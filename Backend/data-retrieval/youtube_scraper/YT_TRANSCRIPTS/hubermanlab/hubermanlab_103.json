    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we're\ndiscussing stimulants in particular\nstimulants for the treatment of ADHD or\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nas many of you know there is tremendous\ninterest in drugs like Adderall Ritalin\nVyvanse and other stimulants as well as\nnon-stimulant prescription drugs that\nhave been shown to improve the symptoms\nof ADHD such as modafinil or modafinil\nand guanfacine today I'm going to\ndiscuss all of these compounds in the\ncontext of how they work to improve the\nsymptoms of ADHD I'm going to address\ncommon questions about these compounds\nsuch as are they just speed are they\nsimilar to meth or Methamphetamine I'll\ntalk about their addictive potential as\nwell as their potential to cause\npsychotic symptoms both in the short and\nlong term and of course I will talk\nabout the scientific literature\nsurrounding the most frequently Asked\nquestion about these compounds which is\nwhat are the long-term consequences of\ntaking any of them in childhood or in\nadulthood now today's discussion centers\naround the use of these compounds both\nfor childhood and for adult ADHD\nbut of course I'd be remiss if I didn't\nacknowledge that there are a tremendous\nnumber of people that use these\nprescription drugs without a\nprescription in order to improve their\nability to focus and indeed also use\nthem recreationally in fact some surveys\nreveal that as high as 80 percent of\ncollege-age young adults have used one\nor several of prescription drugs such as\nadderall Ritalin Vyvanse or similar at\nsome point and are doing so without a\nprescription so they are either\nobtaining those drugs from those that do\nhave prescriptions for them for ADHD or\nthey are obtaining them through Black\nMarket sources which of course carries\nan additional and very serious risk\nrelated to the so-called fentanyl crisis\nthat is as high as 75 percent of black\nmarket drugs nowadays of various kinds\nbut certainly including the sorts of\ndrugs we're going to talk about today\nare contaminated with fentanyl and\ntherefore are very deadly so today I'm\ngoing to describe what these various\ndrugs really are how they work at the\nlevel of neurons and brain networks and\nhow they change those brain networks in\nways that really can allow people with\nADHD to be able to focus better I will\nanswer the common question which is why\nis it that giving children speed because\nindeed several not all but several of\nthe compounds I'm going to discuss are\nspeed they are amphetamine why would\nthat cause a reduction in hyperactivity\nif speed is a stimulant so I'll answer\nthat question for you and I will also\nanswer questions that are commonly asked\nsuch as how these drugs impact things\nlike sleep hormone Health reproductive\nHealth as well as what is their impact\non height indeed it was one prominent\nhypothesis that these ADHD meds could\nactually restrict the height of children\nI'll tell you whether or not that's\nactually true or not and I'll discuss\nthe data surrounding whether or not\nthese drugs predispose people to\nbecoming addicts to other substances\neven if people cease or continue taking\nthe stimulants that can help them in the\nclinical sense for a ADHD before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nMaui Nui venison Maui Nui venison is the\nmost nutrient-dense red meat available\nMaui Nui spent nearly a decade building\na USDA certified wild harvesting system\nto help balance deer populations on the\nisland of Maui the solution they built\nturns the proliferation of an invasive\nspecies into a wide range of\nnutrient-dense products from fresh\nbutcher cuts and organ Meats to bone\nbroth and jerky I'm a particular fan of\ntheir bone broth which has an unmatched\n25 grams of protein per 100 calories and\nI also love the ground venison and the\nvenison steaks talked many times before\non this podcast with expert guests in\nnutrition who make it clear that we\nshould all be getting at least one gram\nof protein per pound of body weight each\nday with Maui Nui venison products\nthat's extremely easy to do and they're\nextremely delicious as well if you'd\nlike to try Maui Nui

eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that are of the absolute\nhighest quality I've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology of the visual\nsystem and I can tell you that your\nvisual system has to contend with an\nenormous number of different challenges\nin order for you to be able to see\nclearly Roca understands all of those\nchallenges at the level of the eye and\nthe visual system within the brain and\nthey've designed their eyeglasses and\nsunglasses so that no matter what\nenvironment you're in you can always see\nwith Crystal Clarity originally their\nglasses were designed for sports and as\na consequence all of their glasses are\nextremely lightweight and as well they\nwon't slip off your face even if you get\nsweaty however despite being designed\ninitially for performance Roca\neyeglasses and sunglasses include a lot\nof different styles that are designed\nfor you to wear to work or out to dinner\nas well as the what I call the cyborg\nstyle they're designed for

diet but most\npeople including myself are not on the\nketogenic diet that is I and most people\neat complex carbohydrates fruits and\nthings of that sort in addition to\nQuality proteins Etc it turns out that\neven if you're not following a ketogenic\ndiet increasing your blood ketones can\nstill have benefits so for instance I\nuse Ketone IQ anytime I want to do\nextended bouts of focused work preparing\nfor podcasts research writing grants and\nif I ever want to exercise but I don't\nhave time to eat or I don't want to have\nmy gut full of food taking Ketone IQ and\nthereby increasing my

early\naccess to tickets once again that's\nhubermanlab.com tour and use the code\nhuberman to access tickets I hope to see\nyou there let's talk about treatments\nfor ADHD and why stimulant treatments in\nparticular can be so effective\nfirst of all it's long been known that\nthere are specific brain networks\ninvolved in what we call attention now\nattention is not one thing actually it\ninvolves several different cognitive\noperations including the suppression of\nnoise that is turning down the\nbackground chatter in our heads and\nturning down our attending to things\noutside us like noises or visual cues\nthat are not relevant to what we want to\ndo and it also involves ramping up or\nattending we're focusing on particular\nthings that are happening either in our\nimmediate environment or in our head or\nboth\nso if that all sounds rather complex\nindeed it is it involves several\ndifferent networks operating in parallel\nbut what we know for sure based on a lot\nof clinical and scientific laboratory\ndata is that the so-called prefrontal\ncortex the region of neural real estate\nin your brain just behind your forehead\nis critically important for\norchestrating which neural circuits are\ngoing to be more or less active at a\ngiven moment in order to bring about\nwhat we call Focus or attention or task\nswitching or our ability indeed to\nmultitask because we can actually\nmultitask to some extent in fact if you\nwere to look at somebody and focus on\nperhaps the expression on their face you\ncould do that while also attending to a\nconversation that's happening nearby\nit's energetically demanding it's hard\nto do but we can do that that's actually\nreferred to as covert attention you're\ncovertly paying attention to something\nelse and then you can switch that\nattention back to just one thing or one\nsmall collection of things the point\nbeing that attention is a powerful\nresource it's what allows us to navigate\nthrough life with efficiency and to be\nadaptive in our behaviors it's what\nallows us to learn and to build\nrelationships and have successful School\ncareers and professional careers and so\non but it is indeed expensive it takes\nmetabolic resources you know just at\nrest if you were to think about\nessentially nothing or whatever just\npops into your mind with no dedicated\neffort toward paying attention to\nanything your brain would consume about\n25 of your daily caloric needs and then\nwhen you lump on top of that your need\nor your attempts to focus on things to\npay attention to specific things\nshould come as no surprise as to why\nthat often can make us feel tired as if\nwe've been working really hard and we've\nbeen running a quote unquote mental\nmarathon when trying to learn and attend\nto things it's hard work for the brain\nand yet we can pay attention because of\nthat very precious real estate just\nbehind our foreheads the prefrontal\ncortex now in people both children and\nadults that have ADHD their prefrontal\ncortex is not necessarily deficient in\nany specific way except that it is not\nas good at orchestrating the activity of\nother brain networks operating in\nparallel with it what do I mean by that\nwell if we take a step back and say what\nis the prefrontal cortex really doing\nthe prefrontal cortex has this amazing\nability through what's called top-down\ninhibition to quiet other brain areas so\nfor instance if you are feeling agitated\nbut you need to sit still your ability\nto sit still even if it takes a bit of\nwork is coordinated by your prefrontal\ncortex sending inhibitory suppressive\nelectrical signals to the networks of\nyour brain that are trying to generate\nphysical action in addition to that if\nyou are in a conversation that's either\na difficult one or a boring one or you\nare tempted to interrupt and you are\nactively holding back your desire to\nwalk away or to yawn or to blurt\nsomething out\nit's your prefrontal cortex that is\ncontrolling that active suppression so\nin many ways you can just think of the\nprefrontal cortex as an Orchestra\nconductor that is essentially saying shh\nor not right now be quiet this is not\nthe time to many different brain\nnetworks all at once\nnow in addition to that your prefrontal\ncortex is coordinating with other brain\nnetworks that are involved in generating\nwhat's called salience or attention to\nparticular signals so the prefrontal\ncortex in many ways is like a teacher or\nan Orchestra conductor it can point to\nin the neurochemical sense that is 0.2 a\ngiven brain structure and say you I'd\nlike to hear more from you right now yes\nyou the student in the back speak up and\na moment later point to a collection of\nsmall students chattering in the back\nagain I'm presenting all this by analogy\nand say hey hey you guys quiet down\nright now so and so is going to come up\nto the front of the room and help us\nwork through this particular math\nproblem so when we hear that the\nprefrontal cortex exerts what's called\nexecutive function\nwhat that refers to is the prefrontal\ncortex's ability to quiet the activity\nof particular neural circuits and to\nenhance or increase the salience of\nother neural circuits that are involved\nin creating our Spotlight of attention\nand what we know for sure based on many\nmany brain Imaging studies is that ADHD\nis not necessarily A deficit in\nprefrontal cortical function but rather\nthe prefrontal cortex's ability to\ncommunicate with other brain areas in\nthe proper ways and so what results in\nthe brain of a person either young or\nold with ADHD is that a lot of the\nbackground chatter becomes very very\nloud so for instance we have a brain\nNetwork called the default mode Network\nthis is a fascinating brain Network this\nis the brain Network that is active when\nyou just sort of sit in place and don't\nthink about much and then you start\nhaving ideas about what you might do\nnext week it tends to be very\nautobiographical so you might remember\nan experience from the past you might\nthink about some of your desires some of\nyour dislikes this default mode Network\nas it's called is also involved in our\nimagination our in our spooling together\nof different experiences that we've had\nit doesn't tend to be the thing that's\nreally focused on anything external in\nparticular all at once\nthe default mode network is always\nactive but it's when we start to attend\nto something especially things external\nto us like it you know something written\non a page or a conversation or something\nthat we really need to learn something\nwe need to pay attention to that the\nactivity of the default mode network is\nsuppressed somewhat and that suppression\noccurs not just by accident but because\nthe prefrontal cortex is actively\nsuppressing it\nin kids and adults with ADHD the default\nmode network is often still active at a\nvery robust level even while we're\ntrying to attend to things and that's\nwhy someone with ADHD will sit down and\ntry and do some focused work and I'll\nstart thinking about something they want\nor something they dislike their internal\nstate will start to distract them and of\ncourse there are other networks in the\nbrain there's actually a what's called a\ntrue salience Network there's the dorsal\nattention Network there are a bunch of\ndifferent networks and brain areas but\nagain\nwhen thinking about ADHD and especially\nwhen thinking about how the drugs that\nwe're going to talk about today work to\nalleviate the symptoms of ADHD\nand in thinking about why so many people\nuse or even abuse these drugs for sake\nof learning or recreationally we might\nsay\nyou start to realize that everything\ncenters back to the prefrontal cortex\nand the prefrontal cortex's ability to\nactively suppress and actively enhance\nthe activity of these multiple brain\nnetworks including default mode networks\naliens Network dorsal attention Network\nEtc\nso rather than overwhelm you with a\nbunch of names of brain areas and brain\nnetworks today I'd really like our\ndiscussion to focus on first what the\nvarious drugs that are used to treat\nADHD are that is how do they work at the\nlevel of neurons\nsecond how they create a certain set of\nconditions that allow their prefrontal\ncortex to be a better conductor\nthird how that can be leveraged during\ndevelopment to actually teach the\nprefrontal cortex of a young child to\nlearn to be a better conductor because\nthat's really the Hallmark of the use of\nthese drugs is to try and enhance the\nactivity of particular circuits to\ncreate a sort of learning so that the\nprefrontal cortex is much more efficient\nat doing its job of conducting and then\nfourth we're going to talk about the\nvarious things that I think most people\nout there ask about when they hear about\ndrugs like Adderall Vyvanse and Ritalin\nEtc which is you know are they addictive\nwhy are they addictive can one use them\nbriefly or even from time to time and\nstill be okay what if I use them as a\nchild and I don't want to be on them\nanymore should I put my child on these\ndrugs Etc it is I believe only by\nunderstanding the biology of how these\ndrugs work\nand their potential both to improve\nbrain function but also some of the\ndangers associated with these drugs that\none can really answer those questions\nfor themselves or for their children\nokay so let's start with a very basic\nbut critical question which is why in\nthe world would amphetamines speed or\nother stimulants improve the symptoms of\nADHD\nthat's so critical to answer because if\nyou think about it the prefrontal cortex\nneeds to coordinate the actions of these\nother circuits\nand so just increasing the amount of\nactivity in prefrontal cortex you can\nimagine would create a state of hyper\nFocus perhaps but actually that's not\nthe case if you just were to ramp up the\nactivity of prefrontal Cortex what you\nwould find is that somebody would become\neven less efficient at paying attention\nto what they wanted to rather they would\npay attention to whatever was presented\nin front of them with laser focus they\nwould lock on to essentially anything\nand that's not good one of the key\nthings about prefrontal cortex is that\nit needs to be flexible it needs to be\nable to pay attention to this then it\nneeds to be able to pay attention to\nthat then it needs to go back to paying\nattention to the thing it was paying\nattention to previously and so on and so\nforth life that is an effective adaptive\nlife a good life consists of\nself-directing one's attention most all\nof the time so why would stimulants do\nthat well\nalmost all not all but almost all of the\ndrugs used to treat ADHD fall under the\ncategory of stimulants or what are\ncalled sympathomimetics\nsympathomimetic refers to the fact that\nwe naturally have a component of our\nnervous system called the autonomic\nnervous system the autonomic nervous\nsystem has two major components one is\ncalled the sympathetic arm of the\nautonomic nervous system has nothing to\ndo with sympathy has everything to do\nwith ramping up our level of attention\nand arousal it is the so-called fight or\nflight aspect of our nervous system or\nrather it mediates fight or flight but\nimmediates a bunch of other things too\nincluding sexual arousal including\nexcitement and focus about something\nthat we want to learn or somebody that\nwe want to learn more about or\nremembering a phone number or anything\nthat puts us into a state of alertness\nand focus\nthe other arm of the autonomic nervous\nsystem is the so-called parasympathetic\narm of the autonomic nervous system and\nthat's often referred to as the\nso-called rest and digest component of\nour nervous system and yes it controls\nrest indeed it puts us into sleep\nand yes it's involved in digestion but\nit's involved in a bunch of other things\nas well including sexual arousal\nincluding rates of digestion including\nsalivation including all sorts of things\nthat don't just have to do with resting\nand digesting\nthe way to think about the autonomic\nnervous system is it's a sort of seesaw\nso it's always at a balance someplace\nbetween either predominantly sympathetic\nor predominantly parasympathetic but\nboth the parasympathetic and the\nsympathetic arms of the autonomic\nnervous system are always active all the\ntime it's not as if one is completely\nactive and the others shut off even in\nsleep your sympathetic nervous system is\nnot completely turned off and even\nduring a panic attack your\nparasympathetic nervous system is not\ncompletely turned off\ndrugs to treat ADHD\nwhich are fall under the category of\nstimulants are sympathomimetics because\nthey trigger the release of\nneurochemicals and the activation of\ncomponents of our nervous system that\nvery much resemble the activation of the\nso-called sympathetic nervous system the\none that makes us more alert and more\naroused so that's why they're called\nsympathomimetics and the word stimulant\nrefers to a general category of drugs\nthat are sympathomimetics now the most\ncommonly discussed sympathomimetic is\none that fortunately is not\nprescribed for ADHD and that's\nmethamphetamine these days we hear a lot\nabout meth\nmeth which is methylated amphetamine is\nan extremely potent sympathomimetic and\nit has tremendous abuse potential\nBelieve It or Not meth or\nMethamphetamine is actually available as\na prescription drug but it is used very\nrarely because of its high abuse\npotential and all the terrible things\nthat it can do in terms of\ncardiovascular health in terms of oral\nhealth right there's this stereotype\nthat meth users have very degraded teeth\nand indeed they do there's a reason for\nthat related to how meth impacts the\nbrain and body I'm going to talk a\nlittle bit about methamphetamine a\nlittle bit later but let's just Place\nmethamphetamine high on the Shelf as the\nmost\npotent sympathomimetic that's out there\nbecause even though it's not often\nprescribed for ADHD there are class of\ncompounds very similar to it that have a\nvery similar pattern of action\nthat is not quite as potent but that\nleverages the same underlying mechanisms\nand they are very commonly prescribed\nfor ADHD namely Adderall and Vyvanse so\nfirst let's talk about Adderall and what\nAdderall is Adderall is a combination of\nwhat are called amphetamine salts\namphetamine salts refers to the fact\nthat there are two major forms of\namphetamine there's a d amphetamine or\ndexoramphetamine and levo amphetamine or\nL amphetamine so I'll refer to these as\nD and L amphetamine and for you\nchemistry-minded folks out there the D\nand the L also refer to the fact that\nthere is a l left-handed version of the\nmolecule and there's a d or right-handed\nversion of the molecule\nthis is only important to understand\ninsofar as you know that the D and the L\nforms of the molecule look very similar\nbut they're mirror images of one another\nand yet they can have very different\nactions in the brain and body so\nAdderall is a three to one ratio of D\namphetamine to L amphetamine\nyou should know that L amphetamine tends\nto be less potent in increasing certain\nneurochemicals in the brain I'll talk\nabout which neurochemicals they are in a\nmoment then is D amphetamine so D\namphetamine is potent stuff not as\npotent as methamphetamine but very\npotent stuff\nl-amphetamine a little bit less potent\nL amphetamine tends to be the\namphetamine that increases blood\npressure and heart rate what we call\nperipheral\neffects because it happens in the\nperiphery outside the central nervous\nsystem\nperipheral effects like increased heart\nrate increased blood pressure sweating\nEtc\nare mostly activated by L amphetamine\nwhereas D amphetamine tends to work\nmainly on receptors in the brain and\ntherefore have effects mainly restricted\nto the brain\nnow what are these effects that I've\nbeen referring to\nthe major effect of Adderall and other\nsympathomimetic stimulants is to\nincrease the activity of two\nneurochemicals the first of those\nneurochemicals is dopamine and the other\nof those neurochemicals is\nnorepinephrine first off I want to be\nclear that when I say norepinephrine I\ncould just as easily say nor adrenaline\nbecause those are the exact same thing\nand forgive me even though I wasn't the\none to name the same thing two different\nthings\nI'll try and stay with norepinephrine\nbut I may say noradrenaline they are the\nsame thing there's a whole story as to\nhow they got named\ntwo different things but it's the same\nthing\nthe major effect of Adderall and other\nsympathomimetic stimulants is to\nincrease\nthe transmission of dopamine and\nnorepinephrine so what does dopamine and\nwhat is neuropinephrine well both\ndopamine and norepinephrine are what are\ncalled neuromodulators that is they have\nthe ability to increase or decrease the\nfiring patterns the electrical activity\nof particular brain circuits\nboth dopamine and norepinephrine have\nseparate roles in creating certain\nStates within our brain and body but\nthey like to collaborate meaning they\ntend to be released at similar locations\nin the brain in order to deliver us to a\nparticular state of mind and or body\nso if we were to take a look at just\ndopamine we would find that dopamine is\nreleased at sites within the brain and\nincreases the activity of brain networks\nthat for the most part lead to increases\nin motivation Pursuit and to some extent\nmood\nif we were to look at norepinephrine and\nwhere it's released in the brain it\ntends to be released at many not all but\nmany of the same sites where dopamine is\nreleased and the main function of\nnorepinephrine is to increase the\nactivity of neural networks that are\ninvolved in attention and focus to\nparticular things in our environment\nokay so think of dopamine and\nnorepinephrine as collaborators because\nindeed they are\nand actually they're very\nneurochemically similar as well it\nactually just takes one chemical\nconversion to turn dopamine into\nnorepinephrine so they are very similar\nthey're like close cousins that work\ntogether to help us achieve a common\ngoal that involves increased motivation\nfocus and alertness\nso when we talk about attention in ADHD\nor we talk about quieting the\nhyperactivity or impulsivity of ADHD one\nof the reasons why drugs that are\neffective in treating ADHD are so\neffective is because they increase\nmotivation focus and alertness and they\ntend to do that at very focal locations\nin the brain it's worth taking a couple\nof minutes to think about how\nsympathomimetics such as adderall\nactually increase dopamine and\nnorepinephrine they do so by affecting a\ncouple of specific operations at the\nso-called synapse what are synapses\nsynapses are the communication points\nbetween neurons they're actually the\nspaces between neurons but that's where\na lot of the action is when neurons as\nwe say are stimulating the next neuron\nor activating the next neuron or\ninhibiting the next neuron the word\nneuron just simply refers to nerve cell\nand so what nerve cells have is they\nhave a cell body that contains their DNA\nand a bunch of other stuff they have a\nlong wire like process which is referred\nto as an axon and at the end of that\naxon there are a bunch of proteins in\nthere that do really interesting things\nso for instance there are proteins down\nat the end of the axon that package\nneurotransmitter into little spherical\nthings that we call vesicles\nthose vesicles can fuse with the end of\nthe axon and vomit the contents those\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic\ncleft into that little space between\nneurons and then if enough of those\nneurotransmitters bind to receptors on\nWhat's called the postsynaptic side\nwhich simply means the neuron on the\nother side well then the next neuron\nwill become active and then the signal\nwill propagate from one neuron to the\nnext now I just described that whole\nprocess pretty quickly and I like to\nthink pretty simply but it actually\ninvolves a lot of different protein bits\nand some pretty complex Machinery in\norder to make that happen\nI don't want to over complicate our\nconversation but what I will tell you is\nthat down in the synapse in the\npresynaptic terminal\nthe neuron that is going to release\nneurotransmitter there are what are\ncalled Transporters which sit there and\nsuck up or suck back up\nsome of the neurotransmitter that's been\nreleased\nthere are dopamine Transporters and\nthere are norepinephrine or\nnoradrenergic Transporters down in the\nsynapse\nwhat Adderall does and what other\nsympathomimetics do\nis to inhibit or disrupt the action of\nthose Transporters and the net\nconsequence of that is that when\ndopamine and or epinephrine are released\ninto the synapse more of it is allowed\nto stick around and to binder receptors\non the postsynaptic cell\nthan would be the case if Adderall or\nthe other stimulant were not present in\nthe system so one way that Adderall\nincreases dopamine and norepinephrine is\nby disrupting the activity of these\npresynaptic Transporters for dopamine\nand norepinephrine the other way that\nAdderall increases dopamine and\nnorepinephrine is that it disrupts the\nactivity of a different piece of\nMachinery in the presynaptic neuron\nwhich is called a vmat the vesicle\nmonoamine transporter 2. if you really\nwant to get specific you don't have to\nremember these names but what these\nvmats do is actually really cool what\nthey do is they actually take whatever\ntransmitter has been brought back up\ninto the cell by Transporters and they\npackage it into those vesicles that are\nthen going to be released\nby disrupting the Transporters that\nvacuum back up some of the dopamine or\nnorepinephrine that's been released\nand by also disrupting the packaging\nof dopamine and norepinephrine into\nvesicles themselves what ends up\nhappening is that there's a buildup of a\nlot more dopamine and norepinephrine in\nthe presynaptic terminal so that when an\nelectrical signal travels down the\nneuron now the total amount of dopamine\nand norepinephrine that's released is\nincreased\nokay so what's happening when you take\nAdderall is that you're getting more out\nof the dopamine and norepinephrine that\nyou're releasing and you're releasing\nmore dopamine and norepinephrine\naltogether and there's a third mechanism\nby which Adderall increases the amount\nof dopamine and norepinephrine present\nin synapses\nand therefore can act on other neurons\nand that has to do with disruption of\nthe entire network between these\ndifferent proteins\nI'm not going to go into that in any\ndetail because it gets somewhat\ncomplicated in terms of the cell biology\nand some of the biochemistry down at the\ntips of these axons but suffice to say\nthat Adderall is such an effective\nsympathomimetic\nthat is it can increase dopamine to such\na great extent especially compared to\nother treatments for ADHD because of its\nability to increase dopamine release and\ntransmission and therefore action as\nwell as noradrenergic release and\ntransmission and action down there in\nthe synapse and it's worth pointing out\nthat most of the effect of Adderall is\nan increasing dopamine as opposed to\nnorepinephrine it does increase\nnorepinephrine but its major effects we\nshould say the major effects that have\nmade it such an attractive drug to so\nmany people both for the treatment of\nADHD and for people to take\nrecreationally or off prescription or\nfor sake of studying or work simply\nbecause they want to focus more and\nlonger is because of its ability to\nincrease dopamine to such a great extent\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be in the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 now a\nbit earlier I mentioned that L\namphetamine levo amphetamine is present\nin Adderall but\nat one quarter the amount of D\namphetamine okay so there's a little bit\nof l-amphetamine and a lot of\ndamphetamine in Adderall many of you are\nprobably familiar with vivance Vyvanse\nis a commercial name for what many\npeople think is extended release\nAdderall but actually Vyvanse is not\nextended release Adderall Vivant is a\ndrug in which the pharmaceutical\nindustry has taken one component of\nAdderall just the D amphetamine\ncomponent and attached to it an amino\nacid called lysine now the amino acid\nlysine is a big amino acid and the\nattaching of Lysine to D amphetamine\nwhat we call vivance makes it what's\ncalled a pro drug it actually can't have\nany effect on its own but when one takes\nVyvanse and it's broken down in the gut\nbut to a greater extent actually in the\nbloodstream the lysines are cleaved off\nslowly over time and as a consequence\nVyvanse is basically timed release\ndmphetamine this is important because I\nthink a lot of people think that\nAdderall which again is D amphetamine\nand L amphetamine and those two things\noperate quite a bit differently at the\nlevel of norepinephrine and epinephrine\nand cardiac versus brain effects a lot\nof people think Vyvanse is just slow\nrelease Adderall but it is not what\nvivance is is D amphetamine only but in\ntime release form and Vyvanse was\nactually developed as a way to try and\nget around or rather prevent some of the\nabuse potential of Adderall and Other\nDrugs that contain damphetamine\nD amphetamine stands for dextra\namphetamine and in the 70s and 80s there\nwere a fair amount of movies and there\nwas a lot of trafficking and there was a\nlot of criminal activity related to what\nwas called dexedrine dexedrine is pure D\namphetamine so if we're going to be very\ndirect if I were going to just frame\nthese things in the context of their\nneurochemistry what I can tell you is\nthat vivance is time release dexedrine\nit's not time release Adderall now just\nbecause there were movies and reports of\ncriminal activity related to dexedrine\nthat doesn't necessarily mean that\ndexedrine is not an effective and useful\npharmaceutical in fact vivance which is\nTime released dexedrine has proved to be\nvery effective in the treatment of ADHD\nfor a lot of people and the reason for\nthat is this time release does indeed\nprevent abuse in the sense that despite\npeople's many attempts from what I hear\nto increase the rate of Entry of the\ndamphetamine into their system by either\nsnorting it or you know God forbid even\ninjecting it and things of that sort the\nattaching of that lysine to damphetamine\nreally does slow the absorption so when\nsomebody takes Vyvanse and hopefully\npeople are taking it responsibly when\nthey take Vyvanse what they're really\ngetting is a slow trickle of\ndamphetamine into their system and\ntherefore a slow long lasting increase\nin dopamine and norepinephrine and\nindeed that's what happens the effects\nof Vyvanse can extend over anywhere from\n12 to 16 sometimes even 18 hours\ndepending on how quickly somebody\nmetabolizes it and I should say that\nthere is no way to predict how quickly\none will metabolize any of these drugs\nexcept by trying them that's one of the\nsort of downsides of the state of things\nthese days there's no blood test or\nenzymatic test that will tell you\nwhether or not you're going to be a fast\nmetabolizer or a slow metabolizer and\nthat's why people just have to sort\nthrough different dosages which we'll\ntalk about in a little bit they have to\nsort through different types of\nsympathomagnetics you know some people\ntry Adderall and they find that you know\nthe quick time course of Adderall or at\nleast quick for them of about six to\neight hours is just too fast and then it\nwears off and they get into a slump in\nthe afternoon other people find that one\nAdderall taken at six a.m will have them\ngoing all day long and into the night\nand it's just too much stimulation and\nthey need to come way way down in dose\nor they need to think about other\nsympathomimetics for ADHD and we'll talk\nabout what some of those other options\nare a little bit as well so the\nimportant thing to understand is that\nAdderall is really Two drugs DNL\namphetamine vivance is D amphetamine\nwhich is also called dexedrine but with\nthis time released aspect created by\nlumping a lysine on there and you may\nnotice that I haven't mentioned one of\nthe major\ndrugs used to treat ADHD and that's\nritalin or what sometimes also called\nConcerta depending on again the time\nrelease forms Etc Ritalin was very\ncommonly prescribed for the treatment of\nADHD early in the days of using\nsympathomimetics in order to treat ADHD\nso for instance I went to college in the\nearly 90s so I started college in 93 and\nI graduated in 98. it was one year in\nthere as a let's call it a transition\nyear I can recall hearing that Ritalin\nwas being prescribed for ADHD in kids\nand I like many other people were\nwondering what are the long-term\nconsequences of this going to be I also\nlike many other people was very\nperplexed as to why a stimulant\nsympathomimetic like Ritalin was being\nprescribed for hyperactive kids that\nwill become clear in a moment but\nwe don't hear so much about Ritalin\nnowadays and I think that's because\nAdderall and Vyvanse and things like\nthem have become so popular for the\ntreatment of ADHD\nit's worth noting that Ritalin is not\nactually amphetamine\nRitalin is what's called methylphenidate\nand methylphenidate Works in a lot of\nways that are similar to the way that\nAdderall and Vyvanse work\nbut there are certain ways in which it's\ndifferent now Ritalin methylphenidate\ndoes increase dopamine transmission at\nsynapses and it does so also by\ninhibiting the function of that\npresynaptic dopamine transporter that\nwould otherwise suck more dopamine back\nup into the presynaptic cell\nmethylphenidate Ritalin\nalso disrupts the activity of the\nnoradrenergic transporter leading to net\nincreases in the amount of\nnorepinephrine at the synapse but it is\nnot as much a potent inhibitor of the\nnoradrenergic transporter and therefore\nmost of the effect of methylphenidate is\nto increase dopamine at synapses a lot\nof people don't realize this a lot of\npeople think that Ritalin is just very\nshort-acting Adderall and that's not the\ncase it is true that Ritalin at least in\nits standard form tends to have a pretty\nshort half-life and therefore its\neffects basically kick in about 20 to 40\nminutes after taking it sometimes a\nlittle bit sooner sometimes a little\nlater and they last about four to six\nhours as opposed to the six to eight\nhours typical of Adderall but Ritalin is\nnot short-acting Adderall Ritalin is\nmainly increasing dopamine and to some\nextent norepinephrine at synapses\nwhereas Adderall and vivance are\nincreasing both dopamine and\nnorepinephrine to a much greater extent\nand for those of you that are interested\nin the underlying cell biological reason\nfor that it has something to do with\nritalin's relatively lower affinity for\nthe neuroadrenergic transporter but it's\nalso because remember I listed off three\nmechanisms by which Adderall\nand by extension Vyvanse increased\ndopamine and norepinephrine transmission\nright disruption the transporter\ndisruption of the vmat2 as well as a\ndisruption of the whole kind of complex\nof communication between those proteins\nwell Ritalin is really only tapping into\nthe Drug's ability to disrupt the\ndopamine and noradrenergic transporter\nso it's three mechanisms of increasing\ndopamine and norepinephrine for Adderall\nand Vyvanse\nand by extension dexedrine and it's only\none mechanism for Ritalin to increase\ndopamine and norepinephrine and therein\nmostly dopamine so if we take a step\nback for a moment from all these drugs\nand all this cell biology of neurons and\nso forth\nand we go back to the brain networks\ninvolved in attention remember the\norchestra model or the teacher model\nwhere the prefrontal cortex really sits\nin top seat in terms of coordinating the\nactions both the quieting and the yes\nplease speak\nactions of the brain really bringing\nabout what we think of as focused\nattention and task switching all the\nstuff that goes along with learning and\nfocus and cognition well\nwhat we know is that dopamine and\nnorepinephrine which are differentially\nincreased by these different drugs that\nwe've been talking about\nalso differentially impact\nthe various aspects of executive\nfunction of the prefrontal cortex\nincreasing our attention for specific\nthings and while there is a lot of\nnuance in the literature about this we\ncan safely say a couple of things first\nof all\nincreasing dopamine at particular\nsynapses and networks in the brain can\nserve as what's called noise reduction\nit can help further enhance the quieting\nof all that background stuff that\nbackground stuff can be attention to\nthings in your environment like noises\nor visual cues it could be some internal\nnarrative that you had about yesterday\nor something that somebody said about\nyou or something that somebody you like\nwould like to say about you or whatever\nit might be that's happening in your\nhead that's distracting you as well as\nyour representation of your internal\nbodily State what we call interoception\nthis is a really important aspect of\nattention that we don't often hear about\nwhich is that we have the ability to\nattend to things outside of us which is\ncalled exteroception as well as\nan ability to attend to things inside of\nus which include things like thoughts\nbut also includes you know for instance\nhow empty or full our gut feels whether\nor not we're comfortable in our chair\nyou know when we think about the\npractice of focus and learning or\nfocusing as a verb\nit involves often forcing ourselves to\nsit still it often involves us\nsuppressing the fact that our foot is a\nlittle bit cramped or that we might need\nto use the restroom for you know we\nmight want to delay that for 10-15\nminutes even though it might be fairly\nurgent all these sorts of things\nare Central to our ability to attend and\nfocus and so dopamine while it does many\ndifferent things in the brain many many\ndifferent things one of its main\nfunctions in the context of all this\nprefrontal cortex and attention stuff is\nto quiet the amount of noise that is it\nhelps the prefrontal cortex suppress the\nsignals that would otherwise distract us\ninto thinking about oh yeah I'm kind of\nthirsty right now or I need to use the\nrestroom or I really want to make this\ncaller I really really want to pick up\nmy phone all of that stuff all of that\nsuppression that shh that quieting down\nof all the background chatter related to\nthings external and internal to us in\nour head and our body is greatly\nfacilitated by having more dopamine\npresent in the synapses that allow for\nwhat we call noise reduction now in\nparallel to that is norepinephrine\nnorepinephrine is released from multiple\nsites in the brain and body but within\nthe brain there's one major site of\nneurons that manufacture norepinephrine\nand the name of that site is Locus\nceruleus it sits in the back of the\nbrain it's actually a relatively small\ncollection of neurons but they are very\nvery powerful they extend their little\naxons their wires to multiple locations\nin the brain and they release\nnorepinephrine at those locations so\nthink of them sort of as a sprinkler\nsystem that originates from one very\nfocal location but that can sprinkle\nnorepinephrine at multiple locations in\nthe brain and the amazing thing about\nLocus ceruleus and that sprinkler system\nis that indeed the sprinkler system can\nbe pretty widespread where everywhere\nthere's a sprinkler head\nsomebody's getting norepinephrine but it\nalso can fairly focally release\nnorepinephrine at particular sites so\nwhile in the context of today's\ndiscussion dopamine is acting largely to\nimpart noise reduction\nnorepinephrine has the ability to boost\nsignals at synapses to increase the\namplitude and frequency of communication\nbetween neurons and in that way in the\ncontext of today's discussion\nnorepinephrine when released at the\nparticular synapses in the particular\nbrain networks that are related to\nattention and learning is largely\nserving to increase signal so what we\nhave in the context of a drug like\nAdderall or vivance or to some extent\nmethylphenidate Ritalin does this as\nwell is an increase in dopamine and\nneuro epinephrine that is leading to two\nthings both a reduction in noise a\nquieting of the circuitry that we don't\nwant to hear so much from and an\nincrease in the signal of the networks\nthat we do want to pay attention to and\nthe net effect of that noise reduction\nand Signal amplification is what the\nengineers refer to as increased signal\nto noise and the consequence of that is\na heightened subjective sense or ability\nto decide what we want to focus on sit\ndown or stand there and just focus on it\nso the way that we've been discussing\ndrugs to treat ADHD and their ability to\nincrease dopamine and norepinephrine and\nthereby to reduce the amount of noise so\nto speak in the brain and to increase\nthe amount of signal related to things\nthat we want to attend to all presumes\nthat the amount of dopamine and the\namount of norepinephrine that's being\nincreased is perfect for what we want to\naccomplish which is increased focus and\nreduced hyperactivity and impulsivity\nbut of course in the real world that's\nnot always the case depending on the\ndosage of the drug one sensitivity to\nthe drug even what stage of development\nacross the lifespan a person is at\nthings can really go Haywire pretty fast\nand what I'm referring to when I say\nHaywire is if you think about dopamine\nand its ability to reduce noise well\ndopamine does a bunch of other things as\nwell and in fact we know that if\ndopamine is increased too much in the\nbrain somebody that has ADHD or somebody\nthat doesn't have ADHD people can become\neuphoric people can become manic people\ncan even become psychotic likewise if\nnorepinephrine is increased too much\npeople won't just become alert they will\nbecome very anxious have panic attacks\nand depending on the drug they're taking\nthey may even experience very serious\nperipheral symptoms meaning elevated\nheart rate and sweating that is super\nuncomfortable and on and on so\neverything I've been discussing up until\nnow is true but I want to make it clear\nthat it's true in the context of\nappropriately dosed prescribed drug for\na given condition which leads us to the\nnext question which is why would it be\nthat giving these drugs which are in\nfact stimulants why would that calm a\nkid down why would that common adult\nwith ADHD down and the answer to that is\nnot completely straightforward and it is\nworth pointing out that not everyone\nwith ADHD has impulsivity and\nhyperactivity and therefore an inability\nto focus some kids and adults with ADHD\ndo have challenges with impulsivity and\nhyperactivity some do not some just have\nchallenges with focus and I did an\nentire episode about ADHD and we are\ngoing to have an expert guest on this\npodcast who specializes in the treatment\nof ADHD to talk about some of these\nissues further but I just want to remind\neverybody that\nas in the general population children\nand adults with ADHD are capable of very\nconcentrated periods of focus\nthe pattern however tends to be that\nchildren and adults with ADHD have a\nharder time getting into that state of\nfocus and perhaps most importantly they\nhave a very hard time getting into a\nforced state of focus for things that\nthey don't enjoy doing I'm sure many of\nyou are also thinking wait I don't like\nto do certain things and it's harder to\nfocus on those things than on the things\nI like of course does that mean I have\nADHD and the answer is not necessarily\nso\nkids and adults with ADHD exhibit an\nextreme variation in their ability to\nfocus such that if there's something\nthey really really like doing they can\nindeed Focus however for many many other\nactivities that are required in order to\ndevelop I guess we'll just call it\nnormal life advancement so sitting still\nlistening to conversations that we may\nnot be particularly interested in that's\nwhere the challenges come about so the\npoint is that these brain networks and\nthese neuromodulators like dopamine and\nnorepinephrine that we've been talking\nabout in Fairly straightforward terms\nas it relates to a Drug's ability to\nincrease their transmission and\ntherefore an improved ability of focus\npresumes two things it presumes that the\ndosing is right that is that the levels\nof increases in these neuromodulators is\njust right and I also just want to\nacknowledge that ADHD is first of all\nnot an inability to focus at all it is\nimmense challenges in focusing on lots\nof different things as required for\nnormal life progression and it's also\nthe case that there is no one specific\npattern of ADHD that applies to everyone\nwith ADHD some people both kids and\nadults will exhibit the hyperactivity\nbut not the impulsivity although those\ntwo things tend to go hand in hand some\npeople will have a challenge in focus\nwithout hyperactivity impulsivity and so\nforth and all this just really speaks to\nthe complexity of ADHD and yet and yet\nwe can confidently say that there are\nmore drugs to treat ADHD than any other\npsychiatric condition we've talked about\na few of those now but among those\nAdderall vivance Ritalin also called\nmethylphenol State there are time\nrelease versions there are\ndifferent variations on those time\nrelease versions there's even straight\ndexedrine which is prescribed for ADHD\nin some cases and on and on and you\nmight also find it interesting to know\nthat that very large kit of drugs all of\nwhich at least the ones we've talked\nabout so far are sympathome addicts or\nstimulants\nare more effective\nat treating ADHD than are any other\ncollection of drugs for treating other\npsychiatric disorders so what all of\nthat diversity of symptomology and ADHD\nas well as\ndifferences in sensitivity to drugs and\nindividual variation what all of that\nspeaks to is that the large kit of drugs\nthat's out there is designed to be\nassessed with the careful consult of a\nvery qualified psychiatrist in order to\nallow the child or adult to arrive at\nthe specific drug and the specific\ndosage that's ideal for their particular\npattern of ADHD and that issue actually\ngives rise to the answer to that now\nsomewhat age-old question as to why\ngiving stimulants to a kid that is\nhyperactive would calm them down and the\nanswer is that the hyperactivity\nimpulsivity and focus issues present in\nADHD in children and adults are the\nconsequence not necessarily of deficient\nactivity of neural circuits in the\nprefrontal cortex or deficient activity\nof the default mode Network or deficient\nactivity of the salience network Etc\nwhat appears to be the case based on a\nlot of high quality neuroimaging data is\nthat the brains of children and adults\nwith ADHD have all of these networks\nfunctioning but those networks are\nactually hyper connected that is they\ntend to be co-active at times when\nordinarily meaning\nkids and adults without ADHD they would\nnot be co-active\nso that's an important point because\nit's easy to get the impression that\nADHD is just a deficiency in dopamine\nand norepinephrine and that's simply not\nthe case if you recall dopamine and\nnorepinephrine are neuromodulators they\nmodulate the activity of other neural\ncircuits and they can both increase and\ndecrease activity within those circuits\nso you don't necessarily want to think\nabout dopamine and norepinephrine just\nas molecules that increase neural\nactivity and you certainly don't want to\nthink about ADHD it's just a deficiency\nin dopamine or deficiency in\nnorepinephrine the way these drugs work\nwhen they are used effectively to treat\nADHD is to tune the amount of dopamine\nand norepinephrine that are present in\nparticular brain networks in order to\nallow the person to arrive at just the\nright balance between the activation of\nthese different neural circuits causing\nthem largely to be less synchronous in\ntheir firing so this takes us back to\nthis question why giving stimulants to a\nkid would calm them down it's not so\nmuch that you're giving a stimulant to a\nkid to place them into a state of calm I\nthink that's a common misconception\nrather by increasing dopamine and\nnorepinephrine these drugs yes increase\nlevels of overall autonomic arousal they\nare after all sympathomimetics but more\nimportantly to the treatment of ADHD\nsymptoms you are activating the\nprefrontal cortex in a way that allows\nit to be more of a coordinator of that\nOrchestra conductor or if you prefer the\nanalogy to a teacher in the classroom to\nramp up the activity of certain neural\ncircuits in a given moment and quiet\ndown the activity of other neural\ncircuits such that the default mode\nNetwork can still perform its incredible\nactions after all the default mode\nnetwork is involved not just in\nself-referencing and kind of daydreaming\nbut also creativity and Imagination\nthat's been well described in the\nliterature as well as the salience\nnetwork and these other networks that\nare designed to drop us into very narrow\ntrenches of attention\nthese drugs for the treatment of ADHD\nare are indeed stimulants but the goal\nof prescribing these drugs to a child or\nadult with ADHD is to adjust dosage\ntiming and the duration over which\nsomebody takes it in their lifespan in\norder to allow those neural circuits to\nwork in the proper way meaning for the\nconductor to activate the instruments in\nthat little symphony or band in the\nappropriate order in order to arrive at\nthe right music as opposed to all the\ninstruments playing at once which would\njust be complete noise or if again if\nyou prefer the classroom teaching\nanalogy for the teacher to call on one\nstudent while the others are quiet and\nthen to call on a different student have\none student return to their seats to\nhave the students work in small groups\nagain all of this by analogy\nthe point being that dopamine and\nnorepinephrine are all allowing these\nnetworks to be activated to the\nprecisely correct levels and in the\nprecisely correct sequence now the other\nkey aspect of drugs like Adderall\nVyvanse Ritalin and similar to tree ADHD\nhas everything to do with these\nneuromodulators dopamine and\nnorepinephrine but it has to do with\ntheir other incredible feature besides\njust their ability to reduce noise and\nincrease signal Within These brain\nnetworks and that incredibly important\nfeature is what we call neuroplasticity\nor the brain and nervous system's\nability to change in response to\nexperience I've done entire episodes of\nThe huberman Lab podcast on\nneuroplasticity what it is and how to\naccess it at different stages of\ndevelopment and in adulthood by the way\nyou can find those episodes at\nhubermanlab.com by simply searching\nplasticity in the search function but\nthe important thing to understand about\nplasticity in the context of today's\ndiscussion is that while there are many\ndifferent ways to induce neuroplasticity\nalmost all of them almost all of them\ninvolve\nstrongly activating certain brain\nNetworks\nand in that case also strong or elevated\nrelease of certain neuromodulators\nnow we've talked about dopamine and\nnorepinephrine they are but two of many\nneuromodulators others include serotonin\nacetylcholine and each of the\nneuromodulators does different things\nthat different synapses in the brain and\nthere's some Global statements that can\nbe made about each of them we've made\nsome of those earlier like dopamine is\nbroadly involved in motivation craving\nand pursuit and norepinephrine and\nSignal detection and drawing of focus or\nsalience to something in our environment\nor in our body or inner experience\nserotonin does other things\nacetylcholine does other things but\nwhat's really important to understand is\nthat any time there is a dramatic\nelevation in dopamine and norepinephrine\nrelative to Baseline relative to what\nwas happening with dopamine and\nnorepinephrine just prior to that that\nhas a tendency to promote\nneuroplasticity at particular synapses\nso here is where it's appropriate to\nremind everybody that neuromodulators\nare different than neurotransmitters\nneurotransmitters are chemicals that\njust like dopamine and norepinephrine\nare released between neurons and they\nare what actually contribute to the\nelectrical signals going up or down\nbetween different neurons and again\ndopamine and norepinephrine modulate\nthat activity causing a given amount of\nneurotransmitter to have an even greater\neffect\nfor instance so when we hear about\ndopamine and norepinephrine and we hear\nabout motivation or Focus Etc that's all\nfine and good but it's also important to\nremember that when dopamine and\nnorepinephrine are increased there is a\nhigher probability of strengthening\nconnections where dopamine and\nnorepinephrine are increased and what\nthat means is that later even if levels\nof dopamine and norepinephrine are not\nincreased if they go back to Baseline\nit's often the case that if in our prior\nhistory or the history of a given set of\nneurons in our brain there was more\ndopamine or norepinephrine around\nit's very likely that the connections\nwhere that took place are strengthened\nand therefore more easily activated and\nthis takes us back to the really\noriginal purpose of prescribing the\nsympathomimetic stimulants to children\nwith ADHD during development\nit was yes\ndesigned to try and help them Focus to\nreduce their hyperactivity and help them\nFocus but it was also designed to help\nthe brain networks that are responsible\nfor Focus to undergo neuroplasticity\nthat is for the synapses involved to\nstrengthen so that those networks could\nfunction more efficiently later on even\nafter cessation of the drug this is an\nabsolutely crucial point that I think is\nnot often discussed when people for\ninstance say should I put my kid on ADHD\nmeds or should I take my kid off of ADHD\nmeds as they transition from adolescence\nto their later teen years and into\ncollege I mean after all no child or a\nparent or adult for that matter wants to\nachieve a bunch of benefits with a drug\nand then lose those benefits later\nnor does any parent or child want to\ntake a drug that they don't need to take\nwhen they could access other routes to\nimproving the neural circuitry or the\nfunction of some health system in the\nbody because I don't think anyone really\nwants to medicate their kids unless they\nhave to I would hope not and I don't\nthink any kid wants to be medicated\nunless they absolutely need to be\nmedicated so increasing dopamine and\nnorepinephrine with these drugs like\nAdderall Vyvanse Ritalin and similar\nis causing several things and some of\nthose things actually provide some\ngeneral answers as to whether or not\nparents should put their kids on these\ncompounds in the first place obviously\nthey're going to do that in the under\nthe careful consult of a qualified\npsychiatrist I would hope and only under\nthose circumstances but also whether or\nnot the child should stay on those drugs\nover time\nand here's what we do know for sure\nI did a vast search within the\nliterature in order to arrive at what is\nvery clear which is that children with\nADHD true ADHD who are diagnosed with\nADHD and are treated with appropriate\ndoses of drugs like Adderall ritalin or\nVyvanse\nthey're far better both in childhood and\nlater in life when it comes to\nPerformance in school\nperformance in terms of focusing on\nanything and in terms of General\noutcomes so for instance a lot of people\nhave wondered and worried about whether\nor not treatment with these drugs early\nin life will set up a predisposition for\nillicit drug abuse or craving an\naddictive potential later and it is very\nclear from the studies that have emerged\nover the last really 15 years but mainly\nwithin the last five years\nthat's when most of the data have\narrived that children with ADHD who are\nnot treated correctly both with drugs\nand behavioral treatments because really\nthe combination of drugs and behavioral\ntreatments is the optimal situation\nso kids with ADHD who are not treated\nwith drugs and behavioral treatments to\ndeal with their ADHD have a much higher\ntendency towards illicit drug use and\naddictive drug potential in their\nadulthood okay so there is a real danger\nto not treating ADHD during childhood\nand the reverse is also true which is\nthat children with ADHD who take\nprescription drugs that are\nsympathomimetics so yes as you've heard\nthey are speed amphetamine is speed\nalthough I should say if they take\nMethylphenidate\nritalin or Concerta or something of that\nsort that's not amphetamine nonetheless\nit's a stimulant it's a sympathometic\nalso\nthese are kids that are taking these\ndrugs during development and therefore\nlevels of dopamine levels of\nnorepinephrine are being increased in\ntheir brain and body and you might say\nwell wouldn't that lead to a craving for\nthese things later in life and that does\nnot appear to be the case in fact\nthere's some very nice neuroimaging\nstudies mainly positron emission\ntomography studies that I'll provide a\nlink to in the show note captions that\nshow the early treatment with these\ndrugs actually leads to\ncombinations of increased dopamine\nTransmission in the forebrain later in\nlife at a lower level or a lower\nthreshold I should say in a way that\nessentially says there's normalization\nof the circuits Across Time by the\napplication of these drugs early in life\nagain\nin the case of children that have\ndiagnosed ADHD I in no way shape or form\nwant to imply that all children should\nbe treated with these drugs is quite\nclearly not going to be a good idea so\nall of this really speaks to the\ncritical importance of getting an\naccurate diagnosis of ADHD you know\ndiagnostic criteria include many things\nin children there are multiple there are\nmore than nine diagnostic criteria for\neach of the categories relating to\nimpulsivity hyperactivity and so on so a\nwell-qualified psychiatrist will do\nseveral things they will first of all do\na careful diagnostic evaluation of a\nchild and in addition one would hope\nthat they would think about prescribing\nboth appropriate pharmacologic\ntreatments for ADHD but also be aware of\nand prescribe the various other types of\nprescriptions meaning behavioral\nprescriptions so there are clearly\ncertain learning tools and things that\nkids can do in order to improve their\nability to focus and to be less\nimpulsive that combine especially well\nwith drug treatments as well as new\nadvancements in the realm of nutrition\nand supplementation that are constantly\ncoming online and the best psychiatrists\nare going to be tuned into all of those\naspects of treatment for ADHD not just\nprescription drugs but also behavioral\ntreatments also nutritional guidelines\nalso supplementation and also updating\neach and all of those things as a child\nmatures from each stage of development\nto the next I'd like to take a quick\nbreak and thank our sponsor inside\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nassessed with a quality blood test the\nproblem with a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there however is that they'll\ngive you information about certain lipid\nmarkers or hormone markers but no\ninformation about what to do with all\nall of that data inside tracker makes it\nvery easy to look at your levels of\nhormones metabolic factors lipids Etc\nand then to assess what sorts of\nBehavioral nutritional supplementation\nor perhaps other interventions you might\nwant to use in order to bring those\nnumbers into the ranges that are optimal\nfor your health inside tracker's\nultimate plan now includes three new\nhormone markers that are critical to\nmeasure during a woman's reproductive\nand menopausal years these are estradiol\nprogesterone and thyroid stimulating\nhormone if you'd like to try inside\ntracker you can go to insidetracker.com\nhuberman to get 20 off any of inside\ntracker's plans again that's inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off now\nthe other common question is if a child\nhas been treated with these ADHD meds\nduring development do they need to\ncontinue on those drugs indefinitely and\nthe short answer to this is it depends\nand that can be a somewhat frustrating\nanswer I realize but the good news is\nit's something that can be assessed in a\nfairly straightforward way\nlet's recall that the use of these drugs\nto treat ADHD is designed to accomplish\ntwo things it's designed to improve the\nfunction of those neural circuits that\nallow a child to focus and it's also\ndesigned to increase the strength of\nthose circuits to effectively teach the\ncircuits how to learn what focus is in\nother words these drugs are designed in\nsome cases to be used and then withdrawn\nlater because the circuits that they\nhelped build up are functioning well\nin some cases however the circuits that\nunderlie Focus are not going to be able\nto function at the level required for\nnormal healthy life progression unless\nthere's continued application of the\ndrug so how would this work in the real\nworld context well I think any child or\nadolescent or person younger than 25\nthat's taken these drugs has no doubt\nachieved some level of neuroplasticity\nof the neural circuits related to all\nthe things we call Focus I and I want to\nbe very clear there's no single brain\narea or set of brain circuits for what\nI'm referring to as Focus\nbecause after all Focus involves test\nswitching Focus involves all sorts of\ndifferent cognitive operations depending\non what we're focusing on\nright the focusing on a sport is\nbasically a practice of directing one's\nattention in different locations at\ndifferent moments focusing on studying\nis an entirely different pattern of\nfocus altogether but the point being if\na person 25 years or younger takes a\ndrug that increases dopamine and\nnorepinephrine and assuming that things\nare working meaning\nthe dose is right they're achieving\nbetter ability to focus etc those\ncircuits are going to get stronger and\nit seems entirely reasonable in fact it\nwas supported by the psychiatrist that I\nspoke to prior to this episode that\npeople who've been on ADHD meds for any\npoint of time prior to 25 talk to their\npsychiatrist about what tapering off\nthose drugs in order to examine whether\nor not they still need those drugs would\nlook like now I mentioned the word taper\nbecause there is a withdrawal potential\nof Simply stopping these drugs very\nquickly because they do ramp up dopamine\nand norepinephrine\neven though they increase plasticity of\nthe neural circuits for focus and mood\nand motivation if one very abruptly\nceases taking any of these drugs\nit does not feel good that drop in\ndopamine that one inevitably experiences\nis almost always associated with\nlethargy with depressed mood with\nfeeling not good in a number of ways and\nof course challenges in Focus so anytime\none is going to go off one of these\ndrugs or sample what it is to even\nreduce dosage that has to be done in\nclose communication with a\nboard-certified psychiatrist at the same\ntime it was made very clear to me from\nADHD expert psychiatrists\nthat reductions in dosage over time\noften are optimal for a patient okay and\nthis gets to the whole issue of dosage\ngenerally you know I spend a good amount\nof time talking to somebody who\nprescribes these drugs both to children\nand adults about dosage ranges and I\ndon't want to spend too much time on\nthis\nfrom the perspective of how much one\nshould take in fact I don't want anyone\nto think that what I'm about to say\nshould dictate what they should take\nspecifically because that's something\nthat really has to be worked out on an\nindividual basis but it is worth noting\nthat if you look at the studies on\nAdderall and Methylphenidate\nbut you'll see it is a pretty broad\nrange\nin those studies and that's because some\nof the studies used people that were\nalready taking these drugs and asked\nthem to participate in neuroimaging\nstudies other studies actually put\npeople on these drugs for the very first\ntime or adjusted their dosage and so\nyou'll see a tremendous range of drug\ndoses explored for instance you will see\nanywhere from 10 to 40 milligrams of\nAdderall per day you'll see anywhere\nfrom 10 to 60 milligrams of Ritalin per\nday and here we could easily be talking\nabout studies on children or adults\nwith respect to Vyvanse you'll see that\nthe dosages tend to be much higher in\npart that's because vivance has if you\nrecall it's that lysine which is a big\nmolecule stuck on D amphetamine which is\na smaller molecule and so the dosages of\nVyvanse tend to be in the hundreds of\nmilligram ranges but most of that 100\nmilligrams of Vyvanse is not going to be\nthe damphetamine it's going to be the\nlysine which doesn't do anything in the\ncontext of treating the brain it's just\nthere to control the slow release so\nit's thought that 100 milligrams of\nVyvanse translates to roughly nine\nmilligrams of Adderall and on and on and\nactually it's pretty hard to translate\nbetween dosages of different drugs in\nany direct way and in speaking with a\npsychiatrist expert in ADHD in\npreparation for this episode he made\nvery clear that it is extremely\nextremely difficult to predict how a\nchild or adult will react to a given\ndosage of any of these drugs so much so\nin fact that he anecdotally reported to\nme that one of his patients is a male 3\n100 pounds diagnosed with ADHD and who\nachieves tremendous relief from just 2.5\nmilligrams of Adderall per day\nand at the same time he has two patients\nboth of whom are sisters so they're\ngenetically related who are in the 120\nto 140 pound range who did not respond\nwell at all for the treatment of their\nADHD until their dosages were very very\nhigh and if I tell you these dosages I\njust want to warn you in advance I'm not\nsuggesting anyone explore these dosages\nwithout of course the approval of their\npsychiatrist turns out that neither of\nthese two young women responded at all\nto ADHD medication until they achieved\ndosages in the range of 180 in the case\nof one sister and 240 milligrams in the\ncase of the other sister per day which\nis an astronomically high dose on the\nface of it but this physician again\nboard certified physician expert in\nadiation\nverified for me that indeed neither of\nthem experience any discomfort or side\neffects that led them to not want to\ntake the drug\nbut of course that amount of Adderall\ncould send somebody else into an\nabsolute psychotic fit could potentially\neven cause cardiac arrest I mean it's\nremarkable the ranges of Adderall that\nare used effectively in children and\nadults and this is true for a lot of the\nother sympathomimetics used to treat\nADHD and of course a good psychiatrist\nwill always assess\ndosage as it relates to positive\nbenefits you know relief of symptoms so\nrelief of impulsivity relief of\nhyperactivity improvements and ability\nto focus\nand of course they they are going to\nconsider side effects any uncomfortable\nadverse effects that come from taking\nthe drug at a given dosage or taking the\ndrug at all now of course this all begs\nthe question of why such tremendous\nvariation is this due to genetic\ndifferences in the amount of dopamine or\nnorepinephrine that people make it\nappears that the major\nunderlying factor for why people require\nsuch vastly different dosages of these\nsympathomimetics for the relief of ADHD\nhas to do with the different enzymes or\nlevels of enzymes that people make which\nmetabolize these drugs both in the brain\nand body and unfortunately there is no\nsimple blood test or saliva test or test\nof any kind that can predict how someone\nwill respond to these drugs so the most\nlogical and safe way to assess dosage is\nto start with the lowest possible\neffective dose and to increase only as\nnecessary in order to achieve the\npositive benefits while of course paying\nattention to any side effects that might\narise a question that comes up from time\nto time when discussing the long-term\neffects of drugs like Adderall Ritalin\nand vivance is whether or not they can\nnegatively impact height or growth or\ndevelopment in some other way this is a\nlogical question to ask because after\nall these drugs are effectively\nmimicking stress in the body and most\neveryone is heard by now that while\nstress can help us in the short term it\nhelps us deploy immune molecules to\nprotect us against infection and it\nsharpens our visual focus and our\nability to respond to things for\nsurvival\nchronically elevating our stress over\nlong periods of time we know reduces the\neffectiveness of our immune system and\ncan actually cause certain forms of\nbrain degeneration and while there\naren't a lot of longitudinal studies on\nthe heights of kids with ADHD and of\ncourse we never can tell how tall\nsomeone would have grown to be if they\nwere treated with a drug because we\ndon't have a perfect control experiment\neven in the case of identical twin\nexperiments and therein there aren't\nthat many of those examples where one\ntwin was treated for ADHD and the other\nwasn't Etc but here's what we know it\ndoes not appear that treatment with\nsympathomimetics during development\nprovided that dosages are kept in the\nappropriate ranges\nis going to limit overall height in fact\nif you look at the data it appears that\nchildren with ADHD who are treated with\nADHD meds actually arrive at slightly\nhigher bmis body mass indexes compared\nto age-matched peers now of course body\nmass index doesn't necessarily correlate\nwith height right someone could not\nachieve a full height but could be\nheavier either through bone or fat or\nmuscle or combination of all three but\nwhat we know is that the appropriate use\nof ADHD meds during development is not\nstunting development in any kind of\noverall way it's not preventing\nmaturation of the body in ways that are\nleading to reduced weight or somehow\nimpaired growth overall with that said\nlong-term elevations of sympathetic\nnervous system activity does carry some\nrisk and one of the primary risks that\npeople have wondered about is\ncardiovascular risk this makes perfect\nsense right when you increase the\nactivity of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem you increase blood pressure to\nincrease heart rate you increase in some\ncases peripheral sweating you know all\nthe things that we associate with stress\nso you can imagine that a child or adult\nwith ADHD that takes these\nsympathomimetics every day even if the\ndosage is kept in a Range that doesn't\nallow them to experience any immediate\nuntoward side effects so they're not\nfeeling miserable they're just feeling\nlike they can focus better but one\nalways wonders what's going on under the\nhood so to speak\nthere is as far as I know one major\nstudy that's addressed this and the\nconclusions of that study were a little\nbit hard to put into a single category\nit did point to a subtle increase in\ncardiovascular risk\nbut the results did not point to\nanything so dramatic that the authors of\nthe study warned against taking these\ndrugs or encouraging people to cease\ntaking these drugs again provided\nthey're being prescribed by a\nboard-certified physician for ADHD and\nat the appropriate dosage for that\nperson that said I think this all again\nspeaks to the importance of arriving at\nminimal effective dosage and it stands\nto reason that if you're somebody who's\ntaking ADHD meds or if your child is\ntaking ADHD meds that one would want to\ndo all the other things that they could\ndo in order to try and improve\ncardiovascular health or at least not\nput it at additional risk so those are\ngoing to be the obvious things like\navoiding smoking or vaping nicotine\nregular exercise is going to be\nencouraged and things of that sort and\nthat dovetails into a bunch of other\nquestions that are often asked anytime\nthe topic of Adderall or Ritalin comes\nup which is what about alcohol you know\nis drinking alcohol the same time or at\ndifferent times even going to be\nproblematic if one is taking these drugs\nis taking benzodiazepines going to be a\nproblem etc etc\nthere's a very straightforward answer to\nthis which is it's very clear that\nalcohol certainly in children but also\nin adults is best not consumed I did an\nentire episode about alcohol\nwhich got into this and the data for\nthis if you've heard that having some\nalcohol in particular red wine is better\nfor you than know alcohol that is simply\nnot true sorry it's not true most adults\nwho are not alcoholics can probably have\nup to two that's right two drinks per\nweek and still be on the safe side of\nHealth although zero is better than two\nand once you get past two you start\nseeing effects on various systems\nincluding increased cancer risk\nespecially brain\nneuron loss and degeneration risk I\ncovered all of those data in the episode\non alcohol that you can find at\nhubermanlab.com\ncombining alcohol with sympathomimetics\neven though they reside in very\ndifferent Pathways within the brain in\nfact the sympathomimetics are driving up\nsympathetic nervous system activity\nwhereas alcohol is actually doing the\nopposite it's depressing it and yet all\nthe data points to the fact that\ncombining alcohol with sympathomimetics\nsuch as Vyvanse Adderall ritalin or any\nkind of amphetamine is going to be more\ndetrimental to the brain and body than\nsimply taking those drugs on their own\nput differently and more directly if you\nare taking any of the drugs that we've\nbeen talking about to treat ADHD or if\nyou just happen to be taking them for\nwhatever reason you are going to want to\navoid drinking alcohol at any time and\nyou're going to want to avoid\nbenzodiazepines and similar unless\nthey've been prescribed to you by your\nphysician in advance of this episode I\nput a call out on social media for\nquestions about Adderall Etc and I got a\nlot of questions about whether or not\ntheir impacts of these drugs on the\nhormone systems of the body and if they\nimpact the reproductive system in\nparticular I also got questions about\nwhether or not these drugs impact sexual\nbehavior or libido or anything of that\nsort in reviewing the literature what I\ncan tell you is that there are very few\nstudies unfortunately of the long-term\neffects of these drugs on the endocrine\nor hormone systems of the body\nbut we do know a few things for sure\nfirst of all when you increase the\nactivity of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem for long periods of time you are\nvery likely increasing levels of\ncortisol cortisol is a quote unquote\nstress hormone but cortisol also plays\nsome really important positive roles in\nyour body in fact if you want cortisol\nreleased especially early in the day you\ndon't want cortisol released so much\nlate in the day this actually relates\nback to timing and schedules of taking\ndrugs this is something again that needs\nto be worked out with your psychiatrist\nor your child's psychiatrist but one of\nthe reasons why there are so many\ndifferent drugs for the treatment of\nADHD is that each and all of them has a\ndifferent time course of action so\nRitalin is very short-lived which might\nsound bad because then you have to take\nit multiple times throughout the day but\nif you think about from the perspective\nof sleep and the importance of having\nlow cortisol at night and these drugs\nincrease cortisol and the importance of\ngetting sleep because after all sleep is\nthe foundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance in kids and\nadults it's responsible for growth it's\nwhen neuroplasticity happens it's just\nso vitally important\na lot of the drugs that we've been\ntalking about can severely limit one's\nability to fall and stay asleep and so a\nshort-acting drug like Ritalin is\nactually attractive from the perspective\nof being able to take it in the morning\nand still get to sleep at night or\ntaking it in the morning and in the\nafternoon and maybe even again in the\nevening depending on the person\nand then still being able to fall asleep\nat night\nwhereas long duration release of D\namphetamine which is what you get when\nyou take Vyvanse\nfor some people is going to inhibit\ntheir sleep they'll get a nice steady\nrise and Improvement in focus and\nreduction in hyperactivity but they\nmight have a lot of trouble falling\nasleep at night and Adderall having a\nsomewhat intermediate time course of\naction between ritalin which is\nshort-lived and Vyvanse which is very\nlong-lived\nperhaps is going to be the best solution\nfor somebody else where they can take it\nearly in the day perhaps at a low dose\nmaybe again later in the day low dose\nand then still fall asleep at night but\nI've spoken to people and I've spoke to\nthis clinician expert in ADHD who told\nme that some people will take as little\nas 2.5 milligrams of Adderall at 6 00 am\nand have a hard time falling asleep\nlater that night at 11 PM so again\nvastly different sensitivities to these\ndrugs leading to vastly different\nrequirements of dosage and timing of\nintake and which particular drug\nsomebody might choose to or choose not\nto take so how does that relate to\nhormones and sex and reproduction well\ncortisol itself is a hormone it can act\nas a bit of a hormone and a\nneurotransmitter in the brain but for\nthe most part it's acting as a hormone\nin the brain and body and it does a\nnumber of things first of all it can\nenhance your levels of focus and\nalertness it can activate your immune\nsystem I know that immunologists out\nthere just cringe when I say activate\nthe immune system your immune system is\nalways doing various things so it's\nalways active just as your nervous\nsystem is always active but it can\nto be specific it can amplify or\nmobilize the release of\nanti-inflammatory molecules in your\nbrain and body to combat different types\nof bacterial viral and fungal infections\nit's doing an enormous number of\npositive things it's also involved in\nsetting mood it has interactions with\nthyroid hormone pathways\nI've done entire episodes about cortisol\nand cortisol regulation\nto paint all of that with a very broad\nbrush and briefly now it's advantageous\nto have your cortisol release high in\nthe early part of the day and to taper\noff toward the end of the day in fact\nlate day elevations in cortisol are a\nstrong correlate of depressive symptoms\nthis was demonstrated by my colleagues\nDavid Spiegel and Robert sapolsky at\nStanford School of Medicine\nbut that is not to say that cortisol is\nbad it's to say that the timing of\ncortisol release is key so do these\nsympathomimetic drugs\ndisrupt the endocrine system well they\ncan if you are very awake and very alert\nregardless of whether or not you're\ntaking your sympathomimetic treatment\nfor ADHD early in the day or late in the\nday you are very likely experiencing\nelevations in cortisol late in the day\nso it is important even for those of you\nthat like to study and need to focus in\nthe evening and nighttime hours that you\ntry and limit your levels of overall\nalertness and certainly stress late in\nthe day because doing that day after day\nafter day for several weeks or months or\nyears can indeed disrupt other hormones\nin the endocrine system and again that's\nbecause cortisol is interacting with\nthyroid hormone and testosterone and\nestrogen in fact cortisol in many ways\ncompetes with or can out-compete for the\nproduction of testosterone and other\nso-called steroid hormones remember\ncortisol itself is a corticosteroid\nhormone\nso when we hear the word steroids\noftentimes people just think about\nathletes and steroid abuse in sports but\nsteroid hormones includes a lot of\ndifferent types of hormones which are\ngood for us our endogenous steroid\nhormones are vital for all sorts of\nthings Vitality reproduction Etc\nand\nthe way this works in general terms is\nthat the cholesterol molecule is used to\ncreate testosterone and cortisol and\nestrogen\nif we make too much cortisol we in many\nways are reducing the total amount of\ntestosterone that we make or that is\nactive it's not\nexactly that straightforward but we can\nmake that statement with uh with\nconfidence for instance if you spike\nyour cortisol just briefly during the\nday because you have some sort of\nstressful event that's not going to\ninhibit your testosterone in fact it\nprobably is going to boost your\ntestosterone levels somewhat however if\nyour cortisol levels are chronically\nelevated yes indeed it's likely that\nyou're going to suppress your total and\nor free Unbound forms of testosterone\nand downstream to that you will\nexperience effects such as reductions in\nlibido reductions in muscle and bone\nmass reductions in all sorts of aspects\nof testosterone related psychology and\nbodily biology this is true for both\nmales and females and the same thing\ncould be said for estrogen now what's\nimpossible for us to say is whether or\nnot taking a given treatment for ADHD is\ngoing to for instance prevent a woman\nfrom ovulating that could happen through\nchronic elevations and cortisol but\nthere's no direct link meaning there are\nno studies at least that I'm aware of\nshowing that people that take Adderall\nhave irregular ovulatory Cycles or that\nthey cease menstruating entirely I don't\nthink there's any evidence for that\nwhatsoever nor is there any evidence\nthat people that take Adderall or other\nsympathomimetics for the treatment of\nADHD have lower overall testosterone in\nfact you can imagine all sorts of\ninstances in which the opposite was true\nthat a child or young adult or adult who\nhas ADHD but then goes on these meds to\nimprove their symptoms is now focusing\nand achieving more in life we know that\nhappiness can impact dopamine and vice\nversa and testosterone levels and\nproductivity itself and reaching our\ngoals can feedback on the hormone system\nso anytime there's a discussion about\nhormones or a study that shows that\ndoing X or not doing why impacts hormone\nlevels of a given type we have to be\nvery careful to make sure that we're\ntalking about causality because all of\nthese hormones are in a very intricate\ncrosstalk with one another we can\nhowever make a very general statement\nwhich is that when you are in states of\nstress for long periods of time that is\nnot a favorable condition addition for\nyour immune system your hormone system\nor frankly any other system in the brain\nand body so the treatment of ADHD with\nthese drugs should never be done at the\nexpense of these other critical\nbiological systems another common\nquestion and concern is whether or not\nkids and I suppose for that matter\nadults that take medication for ADHD are\nbasically being predisposed to psychosis\nand or other forms of addiction and\nearlier we talked a bit about the risk\nfor addiction and the take-home message\nthere is very clear that kids and adults\nthat are treated for ADHD appropriately\nso with the appropriate dosage of the\nappropriate drugs under the supervision\nof a board-certified qualified\npsychiatrist or at less risk for forming\naddictions to other substances in\nadulthood or other substances generally\nI think a lot of people also wonder\nwhether or not those kids and those\nadults that take these ADHD meds become\naddicted to the medications themselves\nthat's a bit of a tricky issue to\nresolve anytime one stops taking a drug\nor even tapers off a drug that's used to\ntreat something where they feel better\non the drug they're going to experience\ntwo sets of effects and these two sets\nof effects are often confounded with one\nanother one is the withdrawal effects so\nthe effects of removing the drug that\nmakes somebody feel less good than\nBaseline so for instance a kid that\ntakes ADHD meds until their late teens\nor early 20s decides they're going to\ntaper off they do that and they're\nfeeling lousy during the taper or when\nthey reduce their dosage to zero they're\nyou know foggy brain they can't focus\nthey feel a little bit depressed mood it\nunclear whether or not those are\nwithdrawal symptoms or whether or not\nthose are the consequence of not having\nthe systems in their brain activated the\nway that those systems were activated\nbefore I realize that for some of you\nthat might seem like the same thing but\nthat's not necessarily the same thing\nand probably the best analogy would be\nsomething along the lines of a hangover\nright if somebody drinks too much on a\ngiven night the next morning they have a\nhangover The Hangover makes them feel\nlousy it's it is actually a withdrawal\nfrom alcohol effect but then when they\nrecover from The Hangover they realize\nthat their sober State feels pretty good\nit doesn't obviously feel the same as\nbeing on alcohol but that sober state is\nnot a state of withdrawal okay if we\nwere to look at removal or tapering off\nof ADHD meds there's going to be a\nperiod of withdrawal symptoms but then\nthe real question is how does somebody\nfeel after they get through those\nwithdrawal symptoms so that's an\nimportant issue to highlight now in\nterms of psychosis this is a very\ninteresting and very important\nliterature sure first of all any\namphetamine whether or not it's D\namphetamine L amphetamine and also\nmethylphenidate for that matter Ritalin\ncan induce psychosis now there are a\nnumber of different factors that are\ngoing to predispose somebody to\npsychosis having a first relative who's\nhad psychotic episodes either\nschizophrenic episodes or bipolar\nepisodes is certainly a strong\npredisposition\nof course if an individual themselves\nhave had psychotic episodes that's the\nstrongest predisposition that one could\nimagine so having a first relative with\nschizophrenia or with bipolar depression\nor sometimes called bipolar disorder\nsometimes it's also just called bipolar\nthese days is going to be a strong\npredisposition for psychotic episodes\nmade much greater\nanytime one takes a sympathomimetic drug\nsuch as amphetamine but also\nmethylphenidate Ritalin is going to\nincrease that likelihood of psychotic\nepisodes then comes the question of if\nsomebody has a psychotic episode as the\nconsequence of taking any of these drugs\nwhether or not it's been prescribed for\nADHD or not will those psychotic\nsymptoms go away after the person stops\ntaking the drug there appears to be a\ndivide in the literature or rather a\ndivide according to drug such that\npeople that take Ritalin methylphenidate\nand have a psychotic episode often not\nalways but most often if they stop\ntaking methylphenidate The Psychotic\nepisode will cease\nnot always the case but most often times\nit will cease whereas in individuals who\nhave a predisposition to psychosis or\neven if they're not aware of a\npredisposition of psychosis and they\ntake Adderall which as you recall is a\ncombination of D and L amphetamine\nthey can have psychotic episodes that\nsometimes are very long lasting even\nafter the cessation of the drug and\nwhile that might sound kind of shocking\nand really scary and indeed it is scary\nit perhaps shouldn't shock us that much\nbecause if you recall D amphetamine\nwhich there's a lot of in Adderall it's\na very potent way of increasing dopamine\nand anytime you potently increase\ndopamine in a person who has a\npredisposition to psychotic episodes you\nare shifting the whole system toward a\ngreater propensity for psychosis this\nwould also be the appropriate time to\ntalk about meth methamphetamine\nagain methamphetamine is considered an\nillicit drug a drug of abuse it is\nresponsible for a lot of The Misfortune\nand tragedy that you see on the streets\nof major cities and even outside of\nmajor cities and rural areas it has all\nsorts of negative effects on health\nincluding oral health cardiovascular\nhealth it is neurotoxic to serotonergic\nneuron so it kills serotonin neurons\nthat is absolutely clear it kills\ndopaminergic neurons that is absolutely\nclear one of the ways that\nmethamphetamine creates so many of the\nproblems that it does eating effects on\nthe body abuse potential addictive\npotential\nthe fact that methamphetamine can spark\npsychosis in those that have a\npredisposition to psychosis but also\nthat it can create psychosis in\nindividuals who have no predisposition\nto psychosis right all of this points to\nmethamphetamine just being a terrible\ndrug all around and yet if you recall\nback to the beginning of the episode\nthere is one form of prescription\nmethamphetamine but its uses are\nextremely narrow and it's probably best\nleft out of this conversation because\nits uses are so so narrow in the\nclinical sense I managed to talk to One\nexpert this is a board-certified\npsychiatrist who's expert in ADHD who is\nalso very familiar with the psychosis\nsymptoms induced by methamphetamine and\nby various ADHD drugs and people who\nhave the predisposition they made it\nvery clear that any of the sympathom and\nmedic ADHD drugs that are of the\namphetamine variety so that would be\nAdderall and extended release Adderall\nit'll be Pure dexedrine or any variants\nthat include amphetamine are going to\nhave higher likelihood of inducing\npsychosis and people that have a\npredisposition of psychosis and yet they\ndid assure me that at appropriately\nprescribed and safe dosages that the\ntotal incidence of psychosis in people\nthat take those drugs is still fairly\nlow and not that much greater than in\nthe general population although there is\nan increased risk it's not that severe\nand they also highlighted the fact that\nmethylphenidate Ritalin carries a lower\npotential for inducing psychosis not\nzero but a lower level of inducing\npsychosis then for the amphetamine type\nsympathomimetics now one exception is a\nVyvanse that long release damphetamine\nthat we talked about earlier there does\nseem to be some things protective about\nthat long duration release of\ndamphetamine that occurs with Vyvanse\nwhich is not to say that there's zero\nabuse or addictive potential with\nVyvanse\num I was told by the same individual\nthat indeed they've had knowledge of\npatients trying to increase the rate of\nabsorption of Vyvanse and release of\nVyvanse or technically of the\ndamphetamine in order to get more of a\nhigh from Vyvanse as opposed to just the\nextended release but they did assure me\nhowever that Vivant seems to be\nassociated with fewer psychotic episodes\nand less abuse and addictive potential\noverall which again is not to say that\nit's a perfectly safe drug but really\nthis just highlights the fact that the\nkinetics or the time course of dopamine\nand norepinephrine release that's caused\nby a given drug is going to correlate\nvery strongly with its abuse potential\nand addictive potential and its\npotential to induce psychotic episodes\nand this is where the discussion about\nmeth becomes especially relevant one of\nthe reasons why meth is so dangerous in\nterms of its addictive potential and its\npotential to induce psychotic episodes\nis first of all how much dopamine it\nreleases again five times more than any\nof the other drugs that we've been\ntalking about but also how fat past that\nPeak comes on it's a very fast onset and\nthat's true whether or not people are\nsnorting it without their taking it\norally or especially if they inject it\nintravenously\nbut meth because it increases dopamine\nso fast into such a great degree and\nthen the the peak in dopamine comes down\nvery fast as well and it drops below the\nBaseline levels of dopamine that were\npresent initially that's one of the\nreasons why methamphetamine is so\ndangerous in terms of addiction and in\nterms of psychotic episodes this gets\nback to a bunch of issues we've talked\nabout before on the huberman Lab podcast\nabout dopamine kinetics and I've done\ntwo episodes on dopamine that I'll refer\nyou to one is called dopamine motivation\nand drive which is all about dopamine\nand regulating dopamine and the other\none is about optimizing dopamine it's\nmore of a toolkit focused episode both\nthose you can find at hubermanlab.com\nbut the general takeaway that's relevant\nfor what we're talking about now is that\nwith dopamine it's not just about the\nabsolute levels of dopamine that are\nreached but how long lasting those\nincreases in dopamine are so with\nvivance even though vivance is\ndamphetamine it's fairly potent not as\nimpotent as meth but fairly potent at\nincreasing dopamine and norepinephrine\nit's a long extended release in dopamine\nand norepinephrine which reduces its\noverall abuse potential because it\ndoesn't tend to create that immediate\nEuphoria and high and then crash below\nBaseline\na lot of you will hear that it increases\ndopamine a lot and then stays up as\ntranslating to okay well then you're\njust euphoric for 16 hours but that's\nnot the case when it comes to dopamine\nit's an issue of How High that Peak is\nand whether or not that Peak is stable\nor whether or not it comes down again\nand when it comes to psychotic episodes\nor addictive potential it seems that any\ndrug or behavior that increases dopamine\nvery quickly and then brings dopamine\ndown very quickly is what sets the high\npotential for addiction and abuse and\nfor inducing psychotic episodes so\nthat's why I'm talking about these two\nthings in parallel and now it should be\nvery clear why vyvance doesn't have so\nmuch addictive and abuse potential and\nhas at least lower potential for\ninducing psychotic episodes and it\nshould also be clear to you\nthat for people who do not have ADHD as\na child or for people that do not have\nADHD in adulthood if they were to take\nany truly any of the compounds that\nwe're talking about thus far\nmethylphenidate Ritalin Adderall vivance\ndexedrine and certainly methamphetamine\nwhat we observe from neuroimaging\nstudies is that these people get\nenormous increases in dopamine they're\nnot familiar with these drugs so the\nincreases in dopamine are just Cosmic\nfor them they experience a lot of\neuphoria even if the dosages are low the\nEuphoria is associated with a very\nheightened degree of focus they've never\nreally felt before here what I'm talking\nabout is a lot of the recreational and\noff prescription use of Adderall and\nthings like it and what we know is that\nthat sets in motion both a potential for\nabuse and addiction to that feeling and\nsubstance as well as a higher potential\nfor psycho episodes down the road okay\nso put differently children who have\nADHD and are prescribed any of these\ndrugs\nor adults who have ADHD and are\nprescribed any of these drugs who take\nthem for some period of time are\nactually at lesser risk to all of the\nissues related to having chronically\nelevated and greatly elevated dopamine\nas a kind of first time event or as a\nrare event whereas anyone who takes\nthese drugs without a prescription and\ndecides okay I want to focus more or I'm\ngoing to use this to stay up for a\ncouple of days\nin other words using it recreationally\nor using it for quote-unquote\nperformance enhancement is that far\ngreater risk for addiction to these\nsubstances because of the amplitude and\nthe time course of dopamine that results\nwhen one takes these drugs just out of\nthe blue and so for that reason I really\nwant to caution everybody against using\nany of the compounds that I've discussed\nthus far unless it's been prescribed to\nyou by a physician for the specific\npurpose of ADHD now I'm sure someone out\nthere is screaming from the back wait\nif a kid takes these drugs because\nthey're prescribed them for ADHD the\nvery first time they take them they're\ngoing to have a huge amplitude dopamine\nresponse or if an adult goes in and\ntalks to their psychiatrist and says you\nknow I'm having issues with focusing in\ntheir prescribed one of these meds for\nADHD and they take it they're going to\nhave a huge amplitude dopamine response\nisn't that going to set in motion all\nthe same things that somebody who is\nusing these drugs recreationally would\nhave and indeed that's one of the\nreasons why a lot of psychiatrists will\nstart with a very low dosage or the\nlowest possible dosage to see how\nsomebody responds to that low dosage and\nthen over time might or might not\nincrease that dosage in fact they might\neven bring it down further depending on\nhow sensitive somebody is to the drug\nbut equally important is the fact that\nit is the repeated taking of that drug\nby the child with ADHD or by the adult\nwith ADHD that actually leads to lesser\nand lesser peaks in dopamine each time\nwhich is not to say that the person\nbecomes entirely desensitized to the\neffects of the drug but rather that the\nsystem equilibrates through what's\ncalled homeostatic plasticity sometimes\nreferred to broadly as habituation to a\ndrug but there are systems in the brain\nand body that regulate the connections\nbetween neurons so that if dopamine and\nnorepinephrine are elevated above\nBaseline levels for a while the system\nnormalizes so that instead the\nconnections between neurons become\nstronger and there isn't the critical\nrequirement for all that increase in\ndopamine and norepinephrine I realize\nthat might sound a little bit technical\nbut basically what I'm saying is the\nresponse that somebody has to taking a\ndrug for the first time is Far and Away\ndifferent than the response to a drug\nthat somebody has if they are taking the\nsame drug day after day after day this\ngets to another issue which is not\ndiscussed that often these days but that\nis really important if you go back to\nthe original clinical literature on the\nsympathomimetics what you'll find is\nthat\nthe original use of these\nsympathomimetics to treat childhood ADHD\nsuggested that children not take these\ndrugs every single day now I'm not\nrecommending that kids take drug\nholidays because I'm not a clinician I'm\nnot promoting any specific dose or\ndosing regimen but in speaking again to\na psychiatrist expert in ADHD who by the\nway is going to be a guest on this\npodcast in the not too distant future\nwhat he told me was that many of these\ndrugs were designed to be taken during\nthe school week for children with\nweekends off or during the school year\nwith weekends off but then also with\nvacations during the summer holidays and\nthat these days rarely if ever is that\nthe pattern of intake that these kids\nare following and why that is has\ninteresting sociological and financial\nexplanations\nI'm not alluding to any kind of\nconspiracy here but this is an aspect of\nthe dosing with these drugs that has\nsort of Fallen away in recent years but\nI think is really interesting and it's\nsomething that actually was supported\nfor the treatment of adult ADHD as well\nagain there is a very different\nbiological and neuroplastic response to\ntaking a drug once versus taking a drug\nfor say five days and then taking\nweekends off to taking a drug\nover and over again every single day for\na pattern of years and when exploring\nthe literature and preparation for this\nepisode I confess it was a bit dizzying\nto find answers to what are the\nlong-term effects of taking Adderall or\nwhat are the long-term effects of taking\nVyvanse Etc in fact most of the\nliterature on the long-term effects of\ntaking drugs to treat ADHD has focus on\nmethylphenidate on Ritalin there are\nstudies on Vyvanse and adderall and\nactually those were the studies that I\nwill link in the show note captions\nprimarily because that's where most of\nthe interest is these days the reason\nwhy so many of the Studies have focused\non methylphenidate on Ritalin is largely\nbecause that was one of the first drugs\nused to treat ADHD so in terms of\naddressing long-term effects so kids\ntreated with ADHD meds those kids are\nnow adults and therefore can be\nneuroimaged and assessed whereas a lot\nof kids that have been prescribed\nAdderall or Vyvanse or similar have not\nyet made it to stages of life in which\nwe can answer that question directly\nthere are a few studies and I've made it\nclear to include those studies in my\ndescription of results today in\nparticular the result I talked about\nearlier where there's an improvement in\nexecutive function in kids that have\ntaken ADHD meds or adults that have\ntaken ADHD meds for a longer period of\ntime anywhere from months to years those\nstudies did include both Adderall and\nVyvanse and methylphenidate and again\nI'll link to those studies but by and\nlarge most of what we know about the\nlong-term effects of any of these drugs\nhas to do primarily with studies of\nmethylphenidate I'd like to spend a\nlittle bit of time talking about some\ncompounds that are not considered\namphetamines at all but that are now\nbeing used to treat ADHD both in\nchildren and adults more frequently the\nmajor drug in this category of\nnon-amphetamine treatments for ADHD is\nmodafinil which is also called by its\ncommercial name Provigil\nthere's a variance on this which is our\nmodafinil which goes by the brand name\nNuvigil the major difference between\nmodafinil and arm modafinil aside from\nhaving a slight chemical difference is\nthat modafinil was released first our\nmodafinil is the second in the\ngeneration of these drugs\nand modafinil tends to be very expensive\nthat's one of the reasons why it's\nprohibitive for some people to take it\ncan be as expensive as 25 a pill or more\nto more than a thousand dollars per\nmonth\nand our modafinil tends to be far far\nless expensive I've talked to a couple\nexperts about whether or not there are\nany genuine differences between these\ntwo drugs and they report no although\nconsumers of these drugs for whatever\nreason whether or not it's Placebo or\nnot report yes there is a different when\nI say Placebo I in no way mean that\nthese drugs are just acting as Placebo I\njust mean that you know people tend to\nget very attached to certain drugs and\nwhether or not the brand name or the\ngeneric version works better for them\nthere's all sorts of lore about this in\nfact there are a lot of people out there\nwho strongly feel that brand name\nAdderall works better than generic\nAdderall for them\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nsay the same thing about vivance there\nare a lot of people out there who say\nthe same thing about Ritalin and all\nsorts of drugs whether or not that's\ntrue or not is unclear\nit is clear that generic versions of\ndrugs can use binders and other things\nthat are in the pill or capsule that are\ndifferent than what the brand name\npillar capsule uses as binders to hold\nthe drug together and that can impact\nrates of release and Metabolism Etc but\na lot of this is just Laura in fact I\nwent into the literature to try and find\nany\nreal concrete support for the idea that\ngeneric adderall is less potent or less\neffective than brand name Adderall and\ndespite the tens of thousands of people\nwho will say to the contrary I could not\nfind any peer-reviewed published data\nabout that so who knows maybe it's a\nbelief effect as it's called maybe\nthere's a real difference there nowadays\nmodafinil and armodafinil are prescribed\nfor a huge range of daytime sleepiness\nissues and we were talking about\nnarcolepsy but there are also people who\nsuffer from daytime sleepiness related\nto dementia daytime sleepiness related\nto post surgery anesthesia so there's\nthis thing where people have surgery and\nthen they come out of surgery and they\nfeel better for a few days but then they\nfind that they aren't recovering their\nnormal levels of wakefulness so it's\nprescribed sometimes to try and get\npeople back into a normal state of\nwakefulness it's been prescribed for a\ntraumatic head injury after stroke again\nall of these prescribed uses have to be\ncarried out by a certified physician you\nreally don't want to start cowboying the\nuse of modafinil or modafinil or any\nother prescription drug for that matter\nI must say that in discussing all these\ndifferent drugs during today's episode I\nhave zero knowledge of any of these\ndrugs from a first-hand experience\nexcept for our modafinil back in 2017 I\nwas prescribed a very very low dose of\narmodafinil for jet lag for daytime\nsleepiness issues really when I was\ntraveling overseas to give a talk so our\nmodafinil was given to me in a 25\nmilligram tablet it was advised to me\nthat I take a half or even a quarter of\nthat so I started with a quarter I am a\nbeliever in minimal effective dose I'm\nalso somebody who's fairly\nhypersensitive to most medication so I\ntook what I measured out to be five to\nseven milligrams of our modafinil and\nwhat I experienced was pretty profound\ncertainly it relieved any daytime\nsleepiness in fact it made me feel\nextremely alert for a period of about\nfour to six hours I can't say it was the\nmost comfortable State although I did\nnot feel as if I had racing heart or\nanything of that sort I basically felt\nas if I was in a narrow tunnel of\nattention for that entire period one\nthing I did not like about the\nexperience is that it was a very hard\nexperience to come down from there was\nno crash but I found that that high\narousal State didn't taper off for many\nhours later even though it was most\nheightened for four hours I would say\nanywhere from 8 to 12 hours later I\nstill felt like I was you know blinking\nonce every four minutes or so and I've\ncertainly been accused on this this\npodcast and at other times of blinking\nto seldom to my knowledge I don't have\nADHD I've never been prescribed ADHD\nmeds I've never been tested for ADHD I\ndon't think I have ADHD and yet taking\nour modafinil certainly increased my\nlevels of attention but at least by that\none experience it's not something that I\nwould want to repeat again I certainly\nwould not want to be in that state for\nlearning new material when I sit down to\nresearch a podcast or research papers in\nmy lab or forage for information or\nlearn from people or books or lectures\nor podcasts I want to be in a state of\nalertness but calm where I can really\nconsider the ideas where I can script\nthings out by hand I'm a big believer in\nwriting things out by hand to remember\nthem later drawing little diagrams I\nwould not want to be in the state that\neven that very low dose of our modafinil\nput me in in order to learn and I should\nmention that both modafinil and\narmodafinil are associated with a good\nnumber of side effects if they don't\nagree with you or if the dosage is too\nhigh things like decreased appetite\npeople get a run nose headache there's\nthis instance of skin rashes in fact one\nof the reasons why modafinil and arm\nmodafinil aren't more broadly prescribed\nis that there's a very rare skin\ncondition in which people who have taken\ncertain drugs not just modafin or arm\nmodafinil have developed these very\nsevere\nburn type blisters and in some cases\nthis can be fatal this is again very\nrare and it was observed in at least one\npatient who took modafinil as part of a\ntrial for modafinil as a treatment for\nADHD it's called Stevens-Johnson\nsyndrome please if you are squeamish to\nimages of skin abrasions and lesions and\nthings of that sort please don't look it\nup on the internet unless you're able to\nhandle that and maybe not at all but the\npoint here is that\none of the reasons that modafinil in our\nmodafinil are not more widely prescribed\nfor ADHD and that it's still only\nprescribed off label\nis that Stephen Johnson syndrome was\nflagged as kind of a potential risk\nalthough the ADHD\nspecialist that I spoke to are somewhat\nfrustrated with that because they insist\nthat the frequency of this syndrome that\ncauses the skin rash that's sometimes\nfatal is no more frequent in those that\ntook modafinil in this trial than with\nother drugs that have been approved so\nthis gets into all sorts of issues\naround what drugs make it to approval\nand which ones don't and as we know\nmodafinil and or modafinil are already\nbeing prescribed in the general\npopulation for other things this was\ndealing specifically with the question\nof whether or not it should be\nprescribed in kids with ADHD and\ncertainly I am a proponent of exerting\nExtreme Caution when thinking about\nwhich drugs should be approved for the\ntreatment of anybody but especially kids\nand to round out our discussion of drugs\nused for the treatment of ADHD that fall\ninto let's call it the atypical category\nright the typical category being\nAdderall Vyvanse methylphenidate and\nthings of that variety the less typical\nwould be modafinil armodafone proprion\nWellbutrin\nand so forth\nthe last in this category of atypical is\nguanfacine guanfacine is an interesting\ncompound it's a compound that was\ndeveloped to lower blood pressure and\nindeed it does lower blood pressure and\nit is an alpha 2A Agonist Alpha 2A being\na receptor for norepinephrine so\nguanfacine is a non-stimulant medication\nto treat ADHD and it's also used to\ntreat some other conditions as well that\nis only working on the noradrenergic\nsystem it is not tapping into the\ndopamine system but all the other stuff\nthat we talked about is really ramping\nup dopamine and norepinephrine\nguanfacine is only increasing\nnorepinephrine and it's doing so by what\nwe say agonizing or stimulating one\nparticular aspect of the noradrenergic\nsystem and that's the alpha 2A system\nwhat's interesting about guanfacine is\nthat it has a bunch of Pathways that it\nactivates that feed back onto the\nautonomic nervous system to dampen down\nthe activation of the sympathetic\nnervous system so whereas most of what\nwe talked about today are\nsympathomimetics they tend to make us\nmore ramped up more aroused and alert\nguanfacine is doing the opposite and as\na consequence it's not prescribed that\noften because a lot of times when people\ntake guanfacine it either has no effect\non ADHD symptoms or it tends to make\npeople feel very sleepy however there's\na small subset of individuals by about\nfive to ten percent of people that try\nit including kids that do get some\nsignificant relief from their ADHD\nsymptoms and they seem to tolerate\nguanfacine better than they're\ntolerating some of the other drugs that\nwe've talked about up until now the way\nguanfacine works is also really\ninteresting you're now familiar with the\nlocus ceruleus this little packet or we\ncall it a nucleus of neurons in the back\nof the brain that release norepine\ndifferent at other sites in the brain\nand they're going to be those Alpha 2A\nreceptors that guanfacine works on and\nstimulates lots of different places in\nthe brain related to increasing salience\nand relevance of particular stimuli that\nwe see and that we need to attend to it\nappears that guanfacine can activate the\nprefrontal cortical networks in ways\nthat are above their normal Baseline so\nthat's good so improvements in executive\nfunction that Orchestra or teacher-like\nfunction we talked about before and can\nincrease the efficacy of that output\nfrom Locus ceruleus and what that seems\nto do is increase the coordinated firing\nof locus ceruleus neurons with\nprefrontal cortex so in many ways it's\nacting like a fine-tuning of that\nOrchestra conductor operation that is so\nvaluable in teaching these brain\ncircuits during childhood of how to\nattend to one thing and ignore\neverything else so this is one reason\nwhy guanfacine is now approved not just\nfor adults with ADHD but it's primarily\nused in kids age 6 to 17 years old for\nthe treatment of ADHD again with the\nhope that these kids can take the drug\nand these circuits can learn how to\nfocus and how to\nattend to certain things and limit\nimpulsivity and hyperactivity\nand then perhaps come off the drugs\nalthough sometimes again people have to\nstay on them indefinitely the other\nthing about guanfacine is that because\nit lowers blood pressure and it has this\neffect of kind of dampening down overall\nsympathetic arousal sometimes it is\nprescribed in conjunction with other\nADHD meds so yes there are kids out\nthere and adults out there who are\ntaking Adderall and guanfacine where\nthey're taking Vyvanse and guanfacine\nand this is where it starts to get into\ndrug cocktails and a bunch of other\nthings that gets everybody a little bit\nuncomfortable I think because the idea\nof taking one drug to dampen down the\nside effects of another drug and to\noffset things and compensate you know is\ngetting towards what's called poly\npharmacology\nand uh you know I think it's\nunderstandable that people be concerned\nabout that and yet\nagain in reviewing this with some of the\nexperts on ADHD there do seem to be a\ncertain category of children out there\nand adults who really struggle with the\nstandard ADHD meds and in that case\nguanfacine has provided a certain number\nof these individuals tremendous relief\none note about guanfacine in no way\nshape or form am I encouraging anyone\nwho's not prescribed guanfacine to take\nit but should you know someone who's\ntaking guanfacine off label in order to\nimprove their focus or enhance any\naspect of their biology or psychology\nplease let them know that it has a\nprofound effect on lowering the\ntolerance for alcohol such that even\nsmall amounts of alcohol can lead to\nreally serious problems and even\npotentially death so that's a very\nserious warning with guanfacine so today\nwe discussed a lot of different\ncompounds for the treatment of ADHD and\nit now should become clear what the\ngeneral themes of those compounds is the\ngeneral theme is that they tend to\nincrease overall levels of arousal and\nwakefulness which leads to decreased\nlevels of hyperactivity impulsivity and\nfocus and on the face of it that might\nseem counter-intuitive raise arousal to\nreduce hyperactivity and impulsivity\nindeed that's the case because these\ncompounds because they act on\nneuromodulator systems like dopamine and\nnorepine epinephrine are effective in\ncreating neuroplasticity they change the\nstrength of the connections in the\nneural circuits of the brain that lead\nto states of heightened focus and\nreduced impulsivity and reduced\nhyperactivity so we talked about the\ndifferent mechanisms by which the\ndifferent medications for ADHD\naccomplish this both the typical sort\nlike methylphenidate and adderall and\nvivance and some of the atypical\ncompounds that are now being used in\naddition such as modafinil or modafinil\nguanfacine and Wellbutrin and where\npossible I tried to highlight both the\nshort and long-term effects of these\nvarious compounds and I try to address\nsome of the major concerns about these\ncompounds most notably the question of\nwhy are we putting so many kids on\namphetamine and what is the long-term\nconsequence of that and throughout\ntoday's episode I tried to highlight\nboth the immediate and long-term\nbenefits but also the immediate and\nlong-term risks that can exist with\nthese compounds certainly when taken\nwithout a prescription recreationally\nthere is a real risk for abuse and\naddiction as well as even a risk for\npsychotic episodes but also the risks\nthat accompany long-term use of these\ndrugs in people with ADHD and yet it is\nalso clear that not treating the\nsymptoms of ADHD carry significant risk\nas well and what's very clear from the\nscientific and clinical literature and\nis covered in a significant amount of\ndetail in the episode that I did about\nADHD which you can find at\nhubermanlab.com is that combinations of\ndrug treatments and behavioral protocols\nseem to surpass either drug treatments\nor behavioral protocols alone speaking\nto the tremendous importance of\ncombining multiple methodologies when\ntreating ADHD and working with a\nboard-certified psychiatrist who really\nunderstands ADHD and is really up to\ndate on all the latest scientific and\nclinical literature\nif you're learning
