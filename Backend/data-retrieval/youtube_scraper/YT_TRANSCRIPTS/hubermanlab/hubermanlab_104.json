    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr.\nRobin Carhart-Harris.\nDr. Carhart-Harris is a\ndistinguished professor\nof neurology and psychiatry\nat the University\nof California, San Francisco.\nHe is one of the\nleading researchers\nin the field of psychedelics\nand how they change\nneural circuitry in the brain.\nHis laboratory is responsible\nfor understanding,\nfor instance, how\npsilocybin, also sometimes\nreferred to as magic\nmushrooms change\nneural circuitry in the\nbrain, such that new ideas\nand new forms of learning occur.\nHis laboratory is also\nresponsible for carrying out\nvarious clinical\ntrials, some of which\nhave demonstrated that\nappropriate dosages\nof psilocybin can alleviate\nmajor depression in more\nthan 67% of people\nthat take the drug.\nNow, this is not to say\nthat everybody should take\npsilocybin, and today's\ndiscussion describes both\nthe clinical trials and why\ntreatments with psychedelics\nin some cases work\nand in some cases\ndo not work in order to\ntreat major depression.\nAs well as discussions around\npsilocybin, lysogenic acid\ndiethylamide,\nsometimes also referred\nto as LSD, as well as DMT.\nAnd how these change the brain,\nand how those brain changes\ncan relate to changes\nin mental health,\nas it relates to depression and\nother psychiatric challenges,\nas well as how psychedelics\nare being applied\nin order to change neural\ncircuitry for sake of expanding\ndifferent aspects\nof the human mind,\nincluding creativity,\nintelligence, and much more.\nDuring today's discussion\nDr. Carhart-Harris\nteaches us about the history of\nthe study of psychedelics, as\nwell as how the legislature,\nthat is the laws surrounding\npsychedelics, are evolving\nin the United States\nand elsewhere for the\nuse of psychedelics\nto treat psychiatric challenges.\nBy the end of\ntoday's discussion,\nyou will have a\nthorough understanding\nof how psychedelics work.\nBoth in the short-term during\nthe actual journey or trip.\nIn fact, much of my discussion\ntoday with Dr. Carhart-Harris\ntalks about the\ndifferent aspects\nof the psychedelic\njourney and how those\nrelate to therapeutic outcomes.\nAnd, of course, by the\nend of today's discussion,\nyou will also understand\nthe long-term effects\nof psychedelics, that\nis, how they can actually\nrewire the brain.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor\nis Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout the fact that\nsleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nOne absolutely critical variable\nto getting excellent sleep\nis the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment.\nThat is, in order to fall and\nstay deeply asleep at night,\nyour body temperature\nneeds to actually drop\nby about 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd in order to wake\nup in the morning\nfeeling refreshed and\nalert, your body temperature\nhas to increase by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees.\nThere are a lot\nof ways to control\nthe temperature of your\nsleeping environment,\nbut one of the best\nways is to control\nthe temperature of\nyour actual mattress--\nthe surface that\nyou're sleeping on.\nWith Eight Sleep, you\ncan do this very easily.\nThere's a\nsimple-to-use app where\nyou can program in the\ntemperature of your mattress\nacross the night.\nSo you can make it slightly cool\nat the beginning of the night,\ngetting cooler, putting you\ninto deep sleep, and then\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd all of that, in terms\nof its impact on your sleep,\ncan be tracked\nwithin the same app.\nI've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover for more\nthan two years now,\nand it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman\nfor their exclusive Memorial\nDay savings now through June 5\n2023.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, United Kingdom,\nselect countries in the EU,\nand Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Levels.\nLevels is a program\nthat lets you\nsee how different foods affect\nyour health by giving you\nreal-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose\nmonitor.\nOne of the most important\nfactors in terms of your energy\nlevels and your immediate\nand long term health\nare your blood glucose\nor blood sugar levels,\nas they're commonly called.\nWith Levels, you can assess how\ndifferent foods and activities\nimpact your blood\nglucose levels.\nWhen I did this, it\ntaught me several things.\nFirst of all, it taught me\nthat certain foods really\nspike my blood glucose levels.\nAnd while spikes\nin blood glucose\naren't always a bad thing,\nI was able to assess\nhow certain foods were spiking\nmy blood glucose too much, such\nthat I would have post-eating\ndips in energy levels.\nAnd by removing those foods and\nsubstituting in other foods,\nit really evened out\nmy energy levels.\nSo if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\ngo to levels.link/huberman.\nRight now, Levels is offering\nan additional two free months\nof membership.\nAgain, that's\nlevels.link/huberman.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by HVMN Ketone-IQ.\nKetone-IQ is a ketone supplement\nthat increases blood ketones.\nNow, most people have heard of\nthe so-called ketogenic diet.\nBut most people,\nincluding myself,\nare not on the ketogenic diet.\nThat is, I and most people eat\ncomplex carbohydrates, fruits,\nand things of that\nsort in addition\nto quality proteins, et cetera.\nIt turns out that even if you're\nnot following a ketogenic diet,\nincreasing your blood ketones\ncan still have benefits.\nSo for instance, I use\nKetone-IQ anytime I\nwant to do extended\nbouts of focused work.\nPreparing for podcast,\nresearch, writing grants,\nand if I ever want to exercise\nbut I don't have time to eat\nor I don't want to have\nmy gut full of food.\nTaking Ketone-IQ and thereby\nincreasing my blood ketones\nallows me to do cognitive\nwork or physical workouts\nwithout getting hungry and with\nplenty of energy and cognitive\nfocus.\nIf you'd like to try Ketone-IQ,\nyou can go to hvmn.com/huberman\nto save 20% off.\nAgain, that's hvmn.com/huberman.\nI'm pleased to announce that I\nwill be hosting two live events\nin September of 2023.\nThe first live event will\ntake place in Toronto\non September 12.\nThe second live event\nwill take place in Chicago\non September 28.\nBoth live events will include\na lecture and a question\nand answer period\nand are entitled,\nThe Brain-Body Contract, during\nwhich I will discuss tools\nand science related to mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd I should mention that\na lot of that content\nwill have absolutely no overlap\nwith content covered previously\non the Huberman Lab\npodcast or elsewhere.\nIf you're interested in\nattending either or both\nof these events, please go\nto hubermanlab.com/tour,\nand enter the code \"Huberman\"\nto get early access to tickets.\nOnce again, that's\nhubermanlab.com/tour and use\nthe code \"Huberman\"\nto access tickets.\nI hope to see you there.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris.\nDr. Carhart-Harris, welcome.\nI've been wanting to talk\nto you for a long time.\nI certainly have known who\nyou are for quite a while,\nbecause I place you in\nthis very small but very\nspecial and important\ncategory of researchers\nwho has been pioneering\nthe use of psychedelics\nfor the treatment of\nspecific clinical conditions,\nand really carrying the\ntorch for, essentially,\nthe entire field.\nSo I want to start with\na voice of gratitude\nand say thank you for doing\nthis incredibly important work.\nCould you tell us a little bit\nabout what psychedelics are?\nIn fact, I'm curious as to\nhow the name psychedelic ever\ncame to be.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And what\nyou think they potentially\nreveal about the\nworkings of the brain.\nAnd then we'll talk about\nthe clinical applications.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure.\nWell, even that one\nis kind of hot one,\nbecause opinions differ on\nhow to define psychedelic.\nBut perhaps, a\ngood starting place\nis to start with the etymology,\nwhere did the word come from?\nAnd it was a Brit\nexcommunicated living\nin Canada Humphry Osmond\nwho was due to present\na paper at a National\nAcademy of Sciences meeting\non psychotomimetics--\ndrugs that mimic aspects of\npsychosis in their action.\nAnd certain drugs\nlike mescaline--\nlet's see, 1956-- and\nLSD were on the bill.\nAnd he felt\ndissatisfied with them\nbeing under this category\nof psychotomimetics,\nand felt that the signature\npsychological effects\nof these compounds\nwent beyond just\nmimicking psychotic symptoms.\nAnd so he wanted to\nfind a more apt term\nto speak to, in a sense,\nthe principal component\nof their action.\nAnd he jotted down a few\ndifferent possibilities\nabout a dozen or so, I think.\nAnd one of them was\npsychodelic, actually\nit started as and ended\nup being psychedelic.\nAnd he had a correspondence\ngoing on with another Brit\nalso living in the US,\nAldous Huxley, where\nthey were playing\nwith some terms\nto refer to these compounds.\nAnd in the end, Osmond\nwon with psychedelic,\nand he had this little ditty of,\nto fathom hell or soar angelic,\njust take a pinch\nof psychedelic.\nThat's where you put\nthe disclaimer in.\nAnd so what does that mean?\nIt's two ancient Greek words\npsyche, means the human mind\nor if we're being actually\ntrue to the ancient Greek it\nmeans soul.\nAnd then the other component\nmeans to make clear\nor to make visible or to\nmake manifest or to reveal.\nSo all of those work.\nAnd it's a neologism.\nIt's a made up word.\nBut it does have that\nancient Greek origin.\nAnd it's speaking\nto this principle\nthat these compounds reveal\naspects of the psyche,\nof the human mind, the soul\nthat are ordinarily not\nentirely visible.\nAnd so that's the etymology,\nand it's wonderfully poetic.\nBut I happen to think\nit's also very accurate.\nIt's a useful term,\nbecause it's sort of,\nyou might say\nvalence nonspecific.\nIt doesn't say, you're\ngoing to have a great time\nor that you're going to go mad.\nIt's more that-- it reveals a\npsyche, and it could be hellish\nbut it could be heavenly.\nSo that's the etymology and\nalso a bit of the psychology.\nAnd sort of pointing\nto the phenomenology,\nthe subjective experience.\nBut there's also a\npharmacology here.\nAnd quite recently, there was\nput out a consensus statement\nabout psychedelics\nthat's really referring\nto what we call the classic\npsychedelics to say that these\nare all compounds that work\non a particular receptor\nin the brain, the\nserotonin 2A receptor.\nAnd that's another way that we\ncould define these compounds.\nI said this one's a little\nhot, because I'm of the view\nthat while the pharmacology\nis really useful, how\nthe drugs work chemically, you\ncan't avoid the phenomenology.\nAnd if we're true\nto the etymology,\nwhere the term came from,\nthen we must recognize,\nand we cannot neglect the\nsubjective experience.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you\nfor that beautiful description\nof what brought us\nto today in terms\nof using the word psychedelics.\nAnd now, it's thrown\naround all the time.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nToo much.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nToo much.\nAnd I'm guessing--\nwell, not guessing.\nI'm certain that it's also used\nto describe many compounds that\ndon't touch the 5-HT2A,\nthe serotonin 2A receptor.\nSo there is a broader\ncategorization by most people.\nAnd it'll be interesting to\nsee where all the nomenclature\nand naming goes.\nFor the time being, I'd\nlove for you to tell us\na bit more about this idea\nthat psychedelics, however\none defines them, can reveal\nsomething about the mind that\ncan't be revealed otherwise.\nAre you talking about\nthe subconscious?\nI mean, psychologists and most\nfamously, Freud but also Jung\nand also neuroscientists, I\nthink, think about subconscious\nprocessing.\nI think, perhaps, the\nmost salient example\nfor me that's outside the\nrealm of anything psychedelic\nwould be blindsight.\nThis phenomenon that you take\npeople that are blind but still\nhave some connectivity\nin their brain\nand you present\nthem a board with--\nor a computer screen with\ndifferent number of dots\non each side and you\nsay how many dots\nare on each side of the screen,\nand they say, what do you mean?\nI can't see the screen.\nI'm blind.\nAnd you say, well, just guess.\nAnd their guess rate\nis accurate far more\nthan chance would predict.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So they\nhave so-called blindsight,\nand people have said, well,\nthis is the subconscious\nrevealing itself.\nThere's no psychedelic\ndrug involved.\nBut what you're describing is\na pharmacologic-induced state\nthat reveals something that\nnormally should we assume is\nmasked or that we\nare oblivious to--\neven though it's\nexpressing itself.\nWhat does it mean\nfor these drugs\nto be revealing something about\nthe workings of the mind that\nwould not be obvious\nto us, otherwise.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nSo the example of blindsight is\ninteresting but it's different.\nBlindsight would be referring to\nnon-conscious processing, maybe\nimplicit processing.\nSo stuff going on in\nthe mind in perception\nin a sense that is\nbelow the threshold\nof conscious awareness.\nBut yet is influencing you.\nSo it's sort-- it's kind of\nrelated, but it's different.\nSo in depth, psychology,\npsychoanalysis, psychodynamic,\npsychology, Sigmund Freud,\nCarl Jung, and so on.\nWe talk about the unconscious.\nAnd there, it's more\nabout the kind of blood\nand guts of the human\ncondition, the human nature--\nboth the personal unconscious.\nSo things that\nyou might not want\nto necessarily be conscious\nof, because it's painful.\nSo that's the repression\naspect pushing it out\nof conscious awareness.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Repressed\nmemories in particular?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nLike traumatic memories,\ndifficult relationships.\nIt could be complex\ntrauma, not necessarily\njust a specific index trauma,\nbut a series of trauma.\nAnd then you have the\ncollective unconscious,\nwhich was really Carl\nJung's contribution\nto say that there's a\ntranspersonal quality\nto the unconscious.\nThere's aspects about humans,\nnot just this individual human.\nThere's aspects to our\nminds, our psyches that\nare not fully available\nto conscious awareness,\nbut can come up\nin certain states.\nPsychoanalysis went crazy for\ndreaming as their royal road\nto a knowledge of\nthe unconscious.\nThat was Freud.\nBut we now with\npsychedelics, and this\nwas what drew me into the area.\nWas discovering\nliterature that was\nspeaking to this particular\naction, the psychedelic action.\nAnd was saying that\nwhen these drugs--\nlike LSD, psilocybin\nfound in magic mushrooms,\nwhen they're used\nin psychotherapy,\nmaterial comes up that may be\nmay have been repressed that\nis of therapeutic value\nand awareness and insight\nof this material\nseems to catalyze\nthe therapeutic process with\nstrong emotional release.\nThese cathartic\nexperiences and insights.\nWhether they're insights\nthat are personal\nor whether they're\ntranspersonal.\nBut for me, this is really\nwhere the meat of it\nis with psychedelics and classic\npsychedelics, in particular.\nThe likes of compounds\nlike LSD and psilocybin.\nI would say that if it\nwasn't for this action\nby classic psychedelics,\nwe wouldn't be\nso interested in psychedelics.\nI think, if we only had\ncompounds like ketamine, MDMA\ncannabis, that could be\nsaid, broadly speaking,\nto be psychedelic-like.\nI don't think it\nnecessarily would\nhave captured the world's\nattention as psychedelics\nare right now.\nI actually think it's\na major gap to fill.\nIs this principal action of\nthe classic psychedelics.\nWhat does this mean\nthat I'm referring to?\nPsyche-revealing.\nWhat is that?\nAnd I suppose where\nI'm going with this\nis, what is that in terms\nof the biology as well?\nWhat's going on in\nthe brain and the body\nwhen people become\naware of things\nthat previously they\nweren't fully aware of.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd\nlike to talk about some\nof the clinical trials that\nyou've been involved with.\nIn particular,\nlooking at psilocybin.\nAs you mentioned, the principal\nhallucinatory psychedelic agent\nin magic mushrooms.\nI'd like to start with a kind\nof nuts and bolts question\njust so that everyone's\non the same page.\nI've read the papers\nthat you've published\nand that others have\npublished in this area.\nAnd typically, the dosages\nused in these trials\nare 25 milligrams of psilocybin.\nAnd we talk about\none recent trial,\nin particular, that\ncompared 25 to 10 milligrams\nto more frequent use\nof very small amounts.\n1 milligram over 3\nweeks, for instance.\nHowever, when people talk\nabout magic mushrooms,\nthey often talk about gram\ndoses of the mushroom,\nbecause I'm assuming that\nthey contain milligram\ndosages of psilocybin.\nHere, we're not encouraging\nuse of any kind.\nThese are clinical trials.\nBut for clarity of\nunderstanding, what\nis the conversion, typically?\nLike 1 gram of\nmagic mushrooms will\ncontain how many milligrams\nof psilocybin on average.\nBecause what I'm\ntrying to do here\nis calibrate people to\nthis idea of microdosing\nversus macrodosing.\nAnd that's fairly\nstraightforward\nto do with respect to\nthe clinical trials.\nBut then in a lot of the\nlay discussion around this,\nyou hear about heroic\ndoses versus microdoses.\nAnd so I think there's\na lot of confusion.\nSo if you would,\neducate us on this idea\nof what's a microdose.\nAnd perhaps, also how many\nmilligrams of psilocybin\nare contained in a gram of quote\nunquote, \"magic mushrooms?\"\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure.\nWell, a microdose is\nneither of these are that.\nSimple.\nBut they're fun.\nIt's a fun challenge.\nBut microdose, one\ndefinition is that it's\na dose of typically a\nclassic psychedelic like LSD\nor psilocybin that has some\nperceptible psychedelic\neffects.\nIt doesn't put you into a\nnoticeable altered state\nof consciousness that\nfeels like you're tripping.\nAnd if that was LSD, it\nlooks as though the threshold\nis around about, let's\nsee, 10, 11, 12 micrograms.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Micrograms.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nMicrograms.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Want\nto be very clear here.\nMicrograms.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\n10 micrograms of LSD,\nare you saying will not induce\nvisual hallucinations in most\npeople?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: So\nthat's threshold level.\nThat's about the level that\nsome people who are sensitive\ncould feel it.\nBut if you were to talk\nto the microdosing gurus,\nthey might say that that's\nthe ballpark for an LSD dose\nthat you would\nconsider a micro dose,\nand then you would\ntake semi-regularly.\nIt's typically\nsomething like one day\non, one day off or one\nday on, two days off.\nThis kind of thing.\nThere's different protocols.\nAnd yeah.\nSo some like Jim Fadiman--\none of the popularizers\nof microdosing, I think\nwould say that a true microdose\nshould be sub-perceptible.\nYou shouldn't feel\nit, yet the assumption\nis it's going to change you\nin some way on a kind of trait\nlevel more than a state\nlevel, and maybe behaviorally.\nAnd the typical story goes,\nit will improve well-being.\nAnd maybe, maybe,\nit could improve\ncertain aspects\nof cognition, say,\nrelated to creative thinking.\nI emphasize the maybe\nthere because that's\nanother angle with microdosing.\nWe're waiting for some\ncompelling evidence.\nAs things stand\nright now, I'd say,\nwe lack that\ncompelling evidence.\nThere's some suggestive stuff,\nbut often the study designs\naren't that strong.\nIt's really hard to do a\nstudy with microdosing,\nbecause you need to have\npermission to give people\na microdose that for\npractical reasons,\nthey would go home with,\notherwise, you're requiring\nthem to be in the lab, say\nthree times a week for x number\nof weeks to meet the criteria\nof a course of microdosing,\nwhich might be two or three\ntimes a week for say, a month.\nAnd that's a hard thing\nto do in a lab study.\nIt's expensive.\nYou'd need to do that\nagainst a suitable control,\nso a placebo control.\nAnd there is a study\nthat's been done\nin New Zealand that has some\ninteresting preliminary data\nthat did--\nI think did the design right.\nBut it hasn't been\npublished yet.\nI've seen some positive\nfindings presented\naround improvements in mood.\nBut it's a bit early to\nget too excited about that.\nIt needs to go through\npeer review and all that.\nBut as things stand, the\nevidence is pretty thin.\nAnd we have to be\nhonest about that.\nWe did quite a creative study\nwith my colleagues at Imperial.\nThe guy leading that, Balazs\nSzigeti, a Hungarian chap,\ndid a really creative design.\nVery much his brainchild.\nHe instructed people to\ndo their own blinding,\ntheir own\nplacebo-controlled blinding\nof their own microdosing.\nSo this was a classic\ncitizen science study\nlike do it yourself science\nwhere they would get their LSD\ntabs and chop them up, put\nthem into gel capsules,\nopaque, and have other capsules\nthat are the placebos that they\njust close empty capsule.\nAnd then there was a whole\nbarcode scan technique\nso that you kind\nof shuffle them up.\nBut they've got the\nbarcode in, the QR code.\nSo you can break\nthe code later on,\nbut once you've\nshuffled them up,\nyou no longer know which\nones had the microdosing\nand which ones are empty.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Was this LSD?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThis was LSD.\nAlso tried it with\nmushrooms, but the issues\nwith the mushrooms was\npeople would burp sometimes.\nThey'd belch.\nAnd then they'd have\nthis mushroom taste.\nSo then he instructed\npeople to get\nsome non-psychoactive\nmushroom material to put in.\nSo it's really--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNot an easy study.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\n--not an easy study.\nAnd it was-- I love\nthat kind of science.\nReal creative first\nmover kind of science.\nAnd the results\nwere fascinating,\nbecause the short story is\nthat the microdosing didn't\ncompellingly beat the placebo.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It did not.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It didn't.\nAnd he controlled,\nbecause he asked.\nHe controlled for expectancy.\nSo people's positive expectancy,\nwhich is, in a sense,\nthe vehicle that carries\nthe placebo response.\nIt's why you have a placebo.\nIs that positive expectancy\ncan drive a therapeutic effect\nto a large extent.\nSo you measured that\npre-trial and then used\nit to correct for the response.\nAnd how did it work?\nThose who got a\nplacebo but thought\nthey got a microdose\ndid as well as those\nwho thought they got a microdose\nand did get a microdose.\nSo it was the bigger effect--\nthe majority of the\neffect was in thinking\nthat you got a microdose.\nSo in a sense, it was a victory\nfor the power of the placebo\nresponse.\nAnd it's created all\nsorts of controversy.\nPeople don't want to believe\nit, that kind of thing.\nBut that's the beauty\nof science, isn't it?\nThat science is not about\nwhat you want to believe.\nThat right there is\nthe beauty of science.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove that experiment.\nKudos to them.\nI'm not going to attempt to\nsay his last name correctly.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I tried.\nYeah.\nProbably you made a mess of it--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nNo.\nI think you got it.\nYou were involved in\na clinical trial that\nwas published last\nyear comparing\n25 milligrams of psilocybin\nto 10 milligrams of psilocybin\nto a drug called escitalopram.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Lexapro.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Lexapro?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And this 1\nmilligram over a 3-week dosage.\nI'm wanting to discuss the\nresults of that study a bit\nand some of the other\ntrials that you've\ndone involving psilocybin\nfor depression,\nthe treatment of depression.\nCould we calibrate ourselves?\n25 milligrams of\npsilocybin, is that what--\nit's going to be a\nperceptible dose presumably.\nHallucinations and all that.\nAnd is that what\none would find in--\nI'm guessing here,\nif I'm accurate,\nthis does not mean that\nI have experience here.\nBut 2 grams of mushrooms?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's\nmore than that we think.\nYeah.\nSorry.\nI missed that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, no.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nI missed that one.\nWent off on a tangent.\nBut yeah.\n25 milligrams of\npsilocybin would be--\nwe don't know,\nand it's important\nthat I say that because\nI wouldn't want people\nto hear my answer\nhere, and then use\nit to calibrate their\nown dosing of mushrooms\nand get it way off.\nSo it's guesswork.\nAnd I would love to see someone\ndo a proper study on it.\nAnd look at the\npsilocybin content\nin a given mass of psilocybin\nmushrooms, magic mushrooms.\nBut to my knowledge, that\nhasn't really been done.\nSomeone like Paul Stamets would\ngive a better answer here.\nBut I think the percentage\nwithin the mushroom mass is--\nof psilocybin in the\nmushroom mass and psilocin\nwhich is the metabolite\nof psilocybin\nis something in the 1%, a\nlittle bit higher, maybe, range.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo 1 gram, 1000 milligrams\nof magic mushroom\nwould contain about 10\nmilligrams of psilocybin.\nIs that right?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nBroadly speaking, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nGreat.\nThat helps calibrate.\nAnd I think, again, just\nallows the layperson\nto understand a\nbit more of where\nwe're headed with\nthese psilocybin\ntrials and the results.\nSo we don't have to\nrestrict our discussion\nto just that I clinical trial.\nBut if we include that\none and compare it\nto some of the other\ntrials that you've done,\nI mean, your laboratory\nis seeing phenomenal--\nin my opinion,\nphenomenal results\nin the treatment of, otherwise,\nintractable depression,\nmajor depression, which so\nmany people suffer from.\nFrom two-- I suppose\nthere two sessions\nof using psilocybin in these\nranges of 10 to 25 milligrams.\nDo I have that correct?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nCould we talk a little bit\nabout what people typically\nexperience during\nthose sessions that\nallows this phenomenal\ntransformation of mood\nand state and trait as well?\nAnd I'm especially\ninterested in whether or not\nit is the experience\nduring those sessions that\nis the trigger that's necessary\nfor the transformation\nfrom a depressed to a\nnon-depressed state.\nBecause the impulse\nis to think it is.\nThat what one thinks and\nsees and hallucinates is--\nand hears is so vital.\nBut of course, these drugs can\ncreate neuroplasticity changes\nin our neural wiring, presumably\nfor long periods of time.\nSo what are your thoughts\non the experience itself?\nAnd maybe for those who have\nnot done these compounds before,\nyou could explain a\nlittle bit about what's\ntypical for people,\nand what you think\nis leading to that incredible\npositive and pervasive change\nin mood, state, and trait.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I would\nsay that it's more than impulse\nthat is leading us to think that\nthe experience is important.\nIt's really data and\nconverging evidence now.\nSo independent teams,\nindependent studies\nare converging on the magnitude\nof certain kinds of experience\nrated, yes, with\nsubjective rating scales\nis predicting\ntherapeutic outcomes.\nPretty strongly\nand very reliably.\nAnd so that's guiding us.\nNow, could you say, well,\nmaybe those experiences\nare some kind of epiphenomenon\nof say, a central brain action?\nWell, absolutely.\nBut then all experience\nare epiphenomenon\nby that principle.\nAnd yet we care\nabout it, you know?\nAnd it matters to us and\nin our human relations\nwith each other.\nSo I think it does\nmatter to a human being\nwhen they're in say, a\npsilocybin therapy session,\nand as the drug effects\nbegin to come on\nand the body starts to feel\na little strange and tingly\nand there's some\ninitial anxiety.\nAnd then in their\nmind's eye, they\nstart to notice patterns\nand maybe colors\nand then, maybe, those patterns\ndeepen and they're dynamic\nand they have this\nfascinating organic quality.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Are they--\npatients in your studies\ntypically using an eye mask?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthey're in the eye mask?\nSo eyes closed?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's why\nyou said mind's eye as opposed\nto looking out into\nthe clinical setting.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes.\nAnd that's one of\nthe major differences\nto psychedelic therapy\nversus taking a psychedelic.\nIs you shut your eyes.\nAnd it's a world away\nfrom taking a psychedelic.\nYeah.\nA rave or something.\nIn a sense, good luck with that.\nBut in psychedelic\ntherapy, yeah.\nIt's settled conditions.\nThere's music playing.\nAnd what I'm describing here\nis very much the default.\nThere's actually very\nlittle variability\nbetween the different\nsites that have done\nthis work on these conditions.\nTypically, it's two people.\nIdeally, mental health\nprofessionals, at least one\nwho's a psychiatrist or\na clinical psychologist\nor some other kind of\npsychotherapist or psychiatric\nnurse.\nBut ideally, two who\nmeet those criteria\nwith a individual who's ingested\nthe drug and music playing\nthroughout.\nA kind of runway into taking\nthe drug and then throughout,\nso there's continuity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They're music\nwith lyrics or without lyrics?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Without\nlyrics, to begin with,\nand the music typically\nis spacious to begin with.\nAnd then builds and\nbecomes atmospheric.\nThere might be, I don't\nknow, some tribal drums\nin the distance or\nsomething as it develops\nor like the sound of a\nbird in the distance.\nA call.\nAnd then as it gets into\nmore stronger drug effects,\nthe music starts\nto coax emotion,\nand very intentionally, strings,\nfor example, would come in\nand it would be an\ninteresting experiment and one\nthat we'd love to do actually\nto see whether if you were\nto pull that out, whether the\npsychedelic experience would\nbe as emotionally intense as\nit is in psychedelic therapy\nwhen you have music\nthere as a default.\nAnd across the board, people\nshould find this remarkable,\nbecause it kind of is.\nAll of the published\nstudies that\nare now having such an impact\non psychiatry and beyond\nhave music there as\na staple component.\nAnd we just take it as\nassumption that it needs to be.\nI tend to share that assumption.\nBut it's remarkable that it\nhasn't been tested properly.\nBut it's there.\nAnd if you were\nto run with that,\nand if you had a critical\nagenda, you would say,\nwell, this is music therapy.\nWhy are you making all this\nfuss about psychedelics\nwhen it's music that's there\nin all of these trials with all\nthese fantastic findings.\nSo there is something to that.\nAnd this will tee me\nup probably to talk\nabout psychedelic-therapy\nbeing a combination treatment.\nWe have a hyphen\nbetween the two,\nbecause I share the hypothesis.\nThe assumption that\nshould be tested better.\nThere is a positive\ninteraction between the two.\nThat there's a synergy\nbetween the two.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's why\nit's psychedelic-therapy\nwith a hyphen, just\nlike Carhart-Harris.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: OK.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break,\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nin Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3 K2.\nThis is extremely\nuseful to hear because I\nthink most people think, OK.\nPsychedelic.\nWhether or not they\nhave experience\nwith psychedelics or not, get\nsome visual hallucinations,\nsome auditory hallucinations,\nsome synesthesia,\nsome visual auditory blending,\nsomatosensation, you know?\nRubbing a surface and\nbeing able to elicit\nthe sounds in one's mind.\nOf course, et cetera.\nBut so seldom do\nwe actually hear\nabout the specifics of these\nclinical trials in a way that,\nfor instance, points to\nmusic as one of the, perhaps,\nkey variables.\nNow, you mentioned\nthat as people\nenter these psychedelic states,\nthat there's a little bit\nof initial anxiety.\nAbout a year and a half\nago, I had a discussion\nwith Dr. Matthew Johnson who's\nrunning some psilocybin trials\nat Johns Hopkins, as you know.\nAnd he mentioned the\ncritical importance,\nat least in his\nmind, to this idea\nof the patient, quote\nunquote, \"letting\ngo\" or allowing the experience\nto take them someplace mentally\nas opposed to\ntrying to constrain\ntheir sensory and\ncognitive experience.\nI'm curious what your\nreflections are on that idea.\nAnd why it might be so\nvaluable clinically.\nAnd this ties back to\nthis earlier discussion\nwe were having about\nthe unconscious\nor about psychedelics\nrevealing something that's\nthere all the time but that\nwe don't have access to.\nAnd again, I'm struggling\nto find the right language\nfor this, because\nwe don't really\nhave a neural mechanism\nlike top-down inhibition\nor something like\nthat to explain how\nthis unconscious\nmight be uncorked\nin the psychedelic experience.\nBut to make it quite simple and\ndirect, how important do you\nthink it really\nis for the patient\nto feel like they are,\nquote unquote, \"letting go\"\nand what in the\nworld is \"letting go\"\nin biological terms?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nWell, I think we'll\nget there in terms\nof having the neural\ncorrelates of the mind\nrevealing itself to itself.\nThe emergence of the\nunconscious into consciousness\nor unconscious material\ninto conscious awareness.\nIt's a wonderful challenge.\nIt's a huge challenge, but\nit's a challenge to embrace.\nAnd letting go very\nmuch is, again,\na staple component of\nhow the different teams\ndo this work in terms of\nencouraging a willingness\nto let go.\nAnd when we started out\ndoing our depression work\nand did that first trial,\nit was the first trial\nof psychedelic in a formally\ndiagnosed depression, you know?\nWhere that was the\ntarget population.\nA depressed population.\nIt was the first modern\nstudy to do that.\nAnd we visited\nHopkins, friends there\nand were mentored on how to do\nthe guiding Bill Richards, Mary\nCusumano.\nThey were just so brilliant and\nwise in their guidance to us\nas how to do the\nguiding in our trial.\nAnd so this phrase of trust, let\ngo, be open, you'll hear a lot.\nI don't know who fairly it\nshould be attributed to,\nbut I would attribute\nit to Bill Richards.\nYeah.\nEverything's borrowed.\nYou probably got it\nfrom someone else.\nBut it's such a key principle.\nAnd it's almost like\na mantra that you're\ntrying to instill in people.\nTrust, let go, be open.\nAnd those different\ncomponents where the trust\nis about the therapeutic\nrapport that, again, this\ngoes beyond just intuition now.\nWe formerly measured\ntherapeutic rapport.\nWe do it even with just a single\nitem, a visual analog scale\nitem, a subjective rating scale\nitem on the morning of dosing,\nand we find that it's\na significant predictor\nof the quality of the\nexperience that you\nhave under the drug in\nthe psychedelic therapy,\nand then the therapeutic\noutcomes x weeks or months\nlater.\nSo very powerful chain\nof predictive components\nthere, but trust,\nessentially, important.\nAnd again, not just to intuition\nbut the data pointing to that.\nLet go, there's a readiness\nto surrender, to let go,\nto not resist.\nAnd we do measure that\ntoo and see that it's\npredictive of response.\nAnd then the being open is\nabout a willingness to go there,\nto confront, to be inquisitive.\nSomething that's\neasier said than done.\nCan be terrifying.\nWhen you're dealing with a\nvery vulnerable population,\nit's probably more--\nthe rule then, the\nexception that they're\ncarrying some significant\nadversity, life adversity\nor frank trauma that\nthey've suffered.\nAnd so that message of be\nopen, be willing to confront\nand to go there is\nreally powerful.\nAnd that's how it plays out.\nAnd often, there is struggle.\nThere's something\ngoing on that is I\ndon't want to be feeling this.\nMake it stop.\nThat can be\nnightmarish at times,\nbut it's very, very strong.\nAnd with these big doses that\nwe give, it's very strong.\nAnd actually, a\nstudent that I've\nworked with, I think now\ndoing a PhD, at Harry Brouwer\nis working on a fantastic\nproject characterizing\nthe different phases of\nthe psychedelic experience\nwhere the early\nphase is dominated\nby negative emotions and\nnegatively-valenced feelings\nof anxiety and struggle.\nAnd then it's a different\nstory in the latter half.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could\nI ask about that?\nFirst of all, I think that's\nfascinating and important\nto analyze the different phases\nand, again, I'm delighted\nhere because people\ntypically hear\nabout a psychedelic\njourney but we never\nreally hear about the\nstereotypic components\nof the beginning, middle,\nand end of that journey.\nWe know that there's a peak\nand that there's a parachuting\ndown and et cetera.\nBut when you say that typically\nthere's an anxiety, maybe\nsome negative valence\nin the early stage,\ndo you mean about the sensations\npeople are experiencing\nor about some prior event\nthat's being called to mind\nthat they're remembering?\nLikewise, for the positive\nphase of the psychedelic\njourney or trip are people--\ndo they still call it a trip?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: All right.\nFor the-- I guess,\nwe'll use trip.\nFor the psychedelic trip.\nAre people feeling positive\nabout the experience like, uh.\nLike there's been some\nsort of breakthrough\nor they're in a\ncalmer state, or is it\nthat they tend to be\nfocusing on prior events\nthat were positive.\nSo in other words,\nis there a threading\nthrough of some concept that\ncomes to mind for people?\nMaybe about an earlier trauma\nor maybe about a sense of self\nor a sense of other forgiveness.\nIt could be any of these things.\nBut what do we know about the\nfiner details of all that?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nI would say, the\ninitial struggle\nis more against the\ngeneral drug effects\nthan pinning it on\nsomething specific.\nIt's more that normal\nwaking consciousness.\nWe have a sense,\ngenerally speaking,\nif we're well or well enough, a\nsense of assuredness about what\nis a table here and so on.\nAnd we have that assuredness\nto an extent about ourselves\nas well.\nIt might be illusory,\nbut we have it.\nAnd what the drug's doing is\nit's breaking down all of that.\nAnd it's scary as hell.\nAnd if it's a big dose,\nit's just like human nature\nto rage against that a\nbit and a bit like dying.\nI don't want this.\nIt feels like I could be dying.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nmight lose my mind.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nThat too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'd never come back.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThose two are the classics.\nIs oh, but I might know that\nI've taken a psychedelic\nand I might even know a\nbit about psychedelics,\nbut I still fear that\nI'm going to go mad\nor I know that\ngenerally speaking,\nthese drugs don't have\na high fertility risk.\nI still think I'm going to die.\nAnd it's very palpable\nand that comes up.\nSo yeah.\nI mean, those are\nthe core fears.\nThat those two and very\nreliably, that comes up.\nAnd it's really like\na basic drug action.\nIt's dose-dependent but\nit's a basic drug action\nthat is forcing something\nabout the nature\nof the mind and the\nway it's made up\nthat makes it feel that way,\nbut it feels like I'm losing\nmy mind or it feels like\nI could lose my mind\nor that I could go insane\nor that maybe I'm dying here\nand this is bad.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You've\ntalked many times before\nand have done really\nwonderful work looking\nat the changes in communication\nbetween different brain areas\nwhile people are under the\ninfluence of psychedelics.\nAnd I think the gestalt of those\ndata, correct me if I'm wrong,\nis that compared to the\nnon-psychedelic state, that\nunder psychedelic influence.\nThere is far more--\nlet's just call it\ninterconnectivity\nor communication between brain\nareas that typically aren't\ncommunicating, which\nprobably is not\nsurprising to people given\nthe subjective effects\nof these drugs.\nWhat is the evidence that\nafter the psychedelic journey\nis over, that some\nor perhaps all\nof that enhanced communication\nacross brain areas\nis maintained?\nAnd if so, what role\ndo you feel that could\nplay in these incredible\npositive therapeutic outcomes?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nSo we've had some recent\nfindings in that direction\nwhere, yes, it's true.\nAnd picture says\na thousand words\nthat some people might be\nfamiliar with are these two\ncircles project that\nwe did in collaboration\nwith some researchers where\nordinarily, the communication\nis going on within\nsystems like other regions\nof the visual system\nwill be speaking mostly\nwithin the visual system.\nThere'll be a kind of\ncliquishness or a modularity\nto the quality of the\ncommunication in the brain.\nAnd then the cool finding with\npsilocybin was the first paper,\nis that the communication, yes.\nIt transcends these modules and\nbecomes much more inter-modular\ncrossing different modalities\nand that effect correlated\nwith the magnitude of\nthe subjective effects\nand then we replicated it with\nLSD using different methods.\nAnd a new paper\nwill come out soon\nwith DMT showing\na similar effect.\nIt's a bit of a debate\nabout what regions are most\nimplicated.\nBut the general effect of an\nincrease in global functional\nconnectivity is what we call\nit or global communication\nin the brain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And this\nis while under the influence\nof these drugs.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThis is under the--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So putting\npeople into a brain scanner\nwhile they are under the\ninfluence of the drug.\nIs that right?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That itself\nmust be quite an experience,\ngiven that these\nscanners are small tubes.\nYou're in a bite bar, you've\ngot a bite bar in your mouth.\nThat's quite a study.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nYou don't always\nhave a bite bar, at least\nwith the psychedelics.\nBut yeah.\nYou've got to keep\nyour head still.\nAnd you have the loud\nMR scanner noise going.\nBut because it's regular, there\naren't too many surprises.\nSo it's actually\nsurprisingly tolerable.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\nin a hospital setting.\nSo you're not worried about\nwhat would happen if you had\na cardiac event or something.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYou got professionals around,\nand most people generally\ntolerate that setting quite\nwell, surprisingly well.\nBut yeah.\nWe do all that.\nAnd yes, we do\nsee the opening up\nof the communication across\nsystems in the brain.\nAnd it does speak\nto intuition about\nthe subjective experience.\nThe different modalities might\nbe blending with each other.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry\nfor interrupting,\nbut I have to ask, is it\nthought that the activation\nof the serotonin\n2A receptors what's\nresponsible for the increased\ncommunication between brain\nareas that under\nnormal circumstances\nwould not be communicated?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes.\nSo there's a few reasons why\nsome modeling work that--\ncomputational modeling work that\nfirst identifies where the 2A\nreceptor is and then looks at--\nmodels its basic effect\non neural activity.\nWill recapitulate the--\nor recreate the effect\nthat we see actually in\nthe data with the scanning.\nSo doing the\ncomputational modeling.\nYou can see the same effect by\nknowing where the key receptors\nare and then making them\ndo a certain thing that we\nknow psychedelics do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I can\nimagine two possibilities.\nAnd I think it's important to\ndistinguish between these two.\nOne possibility is that the\nactivation of this serotonin 2A\nreceptor leads to\nincreased connectivity\nand thereby auditory and\nvisual hallucinations emerge,\nchanged patterns of\nthinking emerge, et cetera.\nThat's the obvious\ninterpretation.\nBut the scientist\nin me has to ask,\nis it possible that all of\nthat increased connectivity\nis occurring, and yet that is\na distinct phenomenon layered\non top of some other effect\nof the psychedelic drugs\nimpacting access to the\nunconscious, hallucinations?\nIn other words, is it the\nincreased connectivity\nthat's leading to the\nsubjective experience,\nor are those two things\nhappening in parallel?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well,\nthey happen in parallel\nand they map to each other.\nBut the question of\ncausality, what causes what,\nis the tricky thing\nwhere I would suggest\nthat the causality is circular.\nThat they influence each other.\nAnd this gets a\nbit philosophical.\nBut it matters, because\notherwise, there's\na trap that it's easy to fall\ninto where you're thinking\nthat it's all about\nthe brain action\ncausing the\nsubjective experience.\nAnd that's typically what we\ndo in cognitive neuroscience.\nIt's like the first port of\ncall materialist approach.\nBut one can be a materialist,\nessentially, but still\nappreciate that circular\ncausality that mind also\ninteracts with brain.\nAnd it's so hard to\npick the two apart.\nAnd there is a kind\nof essential dualism\nwhere subjective experience\nis a thing in and of itself.\nBut that's not to\ndivorce it from what's\ngoing on the biological level.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe reason I ask\nis because as I understand\nit, nowadays, there's\na bit of a movement within\nthe scientific community\nthat studies psychedelics\nto develop drugs that can,\nessentially, cure\nor alleviate many\nof the symptoms of\ndepression or trauma\nthat are built off our\nunderstanding of how\npsychedelics like psilocybin and\nhere I'll throw MDMA in there,\nalthough classically not a\npsychedelic, it gets lumped in.\nWe can get back to that later.\nBut that do not\nproduce hallucinations\nor massive changes in\nsubjective experience.\nActually, I think this\nis what initially got us\ninto conversation\non Twitter as I\nhad learned about this\npaper published out\nof a group at UC Davis.\nThat essentially\nmodifying psychedelics\nso that they have potential\ntherapeutic application\nfor the treatment of\ndepression but zero\nhallucinogenic properties.\nAnd I thought, wow.\nThis is going to be a\nvery controversial thing\nin the world, right?\nBecause the history\nof psychedelics,\nas you pointed out,\nhas been one of people\naccessing different modes\nof thinking, feeling.\nSeeing things and letting go.\nTrust, et cetera.\nA therapeutic relationship.\nAnd here we have--\nI don't want to say pharma\nbecause it's not really pharma,\nbut we have laboratories who\nare trying to tease apart\nthe activation of receptors\nindependent of all\nthat subjective\nexperience in order\nto, essentially, treat\nthe same conditions.\nI'd love for you to\ncomment on this, where\nyou think it might be going.\nAnd whether or not\nyou think that's\nthe right or the wrong approach,\nif it has any validity at all.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It is\npharmas, just smaller pharma,\nsort of startup pharma.\nBut--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo because pharma\nwould like to have\ndrugs that can cure depression\nbut don't make people\nhallucinate.\nIs that correct?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nOh, they would.\nAnd patients might\nand the system\nwould love it, because\nthe system is used to it.\nIt's medicine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nAnd it doesn't give this mental\nimagery of the Summer of Love\nin San Francisco or of\nkaleidoscope eyes, right?\nIt's more of--\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\ncan imagine, the more--\nI have to be careful\nwith my wording here.\nThose who would not be\ninclined toward that\nmight embrace a therapeutic\nthat is strictly\neffective at treating depression\nwith no hallucinations.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd it doesn't look like an\nindividual lying on a sofa\ncrying their eyes out about\nthe life that they've lived.\nAnd that deep catharsis\nbeing life-transforming.\nIs very different\nfrom that model.\nI'm skeptical of it\nfor a few reasons.\nAnd one is that I\ncan't see the logic--\nI can't see the pieces fit\nin a way that's compelling.\nAnd I'm also skeptical,\nbecause I think it could easily\nbe wishful thinking, because\nof that point that patients\nwould like it and the\nsystem would like it.\nAnd you got to bear\nthat in mind as well.\nSo wouldn't it be\nconvenient if it were true\nand you could get the\ntherapeutic action\nwithout the psychedelic effects?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, in a way, that's\na little bit of what microdosing\nseems to be designed to do.\nLike you said, take dosages\nthat are below that perceptual\nor awareness of some\neffect threshold\nover a longer period of time in\nan attempt to ping the circuits\nor alter the circuits\nbut not hallucinate.\nNot have a catharsis.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: So\nif microdosing can do that,\nand it's sub-perceptible,\nthen microdosing\nisn't a psychedelic\naction, because whereas\nthe psychedelic action.\nWhen psychedelic, when defined,\nmeans psyche revealing.\nYou're not getting that effect.\nYou might be getting\nthe pharmacology,\nyou might be getting some\ndirect serotonin to a receptor\nagonism that could be driving\na therapeutic response,\nbut you can get that\nwith SSRIs as well.\nAnd so my point is, what's new?\nOK.\nMaybe it's a bit new\nand people are now\ndeveloping direct 2A\nagonists rather than indirect\nthrough a serotonin releaser\nlike the selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors,\nthe SSRIs like Lexapro.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAre there any SSRIs\nthat selectively agonize,\nwhich folks by the way means,\nactivate, in a good way.\nAgony sounds terrible.\nThose not informed might\nthink that mean that disrupt.\nBut that can activate the\nserotonin 2A receptor.\nAre there any drugs that will\ndo that are not psychedelic?\nI'm not aware of any,\nbut then again I'm\nnot a psychopharmacologist.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWell, there are.\nI mean, are there any\nthat are licensed and used\nas medicines in psychiatry?\nI actually had this debate\nrecently on social media,\nand I couldn't see a\ncompelling example.\nI saw 2A agonists that\nwere used for other things.\nYou have a compound\nlike Lesuride\nused in treating Parkinson's,\nbut actually it's\nmore of a dopamine agonist.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nSo they're always hitting\nother things, right?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey're always tapping\nother neurotransmitters--\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: All that\nbeing used for other things.\nSo is there a\nselective serotonin\n2A receptor\nstimulator, an agonist,\nthat isn't psychedelic, that\nis therapeutic in psychiatry\nand the answer firmly is, no.\nI haven't seen it yet.\nWill they develop one?\nWell, for patients\nsake, I hope so.\nBecause it would be great.\nLet's wait and see.\nIf they do, I doubt\nit'll be psychedelic\nand I doubt it would have much\nto do with psychedelic therapy.\nAnd it would be much more\nlike the system we're used to\nof chronic pharmacotherapy.\nTake your drug every day.\nLet's hope they find it and\nit works for patients sake.\nBut as things stand right\nnow, I'm a little skeptical.\nNow, some of the\nfindings that are\nbeing seen that are\nreally exciting, fantastic\nwork being done, showing\nthings like increases\nin the communication\ncomponents of neurons,\ndendritic growth, spine\ngrowth, synaptic spine growth.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nby the way, folks,\njust I'll interrupt for\nnot necessarily spine--\nnot the cerebral\ncolumn but spines\nare these little\ntiny twigs with bulbs\non the end of neurons that\nallow for communication\npoints between neurons.\nSo neuroplasticity\nis often associated\nwith growth of\ndendrites and spines\nand so forth, which is\nwhat Robin's referring to.\nThat reminds me, and I\njust want to make sure\nthat we close the hatch\non the earlier answer,\nbecause I interrupted you.\nIs the increased\nconnectivity between--\nor communication\nbetween brain areas\nthat's observed while people\nare under the influence\nof the psychedelic\nalso observed later\nafter the effects of\nthe drug wear off?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd then I'll just\nthrow in another question there,\nbecause we're on to this topic\nnow.\nTo what extent do we think that\nneuroplasticity, structural\nchanges in neurons,\nfunctional changes in neurons\nare responsible for that?\nAnd how long does that last?\nLet's say I come\ninto your clinic,\nI'm a subject in your\nexperiment, I take--\ncome in the morning, I\ndo my psychedelic journey\nfive or six hours later.\nI'm parachuting back to\nreality, as we call it,\nand then I go home.\nIncrease connectivity\nlasts for how long,\nand how long are the structural\nbrain changes occurring?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWell, you're\nasking fantastic questions,\nand partly because we\ndon't have the answer yet.\nBut we do have some data.\nAnd so we have looked\nat, first of all,\nin a sense, the functional\nplasticity of what we assume\nit to be or at\nleast the functional\nchanges, the increase in\ncommunication across systems\nthat increase in\nglobal connectivity,\nfunctional connectivity.\nDo we see it after the trip?\nWe know we see it during the\ntrip pretty well replicated\ncorrelating with\nintense drug effects.\nDo we see it after the trip?\nWell the answer\nis, we've seen it\nin two different depression\ncohorts, psilocybin therapy\nfor depression.\nIn one study where we looked\nthe next day, we saw it.\nA kind of residual effect\nsimilar to what you see acutely\nbeing seen the next day.\nAnd then in a\nsubsequent study, we\nsaw it also three weeks later.\nSo we've seen it in two\nindependent data sets.\nThis decrease in modularity\nis how we measure it.\nIt's the same\nthing, essentially.\nBroadly speaking,\nit's the same thing.\nAn increase in\nglobal connectivity,\nfunctional connectivity.\nAnd actually,\nunpublished we've seen it\nin healthy volunteers on\na correlational level.\nNot on an absolute\nchange level, but if you\nlook at its relationship\nto a mental health outcome,\nand this is an important thing\nto stress with the depression\nwork, we saw a relationship\nbetween the magnitude\nof that change, the decrease\nin modularity or increase\nin global connectivity,\nand the improvement\nin symptom severity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So interesting.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And just\nto state it a different way,\nso what Robin is referring to\nis when you say modularity,\nas neuroscientists, we think of\nthe different modular networks\nof the brain.\nThe eye talks to a region\nof the thalamus involved\nin vision, which talks to the\nvisual cortex, which eventually\nconverges with auditory\ninformation, of course.\nBut there's a separation\nor modularity of function.\nThis increased connectivity\nis cross-modular\nin during the trip,\nbut afterwards as well.\nAnd you're saying that that\ncorrelates very strongly\nwith the strength of\nthe therapeutic outcome\nfor depression.\nI mean, the logical\nextension of that\nis that extreme modularity\nof brain function\nis depressive in some way.\nNow, we don't want\nto go too far,\nbut what does that\nmean that increasing\ncrosstalk between different\nmodules of the brain\nis so strongly correlated with\na positive therapeutic outcome?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWe don't other\nthan there's a relationship.\nI mean, this is the thing.\nWe need to be a little careful\nnot to run with it too far.\nI mean, there's some\nthings that it suggests.\nI think it suggests a more\nflexible mode of brain\nfunctioning, if you're not\ngetting stuck in modules\nor the modules\naren't excessively\ncut off from each other.\nBut you see different things\nwith different presentations\nif you were to\nlook at cognition.\nSharper cognition is\nactually associated\nwith more modularity.\nSo it's a rule that's\na little slippery.\nAnd we need to be\ncareful with it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Again,\nforgive me for interrupting,\nbut I think I have\nfriends who are--\nI would say, are\non the spectrum.\nWho are very linear\nin their thinking\nand extremely\nintelligent in the kind\nof classic sense of\nbeing able to ratchet\nthrough hard problems\nto arrive at a solution.\nAnd then I have\nfriends who are-- let's\njust call them what they are.\nFrom the creative communities\noutside of science\nthat are very expansive,\nthey see connections\nbetween many different\nthings, but sometimes, you\nhave to-- not all\nof them, but you\nhave to catch their ideas\nwith a butterfly net.\nAnd oftentimes, what\nthey're saying sometimes\nit just doesn't make any sense.\nNow, they also produce\nincredible creative works.\nBut to have a\nconversation with them\nis anything but a\nlinear experience.\nThey are not random\nthought generators,\nbut there's a non-linearity or\nrandomness to their processing\nthat's distinct from\nthese other folks\nthat I'm describing\non the spectrum.\nAnd of course, it's a spectrum.\nThere's a whole\nrange in between.\nIt sounds to me like there\nis some therapeutic value\nto being able to move along\nthis continuum from the more\nlinear to the nonlinear.\nIs that correct?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWell, I think so.\nYeah.\nIt's resonating\nwhat you're saying.\nIt's speaking to my intuition.\nThat you could be very\npassy, passing things up,\nchopping things up like an\nanalytical scientist like I'm\ndoing a bit.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A splitter\nas we say in science.\nYou're either a\nlumper or a splitter.\nYeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThe way I'm\nbeing very particular about when\nto call something psychedelic.\nThat kind of passy analytical\nway of thinking you\nmight associate with\na more modular system.\nWhereas the system that's\nmore globally, interconnected,\nand open, yeah.\nMight be more flexible\nand creative and divergent\nin the associations\nand so on so.\nYes.\nThat's speaking to my intuition\nto how you're describing it.\nAnd I imagine, if you take\nsevere psychopathology, severe\nmental illness\nlike a depression,\nI've always thought that\nthere's something intuitive\nabout the term itself.\nLike a depression in a\nlandscape, which is a halt.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nPhysical depression.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nA physical depression\nthat is easy to fall into.\nAnd if you do, it's\nhard to get out of.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So almost--\nif I understand what\nyou're saying correctly,\nalmost like getting stuck at\none location on this continuum.\nBecause most people don't\nreside at one extreme\nor the other full time.\nThey can kind of\nmigrate back and forth\nbetween expansive states\nand more linear states.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nLike you do with low mood.\nIf you're \"healthy\"\nin inverted commas,\nyou can feel your low\nmood, your disappointment.\nBut you can spring back.\nBut someone with--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And you\nknow you can spring back.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nWhereas the suicidal\ndepressive person or suicidally\ndepressed person, somehow,\nat least in my understanding,\nthere's something about that\nextreme depressive states\nand extreme anxiety states,\nsomething my laboratory is\na bit more familiar\nwith anxiety, which\nalters the perception of\ntime such that people feel\nlike that negative state\nis going to go on forever\nor that if it goes away, that\nit's going to return at random.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Kind\nof a vulnerability\nto the time domain.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nAnd it's so tragic, that\ncognitive bias in depression\nthat everything's\nhopeless and that there\nis no light at the\nend of the tunnel.\nYeah.\nYes.\nSo if you were to get stuck in\nthat rut and have that bias,\nthen you're cut off\nfrom other things,\nother sensory\nmodalities or modules,\ncut off from the world,\ncut off from other people.\nStuck in your inner rut.\nSo yes.\nI think we're sharing\nthis intuition\nthat a decrease in\nmodularity or an opening\nup of the system, the brain\ncould relate to an opening\nup of the mind that is enduring\nafter the psychedelic dosing\nsession.\nAnd yeah.\nAnd the third replication\nwas to see in healthies\nan improvement in well-being.\nBecause they're healthy, we\ndon't look at depression.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo these are people\nthat are healthy\nwalking into the trial?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Take\npsilocybin twice?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWell, actually they do.\nBut the first dose is\n1 milligram, which they\ndon't feel it's a placebo dose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Quote\nunquote, \"micro dose.\"\nYeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nWe stick EGG on their heads\nto measure their brainwaves\nduring each dose.\nAnd 1 milligram,\nyou see no change.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nthat, you microdosers.\nNo, I'm just kidding.\nI mean, nothing against\nthe micro doses.\nI've always just been\na little bit skeptical\nbased on my conversations\nwith the scientists\nactually doing the\nwork with psychedelics.\nIt seems like the answer\nkeeps coming back.\n1 or 2, maybe 3 macro doses\nin a controlled safe setting.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWell, that's compelling.\nThe evidence for\nthat is compelling.\nAnd that's what's making all\nthe difference right now.\nMicrodosing is just\nappealing, but again,\nscience isn't about\nwhat we want to believe,\nit's about what's\nactually coming through\nand what seems to\nhold up to testing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto just take a brief break\nand thank one of our\nsponsors, which is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means, plenty of salt--\nsodium, magnesium,\nand potassium,\nthe so-called\nelectrolytes and no sugar.\nNow, salt, magnesium,\nand potassium\nare critical to the function\nof all the cells in your body,\nin particular, to the function\nof your nerve cells, also\ncalled neurons.\nAnd we now know that\neven slight reductions\nin electrolyte concentrations\nor dehydration of the body\ncan lead to deficits in\ncognitive and physical\nperformance.\nLMNT contains a science-backed\nelectrolyte ratio\nof 1,000 milligrams, that's 1\ngram of sodium, 200 milligrams\nof potassium, and 60\nmilligrams of magnesium.\nI typically drink LMNT\nfirst thing in the morning\nwhen I wake up in order\nto hydrate my body\nand make sure I have\nenough electrolytes.\nAnd while I do any kind\nof physical training\nand after physical training\nas well, especially,\nif I've been sweating\na lot and certainly,\nI drink LMNT in my water\nwhen I'm in the sauna\nand after going in the\nsauna, because that\ncauses quite a lot of sweating.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT\nyou can go to drinklmnt--\nthat's L-M-N-T.com/huberman to\nclaim a free LMNT sample pack\nwith your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt--\nL-M-N-T.com/huberman.\nWould you say that's right?\nThat one or two or three\nsessions, and how far\napart are those\ntypically spaced in time?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nTypically, one to three\nweeks across the sites\nis the way people are doing\nthe psychedelic therapy\ndosing sessions.\nTwo sessions, you know,\nHopkins, Imperial, NYU.\nThat's been a kind\nof default to--\nwe actually use three\nin a current anorexia\ntrial, psilocybin\ntherapy for anorexia.\nTwo patients left\nto see after 19\nwho've gone through the trial.\nVery exciting results there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\nseeing an alleviation\nof the obsessive thought\nabout food and a willingness\nto consume healthier\namounts of food.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nEven improved weight\nat the long follow-up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So critical.\nWhen we did an episode\non eating disorders,\nI learned that anorexia\nnervosa, which by the way folks,\nthe rates are not increasing.\nIt's been pretty\nstable through time\ndespite what's said about\nsocial media, and et cetera.\nBut anorexia nervosa\nbeing the most\ndeadly of all\npsychiatric illnesses,\nwhich is a big statement,\nbecause manic depression,\nso-called bipolar depression,\nhas a 20 to 30 times\nthe typical suicide rate.\nBasically, many people with\nanorexia, I think is how it's--\nis what one says, not anorexics.\nBut people with\nanorexia often die.\nMany of them die.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nSo tragic.\nSo often young people as well.\nAnd similarly, with suicide\nin terms of premature death.\nSo the tragedy with\npsychiatry is so strong.\nIt's so rewarding to\nbe doing that trial\nand to be seeing good results.\nI have to check\nmyself a little bit\nthat I'm reporting on it in\nthis really promisory way\nand the trial isn't yet\npublicly released and published.\nSo it's still ongoing as well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nthat was three sessions.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nIt is three sessions.\nAnd I can't say what the dosage\nis, because we still have--\nthere is a blinding component.\nBut there are three\ndosing sessions in there.\nLet's see now.\nI think they're two weeks\napart and we do the follow-up.\nYes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd\nlike to close out\nthis description of the\njourney and the trip\nby extending past the\nday when people actually\ntake the drug into this--\nwhat I've described\nas the integration phase.\nYou have to re-integrate.\nAll this increased connectivity\nduring the session.\nHallucinations, insights,\nanxiety, letting go.\nMaybe revelation,\nmaybe epiphany.\nOK.\nGreat.\nAt what point is\nthat consolidated?\nMeaning, are these\npatients or subjects\nin studies having\ndaily conversation\nwith their therapist?\nAre they journaling every day?\nAnd I want to keep in mind\nthat most people are not going\nto be part of a clinical trial.\nAnd of course, here\nwe're not suggesting\nwhat people do or not do.\nBut let's just put it this way.\nWere people to use psychedelics,\nwhat is the way that people can\nmaximize on the neuroplasticity\nand the brain changes\nin a positive way in the\ndays and weeks afterwards?\nIn other words, how long does\nthis so-called integration\nlast?\nAnd how far can we take this?\nI mean, I could imagine\nthat how often one\nchooses to think\nabout the insights\ncould also have an impact.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right?\nBecause clearly people\nwent to raves, clearly\npeople did psychedelics\nin the '60s.\nWe don't know if clearly\npeople do psychedelics now.\nBut we don't have\ndata on those people.\nYou have access to the\nunderstanding of how they're\nspending their time and\nthe therapeutic outcomes,\nwhich we haven't gotten to\nthe numbers yet, but again,\nare incredibly impressive.\nIn upwards of, as\nI understand it,\n60% or more people getting\nrelief from depression.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\n70%, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 70%.\nIncredible, especially\nwhen compared\nto the typical antidepressant\ntreatments and so on.\nSo what is this\nbusiness of integration?\nHow is it done properly?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nGosh.\nWell, how long does\nit last as well?\nA lifetime?\nYou know?\nLife is a journey like\na trip is a journey.\nAnd there's always work to do.\nAs Jack Kornfield says, after\nthe, ecstasy the laundry.\nAnd you know?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nThere'll be other good ones\nas well, but forget them.\nBut yeah.\nSo the work is\nongoing, and yeah.\nBut this gives you a foot up.\nIt enables people to do the work\nmore easily, and that's true.\nThe classic psychedelics\nis also true.\nVery true of MDMA therapy for\npost-traumatic stress disorder.\nIt's really giving you a\nleg up, making it easier\nto do very, very difficult\nwork going back to a trauma.\nTrying to digest it,\nprocess it, integrate it.\nSo it's such an\nessential component\nof the treatment model.\nBut one has to be realistic\nas well by saying, oh,\nintegration lasts a lifetime.\nWell, people\ndelivering a service\ncan't be there for a lifetime.\nSo what's the answer there?\nAnd people are wrestling\nwith that issue right now.\nAnd I think one of the solutions\nmight be that it's, in a sense,\non you to appoint.\nThe therapeutic team\ncan treat you to a point\nand then it becomes what\nyou might call practice.\nIn a similar way, that\nmeditation is a practice.\nIt's something that\nyou have to keep up.\nAnd if it slips, then\nthings could slip.\nAnd that's the way it is.\nOr you have another\npsychedelic treatment.\nSo people have even used\nthis term of practice\nin relation to\npsychedelics, where\nthere's a psychedelic practice\nlike there's a meditation\npractice.\nBut I'm using meditation\nintentionally here because they\nactually think that\nmeditative practice, elements\nof spiritual practice could\nbe a very important complement\nto psychedelic therapy.\nAnd I think it's probably\ndoing something similar\nin terms of promoting\nan ability to sit with--\na former colleague of\nmine said it quite well.\nIn relation to\npsychedelic therapy\nversus chronic\npharmacotherapy or like SSRIs\nbeing on them all the time.\nSays psychedelic\ntherapy allows you\nto sit with rather than sit on.\nAnd so that's quite good.\nYeah.\nSo the meditation, the\nmindfulness, the ability to,\nyes, be present-centered\nbut also present-centered\nand accepting so\nif things come up,\nyou can watch and\nprocess and then let go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nHoly Grail of mindfulness.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Awareness\nwithout reactivity, respond.\nI grew up in the\nBay Area and you'd\nhear this language, right?\nAnd I'm not being\ndisparaging this.\nI have friends that are on\nthe board of Esalen and work\ndown there.\nAnd I've gone there.\nAnd yet you hear\nthese terms, right?\nBe responsive, not reactive,\nwhich to a neuroscientist\nis like grates on me,\nwhich probably just means\nI have issues.\nAnd surely, I do.\nBut what does that mean?\nIt's saying like, oh,\nto be the observer\nbut not be drawn\ninto the experience.\nAnd again, I don't want\nto be overly reductionist,\nbut what I find so compelling\nabout the emerging data,\nbecause it really is data,\non psychedelics as treatments\nfor depression and trauma,\nnamely psilocybin and MDMA\nis that it really seems to\nallow people this space that\nis so commonly thrown around.\nGiving space between\nstimulus and reaction.\nViktor Frankl talked about this.\nBut I've been reading\na wonderful book\ncalled The Prince of Medicine.\nDates back to the\norigins of medicine.\nVery dense book.\nPeople have been\ntalking about this stuff\nand thinking about this\nstuff for thousands of years.\nPsychedelics seem to give people\naccess to that better version\nof self, which is remarkable.\nWhat's also remarkable, it's,\nperhaps, worth pointing out\nis that, five years\nago, I never would\nhave been comfortable\nhaving this conversation.\nI would have been\nafraid to lose my job.\nStanford Magazine, this week,\njust published an entire issue\nabout psychedelics with\nhow ketamine works, MDMA,\npsilocybin with the appropriate\ncautionary notes in there.\nBut clearly, times are changing.\nSpeaking of which, I know you're\ndoing a trial on first-time use\nof psychedelics.\nWhat inspired that?\nAnd what are you observing?\nAnd as you tell us\nthat, please give us\na few of the key contours.\nWhat's the dose, how\nold are these subjects?\nI'm assuming it's men, women.\nAre they suffering\nfrom depression or not?\nWhat's the landscape\nof that study?\nAnd I realize this is still\nearly days of the study\nor maybe it's close\nto completion.\nIt's not yet published,\nhowever, correct?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's not\npublished, it's not submitted,\nit is completed.\nSo this was another one of\nour COVID studies, in a sense,\nmeaning COVID hit and we\nhad to finish the study.\nAnd it was hard to finish\nthe study because of COVID.\nThat was true of our psilocybin\ntherapy versus escitalopram.\nLexapro trial, which is\npublished in The New England\nJournal of Medicine.\nBut the--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This was '20--\nthat paper, by the way, folks,\nwe'll provide a link to\nin the show note captions\nas well as some of\nRobin's other papers.\nI think the 2022 New England\nJournal paper is really\nfabulous given the different\ndosages and the comparison\nto, essentially,\nwhat is microdosing\nand the comparison\nto citalopram.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nYeah.\nThat's interesting\nthat you link the way\nwe gave small doses of\npsilocybin to microdosing.\nWe didn't think of it that way.\nWe thought it was just\na necessary placebo\nfor the big dose,\nthe 25 milligrams.\nYeah.\nSo that we could say to everyone\nwe're giving you psilocybin\nand not be lying.\nYeah.\nFor those who got escitalopram,\nLexapro for six weeks,\nthey got a very, very\nlow dose of psilocybin.\nBut it allowed us to standardize\nall the psychotherapy and so\non.\nBut the other study\nthat you're referring to\nwas in healthy volunteers.\nMiddle-aged.\nAverage age, I think, was 40.\nSo not your typical\nstudent study\nthat is so often the case\nin psychology research.\nAll the undergrads end up\nvolunteering for your study.\nSo this is more of an\nage range and also--\nI think it was an equal\nproportion of male and female.\nAll the staff\nactually were female,\nwhich the staff were\nvery proud of them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Although,\nit produces its own potential\nconfound, right?\nTo become all one sex of staff.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Possibly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: They\ndid a good job in the sense\nthat we saw significant\nimprovements in well-being\nat the end of the trial.\nSo let me describe the design.\nIt was a repeated measures\ndesign, meaning people come in,\nyou collect your baseline\ndata and do a brain scan,\nand you give people a placebo.\nWe gave people a placebo.\nAnd actually let me\nrewind a little bit.\nEveryone's healthy volunteers,\nmiddle-aged never taken\na psychedelic in their life.\nNone of them.\nEntirely fresh, virgin\npeople coming in.\nAnd the plan is to give them\ntheir first ever psychedelic\nexperience.\nSo that's what we\ndid in this study.\nBut to do it, we have this\nrepeated measures design where\nthey'll first get a placebo.\nAnd we have the\nplacebo so that we\ncan do all the procedures,\nall the therapy, all the music\nlistening but not give a\nwhopping dose of psilocybin.\nAgain, we gave them a\nplacebo dose of psilocybin.\n1 milligram.\nWe stick EEG headsets\non during the experience\nto record the brain activity\nfrom the scalp, the oscillating\nelectrical activity.\nAnd we do the MRI scanning\nbefore and after to see deeper\ninto the brain, and we can look\nat the functional connectivity\nthat we were referring to\nearlier, and also properties\nof brain anatomy, which\nwe did in this study.\nSo the short story is that\nall of the changes that we\nsaw both psychologically\nand neurobiologically\nwere seen with\nthe 25 milligrams.\nIt all happened with\nthat big whopping dose.\nAnd what did we see?\nWell, we did see\nsignificant improvements\nin psychological well-being.\nWe saw what I call the entropic\nbrain effect, which is actually\nformerly quite accurate.\nWe see an increase in the\ninformational complexity\nof ongoing brain activity\nrecorded with the EEG\non the dose of psilocybin.\nThe activity becomes\nmore complex.\nIt's harder to\npredict across time.\nIt's more informationally rich.\nAnd that effect\ncorrelates as it does\nvery reliably with the magnitude\nof the subjective effect.\nSo the bigger the trip, the\nbigger this entropic brain\neffect.\nNow, pretty well\nreplicated finding.\nBut then the MRI, seeing\ndeep into the brain\nwas probably our\nmost exciting result\nwhere we didn't just see some\nfunctional brain changes,\nbut we've seen some anatomical\nbrain changes as well.\nAnd we used a technique called\ndiffusion tensor imaging that\nlooks at the cabling of the\nbrain, the white matter tracts.\nAnd we saw a change\nin major tracts.\nSo we limited our search\nspace to really thick tracts.\nReally thick fibers.\nAnd the fibers that\ncame through as changing\nwere ones that traveled\nbetween the prefrontal cortex\nand the thalamus\nand the striatum.\nThere were two tracks, two\nprefrontal tracks that changed.\nAnd they changed in the\ndirection of a decrease\nin axial diffusivity,\nwhich could be interpreted\nas tract integrity where\na decrease would be\nan increase in tract integrity.\nIt is something that you\nsee in the developing brain.\nThe axial diffusivity\ndecreases as the brain goes\nfrom being a baby\nto being an adult.\nAxial diffusivity goes down.\nAnd then in aging and\npathologies of aging,\naxial diffusivity goes up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This is\nin the opposite direction\nof the results you talked\nabout earlier in terms\nof brain connectivity\nof increased\ncommunication across areas.\nIf I understand\ncorrectly, and I'm\nperfectly happy to be wrong,\nby the way, that this decrease\nin axial diffusivity\ntranslates to a higher\nfidelity of communication\nbetween the prefrontal cortex\nand the thalamus and\nstriatum as opposed to less.\nAnd your description\nof this as somewhat\nlike the transition from\nbabyhood and childhood\nto adulthood.\nSpeaks to the same where\nwe know that there's\na massive culling of\nconnections as opposed\nto growth of connections.\nSo in other words,\nas we get older,\nwe get better at\ndoing certain things\nand less good at doing\npotentially most everything\nelse.\nIs that right?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Ish.\nBecause the change was\nanatomical and not functional.\nSo the other stuff was is\nreally measuring communication\nin the brain by looking at\nhow the activity fluctuates\nacross time and whether those\nfluctuations in activity\nare synchronous between regions.\nAnd if they are, we say\nthey're functionally connected.\nAnd we infer that they're\ntalking to each other,\nbecause they go up\nand down in synchrony.\nBut when it comes\nto the anatomy,\nwe're talking about the\njust static material stuff.\nAnd so we're seeing the fibers\nand a property of the fibers\nchange.\nAt least that's what we think.\nAnd recently, we had\nan independent person\ncome in and reanalyze the data,\nbecause one of those things,\nincredible finding\nrequires credible evidence,\nreally strong evidence.\nAnd I would say, the evidence\nat the moment is one study.\nSo we need to be\ncautious on that.\nBut we did re-analyze it\nand use this correction\nprocedure-free water correction\nto be more sure that it\nwas a change in the\nactual microstructure\nrather than something to do\nwith the extracellular space.\nThe water surrounding\nthe fibers.\nAnd it came through.\nIn fact, the change\nwas strengthened\nby doing this correction step.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthis is neuroplasticity\nas the consequence of one\nfirst time session with 25\nmilligrams of psilocybin.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nSo we're excited and the two--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nUnderstandably so.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: --the two\ndifferent-- the second analyst\ncoming in wasn't\nsure she believed it\nand then she thought this\ncorrection technique might\nkill the result and then it came\nthrough, and she's like, OK.\nNow, I'm excited too.\nSo we'll see.\nWe don't know what it means.\nWhat does it mean functionally?\nWe don't know.\nHow did the people change?\nWell, psychologically, as I\nsaid, well-being improved.\nWe did look at their\ncognition, and we\nused a cognitive\nflexibility paradigm that\nlooks at people's ability\nto notice a rule change\nand then flexibly adapt their\nbehavior based on noticing\nthis rule change and people\nimproved after the 25\nmilligrams and didn't\nsignificantly improve\nafter the placebo dose.\nThere weren't correlations with\nthe DTI change, the cabling\nchange and these\npsychological outcomes.\nBut with these studies\nand smaller sample sizes,\nyou don't always see those\ncorrelations come through.\nSo it's something.\nWe don't know what it means.\nBut it's a change\nin brain anatomy\nthat's in the opposite\ndirection to what\nyou see in an aging brain\nor with pathology of aging.\nAnd it's what you see\nin a healthy brain\nas it goes from normal\nneurodevelopment\ninto adulthood.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Very, very\nexciting and intriguing.\nAnd I appreciate\nthat you highlighted\nthat it's just one study,\nalthough from everything you've\nsaid, it sounds like it's\nbeen done with immense rigor.\nSo we will eagerly await the\npublication of that study\nso we can peruse all the data\nand the subsequent studies.\nI want to hear a\nbit about the study\nthat you have been carrying\nout on the use of psilocybin\nfor the treatment\nof fibromyalgia.\nI'm intrigued by\nfibromyalgia, because I\nhave a good friend who also--\nI won't reveal who it is.\nNo.\nIt's not me.\nThis isn't the \"I\nhave a friend thing.\"\nWho also is a scientist who\nsits at a fairly high position\nin the National Institutes\nof Health who quietly\nhas expressed to me\nthat they are incredibly\nfrustrated with the fact that\nthe standard medical community\nhas largely ignored\nfibromyalgia.\nAnd that for many years, it was\nlumped with things like chronic\nfatigue syndrome and\nother so-called--\nagain, so-called.\nI'm not saying this.\nBut people often\nrefer to these as, oh.\nIt's psychosomatic.\nThat's all in your head.\nWhich, as a neuroscientist, is\na ridiculous statement to hear,\nbecause it's all in your head.\nYour brain is in\nyour head after all.\nYour physiology\nand your psychology\nare influencing each other.\nOf course.\nAnd the world is starting\nto appreciate that more.\nBut first of all,\nmaybe you could\ntell people what\nfibromyalgia is,\nwhat inspired you to do\na study on fibromyalgia\nusing psilocybin of all\nthings because that's\nsurprising to me.\nAnd if you are allowed\nto or if you have access\nto the data in\nmind, share with us\na little bit about what you're\ndiscovering in that study.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure.\nYeah.\nHappy to.\nSo again, it's psilocybin\ntherapy and the population\nis fibromyalgia syndrome.\nSo this is people\npresenting with\na generalized chronic pain.\nSo unlike some\nother pain disorders\nwhere the pain is focused.\nYou can say, it's my lower\nback, which is very common.\nChronic lower back pain.\nThis is more generalized.\nAnd for that reason, it's\nhard to know what it is.\nAnd that's why it's been a\ncontroversial space in medicine\nand it's been-- yeah.\nIt's had that charge thrown\nat it that maybe it's\npsychosomatic, and\njust to your point,\nis anything ever independent\nof the mind, anyway.\nBut this is actually\na fascinating space\nfor how subjective experience,\nthe lived experience,\nand the mind can\ninfluence the body.\nBecause there's some really\ninteresting literature\naround the etiology.\nHow the pain has come about.\nIn a sense like what\ncaused the pain.\nWhat's the story there?\nAnd the head of the trial, I\nwould say to my colleagues,\nlet's just be careful.\nBecause there is some\nfascinating literature\naround things like a\nbackground of trauma\nand how that can relate to\nissues related to inflammation\nand how that can\nexpress into things\nlike fibromyalgia syndrome.\nI just said, be\nvery careful there,\nbecause if you go in\nwith an assumption\nthat there's some buried\ntrauma, for example,\nthen there's that\nwhole other side\nof psychoanalysis that\nmassively tripped it up\naround false memory and so on.\nAnd so please don't\nhold prior assumptions\nthat you're going to uncover\nburied trauma in every case.\nNow, the team of\ntreated, I think,\neight people and it\nis going very well.\nAgain, I just want to\nbe careful with how\nI describe it to manage\nexpectations and not\nget too carried away.\nBut I check in with\nthe team every week,\nand they're still based\nin London doing the work.\nAnd it's remarkable what I hear\nabout the profound experiences\nthat people have under the drug.\nIn this study, we\nonly give one dose.\nIt's a very mechanistic study.\nWe actually have the EEG\ncap on in the sessions\nlike in the healthy\nvolunteer study,\nbut this time now taking it\ninto a clinical population.\nAnd--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So they\nare wearing an eye mask\nunder the influence of 25\nmilligrams of psilocybin.\nMost of them probably have\nnot done psilocybin before.\nSo it's a little bit like the\nfirst time study in some sense.\nThey have fibromyalgia that's\ndebilitating in some way.\nThey don't want it, obviously.\nAnd during the session, are\nthey thinking about their pain?\nAre they being told to\nthink about their pain?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThey're not\nbeing told to think\nabout the pain.\nIn fact, as I understand it,\nwhile there is a therapeutic\nmodel around acceptance\nof the pain, it isn't--\nunlike some of\nthe PTSD work, you\naren't encouraging them to\nfocus on the index trauma\nand then work through it\nand try and digest it.\nWe don't do that with the pain.\nSo the pain is there, but\nthere isn't an invitation\nto focus on it.\nAnd that's probably\none of the differences\nwith classic psychedelic\ntherapy versus MDMA therapy.\nArguably, MDMA therapy is\nmore like it's a bit closer\nto traditional talk therapy\nwhere there is more dialogue.\nPeople are able to talk on MDMA.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In\nthe MDMA trials, do you\nknow whether or not\nthey used eye masks or--\nbecause this seems to be\nan important distinction\nbetween, as you described,\nthe therapeutic trip\nversus the trip that one\ndoes going into the woods\nand taking psilocybin in\nthe woods or at a party\nor while staring at\na poster or a leaf.\nAgain, I'm not trying to\ntrivialize those experiences.\nI mean, obviously,\nthey can be profound.\nSo I'm told.\nBut the MDMA trials\nseem to involve,\nas you said, more\ndirected dialogue.\nAnd sometimes, even\nempathic connection\nbetween people by\nthey're actually\nlooking at one another,\nthe eyes and eye contact\nbeing such a key part of\nthe human social cognitive\nconnective networks.\nSo do you know if they\nput eye masks on people\nduring the therapeutic session?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nI'm pretty sure that they\nhave the eye masks there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nBecause a lot of\nthe MDMA work, and I\nwas part of an MDMA trial.\nWas, as I understand\ngeared toward developing,\nbecause it's an empathogen\nempathy toward the self.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nI'm pretty sure they\nhave the eye masks there,\nbut they probably-- and\nit's a great question,\nbecause you could\nformally test this.\nIt probably don't\nuse them as much.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Mhm.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: The\nthing is with the classic\npsychedelics, if you're\nlooking at your guides\nor your facilitators and\ntheir faces are melting or--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOn MDMA, you just\nmight really start to feel\nmore connected to you.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nThey might look especially\nbeautiful and you know--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: sure.\nYeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: And yeah.\nThere's that fascinating\neffect of loving the people\nthat you're with.\nAnd so yeah.\nI imagine they talk more\nand use the eye shades less.\nAnd it is more interpersonal\nrather than like intrapersonal\nor going inside.\nThey do use a\nfascinating terminology\nthat some people have critiqued,\nbut it is a very interesting\nphenomenon.\nAnd it's this notion\nof the inner healer.\nThey use that language a lot.\nIt's been critiqued because\nit sounds very suggestive.\nYou know?\nAnd that's probably one\nof the vehicles here.\nDriving the therapeutic\nprocess is suggestion.\nI think we have to\nbe honest about that.\nSo when they go inside,\nthat's another term\nthat we use very much in the\nclassic psychedelic therapy\nwork.\nYou go inside.\nYou put the eyeshades\non, and people\nare encouraged to go inside.\nBut when they do that\nin the MDMA work,\nespecially, they might\nbe told explicitly\nand listen to the inner\nhealer and that language.\nSo you could see how\na cynic or a skeptic\ncould come in and see that as\nsome kind of like suggestive\npriming or biasing.\nI think they have a point.\nSkeptics often do, but I don't\nthink it's all of the story.\nAnd just briefly, because\nit's an interesting point,\nspeaking to that point\na bit in our psilocybin\ntherapy versus\nescitalopram trial,\nwe measured\npre-trial expectancy.\nAnd we did it for\nboth conditions.\nSo what kind of\nimprovement do you\nexpect with the Lexapro,\nthe escitalopram\nat the end of the trial?\nAnd what kind of improvement if\nyou go into the psilocybin arm\nand get two big\ndoses of psilocybin.\nWhat kind of improvement do you\nthink you'll see in that arm?\nAnd of course, it\nwas a coin flip\nas to what arm people went into\nand there was no crossover.\nWhat we found was that it was\ntrue that we had a sample bias,\nso most people had higher\nexpectation stations.\nOn average, there were higher\nexpectations for psilocybin\nand its efficacy\nor effectiveness\nversus the SSRI, the Lexapro.\nHowever, when we looked\nat the correlation\nor the predictive relationship\nbetween pre-trial expectancy\nand response, we saw\nthat pre-trial expectancy\nfor the escitalopram\npredicted response\nto escitalopram across virtually\nevery single measure, all\nthese different measures\nof depression and anxiety\nand well-being, and I\nthink none of the scales.\nI'm pretty sure it was none of\nabout 12 or so mental health\nrating scales.\nWas there a relationship\nbetween pre-trial expectancy?\nEven though it was high,\nit didn't predict--\npre-trial expectancy\ndidn't predict response\nto the psilocybin therapy.\nSo that was a bit of a smash\non the head for the idea\nthat the classic\npsychedelic therapy is\nsome kind of placebo response.\nAnd I think it's so important\nto address that question.\nBecause if it\ndoesn't come through\nas it didn't come\nthrough, then it\nopens up even more intrigue\nabout, well, what is it then?\nIf it's not just a placebo\nresponse or a super placebo\nresponse like an amplification\nof the placebo response,\nthen it must be something else.\nAnd how intriguing?\nIt has a direct\ntherapeutic action.\nIt must be something.\nAnd we don't yet\nknow what it is.\nI talked about the\nresidual increase\nin global connectivity.\nThat's one possibility.\nBut the truth is, we're\njust scratching the surface.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And yet\nthe therapeutic outcomes\nare, again, just so\nmarvelously impressive.\nI'm curious as to why as--\nwell, there are that many labs.\nBut the laboratories that are\nfocused on classic psychedelics\nfor the treatment of\ndepression and now as you\nmentioned, promising results\nfor anorexia and fibromyalgia\nas well.\nAlthough preliminary\nvery promising.\nWhy the lack of\nattention toward LSD?\nIs it that the LSD\ntrips are just too long?\nIs it that they are\nqualitatively different?\nAre there any data on\nnon-microdoses of LSD?\nAnd here I want to\nbe very careful,\nbecause I learned through my\ninteractions on social media\nthat this term microdose\nis very misleading.\nAnd in some cases, can be\ndangerously misleading,\nbecause, as you\nmentioned earlier,\nthe effective\npsychedelic dose or the--\neffective meaning\nthat can induce\na real trip with hallucinations,\net cetera, of LSD\nis actually in the\nmicrogram range.\nSo some people hear microdose,\nand they think microgram of LSD\nis a-- micrograms is a\nmicrodose when, in fact,\na macrodose of LSD can be\nmeasured in micrograms, right?\nSo this is where in the\nabsence of scientific training,\npeople can really go astray.\nOr even just in lack\nof understanding\nof the metric system.\nAnd since now you're a\nrecent arrival to the US,\nfortunate for us.\nSorry.\nEngland's loss is\nthe US's gain by--\nRobbins Lab moved from England\nto the United States recently.\nSo score 1 for us.\nBut why isn't there more\nuse of LSD in these trials?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nI think it probably\nis the duration of the trip.\nIt used to be stigma\nand it was easier\nto get your psilocybin\nstudy through,\nbecause others were, they\nwere getting that through.\nSo there was the likes of\nFranz Vollenweider in Zurich\nin Switzerland and\nthen Roland Griffiths\ncoming along and doing the\npsilocybin work at Hopkins.\nSo you could appeal\nto that precedence\nand say, well, they're\ndoing it over there.\nCan we not do it\nin little England?\nSo that's how it worked for us.\nWe did actually go on\nand do an LSD study\nonce we'd laid the foundations\nfor doing this kind of work.\nAnd it was a brain\nimaging study.\nIt was a really\nextensive one actually\nwhere we used both MRI\nand another modality\ncalled MEG, sort of\nsuper EEG in a sense.\nBut you know, why didn't\nthat turn our heads\nto think, oh, should we not\nbe doing our trials with LSD?\nIt does have something\nto do with the pragmatics\nlike a study day with\npsilocybin is long enough.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nfour to six-hour trip?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd the FDA asked us to\nhave the people in the lab\nuntil eight hours post-dose,\nwhich personally I think\ncould be quite excessive,\nespecially if it's a low dose.\nAnd if you have that in the\nplacebo condition as well,\nit becomes impractical.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nScientists are not\npaid nearly enough\nto warrant the-- there's\nno such thing as overtime\nfor the graduate\nstudents and postdocs.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nIt's often those\nmore junior members\nthat are doing that\nreally hard work.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It was\ndescribed very well to me\nby a student when I was-- a\ngraduate student said to me,\nthey really can't afford\nto pay us by the hour.\nBecause we used to work.\nHe was a electrophysiologist,\nso he would run experiments.\nNo joke, folks.\nThree to five-day experiments.\nSleeping in bouts of\ntwo hours here or there\nin a dark room with a bunch\nof equipment and recordings.\nSo these are long, long\nacute electrophysiological\nrecordings.\nSo yeah.\nNo scientist does it for\nthe money, I promise you.\nThere is money in\npharma, there is not\nmoney in personal income.\nIt's not lucrative for\nthe basic scientist.\nSo yes.\nLSD is what?\nAnywhere from 8 to 15\nhours, something like that.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\n15 would be a little long.\nYou'd be a bit worried\nif you were still\ntripping at that time, maybe\nwith a really big dose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oops.\nNo.\nJust kidding.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nEight hours plus-- and\ndose dependent, yeah.\nIf it's a bigger dose,\nit's a longer experience.\nBut if you're going\nto dose say, 10:00 AM\nin the morning, which is more\nor less how it often goes, then\nthat's 6:00 PM still\nfeeling the effects.\nAnd then how long do you\nwait now to close things out\nbefore they can go home.\nEven with psilocybin, you\nhave people still at work\ninto the evening.\nAnd the staff are\nalways there later,\nof course, because they've\ngot to pack up and yeah.\nSo these are long days.\nAnd it's too much, you know?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat makes sense.\nPractical constraints.\nI learned from a recent\nguest on this podcast\nthat we recorded with,\nDr. Satchin Panda who\nis a colleague of mine when I\nwas down at the Salk Institute.\nPioneered a lot\nof the studies on\nso-called intermittent fasting.\nThat the reason that the eating\nperiod in these studies--\nin animals and now\non humans is 8 hours,\nthe feeding window\nin these studies\nis because the graduate student\nwas going to, otherwise,\nlose their relationship.\nBecause their significant\nother says, listen,\nyou can be in the lab\nfor 12 hours, that\nmeant some hours before the\nexperiment, then 8 hours,\nand then some hours afterwards.\nBut you can't stay\nin there longer.\nAnd many people use the\neight-hour feeding window\nas a consequence.\nSo the scientist has to\nexist and be carried out\nin real-world frame.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It does.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It does.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: MDMA is a\nlittle bit shorter, right?\nIt's about a four to--\nit's also about four\nto six hours, correct?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nIt's kind of similar\nto psilocybin.\nYeah.\nIt is.\nAnd actually, in\nthe maps work, they\nredose after a certain point.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The booster.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: They have\na booster or optional booster,\nyeah.\nSo there is that.\nAnd now, people\nare thinking, well,\neven the psilocybin sessions\nare long and expensive.\nAnd if you have to have\ntwo staff members there\nall the time, that's expensive.\nThat's where most\nof the expense is.\nIs in the staffing.\nSo can we abridge the\nexperience, make it shorter,\nand get away with it, and get\nsimilar therapeutic outcomes?\nSo there's a lot of\ninterest in that direction.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMay I ask about--\nsorry to interrupt,\nbut I want to make sure\nI don't forget to ask about\ncombination psilocybin MDMA\ntherapies.\nThe reason I ask about this is--\nand here, truly\nnot me, but I know\npeople who do\nself-administered combination\npsilocybin and MDMA.\nI think I heard this right.\nI think it's called\na hippy flip.\nThere's another one\nthat involves LSD too.\nAgain, I'm not suggesting people\ndo these drug combinations.\nBut the way it was\ndescribed to me\nwas that the psilocybin,\nbecause it's so serotonergic,\nsometimes can be not a downer\nbut can have a bit of kind\nof a murky feel to it.\nSome real deep\nintrospection, sometimes\nin the darker realms of one's\npsyche depressive thoughts,\net cetera.\nNot that it necessarily stays\nthat way throughout the trip,\nbut that the MDMA,\nbecause it has\na very strongly serotonergic\nbut also dopaminergic--\nI mean, it has an\namphetamine component.\nCocaine-like, in fact.\nIf you've ever seen\nsomeone on MDMA,\ntheir pupils are about\nthe size of a quarters.\nFor a reason, they're\nextreme autonomic arousal\ncompared to a sedative,\nwhich by the way,\nwould constrict the pupils.\nSo they describe the use\nof MDMA to balance out\nthe affect component of it.\nWhat are your thoughts on\ncombination psilocybin MDMA?\nDoes this hold any\ntherapeutic potential?\nThis is, obviously, backyard\nchemistry in the sense\nthat people are cowboying\nthis stuff on their own,\nwhich again, I don't\nreally recommend.\nI'd like to see the\nscience go first,\nbut I understand this is how\nit works in the real world.\nYeah.\nWhat are your thoughts\non combining compounds?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nWell, I guess, they're cowboying\nit in recreational context,\nbut also underground therapists\ndo work with this combo.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\nwhat I'm referring to.\nSo I'm not talking about people\npartying with this stuff.\nI'm talking about there are\nthousands now of therapists\nthat offer psychedelic\ntherapies illegally,\nreally, because it's not\nlegal at least, not in the US,\nto possess or sell.\nBut that are doing this.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's\nreally why I'm asking.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd I think there's\nsomething to be said for--\none has to be careful\nwith this as a scientist.\nBut if they're doing\nit, are they using\nsome kind of trial and error?\nThe same is true, of\ncourse, with longer history\nof psychedelic plant\nmedicine use if by plants, we\ninclude the fungi as well.\nSo in the extended sense plants.\nThere will have been\ntrial and error there.\nIt might not be as systematic\nas the science we do today,\nbut maybe there's been\na learning process.\nAnd maybe what they\ndo, they've come\nto because they found it works.\nSo by that principle, I'm\ninterested in that combination\nand whether it does offer\nsome advantages, maybe,\nin certain patients.\nOne of the buzz\nterms in medicine\nthese days is\nprecision medicine.\nA precision medicine and\npersonalized medicine.\nSo maybe there are\ncertain cases where\nintroducing say, psilocybin\nafter the MDMA or the other way\naround could offer\nsome advantages.\nAnd the differences\nare interesting.\nPsilocybin can get\nyou to deep places.\nMaybe the kernel of your\nsuffering and major life\nexperiences and complexes\nthat are causally\nlinked to whatever the pathology\nthat you're presenting with.\nBut it can do it, sometimes,\nquite aggressively.\nAnd if it say, post-traumatic\nstress disorder,\nit can be overwhelming.\nAnd you can fight it.\nAnd really, it's that.\nThe resistance is\nreally challenged,\nand they fight back.\nAnd the therapeutic\nbreakthrough and the progress\nisn't happening because\nyou've agitated the defense\nmechanisms.\nWhereas what MDMA offers\nis something arguably\nmore directionally reliable\nin terms of the valence.\nIt's more directionally positive\ngenerally, an MDMA experience.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Hard to\nhave a bad time on MDMA.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: To be\nquite blunt, I mean.\nBut one of the concerns\nI had with MDMA,\nI've never done\nit recreationally.\nI have had not and have not\never done it recreationally.\nBut when it was done in\nthis therapeutic setting,\nI realized, because there was\na music on at the beginning,\nI actually asked\nthem to turn it off,\nbecause I realized that\nthe music was becoming\nsuch an attractor\nto my attention\nthat I suddenly was starting\nto think about music\nand my love of\nmusic, which was not\nthe focus of the session\nthat was there for.\nAnd I'm glad that they\ndid turn the music off,\nbecause the moment\nthey did, I was\nable to drop in within the eye\nmask to this sort of go inward\nand address some certain\nissues that at least to me\nfelt key and productive.\nSo that seems to be the\nkind of hazard with MDMA.\nIs that it's such an empathogen\nthat one could start to-- you\ncould go down any number\nof different rabbit holes.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nBut it's also-- it's a\nstrength, because you well,\nthe classics like psilocybin\ncan take you there very reliably\nbut maybe a bit aggressively.\nMDMA makes it\neasier to go there.\nAnd that's its strength.\nAnd that's why that marriage\nof MDMA therapy for PTSD,\nin particular, is a good combo.\nIt works, because you\nare going to go there.\nIn a sense, you have to really\nmake the therapeutic progress.\nYou're going to have\nto go back there.\nBut we're going to set it up\nso that you can go back there\nand feel safer and\nmore trusting and be\nable to go back there whereas\nyou've never, otherwise,\nbeen able to go back there\nwithout dissociating or having\nhorrible flashbacks and so on.\nSo that's the strength\nthat it offers.\nI guess the limitation\nwould be that, maybe, it\ndoesn't take you as deep as\nthe classic psychedelics.\nAnd I tend to think\nI'm biased on this one,\nthat there's a kind of\nhonesty to the classics\nin that it is hell\nas well as heaven.\nAnd that's the psyche.\nIt isn't all roses.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nreally appreciate\nthat you bring that up.\nBecause I think that\nthere's such a fear\nof so-called bad trips.\nThere's such a fear in\nnon-psychedelic states\nto avoid the painful and\neverything we know from trauma\nand the treatment of trauma.\nAnd we've had several\nguests on here.\nAnd my close colleague, close,\nclose colleague at Stanford,\nDr. David Spiegel, our\nAssociate Chair of Psychiatries,\nClinical Hypnotist.\nAmazing human being and\nscientist and clinician,\nhas really just embedded\nthis in my mind.\nThat the only way\nto deal with trauma\nis to get right up next to\nthat trauma to the point\nwhere some relief\nis experienced.\nThere is no other real way.\nAnd so, I really\nappreciate that you're\nsaying that the classic\npsychedelics may offer\nwith a very strong\nnudge, perhaps,\nthe opportunity to get into\nthe uncomfortable in a way\nthat MDMA or some non-classical\npsychedelics, perhaps, do not.\nWe were talking about time\nframes or duration of trips\nand these different\ncompounds and how they differ\nand how they're similar.\nI'd love for you to educate\nme on DMT and some of the work\nthat you're doing with DMT.\nMy understanding is that it's\na very brief trip minutes.\nPeople I know who\nhave done this.\nAgain, therapeutically,\nactually, I'll\njust point to one very\nexciting, I think,\ngroup and initiative which\nis the Veterans Solutions\nInitiative, which is a group--\nthis is carried out in\nMexico, but in conjunction\nwith laboratories at Stanford\nand elsewhere who are\nevaluating the neural changes.\nAnd this involves\nibogaine, which\nis iboga, which is a very\nlong duration psychedelic.\n22 hours or more, followed by I\nthink one or two doses of DMT.\nThis is for veterans to deal\nwith any number of issues.\nAppears to be working\nwith great success.\nAnd I've spoken\nto several people\nwho've gone through this.\nAnd the way that they described\nDMT, almost across the board,\nwas quote, here I'm just\npulling quotes, right?\nAnecdata.\nThe most profound experience\nof my entire life,\neven greater than the\nbirth of my children,\nquote, \"like being attached to\nthe shockwave of an atom bomb.\"\nQuote.\n\"There's no way I\nwould do another dose,\nbecause the first one\nwas so unbelievable.\"\nInteresting, by the way.\nI think most of\nus, including me,\nwould think, why wouldn't\nyou want to do it again then?\nBut this idea that that\nwas just beyond anything.\nSo these are\nsignificant-- excuse\nme these are significant\nstatements coming\nfrom individuals\nwho have existed\nat the extremes of human\nexperience to begin with.\nThese are so-called\ntier 1 operators\nwithin special operations\nwho exit and may or may not\nhave trauma.\nBut DMT sounds like a big deal.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Short\nduration, really big deal.\nWhat do we know\nabout its chemistry?\nWhat do we know about how\nit's impacting brain networks?\nAnd what in the\nworld is going on\nthat people are\ndescribing it as the ways\nI just mentioned\na few moments ago?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nIt's a rocket ship.\nIf the psilocybin is like a\nship leaving port, then yeah.\nThis is a rocket\nship into craziness.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIs it serotonin 2A?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It is.\nYeah.\nSo it is a classic psychedelic.\nIt's a direct agonist, a direct\nstimulator of the serotonin 2A\nreceptor.\nIt's an order of magnitude\nless potent than psilocybin.\nBut potency is a funny thing,\nbecause it's dose-dependent.\nSo that doesn't mean that\nthe experience with DMT\nis less than that of psilocybin.\nIt's just that you\ngive more of the drug.\nBut that's matched\nby it's stickiness\nfor the serotonin\n2A receptor, which\nis this kind of golden rule\nin psychedelic sciences\nthat it was discovered\nin the mid 1980s.\nThis tight relationship between\nthe affinity or the stickiness\nor the binding potential of a\npsychedelic for 2A receptor,\nin particular.\nSerotonin 2A and its potency.\nAnd the stickier the\ndrug, the more potent.\nSo LSD really sticky.\nVery, very potent.\nYou only need those\ntiny microgram doses.\nSo DMT, by its affinity,\nis a little less potent,\nbut by its effects when\nyou give a standard dose,\nit's just wild.\nAnd DMT, because there's another\ncompound called 5-methoxy DMT,\nwhich is a bit different\npharmacologically\nand subjectively, it's similar\nin terms of its kinetics.\nIt's another rocket ship.\nBoth compounds in the wild,\nso to speak, are smoked often.\nDMT and 5-MeO.\nPeople are vaping\nboth actually now.\nThere are vape pens that are\nbeing developed for people\nto administer this,\nbut more traditionally,\nit's been a smoking thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This is\nclinically not recreationally\nor both.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Both no.\nI mean, underground\npractitioners\nare using the vape pens.\nThey like them because\npeople titrate the dosage.\nThey get a feel for what it\nis to be going into this state\nso that they feel they\ncan let go and go into it.\nAnd actually, I think\nsome of the veterans work\nmight be giving 5-MeO\nafter the ibogaine.\nPhenomenologically, if there's\na difference between DMT\nand 5-MeO, people\nmight put it on 5-MeO\nbeing more of a reliable\nego dissolution experience.\nLess visual and more\nall round immersion\nin the greater whole\nloss of self-identity\nand just immersion\nin everything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nMaybe we could just talk about\nego dissolution for a second,\nbecause it's such a\nsticky, interesting idea.\nI can take a step back as a\nneuroscientist and say, OK.\nEgo dissolution.\nThis idea that-- from\na very early age,\nwe have a concept of self and\nthat I wake up every morning\nand I know I'm me and\nnot somebody else.\nAnd presumably, you do the same.\nAnd most people do the\nsame, I would hope.\nAnd that there are\nobjects in the world\nand people in the\nworld beyond us.\nBut every time I hear\nabout ego dissolution,\nit sounds like it's kind\nof a temporary elimination\nof the idea that\nthings start and stop\nbetween us and everything else.\nAlmost like in a kind\nof a-- here I'm not\ntrying to sound philosophical\nor metaphysical,\nbut there's the molecular\ncontinuity of life, right?\nWe're all just little bits--\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWhich is true.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--which is true, right?\nNot a functional way to\ngo through the day, right?\nBecause you want to\nmake a cup of coffee,\nyou don't really want\nto get lost in that\nif your goal is to\nmake a cup of coffee.\nBut what is the power\nof ego dissolution?\nIs it the idea that we belong,\nis it a sense of meaning?\nIs it the sense that we're\nnot as important as we think,\nwhich, of course, could be\na wonderfully useful way\nto go through life?\nTo think that we're not as--\nlike we are vitally important,\nbut we're not the only thing,\nright?\nBecause I do believe connection\nis vital as most people do.\nWhat is ego dissolution?\nAnd why would this serotonin\n2A activation cause that?\nThat's remarkable.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nGreat questions.\nI mean, what is it?\nYou alluded to it with\nthe start/stop, I think.\nBecause you could\ndefine it by boundaries.\nIn a sense what isn't\nme is as valid here\nas the a developing\nsense of what\nis me that a child\ndevelops at whatever age.\nAnd so a major characteristic\nof the ego dissolution\nexperience rather than just a\nnegative, a thing going away.\nMy sense of self going\naway is the positive.\nOh.\nNow, I feel interconnected\nwith other people and the world\nat large.\nAnd I realize that there is\nthat molecular continuity.\nAnd actually, that's\na ground truth.\nAnd oh, maybe the ego thing is\nsomewhat illusory or at least\na construction of my mind.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nindeed it is, right?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nWell, it is.\nYeah.\nI mean, there's no\ntranscendentalism about that.\nIt's just not like logic.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think we\nare about it a little bit\nlike family.\nI mean, we all know what\nimmediate family is, but it's\nlike--\nforgive me for\ninterrupting myself.\nI do it all the time, anyway.\nWhen I teach neuroanatomy,\nsome clever student\nalways figures out, OK.\nWell, that's connected to\nthat and that's connected.\nBut ultimately,\neverything in the brain\nis connected to everything else.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: There's\njust no way around that.\nThat's a true statement.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nso you really just\nhave to decide where you\ndraw the boundaries between--\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nWhere do you draw the line?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhere are the modules?\nWhat are the modules?\nYou could say, the brain is\njust one big macro module.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And then you\nalso want to include the body.\nAnd now fortunately,\npeople are starting\nto embrace this idea that\nit's not mind-body, it's both.\nBecause the nervous\nsystem extends through\nboth, of course.\nSo the same could\nbe said of family.\nWe're related, right?\nNot just by virtue of the\nfact that we're human beings.\nIf we did our\ngenealogical charts,\nwe would find a\nconvergence at some point.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And of course,\nthis becomes a bit of a game.\nBut then one realizes that\nwhere you draw the boundaries\nand if you draw them at\nbrother, sister, parents,\nbiological parents, et\ncetera, that's a game too.\nAnd so it is just a construct.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nI mean, it is a fun game.\nWhere do you draw the\nline and when to pass\nand when to collapse.\nIt's also a classic\nconsideration in science\nwhen to pass and when--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nlumper versus the splitter.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThere you go.\nIt's brilliant.\nYeah.\nBut you asked this\nquestion, like, well,\nwhy does psychedelics do it?\nAnd there, we think\npsychedelics do it,\nbecause the target\nreceptors, at least,\nclassic psychedelics do it.\nAnd that's important to stress.\nSo MDMA doesn't really\ndo it in the same way,\nmight soften the ego a bit.\nBut yeah.\nThat's debatable.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: My\nexperience with MDMA\nis that it's such a\nstrong empathogen.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And that it\ncan cause empathy for others.\nCertainly, you could\nimagine situations\nwhere one in MDMA\njourney and afterwards\nsays, oh, my oppressors are\nthe people that harmed me.\nAnd here I'm not referring\nto my experience.\nBut they did the best\nwith what they have.\nActually have empathy for them.\nForgiveness.\nBut also for oneself.\nThat there's an\nempathy for self,\nI know I said this earlier, that\nis very hard for most people\nto access.\nPerhaps, not the narcissists\nout there listening.\nThey'll be like, of\ncourse, empathy for self.\nBut everyone else, I think,\nall the other healthy people\nor the healthy people\nother than narcissists\nand not picking on narcissists.\nI have to imagine\nthey suffer too.\nIn fact, I think that's the\nroot of their narcissism.\nThat empathy for\nself is not something\nthat comes reflexively\nfor most people.\nAnd here I'm not talking about\nself love or self respect.\nBut this notion of being able\nto see the self as not just\ndeserving of love and\ncare but actually holding\nthat in place while\nin confrontation\nwith something challenging\nin a way that allows a more,\nnot less access to adaptive\nresponses to that challenge.\nI think that's the way\nI conceptualize it.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, drugs offer a great--\nthey offer great-- they\nare great scientific tools\nfor tackling this question.\nWhat is ego dissolution, and\nwhy do drugs modulate it?\nAnd what does that tell\nyou about the brain?\nBecause other drugs\nlike cocaine releasing\nmore of a different\nneurotransmitter,\ndopamine more than serotonin.\nThe opposite is\nthe case with MDMA.\nIs more of an ego\ninflator, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, absolutely.\nPeople will become\nhyper-linear, hyper-linked\nto their own desires and wishes,\nand future outcomes become\nan obsession.\nIt's the stuff of\nAmerican Psycho\nand the cliches and stereotypes\nof the '80s cocaine culture.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nWe did a study once\nactually looking\nat dose-dependent relationship\nwith ego inflation\non one axis and ego\ndissolution on the other\nand saw that it just massively\npassed or differentiated\nbetween cocaine\nand psychedelics.\nIt's quite a neat study.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo cocaine makes\npeople's egos super inflated?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd doesn't touch\ndissolution and the opposite\nis the case with psychedelics.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is\nthere any neuroimaging\nto explain how\ncocaine does that?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: That\nwould be a great study.\nYeah.\nGreat idea.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe should do that.\nI have a sabbatical coming up.\nI've got 12 months of\nsabbatical coming up.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nThat's--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm going\nto show up in your lab.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nThat's a really good one.\nIf it's all right to finish\nthe thread on why psychedelics\nand ego dissolution,\nwe do know some things\nor we have some hypotheses.\nAnd it's that the target\nreceptors, the serotonin 2A\nreceptors that classic\npsychedelics hit,\nare heavily expressed\nin what these days I\nlike to call recent brain.\nBecause evolutionarily,\nit's recent brain.\nIt's cortex that humans have\nmore than any other species.\nIf you look at a mapping of\ncortical expansion from say,\nmacaque or chimp to human,\nit's the very same map\nthat you'll find\nthe 2A receptors in.\nSo that's the target.\nAnd it's just easy to\nthink that-- oh, well, that\ncould be the egoic brain and the\nclassic psychedelics come in.\nThey scramble up the activity.\nThat's the entropic\nbrain action.\nAnd in terms of the\nstart/stop, the boundaries,\nthat entropic action\nspreads out the system.\nIt doesn't shut it off.\nIt spreads it out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Dissolution?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd you were talking about\nthe headspace as well.\nSo that fits.\nIf it's more capacious, it fits.\nThe big qualifier with\npsychedelic therapy\nthat people rightly bring\nup is it doesn't last.\nThat's the paradox of it.\nThe paradox of ego dissolution.\nSo the ego might go\naway during the trip,\nand you have these\nprofound insights\nabout the molecular continuity\nand how we're all one\nand interconnected.\nAnd then you come\ndown, and however\nlong later, the ego comes back,\nbut maybe with a vengeance.\nAnd sadly, things\ncan go awry when\npeople haven't done the work.\nPerhaps haven't\ndone the integration\nwork and maybe ego\ndefenses come back\nand it's not a pretty picture.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: How often\ndo you see that in the trials\nthat you do?\nWhat percentage of\npeople coming through\ndo you think end up\nwith worse than they\nwere before the trial?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's\nvery rare in the trials\nthat we've done.\nYeah.\nBut you see defenses come back.\nSo you do see people relapse.\nThat's more-- if\nyou're pushing out\nto like three months plus\nin something like treatment\nresistant depression,\nthat's more the rule\nthan the exception sadly.\nPeople relapse.\nIf their histories are\nhistories of chronic depression,\nthen while you might give\nthem a window of wellness,\nsadly, it doesn't last.\nThat's not to say that\nit doesn't ever last.\nIt does.\nAnd we have people who\nare in our first treatment\nresistant depression\ntrial who are\nwell to my knowledge\ntoday, back at work\ndoing fantastically well.\nBut sadly, the majority have\nrelapsed, to my knowledge.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And need to\ndo more psychedelic journeys.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, they\ncan't, because it's illegal.\nThat's been the really\ndifficult situation\nthat we've been up against.\nIs that we do a trial where\nall of a sudden this schedule 1\ndrug becomes a\nmedicine in the trial,\nor at least an\nexperimental medicine.\nWe give the treatment, it\nworks fantastically well,\ngives people a remission\nthat they've never really\nhad for however long,\nand then the trial ends\nand they're denied\nthat treatment.\nAnd worse still, if they\nwere to have that treatment,\nthey would be\ncommitting a crime.\nIt's a sick joke in a way.\nBut that's the situation\nthat we've been in.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthat's a perfect segue\nfor what I want to\ntalk about now, which\nis, what is the current\nstate of legality\nin terms of-- or the\nprogression towards legality.\nI'd also like to touch on\nthe role of, let's just say,\nincoming big pharma.\nThere are a lot of start\nup companies now trying\nto capitalize on\nthese discoveries\nthat you and others have made.\nThe landscape out there\nis very unclear to me.\nMaybe I'll just call out\nsome silos as I see them\nand maybe we can draw\nsome bridges between them,\nif they exist.\nAt the ground level,\nnot the grassroots,\nbut at the ground level,\nI look to laboratories\nlike yours, Matthew\nJohnson's, Roland Griffith's\nsome laboratories at Stanford.\nNolan Williams.\nLaboratories studying the\neffects of psychedelics\nin human beings, so\nnot animal models,\nin terms of their clinical\napplication for the treatment\nof depression, anorexia.\nI now know fibromyalgia, trauma.\nLet's lump MDMA\nin there as well,\nassuming that it all\nworks in equivalent way\nat the level of where the\nlegislature is taking things.\nOK.\nSo labs using government\nmoney, philanthropy, et cetera.\nThen there are the\ntherapists out there\nthat are accessing\nwhat we believe\nare clean sources of MDMA.\nPsilocybin, LSD to do this.\nThey are doing it illegally.\nThis is in the US or other\nWestern European countries,\nbecause, obviously, it's\ngoing to differ by country.\nWho are administering\nthese things\non the basis of what they're\nreading in these studies\nthat you all are publishing.\nBut also expanding on\nand experimenting hippie\nflips and combination drugs\nand ketamine and et cetera.\nBut let's leave ketamine out\nright now because it's legal.\nBut there's that.\nThen there's the--\nI don't want to say\nrecreational/open market,\nblack market.\nAnd here I want to\nraise a flag to the fact\nthat Dr. Peter Attia did\na terrific podcast on this\nrecently in his own\npodcast, The Drive.\nThe fact that fentanyl--\nlacing with fentanyl\nis now showing up in MDMA\nand psychedelics that\nare purchased on the street.\nSo serious caution\nto those getting it\nfrom uncertain sources.\nAnd then you've got pharma.\nAnd then as an umbrella\nfor all of this,\nyou've got the FDA and law\nenforcement agencies, which\ncurrently say, this\nstuff is illegal\nunless it's being used\nin a clinical trial.\nSelling it or possessing\nit can get you charged\nwith a crime ranging from--\nI don't want to say\nbecause I don't know.\nBut up to felonies.\nRight years in prison.\nSo can't take it\nthrough airports,\ndon't get caught with it,\ndon't buy it, don't sell it\nkind of thing.\nSo where are we going from\nthat picture of the silos?\nI know things are in\nclinical trials now.\nMost people, including\nmyself, are not\nfamiliar with how the different\nphases relate to the proximity\nto legality.\nCould you just give us the\nlandscape and touch on how long\nyou think it will\nbe before the people\nthat come through\nyour trials could then\ngo get a prescription\nfor psilocybin\nor potentially buy\nit without the risk\nfrom a reliable\nsource, one would hope,\nbut without the risk of\ngetting thrown in jail.\nI used to live in\nOakland, California.\nMy understanding-- and please\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, folks.\nDon't trust this information\nand get in trouble.\nMy understanding\nis that psilocybin\nis decriminalized in\nOakland, but that's\nnot the same as being legal.\nSo what is going on out there?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nWow.\nWell, so much.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI just asked 55 questions.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But feel free\nto answer just a subset of them\nif you like.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nWell, Oakland's a funny one.\nI live close to Oakland.\nThere are head shops\nin Oakland that\nmight be selling cannabis and\ncannabis-related paraphernalia\nthat are selling\nmushrooms as well.\nPsilocybin, mushrooms--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a fact.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: --openly.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a fact.\nI can verify that.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: OK.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nhaven't purchased them,\nbut I've gone in and checked\nit out, what's going on here.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nSo the police aren't\ngoing to prioritize\nthat activity, the purchasing\nof those mushrooms as a crime\nnow in Oakland because\nof the decriminalization.\nSo those head shops shouldn't\nstrictly be selling.\nWell, they shouldn't be selling.\nThey won't have a\nlicense to be selling.\nLicenses don't exist\nyet for that here.\nBut let's see whether\nthey get shut down.\nThey probably\nwill, I don't know.\nBut there's a church\nin Oakland sort of\nsay that they're selling and\nit's part of religious rights.\nThey're using that church\nmodel as a loophole, the way\nthat Native Americans\ncan use peyote\nand they have a more\ngenuine case, I think.\nBecause there is\na history there.\nBut they're trying to\nkind of piggyback on that.\nAnyway, that's close to\nwhere we are right now.\nBut federally, which is really\nthe major inflection point,\nis the FDA and the licensing\nof psychedelics as medicines\nto be legally prescribed across\nthe country, across the US\nand beyond, that is close\nbecause the key phase--\nso there are different\nphases of clinical trials,\nand the key one to know\nabout is phase III.\nPhase III trials are\nlicensing trials.\nIf they're successful,\nand typically you\nhave to do at least\ntwo successful ones,\nshow the results to\nthe regulators who\nare the FDA, the medicine\nregulators, and say,\nis this good enough now for\nyou to give me a license\nso that I can sell and provide\nthis medicine that we've\ndemonstrated is a medicine.\nSo that work has been\ndone with MDMA therapy\nfor post-traumatic\nstress disorder.\nMAPS have led that work and\ndone two phase III trials.\nI think they've already\npublicly announced\nthat the second\ntrial had results\nconsistent with the first.\nWe know the results\nof the first,\nbecause they're published and\nthey were remarkably good.\nSomething like 67%\nremission rates.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And long term.\nMy understanding is\nsome of those remission\nrates for trauma were years,\nwhich is different than what\nyou're describing\nfor psilocybin,\nwhere people might\nneed ongoing dosing.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nThat's true.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut of course, just\nfor trauma in those trials.\nMy understanding is those\nMDMA trials were not\nfocused on depression.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes.\nYes.\nFocused on the trauma.\nSo that's something,\nbecause that data\nis being filed now, to my\nknowledge, like as we speak.\nAnd they're anticipating\na decision maybe this year\nwith rollout happening\nas early as next year.\nI mean, that's\nbest case, I think.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask you\nwhen you, when you say rollout,\nand it's the appropriate\nterm for MDMA, because\nof so-called rolling.\nAbout 20% of my\naudience, maybe 50\nwill understand that not\nfunny joke that I made.\nWho's going to roll it out?\nWhere would one get the\nclean source of MDMA,\nmeaning not laced with fentanyl,\nnot laced with methamphetamine,\nnot undergone any\nchemical conversion\nto some other drug which can\nhappen with extended shelf\nlife, et cetera.\nAre people going to go to\ntheir psychiatrist to get MDMA?\nAnd who's going to\nbe providing it?\nIs it going to be\nsome big major pharma?\nThis seems like a\nserious set of issues.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm.\nIt is.\nAnd I don't have\nall the answers.\nI do know that MAPS would be\nproviding, because they've\ndone the work and they have\nset themselves up in a sense\nto potentially\nbecome the provider,\nwhether as a pharma company,\nwhich is the big question\nthey're wrestling\nwith at the moment.\nIt's very expensive to\nbecome a pharma company.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And yet\nthey probably deserve\nto make the choice,\nbecause they've\nput in so many years of hard\nwork when all of this stuff\nwas considered like\nraver culture party drug,\nthey were the ones that spotted\nthe therapeutic potential.\nI mean, we knew there was\ntherapeutic potential based\non work going back many\ndecades, but points to them,\nand I think in my opinion,\nthey should have the agency\nto make those decisions.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd it's such a remarkable\nthing that's been achieved.\nAnd I think they've done it\nall on philanthropic donations.\nI think so.\nYeah.\nSo there is this\nbig question mark.\nAnd the FDA are also\nasking questions about,\nto your question,\nwho can provide this,\nbecause in the phase III\nwork and up until this point,\nthere's been a MAPS training,\na MAPS therapist training.\nAnd you have to do this\nformal training in order\nto be a practitioner\nwithin the trials.\nBut now, there's a\nquestion from the FDA\nwhether that MAPS training\ncan be the training\nthat a clinician has to\nhave to now be a provider.\nAnd when I say rollout,\nit's like offering this\nas a service, essentially.\nAnd so where would the\nreferral come from?\nThat's a good question.\nThat I'm not 100% on the answer.\nWhether it would have to come\nfrom a psychiatrist or whether\nsomeone's--\nsort of general physician\ncould do that referral.\nBut they will be going\nto a provider who\nis licensed and certified and\nwill have done some training.\nAnd there will be\na consensus on what\nconstitutes good enough\ntraining to provide.\nThere will also be\nsome stipulations\non the basic underlying\nprofessionalism\nof the clinician who provides.\nSo I imagine, they'll have to\nbe a mental health professional.\nI don't think they would have to\nnecessarily be a psychiatrist,\nthey could be, I think,\na clinical psychologist.\nFor all the dosings, I\nthink without question,\nthere would have to be a\nphysician present or at least\nwithin ready access in\ncase of an emergency.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, especially,\nwith MDMA because of the\npropensity for cardiac issues.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because of\nthe amphetamine properties.\nAnd where is psilocybin in\nterms of the phase trials?\nIs it in phase II, phase III?\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nIt's in phase III.\nThere's psilocybin\ntherapy work being\ndone for treatment\nresistant depression\nby a company called Compass.\nThose trials which\nare always multi-site.\nSo there's always a bunch\nof teams or labs in a sense.\nGeographically spread\nout that are each\ncontributing to data that\nthen gets matched together\nand is then submitted as part\nof the phase III trial results.\nSo that's happening\nwith Compass right now.\nIt's psilocybin therapy for\ntreatment-resistant depression.\nThose trials have\njust started and I\nthink the earliest\nestimate that I\nheard in a journalistic\narticle was\nbecause I don't think\nCompass would say\nor they wouldn't say\npublicly something like 2026.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: '26.\nWow.\nSo MDMA is ahead of psilocybin.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Oh, yeah.\nYeah.\nIt's quite a few years ahead.\nAnd it's more of,\nnot a certainty\nbut it's very, very\nstrong position with MDMA.\nWhereas the work's\nonly just begun\nwith psilocybin in terms\nof the phase III trials.\nBut then you have\nthis other situation\nof however many psychedelic\nresearch centers\nthere are now across the globe,\nwe had the first one in London\nin 2019.\nThe first one in\n2019, it's 2023 now,\nand I don't know\nhow many there are.\nBut so much has happened in\nsuch a small space of time.\nYes.\nBut all these\ndifferent indications\nI've been able to tell\nyou about-- anorexia\nand fibromyalgia syndrome.\nTrying to do a trial\nwith a colleague of mine\nat UCSF in methamphetamine\nuse disorder.\nHe's got a trial going\non in Parkinson's disease\nand chronic lower back\npain and bipolar disorder.\nI mean, there's\nso much going on.\nOCD.\nAlmost the full gamut of\npsychiatric disorders.\nNot schizophrenia, to my\nknowledge, are being looked at.\nSo there's so much\ngroundswell of activity.\nAnd I think these small\ninvestigator-led studies,\ntypically, they're small\nbecause trials are expensive,\nare going to be reporting\npositive results.\nI know what we're seeing.\nAnd it will be four--\nlet's see now, at\nleast four trials all\nwith really positive results\nin very difficult-to-treat\ndisorders.\nAnd that's just us.\nAnd I know there's\nso much elsewhere.\nAddiction disorders as well.\nMike Johnson's work,\nobviously, Michael Bogenschutz.\nSo all this compelling\ngroundswell,\nit's really something.\nAnd yet the system\nto really make\na big breakthrough in terms of\nlicensing is, of course, slow.\nAnd that can frustrate people,\nbut it has to be done properly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nElse we revert back to\nwhat happened in the '70s\nwhere there was a lot of\ninterest in psychedelics.\nIt's interesting to me.\nThere was a close\njuxtaposition of meditation\nand behavioral approaches to\nself-directed state change\nand psychedelics.\nMeditation made it\nthrough the hatch.\nI mean, there were\nsome years where\nit was considered counterculture\nwoo magic carpet weirdo\nstuff by Western science.\nBut now, I mean, there are--\nprobably tens of\nthousands is not\nan overstatement of\nquality studies exploring\nhow meditation can provide\nadvantages for the mind\nand even for mental health.\nAnd psychedelics\nare now catching up,\nbut they used to\nbe close cousins\nin the cultural framework.\nBut the problem was,\nI think, psychedelics\nwere viewed as\nmaking people crazy.\nAnd university professors\nlost their jobs\nfor having discussions\nlike the one\nthat you and I are\nhaving right now.\nAnd some people went to\njail, but mostly people\neither left academic\ninstitutions\nor lost their jobs, whereas\nnow these are some of--\nthese studies of the\nsort that you are doing\nand that are taking place\nat Stanford and Hopkins and\nelsewhere are some of the\ngreatest magnetic pull\nfor philanthropy\nfor universities.\nDonors are very\ninterested in supporting\nthese sorts of studies, because\nthey and their family members\nand people they know suffer from\npsychiatric illness for which\nthe current big pharma\napproaches simply have not\nworked.\nSo it's interesting\nto me that what once\nwas seen as poison\nis now being viewed\nas a potential therapeutic.\nIt's not just\ninteresting, hopefully,\nit speaks to the evolution\nof the human species.\nPeople seem to be coming more\nopen-minded about becoming\nmore open-minded.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Right.\nYeah.\nThat's a good one.\nYeah.\nAnd yet-- yeah.\nThere's so much that's\nhappening so fast.\nAnd there are elements of--\nit's complexifying the space.\nThere is critique, there's\nbeen some bad practice\nin psychedelic therapy,\nboundary crossing issues\nthat have caused some scandals.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's too bad.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Isn't it?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWell, I think too the\ngene therapy, right?\nIt just takes one bad incident.\nGene therapy was on a fast\ntrack three decades ago\nand then sadly, a child died\nin a gene therapy trial.\nAnd it's like shut down\ngene therapy practically\nfor half a decade\nand then it slowly\nstarted ratcheting up again.\nGene therapy broadly\ndefined, and now we're\nin the age of potential\ndirected gene therapy using\nCRISPR and things\nof that sort, which\nmakes some people cringe and\nother people very excited.\nIf you have Huntington's\nin your family,\nCRISPR is like the most\nexciting technology ever,\nbecause you could potentially\neliminate it from your family\nline going forward, of course.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nSo I just really hope\nthat we can be balanced\nas this all plays out.\nBecause it could go similar\nway given the stigma, given\nthe history that people would be\nvery twitchy with some isolated\nincidents.\nAnd overgeneralize them,\nperhaps, in a sense,\nshining a light\non them, I think,\nis important that\nhas happened recently\nis important, because\nit really drills home\nhow important it is that\nthis work be done right\nand what the necessary\nsafeguards and standards should\nbe.\nYeah.\nAnd it won't be an\neasy road forwards.\nBut let's hope-- we've got\nto hope that it succeeds,\nbecause current\ntreatments-- people talk\nabout the mental health\ncrisis and to your point\nearlier about\nanorexia rates, it's\nnot always actually\nthe case when\nyou look at the epidemiology.\nWhen you look at\nthe data that you\nsee a big inflection\nin diagnoses or cases\nof psychiatric illness.\nI would say, it's more--\nthe treatments haven't moved.\nThey haven't really progressed.\nThey haven't got any better\nsince the 1950s more or less.\nAnd new drugs have\nbeen more of the same.\nSo there haven't been\nany paradigm shifts.\nAnd that's why I get\na little impassioned\nwhen I talk about psychedelic\ntherapy and that point\nthat this is\nsomething different.\nIt's not a drug every day.\nThat system, it's\nnot cutting it.\nDo we really want to\nkeep on with that system?\nSure.\nNot everyone will want to trip.\nAnd that will\nterrify some people\nso much that they'll\njust want to be\non their Lexapro or a\nnon-psychedelic, psychedelic,\nor whatever.\nAnd of course, it should be\nallowed to have those options.\nOf course.\nAnd the more\noptions, the better.\nBut I think there is great\nvalue in really understanding\nwhat psychedelic therapy is.\nAnd I think when\nyou do, you realize\nthat it is a major paradigm\nchallenge on many levels.\nAnd the fact that it's\ndifferent might be its greatest\nappeal at the moment, I think.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I am certainly\ngrateful for your passion for\nthe potential for psychedelics\nto be added to the array\nof potential treatments.\nAnd I really also appreciate\nhow much you put it in there\nalongside the other treatments.\nMaybe even in combination\nwith other treatments\nas opposed to saying,\nthis is the thing that's\ngoing to cure everything.\nAnd yet the passion\nthat you have\nfor this potential paradigm\nshift, the one that really\nappears to be happening at\nthe level of clinical data now\nis so important.\nSo I want to extend\na voice of gratitude\nfor that and for the\nwork that you're doing.\nI mean, I've been\noutside of this field,\nbut as a neuroscientist, I've\nbeen paying careful attention\nto it really for the last\nfive, seven years or so.\nAnd it's abundantly\nclear that it\nis a small group of individuals\nwho are really thinking\nin terms of how the\nsystem works now\nand what needs to be\ndone in order to change\nthe system for the\nbetter like yourself\nthat are really the driving\nforce behind this new movement\nor paradigm shift.\nThat without question,\nis going to lead\nto improvements in mental health\nand physical health outcomes.\nSo I just want to say\nthank you for that.\nAlso thank you so much for\njoining us today to share\nthis immense knowledge set about\nthe history of psychedelics.\nWhat they are, what they aren't.\nTheir clinical applications\nas seen in your laboratory\nand other laboratories.\nI'm sure people\nalready notice this,\nbut you're incredibly generous\nin terms of attribution\nand also in your\ncaution about explaining\nhow some of the\nresults in particular,\non anorexia, fibromyalgia, are\nperhaps preliminary but very\nexciting.\nThey're not published\nyet, anyway.\nWe wouldn't call\nthem preliminary.\nAnd also for touching\non mechanism.\nThat is not just about people\nfeel better, but pointed\nto some potential\nunderlying mechanisms\nin terms of connectivity\nchanges and on and on.\nSo thank you so much\nfor your time today.\nThank you for the work\nthat you're doing.\nAnd thank you for the work\nthat is sure to continue.\nWe will provide links to\nstudies in your laboratory,\nlinks to your laboratory\nso people can learn more\nand support in the ways that\nthey deem appropriate for them.\nBut just thank you,\nthank you, thank you.\nSuch important work\nyou're doing, Robin.\nROBIN CARHART-HARRIS:\nThank you, Andrew.\nIt's been a pleasure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for joining me today\nfor my
