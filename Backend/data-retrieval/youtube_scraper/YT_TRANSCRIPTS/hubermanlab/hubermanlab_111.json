    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the\nHuberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science and science\n-based tools for everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are discussing hair.\nHair is a topic that occupies\nthe minds of many people.\nThere are people that are losing their\nhair and want to halt or\nreverse that loss of hair.\nToday, we will talk about all the ways\nthat science has taught us we can\nslow or even reverse hair loss.\nI confess that researching today's topic\nwas a particular joy for me not because\nI'm obsessed with hair,\nmine or the hair of others,\nbut because hair turns out to be\nfascinating from the perspective\nof cellular biology and stem cells,\nwhich is a topic that I've long been\ninterested in and that for much\nof my career I focused on in\nthe context of development.\nWhen your brain and your nervous system\ndevelop, it develops from a small batch\nof cells  that turns\ninto many trillions of cells.\nIt does that by cell replication,\nsomething that we call the cell cycle.\nWe'll talk a little bit about\nthis and so-called mitosis today.\nI promise not to get into too much detail.\nBut what makes hair so very interesting\nfrom a biological standpoint is that every\nhair, every single individual strand\nof hair has its own little stem cell\nniche, meaning its own little pocket down\nthere in the follicle in which specific\nstem cells give rise to those hairs\nfor different durations of time,\ndepending on the hair,\nwhere it is on your body, et cetera.\nFor instance, the hairs on your head will\nundergo ongoing growth\nfor 4-6 or even 8 years.\nWere you to not cut your hair,\nit would continue to grow.\nOne single hair would continue to grow.\nI guess we could say all the hairs will\ncontinue to grow for up to 8 years.\nThat is very different from, for instance,\nyour eyebrows, which have a much  shorter\nperiod of hair growth lasting\non the order of months.\nThat's why you don't see people with\neyebrows that extend down to their waist.\nBut you can see people with hair on their\nhead that extends down to their\nwaist if they don't cut it.\nNow, that discrepancy illustrates for us\njust how incredible hair follicles\nand the stem cells that reside within\nhairs are and their enormous potential\nto give rise to these things that we call\nhairs, which are simply proteins\nof varying length.\nToday, we are going to address what\ndetermines the length of a hair or rather\nwhat determines how long a hair continues\nto grow before it ceases growing\nand eventually falls out.\nWe're going to talk about what regulates\nthose stem cells,\nwhat allows them to continue to produce\nhair or cease producing hair.\nAs we do that,\nyou will learn all the biology in clear,\nsimple terms,\nregardless of your background,\nthat will really set the stage\nfor understanding what we'll also talk\nabout, which is how to slow hair loss or\nhalt hair loss entirely  or\neven reverse hair loss.\nWe will talk about hormone -related\nhair loss in both men and women.\nWe will talk about some of the mechanical\nand stress -related\ninfluences on hair loss.\nWe will talk about the chemical\nand mechanical approaches to halting\nand reversing hair loss,\neverything from minoxidil to\ndutasteride to ketoconazole\nto microneedling to thyroid,\nestrogen, IGF-1 pathways.\nAgain, all made very clear regardless\nof whether or not you have\na background in biology or not.\nI will also dispel some of the common\nmyths about balding and hair replacement.\nIf you've heard, for instance,\nthat you inherit your patterns of balding\nfrom your mother's father,\nthat is not true.\nAlthough it is true that you do inherit\ncertain genes that influence whether or\nnot you have a predisposition to balding\nin particular parts of your head,\nand believe it or not,\neven in particular parts of your body.\nBut it is not the case that you can simply\nfind a photo of your mother's father, say,\nage 50, or age 60 or 75,\nand determine whether or not you'll have\nthe exact same pattern of hair loss.\nThat's a myth that I'd like\nto dispel right here and now.\nI will dispel some of the other myths\nabout hair loss, hair replacement,\nand hair regrowth as well.\nBefore we begin, I'd like  to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however,\npart of my desire and effort to bring zero\ncost to consumer information about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nI've talked many times before on this\npodcast about the fact that sleep  is\nthe foundation of mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nHelix understands that everybody's\nsleep needs are slightly different.\nIf you go to their website,\nyou can take a brief quiz,\nand that quiz will ask you questions such\nas, do you sleep on your back,\nyour side, or your stomach?\nMaybe you don't know which is fine.\nYou can simply answer, I don't know.\nOr do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night?\nHelix takes those answers and then matches\nyou to a mattress that's\nideal for your sleep needs.\nFor me, it matched me\nto the dusk, D-U-S-K mattress.\nI've been sleeping on a dusk mattress\nfor over 2 years now, and my sleep has\nbeen better than it ever was previously.\nIf you're interested in upgrading your\nmattress, go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their brief  2-minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you\nto a customized mattress for you.\nYou'll also get up to $350 off any\nmattress order and two free pillows.\nThey have a 10-year warranty , and you get\nto try out their mattress\nfor 100 nights risk-free.\nThey'll even pick it up for you\nif you don't love the mattress.\nBut I think you will.\nI certainly love mine.\nAgain, if you're interested,\ngo to helixsleep.com /huberman for up\nto $350 off and two free pillows.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by HVMN ketone-IQ.\nKetone-IQ is a ketone supplement\nthat increases blood ketones.\nI want to be very clear that I, like most\npeople have heard of the ketogenic diet,\nbut I, like most people,\ndo not follow a ketogenic diet.\nThat is, I'm not in ketosis.\nHowever, most people don't realize\nthat you can still benefit from increasing\nyour blood ketones, which is what\nHVMN ketone-IQ does.\nI take Ketone-IQ prior to doing\nreally focused cognitive work,\nso I take it once in the afternoon,\nany time I'm going  to prepare\nfor a podcast, or do a podcast,\nor if I'm going to do some research, or\nfocus on a grant, anything that requires\na high level of cognitive demand.\nThat's because ketones are the brain's\npreferred use of fuel, even if you're\nnot following  a ketogenic diet.\nI sometimes also use Ketone-IQ prior\nto workouts, either resistance training\nworkouts or endurance\nworkouts such as running.\nAgain, that's because Ketone-IQ\nby raising blood ketones\nis really a brain fuel.\nIf you're interested in trying  Ketone-IQ,\ngo to

sunglasses\nthat were designed with the biology\nof the visual system in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working\non the biology of the visual system,\nand I can tell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with an enormous  number\nof challenges for you to be able\nto see clearly throughout the day.\nFor instance, when you go  from a shady\narea to a well-lit area,\nyour brain and eyes have to make a bunch\nof different adjustments that eyeglasses\nof the conventional type\ndon't always compensate for.\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses compensate\nfor those sorts of changes and all\nthe sorts of changes that your visual\nsystem has to contend with, so you\nalways see things with crystal clarity.\nThe company was founded by two all-America\nswimmers from Stanford, and initially,\ntheir eyeglasses and sunglasses were\ndesigned for sports performance.\nIndeed, all of their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses can be used\nwhile running, while cycling.\nThey won't slip off your\nface if you get sweaty.\nThey're extremely lightweight.\nBut they also have an enormous number\nof varieties of eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are designed to be\nworn at work or to dinner.\nThey have the classic performance\neyeglasses where makes you look\nlike a cyborg, if you like those.\nThey also have more conventional esthetics\nthat you'd be comfortable\nwearing  pretty much anywhere.\nIf you'd like to

checkout.\nOkay, let's talk about hair.\nIn researching this episode by talking\nto experts in the biology of hair,\nand the stem cells that exist in all of us\nthat give rise to our hair growth,\nand the pigmentation in our hair,\nand in talking to experts who understand\nhow to halt and even reverse hair loss,\nthat there is a tremendously\ninteresting biology surrounding hair.\nBut there's also an incredible\npsychology around hair.\nIn fact, most people who experience even\nmarginal hair loss undergo\npretty severe anxiety.\nNow, I confess this is not\nsomething I can relate to.\nI am losing my hair in certain places.\nI'm 47 years old.\nI've got a couple of patches up front\nwhere there's very minimal hair.\nI think that, as we'll later learn in this\nepisode, reflects a higher density of DHT,\ndihydrotestosterone, receptors\nat that particular location  as\nopposed to elsewhere in my scalp.\nBut keeping my hair is not something\nthat I've fretted about much of my life.\nYet as I was researching this episode,\nI remembered an anecdote from my childhood\nwhere my father told me,\nand I think it was because I was stressing\nabout something,\nI was trying to get to sleep, and he said,\n\"Don't stress . Calm\ndown.\" And here's why.\nIf you stress too much,\nit can actually make your hair fall out.\nIn fact, I have a cousin who lay down one\nnight stressed,\nand woke up the next morning , and\nall of his hair was on his pillow.\nI'll never forget that story.\nI think he was trying\nto get me to stress less.\nI don't know if that story\nmade me stress less or not.\nBut in any event, I don't\nknow that that story is true.\nI'm not going to challenge\nthe authenticity of that story.\nI didn't have a chance to reach out\nto my father and ask him to verify or not.\nBut as we will soon learn,\nit is true that our psychological\nwell-being can impact both the coloration\n,, or lack thereof and the\ngrowth rates of our hair.\nThat's a real thing.\nThe reverse is also true,\nwhich is that as hair starts to thin, or\nfall out, or change color,\nmany people expect intense\nanxiety or even depression.\nThis was not something\nI was really aware of.\nPerhaps that's just because I've always\nkept my hair pretty short anyway.\nI always assumed that if my hair started\nto really fall out,\nI would just shaved my head.\nBut that's me, and that's\nnot most people out there.\nI think most people would\nloathe to lose their hair.\nIn fact, given the enormous number,\nprobably up in the high billions\nof dollars and euros and other currency,\nof course, that people invest in trying\nto halt or reverse their hair loss,\nit's clear that hair is\nvery important to people.\nWhat we know is that by age 50,\napproximately 50% of all men and women\nwill have experienced significant enough\nhair loss that they start to notice it.\nAnd a large percentage,\nup to 85% of those people will experience\nsome anxiety  that leads them to go out\nand try and either halt or\nreverse that hair loss.\nNow, why at age 50?\nWell, an important point arises from that,\nwhich is that the hair loss is not\noccurring between the 49th\nand 50th birthday.\nHair loss is ongoing\nfrom about age 30 to age 50.\nIt's only by age 50, however,\nthat about 50% of people out there\nstart to notice that hair loss.\nThis is typically because\nthey'll be in a bathroom or looking\nin a mirror and the lighting will be\nbright enough that it permeates\nthe outer boundary of their hair.\nThey'll notice that their hair is\nthinning in a particular location.\nThat's usually how this thing happens.\nAgain, our psychological states can impact\nour patterns of hair growth or loss\nand of course, patterns of hair growth,\nbut more typically,\nhair loss and hair graying can\nreally impact psychological states.\nThis is a subject that people\ntake intense interest in.\nToday, we're going to talk about how hair\nnormally grows, why it grows at the rate\n, and for the duration that it happens to.\nThen as we talk about ways to intervene\nwith that hair loss,\nthose biological mechanisms will come up\nbecause they really provide a nice\nframework for explaining why certain\ntreatments  work more or less well or why\ncertain treatments might have certain side\neffects or total lack of side effects.\nIt will also highlight a really key theme\nthat will come up several times in today's\npodcast, which is that there are both\nmechanical and chemical approaches\nto slowing and reversing hair loss.\nMechanical approaches would be things  as\nsimple as massaging the scalp,\nbut mechanical changes to the scalp  can\ncause either hair loss or\nfacilitate hair growth.\nThis is why things like microneedling  are\nso prominent in the context\nof trying to reverse hair loss.\nBut again, there are also chemical\napproaches to trying to halt\nor reverse hair loss.\nThis relates to the fact that the hair\ngrowth itself is strongly regulated\nby hormones such as estrogen,\nthyroid hormone,\ninsulin-like growth factor,\nand that other hormones, in particular\nthe androgens,\nso things like testosterone,\nbut mainly it's derivatives like\ndihydrotestosterone are very much involved\nin setting the stage for hair growth\nby controlling how big or small that pool\nof stem cells that gives rise\nto hair growth is.\nIf any of the terms I just use are\nconfusing to you, don't worry, I will\nmake all of those very clear in a moment.\nIt's actually all pretty\nstraightforward and simple.\nI'd like to just start by talking about\nwhat hair is, how it grows, why it stops\ngrowing, and why hair normally falls out.\nLet's talk about the biology of hair.\nIn doing so, I also want\nto talk about stem cells.\nNow, keep in mind that when you hear\nthe word stem cells, you probably,\nlike most people, think about the sorts\nof cells that people are getting injected\ninto their face to get rid of wrinkles,\nor give them new skin,\nor to give them more hair  if it's\ninjected in the scalp, or into a joint\nto repair a joint or a muscle.\nThose stem cells are what we\ncall exogenous stem cells.\nExogenous, meaning from outside the body.\nThe stem cells that we're going to talk\nabout today are so-called endogenous stem\ncell, cells that we all make\nthat can give rise to other cells.\nThat's really the definition\nof a stem cell.\nStem cells are present in all of us\nfrom the very beginning of life.\nWhen sperm meets egg, that cell,\nwhich we think of as the egg,\nstarts to duplicate,\nit incorporates the DNA from the sperm\nand the egg, of course,\nstarts to duplicate,\nand then those cells give rise to more\ncells and more cells and the ability\nof all those cells to replicate and create\nmore cells are because those\ncells  really are stem cells.\nNow, at some point we are a completed\nbody plan, as the biologists say.\nWe end up with a brain, and a spinal cord,\nand limbs, and fingers, and livers,\nand guts, and all the things that we need\nin order to be a functioning human being.\nEven though we're a baby at that time,\nwe haven't grown up,\nwe have all the bits that we're\ngoing to have for our entire life.\nAt that point, many of the stem\ncell populations disappear.\nFor instance, past puberty,\nand probably earlier, you don't\nget many more new brain cells.\nYou get a few, but you don't get many more\nnew brain cells because the brain doesn't\nhave many stem cell populations,\nwhereas other organs in your body maintain\nlittle pockets of stem cells,\nor in some cases, many stem cells that can\ngive rise to more and more\nof that tissue across the lifespan.\nHair is one such tissue.\nIf we take a look at hair,\nwhat we find is that, indeed,\nthere are these things that we call hairs,\nbut there are also stem cells,\nand those stem cells are actually what\ngive rise to the hairs that we see\non the head of our scalp or that we\nsee on the surface of our body.\nRight off the bat,\nyou should know  that every single hair\nthat you have is there because you have\na stem cell population that is giving\nrise  to that particular hair.\nLet's take a step back, or rather,\nI should say, let's zoom in on one hair\nand the stem cell population that gives\nrise to that hair, because in doing so,\nyou're going to learn  all the different\ncomponents that you can tap into if your\ngoal is to halt the loss of hairs or\nto replace hairs  that have\nalready been lost.\nIf we were to just zoom in at the level\nof one hair, what you would find is\nthat that hair has what typically is\ncalled a hair root, so that's\nthe portion below the skin.\nWhen we say below the skin,\nit means that it dives down into a narrow\ntrench, which is in the so-called\nepidermis, which is this\nouter layer of skin.\nIt also has a shaft.\nThe shaft is the part\nthat grows out above the skin.\nWhat you see on somebody's head\nor you see on their arm,\nor when you see an eyebrow,\nyou're seeing the shaft of the hair.\nThe root, of course, goes below the skin.\nWhat most people don't realize, however,\nis that down at the base of the root,\nthere's actually a little\ncave, a little pocket.\nIf you were to look at this,\nit would look like a little bulb,\na little round area with a bunch\nof stuff in it right below the root.\nWithin that little cave,\nthere are stem cells.\nThere are populations of cells\nthat have the ability to divide.\nWe call this mitosis.\nIt's a process by which cells can actually\ndivide, and take DNA with them,\nand then give rise to other cells.\nWe call those cells that divide and move\nout, we call those daughter cells.\nWe call the cells that give rise to them\nprogenitor cells, but they are effectively\nstem cells  that give rise to these\nwhat we call daughter cells.\nThose daughter cells then become\nthe various types of cells\nthat make up the hair.\nWhen you see a hair,\nyou're not seeing something\nthat grows throughout the lifespan.\nYou're seeing something that's going to be\nborn down there in that little cave,\nthen is going to grow.\nIt's actually going to stack\nup on top of itself.\nThat's because hairs are made\nup of a protein called keratin.\nThere are a bunch of different kinds\nof keratin depending on what\nkind of hair you're looking at.\nBut these are little proteins that stack\nup on top of one another,\nand they're structured in a way\nthat makes them pretty darn durable.\nI mean, it's possible, of course,\nto pull a hair out.\nBut if you've ever tried to tear a hair,\nin particular,\nthick hair like one from the face or even\none off the top of your head,\nit's actually a pretty\ntensile strong little thing.\nThat's because keratins  stack up on top\nof one another and bind to one\nanother with a really strong bond.\nWhat you end up with is a bunch\nof proteins stacked up on top of one\nanother, and that's the actual hair.\nWe've got the hair shaft, the hair root,\nand then we've got the stem cells down\nthere in that pocket  that give rise\nto the various cells\nthat make up the actual hair.\nWe also have down there  in that little\ncave, which, by the way,\nis actually called the hair bulb,\nif you really want to know the technical\nname because it's shaped like a bulb.\nWe have not just stem cells,\nbut we have cells that give rise\nto the pigment of the hair\nthat create what's called melanin.\nNow, some people have very blond hair,\nvery light hair,\nsome people have darker hair.\nBut everybody, unless they have what's\ncalled the albino mutation,\nwhere the hairs are truly white,\nthey lack all melanin,\nand it's a pretty rare condition,\nalthough it does happen,\nmost people have some degree of melanin\nin their hairs because there are little\npockets of melanin-producing cells.\nMelanin is just a protein that essentially\ngets injected  into the keratin, into\nthe hair, and gives it its darker color.\nNow, there are a couple  other components\nabout the hair that you need to know\nabout, especially if you're interested\nin reversing hair loss or\nreversing graying of hair.\nOne of those components is a little gland.\nNext to every hair root\nwithin the dermal layer of the skin,\nso this is below the epidermis,\nthere is a gland called the sebaceous\ngland, and the sebaceous gland makes oily\nstuff, and the oily stuff is called sebum.\nI know the name evokes something gross,\nbut sebum is actually really\ncool and really important.\nThe sebum gets injected, or seeps rather,\ninto the area right around the hair\nas the hair starts to approach the surface\nwhere it goes from essentially\nroot to shaft.\nThe sebum does two things.\nFirst of all, it forms a little bit\nof a seal right at the place\nwhere the hair exits the skin.\nAnd that seal is very important,\nactually, for waterproofing of your skin.\nSo we don't often think of ourselves as\nwaterproof because we are so accustomed\nto water just landing on our\nskin and and rolling off.\nBut that's because of some\nof the oily properties of our skin.\nNow, it's also true that our skin is\npretty densely packed with cells.\nBut in the absence of sebum,\nwe would not be as waterproof as we are.\nNow as I mentioned, sebum has\ntwo important properties.\nThe other important property of sebum is\nthat it actually is a strong\nantibacterial and antimicrobial.\nMost people don't realize this,\nthe oils of your skin provide a lot\nof immune boundary,\nso that things don't get  into the hair\nroot or the region around\nit and infect our skin.\nSo sebum, while the name is sort\nof unattractive, to be honest,\nis actually performing some essential\nroles both for waterproofing and for our\nimmune system function,  protecting\nus from various kinds of infection.\nWe're going to return to sebum later.\nAs it turns out,\nsebum is also very important as it relates\nto psoriasis and as it relates to some\nof the fungal components\nthat can cause hair loss.\nSo I'm just going to file that away.\nThere's another important component\nof the region around hairs,\nwhich is the  arrector pili muscle.\nThe arrector pili muscle is a muscle\nthat lies diagonally between that bulb\nportion of the hair or a little bit above\nit, and goes up to the\nsurface of the skin.\nThe arrector pili muscle\nis a muscle that contracts when we\nget cold or when we get scared.\nSo if you've ever had goosebumps,\nthat's because the  arrector pili muscle\ncontracts pulling the skin at the surface\ndown around the little hair follicles,\nor at least where the hairs\nmeet the surface of the skin.\nAnd so those little bumps are actually\nwhere little micro hairs reside.\nAnd the dimples between them are\nthe dimples that occur when this\narrector pili muscle pulls down.\nNow, why would this muscle exist?\nIt has a couple of important functions.\nOne of the functions is that when it\npulls down, it causes, as the name\nsuggests, the hairs to stand up.\nMaybe not perfectly vertical,\nbut when you hear, oh, I was so\nfrightened, my hair stood up on end.\nAnd that's because\nthe hair has become erect.\nThey stand up.\nNow, why would this\nhappen when we get cold?\nIt happens because when the hairs stand\nup, air can be trapped between those\nhairs and can actually warm our body.\nThis is not so much the case if you\nhave very light hair on your skin.\nIf you're a very hairy person,\nthis is going to be a more robust\naspect of your physiology.\nAnd yes, this is why dogs like Huskies can\ngo out in the snow and still remain warm.\nWhen they get cold,\ntheir hairs actually stand up a bit on end\nbecause of the contraction of these\narrector pili muscle\ntrapping air in there.\nAnd then their body warms the hair\ntrapped beneath the hair.\nAnd it's like they've got  a blanket\non made by the interface between the hair,\nthe air, and their skin.\nSo just to recap all the components\nof hair and the different things around it\nthat are going to be relevant\nfor understanding how\nto replace hair that's lost.\nWe have the hair itself,\nwhich has the shaft that sticks out over\nthe skin, goes a little bit into the skin,\nbut basically sticks out over the skin.\nWe have the root portion\nwhich goes down into the skin.\nIt goes through the epidermis\nand into the dermis.\nThen we have this bulb like\nregion down at the bottom.\nDown at the bottom of that bulb,\nwe have stem cells that actually give rise\nto the actual hair, and we have\npigmented cells that pigment that hair.\nIn addition, and this is very important,\nthere are capillaries that go\ninto that bulb region down at the bottom\nof the hair and that can serve and support\nthe stem cells, the melanin producing\ncells, which are called melanocytes.\nSo the melanin producing cells in the stem\ncells get a lot of blood flow that allows\nthem to keep providing new hair or\nthe proteins that make up hair\nand the pigment that goes into those hairs\nand those little capillaries deliver not\njust nutrients and things of that sort,\nbut they also deliver oxygen because it\nturns out that the whole process\nof growing more hair is\na very active process.\nNow, as soon as you hear oxygen and you\nhear that the growth is an active process,\nthat should cue you to why so many\nof the stories around how to keep your\nhair and regrow hair involve statements\nlike don't wear a hat,\nit'll make your hair fall out.\nOr if you want your hair to grow back,\ndon't wear hats or massage your\nscalp or increase blood flow.\nOr why some people will suggest\nthat people take peppermint oil,\nfor instance,\nor menthol type oils of different\nkinds and massage them into the scalp.\nThings that make the scalp tingle.\nOr there will be light\ntherapies designed to what?\nTo increase blood flow to the scalp.\nThe whole rationale there is that you're\ntrying to increase blood flow to the stem\ncell and the melanocytes populations\nthat support the hairs\nand that actually create the hairs.\nNow, whether or not those are  approaches\nwork we'll touch  on a little bit later.\nI'll just give you a little bit of a hint\nright now, which is that while no single\none of those approaches that I described\nis known to regrow hair in a very robust\nway because of the requirement for oxygen\nand nutrients and because it's such\nan active process for the stem cells\nand melanocytes to grow and darken\nthe hairs that grow out of your skin.\nIt is true that manipulations or\ntreatments that increase blood flow\nto those regions can at least slow\nthe loss of hair or can even extend\nthe duration over which\nhairs continue to grow.\nSo if you've heard things like don't wear\na hat, if you want to maintain your hair.\nOr massage your scalp,\nif you want your hair to grow faster.\nIn some sense that's true,\nbut none of those manipulations on their\nown is going to robustly enhance\nthe rate of of your hair growth.\nThose things are designed to be done\nin conjunction with some other treatments\nthat have been shown in many,\nmany clinical studies to increase\nthe rate and duration of hair growth.\nSo now you have in mind a picture\nof what's happening at the level\nof individual hairs.\nAnd if you're anything like me,\nyou're probably thinking, Wow,\nthere's a lot going on down there\njust below the surface of the skin.\nAnd indeed there is.\nBut really the things to think about are\nthat stem cell population that actually\ngive rise to the hair proteins so\nthat actually create the hair.\nThe melanocytes that darken that hair,\nthat give it pigment.\nThat sebaceous gland and the oil sebum\nthat provides some important antimicrobial\nand other properties\nto that general region.\nAnd that arrector pili muscle,\nthat arrector pili muscle,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nis important for creating goosebumps\nand it's important for keeping\nHuskies warm in cold environments.\nBut it's doing some other really important\nthings as well, and we'll talk about\nthose as time goes on in this episode.\nRight now, what I want to do is just talk\nfor a moment about how hairs actually\ngrow and why they grow the way they do.\nThis is extremely important toward\nunderstanding hair replacement\nand slowing hair loss.\nThere are three basic\nphases of growth of a hair.\nThe first phase is the phase\nin which the stem cells down in that bulb\ngive rise to the cells that make up\nthe proteins of the hair,\nso the actual growth of the hair.\nAnd keep in mind that the hair is\nactually growing from the bottom up.\nNow, you might think, of course,\nit's growing from the bottom.\nEveryone knows that.\nBut a lot of people think that the hair\nstarts growing right\nat the surface of the skin.\nThat's not the way it works.\nThe hair is actually growing from deep\nwithin the root and stacking up and then\neventually extends out\nacross the top of the skin.\nThat growth phase is\ncalled the anagen phase.\nA-N-A-G-E-N.\nAnd this for some people will  ring a bell\nbecause if you've ever been interested\nin weightlifting or even if you're\nan endurance runner,\nyou'll hear about things that are anabolic\nthat promote growth, so Anna of Growth.\nOr catabolic  that promote breakdown.\nSo the first phase of hair growth is\ncalled the anagen phase,\nand it's a period of varying duration\ndepending on which hair\nin the body we're talking about.\nSo the anagen or the growth phase\nfor hairs on the head, as I mentioned\nearlier, is anywhere from 2 to 8 years.\nFor most people, it's going\nto be about six years.\nWhat this means is that if we were to just\nnot cut our hair, just let our hair grow\nfor 2 to 8 years,\nthat hair would eventually grow\nto a length that it was at its\nmaximum and then would stop growing.\nSo we can say that the anagen phase\nof hairs on the scalp is 2 to 8 years.\nThe the duration of the growth phase.\nContrast that, for instance,\nwith the duration of the anagen\nphase for hairs of the eyebrows.\nThe hairs of the eyebrows grow\nabout 4.2mm per month.\nBelieve it or not, people\nhave measured this thing.\nNow that's an average.\nSo some people are going to have eyebrows\nthat grow much longer per month.\nI'm somebody who, for instance,\nhas mostly the same length eyebrow hairs,\nbut every once in a while I get one\nof those eyebrow hairs that really seems\nto be heading off my head,\nlike really wants out of there.\nAnd so it's much longer than the rest.\nWhat does that mean?\nDoes it mean that it grew faster?\nMaybe.\nBut chances are the stem cell population\nin that particular eyebrow follicle\nfor that one eyebrow hair\nis longer than it is for the others.\nThis is really important.\nI'm trying to illustrate two\nprinciples at once here.\nThe first principle is that different\nhairs on your body,\nincluding the hairs on your scalp, have\na growth phase of different duration.\nThis is why the hairs on your head can\ngrow very, very long because they have\na very long anagen or growth phase,\nand the hairs on your eyebrows will only\ngrow for a few months  before they\nactually fall out and then have\nto undergo replication  of the stem cells\nto give you new eyebrow hair to then grow.\nWhat's important here is not just\nthat there are differences in the duration\nof the growth phase,\nbut rather that the rate of hair growth\nis not something that tends to differ\nwithin a given body region.\nYou'll hear people say, \"Oh,\nmy hair grows really,\nreally fast.\" Other people will say, \"Oh,\nmy hair grows really, really slowly.'\nThat is probably not the case.\nWell, there could be slight\ndifferences in the rate of growth.\nThat is the addition of more  keratin\nto the actual hairs,\nso creation of more hair more quickly.\nAlmost certainly what's happening is\nthat the duration of the anagen phase\nin some people is just much longer\nthan it is in other people.\nWe don't realize this,\nand we tend to think more  in terms of how\nfast hair  grows,\nbecause if you were to just look\nat somebody's hair, you'd say, \"Oh,\nthey're all more or less the same length.\"\nI mean, some people's bangs are shorter\nthan the back because they cut them.\nBut if they were to just grow their hair,\nyou'd say, \"Oh, it's all more or less\nthe same length.\" But if we were to zoom\nin with a microscope,\nwe would see that there are a lot\nof hairs down there in between the other\nhairs that are very,\nvery short or even tiny, tiny, tiny.\nThose are coming in as the other ones\nare finishing their anagen phase.\nThat's the anagen or growth phase.\nAfter the anagen phase\ncomes the catagen phase.\nAgain, this resembles the word\ncatabolic or the breakdown phase.\nDuring the catagen phase,\nthe hair is actually receding not\nfrom the top down to the skin surface and\nthen into the root,  but the other way.\nIt's actually receding   from that bulb\nregion up toward the surface.\nThat catagen phase is going to also be\nof different duration depending\non which area of the body you're in.\nIt will vary a little bit  depending on\nwho you are, meaning\nfrom person to person.\nWe'll talk about the influences on the\nanagen and catagen phase in a moment.\nWhy is it important that it actually\nrecedes from the inside out?\nWell, that's important because as it does\nthat, there's actually a change\nin that bulb region down below,\nbecause normally, there's an interface,\nthere's a conversation that's occurring\nbetween the stem cell population,\nthe melanocytes, and the hair itself,\nand they support each other.\nRemember, there's blood vessels going\ninto that area or rather capillaries\nthat are feeding that area as well.\nAfter the catagen phase comes\nthe telogen phase, which means rest.\nThe telogen phase is a period in which no\nnew hair proteins are being\nadded by those stem cells.\nDuring that telogen phase,\nthat bulb down there at the bottom,\ninstead of being nice and oval and really\nhaving a lot of space in it with all these\ndifferent things like stem cells,\nstarts to pinch off\nfrom the little tube that comes  down\nfrom the surface  of the skin\nthat normally would have a hair in it.\nIt starts to pinch off.\nAt some point,  many hair follicles pinch\noff that bulb region,\nand it recedes and dies.\nWhen it recedes and dies,\nthe stem cell population\nand the melanocytes go with it.\nIn other words,\nthere is no longer a population of stem\ncells to give rise to more hair\nafter that telogen phase.\nThere's no longer melanocytes to pigment\nthe hair, and in fact,\nthe hair isn't there anymore,\nso there's no hair even to pigment,\nafter that telogen phase, unless\nit's a hair of a particular type such as\nthe hair on your scalp,\nwhich can then reenter the cell cycle,\nand get back into an anagen phase\nand regrow more hair from stem cells.\nThere are three critical stages\nof the life cycle of a hair that are\nrelevant to today's conversation.\nThere's the anagen phase during\nwhich the hair grows,\nthere's the catagen phase during which the\nhair actually starts to recede and die.\nThe protein is actually\ndisappearing from the bottom up.\nThen we have the telogen phase,\nwhich is the phase in which the stem cell\npopulation is what's called a semi\nquiescent, semiquiet, or completely\nquiescent,  where it's not active at all.\nThose three phases make up the life cycle\nof a hair, keeping in mind that for some\nhairs, they can reenter the life cycle\nand go back into the anagen phase,\nif there's stem cells there,\nand if there is oxygen there,\nand if there is sufficient blood support,\nand—and this is a very important and— if\nthere are the appropriate  hormonal\nsignals to support growth,\nand there is a reduction or an absence\nin the hormone  signals that actually\ntrigger that telogen phase.\nI make this point now because much\nof the rest of today's discussion is\ngoing to focus  on why particular hormones\nsuch  as dihydrotestosterone cause hair\nloss and why inhibiting things  like\ndihydrotestosterone can support\nthe preservation of hair  that you have\nand the regrowth of hair.\nTo make a long story very short,\nand then we'll get into some additional\ndetails that are relevant,\nand that I hope you'll stick around\nto listen to, dihydrotestosterone,\nwhich is a derivative  of testosterone,\ncauses changes in that bulb region\nwhere the stem cells reside.\nIt shortens or halt  the anagen phase\nof hair growth, and it extends and\npromotes the catagen and telogen phase.\nWhen we hear that, \"Oh\ndihydrotestosterone makes your hair fall\nout, or estrogen makes your hair grow,\"\nthere are real chemical people,\nor we should say biochemical\nlegitimate reasons as to why that is.\nBut it all comes back to this three\nphases of hair growth: the anagen growth\nphase, the catagen,\ncatabolic or hair loss phase,\nand the telogen phase,\nwhich is a rest period in which the hairs\ncan either come back,\nif it reenters the anagen phase\nor maybe it's over for good.\nHormones are the accelerator and the\nbrake on each one of those phases.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since\n2012, so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens once or usually\ntwice a day is that it gets me

contains\na number of adaptogens, vitamins,\nand minerals  that make sure  that all\nof my foundational nutritional\nneeds are met, and it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to AthleticGreens .com/\nhuberman, and they'll give you  five free\ntravel packs that make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens while you're\non the road in the car, on the plane,\net cetera, and they'll give you\na year's  supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain,\nthat's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nNow you have in mind the anatomy\nof the hair and the area from which it\ngrows,  and the stem cells, et cetera.\nThe fact that there's  capillary\ninnervation delivering oxygen and blood\nflow to the stem cells  that give rise\nto the hair, and that there are these\nthree critical phases of hair growth:\nanagen, catagen, and telogen.\nNow, let's talk about the accelerators\non hair growth and the\nbrakes on hair growth.\nThere are many accelerators on hair\ngrowth, but the first one that I really\nwant to underscore is blood flow itself,\nwhich equates to the delivery\nof nutrients and oxygen.\nThis is very important,\nand it explains a lot of the treatments\nfor halting and reversing hair loss.\nFor instance, one of the longest standing\ntreatments for halting and reversing\nhair loss  is so-called minoxidil.\nMinoxidil, sometimes also referred\nto by the brand name ROGAINE,\nwas actually a drug that was\ndeveloped to treat hypertension.\nThis is a cardiac drug that lowers blood\npressure,  and it does\nthat by causing vasodilation.\nIt allows more blood flow,\nnot just to the hairs on your scalp,\nbut to hairs everywhere on your body.\nIndeed, most people don't realize this,\nbut minoxidil won't just  slow  the loss\nof hair from your scalp,\nit is also effective at slowing\nthe loss of hair elsewhere in your body.\nHow does it do that?\nWell, you now know one\nof the major ways it does that.\nIt does that by extending the anagen\nphase, so it basically makes that phase\na bit longer, and does it make it\nmuch longer, which is why for most people\nwho are losing their hair quickly\nor who have already lost their hair,\nminoxidil alone is not going\nto be a sufficient treatment.\nHowever, minoxidil  has been shown to be\neffective at slowing rates of hair loss\nin people that are starting\nto experience some hair loss.\nI'll get into dosages and things\nof that sort a little bit later,\nbut right now I just want to really focus\non the logic of why people would take\nthis  drug,\nwhich is lowering hypertension\nat all as it relates to hair loss.\nThat might seem like crazy until you\nunderstand the anatomy and the growth\nof hairs, which you now do.\nThat's what minoxidil is doing.\nIt's creating more  blood flow\nto the hairs, which because minoxidil\ndoes have this positive effect,\nat least most people would like  to slow\ntheir rates of hair loss on their scalp\nanyway, it tells you that blood flow\nand delivery of oxygen and other\nnutrients from the blood is pretty\ncritical,  if not very critical, for the\nsupport  of the hair growth cycle itself.\nNow, again, we haven't talked at all about\nthe sorts of chemicals or the signals\nwithin the body, such as hormones\nthat actually direct the growth of hairs.\nHere, we're just talking about\na mechanical change,\nallow more blood flow  to the region,\nand thereby extend the anagen phase, which\nis exactly  what happens with minoxidil.\nNow, minoxidil does have other effects,\nand this is why dosing of minoxidil\nbecomes a little bit complicated and can\nbe a little bit tricky to troubleshoot.\nIt can greatly lower blood pressure\nor lower blood pressure just a little bit,\ndepending on how sensitive somebody\nis to that particular drug.\nOftentimes physicians will start people\non Minoxidil dosages that are very low.\nIdeally, that would be the case and then\nratchet it up in order to figure out\nwhere the minimal effective dose  or the\ncritical threshold is beyond which they\nstart experiencing  some pretty\nuncomfortable side effects,\nsuch as swelling of the ankles\nor headaches or dizziness.\nThese things can happen  with the use\nof Rogaine, aka Minoxidil.\nNow, Minoxidil has also been associated\nwith increases in the hormone prolactin.\nProlactin is a hormone that's\nreleased  from the pituitary.\nIt is a hormone that acts also as a bit\nof a neurotransmitter, like many hormones,\nand it tends to be antagonistic\nor an opposite to dopamine.\nDopamine is a neurochemical.\nIt's actually a neuromodulator,\nmeaning it modulates the activity  of a\nbunch  of neural circuits in the brain.\nIt also controls the release\nof various hormones in the body.\nDopamine is almost always associated with\nstates of motivation, pursuit, and drive.\nIt has a little bit  of a feel- good\nelement to it,\nwhich is why a lot of people think\ndopamine is associated\nwith reward and pleasure.\nBut it's really about energy,\nmotivation, and drive.\nDopamine and prolactin are,\nas I mentioned before,\nantagonistic to one another.\nThey're in sort of a push-pull.\nPeople who take Minoxidil,\nespecially if they're very sensitive to it\nor they take dosages that are too high,\nwill experience increases in prolactin\nthat in turn can cause things  like\nreductions in libido,\nreductions in overall feelings\nof well-being, apathy,\nand in some cases where the elevations\nin prolactin are more extreme,\nthey can experience, for instance,\nincrease in male breast tissue\ngynecomastia or even small bits\nof milk letdown, things of that sort.\nIn women who take Minoxidil,\nthe side effects are much like\nthe ones in experienced in men.\nSo there can be swelling,\nedema of the tissues\nbecause if you get too much  vasodilation\nand too, too much lowering of blood\npressure, that's not good.\nHeadaches, dizziness and so on.\nDosing of Minoxidil  is really important.\nIf somebody is going to use Minoxidil\nin order to try and slow or reverse hair\nloss, again, it mainly is going to be used\nto slow rates of hair loss,\nnot to actually reverse hair loss.\nThe really key thing  is\nto get that dosage right.\nThe ranges of Minoxidil  that you'll see\nsuggested and that people\nuse out there are vast.\nI should also mention  that there are two\nmajor routes by which people get\nMinoxidil to the hair follicle.\nOne is to take it systemically as a pill\nwhere it goes into the\ngeneral circulation.\nThe other is to take it\ntopically as a cream.\nThere are prescription  and non-\nprescription forms of Minoxidil\njust to further complicate things.\nBut the ranges of oral Minoxidil\nthat you'll see out there and that people\ntake range anywhere from 0.25 milligrams\nall the way up to five milligrams per day.\nThat's an enormous range.\nIt's like a 20-fold range.\nThe topical Minoxidil  is also\nfound in various concentrations.\nThe typical concentration  is going to be\na 5% concentration that people\nwill use once per day.\nTopical treatment with Minoxidil  at 5%\nconcentration is thought to just stay\nat the scalp,  but we now know that it\ncan go systemically,  it can get\ninto the general bloodstream.\nWhy that is should make complete sense\nto you because when you put something\non your scalp, I've already told you\nthat these little pits,\nthese little tubes that go down to those\nbulb regions below the skin  that have\ndirect access to the blood supply.\nWhen you massage something  into your\nscalp, it not only has the opportunity\nto get into your general circulation,\nit often does,\nespecially if it's something that's very\nwater-soluble and that way can get\ninto the capillaries and into the general\nbloodstream,  although topical treatments\nof which we're going to discuss,\na number of them today don't tend to get\ninto the general circulation as robustly\nas taking something\nby way of pill or capsule.\nMinoxidil works by way of increasing blood\nflow to the stem cell\nniche below the hair.\nThe dosage ranges  of the oral Minoxidil\nare tremendous, 0.25 milligrams, all the\nway up  to five milligrams once per day.\nThe dosage range of the topical solutions\ntends to be a little bit more confined.\nTypically, it's a 5% solution  and it's\nrecommended that people\nuse it one time daily, maybe twice daily.\nIt's also important, by the way,\nif you're going to take this route,\nthat you actually leave that solution\non the scalp for 3-5 minutes.\nThis is important and should make\ncomplete sense as to why it's important.\nYou can't just rub the stuff  into your\nhead and then rinse it off\nand expect it to be absorbed.\nIt actually needs to seep down into those\nhair follicles and access the niche.\nHow do people arrive  at the\ncorrect dosage for Minoxidil?\nWell, for better or for worse,  really,\nin some cases,\nit's accomplished by finding out that you\nhave an unwanted side effect, like\ndizziness or swelling  of your ankles or\nedema or I would hope this wouldn't be\nthe case,  but something that suggests\nthere's hyperprolactinemia.\nYou could get a blood test  to measure\nyour prolactin or you perhaps notice\na drop in libido or some lethargy.\nThese sorts of things that are common\nto reduce levels of dopamine,\nincreased levels of prolactin.\nI would hope that if people are working\nwith a physician or if they're not\nin taking Minoxidil, that they would\nstart  with the lowest possible dose.\nFor oral Minoxidil,\nthat would be 0.25 milligrams and then\nincrease it as needed  rather than jumping\nin right at five milligrams  because some\nof those side effects,\nin particular the fluid  retention\nand the hyper prolactinemia\ncan be pretty uncomfortable  and can\ndisrupt a lot of aspects of life\nthat most all of us consider desirable.\nWe're really focusing right now\non treatments that relate\nto the critical requirement for hair stem\ncells to receive  blood flow  in order\nto receive oxygen and nutrients,\nto get the hair to grow.\nThat's really what Minoxidil is about.\nIt's also what all of those anecdotes\nyou hear are all about, like\nmassaging the scalp or putting\nred light on the scalp.\nAlthough red light might do some other\nthings, in general,\nheating or lighting of the scalp  or\nmassaging of the scalp is really designed\nto increase blood flow to the scalp.\nNow, the reason Minoxidil works at all is\nbecause it is going to increase blood\nflow around the clock,\nand that's because people are taking it\ntopically and it's seeping\ninto the general circulation,\nor at least it stings somewhat\nrestricted  to the hair cell niche.\nOr they're taking it orally  and it makes\nit to that hair cell niche\nbelow the follicle.\nWhen we massage our scalp, however,\nthat's a transient thing,\nlike I massage my scalp right now,\nI'm no doubt\nincreasing blood flow to certain areas\nand probably decreasing blood flow\nto the areas I'm pushing down on.\nBut it's all temporary.\nI don't know many people that can massage\ntheir scalp enough during the day or long\nenough during the day  rather that it\nwould sufficiently increase blood flow.\nWith that said,\nit is clear that increasing blood flow\nto the scalp by way of reducing\nhypertension,\nwhich is effectively accomplished\nby broadening by expanding the blood\nvessels and capillaries,\nis an effective way to at least\nhold on to the hair that you have.\nIs it going to completely halt hair loss\nif you have a strong genetic\nbias towards hair loss?\nNo.\nIs it going to reverse hair loss?\nVery unlikely that it will.\nBut it can slow hair loss  or even\nmaintain the hair that you have.\nIf we were to take a step back and ask\nourselves what other sorts of drug\ntreatments  are out there besides\nMinoxidil, that increase blood flow\nand that might increase the rates of hair\ngrowth or more likely  increase\nmaintenance of hair that one already has\nby increasing blood flow to the niche.\nNowadays, there are more  and more doctors\nwho are familiar with this\nrequirement for blood flow.\nUnderstand the mechanisms\nby which Minoxidil works and understand\nthe vast desire out there for people\nto hold on to the hair they have\nand regrow hair and they are prescribing\nthings like low-dose tadalafil,\nso 2.5 milligram to five\nmilligram tadalafil.\nTadalafil was initially discovered\nas a drug to treat prostate health.\nIt was a drug that we now know  can\nincrease blood flow to the prostate\nand thereby offset some of the issues\nassociated with an aging prostate.\nHigher doses of tadalafil\nsometimes also referred to  by its brand\nname, which is Cialis,\nare used to treat erectile dysfunction,\nbut at the dosages that are used\nto increase blood flow to the prostate\nand that now a number of doctors are using\nto increase blood flow not just\nto the prostate but to all regions\nof the body, including the scalp,\nsuch as 2.5-5 milligram tadalafil.\nThis is something that I think  deserves\nattention because it falls under\nthe umbrella of increasing blood flow\nto the hair stem cell niche\nin order to maintain hair.\nIt is not something that most doctors\nare going to be familiar with as the way\nto reverse hair loss\nbecause it won't do that.\nBut the use of low-dose tadalafil\nto slow rates of hair loss is very much\nin a logical mechanistic sense,\nexactly the same as the logic of using\nMinoxidil to slow rates of hair loss.\nIt's all about increasing blood flow\nto support the stem cell niche\nbelow the hair follicle.\nThe critical requirement for blood flow,\noxygen and nutrients to the stem cell\nniche is also why you hear a lot nowadays\nabout the use of PRP,\nplatelet-rich plasma for trying to offset\nhair loss or even reverse hair loss.\nWe're going to do  an entire\nepisode about PRP.\nIt is pretty controversial  in certain\ncircles and well- accepted\nin other circles.\nA couple of key things\nto understand about PRP.\nFirst of all,\nit is being used  in multiple tissues for\ndifferent purposes in different clinics.\nFor instance,\nboard-certified physicians\nin the United States, Canada,\nand Europe are doing PRP injections\ninto ovaries to try and expand the number\nof healthy follicles and eggs  so\nthat people can conceive later in life or\neven earlier in life if they\ndon't have many follicles.\nPeople are getting PRP injections\ninto their joints in order\nto try and support joint health.\nPeople are getting PRP injections  into\njust about every tissue you can think of.\nHowever, PRP, despite what you may\nhave heard, is not stem cells.\nSomebody tells you they're injecting stem\ncells, they're either outside the US,\nCanada, or Northern Europe,\nor they're injecting something else.\nSo you want to really look into that.\nThe safety issues there are subject\ntotally deserving of an entire episode.\nI'm not necessarily opposed to the future\nof stem cells as a treatment,\nbut keep in mind that stem cells  are\ncells  that can give rise to lots of other\ncell types, and they are cells\nthat divide and replicate.\nThere's a name for that  when it happens\nin the adult body when\nyou don't want that.\nThat's called cancer.\nTumors are over-production of cells\nfrom stem cells when those stem cells\nordinarily should be quiescent.\nKeep in mind the difference\nbetween stem cells and PRP.\nPRP, platelet-rich plasma,\nagain, is legal in the US and many other\nplaces because it involves  drawing\nsomebody's  blood,\nspinning it down at a particular speed,\nwhich separates out different\ncomponents within the blood.\nThen taking the platelets  and re-\ninjecting those in a solution\nback  into the person's body.\nPlatelet-rich plasma or PRP is platelet\nenriched plasma from that person.\nBut the basis of PRP is really\nto encourage nutrient delivery\nto a particular region in the body  using\nsomebody's own platelets,\nbecause those platelets  are\nenriched for various nutrients.\nPeople are getting PRP\ninjections  into their scalp.\nThose are not stem cell injections.\nThose are PRP injections into the scalp\nwith some moderate success.\nThese are very expensive treatments.\nThey tend to be transiently successful.\nI'm sure there are people out there\nwho are going to say,\n\"PRP worked fabulously well\nfor me.\" That might be the case.\nI'm not going to dispute that.\nAnd I'm happy for you.\nAlthough there are not sufficient\nclinical data to suggest PRP as\na treatment right now,\nespecially given the cost, many thousands\nof dollars, many, many treatments.\nIt's also the case that the PRP\ninjections, when they work, might work\nfor reasons independent of the platelets.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, soon, we're going to talk about\na different type of treatment,\nwhich is a mechanical manipulation\nof the hair follicle, typically,\non the scalp, because that's typically\nwhere people want to regrow hair.\nI don't know many people who are trying\nto maintain or accelerate  or regrow\ntheir back hair, for instance.\nThey might be out there,\nbut I don't think there are a lot of them\nor their leg hair, for that matter.\nAlmost always,\nit's going to be scalp hair.\nAnd one way that people are doing\nthat  is through mechanical stimulation\nof the hair follicle and the stem cell\nniche using what's called micro-needling.\nMicro-needling, as the name suggests,\nis taking a bunch of little\nneedles  either in a little stamp.\nA little square or nowadays,\ntypically, it's a roller.\nIt looks like a paint roller,\nexcept it's got tons of little\nneedles  in rows all over that roller.\nThose needles range in length from half\na millimeter to 2.5 millimeters.\nMillimeters and one rolls\nthat over the scalp.\nIf you're thinking, ouch,\nthat probably hurts.\nIndeed, it can hurt a little bit or a lot,\ndepending on the thickness\nand the length of those needles.\nMicro-needling has been\nshown  to do two things.\nIt has been shown  to reactivate semi-\nquiescent populations of stem cells\nthat are in that telogen phase,\nputting them back in antigen phase\nand thereby stimulate more hair growth.\nIt has also, and this is I think,\nthe best use of micro-needling.\nIt has also been shown  to be a very\neffective augment for some of the hormone-\nbased hair regrowth tools\nand pharmacology that we're going\nto talk about in a few minutes.\nMicro-needling and PRP  have something\nvery critical in common,\nwhich is the needle,\nthe actual injection into the skin.\nFor those of you that are hearing this\nand thinking,\nwhy would disrupting the skin with needles\nactually, support hair growth or regrowth,\nwouldn't that just damage the follicle?\nWell, this gets into some of the, I think,\ninteresting, if not fascinating aspects\nof our biology,\nwhich is that all of the cells in our body\nreally can respond to both\nchemical and mechanical cues.\nWhen we hear needle injected into skin,\nwe think, oh, that must just be damaging\neverything, causing all\nsorts of inflammation.\nBut it turns out that low levels\nof inflammation caused by things like\nmicro-needling or PRP injections  or even\nthe introduction of any kind of fluid.\nFor instance, saline fluid injected\ninto a region can cause changes\nin the cells in that region, causing,\nfor instance, stem cell populations\nthat were waning to reactivate again,\ncausing telogen phase follicles that have\nmelanocytes and stem cells that are dying\noff but not completely gone\nto reenter the cell cycle.\nMicro-needling procedures, PRP injections,\nthings like Minoxidil,\nthey all kind of center around  this same\ngeneral theme of increasing blood flow,\nincreasing oxygen, delivery of nutrients,\nor in the case of micro-needling,\nincreasing inflammation just enough\nat that local site that certain cascades\nof biological function that relate\nto proliferation of stem cells or\nmaintenance of stem cell\npopulations  are kicked off.\nIt's sort of like reminding the cells\nin that area that they need to stay alive\nin order to replenish whatever is lost.\nSometimes a wound  can\nactually induce some healing.\nAlthough I do want to point out\nthat the micro part of micro-needling is\nabsolutely key  and this should be\nobvious  to you when\nyou think about scars.\nI don't know about you,\nbut I've never seen a scar with hair\ngrowing out of it, or if there was,\nit was probably like one hair.\nBut if you've ever seen a scar,\nsomeone had their appendix out  or if\nsomeone had a brain surgery,\nyou see that scar because there  is\nno hair growing out of it.\nSo the micro portion of micro-needling\nis extremely important.\nWe are not talking about  causing\nsignificant damage to a tissue in order\nto activate  that stem cell population.\nWe're talking about causing microdamage\nand micro levels of inflammation\nto stimulate growth.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin using micro-needling or micro-needling\nin combination with chemical treatments\nlike Minoxidil or some of the other\ntreatments we'll talk\nabout in a little bit.\nLike finasteride and caffeine.\nYes, believe it or not,\ncaffeine is being used to regrow hair.\nVery interesting.\nGet into that in a moment.\nBut if you're interested in using m\nicro-needling alone or in combination\nwith some of these other treatments,\nthere's a wonderful review that was\njust published this last year.\nWonderful,  because it's\nvery comprehensive.\nNot so wonderful.\nNot to the fault of the authors  because\nmost of the studies out there\non micro-needling are not superb.\nThere are ways of gauging the strength\nof a study mainly relate to their\nduration,  whether or not they\nwere control groups et cetera.\nBut the review itself  is excellent\nand the title of the review is M\nicro-needling and its Use in\nHair Loss Disorders: A Systematic Review.\nWe will provide a link to this\nin the show note captions and this review\ndid a very good job of highlighting both\nthe strengths and drawbacks of the various\nstudies looking at micro-needling.\nIt also explored the use of micro-needling\nin both men and women and of various\nages,  and it does appear to be the case\nthat micro-needling shows some positive\nbenefit in both men and women,\nregardless of age,\nespecially when used in combination\nwith the various other treatments\nthat we're talking about.\nI was also able to glean from this review\nand some of the papers described within it\nthat needle lengths  of about one\nmillimeter  to 2.5 millimeters seem to be\nmore effective  than\nshorter needle lengths.\nSo if you're scared of the needles\nand the needle lengths,\nkeep in mind that done properly,\nmicro-needling shouldn't be too painful.\nSome people experience  a little bit more\npain than others, but it's not\nconsidered  a very painful procedure.\nIt is, however, a procedure that can cause\nsome bleeding of the scalp,\nand that bleeding of the scalp can be\nvery apparent,\nespecially if it's in the front\nof the head as opposed to in the top\nof the head and hidden by some hair or if\nyou're already\nquite bald in a given region.\nKeep that in mind.\nI suppose one could wear a hat  or a wig\nor something of that sort if they\nwere  really self-conscious  about it.\nBut the micro-needling itself is causing\na physical disruption to the scalp,\nsome degree of bleeding, inflammation.\nAnd again, all of that is part\nof the process by which micro-needling\ncan actually improve hair growth.\nOf course, there's healing that occurs\nof the bleeding  and the\ndamage to the follicle.\nThis is a transient thing,\nbut understanding the cosmetic\nimplications in the short term as well as\nin the long-term  is\ncertainly worth knowing.\nOne thing that's very clear  is\nthat the combination of micro-needling\nand Minoxidil treatment together  is far\nmore effective than either\nof those treatments alone.\nIn addition,\nthe combination of micro-needling\nand Minoxidil has been shown to be\neffective in recovering\nwhat are called dead zones.\nThese are regions of the scalp that are\neither completely bald or mostly bald,\nfor which there is essentially\nno stem cell population there.\nThe combination of Minoxidil  plus\nmicro-needling is somehow able to recover\nthose stem cell populations  and allow\nnew hair to grow,\nalthough the growth of that hair\nin those dead zone regions can take\na very long  time,  30 to even 50 weeks.\nNeither Minoxidil treatment alone  nor\nmicro-needling alone has been shown to be\neffective in recovering  these so-called\ndead zones when those\ntreatments are done separately.\nThis, I would say,\nis a strong reason to consider combining\nmicro-needling  and Minoxidil as opposed\nto just doing Minoxidil\nor just micro-needling.\nI should also mention  that Minoxidil\ntreatment, if you pursue it,\nis likely something that you are going\nto have to do for the rest of your life.\nIf you want to hold on to the hair growth\nthat you obtain with Minoxidil or if you\nwant to maintain the hair that you are\nalready maintaining with Minoxidil.\nSome people have been successful\nin taking Minoxidil, maintaining some hair\ngrowth  or even stimulating some hair\ngrowth and then coming off Minoxidil.\nBut most everyone who goes on Minoxidil\nhas to stay on Minoxidil because when\nthey  cease taking Minoxidil,\neven if they're doing other treatments,\nthey lose the hair  that they gained\nwith Minoxidil, so that is\nan important consideration.\nThe decision to go on Minoxidil is likely\na decision to be on Minoxidil\nfor the rest of your life.\nI'd like to just take a brief break\nand  thank one of our\nsponsors, which is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of salt, sodium,\nmagnesium, and potassium, the so-called\nelectrolytes,  and no sugar.\nSalt, magnesium,\nand potassium are critical to the function\nof all the cells in your body,\nin particular to the function of your\nnerve cells, also called neurons.\nWe now know that even slight  reductions\nin electrolyte concentrations or\ndehydration of the body can lead\nto deficits  in cognitive\nand physical performance.\nLMNT contains  a science-backed\nelectrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams,\nthat's one gram, of sodium,\n200 milligrams of potassium,\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nI typically drink LMNT first thing\nin the morning when I wake up in order\nto hydrate my body and make sure I have\nenough electrolytes,\nand while I do  any kind of physical\ntraining and after physical training as\nwell, especially if I have been sweating\na lot, and certainly I drink LMNT\nin my water when I'm in the sauna\nand after going in the sauna because\nthat causes quite a lot of sweating.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's drinklmnt.com/huberman. To claim\na free element sample\npack with your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt\n, drinklmnt.com/huberman.\nSo, as you're probably starting\nto realize, there's a relationship between\nmechanical stimulation of the follicle\nand blood flow, both of which turn out\nto be  critical  for maintaining hair\nand for stimulating hair growth.\nNot surprisingly then, an increasingly c\nommon treatment  for hair loss is Botox.\nBotox is the brand name for what is\notherwise known as botulinum neurotoxin.\nWhat is botulinum neurotoxin?\nBotulinum neurotoxin,\nsometimes just called botulinum\nfor short, is a toxin that's a bacterial\ntoxin that serves  to cut the protein\nthat leads  to synaptic vesicle release.\nWhat in the world did I just say?\nWell, when your nerve cells communicate\nwith one another,\nthey do that by way of electricity,\nbut the electricity within those nerve\ncells,  those neurons,\ntriggers the release of chemicals\nfrom neurons into the synapse,\nthe little gap between neurons.\nThe release of those chemicals allows\nthe next neuron to be chemically active,\nor in some cases, it will suppress the\nelectrical activity of that next neuron.\nBotulinum neurotoxin serves  to cut\na protein present in neurons so\nthat neurons  cannot release the chemicals\nthat cause other neurons to be active.\nThis actually is pretty serious.\nIf you were to get botulinum neurotoxin\ninjected into your muscle you would be\nparalyzed because the nerves that control\ncontraction of the muscles would not be\nable to control the release\nof that chemical onto the muscle,\nwhich makes it contract.\nBotulinum neurotoxin  is commonly\nused in what's called Botox.\nBotox is something  most people are\nfamiliar with because people get it\ninjected  in and around their wrinkles\nbecause many wrinkles are triggered\nby not  just loss of tensile strength\nin the skin, but rather,\nthe nerves around the skin\nand in the skin are hyper contracted,\nwhich causes wrinkles.\nFor instance, I have crow's feet.\nI like to think that's because I've\nlaughed a lot and smiled a lot,\nand it's probably also because\nI've squinted a lot in my lifetime.\nI have crow's feet  because the nerves\nthere have pinched the skin  on either\nside  of my eyes and that's given me\nlittle creases there that are\nsometimes referred to  as crow's feet.\nBotox injections  can be applied\nto the scalp in order\nto relieve tension of the scalp.\nIn hearing that,  it should be obvious why\nBotox is being used to try\nand offset hair loss.\nIt's decreasing the squinting,\nif you will, or the tensile nature\nof the scalp skin so that more blood flow\ncan arrive at that stem\ncell follicle area.\nBotox treatment to the scalp is\nactually becoming pretty common.\nThere are a couple requirements\nwith this Botox treatment.\nFirst of all, it has to be done\nby somebody who's really skilled.\nThere are numerous images online\nand websites online of so-called Botox\nfails, where people have gotten too much\nBotox or the injections  have been done\ntoo deep or not at the correct locations\non people's face or scalp, and it can\ngive them  droopy  scalp or droopy eyes.\nAll sorts of cosmetic nightmares\ncan occur with Botox.\nThe second thing to understand is\nthat Botox does eventually wear off.\nThat botulinum neurotoxin\ndoesn't stick around forever.\nProvided it's done correctly\nat the correct dosages,\nit doesn't actually kill the neurons\nthat cause that tension of the skin,\nso Botox injections have\nto be done repeatedly.\nThe efficacy of Botox for offsetting\nhair loss is not clear.\nThere aren't a lot of large- scale\nclinical studies on this just yet,\nbut it does seem to be at least one\nreasonably safe alternative to things\nlike  Minoxidil, although I think if one\nwere to just want to increase blood flow\nto the scalp, things like low- dose\nTadalafil, which doesn't seem to carry any\nof the side effects that Minoxidil can\ncarry, we talked about  those side effects\nearlier, that would probably\nbe the better alternative.\nBotox is a fairly invasive procedure,\nbut some people opt for Botox treatment.\nIn fact, there is a syndrome called\ncutis verticis gyrata.\nSome of you have probably seen this.\nIt's more typical in men,\nalthough it does occur in women.\nIt literally means a lumping of the skin\non the scalp, or gyri of the scalp.\nGyri or gyrus  pertains to the Latin\nword knee, so it means bump or knee.\nAny time you hear the word gyrus\nin neuroscience or in biology,\nyou're talking about a bump.\nYou'll sometimes see people will have\nridges in the back where it looks as if\nthe skin was pushed together, kind\nof like a Shar-Pei dog, but on the scalp.\nPeople with cutis  verticis gyrata almost\nalways experience pattern hair loss.\nNow, part of the reason for that is\ncutis verticis gyrata\nis also associated with some androgen  or\ntestosterone- related hormone issues\nthat we'll talk about in a little bit.\nBut in addition to that,\nit has been shown that  relieving some\nof those gyrata by injections of Botox\nto allow those folds to sit flatter,\nA, is effective.\nIt can lead to less of those gyri,\nthose bumps, and can improve hair growth\nin those regions,\neven if those people don't  take on any\nadditional treatments\nto address the hormone issues.\nThat's really how people arrived at this\nunderstanding that Botox might be  a good\ntreatment in general for reducing the\nsquinting of the scalp  that can occur\nand the resulting  hair\nloss in those regions.\nI'd now like to turn our attention\nto the chemical variables that control\nthe duration  of the growth phase of hair,\nthe duration of that catagen phase,\nwhich is when that hair essentially\nrecedes from the inside out,\nand the quiescent or semi-\nquiescent telogen phase.\nThere are a couple of key chemical players\nhere that we should all be aware of.\nFirst of all, the growth factor IGF-1,\ninsulin growth factor 1,\nwhich is produced by the liver,\nbut that receives stimulation\nfrom the brain and pituitary to be\nreleased, is a strong\nregulator of hair growth.\nWe can think of it  as\nthe accelerator on hair growth.\nIt does that by extending  that anagen,\nor growth phase, for longer.\nIt doesn't necessarily speed up growth,\nbut it extends it  for\na longer period of time.\nIn addition, cyclic AMP,\nwhich is part of what's called a second\nmessenger pathway, in fact,\ncyclic AMP is a second messenger,\nis also a key player in stimulating\ngrowth of the hair follicle.\nNow, cyclic AMP does many different things\nin many different cell types in the body.\nIt really acts, as the name suggests,\nas a messenger between signals\nthat arrive at the surface of cells\nand transmitting  or conveying those\nsignals to things that happen  deep within\nthe cells, such as the turning\non and off  of various genes.\nWhen you hear second messenger, don't\nlet that confuse you  or overwhelm you.\nJust understand that the whole process\nof getting signals  from the outside\nof cells into the center of cells\nand controlling gene expression,\nfor instance,\ncausing a stem cell to continue to give\noff daughter cells, or causing a hair cell\nto continue growing for longer,\nthat whole process  is a bit like\na bucket brigade of handing off water or\na bucket from one component\nto the next, or along a chain.\nIt's like an assembly line.\nI think that's probably\nthe simplest way to think about it.\nFor sake of this discussion,\nIGF-1 is known to increase the growth\nof hair by extending that anagen phase,\nas is cyclic AMP.\nThose are going to be considered\nthe accelerators,\nat least in this conversation.\nThe brakes on hair growth are going to be\nthe things  that either shorten\nthe anagen  phase or that extend\nthe catagen phase or this quiescent phase,\nwhich is the telogen phase.\nThe two major brakes on hair growth\nthat we want to think about are PDE,\nwhich is a phosphodiesterase,\nanytime you hear -ase it's likely\nto be an enzyme, and TGF-beta-2.\nThis is a particular growth factor that,\nsomewhat counterintuitively,\ndoesn't stimulate growth,\nit actually stimulates lack of growth,\nor shortens growth.\nWith all of that in mind,\nand please do also keep in mind that you\ndon't need to remember all those specific\nterms, just understand that there are\nsome factors, like insulin growth factor\n1, that act as accelerators  on growth,\nand there are factors\nthat act as brakes on growth.\nWe can start to think about why,\nfor instance, half of all people\nby age 50  start to lose their hair.\nWell, they start to lose their hair\nbecause of something called androgen-\nrelated alopecia, which,\ntranslated to English,\nmeans testosterone and  testosterone-\nderivative induced hair loss.\nThis is true in men and women.\nHearing that, you should probably  be\nwondering the following thing:\nYoung men have higher levels\nof testosterone than old men, right?\nWell, the answer is yes,\nalthough some older men in their 40s,\n50s, even 80s, maintain testosterone\nlevels similar to many men\nin their 20s, but most don't.\nIt's a downward slope\nstarting at about age 40.\nHow steep that downward slope is depends.\nWomen, too, have testosterone.\nIn fact, women have higher levels\nof testosterone than they do estrogen.\nThat's right.\nA healthy woman has higher levels\nof testosterone than she does estrogen.\nHowever, women, on average,\nhave lower testosterone than most men,\nso they still have far more estrogen\nand far less testosterone than most men,\nbut the level of testosterone that they\nhave within their body is higher than\nthe level  of estrogen they have.\nAndrogens such as  testosterone  and its\nderivatives, such as dihydrotestosterone,\nwhich will be much the topic of what we're\ngetting into next,\ninhibit IGF-1 and cyclic AMP.\nAgain, androgens such as\ndihydrotestosterone inhibit,\nprevent the action of IGF-1 and cyclic\nAMP, which you just learned a few moments\nago, act to extend the anagen\nor growth phase of hair.\nWhich then raises the question, well,\nif young people, both male and female,\nhave higher levels of testosterone than\nthey do when they're older,\nwhy would people lose their hair\nwhen they're older and not younger?\nThe answer lies  in the conversion\nof testosterone  to dihydrotestosterone.\nTestosterone most people have heard of.\nDihydrotestosterone, or DHT,\nis made from testosterone.\nThere's an enzyme  called  5-alpha\nreductase that converts testosterone\ninto  dihydrotestosterone\nin both men and women.\nDihydrotestosterone  binds\nto the androgen receptor at five times\nthe affinity of testosterone,\nso it is the most powerful androgen\nin humans, and it is responsible\nfor a number of  things that we  all\nreally want and like, such as\nmental vigor,  physical vigor, strength,\nhealing capacity, drive,\nlibido, and on and on.\nDHT itself is not bad.\nIf we take a step back  and we\nacknowledge testosterone levels are\nhigher  in males and females at younger\nages as opposed to older,\nbut as they get older,\nthere is more 5-alpha reductase  activity,\nwhich is converting more\nof that  testosterone\nto dihydrotestosterone\nand dihydrotestosterone inhibits hair\ngrowth by reducing IGF-1 and cyclic AMP,\nwell, then we should all be aboard why it\nis that by age 50, about 50% of people\nexperience pattern hair loss.\nThat is androgen-dependent alopecia,\nbut translated to normal\nEnglish is pattern hair loss.\nIn a moment you'll understand  why some\npeople lose their hair from the crown\nregion in the back of the head,\nor back and top of the head,\nwhereas other people lose their hair\nin the front of their head,\nin the flanks,\nright on either side of the midline,\nor maybe in the midline\nand front altogether.\nThat's because different people,\ndepending on their genetic lineage,\nhave different patterns of androgen\nreceptors on their scalp.\nThe pattern of androgen receptors\nthat you inherit indeed does\ncome from your mother's side.\nThis is what gave rise to the the myth\nthat if you want to know  if you're going\nto go bald or not, just look\nat your mother's father.\nDoesn't quite work that way.\nIn fact, if you think about the logic,\nyou should really look at your mother's\nmother if you want to know your pattern\nof androgen receptors on your scalp.\nHowever, most women  don't lose as much\nhair from their scalp,\nor they have ways of covering up the hair\nloss in their scalp because their hair is\njust generally  longer or they're using\nother approaches, so that you never really\nget a clear picture of what the androgen-\ndependent hair loss was\nin your grandmother.\nNow, we don't want to go too far down\nthe genetics rabbit hole because,\nas you know,  you can't select your\nparents anyway, but if you want to know\nwhy, for instance,\nI'm losing a bit of hair on  either side\nof the midline in the front,\nit almost certainly  has to do\nwith the fact that I have a higher density\nof androgen receptors there,\nas opposed to, say,\non the crown of my head  where,\nfor whatever reason,\nmy hair seems to grow thickest.\nOther people lose hair on the crown,\nin the back and top, but not in the front,\nand some people will lose it all over.\nNow you understand why hair loss\noccurs in certain regions of the body.\nYou should also understand\nthat the androgen receptors on the face\nare also what are responsible\nfor beard growth.\nThis is where  it can get  a little bit\ntricky, but a lot of things  will start\nto make sense if you can understand\nthis and internalize this.\nIf you have a high density  of androgen\nreceptors on your face,\nwell then as your DHT levels  go up\nwith age, you will be able to grow\na thicker and thicker beard.\nIn fact, it is rare to see someone who can\ngrow a thick beard in their youth,\nbut not so much as they get older.\nIn fact, the reverse tends to be true.\nThe pattern of androgen receptors differs\nbetween the scalp\nand the face and the back.\nOn your back you have androgen  receptors\nand their DHT  stimulates hair growth.\nIf you know someone who has a very hairy\nback, or if you have a very hairy  back,\nthat means you have a high density\nof androgen receptors on your back.\nIf you have a beard and that beard is\nthick, well then you have a high density\nof androgen receptors on your face.\nHowever, a high density of androgen\nreceptors anywhere on your scalp is going\nto predispose those regions to androgen-\ndependent alopecia, or hair loss in those\nparticular regions,\nwhich is going to allow us to understand\nwhy all of the rest of the treatments\nfor halting hair loss\nand for stimulating hair growth,\nalmost all of those center on inhibiting\neither DHT directly, or 5-alpha reductase,\nthe conversion  of testosterone to DHT.\nNow I'd like to discuss the ways that one\ncan chemically adjust certain things\nwithin  the hair growth pathway,\nthings like IGF-1, PDE, TGF beta, etc,\nin order to stimulate hair\ngrowth  or halt hair loss.\nThe first thing on this list is actually\ngoing to be pretty surprising to a number\nof you,  and that's caffeine.\nWe all think of caffeine  as\na stimulant that we drink.\nI certainly drink coffee in Yerba Mate,\nthe occasional energy drink,\nthings of that sort.\nCaffeine does many things besides\nstimulate our central nervous system\nand make us feel less sleepy, however.\nOne of the things that caffeine  does  is\nit is a fairly  potent PDE inhibitor.\nBy being a potent PDE inhibitor,\nit indirectly stimulates IGF-1.\nWhy?\nWell, because PDE can suppress IGF-1,\nand by ingesting caffeine,\nor by applying topical caffeine ointment\nor cream  to the scalp,\nyou can suppress PDE sufficiently enough\nto increase IGF-1 and increase some hair\ngrowth, or at least maintain\nhair growth in that region.\nThis may come as a shock,\nit might seem a little bit esoteric\nor even  outside the margins  of typical\ntreatments, but head to head,\ntopical caffeine application can be as\neffective  as Minoxidil application\nwithout actually  lowering things  like\nblood pressure and potentially increasing\nprolactin and some of the other negative,\nlet's call them negative  because\nthey are,  side effects of Minoxidil.\nCaffeine ointments, and caffeine present\nin various hair treatments\nand creams, etc, is starting to become\na more  prominent theme out there.\nI will include a reference to caffeine\nand its uses for offsetting hair loss.\nKeep in mind that  topical caffeine\nointments shouldn't necessarily be applied\nevery single day, so this is the sort of\nthing  you might do three times a week.\nThe concentration of caffeine in\ndifferent ointments varies tremendously.\nMost of the studies  of caffeine\non the stem cell niches that control hair\ngrowth and extension of the anagen phase\nof hair growth have been\nperformed in vitro in a dish.\nAlthough there are some  clinical studies\nexploring this, they are not nearly as\nextensive in number or duration as\nthe studies of Minoxidil because this\napproach  just hasn't\nbeen around quite as long.\nHowever, when comparing  side effects\nof Minoxidil, cost of Minoxidil,\ncomparing the efficacy of caffeine\nand Minoxidil,\nI think caffeine as a topical treatment\nfor offsetting hair loss stands as\na pretty good choice if you're  going\nto start exploring this pathway.\nThere's no reason to think that if you\nwere to try the caffeine ointment and it\ndidn't work for you  or you didn't like\nit for some reason or you needed to stop\nit  for some reason,\nthat you couldn't stop it  safely,\nbecause it doesn't carry all the other\nblood pressure- related effects\nand prolactin emia effects\nthat Minoxidil does.\nIf you look out there  into the hair\nmaintenance and hair replacement\nliterature,\nand you  look at thetreatments that are\nbeing sold, don't be surprised\nto see caffeine there.\nAlso, don't be surprised when I tell you\nwhat I'm about to tell you now, which is,\nno, you can't simply  just drink  more\ncaffeine in order to accomplish\nthe goal of offsetting hair loss.\nIt is true that when you ingest\ncaffeine, it goes systemically.\nHowever, you have so many adenosine\nreceptors throughout your body.\nThose adenosine receptors,\nand the parking of caffeine in those\nadenosine receptors,\nis the main way  in which  caffeine\nexerts its stimulatory effects,\nmaking you feel less sleepy.\nIt does that because then  adenosine can't\nhave its effects,\nwhich are to make you sleepy.\nWell, those adenosine receptors soak up\nso much of the caffeine  that you would\ningest orally that very,\nvery little would make it  to the scalp\nand to the hair follicles\nat the concentrations that you would want,\nso that's why you have to rely\non the  application of these caffeine\nointments about three times a week.\nKeep in mind that  no one has really\nexplored the dosages of caffeine\nin these ointments in a systematic way.\nWe are still in  the early stages of all\nthis, but I do think it's important\nto mention caffeine because of the lower\nincidence of side effects,\nat least reported side effects,\nand the general safety margins,\nand the head to head essentially\ncomparable efficacy  with Minoxidil\nbecause  Minoxidil has\na bunch of other issues.\nNow keep in mind that  both Minoxidil\nand caffeine are generally used as\na preventative for reducing\nhair loss over time.\nThey are not expected,\nand they do not, as far- as far as we\nknow, create new hair growth\nto any sufficient degree.\nIf any of you have used caffeine,\nointments or minoxidil and observed  new\nhair growth that was robust,\nplease put that in the comment section.\nI'd be curious about those experiences,\nbut as far as I know\nand from  the clinical  literature that I\nread, there's no examples of that.\nOne other point about caffeine.\nIt does appear that caffeine can not only\nindirectly stimulate IGF-1 and the antigen\nphase of hair cell growth by way\nof reducing PD and TGF beta.\nBut it also seems to reduce apoptosis\nwhich is naturally occurring cell\ndeath of that stem cell niche.\nWe've been talking a lot about\nthe antigen or growth phase of hair.\nWe also talked about the catagen or\nthe recession of that hair\nfrom the inside out.\nBut remember that third phase,\nthe telogen phase, where that whole bulb\ndown  at the bottom, the bulge,\nas it's called,\ngets pinched off and the whole thing dies\nand takes the stem cells\noff to the grave with it.\nIt appears that caffeine can offset\nthe death of that niche and potentially\nmaintain  the stem cell population longer,\nmaking caffeine a really good choice\nto think about in conjunction\nwith  the various chemical treatments\naimed  at directly attacking the DHT\npathway  that we'll talk about next.\nSo there's one very direct way\nto increase hair growth and maintain\nthe hair  that you  have on your head,\nand that's to increase IGF-1.\nThat can be accomplished through\nprescription drugs such as growth hormone\nand things that stimulate the release\nof growth hormone and IGF-1.\nKeep in mind, growth hormone  is released\nfrom the anterior  pituitary during\nthe first hours of sleep,\nespecially when you haven't eaten\nanything  for the two hours prior\nto sleep, and especially  when\nyou get regular bedtimes.\nYes, this is a real thing.\nIf you are going to sleep at variable\nbedtimes, especially if you go to sleep\nmuch later  than your usual habitual\nbedtime, you will miss that growth\nhormone  pulse that normally occurs\nin the first 2-3 hours of sleep.\nThis does not mean  that you need to be\nneurotic about getting to sleep\nat the exact same time every night.\nThere's probably  a plus or minus 30-\nminute window,\nand it doesn't mean  that you can't stay\nout late or have a bad night's sleep\nevery once in a while or get woken up.\nYour hair isn't going to fall out.\nMy dad's story notwithstanding,\nyour hair isn't going to all\nfallout because of that.\nBut you do want to try and get\nthat  natural growth\nhormone release each night.\nAnd as I mentioned,\nthere are prescription  approaches\nand those are growth hormone itself.\nThings like sermorelin, which is\na peptide that increases growth hormone.\nIt's actually a secreted dog.\nIt causes the secretion of growth\nhormone and thereby increases in IGF-1.\nThis is well documented.\nBoth growth hormone and IGF-1, as I\nmentioned,  are available by prescription.\nThey are not without their side effects.\nThey do cause growth of all tissues.\nThey do increase height in children,\nThey increase bone mass and density.\nThey can increase mainly fat loss,\nnot so much muscle size,\nbut they can increase leanness and they\nincrease hair growth,\nThey can increase turnover of skin,\nthey can make skin look more youthful.\nAll these things sound wonderful.\nAnd yet they also have problems because\nthey can increase  growth of small tumors\nthat normally might be eliminated.\nSo there is an increased cancer risk\nwith growth hormone treatments and IGF-1\nor anything that increases IGF-1  such as\nsermorelin or ipamorelin, any of the\npeptides  that you hear about nowadays.\nThat said, a number of people  are using\nsermorelin as an indirect way to increase\nIGF-1 and thereby\nto increase hair growth.\nIt does seem to be fairly effective\nin doing that, especially when done\nin conjunction with  other\ntreatments that we'll talk about.\nBut keep in mind, these are prescription\ndrugs and they do carry their own risks.\nThe other thing about stimulating\nthe natural production of IGF-1 is that,\nas its name suggests,\ninsulin growth factor one,\nit is insulin dependent in many ways,\nif not for its secretion,\nthen for its action at the hair\nfollicle and stem cell.\nSo one of the things  you really want\nto pay attention to is to avoid being\ninsulin resistant, or rather you\nwant to try  to be insulin sensitive.\nSo if you're carrying  a lot of excess\nbody fat, if you're obese  or if you have\ntype two diabetes,\nmeaning your insulin resistant,\nyou're going to want to deal with that.\nThere are a number of prescription\ntreatments to deal with that nowadays.\nPeople are very excited about all the GLP\none agonists, but in addition to that,\nregular cardiovascular exercise\nand resistance exercise,\nmaking sure that your body fat percentage\nis not in excess of where it needs to be.\nEveryone has a slightly different idea\nof where it needs to be,\nboth cosmetically and for health.\nSo that's a conversation between you\nand your doctor and you and you frankly.\nBut you want to avoid being insulin\nresistant because being insulin resistant\nand being obese can\nindeed lead to hair loss.\nThere are many people out there  who are\nnot obese who nonetheless are experiencing\nhair thinning and hair loss because they\nare insulin resistant by way\nof reduced IGF-1 activity.\nThere are a few supplements.\nSo these are over-the-counter\nsupplements  such as myo-i nositol,\ntaken at dosages of about  900 milligrams\nbefore  sleep, which by the way,\ncan also assist in sleep or things like\nberberine or metformin, which are\nknown  to improve insulin sensitivity.\nEach and every one of these has its own\nprofile of positive and negative effects.\nThe lowest number of side effects  is\nassociated with 900 milligram myo-i\nnositol  taken about 30 minutes before\nsleep, mostly because it can make people\na little bit drowsy\nand it does aid sleep  in some  really\ngreat ways,\nbut really exercise and maintaining\na healthy  nutritional program\nare also going to be key.\nYou just can't discard those.\nBerberine, which is a substance  made\nfrom tree bark is sometimes\ncalled  the poor man's metformin.\nMetformin being the equally effective\nprescription version of berberine.\nOr put differently,\nberberine is the non-prescription but\nequally effective version of metformin.\nKeep in mind that  both berberine\nand metformin dramatically\nreduce blood sugar levels.\nAnd so if you're not going to take  them\nwith carbohydrates, it can lead\nto some feelings of discomfort.\nThat's why I'm not a fan of them.\nBut if your goal is to really improve\ninsulin sensitivity,\nthey are considered very potent tools\non the list of things that can do that.\nThe other thing that's really important\nfor maintaining proper hair growth,\nthis antigen phase,\nis that you need sufficient iron.\nThis is because iron and ferritin play\na key role in the cell growth pathways\nthat go from the stem cells\nto the stimulation of keratin\nwithin the hair itself.\nI don't have time to go into  this\npathway in a lot of detail, but you can\nhave your blood levels  of iron measured.\nThis turns out to be pretty important\nbecause you don't just want to start\npopping iron supplements because too much\niron can be toxic,\ntoo little means you're anemic.\nFor women,  the levels of iron  that you\nwant are somewhere between 25 and 100.\nAnd for men, somewhere between 30 and 150.\nFortunately,  the tests or the blood\ntests  for iron are usually a very\ninexpensive add to your\ncurrent blood panel.\nSo if you're going in for a blood panel\nfor LDL, HDL, typical things,\nor if you're doing the more elaborate\nhormone testing,\nwhich I do recommend people do if they\ncan afford it or if their insurance covers\nit, do ask for an iron test as well.\nAnd if your iron is low,\nyou may need to supplement your iron.\nIf your iron is too high,\nthat's not good either.\nBut iron plays a key role in the antigen\nphase of hair growth, so you want to make\nsure  you at least have sufficient iron.\nAnd if you don't, you want to make sure\nthat you're getting it from nutrition\nand or supplementation.\nEarlier, we were talking\nabout dihydrotestosterone.\nDihydrotestosterone,\njust to jog your memory,\nis a form of testosterone that combine\nthe androgen  receptor at five times\nthe affinity of regular testosterone.\nBoth men and women have a lot\nof testosterone relative to estrogen.\nIt just so happens that men tend to have\nmore testosterone than women do overall.\nBut both men and women, as they age,\nconvert more of the testosterone they\nhave  to dihydrotestosterone\nand dihydrotestosterone does two things\nthat are bad  for hair\nmaintenance and hair growth.\nFirst of all, it shortens  the antigen\nphase, that growth phase.\nWhatever hair is going to grow is going\nto occur over a shorter period of time.\nSecond of all,  because  of the presence\nof androgen receptors on the stem cell\nniche area and around it,\nit actually miniaturize the follicle\nand the stem cell niche.\nIn other words,  it makes the population\nof cells that give rise to more hair\nprotein smaller and can\neliminate it altogether.\nAnd that is why anything  that reduces 5-\nalpha reductase is going to reduce DHT,\nis going to maintain or extend the growth\nphase, the antigen phase of hair growth\nand is going to offset  or prevent some\nof the telogen phase, the pinching off\nand the removal of that stem cell niche.\nNow, one substance that  we know can\ninhibit 5-alpha reductase,\nalthough it does it pretty weakly is saw\npalmetto, which is an extract\nof the saw palmetto berry.\nTo be honest, I don't know how\nthis was initially discovered.\nIf anyone knows,  please put\nit in the show note captions.\nWhen I looked online I found a bunch\nof conflicting stories about who was\nthe first person  to start extracting the\nextract of the saw palmetto berries.\nSo I have no idea\nwhich one of those is true.\nMaybe somebody can tell me.\nThe good thing about  saw palmetto\ntreatment is that it is known to have\nvery few,  if any, side effects.\nThere might be some side effects\nin about 1% of people, but it's not\nassociated with a lot of side effects.\nIt's also known that when taken  at about\n300 milligrams per day and here it\ndoesn't  have to be that strict.\nMost of the studies that I explored\ninvolved taking anywhere from  200-\n500 milligrams of saw palmetto,\nbut most of them focused  on about\n300 milligrams of saw palmetto per day,\ndivided into two or three doses.\nWhy?\nWell, it has a relatively short half-life,\nmeaning it's going to get cleared\nfrom the bloodstream and more importantly,\nits biological action is\ngoing to be very short-lived.\nSo if you can get a hold of  50 or 100-\nmilligram capsules or tablets\nof saw palmetto and divide those up,\ntake them in the morning,\nafternoon and evening,\nor even just in the morning and evening\nto achieve a total of about\n300 milligrams per day.\nThat's going to very likely help you hold\non to some of the hair that you would\nhave otherwise lost,\nmaybe even grow some new hair.\nAnd I say maybe give you  some new hair\ngrowth because  saw palmetto is not\nknown  to be a particularly robust\ntreatment for the reversal of hair loss.\nIt's known to have some effect,\nbut it's generally taken in conjunction\nwith a bunch of other things.\nAnd so it's really hard to tease out\njust what amount of hair growth or\nprevention of hair loss is  due\nto  saw palmetto specifically.\nBut I mention it here  because\nthe mechanism of action is logical\nand fairly well-known,\nwhich is this week effect  in reducing 5-\nalpha reductase and thereby reducing DHT.\nSo again, because it has  relatively low\nside effects, even though it's not super\neffective  and because it's fairly low\ncost and it's available over the counter,\nI felt it was important to include.\nNow, as soon as people hear things like\nsaw palmetto berry, they're probably also\nthinking, \"Oh boy,\nhere comes all the herbals.\" Now keep\nin mind that there are some herbal\ncompounds that have pretty\nrobust biological effects.\nAnd we talked before in our optimizing\ntestosterone episodes about things like\nTongkat Ali and  Fadogia agrestis,\nwhich taken incorrect dosages\nand in the correct way,\ncan be pretty  potent for increasing\nluteinizing hormone and free\ntestosterone  that can have huge effects.\nIt's not like taking exogenous anabolic\nsteroids, but they can have real effects.\nAnd so herbal compounds can be potent.\nHowever, I do acknowledge that there is\na vast market out there of herbal\ncompounds  and plant-based\ncompounds that people are arguing.\nMostly the people who sell them are\narguing can increase hair growth.\nThere are some decent\nstudies of these things.\nThe hard part about studying these herbal\ncompounds and these plant-derived\ncompounds  for increasing hair growth is\nthat they are often taken\nin combination with one another.\nIn fact,  most of the hair growth\nsupplements that involve these herbal\ncompounds  and plant compounds include 5\nor 10,  sometimes even\nmore things altogether.\nSo teasing out which ones are effective\nand which dosages are effective\nis nearly impossible.\nThere are just too many variables.\nYou will hear, for instance,\nthat green tea extract, Reishi Mushroom,\npumpkin oil, zinc, curcumin, all\nof these things can increase hair growth.\nPerhaps the only thing on that list\nthat makes logical sense with respect\nto the biochemistry is that curcumin is\nknown to, in some people,\nbe a potent inhibitor of 5-alpha reductase\nand DHD so much so that I can personally\nsay for me  I once took curcumin,\nturmeric, it's also called in high dosage.\nThis is about a gram to 2 gram capsules\nand I felt absolutely terrible.\nI mean, just dreadful.\nI don't care if it allowed me  to keep\nmy hair forever, I would rather\nlose  all my hair three times over.\nI guess that means  it\nwould have grown back.\nI'd rather lose all my hair.\nLet's just put it that way\nthan ever take curcumin or\nturmeric in high dosages again.\nIn saying that, I know that many people\ntake turmeric and curcumin and really like\nits anti-inflammatory properties\nand don't  experience any side effects.\nI just happen to be particularly sensitive\nto curcumin by way of this DHT pathway.\nI know this by way of blood work, so I'm\nnever going to hear that stuff again.\nThat said, a lot of these herbal compounds\nand cocktails probably  will have some\nminor marginal,\ninfinitesimally small,\nsomewhere in that range effect\non maintaining hair growth  or\nin stimulating new hair growth.\nIt's just that there  really aren't\nclinical studies\nto support any one of them.\nAnd that's why I singled out saw palmetto\nas one of the few\nfor which the biochemical pathway\nof inhibiting 5-alpha reductase\nand the low incidence of side effects\nand the fact that many people have used it\nwith some degree of success\nmakes it a standalone.\nI wouldn't say recommendation,\nbut a consideration.\nAnother commonly discussed and use\ncommercial compound for offsetting hair\nloss and stimulating hair\ngrowth is ketoconazole.\nSometimes this is known as  Nizoral where\nNizoral is   the brand name of a shampoo.\nKetoconazole is an antifungal  that was\ninitially developed to treat\ndandruff  and severe psoriasis.\nKetoconazole has been shown to be\neffective in increasing hair number.\nIt's also been shown to be effective\nin increasing hair diameter,\nwhich is somewhat surprising because one\nof the common side effects of ketoconazole\nis drying, thinning and brittle hair.\nSo what's going on there  is\na little unclear.\nWe'll return to that in a moment.\nThe mechanism of action\nfor ketoconazole is pretty interesting.\nRemember earlier we were talking  about\nthe sebaceous gland and the production\nof sebum,   that oily stuff\nwhose very name seems  to evoke\ndisgust in certain people.\nWell, ketoconazole can disrupt  some\nof the fungal growth that frankly,\nwe all have on our scalp all the time.\nI know this is a surprise to many of you,\nbut you are constantly bombarded\nwith viruses, bacteria\nand funguses all the time.\nBut we managed to battle  those off\nwith our immune system,\neither by physical barriers such as\nan oil barrier like the sebum\nor through antimicrobial action.\nChemical approaches  our immune system,\nthe sebum, etc,\nketoconazole acts as an antifungal\nthat in some way seems to reinforce\nthe properties of sebum at keeping\nout other fungal infections.\nAnd the net effect, at least as far as\nwe know, is a mild reduction in DHT.\nNow exactly how this\nhappens isn't really clear.\nWhat is clear is that the use\nof ketoconazole shampoo is\n2-4 times per week with a scalp contact\ntime of about 3-5 minutes has been shown\nto give about an 80%  response rate\nof maintaining  hair\nthat would otherwise be lost.\nSo that's pretty dramatic, 80%.\nWhat is less clear is  whether or not\nketoconazole shampoo can actually\nstimulate new hair growth.\nBut as you're probably  starting\nto realize,\nthis is always a bit of a tough thing\nto disentangle maintenance of hair\nthat you would have lost\nversus new hair growth.\nCertainly,\nthat's an easy thing  to disambiguate if\nyou have a patch of scalp  where there is\nabsolutely no hair,\nthese so-called dead zones that you\ncan resurrect with certain treatments.\nBut what about areas of your\nscalp  where hair is thinning?\nSo, for instance, on the top of your head,\nthis is where many women will first\nexperience pattern, hair loss.\nAlopecia is right at their midline,\nespecially  if they\nhave a part right there.\nThey'll start to notice that under very\nbright light,\nfluorescent lights  in particular,\nthey'll notice a thinning  of their\nhair there or  in the forehead region.\nThey'll start using  ketoconazole shampoo.\nAgain, the typical recommendation  is 2-4\ntimes per week with a scalp contact time\nof 3-5 minutes and really rubbing\nit in  and then rinsing it out.\nYou don't need to be super vigorous,\nbut you want to make sure  that it gets\ndown into the follicle and around\nthe follicles,  not just sitting on top\nof the hair,\nwhich is going to be especially\nimportant  for people who have\nlong hair to really massage it in.\nWell, they will experience a growth\nof hair in that particular region\nthat almost certainly were due\nto miniaturization of the hair follicle\nand reduction of the total population\nof stem cells in that follicle as opposed\nto complete  loss\nof the stem cell population.\nThe reason we say this is that there's no\nreason to think that ketoconazole can\nactually stimulate\nIGF-1 or activate growth itself.\nIt's probably offsetting some\nof the reductions in the antigen phase\nand some of the exacerbation\nof the telogen phase.\nNow, if you decide to use ketoconazole as\nan approach to offsetting hair loss,\nit's very important that  you get a hold\nof a shampoo that's at least 2%\nconcentration of ketoconazole.\nThis is important because a lot\nof the ones that are available out there,\nespecially online,\nare going to be 1% or lower.\nSo you want to try and obtain\na ketoconazole shampoo of 2% or higher\nconcentration of ketoconazole because\nit has other things in it, of course.\nI should mention that there are occasional\nside effects with ketoconazole.\nThe rates of side effects  from  the meta\nanalyzes and reviews that I read were\nsomewhere between 1% and 8%  of people\nwill experience some side effects,\nbut those side effects\ntend to be pretty mild.\nThings like irritation of the scalp,\nthings like thinning and brittleness\nof the hair that sometimes can be offset\nby using shampoos that  contain\nthings like biotin.\nI know many people  are probably curious\nabout biotin, which is a protein that can\nbe incorporated into the keratin.\nWhether or not different biotin enriched\nshampoos can really enhance the total\namount of biotin that gets  incorporated\ninto the hair isn't clear,\nbut it is clear that having sufficient\nbiotin around is important.\nSo if you get a little bit extra\nfrom your shampoo,\nyou can imagine how that would  \"tap\noff\"  the amount  of biotin in that hair.\nAnd there are people out there saying\nthat by biotin-enriched shampoos\nhave done wonders for them.\nWho knows?\nI'm not going to dispute their experience.\nSo if you're going to use ketoconazole,\nkeep in mind that the more typical brand\nnames that are out there,\nyou know which ones they are,\noftentimes don't have 2%  or if they do\nhave 2%, they can be very drying\nand lead to brittle hair.\nThere are newer and now fortunately,\na greater variety of ketoconazole\ncontaining shampoos.\nWe as a podcast and I don't have  any\naffiliation to any of these,\nbut I will provide a links to a couple\nof  the more prominent ones that are known\nto have 2% concentration of ketoconazole,\nas well as some other things in them known\nto offset some of that dryness\nand brittleness that ketoconazole\nshampoos can trigger.\nSo by now, I think it will be abundantly\nclear why inhibiting  5-alpha reductase\nand thereby reducing DHT should increase\nhair growth because of the negative\nimpact  that DHT has on the hair follicle.\nThe major player in this whole story\naround inhibiting 5-alpha reductase\nand reducing DHT to maintain or increase\nhair growth is going to be finasteride\nand its close cousin, dutasteride.\nFinasteride is effective in reducing DHT\nbecause of its actions in reducing\nthe type two isoenzyme  or\nisoform of 5-alpha reductase.\nIt turns out there's three different\nisoforms or what are sometimes called\nisoenzymes of 5-alpha reductase.\nThis is getting pretty\nfar down in the weeds.\nWhat I think most of you  just need\nto know is that finasteride reduces DHT,\nthat's the net product of finasteride\nand in doing so, it can increase\nhair count by as much as 20%.\nPretty remarkable if you think about it.\nIn addition, finasteride treatment done\nproperly, which we'll define in a moment,\ncan reduce hair loss in 90%\nof all people that take it.\nThat is near staggering.\nI mean, there aren't many pharmaceuticals\nOut there that have that\nefficacy, really dramatic.\nIn addition, it's known to increase hair\nthickness by about 20- 30% overall,\nso not just create new growth of hairs,\nand thicker hairs, but whatever hair you\ndo happen to have on your head,\nit can further thicken those.\nThe finasteride story is one,\nI think, of general success.\nIt really seems to improve hair  growth,\nand help you hold  on to\nthe hair that you have.\nThe issue with finasteride is twofold.\nFirst of all, it is known to have some\npretty significant side effects if it's\nnot dosed properly,\nand in particular  populations of people.\nThis is because there is a wide  variation\nin the amount of the different\nIsozymes that people make.\nThis is why I brought up\nthe Isozymes earlier.\nSome people make more of Isozyme one\nand three, some people make more of\nIsozyme two and three,\nand every variation thereof.\nWhen people take finasteride,\nsome people are very strong responders,\nand they achieve really effective\nhair regrowth and maintenance of hair.\nOther people less effective,\nalthough still pretty impressive.\nBut the catalog of side effects\nthat people experience\nat a given dose, varies widely.\nThere's a lot of trial\nand error that has to take place.\nAlso, I should point out that finasteride\ncomes in two major forms.\nThere's an oral form\nand there's a topical form.\nThis is not unlike our\ndiscussion of minoxidil earlier.\nTopical finasteride is typically taken\nin 1% solution or ointment and rubbed\ninto the head, sometimes it's now also\nincorporated into shampoos,\nbut typically it's put into a solution\nthat people rub into their head,\nand it is thought that the 1% solutions\nare equivalent to one mg\nof systemic finasteride.\nNow we need to take a step back and ask\nwhy was finasteride\ndeveloped in the first place?\nWell, finasteride, as a fairly potent five\nalpha reductase inhibitor,\nit's great at lowering DHT.\nIt was developed for treatment\nof prostate enlargement and various\nissues  of the prostate that are\nassociated with elevated DHT\nthat occurs with age.\nThe topical finasteride were designed\nwith the hope that the finasteride would\nmake it into the hair follicle,\nand would inhibit DHT there  and allow\nfor more growth of the hair,\nwhich apparently it does,\nbut not make it into the systemic\ncirculation,\nor at least not at concentrations\nsufficient enough to cause as many\nside effects as with the oral dosing.\nNow, the problem is,  it does\nmake it into systemic circulation.\nThe issue is also,\nthat topical application  of finasteride\nis harder  to dose than oral finasteride.\nI'm not saying you should be taking oral\nrather than topical finasteride,\nbut keep in mind  that the dosages\nof finasteride that have been shown to be\neffective for inducing hair  growth,\ncover an enormous range.\nAs low as 0.01mg per day and as high as\nfive mg per day, which is\na just staggering range.\nNow, when trying to simplify the problem\nof how much finasteride to take,\neither by way of oral tablet,\nor by way of topical solution,\nwe can get a bit of leverage on this\nby thinking about how much DHT\nreduction occurs as a function of dose.\nThere, finasteride shows this really\ninteresting, what's called\nlogarithmic distribution.\nWhat it means is that,\nfor a dosage of 0.01mg of finasteride,\nyou're going to achieve  approximately\n50% reduction in DHT,\nand that's systemic DHT,\nso this is a blood draw   measuring your\nDHT, then taking 0.01mg of finasteride.\nAgain, 0.01, very low dose of finasteride,\nrepeated a couple of weeks,\nmeasure people's DHT in their blood again,\nand you see that it's reduced by 50%.\nHowever, at increasing dosages  of 0.2mg,\none mg,  five mg of oral finasteride per\nday, over the same period of time,\nthe increase or I should say\nthe reduction  in dihydrotestosterone,\ndoesn't increase linearly.\nIt's not that you go from 50%-6 0%-75%-\n100% with each increasing dose,\nit tapers off, it flattens out.\nIt tends to increase a little bit,\nbut it's a gradual slope  increasing\nas you head from 0.2mg out to five mg.\nWhat this means is that given\nthat reducing DHT can cause various side\neffects, sexual side effects,\nreductions in either sexual function or\nsexual drive, as well as overall drive\nand motivation,\nsometimes even some depressive symptoms\nthat everything points to taking\nthe lowest effective dose of finasteride\nand starting with a very low dose\nof finasteride because low doses\nof finasteride, even at that 0.01mg taken\norally daily,\nare already leading to a 50%  reduction\nin dihydrotestosterone and thereby taken\nfor a long  enough period of time,\nshould offset hair loss\nand stimulate hair growth.\nOne of the problems, however,\nis that people will start taking\nfinasteride at a low dose 0.1mg or 0.2mg,\nmaybe even 0.01mg,\nand there will be a reduction  in their\nDHT, but because of the long duration\nof that antigen phase,\nthey don't see a lot of change  in hair\ngrowth in the first month or even two\nmonths, and so what they end up doing  is\nincreasing their dosage and then they\nstart to see hair growth, but then they\nstart to experience more side effects.\nNow the side effects of oral finasteride\nare serious enough and common enough\nin people that take finasteride\nthat the topical solutions were developed,\nbut there are two one needs to exercise\ncaution because if we are going\nto translate between topical finasteride\nand oral  finasteride,\nwith the understanding that topical\nfinasteride can actually make it\ninto the systemic circulation,\nwe need to look at what's been shown\nin clinical studies,\nwhich is that for instance,\ntaking one ml of 0.25% finasteride applied\nto the scalp, this is a very typical\nrecommendation, translates to the same\nthing  that would be achieved\nwith 2.5mg of oral finasteride.\nWhen I say translates to the same thing,\nwhat I mean is it leads  to the same\nconcentrations in the blood.\nNow consider that 0.2mg, 0.2mg\nof finasteride in the blood is known\nto be effective  in generating new hair\ngrowth and maintaining hair that one\nalready has when they start the treatment.\nIf you think that the topical\nfinasterides are actually creating lower\noverall systemic concentrations\nof finasteride, that is\nnot necessarily the case.\nAgain, one ml of topical  finasteride\nat 0.25% leads to a 2.5mg concentration\nin the blood, when the effective dose\nwithin the bloodstream by taking it orally\nas a pill is 0.2mg.\nThat might not seem like a big deal\nto you, although it is a big deal, right?\nWe're talking 2.5mg versus 0.2,\nbut it is a huge deal when you consider\nthat the side effects of finasteride\nincrease as you increase the concentration\nof finasteride in the bloodstream.\nWhere does this leave us?\nShould people who are interested\nin taking finasteride take the oral form\nat low dose or take the topical form\nand simply try and apply it less often or\nguess at what their  systemic\nconcentration  of finasteride is.\nWell, it's going to vary\nfrom person to person.\nSome people are very sensitive\nto finasteride and not in the good sense.\nThe side effects just really show up\nquickly and they tend to be dramatic.\nOther people, not so much.\nThe dosage recommendations  that I was\nable to arrive at based on the clinical\nstudies and frankly in discussion\nwith some doctors who prescribe\nfinasteride were the following: 0.5mg\nto one mg of finasteride as a tablet per\nday seems to be an effective and pretty\nsafe starting place for most people.\nNow some people will find that even\nthat 0.5mg dosage is just going to cause\nside effects that are not going to work\nfor them, and they're going to either have\nto reduce their dosage of finasteride or\nmove  to the topical or maybe cease\ntaking finasteride altogether.\nBut for many people out there,\nthat's going to be pretty well tolerated.\nThe key thing here is that one is going\nto have to wait some period of time\nto see whether or not\nany hair growth occurs.\nIt is a naive and frankly  foolish\napproach based on what we know about\nthe duration of that antigen phase\nof the hair to do one of these\ntreatments, wait a week or two\nand then decide to up your dose.\nNow, it is not foolish to reduce your dose\nif you're experiencing bad side effects,\nbut to simply increase your dose because\nyou're not getting results quickly enough,\nthat's not going to be  the best approach.\nI really encourage people who are going\nto explore the finasteride route,\nto think of this as a long-term project\nand to really ratchet up slowly if at all,\nstarting initially with a low dose taken\nfor a long period of time,\nmaybe even as long as  25 weeks before\nconsidering going up any further.\nCertainly, as I mentioned before,\nif you need to go down further,\nthat's not going to be a problem,\nat least not in terms  of reducing side\neffects, you're not going to get\nadditional hair growth,\nbut you're certainly not going to increase\nyour side effects if you reduce your dose.\nHowever, I will talk a little bit later\nabout post-finasteride syndrome,\nwhich is something that's getting\nincreasing attention nowadays.\nThat's something that occurs  after\npeople have taken finasteride\nfor an extended period of time.\nNow some of you have perhaps heard\nand I'll just tell you right here,\nthat the topical forms of finasteride are\nassociated with far less side effects.\nNow that might come as surprising given\nthat topical application of finasteride\ncan lead to systemic\ndistribution of finasteride.\nBut the numbers that are out there right\nnow, it's that topical finasteride  is\nassociated with 30-50% fewer side effects\nor 30-5 0% less severe side\neffects  than oral finasteride.\nThere are several things\nprobably responsible for that.\nOne is that people tend to ratchet up\ntheir dose of oral\nfinasteride  pretty quickly.\nBut keep in mind that the effective dose\nof finasteride in the blood is 0.2mg.\nEarlier I said the typical topical\nfinasteride solutions are 0.25%. People\nare taking one ml of it,\nthat equates to 2.5mg,\nand so it seems like a massive overdosing\nbut here's the discrepancy and here's\nwhere we can arrive at some\nreasonable recommendations.\nIf you decide that finasteride is\nright for you, you get a prescription.\nI would hope that you're monitoring your\nDHT levels and other hormone levels\nthat would be ideal,\nand working with a doctor, please.\n0.5mg to one mg per day of oral\nfinasteride seems to be\nthe best starting place.\nFor topical finasteride.\nIt's going to be that one ml of 0.25%\nthat we talked about earlier,\nbut that's taken only one time per week,\nand you can fully expect that right after\nthe application you will have higher\nlevels of finasteride in your bloodstream,\nand therefore lower levels of DHT\nand that will alter across the week.\nMost people are not going to be able\nto measure their DHT on a day\nby day or even weekly basis.\nIt's just too expensive\nand labor intensive.\nBut I think those dosing regimens ought\nto get people into more or less the same\ncategory of optimizing hair maintenance\nand hair growth while minimizing\nfinasteride side effects.\nOne point about finasteride  taken either\nalone or in combination is that in recent\nyears,  really in the last five or so\nyears, there's been increasing discussion\nabout so-called  post-\nfinasteride syndrome.\nNow post-finasteride syndrome is indeed\na new phenomenon in the sense\nthat finasteride  has been prescribed\nfor a very long period of time\nfor treatment of the prostate,\nat dosages of about five mg per day.\nThat's a very high dose.\nSometimes lower,  but as high as five mg\nper day, and for many years there was no\ndiscussion about this\npost-finasteride syndrome.\nWhat is post-finasteride syndrome?\nPost-finasteride syndrome is\nwhen typically it's males.\nThis is where it's been described.\nWe'll take finasteride at any range\nof dosages, from 1mg to 5mg per day.\nThey're either doing this for prostate or\nmore likely they're doing it to offset\nhair loss and increase hair growth,\nand then they stop taking finasteride\nfor whatever reason,\nfinancial or it wasn't working for them\nor the side effects  were not to their\nliking, and they start to experience  some\nvery severe what can only be called\nsyndrome effects,\nsuch as very reduced libido,\nvery reduced erectile function,\nvery reduced mood to the point\nof depression, even suicidal depression.\nThis is pretty scary stuff,\nespecially since it's occurring at an age\nwhen most of these things are\nnot typically occurring in males.\nThey can occur,  but they're not typical\nof younger males in their\n20s and 30s and early 40s.\nWe have to ask ourselves\nwhat's going on here?\nAfter all, people have taken  finasteride\nfor the prostate at fairly high dosages\nwithout this post-finasteride\nsyndrome when they've stopped.\nNow these young males are taking\nfinasteride,\nthey're coming off finasteride\nand they're getting this very severe, very\ndebilitating  post-finasteride syndrome.\nThis has become a hot topic,\nenough so that medical doctors who have\nbeen prescribing finasteride for a very\nlong  time, have been\nforced to address this.\nI think at first they were  perplexed\nand thought, I don't know, this might\nbe psychosomatic, whatever that means.\nAs a neuroscientist who works on mind-body\nconnection, we know that nothing\nis truly psychosomatic.\nEverything is of the mind and body.\nBut the point is that enough medical\nattention has been placed on post-\nfinasteride syndrome and trying\nto unravel  exactly what that is.\nWhere there are now a few general\nconclusions about what might be going on.\nFirst of all, it seems that younger males\ntaking finasteride in particular high\ndosages to improve hair growth or offset\nhair loss seems to be\none of the key variables.\nWe're not seeing this  post-finasteride\nsyndrome as much in older males.\nIn fact, it seems to occur more  in males\nin their 20s and 30s than\nmales in their 40s and older.\nOne thing and it may relate to the ways\nin which Dihydrotestosterone, we know,\nhas a very key role in early\nembryonic development.\nIt's actually what's responsible\nfor the male genitalia.\nIt's also responsible for certain things\nin female development,\nbut mainly in utero,\nit's responsible for male development and\ndevelopment of the penis in particular.\nThen around the time of puberty,\nDihydrotestosterone acts again,\nin what's called its activating effects\nto further increase growth\nof the genitalia, increase the musculature\nbone growth, et cetera, and increase\nlibido  and a number of other things.\nIt's probably also involved\nin the activation of puberty.\nIt's certainly not the only hormone\ninvolved in the activation of male\npuberty but it's certainly\none of the key players.\nDihydrotestosterone has these known early\nroles in embryonic development\nand in puberty, but what post-finasteride\nsyndrome seems to indicate is\nthat Dihydrotestosterone is likely having\nfurther effects  on male maturation,\nin particular,\nmaturation of the hypothalamus in areas\nof the brain that continue well\ninto one's 20s and maybe even one's 30s.\nHere I just want everyone to keep in mind\nthat we tend to think about development as\nchildhood, teenage years, young adulthood,\nadulthood, but really\ndevelopment never stops.\nDevelopment is something that starts\nat conception and birth, of course,\nand then extends all the way out\nuntil the point when we die,\nso even if we live to be in our late 90s\nor achieve 100 years of age,\ndevelopment is occurring that entire time,\nand these different hormones such as\nDihydrotestosterone are having different\nimpact for across the lifespan  and\nin different ways across the lifespan.\nThere isn't a clear conclusion about what\npost-finasteride syndrome is really all\nabout, but it points to the fact\nthat DHT is likely to be involved\nin development of the brain and the brain\nto genital axis,\nbecause I mentioned that because so many\nof the side effects\nthat are associated with this\npost-finasteride syndrome seem to center\non sexual side effects, although there\nare  also the depressive side effects.\nOf course, those can be related\nto one another in either direction.\nWhile I do understand that loss  of one's\nhair, or potential loss of one's hair can\nbe particularly troubling and anxiety-\nprovoking, even cause depression\nin some cases, I am sensitive to that.\nYou also want to be sensitive\nto the fact that some of these treatments,\nsuch as finasteride,\ncan carry very serious side effects even\nif you come off them AKA\npost-finasteride syndrome.\nAs long as we're talking about finasteride\nand this general pathway of 5α-Reductase\ninhibition and thereby DHT  inhibition\nand on and on topics and themes\nand nomenclature you are now very familiar\nwith, we have to talk about dutasteride.\nDutasteride is yet another molecule\nsimilar to finasteride,\nbut remember those three isoforms\nof the  5α-Reductase enzyme?\nWell, it inhibits all three,\nmainly type one and type two,  but also\ntype three, and it does it very potently.\nAs a consequence,\nthe typical dosage of oral d utasteride,\nget this, 0.5mg to 2.5mg taken orally,\nworks 2-5 times faster than typical\nfinasteride at inducing hair regrowth\nand reduces DHT by, get this, 95%.\nIt's just near flatlines DHT,\nand that can occur  at concentrations as\nlow as 0.5mg, although you will see\nprescriptions and people taking d\nutasteride anywhere from 0.5 mg\nall the way to 2.5mg orally.\nNow, not surprisingly,\ndutasteride is associated with a lot of\nside effects related to the DHT pathway.\nThings like reduction in sex drive,\nreduction in overall drive,\nit also tends to impact other hormone\npathways, so it increases\nin estrogen prolactin.\nThat's why gynecomastia,\ngrowth of male breast tissue  sometimes\noccurs when people take dutasteride and so\nyou're probably asking,\nwhy would anyone take dutasteride?\nWhy not just take finasteride\nand wait for that hair growth?\nWell,\nthe answer is that people are often very\nimpatient, and it turns out that d\nutasteride  works, about 2-5\ntimes faster than finasteride.\nSome people don't want to wait  a full 30\nweeks or 40 weeks or 50 weeks or more\nin order to grow their hair back,\nand they're very concerned about\nthe hair loss that's occurring.\nThey will take what I hope would\nbe a very low dose of dutasteride.\nI realize that there are ways\nto take dutasteride  that can be safer,\noff set some of these side effects.\nBut by my read of the literature,\nif one is going to try to mildly inhibit\nthe DHT pathway, things like saw palmetto,\nthings like topical caffeine,\nwhich has some effect  on the androgen\npathway, but as we talked about earlier,\ntickles other pathways,\nthings like ketoconazole,\nmild reduction in androgen receptor\npathways in the follicle and very direct\nbecause it's applied\ndirectly to the scalp.\nThings like that are going to be the best\nroute for mild reductions in DHT as\nan attempt  to maintain hair or grow hair.\nWhereas if one really wants a potent\nstimulus for increasing hair growth,\nthat's very likely  going to be\nfinasteride, and hopefully low enough\ndosages of finasteride and hopefully\na patient enough patient person that they\nare  willing to wait the duration of time\nrequired for that hair growth to come back\nbecause they understand that their\nantigen phase takes some time.\nNow the holy grail of all this hair stuff\nis in understanding that no one specific\ntreatment is magic, and in fact,\nthere are now a number of good meta-\nanalysis comparing  the various\ntreatments we've talked about\ntoday alone or in combination.\nWe can summarize that pretty easily\nby saying that combination treatments\nthat involve a mechanical stimulus\nand a chemical stimulus are always going\nto be better  than either one alone,\nand within the mechanical category,\nthe stimulus that seems\nto work best is microneedling.\nThe combination  of microneedling\nand finasteride, can lead to some pretty\nrobust  and impressive hair regrowth,\nso much so that people that were...\nI would only describe them as pretty bald\nor bald, can regrow\nsignificant amounts of hair.\nI've never seen examples of people\nwho were completely bald,\nmeaning lacking all scalp hair to grow\nback a full head of hair,\nbut the combination  of microneedling\nand finasteride is probably\nthe most effective way to go.\nIf you're going to do that,\nthere's no reason why you couldn't also\nuse ketoconazole shampoo,\ncould also use saw palmetto.\nThere's no reason to think that these\nthings collide with one another,\nalthough anytime you're inhibiting a DHT\npathway, or whether or not you're\nincreasing or decreasing any hormone\npathway for that matter,\nyou want to be careful about layering\nin too many different treatments because\nyou don't want your DHT\nlevel to go too low.\nLet's keep in mind that even if you take\na very low dose of finasteride and reduce\nyour DHT and don't have side effects,\nmaybe just the mere addition of\nsaw palmetto, which leads to a slight\nreduction in DHT combined with some\ncaffeine ointment,\nwould be sufficient enough to start\ninducing some of the  low\nDHT associated side effects.\nYou really have to see for you,\nand that's one of the major issues\nin this whole field  of hair growth\nand regrowth is  that people are highly\nindividual in their response,\nand in their side effect profile\nto these various treatments.\nThere's an enormous range there\nand unfortunately, there's no way to know\na priori before doing these treatments\nwhat your response is going\nto be in terms of side effects.\nYou're simply going to have to explore,\nand I would hope that you would explore\nstarting with minimal,\npossible effective dosages,\nand to do  that in coordination\nwith a medical professional so you could\nreally evaluate these things that the\nlevel of blood, and cosmetic changes.\nIn fact, that's a pretty good motivator\nfor thinking about the different\ntreatments that we talked about today.\nEverything from mechanical treatments,\nas simple as massage,\nwhich we've all heard about,\nbut for which there really aren't a lot\nof data for supporting hair growth.\nBut certainly things like microneedling,\nwhich is a mechanical stimulus\nfor which there are pretty good data\nthat it can improve hair growth.\nAlso things like saw palmetto,\na weak DHT antagonist.\nAlso things like ketoconazole shampoo,\nwhich again is a weak DHT antagonist\nand operates through some other pathways\nas well to stimulate hair growth.\nMy suggestion is that anyone  young, old,\nmale, female, who's thinking about\nembarking  on various treatments for\noffsetting hair loss and stimulating hair\ngrowth, consider both mechanical\napproaches, and the approaches that attack\nthe chemical pathways,\nthat can stimulate  hair growth, and can\ninhibit the inhibitors of hair growth.\nIn fact, that's the reason why we spend so\nmuch time on the biology of hair growth\nand what shuts down hair growth  early\non in today's episode,\nand then systematically went through each\nof the various treatments that relies\non and in some cases hinges entirely\non either a mechanical stimulus or\na chemical stimulus  in order\nto exert its effects.\nMy goal today was not to overwhelm you\nwith a ton of biology about hair,\nalthough we did cover a lot of biology\nof hair and stem cells and hair growth.\nMy goal in describing all that was really\nfor you to be able to hear about various\ntreatments, whether or not it's lasers or\nPRP or finasteride, dutasteride,\nor whatever is coming next  that we're\nsure to hear about soon online\nand from the medical community,\nand to be able to place those into bins\nrelated to their known or potential\nmechanisms and then to be able to step\nback and evaluate, which, if any, of those\ntreatments might be right for you.\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying\nthis podcast, please subscribe\nto our YouTube channel.\nThat's a
