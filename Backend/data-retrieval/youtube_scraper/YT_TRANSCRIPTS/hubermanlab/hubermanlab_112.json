    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr Alyssa eppel Dr eppel is a\nprofessor of Psychiatry and Behavioral\nSciences at the University of California\nSan Francisco she is also the director\nof the center on Aging metabolism and\nemotions Dr eppel's laboratory focuses\non stress and the many impacts that it\nhas on our brain and body both negative\nand positive for instance our laboratory\nhas shown that particular forms of\nstress change our telomeres which are a\ncomponent of the genetic Machinery of\nourselves that impacts how quickly our\ncells and therefore we age we also\ndiscuss exciting work from Dr Apple's\nlaboratory exploring how stress impacts\nour behavioral choices in particular\nwhich foods we elect to eat and how we\nexperience those Foods today you'll\nlearn how stress and your interpretation\nof your stress impacts the different\naspects of your biology and psychology\nyou'll also learn about several\nimportant stress interventions that Dr\nApple's laboratory has explored\nincluding Med meditation and breath work\ncan profoundly influence the way that\nstress impacts your brain and body both\nFor Better or For Worse she's also\nexplored how specific dietary\ninterventions such as omega-3 fatty acid\nintake impacts stress and our response\nto stress and a key and important\nfeature I believe of Dr Apple's work is\nhow stress and stress interventions vary\nin their effectiveness depending on\nwhether or not the subjects in her\nexperiments are male versus female and\ntheir social status by the end of\ntoday's episode I assure you you will\nhave a much more thorough understanding\nof what stress is and how it changes our\nbiology and psychology as well as the\nspecific stress interventions that are\ngoing to be most optimal for you in\nreducing the negative effects of stress\non the aging process and on negative\nbehavioral choices and also how to\nleverage stress in order to maximize the\npositive effects that stress can have on\ncellular metabolism mental health\nphysical health and performance to learn\nmore about the work from Dr eppel's\nlaboratory as well as to learn more\nabout her books entitled the telomere\neffect and now more recently the stress\nprescription you can find links to those\nin the show note captions before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nthesis thesis makes custom nootropics\nand frankly I'm not a fan of the word\nnootropics because it translates to\nSmart drugs and as a neurobiologist I\ncan tell you that our brain has neural\ncircuits and chemicals that underlie for\ninstance our ability to focus or to task\nswitch or to be creative there is no one\nspecific circuit or category of\nchemicals in the brain that allow us to\nbe smart thesis understands this and has\ndeveloped nootropics that are customized\nto different types of mental operations\nwhat do I mean by that well they have\nformulas that can put your brain into a\nstate of increased clarity or Focus or\ncreativity or that can give you more\noverall energy for things like physical\nexercise I often take the thesis Clarity\nformula prior to Long bouts of cognitive\nwork and I'll use their energy formula\nprior to doing any kind of really\nintense physical exercise if you'd like\nto try your own personalized nootropic\nstarter kit go online to takethesis.com\nhuberman you'll take a brief\nthree-minute quiz and thesis will send\nyou four different formulas to try in\nyour first month again that's\ntakethesis.com huberman and if you use\nthe code Huber minute checkout you'll\nget 10 off your order today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've talked many times before\non this podcast and on other podcasts\nabout the critical relationship between\nsleep and body temperature put simply in\norder to fall asleep and stay asleep\ndeeply throughout the night your body\nneeds to drop by about one to three\ndegrees in its core body temperature\nand conversely waking up involves one to\nthree degree increases in your core body\ntemperature so it's very important that\nyou control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment which also includes\nthe temperature of your mattress that's\nwhat eight Sleep mattress covers allow\nyou to do so for instance I tend to run\nhot during the night so I have my\nmattress set to be pretty cool at the\nbeginning of the night and then to get\nprogressively cooler and then warm\ntoward morning when I want to wake up\nand in doing this it's allowed me to\nreally optimize my sleep meaning I sleep\nmuch more deeply and I get far more\nrapid eye movement sleep than I ever did\nprior to using eight sleep if you'd like\nto try eight sleep you can go

today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by hvmn\nKetone IQ Ketone IQ is a supplement that\nincreases blood ketones I think most\npeople out there have heard of the\nketogenic diet however most people out\nthere including myself do not follow a\nketogenic diet despite not following a\nketogenic diet I make it a point to\nincrease my blood ketones through the\nuse of Ketone IQ the reason for that is\nthat ketones are one of the brain's\npreferred sources of fuel I find that by\ntaking Ketone IQ I have elevated levels\nof focus for several hours afterwards it\nalso allows me to do physical training\nor mental work fasted and in addition to\nthat I focus much better when I take\nKetone IQ as opposed to fasted alone so\nmany people like me find that whether or\nnot they follow a ketogenic diet or a\nmore typical diet supplementing with\nKetone IQ and thereby increasing their\nblood ketones allows them to do more\nfocused mental work and physical work\neven when fasted or when a bit

have\nyou here we have colleagues in common\nand topics of Interest related to our\nLaboratories in common so I've got a lot\nof questions today I'd love to just kick\noff by you explaining a little bit about\nthe different forms of stress you know\nwe hear stress stress is bad stress can\nkill us no one likes to feel stressed\nEtc but as you and I both know that's\nnot the entire picture so love for you\nto just educate us a bit on what stress\nis and what it isn't where it can be\nproblematic and where perhaps it can\neven be beneficial so as a stress\nscientist it is\na word I use a lot but it has to be\nbroken down because it has so many\ndifferent kind of dimensions and\nmeanings so there's good and bad stress\nthere's acute and chronic stress and you\nknow technically it just means anytime\nwe feel overwhelmed that we feel like\nthe demands are too much for our\nresources so that's kind of a very\ntechnical way to put it but really so\nmuch of life is about meeting challenges\nand we're never going to get rid of\ndifferent stressful situations in life\nif anything they are increasing and so\nit really comes down to\nnot the stressors of what happens to us\nbut really how we respond the stress\nresponse so that's a distinction that\nwe're still trying to get the field to\ntalk about stress in a more specific way\nso that we can think about well what\nsituations are in your life\nthey might be difficult ongoing\nsituations like caregiving or work\nstress or worrying about\nHealth your own or someone's\nand then there's how are you coping with\nit so when something happens we mount a\nstress response and we recover and\nbeautiful no harm done we need that\nthat's why we're here still alive is\nthat survival response it's it's a\nproblem these days of just we keep it\nalive in our head we keep it alive with\nour thoughts our thoughts are the most\ncommon form of stress\neven though I expected we would get into\ntools to combat stress a little bit\nlater\nsince you have now told us that our\nthoughts are the biggest sort of\npropagator of internal stress\nwhat to your knowledge is the best way\nor what are the best ways\nfor us to manage overthinking and\nruminating on stressful topics because I\ncertainly experience stress and when I\ndo I have tools related to you know\nbreath work running exercise sleep\nnon-sleep deep rest I'm a huge fan of\nall these sorts of things but when we\nsuccumb to stress and the thinking\npatterns take over\nwhere the gears are turning and they\nwon't stop turning what does the science\ntell us about ways to manage those\nthoughts should we work with them in the\nsense that we try and rationalize\num or understand the basis of the stress\nor should we try and divert our thinking\naway or is there some other tool that\nI'm aware unaware of yes yes both and\nright so I like to bin it in three\num three categories so one is we well\nI'll just say first of all we have to\nhave some awareness of how our mind\nworks or we're just like you know a\nsubject to thinking our thoughts are\nreal thinking that it's helpful to keep\nruminating and problem solving because\nthat's our tendency is to go toward\nwhatever we think there's threat or risk\nand to problem solve that but you could\njust be stuck there all day in this kind\nof threat mode or red mind State and\nthat's just a shame we don't need to\nturn on that that stress response all\nthe time\nit's where we are as a society so that's\nwhy I I wrote the stress prescription\ntake any survey even pre-pandemic and\npeople feel the majority of people feel\nan overwhelming amount of stress so even\nthis past year 46 of adults report\nfeeling overwhelmed by stress and then\nyou break it down you're like oh this is\nreally bad for young adults and women\nand people of color and so we have these\nyou know\ngroups that are targeted for\nmarginalization that are feeling\nan extremely high amount of stress in\nmost of those subgroups so bottom why\ndon't you argue that most most everyone\nis feeling more stressed now or is it\njust or what do the data say yeah so\nI think that\nwe come with different levels of\nawareness of our stress and so when I\nfind someone who really doesn't feel a\nlot of stress sometimes I can see right\nthrough that and they're just not aware\nand sometimes it really is true they\nthey're often in a different stage of\nlife and they control their environment\na lot and they've been through a lot I\nmean one of the\nbig patterns in the\npopulation levels of stress is that the\nolder people are less stressed period if\nyou're over 65 you have been through so\nmuch solved so much you just have a\nbetter perspective on life and on\nstressors and then our adults our young\nadults have like four times the level of\nstress as our older adults so so we do\nyou know we don't have to wait till we\nget older but there certainly is true\nwisdom and resilience that comes with\nage for many people\num often we're so used to feeling daily\nstress from our Urban and Modern Life\nthat we're we don't notice it we're just\nused to it and so we're going through\nthe day with kind of like clenched hands\nand just you know for listeners just\neven just taking a check in now and\nnoticing\nhow you might be holding stress in your\nbody that's a huge clue it's a huge\nplace where we accumulate tension so we\nmight not be aware that we're stressed\nbut we're crunching our hands and in\nfact\num\nmy taxi driver who drove me here\num\nlet me know that he's exactly that point\nthat he doesn't realize he's stressed\nuntil he realizes that he's tensing his\nshoulders and his fists and so great\nsignal you know doing a check-in to like\nnotice where in our body we're holding\nstress is step one to releasing it\nso um going back to this notion of\noverthinking what are the tools that\num are most efficient for\ndealing with overthinking or ruminating\nuh when people just can't seem to let go\nof the thing that's the stress or\nthinking about not the stress in their\nbody but the thing that caused the\nstress the difficult conversation the\nthing that irked them on social media or\nin their personal life or professional\nlife or simply out in the world\nso I I wish I had one answer but I'm\ngoing to say lots of strategies tackle\nthat and so in those three bins one are\ntop-down strategies of awareness and\nthings that we can say to ourselves\nsince our beliefs and mindsets can\nreally help us release stress view\nstress more positively the second bucket\nis\num not that the Mind changes the body\nbut the body changes the mind and those\nare the set of strategies that you tend\nto use the most right where where we're\nworking stress out of the body we're\nmetabolizing it we're burning it up and\nwe get relief changes are you know\namygdala activity and moves us to more\nan experiential state where we're more\nin our somatosensory cortex and then the\nthird bucket is change the scene just\ngetting away from\nall the stress triggers that we have in\nour office or in\num in the city and being an environment\nthat we find calming it might even be\njust be a corner of the house but\nimplanting what I call safety signals\nwhere just these animals that are\nconditioned to signals whether we're\naware of it or not so having having\nthings like comforting pets pictures\nsmells music\nwhy not we need those they help they add\nup yeah I like the idea of having a\nsmall physical space or I suppose it\ncould be a large physical space but for\nmost people who don't have the resources\nsome small pre-designated physical space\nthat represents a safe Zone\num and uh creating or I should say\npopulating that safe Zone with things as\nyou said\num as a visual neuroscientist originally\nI guess now I study stress um but uh as\na visual neuroscientist we know that\nphotographs are extremely powerful cues\nfor the memory system especially actual\nphysical photographs\num\nand I I believe there is some work on\nthis that if people keep a photograph of\nsomething that draws positive memories\nthat that photograph actually they keep\nit with them that actually can be a\npositive cue for alleviating stress and\njust enhancing mood\num this has probably done less so\nnowadays because everyone keeps things\non their phones and it's just kind of a\nscroll through but um in any event\nyou know when we talk about stress\nuh it's clear that there's short-term\nmedium-term long-term stress you've\nstudied all these different forms of\nstress\num if you would be so kind as to just\ngive us an overview of the different\nforms of stress uh how we can learn to\nrecognize those and then I'd love to\ntransition from there into talking about\nsome of the work that you've been doing\non stress and stress related eating and\nstress and how it relates to Aging in\nparticular but before we do that\num to get make sure everyone's on the\nsame page\num if you could just uh pepper our minds\nwith knowledge about stress and all its\num beautiful and not so beautiful forms\nso\nwhen we think about\nstress we usually think feeling stress\nyou know reporting stress and that's\nimportant what are bodies doing is also\nimportant it's not always related to our\nminds so measuring levels of the nervous\nsystem and how Vigilant we are is\nanother way that we can understand\nstress and that's particularly important\nand interesting because that's how\nstress gets under the skin and we might\nnot be aware we might not report stress\nbut we're still holding tension and\nbeing much more\nsympathetically dominated meaning that\nwe're our body is Vigilant and scanning\nfor cues and we don't feel safe and so\nwe're mobilizing a lot more energy than\nwe need to\nand stress is so expensive to the body\nthe stress response uses a tremendous\namount of energy ATP that's made by your\nmitochondria and if we have that kind of\nvigilant stress response on all day\nwe're just going to feel exhausted and\nwe all feel exhausted at this stage of\nthe kind of long shadow of the pandemic\nand it's really no mystery because we're\nnot good at turning the stress response\noff and that's what we want to really\nfocus on is understanding we need to\nmount a big stress response to cope with\nthings when we need extra energy but\nthen we can actually let our body\nrelax and we can turn it off and that's\nwhere the rumination comes and we want\nto catch ourselves rehearsing and\nreliving stress or worrying about the\nnext thing saying right now I'm safe and\nyou know there's the breathing\nstrategies I'm right with you where\nthose are the most direct and fast path\nto reducing stress in the body period\nyeah our colleague David Spiegel our\nassociate chair of Psychiatry at\nStanford and also a colleague of yours\num as well\num has I think said it best which is\nthat breathing is unique among the\nfunctions of the brain because it really\noriginates as a brain function and then\nextends of course to the body in that it\nrepresents a bridge between the\nconscious and the unconscious because at\nany given moment we're breathing\nand of course at any given moment we can\ntake control of our breathing there are\nvery few brain circuits that impact the\nbody in that way like I can't suddenly\njust change my rate of digestion because\nI decide to but we can do that with\nbreathing\nwe will definitely get into some of the\num work that you've been doing on breath\nwork particular I know you have a study\nthat's actually explored the Wim Hof\nmethod quite directly one of the few\nstudies I'm aware of that's done that so\nwe'll get to that a little bit later\num so you describe stress as a way that\nthe body and mind mobilize energy yeah\nand I didn't quite answer your question\nso there's there's that acute stress\nresponse when everything every hormone\nand cell in our body is having a stress\nresponse and that is allowing us to\nreorient focus problem solve it's really\nbeautiful how much we can increase our\ncapacity to do things during stress and\nthen if it you know lasts minutes or\nhours we eventually recover and\nthat is\num what happens all day in a small you\nknow to small extents with daily\nstressors we don't necessarily get so\nthreatened that we release a lot of\ncortisol but our nervous system is going\nup and down all day then there are then\nthere's kind of moderate stressful\nevents that maybe take days or months to\ncope with and what's important there is\nthat noticing like right now am I really\ncoping acutely with something or can I\nrestore so that kind of daily\nrestoration is very important and then\nthere are chronically stressful\nsituations that go on for years many of\nus not all of us but many of us have\nthose in our life These are situations\nI'll just use caregiving as an example\nof that we can't change we we can't\nchange other people we can't change\ncertain situations or resources and we\ncan\nbe thinking about them\nchronically problem solving trying to\nwish things were different\nor we can use acceptance radical\nacceptance strategies and other\nstrategies to live well with them and\nand so that's a really important\nstrategy for people who\nfeel like their their life is going to\nbe stressful forever because of X or Y\nthat that's not true you have a harder\nlife you're going to do more coping but\nyou can actually be dealing with\nuncontrollable chronic stress\nin ways that it's not going to take that\ntoll on your body I mean I study chronic\nstress and how it accelerates cell aging\nand I can tell you there's so much\nvariance between people people are so\ndifferent so among caregivers some of\nthem look as biologically young or\nyounger than our controls people with no\nidentifiable big tough situation in\ntheir life\nI'd love to hear about the um lack of\ninevitability around aging and stress I\nI realize that there's a big landscape\nof of discussion around aging and stress\nfor us to cover but since you brought it\nup in one of your papers there's a\nbeautiful graph and since a lot of\npeople are listening not watching and we\ndon't use visual diagrams for that\nreason\nI'll try and explain this as best I can\nyou distinguish between optimal aging\ntypical aging and accelerated aging I\nthink everyone\nI can imagine would want optimal aging\nright certainly not accelerated aging\nand what's interesting about this graph\nin your paper is that well of course it\nappears that toxic stress chronically\nunmitigated stress that makes us feel\nlike we are at the world's Mercy or the\nother people's Mercy will accelerate\naging\nturns out that under exposure to stress\nleads to more rapid aging than what you\ndescribe as ideal\namounts of stress in other words that no\nstress is not the answer\nrather to have some stress is ideal if\nyou want to have so-called optimal aging\ncan you explain a little bit about the\nmechanisms behind that maybe this is a\ngood opportunity also to tell us about\nyour telomere work\nso the questions are\nhow does one measure optimal versus\naccelerated aging and why would it be\nthat some stress is better than no\nstress when it comes to aging uh ideally\nso\nhaving no stress means we're not really\nliving like we're not engaging in the\ngifts of Life which are inevitably have\nsome Challenge and risk and let me give\nyou an example one study took um\nelderly people who retired and they you\nknow Society kind of labels them as\nyou're kind of done with your meaningful\nwork in life and\num your you know you are pretty much not\nable to contribute to society I mean\nthere's so many negative stereotypes\nthat people then kind of embody and then\nlive\num in this program brought them to work\nin schools and tutor young at-risk\nstudents and what happened to them is\nthey went from feeling maybe safe and\nunder stressed to feeling\nchallenged but generative they were\nfeeling more purpose they were feeling\nlike they were growing and they were\nfeeling like their day had more meaning\nthey had more relationships they had\nthese caring relationships with the\nstudents the students had all sorts of\nissues and troubles drugs and and maybe\nnot having lunch poverty and so they\nfelt the stress of that but they also\nsaw how much they could help with their\nsupport and their tutoring and in these\nstudy they they took images of the\nhippocampus and those who engaged in the\nprogram particularly the men actually\nhad growth of their hippocampus during\nthis program so at any stage in life we\ncan be growing and challenging ourselves\neven in our much later years and growing\nour brain and you know more than anyone\nlike what is that hippocampal growth\nmean for their well-being and their\ncognitive function\nyeah it's interesting that hippocampus\nof course a brain area involved in\nformation and recall of memories mostly\nformation of memories\num it's super interesting because it's\nso plastic it's so amenable to the\naddition of new memories I think the\nmost striking study to me is the one\nand I should point out that most of the\ndata say that the addition of new\nneurons is not the main reason for\nimprovements in memory but it is one of\nthem\num but Rusty gauged out the Salk\nInstitute did a study in the I think the\nearly 2000s where they took terminally\nill people and these people agreed to\nhave their bodies injected with a Dye\nthat would label new neurons and then\nafter they died their brains were\nprocessed\num and they didn't die from the dye\ninjection by the way folks they died\nfrom other causes they were terminally\nill and what they discovered was that\neven in terminally ill or or and some of\nthese people were quite old those people\nwere still generating new neurons\nespecially in the context of still\ntrying to learn and and acquire new\ninformation so wow um of course they're\ndead so they can't apply that\ninformation after that but of course\nnone of us can right none of the\ninformation but why not up to when you\ndie right absolutely yeah absolutely one\nother example of this my colleague Dave\nAlmeida he measures you know daily\nstressful events in huge National\npopulations and a small percentage of\npeople report no stressors and so you\nwonder like what's happening are they\nnot engaging in life are they really not\nhaving stressors it it looks like they\nare it's not just that they're not\ngetting stressed by things they're not\nthey're not really going out and doing\nmuch and what he found is that their\nlevel of kind of memory and cognition\ntheir cognitive Health was significantly\nlower so you can imagine the hippocampal\nyou know the lack of those\num neuroprogenerative cells they're just\nnot being stimulated it's super\ninteresting I wasn't aware of that\nresult so I appreciate you sharing it I\nalmost have to wonder if it's like\nexercise where you know so many people I\nthink now everybody hopefully\nunderstands that exercise is going to\nlower blood pressure reduce resting\nheart rate and proof musculoskeletal\nfunction and bone density all that stuff\nbut that if you took a snapshot of the\nbodily response during exercise\nblood pressure is way way up heart rate\nis way way up\nstress hormones are way up cortisol is\nthrough the roof during a hard workout\nimmediately afterwards and yet that sets\nin motion a series of adaptations that\nbrings you to a better place most of the\ntime I almost wonder if stress is the\nsame\nis there any evidence that\nshort bouts of stress provided that\nthey're managed well meaning that we\ndon't spend the next 24 or 48 Hours\nruminating on the stressor but that\nwe're able to move through the stressor\nand resolve it in some way that that's\nactually beneficial for us because of\nthe mobilization of energy stores and\nmaybe\nmaybe even changing our threshold for\nreacting to stressors in the future\nit's a great question and it's one that\nI have been chewing on for a while\nbecause we we know as you said that\nphysical stressors when they're short\nand repeated like high intensity\ninterval training They are promoting not\njust aerobic fitness but stress Fitness\npeople feel less rumination less\ndepression less anxiety so they're kind\nof tuning up the nervous system what\nabout psychological stressors and we we\nknow two things so one is I do think\nthat there is a level of Engagement with\nmoderate stressors that when we are used\nto them we get fit and our stress\nresilience builds meaning we're less\nthreatened by them so let me go deep\ninto that we can two people can approach\nthe exact same stressor and one person\nis having a pretty overreactive stress\nresponse where they basically are\nfeeling their survival is threatened so\nit's high cortisol High vasoconstriction\nand blood pressure goes up equally in\nboth but the person who's feeling super\nthreatened either their survival or\ntheir social survival of their ego their\nblood pressure went up because of the\nvasoconstriction the other person who's\nviewing the same stressor as\nI can do this this is a great Challenge\nand opportunity I have what it takes\nthose types of thoughts generate a\ndifferent hemodynamic response which is\nactually more cardiac output so blood\npressure is going up but in this\nhealthier way more oxygenation to the\nbrain better problem solving they're\nable to maintain this positive outlook\nso we've measured the threat challenge\nresponse in many lab studies and we know\nlots of things so if you're having more\nof the challenge response at the end of\nit you're less inflamed so just in the\nlab within an hour or two we see that\nthere they didn't trigger all that\npro-inflammatory response and their\ntelomeres tend to be longer which is a\nmeasure we can talk more about but\nbasically it looks like they have a\nslower\nspeed of Aging\nthat is super interesting you call this\na stress challenge response so we could\ncall this kind of a\num\nto to be really simplistic two types of\npsychological stress response feeling\nthreatened like you're gonna fail you're\nembarrassed\num you know that social pain response we\nknow well that feels terrible\num but that also that huge stress\nresponse when we you know we feel it in\nour stomach our heart is pounding it's\njust an over exaggerated response that\nresponse biologically is different and\nthe thoughts that go with it are\ndifferent and we recover a lot slower\nand then there's the challenge response\nwhich is this it's more of that kind of\nactivated\num excited response and the beauty is\nthat there are lots of studies out there\ndone by emotions and social\npsychologists that tilt people toward\nthe challenge response we can actually\npromote that challenge response and so\nwhen you asked about like is it good to\nhave a repeated stress response\nyes if it's if it's manageable right\nthen we're kind of building the muscle\nof stress resilience\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health and those\nprobiotics and athletic greens are\noptimal and vital for microbiotic health\nin addition athletic greens contains a\nnumber of adaptogens vitamins and\nminerals that make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs are met\nand it tastes great if you'd like to try\nathletic greens you can go

I can do in order including me I\nshould say\num can do in order to wage that\nchallenge response is this purely based\non mindset like instead of saying why me\nwhy this why now I can't believe this is\nhappening is it a mental pivot to okay\nthis is a great opportunity for growth\nI don't know how I'm going to manage\nthis but I'll manage this\num you know you want to stop me you got\nto kill me type of type of mindset is\nthat is that the switch that then the\nbody follows because this is an\ninteresting instance where\nthe uh most all the\nstress mitigation work that my lab does\nis focused on using the body to control\nthe mind but here we're talking about\nthe Mind controlling the body first and\nthen the body following suit which I\nfind equally fascinating so are there\nsome specific mental scripts that people\nfollow and are we all able to follow\nthose those scripts yes to some extent\nwe control the script we can use that\nscript to prepare ourselves going into a\nstressful situation and we can use it at\nany point during the stress or so some\nof us are just wired to have a big\nthreat response period maybe it's you\nknow it's uh epigenetics We've inherited\nmaybe it's early trauma that has shaped\nus to be ex have this exaggerated\nemotional response and yes we and others\nhave found that trauma sensitizes our\nemotional stress response so that we are\nfeeling more threatened but that's okay\nbecause that's the part we can't control\nand we just have to have a lot of\nself-compassion and awareness that okay\nthe this is what I do my body reacts\nlike this but what happens next that's\nwhen we can start to use those\nstatements self-comforting\nself-compassion distancing there's all\nsorts of statements that allow us to\nthen recover more quickly\nso when we want to shift from a\nthreatened response to a kind of\nchallenge response\nare there any data that dictate whether\nor not we should\nkeep those statements in our head write\nthem down say them out loud I guess what\nI'm trying to do here is trying to get\nto a little bit more of the the meat of\nthe the actionable so since a lot of our\nlisteners so I think we'll be\num as I am very excited about the idea\nthat a mere shift in our mentality about\nstress can give us the opposite outcome\nI mean before you're talking about\nvasoconstriction and inflammation and\nall these bad things\nto um put it lightly and then\nin the challenge response to stress\ngetting the exact opposite more\nvasodilation more resources used and\nmore positive effects on the brain and\nbody yeah so what what are some um if if\nyou can recall from the papers if not\nthat's fine but I'm just curious what\nwhat those specific tools might be every\nstatement you said Andrew is good it's a\ngood one the whole trick here is that\npeople need to find the the strength\nstatements the stress Shields I call\nthem that fit them that that feels right\nand that they believe and so they're you\nknow I list a bunch of options in\nchapter three which is called be the\nlion instead of the gazelle so the Blind\nand gazelle are both you know high blood\npressure high stress and the Lion's\nchasing the gazelle but the gazelles\nhaving this total threat\nvasoconstriction response because\num she might die lion might get dinner\nright so it's needing to mount the\nstress response because it's so excited\nto get the tasty dinner for you know the\nnext few days and so the lion is having\nthat challenge response and so we can\nremind ourselves be the lion we it's\nit's not that we're always lying or\ngazelle we get to shape that and so some\nof those statements are well let's say\nright when when we're going into it list\nyour resources why have you ever dealt\nwith any situation like this remind\nyourself of past successes remind\nyourself of someone you can call or text\nor feel supported by remind yourself\nthat this outcome is not going to affect\nyour life in 10 years or five years\nthat's a distancing kind of um\nperspective taking so there's all these\nstrategies and and you got to use what\nworks for you telling yourself I got\nthis I can do it I can get through it I\nhave what it takes those are all good\nShields and another set is you know\nwe've some of us feel really stressed\nout by stress like once we get feel our\nheart racing that leads to oh no you\nknow this is bad for me and so rather\nthan than getting stressed by stress we\nactually want to remind ourselves that\nthis stress response is empowering this\nis going to help me cope\nmy body's excited my body is doing just\nwhat it should right now\nso that reframing in Studies by Wendy\nMendez and others my my colleagues who\ndo these reappraisal research they have\nbasically trained people to view stress\nas positive during the stressful\nsituations in the lab people do better\nthey perform better they feel more\npositive emotion they problem solve\nbetter they recover more quickly so\npretty powerful stuff\nyeah that is powerful stuff I'm\nwondering if we can talk about the\nrelationship between stress and eating\nand I think that's also a great\nopportunity for us to talk about the\nopioid system a lot of people are\nfamiliar with the so-called um opioid\nepidemic and opioid crisis\num you know sadly you know\nfar too many people are dying a fentanyl\noverdoses and we all know about the oxy\ncontent epidemic and all these people\naddicted to opioids and\nthat's not really what this is about\num what we're about to talk about is the\nfact that we have an opioid system\nwithin us that is neurons and other cell\ntypes that can reduce excuse me can\nrelease substances into our brain and\nbody that make us feel less pain and\nmake us feel sedated but at a healthy\nlevel right and yet there are a lot of\nthings besides drugs that can activate\nthis opioid system\num I think sexo activates the endogenous\nopioid system as far as a last read\nthere was a paper out recently but also\nfood can do it\num and again to healthy levels um\nprovided the context is healthy of\ncourse what is the relationship between\nstress and eating\nand eating and the opioid system\nstress and eating is an interesting one\nso most people when they feel stressed\nor you know I'm just gonna ask you do\nyou eat more or less when you're\nstressed less definitely I feel like I\ncan go two three days without food when\nI'm when I'm really stressed but I came\nup in a profession where\num sadly for me all-nighters were\npart of the regular until pretty\nrecently a couple years ago when I just\ncalled an end to that\num and no it wasn't just because of\nprocrastination it was just work\noverload but I can go a long period of\ntime without eating although I love to\neat so I do point out that I do love to\neat and what does the body feel like\nwhen you're in that stress State when\nyou're not even hungry you're kind of\nshut down in your digestion that I have\nenough energy from my neural resources\nfrom adrenaline and\ngenerally those periods of time when I'm\nnot hungry coincide with a hyper focus\non the stressor the deadline whatever it\nis in life that that needs tending too\nand um food just doesn't appeal to me as\nmuch it doesn't taste as good and it's\nnot as enticing yeah so we think that\neither type of\num body temperament is high sympathetic\nand so when you have a big stress\nresponse your digestion is is pretty\nmuch shut down like it would be the\nopposite eating would be the opposite of\nwhat your body's telling you to do I\nshould I'm just gonna forgive me for\ninterrupting uh for those of you hearing\nsympathetic we're we're not talking\nabout sympathy we're talking about the\nuh the sympathetic arm of the autonomic\nnervous system which is the so-called\nfight or flight as opposed to the\nparasympathetic in any event sorry to\ninterrupt but want to make sure that\num sometimes people hear sympathy and\nthen they think emotional sympathy\num I like to think I have that too but\num okay so I so I tend to lean more\ntowards the sympathetic meaning\num more alertness arousal yeah on the\nSeesaw of the autonomic nervous system\nand I I'm a High\num sympathetic reactor I lose weight\nwhen I go through like writing my\ndissertation I look like a skeleton at\nthe end\num but that's not what most people\ncomplain about it's not weight loss most\npeople complain about overeating or\nbinge eating when they're emotional when\nthey're stressed and so that's the more\ncommon pattern and what that that looks\ndifferent\nboth in the brain and biologically and\nso what it looks like is that the stress\nresponse is driving cravings and also\nlet's say high insulin or an insulin\nresistant State and what goes along with\nthat is tending to be overweight or have\nobesity and so just by whether it's\nthrough conditioning or genetics having\nthat kind of larger body with a big\nstress eating temperament that is a\nchallenge in life and I've been you know\nI've worked with people with different\neating conditions Eating Disorders binge\neating and it is\na um what's hard about it is number one\nit's very common and normative to just\nfeel like\nyou can't feel satiated so it's this\ncompulsive eating tendency that stress\nbrings you to and\nso the so what it mean we measure this\nis very easy to measure it means that\npeople feel like they can't control\ntheir eating they don't get full\num they think about food a lot and so\nstress kind of exacerbates that tendency\nand that is a you know it's a it's a\ncommon phenotype like we've studied it\nand maybe 50 of people with obesity have\nthat\num do lean people have that some not\nmany like less than 20 percent but what\nthey also have is this tremendous kind\nof uh diet what we call dietary friend\nor control over their eating so they're\nthey're able to\nto not overeat even though they're\nthinking about food a lot\nso that's that is you know that explains\nthat unusual\nbody of someone who's really more\num still has those compulsive traits so\nwhy does this matter this makes it\nreally hard to eat well because when\nyou're stressed you Dr you're craving\nthe comfort food the high fat high sugar\nhigh salt\ndepending on your temperament and that\nis\nthat means with repeated bouts of stress\nyou're just going to be gaining weight\nand particularly in the intra-abdominal\narea that's what we've seen we've seen\nit cross-sectionally we've seen it in\nrest studies in my studies and now we've\nseen it in people and many stuff for\nabout 10 years I study this and the\nquestion was is what's happening in\npeople the same thing that's happening\nin mice if you stress them out and you\ngive them Oreos the mice develop binge\neating they get really compulsive and\nthey get this you know terrible\nmetabolic Health profile metabolic\nsyndrome where they're they're round you\nknow they're in their belly fat\nbasically expands like a cushion and\nthat's because that's this really good\nimmediate source of energy during stress\nso like we're really well wired to if\nour body thinks we're under chronic\nstress we're going to store stress fat\nor abdominal fat so we can just mobilize\nthat in a second and then the second\nquestion we've asked is can you reverse\nthat with different interventions can\nyou can you block the compulsive eating\num so I can I can tell you what we found\nthere but the opioid system that you\nmentioned is certainly involved and in\nstudies with people lean people and\npeople with obesity my colleague rajita\nSinha Yale it's basically found that\nwhen you stress them out people with\nobesity are having a different reward\nresponse and they're having their the\nmore insulin resistant they are the more\ntheir Reward Center lights up during\nstress and what's causal there like\nwhat's the chicken what's the egg sir\nbecause I can imagine these were people\nthat at one time were not obese who got\nstressed\nthe opioid system\nreacted in a particularly potent way to\nfood and they were able to clamp their\nstress and so then they become or binge\neaters in the context of stress yeah and\nthat leads to insulin insensitivity\nexactly I could also imagine that they\nwere insulin insensitive therefore they\nneed to eat more in order to feel come\nof an increase in uh\nsatiety because we know this\num now based on brain and body\nmechanisms and then that set off a\nCascade of things leading to obesity\num not that it necessarily matters but\nwhat's causal do we know I think it\nreally does matter I think there's been\na you know a mistake of kind of\nconfounding all obesity with food\naddiction and\num and metabolic disease and it's\ncompletely heterogeneous so I I think\nit's the developmental path that you're\ndescribing which is that\num there's a tendency toward having a\nbigger reward response and hunger during\nstress so it becomes a way of coping a\nlifestyle and and that is a pathway\ntoward obesity and so some obese people\nhave a dysregulated stress response\nbut I but not all of them I mean it\nreally is a certain type of person so\nthat's why we target people with\nCravings in all of our intervention\nstudies now we want to know who has more\nof the compulsive eating type because\nthey need a different set of skills to\ncope with stress and to lose weight if\nthat's their goal\nthere's a drug I'm sure you're familiar\nwith Naltrexone which it can block the\nopioid receptor it's used to block the\nopiated receptor in the context of\ndifferent types of addiction have people\ntried to use Naltrexone in the context\nof binge eating and does it help people\nlose weight because\nit presumably reduces some of the\nrewarding properties of food\nthat's one of the very few drug\ncombinations that has been used for\nbinge eating so it was a combination of\nNaltrexone and Wellbutrin and I'm not\nsure at this moment how much\num that's favored for binge eating but\ncertainly the early trials showed that\nit really does damp down on the\ncompulsive eating interesting so is that\na commonly prescribed uh kit of drugs\nnow for for obesity I know there's a lot\nof excitement nowadays about these\nsemi-glue tied yeah\num uh analogs because they do seem very\neffective in blocking hunger especially\nin type 2 diabetics I don't know if\nyou're familiar with but right they're\nsort of all the rage uh mostly because\npeople saw the before and after photos\nof Elon he had his shirt off on a boat\nand there were some not so nice comments\nmade about him and then sometime later\nhe was quite a bit lighter and um he\nannounced that he had been taking one of\nthese semi-glue tied agonists yeah yeah\nI really hope that we come up with\num safe and effective drugs and one\nthing to think about is that the the\nchallenge that we all have particularly\nfor prone to obesity is the toxic food\nenvironment and particularly the refined\nsugar and regardless of what we're on\nMetformin or one of these drugs we\noverride it with our diet and and really\nthe improved nutrition is the only way\nto solve it as a public health problem I\nmean the drug companies are saying\neveryone should be you know everyone\nwith a certain I should be on one of\nthese new drugs and it's just rubbish\nand it's not going to lead to long-term\nhealth\nwell I know you have a colleague there\nat UCSF um Dr Robert lustig who's been\ntalking about sugars and hidden sugars\nfor years and the problems with that and\nand we don't want to demonize sugar as\nthe only cause of the Obesity epidemic\nbut it's certainly one of them at least\nthat's my belief according to the data\nyes and Rob is the biggest proponent of\nyou know of helping people understand\nthe big problem and the root is in the\nprocessed food and the sugar and that\nthe drugs don't touch that we just we\noverride effects of any drugs with our\ndiet and and so it's\num It's been a\na losing battle really because of the\nforce of big food and big Pharma\nso let me go back to the the compulsive\neating so we've we've we've um there are\nsome clues about how to break that cycle\nso one is in our weight loss trials or\nour healthy mindful eating trials we\nfind that\nmindful eating is not going to cause a\nlot of weight loss period but the people\nwho benefit most from learning this kind\nof calm self-regulation where you check\nin with your hunger you slow down you\nincrease your awareness of your body so\nin terreceptive awareness\nthat\num type of\nskill is really critical for people with\ncompulsive eating and so in our trials\nwe find that if they people with\ncompulsive eating if they get that if\nthey get randomized to the mindful\neating they do better in terms of their\ninsulin resistance and their glucose and\ntheir long-term weight loss so that's\none good clue another is\nthe positive stress pathway looks\nimportant for breaking the compulsive\neating cycle so high intensity to\ninterval training or you know maybe some\nof these other ways that we've been been\ntalking about to increase the bodily\nstress in these short-term ways to\nmetabolize stress in our body can help\nwith the cravings\nso what would that look like in the\ncontext of let's say somebody\num has the opposite phenotype to me they\nget stressed and they find themselves\nreaching for snack food or that they\nsimply can't reach satiety they just\nwant to eat and eat and eat\num what are some of the aside from\nNaltrexone and Wellbutrin and some of\nthese prescription approaches because I\nalways say while I value certainly value\nprescription drugs in certain contexts I\nalways feel like behaviors should come\nfirst do's and don'ts\nthan nutrition then supplementation and\nthen if and only if it's still needed\nprescription drugs but that's just my\nbias based on my observations\nI like to think so uh it also is a uh it\nstarts at a zero cost um Endeavor I mean\nbehaviors require time but it certainly\num includes everybody not just those\nthat have insurance or that live in a\nparticular region of the US or the world\nso anyway\num that's my bias and at least for the\ntime being I'm sticking with it\num it's the basis of a lot of what we\ntalk about on this podcast but\nnonetheless if somebody is uh finding\nthemselves in that category of binge\neating or heading towards binge eating\nor using food to comfort or alleviate\nstress\nhow should they intervene in their own\nthoughts and behavior we talked about\nthe the bins top down strategies\nchanging the body changing the scene we\nneed all of those I mean the the\ncompulsive drive to eat is one of our\nyou know strongest impulses if we've\ndeveloped that pathway and so the we\ntrain people for example in mindful\nawareness of separating out emotions\nfrom Hunger so they get really wrapped\nup together so just labeling how you're\nfeeling labeling your hunger from one to\nten and figuring out is it am I really\nhungrier as a boredom that helps people\nand if you do that check-in right before\nyou eat that helps the most so that's\nthe top-down mindful check-in the uh\nother thing we help people do is like\nright the craving surf the herbs so if\nwe deal a lot with soda Drinkers and it\nis addictive and there is nothing worse\nthan drinking sugar soda for our body so\nwe help people by help um having them\nwatch their craving pass and and knowing\nthat it's a matter of time that they can\nsurf the urge without jumping to\nconsuming and so that practice helps\nsome people especially with practice\nthe push-ups the taking a walk the\nchanging the scene getting away from\nfood is always going to be a huge strong\nstrategy if you can get yourself away\nfrom it the the problem is as you know\nis that the Cravings get you to the\nbuffet they drive you to the the soda\nEtc and so just you know creating safe\nenvironments both at home and in the\nworkplace where you don't have soda is\nreally important so we try that at UCSF\nmy colleagues and I um including Rob\nlustig the anti-sugar doctor we just saw\nthe absurdity of being a medical center\npeople come with these chronic diseases\nand what are they served in the\ncafeteria or even at their bedside\nsugared Coke in the hospital in the\nhospital and so my colleague Laura\nSchmidt who's uh partly responsible for\nthe soda tax she rallied the all the\num we went top down to Administration\nbut bottom up to vendors got rid of all\nthe soda in all of our hospitals and\ncampuses and we found two things number\none\npeople who were heavy drinkers\nlost weight in the most important Place\ntheir waste heavy soda drinkers so when\nwe took it out of the workplace\nthey actually had their health improved\nand number two those with compulsive\neating they score high on our our little\nscale for\num reward based Drive\nit didn't help them\nso then we randomized half of them to\nget some extra boost we call it\nmotivational interviewing where we're\nreally supporting them more and helping\nthem you know think of goals like being\nwith their grandchildren not getting\ndiabetes and in that little bit of\nsupport helped them tremendously and so\nnow we're trying to roll that out in you\nknow a big controlled trial but at least\n100 hospitals have adopted the\num stop selling sugary drinks because\npeople don't want to be sick but they\ncan't help it if they have the reward\ndrive and if they have the compulsivity\nand it's right there at work we're just\nworking against health\nsuper interesting I think that um\nfor most of us we think about sodas the\nkind of thing that maybe we have every\nonce in a while or that we drank more\nwhen we were kids I seem to have lost my\nappetite for soda at some point you just\nknow too much teen years maybe or just\nat some point I I started to feel like\nthere were better Alternatives\num and you know like what well okay well\npeople want ideas yeah well full\nconfession I mean okay most of my\nnon-water uh beverage consumption is\ngoing to be either coffee\num usually black coffee or nowadays I\nsometimes will throw some ketones in\nthere not because I'm on a ketogenic\ndiet but for I do feel like it makes my\nuh level of focus and cognition better\npouring in this morning yeah I do use it\nbefore podcasts and we're prepping for\npodcasts it\num there are good data showing that uh\nwe can all utilize ketones as a as a\nbrain fuel even if we're not on a\nketogenic diet that's um clear to me\nbased on my experience and the data as I\nsee them and understand them\num or yerba mate tea which is just a\ncaffeinated tea from South America which\nI like very much\num\nhowever I am guilty of drinking the\noccasional diet soda every once in a\nwhile and I know that you know some of\nmy audience will just gasp how could I\ndo that but we're talking about the\noccasional diet soda the occasional Diet\nCoke mostly because I I don't like the\ntaste of sugary soda and I actually\nreally like the taste of diet soda\nAspartame is a particularly rewarding\ntaste for me\num and as a consequence I try and avoid\ndrinking it more than I might have a can\nof Diet Coke once a month maximum\nusually on a plane or something like\nthat so that's the extent of it but if I\nhave the choice between a really great\ncoffee and a soda it's going to be\ncoffee or yerba mate soda it's gonna be\nyerba mate\num or food and soda I'm gonna eat\ninstead and so that's me but I do recall\nyou know as a teenager soda was kind of\na default you just kind of like go to\nthe soda fountain and fill the drink it\nfelt like such a rewarding thing\num and I think the reason we're drilling\ninto this more deeply is it sounds to me\nbased on what you said earlier in my\nread of the literature also brings me\nthe idea that that\ndrinking sugar in the form of liquid is\none of the worst things that we can do\nin terms of our bodily regulation of\ninsulin and glucose\num it's I don't want to use the words\nempty calories because that's kind of a\nloaded phrase but it is essentially\nempty calories it doesn't work it's\nharmful calories they're not empty yeah\nI mean there are no amino acids in there\nthey're no essential fatty acids and\nthere aren't many carbohydrates that you\ncan really utilize for\num long-term bouts of mental or physical\nwork so so what do you view soda as one\nof the um the worst certainly not the\nbest but one of the worst culprits out\nthere I mean it is really prominent\nespecially nowadays also we should\ninclude energy drinks a lot of kids\nespecially males by the way it's it's\nalmost this is crazy it's almost 95 of\nenergy drink consumption is males\ninteresting and I don't know what what\nis maybe it's the packaging or who how\nthe marketing has been pitched but by\nthe way as soon as I say that someone\nwill be in the YouTube comments telling\nme that that's completely false but we\ncan point you the data um so what are\nyour thoughts on sugary drinks and what\nthat's doing\num\nhow it do you think this is a reaction\nto how much stress people people are\nexperiencing is this like people's\nattempt to to inoculate their stress or\nis it simply that it tastes good and\nit's easy to consume and it's relatively\ninexpensive people have not and we have\nnot really studied the sugary drinks in\nthe same way we have studied the comfort\nfood and the binge eating and so\num my guess is that it is part of a\nstress response but even more than that\nit's part of the hedonic cycle so when\nyou get the sugar\nespecially if it's packed with caffeine\nthat's going to be a more addictive\ndrink you get this you know really feel\ngood response right away and then you\nget the low and it's the hedonic\nwithdrawal so which is this you actually\nfeel bad when it's been a while since\nyou've had it and so then it drives the\ncompulsivity you want it again because\nyou wanna not because you want to feel\nbetter you want to get rid of feeling\nbad so that's what happens with both\nfood addiction and we think that happens\nwith sugary drinks now let me tell you\nthat\nwhen you asked is is a sugary drink one\nof the worst things we can do for our\nhealth yes because sugary food\ndoesn't go to our brain as quickly as a\nliquid liquid sugar a sugary drink so\nthink about cocaine and crap crack goes\nto the brain immediately and it's that\nmuch more addictive that's how we think\nof liquid sugar\nThe View on sugar I I think is starting\nto change and I think in the years to\ncome provided folks like you and Dr\nlustig continue to uh be vocal about it\nwhich I hope you will\num I think it's going to shift things\nquite a bit I look at it a little bit\nlike trans fats you know I was growing\nup people ate margarine and now like\ntrans fats are banned in many cities\num it's kind of incredible how these\nthings have have changed\num over time and it requires an effort\nnot just on social media but podcasts\nand I think also lobbying\nuh lobbying our politicians really\ngetting them to understand\num just how pernicious this stuff is\nthere's a lot of social norms that go\ninto like what's good for for all of us\nas a as a group or community and what's\npersonal choice it's very fiery you know\nI just I've heard a colleague talking\nabout how bringing junk food or soda to\nwork is like passive smoking you're like\nyou're bringing something and that's\ngoing to pollute other people's health\nand you shouldn't do it so that's that's\nmuch more Edge energy and people will\nfight them on that\num but the the basic reality is yeah\nwe're gonna eat the donuts if they're in\nfront of us and so in it is much more\nconsiderate to bring a bowl of fruit\nI'm glad you brought up smoking I don't\nwant to take us off topic but as long as\nwe're venturing into these general or I\nshould say more General and yet really\nimportant themes around public health\nand food yes I learned something\ninteresting about smoking and why so few\npeople now smoke\num I always thought that the campaigns\naround smoking and how terrible it is\nfor us showing pictures of lungs that\nare you know caked with all this tar and\nlike you you know cancer and all this\nstuff was the effective message but what\nI learned was that one of the most\neffective messaging systems in the the\nbattle against smoking was to get young\npeople to stop smoking not by telling\nthem it was bad for them but by showing\nthem videos of these um\nrich men sitting around tables cackling\nabout the fact that they're making so\nmuch money on the health problems of\nother people because of smoking in other\nwords what they did is they made being a\nnon-smoker anti-establishment and so I\nfind it very interesting anytime there's\nsomething like soda or highly processed\nfoods that are so woven into the\nestablishment it seems like though you\ncan we can tell people until you know\nwe're blue in the face about all the\nhealth concerns with with these things\nyou know sugar is bad and this is bad\nhighly processed food is bad some people\nmight change their behavior but seems\nlike for the younger generation the\nthing that's most effective is to\nactivate their sense of rebellion this\nhas been true for probably hundreds of\nthousands of years but it's certainly\ntrue in the last hundred years\nand let them see that there is a very\nstrong\num big food sometimes big Pharma but\ncertainly big food system that is\nworking against them and that it in\norder to take control of their health\nactually we want to activate their sense\nof rebellion so that they're like no I'm\ngoing to take excellent care of myself\nI'm not going to fall victim to this\nmonetary scheme and here I'm not\npointing to any conspiracy I mean this\nhas been seen with smoking this has been\nseen with a number of different\nPharmaceuticals again not all\nPharmaceuticals are bad this is true of\na number of different aspects of of kind\nof a big markets absolutely it's like\npull the blinders off let people know\nthat we're vulnerable to all the\nmarketing and that there's there really\nare suppression of data behind a lot of\nit so it had it's happening with\num with eating disorders too Eric Stice\nwho's at Stanford with you has been\nusing this method we call it dissonance\nshowing people with eating disorders how\nthe food industry has been manipulative\nand has tried to\ndesign foods for addiction for the\nhighest bang for the buck with dopamine\nEtc and so that has helped reduce eating\ndisorders in these studies and it has\neven helped reduce reward drive that\nisn't that amazing that the dissonance\ncould do that so interesting yeah I\nthink uh what it's telling us is that um\nfew things are as strong as the\num no I won't I refuse to response in\nterms of changing behavior\num especially when there's something to\npush against so it's not just a battle\nwith ourselves I want the soda but I'm\nnot going to drink it it becomes a well\nI want it but I want it because you are\nmaking me think I want it I don't\nactually want that so um I don't know\nmaybe this is getting me back into my\nteenage mindset but I think a sense of\nrebellion provided it's in the direction\nof Health one's own health and the\nhealth of others of course\num can be a positive thing yeah so we do\nthat with the mindful eating we really\nwe have them bring in the junkiest\nprocessed food they can think of like a\nTwinkie and eat that really slowly and\nmindfully and few people finish it and\nthey're like that actually wasn't nearly\nas good as the picture of it and the\nidea of it and so it's like that reward\npredictive error that you've talked\nabout where they they think the brain is\ndriving them to have it because of the\nad advertising and their expectation\nthat they'll feel good but if they're\nreally paying attention it's that it's a\nvery disappointing experience versus we\nalso have people Savor a piece of good\nchocolate whichever they like milk or\ndark and that experience teaches them to\neat slowly and really enjoy small\namounts of rewarding food so that\nthey're not they don't need to feel full\nand binge oh so interesting\num\ndarker milk chocolate dark yeah\nI actually like the 100 chocolate\nthere's one brand of Venezuelan\nchocolate that's 100 which sound it\nmight sound awful but it's actually\nquite good I think that was the first\ntime I could actually taste the the real\nelements of chocolate interesting yeah\nthat is not rewarding it's way too\nbitter for me I need the mouth feel you\nknow give me some fat in it oh my well\nyeah it's hard to find but um it's out\nthere I'd like to just take a brief\nmoment and thank one of our podcast\nsponsors which is inside tracker inside\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that blood\nwork is the only way that you can\nmonitor the markers such as hormone\nmarkers lipids metabolic factors Etc the\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth one major challenge with blood\nwork however is that most of the time it\ndoes not come back with any information\nabout what to do in order to move the\nvalues for hormones metabolic factors\nlipids Etc into the ranges that you want\nwith inside tracker changing those\nvalues becomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized dashboard\nthat you can use to address the\nnutrition-based behavior-based\nsupplement based approaches that you can\nuse in order to move those values into\nthe ranges that are optimal for you Your\nvitality and your longevity inside\ntracker now includes a measurement of\nAPO lipoprotein B so-called APO B and\nthey're all plan apob is a key marker of\ncardiovascular health and therefore\nthere's extreme value to knowing your\napob levels if you'd like to try inside\ntracker you can go to insidetracker.com\nhuberman to get 20 off any of inside\ntracker's plans again that's

teens\nand adults I'd love for you to share\nwith us your findings around this study\nthat you did of pregnant women\nand how stress and pregnancy and\ndifferent patterns of eating\nand physiological changes that people\nexperience during pregnancy could you\nshare with us what those findings were\nbecause I think those are relevant not\njust to people who are pregnant or\nplanning to become pregnant but to\neverybody because I think they shed\nlight on how we manage stress and\nsometimes how we fail to manage yeah so\nwith overweight and obesity we know we\ncan't just change calories it's just not\ngoing to work the next stressful event\nis going to come along and people will\nyou know go back to what their brain is\ndriving them to do is to you know binge\non comfort food and so we've done these\ninterventions with men and women that\nshow that we can help them regulate\nusing somebody's mindful eating\nstrategies or checking in\nwe wanted to do this with pregnant women\nbecause when you have excess weight and\nyou're pregnant you're really vulnerable\nto gaining excessive weight during\npregnancy which is not healthy for the\nmom or the The Offspring so we we did\nthis study it took us probably 10 years\ntotal to you know get the Grant and\nrecruit groups of 10 women who are\npregnant in the same stage and give them\nthis training and mindful eating mindful\nnutrition stress reduction and then my\ncolleague Nikki bush has been following\nthe babies for I think it's been almost\n10 years since then and here's what we\nfound\nfirst of all we couldn't stop excess\nweight gain the women in the control\ngroup gained about about 60 of them\ngained excess weight during pregnancy\nand same with our mindful group so maybe\nit's end of story you'd stop there and\nsay it fails don't do it there have been\nso many beautiful developments in the\nwomen who got the training that we just\nkeep are you know being shocked by how\nimpactful the stress reduction training\nwas it was just two months of their life\nbut but pregnancy is a very critical\nperiod when these women were changing\ntheir habits and they're very motivated\nto help their baby so here's what we\nfound\nwithin that first month of the\nintervention they all got this oral\nglucose tolerance test so they all had a\nthey got a blood test to see how well\ntheir body was metabolizing food sugar\nand so it's like a pre-diabetes test and\nwhat we found was that twice as many\nwomen in the no treatment control group\nhad impaired glucose tolerance during\npregnancy it's a it's a common high risk\nand half that many women had this in the\nmindfulness group so by reducing stress\nthey improved their insulin sensitivity\nduring pregnancy so imagine what that's\ndoing to the baby too then the babies\nhave come out with less obesity\nless illnesses in their first year of\nlife and more of this kind of healthy\nstress response when they've been\nstressed out in in the lab study\nand so then eight years later we looked\nat the mental health of the mom so right\nafter the intervention eight weeks later\neveryone in our mindfulness stressor I\ncan do it felt great they felt less\ndepressed they had less stress and less\nanxiety that's what you'd expect right I\nmean they've just gone to a weekly class\nthey got all the support but eight years\nlater they still showed improved mental\nhealth every year that we measured them\nthey still looked better so it's\nprobably one of the longest\nstudies looking at long-term effects of\na mindfulness training and I don't think\nit was a coincidence that was during\npregnancy I think this is a very\nimportant time to have these skills and\nbeing in a group adds that social\nsupport piece that we know is powerful\nit's an incredible result could you\nshare with us what the mindfulness\nintervention was and when it was\ninitiated when it was stopped so we're\ntalking about 10 minutes a day of\nmeditation as many details as you can\npossibly give us because I know\num even though I don't think I'll ever\nbe pregnant I don't plan on it and uh\nyou never know well um yeah hi\nzero minus one probability in my mind\nbut anyway maybe other people have other\nideas for me but\num zero minus one probability in my mind\nand yet I'm very interested in this\nmindfulness intervention because it\nsounds like a very potent one so much so\nthat it's multi having a\nmulti-generational impact so how many\nminutes a day\num how many days per week we had them\nthey met once a week we they had little\nreminder cards I mean we need all the\nreminders we can you know Post-its on\nthe fridge timers on our phone to do\nthis mindful check-in and so they were\nduring the week doing this check-in and\nit was simply\num\na mindful check in closing their eyes\nand feeling their body feeling their\nlabeling their emotions so it was\nmindful breathing\nand then it was some movement and we\ntaught them prenatal yoga but really any\nmind body movement people like different\nthings there's Qigong\num there's\nthere's\num even just slow walking would have\nworked\num so it was uh mindful check-in breathe\nmove my body that's what the reminder\ncard said so close your eyes and look\ninside do slow breathing they also put\ntheir hands on their belly and so they\nfelt that they were taking care of their\nbaby and then more movement so they they\ndid increase their walking\nand the mindful of check-ins are as we\nwere talking about at the very beginning\nI would say necessary but not sufficient\nwe've got to stop during the day and\ncheck in and look inside if we're not\naware of where our mind is we are just\nsubject to the you know believing the\nstressful thoughts thinking that we need\nto keep ruminating their sticky thoughts\nso the mindful check-in is really\nimportant and then I think the breathing\nas we've talked about is is probably the\nmore direct way that they're influencing\nthe prenatal environment the uterine\nenvironment to reduce the stress\nin that the baby's being exposed to and\nthe movement refocuses us from our mind\nand our ruminative thoughts\nto the experiences to what we feel in\nthe body there's even been a study that\nshowed that overweight people with a lot\nof Cravings if they do the body scan\nthat's simply focusing on the body from\nthe head to the toe you know just\nreminding ourselves to\nfocus on each part of the body breathe\ninto it release tension it's very basic\nand simple the body scan would\nsignificantly reduced cravings\nI mean to me that's it's really hard to\nreduce Cravings so like just that\nrefocusing on the body took away stress\nanxiety self-referential thoughts that\nkind of our favorite topic thinking\nabout ourselves thinking negative\nthoughts about ourselves to relaxing\nfeeling ease feeling well-being\nI can't help but ask about what that\nbody skin might have been doing at a\nlittle bit more of a mechanistic level\num some of the listeners might be\nfamiliar with these terms but some won't\nso I'll just um briefly Define them we\ncan perceive things in terms of extra\nreception or basically paying attention\nto and focusing on things beyond the\nconfines of our skin or interoception I\nrealize you know all this but for their\nsake\num no one really understands\ninteroception go for it so in\ninterception essentially the sensory the\nsensory innervation of the of the\ninternal organs of our own skin that\nincludes proprioception and which is our\nknowledge or our sense of where our\nlimbs are where we are relative to\ngravity all that stuff and you know it\nraises this body scan result that that\nis the fact that a brief body scan can\nreduce Cravings raises this question in\nmy mind which is is craving a heightened\nsense of inter-reception or heightened\nsense of extra reception so I could\nthink of one form of craving where for\ninstance the donut again donuts for me\nis in front of me and I'm saying\nthinking that I want that and so I'm\nalmost in complete extra reception but\nI'm Tethered to it like my internal\nworld is Tethered to the donut it's\nalmost like the donut is in control of\nme briefly\nright and then I eat it\num but it's hijacked your prefrontal\ncortex it's it's hijacked everything\nyeah yeah and then if I do a body scan\nso I'm putting myself in this experiment\nand it's kind of uh a hypothetical\nscenario I'm putting myself into this\nexperiment I do a body scan which\nwithout question is\nshifting me more towards interception\nright I'm focusing on my skin my heart\nrate all these things interception so I\ncould see how that would draw my\nattention off of the external stimulus\nand reduce craving and that makes me\nwonder whether or not craving is\na\nform of extra reception where our\ninterception is just exquisitely locked\nto extra reception and if so you know\nbecause I do think this is a remarkable\nresult it is very hard to stop Cravings\nI mean we had a guest on here a former\ncolleague of mine at Stanford who's now\nthe chair of neurosurgery at UPenn uh\nSchool Medicine which is Casey Halpern I\nmean they do they literally drill down\nthrough the skull of people who have\nbinge eating disorder and start\nstimulating different brain areas\nbecause these people are so out of\ncontrol in terms of their binge eating I\nmean that's the kind of intervention\nthat is considered necessary for a lot\nof folks who binge eat so here you're\ntelling me a body scan in some\nindividuals can reduce that and I have\nto wonder whether or not it's somehow\nbreaking that interoceptive\nextracceptive tether anyway I'm\nspeculating here but I'd love your\nthoughts on on binge on craving and\nbinging and breaking binging\num do you think that there are\nbehavioral interventions\num that could be layered on top of body\nscan should we all be doing body scans\nroutinely yes why not you know and some\npeople aren't going to like that lying\ndown is maybe not comfortable and so any\nMind Body activity is going to do the\nsame it's going to be you know I think\nbreaking that link\nthat you talked about yeah I I find this\nall intersective extra receptive\nbalancing um one of the more interesting\nconversations these days in Neuroscience\nbecause we're starting finally starting\nto understand what some of the the\ncircuitries are and they do link to\nthese reward Pathways in any event\num getting back to the relationship\ndoing stress and food and maybe even\njust weaving back a little bit to the uh\nopioid system\nhave there been any\nlong-term studies of stress intervention\nyou know in the studies that we do in\nour laboratory we get people for a month\nthey do one intervention we swap them to\nanother intervention a month we analyze\ndata takes a couple years to do all that\nbut we write papers and we move on\num it sounds like your laboratory has\nbeen involved in doing a lot of studies\nwhere you're examining people over a\nvery long period of time even their\nchildren what can we learn about the\nlong-term outcomes of things like body\nscans meditation and then we'll get into\nbreath work\nthere hasn't been that many long-term\nstudies of\nstress interventions now that you\nmention it I think the meditation\nstudies are probably the best example\nthere are some studies that have either\nfollowed people who have taken up\nmeditation or just these cross-sectional\nstudies where you compare a long-term\nmeditator to someone who's never\nmeditated and they they are interesting\nI mean let's talk about the\ncross-sectional studies you're already\nyou know studying someone who eats like\nkale chips instead of potato chips\nthere's a lot of differences in who\ndecides to be a meditator\nwe in terms of the\nhealth and biology\nwe have found that there is slower\nbiological aging and other people have\nfound that in these meditation\ninterventions we do the short-term ones\nthat inflammatory Pathways of gene\nexpression are dampened way down\nand cross-sectionally other people like\nElizabeth hoji have found longer\ntelomeres in the meditators versus the\ncontrols so we we haven't really found\ntelomere lengthening in our short-term\nmeditation studies but we do find boosts\nin telomerase activity which is this\nenzyme that protects our cell aging\nslows our cell aging rebuilds the\ntelomeres\nso those are um those are those are\nstudies that suggest if someone were to\ncontinue meditating they might keep up\nthat slower rate of Aging\nso there's one study we did which I\nthink was particularly\num fun we went to uh Retreat Center\nwhere Deepak Chopra leads us one week\nTranscendental Meditation Retreat so\npeople got a mantra and they were\nfocusing for probably eight hours a day\non different uh yoga meditation and\nreflective exercises and then we had\nhalf the group just walk around the\nresort take walks hear some boring\nHealth talks so that was our control\ngroup and what we found from that study\nwas that in the short run a week later\neveryone felt fantastic after the week\nright they weren't allowed to bring\ntheir laptop and work and they ate this\ngreat anti-inflammatory diet an\nayurvedic diet and then the gene\nexpression Pathways were like night and\nday from day one to the last day and our\nmodel of um machine learning model was\nable to identify people over 90 it could\nsay whether they're on day one or day\nseven and the difference really emerged\nover the long run we went and we\nfollowed them about 10 months later and\nwe found that not everyone felt great 10\nmonths later the group who learned\nmeditation still had lower depression\nbut the control group bounced right back\nup\nand then we looked a little bit further\nand we saw that people with early\nadversity benefited the most from the\nmeditation condition oh what was the\nmeditation condition how long per day\nyeah it well so they did they learned\ntranscendental primordial sound\nmeditation which is similar to TM where\nyou have a your focused attention on\nyour on a word over and over but there's\nalso more awareness of the\num the body\nand that was you know I I couldn't say\nhow many minutes a day but it was on and\noff during the day okay so repeatedly\nbut for a fairly short period of time\none week yeah all right yeah I've never\ndone one of these extended meditation\nRetreats are you interested well various\npeople in my life have told me that I\nneeded to go do a silent meditation but\nthey probably were emphasizing the\nsilent part the um uh I recommend them I\nthink they're amazing ways to get to\nknow the mind and to really calm the\nbody in ways like a you know a Quantum\nshift in our level of stress that we\ndon't get it's very hard to get in short\nbounce\nI do a daily meditation practice but\nit's a relatively brief meditation\npractice I do tend to focus more on\nthings like deliberate cold exposure and\nbreath work and yes exercise and\nsunlight and all the things I talk about\non the podcast but I'm certainly not\naverse to uh doing a longer meditation\nare all of these\num uh TMA meditations are they silent\nmeditations\nand they range from what two days to a\nweek is that\nwell the Retreats you can always find a\nretreat that's you know half a day one\nday a week two weeks so you don't go\nright into a two-week you work up to it\nso the longest I've ever done is a\ntwo-week silent Meditation Retreat and\nthat was after you know 10 years of\ndoing yearly shorter retreats and then\nwhen you you know I think it would be\ntoo hard and stressful if you haven't\nbeen able to I mean meditation can be\nstressful if you know you think that\nyou're failing at it and\num so you need to have kind of developed\nthe skill a little bit before you go on\nthe Retreats and so lots of classes can\ndo that and online but I think the short\nbouts every day are that is what is the\nmost important message for people for\nfor managing daily stress and that's the\nin the stress prescription it's very\nmuch about how we can do short daily\nnudges to reduce our stress arousal so\nbreathing is one of the best body-based\nexamples of getting right there but\nthere are other ways so being in nature\nthat's a really strong stimulus an\nenvironment that sends all sorts of\nsafety signals to us\nyeah certainly it's not an either or but\nit seems like nowadays A lot of the\ndiscussion that used to be had around\nmeditation and its ability to evoke\nneuroplasticity and things of that sort\nhas shifted over to it um an increased\nfocus on psychedelics so the common\ntheme on this podcast but it just seems\nlike in you know taking the pulse of\nsocial media and the landscape out there\nthere's so much excitement about\npsilocybin both in microdose and macro\ndose and MDMA and some of the other\ntrials that are out there\nthat\nmany people are starting to forget the\nincredibly rich and vast literature\nsupporting the use of even brief\nmeditation practices for reshaping the\nmind so I'm glad that um we're talking\nabout meditation but I mean even going\ninto plants medicine experiences is\nenhanced if you have a little bit of\ntraining in how to in metacognition how\nto view the mind and thoughts you can\nobserve the whole experience with that\nmuch more kind of calmness skill and\nwisdom knowing this is just the mind\ndoing these cool things so it's not\nthey're not separate and then I think\nthe the psilocybin experiences enhance\ndaily meditation so they really go well\ntogether\nyeah and then just as a little editorial\non uh psychedelics\num what's interesting I think about the\nclinical data is that\num you know we think of the the\nPsychedelic Journey as the time in which\nall the changes occur because it has all\nthese properties of hallucinations and\naltered thinking Etc that acts as kind\nof a gravitational pull around our our\nideas about what psychedelics do but\nit's actually in the window after the\nPsychedelic Journey that the actual\nrewiring of the rain takes place so when\npeople talk about integration afterwards\nthey're not just talking about the few\nhours where they're you know parachuting\nback down to to uh uh typical\nConsciousness let's call it that but\nthat there's these long perhaps even\nweeks or month-long tale of plasticity\nand that's actually when most of the\nrewiring is happening and which I find\nreally interesting which is not unlike\nmeditation where sure in one bout of\nmeditation you might see a adjustment or\nrewiring of the brain but at least from\nthe book altered traits which I'm a big\nfan of\num talked about these daily repeated\nshort meditations or these longer TM\nRetreats as they're sometimes called\nalmond inducing uh this big time brain\nplasticity all right well I'm now I'm\ngonna have to do it and I'll report back\nto everybody uh what my experience was\nalthough I might do it silently\num\nI'd love to talk a little bit about some\nof the other health metrics that you've\nexplored not just in the context of\nmindfulness but I'm particularly\nintrigued by uh a graph here I'm showing\nmy really nerdy side there's a graph in\none of your papers it's the Picard paper\n2018 we will provide a link to to this\nin the show note captions if people want\nto take a look but it essentially\ndescribes the relationship between\nmitochondrial health and mood\num in the context of people who have\ndifferent type of mood Tendencies if you\num if you would be willing to just kind\nof describe the top Contour of that\nstudy and some of the the points that\nthat you find most interesting I think\nit's a fascinating study and and I I'm\nso glad you did it but I'll let you tell\nus about it yeah we've we've done these\nin-depth studies where we are looking at\npeople under a lot of daily demand\ncaregivers and then we look and look at\nyou know normal people parents of\nneurotypical children who still have a\nlot of stress but we that we then ask\nyou know does do people under chronic\nstress have accelerated aging so we look\nat telomeres epigenetics mitochondrial\nhealth and then what explains those who\nlooked really good who look resilient\nand don't look vulnerable and so then we\ncan find out like what's the magic sauce\nin the day that protects them from\nchronic stress so Martin bakar my\ncolleague who has been obsessed with\nmitochondrial Health as a pathway to\nunderstanding both stress address and\nreally health and disease he has\ndeveloped a way to measure mitochondrial\nin health in humans so we can measure a\nbunch of enzymes and then we can adjust\nit for how many mitochondria we have so\nwe have this really nice index we can\nget from the blood\nand in this study of\nyoung mothers who were who had either\ntypical children or children with autism\nwe found that the caregiving moms had\nsignificantly lower or dampened\nmitochondrial activity what that means\nis they can't produce as much energy so\nif they're feeling more exhausted from\nthe chronic stress we know why I mean\nit's it really is a it was quite\ndramatic and Martin commented some of\nthose low levels even looked like people\nwith some genetic reasons to have low\nmitochondrial activity but here's the\nbeauty of that study we then get to look\nwithin their day at their mood and ask\nwell what about the caregivers who have\nreally great mitochondrial\nenzymes and and thus should be making a\nlot of ATP they had more positive\nemotions both waking up and in the\nevening but especially in the evening\nand what's so interesting that is all of\nthese daily diary studies of stress and\nmood\none of the things we know that matters\nfor long-term health is how positive you\nfeel at night so especially on a\nstressful day so at the end of a\nstressful day can you muster from some\nfeelings of content ease confidence Joy\ndo you have any of that or has it just\nwiped out your positivity and so for\npeople who feel\neither lower negative or higher positive\nthey tend to have better health\ntrajectories so like a decade later less\ndepression less heart disease less early\ndeath so what so that's why we care so\nmuch about daily moods and in our study\nit looks like the daily mood was really\nquite correlated with the mitochondria\nlevels that same day then we measured\nmood like you know days away from that\nit was much less correlated so that it's\njust our first study on this but it\nreally leads us to think that our\nmitochondria are sensitive to our\nthoughts and our feelings probably on a\ndaily basis\nincredible so for those of us that find\nourselves in it in a state of chronic\nstress and here I'm talking about the\nkind of stress that you mentioned before\nwhich is you know they're\nis unlikely to be a Simple Solution like\nwe're just going to be grappling with\nthis thing\num and you mentioned the words radical\nacceptance which I'd like to uh drill\ninto a little bit too because there's a\ntheme in the self-help literature and\nit's a\ntheme that now I think in the formal\npsychology literature actually\num was talking to a dialectical\ndialectical psychology expert recently I\nthink that's the the correct title\ndialectical behavioral therapy correct\nyeah that's a common great one yeah\nyou're correct I I was I was grasping\nand um that's correct and they were I'm\ntalking about\num some of the misconceptions about\nradical acceptance because I think a lot\nof people hear the words radical\nacceptance at least this is what they\nthey told me and think oh that means\nthat you have to just accept what is and\ndeal with it there's another form of\nradical acceptance which is ironically\naccept the fact that I'm not going to\ndeal with this right I'm gonna walk away\nfrom it but what you're talking about is\nchronic stress of the sort that really\nthe stress or the fact that a very close\nrelative or family member is dealing\nwith a lifelong condition or the fact\nthat um we can't extract ourselves from\na situation that we are not in full\nagency to remove the stressor\nthat\nradical acceptance of that fact then can\nratchet into an understanding of okay\nand yet there are tools that we can use\nto not just offset the negative health\neffects but maybe even thrive in the\ncontext of this essentially turning what\ninitially was thought of as a curse into\na blessing at least biologically\nspeaking\nwhat are the data around the practices\nthat can help make that conversion\npossible I realize there's a lot of\npsychological work that needs to be done\nongoing people need coping mechanisms\nsupport groups it's always better to\nhave more social support than last of\ncourse but are we\nagain talking about\na daily mindfulness practice or is it\ndaily mindfulness of a certain type what\ndo we know about best practices for\nmitigating these essentially\nnon-negotiable stressors\nit's\nit's a great question and it's not a\nquick answer\nI think it is partly how we view life\nand our\nour purpose in our own life\nwhat's this game that you know we were\nborn into and even just the idea that\nbad things shouldn't happen sets us up\nfor vulnerability to feel victimized to\nfeel\num like we can't you know accept bad\nthings that have happened so so just\nstepping back and asking\neveryone listening do you have a\nsituation in your life that is unwanted\nand you can't change\nit could be small it could be huge\nhow much time do you spend thinking\nabout this\nthe more we spend time trying to problem\nsolve or worry or just wishing things\nwere different\nthe more we are creating\na chronic stress state\nand so just even\ntaking that first kind of step back to\nget perspective on what are the\nsituations in my life that stress me out\nand and which of these can I Circle\nthose that I can't change\nthey're still they're on my list so\nthey're they're on my mind they're still\nupsetting they haven't receded in the\nbackground they haven't gone away just\nthat recognition of this isn't going to\ngo away is incredibly\npowerful because we can as I say put the\nbaggage down and give ourselves some\nrelief and some freedom from from the\nbig space it holds in our mind and in\nour body\nand this is not a one-time thing it's a\npractice radical acceptance is something\nwe practice over and over to help us\nloosen our grip on unwanted situations\non letting them control our well-being\nand taking up you know this mental real\nestate that's so precious our attention\nso I would\num\nthere are statements that we can say\nthat help us\nand it's I have you know there are a few\nmetaphors so I'm an expert at this\nbecause I have I'm a caregiver and I\noften need to refocus from wishing\nthings were different trying to solve\nthings to\nreally\num radical acceptance of this is how\nthings are right now this is the reality\nand\nby just reminding ourselves that there\nis freedom within that that there are\nthings that you can do you can actually\nlive better live well with these\nsituations so let me tell you what we\nfound from our caregivers we measure\nwhere their mind is at night we we ping\nthem and we say in the last five minutes\nhow much have you been wishing things\nwere different\nhow much have you been engaged and\nfocused and what you're doing right\nright before we pinged you and just\nthose two questions\ntell us so much about that person's\nwell-being so people and actually yes\nthe caregivers are doing more of\nwhat I'll call suffering wishing things\nwere different not being present for\ntheir lives but regardless of that\ndifference whether people are a\ncaregiver or not this negative\nmind-watering state of not being present\nfor your evening wishing things were\ndifferent instead of being engaged\npredicts\nmore unhappiness it predicts\nshorter telomeres\nso it suggests that it's a pattern that\nhas gone on for days months and years\nthat has been wearing on them\nand so some of the metaphors that I\nthink are helpful for this are thinking\nof yourself think of this unwanted\nsituation and think of how your\nyour pulling a rope that's attached to a\nbrick wall\nand you're doing that because you care\nyou want things to be better for\nyourself or this person\nand\nor a group I mean it's it's something\nyou're passionate about\nand so you're pulling and pulling and\nevery day you're pulling and and you\ncan't move that brick wall so the only\nthing that's happening is that you're\nchafing your hands that tinge that\nchronic tension\nwhat if you just drop the Rope\nI say that to myself drop the Rope\nwhen I start get you know getting going\non trying to solve unsolvable problems\nthe brick wall is still there it's never\ngoing to move yet my hands are free\nand so I can be freed up to live in the\nways that I do have control over to do\nthings that help around the edges so I\nwas just talking with someone who's just\nso concerned about their aging parents\nand you know them not getting the care\nthey need not taking care of themselves\nyou know things aren't going well but\nthere was so little that they could do\nto help their parents and so by dropping\nthe Rope for them meant realizing there\nwere things they could do being present\nbeing loving\nuh doing the little bit of care that\nthey could from a distance was all they\ncould do and that's enough that's that\nloving presence is like a gift that we\ndon't realize that we we always have\nthat to give\nwhere do you think the tenancy for us to\ntry and pull on brick walls comes from I\nmean it's so non-adaptive\num and I've also heard it stated that\npeople do this in the reverse Direction\ntoo meaning in time trying to control\nthe past\nthrough current behaviors as well as try\nand control the future\num so give me an example of that yeah\nthis is something I learned from a guest\nwe had on here Dr Paul Conti is a\npsychiatrist to\num extremely skilled psychiatrist who\nwrote a book on trauma which I think is\nthe best book on trauma frankly\num and he talked about how the limbic\nsystem that engages these\nfight-or-flight responses has no sense\nof time and that's why developmental\nscripts get reactivated in particular\nparent child or caretaker child uh\nneural circuits that were engaged in\nthose relationships when we were really\nyoung get reactivated in adult\nrelationships I mean in some sense it\ndoesn't make any sense like why wouldn't\nthe human mind have separate circuits\nfor adult like romantic attachment\nversus child parent attachment is all\nsounding very Freudian And yet when you\nlook at the the neural Imaging it's like\nyou get one set of circuits for\nunderstanding of relationship of course\nyou adjust according to context and they\nget repurposed you don't just set that\naside say that was for childhood but\nwhat he said was that the limbic system\nand the stress system when it's\nactivated\num distorts our perception of time\nand that\num this is what he was uh saying leads\nto the what's sometimes called the\nrepetition compulsion people try and\nwill repeat the same uh Place themselves\ninto mildly to severely traumatic\ncircumstances over and over again\ndespite the presence of a of a trauma it\ndoesn't have to be childhood trauma you\nthink well that doesn't make any sense\nit's like the most illogical thing in\nthe world like you get burned on the\nstove or you keep going back to the\nstove and the idea is that these\ncircuits when they get activated really\nengage entire like cognitive scripts\nthat make it very hard to escape it's\nlike it pulls you into a story that is\nexquisitely hard to to get away from it\nso that this repetition compulsion is an\nattempt to try and rewrite the story and\nthis is this is a theory not just a\nFreudian psychology but kind of modern\ntrauma and Neuroscience informed trauma\ntherapies in any event\nas you describe the this pulling on a\nbrick wall I find a very compelling\nimage\num and one that uh makes total sense to\ntry and drop the Rope as you describe it\nbecause of the incredibly High energetic\ndemand that pulling on that Rogue\nrepresents as you said it's sort of a\nway of diverting resources towards\nsomething that has no conclusion right\nand in dropping the Rope you can divert\nthose resources towards other things\num so I was just curious again I wasn't\nconsulted with the design phase and I'm\nassuming you weren't either but you know\nwhat I wonder what what in US uh a\nscientists I'm just kind of doing the\nDuncan experiment here like I wonder\nwhat in US as human beings compels us to\num try and change what we the\nunchangeable\nwe\nreally really really love control\nand we want to control the future\nnot just because it makes us feel\npowerful and happy but because then we\ncan relax\nif we know what's going to happen next\nif it's predictable\nwe're that much happier we're not\nVigilant and looking ahead and being\nprepared for what might happen so let me\nask you that so I have two whole\nchapters in the stress prescription one\nis on uncertainty and one is on control\nand these drive us crazy until we can\nsomewhat master and understand how\nlittle control we have and how much\nuncertainty there is and will always be\nso let me ask you this if you couldn't\nplan your day tomorrow\nand you wanted to\nknows with certainty what your plans are\nwhat was going to happen\nhow\nmuch ease and relaxation\nwould you feel at the not knowing what's\ngoing to happen tomorrow very little\nso like on a one through ten scale how\nmuch would that drive you crazy\ntomorrow Saturday so I'm a little more\nflexible on Monday\noh no Mondays I Mondays are mine I own\nMonday no I'm kidding I'm just kidding I\nlove Mondays it's always been my\nfavorite day of the week\num\nuh even when I was in school uh\nyeah that would be on it that would be a\nsix yeah six out of ten and that's not\nunusual and we have a scale to measure\nhow comfortable people are with\ncertainty and what we already knew was\nthat\nbeing comfortable with uncertainty is a\nbeautiful but rare resilience Factor\npeople who tolerate uncertainty have\nmuch less anxiety and depression and\nwhen stressful things happen they get\nover it more quickly so we measure this\nduring the pandemic and what we found\nwas that intolerance of uncertainty\npretty strongly predicted pandemic\nanxiety PTSD depression and\ndistress about the fires the climate the\nclimate situation in in California\nso this is interesting I mean is this\nlike a fixed personality and we're just\nstuck with our rigidity around wanting\ncertainty or is this something that we\nlike a muscle that we can build\nso\nI think it's the latter and I think\nthere are practices we can do that help\nus feel ease with the uncertain future\nsome of these mindful check-ins\nnoticing that we are carrying around\nuncertainty stress\nis one way and then reframing\nuncertainty\nas the beauty of the mystery of life and\nthe freedom that we can feel when we\nrealize we don't control tomorrow\nwe just go with it and we you know we do\nour best and what\nDelight there is in just viewing things\nwith curiosity and just seeing what\nemerges so even just our posture here's\nan exercise for dealing with uncertainty\ninstead of like kind of that alert\nposture when we're like trying to take\nit all in and predict the next Second\nand like just\nlean back\nand take some slow breaths we know\nthat's going to help Orient us\nand realize that we can actually face\ntime in that way by letting it come to\nus\nand receiving what happens\nand that's a completely different body\nstance than our usual go mode during the\nday and that's just a way of saying\nI am in a you know receptive mode and\nI'm going to just be curious about what\narises\nand so I actually learned that on a\nMeditation Retreat because I tend to be\ntype A and I'll leave a retreat going\nfrom like very relaxed to like that\nleaning forward tense of like where's\nthe to-do list and so carrying with me\nthat posture of like just see let\ntime unfold as it will without trying to\ncontrol things\nit's really interesting it gets right to\nthe heart of something that I spent a\nlot of time thinking about in the\ncontext of\nStress Management and also just general\nthriving which is that I think that\num\nabout half of the messages that we get\nrelated to stress and mind-body\ninterventions relate to adopting this\nforward Center of mass\nthis idea of okay stress can\ngive us early dementia stress can limit\nour sleep stress can Empower cognition\nor\nstress can make us more resilient stress\ncan activate all sorts of positive\nanti-inflammatory Pathways as well that\nthe mindset matters and here I'm\nI'm doing a terrible job of it but I'm\ntrying to scrape off and capture the top\nuh Contour of the beautiful work of my\ncolleague Dr Alia Crum who's yes you\nknow love her work feeling this podcast\nand is a huge fan of her work as well\nand with that mindset matters because it\nshapes physiology\nfor sure it uh her data point to that so\nthere are these kind of forward Center\nof mass type uh approaches\num and these are abundant on social\nmedia\num you know different people come to\nmind\ndifferent archetypes really have emerged\nyou know millions and millions of\nfollowers that are the archetypes of\nwhen challenge arises you smash into it\nyou go through it right\num\nand then on the other hand there are the\nstress mitigation techniques both mental\nand physical body oriented mind oriented\nEtc that are more of the sort that you\ndescribed that are\num they're not\num being back on your heels so to speak\nlike letting things bulldoze you but are\nmore of this receptive mode and of more\nof an awareness mode exactly and I think\nthat um since here we are at the table\nto researchers who focus on these issues\na lot do you think it's fair for us to\nadopt a sort of a general framework and\nmodel that that perhaps people can adopt\nfor themselves if they like that that of\ncourse it's not an either or but that\nhaving both of these in one's kit\nof tools could be valuable because one\nis less energetically demanding but of\ncourse offers less opportunity for\nagency or at least apparently so that's\nthe leaning back and then the the other\nis certainly gives an opportunity for\nagency but we know from 100 years or\nmore of psychology and psychiatric\nliterature and from the emerging\nliterature on stress mitigation that\nit's work it's not something that is\nwithout a cost it can get you far better\nresults than it were you to just let\nstress bulldoze you but that it's work\nand so we have to emphasize that work\num in very deliberate ways exactly I\ncouldn't agree more it's work\nwhen we know it's productive we should\nwork and when we know there's a brick\nwall we should let go so I think I like\nthis forward Mass idea I think of it as\nyou muscle it\nand or you release it and we need both\nand so that letting go is a really\nimportant wise you know Discerning way\nto mitigate stress in the right\nsituations in the right time and you\nknow we can't muscle through everything\nright so another way I like to think\nabout it is just the waves of life like\nI mean we are in an ocean and we have\nsmall waves we have big waves some of\nthese tidal waves are going to hit all\nof us the global stressors the the\nclimate disasters that will come and so\nwhen we're not in the middle of a wave\nwhich is when we need to muscle it we're\nbetween waves how much control do we\nhave to fight the tide there\nsome it's not black or white we we are\nwe we can't fight a Riptide we need to\ngo the direction of the tide but we can\nhave some control in our Direction and\nit kind of goes back to\num our colleague Robert sapolski's very\nbiologically based idea of us having you\nknow he's a little bit extreme with a no\nfree will we are we are influenced by\nall of these things around us as well as\nall of our biological you know I'll say\num brilliant evolutionary animal\ninstincts so given all of that\nwe have\nsome\ndeterministic forces on us and within\nthat we get to ease up between the waves\nwhen we can we get to change our\nDirection but we're always going to be\nhit by the next wave and so it's this\nskillful surfing or navigating that we\ncan do better when we realize when we\ncontrol things when we can't when we can\ntruly feel safe and have ease versus\nwhen we need to kind of gently paddle\nwhat do you think is the value of\njournaling and and placing one's own\nnarrative on stressful circumstances\nespecially these non-negotiable\ncircumstances again I'm fascinated by\nthese because I think it's a category of\nstress that's not often talked about and\nyet it's so prominent some people say\nokay you know dealing with short-term\nstress okay well my lab would say like\nuse physiological size or raise your\nstress threshold and we'll get back to\nthat in a little bit\num as it relates to the work you're\ndoing with breath work but\nso many stressors are going to take a\nyear five years we don't know you know\nthe uncertainty that you mentioned\nearlier or the the certainty that this\nis going to go on forever and so you\nknow what is the\num you know for for people that are\nlistening to this and that and want to\nstart to adopt practices\num do you think that spending some time\ncreating a written or a spoken narrative\nis helpful I mean we hear this but are\nthere any data that support the use of\njournaling as a as a tool I seem to\nrecall that there are a few studies out\nthere but I can't I can't remember\nexactly yeah definitely creating a\ncoherent narrative is\ncritical to our ability to make sense\nFind meaning find resolution have a\nsocial identity around\nour lived experience what happens to us\nso narrative is kind of everything right\nin stress research it's it's not what\nhappens to us it's how we're\ninterpreting it and how we're\num how we're responding to it and I've\nheard you say the exact same thing when\nyou've talked about what is stress it's\nit's really what narrative we're\ncreating around it so I think a\nnarrative of purpose fill in the blank\nabout what your what's meaningful to you\nbut that is why we're different than\njust the the\num the rats that we study or the monkeys\nlike they have these amazing\nstress responses that are we have them\ntoo and we can't control that but we\nhave the ability to do this projection\nto the Future to ask what is our purpose\nin life to see and know that we are\ngoing to die and we can have some\ncontrol over how we live\nand maybe even how we die and how we\nwant to be remembered that is so\nbeautiful that helps us Rise Above This\nbeing monkeys and clothes\nI'd love before we wrap for us to return\nto this uh question about breath work\nand the study that you're doing one of\nthe I've known about your work for a\nvery long time admired it for a very\nlong time and one of the things that um\nexcited me about being able to sit down\nwith you today is that uh our\nLaboratories studied breath work your\nlaboratory studying breath work and um\nand I know that you've been\ndoing a study on the so-called Wim Hof\nmethod\num which of I'll let you familiarize our\nlisteners to some of them are familiar\nwith the Wim Hof method others are not I\nthink a lot of people think of a whim in\nterms of his role as the Iceman because\nof cold exposure but of course he has um\nbreath work practices that mirror\num things like tumor breathing and other\nthings but maybe you could tell us a\nlittle bit about what you're doing there\nand what you're interested in\ndiscovering I realize it's too early to\ngive us the results but hopefully\nthey'll come back and do that at another\ntime but\nwhat is the study what motivated the\nstudy and maybe I can convince you to\ngive us a little teaser of what you're\ndiscovering so for um I I for many years\nI mean I think my\num first paper when I was a graduate\nstudent with Boost McEwen was about this\nidea of positive physiological stress\nand so I've always been wanting to\nreally understand what's positive stress\nhow can we induce it and instead for\nmany many too many years I've been\nstudying the dark side toxic stress\ntrauma caregiving and how that is can\ntake a toll on the body without the\nright resilience and resources and now\nI'm very excited about the uh\nthe opportunity to just focus on\ndifferent ways that we can stress out\nour body and mind in short-term bursts\nthat might promote stress resilience and\nthe body-based strategies are concrete\nthey're quick they're um they're\nalso my favorite strategies I I probably\nhave internalized a lot of the mindsets\nand the you know the things that I've\nlearned from meditation and what I feel\nthe biggest bang for the buck is you\nknow if I'm\num waking up like super jittery with a\nbig stress response because of X or Y it\nis actually something like a hit type\nworkout or taking the dogs for like a\nreally brisk walk or like burning up\nthat energy and my body is\num a very big effect size for me\npersonally everyone has their you know\ndifferent ways that they can see the\nbiggest shifts in Daily stress\nso I've been looking for ways to create\npositive stress besides exercise we all\nknow about exercise and I met Wim Hof at\na uh a meeting where we talked kind of\nback to back and so we hadn't I had kind\nof heard something about you know crazy\nIceman climbing up the Himalayas I\nreally had he has 27 or more World\nRecords yeah for that sort of thing yeah\nso he so I got to hear I got to do the\nbreathing with him during this\nconference and I just felt like Elation\nafterwards I was like what was that and\nthen he heard about telomeres and he was\nlike I need to know if my method is\naffecting cell aging he loves research\nand so we he helped us design a study\nthat we've been working on at UCS staff\num with my colleagues Wendy Mendez and\nEric Prather it's been many years and\nit's funded by the John W brick\nFoundation which is very focused on what\nare non-drugway ways that we can help\nmental health\nso it was a very good fit for all of us\nto come together and design the study\nand we have been basically comparing\nlow arousal relaxation methods\nmindfulness slow breathing to positive\nstress exercise and Wim Huff method and\none of the things that we've learned in\na big way is that regardless of whether\nwe're creating deep states of ease or\nhermetic stress in the body that\nshort-term burst of either aerobic\nactivity or the extreme breathing\npeople feel better period so three weeks\nlater after this experiment of doing\ntheir practice every day they were\neither randomly assigned to the high\narousal or the low arousal the level of\nstress anxiety and depression fell\ndramatically in everyone so many paths\nto changes in stress there are probably\nvery different physiological Pathways\nand and we can talk about that more when\nwe get to really look in depth at our\nphysiological data as well as our\nblood-based data but what we do know is\nthat the Wim Hof method did create daily\npositive emotion that increased over\ntime just like your study on sighing and\nso even though there are different\nmechanisms they were selectively\nboosting feelings of positivity I love\nthat you know that's very unusual to get\na very selective positive effect\nsuper interesting I can't wait to hear\nmore about the data so I gather and by\nthe way no is a perfectly fine answer I\ngather that you're not going to tell us\nabout the whether or not there are\ntelomere changes yet or maybe that's not\npossible\num to detect in this kind of short-term\nstudy so what we're going to look at we\ndon't really think that telomeres can\nchange very quickly and telomerase May\nso we're going to look at mitochondrial\nenzymes telomerase and gene expression\npatterns and as you know we can look at\nmany different mechanisms and Pathways\nwith gene expression patterns especially\nwith these new kind of\nessays where you can look at you know\nseven thousand different uh proteins\nlike the Soma logic and so we'll get to\nsee well what's the pat you know did we\nreally change patterns of acute stress\nwith these different types of stress\nresilience interventions and in terms of\nthe physiological reactivity there are\nways that we can\nexamine both the stress response system\nsympathetic nervous system and the\nparasympathetic response system and I\nwill tell you that um while we're still\npreparing the results there were very\ndifferent profiles from the different\ninterventions that make us think that\nthere's a lot of specificity even though\neveryone feels better the the way that\nthey got there is very different in ways\nthat we're impacting both the nervous\nsystem and the Brain\nincredible and um I have to say when I\nheard that you were studying Wim Hof\nmethod I was positively uh delighted\nbecause I uh\nI I find that there are so few\nserious researchers in\nthe realm of of modern science that are\nboth explorers and then take what\nthey've um you know gleaned from those\nExplorations and then take it to the\nlaboratory and and put rigor on those\nand really try and parse mechanism with\nwith of course all the open-mindedness\nto whatever the outcome happens to be\nright I mean good science involves\num necessarily asking questions alone\nbut\num raising hypotheses and being\ncomfortable for those hypothesis\nhypotheses to be correct or not correct\nand I find your work to be just so\nincredibly creative and brave in that\nway and I love the way that you've\nmeshed different aspects of your own\npersonal journey into these different\npractices I don't know what came first\nthe science of the practices but I I\nhave uh I have my guesses but\num\nI must say it's it's very refreshing and\nI think it's exactly exactly what the\nworld needs right now in terms of tools\nfor mental health and physical health\nbecause\num far too many studies uh try and\nisolate variables without understanding\na larger context of like what are the\ndifferent types of stressors and clearly\nyou're addressing that or you know\nthere's this thing breath work that some\npeople might think oh you know the\nIceman Wim Hof it's really esoteric and\nyou know kind of crazy\num I'm certainly not saying that but you\nsay well what are the critical elements\nfrom that that we might be able to\nextract to understand this positive\neustress phenomena so I just um for I\nwant to first of all just say thank you\nfor doing the incredibly important work\nyou do and thank you I mean we were so\ndelighted to\num see the paper you did with David\nSpiegel and to know that you're pursuing\nthis path and\num it's very reassuring with your rigor\nand your you know depth of background I\nI agree with you this these are the\ntypes of studies we need we're releasing\nthe inherent\npower of Rejuvenation that's in our body\nis UNT It's relatively untapped in these\nrigorous controlled studies and we just\ncan't reduce inflammation with a drug we\ncan't reduce stress with a drug we\ndesperately need to learn how to use you\nknow the whole range of the nervous\nsystem from the acute stress to the deep\nrelaxation to heal and to promote these\nhealthy resilient States\ncouldn't agree more and UCSF is very\nvery fortunate to have you and should\nthey ever forget that please come to\nStanford instead maybe we can recruit\nyou away from UCSF and I'm here I'm\nbeing friendly to my colleagues at UCSF\nbut um they better treat you right or\nelse we're coming for you uh and I also\njust want to thank you for taking the\ntime today to share this information\nalso you've written wonderful books we\nwill provide a link to the newest one\nand I'll\num of course cue people to that because\nit sounds like a very rich source of\ninformation and actionable tools that\npeople can take in terms of mitigating\nstress and I I love the idea that\nthere's this discussion about certainty\nand control uh to elements that are very\nprominent in in my life um for better\nfor worse and all of us all of us yeah\nand so really thank you for the work\nyou're doing thank you for taking the\ntime to share that work through books\nand through podcasts and especially\ntoday on this one I I know I speak on\nbehalf of many many people and I just\nreally want extend my gratitude thank\nyou so much and thank you for for your\npodcast well it's a labor of love and\nit's days like today and discussions\nlike this that make
