    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we are\ndiscussing dopamine dopamine is a topic\nthat I've covered before on this podcast\nand many people have heard of dopamine\nmost people know that dopamine is\ninvolved in pleasure to some extent or\nanother and nowadays people are starting\nto appreciate that dopamine is also\nintimately involved with motivation\ndrive and pursuit\nwell today you're going to learn that\nindeed dopamine is responsible for all\nof those things but you are also going\nto learn that dopamine is critical for\novercoming procrastination for ensuring\nongoing motivation and indeed for\nensuring confidence in fact we are going\nto talk about the relationship between\ndopamine and motivation and confidence\nat the level of neurobiological\ncircuitry and we are going to cover\ntools that will allow you to leverage\nyour dopamine in order to have a maximum\nmotivation to overcome sticking points\nwhich include things like\nprocrastination but also by\nunderstanding the neural circuits in the\nbrain and body that release and use\ndopamine but more importantly by\nunderstanding what are called dopamine\ndynamics that is what gives rise to Big\npeaks in dopamine or troughs in dopamine\nor what's referred to as our Baseline\nlevel of dopamine which turns out to be\nour Baseline levels of motivation and\nfeelings of well-being by understanding\nhow those things relate to one another I\nassure you that by the end of today's\nepisode you will be in a far better\nposition to understand why you become a\nmotivated why you procrastinate how to\nensure motivation on an ongoing basis\nand even how to leverage effort and the\ndesire to become motivated as a way to\ndo just that to become more motivated\ntoday's discussion is not about\npsychology although I will center around\npractical everyday examples and offer\nmany many tools that you can Implement\nif you choose today's discussion is\nreally about pulling apart these things\nthat we call motivation reward pleasure\nprocrastination and understanding them\nin terms of their dopamine Dynamics so\nwhether you've heard me or others talk\nabout dopamine before or whether or not\ntoday is your first exposure to the\ntopic of dopamine today's episode is\nreally designed to give you the\nbiological and practical knowledge so\nthat you can leverage your dopamine\ncircuitry and your dopamine levels as\nwell as tools to adjust dopamine\ncircuitry and levels in order to\noptimize mental health physical health\nand performance before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep\nHelix sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are the absolute highest quality\nI've talked many times before on this\nand other podcasts about the critical\nrole that sleep plays in allowing you to\nbe awake and alert and have a good\nelevated mood throughout the day sleep\nis just fundamental to our mental health\nphysical health and performance and\nthere's no replacing great sleep a key\nthing we all need in order to get\nexcellent sleep is to have an ideal\nsleep environment Helix mattresses are\ndesigned for your unique sleep needs in\norder to ensure that you get the best\npossible night's sleep so if you go to\nthe Helix site and you take their very\nbrief two or three minute quiz it will\nask you questions such as do you sleep\non your side your back or your stomach\ndo you tend to run hot or cold\nthroughout the night and they will match\nyou to a mattress that's specific to\nyour sleep needs I match to the dusk\nmattress that's the one that works for\nme and since sleeping on the dusk\nmattress now for well over two years\nI've been sleeping better than I ever\nhave before so if you go to their site\nyou take the quiz and you figure out\nwhat's the ideal mattress for you just\ngo to helixsleep.com huberman take their\ntwo-minute sleep quiz and they'll match\nyou to a customized mattress and you'll\nget up to 350 off any mattress order and\ntwo free pillows again if interested you\ncan go to helixsleep.com huberman for up\nto 350 off and two free pillows today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by whoop\nwhoop is a fitness wearable device that\ntracks your daily activity and sleep but\nalso goes beyond that by providing\nreal-time feedback on how to adjust your\nphysical training and sleep schedule and\nother activities throughout your day in\norder to optimize your health I've been\nworking with whoop on their scientific\nadvisory Council to help Advance whoops\ntechnology and mission of unlocking\nHuman Performance not just for athletes\nbut for everybody as a whoop user I've\nexperienced the health benefits of their\ntechnology firsthand for instance it\ntells me of course whether or not I had\na good night's sleep or a poor night\nsleep by giving me a sleep score it\ntells me the percentage of rapid eye\nmovement sleep to slow wave sleep but\nwhoop also tells me for instance whether\nor not certain activities during my day\ntime such as naps or training or\ntraining of a certain amount of\nintensity how that's impacting my sleep\nand vice versa if you're interested in\ntrying whoop you can go to join.woop.com\nhuberman again that join.woop.com\nhuberman today and you'll get your first\nmonth free today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by Roka Roka makes\neyeglasses and sunglasses that are\nuniquely tailored to the needs of\nathletes and everyday people the company\nwas founded by two All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything about Roca\neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed\nwith the biology the visual system in\nmind I've spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology of the visual system and I\ncan tell you that your visual system has\nto contend with enormous number of\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly Roca eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are designed such that when\nyou go from one environment to the next\nlike a brightly lit environment to a\nless a brightly lit environment you\ndon't notice that transition you always\nsee with perfect clarity another\nterrific thing about Roka eyeglasses and\nsunglasses is that many of the\nperformance glasses out there that are\ndesigned for sport make people look like\ncyborgs which if you want that they do\nhave those options the cyborg options as\nI call them but they also have many\noptions where the aesthetic is more of\nthe sort that you would wear to dinner\nor to work or anywhere that you

talk\nabout dopamine what is dopamine dopamine\nis what's called a neuromodulator which\nsimply refers to the fact that it's a\nchemical that modulates or changes the\nelectrical activity of other cells and\nthe cells I'm referring to are neurons\nneurons are just nerve cells so you have\na brain and a spinal cord and the\nneurons in your brain and spinal cord\nconnect to one another and they connect\nto different areas of the body including\nbasically every organ of your body and\nevery organ of your body communicates\nback to your brain and spinal cord\nthrough Direct act or indirect Pathways\nfor instance you have neurons in your\ngut that sense what sorts of nutrients\nyou've eaten or drank and then send\nneural signals electrical signals up to\nthe brain and indeed that whole process\nhappens to be modulated by dopamine\ndopamine as a neuromodulator has the\nbasic property of either ramping up\nincreasing or decreasing the activity of\nother neurons and that's done by\nadjusting things like electrical\npotentials and things of that sort that\nwe really won't go into this episode but\nthat I promise to get into in detail in\na future episode if you're interested in\nthe biochemistry and biophysics of\nneurons and things of that sort\nso we have this neuromodulator dopamine\nand we know that that neuromodulator can\nincrease or decrease the activity of\nother neurons\nso then we have to ask ourselves where\nis dopamine released in the brain and\nbody and what specific types of neurons\nis it impacting in other words what\nspecific types of functions does\ndopamine have so there are basically\nfive circuits within the brain that use\ndopamine as the primary neuromodulator\nand those five circuits engage different\nbut related functions so I'm going to go\nthrough them one by one relatively\nquickly giving you a little bit of\nnomenclature and some sense of what each\nof those circuits looks like and what it\ndoes the first circuit is the so-called\nNigro striatal pathway so in the back of\nthe brain there's an area called\nsubstantia so named because the\nneurons that are actually very dark they\nactually contain pigment you'd be able\nto see this if I were to slice up a\nbrain you'd see two dark regions in the\nback that substantia Niagara substantia\nNiagara contains neurons that are chock\na block full of dopamine but they\nrelease that dopamine in a brain\nstructure called the striatum the\nstriatum is involved in movement both\nthe initiation of movements and the\nsuppression of movements in so-called go\naction and no go suppress action\npathways topic for a future podcast the\nsecond brain circuit that uses and\nleverages dopamine to a great extent is\nthe so-called mesolimbic pathway now\nyou'll also in a moment hear about the\nmesocortical pathway so today I'm going\nto talk about these somewhat\ninterchangeably at times but where it's\nimportant for me to differentiate\nbetween them I will do that both of\nthese Pathways initiate from a set of\nneurons in the so-called ventral\ntegmental area or VTA I will use that\nacronym VTA the VTA functions in close\npartnership with a different brain\nstructure called the nucleus accumbens\nor n a i don't think I'll call it n a\ntoday I'll talk about VTA ventral\ntegmental area and I'll talk about\nnucleus accumbens for sake of today's\ndiscussion you can lump those together\nif you want\nneurons in those areas project a bunch\nof different places but in the\nmesolimbic pathway those neurons are\nprojecting to areas of the brain like\nthe hypothalamus which sits right above\nthe roof of your mouth and is\nresponsible for a lot of basic functions\nthings like maintaining your body\ntemperature for libido in the pursuit of\nsex for Hunger for the generation of\nsignals to the pituitary gland that\ncause the release of\nhormones and other things into the\nbloodstream so the connections which I\nsometimes refer to as projections from\nthe neurons in the VTA and nucleus\naccumbens to the hypothalamus are\nbasically using dopamine to modulate the\noutput of a lot of different things that\nhappen in this hypothalamus that\ncontrols a lot of we could call them\nprimitive functions but they're really\nbasic functions for survival now the\nother pathway out of the VTA and nucleus\naccumbens is to the cortex that's why\nit's called mesocortical pathway so this\nis a very different pathway out of the\nVTA and nucleus accumbens than the one I\njust described a moment ago the pathway\nI'm talking about now the mesocortical\npathway projects to the prefrontal\ncortex which is a structure that many of\nyou have perhaps heard of but even if\nyou haven't it's important to know this\nis an area that resides right behind\nyour forehead\nand that in humans compared to other\nspecies is greatly expanded in terms of\nits size and complexity of function so\nit's involved in everything from\nplanning and executing of action to\nmaking good or bad decisions depending\non context in fact one of the primary\nfunctions of prefrontal Cortex is to\nreally understand context whether or not\nfor instance you are alone in your room\nwhere certain behaviors are appropriate\nwhether or not you are at work where\nother behaviors are appropriate\nunderstanding what the context is and\ntherefore what sorts of actions need to\nbe generated and suppressed in fact a\nguest on the huberman Lab podcast and\nthis is a guess whose episode hasn't\naired yet described this beautifully\nhe's a neurosurgeon and he said the way\nto think about the prefrontal cortex is\nit's basically an area of the brain that\nsays\nor no not now to other brain regions in\norder to suppress action we know this\nbecause people that have damage to the\nprefrontal cortex\noften can't suppress their impulses okay\nso the pathway from VTA and nucleus\naccumbens to the prefrontal cortex is\nabsolutely critical for today's\ndiscussion because we are largely going\nto be discussing motivation Drive\nPursuit procrastination and all sorts of\nthings that have to do with our feelings\nabout context whether or not we want to\ndo something or not whether or not we\nfeel we should or we shouldn't whether\nor not we feel we failed the last time\nor there's a high probability of success\nthe next time prefrontal cortex does\nmany many things but when thinking about\ndopamine's role in the prefrontal cortex\nthat is when thinking about this\nmesocortical pathway we really want to\nthink about how dopamine is activating\nor changing our propensity to do certain\nthings and get us into action or prevent\nus from doing certain things and prevent\naction so basically you can think about\nthe mesocortical pathway as a circuit\nthat really governs all of the major\nchoices that you're going to make in\nlife about what to do and what not to do\ntoward your goals and away from the\nthings that you want to avoid now the\nfourth dopamine pathway in the brain is\nthe so-called tubero infundibular\npathway and this is not one we're going\nto focus on too much today this is a\npathway that relates to connections\nbetween the brain and your pituitary\ngland your pituitary gland being that\ngland that's as I mentioned a moment ago\nis also receiving input from the\nhypothalamus and is releasing a bunch of\nhormones into your bloodstream things\nlike luteinizing hormone follicle\nstimulating hormone things like\nmelanocortin hormone these are hormones\nthat are impacting everything from the\nfunction of the ovary and females to the\nfunction of the testes and males it's\ngoverning things like cortisol release\nunder stress thyroid hormone meaning\nit's regulating thyroid hormone release\nand on and on dopamine has a very\npowerful impact on the output of the\npituitary so again that's probably a\ntopic for a future episode but it's\nimportant in reviewing the different\nbrain circuits that use dopamine as a\nneuromodulator that I mentioned that one\nthen there's a fifth one and this fifth\none is not often discussed and again\nwon't be the main topic of today's\ndiscussion but for thoroughness and for\nclarity it's important that we mention\nit this is the circuit within your\nretina that is the pie crust-like lining\nof neural tissue on the back of your eye\nbecause remember your eye is actually\npart of your brain that got extruded\nfrom your brain during development you\nknow those two eyes that you see in the\nmirror and that you see in other people\nare actually two pieces of central\nnervous system and within the retina\nwhich is the neural portion of the eye\nwithin the neural retina\ndopamine is responsible for adapting to\ndifferent light conditions so that you\ncan see clearly both in the evening and\nwhen it gets darker you can still see a\nbit and in the morning when it's very\nbright you don't really have to make\nadjustments to your visual system in\norder to see clearly your visual system\ndoes it for you and one of the ways that\nit does that is through the\nneuromodulator dopamine so today we are\nnot going to discuss the retinal\ndopamine Pathways or the\ntuberinfrendibular dopamine Pathways and\nwe won't really talk so much about the\nNigro striatal pathway I'll say one more\nthing about it and then I'll leave it\nalone we are going to talk about the\nmesocortical pathway and we might touch\non the mesolimic pathway a little bit as\nwell so today we're mostly going to talk\nabout mesocortical circuitry and\nfunction and dopamine within the\nmesocortical circuit and the reason that\nwe're doing that is that today's\ndiscussion is really about motivation\nprocrastination goal setting and pursuit\nit's very important to understand that\nneither dopamine nor the mesocortical\ncircuit cares about any specific goal or\nPursuit this is a circuit that uses\ndopamine in order to pursue anything\nnow of course some people have a greater\npropensity to pursue things like work or\ngoals and Athletics or relationships or\na combination of those other people\nunfortunately have a greater propensity\nto pursue things like drugs of abuse\nwhat are drugs of abuse drugs of abuse\ntend to be drugs that increase levels of\ndopamine to the extent that other types\nof Pursuits in life that are adaptive\nfor us like work relationship School Etc\nbecome Irrelevant in fact the definition\nof addiction that I use and that I\nbelieve really matches the neurobiology\nvery well is that addiction is a\nprogressive narrowing of the things that\nbring us pleasure healthy functioning of\nthe mesocortical pathway however allows\nus to toggle or switch back and forth\nbetween different types of Pursuits of\nall the sorts that I've mentioned\nearlier so if we can understand how that\nmeans the cortical pathway works just a\nlittle bit in particular when dopamine\nis released and when it's not released\nwhat dopamine does when it's released to\nour sense of motivation and drive\nand if we can understand a little bit\nabout how our recent dopamine history\nthat is whether or not there is dopamine\nin our system already\ndictates whether or not we are going to\nfeel motivated in the next 5 10 15\nminutes hours days and weeks that is all\nvery easy to understand I promise I'll\nexplain it to you in a simple way but I\nwant you to get a circuit into your mind\nI want you to Envision that there are\nthese neurons little nerve cells in the\nVTA and nucleus accumbens those neurons\nmake dopamine they send their\nprojections that we call axons which are\nlike little wires and they can release\ndopamine into the prefrontal cortex and\nnow you already know because you learned\nit a few minutes ago that the prefrontal\ncortex then can ensure that certain\nbehaviors take place and other behaviors\ndo not take place that or quieting that\nwe talked about earlier\nwith that in mind let's now take a look\nat how dopamine is released and let's\nkeep two things in mind there are peaks\nin dopamine that is dopamine is released\ninto the frontal cortex where it has\nthese effects of activating or\nsuppressing action\nand we can think of those as peaks in\ndopamine so if I call it a spike that\nmeans an increase and then a decrease if\nI call it a peak it's an increase and\nthen a decrease there can also be\ntroughs in dopamine what do I mean by\nthat well we have Peaks and dopamine and\nthat Peak and dopamine can rise up and\nthen go back to what we call baseline or\nthere can be a trough it can go below\nBaseline so the two key things to\nunderstand about dopamine is that we\nhave dopamine Peaks that are triggered\nby certain behaviors certain compounds\ndrugs or substances food\nEtc and that we have a dopamine Baseline\nour dopamine Baseline is our reservoir\nof dopamine it's how full or empty our\ndopamine pool is and that dopamine pool\nis the pool of dopamine that we use in\norder to create those dopamine Peaks and\nwhen those Peaks come down sometimes\nthey go back to Baseline and sometimes\nthey go to lower the base slime which we\ncall the trough\nif any of this seems confusing I want\nyou just to imagine a wave pool this is\nan analogy that was given to me by one\nof our podcast guests which is Dr Kyle\nGillette who's an obesity specialist and\nworks on a number of things related to\nendocrine hormone function including\ntestosterone estrogen in both men and\nwomen you want to check out his episodes\non Hormone Health\nnow they're fascinating and actionable\nhe's a tremendous wealth of knowledge\nand he has this analogy for how dopamine\nWorks in our brain and body and that\nanalogy is this notion of a wave pool if\nyou've ever seen a wave pool it's\nbasically a concrete pool and there are\nwaves within it okay duh those waves can\nbe of different heights so they can be\nlittle Ripples and we can think of those\nas little mini Peaks or they can be big\nwaves they can be really big crashing\nwaves\nif the height of those waves and the\nfrequency of those waves is very very\nlarge so some of that water which here\nI'm using as an analogy to dopamine can\nslosh out of the wave pool and the\nBaseline drops However if those Peaks\nare small enough\nor they are seldom enough\nwell then the Baseline that is the water\nlevel in that pool stays more or less\nconstant I think this is an excellent\nanalogy for how dopamine works in the\nmesocortical pathway as it relates to\nmotivation and pursuit and all those\nsorts of things because we really need\nto think about how the Peaks and the\nBaseline relate to one another\nand this is very important the Peaks on\nthe Baseline are not independent of one\nanother they relate to one another so\nnow you have in your mind a wave pool\nand just understand that if you get a\ngreat big huge wave maybe one of them it\nwill crash out and some of that water\nwill Splash out the Baseline will go\ndown a little bit but if you get big\npeak after big peak after big peak\npretty soon you're going to empty that\npool whereas if you have smaller waves\nor less frequent big waves well then the\nBaseline will stay relatively constant\nso let's think about dopamine Peaks and\nbass lines and let's remember that for\nevery Peak there's a trough what do I\nmean by that well when you have a wave\nyou also have the bottom of the wave\nwhen you have a mountain you have the\nbottom of the mountain\nwhen we think about dopamine Peaks and\ndopamine baselines we have to include\nthat trough because that trough that is\nthe level of dopamine below Baseline\nreally dictates whether or not you are\ngoing to feel motivated to pursue\nsomething or not so I'm going to give\nyou a visual in your mind the visual in\nyour mind is an increase in dopamine\nthat's triggered by your desire for\nsomething and really could be your\ndesire for anything if you're hungry and\nyou're thinking about I really want a\nsandwich I really want to let's think\nwhat sandwich would I want right now a\nreally nice roast beef sandwich on\nsourdough with a slice of Swiss Tomatoes\nslice of pickle here I'm describing the\nsandwich that I would want so if you're\nhungry and you're thinking about that\ndopamine starts Rising this is crucially\nimportant to understand dopamine is not\njust released when we get the reward\nwhen we get the thing that we're\npursuing dopamine is released in\nanticipation of what we want\nthat increase in dopamine\nis by no happenstance no mistake\nrelates also to our propensity and\ndesire to move remember earlier I told\nyou there's a separate Circuit of\ndopamine that triggers movement and that\nwhen it's depleted is causing things\nlike deficits and movement related to\nParkinson's or other movement disorders\nwell that's not pure coincidence that's\nbecause desire and the need to move in\norder to pursue and reach goals are one\nin the same process\nso if I desire a sandwich or I desire a\ncup of coffee or I desire some water\nwhen I'm thirsty there's an increase in\ndopamine that we could call a little\nmini Peak and dopamine\nbut then here's the key thing very soon\nafter I realized my desire for something\nthat Peak that was caused by the desire\ncomes down and drops below Baseline\nbelow the level of dopamine that it was\nprior to even thinking about the\nsandwich or the coffee or the glass of\nwater\nand it's that drop below Baseline that\ntriggers my desire to go out and find\nthat sandwich that coffee that water or\nthat blank insert whatever it is that\nyou happen to desire action or substance\nof any kind or person Etc\nso that drop below Baseline is\nfundamental to the whole process and\nthat drop below Baseline was triggered\nby the preceding Peak so let's say that\nI desire a sandwich there's an increase\nin dopamine then very quickly it comes\ndown below Baseline just a little bit\nnow I'm in pursuit of the sandwich I'm\nlooking for where I can get that\nsandwich I can order it perhaps to be\ndelivered I can go out and find it\nnow is the stage in which I have to\nthink about what are the different\nstimuli that is the things in my\nenvironment that signal whether or not\nI'm likely to get that sandwich or not\nokay so for instance if I were to go to\nmy phone and order food on an app or\nwalk down the street and see the sign\nfor a deli that's a cue that I'm likely\nto relieve that drop in dopamine and get\nnot just back to Baseline but then I'll\nget a peak in dopamine and indeed that's\nwhat happens if I find that Deli I go\ninto the deli they're open they're\nmaking the sandwich that I want they\nmake my sandwich and great I get that\nsandwich and that sandwich will have\nsome degree of inherent reward to it\nsome degree of my liking it or not\nliking it so let's say I like it it's\nnot the best sandwich I've ever had but\nall I'm doing is comparing my desire for\nthat sandwich to the sandwich that I\nactually got and ate and chances are\nit's going to relieve that craving\nmeaning it will take that dopamine that\nhad fallen below Baseline up up back to\nBaseline and if I like the sandwich it's\ngoing to indeed increase that dopamine\nagain to another Peak\nnow if I love the sandwich like it's the\nmost delicious thing that I've ever\ntasted in my entire life well then I'll\nget a big peak in dopamine when I\nconsume that reward however chances are\nthat sandwiches more or less as I expect\nit to be which is pretty good I'll eat\nit and I'm fine what do I mean by fine\nwell there's a concept called reward\nprediction error reward prediction error\nsays that the dopamine that it is\nexperienced that is that's released from\nthe VTA and nucleus accumbens\nis going to be of a certain value and\nthat value is going to be compared to\nthe desire and expectation of what I\nthought I was going to get so if you\ntake what you actually got minus what\nyou expected that's reward prediction\nerror so if the sandwich is basically\nwhat I expected to get fine dopamine\ncomes down basically to a baseline level\nthat's pretty standard for me and is\nbasically the Baseline level I had\nbefore I ever thought about the sandwich\nat all\nif the sandwich completely surprises me\nand is completely amazing just an\namazing sandwich well then the level of\ndopamine that I experience when I\nconsume that sandwich is going to be\neven greater and it's going to be that\nminus what I expected so there it's a\nbigger reward prediction error in the\ndirection of higher Peak by consuming\nthe sandwich\nand then of course there's the other\npossibility which is the deli's closed\nor the sandwich they make me is lousy or\ndoesn't taste good or something happened\nin the consuming of that sandwich that\njust makes a bad experience in which\ncase if we take that reward experienced\nminus reward predicted from the initial\ncraving well then it's going to be less\nthan what I expected and therefore the\nBaseline drops below where it was prior\nto even Desiring the sandwich okay so\nall of this might seem a little bit\ncomplicated but it's all very simple\ndesire for things increases dopamine\nbut then our level of dopamine drops\nbelow Baseline and it's that drop below\nBaseline that triggers the motivation to\nbring that dopamine level back up by\ngoing and pursuing the thing that you\nwanted in the first place now of course\nas this is happening you're not\nconscious of your dopamine levels you\nexperience this as context-dependent\ncraving and pursuit because remember the\nprefrontal cortex is involved in context\nsetting and craving and pursuit because\nit relates to action and movement which\nis one of the general features of the\ndopamine system so you can start to see\nhow this is a beautifully designed\nsystem and you can also see how it's a\nperfect system for desire and pursuit of\nanything not just sandwiches as I'm\ngiving you in this somewhat trivial but\nevery day and therefore applicable\nexample so just by understanding reward\nprediction error and especially by\nunderstanding that a craving triggers a\npeak in dopamine that makes you\nmotivated but then drops your level of\ndopamine below Baseline which makes you\neven more motivated\nyou are already halfway through the\nconceptual aspect of today's podcast\nbecause if you can understand that you\nwill understand why for instance when\nyou initially want something or you\nthink you want something\nit puts you into motion but then pretty\nquickly you're starting to feel the pain\nof not having that and that is also\ncontributing to your desire to pursue\nthat thing this is a subtle effect but\nif you watch for it you'll start to see\nit or experience it within yourself your\ncraving for things is not just about\ncraving for those things per se it's\nalso a desire to relieve the pain of not\nhaving those things and if you can\ninternalize that and start to develop an\nawareness around it you will be in an\namazing position to leverage all sorts\nof aspects of the dopamine system in\norder to increase your motivation\nespecially when things get really hard\nor when you have the propensity to\nprocrastinate which is something that\nwe'll get into a little bit later in the\npodcast I'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors\nathletic greens athletic greens now\ncalled ag1 is a vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs I've been\ntaking athletic green since 2012. so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it

of vitamin D3 K2 now I'd\nlike to talk about the Dynamics of\ndopamine release with a little bit more\ndetail and this is something I've never\ncovered on any social media post or on\nany podcast either this one or as a\nguest on other podcasts because on the\nface of it it might seem a little too\ndetailed like why is he telling me all\nthis isn't it just enough to know that\nthere are Peaks and troughs and bass\nlines and dopamine well it turns out\nthat if you can understand what that\nPeak and trough are really about in\nother words what's really happening when\nwe zoom in on that Peak and trough\nyou'll be in an amazing position to\novercome procrastination and essentially\npursue any goals in an ongoing basis so\nI'm very excited to share this\ninformation with you because I do think\nthat it has tremendous actionable power\nwhat I'm about to describe relates to a\nnumber of different findings that have\nbeen made mostly over the last five to\nten years although to be quite direct\nmostly within the last five years and it\nhas to do with the fact that the peak\nand trough and Baseline that I talked\nabout a moment ago that are associated\nwith craving\nthey look like a peak followed by a\ntrough followed by a return to Baseline\nand maybe another Peak if you get the\nreward or a drop below Baseline if you\ndon't or you don't like what you got\nbut if we were to zoom in on that Peak\nand the reward in other words really\nzoom in on the whole process and start\nthinking about the circuitry that is the\nneurons in VTA and nucleus accumbens and\nhow it relates to the frontal cortex in\na bit more detail what we discover is\nnothing short of amazing\nwhat we discover is that whenever we're\npursuing something we are always looking\nfor cues as to whether or not we are on\nthe right path\nto achieve that thing and we are also\nsetting a mindset or a context within\nour brains\nas to whether or not we are confident or\npessimistic as to whether or not we're\ngoing to achieve that thing now this is\nvitally important for anyone out there\nwho finds it hard to get motivated and\nstay motivated it's also vitally\nimportant for anyone who's\npsychologically minded in any way you\ndon't have to be a psychologist but\npsychologically minded in any way and\nwonders why is it that some people are\njust so motivated and other people have\nsuch trouble with motivation why is it\nthat some people require perfect\nconditions in order to achieve things\nand other people just seem to manage to\npursue things no matter what it also\nrelates to the fact that some of us are\nvery good at achieving our goals in one\ncontext and not so much in another so\nhere's what you need to understand\nI'll stay with the example of the roast\nbeef sandwich just because we already\nhave that in mind but you can replace\nroast beef sandwich with essentially any\ngoal\nthe cue that we're going to likely\nget what we want so for instance the\nsign that there's a deli on the corner\nor that I open my phone and that there's\nan app\nthat represents a restaurant that sells\nthe particular sandwich that I like that\ncue as I mentioned before increases\ndopamine you see that like oh okay and\nsubconsciously there's already a signal\nthat's initiated by that dopamine that\nI'm on the right path\nthen as I mentioned dopamine drops below\nBaseline that's further contributing to\nmy desire to go pursue that sandwich\neither with my thumbs on my phone\nthrough the app or with my feet and\nwalking to the deli standing in line and\nso forth\nthen as I mentioned before there is a\npeak in dopamine of varying height\ndepending on how satisfying I find the\nreward to be\nwhen I actually get that sandwich get\nthat goal\nnow keep in mind there is some time\ndelay between the queue\nthe app the deli\nEtc and when I get my sandwich\nthat Gap is going to be different for\ndifferent things so in pursuing uh you\nknow four-year degree it's going to be\nfour years if the diploma is your goal\nif if it's an exam you're studying for\nit might be a week long\nand there will be many other signals in\nbetween that initial cue that hey the\nthe reward likely lies down this path in\nthis textbook in um on you know this\ndating app or at that Deli there are\nmany other cues\nthose cues come in subconsciously and\ninvolve everything from how long the\nline is at the deli to you know whether\nor not you're you know seeing the types\nof people on a dating app that you'd\nlike to see whether or not they're\nresponding to you whether or not\nsomeone's texting you back or not\nall of those cues are integrated and\nadjusting your Baseline level of\ndopamine all the time\nas you go to pursue that goal\nso what the dopamine system does is it\ndoesn't just compare the height of the\nPeak at the beginning right the I desire\nthat to the reward that you got we\ntalked about reward prediction error\nthat's the that's the\nkind of first grade version of reward\nprediction error it's also taking into\naccount all the things that happen in\nbetween and all of that is serving as a\ncue for the eventual reward and all of\nthat is funneling into what we call\nreward prediction error\nin other words the dopamine system is\nvery good at subconsciously parsing what\nare the things that happen between\nwanting and getting\nand that's part of the learning that\ndopamine achieves and indeed there are\nspecialized circuits from the VTA and\nnucleus accumbens that are involved in\njust the learning of how we achieve or\ndon't achieve specific types of rewards\nthat we desire so this is called reward\ncontingent learning because it's\nlearning the contingencies of what led\nup to a reward or what didn't lead up to\na reward\nat the same time end in parallel there's\nan ongoing release of dopamine in the\nbackground and that ongoing release of\ndopamine that has nothing to do with\nlearning is really just sort of a\npropeller that's driving us in the\ndirection of whatever it is that we're\ntrying to pursue\nso I realize for some of you this might\nseem like unnecessary or perhaps even an\noverwhelming amount of detail\nbut it's actually quite simple\nyour brain is trying to figure out what\nhappened prior to getting or not getting\na reward and it's comparing what you\nwanted compared to what you got\nat the same time the dopamine system\ninitiates a motivation signal that takes\nyou through that entire round of pursuit\nand those three things there's the\nstimulus the desire the I want that\nthat's the first thing that leads to\nthat Peak the peak drops a little bit\nbelow Baseline and it triggers\nmotivation the motivation is the second\nthing\nthe motivation is dopamine release also\nbut from a separate set of neurons\nwithin this circuit driving you forward\nand the entire time that it's driving\nyou forward\nit's paying attention to what's there\nalong the way even if you don't realize\nit consciously and then there's the\nreward itself or the lack of reward\nitself so those three components\nthe learning contingency which has to do\nwith the stimulus and the reward\nand everything that happens in between\nand the propeller nature of dopamine as\nI'm referring to it those all combine\ninto a total learning so that after you\nget the sandwich or after you finish the\nexam or after you go out on a date or\nafter you do anything that you desire to\ndo\nthat system that originates in the VTA\nand nucleus accumbens and goes up to\nyour cortex it learned it learned many\nthings it learned the contingency\nbetween stimulus and desire motivation\nand whether or not you succeeded or not\nit's basically a scoreboard for how you\ndid given what just happened\nso actually it's all very simple in fact\nif you can understand even just half of\nwhat I just said\nyou are now in a far better position to\nunderstand everything from addiction to\nmotivation to procrastination and it\nwill make sense of all the tools that\nI'm going to talk about next which will\nallow you to overcome procrastination\npoints to overcome deficits in\nmotivation and indeed to reset your\nmotivation in an ongoing way so that you\ncan reach your goals okay so let's take\neverything that I just told you and set\nit aside it's still important but let's\njust say this you don't have to think\nabout any of those details or names or\nanything\nlet's just think about addiction\nbecause in biology and in Psychology\nfrankly it really often pays to think\nabout the extremes first and then work\nour way towards more typical\ncircumstances and with that said\naddiction unfortunately is very common\nnowadays I just heard a statistic in\nfact that\nthere is an 8080 percent increase in\nalcohol use disorder among women in the\nlast 30 years I talked a little bit\nabout this in the episode that I did\nabout alcohol and health\nagain I want to be very clear I'm not\nsomebody that is completely against\nalcohol for adults provided they're not\nalcoholics\nturns out two drinks a week probably\nfine health-wise zero would be better if\nwe're honest zero is better than any\nalcohol but two drinks a week is\nprobably fine past two drinks you start\nrunning into problems and yet many many\npeople out there male and female alike\nsuffer from alcohol use disorder also\ncalled alcoholism\nthe same is also true for things like\nmethamphetamine or cocaine or other\ntypes of substance addictions\nand the same is also true for a lot of\nBehavioral or what are sometimes called\nprocess addictions things like sex\naddiction or video game addiction or any\ntype of behavior that frankly is\nleveraging the dopamine system but that\nengages this Progressive narrowing of\nthe things that bring someone pleasure\nsuch that nothing else is really Salient\nnothing else is really pulling them in\nin the way that they're video games or\nsex or pornography or alcohol\npick your substance or\nyou know behavior that you see out there\nor hopefully not but that you might\nsuffer from an addiction too so what's\nhappening in addiction\nwell addiction involves dopamine among\nother things often the opioid system Etc\nbut if we were to think about what's the\nstimulus in an addiction and what's the\npeak in dopamine and then what happens\nafter that Peak It all becomes very\nclear as to why addiction happens and\nwhy it's so pernicious\nso for instance let's take cocaine\ncocaine causes dramatic increases in\ndopamine very very fast so if somebody\ncraves cocaine\nwhat are they craving they're craving\nthat dopamine Peak they're craving the\nincreased level of alertness they're\ncraving a number of things associated\nwith the feeling of being under the\ninfluence of the drug but the stimulus\nfor it simply becomes that line of\ncocaine or in the case of crack that\ncrack rock that they're going to smoke\nand God forbid they're mainlining it you\nknow they're shooting into a vein what\nhappens is they snort smoke or inject\ncocaine and dopamine levels almost\nimmediately\ngo up up up up up up to a very high peak\nokay so the the time gap between the\nstimulus and the dopamine is very very\nshort\nso short in fact that there's really no\nother contingencies in between that the\nmesocortical system has to learn in fact\nwhat is the system quote unquote learn\nit learns\ncocaine equals massive amounts of\ndopamine equals feeling euphoric and\nenergetic Etc\nand in doing that\nit reinforces the whole circuit so that\nthat short we can even say hyper short\ncontingency is really what the system\nwants\nso much so that longer contingencies of\nsay putting in the hard work of you know\ngenerating a fitness program or a\nprofessional program for yourself or a\neducation program which takes not just\nmany days but many weeks and years well\nnone of that is going to lead to peace\nin dopamine that are as high as the\nPekin dopamine associated with cocaine\nso that tells us something critical\nit is both the duration between desire\nend effect and when I say effect I mean\nthe rewarding properties of dopamine\nthat are experienced that's important so\nvery short gaps\nteach the system to expect and want\nshort gaps\nmakes it very hard to pursue things that\ntake longer\nso when we say it's the short or in this\ncase hyper short distance or time\nbetween the stimulus and the dopamine\nwhat we're really talking about if we\nwere to plot this out on a on a board or\non a piece of paper is the steepness of\nthe rise of that Peak it's very very\nsteep the peak in dopamine is coming up\nvery fast after the desire\nand in addition to that and this is very\nimportant the higher the peak in\ndopamine and the faster the rise to that\nPeak the further below Baseline the\ndopamine drops after the drug wears off\nokay so in the case of cocaine it's a\nvery fast and very large rise in\ndopamine followed by a steep drop\nand very deep trough in dopamine below\nBaseline\nyou say okay so there's pleasure then\nthere's lack of pleasure ah but it's\nworse than that because it's not just\nlack of pleasure if you recall what we\ntalked about a little bit earlier that\ndrop below Baseline triggers\nthe desire and the pursuit for what for\nmore\nand so this sets in motion a vicious\nLoop where people start pursuing peaks\nin dopamine that can come very fast\nwithout much effort\nand that's one of the ways in which\naddictions start to take hold\nthere's a simple way to think about this\nand to remember if you want to avoid\nthis whole thing I mean the first one is\nobvious don't do cocaine don't try it\ndon't use it certainly don't get\naddicted to it\nthose are all sort of one in the same\nfrankly I don't know many people that\ndespite\nopinions to the contrary that use\ncocaine recreationally that don't at\nsome point run into either a financial\npsychological physical or some other\nproblem the other thing that's\nabsolutely critical to keep in mind and\nthis was discussed in my colleague Dr\nAnna lemke's book dopamine nation and on\nthis podcast excellent book by the way I\nhighly recommend it if you haven't read\nit already it's a fascinating\nexploration into dopamine as it relates\nto addiction not just drug addiction but\nother types of addiction again the name\nof that book is dopamine Nation we'll\nprovide a link to it in the show note\ncaptions\nthe other thing that happens after those\nbig fast increases in dopamine caused by\nthings like cocaine is\nafterwards when it quickly drops below\nBaseline\nit takes a much longer time to get back\nto the original Baseline than it did\nprior to using the drug\nand worse still is that the peaks in\ndopamine that are created from more\nconsumption of cocaine leads to\nprogressively lower Peaks\nand deeper troughs below Baseline so the\nwhole system is Shifting away from\npleasure and more to pain and the desire\nfor pursuit of the drug\nnow\nthis is a terrible situation and it's a\nterrible situation that's not just\nunique to cocaine in fact if we were to\nlook at the averages and again these are\naverages of the height of the peaks in\ndopamine that are created by different\nsubstances and the rates at which those\nPeaks take place because remember the\ntime to Peak is just as important as how\nhigh that Peak goes\nwe see some pretty interesting numbers\nso for instance and again these are\naverages based on neuroimaging combined\nwith\num what are called pet scans positron\nemission tomography combined with blood\ndraws and a number of other data from\nboth animal and human studies\nyou find is that at Baseline just kind\nof on a background of no drug taking of\nany kind the neurons in the Venture\npigmental nucleus accumbens area are\nfiring at a rate of about three to four\nper second releasing dopamine so that's\nyour Baseline of dopamine release your\nyour forebrain is always seeing a little\nbit of dopamine from from that system\nif you were then to anticipate food and\nyou're relatively hungry\nthat would double okay so this probably\nhappened when you decide to eat lunch\ntoday if you were hungry prior to eating\nlunch\nit doubles in the anticipation of the\nfood and then depending on how much you\nenjoyed that food it might triple or\nquadruple it might be lower than it was\nduring the anticipation as we talked\nabout before\nso there's an approximate doubling under\nconditions of Desiring and consuming\nfood\nlet's take nicotine as the next example\nfor people that use nicotine either\nsmoking vaping snuffing or dipping\nall routes of nicotine Administration\nthat I covered in our episode about\nnicotine\nthere's about a 150 percent increase in\nthe rate of dopamine neuron firing\ncocaine is going to increase the rate of\ndopamine output into the prefrontal\ncortex by about a thousand percent okay\nso what you're really talking about here\nis a tenfold increase\nin the amount of of dopamine that's\nreleased into the prefrontal cortex as\nmeasured by the rates of firing of these\ndopamine neurons\nmethamphetamine is going to be anywhere\nfrom a thousand percent anywhere up to\nten thousand percent it really varies\ndepending on the potency of the drug and\na few other factors and here's where\nperhaps it gets a little more\ninteresting some of you are probably\nwondering about caffeine or about sex or\nabout video games now they're the\nnumbers vary tremendously and it's\nreally important to understand that\nacross the board not just for caffeine\nsex video games but also for nicotine\nalcohol and other substances and what we\ncall motivated behaviors some of which\nare part of a healthy life like eating\nand reproduction you know provided it's\nyou know age-appropriate context\nappropriate you know species appropriate\nconsensual well then we consider it\nadaptive if it's not well then\nconsidered maladaptive\nsome people will sit down to play a\nvideo game they really like video games\nand as they're sitting down they will\nexperience a five-fold increase in the\nrate of dopamine output from their\nnucleus accumbens for other people it's\ngoing to be a tenfold increase for other\npeople like me who don't like video\ngames very much I don't have anything\nagainst them I don't dislike them but it\ndoesn't do much for me\nit might not cause any increase\nwhatsoever it might even cause a\ndecrease in dopamine so there's a lot of\nindividual variability for sex it turns\nout to be a range so the typical range\nthat's cited in the literature is\nanywhere from a four to five-fold\nincrease in the rate of dopamine neuron\nfiring however there are certain\nindividuals for which that number is\ndoubled caffeine is a little bit of a\nspecial circumstance because caffeine\nhas the property of not just causing the\nrelease of dopamine but increasing the\namount of dopamine receptors over time\nand there aren't a lot of excellent\nmeasurements of the amount of dopamine\nreleased as a function of caffeine\nintake in different populations of\nhumans it's mostly animal studies but\nwhat we think based on the Gestalt based\non the overall picture of the literature\nis that it's an approximate doubling of\nthe dopamine signaling that's coming out\nof the VTA nucleus accumens to\nprefrontal Cortex when we anticipate and\nwhen we drink our coffee\nagain I really want to be clear that for\nall of these things these are relative\nlevels and they are distribution so if\nwe were to plot them out on paper you\nwould see that these are not bar graphs\nthese are overlapping curves to some\nextent so some people are going to\nachieve more dopamine release or less\ndopamine release from one Behavior or\nsubstance however it's very clear that\ncocaine methamphetamine\neven heroin for that matter are way out\non the right hand side of the curve\ncausing enormous increases in dopamine\nvery quickly and the other things that\nwe described have again a distribution\nthat is more leftward shifted on this\nimaginary plot that I'm creating\nit's a lot of individual variability\nhowever it's fascinating that dopamine\nis the single molecule that's causing\nthe craving and pursuit and experience\nof all of these substances and behaviors\nand the learning of all of that craving\nPursuit and actual experience is what\npredicts whether or not we will\nre-engage reuse that substance or not\nre-engage in a behavior or not and how\nfrequently we will do that so that's\naddiction but if you understand how the\nheight of those peaks in dopamine and\nthe rate to reach those Peaks and the\ntroughs that result and how long the\ntroughs take to get back to Baseline if\nyou understand or a little or all of\nthat\nyou're really in a terrific position to\nunderstand how to Leverage The dopamine\nsystem for the pursuit of healthy goals\nand behaviors I should mention one thing\nabout recovery from addiction which is\nthat the reset of all that dopamine\ncircuitry from unhealthy to healthy\noften involves depending on the\naddiction 30 days of complete abstinence\nthat 30 days of complete abstinence\ninevitably involves a lot of pain and\ndiscomfort and craving anxiety insomnia\nEtc that relates to the big trough in\ndopamine that inevitably occurs now of\ncourse there are some addictions such as\nsevere alcohol addiction and in some\ncases opiate addiction that immediate\nand sustained abstinence cannot be used\nas the tool somebody really needs to\nwork with an addiction specialist and\nsometimes there needs to be a tapering\noff of the substance for other\naddictions it can be quote unquote cold\nturkey and then of course there are\nother addictions particularly food and\nsex but sometimes even things like video\ngames for which the desired outcome is\nnot necessarily to eliminate the\nbehavior completely but to set some\nconstraints around the behavior so that\nit's not occurring to the exclusion of\nother pleasureful things in life and\nadaptive things in life and for that\nthere is the requirement for what are\ncalled binding behaviors we'll get back\nto binding behaviors later but binding\nbehaviors or behaviors in which people\nbind their behavior\naround a particular substance use or\naround a particular behavioral addiction\nlike sex Video Games Etc in space and or\ntime in space meaning they might only\nengage in those particular behaviors in\ncertain places and certain times when\nit's context appropriate there are\nnumerous examples of binding behaviors\nin space and time it all has to do with\nclamping or directing when the\nengagement with the dopamine releasing\nbehavior is going to occur so what's\nhappening when people decide to go cold\nturkey or they use these binding\nbehaviors well what's happening is that\npeople are engaging the specific\ncircuitry within the prefrontal cortex\nthat as I mentioned at the beginning of\nthe episode are important for context\nsetting so in the cases of binding\nbehaviors the prefrontal cortex is\nessentially getting trained up to\nunderstand that okay certain things like\nfood or perhaps sex or perhaps video\ngames\nthey're okay if they are done or\nconsumed in\nappropriate amounts or in particular\ncontext that requires the context\nsetting goal directed behavior that the\nprefrontal cortex is responsible okay so\nfor the last 10 or 15 minutes we've been\ntalking a lot about addiction and\nactually this is not an episode about\naddiction however if you understand a\nlittle bit about the dopamine Dynamics\nin an addiction you can leverage that\nknowledge towards healthy adaptive goal\nPursuit and achieving your goals so\nlet's think about that in the context of\nwhat generates dopamine Peaks what\ngenerates desire to pursue goals what\ncauses our readout of whether or not we\nachieved a goal or not in other words\nwhat allows us to learn how to pursue\ngoals of different kinds not just get\ngood at achieving one kind of goal but\nreally understand and get really really\ngood at setting goals and pursuing goals\nof different kinds that are adaptive in\ndifferent areas of life because we all\nare going to have to pursue goals in\nschool work relationships Fitness mental\nhealth and on and on in order to be our\nbest selves that's clear\nwell all of that is possible using the\nsame basic set of dopamine circuits and\nthe same basic dynamics of dopamine so\nfor instance if we are going to feel\nmotivated at all that is if we are going\nto wake up in the morning or have any\nperiod of time during our day in which\nwe feel like we are capable of pursuing\ngoals\nwe are going to have to have a healthy\nlevel of Baseline dopamine in other\nwords we are going to have to have\nenough dopamine in the wave pool enough\nwater in the wave pool that is\nbefore we can generate any waves or\npeaks in dopamine let alone troughs and\nthe rest so how do we achieve a healthy\nBaseline level of dopamine well there we\ncan really look to some foundational\npractices practices that perhaps you've\nheard about on this podcast before and\nthat to some of you might seem a little\nmundane although some of them are a bit\nmore sophisticated maybe even esoteric\nthe good news is that we can all control\nthese things and they don't require\npurchasing anything but they do require\nsome degree of regular upkeep and effort\nthose things include what I call the\nvery Basics now the very Basics put in\nthe context of today's discussion are\nthe things that put water in the wave\npool those are going to be getting\nsufficient amounts of quality sleep each\nnight something that we've done several\nepisodes on and then have online\ntoolkits for us you can see the master\nyour sleep episode the perfect your\nsleep episode the light and health\nepisode if you want to skip all that and\njust get right to the tools we have a\nsleep tool kit or it's actually called\nthe toolkit for sleep that you can\naccess at hubermanlab.com completely\nzero cost you just go there and download\nthat toolkit getting sufficient sleep\neach night literally restores your\ndopamine reserves it allows dopamine to\nbe present and for you to have a level\nof Baseline dopamine that will allow you\nto even consider your goals in any kind\nof meaningful or reasonable way\nsecond there are practices that are\nsupported by the scientific literature\nto increase your Baseline level of\ndopamine that are independent of sleep\nbut are similar to sleep and I like to\nrefer to these as non-sleep deep rest\nthis is not meditation there's actually\nvery little evidence that meditation of\nthe traditional kind of you know sitting\neyes closed third eye sent focusing on\nyour third eye center which is this area\nbehind your forehead there is very\nlittle evidence that that increases\nlevels of dopamine there is a place for\nmeditation in the context of today's\ndiscussion but I'll repeat\nmeditation itself is a focusing exercise\nit is not known to increase dopamine\nhowever non-sleep deep breaths so-called\nnsdr very similar although different to\nwhat's sometimes called Yoga Nidra which\nis where you lie there you do a sort of\nbody scan some long exhale breathing and\nSDR is very similar you can find a link\nto a zero cost nsdr on YouTube it's a 10\nminute long one there are also 20 and 30\nminute ones out there also on YouTube\nbut I'll provide a link to the 10 minute\none\nthose have been shown to increase the\namount of dopamine in your dopamine\nReserves\nby up to 65 percent which is a\nremarkable number so quality sleep\nnon-sleep deep breast AKA Yoga Nidra\nvery powerful ways to keep your Baseline\nlevel of dopamine at a sufficient level\nin addition to that nutrition no doubt\nplays a role in your Baseline level of\ndopamine because tyrosine the amino acid\nis the rate limiting enzyme For the\nsynthesis of dopamine\ntyrosine is present in varying levels in\ndifferent foods you can look those up\nonline you just simply put in a search\nfor tyrosine levels in different foods\neverything from particular cheeses like\nparmesan cheese has high levels of\ntyrosine certain meat certain nuts\ncertain vegetables without getting into\ndetails in specifics you can find those\nthere but you need proper nutrition and\ntherefore nutrients in particular\ntyrosine in order to have\nsufficient levels of Baseline dopamine\nthe third thing on the list and again\nthese are things that we come back to\nalmost every episode but I don't think\nthey can be repeated enough because\nthese are really things that we need to\nfocus on every 24 hours you might be\nable to skip a day here or there if you\nget sick or you're traveling or you have\nsome major life event but really every\n24 hours we need to re-up our sleep we\nneed to re-up our nutrients\neven if you're fasting you're re-upping\nyour nutrients from stored sources\nwithin your body\nthe third thing is sunlight morning\nsunlight in particular I've done\nextensive episodes about this check out\nthe episode on lighting your health if\nyou want all the details but you want to\ntry and view sunlight as early in the\nday as possible\nfive to ten minutes on a clear day\nminimum 10 to 20 minutes on a cloudy day\nminimum\n20 or 30 minutes on a very overcast day\nminimum without sunglasses don't stare\nat the sun please don't damage your eyes\nlook off slightly off from the Sun but\nyes you want to face the Eastward\ntowards the Sun and on those cloudy days\nthat's especially important to do why\nwell viewing morning sunlight increases\ncortisol early in the day which is\nexcellent because you want cortisol\nelevated early in the day and you want\nit lower later in the day and because of\nthe relationship between the cells in\nyour eye that sense sunlight\nspecifically morning sunlight believe it\nor not that happens and signal to your\nhypothalamus and the relationship\nbetween the hypothalamus and the\npituitary and other endocrine organs\nit sets in motion a dopamine-related\nCascade in\nneuromodulators dopamine and hormones\nthat lead to states of well-being\nelevated mood alertness Etc throughout\nthe day it also helps your sleep at\nnight but today we're talking about\ndopamine so yes believe it or not that\nmorning sunlight exposure does increase\nyour levels of dopamine not just\ncortisol\nand fourth on the list is going to be\nmovement exercise of varying kinds be\nresistance training could be\ncardiovascular training that does\nincrease levels of dopamine here we're\nnot talking about achieving peaks in\ndopamine right that could be\naccomplished through setting a personal\nrecord a PR or through Sprints or heavy\nlifts or learning some new Dynamic\nmovement what we're really talking about\nhere is getting into a regular exercise\nprogram of if not every day at least\nfive days a week a mixture of\ncardiovascular and resistance exercise\nthat we also know is known to elevate\nand maintain an elevated level of\nBaseline dopamine so it's not just about\nthe Euphoria you feel during or after\nexercise it's also about the Baseline\nlevel of dopamine that's achieved\nthrough regular movement and engaging in\nmovement and if you're asking how could\nthat be well you already know the answer\nthe circuits in the brain and body that\ngenerate movement not just goal seeking\nbut movement itself as I mentioned\nearlier that Niagara striatal pathway\nand yes that circuit is separate from\nthe VTA nucleus accumbens to cortical\ncircuit the mesocortical circuit that\nwe've mainly been focusing on today but\nthey interact and so by engaging in\nregular movement you ensure that you're\nmaintaining elevated levels of Baseline\ndopamine which is what you want if\nyou're going to be able to engage in any\nkind of motivated Pursuit behavior of\nany kind so those are the fundamentals\nthat will set the level of Baseline\ndopamine in your system\na couple of key points yes there is\nvariation based on both genetics and\nCircumstance in Baseline levels of\ndopamine if someone's going through a\nparticular hard time or if somebody\ninherited a gene in the dopamine\nsynthesis pathway that simply affords\nthem higher levels of Baseline dopamine\nwe likely know these people they seem\nhyper motivated all the time not just\nbased on prior success\nbut they just seem to have a lot of\nenergy and a lot of go drive you know\nyou talk about activation energy some of\nyou may know what that term means others\nof you won't having low activation\nenergy is great I mean the amount of\nenergy that it takes to get into action\nto pursue adaptive and meaningful\nhealthy goals some people just seem to\nhave lower activation energy and higher\nlevels of dopamine are probably\nassociated with that some of us have\nlower levels of Baseline dopamine\nregardless everyone needs to engage in\nthe foundational things that I just\nmentioned a few moments ago every 24\nhours or at least strive to there is no\nescaping that I'd like to just take a\nbrief moment and thank one of our\npodcast sponsors which is inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that blood\nwork is the only way that you can\nmonitor the markers such as hormone\nmarkers lipids metabolic factors Etc the\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nhealth one major challenge with blood\nwork however is that most of the time it\ndoes not come back with any information\nabout what to do in order to move the\nvalues for hormones metabolic factors\nlipids Etc into the ranges that you want\nwith inside tracker changing those\nvalues becomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized dashboard\nthat you can use to address the\nnutrition-based behavior-based\nsupplement-based approaches that you can\nuse in order to move those values into\nthe ranges that are optimal for you Your\nvitality and your longevity inside\ntracker now includes a measurement of\nAPO lipoprotein B so-called APO B in\ntheir ultimate plan apob is a key marker\nof cardiovascular health and therefore\nthere's extreme value to knowing your\napob levels if you'd like to try inside\ntracker you can go to insidetracker.com\nhuberman to get 20 off any of inside\ntracker's plans again that's inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off now\nthere are things that can increase one's\nBaseline level of dopa being further\nand some of those get us into the realm\nof supplements and prescription drugs\nbut for now I just want to mention a few\nof them that are purely behavioral in\nnature are zero cost and that have been\nshown in the research literature to\nincrease Baseline levels of dopamine for\nlong periods of time and this is\nimportant because if any of you are out\nthere listening to this thing about\nPeaks and troughs and bass lines you\nmight be asking wait what's the\ndifference between a Baseline and a peak\nreally because if for instance you get a\nbig peak well that's a peak in the\nBaseline so how do you distinguish\nbetween Peak and Baseline and well\nthere's a trough and let's say that\ntrough lasts an hour is that hour-long\ntrough for your baseline or you know\nwhere's your set point how do you\nestablish your set point or more\nimportantly how do you raise your set\npoint ah well if you're not already\nasking that question I just asked it for\nyou I Define an increase in your\nBaseline level in dopamine to be\nanything that increases dopamine for\nmore than one hour you know when we\nthink about cocaine and amphetamine\npornography sex caffeine things of that\nsort regardless of how long one engages\nin about of those behaviors or\nsubstances\nthe increases in dopamine are going to\nbe relatively short-lived on the order\nof minutes to an hour sometimes longer\nnow I didn't say that's how long you're\nengaging in the behaviors I said that's\nhow long those increases in dopamine are\ngoing to occur even if you were to\ncontinually engage in those behaviors\nand remember with continual engagement\nin a dopamine spiking Behavior\na behavior that increases dopamine Peaks\nthe height of those Peaks remember gets\nlower and lower and lower especially in\na short amount of time and then drops\nbelow Baseline\nthere are tools and techniques that you\ncan use to elevate your Baseline level\nof dopamine for long periods of time and\nhere again this is done in addition to\nthe basic tools that I mentioned a few\nmoments ago the simplest one for which\nthere are excellent data and here I'm\nreferring to data published in the\nEuropean Journal physiology I'll provide\na link to this is that\nexposure of your body up to the neck to\ncold water and it doesn't have to be\nsuper cold by the way to cold water has\nbeen shown to increase Baseline levels\nof dopamine and the other so-called\ncatecholamines which include\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine but\nfor sake of today's discussion dopamine\nin particular\nfor not just one but at least two and\nprobably as long as four or five hours\nthere have been some additional\nscientific studies after the paper I\njust mentioned\nand it's really remarkable you can\naccomplish this a number of different\nways you could get into a cold shower in\nthe morning and I do recommend doing\nthis in the morning and in that case\nit's okay to get the water on your head\nin fact I recommend it uh you could get\ninto an ice bath you could get into a\ncold Plunge in these circumstances I'm\nnot suggesting this for sake of\nincreasing metabolism or fat loss and\nthe whole discussion around uh\ndeliberate cold and metabolism and fat\nloss has become a little bit\ncontroversial so we won't go there now\nmostly because we're focused on the\nclear ability of deliberate cold\nexposure to increase dopamine for long\nperiods of time AKA your dopamine\nBaseline\nthe ways to do this vary depending on\nthe temperature so for instance\nthere are data pointing to the fact that\nif you want to get a long lasting\nincrease in your Baseline dopamine you\ncould take a very cold shower or cold\nplunge or ice bath\nfor a very brief period of time anywhere\nfrom 30 seconds to two minutes maybe\nthree minutes but probably 30 seconds to\ntwo minutes now you might ask what is\nvery cold you have to be careful because\nI don't want to recommend anything\nthat's going to cause anyone to have a\nheart attack or go into shock or\nanything of that sort\nit's going to vary by person depending\non your level of cold tolerance what I\nrecommend is if you are going for the\nshort exposure long dopamine release\napproach that is 30 seconds to two\nminutes that you start warmer than you\nthink you need to and then you ease into\nit over a few days\nbut we're really talking about ranges in\ntemperature from anywhere from about 37\ndegrees Fahrenheit to about 55 degrees\nFahrenheit again be careful approach it\nwith caution and ease into it I do\nrecommend doing this early in the day\nand I should mention not after strength\nor hypertrophy training because within\nthe six hours after strength or\nhypertrophy training this deliberate\ncold exposure especially immersion up to\nthe neck can suppress the strength and\nhypertrophy adaptation that the training\nis designed to accomplish okay so that's\none approach the other approach that's\nsupported by the literature to increase\nBaseline levels of dopamine for very\nlong periods of time in fact this is the\noriginal approach is to get into warmer\nwater so not warm but warmer so 60\ndegree Fahrenheit water\nup to the neck and to stay there for\nabout 45 to 60 Minutes the reason I\ndon't think most people will do that or\nthat most people would prefer a shorter\ncolder exposure protocol is that most\npeople don't have 45 to 60 minutes each\nmorning to get into water and sit there\nand in that study they actually had them\nsitting in lawn chairs basically in the\nshallow end of a pool up to their neck\nfor a full 60 minutes and then measuring\ndopamine release and so forth so there\nare a bunch of different ways to do this\nI should emphasize I don't think you\nneed to be super precise about the\ntemperature and even the duration what I\nrecommend is\nfind a temperature that's uncomfortably\ncold to you meaning that you feel\nagitated you want to get out but that\nyou're confident you can safely stay in\nand again I can't give a simple\nprescriptive to everybody but this is\nknown to increase Baseline levels of\ndopamine significantly in fact double\nthem or more for long periods of time\nmeaning hours up to four maybe even six\nhours into the day which is one of the\nreasons I suggest doing this early in\nthe day\nI happen to get into a cold plunger take\na cold shower first thing in the morning\nI do go outside and get my sunlight\nfirst sometimes sometimes I do the cold\nfirst it really depends on my\ncircumstances and how I'm feeling that\nday I don't think it really matters\nwhich one you do first but you want to\ntry and get both of those in early in\nthe day because you really want the\ncatecholamines and cortisol elevated\nearly in the day okay so that's\ndeliberate cold exposure we already\ntalked about exercise so if you're doing\nyour exercise early in the day there's\nno reason why it couldn't be done in\nconcert with this deliberate cold\nexposure I recommend doing the\ndeliberate cold exposure first for the\nreasons we talked about a few minutes\nago and then of course there are\ncompounds both prescription and\nover-the-counter compounds that can\nindeed raise your Baseline levels of\ndopamine for an hour or more and when I\nsay an hour or more it really depends on\nindividual variation in terms of how\nquickly you metabolize dopamine and it\ndepends on individual variation in how\nyou manage or tolerate different dosages\nof drugs and different types of drugs so\nthe typical drugs and here I'm talking\nabout legal\nprescription drugs for increasing\ndopamine are things like Ritalin\nAdderall modafinil and arm modafinil\nalso tap into the system and I did an\nentire episode about ADHD which is the\ntypical context in which you hear about\nthese prescription drugs but assuming\nit's prescribed by a doctor for either\nclinical reasons like ADHD or for other\nreasons all of those compounds do\nsignificantly increase Baseline levels\nof dopamine for many many hours that's\nabsolutely clear and it's one of the\nmajor reasons why those drugs are so\neffective in increasing motivation and\nattention then there are compounds that\nare sold over the counter things like\namino acids such as l-tyrosine itself\nthat's a very commonly sold and used\namino acid it's present in a lot of\nso-called pre-workout formulas I as many\nof you know am a fan of single\ningredient supplements for the most part\naside from foundational supplements like\nag1 which give you many many\nmicronutrients kind of all together\nbecause it would be nearly impossible to\nconsume each of those as individual\ningredients and get the right amounts\nEtc but for all other supplements I'm a\nbig believer in parsing what you need\nand what's most effective for you in\nsingle ingredient formulations and the\ntypical ways in which people\nwork to elevate their Baseline levels of\ndopamine\nwith supplements are using either\nl-tyrosine which as I mentioned earlier\nis the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine\nor by using what's called mucuna purines\nwhich is actually very similar to l-dopa\nwhich is the treatment for Parkinson's\nmechuna purines actually comes from the\nvelvety outside coating of a certain\nbean I know it sounds really esoteric\nbut that's actually where it's found in\nnature and it's really 99 l-dopa and I\nconfess having tried McCune appearance\nhaving examined the scientific\nliterature on the cune appearance there\nis some evidence that it can increase\ndopamine especially in that\ntuberinfrendibular pathway because it\ncan tap into some of the hormone-related\nfunctions of the pituitary it does\nincrease alertness and mood it might\neven increase libido motivation Etc but\nthe effects of mercuna purines tend to\nbe very much of the increasing the peak\nin dopamine and then very quickly\ndropping that peak in other words the\npeak trough phenomenon not for\nincreasing Baseline levels of dopamine\nnow it's likely different for people\nwith Parkinson's who are taking\nprescription drugs that are similar to\nmercuna purine so if people have\nParkinson's oftentimes they are\nprescribed things like l-dopa which is\nin the pathway to dopamine synthesis or\nthey are prescribed things like\nbromocriptine which will indeed increase\ndopamine and I do realize that some\npeople use those prescription drugs\nrecreationally which I don't recommend\nthose drugs can be used to increase\nBaseline levels of dopamine but more\ntypically they cause Peaks and dopamine\nand troughs and dopamine which is why I\ndo not recommend them they are not going\nto allow you to accomplish what you want\nif your goal is more motivation Etc\nin fact they are likely to do the\nopposite give you a big peak an\nalertness and then a crash that can\ninclude depressive symptoms and just not\nfeeling very good\nl-tyrosine however has been examined in\nthe scientific literature and at\nreasonably low dosages has been shown to\nincrease circulating and available\nlevels of dopamine both in the brain and\nbody and lead to increased cognitive\nperformance and in some cases physical\noutput I'll provide links to a few of\nthese studies but the two that I really\nparsed most finely for sake of this\nepisode really just focus on taking\nl-tyrosine under conditions where your\nBaseline levels of dopamine are reduced\ndue to stress and under conditions where\nthere's no stress and people are trying\nto increase their Baseline levels of\ndopamine for sake of improving cognitive\nfunction the first paper is entitled\neffective tyrosine on cognitive function\nand blood pressure under stress I'll\nprovide a link to this in the show note\ncaptions and it's one of many papers\nreally\ndating back to the early 90s exploring\nhow\nrelatively High frankly relatively High\ndosages of l-tyrosine Taken under\nconditions of stress allow people to\nrescue some of their cognitive function\nin terms of working memory tasks and\nother kind of cognitive tasks visual\nPursuit tasks and so on\nthe second paper is entitled tyrosine\nimproves working memory in a\nmultitasking environment and the second\npaper is perhaps more interesting\nbecause it involves exploring the use of\ntyrosine supplementation basically\ntaking tyrosine about an hour before a\ncognitive task or set of cognitive tasks\nthat involve a lot of multitasking and\nworking memory working memory for those\nof you that don't know is your ability\nto maintain small batches of information\nin your mind for relatively short\nperiods of time so for instance if I\ntell you my phone number or the phone\nnumber where I grew up 493-2931\nif you can remember that chances are\nyou'll remember it for 30 seconds 60\nseconds but that you won't remember it\ntomorrow because there's really no\nreason to a lot of the tasks that we do\nthroughout the day involve working\nmemory and working memory is very\nsubject to interference from other tasks\nthat we happen to be doing like looking\nat our phone or having a conversation or\ntrying to navigate through a city\nit involves a lot of attention and this\nstudy shows that tyrosine improves\nworking memory especially in the context\nof multitasking and having a lot of\nconflicting goals and they did a number\nof really nice experiments here it's\nagain it's a small study not that many\nsubjects but it's one of several papers\nin fact this is the paper that kind of\nset in motion the Domino of other papers\nexploring the efficacy of l-tyrosine for\ncognitive performance and they looked at\nworking memory tasks of course but also\nauditory visual tasks and they involve\nsome interference of visual cues and\nthings of that sort and they saw some\nreally interesting effects basically\nwhen we need to attend to multiple\nthings at the same time l-tyrosine can\nhelp us do that at least as it relates\nto memory when I say althyrosine what I\nreally mean is having your Baseline\nlevels of dopamine elevated can really\nhelp navigate multitasking environments\nespecially as it relates to working\nmemory and this is true under conditions\nof stress and under conditions of not\nstressful okay you might say well isn't\nmultitasking stressful itself yes it can\nbe but when we talk about under\nconditions of stress we're talking about\npeople who are sleep deprived we're\ntalking about people that are under\nother kinds of psychological or physical\nstress l-tyrosine can help in that\ncontext as well so as I mentioned before\nin these studies they use very high\ndosages of l-tyrosine so high that\nactually I don't recommend them they did\nmeasure stress hormones they did measure\nblood pressure and things of that sort\nbut I want to caution you I do not\nrecommend I will say it again I do not\nrecommend following the dosages that\nwere used in these two studies\nbecause they are exceedingly high they\nused 100 milligrams per kilogram of body\nweight of tyrosine one hour prior to\nthese cognitive tasks now I weigh about\n220 pounds I'm a little bit lighter than\nthat so that's a hundred kilograms\napproximately\ntranslated from this study that would\nmean that had I participated in the\nstudy and I wasn't in the placebo group\nbut I was in the l-tyrosine group I\nwould have been given 10 000 milligrams\nof l-tyrosine which is 10 grams of\nl-tyrosine I do not recommend that in\nfact there are papers showing that as\nlittle as 500 milligrams\nbut perhaps up to one gram that is a\nthousand milligrams or 1500 milligrams a\ngram and a half of l-tyrosine Taken 30\nto 60 minutes before a cognitive or\nphysical task can increase Baseline\nlevels of dopamine for extended periods\nof time and thereby improve performance\non those mental or physical tasks\nso\nif you are somebody who's interested in\ntrying l-tyrosine please know that the\nincreases in Baseline levels of dopamine\ncan be substantial they are long lasting\nwhich qualifies them as Baseline\nincreases as opposed to Peaks and I\nwould say you should also start with the\nlowest possible dose so for most people\n250 to 500 milligrams is going to be a\nreasonable starting dose depending on\nyour body weight smaller people start\nwith 250 larger maybe 500 keep an eye on\nwhether or not you're combining it with\ncaffeine or with any other stimulants\nand keep in mind that again the bigger\nthe peak in dopamine the bigger the\ntrough in dopamine afterwards so pay\nattention to whether or not you\nexperience a crash that same day or the\nnext day but chances are if you're using\na relatively low level of l-tyrosine so\nanywhere from 250 maybe 500 milligrams\nor a thousand milligrams of l-tyrosine\nprior to cognitive or physical work and\ntaken early in the day by the way\nbecause this can act as a bit of a\nstimulant that you're going to achieve\nthese long lasting increases in Baseline\ndopamine but please also keep in mind\nthat that I always always suggest that\nyou engage in the proper behaviors and\nyou disengage from the improper\nbehaviors as a first line of offense on\nany health goal so now you know how to\nset your Baseline levels of dopamine at\nthe highest possible level\nyou of course want to guard that\nBaseline level of dopamine very\ncarefully so for instance you want to\navoid any kind of behaviors or\nsubstances that are going to Peak your\nBaseline level of dopamine very high or\nvery sharply or if you do engage in\nthose types of behaviors whatever they\nmay be that you are well aware that your\nBaseline level of dopamine will drop far\nbelow what it was after that Peak has\nfallen you will be essentially in the\nquote unquote trough\nif however you find yourself in that\ntrough you now have the knowledge to\nunderstand that that trough will resolve\nif you wait enough time that Baseline\nlevel of dopamine that you were at prior\nto the peak will come back you will feel\nbetter however most people don't know\nthat and as a consequence when they feel\nthat low\nthat is they feel kind of a motivated\nmaybe a little bit depressed maybe a lot\nammotivated or a lot depressed following\nsome quote unquote Peak experience\nwhat they end up doing is thinking about\nwhat caused that Peak experience and\nthen go back and try to re-engage in the\nbehavior and try and regenerate that\nPeak experience but you now know that\nthat is a terrible strategy in fact that\nstrategy will only lead to diminished\nPeaks from the same experience it will\nlead to in many cases pursuing more and\nmore intense experiences to try and\nrecapitulate recreate that big peak\nwhich won't work or even worse people\nstart stacking and combining different\ndopamine increasing behaviors in order\nto try and obtain something like that\ninitial Peak when in fact all they need\nto do all you need to do is simply wait\nbecause the way that the dopamine\ncircuitry is arranged is that it's not\njust about pleasure as you know it's\nabout motivation desire Pursuit and\npleasure and it also has everything to\ndo with pain and discomfort\nnow when people hear the word pain they\noften think oh pain okay so a physical\npain or an intense emotional pain but\ntoday we're going to talk about pain a\nlittle bit differently we're going to\ntalk about the pain associated with the\ntrough and dopamine that occurs after a\nbig peak in dopamine\nas a period in which\npain and effort go hand in hand and I'll\nreturn to this in a moment but I want\nyou to just note that in your mind kind\nof earmark that in your mind because\nwhat we're about to talk about is how to\nleverage that pain and to use effort as\na way to not just get out of the trough\nmore quickly but actually to get back to\na higher level of Baseline as you exit\nthat trough meanwhile I really want to\nharp on this one point that I made a\nmoment ago which is that after some big\nexperience so it could be a vacation or\na night out partying or the birth of a\nnew child all of these are well-known\nphenomena that lead to troughs or\ndeficits in dopamine afterwards which\ncan cause a sort of postpartum\ndepression postpartum depression is a\nphrase normally used to describe\nliterally postpartum post-birth of a\nchild depression and that has many\ncauses not just related to dopamine\nbaselines although it does involve\ndopamine baselines but it has hormonal\naspects and other aspects as well but\npostpartum depression is also used to\ndescribe any time that our Baseline\ndopamine has has gone down way way below\nwhat it was prior to some recent Peak or\nexciting exhilarating win or behavior\ncouple of things that one can do in\norder to get out of that trough more\nquickly the first one is simply to wait\nwith the understanding that you will get\nout I know that sounds overly simplistic\nand maybe a little bit brutal but I\nthink most people don't realize this\nthey don't realize that the dopamine\ncircuitry does take time to replenish\nand it has everything to do with\nrestoring both the synthesis of dopamine\nas well as What's called the readily\nreleasable pool of dopamine so dopamine\nis packaged in these little spherical\nthings that we call vesicles those\nvesicles are released from the ends of\nnerves so in this case we're talking\nabout the nerves that originate again\nand\nVTA and nucleus accumbens and send their\nlittle wires up to the prefrontal cortex\nand that's where dopamine is released\nand that readily releasable pool of\ndopamine takes time to replenish and\nthat can take several days in order to\nreplenish just knowing that can help you\nthrough that process and of course then\nit raises the question is there anything\nthat you can do to accelerate that\nprocess and indeed there is and indeed\nthis is what I consider not just\nsomething to get you out of a trench of\nkind of lower mood and motivation but\nactually what represents the Holy Grail\nof motivation today I'm going to talk\nabout this pain effort process as a very\npowerful way to get out of sticking\npoints but more importantly to get into\na mode where effort and reward can\nactually accelerate your progress along\nany path to any goal and in a way that\nyou can do it repeatedly and this is not\nsimply taking mechanisms from biology\nand painting names on them rather this\nis leveraging mechanisms in biology that\nare well defined in the animal and human\nin literature that have parallels to the\naddiction and addiction recovery\nliterature but that have been shown in\nspecific circumstances to really allow\npeople to engage in motivational\nPursuits in a variety of context School\nrelationships work etc in an ongoing way\nand in a way that never depletes their\nBaseline of dopamine to the point where\nthey have to do a lot of extra work to\nget it back and in a way that allows\nthem to be really motivated in a variety\nof contexts in an Adaptive way so what\nwe're really talking about here is\nregardless of your genetics regardless\nof who your parents are which obviously\nyou couldn't select\nbeing able to leverage your dopamine\nsystem in order to be maximally\nmotivated when you want to be and indeed\nto avoid procrastination I'd like to\ntell you about a classic experiment that\nI've described once before on this\npodcast but frankly this experiment is\nso crucial I don't think it can be\ndescribed enough\nthis was an experiment that was done at\nStanford many years ago and involved\nchildren but it's actually been repeated\nin adults\nthe experiment involved observing a\nclassroom of young children so these\nwere kids about kindergarten age a\nlittle bit older and observing which\nactivities kids like to do in their free\ntime so their structured time where they\nhad to you know these are little kids so\nthey play blocks or they had to\num sing or they had to write or or do\nwhat they could or I suppose draw\nthey're probably not writing um\nsignificant prose at that age but then\nthey had free time where they could do\nwhatever they wanted and what the\nresearchers did was observe the children\nwho selected by their own choice to draw\npictures so there were some tables out\nwith crayons and markers and paper Etc\nand there were some kids that would just\nnaturally go to that activity every day\nbecause they liked that activity\nand they measured how much of the free\ntime these children elected to use their\nfree time drawing doing these different\nart projects\nand then what they did was they started\nintroducing rewards to these children\nthey started putting a gold star or in\nsome cases a silver star on their pieces\nof artwork and telling them what a good\njob they did and the kids really liked\nthat in fact who wouldn't right they're\nnot only doing an activity that they\nlike but they're also getting a reward\nfor it so you can probably see where\nthis is all going what they were doing\nwas they were increasing the amount of\ndopamine that these children experience\nand again in parallel experiments done\nwith adults if you take adults who enjoy\na particular activity you let them do\nactivity and then you start rewarding\nthem for that activity especially when\nyou surprise them with a reward for an\nactivity they already like\nthey report that being a much more\npleasurable experience than had they\njust done the activity\nthen what they did with these children\nand in the experiments with adults done\nlater on was they cease giving them the\nreward and then they observe what\npercentage of their free time they spend\ndoing that activity drawing and what\nthey observed was you guessed it a drop\nin the total amount of time that the\nchildren elected to do this activity\nthat initially they were doing quite a\nlot in other words\ntheir total satisfaction or desire or\nmotivation to engage in this activity\ndrop below what it was prior to ever\nreceiving a reward and again this has\nbeen repeated in a variety of contexts\nin different populations different\ncultures different countries men women\nboys girls lots of different backgrounds\nso what this tells us is everything you\nalready know which is that reward\nprediction error is not just about the\ndesire to do something and you carrying\nit out and it being pretty good\namazing or not good okay I always like\nto joke that the nervous system sort of\ncodes things into three bins you can\nthink about this in terms of food or any\ntype of experience it can either be yum\nyes I really like that yuck I really\ndon't like that or meh it's kind of so\nso\nwhat the scenario led to where rewards\nwere received for an activity that\npeople already like to do and then\nremoved was that an activity that at one\npoint was a yum becomes a meh and that\nall reflects a drop in Baseline dopamine\nwhy because the activity that the\nchildren or adults liked combined with\nthe gold star or the monetary reward or\npraise that children and adults seem to\nlike compounded to create a bigger peak\nin dopamine and therefore a bigger\ntrough in dopamine and if you're already\nwondering whether or not their desire to\nengage in that activity eventually came\nback it did indeed so essentially what I\ndescribed all matches precisely with\ndopamine reward prediction error and the\nfact that peaks in dopamine give rise to\nsubsequent troughs and dopamine that if\none Waits long enough\nallow Baseline levels of dopamine to\nreturn to normal\nand of course the amplitude of that\ndopamine Peak has been varied by giving\nmore money or less money in different\nscenarios nearly all the different\nderivations of the experiments that you\ncould imagine that map onto the Dynamics\nof dopamine release that we've been\ntalking about during this episode all\nplayed out exactly as one would have\npredicted based on the neural circuitry\nand the Dynamics of dopamine I recommend\nthat you leverage this knowledge to make\nsure that any activities that you enjoy\nto do whether or not you enjoyed a\nlittle or a lot but especially if you\nenjoy it a lot that you guard and\nProtect by making sure that you don't\nstart layering in or attaching reward or\nother sources of dopamine releasing\nbehaviors or substances to that specific\nbehavior or if you do that you don't do\nit terribly often now how often is\nterribly often we'll get to that in a\nmoment but let me give you an example\nfrom my life just as an example but you\nwill likely have and you'll know people\nthat will have different examples\nI love to exercise I know to some people\nuh this might seem foreign but I love to\nexercise I love to do resistance\ntraining I love to run I am not one of\nthose people that doesn't like the\nexperience of exercising but likes the\nfeeling afterwards quote unquote I hear\nthat a lot I don't like to exercise but\nI love the way I feel afterwards I love\nphysical training and I love the way I\nfeel afterwards but I mostly love the\nfeeling during I don't know why I'm\nwired that way I can't say that I'm\nsomebody who likes to do hard things\nacross the board there are plenty of\ndifficult things in life that I dread or\nthat I'm sort of meh about\nbut for me hard exercise intense\nexercise of a particular kind resistance\ntraining and running in particular\nboth give me a yum yes I love this kind\nof feeling and yes it persists for me\nquite a long while afterwards both for\nsake of the way that it changes my\nneurochemistry but also my sense of\nsatisfaction but I just simply love it\nnow years ago I discovered that if I\ndrink\na cup of black coffee or an Americano or\na double espresso or some yerba mate\nthat my workouts can be quite a bit more\nintense I can run further and then I\nalso discovered that if I were to take a\npre-workout energy drink or I took say\n300 milligrams of alpha GPC and 500\nmilligrams of phenylethylamine and\nperhaps even 500 milligrams of\nl-tyrosine and perhaps did that\nalongside the caffeine in the Yerba mate\nthen yes absolutely I really like those\nworkouts I could be like a laser in\nterms of focus I could exert even more\neffort put on some music and I could\nachieve even better performance and then\nI also discovered that I could\nexport that protocol of caffeine yerba\nmate and various supplements to my\ncognitive work so I was when I was\nstudying or writing papers or writing\ngrants or in the laboratory when I was\ndoing experiments with my hands in those\ndays you know cutting brain tissue and\nstaining it and working really long\nhours and I discovered that all of those\nthings all of those behaviors compounded\nwith my love of exercise and my love of\ndoing science and gave me these big\npeaks in what to me felt like even\nimportant experiences they felt you know\nunlike anything else they were just so\nso peak in their nature\nwhich was great and it did indeed\nenhance my performance however\nwhile it did not create a dependency for\nthose different substances caffeine\nsupplements Etc what I noticed was that\nin the days and sometimes weekends\nafterwards even though for much of my\ncareer I confess I've worked weekends as\nwell but I would notice that I'd\nexperience a real trough in energy I\njust would not feel that good and then\nif I kept up those behaviors\nconsistently and I was consistently\nadding in these other let's just call\nthem what they are dopamine releasing or\nstimulating behaviors and substances\nthat my enthusiasm for physical training\nor running\nor for doing experiments actually\nstarted to diminish and this was really\ndiscouraging to me at the time because I\nstarted to think okay maybe I'm burnt\nout maybe I have adrenal burnout which\nby the way doesn't exist folks your\nadrenals don't burn out there is\nsomething called adrenal insufficiency\nsyndrome you can over stimulate your\nsystem by way of too much adrenaline\nepinephrine and norepinephrine but\nthat's a separate thing there's no such\nthing as adrenal burnout per se\nbut I didn't know that so I thought gosh\nI'm really burnt out when in fact\nit's now obvious to me what I was doing\nI was combining too many dopamine\nreleasing or stimulating behaviors in\nsubstances for things that I already\nenjoyed doing as behaviors namely\nexercise and doing experiments anything\nrelated to science actually\nso what this means is not to avoid\ntaking things or doing things that\namplify your amount of dopamine but to\nbe very cautious about how often one\ndoes that and how many different\ndopamine stimulating behaviors or\ncompounds one stacks\nespecially in terms of taking those\nthings or stacking those things\nin and around behaviors that you already\nreally enjoy doing I was essentially\njust creating another version of the\nkids in nursery school or first grade\nwith the gold star experiment I was\nbasically just doing the exact same\nthing and when I realized that and I\nchanged my relationship to those\ncompounds I didn't eliminate them all\ntogether but I started realizing for\ninstance that I didn't need to double up\non yerba mate and coffee every workout\nsometimes I would do one sometimes I\nwould do the other frankly I always do\none or the other it's rare that I ever\ndo any kind of physical training without\nsome caffeine first and I do my physical\ntraining typically in the early part of\nthe day so that's fine doesn't interfere\nwith my sleep\nI might do a hike without caffeine but\nif I'm in a weight trainer I'm going to\nrun I tend to drink coffee beforehand or\nhave yerba mate\nor if I occasionally meaning about once\nevery third sometimes every other but\nusually about every third workout I'll\ntake 300 milligrams of alpha GPC maybe\noccasionally maybe every third or fourth\nworkout and these are resistance\nworkouts mind you not running I'll take\n500 milligrams of l-tyrosine or more\ntypically 500 milligrams of phenol\nethylamine and very very rarely maybe\nonce every two or three months I might\nstack all of those things together prior\nto a workout but of course I'm always\nmindful to also include workouts or runs\nor bouts of cognitive work so that could\nbe grant writing prepping for a podcast\nEtc where I don't do anything prior\nmaybe just my caffeine because I have a\nbaseline level of caffeine that I use\neach day to function like many people\nthere's a baseline level of caffeine\nthat just allows us to function if we're\na Perpetual user of caffeine I talked a\nlot about this on the episode in\ncaffeine but the key here is be cautious\nI would say be very cautious about\nstacking and layering in too many\ndopamine Peak inducing behaviors all at\nonce on a regular basis the key Point\nhere is if you are somebody that can\nengage in these intrinsically joyful\nactivities for you these activities that\nyou're really motivated to do whether or\nnot it's skiing or playing music or\ndancing Etc without the need to layer in\nadditional dopamine releasing mechanisms\nor compounds or activities well then I\nhighly recommend you do that because\nthen you are essentially making yourself\none of those fortunate few that does not\nrequire additional stimuli and therefore\ncan hold on to that pleasure can hold on\nto that intrinsic pleasure and\nmotivation to engage in these behaviors\nover time which frankly there is no\nreplacement for there is no pill or\nbottle or potion or motivational speech\nor podcast or book that can replace\nintrinsic motivation intrinsic\nmotivation is perhaps the Holy Grail of\nall human Endeavors and behaviors\nbecause it encompasses so much of what\nbrought us to this point in our species\nEvolution and also what brings each and\nevery one of us closer and closer to our\ngoals and if it's happening with\nenjoyment without the need to layer in\nadditional tools well then you have\nreally tapped into the source and when I\nsay the source I don't mean it in any\nkind of mystical way I think it's quite\nclear by now that when we hear about Chi\nfrom Eastern medicine or we talk about\nmotivation drive and pursuit in on\nWestern neurobiological languages that\nrelates to dopamine or we hear about the\nsource maybe in my podcast episode with\nthe one and only Rick Rubin incredibly\nproductive music producer who's as an\njust an unbelievable track record\nin terms of creative Endeavors and he\ntalks about the source we're really\ntalking about the same thing which is\nthis set of circuits within us that\nallow us to identify what we want and\nthen lean into effort and then to do\nthat in a persistent way that allows us\nto reach our goals and if we can do that\nwith an intrinsic sense of pleasure well\nthat is nothing short of magic but of\ncourse it's not magic it's science and\nof course most people are not concerned\nabout trying to protect the things they\nalready enjoy in order to make sure that\nthey can continue to do those things and\nenjoy them most people are thinking\nabout how they can engage and pursue\nthings that are less than pleasureful to\nthem or how they can continue to engage\nin motivated behaviors when the going\ngets tough or and this is a big one I\nhear this over and over again as a\nrequest to cover on this podcast how\npeople can overcome procrastination what\nwe're going to talk about now is how the\nDynamics of dopamine release that you\nalready are aware of plus and additional\nDynamic that we haven't quite talked\nabout can allow you to leverage dopamine\nin a way that really will bring you to\nthe Holy Grail of motivation and drive\nwhich is\nwhen effort starts to become the reward\nitself in other words when friction\nbecomes the reward I know that sounds\ncrazy to some of you but when friction\nbecomes the reward you can pass from an\nidea and a goal no matter how daunting\nto successful completion of that goal\nwhile experiencing what essentially will\nfeel like pleasure the entire time now\nthat doesn't mean it will be Bliss the\nentire time but what is very possible is\nto leverage the Dynamics of both\ndopamine Peaks and dopamine troughs\nin order to not just maintain your\nBaseline level of dopamine but to also\npull yourself out of any kind of\nprocrastination or other kind of\noverthinking trenches very quickly and\nget back into a mode of pursuit so how\ndo we make effort the reward you may\nhave heard about this in the context of\nso-called growth mindset growth mindset\nis the incredible Discovery and research\npapers from my colleague Dr Carol dweck\nin the psychology department at Stanford\nand there are others such as David\nYeager at the University of Texas Austin\nwho have leveraged the so-called growth\nmindset as a tool that young people and\nadults alike can use in order to get\nbetter at anything and the basic Contour\nof growth mindset is to adopt the\nmindset that if you can't do something\nor if you can't do it well\nthat you can't do it or can't do it well\nyet it's that word yet that's really key\nand there are a number of different\ntools and techniques that people use to\nadopt growth mindset but it all starts\nwith that relationship to not being able\nto do it yet now that all sounds pretty\nstraightforward when you tell yourself\nbut when we are in a performance context\nwhen we expect ourselves to be able to\nmotivate or when we expect ourselves to\nbe able to perform and we can't that\noften sets up a downward spiral of\nmotivation because we are so used to\nbeing attached to the relationship\nbetween\ndesire motivation and outcomes reward\nprediction error we want something we\nwant that a in class or we want to learn\nhow to dance or we want to be able to do\nthis uh physical skill of another kind\nor learn a language or get the mate we\ndesire or make the relationship work or\nmake the business work on and on and\nthen we get the outcome that we don't\nwant and our confidence for lack of a\nbetter word drops over time oftentimes\nthat leads to situations where we are\nnot motivated we are a motivated it can\neven lead to situations where we are\ndownright depressed\nthere's also circumstances where people\nmyself included of course procrastinate\nwe know we should do something but\nsomehow we can't get motivated we know\nthat if we put in the effort we'll get\nthere but we can't do it either because\nwe don't like the activity or we're just\nnot feeling great now we could\nbe quote unquote not feeling great not\nfeeling motivated because our dopamine\nBaseline is low and so I absolutely\nencourage everybody to take a look at\nthemselves anytime they're in a\nmotivated State take a look at the\nlandscape of their life not just at that\nmoment but in the preceding days and\nweeks and ask whether or not you've been\ntending to those foundational things we\ntalked about earlier whether or not you\nare engaging any other of the tools that\nwe talked about earlier to see if you\ncan get into a motivated State however\nif all of those boxes are checked you\nanswer yes I'm doing all those things\nI'm just not motivator I'm just whatever\nreason I just procrastinating I don't\nknow I don't want to do it or I'm not\nfeeling motivated\nwell then there's a very potent set of\ntools that you can leverage to overcome\nstates of lack of motivation overcome\nprocrastination and indeed can help you\ndeal with things like overthinking as it\nrelates to procrastination and lack of\nmotivation as well so the way this works\nis the following\nif you recall\na peak in dopamine is followed by a\ntrough in dopamine that trough in\ndopamine is experienced as pain or\nwanting or craving that pain that I'm\nreferring to is actually a craving or a\nwanting\nand it's a craving you're wanting for a\nspecific state that you would like to\nachieve that is different than the one\nthat you're in you want to get out of\nthat trough and as you recall from\nearlier in the episode that trough is\nthe stimulus for the ongoing release of\ndopamine that provides the propeller the\nmotivation to go forward and seek some\ngoal okay so when we are not motivated\nwhen we are in a so-called a-motivated\nstate\nor when we are procrastinating or when\nwe just sort of can't seem to get in\ngear the key to getting out of that pain\ntrough is one of two things I already\ntold you earlier you can just wait you\ncan wait till your motivation comes back\nand a lot of people do wait in fact they\nprocrastinate they start doing other\nthings that are less painful than the\nstate that they happen to be in\nwhen they are you know trying to get\ninto gear to go work out because I\nrealize not everyone wants to do that or\nto study or to have a hard conversations\nwhatever it is\nand what do they do they start engaging\nin activities that we and indeed they\nwould not consider pleasureful\nactivities they start for instance\ncleaning the house so seemingly out of\nnowhere they start engaging in these\nactivities that normally are not\nintrinsically pleasureful for them\nthey're not highly motivated to do them\nas a replacement for doing the very\nthing that they quote unquote need to do\nor ought to do and that they're\nprocrastinating to do\nwhat they're essentially doing here is a\nmild type of addiction replacement in\nother words rather than be in the\npainful State and wait for it to pass\nthey're doing things that give them some\nsense of accomplishment ostensibly\nto give them the sense that they're\ncompleting things and perhaps and I\ndon't know because I'm not um in the\npsychology of knowing what other people\nare thinking\nperhaps in order to generate the\nmomentum in order to get engaged enough\nor motivated enough to study or work out\nor whatever activity it is that they're\ntrying to avoid through procrastination\nnow what's interesting about this\nDynamic is first of all it's extremely\ncommon\nand second of all a lot of people will\nuse this as a tactic so that they get\nvery close to the deadline to complete\nsomething and then they go into a sort\nof pseudo panic and then use anxiety as\na way to leverage their mental and\nphysical resources to complete that\nthing how do I know the Contour of this\nso well how do I understand the inner\ndynamics of it well part of that relates\nto my work as a neurobiologist and\nreading the papers that I'll mention to\nyou in a moment but it also relates to\nthe fact that I'm somebody who Waits\nquite a while right up until the sort of\nlast minute possible to complete\nsomething for activities that I don't\nwant to do something I've been working\non my whole life in any case I'm very\nfamiliar with the procrastination\nprocess\nso how can we overcome procrastination\nwell it turns out that there are\nfindings from within the addiction\nliterature that turn out to be very\npowerful towards leveraging our way out\nof procrastination and it has to do with\nthis\nyou already know because I've told you\nprobably a dozen times now that the\ndepth of the trough after a dopamine\nPeak is proportional to how high that\nPeak was and how steep it was how\nquickly that Peak occurred it turns out\nthat not only is the depth of the trough\nproportional to that but the rate at\nwhich you get out of that trough\nis proportional to how steep that trough\nis\nlet me explain this for you in as clear\nterms as I possibly can imagine you're\nin an a-motivated State you're just not\nfeeling motivated you're procrastinating\nyou may think okay the thing to do here\nis something I'll clean the house I'll\ntake care of some bills I'll do\nsomething or I'll just wait those\napproaches as we talked about before\ngenerally don't work or at least don't\nwork quickly or they lead you right up\nto the deadline and that's the deadline\nthat forces you to get something done or\nyou just don't get it done and you don't\nsucceed in your goal that happens a lot\nas well\nhowever if you were to take that state\nof being unmotivated or procrastinating\nand actually do something that's harder\nthan being in that a-motivated state\nin other words doing something that's\nmore effortful even painful\nyou can rebound yourself out of that\ndopamine trough much more quickly so\nwhat do I mean you want to put yourself\nin a state that's worse than or harder\nthan the state that you're in or do\nsomething quote unquote more painful and\nhere I want to be very clear I'll say\nthis three times but I'm going to say it\nfor the first time now when I say more\npainful I do not mean doing any kind of\ntissue damaging or psychologically\ndamaging Behavior or anything of that\nsort that's going to render you injured\nor not well even in the short term\nthat's not what I'm referring to okay\nlet's just get that one out of the way\nwhat I'm referring to\nis the fact that for instance if you're\nfeeling a motivated but you find\nyourself cleaning the house as a way to\nprocrastinate you can say well cleaning\nthe house is harder than sitting down\nand doing nothing but actually in that\nmoment or in those moments that's not\nthe case or else you wouldn't be doing\nit the reality is that the dopamine\nsystem works according to what feels\nhard or easy in the Moment In other\nwords if you're feeling a motivated you\nneed to do something and put yourself\ninto a state that's harder than the\nstate you're in so for instance if\nyou're sitting around feeling a\nmotivated or you find yourself tending\nto tasks that are irrelevant to the goal\nthat you really should be focused on\nyou need to put your body and mind into\na state of discomfort\nquickly and the way to do that is to\neither engage in some tangential\nactivity meaning an activity not related\nto your goal that puts your body into a\nvery different state so here again I'll\ndefault to the obvious one which is\nsomething like cold shower or cold\nimmersion which not only increases\ndopamine long term or over several hours\nrather but for most people is\nexperienced as pain that pain causes a\nrebound out of that dopamine trough\nfaster than it would occur if you had\njust stayed in that a motivated State\nand waited for it to go away or done\nsomething like cleaning up that for\nwhatever reason felt like it required\nless friction when I say friction I mean\nlimbic friction your limbic system is\nalways in this dialogue with your\nforebrain and limbic friction goes two\nways limbic friction can be you're tired\nand you don't want to do something\nand so you have to quote unquote\nmotivate to do it energize yourself to\ndo it or limbic friction can be that\nyou're nervous and scared and anxious to\ndo something and you have to calm\nyourself in order to lean forward into\naction in order to do that thing despite\nthe anxiety I realize this can be a\nlittle bit confusing as a concept so I\nwant to go into a bit more detail let's\nimagine that you or somebody else does\nnot like to exercise you don't want\nexercise and you're trying to get your\nminimum of five days per week exercise\nand you're just not motivated to do it\nthere are a couple different techniques\nto doing this assuming you've taken care\nof all the Baseline stuff all the\nfoundational stuff we talked about\nearlier and you're just not getting in\ngear and you find yourself you know\nchecking your phone or maybe you're\ntending into some tasks obviously those\nthings are quote unquote easier for you\nmeaning they cause less limbic friction\nthan engaging in exercise\nthe typical advice would be\njust exercise for one minute okay just\nget one minute of exercise or five\nminutes and then use the successful\ncompletion of that one or five minutes\nas a milestone that allows you to then\nmove to the next Milestone and indeed\nthat approach can work and it's exactly\nwhat I'm describing here when I say that\nyou're in a state of lack of motivation\nor procrastination or both and you need\nto put yourself into a more painful not\nless painful state so what do you do you\npush up against that friction and you\nexercise for a short while and then that\npops you out of that trough that's\npossible but for a lot of people even\nthat won't be possible because they just\ncan't get motivated or they do that one\nminute or five minutes and they're just\nlike okay I'm still in the trough I'm\nnot actually feeling that great\nin those circumstances it makes sense to\ndo something that's tangential to the\nwhole path that you're trying to pursue\nthis goal that you're trying to pursue\nthat is Believe It or Not much worse\nthan just being a motivated and when I\nsay worse I don't mean picking some task\nthat normally you don't like to do but\nnow you're willing to do I mean\nliterally thinking about what would be\nworse than being in this state again\nwithout causing yourself tissue or\npsychological damage what would be worse\nwell cold water would be worse for many\npeople very cold water so the key is to\nfigure out something that for lack of a\nbetter way to put it really sucks really\nsucks and yet is safe and by doing that\nyou steepen\nthe trough you steepen the slope of the\ntrough which we know brings you back to\nyour Baseline level of dopamine more\nquickly now for some people that will be\ndeliberate cold exposure through cold\nshower ice bath and I have to tell you\nthat if you're cringing as I say this\nwell then there you go you now have a\ntool that you know you cringe even when\nyou just think about and therefore\nrepresents a great tool for you so if\nI'm procrastinating to do something I\nreally need to do should I just simply\nwait for that procrastination to\nevaporate no will it eventually\nevaporate maybe will a deadline\neventually surface that will trigger me\ninto an anxious or activated state that\nwill allow me to complete what needs to\nbe done maybe\nhopefully\nbut better would be to get out of that a\nmotivated state that state of\nprocrastination quickly and to do so you\nneed to leverage something that's\npainful so for instance I heard a\nbeautiful lecture recently done by Dr\nAnna Lemke at Stanford School of\nMedicine discussing dopamine and some of\nthe things in her book and some newer\nfindings as well and somebody in the\naudience asked her the question does\nmeditation increase dopamine now earlier\nwe talked about how non-sleep deep rest\nIn Yoga Nidra has been shown in the\nscientific literature to increase\ndopamine but I also mentioned earlier\nthat classic forms of meditation whether\neyes open or eyes closed so-called open\nmonitoring or closed monitoring\nmeditation sitting there lying there and\nfocusing does not increase dopamine\nlevels per se however for most people\nespecially people who find it hard to\nmeditate or who don't do that practice\nvery often\nmeditation is effortful getting into\nmeditation and staying in meditation is\neffortful\nso if you find yourself in a state of\nprocrastination oftentimes a brief five\nto ten minute meditation where you\nabsolutely do not allow yourself to do\nanything besides close your eyes focus\non your breath and when your mind drifts\nget back to your breath is not only\nextremely difficult and extremely\nfrustrating unless you're a\nwell-practiced meditator but it's often\ndifficult and frustrating not just to do\nbut to get into that practice and not\njust to get into that practice but to\nmaintain that practice for that mere\nfive to ten minutes because it's just\nnot a natural state for us to be in we\nhave to force ourselves so it is\neffortful in fact it qualifies as a\nbasically available almost anywhere\nanytime type of effortful activity that\nif you dislike it perhaps even as much\nas some people dislike deliberate cold\nexposure well then perfect you now have\nan additional tool in your kit that you\ncan use anytime you are feeling a\nmotivated and procrastinating\nnow there are numerous examples I could\ngive and hopefully there are numerous\nexamples that you're thinking about the\nkey is to have a short list of about\nfive different effortful AKA painful\nactivities that you can employ anytime\nyou're feeling a motivated or in a state\nof procrastination keeping in mind that\nthe goal is not what you accomplish\ninside of that activity although it is\nimportant that you actually engage in\nthat activity I actually have to make\nmyself meditate in that five to ten\nminute little bout of effortful or\npainful activity but it's not about\nachieving an outcome it's about forcing\nyour body and mind into a deeper state\nof pain and discomfort in other words\ntaking yourself from that trough that\nyou're already in and steepening and\ndeepening that trough because in\nsteepening and deepening that trough we\nknow that the return from that trough to\nnormal and even elevated levels of\nBaseline dopamine is going to be faster\nand more robust and in doing that you\nwill quick quickly find yourself back\ninto a motivated State because not only\ndoes it teach you that doing hard things\nis possible that's sort of more of a\nsubjective cognitive learning but it\nactually Taps into the very\nneurochemical system that allows you to\nthen feel motivated and capable to\npursue the larger goal which is the\nthing you're really concerned about\nafter all so as is often the case\nperhaps always the case on this podcast\nwe covered a lot of material we cover\ndopamine and what it is we talked about\nthe circuitry and the different kinds of\ncircuitry focusing mainly on this\nmesocortical pathway that is so vitally\nimportant to motivation for any goals\ntalked about the relationship between\nPeaks and troughs and bass lines and the\nfoundational tools that allow us to set\nand maintain a healthy Baseline level of\ndopamine as well as ways to protect that\nBaseline level of dopamine and we talked\nabout how to get ourselves out of states\nof procrastination\nand a Motivation by not just waiting out\nthose troughs in dopamine but actually\nmaking those troughs and dopamine\nsteeper by engaging in things that are\neffortful and things that we really\ndon't want to do in those moments\nprovided that those things are safe we\ncan get out of those dopamine troughs\nmore quickly and back to our dopamine\nbaseline or even above Baseline and we\ntalked about what I really view as the\nHoly Grail of motivation which is to be\nable to learn to attach reward to the\neffort process itself and to do so by\nnot just understanding but also learning\nto subjectively recognize and\nsomatically experience release of these\ndifferent stressful chemicals within our\nbody I realized this was a lot of\ninformation and yet throughout I've\ntried to highlight tools that you can\nuse that range from behavioral to\nnutritional supplementation tools\ncognitive tools and keep in mind that\nall of these different segments of the\npodcast is always are time stamps so if\nyou feel the need to go back and listen\nto any of these in order to get
