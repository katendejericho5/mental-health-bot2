    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday is an Ask Me\nAnything episode or AMA.\nThis is part of our\npremium subscriber channel.\nOur premium subscriber\nchannel was started in order\nto provide support for\nthe standard Huberman Lab\npodcast, which comes\nout every Monday\nand is available at\n0 cost to everybody\non all standard feeds, YouTube,\nApple, Spotify and elsewhere.\nWe also started the\npremium channel as a way\nto generate support for\nexciting research being\ndone at Stanford and elsewhere.\nResearch on human\nbeings that leads\nto important\ndiscoveries that assist\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nI'm also pleased to inform\nyou that for every dollar\nof the Huberman\nLab Premium channel\ngenerates for research studies,\nthe Tiny foundation has\nagreed to match that amount.\nSo now we are able to double\nthe total amount of funding\ngiven to studies of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand human performance.\nIf you'd like to subscribe\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nPremium channel, please go\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nIt is $10 a month to subscribe,\nor you can pay $100 all at once\nto get an entire 12-month\nsubscription for a year.\nWe also have a lifetime\nsubscription model\nthat is a one-time payment.\nAnd again, you can\nfind that option\nat hubermanlab.com/premium.\nFor those of you that\nare already subscribers\nto the premium channel, please\ngo to hubermanlab.com/premium,\nand download the premium\nsubscription feed.\nAnd for those of you that\nare not Huberman Lab podcast\npremium subscribers,\nyou can still\nhear the first 20 minutes\nof today's episode,\nand determine whether or not\nbecoming a premium subscriber\nis for you.\nAnd now without further ado,\nI will answer your questions.\nAnd as always, I\nwill strive to be\nas thorough as possible,\nas clear as possible,\nand as concise as possible.\nOur first question is about\nabstaining from thoughts.\nAnd in answering\nthis question, we're\ngoing to skirt right\nup against a topic\nthat I've covered before\non the podcast which\nis obsessive compulsive\ndisorder, which\nis a very serious disorder.\nI mean, it can have\na range of severity,\nbut people with true\nOCD suffer a lot\nfrom obsessions, these\nare intrusive thoughts,\nand compulsions, which are the\nbehaviors typically associated\nwith those thoughts.\nI think it's really\nimportant that we define\nOCD really clearly so\nthat we can make sure\nthat we're talking\nabout intrusive thoughts\nand the desire to abstain\nfrom thoughts versus OCD\nand where there might\nbe some overlap there.\nThe functional definition\nof OCD that really pertains\nto the disorder, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder,\nOCD as opposed to we\ncall people neurotic,\nor we say you have\nOCD, or I'm so\nOCD about this,\nor OCD about that,\nthat's become a common\nuse of the acronym OCD.\nBut true OCD is a\nsituation in which\nengaging in a particular\ncompulsive behavior\ndoes not serve to reduce the\nintensity or the frequency\nof the obsessions.\nIn fact, it makes it worse.\nSo the typical thing\nthat we hear these days\nis oh, you're so OCD, or\nhe's so OCD, or she's so OCD,\nor I'm so OCD.\nNow if someone is OCD in\nthat sense, OK, so not\nthe clinical disorder\nbut OCD in the sense\nthat they're really clean,\nthey're really fastidious,\nthey need everything perfect.\nHowever, that person can achieve\nsome level of calm and comfort\nthat's fairly long\nlasting if everything's\nclean and perfect,\nwell, then that's not\nobsessive compulsive disorder.\nThis is really\nimportant to understand\nas we venture into\nanswering the question\nabout intrusive\nthoughts and the desire\nto abstain from\ncertain thoughts.\nA person with true OCD will\nkeep cleaning and cleaning,\nor washing their hands,\nor arranging things\nat perfect right angles,\nbut the more they\ndo it, the more their\nanxiety goes up.\nA person who has more typical,\ngosh, we don't really even\nhave a language for this\nnowadays unfortunately,\nbut the sort of person that's\nextremely particular, they need\nthings a certain way, and\nthey're very driven to resolve\nthings and do things to make\nsure that things are done\nin a certain way, or\nhandled in a certain way,\nwell, if that person\ncan experience relief\nfrom engaging in let's say,\nexercise, or from cleaning,\nyou'd say you're so\nOCD about exercise.\nWell, but if exercising for\nan hour or even two hours\nin the morning make somebody\nreally calm the rest of the day\nand they don't need\nto exercise well,\nthen they're not\nnecessarily true OCD.\nThey don't necessarily have a\ndisorder related to exercise.\nHowever, if they're exercising\nfor two hours in the morning\nand then they find\nthey can't concentrate\non other things and their desire\nto exercise just increases\nand increases and becomes\nintrusive for them disrupting\ntheir quality of life\nthroughout the day,\nwell, then that's falling\nunder the umbrella of what\nwe would call a true disorder.\nSo we want to highlight\nthat because the question is\nabout a desire to\nabstain from thoughts,\nand the question is,\nin your discussion\nwith Dr. Anna Lembke--\nand I should just\nmention Dr. Anna Lembke is the\ndirector of our Dual Diagnosis\nAddiction Clinic at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine.\nShe's the author of this\nincredible book Dopamine Nation\nthat I think\neverybody should read.\nI do believe everyone\nshould read that book.\nSo important for the\naddict and nonaddict\nalike because it deals with\nbasically the state of our life\nnowadays.\nWe're living in this\ndopamine rich world\nwhere we can quickly become\ndopamine depleted, which\nis terrible, leads to\ndepression in addition to things\nlike addiction in\nsome folks, et cetera.\nAnna was a guest on the podcast.\nYou can find her episode\nat hubermanlab.com.\nJust put Anna.\nI think she's the\nonly guest we've\nhad thus far whose name is Anna,\nso it'll just pop up there.\nThe entire website\nis searchable.\nBut if you want to\nlisten to that episode\nor watch that episode, you\ncan access it hubermanlab.com.\nThe question is\nin your discussion\nwith Dr. Anna Lembke you\nwere talking about abstaining\nfrom people's drug\nof choice for 30 days\nto reset the dopamine\nreward pathway.\nAnd indeed that is the\nprescriptive that Dr. Anna\nLembke gives for\nmost all addictions\nand for people that are\nsuffering from milder even\nsevere depression\nrelated to dopamine\nseeking behaviors, social\nmedia, video games, sex, food,\net cetera.\nHowever, of course, in\nthe instance of food\nor in some other addictions,\nyou can't abstain for 30 days.\nThat would be terrible to\nabstain for food for 30 days.\nI'm sure people have done it,\nbut it is not healthy to do.\nCertain things like\nalcohol and drugs people\ncan abstain for\n30 days in efforts\nto never go back to them again.\nThere are cases of\nsevere alcohol or opiate\ndependence where people can't go\ncold turkey or they risk dying,\nso there they need to really\nwork with a physician.\nBut the 30-day reset\nof the dopamine system\nis something that's\nvery real and that\npertains to most people.\nThat is it's going to be\nvery effective for most\npeople struggling with\neither behavioral,\nor what are sometimes\ncalled process addictions,\nor other types of addictions\nincluding substance abuse\nissues.\nThe question continues.\nYou said you were\ngoing to ask Ana\nhow to abstain if\nyour drug of choice\nis a thought or\nnarrative as opposed\nto a substance or a behavior.\nThe question continues,\nas far as I can tell,\nyour discussion\nwith Ana moved on\nbefore you asked\nher the question.\nWould you be able to\ndiscuss strategies\nfor abstaining from addictive\nthoughts and narratives?\nOK.\nSo let's talk about\nintrusive thoughts,\nand let's start off by asking\nourselves, what is a thought?\nIn the realm of\nneurobiology, we have\nsensations which are the\nprocesses by which our neurons,\nnerve cells convert light,\nphotons, sound waves, touch,\nmechanical pressure, et\ncetera into electrical signals\nand chemical signals that\nhead into our nervous system,\nincluding our brain.\nAnd then our brain, at least\nwe think, make sense of them,\nand help us navigate\nthe world that we're in.\nSo the sensation part\nis a pure transformation\nof mechanical information,\nor in some cases,\nchemical information like smell.\nLiterally, volatile chemicals\nfloating around in the world\nare brought in through\nyour nose and your neurons\nand your olfactory\nbulb convert those\ninto electrical and\nchemical signals\nthat your brain can understand.\nPerceptions are your idea\nof what those signals out\nin the world are.\nEither because you're\npaying attention\nto them, or for some\nother reason you decide\nthat stop sign in\nfront of you is red,\nand that the sign\nbehind it is white,\nand that the sky is blue or\ncloudy, those are perceptions.\nSo we have sensations\nand perceptions.\nThen we have emotions\nwhich are these things that\ninclude the mind and\nbody that are related\nto neuromodulators like\ndopamine, serotonin, et cetera,\nalthough, those chemicals\ndo other things as well.\nAnd then, of course, we\nhave behaviors, actions.\nEverything from me moving\nmy pen on a piece of paper\nto walking, running, et cetera.\nThoughts are a fifth\ncategory of neural\nfunctioning that we\nreally need to define,\nbut that doesn't have\nas strict a definition\nas sensations, perceptions,\nor feeling, or action.\nBut thoughts are real.\nWe all know this.\nThoughts are real, and one way\nthat we can define thoughts\nis that thoughts are\nperceptions that include data\nfrom the past, present,\nor future, or combinations\nof past and present, or present\nand future, or future and past.\nI'm not trying to give an overly\ncomplicated definition here,\nbut if we are going to\nanswer a question about how\nto abstain from\nthoughts in a really\ndirect and actionable\nway, we really\nneed to address\nwhat our thoughts.\nSo thoughts are perceptions\nthat are generated internally.\nWe don't need any\nexternal sensation\nin order to have a thought.\nWe can close our eyes.\nWe could be in sensory\nisolation for that matter.\nWe could even be\nfloating with no gravity,\nand we can have a thought.\nThoughts tend to run pretty much\nautomatically in the background\nall the time.\nSome people refer\nto this as chatter\nin the back of our minds\nin a very unstructured way.\nAnd then if we\nforce our thoughts\nto be structured because\nwe decide they need to be,\nor if something\nin our environment\ncaptures our perception,\nthen our thoughts\ntend to be structured.\nLet me give you an example.\nIf I'm just walking\naround, if there\nwere a way in which\nwe could broadcast\nmy thoughts onto a screen,\nI hope we wouldn't do that.\nBut those thoughts\nwould be a mixture\nof semi-complete\nsentences and gibberish.\nHowever if somebody\nstops me, and says, hi.\nGood to see you.\nWhat are you doing today?\nAnd I start answering,\nwell, then my thoughts\nare suddenly being driven\nby an external stimulus,\ntheir question, and some\ninternal ideas, memory\nof who I am and what\nI'm doing that day so\npast and present, and so on.\nAnd so thoughts\nbecome structured.\nSo when we have a question about\nhow to abstain from thoughts,\nwe need to be\nadditionally specific\nand really pinpoint that\nwhat we're trying to do\nis to abstain from thoughts we\ndon't want presumably, either\nbecause they are too\nrepetitive and distracting,\nor because what's contained in\nthose thoughts is disturbing.\nThis is important because\nit gives us two answers\nto the questions that\nare highly divergent.\nOne answer to the\nquestion of how\nto abstain from intrusive\nthoughts, thoughts that\nwere addicted to, is if\nthose thoughts are merely\non loop all the time\nand we can't stop them,\nbut the thoughts themselves\naren't particularly disturbing.\nSo think about a song you\ncan't get out of your head,\nor you keep\nrecounting some event,\nbut the event itself\nisn't very disturbing.\nIt's just intrusive\nbecause it's there.\nWell, in that case,\nthe data really\npoint to trying to\nanchor your thoughts\nto some external stimulus.\nSo getting into action,\ngetting into activities\nthat really draw your attention\naway from that thought.\nNow you may still hear it\nscrolling in the background,\nso you might be sitting in\nclass still hearing that loop\nof thoughts in the background.\nThat's something that\nover time ought to wane,\nit ought to disappear\nif we try and bring\nmore and more attention\nto whatever it\nis that's in our\nenvironment, whatever\nit is that we happen to be\nlearning or doing physically,\net cetera.\nThings like mindful meditation.\nDoing a 10 or even\njust 5 minute a day\npractice of sitting\nwith eyes closed,\nor lying down with eyes\nclosed and really focusing\non one's breath, focusing\none's attention on sometimes\ncalled the third eye\ncenter, but in science we'd\nsay just the region right\nbehind the forehead,\nyou're directing\nyour attention there,\nhas been shown to increase\nfocus for singular topics\nand can improve memory and do a\nbunch of other things as well.\nThose are data from Dr. Wendy\nSuzuki's lab at New York\nUniversity.\nShe was a guest on\nthe podcast as well.\nMy laboratory has run studies\non mindful meditation as well.\nSo what you're\nreally trying to do\nis learn how to focus\nbetter on one thing,\nand by focusing\non that one thing,\nyou focus off these\nrepetitive thoughts.\nNow, I have a feeling that\nthis question was asked\nand that many people\nupvoted this question\nbecause the issue isn't\njust thoughts that\nare intrusive because\nthey're there and on repeat,\nbut because the thoughts\nthemselves are actually\ntroubling.\nThis could be recounting a\ntrauma, someone harmed you,\nyou observed something that was\ndisturbing, you felt wronged,\nyou felt someone\nelse was wronged,\nyou can't seem to get your\nmind off of something,\nand your emotions\ntend to follow,\nand so it's uncomfortable.\nI have a feeling this is\nthe root of the question.\nIn that case, the approach\nis very different.\nWhat we know from essentially\nall of the quality\nscientific and\nclinical studies is\nthat those sorts of\nintrusive thoughts\nare very much like a trauma.\nNow we have to be clear in\ndefining what trauma is.\nI'll use the definition\nthat Dr. Paul\nConti, another incredible\nguest that was on our podcast.\nA Stanford-Harvard\ntrained psychiatrist.\nI think one of the\nworld's foremost leaders\non the issue of trauma and\npsychiatry and psychology\ngenerally.\nHe defines trauma as an event\nor something that fundamentally\nchanges the way that your\nnervous system works such\nthat you function less\nadaptively going forward\nfrom that event.\nSo not every bad occurrence\nin your life is a trauma.\nThat's good news.\nThe bad news is many\npeople have traumas,\nand traumas change the way\nthat our nervous system\nworks so that we don't\nfunction as well as we could.\nSo in that sense, intrusive\nthoughts that are disturbing\nare in many ways traumas and\nare reinforcing that trauma.\nNow, we know that almost\ncounterintuitively\nin order to deal\nwith trauma, you\nhave to get very\nclose to that trauma.\nYou don't have to\nreexpose, and I\nwould hope you would\nnot reexpose yourself\nto the very same trauma.\nBut we know that one of the\nbest ways to deal with traumas\nis to get very clear about the\nnarrative around those traumas.\nNow this can be done\nwith a therapist ideally,\nbut not everyone has access to\ntherapy or can afford therapy.\nThere's a range of quality of\ntherapists for that matter,\nso we're always referring\nto the desire for people\nto do great therapy\nwith really great,\nmeaning excellently\ntrained people.\nBut it turns out that if you\nwant to extinguish an intrusive\nthought, one of the\nbest ways to do that\nis to journal about that\nparticular thought extensively.\nSo rather than the earlier\nstrategy for intrusive thoughts\nwhere they're just on\nloop, and intrusive\nbecause they're on\nloop and present,\nbut their content\nisn't disturbing,\nwhen that thought is\ndisturbing and intrusive,\nwe know that it's very\nuseful to script out\nas much detail about\nthat particular thought\nand the things around\nit as possible.\nNow obviously, you want\nto do this in a way that\nis fairly structured.\nSo you ideally would\nuse complete sentences.\nSo the reason for doing\nthat is that thoughts,\nas I mentioned earlier,\ncan often be fragmentary.\nSo they pop up in\nour mind almost\nwe seemingly spontaneously.\nThey're inhibiting\nour ability to focus,\nor be present at work, or\nfamily, or other things,\nor sleep.\nWriting things down\nin a lot of detail\ndoes seem to have this\nquality of both reducing\nthe emotional load of whatever\nit is that thought is about,\nas well as diminishing the\nfrequency of those intrusive\nthoughts over time.\nSo this is far and away\ndifferent than the strategy\nI mentioned for the other\ntypes of intrusive thoughts.\nAnd really it's far\nand away different\nfrom the 30-day\nabstinence approach\nthat Dr. Anna Lembke was\ntalking about for substance\nor behavioral addictions.\nNow, of course, this process\nof abstaining from thoughts\nor removing the addictive\nnature of certain thoughts\ncan definitely take some time.\nSo a good example there\nwould be superstitions.\nI'll come clean\nhere, and I've talked\nabout this before\non a few podcasts\nthat when I was in\ncollege, I developed\na knock on wood superstition.\nAny time I'd say something that\nI didn't want to happen or did\nwant to happen, I'd say, knock\non wood, and I'd knock on wood.\nAnd then I started suppressing\nthe behavior mostly\nbecause it was a\nlittle embarrassing.\nAnd then I started just\ntelling myself in my head,\nknock on wood, knock\non wood, knock on wood.\nAnd it was clearly a little\nbit of an OCD type thing,\nbut again, OCD in\nair quotes here.\nI think it qualified\nas OCD in the sense\nthat the more I did it,\nthe more I wanted to do it.\nSo I needed to go cold\nturkey on the thinking,\nbut how can you go cold\nturkey on a thought?\nYou couldn't.\nWhat I was told to do and\nwhat worked very well for me\nwas to just write down\nthe worst possible outcome\nthat I was concerned about.\nSo to really get close to the\nnature or the underlying basis\nof that intrusive thought.\nAnd I raise this\nbecause a lot of times\nthe intrusive thought\nis not, OK, I'm\nthinking about a\ncar accident, or I'm\nthinking about a breakup, or\nI'm thinking about an exam\nthat I have.\nThat can be intrusive,\nbut a lot of times\nit's some kind of\nnebulous, abstract,\nset of words, or ideas,\nor images around something\nthat happened that we saw\nor heard or experienced.\nAnd by putting a lot\nof clear structure\nto what the thought is exactly\nand to putting some thought\nand structure onto paper\nabout what that pattern of not\nhealthy thinking\nrelates to, people often\nachieve tremendous relief in\na fairly short amount of time.\nSometimes just in one\nsession of writing it down,\nsometimes they need to write\nit down multiple times.\nWhat you're essentially trying\nto do with a intrusive thought\nor a trauma of\nany kind is you're\ntrying to turn a disturbing\nstory, that is a story that\nevokes a lot of\nemotion and captures,\nit hijacks your nervous system,\ninto what is essentially\na known but repetitive\nand old, boring story\nwhere the emotional\nload has been depleted.\nAnd there are, of course, I\nhave to highlight the fact\nthat getting sufficient rapid\neye movement sleep we also know\nis very important for\nremoving the emotional load\nof traumatic experiences\nand intrusive thoughts.\nSo you really want to strive to\nget the best possible sleep you\ncan.\nThat includes sufficient\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd we have multiple\nzero-cost resources\nfor that at hubermanlab.com.\nWe have the episode\non mastery or sleep.\nWe have the episode on\nperfecting your sleep.\nWe have the toolkit for sleep.\nAll of which are time\nstamped and all of which\ncan be accessed to completely\nzero cost to try and get\nyour sleep as good as\npossible, including lots\nof rapid eye movement sleep.\nSo in order to remove intrusive\nand addictive thoughts,\nask yourself, is this\nOCD of the classic sense?\nIf it is, you should\nsee a psychiatrist.\nThey won't necessarily\nprescribe medication,\nbut there are tools\nfor true OCD that are\nvery effective in many cases.\nAnd we did the episode\non OCD which I invite\nyou to listen to as well.\nYou want to ask yourself,\nare the thoughts\ndisturbing or merely\nintrusive and repetitive?\nIf they're merely intrusive\nand repetitive, well,\nthen learning to focus your\nattention on other things\nand getting better at\nfocusing on single things\nthrough an exercise\nlike mindfulness,\nmeditation can really help.\nAnd indeed perhaps the best\nuse of mindfulness meditation\nis to improve your\nlevel of focus.\nIt does have other\nbenefits as well,\nbut that's going to be the major\none that one will experience\neven with these very short 5\nor 10-minute day meditations.\nGreat data on that from\nthe scientific literature.\nAnd then if those intrusive\nthoughts are not only intrusive\nbut they're also\ndisturbing, in that case,\nyou really want to put as\nmuch structure and thought,\nbelieve it or not, into\nwhat those thoughts are\nreally about.\nWrite them out on paper\nin complete sentences\nand maybe do that multiple\ntimes until the underlying\nemotions related\nto those thoughts\nreally start to diminish.\nAnd by doing that,\nyou're essentially\ndoing your own form\nof trauma therapy,\nfor lack of a better\nway to put it.\nAnd again, the data\nreally point to the fact\nthat getting close to\nthe specific details\naround those\nintrusive thoughts is\ngoing to be the best\nway to extinguish them.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlabs.com/premium\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast Premium channel\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel which,\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research, in\nparticular research done\non human beings.\nSo not animal models\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree is the species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels.\nNot just the premium channel\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast and\nother media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth, and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the research that\nprovides those kinds of answers\nin the first place.\nNow an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do a\ndollar-for-dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs,\nyou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,\nand you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
