    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr Sachin Panda Dr Sachin panda\nis a professor and director of the\nregulatory biology laboratory at the\nSalk Institute of biological studies\nhis laboratory has made numerous\nimportant contributions that impact\nmental health physical health and human\nperformance for instance his laboratory\ndiscovered the neurons in the eye and\nneurons within the brain that regulate\nour so-called circadian rhythm circadian\nrhythms are 24-hour rhythms and\neverything from gene expression to the\noverall functioning of tissues our\nlevels of mood and alertness our ability\nto sleep appetite and much much more in\naddition over the last decade Dr Panda's\nlaboratory has made critical discoveries\nin terms of how our patterns of eating\nover time impact our biology and our\nhealth in particular his laboratory\nPioneer discoveries related to so-called\nintermittent fasting also sometimes\nreferred to as time restricted feeding\ntoday Dr Panda and I discuss how our\ncircadian behaviors everything from when\nwe wake up to when we view light to when\nwe avoid viewing light to when we eat\nand what we eat and when we socialize\nand how we socialize impacts our biology\nand our psychology energy and how all of\nthat has a strong impact on our health\nduring today's discussion you will learn\nhow restricting your feeding to specific\nperiods within each 24 hour cycle or\nperhaps even exploring longer patterns\nof fasting and eating Cycles can impact\neverything from the health of your liver\nto your gut to your brain and how all of\nthat impacts things like mood and your\nability to perform cognitive work indeed\ntoday's discussion goes deep into all\naspects of intermittent fasting AKA time\nrestricted feeding we talk about the\nbasic science as well as the recent\nclinical trials that have explored\ntime-restricted feeding in a diverse\nrange of people including men women\nchildren people with diabetes people who\nare otherwise healthy and much much more\nI'm quite aware that intermittent\nfasting is a topic of much debate these\ndays we go deep into that debate and by\nthe end of today's discussion you can be\ncertain that you will have learned all\nthe latest and all the details all all\nmade very clear to you thanks to the\nincredible expertise Discovery and clear\ncommunication of Dr Panda as some of you\nmay already know Dr Panda has authored\nseveral important books on the topic of\nintermittent fasting and how it can\nbenefit various aspects of Health those\nbooks include the Circadian code and a\nmore recent book the Circadian diabetes\ncode both of which we've provided links\nto in the show note captions in addition\nif any of you are interested in learning\nmore about Dr Panda's work including\nseeing his Publications and reading\nthose Publications we're supporting his\nlaboratory you can do that by going to\nhis laboratory website which we have\nalso linked in the show note captions\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is hvmn Ketone IQ hvmn\nKetone IQ is a supplement that increases\nblood ketones I want to be clear that I\nam not following a ketogenic diet most\npeople fall into this category they are\nnot following a ketogenic diet they are\nomnivores and they do eat carbohydrates\nso their standard fuel source for the\nbrain and body is not ketones however I\nfound that by taking Ketone IQ which we\nknow increases blood ketones I can\nachieve much better focus for longer\nperiods of time for any kind of\ncognitive work and much greater energy\nlevels for exercise especially if I'm\ngoing into that exercise fasted and find\nmyself a little bit hungry when I start\nthat exercise this is no surprise we\nknow that ketones are the brains and\nbody's preferred fuel source even if\nyou're not following a ketogenic diet so\nin other words I and many other people\nare now starting to leverage endogenous\nketones as a fuel source for the brain\nand body and yet we are not following a\nketogenic diet and of course if you are\nfollowing a ketogenic diet Ketone IQ\nwill further allow you to increase your\nblood ketones as a source of brain and\nbody fuel if you'd like to try Ketone IQ\nyou can go to hvmn.com

tracking capacity\nas I've talked about before on the\nhuberman Lab podcast there is a critical\nrelationship between sleep and body\ntemperature that is in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature needs to drop by about one\nto three degrees and in order to wake up\nin the morning and feel alert your body\ntemperature needs to increase by about\none to three degrees the problem with\nmost people's sleeping environment is\nthat even if you make the room cool the\nactual environment that you sleep on\nthat is your mattress and underneath\nyour covers is hard to regulate in terms\nof temperature with eight sleep\nregulating the temperature of that\nsleeping environment becomes incredibly\neasy in fact you can change the\ntemperature of that environment across\nthe night making it a little bit cool at\nthe beginning of the night even cooler\nstill a few hours into your sleep which\nreally helps getting into very deep\nsleep and then warming it as you\napproach warnings so that you wake up\nfeeling most alert I've been sleeping on\nan eight-sleep mattress cover for over a\nyear now and it is completely\ntransformed my sleep if

to\nSmart drugs and as a neuroscientist what\nI can tell you is that you have circuits\nin your brain that allow you to focus\nyou have circuits in your brain that\nallow you to be creative you have\ncircuits in your brain that allow you to\ntask switch and on and on in other words\nthere is no specific brain circuit or\neven circuits for being quote unquote\nsmart thesis understands this and has\ndeveloped nootropics that are customized\nto different types of mental operations\nwhat do I mean by that well they have\nformulas that can put your brain into a\nstate of increased Clarity or Focus or\ncreativity or that can give you more\noverall energy for things like physical\nexercise I often take the thesis Clarity\nformula prior to law long bouts of\ncognitive work and I'll use

with Dr Sachin\nPanda Sachin Dr Panda so good to see you\nagain yeah good to see you we are\ncolleagues still but we used to be right\nacross the street from one another yeah\nyeah you remember those days yeah yeah\nso I'm delighted that you're here\num I think we're going to talk about a\nnumber of things mainly\nintermittent fasting time restricted\nfeeding and health but also the many\nother things that you're doing just\nbefore we started recording we were\ndiscussing your recent paper in nature\nuh that involved recordings from\npost-mortem Human retina so maybe if\nthere's time at the end we can get back\nto uh your lab has shown that you can\nessentially maintain or resurrect\nneurons from\nuh dead people in order to potentially\nand eventually provide transplants to\nrescue Vision in the blind so that's\nextremely exciting but of course not the\nmain focus of today's discussion so\nwe'll have to uh split it up\num the first question I have is how am I\nsupposed to Define\nfasting and time restricted feeding in\nmeaning when I go to sleep every night\nI'm not eating so in some sense\neverybody\nis doing time restricted feeding to some\ndegree or another yeah at what point can\nwe start thinking about a pattern of\neating as time restricted feeding\nso-called intermittent fasting\ndoes it have to do with how regular one\nis about the start and stop times how do\nyou think about defining intermittent\nfasting time restrictive feeding and\nmaybe just to simplify the conversation\nis one term more correct than the other\nin terms of describing this incredible\npattern of feeding\nwell you know that intermittent fasting\ncovers many types of fasting\num so actually it started long time ago\nand it's embedded into the history of\ncaloric restriction\num almost 100 years ago people showed\nthat if you reduce\ncalorie intake in a rat then that rat\ncan live for a long time\nand in those experiments the calories\nwere reduced every single day\nand that led to the idea that if we cut\ndown our calories by 20 percent say then\nwe can potentially live longer by doing\ntwo things one is preventing is related\ndisease or even if we follow fall sick\nmaybe we can accelerate cure\nand keep the repair mechanism going so\nthat we can live longer\nbut it was very difficult to\ncount calories every day and reduce\nmaintain that\num\nI must say that it's not that calorie\nrestriction is impossible or we are not\ndoing it in fact\na lot of us we do\num count calories in our subconscious\nmind means every time you took out it\nyou took out we take out a soda bottle\nor something I'm looking at it okay or\nin 60 kilocalo or 30 kilocal or zero\nkilocal we are doing that so the point\nis it's it's we are doing subconsciously\nsome kind of calorie\ncounting but reducing calorie by Twenty\nthirty percent every single day is not\npossible for many people so then the\nidea came in mouse and rat experiment\nwhether they can eat every other day\num and in fact this every other day\nfeeding\num also led to very similar almost\nequivalent Health Improvement as\ncontinuous calorie restriction\num so then the idea was well every other\nday is a little bit hard for humans but\njust imagine I would just get to eat\nonly one day and then another day\nthen the idea came well for humans can\nthey eat less for one or two days in a\nweek\nso that led to this pipe two diet where\npeople can eat for five days and then\ntwo days they have to reduce calories so\nthat's also\nintermittently people are fasting\num then as you know Walter longer also\ncame with this idea that periodic\nfasting maybe four or five days in every\nmonth or two months three months you can\nfast or reduce calorie\nand he also found many benefits of\ncalorie restriction was there were those\nstudies on humans many of the studies\nstarted it in mice but alternate day\nfasting five two and\num Walters periodic fasting all of them\nhave now been done in humans not for\nlongevity of course because\ncannot do this for a long time but for\nweight maintenance for reducing some\nsigns of aging or reversing those things\nhave been done so all of them have been\ndone in humans mostly healthy humans and\nin some cases people with pre-diabetes\nor some aspects of metabolic disease so\nthat led to the idea that that all these\nforms of fasting in which\nthe total caloric intake on any given\nday is reduced for one or more days in a\nweek a month that became that umbrella\nterm became intermittent fasting\nso if you\nlook up the scientific literature most\nintermittent fasting involves\nintentionally reducing calories\nfor at least one or two days in a week\nor\num few days in a month\nso when we publish time restricted\nfeeding\num the initial Mouse experiments and\neven now most of the mouse experiments\nwe want to test what is the impact of\ntime restriction versus calorie\nrestriction\nso in these experiments we don't reduce\ncalorie on any day of mouse life so the\nmice is the same number of calories as\nthe adlibitum FED mice\nbut still they say health benefit so\nthat's why we call it time restricted\nfeeding\nbut since it involves\nliving without food for several hours\nfor some people which is it can be very\ndifficult the initial experiments was\ndone they were done for eight hours of\nfeeding and 16 hours of fasting that\nkind of became popular and so that\nthat's why people use the same term as\nintermittent fasting and now if you\nsay intermittent fasting and popular\nliterature or popular media then people\nusually refer to time restricted eating\nso now coming back to\nhow do you define time restricted\nfitting\num so the way we have been trying to\nDefine\nexperimentally and also in literature is\num\ntrying to\nconfine all your energy intake from\nsolid and liquid food combined within a\nconsistent window of 8 to 12 hours\nbecause that's something that doable of\ncourse people have done time restrictive\ntrading with four hours six hours and\nsome people even try to eat everything\nwithin two hours one meal a day\num but the point is those are not\nfeasible to maintain for very long time\nfor a lot of people\none question about the six hour versus\neight hour versus 12 hour feeding window\nis it important that the feeding window\nbegin and end at the same time more or\nless yeah and if so how much flexibility\nis there so for instance I'm somebody\nthat\nI am not terribly hungry in the morning\nI like to drink water usually some\ncaffeine and electrolytes yeah in the\nperiod before my first meal and my first\nmeal always lands sometime between\n11 and 11 A.M and 12 noon there are\nexceptions yeah occasionally I'll have a\nbreakfast a proper breakfast as it's\ncalled Uh I guess it would be improper\nif you're intermittent fasting for me\num but typically 11 A.M or noon is when\nI first eat my last bite of food is\ntypically around I don't know 39 PM\nthat's what works for me yeah\nis that consistency affording me any\nbenefit separate and let's just leave\naside total caloric number\nmacronutrients plant-based meat Etc but\nis there any benefit to shortening that\nfeeding window that we are aware of or\nextending that feeding window or being\neven more rigid about the start and end\nof that feeding window\nyeah so the start of the fitting window\num that's interesting because the\nconcept of time history feeding when I\ndescribe animal studies it's feeding for\nhumans it's eating so the concept\nactually came from the science of\ncircadian rhythm so that means um\nour body has an internal timetable\nthat's present in every cell in every\norgan\nthat pre-programs many\nmolecular aspects of the cells that\nleads to physiology and all that stuff\nso that essentially there is a\npredetermined timetable for every cell\nevery organ to do certain things at\ncertain time\nand\nthe Circadian clocks as\nyou and I know are more sensitive to\nlight light is the most dominant\num time Giver so for example when\ndaylight saving time changes or when we\ntravel from one time zone to another\ntime zone we feel kind of crappy because\nour daily activities uh out of sync\nfrom our internal clock\nso that was known for a very long time\nbut then around the year 2000 2002\nthere was a famous experiment by Uli\nsibler from\nSwitzerland what he did he just\nFair demise at the wrong time mice are\nnocturnal their night feeders and when\nhe fed the mice during their time and\nthe liver clock instead of\nfollowing its own routine liver clock\nactually started following food so that\nmeans by changing our feeding time we\ncan change we can tune our liver plot\nand subsequently the same experiment has\nbeen repeated many times and when we\nrepeated that in 2009\nand we figured out Yes actually outside\nthis\nbrand Center called Supra chiasmatic\nnucleus or scn which\nis considered the master circadian clock\nalmost\nrest of the brain even\nfollows when we eat and that came out\nfrom Pierre shambon's lab in Europe\nwhere they systematically looked at even\nplaces that are very close to the asean\nfor those who are who node or some\nmedial hypothalamus or paraventricular\nnucleus all of this\nwithin a couple of four or five\nmillimeters of the scn but they were\nfollowing food queue\namazing so then\num and now if we think about it so for\nexample when the daylight saving time\nchanges just one hour change\num or one hour change in alignment\nbetween our internal time and external\ntime leads to kind of feeling groggy and\nfilling not out of Peak Performance for\none or two days\nso the rule of thumb is when the time\nGiver\nchanges by one hour then our internal\nclock takes at least a day to catch up\nso that means if you're flying from\nLA to New York uh you're moving through\nthree time zones then on an average it\nwill take three uh three days to catch\nup with the New York Times for some\npeople it can be even slower and for\nsome people it can be two days but the\nbottom line is yes there is a\ndecentrality so then what does it mean\nfor the body sorry one of the function\nof clock is to anticipate when you're\ngoing to wake up for example so the\nblood pressure slightly goes up our\nheart rate goes up our breathing goes up\nsimilarly for food\nalmost every organ that is involved in\nfeeding or eating digestion all of them\nhave clocks\nso even from saliva production that's\nthe first phase of digestion to\nsecretion of all the digestive juice and\nthe stomach and the absorption of\nnutrients and liver metabolism\neverything the whole village expects one\nyou're supposed to eat and they're\ngetting ready\nfor you to eat the first meal after\nfasting for a long time so that's why\nit's breaking the fast of breakfast\nand when that time changes when you\nchange it by two or three hours from one\nday to another then\num sometimes they're like oh food didn't\ncome or maybe\num will come at a wrong time we were at\nthe wrong time and then they will track\nthe new eating time so suppose say one\nday you have been eating every day at\neight a.m\num I ate at 8am is that when you start\nyeah\nwhen do you when does your feeding\nWindows shut uh 6 p.m so I eat for\naround 10 hours okay\num and then one day if I switch to 10 am\nthen what happens is\na clerk is thinking well the food didn't\narrive at eight but it arrived at 10\nmaybe tomorrow the food will arrive\nsomewhere between eight and ten so we'll\nbe ready around nine\nand next day if I come back and eat at\neight o'clock then I may eat but my\nclock is not ready to digest that food\nso that's why this idea is you have to\nbe consistent uh to take advantage of\nthis anticipatory activity of our cloth\nin different systems to get the best out\nof it is there evidence that those\nanticipatory systems and as they relate\nto digestion help us better assimilate\nour food I would imagine so I mean if\nyou have the gastric juices that are\ngoing to help digest the proteins fats\nand carbohydrates and uh already\ndeployed at the time when you eat I\ncould imagine that food will be better\nutilized than if you don't so in other\nwords what is the advantage of having\nthese anticipatory signals in terms of\npotential health benefits the\nanticipatory signal is really important\nfrom even even from working up\num\nthe reason why many people feel not\nready completely when they'll wake up to\nan alarm clock because the alarm clock\nwakes you up but your body is not\nprepared so that slippiness after waking\nup to an alarm clock is due to our body\nis not prepared for that and then the\nbest example is when the when\nuh the daylight saving time changes\nparticularly when we have to wake up one\nhour early uh what happens people who\nhave underlying heart condition\num when they're waking up when the body\nis not ready your heart is not ready and\nall operations from the heart has to\nstart pumping little bit harder then\nthere is chance of heart attack and in\nfact people have looked at hospital\nrecords and that they find that on those\ndays and there is a sharp rise in heart\nattacks in car accidents and car\naccidents too because your brain is not\ncoordinated so you cannot make those\nfine decisions\nso that's a great example of\nanticipatory activity but coming back to\ndigestion one thing is\num\nand this is something that many people\nmight have experienced\nthere are many rhythms in our digestive\nsystem and one of the rhythms is our\nlook our intestine has this peristaltic\nfunction so it kind of contracts and\nexpands and that moves forward more food\ndoesn't move due to gravity so it goes\nback and forth and that peristaltic axon\nactually slows down at night a few hours\nafter our last meal and\num so that's why when people eat late at\nnight for example then that food doesn't\nget digested because there is not enough\ndigestive juice first thing and second\neven if it gets digested in the stomach\nit doesn't move properly so then the\nnext morning people get up and think\num of course people consume some alcohol\nvery often and then they think that this\nis Hangover but those who don't consume\nalcohol then they have the food hangover\nbecause it doesn't digest so that's one\nextreme example where food\nat the wrong time\ncan\num so healthy food at the wrong time can\nbe crap or junk yeah I've um experienced\nthat where if I've worked late or I\ncouldn't eat dinner or something and\nthen I get home I always debate whether\nor not to try and sleep yeah but if I'm\ntoo hungry oftentimes it's challenging\nand so for me sometimes consuming\nsomething that at least seems easily\ndigestible like yogurt or something in a\nliquid form\num is better for me than if I eat a meal\nI've made the mistake of going to the\nrefrigerator being super hungry and\neating a bunch of food at 10 or 11 p.m\nand then falling asleep and indeed the\nsleep\nif I'm tired enough can be quite deep\nbut the next morning I feel just\ncompletely physically and and\ncognitively weighed down so I think what\nyou just described makes a lot of sense\nso is it so if someone were to select a\nfeeding window regardless of whether or\nnot it falls into classic intermittent\nfasting time restricted feeding sounds\nlike eating your first bite of food and\neating your last bite of food at more or\nless the same time each day yeah has\nbenefits\nI have this question you mentioned\nfeeding versus eating and I think it's\nactually not just a grammatical uh\nsemantic issue\num and here's why\nwe tend to think about when you take\nyour first bite of food and then when\nyou take your last bite of food but of\ncourse Foods digest at different rates\nmore fat in there is going to digest\nmake carbohydrates digest slower Etc I\nmean there's all these adjustments to\nthe glycemic index and so forth with\nFoods in combination\nI is it better to think about not eating\nbut your fed State and blood sugar so\nfor instance I often get asked on social\nmedia does blank break a fast so uh and\nso I like to think about it\nscientifically like okay is does plain\nwater break a fast no does air break a\nfast no\num does one grain of sugar\nof sucrose break a fast well probably\nnot but does one teaspoon of sugar break\na fast well you could say yes but\ntransiently like so I mean when we're\ntalking about breaking a fast are we\ntalking about a rise in blood glucose or\nare there molecular signals Downstream\nof of a rise in blood glucose that\num cannot be reversed in other words if\nI'm gonna eat my first meal every day at\nnoon and I'm gonna eat my last bite of\nfood at 8 00 pm and at 9 00 a.m for\nwhatever reason I have coffee with one\nteaspoon of sugar in it\nI suppose in the strictest sense I've\nbroken my fast but maybe by if I went\nfor a hard run that morning maybe by 9\n30 a.m I'm back in a quote unquote\nfasted state so what is the fasted State\nreally because when I'm eating at 8 pm\njust to give another example\nI'm start fasting at 801 perhaps yeah\nbut I have my blood glucose is elevated\nso I'm not really fasted I'm fed yeah\nit's just that I'm not eating the verb\nright okay so\num so again I I don't want to get overly\ndetailed just for sake of getting detail\nbut I think a lot of the confusion out\nthere about what breaks a fast yeah is\nrelated specifically to this issue yeah\nwhich is if I eat a whole pizza after\nsitting around all day it's very\ndifferent than if I eat a whole pizza\nafter having run a 26 mile marathon that\nyeah very different yeah\num metabolically speaking so how should\npeople think about fasted versus fed can\nwe be mildly fasted versus severe fasted\ncan we be\num fed-ish versus very fed anyway I'll\nI'll uh stop asking questions now\nbecause they all relate to the same\ntheme yeah no these are um very\ninteresting question and then\nunfortunately as you can as you have you\nmight have seen in life the most obvious\nquestions are often unanswered because\nit's so hard to do these damn\nexperiments because if you really want\nto address this in humans you have to\nbring humans put them in isolation\njust like you said I can now imagine\nplanning five or six different\nexperiments each experiment should\ninvolve eight or ten volunteers it's\ngender sex\nand then do it so it's difficult so now\nlet's go back to see\nhow do we let's dissect it in terms of\nsay indirect calorimetry so for example\nindirect calorimetry is based on this\nprinciple that whatever oxygen we\nbreathe in and carbon dioxide we breathe\nout if we can measure these two then we\ncan figure out whether our body\nin total we are not saying whether it's\nthe liver gut or fat or muscle in total\nwhether it's consuming glucose or fat as\nenergy source\nthe idea is when we fast when we are\nwithout food for several hours\nthen\nideally our body will tap onto glycogen\nfirst and then do a little bit of fat\nand then when the body is mostly running\non fat then that ratio of CO2 to oxygen\nwill come to 0.7\n[Music]\num\nbut what is interesting is we can do\nthese experiments in mice so we can go\nto mice and ask okay so what happens in\nmice so\nand mice mice are a little bit very\ndifferent because mice are not simply\nlittle people they are the metabolism is\ndifferent they\nstore relatively less glycogen than\nhumans do in terms of total metabolism\nso they\novernight within 12 to 14 hours the rer\nrespiratory exchange ratio or this ratio\nwill go from one when the consuming\nmostly glucose or carbohydrate as energy\nsource it will slow down slowly go to\n0.7.75\nit's after 12 to 14 hours they're kind\nof mostly running on fat\nso now as we give them food\num within 10 or 15 minutes they are not\nactually consuming couple of grams of\nfood they might have consumed say 100 or\n200 milligram of that child so which is\nless than say five percent of the food\nand then the rer will immediately begin\nto rise as if\nthat small amount of food stopped that\nfat burning process and cranked up the\ncarbohydrate burning process when you\nsay fat burning process you mean body\nfat stores being burned right not\ndietary fat correct yeah so it's all\nbody fat means that that's why I said um\nwe don't know where that fat is being\nburned because we are just measuring how\nhow much mice is breathing in and out\num so for example it can be from the\nSkin So subcutaneous fat or belly fat\nbut not dietary fat no by that time the\ndietary fat is already absorbed and\ndigested and hopefully it's sitting in\nthe liver or adipose tissue somewhere\nbut it's the fattest body fat yes thank\nyou yeah the reason I ask is that\nnowadays I think more than half of the\nbattles about nutrition that I see\nonline relate to this issue where I\nwon't name names but someone will come\nalong and say low carbohydrate diet\nallows you to burn more fat\nand the more nuanced people out there\nwill will say well that's true but\nyou're also talking about dietary fat\nyou know the word fat can confuse people\nI realize you're not doing that you are\ncertainly not one of the people guilty\nof doing this but indeed you eat more\nfat you'll burn more fat but that\ndoesn't mean you'll burn more body fat\nin fact I think the day does say that\nunder conditions of caloric restriction\nyou'll actually burn less I hope I don't\nI'll probably get I'll probably get um\npitchforks uh through the mail toward me\non on that one but but I think that's\ntrue whereas you know people who consume\ncarbohydrate can still burn body fat\neven though the majority of the fuel\nthey're burning is from carbohydrates so\nyeah so here in this case for example\nfrom mice we know that as soon as they\nstart eating\num the area goes up\ncoming back to your question what would\nbe ideal for us to do the experiment\nwould be okay so we'll go back to that\nand then give the mouse maybe 100\nmilligram of food\nand Mouse runs around in the case and\nthen we'll continue to measure to see\nhow long it takes for the mouse to come\nback and then\nso that's one husband so now let's say\num\nlet's stay on this and then I'll come\nback and talk about non-caloric food and\nwhether that is considered\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nso there is a famous experiment that was\npublished last year by jotakahasi Islam\nand it came out in science\nand that relates to caloric restriction\nand\nwe kind of started with this idea we\nstarted to discuss on that the rat\nexperiments were done with caloric\nrestriction and researchers get reduced\ncalorie consumption by 20 or 30 percent\nand get that food the rats and then\nsubsequently mice and they all lived\nlonger\nwhat is interesting is\nin all those experiments the researchers\ncame and gave this bolus of food at one\ntime whereas the adlibitum FED mice or\nrats they had access to food all the\ntime so they're eating all the time and\nthen these rats were given 20 percent\nless\nand what happens is this mice or rats\nthen I'm going to take that less food\nwhich is restaurant now and just eat\nlittle bit of lunch and then snack after\nthree hours or snack after three hours\nthey double up all that food within two\nto three hours maximum four hours food\nis gone so they're sort of on the omad\ndiet the one meal a day yeah they're\nalmost like in one meal a day three to\nfour hours food is gone\nor you can sit there on\nfour hours eating or feeding and 20\nhours fasting\num so then the question became well\nthe benefit of caloric restriction as we\nknow is it due to reduced calorie\nor\ntime restricted feeling or timing there\nis a timing component to it that they\nare eating all of that within three to\nfour hours and then there is a long\nfasting and this is a difficult question\nto answer because now\nyou have to ask this poor grad students\nor technicians to come and split that\nfood into eight or ten or fifteen\ndifferent small portions and then give\nthem to mice in every two hours\nwho actually published the first paper\nin 2017 showing that most caloric\nrestrictions I mean he used the protocol\nthat was used by Kelly restriction field\nit actually creates a condition of time\nrestriction\nso he saw that and then he went back and\nworked with Engineers to come up with\nthe smart kids where\nhe could actually tell he could program\nhow much food is given to mice at what\ntime of the day or night completely\nprogrammed\nso then he took this uh for example\nsuppose say the adlibitum FED mice it's\nfive grams of ciao in a day\nand if you want to reduce calories by uh\n20 percent and the CR Mouse should get\nfour grams of food\nand it divided this into\n9 or 10 meals and then give them in\nevery 90 minutes so in this case they're\neating small\nmeals\nthroughout day and night so there is no\nfasting so you can say that well this\nmouse actually is not getting into\nfasting because in every few hours is\ngetting some food\nand then he measured how long the mouse\nis going to live\num and he used\num accountments this is a very standard\nprotocol people count how many mice have\ndying on which day and then examine them\nto see whether they've died because they\nthere was an accident or they actually\nthere was a natural cause\nand then they calculate at the end what\nis the half life so 50 survival because\nthat's on an average that's a good\nindicator because if there is an outlier\nthat will live for a long time then that\ncan skew\nso what was interesting was the limit\nunfair mice of course they live certain\nnumber of days and then this\ncaloric restricted mice\nthat never got into Super fasting but\nkind of eating snacking throughout day\nand night that also lift 10 percent\nextra 10 percent longer so that means\ncaloric restriction extended lifespan by\n10 percent I've wondered about this\nbecause recently\nyou know there's been there were a bunch\nof news headlines about intermittent\nfasting and and frankly I was frustrated\nif you looked at one major news outlet\nthey would say time restricted feeding\naffords no additional benefit Beyond\ncaloric restriction for weight loss yeah\nthen another\npopular press venue let's call it that\nsame study described as time restricted\nfeeding\ndoesn't work yeah right and then another\none maybe someplace\num even more extreme you know time\nrestricted feeding\num only beneficial because of caloric\nrestriction or something like that so\nwhat you've essentially got are three\ndifferent interpretations of the same\ndata all of which are well two of which\nare true one of which is false in my\nopinion but what I think people take\naway from that is oh time restricted\nfeeding isn't valuable which is not the\ncase it I think for many people it's a\nconvenient way to eat because at least\nfor people like me it's simpler to\ndesignate between portions of my day\nwhen I'm eating and portions of day my\nday when I'm not eating as opposed to\neating portion control for other people\nportion control can work but all of that\nis related to either maintenance or loss\nof weight none of it deals with the\npotential health benefits independent of\nweight loss yeah right so um and so I I\nthink that um if we can segment those\nout\num obviously in humans it's hard to know\nif a given treatment or experiment is\nextending life because you don't really\nknow how long people would live anyway\nyeah right whereas with mice you have\nsome sense of when the mortality was\nlikely to occur so what can we say about\ntime restricted feeding and longevity in\nterms of biomarkers or in terms of any\nother indication that people who start\nand stop their feeding window at a\nconsistent time somewhere between 8 and\n12 hours per 24 hour cycle are\ntilting the scales towards living longer\nas opposed to living shorter this\nexample of this news article that you\nmentioned is really interesting because\nthat relates to Joe's Joe takas's study\nbecause I described that if you split\ncalories and eat throughout the day\nthroughout day and night then the mice\nlived 10 percent extra\nbut if you now give Mouse the same\ncaloric restricted diet\nand fit them during day time\nwhether within 12 hours or two hours\nthen the mice lived 10 percent extra\nbeyond that yes so twenty percent so\nokay so let me make sure I understand so\nthat uh so that I make sure I understand\nif you take a certain number of calories\nand you distribute them throughout the\n24-hour cycle yeah\nit's caloric restriction the mice will\nlive ten percent longer yeah if you\nhowever restrict that to the active\ncycle of the so for humans the daytime\nthen\n20 then they live 20 percent long twenty\npercent so it's not just total caloric\nintake yeah meaning it's not just\nimportant to be sub maintenance and\ncalories for sacral longevity it also is\nimportant as to when in the 24 hour\ncycle yeah you eat those calories do I\nhave that right so now\nthat's still the story is not over\nbecause this mice were fed during\ndaytime and they're not supposed to eat\nthat's right so for us it will be the\nequivalent of being on the night shift\nand only eating at night but a sub color\nsub maintenance calorie diet I guess is\nthe right way to say it but when he fed\nmice during night time when they're\nsupposed to eat and they're seeing this\ngetting the same number of calories\nwithin 12 hours or two hours\nthen the mice left 35 percent longer\nthan they control 35 longer so scale to\nhuman lifespan which you know we don't\nknow but but a 35 longer would mean that\num and again no one knows but um humans\nnow what is the average mortality in the\nUnited States\nyeah so it's around 80 it used to be 18\nhours slow uh reduce little bit because\nof covet but let's take 80 okay so\npeople are then now living somewhere\nbetween 25 and 35 years longer but I'm\nputting some error bars on yeah yeah so\nthat was um really profound but now you\npointed out um biomarker and other stuff\nso now\nif you look at any given time within\nthat experiment and actually Joe went\nback and\num had a separate cohort of mice very\nsimilar and so that he could take tissue\nsamples and of course in this case you\nhave to sacrifice the mouse\nand he looked for\num he did a lot of molecular analysis\nwith non markers for example hemoglobin\nA1c equivalent or glucose control\ncholesterol all this stuff\nhe could not find anything\n[Music]\nthat predicted the benefit of caloric\nrestriction so that means in this\nexperiment whatever we know so far the\npredictor of longevity none of them\ncould predict whether this\num\nCR only Mouse which throughout day and\nnight\nthat Mouse is going to live less than\nthe night fed mouse that was going to\nlive 35 25 extra does that mean that\nthere are biomarkers related to\nlongevity that we just haven't\ndiscovered yet yeah so that's exactly so\nthat means whatever we know so far about\nbiomarkers those\nhe could not use to predict maybe there\nwas a lot of noise maybe he wanted he\nhad to use more number of mice to get\nthat because you know biomarkers\nare not going to predict in every\ninstance so there is some error\nwhat is also very interesting is if you\nlook at the body weight and body\ncomposition of all these mice there is\nno difference in body weight and body\ncomposition\nacross all these differences all these\ngroups so it doesn't matter when they\nate yeah provided they were submit sub\nmaintenance calorie intake so less\nfewer calories than is required to\nmaintain their weight didn't matter what\npattern of eating they were the same way\nyeah so that in many ways seems to mimic\nthe human studies where they say look it\ndoesn't really matter whether or not you\nuse caloric restriction or or you start\nyour feeding window in the morning or\nstart your feeding window in the evening\nor you\num or you portion control for sake of\nweight contr weight loss because you're\ntaking a snapshot of that and then\nanother thing with the human study that\nwe are referring to here\num that in that human study\npeople are actually already eating\nwithin 10 hours window\nhabitually when they selected these\npeople to have them enroll in the study\nso they were already eating for 10 hours\nand fasting for 14 hours\nall participants had to reduce that\ncaloric intake and they reduced by\nalmost 25 percent\nthe CR group continued with 10 hour\nsitting window\nand the CR plus time restricted group\nhad to eat the same number of calories\nwithin eight hours so it's just a two\nhour difference it's just a two hours\ndifference okay so that people I just\nwant to make sure people can understand\nso in this human study which is the one\nthat I felt that the popular press\nvenues all except one venue\num got either semi-rung or badly wrong\nin terms of their conclusion that was my\ninterpretation anyway was that\neither people came into the study eating\nbasically in a 10 hour feeding window\nwhich goes back to my first question\nwhich is that most people are not eating\nin the middle of the night yeah or if\nthey're on shift work and they are then\nthey're sleeping during the day anyway\nso they're eating in a 10 to 12 hour\nfeeding window anyway so you're saying\nthey either did caloric restriction\nportion control within the 10-hour\nwindow or another group within the study\neight sub maintenance calories so\ncaloric restriction CR as we're calling\nit the acronym CR but restricted to that\nto an eight hour feeding window and they\ndidn't see any difference in terms of\nweight loss yeah but but it's not all\nthat surprising right I mean if it's\njust a two-hour difference yeah exactly\nso we have done that experiment in mice\nand we don't see\num difference in not only weight loss\nmany other markers and I was telling you\nabout this um paper where I told you\nthat he allowed this mice to eat within\ntwo hours or 12 hours\nsub calories diet 2 or 12 2 or 12. yeah\nthat's dramatic but still he did not see\nchange in longevity even within those\ntwo so that means\num when you do caloric restriction and\nthen at least for months and you are\nwithin 12 hours window\num that's that is giving the mice the\nbest benefit the optimum benefit and\num two three or five or twelve per Mouse\ndoesn't matter at least for longevity\ncan we conclude for humans that whether\nor not a feeding window is\nfour hours six hours eight hours or 12\ndoesn't matter provided that calories\nare are similar or same well I won't go\nto that extent because we don't know\nmany of this particularly we don't know\nhow this sort of eating window will\naffect both success because you know we\nalways think many of this mouse\nexperiments even that I told you about\nthose are done only in Mel mice but that\nshould be changing right because the NIH\nI know this because I'm on study section\nwhich is just a bunch of people who\nrecord who review grants is that every\nGrant now has to include sex as a\nbiological variable it's hard to get\naway with\num or rather I should say it the way it\nshould be said which is people are\nrequired\nand should want to look at these\nphenomena in male and female mice yes\nespecially if there are differences so\nin this case\num there are many I mean there is also\nanother paper\num in time history repeating that also\ncame out a big paper showing that they\num thermogenesis was accounting for loss\nin fat mass and time just to referred\nmice that was also done only in male\nmice\num so this is um we are paying attention\nto it so we are now doing all of our\nstudies in male and female and we do see\nbig differences between male and female\ncoming back to humans\nwhat typically happens is when you're\ntrying to do four hours or six hours of\ntime restricting people will\ninadvertently reduce their caloric\nintake yeah just because of gut volume I\ntried one meal per day and and I felt\nlike I was eating so much at that one\nsitting yeah that it led to a lot of\ngastric distress and I got tired after\nthe meal and part of the reason I like\nto do time restricted feeding is I have\nmore energy yeah and certainly in the\nfasted State I feel more energized\nespecially if I'm ingesting a little\ncaffeine or something like that\num so people will reduce\num\nenergy intake and then\nsome people who are more active they can\nactually\nunconsciously they may be spending more\nenergy in their physical activity and\nbasal metabolic rate all of this\ncombined than homozy eating\nand that can have a very adverse effect\nin long term because we know that this\nenergy deficit and in fact there is a\nscientific term for that it's called red\ns relative energy deficit in sports\nenergy deficit in sports okay yeah it's\nbecause nearly 40 percent of athletes\num not the NFL guys but you know a lot\nof people who do track and field\num and nearly 40 percent of athletes\nactually experience this Reds red S\nwithout knowing can male and female\nathletes both men remains Reds so it's\nReds Reds relative energy relative\nenergy deficit in sports interesting is\nthe first I've heard this acronym we\nhave a new acronym folks this is good to\nadd to it a list of other acronyms but I\nso males and females can experience it\nso in females I've heard that\num Reds\num can lead to uh eminaria so loss of of\nmen's of the menstrual cycle yeah so\nthat's uh so common that uh so prevalent\nthat in fact many women many female\nathletes they take it for granted that\nyes if they are more active then they\nwill lose their menstrual cycle which is\nwhich may be common but it's not normal\nor Optimum per health\nand even if they don't want to get\npregnant yeah yeah yeah yeah we had an\nexpert on female hormones come on and\nsay the very same thing that regular\ncycling is a is very important of\novulatory menstrual cycle is is\nimportant to try and\num maintain yeah yeah so that's one but\nthen what is really concerning is\num it does affect bone health\nand\num in this state people actually over a\nlong period of time the loose bone mass\nand the bone also becomes more prone to\ninjury micro fracture and fractures\num so again it's a risk means if some\npeople are trying to eat within very\nshort time and they're Physically Active\nthat happens and it also has impact on\nmeans the reason why\nthese women are losing menstrual cycle\nis the\nhpg axis is disrupted hypothalamus\npituitary\ngonadal axis\nand it starts it may start again\nUpstream at hypothalamus or pituitary so\nthat means that HPA axis hypothalamus\npituitary and adrenal axis may also get\ndisrupted one of the symptoms of Reds is\nalso depression anxiety bipolar like\nsymptoms and we know that many\num many athletes experience that we\nthink that well this this may be just\npeer pressure that always trying to\ncompete and we know that I'm\nunfortunately there are few authors who\njust can't cope it and there are many\nattempted suicide or suicide so this is\na serious issue and\nthere's also another new topic in the\nlab to come up with a mouse model of\nReds and then study it but this is one\nrisk why we should not reduce our eating\ninterval to two such to one meal or very\nshort time because it can have adverse\nside effects that we don't know now\num maybe in future we'll figure out when\nwe systematically study them\nthere are studies that are published\nshowing four hours and six hours time\nrestricted eating has benefits on weight\nloss but those are on healthy\nindividuals and they were in the studies\nso the um you know the study team took a\nuh well already monitoring the mature\nthat there was no sudden weight loss or\nweight loss below\num some safety level uh so those are\nvery different from regular people who\nare who maybe even normal weight or even\nwith uh within the healthy range if they\ndo then they can potentially so that's\nwhy\nwhat we think is eight to ten hours\nmaybe the ideal spot to begin with and\num once you are physically active and\nyou are also spending a lot of energy in\nphysical activity or Sports you can even\ngo up to 12 hours because in mice we\nhave done that experiment\num after 12 hours they do get a lot of\nbenefits not all but so this is 12 hours\nof 12 hours of feeding 12 hours of\nfasting yeah\num in humans\num again nobody has done systematically\n12 hours but there is one study in\nEurope\num from tin High Colette lab and Tin\nhigh and I we collaborate so they used\nour my security and clock app this is a\nresearch app we developed just to this\nis mostly used in time restricted eating\nstudies\nand he had nearly I think he started\nwith 200 Swiss participants but then at\nthe end he selected and took very small\nnumber of groups people who are very\num meticulous about recording all their\nfood and divided them into usual feeling\nwhatever they wanted to eat whenever\nthey wanted to eat and they were given\nthe advice of Swiss nutrition advice\nthat's given to improved health and\nreduce blood glucose almost like\ndiabetes prevention program in the U.S\nand then the other group was given\nadvice to eat within 12 hours\nthis is very early on in time\nrestorating and we thought that the mice\nwere getting some benefit let's try with\nthe 12 hours has any benefit\nthe bottom line is\nat the end of three months and six\nmonths what he reported is both groups\nlost same amount of body weight\nand then there's not too much\nsignificant difference between groups\nbut both groups actually improved their\nhealth so the bottom line is the Swiss\nnutritional advice that he was giving\nWhich is the standard of care there it\nachieved the same amount of weight loss\nas just giving people this advice that\neat within 12 hours so one way to look\nat it look at the result is like this\nand\nthen he went to more extent and actually\nlooked at every single meal these people\nconsumed so they're close to I think\nclose to 60 or 70 000 meal records and\npictures he went through and then\nclassified them to say whether these are\ngood quality food so they call it the\nNova classification one two three four\none is the food that you can almost eat\nraw fruits vegetables\num yogurt and dairy products that you\ncan almost without any preparation\nand then second Nova 2 is kind of home\nhome cooked food that most people will\nprepare in few minutes and then three\nand then fourth one is the food that you\ncan never prepare at home\nso for example\nbiscuit or cookies that we usually\npurchase and few other things\nand usually the Nova 4 are unhealthy\nUltra processed food so which we should\nnot be eating so the advice is to reduce\nNovak for\nand what I found was people who got all\nthis advice\num to improve their nutrition quality\nthey actually improve their nutrition\nquality they reduce their Nova for food\nand people who were in time frustrating\nthe eight within 12 hours they did not\nchange the nutrition quality\nbut what is interesting is they both got\nthe same modest weight loss so that begs\nthe question that in the maybe tin high\nwill do this experiment again to combine\nnutrition advice with time restriction\nand maybe reduce the time to 10 hours\nand that might help\num so\n12 hours is something that I say\nanyone from five-year-old to 100 year\nold can do and if you are trying to\nmaintain weight that might be a good way\nand combine that with exercise it'll be\ngreat and and people can more easily\navoid Reds in that way women and for\nnon-athletes or recreational exercises\nsounds like women\nif they distribute their calories across\n12 hours are less likely to lose their\nmenstrual cycle yeah so again this is\nsomething that we have to look carefully\nthey have to be because\nwe do have the my security and clock app\nthat many people download and\nself-monitor and they share the data for\nresearchers we won't provide a link to\nthat by the way it's a great it's a\ngreat tool yeah but once in a while we\ndo get this input from some women saying\noh I started doing your Timeless routing\nand I I'm seeing all these problems and\nthen I ask them okay so what else are\nyou doing they're typically improve the\nnutrition quality so they're eating only\nsalad and few and they're trying to\nincrease the fiber intake and it's\nreally hard to eat so much of uncooked\nfood because cooking helps to absorb\nmore nutrient and then at the same time\nthey're running five miles every day and\nof course all of this combinedly can\nlead to Reds like symptom so that's why\n12 I think is a good point if you're\ncombining physical exercise and better\nnutrition quality because in mice also\nwe have seen that if mice are eating\nhealthy food and they're eating within\n10 to 12 hours then they also live\nlonger than mice that writing healthy\nfood but Distributing that calorie over\na long period of time and this is um\nRafa di cabbage\nfinding from NIH he has systematically\ndone this study with two different types\nof diet and in mice and he finds the\nsame thing that even mice that are\neating within 12 hours they do live\nlonger than mice that eat randomly even\nhealthy food\nI I recall a recent study I think it was\neither published in cell reports or cell\nreports medicine forgive me for not\nremembering which we'll both of course\ncell press journals excellent journals\nwhich explored time-restricted feeding\nin the context of low carbohydrate or\nnon-low carbohydrate diet so it was low\ncarbohydrate versus low carbohydrate and\ntime restricted yeah so these all\ncaloric matched right between groups and\nthen non low carbohydrate diets those\nare more standard uh I think it was\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 60 of\ncalories from complex carbohydrates and\nand as I recall the um the greatest\nweight loss\nremember same calories across groups\nfolks\num was achieved with low carbohydrate\nplus caloric restriction yeah\num and I wondered why all the popular\nnews venues didn't cover that study um\nbut that's why I'm bringing it up now I\nthought this is really interesting and\num and I'm somebody who's cycled low\ncarbohydrate diet\num before I find it hard to sleep after\nabout three or four days of being on a\nlow starch yeah diet just personally I\nso I like to eat some starches yeah\nespecially if exercising intensely or\nworking intensely that's just a little\neditorial there that\num but look I know many people who do\njust feel better on a low carbohydrate\ndiet but what do you think of those data\nbecause it speaks to the idea that okay\nit's not just the total number of\ncalories it's not just the quality of\nthose calories\nit's the timing of those calories and\nmaybe carbohydrate restriction in\nconjunction with\ntime restricted feeding might be the\nbest path for people who are looking to\nlose weight\nno I I totally agree that when it comes\nto nutrition quality quantity and timing\nall these three matter nearly 40 percent\nof people who maintain healthy body\nweight because sixty percent are\noverweight and rupees 40 percent of\nmaintaining healthy body weight and out\nof those 40 I would say nearly majority\nof them\nare very aware about how much dieting\nand what quality of food they're eating\nso you're really an optimist you're\nlooking at the 40 of the glass that's uh\nor should we say not full\nthere was a pun intended but the um no\nit's a very interesting way of looking\nat rather than saying you know why or 60\nof Americans obese uh saying why are 40\nnot obese that's a very interesting way\nto look at it yeah I mean um\nsubconsciously we're always making the\ndecision inside no means I'm sure that\nyou are not going and eating um\ncheeseburger every day because\num you want to improve yeah right no\nyeah exactly I wouldn't feel good yeah I\nenjoy a cheeseburger now and again but I\num no not certainly not this stage or\nany stage of my life I think that\num\nI think people\nactually you think the pandemic had a\nlot to do with this I think that people\nstarted to take a look at what they were\ndoing to support or not support their\nhealth generally yeah I know people\ngained a lot of weight during the\npandemic other people got really into\nfitness I've seen some colleagues but\nyou've always maintained\num you've always been in good shape\nactually the first time I've seen you in\na while you've seem to have aged\nbackwards so you are a poster uh for\nyour own um ideas and hypotheses about\ntime restricted feeding but but I um I\nnoticed that during the pandemic a\nnumber of people emerged from the\npandemic in better shape other people in\nmuch worse shape it seemed like it was a\nit was like a bimodal distribution there\nyeah\num\nso yeah I get the sense that starting\nand stopping eating at more or less the\nsame time each day even if caloric\nrestriction is not the main focus yeah\nhas additional benefits\num\ncan we talk about some of those benefits\nas they relate to the other things that\nimpact health so for instance if you're\nstarting and stopping eating at more or\nless the same times each day are you\nsleeping better are you getting more\npredictable\nuh shifts in alertness and sleepiness\nlike can you predict when you'll feel\ngood enough to exercise yeah maybe we\ncould talk about that because you of\ncourse\num are well known for time restricted\nfeeding and the science around that but\nalso other things as well\num not the least of which is circadian\nbiology generally so I always think of\nthe main timekeepers for our system\nbeing feeding light\nactivity and social connection did I\nmiss maybe temp and temperature yeah\nyeah so how do these combine with one\nanother and using timing that we begin\nand stop feeding is kind of an anchor\nPoint can we explore that a little bit\nyeah so you know we got into this\num beginning and end and then we\nyou asked for the calorie how much\ncalorie will break the fast\num\none thing that I want the listeners and\nviewers to\nbring back to this timing of when wait\nwhen you're breaking the fast because we\nequate Health with weight body weight\nand\nthat's when you know we are talking\nabout nutrition quality and quantity\nbecause both of them have impact\nso now let's think about mental health\nbecause a lot of people\ndo struggle with mental health they have\nanxiety or depression\nand also\num it's a gut health because there are a\nlot of people who also have acid reflux\nor heartburn\nand we know that acid reflux or\nheartburn can be exacerbated by caffeine\nintake in empty stomach\nthose who have acid reflux of heartburn\nthey're prone to that then having black\ncoffee in the morning\nbefore any food\num Can upset their stomach so that's why\nin those cases it's very clearly that\ncaffeine for them becomes the trigger\nand that's something the food is\nsupposed to come and then the stomach is\nnot seeing the food so it's overreacting\nproducing excess acid and that comes up\nto the esophagus and that's what they're\nexperiencing\nso if people have that kind of condition\nthen maybe they should consider when\nthey drink their first coffee is\nbreaking their\noverall fast or kind of putting them\nputting their health at risk for acid\nreflux\nthe other thing is people who have\nanxiety panic attack we know that\ncaffeine can judge you up especially on\nan empty stomach especially on an empty\nstomach so for them again\ncaffeine can be a trigger so that's why\nI want to kind of differentiate that\nthere is this mental health and other\naspects of health and these are two\nclear examples where anxiety panic\nattack related to brain health\nor acid reflux related to our gut health\nin those cases\nwhen we consume that caffeine in the\nmorning can affect so do you avoid\ncaffeine in the morning no actually here\nis the interesting history about\ncaffeine and this is something I did not\nknow and I was once invited to this\nhistory of nighttime activity and maybe\nwe can take a little bit of detour and\ntalk about night time activity because\nthat fascinates me as a circadian\nbiologist\nbecause over the last 200 000 years\nmeans we assume that humans Homo sapiens\nevolved 200 000 years ago so we have\nbeen as a species we have been living on\nthis planet for 200 000 years\nand only in the last\nyou can say a couple of thousand or five\nthousand years when we came to control\nfire or maybe you can even go back to\n100 000 years there is some debate\num so then the question is well\nwhen you control fire and we light it up\nthe fire\nand we could light up whenever we wanted\nwe can add Fuel and we can stop the fire\nwhen we don't want it\nthat's the key\nability in humans that differentiates\nthem from all the other spaces\nno other species we can always say yes\nthere are signs of this intelligent\ndecision making for example we know many\ncrows can make decisions many many\nanimals they kind of figure out\nstrategize how to get food but\ncontrolled use of fire is something very\nspecific to Human\nand when we started\num controlling fire fire did not\nessentially extend the day\nbecause fire created a evening that is\nvery different from what people did\nduring the day\nand what people used to do during day\nthey worked a lot means Gathering food\nwas almost everything that we did\nand so in the evening after the after\nthe after we brought food mostly tubers\nor maybe lentils to cook or once in a\nwhile animals so that we can we could\nbarbecue\num all of these things happen around\nFire and Fire was so expensive that it\nwas mostly communal fire so if you go\nback to for example Maasai and all this\nand such sorry\npopulations that have no access to\nelectricity and are still living kind of\nthat historical life\nfire is a communal event and they sat\naround the cooked food and then what\nhappened\nthey did not talk about work they talked\nabout\num culture they told the sang the danced\nthey strategize\num that's how politics started\nphilosophy started science started all\nof this things that are very unique to\nhuman civilization started around\nfireside chat\nso\num in that way if we think about it we\nare still doing fireside chat the only\nthing is we have the microwave and the\ntelevision or social media so now we\nchat with our thumbs right so it's still\nso we are hooked to that evening\nactivity because that's when\nwe are completely free from the pressure\nof the work and we want to express\nourselves that's our independent kind so\nthat's why\nmost people find it very difficult to do\ntime resulting and stop eating at six\no'clock because it's in Grand in our in\nour even DNA that we want to eat and\nsocialize in the evening\nso now let's fast forward and see what\nis the roll of coffee in this and if you\nlook at Coffee consumption particularly\nCafe where people can come and have\nlittle bit of coffee and socialize it\nalso started as an evening activity and\nthis is an\num now we can go back to Istanbul\nbecause that's one place where Coffee\nCafe is started in mid 16th century so\nwe are talking about 15 40 to 1570\num and that's when uh\nI'm sorry I'm forgetting the name of\nhistorians who actually invited me and\nuh okay his name is\nI must be butchering the name but I'll\ntry to provide the spelling and the\nwonderful thing about social media is\nsomebody will tell us on YouTube the\nproper pronunciation so it's a great\nopportunity if you know the proper\npronunciation please put it in the\ncomments on YouTube I'm actually I'm\neven checking right now in my endnote\nlibrary it's not picking up that that's\nright we'll provide a link yeah so what\nhappened was\num so coffee was introduced and\num people came and drank coffee and\ntalked about politics at night at night\nat evening and it actually started with\nwith Sufi branch of Islam because they\nare the ones who uh consumed coffee in\nthe evening and this is the branch of\nIslam where they actually sing and dance\nand all that happened in the evening\nso singing dancing\nby the stupid and then here in Istanbul\npeople started congregating and having\num talk about politics\nbut then around the same time\num some you know\nin Turkey there was a good sizable\nnumber of Muslims who have to do five\nprayers a day number of prayers at set\ntime the first prayer is very early in\nthe morning\nand then they figured out that if they\nwake up and immediately have coffee then\nthey can stay awake for the first prayer\nand in that way they felt pretty good\nand they woke up I said that's how it\nstarted as a morning drink to stay awake\nand kind of get get on with the day\nbut what happened was I don't know\nwhether you have ever tried Turkish\ncoffee it's very thick\nyeah a few years ago right before the\npandemic 2019 I traveled to Turkey is\nfirst of all the food is amazing the\ncoffee is indeed very very thick yeah\nand\nI have a pretty high caffeine tolerance\nyeah\num from drinking so much coffee in yerba\nmate over the years and still do I\nreally enjoy it but um yeah it's it's\nvery intense and so what you're saying\nis that\num\ncoffee intake started as a way to extend\ninto the night the ability to extend\ninto the night at all was because of the\nability to harness fire and then coffee\nstimulatory properties were\nleverage toward morning\nwhich is essentially like the way I\nthink about it we did an episode on\ncaffeine and some uh someone else\nMichael Paul and not I described it this\nway that you're sort of taking a loan\nout on your energy bank account with\ncoffee you're suppressing the adenosine\nsystem the density makes you sleepy but\nthat adenosine system will kick in later\nso you're you're it's a credit card of\nsorts with an interest right right and\nthe interest being\num an energetic lag that you're going to\nexperience in the afternoon yeah but\nwhat happened was with the strong coffee\num that gave heartburn and acid reflux\nto a lot of people\nso then\nthey started eating something with\ncoffee and that's how the culture of\nbreakfast started in Turkey ah so coffee\nactually led to the development of\nbreakfast not the other way around and\nthat uh yeah so that's very heartening\nuh no again no pun intended uh for the\nuh the caffeine lovers Among Us uh which\nI count myself one of those so\nessentially the food before coffee\nbecame breakfast so you kind of\ngive something to your to your stomach\nso it's busy digesting that and then\nwhen the coffee comes in it's not\nreacting to coffee and creating\num acid reflux so it wasn't this\nfascinating so it wasn't that breakfast\nis necessary on its own it was\nessentially a buffer against the gastric\ndistress caused by caffeine at least in\nthat culture when in that context\num we cannot say that whether the same\nthing happened in all over the world\nwhere coffee is not consumed but still\npeople eat something in the morning you\nsaid you start your um first meal uh of\nthe day at around eight what time do you\nwake up I wake up around six if I\nstarted to six what time do you have\nyour first caffeine no actually I have\nso that's why I brought up this story\nbecause I have coffee after my breakfast\nfantastic I'm a big proponent of\ndelaying caffeine intake for a few hours\nafter waking for other reasons that my\nlisteners have heard me talk about\nendlessly so I won't bother with that\nnow but I think um\nallowing the suffice to say that\nallowing some of the natural waking up\nsignals to occur and using light to kind\nof clear away and adenosine to further\nextend an activity is better than using\na stimulant but until a few hours later\nthis is fascinating because I've never\nthought about the link between extension\ninto the night socialization or\nsocializing rather feeding and caffeine\nI'd like to take a brief break and thank\nour sponsor inside tracker inside\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nanalyzed from a quality blood test the\nproblem with a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there however is that you get\ndata back about metabolic factors lipids\nand hormones and so forth but you don't\nknow what to do with those data inside\ntracker solves that problem and makes it\nvery easy for you to understand what\nsorts of nutritional behavioral maybe\neven supplementation based interventions\nyou might want to take on in order to\nadjust the numbers of those metabolic\nfactors hormones lipids and other things\nthat impact your immediate and long-term\nHealth to bring those numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate and indeed\noptimal for you if you'd

promotion of\nthe Year again if you go to\ninsidetracker.com huberman you can get\n31 off their ultimate plan now actually\nI'm kind of\num speaking what many other researchers\nhave found and this this particularly\nthis fireside chat I'm forgetting again\nthe name of the scientist I think is\nfrom University of Washington Seattle\nshe went to Africa and kind of recorded\nwhat people are talking of course you\ncould not understand what they were\ntalking Twitter and whether or not\nTesla's stock is going up of course no\nno just just kidding folks and then came\nback and tried to translate and then\nfigured out that what they're talking\nduring daytime and in the evening were\nvery different so\num so so\nuh what are they talking about at night\nso exactly so this is like they're\ntalking about matchmaking and talking\nabout politics and strategizing to\ngather food or or\neven singing and dancing uh so this is\num if you think if we think about it how\nwe manage\nsunset\nto our bedtime\nwhat we do between Sunset and bedtime\naffects most of our health\nI'm going to think about that for a\nmoment I totally agree\num and by the way I'm a huge\nbeliever and and I'm in living in great\nhope for the idea that\nright now I do think that scientists\nunderstand a lot more about the\ndifferent stages of sleep slow wave\nsleep REM sleep Etc then we do active\nwaking States like we talk about being\nfocused or being alert but that's not\nthose aren't scientific terms as we know\nbut I do\nbelieve and I've noticed a distinct\ndifference between the first\neight hours of the day in terms of\ncognition and we know that the\ncatecholamines are at much higher levels\nplus court is also dopamine cortisol\nepinephrine all of that is really at\nmuch higher levels than in the later\nevening\nand so this evening time it all it's\ncertainly in the context of mental\nhealth we know that morning and evening\nwe are basically different creatures\nyeah yeah\nso that's why I think in the evening if\nyou think about it um\nagain this is uh again another set of\nresearch from\num my good friend Horacio who the\nIglesias yeah oh yeah yeah I'm a big fan\nof horacio's another he's a fellow\nArgentine so occasionally we riff about\nthings related to that but he's a\nwonderful biologist are you guys\ncollaborating yeah his kind of uh I say\nhe's very humble and it's a low profile\nbut he does amazing amazing research\ntotally agree he does research that um\nwe want to know but nobody is ready to\ndo it because field research is very\ndifficult to go to the Wilderness or go\nto the places where there is no\nelectricity and then record\num when these people are eating sleeping\nor in this case activity exposure to\nlight that's what Horacio has done and\nuh it was this active watch which is\nkind of a modern\nactivity tracker\num but it's a little bit more refined\nbecause it also collects light\ninformation\nwhat I found was most of these\nArgentinian Towers who have no access to\nelectricity\nthey consistently go to bed somewhere\nbetween three to three and a half hours\nafter Sunset so this is very important\nbecause we always think that\num our ancestors when they didn't have\nelectricity as soon as the sun went down\nthey just went to sleep no\nthe fire extended the evening so they\nwere staying awake for three to four\nhours\nkind of\num you know\ndecompressing themselves that we say and\nthen doing all these activities cooking\nsharing meals and then they would go to\nsleep\nand if you look at the slip onset\nvariability it was very small like\nthey're going to bed almost within 15 to\n30 minutes standard deviation so no\nnight owls versus morning people exactly\nso we'll get to that none of this this\nuh I get attacked by for many reasons it\njust goes with the business I'm in of\nbeing public facing these days but every\ntime I talk about viewing sunrise or low\nangle sunlight you know getting some\nsunlight earlier someone says well I'm a\nnight owl and they just it's almost like\na a protest of trying to protect\nidentity it's become this ideological I\nI identity related thing I'm a night owl\nI'm a morning person and I'm not but\nyou're telling me that in these cultures\nwhere there is intellectricity but there\nis fire people are going to sleep within\nall of them within about 15 minutes of\none another yeah so there is no such\nthing as a night owl or a morning person\nin the context I still actually I asked\nhim pointedly because uh uh and then he\nsaid no he has not sinned and says\ndragged hundreds of people and if we ask\nthere are many many sleep researchers or\nat least the public facing sleep\nPhysicians or experts they will say yeah\nwe can say one third of people a night\nhour one third of morning and then one\nthird are in between but yeah they call\nthem like Bears wolves and you know and\nI'm not being disparaging of that idea I\nthink people really do feel as it as if\nthey Orient towards one pattern or\nanother when I was an undergrad student\nI never went to bed before midnight and\nactually midnight was my going to\nbedtime exactly like 11 45 I'll try to\nget ready to hit build and then by 12\nI'm in bed and I used to get up at six\nsix fifteen that's a pretty short sleep\nwith an alarm of course and but then day\ntime I used to take 45 minutes to one\nhour nap and that was regular\nlike even if uh whenever I got time of\ncourse in college you know you don't\nhave the whole debt unlike in high\nschool you don't have opportunity to nap\nbut in college you can I might have been\none of those kids with this hoodie on\nnapping on the desk but they come around\nand they wake you up yeah but in this\ncase just come back to the dorm and\num after lunch usually I used to take a\nnap\nso\num then in grad school\nI remember I rarely went to bed before 2\nam and I could have clearly said that\nI'm a night owl and actually I was a\nnight owl\nit was very comfortable staying up so\nlate I was very productive doing\nexperiments writing all this um\nmanuscripts mostly and\nbut then afterwards when I looked back\nin postdoc when I had when we had our\ndaughter\num then things started changing because\nyou have to\nput the baby to sleep\nand then after the baby sleeps it's\nalmost when you have a baby your life\nrevolves around the baby so then we have\nto dim down the light\nthere is no caffeine and alcohol\ndrinking or any other things after the\nbaby sleeps because we cannot do too\nmuch noise and others so then I realized\nthat no I'm actually not a night owl and\nI became kind of more normal because I\ncould go to sleep between 10 and 11.\nand\num that's how I thought well maybe this\nwas very unique to me\nbut what is interesting is\nI have another colleague good friend Ken\nWright Jr Colorado at Colorado and he\nalso had grad students and\num and postdocs like me who strongly\nbelieved that there were night owls\num just like everybody else\nand he took Ken took the whole Lab for\ncamping and when they were camping of\ncourse there is less light and a lot of\nphysical activity hiking during the day\nand they all went to bed between 9 and\n10 30 p.m I love that study yeah what\nSachin just described was a study I\nthink there were two studies uh there\nwere two yeah and um what's interesting\nas I recall is that after going camping\nfor a weekend where people awake with\nthis more or less with the sunrise yeah\nand go to sleep a few hours after Sunset\nyeah their melatonin rhythms and\ncortisol rhythms and sleep wake rhythms\npersisted on that schedule for several\nweeks despite returning to environments\nwhere there was a lot of artificial\nlighting which I find amazing that just\na weekend of consistent rising and um\ngoing to bed with the sunrise and sunset\nyeah more or less\nallowed a reset that was very long\nlasting yeah\nso\num actually even in Horatio study he\nfound that almost all the tobas they\nwake up around sunrise time and it's\namazing when I look at the standard\ndeviation it's like so tight\nso take that night owl so-called night\nowls I also in graduate school I would\nwork until 2 A.M I loved it I'd blast\nmusic in the lab everyone was at home\npretty much not everyone but there were\nthe the night crew and then I'd get in\nsometime around\nget up or sometime around 9 30 10 and\nthen get in around 11 and it was no\nproblem because I was going to stay so\nvery late and then over time I noticed\nI've become more locked to a standard\nschedule so I think what we're saying is\nthat the clock can our internal clocks\ncan shift yeah but this idea that we are\ngenetically\nbiased towards one schedule or another\nmay need revisiting that's what that's\nthe conclusion I'm taking from this a\ncouple of aspects one is um you know\nsome people are genetically so\npre-programmed because the other flip\nside is what is called technically\nfamilial Urban sleep Fest syndrome so\nthese people\num you can give them caffeine or\nwhatever but they will fall asleep say\nat eight o'clock they cannot stay awake\ntill nine or ten\nand since it's a very strong phenotype\nin sleep and circadian rhythm field they\nare very well studied so in fact Louis\npotashek and ingwifu they were the first\none to track one family like this and\nthen they figured out there was a\nmutation in one of the clock genes\nperiod two that clocked in and that\nmutation\num allowed the clock to run in a way\nthat these people went to bed very early\nI guess historically\ngiven these Fireside Chats those people\nwere probably not contributing much to\ntheir political discussion whatever that\nwas decided after they went to sleep is\nwhat they woke up into that reminds me\nbecause as you were describing the\ndifference between nighttime discussions\nversus morning discussions is there any\ntheme to what is discussed in the\nmorning versus in the nighttime where\npeople just sipping their eating and\nsipping their caffeine and just waking\nup\num but is there are there any ideas\nabout what morning discussions really\nconsistent morning discussions or\ndaytime discussions are mostly about\num work and like hunting Gathering or\nfarming all that stuff and even these\ndays that's what we do we you know you\ngo to I go to work and it's mostly one\nmeeting after another and we're talking\nabout how means if you're in different\ncommunities and we're solving problems\nor your students come with questions you\nhave your TA or the office hours all\nthese things work related we're not\ntalking I mean serious philosophy of\nunless you are in a philosophy\ndepartment and you are talking about\npolitical science\nand also we are not singing and dancing\nso that's why the evening activity even\nthese days are very different and\ntypically the evening activities uh\nwhere we express ourselves\nwe express who we are we feel like we\nare free and\num you know you and I we have this\nacademic intellectual Freedom we can\ntalk about our work just like we are\ntalking now there are a lot of people\nwho work for even in tech industry they\nmay be working for Google and all these\nbig tech companies\nthey cannot talk about their work to\nanybody else it's all secret it's all\nsecret so just imagine that staying so\nthey're spending\nmore than half of the wake-up time at\nwork\nthinking and doing work but they cannot\ntalk about that work even sometimes to\ntheir own family members\nso then what happens for them\na lot of people also do the same thing\nlike um the person who is going and\nbaking in a restaurant or cooking or the\nperson who is taking trust and driving\nor nurses and doctors can't talk about\ntheir patients reality yeah yeah and\nsome people just don't want to talk\nabout it it's so stressful they don't\nwant to bring that stress home\nso that's why I always say that from\nSunset until we go to bed during that\ntime we try to find time for ourselves\npeople say this is me time the me time\nis essentially we want to truly Express\nwho we are or we want to entertain\nourselves because on the Fireside chart\nit's not that everybody was a performer\nthere are also some audience so we\nalways switch our roles sometimes we are\nperforming and sometimes we are\nobserving so that's what happens with me\ntime I love this so um maybe social\nmedia time should be restricted to just\nmaybe a small portion of that evening\ntime because I would hope that people\nwould also interact socially within in\nthe room maybe in a constructive way or\nmaybe you use that for connect with your\nfamily members whom you love or you can\nhave some productive discussion or\nsomething so it's it's kind of\ninteresting I think it's extremely\ninteresting because I think again this\nthis conversation about time restricted\nfeeding is really conversation about\ncircadian rhythm and sleep wake activity\nand human evolution right\num so that's why let's go back to this\num uh Night Owl because uh we we kind of\nmade a comment that maybe it's not\ngenetic but this is where I'm still\nwrapping my head around because you know\nthese days\nthere's some J-1 studies where they're\ntrying to look at night owls to see\nwhether there are some genetic Lincolns\nand you know sometimes we always think\nyeah if you take half a million people\nof course you'll find some low side\nbut going back to this idea that are\nsome people more sensitive to light\nso that it's likely that the same level\nof light even in the same household\nmay make some people stay awake late\ninto the night whereas other people are\nmore resistant to light so that they can\ngo to bed early and since light has\nbecome so prevalent these days and this\ntobus story that we are talking about or\npeople going on camping that is we have\nremoved that light\num so there is some\num evidence that People's Light\nsensitivity particularly the iprgc or\nthis intrinsically photosensitive\nretinal ganglion cell or the simple\nspeakers the blue light sensors in our\neyes\num there seems to be even one log unit\nchange in sensitivity as measured by\npupil constriction so for some people a\nsmall amount of artificial light at\nnight could really shift their circadian\nclock yeah wake them up essentially and\nthen for some it manner yeah I'm very\nsensitive to light at night yeah\nexquisitely sensitive to it oh so then\nyou are like a teenager yes in many ways\num I've been told this thank you\num yeah I think\num I have actually switched to using a\nred night light but I should be clear\nnot a fancy high cost red light for sake\nof any kind of infrared simulation but a\nred party light type light and I find\nthat was based on reading one study that\nwe covered in an episode on jet lag and\nshift work which was that it seems to\nreduce the cortisol\nreleasing properties of light at night\nto use redshifted light yeah so I just\nuse a red light bulb I actually travel\nwith one if I go to an Airbnb or a hotel\nand I switch to red light and I find\nthat I fall asleep and stay asleep\nthroughout the night much more\nconsistently especially in when I'm in\nNew environments which always makes it\ndisruptive to sleep\num it's made an enormous difference in\nthe depth and duration of my sleep and\num because oftentimes Hotel lights you\nknow in the bathroom you'll turn them on\nyou're just you're just getting beam and\nyou're right some people don't seem to\nto be bothered by that I I really\nstruggle with that yeah and in fact in\nTina's uh right after puberty\num there seems to be a I think that's\nwhen the teenagers become more sensitive\nsensitive to light uh and it's very it's\nwell known that the teenage boys and\ngirls they tend to stay awake late into\nthe night and they can stay up to 12 mid\npast midnight\nalthough they can stay of that lid that\ndoesn't mean that their sleep schedule\nis reduced their body still needs the\nsame amount of sleep as other teenagers\nso that's why they are more likely not\nto wake up at 6 30 or 7 when we expect\nthem to wake up and go to school\num I have a question and I ask every\ncircadian related biologists that can\ncome into contact with this and no one\nhas been able to give me an answer one\nway or the other but I grew up hearing\nthat every hour of sleep before midnight\nwas of more value or potency than the\nhours after midnight and indeed I find\nthat if I go to sleep at 9 30 or 10 P.M\nI can wake up at three or four a.m\nfeeling pretty fantastic and ready to\nlean into the day but if I get the\nequivalent number of hours of sleep\nstarting at midnight I feel like\ncomplete garbage when I wake up after\nfive six hours so um is there any truth\nto the idea that going to sleep Within\nthree hours of sunset is somehow better\nfor our circadian timing mechanisms\nwell um there are a few things one you\nsaid that you are very sensitive to\nlight so I assume that you also avoid\nbright light in the evening as best I\ncan yeah as best as you could can and\nthen what is happening is with a sense\nof that bright light your melatonin\nlevels begin to rise so you are prepared\nfor Sleep\num of course this is something that we\ncannot measure because measuring\nmelatonin in every one hour or 30\nminutes\num is very difficult and there is no\nconsumer fishing product yet\nso it's likely that your your body is\npreparing very well under this dim light\nto fall asleep and when he was trying to\nstay awake and go\nsleep at midnight then maybe from\nMidnight for the first three or four\nhours you are sleeping well but then\nafter that your melatonin level might be\nbeginning to fall and it's not only\nmelatonin in your core body temperature\nand then your heart rate and everything\nis changing to make you awake but the\nSleep debt that you have accumulated is\npushing you to be in bed so there is\nthis\ntension between the Circadian aspect and\nyour sleep depth and unfortunately you\ncannot have good night of restorative\nsleep for the second half of the sleep\nbecause of the tension that makes good\nsense yeah so that's why\num you know you are not the only one\nmeans there are many people who who\nexperience that and in fact a lot of\npeople think that well this may be the\nway I sleep maybe I'm not um I am not\ndesigned to sleep restoratively until\nyou know I sleep one day just like the\ncamping trip\nand then they realize what it feels like\nwhat you're missing yeah absolutely\num I want to make sure that we talk\nabout the other aspect of fire which is\nuh you had a paper that came out\nrecently very interesting paper studying\nfirefighters and time restricted feeding\nand firefighters would you share with us\nthe the general contour and maybe even\nsome of the specifics of that study\nbecause I think it's very interesting\nfor for sake of shift workers but for\neverybody really to understand these\nresults yeah so let's go back to shift\nworkers because\num this also relates to all of us\nbecause\nI always say that each of us is a\nshipped worker or has lived the life of\na shift worker\num and we have experienced how terrible\ndifficult it is\num and now let's start with what is the\ndefinition of a shift worker or\num shipped work like lifestyle there is\nno Universal definition unfortunately\nbut there are many European countries\nand particularly if you go to\nInternational level organization\num then you'll find some references\ndifferent European countries have\nslightly different definition which\nessentially points to\nif you stay awake for two or more hours\nduring your habitual sleep time and when\nthey say habitual sleep time they assume\nthat we are just like you said we are\nkind of programmed to slave somewhere\nbetween say 10\npm and then stay in bed and kind of wake\nup after 5am\nso the idea is if you stay if you're\nstaying awake for two or more hours\nbetween 10 pm and 5 am\nand you are engaged in some activity\nwhether it's physical activity or\nintellectual activity you are not lying\nin bed and wondering worrying about\nsomething but actually working so that\ndefines that's defined as shift work and\nyou don't have to do it every single day\neven if you do it once a week\nfor 50 weeks\nthen that itself is enough to disrupt\nyour physiology and Metabolism Behavior\nbrain function like a shift worker the\nreason is as you discussed\nwhen you change\nour external timing queue so in this\ncase when you travel jet lag or or\ntraveling across three days\nthree hours of jet lag will take three\ndays to reset\nsimilarly if you're staying awake for\ntwo hours extra or if you're waking up\ntwo hours before your habitual wake-up\ntime then we just don't get wake up and\nthen be engaged in some activity in the\ndark most of us unmends unless you are\nwearing a infrared goggles\nwe turn on light and light resets our\nclock so in that way\nevery time we stay up for two or more\nhours even for one night then for the\nnext two nights our clock is kind of\ntrying to catch up\nso in that way for three days\nthe day of the disruption and then two\ndays following the disruption\num a clock is trying to catch up with\nthe outside time so clock our body is\nnot on time without clock\nso that means almost for half of the\nweek or half of the Year our clock is\ntrying to catch up so that's the\ndefinition of shift work so now let's\ncome back to\nDepartment of Labor Statistics um U.S\ngovernment\num they have not been tracking what\npercentage of people are doing shift\nwork accurately because there are many\ndifficulties in tracking too\nbut it's generally accepted that one in\nfive working adults is a card carrying\nshift worker card carrying shift workers\nmeans they are nurses\ndoctors\nfirefighters\num\nand Bakers\num truck drivers\nand many in the service industry\nso that's one in five so twenty percent\nof working adults\nthen if we think about\nall the college students just like I was\ndoing and you must have done\num they're also deadlines grants granted\nlines then we are also experiencing\nexperiencing the lifestyle of a shift\nworker because we are delaying sleep\neven if you're delaying sleep by two\nhours for most of the college students\nfor five days and then the weekend you\nare trying to catch up that's kind of a\nsecurity and disruption going on\nthen you take 1.5 or 1.6 million new\nmonths\num in the US every year so when the\nchild is born and that mother is a shift\nworker and actually that mother is worse\nthan a shift worker because\num you know you don't know what time of\nthe night the baby will wake up and how\nmany times and there is no weekend\nin motherhood\nso they're also living the life of a\nship worker\num we don't count many food delivery and\nUber drivers Lyft drivers are shift\nworkers but they many of them we know\nthat they live so in that way\nwe think the actual number of people who\nare experiencing the life of a shift\nworker is somewhere around 50 percent of\nthe adults population at any given time\nso that's why it's also another point\nthat you might have heard from people\nthat will say oh I cannot do time\nrestricting\nbecause my schedule is messed up or I\nwork in a different way and\num that comes into play\nso that's why we thought\num okay so we should try something on\nshift worker\nanother point is although one in five\npeople are shipped workers they carry\ndisproportionately heavier burden of\ndisease because almost all age-related\ndisease that we can think of whether\nit's high blood pressure usually high\nblood pressure starts in 40s or 50s\nhigh cholesterol\num gastrointestinal problem in digestion\num chronic\ninflammation of the colon and then even\ncolon cancer in many cases\nand then of course diabetes all of these\nare disproportionately more prevalent\namong ship workers\nbut then when you think about clinical\ntrials whether it's a drug\nor a lifestyle\noften one of the top 10 exclusion Factor\ncriteria is shift work so people who are\ndoing shift work we exclude them from\nmany of these trials one thing is\nmost Physicians and most scientists even\npeople who do shift work they know that\nthey are their body and mind is so\nmessed up\nthat often time even medications may not\nhelp them\nand so that's why we don't try new\nmedication why to take the risk when we\nknow it may not help them\nand then when it comes to Lifestyle\nintervention whether it's sleep\nextension for example we cannot do\nbecause they are supposed to stay awake\nand do their job we cannot ask them to\nstay asleep at night\nand then physical activity and exercise\nsome people can do but some people are\nso tired after all night that they don't\nhave the energy to do physical activity\nand then nutrition again most nutrition\nstudies involved\nthe participants to come to the clinic\nand get\num one-on-one or one or attend group\nsessions\nand they cannot come\nand they cannot even sometimes come to\nthe clinic visit\num when people have to take draw blood\nand in fact there is another caveat that\njust\nif suppose I am healthy\nperfectly normal blood pressure blood\nglucose cholesterol everything is normal\nand I live the life of a shift worker\njust for five nights that means I'm\nsleeping less maybe four or five hours\nand even if I don't eat at night time\nof course many shift workers also feel\nhungry and just for um to keep their\nwork they eat\num just after five days my blood glucose\nlevel will read almost like I'm\npre-diabetic wow I actually saw a study\nin publishing procedures in the National\nAcademy that showed that even a hundred\nLux dim Light present in the room while\npeople are sleeping with eyes closed can\nlead to disruptions in morning uh blood\nglucose levels in directions that are\nnot good yeah um one night so the the\nfaint clock in the corner or even a a\nnight light that's too bright yeah could\nbe problematic\num by the way folks these effects are\nreversible so I whenever I say these\nthings I we get a lot of comments about\noh my goodness what have I been doing\nfor years but you know kids with Night\nLights this is an issue yeah um but what\nI'm hearing is that one in five people\nare\ntruly shift workers in the classic sense\ntheir jobs require they work at night or\ninto the night and sleep into the day\nbut far more people are shift workers by\nvirtue of the fact that they're Tweeting\nor working or watching movies at night\neven though it's not work in that\nthey're not being paid for that time\nthey are essentially operating like\nshift workers if we add those two groups\ntogether would we say it's what uh a\nthird of Americans I would say half of\nAmerica half of America yeah if you take\nteenagers because you know high school\nstudents and college students because\nagain going back to horacio's uh study\nbecause Horatio also collected\nactivity data from high school students\nand college students and we have\nreplicated that with high school\nstudents and college students in San\nDiego so that's Seattle and San Diego\nand this study now there are many sleep\nresearchers that have been collecting\nthis data\nand what we find is\num typically the high school students\nthey are going to beds around midnight\nand college students at least the UCSD\nstudents we found maybe one out of 100\nwho went to bed before midnight that um\nreminds me that Horacio Iglesias just\npublished this really nice paper\num showing that counter to what we\nbelieve students now this is the\nUniversity of Washington in Seattle I\nshould mention where it's very dark in\nthe winter\nyoung people see other people in their\n20s are staying up later in the winter\nmonths compared to the summer months\nyeah which is you know totally\ncounter-intuitive you think everyone\nstays up late in the summer and goes to\nbed early in the winter but because of\nartificial lighting it's the exact\nopposite yeah so and another um it's um\nI don't know whether Horacio monitored\nit but my other suspicion I'm not saying\nwhether it's true in Winter we are more\nlikely to consume more coffee hot\nchocolate in the evening and that might\nalso be delaying\nslip onset that makes sense so in that\nway again here is another thing which\ncan be related to policy or practice at\nEducational Institute so what happened\nduring uh kovid was everybody went to\nremote learning\num the assignments became digital and\nassignments submission became digital\nand there are many systems online\nsystems that came into play\nand by default the assignment submission\ndeadline became midnight\nso then now what is happening is I don't\nknow about Stanford in maybe when you\nare giving assignment um one is the\ndeadline in line typically midnight yeah\nso then most of us most students they\nwill try to cram as much as possible try\nto solve as much as possible and submit\nat midnight\nand it'll be really cool to go back to\nyour system administrator to see is\nthere so many frequency plot of\nfrequency distribution of what time\npeople are submitting the\num assignment because we know means when\nwe submit our grant yeah so I mean you\nknow you hear about the Obesity crisis\nthe crisis of metabolic disorders not\njust in the US but everywhere in the\nworld I mean it's really striking I\nremember going to a keystone meeting\nscientific meeting in the early 2000s\nand there was a map of the United States\nand it showed where the Obesity rates\nwere over 30 percent in adults and the\nentire country basically was lighting up\nlike crazy now it would be the entire\ncountry but there were these kind of\nzones in the middle\num that were almost devoid of of uh\nobesity Colorado namely Idaho at that\ntime those are now also Fallen Under the\nUmbrella of rampant obesity and you and\neveryone is speculating okay is it uh\nyou know is it seed oils is it\num is it this is it that is it highly\nprocessed foods I'm guessing it's all of\nthose things including lack of activity\nbut one has to wonder given everything\nwe're talking about in terms of\nmetabolic dysfunction late shifted\neating all these issues with late\nshifted eating and staying up late with\nartificial lighting whether or not that\ncould be one of the major factors in the\nso-called obesity crisis it's likely you\nknow we always say Freshman 15 that's\nright because this is a gaining 15\npounds in their freshman year in college\nand\num this is where I think as executor\nprofessors um it'll be interesting to go\nback and see what can we do because\nanother thing that's also becoming more\nand more common for example I I give a\nsecurity under the class means I just\ngive two lectures and I remember when I\nstarted 15 17 years ago that lecture\nused to be around 1 30 p.m or 2 p.m in\nthe afternoon and it's a two and a half\nhour lecture so it's done by five\nand for the last um before the pandemic\nI realized that they changed the timing\nnow the lecture was starting at 7 pm so\nI was finishing by 9 9 30 pm and these\nkids they had to go and eat after 9 30.\nstudies socialize find aside chat\nfireside chat and then to express\nthemselves like to feel free from\nassignments what are they going to do\nthat after they submit the assignment\nthen they're going to do that\nso that's why we have to go back and\nrevisit this issue say okay so for\nadults for most of us who are working a\nday job\nour deadline is 5 PM in most cases\nright men's at least an University\nsystem the person who is submitting the\ngrant or who is doing taking care of my\nIRB or I cook they are all living at\nfive o'clock so for me everything has to\nend by five I think for most people out\nthere so this the race is a kind of\nmacroscopic question which is maybe it's\nnot so much about restricting the\nfeeding window but maybe it's about\nfeeding mostly in and being active\nmostly in the early part of the day I\nmean you know I could imagine a Time\nthree four years from now when it's\nabout when waking up early and going to\nbed within three hours of sunset is the\nprotocol which harnesses all other\nprotocols right you're going to exercise\nyou're going to do it in that time\nyou're going to eat you're going to do\nit in that time you're going to\nsocialize you're going to do it in that\ntime and in doing so you're also\navoiding a lot of the issues related to\ndisrupted sleep so that's why all these\nthings I just said Timeless repeating is\njust one aspect of the security and\nhealth and these are all interconnected\nand going back to the comment about\num within three hours of sunset yes um\nthat's good but then what happens in say\nToronto or Vancouver in winter time I\nguess they're going to bed very very\nearly but also waking up very very early\nyeah you know one of the things that I\nhear all the time because I'm always\nbeating on the drum of getting morning\nsunlight even if through Cloud covers\npeople say there's no sun here this time\nof year and I I forgive me but there is\nSun unless you live in a cave their son\nis just coming through cloud cover no\nmatter where you live in the world their\nson yeah unless you live in a cave of\ncourse so um I want to make sure that uh\nwe didn't Overlook what was the major\nconclusion of the firefighters\nso the reason why we did this study was\nas I said there are a lot of us who are\nliving the lifestyle of firefighters or\nshipped workers and shipped workers are\nexcluded from studies so that means\nwhatever we are learning about a\nlifestyle or even medications that may\nbe beneficial for people who actually\nhave a normal schedule\num but not for people who have a\ndisrupted schedule and if you look up\num clinicaltrial.gov there are more than\n400 000 studies listed and if you search\nhow many studies are on shift workers\nit's less than a thousand\nand then if you ask most of them are to\nsee what is wrong with shipped workers\nlike that's how we know that shift work\nincreases our risk for metabolic disease\ncancer and even some aspects of dementia\nbut if you ask how many studies are done\nto improve the health of shift work\nalone and that's less than 50 means I\nmean so I have to go back and check the\nactual number but it's less than 50. wow\nso that's why\num we got super excited we thought\num from circadian rhythm perspective\nthat's something to address\nso this study\nagain this kind of study is only\npossible because I'm at Salk and we are\naffiliated with UCSD and\num I can work with UCSD Physicians to do\nthis study so I collaborate with Dr Pam\ntobb who is the director of cardiac\nrehab center in UCSD and Pam has many\nfirefighters as her patients and we both\nknow that the number one cause for death\nand disability on work for firefighters\nis not fighting fire but just getting\nheart attack and stroke uh so they have\na very high incidence of heart attack\nand stroke and they're also highly prone\nto different kinds of cancer and it may\nbe difficult to ascribe cancer to\ndisruption security and disruption\nbecause they're also exposed to a lot of\ntoxins anytime Fire Burns that smell of\nfire is essentially smell of\ncarcinogens and they're breathing even\nif they have the\num hood on and respirator they're still\ngood so the idea was very simple we know\nthat firefighters nearly\n70 percent of firefighters in the U.S\nfull-time firefighters because there are\nvolunteer firefighters and then\nfull-time firefighters the full-time\nfirefighters 70 of them work 24 hours\nshift\nso for example in San Diego they come in\nat their shift is from 8 AM to 8 am the\nnext day and they do at least in San\nDiego they do one day on one day off on\noff four cycles and then four days off\nand but in some fire departments they\nactually do 48-hour shift so they come\nfor two days two days off two days two\ndays off and then four or five days\nthank you firefighters yeah I mean\num so then the idea was okay so we'll\nscreen firefighters and then find\nfirefighters who are\nmetabolically unhealthy and then we'll\nsee whether they can actually follow 10\nhours time restricted eating because\nthe point is if firefighters can follow\nit then everybody else will pay for us\nwith all that stress if they can\nand this is again where I should also\nacknowledge the San Diego fire and\nrescue Department because without their\nhealth we could not have even submitted\nthe grant and at that time David picon\nwho is the health and wellness battalion\nchief he's the one who actually\napproached us\num because he is very careful he knew\nthat the job that they do\nmakes them weaker and long term and can\nkill them in long term\nso he was always looking for new\nSolutions so he approached us and then\nwe said this is the idea he said well I\nlove this idea because\nwe are not asking them to sleep more or\nwe are not going to cut down their over\ntime or shift or change the work\nschedule the only thing we'll be doing\nis ask them to eat within 10 hours\nand hopefully we can do this so\nconsistently between the days that\nthey're working and not working yes so\nthat means if they're from 8 A.M to 8\nA.M working then the next day then they\ngo home then they're going to eat on the\nsame schedule they did when they were at\nthe fire Firehouse yeah but while at\nhome so they're not allowing themselves\nto to deviate from that yeah so we we\nthought whether they can do it or not\nbecause the number one goal or the\nprimary outcome in this clinical trial\nwas feasibility can they do it\nand then second was if they do it then\nwhat happens to their blood sugar and\nweight and all this other stuff\nand then we started the study and we hit\nthe next hurdle and that is\num\nyou know firefighters are very very\ntight-knit community and they want to\nmake sure that you understand their\nculture and the best way to understand\ntheir culture is to live the life of a\nfirefighter\nso Emily Manoogian who is the first\nauthor see and then we had Adina\njadurian who is now in med school she\nwas a research coordinator at that time\nthey volunteered they said okay we'll go\nto the\nbusiest fire station in San Diego\nand will live the life of a firefighter\nand the San Diego fire and rescue and\nthe city they all agreed they reported\nfor duty at 7 30 in the morning they\nwere assigned a\nbed in the station because all fire\nstations do have some beds for\nfirefighters to rest and they have a\nsign bed so they've assigned a bet\num yeah so every time a 911 call chem\nand if that fire station in that fire\nstation that fire engine was called then\njust like other firefighters they had to\nrun get into the gears just issues and\num a jacket and a helmet and getting the\nseat and attend the call of course they\nwon't go to this side they just get out\nof the truck wait there\nthen come back\nso in that 24 hours MLA got 10 calls at\nnight that she had to run to but there\nare more than 10 times the\num they got the nine one every time the\n911 call came then there is a bit that\ngoes out\nall firefighters were sleeping or\nresting they would get up or if they're\ndoing something they'll look up to see\nwhich engine is called and interesting\nso it's not just the ones that go out\nit's everyone gets woken up everyone\ngets woken up so that means in a night\ntypical night they're waking up\num 10 15 20 times sometimes so they're\nalmost like\num you know new months are like\nfirefighters because they don't have any\nidea what time the baby will cry and for\nwhat reason also they don't know so\nsimilarly it's five so that's what Emily\ndid and then next morning once you came\nback she was like no it's practical seem\neasy\nyeah so so then we did the study and we\nessentially assigned uh all the\nfirefighters we recruited 155 Fighters\nwe assigned half of them to\nMediterranean diet because you cannot do\nany harm you have to give them something\ngood so that's another thing they said\nno we want something that we know works\nfor firefighters and there was a\nMediterranean diet study so\neverybody was supposed to follow\nMediterranean diet and then have nearly\n75 of them were supposed to eat within\n10 hours\nwe did not fix the 10 hours because we\nsaid\num you pick your own 10 hours that you\ncan stick to but it has to be consistent\nfrom day to day so if you start eating\nat 9am you finish it not at uh you know\nat seven PM pm and then try to be yeah\nokay try to try to be consistent because\nwe said yes we understand that there\nwill be some things and you can take\nmaybe half an hour here and there and\nwe'll see how many times you can do it\nand\num\nwhat is interesting about although they\nwere all doing 24 hour shift\nmore or less chose to begin eating\nsomewhere between 8 AM and 11 am\nand they\ndid not skip any meal they had their\nfirst meal or what we call breakfast but\nit was several hours after waking up\nbecause they are waking up at five or\nsix and the driving to come to work at 7\n30 or 8 and they're eating the first\nmeal say between 8 and 11. and then the\nfinished meal 10 hours later\nand what we found is more or less\nmost of them could stick to doing this\nat least five days out of seven days\num and then at the end of the study when\nwe look at their health parameters\none thing as I said\nwe recruited everybody who can so that\nmeans nearly\none in three firefighters were\ncompletely healthy they had no sign of\nany\num any illness no high blood pressure\nhigh blood sugar or high cholesterol\ndepression or anything\nso since we have one third of the\npopulation who are already healthy and\nthen everybody has slightly different\nconditions some have high blood pressure\nbut they don't have high blood glucose\nsomebody has high blood glucose but not\nhigh blood pressure\nso it was kind of heterogeneous so\nwe did not see big difference in weight\nloss or any wet change between these two\ngroups another thing is firefighters\nactually run almost eight to nine miles\nwhen they're at the job because that's\npart of their\nexercise routine\nbut then one thing that changed\nsignificantly in the time restorating\ngroup was what we call bldl particle\nsize and particle number because this is\nsomething that we know this very low\ndensity lipoprotein these are\natherogenic and if we can manage them\nmuch better and we reduce the risk for\natherosclerosis so that's one parameter\nthat changed in the time restricting\ngroup even when you combine all healthy\nunhealthy everybody\nnow if we take firefighters who are\nbeginning with high blood pressure\nthen we saw a significant reduction in\nthat systolic as well as diastolic blood\npressure\nand the change in blood pressure of\ncourse we don't claim that in the\nmanuscript but when we talk about it\nsome physician would get up and say wow\nthat looks like almost there on a blood\npressure lowering drug so the extent of\nblood pressure lowering is equivalent to\nsomebody taking a antihypertensive drug\namazing yeah and then those who started\nwith high blood sugar of course we\ndidn't have too many type 2 diabetic but\nthere were a few few pre-diabetic and\nthey could better manage their blood\nglucose and this is interesting because\nonce\nshift workers\nbecome pre-diabetic or diabetic they\nhave more difficulty managing their\nblood sugar than non-shipped workers\nbecause the work schedule itself will\nmess them up too much even if they're on\nmany medications they have difficulty\nthat's fascinating and I I'm really glad\nthat you explained the study in such\ndetail because I would have thought you\nknow from reading the abstract and I did\nlook at the data but if someone were to\nlook at the abstract they'd say oh\nfirefighters so they're waking up in the\nmiddle of the night and they're you know\nthrowing on their gear and going out to\ncalls and doing but if I understand\ncorrectly all firefighters are being\nwoken up by the signal which makes the\nfirefighter population a bit more\nsimilar to the more standard population\nwho's waking up in the middle of the\nnight to use the bathroom getting on\nsocial media for a couple of minutes or\nflipping on the lights I mean it's maybe\nnot as severe as what firefighters are\ndoing\num but we know there are blood sugar\nregulation issues related to those\nmultiple middle of the night wakings\nespecially if people are then staring at\nscreens yeah\num so I think it's really important that\npeople were able to hear about the the\ndeeper Contours of the study uh I mean\nthis result of regulating blood sugar\nbetter is really powerful I get asked\nall the time you know I've got a new kid\nor I'm a shift worker how can I do this\nmorning sunlight viewing\num what I'm hearing is that keeping a\nregular meal schedule every day\nat least five five out of seven or as\nclose to every day it's sort of like\nsleep I always say try and get a really\ngreat night's sleep 80 or more of the\nnights of your life and on the other 20\nhopefully it's for fun reasons a great\nparty or something like that or a\ncelebration of some sort\num\nthat seems to me a great Anchor Point\nwhen one can't reliably control their\nsleep wake cycle does that mean that if\nsomebody is coming off of shift work and\nthey're very very tired that they would\nbe better off staying awake and eating\nthan sleeping well it's uh yeah so this\nis where we get into nuances so here the\nfirefighters are 24-hour shipped workers\nso that means and they have been working\nthis shift for a very long time so they\nhave figured out and one thing is yes\nfirefighters are different from nurses\nand healthcare workers who have to work\nthroughout the night and they're staying\nawake throughout the night whereas\nfirefighters they get opportunity to\nsleep then even with their\npen calls they actually have opportunity\nto come back and go to sleep and in fact\nwhen Emily and Adina they were in the\nfastest and what they observed was\nfirefighters after they after attending\na call they are not coming back and\nplaying cards or trying to watch the\nnews or get the score they know they\nwill just go back and lie in the bed and\nswitch off the light so whenever they\ngot any opportunity to sleep they would\ntry to sleep so in that way\ntheir sleep debt and sleep pressure\nduring day time is not as strong as a\nnight shift nurse\nor a truck driver who is driving all\nnight because they have they're staying\nawake throughout the night so when\npeople say yes you found this and can\nyou extend it to other shift workers my\nanswer is no we have to go back and\nfigure out that's why we went to this\nstation and figured out what would work\nfor them\nif I have to go and do this for some\nnurses maybe even I will go or our staff\nwill go and figure out what is the work\nschedule what happens do they have\nopportunity to eat do they have\nopportunity to even take five minutes\nbreak what do they do during break and\nall of these things come into play but\nhere another thing is um\nI always said that in other time receipt\nreading paper we see change in nutrition\nquality and quantity but here we also\nsaw that somehow both groups\ninadvertently the\nimprove the nutrition quality because\neverybody was told to eat Mediterranean\ndiet they increase their fruits and\nvegetables and olive oil and text\nslightly\nand when they had to stop eating early\nthey also reduced the alcohol intake\nand this is very significant because\nmany shift workers just to cope with the\nshift work that tend to depend on\nalcohol at night and caffeine in the\nmorning so they begin their day with\ncaffeine and end with alcohol\nand now we can relate that many normal\npeople who are not doing shift work we\nalso more or less begin our day with\ncaffeine and many of us and with alcohol\nand then when they reduce that 18 to 10\nhours and then we saw a significant\nreduction in alcohol intake in the time\nrestrating group but not in the standard\nof care or Mediterranean diet group I\ncertainly support that we did an episode\non alcohol and I was\nshocked when I researched that to learn\nthat zero to two drinks per week is\nessentially the threshold Beyond which\nyou start seeing health\ndeficits in particular Cancers and\nmetabolic disruption sleep disruption\nand increased anxiety when people aren't\nunder the influence of alcohol I mean\nit's a pretty incredible how alcohol has\nkind of escaped as the the opposite of\ncaffeine and therefore\num not a health hazard it's and here I'm\nsomebody I have a drink every once in a\nwhile no big deal for me I can have it\nor not have it but it's just striking\nhow\num alcohol despite extensive data that\nit can really disrupt Health even at\nthree drinks per week yeah is um is just\navidly consumed as if it was kind of\nlike food or caffeine it's really\nincredible\num I I want to make sure that I Circle\nback to something you mentioned earlier\nbecause I know they're going to be a\nnumber of people that asked this if I\nrecall you said that provided that the\nfeeding window is not shorter than eight\nhours that men women and children can\nuse time restricted feeding\num yeah so what I say is um\n12 hours 12 excuse me 12 hours thank you\nfor that clarifying um because we did a\nstudy that was published in 2015 and\nagain\num behind many of our studies there is a\nstory\nso we are publishing all these Mouse\nstories and then I would go to\nconferences and and of course the\num some some people would give me a look\nsaying well you must be doing something\nwrong we\nthis just breaks the\nX law of thermodynamics because how come\nthey're eating the same number of\ncalories and not getting wet and of\ncourse by that time we figured out that\nat least in Mouse\nTimeless repeating also changes the gut\nmicrobiome in a way that the mice may be\npopping out a little bit more fat than\nsugar than absorbing them so one thing\nthat happens in time restricting at\nleast in mice is the liver cholesterol\nmetabolism to bile acid and bile acids\nexcretion in the gut changes because\nthey gut microbiome changes so this is a\nvery nice study when Amir jarinpar was\nin the lab now he has his own lab in\nUCSD and he meticulously did that and we\nwe even did bomb calorimetry from the\npoop and metabolomics from the poop and\nthen we figured out that they excrete\nsome some calories and then that brown\nfat activity goes up so there may be\nburning some of these extra calories so\nthey're more thermogenic more\nthermogenic but anyway so you know one\nnice thing awesome thing about Salk is\nif they say that your science is going\nwell then they will find ways to help\nyou and this is terrific yeah and um\nthis is when\nBill Brody was our president he was the\npresident of um\num Hopkins for 12 years and then he was\npresident\nand\num that time he had started this\nInnovation grant program which was\nfunded by arvind Jacob uh Arun is the\nfounder of Qualcomm it was also a\nfaculty at UCSD so he understand there\nare very few\nTech leaders who actually spent some\ntime in Academia so he understood the\npain of getting grant money when you\nhave some interesting idea or test some\nideas so yeah no knock on the NIH but\nI'll do it anyway because I sit on study\nsection for the NIH I mean NIH wants to\nsee proposals for things that are so\ncertain to work that they're mostly done\nand so really groundbreaking work can\nhappen and does happen with NIH funding\nbut more often than not is it is the\ngenerosity of philanthropists like Irwin\nJacobs and other people that allow the\nreally pioneering\num the new stuff the cool stuff yeah the\ngroundbreaking stuff the stuff that\nreally no I'm not gonna say really\nmatters it all matters it's all\nimportant no it matters but uh you know\nit's high risk and\num NIH when San is is not just\ngovernment is not making money from thin\nair means it's taxpayers money so there\nis a little bit responsibility or\nconservative that okay so we should not\nwaste tracks first money on buying this\nguy\nwe're not talking about politically\nconservative we're talking about\num scientifically conservative to be so\ncareful what language nowadays pretty\nsoon we're just gonna sit and stare at\none another at the microphones to stay\nsafe\num so so that's interesting so they so\nthat's why I started this and then what\nwe did was we um I had an awesome grad\nstudent and we got this funding from\nArwin and also there are some\nany philanthropy matters so actually the\nway we say is yes if you give me 50\nbucks then that 50 bucks towards goes\ntowards buying the gloves and a friend\nof tubes for one postdoc for maybe seven\ndays so it's so true I think a lot of\npeople don't realize that 99 of\nlaboratory scientists just they they\ndon't make any money off their\ndiscoveries and even if there is a\npatentable discovery typically the The\nDivide between the institution and the\ncompany that will eventually put that to\nMarket is so slim in favor of the the\nothers involved that you know scientists\nreally do this as a work of passion\nlabor labor of love so so we we came up\nwith this app my security and clock at\nthat time and we took some\num you know lessons from Tech leaders um\nparticularly from Amazon one click\ncheckout\num because we thought most nutrition\napps actually ask people to detailed\ndescribe or they add go to their food\nlibrary and then person size they said\nokay so we'll just shortcut all of that\nI just ask people to take a picture of\nthe food open the app one click take a\npicture second click and press save\nthird click and when they said the\npicture actually came to our server did\nnot stay on their phone\nand we asked 156 people who are not\nshipped workers just regular worker or\nHomemakers to be part of the study\nno student was allowed to be part of the\nstudy because we know that there's a\nlifestyle is like ship workers and we\nmonitor for three weeks and\nso here is some nuances and I want\npeople to understand\nwhen somebody is starting to eat at say\n7 A.M and\nsince the recording everything we've\nwe've got every single thing even if\nthey ate half a cookie they had to take\na picture and they actually took picture\nbecause it's not it becomes second\nnature after three or four days that\nevery time they add something even if\nthere is a glass of water they actually\ntake a picture because we asked them\ntake picture of everything we'll figure\nout what it is\nwhat is surprising what we found\nthe median uh so the median number of\ntimes people eat within a day 24 hours a\nday is actually seven so it's not\nit's not that we are eating three times\na day we actually snack a little bit\nseven times per day seven times and\nthere are 10 percent of people the top\ndecile was eating\n12 times a day wow\num and it makes sense in retrospect\nsometimes maybe I'll fall into that\nseven or eight before\num I did this study because you know\ngetting up having coffee with cream and\nsugar is one and then I ate my breakfast\nthat's two then I came to the love and I\nfound that cookie that's three\nI went to a meeting and there was some\ncookie and something else that's another\none and lunch and then afternoon\nsomebody asked me to go out and have a\nmeeting and so if you think about it\nit's very normal that we can go seven to\neight times ten times\nbut then\nif we look at what time say I start\nbreakfast and as I said and we see that\nin many people they'll start at seven\no'clock Monday then 7 30 another day\nthen 8 15 another day or they go back to\n6 a.m because they had to get up early\nand go to work so we took all this food\ndata from three weeks and then asked\nwhat is the time when your body's system\nis expecting it to eat because it's kind\nof averages Southeast kind of thinking\nokay\nmaybe for you if you're eating breakfast\nat say somewhere between 6 AM 7 30 7 45\nI eat it maybe you are expecting food\naround seven o'clock let's forget about\n6 15 that's an outlier and then\nsimilarly at the end of the day\nif somebody is eating finishing the last\nbite or the night Gap whatever you call\nit\nsay one day at 9 pm 9 30 p.m 10 11 12 30\nor 1. Let's ignore that 1 and 12 30 but\nstill we got somewhere between seven to\neleven thirty for that person over three\nweeks time so this is how we kind of\nfigure out what is the likelihood that\nyour body will encounter food\nso when we do that what we found was\nnearly 50 percent of our dogs in our\nstudy\nate for 14 hours 45 minutes that window\nwhen your body is expecting food\nso it's easy to say that 50 of adults\nare eating within 15 hours or longer\nwow and and quite frequently throughout\nquite frequently too and then\nif we ask what fraction of our adults\nwere actually eating the conventional\nwithin 12 hours three meals a day or\nsomething like that it was 10 percent\nso this snacking has gone up\ndramatically however you wanted to find\nsnacking the frequency of food intake\nthroughout the day and outside this\nbreakfast lunch and dinner there are all\nthese small snacks here and there and\nalso for a lot of people the dinner is\ndelayed and we went back and looked at\nokay so what kind of food people are\neating late at night and all that stuff\nand what came out interesting which is\nvery counterintuitive is people who\nprepare their own dinner\nthey're more likely to eat later at\nnight\nbecause they're coming home and then\nthey're taking some time to prepare\ndinner and then they're sitting down and\neating or maybe they're eating next to\nthe computer whatever it is\nso it's kind of interesting that came\nout\num but coming back to your point that's\nwhy I say that nearly 90 percent of\nadults\nare eating for more than 12 hours\nso that means a lot of people can\nthere is scope or there is enough head\nspace to reduce and eat within so as I\nsaid\nall of this are interrelated so when you\nthink about children\nmost sleep researchers agree that\nchildren and teenagers should sleep\nsomewhere between 9 to 10 or 11 hours\nbecause young children even five to ten\nyear old they should sleep nine to ten\nhours they're just pumping out growth\nhormone and growing growing and then the\nteenagers actually the recommendation is\nand they should be sleeping nine hours\nbecause\nif you take teenagers\ntake out all the stimulatory inputs to\nthem and then remove homework assignment\nand everything and then let them kind of\nequilibriate to their homeostasis what\nare likely how many hours they're likely\nto sleep\nthat turns out to be somewhere between\neight and a half to nine and a half\nhours\nwhich also means that going back to\nsleep\nnearly 90 percent of\nhigh school students in this country are\nchronically sleep deprived because most\nhigh school students don't get nine\nhours of sleep on a regular basis maybe\nin the weekend probably because of\ndevices yeah on iPads and also as I said\nthis new idea that midnight is your\nassignment submission time I'll come\nback to that again and again I'm hearing\nthat again again so teachers take note\nit's an issue it's a very interesting\nidea as a way to kind of anchor Behavior\nearlier in the day yeah learning to in I\nmean Public Health\nuh is complicated because people are\nincentivized by fear but they you know\nyou get more bees with honey as they say\nright you know there's uh incentivizing\npeople to wake earlier not necessarily\nwith the sunrise but wake earlier and go\nto sleep earlier and eat within an 8 to\n12 hour window\num 12 if it's yeah so that's my children\nyeah it sounds to me like you know all\nthese health benefits are what I think\nare going to incentivize people more\nthan for instance this idea that well if\nyou don't do this you're going to get\nDementia or something right but like\nevery day people will feel more healthy\nand more productive\nand so that's why I said that even if\nchildren are supposed to sleep for nine\nhours of course they're not eating\nduring those nine hours\nand we're not uh feeding children and\nputting them down to slay because you\nknow their core body temperature will be\nhigh they cannot fall asleep so at least\nthey should have their last meal one or\ntwo hours before going to bed because\ntypically\nparents feed them and maybe give them a\nshower or a butt and then they read the\nbedtime story so it's one to two hours\nbefore bedtime they're finishing food\nsimilarly on the other end after they\nwake up it's not that we're waking them\nup and then feeding them so hopefully\nwe're not doing that so that's at 12\nhours seems to be\nOptimum and it's not only I'm saying\nthat if we put all the health\nrecommendations together from\npediatrists and then it makes sense\num fascinating I have a question about\nstructuring meal intake or food intake\num during the eating window\num I have a good friend actually he's um\nhe's the neurosurgeon at neurolink now\nbut he came up through Stanford and um\nand he has a habit of eating of skipping\none meal per day within a feeding window\nso it might be breakfast lunch skip\ndinner one day then it might be\nbreakfast dinner the next day lunch and\ndinner the next one so it's not in\nkeeping with the same start time always\nbut the end time is either going to be\nearlier or there's a gate it's never\nlater yeah it's never later\num what do you think about that as a\nstrategy\num you know in many ways it feels like\nthat fits with the way that a lot of\npeople's lives run so sometimes for\ninstance if I'm in a podcast I don't\ntend to eat much in the middle of the\nday because it makes me a little bit\ngroggy the post perennial dip in energy\nso I'll do breakfast well but again at\n11 and that's a first that's when I\nbreak my fast 11ish and then dinner\nmaybe a snack in the middle of the day\nbut other days it's three meals so does\nit matter\num overall as long as\num one isn't allowing the start time and\nthe ending time to drift out is it okay\nif you go from 12 hours to ten to eight\neight ten four twelve as long as you\ndon't exceed that the the brackets are\nyou okay uh so this is where the\nCircadian aspect come in because if\nyou're going\num if you're moving that breakfast time\nor dinner time three four hours\nessentially\ncausing maybe a metabolic jet lag you\nknow in short term in weeks months or\nmaybe even few years you may not see any\nchange\num at the same time we don't know what\nis the long term consequences one thing\nis we always think I'll come back to\nthis point again and again we think that\na body weight is a marker of Health\nor body composition is a marker of\nHealth it's not always true because as I\nsaid issue drift locks\num filling\num you know having some Pang of\ndepression or anxiety or LDL like high\nLDL a lot of thin people have or low\nbody fat people have very high LDL yeah\nso those are the things that um we don't\nconnect with our habit and since\nsecurity under them and meal timing meal\nstructure now is a very new\num field\num I think good studies will come out\nonly in a few years because right now\npeople are just going back and\nretrospectively looking at some Diet\nrecord one day of diet record and trying\nto glean too much out of it but I think\nhopefully things will improve where\npeople will become it will become\nstandard to at least look for one week\nof diet record meal time and what\nthey're eating all that stuff because uh\nare now Mouse studies also showing what\na front loading carbohydrate or front\nloading fat or protein has benefit over\nso I think this studies are starting so\nI should not comment whether that's good\nor bad no I think it's great to hold off\nuntil then we have you back on to\ndiscuss\num I have a question about\num fasting on the longer term\num and there it's a near Infinite Space\nwe could explore of two days of fasting\none day I know people that every once in\na while they just decide I'm fasting\nthey've either been eating too much at\nparties or they're not feeling well or\nwhatever they just decide I'm fasting\nfor 24 hours and um they'll still\nconsume water and caffeine but they'll\njust fast is there any health benefit or\ndetriment\num you mentioned the circadian clock\nshifting effects but if somebody wakes\nup on Sunday and they you know they ate\ntoo much or they feel they ate too much\nor they don't like the food they ate on\nSaturday they're not really feeling it\nand they're just going to fast into\nMonday is there any known benefit or\num Health detriment to doing that kind\nof thing yeah there's a actually a rich\nliterature on this complete fast\num an impact in many religions people\npracticed complete fast as you were to\ncleanse their body and\npeople have seen that there are benefits\nto that so in fact the every other day\neating in Mouse model or even in humans\nare also initially some studies were\ndone there are many health benefits\nand right now there are even fasting\nclinics in Germany where people check in\nand they're under strict supervision and\nthen they do complete fast or maybe a\nsmall bowl of soup which has 100 200\nkilocal and that's all they get to eat\nsometimes\ntwo three days four days five days even\nthey have gone up to three or four weeks\nfor sake of weight loss is that why from\nmany different things and\num they come out pretty well healthy of\ncourse they're under supervision make\nsure that they're getting macro\nmicronutrients sorry the micronutrients\nvitamins and electrolytes\nso those studies are pretty solid people\nhave observed that and then in fact\nthere are even idea that fasting this\nkind of fasting can have huge impact on\nbrain and people may come out of\ntreatment resistant depression or\nsomething but you know so those studies\nare very difficult to do they're only\ncase of one here and there that we hear\nonce in a while but hopefully in future\nwe'll see\num whether the depression anxiety the\nmental health aspect will benefit from\nfasting because now as there is more and\nmore evidence that there's this gut\nbrain axis and whether the presence of\nfood or the microbiome changes in the\ngut if they can affect brain then maybe\nlong-term fasting periodic fasting a few\ndays of low calorie diet back to back\nwill be interesting to see how it\nimpacts brain health\nvery interesting what are your thoughts\non fat fasting where people try and\nlimit their blood glucose by only eating\nmainly fats mainly healthy typically\nthey'll eat healthier Fatso of avocados\nolive oils and nuts you know and some\nanimal fats perhaps but\num\nas a way to keep blood glucose low and\nalso time restrict this goes back to the\nkind of low carbohydrate\num thing what are your thoughts on that\nas as a general strategy for health I\nmean it combines sort of two general\nthemes that are out there I think both\nof which are you know data are still\nincoming that restricting the feeding\ntimes it can be beneficial as well as\nkeeping overall blood glucose lower can\nbe beneficial\nyeah I think there is too much uh\nemphasis now on blood sugar spiking or\num we don't know\num this kind of eating pattern for\nexample means we are essentially telling\npancreas that okay it's or the eyelid\ncells that produce uh insulin and it's\nokay you can take\num take a break go on vacation for you\nfor a month or two or three months\num my question is it will be interesting\nto see what happens to those eyelets\nbecause for example we know that if we\nthis user unused our muscles that is\nmuscle atrophy muscles will become\nweaker\nwe don't know whether long-term\nconsequences of this very low\ncarbohydrate diet where you are not\nessentially engaging the\neyelid cells periodically what is its\nimpact so if there is no impact maybe\nit's okay maybe because\nas you know many people who actually\nwork on ketogenic diet the researchers\nthemselves they find it very difficult\nto stay in true ketogenic diet because\nthe true ketogenic diet is consuming\nless than 10 percent of calories from\ncarbohydrate and not very many from\nprotein a lot of people think ketogenic\ndiet allows them to eat massive amounts\nof meat and that's not necessarily the\ncase just one clarification for people\num uh Sachin was referring to islet\ncells of the pancreas which are the ones\nthat manufacture insulin so the question\nis whether or not taking in low levels\nof blood glucose by way of a low\ncarbohydrate diet those islet cells are\ngoing to shut off their production very\ninteresting I mean the liver is a very\nplastic tissue I mean it tends to\num react very dramatically to to\nLifestyle Changes yeah so that's why it\nwas interesting to see what happens\nmeans we know that even muscle issues\nfor example people who become bedridden\nthe loss of muscle mass but when they\ncome back and exercise they gain it back\nso it'll be interesting to see what\nhappens in these people who are going\nthrough long-term ketogenic diet and of\ncourse once in a while\nbecause of social pressure or something\nelse if they don't have access to food\nor something happens they may consume\nsome sugar some blood glucose will Spike\nbut it's not that every spike is bad I\nmean the reason why we have insulin is\nfor good reason to buffer that Spike to\nbuffer that Spike and also you know\npeople always say that well if you have\ninsulin produced or insulin like growth\nfactor those are really bad and it\nshould avoid that and I think that's a\nlittle bit extreme and I mean that's the\ninsulin growth factors involved in\nmuscle protein synthesis tissue repair\nyeah maybe even cognition so yeah yeah\nand it also goes back to\nas a m tour activation and all that\nstuff people get really excited about\nhow to reduce them to activation\nrapamycin and all that stuff so this is\nwhere\num again from circadian point of view\num I ask people to think okay so\ntwo very popular drug like molecules or\ndrugs that people think will increase\nlongevity or metformin which\nmany people agree not all will come to a\nconsensus that it activates\nMP kinase or the sensor and the cells\nthat sense that your cells are fasting\nso metformin kind of activates it so\nthat it kind of you can say although it\nmay not be scientifically accurate uh\nthe\num you know fasting and appeal so it\nsort of mimics fasting yeah and the and\nthe thing I'd lump in there with\nmetformin is that berberine is kind of\nthe Poor Man's metformin it's a tree\nbark extract that also dramatically\nlowers blood glucose yeah yeah and it\nmimics kind of that um fasting\nand then rapamycin\num also kind of reduces Emptor\nactivation\nand people have shown that\nrapamycin and Metformin\ncan extend\nMouse lifespan and in improve health\nokay\nso now let's go back to the calorie\nrestriction study that I mentioned\nin calorie restriction people are giving\nfood as a lump sum and they were\nessentially doing time restriction the\nmice were doing time restriction\nif we think about it\nduring day time when experimenters are\ncoming to the bivarium the mice should\nbe sleeping and fasting\nand they should naturally have high\nlevel of MP kinase if they're truly\nfasting and they should also have low\nlevel of interactivity because M2\nresponds to insulin and that should go\noff at night\nso my suspicion is\num in many of these experiments where\nthe mice were allowed to eat at Louis\nVuitton even normal standard Char now we\nare\nwe know that as mice get older they\nactually consume little bit more food\nduring day time which is the equivalent\nof human night humans nighttime it is\nlike nighttime eating we know is an\nissue I didn't realize that was more of\nan issue as people age but yeah so we\ndon't know but at least in mice because\nyou know we can put demise in\ncalorimetry look at every single by\ndieting how much they're eating\nso I guess it was natural to see that\nresearchers found that there is some\nmtor activity during day time when the\nmice were not supposed to have M3\nactivity because they should be fasting\nand since they ate little bit they were\nsnacking during day time amp kinase\nactivity was not at its peak\nso\ngiving metformin kind of\nmimic that fasting state\nand reducing M productivity by drug like\nrapamycin also kind of mimics some\naspect of the fasting state\nso my suspicion is\num since these studies were done always\nin mice\nwho are supposed to be in the fasting\nState and both enter sorry rapamycin and\nmpkin is activated or metformin kind of\nare mimicking that fasting State that's\nwhy we have seen those benefits\nand it will be interesting to see\nif that experiment will be done in\nhumans in the long term because many\npeople are very excited about you know\nthere is M total long-term metformin\nstudy and then a lot of people are\nactually consuming good amount of\nrapamycin off level they can get their\nown so that's my\ncuriosity I'm not saying whether it's\ngood or bad or whether there is science\nor not that's something that will be\ninteresting to control for and see\nbecause recently I saw one of my again\nclose friend and colleague at Scripps\nsuited a very simple elegant study\npeople should have done in metformin\nfield so it took mice and then measured\ntheir blood glucose at different time of\nthe day and in fact just like human\nblood Lookers our blood glucose\nfluctuates a little bit uh she saw that\nrhythm and then in every two hours or\nthree hours\num\non different days of course so you have\nthe same dose of Metformin to mice and\nwhat she found was a different time of\nthe day\nmetformin had very dramatic change in\nglucose reducing ability\nso which means that even if you take\nmetformin and give a different time of\nthe day for the mouse or even for humans\nin very long term of course in this mice\nthis mice were not diabetic or anything\nthey were healthy mice to begin with so\nin long term we might see\num benefits that are very different so\nthis brings to this idea that well maybe\nmetformin say\nat the end of the day evening metformin\nMay trigger that fasting State much\nearlier than end of digestion whereas\nmetformin in the beginning of the day\nmay not at least from longevity\nperspective I'm not talking about\nDiabetes Type 2 diabetes here\nso the same thing with Emptor\num is mtor going to have much better\nimpact if taken during evening morning\nbefore meal so\num these are my thoughts that go along\nwith all this fat um story that we\ntalked about\ndo you take Metformin or Burberry I know\nI haven't taken although you know um I\nhave close uh friend and colleague um\nRuben Shaw who is now the director of\nCancer Center at salki extensively works\non MP kinase and its mechanisms and\num\nso it's always fun to talk to him he's a\nhe's a fan yeah I've taken berberine\nbefore and I've had two different very\ndistinct experiences with them first of\nall\num berberine when ingested with\ncarbohydrates in particular\ncarbohydrates to have a lot of simple\nsugars definitely I know this because I\nmeasured my blood glucose I did the\nexperiment allows you to flatten out\nyour blood glucose response\nso you know in some sense if you're you\nknow there is this idea if you're going\nto eat a particularly big meal or sugary\nmeal and you don't want to get a massive\nblood glucose rise you take berberine or\nmetformin metformin is yeah prescription\nthat's I went with berberine because\nit's as far as I know it works as well\nyeah um at least for healthy people yeah\nfor healthy people that's right\num\nwhen I took berberine and did not ingest\nlarge amounts of simple sugars or\ncarbohydrates along with it I\nexperienced profound hypoglycemia I felt\nlike complete garbage for about eight\nhours and I had one of the worst\nheadaches of my life because which makes\nsense you just got a blood sugar crash\nso if you lower blood your blood sugar\nwhen you already have fairly low blood\nsugar and you're not ingesting\ncarbohydrates you can really bottom out\nyour your blood glucose so just say it's\nI say that as a for two reasons one is\nkind of a cautionary note and the other\none that um when you think about the\nbiology of these compounds it makes\nperfect sense and I think that\num and I did not pay attention to\ncircadian effects yeah yeah I mean you\nknow when I joined Salk um\nis the kind of the\num big liver and sick in metabolism and\nhe works on nuclear hormone receptors um\nthese are the master regulator of\nmetabolism and normal cells cancer cells\nand many other\nand what was interesting was in the\nfirst few years Ron did a very simple\nexperiment he just looked at what time\nof the day this nuclear hormone\nreceptors are turned on at gene\nexpression level and some are protein\nlevel and he found that almost all of\nthem\nhave a circadian pattern at least in\nsome tissue\nso he went to that length to say even\nthat circadian is metabolism and\nmetabolism is circadian the reason why\nwe have a circadian rhythm\nis to have a daily rhythms in food\nseeking behavior and eating\nand also go through a period of time\nwhen we should be fasting\nand then on the other hand\nall the metabolic Regulators also have\nto follow that rule and almost all\nmetabolic Regulators everything that we\ncan think of connected to\nmetabolizing macronutrient protein carb\nand fat they should also have a\ncircadian rhythm or diurnal cycle to\nalign or misalign so for example fat\noxidation should be in opposite phase\nwith feeding and\num\nyou know in retrospect at that time it\nwas kind of amazing to see Ron could\nforesee of course he's smart enough to\nforesee and predict that this is going\nto happen to circadian field because at\nthat time we're thinking about the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus sleep quick\ncycle and we are not thinking too much\nabout metabolism so that's the\nawesome thing about song being at Salt\nbecause we have 50 pis really crammed\ninto two awesome buildings and with Open\nLab structure so you bump onto each\nother and talk to you so and with an\nocean view oh it's awesome view yes it's\nan amazing place I was lucky enough to\nhave an adjunct position there when I\nwhen my lab was at UCSD and uh it is an\namazing Place doing incredible\ngroundbreaking work which of course\nincludes yours listen uh Sachin I I'm\nclear now that um we have to have you\nback on for another uh series of\ndiscussions seriously speaking if if\nyou'd be so so uh kind and willing to do\nthat I want to thank you for several\nthings first of all for your taking the\ntime today to sit down and discuss these\num incredibly interesting ideas in\ndetail you know much of what we talk\nabout on the podcast is uh obviously\ngrounded in science and and often but\nnot always as actionable and so much of\nwhat we talked about today\nis actionable in the sense that many\npeople are already doing certain\ndimensions of these things some are not\nsome are hearing about it and\nconsidering it you've given us dozens\nI've listed some out dozens of tools and\nconsiderations based on whether or not\npeople are engaging in shift work or not\nI think a lot of people are going to\nrealize that they are shift workers yeah\neven though they didn't think they were\num because of the nature of their habits\nnow to light and activity and so forth\num I absolutely love the firefighter\nstudy because of its relevance to the\ngeneral population\nalso not another nod to fighter fighters\nand shift workers everywhere thank you\nand you know I think among the\ncolleagues I've known for several\ndecades now you really are one of a very\nsmall few who've managed to do both\nanimal studies\nand human studies but also animal\nstudies with a very clear eye and a\npointer toward human health and um\nthat's such a vital and rare thing\nespecially in this day of\num extremely competitive funding so I\nwant to thank you for your time today\nfor the knowledge you share the\nactionable aspects of that knowledge the\nscience that you're doing in your\nlaboratory we will provide links for\npeople to learn more about you and of\ncourse to go to the app yeah um so\npeople can um engage in some of the\nscience directly and of course you have\nseveral wonderful books now that we will\nalso link to both of which I've read and\nare wonderful in particular the book\num the first book but also a book\nrelated to diabetes and um so for\ndiabetics and people interested in\nmetabolic and blood sugar regulation\num there so yeah on behalf of myself and\nmy team here at The huberman Lab podcast\nand all the listeners I just want to say\nthank you so much your time is valuable\nand the fact that you'd share it with us\nand educate so many people is really a\ngift yeah thank you and actually\nlikewise there are very few scientists\nwho have taken this leadership role that\nyou have taken to uh come and\ncommunicate science to the public it's\nnot easy because\nsometimes you have to distill it down to\na simple sound bite to the point where\nthe scientist and they'll say oh that\nmay not be right but we always have to\nkeep in mind that we are always living\nin the dark is of science because the\nreason why I say that this is not my\nquote actually this is from one of my\nscientific hero Paul simel from Scripps\nYola says think about it 10 years ago\nwhat do you what you thought was right\nand the best has already changed but one\nthing is the Circadian rhythm and\naligning it to our internal clock to our\nhabit is very important and as you\nmentioned uh we have our my security and\nclock app which is research facing but\nwe have also distilled all of this down\nto five or six timing component and we\nhave a new app called on time health or\nget on time Health to people access that\nthrough the standard app stores yeah so\nnow it's available in in app store uh\nsorry uh Apple App Store and we want to\nsee uh how because people always think\nabout fasting but as we discussed today\nfeeding fasting or eating fasting and\nactivity and sleep a kind of interlinked\nand we have to kind of balance both of\nthese so that's that was the idea behind\nthis on time health program and\num thank you Andy because what you're\ndoing is immensely necessary\nparticularly these days when science is\nmoving at a very past phase there are a\nlot of results coming out sometimes\nsomething can be very confusing and you\nspending your time\nto communicate science\nis exceptional so thank you well you're\nmost welcome it's um\ndays like today where I get to sit down\nand and talk to brilliant colleagues\nlike you who are doing the important\nwork that that really matters so much\nand so as you\num mentioned a moment ago that there's\nuh a lot of darkness and confusion out\nthere but uh thank you for being uh\none of those whose Shining Light\nthank you thank you for joining me for\ntoday's discussion with Dr Sachin Panda\nall about circadian biology and
