    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the huberman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine today's\nepisode marks the sixth and final of the\nsix episode series on fitness exercise\nand performance and today's discussion\nis all about nutrition and\nsupplementation to maximize your fitness\nexercise and performance goals Dr Andy\nGalpin I'm super excited to discuss\ntoday's topic which is nutrition and\nsupplementation for performance and\nrecovery and I'm particularly excited\nabout this conversation because I've\nbeen interested in supplementation and\nnutrition for performance really since\nmy teens but also because in recent\nyears we've witnessed a massive\ntransformation in the general public in\nterms of their view of supplementation\nand nutrition first of all more people\nare thinking about nutrition\nwhat is good nutrition what is not a\nvery barbed wire topic as you know but\nthere are some truths in there that\nwe'll discuss but also supplementation\nyou know whereas 10 15 years ago I think\nmost people um would either be really\ninto supplements that was a small\npercentage of people but the majority of\npeople were either told or were thinking\noh you know vitamins you mostly excrete\nthem they're just expensive urine\nnowadays it seems that many people\nincluding many of my colleagues and\nPhysicians all the way down to sports\nperformance experts\nare taking and making recommendations\nabout certain supplements and so the way\nthat I like to think about supplements\nis that they aren't necessarily just\nsupplements which makes it sound like\nthey are augmenting what should already\nbe there but you're not quite getting\nenough of but indeed a lot of these\nthings we call supplements are very\npotent compounds that can transform our\nability to perform in the short term to\nrecover from exercise and that can\nreally shape brain chemistry hormone\npatterns acutely and when taken long\nterm so I'm very excited about today's\ntopic and to be able to try and sort\nthrough this let's call it a cloud\nhopefully not a storm but this cloud of\nsupplements that are out there because\nindeed many of them are excellent and\ncan provide us a lot\nsome of them are terrible\nand then some just don't do anything and\ntherefore are terrible because either\nthey have side effects or because\nthey're very expensive and they don't do\nanything and then of course within the\nrealm of nutrition there's an equal\namount of of confusion but\nthat's why I'm talking to you because\nyou're going to put Clarity and\nstructure and definition on these\nincredibly important topics you you\nabsolutely nailed it there one of the\nmajor reasons supplements can work is\nbecause you can consume nutrients in\nextremely high concentrations such that\nyou would not get in nature through food\nhaving said that\nyou really do want to focus on the basic\nsleep nutrition hydration and I'm going\nto get into very specific detail later\nwith some of those things that said\nthere are plenty of situations and\ncircumstances when supplementation can\ndo exactly what you said\nalso though because you are taking them\nin such high concentrations\nthey can also be unproductive they can\nbe destructive or they can be\ncounterproductive so in case if you're\ntaking a couple of supplements over here\nit may actually be counteracting the\nbenefits of some of the other\nsupplements over there so in the ideal\nsituation we would be able to work like\nsnipers here so we would be able to run\nfull biological testing so extensive\nblood work and saliva and urine and\nstool and have an in-depth analysis of\nyour gut microbiome and your stress\npatterns and your time of day and your\ncortisol curve and like all the things\nthat we do in our high performance folks\nwith that then we can get extremely high\nPrecision supplementation and and quite\nhonestly our philosophy is we only give\nindividuals exactly what they need so\neven some of the standard uh generally\nsafe and effective supplements we don't\nreally necessarily use them if there's\nno specific need we've talked about the\nconsequences of this with things like\nantioxidants but even simple stuff like\nstimulants and other tools that are\neffective for Recovery we don't use them\nunless we have a reason\nthat said that's not the reality for a\nlot of people they're not going to be\nable to do something like that or\nsomebody who can help them in that so\nthere are a handful of supplements that\nI would consider to be in my my 80 20\nrule which is sort of like the 20 of\nsupplements that are going to give you\n80 of the benefit for the lowest cost\nand so what I can actually do is just\nsort of start there even though this\nlike burns my skin and my soul a little\nbit I absolutely hate this I am the\ncontext guy I'm the it it depends it's\nhigh Precision guy but let's be real um\nthere are a number of supplements that\nare fairly effective and fairly cheap\nfor a wide range of outcomes so this is\nfor general public this is for\npeople who want to do the three buckets\nright you want to look a certain way so\nsupplements that could enhance muscle\ngrowth and fat loss\nnon-hormonal based supplements of course\nsupplements that can improve energy or\nphysical performance again from\neverything from you know squatting more\nto feeling better in your yoga class to\nhaving more energy throughout the day to\nour third major bucket that we've been\ntalking about throughout this entire\nseries which are longevity so we can\ncover those first if you'd like to start\nthere yes absolutely let's start there\noftentimes when we think of supplements\nwe immediately jump to High Sport\nperformance type of things or vigorous\nworkouts or muscle building though that\ndoesn't necessarily have to be the case\ntake for example creatine and I've\nspoken about this at lengthens with\nDarren kandow who's done a tremendous\namount of research I was just up at his\nlab recently in Canada and he has\ncovered extensively in fact I think I\nput up a post perhaps I could draw this\nup um\nwhere he laid out all the Myriad of\nbenefits of creatine this is taken in\nthe you know typically three to five\ngrams per day of dose of creatine\nmonohydrate which has the most research\nbehind it seems to be extremely low side\neffects\nin almost anyone and the benefits\nincluding course things like muscle\nperformance and strength and things like\nthat and if you go back to our\ndiscussion and our episode on metabolism\nand endurance we talked about the\nphosphoryl creatine system so you can\nfigure out kind of what this is going to\ndo in terms of effect that said there's\nexcellent information and data coming\nout and all on the benefits of bone\nmineral density and creatine there's a\nton of work looking at a host of\ncognitive factors from memory executive\nfunction\nto effects potentially on even things\nlike depression\nmood to alzheimer's Parkinson's uh\nall forms of neurodegenerative disease\nin fact it's it's pretty obvious the\nbrain loves creatine as a fuel and so\nnot only we sort of discussed in the\nepisode as being the fuel for skeletal\nmuscle contraction but the brain needs\nto do that as well the astrocytes are on\nthe brain need to be able to provide\nenergy Etc so it's very clear that\nmetabolism in the brain is reduced with\nthings like TBI and potentially\nconcussions so\num now to be extremely clear\ncreatine does not prevent any of those\ndiseases it does not treat any of them\nand the data are mixed but it's more and\nmore are coming some show a little bit\nof benefits I'm showing you know maybe\nnone but I'm not aware of any research\nin those areas that show it has any\ndownside\nfor the most part side effects are\nextremely minimal if not null and then\npotentially some benefit and depending\non the specific study so we could put up\na if you'd like a couple of links\ndirectly to those meta-analyzes and\nfolks can go through those things one by\none so\num I only say that to again maybe expand\nour understanding or thinking about what\nthese types of supplements can do it's\nnot just about growing muscle\nor you know high performance it's\neverything to again there's an\nassociation with recovery so creatine is\nfantastic for recovery for muscle for\nmuscle damage it helps and can\npotentially Aid in fat loss and a whole\nhost of things so you can actually also\neven look at websites like examine.com I\nhave you know no affiliation with them\nwhatsoever but if you want to just type\nin something like creatine monohydrate\nyou can see a whole list and you're\ngoing to see thousands of studies of the\npotential benefits of creatine so that\nis is always number one on my list I'm\nrelieved to hear that creatine sits at\nthe top of your supplementation list\nbecause well first of all I started\ntaking it when I was in college at that\ntime I was taking it in this kind of\nloading mode where you take it in um you\nknow anywhere from uh 15 to 25 grams per\nday often causing some gastric distress\noften combining with fruit juice to try\nand shuttle it into the muscles sure and\nthen so-called maintenance phase of\nreducing to 10 or 15 grams per day now\ndays I just take about five grams or so\nalthough later I know you're gonna tell\nme why I should probably be taking more\nthan five grams per day given my body\nweight so I know we'll get into some of\nthose specifics a little bit later but\nin addition to experiencing Direct\neffects on muscle size and strength\nwhich I did I don't know how it\ncontributed to my cognitive function or\nif it does now because there's really no\nway to tease that out with with standard\nat home tests like a scale but\nit is very clear to me based on the\nliterature that you described and some\nof which we've covered on other episodes\nof the podcast that the phospho creatine\nsystem is vitally important for\nforebrain function right the forebrain\nof course being the the portion of brain\nbroadly speaking the portion of brain\njust behind your forehead that is\nresponsible for planning action setting\nrules and context so even as simple as\nif you're going downfield in a game of\nsoccer or basketball and you're on\noffense and then uh you make an attempt\non goal or basket and then it switches\nand you go back now you're on defense\nthat being on defense is very different\nthan being on offense and that goal\nexcuse me that that rule switching is a\nprefrontal cortical function as is every\ncontext dependent way of thinking or\nacting and so anything that can favor\nfunction of the forebrain I think is\ngood for uh humans in general it\nsuppresses anxiety allows us to\ninterpret what's going on for us and so\nI'm very\num relieved and gratified to hear that\ncreatine sits at the top of the list\nalso as I'm sure you'll point out again\nlater creatine is for the most part a\nrelatively affordable supplement for\nmost people so here we're not talking\nabout something that's really esoteric\nor that you have to you know fly to some\nremote location to get an infusion of\nright um but although I apologize to all\nyou because I know the price has\nskyrocketed recently really yeah why is\nthat I think it's just well nobody knows\nbut it's quote unquote Supply and uh\ndemand issue if you will so those prices\nhave gone up there's also of course been\nshipping problems in the world and\nthings so uh every time I talk about\ncreatine right now people just flame me\nfor like oh my God it's so expensive now\nI'm like I know I'm sorry but honestly\nit's only so expensive because you're\nused to being so cheap\nso when you when you counter the fact\nthat you're like right yeah like\nrelative to the other stuff you're\nprobably taking relative to any other\nnumber of purchases\num for the it still lands very high in\nmy Roi List my you know my 80 20 because\nof that it's\num it can be taken any time of the day\nit doesn't have to be in magical\ncombination you talked about\nco-ingesting with carbohydrates that can\nenhance uh how quickly you can get into\nthe system in fact it's it's going to\nwork on the exact same mechanisms will\nprobably potentially talk about\nhydration but these things are shuttled\nso anytime you bring in carbohydrate\nthat's going to\nbe shipped into tissue as quickly as it\ncan creatine then goes along super ride\nand then it brings water into the right\nthat's how you enhance hydration that's\nwhy it's important to have carbohydrates\nwhen you're trying to hydrate so you're\njust going to take it in there and\nthat's also why you get quote-unquote\ncell swelling which is a good thing like\nyou're it's just enhancing hydration we\nactually use it a ton in our post way in\nprotocols so and individuals that have\nto cut water weight creatine is a great\nthing to throw back in there it's going\nto help you rehydrate it's also why when\nyou take 30 grams of it it can pull a\nbunch of fluid in the intestines and and\nthere you go with your little bit of GI\ndistress so\num yeah there's a lot of fun things you\ncan talk about there I just had to flag\nthat because every time I've been\ntalking about it recently and I say it's\ncheap people are killing me for it so I\napologize I don't know how to make it\nany cheaper but it's still fairly fairly\naffordable yeah I would say relatively\ninexpensive compared to a lot of\nsupplements out there and when thinking\nabout the return on investment is um\nit's quite good yeah so like actually\nsorry it started to cut you out but I\nwas also thinking there's been a number\nof studies on sleep deprivation as well\nwith creatine that can help so obviously\nsleep deprivation will generally reduce\ncognitive function and creatine can\nameliorate some of that drop so if you\nthink about it in that context I had a\ncrummy night of sleep well and if that\nenables you to perform a little bit\nbetter in your job then you would make\nup the dollar or so whatever you paid\nfor that day's supply of creatine so it\nis something kind of on that note\nit's not going to work as an acute\nresponse so it's not something you're\nlike I feel terrible let me throw some\ncreatine Down the Hatch I'll feel better\nthat's not going to work it's going to\ntake several weeks to have a noticeable\neffect it needs to be stored in tissue\nit needs to be built up before you can\nactually do much of anything so it is\nunlike some of the other things like\nstimulants or caffeine that have an\nacute you know response right now\nand so if you're going to take it you\nprobably need to consume it consistently\nif you can't do that then really there's\nno point in doing it and the loading\nphase you mentioned distance were here\nis something you can do again if you\nneed to enhance the storage of it really\nquickly so say for example\nwe've done this in some military cases\nwhere it's like you get back to base and\nyou've only got a week and you got to go\nback out we may actually have to do a\nlittle bit of a loading phase then but\nif that's not the case the loading phase\nis unnecessary it's not really harmful\nother than maybe GI stress and maybe\nwaste but you're going to have three or\nfour weeks it's going to reach full\nsaturation plenty of time to to be there\nin that if you're in that three to seven\ngrams per day range I'm glad you\nmentioned the slow accumulating positive\neffects of creatine as compared to\nso-called acute effects because the way\nthat I think of Health promoting and\nperformance enhancing protocols like\nviewing morning sunlight or\num endurance exercise for that matter or\ncreatine\nor sleep for instance is that while they\ncan have effects in the immediate term\nyou might feel a little bit or in the\ncase of a good night's sleep a lot\nbetter it's really the accumulative\neffect of raising your Baseline level of\nfunctioning you know there's another way\nto think about it is\num these\nsupplements or behaviors and quality\nnutrition when done consistently over\ntime and that doesn't mean 100 of the\ntime but you know because probably 80 of\nthe time sure\nlead to a sort of uh buoyancy in your\nsystem that allows you to be more\nresilient under conditions where\nconditions aren't perfect right and if\nconditions are made perfect or close to\nperfect and you already have that\nbuoyancy that's when you really start to\nsee the ultra high performance effects\num that are so much fun but they have to\nbe established through consistent\nsupplementation consistent nutritional\nintake so today I know we're going to\ndistinguish between uh normally they're\ncalled chronic and acute effects but\nthat makes it sound like chronic illness\nthe moment people hear chronic well they\nmight think of other things but but in\nthe context of Health they typically\nthink of you know chronic illness and\nwe're not talking about that what we're\ntalking about is slow modulatory effects\nin the body a lot of things in the body\ntake time to build up but once they've\nbuilt up they they clearly can benefit\nus and then other things as you\nmentioned you know a stimulant for\ninstance has a very acute effect that\nit's going to occur with you know Peak\nwithin 30 minutes and wear off within\nyou know four hours or so can also have\nsome chronic effects but typically it's\na short-lived effect so we just want to\nframe up the the language that we'll be\nusing and I'm really excited to dive\ninto this topic and I think creatine is\na beautiful example of a supplement that\nhas positive chronic mental and physical\nbenefits down the road I can come back\nand talk a little bit more about\ncreatine and we can cover some other\ninformation regarding best practices for\nfor getting the most out of it as well\nas we'll certainly dive into some of the\ncommon side effects or at least a\nthought of side effects while we're here\nthough I also could throw in a few other\nof these high impact low-cost generally\nsafe things that are my 80 20 rule if\nyou will so the way I actually kind of\nthink about it is you want one from each\nof three categories and these categories\nare fuel\nstimulants\nand fatigue blockers so creatine is\nactually in the fuel it's not a\nstimulant as we talked about The Chronic\neffect there so we've already knocked\nthat one off another one from the\nfatigue blocker\nis going to be anything like beta\nalanine or sodium bicarbonate and then\nfrom the stimulant yeast of course we\nhave anything like a beetroot juice to a\ncaffeine or something of the equivalent\nso we can come back again and talk about\nall those in more detail a little bit\nlater before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is also separate from Dr\nAndy galpin's teaching and research\nroles at Cal State Fullerton it is\nhowever part of our desire and effort to\nbring zero cost to Consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public in keeping with\nthat theme we'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast our first\nsponsor is momentous momentous makes\nsupplements of the absolute highest\nquality the huberman Lab podcast is\nproud to be partnering with momentous\nfor several important reasons first of\nall as I mentioned their supplements are\nof extremely high quality second of all\ntheir supplements are generally in\nsingle ingredient formulations if you're\ngoing to develop a supplementation\nprotocol you're going to want to focus\nmainly on using single ingredient\nformulations with single ingredient\nformulations you can devise the most\nlogical and effect active and\ncost-effective supplementation regimen\nfor your goals in addition momentous\nsupplement ship internationally and this\nis of course important because we\nrealize that many of the huberman Lab\npodcast listeners reside outside the\nUnited States if you'd like to try the\nvarious supplements mentioned on the\nhuberman Lab podcast in particular\nsupplements for Hormone Health for Sleep\noptimization for Focus as well as a\nnumber of other things including\nexercise recovery you can go to live\nmomentous spelled ous so that's live\nmomentous.com huberman today's episode\nis also brought To Us by levels levels\nis a program that lets you see how\ndifferent foods and activities affect\nyour health by giving you real-time\nfeedback on your blood glucose using a\ncontinuous glucose monitor many people\nare aware that their blood sugar that is\ntheir blood glucose level is critical\nfor everything from Fat Loss to muscle\ngain to healthy cognition and indeed\naging of the brain and body most people\ndo not know however how different foods\nand different activities including\nexercise or different temperature\nenvironments impact their blood glucose\nlevels and yet blood glucose is\nexquisitely sensitive to all of those\nthings I first started using levels\nabout a year ago as a way to understand\nhow different foods exercise and timing\nof food relative to exercise and quality\nof sleep at night impact my blood\nglucose levels and I've learned a\ntremendous amount from using levels it's\ntaught me when best to eat what best to\neat when best to exercise how best to\nexercise and how to modulate my entire\nschedule from work to exercise and even\nmy sleep so if you're interested in\nlearning more about levels and trying a\ncontinuous glucose monitor yourself go\nto levels.link huberman that's\nlevels.link huberman today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by element element is\nan electrolyte drink that contains the\nexact ratios of the electrolyte sodium\nmagnesium and potassium to optimize\ncellular functioning for mental and\nphysical performance most people realize\nthat hydration is key we need to ingest\nenough fluids in order to feel our best\nand perform our best but what most\npeople do not realize is that the pro\nupper functioning of our cells and nerve\ncells neurons in particular requires\nthat sodium magnesium and potassium be\npresent in the correct ratios now of\ncourse people with pre-hypertension and\nhypertension need to be careful about\ntheir sodium intake but what a lot of\npeople don't realize is that if you\ndrink caffeine if you exercise and in\nparticular if you're following a very\nclean diet that is not a lot of\nprocessed foods which of course is a\ngood thing chances are you're not\ngetting enough sodium potassium and\nmagnesium to optimize mental and\nphysical performance element contains a\nscience-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams\nthat's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams\nof potassium and 60 milligrams of\nmagnesium and no sugar if you'd like to\ntry element you can go to drink element\nthat's lmnt.com huberman to get a free\nelement sample pack with your purchase\nagain that's drink element lmnt.com\nhuberman to claim a free sample pack to\nstart off I want to ask you about\nsomething that as soon as I say it some\npeople might roll their eyes or wonder\nwhy are we even talking about that now\nbut that I have to believe is among the\nmore fundamental if not foundational\naspects of nutrition and supplementation\nfor performance and that's hydration\nright I mean I think we hear hydration\nit's like okay we have to drink six to\neight glasses of water every day our\nurine should be relatively clear if it's\ntoo dark yellow we're not doing a good\njob of hydrating enough\nhow much of that is true\num is alkaline water worthwhile for\nchanging the alkalinity of my body I\nlearned when I was in college and\ngraduate school that the alkalinity of\nthe different tissues in your body is\nvery well controlled in order to keep\nyou alive and that you don't want it to\nshift too much or you can enter pretty\nhorrible states of seizure vomiting and\neven death so\ntell me about hydration and woven into\nthat if you would\neducate me on electrolytes and hydration\nbecause I think most often when people\ningest electrolytes sure they could be\ningesting salt tablets\nthey're probably getting some\nelectrolytes by the way electrolyte\nsodium magnesium potassium\nthrough their food I think most people\nthink about drinking electrolytes so\nwater and electrolytes I think is a\nvitally important topic to kick this off\nwith sure we can jump right into your\nalkaline water while there's perhaps\nmuch to say about this we can\nmaybe revisit this in another seven part\nseries all on its own uh I would just\nsay it this way\nthere's probably a few things you should\ndo before worrying about the alkalinity\nof your water and I'll just leave it at\nthat\nmeaning the alkalinity of the water is\nsort of irrelevant not that you won't go\nthat far is just it's probably remember\nwe started started off talking about 80\n20. well this would be in my like 99 one\nin terms of like if we're really at the\nlevel of worrying about the pH of your\ndrinking fluid we have optimized so many\nother things that then we can talk about\nit but until we have nailed months and\nyears of work on other things this is\njust not going to make much of an impact\ngreat then perhaps you could tell us\nabout what volume of water we should be\ndrinking when we should be drinking that\nwater relative to training and just\ngenerally and\num yeah and anything else relate to\nwater and electrolytes that can improve\nmental Performance Physical performance\nand offset any you know ill effects I\nlike the fact that you mentioned\nphysical and mental performance because\nit's clear in both cases we hear that we\nneed to drink more water and I can give\nyou some numbers and I will in a second\nwhat we also need to recognize is\nthere's this is hormesis we talked about\nhormesis a few episodes ago and this is\nthe case right whether we talked about\nfood or hydration or I think I gave you\nthe example of cyanide\nnaturally occurring in your food hot\nwater is the same way so if you are\nunder hydrated or dehydrated then there\nis a clear negative effect on your body\nand as I increase the level or improve\nthe level of hydration things get better\nwhether this are physical performance or\nwhether this is mental performance in\nfact we know that a body weight\nreduction of as low as two percent via\ndehydration so imagine you're doing a\nbout of exercise and you're sweating and\nyou lose two percent of your body weight\nthat alone is enough to reduce accuracy\nand performance so the classic study we\ntalk about here was in basketball\nplayers so shooting accuracy so free\nthrow shooting I think is specifically\nwhat they looked at\nsignificant reduction in performance\nwith as little as two percent\ndehydration that that level you also see\na significant increase in perception of\ndifficulty of exercise and so only right\nat two percent\nand again when I say two percent I mean\npercent body weight lost right that's\nwhat that means you start getting the\nthree four five percent dehydration you\nstart having a significant reduction in\nblood volume and that's incredibly\nimportant for endurance\num your blood becomes viscous it gets\nhard to pump through\num and you're going to start having all\nkinds of issues so being dehydrated is\nagain not only going to reduce\nperformance but because of the mental\naspect which we just walked through and\nneuromuscular issue you're going to lose\naccuracy you're going to lose total\nendurance performance and you're going\nto lose speed and power so we have the\nTriad there no matter what you're\ninterested in it's going to be harmed by\nbeing dehydrated that also is happening\nthen if you're starting your program\ndehydrated so if you're already one\npercent or so dehydrated maybe you're\nlike a little under hydrated and you\nlose a little bit of sweat you've\nalready hit that two percent and so\nwe're starting to see reductions um in\nperformance there the same happens on\nthe other side of that hormetic curve so\nif you are optimally hydrated in some\nlarge window\nbut you start going past that we can\nstart running into equal problems\nremember there's a there is a need for\nan optimal concentration of sodium and\npotassium and chloride between your cell\ninside your cell and outside your cell\nthese are electrolytes this is what we\ncall osmolality and osmolarity is really\ngoing to think of it like concentration\nand osmosis if you remember those terms\nso if we are trying to create a muscle\ncontraction that requires an electrical\ngradient and so sodium and potassium\nspecifically in magnesium calcium are\npositively charged and chloride is\nnegatively charged and we need to have a\ncertain amount inside the cell and\noutside the cell so that the positives\nand the negatives are balanced\nappropriately so that when we move one\nwe change the voltage and we have in the\ncase of a muscle contraction\nokay I just came through a whole lot of\nphysiology there to say if you then go\nmess with fluid only and you say if I\nwere to give you a bolus of you know\nthree liters of pure water right now\nyou're going to dilute your blood and so\nthere's not going to be as many chemical\nuh there won't be as many electrical\nsignals in there because you've taken\nthe same amount of sodium potassium Etc\nand put it in a larger volume of pure\nwater so that gradient has now changed\nthat becomes a significant problem\nfor contraction I mean quite literally\nit can kill you this is what we call\nhyponatremia so notremia spelled n a\nhypo being low\nhyponatremia if you actually go to the\nPeriodic Chart n a is what we use for\nsodium so hypernetes because the word is\nnatremia actually so that what that\nliterally means is low sodium and you\ndidn't get that from sweating out all\nyour sodium you actually get\nhyponatremia from drinking in too much\nwater so it's not that the total amount\nof sodium gets low it's the fact that\nthe concentration gets low from\nexcessive fluid intake so in the\nExtremes in fact if you look at the\nliterature you'll see anywhere between\nlike two to fifteen percent of people\nwho finish endurance races are are into\nhyponatremia now that varies wildly if\nyou're doing Iron Man and Kona versus\nlike you know the marathon in Denver in\nin October right it's going to be\ntotally different depending on weather\nconditions but these are all important\nso while like death happens that is sort\nof extreme if you back up just a little\nbit you start seeing the same types of\nperformance sacraments in fact the\nsymptoms can be identical brain fog\nconfusion performance uh irritation a GI\ndistress and you think man these are\nsymptoms of dehydration so then you\ndrink more water and you're just\nexacerbating the problem and I can\nactually\num give you one little example of this\nwe had an executive actually female CEO\nuh I'll say she's probably when I was in\nher early 40s\nand so she came to us and she thought\nman for sure she has some sort of gut\nproblem going on because we hear a lot\nabout kind of like gut health and how it\naffects everything and so she's just\nlike I have brain fog and I've done all\nthese things and I got blood work done\nand everything's fine like nothing's\ngoing on I think I must have some sort\nof gut thinger going on or whatever and\nit's okay and we just started going\nthrough her stuff and uh she was I think\nabout 170 pounds plus or minus and she\nwas consuming like 250 to 60 ounces of\nwater a day\nthat's a ton of water and we were like\nholy what are you doing this for\nand she says like that's sort of like my\nthing it was but she didn't realize it\nwas more of like a nervous tick than it\nwas anything else right she just like\nsips of sip sip sip water I'm like man\nhow often do you go pee and she's like\nyeah like every you know 30 minutes or\nsomething I'm like fantastic sleep\nproblems focused and so she's smashing\ncaffeine she was at like eight cups of\ncoffee a day which is also going to add\nto excretion of sodium\ntotally right\nso it's like okay we don't really need\nto come in and run a sleep study on you\nwe're just going to lower your water and\nshe was like what yeah we dropped her\ndown to like 180 so basically an ounce\nper pound of body weight which is still\nhigh because she did train 180 ounces\ncorrect yeah she does work out so she\nneeded to replenish some stuff and we'll\ncover these numbers in a second\ninstantaneously I mean like two days in\nshe's like oh my God I haven't slept six\nto eight hours in years and then after\nthat it was like basically tears coming\nback to us right my focus my brain fog\nis gone because she's in a very high\npressure job\num it's like everything's coming back\nlike now she was down to three or so\ncups off a day like the whole thing\ndigestion improved all of it she was\nsick like to her only problem after all\nthe analyzes was she was just drinking\nway way too much water and adding more\nsalt to her\nwould not have solved the problem\nbecause she would have just had simply\nway too much fluid in her system she was\nhaving all kinds of ADH problems and\naldosterone like the whole thing and\nthen that that rolls into cortisol\nthe whole like system gets goes into\nchaos so it is important that you pay\nattention hydration even though as you\nsort of mentioned people tend to just\nkind of like roll their eyes around it\nbecause if you're in the middle it's\nfine but if you're anywhere past not\neven the extreme extremes but just that\nfirst standard deviation away you're\ngoing to have problems and you might be\nthinking adrenal fatigue you might be\nthinking you're testing like you're\ngoing to think all these things and you\nsimply just haven't actually dialed in\nyour hydration yeah uh I think people\nsometimes roll their eyes at the\ndiscussion of hydration because it just\ndoesn't sound very sexy it's not like\ndoesn't sound like a neurotransmitter or\na hormone it doesn't sound like\ntestosterone or estrogen or DHEA or\ndopamine but it actually is all of those\nthings it sits at a level beneath all of\nthose but not beneath on a hierarchy\nbeneath in in terms of a foundation it's\nactually the without\nproper electrolyte balance and hydration\nnone of the cells of the body can\nfunction and then I think people also\nhear that oh you know we are 70 water\nand somehow like it that statistic Alone\num or that fact alone doesn't seem to uh\nstimulate any kind of action will take\naway right it's like great you know uh\nlike gravity also you know keeps us you\nknow from jumping his eyes we like you\nknow what do I do and so I think\num it's it's important that people\nunderstand that every cellular process\nin the body critically relies on having\nenough sodium magnesium potassium around\nand the the way that it's concentrated\nin fluid water is really the way that\nyou allow every cell in their body to\nfunction as well as it possibly could\nand respond to all the sorts of kind of\nquote unquote High Performance Tools\nthat we're talking about the other thing\nI've observed many times over is that if\npeople are ingesting too much water and\nalso drinking a lot of caffeine and\ntheir electrolytes are low they get\nshaky and they actually can have anxiety\nlike symptoms so when people come into\nmy lab to do studies on anxiety and fear\nwe ask a few questions and those\nquestions include how much water they've\nhad that day also a sort of bizarre fact\nbut one that I think is worth mentioning\nis that when the bladder is full it\nstimulates a sort of anxiety if you ever\nhad to urinate very badly and you're in\nthe car or you can't urinate and then\nyou get to the door like that's talk\nabout anxiety\num and that's because there's a direct\nneural pathway from the bladder that\nregisters the mechanosensors how much\nstretch there is on the bladder that\nsends a signal to the brain stem\nalertness\nareas broadly speaking Locus ceruleus\nand others that wake us up these are the\nwhen we're awake it makes us more awake\nand when we're asleep this is what wakes\nus up to urinate in the middle of the\nnight yeah that's actually why you can\nuse uh night urination as a pretty good\ndiagnostic of sleep disorders\nso if because of vasopressin right\nalmost exactly what you're talking about\nif you're having sleep disorder issues\nand you're staying awake and a\nvasopressin gets taken off right an APN\ngoes straight to the kidneys your\nkidneys are supposed to be dormant\nbasically at night you're not supposed\nto be filtering a lot and producing a\nlot of urine at night if that's\nhappening and say you you have any\nnumber of apneas kicking on or anything\ngoing on vasopressin keeps going keep\nsending signal kidneys start filtering\nso if you're waking up and peeing\nmultiple times a night that's called\nnocturia that is a very very good sign\nthat either one of two things happen you\none you have some sort of sleep disorder\nor two you're drinking outrageous\namounts of water and so that's actually\na bit of a backward cycle now right\nbecause you're drinking way too much\nwater you're waking up and peeing all\nnight that's actually ruining your sleep\nand so we have seen this a number of\ntimes with our sleep company as we go in\nand it's just like you don't need any of\nthis crap you just need to be properly\nhydrated alternatively if your hydration\nis sound and you're still waking up more\nthan one time a night to pee on average\nthen you almost well I shouldn't say\nlike that but there's a potential that\nyou actually have some sort of sleep\nsystem or sleep condition going in so\nthe rule of thumb on that is so we're\nhere once or night once a night or so of\nurination is fine if it is routinely or\nconsistently more than two you need to\nmake some adjustments start with\nhydration it's the simplest way right\ngetting a full sleep study done just\nfigure out hydration we've had this\nhappen\na number of times where people want to\nget more health conscious and they just\nget they hear things like this and\nthey're like I gotta get on my water and\nthen they just start train wrecking\ntheir sleep and then waking it up so if\nyou're waking up multiple times and\nyou're urinating and it is a large\namount of urine for you and it is clear\nthat's probably not sleep apne induced\nnoctria that's probably excessive\nhydration if you're waking up a bunch of\ntimes and it's fairly small amounts of\nurine then it's probably not the fluid\nissue it's probably the fact that the\nvasopressin is kicking your kidneys into\ngear so that's not a perfect criteria\nbut it's just like a quick little tool\nyou can sort of use that's actually one\nof the reasons why we measure almost\nalways your body weight at night\nas well as in the morning so that that's\nlike the combat sport in the UFC\nfighters boxers we call that your float\nso how much you floated overnight I like\nto know that number because I want to\nknow as well your first morning void so\nwhen you wake up then you went to bed at\n200 pounds you woke up the next morning\nat 195. it's like oh you floated five\npounds\ndid you pee last night yeah yeah three\ntimes\ninteresting another case you woke up you\nwent to bed at 200 pounds you wake up at\n199.5\nokay you're dehydrated because you\nshould have a a certain amount of fluid\nthat you're just Whispering out as\nyou're breathing throughout your nose\nthroughout night ideally uh guaranteed\nyou're gonna wake up what was your urine\nlike oh yeah a little bit pretty dark\nlike shocker you're dehydrated so you\ncan kind of look at numbers like that a\ngeneral float is something like a pound\nto two pounds for the 170 plus pound\nperson as you scale up that number then\ngo up a little bit but you can kind of\nuse these to triage a little bit about\nwhat's going on\num with this kind of combination\neverything is everything right so it's\nlike it's not just about one system so\nyou're gonna pay attention you can also\nlook uh well I don't if you don't jump\ninto it we can but there's a whole bunch\nof ways I can teach you to diagnose\nhydration and maybe we can start there\nand then we can talk about hydration\nnumbers yes I'd love to talk about\ndiagnostics for hydration over hydration\ndehydration\nto start off would you be willing to\ngive us some numbers how much water\nshould we be drinking the classic rule\nhere and you're making me do what I hate\nright I want to give all the caveats\nfirst but I'll go straight to your\nnumber half an ounce per pound of body\nweight is a rough rule so if you weigh\nagain 200 pounds that would mean you\ndrink 100 ounces of water a day most\nwater bottles are like 12 to 20 ounces\nsomething like that so you know you end\nup drinking six of those or so a day\nkind of like plus or minus which is not\nthat unreasonable\nthis does depend on a number of factors\nwhich I could go over but that is a\nrough starting place the only other\nthing to add to that is that does not\naccount for exercise induced water loss\nor sauna or anything like that so that's\nassuming just like basal daily needs if\nyou are exercising or sweating at all\nfor any reasons or work related so folks\nthat work outside are in the Heat or\na human environment these numbers all\nchange and you can slide this scale up\nbut you generally want to drink about\n125 percent\nof the fluids you've lost during that\nphysical activity back and how much do\nyou lose per hour of exercise that\nnumber ranges between one to five pounds\ndepending on the person it can even be\nhigher with some of our athletes like I\ncan think of a number of NFL players\nright now it's not uncommon for those\nguys to do eight or nine pounds even not\neven like crazy circumstances if it's\nAugust and we're in Jacksonville\nit's not wild for us those guys go nine\nten pounds but what about the typical\nperson who goes to a air-conditioned gym\nor goes out for a run on a day that is\nsomewhere between let's say 55 degrees\nFahrenheit and 85 degrees Fahrenheit\nyou're probably looking at like a pound\nit's not extremely high if you are\ntotally soaked\nmight be like a pound and a half to two\npounds if you're like come back and like\nyour pits are a little sweaty and\nthere's a little bit of water kind of on\nyour neckline it's probably like a more\nlike a pound or so so in that case you\nmight drink back a pound and a half of\nwater okay so just to review these\nnumbers to make sure that I'm\non the correct page here\na half an ounce of fluid per pound of\nbody weight is a sort of a foundation\nfor hydration\nand then\nyou want to replace a hundred and twenty\nfive percent of the fluid lost during\nexercise and exercise\nvaries where exercise is done varies\nwhether or not people are wearing\nuniforms or helmets is going to impact\nhow much fluid they lose Etc\nin a very hot environment that the\namount of fluid lost can be anywhere\nfrom you know one to five maybe even ten\npounds easy per hour of hard hard\nexertion for most exercise done in\nconditions of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to\n72 excuse me 85 degrees Fahrenheit done\nwith some degree of effort one might\nlose a pound or or two pounds of water\nsuper easy way to find out all you have\nto do is weigh yourself naked\ngo do your workout come back in dry off\nweigh yourself naked that'll tell you\nexactly what you lost so if you went in\nyou were 160 pounds you come back out\nyou wait you're 158 you lost two pounds\ndrink back two and a half pounds of\nwater you're good so that is uh is that\nhonestly it's like fairly gold standard\nfor identifying you can actually buy a\nwhole bunch of technology for this and\nthey are using the exact same equation\nwhich is your body weight\nwhen you were there now if you do that\nthough you do need to account for any\nfluid you drink during the workout sure\nbecause that then offsets it\nsimple but I think important question\nwe're talking about a half an ounce of\nfluid per pound of body weight does that\ninclude things like coffee tea soda\npre-workout drinks mid-workout drinks uh\nmate matcha whatever the you know\nthere's a yerba mate there's a there are\na million things out there\num or just\nwater any fluid for the most part is\ngoing to count\nand is it true that fluids that contain\ncaffeine\ngenerally cause us to secrete sodium\nyeah\nokay so do you recommend including\nelectrolyte powder or a small pinch of\nsodium or any number of other supplement\ntype electrolytes that can replace that\nsodium magnesium and potassium a couple\nof things we have to pay attention to\naccurately answer that question\nwell you also sort of asked about you\nmay have not even realize is does\ncaffeine actually enhance dehydration\nwhich is not really what you asked but\nit's probably a lot of people thought\nthat as well so caffeine can\nbut coffee doesn't necessarily do that\nbecause remember you're co-ingesting\nthat with fluid and so uh we used to say\nthat all the time how coffee dehydrates\nyou it doesn't it might make your urine\nyellow that certainly gives off a odor\nin your urine but in general coffee will\nnot do that because you're just if you\nwere to now be taking caffeine pills\nalone now there is a bit of a diuretic\neffect there and so you're going to year\nand how much\nmaybe not enough for you to be really\nconcerned with especially when you\nbalance that against the ergogenic\neffects and benefits of caffeine it's\nnot something we are concerned about\nsecond part of your question do you need\nto then offset the loss\nof sodium I'm not super concerned about\nthe amount of sodium lost to caffeine I\nam more concerned about simply the\namount of sodium being correct\nbecause of the bigger circumstances like\nhow much is actually in your system and\nhow much you lost\nin the training session so it's not the\ncaffeine that I care about that much\nrelative to you know if you lost three\ngrams of sodium because of the training\nand you added another few milligrams\nbecause the caffeine I don't really care\nor didn't I'm glad you brought up the\ndifference between a substance like\ncaffeine and the vehicle It's contained\nin like coffee this is all really\nimportant and it also raises a question\nabout individual differences in sweating\nability and I call it sweating ability\nbecause I have a good friend I've known\nfor ages really\num actually work with him in my\nlaboratory as well and he's one of these\npeople that the moment he starts any\nphysical activity it's like a flood\nwarning right he just soaks through\nclothing it's just the sweating\nadaptation is is exceedingly robust in\nhim other people less so so is it true\nthat sweating in our ability to dump\nheat through it by loss of water is\nsomething that um we tend to vary on and\nthat also that we can build up that\ncapacity I know a number of people are\nprobably thinking ew gross why would I\nwant to sweat more but there's actually\na huge advantage to be able to dump body\nheat during exertion because body heat\nin some ways sets the cap for\nperformance a lot many many ways\nincluding mental performance\nis stay alert often is enhanced by being\ncold and of course we all want to warm\nup properly but\num in terms of loss of fluid through\nsweating is there a way to easily bin\nourselves into kind of a low sweater\nmedium sweater heavy sweater that sounds\nlike an article of clothing but in any\ncase you know what I'm you know man\nanother a lot to say here we should wish\nwe had a whole series on this listen if\nwe have to go 17 hours we can do it just\neverybody hydrate well I think we've\nshown the listeners uh that is a real\nthreat\nthat's a very real threat podcasting to\nfailure you don't have to do every set\nin the gym to failure but here we are\nattempting a podcast failure in it in\nall seriousness\num what what is the role of\nsweating ability and is this something\nthat any of us should care about or\ntrain for or pay attention to or is this\njust kind of getting into the Arcane\nnumber one you can train your ability to\nsweat this is important for heat\nacclimation and why that matters when\nyou sweat that actually is not what\nregulates your temperature uh you what\nyou want to have happen is the fluid to\nhit your skin and that to be evaporated\nthat's the actual mechanism so in fact\nif you stop sweating and like you can\nguarantee within a short amount of time\nyou're going to be done moving oh very\ninteresting I hope people heard that and\nreally are are highlighting that in\ntheir mind that sweating is a process of\nbringing fluid from your body onto the\nsurface of your skin and then the heat\ndumping aspect of sweating is the\nevaporation of that off off your body\nwhich brings to mind all sorts of ideas\nabout how to dress during exercise Etc\nbut what you said is that if you are not\nsweating enough you are limiting your\noutput capacity so it's not just about\nhaving enough fluid to switch wet yeah\nit's also about being able to sweat and\nbeing uh\ndressed appropriately to allow that\nsweat to move to evaporate off your body\nyep and heat acclimation training is as\nsimple as it sounds so just practice it\nmore so if you're going into a process\nwhere you either need to be in a hot\nenvironment or you need to improve your\nsweat rate you just need to practice\nsweating and your body will get compared\nto that I practice the sauna practice a\nJacuzzi just get in those things and you\nwill improve your ability to do that now\nthere is a huge genetic component I have\none individual actually a UFC fighter\nI've been working with and I don't mind\nmentioning his name he'll give me full\npermission Scott Holtzman many many\nyears\num\nhe's actually fighting right now\nactually today he'll be going he is like\nhe he is like you described like buckets\nand buckets and buckets of fluids come\noff this guy when he's tying his shoes\nlike he just goes right like and we've\nwe've improved that I actually sweat too\nmuch we worked on that a lot early in\nhis career and we got some improvements\ndown to get him to hold on to the fluids\nbetter that being said I've worked at\nthe other individuals in his weight\ncategory and it's the opposite right so\nwe can have them literally do the exact\nsame training session together and Scott\nwill dump six pounds and other folks at\nhis size will dump two two and a half so\nthere's a genetic component that is just\nthere and you don't need to worry about\nit there\num so can you identify if you are\na heavy salt sweater or not well you\nhave a whole bunch of routes for this\nnumber one is you can use the old free\ncost free test of just looking at your\nclothing and if you're seeing that white\nresidue all over it so you've you've all\nhave the friend who probably wears that\nsame baseball hat that they've had for\neight years if it is covered in the\nwhite junk all over the place that's a\nsign of a higher salt sweater if the\nopposite happens and it's like you can\npull their clothing back and there's\njust nothing there they are maybe a\nlittle bit of a lower salt sweater you\ncan also\nuse any number of hydration tests I know\nthat there is some coming out in the\nmarket very very soon that can give you\ntheoretically real time\nmeasurements it's like a CGM would be\nalthough I haven't seen any data on if\nthose are accurate or not I haven't used\none yet but there are a number that are\nout super cheap you know 10 15 20 bucks\nall the way up to a couple hundred\ndollars you can buy these patches put\nthem on you and get a reasonably close\nestimate and again if those things are 5\nor 10 or 20 off I don't know I have to\nsee independent data come out first but\neven if they are you're not worried\nabout the specific milligrams right\nwhether you sweat out you know 1250\nmilligrams in a workout or if it's 1340\nit doesn't really matter you're trying\nto look for big big numbers right are\nyou losing 500 milligrams using three\nand a half grams while you're at so\nthose things will get you in a ballpark\nto do exactly what you decide am I high\nmedium or low and there's a lot of them\nthat I've used in the past so\nthat that's another way to go about it\nthen what you want to do is probably\nmatch your electrolyte intake to\nsomething close to what you sweat that's\nthe ideal scenario you can get a lot of\ninformation about hydration from blood\nyou can look at like acute markers of\ndehydration like hemoglobin hematocrit\nif you're like if your hemoglobin is\nlike 15 plus\nit's funny we've talked about this in a\nfew episodes before but I see that and\nI'm like man that dude's super fit\nthat's like a 15 uh for him would be\npretty high 14 or so would be pretty\ngood for a female that's also the exact\nsame thing as a sign of acute\ndehydration\num so hematocrite same thing if you're\nnorth of 50 you're probably dehydrated\nso you can get a lot there are also\nthough a lot of biomarkers that can tell\nyou more about chronic dehydration so\nyou can run through those things as well\nso good blood chemistry test can tell\nyou a lot and you can actually get some\ninsights in your sodium and potassium\nalbumin is another fantastic way to\nmeasure longer term uh hydration status\nnow one of these amazing globulins that\nwe've sort of talked a lot about\nso you can do all those things you can\nalso simply measure the body weight pre\nand post and use a sweat patch or not\nand use the the Freer version of your\nclothing test and get a rough idea of\nwhere you're getting it from so\nthose are good places to start\nI want to go back though and make sure I\nwasn't over terrifying the audience too\nmuch on a server piece if you're\nperforming a type of training or\nexercise or sport in which you're not\nlosing more than two percent of your\nbody weight you don't need to be overly\nconcerned about hydrating in the sport\nand so we can actually get into\nsome equations for how much water to\ndrink during training right now but if\nyou if you're again losing less than\nthat it's not critical you can have some\nfluids it like makes you feel better but\nyou're not going to be experiencing\ntremendous amounts of performance\nsacraments if you're you know again out\nplaying a baseball game and is 50\ndegrees out you're fine um you can drink\nsome water but that's not going to be\ncompromising performance or recovery so\nwe can actually then if you'd like I can\ngo through the three-step system for\noptimizing hydration but those are I\nwant to make sure I planted that flag so\npeople aren't just terrified that they\ngot to be guzzling down water if they're\nyou know going to their physical\ntherapist for some stretching that's\nprobably not super important I'd like to\ntake a brief break and acknowledge our\nsponsor at athletic greens athletic\ngreens is a vitamin mineral probiotic\nand adaptogen drink designed to help you\nmeet all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic greens daily since 2012. so I'm\ndelighted that they're a sponsor of this\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once or twice a day\nis that it helps me meet all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs that is\nit covers my vitamins my minerals and\nthe probiotics are especially important\nto me athletic greens also contains\nadaptogens which are critical for\nrecovering from stress from exercise\nfrom work or just general life if you'd\nlike to try athletic greens you can go\nto athleticgreens.com huberman to claim\na special offer they'll give you five\nfree travel packs and they'll give you a\nyear's supply of vitamin d3k2 again if\nyou'd like to try athletic greens go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman to claim the\nspecial offer I would love for you to\ntell us what I refer to as the Galpin\nequation understanding of course that\nyou did not name it the Galpin equation\nlisten folks scientists can have things\nnamed after them but in general it's not\nreflective of healthy psychology if they\nname things after themselves correct\nsometimes yes neuroanatomists used to do\nthat but in any case Dr Andy Galpin did\nnot name the Galpin equation after\nhimself I named it after him and the\nGalpin equation for how much fluid to\ningest during exercise is\nyou want to take your body weight in\npounds and divide that by 30 and you\nwant to consume that number which would\nbe in ounces about every 15 to 20\nminutes so in the example of you being\n200 pounds you would take 200 divided by\n30 which is let's just call that number\nseven to be close which means you would\nconsume about seven ounces of water\nevery 15 or 20 minutes or so okay now as\na little bit of a point while I also did\nnot name it I also didn't do the\nresearch it's important to point out\nthat other scientists figured these\nthings out I just read their papers and\nmade that derivation of their equation\nto make it a little bit easier for us\nfolks who do not work on the metric\nsystem okay a couple of things first of\nall I'm not 200 pounds but it doesn't\nmatter how much I weigh because the\npoint is that the listener\ncorrect should take their body weight in\npounds divided by 30 in just that number\nof ounces in fluid every 15 minutes and\nthen for those out there outside the US\nthat are accustomed to thinking in\nmilliliters and liters not ounces and\nkilograms not pounds\nwhat is the Galpin equation in the\nmetric system this would be two\nmilliliters per kilogram\nwhich again if you were let's say 200\npounds that's going to be something\nroughly like we'll call it 90 kilos\nand so if you did two milliliters per\nkilo you'd be something like 180\nmilliliters of fluid again every 15 or\n20 minutes\ngreat and how should people ingest that\nfluid and of course I would imagine it's\nthrough their mouth um I would hope I\nhope there are other orifices that it\nmight suffice but let's not go there\nthey're drinking that water consistently\nor is it every 15 minutes they Slug it\nback does it matter okay yeah that's\nvery good a handful of things\nin general when you talk hydration the\nslower and steady you can go the better\nin fact the reason these this two\nmilliliters per kilogram number came out\nis because a number of Trials were run\nwhen they looked at that every 15\nminutes just one bolus of it you know\num in different derivations and it's\npretty clear that the slower Pace one\ncould do it the better so whether you're\ndoing it every 10 minutes or 15 or 20\nminutes the reason we actually give that\nGap is because you have to be also\noffset a little bit of GI distress in\nfact like kind of the the four golden\nrules of recovery if you will\num we use sort of three R's you need to\nrebuild rehydrate and replenish what\nthat really means is you need to have a\ncontinuous glucose stream\nyou need to have a continuous amino acid\nstream you need to hydrate and you need\nto do all one two and three without\ndisturbing your gut too much\nand so in this particular case\nit was sort of found that we can hit\nthat level in general\nand be just fine for most people so I\nmean a little bit of context the example\nwe gave there in both cases it's\nsomething like six to seven ounces for\n15 or 20 minutes if you think about that\nthere's 16 ounces in a pound\nand most water bottles like if you go\nbuy a water bottle in a store here it's\nthey generally come in like 16 ounce\nbottles ish so six or seven ounces is\nreally like a third\nof a water bottle Maybe\nevery 15 or 20 or so minutes so it's not\nsome egregious amount of water that you\nhave to slam down now that is influenced\nheavily by how hydrated you started the\nsession with so how high are you came in\nexternal factors like heat humidity\ntemperature things like that but that\ngives you a rough idea that again and\nthese are numbers that you would need to\nconsume to optimize performance\nat the end of that then is when you\nwould look to see how much I lost like\nwe talked about earlier\nand then add back that 125 percent\ntaking into account how much fluid you\ningested so if you're 200 pounds and you\ndrink a total of say a pound of water\nduring the training and you started off\nat 200 and you finished at 198.\nyou actually lost three pounds\nnot two pounds because you lost three\nyou drank one during it so your final\nnet number is two so now you don't you\nreally need to drink back 125 of that\nremaining two pounds\ntwo and a half pounds something like\nthat these numbers especially that 125\nare they're just rough guidelines some\nactually papers suggest it's all the way\nup to 150 percent\nso it's just like an idea don't measure\nout whether you need 5.5 ounces or 6.2\nounces like it just sort of gives you an\nidea of where to start all right a few\nsips every 15 or 20 minutes is close\nenough\nI've actually started using uh the\nGalpin equation to determine how much\nfluid I need for mental work given the\nnow robust data that are out there on\nthe relationship between hydration and\nmental work it's\num been very effective for me and again\nthere are peer-reviewed studies that\nthat support the idea that hydration is\nimportant for proper mental Clarity and\nenergy and focus and that even being\nslightly dehydrated can disrupt that but\nif one is drinking so much water that\nthey're frequently going to the restroom\nand can't comfortably uh focus on the\nwork they're doing that's also an issue\nso\num that's very helpful what are the\nthree most critical features of\nhydration and then I'd like to move on\nto\num some of the more particulars about\nsupplementation and nutrition three\nparts start hydrated\nmaintain hydration throughout\npart three is hydrate post to fix it\nokay we gave you the half ounce per\npound of body weight equation so you\nstart the training hydrated we gave you\nthe\nyou know two milliliters per kilogram\nslash body weight divided by 30.\nto stay hydrated let me give you the 125\nbut I can actually just give you sort of\nI'm giving you another list here I'm\nsorry but it is my five-step cheater\nguide\nfor optimizing hydration for performance\nall right step number one drink a lot of\nwater first thing in the morning this\ngets everything kickstarted get you\ngoing it also saves you from having to\ndrink a bunch of water at night which is\nthen going to compromise your sleep\nwhat's a lot depending on how big you\nare the general thing I'll tell people\nis like one of the very first things you\nshould do throughout your day you wake\nup\ngo to the bathroom as you're consuming\nyour sunlight consume water this is\nmaybe chugging a full glass that's\nhonestly what I do it's not the best\nroute but I'll just get 16 ounces 16\nounces or so is great it's fine if\nyou're larger\num you know I'm 165 to 70 pounds\ndepending on what's going on maybe a\nlittle higher sometimes if you're 225\npounds maybe that number is 30 ounces\nokay so you just sort of scale up and\ndown and the only reason I say a lot is\nit just depends on what you're doing and\nI also should clarify I don't really\nliterally mean chug just like sips\nbecause the faster you drink water the\nfaster it's going to expand blood volume\nthe faster it stands blood volume the\nfaster you get rid of it\num I don't think a lot of people will\nknow that yeah this is maybe this is\nclarifying this is also we sort of\ntalked about earlier if you drink too\nmuch water you'll dilute the system well\nif you have a diluted system your body's\nfirst reaction is to rid of water to\nbring total blood volume down right\nremember if you were to go to a doctor\nand they look at your total blood volume\nthey're like man you're five and a half\nliters you're gonna be like holy crap\nyou're going to be put on a diuretic\nbecause you don't want to have a heart\nattack blood pressure I wonder if people\nare drinking a 16 ounce glass of water\nor other fluid all at once before going\nto sleep and that's why they're waking\nup in the middle of the night totally\ngiven what you just said probably a\nbetter\num protocol would be to sip on a glass\nof water in the final hour two hours\nbefore sleep generally the number we say\nis three hours in the three hours\nproceeding sleep you want to basically\nlimit fluid intake to sipping as needed\nI think that's I'm going to start that\ntonight because I wake up generally once\nper night to use the bathroom and I do\ndrink some fluids before I go to sleep\nmostly because I'm pretty thirsty at\nthat time yeah\num but I'm gonna start sipping that\nwater in the uh three hours heading into\nsleep yeah so you can actually pay\nattention to his um\nto go back this is actually I love doing\nthis stuff but if you're waking up at\nnight and you have a very dry mouth\nnot for me all right because it can be\none of two things you might actually be\ndehydrated and so then what the mistake\npeople make is like man my mouth is so\ndry I keep getting up to drink water at\nnight that makes you then pee too much\nwhat that also indicates is probably\nyour mouth breathing so a lot of ways to\nfix people waking up and urinating too\nmuch at night is to tape your mouth and\nor use a dilator over your nose and then\nwhat happens is you don't feel like you\nhave a dry mouth so you don't get up to\nconsume any extra water throughout the\nnight so that actually reduces your your\nfluid intake so you don't have the\nproblem of actually now having too much\nfluid to do it and so it's another\nreasons why mouth taping can really\nreally help and\nif you are having those issues and or\nsnoring those are not benign that's a\nreally like you really should get some\nwork on those um something you're not\nsleeping very well is the way I'll say\nit it doesn't doesn't necessarily mean\nsomething life-threatening but it's not\na good thing so you're going to run kind\nof your triaging things back and forth\nso if you're like I'm waking up to pee a\nlot but my mouth isn't thirsty okay\ngreat then you may actually have just a\nwater consumption issue if it is my\nmouth is dry but I'm actually waking up\nand I'm having these large urinations\nthen you're not actually dehydrated\nyou're just breathing through your mouth\nif you're waking up and your mouth is\ndry\nand there's not a lot of pee there then\nyou actually might actually legitimately\nbe under hydrated so a little bit of a\ngame you can play there well that's\nsuper informative I think that\num the point alone that\ngulping a bunch of water all at once is\ngoing to cause you to need to excrete\nthat water\nsoon after\num is a really important point also for\npeople that are going to I don't know\ngive a talk or um you don't want to have\nto get up to use the restroom you have\nto sit through a long meeting yeah um\nclearly I'm violating all these rules up\nuntil right now I've been you know not I\nsort of followed the seagull approach to\nuh to consuming fluids just in\num enormous volumes I'm going to start\nsipping um fluids instead\num what are some of the other rules of\nhydration so you're going to wake up\nyou're going to start your day and start\nhydrated so you know you're consuming a\nlarger percentage of your water earlier\nin the day then you get all the\nperformance enhancing effects of water\nand you don't have to worry about it\ncompromising your sleep so that's step\nnumber one also now you're gonna start\nyour session closer to hydration all\nright great number two eat mostly real\nWhole Foods\nwhy\ninteresting what you may or not have\nthought about is a huge determinant of\nyour hydration status is your food\nchoices if you look at different foods\nfor example most fruit watermelon\nwatermelon is like 95 plus percent water\nfantastic Source also by the way since\nwe're here it is not extremely high in\ncarbohydrate it's not extremely high in\nsugar it is by percentage but since it\nis almost exclusively water you're\neating it is not something that is\nextremely dangerous in terms of sugar I\nthere alone probably all the things\nwe've talked about in the six six\nepisodes uh that comment right there\nwill probably blow the internet to\npieces and I'll probably get hate mail\nfor life for it but from people\nwater throwing watermelons yeah yeah oh\nmy gosh well I don't think the point is\nthat sugar is necessarily bad I think\nthe point is that for most people\nthey're ingesting too much sugar most\npeople yeah um and it's interesting\noftentimes the people who are justifying\nthe ingestion of sugar are exactly the\nkind of people that should not ingest so\nmuch sugar so there's a little bit of a\nwell a user bias the point here is if\nyou're eating whole real food this is\nlike now we're kind of splitting hairs\nabout those things so\nso morning hydration\nyeah now important Point here\nif you compare it to other Foods\num like actually meat is is a very high\npercentage of fluid depending on how\nwell or long you've cooked it you just\nremember you said earlier over 70 water\nright so if you're eating meat you're\ngetting actually a big chunk of water as\nyou cook it of course you lose some of\nthat but meat can be like I wouldn't\ncall it a hydrating food item but it is\nnot as low as something like a biscuit\nwhich can be actually like 10 water\nthat's why it's like dry and dense which\ndoesn't mean it's bad for you but there\nif you're eating highly processed foods\nalmost by association that means they've\nbeen dehydrated\nor portionably right so you're just\ngetting less total fluid intake in\naddition they have also been highly\nsalted\nin general right so now we're in this\nposition where we're under hydrated and\nhighly salted bad spot if you now switch\nover to mostly again just mostly whole\nreal food-ish whatever that means to you\nthen your hydration is going to\nSkyrocket you're going to have a lot so\nyou're eating a ton of food in fact it\nshould be a large percentage of the\nfluid intake you have actually should be\ncoming from your food you shouldn't have\nto be smashing water bottles after a\nwater bottle all day in that case though\nyou do need to add salt back so we do\nsee this a lot with people who try to\nmake a transition from maybe a\nsub-optimal Nutritional Lifestyle and\nthey give up a little bit of other\nprocessed food and they come over and\nthey start having problems because\nthey're not actually consuming enough\nsalt\nso add that back easy way to do that you\ncan use electrolytes and we could talk\nabout those numbers if you want if you\njust salt your food that you're making\nyou know to taste that's going to get\nmost people in a pretty good spot so\nstart hydrated\nconsume hydrating Foods\nstep number two step number three\nyou want to pre-hydrate if you know\nyou're going to do a workout session\nand it's going to be hot and long or one\nof those things you want to look for\nthat half a pound a per body weight of\nounces so that's the number we're\nlooking for to start our hydration\nsession we do that we're pretty much\ntaken care of and then like I said\nadjust depending on lifestyle humidity\nand other factors like that you can use\nwhat is called the what\nsystem w-u-t I think Bob kennethick has\ndone a ton of research in this area if\nyou want to read more look up his\nresearch it is simply weight\nurine and thirst so in other words check\nyour body weight\nlook at your urine color and engage your\nthirst and actually you can use through\nthose three things and those can\nsignificantly predict actual hydration\nstatus independent of actually measuring\nosmolality or anything like that so\nthose three metrics alone are pretty\ngood indicator\nof where you're at so you're going to\nhave that normal amount of water plus or\nminus\nif you miss that number for whatever\nreason you get distracted the number we\ntypically tell people is like something\nlike 400 to 500 milliliters of water in\nthe hour proceeding the training all\nright so that's like 13 to 20 ounces\nso like you know you're gonna go work\nout at three o'clock it's two o'clock\nand you realize oh man I have not\ndrinking much water today\nyou don't need to go smash tons and tons\nand tons just look for something like\nthat you know call it a bottle of water\nif you will if that's not enough if\nyou're in a really tough spot you can do\nmore like uh five to eight ounces\n15 or 20 minutes before exercise\nyou want to be really careful about\ndrinking a bunch of water like in the\nseconds before exercise\nbecause you're just going to feel a\nwhole bunch of water bouncing up and\ndown in your stomach and nobody likes\nthat so one to three hundred milliliters\n15 or so 20 minutes before that assumes\nyou're in this like\n185 pound range ish again if you're\ntalking people of much larger size you\nmay need to increase those values\naccordingly if you do all that\nthen you use the Galpin equation for\nyour intra workout hydration and you're\nin a pretty good spot\nwhat you want to consume in that is what\nI call Sweat\nwhat I mean by that is you don't\nactually want to necessarily consume\nwater only during a workout you want to\nconsume something that is ISO osmotic to\nyour blood\nso something that is the same\nconcentration\nthat you lost in your sweat so if you've\ndone a sweat test you would then drink a\nfluid that is of the same osmolality the\nshort version of that\nsomething in the neighborhood of 200 to\n400 milligrams of sodium most\nelectrolytes products are going to be\nsomething like that now I know element\nis is a thousand milligrams and it's a\nlot higher but most products now that\nyou're going to find are 250 to 400\nmilligrams and they're typically in the\nlike two\nto maybe up to three to one sodium to\npotassium range right coconut water is\nactually cool it's like basically the\nopposite like a cup of coconut water I\nthink has something like 200 milligrams\nof sodium but like 600 milligrams of\npotassium so um like total spoiler alert\nbut will we use coconut water a lot of\nhydration just add a little pinch of\nsalt because that'll bring the sodium\nway back up yeah one note about sodium\num obviously people who have\npre-hypertension or hypertension want to\nbe careful with their sodium intake\num anytime I've suggested that people\nmight consider ingesting more sodium you\nknow it's sort of uh it's like it's like\nputting a Target on your on your back\nand yet the data are pretty good showing\nthat if people are not getting enough\nsodium\ntheir mental Clarity their focus their\nmental stamina their physical stamina\nreally suffers\nand then people argue well most of us\nare getting too much salt that often is\ntrue for people that are eating a lot of\nprocessed foods and not training and not\ntraining but for many uh people who are\nalready sort of health conscious who are\ntraining they're largely consuming\nor I should say they're consuming\nlargely non-processed or minimally\nprocessed foods and especially for folks\nwho are not ingesting many carbohydrates\nand are consuming caffeine totally you\nknow a lot of people don't know that\ncarbohydrates hold water and that makes\nit sound bad it's not necessarily that\nyou know you're going to get\nsubcutaneous swelling of your body now\nit's recovery it's it's bringing water\ninto your system and it holds water so\nwhen you drop carbohydrate starches in\nparticular you urinate a lot more and\nwhen you drink caffeine you also urinate\na lot more as as you pointed out earlier\nso you start combining a few things like\nslightly lower carbohydrate or low\ncarbohydrate eating really quote unquote\nclean you're not getting a lot of salt\nin your food and drinking caffeine and\nthen exercising and then pretty soon\nthose numbers that come along with um\nyou know a gram of sodium in your\nelectrolyte drink are not all that\noutrageous and what you find is people\nfeel much much better when they're\ngetting enough sodium and of course I\nshould um say that there's no reason why\nsomeone has to ingest a supplement like\nelement or something there are plenty of\nother ways to bring sodium into your\nsystem you use a pinch of pink salt or\nHimalayan salt or sea salt or even just\ntable salt in water or just making sure\nthat you're salting your food enough and\nI think that there too salt appetite and\nsalt taste is a pretty good guide if you\ntaste something and it tastes really\nsalty to you that's an indication that\neither it's really salty or your salt\nstores are kind of tapped off you're\nokay whereas if you're craving salt and\nyou and you're thinking gosh I really\nwant to put salt on this already salty\nthing\nnot necessarily but oftentimes that\nmeans that you are salt efficient so\nsalt appetite is a pretty hardwired set\nof neural circuits and hormones and I\nthink we would all be wise to learn to\ntap into the our kind of intuition about\nsalt intake but of course also to\nmeasure your blood pressure Etc yeah of\ncourse if you think you have some sort\nof contraindication there that work with\nthe medical specialist without without\nquestion\num those situations you laid out though\nare very real a lot of people are living\nlike that and so it's important for\nthose folks to understand if you are\ngoing through symptoms fatigue\nlack of focus cognitive function\nperformance isn't there then hey like\nyou may be under salted and again\nactually a good amount of blood\nchemistry work can unravel that a lot\nand it can sort of tell you if you're\ngoing out of whack there are a number of\nfolks who are\nextremely sensitive to sodium in terms\nof health risk and that that is a real\nthing again work with your\num individual folks on that I don't work\nwith anyone for disease treatment or\nmanagement at all I've said that\nprobably four times I'll say it six more\ntimes\num I only take people who are healthy\nand try to make them perform at their\nbest possible level so it's actually\nfunny you mentioned that because I was\ngoing to give people my recommendation\nfor sodium intake in general throughout\nthe day and then I decided I'm not going\nto say that because all it's going to do\nis make all the rest of the people who\naren't coming to come after me for the\nwatermelon comment come after me for\nthat so by the end of today's episode\nthe goal is that there everyone's coming\nafter you but also everyone has learned\nsomething of value you've already given\nus a tremendous insights and actionable\ninformation on Creatine and hydration\nand\nalong those lines I'd love for you to\ntell us about some of the things that we\ncan do with supplementation in order to\nenhance training by taking certain\nthings before we train and I also have\nthe question of how\nlong before training should we start\nthinking about supplying nutrients and\nsupplements for the training session I'm\nnot sure I've actually finished my fiber\nmaybe I wasn't clear enough about the\nlast one so I just want to tie that that\nbow and then we'll go to the next one\nyeah no it was probably my fault so\nthat uh in addition to the\nGalloping equation in terms of amount uh\nI'm recording I recommended at you know\nroughly three to one sodium to potassium\nrecommendation and I gave you some rough\nnumbers for things like that I actually\nin all honesty use probably six to ten\ndifferent electrolyte companies\ndepending on the situation some of them\nare really good in the case again like\nelement that's nice about that is\nthere's no carbohydrate however the\ndownside is there's no carbohydrate so\nsometimes I want carbohydrates in the\ntraining because as you mentioned\nthere's significant evidence going back\nactually several decades on the benefit\nof carbohydrate during exercise so if\nyou're in a situation uh where you're\ntrying to again maximize actual exercise\nperformance you especially if it is\neither long duration so more than two\nhours\nor extremely high intensity and this has\nto be well north of 100 of your VO2 max\nin that situation as we talked about in\nthe endurance episode you can actually\nstart having a decrement performance\nbecause of a drop of muscle glycogen uh\nGlobal glycogen can start coming down if\nthat's the case augmenting with\ncarbohydrates during the training that\nis going to enhance performance it's\ngoing to do what we call spare the liver\nand it's going to keep my second rule of\nmy four which is maintain a glucose\ningestion it's going to keep that going\nin general what you're going to find is\nthe number is like a five to nine\npercent glucose concentration in your\nfluid which turns out to be like exactly\nthe number that most sports drinks have\nas well as I think that's pretty much\nexactly what a coconut water is the\ndownside of sports drinks since we're\nhere is they actually tend to be\nundersalted and so that they don't\nprovide enough of them if you look at\nthe numbers they're going to say\nsomething like 60 to 100 grams of\ncarbohydrate per hour\nis the Target and now if you're using\nthe sort of Galloping equation and\nyou're splitting that up into 15\nminute intervals it's something again\nlike 20 or so grams of carbs per 15 to\n20 minutes\nif you're doing again an hour long plus\ntraining though so admittedly 100 grams\nuh is a bit much for some folks\ndepending on your size so I would\nrecommend starting in that uh 60 gram or\nso range again per hour total is what\nyou want to get to and only in the\nsituation in which muscle glycogen\ndepletion is becoming a limiting factor\nto Performance so the other benefit of\nthat is as you mentioned that actually\ndrives water into the cell and so you're\ngoing to be in that nice sweet spot of\nyou're actually keeping glucose going\nwhich is going to enhance performance\nand you're helping hydration at the same\ntime so the other little part that's\nimportant to pay attention to here is\nthe type of carbohydrate matters so you\ncan use actually a whole combination of\nthings called resistant starches which I\nwill use for a long bouts of exercise\nbut in the middle of the workout you're\ngoing to want to focus on glucose and\nfructose mostly glucose typically at\nleast a two or three to one ratio of\nglucose to fructose and the reason is\nthose actually get into tissue through\nseparate Transporters and so what\nhappens is once the glucose Transporters\nget full you can't bring anything else\nin however since fructose comes in a\nseparate route you can maximize total\ncarbohydrate intake by using two\ndifferent unique forms there's a lot of\nways you can do this but this is where\nthe momentous fuel product is is that\nspecifically has that exactly in it so\nit's fantastic you can use food no\nproblem you can use the combination of\nthings like honey and different easily\nabsorbable and usable and things that\nyou can actually like maybe put in a\ndrink to get away with so there's lots\nof routes for it but you want to look in\nthat that sort of combination of five to\nnine percent roughly glucose for there\nso you do need to train your gut so do\nnot do anything and there's a generally\nA good rule do not do anything in your\ncompetition\nthat you've never done in practice so\ntry these food items try these amounts\nthe carbohydrate numbers try the sodium\nnumbers try the total amount of water\nstart low\nyou can always increase what you don't\nwant to do is have to run out during the\nmiddle of your spin class and Sprint to\nthe bathroom and hope nobody's in your\nway which in the lab we've seen\nwe'll just say accidents like that occur\nmore than once so just be careful of\nyour stomach I'd like to take a brief\nbreak to acknowledge our sponsor inside\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term health and well-being can\nonly be analyzed from a quality blood\ntest one issue with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there however is that\nyou get information back about various\nlevels of lipids and hormones and\nmetabolic factors Etc but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information inside\ntracker makes knowing what to do with\nall that information exceedingly easy\nthey have a personalized platform that\nlets you see what your specific numbers\nare of course but then also what sorts\nof Behavioral do's and don'ts what sorts\nof nutritional changes what sorts of\nsupplementation would allow you to bring\nthose levels into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com\nand to get 20 off any of inside\ntracker's plans again that's inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off I\nrealize I jumped the gun a little bit\nasking about supplementation for before\nduring and after a workout\num because what I neglected to ask about\nwas training in the fasted State this is\nsomething that we talked about in an\nearlier episode but I think it's worth\nhighlighting now\num Sometimes the best way to supplement\nif you will a workout or pre-workout is\ningesting nothing I'm one of these\npeople I actually prefer to do my weight\ntraining somewhere between seven and\neight a.m each morning sometimes a\nlittle earlier sometimes a little bit\nlater\nI drink\nfluid water and I do ingest caffeine\nprior to those training days on days\nwhen I don't train I do as I often\nrecommend uh people do delay my caffeine\nintake 90 to 120 minutes after waking\nbut in any event\nit's water and caffeine yerba mate or\ncoffee or some sort of stimulant for\nweight training workouts\nand generally not for cardiovascular\ntraining workouts although sometimes yes\nso I'm training fasted that said I'm\ningesting carbohydrate the night before\nto make sure that my I have glycogen\nstores that are topped off and uh so\nit's fasted but with that caveat what\nare your thoughts on training fasted and\nwhat I just described is fasted\novernight but some people are training\nin the afternoon and they may opt to not\neat anything in the you know two to four\nhours prior to training or maybe even\nlonger I personally find that caffeine\nhits my system a lot better when I'm\nfasted better meaning it just seems to\nhave more of a potent effect there are\nsome reasons for that\num and of course we dissuade people from\ningesting caffeine too late in the day\nbecause it'll disrupt sleep so I'm not\nsaying fast for three hours then drink\ncaffeine but who knows maybe that's in\nyour protocol the simple version of this\nquestion is what are your thoughts on\ntraining fasted and if people are going\nto train fasted how should they modulate\ntheir fluid intake if at all what\nhappens with exercise in the endurance\nand Metabolism episode we walk through\nand the fact that no matter what you're\nusing for fuel carbohydrates or fat or\neven other potential sources the end\nproduct of all of those is ATP CO2 and\nwater\nright so you're trying to make ATP that\nis the fuel for exercise now ATP is\nadenosine triphosphate so one two three\nphosphates on top of an adenosine well\nwhat you may have not put together\nis if you\nhydrolyze ATP and you break off one of\nthose phosphates you now have ADP if you\ndo it again you have amp addressing\nmonophosphide if you do it one more time\nnow you just have adenosine\nand if you have then therefore run\nthrough a lot of exercise\nburned a lot of energy you have\nincreased the amount of adenosine that's\nfloating around\nnow if you have a high concentration of\nadenosine what's that going to make you\nwant to do\nthat's going to bind to certain\nreceptors and we know when those\nreceptors get bound to you fall asleep\nbingo caffeine\nwill competitively bind to those\nreceptors therefore that's why caffeine\nstops you\nfrom feeling like you want to go to\nsleep right so we have a very clear\nrelationship between exercise fuel in\nfact if you look at the literature\nthere's a pretty clear relationship\nbetween the more caloric expenditure in\ndifferent sports and the higher amount\nof hours needed for sleep so there's a\nnice tie between how hard you're\nexercising how much energy you're\nburning how much you need to sleep\nstimulants which brings us all the way\nback to your question of fueling\nso do I need a fuel prior to my exercise\nabout if you're going to be limited in\nyour exercise bout buy fuel\nthen fueling is necessary one way or the\nother if it is a type of training that\nis not then it's not going to matter and\nso the examples we gave if you're doing\nif you're going to go do a 30-second\nbout of maximal exertion and you're\ngoing to do it one time\nyou don't need to worry about fueling at\nall we're eating within your workout\nbecause it's only 30 seconds yeah you\ngot 30 seconds you don't need to worry\nabout hydration post exercise you don't\nneed to worry about recovery total\nenergy expenditure was nothing if you're\ngoing to go\num you know you're going to go practice\nyou're going to go to the driving range\nand practice your golf swing you don't\nneed to worry about it the total amount\nof energy expenditure is just not high\nin fact in that case you might want to\nkeep it somewhat low because you want to\nkeep blood glucose fairly even and you\ndon't want to bring into the system you\ncertainly wouldn't want to use\nstimulants right because you may get\nover exerted inside\nin all of these things we probably\nshould have started off our conversation\nwith this\nin terms of macronutrients\nthe total amount throughout the day\nis more important generally\nthan the timing of them which is why you\ncan do things like have a bunch of\ncarbohydrate at night not eat the next\nmorning and lift and be just fine it\ndoesn't matter that you didn't have them\nin a few hours before your muscle\nglycogen is topped off your liver is\nglycogen is topped off you're absolutely\nfine you have plenty of fuel even if\nyou're to wait a few more hours in fact\neven if you were to do conditioning\nyou're probably fine I I have plenty of\nathletes that prefer to do many of their\ntraining sessions faster in the morning\nfor personal reasons not because it\nenhances performance but if it doesn't\nenhance or harm it then and it's a\npersonal preference thing fine\nif you're going to go do a session\nthough where you're going to be really\nconcerned with muscle glycogen depletion\nand again you can go back that episode\nto learn of different types when those\nthresholds hits and what you worry about\nthen a feeling would be important you\nwould either need to have something\nbefore the session or consume it during\nthe session so one of the other things\nwe'd like to say here is recovery\nstarts\nduring the previous workout\nright so if you're working out right now\nand you optimize nutrition right now\neven if you don't necessarily need it\nfor the current workout if you can get\nahead on recovery then you're going to\nbe fine the next day and the\ndifferentiation here between\ncarbohydrate and protein is important so\nthe total amount of protein you ingest\nthroughout the day is probably a bigger\ndeterminant for things like muscle\ngrowth than the timing so the post\nexercise anabolic window it doesn't\nnecessarily matter carbohydrate is\ndifferent the timing of that does matter\nit needs to be around and available\nyou can maximize both hydration\nand muscle glycogen resynthesis which is\nrestoring the muscle glycogen you burn\nduring exercise I also work with\nathletes that train multiple times a day\nso in those particular cases\na recovery window is half what you\nnormally have so if you're in a\nsituation where you have two or three\ndays before you work out again you don't\nneed to worry about getting carbohydrate\nin before during or after Because by the\ntime you go to train again you will have\nrestored your muscle glycogen levels\neasily however if you're training every\nday or twice in a day then the timing of\ncarbohydrate really starts to matter in\nthat case I see no reason to not ingest\nthose nutrients either before during or\nafter you don't need to necessarily do\nit but you can\nthe general rule of thumb I give is\nsomething like this\nif you're doing something where you're\ntrying to really work hard whether this\nis hypertrophy training or a lot of\nendurance energy expenditure is going to\nbe high potential muscle damage is high\nand or energy\nutilization is high\nwhat you want to look for is a number\nsomething in the area of like half a\ngram of carbohydrate\nper pound of body weight\nso you weigh 200 pounds you want to make\nsure that either pre-mid or post or\ntotal\nyou bring in 100 grams of carbohydrate\nit's just a very rough number to start\nprotein is about half of that\nso it's about a quarter of your body\nweight\nright so those numbers would be if\nyou're 200 pounds make sure you have 100\ngrams of carbs and 50 grams of protein\nand again it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe before or during or after\nand you'll be in a good spot all you\nneed to do then\nis Alter what I do I should say is Alter\nthe amount of carbohydrate\nbased on energy expenditure\nso a lower energy and easier workout\ninstead of having 100 grams of carbs I\nmight tack that down to 75 or even 50\nand be it a one to one carb protein\nratio if it was even harder more sun\nhotter outside more fluid loss I might\ngo from 100 grams of carbs up to 150 or\n200 and get closer to like a three to\none or four to one carbohydrate to\nprotein ratio so those are the numbers\nthat I generally go by well as I take a\nsip of My Double Espresso Americano here\nI'd love for you to tell us about\nstimulants sure there's no shortage of\nthese in most of our lives and of course\nyou can cover the health benefits of it\nlater you maybe you have an episode yes\nwe have an episode on caffeine and it\ndoes have certain health benefits\nalthough one has to use caffeine\ncorrectly in order to drive those yeah\nso there's caffeine is the easy one to\nstart with and we won't belabor the\npoint here uh the evidence is strong it\nhas a negrogenic effect you can take it\nat whatever dosage is reasonable for you\nand of course there is a bit of a\nlearning curve there such that obviously\nthe more you take it the more you need\nto take even though there's actually\nsome recent evidence showing even folks\nwho are acclimated to it will still see\nan ergogenic benefit even though if they\ndon't feel a big boost of this so\ntypically that takes 30 to 45 minutes or\nso but it's highly dependent upon the\nperson so some people can smell coffee\nand immediately feel better and that's\nprobably working actually through a\ndifferent mechanism\nof anticipation but you can take it\nthere the half-life of it is you know\nfour to six hours or something like that\nit totally depends on the person so\ndon't let it ruin your sleep but if you\ntake it prior to Performance it has a\nnoticeable effect on particularly\nendurance maximum strength may be less\nwell quite clearly less so in fact the\ndata are mixed there on whether it\nactually does anything for Peak strength\nalthough I think most people would\nuh Rec would suggest that you know\nyou're going to take it prior to trying\nto truly lift as high as trying to you\nknow lift a one repetition Max or\nsimilar but most of the the documented\neffects are on the the endurance based\nactivities yes so my read of the\nliterature uh in terms of performance\nenhancing effects of caffeine are that\none to three milligrams I want to make\nsure that people hear the units\ncorrectly before people Blitz themselves\nout with that caffeine one to three\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nabout 30 minutes prior to exercise\nhas a definite performance enhancing\neffect it also has a definite mental\nperformance enhancing effect especially\nwhen people who are regular caffeine\nusers have abstained from caffeine for\nanywhere from 2 to 15 days and and\nthat's an extremely rare circumstance\nbut even if they have not it appears\nthat one to three milligrams per\nkilogram of body weight of caffeine\ntaken about again it's not super precise\nas far as I can see now about 30 minutes\nbefore the event starts\num\ncan really enhance reaction time and\npower output and as well as as you\nmentioned endurance when I was\nresearching the caffeine episode one\ninteresting caveat that\num I discovered was that if people are\nnot caffeine adapted they are not\nregular users of caffeine the sudden\nintroduction of caffeine\ncan really degrade performance mostly\nbecause people don't know how to operate\nat that high level of autonomic arousal\nhave you ever observed that yeah 100 in\nfact there's actually data going up as\nhigh as 10 milligrams per kilogram of\nbody weight wow which is in fact once\nyou cross the five milligram per\nkilogram threshold you will start seeing\nperformance decrements so there's\nabsolutely such a thing of ruining your\nperformance with too much caffeine so\nmost people listening to this if you're\nthinking wow they said caffeine I'm all\nin and then you just stop listening and\nnow you you know go for your quad\nespresso shot before your every time you\ngo to work out you probably are passing\nthat threshold if you think about those\nnumbers one to three milligrams per\nkilogram body weight if you weigh 100\nkilograms that's 220 pounds that'd be\nsomething like two to five hundred\nmilligrams of caffeine which is like a\npretty high amount but you know a coffee\nis going to get you close and espresso\nis going to get you somewhat in that\nballpark depending on source and stuff\num so you don't really need to go and\nblister your brain with caffeine in fact\nif you do is it's quite common and in\nfact likely that you'll actually make\nperformance worse right yeah the amount\nof caffeine in different\ncoffees and sodas Etc of course varies\none thing that people ought to know is\nthat the smallest of commercially\navailable\num coffees at the most popular\ncommercial vendor so\num\ngenerally contain anywhere from 250 to\n350 milligrams of caffeine what that\nmeans is that the so-called medium and\nthe large contain as much as 500\nmilligrams or one gram of caffeine so\nfor you morning large coffee at a\ncommercial vendor\ndrinkers if you're wondering why you get\na headache if you're 30 minutes late on\nthat caffeine or\num if you can't access that caffeine at\nall or even if you're drinking coffee\nexcuse me from another source you're\nfinding like oh it's really not doing it\nfor me it's because the amount of\ncaffeine in the now commercially sold uh\ncoffees is exceedingly high it's about\ntwo or three times higher than the\nstandard lookup tables that you'll see\non the internet so I'm not saying that\nto demonize caffeine we can pretty\nquickly adapt to and form a tolerance to\ncaffeine some people never really can\nget over the Jitters other people\num are just fine with even a thousand\nmilligrams of caffeine but only because\nthey've been drinking a lot of caffeine\nconsistently anyway it's also wildly\ninconsistent from location to location\nuh The Brew type the functionality so\nyeah that stuff can be very hard to\nfigure out what's happening there's only\none way really to uh objectively measure\ncaffeine and that's use caffeine tablets\nand they work pretty well actually uh\nsomeone I know who's prominent in the\npodcast space uses 100 to 200 milligrams\nof caffeine in tablet form combined with\ntea so they've now conditioned\nthemselves to think that herbal tea\nactually has this caffeinating effect\nbut um tablet form caffeine while I'm\nnot recommending it to to outright it is\ngoing to give you the best sense of how\nmuch caffeine you can tolerate and how\nmuch is performance enhancing or is\nperformance degrading there's actually\nanother line of supplementation we can\ngo down here which is not technically a\nstimulant but it's something I use to\nhelp performance\nwhen you don't want caffeine and so this\nthing specifically if you're one of\nthose folks who have to exercise at\nnight\nand you want a little bit of boost for\nyour training but you don't want to have\ncaffeine because it messes up your sleep\nand this is when you can turn to the\nwhole like citrulline Arginine nitric\noxide sort of route and we'll skip the\nexplanation there but effectively what\nhappens is nitric oxide is this\nwonderful compound that causes\nvasodilation and of course that's going\nto Aid then in transporting nutrients in\nand out of the cell so it has an\nergogenic effect the you have a number\nof ways you can go about this some of\nthem have\nmore pros and cons than others and and\nthere are more and more data coming out\nspecifically on citrulline more recently\nif you look though in my opinion the\nmost consistent evidence for the most\nconsistent effect is in the supplement\nof beetroot or beetroot juice or extract\nor something like that so you can find\nthose supplements and they tend to again\nthey're pretty effective and enhancing\nperforms specifically anything moderate\nto longer duration endurance performance\nand they are not a stimulant so they\nwon't ruin your sleep that much you know\none note of caution for those of you\nthat are interested in citrulline or\nbeetroot because they are in the\nArginine pathway if you're somebody who\nhas a predisposition to cold sores\num oral cold sores that is or other\nforms of cold sores that\num because activation of the Arginine\npathway can exacerbate some of the\nneural related aspects of cold sores and\nthat's because the viruses that cause\nthose cold sores actually live on\nneurons then you want to be very\ncautious with citrulline especially high\ndose citrulline I can really amplify\nthat the cold sore response what about\nnon-stimulant yet\num\nFocus enhancing supplements things like\nAlpha GPC for example I routinely use\n300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC prior\nto hard physical training typically\nweight training but occasionally I'll\ntake 300 milligrams of alpha GPC prior\nto a mental work bout less often these\ndays because I kind of reserve it for\nphysical training and I don't tend to\nuse it every day maybe once every you\nknow third or fourth workout combined\nwith caffeine so that combination is\npretty uh pretty potent I find and so\ntechnically because it's a cholinergic\nAgonist it's not a stimulant in the\ntraditional sense but it has a focusing\nand an alertness promoting aspect to it\nwhat are your thoughts on those sorts of\ncompounds there's not much human perform\nexercise performance data on those there\nare certainly cognitive\nfunctioning tests on those so you're not\ngoing to find a lot of information no\nthough there isn't none we actually will\nuse many of these substances you could\nglobally call them nootropics which is\nyou know any\nsubstance that specifically only has\nbrain function is a rough way to think\nabout it we'll use them prior to\nmore challenging bouts of training this\nis something that we'll pull out say on\nsparring day only\nor the most important training session\nor a session when you're trying to work\non Pitch command or when you're trying\nto enhance work on your shot and as a\nbasketball player or you're really\ntrying to improve a certain swing as a\ngolfer or something like that but we do\nnot use them every day we do not use\nthem with every person so yeah we will\nuse those they are not stimulants but\nthey can be performance enhancing and\nanother kind of way to think about this\nis if you're in the case of\ncaloric restriction so whether you're\ntrying to lose weight or we're actually\ntrying to control weight for you know\nweight purposes in terms of a sports\nwhere you have to be in a certain weight\nclass or something like that\nwell we may not be able to give you food\nin fact we may not be able to give you\nstimulants because of the sleep thing or\nbecause we're already like maxed on a\nsibilance\nnow we can go this route and so at least\nlike mentally you're a little bit there\nand you're more likely to be alert and\nfocused and you can train harder despite\nthe fact that we didn't actually change\nfuel now that's a little bit of a short\ngame in terms of that's not your\npermanent solution you eventually need\nto bring calories up or you know\nwhatever other trains you're training or\nwhatever we're going to do but it can\nwork in a nice short pinch I'm very\ninterested to learn from you about\nfatigue reducers and I'm hoping that\nrhodiola rosea will come up in the\nconversation yeah great let's just start\nright there then there's actually a lot\nof research on this despite most people\nnot having heard of it I think I\nmentioned in a previous episode I've\nused it a lot over many many years\nyou have to be a little bit careful of\nit there's well first of all no we only\nwe should have said this at the onset no\nsupplement is the Panacea right\nnothing's going to work for everything\nin Rodeo is no no different it can have\na number of effects if you look across\nthe literature you're going to find\ngenerally somewhere between a small\nbenefit to little benefit it but not\noften is it detrimental with a few\nexceptions I know of a handful of papers\nthat would be two specifically where it\nmay actually reduce muscular endurance\nokay fine if you think about what's\nhappening is one of the benefits that\nhas been seen so far with Rhodiola\nis it is helpful at managing cortisol\nbut cortisol suppression is not a\nnecessarily a good thing we talked about\nhow if you do an acute out of stress\ncortisol will go way up and that is a\nsign of acute stress however a sign of\nlong-term excessive stress is cortisol\nsuppression and so this is a thing to be\nreally careful of is if you're feeling\ndown or lethargic or tired and you think\nyour adrenals are messed up and then you\nstart taking cortisol modulators you\ncould be making the problem worse\nbecause now your cortisol is actually\nsuppressed and now you're taking these\nthings to blunt it or keep it low and\nthen you continue to feel lethargic and\nlack of desire and libido and focus and\nsort of all these things so cortisol is\nnot a bad thing we want this to be going\nup and down\nuh\nany amounts that we want so if we're\nthinking about like for example waking\nup\num you would want generally something\nlike a 50 reduction in the first hour in\nterms of cortisol concentrations however\nif you're extremely suppressed already\num going down is is only going to be a\nproblem so rhodiola is is has a a good\nevidence base to support it for that um\nyou'll see actually a number of studies\nthat have looked at it in a whole host\nof areas for benefits so something good\nto do um the difficult part with\nrhodiola to be quite honest is getting\nit from a high quality brand and Source\nit's difficult to get as a single source\nwhich is a very very important thing to\ndo with supplements to try to get them\nsourced alone Rodeo that typically comes\nin combination with any other herbals or\nother stuff adrenal support etc etc and\nalso then getting them then third party\ncertified which for most folks is not\nnecessary but for any athletes that need\nto go through drug testing systems you\nshould not take any supplement at all\nthat does not have some sort of\nthird-party certification so those are\nthe challenges that being said if you've\never ran into somebody who's taking\nrhodiola and they're like I didn't do\nanything for me it it's possible that's\nyou know nothing works for everyone it\nalso could be just very poor quality\nsourcing so if you look at uh the there\nhave been a number of papers on\num its perception of fatigue and you've\nsort of mentioned that you felt pretty\nimmediate effects of taking it a few\ntimes yeah I'm fairly sensitive of\nsupplements but I've started taking uh\nrhodiola before\nworkouts and found that I could push\nmuch harder much longer through the\nworkout normally I would or typically\nbefore taking it\num that is in sessions where I did not\ntake it I would be able to work\nout very hard for 20 minutes or so the\nnext 10 minutes I could get some work\noutput and then the remaining uh period\nof time it was kind of a tapering off\nnow granted these are very intense\ntraining sessions these are not the\nendurance training sessions these are\nthe weight training sessions that one\none time per week per body part type\nsessions uh what I've noticed is I can\ncomplete the entire 60 minutes with with\nminimal fatigue now I mean obviously I\nhit fatigues within sets and of course\nyou know I get you remain human despite\ntaking it but um I found to be very\nuseful and I've been using it whenever I\nuse Alpha GPC prior to workouts yeah and\nI've been impressed by\nby it overall I do want to highlight\nsomething that you said because I think\nit's so so vitally important which is\nthat using single ingredient\nformulations for most things is critical\nto figuring out what works for you what\ndoesn't what dosages you need being able\nto take things uh two on one off\num two days on one day off for instance\nbeing able to increase dosage in the\nmorning and then maybe reduce the dosage\nand combine with something else in the\nafternoon\nsingle ingredient formulations are\npretty much the only way to do that\nthere's perhaps only one supplement that\nI take at all and that's athletic greens\nis there have been a regular podcast\nsponsor for a long time that is a\ncocktail of many many things and those\nare all adaptogens as well as some\nprobiotics and vitamins and things like\nthat so I'm not opposed to Blends where\nthe Blends include a lot of nutrients\nthat are synergistic but for all pill\ncapsule\nbased supplements where I'm looking for\na very targeted effect and it's not just\nabout foundational nutrition I\nreally believe strongly that single\ningredient formulations are the way that\nyou can build a rational approach to\nsupplementation and also make\nadjustments if something isn't making\nyou feel better and also make\nadjustments if something's really\nworking for you so for instance some\npeople might take Alpha GPC 300\nmilligrams and not feel anything go up\nto 600 milligrams not feel anything\nmaybe just feel kind of they don't like\nit other people like myself took 300\nmilligrams of alpha GPC the first time I\nwas like wow this really puts me in the\nzone\nbut I want to be really careful how\noften I use it I did mention I go up to\n600 milligrams occasionally but that\nreally puts me on the outer threshold of\nkind of overall levels of focus and\namped up such that if I drink too much\ncaffeine it can tilt me over the edge so\nI encourage people to become scientists\nof themselves and the only way to do\nthat is to try and limit the number of\nvariables and the final point is that I\nthink that single ingredient\nformulations are by far the best in\nterms of\nchanging things over time you know this\ncould be um uh women during their\nmenstrual cycle might find that during\ncertain phases of the cycle they're more\nsensitive to certain things than not\nothers and for men and women it may be\nthat you know certain times of year even\nand uh certain supplements might go\nbetter closer to sleep some earlier in\nthe day and on and on and on there's\njust no real way in my opinion to have a\nsupplementation protocol that involves\nlots and lots of Blends one or two\nBlends okay but lots of Blends I think\nthat's um I actually think that's the\npotentially dangerous territory yeah I\nmean just take rhodiola as a good\nexample I know a new meta-analysis came\nout just in the last few months looking\nat it and they found in general you see\nagain a slight to moderate Improvement\nand everything from Power output to\nfatigue resistant antioxidant effects to\nendurance performance so it's like okay\ngreat maybe there's a little bit here\nnow let's say you went to do it and the\nonly way you could access rhodiola is in\ncommon Nation with that and some lion's\nmane and you know some other of these\nadaptogens and was like well wait a\nminute I just wanted to take this to get\na better workout but now it also came\nwith the stimulant or this cortisol\nsuppressor or cortisol activator well\nnow also you can't take it at night or\nyou can't take it in the morning because\nyou're already you already had coffee\nyour options are just way limited so I\nthink the biggest part of all that is\nyou if something doesn't feel good you\nhave absolutely no idea you don't know\nif it was a rollio you don't know if it\nwas the boswellian it is in there you\ndon't know if it was any of the other\nthings that were smashed in there or it\ncould be something as simple as the\num the the citric acid they use like\nsome other combination of thing and now\nhere you are thinking that some\nsupplement that actually works for you\ndoesn't and you throw that out of your\nrepertoire for the rest of your life\nwhich is\nyou know not the biggest crime but it's\nnot needed and you're not really going\nto know so yeah I fully stamped you can\nlook back at my course lectures for the\nlast decade and you will see like\nstamped number one on the supplement the\nsections is make sure you're taking\nsingle ingredient supplements at all\ncosts\nthe last part about that too is you're\nmore likely\nto ensure the amount that is on the\nlabel is correct so if you're taking\nrhodiola and it says you know it's 100\nmilligrams in there and if that's only\nthing that's in there you're more likely\nthan not to actually get something close\nnow they're never perfect but it will be\nclose if it's in a combination of 20\nother things you actually don't have any\nidea if that's in there in fact there\nhave been many papers on melatonin\nand vitamin D\nand a number of other supplements in\nwhich when you actually just pull them\noff the shelf these are these are\nstandard studies where they would go and\nbuy us in like 20 to 25 different\nsupplements in the case of melatonin and\nwe'll actually measure the amount of\nmelatonin actually in them and despite\nthe fact that the label says five\nmilligrams they can be up to a 500 to a\nthousand fold actual concentration in\nthat supplement and then you wonder why\nsome people react great to melatonin and\nsome people that absolutely destroys you\nand this is also why like we'll actually\nwe'll see this constantly well people\nwill have like 500 times the upper limit\nof melatonin the morning after\nwhen the half-life is supposed to be\nmore like 90 minutes it should be\ntotally gone but we're seeing extremely\nhigh I'm not even talking like double\nI'm talking 10 20 30X the upper limit\nrange for melatonin the next morning and\nthen it's like well what are you taking\nhe's like oh I got this melatonin at X\nstore or X website and you're like holy\ncow\num so I'm not opposed to melatonin\ntheoretically\num but you have to be careful with that\none in particular so any supplement has\nthat to be true\nso you want to buy them from\nas many places as you can that are high\nquality and if they are third party\ntested even if you're not a performance\nathlete\nI want to stress this even if you're not\na performance athlete third party\ncertified and tested supplements are\nyou're less likely to just just get\nwildly high concentrations or low\nconcentrations of active ingredients and\nso relative to other ones who you might\nget for cheaper but you could be totally\nwrecking Yourself by getting you know 50\nmilligrams of melatonin every night and\nnot realizing it so then of course the\nnext morning you drown yourself in\ncaffeine and then you can see what death\ncycle you're in now yeah and people\ncould look for third party certification\non the packaging and um some websites\nwill allow you to zoom in on the bottle\nbeforehand it's largely listed on on\ncertain vendor websites a brief point\nabout supplement cost and blends and I\npromise this will be a brief point\ndifferent ingredients meaning different\ntypes of supplements have widely varying\ncosts in order to you know create to get\nthem to manufacture them so often does\nwhat you'll find is that blends will um\ninclude the least amount of the most\nexpensive\nuh ingredient right um not always the\ncase there are some there are certain\nexceptions to this and I mentioned some\nBlends that I like a few minutes ago\nthat are for foundational nutrition\nadaptogens and probiotics athletic\ngreens of course just being one of\nseveral examples out there but when it\ncomes to say a sleep Blend or a\npre-workout blend there are some decent\nproducts out there but a lot of them\ntend to put in more of the\nleast expensive ingredients and less of\nthe ones that you're actively seeking\nand so those tend to be caffeine tends\nto be a kind of a buffer against the\nother things meaning if you pre-workout\nthat putting caffeine in there isn't\nnecessarily a bad thing but if it has\nfive other things in there oftentimes\nwhat manufacturers will cheat on is the\nactual amount of the things that are\ncostly so again single ingredient\nformulations for eighty percent of your\nsupplements I think is really the way to\ngo and the other thing I know is going\nto come up as we're talking about all\nthese supplements is this issue of\ndependency I often get this question and\nwhen I solicit for questions uh on\nsocial media in anticipation of this\nepisode number of people said okay so if\nyou take a sleep formulation do I need\nto take it every night if I don't take\nit will I have an incredibly hard time\nsleeping if I take a pre-workout every\ntime I train will uh will I need it it's\na great question some people will take\nsupplement holidays as they may be\ncalled for a couple of days each week\nback back to back some people take them\nstraight through I myself take a sleep\ncocktail we've described this it's\nmagnesium theanine and things this is\nnot one ingredient these are multiple\ningredients in fact precisely because\nsome people who have sleep walking and\nVivid dream issues can't take theanine\nbefore bed in any case I've had times\nwhen I either forgot my supplements\nthat's rare or I just didn't have what I\nneeded or just simply took a break for a\nnight and it was not a problem\nbut in terms of pre-workout I do think\nthat people become dependent on being in\nthat really ramped up state but I don't\nthink we view all this as like true\ndependency kind of like addiction\ntotally right I mean I Define addiction\nas a progressive narrowing of the things\nthat bring you pleasure so you know I I\nsuppose people could get addicted to\npre-workout but it seems a little\nunlikely more likely there would be a\ndependency such that if you didn't have\nyour pre-workout you might feel like oh\nyou're not motivated to train so what\nare your thoughts on\num taking little holidays from\nsupplements and varying the frequency of\nsupplement and in particular as it\nrelates to stimulants and fatigue\nreducers the end goal\nanytime I coach somebody is to get them\ninto a physiological state in which they\nrequire\nno or close to no supplementation\nthat's the target we should\nreally be in a position to where our\nlifestyle our sunlight exposure our\nStress Management our physical activity\nour sleep and our hydration and our\nwhole food nutrition provide us almost\neverything we need now look again there\nare some foundational items that we can\ngive people we've put together a little\nbundle actually for this that the basic\nthings that you can go look at\nbut that's the goal right so the target\nis to be let your physiology run the guy\nyour physiology is way smarter than we\nare even if I take a bunch of biomarkers\nfrom you your physiology still knows\nbetter than those few markers can tell\nme so that's always where we're ending\nup I actually personally\ndon't like people being in a position\nthat they have to take a supplement for\nanything so I don't like it if you have\nto take a supplement to have a good\nnight of sleep I don't like it if you\nhave to have a supplement to train we\nwill use any of these stimulants very\nvery carefully\nwith any of the athletes we work with\nand certainly for the non-athletes\nbecause at least the athletes we have an\nend date we have a fight schedule we\nhave a season we have a game you're\ngoing to pitch whatever\nwhen you don't have that it's sort of\nlike you're in this endless cycle of oh\nyou're just going to do that all day\nevery day\num we don't really need to be in that\nspot\nso what I the way that I describe My\nPhilosophy is I will use those\nshort-term tactics\nto symptom manage if I have to so if\nsomebody comes to me and like you're\nfeeling awful and we've got to get\nthrough the hump okay great maybe we'll\ngive you something for Sleep immediately\nto get you sleeping that allows us to\nthen come back and work on the causal\nproblem right so this is what is why are\nyou having a hard time sleeping anyways\nif you have to take a nine cocktail\nsupplement to sleep then all we're doing\nis is blinding the reason why are you in\nthat position to begin with right so we\nsee this all the time whether it is\nsleep problems whether it's cortisol or\ntestosterone the question is well why is\nthat low now we may give you something\nagain to manage it immediately but the\ntask the the mystery I'm going to try to\nunveil is why why is it there to begin\nwith this could be something like this\nis natural for you and your lack of\nenergy is something else\nor it could be actually it is not a\nnatural level for you but something is\nsuppressing it any number of you've got\nsome infection going on there's some\nallergic reaction to something in your\nenvironment there's a you know mold\nMercury like that one comes up a lot\nyou'll see Mercury and folks and that's\ncausing a lot of problems um or any\nnumber of heavy metals or toxins any\nhost of things psychological distress\nbad daily habit you don't ever see the\nsun like you don't ever sweat you don't\never drink we was talking about so many\nthings so I'm always going to hunt\nfor that and I hate using this phrase\nit's highly maligned for a good reason\nbut root cause all right so we're trying\nto find that it's like are we making\nsure that we're not causing this problem\nand I'm not going to want to give you a\nsupplement\nto cover up something if we're not even\ntrying to solve the problem of what's\nbeing there that being said am I that\nconcerned about people taking a\nmultivitamin just all throughout no not\nreally am I concerned about people\ntaking creatine no like go ahead those\nones are generally pretty fine to to\njust take but anything else I want a\nreason\nI really don't like giving people\nanything in a super physiological\nconcentration or a superfood\nconcentration right so again an amount\nyou wouldn't find in a normal food\ndosage unless we have really a specific\nreason some of these things are more\nproblematic\nothers are less problematic so when an\nant to answer the question of dependency\nyou have a combination of actual\nphysiological dependency caffeine like\nthat actually creates a physiological\ndependency versus a emotional or\npsychological dependency or just a I\nlike drinking this like that's my habit\nthat's my routine there's a fancy\nscientific phrase for that but it\ndoesn't matter so yeah we want to get\noff that and like again my personal\nphilosophy is I don't want you dependent\nupon anything I want to create extremely\nresilient people and I want to create\nphysiological resilience we actually\nhave a fancy little algorithm we use to\nmeasure that in people and so we can\nactually calculate that number and the\ngoal of us is to push that number higher\nso that we don't have to have anything\nso many situations pop up in your real\nlife\nthat you're not going to have your\nsupplements or you're not going to have\nyour routine or you're not going to have\nyour journal or whatever\nbut also for the long term I don't want\nto create a situation in which this is a\nshort-term success that you have to now\ndo that the rest of your life\nno let's just get out of the way let's\nfix the problem if there is something\nsymptom management that's real\nwhile we're actually searching for a\nbetter foundational habits um the last\nthing I want to say about this is\nif you're only covering symptom\nyou're really missing signal right which\nis if you're constantly tired throughout\nthe day and all you're doing is giving\nyourself a number of Alpha gpcs and\ncaffeines Etc even though there's good\nliterature okay are you really just\nusing that to allow your poor sleep\nhygiene to happen if I took those away I\nbet you\nyou would actually start addressing your\nsleep if that's the Cause right all\nright you're stress or your poor\nhydration like you would go hunting for\nthe problem\nand so like you want to walk a fine line\nhere of going like Hey look is an\nathletic greens supplement that big a\ndeal no probably not but\nwait a minute am I actually now covering\nup the pain point\nthat is maybe needed it's a signal to\nactually get my ass in gear to go make\none of these changes\num whatever it needs to be so I know I\ngot like a little bit meta on you a\nlittle bit philosophical but that's\nhonestly how I approach it yeah I think\nit's really important a friend of mine\nwho's a physician has a great saying um\nwhich is Better Living Through Chemistry\nstill requires Better Living oh um\nthat's golden that's so good you know\nand it pertains also to things like\nantidepressants and ADHD drugs and\nthings of that sort most all of those\nthings were developed as tools to allow\npeople to move from a maladaptive State\nokay maladaptive it's hard to Define but\nthink about in any domain of life you\ncan either be back on your heels\nflat-footed or forward Center of mass\nand there are times when people are so\ncompromised neurochemically that they\nneed to use pharmacology in order to get\ninto a flat-footed position yeah you\nknow they're really back on their heels\nflat footed or forward Center or mass\nbut the idea was always that those\nthings were developed as things to allow\npeople to engage in the sorts of\nbehaviors that can produce the same\nsorts of neurochemical shifts and if\npeople are thinking well what sorts of\nbehaviors can induce these neurochemical\nshifts I'll just zoom out myself for a\nmoment here and say I am a big proponent\nI believe you are as well if I may\nin doing behavioral tools first whenever\npossible really establishing good habits\nthe do's and don'ts which we've talked a\nlot about in this series and in this\nepisode\nthen excellent nutrition which involves\ndo's and don'ts volume food Choice\ntiming all the factors and then also\nsupplementation\nand also they're sometimes a case for\nprescription drugs certainly and often\nbrain machine interface or body machine\ninterface measuring stuff using devices\nbut that the foundation of behaviors and\ngood nutrition are really truly\nfoundational and it's hard in anything\nto skip steps but supplements and\nprescription drugs are one place where\npeople often skip steps and then they\nthey don't actually learn how to\ncultivate the best behavioral practices\nincluding the don'ts as you mentioned\nand then just one more point along these\nlines\nyou know you talked about taking\nanything for energy is really uh\ndisruptive to the system and it is\nbecause especially caffeine while it has\nits uses and even health benefits it's\nreally borrowing it it's against the\nadenosine system with interest and so\nbecause caffeine acts as an adenosine\nantagonist effectively while caffeine is\npresent in those receptors you don't\nfeel as sleepy you have more energy your\nreaction time goes down memories enhance\nFocus performance of all kinds yes but\nthen when that caffeine is dislodged\nfrom the receptor then the adenosine can\nact even more potently at those\nreceptors so it's sort of like being\nable to borrow against the normal\nvariations in wakefulness and sleep and\nthis is why we encourage people if\nthey're not training first thing in the\nmorning to push their caffeine intake\nout about 90 to 120 minutes after waking\nso they can clear some of that adenosine\nin the morning which tends to happen\neven\nafter we wake up\num people can listen to episodes on\nMaster your sleep or perfect sleep for\nthe caffeine episode to understand more\nabout that but the the final thing I\njust want to say here and then it\nprompts a question is you know in\nthinking about\nsupplement protocols\nI think a lot of people assume that once\nthey start taking something they're\ngoing to have to take it all the time\nand one idea perhaps is that people have\nsome Alpha GPC around that they could\ntake and granted it'd be great if people\ncould try things without having to buy a\nwhole product I think companies\nhopefully are listening to this and\nwe'll give people a sample to see if\nsomething works for them and then give\nthem an opportunity to try it to have\nthings around but not necessarily assume\nyou're going to take it every time right\nsome things you take every day\nfoundational nutrition\nsupplements for instance but then also\nto take a look at how well you're eating\nor not eating right at times when I'm\neating much better I consuming you know\nlow sugar fermented foods which are\ngreat for the gut microbiome I consume\nless probiotics if ever I've been really\ncompromised for whatever reason then I\nwill take pill form probiotics but I\ndon't take those all the time because I\nget them from food and from certain you\nknow Green strings like athletic greens\nand so forth so I think that nutrition\nand supplement are tethered in this way\nin my mind and I don't think that most\npeople think of supplementation as\nsomething that where you can induce a\nlot of variability in when and how you\ntake them but as far as I'm concerned as\nlong as they're single ingredient\nformulations you can be\num you can use supplements once a week\nif you want you can use them seven days\na week you could use them twice a day\nfour times a day every day\nor you could use them not at all agreed\nyeah some of them will have an effect\nrandomly like that others will not and\nwe talked about creating being one of\nthem it's if you're going to take it\nonce or so a week then there's I mean\nbasically no benefit that's a very good\npoint creatine\num beta alanine\nis another fantastic example of\nsomething you need to take consistently\nif you want some sort of benefit\nit needs to be built up in muscle we\nneed to use that to create uh carnosine\nwhich is what's actually going to help\nus with our fatigue management that's\nwhy we call it like an acid buffer so in\nour previous metabolism episode we\ntalked about that being a major cause of\nfatigue the wonderful part the one of\nthe reasons why beta alanine works so\neffectively is it blocks that buildup so\nthat is an example of another one that\nyou would want to take other things like\nfish oil\nyou could certainly skip a day here and\nthere it wouldn't be that big a deal I\nalso do support your comment if you can\ntake absolutely none of these things and\nand be just fine\num in terms of and we'll come back maybe\nto Beta alanine in a second\nin terms of some other fun stuff my\ncolleague Greg osiki ran a really cool\nnumber of studies looking at how\nexercise actually Alters the microbiome\nthis is actually an area that we I\nprobably have 300 stool samples sitting\nin my freezer in my lab oh goodness\nanother reason to pause before entering\nyour lab yeah another reason to not\napply to come be one of my graduate\nstudents unless you want to deal with\nthat we actually have a number we've\napplied for a couple of Grants to look\nmore into this specifically with females\nso hopefully we can get that funded but\nnonetheless\nyou can actually see some a pretty\ntraumatic and I say that word on purpose\nchanges in the gut microbiome there's\none in particular study I was thinking\nof that Greg did is he looked at the the\nchanges pre-post and ultra marathon\nand even within a single bot of exercise\nI can't remember some of the markers but\nI know one of the markers was\nspecifically increased by like 14 000\npercent\nuh after a single bout of exercise now\nthis is an ultra marathon this is like\nlike totally absurd amount of exercise\nrelative to what normal people would do\nwould be but that number I remember like\nit was like fourteen thousand two\nhundred twenty nine percent or like\nsomething some random number like that\nof something meaningful yeah something\nmeaningful I can't remember which marker\nuh that was that had changed um I know\nstreptococcus was in there streptococcus\nwent up like maybe something more like\n30 or 40 or 50 so the point is\nwe haven't even had the proper time and\nwe don't to even launch into the\nmicrobiome supplementation there needs\nto be ultra specific you wouldn't be\nbest served to just jump in and take\nrandom things there\num that's it's a whole area of emerging\nscience we know very very very little\nabout it but there is a number of\nactionable things one could do there so\nprobably something to not mess with uh\nwould certainly work with a qualified\nphysician if you think you have\nsomething going on clinical or\nyou know some actual problem there don't\nwork with someone who's not a specialist\na medical doctor there but just randomly\nassigning a bunch of probiotics or\nprebiotics without intention is Maybe\nthe next Forefront of human performance\nresearch but we'll have to maybe come\nback in a few years and dive into that\nin detail or perhaps you can bring\nsomebody out as an expert in that to\ndiscuss that yeah gut microbiome is\nfascinating I think of sleep as the most\npowerful performance enhancing\nactivity uh of course you still have to\ndo the activity yeah I consider it\nfoundational like it basically raises\nthe tide on mental health physical\nhealth performance of all kinds\num there's recent data that during sleep\nyour body goes through all its various\nforms of metabolism possible yep which\nis amazing this was measured from breath\nin human subjects breath metabolites in\nhuman subjects so obviously uh if one is\nthinking about supplementation and\nwondering okay what's what's the best\nsupplement to enhance performance you\ngave some great rationale for why\ncreatine would be an excellent choice\nprovided to your eating well and\nhydrating well and then to my mind the\nnext thing on the list would be anything\nthat allows you to improve the\nquality and maybe even the duration of\nyour sleep although if you wake up and\nyou feel rested throughout the day and\nonly need a short nap in the afternoon\nnot everyone needs one but then\ngenerally that means you're feeling okay\npeople sometimes get flipped onto this\nidea that they have insomnia insomnia is\nexcessive daytime sleepiness where\nyou're falling asleep during the day\nthat's insomnia it could also be\nnarcolepsy but that's insomnia but\nsupplementation to improve the quality\nor duration of sleep or both\nseems to me like the most direct route\neven though actually technically it's an\nindirect route to to Performance\nenhancement and then thinking about\nthings that increase alertness and\nstimulants and fatigue reducers do you\nthink that's a good logic yeah we go to\nabsurd lengths\nto dial sleep in as much as we can I\nmean the honest answer is like truly\nabsurd this is a conflict of interest\nthat my company I'm a part of this\nabsolute rest is anyone that company we\nactually go out to your house\nand run a full clinical grade sleep\nstudy in you your bedroom on you and run\nthat over multiple nights so instead of\nhaving to go to a Sleep Clinic and have\nit done in this weird hospital room or\nsort of setting with these people\nlooking at you through a mirror it's\nlike totally creepy\num that is important because that's the\nonly way to truly determine how you are\nsleeping now that said the technology of\nwearable trackers is getting better in\nfact I would actually predict those\nthings will reach a level of accuracy\nequivalent to the PSG in the next couple\nof years and probably will get FDA\napproval to be able to diagnose\nofficially Sleep Disorders\num that's my total my prediction from\nsome inside information I don't know\nthat to be true but it is getting a lot\nbetter right now those wearables are not\naccurate enough to meet that threshold\nso the we do is we bring up basically\nall the equipment to do that so we'll\ncome in and do that now once we\nunderstand exactly how you're sleeping\nthe next question is to answer why are\nyou sleeping that way and so this is a\nfull four-fold system number one is\nwe're going to look at biology which\nmeans you're going to take saliva and\nblood\nand we're looking at everything from\nneurotransmitters concentrations to\nvitamins B6 B12 Etc that are important\nfor Sleep performance so we're going to\nsee is that is it a physiological\nproblem is there something happening\nthere is cortisol DHEA ratio that we've\npreviously talked about or is something\nlike that off\nif it's not physiology then we're going\non the next one which is environmental\nwe run a full environmental scan of your\nbedroom during those nights of sleep\nthat were there and that's really\nimportant because we can look at\neverything from dander and pollen and\nallergens that are in the air a quick\ntip here is wash your sheets at least\nonce a week one of the common most\ncommon places that people get allergens\nin the air is actually from accumulation\non your sheets so if you clean those\nmore often you'll be in a better spot\nand next one the next one there also is\nlike keep your I'm sorry this hurts my\nheart I don't even I\nin in truthfulness I violate this but\nkeep your pets out of your bedroom and\ncertainly keep them off your bed\nour Ghost Face Killer is my dog and\nmilky is my other one they don't go on\nmy bed but they're right next to my bed\nso we violate that one but full\nenvironmental scan includes all those\nthings of course there's we measure\nlight and temperature and humidity and\neverything else that's going on in the\nroom\num volatile Organics that are coming out\nof the mattress formaldehyde lead out of\nthe wall like all these things that\ncould potentially disrupt your sleep and\nwe want to make sure that none of those\nthings are kicking on uh we see this\nconstantly people will have things like\ntrying to be cool and they want to be\ncold at night because that's important\nand so they'll turn an air conditioner\non or a fan but the air conditioner\nkicking on and off at night actually can\nshoot you out of various sleep stations\nso you want to be really careful about\nit's going the last metric on that is\nactually CO2\nand so what you remember from our\nmetabolism discussion is when you exhale\nyou're breathing out CO2 well if your\nroom is closed and the ventilation isn't\ngreat the amount of CO2 in your room\nstarts to build up and we actually very\nspecifically know the threshold based on\ninformation collected from the\nInternational Space Station actually we\nknow the Threshold at which CO2 crosses\nand starts disrupting sleep so we want\nto make sure that you're not sitting in\nthis CO2 bath in front of your face and\nthen breathing it back in and disrupting\nyour sleep so environment is the second\none the third one\nis actually now psychology so\num one of the members on our team is a\nHarvard MD in Psychiatry and put\ntogether an entire sleep scan survey so\nwe run through all that to see if\nthere's anxiety depression anything like\nthat psychologically going on and then\nthe first fourth one there is if you\nhave some sort of actual sleep pathology\nand so this again will include some eye\ntracking stuff that we can use so we\ntake all those data they go back to our\nteam uh we work in combination with with\nSteve Locke from Harvard who's done a\nton of stuff he actually set up a lot of\nthe Circadian rhythm stuff in the\nNational Space Station as well uh\nhimself Jeffrey Drummer and MD PhD Etc\nand all these folks in a room go over\nyour data\nidentify what's going on then build\naction plans off of that occasionally\nthose action plans will include\nsupplementation but only if necessary\nwe're really going to try to come back\nand work through a system to improve the\nSleep however is needed so I realize\nthat is not totally accessible\nfor a lot of people but like if you\nreally need to go to the end of the\nEarth to figure out sleep that service\nis available absolute rest sounds like\nan amazing tool given that most people\nwon't be able to use it\num or access it although we will provide\na link in case people are interested in\nit and do want to try it\nyou mentioned a few things that I think\neveryone should uh assay their sleeping\nenvironment for and um determine whether\nor not they are hindering their sleep\nwithout realizing for instance the air\nconditioning going on and off or this\ncould be heater going on and off or um\ncentral heating or cooling unit\num this could be keeping the room dark\nuh this could be cleaning your sheets\ncertainly that doesn't require\num uh that one sign up for absolute rest\nso cleaning one sheets routinely keeping\npets out of the bedroom as you admitted\nyou don't entirely\num different opinions about that but if\nyou're having sleep issues the dander\nfrom animals may be part of those issues\nand then one that I'll just add which I\nthink is pretty interesting is there's\nsome beautiful data out of Michael\nturman's Lab at Columbia Medical School\nin New York on negative ionization and\nthis sounds pretty uh wacky kind of new\nAGP I'm sure some people like do a\nnegative ionization but listen the\nTurman lab is a serious laboratory focus\non circadian biology for many decades\nnow negative ion concentrations are\nhigher near Coastal locations so if\nyou've ever gone to the sea or gone on\nvacation and you sleep better near a\nbody of water that's actually a real\nthing and there are negative ionization\nmachines but there are also some things\nthat one can do in order to increase the\nnegative ion concentration in their\nsleeping environment that are nearly\nzero cost if not zero cost you can look\nthose up online and we probably will do\nan entire episode about this in the\nfuture but I think what you described\nfor absolute rest really highlights a\nmore General set of themes that I think\nare really important which is your sleep\nenvironment is an environment it's got a\nlot going on in it and it's worth\nrunning through the checklist that you\ndescribed and asking you know where\nwhere things you know maybe not\noptimized but where am I really getting\nin my own way in terms of sleep all of\nthis again being related to the fact\nthat getting excellent sleep\nconsistently is a completely transform\neverything that you do and not getting\nexcellent sleep consistently which is a\nchallenge for so so many people will\nalso transform everything that you do\nand think and feel but in the negative\nDirection yeah I can also offer a few\ntips on sleep based on things we find\nmost consistently for those that can't\ngo through uh the whole protocol\num one quick little actually app called\ntime shifter is really cool for anyone\nthat's dealing with consistent travel\nand jet lag so you can go and enter your\nlocation your time where you're going\nwith the location and then it'll\nactually back calculate and it'll give\nyou full light uh stimulant food\nhydration and stuff protocol and you\njust follow along with that and we've\nused that for many years actually\nespecially when traveling to like Abu\nDhabi for vice and Mongolia and and\nBrazil for the Olympics and sort of all\nover the place so that's I think that\napp is still available I hope so um it's\ngreat\num a nice tool um a couple of things we\nfound major if you're dealing with acid\nreflux so if you're someone who has\nproblems like that you can just Elevate\nthe head of your bed by like six inches\nso if you you know put little piece of\nwood or something underneath it you can\nalso buy very inexpensive pillows that\ncan Elevate that now that's not solving\nthe problem but at least can help you\nsleep whether it's just that night or if\nit's a consistent problem you can do\nthere\num if you're snoring\nlike I said it's not really benign you\nshould probably take a look at that your\nfirst step there is mouth tape if that\ndoesn't work you can go through what's\ncalled myofunctional therapy\num which I don't know if you've covered\nthat before but it's basically tongue\nexercises and that can be quite\neffective specifically for people who\nhave problems with REM sleep so\nmyofunctional therapy\num it's just a it's kind of like you do\nlike depending on the protocol uh some\ntongue exercises kind of the morning\nafternoon or night and that takes a\nwhile to be honest you're probably going\nto need at least six weeks before you\nstart seeing anything but that actually\nis is pretty well demonstrated to help\nus sleep so you can probably Google we\ncould find a link for for exact\nprotocols I don't want to describe all\nthem but yeah you're going to strengthen\nyour tongue so that it stops falling in\nthe back of your neck and waking you up\nat night so that's a really free easy\nfree protocol to use\num if you're struggling with\nno it could be insomnia but it could be\njust things like when you get into bed\nyou're super tired and you can't fall\nasleep or things like that kind of a\nbasic rule of thumb we use is only two\nthings happen in your bed and if you can\nmake sure those are the only two things\nyou do in your bed the problems of\nfalling asleep or insomnia tend to go\ndown those two things are you have sex\nand you sleep and nothing else goes down\nin your bed and so you can make that\nenvironment very special and that can\nhelp uh quite effectively improve your\nability to fall asleep and then not wake\nup early so keeping that environment\nspecific to what it's for uh can be\neffective\nthe only other thing I would think of is\nand I hate to say this because it's not\nsuper practical but\nit's just quite clear at this point\nsleeping with a partner in your bed it's\njust not very good for sleep so good\nluck with that one I know\num you can do a couple of things if it\nhelps uh you can get two smaller beds\nand put them right next to each other if\nyou can actually have separate sheets\nthat alone can be helpful\num so if you get I mean if you're on a\nking-sized bed or something and again I\nknow some people they're just like\nthere's no chance but if you want to\nknow the cost for your like the\noh my goodness so\num the only last thing I want to mention\nhere is something that's popped up just\na few times recently but you're going to\nsee more of uh which is called\northosomnia\nuh so that is a term that is people are\ngrowing concerned over uh which is\nwearables and sleep trackers causing\nsleep issues so people be basically\nbecome too obsessed with optimizing\nmaximizing scores and that alone will\nactually it's actually you so you learn\nwhen to wake up and so you have actually\nuh an anticipatory response when many\nhours prior to waking up so if you\nactually learn to have a little bit of a\nwhat's a little molecule of like\nexcitement and reward oh dopamine that's\nthe one if you start getting that\nbecause you wake up and you get super\nexcited to check your score or your\nphone it's the same thing if you check\nyour phone or Twitter or whatever\nimmediately morning that'll actually\nstart carving back your wake up time\nbecause you start launching it so it can\nruin sleep becoming too obsessed so what\nI'll say is if you're going to use a\nsleep tracker\nand you just like don't care you want to\ncheck it and you have fun with it great\nbut if like you are really really\ninterested in it and you pay a lot of\nattention to it don't check your sleep\nscore for at least the first 60 minutes\nafter waking up and then you'll that\nshould help you that's a great tool I\nthink that\num end piece of advice I think generally\nbecause I think a lot of people are\nwaking up in the middle of the night\nchecking their phone two or three times\nper night I'm kind of wondering why\nthey're doing that and I'm guessing it's\nthis anticipatory wake-up circuit yeah\nyou absolutely should use either your\nnight mode or do not disturb or airplane\nmode or something overnight or leave it\nout of the room yeah I mean if you have\nto wake up and like some people have um\nlike a family member who's maybe not in\ngreat health and so they have to get\ntheir phone around in case they call or\nthings like that so I get it you're like\nI can't leave it out leave it in there\nleave it in do not disturb and enter in\ntheir phone number or whoever's phone\nnumber so only they can get through but\nkeep it black and white so if you do\nhave to look at your phone at night you\nsee black and white and you do not have\nnotifications so make sure that there's\nno notification for no email and a no DM\nlike get all that stuff off your screen\nand so you look at the did anybody call\ndid anybody text of importance\num what time is it no emergency going on\nblack and white okay right back to sleep\nso that can help a little bit one of the\nsupplements that I found is extremely\nuseful for being able to fall back\nasleep if I've woken up in the middle of\nthe night and for some reason can't\num and is also very effective for\nenhancing sleep when one is ingesting\nfewer carbohydrates an issue that a lot\nof people run into or\nfor people that are fasting for many\nhours before sleep you know people are\ntrying to not eat anything within you\nknow two to four hours but is inositol\n900 milligrams of my myoinositol I I\nfind again this is anec data to be clear\nthat if I wake up in the middle of the\nnight and I've taken 900 milligrams of\ninositol B4 initially falling asleep\nthat I fall back asleep much more easily\nso that's why I've added 900 milligrams\nof inositol to my so-called sleep stack\nI've also tried just taking it alone and\nit works well alone but it works better\nof course with the mag 3 and 8 apogenic\nthemine sleep stack the um that also in\nterms of tools for Sleep the the app\nreverie that was developed by my\ncolleague Dr David Spiegel who's a\nmedical doctor at Stanford Psychiatry\nStanford School of Medicine Psychiatry\nthere is a free trial there's a nominal\ncost if you use it\num month to month but the data are\nreally strong that people that use that\nI think it's 8 to 11 minute sleep\nhypnosis once a week and it doesn't have\nto be in the middle of the night when\nyou wake up really helps improve\npeople's ability to fall asleep quickly\nstay asleep fall back asleep if they\nwake up in the middle of the night in\nsome cases curing insomnia in other\ncases really just helping people with\ntheir General sleep issues and I\nmentioned this because obviously it's\nthe technology it's not a supplement but\nI know that some people are supplement\ndiverse also if you look at by at the\ncost comparison between taking the Sleep\nstack totally\num and the reverie app it's Pennies on\nthe dollar really\num so again I'm a proponent of both for\nmyself but I realize that people have\nvarying budgets and again\nI should say as always behavioral tools\nfirst and I think of the reverie app as\nmore or less a behavioral tool yeah it's\nuh it's really just a tool any of these\nbreath work protocols hypnosis protocols\nthey're just a tool for you to touch\nback in with your own physiology rather\nthan a a substance that's coming in so I\nfully support those we have used a\nnumber of those\num in in protocols\nthere's some other tricks that we can\npull in those areas\num I probably shouldn't say this but the\nreal of it is depending on what's\nkeeping you up sometimes we recommend\njust getting up and getting it done\nlike if it's a really like if it's a\na project or a thing or whatever like\nsometimes it rather than laying there\nall night not sleeping you can get up\nget it done and then if you stay awake\nfine at least the anxiety is gone\nor sometimes you can actually go back to\nsleep because you're like especially if\nthe task only literally would take like\n10 or 15 minutes\num it may ruin your sleep but you're\nyou're going to have room sleep anyways\nso you can try that tool um you don't\nwant to pull that card very often and\nyou have to have be very careful with\nwhat you consider to be something Worthy\nof doing that but that is like between\nme and you and nobody else here that's a\ntool I have used personally more than a\nfew times where it's just like\nI get an idea I don't lose it or like\nthe solution for something you've been\nnoodling on for a long time Pops in your\nhead and just like and you're not\nwanting to forget it just get up get it\ndone and\nget on with your day\nin several previous episodes you\nemphasized how exercise induces various\nadaptations depending on the type\nspecificity volume intensity Etc of the\nexercise and that during exercise the\ndegree of adaptation that one triggers\nis often associated with things that\nnormally we don't associate with\nexercise related health things like\nhuge increases in blood pressure during\nexercise huge increases in inflammatory\nmarkers\nmuscle damage right these all things all\nsound terrible but as you beautifully\nexplained all of that triggers\nadaptations that then bring those\nmarkers below the Baseline\nwith which they were previous to the\nexercise so that's the adaptation in the\nrecovery within the Romo supplementation\nof nutrition I'm aware of a number of\nthings\nsome herbal some lipid-based\nother compounds that are used for\nvarious things but that are known to\nhave a potent anti-inflammatory effect\nthings like\nomega-3 fatty acids ashwagandha for its\neffect on cortisol although that's a bit\nindirect to the inflammatory pathway\num\ncurcumin and things of that sort given\nthat we want\ninflammation in order to trigger the\nadaptation response to exercise\nand given that we want to reduce\ninflammation in the recovery period can\nwe put together a logical framework as\nto when is best to take anything\nanti-inflammatory whether it's\nsupplement base or prescription or\nover-the-counter drug and when to\nstrictly avoid taking any\nanti-inflammatory supplement or\num a behavioral tool you mentioned ice\ncan reduce inflammation that's why you\ndon't want to do it too close to\nexercise anyway I think you get the gist\nof the question what about specific\nsupplements related to inflammation and\nanti-inflammatory responses what are the\nbest ones when should we take them when\nshould we avoid taking them the way that\nI think about it is understanding what\nwe call the fitness fatigue model so\nwhat I mean by that is whenever you do\nsome sort of insult the whole idea is\nfor you to come back and get an\nadaptation now recovery is not\nadaptation right recovers recovery\nadaptation is what happens after you're\nrecovered right so it's a very important\ndistinction there Fitness fatigue model\nsays basically you've done something and\nyou've got an adaptation and you've\nenhanced Fitness\nand by Fitness in this case I mean it as\na non-specific term so you got stronger\nyou've improved your endurance like\nwhatever thing you're trying to train\nfor at the same time though you're\nfatigue elevated so what happens is if\nFitness increases at the same or similar\nrate as fatigue your performance\nactually isn't any better\nand so you may think oh my program isn't\nworking I need to then train harder or I\nneed to take more anti-inflammatory or\nwhatever the things are when reality all\nyou really need to do is reduce fatigue\nand if you do that your performance will\nincrease and all the training\nadaptations will be actualized so the\nway that we do that is a couple of\nthings first and foremost is actually a\ntaper\nso the the first step I think of if\nsomeone is training very very hard and\nyou're not seeing any results and we\nwant to think about supplementation\nbefore I get there I want to think about\ntaper and deload if you're actually\ntraining hard and sleep and everything\nelse is taken care of so just without\ngoing too far into taper some general\nGeneral parameters there you want to\nthink about about a 50 reduction in\ntraining volume\nover the course of About a Week for\nevery eight weeks of training\nsuper super rough right so if you've\nbeen training hard for three months for\nsomething\nyou might want to taper for two weeks\nsomething like that right it's sort of a\nrough estimate\nthat taper you actually don't need to\nreduce intensity\nbecause intensity is not the driver of\nfatigue it tends to be volume so as long\nas your volume is reduced by 50 you can\nmaintain intensity you can maintain in\nfact I generally would recommend\nmaintaining frequency so if you're used\nto working out four days a week keep it\nfour days a week you can go down a\nlittle bit in frequency but if you go\ndown too much in frequency you actually\ntend to feel super lethargic\nso I wouldn't do that if you do those\nthings correctly\nyou can typically see somewhere between\nlike a three to eight percent\nImprovement of performance\num within a matter of days so it's\nimportant to do that um we actually ran\na study on cross-country Runners years\nago testing on a metabolic heart muscle\nbiopsies blood a whole bunch of things\nand we did it pre and post three weeks\nof taper and we actually this is cool\nbecause we did this in competitive\nseason so these were Collegiate\ncross-country Runners and we got them to\ncome to our lab three weeks before their\nconference Championship ran them all\nthrough a bunch of testing biopsied them\nthey went through their three-week taper\nand then we biopsied them again and then\nthey went and ran\num their conference championships and\nstuff well what happened was they end up\nhitting about a 50 reduction because\nwhat they did is they took out what we\ncall the junk volume so they kept their\nrace tempos high intensity stuff in\nthere they kept the recovery stuff and\nthen that Medium Pace they just\nbasically reduced now they were\nterrified as any endurance Runner or\nDare it's athlete or participant would\nunderstand when you take volume away\nthey tend to get very nervous and so\nthey didn't like like that but as a\nresult of that what we saw is their VO2\nmax despite the fact that they covered\nhalf the mileage their VO2 max did not\ngo down in three weeks of reduced taper\nyour Fitness is is extremely stable and\nin fact once we actually looked at their\ndata the enzymes in their muscle will be\nresponsible for oxidative metabolism\nwere maintained and so you don't have to\nworry about losing uh Again Fitness\nwhether we're talking about overall\nperformance or even oxygen capacity\nmitochondrial function\nEtc that was all preserved\nobviously we saw performance go up what\nwas actually really interesting is we\nsaw I think it was around a 10 percent\nincrease in type 2 which are fast twitch\nmuscle fiber size\nso we saw a 10 percent increase in fast\nfood fiber size at the end of three\nweeks of tapering\nnow what you may think is like wow I\nguess tapering is anabolic but that's\nprobably not what happened what\nrealistically probably happened was\ntheir volume of training\nwas actually causing their fibers to be\nreduced in size and then once we removed\nthat fatigue they just recovered back to\nnormal\nso that's a good example of what I'm\ntalking about once you remove the\nfatigue you can actually see\nenhancements in performance not because\nyou're necessarily getting better but\nbecause you're removing the simulated\nsuppressing you so that being said\nthe way that you want to think about\nrecovery like this is although recovery\nespecially like injury recovery like\nseems chaotic biology is very organized\nand there's a very specific three-step\nprocess that you're going to go through\nfor recovery and then there are\ndifferent supplements that can help you\nin each of those three areas so area one\nis basically inflammation so this is\nwhen the cytokine storm comes rolling\nout it starts signaling the injuries\nthere in this case even if it's muscle\ndamage and activates the immune system\nto kick on and that whole repair process\nhappens there\num what you're trying to do effectively\nin fact this is why you probably ever\nwonder like why is inflammation a thing\nand what you're trying to do is bring in\nfluid enhance the size and increase\nblood flow in so you can get nutrients\nfor repair and immune cells and\neverything like that in the system and\nget the waste out so short-term\ninflammation even in the case of muscle\nsoreness is the example we we talked\nabout in the previous episode but any\ninflammation it is part of the necessary\nprocess that's why you would not want to\ntake an anti-inflammatory in that state\nand so why you also would not want to do\nthings like an ice bath so in that\nimmediate inflammatory response time\nwindow this is you know seconds to hours\nafter training you would want to stay\naway from things like that\num a good option here are things like\nOmega-3s good evidence something\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of like\ntwo to five grams total\ntypically like a one-to-one EPA to DHA\nratio is fine similarly this is another\nexample of when good doesn't mean more\nis better because for example there is\nactually evidence showing up to 15 grams\nwill harm the immune response\nand so you don't just want to be like\nman I'm super sore I'm training harder\nI'm just going to go to 10 grams a year\nmore and more you're actually causing\nyourself more of a problem so\nantioxidants anti-inflammatories are\nfine again Omega-3s in that dosage are a\ndecent thing you can also do something\nlike 500 milligrams of curcumin three\ntimes a day that's going to be enough to\nkeep you in a decent spot there are some\nother things that you could look up\nmaybe some potential benefit for ginger\nand baswellia and some things like that\nfor inflammation but\nunder unless we're in like very specific\ncircumstances where we have like an\ninjury we're probably not going to those\nyou know areas I just wanted to\nhighlight one thing that came up in a\nprevious episode some not all people but\nsome including myself are very sensitive\nto curcumin yep it has a very potent\neffect in reducing\nDHT dihydro testosterone and leads to\nall sorts of clamping of\ntestosterone-associated positive things\nso\num I have experienced that myself I've\nhad people write to me and say I don't\nunderstand I started taking a supplement\ncurcumin is supposed to be a great\nanti-inflammatory it flatlined my libido\nit took away my drive and kind of\nwondering what's going on there those\npeople are very likely to be very DHT\nsensitive curcumin while it's a potent\nanti-inflammatory can also potently\nreduce DHT but some people tolerate it\nquite well and are hearing this and\nprobably think that's ridiculous well\nit's certainly substantiated by the\nbiochemical Pathways that curcumin Taps\ninto in the known roles of DHT on libido\naggression power output Etc and mood so\njust be wary that\num a there's no way to predict this one\nsimply has to figure it out empirically\nmeaning you have to try and see if you\nlike it or don't the good news is is\nthose negative effects on DHT can to\nreverse pretty quickly after\nceasing to take curcumin so just a\nmention of something that came up in a\nprevious episode but in case people\ndidn't hear that on that segment um just\nwanted to highlight those those facts\nfurther evidence do I I strongly\ndiscourage\nstrongly discourage taking anything in\nthe anti-inflammatory antioxidant realm\nunless you actually have a reason to do\nso if you're waking up and you're like\nmaybe I'm inflamed that's probably not a\ngood approach right let's have a reason\nto do so step two is actually what we\ncall proliferation and that's kind of\nlike the cleanup crew that's when you're\ngoing to be going in there and cleaning\nout dead cells and debris and misfolded\nproteins and things like that at this\nstage a fantastic evidence-based\nsupplement is glutamine glutamine 20\ngrams a day we typically honestly split\nit up into two dosage 10 grams morning\n10 grams a night it's a conditional\namino acid which means\nyou can make it your body can make\nenough of it at times and other times\nyou may want to support it generally\nthose conditional times are things like\nburn victims high stress situations or\ninjury things like that so there isn't\nalso like a ton of downside to glutamine\nbecause it can go through transamination\nwhich means your body can take it and\nsay like we don't need anything here for\nour Muscle Recovery let's make it into\nsomething else and use it\num\nfor whatever else is needing so it's\nkind of another one of these like low\nrisk uh products is also why you see it\nin a lot of recovery products if you're\never wondering like what the heck is\nthat in there I don't need amino acids\nand you're thinking it's like for\nprotein synthesis it's really not it's\nbecause of this it is uh beneficial to\nthis proliferation process\nI've been taking glutamine for years\num I tend to take it\nin higher dosages several times\nthroughout the day if I remember feeling\nparticularly run down I know there are\ndecent data not great but decent data on\nthe role of glutamine for leaky gut\ntotally we're off saying leaky gut\nthat's getting a little bit into the\nrealm of uh like not super well\nsubstantiated but in the in the\npeer-reviewed literature but some a lot\nof anecdata and um and certainly some\npeer-reviewed work but not a ton and\nthen there is also growing interest in\nthe idea that glutamine\nbecause it can trigger activation of the\nneurons in the gut that signal to the\ndopamine pathway in the brain that it\ncan be used to offset sugar Cravings\nthis is kind of an interesting new uh an\nemerging theme which makes sense given\nthe biology of the neurons in the gut\nthat respond to specific amino acids\nincluding glutamine essential fatty\nacids and sugar and because they respond\nto any uh and all three of those\nanyone or\ncombination of those I should say to\ntrigger this dopamine response some\npeople have taken to a teaspoon or so of\ngluten of glutamine in some water or\nother drink a couple times throughout\nthe day as a way to reduce their sugar\nCravings because what it's essentially\ndoing is it's tricking the pathway into\ninto activation of those neurons through\nan alternate ligand receptor interaction\nright also another interesting point\nthere are very\nI'm trying to think right now off the\ntop of my head I can't think of a time\nand I've used glutamine a lot I can't\nthink of a time where I've ever heard\nanybody come back with any side effect\nreports I think if you take enough of it\nyou can get some gastric distress but of\ncourse you take enough of any powdered\nsubstance\nmixed in water you're going to get a\ngastric distress response and what I've\nnoticed about gastric distress with\nthings like creatine glutamine and even\nprotein powders for that matter I use a\nhigh quality whey protein powder\nroutinely is that if you build up to it\nover the course of a few days then you\ncan get away with using much higher\ndosages without any issue yeah yeah um\nbeta alanine is the same thing by the\nway we sort of talked about that earlier\nif uh you've ever tried that and you're\nlike oh my gosh like I feel like I've\njust rolled around in grass and my skin\nis itching everywhere what's that ants\nunder the skin sensation yeah all that\nstuff yeah you can just take a little\nbit of a lower dosage and be fine but\nfor the most part and then you will\nbuild up a tolerance to that pretty\nquickly so you can up that dosage along\nthe way so what we will oftentimes do\nthere start at a dosage that's pretty\nminimal like 2 grams and then every week\nor so you can go up another gram until\nyou get to whatever final point you want\nto be five six grams a day you know\nwhatever so that's another way you can\nsort of mitigate that problem so the\nthird step in this recovery process\nafter inflammation proliferation we're\nnow into Remodeling and this is when\nyou're actually you know quote unquote\ngrowing back bigger and stronger\num this is where the majority of the\nrepair is actually taking place and at\nthis point we're basically playing a\nmicronutrient and macronutrient game\nright by that I mean we've talked about\nbasic macronutrients one thing to pay\nattention to oftentimes if people are\nhurt whether they had an injury or\nthey've had uh just they're super sore\nand they are concerned about eating\nexcess calories\nthey tend to want to eat less food\nduring this process because they're like\nI'm not working out so much so I'm gonna\neat less calories well one of the things\nthat you have to pay attention to is\ninjury can increase basal metabolic rate\nby up to 10 percent wow so what you want\nto do in general is just take your\ncalories up about 10 at least that's\nwhat I recommend\num if that is an extended period of time\nthen yes you may put on a slight amount\nof body fat or something but if that\nalso means you come back some percentage\nfaster then it's worth the exchange so\nwe recommend that in terms of your\ncarbohydrate or fat split I'm not super\nworried about it my general\nrecommendation is just don't make any\nmajor changes relative to what you were\ndoing right keep yourself pretty much in\nthe same spot\nin terms of protein this is the big one\nyou want to make sure you're absolutely\nat one gram per pound of body weight\nbecause we need those amino acids to\ncome in and start helping with recovery\none gram of protein per pound of body\nweight or more or one gram or more yeah\nI mean there's gonna be very little\ndownside to having more\num\nremember\nprotein\nand carbohydrates both stimulate insulin\nand remember insulin is anabolic and so\nwe're trying to drive this process of\nrecovery that's why you want both so you\nwouldn't want to skimp on carbohydrates\nin this phase nor would you want to\nskimp on protein because you need the\nactivation the drive into the tissue as\nwell as the structure going back to one\nof our earlier conversations and at this\npoint in the week I honestly can't\nremember at all what episode we covered\nthis in but I gave an analogy about use\nmaking a campfire and using fat and\ncarbohydrates is the wood and the log\nand the protein were the the metal\nstructure so you need that Supply if\nyou're trying to bank if you've cleared\nout in the previous step damaged\nproteins and you need to make new ones\nto recover that process you have to have\nthe raw Supply and material so you\nwouldn't want to avoid either one of\nthose things there's actually some\nindirect inflammation management that\ncomes from fatty acids which you\nactually sort of alluded to earlier I\ndon't think you need to necessarily go\ncrazy you don't need to change your fat\nintake that much just don't drop it you\nknow I depending on where you're at so\nif you're a little bit of a higher carb\nlower fat person great if you're\nmoderate great if you're the indirect if\nyou're higher fat lower carb person\nawesome just don't make an extreme\nchange and don't and try to not be on\nthe extremes of either one of those\nratios but the only specific number to\npay attention to again is that protein\nnumber and if you go a little bit high\nor even a lot high it's totally fine\njust don't go low\nso that's the the macronutrient portion\nof remodeling in terms of micronutrients\nto be honest you just get your bases\ncovered this is when a basic\nmultivitamin is effective what you're\nreally trying to look at here are\nvitamin A and zinc they actually have\nindependent mechanisms that are helpful\nhere but those are typically covered in\nmost multivitamins so we generally just\ngive people a multivitamin magnesium is\nactually has some some benefits here\nsomething like six milligrams per\nkilogram of body weight is the dosage\nyou're looking for there\nmagnesium citrate is probably has the\nmost evidence in terms of this respect\nbut it doesn't mean I actually have no\nreason to think you couldn't use\nglycinate or if you're using another\nform for sleep that's probably fine I\ndon't know that for sure but I can't\nthink of a reason why the other forms of\nmagnesium would all of a sudden not work\nso you could probably choose whichever\nform you like um albeit citrate has\nprobably the most research in this\naspect the only other things you would\nprobably consider here\nthree things calcium might be on your\nlist particularly if you're trying to if\nyou're concerned with some sort of bone\ninjury and we've sort of gone past like\nrecovering we're actually like into\ninjury so you'll see that in recovery\nproducts occasionally and that's why and\nthen the last two ones of course are\nvitamin D and that's pretty well\nresearched\nand then the last one is actually uh\nsomething that can help you if you're at\nthis stage\nand you still are dealing with a lot of\nsoreness or not and that is tart cherry\njuice and that's actually effective for\nboth Dom's muscle injury muscle soreness\nand actually has another benefit of\npotentially aiding with sleep so I'm not\na bad one to turn to as well there's a\nnumber of companies that make these\nthings\num yeah and then there's actually more\nongoing research that I know of on those\nareas but a promising literature we'll\nsay not often but every once in a while\non this podcast I will solicit social\nmedia for questions from the audience\nwhere I should say the audience to be\nand then ask some of those questions on\nthe fly during the podcast I did this\nwith Dr Lex Friedman\nI'm going to do it with you\nyour goal is to answer each of these\nquestions certainly not all of them\nthousands of them within the last couple\nof hours to answer each of these\nquestions\nin three or four sentences I certainly\nwon't be counting the number of\nsentences that you speak so just know\nthat if you want to go over a little bit\nthat's fine but feel free to refer to\nyour Instagram site at a future time\nwhere you might go more in depth or to\nrefer to a study or um if you like you\ncan also say pass if you don't think\nthat you can answer the question\num succinctly enough for this format and\nhere the goal is not to put you on the\nspot the goal is simply to allow the\naudience to ask some questions directly\nand I I confess I'm looking at these for\nthe first time so I'll try and be quick\nwith my with my reading\num some of these we may have touched on\nin previous episodes or in this episode\neven in which case you can just kind of\ncue us to the reminder\nthis is not directly related to\nsupplementation but it is related to\nnutrition and I don't think we touched\non this directly can we do intermittent\nfasting AKA time restricted feeding with\nketo and still gain muscle mass\nTBD\nthe I am quite clear such study does not\nexist so I don't know I think I've\nalluded to before that we did run an\nintermittent fasting 16-8 hypertrophy\nstudy there was no keto arm the results\nof that study by the time this comes out\nwe'll probably be ready though I'm not\nsure so I can't comment on I haven't\nlooked at the data\nbut regarding whether or not if you did\nthat with keto or not I can't comment\nscientifically\ndo you ever prescribe the use of Gaba\nsupplements\nwell I can't prescribe anything to make\nsure we're clear but you're a professor\nyou can profess I can profess uh we\ngenerally don't spend too much time on\nGaba rarely\nis it okay to weight train fasted than\nnot\nbreak the fast and eat for three or four\nhours after training so in other words\ntrain fasted I do this but then also not\neat immediately following training and\nwait another three to four hours after\ntraining once we have our results remind\nfasting study back we will we will have\na better answer here my\nGeneral recommendation as it stands now\nthough is as long as your total protein\nintake is sufficient you should be\nin a decent spot\ngreat a lot of questions about fasting\nand training just to yeah to know that\num can you train high performance fasted\nand how long before\num you need to refuel the body yeah you\ncan certainly do that I know of actually\nmany athletes some athletes that will do\nthat though the vast majority will not\nas it gets higher and higher in\nintensity and or duration it gets more\nchallenging but it really does come down\nto what you did the day before as well\nso if you ate sufficient calories a day\nbefore didn't train and your glycogen\nstores are topped off\nyou have a fighting chance now the\nduration part of that equation is really\nkind of dependent upon you\num so are you really talking 30 45\nminutes 16 minutes you're probably fine\nwhether you're out past that in several\nhours you may not be and then the only\nother comment I would make is there is\nkeep in mind whenever you think about\nfasting and any other let's say against\nthe textbook you know quote unquote\nstyle you really really need to be\ncareful in thinking the difference\nbetween can I do it and is it optimal so\nI have absolutely no reason to think\nfasting like that would improve\nperformance\nI only work for the most part with\npeople who are trying to perform at the\nhighest level possible so I can't think\nof a scenario which I would go too\nfasting to try to enhance performance so\nwhether or not you can maintain some\nlevel of performance probably will it\nprovide any benefit I struggle to find\nscenarios in which that would actually\nmake you perform better\nhow do different forms of carbohydrates\nimpact performance and then right below\nit another question about carbohydrates\nwhich is does carbohydrate cycling work\nso these are\ntwo uh\nquestions from people that I think don't\nknow one another but a lot of questions\nabout carbohydrates and performance\nwhich we've touched on anything else\nthat you want to add to that\nconversation\nI don't think I really maybe you might\nwant to think about carb loading uh\nSlash carb cycling so carbohydrate\nloading does help however a\nmisconception there is it's just you\nknow a big bowl of pasta the night\nbefore\nthat can help top off storages but\nreally optimal carbohydrate loading\nprior to a long duration endurance\nperformance is probably best over the\ncourse of three or four days so you want\nto gradually increase carbohydrate\nintake for multiple days rather than\njust have one big bowl of pasta\nBranch chain amino acids and essential\namino acid supplementation yay nay or as\nI would say meh uh meh usually if your\ntotal protein intake is fine then you\ndon't really have a need for them\num if you're for whatever any number of\nvalid reasons total protein is not then\ngoing to an essential amino acid would\nbe my first step rather than a BCAA now\nadmittedly we actually do use\nessential amino acids somewhat regularly\nbecause it's also sort of like a there's\nno real harm other than if you're price\nconscious and you're sort of like I'm\nwasting money that's fine the people I\nwork with generally again that's not a\nfew dollars for\nto maximize recoveries is not that very\nso we will sometimes use that\npre-meter post training in some\ncircumstances uh total protein would be\nmy a high quality way something like\nthat\num if you can't use whey for whatever\nreason there are plenty of high quality\nvegan proteins you could use if you want\nto top all that off though and add some\nessential amino acids it wouldn't hurt\nanything and may potentially help\nslightly so you choose based on that\nalgorithm ah I was hoping somebody would\nask this I've touched on it a little bit\nit's a little bit of a loaded question\nthe way they phrased it so um at risk of\nleading the witness does the mythical\nanabolic window really exist and I'm\njust laughing because the way they posed\nthe question they're already telling us\nwhat their stance is\num making it more effective as to create\nhypertrophy to eat within a certain time\nframe after working out I'm going to\nassume that this person genuinely wants\nto know whether or not the anabolic\nwindow\nreally exists or not\num because they\nrefer to it as mythical I'm going to\nassume that they're\num suspicious but what's the deal as the\nanabolic window a real thing the\npost-exercise anabolic window is\nextremely real so what this is uh you\ncan see more detail in a number of\nvideos on my YouTube page I believe it\nis the idea that you need to must\nconsume some sort of nutrients\nspecifically usually protein in the some\ntime domain 30 or 60 Minutes a post\nexercise in order to maximize growth so\nis that window real yes are you hyper\nsensitized to nutrients in that time\nframe yes is it very important that you\nrehydrate replenish muscle glycogen and\nrebuild tissue quickly after exercise to\nmaximize recovery absolutely\nis not real though in the sense that you\nthat you have to have it within 30\nminutes in the case of protein as we\ntalked about a second ago your total\nprotein intake throughout the day is\nmore important\ntiming though for things like\ncarbohydrate especially if you're\ntraining multiple times a day it is very\nreal so it is a very real thing it's\njust you may or may not actually care\nabout it it may not be important for\nyour context\ngarlic seems like an appropriate\nquestion\nwhat if any functional roles does garlic\nhave in performance Garlic's actually\nreally cool there's a number of things\nyou can dive into that are outside of my\nthree to four sentences considering I'm\nat like two and a half probably already\num\nyou're not going to find strong human\ndata on garlic extract however there is\na little bit\nsuggesting it can actually enhance\nrecovery from injury or potentially\ntissue damage so\nyou've got to kind of be careful though\nbecause in order to understand what's\nhappening you have to differentiate\nbetween innate an Adaptive recovery\nprocesses\nand when we say things like immunity\nrealize friends that's not one thing\nthat's just like a very colloquial term\nfor a number of things again it's a verb\nlike it's a noun right the immune system\nbut it immunity is a bunch of processes\nor processes if you're about to correct\nmy speech I'll correct yours right back\num not yours Andy yeah listeners\nprocesses tomato tomato\nit's a verb immunity is a verb this is\nmy problem with immune boosters\nsame issue right you're like whoa what\nare you boosting specifically because in\nfact if you're boosting the wrong part\nof unity\nduring the wrong phase of recovery with\ngarlic you may be actually hurting\nin the process because you're\ntheoretically could be trying to down\nregulate that portion so you can\nupregulate a next portion that's the\nfaster way to say it if you will so\num we actually you may see more data\ncome out that says the garlic extracts\noverrated\nI don't know I actually don't even know\nyet we just don't have enough human data\non it but yeah there's some stuff there\nif you want to look hard enough\nI'm going to ask this question for\nmyself\nbecause I'm curious to know the answer\nselfish tart cherry extract pretty\neffective actually for two things uh\npotentially aiding in sleep getting to\nsleep as well as muscle soreness that's\nthe bulk of the research is in muscle\nsoreness and seems to be a moderate\neffect there\nI think for people that might be\ninterested in dosages of things like\ntart cherry extract garlic Etc\num obviously Dr Andy galpin's Instagram\nand Twitter are great places to ask\nquestions like that and to find\nquestions answers to questions like that\nas well as examine.com as a terrific\nwebsite\num they actually recently overhauled\ntheir entire website so they have this\nhuman effect Matrix that shows the\num the effects and the the strength of\ndifferent effects in human studies of\nmany many different compounds\num relating to everything to you know\nHormone Health in men and women sports\nperformance cognitive performance it\ndoesn't cover everything but it\ncertainly covers a lot with links to\nstudies there's a lot that's available\nat completely zero cost by joining\nexamine.com you can access some\nadditional features and this is by the\nway not a paid endorsement from\nexamine.com I'm simply a long time user\nof examine.com myself\num and so I just want a cue people to it\nand again many of the resources there\nare available completely free of costs\nIt's a Wonderful site so for dosages of\ngarlic tart cherry extract and things of\nthat sort whether or not you're getting\nit from food or you're getting it from\nextra powders rather\num all of that information is is pretty\nnicely laid out there so unless you have\nsomething to add to that I was just\ngoing to cue people to that resource no\nI've been using that since the first day\nthat website was launched I I was made\naware that it was coming I've been\nfortunate to know those guys\nfor a while so yeah I've used it I've\nused it in all my classes I use it I\ndon't even know probably weekly at this\npoint another nice feature that's\nactually on there is they have a series\nof\nlike they'll do some topical reviews\nbasically so they'll write a big paper\nout on muscle damage or blood pressure\nor testosterone testosterone enhancement\nor\num hormone uh you know menstrual cycle\nand and yeah PCOS I think they do one on\nand all kinds of stuff so you can search\nby topic uh like you know energy or\nrecovery or whatever or even search by\nyou know black cumin seed extractor like\nwhatever number of things you want to do\nand they'll also tell you if there's any\ninteractions to pay attention to so it's\nreally really nice so be carefully if\nyou're taking a and b or whatever so\nyeah it's wonderful wonderful yeah\nthey've done a marvelous job so thank\nyou examine.com keep keep up the amazing\nwork well we've come close to the end of\nthis episode and that means that we're\nclose to the end of this series where\nyou have so graciously joined us for six\nfull episodes of The huberman Lab\npodcast to educate us on\nall things Fitness\nepisode one\nyou reviewed and educated us on\nassessing our level of Fitness in fact I\nlearned so many ways of assessing\nFitness that I had not thought about and\nalso assessing my recovery capacity for\ninstance one thing that I'm definitely\ngoing to implement from that episode is\na routine broad jump test and uh an\nin-home high jump jump and touch test if\npeople don't know what I'm referring to\nthat's all contained in that episode\nIt's Time stamped these are very\nstraightforward zero cost ways to assess\none's level of Fitness there are a few\nothers that require a bare minimum of\nTechnology like taking your pulse rate\nin very specific ways at specific times\nalso some timing of mile runs and some\nother things relate to strength and\nhypertrophy and on and on really it's a\nit's a buffet of options that we can\nselect from and I already know the four\nor five that I've started implementing\nthis week I've recognized how I'm pretty\ngood in a couple of areas\nI'm doing maybe maybe better than pretty\nwell in one area but that I'm doing a\nabysmally poorly in a few areas that um\nI just wasn't aware of and so I've\nalready started\num taking on ways to uh adjust that over\ntime and I'll keep people posted so that\nfirst episode was absolutely incredible\nand just provides so much actionable\nknowledge and the rationale behind it\nthe second episode you educated us about\nstrength speed and hypertrophy training\nand there too an immense amount of\nincredible knowledge\nwe got way down into the details you\nexplained sets reps the rationale for\nsets reps rest cadence number of\nworkouts per week\nI'm definitely going to take away my\nneed to do some speed Based training and\nsome power Based training normally I\nthink in terms of strength or\nhypertrophy\nand I'm relieved to learn that a lot of\nthe speed and power Based training is\nlow intensity enough that it can be done\nfairly often and incorporated into my\nprogram which already touches on\nstrength and hypertrophy and indeed some\nendurance work as well so amazing tips\nthat you provided there I'm certainly\ngoing to implement the three to five\nprogram that you describe three to five\nexercises done for three to five\nrepetitions\nthree to five minutes\nbetween sets uh you're doing this three\nto five times per week and so on and so\nforth all the details again time stamped\num in the strength and hypertrophy uh\nepisode show note so just incredible we\neven use that to set up PR with you this\nweek that's right I did PR this week\nthanks thanks to your input and\nfollowing that program and um I'm really\ngrateful for that it does feel good to\nbreak through a barrier\num and I intend to break through more\nbarriers but not just with strength and\nhypertrophy because episode three you\ntaught us all about endurance\nthe four different forms of endurance\nhow to train for each of those different\nforms the value of doing even very brief\n22nd\nSprints or bouts of jumping jacks\nthroughout the day which to some people\nmight just sound like a you know like a\nlittle hack or a gimmick but no these\nare actually tapping into fuel systems\nand modes of neuromuscular interactions\nthat greatly Aid other forms of\nendurance like long duration endurance\nI would love to return to my\num High School mile time I won't reveal\nwhat that is because this is not really\nabout me but I plan to start doing\num if not mile repeats than doing some\nmile mile runs and testing there once a\nweek\nyou laid out a beautiful program for how\nto do that and then in the next episode\nyou\nwowed us again with a description of the\nscience and the tools and this right\ndown to the details but all laid out\nvery cleanly and clearly as to how to\ndesign an optimal fitness program what\nare the things that really represent an\noptimal program what questions does one\nhave to answer before designing a\nprogram what are some of the barriers in\nthe way this concept of Defenders as\nthings that prevent you from reaching\nyour goals and one of the key things I\nhave it right here in front of me that I\ntook away from that episode is was this\nquadrant\napproach of really thinking about and\nfiguring out how much one intends to\ndevote to work career calling let's make\nthat one bin relationships\nanother been Fitness in the other bin\nand Recovery in the other bin and um\nhere we'll tip our hat to our good\nfriend Kenny Kane\num for\num mentioning that overall\num scheme for doing things it's been\nimmensely useful and I've actually\ncharted it out and thought about and\ndrawn out which Different Things fall\ninto each of these categories you might\nthink it's obvious okay relationships\nbut that includes a lot of different\nthings and there's crossover between\nthese bins\num in terms of how you can combine\nenhancing relationships with Fitness\nwork recovery and so on so that episode\nis just again a treasure Trove of\nknowledge and then in the next episode\nyou you educated us on recovery in all\nits forms in the very short term in\nwithin the workout immediately after the\nworkout and from workout to workout ways\nto really accelerate recovery assess\nrecovery and as you pointed out for\npeople like me who always assume that we\ndon't recover very well and that some\nsort of character trait or nervous\nsystem thing or genetic to really think\nabout how my training is impacting my\nlevel of recovery and in doing so is\nrevealed to me that I have far more\ncapacity than I thought I had and\nalready this week I've managed to train\nmore often\ndoing more work and I feel better than\never\num and that's also despite the fact that\nwe've spent a fair amount of time in\nthese chairs across from one another\nit's a kind way to say it well it's it's\nbeen it's been a pleasure and then in\ntoday's episode you explained nutrition\nand supplementation as it relates to\nPerformance and of course that touches\ninto recovery but also optimal mental\nStates for training how to approach\none's training and how to extract the\nmost from training through quality\nnutrition right so what to eat and when\nwhich carbohydrates protein amounts\nWindows of opportunity Windows you\nabsolutely don't want to miss and then\nsome that are a bit more flexible and\nthen we went\ndeep into the weeds of magnesium garlic\ntart cherry extract Alpha GPC we touched\non neural transmitter related systems\nhormone-related systems\nwe went deep into a discussion about\nsleep because of course sleep is the\nfoundation for recovery and performance\nof all kinds emotional mental and\nphysical recovery and performance\nand in taking us through this enormous\nArc of a journey through Fitness\nI think it's fair to say that you've\ngiven us your knowledge contained in\nyour head I was telling someone just the\nother day that one of the things that I\nalways lamented in science is that I\nwould encounter these incredible\nprofessors and scientists and in other\ndomains of life too and you just wish\nthere was some way to download their\nbrain because they had so much knowledge\ninside them and um I'm looking for a USB\nor USBC port on you and I don't see one\nyet but what you've effectively done for\nus across these six episodes is to\ndownload the actionable knowledge and\nyou know it's wonderful the information\nyou've provided is clear\nit's super interesting it's highly\nhighly actionable and in many cases it's\ncounterintuitive and surprising but once\none understands the logic behind it as\nyou've provided for us also then it all\nmakes sense in a way that's extremely\nsatisfying and extremely motivating so\nit's certainly motivating me to change\nthe way that I train in a number of ways\nand I promise that I'll report back to\nour audience and to you as to what my\nresults are but really\nas we both agree this is not about me\nthis is not about you this is really\nabout the people listening and so for\nthose of you listening I hope you can\nappreciate what an Incredible Gift it is\nto have somebody of Dr Andy galpin's\nexperience and\num drive and uh scholarly background who\nalso works with athletes and everyday\npeople just to splay out all this\nknowledge for us systematically over six\nepisodes\nDr Andy Galpin thank you ever so much I\nappreciate that far too kind of uh words\nto me there if you've been following\nalong through this entire Journey as you\ncalled it you know I like first\nprinciples thinking and I like lists so\nI'm gonna get you with one more list and\nI got five things on this final list get\nyour pen and Pat out please number one I\nwant to really emphasize\nscience itself is a verb which means\nit's ongoing and changing I I did my\nbest\nover the course of these many many many\nhours to provide my interpretation of\nthe science\nto provide my practical knowledge and\nthings that I use but that's fallible\nscience changes there are many many\nthings in my career that I was very sure\nthe uh that the evidence was clear on\nand then it changed so as you move\nforward do not think of any of the\nrecommendations I gave you whether they\nwere about supplement dosages and timing\nrep ranges or breathing tactics anything\nin between\njust use them as guidelines so\nnumber one science is a verb\nnumber two\nI really want to thank the audience this\nhas been an extremely long haul as some\nof you have somehow I'm sure which I'm\nnot sure how but some of you have\nprobably made it through this entire\njourney and listened to all six episodes\nand you should probably get some sort of\nfree huberman lab shirt or something or\na plaque or I don't know how about a\ngalp in plaque ah I got from black how\nabout a internet high five and even if\nyou just dropped in for a few of the\nepisodes uh you know I appreciate you\ntaking the time there's a lot of things\nyou could be doing with your time and to\nmake to spend those resources on my\nwords is touching\nnumber three\nuh I want to actually thank you of\ncourse Andrew and the whole team and the\ncrew up here for three things number one\num I think it's incredibly important\nthat you have gone out of your way to\ngive other people credit for their work\nyou go out of your way on your large\nplatforms and social media to tag people\nto give scientists credit for their work\nand most people do not do that and\nthat's something you don't have to do\nand I think that is a culture you know I\nknow why you do it you come from science\nthat's just what you do you give people\ncredit for their work but you go out of\nyour way to do that and so I want to\nthank you for that\nthe next one is\nmany people who have\noutlets and platforms will try to fill\nthose with people who are going to grow\ntheir platforms it doesn't mean these\npeople are wrong or bad but I think\nwhat's extremely special about what\nyou've created here is again you have\ngone out of your way to bring on the\ndirect source of information I can't\neven imagine how many of your podcasts\nguests have never been on a podcast\nbefore\nor have been on a very short number of\nthem and you've made an extremely large\nplatform doing nothing but talking about\nsuper deep dork science directly from\nthe scientists themselves and to create\na community like that it's\num I'm so happy that science is is made\nit here and you've shown the world\num people aren't stupid people want\ndetail and people want science and\nyou've given it them\num\nthe last one of course let's see if I\nget through this is uh\nthank you for what you've done for me in\nmy career I\nunderstand there could have been any\nnumber of people in this chair\nto put me on your platform once was\num incredibly gracious\nbut to do it for 600 hours or whatever\nwe did in this series is uh\num I can't thank you enough for that\nopportunity so I hope I lived up to it\nand I had a tremendous time and then\nthank you for being such a gracious host\nwell you more than exceeded uh\nexpectations you are absolutely the\nperson to be in this chair talking about\nthese topics\nwith me and for the world\nand\nlike once again I just want to say thank\nyou\nas a colleague as a public educator as\nan exercise scientist and as a friend\nif you're learning from and or enjoying\nthis podcast please subscribe to our\nYouTube channel that's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us in addition\nplease
