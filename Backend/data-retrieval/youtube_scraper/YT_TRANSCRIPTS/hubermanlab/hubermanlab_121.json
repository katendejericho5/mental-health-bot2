    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are\ndiscussing breathing.\nNow, breathing is\nsomething that we are all\nfamiliar with because, frankly,\nwe are all doing it right now.\nAnd we do it during our waking\nstates and while we are asleep.\nAnd most of us have probably\nheard that breathing\nis essential to life.\nWe hear that we can survive\nwithout food for some period\nof time, maybe even\nup to a month or more,\nthat we can't survive\nthat long without water,\nbut we could survive a\nfew days without water,\ndepending on how well hydrated\nwe are when we go into that\nwater deprivation and the heat\nof the environment we happen\nto be in, but that we cannot\nsurvive without breathing\nfor more than a few minutes and\nthat if we cease to breathe,\nthat our brain and our\nbodily tissues will die.\nAnd, in fact, that is true.\nHowever, despite\neverybody's knowledge\nthat breathing is\nessential to life,\nI don't think that\nmost people realize\njust how important\nhow we breathe\nis to our quality of life.\nAnd that includes our mental\nhealth, our physical health,\nand what we call\nperformance, that\nis, our ability to\ntap into skills,\neither physical or cognitive,\nin ways that we would not\nbe able to otherwise if we\nare not breathing correctly.\nSo today, we are going\nto talk about what\nit is to breathe correctly, both\nat rest, during sleep, in order\nto reduce our levels of\nstress, in order to wake up\nor to become more\nalert deliberately,\nand many, many other\nthings, including\nhow to stop hiccuping.\nThis is one of the most searched\nfor topics on the internet.\nToday, I will teach\nyou the one method that\nis actually linked to science.\nNo, it does not involve\ndrinking a glass of water\nbackwards from the\nopposite side of the cup\nor holding your breath in\nany kind of esoteric way.\nIt actually relates to the\nneural mechanisms, that is,\nthe brain to body connections\nthat cause the hiccup.\nHiccup is a spasm of\nthat neural circuit,\nand I'll teach you how to turn\noff that neural circuit in one\ntry.\nAnd that's not a\ntechnique I developed.\nIt's a technique that's\nactually been known\nabout for several centuries.\nAnd we now know the\nunderlying mechanism.\nSo today's discussion\nwill give to you\nmany tools that you can apply.\nAll of these tools are, of\ncourse, behavioral tools.\nThey're completely zero cost.\nAnd in telling you\nhow those tools work,\nyou'll learn a lot about\nhow the breathing, a.k.a.\nthe respiratory, system,\nworks and how it interfaces\nwith the other organs\nand tissues of the body,\nin particular the brain.\nIn fact, one of the\nmost important things\nto understand about breathing\nright here at the outset\nis that breathing is unique\namong brain and bodily\nfunctions in that it lies at the\ninterface between our conscious\nand our subconscious behavior.\nAnd it represents\na bridge literally\nin the brain between the\nconscious and the subconscious.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, breathing does not\nrequire that we pay attention\nto our breathing\nor that we are even\naware that we are breathing.\nIt will just carry on in the\nbackground either normally\nor abnormally,\nand I'll teach you\nwhat normal and abnormal\nbreathing is in a little bit.\nHowever, breathing is unique\namong brain and bodily\nfunctions in that at any\nmoment, we can consciously\ntake control of how we breathe.\nThis is an absolutely\nspectacular and highly unusual\nfeature of brain function.\nFor instance, your\ndigestion is carrying on\nin the background right\nnow whether or not\nyou've had food recently or not.\nBut you can't simply\ncontrol your digestion\nby thinking about it\nin a particular way.\nIn fact, most people can't\neven control their thinking\nby trying to control\ntheir thinking.\nThat actually takes\nsome practice.\nIt can be done-- a topic\nfor a future episode.\nHowever, breathing is unique.\nBreathing will carry on\ninvoluntarily, subconsciously\nin the background,\nas I said before.\nBut if, at any moment, you want\nto hold your breath or inhale\nmore deeply or vigorously or\nexhale longer than you inhale,\nyou can do that.\nVery few, if any, other neural\ncircuits in your brain and body\nallow that level of control.\nAnd it turns out that level\nof control is not an accident.\nIt has been hypothesized that\nby controlling breathing,\nthe brain is actually\nattempting to control\nits own state of mind.\nNow, the way this was originally\nstated in a scientific research\npaper was a little\nbit different.\nIt was a little\nbit physiological.\nThe statement was, \"The brain,\nby regulating breathing,\ncontrols its own excitability.\"\nExcitability in the\ncontext of neurobiology\nis how able the brain is to\ntake in new information or not,\nhow able the brain is or not to\nturn itself off to go to sleep\nand to regulate its own levels\nof anxiety, focus, et cetera.\nIf that seems a\nlittle bit abstract,\nI'll make it simple for you.\nBy changing your\npattern of breathing,\nyou can very quickly change what\nyour brain is capable of doing.\nIn fact, a little\nbit later, I'll\ntell you that while\nyou inhale, you\nare far better at learning\nand remembering information\nthan during an exhale.\nAnd it is a very\nsignificant difference.\nDoes that mean you should\nonly inhale and not exhale?\nNo, of course not.\nI'll teach you how to breathe\nfor the sake of learning\nand memory as well as\nfor physical performance\nand a number of other things.\nSo hopefully I've been\nable to highlight for you\nthe importance of breathing\nnot just for life,\nbecause, yes, breathing\nis essential for life,\nbut that the subtleties\nof how we breathe,\nthe duration and\nintensity of our inhales\nand our exhales, how long we\nhold our breath between inhales\nand exhales, very critically\ndefines our state of mind\nand our state of body,\nwhat we are able to do\nand what we are not able to do.\nAnd the great news is we\ncan control our breathing\nand, in doing so, control\nour mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is HVMN.\nHVMN, which is a supplement\nthat increases ketones,\ncan be used in the context\nof a ketogenic diet.\nHowever, many people,\nincluding myself,\nfind that increasing\nblood ketones\nby using a supplement\nsuch as HVMN\ncan greatly improve cognitive\nability and physical output\nfor mental work and\nfor exercise even\nwhen not on a ketogenic diet.\nThere's a lot of research\nsupporting the fact\nthat even if you are\nconsuming carbohydrates\nand you are not in ketosis,\nthat is, you are not following\na ketogenic diet, consuming\nsupplements that can increase\nblood ketones can\nallow you to think more\nclearly for cognitive work, and\nphysical work, for that matter,\nperform at greater output for\nthings like resistance training\nand endurance exercise.\nAnd, indeed, that's\nwhat I've found.\nSo I use it largely\nfor preparing\nfor podcasts or other\naspects of my scientific work\nand sometimes prior to\nworkouts, especially\nif I'm working out having\nnot consumed any food prior.\nI find that I have\na lot more energy.\nIt also has the property\nof suppressing hunger.\nIf you'd like to try Ketone-IQ,\nyou can go to HVMN.com/Huberman\nto save 20%.\nAgain, that's HVMN.com/Huberman\nto save 20% off your order\nof Ketone-IQ.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd as many of you have\nprobably heard me say before,\nI am not a fan of\nthe word nootropics\nbecause nootropics\nmeans smart drugs.\nAnd, frankly, the brain\ndoesn't work that way.\nThe brain has neural\ncircuits for focus.\nIt also has neural circuits\nfor creativity and neural\ncircuits for task switching and\nfor imagination and for memory.\nThere is no such thing as a\nneural circuit for being smart.\nAnd therefore, the\nword nootropics\ndoesn't really apply to anything\nspecific neurobiologically\nspeaking.\nThesis understands\nthis and therefore has\ndesigned custom\nnootropics that are\ntailored to your unique needs.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor over a year now,\nand their nootropic\nformulas have\nbeen a game changer\nfor me, in particular\nin the realm of cognitive work.\nMy go-to formula\nfor when I'm doing\nany kind of cognitive work\nis their Clarity formula.\nThat's the one I've been\nusing most often lately.\nIf you'd like to try Thesis\ncustomized nootropics,\nyou can go online to\nTakeThesis.com/Huberman.\nYou'll take a brief\nthree-minute quiz.\nAnd Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first

device\nthat tracks your daily\nactivity and your sleep\nbut goes beyond that by\nproviding real-time feedback\non how to adjust your\ntraining and sleep\nschedule to perform better.\nI've been working with WHOOP\non their scientific advisory\ncouncil to help WHOOP\nevolve their mission\nto improve the way that\npeople are sleeping\nand thereby to improve\ntheir levels of focus, mood,\nand alertness and performance\nin all endeavors during the day.\nAs a WHOOP user,\nI've experienced\nthe health benefits, the focus\nbenefits, essentially all\nof the major benefits\nthat come with getting\nan excellent night's sleep\non a consistent basis.\nI've also learned from\nusing my WHOOP how\ncertain daily activities,\nlike the timing of exercise,\ncaffeine, and a number\nof other things,\nimpact the depth, quality,\nand duration of my sleep.\nWHOOP is one of those\ntools that can really\nhelp guide you and provide\nyou with personalized data,\nrecommendations, and\ncoaching around your body\nand your overall health.\nSo it's not just\nabout tracking sleep.\nIt's about tracking all\naspects of your activity\nand health and, of\ncourse, including sleep.\nIf you're interested\nin trying WHOOP,\nyou can go to\nJoin.WHOOP.com/Huberman today\nand get your first month free.\nLet's talk about breathing.\nAnd, of course, we\nbreathe in order\nto bring oxygen into the body.\nBut we also breathe to remove\ncertain things from our body,\nin particular carbon dioxide.\nSo the main players\nin today's discussion\nare going to be oxygen\nand carbon dioxide.\nNow, a common misconception\nis that oxygen is good\nand carbon dioxide is bad.\nThat's simply not the case.\nLet's just take a step\nback from that statement,\nand let's think about this.\nWhen we breathe\nin, we are largely\nbreathing in air in order to\nbring oxygen into our body.\nAnd we can just stop\nright there and say,\nwhy do we breathe at all?\nWhy can't we just get oxygen\nfrom the world around us?\nWell, it's because oxygen\ncan't diffuse through our skin\ninto the deeper\ncells of our body.\nOther single cell and\nvery simple organisms\ncan actually bring\noxygen into their system\nwithout the need to breathe.\nBut we have to breathe\nin order to bring oxygen\nto the cells that\nreside deep in our body.\nIn particular, our\nbrain cells, which\nare the most metabolically\nactive cells in our body,\nrequire a lot of oxygen.\nAnd those brain cells\nare sitting, of course,\nin the brain, which\nis encased in the\ncranial vault, the skull.\nAnd so oxygen can't simply\npass to those cells.\nSo we need to have a system\nthat will deliver oxygen\nto those cells.\nWe also need a system,\nwhich turns out\nto be the breathing or\nrespiratory system, that\ncan offload or remove the\ngas that we call carbon\ndioxide, not because\ncarbon dioxide is bad\nbut because too much of it\nin our system is not good.\nIn fact, much of\ntoday's discussion\nwill also center around\nthe common misconception\nthat carbon dioxide is something\nthat we want to get rid of.\nYou don't want to get rid of\ntoo much carbon dioxide or else\nyou can't actually get oxygen\nto the cells and tissues\nof your body in\nan efficient way.\nSo you need oxygen and you need\ncarbon dioxide in your body.\nYou also need to be able\nto offload or remove\ncarbon dioxide and bring in\noxygen in the correct ratios\nso that you can perform the\nkind of mental functions\nand physical functions\nthat you want to.\nSo if we just dial\nout even further,\nwe say, what are the key\ncomponents of breathing?\nWhat are the elements\nwithin the body that\nallow us to bring oxygen\nto the tissues and cells\nas is required and remove\ncarbon dioxide from the body\nas is required and yet keep\nenough carbon dioxide around\nin order to allow\noxygen to do its thing?\nWell, that breathing or\nrespiratory apparatus\nhas two major\ncomponents, and I'm\ngoing to just briefly\ndescribe those.\nAnd as I do this, I really\nwant to highlight the fact\nthat any time you're thinking\nabout biology and physiology\nin particular, whether or\nnot it's about the brain\nor the liver or\nthe gut microbiome,\nit's useful to categorize things\neither as mechanical mechanisms\nor chemical mechanisms.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, let's just take\nthe analogy of hunger.\nThere are mechanical\nmechanisms that\ntell us when we should eat.\nFor instance, you have neurons,\nnerve cells in your gut\nthat signal how\nstretched or nonstretched\nthe walls of your\nstomach are, how full\nor how empty your gut is,\nand send that information\nto the brain to make you feel\nto some extent hungry or not\nhungry.\nIn general, when our\nstomach is very full\nand especially if it's very\ndistended, even with liquid,\nit suppresses our hunger.\nWhereas when our stomach is\ndevoid of that mechanical\npressure, especially\nfor a number of hours,\nit tends to trigger\nhunger by signaling\nvia neurons to the brain.\nIn addition, there are chemical\nsignals that go from the gut\nto the brain.\nFor instance, we have\nneurons in our gut\nthat can detect the\npresence of amino acids\nfrom proteins that we eat,\nfatty acids from the foods\nthat we eat, the lipids,\nand sugars, different forms\nof carbohydrate.\nThe neurons in our gut\nare paying attention to\nor respond to how much\namino acid, fatty acid,\nand carbohydrate is in\nour gut and sends signals\nto the brain to either\nstimulate or suppress hunger.\nSo those are\nchemical signals that\nare being passed\nfrom gut to brain,\nand they work in parallel\nwith the mechanical signals.\nAnd this idea of\n\"in parallel with,\"\nagain, is a very common\ntheme in biology,\nespecially neuroscience.\nThe term parallel pathways\nrefers to the fact\nthat any time there's a\ncritical bodily function,\nit's very unlikely that just\none type of information,\nlike just mechanical\ninformation,\nis going to be used.\n/ Almost always,\nit's going to be mechanical\nand chemical information.\nI could pick a number\nof other examples.\nFor instance, if\nyou want to avoid\ndamaging your skin or other\ntissues of your body, which\nis essential to life, well, then\nyou have mechanical information\nabout, for instance,\nwhether or not something\nis pinching or ready\nto pierce your skin.\nThat's mechanical information.\nIt's sent via specific\nneurons up to the brain\nto signal a retraction\nreflex if you\nmove your limb away from\nwherever that intense pressure\nis coming.\nYou also have chemical\nsensing in your skin,\nthe presence of things\nthat elicit a burn\nor that elicit itch or\nthat elicit extreme cold.\nAll of that chemical\ninformation is\nbeing signaled up to the\nbrain as well in parallel.\nSo parallel pathways\nis a common theme.\nSo when we're thinking about\nthe respiration, a.k.a.\nthe breathing,\nsystem, we also need\nto look at the\nmechanical system.\nWhat are the\ndifferent components\nof the nose, the mouth,\nthe lungs, et cetera, that\nallow oxygen to be\nbrought in and carbon\ndioxide to be removed from the\nbody but not too much carbon\ndioxide removed\nto allow breathing\nto work as efficiently and\nas optimally as possible?\nAnd then we also need to\nlook at the chemical systems\nof the lungs, the bloodstream,\nand how different cells use\noxygen and carbon\ndioxide in order\nto understand that as well.\nIf you can understand the\nmechanical and chemical aspects\nof breathing, even\njust at a top contour,\nwell, then the\nvarious tools that I\ndiscuss during today's\nepisode, such as the ability\nto calm yourself down most\nquickly by doing what's\ncalled a physiological sigh--\nI'll go into this in more\ndetail in a little bit,\nbut this is two very deep\ninhales through the nose.\nSo the first one is a long\ninhale [INHALES DEEPLY],,\nand then the second one after\nthat is [INHALES SHARPLY]\na quick, sharp inhale to\nmaximally inflate your lungs,\nfollowed by a full exhale\nthrough the mouth to lungs\ncompletely empty.\nSo it's big inhale\nthrough the nose,\nthen short inhale\nthrough the nose\nimmediately after that in order\nto maximally inflate the lungs,\nand then a long exhale\nthrough the mouth\nuntil your lungs are empty.\nYou will understand why that\nparticular pattern of breathing\nand not simply one\ninhale or not simply\nan inhale through the nose\nand an exhale through the nose\nas well is optimal for\nreducing your stress quickly.\nThat double inhale through the\nnose followed by a long exhale\nthrough the mouth works to\nreduce your levels of stress\nand lower your levels of\nso-called autonomic arousal\nvery fast in real time.\nAnd it works better than\nany other known approach.\nIt's not a hack.\nThis is actually something\nthat your body has\nspecific neural circuits\nto do, and it actually\nperforms during sleep on\na regular basis and even\nthroughout the day, and that\nyou can perform voluntarily.\nAnd it works so well\nto reduce stress\nvery quickly not\nbecause it brings\nin the maximum amount\nof oxygen and removes\nthe maximum amount of\ncarbon dioxide but,\nrather, because it optimally\nbalances oxygen and carbon\ndioxide.\nIf you understand the\nmechanical and chemical aspects\nof breathing, then you\nwill understand exactly why\nthat particular\npattern of breathing,\nthe so-called\nphysiological sigh,\nis the most efficient\nway to rapidly reduce\nstress in real time.\nIf you can understand the\nmechanical and chemical aspects\nof breathing, you will\nalso understand why\nmost people are overbreathing.\nThat is, they're breathing\ntoo often, even if they're\nbreathing in a shallow manner.\nThey're breathing too often.\nAnd they are blowing off\nor removing too much carbon\ndioxide.\nAnd if you understand\nthat carbon dioxide is\ncritical for the way\nthat oxygen is delivered\nfrom the bloodstream to\nthe tissues of the body,\nincluding the\nbrain, well, then it\nwill make very good\nsense as to why\npeople who are\nbreathing too much\ndon't actually experience all\nthe effects of elevated oxygen,\nbut, rather, they're putting\ntheir body into what's\ncalled a hypoxic state.\nThey're not getting\nenough oxygen\nto the tissues of their body,\nin particular their brain.\nAnd this is true not just\nfor people who are obese\nor who suffer from sleep apnea,\nalthough that's certainly\nthe case, but for people\nthat have, believe it or not,\ncertain personality types.\nWe'll talk about breathing\nand personality type\nand actually how\nbreathing has been\nshown to alter personality.\nThat's right.\nBreathing can alter personality\nin positive ways that\nallow anyone to show up to the\nvarious social and nonsocial\nendeavors of their life\nwith more calm, more focus,\nalertness, and improve\ntheir overall health.\nOK, so let's talk about\nthe mechanical components\nof breathing.\nIt's really quite simple.\nYou've got your nose, obviously,\nand you've got your mouth.\nAnd a little bit\nlater, we'll talk\nabout the incredible advantages\nof being a nasal breather\nmost of the time but also\nthe incredible advantages\nof using your mouth to breathe\nboth for inhales and exhales\nduring particular\ntypes of endeavors.\nAnd we'll get back to\nthat a little later.\nBut for the meantime,\nthe only two ways\nto bring air into your\nsystem are through your nose\nand through your mouth.\nWe also have the larynx, which\nis a rigid tissue or pipe that\nbrings the air from the nose\nand mouth down to the lungs.\nNow, that word rigid is\nreally important here\nbecause what we will soon learn\nis that your lungs basically\nact like a pump.\nYou sort of know this already.\nBut these are two\nbig bags basically\nthat can fill with air or\nthat can squeeze air out.\nNow, what most\npeople don't realize\nis that the lungs are not\njust too big bags of air.\nYour lungs are actually too big\nbags of air that inside of them\nhave hundreds of\nmillions of little sacs\nthat are called the\nalveoli of the lungs.\nAnd by having those hundreds\nof millions of little sacs,\nyou increase the surface\narea of the lungs.\nAnd by increasing\nthe surface area,\nyou allow more oxygen to pass\nfrom the air in your lungs\ninto the bloodstream than if\nyou didn't have those sacs.\nAnd you allow more\ncarbon dioxide\nto move from the bloodstream\ninto those sacs of the lungs,\nand then when you exhale, the\ncarbon dioxide can be removed.\nSo those little sacs we\ncall alveoli of the lungs\nare an important part\nof the mechanical aspect\nof breathing we'll get\nto a little bit later.\nSo at a first pass, the\nmechanical aspects of breathing\nare really straightforward.\nYou can breathe\nthrough your nose.\nYou can through your mouth.\nIt goes down through the larynx.\nI told you the larynx\nis a rigid pipe.\nThe lungs are not rigid.\nThey can expand and\nthey can contract\nlike a pump to bring\nin air or to expel air.\nKeep in mind that\nthe lungs do not\nhave any muscles themselves.\nSo we need muscles that can\neither squeeze the lungs\nor that will allow\nthe lungs to expand.\nAnd there are two general\ngroups of muscles that do that,\nand they are the diaphragm\nand the so-called intercostal\nmuscles.\nThe diaphragm is a thin muscle\nthat sits below the lungs\nand above the liver.\nAnd when we inhale,\nprovided that we\nare using what's called\ndiaphragmatic breathing, that\ndiaphragm contracts.\nAnd when it contracts,\nit moves down,\nwhich allows more space for\nthe lungs to inflate with air.\nNow, the intercostal muscles are\nthe muscles between our ribs.\nA number of people probably\ndon't realize this.\nBut your ribs, of\ncourse, are bone,\nbut in between those\nbones, you have muscles.\nAnd the intercostal\nmuscles, when you inhale,\ncontract, and that allows\nyour rib cage to move up\nand to expand a bit.\nAnd I think, again,\npeople probably\ndon't realize that your\nribs are not fixed in place.\nThey can actually get\nfurther and closer apart\nfrom one another.\nSo when you inhale, your\nrib cage actually moves up.\nSometimes the shoulders\nwill move up as well.\nAnd that's because those\nintercostal muscles\nare contracting.\nNow, muscles can't\nmove on their own.\nThey are controlled by nerves.\nSo we've got the nose,\nthe mouth, the larynx,\nand the lungs.\nThe lungs have all those\nlittle alveoli in them.\nAnd as I told you,\nwe've got the diaphragm\nas a muscle to move\nthe lungs, and we\nhave the intercostal muscles\nto move the ribs, which\ncan allow the lungs to expand.\nAgain, we're just on the\nmechanical components\nof breathing.\nBut because muscles\ncan't move themselves,\nyou should be asking,\nwhat moves the muscles?\nAnd it's really nerves\nthat control muscles.\nSo whether or not you're\ncontracting your biceps\nor you're walking and you're\ncontracting your quadriceps\nand your hamstrings\nand your calf muscles,\nit's neurons, nerve\ncells that control that.\nThere's a specialized nerve\ncalled the phrenic nerve,\nP-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve,\nthat comes out of the neck.\nAnd when I say it comes out\nof the neck, what I mean\nis that there are little neurons\nthat reside in the brainstem,\nin the back of your brain,\nand they send little wires\nthat we call axons down\nand out of the neck.\nThey go close to the heart\nand a little bit behind it.\nAnd they go down, and\nthey form synapses.\nThat is, they form connections\nwith the diaphragm.\nAnd when those neurons release\nneurotransmitters, which\nare little chemicals,\nthe diaphragm contracts,\nand it moves down.\nSo we say that the phrenic\nnerve is a motor nerve.\nIt's designed to move muscle.\nHowever, the phrenic nerve, like\na few other nerves in the body,\nis interesting in that it has\nnot just motor nerves in there,\nneurons that control the\ncontraction of muscles.\nIt also can sense things,\nhas sensory neurons.\nSo it also sends connections\ndown to the diaphragm\nand actually down deep\ninto the diaphragm\nand close to the liver.\nAnd note that I said\nliver twice now already,\nand we're going to\nget back to this later\nwhen we talk about\nphysical movement\nand cramps of the body.\nThose sensory neurons dive\ndeep into the diaphragm.\nAnd then they go\nback up to the brain,\nand they allow you to sense\nwhere the diaphragm is.\nSo they're giving\ninformation about where\nthe diaphragm is in your body.\nNow, most of the time, you're\nnot paying attention to this.\nBut right now, you\ncan actually try this.\nAnd I would encourage\nyou to do this.\nDiaphragmatic breathing\nis, in many ways,\nthe ideal way to breathe and\nthat it's the most efficient\nway to breathe.\nWe'll talk about what\nwe mean exactly when we\nsay breathing efficiency later.\nBut the diaphragm\nis designed to allow\nthe lungs to expand or\nto contract the lungs,\nto bring air into\nthe body or to remove\ncarbon dioxide from the body.\nAnd if you want to\nknow whether or not\nyou're using diaphragmatic\nbreathing, it's very simple.\nIf you inhale-- probably best\nto do this through the nose,\nbut you could do it\nthrough the mouth.\nIf you inhale and your belly\nmoves outward on the inhale,\nwell, then that phrenic nerve\nis controlling your diaphragm\nproperly.\nAnd then when you\nexhale, your belly\nshould go in just a little bit.\nThat's diaphragmatic breathing.\nNow, diaphragmatic\nbreathing is talked\nabout in the context of yoga.\nIt's often talked about as a\nway to calm down and so on.\nBut diaphragmatic\nbreathing is just one mode\nby which your brain\nand the phrenic nerve\ncan control muscle,\nthe diaphragm,\nto control the mechanical\naspects of the lungs\nto bring in air and expel air.\nAs I mentioned\nbefore, you also have\nthese muscles between your ribs\nor the intercostal muscles.\nAnd there's a\nseparate set of nerves\nthat allow those muscles to\ncontract and for your rib cage\nto expand in order to create\nmore room for your lungs\nto get larger and fill with\nair or for your rib cage\nto contract a bit when\nthose muscles relax in order\nto expel air.\nI'd like to go on\nrecord by saying\nthat there is no rule that\ndiaphragmatic breathing is\nbetter than breathing\nwhere your rib cage moves.\nThis is a common misconception.\nPeople say, oh, if your\nshoulders are going up and down\nand your rib cage is moving\nwhile you're breathing,\nwell, then you're\nnot breathing right.\nAnd if your belly goes out\nand the rest of your body\nis still while you\nbreathe, well, then you're\nbreathing correctly.\nI know of zero--\nin fact, zero minus one data\nto support that statement.\nYou have multiple\nparallel mechanisms\nto control the mechanics of\nyour lungs and for breathing.\nAnd when you're exerting\nyourself very hard,\nyou tend to use both\nthe intercostal muscles\nand your rib cage moving as\nwell as your diaphragm in order\nto bring in a lot of\noxygen and to offload\na lot of carbon dioxide.\nAnd when you're\ncalmer, frankly, you\ncould use\ndiaphragmatic breathing\nor you could use rib cage\ntype breathing in order\nto bring enough oxygen\ninto your system.\nThere's no real data showing\nthat diaphragmatic breathing is\nsomehow better or worse.\nHowever, being able to\nmechanically control those\nindependently or to combine\nthem and use them together\nis of tremendous power\ntoward regulating\nyour mental and physical states.\nAnd we'll talk about how to\ndo that a little bit later.\nFor right now, please\nunderstand that you\nhave these different\nmechanical components that\nallow you to bring oxygen into\nyour system and to expel air\nand to thereby offload carbon\ndioxide from your system.\nAgain, we haven't talked about\nthe gas exchange of carbon\ndioxide and oxygen\nand how that's\nhappening in the bloodstream.\nWe'll talk about that next.\nBut the basic mechanical\ncomponents are pretty simple.\nOnce again, just to review,\nit's nose, mouth, larynx, lungs,\nalveoli within the lungs,\nand then those two muscles,\nthe diaphragm and the\nintercostal muscles\nof the ribs.\nAnd one thing I\nfailed to mention\nis why it's so important that\nthat larynx be rigid, that it's\na tube that is very rigid.\nAnd the reason for that is\nthat unlike the lungs, which\nyou want to act as\nsort of a bellow pump\nwhere you can deflate it and\ninflate it in order to move air\nin and out, the larynx\nneeds to be rigid\nso that it doesn't collapse\nwhile you're bringing air\nin and out.\nYou can imagine that if it was\na very flimsy tube or the walls\nof the larynx were\nvery flimsy and thin,\nwell, then you can imagine\nbreathing in very vigorously,\nand it would shut\nlike a tube that\nsuddenly flattens on itself,\nwhich would not be good.\nSo the fact that\nthe larynx is rigid\nis actually a very crucial\npart of this whole system.\nThe other important\naspect of this system\nas it relates to the\nmechanics of breathing\nis the fact that your\nnose and your mouth\nhave different\nresistances to air.\nYou can probably\nnotice this right now\nif you were to, for\ninstance, breathe\nin through your mouth\n[INHALES] and only\nthrough your mouth\nversus breathing\nthrough your nose [SNIFFS].\nSome of you perhaps have\na harder time breathing in\nthrough your nose.\nBy the way, it's\nperfectly normal\nthat one or the\nother nostril would\nbe harder to breathe through\nor easier to breathe through\nand that switches\nacross the day.\nIt has to do with the flow\nof mucus and cerebrospinal\nfluid and intracranial pressure.\nTotally normal.\nMany people out\nthere think they have\na deviated septum\nwho don't actually\nhave a deviated septum.\nA little bit later,\nwe'll talk about how\nto repair a deviated septum\nwithout surgery because that\nactually is possible\nin many, not all, cases\nand is immensely\nbeneficial to do.\nBut what we know is that\nbreathing in through the nose\nis a little bit harder,\nand it's supposed\nto be a little bit harder.\nHowever, because it's a little\nbit harder because there's\nmore resistance, as we\nsay, you are actually\nable to draw more force into\nthese mechanical aspects\nof the breathing\napparatus and actually\nbring more air into your lungs.\nYou can try this right now.\nTry breathing in through your\nmouth to maximally inflate\nyour lungs and try and do it\nthrough mostly diaphragmatic\nbreathing, just for\nsake of example.\nIn other words, try and\nbreathe in through your mouth.\nAnd as you do that, have your\nbelly expand and maximally\ninflate your lungs.\nI'll do it right now with you\nso that we can do it together\nand I can prove to\neveryone that I'm just as\ndeficient in this as you are.\n[INHALES]\nOK, so I can inflate\nmy stomach doing that.\nBut now try doing\nit with your nose,\nand please do exhale before you\ntry doing it with your nose.\nWith your nose, you're going\nto feel more resistance,\nbut you'll notice that you can\ninflate it quite a bit further.\n[SNIFFS] And you'll feel your\nentire cavity, your belly\nand maybe even in your lower\nback, fill with some pressure.\nSo the increased\nresistance actually\nallows you to draw more\nair into the system.\nThis turns out to\nbe very important.\nAnd it also wipes away\na common misconception,\nwhich is if you're somebody\nwho has challenges breathing in\nthrough your nose, that somehow\nyou should avoid breathing in\nthrough your nose, actually,\nquite the opposite is true.\nAnd we can go a\nstep further and say\nthat if you have challenges\nbreathing in through your nose,\nchances are that's\nbecause the increased\nresistance of breathing\nin through your nose,\nprovided it's not\ncompletely occluded,\nis going to allow you to bring\nmore oxygen into your system.\nThis will turn out to\nbe useful later when\nwe explore different\ntechniques, for instance,\nnot just to calm down\nquickly but to elevate\nyour energy quickly, to remove\na cramp during exercise,\nand a number of other\nthings that breathing\ncan be used for that\ncan be immensely\nuseful for mental and\nphysical challenges.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreen since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nin the Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiota health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nAthleticGreens.com/Huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3/K2.\nAgain, that's\nAthleticGreens.com/Huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year's supply\nof vitamin D3/K2.\nSo now let's talk about the\nchemical aspects of breathing.\nAnd the two major players\nin this discussion\nare oxygen, which all the cells\nand tissues of your body need,\nand carbon dioxide,\nwhich all the cells\nand tissues of your body need.\nIn fact, carbon dioxide\nplays critical roles\nin delivering oxygen\nto your cells.\nAnd without carbon\ndioxide, you're\nnot going to get enough\noxygen to the cells\nand tissues of your body.\nThat said, if carbon\ndioxide levels are too high,\nthat is very problematic.\nIn fact, one of the ways that\none can reliably induce panic\nin anybody is to\nhave them breathe\nair that contains too\nmuch carbon dioxide,\nso much so that for\npeople that lack\na so-called\namygdala-- many of you\nhave probably heard\nof the amygdala.\nThis is a brain area that's\nassociated with fear and threat\ndetection.\nEven in people who\ncompletely lack amygdalas\non both sides of the brain\nbecause they were removed\nbecause they had\nepileptic seizures there\nand, therefore, those people are\ncompletely unafraid of things\nthat they ought to be\nafraid of like heights,\npoisonous snakes, any\nnumber of different things\ndangerous to humans,\nwell, if those people\nbreathe an excess amount\nof carbon dioxide,\nthey immediately\nhave a panic attack.\nWhat that tells us\nis that, again, there\nare parallel mechanisms,\nthere's redundancy in the system\nto protect ourselves from\nhaving too much carbon\ndioxide in our system.\nSo we need enough carbon dioxide\nand enough oxygen in our system\nbut not too much.\nThe way that's accomplished is,\nof course, we breathe in air.\nOur lungs inflate.\nAnd if you recall those\nlittle alveoli of the lungs,\nthose little sacs, oxygen can\nactually move from the air\ninto those little sacs and\nthen from those little sacs\ninto the vasculature--\nthe vasculature are\nthe capillaries, the veins,\nand the arteries of the body--\nbecause the walls of\nthose little alveoli\nare exceedingly thin, and they\nhave tons of little capillaries\nthat go into them and\nare all around them.\nSo this is amazing, right?\nThere's oxygen literally\npassing from inside\nof these little\nsacs in our lungs\nbecause we inhaled the\noxygen from the air\ninto the bloodstream,\nand then that oxygen\ngets bound up by\nproteins in the blood,\nin particular hemoglobin.\nAnd hemoglobin then\ndelivers oxygen\nto the various cells\nand tissues of the body.\nHowever, oxygen can't just\nhop on hemoglobin and cruise\nalong with hemoglobin until\nit gets to, say, your brain\nand then hop off.\nIt doesn't work that way.\nYou require carbon\ndioxide in order\nto liberate oxygen\nfrom hemoglobin.\nCarbon dioxide has this\nincredible property\nof actually being able to\nchange the shape of hemoglobin.\nHemoglobin is shaped as a\nsort of a cage around oxygen\nmolecules.\nAnd when it's in\nthat cage shape,\nthe oxygen can't be liberated.\nSo you've got oxygen and\nhemoglobin bound to one another\nmoving through your bloodstream.\nBut if a tissue\nneeds oxygen, there\nneeds to be carbon dioxide\npresent to open up that cage.\nAnd that's what\ncarbon dioxide does.\nIt allows that cage\nto change shape,\nand then the oxygen\ncan be liberated\nand then can be\ndelivered to the tissues,\nwhether or not that's brain\ntissue or muscle tissue,\nso on and so forth.\nAnd so those are the\nmajor chemical components\nof breathing.\nThere are a few\nother aspects related\nto the chemical\ncomponents of breathing,\nsuch as the fact that carbon\ndioxide is strongly related\nto how acidic or how basic\nyour body is in general.\nSo for instance, if carbon\ndioxide levels go way down,\nyour blood pH goes way up.\nThat is, you become\nmore alkaline.\nNow, for many people, the word\npH and the whole concept of pH\nimmediately starts to evoke\nanxiety in and of itself.\npH is actually very simple.\nYou want the body basically\nto be at a pH of about 7.4.\nThere are some\nregions of your body,\nin particular along the gut,\nfor which that number is\nimportantly different in order\nfor digestion to work properly.\nYou've all heard of the gut\nmicrobiome, the little microbes\nthat, provided you\nhave enough of them\nand they're diverse enough,\nallow your brain and body\nto function optimally at the\nlevel of immune system, hormone\nsystem, brain, et cetera.\nWell, in the gut, you\nwant the pH sometimes\nbe slightly more acidic.\nBecause when it's more\nacidic, the little microbiota\nflourish far more than\nif it were more basic.\nBut basically, you want\nthe rest of the body\nto be at about pH 7.4.\nIf carbon dioxide levels go to\nlow, the pH increases in a way\nthat you might say,\noh, well, that's bad,\nbut that actually\nallows more oxygen\nto be available to the\ntissues of your body, at least\ntemporarily.\nWe'll talk about this\na bit more later.\nIf I'm losing any of\nyou, just hang in there\nbecause we're almost done\nwith this whole business\nof the mechanics and the\nchemistry of breathing,\nand then we can get into the\ntools and revisit some of this\nlater to clean up any\nmisunderstandings that\nmay have arisen.\nBut as we're talking about\ncarbon dioxide over and over\nagain and how key it is to have\ncarbon dioxide and the problems\nwith it going too\nhigh to low, you\nshould probably be asking\nyourself, what actually makes\ncarbon dioxide go too low?\nWe know that we\nbreathe in oxygen,\nand then it can pass from\nthe lungs and the alveoli\ninto the bloodstream and that we\nneed carbon dioxide to liberate\noxygen from the\nhemoglobin into the cells\nand tissues of the body.\nAnd we know that\nwhen we exhale--\nwell, actually, I haven't\ntold you this yet.\nBut you should know\nthat when you exhale,\ncarbon dioxide is actually\ntaken from the bloodstream\nback into the\nalveoli of the lungs.\nAnd then when you exhale, it's\nexpelled through your mouth\nor through your nose\nout into the world.\nSo the way I just described all\nthat-- inhale, bring in oxygen,\nexhale, expel carbon dioxide--\npretty straightforward, right?\nIndeed, it is.\nAnd it also tells\nyou that were you\nto exhale a lot more or\na lot more vigorously,\nyou would expel\nmore carbon dioxide.\nAnd in fact, that's\nexactly the way it works.\nWhen you hyperventilate,\nof course, you\nare inhaling more than\nusual, but you are also\nexhaling more than usual.\nSo you're, of course, bringing\nin more air and oxygen\nto your body.\nBut you're also removing more\ncarbon dioxide from your body\nthan normal.\nCarbon dioxide, because of the\nways that it regulates brain\nstate-- in fact, the way\nin which it regulates\nthe excitability, literally\nthe ability of your neurons\nto engage electrically or not--\nit can create states of\npanic and anxiety, which\nis why when you\nhyperventilate, you\nfeel an increase\nin anxiety, or when\nyou feel an increase in\nanxiety, you hyperventilate.\nIt's a reciprocal relationship.\nIn fact, I don't want\nanyone who has anxiety\nor who has panic\nattacks to try this now.\nBut for most people,\nit's probably safe\nas long as you're not driving\nor doing something mechanical\nor operating machinery, that is.\nProbably safe to do 25 or\n30 deep inhales and exhales.\nAnd you'll notice that\nby about breath 10,\nyou'll start to feel\ntingly, and you'll probably\nfeel a little bit more alert.\nAnd, again, if you have anxiety\nor panic attack tendencies,\nplease don't do this.\nBut you will feel an increase\nin so-called autonomic arousal,\nan increase in the activity\nof your overall sympathetic\nnervous system, which has\nnothing to do with sympathy,\nhas everything to\ndo with alertness.\nYou'll actually deploy\nadrenaline from your adrenals.\nSo I'll just do this now.\nYou can try this now, again,\nprovided you're in a safe place\nand you don't have anxiety\nor panic attack tendencies.\nYou would just breathe\nin through your nose\nand out through your mouth.\nRemember, we're breathing\nin more and more vigorously,\nand we're exhaling more and\nmore vigorously than we normally\nwould.\nIt goes something like this.\n[INHALING, EXHALING]\nNow, by breath 8\nor 9 or 10, you'll\nnotice that your body\nstarts to heat up.\nThat's due to a\ncouple of things,\nmainly the release of\nadrenaline from your adrenals.\nI'm already feeling a\nlittle bit lightheaded.\nThe lightheadedness is actually\nbecause your vasculature,\nthe capillaries and veins\nand, to some extent,\neven the arteries of your body\nand particularly in your brain,\nare actually starting\nto constrict.\nSo you're cutting off\nblood flow to the brain.\nWhy?\nWell, because carbon dioxide\nactually is a vasodilator.\nNormally, it exists in your\nbody to keep capillaries, veins,\nand arteries dilated to allow\nblood to pass through them.\nWhen you hyperventilate,\nsure, you're\nbringing in a lot\nof oxygen, which\nyou think would make you more\nalert, and, indeed, it does.\nBut you are also expelling\na lot more carbon dioxide\nthan you normally would.\nAnd that's causing\nsome vasoconstriction,\nand you're going\nto start feeling\ntingly in the periphery,\nin your fingers and toes\nperhaps or your legs.\nYou will also notice that you're\nfeeling more alert in the brain\nbut that you might start\nto feel a bit of anxiety.\nSo hyperventilation, yes,\nbrings in more oxygen,\nalso removes more\ncarbon dioxide.\nThe removal of\nexcess carbon dioxide\nputs you into a state that's\ncalled hypocapnic, hypoxia.\nHypoxia is reduced levels of\noxygen relative to normal.\nHypocapnia is reduced\nlevels of carbon dioxide\nrelative to normal.\nAnd it is those reduced\nlevels of carbon dioxide\nthat are largely responsible\nfor that elevation\nin energy and at the same time\na feeling of a bit of anxiety,\nthe construction of\nthe microvasculature\nin the brain and\nbody, and therefore\nthe feelings of\nbeing kind of tingly\nand having kind of\nan urgency to move.\nOK, so by now, it\nshould be clear\nthat we need both oxygen\nand carbon dioxide.\nAnd across the course\nof this episode,\nI will explain how to adjust\nthose ratios of oxygen\nto carbon dioxide depending on\nwhat your immediate needs are\nand what you plan to\ndo next, whether or not\nthat's sleep or exercise\nor mental work, et cetera.\nBefore going any\nfurther, however, there\nis something I want to touch on.\nBecause even though not\neveryone will experience this,\nI think enough\npeople experience it\nthat it is of\ninterest, and now's\nthe right time to touch into\nwhat happens when you go up\nto a very high altitude, meaning\nwhy it's hard to breathe when\nyou get up to high altitudes.\nSo if you're close\nto sea level, you\nare getting out of the\noptimal balance of oxygen\nin the air you breathe.\nAs you ascend in\naltitude-- so let's\nsay you go to 6,000\nfeet or 10,000\nor maybe even 11,000\nfeet above sea level.\nOr maybe you're one of\nthose rare individuals that\nclimbs Denali, or you\nclimb Mount Everest,\nand you get up there, and you\nnotice that most people are\ngoing to wear an oxygen mask.\nWhy is it that you need an\noxygen mask at those very high\naltitudes or when people\ndo these very high altitude\nskydives that they need\noxygen way up high?\nWell, a lot of people will say,\noh, there's not much oxygen\nup there.\nThe air is thinner.\nOK, well, perhaps a better\nway to think about it\nis that, remember\nwhen we were talking\nabout the mechanical aspects\nof breathing and the fact\nthat the lungs don't\nreally move themselves,\nthat they have the\nmuscles, the diaphragm\nand the intercostal\nmuscles to move them?\nWell, a lot of the reason why\nyour lungs can fill so readily\nwith air is that when you don't\nhave much air in your lungs,\nthere's very low air pressure in\nyour lungs relative to outside\nyou.\nSo what we mean\nthen is if you were\nto open up your mouth\n[INHALES] or your nose\nand breathe in, that is,\nbreathe in through your nose\nor mouth, what's\ngoing to happen is\nair is going to move from\nhigh pressure to low pressure.\nSo it's very easy\nto fill your lungs.\nEven though you\nneed those muscles\nto move the various\nthings around that\nallow your lungs\nto fill, the air\nis going to go from high\npressure to low pressure.\nSo [INHALES] for those\nof you listening,\nI just took a big\ninhale through my nose.\nAnd then when you exhale, you're\nbasically taking the lungs\nfrom a state in\nwhich the pressure is\nreally high in the\nlungs, high pressure,\nlike a balloon that's full--\nand the pressure in your\nlungs when your lungs are full\nis higher than the air outside.\nSo it's pretty easy\n[EXHALES] to expel that air\nthrough the nose or mouth.\nWhen you're at high altitudes,\nthe air pressure is lower.\nAnd so what happens is when\nthe air pressure is lower\noutside your body and your\nlungs are not full of air,\nyou don't have that\nreally steep gradient\nof high pressure\noutside the body\nto low pressure\ninside your lungs.\nAnd so you actually have\nto put a lot more effort\ninto breathing air\ninto your lungs.\nYou have to really\nexert a lot of force.\nYou have to get the diaphragm,\nthose intercostal muscles\nworking really hard.\nYou might even find that\nyour shoulders are lifting\nwith each breath [INHALES]\nbecause you really\nhave to generate a lot of\nforce to get enough air\nand oxygen into your lungs.\nNow, an important\nprinciple to understand\nis that in humans, and\nin some other species,\nbut really what we're\ntalking about now\nis humans, when you inhale,\nthat's an active process.\nYou really need to\nuse those muscles\nof the intercostals\nand the diaphragm\nin order to inflate the lungs.\nBut the whole process\nis made easier\nwhen air pressure\noutside your body\nis higher than it\nis in your lungs\nbecause then they're going\nto fill up really readily.\nExhaling, at least for\nhumans, is a passive thing.\nYou just have to\nrelax the diaphragm\nand relax the intercostals and\nlet the rib cage kind of fall\nback to its original position.\nSo inhaling is active,\nand exhaling is passive.\nAnd so what happens is if\nyou're at a high altitude\nand the air pressure\nis very low,\nthen you have to\nput a lot of energy\ninto breathing air\ninto your lungs\nto get an equivalent amount\nof oxygen into your lungs\nand then into the bloodstream.\nSo that's why when you arrive\nat a high altitude location,\nfor the first few days, you're\ngoing to feel lightheaded\nmaybe a headache.\nYou're also going to have\nmore buildup of carbon\ndioxide in your system.\nAnd so the whole balance of\noxygen and carbon dioxide\nis going to be disrupted.\nI mention all that\nbecause, yes, indeed, there\nare some changes in\nthe atmospheric gases\nat high altitudes,\nand that can impact\nhow much oxygen you can\nbring into your system,\ninto your tissues.\nBut I've heard many explanations\nof why it's hard to breathe\nor why you feel\nlousy at altitude.\nWell, you just\ndiscovered one reason,\nwhich is that you don't have\nthat steep high pressure\nto low pressure gradient\nfrom the outside of the body\ninto the inside of the body.\nThe converse is also true.\nIf you've been at\naltitude for a few days\nand you've had the opportunity\nto adjust-- a lot of athletes,\nfor instance, will\ngo train at altitude.\nIt's hard for them in\nthe first days or weeks,\nand then they get really\ngood at training at altitude.\nThere are a number of\ndifferent adaptations\nthat occur in terms of\nthe amount of oxygen\nthat can be carried in\nthe blood by hemoglobin\nand the interactions between\ncarbon dioxide and hemoglobin\nand oxygen that\nallow more oxygen\nto be delivered to the tissues,\nsuch that, at altitude,\nyou can function just normally.\nBut if you then move very\nquickly from altitude-- say,\nyou've been training at\n8,000 feet or 10,000 feet.\nYou've been hiking up at that\nhigh level, and you've adapted,\nand you come down to sea level.\nWell, for about\ntwo to five days,\nyou're going to feel\nlike an absolute beast.\nYou're going to be able\nto essentially deliver\nfar more oxygen to your\nmuscles per breath.\nIn part, that is\nbecause of the way\nthat the hemoglobin and the\noxygen that it's carrying\nhas been altered when you\nwere at high altitude.\nBut it's also because when you\nwere at that high altitude,\nthose intercostal muscles\nand those diaphragms\ngot trained up quite a bit and\nallowed you to generate more\nair volume for every breath.\nIn other words, those\nmuscles got stronger,\nand you got more efficient\nat driving the phrenic nerve\nconsciously to [INHALES] really\nbreathe in a lot of oxygen\nso you don't feel lightheaded,\nheadache, et cetera.\nOK, so that's a little\nbit of an aside.\nBut it's an important aside,\nI believe, because, A,\nit answers a question\na lot of people ask\nand they a lot of people\nwonder about and, B,\nbecause it incorporates both the\nmechanical aspects of breathing\nand the chemical\naspects of breathing.\nI realize it's a little bit\nof a unusual circumstance.\nBut now if anyone\nasks you why it's\nhard to breathe at\naltitude, you know\nit has to do with this\nlack of a high pressure\nto low pressure\ngradient across the body\nand with the\natmosphere outside you.\nIt's also an opportunity\nfor me to say\nthat if you do find\nyourself at altitude\nand you have a headache or\nyou're feeling like you just\ncan't catch your breath,\nspending some time really\nconsciously trying to draw\nin larger breaths of air,\nas much as that\nmight seem fatiguing\nand you'll be short of\nbreath, it will allow\nyou to adapt more quickly.\nAnd a little bit\nlater in the episode,\nwe'll touch on a few\nmethods, including\ndeliberate hyperventilation\ncombined with some breath\nholds, that can allow\nyou to deliver more\noxygen to the cells\nimmediately upon arriving\nat altitude so you\ndon't get quite\nas much headache,\ndisorientation, and so on.\nSo leaving breathing\nat altitude aside let's\nall come back down to the\nsame conceptual level.\nWe can ask ourselves,\nfor instance,\nwhat is healthy breathing, and\nwhat is unhealthy breathing?\nAnd the first place\nwe want to tackle this\nis within the context of sleep.\nSo when we go to sleep at\nnight, we continue to breathe.\nThat's no surprise.\nIf we didn't, we would\ndie during sleep.\nHowever, there is\na large fraction\nof the population that\nunderbreathes during sleep.\nThey're not taking deep enough\nor frequent enough breaths.\nAnd therefore, they\nare experiencing\nwhat's called sleep apnea.\nThey are becoming\nhypoxic, hypo-oxic.\nThere's less oxygen being\nbrought into their system\nthan is necessary.\nPeople that are\ncarrying excess weight,\neither fat weight or\nmuscle weight or both,\nare more prone to\nnighttime sleep apnea.\nHowever, there are\na lot of people\nwho are not overweight who\nalso experience sleep apnea.\nHow do you know if you're\nexperiencing sleep apnea?\nWell, first of all,\nexcessive daytime sleepiness\nand excessive daytime\nanxiety combined\nwith daytime\nsleepiness is one sign\nthat you might be\nsuffering from sleep apnea.\nThe other thing is if\nyou happen to snore,\nit's very likely that you\nare experiencing sleep apnea.\nAnd I should mention that sleep\napnea is a very serious health\nconcern.\nIt greatly increases\nthe probability\nof a cardiovascular event,\nheart attack, stroke.\nIt is a precursor or\nsometimes the direct cause\nof sexual dysfunction\nin males and females.\nCognitive dysfunction\nduring the daytime.\nIt can exacerbate the\neffects of dementia,\nwhether or not it's age-related\ndementia of the normal sort\nor Alzheimer's type\ndementia, which\nis an acceleration of\nage-related cognitive decline.\nIf you're somebody who\nhas had a traumatic brain\ninjury, if you're\nexperiencing a lot of stress,\nsleep apnea is going\nto greatly disrupt\nthe amount of oxygen brought\nin to your brain and body\nduring sleep and\nis going to lead\nto a number of nighttime\nand daytime issues.\nSo it's something that\nreally needs to be addressed.\nAnd we'll get into\nthis a bit more later.\nBut since I raised\nit as a problem,\nI do want to raise the solution.\nOne of the major\ntreatments for sleep apnea\nis that people will get\na CPAP device, which\nis this face mask and a machine\nthat they'll sleep with.\nAnd while those can\nbe very effective,\nnot everyone needs a CPAP.\nOne of the more common\nmethods nowadays\nthat's being used to\ntreat sleep apnea,\nwhich is purely behavioral,\nan intervention,\nand is essentially zero\ncost, is that people\nare starting to\nshift deliberately\nto nasal breathing\nduring sleep because\nof the additional resistance\nof nasal breathing\nand because of the\nfact that there's\nfar less tendency if\nany, excuse me, to snore\nwhen nasal breathing.\nTaping the mouth shut using\nmedical tape prior to sleep--\nexcuse me.\nPutting medical tape on the\nmouth prior to going to sleep\nand then sleeping all night\nwith medical tape on the mouth\nis one way that people can learn\nto nasal breathe during sleep\nand can greatly offset a\nlot of sleep apnea, snoring,\nand sleep-related issues.\nA number of people\ndon't want to or don't\nfeel safe putting medical tape\non their mouth prior to sleep.\nFor some reason, they think\nthey're going to suffocate.\nBut, of course,\nyou would wake up\nif you start to run out\nof air at any moment.\nSo that's not so much a concern.\nBut what they'll do\nis they will start\nto use pure nasal breathing\nduring any type of exercise\nor even just for some period\nof time walking during the day\nor while working.\nAnd, again, later, we'll get\ninto the enormous benefits\nof shifting to pure nasal\nbreathing when not exercising\nhard, meaning at a rate\nthat you could normally\nhold a conversation-- although\nif you're pure nasal breathing,\nyou won't be holding\nthat conversation--\nor when simply doing work\nor any number of things\nthat are of low intensity.\nYou can train your system to\nbecome a better nasal breather\nduring the daytime\nthrough these deliberate\nactions of taping the mouth\nshut or just being conscious\nof keeping your mouth shut.\nAnd that, in addition to having\na number of positive health\nand aesthetic effects\nduring the daytime,\nis known to also transfer to\nnighttime breathing patterns\nand allow people to become\nnasal breathers as opposed\nto mouth breathers during\nsleep and to snore less\nand to have less sleep apnea.\nAgain, if you have\nsevere sleep apnea,\nyou probably do need\nto check out a CPAP.\nYou should talk\nto your physician.\nBut for people who have\nminor sleep apnea or sleep\napnea that's starting\nto take hold,\nthese other methods of shifting\nto becoming a nasal breather\nare going to be far more\nbeneficial and far more cost\neffective than going all the way\nto the CPAP, which, by the way,\ndoesn't really teach you\nhow to breathe properly\nas much as it does adjust the\nairflow going into your system.\nThat's an important point,\nthat when you shift from mouth\nto nasal breathing\nduring sleep, you're\nactually learning and\ntraining your system\nto breathe properly.\nAnd when I say\nlearning and training\nyour system to breathe\nproperly, what do I mean?\nLet's put some scientific\nand mechanistic meat on that.\nWe already talked about the\nphrenic nerve, this nerve\nthat innervates the diaphragm\nand that allows for the lungs\nto fill up because of the\nmovement of the diaphragm.\nWhat we didn't talk\nabout, however,\nwere the brain\ncenters that actually\ncontrol the phrenic nerve\nand control breathing.\nKnowing about these two\nbrain areas and what they do\nis extremely important, not just\nfor understanding the content\nof this episode but for\nunderstanding all of the tools\nthat we'll discuss and, indeed,\nyour general health as it\nrelates to respiration.\nSo there are basically\ntwo areas of the brain\nthat control breathing.\nThe first is called the\npre-Botzinger complex.\nYou don't have to worry\nabout the name so much.\nJust know that it was named\nafter a bottle of wine\nand that it was discovered by\nthe great Jack Feldman, who's\na professor of neuroscience at\nthe University of California,\nLos Angeles.\nThis is one of the most\nfundamental discoveries\nin all of neuroscience\nin the last hundred years\nor more because this brain area\nthat Jack and his colleagues\ndiscovered controls all aspects\nof breathing that are rhythmic,\nthat is, when inhales\nfollow exhales\nfollow inhales follow exhales.\nThat's all controlled\nby a small set\nof neurons in this\nbrainstem area,\nso around the\nregion of the neck,\ncalled the\npre-Botzinger complex.\nAnd we really owe\na debt of gratitude\nto Jack and his colleagues\nfor discovering that area\nbecause it's involved in\neverything from breathing when\nwe're asleep to\nbreathing when we're not\nthinking about our breathing.\nIt may have a role--\nthat is, when its\nfunction is disrupted,\nit may cause things like\nsudden infant death syndrome.\nBelieve it or not,\nit can explain\nin large part many of the deaths\nrelated to the opioid crisis\nbecause exogenous opioids\nlike fentanyl and other sorts\nof drugs, which are\nopioids obviously,\nbind to opioid receptors on\nthat structure and shut it down.\nNow, keep in mind these\nneurons are designed\nto be incredibly robust and\nare designed to fire inhale,\nexhale, inhale, exhale no\nmatter if we're awake or aware,\nunaware or asleep\nto keep us alive.\nExogenous opioids like\nfentanyl and drugs\nthat are similar to that\ncan shut down that structure\nbecause it's rich with\nthese opioid receptors.\nSo it binds to that,\nand it shuts off\nthe pre-Botzinger\ncomplex, which is\nthe major cause\nof death of people\nwho die from opioid overdoses.\nI think a lot of people\ndon't realize that.\nThey think, oh, the opioids\nmust shut off the brain\nor shut down the heart.\nNo, it shuts down breathing.\nSo Jack's discovery\nno doubt will\nlead to some important things\nas it relates to addiction,\nand hopefully I think we frankly\ncan expect that it's also\ngoing to eventually lead to\nways to prevent death in people\nusing opioids or\nother types of drugs,\nmaybe by blocking\nopioid receptors\nin pre-Botzinger\ncomplex using things\nlike naltrexone, et cetera.\nIn any event,\npre-Botzinger complex\nis controlling inhale, exhale,\ninhale, exhale patterns\nof breathing.\nThe other brain center\ncontrolling breathing, again,\nthrough the phrenic nerve--\nit all converges and goes\nout through the phrenic nerve\nin these intercostal muscles--\nis the so-called\nparafacial nucleus.\nAnd the parafacial nucleus\nis involved in patterns\nof breathing where there is not\nan inhale followed by exhale,\ninhale followed by exhale--\nthat is, it's not rhythmic,\none than the other--\nbut, rather, where there\nis a doubling up of inhales\nor a doubling up of exhales or\na deliberate pause in breathing,\nso inhale, pause, exhale, pause,\ninhale, pause, exhale, pause,\nthis sort of thing.\nA little bit later, we'll\ntalk about a pattern\nof breathing called\nbox breathing, which\nhas very specific and\nuseful applications,\nin particular for\nadjusting anxiety.\nAnd in that case, it involves\ngoing from rhythmic breathing\nof inhale, inhale,\ninhale, exhale, that is,\nrelying on the pre-Botzinger\ncomplex neurons,\nto reliance on the parafacial\nnucleus neurons and box\nbreathing, just to give\naway what's probably\nalready obvious, as you inhale,\nhold, exhale, hold, and repeat.\nAnd that pattern of\nbreathing, even though it's\nrhythmic in nature because\ninhales precede exhales precede\ninhales and so on, there's\na deliberate breath hold\ninserted there.\nSo anytime we're taking\nconscious control\nof our breathing, the parafacial\nnucleus is getting involved.\nNow, you don't have to assume\nthat the parafacial nucleus is\nthe only way in which we\ntake conscious control\nof our breathing.\nWe can also take control of\nthe pre-Botzinger complex.\nYou can do that right now.\nSo for instance,\nyou are breathing\nin some specific pattern\nnow that, unless you're\nspeaking or eating, no doubt\nis going to involve inhales\nfollowed by exhales.\nBut you could, for\ninstance, decide\nthat, yes, inhales are active\nand exhales are passive.\nBut now you're going to make\nthe exhales active as well.\nSo rather than just inhale and\nthen let your lungs deflate,\nyou could inhale [INHALES]\nand then force the air out.\n[EXHALES] That's going to\nrepresent a conscious taking\nover of control of the\npre-Botzinger complex.\nAnd so the reason I'm giving\nthis mechanistic detail is, A,\nit's super important if you\nwant to understand all the tools\nrelated to breathing.\nB, it's actually a\npretty simple system.\nEven though the areas\nhave fancy names\nlike pre-Botzinger\nor parafacial,\nit's pretty straightforward.\nYou have one area that\ncontrols rhythmic breathing--\ninhale follows exhales-- and the\nother area which gets involved\nin breathing any time\nyou start doubling up\non inhales or exhales.\nIn fact, the parafacial\nnucleus is the one\nthat you're relying on\nwhile you speak in order\nto make sure that you\nstill get enough oxygen.\nIt's also the one\nthat you will use\nif you incorporate the\nphysiological sigh or box\nbreathing.\nAnd, frankly, most\nof the time, you're\nusing both of these circuits\nor these brain systems,\nparafacial and\npre-Botzinger, in parallel.\nAgain, biology loves\nparallel systems,\nespecially for\nthings that are so\ncritical that if we didn't\ndo them, we would die,\nlike breathing.\nAnd so it makes sense that\nwe have two different brain\nstructures that control this.\nSo now you have an understanding\nof the mechanical control\nof breathing, that is,\nthe different parts\nwithin the parts list that\nare involved in breathing,\neverything from nose to mouth\nto alveoli, the lungs, et\ncetera, and the muscles\ninvolved in moving the lungs.\nYou understand, I like to think,\na bit about bringing oxygen\nin and removing carbon dioxide\nbut not so much carbon dioxide\nthat you can't actually use\nthe oxygen that you have.\nAnd you know about\ntwo brain centers,\none controlling rhythmic\nbreathing and one that\ncontrols nonrhythmic breathing.\nI want to repeat something that\nI said a little bit earlier\nas well, which is that\nbreathing is incredible\nbecause it represents\nthe interface\nbetween conscious and\nsubconscious control\nover your not just body,\nnot just your lungs,\nbut that how you breathe\ninfluences your brain state.\nSo by using your\nbrain consciously\nto control your breathing,\nyou are using your brain\nto control your brain.\nThe best way I've ever\nheard this described\nwas from a beautiful,\nI should say now\nclassic paper in The Journal\nof Physiology, published\nin 1988 from\nBalestrino and Somjen,\nwhere the final line of\ntheir summary intro states,\n\"The brain, by\nregulating breathing,\ncontrols its own excitability.\"\nAnd just to remind\nthose of you that\ndon't remember what\nexcitability is,\nexcitability is the threshold\nat which a given neuron, nerve\ncell can be active or not.\nSo when we breathe a certain\nway, the neurons of our brain\nare more likely to get engaged.\nThey're more likely\nto be active.\nAnd when we breathe\nin other ways,\nour brain becomes\nharder to activate.\nIts excitability is reduced.\nNow, you might think\nexcitability is a great thing.\nYou always want your\nbrain to be excitable.\nBut that's actually\nnot the case.\nAnd, in fact, that\nvery statement\nthat Balestrino\nand Somjen made led\nto a number of\nother investigations\nthat were really\nimportant in defining\nhow if people\noverbreathe, that is,\nif they hyperventilate, at\nrest, they expel, that is, they\nexhale too much\ncarbon dioxide, what\nthat classic paper by\nBalestrino and Somjen led to\nwas a number of\ndifferent investigations\nin humans looking at how\ndifferent patterns of breathing\nimpact the overall state of\nthe brain and the ability\nof the brain to\nrespond to certain what\nare called sensory stimuli.\nKeep in mind that your\nbrain is always active.\nThe neurons are firing at low\nlevel, low level, low level.\nBut when you see something\nor hear something,\nor you want to\nfocus on something,\nor you want to exercise or\nreally listen to something\nor learn, certain\ncircuits in your brain\nneed to be more active\nthan everything else.\nThat is, there needs to\nbe really high what's\ncalled signal to noise.\nThere's always a lot of noise\nand chatter in the background,\njust like the chatter\nat a cocktail party\nor at a stadium event.\nIn order to really pay\nattention, focus, learn,\nall the incredible things\nthat the brain can do,\nyou need that signal\nto get above the noise.\nThere's a beautiful\npaper that asks,\nhow does the pattern of\nbreathing, in particular, how\ndoes overbreathing, change\nthe patterns of activity\nin the brain?\nThis is a paper\nentitled \"Effects\nof Voluntary Hyperventilation\non Cortical Sensory Responses.\"\nAnd I will provide a link to\nthe study in the show note\ncaptions.\nIt's a somewhat\ncomplicated paper\nif you look at all\nthe detailed analyzes.\nHowever, the takeaway from this\npaper is exquisitely simple\nand I also believe\nincredibly important.\nBasically, what it\nshowed is that when\npeople hyperventilate,\nthey expel, that is,\nthey exhale more carbon dioxide\nthan they would normally.\nSo they become what's\ncalled hypocapnic, OK?\nCarbon dioxide levels\nare low in the blood.\nAnd over a short\nperiod of time, they\nbecome low in the\ntissues of the body.\nWhen that carbon\ndioxide level drops low,\nyou would say, OK,\nwell, you're still\nbringing in a lot of\noxygen, because these people\nare hyperventilating.\nSo they should\nfeel really alert.\nAnd, indeed, that's\nwhat happens.\nThe people feel very alert.\nHowever, because\nthey're not bringing\nenough carbon dioxide in\nor, rather, the proper way\nto say it would be because\nthey're overbreathing,\nexhaling too much, they are\nnot retaining or keeping\nin enough carbon dioxide.\nWell, then that lack\nof carbon dioxide\nmeans that the oxygen\nthat they are breathing in\ncan't be liberated\nfrom the hemoglobin,\ncan't get to the brain.\nAnd what they observe\nis about a 30% to 40%\nreduction in the\namount of oxygen that's\nbeing delivered to the brain.\nAnd the reduction\nin carbon dioxide\nalso prevents some of the\nnormal patterns of vasodilation,\nthe dilating, the opening\nup of the capillaries,\nso, again, less blood flow.\nBut most importantly, as\nit's shown in this paper,\nthe brain overall\nbecomes hyperexcitable.\nIt's as if it's being starved\nof oxygen and blood flow.\nAnd all the neurons in\na very nonspecific way\nstart increasing\ntheir firing levels.\nSo the background activity\nis getting louder and louder.\nIt's like the rumble or the\nnoise of a crowd at a stadium.\nAnd as a consequence, the\nsensory input from a sound\nor from a touch or from some\nother event in the world\ndoesn't get above the noise.\nWhat this means is that\nwhen we hyperventilate,\nbecause we aren't retaining\nenough carbon dioxide,\nwe are not getting enough\noxygen to the tissues\nthat need oxygen. And as a\nconsequence of that, the brain\nbecomes hyperexcitable.\nWe actually know that there's\nan increase in anxiety.\nAnd we become less\ngood, less efficient\nat detecting things\nin our environment.\nSo we're not processing\ninformation as well at all.\nThe noise goes up, and\nthe signal goes down.\nAgain, incredibly\nimportant set of findings.\nI should also mention\nthat hyperventilation\nis one way that, in\nthe laboratory anyway\nor in neurosurgery\nunits for some time,\nphysicians would evoke seizure\nin seizure-prone patients.\nThe reason that works is\nexactly the explanation\nI just gave you.\nSeizure is a excitability\nof the brain, not enough\ninhibition or suppression\nof the overall circuitry.\nSo you get these waves or these\nstorms of electrical activity.\nLow levels of carbon\ndioxide in the brain because\nof low levels of carbon\ndioxide in the blood\nare one of the major\ntriggers for seizures.\nNow, I realize that most\npeople listening to this\nare not epileptic.\nBut nonetheless, this\nbrings us all back\nto this question of what is\nnormal healthy breathing.\nAs I mentioned before,\nnormal healthy breathing\nis breathing about six\nliters of air per minute.\nBut of course, most\nof us don't think\nin terms of liters\nof air, and we're not\ngoing to measure our lung\ncapacity, at least most of us\naren't going to do that.\nBasically, if you are taking\nrelatively shallow breaths\nand you're just sitting there\nworking or maybe even walking\nslowly, again, not\ntalking or engaging\nin any kind of speech\nor eating, chances\nare six liters of air per minute\nis about 12 shallowish breaths.\nAnd when I say\nshallow, I don't mean\nbreathing [INHALES SHALLOWLY]\nlike a little bunny\nrabbit or something like that.\nI just mean casually\nbreathing in out, in out.\nThe studies that have explored\nthe breathing patterns\nin large populations of\nindividuals who are not\nsuffering necessarily from\nany one specific ailment\nhave shown that most\npeople breathe far too much\nper minute, that\nthey're engaging\nin anywhere from\n15 to 20 or even 30\nshallow breaths per minute.\nSo they are vastly\noverbreathing relative to how\nthey should be breathing.\nNow, of course, if you\nbreathe more deeply,\nso you take a vigorous\ninhale [INHALES]\nand then you expel\nthat air, well,\nthen to get six liters of air\ninto your system per minute,\nyou're probably only going to\nneed somewhere between four\nand six breaths in order to\nget that six liters per minute.\nNow, the total\ntime that it takes\nto do that inhale and exhale\nisn't that much longer\nthan a shallow breath, provided\nyou're not deliberately\nbreathing quickly during\nthose shallow breaths.\nSo then you say, well, how is\nit that normal healthy breathing\nthat delivers the appropriate\namount of carbon dioxide\ninto the system\nand doesn't expel,\ndoesn't exhale too\nmuch carbon dioxide--\nhow are we supposed to\ndo that normal breathing?\nAre you supposed to\nbreathe four times\nand then hold your breath\nuntil the minute passes?\nNo.\nWhat you find is that the\ncorrect pattern of breathing\nis going to involve two things.\nFirst of all, nasal breathing,\nbecause of the resistance\nit provides through the nose\nthat we talked about earlier,\nis going to deliver more\noxygen into your system.\nYou're going to be able\nto generate more air\npressure to fill your lungs.\nThat greater air pressure is\ngoing to take longer to exhale.\nSo already we're increasing\nthe amount of time\nthat each breath\nis going to take.\nAnd also what you find\nis that people that\nare breathing in the proper\nhealthy manner, that is,\nthat are balancing\noxygen and carbon\ndioxide in the\nproper ways, are also\ntaking pauses between breaths.\nThis is extremely important.\nBecause even though we\nhave a brain center,\nthe pre-Botzinger complex, that\ncan control or, I should say,\ndoes control inhale-exhale\nrhythmic breathing,\nthose pauses between breaths\nare not always present\nand, in fact, often\nare not present\nfrom people's baseline\nbreathing patterns.\nAs a consequence,\nthey overbreathe.\nAnd as I told you before,\nwhen people overbreathe,\ntheir brain becomes\nhyperexcitable\nat the level of the\nbackground noise.\nAnd yet they are less efficient\nat detecting and learning\ninformation.\nWe'll get into the\nspecific studies\nthat really illustrate the\nlearning aspect a bit later.\nBut they are less efficient\nat detecting and learning\ninformation, at focusing,\nand so on as a consequence\nof this overbreathing\nand the hyperexcitability\nthat it causes.\nNow, of course, that's\nalso just emphasizing\nthe effects of\noverbreathing and lack\nof carbon dioxide on the brain.\nThere are hundreds,\nif not thousands\nof studies showing that when\nwe don't have enough carbon\ndioxide in the\ntissues of our body,\nthat's also problematic for\nall the tissues-- the liver,\nthe lungs themselves, the\nstomach, et cetera-- that\nrelate largely to shifts\nin pH because of the fact\nthat carbon dioxide\nstrongly regulates\nthe acidity, alkalinity of\nthe blood and the tissues\nthat that blood\nsupplies nutrients to,\nincluding carbon dioxide.\nSo the basic\ntakeaway here is you\nwant to breathe in a\nhealthy manner at rest.\nAnd the best way to do that\nis to spend some time--\nand it doesn't take much,\nmaybe a minute or so each day--\npaying attention to how quickly\nyou are breathing per minute\nwhen you are simply at rest,\nwhen you're making coffee\nin the morning, when you're\nsitting down to read,\nwhen you're on social media.\nChronically holding\nyour breath isn't good\nbut neither is overbreathing.\nAnd, again, every study that has\nexamined the typical patterns\nof breathing and\npatterns of breathing\nthat show up as\nnormal and abnormal\nhas found that more\noften than not,\nduring the nighttime,\npeople are underbreathing.\nAnd in the daytime,\nthey are overbreathing.\nThey're hyperventilating.\nI'd like to just\ntake a brief moment\nand thank one of our\npodcast sponsors, which\nis InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto better understand your body\nand help you reach your health\ngoals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that blood\nwork is the only way that you\ncan monitor the markers, such\nas hormone markers, lipids,\nmetabolic factors, et\ncetera, that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health.\nOne major challenge\nwith blood work,\nhowever, is that\nmost of the time, it\ndoes not come back with\nany information about what\nto do in order to move\nthe values for hormones,\nmetabolic factors, lipids,\net cetera, into the ranges\nthat you want.\nWith InsideTracker,\nchanging those values\nbecomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized\ndashboard that you\ncan use to address\nthe nutrition-based,\nbehavior-based,\nsupplement-based approaches\nthat you can use in order\nto move those values\ninto the ranges that\nare optimal for you, your\nvitality, and your longevity.\nInsideTracker now\nincludes a measurement\nof apolipoprotein B, so-called\napoB, in their ultimate plan.\nAboB is a key marker of\ncardiovascular health,\nand therefore,\nthere's extreme value\nto knowing your apoB levels.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can go to\nInsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's\nInsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 20% off.\nSo next, I'd like\nto address what\nyou can do about your normal\npatterns of breathing,\nthat is, how you or\nanyone can adjust\ntheir normal patterns of\nbreathing from an unhealthy\nto an unhealthy state.\nBut the first thing we\nhave to do, of course,\nis determine whether\nor not you're already\nbreathing in an unhealthy\nor in a healthy way.\nAnd, again, when I say\nhealthy or unhealthy, I mean,\nare you overbreathing?\nAre you underbreathing?\nAre you delivering\nthe appropriate ratios\nof oxygen and carbon\ndioxide to the tissues\nof your brain and body?\nIn order to do this, we're\ngoing to do a simple test.\nAgain, please\ndon't do this while\ndriving or operating heavy\nmachinery or near water\nof any kind.\nBut assuming that you're not\ndoing any of those things,\nI encourage you to\nsit down, certainly\nnot lie down but just sit down.\nI suppose you also\ncould do it standing.\nAnd we are going to do what's\ncalled the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test.\nThe carbon dioxide\ntolerance test\nis a sort of back\nof the envelope\nmeasure of how well you are\nmanaging carbon dioxide,\nthat is, how well you can\ncontrol your breathing\nat both the mechanical\nand the chemical level.\nIt's a very simple test.\nWhat you're going to do\nis for the next 10 seconds\nor so while I'm speaking, you're\njust going to breathe normally.\nNow, again and again\nthroughout this episode,\nI'm going to encourage you to\nbe a nasal breather whenever\npossible.\nBut of course, there are\ninstances in which you\nwant to engage mouth breathing.\nBut for the time\nbeing, as I continue\nto blab on for the\nnext few seconds,\njust inhale through your nose,\nexhale through your nose.\nYou don't have to deliberately\nslow your breathing\nor increase the cadence\nof your breathing.\nHowever, in that\ntime, you're also\ngoing to want to find some\nsort of time measuring\ndevice, like could be your phone\nor it could be a stopwatch.\nWhat I'm going to ask you\nto do in a few minutes\nis I'm going to ask you to\ninhale through your nose\nas deeply as you possibly can.\nThat is, you're going to fill\nyour lungs as much as you\ncan through your nose.\nAnd then start a\ntimer and measure\nhow long it takes for you\nto deliberately control\nthat exhale until\nyour lungs are empty.\nSo this is going to\nbe a controlled exhale\nthrough the nose after\na big deep breath.\nBut for the time\nbeing, keep breathing\nat a kind of calm,\nregular cadence.\nSo you can find that time\nmeasuring device now,\nor you can come back to\nit later if you like.\nWhen I say inhale, you're going\nto inhale as deeply as you can\nthrough your nose, remembering\nthat the diaphragm can really\nhelp you here to get a\ndeep inhale by having\nyour belly move out\nwhile you inhale.\nAnd then when I\nsay start, you're\ngoing to measure the\ntime that it takes to do\na complete lungs empty exhale.\nIn fact, I'll\nmeasure it for you.\nThis will be one of the rare\ninstances in this podcast\nwhere there's going to be\na long period of silence\nas I measure something.\nSo I've got a stopwatch here.\nSo please prepare to do the big\ninhale and start inhaling now.\nSo inhale as deeply as\nyou can through your nose.\nFill your lungs as\nmuch as you can.\nOK?\nNow start, meaning\nslowly control the exhale\nthrough your nose.\nYou're trying to let that air\nout as slowly as possible.\nAnd I'm just going to call out\nevery 10 or 15 seconds or so.\nAnd you want to note when\nyour lungs are empty.\nI know you can hold your\nbreath with your lungs empty.\nThat is not an accurate measure.\n15 seconds.\nIt is important that when\nnote your lungs are empty\nand that you're trying to\ncontrol the exhale as much\nas possible so that you don't\narrive at that lungs empty time\ntoo quickly.\nI'll explain what\ntoo quickly means.\n30 seconds.\nOK, for those of you that have\nalready reached lungs empty,\nplease go back to\nbreathing normally.\nFor those of you\nthat haven't, you\ncan hang in here a little\nlonger if you're still\ndiscarding that air.\n45 seconds.\nAnd we're rounding toward\na minute, not quite there.\nSome of you are probably\nstill letting out that air.\nI want to point out\nnone of this has\nto do with cardiovascular\nfitness level, at least\nnot in any kind of direct way.\nAnd 60 seconds.\nAnd I realize there will\nbe a small subset of you\nout there that are\nstill expelling\nyour air in a slow lungs--\nslow exhale manner\nthrough the nose.\nOK, so what we just did is a\nback of the envelope carbon\ndioxide discard rate if\nyou need to pause this\nand go back and try\nit again you just\nwant to time how\nlong it takes you\nto go from lungs full\nto lungs empty, again,\nwith the full understanding I\nknow that you can all sit there\nlike beasts and hold your\nbreath with your lungs empty.\nBut please don't do that\nbecause that's not going\nhas been informative for\nwhat I'm telling you now.\nWhat I'm going to\ntell you now is\nthat if it took you 20 seconds\nor less to expel all your air,\nthat is, you couldn't\nextend that exhale longer\nthan 20 seconds, in a kind\nof back of the envelope way,\nwe can say that have a\nrelatively brief or low carbon\ndioxide tolerance.\nIf it took you somewhere between\n25 and 40, maybe 45 seconds\nto expel all your\nair, that is, you\ncould control that exhale for\nabout 45 seconds or 30 seconds,\nthen you have a moderate level\nof carbon dioxide tolerance.\nAnd if, for instance, you\nwere able to go 50 seconds\nor longer for that discard\nuntil you hit lungs empty,\nyou have a fairly high degree\nof carbon dioxide tolerance.\nNow, here's the deal.\nIf you had low carbon\ndioxide tolerance, that\nis, you're 20 seconds\nor less, you're\ngoing to write down\nthe number three.\nIf you had moderate levels\nof carbon dioxide tolerance,\nyou're going to write\ndown the number five.\nor you could even\nput five to six.\nAnd then if you are in\nthat bracket of people\nthat was able to discard your\nair over a period of 50 seconds\nor more, you're going to\nwrite down the number 8 to 10.\nOK?\nNow, what are these numbers?\nWhat are we talking about?\nAnd before we get into what\nto do with these numbers,\nI want to emphasize\nagain, this does not\nhave to do with\nfitness level per se.\nI know some world\nclass triathletes\nthat have very fast carbon\ndioxide blow-off times.\nThat is, their discard rates\nare 20 seconds or less.\nI should also point out that\nif you're very stressed,\nthat number is going\nto be very small.\nIf you're very relaxed,\nlike you just woke up\nafter a long night of\nsleep and you feel great,\nthat number is going\nto be extended.\nSo this is a back of\nthe envelope measure\nthat you're going\nto use each time you\ndecide to do the\nexercise I'm going\nto tell you about in a moment.\nAnd the exercise I'm going\nto tell you about in a moment\ncan be done every\nday if you like.\nBut what the most interesting\nstudies, at least to me,\nindicate is that you\ncould do the exercise\nI'll tell you about even\njust once or twice a week\nand greatly improve your\nefficiency of breathing\nand shift yourself away from\noverbreathing when at rest,\neven if you're not\nthinking about how\nyou're breathing at rest.\nSo what is this exercise?\nWell, you just got your number,\neither low, medium, or high\nbracket number for carbon\ndioxide discard rate.\nRemember, if you're in the low\ncategory, your number is three.\nIf you're medium,\nit's five to six.\nAnd if you are in the\nlong carbon dioxide\ndiscard rate, long\nduration carbon\ndioxide discard rate, that\nis, 8 to 10 is your number.\nNow you're going to do two\nminutes of what most people\nwould call box breathing.\nWhat is box breathing?\nBox breathing are equal\nduration inhale, hold,\nexhale, hold, repeat.\nSo inhale, hold, exhale, hold.\nSounds very easy, right?\nHow long do you inhale and then\nhold, exhale and then hold?\nWell, you now know.\nIf you are in the low group of\ncarbon dioxide discard rate,\nyour inhale is going to be\nthree seconds, your hold will\nbe three seconds, your\nexhale will be three seconds,\nand then you repeat,\nthree seconds.\nSo each side of the\nbox, if you will,\nis going to be\nthree seconds long.\nIf you were in the moderate\ncarbon dioxide discard rate\ncategory, then you're going to\ninhale for five to six seconds,\nhold for five to six,\nexhale for five to six,\nhold for five to six, repeat\nfor about two minutes.\nYou could do three\nminutes if you want.\nBut I think it's important\nto have protocols that\nare feasible for most people.\nAnd that's going to mean\ndoing things for about two\nto five minutes when it comes\nto these breath rehabilitation\nexercises for restoring\nnormal breathing.\nAnd then, of course, if you are\nin the long category of carbon\ndioxide discard rate, you\nshould be able to do an 8 to 10\nsecond inhale, 8 to 10 second\nhold, 8 to 10 second exhale, 8\nto 10 second hold, and repeat.\nSo you could do\nthat exercise now\nif you like, or you could\ndo it at some point offline.\nYou can pause this podcast\nif you want and go try it.\nThat's an exercise\nthat you can do\nfor about two to three minutes\nonce or twice per week.\nWhat's happening when\nyou do that exercise?\nWell, first of all,\nyou are greatly\nincreasing your neuromechanical\ncontrol over the diaphragm.\nThis is very important.\nMost people are not aware\nof this phrenic nerve\npathway in the diaphragm.\nAnd you are greatly increasing\nyour mechanical control\nover this pathway\nthrough the process\nwe call neuroplasticity.\nWhen you deliberately focus on\na aspect of your nervous system\ncontrol and particular nervous\nsystem control over musculature\nthat normally is subconscious\nand you're not paying attention\nto and when you actively\ntake control of that,\nit requires that your\nbrain adjust and rewire\nthe relationship between\nthe different components\nof that circuit.\nAnd the wonderful\nthing is that has\nbeen shown to lead to changes\nin your resting pattern\nof breathing.\nNow, why did we go\nthrough the whole business\nof doing the carbon\ndioxide tolerance test?\nWell, for people who don't\ntolerate carbon dioxide very\nwell, they don't have\nvery good phrenic,\nthat is, neuromechanical\ncontrol of the diaphragm,\nfor whatever reason-- again,\nit doesn't mean you're not fit.\nIt just means you don't have\nor you have not yet developed\nneuromechanical control\nof the diaphragm.\nIt would be near\nimpossible for you\nto do box breathing for two\nor three minutes with eight\nseconds in, eight seconds\nhold, eight seconds exhale,\neight second hold.\nSo that's why we\ndo a test to see\nwhat you're capable of doing.\nYou don't want the box breathing\nto be too strained where you're\n[GRUNTS],, where you're\nreally challenged\nto get around the whole box.\nYou want it to be relatively\neasy because, remember,\nyou're trying to translate this\npattern to your normal pattern\nof breathing, that is,\nyour pattern of breathing\nwhen you're not consciously\nthinking about breathing.\nAnd what are we\nreally translating\nwhen we do this box\nbreathing type exercise?\nWhat you're translating\nis the ability\nto pause between\nbreaths and yet take\nfull mechanically-driven breaths\nthat involve the phrenic nerve\nand diaphragm.\nSo, again, you're\nencouraging, especially\nif you use nasal breathing\nwhen you do the box breathing--\nyou're encouraging phrenic\ncontrol over the diaphragm.\nAnd you're getting that six\nliters of air per minute\nor so using fewer and\nfewer breaths over time.\nSo this is a, again,\nzero cost-- although it\ndoes cost a little bit of\ntime-- zero cost approach\nto adjusting your normal pattern\nof breathing at rest, which\nhas a huge number of\npositive outcomes in terms\nof your ability to stay\nrelatively calm, to not\nget the hyperexcitability\nof the brain.\nIt has actually been\nshown in various studies--\nand we'll talk about one\nin particular later--\nto greatly improve not\njust levels of calm\nand reduce bouts of stress but\nalso improve nighttime sleep.\nThere are huge\nnumber of benefits\nthat can come from doing\nthis box breathing exercise.\nBut you got to get the duration\nof the size of the box right,\nand that's why you do the\ncarbon dioxide tolerance test.\nOne thing that\nmany people notice\nafter doing the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test even just once\nand then doing this box\nbreathing exercise once\nor twice a week is that after\ntwo or three weeks, the box\nbreathing itself\nbecomes very easy.\nAnd in that case, I recommend\ntaking the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test over again.\nAnd almost always\nwhat you'll find\nis that you have been\nable to extend your carbon\ndioxide discard rate,\nand therefore, you now\nfall into a different category,\nnot just the lower medium\nbut the long carbon dioxide\ndiscard rate category,\nand you are able to extend\nthe duration of those inhale,\nhold, exhale, holds\nduring the box breathing.\nAnd, of course, the\nultimate benefit of all this\nis that it translates to\ndeeper and yet less frequent\nbreathing when at rest and\nwhen not consciously paying\nattention to how you're\nbreathing during the daytime.\nAgain, if at all possible,\ndo all of this breathing\nthrough the nose.\nFor those of you that have\na severely occluded nose,\nthe recommendation always is to\nbreathe through your nose more.\nBut I do realize\nthat for some people,\nit's really uncomfortable\nto breathe through the nose\nbecause they have such an\noccluded nasal pathway.\nAnd for you folks, doing\nsome of this breathing\nthrough the mouth\ncan probably suffice.\nBut if at all possible, do the\nbreathing through the nose.\nAnd please also let me know how\nyour progress evolves over time\nwith the carbon dioxide discard\nrate and the box breathing.\nAnd of course, the\npositive shifts\nthat occur in normal\nunconscious daytime breathing\ntranslate to all\nthe opposite things\nthat we talked about when\nyou are overbreathing\nduring the daytime.\nSo what I just described in\nterms of the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test and the\nexercise using box breathing\nto restore normal\npatterns of breathing\nand not overbreathe and\ntherefore not eliminate\ntoo much carbon\ndioxide is exactly\nthe two tests that were\nincorporated into a study\nthat my laboratory\ndid in collaboration\nwith our associate\nchair of psychiatry\nat Stanford School of Medicine,\nDr. David Spiegel, who's\nalso been a guest on\nthis podcast previously.\nAnd that study\nexplored box breathing.\nBut it also explored\nother forms of breathing\nand actually compared those\nforms of deliberate breathing\nto meditation as\na means to explore\nwhat are going to be the\nminimal effective doses and most\neffective ways to chronically\nreduce stress around the clock\nand improve mood\nand improve sleep.\nSo the study I'm referring to\nwas just published recently.\nIt's entitled \"Brief Structured\nRespiration Practices Enhance\nMood and Reduce\nPhysiological Arousal.\"\nWe will also provide a link\nto this paper in the show note\ncaptions.\nWhat this study\nreally focused on\nwas a simple question, which is,\nwhat is the shortest and most\neffective practice that\npeople can use in order\nto reduce their levels of stress\nnot just during that breathwork\npractice or meditation practice\nbut around the clock, 24\nhours a day, including\nimprovements in sleep?\nAnd we were excited to do this\nstudy because many studies had\nexplored how meditation\nor, in some cases,\nfewer studies have\nexplored how breathwork\ncan impact different brain\nstates or bodily states.\nBut very few studies had\nexplored how those breathwork\nor meditation practices\ninfluenced body-brain states\naround the clock\nwhen people were not\nperforming the particular\nmeditation or breathwork\npractice.\nThe reason we were\nable to do this study\nwas really fortunate.\nThe folks over at WHOOP\nwere generous enough\nto donate a bunch of\nWHOOP straps, which\nallowed us to measure\nheart rate variability,\na number of other different\nphysiological parameters.\nWe also got subjective\nreports about people's mood\nand feelings of well-being.\nWe got data about their\nsleep pinged to us\nfrom remote locations.\nSo these people, rather than\nbeing brought to the laboratory\nand being in a very artificial\ncircumstance, the laboratory,\nas much as we like to\nthink our laboratory\nis realistic-- we\nhave virtual reality\nand things like\nthat-- there's nothing\nas realistic as the real world.\nAnd so we were able\nto have more than a\nhundred subjects out in the real\nworld living their real lives\npinging back to us data all\nthe time, 24 hours a day\nso that we could measure how\ntheir different interventions\nthat we asked them to\ndo, breathwork practices\nor meditation practices,\nwere impacting\nphysiological parameters.\nAnd they were also\ninforming us regularly\nabout their subjective\nmood, et cetera.\nWe got a lot of data,\nas you can imagine.\nAnd the basic takeaway\nfrom the study was twofold.\nFirst of all, we discovered that\ndeliberate breathwork practices\ndone for about five\nminutes per day\nacross the course\nof about a month led\nto greater reductions in stress\nthan did a five minute a day\nmeditation practice.\nNow, that is not to say that\nmeditation is not useful.\nIn fact, there are dozens,\nif not hundreds, of papers,\nincluding one\nparticular, I should\nsay, particularly beautiful\nstudy from Wendy Suzuki's lab\nat New York University showing\nthat a daily 10 to 13 minute\nmindfulness meditation practice\ncan greatly improve focus,\nmemory, and a number of other\nthings related to cognition\nand learning.\nHowever, the research\non meditation\nhas shown us that meditation,\nat least short meditations,\nmainly lead to improvements\nin focus and memory,\nnot so much reductions in\nstress, although they do\nlead to reductions in stress.\nWhat we found was that any\nnumber of different breathwork\npractices-- and we\nexplored three--\ndone for five minutes a\nday outperformed meditation\nin terms of the\nability of breathwork\nto reduce stress around the\nclock compared to meditation.\nThe three types of breathwork\nthat we explored also\nshowed different effects.\nI should mention the\nthree types of breathwork\nthat we compared were\nbox breathing of the sort\nthat you just learned about.\nWe compare that to something\ncalled cyclic sighing, which\ninvolves two inhales\nthrough the nose\nto get maximally inflated lungs\nfollowed by a long exhale.\nI'll return to that in a moment.\nThat was repeated\nfor five minutes\nat a time for each session.\nAnd a third breathwork\npractice, which\nwas cyclic hyperventilation,\nwhich, as the name suggests,\ninvolves people inhaling\ndeeply through the nose,\nthen exhaling passively\nthrough the mouth,\nand then repeating\ninhale through the nose,\nexhale through the\nmouth, repeating\nthat for 25 cycles, one cycle\nbeing an inhale and an exhale.\nSo that equals one cycle.\nRepeating that for 25 cycles,\nthen exhaling all their air\nand holding their\nbreath with lungs\nempty for about\n15 to 30 seconds,\nand then repeating inhale,\nexhale, cyclic hyperventilation\nfor the duration\nof five minutes.\nSo people were divided into\nthese different groups,\neither mindfulness\nmeditation where they sat,\nthey were not told to\ncontrol their breathing\nin any specific way.\nThey closed their eyes.\nThey focused their\nattention on a region\njust behind their forehead.\nOne group did that.\nThe other group\ndid cyclic sighing.\nAnother group did box breathing.\nAnother group did\ncyclic hyperventilation.\nAs any sort of clinical\ntrial like this ought to,\nwe then swapped people\ninto different groups.\nSo they served as\ntheir own control.\nSo we could evaluate\nany between and within\nindividual variability.\nAgain, there are a lot\nof data in this paper.\nBut the takeaway was that for\nthe sake of stress reduction\naround the clock and for\nthe sake of improving sleep\nand mood, the most\neffective practice\nof the four practices\nthat we examined\nwas the cyclic sighing.\nAgain, cyclic sighing is\nperformed the following way.\nYou inhale through the\nnose as deeply as you can.\nThen you do a second inhale\nimmediately afterwards to try\nand maximally inflate the lungs.\nIn fact, that's what happens.\nWe know that during\nthat second inhale,\neven if it's just a very\nsharp, short inhale,\nthe extra physical\nvigor that's required\nto generate that\nsecond inhale causes\nthose alveoli of the lungs,\nwhich may have collapsed--\nand, indeed, in between\nbreaths and often even just\nthrough the course of\nthe day and especially\nif we get stressed, those\nalveoli of the lungs\nstart to collapse.\nAnd because they're\ndamp on the inside--\nthey have a little bit of fluid.\nThey're like a balloon\nwith a little bit\nof fluid in the middle.\nIt takes a little\nbit of physical force\nto pop those open.\nNow, you're not literally\nexploding them pop.\nBut you're reinflating\nthem with air.\nAnd then you perform the\nlong exhale through the mouth\nuntil lungs are empty.\nSo it looks exactly like this.\n[INHALES DEEPLY]\n[INHALES SHARPLY]\n[EXHALES]\nNow, we know that one\nsingle physiological sigh\nof the sort that\nI just described\nperformed at any time of\nday under any conditions,\nwhether or not you're about to\nwalk on stage to give a talk\nor you're in a meeting and\nyou're feeling stressed,\nor you're in a conversation\nthat's very stressful,\nor you can feel stress mounting\nbecause you're in traffic\nor any number of psychological\nor physical stressors\nthat may be approaching\nyou or you feel\nare oppressing you, doing one\nphysiological sigh of the sort\nthat I just described is\nthe fastest physiologically\nverified way that we\nare aware of to reduce\nyour levels of stress and to\nreintroduce calm, that is,\nto shift your autonomic\nnervous system\nfrom a state of heightened\nlevels of autonomic arousal.\nThat is, sympathetic nervous\nsystem as, it's called,\nis at a higher activation\nlevel than the so-called\nparasympathetic nervous system.\nAgain, sympathetic nervous\nsystem having nothing\nto do with sympathy,\nhas everything\nto do with so-called\nfight or flight,\nalthough it controls\nother things,\ntoo, including positive arousal.\nAnd the parasympathetic\nnervous system,\noften referred to as the\nrest and digest system,\nalthough it does\nother things, too,\nis associated with calming.\nThose two things\nare always in kind\nof push-pull with one another,\nlike a seesaw or push-pull,\nhowever you want\nto think about it.\nOne physiological sigh,\nmeaning that big, deep inhale,\nshort second inhale\nalso through the nose,\nand then long exhale to\ncompletely lungs empty,\nis known to restore\nthe level of balance\nin the\nsympathetic-parasympathetic\nneural circuitry and\nis the fastest way\nto reintroduce calm.\nThat's one physiological sigh.\nIn this study, what we\nasked was that people\nperform that repeatedly,\nso-called cyclic sighing,\nfor the duration\nof five minutes.\nAnd the people who did\nthat cyclic sighing\nfor five minutes a day,\nregardless of the time of day\nthat they did it, experienced\nthe greatest reductions\nin stress not just\nduring the practice\nbut around the 24-hour cycle.\nAnd it translated,\nagain, to all sorts\nof positive subjective changes--\nimprovements in sleep, lower\nresting heart rate\nat all times of day.\nSo this is important.\nAgain, this study was\nnot just exploring\nwhat happens during\nmeditation or breathwork,\ncyclic sighing, et cetera.\nIt was exploring how the changes\nthat occur during that practice\ntranslate to\nchanges in breathing\nand heart rate, mood, et cetera,\nthroughout the 24-hour cycle.\nSo the takeaway here is twofold.\nFirst of all, if\nyou are somebody\nwho wants to improve\nyour mood and reduce\nyour overall levels\nof stress and you only\nhave five minutes a\nday to invest in that,\nhopefully you're doing\nall the other things\nlike trying to get proper\nsleep and exercise,\nsocial connection, nutrition,\net cetera, sunlight\nin the morning, of course.\nCan't leave that out.\nBut if you were going to\ndevote five minutes a day\nto a stress reduction\npractice that is now supported\nby data to translate\nto reductions in stress\naround the clock,\nthe data say that you\nwould want to invest that\nin cyclic sighing, that is,\ndouble inhale through\nthe nose, extended exhale\nthrough the mouth until\nyour lungs are empty,\nthen repeat for\nfive minutes a day.\nYou, of course, if you\nlike, could do meditation.\nIt still had positive\neffects, meaning\nit reduced stress, although\nnot as much as cyclic sighing.\nYou could do box\nbreathing if you\nwant for the purpose\nof reducing stress.\nAll the practices we\nexplored did reduce stress.\nBut cyclic sighing performed\nfor five minutes a day\nhad the most robust\nand pervasive effect\nin reducing stress, improving\nmood, and improving sleep.\nThat's the first\nmessage of the study.\nThe second takeaway is that\none physiological sigh--\nthat's right just one\nphysiological sigh, where\nyou inhale deeply\nthrough the nose\nanother inhale through the\nnose to maximally inflate\nthe alveoli of the\nlungs, and then you\nexhale to completely lungs\nempty and then go back\nto normal breathing,\nis the fastest\nway to introduce a level\nof calm and to reduce\nyour overall levels of\nstress in real time.\nAnd this is very important.\nI think that out\nthere these days,\nwe hear a lot about stress\nreduction techniques.\nAnd most all of the stress\nreduction techniques\nthat have been\nexplored, everything\nfrom massage to meditation\nto breathwork to a hot shower\nto a foot rub,\nwill calm you down.\nThe question is, do\nthey calm you down just\nduring that practice?\nGreat if it does.\nBut does it also translate\nto reduced levels\nof stress at other times\nin the 24-hour cycle\nand other positive\neffects as well?\nSo one physiological sigh\nis a very efficient way\nto adjust that ratio of\nsympathetic to parasympathetic\nactivation and immediately\nbring about calm.\nSo it's excellent for\nreal-time control of stress.\nThe other thing about\nphysiological sighs\nis that it's not a hack.\nIt's not the application of a\nbreathing practice to something\nthat it wasn't intended for.\nIn fact, physiological\nsighs were not\ndiscovered by me at all.\nThey were discovered\nby physiologists\nin the 1930s, who found that\nwhen people underbreathe,\nthey have a buildup of carbon\ndioxide in their system.\nAnd even though carbon\ndioxide is essential for life,\nyou don't want too much\nof it in your system.\nAnd that people, whether or\nnot they were asleep or awake,\nwould engage a physiological\nsigh spontaneously,\nsubconsciously.\nThey would do this double\ninhale through the nose\nand extended exhale\nthrough the mouth.\nAnd that did not just eliminate\nexcessive carbon dioxide\nfrom the system.\nIt also rebalanced the\noxygen-carbon dioxide ratio\nin the proper ways.\nIn fact, it's\nobserved in animals.\nYou might see this in\nanimals that are tired.\nWhen animals or\nhumans get tired,\nthey tend to start\nunderbreathing a little bit,\nand that can often disrupt\nthe balance of carbon dioxide\nand oxygen. And right\nbefore a dog will go down\nfor a nap, for instance,\nyou'll notice that it'll\ndo this double inhale, exhale.\npeople when they are sleeping,\nif they hold their breath\nfor a period of time,\nwhich, frankly, all of us\ndo periodically\nthroughout sleep,\nthey will engage a spontaneous\nphysiological sigh.\nDuring the daytime, we are often\nholding our breath, especially\nnowadays-- and there's\na study on this\nthat we'll talk about a\nlittle bit later-- where\nwhen people text message\nor they're emailing,\nalthough nowadays people are\nmainly on social media and text\nmessaging, they often\nare holding their breath.\nThey will follow a breath\nhold by a physiological sigh\nbecause during that\nbreath hold, they're\nbuilding up the level of\ncarbon dioxide in their system.\nNow, mind you, I spent\nclose to a half an hour\ntelling you that most people\nare overbreathing at rest,\nand that's also true.\nBut people often will\nshift from overbreathing\nto underbreathing, which\nis a terrible pattern.\nSo physiological sighs done\neither as a one-off, one\nphysiological sigh to clamp\nstress or reduce stress\nin real time, or repeatedly\nover five minutes as a practice\nthat you do each day is\ngoing to be not just the most\neffective way to\napproach reducing stress\naround the clock and in real\ntime but also the one that's\nhighly compatible with the\nway that the neural circuits\nthat control breathing\nwere designed.\nThe physiological sigh has some\nother very useful applications.\nOne of the more, I would say,\nuseful ones, at least to those\nof you that exercise,\nis going to be\nthe use of physiological\nsigh in order\nto remove the\nso-called side stitch.\nSo if you've ever been running\nor swimming or exercising\nand you felt a cramp\non your right side,\nchances are, despite what your\nhigh school PE coach told you,\nthat raising your\narms above your head\nor drinking less water\nbefore you exercise\nis not going to get\nrid of that cramp.\nAnd here's why.\nIt's not a cramp at all.\nIf you recall the cervical\n3, 4, and 5 nerves that\ngive rise to the phrenic nerve\nand go down and innervate\nyour diaphragm, well,\nas I mentioned before,\na certain number of\nthose nerve fibers\nactually course into the\ndiaphragm and go up underneath.\nAnd if you recall\nearlier, I also\nsaid that the diaphragm sits\nright on top of the liver.\nIn other words, you actually\nhave a sensory innervation\nof the diaphragm, the deep\ndiaphragm, and the liver.\nAnd there's something called\nreferenced pain, which\nis what people\ngenerally experience\nwhen they have that side stitch\non their right-hand side.\nSo if you're ever\nexercising and you\nfeel a cramp on your\nright-hand side,\nit's possible that\nit's a genuine cramp.\nBut more likely is the fact\nthat that phrenic nerve\nsensory innervation is now\nbeing carried up to your brain\nand you are detecting some local\nor referenced pain in the liver\nand in the diaphragm.\nNow, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean\nyou're doing anything wrong,\nalthough you might not\nbe breathing properly for\nrunning at that moment,\nand that's what gave rise to it.\nIt could be some spasming\nof the phrenic nerve\nor some inefficient\nbreathing during running.\nWe had an entire series on\nfitness with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nOne of those episodes\nincluded a lot of information\non breathing.\nIt was the episode on\nendurance, although breathing\nwas a topic that was thread\nthrough multiple episodes\nin that series.\nYou can find that series\nat HubermanLab.com.\nTalks a lot about how to\nbreathe during running,\nhow to breathe during\nweightlifting, et cetera.\nBut the point for now\nis that if ever you're\nexperiencing that\nright-side side stitch,\nI encourage you to perform\nthe physiological sigh.\nAnd the good news is you can\nperform it while still running\nor while still\nswimming, although I\nsuppose with swimming,\nyou might have\nto make some adjustments\nbecause, of course,\nyou don't want to inhale\nwater, or while cycling\nor any type of activity.\nIf you perform that\nphysiological sigh generally\ntwo or three times,\nwhat will occur\nis that because of\nchanges in the firing\nof the phrenic nerve, and in\nparticular because of changes\nin the sensory feedback\nfrom the sensory component\nof the phrenic nerve\nback to the brain,\nyou will experience an\nalleviation of the pain\nfrom that right-side\nside stitch.\nIn other words, you can\nget rid of side cramps\ndoing physiological\nsighs during activities,\nin particular during\nrunning activities.\nNow, I should also mention that\nif you're experiencing a side\nstitch on the\nleft-side, chances are\nthat has to do with excessive\nair or fluid in your stomach.\nAnd there are\nreasons for that that\nalso have to do with the way\nthat the phrenic nerve is--\nit's bilateral and\nbranches to both sides\nand is catching sensory input\non the left side from some\nof the local organs and sensory\ninnervation of those organs.\nBut if you have\nright-side side stitch,\nthe physiological\nsigh done two or three\ntimes while still running ought\nto relieve that side stitch.\nNow, as long as we're\ntalking about breathing\nand the phrenic nerve\nand the relationship\nbetween the phrenic nerve and\nyour liver and your stomach\nand some of the other\norgans in that neighborhood,\nwe should talk about the\nrelationship between breathing\nand heart rate.\nThis is an incredibly\nimportant topic,\nso much so that I perhaps\nshould have brought it up\nat the beginning of the episode.\nBut nonetheless, you now know\nwhat your diaphragm does.\nWhen you inhale, your\ndiaphragm moves down.\nThat's right.\nWhen you contract your\ndiaphragm, it moves down.\nIt creates space for\nyour lungs to inhale.\nAnd when you exhale,\nyour diaphragm moves up.\nWell, when you inhale and\nyour diaphragm moves down,\nwhat happens is there's\nmore space created\nin the thoracic cavity and\nparticularly if you're also\nbreathing deeply and you're\nusing those intercostal muscles\nto expand your ribs.\nAs a consequence,\nthe heart actually\ngets a little bit bigger.\nIt's a temporary\nenlargement in the heart.\nBut it's a real enlargement.\nAnd as a consequence,\nwhatever blood is in the heart\nis now in a larger volume\nbecause the heart got bigger.\nAnd as a consequence, that\nblood is moving more slowly\nthrough that larger volume\nfor a short period of time.\nBut nonetheless, it's\nmoving more slowly.\nYour nervous system detects\nthat and sends a neural signal\nto the heart to speed\nthe heart rate up.\nIn other words, inhales\nincrease heart rate.\nThe opposite is true\nwhen you exhale.\nWhen you exhale, your\ndiaphragm moves up.\nYour rib cage tends\nto move inward a bit.\nAnd you compact the heart.\nYou reduce the volume\nof the heart overall.\nWhen you reduce the volume\nof the heart overall,\nblood flow through\nthe heart accelerates\nbecause it's a smaller volume.\nSo a given unit\nof blood is going\nto move more quickly\nthrough that small volume.\nYour nervous system detects\nthat and sends a signal\nto slow the heart down.\nSo just as inhales\nspeed the heart up,\nexhales slow your\nheart rate down.\nNow, of course, even though\nyou can double up on inhales\nor even triple up on inhales,\nsooner or later, if you inhale,\nyou're going to have to exhale.\nAnd the converse is\nalso true, of course.\nSo what does this mean in terms\nof controlling your heart rate?\nWell, let's say you are\ngoing in for a blood draw,\nor you're going out on\nstage and you're stressed.\nWell, I would encourage you to\ndo a physiological sigh, maybe\ntwo physiological sighs to\nbring your level of calm up\nand your level of stress down.\nNonetheless, if\nyou have any reason\nwhy you want to quickly\nreduce your heart rate\nor accelerate your heart rate\nfor sake of physical work\noutput or to calm yourself\ndown additionally, not just use\nthe physiological\nsigh, well, then you\ncan take advantage of this\nrelationship between inhales\nand exhales\ncontrolling heart rate.\nIf you want to increase\nyour heart rate,\nyou can simply inhale\nlonger and more vigorously\nrelative to your exhales.\nAnd if you want to\ndecrease your heart rate,\nwell, then you're going to\nmake your exhales longer\nand/or more vigorous\nthan your inhales.\nIn fact, this process, which\nis called respiratory sinus\narrhythmia, is the basis of what\nwe call heart rate variability.\nHeart rate variability\ninvolves the vagus nerve,\nthe 10th cranial nerve, which\nis a parasympathetic nerve that\nis associated with\na calming aspect\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nslowing your heart rate down\nby extending your exhales.\nAnd it really forms the basis\nof most all breathing practices.\nIf you look at any\nbreathing practices,\nwhether or not it's Wim Hof\nbreathing, Tummo breathing,\nKundalini breathing,\nPranayama breathing,\nphysiological sighing, cyclic\nsighing, and on and on and on,\nif you were to measure the\nratio of inhales to exhales\nand the vigor of inhales to\nexhales, what you would find\nis that each one would create a\nnet increase or a net decrease\nin heart rate that could be very\naccurately predicted by whether\nor not that breathing practice\nemphasized inhales, emphasized\nexhales, or had those two\nfeatures, inhale and exhale,\nbe of equal duration\nand intensity.\nIn fact, if you wanted to\nequilibrate your heart rate,\nwhat you would do is you\nwould do box breathing\nbecause inhale,\nhold, exhale, hold\nis, by definition, creating\nequal duration inhales\nand exhales of essentially\nequivalent vigor.\nWhen you do a\nphysiological sigh,\nyou're doing two\nbig inhales, which\nis going the speed\nyour heart rate up\njust a little bit, but then\na long extended exhale.\nThe exhale in the end is much\nlonger than the two inhales\neven when combined.\nAnd so you get a net decrease in\nheart rate, the calming effect.\nAnd then practices such as Tummo\nbreathing or Wim Hof breathing\nor cyclic hyperventilation,\n[HYPERVENTILATES] deep inhales\nand exhales, the inhales\nare more vigorous compared\nto the more passive\nexhales-- are\ngoing to lead to\nincreases in heart rate.\nSo the relationship between\nbreathing and heart rate\nis an absolutely lockstep\none where your heart\nrate follows your breathing.\nYour heart rate\nand your breathing\nare in an intimate\ndiscussion with one another,\nbut where always and\nforever your inhales\nincrease your heart rate,\nyour exhales decrease it.\nNow, this feature,\nwhich physicians\ncall respiratory\nsinus arrhythmia,\nor we sometimes hear about more\noften nowadays as heart rate\nvariability, is something\nthat people in sport\nhave known about for\na very long time.\nIt's why, for instance, that\nmarksmen will exhale just prior\nto taking a shot.\nThat's particularly\ntrue for people\nthat compete in the biathlon,\nwhere they cross country ski.\nSo their heart rate\nis up, up, up, up, up.\nThen they'll get to the\npoint where they actually\nhave to shoot a target,\nand they'll exhale,\nand then they'll\nshoot the target.\nThis is also why, for instance,\nif you want to bring your heart\nrate down very quickly between\nrounds of martial arts,\nthere are a number of\ndifferent ways to do that.\nBut an extended exhale of any\nkind or, frankly, any breathing\npractice that emphasizes\nexhales is going\nto bring your heart rate down.\nThis has been incorporated in\na number of different contexts,\nincluding sport, military.\nIt's also now being incorporated\nin a clinical context\nfor people who feel a\npanic attack coming on.\nI'm very gratified to learn that\nthe physiological sigh is now\nbeing explored as a tool\nto prevent panic attacks\nand anxiety attacks.\nThis is prior to the\npanic attack, people\nbringing their heart\nrate down, again,\nthrough those extended exhales.\nSo learning to\nextend your exhale\nis really a terrific\nskill to master,\nand it's a very easy\nskill to master, frankly.\nWhy do I say a skill?\nWell, remember what\nI said earlier,\nwhich is that humans\ninhale actively\nand most typically\nwill passively exhale,\njust let the air [EXHALES] drop\nout of them at whatever rate,\ndepending on how much\nair they inhaled.\nActively exhaling, that is,\nactively relaxing the diaphragm\nand actively relaxing\nthose intercostal muscles\nof the chest, those ones\nthat are, I should say,\nbetween the ribs,\nis a skill that you\ncan very quickly\nacquire and will\nallow you to use\nthat relationship\nbetween the phrenic nerve,\nthe diaphragm, and the size\nof the heart, the heart\nvolume, and all that stuff\nto really take control\nof heart rate quickly.\nSo that if you feel like your\nheart is racing too much--\nand, frankly, a\nlot of people have\na lot of what's called\ninteroceptive awareness,\nespecially anxious people.\nThey can really\nsense what's going on\nin their body, other\npeople less so.\nLike, oh my god,\nmy heart's beating.\nIt's ready to jump out of my\nchest, and I don't like that.\nI don't like that.\n[EXHALES] Big, long exhale.\nIt doesn't matter if you do it\nthrough the nose or the mouth.\nBig, long exhale is\ngoing to allow you\nto slow your heart rate down.\nLet's talk about hiccups.\nEverybody experiences\nhiccups from time to time.\nI think most people would\nagree that one hiccup is\nsort of funny.\nTwo hiccups in a\nrow is really funny.\nAnd three hiccups\nin a row is where\nit starts to be concerning,\nin part because hiccups\ncan be kind of painful.\nYou can experience pain in\nyour gut or your lower abdomen\nand sometimes in\nyour chest as well.\nAnd it feels kind of intrusive.\nIt gets in the way of\nhaving conversation or just\nsitting there and relaxing.\nFortunately, there's a simple\nway to get rid of hiccups.\nAnd you can arrive at\nthat simple technique\nif you understand a\nlittle bit about what\ngives rise to hiccups.\nThe reason we get\nhiccups at all is\nbecause we experience a\nspasm of the phrenic nerve.\nThe phrenic nerve,\nas you recall,\nis a nerve that emanates\nfrom the cervical region,\nto be specific C3, 4, and 5.\nThose spinal nerves go down,\nof course, behind the heart\nand innervate the\ndiaphragm, which\nis the muscle that when it\ncontracts, it moves down\nand allows the lungs to fill.\nAnd then when you\nrelax the diaphragm,\nthen the diaphragm moves\nup, and the lungs shrink\nor they expel air,\nso-called exhalation.\nNow, the phrenic nerve also\nhas that sensory branch.\nSo it's not just involved\nin controlling the diaphragm\nat the motor level.\nIt's also sensing things\ndeep within the diaphragm\nand in the liver as well\nbecause the liver sits right\nbelow the diaphragm.\nSo a hiccup has that\npainful sensation from time\nto time because there's\na rapid sensory feedback\nor a signal, rather, of a\nsharp sensation of contraction\nwithin the diaphragm.\nAnd that's relayed\nback to the brain.\nAnd you consciously perceive\nthat as a little bit of pain.\nAnd then, of course, the\nhiccup is [HICCUPS] the hiccup,\nwhich is the spasming\nof the phrenic nerve\nthat you experience more\nor less in your throat.\nBut all this really is happening\nalong the phrenic nerve\nand toward the diaphragm.\nWhat this all means\nis that if you\ncan stop the phrenic nerve from\nspasming, you can stop hiccups.\nThere are a lot of\napproaches that people\nhave tried to take to eliminate\nspasming of the phrenic nerve.\nYou'll hear that breathing\ninto a bag, which\nis one way to reingest or\nreinhale carbon dioxide that\notherwise would be expelled out\ninto the environment, can help.\nThat's a very indirect method.\nIt rarely works, frankly,\nbecause it really\nhas to do more with\nadjusting your breathing\nto try and adjust the\nactivity of the phrenic nerve.\nIt's a really roundabout way\nof trying to alleviate hiccups.\nSome people will\nexperience relief\nfrom drinking from\na glass of water\nfrom the opposite\nside of the glass.\nSo you have to tilt\nover at the waist.\nIt's a kind of messy approach.\nAgain, it doesn't tend to\nwork a lot of the time.\nFor some people, it\nworks every time.\nBut for most people,\nit doesn't work at all.\nHowever, there is\na technique that\ncan reliably eliminate hiccups.\nAnd it's a technique that takes\nadvantage of hypercontracting\nthe phrenic nerve over\na short period of time\nso that it then subsequently\nrelaxes or alleviates\nthe spasming of\nthe phrenic nerve.\nAnd that simple method is to\ninhale three times in a row.\nThis is a very unusual\npattern of breathing.\nBut what it involves is\ntaking a big, deep inhale\nthrough your nose.\nThen before you exhale any\nair, take a second inhale\nthrough the nose, however\nbrief that inhale might be,\nand then a third even micro\nor millisecond long inhale\nthrough your nose to\nget that third inhale.\nAnd then hold your breath\nfor about 15 to 20 seconds,\nand then slowly exhale.\nSo even though I'm not\nexperiencing any hiccups\nright now.\nI will demonstrate the method\nfor eliminating hiccups\nso that you're all\nclear on how to do it.\nOK, here I go.\n[INHALES DEEPLY]\n[INHALES]\n[INHALES]\n[EXHALES]\nOK, so it's three inhales\nall through the nose.\nAnd it is true that that\nsecond and third inhale\ntakes some physical\neffort to really get\nadditional air into the\nlungs without exhaling first.\nIt feels like-- the only\nway I can describe it really\nis as a sharp second\nand third inhale\nbecause you really\nhave to engage\nthe musculature of those\nintercostal muscles\nand the diaphragm\nin order to do it.\nAnd then that long exhale can be\nthrough the nose or the mouth.\nBut I find it particularly\nrelaxing or even pleasant to do\nit through the nose.\nThis method of three inhales\nthrough the nose followed\nby a long exhale through\nthe nose or mouth\nwill eliminate hiccups right\naway because what it does\nis it hyperexcites the\nphrenic nerve three\ntimes in a row, a very unnatural\npattern for the phrenic nerve\nto fire.\nAnd then it undergoes\na hyperpolarization,\nas we call it, in which\nthe phrenic nerve actually\nstands a much lower probability\nof getting activated again\nfor some period of\ntime afterwards.\nSo it is important\nthat you try and return\nto normal cadence of breathing\nafter doing this three inhales\nfollowed by a long exhale.\nIf you need to perform\nit a second time in order\nto eliminate hiccups because\nthey're simply not going away,\nthat's fine.\nYou can do that.\nBut as far as we\nknow, this is the most\nefficient and science-supported\nway to eliminate hiccups.\nNow, up until now\nI've been talking\nabout breathing techniques,\nand I've mainly focused\non breathing techniques\nthat emphasize the exhale,\nwhether or not it's the\ncarbon dioxide tolerance\ntest, whether or not\nit's cyclic sighing\nor the physiological sigh\nthat you use in real time\nto reduce stress.\nOne thing that we haven't\ntalked about so much\nis cyclic hyperventilation.\nCyclic hyperventilation,\nas you recall,\nis a bout of 25 or\nso breaths inhaling\ndeeply through the nose and then\npassively exhaling or sometimes\nactively exhaling,\ntypically through the mouth.\nSo it might look like this.\n[HYPERVENTILATES] That's a very\nactive inhale through the nose\nand exhale through the mouth.\nIt can also be\ndone active inhale\nthrough the nose, passive exhale\nthrough the mouth, like so.\n[HYPERVENTILATING]\nIn any event, that pattern\nof breathing repeated\nfor 10 to 25 breaths\ngreatly increases\nlevels of autonomic arousal.\nIn fact, it's known to deploy\nadrenaline from the adrenals.\nAnd in our study, we had people\nthen expel all their air,\nso breathe out, hold their\nbreath for 15 to 30 seconds,\nand then repeat for a\nperiod of five minutes.\nThat did lead to some very\ninteresting and positive\nphysiological changes in\nterms of stress mitigation,\nalthough not as\nsignificant as was\nobserved with cyclic sighing,\nas I talked about earlier.\nNow, there is a lot of interest\nin cyclic hyperventilation\nfor sake of, for instance,\nextending breath holds.\nThis has become popular in part\nbecause of the so-called Wim\nHof method, which\nis a method that\ncombines breathing,\ncyclic hyperventilation,\nfollowed by lungs full or\nlungs empty breath holds,\ndepending on which variant\nof the Wim Hof method one\nis using.\nSeparately-- and I really\nwant to emphasize separately--\nthe Wim Hof method also\ninvolves deliberate\ncold exposure, which, as all\nof you know, I'm a big fan of\nand we've done episodes\nof this podcast on.\nAnd we have toolkits on\ndeliberate cold exposure\nfor increasing dopamine\nlevels, epinephrine levels,\nimmune system\nfunction, et cetera.\nWim Hof method also\nincorporates that.\nAnd it has a\nmindfulness component.\nI do want to caution\npeople that any time you're\ndoing cyclic\nhyperventilation, you\nwant to be very cautious about\nnot doing it in or near water\nbecause it does greatly increase\nthe risk of shallow water\nblackout.\nAnd that's because when you\ndo cyclic hyperventilation,\nyou are expelling, you're\nexhaling more carbon dioxide\nthan usual.\nAnd what I haven't told you yet\nis that the trigger to breathe\nis actually an increase\nin carbon dioxide.\nWhat I mean by that is\nyou have a small set\nof neurons in your\nbrainstem that\ncan detect when carbon dioxide\nlevels in your bloodstream\nreach a certain level.\nAnd when they reach that level,\nthey trigger the gasp reflex\nand/or the hunger for breathing.\nIn other words, we don't\nbreathe because we crave oxygen,\nalthough we do need oxygen,\nof course, in order to survive\nand for our brain to function\nand our bodily organs\nto function.\nBut our brain is wired such that\nit has a threat sensor, which\nis carbon dioxide levels\nare getting too high,\nand that's what triggers\nthe motor reflex to breathe\nand to, in some\ncases, gasp for air,\ndepending on how\nstarved for air we are.\nSo if you do cyclic\nhyperventilation,\nwhether or not\nit's Wim Hof method\nor whether or not\nit's Tummo method--\nagain, these things are similar.\nThey're not exactly the same.\nThere are other\nbreathing methods\nthat incorporate cyclic\nhyperventilation.\nWhat you're doing\nis you're getting\nrid of a lot of carbon\ndioxide, and therefore, you're\nremoving the impulse\nor lowering the impulse\nto breathe so that when you\nenter that breath hold phase\nafter the hyperventilation, it's\na much longer period of time\nbefore you feel the\nanxiety and the hunger\nand the impulse to breathe.\nThat's one of the real\nbenefits of any technique that\nincorporates cyclic\nhyperventilation,\nis that rather than reduce\nyour stress level in real time,\nit actually does the opposite.\nIt increases your stress level.\nIt increases your levels\nof autonomic arousal.\nBut you're doing\nit deliberately.\nAnd then during those breath\nholds, what's happening\nis you have a lot of\nadrenaline circulating\nin your system\nbecause of the way\nthat hyperventilation triggers\nthe release of adrenaline\nfrom your adrenal glands.\nIt also triggers the\nrelease of epinephrine,\nwhich is the same as\nadrenaline, from a little brain\narea called locus\ncoeruleus, which\nmakes you feel more alert.\nAnd then during\nthose breath holds\nand in the subsequent rounds\nof cyclic hyperventilation,\npeople experience what it is\nto have a lot of adrenaline\nin their system.\nBut they are\ncontrolling the release\nof that adrenaline, which is\nfar and away different than when\nlife events are triggering\nthat adrenaline.\nSo what it really is is a\nform of self-induced stress\ninoculation.\nAnd I do think\nthere are benefits\nto practicing cyclic\nhyperventilation because it\ndoes allow you to learn how\nto self-deploy adrenaline\nand epinephrine\nfrom locus coeruleus\nand from the adrenals.\nOr I got that\nbackwards-- adrenaline\nfrom your adrenals\nand epinephrine\nfrom locus coeruleus.\nAnd it allows you\nto explore what\nit is to maintain calm\nstate of mind and body\nwhen you have a\nlot of adrenaline\nin your system, which\ncertain studies are starting\nto show can allow people\nto be able to lean\ninto the stressful\naspects of life.\nAnd let's be honest, life\nis stressful in any event.\nAnd we're all going\nto experience stress\nat some point or another.\nAnd when we do, we\nwant to make sure\nthat we're not overtaken by\nthe release of adrenaline\nfrom the adrenals, that\nsudden surge of epinephrine\nfrom locus coeruleus.\nSo doing cyclic hyperventilation\nmaybe one or two\ntimes per week-- again,\n25 breaths, active inhale,\npassive or active exhale.\nDo expect to feel tingly because\nof that reduction in carbon\ndioxide from exhaling so much.\nDo expect to feel a\nlittle bit agitated.\nBe very careful\ndoing this if you're\nsomebody who has anxiety\nattacks or somebody who\nhas panic attacks or\ndisorders of any kind.\nBut if you don't and you\nwant to explore this,\nyou'll notice you start\nto feel really ramped up.\nAnd then during\nthe breath holds,\nwhich, again, can be done\nby exhaling and stopping\nfor some period of time,\n15, maybe even 60 seconds,\nis a time in which\nyou can explore\nhow to remain mentally calm.\nSome people even choose\nto do math problems\nor think of things in a\nkind of structured way\nwhile they have a lot of these\nhormone neurotransmitters\ncirculating at high levels in\ntheir system, in other words,\nas a way to learn to manage your\nmind and body under conditions\nof stress.\nNow, if you are somebody who's\nusing deliberate cold exposure,\neither cold showers or ice\nbaths or cold immersion,\nI often get asked\nhow best to breathe\nduring those different\ntypes of activities.\nReally, there's no\nbest way to breathe.\nAlthough if you wanted\nto turn those activities\ninto their own form\nof stress inoculation,\nagain, please don't use\ncyclic hyperventilation.\nThat's dangerous.\nI don't recommend it whatsoever.\nBut you can try to actively\nslow your breathing, that is,\nto make sure that you're\nengaging in rhythmic breathing.\nNow, up until now I've said\nthat rhythmic breathing is\nthe default.\nPre-Botzinger nucleus\ncontrolling rhythmic\nbreathing is the default\nand that doubling up\non inhales and exhales\nis something that happens when\nyou deliberately take over\nthe action of\npre-Botzinger complex.\nNow, that's true\n99% of the time.\nHowever, there are\ncertain conditions,\nsuch as conditions of heightened\nstate of emotional arousal--\nif you think about\nsomebody who's been crying,\noftentimes they'll\ndo the double inhale,\nexhale [INHALES SHAKILY]\nor triple inhales.\nOr if somebody is very, very\nafraid, it's all inhales.\nSo it does sometimes\nhappen spontaneously.\nActually, when we get\ninto very cold water,\nthere's a very robust\ndecrease in the activation\nof the prefrontal\ncortex, which is\nthe area of brain real estate\nright behind the forehead\nthat controls structured\nthinking, your ability\nto reason and make sense\nof what's going on.\nIf you get into\nreally cold water,\nyou should not expect that\nbrain region to work or at least\nnot work very well at all for\nthe first 20 or 30 seconds\nthat you're in the cold water.\nFrom the time you\nget into cold water,\nbecause here we're talking\nabout deliberate cold exposure,\nI encourage you to try\nand control your breathing\nand make it rhythmic, that is,\ninhales follow exhales follow\ninhales follow\nexhales, even if they\nhave to be fast inhale\nexhale, inhale, exhale.\nWhy?\nBecause the default when we get\ninto a stressful circumstance,\nemotionally or physically\nstressful circumstance,\nis that rhythmic breathing stops\nand that parafacial nucleus\ntakes over and it's\n[INHALES RAPIDLY],,\nand it's that kind\nof panicky mode.\nAnd by simply controlling\nour breath, again,\neven if it's fast\nfrom inhale to exhale\nand making sure that we're\nalternating inhales and exhales\nrhythmically-- and\nwhat you'll find\nis that you'll be\nable to navigate\nthat what would otherwise be\na very stressful circumstance\nand make it less stressful\nor maybe even pleasant.\nAnd that skill\ndefinitely translates\nto other aspects\nof life in which\nyou're hit square in the face\nwith something stressful.\nYou'll notice your breathing\nand your pattern of breathing\nswitching to multiple\ninhales or breath holding,\nessentially departing\nfrom rhythmic breathing.\nAnd by quickly returning\nto rhythmic breathing\nand maybe even trying\nto slow the breathing\nand extend those exhales,\nyou'll find that you\ncan very quickly calm down.\nNext, I'd like to discuss what\nI find to be an absolutely\nfascinating topic.\nIt's also one that's highly\nuseful in the world, which\nis how your specific\npatterns of breathing\nrelate to your ability to learn\nand to remember information,\nhow it can modulate fear,\nand a number of other aspects\nof how your brain functions.\nThis is a literature that's\nbeen reviewed recently\nin a lot of exquisite\ndetail in a beautiful review\nby Jack Feldman, who\nI mentioned earlier,\none of the pioneers of the\nneuroscience of breathing.\nThe title of the review is\n\"Breathing Rhythm and Pattern\nand Their Influence on Emotion.\"\nAgain we'll, provide a link\nto this review in the show\nnote captions.\nThis review includes discussion\nof several studies, one\nin particular that I'll get\ninto in a bit of detail,\nthat describes the following.\nRight now, I just want\nyou to breathe regularly,\nmeaning rhythmically.\nYou can inhale and\nexhale through your mouth\nor through your nose.\nI'd prefer that you do\nit through your nose\nbecause nasal\nbreathing, unless you\nneed to breathe through your\nmouth because of hard exercise\nor eating or talking,\nis always going\nto be the better way to go.\nNasal breathing improves\nthe aesthetic of your face.\nThat's been shown.\nWe'll talk about that just\nbriefly in a few minutes.\nNasal breathing\nimproves the amount\nof oxygen you can\nbring into your system,\net cetera, et cetera.\nOK, so just breathe.\nInhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.\nAnd know that\nduring your exhales,\nyour pupil, that is, the pupil\nof your eye, is getting bigger.\nAnd as you exhale,\nit's getting smaller.\nIn addition, when you inhale,\nyour reaction time to anything\nthat happens around you-- a\ncar swerving in front of you,\nsomething that you might detect\nin the periphery of your vision\nor hear off in the distance--\nincreases significantly compared\nto when you're exhaling.\nIn addition, when\nyou are inhaling,\nyour ability to remember\nthings, especially\nthings that take a bit\nof effort to remember,\nand your ability to\nlearn new information\nis significantly greater than\nit is when you're exhaling.\nNow, as you hear all that,\nyou're probably thinking, OK,\nhow do I just inhale?\nWell, of course, that's not\ngoing to be the best approach.\nYou need to exhale as well\nfor all the reasons you now\nare well aware of.\nBut what these findings\nreally illustrate--\nand I should mention\nthese findings\nare all carried out in humans.\nSo these relate to some\nstuff in animal studies.\nBut what I just described has\nbeen shown in human studies\nconsistently.\nWhen we inhale\nand, in particular,\nwhen we inhale through\nour nose, our brain\nis not functioning in the\nsame way as when we exhale.\nNow, that doesn't\nmean that our brain\nis functioning in a\ndeficient way when we exhale.\nIt just doesn't function\nas well as it relates\nto memory retrieval,\nmemory formation,\nand some other\naspects of cognition.\nNow, you might be asking, why\nin the world would this be?\nWell, I wasn't consulted\nat the design phase,\nand anyone that tells\nyou that they were you\nshould back away from quickly.\nBut one reasonable explanation\nfor why our brain functions\nbetter, at least in the context\nof what I just talked about,\nwhen we inhale is because the\nolfactory system is actually\nthe most ancient sensory system\nof all the sensory systems we\nhave.\nSo before vision, before\naudition, before touch,\nbefore all of that,\nthe olfactory system\nis the most ancient system.\nAnd the olfactory\nsystem, of course,\nis designed to detect\nchemicals in the environment.\nAnd so if you imagine\nan early organism\nthat perhaps we evolved\nfrom or perhaps we\ndidn't but nonetheless\nthat we share\nsome features of, at least in\nterms of olfactory function,\nin order to get that chemical\ninformation into the brain,\nyou need to inhale.\nYou need to bring\nthat information in.\nNow, for aquatic animals, they\ncould take it in through water.\nBut for animals that are\nterrestrial that live on land,\nthey would have to get\nit through the air.\nSo inhalation, we know,\nactivates certain regions\nof the so-called\npiriformis cortex.\nThese are areas of the\nneocortex that are more ancient,\nas well as increasing\nthe activity of brain\nareas such as the hippocampus,\nwhich is a brain area involved\nin learning and memory.\nIn fact, one of the studies\nthat illustrates this most\nbeautifully is a study\nthat was published\nin The Journal of\nNeuroscience in 2016.\nBy the way, Journal\nof Neuroscience\nis a very fine journal.\nAnd the title of this paper\nis \"Nasal Respiration Entrains\nHuman Limbic Oscillations and\nModulates Cognitive Function.\"\nThis is a paper that followed\nup on an earlier paper that\nshowed that when people\nbreathe in through their nose,\ntheir recognition and\ntheir discrimination\nof different odors was far\ngreater than when they breathe\nin through their mouth.\nNow, that result\nwas interesting,\nbut it was also sort of a\nduh because you smell things\nwith your nose, not your mouth.\nYou taste things\nwith your mouth,\nand you speak with\nyour mouth, and there\nare bunch of other things\nyou can do with your mouth.\nBut nonetheless, that\nstudy pointed to the idea\nthat the brain is different\nduring nasal inhalations\nversus nasal\nexhalations versus mouth\ninhalations versus exhalations.\nWhat it basically showed\nis that the brain ramps up\nits levels of activity,\nand that signal to noise\nthat we talked about\nearlier, if you recall,\nthat ability for the\nbrain to detect things\nin the environment, is\nincreased during inhalations.\nBut because that earlier study\nfocused on smell, on olfaction,\nthere was a bit of\na confound there.\nIt was hard to separate\nout the variables.\nSo this paper, the one I just\nmentioned, \"Nasal Respiration\nEntrains Human and Limbic\nOscillations and Modulates\nCognitive Function,\" did not\nlook at detection of odors.\nRather, it looked at things\nlike reaction time or fear.\nAnd basically, what it found is\nthat reaction time is greatly\nreduced when people\nare inhaling.\nSo they had people look\nat fearful stimuli.\nThey looked at their reaction\ntime to fearful stimuli,\nin other words, their\nability to detect\ncertain kinds of stimuli.\nAnd they were given a lot of\ndifferent kinds of stimuli.\nSo they had to be able to\ndiscriminate between one\nsort of-- oops, excuse me.\nBy the way, folks,\nfor those listening,\nI just bumped the microphone,\ngetting rather animated here.\nWhat the subjects\nhad to do was detect\none type of stimulus\nversus another stimulus\nthat they were being exposed to.\nAnd what they found is\nif people were inhaling\nas that fear-inducing stimulus\nwas presented, their reaction\ntime to notice it was\nmuch, much faster.\nAnd they related that to\npatterns of brain activity,\nand they were able to do that\nbecause they were actually\nrecording from\nthe brain directly\nfrom beneath the skull.\nAnd they were able to\ndo that because they\nhad some patients that had\nintracranial electrodes\nembedded in their brain\nfor sake of trying\nto detect epileptic seizures.\nSo there's a lot to\nthis study and a lot\nthat we could discuss.\nBut the basic takeaway is\nthat when people are inhaling,\nthat is, when\nthey're drawing air\nin through their\nnose in particular,\ntheir ability to\ndetect what's going\non in the world\naround them is greatly\nenhanced and not just\nfor fear but also\nfor surprise of all sorts.\nSo when people are\ninhaling, their ability\nto detect novel stimuli,\nthings that are unexpected\nor that are unusual\nin their environment,\nis significantly increased.\nAgain, we'll put a link\nto this study as well.\nI find it to be one of the\nmore interesting studies\nin this realm, although there\nare now many additional studies\nthat support this\nstatement that I\nmade earlier, which is\nthat during inhalation,\nalso called\ninspiration, there are\na number of very fast\nphysiological changes,\nsuch as changes\nin pupil diameter,\nchanges in the activity\nof the hippocampus,\nthis memory encoding and\nretrieval area of the brain,\nand other areas of the brain.\nSo what's the tool\ntakeaway from this?\nIf you are sitting down to read\nor research or study or you\nreally want to learn\nsome information--\nmaybe you're listening to a\npodcast or some other sorts\nof information that\nyou want to retain--\nit actually makes\nsense to increase\nthe duration or the intensity\nof your inhales as you do that.\nThe more that you're inhaling\nrelative to exhaling in terms\nof duration, the more that\nyour brain is in this focused\nmode and this mode of being\nable to access and retrieve\ninformation better.\nNow, there's one\ncaveat to this that I\nthink is important because\nI know a number of people\nlisten to this podcast\nfor sake of gleaning tools\nnot just for\ncognitive enhancement\nbut for physical enhancement.\nIt turns out that when\nyou are inhaling air,\nyou're actually less\nable or, I should say,\nless efficient at generating\nvoluntary movements.\nNow, that might\ncome as a surprise.\nUp until now, we've basically\nbeen talking about inhalation\nis great, almost to the\npoint where you wonder like,\nis the exhalation\ngood for anything?\nYou don't want to overbreathe\nand kick out too much carbon\ndioxide.\nWell, of course exhalation\nis great for things.\nIn fact, if you're somebody\nthat's played baseball\nor softball, what are you told?\nThat you should\nexhale on the swing\nto generate the maximum\namount of power.\nIf you're somebody who has\ndone martial arts of any kind,\nwas traditional Western\nboxing, as you strike,\nthat's where people\ntypically do the hiya,\nlaying the sort of\nclassic karate type thing.\nThat's more of a movie thing.\nI don't know whether or not\npeople actually use the hiya.\nBut in boxing, oftentimes people\nwill do [EXHALES SHARPLY]..\nThey'll do a rapid exhalation,\na forceful exhalation,\nkeeping in mind, again, that\ninhales typically are active.\nThey engage the\ndiaphragmatic muscle.\nThey engage those\nintercostal muscles.\nWhereas exhales\ntend to be passive\nunless we take active\ncontrol of the exhale.\nAnd, indeed, our\nability to generate\nfast, directed, so-called\nvolitional, voluntary movements\nis greatly enhanced if we do\nthem during the exhale, not\nthe inhale.\nNow, with all of that\nsaid, I haven't yet\nreally talked about mouth\nversus nasal breathing.\nAnd it really can be a\nfairly short discussion\nbecause what abundant data now\nshow and has been beautifully\ndescribed in the book called\nJaws, A Hidden Epidemic--\nthis is a book that was written\nby Paul Ehrlich and Sandra\nKahn, my colleagues at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nIt has an introduction and a\nforeword from Jared Diamond\nand from the great\nRobert Sapolsky.\nSo some real heavy\nhitters on this book.\nWhat that book\nreally describes is\nthat whenever possible,\nmeaning unless you're\nspeaking or eating or you're\nexercising or other activities\nrequire some change in\nyour pattern of breathing,\nwe should really all be striving\nto breathe through our nose,\nnot through our mouth.\nAnd that relates\nto the increased\nresistance to breathing\nthrough the nose\nwe talked about earlier.\nAgain, I'll say it a third\ntime, that increased resistance\nthrough the nose allows you to\ninflate your lungs more, not\nless.\nThe other thing that\nbreathing through your nose\nallows you to do is it both\nwarms and moisturizes the air\nthat you bring into\nyour lungs, which\nis more favorable\nfor lung health\nthan breathing\nthrough the mouth.\nHard breathing through\nthe mouth or simply\nmouth breathing at all is\nactually quite damaging\nor can be, I should\nsay, quite damaging\nto some of the respiratory\nfunctions of your lungs.\nThat, of course, does not mean\nthat you shouldn't breathe hard\nthrough your mouth when\nyou're running or sprinting\nor exercising hard.\nBut you don't want\nmouth breathing\nto be the chronic default\npattern that you follow.\nNasal breathing is\nthe best pattern\nof breathing to follow\nas a default state.\nAnother aspect of\nnasal breathing\nthat's really beneficial is\nthat the gas nitric oxide\nis actually created\nin the nasal passages.\nIt's a gas that can\ncause relaxation\nof the smooth muscles that\nrelate to the vasculature not\njust of your nose\nbut of your brain\nand for all the\ntissues of your body.\nThis is why nasal breathing\nand not mouth breathing\nis great for when you want\nto relieve congestion.\nSo a lot of these things\nseem counterintuitive.\nYour nose is stuffed.\nSo that mainly makes people\nbreathe through their mouth.\nBut it turns out that\nbreathing through your nose\nwill allow some dilation of the\nvasculature, more blood flow,\ndilation of the nasal passages,\nand delivery of nitric oxide\nto all the tissues of your body.\nAnd that dilation of\nthe small capillaries\nthat innervate essentially\nevery organ of your body\nallow the delivery\nof more nutrients\nand the removal of carbon\ndioxide and other waste\nproducts from those\ntissues more readily\nthan if you're not\ngetting enough--\nexcuse me-- nitric\noxide into your system.\nSo a lot of reasons to\nbe a nasal breather.\nIf you want to check out that\nbook Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic,\nit's a terrific read.\nAnd it also shows some\nabsolutely striking pictures,\ntwin studies and so\nforth, and some before\nand afters of people and\nthe aesthetic changes\nthat they experienced when\nthey shifted from being a mouth\nbreather to a nose breather.\nThese are striking\nexamples that have been\nobserved over and over again.\nWhen people mouth\nbreath, there's\nan elongation of the jaw,\ndrooping of the eyelids,\nand the entire jaw\nstructure really\nchanges in ways that are\nnot aesthetically favorable.\nFortunately, when people switch\nto becoming nasal breathers--\nand, of course, that\ntakes some encouragement\neither by mouth taping or doing\ntheir cardiovascular exercise\nwith mouth closed or by\ndoing the sorts of exercises\nthat we talked about earlier.\nWhen they switch to becoming\nnasal breathers by default,\nthe aesthetic changes that\noccur are very dramatic\nand very favorable,\nincluding elevation\nof the eyebrows, not\nin an artificial sense\nor in a kind of outrageous\nway, but elevation\nof the cheekbones,\nsharpening of the jaw,\nand, most notably, improvements\nof the teeth and the entire jaw\nstructure.\nIn fact, one simple\ntest of whether or not\nyou can be an efficient\nnasal breather\nand whether or not you've been\nnasal breathing efficiently\nor most of the time in the\npast or whether or not you've\nbeen relying more on\nmouth breathing that\nwas described in\nthe book Jaws is\nyou should be able\nto close your mouth\nand breathe only\nthrough your nose.\nAgain, this is at rest, not\nduring exercise necessarily,\nthough you might do\nit during exercise.\nBut close your mouth,\nput your tongue,\non the roof of\nyour mouth, and it\nshould fit behind your teeth.\nAnd you should be able to\nnose breathe in that position.\nNow, many people won't\nbe able to do that.\nBut fortunately, as\nI mentioned earlier,\nif you nasal breathe, that is,\nyou deliberately nasal breathe\nwhen at rest for\nsome period of time,\nyou will experience an increased\nability to nasal breathe.\nAnd you should also experience\nsome addition of space\nwithin the palate of your\nmouth to allow your tongue\nto sit more completely on\nthe roof of your mouth.\nThis is especially\ntrue for children\nthat perform this technique.\nAgain, I refer you to the\nbook Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.\nIt's an absolutely\nspectacular book.\nYou can also just look online\n\"before and after Jaws, Hidden\nEpidemic\" and look at\nsome of the changes\nin facial structure\nthat occur when people\nmove from mouth to\nnasal breathing,\nand it's really quite striking.\nSo during today's\nepisode, per always, we\ncovered a lot of information.\nFirst, we talked about\nthe mechanical aspects\nof breathing-- the lungs, the\ndiaphragm, the trachea, and so\nforth.\nWe also talked about the\nchemical aspects of breathing,\nthat really breathing is\na way that we bring oxygen\nto our cells and that we\nget the correct levels\nor, I should say, we maintain\nthe correct levels of carbon\ndioxide in our system, neither\ntoo much nor too little,\nin order to allow\noxygen to do its magic\nand to allow carbon\ndioxide to do its magic.\nBecause as you learned\nduring today's episode,\ncarbon dioxide is not\njust a waste byproduct.\nIt has very critical\nphysiological functions.\nYou need to have\nenough of it around.\nAnd therefore, you don't want\nto overbreathe, especially\nat rest.\nWe talked about\na tool to measure\nhow well you manage carbon\ndioxide, the so-called carbon\ndioxide tolerance test,\nand various exercises\nthat you can use\nsimply by breathing\nto decrease your\nstress in real time,\ndecrease your stress\nchronically around the clock.\nObviously, that's a good thing--\nimprove sleep, improve mood.\nHow to increase\nbreath hold times\nand why you might\nwant to do that.\nAlso how to eliminate hiccups.\nWe talked about how\nto breathe in order\nto eliminate the\nside stitch or side\ncramp that you might\nexperience during exercise\nand how to breathe in\norder to improve learning\nand memory, reaction time,\nand various other aspects\nof cognitive and\nphysical function.\nI do realize it's a\nlot of information.\nBut as always, I\ntry and give you\ninformation that is clear,\nhopefully interesting as well,\nand actionable toward a\nnumber of different endpoints.\nSo if you're somebody\nthat's just now starting\nto think about the\napplication of breathwork,\nI would encourage you to please,\nyes, do that carbon dioxide\ntolerance test.\nThat will give you some\nwindow into how well\nor how poorly you're\nmanaging breathing.\nAnd then here's the great news.\nThe great news is\nthat breathwork,\nthat is, deliberate\nrespiration practices,\nare very effective at\ncreating change very quickly.\nIn some cases, such as the\nuse of the physiological sigh\nor cyclic hyperventilation,\nthose changes\ncan be experienced the\nfirst time and every time\nbecause, again,\nthese are not hacks.\nThese are aspects of\nyour breathing apparati,\nincluding the mechanical\nstuff and the neural stuff\nand the gas exchange stuff,\nall of which you were born with\nand that are available\nto you at any moment.\nSo all you really have to do\nis explore them and deploy them\nas you feel necessary.\nIf you're

Huberman Lab podcast,\nplease put those in the\ncomment section on YouTube.\nI do read all the comments.\nPlease also check\nout the sponsors\nmentioned at the beginning and\nthroughout today's episode.\nThat's the best way to\nsupport this podcast.\nNot so much on today's episode,\nbut on many previous episodes\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\nwe discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive tremendous\nbenefit from them for things\nlike improving sleep, hormone\nfunction, cognitive function,\nand so on.\nThe Huberman Lab\npodcast is now partnered\nwith Momentous supplements.\nWe've done that for\nseveral reasons.\nFirst of all,\nMomentous supplements\nare of the very highest quality.\nSecond of all,\nMomentous supplements\ntend to center around single\ningredient formulations.\nThis is incredibly important.\nBecause if you're going\nto include supplements\nin your daily\nregimen, you're going\nto want to use the\nright supplements\nin the right\ndosages, and you want\nto do that in the most\nbiologically and cost effective\nway.\nAnd single ingredient\nformulations\nare the only way that you\ncan determine what works\nand what doesn't work\nfor you, and it's\nthe only way in which you can\nadjust the dosage of given\nsupplements or maybe even\nalternate days that you take\none and not the other in a\nway that really allows you\nto home in on which\nsupplements are going\nto be ideal for your\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAlso, Momentous supplements\nship internationally.\nAnd that's great because\nwe know a number of you\nreside outside of\nthe United States.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements discussed\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nyou can go to live momentous,\nspelled O-U-S, so\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing us on social media,\nwe are HubermanLab on\nInstagram, Twitter, Facebook,\nand LinkedIn.\nAnd I should mention that\non all those platforms,\nI discuss science and\nscience-related tools, some\nof which overlap with the\ncontents of the Huberman Lab\npodcast, but much of which\nis distinct from the content\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\nAgain, it's HubermanLab on\nall social media platforms.\nAnd if you haven't already\nsubscribed to our Neural\nNetwork newsletter, it is a\nzero cost monthly newsletter\nin which we give a summaries of\npodcast episodes and toolkits--\nfor instance, toolkit\nfor sleep, toolkit\nfor managing dopamine, toolkit\nfor deliberate cold exposure.\nAgain, it's all zero\ncost to sign up.\nYou simply go to\nHubermanLab.com,\ngo to the Menu function,\nscroll down to Newsletter,\nand you supply your email.\nWe do not share your\nemail with anybody else.\nAnd there are also some\nexample newsletters\nthere at HubermanLab.com\nfor you to explore.\nOnce again, I'd like to thank\nyou for today's discussion\nall about the biology and\napplication of breathing.\nAnd last but\ncertainly not least,\nthank you for your\ninterest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
