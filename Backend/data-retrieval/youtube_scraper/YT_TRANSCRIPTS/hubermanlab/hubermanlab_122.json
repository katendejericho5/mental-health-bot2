    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the huberman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine today's\nepisode is the fifth in a six episode\nseries on fitness exercise and\nperformance and today's episode is all\nabout recovery that is how to maximize\nyour recovery to achieve your fitness\nand exercise and performance goals and\nhow to avoid over training Dr Andy\nGalpin\ngreat to be back\ntoday we're discussing recovery and I'm\nvery excited to have this discussion\nbecause as we know despite the fact that\ndifferent types of exercise can be used\nto trigger different types of adaptation\nsuch as increased long distance\nendurance\nanaerobic capacity strength hypertrophy\nEtc\nthe workouts themselves are not actually\nwhen the progress occurs when the\nadaptation occurs and this to me is\nextremely interesting because it\nparallels what we see with so-called\nneuroplasticity which is the nervous\nsystem's ability to change in response\nto experience we sit down to learn\nsomething\nwe experience something\nand that is the trigger for rewiring of\nthe nervous system but the actual\nrewiring occurs away from the experience\nor the learning\nso too in Fitness and in exercise\nrecovery is where the Real Results\nactually emerge where we get better\nso I'd love for you to explain what\nrecovery really is\nand the different types of recovery\ncertainly different ways to enhance\nrecovery and I'd also love for you to\nexplain whether or not there are ways\nthat people can become better at\nrecovering because if indeed recovery is\nwhen progress emerges when we get better\nwell then anything that supports our\nrecovery and gets us better at\nrecovering\nought to increase our rate and our\ndegree of progress absolutely you nailed\nit in the description what people really\nwant is some sort of change whether you\nare talking athletes or general\npopulation this change is uh some sort\nof improvement in muscle function\nreduction in body fat\nhigher functioning metabolism whatever\nthe case is and the only way that\nhappens is\nwe talk about the equation of stress\ncauses adaptation but as you alluded to\nthe piece in the middle is only if you\ncan recover from it and so the game\nwe're playing here is we all agree we\nwant more adaptation that means we need\nto bring more stress into the system but\nwe then have to ensure that our recovery\noutpaces\nthe stress input or else no adaptation\nwill occur in fact what happens is you\nwill actually be in a negative spot and\nstart going backwards and so what I\nwould love to do is is talk about how\nwe've handled this and I've had a decent\namount of experience here I was\nfortunate enough to do my master's\ndegree in the laboratory of a gentleman\nnamed Andy Frye who's an nsca Lifetime\nAchievement Award winner and he studied\nin large part recovery over training\noveruse overload in a lot of areas in\naddition I've been fortunate enough to\nwork with individuals from high\nfunctioning CEOs and Executives who have\nlittle time for Recovery High job stress\nto in to athletes uh and they think of\nthe example of pitchers in Major League\nBaseball who have to recover in a matter\nof four days that they can pitch again\nat maximum velocity so I would love to\noutline some of the tools and tactics\nstrategies that we use for all these\nindividuals give you some foundational\nstuff and I would love to maybe actually\ncover some things that most people have\nnever heard of some stuff you may not\nhave access to some technologies that we\nuse some biomarkers and then even a\nwhole bunch of things that are keeping\nwith the theme of your show here cost\nfree or extremely low cost so all those\nstrategies what I'd also like to do is\ncover nutrition and supplementation and\nfueling and hydration and things but\nthat's probably going to have to be\nsaved for an additional conversation\nthat we'll do in the next episode yes so\nwe will absolutely hold a conversation\nabout nutrition and supplementation\nwhere you can educate us about all the\ntop Contour stuff all the way down to\nthe the fine details\nI do have a question about recovery and\nit's one that I think most people are\nfamiliar with themselves\nwhich is soreness\nwe think of it as a muscle soreness but\nI was trained early on in my scientific\ncareer to always question the\nseemingly obvious so a couple of\nquestions about soreness first of all\nwhat does soreness really reflect\nis it really muscle soreness\nit feels like it's in the muscles but\nwhat other organ systems and tissues and\ncell types does it involve and then I'm\nparticularly interested in this concept\nor this experience that many of us\nincluding myself\nhad which is delayed onset muscle\nsoreness why would it be that when we\nare less in shape or when we perform a\nmovement that is extremely novel to us\nthe soreness seems to arrive after\na reasonable delay of maybe even a day\nyou know we're fine the next day but\nthen 48 hours later we are exceedingly\nsore\nand as we get more fit or more familiar\nwith the movement the soreness seems to\narrive earlier so I realized I just\nasked you about three questions or more\nfirst of all what is muscle soreness\nat a seller level which sells which\norgan systems and so forth what is it\nmean if we are sore is something I know\nwe'll get into a little bit later and\nthen why the delayed onset muscle\nsoreness it's actually one question so\nit's totally fine you answered all you\nasked all three because I'm going to\nactually answer number three which will\nanswer number two which will actually\nanswer number one\nI'd love to tell you that I set it up\nthat way intentionally but uh I'm just\nhappy to hear that where I was unable to\nbe concise you are able to be concise\nthank you\nwe are still learning a lot about this\narea it's actually really difficult to\nperform these studies anytime you ask a\nquestion about something like pain\nor soreness you're immediately talking\nabout perception\nand there is obviously a physical\ncomponent to that and there's also\nperception and so teasing those things\nout is extraordinarily challenging that\nsaid there has been a lot of work in\nthis area in fact probably um you may\nhave a show already out on pain or maybe\none's coming down the road we did an\nepisode on pain uh a while ago but it's\ndefinitely time to revisit that\nliterature I also have some amazing\ncolleagues at Stanford who work on pain\nboth from the uh cellular molecular side\nbut also from the psychological side\nabout how our understanding of pain and\nwhat we believe about pain shapes the\nexperience of pain and Pain Relief\namazing that's that stuff is incredibly\nimportant and I'm glad we flagged that\nand maybe we'll just call that good for\nnow they could come back later for\nanother one of your shows so that being\nsaid\nwhy does it happen uh 28 to 48 hours\nafter you exercise well that actually\nshould give you some Clues into what's\nhappening so the traditional dogma of\ndelayed onset muscle soreness is what\nthis is called is that it is a result of\nquote unquote micro tears and the muscle\nand so you can sort of think I challenge\nthe muscle there was some small tears in\nthere and I'm feeling the results of\nthat well in fact that certainly does\nhappen and it can happen that is not\nwhat's explaining your muscle soreness\nand in fact you can be quite sore\nfrom exercise and have no measurable\namount of muscle damage\nand so much like anything else when\nwe're in this idea of pain it's not a\none-to-one\nexplanation there are multiple factors\nthat are probably causing your\nperception of pain muscle damage\ncan be one of them it is not the only\none and it is probably in my opinion\nthough this has yet to be shown\ndefinitively\nprobably not even the leading cause of\nit and so what's actually happening well\nthe reason is taking you 24 to 48 hours\nis you can actually find various papers\nliterature reviews dating back in a\nnumber of years now over a decade that\nshow these wonderful curves of an\ninflammatory and immune response and we\ndon't need to necessarily go through the\nentire physiology right now but\neffectively what's happening is those\nthings have a little bit of a time delay\nand so some of those steps happen\nimmediately like right when the exercise\nis there and then some of them are\ndelayed six to 24 to 48 hours if you\nknow a little bit about this physiology\nit's you have a combination of\nneutrophils and macrophages and a bunch\nof things happening and this has a Time\nsequence so what happens is by the time\nwe get to this 28 to 48 hour window\nnow the muscle soreness kicks in\nwhich wait a minute if I if this was a\nresult of my muscles being torn\nand that happened immediately\nwouldn't that pain start immediately\nwell the answer is it would and so that\nthat is your first clue that that's not\nresponsible for it when we look at that\nimmune response and we see that that is\nactually Peak 24 to 48 hours later\nand then that's the same time the pain\nkicked in that's cooling you with the\nproblem so we have this immune response\nhappening in inflammation then all of a\nsudden we start getting fluid\naccumulation and now there are what are\ncalled nociceptors and you're probably\nvery obviously you're very familiar with\nthese and these are pain receptors\nwhat's actually interesting is we don't\nnecessarily know\na lot of information about how many pain\nreceptors are in muscle\nthey're not really in the belly in fact\nthis is why I can perform my muscle\nbiopsies and they don't really hurt you\nmean in the belly of the muscle correct\nyeah we do have pressure sensors though\nand so if you change the volume of the\ntissue you will respond to that very\nvery quickly so by enhancing swelling in\nthe actual muscle that is immediately\nputting pressure\non those pressure receptors if you will\nthat's the signal so what's probably\nhappening here and I just I just hate to\ngive you another bone but a lot of\ndelayed on some muscle soreness is\nprobably just a neural feedback loop\nrather than it is actual muscle damage\nyeah it makes a lot of sense there's a\nlot of interactions between the types of\nneurons that control\ntouch sensation and pain sensation and\nitch sensation in fact a lot of people\num kind of collapse itch and pain\ntogether Bingo yeah you know that's\nsomething it's painful and it itches is\na familiar thing for people mosquito\nbites and such\num and of course there's the classic\ngait theory of pain yeah which uh people\nwill be familiar with and then I'll\nexplain why I'm explaining this\num which is if you you something hurts\nyou know you Bonk your knee or you stub\nyour toe we tend to grab that body part\nand try and rub it totally and that\nrubbing is not a coincidental thing it\nactivates a set of uh touch sensors that\nare that respond to kind of broad dull\ntouch\num and that actively inhibits through\nthe release of an inhibitory\nneurotransmitter the fibers that control\nthe pain signal so anytime we rub a you\nknow like a charlie horse our leg or we\nor we stub our toe and we you know we\nwince and then we grab the tone we got\nlike squeezing it a little bit that's\nactually deactivating or partially\ninactivating the the pain mechanism so\nthe idea that uh a swelling response\nwould then trigger a neural response\nthat then would recruit the pain\nreceptor response here I'm using broad\nbroad brush\num Strokes here to explain this\num makes very good sense to me\num now and only now that you've\nexplained how this process works I can\nactually even add more to that so\nif you remember how muscles work so we\nhave to have some sort of signal from\nthe nervous system that has to actually\ngo in and tell the muscle to contract\nwell remember there are a few episodes\nago we covered the physiology here of\nwhat's called a motor unit\nokay well what I didn't explain to you\nare called muscle spindles\nand we have talked about proprioception\nin an episode of before as well but we\nnever tied this picture together so let\nme walk you through that really quickly\nand it's going to tie this Loop into a\nnice bow so what happens is\num this motor unit is is coming in from\nwhat's called an alpha motor unit and\nthat's going to be innervating your\nmuscle fibers and that's going to tell\nthe muscle fibers to contract those are\ntypically spread out throughout the uh\nall sides of the muscle in interior\nexterior all over on the outside though\nthere is another type of muscle called a\nmuscle spindle now these are\nnon-contractiles so they don't have that\nactin and myosin and they don't produce\nForce they are responsive they are\nproprioceptive so what that means is\nthey sense stretch and this is why for\nexample if you were to stretch a\nhamstring and stretch any muscle group\nit doesn't really matter or muscle\nits innate response is to fire back to\nclose that distance and this is what\nkeeps you from say if you're leaning to\nthe right\nyou can imagine that the example we give\nis if you're if you're standing on one\nfoot\nand you start swaying to the right\nall right let's say you're standing on\nyour right foot and this makes this\neasier for folks and you start swaying\nto the right like you're going to fall\non your right ear will hit the ground\nthe inside of your right calf muscle\nwill start being stretched the outside\nwill start being compressed right so the\nstretch on the inside of the right calf\nmuscle will sense that stretch and it\nwill respond by Contracting that pulls\nyou back to the middle and stops you\nfrom falling that's proprioception and\nmuscle spindles sense stretch and tell\nyou to contract the way that they work\nis is through gamma motor neurons and so\nthese are sensory things so what's\nhappening is unlike when you tell your\nmuscle to contract it goes Alpha\nto the muscle contract these muscle\nspindles work such that it is oh I've\nbeen stretched sends signal back to some\nCentral Point typically in the spinal\ncord and we don't actually want to go\nall the way up the brain we've got a\ntime delay this is why these are\nsubconscious autonomic right versus\nsomatic so the gamma is going to go back\nto the central location and then come\nback through the Alpha motor neurons\nuntil it to contract so you have this\nwonderful mechanism of sensing stretch\ngoing back well one Theory that's been\nput forward regarding muscle damage is\nthat the pressure is actually being\napplied to those nerve endings of the\nmuscle spindles\nand that's actually responsible for the\npain signal that's going back\nand coming up to your brain and you're\nregistering that as pain rather than it\nis actually in the the contractile units\nso the muscle fibers that's a very\nintriguing idea uh because\nit would suggest that stretching muscles\nin order to alleviate soreness might be\nthe exact incorrect thing to do yeah now\nI'm not saying that's for sure for\ncertain I'm just building off the\nmechanistic logic that we've laid out\nhere yeah really that you've laid out\nhere there's the more effective\nprinciple based on exactly that which is\nthis is generally why low level movement\nis effective at reducing acute soreness\nbecause that's low-level contraction\nwith the muscles and you're going to\nanti-stretch and get tissue out and get\nfluid out\nwow you're literally pumping it out of\nthe the cell yes and in our previous\nepisode where we were talking about\nprogramming we're using the Wii but\nlet's be fair here where you were\neducating us including me\num in the audience about different\nstructures for programming exercise\nfor specific adaptations Etc of the\nmonth\nweek year scales Etc\nwe had a brief um discussion about the\nfact that if one trains legs very hard\nwith resistance training you know some\nheavy squatting or dead lifting it yeah\nor and there's some soreness that\noftentimes doing some quote-unquote\nlighter cardio or\num some uh low impact work the next day\nor or any number of different things\nthat involve\num not high intensity\ncontractions of the muscles but that do\nrequire contractions of the muscles that\nit can alleviate soreness more quickly\nthan if one were to Simply lie around\nand you know watch Netflix or something\nyeah that's exactly right the um\nto go back just a little bit as well the\nif that's really the case\num the question is like where is this\ninflammatory signal coming from and\nwhile there's much to be learned there\nthere is a little bit of\ninformation right now that suggests it's\npotentially coming from free radicals\nreleased from the mitochondria again\nthat may or may not hold up as more\nresearch comes I'm not sure but if you\nremember back to our uh conversation on\nendurance so we talked about the\nelectron transport chain and aerobic\nmetabolism and regardless of whether or\nnot you're getting energy from\nglycolysis\nor carbohydrates remember they have to\nbe finished\nthrough aerobic metabolism so even if\nyou're lifting weights\nand you're using carbs for your fuel you\nhave got to finish that metabolism by\nrunning it into the mitochondria and\nPerforming oxidative metabolism as a\nresult of that that electron transport\nchain runs so theoretically if free\nradicals which is which are\nhyper-reactive oxygen species basically\nthey're oxygen molecules that are\nmissing in electrons so that they react\nto a lot of things they're the opposite\nof antioxidants by the way this is\nthe oxygen molecules with extra protons\nso they can balance the charge if those\nleak out that in and of itself is going\nto be a massive inflammatory signal and\nthat's probably what signals the cause\nof these neutrophils and macrophages and\nkicks off this entire Cascade again I\nbelieve we need more research there I\nneed to look into it maybe it's more\ndefinitive than I that I know but that's\nprobably what's happening potentially\nwhat's happening rather\ncauses that Cascade in Signal also\nwhat you have is this combination of\nwell if that's the case why am I not\ngetting tremendous amount of muscle\ndamage when I do more aerobic based\nexercise\nwell because you don't have the\nmechanical tension pulling on the fibers\nthat's actually causing damage to the\ncell wall that allows these free\nradicals to escape the mitochondria and\nthe cell wall so that's the best we can\npostulate at this moment as to why those\nthings are happening and then why again\nlow level exercise tends to enhance even\nthings like percussion so using either\ninstruments that put a low level of\nvibration into your leg or like\npneumatic boots so you can massage all\nthese things are generally probably\nhelping because they're moving that\nstuff out\na demon most specifically so pressure\ncomes off of those nerve endings and the\nmuscle spindles\nand allows you to stop receiving that\nsignal of pain despite the fact that you\ndidn't actually regenerate tissue at all\nyet\nfascinating and I think\nthat beautifully frames where we're\nheaded next which is to talk about all\nthe different modes of recovery and how\nto accelerate them and perhaps even how\nto combine different forms of recovery\nin order to become better at recovering\nand in doing so make faster progress\nwith Fitness before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is also separate from Dr\nAndy galpin's teaching and research\nroles at Cal State Fullerton it is\nhowever part of our desire and effort to\nbring zero cost to Consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public in keeping with\nthat theme we'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast our first\nsponsor is momentous momentous makes\nsupplements of the absolute highest\nquality the huberman Lab podcast is\nproud to be partnering with momentous\nfor several important reasons first of\nall as I mentioned their supplements are\nof extremely high quality second of all\ntheir supplements are generally in\nsingle ingredient formulations if you're\ngoing to develop a supplementation\nprotocol you're going to want to focus\nmainly on using single ingredient\nformulations with single ingredient\nformulations you can devise the most\nlogical and effective and cost-effective\nsupplementation regimen for your goals\nin addition momentous supplement ship\ninternationally and this is of course\nimportant because we realize that many\nof the huberman lab podcast listeners\nreside outside the United States if\nyou'd like to try the various\nsupplements mentioned on the huberman\nLab podcast in particular supplements\nfor Hormone Health for Sleep\noptimization for Focus as well as a\nnumber of other things including\nexercise

ratios of the electrolyte\nsodium magnesium and potassium to\noptimize cellular functioning for mental\nand physical performance most people\nrealize that hydration is key we need to\ningest enough fluids in order to feel\nour best and perform our best but what\nmost people do not realize is that the\nproper functioning of our cells and\nnerve cells neurons in particular\nrequires that sodium magnesium and\npotassium be present in the correct\nratios now of course people with\npre-hypertension and hypertension need\nto be careful about their sodium intake\nbut what a lot of people don't realize\nis that if you drink caffeine if you\nexercise and in particular if you're\nfollowing a very clean diet that is not\na lot of processed foods which of course\nis a good thing chances are you're not\ngetting enough sodium potassium and\nmagnesium to optimize mental and\nphysical performance element contains a\nscience-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams\nthat's one gram of sodium 200

and\nsleep tracking capacity I've been using\nan eight-sleep mattress cover for about\nthe last eight months and it has\ncompletely transformed my sleep I'm\nsleeping about the same amount but I'm\nsleeping far deeper and I'm now getting\nthe proper ratios of so-called rapid eye\nmovement or REM sleep and slow wave\nsleep and waking up feeling far more\nrecovered mentally and physically the\nunderlying mechanism for all that is\nvery straightforward I've talked many\ntimes before on this podcast and\nelsewhere about the critical\nrelationship between sleep and body\ntemperature that is in order to fall\nasleep at night your body needs to drop\nby about one to three degrees in terms\nof core body temperature and waking up\ninvolves a one to three degree increase\nin core body temperature with eight\nSleep mattress covers you can adjust the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nto be one temperature at the start of\nthe night a different temperature the\nmiddle of the night and a different\ntemperature as you approach morning Each\nof which can place you into the optimal\nstages of sleep and have you waking up\nfeeling more refreshed than ever if\nyou'd like to try

to\nexercise actually occur\nI'd love for you to share with us what\nhappens or needs to happen during\nrecovery in order for us to get better\nat anything endurance strength Etc\nbut also how specific types of exercise\nstimuli and specific types of\nadaptations that we trigger so running a\nbit further lifting a bit more weight\nslowing the Cadence of a given movement\nEtc how those specific types of triggers\nfor adaptation relate to the specific or\nmaybe similar types of recovery that are\nrequired for us to make progress in one\nof our previous episodes we were talking\nabout how the Harvard fatigue lab really\nidentified this idea of homeostasis or\nat least sort of championed it for it\nand that's important because\nand all levels physiology wants to\nreturn to homeostasis so what happens in\nterms of adaptation is you've challenged\nit to a level that it realizes if it\ndoes not make a change it will not be\nable to get back to the same level of\nhomeostasis that's fundamentally what's\nhappening that is recovery that process\nof taking an insult being temporarily\nreduced in functionality\ncausing a change so that now we come\nback and get what we often call in\nsupport performance super compensation\nall that really is doing though is\nbringing you to a new level of\nhomeostasis effectively\nit is understanding if that same insult\ncomes again\nI need to be able to make sure that that\ndoesn't cause the same level of\ndisruption and so we raise the bar\nwhether this is enhancing our ability to\ntake the same level of mechanical\ntension on the muscle and not result in\nmicro damage whether this is being able\nto take the same reduction in energy and\nnot have that compromise of sleep or\nanything it's really fundamentally\nchanging so we can have a new level of\nhomeostasis because it's presuming it's\npredicting that that same insult is\ngoing to come again down the road\nI wanted to clarify for people that when\nDr Galvin says insult\nwhile he may actually insult me\num insult is the nerd speak terminology\nfor some sort of damage inflicted to a\ntissue or system so\num he's speaking about the insult to the\nmuscle or insult to the neuromuscular\nconnection created by adding more weight\nto the bar running a further distance\num\nrunning a bit fast or or pedaling faster\nthat creates a micro insult or an insult\nand now because everyone is familiar\nwith um psychological and verbal insults\nyou'll never forget that biological\nconcept it's important we tag another\nthing here which is called hormesis it's\none of my favorite phenomenon and it\neffectively means this that there is a\ndosage or toxicity\nresponds to almost everything and if you\nthink about this in the context of say\ndrugs what this means is if I gave you\n10 milligrams of something\nthat it would be okay but if I give you\n20 it'd be a problem and eventually if I\ngo up and give you enough this thing\nturns toxic this is the case of\neverything from cyanide where it can\nactually be in small dosages in nature\nin fact it's in many of the fruits that\nyou eat but it's not a dosage that it\ndoesn't matter if that dosage gets\nhigher though that actually can cause\nproblems and if it is high enough it can\nactually kill you instantaneously\nthe back end of that though is because\nyou introduce this micro insult as you\nframed it for me perfectly your body\nwill then adapt to it and that's really\nwhat's happening with exercise\nadaptation is it is a hormetic stressor\nand why that's important is\nif you look at the immediate responses\nto exercise you see an extremely large\nincrease in inflammation you see\noxidative stress you see a whole Cascade\nof autophagy like all these problems\nquote unquote happening it's what's\nactually quite funny here is as a part\nof my PhD the academic portion I had to\ngo through the medical side of the\nschool and so I was my physiology class\nwas in med school so I'm the only\nnon-medical doctor in that class right\nI'm a PhD so I leave my lab I walk\nacross campus and I take physiology\nclass with these folks and I died the\nwhole time internally because every time\nwe would cover a new area\nit was basically the the exact same\nvalue or number\nin a medical setting is like oh my gosh\nthey're going to die\nand in performance setting is like this\nperson's in fantastic shape\nis I I I've never it still amuses me to\nthis day obviously because it's just\nsimple things like total blood volume\nright and you cover like okay if you\nhave a patient come in and their blood\nvolume is six liters you know I can\nimmediately get them on a diuretic of\nsome sort because they're going to have\na heart attack as blood pressure gets up\nright now I'm immediately thinking damn\nsix leaders that that person is super\nfit because that is actually a positive\nadaptation to training it's one of the\nmost important if not the most important\nadaptation to endurance training is\nenhance total blood volume so you'll\nstore more blood in your body when\nyou're more fit than you are less fit so\nI mean I could go on all these things\nsodium concentrations potassium\nconcentrations are like you look at\nthese things on paper and you don't know\nif that person is about to die because\nthey're 65 years old and out of shape or\nif that person is going to break a world\nrecord the marathon this brings up a\nvery important tangent which is uh for\ninstance if you go and take a blood test\nand you are somebody who exercises very\nintensely uh with resistance training\nyou're blood creatinine levels can be\nway out of range and if your physician\ndoesn't know that you're doing certain\nforms of exercise might say wow there's\na lot of muscle tissue damage occurring\nin your body yeah as you mentioned\nbefore your total blood volume is is\ndangerously High when in fact you are\nfar healthier and and need much fitter\nthan the person who as numbers would be\nin range that said obviously there are\num limits to these to these statements\nwhereby you would want to be cautious\nand take action to ameliorate a very\nelevated blood creatinine level or\nsomething of that sort but the point\nyou're you're bringing up is is also one\nabout the field of medicine which is\nthat\nmany not all but many Physicians don't\ntake into consideration uh the outside\nactivities that people are doing and so\nit becomes a kind of a plug-and-play\ntype um type way of looking at blood\ncharts yeah we've done many thousand\nathletes blood chemistry and uh we we\ndon't use\nfirst of all we never look at disease\nstuff that's not what we do we take\npeople that are healthy and try to\noptimize performance and blood chemistry\nis one of the best tools if you really\nunderstand what you're doing there you\ncan get some incredibly powerful\ninformation out of blood chemistry that\nactually relates to what we're going to\ntalk to today in terms of measuring\neverything from acute to Chronic\ndehydration to sleep deprivation can be\nidentified in in blood chemistry to\noptimization improvements in nutrition\nsupplementation there's a lot you can\nget there if people are interested in\nthat field I would Point them to a\ngentleman named Dan Garner it was just\nan absolute Juggernaut and wizard in\nblood chemistry for high performance but\nwell you can get a ton of information\nfrom that if you understand the\ndifference between exactly what you\ntalked about looking for signals of\nincreased risk of cardiovascular events\n25 years down the road versus is this\nthe optimal value for high performance\nin an athlete which is what our our\ndatabase and all of our software and\nstuff does is only looking for those\nthings so I'm going to talk about some\nof the biomarkers to look for a little\nbit later salivary so some blood stuff\nbut we'll maybe save that part of the\nconversation for down the road tell me\nabout different time scales of recovery\nsure this is actually where I was trying\nto answer your question for and then I\ngot myself way off track but the reason\nI brought up the Hermetic thing is if\nyou understand that some things in the\nacute say 24 to 40 hour period\nlook terrible\nit's actually fine right so this is the\nstimuli that's causing adaptation so the\nreason I brought up the medical\nexchange there is because you if you\nlooked at inflammatory markers and then\nyou mentioned some of them you would see\nthat they are highest acute within\nseconds to minutes to hours after\nexercise however that's exactly the\nstimuli needed to bring them down\nchronically\nokay and so chronically meaning maybe in\nthat moment they are elevated and then\nmaybe they're coming down 24 hours later\nin 48 hours however if you were to\ncompare your resting level say that\nMonday before you worked out\nto your resting level that Monday the\nweek following the week following that\nwhat you would probably see is your\nBaseline inflammation goes down\nand so we got to be really careful are\nwe talking immediately post-exercise man\nthese markers look terrible maybe my\nrecovery score is awful\nEtc that's not necessarily a bad thing\nbecause what we're like looking to do is\nto not only change what's happening\ntoday but we're trying to cause\nadaptation that may take us weeks or\nmonths to actually\naccess\nI love that you're highlighting this\nprinciple because one of the more\nobvious ones to me now that you've said\nthis is heart rate absolutely my heart\nrate goes very very high during exercise\nand I do that fairly consistently or\neven semi-consistently my resting heart\nrate will actually be quite a bit lower\nthat's a fantastic example really what\nyou're getting at here is this concept\nwhere I think it's important to\ndifferentiate between adaptation and\noptimization\nnow we hear that word and I use it and\nmost scientists hate it but it's a good\ncommunication tool optimization\nif you're optimizing for the current\nmoment\nyou're almost surely compromising the\nlate adaptation\nright if if I were to say do the thing\nright now that makes you feel the\nabsolute best in the world and you're\nlike great you took a nap and you had a\ndonut like awesome you feel amazing but\nyou know it's causing long-term issues\nthe same can be said on the back end if\nyou're never choosing things that make\nyou better right now\nyou're never actually going to see an\nadaptation so what we're really doing\nwith this recovery conversation is\nplaying this game of balancing immediate\ngratification with the leg gratification\nand how do we identify how much to do\nnow versus not how do I use a value or a\nmarker whether this is how tired I feel\ntoday how sore I am today versus a score\non an app or a tracking metric but this\nis a blood marker anything and\nunderstand if that's what I need to\ncause the adaptation I want a week a\nmonth three months from now in the case\nof\nsome of our other athletes it's even up\nto four years right we're trying to\ncause adaptations that will get us where\nwe want to get in the Olympics or World\nChampionships or World Cup or wherever\nwe're going to be so that's the\nframework we have to think about\nrecovery we we maybe falsely think about\nit as I need to maximize my recovery\ntoday\nand you could do something like\ntaken anti-inflammatory whether this is\na supplementation or a drug or maybe\nthis is ice\noh cool that's great that will enhance\nyour recovery in this moment that'll\nmake you feel better today probably\ntomorrow but what we know is that blocks\nthe signal for adaptation so you're not\ngoing to get the same results you know\nfour six eight weeks from now so when we\ntalk about recovery we have to\nunderstand what tool am I using and why\nand in order to do that we have to\nunderstand what am I training for\nand what am I trying to maximize if I am\nin the middle of a season with an\nathlete and we are competing tomorrow I\nam going to head towards acute recovery\nright because I have to actuate that\nperformance right now if I am starting\nthe off season\nI'm not hedging towards recovery I'm\nactually hedging towards adaptation so\nwe're not going to deploy any of these\nespecially things like\nthere's evidence that a combination of\nvitamin C and vitamin E\nwill blunt hypertrophic adaptations\nbecause they're anti-inflammatory with\nantioxidants right other other Studies\nhave shown maybe they don't have\nuh an inhibitory fact they may or may\nnot\npoint is conceptually\nyou want to be careful of what you're\ntrying to optimize for and you have to\nhave that forethought and that alone is\ngoing to dictate your decision making\nwith whether or not again you get in the\neyes uh you do that now we will cover\nsome tools like massage\nthat are pretty fine to use you don't\nhave to worry about those blocking\nlong-term adaptation but others you're\ngoing to want to be very careful about\nso this principle that you've laid out\nfor us\nwhich is that there's a set of events\nthat occur during exercise that trigger\nthe adaptation\nand that sets in motion a number of\nadaptations that occur during recovery\nthat then\ngive us the exact opposite response to\nwhat the trigger was so I'll go back to\nthe heart rate example\num heart rate is close to maximal or\nmaximal you do that enough times within\na short you know a week or so or two\nweeks and you're\nresting heart rate goes down\nas I recall a few episodes ago you said\nthat your maximum heart rate doesn't\nreally change that much is that correct\nyes okay but your resting heart rate can\ngo down quite a bit yep\nis that a general theme meaning\ndo we have a more or less set upper\nlimit or ceiling for things like\ninflammatory markers for heart rate\nmaybe even things like stress and what\nwe do when we deliberately trigger\nstress or a\ndramatic increase in heart rate or\ndramatic increase in inflammatory\nmarkers is that we are lowering the\nfloor but that the ceiling Remains the\nSame\nit's very dependent upon the marker so\nin the case of maximum heart rate it\nwill not change\nwith the exception of one thing which is\nage\nbrings it down training will not change\nit up in most circumstances if you look\nat something like an inflammatory\nresponse I suppose theoretically there\nis a ceiling though I'm not aware of it\num I can tell you right now looking at\nblood markers the things like creatine\nkinase so remember the conversation\nabout\nmetabolism and with that we use the\nphosphocreatine as one of our primary\nfuel sources for explosive exercise well\nif we're using phosphocreatine this\ncreatine kinase remember kinase are\nenzymes that that function to break\nthings down for the most part so\ncreatine kinase is the enzyme you use to\nbreak down creatine when you do that a\nlot then that creatine kinase gets out\nof muscle\nand seeps into the blood myoglobin is\nactually another fantastic marker by the\nway myoglobin is if you think about\nhemoglobin being in blood is the\nmolecule that carries oxygen around when\nit's in the muscle tissue then it's\nmyoglobin mild meaning muscle and it's\nthe same globulin thing so there's a\nbunch of markers you can look at muscle\nbreakdown and one of the things that you\ncan see is a creatine kinase level\nthat's elevated after say\num one bout of exercise and and you\nmight it might be up\nyou know five or six-fold I've actually\nseen this number in offensive lineman in\nthe NFL be something like 500 plus fold\nso even within just one category to the\nnext that number can get extraordinarily\nhigh and if you know this is actually\none in an important Point here\nif you're paying attention to any\nmechanistic research or you use you're\nusing that to inform your decision\nmaking you have to be extraordinarily\ncareful of magnitude\nand what I mean by that is\nif I were to be running a western blot\nlooking at a signaling protein\num and a muscle uh did this activation\nof this protein turn on mitochondrial\nbiogenesis and I saw that whatever\nintervention we gave it whether it was a\nnutrition thing or a drug or an exercise\nand I saw that that signaling protein\nincreased by 20 percent\nI would basically assume that to be\ntotally physiologically irrelevant\nbecause in order for that to be\nimportant it totally depends on the\nmarket you're looking at but\nyou some markers I might need to see\nfour or five six hundred fold increase\nbefore I know that that will actually be\nenough to be what we call\nphysiologically relevant others if\nthey're up one or two percent that is\nrelevant and so you really want to be\ncareful when you're either reading\npapers or looking at Social Media stuff\nif people are just talking about this\nmarker increase this much it may not\nmatter it may be totally irrelevant\nphysiologically and so you have to that\ndoes also if you're wondering like how\nthe hell are the all these people well\nthat's how they can trick you a little\nbit and intentionally or not it could be\njust they're trying their best but they\ndon't really understand that area enough\nand so that's an important point to pay\nattention to so to answer your question\nagain fully\nit would be hard to determine if there\nwas truly a maximum level\num some things don't want to move\nlike blood pH\nit doesn't really want to move the range\nthat you're going to move from is you\nknow like 6.8 to 7.4 and if you get up\nto like 7.9 like you're probably in big\nbig big trouble other things again can\ngo up 500 5 000 fold and so the markers\nwill really determine that answer\nwell at some point in the future I'd\nlove to continue this discussion around\nthe topic of stress specifically yeah um\nand maybe we will get into that a little\nbit later today when we um get into the\nuse of deliberate cold exposure\nbecause that's certainly\num has effects related directly to\ntemperature on tissue but it certainly\nhas mental effects in terms of raising\none's level of perceived pain it's fun\num where some people love it and some\npeople love it for the feeling they get\nduring it\num deliberate cold exposure some people\nonly like it for the feeling that they\nget after it not unlike exercise totally\nI love to train I love exercise but I\nknow many people who uh um they loathe\nexercise but they love the feeling\nafterward so this will be a theme that\nwe will come back to\nthank you for indulging my interest in\nthat semi-tangent I think it's a\nrelevant tangent if there is such a\nthing if you can now return us to the\ndifferent time scales yeah and modes of\nrecovery because I think where we are\nheaded is how to get better at recovery\nyep let's talk about the tools let's\ntalk about what to measure and identify\nfor all four of these distinct levels so\nlevel one is what we call overload and\njust very quickly what that means is I\ndid a workout today\nthe sign and symptom of overload is your\nfatigued acute performance is down so I\nworked out hard right now\nif I were to go try to do a maximum\neffort I would be reduced in my ability\nthe recovery period for acute overload\nis minutes to days\nright that's generally what we call\nacute overload and that's what we're\nlooking for right so we systems should\ntheoretically see that hormetic stressor\ncome back in response come back bigger\nbetter more efficient Etc\nif you were to continue training in that\nstate like most of us do and say I did a\nworkout today I had a little bit of\nacute overload gonna work out again\ntomorrow a little more acute overload\ncan work out the next day a little more\nacute overload even if you took a day in\nbetween it's that doesn't matter right\nyou just continue these acute bouts of\ninsult\nthen you're going to be pushing into the\nabsolute golden Target\nwhich is what we call functional\noverreaching\nso you have over reached\nwhat you can currently do and it results\nin a functional outcome and what we mean\nfunctionally here is performance is\nenhanced\nand again performance being whatever you\ndeem it to be you're stronger\nyou've enhanced muscle size your\nmitochondria has improved you've\nwhatever the thing is it's not just a\nphysical performance thing right\namazing\nrecovery time for functional\noverreaching is typically a few days to\nmaybe even a week or so\nand so typically what we see happen is\nprior to a competition individuals will\ndo what we call a taper which is a\nreduced training volume\nfor some short period of time and there\nwas the reason they do that is to again\nactualize is the phrase We year is here\nthe adaptations and so you worked hard\nfor six weeks and you know theoretically\nthe workouts you did three four five six\nweeks ago once you allow the system to\nrecover\nwill be actualized which means your\nperformance will be enhanced here so\nfunctional overreaching is the golden\nTarget okay if you were to be at the\npoint of functional overreaching and you\ncontinue to train so it intensified\nwhether this was through intensity this\nthrough volume or really as we said\nearlier you had something holding back\nyour recovery it doesn't really matter\nright it's it's sort of two sides of the\nsame coin\nthen you would move into what we call\nnon-functional overreaching so you've\nover reached again but now it is\nnon-functional as in you did not see a\npositive benefit once recovery allowed\nthis typically means you have weeks it\ntakes weeks to come back from and you\nbasically just get back to Baseline and\nthis is where a lot of folks are who end\nup in this vicious cycle and so you're\nlike man I'm not getting the results I\nwant I'm going to train harder I'm not\ngetting results I want I'm going to\ntrain harder and harder but because\nyou've caught recovery isn't improved\nyou just end up in the same spot so then\nyou train more and you end up the same\nspot and you end up then just either\nblowing up or quitting and you're not\ngetting where you want\nif you were to continue past that point\nyou may actually be in what we actually\ncall over training and that typically is\na considered to be over trained if it\ntakes months to recover from so most\npeople think they're over trained are\nreally not you're just probably\nnon-functionally overreached\nand again classic distinction is if you\ntook three or four days off and you felt\nbetter you weren't probably quote\nunquote over trained you were probably\njust in this area of non-functional\nreaching you need a little bit of a back\noff if you and this has been the case\nI've had this happen with gymnasts and a\ncheerleader and some other things where\nthey take a month off and we're barely\nseeing them start to come back to their\nBaseline numbers in any number of areas\nmood desire to train testosterone\ncortisol ratios biomarkers in a number\nof areas physical performance vertical\njump height like all these things they\njust start to get back to Baseline so\nover true over training is actually\nquite rare non-functional overreaching\nis much more common\nand it is a shorter time frame scale so\nwhen we talk about recovery those are\nthe four pieces that we're really\nthinking about and so if you are\nconcerned about oh I'm super sore how do\nI get less sore how do I either not be a\nsore\nnext time I do that same workout or I'm\nsuper sorry now how do I recover those\nare playing in that first category of\noverload and we can certainly talk about\nhow to figure that out but the quick\nanswer is\nyou got to go back to our previous\nepisodes and just pay attention to the\nvolume intensity recommendations\nif you're getting significantly uh more\ndamage or fatigue in a workout you\nprobably have increased your volume too\nquickly\nor something else is dragging your\nstress bucket down but generally this is\na problem of training\num you either didn't warm up\nsufficiently you're fueling strategy is\noff which we'll talk about in The Next\nEpisode or you've violated one of our\nprinciples of increasing intensity and\nvolume sort of too quickly\nif it's past that and you're getting to\na stage where you're just like I'm\nfeeling beat up all the time my energy\nis going down I'm just not feeling like\nI'm recovered now we're in this\noverreaching stage so the the story I\nkind of tell here always is a few years\nago I was working\nand my wife Natasha was in the garage\ntraining and I'm doing something and\nlike she comes stumbling\nand she has this look on her eyes and\nthey're like her eyeballs are giant\nshe's just like wobbling and she's like\nI effed up I was like what do you mean\nyou like effed up and she's just like\nI read the program wrong and she's like\nTrump like what'd you do like she was\nsupposed to be doing 10 sets of three\nevery minute on the minute and she did\nthree sets of ten every minute on the\nminute\nand she was absolutely wrecked she\ncouldn't move for a few hours afterwards\nand then for days she's just like you\nhave to handle the kids like I can't get\nout of bed I can't move so that was like\na classic example of all right like we\ndon't need to fix recovery here you're\njust a dummy and you did the dream way\ntoo hard too long like this is not we\ndon't have a problem here so if it's a\nsituation like that it's generally you\njust the program was way off if it's\nconstantly happening where you're just\nlike man like for whatever reason every\nonce in a while I'm getting really sore\nor having a really bad performance in\nthese workouts then we need to go to our\nother stress bucket take a look at our\nallostatic load or allostasis and get\nfigured out what's happening there um so\nthose are the the easy ways to flag\nacute overload problems\nI'd like to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor athletic greens\nathletic greens is a vitamin mineral\nprobiotic and adaptogen drink designed\nto help you meet all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs I've been\ntaking athletes at greens daily since\n2012. so I'm delighted that they're a\nsponsor of this podcast the reason I\nstarted taking athletic greens and the\nreason I still take athletic greens once\nor twice a day is that it helps me meet\nall of my foundational nutritional needs\nthat is it covers my vitamins my\nminerals and the probiotics are\nespecially important to me athletic\ngreens also contains adaptogens which\nare critical for recovering from stress\nfrom exercise from work or just

of\nvitamin D3 K2 again if you'd like to try\nathletic greens go to athleticgreens.com\nhuberman to claim the special offer I'm\nhappy that you pointed out the\ndistinction between functional\noverreaching over training and being\nover trained I think one one common\nmistake that people make in thinking\nabout biology generally is that they\nthink in terms of nouns and adjectives\nand not verbs amazing I love that so\nmuch you know biology is a collection of\nprocesses or processes depending on who\nyou are and where you live and who you\ntrained with\nbeing over trained\nis a state that in many ways is an\nadjective you're over trained I'm over\ntrained\nit's like saying uh you know I'm an\nAmerican I'm a you know Czechoslovakian\nwhatever it happens to be right and in\nmany ways people do start to associate\nwith an identity at least a transient\nidentity and they start making all sorts\nof decisions it sounds like about what\nsorts of verbs they will and will not\nengage in whereas I think if we look at\nthings as processes and we\nassign verbs to them then we can say\nokay I'm\nfunctionally overreaching\nor I'm truly over training which is a\nmatter of degrees correct right or under\ntraining for that matter I'm not I'm\nreaching but I'm not\nfunctionally reaching it's just it's\njust performance and you know just as\nwith the nervous system won't change\nunless you give it a reason to this is\nthe reason why if you can perform\nsomething perfectly or speak a language\nperfectly there's there's no rewiring of\nthe nervous system this myth that we've\nall been told that every experience\nrewires your nervous system it's\ndifferent now than it was two seconds\nago that's that's a ridiculous illogical\nstatement we know that's not true if\nyour nervous system can perform\nsomething it has no reason to change and\nit won't muscles the same way this is\nwhy you have to progressively overload\nyou have to learn something new or\nchallenge your muscle to do something\nnew it's same thing so in the example\nthat you gave uh with your wife doing\nthis workout that turned out to be far\nmore strenuous she had functionally\noverreach in some sense she might have\nbeen over training or heading in the\ndirection of over training but the\nmistake would be to assume that\nshe was over trained right as I kind of\nit's almost becomes a bit of a state or\na character assignment\num as opposed to a verb and in any case\nthere's no perfect way to describe this\nwe're talking about nouns and adjectives\nand and we're also um talking about\nverbs but I think the verbs are really\nanchored down in processes and things\nthat we do actions that we can take and\nso um if I may I'd like to just\nhighlight this this idea of\nshifting one sinking towards verb\nactions\nrather than labels on the state that we\nhappen to be in or the person that we\nhappen to be right sometimes it even\ndoes become kind of character logical in\nthe way that people describe it and uh\nso I have to believe that there is\nsomething called over training that over\ntraining is real in other words but that\nwe don't ever really know if we're over\ntrained\nyou nailed it there's there's no you\nknow it's not like a red flag uh you\nknow shoots up out of your shoulder and\nsay I'm over trained you know it's\num so in doing so I hope that we can\nstart thinking about some of the verbs\nthe actions that we can all take in\norder to ensure that we stimulate\nProgressive overload one way or another\nand at the same time that we don't fall\ninto these bins of character assignment\nwhere suddenly we decide that we need to\ndo X like take a month off or something\nlike that because I I'm beginning to\nrealize\num from our discussion that that's\nexactly the wrong way to go those are\nfantastic points I want to make sure it\nis clear\nthat there is no clinical diagnosis for\nover training there are no standards\nthere's no test or a blood panel you can\npull that would actually identify you in\nthat state so your your distinction Here\nAndrew of these are verbs and rather\nthan nouns is is so wonderful because\nthat is exactly the case the only way we\ncould really come retroactively diagnose\none with over training is if again we\nhad you did weeks\nof recovery and you only got back to\nBaseline so we can't do it in the moment\nI can't take a single test\nthere's no subjective marker or anything\nthat says you are over trained it is\nsimply you are probably over training\nand we need to reverse that quickly or\nin the case of the step before you are\nprobably non-functionally overreaching\nand if you continue to do this you will\nprobably enter a new stage where this is\nyou're over training and we need to come\nback so that's an important thing to let\npeople know is there's no one thing we\ncould actually point to that says you\nare here you are not a noun this is a\nverb so what are some tools that we can\nuse to enhance our recovery yep let's\nstart off with that acute overload phase\nso in other words I just did a workout\nand I'm feeling awful or I just did one\ntwo days ago and I'm super sore how do I\nget rid of that right now well there's a\ncouple of things you can do immediately\nafter your workout and then others that\nare maybe more actionable a day later or\ntwo days later and we'll just cover\nhandful of them we'll do some nutrition\nand hydration and supplementation in the\nnext episode I'm going to cover\neverything else not in that category\nright now so a couple of things number\none\nyou can actually start Kickstart that\nrecovery process at the end of your\ncurrent training session and I guess I\nshould say it this way\nI strongly suggest you start this\nrecovery process immediately after the\nworkout you mentioned earlier about this\nidea of\nyou got to get a really high peak of\nstress to cause adaptation but I\nactually didn't explain that correctly\nbecause what has to happen is you need\nthat extremely high peak but you then\nyou have to be met with an extremely\nsharp recovery back down and so you know\nyou've talked about this before in some\nof your neuroplasticity stuff and in\nterms of what has to happen that caused\nthe insult and then you immediately need\nto be able to recover to make sure that\nthat causes changes in the brains same\nthing happens here so we need a really\nsharp and high inflammatory response and\nthen if you do not meet it with an\nimmediate recovery period\nthe signal won't be there to maximize\nyour results so what's that mean you can\nactually do a couple of things number\none is actually listening to slow paced\nmusic\nthere's evidence to suggest fast-paced\nmusic may slow down your recovery and\nslow pace when actually enhance it so if\nyou just change from you know your\nmaximum get you up and get going music\nduring the workout to a slower lower\nCadence that will help you kick start\nthe idea of a similar note you can also\nuse what we call down regulation\nbreathing you could do them in\nconjunction or one or the other\nwhichever is up to you so my personal\nfavorite method here is somewhere\nbetween three to ten minutes of\nfinishing your training session laying\ndown I'd like to be in that position you\ncould certainly do it in the Lotus\nposition but I think laying on your back\nis generally more effective personal\npreference there no science I like the\nitems being covered getting into this\ndark quiet sort of area\nand then just breathing through your\nnose in a structured Cadence there's a\nlot of different things you can try an\neasy example is just box breathing so\nand you can imagine box having four\nsquares so what you're going to do is\ninhale for somewhere between like three\nto eight seconds and whatever number you\nchoose you keep that same tempo and so\nlet's say you chose to do a five second\ninhale\nthat's going to take you up vertically\nand then horizontally for your box is a\nfive second hold\nand then a five second exhale\nand then a five second hold and you just\nneed to repeat that for the time domain\nnow I typically honestly don't use a\ntimer\nyou'll actually notice a lot of people\nwill like fall asleep or get really\nclose to falling asleep in this period\nyou can do a triangle version of that\nwhere you do an inhale\nhold exhale and then go right back into\nyour inhale or up there's a bunch of\ndifferent tricks you can try here you\nneed to play around and see what\nactually works best for you\num 10 minutes is probably better but if\nyou can just at least give me three\nthat'll work if you're really really\nresistant you can actually do that just\nin the shower and so if you're gonna\nfinish your workout get in the shower\nagain just close your eyes in the shower\ngive me three minutes of focused\nrelaxation breathing and that will\naccelerate the recovery process I love\nit and I particularly love it because my\nlaboratory works on stress and\nrespiration okay breathing and the\ninteractions between the two\nand I'll just mention a result that was\njust accepted for publication so should\nbe out by time this day so there's uh\nthank you uh this is the beautiful work\nof uh not me directly although it took\nplace in my lab but as we know it's the\nstudents at both doctors of\num Dr Melise uh balbon uh in my lab it's\na phenomenal researcher\nthat showed that a short period of five\nminutes of box breathing of exactly the\ntype that you described\nor cyclic sign so two inhales followed\nby an extended exhale to lungs empty\nideally the inhales are done through the\nnose the exhales are done uh through the\nmouth although it could all be done\nthrough the nose\num or the mouth for that matter but\nprobably nose nose for inhale inhale\nmouth for exhale or\num uh in inhales through the nose and\nand exhale through the nose cyclic\nsighing as we refer to it done for five\nminutes both of those produce very\nsignificant decreases in resting heart\nrate\nthe over time will increase things like\nheart rate variability and so on and so\nforth\num so provided that there are extended\nexhales it seems like the calming\nresponse and the reduction in overall\nstress occurs the only thing that really\nsends things in the other direction\nwould be something like cyclic\nhyperventilation I'm sure you've\nobserved that\num and interestingly uh when we had\npeople just do five minutes of\nmeditation which during which of course\nthey are breathing but they're just\nallowing their breathing to progress\nhowever it happens to be in that moment\num or moments across the five minutes uh\nthere were reductions in the same sorts\nof markers of stress that I described\nbut not as significant as breathing so I\nlove the Brock's breathing tool post\nworkout\num and there's some other Alternatives\nthere too that I just mentioned but I\nthink people greatly underestimate the\npotency of breathing for shifting one's\nnervous system function away from stress\nor if one wants toward more alertness\nand stress I actually have a couple\nquestions for you on that sure I think\nthe audience would appreciate this uh\nhow long were those boxes was it just\nuser selected great question so we use\nthe carbon dioxide tolerance test\namazing in order for people to determine\nhow long the different sides of the Box\nshould be and you cover carbon dioxide\ntolerance tests in a previous episode we\ncan provide a link to that clip um in\nthe show note captions but as you point\nout it involves a long extended exhale\nto lungs empty\num and of course people could sit with\nlungs empty but they have to accurately\nFaithfully as we say report how long it\ntook them to empty their lungs we use\nthat as a as a gauge typically if it\ntakes if people go to lungs empty in 20\nseconds or less I believe I have to go\nback to the paper and look but I believe\nthat the duration for each of the sides\nof the boxes as it were was somewhere\nbetween\num two and three seconds if they had a\nCO2 discard time of anywhere from uh 20\nseconds up to about 40 45 seconds we use\nit the sides of the box where I believe\nbetween four and six seconds and then\nfor people longer than them who could\ndiscard their Arrow over a period of a\nminute or more we used a box duration\nthat is inhale hold exhale hold duration\nof somewhere between\nI believe it was\n[Music]\num\nseven or maybe it was eight and as long\nas 11 or 12 seconds yeah those will get\nyour kind of free diver types who can\nreally do this who are really well\ntrained for this sort of thing the don't\nquote me exactly on those numbers but\nthat that was approximate those line up\nexactly with what what we've done so I\nbelieve it's it's going to be close\nwithin seconds of non-important\nDistinction is it's going to be close\nenough so that's great and that was uh\nit took them what six weeks so this\nstudy was done over the period of a\nmonth and then when they were swapped\ninto a new pattern of breathing\num condition or meditation condition and\nthis was all done in the natural world\nas we say um they were wearing whoop\nbands they were getting heart rate heart\nrate variability sleep data subjective\ndata about mood Etc so there are a lot\nof measures but this was\num more than 100 subjects out in the\nwild of life\num and we tried as best we could to\ntrack life stress events and exercise\nand things like that that was harder to\ncontrol outside the laboratory really\nall those results speak to exactly\nexactly what you're describing here\nwhich is that deliberate respiration\nthat involves controlled holds and\nexhales really has a dramatic and very\nimmediate impact on reducing our levels\nof stress that's wonderful I'm not\nsurprised at all with your findings and\nwhat's really interesting about that is\nyou mentioned how the exhalation portion\nis primarily responsible for the down\nregulation and that's actually goes back\nto our previous endurance conversation\nwhich is that in general at rest at\nnon-altitude increases in CO2 are the\nprimary driver for ventilation and so\nwhat that generally means is inhales are\nassociated with an uptick and\nsympathetic State and exhales are\nassociated with a uptick of\nparasympathetic State this is generally\nwhy folks will do things like exhale and\nfinish that exhale right before they\nperform a very high\nPrecision neurological tasks so if\nyou're going to say aim at a Target and\nshoot you're going to Exhale fully and\nthen almost always execute that movement\nat the end of the exhale because that's\nwhen you're in your highest\nparasympathetic State and lowest drive\nfor ventilation I have to say I'm not\nsurprised at all that you guys found\nthat there's actually other data that\npoint to individuals particularly after\nendurance training that can get back\ndown to Baseline heart rate\nis going to be correlated with who gets\nthe most actual results of their\ntraining said that if you take a bunch\nof individuals and put them through an\nendurance training program and if you\nmeasure how quickly they can get back\ndown to Baseline after each workout in\ngeneral those folks that are better at\nthat are going to see greater\nimprovements in performance at the end\nof your say four or six or eight week\ntraining block and so there's a little\nbit of causation and correlation there\nthat we have to untie but I think it's\nenough to say hey\nif you invest these three and in your\ncase your your study was five minutes\nit's only going to enhance recovery\nyou have a likelihood\nof increasing the results from your\ntraining and now we also have additional\nbenefits like being able to transition\nmore appropriately into our next task\ngoing to work going to see family\nwhatever the thing is and it's it's a\nnice close\nto I asked you to be in a high\nsympathetic State body and I asked you\nto perform and to be under stress I gave\nyou recovery and now we're ready to\ntransition in our next thing so that we\ndon't take that exercise energy if you\nwill\ninto our next\ntask which may or may not want me in a\nsympathetic Drive state so if somebody\nis sore following a workout either\nlocally sore in a muscle group or group\nof muscles maybe in their legs or chest\nor torso or maybe their whole body is\nsore\nas it sometimes is the case\nwhat are some tools that they can\nImplement in order to accelerate the I\nwant to call it moving out of that\nsoreness but it's really as we know the\nalleviation of the soreness through a\nbunch of different processes what are\nthe most effective tools to push back on\nthat soreness and dissipate it yeah\nabsolutely\nfirst of all it's not lactate that's\njust a really important thing that we\nstill hear people talk about is you know\nyou're sore 24 hours later you got to do\nthis thing to get the lactate out of\nthere as we talked about in the\nmetabolism uh conversation and episode\nthat that is not the cause of fatigue\nand it's certainly not the cause of\nsoreness so not an actionable tip there\nbut just a pet peeve of mine when I hear\npeople say that that I get irritated so\nwe can maybe end that conversation\num strategies tools\nhere's what you can do you can actually\nwear compression gear that will help a\nlittle bit there's a decent amount of\nevidence suggesting if you just were to\nyou know put some tighter fitting\nclothes on Leisure wear or compression\ngear if you have it that can actually\nprevent a little bit of soreness from\noccurring so if you're in the case of\npoor Natasha and you realize you've just\ndone way way too much or you went and\nhung out with your bow hunting friend\nand you trained way too hard and you\nrealize oh my goodness I'm going to be\nvery sore here you can immediately put\non compression gear and weigh that\nreally for as long as possible what are\nsome examples of compression gear I've\nseen people on the plane with those high\nhigh socks\num I mean anything that you wear\ncompression gear for what you do for\nexercise so whether these are just you\nknow compression pants and leggings and\ntight fitting leggings uh whether this\nis a long sleeve shirt that's like a\nrash guard you would wear in you know\nJiu Jitsu or surfing or something like\nthat as long as it's tight fitting it\ndoesn't have to be much more than that\nyou can wear I suppose you could get the\nsocks it would be great but we generally\njust tell our leads them they've put on\na long sleeve compression shirts that\nthey would wear for their training and\nthen long compression leggings and\nthat'd be fine can people apply these\ncompression\num Garb after training and still get\nsome of the positive effects yeah I have\nnot seen any evidence to suggest that\nthat would block adaptation that may be\nthe case I I am not aware of those\nstudies if that happens but I certainly\nknow that the information suggests it\ncan hands a little bit of Muscle\nRecovery but ideally one knows if they\nare about to do a workout that could\ntrigger a lot of soreness yeah and then\nwhere's compression gear of some sort to\noffset that and if so\ndoes it have to be local to the muscle\ngroups that you're working on the reason\nI asked about the socks is my\nunderstanding the socks uh the the\ncompression socks people were on the\nplane is that it's going to shift the\npatterns of blood flow not just in the\nlower legs but all over the body yeah\nyou're probably going to want to focus\nit on the actual exercising tissue\nthough actually that's a really good\nquestion I don't know the answer of\nwhether or not you did an upper body\nworkout only or lower body compression\ngear if that would actually help that's\na great question it may have been done I\ndon't know but I don't know the answer\nto that in general we just\ntell people like where where the whole\nthing as much as you can um I actually\nam not concerned that you're wearing it\nduring your workout\nit is something you could put on\nafterwards or even wear just a little\nbit of compression the other day um\nwe've actually did a really fun study uh\nI collaborated with\num Bill Kramer who's uh you know Sports\nscientist of the Year award is the bill\nCramer award if that gives you an\nindication out of uh University of\nConnecticut as well as with Lee Brown so\ntwo Lifetime Achievement Award winners\nand we we put people on a plane in\nstores Connecticut and flew them to Cal\nState Fullerton so a cross-country\nflight and some of them got to wear\ncompression gear during the flight and\nothers did not and then they landed in\nCalifornia did a training bout put them\nback on the plane went back to stores\nand I think they did another training\nbout when they got back there\nthere was a lot of data that came out of\nthat paper but one of the things that\nwas clear is the compression group was\neffective\nat handling some of the blood related\ncoagulation and other issues associated\nwith long flights and particularly\nathletic performance so that's actually\na sneaky little Insider trick that I'll\nuse a lot with people particularly with\nathletes that are traveling is just wear\nthat compression gear on the plane so\nyou talked about that and that sort of\nrung that study to mind that as another\neffective strategy so compression gear\nin general as well as particularly on a\nplane basically the tighter you can get\nit the better without obviously making\nyour hands purple and being\nuncomfortable and things like that so it\ndoesn't have to be overly tight anything\nwill work and probably help so I'm also\ndoing that personally anytime I'm taking\na flight like that as much as I can just\nto feel a little better when I get there\nso what are some other methods that we\ncan use to alleviate acute soreness well\nif we continue down the same theme which\nis saying okay we'll use some sort of\npressure manipulation to enhance\nrecovery\nif compression is one strategy you can\nalso use things like compression boots\nor garments and these are nomadic\ndevices that will you know pump uh air\noutside you and compress back and forth\nthere's any number of devices that will\ndo this you can also use the physical\nhand so this would be massage and body\nwork they're all really working as best\nwe can tell on the same mechanisms which\nare effectively moving fluid in and out\nof the tissue as well as potentially\nenhancing blood flow increasing\ncapitalization and which is going to\nonly get nutrients in and waste products\nout so you can kind of pick and choose\nbased upon your budget preferences\navailability timing things like that so\nthose are all effective strategies\noutside of that really is the next\nlargest category\nwhich is now thermal and uh and so far\nin this discussion we've mentioned cold\nwater immersion and I talked about in\nthe hypertrophy section how you would\nnot want to do that immediately post\nexercise which would be getting into\ncold water or an ice bath if you're\ntrying to grow muscle mass having said\nthat there is good evidence showing that\ncold water immersion specifically is\neffective at reducing muscle soreness\nso it is a fair consideration and it's a\nclassic example of how there are no free\npasses in physiology nothing is always\ngood or always bad it's always about\nwhat are you willing to give up and\nversus what you're willing to get and\nthe case of like cold water immersion\nyou may be thinking yeah I might want\nsome of the hypertrophic adaptations but\nif you're in that phase of training\nwhere you're actually trying to push\nmore towards optimization in that moment\nrather than long-term adaptation then a\nan ice bath might be a great choice in\naddition if you fall into a scenario\nlike Natasha did and you realize like\nI'm just so unbelievably sore this might\ncost me three or four or five or six\ndays of training it might be worth it\nfor you to accelerate that recovery\nprocess by a couple of days so that you\ndon't miss so much training so it's just\na it's an algorithm it's an equation\nwhat am I looking for again if I'm in\nseason or trying to compete or if I have\njust done way way too much exercise and\nI am really in significant pain you\nwould probably be willing to give up\nsome small percentage of eventual muscle\ngrowth after a single session to get out\nof pain so of the cold strategies cold\nwater immersion is clearly the best\napproach rather than cold air or some\nother tactics so a cold shower is\nprobably not enough here you really do\nwant to be either in moderately cold\nthis is maybe 40 to 50 degree water for\nprobably north of 15 minutes or you can\nbe in sub 40 for as little as maybe five\nminutes to get some of the fact there\nand there's been a number of studies\num so I'm sort of summarizing a bunch of\nthat kind of into one rather than going\nthrough them Point by point\nthe numbers you just threw out uh which\nI'm assuming are um uh Fahrenheit\num seem seem really cold to me right\nuncomfortably cold absolutely so I\nalways recommend that people ease into\nit as a protocol overall that they not\nimmediately go to 35 degree uh cold\nwater if they've never done it before uh\nthat said once people are comfortable\nbeing uncomfortable because I always\nanswer the question how cold should it\nbe exactly would you agree that it\nshould be very very cold so much so that\nyou really really want to get out but\nthat you're able to stay in safely\nwhatever that value happens to be you\nabsolutely need to be safe having said\nthat we have actually in our xbt\nRetreats put dozens if not hundreds of\npeople at this point uh immediately in\nthe sub 35 degree water their first time\never and done you know three minutes\nmultiple rounds in a session so they can\nhandle it but you don't need to go that\ncrazy if you don't want you kind of have\nto play a game right do you want to be\nreally really cold for a short amount of\ntime or do you want to be like kind of\ncold for a longer amount of time I\nreally the only mistake you can make is\ndoing something like you know 65 degree\nwater\nwhich for most people is not very\ncomfortable and doing you know five or\nten minutes it's just not going to be\nit's probably not going to be effective\nso if you're like man 35 is is\nabsolutely crazy and you want to do 55\ndegree water and there's literature in\nthat area but it's going to say you need\nto probably be there somewhere almost\nreally north of 10 minutes and some of\nit will actually show you need to be in\nthere like well north of 20 to 30\nminutes so for my money I would rather\ngo really really cold and get it done in\nfive minutes but um personal preference\non this one you can also make it a\nlittle bit easier on yourself\nthere is not nearly as much evidence but\nthere is some on contrast stuff so uh\nthis is when you go cold hot and sort of\nback and forth there are no really good\nrules in terms of how much should you go\nhow many rounds how long and cold how\nlong and hot again there have been a\ncouple of studies but\nand obviously those studies use numbers\nbut that doesn't mean those have been\ntested to see what are optimal which is\na very big difference so you can really\njust kind of play that by feel\nhot is good for Recovery you just have\nto be careful because you are going to\nput more blood flow in the area and so\nyou may walk out of there with some\nadditional acute swelling which isn't\ngoing to put greater pressure on there\nso you have to kind of play with that I\npersonally\nreally like hot for Recovery I will feel\nmaybe not great in that moment but the\nnext day I tend to feel really really\ngood in addition if I wake up the next\nmorning and I'm really really hurting\nand I'm super stiff a hot bath will help\nthat\num quite a bit so you can play with some\nof those protocols again you don't have\nto do nice there's absolutely no\nrequirement to do so it is just an\noption if you're interested the studies\nof Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah are not\ndirectly aimed at alleviating soreness\nor recovery they're more about\nincreasing thermal capacity by a storage\nof uh Brown adipose tissue not the\nblubbery fat but the stuff around the\nclavicles and around the heart that help\nyou generate body heat at rest and\nmetabolism and so on and the numbers\nthere that\num she's come up with again have not\nbeen tested against all the possible\nderivations just like with breathing we\ndid five minute sessions but who knows\nmaybe a minute would have been equally\neffective we just there are constraints\non these sorts of studies but the values\nthat she's come up with which seem to be\ngood thresholds for making sure that an\nadaptation response is triggered by heat\nand cold is it ends up being 57 minutes\nper week total of uncomfortable but safe\nheat in that case sauna and that can be\nall in one session or breaking it up\ninto a couple of sessions on the same\nday or different days and then 11\nminutes per week of cold either in one\nsingle session or multiple sessions\nagain one could do more\num one could break that up over you know\nmultiple days or do it all in one day or\ndo it all in one you know an hour in the\nsauna and then 11 minutes in the colder\nvice versa although that seems a little\nbit extreme especially for the\nuninitiated but those are the numbers\nthat have been studied but as you point\nout there are not a lot of really\nthorough studies examining different\ncold protocols according to temperature\nby time requirements so there is a bit\nof subjective feel required to establish\na routine and I would actually say this\nis another time to re-emphasize\nsomething we talked about at the\nbeginning of our conversation which is\nthat pain itself is not a defined\noutcome it's heavily influenced by your\nperception and so if you don't feel like\nthey work for you they won't work if you\nfeel like they work fantastic they do so\nit's a challenging field to get really\nobjective data on so there's always\ngoing to be a little bit of\nsubjective nature to some of these\nthings I can tell you anecdotally we've\nused hot and cold contrast for a long\ntime with athletes some love it some\ndon't care for it and everything in\nbetween so it's one of those things\nwhere\nI never mandate it of course I can't\nmandate anything for anyone I work with\nbut I'm never you know like hey are you\ninterested great you're struggling this\narea do you want to try this you did and\nyou liked it great you're struggling in\nthis area and you tried it you didn't\nlove it okay fine I'm not we'll find\nother routes as we will get into there's\na lot of ways to enhance recovery\num this is only one and it hasn't even\nreally come down to stopping the problem\nin the first place we're not we're just\ntreating symptoms\nwhich is first line of defense but you\nreally need to go back and figure out\nwhy it's happening to begin with as a\nsolution these are just different again\nacute symptom management tactics\none final point about uh deliberate cold\nexposure I think worth mentioning is one\nof the reasons the shower is effective\nbut not nearly as effective as cold\nwater immersion or immersion in ice up\nto the neck is simply because of the\nreason you stated before which is that\nmost showers are not going to get that\ncold you're not going to get down you\nknow into the sub 40s also\ncold showers haven't really been studied\nthat much they have but not nearly as\nmuch as immersion and people always ask\nwhy just think about the challenges of\nstudying cold water exposure in the\nshower where you can't really control\nfor mango how much of the body is\ncovered whether or not the head stays\nunder different size bodies\nEtc whereas when people come into a\nlaboratory they can get into a cold\nlarge and we know where the neck is we\nknow where the chin is and we can make\nsure that people's arms and um legs are\nunderneath but with cold shower sure you\ncan make everyone face away or toward\nthe shower but it's really tricky and\num for all the variations that were\ndescribed that said would you agree that\nif one wants to use deliberate cold\nexposure that cold shower is better than\nnothing and cold immersion in\ncirculating cold water or ice bath is\nbetter than um than cold shower yeah\nwhat I'd actually say if you're looking\nfor recovery for muscle soreness I would\nsay cold shower is probably doing very\nlittle because you're not going to be\nable to get enough cold water onto any\nmuscle besides basically your head\nso maybe you could try a cold bath\nand so you'd at least get some surface\narea coverage\nbut yeah if you want to use cold shower\nfor all the other awesome reasons to\ncold shower that's totally great but if\nyou're trying to use that to recover\nyour low back and glutes from being sore\nfrom training in a good way it's\nprobably not going to do much the the\nimmersion would be there you actually\nalso hit a sneaky other point which is\nif you can't get your water super cold\njust make the water move so if you have\nJets and stuff you can turn on and\nanyone who's tried this and be like okay\nI can do a 40 degree bath awesome try 60\nwhen the water is moving right because\nyou break up the thermal layer normally\nyou have a little thin layer of water\nthat you're heating up you break that up\nit's a whole new world yeah absolutely\nso being very still in the cold water is\nactually the weaker way to go correct\nthat you can make your face stoic but\nmake your body circulate some water\naround you as long as we're on this\nmaybe just one more point about heat\nuh I've certainly used sauna wet sauna\ndry sauna steam saunas excuse me\njacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh\nmales if you are looking to conceive in\nthe 60 days following uh uh following\nsauna or\num hot tub do realize that it that both\nthose approaches do severely limit the\nnumber of motile sperm um substantially\nso for people that are not trying to\nconceive uh don't think that this works\nreliably enough that you could use it as\na form of contraception yeah but but for\npeople that are trying to conceive it\nreally is detrimental to sperm Health\nright and so for that reason some people\nbring an ice pack and put it on the\ngroin or near the groin when they go in\nbut um which is hard to do in a hot tub\nthan a sauna so here we're getting into\nthe fine points\num or crude points if you will pun\nintended but um but the idea is that we\nwe wouldn't want anyone to approach\nthese techniques and compromise their\nother life goals certainly not allowed\nanywhere near these things when uh we\nwere at that stage of Life I'll just say\nthe Natasha put an x on me hanging out\nwith Laird so\nfor those reasons she's like you're not\ngoing in you're not going none of this\nstuff and I just had to wait right heat\num heat and sperm have have a\nrelationship but it's not one that's\npositive for the sperm I'd like to take\na brief break to acknowledge our sponsor\ninside tracker inside tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals I've\nlong been a believer in getting regular\nblood work done for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long-term health and\nwell-being can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test one issue with a lot\nof blood tests and DNA test out there\nhowever is that you get information back\nabout various levels of lipids and\nhormones and metabolic factors Etc but\nyou don't know what to do with that\ninformation inside tracker makes knowing\nwhat to do with all that information\nexceedingly easy they have a\npersonalized platform that lets you see\nwhat your specific numbers are of course\nbut then also what sorts of Behavioral\ndo's and don'ts what sorts of\nnutritional changes what sorts of\nsupplementation would allow you to bring\nthose levels into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nany of inside tracker's plans again\nthat's inside tracker.com huberman to\nget 20 off are there ways to combine\nthe various types of stimuli that you\ndescribed for inducing recovery you\ntalked about breathing based tools which\nwhile they could adjust and indeed do\nadjust oxygen and carbon dioxide ratios\nand\nEtc I'm guessing the major effect of\nthose on recovery is going to be neural\nit's going to be deliberate calm of the\nnervous system more sympathetic based uh\nas you mentioned yeah most definitely\nand then you talked about some movement\nbased and touch-based approaches\num which will uh movement circulate\ncertainly will circulate blood but also\nwill generate contractions of the\nmuscles yep right which maybe if indeed\nagain it still speculates you if indeed\nsome of the soreness is due to excessive\nstretch or swelling at the stretch ends\nof the of the muscles\nthat would make sense so movement and\ntouch and then thermal are there ways to\nto combine these\num that are more effective or maybe even\nsynergistic yeah I suppose you could\nthrow on uh\nsome compression garments put on a\nPneumatic compression device and sit in\nthe sauna while you down regulate your\nbreath like that would be fine\nquite honestly though you probably don't\nneed\nto maximize all of them we were joking\nyou could probably go for a light swim\nwhile regulating your breathing in cold\nwater you get the compression from the\ncold water and and you'd be in a good\nspot so you could certainly do that the\nreality of it is I generally look for\nsome physical\napproach and then some holistic approach\nof the breath work basically so I want\nbreath and then something else if you\nknock those two things out you're in a\ngood spot so that could be breath while\nyou're in thermal stress so just\ncontrolling and doing the unregulation\nstuff you have to also remember ice is a\nstressor\nand I'll actually show you some data\nhere in a second about\nhow that actually can enhance\nsystemic recovery although it won't\nhappen in the in the acute minutes in\nfact it's going to take at least 30 to\n60 minutes and then you'll eventually\nsee a rebound effect but acutely it's\ngoing to make you actually more\nsympathetic which is going the other\ndirection he can do the opposite or it\ncan actually drive you up so it's a\nlittle bit dependent upon how you\nrespond what time of day and how you're\nusing so in general I guess combining\nthem is\nif you need it\num\ndepending on what you have what's\navailable so perhaps you don't have a\nsauna but you can take a hot bath great\nmaybe you have some percussion device\nsome tool and you can use that but you\ndon't have a sauna amazing I don't have\nice bath these things so I think rather\nthan thinking about an optimal\ncombination of them I would say just use\na couple of the tactics based on what\nyou have and what is\neasily available in your situation I'd\nlove for you to teach us about some of\nthe methods for longer form recovery as\nit relates to overreaching and over\ntraining sure you want to think about\nthis in a couple of phases phase one is\nto try to prevent it from happening in\nthe first place\nuh in terms of training load you're\ngoing to just go back to our previous\nepisodes where we talk give you specific\ninstructions for how much to increase\nyour volume and intensity per week Etc\nthe other thing you can do then is do\nsome monitoring and I'll go over some\ndifferent tools some cost free ones as\nwell as some some higher technologically\ndemanding ones to monitor to see if it's\nactually happening and then the third\napproach here is what if this has\nalready occurred I figured it out I'm so\nhow do I get back out of that hole so I\nwould like to just sort of tackle these\none by one in order and talk about\nwhat's happening what tools you can use\nand why they're going to work all right\nso anytime we're talking about fatigue\nmanagement here\nmost people are aware of these terms\nbecause if you have any sort of\nTechnology you're probably getting some\nsort of Readiness score or recovery\nscore or strain depending on which app\nor watch or Tech you have you have a\nlittle bit of vernacular change if\nyou're in the sport performance world\nyou might be looking at things again\nlike load or a GPS tracking and\nmonitoring and really all of it is is\ndoing the same thing\nit's trying to either one\npredict\na problem is going to happen in a future\nand then placing restrictions upon you\nso that you don't run into that\nsituation\nthe other thing is possibly doing is\nidentifying a drop in physiology or\nperformance and then saying we need to\nget you out of this hole that's really\nwhat's happening and so when we think of\nthe first one just imagine a scenario\nlike a mileage limitation uh pitch count\nin baseball and what has happened there\nis is you know individuals in those\nfields have looked and said hey what we\nnotice is people who throw say more than\n100 pitches in a game\ntend to start losing Effectiveness and\nincrease injury rate therefore we're\npredicting the next time you go to play\nif you cross that threshold we start\nhaving an increased risk of negative\nconsequences so therefore we're going to\ncap your in this case pitching volume at\nthat hundred pitches per game or\nwhatever the case same thing with\nrunning etc etc so you could just simply\ndo that and there's actually really cool\ndata coming out now on sport performance\nstuff looking at things like I am using\nGPS trackers and trying to identify even\nposition by position specific\nrecommendations for how much distance\nyou should cover in a practice in a\ntrending session\num so that you can say hey these\npositions don't cross this threshold\nthese positions don't cross this\nthreshold in basketball and tennis and\nall kinds of things like that that's not\nprobably extremely applicable to many of\nthe listeners right now but it is still\nconveying the idea that if we understand\nwhere we break then we can stop\nourselves from getting there in the\nfirst place\nthe functional example here is just\nthinking about basic things like where\ndo I start my training program and then\nhow do I progress it and we've already\ncovered those numbers in either case\nthough you want to have three markers\nthat you're paying attention to if\nyou're concerned you're getting into an\noverreaching phase or potentially going\nto lead to over training or you want to\nget out as three unique things number\none\nwe're going to look for some sort of\nperformance metric right so this could\nbe your times are going down your your\nsquat numbers your your power is going\ndown any of these things so it's got to\nbe an actual performance number two some\nsort of physiology and so I want to see\nsomething happening with resting heart\nrate some biomarker is moving heart rate\nvariability some other measure that is\nnot influenced by you and the beauty of\nusing biological markers are if we\ncontrast that to like performance\nand I said okay here's our performance\ntest every day you come in you're going\nto do a vertical jump\nand if one day you come in all of a\nsudden your vertical jump is super low\nI might think oh man maybe we're\nstarting to overreach\nyou also could be feeling lazy that day\nand just not have jumped very high on\npurpose because you didn't want to work\nout\nthe beauty of biomarkers are you don't\nget to manipulate them like that they\ndon't care there's a downside to it\nwhich is maybe they're just indirect\nmarkers right and so\nI'm not telling you biological markers\nare better than performance markers what\nI'm saying is you want to look at both\nall right in fact you want to look at\nour third category as well\nwhich is some sort of symptomology\nand so am I am I having a symptom of\noverreaching\nam I seeing a performance Sacrament and\nthen am I saying a biological marker as\nwell if you see all three of these\npopping up you have reason to believe\nyou've reached some overt reaching\nnow what you have not identified yet is\nif that is functional overreaching\nnon-functional overreaching or true over\ntraining and remember you shouldn't be\nfeeling great after every training\nsession you're trying to cause\nadaptation and until you back off maybe\neven weeks or months later to actualize\nthe adaptation and get that super\ncompensation and performance increase\nyou're going to have to invest a little\nbit so you're going to go in the hole\nany sport performance coach is going to\nlook at numbers throughout the year and\nsay yeah when we first start training in\npreparation for the season we are going\nto see a drop in performance that day\nthat week that's part of the plan though\nright that's the stress you're trying to\naccumulate so you want to see all three\nof those markers you just want to pay\nattention to a couple of things how long\nare they down for\na day three days seven days 15 days\nEtc if you're seeing a performance drop\nin a day\nand I am far away from from performance\nuh so the day that I want to Peak for\nI'm not going to do anything different\nif I see two days in a row drop\nperformance\nI'm not worried if I see more than\nprobably in my opinion five days in a\nrow of decrement then I might start\npaying attention\nif you're in season though or close to\ncompetition or whatever that thing means\nto you\nand you see more than a couple of days\nin a row of dropping then you might\nactually want to take some some steps to\nmitigate that so it really is important\nyou understand again what are we trying\nto do are we trying to cause adaptation\nare we trying to cause adaptation and I\nI have a very specific example of all\nthis we can run through uh here in a\nsecond and then of course a bunch of\ntools to to pull you out of those phases\nbut that's that's fundamentally what\nwe're trying to do here I would\nencourage you again\ndon't be too reactive and responsive to\nany one measure I'm going to cover a\nwhole bunch of them in a second\nbut you can get lost in in different\nthings because they all have pros and\ncons and so\nI know it's simple to just look at one\nscore in your watch and make your\ndecisions because of that or check your\napp but you really want to be careful of\ndoing that you're going to probably lead\nyourself in the wrong direction more\noften than you're going to help yourself\nI'm curious as to why when we overreach\ntoo much or too often where we are over\ntraining\nthat performance is diminished because\non the face of it it's kind of obvious\nyou're overreaching you're over training\nso performance is diminished but that's\ncompletely circular\nyou hear about things like adrenal\nfatigue and adrenal burnout well it\nturns out adrenal burnout doesn't even\nreally exist absolutely not there is a\nsuch a thing as adrenal insufficiency\nsyndrome but of course you know these\nphrases like burn out adrenal burnout\nover training\num they're thrown around it you know as\nmuch as words like gaslighting and\nobsessive compulsive you know are\nwithout any real clinical definition\num or there are clinical definitions but\npeople aren't obeying them when they use\nthe language I do want to acknowledge\nhowever what is absolutely true which is\nthat overreaching too much too often\nover training these can degrade\nperformance\nbut mechanistically speaking what's\ngoing on because I think if once we\nunderstand what's going on\nmechanistically then I think we can all\nlook at tools whether or not it's\nbreathing movement compression thermal\npsychological motivational\nEtc and have a much clearer sense as to\nwhat's going to work best and what\nlikely won't work\nI love this question so much because as\nI mentioned at the beginning I I was\nfortunate to spend my some of my\ngraduate work in Andy Fry's Lab at the\nUniversity of Memphis and we did a lot\nin this area and so we in fact this is\nhow I learned how to do assays and run\nWestern blots and measure signaling\nproteins and things like this so this\nstuff is near and dear to my heart we\nalso did a bunch of really wild studies\nand he had done some before I got there\nso\nI'm gonna combine kind of antifrey's\nentire career and just highlight some of\nthe big pictures of what he found there\num he was very interested in exercise\nparticularly strength training and\ntrying to figure out this entire\nquestion right which is like why is this\nactually happening when I work out too\nmuch when I lift too much\nthat all of a sudden I can't sleep\nwhat's happening like why is my energy\ndown why is my mood my motivation\nreduced if I squat too much so we did a\nwhole series of studies across this\ncareer and again I'll just sort of\nhighlight some of the the\nsome of the themes that ran through them\nso the first one that jumps out to mind\nis early in his career he did this\nreally awesome protocol\num where he had people squat 100 of\ntheir back squat Max every day for two\nweeks\nso you're coming to the gym and I think\nthis first one was on a machine and you\ndid a one rep max and you came back in\nevery single day for two weeks so these\nare what we would generally call kind of\nlike that short to moderate range\noverreaching and by definition some of\nthem end up actually being true over\ntraining because it would take the\nindividuals sometimes two to up to eight\nweeks to return back to their one rep\nmax at the end of these protocols\num so some of them were non-functional\noverreaching or some combination of that\nwell along with that he took a lot of\nblood samples as well as muscle biopsies\nto try to look at what's happening\nendocrinologically\nneurologically muscle physiology wise to\npay attention what's happened so a\ncouple of things that jump out there one\nof his initial studies actually I think\nthe very first one he did when they ran\nthat first\nsquat everyday protocol\nwhat they found is catecholamine levels\nchange quite significantly and depending\non kind of what you wanted to pay\nattention to there whether it was\nepinephrine or norepinephrine or even\nsome other markers they basically\nincreased by somewhere between two to\nthreefold and so a little bit of\nunderstanding of sleep physiology if\nadrenaline is extremely high epinephrine\nyou're going to have a hard time\nsleeping so that alone was was first\nindication this is like wait a minute\nsomething's actually happening here\nthat's just beyond muscle soreness\nthere's some sort of systemic fatigue\nhappening and as you rightfully pointed\nout is not the adrenal glands becoming\nfatigued that's sort of a bit of\ntongue-in-cheek at pedantics it is\ncortisol dysregulation and general\nstress syndrome\nbut it's really can be noted in in blood\nin terms of epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine another study he had done\nof a similar realm was over the course\nof seven and a half days that people\ncame in and did 15 training sessions so\nit was really cool these are these\nreally short bouts of just ridiculous\ntraining and they said okay like\nsomething's happening with\nwith epinephrine and norepinephrine\nsomething hap something's happening with\ntestosterone what's it look like inside\nthe cell so now muscle biopsies came on\nboard\nand they started looking at things like\nmap kinases which are these signaling\nproteins that are tend to be associated\nwith an anabolic response say upregulate\nmuscle protein synthesis and they do\nmany other things but that's like a big\nfactor of them they looked at various\nandrogens and glucocorticoid receptors\nand they wanted to say like well maybe\nreceptor density or and or sensitivity\nis changing and in fact surprise\nsurprise that's exactly what they found\nso they found both Androgen and\nglucocorticoid receptor concentrations\nwere reduced and so you can start to see\na picture forming which is like hmm\nvery similar to the insulin type 2\ndiabetes story where you've you've\nreally put yourself in a very high\nstress situation so presumably\nepinephrine\nEtc testosterone releases are extremely\nhigh in response to that to try to reach\nback to some level of homeostasis you\nstart down regulating The receptors for\nthem and so it's like the signal can\nonly get so high if you're going to keep\nthat gas on we're going to pull back the\nthrottle and the receptor so that the\ntotal signal stays the same if that\nmakes a little bit of sense\nwell that becomes obviously problematic\num so then like a final follow-up study\nhere that is important to note is they\ndid another protocol which was really\nreally cool and they said the first ones\nweren't enough so how about this we're\ngoing to come in every day for two weeks\nand we're going to do 10 sets\nof a one rep max every day\nso they were coming in and they would do\n10 one rep Maxes every day for two weeks\nand what's really cool about that study\nif they didn't complete\nany other repetitions they had to repeat\nit until they had 10 successful one rep\nMaxes on that given day\num absolutely brutal brutal protocol I\nwasn't there at the time\num they had finished that right before I\ngot on campus but I was actually able to\nbe around when they were doing some of\nthe final analyzes there of the tissue\num what they want to look at in this\nparticular study was beta adrenergic\nreceptors which are those receptors were\nthat are going to be epinephrine and\nsuch are going to be binding for so\nagain similar story here\num perhaps are we losing overall\nsensitivity because of this extreme\nsympathetic stimulation now actually\nthinking back what would have been\npretty cool is if they had another group\nthat did it and then did some down\nregulation breathing post to see if that\ncan ameliorate some of the problems but\nno of course this was 20. plus years ago\nor something like that so\na couple of things that happened is the\none rep Maxes dropped by I think around\nlike eight kilos by the end of the two\nweeks if I remember right like the group\naverage was something in the\nneighborhood of 151 kilos so these were\npretty well trained individuals and it\nwent from rather I think actually it was\nabout 160 kilos and they dropped to like\n152 kilos it's something close to that\nwhat was more significant though was\ntheir power dropped by 35 percent\nwhich is really really interesting\nbecause if if you pay attention to\ndeclines in physical performance over\ntime and I mean that like through aging\nwhat you'll see is people can hold on to\nmuscle mass pretty well\nit will go down by about you know one\npercent or so after the age of 40.\nhowever strength will go down at like\ntwo to four percent and then Power by\neight to ten percent and if you look at\nactually World Records across strength\nSports by age you'll see that they will\ndecline\nby age but not that much however if you\nlook at Speed Sports\nby age they fall off the planet so it's\nvery challenging to preserve fast\nThrough Time whether this is fatigue or\nbecause of age that's really important\nbecause that'll then tell you hey a\nlittle bit of a canary in the coal mine\nis not necessarily your strength but\nyour speed\nand so a lot of different techniques\nthat we use\nto measure performance remember that's\nour Triad right symptomology physiology\nand performance you're generally better\nlooking at speed based performance tests\nrather than strength based performance\ntests to get an earlier indication of\npotential overreaching or over training\nso anyways back to the the individual\nstudy there\num in that same group again we have the\nsame problem where it took some of them\ntwo to eight weeks to come back so what\nthey had to do is I can't remember the\nexact time frame I probably should have\nthought through this but they had they\nhad to come back something like every\nweek or every couple of days even after\nthe study finished until they got back\nto their Baseline one rep max and some\nof them it took them up to eight weeks\nbefore they finally got back so they\nprobably were in a classic uh over\ntraining State at that place which is\nwas done in as little as two weeks and\nthis is also another point that\npeople always ask like how uh like how\nlong does it take is this something that\nhas to happen over the course of months\nor like if I were to go do two days or\nthis intense training camp for two or\nthree weeks could I actually cause over\ntraining and the answer is if it is\nactually truly enough volume and enough\nintensity you probably can do some\nsignificant damage in as little as two\nweeks probably doesn't happen that often\nmost likely you you're probably going to\nbe reaching a state of non-functional\noverreaching but you may actually be\nable to put yourself in a position where\nit might take three or four weeks or\nmore to get back to Baseline after a\ntruly intense and again think about this\nprotocol it's like totally unrealistic\nfor the most part 10 sets of one of a\none rep max squat every day for two\nstraight weeks um some folks\nif you're extremely highly trained\nweightlifter you might do something like\nthat when you're very close to say World\nChampionships but outside of that really\nspecific scenario it's a totally absurd\ntraining protocol but that was the point\nright we were trying to ensure\nuh ensure that over training was met or\nclose it's similar to when we've done\nand we've actually done I think three\nstudies in the center for support\nperformance on Dom's muscle soreness and\nin all those cases you do just like\nridiculous leg extension protocols\nbecause you're just trying to ensure you\ncause super soreness if you don't then\nyou have nothing to study so\num absurd training protocols but but\nthat's the point so nonetheless\num as a result sure enough the beta\nadrenergic receptors were down regulated\nby something like 37 percent\num what's probably even more significant\nthough was the sensitivity in those\nreceptors was reduced by like two and a\nhalf fold and so it's like okay wait a\nminute we're becoming desensitized in\nthis timeline and we're also actually\nnow starting to reduce our total\nconcentration\nsimilar which is actually an interesting\nit was a very sneaky smart thing to do\nis they looked at nocturnal urinary\nepinephrine and guess what that was also\nup by like 50 percent\n15 one five five zero five zero yeah and\nso now you're seeing this tie-in where\nit's like\num\nI'm seeing a response at the tissue\nlevel I'm seeing a response probably\nalthough they didn't actually look at\npituitary anything like that I'm seeing\nadrenal and other endocrinological\nproblems and then I'm also seeing this\nincrease in concentration of Ben\nepinephrine when I'm supposed to be\nsleeping and surprise surprise I'm\nhaving a hard time\nsleeping symptomology that's a very\ninteresting finding about nocturnal\nepinephrine epinephrine of course is\nadrenaline it's released from the\nadrenals no surprise there but also from\nthis brain area called Locus ceruleus\nand the brain and the Brain tends to be\ncalled epinephrine in the body\nadrenaline just to complicate everyone's\nunderstanding but that nomenclature did\nnot come from us so don't blame us\nthe point is that\nrapid eye movements lead so called REM\nsleep\nis more abundant in the second half of\nthe night we know that the dreams\nassociated with rapid eye movement sleep\nare more emotionally Laden and that\nthose dreams and those emotional states\nare actually important for discarding\nthe emotional load of previous day's\nexperiences it's a sort of a natural\ntrauma therapy if you will because in\nthe normal healthy state\nthose dreams are associated within the\ninability to release epinephrine at\nnight so for me what you just described\nfirst of all it's the first time I've\never heard of it\num\nbut it ties together something really\nquite clear from the Sleep Neuroscience\nliterature which is that\nwhen people are stressed they tend to\nget less rapid eye movement sleep\nthat rapid eye movement sleep normally\nis associated with low levels of\nepinephrine so whether or not it's\ncausal or not isn't clear but sort of\ndoesn't matter for sake of this\ndiscussion but what I'm wondering and I\nsuppose one could test for but maybe\nobserved is whether or not people who\nare over in over training too much over\nreaching too much because of this\nelevated nocturnal epinephrine\ndiminished REM sleep whether or not\ntheir emotional state is also\num disrupted because one thing we know\nfor sure is if you want to disrupt\nsomebody's emotional state you deprive\nthem of sleep and rap and eye movement\nsleep in particular the one caveat to\nthat is\nfor those of you out there that have\nheard that rapid eye movement sleep\ndeprivation deliberate rapid eye\nmovement sleep deprivation\nis a treatment for depression that is\ntrue but it's coupled with a next night\nenhanced rapid eye movement sleep so one\nof the major takeaways from all of this\nuh that I'm realizing is that\nno surprise daytime activities impact\nnighttime endocrine function impact\nquality of sleep impact daytime\nactivities yeah actually there's so many\nfun things I want to do here now um this\nis actually why measuring eye movement\nis a very fantastic tool for\nunderstanding total stress load and you\ncan actually differentiate different\ntypes of stress so caffeine use versus\nalcohol use versus sleep deprivation by\nactually measuring eye movements that's\nactually what we do in our absolute rest\nsleep company is in addition to getting\na full PSD sleep study done in your\nbedroom you're going to get an eye\ntracking assessment which we're going to\nbe able to figure out why you're getting\nthere so\num nonetheless\nyeah if you actually look at the classic\nsigns and symptoms of over training or\nover training syndrome it's going to be\neverything from performance decrements\nlike we talked about\num heart resting heart rate is going to\nincrease you're going to see things like\nHRV drop by generally 20 or so percent\nthat would be a very large disruption in\nHRV\ndecreased body weight and then all the\nstuff Andrew you just talked about so\nmotivation adherence appetite mood\nall of this stuff are classically known\nassociations with with overtrain and\nthat's for the exact reasons you're\ntalking about sleep disturbances and\ndisruptions\nwanting to train motivation all of this\nstuff uh goes part and parcel with\nnon-functional overreaching and or over\ntraining you can actually tie this back\nin a little bit more to some other\nbiomarkers and this is this is great\nbecause this is the stuff we look for\nthis is the physiology stuff we look for\num you've probably talked about shpg\nbefore which is a sex hormone binding\nglobulin so it's this protein that\nthat'll float in your body that's\ngoing to bind up sex hormones in\nparticular testosterone so what happens\nwith\num over training is you can actually\ntake this serially like week by week and\nyou will actually see this number rise\nand so if you see this like say you're\nusing a a service like inside tracker\nand you're getting your your blood\nmeasured every so often and you see this\nnumber start ticking up\nthis is actually associated with that\nbecause what's actually happening is\nit's binding up all your free\ntestosterone and that's just leading\nback to the circle we're talking about\nand you can actually see the same thing\nhappen with calorie restriction\ndoes not eat enough calories but in this\nparticular case because it actually\nhappens in both scenarios you know it's\nnot an issue simply of being under\ncaloried it's clearly an issue of the\ntraining load being too high so just to\ngive another little tool there's I can\nget the link for it but there's a\nwebsite that was created by which\nJournal uh I'm slipping but I'll get it\nto you you can link it up where you can\nactually go in and plug in\na number of values for mud chemistry so\nif you got your blood work done and you\ncan plug in your pre-number and your\npost number so say you got it done and\nthen maybe 10 weeks later you got it\ndone again and you're wondering and you\nnotice hey my free testosterone's down\nor my shpg is up\nis it actually a meaningful number and\nyou it will actually tell you whether or\nnot the change prediposed is\nphysiologically Meaningful or not or\njust within the error margin of the\nmeasure and you can actually change like\nright there on the website you can\nchange your confidence interval so it's\nreally really cool if you know if you\njust have your own blood and you want to\nknow like hey I had any level this year\nand now it's you know here over there\nit's a totally free resource created\ngone through peer review all that stuff\nand I'll give the link to that so that's\na pretty cool\nmeasure in addition to that like\nprobably one of the more powerful and\neasy metrics uh biologically is to take\nyour cortisol and DHEA ratio so this is\nknown to be associated with a lot of\nthings you want to be really careful you\ndon't want this number to be too high or\ntoo low something like 0.09\nit is about cortisol to DHEA DHA to\ncortisol ratio DHEA to cortisol I'd love\nto tell you I said it backwards on\npurpose just to make sure everyone\nunderstood but I got it backwards yeah I\nmean this ratio has been associated with\nso many things you have to do you do\nhave to be careful with Association\nright not being causation but everything\nfrom risk of infections the metabolic\nhealth and and like other disease States\nas well as more what we're talking about\nwhich is hey Mike am I am I getting sort\nof cortisolous Regulation which is what\na lot of folks would call\nyou know again adrenal fatigue and no\nthat's not really what's happening but\nif adrenaline and epinephrine are off\nand testosterone cortisol is going to be\nalong the right and so you can also look\nat things like testosterone to cortisol\nratios so there's a lot of things you\ncan glean here to give you some insights\ninto where you're going if that if that\nratio is too high that's going to be\nassociated with metabolic syndrome and a\nbunch of other stuff if it's too low\nthat's going to be associated with a lot\nof cognitive problems like aggression\nand mood and a bunch of things like that\nso\nagain you want to keep it right around\nthat 0.09 ratio and most the time\nactually in some blood chemistry stuff\nyou'll get a you'll get a report of that\nor you can calculate it pretty quickly\nI'm sure we'll get into this in the\nepisode that comes next on uh nutrition\nand supplementation totally\nwhat about compounds that lower cortisol\nsuch as ashwagandha\num I can see now based on the logic\nyou're spelling out that during phases\nof\na lot of intense overreaching or\nfrequent overreaching\ngiven that those compounds can indeed\nlower cortisol radoli rodolia rosacea\nrhodiola rhodiola rosacea\num one word to say\num two words but the first one more fun\nto say rhodiola Rhodesia rhodiola rosea\nrhodiola rosea folks and ashwagandha\num I've been\nuh\ntrying rhodiola recently\num and mainly as a buffer to Output\num it does seem to have some good data\nattached to it related to lowering uh\none's perceived threshold of how hard\nthey're working so in other words you\ncan work harder and not feel as if\nyou're working really hard which allows\nyou to do more work that's sort of the\nsubjective description of how it works\nbut you told me that it um Can blunt\ncortisol and ashwagandha we know\nblonde's cortisol both of these things\nof course can do other things but are\nthese\num compounds that you sometimes will\nincorporate into a training regimen uh\nI've been using rhodiola for probably\nsix or more years like pretty\nconsistently not personally but using it\nwith the individual you work with you do\nneed to be a little bit careful I\nwouldn't say that it blunts cortisol it\nis probably more purpley described as a\ncortisol modulator\nuh which means sort of if it's too high\nor too low it'll help kind of keep it\nwithin normative range\num there's also there is important to\nnote\nthere have been a handful of studies at\ntwo of I know specifically\nshowed that uh rhodiola use kind of\nhands strength gains\nhowever it may reduce muscular endurance\nso we need more human data on this stuff\nand it may turn out that's not a concern\nit may also turn out to be a concern so\nnothing is nothing is perfect and free\nthere's no supplement that is a Panacea\nand um I have used again really in a lot\nof situations because the other thing\nyou kind of have to pay attention to the\ncortisol is is you ha it's supposed to\nbe modulated throughout the day it's not\nsupposed to be at this normal now in\nfact if you look at the normative values\num it's typically uh described in uh\nmicrograms per deciliter and depending\non literally what company used to draw\nyour blood if you're getting it through\nthe blood depending on what which method\nthey use to analyze it the normative\nvalues are like frankly embarrassingly\nall over the place\num they're mostly going to be like 5 to\n25 as a quote unquote normative value\nbut that's outrageous we also know\nthose numbers vary massively by age\nby sex and throughout the day and so if\nyou only are taking a single point let's\nassume you're doing a fasted blood draw\nwhich is what most folks do it's really\nonly going to tell you a lot about\nwhat's happening in that moment we need\nto know well like maybe let's say my\ncortisol was if I'm a say 38 year old\nwoman and my 7am cortisol was\n15 milligrams per deciliter that's\npretty good but if it's 15 milligrams\nper deciliter at 3 pm oh boy I'm I'm\nprobably having some issues right so\nthere's a change throughout the day and\nyou need to be able to plot that curve\nso you can actually well pretty standard\npractice that we do is we look at\ncortisol throughout the day we're going\nto take multiple markers because I don't\nwant to just see your Baseline cortisol\nI want to see this curve throughout the\nday that's going to tell me a ton about\nagain as your sleep being caused by this\nregulation is it your training is it\nsomething else so I would like take a\nsingle Baseline blood marker of cortisol\nwith a lot of grain of salt we would\ntypically measured at least three times\nthroughout the day so something like six\nto nine a.m twelve to three and then\nsomething like closer to the evening\noftentimes we do much more we'll do like\nseven points or something like that\nthroughout the day depending on the\nsituation so you want to be careful of\nthat\num just since we're here you can also\nget cortisol in uh through saliva and\nnow the sort of pros and cons to that\nbecause the the pro of doing it in your\nblood\nis it's it it's much more stable\num saliva is extremely responsive to\nwhatever happened these seconds before\nyou took that test the upside of it\nthough is you can do a bunch of real\nworld life experiments so for example we\nwill do this sometimes if we want to see\nhow an individual is responding to a\ngiven stressor let's take it right let's\ntake it take it in the you know spin\ninto the tube we're going to take it and\nwe're going to go do this workout or\nthis cold exposure whatever we're going\nto do take it at the end we know that\nit's responsive to what just happened\nbut that's the point\num so you can actually there's sort of\npros and cons so you'll use the\nappropriate measure for the appropriate\nuh question you're trying to answer a\ncouple of points and Reflections about\ncortisol my first uh laboratory Duty was\nan undergraduate was in a was actually\nin a biopsychology lab at the time they\ndidn't have the field of Neuroscience as\nit's now called it was called\nbiopsychology or psychobiology I didn't\nknow that no there was used to be\nneurochemistry neurobiology they had all\ncollapsed into what we call now called\nNeuroscience which was only some years\nago but my job was to collect cortisol\nsamples which means I I was collecting\num spit which means I was collecting\nsaliva and the advantage of saliva based\ncortisol is free cortisol it's the\nactive form as you mentioned it's\nreflective of what happened in the\nseconds or minutes\num just prior a couple of things about\nthe regular cortisol pattern across the\nday because I realized that while it\nwould be wonderful for everybody to get\ntheir cortisol measured in detail\nmultiple times in Blood and and saliva\nand so on some people just won't do that\nfor whatever reason or can't do that\nyeah and the basic Contour of a healthy\npattern of cortisol secretion is uh to\nhave highest levels of cortisol in the\nmorning\num is actually part of the mechanism\nthat's associated with waking you up\nviewing bright light ideally from\nsunlight but other forms of bright light\nearly in the day actually can lead to a\n50 percent five zero percent increase in\nthat cortisol Spike which is a good\nthing people hear elevated cortisol oh\nno but this sets in motion a Cascade of\nthings related to enhanced mood and\nalertness immune system function Etc\nwhat I think it can be useful for people\nto understand is that many things will\nSpike cortisol throughout the day stress\ncold water exercise but the idea is that\nit comes down to baseline or near\nBaseline\num rather quickly\none of the worst situations as you\npointed out is when the highest level of\ncortisol is consistently shifted to the\nafternoon period in fact that's a pretty\nreliable signature of certain forms of\ndepression this is worked by my\ncolleague David Spiegel at Stanford\nPsychiatry and the the great Bob\nsapolski Robert sapolsky of uh why\nzebras don't get ulcers behave Etc and\nfame lots of lots of popular books there\num I think that if people are trying to\nregulate their cortisol and they're just\nunder and they just understand that\nbasic Contour that the Baseline should\nbe you know rise pretty quickly after\none rises in the morning so it's easy to\nremember rise rise rise out of bed and\nRise cortisol with light bright light\nwith exercise\num with caffeine these things will all\nincrease cortisol and then across the\nday it's normal for cortisol to spike\nbut then to use some of the down\nregulation methods that you described in\nparticular the breathing methods and\nexercise itself as the case may be but\nthen to really pay attention to how much\npsychological and physical stress is\noccurring in the six hours or so or\neight hours prior to sleep um does that\nseem like a a good sort of broad Contour\nof how to have a healthy pattern of\ncortisol release because you actually\nwant the cortisol to reduce inflammation\nand initiate or participate in the\nrecovery process you will not see any\nprogress\nfrom exercise training without a large\nspike in cortisol\nit is critically important when we think\nof phrases like cortisol inflammation\nstress\nthis is not bad right physiology is not\npersonified right there things don't\nlike ate you in the body right it is all\nis not good and bad they just are\num the more you try to suppress cortisol\nthe more you suppress adaptation what\nyou want is exactly what you mentioned\nlarge spikes met with large quick\nrecovery and you want to do that\nthroughout the day and get that hormetic\nstressor this is so going back to your\nashwagandha and Rhodiola issue um it I\nthink it would be very short-sighted for\npeople that do that as this is a\nprophylactic okay because you if you\nblunt cortisol you're going to cause\nimmunosuppressant especially early in\nthe day totally taking ashwagandha\nbefore going to train is is\ncounterproductive yeah we do not just\nthis is not a baseline part of our\nfoundational package right if you go\nlook at the athlete foundations or the\nathlete resilience protocols that put\ntogether you're not going to see these\nthings in there for that specific reason\num any form of cortisol regulation needs\nto be done strategically if you are\nexcessively high and we're bringing you\nback down to normative values at the\nright time then great if you're normal\nthough\nthen taking you down lower than that is\nactually problematic the same thing is\nactually true since we're here for\noxidative stress for information\nantioxidant use we mentioned I think\nearlier about taking vitamin C and\nvitamin E post exercise will actually\nblunt adaptations or at least has the\npotential to do so same thing right if\nyou're modulating this response\njust because and you have not done so\nbecause\nof actually biological testing that\nindicated you needed to do such then you\nactually may be making things worse and\nso we see this constantly with people\nwho take a number of\nsupplements and substances for sleep\nand then they wake up the next morning\ngroggy and your your cortisol suppressed\nokay great so then they take something\nfor stimulation and then the rest of the\nday they're trying to reduce and then I\nneed this nasty cycle instead of just\ngetting out of the way and letting\ncortisol do what it's supposed to do and\nthen making sure again you're teaching\nit so this is actually a coachable\nresponse you can coach your own body\nto go down in the later part of the day\nand go up in the earlier part of the day\nyou want to make sure that you are\ndriving that train with intent and so\nagain to reiterate if you don't need\nthat you shouldn't do it right if you\ndon't need to lower cortisol you\nshouldn't walk around doing it you're\njust going to suppress the state even\nfar and this is what's needed this is\nneeded for anabolic responses like\nyou're not going to grow muscle if\ncortisol is not spiked it's going to\ncompromise it rather so you want to be\nintentional with these practices\nespecially in the form of of\nsupplementation be very very intentional\nI've heard it said that carbohydrates in\nparticular starchy carbohydrates can\ninhibit cortisol definitely and this\ncould be through the uh tryptophan amino\nacid related pathway that ratchets up to\nuh serotonin release probably some other\nthings too I mean the idea that\ncarbohydrates just stimulate serotonin\nis a little bit uh overly similarious\ncellular mechanisms ampk going up and\nimmediately turning on there yeah right\nso um you know I think we've all\nexperienced this uh you know we're\nstressed we're stressed we doesn't\nnecessarily even have to be highly\nprocessed you know uh fat associ you\nknow fatty carbohydrates\num you know like potato chips and and\npotato chips and dip or these kinds of\nthings it can also be uh polarizable\noatmeal Bowl pasta\num which here I'm not trying to demonize\num carbohydrates I I do ingest\ncarbohydrates\num minimally or non-processed\ncarbohydrates um most of the time but\nnot all the time and they have a fairly\npotent effect on on lowering stress and\nperceived stress and even quality of\nsleep which is not to say that somebody\nhas to load up on them like crazy unless\ntheir glycogen is really depleted talked\na lot about this in the endurance\nepisode I know we'll touch on it more in\nthe nutrition supplementation episode\nbut\num in thinking about the relationship\nbetween carbohydrates and cortisol and\nwhat we've just been talking about in\nterms of cortisol as being vitally\nimportant for the adaptation Trigger or\ntriggering adaptation it's probably a\nbetter way to put it\nbut that it can blunt cortisol\ntaken post training or um maybe in the\nevening before sleep what are some of\nthe basic ways that one can think about\nand maybe use carbohydrates in specific\nways in order to let's say control\ncortisol rather than uh quash cortisol\nuh you actually have alluded to it a\nnumber of times already so we oftentimes\nwill give people a lot of carbohydrates\nat night\nfor some of these reasons you're going\nto feel fantastic a lot of people it\nhelps you sleep both get to sleep and\nstay asleep Sleep Quality you talked\nabout specifically remember think about\nit this way cortisol at its core is an\nenergy signaling molecule it says we are\nin the need for energy\ngreat\num epinephrine's the same way you you'll\nstart seeing for example cortisol will\nliberate\nfree fatty acids put them in the\nbloodstream get you prepared to do\nsomething the problem is if it's\ncontinually elevated throughout the day\nwith no down regulation we start running\ninto issues right so again this is the\ndifferentiation between oh my cortisol\nis slightly elevated all day versus I\nhad a really big big spike after\ntraining I had a really big spike after\na breath protocol Etc and then it went\nback down\nso that being said if you then ingest\ncarbohydrates you are telling it is\nquick to see the signal we have\nnutrients we have energy again\nspecifically carbohydrates therefore\ncortisol can sort of go back down we\ndon't need to be liberating free fatty\nacids and preparing uh the need for fuel\nso you can help yourself go to sleep for\nmany as you pointed out many mechanisms\nactually of why carbohydrates will help\nyou sleep at night\num for some not all people but some\nthat would be one of the relationships\nit has with cortisol great I look\nforward to hearing more about how the\nvarious macronutrients and\nmicronutrients and so-called adaptogens\nthis very mysterious group of yeah yeah\ncompounds you know the word adaptogen\ngets thrown around so much nowadays but\nas long as we're talking about\nadaptation I think that'll be fair play\nfor the uh discussion in the next\nepisode about nutrition and\nsupplementation in my laboratory when we\nstudy stress we use a number of\ndifferent markers subjective reports of\nhow stressed people feel uh heart rate\nmorning heart rate heart rate\nvariability\ncortisol free cortisol and on and on\nwhat are some of the other markers of\nstress as it relates to exercise\nadaptations and Recovery because once\nagain I think we're seeing a lot of\nparallels between the study of\npsychological stress and the study of\nphysical stress as it relates to\nexercise adaptation remember\nin terms of physiology stress is stress\nthis is why we have this cool term of\nvalastatic load or allostasis such that\nit really doesn't matter which system\nyou test for it will reflect overall\nstress you know you mentioned several of\nthem we've got done talking about some\nbiomarkers\nHRV and heart rate are another great\nexample because what you're trying to do\nis this when we were talking about the\nmuscle soreness thing what we were\nreally getting at was\na marker of how do I fix the overuse in\nthat particular muscle now we've really\ntransitioned into Global markers of\noveruse and why these are problematic\nor important to pay attention to rather\nis\nagain these are the indicators that you\ndidn't just work a muscle out too hard\nbut you have actually done something\nwhere you've compromised all of your\nphysiology to a level where you've\ninfluenced a circulating catecholamine\nor something that's going to influence\nmultiple markers now like your sleep and\nyour mood and your behavior so that's\nwhy these things are problematic that\nsaid\nyou could look at resting heart rate not\na bad thing to do however that does have\nmultiple downsides one thing we do know\nis your resting heart rate will Elevate\nwith excessive stress load this actually\ndoesn't matter if it is physical stress\nor psychological stress or a combination\nso you will see that number drift up\nover time here's the downside though\nit's not tremendously sensitive to\nsmaller stressors uh in other words if\nyou were to do something like alcohol is\na very good example you will see your\nresting heart rate Elevate with alcohol\nuse excessive tobacco use and\npsychological stress however if you do\nsomething smaller like hard training\nsessions resting heart rate's not\nsensitive enough to pick that up it will\nactually probably stay the same so for\nthose reasons we don't actually use\nresting heart rate that much we will\ntake it but it's not our primary\nindicator that being said HRV is a\nbetter use so just wear the quickly for\nthose that are not familiar uh your\nheart rate let's say for example you\nyour resting heart rate is 60 beats per\nminute that means every second it's\nbeating it doesn't actually happen on a\nconsistent Rhythm such that it would\nbeat on second one beat on second two\nbeat on second three Etc the rate is\nmore variable so it might go beat\nbeat\nbeat\nthere's a variation in the heart rate\nand at the end of that 60 seconds in\nthis example you would have still\ncompleted 60 beats they just aren't on\nthe exact same pattern well one thing\nthat's actually quite interesting is\nthe amount of variation in your heart\nrate is actually associated with your\noverall sympathetic or parasympathetic\nState such that\na large variation so an arithmic pattern\nis generally more representative of\nbeing more rested and recovered and\nbeing more parasympathetic you'll notice\nduring times of extremely high stress\nyou will be very rhythmic beat beat beat\nb b and so this is a little bit of a of\na confusing idea but a high HRV\nis there indicated of a lot of variation\nmeaning you're pretty recovered a low\nHRV meaning there's not a lot of\nvariation means you're probably pretty\nstressed and wired so it's it's uh\nrelated to heart rate but in my opinion\nit is a significantly better marker\nof that now one thing you want to pay\nattention to if you do this a couple of\nthings there are some accuracy issues\nwith many of the devices basically\neverybody at this point probably has\nsome device\nthat's telling them their hrb what you\ndo not want to do is simply compare your\nnumber to somebody else\nfor a lot of reasons not all of these\nTechnologies are actually even measuring\nthe same thing again some of them are\nactually combining with other metrics\nand calling it your overall Readiness or\nyour recovery and so now we've what\nwe've actually done is made a couple of\nassumptions and then stacked them on a\nwhole host of other assumptions and then\ngiving you a number and you don't know\nwhat that sort of black box score\nactually even represents so I would\ncaution one against taking too much\ninformation from that if you are\nactually measuring HRV even within that\nthere's a lot of ways to calculate it\nthat are not important here so\ndon't necessarily worry about the score\nand then come compare it to yourself but\nnot to others what you will see is if\nyou use similar devices and techniques\nme is hard to find data here but in\ngeneral people that are overweight might\nhave a little bit of a of a lower score\nas in a worse score\nwe need more information on that to be\nclear so\nin large part the best way to use\nsomething like HRV is to measure it\nunder the exact same circumstances\nevery day so whether you're going to use\njust a device on your watch or your\nphone or your bed or anything else or\nare you going to buy a special HRV on it\nit's fine just take that measure at the\nsame time\nmostly this means first thing in the\nmorning\nso you wake up you go to the bathroom\nyou come back down and take your measure\nor something like that you don't uh wait\nsometimes you took it before food then\nafter\nlook at your phone like all these other\nthings that can influence stress so so\ntake I didn't usually take somewhere\nbetween seconds to minutes to record so\nyou want to pay attention to that now\none of the things you'll notice is there\nis a natural change in your HIV that\njust happens and so what you kind of\nreally want to pay attention to is\nI guess answering the question of how\nmuch of a change in HRV has to happen\nfor before I should care and it's hard\nto answer right so let's just say your\nHRV was a hundred I just made that\nnumber up\nwhat if you wake up tomorrow and it's\n99.\nwhat's that mean\nwell I don't know if you wake up\ntomorrow when it's 20. that's probably a\nbad thing well where's that line it's\nhard one thing I would recommend doing\nis taking your HRV for at least a month\nbefore you start using that value to\nmake any changes and you recommend\ntaking it first thing in the morning yep\nalways roughly the same time basically\nunder the same circumstances it doesn't\nhave to be technical in the morning but\nbecause your day\nwill change on most days what you get\ninto that's the most stable\nthing in your life so I would take it\nthen and I would collect it for at least\na day at least a month rather maybe even\nsix weeks and then give yourself\nbasically a running average so what we\nall quite honestly do is uh we will\nactually track it for forever and then\nwhat we always look at is\nwhat does it look like today relative to\nthe last week on average and then what\ndoes that look like to our historical\naverage and we always compare those\nthings and you also want to make sure\nyou compare like to like so in other\nwords\nI generally will not going to worry\nabout today's HRV score relative to\ntomorrow's what I want to look at is\ntoday's relative to this exact same day\nlast week\nnot for athletes but for non-athletes\nthis is very important so imagine don't\nworry about the difference between HRV\nscore and Monday compared to Tuesday\npay attention to Monday compared to last\nMonday and the Monday before that\nthat's because you typically have the\nsame sort of weekly schedule\nand what you don't want to do is say\nlook at Monday's HRV score which is a\nreflection of what happens Sunday\nand compare that to Tuesdays which is\nactually a reflection of what happened\nMonday you probably didn't do the same\nstressors on Sundays Monday so you're\nnot actually comparing the same thing\nbut if you have a General weekly\nschedule you're likely to compare this\nMondays relative to last Mondays because\nthey're both comparing what happened on\nthe previous day so did that sort of\nDistinction make sense absolutely I do\nthe same thing with body weight by the\nway if you're trying to track body mass\ngain or fat loss or something compare\nlike the like you can look at the daily\nchanges but you need to pay attention to\nwhat that normal distribution is so if\nyou kind of do that you know Monday to\nMonday thing that'll give you a rough\narea of saying okay my normal weekly\nvariation is say five so my average is\n100 but I will fluctuate between 95 to\n105. that's my standard deviation is\nsort of a science dorks would call that\nif you start very changing more than\nfive percent\noutside of your normal standard\ndeviation then I'm going to start paying\nattention a little bit and I'm going to\nactually run a little bit of an\nalgorithm on this one\nand so here is my thinking process when\nI get HIV really any metric but HRV is\nthe example we're using first step\ndid I collect good data and what that I\nmean again did I measure it the same way\nI measured every single day or did I get\nup and look at my phone first and I\nrealized oh crap I forgot to take my HRV\nand then I went back and got there so\nsay I had a 15 derivation from my normal\nnumber and then I realized oh yeah\nthat's right I was up super late last\nnight\ndoing whatever okay great I'm going to\nconsider that bad data\nyou didn't good\nif it's bad day then I'm not doing\nanything\nignore and bad data and you throw it out\nyou don't use it if you decide for the\nmost part let's assume it was good data\nokay great then I'm going on in my next\nquestion which is\nit acute in other words is it just today\nright or is it chronic as this is a is\nthis pattern happening for more than\nfive days or at least three out of the\nlast four or something like that three\nminimum is what I like honestly I\ngenerally look at five or more days\nthat's a very big distinction if it is\nsomething that just happened today and\nthe next question I'm going to ask\nmyself is\nand I am that adaptation phase\nam I trying to be in a phase where I'm\ntrying to cause insults of the body that\nit needs to respond with if that is the\ncase I'm just going to ignore it right\nin fact it's almost sometimes a good\nsign hey we are stressing the body and\nit is stressed what we're doing is\nworking\namazing in fact if you don't see that\nit's sort of like maybe we're not doing\nenough to push the pace all right so\nwe're great\nif the answer is no we're in a peeking\nphase\nthen we're actually going to use what I\ncall acute State shifters so this is a\nwhole host of little tricks that I have\nthat can change HRV or any recovery\nmetric within seconds\nagain these are not chronic fixes this\nis just I'm having a bad day today I\nfeel like crap can I make myself feel\nbetter right now and so I kind of call\nthese parlor tricks a lot of the times\nand there's a thousand of them we're\ncertainly not going to go over them but\nI'll give you some examples\num you can pull out first of all\nphysical movement we'll do it you'd be\nstunned I'll just\ndoing some yoga moving around doing some\njumping jacks starting your workout I\nmean you've probably experienced this\nit's sort of cliche in our world at this\npoint but\num if you ever do any serious lifting\nover a serious amount of time there will\nbe days in which you walk in the gym and\nyou feel awful\nand somehow that day you said a lifetime\nPR\noud yeah that's a strange\nstrange phenomena yeah I uh\nI\nI've experienced that more than a few\ntimes\num it's rare the inverse is rare however\nyou feel great you have a horrible\nworkout it happens yeah um and it can\nhappen for any number of different\nreasons but yeah I think the the former\nwhen when isn't feeling very good and\nthen somehow is a terrific workout does\nset a kind of a seed of Doubt as to how\ngood our subjective assessments really\nare which I guess is why we're talking\nabout\num objective assessments yep like HRV\nand remember if it's a single day here\nuh you can even do hard training uh\npeople sort of have this idea like well\nif you get up and your recovery scores\ndown do a lighter day\nthat's probably I can probably never\nmaking that choice to be honest not in\nthis situation remember this is one bad\nday\nand we are in a phase of even trying to\nimprove performance right now like we're\nprobably still training hard you will\nagain often see I felt terrible when I\ntrained super hard and it totally\nchanged my day around this is all can\nhappen\nso exercise is my first love here I'm\nabsolutely breathing any sort of\nupregulation breathing so we talked a\nlot about down regulation breathing\njust do the opposite right and so this\nis when hyperventilation strategies can\nwork instead of accentuating the exhale\nyou accentuate the inhale or you\nrestrict the exhales this is working on\nthe exact opposite situation you can\nalso play little this is where things\nlike music\nmotivational quotes if you're the type\nthat follows people on Instagram that\nmotivate you or can work with these\nthings\num coaching tactics these can be things\nlike\nfinding out or talking about that\nperson's why\num\nyou sort of shared something that a\nmantra you use when you're training hard\nto keep you go better I'm not going to\nask you to share that now but some\npeople have this sometimes right or you\nmay have this conversation with your\nathlete we call this finding out your\nwhy right so finding out like why are\nyou really here what are we doing here\nand a lot of times you'll hear things\nlike\nit's because I grew up poor and I don't\never want to be poor again okay great\nthis is for my children or like any\nnumber of things and you can pull that\nout on these days you need to be really\ncareful that's why I call these parlor\ntricks because when you play that card\ntoo often it starts to lose effect right\nand you can only dig to a whole so often\nbefore it's sort of like a um the same\nthing as with music right if you every\ntime you go to the weight room it's\nblasting death metal at level 10. well\neventually it's not it's no longer\nmotivating right it's no longer helpful\nso you want to deploy these things\nstrategically yeah the the phrase that\ncomes to mind is signal the noise you\nknow the nervous system especially the\ndopamine system and the adrenaline\nsystem which are part of this larger\nsystem called the catecholamine system\nso that's dopamine epinephrine\nnorepinephrine the the get up and go\nfocus on external goals movement\nAssociated it's and on and on that that\nsystem\nresponds best to high signal relative to\nnoise so if you're as you point out\num listening music every time drinking a\nton of caffeine energy drinks\npre-workout nootropics and then you know\nstacking all those things uh sometimes\nrefer this as dopamine stacking\ninformally referred to as dopamine\nstacking you're doing all those things\nand then you know first of all then\nyou're wondering why later that\nafternoon or the next day you're feeling\nlike you're you're under a cloud it's\nobvious you're you're kind of combine\nsystem crashed but it's also that\num you don't necessarily become\ndependent on it it's just that you start\nto wonder whether or not you have the\ninternal mechanisms and motivation to\ntrain without those things and someone\ntends to use them more and more and then\nthey have a diminishing effect over time\nthe rule that I've been\num sort of applying has been I never do\ntwo workouts in a row where I'm stacking\nin stimulants loud music and any kind of\nuh sort of high potency inspiration\nhowever every set in the gym or when I\nrun I really try and be diligent about\nform and attention to what I'm doing the\none exception would be the long duration\nendurance work\npart of the reason I do that work is to\nlet my mind go into states of drifting\nI'm not trying to think in complete\nsentences or even close to it just let\nmy my brain kind of idle at a low hum uh\nand for that reason generally listen to\nsomething that's more of a story or\ndon't listen to anything at all and just\nlet my thoughts kind of spool through\nanyway I don't want to take us too far\noff track but I think this idea of\nsignal to noise will resonate with the\nengineers out there but since most\npeople are likely not Engineers it is\nthe way that the nervous system works\nevidenced by the fact that whatever area\nof your body right now is in contact\nwith a chair or any other surface that's\nbeen in contact with for more than a few\nseconds you forget that it's in contact\nwith it because there's low signal to\nnoise at that point a similar note you\nactually mentioned stimulants basically\nthere whether you're talking caffeine or\nany other stimulant any other cortisol\nmodulators or adaptogens any of these\nthings fall in the category if you're\nnot using them consistently and you're\nhaving a rough day and all of a sudden\nyou throw down 200 mL grams of caffeine\nit's going to change real fast strong\nperformance enhancing effect yeah\nabsolutely and for these reasons right\nso we mentioned a couple of them breath\nwork\num\nfood\nmore calories just eating some food\nsometimes we'll give people like what we\ncall Comfort Foods\nso this is just like hey you're uh you\nknow you're from Georgia and we know you\nlove grits so we're having grits for\nbreakfast oh my great like just\nsomething to change your mood acute\nState shifters\num to alter it\nthe other couple of Tricks here are\nlight so if we know that maybe say\nmultiple people are struggling that day\nmaybe we'll put on the lights extra\nbright we'll bring in some extra things\nand just get it more light in there and\nnot it doesn't even count actually going\noutside and seeing the Sun but perhaps\nwe'll do that\num and then other little tricks that\nI've learned over the years is uh one\nparticular thing I love is literally\ndrawing a line a physical line in the\nground and\nyou look at that line and you say like\nI'm going to train today and I'm going\nto accomplish\nthis effort\nI'm not going to walk past this line and\ninto that training space\nuntil I'm ready to give that effort\nand that may take a minute or 10 or\nwhatever but it's the physical barrier\nis very important to saying like I'm not\njust going to get through it I'm going\nto actually perform the way I want to\nperform\nor I'm not going to do it and I'm not\ngoing to cross this line until I'm ready\nto make that happen all right I really\nlike that tool it also brings to mind\nthe importance of at least thinking\nabout how your relationship with your\nphone during training\num Can perhaps help but also impede\nworkout motivation and performance in an\nearlier episode you mentioned that if\npeople are using their phone to play\nmusic during their workout that they\nestablish the complete playlist\nprior to initiating the workout and then\nnot deviate from that playlist as\nopposed to changing it in the middle\nbecause there's just too much of a uh of\nan Impulse to also check social media\ncheck email check text messages I mean\nthe way I think about the phone actually\nis it's a bunch of little brain areas\nit's got a memory system for you it's\ngot look up tables for lookup tables\nit's got websites to look things up on\nthe Internet it's got photos I mean it\nis so rich with sensory data and it's so\nclosely linked to our own brain\narchitecture the algorithms are designed\nfor those to be that way that I always\nthink about it as bringing in a second\nperson with me but that person is my\ntwin that um has severe attention issues\nand for those that already have\nattention issues just think about this\nas a twin that would then compound You\nby tapping on your shoulder talking to\nyou all the time interrupting you uh\nsomebody that you like a lot but that\nfrankly is um is a little bit irritating\nin that they're they're interrupting\nyour ability to really show up and also\nyour ability to show up for them so I\nstarted to think about the phone as um\nan entire individual and that it\nrepresents me and and certainly not the\nbetter version of me great exactly you\nactually mentioned something else that\nwill use uh occasionally which uh what\nwe call Brain Games or puzzles\nwhether this is a crossword puzzle or\nsomething where you actually lose\nyour thought of self for a second and\nyour brain gets engaged in a task that\nyou weren't regretting or even thinking\nabout these can be stupid little games\nuh it could be little challenges\nespecially if you're in like a group or\na team setting all right like we're\ngonna play one round of dodgeball or\nwe're gonna play one round of of Thumb\nWars so you do encourage this yeah I see\nso you would play like a thing instead\nof warming up like all right get in\neveryone get going we're gonna you know\nget your foam roller your diamond\nwhatever thing this is like all right\neveryone line up and we're gonna play\nThumb Wars to see who wins right just\nlike whatever right all of a sudden\nyou've snapped into a new mental shift\num or literally playing brain games\nplaying Tetris on your phone like any of\nthese things\num can work in this acute setting can I\nask you a question it's not directly\nrelated to recovery uh per se but I\nthink it's worth mentioning\num or asking about rather which is the\nuse of mirrors or no mirrors while\ntraining\num you know the experience of seeing\noneself and observing one's form in the\nmirror I suppose has some utility you\ncan get some sense of progress that you\nmight trigger\num you're almost specifically referring\nto resistance training I suppose it\ncould be cardio if you're running on a\ntreadmill or pushing a sled or something\nbut um you can see form\num you can get a sense of um what your\nface looks like when you Grimace uh but\nin all seriousness\num you are without question\na person not you Andy but\num one is in a less\ninteroceptive mode when looking at\nthemselves in the mirror so extra\nreception perception of things beyond\nthe confines of our skin even if it's a\npicture of us interception perception of\neverything from the skin inward\num and so if we're looking at ourselves\nwe're diverting some allocation of our\nattention let's say there's a hundred\nthese are arbitrary units and you can I\nthink put 50 of your attention on the\nfeeling in your body or the muscles\nyou're training and 50 on how it appears\nin the mirror or it could be 100 on the\nmirror 100 internally which you best\naccomplish probably by closing your eyes\nso obviously there are constraints here\ncertain movements you wouldn't want to\nclose your eyes Etc in general\nwhat are your thoughts on mirrors or no\nmirrors for resistance training\nspecifically it depends on the metric\nthat you find most important and what I\nmean by this is if you're training for\nsay muscle hypertrophy there's emerging\nevidence that suggests uh actually\nlooking at yourself in the mirror and\neven flexing in between sets can\nactually be advantageous or it can\naugment muscle gains oh my there's uh\nsupport for all the the uh mirror\nflexors absolutely not not making fun of\nyou I just uh it is sort of interesting\nto be on the observing side of that but\nHey listen results are what people are\nafter yeah having said that if you're\ntrying to enhance movement learning then\nit may be detrimental so if you're doing\nan exercise that is explosive and fast\nit's probably not the best thing to be\nlooking into a mirror if you were to\nwalk into any Olympic weightlifting\nArena and you had any thoughts of using\na mirror you would probably run out of\nthe gym very very quickly you can't see\nyourself in time to make an adjustment\nwith the movement that's happening that\nfast and also we'll do exactly what you\nmentioned which is it will remove your\nability\nto understand and feel the movement and\nso this is a big component to using\ntechnology for exercise at all is you\nhave to make sure that the end point\nis you understanding you and your\nphysiology more not less\nwhen you Outsource learning to\ntechnology in this case even if the\ntechnology is the mirror\nyou remove your ability to gain and\ntruly understand that learning process\nso you need to be very very careful\nwhether you're using a mirror or whether\nyou're using any number of apps where\nyou can record say a movement and then\nwatch it afterwards and it will give you\na breakdown if your hand was in the\nright spot or if it was in the right\nspot these are all great\nbut you need to then take the next step\nwhich is to say I need to be able to\nfeel that position\nall right so in the case of performance\nif you can imagine trying to learn a new\ntechnique say running technique and you\nhave to be able to watch yourself in the\nmirror to understand your stride in the\nright position if you don't take the\nnext step of saying okay now I don't\nhave to look in the mirror and I can\nfeel when I'm getting out of rhythm or\nwhatever the case is then you'll never\nbe able to actually then use that in\nyour race and so it's very very\nimportant that people again pay\nattention to what is the dependent\nvariable that you're actually interested\nin doing if you're trying to get better\nat something the tech is okay as a\nstarting place it just cannot be the\nfinishing place thank you for those\nReflections I'm curious as to what\nhappens or what one should do if their\nHRV is reduced for maybe three or four\nor more days in a row absolutely the\nnext question that I'm going to ask is\nin am I in that adaptation phase if so\nI'm gonna still ignore it just like I\ndid if it was a single bad day\nbut I'm gonna start watching it very\ncarefully I may actually now introduce\nsome other tests so I may use a\nperformance test uh we may look at\nsomething else maybe ask questions maybe\nhave some communication either with\nmyself or somebody else so I'm going to\nstart paying more attention but I'm\nstill really not going to take much\naction until that crosses more than\nseven days of consistent problems if it\ndoes do that or we're in a peaking phase\nthen I'm going to go to another set of\nsolutions that are truly going to pull\nme out of the hole rather than just be\nthose acute State shifters these are\nmore what I call chronic stage shifters\nnow some of these are actually very\nsimilar to the ones we've used before\nfor example\nthermal stress so\nI can promise you if your recovery score\nis in the tanks\nand you walk outside and you jump in\nyour 35 degree water and you get back\nout what's going to happen is your HRV\nscore immediately afterwards I'm talking\nwithin seconds is going to be\nsignificantly compromised\nright in other words think about that\nremember a low HRV means High\nsympathetic I promise you cold water\nwill put you in a high sympathetic Drive\nhowever and we've tested this pretty\nextensively looking at HRV zero\n15 30 60 90 all the way up to 180\nminutes post and on average you will see\nyour HRV score continue to rise after\nthat and so well you'll have this\nimmediate sympathetic response\nyou will immediately then respond you\nknow about 30 minutes on most people\ndepends on the person though and that\nscore will be improved for several hours\nafterwards so heat can kind of have a\nsimilar effect\nthat actually again isn't is sort of an\nacute fix but over time as we've\ndescribed earlier I can also have a\nlittle bit of a chronic effect\nwe can also then get into areas like\nsleep and so now we're going to start\nplaying and exploring why are you\nsleeping poor as well or was your sleep\nscore fine but your HRV was low that's a\nlittle bit of a different answer if your\nsleep is getting compromised then we're\ngoing to start going into and making\nsure we're improving our sleep in terms\nof like brain stuff\ninstead of maybe playing a game or\nhaving music or some of these other\ntricks those aren't going to really have\na chronic effect but you can do things\nlike work on social connection that's\nactually been shown to improve uh\nrecovery over time you can do things\nlike journaling or meditation and those\nhave an acute effect as well as a\nchronic effect so again if you go\nJournal right now you probably feel\nbetter but also we know that over time\nthat will gradually improve things so\num adaptogens and things like that also\ncan have a chronic effect so can things\nlike electrolytes or food or hydration\nif those things were were off so we're\ngoing to go to a whole number of areas\nbut those are the primary ones\noutstanding of all that of course it may\nbe simply a time to go back and reassess\nour training program and that's truly\nthe case so that's where we're at if so\nwe're probably going to either\ncompletely remove training\nor drop it to like 50 or so uh until we\nstart rebounding back to Baseline and\nthat's generally the numbers we use\nfor many people who are not training for\na competitive sport\nand maybe aren't pushing themselves\nreally hard you know maybe uh\nthey're they consider themselves\nsomebody who exercises in order to\nmaintain Health um and Aesthetics and\nLongevity Etc uh\nand they never really finish any workout\ncompletely exhausted\nthey're sleeping okay their appetite's\nokay\ncan we assume that they are recovering\nwell\num or maybe they're not creating enough\nof a\nadaptation response like there's no\nProgressive overreaching and so there's\nreally no stimulus for Recovery what I'm\nsaying here is on the on the face of it\nI think is obvious right if you don't\ntrain hard there's nothing to recover\nfrom\nwhat I'm really saying is\nis the ability to recover itself\nsomething that we need to train in other\nwords can we get better at recovering\nand the uh analogy here would be\nsomething like focus in order to perform\nwork of any kind but certainly mental\nwork\nand physical work we need to be able to\nfocus\nthe ability to focus is the reflection\nof a bunch of neural circuits and\nchemicals and hormones Etc but we know\nroughly what those are and we know that\nif you are poor at focusing for every\nsmall bit of time that you can focus a\nlittle bit longer even if it's a matter\nof seconds those circuits themselves get\nbetter at focusing\nand so on and so forth so in other words\nis the recovery system however broad\nneurotransmitter hormones neural\nmuscular immune based Etc can that\nsystem or set of systems\nbecome better can we get better at\nrecovering meaning can it become faster\nand uh more effective can we think of\nthe recovery system as kind of a blade\nthat gets sharper by engaging recovery\nbecause if so then there's strong reason\nfor people who are not pushing really\nhard to push at least a little bit\nharder than is comfortable for them\nevery once in a while to make sure that\nthat system doesn't start to slide back\nremember physiology is listening to\neverything you do and it is always\nresponding so the analogy that I will\nmeet your analogy with that I use here\nis the bowling alley so you've probably\nbeen bowling before and you've used the\nbumper Lanes right\nthe bumper Lanes I've gone bowling\nbefore and I've spent time in the gutter\nand I've spent time on the pins okay\num so it's been a while we used to have\na bowling alley in the town where I went\nto and um it was fun we used to slide\naround on those shoes and like it all\nthe kids would hang out there and I feel\nlike do they still have bowling alleys I\ndon't even know it feels like something\nthat may have gone the way of the the\nmid-2000s I don't care if no one bills\nanymore you're not going to ruin my good\nanalogy okay what my intent wasn't to\nruin your analogy um okay tell us about\nbowling all the bowlers are going to\ncome after me with with um bowling balls\nor something right you're gonna get\nblasted with all the stats on elevations\ncool so in if would one were to go\nbowling and they didn't want to put\ntheir ball in the gutter yeah you could\nput these little bumpers in those Lanes\nall right and these little foam pads\nthat go in the gutter that if your ball\nis going towards the gutter it hits\nthose and bounces off and goes back in\nthe lane right okay so in this entire\nconversation and this is actually true\nof a lot of the way people approach\ntheir fitness and health\npeople are very concerned oftentimes\nwith optimizing meaning I want to make\nsure I don't go in the gutter I don't\nwant to hit the walls so therefore I'm\ngoing to try to improve the accuracy\nin which I throw the ball so I want to\nmake sure that I'm throwing it down the\ncenter of the lane more often and I want\nto get my disc my standard deviation\nTighter and Tighter so that I don't get\nanywhere close to hitting the wall\nhowever what they're not realizing is\nif you do that the body will start\nshrinking the size of the lane because\nwhat it basically says is huh we haven't\nhad a ball touch Us in years we don't\nneed to be this wide let's get smaller\nand smaller and smaller so it's not that\nyou actually\nare having a reduced\nability to recover but you start\nbecoming incredibly sensitive to that\nso your two strategies for enhancing\nrecovery are to practice getting closer\nof throwing that ball down the middle\nlane or to widen\nto widen the alley and that's exactly\nwhat you're referring to and you\nabsolutely should do that and so what\nhappens is you don't have to be so\nprecise with what you're doing because\nyour ability to handle so many things is\nwidened so if you're off now by four or\nfive inches to the right no problem\nbecause you've just tripled the size of\nyour alley that's exactly what you want\nto do so paying attention to two things\nnumber one is getting better at accuracy\nmaybe staying really tight with your\nprogressions\nusing nutrition and sleep to optimize\nyour recovery and\npush your resilience is what we call\nthis in fact there's actually a\nbiological way to measure resilience we\ndo that in all of our folks this is\nscientifically validated stuff\nI didn't just make it up you can\nactually measure resilience and there's\nmore and more coming out on this but\nthat's exactly what that term meant so\nhow well can you handle and bang things\noff the stressful so when you see a\nreduction in say 10 of your HRV\ntoday for you that might make you feel\nterrible for me\nI might not feel anything because I'm\nwell adapted to large fluctuations and\ntherefore I'm okay the less and less you\ndo that the more and more responsive you\nwill be to those slight deviations so\nthat is exactly the target that's kind\nof what I allude to and I say you got to\nunderstand what are we optimizing for\nwe optimizing for making sure I don't\nfeel any different today are we\noptimizing to make sure when I do feel\ndifferent I still am able to perform so\nthis is why you want to do things like\nmaybe use some caffeine today\nand feel great but if I have to use it\nevery day all I'm doing is shrinking my\nsensitivity there so now if I have to go\na day without it\nI can't train at all right caffeine is\nthe easy example because people\nunderstand how that whole system works\nbut this is really true of everything\nelse so yeah you need to practice this\nand the way to do that is to give\nyourself more stress\nto continue to bring in the stress from\nnutrition from training from breath work\nyou mentioned earlier about Focus\nthe exact same thing right it's not just\nabout getting better right now it's\nabout training a system and you can\nclearly train that right\num we will often say breath work is a\npractice\nthat's exactly what we're talking about\nright so you're practicing getting\nbetter at these things you're practicing\nreturning your focus you're practicing\nrecovering and quite literally\nphysiologically you can up regulate\nwhether we're talking enzymes whether\nwe're talking about Regulators these\nwill be up regulated so then the next\ntime that insult comes in it's not as\nbig as it's not as damaging so yeah\nabsolutely you can and you should strive\nfor that\nthroughout all the episodes where we've\nbeen talking about exercise\nat the core of that is this word\nadaptations and I love that you\nmentioned that breath work\ncan also create adaptations the way I'm\nvisualizing all of this now is that\nresistance training with weights\nmachines body weight otherwise\ncardiovascular training running jogging\nsprinting jumping and so on\nthermal training exposure to heat\nexposure to cold in a dedicated way and\ndeliberate respiration AKA breathing or\nbreath work as a practice all of those\ncan be viewed as ways to trigger\nadaptations\nand in the context of recovery the\nspecific adaptations you're trying to\nengage are opposite to stress in fact\nwith the exception of\nperhaps\ndeliberate cold exposure\nmaybe you deliberate heat exposure\nbecause if the sauna is really hot you\ncan get the dinorphine release which is\nkind of uncomfortable\nbut still in both those cases the\nrebound from that in other words when\nyou get out you shower you go to bed the\nnext morning you do have this kind of\nblissed out feeling we know why that is\nthat is the rebound to that\nuncomfortable situation\nso it seems it doesn't really matter\nwhether or not you're using resistance\nyou're doing cardiovascular training\nusing thermal approaches or you're using\nrespiration based approaches\nall of these are really ways of both\ntriggering adaptations and if applied\nproperly to actually help you recover\nfrom the stress and create the\nthe literal result that you're that\nyou're trying to achieve for some people\nthat might have been obvious but I think\nfor many people including myself\nthis set of conversations that we've\nbeen having over the series\nthese episodes It's really the first\ntime that I've ever thought about\nexercise in these ways in any event it's\njust a reflection but it's one that at\nleast for me\num is tremendously useful because it has\na lot of um organizational logic to it\nuh which at least appeals to to my brain\nbecause the more that things have a\nlogic the more for me that they become\nsimplified and the more that the vast\narray of tools\nuh becomes uh becomes visible to me as\nyou said earlier what is it let me make\nsure I get this right it's um concepts\nare a few methods or many pretty close\nOkay how would you remind us how you\nstate it methods are many Concepts a few\nah okay either way the directionality\nprobably it doesn't matter no let's keep\nit right the the methods are many uh\nconcepts are few\num galpin's law i i in science you're\nnot allowed to name things after\nyourself\num but you can name uh things after\nother people so uh it's a galpin's law\nbecause I'm definitely the one who\ncreated that idea right absolutely that\nwas extreme and tremendous sarcasm to\nsword Ultra right regardless uh here we\ngo galpin's law there you go one thing\nthat's in my head right now is\nwe've thrown out a lot of options for\nfolks and maybe what we can do is try to\nsimplify a little bit so what I can kind\nof walk you through is how we\nmeasure recovery if you will and how\noften and some tools and what I would\nrecommend people do is not use\neverything I said\nyou want to pick one or two things per\ncategory that are most important to you\nthat are at your cost that are at your\navailability that are interesting and\nimportant relevant to you\nand do that the reason I kind of wanted\nto cover a a large number of things was\nto give them evokes options but again\nI want to emphasize the point is to not\nmeasure all of them in fact you don't\nneed to we um I've ran this before with\nprofessional athletes where we've taken\nblood urine every single day we've done\nperformance measures uh vertical jumps\non a force plate a whole bunch of things\nevery day for years on end and what I\ncan tell you is there's tremendous\nredundancy in physiology all right\nEverything is Everything so you don't\nneed to do them and don't feel like\nyou're missing out if you aren't doing\nthem one or two metrics is probably fine\nI generally recommend one subjective\nmeasure this could be as simple as\nwhat's your mood\nhow do you feel today\ngreat and one objective measure\nHRV\na resting heart rate anything else right\nso if you even literally just did that\nyou'd probably have pretty good insight\nas to what you're doing so\nmaybe in fact I'll go more detail here\num maybe I'll give you a couple of\nexamples of things to measure every day\nsome things that you should measure\nmaybe quarterly monthly and then maybe\neven some annually and then you can\nmaybe just pick a couple from each of\nthese categories and have yourself a\npretty good monitoring system for what\nto do and I'll include some that are a\nlittle bit of Technology based and then\nothers that are totally cost free and\nrequire nothing\nokay to start off I would recommend\ntaking something like HRV every day or\nor most days if you don't have a device\nlike that you could also use honestly\nthe CO2 tolerance test and we've talked\nabout that a number of times and we\nprobably have plenty of resources to go\nfind that but that doesn't require\nanything it typically takes about a\nminute or so and you can do that under\nthe same circumstances in which HRV in\nother words do at the same time every\nday have the same standardization stuff\nand that is actually been in our\ncoaching experience\num while admittedly there's no\npeer-reviewed research on this yet just\nin our experience this tends to track\nextremely closely with HRV and other\nmetrics of recovery\nin fact we actually did do a a pilot\ntrial in my lab and it attracted\ndecently well with both state and trade\nanxiety\nso it's a nice metric I'm not perfect\nbut you you could take that so if you\nwanted you could do both but again\nremember you're trying to capture\nsystemic stress and so you're really\njust showing you're measuring one thing\ntwo ways so you don't necessarily have\nto have them both I will do both just\nbecause\nI'm super interested in small\ndifferences but globally they're going\nto tell you basically the same thing so\nthose are two things where we use again\nbasically daily year round or or close\nto it if you want to go past that a\nlittle bit\num you can look at you can use an actual\na a pretty old commonly used survey\ncalled a dalda\nd-a-l-d-a I forget the exact acronym but\nit is a fairly lengthy questionnaire and\nit accounts for things like how do you\nfeel today how did you sleep\num any stressors going on in your life\nhow you've been eating and this is like\nfairly comprehensive lengthy survey that\ncame out I mean Jesus it's probably been\naround for 30 years or something is it's\nnothing new and been used extensively I\nyou would not want to do that every day\nif you wanted to take some subjective\nmeasures every day we typically stick\nwith like I said mood motivation\nsomething like that you would you could\nperform this to all the test though\nsomething more like monthly or at the\nend of each training phase you know\nevery couple of months and probably\nworth looking at it's not going to tell\nyou if you're in a bad spot today or\ntomorrow but you would pick that up with\nthe HRV or suit autonomous test it would\nthough tell you information especially\nif you're working with another\nindividual\nabout major life changes and if anything\nit just facilitates that conversation\nright I noticed you reported X happening\num let's let's talk about that and can I\nhelp et cetera\nso another kind of sneaky helpful one is\nis simply body fat like I said\num non-functional overreaching and over\ntraining are associated with the number\nof things like energy appetite\nsuppression changes and and body weight\nor body composition so you can measure\nthat monthly or even really quarterly uh\ndepending on what kind of athlete or\nindividual you're working at or if\nyou're trying to especially if you're\nnot trying to lose weight or if you're\ntrying to be at maintenance and that'll\ngive you some insights as well so moving\npast that now actually we're going to\nmove into the realm of things that we\ncall Hidden stressors so those are all\nvisible stressors\num so hidden stressors the most common\nones we've sort of mentioned and I would\nprobably do this\num well you're gonna have to do these\nones through serum so this is blood work\ncortisol like we talked about and\ntestosterone and then of course\ntestosterone a cortisone ratio and then\nthe other ones I mentioned you can do\nthose quarterly it's not bad there are\nsome blood markers that there's really\nno sense to do them that soon and there\nare other markers I mean in our system\nour individuals are getting pretty\nextensive blood work saliva work urine\nand stool and so there's plenty of those\nthings you just do not need to measure\nyou know every 10 weeks or so in this\ncase\nyou know cortisol as you know sort of\nchanges rapidly\ntestosterone can change pretty quickly\nbut if you're really trying to notice a\nlarge Trend you know certainly a\nquarterly or so is is an appropriate\ntime frame I'm doing it every four or\nfive weeks is probably unnecessary so\nyou can save yourself some money and do\nthat other stuff you can look at\nactually more like semi-annually in\nplasma like glutamine and glutamine to\nglutamate ratio and it can maybe save\nthe why you want to look at those for\nanother conversation but those are\nimportant\num we always look at something from the\noxidative stress\nthing so this could be something like\ntnf alpha or interleukin-6 something\nlike that again we're looking at that in\nserum and we're looking at that you know\nlike semi-annually and then another\nsneaky actually one um that I love to\nlook at is uh the neutrophil lymphocyte\nratio which will give you some pretty\ngood insight and again you could look at\nthat like fairly quarterly if that\nnumber starts to get really high\ncertainly like more than nine to one you\ngot a pretty good Insight that something\ngnarly is going on with your immune\nsystem so we will actually take action\nmuch lower than that number but that's\nlike a nice cutoff you'll see it's like\nthat's very very high number so those\nare some things you can use most folks\nhave the ability hopefully to get some\nbasic blood work done get a basic what's\ncalled a CBC and CMP\num if you have a great physician and you\ncan get insurance to cover that and you\njust go on and ask for a CBC and CMP\nthey'll know what that means you can\nGoogle that and they'll order it and\nyou'll get all the information typically\nthat I just described or close enough\nand you'll get some insights and then\nagain you can just use that free service\nI mentioned earlier to check to see\nwhether or not the changes are just a\nmatter of testing quality or actually\nphysiologically relevant what you just\ndescribed is an amazingly powerful array\nof tools\nI'm hoping that you can also mention a\nfew tools that are either lower cost\ntruly low cost or zero cost that while\nthey may not have the accuracy or give\nthe complete picture that some of the\nbiomarkers and other tools that you\nmentioned do that they can still provide\nreasonably reliable metrics that people\ncan use in order to assess their level\nof recovery absolutely the CO2 tolerance\ntest would be the first one and you can\njust take that metric anytime you'd like\nthe other ones we've talked about so far\nare things like your mood we haven't\nmentioned libido but that's another\nassessment that people also tend to have\na pretty good grip on and they know what\nfeels normal so when things go out of\nwhack it tends to be a pretty good\nsignal that people will recognize yeah\nand one note about that\num something that came up in an episode\non uh on hormones both for male and\nfemale Health that at some point it will\nAir which is that\nyou know there's no objective measure\nfor people in terms of libido across the\nboard meaning people vary tremendously\num age life circumstances\num uh and on and on and so um this is\none of those subjective measures that I\nthink people need to\nuh have some sense of what their\ncritical Baseline really is and I'm\nguessing that the time to assess that\nmight best be when initiating or Midway\nthrough a relatively low intensity\ntraining phase\num maybe during the time of year in\nwhich all the other factors\num that can influence libido are not\num at their maximum so if you think\nabout you know light and dopamine and\nthe relationship between those and the\ntestosterone estrogen systems we know\nthat libido uh testosterone estrogen men\nand women tends to peak in the summer\nmonths so if that's your Baseline that\nyou're comparing to I don't know that\nthat's as reliable as\num thinking something like the the fall\nor the spring yeah um and so anyway this\nagain is very subjective but would just\nencourage people to recognize that\nthere's no standard numbers for this no\nlookup table and there's no equivalent\nof the libido BMI the LMI um no\ndisrespect to the the acronym that\nprobably is LMI um so I think that\nit's just something to keep in mind as\npeople\num do comparisons or subjective\ncomparisons is\ndon't pick a comparison to an extreme\ntry and pick a comparison to a average\nas you know it to be that actually sort\nof reminded me one issue that we have\nseen a lot lately is people\nif they're having libido issues or just\neven slightly noticing a drop they just\nassume that then therefore means their\ntestosterone is crashing and those\nthings are certainly connected but that\nis not necessarily the case and where\nthat becomes a problem is then people\nthen go on things like trt Etc with no\ntrue oversight and then all kinds of\nother problems so make sure that if\nyou're going to take that step that you\nactually get testosterone measured and\nyou're working with a qualified person\nto guide you through that process don't\njust assume because you're having low\nenergy or your libido is a little bit\ndown it could be simply training related\nit could be sleep related could be any\nnumber of things\num so that's like a little bit of a word\nof caution there two quick points along\nthe lines of what you just said one\ninteresting thing that I learned when\nresearching our episode on testosterone\nand estrogen optimization this was an\nepisode that we've done some time ago\nbut is still available in our\nhubertlab.com all formats Etc\nis that many people actually increase\ntheir libido and even their levels of\ntestosterone and estrogen as they\nprogress from their 20s into their 40s\nif\nthey take excellent care of themselves\nincluding the correct exercise\nadaptations correct body fat to lean\nlean muscle uh ratios but of course they\ncan go the other way too A lot of people\ncan be training to achieve such low body\nfat stores that libido can suffer so it\nyou know the age depend age-related\ndeclines in libido are not necessarily\nwritten into the script of life in fact\nthere are some data points from a really\ninteresting paper I talk about in that\nepisode of uh individuals this was a\nstudy focused on males in their 80s and\n90s who maintained total and free\ntestosterone as high as\nindividuals in their 20s but then when\nyou look at the lifestyle factors of\nthose people in their 80s and 90s they\nwere doing a lot to create that that\nscenario the second point is one related\nto what you just said\num which is very true which is people\ngenerally tend to assume that a drop in\nlibido is related to a drop in\ntestosterone\num and then assume that they need to\nincrease their testosterone and in some\ncases that is true absolutely but it's\nalso often the case that people who take\nestrogen or aromatase blockers that is\nenzyme Inhibitors that prevent the\nconversion of testosterone to estrogen\nexperience severe deficits in libido\nbecause of estrogen totally low so\nestrogen blockers are as much an issue\nhere as um low testosterone then the\nfinal point is also one that many people\nnow men and women are um I think need to\nbe aware of which is that\ndihydrotestosterone DHT is among the\nmore powerful androgens for\npower output physical power output but\nalso for libido and DHT is strongly\ninhibited by certain things like\nturmeric so a lot of people who are\ntaking high doses of turmeric uh can\nexperience drops in libido so there and\nwho are taking\num various compounds to prevent hair\nloss things like finasteride so there's\na whole catalog of things that can\nreduce libido that are not directly in\nthe testosterone pathway it can be DHC\nrelated estrogen related and this I\nthink points to the importance of yes\ntake a subjective measure of your libido\npay attention essentially be aware don't\nyou know don't obsess but be but be\naware and try and figure out what\nfactors\num are involved for you but don't\nimmediately assume that it what's needed\nis more testosterone and oftentimes um\nthe opposite is the case yeah yeah try\nto put on a lot of muscle with no\nestrogen\ngood luck right and indeed a lot of um\nathletes in particular uh you know\ncompetitive bodybuilders that have that\nyou know Saran Wrap thin skin if you get\nto know some of those people when you\ntalk to them they they can look like the\nsort of comic book archetype of what\num someone might might want to be I mean\nthat's not what this discussion or these\nepisodes have been about but oftentimes\nthey can have um serious libido issues I\nmentioned earlier and I will emphasize\nit once more you need to be very\ncautious when you're taking antioxidants\nanti-inflammatories cortisol reducers\nfor all those reasons right I didn't\nreally sort of get in examples but you\njust nailed another fantastic reason of\nit we do not give those things\nprophylactically I I strongly discourage\npeople from just walking around taking\nsupplementation of antioxidants\nespecially powerful ones for no reason\nif you have done some testing and you\nhave a good reason to do so I'm fine or\nif you're in a very specific take\ntraining phase or something like that\ncool but if you're just walking around\ndoing that you are oftentimes not always\nbut you're oftentimes causing problems\nthat then you then try to solve by\ntaking more of those\nanti-inflammatories I feel terrible low\nenergy a little libido blah blah blah\nblah I'm too inflamed\nEtc so yeah antioxidants in the form of\nfood\nare fantastic\nalmost no issue there is a good evidence\nactually there\nso don't worry about man I shouldn't eat\nHigh antioxidant rich foods you're going\nto be fine what we're talking about here\nis Pharmaceuticals and supplementation\nwhere you can take orders of magnitude\nhigher dosages very quickly than you\ncould in the presence of food so that\ndistinction is also very important\nantioxidant rich foods are generally\nfine and thus consumed in totally absurd\nconcentrations supplementations powders\ncreams drugs Etc is where you can get\ninto problems so yeah you want to be\nvery careful of doing that unless you\nhave a reason we don't do that unless uh\nwe see a reason to do so in someone's\nmarkers yeah and herbal compounds\ndespite the fact that their herbal can\nbe quite potent modulators of of\nhormones um ashwagandha being an example\ntwo herbal compounds that we've talked a\nlot about on our podcast before and and\nrepeatedly including in that\ntestosterone estrogen and optimization\nepisode uh Tonga Ali and fedogi agrestis\nTonga Ali is now taken by a large number\nof men and women\num\nTonga Ali and fedoja typically men I'm\nnot sure that there are any good studies\nabout the effects of fedocia in women\nthose are herbal compounds that can have\npotent effects in increasing\ntestosterone and luteinizing hormone do\nthey work yeah they work to varying\ndegrees in in most everybody not\ncertainly not in everybody\num but they do work but they they work\nbecause they're potent they have effects\nso the idea that herbal compounds are\nnot powerful\num is wrong and it's important to\nremember that that can cut both ways\nhence my mention of this uh observation\nrelated to turmeric which is not to say\nthat some people can't take turmeric and\nfeel perfectly fine maintain or even\nincrease their libido that I sure that\ncan happen it's just that for people\nthat are very DHT sensitive\nthis tends to be an issue so\nunfortunately for many of these\ncompounds the only way to find out is\nreally to try them or to just completely\navoid them and decide you don't want to\ntry them as fine too but there really\naren't ways to predict who will respond\nwho won't and who will be hyper\nresponders and\num in that case it's a bit of a it's a\nlittle bit of a wild west I'm also sort\nof remembering what the point of this\nconversation was supposed to be and\nmaybe I'll return back to that which\nwere some cost free or low cost metrics\nthat was a very fun tangent but\nnonetheless uh another couple of ones\nyou can do are uh grip strength testing\nso if you can buy a you know fairly\ncheap hand grip dynamometer on any\nnumber of places these are typically\nable to be purchased for 20 to 40 or\nsomething like that right\num You can actually just test that every\nday I've done that uh in a number of\nathletes for a decent amount of time uh\nadmittedly I don't do it anymore\nand that's not because I disagree with\nit but because we just we're getting the\ninformation\nalready and it was just too redundant\nbut if that's the only option it is a\ngreat one to do I mentioned Also earlier\nhow I actually like speed tests over\nstrength tests as an earlier indication\nof overreaching and so because of that I\nlike a vertical jump test if you have\naccess to a force plate that's great and\nthen you can get more in-depth\ncharacteristics of the force velocity\ncurve and acceleration and things like\nthat used a lot in high performance\nsituations if not simply looking at you\nknow your performance and so you can\nkind of go back to one of our earlier\nepisodes when I described coloring my\nfingertips with highlighters earlier in\nmy life you could do the same thing and\ngo out in your garage and every day jump\nup and touch that marker and see where\nyou're at\num so a system like that could be done\nyou can also use tools like uh Force\ntransducer and do a standard movement I\ncan say a vertical jump or a high pull\nor something like that and measure the\nvelocity and just compare that\nday-to-day of a standard load right so\nyou do it every single time with the\nsame load\num same similar thing could be done with\nlike a medicine ball throw so you have\nthe same ball you throw the same thing\nand just sort of where you're at today\nyou want to do a little bit of warm-up\nbut not excessive here you want to kind\nof get an idea of where your Baseline is\nand you don't want to influence it by\nthe veracity of the warm-up every single\nday because that alone again changes\nsame thing with stretching acute static\nstretching\ndirectly influences power production so\nyou don't want to go out there and one\nday do a 20 minute stretch before then\nthe other day you didn't stretch at all\nbecause that alone will will cause\ndeviations in your performance so try to\nkeep everything you can think of\nstandardized\nand that'll give you a little bit better\ndata remembering all of these values\nthe biomarkers the performance stuff\nthey have normal variations\nyou just want to figure out first and\nforemost what those normal variations\nare for you so you have your normal\nnumber\nyou have your standard deviation\nwhen you start getting outside of that\nstandard deviation you start paying\nattention and so that's kind of like\nwhat we typically call that the gray\nZone and so if it is in the gray Zone\nwe're fine we're not adjusting but if\nit's outside of that whatever that is\nfor you recognizing that the grave zone\nis smaller for some folks and larger for\nothers but what is normal for you and\nyour situation and then you can make\nyour decisions outside of that when you\nsee numbers that are consistently or\nmore than three to five days\nin a row or close for the last five days\nfor the last six something like that\nthen you maybe have some cause for\naction well that was an incredible\ndescription of the various tools and\nmodes for recovery and I realized I\njumped the gun a bit during our\ndiscussion about food and supplements\nbut I like to think that it serves as a\nnice precursor to the next episode which\nis going to be all about nutrition and\nsupplementation\nif you're learning from and or enjoying\nthis podcast please
