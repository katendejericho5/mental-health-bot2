    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the huberman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm our\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOphthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine today's episode is the third in\nthe sixth episode series on fitness\nexercise and performance today's episode\nis all about endurance and fat loss that\nis the specific protocols required to\nachieve the four different kinds of\nendurance and how to maximize fat loss\nDr Andy Galpin great to be back\ntoday we're going to talk about\nendurance and I'm very interested in\nthis conversation because I like many\nother people strive to get a certain\namount of cardiovascular work in each\nweek\nmaybe a long-ish jog maybe a swim ride\nthe bike Etc\nbut when I think about the word\nendurance the idea that almost\nimmediately comes to mind is about doing\nsomething for a long period of time\nrepeatedly but I have a feeling that\nthere are other ways to trigger this\nadaptation that we call the endurance\nadaptation so I'm excited to learn about\nthat I'm also excited to learn about the\nfuel systems\nin the body that allow for endurance and\nother modes of repeated activity so in\norder to kick things off I'd love for\nyou to frame the conversation by telling\nus\nwhat is endurance and are there indeed a\nlarge variety of ways to induce what we\ncall this endurance adaptation sure the\nway I want to start actually here is is\ncalling back to some of the things we\ntalked about our previous conversations\nwhich are really people exercise for\nthree reasons number one you want to\nfeel better\nnumber two you want to look a certain\nway and then number three you want to be\nable to do that for a long time right so\nyou need the way that we say it in\nsports is look good feel good play good\nright so I want some sort of\nfunctionality to be able to perform a\ncertain way whatever that is for you you\nwant to be able to look a certain way\nthat whatever that matters for you and\nthen you want to be able to do that for\na long time so when it comes to\nendurance we have a bunch of misnomers\nhere which is the same thing with the\nstrength training and resistance\nexercise side where we wanted to dispel\nthis myth that\nI lift weights only because I I want to\ngain muscle or play a sport and I want\nto do cardio because I want to leave\ntheir loose fat or for long Health sake\nand just like we smashed that myth from\nthe strength training side I want to\nsmash it from the endurance training\nside there are so many other reasons\nthat you want to perform endurance\ntraining\nregardless of your goal right whether it\nis longevity whether it is performance\nor whether it is Aesthetics and so we're\ngonna I want to cover all those reasons\nuh exactly what to do Protocols of\ncourse and why those things are working\nthat way in general though the quick\nanswer\nis really endurance comes down to two\nindependent factors Factor number one is\nfatigue management and then Factor\nnumber two is fueling and that's all it\nreally comes down to so all the\ndifferent types of training are going to\nreach a limitation which are either\nagain your ability to deal with some\nsort of fatigue and that's generally a\nfatigue signal the other one is\nmanaging some sort of restriction of\nenergy input and a lot of the spoiler\nhere is a lot of the times people think\nit's a fueling issue and really it's a\nfatigue management issue or the opposite\nand to have a complete Health Spectrum\nregardless of whether you're a high\nperformance athlete like I typically\ndeal with or general public you need to\nbe able to do both manage fatigue as\nwell as understand fuel storage so\nthat's really what we're going to get\ninto today fantastic I can't wait before\nwe dive in I'm going to ask you what I\noften ask people who are expert in their\nrespective fields which is is there any\nnon-obvious tool or mechanism or tool\nend mechanism that can allow people to\naccess better endurance you know when I\nthink about training for endurance again\nI think about trying to run longer and\nlonger each week yeah or Swim further\nand further and so on but I do wonder\nwhether or not there are other forms of\ntraining that can amplify the endurance\nadaptation\nthat I or most people perhaps don't\nthink of as endurance sure the way I\nwant to answer this is if we look back\nand think about how we've answered that\nquestion with power and strength in\nforce production it is really about how\nmuch can you produce\nmaximally once\nwhat you're asking now is how can I\nrepeat that same quality of performance\nif that's the case endurance really\ncomes down to your ability to maintain\nproper mechanics\nthat's going like the biggest way we can\nand increase your endurance\nexponentially very quickly is mechanical\nand this is starting with breathing and\nso we need to be breathing properly we\nneed to have proper posture and\npositions and then we need to be moving\nwell efficiency is going to Trump Force\nalways\nfor endurance\nthe other side of the equation is not\nthat you can have a little bit of leaks\nin your mechanics and still squat well\nor jump high and be fine because you\ndon't have to suffer those consequences\nrepeatedly right that's going to drain\nyou over time so the quickest way to\nimprove endurance is to improve\nmechanics and the mechanical thing I\nwould go after first is your breathing\ntechniques your pattern your entire\napproach as well as your posture and\nthen from there the third one would be\nyour movement technique is it possible\nto describe the best way to breathe when\ndoing an endurance training or is it far\nmore complex than that and if it is far\nmore complex than that then certainly we\ncan get into it during today's episode\nyeah it is both of those I will give you\na quick answer though a lot of the times\nyou can\nkind of Hit the cheat code which is\nnasal breathing there's plenty of times\nwhen you don't want to nasal breathe you\ndon't need your nasal breathe but just\nagain is that like a one tool that is a\nfor a pretty General answer if you can\ndo that a lot of the times that will fix\nbreathing mechanics just by default and\nwe can maybe talk about why that is\nlater but that would be my sort of one\nsentence bullet point answer immediately\nof how to get in the right positions the\nsecond one would be simply looking at\nyour posture right so whether you're on\na bike or you're doing a lift or you're\nrunning if you're literally uh hunched\nover and your ribs are touching your\nfemur or getting closer and closer like\ntends to happen on a bike or an air\nassault thing for somebody I've seen\nrecently this morning I was on the\nassault bike um doing a Sprint and I\nasked Andy Dr Galpin to critique my form\nand anything else he wanted to critique\nso that I could improve and he did\ncomment on my rather c-shaped posture\ncorrect um encouraging me to be more\nupright which I should probably do now\nas well and he also cued me to the fact\nthat during a one minute Sprint there is\nsomething that is quote unquote magic\nthat happens right about the 42nd Mark\nand I use that as a\num as a milestone uh to look for and\nindeed something does happen at the 42nd\nit's into a one minute Sprint where all\nof a sudden it it does seem to get much\neasier for reasons I don't understand\nmaybe you can to tell it that but it\ncertainly had nothing to do with my\nposture my posture needs Improvement\nthank you well yeah so\num breathing mechanics and breathing\nstrategies uh people tend to be over\nbreathing early on and this is going to\nlead to problems later so having a more\nstrategic breathing pattern and approach\nis again a very quick solution I know\nthat we're going to dive very deep into\nthe mechanisms of Energy and Metabolism\nand endurance today but as long as we're\nhaving a discussion about these um\nbriefs or tidbits of how to improve\nendurance are there any other ways to\nimprove endurance that that are of\nrelatively short time investment even if\nthey require a lot of um energy\nsure the classic Paradigm you're going\nto find here is steady state long\nduration\nposed up against what a lot of folks\nwill now call higher intensity interval\ntraining specifically and there's a lot\nof misconceptions here the quick answer\nis you need to be doing both and there's\nprobably a bunch of stuff in between\nthat you should be practicing if you\nhonestly want to maximize those three\nfactories we talked about at the\nbeginning you need to be training across\nthis full spectrum just like I told you\nto train across the full spectrum of\nyour lifting we want to be doing the\nsame thing here so are there independent\nspecial factors that can happen with the\nshorter time length higher intensity\nstuff absolutely there's also magic that\nhappens on the other end of that\nSpectrum so it's very important that\npeople don't just choose one side\nbecause what tends to happen is people\neither go with the oh I'm going to do 30\nor 45 minutes of steady state stuff\nthat's it or I'm gonna do the opposite\nwhich I'm going to leave that stuff on\nthe table not do it because I only want\nto do high intensity intervals because I\ncan get it done in five minutes so\nthere's Magic on both sides of the\nequation we want to get into all that\nbut just to answer your question\ndirectly\nthere's a whole bunch of of things you\ncan do\num in under one minute that are\nconvenient to do and there's a wonderful\nset of papers out of a couple\nLaboratories in Canada that that\nchampioned this idea that's called\nexercise snacks so there's a bunch of\nthere's a series of studies that have\nbeen done here that are really\ninteresting and they've looked at a\ncouple of things that are noteworthy one\nof them is a 20-second bout of all out\nwork and this is actually done in\nworkers in an office and so what they\nhave them do is run upstairs and I\nbelieve it was about 60 steps is what it\ntook them something along the order of\n20 seconds exactly and they repeated\nthat about once every four hours\nso really it's you go to work you get\nyou know put your coffee and your bag\ndown whatever you run up a flight of\nstairs 20 seconds later then you go\nright back to work at lunch and before\nyou go home you sort of repeat it there\nand if you repeat that that's multiple\ntimes a week you're going to do that I\nthink they in one of the interventions\nit was three times a week\nfor six weeks 18 total times you did\nthat\nand what you'll see is a noticeable\nImprovement this is statistically\nsignificant improvements in\ncardiorespiratory Fitness specifically\nVO2 max as well as a number of cognitive\nbenefits work productivity\nEtc that can happen in as little as 20\nseconds you don't have to go to the gym\nyou don't have to shower you don't have\nto do anything like that just find the\nstairs run up and down them a few times\nnow you may have noticed um you actually\nsort of caught me yesterday I did that\nright here right I was just I we had a\nlittle bit of a break I was feeling an\nenergy lull I ran up the stairs three or\nfour times felt a lot better so that can\nactually also help they ran another\nstudy where they looked at that\nfollowing a giant high glycemic index\nmeal and what they saw and then they\ntook insulin measures and a whole bunch\nof\num other biological markers Associated\nthat you want to pay attention to the\nhigh glycemic index meal and they looked\nat those immediately an hour three hours\nsix hours as opposed and it was very\nclear that same intervention was able to\nimprove post-planned yell glucose\ncontrol insulin and a whole bunch of\nother factors in addition to that so if\nyou are the sort of type who's like wow\nI'm in an office all day maybe also had\na giant high glycemic index meal not the\nbest approach but a little bit of\nmitigation there can just be running up\na flight of stairs or doing something\nlike that for as little as 20 seconds so\nthere's a lot of magic and power and\nmaximal exertion\nif one does not have access to a flight\nof stairs at work could they do jumping\njacks absolutely I mean you could do\nanything you really wanted it's not the\nmode of exercise that matters here it is\nsimply the exertion you just get up as\nhard as you can you could do burpees you\ncould do any number of things you could\nSprint down your road down the hallway\nback and forth the mode is is just uh\nsomething that was easy for the\nscientists to control and X number of\nsteps people could do it you're not\ngoing to fall hurt yourself things like\nthat just to remind me it's once every\nfour hours one minute of all 20 seconds\noh 20 seconds excuse me uh 20 seconds of\nessentially all out exertion yep while\nremaining safe not going so fast up the\nstairs or doing jumping jacks certainly\nnot down the stairs\nup the stairs please\num escalators don't count well I suppose\nthey count if they're uh you know if\nyou're if you're moving uh if you're not\nremaining on the same steps\num in fact in an airport recently I saw\nsomebody walking against the oh there\nyou go the conveyor yeah while talking\non the phone while waiting for their\nflight to take off and I thought it's\ngenius right it looked a little awkward\nwho cares yeah but it was I have looked\nawkward in every airport I've been in\nfor the last 15 years for those exact\nreasons doing wild stuff like that yeah\nwell nothing's more Awkward than not\nbeing able to walk to the end of the\nterminal simply because one isn't\nfamiliar with walking that far carrying\na couple of suitcases there you go yeah\nthat's the the other fit test the\nsuitcase carrier yeah I'm in the airport\nI love this so once every four hours 20\nseconds so maybe once when arriving to\nwork once four hours in and then four\nhours most people probably work\nsomewhere you know eight plus or minus\ntwo hours now one thing I actually\nreally want to make clear because your\naudience is so incredible\num\nthey tend to be really excited about\nthese protocols and they follow them\nexactly as written that's not exactly\nhow science works so it doesn't\nnecessarily have to be every four hours\nit's in half three three times a day it\ndoesn't have to be 20 seconds they\nliterally built that protocol because it\nwas so they're trying to replicate a\nreal life scenario maybe you're in an\noffice building you're generally there\nfor eight hours Let's see if you did one\nevery sort of so if you want to do it\nfour times a week great if you can do it\nonly 10 seconds amazing you're probably\ngoing to get the same benefits those are\nnot the details to pay attention to the\ndetail to pay attention to is every so\noften multiple times a day\ntry to get your heart rate up really\nquickly it doesn't require sweating\ndoesn't require anything else there's no\nwarm-up associated with it again you\nneed a minute break in between meetings\nor whatever and you can Sprint up them I\ndo this all the time in my house when\nyou you know have those days when you're\non like seven straight hours of zooms\nEtc you can get out of 20 seconds I run\nto my garage which is over there I hop\non the the airbike and I will just smash\nout 30 seconds as fast as I can and then\nwalk right back in\nlove it yeah\nI'm gonna start yeah just also you can\njust put one of those things which I do\nalso just put one in your office\nand hop over right over there you know\nthe whole entire thing now literally\ntakes 23 seconds before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is also separate\nfrom Dr Andy galpin's teaching and\nresearch roles at Cal State Fullerton it\nis however part of our desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme we'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is momentous momentous\nmakes supplements of the absolute\nhighest quality the huberman Lab podcast\nis proud to be partnering with momentous\nfor several important reasons first of\nall as I mentioned their supplements are\nof extremely high quality second of all\ntheir supplements are generally in\nsingle ingredient formulations if you're\ngoing to develop a supplementation\nprotocol you're going to want to focus\nmainly on using single ingredient\nformulations with single ingredient\nformulations you can devise the most\nlogical and effective and cost-effective\nsupplementation regimen for your goals\nin addition momentous supplement ship\ninternationally and this is of course\nimportant because we realize that many\nof the huberman Lab podcast listeners\nreside outside the United States if\nyou'd like to try the various\nsupplements mentioned on the huberman\nLab podcast in particular supplements\nfor Hormone Health for Sleep\noptimization for Focus as well as a\nnumber of other things including\nexercise recovery you can go to live\nmomentous spelled ous so that's\nlivemomentis.com huberman today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by levels\nlevels is a program that lets you see\nhow different foods and activities\naffect your health by giving you\nreal-time feedback on your blood glucose\nusing a continuous glucose monitor many\npeople are aware that their blood sugar\nthat is their blood glucose level is\ncritical for everything from Fat Loss to\nmuscle gain to healthy cognition and\nindeed aging of the brain and body most\npeople do not know however how different\nfoods and different activities including\nexercise or different temperature\nenvironments impact their blood glucose\nlevels and yet blood glucose is\nexquisitely sensitive to all of those\nthings I first started using levels\nabout a year ago as a way to understand\nand how different foods exercise and\ntiming of food relative to exercise and\nquality of sleep at night impact my\nblood glucose levels and I've learned a\ntremendous amount from using levels it's\ntaught me when best to eat what best to\neat when best to exercise how best to\nexercise and how to modulate my entire\nschedule from work to exercise and even\nmy sleep so if you're interested in\nlearning more about levels and trying a\ncontinuous glucose monitor yourself go\nto levels.link huberman that's levels\ndot link slash huberman today's episode\nis also brought To Us by element element\nis an electrolyte drink that contains\nthe exact ratios of the electrolyte\nsodium magnesium and potassium to\noptimize cellular functioning for mental\nand physical performance most people\nrealize that hydration is key we need to\ningest enough fluids in order to feel\nour best and perform our best but what\nmost people do not realize is that the\nproper functioning of our cells and\nnerve cells neurons in particular\nrequires that sodium magnesium and\npotassium be present in the correct\nratio goes now of course people with\npre-hypertension and hypertension need\nto be careful about their sodium intake\nbut what a lot of people don't realize\nis that if you drink caffeine if you\nexercise and in particular if you're\nfollowing a very clean diet that is not\na lot of processed foods which of course\nis a good thing chances are you're not\ngetting enough sodium potassium and\nmagnesium to optimize mental and\nphysical performance element contains a\nscience-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams\nthat's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams\nof potassium and 60 milligrams of\nmagnesium and no sugar if you'd like to\ntry element you can go to drink element\nthat's lmnt.com huberman to get a free\nelement sample pack with your purchase\nagain that's drink element lmnt.com\nhuberman to claim a free sample pack so\ntell me about endurance what is\nendurance how do I get more endurance\nand how does it work\nwhen we think about endurance I would\nlike to open up the conversation to\ninclude more things than people\ngenerally do when they hear the word\nendurance so if we just think about what\nyou typically ask your body to do or\nwould like to ask your body to do and we\njust walk through them\nit's going to be things like this number\none I want to have energy throughout the\nday that's actually a form of endurance\ngreat I don't want to have these lulls\nand fatigue and I want to feel fantastic\nas I move throughout my activities of\ndaily living whatever those may be work\nexercise\nenjoyment paying attention focus all\nthat stuff great that's one thing\nanother thing you want to ask your body\nto do is I want to be able to repeat\nsome small effort in a muscle group and\nnot and feel great about that this is\nwhat we generally call muscular\nendurance so this is something like I\nwant to be able to walk up those 10\nflights of steps and my quads aren't\nburning at the end of it right or it\neven gives me energy another thing\nyou'll want to ask your body to do is to\nbe able to perform a tremendous amount\nof work\nfor a longer period of time something in\nthe realm of you know 20 to 80 seconds\nso this could be something like if\nyou're surfing and you've got to paddle\nextremely hard for a minute to get on on\ntop of a wave or you want to you got\nyou're out riding your bike and you need\nto be able to get up a hill and it's a\nvery Steep Hill these are going to take\nmaximal efforts for some small amount of\ntime and then you'll get back up there\nwe tend to call that maximum anaerobic\ncapacity so that the max amount of work\nyou can perform at a higher rate for\nsome amount of seconds to like maybe a\nminute\npast that is your ability to repeat an\neffort kind of like that for something\nlike 5 to 15 minutes and this example\nwould be run a mile right some some\ninterval like that which is a longer\ndistance right that is going to be your\nmaximum aerobic capacity\nokay\nanother thing you're going to want your\nbody to do is we call sustained position\nso this is you want to be able to sit in\nyour chair at work and have perfect\nposture for 20 30 40 minutes right you\nwant to be able to stand in line at a\ngrocery store for 15 minutes and not\nhave a breakdown in posture so you want\nto be able to maintain position when\nyou're riding your bike you're not\ncollapsing you're doing any of these\nactivities and you don't get hurt\nor lose efficiency simply because you\ncouldn't sustain basic positions all\nright whatever those shapes and\npositions need to be\nokay and then the last one is a maximum\ndistance so you won't be able to go for\na longer hike or have just a long day at\nDisneyland for whatever it needs to be\nand feel great at the end of it right so\nthe goal with all of these things is not\ncan you just do them but can you do them\nand then you feel good afterwards so\nwe're back in a right position where\nthey give you energy you feel good about\nit and it's not just something you had\nto do and you regretted and you felt\nawful so those are the factors I think\nabout when someone says I want better\nendurance is I want to walk backwards\nand say okay when you say endurance what\ndo you mean and that's generally the\nthings I've come across as if you can\nhandle all of those things you're going\nto feel like you're in fantastic shape\nyou're going to feel your recovery is\ngoing to be excellent and your physical\nperformance in the gym or in any of the\nsporting activities you do will be\nenhanced given what you told us a little\nbit earlier that endurance really\nreflects fatigue and management and\nenergy production\nhow do each and both of those things\nrelate to endurance at a mechanistic\nlevel so really what I'm asking is what\nis fatigue management and what is energy\nproduction in order to do that it's\nimportant that we understand all of\nthose functional capacities that I just\ntalked about\nthey all have different points of\nfailure\nokay so in order to then work backwards\nand say well how do I optimize my\nperformance in all those categories we\nneed to go through each one and figure\nout where am I failing some of them are\ngoing to be failing because of fatigue\nmanagement and some of them will be\nfailing because of energy production\nissues so if we walk through a little\nbit of how we make energy and how we\nhandle fatigue then we're going to have\na better understanding of exactly what\nto do for each one of these categories\nif you feel like one of them in\nparticular is worse for you or lagging\nbehind or if in general you just want to\nimprove all of them all right now I want\nto make a little bit of a 90 degree turn\nhere\nI'm going to do it with strategy though\nI promise and I want to ask you a very\nsimple question\nhow do you lose weight\nI was taught that the calories in\ncalories out\nthermodynamics of energy utilization\ngoverns most everything that is if I'm\ningesting\nless caloric energy than I burn\nthen I'm going to lose weight and if I'm\ningesting exactly as much as I burn I'll\nmaintain weight and if I ingest more\nthen I burn\nthen I'll gain weight sure that is the\napproach you would take\nwhat I'm asking really is how are you\nactually physically losing the weight\nso my understanding is that we have\ndifferent fuel sources in the body\nglycogen\nwhich is stored in muscle and liver body\nfat which is sort of mainly white\nadipose tissue and which is subcutaneous\nand around our organs intra visceral fat\nand that we can also use protein as a\nfuel and then as I recall there's also a\nphosphocreatine system and I think\nyou're going to tell me that each of\nthese systems is tapped into on\ndifferent time scales and perhaps\naccording to different levels of\nexertion and I'm certain that what I\njust said is not exhaustive but\nhopefully it is most or entirely correct\npretty correct what's that got to do\nwith fat loss\nat some point body fat stores adipose\nadipocytes fat cells are going to start\nliberating fat as a fuel source\nand the stimulus for that I'm assuming\nis going to be that other fuel sources\nare either depleted or that the energy\nand metabolic systems of the body\nI don't want to say decide because they\ndon't have their own Consciousness but\nare um our flip signals are signaling in\na way that registers that body fat would\nbe the optimal fuel source given how\nlong\nor into and or intensely a given\nactivity has been performed okay we have\nsome stuff to clean up there but we're\nstill not really answering the question\nhow am I actually losing that body fat\nuh how is it actually leaving the body\ncorrect uh my understanding is that it\nleaves the body through respiration aha\nso now we have some interesting things\nto talk about\nhow am I actually losing fat via\nrespiration what the hell does that even\nmean how is something that occupied this\nphysical space on the side of me leaving\nmy body through my mouth\nand that is a very clear answer there\nright which I'm sure you're queued up to\nwhen you take a breath in you're\ngenerally breathing in oxygen O2 that's\nsome other things but we'll just stick\nto oxygen when you exhale you're\nbreathing out CO2 the difference between\nthose two is that carbon molecule well\none of the things that's important to\nunderstand here is all of your\ncarbohydrates which is that word itself\nis a carbon that has been hydrated so it\nis a carbon molecule attached to a water\nmolecule it is a simple chain of carbons\nyour fat molecules are also chains of\ncarbon all of metabolism really in terms\nof energy production is simply trying to\nfigure out a way to break those carbon\nbonds as a result we get energy from\nthat we use that energy to create a\nmolecule called ATP which is the central\nsource of energy for any living being\nright that carbon is then floating\naround in free form which is bad news\ninternally so we've got to figure out a\nway to get that carbon out of our system\nso all of energy production all of\nfatigue management really comes down to\nthis core issue of how are we handling\ncarbon and how are we moving it around\nthe body and so what we do is we do this\nsneaky thing so another question I'd\nlike to ask people is why do we breathe\nwell\nfor two reasons uh to bring oxygen into\nthe system and to offload carbon dioxide\nbut the neural trigger for breathing is\nwhen carbon dioxide hits a threshold\nlevel and the set of neurons in the\nbrain stem and elsewhere uh activate the\nphrenic nerve or the gas reflex or a\ncombination of things and we inhale or\ninhale right so a reduction of oxygen\nintake generally doesn't stimulate\nventilation unless you're at altitude\nthen that sort of changes right in\ngeneral it's an elevation in CO2 that's\ngoing to stimulate breathing off the\nonly reason you bring in O2 for the most\npart is to get rid of the CO2 oxygen is\nnot a fuel source\nit is not a way and it works the same\nwith fire by the way so you know you\nhave to have oxygen present for a fire\nto go and if you use quelch oxygen the\nfire will go out right that's about half\nof\num how those like fire extinguishers\nwork but we think then that means oxygen\nis the fuel it is not the fuel it is\nsomething entirely different it is a\nnecessary Pro it is a product that is\nnecessary for the metabolism process to\nactually occur all right so we're kind\nof dancing around an idea here which is\nthis carbon cycle of life\nso what happens in plants is they\ngenerally will breathe in the opposite\nand breathe out the opposite of humans\nso a plant will breathe in CO2 and\nexhale O2 all right this is why we have\nto have a certain amount of these things\nand algae and forests and trees and\nstuff to maintain this O2 CO2 balance in\nour atmosphere we do the opposite so we\nhave this wonderful circle of life we\nbreathe in O2 breathe out CO2 they do\nthe opposite well what happens is\nbecause carbohydrates are long chains of\ncarbon and fats are as well generally\nwhen we think about fats by the way it's\nimportant to understand that structure a\nlittle bit so if we think about\ntriglycerides it is a three carbon\nbackbone chain of glycerol so one two\nthree and horizontally running off of\neach one of those are fatty acid chains\nright so we form this structure that\nlooks like an e right like the letter e\nthree in the back and then three chains\ncoming off of it each of those chains\nare called fatty acids and each of those\nfatty acids are a length of carbon right\nor a number of carbons strung together\nhowever many carbons are there\ndetermines which type of fatty acid it\nis right so stearic acid linoleic acid\nlike any different number of things it's\nalso what determines whether or not it\nis a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated\nas if carbon requires a special thing\ncalled a double bond so if there's a\ndouble bond across every carbon and\ncarbon then they're all fully saturated\nand you're great if there's any of them\nthat are not double bonded and in fact\nan example if there is one that doesn't\nhave a double bond that is now called\nMono and saturated if there are many it\nis called polyunsaturated\nso there's pros and cons to all these\nthings right in either case we're still\ntalking long carbon chains so what a\nplant will do\nis bring in carbon and then it has this\nwonderful ability to use energy from the\nsun called photosynthesis and it can\ntake those carbons that it inhales and\nuse the energy from the Sun to form a\nbond now in our prior discussion when\nwe're going over hypertrophy we talked\nabout the energy that was required to go\nthrough protein synthesis that's because\nforming a new atom or a new bond between\natoms oftentimes takes energy in this\ncases it does the same thing happens\nhere so if a plant does not have oxygen\nor does not have carbon dioxide in the\nair it has no fuel the basically think\nabout it is that's what it eats it needs\nto get nitrogen from the ground in the\nsoil just like we need to get nitrogen\nfrom our protein but fuel wise it needs\nto get carbon dioxide then it needs sun\nto give it energy so it can actually\nform that Bond right that's what it's\ngetting its fuel from\nall right so if we think about\num a classic\nuh plant produce the plant that produces\neither a starch or a fruit here's what\nhappens\nit inhales that carbon and it starts\npacking it away now in a root vegetable\nwhat it does is it stores those things\ntogether and if we store that thing and\nwe grow fruit at the bottom of it we\ntend to call those things starches\nall right it's going to then take the\ncarbon that is packed away in its root\nand send it up the tree and it's going\nto actually do that by breaking it down\ninto a smaller form of carbohydrate that\nwe tend to often call things like\nsucrose and glucose it'll ship that up\nthe tree it'll go out to the leaves and\nit'll convert it into the fruit and it's\ngoing to eventually transform that stuff\ninto smaller carbon things called\nfructose and if we think about the fruit\nare the sugar in fruit it's often in the\nform of fructose or sucrose or a\ncombination and sometimes glucose so we\nhave these smaller carbon six carbon\nchains generally in the form of glucose\nthat are being made from this larger\nstorage of uh carbohydrates that we call\num starch right so it's packed in\ntogether\nyour body does the exact same thing so\nif it's a potato\nand it has a whole bunch\nof glucose packed away we call that\nstarch if it's in your quadricep and we\npack about a whole bunch of glucose Away\nWe Now call it glycogen if it's in your\nblood as that six carbon chain we call\nit glucose if it's in the tree and in\nthe fruit we call it fructose right\nthose are different molecules but that's\neffectively the same thing happens so\nthe biology or the chemistry is almost\nidentical it just runs in the reverse\norder and that's why again at tubers and\npotatoes and stuff tend to be starches\nand fruits tend to be glucose fructose\nof sucrose so we have this\na wonderful Circle of Life the plants\ncan survive on just breathing in the CO2\nand then getting the energy from the Sun\nwe don't have that ability at least to\nmy knowledge to run through\nphotosynthesis so the only way we can\nget carbon into our system is to\nactually ingest carbon which means we\nhave to eat the starch the fruit\nthe animal some other form of stored\ncarbon to get that into our system\nwe then pack that away we put the\ncarbohydrates as you mentioned earlier\neither on our liver\nour blood or in our muscles we put the\nfat generally in adipose tissue we'll\nput a little bit in muscle cells as\nintramuscular triglycerides and then the\nprotein will use as structure right to\ndo different things we don't like to use\nprotein as material or fuel it's better\nused as structure and what we have to do\nthen is if all of a sudden we realize\nthat storage is getting too much in our\nbody in other words we're gaining too\nmuch weight we have to figure out how to\nget the carbons out of our body\nand that is metabolism right anytime\nwe're trying to break a carbon bonds\nthough we can get energy to make ATP\nthat's going to release the carbon out\nof our tissue into the blood we have to\nbring in oxygen to bind that carbon\nmolecule to make CO2 so we can exhale it\nand put it back into the atmosphere it's\na beautiful description of the circle of\nlife and\nenergy utilization in the human body\nI have to ask the question that I'm sure\nmany people are wondering about which is\nif indeed we exhale these carbons and\nas it relates to Fat Loss that is the\nway that we lose fat if we're in a sub\ncaloric state for instance\nhas it ever been explored as to whether\nincreasing the duration or intensity of\nexhales can accelerate fat loss I mean\nthat's sort of The Logical extension of\nwhat you described and here I'm actually\ninterested equally in whether or not the\nanswer is yes as well as whether it\ncould be no because I could imagine if\nthe answer is yes well then there's some\ninteresting protocols to emerge from\nthat but that if it's no it will reveal\nto us some important bottlenecks about\nmetabolism and energy utilization you\never seen those magicians who like show\nup and uh they can tell your mom's name\nor something like that before you\nbecause they can sort of hold you down a\npath yeah I mean not to take us down a\ndeep dive tangent but I once went to the\nMagic Castle in Los Angeles and I was\none of the people called up front and a\nin an incredible magician a named um I\nthink his name was Ozzy mind or\nsomething uh I think that's right had me\nwrite my name on a card\nin a Sharpie pen I ripped up the card I\nripped it up I put it in my pocket\nand at the end of the 10 or 15 minute\nbout of him doing a bunch of other\ntricks\nhe asked me to look in my right shoe and\nunder my foot in my right shoe was that\ncard intact yeah and it was no longer in\nmy pocket and I swear in my life I\nwasn't a a collaborator with him and to\nthis day it still gives me chills\nbecause it well I I don't know how magic\nyeah right magic well the reason I say\nthat is I've given that little Spiel and\nI just gave you the countless times on\nmy glasses and I would say 99 of the\ntime as soon as I stop the very first\nquestion is\nso can I just like\ndo a bunch of exhales and lose fat which\nis wonderful because I was really hoping\nyou would do that and you rolled right\ninto my trap right you landed perfectly\nso I look like a like a a magician over\nhere I feel like I should look in my\nright shoe right now no I asked the\nquestion because it's the logical\nextension of what you laid out but\nI know biology to be um both uh\ndiabolical and cryptic but also\nExquisite in the way that things are\narranged and you don't get something for\nnothing there are no free passes in\nphysiology that's the saying no free\npasses the answer to your question is\nyes\n100 yes in fact that is the only way to\ngo about it you have two options you can\ningest less carbon or you can expel more\ncarbon people always say calories in\ncalories out it's really carbon in\ncarbonate\nthat's what a calorie is Right calories\nthe amount of energy we get per breaking\na carbon Bond so it's really Less in\nless more out less in is fairly obvious\nwhether that comes in any form and by\nthe way\nthis is exactly why the percentage of\nyour intake coming from fats or\ncarbohydrate it doesn't really matter\nthat much if you look at fat loss\nclinical trials you guys may have\ncovered this when Lane was in here I'm\nsure like this is something he talks\nabout a lot it doesn't matter it's\nirrelevant because it's not about that\nthere's nothing magic in those things\nthey are different they have different\nphysiological responses everything is\ndifferent right no duh but in general\nit's just simply about carbon intake\nturns out fat has a lot more carbons per\nmole than carbohydrates do so there's\nmore calories per mole in there so if\nyou the physical amount of fat needs to\ncome in as a smaller amount physical\namount of carbohydrates these are coming\nit will come in as a larger amount but\nyou can play\nany number of very high carb low fat\nwhat matters total calories right again\nit's not like the only thing that\nmatters but you know what I'm saying\nsome percentages in the way can go fat\nloss Works fantastic high fat low\ncarbohydrate why why do all these things\nwork because that's not about that it's\nabout total intake of carbon total Expo\nso absolutely can you lose fat by simply\nexhaling more in fact that is exactly\nwhat you did this morning\nwhen I hopped on the airline bike when\nyou did anything\nright the question is can you think of a\nscenario in which you could have a bunch\nof increased rates of exhalation\nthat helps in Fat Loss sure I can think\nof a lot of things that will stimulate\nincreased rates of exhalation one thing\ncould be simply going\nright and so the question is like can I\nliterally do some breath protocols where\nI force exhale and lose fat and the\nanswer is yes\nbut what happens what happens if you do\nhyperventilation training well my lab\nstudies cyclic hyperventilation is one\nof our many uh deliberate protocols and\none of the most prominent things that\none observes is that levels of\nadrenaline increase very quickly\nextremely quick people feel jittery\nanxious stressed and unless they are\nconsciously trying to Anchor their\nthinking about what that means and the\nbenefits that to persisting typically\nthey abort the cyclic hyperventilation\nprotocol really quickly within seconds\nright you will feel tingling sweating\nall kinds of things you're\nhyperventilating right and we could we\ncould talk a nauseam about how that\nchanges everything from adrenaline to\nfocus to a whole bunch of things so\nunfortunately a strategy of sitting\naround just exhaling more than you\ninhale\ntechnically helps you lose more fat but\nit's not going to last very long so then\nthe question is well how do I get no\nsituation or scenario in which I can\nincrease my rate of expiration\nwhere I'm not going to pass out I'm not\ngoing and altering hypocapny and\nhypercapnia issues\nany idea of a situation in which you\nwould have an enhanced rate of\nexplanation without worrying about\npassing out\nsure a steady state exercise or not\nsteady state exercise lifting weights\nintervals moderate training repeated any\nof these things they all work equally\nfor fat loss because all they're doing\nis increasing respiration rate they're\nsaying increased demand for energy\nincreased exhalation\nthat's the trick here and when you\nequate these things to that they have\nequal success in fat loss\nit doesn't matter theoretically\nwhere you're getting it from and so when\nwe get into this idea of well what are\nthe best training strategies for fat\nloss\nit doesn't matter which one of these\ntactics you pick\nas long as you maintain a consistent\nadherence over time\nbecause of this exact fact it doesn't\nmatter if you're burning quote unquote\nfat in the exercise session or if you're\nburning carbohydrates in the exercise\nsession it is totally irrelevant to your\nnet fat loss over time okay now there's\nsome significant misconceptions there\nabout what I just talked and I would\nlove to come back and walk through that\nin more detail but that's the main\ntake-home message here\nit won't matter what's coming in and it\nwon't matter what's coming out because\nin either case it is the same rate of\noxygen in and CO2 out that's the key\nmetric and hopefully this helps a lot of\npeople have some relief because they're\nlike man you're so tied up on what is\nthe exact protocol for training for\noptimizing fat loss what's the exact\nnutritional intervention I need for fat\nloss and then you wonder why all these\ndifferent diets can work effectively and\nwonder why all these different training\nprotocols you know surely you know\nsomebody who lost a bunch of weight and\nthe only thing they did is they just\nstarted running\nthere was no Advanced protocol they just\nstarted running and they ran five miles\nevery day that works and then tons of\npeople who tried that and like didn't\nlose anything and lots of people who\nwent to I went to cardio kickboxing\nclass lost weight oh I just started\ndoing intervals on my law why why\nmysteriously you'll do all these things\nwork\nthey had you have something had some\nspidey sense have to has to be going off\nin your brain where like there has to be\nsomething linking these things\nand what's linking it is simply carbon\nExchange\nso put yourself in a position in which\nyou are exhaling more than you and\ninhaling without passing out\nthe other problem is if you were to\nSimply do a breathing protocol\nwhile the rate of exhalation would go up\nafter that you would correct and go in\nthe opposite direction so that's the\nproblem is your net carbon the output\nover the course today is not going to\nchange unless you increase the demand\nfor energy and that's how you get into\nthat negative state\nalong these lines of exhaling carbons as\nthe route for fat loss\nit makes me wonder whether or not\nincreasing lung capacity is possible I'm\nguessing the answer is yes and whether\nor not\nincreasing lung capacity is a good goal\nand route to enhancing fat loss\nessentially what I'm asking is if you\ncan offload more CO2 okay carbons per\nexhale\nare you a more efficient fat loss\nmachine it's a wonderful thought and the\nanswer would be no\nnot something you worry about because\nif you were to Exhale more\ncarbon than actually needed\nnow we're in a state of inefficiency\nyou're burning way more energy than\nneeded to do your activity the heart has\na metric called cardiac output this is\nin Sciences we abbreviate this as Q\nfor some odd reasons it's either seal or\nq and cardiac output\nis heart rate multiplied by stroke\nvolume so it's how many beats per minute\nyou're having as well as how much\nblood's coming out of it so cardiac\noutput is actually\nvery specific to energy needs if you try\nto work around that it's just going to\nadjust itself so what I mean by this is\nif you were able to increase your stroke\nvolumes the amount of blood coming out\nper pump you would automatically adjust\nreduce your heart rate so that you keep\ncardiac output\nexact to energetic demands so you're\nsort of pushing one end of this of the\nspectrum but your body will pull the\nother one back to keep you at that exact\nsame neutral level so if you look at if\nyou think about like cardiovascular\nadaptations to endurance training and\nany type of endurance training a common\nthing people will understand is resting\nheart rate and so what that number is is\njust how many beats per minute you're\nhaving when you're sitting here doing\nnothing a very positive adaptation is a\nlowering of that resting rate over time\nas general numbers what you will hear is\npeople will say things like a normal\nresting heart rate is between 60 to 80\nbeats per minute and you know if any of\nthe things I've talked about\num with the individuals I work with I\ndon't work with anybody with disease\njust to clarify that I don't do anything\nwith disease management treatment\nanything it's always about people who\nare in a good spot\nwho want to optimize or get to the next\nlevel whether this is professional\nathletes trying to to Peak for physical\nperformance or uh the folks in our rapid\nHealth optimization program that feel\ngood again it's not disease stuff and\nthey want to feel incredible\none of the metrics we're going to pay\nattention to is this resting heart rate\nso here's what happens as you improve\nyour endurance\nyour resting heart rate will go down if\nI see somebody over 70 beats per minute\num unless something's going on you're\nnot physically fed\nregardless of whether or not that is\nquote unquote within the normative\nvalues I want to see everybody's sub 60\nbeats per minute or close right and that\ndoes not a difficult thing to really get\nto for most people so if you train a lot\nregardless of how you train intervals\nsteady state\ndoesn't matter that resting heart rate\nwill come down but since energy demands\nat rest haven't really changed cardiac\nAlpha stays the same so what happens is\nstroke volume goes up so literally like\nwe trained your quadriceps on the Legacy\nengine machine to get stronger so you\ncan produce more Force per contraction\nthe heart will do the exact same thing\nand so as you're able to get more of the\nblood out of your heart per pump\nthe heart realizes I don't need to pump\nas often\nso that's the compensatory adaptation\nwhich is saying hey look I don't need to\nbeat 60 times a minute I now need to\nbeat 55 times a minute because I'm\ngetting the same amount of Blood Out per\npump chill and this is why your resting\nheart rate goes down your resting stroke\nvolume goes up but your cardiac output\nis identical so that's not a good metric\nof Fitness it's going to stay the same\ncardiac output will only adjust for\nenergetic changes all right energy\nrequirements in the acute moment right\nhow much do I need go which is going to\nbe determined by ventilation right how\nmuch air am I bringing in and putting\nout that's going to determine cardiac\noutput and that's going to determine\nwhere we're at if you were to do like a\nsub maximal exercise test\nwhen you were unfit to when you're fit\nor when you're fit the way you're super\nfit at sub Max you're going to see the\nsame thing\ncardiac output will be identical and\nyou're like damn nothing happened what\nyou're not realizing is your heart rate\nat that same workload is now lower\nand that's efficiency because your\nstroke volume is higher where it gets\npeople tripped up is at Max\nbecause you may not see much of a change\nat Max because you won't really you\ndon't really see an increase in maximum\nheart rate with Fitness that's not a\nthing right so maximum heart rate is not\na good proxy for fit or unfit or\nanything like that stroke volume will\nget limited eventually by filling\ncapacity of your heart it has to have so\nmuch time to fill up with blood before\nit can contract again and squeeze the\nblood out and when you have a heart rate\nof 200 beats per minute that just\ndoesn't leave much time to fill and so\nit won't really push you past that so\ndon't worry about trying to increase\nyour maximum heart rate that's not\nnecessarily a good thing and it won't\nreally change but your cardiac health\nwill because stroke volume will be\nhigher but that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat I should avoid training that gets\nme up toward maximal heart rate correct\noh you should absolutely do it right\nthat's what that was my assumption I'd\nlike to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor athletic greens\nathletic greens is a vitamin

metabolism\nso we've got these different modes of\nmoving energy but making and breaking\nenergy Bonds in the body moving energy\ninto different tissues and out of\ndifferent tissues and indeed out of the\nbody through exhalation\nhow do each of these different modes of\nenergy utilization\nrelate to different modes of movement\nand exercise yeah in my mind I'm\nstarting to draw a bridge between\nokay when I walk for 60 minutes\nyou know if I'm talking I'm breathing a\nbit more maybe I'm burning a little more\nfat after all speech is a modified\nexhale\num and amazing if I'm sprinting\num breathing differently and if I'm um\nyou know doing a 30 minute moderate\nquote unquote moderate jog breathing\ndifferently so you've beautifully\nIllustrated this bridge between energy\nproduction and utilization and carbon\ndioxide offload through exhalation\nwhat are some of the specifics about\nenergy utilization\naccording to different modes of exercise\nand if we could better Define modes of\nexercise or types of exercise that\ntrigger specific adaptations I think\nthis is where the the bridge will move\nfrom being a a mere line to a real\nstructure yeah absolutely I want to lay\none more foundational piece and then\nit's going to be much easier to\nunderstand\nthe limitations I put on some of these\ntraining protocols as well as the lack\nof limitations okay so it's really\nreally important the way I want to start\nthis is\nwe have this this Foundation now of of\ncarbon and and basic energy production\nthat's not to say there's no difference\nthere is and that difference is\nimportant but maybe we can answer the\nquestion from earlier which is\nactually something you asked me this\nmorning when we were exercising\nyou're like training fasted\nright does training fasted\nenhance fat loss\nand the logic is sound if I don't have\nany fuel then I should be burning more\nfat therefore I should be losing more\nfat it's sound it's not true\nis this great idea it's one of these\nclassic things in science and exercise\nphysiology where like sounds good\nturns out it's not it's actually a\npretty gross misunderstanding of\nmetabolism\nso it's not to pick on that topic I\ndon't really care about that topic but\nit is a it's a common question it also\ngives me an opportunity to just tell you\nmore about metabolism so\nhere's what happens\nyou're breathing in O2 and breathing out\nCO2 however the ratio to that is what we\ncall the either rer respiratory exchange\nratio or RQ respiratory quotient and I'm\nnot going to differentiate those two\nthey're not the same thing but we're\ngoing to skip past that for now as you\nbegin to increase exercise intensity\nthe percentage of o2 to CO2 rises in the\nfavor of CO2 so you start breathing out\nway more CO2 than you are breathing in\nO2 right and so if we were to look at\nthat number you know once the\nrelationship Echoes up so at rest most\npeople have a of a value that we would\ntypically call something like 0.6\nokay and that's again the relationship\nbetween O2 and CO2\nmaybe 0.7 if you were to go for a walk\nthat increases slightly because you're\nnow expiring CO2 at a higher rate so now\nyou've moved up to say 0.8 or something\nlike that one of the ways that we Mark\nsomebody of achieving an actual VO2 max\non a test is if that value exceeds 1.1\nnow any of you who are paying attention\nare thinking wait a minute how the hell\ncan a ratio between two things ever get\npast one\nwell that's because you're getting in a\nplace where you're actually offloading\nmore CO2 than is actually necessary and\nthis is what actually causes and\nexplains a thing that people like to\ncall Epoch which is excess exercise post\noxygen consumption this is another way\nto think about it\nthe only reason you're breathing is to\nbring in oxygen when offloads CO2\nright\nif I'm no longer exercising why am I\nstill breathing\nin other words once you stop the demand\nor the need for for energy you should\nstop ventilating\nbut you don't\nright that's because in the case of low\nintensity exercise the second you stop\nyou're right back down to resting\nventilation no problem because you were\nable to match the need for energy with\nthe offload of waste one to one during\nthat exercise when you start creeping up\nthe intensity you can't do that so you\nhave to basically start stealing a\nlittle bit of fuel here so even though\nyou're done exercising you're still\nventilating because you have to pay that\nback and pay that back by that I\nspecifically mean you have to bring in\noxygen because you have a whole bunch of\nwaste that's been accumulating in your\ntissue that you've got to deal with and\nI'll walk you through what that waste is\nit's a particular molecule that a lot of\npeople have heard of but grossly\nmisunderstand\nso you got to be able to handle that so\nthe reason that you sit there and go\nand continue to ventilate is because\nyou're now trying to pay back that\nexcess post exercise oxygen debt that's\nthat oxygen debt we're specifically\ntalking about all right so\nthat being said as we start cruising up\nthat RQ starts going up up up up up up\nup and if we get to one your 1.0 you're\nyou're in a like you're hurting you're\nin a pretty good spot all right I like\nthat you're hurting you're in a pretty\ngood spot yeah a window into Dr Annie\ngalpin's mind now you really want to be\na subject in his uh his laboratory study\nsure\nmasochists swarm to Andy's lab\nabsolutely all right\nso\nthe idea that I will lose more fat\nby being in an exercise situation that\nis burning more fat it seems to make\nsense but it's a massive failure to\nunderstand the metabolism it's the exact\nsame explanation to like exercising\nfasted doesn't matter so the exercising\nfasted issue under normal circumstances\nis irrelevant because you have plenty of\nfuel in the system even when you haven't\neaten breakfast that morning now if\nyou're talking like extended fasting\nover multiple days this is a different\nscenario if muscle glycogen liver\nglycogen and blood glucose are at\nsufficient levels then you absolutely\nhave enough energy to perform almost any\ntype of exercise that most people are\ndoing\nyou know maybe if you're Rob and you're\nat Mile 20 today it's a different story\nbut the vast majority of us have plenty\nof fuel sitting around so we're not\ngoing to burn more into fat\num just because we didn't eat breakfast\nthat morning so that just doesn't make\nenergetic sense we have a lot of backup\nsupplies you're never out the trick here\nis this is there's a there's a concept\nhere we call crossover concept so as we\nare starting to move up exercise\nintensity\nwe start burning a higher percentage of\nour fuel from carbohydrates and a lower\npercentage of our fuel coming from fat\nI'm sleeping\nthat's the highest percentage of your\nfuel that will be coming from fat of any\nactivity you could ever do so if the\ntheory that I'm going to stay at a lower\nintensity to burn more fat was true the\noptimal fat burning strategy would then\nbe to sleep\nlike that doesn't make sense of course\nit doesn't so why would then going at a\nslightly elevated rate somehow all of a\nsudden magically make you lose fat\nit doesn't actually make sense when you\nthink about that where you're like oh\nyeah there's no way\nso\nit's a percentage trick it's a\ndifference between absolute and relative\nthis is what this confusion is so yes as\nyou start doing lower intensity exercise\nwhether you're faster than audit it's\nirrelevant but lower intensity exercise\na greater percentage of your fuel\nis coming from fat however your total\nfuel expenditure is very low\nso that whole total carbon balance is\nnot really being shifted much\nas you start exercising at a very high\nintensity you actually start getting a\nhigher percentage of your fuel from\ncarbohydrate and a lower percentage from\nfat in fact at rest about the highest\nyou can get in most people is about 60\nof your fuel from fat\nas you're sleeping you might be 70 but\nyou'll never be in a position ever no\nmatter what sort of thing you've heard\non the internet you'll never be in a\nsituation where fat is your only fuel\nsource\nthe highest I've probably ever seen is\nlike 70 percent\num you should probably beat about that\nthat's a kind of a good number to think\num honestly but people will understand a\nlittle bit about metabolism to be\ndangerous but not enough we'll we'll\nthrow out these terms like fat adapted\nand fat adapted is a real thing but is a\nmassive misunderstanding oftentimes\nright it is this idea thinking like I\ncan get into a spot where I'm maximizing\nfat burning maximizing fat burning\nand maximizing fat for exercise and\nmaximizing fat loss over time are not\nthe same thing at all right that's the\nconfusion so if you enhance fat\noxidation and exercise that does not\nenhance fat loss\nper se\nright so this is a lot of the confusion\nthat's happening\nright so as we start moving up we can\nnever get in a position where we're\nusing fat only as a fuel again at best\nyou're at 70 fat 30 carbohydrate for a\nlot of reasons we probably just don't\nhave time to get into today\nhowever the opposite is possible when\nyou get into true high intensity\nexercise you'll be basically 100\ncarbohydrate and zero percent fat all\nright that is very possible that in fact\nis 1.0 that's what our Q 1.1 is actually\nbecause your ventilation got so high you\nactually exceeded that number even\nthough you're at 100 carbohydrate this\nis what people came up with the idea\nthen it's like whoa I don't want to burn\ncarbs I want to lose fat\nso my response to that is always like\nokay great\nso it makes sense burning fat losing fat\nburning carbs is losing what then\nlike you think your liver shrunk like\nwait a minute what did you lose then\nwhere'd it come from it's all coming as\ncarbon don't worry about where it came\nfrom for your fuel\nit just has to come out as carbon\nright there are differences in exercise\nefficiency for performance with our\nprofessional athletes of course but if\nthe only goal here is phallus it doesn't\nmatter where you get it from\nthe last Bridge we have to connect here\nis like well wait a minute if I only\nburned carbohydrate\nhow did I actually lose that fat there\nwas there was that love handle sitting\non the side of me how did that come out\nof me if I never burned that from my\nfuel what you're failing to understand\nis there's a balanced game that happens\nhere so if you were to do a bunch of\nhigh intensity exercise training\nand you burned only muscle glycogen and\nblood glucose and maybe even you did it\nfor so long you burned some liver\nglycogen\nthe body understands that it has\nexpelled a lot of energy\nfrom that side of the equation it's\ngoing to do a couple of things now it's\nvery difficult\nto go through this fancy situation where\nyou convert carbohydrates into fat and\nback and forth like that's actually like\nfairly hard what's easier to do with\nsomething you said earlier is actually\njust bias energetics to a different fuel\nsource so in that scenario where you're\ndown really low in your carbohydrate\ncarbohydrate stores\nany carbohydrates you bring in are going\nto go to storage\nand since your net energy expenditure is\nsomething that your body regulates a lot\nany fat that you then bring in is going\nto be utilized as a fuel source because\nit knows it doesn't need it anymore that\nis in excess so that's how you actually\nuse fat\nas a fuel because you've burned down\ncarbohydrate storages\nas I'm hearing this uh a couple of\nthings come to mind first of all\nthank you for that incredibly important\ndescription of what is otherwise a very\nconfusing landscape for most people one\nof the key points I took away and\nI just want to say from the outset this\nis not exhaustive by any stretch is that\nburning fat does not equal losing fat\nfrom the body correct and then burning\nfat has to be divided into burning of\nbody fat stores\nand we need to distinguish that from\nburning of dietary fat that is brought\nin correct oftentimes people don't\ndisambiguate those correct\nand I'm also understanding that\nreducing one's body carbohydrate stores\nmuscle glycogen liver glycogen Etc\noccurs during high intensity exercise\nyep as well as other ways but that is\none very efficient way to tap into those\nstores which makes me wonder\nagain this is one of these things that\ndoes it lead to a protocol\nmakes me wonder whether or not doing\nhigh intensity let's say weight training\nfor 45 to 60 Minutes 75 minutes of\nstrength training power training\nhypertrophy training which we've covered\nin an episode about those topics\nand then doing some steady state\ncardiovascular exercise is there any\nbenefit to that arrangement\nthat would quote unquote enhance\nbody fat loss from the body to be very\nspecific now\nbecause unlike the idea that training\nfasted would shift the bias towards fat\nloss which it doesn't you've told us\nunder those conditions muscle glycogen\nand maybe even liver glycogen is going\nto be depleted\nput simply can I enhance body fat loss\nby doing some cardio after a bout of\nweight training if you equate for total\nenergy expenditure it won't matter\nnow that you did bring up a very\nimportant point that I want to clarify\nif you look at the exercise modalities\nthat we laid out in our previous uh\nconversations we talked about nine\ndifferent adaptations one was skill and\nthen speed power strength hypertrophy\nmuscular endurance anaerobic capacity\naerobic capacity and long duration\nendurance\nspeed\npower and skill development\nhave almost no benefit for fat loss\nbecause remember those are low weight\na lot of rest and low volume\nthey're not really really going to be\nhelpful you can make a little bit of a\ncase for strength\na little bit but the total energy\nexpenditure for strength training even\nif it's an hour if it's truly strength\ntraining it's fairly low because the\nrepetitions are in the one to three\nrange that's exactly it's not enough for\ntotal work so if you're trying to\ndevelop a protocol that sort of\noptimizes fat loss what you want to do\nyou were close in my opinion is do a\ncombination of something in the\nhypertrophy slash muscular endurance\nstrength training realm okay so\num six to Thirty repetitions something\nlike that resistance training great\ndeplete muscle glycogen maybe even a bit\nof liver glycogen maybe a little bit\ndepending on if you're doing it for a\nlong time but probably not a noticeable\namount okay so an hour of of uh\nhypertrophy type training if you're\ntraining hard with low responsibils and\nyou really did an hour you would for\nsure get there but most people don't\nbecause the reason why I crave large\nbowls of oatmeal and rice after I do\nweight training yeah and replenish\nmuscle glycogen totally right\num then you maybe do a little bit of\nvery high intensity maximum heart rate\nwell overview to Max uh hard as you can\nfor 20 30 45 60 seconds something like\nthat with some recovery\na lot of recovery and repeated and\nthat's going to do a great job of\nreplenishing muscle glycogen right if\nyou do that long enough you'll get the\nliver but again most people don't\nbecause it's really really hard to go\nthat hard so liver is sort of last Last\nResort yeah basic mechanics here which\nwill which we'll actually get into as\nour like third segment here\nis\nenergy production comes from the local\nexercising muscle first and foremost\nfrom phosphocreatine and carbohydrate\nstores right and so again and we store\nit in a muscle we call it glycogen right\nthat's it's your first sign of light on\ndefense if you need\nglucose outside of that you're going to\nstart pulling it from the blood but one\nof the things your body regulates a\nhandful of things over almost everything\nblood pH blood glucose blood pressure\nand electrolyte concentrations like it\nreally does not want to mess with those\nthings at all it will change almost\nanything else in the body to keep those\nthings standardized right you generally\nbecause you need all those things for\nyour brain to work and your brain will\nstop working right if you lose blood\npressure it won't go up there pH changes\nyou can't run metabolism electrolytes\nchange you can't think and glucose is a\nprimary fuel source for the brain it's\ngoing to be a problem right so if that\nnumber starts to come down because\nyou're grabbing glucose out of the blood\nyour liver is going to then kick in it's\ngoing to break down its glycogen to put\nglucose in the blood to keep the blood\nnumber the level in fact one of the\nthings you'll see is blood glucose\nconcentrations rise during exercise they\ndon't fall in fact they rise as an\nanticipatory state if you train a lot\nyour blood glucose will start going up\nbefore you start moving it knows it's\ncoming right so you you can play that\ngame you can rob Peter to pay Paul for a\nlong time and tell your liver runs out\nand that's what actually is a bonk in\nterms of like long duration endurance\nstuff you're talking many many miles\nseveral hours typically we say oh it's\ngot to be over two hours\nbefore your liver starts to become a\nreal problem or it has to be\ntremendously intense because of those\nreasons you have to burn through just a\nlot of energy before your liver starts\nto get into a problem you can continue\nto train when your muscle glycogen\nlevels are low\nin fact people say glycogen depletion\nand muscle but it's it's generally\nmisnomer and you are going to have\ntremendous signals of fatigue when that\nnumber gets lower than 75 percent\nso people think that like their muscles\nare getting heavy you're probably still\n75 full a lot of folks will quit around\nthe 50 the highest I've ever seen is\nlike 95 true depletion and that's an\nextremely high level cross-country\nskiers and like they're deltoid it's\nvery very low some very talented Runners\nwill get fairly low in their quads but\nthe vast majority of folks by the time\nyou're 50 depleted you're gonna quit\nit's going to be really really\nchallenging so you're never really going\nto get that low it's like a bit of a\nprotective mechanism right but when your\nliver gets low\nyou're going to be shut down and that's\nthe case of if you've ever been to like\na marathon and you've seen people run\nlike 25 and a half miles and then they\njust like Bonk they go into like baby\ndeers walking stands and then they\ncollapse and you're like how are you\nmentally weak like you ran 26 miles and\nyou can't run the last point it ain't\nmentally weak it is if your liver is\ndone it's gonna stop you because there's\nno more backup reserves muscle you can\nget away with you can push through it\nliver will not let you go any farther I\nfind this fascinating because it makes\nme wonder whether or not the liver being\ndepleted sends a neural signal to the\nbrain or the brain must register some\nsignal like I would like to be alive\ntomorrow thank you whatever is happening\nright now\num stopping is going to be safer than\ncontinuing yeah and so that stop signal\num is is one that I think a lot of\npeople including myself are are\nintrigued by because we always think\nthat it's uh related to willpower but\nthe brain needs to preserve itself and\nas the master computer I mean there are\nways to go into kind of automaton type\num you know not thinking just doing type\nuh Behavior you have override switches\nright and you can play those cards and\nyou can get better at learning and be\nbeing less sensitive to that switch\nthat's exactly what happened when you\nfirst start training right you start to\nrealize like oh my gosh I'm super tired\nthen you realize really quickly like oh\nI'm totally fine here and this is like\nthe\npick pick your person who's made sayings\nlike this but it's like you're really\nonly 10 percent depleted or 30 or 40 or\nsomething we're all operating 40 of what\nwe could do of course any of those\nthings are true because it is like a\nlittle bit of an override um you've just\ngotten very sensitive to being a small\npercentage depleted and you've learned\nokay I'm tired and there is a long way\nto go past that but once you get past\nthat and you flip that override switch a\nlot\num you just you're going to break\nquickly because you basically learn to\nignore that signal and problems can\nhappen really quickly after that and\nthat's even experienced endurance\nathletes if you hit that level\nit's like you're going to be hitting the\nconcrete next and that's you know\npotentially a problem\nI want to make sure I understand a\nconcept that you referred to earlier\ncorrectly because I have a feeling that\nI don't and that's this issue of\nhow the body accesses body fat stores\nwhen in a sub caloric State and I'm\ndoing mainly glycogen burning exercise\nyeah\nwhat I heard you say and please correct\nme where I'm undoubtedly wrong\nwhat I heard you say was that okay I go\ninto the gym and I start\nlifting weights I'm burning muscle\nglycogen mostly local to the muscles\nthat I'm using and then I start pulling\nglycogen from the bloodstream\nmaybe there's some\nbody fat stores that are mobilized\nprobably not dipping into my liver\nglycogen\nokay I complete the workout maybe I even\nhop on the air dime bike and do a little\nSprint yeah go for a jog maybe\num I eat immediately afterward maybe I\ndon't eat for a few hours afterwards but\nacross the day I ingest fewer calories\nthan I burn\nis it the case that body fat is\nmobilized in order to replace the\nglycogen that my sub\ncaloric intake\nwas insufficient to provide in other\nwords because I didn't eat enough to\nfill the glycogen stores\nam I using body fat\nconverted into glycogen to fill those\nstores right\nand if so is that a case where I'm no\nlonger exhaling carbons in order to burn\nbody fat but rather I'm repurposing body\nfat into muscle have I turned fat into\nmuscle in that case yeah I'm really glad\nuh you asked this because I did a very\npoor job on that last Point talking\nabout earlier I'm realizing playing back\nin my head because that's so many really\ngood questions you cannot turn fat into\nmuscle\ncan you turn muscle into fat no I'm so\nglad you said that because when I was in\ncollege yeah our I don't want to out\nthat person the physiology teacher\nseem to think still at that point that\none could lift weights get muscular but\nthen it would eventually turn into body\nfat that that I that myth has I think\nlargely been dispelled I heard that so\nmany times\nas a kid I heard it so many times in\ncollege I heard it so I hear it so many\ntimes in our\nuh undergraduate students from other\nfaculty and such so\num no like they're not the same\nstructures they are very different um\nlet me take you out on answering this\nbetter you're really really close so\nyeah\nif you were to do that type of exercise\nwhere you've burned a lot of muscle\nglycogen how is it I'm losing stored fat\nright that's really the Crux of the\nquestion and it doesn't even actually\nmatter if you then went ahead and\ningested carbohydrates or fat post\nexercise\nthat's not really a thing you hit on a\ncouple of key things number one this is\nall under the assumption that total\ncaloric intake\nis still low right you have a total need\nit's below okay\nI also want to flag calories in calories\nout is not the only thing that matters\nthis is a very complex thing calories in\nis incredibly complicated calories out\nis even more complicated okay so we just\nmaybe another series we can spend on\nthat alone all right so don't don't go\nnuts about that\nyou have to be hypocaloric one way or\nthe other if you burn a bunch of muscle\nglycogen and you are hyper caloric\nyou're still going to add fat\nif you burn a muscle glycogen and you're\nhypochloric you're going to lose fat\nright think about it this way\nyou're in a negative calorie state\nwhere are those calories going to come\nfrom are you going to reduce your muscle\nglycogen storages permanently no no are\nyou going to reduce your glycogen\nstorage in your liver\nno you want to reduce blood glucose no\nno way right so where is that extra\nenergy coming from it's coming from your\nstored fat it is your backup Reserve\nEnergy System um the way that I want to\nfly this here is people tend to think\nabout it as like carbohydrates versus\nfat that's not it's more like a chain\nmore like a bicycle where there's a\nfront gear and a back gear you turn one\ngear it turns the other one these are\ncomplementary systems they are not and\nor systems right you're turning one and\nwhen we go through carbohydrate\nmetabolism maybe here in a second you'll\nunderstand why you have to have an\nanaerobic and an aerobic component to\nthat there is absolutely no way to\ncomplete carbohydrate metabolism without\noxygen that has to happen the only way\nto engage in fat metabolism is aerobic\nand oxygen there's no anaerobic\ncomponent to it there's a fundamental\ndifference there\nso the your carbohydrates are meant to\nbe incredibly flexible it is the primary\nfuel source for a reason your fat is not\nmeant to be flexible it is meant to be\nUnlimited that's the basic point so you\nwant flexibility over here and an\nunlimited capacity over there now I'm\nsafeguarded against any energetic need\nokay I need to run up a hill for safety\ncool carbohydrates are there I need to\nthen run for 17 hours cool fat is there\nwe want both of these systems you want\nto be able to have great energy\nthroughout the day\nyou want a slow drip coming from fat you\ndon't want up and down up and down feel\ngreat up and down awesome you want to be\nable to think very quickly and get hyper\nfocused boom carbohydrates ramp right up\nright get it into the brain get thinking\nbetter get thinking clearly fast so we\nwant all these not just for exercise\npurposes for but for activities of daily\nliving we want an optimal system here\nand when people use the terms like fat\nadapted they're generally hijacking that\nand they're thinking it used to be a\nthing we said all the time and like all\nof my undergraduate classes for years\nand that idea of metabolic flexibility\nis using optimal fuel sources and\noptimal types not maximizing fat usage\nthe people have co-opted that term of\nmetabolic flexibility to be like oh yeah\nyeah therefore learn how to maximize fat\nburning that's not what that term means\nthat term means maximizing your ability\nto use whatever fuel is optimal in that\ntime\nnow I'll Grant you most people\naren't fantastic and using fat as a fuel\nsource relative to the other direction\nbut nonetheless the the gold standard\nhere should be maximizing both\nall right finally answering your\nquestion if I were to to burn a bunch of\nmuscle glycogen how am I losing that fat\nwell the fuel you're ingesting in that\nhypochloric state is going to say hey\nlook we have a lot of muscle glycogen we\nhave to replenish so any carbohydrate\nthat comes in needs to be biased towards\nstorage\nit's got to go into those tissue any fat\nthat comes in or doesn't even come in\nbut any fat that we're using for fuel\nneeds to be utilized for activity\nand that's where the caloric expenditure\nfrom fat comes in so you're basically\nsaying you're\nGeneral physiology\nthe energy for that starts coming from\nfat and the energy that's coming in from\ncarbohydrate needs to be simply stored\nand so what you see is your respiratory\nquotient changes right the rer is going\nis going off and so in the exercise\nmoment it shot way up for carbohydrates\nand shot way down for fat\nas the compensatory response it goes the\nother direction because your body's\nsaying we are low on carbohydrates don't\nuse them for fuel unless we absolutely\nhave to right so use them for storage\nget our fuel\nfrom the fat side of the equation and so\nwhat you're generally going to say is\nlike oh I'm burning more fat just\nsitting around\nafter things like that and that's not\neven taking into the equation the epoch\npart which is like it's not actually as\nlarge as people think it is it's fairly\nsmall\nbut it is it adds up sort of over time\nso um does that explain a little bit\nbetter about how you lose fat when you\nactually only burn carbs for exercise\nyou explained it beautifully\nyou talked about Epoch the post-exercise\noxygen consumption yeah not being that\nsignificant in terms of energy\nutilization\neven though today we're talking about\nendurance and different forms of\nendurance I do have to ask whether or\nnot people consider the\nelevation in basal metabolism that\noccurs when there's more muscle around\nyeah because muscle is such a\nmetabolically demanding tissue\num you know if is there a\nstraightforward-ish equation you know if\none adds one pound of of lean muscle\ntissue to their body even if it's\ndistributed across multiple muscle\ngroups does that equate to a caloric\nneed of X number of calories per day and\nis that because of the muscle protein\nsynthesis needs of that muscle or it's\nglycogen storage needs or both if you\ndon't have enough muscle you start to\nhave problems with fat loss it's\ndifficult challenge if you have enough\nmuscle and you're just trying to get\nextremely large if your ffmi is 24 and\nyou're 15 body fat adding more muscles\nnot really going to play a lot in the\nequation and here's why\nmuscle is more metabolically active at\nrest than fat but fat is not inert so\nfat is still going to burn a small\nnumber of calories muscle burns more but\nit's not nearly what people think it is\nI'm a muscle guy I'm a muscle\nphysiologist I would love to get people\nto have more muscle for any excuse I can\nit's not honest to say that though\nyou're talking about when I was in\nundergraduate we would say numbers like\n50 Cake House per day per pound\nis what you can look at right so if you\nput on a pound of muscle spread across\nthe body your basal metabolic rate would\ngo up by around 50 calories per day\nI think that number is grossly\nexaggerated it's probably a tenth of\nthat\nsix to ten calories maybe um it's hard\nto know exactly what that number is but\nthe more recent estimates are are\nsomething like that so now on one hand\nyou could say oh my gosh that is not\neven meaningful the other hand you could\nsay that's super meaningful it just\ndepends on time domain you want to put\nthat out right so if you were to put on\nfive pounds of muscle and your basal\nmetabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories\na day well over the course of a thousand\ndays\nlike that actually adds up so you you\ncould slice this any way you want\num now maybe that number somewhere in\nbetween I don't really know it's not a\nfield I paid that much attention to\ncandidly\nbecause it's not a metric kind of like\nepoch\num where it's like we used to really\nharp on it and now it's sort of like wow\nmaybe we exaggerated that like honestly\njust a bit but to me it doesn't change\nthe equation much because if you don't\nhave enough muscle as they describe\nthere are other consequences that are\ngoing to make fat loss hard and so you\nneed to have sufficient muscle\nif the additional caloric expenditure is\nthe carrot great if it's something else\nI don't really care there's just enough\nevidence that you need to have it or I\nshould say there's enough evidence that\nit will really help you in your path\num maybe a few calories here there is\nnot really the thing especially if you\nunderstand\na normal food item\nanything you pick is going to be\nprobably a couple of hundred calories\none bad food Choice a day well out kick\nalmost any amount of coverage you got on\nadding muscle mass to you so like\nyou're really stepping over a dollar to\npick up a dime if you're worried about\nhow many calories you're getting from\nadding muscle\num fat loss is going to be about\nregulating that carbon intake above and\nbeyond anything else\nI'd like to take a brief break to\nacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term health and well-being can\nonly be analyzed from a quality blood\ntest one issue with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there however is that\nyou get information back about various\nlevels of lipids and hormones and\nmetabolic factors Etc but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information inside\ntracker makes knowing what to do with\nall that information exceedingly easy\nthey have a personalized platform that\nlets you see what your specific numbers\nare of course but then also what sorts\nof Behavioral do's and don'ts what sorts\nof nutritional changes what sorts of\nsupplementation would allow you to bring\nthose levels into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nany of inside tracker's plans again\nthat's insidetracker.com huberman to get\n20 off so I've heard about this concept\nof metabolic flexibility mentioned a few\ntimes\nfrankly you're the first person who's\never explained it to me in a clear and\nconcise way how do I know if I am\nmetabolically flexible and how do I\nincrease my metabolic flexibility sure\nthere's no specific standard which is\nactually a good thing right and so if\nyou have a level of specificity that you\nwant or need metabolically then you\ndon't actually want to be in this Middle\nGround an example would be if you are a\nperforming in a type of exercise or an\nathlete who performs in a sport that is\nglycolically dominated you don't want to\nbe optimally metabolically flexible you\ndon't want to be super quote unquote fat\nadapted you want to be biased towards\nthe energy you're going to use the same\ncould be true for the other end of the\nspectrum so in those particular cases\nit's not optimal\nto be equally effective because there\nare no free passes in physiology right\nyour\nenergy producing systems\nwill up regulator down regulate\naccordingly so you will actually limit\nyour ability to say maximally utilized\ncarbohydrate as a fuel if you're trying\nto up regulate your ability to use fat\nas a fuel and so this is like there's a\nsaturation point\noutside of that Spectrum most people\njust say hey like I want to feel great\nthroughout the day to be able to do a\nbunch of different things how do you\nknow a couple things\nthere's a lot of biological markers you\ncan take there's also just some some\npractical takes now none of these\nmarkers\nby themselves are any sign what you want\nto do is probably a couple of them\nand then say okay this is maybe a clue\nso again it's really important to\nemphasize not a single one of these\ntests that I'm about to walk you through\nautomatically means you can't use fat as\na fuel or the other case which is maybe\nyou're poor using carbohydrate as a fuel\nso disclaimers aside\nwe'll get into a couple of them so\nshould we think about these as\ninformative and useful but not\ndiagnostic exactly what we call this\ndata inspired or data LED and not data\ndriven\nright okay cool so number one you want\nto think about just overall\nfunctionality do you have a reasonable\nregulation of your energy throughout the\nday now many things could be going into\nthis which is why these are not specific\nDiagnostics but as a basic measure we\ntalked about blood glucose levels\num you know a lot of people will say\nagain you want that to be something like\nbetween 80 and 90\num milligrams per deciliter is the blood\nglucose level and you can go look at the\nthe cutoff points for what determines to\nbe pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic Etc\num what I can actually recommend um this\nis there's a little bit of science here\nactually that I'll walk you through but\na lot of this is my personal preference\num I generally want people to be at 85\nor lower and that's because of a couple\nof things number one there's actually\nsome papers that showed any uh every\nsingle point increase\nabove 85 increases your likelihood of\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes by about 6\npercent\nokay great so technically while maybe 90\nor 95 or even up to 100 are you know in\nthe quote-unquote normative values\nthat's one clue again it's not\ndefinitive by itself doesn't mean\nanything\nyou need to really pay attention to what\nincreasing by six percent actually means\nbut it's a data point where I'm looking\nat if I actually then see symptomology\nand we run you through maybe some\nquestionnaires ask how you're feeling\nthroughout the day and we see\nuncontrolled energy about so you're a\nlot of energy then get really really\ntired and swings okay another data point\nall right and we may patch a few of\nthese things together that may give me\nsome Clues\num that being said\nagain this a lot of this rhetoric is\nused to then scare people off of\ncarbohydrates and that is I want to be\nas clear as possible that is not\nnot truly\num\nthe only thing people should care about\nright it can be a thing that can also be\nunrelated there are reasons you could\nhave blood glucose concentrations at\nthis level or energy swings that are\nunrelated to carbohydrate ingestion at\nall\nall right so one test you can either run\nin addition to that if you're going to\nget blood glucose measured you can look\nat some markers we talked about earlier\nRichard AST and ALT what we talked about\nhow you can kind of look at that AST to\nLT ratio before you can actually do the\ninverse which is look at alt and AST the\nkind of normative value there you're\ngoing to look at is like 0.8 I actually\nlike to see it lower than that and that\nalone has been actually associated with\nblood glucose dysregulation and so if\nyou've seen multiple of science again\nwe're looking for patterns and patterns\nand patterns in both in our case\nbiomarkers symptomology and performance\nand now you're if all three of those\nthings are lining up you may have an\nissue so performance wise\na couple of little tests you can run\num ideally you have some sort of\nstandard workout you do oh and hopefully\nit's it's pretty objective so in other\nwords like uh I run the same 15 minute\nLoop every morning for my cardio okay\ngreat how long does it take you to run\nthat Loop like you could pick whatever\ndistance it doesn't really matter what's\nyour heart rate during that thing and\nthen what's your perceived exertion now\nyou should be able to do that fasted\nwith very little drop in performance\nokay if you can do that then that tells\nme you're fairly good at using a fat as\na fuel source if however the one day you\ngo to do your standard workout\nand you feel awful\nfasting that may be another clue that\nperhaps you're not very good at dialing\nin\nthat system if your recovery afterwards\nin terms of heart rate recovery is very\nlong it may be another clue that you\nhave a poor utilization of fat as a fuel\nsource the inverse can also be true\nso if I give you something in the\nneighborhood of like 50 or so grams of\ncarbohydrate\nand 30 minutes later your face is\nfalling off the table that's a good sign\nthat you're in the opposite you're\nactually very very very poor utilizing\ncarbohydrate as a fuel and the reason I\nbring that up is\num that is equally a problem we send we\nhear people a lot make comments\num like man I have to stay away from\ncarbs I crash really hard if I do them\nthat has a what that actually means is\nyou're very poor at utilizing\ncarbohydrates as fuel you're getting a\nyour uh your sensitivity is way off we\nshould be able to have carbohydrate at a\nreasonable dosage 50 grams and not fall\nasleep 30 minutes later or have to run\nto caffeine so that is a sign in our\nopinion this is again now just my\npractical brain telling you is that's a\nsign of dysfunction we should be able to\nhave plenty of carbohydrates through the\nday if we choose to if we want to for\nany reason now of course if you were to\nthrow 150 or 200 grams of carbohydrate\nin your belly\nyou're probably going to take a little\nbit of an energy hit after that but we\nshould be able to have a reasonable\ndosage and not you know have to fall\nasleep afterwards\nwhat is one way that people can enhance\ntheir utilization of carbohydrates uh\nfor exercise the reason I ask is I think\nI fall into that category yep um I do\nconsume some complex carbohydrates and\nfruit post\nresistance training and that tends to be\nwhen I'm hungriest for them but\ntypically unless I'm I've just done some\nresistance training I keep most of my\ndaytime meals relatively low\ncarbohydrate and then in the evening I\nprefer slightly less protein and more\ncarbohydrate because it has this effect\nof\num sedating me a little bit yeah and I\nsleep well and I know this runs against\nwhat everyone was taught which is to not\neat carbohydrates late in the day but I\nlike it because then I tend to wake up\nin the morning\nwith at least as far as I can tell my\nglycogen stores not necessarily topped\noff but but certainly filled yep um and\nI'm able to train fasted in the morning\nand my favorite pre-workout is consists\nof water and caffeine and electrolytes\nand maybe some supplementation as well\nbut I love training fasted so there's\nactually a number of things um\none little sneaky thing you threw in\nthere is actually the use of caffeine so\nthat's another sign if if you have to\nhave caffeine to do your fasted training\nthat's generally another sign you're not\nvery good at using fuel so I use\ncaffeine prior to resistance training\nworkouts generally I don't need it for\nany kind of cardiovascular training yeah\nand when I say that it doesn't mean it's\nbad\nit's just like another clue that's like\nokay you should be able to do this\nwithout having to have caffeine to\nexecute it now using caffeine to get a\nbetter result is sort of different as an\nergogenic aid um we actually use\na lot of high carbohydrate meals at the\nend of the day a lot of the times for\nour athletes who are cutting weight or\ntrying to reduce weight so it is a\nfantastic way to handle a lot of things\nand that idea that if you eat carbs late\nat night\nthat'll increase fat so like that's all\nis so old and so well destroyed\nscientifically that that's not a concern\num there's just so much data showing in\nfact there's so much data on\nlike eating timing is is uh generally\npoorly understood about when you can eat\nand what you can eat eating in the\nmorning\num versus eating at night like a lot of\nwhat we've heard in there is stuff in\nmaybe we just saved that for sort of\nanother day because we're going to get\nreally far down that's about our weekend\nyeah but yes I think our plan is to\ncover that in an episode on nutrition\num okay which is in this series the uh\nthe only thing that would add to it is\nyou know would you hear about ingesting\ncarbohydrate late at night I should just\nsay that uh at least in my case I'm\neating the majority of my carbohydrate\nunless\nI trained yeah resistance trained early\nin the day and which guess I I post\nresistance training\num in the last meal of the day but for\nme that's not really late at night that\nlast meal is somewhere between 6 30 and\n7 30 p.m so it's three or so hours or\nsomething like that before we go to\nsleep around 10 10 30 or so yeah so it's\nnot you know midnight uh bowls of pasta\nI've done that too but um but typically\nit's not so I think that um people will\nbe very interested uh myself included in\nhow meal timing relates to all of this\nbut\num yeah let's\nso how do you improve fat utilization\nhow do you improve carbohydrate\norganization let's Hammer both out\nreally quickly\num enhancing fat uh utilization is as\nsimple as doing a little bit of work in\na\neither pre-fat ingested state\nso anytime you ingest a nutrient prior\nto training you're going to bias towards\nthat nutrient\nright which is almost what we were\ntalking about earlier so if you want to\nguarantee you burn more fat eat more fat\nprior to a workout now you're not going\nto lose fat but what you're what you're\neffectively signaling is we have an\noverabundance of this fuel\npreferentially Target this fuel\nnow the downside is that may actually\nhinder your performance that's typically\nonly a concern for people at a very high\nlevel\num\nfat is a slower fuel source so if you're\nrelying more upon that your top end is\ngoing to come down a little bit and so\nyou wouldn't want to use that strategy\nprior to race if it is a carbohydrate\ndependent race\nall right and in fact we actually see\nlong-term adaptations that would suggest\nthat so the enzymes responsible for\ncarbohydrate metabolism will down\nregulate and so you'll get worse at that\nso not not a great strategy there\ncarbohydrate be the opposite right so if\nyou have carbohydrate prior to exercise\nyou're going to bias more towards that\nso a handful of things you can do\nif your total caloric intake is simply\nmanaged that's going to take care of a\nlot of these problems an appropriate\neating strategy so the types of food the\ncombinations of food\nall those things are going to make your\npost carbohydrate ingestion bunk a lot\nof those things can go away so there's a\nlittle bit of physiology that has to be\ncorrected for so it's a little bit\nin one hand you can go very deep here\nright so the real answer of how we would\ndo this is if we see a scenario like\nthat we're going to do a whole set of\nanalyzes we're going to go full Labs\nright probably extensive blood panel\nurine saliva stool even and we're going\nto figure out where is that glucose\ndysregulation coming from so a lot of\npeople think like oh it's a metabolism\nissue it might be it also might just be\na flag that something else is happening\nin the body so we're going to actually\nwork backwards a lot to try to figure\nout exactly why that's occurring it may\nbe as simple as oh you're eating a lot\nof your carbohydrates\nwithout any fiber or protein and we know\nthat that's important because those will\nactually blunt the glycemic index like\nthe rise in blood glucose so it could be\na simple thing of just like oh your\ncombination of food is doing it it's not\nthe total amount um it may be something\nagain more endogenous to the actual\nsystem\nuh it could be\num a heart rate issue it could be a\nbreathing issue there could be a number\nof things so the way to get better at it\nis to Simply train it and specificity is\nKing here so if you want to get better\nat managing your blood glucose\nthroughout the day so you're not feeling\nthose things it could be a fuel issue\nbut it could be a number of other things\nand it's just hard to go into all of\nthem with within our time constraint so\nthe Practical tool that I would say here\nis if you want to get better at managing\nenergy throughout the day make sure that\nnumber one your protein is stabilized\nmaking sure number two you're ingesting\nyour food in the right combinations\nideally with some Fiber\nand or some protein or both that alone\nwill help stabilize a lot of the\nproblems then you need to train at a\nhigh intensity you want to get better at\nusing carbohydrates as a fuel train at a\nhigher intensity and have carbohydrates\nright before the workout we'll do that a\nlot if um\nuh if our if we see folks who are I kind\nof walk you through the test of\nidentifying if you're not very good at\nusing fat as a fuel the tests for not\nbeing good at using carbohydrate is the\nfuel is both that eating test I talked\nabout as well as performance if you're a\nvery very very slow starter it's just\nlike really hard to get going that\ngenerally indicates\nyou might be in a situation where you're\nnot very good at using carbohydrates as\na fuel so we're going to practice that\nwe're going to have a pre-carbohydrate\npre-exercise carbohydrate meal then\nwe're going to do higher intensity stuff\nnot the point of making you sick and\ndigestive issues all that stuff but we\nwant to get better at using\ncarbohydrates as a fuel faster if you\nwant to get better at doing the opposite\nthen you do that opposite starter either\nagain using the fat prior to the workout\nknowing\nyour Peak Performance is going to go\ndown a little bit but you're you're\ninvesting in adaptation right so it's\nnot about that workout it's about what's\ngoing to happen six eight ten weeks from\nnow investment is what you want to think\nabout it or you could bring in some\nfasted training and so I want to really\nmake sure I clarify when we were talking\nabout it earlier I'm not at all against\nfasted training it's not it works it's\njust isn't required for fat loss it\nisn't required for fat adaptation it is\na great option though if you want\num what I was hoping to do with that\nconversation and maybe I didn't\narticulate that well is to not restrict\npeople but is to open you up and they'll\nsay you have a lot of options if you\nlike to do fasted cardio amazing it is\ngreat if you hate it you don't have to\nyou can reach the same performance goals\nthe same physique goals without ever\ndoing it if you love long duration\nsteady state stuff it is great if you\nhate it there are other options higher\nintensity stuff again if we're just\ntalking about fat loss so\nI hope now that that's a little clearer\nin terms of the same thing with\nnutrition if you like higher carb great\nif you like lower carb these are all\ngreat you have options and you don't\nhave to fret so much over oh my gosh I\nhave to do this thing a certain way and\nI absolutely hate it you don't have to\nworry about it hit those Concepts\nand you'll be fine\na few minutes ago you mentioned that if\nwe ingest a given macronutrient fat then\nthe body will preferentially use that\nfuel source\nyou ingest carbohydrate we'll use that\nfuel source\nis it always the case that the body uses\nthe ingested macronutrient prior to\nusing glycogen I have to imagine it's\nusing both I mean if I were to have some\ncarbohydrate be before\num doing any kind of training the\nmuscles still burn glycogen right or do\nthey have some way to register the\namount of circulating carbohydrate that\nwould allow or available carbohydrate in\nthe form of food stuffs uh that would\nallow them to not tap into their own\nmuscle fiber stores with glycogen all\nright so the way we derive energy for\nexercise or basic maintenance a little\nbit about cellular physiology so you've\ngot a couple of organelle and structures\nthat we need to pay attention to the\nfirst one is the nucleus let's Hold You\nDNA the second one is the mitochondria\nand then everything outside of that\nyou've got all these other organelle\nthat do a bunch of things like ribosomes\nfor protein synthesis etc etc all right\nnow\nwhen you want to produce energy for\nexercise\nanytime you hear the word anaerobic you\nautomatically understand we are meaning\nwithout oxygen\nall right great that all happens in the\ncytoplasm the cytoplasm is that space\nthat is not the mitochondria not the\nnucleus so it's the space in between\neverything else this is like jelly-like\nsubstance that sounds there so anaerobic\nmetabolism happens there every single\naerobic\nmetabolic process happens in the\nmitochondria\nall right why is that important\nif I go to create cellular energy and I\nneed it the fastest possible I'm going\nto go for phospho creatine because it is\nstored directly in the cytoplasm the\nstoichiometric is one to one there which\nmeans for every mole of phosphocreatine\nI burn I can create one ATP it's one to\none it is incredibly fast but it is very\nlimited because think about how much of\nthat could I possibly store in the small\nsize of the cell that's it if I need\nenergy past that point now I'll start\nusing muscle glycogen\nbecause that is also stored in the\ncytoplasm so it is right there the\nStoichiometry is not one to one it's a\nlittle bit higher probably like four to\none so for every molecule of glycogen\nyou burn you're going to get something\nlike four ish some small number of ATP\nout of that which is great\nbut again you're running into a storage\nproblem how much can I possibly store\ninside a muscle cell it is very very\nfast much more effective than phosphor\ncreatine but so there\nif I then want to metabolize any form of\nfat\nor if I want to complete the\nmetabolization\nof carbohydrates I have to start\ntransferring into the mitochondria now I\nstart getting whole hosts of ATP if you\nwere to fully run through this thing\nwhich I'll talk about in a second I'm\ncalled the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle\nyou'll get now something like 28 or 30\nor 35 kind of depending\nATP per so the energetic output is much\nhigher\nokay so here's exactly what happens then\nI'm going to walk you through this in\nthe form of carbohydrate and then I'll\ncome backwards and go through fat\nso remember\ncarbohydrate it is one carbon molecule\nthat has been hydrated so it is one to\none so the actual\nchemistry here it is\nC\nH2O\none carbon two H one o glucose is a six\ncarbon chain so the chemistry here is C6\nh12o6 six carbons six Waters very simple\nthat's a carbohydrate all right so you\ncan imagine if you're watching on the\nvideo here you'll you'll see my fingers\ngoing nuts I'll try to make sure I\nexplain it to you all just listening in\nan easy fashion so you've got this chain\nof six carbons as in front of you and\nthe very first step the metabolism is\nyou snap that thing in half\nright so you break into two separate\nthree carbon chains all right now in\ndoing that you've got a little bit of\nenergy because you broke that one Bond\nbut not a tremendous amount this is\ncalled glycolysis so lysis being the\nsplit and you know glycoping like you\nsplit\nglycogen up got a little bit of energy\nof them\nall right you formed this three color\ncarbon chain called pyruvate or pyruvic\nacid okay there's differences there but\ndon't don't kill me\nGeneral audience friends all right I\ngotta gotta give this communicate this\nto everybody\nso you got a little bit of that now you\ncan't do much past that besides rip one\nmore carbon off of each of those three\ncarbon chains so I've got two three\ncarbon chains I'd have to be careful how\nI do this with my finger so I don't flip\nyou off here in a second but I burn one\nmore off of each I get a little bit of\nenergy and now that little two carbon\nchain I have two two concrete chains\nthose are called acetyl-coa all right\namazing I have now completed anaerobic\nglycolysis I've got really nothing left\nI can do here I made a little bit of ATP\nnow wait a minute\nI have now freed\ntwo carbons because remember I started\nwith six and I splited them apart but I\ndidn't I had two three carbon chains I\nburned one each I've got two free\nfloating carbons I have to now do\nsomething with them my body will not let\nme go through that part that last\nprocess unless I've got a plan for that\nfree Carbon because I can't break it in\nhalf\namazing here's what's going to happen\nif I have those three carbon molecules\nand I don't have anywhere I can put that\ncarbon\nyou're not going to go through that\nprocess\nit's going to stop it\nyou're going to start building up\npyruvate\nnow at the same time you're breaking ATP\nfor fuel that's called ATP hydrolysis\nright you have water that comes in you\nhave a condensing and three phosphates\nthat's why it's called ATP adenosine\ntriphosphate one two three you break one\nof those phosphates off\nthere you go there's your energy so now\nyou have a free floating inorganic\nphosphate and an adenosine dye phosphate\nso two over there amazing that actually\nresults because you use water for it\nresults in a free-floating hydrogen ion\nokay just have to trust me hydrogen H2O\nany idea what a free floating hydrogen\nis\num it's gonna\nthat's acid yeah it says I was gonna say\nit's going to increase acidity that's\nwhat I said for anyone that's ever\nmeasured pH what you're really measuring\nis the the amount of hydrogen potential\nhydrogen that's what PH is Right 100\nthere's two definitions of pH but you\nget that's one of the two so is this are\nyou going to tell me this is related to\nthe the burn\nwe're going to get close right so I've\ngot a bunch of free floating\num you've got the phosphates which are\nactually a problem two probably more of\na problem Than People realize and that\nhydrogen\nwhat are you going to do with that\nhydrogen well one thing you can do is\nactually ship it over to pyruvate and\nbond it there\nwe have a special name for that little\nmolecule when you have pyruvate and you\nhave a hydrogen attached to it you know\nwhat it's called\nuh hydrogen peroxide lactate\nlactate lactic acid this is that whole\nsystem right again I'm skipping some\nsteps making a little bit of mistakes\nhere intentionally folks just to make\nthis assumed so what happens when you\nstart running a bunch of anaerobic\nglycolysis you start seeing massive\nrises in\nlactate\ncool not lactic acid right right\nthat's why we see associations between a\nlot of lactate and a lot of fatigue but\nthe lactate is actually not causing the\nfatigue the lactate is actually sparing\nyou from having a bunch of free-floating\nacid\nit's also can be then used directly back\nin the muscle because as soon as you\nbring in enough oxygen\nand you can take that hydrogen back off\nof it you've now turned it right back\ninto pyruvate you can run it through\nthis whole cycle as fuel that I'm about\nto do you can actually actually ship it\nout of the exercising muscle and ship it\ninto a non-exercising muscle and then go\nbackwards and make glucose what actually\nliberates hydrogen from from lactate\nwell you like chemically yeah so what\nwhat liberates uh what well what are the\nstimuli that can take hydrogen off the\npyruvate yeah oh yeah and and then in\nother words to reduce lactate and free\nup that hydrogen oxygen availability\nso in fact one of the major places that\nyou ship hydrogen to or one of the major\nplaces that you ship likely to is your\nheart\nbecause it's what we call like the\nultimate slow touch fiber and it is has\na ton of freely available mitochondria\nwhich have a ton of access to oxygen so\nit can actually then go to it form water\nthe H2O can be used to form water and\nnow we have a place to store the\nhydrogen\ngot it right\ncool so\nas a result of anaerobic glycolysis\nwe have made a little bit of ATP we've\ncreated a lot of waste and we don't have\nanywhere to to go with these end\nproducts\nso when you do anything of a higher\nintensity and it says I need energy fast\nyou're going to go to this system first\nright right past ATP because it is the\nfastest place to get energy but you're\nnot going to get much of it and you've\ngot to deal with the waste products\nboom\nright back to the beginning of our\nconversation endurance is about two\nthings energy production and waste\nmanagement and we're right we're fatigue\nbuffering this is it right how well can\nyou handle the elevations in hydrogen\nright drop in PH and how and then what\nare you going to do with these products\nif you want to fully metabolize a\ncarbohydrate you then have to take some\ndo something with those pyruvates or\nthose acetyl coase what you're going to\ndo if oxygen is available you will take\nthose things and ship them into the\nmitochondria\nthey have to go through some cell walls\nand some other things like that but\nthey're going to get inside there\nonce they're in there that two carbon\nacetyl-coa runs through this entire\ncycle that we call the Krebs cycle\nthat's this really interesting place\nthat's where B6 and nmn people are like\nthat's where that whole stuff starts to\nkick in all your B vitamins basically\nrun that entire circle and you're going\nto start off the top you have a bunch of\nfun stuff going on but as a part of that\nCircle you're going to pull off some\nsome of the hydrogen ions you're going\nto send these to What's called the\nelectron transport chain that's where\nyou're going to get a ton of ATP out of\nand as a result about halfway through\nthe turn you're going to pull off one\ncarbon and about halfway through the\nother almost the other way to the Finish\nyou're going to pull off the second\ncarbon so you're going to take the\nsecond acetyl-coa run that entire thing\nsame through as well and so what we did\nis we started off with a six carbon\nglucose chain we split it in half we\ncall those pyruvate made a little bit of\nenergy because we broke that one Bond of\nthose two carbons that are in the middle\ncool those two three carbon molecules we\npulled one carbon off of each we brought\nin sorry we moved those into the\nmitochondria we brought one off we took\na breath brought in some oxygen bonded\nthat Brett took out two CO2 exhales we\nran the acetyl-coa through the Krebs\ncycle one two carbons per turn coming\nout of CO2 so we had six carbons total\nas we started and we exited with zero\ncarbons now we have fully metabolized a\nmolecule of carbohydrate\nthat required an anaerobic start and an\naerobic finish\nif you don't have a lot of mitochondria\nlarge mitochondria high functioning\nmitochondria you're going to limit your\nanaerobic performance because you're\ngoing to get they're going to run that\ndoor full very very quickly you can't go\npast it because hydrogen will build up\nway too fast and one of the things that\nwe know is both temperature and pH\nrun enzyme function so they're going to\nstop you won't even be able to run\nthrough in fact that ATP hydrolysis\nphase even if I gave you a whole\ninfinite supply of ATP if I put enough\nacid in there it would stop working\nbecause the ATP Ace enzyme needed to\nsplit it won't be able to run in a\nhighly acidic environment or a hot\nenvironment yeah at some point perhaps\ntoday perhaps in a future discussion\nbut still not too far from now we could\ntalk about the role of temperature uh in\nthe uh in pyruvate from in terms of its\nregulation muscle contraction but I want\nto make sure I understood something\ncorrectly you mentioned these these uh\ntwo parallel fuel systems right one is\nessentially anaerobic right and the\nother is aerobic you said that if we\ncan't pull enough\num if we can't break enough bonds then\nwe limit our anaerobic capacity correct\nI would have thought given that uh the\nmitochondria or the site for essentially\nfor aerobic metabolism that we would be\nlimiting our aerobic capacity as well\num perhaps you could just clarify for me\nhow these two things are divided or is\nthere not a clean division is it not an\neither No in fact again I think it's\nbetter to think of these things rather\nas two separate parallel things as one\nbig cycle they're one gear turning the\nnext being compromised in one will\ncompromise the other that I should say\nreminds me of what you said earlier\nwhich is this the bicycle gear analogy\nthat works uh great so if you if you\nshort circuit one basically that the\nchain can't move that's yeah fantastic\nokay so um so indeed they they are\nrunning in parallel but they are\num interdependent yeah well they're\nactually not even running in parallel\nbecause they're actually funneling to\nthe same endpoint\nright which is like if you're going to\ncome from the anaerobic glycolysis route\nor you're going to come from the fat\nroute which I'll talk about in a second\nthey're both going to be limited in the\nmitochondria\nso when that thing's full it doesn't\nmatter you can't run either system\nright so it is more of like a again if\nyou're running the bike gears it doesn't\nreally matter if the back one's larger\nor smaller because if either one is\nlimited your toast because they're\nrunning on the same system\nyou can you can you can sneak a little\nbit here and there but but not much\nyou also really nicely highlighted how\nlactate this thing that we think of as a\na limiting factor like the burn it gets\nin the way and it's the thing we need to\nstop and buffer and all all sorts of\nthings sure it's actually really a fuel\nit's a tremendously effective fuel it is\na strongly preferred fuel actually the\nis this interesting this is a very\nclassic case of Association\num correlation versus causation right so\nthe original actually like there's a\nreally cool history on lactate but it\nwas originally found uh I think in\nGermany\num part of my history there\num somewhere in Europe in hunted Stags\nso one of the things is they sort of\nrealized is like if we if we if we\nharvested a stag in a rest estate when\nit didn't know we were there versus if\nwe chased it and it was ran down that\nthese lactate concentrations were\nsignificantly higher in in the latter\nsituation therefore lactate started\nimmediately getting this association\nbetween High fatigue points and it is\neasy to measure if you were to do any\nsort of lactate test any sort of\nmetabolic test you will see as fatigue\nincreases lactate will also increase the\nAssumption there was then oh my gosh\nis the cause now we know like again it's\nnot the thing it's in large part trying\nto buffer\nthe negative consequences of ATP\nhydrolysis and and some other things so\nit is certainly playing a part in that\nrole but it is not the core driver it's\nalso why you don't need to worry about\ndoing things to quote unquote\num\nreduce lactate in the muscle after\nexercise or to clear lactate or any of\nthose things you may still want to do\nthose activities but not for that reason\nlactate's fine you're actually going to\nuse it in again the neighboring exercise\nmuscle fibers in the same muscle another\nmuscle you can send it actually to the\nto the liver and it can actually go\nthrough gluconeogenesis and it can\nactually replenish liver glycogen just\ndoes that feel sore sorry you sound\nharder any number of sources you can\nalso just kind of put it in circulation\nput a back in the muscle and once enough\noxygen is there you can just kick it\nright back into either glucose or\nglycogen it's totally fine so\nit is obviously clear though once that\nnumber gets very very high other things\nare going to be happening they're going\nto be causing a lot of hurt and this is\nyour managing waste right it is really\nan issue of managing what am I going to\ndo with all this extra carbon what am I\ngoing to do with all this extra\ninorganic phosphate and some other nasty\nbyproducts but that's the thing you have\nto deal with\nI'd love for you to teach me how\ndifferent ratios of fuel sources are\nused depending on how long I happen to\nbe exercising\nfor example if I do a very short bout of\nexercise yep typically that's correlated\nwith a higher intensity output I mean I\nsuppose I could jog for one minute but\nhere I'm thinking about sprinting for\none minute or less\nwhich fuels are used is that mainly\ndriven by fat stores by carbohydrate\nstores is it driven by dietary fat\npreferentially or carbohydrate that I've\ningested if indeed I've ingested those\nor protein for that matter\nand then as we transition to exercise\nthat goes a little bit longer you know\nanywhere from you know three to five\nminutes how do those ratios change and\nas we transition to longer duration what\nmost people think of as endurance\nexercise but long duration output of you\nknow 20 minutes or more\nleading all the way up to a full\nMarathon how does that change the ratio\nof fuel sources that are used and I'd be\nparticularly interested in\ndistinguishing between\ncarbohydrate fat and protein that's\ningested so coming from food sources or\ncarbohydrate fat and protein that are\ncoming from Storage sites within the\nbody okay great let's start at zero\nseconds and run all the way through\nMarathon\nand we'll we'll flag the distinctions\nwhere they start changing as soon as you\nwant to create muscle contraction and\npower the very first source of energy is\nphosphoid creatine that's going to power\nyou for zero to maybe say eight to\nFifteen twenty seconds of maximal\nexertion and that's in coming from the\nmuscle fibers themselves yeah that is\nactually stored in the What's called the\ncytoplasm so this is a little area of\nspace in the muscle fiber that's sort of\nlike in this jelly-like substance and\nit's nice because one molecule of\nphosphoid creatine gives you one\nmolecule of ATP so it's not a big energy\noutput but it's very fast because it is\nstored right there in the local\nexercising muscle right now if you need\nenergy past that point say you know 10\nor 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of\nminutes this is now you're going to have\nto transition because you're going to\nburn through that phospho-creatine it's\ngoing to be out\nyou're going to have to move to now\ncarbohydrate metabolism this is what we\ncall anaerobic glycolysis so there's two\nphases of glycolysis now glycolysis\nitself means glucose burning all right\nso this means we're using carbohydrate\nas a fuel source so initially when we\nstart off this Cascade\nwhich is going to take us again for a\ncouple of minutes\ncarbohydrate utilization comes first\nfrom the exercising muscle so it's very\nsimilar to phosphocreatine that way\nif you start running low on it you can\nactually start pulling blood glucose and\nif blood glucose gets low you'll have to\nstart getting glycogen from the liver to\nkeep that up and we've sort of covered\nthat conversation all right so a little\nbit of chemistry here just give me a\nlittle bit of room here so now remember\na carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that\nhas been hydrated so one carbon attached\nto one water and remember water is H2O\nmost of the time when we're talking\nabout glucose it is in the six carbon\nchain so six carbons attached to six\nwater molecules all right great when I\ngo to split this up through anaerobic\nglycolysis it works a little bit like\nthis so you've got this six carbon chain\nthe first step is to snap that thing in\nhalf you're going to make two three\ncarbon chains now we broke one Bond\nright there so we got a little bit of\nenergy but not a tremendous amount at\nthe end of anaerobic glycolysis you're\ngoing to net something like three or\nfour ATP so more than you get from the\nphosphate quadruple\nbut still not very much there's another\nmajor downside that's coming in a second\nto this system the upside is it's fast\nnow what actually one adaptation we get\nto training in this style\nis you'll increase your ability to store\nglycogen in your muscle\nwhich is great right we can actually\nbiopsy you and measure the amount that\nyou store in a training adaptation is\nawesome so you're able to sustain this\nsystem longer so perhaps 90 seconds into\nyour interval training you hit a fatigue\npoint and now you maybe can extend that\nto 100 or 115 seconds simply because\nyou're storing more glycogen in the\nmuscle\nbefore we have to and then go into the\nblood and get up in the form of glucose\nso that's great so we've got this six\ncarbon molecule and we split this in\nhalf we got that little bit of ATP and\nnow we're in this little tricky position\nbecause this three carbon molecule is\nwhat we call pyruvate pyruvic acid and\nagain chemistry folks I'm skipping some\nsteps I'm going to intentionally make\nsome mistakes here I'm making sure the\nentire world listening regardless of\nwhere they come in can follow me here\nokay so don't burn me on the details\nright you've got this pyruvate the\nproblem is you can no longer do anything\nwith that glycolysis is over you've got\nto make a choice\nright in order to make something out of\nthose three carbon molecules you've got\nto ship them to the mitochondria as we\nsaid that is the only place of aerobic\nmetabolism\nright we cannot do aerobic metabolism\nanywhere else until we enter the\nmitochondria so anytime we cross that\nbarrier we know we've automatically\nswitched from anaerobic to aerobic well\nhere's the problem\nif you were to take one more carbon off\nthat three carbon pyruvate you have to\nnow do something with that carbon waste\nokay so before when we split the six\ncarbon chain we didn't actually leave\nany carbons free floating we just split\na two molecule in half\nwhen we go to split from pyruvate and\nmake it into this two carbon molecule\ncalled acetyl-coa or seal COA now we've\ngot a free-floating carbon\nwe have to have a strategy for that\nbecause that's going to increase the\nacidity level any enzyme in our body\nthat works to create fuel\nis very pH sensitive right so if this\nthing if pH gets off either high or low\nthese enzymes can't work and that's\nreally really important because even if\nI were to give you a direct injection of\nATP remember that's that energy currency\nthat's the only way we can actually form\nenergy I guess remember to clarify\nanytime we're using phosphoid creatine\nor glucose or fat which we'll get to a\nsecond we're not actually getting energy\nfor exercise by breaking those down or\ngetting energy that we can use to then\nmake ATP we break that ATP down that's\nwhat's actually powering muscle\ncontraction\num you can go back to our previous\nepisode where we'll walk you through the\ndetail of the muscle contraction but\nthat's what we're after okay\nso in the case of pyruvate if we split\nthat off we have got to deal with that\nand the only way in the best way we can\ndeal with that is oxygen remember we're\ngoing to breathe in O2 that O2 is going\nto combine with that free-floating\ncarbon makes CO2 we're going to Exhale\nthat thing out that's our Waste\nManagement strategy\nbut\nthat has to happen in the mitochondria\nremember if we're using oxygen it has to\nbe in the mitochondria so if we have the\nability to ship pyruvate into the\nmitochondria\nor golden\nbut what happens if we don't\nwhy do we not well if we don't have\nenough mitochondria or mitochondria are\ntoo small or they're too far away\nor we don't have sufficient oxygen\navailability\nwhy don't we have sufficient oxygen\navailability because we created the\npyruvate too fast\nand the demand in the mitochondria is\nexceeded by the buildup of pyruvate and\nso now we're having this giant backlog\nand this thing fills up fast\nwe have a couple of strategies here\nwell when you're going through ATP and\nyou're splitting it's called hcp\nhydrolysis\nin of doing that remember ATP is a\nadenosine molecule and then the T part\nis triphosphate one two three which\nmeans you have three phosphates attached\nto the end when you break that phosphate\noff that's where you get your energy so\nnow you have an inorganic phosphate and\nan ADP it doesn't diphosphate two\nthat process requires water it's called\nhydrolysis as a result of that you then\nhave a free floating hydrogen and as you\nwell know that is acid right that's\npotential hydrogen that's what that\nmeans and so you've increased the\nacidity in the muscle by breaking up all\nthis ATP and so oh we're building up\nacid we have building up pyruvate we\ndon't have nowhere to go with it and we\ncan't cleave off a carbon because now\nwe're just going to exacerbate\nthe acid increase\nso what we can do is we can take those\nhydrogens that we're building up and\nstore them on the pyruvate a pyruvate\nthat's holding an extra acid has a\nspecial name and we call that lactate\nall right so that's why we see this\nbuildup of lactase so one of the\ndownsides of anaerobic glycolysis is an\nincredibly High rate of waste production\nnow lactate is not the cause of fatigue\nin fact if you think a little bit more\ncarefully about what I just said it's\nactually stopping you it's what we call\na acid buffer\nyou can actually use it for a bunch of\nother things you can ship it to a\nneighboring muscle fiber in the same\nmuscle that's not working you can ship\nit to the liver you can ship it to the\nheart and a bunch of other places and\nthen you can actually just work\nbackwards so if you ship it to for\nexample the heart and it's got a bunch\nof mitochondria that are free you can\nbring in the oxygen\nattach it to that hydrogen make water\nand now you're right back to pyruvate\nyou put two pyruvate back together and\nnow you just make glucose so you can\nactually store it in the liver this is a\nprocess called gluconeogenesis through\nthis fancy thing called the Corey cycle\nwhich is what the the proper cycle here\nis\nso you can use it as a very potent fuel\nsource in fact a lactate is a\ntremendously valuable fuel source I'm\nnot like for exercise but for cognition\nand a bunch of other things so lactase\nin fact this is why um if you've seen\nthe research about\npre-exam testing exercise uh you'll see\na noticeable increase in exam scores if\nyou do a 20 minute about of exercise\nprior to taking the exam and it's\nlargely in part probably because of\nthings like elevations and lactate how\nintense of exercise uh would be most\nbeneficial I don't know that exact\nanswer I just know that generally any\nform of exercise is good but if you were\nto reach a reasonably high heart rate\nyou're probably going to see in fact\nthere's an acute and chronic adaptation\nhere so Folks at exercise have better\nmemory memory retention scores and exams\nEtc but then also doing it prior to that\nexam make sure you recovered and rested\nback down the street but you'll\ngenerally perform better previous guests\non the huberman Lab podcast who's the\nwho's a psychology professor and\nneuroscientist and also dean of College\nof Arts and Sciences at New York\nUniversity NYU Wendy Suzuki is religious\nabout\ndaily morning exercise yeah specifically\nfor this purpose of enhancing learning\nand memory and has a lot of really\nbeautiful data I consider one of the\nreal Pioneers in this space\num so if people want to learn more they\ncan look to that episode or Wendy's work\nwe can provide a link to a couple of the\npapers but\nthis is fantastic in that it's\nincredibly clear I think for the first\ntime I'm understanding what what lactate\nis really doing yeah\num and it's dispelling a lot of myths\nthat I think I and a lot of other people\narrive to the discussion about lactate\nwith\nwhat happens when the bout of exercise\nextends longer amazing so if we want to\ncontinue past that point we have to have\nsome sort of strategy to get through it\nright we're stuck we're out of gas we\nhave to then ship it to the mitochondria\nand now we're going to enter what's\ncalled aerobic glycolysis and this is\ngoing to take us anywhere from again say\nthat 90 seconds of all that work up to\nreally 20 30 minutes in fact it really\nwill take us to unlimited if you look at\na highly competitive marathon runner\neven those that are running say your two\nhour marathon those folks are burning up\nto 80 carbohydrate\nit is a it it is not a fat burning thing\nand the reason is fat metabolism is way\ntoo slow it provides a lot of energy but\nit is incredibly slow if you're trying\nto run a four and a half or so minute\nmile repeated 26 times you have to be\nmoving fast are they ingesting\ncarbohydrate as a fuel source during the\nrace\nunless you're on the team you don't know\nthey won't really tell you these are\nsort of Trade Secrets\num it would be I would say fairly rare\nto not have something right there's a\nbunch of different strategies if you're\ngoing to go really long like some of\nthese um like cycling where the races\nwill be several hours then you actually\nmight go to some fat as fuel sources I I\nknow a lot of cyclists are using ketones\nand things like that now but\ntraditionally most endurance folks are\ngoing to buy us heavily towards\ncarbohydrate\num\nnow\nin one respect\nyou're not going to run out of\ncarbohydrates\nuntil you're many hours in these folks\nare a unique case but the average\nindividual who's doing an hour hour and\na half cardio even you're not going to\nbe limited by your carbohydrate stores\nyou're going to be just fine you're\ngonna be limited by some other things\nwhich will maybe sort of break down here\nin a second\nbut you're going to be fine there a lot\nof those folks will take carbohydrate\nthey'll have very specific intervals you\nwant to you do want to be careful though\nof ingesting too many fast carbohydrates\nprior to your exercise spout um we\nactually have this little thing that's\ncalled the insulin glucose double whammy\nand what that means is when you ingest\ncarbohydrates immediately your blood\nglucose goes up and that's depending on\nthe type of carbohydrate and things like\nthat well the same thing happens with\nexercise and so what happens is insulin\nwants to start pulling glucose out of\nthe blood at the same time muscle wants\nto start pulling glucose out of the\nblood and so we have this giant bolus of\ncarbohydrate come in and then all of a\nsudden our blood sugar crashes\nand so if you're going to be doing so\nyour your first half marathon or\nsomething like that and you're in those\ngiant Corrals where there's like you\nknow 100 people waiting to go and you're\nstanding there for 45 minutes you may or\nmay not want to slug down like three or\nfour bananas in a bagel and and honey\nand things like you probably don't need\nthat now not everyone experiences this\ndouble whammy but it has been shown in\nliterature to happen to some people so\nyou want to just be a little bit careful\num an easy way to combat that is just\npractice exactly what you're going to do\nin your race in your training that's\nlike the simplest advice ever but you'd\nbe stunned how many people do things uh\nduring the race that they've actually\nnever done in training I suggest people\ndo exactly what you describe also for\nany kind of cognitive testing of course\nbefore a big exam is not the time to\ndiscover whether or not you can handle\ntwice as much espresso or take a\nnootropic for the first time or no uh or\nchange anything I mean if if indeed the\nthe score on that exam is is Meaningful\nto you you keep keep things regular so\nto recap what we've done here is we\nstarted off in the cytoplasm with this\nglucose molecule that is six carbons we\ntook that thing we split it in half we\ncall that thing anaerobic glycolysis we\nmade a little bit of energy but not much\nwe take those three carbon molecules we\nship them into the mitochondria we take\neach one of those we clear off one\ncarbon each those carbons we take a\nbreath in we attach them to oxygen we\nexhale them get rid of that energy we\nare now fully into aerobic glycolysis\neach one of those two carbon molecules\nwe run through the Krebs cycle\neach round the Krebs cycle Burns one two\ncarbons so we go one two one two and now\nwe've gone from six carbon molecule all\nthe way down to zero we used the\nhydrogens that we pulled off of that\nKrebs cycle run to go to the electron\ntransport chain from there we made a\nwhole bunch of ATP and so we have now\nfully metabolized one molecule of\ncarbohydrate and the end product of all\nof it is simply ATP water and CO2\nbeautiful\nand leads me to\nthe conclusion that most everything is\nreally about\nutilization of carbons and exhaling CO2\nis that how I should think about\nbookending what you just described this\nis why we started off the conversation\nwith the circle of life\nthis is really a carbon game this is why\nwe call Chemistry with carbon organic\nchemistry right that's what this whole\nthing is about any living being has to\nrun through metabolism\nit's all a carbon game\nany living being has to use ATP this is\nall just a big fancy game of how do I\nmake ATP and handle the waste remember\nendurance is all about Waste Management\nfatigue resistance the same thing\nand energy production we're playing a\ngame here\nthe whole game\nbring in energy use it\nmitigate waste products\nso when thinking about aerobic exercise\nor long duration exercise\nin this case anything longer than five\nminutes for that matter five minutes all\nthe way up to an ultra marathon\nthe breathing associated with endurance\nexercise the heart beating which of\ncourse is associated with the breathing\nand vice versa\nit's really all about bringing oxygen\ninto the system that then allows those\ncarbons to be used and\nwithin the mitochondria specifically and\nthen carbon dioxide to be exhaled as we\nwork through the carbons of the sort of\nbeads on a string is that right unless\nyou're moving incredibly fast for a very\nlong time and we're talking probably\nnorth of 90 minutes\nendurance is really not a game of making\nsure I have enough fuel it is simply\nmanaging the waste production\nand that's exactly what you described\nyou need to bring in the oxygen so you\ncan handle the carbon that's building up\nas a result of both the anaerobic\nanaerobic glycolysis\nthat's our game here\nif we start talking about endurance\nevents longer than that now we do have\nto start worrying about running out of\nmuscle glycogen running out of liver\nglycogen\nEtc or if we are at that two hour mark\nor so and we're moving very very very\nfast but anything south of that is just\nmanaging carbon buildup\nand we do that best through oxygen\nutilization or\ngetting more efficient having a higher\ncapacity for our anaerobic side\nso we can do that by having either more\nglycogen in our muscle\nso that lasts longer or building better\nasset buffering systems and there's a\nwhole line of supplementation that are\nspecifically acid buffers there's a\nwhole line of training there's a whole\nline of breathing to manage this that so\nwe have a lot of strategies where we can\nmaximize endurance all we have to do\nis go back to the earlier part of our\ntalk which is figure out what's the\nactual limiting step\nand then train according to that or do\nyour strategy your nutrition your\nsupplementation that defeats that\nlimiting factor for an example if you're\ntrying to maximize your performance in\nthis 20 second maximal burst and your\nstrategy for that was to make sure your\nmuscle glycogen is saturated\nit's probably not going to help a ton\nbecause you're not going to be limited\nby total fuel you're going to be limited\nby your ability to buffer acid however\nstoring more glycogen in your muscle in\npreparation for a marathon is a\ntremendously effective strategy because\nthat will become a limiting factor so\nwhat we can do actually next if you'd\nlike is we can just walk through these\nand look at the individual limitations\nwhere the failure Point happens and that\neffectively will outline your strategy\nfor improving them so you taught us\nabout carbohydrate utilization as a fuel\nsource\nwhat about fat and what about protein\ngreat I'll start with protein because\nit's easy it is\ngenerally at best going to represent 10\npercent\nof your energy output now that will grow\nover time in terms of if you did a\nseveral hour lot of exercise when you\nstarted doing it you might be using five\npercent of your energy from protein and\nthen in that micro to 10 or so and that\nhappens because you start running low on\nmuscle glycogen you start running low on\nliver glycogen\nyou start then having to pull in energy\nfrom another place so like as those\nnumbers go down you'll see an increased\nuptick of energy from fat as well as\nprotein having said that it's not a\ntremendous fuel source it is only\naerobic so it has to be oxidized those\nare the same thing when I say oxidized\nyou use oxygen to burn something to make\na fuel\num so it's not a significant contributor\nto energy in that regard and unless\nyou're talking ultramarathons are longer\nand it is also not something that can\nenhance performance and so we don't\nreally need to talk much more about it\nthan that in terms of fat as a fuel\nsource now here's the fundamental\ndifference while carbohydrate starts\nanaerobically and finishes aerobically\nin the mitochondria you're using mostly\nthe carbohydrate in the exercising\nmuscle tissue\neventually you can pull from blood and\nthen you can pull from the liver with\nfat you have a tiny amount stored in the\nmuscle intramuscular triglycerides but\nthe overwhelming majority of fuel you\nget from fat comes systemically\nand so now we have a fundamental\ndifference we actually literally have a\nTime problem I can get energy from\ncarbohydrates faster because it is\ndirectly there if I go to pull it from\nfat I've got to pull it from the rest of\nthe body which is why somebody who loses\nfat loses it from their entire body\ndespite the fact that they may be only\nexercising a couple of parts so think\nabout a runner someone who lost a lot of\nfat or running you don't see them just\nlose fat in their legs it comes from\ntheir face and their neck and everywhere\nwhy because what you're going to do is\npull fat from the entire system you're\ngoing to break it down through a process\ncalled lipolysis\nwhich means you break it down from the\nstored form you put it in the blood as\nthat glycerol backbone which is that\nthree carbon backbone\nin the individual fatty acids it's going\nto float through the blood there's a\nseven step system here but we'll skip it\nfor now it's going to have to get then\nuptaken into the muscle in the muscle\nthen it has to get taken up and run into\nthe mitochondria now\nthat backbone that three carbon glycerol\nbackbone is actually going to function\nalmost exactly like the three carbon\npyruvate just get it into the\nmitochondria cleave off one carbon run\nit as acetylch\nexact same thing super easy to\nmetabolize small enough to go through\nthe mitochondrial membrane the fatty\nacid chains become a problem\nso if you have a chain that's longer\nthan or eight or so carbons\nit has to actually go through a special\ntransporter on the cell wall to get in\nand that's going to be limited by a\nthing called carnitine\nand you're probably familiar with that\nas a supplement you may have talked\nabout it there's a lot of places that\nmake it that's going to be a limiting\nfactor if it is a smaller what we call a\nshort chain or even a medium chain\ntriglyceride which a lot of folks have\nheard of MCT that's what we're talking\nabout that can actually go directly\nthrough because it's small enough to\npass through and you can use it\nimmediately as an energy source in\neither case the way that you finally\nmetabolize a fatty acid is a process\nwhere you would go through and cut off\ntwo carbons\nat a time why would you cut off too\nbecause you're trying to make that two\ncarbon acetyl COA so you can run through\nthat Krebs cycle again\nbecause you're cutting off two carbons\nat a time we have a special name for\nthat oxidation process it's called beta\noxidation that's exactly why we call it\nbeta oxidation\ntwo carbons in you cut it off to make\nthat acetalkoa so you can notice the\noxidation pathway the electron transport\npathway is identical whether you're\ntalking about the carbohydrates or the\nfat in fact it doesn't even matter\nmore to our point if we're talking about\nsimply fat loss it really just is about\nrunning that electron transport chain\nwhether it came from a carbohydrate or\noriginal Source or a fat original Source\nit ends up in the mitochondria as\nbasically the exact same thing it then\nends the end of metabolism as the same\nthing remember the final endpoint\nof carbohydrate metabolism is water ATP\nand CO2 do you want to guess the final\nendpoint of fat metabolism\nwater\nATP and CO2\nso\npractical applications here\nif you want to maximize fat loss what\ntype of training is best\nit really doesn't matter\nif you enjoy longer steady state stuff\nfantastic if you enjoy intervals amazing\nif you would like to do a combination\nthat's my personal preference that's\ngreat too you have a ton of options pick\nwhat you think is a combination of\nchallenging\nnot all exercise should be easy but you\nwill actually enjoy someone or you're\nwilling to accept\nand anything that you absolutely hate\ndon't do it sometimes is very very very\ndifficult to do high intensity training\nyou have to really be interested in\ndoing it if not it ends up turning into\nlike moderate intensity training you\nsort of just check the box and it\ndoesn't work that well if you're just\nchecking the box so if you're like man\nmentally I don't have it in me today to\nget to a high heart rate and throw up\nand all that stuff cool but you can just\ndo some moderate steady state stuff well\nthat's a win great if you're like oh my\ngosh more than 10 straight minutes and\nI'm so bored and you're all maybe you're\nalso like I don't have 45 minutes I got\nto get this done in eight minutes great\ngo do some high intense intervals either\noption will be equally effective\nas you mentioned earlier\nexercise is useful for aesthetic changes\nfunctionality\nand for longevity\nbut when thinking about exercise\nspecifically for fat loss\nI do have to ask this question\nI often hear from people that they\nprefer one type of exercise versus\nanother\nfor sake of fat loss because certain\nforms of exercise make them very hungry\nI'm wondering whether or not there's any\nrelationship between the intensity or\ntype of exercise and the hunger stimulus\nnow I don't have this problem because\nbasically everything makes me hungry\num and yet I'm also okay fasting for\npart of the day yeah I'm one of those\npseudo-intermittent fasters\ntalk about what I mean by that I just\nhappen to eat between 11 A.M and 8 PM\nnaturally I'm not religious about it but\num but I don't do it for any other\nreason except that that tends to be when\nI'm hungry and I exercise outside of\nthat\num in the morning typically\nin any case\nis there a way that people can determine\nwhat type of exercise might be better or\nworse for them based on its appetite\nstimulating or inhibiting effects\nbecause I also hear that you know some\npeople will go for a long run and then\nthey are quote unquote not hungry for\nseveral hours afterwards does that have\nanything to do with which fuels are\nbeing utilized during different forms of\nexercise that's actually a really good\nquestion I don't know the the mechanisms\nthat can explain that answer what I can\ntell you is you hear the same comment\nfor physical activity in other words\npeople say\nman if I do this type of training then I\njust am exhausted and I lay around the\nrest of the day so my total caloric\nexpenditure is actually compromised as\nan aggregate because I'm down um the\ndata would suggest in general that\ndoesn't happen\nso most of the time we don't see a\nreduction in physical activity\num with either high intensity or steady\nstate training in fact you generally see\nequal if not increased what's called\nneed so it's the non-exercising part of\nyour day\nin addition to the basal metabolic rate\nso physical activity wise you don't send\nto be prop now hunger is a little bit of\na different thing\nthe answer here is I don't think we have\ntime to actually do justice on this so\nperhaps best to not get into this one\nyeah why don't we punt this down the\nroad to our discussion about nutrition\nspecifically and and weave back to it so\nwe'll earmark it for that\num meanwhile it sounds like if one is\nthinking purely in terms of uh\nburning calories yep and getting the\nhealth benefits of exercise to create a\ncaloric deficit to create fat loss it\ndoesn't matter whether or not they burn\nthose calories using a form of exercise\nthat relies predominantly on\ncarbohydrate fat or protein correct it's\nnot that it doesn't matter it's that\neither one will work\nbecause when we say things like that\nit's it doesn't mean they're actually\nidentical\nthere are some slight differences and\nmaybe those differences are important\nfor some people and not others\nought to say is either one is a viable\nstrategy\ngreat what about protein as a fuel\nas an actual feel so here let me give\nyou an analogy\nimagine that you are you were with me a\nfew weeks ago in southern Montana and\nwe're out\num in the wilderness for a week okay and\nit's cold out there and you needed to\nmake a fire\nuh and if I said look you can pick any\nof these things there are so there's\nsome wood over there we brought some\nnewspaper and then we brought a match\nand we need to create a fire we're gonna\nuse that fire to energy and heat up\nokay I said great the very first place\nyou would probably start to make that\nfire is the match you like the match in\nany match hey it's going to light\nimmediately but it's probably going to\nlast 5 to 20 seconds I don't know before\nit burns out that's fossil creatine\nreal fast real Burns Out\nif you were smart you would take that\nmatch and then light the newspaper on\nfire right now if you were to burn a\nwhole newspaper it is more energy\nthen you get to the match but you still\nyou know I don't know what's going to\ntake a few minutes some number of\nminutes before an entire 65 burns up\nfive I don't know right depends on then\nyeah which type of newspaper it is I\nguess right amazing\nthat's carbohydrate\nright if you were really smart you would\nuse that to then light a piece of wood\non fire and a wood if you've been in the\nwilderness it could last hours days it's\nreally quite unlimited your phospho\ncreatine storage is very limited small\nglycogen is a lot higher because you can\nstore it in muscle you can store it in\nother places so you have more but not a\nlot fat is unlimited the average person\nif you're around say 70 kilos up 170\npounds or so and you're moderately lean\nmaybe 15 body fat nothing crazy you\nprobably have enough stored fat\nto create enough energy to survive for\nmore than 30 days\nright this would literally be if you\ningested zero calories you have enough\nfuel in your stored fat to keep you\nalive for certainly 30 days\nyou wouldn't feel good and all those\nthings but energetically basically fat\nwill never\never be your limiting factor to\nPerformance\nso when we start talking about well what\nlimits my performance in these areas you\ncan just wipe fat off the list it will\nnever be your limiting factor to any\ntype of endurance performance you simply\nhave way too much the only problem with\nfat is is just too slow I've got to\nmobilize it I've got to get in the blood\nmove it that whole thing too slow so if\nI want to go faster I will never be able\nto fully utilize fat which is why we\ntalked about earlier you'll never see a\nsituation in which somebody is a hundred\npercent burning fat as a fuel and no\npercent carbohydrate it's always going\nto be too slow\nhighest you'll get maybe 70 so percent\nprotein in this equation\nis none of that now you may notice\nhow do you make paper what's fibrous you\ncombine with water that you it gets\npressed it gets compressed yeah yeah\nit's made from wood\nhow do you make a match\nit's made from wood\nwhat's carbohydrate a chain of carbon\nwhat's fat a chain of carbon these are\nsimilar molecules right they're meant to\ngive you pros and cons it's very\ndifficult to just light a log on fire\nwithout a lot of work you'd have to burn\nburn burn burn burn so these are\ncomplementary systems that are really\nclose to the same thing protein\nis none of those things protein is more\nlike a piece of metal\nso if you were out in the woods with me\nand we were trying to make a fire and\nyou're like hey look I found some old\nuh\nrailroad over there let's throw that on\nthere I would probably look at you like\ncrazy now technically can you melt metal\nsure but you're gonna burn a lot of\nenergy to try to get a little bit back\nout of the metal and now you've also\ncost yourself a very very valuable\nstructure\nso protein is a fuel source for exercise\nor metabolism it's just an incredibly\npoor choice your body will do it again\nmaybe five to ten percent but you now\nyou're burning a very valuable Supply in\na situation in which you don't know\nwhere there's ever going to be anymore\nremember protein is fairly transient\nit's you're not very good at storing it\nyou can store a ton of carbohydrate and\nan unlimited literally amount of fat so\nyou just really need to disregard\nthinking about protein as a fuel source\nyour body does not want to do it you're\nnot good at it you can go through a\nprocess of gluconeogenesis from protein\nmake glucose from it is just very poor\nyou're not going to get much out of the\nexchange and you've burned your supply\nof metal which is going to be very\ndifficult it's a very high commodity in\nthe woods or the Wilderness to have\nsomething like metal for people that\nconsume very low carbohydrate or zero\ncarbohydrate diets are they pulling more\nenergy from muscle so which I imagine is\na conversion of amino acids into ready\ncarbon chains yeah I mean in this\nparticular case once you've reached um\na certain level of adaptation you've\njust gotten extremely good at generating\nglucose from other Fashions right so you\ncan bias heavily towards fat adaptation\nthe downside is and we've seen this born\nin literature you're going to perform\nslower\nso if you don't care about maximizing\nperformance especially over something\nwhere it is a maximal effort for a few\nminutes or something then maybe you're\nnot concerned and that's absolutely\ngreat especially for people just don't\nexercise\nthen hey geez very little concern here\nbut if you're interested in your\nperformance and you're wondering why\nyou're just like slugging it down well\nwhat you've done is you've down\nregulated the ability literally the\nenzymes responsible for that entire\nanaerobic glycolysis portion they get\ndown regulated which means there's not\nas much around anymore and so you get\nreally bad and slow at using\ncarbohydrates as a fuel source so it's a\nvery poor strategy for people on an\nanaerobic based sport or who like that\ntype of activity again if you don't care\nno problem if you don't exercise at all\nthen you really have no problem there\nwhich is actually why\na high fat low carbohydrate nutrition\nstrategy for people who don't do much\nphysical activity is probably like very\nwell it's very effective it is a really\ngood strategy for weight management for\nenergy stabilization throughout the day\nand the research would very much support\nthat in my observation I would agree\nI've tried low carbohydrate diets of\nseverely limiting or completely\neliminating carbohydrate and\nafter about two or three days I feel\npretty lousy but mostly because I want\nto train very intensely in the gym in\naddition to doing longer runs I tend to\ndo all of those things across the week\nyeah but I've also observed and in fact\nknow several people that love the very\nlow carbohydrate AKA ketogenic type diet\nthey're not doing ketogenic diets for\nmental health reasons per se but indeed\nthose people tend to do very limited\nexercise or they tend to do a lot of\nlong endurance but low intensity long\nendurance these are the I walk to get my\nexercise types and they do indeed walk a\nlot and some of them manage to control\ntheir weight very readily and like that\ndiet for that reason\num when we had Lane Norton on the\npodcast he pointed out quite aptly that\nin order to lose weight you have to\nrestrict something either of course time\nor macronutrients Etc to arrive at that\nsub caloric threshold get below the the\nsub maintenance threshold I guess one of\nthe things I want to point out is\nthis should be received as again not a\nthis is better or worse this is just you\nnow have a ton of options\nso whatever personal preference other\nfactors you get to craft this strategy\nof performance Aesthetics and health\nbased on your personal preferences\nat this point I'd like to go back to our\nclassic list of nine adaptations that\nexercise can induce\nthe first four of course being largely\nlargely unrelated to today's\nconversation but that we're covered in\nthe episode\nthat we did on strength speed and\nhypertrophy so just to remind people the\nnine adaptations are number one skill\nand technique two speed three power\nwhich is speed times Force four strength\nand five hypertrophy today we're talking\nabout the remaining adaptations on that\nlist starting with muscular endurance\nfollowed by anaerobic capacity\nfollowed by maximal aerobic output and\nfinishing at number nine with long\nduration exercise so\nif we could start with muscular\nendurance this would be number six on\nthe list of nine adaptations\nmuscular endurance\nhow do I build muscular endurance why\nshould I build muscular endurance and\njust to remind me what fuel sources\nare predominating when I'm training for\nmuscular endurance great so remember\nmuscular endurance is something that's\ngoing to be generally in a local muscle\nit is not a cardiovascular or systemic\nissue and it tends to be something in\nthe neighborhood of say five to maybe\neven up to 50 repetitions so this is the\nclassic example we'll give here is how\nmany push-ups can you do in a row most\npeople are going to land somewhere in\nthat range I just said how many sit-ups\ncan you do in a minute how many pull-ups\nhow long can you hang on a bar\num as a dead hang things like that\nthat's muscular endurance muscular\nendurance is not a mild run or a\nmarathon or anything like that so uh how\nlong can I stand without breaking\nposture\nthis is muscular endurance a plank a\nwall sit great yes love all these things\nokay now the reason I took you on that\nbig long metabolism Journey is so I\ncould help you understand exactly how to\ntrain\nthis Factor any of these factors\nwith a more comprehensive understanding\nof what's Happening meaning thinking\nback to metabolism\nif I'm going to ask my triceps to do 50\npush-ups in a row\nwhat's going to be my limiting factor am\nI going to run out of fat\nno chance am I going to run out of\nglycogen no chance that's way too few of\nrepetitions you have a lot left there so\nwhat's going to be the thing that stops\nme from getting 51 repetitions either\nyou're going to have too high\nof a pH rise so too much acid build up\nor you're going to have a problem\nclearing the waste\nso really this is two factors dealing\nwith acid buildup and getting acid out\nof the muscle tissue and end of\ncirculation because you have plenty of\nability to handle that small amount of\nacid buildup in your entire body it's\njust you can't handle it in that tiny\nspot now I picked the tricep for a very\nspecific reason\nyou're gonna deal with more pain when\nyou use a large muscle group like your\nquads or your glutes than you are with a\nsmall muscle group for example nobody\never threw up after arm day\nbut a lot of people throw up after leg\nday why is that look at the total amount\nof waste that you're dumping into your\nsystem when you have quadrupled or 10x\nthe muscle size small muscle groups are\nonly really going to be challenged in\nthat local area large ones will dump so\nmuch waste into the system that you'll\nwant to avoid that as quickly as\npossible and that's one of the reasons\nwhy you throw up\nafter Hard Exercise great so\nthe reason I'm laughing because I don't\nthink I've ever thrown up uh from a\nweight training session and so it's\nmaking me wonder if I've ever trained\nthat hard I've received uh or obtained\nthe progress that I've wanted to do\ngenerally over time not every week every\nworkout every month but certainly over\nthe 30 plus years that I've been weight\ntraining I've achieved the results I've\nwanted I have however\nvomited after a long run\nwhen I didn't hydrate well oh or if I\ndrink too much water sure oh sure too\nmuch water yeah you'll you'll get that\nout quick right I just uh want to be\nclear because I think some people are\ngetting the picture that if they're not\nvomiting then after their leg workout\nthat they're not training according to\nuh your standards Again by the way um Dr\nAndy Galvin runs experiments in his lab\nhe's recruiting subjects\n[Laughter]\nalso known as my graduate students\nthat's right in any event sorry to\ninterrupt uh but I felt it was the\nnecessary Interruption so muscular\nendurance\nthere's plenty of fuel plenty of fuel\nyou manage acid buildup and you also\nneed to get that fuel out of you that's\ngoing to be a capitalization issue so\nthe way that we can think about this is\ncapillaries surround your muscle and the\nwhole point of them is so that blood can\ncome into them they hit this\ncapitalization that actually slows the\ndiffusion rate of blood down and so you\ncan exchange nutrients in and get waste\nproducts out and then we get things back\ninto circulation so the more of those\nyou have the better you are at\ndispersing any of these waste products\nbuild up whether it's CO2 or the acid so\nthe adaptation you're looking for here\nis an increase in capitalization\npotentially a slight increase in\nmitochondria but the time is too fast\nright so we're going to be able to need\nto do these 50 repetitions and say under\na minute or something like that so\ngetting the mobilization into the\nmitochondria getting fuel that way too\nslow it's not really going to get our\nperformance here so what are strategies\nto increase\nacid buffering ability and then\ncapitalization\nso on the capitalization side you simply\nneed to train\nat that ability so you go close to\nfailure and practice that often that\nalone will increase increase blood flow\nto that local area which will take you\nthrough your process of increasing\ncapitalization easy peasy specificity\njust to briefly interrupt\nI find it remarkable although not\nsurprising giving how amazing the human\nbody is that simply by doing some\nmovement repeat like a wall set or a uh\nor push-ups or dips for that matter\nrepeatedly over and over and over until\nyou reach that failure Point yep or that\nquaking point in the case of a wall set\nthat provides a stimulus for more\ncapillaries to be built into the system\nliterally the the production or the\num the trafficking of endothelial cells\nwhich make up the capillaries and allow\nbasically more little pipes to feed the\nsystem with oxygen and remove waste\nproducts it's like irrigation right\nimagine you had a giant field and you\nhad two big pipes running down the\noutside well in fact if you want to make\nsure water gets evenly dispersed across\nthe entire field you'll have a bunch of\noffshooting little pipes and the more\nthose you have the more coverage you get\ndo we know what the specific signal is\nthat says hey\nI failed at this we need more\ncapillaries I actually don't know what\nthat is I could I would speculate It's a\ncombination of\num acidity as well as carbon dioxide and\nprobably some nitric oxide stuff\nhappening there but I actually don't\nknow I'm guessing nobody knows for sure\nbecause we still don't know for instance\nwhat the exact signal is for hypertrophy\nit's kind of an amazing situation we\nknow the requirements for getting the\nresults that we want yeah but we still\ndon't know what the specific signal is\num in any event what I'm hearing is\nbuilding more capillaries is great for\nenhancing muscular endurance and the way\nto get more capillaries into those\nmuscles is to train for muscular\nendurance\nby getting\nclose to failure or to some point where\nyou simply can't continue for whatever\nreason could you give us an example of\nwhat a reasonable training protocol\nmight be in terms of\nthe classic Galpin lists now exercise\nChoice maybe a few options order\nvolume and frequency great what should\nwe be doing how often should we be doing\nit and you know for instance should I do\nwall sets to failures and push-ups to\nfailure given that this is a local\nprocess I'm guessing that if I do\npush-ups to failure I'm not going to\nincrease the number of capillaries in my\nlegs very much correct\nso you nailed it exercise choice is high\nPrecision here so pick the muscle group\nand the exact sequencing and movement\npattern you want High Precision this is\nthe thing if you want to get better at\napplying hold the plank you're going to\ndo more push-ups two more push-ups you\ncan do some other stuff that's\ncomplementary but really this is a high\nPrecision game do the exact same thing\nfor exercise Choice very simple there\nokay in terms of exercise order I\nsuppose this dovetails with volume yeah\ncan I combine\num training let's say wall sets for my\nquads and real you know nearby muscle\ngroups and then do push-ups to failure\nuh and then also do some sort of um\npulling exercise to failure yep\nabsolutely again pick the exercises you\nwant the movement patterns you want to\ndo and do them the order almost doesn't\nmatter with the one caveat with larger\nmuscle groups particularly again\nmultiple leg activities that will induce\na small amount of systemic fatigue and\nso if you I guess theoretically wanted\nto maximize your push-up number\nand you did a whole bunch of say split\nsquats\nand you just did those and and you you\nknow did lunges for a mile or something\nlike that you might actually slightly\ncompromise you might not but you might\nslightly compromise your ability to do\nas many pull-ups in a row or hold a bend\nover row or something like that so if\nyou really cared about that level then\nyou maybe want to do the one thing\nthat's most important first in general\nmy recommendation though is to do the\nbigger muscle group first how many sets\nand how often should one perform\ntraining for muscular endurance\nand when now the lovely part here is\nwe've moved down the Spectrum past\nhypertrophy\nyou don't need a lot of load here in\nfact the load only needs to be at or\nslightly above what you want to move\nso if you want to get better at\nmoving 50 of your one rep max you don't\nreally need to train much more than 50\nmaybe 55 or 60 percent of your one or\nMax because if you go higher than that\nthe repetition count is going to fall\nand you're no longer going to be\ntraining muscular endurance so you just\nneed to stay right around that number\nthat you want to work on so again if the\ntarget is doing more pull-ups and\nassuming that you have the strength to\ndo it you check that box you simply need\nto practice the repetition range that\nyou want to be in that's all it takes\nyou can repeat that a number of times\nbut because remember the volume is\nfairly low the load is very very low you\ncan actually repeat these quite\nfrequently so you won't get extremely\nsore from muscular endurance relative to\ntraditional hypertrophy straining\nbecause the load is very very light so\nyou can do these more frequently if you\nwould like\nmore frequently such as you could do it\nthree or four times a week easy if you\nwould like you don't necessarily need to\nthree days a week per muscle group is\nprobably fine here\num if you wanted to do more sets on a\ngiven day and do less days that would be\nfine so if you want to do two days a\nweek and you say wanted to do let's say\nyou could do 25 push-ups and the goal is\nto get to 30 push-ups just as an example\nyou might say okay I'm gonna do sets of\n17.\nand I'm going to do three sets of that\nI'm gonna do that three days a week\nthat's going to build up quite a bit or\nyou could say look I'm gonna do a set\nbasically to failure I'm going to\nrecover and do one or two sets that say\n80 percent\nand I'll do that twice a week\nthat's going to push the pace pretty\nwell you're going to have a lot of gains\nfrom that and again this is not about\nhypertrophy this is about muscular\nendurance so I do want to emphasize and\nagain please correct me if I'm um\ntalking out of line here I do want to\nemphasize that\nbecause we mentioned pull-ups if you\ncan't get 25 pull-ups then and you're\ndoing 10 you're training for hypertrophy\nyou're not training for muscular\nendurance personally remember there's a\nbig cross over here\nso anytime we're talking past like 15\nreps we're technically in hypertrophy\nand muscular endurance got it so here's\nthe common mistake\nI don't want to get bulky\nso I'm I'm gonna go lighter and do more\nreps\nand then people grow and then you landed\nstill right in the middle of hypertri\nrank right so like for people who are\nlike oh my gosh like every time I lift\nweights I blow up I go lighter I do more\nreps and I you're still writing the\nhypertrophy song they'd actually be much\nbetter off training very very heavy in\nthe one to three rep range they'd get\nreally strong and they wouldn't grow\nmuch exactly\nso tell me if this is a reasonable\nprotocol for what I'm going to call the\ntypical person in my mind the typical\nperson is somebody who hopefully is\ndoing resistance training hitting that\n10 sets per muscle group per week\nminimum yep\nto maintain or build strength and\nhypertrophy\nbut is also doing some long duration\ntraining that we'll talk about in a\nlittle bit maybe throwing in uh high\nintensity workout here there some\nSprints maybe some plyometrics\nsome skill based training they're doing\na bunch of different things to be all\nwhat I would call All Around fit yeah\nthey're not training for any specific\nevent or trying to maximize any one of\nthe nine adaptations to the exclusion of\nthe others\nthat person decide okay after\num they do their longer run they're\ngonna do uh Max time a plank to Max\nduration\nthey're going to do a wall set to Max\nduration and they're going to do\npush-ups to Max duration and then also\ndo that same workout before they do\ntheir high intensity interval training\nsome other point during the week and\nthen maybe even do it uh again\num on their so-called rest day just a\nreal quick five minutes of sure and in\ndoing so build more capillaries into the\nrelevant muscle groups and build their\nmuscular endurance yep without eating\ninto their overall recovery too much too\nmuch yeah so again the nice part about\nthis is they don't Hammer you too much\nyou're not going to get tremendously\nsore if you keep the load light the only\nswitch I'd make there is I would\nprobably do them after your interval\nrather than before so you can make sure\nyou keep quality there and you're not\ncompromised by a local muscular\nendurance when you're actually trying to\nget a more systemic fatigue with\nsomething like a higher intensity\ninterval training so that would work\nfantastic the only other variable we\nhave in it on here is progression and\nthis is very simple try to add a rep or\ntwo per week\nthat's really all you have to go after\nso if you're up to 22 this week try to\nhit 23 next week or for wall sits and\nplanks that would be added add time time\nyep and if and if you run into a wall\nthere\njust like the same Concepts we talked\nabout with strength or hypertrophy back\nit down to more like in the 80 or 85\nrange and accumulate a lot more practice\nthat's going to help a lot with\ncapitalization as well as asset\nbuffering so you're going to continue to\ngive yourself signals for up regulation\nof the processes needed for that and\nit's not always pushing you to the end\nfailure just like we don't want to\nalways go to failure with strength we\ndon't want to always go to failure with\nhigh intensity intervals either same\nthing would be happening here\nwhat about anaerobic capacity how should\npeople train for anaerobic capacity\nwhat exactly are they training for\nmeaning what is the structural or seller\nadaptation or adaptations that are\noccurring that allow for increases in\nanaerobic capacity and why are increases\nin anaerobic capacity good for us\neven if we're a quote unquote endurance\nathlete or we are a recreational\nexerciser who is not interested in\nbuilding more muscle speed or things\nthat I typically associate with\nanaerobic capacity yeah so this is\nreally really fun\nremember anaerobic capacity is the total\namount of work you can do for something\nlike seconds to a few minutes and this\nis extremely high levels of fatigue the\nhighest you're really going to see and\nby fatigue here I mean acid buildup\nbyproducts not fatigue is in like\nmentally I don't want to do this anymore\nso if we just think about the energetic\nfor a second\nI'm gonna do say let's take a really\neasy example of people have done that\nthing where you uh you'll go to the\ntrack and you sprint the straightaways\nand you walk the corners remember that\nsort of thing yeah uh tabatas\n30 on 30 off things like this like this\nis what we're talking about in this kind\nof anaerobic capacity area now\nhere's what's going to happen is fat\ngoing to be your limiting no we've\nalready made that clear right what about\ncarbohydrates well if it's a single bout\nor a two or three bouts probably not but\nif you're doing this for a long time say\nyou're going to go 30 on 30 off for 20\nrounds you may actually start reaching a\npoint of running out of my muscle\nglycogen\nin any of those cases though you're\ngoing to be running into an acid problem\nif you were to continue to do this\nmultiple repetitions in addition to\nrunning low and muscle glycogen you're\nalso going to start running into oxygen\ntransportation problems\nbecause you're building up a lot of\nbyproducts you've got to continue you\nwill actually cruise into aerobic\nglycolysis this is exactly why the\ncommunity that I have worked a lot with\nprofessional fighters\nvery high level boxers world champions\nUFC fighters it is a five minute round\nthat you're going to do five times this\nis for world championship fights you get\none minute break in between so imagine\ngoing like 30 on 30 off for five minutes\ngetting a one minute break and doing\nthat five times\neven though the individual ballots are\n30 seconds long the entire thing lasts\nso long it is primarily aerobic\nyou have to have both capacities you got\nto get really high anaerobic you also\nhave to have a lot of aerobic going on\nyou have you're going to start running\ninto limitations because of heart rate\nstroke volume and then even potentially\nventilation\nthe need for oxygen to be able to come\nin and clear the carbon dioxide totally\nout of the system becomes a problem\nbecause not only are you having so much\nbuild up for such a long time you're\nalso using multiple muscle groups so now\nthis is a very important distinction\nmuscular endurance tends to be localized\nnow this is not\nright if you're doing these intervals\nyou're on an assault bike you're\nsprinting up a hill you're grappling\nwith somebody you have a lot of muscles\nbeing involved which means all of that\nwaste is being dumped into the central\npart you have to clear it and I'm by\nclearance I now mean not out of the\nmuscle I mean out of the body\nso your ability to bring in and utilize\noxygen is going to be a major limitation\nto your ability to handle this stuff so\nwhat do you do\nwell specificity wins practice the exact\nthing you're talking about so if you\nwant to get better at sprinting the\nstraightaways and walking the corners do\nthat\nyou can't always do it though you're\ngoing to run into limitations so this is\nwhen backing off to a lower intensity\nis going to give you a lot of benefits\nwe know very clearly if you want to\nimprove cardiovascular fitness high\nintensity moderate intensity and low\nintensity are effective and you actually\nprobably want to do a little bit of all\nof them\nthis is why none of our Fighters would\never just do high intensity training\nthere's going to be some moderate we\ntend to call this like cardiac output\ntraining you can think of this as like\nanywhere between Zone 2 to zone four if\nyou like zones I don't use them\npersonally so I'm just going to\nintentionally interrupt you because this\nissue of zones has come up a few times I\nwant to make sure everybody's on the\nsame page you also mentioned that you\ndon't necessarily favor the Zone\nnomenclature but for those not familiar\nZone one two three four all the way up\nto five\nis a kind of uh back of the envelope uh\ntype verbiage for some people and is\nmore precisely followed by for other\npeople meaning\nfor me uh Zone one is simply walking uh\neasy walking zone two would be for\nanybody the\nPace or intensity of exercise that one\ncould perform while still maintaining a\nconversation but just barely\nmeaning if you were to push any harder\nthen it would be difficult to hold that\nconversation then you'd be in zone three\nand then zone three four five as I\nunderstand them are a little bit vague\nbut maybe you could give us a sense of\nthe breathing patterns associated with\neach of the zones so that people could\nmap to those uh when we discuss Zone one\nthrough five uh and as I say all this I\ncertainly\num tip my hat to all of those people out\nthere who like to measure percent of\nmaximum heart rate they like to use\nheart rate monitors\num they're using any number of different\ndevices I sometimes use those devices\nbut in general I tend not to and I use\nmy breathing as a Rough Guide of which\nzone I'm in so before we go back to\nspecific protocols for anaerobic\ncapacity\ntell me how you think about Zone one\nthrough five and how people might be\nable to assess whether or not they are\nin zone one two three or four or five\ngreat so zone five is that absolute top\nthing and we can flag ourselves there I\nliked how you flagged one and two the\ndistinction between three four and five\nI'm less concerned with either uh we\nwill do some heart rate stuff but not to\nidentify what zone we're in\num the fact is the distinction between\nthose zones is basically just made up\nright that not that it's fake but\nthere's no like\nrationale there it's a little bit like\nperceived effort and weightlifting you\nknow how are you at 100 output or 70 you\nknow when you're at zero and you know\nwhen you're at 100 in that moment but\nthe difference between 60 and 70 is\nanybody's guess totally so we use or the\nrelevance right so why does it matter if\nI'm at 60 or 70. is there actual\ndifference there's not right so it\ndoesn't really matter in that regard\num if you're a very highly trained\nparticularly cyclist things like that\nthen and you can control a lot of\ncircumstances those things start to make\na lot more sense um but when you're in\nan open environment like the athletes I\ndeal with\njust not gonna it's not gonna matter\nthat much so the way that I approach\nthis is\nand I will use this word intentionally\nstolen directly from Brian McKenzie and\nhis company shift adapt they use what's\ncalled a gear system and I absolutely\nlove it it's what we've been using for a\nlong time\nso with Brian with your permission I'm\ngoing to take it right now thank you\nBrian he gave me the permission to thank\nyou Brian Brian's a good friend of of\nours and I do think the breathing gear\nsystem is a terrific way to think about\nthe zones and to get a good sense of\nwhat zone one happens to be yeah great\nso um the first gear is your ability to\nSimply breathe in and out through your\nnose at a set Cadence so basically\nregardless of how hard you're working\ncan you restrict your breathing to like\na two to three second inhale\nand then a two to three second exhale\nand this is really clever actually\nbecause\na lot of folks will jump immediately\ninto an over breathing strategy which\nmeans you'll be ventilating more than\nyou need which actually sends that rer\nup higher than it needs to be which\nkicks you higher into carbohydrate\nutilization if you're supposed to be in\nquote unquote Zone one you're trying to\nbe efficient not fast so using more\ncarbohydrates than you need is not\nbeneficial here\nyou're walking for the day you're out on\na longer hike you're enjoying the day\nyou shouldn't be trying to ramp up\ncarbohydrate metabolism it should be\nall right and so this would be getting\ninto an argument with somebody while on\na long walk you feel exhausted\nafterwards and over breathing yeah\ntotally right okay yeah so you should be\nable to breathe at a specific Cadence\nand generally people are um doing that\nmore frequently than they need right\nzone two uh rather gear two\nis\ninhaling and exhaling at whatever rate\nyou needed to be but still nasal only so\nit is a force\nright whatever you need to do but your\nmouth is closed the entire time\nyou've shifted higher up you're burning\nmore and more carbohydrate as the fuel\nsource but you're still able to control\nthat and restrict the nasal breathing\nnow gear three and four which is our\nfinal ones there's no gear five gear uh\nthree and four is like a subtle strength\nand I actually don't even care about the\ndifference there I basically use gear\none two and then S4 but you're basically\ntalking about either a nose to mouth\nstrategy\nor a straight up mouth mouth right so\nbreathing in through the nose out\nthrough the mouth if you can control it\nthat way you can do the opposite\nactually right can you breathe in\nand out through your nose but the\nclassic one people do is enter the nose\nout the mouth\num again I really don't even care about\ndistinction I basically jump from two to\nfour Brian May do it differently I don't\nactually know\num four is just mouth mouth right and\nthis is the case in most sporting\napplications you're going to be\nbreathing\nbecause the nose is restricted right\nthere's only so much space and as we\ntalked about earlier the consequences of\nnot having enough oxygen in or CO2\nexhalation if you're restricting that\nthis is going to be problematic so in\nyour actual competition please go to the\nmouth if you need to right we practice a\nlot trying to stay nasal only for as\nlong as possible but that's going to\neventually happen when you're doing your\nhigh intensity intervals and you're\nreally going as hard as you can you're\ngoing to have to go to your mouth unless\nyou're an absolute Freakazoid and you\ncan say in your nose but that's not\ngoing to happen right most people can't\nget past say 70 or 80 percent\nwhile breathing through your nose um I\nknow some people can get higher but\nthat's the general distinction so we pay\nmuch more attention to those particular\ngears than we do heart rate zones and\nzone five would be just pure mouth\nbreathing all out and then running into\nyour life the gear system is just one to\nfour there's no fifth gear got it so the\ngear four would again be mouth mouth\nbreathing as much in as you can\nbreathing as much as you can out got it\nand I I appreciate your description of\nof the gear system and how it um roughly\nrelates to the zones we've been talking\nabout also\num I'm reminded if anyone wants to\nexperience the relationship between\nbreathing in the offloading of carbon\ndioxide and your ability to exert effort\nin anything a game that a friend of mine\nsometimes likes to play when we walk or\nJog and talk is he'll say let's just\nhold our breath now until we hit that\npiling or that\num uh lifeguard stand on the beach and\nwithin seconds you actually can start to\npanic absolutely also becomes very hard\nto coordinate your action after a little\nwhile again be really careful with this\nbut but it will teach you in a moment in\na very real world way how important it\nis to be able to offload carbon dioxide\nbecause you're probably not running out\nof oxygen at those lower intensities no\nquestions You're simply building up\ncarbon dioxide and that gas reflex is\nscreaming to go off and you're actively\nsuppressing it yeah so the interesting\ntest here is your CO2 Tolerance on\nRyan's website you can go directly there\nyou can there's a video to how to run\nthis test and then you can put in your\nnumbers and it'll tell you sort of\nexactly what to do as a result of it but\nthe CO2 tolerance test is a test of\nexactly what you just mentioned so you\nshould be fairly tolerant in other words\nnon-reactive\ncan be responsive but non-reactive\ntwo elevations in CO2 so you should see\nthem and feel them but you should be\nchoosing how you respond rather than\nadding a reaction\num there are interesting data looking at\nthings like out of the blue panic\nattacks\nyou can actually notice those in blood\nvia rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes prior\nto the event happening so there are\nsignals happening in your body that you\nmay be sensitive or not sensitive to the\nmore in tune you can get with that the\nbetter your life is going to be and even\nif we're specifically just talking about\nexercise performance so it's okay for\nCO2 to rise it's going to rise it's a\nbyproduct of anaerobic anaerobic\nmetabolism it's a byproduct of\ncarbohydrate and fat metabolism as we've\nestablished it's going to get there\nyou're going to feel that however if you\nimmediately go into a panic because of a\nsmall increase in CO2\nthis is a problem so returning to\nanaerobic capacity this morning we were\ntraining not together I couldn't keep up\nwith your workout but I uh but in the\nsame uh General space and I did my once\na week maximum heart rate uh one minute\nSprint on the assault bike sometimes\nI'll do more minutes uh meaning I will\ndo a one minute then take some rest and\ndo another minute after some rest but I\ndecided to do that one minute with you\nthere so I could learn from you and\nindeed\num\nI have to assume that that was largely\nwithin the anaerobic capacity Realm\nthe first 30 seconds or so were\nmanageable we're getting more and more\npainful there was a quit signal going\noff in my head you said there's real\nmagic that occurs around second 40 and\nindeed somewhere around second 40 for\nwhatever reason it seemed easier but at\nthe one minute Mark I was happy to stop\nbecause I was really at at least what\nfell to me uh 100 output yeah is that a\ngood protocol for building up anaerobic\ncapacity keeping in mind what you said\nbefore which is that specificity or\nprecision as you've raised it\num is important that is if I want to\ntrain uh anaerobic capacity for\nsprinting I probably should have been\nsprinting cycling I was I was on the\nassault bike\num and so on\nhow many of those one minute all out\nSprints or 30 second all-out sprints on\nthe on the bike\ncould and should one perform per workout\nand per week so marching through\nexercise Choice yep let's do it um order\nvolume frequency and progression yep\nchoice of exercises\ntrain for what you want to improve is\nthat right\nnot necessarily so in this particular\ncase if you have a specific goal yes of\ncourse Do It\num exercise Choice a couple of things\nyou want to look for you want to pick\nsomething that you feel extremely\nconfident in the movement with\nbecause you're going to forget your\nbrain very quickly here because you're\ngoing to go into our pain cave okay so\nif you're not comfortable running\ndon't go run here you're never going to\nget to the spot we need to get to it if\nyou're not comfortable or if every time\nyou you go on a rower your low back\nhurts the next day\ndon't do it if you're not comfortable\nusing kettlebell swings you get the\npoint don't do an exercise you're not\ncomfortable with you also secondarily\nwant to be carefully cautious of heavy\neccentric loads\nbecause you're going to be doing a lot\nof repetitions at a high intensity so\nthis is where I love an assault bike\nthis is why a rower is great swimming is\namazing running uphill\ngenerally more favorable than running on\nnormal ground especially if you're not\nRunner don't run downhill that's a lot\nof eccentric load I don't love things\nlike box jumps here\nright because again a lot of eccentric\nloading if suppose you can jump up land\non the box step down but now you're\nyou're again you're too many things are\ngoing in your mind I don't want to slip\nand fall I don't want to smash my\non the box what happens if I'm too many\nvariables\npick something that is safer where you\ncan really focus on your breathing and\nyour posture\nand the performance\nall right so that's exercise Choice and\nthen within that if there's some\nspecific thing you want to get better at\ngo ahead do it okay\nhow many different movements meaning\nshould I do the assault bike and then uh\nsome form of safe executable uh overhead\npressing\num it's a little hard it's a little\nharder to imagine\num anaerobic capacity for the upper body\nunless you have access to a skier or one\nof these um what are those things called\nthe climber machines yeah the reversal\nclimber the Versa climber that's the one\nthe Versa climber\num you can tell how often I do that one\nuh it's a great exercise so great piece\nof exercise equipment yeah so we're\nthinking how many how many\nhow many exercises and in what order is\nit going to be two or three exercises\nsince you're involving a lot of muscle\ngroups typically that's a really\ndistinction generally these are going to\nbe total body movements so you can do\nsomething like a ski org if you want to\nreally isolate your upper body great\nlove that you can do lower body\nisolation like cycling right where\neverybody's not involved you can use\nweights here you can do some barbell\nmovements and stuff like that\nthey're just not my favorite choices for\nmost people\ntoo many complexity things going on so\nuh I generally am going to pick total\nbody movements uh pushing a sled\ndragging a sled sprinting uphill\nswimming these things like that are\ngoing to be good I'm seeing now why the\nassault bike is such a powerful tool\nbecause you're using your arms with some\ndegree of resistance but not a lot of\neccentric load plus legs some resistance\nnot a lot of eccentric load and yet one\ncan go quote unquote all out for 30 to\n60 seconds yep and and the consequences\nof a technical breakdown are minimal\nit's more like you're gonna actually\nhave a worse performance rather than an\ninjury rate so there's just a wonderful\ninvention uh because of that where other\nthings the consequences like say if\nyou're going to be doing a barbell or\nkettlebell activity the consequences of\nmaking a technical mistake\nyou might actually get an acute injury\nright there so they're just a little bit\nhigher in the risk scale how many sets\nor sometimes referred to as repeats so\nhow many 30 to 60 second\nall out sprints again doesn't have to be\nrunning sprinting but all out effort\nwould be the better way to phrase it\nshould I perform\nlet's say per week right and then decide\nwhether or not we can divide those up\nacross multiple workouts or whether or\nnot it's better to do them in the same\nworkout yeah if you're staying with the\nsame exercise for all of your workouts\nthat's a little bit different answer\nthan if you're if you're modifying them\nso say you're going to do this three\ntimes a week and you're gonna do an air\nbike one day you're gonna do some Hill\nSprints another day and then you can do\nsome swimming another day for sake of\nexample I'm going to say\num same movement\nbecause I think most people are going to\nbe most comfortable with one or two\ntypes of movements unless they are\nreally coordinated or an excellent\nathlete I think most people can probably\nfind a hill that they could run up yeah\nand uh an aerodyne or assault bike a\nrower things of that sort yep you're\ngonna\nhave a pro and a con here so the pro of\ndoing less sets is you can actually\ntrain much closer to truly 100 percent\nthe downside is volume slow\nokay so a major mistake people make here\nis they'll do something like\num I'll do 20 seconds on 10 seconds off\nand I'll do that for 40 rounds\nyou're not really actually going that\nhard on those 20 seconds so a key in\nfact if you look at the literature and\nall the buzz and all the positive\nbenefits of high intensity neural\ntraining that assumes you are actually\nhitting very close to 100 percent\nif you're sliding down into like again\nmoderate training stuff you start to\nactually be in a spot where you're not\ngetting the total\nhigh-end stuff but you're not doing it\nlong enough to get the low end stuff\neither and so you end up in this like\nyou burn some calories you probably\nstill enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis\nand a little bit of capitalization but\nyou didn't really justify only doing\nthree rounds\nthat's where the problem comes in\nso in terms of a couple of protocols\nI'll give you how many sets per week\nit's it's really hard to give a number\nunlike the strength training stuff where\nit was easy to kind of land some stuff\non a typical thing you'll see is like a\nminimum dose tends to be something like\nfour rounds per day three times per week\nwow that's a lot so my once a week\nall-out effort of sprinting on the\nassault bike the so-called Airline bike\nfor 60 seconds\none to three rounds of that\nmight be doing something useful for me\nbut I should probably be doing that\ntwo or three times a week if you're\ngonna get to a max heart rate I\ngenerally like to say give me a minimum\nof one day a week two's better\ndays per week how many rounds whatever\nit takes you to get to that maximum\nheart rate right so in your case you did\none minute okay good if you're gonna\nextend past a minute or two\none round might be enough so for example\nuh if you want to just do something\nwhere I'm going to run a mile as fast as\nI can that's all you need to do for the\nday you don't need to do multiple you\ncan do mile repeats if you'd like but\nthat is really really challenging I know\nwe've extended the time duration here\nbut I wanted to go there to show you\nthe time domain matters here if you're\ndoing something like a 20 second burst\nyou're going to need more rounds if\nyou're doing something longer like\nmultiple minutes you don't need as many\nrounds to get there so in addition\nif you're really reaching past this\num 90 seconds of of Hell window\nit's just going to do a lot more damage\nto the system not damaging than bad but\nas in there's a lot to recover here so\nwe need more recovery time from that a\n20 second burst\ndoesn't really challenge you challenge\nyou in that 20 seconds but you'll be\nrecovered and fine a three minute thing\nis going to hurt and it's going to hurt\nfor many many minutes after that and\nyou're going to still see maybe some\nperformance decrements the next day\ndepending on what your recovery stuff\nlooks like so a couple of things to pay\nplay with would be something like this\nif you want to try like a classic 30\nseconds on 30 seconds off protocol the\nliterature will show like a minimum of\nfour rounds of that probably three days\na week so 30 seconds all out 30 seconds\nrest is one round repeat that four times\nat least once a week at least two would\nbe better great right if you want to go\nsomething a lot longer than that you\nmight be able to get away with one but\ngenerally two days a week of this is\nbetter if you start actually pushing\npast like three to four days a week up\nto five or six you may actually be\ncausing some problems\num there's just a little bit of excess\nfatigue that's going to happen there\nthat you you maybe want to stay away\nfrom in fact you can see a lot of\nendocrinological problems and some other\nsleep issues and some other things kick\nin and we'll talk about more of those\nthings as later but um that's the number\nto get with if you want to try something\nmore like a 20 second burst I actually\nwould recommend giving yourself more\nrest\nso you can actually do a higher rest\nthan work ratio most people tend to\nthink of this as doing like one to one\n20 seconds on 20 seconds off or lower I\nlove doing like 20 seconds on 40 seconds\noff\nthe quality of that 20 seconds becomes\nextraordinarily high and it's also\npossible to now get like six to eight\nrounds so as I'm hearing this I'm going\nto wager a uh an offer uh to you and if\nyou say Okay\num then to to those listening based on\nwhat you're telling me about the\nrelationship between intensity and\nquality\nand the need for\nsufficient duration of this anaerobic\nwork yeah\nhow is five to six minutes per week of\nall out work that's pretty good so what\nthat means for me is I would do three\nall out one minute sprints\non one workout separated by a minute or\ntwo\nmaybe more\nand I would do that two or three times\nper week\njust trying to hit that five or six\nminute per week threshold yep actually I\nthink uh one of the uh\nMarty gabala is the scientist a Canadian\nuh guy amazing work he was done a lot of\nthe the research on high intensity\ninterval stuff right and I think the\nnumber he actually threw out there is\nsome of his original research was\ncomparing six total minutes of work to\nupwards of like 180 minutes of work\nthroughout\num the entire week and and one of the\nclassic studies was looking at VO2 max\nimprovements and he saw equal if not\ngreater improving civil to Max with that\nso I think actually the name of his book\nmight be like the six minute workout or\nsomething and so you'd like may have\nnailed that directly on the head uh\npurely by law but actually but I also\nmay be wrong with the numbers we should\nprobably fact check that yeah Will and\nalso by inference from what you were\nsaying you know if you're going to do\nthis 20 seconds on 40 seconds off and\nyou're doing more rounds or one minute\nall out so the way I'm going to think\nabout this if it's okay with you is for\nfive to six minutes a week\nI am sprinting yeah for my life correct\nbut I'm sprinting for my life with good\nform in whatever movement I happen to be\ndoing and I can do all of that in one\nworkout but I'm separating out bouts of\n20 seconds all the way up to one minute\nyep by the necessary rest in order to\nrecover my breathing get back to Pure\nnasal breathing maybe Zone one zone\ntotally totally and then hit it again if\nyou're gonna do the one minute thing\nlike you do I actually generally\nencourage one to three minutes of rest\nbefore you do the next round and\nprobably up to four to six rounds that\nwould be your six minute number there\nnow the caveat there is we don't worry\nabout heart rate recovery we worry about\nexactly what you mentioned which is\nnasal only recovery once you can get\nback to that give yourself another 30\nseconds or so and then you're ready to\ngo for round two this is where it gets\nfun because I can imagine challenging\nmyself to get on the assault bike for\none minute of kind of warm-up very low\nintensity each morning and then Sprint\nfor a minute and then head off into my\ndaily routine no okay that\nif you're going to do that though you\nneed to give me three minutes of nasal\nonly breathing before you go back to\nwork\nwe need to download and there are people\nin my life that would love for me to\nengage in more nasal breathing because\nit will have me speaking less so no\nproblem chances are I'm going to use the\num two or three workouts per week of a\none minute all out maybe I'll try the\nshorter protocol can I give you one fun\nprotocol to try here please so if you\nhave a you can use this on any equipment\num but I learned this from another\nmutual friend Kenny Kane this is a great\nlittle it's a little test a little a\nlittle game you can play with yourself\nand the only way to play this game is\nyou're going to lose\nwhich is really really lovely so you can\ndo this at any rate you can do this for\nany duration of time but two minutes is\na good number Okay so you have to do\nthis in somewhere where you can no\ndistance so this could be running\ncycling the the air bike is what I use\nthe first two minutes you're going to\ncover as much distance as you can\npossibly cover in two minutes\nand you're going to note that so let's\nsay you covered\n400 meters\nright okay great you're going to rest\nfor two minutes\namazing that next round you're now going\nto go for distance so you're going to\ncover the exact same amount of distance\nyou covered in round one which in this\nexample is 400 meters\nand it doesn't matter how long it takes\nyou\nit may take you two minutes and five\nseconds two minutes and 10 seconds\nbecause you're a little bit fatigued\nfrom round one round three you're gonna\nnow come back and do that exact same\ntime domain that you did in round two so\nif it took you two minutes and five\nseconds in round two now round three is\ngoing to last two minutes and five\nseconds and you want to see if you can\ncover a greater distance\n405 meters 410 meters and then you did\nin round one and the beauty of this\nlittle protocol six minutes total of\nwork right\nbut if you slack in one of the rounds\nyou just make the next round harder is\nthere any rest between rounds yeah two\nminutes\nalways two minutes rest you don't have\nto but this would be my recommendation\nKenny king came up with this I don't\nknow if he came up with it he taught me\nthis thing we both know Kenny and he's\nan incredibly nice and Incredibly\nskilled trainer um I'm gonna call it the\nsugar cane yeah it's so great because it\nsounds really painful and if you go out\ntoo hard in round one\nyou're in such big trouble round two but\nif you go to Easy in round one you're\ngoing to get absolutely obliterated in\nround three so it's like a wonderful\nthing and you can pick that number as a\nstandardization and then just try to\nimprove that a little bit per week so\nprogression is the last part of this\nwhole thing that we haven't got to yet\nbefore we move on\num and the way you want to progress all\nof these things\nis you can time stamp again how much\nwork you can do and then just try to do\na slightly higher amount of work five\npercent or so\nevery week or you can add a round which\nis a really nice way so\num uh in the in the research studies\nthat have been done they're going to do\nthings like week one you'll do three\nrounds week two you'll do four rounds\nthree you'll go five rounds you'll like\nadd a round until you get up to say six\nor seven or eight rounds at the end of\nthe protocol so that's a really nice way\nto go about it or you can cap the rounds\nand just try to get more work done in\nthat same amount of time meaning go more\nintensely correct get you know get\nfurther distance in your 30 seconds or\nyour 45 seconds or whatever\num I want to encourage people\nto go as low as 20 seconds\nthat's going to allow you to go very\nvery fast that's going to actually\nchallenge that phospho creatine piece a\nlittle bit I want to encourage people to\nalso go as high as 90 seconds so the\nhonest way the way that I will do it not\nthat it's about me but just as an\nexample of something you could do I do\nsomething in the 15 to 22nd burst range\nand I will generally hedge towards a two\nto one rest to work ratio so I'm\nprobably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds\nthat's true that's to make sure that 20\nsecond burst is extremely high quality\ncool I'm also going to do something in\nthe 30 to 50 second range okay I might\ngo one-to-one work rest ratio\nthe quality of those 30 seconds is going\nto come down\nbut the acid buffering is going to be\nextraordinarily challenged\nI also will do that with a triple or\nquadruple rest range so again 30 seconds\non maybe two minutes off\nnow I won't be able to be I won't be\nworking on my ability to handle\num the waste product build up there but\nI'll be working on my ability to produce\nmore force over that time which is\nanother skill set and then all the way\nup to say what you do a minute 70\nseconds and you can go one to one there\nor up to three to one um you're gonna be\nworking on a little bit of this\ndifferent thing but that's exactly how\nwe hit both sides of this equation\nworking on dealing with waste as well as\nactually working on bringing in\nnutrients and getting that system a\nlittle bit more effective so you could\nset that up across your week\nand just it could be something like\nday one is that 20 second burst window\nday two is that maybe 60 second window\nand then day three is maybe one all-out\neffort\nand we're done there let's talk about\nthe specific protocols and adaptations\nrelated to maximum aerobic output or\nmaximum aerobic capacity as it's\nsometimes called sure now we're moving\npast like that couple of minute range\ninto like the you know five to 15 minute\nrange but at a maximum intensity so\nwhat's the highest you can go from there\nwe're not talking about our last\ncategory of long duration here well the\nbeautiful part is we've already\nexplained a lot of it because it's very\nsimilar to what we just talked about\nwith anaerobic capacity it is primarily\ngoing to be a problem\nI'm dealing with waste products\nespecially at the end it's not enough\ntotal distance to be running out of\nmuscle glycogen though it may start to\ncreep down a little bit Fat's not going\nto be an issue but certainly more oxygen\ntransportation is going to be an issue\nso we're just hedging a little bit more\ntowards that side of the equation\ntowards the end of that workout\nno doubt about it clearing out waste\nproducts is going to be a huge issue but\nreally oxygen demand delivery is\nstarting to take more of a prominent\nrole because we have had more time to\nclear the waste and if we're not good at\nthat we're going to be failing earlier\nthan we need\nso the training for that needs to be a\nlittle bit\nat that exact same so a classic thing\nhere is a one mile\ntest right this is going to last for\nmost people somewhere between five and\nten minutes you're sort of right in this\nwindow if you just want to practice that\nonce a week we're done here right\nexercise Choice same thing we talked\nabout right pick an exercise you're\ncomfortable with that you can actually\ndo and you can progressively increase in\nterms of the intensity um you're not\ngoing to be you don't have to stop and\nchange your exercise you're not going to\nmove around it's like a circuit isn't\ngreat here because you got to put one\nImplement down pick up another one you\nwant to be doing something where there\nis literally not a second of off switch\nso similar exercise Choice principles we\njust covered\nif you gonna become a real Savage and\nyou want to do repeats here you can\num endurance folks will do that a lot\none of my repeats 800 meter repeats\nthings like that or I'm not sure what\nthe swimming distance equivalents would\nbe but swimmers we do this constantly\nbut you don't need to\nthis is really hard it's pretty hard in\nthe system it's very good for you one to\ntwice a week of hitting this I think\nyou'll be in a really really good spot\nfrequency we sort of just covered we\ncovered exercise Choice volume we just\nsort of nailed and intensity is\nbasically running you up to the top\nthere now because you can only do that\nso often you want to add in another 40\nor so percent of your time being lower\nintensity support work for that so this\nis something probably less than 85\npercent of your heart rate but higher\nthan quote unquote zone two you got to\nbe working here this is not I could have\na conversation Pace this is higher than\nthat it's in between conversation pace\nand the pace I need to be at to run my\nfastest mile I've ever done that's that\nmiddle ground and you need to train that\nso that you can continue to work on\ncapitalization auctioning Transportation\nbut you're not burning down the house\ngetting all the way up to 100\n100 plus percent of your vo to Max\ncould I use a uh accrued version of this\nwhere I say okay I'm going to exercise\nfor 10 minutes I'm going to go as fast\nas I safely can\nand\nevery week I'm going to measure how far\nI travel\nyep in that 10 minutes love it\nprobably not on the same day that I'm\ndoing the anaerobic capacity work\nprobably not\nif you're probably okay to do after a\nstrength training or hypertrophy workout\nas long as I didn't train legs you could\num\nis probably going to compromise recovery\nis the way so I would if you're going to\ndo a session like this I would probably\ndo it on its own day unless you wanted\nto do something like speed or power\nthen you could roll right into this and\nhave no problem\nmaybe a strength day a hypertrophy day\nI'm not sure\num you would do there because again\nespecially if you did any sort of lower\nbody exercise you're going to be\ncompromised here but remember these tend\nto be full body movements so even if you\ndid arms that day your arms are going to\nbe compromised and you don't want to\nfail this because of local muscular\nfailure\nall right so now I've got my work cut\nout for me I'm going to be doing five to\nsix minutes per week of all out work\ndivided into 60 20 a 60 second\nbout with sufficient rest and I'm going\nto give myself 10 minutes a week of\nin my case it'll probably be running as\nfast as I can because I do enjoy running\nand I can do it safely\num maybe uphill and see how far I go yep\nif you want to combine the two\nso if you're just saying hey I'm bought\nin Andy like I want to do both of these\nthings they are similar but they have\nindependent benefits I'm convinced how\nwould I build these into the same week\num maybe do one of each that still gets\nyou at quote unquote two days per week\nwhere you're going to hit a hot maximum\nheart rate so we already checked that\nbox off so one day can be a shorter\nlength interval repeat one and the other\none can simply be a 5 to 15 minute\nmaximum work and you're done long\nduration\nendurance exercise the stereotypical\nendurance exercise sure\nhow far how long how fast or how slow\nrather should I go and here I'm gonna\nVenture that exercise choice is one that\nwe could click off even at this point in\nthe discussion because obviously it's\ngot to be something that I can do for a\nlong while without getting injured uh\noveruse injuries\num there's a little bit of novelty we\ncan actually throw in here so\none of the things I love to do for long\nduration and endurance for people who\ndon't love running cycling or swimming\nis you can do a really cool workout any\nnumber of things where you can put a\nlittle circuit together as long as\nthere's not a lot of downtime between\none circuit to the next time you can\nactually do something as simple as like\nmaybe you're going to do Farmer's\ncarries and you'll do that for\nsay three minutes and you'll set those\ndown and you'll go straight into a plank\nfor a minute and you'll pick that up and\nyou go straight into maybe body weight\nsquats for two minutes then you go\nstraight into another exercise and you\ncan sort of rotate things around maybe\nyou can do even some like Shadow Boxing\nstuff or some jump rope you can do\ndifferent gymnastics movements and body\nweight movements and you can run that\nthing through and you can basically get\nthe exact same thing accomplished and\nnot feel like you're doing oh my gosh\nthis mind-numbing type of training if it\nfeels like that to you another way you\ncan do that to actually even simplify it\neven more we've done this at Kenny\nKane's gym plenty of times where you\njust maybe even pick three machines so\nyou're gonna I'm gonna go 10 minutes on\nthe rower then I'm gonna go 10 minutes\non the treadmill and I'm gonna go 10\nminutes on the bike you can actually\nknock a 30 minute quote-unquote steady\nstate session out in and not feel those\nproblems if those things happen so you\ncan actually have a lot of fun there we\nwill do a lot of times\nwith our Fighters we'll do things like\nput a very low load I'm talking sub 50\nof your max on a barbell and you're\ngonna Squat and you're gonna do you know\nmaybe a minute you're gonna put that\ndown and then you're gonna go over and\ndo 50 of a bench press you're gonna put\nthat down you're gonna go over and do 50\nof uh\nof a crab walk and then you're gonna go\nover and do another one and you can\nactually run through this entire thing\nyou don't hit that many reps in any\nindividual movement the load is very\nvery light and you can keep heart rate\nbasically a steady state and do 15 or 20\nor 30 different exercises and it's\nactually like fairly fun and engaging to\ndo and it's a little bit more specific\nthan trying to get a 275 pound NFL\nplayer to run for 30 minutes which is\nnot going to be good so I'm just\nchuckling because I love to run outdoors\nand I've enjoyed runs on all my travels\nand I find it to be a great way to see\ndifferent places and I like moving\nthrough space but there are weather\nconditions and times when that's not an\noption so what you described is a\nterrific alternative I have to\nassume that the specific adaptation\nthat's occurring here is related to the\nfat burning system\nand again that doesn't necessarily mean\nfat loss correct overall but fat burning\nsystem and yet I do have a question\nwhich is can you build enhanced\nmicrocapillary systems into the muscles\nuh by doing this long duration cardio\nyeah absolutely can in fact depending on\nwhich paper you uh like more than the\nother papers you may even find evidence\nthat this is a superior method than\nanything else a steady state endurance\nis very important\nI used to not like it as much\nthere's just so much evidence now that\nsuggests it's probably a really good\nthing for basically everybody maybe for\nsome individuals it's not in all year of\ntheir training but if if you're not a\nhigh-level athlete or have a very\nspecific goal that's right in front of\nyou it's probably best to do at least 20\nminutes as a minimum maybe 30 minutes of\nsome steady state exercise once a week\nfor basically any training goal outside\nof again a couple of really specific\nscenarios that are happening\nthe other thing that kind of kicks in\nhere that we haven't really talked about\nis now we're actually reaching a\nposition where fatigue of the\nintercostal starts to play\nso diaphragmic fatigue starts to run an\nindication so we forget generally\nbreathing is a contraction to open up\nthe lungs to change pressure so the air\nwill flow in and then the exhalation is\npassive right it's just a muscle's been\nstretched it goes back to it's resting\nwhen you get to a maximum heart rate\ninhalation and exhalation become active\nso you're squeezing as hard as you can\nto open up and you're squeezing to\ncontract to blow air out\nyou're going to get fatigued that system\nright over time you have contracted\ncontracted open up if that system starts\nto get fatigued you start running into\nfailure here so you need to practice\nthat and this is when all kinds of\nthings like breathing drills to just\nsimply training in this fashion there's\nall kinds of exercise devices for your\nlungs and when we say that that's what\nwe're really talking about the\nmusculature around the lungs needs to\nnot fatigue so that's the only other\nlittle component I wanted to throw in\nhere if we're not talking about acid\nbuffering\nwhich in this particular case is not a\nproblem anymore\nthe time domain is long and slower so we\nhave plenty of time to use fat as a fuel\nwe also have plenty of time to use\nanaerobic and aerobic glycolysis and\nclear out waste products so we don't\nreally see pH being a problem with this\ntype of exercise you may start running\nlow on liver glycogen if you're going a\nvery long time muscle glycogen may start\ngetting low but not really these are\nhuge issues you're going to run into\nmaybe a little bit of stroke volume\nissue but and the intensity is not high\nenough to become a problem you're more\nlikely to break down posturally or\nbreathing mechanics than really anything\nelse unless again that duration really\ngets generally past two hours for most\npeople so those are the things that are\ngoing to limit us so how do we improve\nit what do we train we went through the\nexercise choices you also need to make\nsure you're training your intercostals\nwe need to be training our diaphragm\nin some fashion again it can be the\nexercise itself can be your normal\ntraining\nthe thing you need to be careful of here\nand this is actually true for all the\nthings we just talked about\nwhen we think about fatigue and we think\nabout failure and endurance we really\nneed to pay attention to technical\nbreakdown\nthat is always the marker we look for so\nwhen we when we go through our stuff\nwith our athletes and they quote unquote\nfail or they finish that's generally\nbecause we saw a massive technical\nbreakdown you're done like you're over\nthere it's not always the case during\nall year round of the training but this\nis something to really pay attention to\nso if you're on that bike and you're 40\nseconds in and all of a sudden posture\nstarts punching over I may stop the test\nI may stop the training it's like no\nwell we decided failure was is when you\nlost your Technique\nto some sufficient level so you want to\npay attention to that too because that's\ngoing to determine your ability to\nperform well as well as maintain\nefficiency which is a really big problem\nhere\ntell me if the protocol I'm about to\ndescribe would be a reasonable one for\npeople to incorporate\n60\nto\n120 Minutes\nof long duration work per week\nso one way to accomplish that that I\noften use is to head out for a\nweight vested hike it's not a heavy\nweight vest it's maybe I think it's\neight or ten pounds it's one of these\nthinner ones and if people don't have\naccess to that you can bring a backpack\nwith some items in it I mean it can be\nyou don't even need external load it\ncould just be your body okay great and\nand do some hiking at a at a fast enough\nclip that breathing harder than I would\nbe if I just kind of shuffled along yeah\nI might stop here there drink some water\nno big deal\nbut I can carry on a conversation if I\nneed to so it's a Zone two-ish but\nprobably pushing a little bit harder\nthan that for that duration yeah not a\nlot of um deep soreness occurring after\nthis maybe a little bit of achiness and\nsome stabilization muscles that were\nused that may not be used Too Much\nespecially if I've been sitting a lot\nduring the week\num kind of reminds me of how much I've\nbeen sitting but doing that all in one\nLong Afternoon\num typically on a weekend or doing two\nshorter sessions throughout the week\nmaybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes and then\nworking up the progression to longer\nlonger duration seems like that would be\nsomething that most people should be\nable to do yep and that it would weave\nin well with any resistance training or\nthe uh anaerobic and aerobic output\ncapacity work that we talked about just\na moment ago great that's a fine version\nto do it if you want to go shorter and\nbring up the intensity a little bit so\nyou want to keep it more to the 30 to 60\nMinute range and go you know closer into\nthe I can't have a conversation right\nnow but again I'm not at a blistering\nheart rate\num then you could probably get that same\nthing done in a smaller time window if\nthat was a consideration so if you\nwanted to blend all three of these\ntogether\nyou have a lot of wiggle room right so\nyou could do something like\norder\nif we're talking about this type of\ntraining you could do this first\nand then finish with either one of the\nhigher intensity stuff we talked about\nso it could be roped into the same thing\nit could be its own independent day\nit could be your sort of active recovery\nday it tends to be fairly restorative as\nyou alluded to a little bit there so\nit's not that big a deal to do this on\nyour quote-unquote off day if you're\nthose\nif you're that type of person who like\neven on your off day you have to do\nsomething physical\nthis is fine right if you wanted to do\nit on a lifting day\nespecially if it's a power or strength\ndate it's probably fine if you wanted to\ndo it before the workout or after it\neither way you're probably okay probably\nbest to do it after\nif the primary goal is one of the\nstrength training adaptations if it's\nnot if this is a primary goal do it\nfirst\namazing if you wanted to do it in the\ncombination\nwith the other interval stuff you could\ndo it fine there you could do it before\nor you could do it afterwards I actually\nhave no problem doing it afterwards\nbecause that in effect\nespecially if you say nasal only during\nthis training will help the down\nregulation go and so you could finish\nthat fairly well down regulated actually\nso it's kind of like a nice way to get\nthoroughly warmed up\ngo really really hard and then give it a\nnice 20 to 30 minute slow back down and\nby the time you finish maybe even on a\nthree minute walk\nnice slow nasal breathing four second\ninhale\nfour seconds and yeah maybe five even\nplay with the numbers a little bit then\nmaybe you don't even need to do the down\nregulation breathing afterwards you'll\nbe in a good spot what you wouldn't want\nto do this before do your intervals\nfinish your intervals throw up lay on\nthe ground sweat all over the gym floor\nget up and go back to work that's\nprobably not our best strategy\nas people are hearing this all they may\nbe thinking wow this is a lot of work to\ndo but I've been keeping track of the\nmath here as I'm sure some of you out\nthere are as well and we're really\ntalking about\n10 minutes of the of running or\nsprinting on the bike or rower once a\nweek we're talking about six minutes or\nso of the much higher intensity but\nshort bouts divided into rounds of 20 to\n20 seconds to a minute with with rest in\nbetween and then some longer duration\nwork out of\n30 minutes minimum but maybe as much as\nan hour even two hours which in total\ndoesn't really equate to that much time\nespecially if one can access these\nthings right out their front door or at\nhome and as we point out you don't need\nany specialized equipment to do that\noh and I forgot the um muscular\nendurance\nthat I wasn't trying to cheat there\num some muscular endurance\nthrown in as well so that brings me to a\nquestion which is\nif I'm doing my training for muscular\nendurance each week for anaerobic\ncapacity and for maximum aerobic output\nand long duration and given that all of\nthat is going to take roughly two hours\nfor the typical person total for the\nentire week which I would argue is going\nto give you back so much life literally\nin terms of longevity you're literally\ngoing to earn back years of your life\nproductivity you name it offsetting all\nsorts of uh metabolic issues and uh\nenhancing your sleep and improving mood\nI mean there's so much data so much data\npointing to all those positive benefits\nif I do all of these things\nand I'm fairly consistent about them am\nI going to be metabolically flexible am\nI going to have a well-developed\nfat burning\ncarbohydrate burning system and\nwill I be essentially fit I mean this is\nnot leaving aside issues of strength and\nhypertrophy which were covered in the\nprevious episode\nwill I be fit I mean to my mind the\nability to you know Sprint very fast if\none needs to the ability to go longer\nduration if one needs to and the ability\nto do something in between as well as\nyou know hold a box overhead if\nnecessary while installing a shelf or\nsomething like that these are the\nrealities of life and to me represent\nreal functional World Fitness if that's\nthe case is there anything that we would\nwant to add to this program or would you\nconsider that a fairly comprehensive and\ncomplete endurance training system if we\nremember the target which is I want to\nhave energy\nI want to look a certain way and you\nwant to be able to do that for the\nduration of your life for a very long\nlife\nthis style of training where you\nincorporate all of those areas of\nendurance\ngives you all of the necessary\nadaptations one would need to execute\nall of those things remember\nfat loss or Weight Management\nis not best done with any individual\nstyle of protocol so if you do a little\nbit of all three of these you've checked\nthat fat loss box you don't need to go\nout and do anything separate for it\nyou've done all the things then to cover\nAesthetics\nfrom that side of the equation right\nyou've done the things to both enhance\nmitochondria\nto enhance blood flow increase\noxygenation and manage fatigue and waste\ndevelopment boom energy is there fatigue\nis there I'm not going to get tired or\nhave to quit or stop or sit down doing\nany of these activities I want at the\nsame time if you look at the literature\non mortality one of the strongest\npredictors of how long you're going to\nlive is your VO2 max\nso we've set up a scenario in which\nyou're going to hit all three of those\nprimary goals by doing a combination of\nthis training you're not going to miss\nany plausible adaptation from endurance\ntraining and you should be set for\nregardless of your goal\nincredible and as I understand totally\ncompatible with strength and hypertrophy\ntraining provided that your goal is to\nalso be strong\nand also selectively hypertrophy or\ngenerally hypertrophy your muscles or\nmaintain your muscles\nfor many people that are listening to\nthis I'm guessing that they have an\ninterest in building more endurance but\nnot just the ability to go further but\nthe ability to go a given distance at a\nhigher speed and to do it with better\nform and to breathe better and to feel\nbetter before during and after\nfor those folks maybe you could spell\nout a program that combines these\ndifferent elements of endurance\nand does so in a way that informs how\nfor instance the higher intensity short\nduration Sprints would be expected to\nimprove their longer duration work and\nhow perhaps their longer duration work\ncan progress if they are careful to\ninclude some planks and some wall sets\nand and things of that sort\nI asked this question specifically\nbecause I have to believe that while\nthere probably are some folks out there\nthey're looking to just maximize their\nplank from week to week to week\ntypically it seems that people fall into\nthese categories of either wanting to\nget stronger and get bigger muscles to\nvarying degrees or to get better at\nendurance or to get better at everything\noverall right now I'd really like to\njust focus on what you think is a nice\nContour of a program for the person that\nwants to get better at endurance but do\nit with more speed more stability and\njust feel like a strong endurance Runner\ncycle or swimmer or whatever happened to\nbe their endurance event okay great so\nlet's just give an example maybe you\nwant to run your first half marathon\nsomething like that okay or maybe done a\ncouple times before but you want to get\nbetter at that time I would probably put\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to\n70 percent of your you know mileage in\nthe moderate intensity Zone okay so you\nneed to accumulate mileage and you need\nto be able to handle what we call the\ntissue tolerance so in this case your\nfeet need to be able to handle 13 miles\nof pounding okay it doesn't matter how\nmuch high heart rate training you do or\nyour fat deliverability none of that\nmatters if your feet are blown up by\nmile eight Okay so\nin addition we talked about how even\ntraining in that 70 to 85 percent heart\nrate zone is quite effective at oxygen\ndelivery fat utilization capitalization\nEtc so you're going to get a lot of\ndirect endurance benefits from that work\nyou're also going to be working on\nwhat's honestly going to be one of your\nlimiting factors which is that tissue\ntolerance and that pounding okay in\naddition you need to be efficient with\nyour Technique and you need a lot of\nrepetitions for motor skill development\nso you want to spend most your time\nthere it's easy to recover from it's not\nextremely\ndemanding and challenging awesome that\nleaves you with another 30 or 40 percent\nof training I would spend 10 percent of\nthat in that like 20 second burst area\nyou're going to drive up fatigue\nextremely high and you're going to\nreally maximize your ability to recover\nfrom waste production all right great I\nwould spend the remaining amount of time\neither on a little bit of actually\nmaximum speed stuff\nthat could actually be in the 20 second\nburst if you're really trying to go as\nfast as you can\nat the beginning of that exercise\nand then the rest of it I would spend in\nthat other Zone which is more of like\nthe five to 15 minutes but you're\nprobably going to want to repeat those\nand this is when things like 800 meter\nrun rest for double the time\nand then repeat that two or three times\nyou actually need that in this scenario\nbecause you're gonna need to be able to\nbe running for two most people are gonna\ndo a half marathon and maybe around two\nhours or so something like that and so\nyou want a little bit of what we call\nrepeated endurance right so be able to\nhandle that higher heart rate come back\ndown do it again at the same time that's\nactually how you bump your mileage up\nso instead of having this do more of\nthese long duration distance runs you\ncan still get maybe five or six miles\ndown in a day if you're going to do a\none mile repeat\nor whatever number you're looking at so\nfor a lot of people that's kind of how I\nwould structure it um that's honestly\nit's very similar to what we laid out in\nthe previous conversation which is\ngetting to this idea that more than 50\npercent should be basically practice\na little bit of work at the very top end\nof the spectrum but not too much and\nthen a little bit of work at the other\nend and you should be in a good spot a\nmajor mistake one would make here is\nonly doing the long duration steady\nstate stuff and just sort of saying I'm\ngonna run a five mile this was a week\nand then do six miles next week and\nseven I said that might work for you\nit's I think we have enough evidence at\nthis point both in the scientific realm\nas well as most of the coaches I think\nin this space would agree with me is\nthat's a sub-optimal strategy so it\ncould work but we can do better and in\nterms of the structure of a program like\nthis I realize that those structures\nvary tremendously different coaches and\ndifferent books and different programs\nare going to say oh you should run\nMonday through Friday with weekends off\nor every other day but in terms of this\n70 percent\num thirty percent divide where seventy\npercent is going toward the specific\nevent you know doing the kind of work\nthat you're going to do during this\nspecific event that you're most\ninterested in cultivating or improving\nand the remaining 30 coming from other\nsorts of uh of supporting were work\nhow should one thing about Distributing\nthat other thirty percent should it be\nall geared towards maximizing recovery\nfor the 70 or in other words\num could I do all that 30 work on one\nday I probably would split it into two\ndays\num that's the reality is so if you're\nthinking man coach wants me to train six\ndays a week my schedule is tight I can\npull off four to five\nokay great what I might say is two of\nthose days are just your your tempo\nright this is what like a runner would\ncall this like Tempo training I'm kind\nof in that space remind us what tempo\ntraining is\n80 effort range where you're like\nrunning at probably the same stride\nlength and and rate that you're gonna\nrun your race at maybe a little bit\nlower but something similar you're\npracticing skill you're accruing mileage\nand you're getting a little you're\ngetting work in for sure work but it's\nnot absolutely the fastest you can\nSprint it's also not conversation so\nthis would be the um what before we\nrefer to as the 10 minutes of of fast\nrunning or ten minutes of fast run this\nis lower intensity than that got it this\nis uh\nthis is work accumulation got it this is\npractice stuff\num then one of the days a week I would\nprobably enter in that 22nd 30 second\nburst for a little bit of speed there\nand then one of the other days is when I\nwould do that true high intensity as\nhard as I can for hitting a VO2 max\nsomething like that so that's probably\nhow I'd break it up if I had like four\ndays a week if you had five you can\nmaybe add in another day where you do\nmore of that volume accumulation\npractice work but that's that's a pretty\ngood split well this is the point in the\nepisode where I say\nthank you ever so much you provided an\nenormous amount of incredibly\ninteresting clear information that's\nalso actionable\nI do feel as if I far better understand\nendurance in its many forms and even the\nseller underpinnings of that and even\nsub-seller underpinnings of what\nendurance adaptations are and how to\nFoster those through specific protocols\nthings that not only I can do tomorrow\nbut that I will do tomorrow and where I\nhit my pain points I'll understand\nwhat's happening and the adaptation that\nI'm triggering when my legs are burning\nor I'm sucking for air through my mouth\nor I can calmly move along just through\nnasal breathing I will now know what's\nhappening in my body and the specific\nadaptations that I'm triggering I think\nyou also highlight something that is\nvitally important and I've never heard\nit phrased as clearly as you did today\nwhich is that it really doesn't matter\nhow one seeks out to achieve fat loss\nprovided certain criteria are met\neven while certain forms of exercise tap\ninto fat stores more than others and you\nbeautifully Illustrated the relationship\nbetween energy utilization and breathing\nand the fact that we literally exhale\nfat to some extent of course\nso once again thank you thank you and\nthank you I know I'm not alone in um\nrecognizing this information as\nincredibly interesting and actionable\nand indeed I do plan to put it into\naction as I hope many of our listeners\nwill as well\nyet again the pleasure is actually all\nmine and uh I actually really appreciate\nthe fact that you let me go so far into\nmetabolism my PhD is in human\nbioenergetics so anytime I can go many\nhours into metabolism I get very excited\nand I don't typically get that leash\num in this format so I appreciate that I\nknow\nyou understand your audience will love\nthat hopefully Oh They'll love it and I\nthink that they'll especially love it\nbecause they understand that if one can\nwrap their head around even just a small\nfraction of the mechanisms that underlie\na given protocol it gives both\ntremendous depth and meaning to that\nprotocol and makes it so much more\nflexible for people they can really\nthink about what's happening as they're\nengaging in a given protocol and know\nexactly what they can expect in terms of\nresults Great we've been on a bit of a\njourney here we've covered a lot of\nground with speed development and\nstrength and hypertrophy and now we walk\nthrough you know probably several hours\nhere of of endurance what I would love\nto do next is to just give you a more\nstraightforward\nnot as much background not as much\nmetabolism none of the mechanisms right\ninto protocols for someone who says look\nI want to hit those marks you keep\ntalking about I want to look good I want\nto feel good and I want to do that\nacross my lifespan how would I build all\nthese things into a protocol that\nactually covers maybe the entire year\nand how would I would be able to repeat\nthat year after year so I almost have\nthis Evergreen sustainable year-long\nperiodization structure that covers all\nthe nodes I need to if I want everything\nwe've talked about in these nine\nadaptations in this short
