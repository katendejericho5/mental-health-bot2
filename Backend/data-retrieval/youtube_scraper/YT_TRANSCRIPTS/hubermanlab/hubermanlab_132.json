get\nto answering your questions.\nAnd as always, I will strive\nto be as accurate as possible,\nas thorough as possible, and\nyet as concise as possible.\nThe first question today\nis about adaptogens.\nSome of you may have\nheard of adaptogens.\nI'm guessing many of you\nhave not heard of adaptogens.\nThe strict definition of\nadaptogens is still evolving.\nMeaning, no one really\nknows what adaptogens mean\nand what's included\nin adaptogens\nand what's excluded\nfrom adaptogens.\nBut the most common\ndefinition of an adaptogen\nis a compound that is typically\na supplement or a drug.\nAlthough, it could be a\nbehavior, if you really\nthink about it, that helps you\nadapt to and buffer stress.\nSo when you hear\nabout adaptogens,\nthere are three main\ncategories of adaptogens\nthat come to mind.\nThe first are things that\nare contained in food.\nSo these would be\nvitamins or micronutrients\nthat one could\neasily find in food.\nBut one would have to consume\na fairly restricted number\nor type of foods in order\nto obtain those things,\nor consume a lot of\nthose foods in order\nto get sufficient dosages\nof those adaptogen compounds\nin order to buffer stress.\nSome good examples\nof these would\nbe any kind of vitamin, either\nwater-soluble or fat-soluble,\nthat can adjust or reduce what\nare so-called reactive oxygen\nspecies.\nAnd then that's what\ngives rise to this idea\nthat antioxidants\nare good for us.\nNow, over the last 10 years\nor so, there's been a shift.\nWhat shift has occurred?\nWell, about 10 years\nago, you often heard\nabout antioxidants,\nantioxidants, antioxidants\nand vitamins,\nantioxidants in this food,\nthis superfood, et cetera.\nAnd why were people\ntalking about antioxidants?\nWell, just to remind you,\nreactive oxygen species\nare types of reactions\nand molecules\nthat occur in cells when\ncells get stressed and/or age.\nAnd antioxidants\nare the compounds\nthat reduce those\nreactive oxygen species.\nReactive oxygen species\nare bad for cells\nbecause they tend to hinder\nthe function of mitochondria,\nwhich are associated with energy\nproduction in those cells.\nSo what do we know for sure?\nWe know that as cells\nget older, or as any cell\nor biological\nsystem organ tissue,\net cetera, get stressed\na lot over time,\nthe number of reactive\noxygen species\nincreases in those cells\nand tissues and organs.\nAnd antioxidants, which can\ninclude certain vitamins\nbut also some\nmicronutrients, are\neffective in reducing those\nreactive oxygen species.\nNow, what's occurred\nover the last 10 years\nis that we know that\nreactive oxygen species are\na major source of depleting\ncellular function by way\nof depleting\nmitochondrial function.\nBut they are just one\nof many mechanisms\nthat can deplete\ncellular function\nmitochondrial function.\nSo nowadays, you'll hear\nabout reactive oxygen species\nand antioxidants, but not\nas much as you used to.\nNow, you hear a lot more\nabout inflammatory responses\nand inflammatory cytokines\nalso being an issue.\nAnd the truth is all of\nthese things are an issue.\nSo going back to this\nquestion about adaptogens,\nadaptogens include\nthese three categories.\nI've told you the first,\nwhich are the vitamins\nand micronutrients that\nare contained in food that\ncan reduce reactive\noxygen species\nand other aspects\nof cell or stress,\nsuch as inflammatory cytokines.\nWhat are some of those\nthings that occur in foods?\nWell, in order to\nanswer that, let's\njust think about what\nsorts of foods, themselves,\ncan act as adaptogens.\nIt's commonly held that the\ndark, leafy greens type foods,\nfor those of you\nthat eat plants.\nAnd I think the majority of\npeople out there do eat plants.\nI know that the\ncarnivore diet and lion\ndiet and some other diets\ntend to exclude plants,\nand we'll address that\nbriefly at some point\nin today's discussion.\nBut dark, leafy greens\nare known to contain\na number of compounds\nin the form of vitamins\nand micronutrients that are\nvery effective in reducing\nreactive oxygen species\nand inflammatory cytokines.\nSo if you're somebody\nwho's interested\nin adaptogens and adaptogenic\nprocesses, reducing\nstress and buffering stress,\nwhich, of course, has\nits role in buffering\ndaily stress in order\nto help you sleep\nbetter to improve\ncellular function for\nlongevity sports performance,\ncognitive performance,\nthat is all good\nand it makes sense\nwhy people would\nbe interested in adaptogens.\nBut remember that the\ntwo main adaptogens\nthat you should think\nto first are going\nto be behaviors and nutrition.\nI started with\nnutrition on purpose.\nAs I mentioned, we'll get\nto behaviors in a moment.\nSo if you're interested\nin adaptogens at all,\nI highly recommend that\nyou include at least two\nto four servings of\ndark, leafy greens\nand/or cruciferous\nvegetables per day.\nI think that would be\nhighly advantageous.\nAnd just be aware that\nexcessively heating dark,\nleafy greens or\ncruciferous vegetables\ncan actually destroy\nthe very nutrients\nand micronutrients that\nact in an adaptogenic way.\nThat does not mean that you\nneed to eat raw broccoli\nor cauliflower, just the thought\nof that makes me nauseous,\nit's very hard to digest.\nSome people might like that\nor can digest it more easily\nthan others.\nSo it's perfectly fine\nto cook your cruciferous\nvegetables and\ndark leafy greens,\nbut you don't want\nto overcook them.\nWhat's overcooking and\nwhat's undercooking?\nThere's no strict cutoff\nin terms of temperature.\nBut basically,\nwhat the literature\nsays is that if you heat\nvegetables to the point\nwhere the colored\nfluid is leaching out\nof them into a broth\ntype, into water\nor whatever fluid surrounds\nthem, well, then you\nwould be well off to ingest\nthat fluid as well because it\ncontained in the water or\nthe fluid that's leaching out\nfrom the cruciferous vegetables\nor from the dark leafy greens,\nare going to be a lot of those\nvery adaptogenic molecules\nthat you're interested\nin the first place.\nOK.\nSo I probably\nsurprised some people\nby starting off my answer\nto the question of \"What\nare adaptogens?\nAre they worth thinking\nabout in pursuing?\nAnd if so, how can I get\nthem?\" by talking about food.\nBut I think it is important\nto understand that you can get\na lot of adaptogens from food.\nAnd indeed, some of\nthe best adaptogens\ndo come from dark leafy greens\nand cruciferous vegetables.\nSo I'd be remiss if I\ndidn't mention that.\nThe other two\ncategories of adaptogens\nare going to be supplement-based\nadaptogens and then\nbehavioral adaptogens.\nAgain, here adaptogen\ndefined as anything\nthat can buffer stress in a\nsubstantial or meaningful way\nin order to support\ncellular health, organ\nhealth, and overall daily\nliving and functioning,\nincluding sleep and\nperformance in mental health.\nSo the second\ncategory of adaptogens\nare going to be supplements.\nAnd here, again, I just\nwant to take a step back,\nmake sure that we\nare clear about\nour operational definition\nabout what a supplement is.\nWe had an episode all about\nhow to design a rational guide\nto supplementation,\nwhich included,\nfor example, the idea\nthat for some people,\nthe optimal dosage\nof many supplements\nis going to be zero.\nAnd for other people, the\ndosage will be something else.\nBut to really pinpoint the\nkey message from that episode\nthat I'd like to reiterate\nnow, but a key message\nfrom that episode that\nI'd like to reiterate now\nis that many people\nthink of supplements\nas just vitamin supplements.\nAnd for that\nreason, you'll often\nhear the argument, \"Oh,\nwell, aren't supplements just\nexpensive urine.\nCouldn't you get all\nof that from food?\"\nAren't you just urinating out\nall the water-soluble vitamins\nand maybe even\nstoring excess amounts\nof the fat-soluble vitamins\nin a way that's unhealthy\nor not cost-effective?\"\nAnd so on.\nWhen we talk about\nsupplements, yes, it\ncan include vitamin supplements.\nHowever, there\nare many compounds\nthat we would describe as\nsupplements that are not\nvitamin supplements, and that\nyou could not obtain from food\nor that you could\nnever obtain from food\nin sufficient enough\nqualities to have\na robust positive biological\neffect without consuming\nan enormous number of calories\nor overriding your gut\nmechanically.\nFor instance, if there\nwere, say, a herb, and we'll\ntalk about such\nherbs in a moment,\nthat contained an\neffective adaptogen,\nbut you would never\nwant to eat the plant\nitself or include that\nherb in any kind of recipe,\nwell then, chances\nare this herb, which\nwe'll define in a moment,\nis not a vitamin supplement.\nIt is probably not even best\nthought of as a supplement,\nit's best thought\nof as a compound\nthat sold over the counter,\nmuch like a prescription drug.\nAlthough, it's not prescription.\nIt doesn't require a\nprescription to get it.\nSo there are a lot of\nthings like that we\ninclude under the umbrella\nof this word supplements.\nAnd unfortunately, because\nof that, a lot of people\nthink, \"Oh, you don't\nneed supplements.\"\nAnd, of course, you don't\nneed supplements per se,\nbut many people do derive\ntremendous benefit from them.\nIn the context of\nadaptogens, there\nare two or three\nin particular that\ncan be very beneficial\nfor buffering the stress\nresponse, especially,\nover short periods of time\nof about two to three weeks.\nSo when would you use these?\nWell, for instance, if you are\nin a particularly stressful\nmode of life, either because of\nfamily or relational or school\nor work demands or\nnew kid in the house\nor-- any number of different\nthings, or you've been ill\nor you're recovering\nfrom injury,\ntaking an adaptogen in\nthe form of a supplement\ncan actually be very useful\nfor buffering this hormone\nand the general system\nis associated with,\ncalled cortisol.\nIt's very healthy\nto have high levels\nof cortisol early in the day,\nshortly after you wake up.\nAnd then that ought to taper\noff toward the afternoon\nand evening.\nHowever, if cortisol\nis chronically\nelevated throughout the day,\nor if that peak in cortisol\nis arriving too late\nin the day, that\nis known to be associated\nwith mental health\nand physical health issues.\nHas been shown by labs at\nStanford and elsewhere.\nIt's been shown in animal\nmodels and in humans.\nTalked many times before, and\nI'll just remind you again.\nOne of the best ways to\nrestrict that cortisol peak\nto the early part of the day\nis to get morning sunlight\nin your eyes as soon as you can.\nOnce the sun is up,\nget outside face\nin the direction of the\nsun, even on overcast days.\nDon't wear sunglasses, look\nat it for five to 30 minutes.\nDefinitely blink so you\ndon't damage your eyes,\nso on and so forth.\nWhy five minutes or 30 minutes?\nWell, five minutes on a clear\nday should be sufficient,\nlonger would be fine.\nAgain, blink so that\nyou protect your eyes.\nBlink as needed.\nFace in the general\ndirection of the sun.\nOn days when you have a lot of\novercast or it's really dark,\ndense cloud cover,\nwell, then, you'd\nwant to be outside longer.\nAnd if you don't have access to\nsunlight for whatever reason,\nthen you want to\ndo the same thing\nwith bright artificial lights\nindoors, either so-called SAD\nlamp or otherwise.\nThat's a great way to\nrestrict that cortisol peak\nto early in the day.\nBut even if you're\ndoing that, if you\nhave a stressful life\nfor whatever reason,\neven if you're getting that\nmorning sunlight, which I hope\nyou are, you're\ngetting your exercise,\nyou're trying to sleep\nbetter and more as we all\nshould most of the\ntime, well, then you\nmay be somebody who\nwants to take a adaptogen\nin the form of a supplement.\nAnd the three\nsupplements that can\nbe very effective in\nbuffering cortisol\nare ashwagandha, which I'll\ntalk about first, lion's mane\nand chaga.\nLion's mane and chaga\nare in the fungi group,\nso they count as mushrooms.\nThey are not\npsychedelic mushrooms.\nLet's talk about\nashwagandha first.\nAshwagandha is at\nthe top of the list\nbecause it is indeed a\nvery potent adaptogen.\nHow can I say that?\nWell, there are a\nnumber of studies\nnow, including\nseveral excellent ones\nin humans, that\nreport that taking\ntwo doses of 300 milligrams\nof ashwagandha per day\ncan, very dramatically,\nbuffer cortisol.\nSo this is something\nthat you would\nhave a near-impossible\ntime accessing from food.\nI can't imagine\nthat, unless you're\ncooking with the very\nsources of ashwagandha\nand extracting exact\namounts that you'd\nbe able to get this in any other\nform except supplement form.\nSo here I'm going to just\nbriefly reference a paper\nand we can provide a reference\nlink to this, that is.\nThis is a paper\nfrom 2012 that's had\na lot of excellent follow-up\npapers that support it.\nThe title of the paper is\nA prospective randomized\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled\nstudy of safety and efficacy\nof high concentration\nof full spectrum\nextract of ashwagandha\nroot in reducing\nstress and anxiety in adults.\nAnd it's a really nice study.\nNot a huge subject pool,\nbut both men and women, and\nhas carried out for\nlong enough that they\ngot to see some really\ninteresting results.\nAnd I think the most\ninteresting result\nis that taking 300 milligrams\nof ashwagandha twice a day\nled to enormous--\nI mean, just enormous\nchanges in serum cortisol.\nThe statistical significance\nthat they observed in the study\nwas really fantastic,\nfantastically high\nstatistical significance.\nThey saw the effects of\nashwagandha on day 15,\nhaving initiated the ashwagandha\nconsumption on day one,\nof course, day 30 and day 45.\nAnd again, this was\ndramatic reductions\nin stress as\nperceived by people.\nSo subjective stress\nand cortisol levels.\nSo ashwagandha is very\npotent at reducing cortisol.\nHow would you\nrecapitulate this if you\nwanted to use ashwagandha\nto buffer stress?\nWell, a couple of key points.\nI mentioned earlier that\nyou want your cortisol peak\nto come earlier in the day.\nTherefore, you would\nnot want to buffer\ncortisol early in the day.\nIn fact, cortisol\npeaking early in the day\nprovides an anti-inflammatory\nimmune-supporting, focus\nand mood supporting\neffect all day long.\nSo I would recommend\nthat people take\ntheir first dose of ashwagandha\nanywhere from 250 to 300\nmilligrams.\nSometime in the early afternoon\nand again in the evening,\nas opposed to taking a morning\ndose in an afternoon dose.\nAlso, if you're somebody\nwho's exercising\nfor sake of trying to induce\nadaptations like hypertrophy,\nthe growth of\nmuscles or strength,\nor improve your\nendurance in any way,\nmuscular endurance or more\ntraditional cardiovascular\nendurance, then I recommend that\nyou not take your ashwagandha\nprior to exercise because part\nof the adaptation response\nis triggered by increases\nin cortisol during exercise.\nSort of in the same way\nthat some of the best\nadaptations to exercise are\nreductions in blood pressure\nand resting heart rate.\nAnd those are stimulated by\nincreases in blood pressure\nand increases in heart\nrate during exercise.\nThat's just how these\nbiological systems work.\nSo the takeaway\nis pretty simple.\nIf you're interested in using\nashwagandha as an adaptogen,\nI would restrict it\nto later in the day\nif you can and not\nbefore exercise.\nDivide it into two doses\nof 250 to 300 milligrams.\nThat's what this\npaper and other papers\nlike it seem to indicate.\nAnd then a very important\nfinal point about ashwagandha,\nwhich is that if you're\ngoing to take ashwagandha,\nI recommend not taking it for\nlonger than a month-and-a-half\nas they did in this study.\nIn fact, I would\nsuggest that you only\ntake ashwagandha around periods\nof moderate to extreme stress.\nWhat's moderate,\nwhat's extreme is\ngoing to depend on what\nyou're going through.\nOnly how much stress and\nlife events you can tolerate.\nSo if you've had trouble\nsleeping and that's\nunusual for you.\nOr, you're dealing with a very\ndifficult life circumstances\nor excessive work demand, or a\nnew kid, as I mentioned before.\nWell, then buffering\nstress with ashwagandha,\nbuffering cortisol in\nthe afternoon and evening\ncan be very beneficial for you.\nBut then I would say after\nabout 30 days maximum,\nI would take at least\ntwo to four weeks off.\nTwo weeks is probably\nenough, but four weeks off\nbecause you don't want to\nchronically buffer cortisol.\nIt's just not a good idea.\nBut that said, I\nthink ashwagandha\nis a very powerful\nadaptogen. I would\nplace at the top of the list\nof supplement-based adaptogens.\nBut keep in mind\nthat even if you're\ntaking a supplement-based\nadaptogen,\nthat's no reason to abandon the\nnutrition and behavioral type\nadaptogenic effects that you\ncan create through eating\ndark leafy greens,\ncruciferous vegetables,\nthen we'll talk about the\nbehaviors in a moment.\nThe other two supplement-based\nadaptogens, as I mentioned,\nare lion's mane\nmushroom and chaga.\nAnd I get asked a lot about\nlion's mane and chaga for sake\nof their purported roles in\nacting as nootropics as quote\nunquote \"smart drugs.\"\nThere are fewer data\non the beneficial roles\nof lion's mane and chaga for\nsake of nootropic effects--\nwe'll do an entire episode\non nootropics at some point.\nBut there have been\na few studies showing\nthat lion's made in\nsupplementation and chaga\nsupplementation\ncan improve memory,\nand maybe even\ndivergent thinking\nassociated with creativity\nand things of that sort.\nAgain, these are not\npsychedelic mushrooms.\nThat said, there are good data\nshowing that 1,000 milligrams,\nthat is 1 gram, of lion's\nmane per day and/or--\nI will talk about the\nend/or portion in a moment,\nand/or chaga mushroom at 500\nto 1,500 milligrams per day\ncan act as adaptogens in,\nagain, reducing cortisol.\nBut also and mainly reducing\nsome of the anti-inflammatory\ncytokines that are known to\ncirculate in high abundance\nwhen you're under a lot of\npsychological and/or physical\nstress.\nThings like interleukin 6\nand some related molecules.\nSo here's what I\nwould recommend.\nIf you are interested\nin exploring adaptogens,\nI'm a big fan, as\nsome of you probably\nknow, if you heard that\nepisode on rational guide\nto supplementation.\nI'm a big fan of mainly\nfocusing on taking supplements\nin single-ingredient\nformulations\nso that you can figure out\nwhat dosages are best for you,\nand so that you can toggle in\nand out those adaptogens as\nneeded.\nSo I, of course,\nam a fan of taking\ncertain blends and mixes,\nthe one that we talk\nabout a lot on this\npodcast and we have been\na sponsor from the beginning,\nI've taken for a decade\nnow long before I\never had a podcast,\nis Athletic Greens, which\nsome of you might note\ndoes contain some ashwagandha.\nAlthough, the levels\nof ashwagandha\nthat are contained\nin Athletic Greens\nare low enough that I don't see\nany issue with taking Athletic\nGreens consistently, day to\nday, every day, because you're\nnot getting anywhere near\nthat 600-milligram dosage.\nBut the idea is that\nif you were going\nto take any adaptogen for\nsake of buffering stress\nover the short term, say for a\nweek or two weeks or a month,\nand then taking that\nrecommended time off,\nI would start with ashwagandha.\nAnd then if you feel you\nneed something else to buffer\nstress, keeping in\nmind, of course,\nthat you're doing the behavioral\nand the nutritional things\nto buffer stress as well.\nYou can never\nabandon those, right?\nWell, then I would suggest\nadding 1,000 milligrams\nor 1,000 milligrams\nof chaga per day\nand seeing how that further\nbenefits your system in terms\nof buffering stress.\nHow would you measure if\nyour stress is being reduced?\nWell, you're going to be\nsleeping better at night.\nYou're going to feel\nsubjectively better, lower\nlevels of anxiety.\nAll the things that are\nmeasured in the types of studies\nI described before.\nNow, of course, there's\nnothing preventing you\nfrom taking 600\nmilligrams of ashwagandha,\na gram of lion's mane,\nand a gram of chaga.\nI know some people\nlike to just kind of go\nfull tilt into everything.\nBut I am a big believer in\nreally trying to isolate which\nsupplements and molecules work\nbest for you and which ones\ndon't.\nDo you need to cycle on and\noff lion's mane and chaga?\nI'm not aware of any\ndata showing that you do.\nIf, however, you're\ntaking them every day,\nI recommend that you cycle off\nthem after a period of 30 days\nor so.\nAnd I want to be very\nclear about this,\njust because I said cycle\noff after a period of 30 days\nor so does not mean\nthat you can't take them\nfor a shorter period of time.\nSo for instance, if you\nknow that you're coming up\non a big week of\nstress, well, then you\ncould take ashwagandha and/or\nlion's mane and/or chaga\nfor that week or just that\nweek or heading into that week\nor in the following\nweek and then stop.\nThere's no reason why you\ncouldn't take them even just\nfor one day.\nAlthough, the effects tend to\nbe a bit cumulative, at least,\nwhen we're talking\nabout buffering anxiety.\nIn terms of buffering\ncortisol, that's\na very potent effect\nthat as far as we know,\nis going to take\nplace on day one.\nAgain, keep that cortisol\nbuffering effect away\nfrom exercise.\nAt least, don't take\nit before exercise.\nAnd try and buffer your cortisol\nin the afternoon and evening,\nand this is assuming that you're\nworking a conventional shift\nand you're not up all\nnight and sleeping\nall day for sake of shift work.\nSo hopefully, that\nclarifies things\nabout what adaptogens are.\nIn fact, I never actually\nread the specific question,\nbut I think I've touched\non a number of issues\nthat were related to\nthe specific question.\nAnd then I'll answer the\nlast portion of the answer\nto this question\nin a moment, as it\nrelates to behavioral tools\nthat can act as adaptogens.\nThe question,\nitself, was there's\na lot of mixed information\nout there about adaptogens\nlike ashwagandha.\nAnd I think that relates to\nwhat I said earlier, which\nis that the definition\nof an adaptogen\nhas not really been cemented\nin various communities.\nIt's different in\ndifferent communities,\nand it's generally used\nas a matter of convenience\nrather than really strictly\ndefining what it is.\nAnd hopefully, we've defined it\naccurately and broadly enough\ntoday as something\nthat buffers stress.\nThe second part of\nthe question was\nwhat does the scientific\nevidence say about adaptogens\nand their ability to mediate\nbody stress response?\nThey say quite a\nlot, and they say\nthat the stress response can\nbe buffered substantially\nby certain adaptogens.\nMainly, dark leafy greens,\ncruciferous vegetables,\nashwagandha, lion's\nmane, and chaga,\nand of course, all\nthe behavioral things\nthat are critical that I\nwill list off in a moment.\nAnd then the third\nportion of the question\nis, is there any\nsolid evidence that\nhas an effect on\nneurotransmitters or the HPA,\nwhich is part of the\nstress modulation access?\nThe best evidence is that\nadaptogens can reduce cortisol\nitself.\nThere is very little evidence\nthat adaptogens can directly\nmodulate neurotransmitters or\nneuromodulators like dopamine,\nserotonin, et cetera.\nBut by adjusting the timing\nand levels of cortisol,\nespecially in the\nafternoon and evening,\nthat is going to have\nindirect effects on levels\nof dopamine, norepinephrine,\net cetera, and serotonin.\nBut not direct effects.\nSo the general contour that\nmakes for an ideal diurnal\nschedule-- you heard\nof nocturnal, well,\nthe opposite that is diurnal,\nbeing awake during the daytime\nand asleep at night.\nThe ideal kind of landscape\nof neurotransmitters\nis higher levels of dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, and epinephrine\nin the early part of\nthe day and cortisol,\nso-called catecholamines,\ndopamine, norepinephrine,\nand epinephrine.\nAnd high levels of cortisol\nearly in the day as\ndirected by sunlight, exercise,\ncaffeine, hydration, movement,\nall that stuff, being\nawake and busy and outside\nor indoors with bright\nlights and moving\nabout in the early\npart of the day\nand into the early afternoon,\nthat's the best possible way\nthat we are aware\nof to try and get\nthose catecholamines\nreleased at the highest\nlevels in the early\npart of the day.\nAnd then the ideal\ncontour of a 24-hour cycle\nwill be in the later\nhalf of the day.\nThe evening and nighttime,\nyou have higher levels\nof things like serotonin\nthe GABAergic system,\nall the things that are somewhat\nsedative in preparing you\nfor sleep and lower levels of\nthe catecholamines and cortisol\nas I described before.\nSo to directly\nanswer the question,\n\"Is there any evidence\nthat adaptogens can\nalter your neurotransmitters?\"\nYes, but only indirectly.\nAnd yet, that indirect\ncontrol over neurotransmitters\nis substantial and is important.\nAnd if you do what I described,\nsuch as getting morning\nsunlight and ideally, you'd\nget a little bit of deliberate\ncold water exposure,\nby the way, to boost\nadrenaline and\nnorepinephrine and dopamine,\nthose catecholamines\nearly in the day.\nSo quick one-minute\ncold shower, even\nor a three-minute cold shower,\nor if you have access to an ice\nbath early in the day,\nplus some sunlight,\ndoesn't matter which\none you do first,\ndoing that early in\nthe day is really\ngoing to create that peak of\ncortisol, dopamine, epinephrine\nearly in the day.\nI can't emphasize how\nbeneficial all of that can be.\nAnd exercise, if you can,\nearly end of the day.\nSome people can't exercise\ntill later in the day.\nI'd rather see people\nexercise later in the day\nthan not at all,\nprovided it does not\ndisrupt their nighttime\nsleep, which of course, sleep\nis the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nSo yes, there is modulation\nof neurotransmitters,\nbut most of those are downstream\nof the effects on cortisol\nthat we've been talking about.\nSo we've defined\nnutritional adaptogens,\nsupplement-based adaptogens--\nalthough, I don't really\nlike the word\nsupplements anymore\nunless we're talking\nabout vitamin supplements\nfor reasons we\ntalked about earlier.\nAnd then there's\nthe third category\nof adaptogens, which are the\nbehavioral tools that you\ncan use to buffer\nstress, which qualifies\nthose as an adaptogen. I think\nit's really important that we\nalways keep in mind that\nyes, there are supplements,\nyes, there are prescription\ndrugs out there.\nIn fact, there are\nprescription drugs\nthat you can get from a\ndoctor that will potently\nzero out your cortisol.\nBut most doctors are very\nreluctant to prescribe\nthose drugs because\ncortisol provides\na very important and functional\nrole early in the day.\nBehaviors are very effective\nat reducing cortisol.\nWhat are the most effective\nbehaviors to reduce cortisol?\nWell, we talked about,\none, to restrict cortisol\nthe early part of the day, which\nis viewing morning sunlight.\nBut how would you buffer\ncortisol in the late afternoon?\nIt's going to be all\nthe things associated\nwith reducing stress.\nFor instance, 10\nminutes or even--\nmy laboratory and other\nlaboratories have shown\nis even five minutes\na day of just what\nwould be called mindfulness\nmeditation, very simple.\nYou don't need to\novercomplicate this.\nYou could use a great app\nlike the Waking Up app\nor another app of the sort.\nOr, you can simply\nsit down, eyes\nclosed, breathe\nthrough your nose,\nand just concentrate\non your breathing.\nEvery time your mind\ndrifts to something else,\nbring it back to your breathing.\nThat's shown to reduce stress.\nYou could do a five-minute\ndeliberate breath work\npractice.\nMy laboratory has published\nsome work related to that.\nThe breath work practice\ncould be any number of things.\nThe two that I\nrecommend the most\nwould be double inhale,\nfollowed by a full exhale,\nand then repeat for a\nperiod of five minutes.\nKnown to substantially\nreduce anxiety, stress,\nand the various\nphysiological systems\nassociated with arousal.\nYou could also\nuse box breathing,\ninhale, hold, exhale,\nhold for equal durations\nfor a period of five\nminutes, will substantially\nreduce stress.\nI'm a big fan, as many of\nyou know, of yoga nidra,\nwhich involves no movement.\nIt involves just lying\nthere, listening to a script.\nLots of yoga or scripts\navailable online.\nIf you're not interested in the\nintentions and other things,\nincluding yoga nidra,\nyou can buffer stress\nusing an adaptogen like\nNSDR, non-sleep deep breast.\nIf you're interested in\ntrying these sorts of things.\nThere's a NSDR protocol\nthat's 10 minutes long.\nJust put my name,\nHuberman, and NSDR\ninto the search\nbrowser on YouTube.\nAnd Virtusan is provided in\nNSDR that's completely zero cost\nand works very well\nfor reducing stress.\nIt will also help\nteach your system\nand teach you how to learn to\nfall asleep better at night.\nSo any of those practices, five\nto 10-minute breathing practice\nor meditation, or\na NSDR yoga nidra.\nIf you can do longer 20 or\n30 minutes in the afternoon,\nthat's known to buffer\ncortisol substantially as well.\nAny time you're encountering\nstress in real time,\nI highly recommend\na tool over and over\nbecause it's so effective.\nThe fastest way we to\nbuffer stress and calm down\nis the so-called\nphysiological sigh,\nbig Inhale through the nose till\nyour lungs are empty, but then\nsneak in a little bit\nmore air by second inhale,\nmaximally inflate\nthe lungs, then\na long exhale until\nyou're lungs are empty.\nOne to three of those\nwill reduce your stress\nsubstantially.\nOver time that should\nreduce, that is, buffer\nyour cortisol acting\nas an adaptogen.\nThere are a lot of things.\nYou can take a hot bath,\nyou could take a hot shower,\nyou can listen to\nsome pleasant music.\nAnything that reduces\nyour stress, technically,\nis an adaptogen. So I hope\nI've thoroughly answered\nyour question by yours--\nI mean, of course, this answer\nis going out to all of you.\nThis is a question that was\nasked by Justine Bevilacqua.\nI hope I pronounced\nthat correctly, Justine.\nAnd thank you for that question.\nI think there are\na lot of people\ninterested in adaptogens.\nSo now, you can use nutrition\nsuch as cruciferous vegetables,\ndark leafy greens.\nAnd I should also\nmention, if you're not\ningesting enough\ncalories each day, well,\nthen you are going to be\nin a mild mode of stress.\nThat's not to say that some\npeople shouldn't take in fewer\ncalories than they burn\nin order to lose weight,\nsome people really need to\ndo that for their health\nor for whatever other reason.\nBut if you restrict\ncalories too much,\nyou are going to\nincrease cortisol output.\nSo keep that in mind.\nSo ingest sufficient calories\nfor you and for your goals.\nAim to get dark leafy greens\nand cruciferous vegetables,\ndon't overcook them.\nIf you want to\nexplore supplements,\nthe best supplements\nto act as adaptogens\nare going to be ashwagandha,\nlion's mane, and chaga.\nOne or two or three of\nthose-- although, if you're\ngoing to pick one, I'd recommend\nashwagandha, 600 milligrams\nper day, taken in the\nlater-half of the day.\nAnd then there are\nthe behavioral tools\nthat we just talked about now,\nwhich are anything that reduces\nstress can reduce cortisol.\nAnd in doing so, are\ntechnically adaptogens.\nIf you want to know\nmore behavioral tools\nand other tools for\nadjusting stress\nand learn more\nabout adaptogens, we\ndid a whole episode\ncalled Mastering Stress.\nSo you can look to\nthat-- that episode also\npretty clearly defines, I like\nto think, what short-term,\nmedium-term, and long-term\nstress really are.\nKeep in mind, stress\nis part of life.\nLearning how to work with\nit, how to dance with it,\nhow to buffer it is terrific.\nBut zeroing out cortisol\nis not the goal.\nThe goal is to learn to modulate\nand control your cortisol,\nand that's really what\nadaptogens are all about.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this ask-me-anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nask-me-anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which,\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to change\nthe format or anything\nabout the standard\nHuberman Lab podcast,\nand to fund research in\nparticular research done\non human beings.\nSo not animal models,\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree is the species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to,\nspecifically, fund research\nthat is aimed toward\ndeveloping further protocols\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels.\nNot just the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast and\nother media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do a\ndollar-for-dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools, for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for\nthe Human Lab premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMA's.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nAnd you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMA's and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab\npodcast episodes,\nand not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
