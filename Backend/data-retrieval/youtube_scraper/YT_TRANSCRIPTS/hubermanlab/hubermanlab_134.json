    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is\nDr. Sam Harris.\nDr. Sam Harris did his\nundergraduate training\nin philosophy at\nStanford University\nand then went on to do his\ndoctorate in neuroscience\nat the University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles.\nHe is well known\nas an author who\nhas written about\neverything from meditation\nto consciousness, free will.\nAnd he holds many\nstrong political views\nthat he's voiced on social\nmedia and in the content\nof various books as they relate\nto philosophy and neuroscience.\nDuring today's\nepisode, I mainly talk\nto Dr. Harris about his\nviews and practices related\nto meditation,\nconsciousness, and free will.\nIn fact, he made\nseveral important points\nabout what a proper meditation\npractice can accomplish.\nPrior to this episode, I\nthought that meditation\nwas about deliberately changing\none's conscious experience\nin order to achieve\nthings such as deeper\nrelaxation, a heightened\nsense of focus or ability\nto focus generally,\nelevated memory, and so on.\nWhat Sam taught me and what\nyou'll soon learn as well\nis that while\nmeditation does indeed\nhold all of those\nvaluable benefits,\nthe main value of a\nmeditation practice,\nor perhaps the greater value\nof a meditation practice,\nis that it doesn't\njust allow one\nto change their\nconscious experience,\nbut it actually can\nallow a human being\nto view consciousness itself.\nThat is to understand what the\nprocess of consciousness is.\nAnd in doing so, to\nprofoundly shift the way\nthat one engages with the\nworld and with oneself\nin all practices, all\nenvironments, and at all times,\nboth in sleep and\nin waking states.\nAnd in that way\nmaking meditation\nperhaps the most potent\nand important portal\nby which one can access novel\nways of thinking and being\nand viewing one's\nlife experience.\nWe also discussed the so-called\nmind-body problem and issues\nof duality and free will.\nConcepts from philosophy and\nneuroscience that, fortunately,\nthanks to valuable experiments\nand deep thinking on the part\nof people like Dr.\nSam Harris and others,\nis now leading people to\nunderstand really what free\nwill is and isn't.\nWhere the locus of free will\nlikely sits in the brain,\nif it indeed resides\nin the brain at all.\nAnd what it means to\nbe a conscious being\nand how we can modify our\nconscious states in ways that\nallow us to be more functional.\nWe also discuss perception,\nboth visual perception auditory\nperception, and especially\ninteresting to me,\nand I think as well, hopefully\nto you, time perception,\nwhich we know is very\nelastic in the brain.\nThe literal frame\nrate by which we\nprocess our conscious experience\ncan expand and contract\ndramatically depending\non our state of mind\nand how conscious we are\nabout our state of mind.\nSo we went deep into\nthat topic as well.\nToday's discussion was indeed\nan intellectual deep dive\ninto all the topics that I\nmentioned a few moments ago,\nbut it also included\nmany practical tools.\nIn fact, I pushed\nSam to share with us\nwhat his specific practices\nare and how we can all\narrive at a clearer and better\nunderstanding of a meditation\npractice that we can\neach and all apply.\nSo that we can derive these\nincredible benefits, not just\nthe ones related to stress\nand focus and enhanced memory,\nbut the ones that relate\nto our consciousness.\nThat is to our deeper sense\nof self and to others.\nSeveral times during\ntoday's episode,\nI mentioned the Waing Up app.\nThe Waking Up app was\ndeveloped by Sam Harris,\nbut I want to emphasize that my\nmention of the app is in no way\na paid promotional.\nRather the Waking Up\napp is one that I've\nused for some period of time\nnow and find very, very useful.\nI have family members\nthat also use it.\nOther staff members here\nat the Huberman Lab podcast\nuse it because we find it\nto be such a powerful tool.\nSam has generously offered\nHuberman Lab podcast listeners\na 30-day completely free\ntrial of the Waking Up app.\nIf any of you want to\ntry it, you can simply go\nto wakingup.com/huberman to\nget that 30-day free trial.\nDuring today's\ndiscussion, we didn't just\ntalk about meditation\nconsciousness and free will.\nWe also talked\nabout psychedelics.\nBoth their therapeutic\napplications for the treatment\nof things like\ndepression and PTSD,\nbut also the use\nof psychedelics.\nAnd we discussed Sam's\nexperiences with psychedelics\nas they relate to expanding\none's consciousness.\nI also asked Sam about\nhis views and practices\nrelated to social media.\nPrompted in no small part by\nhis recent voluntary decision\nto close down his\nTwitter account.\nSo we talked about his\nrationale for doing that,\nhow he feels about doing that.\nAnd I think you'll find that\nto be very interesting as well.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my\ndesire and effort to bring\nzero-cost-to-consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\nLevels is a program that lets\nyou see how different foods\nand behaviors affect\nyour health by giving you\nreal-time feedback using a\ncontinuous glucose monitor.\nOne of the most\nimportant factors\nin your immediate\nand long-term health\nare your blood sugar levels.\nAnd not just your overall blood\nsugar levels but your blood\nsugar levels throughout the day\nin response to different foods\nyou eat, to fasting if you're\ninto fasting, to exercise,\nand so forth.\nI started using Levels\nsome time ago in order\nto figure out how different\nfoods impact my blood sugar\nlevels, and indeed, it\ndoes that very well.\nIt allowed me to see\nhow certain foods really\nspike my blood sugar and\nothers keep it more level.\nAnd in particular, how foods\nthat I eat after exercise\ncan help raise my blood\nglucose just enough but not so\nmuch that then I get a crash\ntwo or three hours later,\nwhich was what was happening\nbefore I started using Levels.\nI've made certain\nadjustments to my diet.\nI can now eat post-exercise\nand still have plenty of energy\nthroughout the day\nwithout any issues.\nIt also has helped me understand\nhow different behaviors impact\nmy blood glucose levels.\nIf you're interested in learning\nmore about Levels and trying\na continuous glucose\nmonitor yourself,\ngo to levels.link/huberman.\nAgain that's levels.link\nspelled L-I-N-K /huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by WHOOP.\nWHOOP is a fitness\nwearable device\nthat tracks your daily\nactivity and sleep\nbut goes beyond activity\nand sleep tracking\nto provide real-time feedback\non how to adjust your training\nand sleep schedules in order\nto feel and perform better.\nSix months ago, I started\nworking with WHOOP\nas a member of their\nscientific advisory council\nas a way to help WHOOP advance\ntheir mission of unlocking\nhuman performance.\nAnd as a WHOOP user,\nI've experienced\nfirsthand the health\nbenefits of their technology.\nIt's clear, based\non quality research,\nthat WHOOP can inform you\nhow well you're sleeping,\nhow to change your\nsleep habits, how\nto change your activity habits.\nEven how to modify different\naspects of your nutrition,\nexercise, sleep, and\nlifestyle in order\nto maximize your\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nSo whether or not\nyou're an athlete\nor you're exercising\nsimply for health,\nWHOOP can really\nhelp you understand\nhow your body functions\nunder different conditions\nand how to really program\nyour schedule, nutrition\nand exercise, and many\nother factors of your life\nin order to really optimize\nyour health and performance,\nincluding your cognition.\nIf you're interested\nin trying WHOOP,\nyou can go

mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep-tracking capacity.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout the fact that sleep\nis the fundamental layer\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nNow one of the key things for\ngetting a great night's sleep\nevery single night is to\noptimize the temperature\nof your sleeping environment.\nPut simply, in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep,\nyour body temperature needs to\ndrop by about 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd waking up, on\nthe other hand,\ninvolves a heating of your\nbody by about 1 to 3 degrees.\nWith Eight sleep, you\ncan tune the temperature\nof your mattress\ncover or mattress\nto be cooler or hotter depending\non whether or not you tend\nto run too hot or too cold.\nAnd you can even vary\nit across the night\nso that you can access the best\ndeep sleep early in the night.\nThe so-called REM sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep,\nthat's more pronounced in\nthe later half of the night.\nAnd doing so really\nget your sleep\noptimized not just\nin terms of duration\nbut in terms of quality and\nthe overall architecture\nof your sleep.\nThis has a profound influence\non your alertness, focus, mood,\nand many other important\nfactors throughout the day.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to save\nup to $150 off their\npod three

announce\nthat we are now partnered\nwith Momentous supplements.\nBecause Momentous\nsupplements are\nof the very highest quality.\nThey ship internationally,\nand they have\nsingle-ingredient formulations.\nIf you'd like to access\nthe supplements discussed\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nyou can go to live momentous\nspelled O-U-S so\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now, for my discussion\nwith Dr. Sam Harris.\nDr. Sam Harris.\nSAM HARRIS: [LAUGHTER]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We're\njust talking about this.\nSAM HARRIS: Yes, doctor.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nare indeed a doctor.\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\nSAM HARRIS: I cannot save\nyour life, but I am--\nI might save your non-existent\nsoul if we talk long enough.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHTER]\nWell, neither of us\nare clinicians, but\nwe are both brain\nexplorers from the\ndifferent perspectives.\nSome overlapping.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm\nreally excited to have\nthis conversation.\nI've been listening to\nyour voice for many years\nlearning from you\nfor many years.\nAnd I'd be remiss\nif I didn't say\nthat my father, who's\nalso a scientist,\nis an enormous fan of\nyour Waking Up app.\nSAM HARRIS: Nice.\nThat's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nhas spent a lot of time\nover the last few years.\nHe's in his late 70s.\nHe's almost 80.\nHe's a theoretical\nphysicist walking\nto the park near his\napartment and spending\ntime meditating with the app.\nOr sometimes\nseparate from the app\nbut using the same sorts\nof meditations in his head.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So he kind\nof toggles back and forth.\nAnd even-- I\nshouldn't say-- even\nbut-- yes, even in\nhis late 70s, has\nreported that it\nhas significantly\nshifted his awareness of self\nand his conscious experience\nof things happening\nin and around him.\nAnd he was somebody\nwho, I think,\nalready saw himself as\na pretty aware person.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thinking about\nquantum mechanics and the rest.\nSo a thank you from\nhim indirectly.\nSAM HARRIS: Oh, that's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A thank\nyou from me now directly.\nAnd I really want to use that as\na way to frame up what I think\nis one of the more interesting\nquestions in not just science\nand philosophy and\npsychology but all of life,\nwhich is what is this\nthing that we call a self?\nAs far as I know, we have\nnot localized the region\nin the brain that\ncan entirely account\nfor our perception of self.\nThere are areas, of course,\nthat regulate proprioception,\nour awareness of where\nour limbs are in space.\nMaybe even our awareness of\nwhere we are in physical space.\nThere are such circuits,\nas we both know.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But when\nwe talk about sense of self,\nI have to remember this kind\nof neuroscience 101 thing\nthat we always say.\nWhen you teach memory, you\nsay you wake up every morning,\nand you remember who you are.\nYou know who you are.\nMost people do.\nEven if they lack memory systems\nin the brain for whatever\nreason, pretty much everyone\nseems to know who they are.\nWhat are your thoughts on what\nthat whole thing is about?\nAnd do we come into the\nworld feeling that way?\nI would appreciate answers from\nthe perspective of any field--\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --including\nneuroscience, of course.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nWell, big question.\nI mean, the problem is we\nuse the term self in so\nmany different ways, right.\nAnd there's one sense\nof that term, which\nis the target of\nmeditation, and it's\nthe target of deconstruction\nby the practice and by,\nas you said, any\nsurrounding philosophy.\nSo you'll hear, and\nyou'll hear it from me,\nthat this self is\nan illusion, right.\nAnd that there's a\npsychological freedom that\ncan be experienced on the\nother side of discovering\nit to be an illusion.\nAnd some people don't\nlike that framing.\nSome people would insist that\nit's not so much an illusion,\nbut it's a construct, and\nit's not what it seems, right.\nBut it's not that every use of\nthe term self is illegitimate.\nAnd there are certain types of\nselves that are not illusory.\nI mean, I'm not saying\nthat people are illusions.\nI'm not saying that you\ncan't talk about yourself\nas distinct-- yourself\nas the whole person\nand with as\npsychological continuity\nwith your past experience\nas being distinct\nfrom the person and\npsychological continuity\nof some other person, right.\nI mean-- because\nobviously, we have\nto be able to\nconserve those data.\nIt's not fundamentally\nmysterious\nthat you're going\nto wake up tomorrow\nmorning still being\npsychologically continuous\nwith your past and\nnot my past, right.\nAnd if we swapped lives, that\nwould demand some explanation.\nSo the illusorines\nof the self doesn't\ncut against any of\nthose obvious facts.\nSo the sense of self\nthat is illusory.\nAnd again, we might want to\ntalk about self in other modes\nbecause there's just\na lot of interest\nthere psychologically and\nultimately scientifically.\nThe thing that doesn't exist--\nit certainly doesn't\nexist as it seems\nand I would want to argue\nthat it actually is just\na proper illusion,\nis this the sense\nthat there is a subject\ninterior to experience\nin addition to experience.\nSo most people feel\nlike they're having\nan experience of the world.\nAnd they're having their--\nan experience of their bodies\nin the world.\nAnd in addition\nto that, they feel\nthat they are a subject internal\nto the body, very likely\nin the head.\nMost people feel like they're\nbehind their face as a kind\nof locus of awareness and\nthought and intention and that\nevery-- it's almost like\nthey're-- you're a passenger\ninside your body.\nYou don't-- most people don't\nfeel identical to their bodies.\nAnd they can\nimagine this is sort\nof the origin, the\npsychological origin,\nthe folk psychological origin,\nof a sense of that there\nmight be a soul that could\nsurvive the death of the body.\nI mean, most people are\nwhat my friend Paul Blum\ncalls common sense do lists.\nYou-- you're just the\ndefault expectation\nseems to be that whatever the\nrelationship between the mind\nand the body, there\nis this-- there's\nsome promise of\nseparability there, right.\nThat the-- and whenever you\nreally push hard on the science\nside and say, well, no,\nno, the mind is really\njust what the brain\nis doing, that\nbegins to feel more and more\ncounterintuitive to people,\nand there still seems\nsome residual mystery\nthat at death maybe something\nis going to lift off the brain\nand go elsewhere, right.\nSo there's this sense of\ndualism that many people have.\nAnd obviously, that's supported\nby many religious beliefs.\nBut this feeling it is a\nvery peculiar starting point.\nPeople feel that in a--\nthey don't feel identical\nto their experience.\nAs a matter of experience,\nthey feel like they're\non the edge of experience.\nSomehow appropriating\nit from the side.\nYou kind of on the\nedge of the world.\nAnd the world is out there.\nYour body is, in\nsome sense, an object\nin the world which is\ndifferent from the world.\nThe boundary of your\nskin is still meaningful.\nYou can sort of loosely\ncontrol your body.\nI mean, you can't control it--\nyou can control your gross\nand subtle voluntary\nmotor movements,\nbut you can't-- you're\nnot controlling everything\nyour body is doing.\nYou're not controlling\nyour heartbeat\nand your hormonal\nsecretions and all of that.\nAnd so there's a\nlot that's going\non that is in the dark for you.\nAnd then you give someone an\ninstruction to meditate, say.\nAnd you say, OK, well,\nlet's examine all of this\nfrom the first person side.\nLet's look for this\nthing you're calling I.\nAnd again, I is not\nidentical to the body.\nPeople feel like their\nhands are out there.\nAnd when-- if they're\ngoing to meditate,\nthey're going to close\ntheir eyes very likely.\nAnd now they're going to\npay attention to something.\nThey're going to pay attention\nto the breath or the sounds.\nAnd it's from the point of view\nof being a locus of attention\nthat is now aiming attention\nstrategically at an object,\nlike the breath, that there's\nthis dualism that is set up.\nAnd ultimately, the ultimate\npromise of meditation.\nI mean, there are\nreally two levels\nat which you could be\ninterested in meditation.\nOne is very straightforward and\nremedial and non paradoxical\nand very well subscribed.\nAnd it's the usual set of claims\nabout all the benefits you're\ngoing to get from meditation.\nSo you're going to\nlower your stress,\nand you're going to\nincrease your focus,\nand you're going to stave\noff cortical thinning,\nand there's all\nkinds of good things\nthat science is saying\nmeditation will give you.\nAnd none of that entails\nreally drilling down\non this paradoxical claim\nthat the self is an illusion\nor anything else of that sort.\nBut from my point of\nview, the real purpose\nof meditation and\nits real promise\nis not in this long\nlist of benefits.\nAnd I'm not discounting\nany of those\nthough the science for many\nof them is quite provisional.\nIt's in this deeper claim that\nif you look for this thing\nyou're calling I. If\nyou look for the sense\nthat there's a thinker\nin addition to the mirror\nrising of the next thought,\nsay, you won't find that thing.\nAnd you can-- what's more,\nyou cannot find it in a way\nthat's conclusive and\nthat matters, right.\nAnd it has-- there's\na host of benefits\nthat follow from that\ndiscovery which are quite\na bit deeper and more\ninteresting than engaging\nmeditation on the\nside of its benefits.\nYou know, de-stressing,\nincreasing focus,\nand all the rest.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a\nnumber of questions related--\nSAM HARRIS: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --to\nwhat you just said.\nAnd first of all, I agree that\nthe evidence that meditation\ncan improve focus,\nreduce stress, et cetera.\nIt's there.\nIt's not an enormous pile of\nevidence, but it's growing.\nAnd--\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --I\nthink that especially\nfor some of the shorter\nmeditations, which\nI these days view more\nas perceptual exercises.\nI've talked about this\nin the podcast before.\nBut for those who haven't heard\nit before about perception.\nYou can have extra perception\nextending to things\nbeyond the confines\nof your skin.\nInterception, which\nis, I think, also\nincludes the surface of the\nskin but everything inward.\nAnd meditation through eyes\nclosed typically involving\nsome sort of attentional\nspotlighting, something\nwe'll get into more.\nInterior receptive versus\nexternal receptive events,\net cetera, including thoughts.\nAnd-- so I think of--\nat a basic level\nmeditation as somewhat\nof a perceptual exercise.\nYou can tell me where\nyou disagree there,\nand I would expect and\nhope that you would.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I would\nlike to just touch on this idea\nthat you brought up because\nit's such an interesting one.\nOf this idea that our bodies\nare containers and that\nwe somehow view\nourselves as passengers\nwithin those containers.\nThat's certainly\nbeen my experience.\nAnd the image that\nI have is of--\nas you say, that is\nof myself or of people\nout there that sit a few\ncentimeters below the surface\nor that sit entirely\nin their head.\nAnd, of course,\nthe brain and body\nare connected through\nthe nervous system.\nI think sometimes\na brain is used\nto replace a nervous\nsystem, and that\ncan get us into trouble\nin terms of coming up\nwith real directions\nand definitions.\nBut the point is that\nthere is something special\nabout the real\nestate in the head.\nI think for as much\nas my laboratory,\nand many other scientists\nare really interested\nin brain-body connections\nthrough the nervous system\nand other organ systems that\nthe nervous system binds\nthat if you cut\noff all my limbs,\nI'm going to be different, but\nI'm fundamentally still Andrew.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhereas if we were\nto lesion a couple of\nsquare millimeters out\nof my parietal cortex,\nit's an open question\nas to whether or not I would\nstill seem as much like Andrew\nto other people and to myself--\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --even.\nAnd so there is something\nfundamentally different\nabout the real estate\nin the cranial vault.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nI mean, we are--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You can\neven remove both of my eyes,\nI'd still be Andrew.\nAnd those are two pieces of\nmy central nervous system\nthat are fundamental to my\ndaily life, but I'd still be me.\nWhereas-- and this\ndoesn't, I think,\njust apply to memory systems.\nI mean, I think\nthere are regions\nof the frontal cortex\nthat, when destroyed,\nhave been shown to modify\npersonality and self-perception\nin dramatic ways.\nSo it's a sort of obvious\npoint once it's made,\nbut I do think it's worth\nhighlighting because there\ndoes seem to be something\nspecial about being\nin the head.\nThe other thing is that\nsitting a few centimeters\nbelow the surface or\nriding in this container\nmakes sense to me.\nExcept I wonder if\nyou've ever experienced\na shift as I have when\nsomething very extreme happens.\nLet's use the negative\nexample of all of a sudden\nyou're in a fear state.\nAll of a sudden, it feels as\nif your entire body is you\nor is me.\nAnd now I need to get this\nthing-- the whole container\nand me to some place of\nsafety in whatever form.\nThis is also true, I\nthink, in ecstatic states--\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --where\nyou can feel really--\nwhen people say embodied,\nI wonder whether or not\nwe normally oscillate below\nthe surface of our body.\nWhen I say oscillate,\nI mean in neural terms.\nI mean, maybe our\nsensory experience\nis not truly at\nthe bodily surface\nbut sits below the\nbodily surface more\nat the level of organ\nsystems and within our head.\nAnd then certain\nthings that jolt us--\nour autonomic nervous system\ninto heightened states\nbring us into states of--\nbring us closer to the\nsurface and therefore include\nall of us.\nAgain, I don't want to take us\ndown a mechanistic description\nof something that doesn't exist.\nBut does any of that\nresonate in terms\nof how you are thinking\nabout or describing the self?\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah.\nThere's a lot there.\nFirst, on the point of\nthe brain being the locus\nof what we are as minds.\nYeah, I mean, there\nare people who\nwill insist that sort of\nthe whole nervous system\nhas to be thought of as a--\nwhen you're talking\nabout our emotional life\nand the insulas\nconnection to the gut.\nAnd just the sense of self\nextends beyond the brain.\nBut I totally take your\npoint that a brain transplant\nis a coherent\nidea, and you would\nexpect to go with the brain\nrather than with the viscera.\nAnd so, in that\nsense, we really are\nthe old philosophical\nthought experiment\nof being a brain in a VAT.\nI mean, we essentially\nare already--\nthe VAT is our skull, and we're\nvirtually in that situation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nA horrible movie.\nI'm sorry I can't\nhelp but interrupt.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When\nI was a teenager,\nmy sister and I used\nto go to the movies\nevery once in a while,\nand we'd trade off\nwho could pick the movie.\nAnd she took me to see once\nthe movie Boxing Helena.\nSAM HARRIS: Oh yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nDavid Lynch film--\nSAM HARRIS: Which I\nnever saw that again.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--where he amputates\nthe limbs of a woman who he's\nobsessed by and keeps her.\nIt's a really horrible--\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --film.\nAnd about 20 minutes into it,\nmy sister just turned to me\nand said, I'm so sorry.\nAnd the question there\nwas whether or not\ntwo siblings should actually\npersist in a movie like that.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And we\ndecided to persist in the movie\nso that we could\nlaugh about it later.\nBut it was rather disturbing.\nI don't recommend the movie.\nNor do I recommend\nseeing it with a sibling.\nBut in that movie, the woman,\nhe takes her as a container\nand restricts her movement.\nQuite sadistic and\nhorrible thing really.\nDavid Lynch, interesting\nmind perhaps.\nBut the idea was to question\nhow much of the person\npersists in the absence of their\nability to move, et cetera.\nCould there be love?\nCould there be these\nother affections?\nAnyway, a rather\nextreme example.\nBut one that still haunts me.\nAnd I suppose I'm\nthinking about still now.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSAM HARRIS: Well, so just\nto follow that point,\nthere's a lot about us that we\ndon't have access to unless we\nenact it physically.\nLike if I ask you, do you\nstill know how to ride a bike?\nThere's no place in\nyour memory where\nyou can inspect but just\nsitting in your chair\nthat you've retained\nthe knowledge of how\nto ride a bike.\nProcedural memory\nis different from\nsemantic or episodic memory.\nIf I asked you, do\nyou know your address?\nYes, you can recall your\naddress just sitting there.\nBut if you had had a micro\nstroke that neatly dissected\nout your ability to\nride a bike and left\neverything else\nintact, you might\nthink you could ride a bike.\nBut suddenly, you\nstand up next to one.\nAnd you have no idea\nwhat to do with it.\nAnd that would be\na discovery that\nwould only happen if\nyou were motorically\nengaged with that object.\nAnd I'm sure we could\nprobably come up\nwith 100 things about us\nthat really seem core to us\nand not separable from\nour personhood which\nseemed to only get\ninvoked when we're\nout they're moving in the world,\nand we have limbs, et cetera.\nNo, it's the seat\nof consciousness,\nthe right framework\nto talk about all\nof this, from my\npoint of view, is\nconsciousness and its contents.\nSo we have consciousness.\nThe fact that there's something\nthat is like to be us,\nthe fact that the world\nand our internal experience\nis illuminated.\nIt has a qualitative character.\nAnd then, there's\nthe question of what\nis that qualitative character?\nWhat kinds of information\ndo we have access to?\nWhat does it feel like to be us?\nHow do different states\nof arousal change that?\nSo you talked about fear.\nYeah, fear can change\na lot of things.\nAnd various neurological\ndeficits, or you\ncan add drugs to the mix.\nYou add psychedelics\nthat radically transform\nthe contents of consciousness.\nFrom my point of\nview, consciousness\nitself is simply the\ncognizance, the awareness,\nthat is the flood lights\nby which any of that stuff\nappears.\nSo consciousness doesn't change.\nBut its contents change.\nAnd to come back to meditation\nfor a second, many people\nthink meditation\nis about changing\nthe contents of consciousness.\nThere are some contents you\nwant to get rid of like anxiety.\nOther contents you\nwant to encourage,\nlike calm, and unconditional\nlove, or some other classically\npleasant, prosocial emotion.\nAnd that's all fine.\nThat's all possible.\nBut the real wisdom of\nthe 2000-year-old wisdom\nof meditation that really is the\nchewy center of the Tootsie Pop\nis a recognition of what\nconsciousness itself is always\nalready like regardless\nof the contents in it\nand the changes in contents.\nAnd this is why we\nmight talk about this.\nBut this is why they're\nmutually compatible.\nPsychedelics and meditation,\nfor me, are somewhat orthogonal.\nBecause psychedelics is all\nabout making wholesale changes\nto the contents\nof consciousness.\nAnd there's some wonderful\nconsequences of doing that.\nThere can be some harrowing\nand terrifying consequences\nof doing that.\nBut generally speaking,\nI think used wisely,\nthey can be incredibly valuable.\nAnd the therapeutic\npotential there is enormous.\nBut the crucial disjunction\nhere is that there really\nis something to recognize about\nordinary waking consciousness,\nthe consciousness that's\ncompatible with my driving\na car to get here on time.\nYou don't have to have the\npyrotechnics of being on LSD\nto see to transcend the\ncentral illusion that I'm\nsaying is the thing\nto be transcended,\nwhich is the sense that there\nis a duality between subject\nand object in every\nmoment of experience.\nAnd to take it back to something\nyou said about just all\nof our different modes\nin ordinary life,\nthe interesting thing is I\nthink people are constantly\nlosing their sense of self.\nAnd they're not aware of it.\nAnd there's probably an\nanalogy to the visual system\nhere, which is to visual\nsaccade, which perhaps you've\nspoken about at some\npoint on your podcast.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not enough.\nSo please.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nSo what happens every\ntime we move our eyes,\nthis is called a saccade.\nAnd we do that about three times\na second or so just normally.\nThere is the region\nof motor cortex\nthat affects that\nmovement sends what's\ncalled an efferent copy of\nthat motor movement, which\nis used as information\nthat propagates back\nto visual cortex, that\nsuppresses the data of vision\nwhile the eyes are moving.\nBecause otherwise if\nyou weren't doing that,\nevery time you\nmoved your eyes, it\nwould seem like the visual scene\nitself was lurching around.\nAnd people can experience\nthis for themselves\nif they just touch one of\ntheir eyeballs on the side,\nnot all that hard,\nand kind of jiggle it.\nAnd then, you can\nroll it around.\nYou can jiggle it\nfrom side to side.\nYou can see a movement\nof the eyeball that's\nnot governed by your\noculomotor system\ndelivers a jiggling\nof the world.\nBecause your brain is\nnot anticipating it\nin the same way.\nAnd you're not producing\nthat same predictive copy\nof the movement.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\na little bit like--\nwe have some action sports\nfilmmakers on our staff\nhere that the gimbal,\nthat holds an iPhone,\nlike you see the\nkids on surfboards\nor skateboards or something.\nThey're going to hold a\nphone while moving around\nor the people, the\nvloggers-- does anyone\neven still use that for phrase?\nSAM HARRIS: I don't know.\nI guess.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Moving around\nand it's image stabilization,\nessentially, that keeps\nthe camera steady.\nAnd these are more than\ncameras, of course,\nfor those listening,\npoint at my eyes.\nBut they do far more than\njust what a camera would do.\nBut this internal system\nof image stabilization, I\ncan see perhaps where\nyou're going with this,\nthat it allows us to remain in\na self-referencing scheme, as\nopposed to paying attention\nto just how confusing it\nis to track the visual\nworld at some level.\nSAM HARRIS: Well, actually\nwhere I'm going is,\nthat people are having this\nsuppression of vision three\ntimes a second on average.\nAnd they're not experiencing it.\nYou're effectively going blind.\nAnd you're not noticing it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very fast.\nSAM HARRIS: Yes, it's very fast.\nNow there's an analogous\nsuppression, I would say,\nof the sense of self that\noccurs every time attention gets\nabsorbed significantly\nin its object.\nWe even have this concept of\nlosing yourself in your work.\nClassic flow experiences\nhave this quality.\nAnd this tends to be why\nthey're so rewarding.\nIf you're in some athletic\nactivity or an aesthetic one,\nor you could be having\nsex, or whatever\nit is, some peak experience,\nits peakness usually\nentails there being\nsome brief period\nwhere there was no distance\nbetween you and the experience.\nFor that moment,\nyou were no longer\nlooking over your own shoulder\nor anticipating the next moment\nor trying to get somewhere,\nwhere you weren't,\nor micromanaging errors.\nThere's just the flow of unity\nwith whatever the experience\nis, a surfer on the wave.\nAnd we love those experiences.\nAnd then we are continually\nabstracted away from them\nby our thinking about them.\nWe're thinking, oh my\ngod, that was so good,\nor how do I get back to that?\nOr you're looking at a sunset.\nIt's the most beautiful\nsunset you've ever seen.\nAnd then you're continually\ninterrupting the experience\nof merely seeing it with\na commentary about how\namazing this is.\nAnd I wonder, what real\nestate prices are here?\nI mean, is it possible\nthat I could move here.\nAnd your mind is just\ncontinually narrating\na conversation you're having\nwith yourself, however\nparadoxically.\nI mean, you're telling\nyourself things\nthat you already know as\nthough there are two of you\nrather often.\nI'm looking for--\nwhich is the water.\nAnd it's, oh, there it is.\nBut I'm the one seeing it.\nWho am I saying,\noh, there it is to.\nIs there someone else\nwho needs to be informed\nabout the thing I already saw.\nSo there's something about\nour internal dialogue\nthat is paradoxical.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there\nany neurologic condition\ncall it soulectomy or anything\nlike that where somehow people\nfeel more unified with the\nself on a continual basis,\nthe observer and\nthe actor within?\nState more as a\ncomplete sentence.\nIs there any known\nneurological syndrome--\nmakes it sound like a bad thing,\nbut it could be a good thing.\n--whereby people\nfeel that the actor\nand the observer within them\nare unified continually?\nSAM HARRIS: There's\nnot a pathological one.\nSome the work on the\ndefault-mode network\nsuggests that that's at\nleast part of the story.\nSo the default-mode\nnetwork, which\nhas been talked about a\nlot of late because it\nhas come up both in the\nmeditation literature\nand in the psychedelic\nliterature.\nBut its original discovery\nwas that-- and the reason\nwhy I was called the\ndefault mode was is\nthat in virtually every\nneuroimaging experiment ever\nrun, they found that between\ntasks, when the brain was just\nin its default state, these\nmidline structures would\nincrease their activity.\nAnd then they would\nreliably diminish\nwhenever the person in\nthe scanner was on task.\nAnd usually, that meant\nsome outward looking\nvisual discrimination task.\nBut it could be visual.\nIt could be semantic.\nBut it tends to be\ntheir eyes are open.\nAnd they're paying\nattention to something\nthat's being broadcast to\nthem through monitor goggles,\nor they're looking at a mirror\nthat's showing them a computer\nmonitor.\nBut so the general\ninsight was, there\nare these midline\nstructures in the brain that\nseem to be increasing\ntheir activity when\nthe brain is idling\nbetween tasks, waiting\nfor something to happen.\nAnd then further\nexperiments found\ntasks that actually upregulated\nactivity there beyond baseline.\nAnd those tasks seem\nto be self referential.\nSo that when you ask people--\nyou give them a list of words.\nAnd you say, well, do any\nof these apply to you?\nOr you ask people\nto think about--\nActually, one experiment I did.\nWhen you're challenging\npeople's beliefs, when you're\nchallenging beliefs\nthat have more\nof a personal significance, like\npolitical or religious beliefs,\nyou get an upregulation\nin these regions\nas opposed to just generic\nbeliefs about you're\nin Los Angeles.\nThis is a table.\nThat is something to which\npeople are not holding fast\nas a matter of identity.\nSo anyway, both meditation\nand psychedelics\nseem to suppress activity\nin these regions, which\nwe know are associated with\nboth self-talk, mind-wandering,\nand explicit acts of\nself representation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nCould we say that they\nare somewhat\nautobiographical because they\naccess memory systems?\nAnd in the way you're\ndescribing them,\nand in the way that\na colleague of mine,\nwho's been a guest\non this podcast--\nI don't know if you've\ninteracted with him before.\nBut I think you'd very much\nenjoy whatever interaction you\nwould have. --is David Spiegel.\nHe's our associate\nchair of psychiatry.\nHe and his father\nactually-- his father\nthen he founded hypnosis as\na valid clinical practice\nin psychiatry.\nAnd hypnosis, which is obviously\na heightened sense of attention\nwith deep relaxation, is\nknown to dramatically suppress\nthe default-mode network.\nHe talks about this a lot.\nAnd I always wonder as\nwe take down activity\nwithin the default-mode\nnetwork, what what surfaces\nin its place, does that\nsomehow reflect that the two\nare normally in a push-pull?\nBecause that's not\nnecessarily the case.\nWhen I fall asleep,\nI can hallucinate.\nBut that doesn't mean\nthat during the day,\nthe fact that I'm\nlooking at objects\nis what's preventing\nme from hallucinating.\nIf I close my eyes,\nI can get imagery.\nBut there's this\ndifferent illusion,\nthe illusion of antagonistic\ncircuitry sometimes.\nI don't want to\ntake us off course,\nbut the default-mode network\nseems to \"want to be there,\"\nquote, unquote.\nIt seems to be fighting\nfor our attention,\nunless we give ourselves\na visual target,\nor an auditory target, or\nsome salient experience\nof some kind, it sounds like.\nAnd then, I'm surprised to\nhear that meditation reduces\nactivity in the default-mode\nnetwork at some level\nbecause meditation\nto me oftentimes\ninvolves paying attention\nto some perceptual target.\nMaybe you could\neventually explain\nas to how it might do\nthat or why it might.\nSAM HARRIS: And I don't\nthink it's the whole story\nbecause, obviously,\noutward-going attention is\nnot--\neven if you're having\nthe kind of egoic\nsaccade that I'm talking about,\nwhere you're actually not\nclearly aware of yourself.\nYou're not clearly\ndefining yourself\nas separate from experience for\nthe moment of paying attention,\nso you are sort of losing\nyourself in your work.\nThat's not the same\nthing as having\nthe clear meditative insight of\nselflessness that I'm claiming\nis the goal of meditation.\nBut to wind back to the\noriginal point I was making,\nand the reason why I drew the\nanalogy to visual saccades,\nI do think there's a continuous\ninterruption in our sense\nof self that goes unrecognized.\nBut the conscious acquisition\nof the understanding\nthat the self is an illusion\nis a different experience\nbecause you're then\nfocusing on this absence.\nActually, there's\nanother analogy\nto the visual system\nthat applies here,\nwhich is to the optic\nblind spot, which\nis a good analogy for\nme because it cuts\nthrough a bunch of\nfalse assumptions\nas to where you\nwould look for this\nor how this relates to\nordinary experience.\nSo as many people know\nthat in both eyes we have\nwhat's called the\nblind spot, which\nis a consequence of the\noptic nerve transiting\nthrough the retina,\nunlike cephalopods.\nI think cephalopods\nhave their optic nerve,\nas an omniscient being\nwould have engineered it,\nconnecting the\nretina from the back.\nAnd therefore, there\nis no area of blindness\nassociated with its transit\nback through the retina.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But our\nreceptors are one the outside.\nSAM HARRIS: Exactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHumans, for whatever\nreason, put photoreceptors--\nwell, I always\nsay I wasn't consulted\non the design phase.\nSomething put photoreceptors,\ncombination of things,\nput photoreceptors in the back.\nAnd so you actually have to\nsend the highway of information\nthrough the pixel\ncenter of the eye.\nCephalopods and\ndrosophila, basically\ninvertebrates, the design\nis more at its face logical.\nMammals, very illogical\ndesign, at least as far\nas our judgments go.\nSAM HARRIS: But it\ngives me a good analogy.\nSo I'll take it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand acknowledge our\nsponsor, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin-mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains digestive\nenzymes and adaptogens.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nSo that's 10 years\nnow of taking Athletic\nGreens every single day.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring this podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens,\nis that it covers all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nSo whether or not\nI'm eating well\nor enough or not, I'm sure that\nI'm covering all of my needs\nfor vitamins,\nminerals, probiotics,\nadaptogens to combat stress.\nAnd the digestive enzymes\nreally help my digestion.\nI just feel much better when\nI'm drinking Athletic Greens.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd for the month\nof January, they\nhave a special\noffer where they'll\ngive you 10 free travel\npacks, plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nVitamin D3 and K2 are\nvital for immune function,\nmetabolic function,\nhormone health,\nbut also calcium regulation\nand heart health.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim their special offer in\nthe month of January of 10 free\ntravel packs, plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 and K2.\nSAM HARRIS: So in\nany case, we have\nthis blind spot, which I\nthink most people learn\nthis in school.\nAlthough, my daughters had not\nbeen taught this in school.\nI just showed them this for\nthe first time a month ago.\nAnd they were\nbriefly fascinated.\nAnd then they went to\nreturn to their screen time.\nBut anyway, you can\ntake a piece of paper.\nAnd you make two marks on it.\nAnd then you cover one eye.\nAnd you fixate on one mark.\nI mean, you can\nlook this up online\nif you need details\nabout how to do this.\nAnd while staring at\none fixation point,\nyou move the paper\nback and forth.\nAnd you can get it\nto a place where\nthe other mark disappears.\nAnd you can run this\nexperiment long enough\nto satisfy yourself\nthat there is\nin fact a blind spot in\nyour visual field, which\nwith one eye closed you\ndon't normally notice.\nThe reason why you\nhave to cover one eye\nis because each eye\ncompensates for the blind spot\nof the other.\nWhich is to say that\nif you close one eye\nand survey the visual scene,\nsomething really is missing,\nwhatever you're looking at.\nIf you're looking at\na crowd of people,\nsomebody is missing a head\nand you're not noticing it.\nAnd it's not easy to notice\nbecause the brain doesn't\ntend to vividly represent\nthe absence of information.\nI mean, it's just part of the\ngame that's not being rendered.\nIt's not showing up as a\nbreak in the visual field.\nIt's just not there.\nAnd I mean, people have\nargued that there's\na filling-in phenomenon\nthat happens,\nbut I think that can be\nmisunderstood or exaggerated.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But the\neye movements themselves,\nthat you described before--\nI guess, I should say\nthat the saccade analogy\nabout transiently and\nrepetitively erasing the self\nworks perfectly here because,\nindeed, microsaccades,\nlittle smaller saccades, occur\nall the time also prevent\nour eyes from fixating\nin one location\nlong enough to observe\nour blind spot,\neven if one eye is closed.\nSo if the experiment's done with\nparalytics to essentially lock\neyes at one location, basically,\nthings start disappearing.\nSAM HARRIS: It just fades away.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We\nall love to think\nthat we start hallucinating, but\nactually, we start going blind.\nAnd those experiments\nhave been done on humans.\nI hear they're quite terrifying.\nSAM HARRIS: I mean, you can\ndo that for yourself too.\nIt begins to just all\nmelt away in a warm glow.\nNo psychedelics required.\nBut the interesting\npoint there is\nthat when you ask\nyourself, OK, so\nbecause as a consequence\nof the eyes' anatomy,\nthere's this thing\nyou can see that is\nabsent from your experience.\nBut the question\nis, where is that\nin relationship to the\nrest of you, to your mind?\nIs that deep within?\nOr is that in some sense right\non the surface of experience?\nAnd there's expectation\nthat people have.\nAgain, I think\nconflating meditation\nwith a search for changes in\nthe context of consciousness.\nThey're looking for\nmuch more subtle things\nto notice about the mind or\nmuch vaster things to notice.\nPsychedelics sets\nup this expectation\nthat you do a massive\ndose of mushrooms or LSD,\nand everything changes.\nI mean, you get this\nfull beatific vision.\nAnd you get not only visual\nchanges, but emotional changes.\nAnd you get synesthesia,\nwhere you have\nmuch more mind in so many ways.\nSo they begin having\nthese experiences,\nor reading the mystical\nliterature, you begin to think,\nOK, well, then freedom is really\nelsewhere or it's deep within.\nIt's not coincident with\nthe ordinary awareness\nthat can see this\ncoffee cup clearly\nand that can just\ntransition attention\nto reading an email\nwith the full sobriety\nof ordinary waking\nconsciousness.\nBut the truth is, this\ninsight into selflessness,\nthis insight into the nonduality\nof subject and object,\nis as close to ordinary\nconsciousness as this insight\ninto the optic blind spot.\nWhere do you have to\ngo to have this insight\ninto the blind spot?\nyou don't have to go anywhere.\nYou just have to set up the\nexperiment correctly such\nthat you can see the data.\nBut the data is\nright on the surface.\nIt's almost too close\nto you to notice.\nIf it's at all hard\nto notice, it's\nbecause it's so close,\nrather than it's\ndeep within or far away.\nAnd there are other\nanalogies like--\nI don't even remember.\nThere's Mind's Eye,\npieces of artwork,\nthat were the random\ndot stereo grams, where\nwe have an image that pops out.\nI always find it very difficult\nto see those because I\nhave a very dominant eye.\nBut some people can see.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nPeople can't see those.\nThese images that used to\nbe at the touristy shops.\nBut people say, oh,\nthere it is, the whale.\nAnd I'm thinking,\nI don't see it.\nKids that swim a lot\nwhen they're younger,\nand they tend to breathe\njust to one side--\nI don't know if this was you.\nThis was definitely me.\nThey tend to keep\none eye closed.\nYou set up a pretty\nstrong ocular dominance.\nBiasing your vision to one or\nthe other eye early in life,\nwhether or not you're learning\nhow to be a bow hunter\nor you're learning how\nto throw darts or shoot\nbilliards or anything that,\ninvolves selectively viewing\nthe world through one eye\nfor even a couple of hours\ncan set up a permanent\nasymmetry in the weighting\nflow of visual information\nfrom the eye to the brain.\nIt's reversible, but only\nthrough the reverse gymnastics\nof covering up the\nother eye intentionally.\nSo actually I had to be\nreversed-patched for a while\nbecause I was seeing\ndouble, because I\nlost binocular vision.\nI don't stand a chance in hell\nof seeing an image pop out\nof a random dot\nstereogram, which\nis kind of ironic because I did\nmy PhD on binocular circuitry.\nBut nonetheless, if\npeople can see these,\nor if they can't, I\nthink they provide\na really terrific\nexample of what you're\ntalking about as a larger theme,\nwhich is that perceptually you\nsee a bunch of dots.\nAnd then all of a sudden,\nwhat you thought wasn't there\nis suddenly there, but\ncan just disappear again.\nThere are certain\nvisual illusions,\nif we were to include others,\nthat once you see them,\nyou cannot unsee them.\nSo there's the faces-vases,\nfigure-ground type stuff.\nSAM HARRIS: Bi-stable percepts.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBi-stable percepts.\nAnd then there's sort\nof ocular competition.\nYou show two different images to\nthe eyes, each of the two eyes.\nAnd it is near\nimpossible for people\nto perceive them\nboth simultaneously.\nSo it's a little bit of\nwhat you're describing.\nI mean, these seem to\nbe fundamental features\nabout the way the neural\ncircuits are organized,\nthat they don't want to stay\nfixated on any one thing\nfor very long.\nTo do so either takes training,\nintense interest, intense fear,\nintense excitement.\nWhen I say intense, I guess,\nI come back to this idea\nthat the autonomic\nnervous system is somehow\ngoverning our ability to\nspotlight at any one location\nfor very long.\nIs that a useful framework?\nOr is that going to take\nus down a different path?\nSAM HARRIS: Well, it's sort\nof a different path for this.\nI mean, the only\npoint I was making\nis that the\nseemingly paradoxical\nclaim that something can\nbe right on the surface\nand yet hard to see.\nAnd again, this seems to\njustify the expectation held\nby, I would think,\nthe vast majority\nof people who get interested\nin these spiritual things,\nfor lack of a better word,\nthat the truth must somehow\nbe deep within.\nThere's some distance between\nthe one who is looking\nand the thing that\nhas to be found right\nand that you have to go through\nthis long evolution of changes.\nI mean, there are many\nmetaphors that set this up.\nIt's like you're at\nthe base of a mountain,\nand you have to\nclimb to the top.\nAnd so you have\nto find the path,\nhowever secure it\nis to get you there.\nBut there really is a distance\nbetween your starting point\nand the goal.\nAnd what I'm arguing--\nand this is a kind of a nondual,\nto use a term of jargon--\nthis is a nondual\napproach to meditation,\nas opposed to a dualistic one.\nThe path and the\ngoal are coincident,\nthat you have to unravel the\nlogic by which you would seek\nsomething that's outside\nof the present moment's\nexperience, i.e. not available,\nreally not available to you\nnow.\nBecause so many things\nworth having, so many skills\nworth acquiring, really are\nnot available to you now.\nIt's like if you\nwant to be a pianist,\nor if you want to\nspeak Chinese, there's\nsomething you don't know.\nAnd then you want\nto learn that thing.\nAnd there's a whole process.\nAnd you might not be\ncapable of doing it.\nAnd real mastery is far away.\nIf you've never hit\na golf ball, and you\nwant to hit a golf ball\n300 yards straight,\nI can pretty much\nguarantee you're not\ngoing to do that initially.\nAnd you're not going\nto do it on day two.\nAnd you're not going to do it\nreliably for the longest time.\nAnd there's real\ntraining in front of you\nto be able to do that reliably.\nAn insight into, and\nreally the core insight,\nI mean, the insight that is the\ncore of the Buddha's teaching,\nto take one historical\nexample of this,\nreally is available now.\nI mean, granted, it can be\nvery hard, one, for people.\nI mean, I had\nprobably spent a year\non silent retreat in one week\nto three month increments\nbefore I got the\npoint I'm making now.\nI mean, literally,\nthese are retreats\nwhere you spend 12 to 18\nhours a day just meditating,\ntrying to unpack the kinds\nof claims I'm making now.\nSo it's possible to\nrigorously overlook this.\nIt's possible to stand in\nfront of the mind's eye image\nand stare in a way\nthat is guaranteed\nnot to give you\npop out and to be\nadept at staring in that way.\nSo it's possible to be misled.\nAnd so what I'm\ntrying to argue here\nis that there's a fair\namount of leverage\nyou can get with better\ninformation, which\ncan cut the time course of\nyour searching for this thing\nand cancel your false\nexpectations about just\nwhere this is in relation\nto your ordinary waking\nconsciousness.\nAnd it's possible to\nget bad information\nand to have a bunch\nof experiences.\nYou go you go and do\nan ayahuasca trip.\nAnd it's incredibly valuable.\nAnd it's valuable\nfor all the ways\nin which it changed the\ncontents of your consciousness\nin startling ways.\nAnd you had insights\ninto your past\nand into your relationships\nand into why you're\nnot as loving as you might be.\nAnd there's lots to think about.\nAnd you're like, OK,\nthat's all great.\nThat's all something\nthat we can talk about.\nBut it truly is orthogonal.\nI mean, it makes a\npoint of contact,\nor what I'm talking about,\nit's really just at one point.\nAnd it's at the point\nwhere this sense\nof subject-object\ndivision in consciousness\nis illusory and vulnerable\nto investigation.\nAnd if you investigate it as\nthe right plane of focus--\nyou pick the analogy you\nwant, whether it's setting up\nthe optic blind spot experiment\nin just the right way,\nso that you can see that\nthe data is not there.\nI mean, the bi-stable percept is\ngreat because when you see one\nof these images, like\nthe vase-face diagram,\nor the Dalmatian that it\nlooks like a mess of dots,\nand then you see the image\nof a Dalmatian dog pop out--\nonce you see it, you\nreally can't unsee it.\nI mean, once you have the\nrequisite conceptual anchor\nto it, then every time you look,\nyou're going to find it again.\nAnd eventually, it\nbecomes effortless.\nAnd that's what,\nultimately, meditation is,\nI mean, this kind of meditation.\nYou ultimately\nlearn to recognize\nthat there's no\nseparation between you\nand your experience.\nThere's not the\nexperience on the one hand\nand the self on the other.\nThere's just experience.\nThere's just seeing, hearing,\nsmelling, tasting, touching,\nthinking, feeling,\nproprioception,\nadd whatever channels of\ninformation you want to that.\nBut there's just the totality\nof the energy of consciousness\nand its contents.\nAnd it's not that\nyou're on the riverbank.\nAnd this is how it can\nseem in the beginning,\neven when you're practicing\nmeditation fairly diligently.\nYou can seem like\nyou're on the riverbank,\nwatching the contents of\nconsciousness flow by.\nAnd meditation is the act\nof doing that more and more\ndispassionately, so you're no\nlonger grabbing at the pleasant\nor pushing the unpleasant away.\nYou're just kind of relaxing in\nthe most non-judgmental frame\nof mind, just\nwitnessing the flow.\nBut if you're doing\nthat dualisticly,\nyou feel like the meditator.\nYou feel like the\nsubject aiming attention.\nAnd so now you're\non the riverbank\nwatching everything go past.\nBut the truth is,\nyou are the river.\nExperience itself is that there\nis just experience itself.\nYou're not on the\nedge of experience.\nAnd everything you can\nnotice is part of the flow.\nAnd there's no point from\nwhich to abstract yourself away\nfrom the flow to\nstand outside it\nand to say, OK, this is my life.\nThis is my experience.\nThis is my body.\nYes, you can do that.\nI mean, those are\nall just thoughts.\nBut that's more of the flow.\nAnd so there's a process by\nwhich you would eventually\nrecognize that there's\nno distance between you\nand your experience.\nAnd again, you can wait\nfor those moments in life\nwhere experience gets so\ngood, or so terrifying,\nit's just so salient.\nYour amygdala is\ndriving so hard.\nI mean, so you're\nin a war, and you\ncan't think about anything\nbecause the enemy is\nshooting at you.\nAnd this is the most\nthrilling video game\nyou've ever played in your life.\nAnd your life is on the line.\nOr you're at the peak\nof some athletic event,\nwhere you don't know how you're\ndoing the things you're doing,\nbut it's all happening\nautomatically.\nBut those are 1/100\nof 1% of one's life.\nAnd you know what I'm\ncalling meditation\nis a way of simply understanding\nthe mechanics of a tension\nwhereby you are denying yourself\nthat unity of experience\nso much of the time and\nrecognizing that it's\nbased on a misperception\nof the way consciousness\nalways already is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, if\nthere wasn't an incentive\nto learn how to meditate\nproperly, that was one.\nAnd I've been meditating\nfor a fair amount\nsince I was in my teens, but\nmore along the lines of paying\nattention to breath and\nopen-observer type meditation,\nor focused-attention.\nI would suppose more of\nthe focused-attention type.\nWe'll get into these\na little bit later.\nBut I have a number of questions\nrelated to what you just said.\nSAM HARRIS: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love the idea\nthat this thing that we would\nall do well to understand to\nobserve consciousness of self\nas opposed to trying to alter\nthe contents of consciousness\nmay sit much closer to\nus than one might think.\nAnd because it sits\nso close to us,\nthat might be one of the\nreasons why we miss it.\nI go right to a\nvisual system example.\nI mean, if you're\nwearing corrective lenses\nand there's a\nspeck on your lens,\ntypically you're looking\nout through the lens,\nand so you wouldn't\nobserve that speck.\nAny number of different\nanalogies could work here.\nThe fact that there\nare states, however\nfew, positive and negative,\nextreme ecstasy and extreme\nfear being the two, I\nthink, most obvious ones\nthat seems like\nwe agree on, that\nallow us to capture the\nsense of completeness of self\nor the unity of the\nobserver and the actor.\nThe fact that those are\nseldom for the nontrained,\nfor the nonmeditator,\nsuggests to me two things.\nI think one perhaps worth\nexploring more than the other.\nBut one is that what's really\nbeing revealed in the states\nwhere we can feel the\nunity of the observer\nand the actor is understanding\nsomething fundamental\nabout the algorithm, not\nthe online algorithm,\nbut the algorithm that\nis our nervous system.\nJust as you mentioned\ncephalopods.\nI mean, mantis shrimp see an\nenormous array of color hues\nthat we don't.\nTheir maps and\nrepresentations of the world\nare fundamentally different.\nPit vipers see in the infrared.\nWe're restricted to\nsomewhat of a limited range\nwithin the color\nspectrum, but still more\nvast than that of dogs or cats.\nSo understanding\nthat for seeing what\na pit viper can see for\nmoments would be informative.\nPerhaps sensing-heat emissions\nas a human might be invasive,\nmaybe that's why we don't do it.\nSo the question is, to just\nmake it straightforward,\nwhy would the system\nbe designed this way?\nAgain, neither of us were\nconsulted in the design phase.\nBut that brings me to, perhaps,\nthe more tractable question\nwas, which is about development.\nI'm a great believer that the\nneural circuits that encouraged\nhealthy parent-child relations,\nor unhealthy parent-child\nrelations as the case\nmay be, in childhood stem\nfrom the initial\ndemands of internal\nversus external states, which\nis exactly what we're talking\nabout, which is that a young\nchild feels anxious because it\nneeds his diaper change.\nIt doesn't really know it needs\nits diaper changed or it's cold\nor it's uncomfortable or it's\nhungry or it's overly full.\nAnd so it vocalizes.\nAnd then some external\nsource comes to us\nand relieves that hopefully.\nAnd so the fundamental\nrule that we first learn\nis not that we have a self or\nthat things fall down, not up.\nBut it's that when\nuncomfortable,\nexternalize that discomfort.\nAnd it will be relieved\nby an outside player.\nAnd then, of course, there's a\nrepurposing of that circuitry\nfor adult romantic attachments.\nI don't think\nanyone doubts that.\nAnd that can explain a lot\nindeed about attachment\nand so forth.\nSo something about our\ndevelopmental wiring\nand the algorithms that\nthese neural circuits run\ntend to bias most people,\nthe nonpractice meditators,\nto live a somewhat\nfunctional life at least\nwithout this awareness\nof actor and observer.\nAnd so what you're\nreally talking about\nis a deliberate intervention\nto understand and resolve\nthat gap in the algorithm.\nDo I have that right?\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'm more or less\nrestating what you said\nin a way that, I'm hoping,\nwill serve as a\njumping off point.\nWhy questions are always very\ndangerous in biology, or any.\nSAM HARRIS: Or in relationship.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What's that?\nSAM HARRIS: Or in relationship.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOr in relationship.\nRight.\nExactly.\nAlthough, I think it all\ndoes really hearken back\nto this early\ndevelopmental wiring which,\nof course, is modifiable.\nThat's the beauty of\nthe nervous system is,\nit's the one organ that seems\nto be able to change itself\nat least to some degree.\nSo what are your thoughts\nabout the organization\nof the circuitry to essentially\nunder normal conditions to not\nreveal what seems to be one of\nits more important and profound\nand, for dare I say,\nenlightening features.\nIt's almost as if we are\npotentially like mantis shrimp.\nWe can see so many more\ncolors than we actually see.\nAnd yet, we don't.\nMost people opt not to.\nAnd I would argue that\none of the great strengths\nof the Waking Up\napp, for instance,\nis that it essentially walks\nyou through the process of being\nable to arrive at these\nthings without having\nto go to one-year or three-year\nlong silent meditation\nretreats.\nSo if you could just elaborate\nfor a moment before we move on.\nWhat are your thoughts\nabout how the circuitry is\narranged by default versus--\nand what that means for there\nto be an intervention, that we\nhave to intervene in the self\nin order to reveal the self.\nSAM HARRIS: Well, so there\nare two big questions there,\none about evolution and\none about development.\nSo with respect\nto evolution, it's\nimportant to recognize\nthat evolution doesn't\nsee our deepest concerns\nabout human flourishing\nand human well-being.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nall about the offspring.\nSAM HARRIS: We are set up\nto spawn and to survive\nlong enough to help our progeny\nspawn if we can do that.\nAnd that's it.\nAnd so anything that was\ngood for that, including\ntribalism and xenophobia and all\nkinds of hardware and software\nflaws that revealed\nthemselves to be flaws\nin the present time, when\nwe're trying to build\na viable global civilization.\nBut they redounded to the\nadvantage of our ancestors\nsomehow, or there are things\nabout us that were simply not\nselected for, they\njust came along\nfor the ride, what Stephen\nJay Gould called a spandrel.\nSo we are not set\nup by evolution\nto be as happy as\nwe possibly can be\nand to do almost anything\nthat interests us well.\nI mean, we're not\nset up by evolution\nto be mathematicians\nor musicians\nor to create democracies\nthat are healthy.\nI mean, evolution\ncan see none of this.\nAnd we are doing\nthese things based\non cognitive and\nemotional hardware\nthat we are leveraging\nin new directions.\nI mean, we are primates.\nAnd we're communicating\nwith small mouth noises.\nI mean, we're\nlanguage-using primates.\nAnd all of that is\nclearly evolved.\nAnd we're doing these amazing\nthings, including science.\nHowever improbably,\nwhere we're actually\nable to, almost\nentirely with language,\nunderstand reality\nthat at a scale\nthat exceeds us in\nboth directions,\nI mean, the very vast and\nthe very small, and also\ntemporally, the very old.\nWe have visions\nof the far future.\nWe can figure out\nwhere an asteroid\nis going to cross Earth's\norbit 1,000 years from now\nif we just do the math.\nAnd it's amazing that we\ncan do all of those things,\nbut evolution is\nblind to all of that.\nAnd so in terms of what we care\nabout and certainly in terms\nof what's going to ensure\nour survival as a species,\nwe have flown the perch that\nwas created for us by evolution.\nI mean, it's not just\nthe primate things.\nAnd so it is with learning\nhow to regulate our emotions\nand punch through\nto a self concept\nor beyond a self\nconcept that is more\nnormative, psychologically, that\nallows us to not be terrorized\nby our ape-ish genes as\nfully as we seem to be,\neven in the presence of more\nand more destructive technology.\nI mean, we're still\npractically chimpanzees armed\nwith nuclear weapons.\nAnd that is increasingly\ndysfunctional.\nAnd very soon we're going to\nbe in the presence of minds,\nor apparent minds,\nthat we have built\nthat are as\nintelligent as we are\nand very quickly, probably 15\nminutes after that, far more\nintelligent than we are.\nAnd so what we do with all\nof that is, again, something\nthat we have to figure out\nbased on the minds we have,\nthe minds we can build,\nthe minds we can change.\nWe can meddle with\nour own genomes now.\nAnd that will produce\nits own consequences\nin ourselves and in\nfuture generations\nif we meddle with the germline.\nAnd again, all of that\nis just evolution.\nIt's just sort of the\nwomb we came out of,\nbut it didn't\nanticipate any of that.\nMother nature simply not had\nour best interests at heart.\nAnd we might die off, and\nfrom the point of view\nof mother nature that's fine\nbecause 99% of every species\ndies off.\nSo there's that.\nBut when you're talking\nabout the individual,\ndevelopmentally-- we all\ncome into this world,\nagain, as a fairly\nhairless primate\nthat needs a tremendous\namount of care by others.\nAnd the logic of that is\nthat the reason why we're not\na gazelle that can run 45\nminutes later and then,\nbasically, do all the\ngazelle things perfectly soon\nthereafter.\nThe reason why we have\nthis time of immaturity,\nand has become\nfunctional for us,\nis that we're far\nmore flexible, and we\ncan learn based on the needs\nof an environment to do so much\nmore than a gazelle can.\nAnd language is part of that.\nAnd in the last\n10,000 years or so,\nculture increasingly has been\nmore and more a part of that.\nAnd there's probably a layer\nat which we can plausibly\ntalk about cultural evolution\nand cultural evolution\ninteracting with biological\nevolution to change us.\nBut when you're talking\nabout the development\nof an individual, each of us\ncomes into this world, I think,\nnot recognizing\nourselves in any sense\nthat would make sense to reify.\nI mean, it's not that\nthere's nothing there.\nI mean, there could be some kind\nof proto-self differentiation.\nBut I think it\ntakes a long while.\nAnd there is very\nlikely a coincidence\nbetween really\nrecognizing others.\nWe recognize others first.\ncertainly in\nrelationship immediately.\nAnd we orient to human faces.\nAnd we even detect other humans\nas good and bad moral actors\nvery early, I mean,\ncertainly long\nbefore we recognize\nourselves in a mirror.\nThe experiments run, again, this\nis Paul Blume and colleagues,\nexperiments run on the\nmoral hardware and software\nof developing toddlers.\nBut I think at\nthis point, they've\npushed it down all the\nway to six months of age,\nwhere you'll get these infants\nstaring at a puppet show.\nAnd they'll show\na greater interest\nin classically good actors\nversus bad actors, cooperators\nversus defectors, in\nvarious puppet show games.\nSo it's not that we have no\nmind and no proto-awareness\nof others and of self, but\nwhat eventually happens,\ncertainly as we become at\nall facile with language use,\nis that we become aware\nthat not only are we\nin relationship to others,\nbut we are an object\nin the world for them.\nSo we have enough people\npointing at us in our cribs\nand impinging upon\nour experience.\nYou're being physically moved,\nand prodded, and touched,\nand consoled, or not consoled.\nAnd just imagine\nwhat all of these--\nyou're on the receiving end\nof 10,000 interventions.\nAnd you're completely\nhelpless for the longest time.\nAnd all of that\nattention, you have\nall of these people\ncoming up to the crib\nand making faces at you--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nCheering for you.\nSAM HARRIS: And it's\nall pointed at you.\nThere's a classic\nmagical narcissism\nthat gets constructed\nthere if you\ntake the psychological\nliterature, at least\na certain strand\nof it, seriously.\nAnd I think it's largely apt\nto think of a child at that age\nas a kind of--\nthere is a kind of\nnarcissistic structure\nthere, where it's all\nkind of going inward.\nAnd at a certain point\nyou realize, OK, I'm\nthe center of all of this.\nIt's not just a movie where\nyou're completely absorbed in,\nand you've lost\nyour sense of self.\nI mean, to talk to yet\nanother example of what\nit's like as a grown up\nto lose our sense of self.\nAnd one of the things I\nthink we find so fascinating\nabout television and film\nis that when we get totally\nabsorbed in it, we're in this\nvery unusual circumstance where\nour brain is\nbasically reading it\nas we're in the classic\nsocial circumstance.\nWe're presented with the facial\ndisplays of other people.\nIn fact, sometimes these\npeople are 10 feet tall\nor their faces are 10 feet tall.\nYou have a close-up\nin a movie theater.\nSo it's like a super stimulus,\nin terms of evolution.\nAnd they can be making direct\neye contact with a camera,\nso you have this gigantic\nface staring at you.\nAnd yet, you're totally\nuncomplicated socially.\nYou can't be seen.\nAnd something you know\nyou can't be seen.\nAnd so you completely\nlose self consciousness.\nAnd yet, you're able to examine\nwith completely free attention,\nagain, because you're\ntotally unimplicated,\nthe facial minutia and the\nmimetic facial play of people\nat a very close range.\nI mean, you have physically\njust about to kiss your spouse,\nlike that's what a\nclose-up is in a film.\nYou never get that\nclose to people.\nAnd yet, here you're\nin a situation\nwhere you're unobserved.\nAnd you know that.\nAnd so I mean, this\nis a bit of a tangent,\nbut it's the other side\nof what's happening\ndevelopmentally for a kid.\nWhen you're in a movie\ntheater watching a movie,\nyou are truly invisible.\nAnd yet, you're right there.\nHowever harrowing\nthe human drama\nis, you're seeing it play out.\nAnd you're seeing it up close.\nAnd it is, in principle,\na social encounter\nthat your genes are ready\nfor, but they're not ready\nfor you to be invisible.\nAnd so that's what's\nso magical about it.\nBut what happens developmentally\nfor a kid is that you're not\ninvisible, you are an\nobject that is constantly\nbeing overrun, the boundaries\nof your sensory engagement\nwith the world are constantly\nbeing impinged upon by others.\nAnd at a certain point,\nyou recognize, OK, I'm\nat the center of this.\nAnd the way this gets\nenshrined as a self, I think\nis probably coincident\nwith our learning\nthe language game we\nlearn to play with others.\nWe're talking to others.\nPeople are talking to us.\nAnd at a certain point,\nwe're talking to ourselves,\neven when the other\npeople leave the room.\nAnd you can hear it.\nIf you ever have\nbeen with a toddler\nwhen they're externalizing\ntheir self-talk,\nyou hear them talking\nto themselves.\nThey're playing.\nAnd they're having\na conversation.\nThey were talking\nto you, the parent.\nBut then you left the room,\nand they're still talking.\nYou come back in, and\nthey're still talking.\nAnd what happens\nto us, strangely,\nand this comes back to\nthe logic of evolution,\nwe never stop because\nevolution never\nthought to build us an\noff-switch for this.\nI mean, language is so useful.\nAnd it gets tuned up\nso strongly for us.\nAnd there was never a\nreason to shut it off.\nThere was never a reason\nto give you this ability\nto say, oh, wouldn't it be nice\nto have four hours of quiet\nnow, like no self-talk.\nAnd so for most of\nus, I mean, I think\nthere are people who, for\nwhatever neurological reason\nor idiosyncratic reason,\nundoubtedly there'd\nbe a neurological reason for\nit, don't have any self-talk.\nBut for most of\nus, we are covertly\ntalking basically all the time.\nAnd there's an\nimagistic component\nof this for many people.\nYou're visualizing\nthings as well.\nBut there's just a ton of\nwhite noise in the mind that\nfeels a certain way.\nAnd what you discover\nin meditation,\nultimately, is that\nthe self is what\nit feels like to be\nthinking without knowing\nthat you're thinking.\nA thought arises uninspected\nand seems to just become you.\nLike you and I are talking now.\nAnd people are listening to us.\nThey're struggling to follow\nthe train of this conversation\nbecause it is competing\nwith the conversation that's\nhappening in their heads.\nSo I'll be saying something.\nAnd a person listening will\nsay, well, what does that mean?\nOr like, oh, but wait a minute,\nhe just contradicted himself.\nAnd there's a voice\nin your head that\nis also vying for your\nattention much of the time.\nSo the first discovery\npeople make in meditation\nis that it's just so\nhard to pay attention\nto anything, the breath,\nor a mantra, or a sound,\nwhatever it is, because\nyou're thinking.\nYou're thinking about the thing\nyou need to do in an hour.\nAnd oh, it's so good that\nI downloaded this app.\nThis is really good.\nThis is going to be good for me.\nBut that chatter\nisn't showing up.\nYou're not far back enough in\nthe theater of consciousness,\nso as to see it emerge.\nIt is just sneaking\nup behind you.\nAnd it feels like me again.\nIt feels like when someone is\nthinking the thought, well,\nwhat the hell does that mean?\nThey're not seeing\nit as an emerging\nobject in consciousness.\nIt just feels like me.\nSubjectively, is like\nthe mind contracts\naround this appearance\nin consciousness.\nAnd it really is just a sound\nwith the voice of the mind.\nIf you actually can inspect\nit, it is deeply inscrutable\nthat we ever feel identified\nwith our thoughts.\nI mean, how is it that\nwe could be a thought?\nA thought just arises\nand passes away.\nAnd when you inspect it,\nwhen you go to inspect it,\nit unravels.\nIt's the least substantial\npossible thing.\nBut yet, it could be a\nthought of self-hatred.\nIt could be a thought,\nthat unrecognized,\ntotally defines your mood.\nI mean, again, this all\ncan seem kind of abstract.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, no, but I think\nit's extremely concrete\nfrom the perspective\nof the neural circuits\nthat will return\nto maybe in a few minutes.\nI'd like to take a\nbrief break and thank\nour sponsor Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help me better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a lot\nof blood and DNA tests\nout there. however,\nis that you get data\nback about metabolic factors,\nlipids, and hormones,\nand so forth, but you don't\nknow what to do with those data.\nInside Tracker\nsolves that problem\nand makes it very easy\nfor you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation-based\ninterventions,\nyou might want to\ntake on in order\nto adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors, hormones,\nlipids, and other\nthings that impact\nyour immediate and long-term\nhealth to bring those numbers\ninto the ranges\nthat are appropriate\nand indeed optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Inside Tracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nand get 20% off any of\nInside Tracker's plans.\nThat's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nIf you could elaborate a bit on\nthis notion of internal chatter\nand external stimuli and\nthe bridge between them\nbecause I think for some\npeople that might be intuitive.\nI think for others,\nit's not so obvious\nthat language is\nongoing in the backdrop.\nAnd then sometimes, I\nthink some people are\nmore tuned into that language.\nFor some people,\nit's louder volume.\nFor some people,\nit's more structured.\nI have a colleague\nat Stanford who's\nbeen on this podcast\ncalled Deisseroth.\nHe's one of, like, the\npreeminent bioengineers.\nHe's also a psychiatrist.\nAnd he has a--\nhe doesn't call it a\nmeditative practice,\nbut he has a practice\nwhere each evening,\nafter his five kids are put\ndown to sleep, you know--\nthey're older now--\nand in the quiet of the\nlate hours of the night,\nearly morning, he\nsits and forces\nhimself to think in\ncomplete sentences,\nwith punctuation, for an hour.\nThis is the way that he has\ntaught himself to structure\nhis thinking, because of\nthe very fact that you're\ndescribing, which is\nthat ordinarily, there\nis an underlying structure\nto what's internal,\nbut it's disrupted by external\nevents, And these are--\ntypically, it's\nnot coherent enough\nto really make meaning from.\nSo it's almost like\nsomebody sitting down\nto write in complete\nsentences, but forcing\nhimself to do it in his head.\nBut for many people,\nincluding myself,\nthat's a foreign experience.\nAnd we only experience structure\nthrough our interactions\nwith the world and other people.\nI've taken the time to try and\nexplore ideas with eyes closed.\nAnd I've been able to do that.\nThere are certain\npharmacologic states\nthat we could talk about\nthat facilitate that.\nAnd no, those are\nnot amphetamines.\nThose do exactly the\nopposite, by the way.\nBut I think people\nexist in varying degrees\nof structured and unstructured\ninternal dialogue,\nand in varying\ndepths of recognition\nof that internal dialogue.\nAnd so the question,\nI suppose, is,\njust the recognition that\nthere's a dialogue ongoing,\ninternally-- is that,\nitself, valuable?\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nAnd that also can\ntake some time.\nSo, I mean, here's\na claim I would\nmake that some people\nmight find surprising.\nBut I think this is an\nobjectively true claim about\nthe subjectivity of most people,\nwhich is that unless you have\na fair amount of training--\nlet's say you just happen to be\nsome kind of savant in this\narea, which most people,\nby definition, aren't, or\nyou have a remarkable amount\nof training in what's called\nconcentration practice\nin meditation--\nI believe this is a true claim--\nthat if we just put a stopwatch\non this table, and people\ncould just watch it 30 seconds\nelapse, and I set all of our\nlisteners, or your viewers,\nthe task, for the\nnext 30 seconds,\njust pay attention to anything--\nyour breath, you know,\nor the sight of your hand,\nor the sight of the clock,\nor any object--\nwithout getting lost in thought,\nwithout getting momentarily\ndistracted by this conversation\nyou're having with yourself.\nA couple of things would happen.\nOne is no one would be\nable to do it, right?\nAnd this is not just a\nsuperficial inability.\nI mean, if your\nlife depended on it,\nyou wouldn't be able to do it.\nI mean, if the fate of\ncivilization depended on it,\nnone of our listeners\nwould be able to do this.\nAnd yet, some percentage of them\nare so distracted by thought\nthat they will actually\ntry this experiment\nand think they succeeded.\nRight?\nAnd for these people,\nwhat happens is\nyou put them on a\nmeditation retreat,\nand you have them\nspend 12 hours a day\nin silence, doing\nnothing but this.\nRight?\nSo the practice is just\npay attention to the breath\nwhen they're sitting,\nand then eventually, you\nincorporate everything--\nsounds and other sensations.\nAnd then you interleave that\nwith walking meditation, where\nthey're paying attention just\nto the sensations of lifting\nand moving and\nplacing their feet.\nAnd then once the\npractice is going,\nyou incorporate sounds\nand sights and everything.\nSo you can pay\nattention to everything,\nbut the goal is,\nfor every moment,\nyou are going to cultivate\nthis faculty of mind,\nwhich increasingly is\nknown as mindfulness.\nRight?\nAnd mindfulness is nothing\nother than this very careful\nattention to the contents\nof consciousness.\nBut the crucial\npiece is it is not\na moment of being\nlost in thought.\nRight?\nYou're not blocking thoughts.\nThoughts themselves can arise.\nBut in those moments\nof being truly mindful,\nyou're noticing\nthoughts as thoughts.\nWhether it's language\nin the mind or images,\nyou're noticing those, too,\nas spontaneous appearances\nin consciousness.\nSo if most people-- you know,\ncertainly anyone who thinks\nthey can pay attention to--\nwho can do the experiment\nsuccessfully that I just\nsuggested-- pay attention\nto something for 30 seconds\nwithout being lost in thought--\nyou put those people on a\nmeditation retreat, what\nthey're going to experience\nis, you know, on the first day,\nthey're going to\nfeel, like, oh, yeah.\nI was with the breath, or\nI was walking-- you know,\nI was with the\nsensations of walking--\nand I'd be there for, like,\nfive minutes solid, and then\nI would get lost in thought.\nAnd then I'd come back.\nAnd then five more minutes,\nI'd be lost in thought,\nand then get back.\nBut as the days progressed--\neven, you know, 10 days in to\na silent meditation retreat--\nthey're going to experience\nmore and more distraction.\nIt's going to seem\nlike, OK, wait a minute.\nNow I can't pay\nattention to anything\nfor more than 5 seconds.\nRight?\nThat is progress, right?\nBecause what they're discovering\nis just how distractible\nthey are.\nRight?\nAnd you know, for\nsome people, that\nwill be immediately obvious.\nFor some people, it'll\nactually take a lot of practice\nto realize just how\ndistracted they are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What you\njust said, which was that,\nat some point, we can start\nnoticing our thoughts--\nI can notice my thoughts--\nbut what you're talking about,\nas a goal state, is not\nbeing distracted by thoughts,\nbut actually seeing\nthe relationship\nbetween thoughts, self, and\nother types of perceptions.\nAnd here, I think recognizing\nand seeing thoughts\nis a form of perception.\nIt's just an\ninternally-directed perception.\nThis raises a topic that\nI'm also obsessed by,\nwhich I think neuroscience\ncan somewhat explain,\nbut still incompletely--\nthat the circuits and\nmechanics, et cetera,\nare not yet known-- which\nis about time perception.\nAnd you know, a\nsimple analogy would\nbe that there are a lot of\nsmall objects flying around\nin the space that we happen\nto be having this discussion,\nbut they're moving so fast\nthat I can't perceive them.\nOr they're entirely stationary,\nso I can't perceive them\nbecause of the reasons\nwe talked about\nbefore in the visual system.\nMy eyes are moving\nin perfect concert\nwith these small\nobject movements,\nand therefore, I\nam blind to them.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A slight\nshift in time perception--\nthink of this, perhaps, as\na change in the frame rate,\nright?\nCamera frame rates.\nA faster frame rate, you\ncan capture slow motion.\nSlower frame rate,\nyou're going to get\nmore of a strobe-type effect if\nthe frame rate is low enough.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right?\nCould it be that our time\nperception is not one thing,\nbut we have one rate of\nperceiving time for external\nobjects at a given distance--\nwhich we know is true--\nanother frame rate for\nobjects that are up close-- we\nknow this to be true, even\nif those objects are moving\nat the exact same speed, right?\nI mean, this would be\nthe sitting on a train,\nthe rungs on the fence seem to\nbe going by very, very fast,\nbut the ones in the distance\nseem to be moving slowly.\nThis is the way the visual\nsystem and time perception\ninterconnect at some level.\nYou're up on a skyscraper--\nthe little ants\nof cars and people down below.\nYou know they're moving\nmuch faster than you\nperceive them to move, but\nit's a distance effect.\nSAM HARRIS: I mean,\nyou see a plane,\nit's going to be going\n300 miles an hour.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd it's not because\nof the lack of resolution.\nThe lack of resolution\nis incidental.\nWe know this because in\nanimals, such as hawks,\nthat have twice the degree\nof acuity, as far as we know,\nthey have the same\ndistance-associated shifts\nin time perception.\nSo could it be\nthat we are running\nmultiple streams of time\nperception, multiple cones\nof attention, that include cones\nof attention to our thoughts,\nand that somehow,\nthrough meditation,\nwe start to align the frame\nrate for these different streams\nof attention so that they\nall fall into the same movie,\nif you will--\nalthough it's not just\na movie with visual content.\nWhat I'm doing here\nis clearly, I'm\nbecoming a lumper\nrather than a spreader.\nI'm sure this violates certain\nrules of time perception\nand neural circuitry,\nbut I'm not sure\nthat it's entirely\nuntrue, either.\nAnd does it survive at\nall, as a possible model\nfor what you're describing?\nAnd if the answer\nis no, I'm perfectly\ncomfortable with that.\nSAM HARRIS: Well, it's dependent\non what you mean by meditation.\nThis is where, sort\nof, the particularities\nof what one is doing\nwith one's attention\nunder the frame of\nmeditation really\nmatter, because there are\nways to practice mindfulness,\nin particular, where\nthe frame rate really\ndoes seem to go way, way up.\nRight?\nAnd there's actually been\nsome research done on this,\nwhere you take people before\nand after a three-month silent\nmeditation retreat, and you\ngive them some kind of visual\ndiscrimination task where\nthey have to detect--\nI think they used\na tachistoscope.\nIs that the tool for?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'm not familiar.\nSAM HARRIS: Something\nthat presents, you know,\nvery quick pulses of light.\nAnd in any case, just\nin any sensory channel,\nI would imagine you can make\nfiner-grained discriminations\nif you're practicing mindfulness\nin a very specific way, which\nis to be making these\nfine-grained discriminations\nmore and more, and do nothing\nelse for three months, which\nis a way of practicing.\nSo the classic\nmindfulness practice\nin what's called\nVipassana meditation\nis to pay scrupulous attention\nto seeing, hearing, smelling,\ntasting, touching in a way\nthat breaks everything down\ninto these kind of\nmicroscopic sensory moments.\nSo you know, rather than feel\nyour hands pressing together,\nwhat you're trying to\nfeel with your attention\nand you're feeling\nmore and more is\nall of the sensations of\npressure and temperature\nand movement such that\nthe feeling of hands\ncompletely disappears.\nYou realize that a\nhand is a concept,\nand all you have is this cloud\nof punctate and very brief\nsensations.\nAnd so anything you think you\nhave as a datum of experience,\nas you bore into it\nwith your attention,\nit resolves into this kind of\ndiaphanous cloud of changing\nsensation.\nAnd that can be even something\nas captivating as, like,\na serious pain in your body.\nI mean, you can have could have\ninjured your neck, you know?\nAnd so you have some\nexcruciating pain in your neck.\nIf you just are willing to\npay attention to it, you know,\nand just pay 100% attention to\nit, a couple of things happen.\nOne is your resistance\nto feeling it goes away,\nby definition, because now your\ngoal is to just pay attention\nto it.\nAnd you recognize that so much\nof the suffering associated\nwith the pain was borne of\nthe resistance to feeling it.\nYou're bracing against it and\nall of your thinking about it,\nyou know?\nYou're thinking,\nlike, well, you know,\nwhy did I do this to\nmyself, or should I\nsee an orthopedist, or how\nlong is this going to last?\nAnd maybe I herniated a disk.\nLike, all of that self-talk\nis producing anxiety.\nAnd I'm not saying there's never\nanything to think about there.\nBut either you can do something\nabout it in the moment or you\ncan't.\nAnd so much of our suffering\nin the presence of pain is\nthe result of resisting it,\nworrying about it, thinking--\njust all of the--\neverything we're\ndoing with our minds,\nbut just feeling it, right?\nSo when you just\nfeel it, again, it\nbreaks apart into this\never shifting collection\nof different sensations.\nAnd it's not one thing, and\nit never stays the same.\nSo two things happen there.\nOne is there can be a\ntremendous amount of relief that\nhappens there where you can\nachieve a level of equanimity,\neven in the presence of really\nunpleasant physical sensation.\nAnd this is true of\nmental sensation as well.\nAs it's true of emotions.\nThe classically\nnegative emotions\nlike anger, depression, or fear.\nThe moment you become\nwilling to just feel them\nin all of their punctate\nand changeable qualities,\nthey cease to be what\nthey were a moment ago.\nWhen you're talking\nabout emotional states,\nthey cease to map back on\nto you and your self concept\nas meaningful in the same way.\nSo that suddenly, the\nanxiety you feel, let's say,\nbefore going out on stage to\ngive a talk, a moment ago,\nit had psychological meaning,\nit felt like, I'm anxious.\nHow do I get rid of this?\nWhy am I this sort of person?\nShould I have taken\na beta blocker?\nThis is the conversation\nyou're having with yourself.\nThe moment you just\nbecome willing to feel it\nas the pure energy of the\nphysiology of cortisol release,\nit ceases to have any meaning.\nIt ceases to be a\nproblem in that moment,\nbecause it's no more--\nit no more maps onto\nthe kind of person\nyou are then a feeling\nof indigestion or a pain\nin your knee maps onto the\nkind of person you are.\nIt's just sensation, anyway.\nBack to the main\npoint here, which\nis that, if you train\nyour attention in this way\nto notice the particularities\nof sensory experience\nand emotional experience,\nyou're looking\nfor the atoms of experience.\nYou get better and better at\nthat and certain things happen.\nBut one thing that I\nreally do think happens\nis there's a kind of frame\nrate change in the data stream\nwhere you really are just--\nyou're just noticing much,\nmuch more.\nAll of that is a very\ninteresting way of training.\nIt's not what I tend\nto recommend now.\nIt's a great\npreliminary practice\nfor what I do recommend,\nbecause it really\nteaches you the difference\nbetween being lost in thought\nand not, it really teaches\nyou what mindfulness is.\nBut it tends to be done by 99.9%\nof people in a dualistic way,\nwhich, again, you're set\nup to think, OK, I'm over\nhere as the locus of attention.\nAnd I'm continually getting\ndistracted by thought.\nAnd the project is to not\ndo that anymore and actually\npay attention to the breath\nand sounds and sensations.\nAnd every time I\nget lost in thought,\nI'm going to go back here.\nBut this whole dance\nof I'm lost in thought,\nnow I'm strategically directing\nmy attention again, all of this\nseems to ramify\nthis sense of self.\nThe of there's one\nto be doing this.\nThere's somebody holding\nthe spotlight of attention\nand getting better\nat coming back\nto the object of meditation.\nAgain, it's inevitable\nthat 99.9% of people\nare going to start\nthere and stay there\nfor some considerable\nperiod of time.\nBut the thing I like to do\nwhen I talk about all of this\nis undercut the false\nassumptions that are anchoring\nall of that as\nearly as possible,\nbecause where, I\nthink, you want to be\nis recognizing that there\nis no place from which\nto aim attention.\nThis whole dualistic setup\nof subject and object\nis the thing that is\nalready not there.\nAnd it's not that it's there\nand you meditate it out\nof existence successfully.\nIt's really not there.\nAnd if you learn\nhow to look for it,\nyou can see that it's not there\nand feel that it's not there.\nAnd it no longer\nseems to be there.\nIt's like it's not--\nand it becomes like, again,\nlike a bi-stable percept where\nyou looked at it long\nenough and you thought,\nOK, now I see the vase and\nthe face and I can't unsee it.\nAnd every time I look,\nit's there again, right?\nSo yeah.\nSo to come back\nto the example you\ngave with your\ncolleague at Stanford\nwhose book I know I have.\nI haven't read it.\nThis is a-- he wrote\na book, Projections.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSAM HARRIS: So it's\non my stack to read.\nBut it's the opposite--\nwhat I'm recommending\nis, essentially,\nthe opposite end\nof the continuum\nof the internal\nexercise he was doing.\nSo rather than-- so\nhe's doing something\nvery deliberate and controlled,\nand he is deliberately\nthinking in complete\nsentences and commandeering\nthe machinery of thought\nand attention in a way\nthat I would imagine.\nI mean, I'd be interested\nto talk to him about it.\nBut I would imagine, he really\nfeels like he's doing that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHe's an engineer--\nas you've describe it in\nthis way, it reminds me,\nhe's a physician, but\nhe's also an engineer.\nSo it's really about\ntaking the raw materials\nof thought and engineering\nsomething structured from it.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nRight.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I haven't\nbeen in Carl's mind.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nBut if we got him\ntalking on that,\nI'm sure we would get\na sense of what it is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We'll do that\nconversation at some point.\nIt's the exact opposite\nof what you're describing.\nSAM HARRIS: Exact\nopposite would be\nto recognize that the sense of\ncontrol is a total illusion.\nBecause you don't know what\nyou're going to think next.\nAnd even he, in the most\nlaborious way, I mean,\nhe could just get as\nmuscular as he wants with it.\nHe still doesn't know what\nhe's going to think next.\nBecause thoughts simply arise.\nYou can run this\nexperiment for yourself.\nAnd this connects up to\nthe topic of free will\nwhich we might want to touch.\nBut I mean, just think\nof any category of thing.\nIf I asked you to think\nof the names of cities\nor of friends you have or of\nfamous people you can remember\nexist or think of\nnouns or anything.\nAnd just watch what\ncomes percolating\ninto consciousness right now.\nThere are things\nyou can't think of,\nthere are things you\ndon't know the name of.\nThere are languages\nyou don't speak,\nthere are famous people you've\nnever seen or never heard of.\nSo you have no control\nover that part.\nLike those names\nand faces are not\ngoing to suddenly come\nstreaming into consciousness.\nBut the totality of\nfacts and figures\nand faces and names\nthat you do know,\nonly some will come\nvying for inclusion.\nAnd there's a sort of--\nwe could make guess\nand we know something\nabout the neurology of this.\nBut you depending\non what channel\nyou're waiting for\nthoughts in, I mean,\nit's going to be\ndifferent if it's visual\nor semantic or episodic memory.\nI mean, all of these\nthings are different.\nBut wherever you\npoint your inner\ngaze of attention and wait\nfor the next face or name.\nCertain things are going\nto come and certain things\naren't going to come.\nAnd how you land on one--\nthere'll be this process\nif you're paying attention,\nyou might think, let's say we\ngo with names of cities, right?\nSo you'll think of Paris,\nyou'll think of London,\nyou'll think of Rome,\nyou'll think of Sedona.\nSo these names will come.\nAnd if I ask you to\njust say one, right?\nSo just--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Minneapolis\nis what came to mind.\nFor me, it was very\nstraightforward.\nIt was Minneapolis, the\nfamous person was Joe Strummer\nand they just like--\nI can give you reasons why\nI think those came to mind.\nRecent conversations.\nSAM HARRIS: OK.\nSo we know a fair bit\nabout much of this.\nSo one, we know that\nyour reasons, obviously,\ncould be right or wrong.\nThey're very likely\nto be wrong because we\nhave this confabulatory\nstorytelling mechanism even\nin an intact brain\nwhere we just--\nwe seem to never\nlack for the reasons\nwhy something came\nto mind, and we\ncan know we can\nmanipulate people\nin ways that prove that\npeople are just reliably\nwrong and confident.\nYou know, confidently\nso about the reasons\nwhy they thought of\nthings or did things.\nBut leaving that aside, even\nif you're completely accurate,\nthere are people's\nnames who you know\nand cities names that you\nknow that inexplicably just\ndidn't come to mind.\nAnd if we ran this\nexperiment again and again\nand again, they\nwouldn't come to mind\nif your brain was in\nprecisely the state\nit was in a moment ago.\nIf we could return\nyour brain to the state\nit was in a moment\nago, correcting\nfor all the deterministic\nchanges and all\nthe random changes that would\nhave to be corrected for,\nit to just get--\nall the synapses\nand the synaptic weights\nand everything in the state\nit was in to produce Joe\nStrummer in Minneapolis.\nIf we rewind that movie, that\npart of the movie of your life,\nyou are going to say Joe\nStrummer in Minneapolis\na trillion times in a row.\nSo this is why, in my view,\nthe notion of free will\nmakes absolutely no sense.\nAnd you can add as much\nrandomness to that process\nas you want.\nIt still doesn't get you the\nfreedom people think they have.\nThere's another conversation\nto have about why none of that\nmatters and why\nthings only get better\nonce you admit to yourself\nthat free will is an illusion.\nAnd yes, you can get in\nshape and you can diet\nand you can do all the\nthings you want to do\nand you don't have to\nthink about free will.\nBut from a contemplative,\nmeditative point of view,\nthe thing to notice is\nthat everything is just\nspringing into view.\nThere's no place from\nwhich you are authoring\nyour next thought, because\nyou would have to think it\nbefore you think it.\nLike there is just this\nfundamental mystery\nat our backs that is disgorging\neverything that we experience.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhat if I'm speaking?\nSo if I'm talking\nabout something\nand I have some command\nof that information,\nI can often sense what I'm\ngoing to say next and then\nfind myself saying it.\nAnd hopefully, that's what they\nsay and not something else.\nI certainly said things\nI didn't intend to say\nor never thought I\nwould say in life.\nBut when engaged in\nspeech or action,\nit at least gives us\nthe illusion, I think,\nthat we somehow have more\ncommand over our thoughts.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nWell you have a script.\nI mean, it's like there are\nthings you know a lot about\nand you've talked\nabout them a lot,\nand you know you\nhave the things you\nwant to say about those\nthings and the things\nyou don't want to say or\nyou wouldn't want to say.\nAnd you know you can--\nit still is a bit of a high wire\nact, because you can misspeak\nor you can fail to get\nto the end of a sentence\nin a grammatically correct way.\nAnd again, all of this--\nobjectively, this whole process\nis mysterious to you.\nYou don't know how you follow\nthe rules of English grammar.\nLike your tongue is doing it\nsomehow and when it fails,\nit fails, and you're just\nas surprised as the next guy\nthat it failed.\nAnd you mispronounce\na word, and OK, I\ndon't know what happened there.\nBut if it keeps happening, I'm\ngoing to worry I had a stroke.\nAnd if it stops, I'm not\ngoing to worry about it.\nSo it's still\nmysterious even when\nyou're doing it in a very rote,\ndeliberative, and repetitive\nway.\nBut when you're\ntalking about something\nyou've talked about a\nlot and you know where\nyou're going to go, right?\nWe have many\nconversations like this,\nit is somewhat analogous\nto like a golf swing.\nWhere it's like, you know\nhow you want to do it,\nit's going to be\nall kinds of errors\nthat are going to creep\ninto your execution of it\nin real time.\nBut there's like you,\nbasically, have a pattern.\nAnd so you have certain\nlinguistic patterns\nwhich you're following.\nAgain, none of this is\na proof of free will,\nbut I will grant you that\nphenomenologically, it\nfeels different than just\nwaiting for the next thought\nto come.\nBut my point is that,\neven if you are--\nI mean, you can trim it down\nto the simplest possible thing.\nLike you take two things\nyou like to drink.\nYou like coffee\nand you like tea.\nAnd you're deciding\nwhich to have.\nBoth are on offer.\nYou've got two cups\nin front of you.\nAnd the question is,\nhere I've got water\nand I've got coffee, which\nam I going to drink next?\nIncredibly, it's as simple\nas possible decision.\nAnd no matter how long I\nmake this decision process,\nI could literally sit for\nan hour trying to figure out\nwhich to reach for next.\nAnd I could have my\nreasons why, and I\ncould have all my self talk.\nThere's going to be a\nfinal change in me that's\ngoing to be the proximate\ncause of me deciding one\nover the other.\nAnd that, no matter\nhow laborious\nI can make it seem in terms\nof my reasoning about it,\nit is going to be fundamentally\nmysterious as to why I went\nwith one rather than the other.\nWhatever story I have--\nbecause it's like-- it's still\ngoing to be as mysterious\nas you thinking of Joe\nStrummer when you absolutely--\nyou know of the existence of\nMarilyn Monroe just as much.\nAnd yet she simply\ndidn't occur to you.\nIt's fundamentally mysterious.\nLike there are people who\nare even more famous than Joe\nStrummer to you.\nI mean, I'm sure he may be\nsomebody who you have thought\na lot about, but\nthere are people\nwho like if we could just\ninventory your conscious life\ngoing back the last\n10 years, there\nare people who you've thought\nabout more than Joe Strummer\nyet they didn't appear.\nAnd that is mysterious.\nAnd they could have,\nbut they didn't.\nWhat I'm saying is that\nthis mystery never gets\nbanished in our experience.\nWhatever stories.\nWe have to tell about it.\nBecause if the story is, oh,\nwell, I went for the water\nbecause I think I've been\ndrinking too much coffee.\nI listen to Andrew\nHuberman's podcast\nand he was talking about\ncaffeine, and I think--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's good for us,\nbut you don't want to overdo it.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSAM HARRIS: OK.\nSo let's say that is,\nactually, the causal chain.\nLike, I listen to\nyour podcast, you\nsay something\nabout caffeine, now\nI'm self conscious\nabout my coffee intake.\nBut that's just adding a\ncouple of links to the chain.\nThere's still this\nfundamental mystery of, well,\nwhy did I find that persuasive?\nAnd why did I find it persuasive\nnow and not five minutes ago\nwhen I was drinking the coffee?\nLike why did I just remember it\nnow, or why was it effective?\nYou only have-- your\nexperience in every moment\nis precisely what it is\nand not one bit more.\nAnd this subsumes even moments\nof real resolve and effort\nand picking yourself\nup by your bootstraps\nand changing everything.\nIt's like you're on\na diet and you're\ntempted to eat chocolate.\nAnd you think you're\nabout to reach\nand say, no, I'm not\nbreaking this diet.\nThis diet is actually\ngoing to stick.\nWhy did that arise in\nthat moment and not\nat this analogous moment\non your last diet?\nAnd why did it arise now\nto precisely the degree\nthat it did?\nWhy will it be as\neffective as it\nwill be and have the\nhalf-life that it will\nhave and not 10% more or less.\nAll of those are always\nmysterious to you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, could\nwe give, as we did before,\nan evolutionary and a\ndevelopmental explanation?\nAn evolutionary\nexplanation might\nbe that directed attention\nand action is metabolically\ndemanding.\nIt would be inefficient\nor impossible\nfor us to be in constant,\ndeliberate action with access\nto all the relevant information\nas to why we would do anything.\nSo our ideas, literally,\nspring to the surface\nat the last possible\nmoment in order\nto offset the great metabolic\nrequirements of having ideas\nthat are related to\ngoal-directed action\nor that goal-directed\naction is expensive.\nThat's one idea.\nThe other idea would\nbe-- and we know\nthis as a fact, which is\nthat, initially, the brain is\nfairly crudely wired.\nThat's not true within the\nneural circuits that control\nbreathing, heart\nrate, et cetera,\nbut within the neural circuits\nof sensory perception, thought,\net cetera.\nThey're fairly crudely wired.\nAnd then across\ndevelopment, there's\na progressive pruning\nback and also in parallel\nto that, a strengthening\nof the connections\nthat underlie directed\naction and thought.\nAnd here, I don't mean directed\nas in free will, I mean,\njust that I can decide\nto imagine an apple\nand imagine that\napple, for instance.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nBut your decision--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere seems to be\nsome maintenance of the fine\nrandom wiring in systems.\nI mean, we've seen\nthis even in worms,\nin flies, in so-called lower\ninvertebrates and lower\nvertebrates.\nAnd we see this in humans.\nAnd it seems to be that\nthere's a lot of background\nspontaneous activity.\nI mean, I've sunk electrodes\ninto the brains of humans,\nmacaques, carnivores, and mice.\nAnd in every case, most of\nwhat you hear is called hash\nand it has nothing\nto do with hashish.\nIs just [VOCALIZING]\non the audio monitor\nwhich is picking up a\nbunch of action potentials.\nAs you're listening to a\nchorus of action potentials.\nBut it's rare to find a neuron\nthat faithfully [VOCALIZING]\nfires to represent some\nsensory stimulus in the world.\nAnd you can arrange that\nmarriage experimentally\nso that you can arrive at those\nstrong signal to noise events.\nBut I was always struck\nby how much noise there\nis in the system all\naround all the time.\nAnd people argue, is the\nnoise really noise, et cetera?\nThere's still a lot\nof debate about that.\nBut I can imagine that some\nof the spontaneous nature\nof thoughts just\nrelates to the fact\nthat there's a lot of\nbackground spontaneous activity\nin the brain.\nNow, why that is a\nwhole other discussion.\nBut if I were to set up two\nconstraints that there's\na lot of spontaneous\nactivity, it's\ngoing to generate\nrandom thoughts.\nThankfully, not\nmuch random action,\nalthough there's a little bit\nof random action in our daily\nlives.\nAnd then against that say,\nwell, any deliberate thought\nor motion is going\nto be expensive.\nIt's a metabolically\nexpensive organ to begin with.\nAnd so you just have to--\nevolution has arrived at a place\nwhere spontaneous geysering up\nof things upon which like\ndeliberate thoughts and action\nare superimposed is\nthe best arrangement\noverall for this very\nmetabolically demanding organ.\nI mean, what I\nbasically gave was just\nkind of a biological description\nof just one narrow aspect\nof it.\nBut can we get\ncomfortable with that?\nAnd the reason I say get\ncomfortable is that I'm--\nand here, admittedly,\nI'm forcing a little bit\nof a striptease\ntowards what I think I\nand everyone else wants to\nknow, which is how to meditate\nand why, in particular,\nmeditation convinces us\nthat something\ndoesn't necessarily\nhave to be eliminated, but\nthat was actually never there.\nI feel like we've now set\nup a sort of almost like a--\nyou're not contradicting\nyourself by any means,\nbut in my mind, there's\na contradiction.\nAnd here's the contradiction.\nI love this statement\nthat meditation over time\nor done properly reveals\nto us that we're actually\nnot trying to make the gap\nbetween actor and observer\ngo away.\nIt was actually never there.\nTo me, that's one of the\nmore important statements\nthat I, perhaps,\nhave ever heard.\nAnd it inspires me to go further\ndown this path of meditation,\nbecause I've never\nexperienced that.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not\ndeliberately, and certainly,\nnot through meditation.\nIf I ever experienced it,\nit was transient enough\nthat I'm intrigued to\nexperience it more.\nSo on the one hand,\nyou're telling me\nsomething was never there.\nAnd there's a\nprofound experience\nto be heard by anyone that's\nwilling to do the work\nto arrive at that experience\nof the loss of that illusion.\nOn the other hand, I'm\nhearing that there's\na profound gap that\nreally does exist,\nwhich is that we believe\nthat our thoughts are somehow\nfrom us.\nAnd indeed, they're from in the\ncranial vault someplace, maybe,\nin the body a bit as well.\nBut that we over attribute the\ndegree to which we are that\nand that is us in a way that's\nvolitional, that we control.\nAnd so once I'm hearing\nthat there's something--\nthere's an illusion that we can\neliminate and on the other hand\nI'm hearing that there's\nan illusion that we can't\neliminate, and maybe\nthese are unrelated\nand I'm bridging them in\nan unimportant way, that\nseems only important to me.\nBut somehow, I can't\nresolve these two\nand maybe the thing\nto do then is, can we\nseparate them in terms of\na practice to witness them?\nThat would allow us to\nresolve them separately.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nSo I think I'm\nhearing the problem.\nThere's this-- let me bracket\nthe whole free will discussion\nbecause it really is the flip\nside of this coin that I'm--\nthe obverse of which is\nthe illusion of the self.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So at least--\nI might be on the right track.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They are\nthe opposite sides of a coin.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nGreat.\nBecause to me they seem\nvery different in essence.\nSAM HARRIS: No.\nBecause what I'm calling\nthe sense of self\nand what I think\nmost people feel\nas their core sense of\nself is this feeling of--\nI mean, it's the feeling of\nbeing the locus of attention,\nbut it's also the feeling of\nbeing the locus of agency.\nI can do the next thing.\nLike, who's doing this?\nWho's reaching for the cup?\nI am.\nRight?\nI intended this, and\nnow I'm doing the thing.\nAnd my conscious intention\nis the proximate cause\nof my reaching, right?\nAnd so I'm the author of\nmy thoughts and actions,\nessentially.\nAnd my specific uses\nof attention, right?\nSo I can pay attention to the\nbreath, I get lost in thought,\nI come back to the breath.\nBut on some level, the thoughts\nthemselves are more of my\ndoing something with\nalmost authorial intent.\nLike I'm thinking like, what the\nhell is this guy talking about?\nWho's thinking these thoughts?\nI am.\nThe person who really\ndoesn't get what I'm saying\nis thinking something like that.\nWhat the fuck is this\nguy talking about?\nI know I'm here.\nI'm a self, I'm a\nbody, I'm a mind.\nI can reach for things.\nThat these intentional\nactions are\ndifferent from things\nthat happen to me.\nA voluntary action is different\nfrom an involuntary one.\nSo having a tremor is\ndifferent from consciously\ndeciding to pick up a glass.\nSo obviously, everything\nI'm saying about meditation\nand the self and\nfree will in order\nto be a sane picture of a\nhuman mind and of reality\nhas to conserve the\ndata of experience\nsuch that, yes,\nI can acknowledge\nthe difference between a tremor\nand a deliberative voluntary\nmotor action.\nAnd the things you\ndo volitionally\nare different not just\npsychologically and\nbehaviorally, but they just\nhave different implications\nfor like in a court of law.\nYou accidentally hit\nsomeone with your car\nor you did it on\npurpose, that's still\na distinction that matters.\nImportantly, it tells us a lot\nabout the global properties\nof your mind such that we\nhave a sense of what you're\nlikely to do in the future.\nIf you're someone who\nlikes running over people\nwith your car,\nyou're a psychopath\nwho we need to worry about.\nIf you're is someone\nwho did it by accident,\nwell then you may be culpable\nfor the level of negligence\nthat allow that to happen.\nBut you're a very different\nperson and we you differently\nand we're wise to.\nSo anyway, we can\nbracket all of that.\nThere's this-- I mean,\nthere are some fundamental--\nthere are some false\nassumptions about the underlying\nlogic of this process, which,\nI think, is worth addressing.\nIs actually-- there was a kind\nof found object in the news\nthat I talk about at one point.\nI forget where it\nis in Waking Up app.\nBut there was a story that\nI stumbled on the internet.\nI think it's about\n12 or 13 years old.\nOf a tourist bus in--\nI think it was in Norway.\nIt was somewhere\nin Northern Europe.\nAnd it had about\n30 people on it.\nAnd one person was\ndescribed as an Asian woman.\nAnd they went to a rest stop\nand everyone got off the bus.\nAnd shopped and had lunch.\nAnd this Asian woman changed her\nclothing for whatever reason.\nAnd they all got\nback on the bus.\nI think the relevance of\nit being an Asian woman\nis that there were\nlanguage barriers that\nexplain what later happened.\nSo everyone gets\nback on the bus,\nthe Asian woman has\nchanged her clothing.\nAnd the bus is about to leave\nbut then someone notices, hey,\nthere was an Asian woman who\ngot off the bus who isn't--\nit hasn't come back yet.\nAnd they tell the driver this.\nAnd this poses a problem.\nSo now everyone's waiting\nfor this person to return.\nBut in fact, everyone\nwas on the bus.\nThis woman had just\nchanged her clothing,\nand was not recognized\nby her fellow travelers.\nSo everyone gets concerned as\nthis tourist doesn't show up.\nAnd they start looking for her.\nAnd they can't find her.\nAnd so a search party is formed.\nAnd the Asian woman, because\nof whatever language barrier,\nheard that there was\na missing tourist,\nso she joins the\nsearch party, which,\nin fact, is looking for her.\nAnd this goes on into the night.\nAnd they're readying\nhelicopters for a dawn patrol\nto find the missing tourist.\nNow, at some point\nalong the way,\nI think it was at like\n3:00 in the morning,\nthis tourist realizes that she\nis the object of this search.\nAnd obviously, the\nwhole thing unravels.\nShe confesses that she changed\nher clothes and the problem\nis solved.\nBut the problem is not\nsolved by the logic\nthat the seeker is expected.\nSo it's like, it's\nnot true to say\nthat the missing\ntourist was found\nin the way that was expected.\nBecause a missing\ntourist was never lost.\nThe missing tourist was\npart of the search party.\nSo when you think about\nit from her point of view,\nlike what happened, she's\npart of the search party.\nShe's looking for the\nmissing tourist not knowing\nthat she, in fact, is\nthe missing tourist.\nSo what happens at the moment\nshe realizes that everyone's\nlooking for her?\nThe search isn't\nconsummated in the way\nthat is implied by the logic\nof everyone's use of attention.\nAnd yet the problem evaporates.\nAnd there's something\ndeeply analogous\nabout the structure of that\nand the meditative journey.\nPrecisely in, again, not talking\nabout all the possible changes\nin the contents of consciousness\nthat could be good,\nwhich, again, they\ncome along for the ride\nanyway when you do the\nthing I'm talking about.\nIt's on this point of\nlooking for the self\nand not finding it.\nAnd there is this sense\nthat, OK, the self is here,\nand it's a problem.\nIt is the string upon which\nall of my conscious states,\nmostly unhappy ones, are strong.\nIt's the thing that is at\nthe center of my anxiety.\nIt's the thing that I\ndon't feel good about.\nIt's the thing that when\ncriticized, I let implode.\nIt's the center of my\nproblem, and now I'm\ntrying to feel better.\nAnd meditation has\nbeen handed to me\nas a possible remedy\nfor my situation.\nAnd it's billed as a remedy.\nAnd in fact, I'm\nhearing from this guy\nthat this is the thing that is\ngoing to cause me to realize\nthat my self isn't where--\nor as I thought it was.\nSo now I'm going to look.\nAnd so again, the\nsense is, I start out\nfar away from the goal here.\nI start out with a problem.\nI'm now meditating on the\nevidence of my enlightenment.\nI can feel my problem.\nI feel that I'm distracted\nand distractible.\nAnd I feel as this sort\nof cramp at the center\nof my life, that's me.\nAnd I'm not as happy as\nI want to be, I'm not\nas confident as I want to be.\nI'm more distractible\nthan I want to be.\nAnd now, I'm paying\nattention to the breath.\nThis is what the search\nparty feels like.\nThis is what the\nconfused tourist feels\nlike in her own search party.\nAnd she's looking for\nthe missing person.\nSo the angle of--\nthe inclination of\nall of this is--\nand the logic of it is all\nwrong, understandably so,\ngiven how we all get\ninto this situation.\nBut it's useful\nto continually try\nto undercut it and recognize\nthat the thing that's\nbeing looked for is actually\nright on the surface, which\nis, there is no one looking.\nThere is no place\nfrom which you are--\nif you're paying attention\nto the breath or to sounds\nor noticing the\nnext thought arise,\nthis sense that you\nare over here doing\nthat thing is actually what\nit's like to be thinking\nand not knowing that\nyou're thinking.\nThere's an\nundercurrent of thought\nthat's going uninspected\nin that moment.\nAnd so there is just--\nthere's a continually\nlooking for the mind,\nlooking for the\ncenter of experience,\nlooking for the one who is\nlooking, which, again, which\nis the orienting practice here.\nAnd there's a lot more I\nsay about this, obviously,\nover waking up.\nBut it's the experiment you\nhave to perform in order\nto get ready to recognize that\nthe search party was formed\nin error, essentially.\nAnd the problem\nthat you're trying\nto solve with this\npractice does evaporate\nin a similar way, which is\nlike, you don't actually\nget there in the way\nthat you're hoping for.\nIt's like you drop out\nthe bottom of this thing\nin an unexpected way.\nThere's actually another\nsimilar parable or anecdote\nthat I don't remember\nif it's Zen or Sufi or--\nI mean, I'm sure it's\nbeen re-appropriated\nin many different ways or by\nmany different traditions.\nBut the case of somebody who's\nlost in a town and they're\nasking for directions and you\ncan put this in Manhattan.\nLet's say, you're wandering\nManhattan and you're a tourist,\nyou don't know\nwhere anything is.\nAnd you stop and ask someone,\nwhere is Central Park?\nAnd the person thinks for a\nsecond and they says, oh, yeah.\nUnfortunately, you can't get\nto Central Park from here.\nNow, that is a very strange--\nI mean, you think about\nthat for a second.\nYou realize, OK,\nthat's an absurd.\nThere is no place that you can't\nget to from the place you're\nstarting on Earth.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\nfailure to describe\nthe physical relationships\nbetween anything in the world.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nThat's just not the\nworld we live in.\nSo but it's a funny thing.\nBut on some level that\nis true of meditation.\nIt's like you can't\nget there from here.\nThe sense of view as\nsubject isn't brought along\nto this thing\nyou're looking for.\nIt's almost like\nyou're making a fist\nand you're trying to\nget to an open hand.\nThe fist doesn't get to\ntake that journey as a fist.\nThe fist doesn't go\nalong for the ride.\nThe fist comes apart.\nAnd on some level,\nthe subjectivity\nis an attentional fist.\nIt is a contraction of energy.\nAgain, it's so much bound up\nand thought for most of us,\nmost of the time.\nAnd when properly\ninspected, there's\njust this evaporation\nof the starting point.\nBut there's not this fulfillment\nof, I'm going to get--\nthis fixed is just going to--\nif life gets good enough, if\nI get concentrated enough,\nfocused enough, if\nI austere enough,\nif I renounce enough,\nif I desire less, if I--\nwith enough good\nintentions, this fist\nis going to move into some\nsort of sublime condition.\nThat's not the logic\nof the process.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I really\nappreciate these models\nand analogies for\nconscious experience\nboth as most people experience\nthem and harbor them\nand as a way to frame\nwhat's possible through\na proper meditation practice.\nI do want to talk about\nwhat a proper meditation\npractice looks like a bit.\nBut at some point, I do want to\nraise a model of, maybe, even\njust perceptual awareness to\nsee if it survives the filters\nthat you've provided.\nBut first, briefly, and\nthen we can return to it.\nWhat does this meditation\npractice or set of practices\nlook like?\nObviously, the app\nis a wonderful tool.\nI've started using it.\nAs I mentioned at the\nbeginning, my father's\nbeen using it for a\nwhile and many people\nhave derived great\nbenefit from it.\nBut if we were to break\nit down, meditation\ninto some basic component\nparts as we have broken down\nnormal perceptual experience in\nsome of its component parts--\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --I can\njust throw out some things\nthat I associate\nwith meditation,\nand maybe you can elaborate\non how these may or may not\nbe applied.\nFor instance, there\nis almost always\na ceasing of robust\nmotor movement.\nI know they're walking\nmeditations and so forth.\nBut it seems like sitting or\nlying down and, perhaps, not\nalways but often limiting\nour visual perception,\nclosing the eyes.\nSAM HARRIS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Directing\na mind's eye someplace.\nIs there a dedicated effort\ntoward generating imagery?\nWhat are the component parts?\nAnd where I'm really going\nwith this is, why would those\ncomponent parts, eventually,\nallow for this dissolution\nof the fist or the\nrealization that there\nis no distinction between\nactor and observer and so on.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah.\nWell, so to answer the second\nquestion first, ultimately,\nmeditation is not a\npractice that you're\nadding to your life.\nIt's not a doing\nmore of anything.\nIt's actually ceasing\nto do something.\nIt's ultimately non-distraction.\nI mean, ultimately, you're\nrecognizing what consciousness\nis like when you're\nno longer distracted\nby the automatic\narising of thought.\nIt's not the\nthoughts don't arise,\nit's not that you\ncan't use them,\nit's not that you become\nirrational or unintelligent,\nI mean, all of that-- you\nstill have all of your tools,\nbut everything is in plain view.\nI mean, there's an analogy in\nTibetan Buddhism which I love,\nwhich is you're kind of in\nthe final stage of meditation,\nthoughts are like thieves\nentering an empty house.\nThere's nothing\nfor them to steal.\nSo in the usual case,\nthoughts are-- there really\nis something in jeopardy.\nEvery time a thought comes,\nI'm not meditating anymore,\nand not only that,\nI feel terrible\nbecause of what I'm thinking\nabout most of the time.\nAnd so it's totally\nunderstandable\nthat thoughts seem like a\nproblem in the beginning.\nAnd for certain\ntypes of meditation,\nthey are explicitly\nthought of as a problem\nbecause you're trying\nto focus on one thing\nto the exclusion of everything\nelse, including thought.\nAnd that is what I called the\nconcentration practice earlier.\nAnd that's a training\nthat can be good to do.\nIt becomes a tool that you can\nuse for other kinds of insight.\nBut it's a very specific\nand it's kind of brittle\nskill in the end.\nI mean, it's a skill.\nJust like I'm going to\npay attention to one thing\nand I'm going to do that so\nwell that everything else is\ngoing to fade out.\nAnd it's somewhat\nanalogous to what you\ndescribed in the visual system.\nIf have a laser focus\nto one fixation point,\neverything else in your visual\nfield begins to fade out.\nBut meditatively, if you have\na laser focus on any one thing,\nwhether it's the breath or a\ncandle flame or whatever it is,\nnot only does--\nI mean, let's use the\nbreath for a second.\nBecause your eyes can be closed.\nI mean, you can lose\nall sense of everything.\nI mean, you can lose\nall sense of hearing\nand your physical\nbody can disappear.\nI mean, like, literally, it\ncan become incredibly subtle\nand vast and drug-like.\nAnd many people\napproach meditation\nthinking climbing the\nladder of those changes\ninto subtlety and vastness,\nthat's the whole game.\nAnd it can be a deeply\nrewarding game to play.\nAnd it also does come with all\nkinds of ancillary benefits.\nI mean, all the\nfocus and the calm\nand the smoothness\nof emotional states.\nI mean, all of that comes\nwith greater concentration.\nAnd it can be quite wonderful.\nBut again, at best, that's a\ntool to aim in the direction\nthat I'm talking about now\nwith respect to meditation,\nwhich relates to more what\nI would call mindfulness\ngenerically.\nAnd ultimately,\nnon-dual mindfulness.\nSo mindfulness\ngenerically and for most\npeople, certainly\nin the beginning,\ndualistically is\njust the practice\nof paying careful attention to\nwhatever is arising on its own.\nNow in the beginning, it's\nnatural to take a single object\nlike the breath as\na starting point.\nIt's an anchor.\nBut very, very quickly, over the\ncourse of even your first week\nof doing this, teachers and\nvarious sources of information\nwill recommend that once you get\nsome facilities-- once you know\nthe difference between\nbeing lost in thought\nand actually paying attention\nto the breath, well,\nthen you can open\nit up to everything.\nYou can open up the sounds\nand other sensations\nin the body and\nmoods and emotions.\nAnd even, ultimately,\nthoughts themselves.\nSo very quickly,\nyou can recognize\nthat thoughts are\nnot intrinsically\nthe enemy to this practice.\nThey are also just spontaneous\nappearances in consciousness\nthat can be observed.\nBut for some considerable\nperiod of time,\npeople will feel that\nthere is a place from which\nthat observation is happening.\nThere's just, I'm now the\none who's being mindful.\nAnd however attenuated that\nsense of self can be, I mean,\nagain, it can get\nvery expansive.\nI mean, you can lose--\nas you get anything, just\na modicum of concentration,\nyou know it becomes\nvery drug-like\nand you get the boundaries\nof your body dissolve.\nAnd your feeling of having\na body can disappear.\nAnd you if your eyes are closed,\nyou know your visual field--\nI mean, most people, when they\nclose their eyes initially,\nthey just forget about\ntheir visual field.\nBut if you close\nyour eyes right now,\nyou notice your visual\nfield is fully present.\nAnd we call it dark,\nbut it's not quite dark.\nThere is a sort of scintillating\nsome field of color and shadow\nthat's there in the darkness\nof your closed eyes.\nAnd that can become\na sky-like domain\nof vast visual\nexpression that opens up\nas you get more concentrated\nwith your eyes closed right.\nSo you can very much be aware\nof seeing with your eyes closed\nin a meditative practice.\nBut from the point of\nview of mindfulness,\nthe logic is not to care about\nany of the interesting changes\nand experience that come\nas a result of practicing\nin this way, because\nthe underlying goal\nis to be more and more\nequanimous with changes.\nSo it's not to grasp at\nwhat's pleasant or interesting\nand not to push what's\nunpleasant or boring\nor otherwise not\nengaging in a way.\nWhat you want is just a kind\nof a sky-like mind that just\nallows everything to appear.\nAnd you're not\nclinging to anything\nor reacting to anything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask\nyou what your thoughts are\nabout the differences between\nnouns, adjectives, and verbs\nin the context of what\nwe're talking about\nin you're describing?\nAnd the reason I bring this\nup is that as you know,\nI know everything in\nbiology is a process.\nWe would never ever\nsay, oh, the perception\nof that red line on\na painting is a noun.\nI mean, it's an event\nin the visual system.\nYou're abstracting\nsome understanding\nabout that thing in\nthe outside world.\nAnd I think it's very useful\nin thinking about the brain.\nPeople will notice I notice--\nI, excuse me, actively avoid\nthe use of the word mind,\nbecause I figure, especially,\nwith sitting across from me,\nthat I'll step in it if I do.\nBut the brain generates\na series of perceptions\nor what have you by through\nprocesses, not nouns.\nAnd so when thinking about\nbiology, I think of development\nis an arc of processes.\nAging is an arc-- perception\nis an arc of processes.\nThey just exist on\ndifferent time scales.\nAnd so a little bit\nof what I'm hearing\nis that inside of an\neffective meditation practice,\nthere's a little bit of\ncertainly non-judgment\nbut discarding of the\nnoun and the adjective\nmodes of language.\nLike red apple.\nOK.\nIt's a red apple,\nbut then you need\nto eliminate some other\nadjectives about it.\nIt's a rotten apple,\nit's a ripe apple.\nAnd instead view the\nappearance and disappearance\nof that apple as just a thing, a\nprocess as opposed to an event.\nAnd now, events,\nwe could really get\ninto the language aspect of it.\nThat just reveals how\ndiminished language\nis to describe the workings\nof the brain at some level.\nI don't know if any\nof these resonates.\nBut it seems to me, the\ngoal or one of the goals\nis to start to understand\nthe algorithm that\nis the fleeting nature of\nperception but to not focus\non any one single perception.\nAnd then to not even focused\non one single algorithm,\nbut to, at some\nlevel, there's a--\nwhat is revealed to\nthe meditator over time\nis some sort of\nmacroscopic principle\nabout the way perceptions\nwork at a deeper level.\nThat there's a deeper principle\nthere that sits below our--\ncertainly our normal\neveryday awareness.\nBut that in paying attention to\nthe mechanics of all this stuff\nand not judging those mechanics,\nnot naming those mechanics,\nor just naming them\nand let them pass by.\nThat there's some\naction function,\nsome verb is revealed.\nAnd that maybe that\nverb-- may be the word\nto describe that\nverb is mindfulness.\nMaybe mindfulness is really\njust a verb to describe that.\nI don't know.\nIs there anything here?\nOr am I-- I don't know\nif I'm creating just\nlike useless straw or\nif there's actually\na seed here of something real.\nBut to me, any time I want\nto understand something\nin biology or psychology, I\ntry and broaden the time domain\nand think in terms of verbs,\nnot nouns or adjectives.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nYeah, yeah.\nNo.\nThat's very useful,\nand that's somewhat\nadjacent to this\ndistinction I'm making\nbetween dualistic and\nnon-dualistic ways\nof experiencing the world.\nSo even dualistically,\neverything is still a process.\nAnd we're misled\nby the reification\nthat noun talk gives us.\nAnd this applies not just to\nsomething like mindfulness,\nbut even to something\nlike the self.\nSo the sense of self\nis also a process.\nI mean, it's a verb,\nit's not-- so we're self\nin more than we are ourselves.\nAnd there are-- even appropriate\nuses of the term self\nthat don't go away\neven when you recognize\nthat the core subject,\nself, is an illusion.\nThere are states of self where\nyou can recognize in your life\nthat you inhabit very different\nmodes of being depending\non the context.\nSo like there are\nmoments where you--\njust by walking into\na certain building,\nyou suddenly transition into\na different state of self.\nLike suddenly, you\npass through a door\nand now you are a customer\nin a store, right?\nSo we know what that\ncustomer feeling is.\nLike, you're now the person\nwho's getting the attention.\nIt's a very formalized\ntype of attention\nfrom the person who is running\nthe store or a restaurant.\nYou're a customer\nat a restaurant.\nThat's a-- I just remembered\nsomething that's funny.\nThat was born of a\nmismatch of this.\nI'll come back to\nthat in a second.\nSo there are-- so\nwe go through it.\nYou can be a student in\nthe presence of a teacher,\nyou're going to be a\nparent in the presence\nof a son or a daughter,\nyou can be a spouse\nin the presence of your spouse.\nAnd all of those shadings of--\nlike the change in context\nreally does usher in some\nfundamental\npsychological changes\nin just the states\nof consciousness\nthat are available to you.\nAnd some of this is really--\nI mean, I'm sure we could\nunderstand a lot about this\npersonally and generically.\nBut it is pretty mysterious.\nI mean, there are\npeople who I know\nwho I'm with them\nin a certain way,\nand based on something\nI'm getting off of them,\nI can't be that--\nI'm effortlessly\none way with them,\nand there's no way I could be\nthat way with somebody else.\nI don't know if it's the\npheromones or their facial,\njust the way they are,\ntheir facial expression.\nBut I mean, there are\npeople with whom I'm really\nkind of effortlessly\nfunny, and there\nare people with whom\nI couldn't even--\nit would never occur to me to be\nfunny no matter what happened.\nAnd I have long\nstanding relationships\nwith these people, so all\nof that's very mysterious.\nBut anyway, the\ndifference there is not\nin this core sense of\nsubject in relationship\nto all the objects, it's in\nkind of the states of self.\nAnd all of that is very verby.\nAll this is a\npattern of changes.\nIt's a pattern of\nwhat's available\nand what's not available,\nthe capacities there that\ncome online or not in\nthose various contexts.\nBut no, the memory\nI just had, which\nI hadn't had in a long time.\nBut it was one of\nthese moments where\nI realized the power of\nthese shifts in context\nfor states of self.\nSo once, I was a young man.\nI think I was probably\n22 or so, and single.\nAnd like, you're just\nlike, trying to figure out\nhow do you meet women?\nAnd how does one get\nconfident to do this well?\nAnd I walked into a restaurant\nand a kind of a woman\nwas walking toward me, toward\nthe front door of the restroom.\nBut she was walking toward me\nin a way where I just by default\nassumed she was the\nhostess in the restaurant.\nBut she wasn't the\nhostess, she was just\nsomeone who had just\neaten there, I guess.\nSo I walked through,\nand she comes out.\nAnd so there's a fundamental\nmisunderstanding in me\nthat's set up by literally just\nthis change in architecture.\nAnd so I just said\nhi to her in a way\nthat I presumably I would\nsay hi to any hostess who\nwas coming up to ask me\nwhere I wanted to sit.\nBut what had\nactually happened is\nI had said hi to a\ntotal stranger in a way\nthat I tended at\nthat point never\nto say hi to total\nstrangers because I was shy\nand it was just like that.\nBut apparently, I gave her\nlike a 10,000 watt high\nof all of the confidence\nyou would have if you\nwere that sort of person.\nAnd it just ushered\nin a complete like--\nso I went to my\ntable, and this woman,\nI came back into the restaurant\nand gave me her phone number,\nwhich was something that\nwas just a completely\nforeign experience to me,\nand it was based completely\non my misunderstanding of\nthe situation I was in.\nAnd so anyway--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Among\nthe misunderstandings\nthat one can have and then\naction and engage in life,\nI would say that was a\nsomewhat adaptive one.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, but\nthen you realize that, OK,\nbut then there\nare certain people\nwho recognize this\nmachinery to whatever degree\nor have kind of natural\naptitudes for bringing\ncertain things online or not\nsuch that they can consciously\nmake these states of self,\nthis level of gregariousness,\nsay, available to them\nin the circumstances\nwhere it's is actually\nuseful to them.\nSo if you're single and\nyou want to meet people,\nwell, it's actually very\nhelpful to feel confident enough\nto just go say hi to strangers\nand ask them how they're doing\nand to be online in that way.\nWhere at that point in my\nlife, in that circumstance,\nby default, I was\ngoing to ignore\nthis stranger who I was\npassing by in the doorway\nof a restaurant.\nBut thinking she\nwas the hostess,\nI was engaging her fully.\nSo anyway, you can\nconsciously-- again,\nthis does not invoke\nfree will at all.\nBut yes, you can\nconsciously decide\nto play with these\nmechanisms such\nthat you can decide\nwhat states of self\nwould be more normative to have\ngiven what you want in life.\nAnd you can become increasingly\nattentive to the ways in which\nyou get played by the world.\nYou're a kind of instrument.\nYour mind is a\nkind of instrument.\nYour brain is a kind of\ninstrument that is continually\ngetting played by the\nsituations you are in,\nand you can become more\nof an intelligent curator\nof your conscious states and\nyour conscious capacities\njust by noticing\nthe changes in you.\nLike, in graduate school,\nit's something I talk about.\nI think at some\npoint in waking up,\nthis became very stark for me\nbecause I was an old graduate\nstudent.\nI had taken 11 years off at\nStanford between my sophomore\nand junior year.\nSo when I went back to school--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Talk\nabout a leave of absence.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, but I\nmean, Stanford had this,\nyou might know this.\nThey have this stop out policy\nwhere you never really drop\nout, you just stop as you want.\nYou can always go back.\nYou don't have to\nwrite letters saying\nthat you still exist\nevery two years as you\ndo in other schools.\nSo anyway, I showed\nup after 11 years.\nSo I was really on a deadline,\nand I felt late for everything.\nSo I'm kind of\nfinishing my degree\nas quickly as I can\nas an undergraduate,\nand then I jump into\ngraduate school,\nand I'm an old graduate student.\nThere's a real sense of urgency.\nLike, I'm late.\nI should have done this earlier.\nI want to get this stuff done.\nBut then 9/11 happened.\nAnd just as I had finished\nmy coursework getting my PhD,\nand I was just getting\ninto my research but 9/11\nintersected with my\nlife in such a way\nthat I just had to drop\neverything and write\nmy first book.\nAnd I did that.\nAnd then I just had to\ndrop everything and write\nmy second book because of the\nresponse to the first book.\nAnd so essentially, I\nhad like, four years,\nwhere I was AWOL doing my PhD.\nBut I still had a toe in\nthe lab and I was still\nshowing up occasionally.\nBut I was becoming this\nkind of cautionary tale\nfrom the point of\nview of grad school,\nbut I was also becoming kind of\na famous or semi-famous writer\nbecause my first book had been\na New York Times best seller,\nso I was getting some\nnotoriety as a writer.\nAnd so I was doing things\nlike, I was giving a Ted Talk\nbut I still hadn't\nfinished graduate school.\nSo it was I think that\ntiming's is right, maybe\nI had just finished\ngraduate school when\nI gave the Ted Talk.\nBut anyway, so I was\nrowing in two boats\nand one boat was\nsinking or showing\nevery sign of being damaged.\nAnd I was literally\nlike, getting letters\nfrom the head of the\ndepartment saying,\nwe're concerned about you.\nBut on the other hand, I was\nbecoming a quasi celebrity\nin that world too, at least in\na world that was overlapping.\nSo I was having the experience\nof going in the moment where\nthis crystallized for me\nin a fairly peculiar way\nwas, I had a meeting\nat like 3:00 o'clock\nwith my advisor who\nwas just this guy,\nMark Cohen, in the brain\nmapping center at UCLA who's\na fantastic guy.\nGreat advisor.\nI did not extract as much wisdom\nfrom him as I should have.\nBrilliant scientist.\nAnd for him, I'm late.\nAt least, in my head--\nhe is not that he was riding\nme so hard but in my head,\nI'm very self\nconscious about how\nI'm not living up to his\nexpectations at this point.\nSo I have a meeting with\nhim at 3:00 o'clock,\nand I'm just kind of\nwilting under his gaze\nand my own imagined\ninner gaze of his.\nBut two hours later,\nI have a meeting\nwith his boss, a dinner\nmeeting with his boss\nwho wants to meet with me to get\nadvice on launching his book.\nWe have the same\npublisher but I'm\nlike, the much bigger\nauthor at Norton,\nand he's coming\nto me for advice.\nAnd so I'm ricocheting between\ntwo diametrically opposite self\nstates that are-- again, this\ncomes down to architecture.\nIt's literally like\nthe state I was\nin walking into one building\nand then leaving and walking\ninto another building\non the same campus.\nAnd they were completely\nopposite self concepts.\nLike, in one context,\nI am a fuckup.\nIn another context,\nI'm a celebrity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And you\nhave mastery and virtuosity,\nand we're developing\nit very quickly.\nSAM HARRIS: But so\nagain, this is a kind\nof a stark version of that.\nBut everyone has\nsome version of this\njust in bouncing between\ntalking to their mom\nand then talking to\ntheir best friend\nand then talking to a stranger\nand talking to someone who's\nvery successful,\ntalking to someone\nwho's not very successful.\nYou notice your vulnerability\nto all of this stuff.\nAnd ultimately, what\nyou want is a level\nof psychological integrity that\nis truly divorceable from that.\nNow, I'm not I'm not\nsaying you're ever\ngoing to get it perfect, there's\nalways going to be some--\nI mean, I can't talk about\nthe ultimate fulfillment\nof this process.\nI'm not a Buddha, I'm not saying\nI've finished the project.\nBut I think there's more and\nmore as you become sensitive\nto these changes and you become\nsensitive to what it's like\nto actually not be\npsychologically reactive\nand not be definable by your\nown self-concept, your own--\nyou're not identifying\nwith anything,\nyou're not hanging\nyour hat on anything,\nyou're not thinking about\nyourself in the kind of terms\nthat you would export\nto others and then\ncare about what they\nthink about you.\nThere's a kind of\ninvulnerability\nthat arises that's not borne\nof being well defended,\nit's born of being evaporated.\nIt's like, you're no longer\nkeeping score in those ways.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Once\nagain, I really appreciate\nthat description\nbecause these days,\nI'm really intrigued\nby something\nwe've known for a long\ntime that you're certainly\nfamiliar with is the prefrontal\ncortex's ability to establish\ncontext dependent rule sets.\nA Stroop task would\nbe basic example\nof reading numbers\nor letters on cards\nand then switching\nto having to report\nthe colors that the letters\nand numbers are written in.\nIt's a basic task.\nBut prefrontal cortex,\nobviously important for setting\ncontext dependent thought and\nbehavior and directed action.\nBut within the context of all\nthese different variations\nof the self, depending on\ngraduate school or relationship\nwhere sitting alone\nin one's room,\nthere are different\nrule sets arise\nand somehow, we are able to have\na coherent sense of self that\nencompasses all of those.\nFunctional people can toggle\nbetween them as needed and not\noverlap them inappropriately.\nAt least not to the\nextent that it's\ncareer failing or life failing.\nAlthough there are sad\nexamples of that, many of which\nexist in the Twitter space.\nI know several colleagues,\nnot directly of mine,\nbut people who threw mistakes\nmade with their thumbs,\nwhere they forgot\ncontext or forgot\nto realize that the context on\nsocial media is near infinite.\nBut the context that\nexisted in their head\nmight not be clear in the\nway that they communicated\nsomething, and they\nlost their jobs\nby saying what were perceived\nas insensitive things.\nIn some cases were, in fact,\noffensive, insensitive things.\nIn some cases, it's debatable.\nIn any case, I think that the\nimage that now comes to mind\nrelates to something you've said\nseveral times, that it's not\nabout eliminating\nsomething, it's\nabout revealing that something\nwas never actually there.\nAnd then in terms of\nsensory experience\nand these different\naspects of the self,\nI have this image\nin my mind of--\nI'm not an experienced\nscuba diver,\nbut I've done enough of it.\nI've worn a wetsuit.\nYou wear a complete\nwetsuit with the hood.\nAnd this idea if you were\nborn into that wetsuit,\nyou might think that yeah,\nyou nudge up or lean up\nagainst a wall and you\nexperience it one way.\nBut were you to\nshed that wetsuit,\nyou go, wow, there's\nthis incredible landscape\nof somatosensory experience\nthat I had no idea.\nIt goes way beyond\nlevels of sensitivity.\nRight now you're talking about\nfine two point discrimination\nand light strokes,\nand this could\nbe positive or negative\npain in other ways too.\nBut what you're\ndescribing is essentially\nthat the wetsuit was\nnever really there,\nbut was created through\na series of action steps.\nAnd I think what we're\nmigrating towards here\nis a set of for most,\nnon-intuitive or non-reflexive\naction steps that reveal\nto us that in fact, we're\nnot wearing the wetsuit.\nNow, you raised one\ntopic, which I think\nis analogous to\nthis wetsuit, which\nis this notion of distraction.\nThat normally, distraction is\nmasking what would otherwise\nbe a better experience of life.\nI can think of\ndistraction as falling\ninto two different bins.\nOne would be the\nkind of distraction\nthat is internally generated.\nLike, the fact that\nthoughts arise and pull me\ndown different alleyways\nand avenues of my brain\nand my thoughts\nand my experience.\nAnd that would compete\nwith my ability\nto really focus on something.\nAnd then another\nform of distraction\nwhich captures my ability\nto focus intensely\nbut has me focusing\non the wrong things.\nAnd here, I think\nthe judgment of wrong\nis reasonable to include\nif, for instance, I'm\nbeing impulsively yanked to\nsomething on social media.\nI'm being impulsively yanked\nto someone else's pain\nand experience and\nsomehow confusing\nthat with my own experience.\nThis isn't empathy but\njust being yanked around.\nMy attention as a spotlight\nis kind of like over\nhere, over there.\nI'm not feeling\nas if I'm the one\nstanding behind that\nspotlight controlling it\nor I'm not the spotlight,\njust to keep with what\nwe've been building up here.\nSo could you tell us a\nlittle bit about distraction\nand tell me whether\nor not these two\nforms are in any way\naccurate or inaccurate?\nI'd be happy for them\nto be inaccurate.\nAnd whether or not there are\nother forms of distraction\nthat we need to be\non the lookout for.\nAnd again, I think\nwhat most people\nare seeking is, what is the way\nto not just enhance our ability\nto focus but to shed this\nwetsuit-like cloak that limits\nour experience that I'm\ncalling and that you've\ncalled distraction?\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, distraction\nis one component of it.\nThe other aspect of it is\nidentification with thought.\nAnd the feeling of self\nis bound up in the sense\nthat I'm the thinker,\nI'm the one attending,\nI'm the one vulnerable.\nI'm the inner homunculus that's\nvulnerable to experience.\nAnd it can be\ngratified by it or not,\nand it's constantly trying\nto improve it or mitigate\nnegative aspects of it.\nIt's the sense that\nthere's kind of a rider\non the horse of\nconsciousness as opposed\nto just consciousness\nand its contents.\nSo again, it rides atop this\nillusion of control, et cetera.\nSo to go all the way back to the\nquestion you asked about, just\nwhat is in it, what I\nrecommend as a starting point\nfor meditation.\nSome of your assumptions\nare, in fact, true.\nYes, I often recommend\nat the beginning people\nclose their eyes and you\ndo a sitting practice\nand it's different from\na walk in practice.\nI mean, you can do\nboth, but people\ntend to start sitting\nwith their eyes closed.\nBut again, ultimately\nwhere this is going\nis it's not an art\nof-- meditation\nproperly recognized is not\nan artifice that you're\nadding to your life.\nIt's not even a practice,\nit is less rather than more.\nAnd therefore, it is also\ncoincident with potentially\nevery waking moment.\nThere's nothing that you\ncan do with your attention\nonce you know how to meditate.\nThat in principle\nexcludes meditation\nbecause meditation\nis just a recognition\nof an intrinsic character of\nconsciousness in each moment.\nAnd all you have\nin each moment is\nconsciousness and its contents,\nwhatever you're doing.\nSo in the beginning, you'll be\nvery deliberate and precious\nabout deciding to\npractice meditation,\nand you'll set aside 10\nminutes in the morning,\nand you'll do that.\nAnd it'll seem very different\nfrom the next 10 minutes\nwhen you're spilling\nout onto your to-do list\nand you're trying to figure\nout what the day looks like.\nBut ultimately,\nyou want to erase\nthis boundary between formal\npractice and the rest of life\nsuch that it's just\nnot remotely findable.\nAnd that's achievable.\nAnd I think even from\nthe very beginning,\nyou can relax this conceptual\ndistinction between meditation\nand its antithesis, because it's\nnot at the level of anything\nyou're doing, it's at\nthe level of what's\nhappening in your\nrelationship to thought.\nLike, what can you notice?\nIt's + transition from\nthe by-stable percept.\nYou're looking at the\nimage and you see nothing.\nLet's say it's the\nDalmatian, it's\njust the spots on the paper.\nAnd you don't see anything.\nAnd then all of a sudden the\nDalmatian or the face of Jesus\nor whatever the image is\npops out and then you see it,\nit's the transition from\nnothing to something.\nThe practice becomes\nthe transition\nfrom being lost in thought\nand then waking up.\nAnd breaking the\nspell of thought,\nand identification of thought\nis very much like waking up\nfrom a dream and having--\nit's like that transition.\nLike you're having a\ndream and couple of things\nare true there.\nI mean, it's a psychosis\nthat is just not--\nwe don't problematize\nbecause you're safely in bed\nand you're not moving\nor unless you've got\nsome kind of sleep disorder.\nYou're not walking\naround harming\nyourself or anybody else.\nBut to be in bed\nand to not know it\nand to think you're\nrunning along a beach\nor you're getting tried for\nmurder in a court of law\nor whatever the\nthing is that you're\ncompletely delusional\nabout, that is psychosis.\nAnd it's like\nyou're fundamentally\nunaware of your circumstance.\nAnd then two things\ncan happen there.\nYou can either become lucid\nwithin the dream, which\nis interesting, and there's\na whole phenomenology\nof that which can be practiced.\nBut more commonly,\nyou can just wake up\nfrom the dream and\nall of a sudden,\nthe problem you thought\nyou had is no longer there,\nand you have a completely\ndifferent context\nfor your conscious life.\nNow, you know you're safely\nin bed all the while.\nThere really is\nsomething analogous\nwhen you break this\nidentification with thought.\nYou're having a\nthought that seems\nto be some kind of moral or\npsychological emergency and yet\nthe moment you see\ndaylight around,\nthe moment you see\nthat the mind is larger\nthan this mere appearance,\nthen suddenly you\nhave a degree of freedom\nthat a moment ago was\njust unthinkable.\nAnd you recognize, you\nsort of come to in a way,\nyou recognize your\ncircumstance in a way\nthat you weren't a moment ago\nwhen you were just talking\nto yourself, when you were just\nidentical to that conversation.\nSo this is all to say that\nultimately, meditation--\nI mean, so again, there's\nanother apparent paradox here.\nMany people who don't\nknow much about meditation\nwill say things\nlike, well, for me,\nrunning is my meditation\nor skiing or rock climbing\nor playing the guitar\nor something they like\nto do that gives them an\nexperience of flow, that's\nwhat they go to feel better\nand that's the opposite of all\nthe chaos of their lives\nor their time on Twitter\nor whatever it is.\nAnd virtually every\ncase, it's not\ntrue to say that that is\neffectively meditation.\nBy learning to play\nthe guitar, you're\nnot going to learn what\nI'm calling meditation.\nAnd you're not going\nto learn it by cycling\nand getting-- no matter how good\nyou get at any of those things,\nyou're not going to learn\nit by doing those things.\nBut paradoxically, I\nmean, not really, but it\ncan seem like a paradox.\nOnce you know how to\nmeditate, then you\ncan meditate doing\nall of those things.\nMeditation is totally compatible\nwith playing the guitar\nor skiing or doing any\nordinary thing you like to do.\nSo once you know\nhow to meditate,\nand again, it's totally\nnatural in the beginning\nto formalize it and to set\naside time each day to do it\nbecause it is a training.\nI mean, it is something\nthat in the beginning,\nyou have to get used to.\nBut once you're\ngetting used to it,\nthen there is no good reason\nnot to be experiencing\nthis thing I'm\ncalling meditation,\nthis insight into the center\nlooseness of consciousness,\nthe non-selfhood\nof consciousness.\nYou should experience\nit when you're\nplaying your favorite\nsport or when you're having\na conversation with somebody.\nThen to come back to\nyour initial assumption\nabout eyes closed,\na lot of practice,\neven formal practice\ncan be done eyes open.\nAnd it's important\nto do it as open\nbecause so much of our\nanchoring of our sense of self\nis based on visual cues.\nI mean, we know that you\ncan if you give people\nthe right visual cues,\nyou can translocate\ntheir sense of self.\nYou can give them an\nout-of-body experience\nwith a video display,\nwhere you can literally\nmake them feel like there's\na body swapping illusion.\nYou can make them feel that\nthey're in another person's\nbody looking back\nat their body if you\nrun the cameras the right way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I've done this\nin VR, seeing an image of--\nthey create an avatar\nfor you and then\nyour bodily movements generate\nthe movements of the avatar,\nand you start gaining presence\nas they call it in the VR lingo\nvery quickly.\nAnd then pretty\nsoon, you lose sense\nof your own bodily\nrepresentation.\nAnd it's a little eerie.\nWhat's eerie is to me\nis going back into,\nof course never left, but back\ninto your actual body when\nthe VR goggles pop off.\nThe world seems\nalmost overwhelming\nthe number of\nsensory stimuli that\nare in a laboratory room,\nwhich is actually quite sparse.\nSo exactly what\nyou described, this\ntranslocation of notions of\nself through visual experience.\nSAM HARRIS: But\nconversely, when you\nlose the sense of\nself, the sense of self\nI'm talking about,\nit can be especially\nvivid and salient\nwith eyes open.\nBecause so many of your\nreference points to selfhood\nare delivered\nvisually, especially\nin a social situation.\nSo like, I'm talking to you,\nyou're looking back at me.\nSo the implication\nof your gaze is\nthat I'm over here behind my\nface implicated by your gaze.\nSo the sense that you're\nlooking at something\nis the sense of self\nin that social context.\nAnd if your facial expression\nchanges, I'm saying something\nand if you kind of\nfurrow your brow, like,\nwhat the hell is he-- and I can\nread into that facial change,\nsome interstate of yours\nthat is salient to me.\nAll of a sudden, we've\ngot this sort of dance of.\nLike, I'm noticing\nyou reacting to me,\nand that's changing the way\nI'm feeling about what I'm--\nThat's the purview of\nevery neurosis everyone\ndidn't want, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nevery relationship.\nI had a girlfriend when I was\na post-doc who was very, very--\nshe was brilliant,\nreally, still is.\nAnd she always said that\nevery relationship, there\nare four arrows.\nShe used to say she's a\nneuroscientist, still is.\nAnd said there's the arrow of--\nshe was talking to me,\nso she said, me to you\nand kind of what you\nperceive coming from me.\nAnd then there's\nyou to me, and then\nthere's an arrow from the middle\ngoing right back at of each one\nof us, which is our\nown perception of what\nthe other person is\nthinking about us,\nand it's feeding back\non the other arrow.\nAnd she gave me this\nvery clear but model\nof basically relationships.\nThe relationship failed, but\nit was good while it lasted,\nI should say.\nBut the four arrow\nmodel of relationships\nactually shows up in every type\nof one-on-one relationship,\nand is probably an\nunder description\nof the total number of arrows.\nBut is I think it's exactly\nwhat you're describing\nis that perception of self\nthrough the eyes of other\nwhether or not we're empathic\nor not strongly shapes\nthe way that we access\ndifferent context dependent rule\nsets about what we're\ngoing to say or not.\nAnd it's very dynamic, right?\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah.\nBut the freedom that I think we\nwant and people can sometimes\nexperience this\njust haphazardly,\nbut the center of the bull's\neye from the meditative point\nof view is to get off that\nride entirely and to--\nso that losing the sense\nof self in this context\nof a social encounter is to\ngive up your face, essentially.\nAnd what that entails\nis or what that gives\nyou is the free attention to\nactually just pay attention\nto the other person.\nAnd the other person\nis now no longer quite\nan object in the\nworld for you, there's\nreally just a kind of a totality\nof which that person is a part.\nAnd actually, Martin Buber,\nthe mystical Jewish philosopher\ntalked about the\nI-thou relationship.\nAnd I think it's been a long\ntime since I've read Buber.\nBut and I don't know\nif he goes far enough\nto be truly non-dualistic, but\nthere's distinction between I\nand thou because the thou\npart of it is, I think,\npotentially this.\nAgain, it's been several\ndecades since I read him.\nBut there's a way of\nbeholding another person where\nyou have the free attention\nto simply behold them.\nYou no longer care what\nthey think about you.\nYou don't feel neurotically\nimplicated by their gaze.\nYou don't feel-- you're simply\nthe space in which they're\nappearing, and so you're free.\nSo by definition, you're\nno longer self-conscious.\nAnd this phrase,\nself-consciousness, really\ndoes get at this,\nwhat I'm calling\nthe self, the illusory self\nas a kind of contraction.\nAnd you can notice\nthis for yourself.\nJust imagine what\nit's like to go\nfrom not being self-conscious to\nsuddenly being self-conscious.\nAnd the proximate\ncause of this almost\ninvariably is suddenly\nrecognizing that somebody\nis looking at you.\nIt's like you're in a\nStarbucks and you're alone\nand you're reading the\nnewspaper or whatever it is.\nAnd this now sounds\nhighly anachronistic.\nIt's been three years since\nI've held a physical newspaper\nin a Starbucks.\nBut you're just minding\nyour own business.\nAnd you look up,\nand you're seeing\na room full of strangers.\nBut then you notice that\nsomeone is just looking at you.\nAnd so that moment\nof eye contact,\nsuddenly that throws you back on\nyourself as a kind of suddenly,\nyou're the object in the\nworld for that other person.\nThat recognition is\nthe tightening there,\nthe kind of contraction there\nis a further ramification\nof this feeling most of us\nhave most of the time of being\nthe center of experience.\nIt's like we're all\nwalking around with a fist.\nAnd in moments of\nself-consciousness,\nthe fist gets really tight.\nAnd that's the thing that gets\nfully relaxed when you discover\nthis, what in various point's\ncalled the nature of mind\nor the non-dual nature\nof consciousness.\nIt's just that there is no\ncenter to this experience.\nAnd when you\nrecognize no center,\nthen even when your gaze is\naimed at another person's gaze,\nthere is no implication\ngoing back to the center\nbecause there is no center.\nAnd rather than that being an\nexperience of weird detachment\nor confusion, it's\nactually an experience\nof greater relationship because\nyou're no longer defending it.\nYou're not defending\nanything over here.\nYou're not braced\nagainst anything,\nyou're just the space in which\nthat person is showing up.\nAnd so it's an\nexperience of being\nmuch more comfortable in the\npresence of another person,\nwhatever your relationship,\nbecause you're not contracting.\nAgain, and this is meditation.\nThis is meditation that is\ntotally compatible with having\na conversation with somebody.\nAnd then when you notice\nyour self contracting,\nwhen you notice you're\nnot meditating anymore,\nyou're actually reacting.\nLike, they just said something\nor looked a certain way\nand now, you're cast\nback upon yourself\nin relationship to\nthem, that becomes\na kind of mindfulness alarm.\nThen it becomes the\nunsatisfactoriness of that.\nPsychologically becomes\nmore and more salient.\nBecause one, that's not\nthe way you want to be.\nI mean, it's like,\nit's the antithesis\nof it being as comfortable\nas you were a moment ago.\nBut two, it's something\nyou're doing unnecessarily.\nit's like, again, you're\nmaking a fist when\nyou don't have to make a fist.\nAgain, you can leave aside\nall those circumstances\nwhere it's appropriate\nto react to someone.\nAnd I'm into martial\narts and self defense.\nAnd yes, you're not supposed\nto be just this puddle of goo\nout in the world who can be\njust mistreated by people\nand never put up resistance.\nBut it's psychologically\neven if a state like anger\nor contraction is sometimes\nnormative and appropriate,\nthe question is, how long is it\nnormative and appropriate for?\nHow long do you want\nto stay angry for?\nIn my experience, these kind of\nclassically negative emotions\nlike anger and fear are\nappropriate as salience cues.\nThey orient you to an emergency\nor a potential emergency.\nBut then in dealing\nwith the emergency,\nthey're almost never the\nstate you want to be in.\nLike, it's better to actually be\ncalm in an emergency in a way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, absolutely.\nAnd again, the language is\ninsufficient to describe\nwhat you're telling us.\nBut I think what\ncomes to mind for me\nis this distinction between\nsituational awareness\nand self-awareness.\nAnd we need both\nbut under conditions\nof emergency, true emergency,\nor motivated desire.\nWe need to dial down the\namount of self-awareness\nin order to be more effective\nwithin the situational\nawareness.\nBut you said something\nvery important.\nAnd my lab has been\nworking on fear-like states\nfor a long time, so I confess\nI'm going to rob this from you,\nbut I'll credit you\nevery time I describe it,\nis that the fear of the\nthreat detection state\nor set of events acts\nas a flag but is not\nmeant to persist in the\nway that the flag went up\nif one is to be in their\nmost adaptive state.\nActually, Jocko Willink and\nI were talking about this.\nHe talks a lot about detachment\nand open gaze, things\nthat my lab is interested in\nvisual system and autonomic\ninteractions.\nSo why broadening\nthe gaze literally\nbroadens the time\ndomain of thinking\nand you come up\nwith new solutions\nto complex problems in\nreal time and so on.\nAnd you're describing\nan everyday set\nof interactions where\nthat could be very useful.\nAnd yet, there seems to be\nsomething that about the way\nyou describe meditation and\nwhat you've managed to arrive at\nand what practitioners of\nmeditation can arrive at,\nwhich is something\nmore than that.\nIt's not just about being\neffective or optimizing,\nall the language we see thrown\naround a lot in the space\nthat I live in these days, but\nsomething fundamentally more\nimportant about how to\nexperience life and the self.\nThis realization\nthat what you thought\nwas there was\nnever really there,\nbut that there are\nconstraints that limit that.\nAnd so to try and fracture\nthose constraints one by one.\nWould you say that\nmeditation as a practice done\nfor a few minutes each day\nor with the app, that it's\nkind of a step function?\nIs it very non-linear in\nterms of people's progress?\nI'm certainly going to go start\ndoing more meditation based\non this discussion, truly.\nBecause any time\nsomeone describes\nthat there's kind of a myth\nthat we've been living in,\nI become obsessed with the\nidea of dissolving that myth.\nThat's a very seductive\nphrase, so thank you\nfor using that one.\nThere is no better\nmarketing tool,\nwhich is I realize what\nyou're not trying to do here.\nBut that's for me to\ncapture my efforts.\nYou tell me that there's\na myth that I'm living in\nand that it can be\ndissolved, and that opens up\na better landscape.\nWhat is the process like?\nDo some people make\nprogress very quickly?\nDo some people experience\nkind of step functions\ntowards progress?\nWhat does the meditation\npractice look like over time?\nDo you still meditate or\nhave you just threaded it\nthrough your jujitsu, your\nwriting, your daily life,\nyour coffee, your time\nwith your wife, et cetera?\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah,\nalso just to come back\nto talk about the\nmyth for a second.\nSo what you just enunciated\nwas a kind of a second doorway\ninto this whole project.\nSo like, the usual door is\nthrough the door of suffering,\nfor lack of a better word.\nWhen people feel unhappy in\na variety of ways and they\nget more sensitized\nto the mechanics\nof their own unhappiness.\nAnd meditation is\none of the things\non the menu that\nis explicitly built\nas a remedy for unhappiness.\nAnd it is.\nAnd that's I think\nthat's probably\nthe most common path to this.\nBut another path is just\nintellectual interest.\nI mean, just wanting\nto know what's\nreal about the mind subjectively\nin a first person way.\nAnd there's no contradiction\nbetween those two things,\nand I'm motivated\nby both of them.\nBut it's a totally\nvalid doorway into this.\nThere are definitely\nstep functions.\nI mean, I would say\nthere are at least two,\nand they really are\narticulated along\nthe lines of the\nframework I've been\ndescribing of dualistic and\nnon-dualistic mindfulness.\nSo in the beginning,\nyou're going to start out--\n99.9% of people will start out\ndualistically paying attention\nand noticing the difference\nbetween being distracted\nby thought and then being\non the object of attention,\nwhether it's the breath\nor sounds or whatever.\nAnd eventually, that opens\nup to all possible objects\nof attention,\nincluding thoughts.\nAnd there's still\nthis fluctuation\nbetween being distracted and\nthen being mindful of whatever.\nAnd the fact that it's open\nto all possible objects\ndifferentiates this\ntype of practice\nfrom anything that is\nnarrowly focused on one\nobject like a mantra\nor a visualization\nas I was just saying.\nThose are other\npaths of practice\nthat are more\nconcentration-based and\ninteresting.\nBut the benefit of mindfulness\nis that very quickly, you\nrealize it's by definition\ncompatible with all possible\nexperience, because\nyou're not artificially\ncontracting your attention\ndown to something,\nyou're just being aware\nof the next thing.\nA sight, a sound,\na taste, a thought.\nSo the first step function\nis to very clearly experience\nthe difference between\nbeing lost in thought\nand being clearly aware\nof any part of experience,\nincluding thought.\nAnd to notice the freedom,\nthe comparative psychological\nfreedom that gives.\nSo something's made you\nangry and now you're\nthinking about all\nthe reasons why\nyou should be angry and\nhave every right to be angry\nand what you're going to tell\nthat person when you see them,\nand then you notice\nyou're thinking.\nAnd you notice the connection\nbetween the thought\nand the anger.\nLike, the minute spent lost\nin thought about what's\nmaking you angry\nis the thing that\ndragged through the\nphysiology of anger.\nAnd the moment you notice\nthat once you're mindful,\nonce you can be mindful, you\ncan notice thought as thought\nand how quickly that dissipates.\nThat's just the language\nand the imagery.\nYou couldn't hold on\nto it if you wanted to.\nAnd then you notice the\nphysiology of the anger\nis just this kind\nof meaningless,\nkind of inner incandescence\nthat has its own half\nlife and degrades very,\nvery quickly when you're\nno longer thinking\nabout the reasons\nwhy you should be angry.\nYou can't hold on to the anger,\nthe anger itself dissipates.\nAnd from the point of view of\nthe one who's being mindful,\nthis is tremendous relief.\nAnd at minimum, it's\na degree of freedom.\nYou can at that point\ndecide, well, how long\ndo I want to be angry for?\nIs it useful to stay angry?\nDo I want to be angry for\none minute, two minutes, five\nminutes, 10 minutes?\nAnd before you have that\ncapacity to be mindful,\nyou're going to\nhelplessly be as angry\nas you're going to be\nfor as long as you're\ngoing to be that way\njust based on the time\ncourse of your thinking\nabout it, brooding about it,\ntelling your wife about it.\nIt's just going to be this\nconversation-based misadventure\nin negative states\nof mind, and you\nare going to be the\nhostage of that for as long\nas you'll be the\nhostage of that.\nYou have nothing\nyou can do apart\nfrom just deciding to check\nout and watch Game of Thrones\nagain for the third time.\nYou can divert your attention\nto something else, which is\nsometimes a good thing to do.\nBut mindfulness, even\ndualistic mindfulness\ngives you this capacity to just\nobserve the mechanics of this\nand then get off the\nride whenever you want.\nSo that really is\na step function.\nFirst, there was a time\nbefore you could do that,\nand then there's a time\nafter which you can do that.\nThe other step function\nis noticing that there\nis no one who is doing that.\nI mean, this is the\nnon-duality, the selflessness,\nthe centralessness of awareness.\nThe fact that there's no place\nfrom which the mindfulness is\nbeing aimed but the\nfact that there's just\nthis open condition in which\neverything is appearing,\nthoughts included.\nTo have you at that point, your\nmindfulness no longer becomes--\nit's no longer this\ndualistic effort\nto strategically pay\nattention to anything\nas opposed to being\nlost in thought,\nit's just what's left when\nthe present recognized\nthought unravels.\nEven before it unravels,\nwhat's recognized\nis you are simply identical\nto the condition in which\neverything is appearing.\nNow, again, I'm not making\na Deepak Chopra-like\nmetaphysical claim\nabout the mind.\nI'm not saying the mind isn't\nwhat the brain is doing,\nand I'm not saying\nthat you're recognizing\nthe consciousness that\ngave birth to the universe.\nI'm not making any broad\nclaims about metaphysics,\nI'm just talking about as\na matter of experience.\nThere is just this condition in\nwhich everything is appearing.\nAnd what you're\ncalling your body,\nagain, as a matter\nof experience--\nI'm not saying that we\ncan't have third person\nconversations about physical\nbodies in the physical world.\nBut as a matter of\nexperience, the only body\nyou're ever going to directly\nencounter as your own\nis in appearance\nand consciousness.\nSo consciousness is\nnot in your body,\nwhat you're calling your\nbody is in consciousness.\nVisually, proprioceptively,\nit's like everything is just\nappearing in this condition.\nAnd again, this\nis not a spotlight\nthat you're aiming\nat the body, there's\njust this condition in which\neverything, including anything\nyou could call\nyourself is appearing.\nAnd so yeah, the\nsecond step function\nis to recognize that\nthis is already true.\nConsciousness is already\nwithout this thing\nyou've been calling your\nego and hoping to unravel it\nthrough meditation.\nConsciousness is not going to\nget any more selfless, any more\ncenterless, any freer\nthan it always already\nis recognized as such.\nAnd so the step\nfunction at that point\nis your mindfulness\nat that point,\nthe thing you come back to when\nyou're no longer distracted\nis that recognition\nagain and again.\nAnd then it becomes compatible\nwith anything you would do.\nAnd so to answer\nyour question, yes,\nI still practice formally,\nsometimes, frequently.\nBut I definitely miss days\nand I don't do it for--\nI mean, I don't rule\nout the possibility\nthat I will go back on\nretreat at various times\njust to check in with that and\nsee if that makes a difference.\nBut I tend to sit for--\nI mean, I've designed\nmy life so that I\ncan spend a lot\nof time meditating\nwithout having to be\nformally meditating.\nLike, so, I'll go for\na hike for two hours.\nAnd what I'm doing\nwhen I'm hiking\nis identical to what I'm doing\nwhen I'm quote, \"meditating\",\nsitting in a chair, doing\nnothing but meditate.\nSo yeah, I'm very\ninterested in erasing\nthe boundary between what\npeople are calling meditation\nand the rest of life.\nAnd so in teaching\nthese things, I\ntend to emphasize that\nfrom the beginning\nbecause I think it's\nvery easy to set up--\nto get gold by a\nbunch of assumptions\nthat cause you to be\nvery split in your sense\nof what your life is about.\nAnd I'm sort of banking\nmy meditation over here\nbecause I'm meditating two\nhours a day diligently,\nand it's going to be\nreally good for me.\nAnd then over here, this is the\nrest of my life, which is not\nnearly as wise or as\nuseful or as like,\nthis is the stuff that is\nstill the area of my problems.\nAnd I think it's useful to\nrecognize you've got one life,\nand you've got this single\ncondition of consciousness,\nand its contents in\nevery mode of life.\nAnd there's something\nto recognize about it.\nAnd you're always free\nto recognize that.\nAnd truly even in your dreams.\nI mean, it never stops.\nSo that's what I\ntend to emphasize.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nearlier, you told us\nthat meditation is not\nabout changing the content\nof conscious experience.\nAnd in a different\npodcast that you were on,\nI heard you say something to\nthe effect of that normally we\nare in our daily experience\nand unless we are trained\nin meditation, unless\nwe've dissolved\nthis illusion of the gap between\nactor and self and observer,\nthat we require certain sensory\nevents to create collisions\nwithin us and with the natural\nworld that sort of blast us\ninto a different mode of being.\nI want to use that\nas a way to frame up\nthis idea that some things\nsuch as psychedelics\nbut also a very long hike,\na very long fast, who knows?\nA banquet, different\ntypes of life experiences\ndo exactly the opposite of what\nyou're describing meditation\ndoes, which is\nthat they actively\nchange the content of\nour conscious experience\nso much so that we\noften remember those\nfor the rest of our lives.\nCould you tell us why\npsychedelics can be useful?\nAnd here, I'll give the\ncaveats that maybe you'll\nfeel obligated to give as well,\nbut we're talking about safely\nand responsibly,\nage-appropriate,\ncontext-appropriate, ideally\nwith some clinical or other\ntype of guidance, legality\nissues, obeyed, et cetera.\nAll that stated, it\nwas psychedelics to me\nare an experience of\naltered perception,\ninternal and external\nperception, altered space time\nrelationship,\nsomewhat dreamlike.\nI think it was Alan Hobson at\nHarvard for a long time talked\nabout the relationship between\npsychedelic-like states\nand dream-like states because\nof this distortion of space time\ndimensionality.\nAnd I haven't experimented\nwith them much.\nI've been part of a clinical\ntrial, three doses of MDMA,\nwhich certainly\naltered the quality\nof my conscious\nexperience in ways\nthat led to a lot of\nlasting and at least for me,\nvaluable learning.\nSo what are your what are your\nthoughts about psychedelics\nin terms of how they\nintersect with the discussion\nthat we've been having?\nAnd what utility do they play\nin recognition of the self\nor in other sorts\nof brain changes?\nSAM HARRIS: Well so, let's\njust price in all those caveats\nthat people can anticipate.\nThese drugs are not\nwithout their risks.\nAnd one problem is that we\nhave this single-term drugs\nor psychedelics, which\nnames many different types\nof substances, and\nthey're not all the same.\nSo like, MDMA is not even\ntechnically a psychedelic.\nI think it has immense\ntherapeutic value,\nand it actually\nwas my gateway drug\nto this whole area of concern.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAmphetamine pathogen, right?\nIt's a sort of an\namphetamine and a pathogen\nat the same time.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, I mean\nit's, often called--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: M pathogens.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah,\nand a pathogen--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a\npathogen, M pathogen.\nSAM HARRIS: And a pathogen or\nan entactogen, it's been called.\nBut it doesn't tend to\nchange perception in the way\nthat classic psychedelics do.\nAnd it's also serotonergic,\nbut it has to be in some part\ndifferently.\nAnd even LSD and psilocybin,\nwhich are much more similar\nand classic psychedelics,\nboth are also serotonergic\nbut they're not merely,\nand they're also different.\nAnd the higher dose you take\nof these drugs, the more--\nat lower doses everything,\ncan kind of seem the same.\nAt higher doses, they\nbegin to diverge.\nAnd we can talk about the\npharmacology if you wanted to.\nBut I would just say\nthat for many of us,\nand certainly for\nme, psychedelics\nwere indispensable in the\nbeginning in proving to me\nthat this was--\nthe first person interrogation\nof the mind was worth doing.\nBecause I was somebody\nwho at age 17 or 18,\nbefore I had any real experience\nwith MDMA or LSD or psilocybin,\nif you had taught me how\nto meditate at that point,\nI think I would have just\nbounced off the whole project.\nI think I was so cerebral\nin just my engagement\nwith anything.\nI was so skeptical of any of\nthe religious and spiritual\ntraditions that have given us\nmost of our meditation talk\nthat I think I just would have--\nAnd I know many of these people.\nI have tried to teach Richard\nDawkins to meditate and Daniel\nDennett to meditate.\nI've ambushed them\nwith meditation\nboth in a group\nsetting and one-on-one.\nNot Dan but Richard, I\nambushed on my own podcast\nwith a guided meditation.\nAnd he closes his\neyes, he looks inside,\nand there's nothing\nof interest to see.\nHe doesn't have the\nconceptual interest in him\nthat would cause him to\npersist long enough to find out\nthat there's a there there.\nNow, this is not a problem\nwith LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.\nI know that if I gave\nhim 100 micrograms of LSD\nor 5 grams of mushrooms or\n25 milligrams of psilocybin--\nthat's probably not\nthe analogous dosage\nto the 5 grams of mushrooms.\n5 grams of mushrooms\nwould be more than that.\nI forget what it is of\nMDMA, maybe 120 milligrams.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nthe maps dose, which\nis the one that's under clinical\ntrials is 125 milligrams\nwith an option of a\n75 milligram booster.\nFunny, I remember it.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah,\nthat's strange,\nthe facts that come to hand.\nBut there's just no\npossibility that nothing's\ngoing to happen right now.\nSomething with a psychedelic,\nwith MDMA, most people\ntend to have certainly\nunder any kind of guidance,\ntend to have a very positive,\npro-social experience.\nBut with a\npsychedelic, you might\nhave a somewhat\nterrifying experience\nif you have quote, a bad trip.\nAnd I've certainly\nhad those experiences\non LSD and to some\ndegree, on psilocybin.\nBut the prospect that\nnothing is going to happen\nis just in nearly a million\ncases out of a million just\nnot in the cards.\nI mean, just\nneurophysiologically,\nsomething is going to happen\nwith the requisite dose of one\nof these drugs.\nAnd if that thing that\nhappens is psychologically\nat all normative and pleasant\nand interesting and valuable,\nwhich it is so much of\nthe time and certainly\nunder the appropriate set\nand setting and guidance,\nit can be a lot of the time\nfor virtually everybody.\nAgain, there are caveats.\nIf you're prone,\nif you think you\nhave a proclivity for\nschizophrenia or bipolar\ndisorder, this is almost\ncertainly not for you.\nAnd anyone doing the\nstudies at Johns Hopkins\nfor the therapeutic effects\nof any of these drugs,\nthey're there ruling\nout people with--\nfirst degree relatives with any\nof these clinical conditions.\nSo for somebody\nlike me at 18 who\ndidn't know that this was\nan area of not only interest\nbut would it be the\ncenter of gravity\nfor the rest of his life, if\nonly he could pay attention\nclearly enough to\nsee that it could be,\nI was someone who very likely--\nagain, I don't have the\ncounterfactual in hand.\nI don't know what\nwould have happened\nif someone had\nforced me to meditate\nfor an hour at that point.\nBut I know I wasn't interested\nin it until I took MDMA.\nI know I wasn't having\nthese kinds of experiences\nspontaneously that\nshowed me that there\nwas an inner landscape\nthat was worth exploring.\nI was a very hard-headed skeptic\nwho was very interested in lots\nof things, but there was no\nalternative to me just thinking\nmore about those things.\nI mean, the idea that there's\nsome other way of grasping\ncognitively at the\ninteresting parts of the world\nbeyond thinking about the\nworld, that just wouldn't\nhave computed for me at all.\nNo one ever gave me a book\nto read or I never had--\nThe noun, meditation,\nvery likely\nmeant absolutely nothing to me\nbefore I took my first dose of,\nin this case it was MDMA.\nSo what the drug experience\ndid for me is it just proved--\nSo one of the\nlimitations of drug\nis that, obviously, no matter\nhow good the experience,\nthe drug wears off\nand then you're\nback to in more or\nless your usual form,\nand now you have a\nmemory of the experience.\nAnd it can be a\nfairly dim memory.\nI mean, some of\nthese experiences\nare so discontinuous with\nnormal waking consciousness\nthat it can be like\ntrying to remember\na dream that just degrades\nover the course of seconds.\nAnd then it could have been the\nmost intense dream you've ever\nhad and for whatever reason,\nyou can barely get a purchase\non what it was about.\nAnd there are some\npsychedelic experiences\nthat are analogous to that.\nBut for most people\nmost of the time,\nthere's a residue\nof this experience.\nAnd with something like MDMA,\nthey can be quite vivid.\nWhere you recognize there\nwas a way of being that\nis quite different than what I'm\ntending to access by default,\nand it is different\nin ways that are just\nobviously better and\npsychologically more healthy.\nI mean, it's possible to\nbe healthy psychologically\nin a way that I never imagined.\nAnd then when you link it up\nto the traditional literature\naround any of this stuff,\nagain, so much of it\nis shot through\nwith superstition\nand other worldliness\nof religion.\nAnd as you know and I think\nyou're listeners probably know,\nI've spent a lot of time\ncriticizing all that.\nBut there is a baby in the\nbathwater to all of that.\nIt's not that somebody\nlike Jesus or the Buddha\nor any of the matriarchs and\npatriarchs of the world's\nreligions, it's not that they\nwere all conscious frauds\nor temporal lobe epileptics,\nthere's a pathological lens\nthat you can put\non top of all that.\nBut once you have one of these\nexperiences on psychedelics\nor on a drug like MDMA, you\nknow that there's a there there.\nYou know that unconditional\nlove is a possibility.\nYou know that feeling\ntruly one with nature.\nI mean, just so one\nwith nature that you\ncould spend 10 hours\nin front of a tree\nand find that to be the\nmost rewarding experience\nof your life.\nThat's a possible\nstate of consciousness.\nNow, it may not be the\nstate of consciousness\nyou want all the time.\nYou don't want to\nbe the crazy guy\nby the tree you\nknow who can't have\na conversation\nabout anything else.\nBut once you have one\nof these experiences,\nyou recognize, OK, there's\nsome reason why I'm not having\nthe beatific vision right now.\nAnd I can't even figure out\nhow to aim my attention so as\nto have anything like it.\nAnd that's a problem,\nbecause it's available,\nand it is among the best things\nthat has ever happened to me.\nAnd now I can just only dimly\nremember what that was like.\nSo how do I get back\nthere on some level?\nSo that invites, again,\na logic of changes.\nA logic of seeking changes in\nthe contents of consciousness,\nwhich sets someone up for\nthis protracted or seemingly\nprotracted and fairly\nfrustrating search\nto game their\nnervous system so as\nto have those kinds of\nexperiences more and more.\nAnd again, it's not that\nthat's in principle fruitless\nbut it is from the point of\nview of the core insight,\nthe core wisdom of\nwhat I would take\nfrom a tradition like\nBuddhism, which is not\nthe only tradition that\nhas given voice to this,\nbut I would argue it's\ngiven it voice to it\nin the most articulate way.\nAgain, leaving aside\nany of the superstition\nand other worldliness\nand miracles that we\ndon't have to talk\nabout at the moment.\nAnd you certainly don't\nneed to endorse in order\nto be interested in this stuff.\nAnd so that's the\nbifurcation between all\nof the utility of\npsychedelics and what\nI'm talking about under\nthe rubric of meditation\nis at this point of OK, once you\nrealize there's a there there,\nwhat do you do?\nAnd what's the logic by\nwhich you're led to do it?\nAnd it's possible if\nyou're only framework\nis the good\nexperiences, the good\nfeels you had on\nwhatever drug it was\nand a further discussion of\nwhat that path of changes\ncan look like--\nand that can become in\na religious context,\nit can come in just a\npurely psychedelic context\nor some combination of the two.\nI think you can be\nmisled to just seek\nlots of peak experiences.\nYou're just trying\nto string together\na lot of peak experiences hoping\nthey're going to change you,\nevery one of which,\nby definition is\ngoing to be impermanent.\nIt's first it wasn't\nthere, then it's there,\nand then it's no longer there.\nAnd then you've\ngot a memory of it.\nWhat I think what\neveryone really\nwants whether they know it or\nnot, and they're right to want,\nis a type of freedom that\nis compatible with even\nordinary states of\nconsciousness, which\ncan ride along with them\ninto extraordinary states\nof consciousness.\nSo I hadn't done\npsychedelics for 25 years\nbecause, again, they were super\nuseful for me in the beginning,\nthen I discovered meditation on\nthe basis of those experiences,\ngot really into\nmeditation and realized,\nOK, this is a much more--\nconceptually, this makes\nmuch more sense to me.\nThis is delivering the goods\nin terms of my experience.\nThere's no need to\nkeep having these--\nseeking these peak\nexperiences with drugs.\nBut it had been 25 years\nsince I had done that\nand there was this resurgence\nin research on psychedelics.\nAnd I was being asked\nabout psychedelics,\nand I was talking about\ntheir utility for me,\nbut again, these were\ndistant memories.\nAnd there was also one type\nof psychedelic experience\nI was aware that\nI had never had.\nI had never done a high dose\nof mushrooms blindfolded.\nEvery mushroom trip\nI'd ever had I'd\nbeen out in nature\nand interacting with--\nit's just been a very\ntransformed sensory experience\nof the world and\nof other people.\nBut I'd never done it\nalone, blindfolded,\njust purely inwardly directed,\nand at a high dosage.\nI'd done high doses of\nLSD but not mushrooms.\nSo I did that and\nit was very useful.\nAnd I spoke about it on my\npodcast, and there's actually--\nI think if you search\n\"Sam Harris mushroom\ntrip\" on YouTube, you\nget the 19 minute version\nof my describing that trip.\nIt was incredibly useful,\nbut what was doubly useful\nwas my mindfulness training in\nthe context of that explosion\nof synesthesia.\nI mean, it was such an\noverwhelmingly strong\nexperience, and there\nwere so many moments where\nit could have gone\none way or the other\nbased on my sense\nof just, OK, I'm\ngoing to try to resist this.\nIt was in truth irresistible\nbecause it was just so much,\nbut there were moments where\nI was aware of, OK, this is--\nletting go of self\nin this context\nis the thing that\nis going to make\nthe difference between\nheaven and hell\nhere because there\nare experiences that\nare so extreme\nthat you can't even\ntell if it's agony or ecstasy.\nEverything is turned up to 11.\nAnd the difference\nbetween the two is--\nthe tipping point is just--\nreally it's a high\nwire act in some sense.\nYou could just fall to\none side or the other.\nYeah, so what I think\npeople want is--\nthey certainly want\nto be able to extract\nfrom the psychedelic\nexperience, wisdom\nthat is applicable to ordinary\nstates of consciousness.\nIt's like, what is the\nthing you can realize\nin a moment of\nhaving a conversation\nwith your child that\nisn't distracting you\nfrom that relationship?\nIt's not a memory of\nwhen the world dissolved\nor when you were\nindistinguishable from the sky,\nbut it's just a way of\nhaving free attention\nand unconditional\nlove in this totally\nordinary and potentially\nchaotic human experience, which\ncan be psychologically\nfraught and you\ncan meet iterations\nof yourself that you\ndon't like that\nare not equipping\nyou to be the best possible\nperson in that relationship.\nAnd what we want to do is\ncut through all of that\nand actually be in\nlove with our lives\nand with the people in our\nlives more and more of the time.\nAnd I'm not saying that repeated\npsychedelic journeys can't\nbe integral to that\nproject, but you\nknow that the project can't\nbe being high all the time.\nSo whatever is extractable from\nthe occasional psychedelic trip\nhas got to be manageable into\nordinary waking consciousness.\nAnd the real point of contact\ndoes run through this--\nwhat I've been calling\nthe illusion of the self.\nAnd again, that part\nis discoverable without\nany changes in contents.\nSo you don't have to suddenly\nfeel the energy of your body\nrush out and be continuous\nwith the ocean of energy that\nis not your body.\nThat's an experience\nthat's there to be had,\nI mean, there's no doubt.\nBut the truth is just\nlooking at this cup\nis just as formless and\nas mysterious as that when\nseen in the right\nway, and that's\nwhat meditation encourages\none to recognize.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nshare the experience\nthat MDMA significantly\naltered my perception of what's\npossible in terms of an\nemotional stance towards self\nand others, including\nanimals, something that\nruns very deep for me and that\nI had been actively suppressing\nin anticipation of having\nme put my dog down.\nBut also, I don't know how\nto frame it except to say,\nmy lab did animal\nresearch for years,\nand I was always very conflicted\nabout it because I love animals\nand yet I wanted to\nunderstand the brain\nand we need to work on\nanimal brains, and we--\nSAM HARRIS: Rodents or what?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'll\nbe very direct about this.\nI've worked on many species.\nI've worked on mice and rats.\nAdmittedly, I've worked on--\nI've done some cat experiments.\nI've worked on large, non-human\nprimates including macaques.\nI no longer work on\nany of those species.\nI've worked on cuttlefish,\ncephalopods, a discussion\nfor another time, brilliant\nlittle creatures, maybe\nas smart as us, or who knows?\nMaybe smarter.\nAnd now I work on humans\nbecause I couldn't reconcile\nthe challenge inside me,\nwhich was my love of animals\nand working on them.\nI just couldn't\ndo it any longer.\nAnd MDMA didn't set\nthat transition,\nthat transition actually\nhad been set a lot earlier.\nIt's something I\nreally grappled with.\nIt didn't keep me up at\nnight, but it was always\nin the back of my mind.\nIn any event, I hope\nwhat we discovered\nwas worthwhile, but this\nthat's a bigger debate.\nAnd I've strong\nfeelings about this,\nand maybe it's a topic\nfor another podcast.\nBut I'm very happy that\nnow I work on humans,\nand they can tell\nme if they want\nto be part of the\nexperiment or not,\nand I trust them and\nI trust their answers.\nI think that MDMA, in its role\nas an pathogen, I think really\ndid set an understanding\nof what's real and true.\nSo I think truths\nlike that become--\nI felt that they didn't\nhit me square in the face.\nThe feeling behind the\nconflict made itself evident,\nand what to do about\nit made itself evident.\nSo I suppose MDMA did\nassist the transition\nto purely human research, as\nopposed to animal research.\nThe other thing that\nI noticed it did\nis it made it not\nscary to confront\nthings that were scary to\nconfront in my conscious life.\nAnd I could think about\nthings in my conscious life,\nbut it brought\nthem close in a way\nthat I could get closer\nand closer to the flame\nand then gain some\nunderstanding.\nI'm still amazed at how answers\narrive, both during the session\nand in the weeks and\nmonths that follow if one\nputs the attention to it.\nI think that's why\nit's important to have\na guide of some sort\nor to have some pseudo\nstructure because otherwise\none can get attached\nto the sounds in the room.\nAnd there's probably\nmeaning there,\nbut I wanted to do\nsome deeper work.\nI have not had experience\nwith psilocybin, at least\nnot since my youth.\nAnd I don't recommend\nyoung people do it.\nI regret doing LSD and\npsilocybin as a young person.\nI don't say that for politically\ncorrect reasons or liability\nreasons, I just think my\nmind was not developed.\nBut I'm intrigued by something--\nso here's the question--\nhow is it that psilocybin\nin particular and high dose\npsilocybin and the ego\ndissolution that people\ntalk about on psilocybin--\nhow do you think that lines up\nwith some of the\nexperiences that you've\nbeen describing for a\nadequate meditation practice?\nBecause that's something that\nI did not experience on MDMA.\nIn fact, if anything, I\nexperienced for the first time\nwhat really feeling like\na isolated container was,\nand the difference-- and how\nempathy and being bounded--\nhaving, in other words,\ngood boundaries and empathy\ncould be symbiotic.\nI experienced that for\nthe first time there.\nAnd I do think that\nthere is learning inside\nof these states that\ntranslates into everyday life\nwhen one is not on these states.\nAnd the last thing\nI'll say is, no, I\ndon't feel the impulse to go\nand do 20 more MDMA sessions.\nI think the three as\npart of this study\nwere very effective for me.\nAs I say, if you hear the\ncalling again you might do it,\nbut I'm very curious about\npsilocybin in particular\nand this notion\nof ego dissolution\nbecause we've been\ntalking about the self.\nSAM HARRIS: Well, so\nthere are different ways\nIn which the sense of self\ncan be eroded or expanded.\nThere's lots of experiences that\ncan still have a center to them\nbut be very novel\nand transformational.\nAnd one can reify\nthose as a goal state.\nThere's a concept in Buddhism\nthat I think is useful.\nIt doesn't translate\nwell to English,\nor it can set up false\nassociations in English\nthat are unfortunate.\nBut so there's a concept of\nemptiness in Buddhism, which\nsounds, again, gray and\ndispiriting in English,\nbut it's cognate terms are\nthings like unconditioned,\nunconstrained, open, centralist.\nWhen I'm talking\nabout non duality,\nwhen I'm talking about the\nloss of a sense of subject\nand then what's\nleft, in Buddhism,\nthey would often describe\nwhat's left as emptiness.\nBut an emptiness\nis not a something.\nImportantly, it's not\nthe same thing as unity,\nso it's not a oneness\nbecause it's--\nWhen the center drops\nout of experience,\nit's not like you are\nsuddenly merged with the cup.\nNow, granted, this is\nwhere psilocybin and other\npsychedelics can give\na false impression of I\nthink what the goal is.\nYou can have seeming\nmerging experiences--\nyou can have unity experiences\non psychedelics, which\ncan be quite powerful,\nespecially with other people\nand with nature,\nwhere you can just\nfeel the energy of\nyour body becomes\nincredibly vivid and powerful.\nIt's like everything is just\nbuzzing with life energy.\nAnd then when you touch\nanother person's hand\nor you touch a\ntree, there can be\nthis continuity of\nenergy, which can be\nthis overwhelming experience.\nAnd again, this is\na 20 megaton change\nin the contents\nof consciousness.\nThis is a non ordinary\nstate of consciousness.\nTo give some indication\nof how this happens--\nback in the day\nwhen I was in my 20s\nand I was experimenting with--\nthis was LSD, but\nsome friends and I\nhad decided-- we had\nthis brilliant idea.\nWe would camp above Muir woods\nand then take some LSD at dawn\nand then walk down like a\nmile I think from the campsite\ninto the actual\nproper grove of trees\nand commune with the giant\nredwoods, the tallest\ntrees on Earth.\nAnd so we dropped the acid at\ndawn, and we start walking,\nbut the acid came on\nalmost immediately.\nAnd we didn't get--\nI mean, we got nowhere\nnear the woods,\nand we got stopped by\na tree that was just\nlike an ordinary\n20 foot oak tree,\nthe most boring\ntree in the world.\nAnd that tree absorbed\nthe next six hours\nof our conscious attention\nbecause it was just--\nit was the tree of life.\nI mean, there could\nbe no better tree.\nSo we're talking about\nnonordinary states\nof consciousness wherein\na merging with life\nand with the world is possible.\nSo I'm not saying that kind\nof experience isn't possible,\nbut there's a sort of\nexpanded self reification.\nIt is a kind of ego dissolution,\nbut there's a kind of egoity\nthat goes along for\nthe ride as well,\nor can go along for the ride.\nAnd the real insight into\nemptiness, the real centerless\ncenter of the bull's eye is a\nrecognition that in some ways\nequalizes all experiences.\nAnd again, it's just\nas available now\nin this ordinary\npodcasting experience\nas it is when you're merging\nhands on with an oak tree,\nand on 400 micrograms of acid,\nand this is the whole universe.\nAnd so it's the equality\nof those two experiences\nthat this concept of\nemptiness captures, which\na concept of oneness doesn't\nquite capture because oneness\nis really this peak experience\nof being dragged out\nof your somethingness into\na much bigger somethingness.\nEmptiness is just\nno center and then\neverything is in its own place.\nThere's still sights, and\nsounds, and sensations,\nand thoughts, and feelings, but\nthere's no there's no center\nand there's no\nclinging to anything.\nThere's no clinging\nto identity, there's\nno clinging to the good\nstuff, there's no there's\nno resistance to the bad stuff.\nSo pleasant and unpleasant\nget strangely equalized,\nand it's very expansive.\nAnd most importantly, it\ndoesn't block anything.\nSo yeah, if for whatever\nreason if your nervous system\nis set up to have\nthe, oh my god, I'm\nnow merging with the\ntree experience, that's\npossible from the\nstate of no center.\nAnd on my recent--\nnow not so recent,\nthree years ago, it\nwas right before COVID,\nbut my last big psychedelic\nexperience, I was very\nmuch experiencing that.\nWhereas, insofar as I--\nat the peak, there was no me\nto remember any of this stuff.\nBut insofar as I could\nexperiment with--\nis this really different\nfrom anything else?\nThere is a equalizing to\nthe emptiness recognition,\neven in the presence of\na completely transformed\nneurophysiology.\nAgain, there's a\npoint of contact.\nI mean, the real point of\ncontact between psychedelics\nand meditation for me is--\nbut for my experiences\non psychedelics,\nI think there's\njust no way I would\nhave had the free attention to\nbe interested in the project\nat all.\nAnd there are other\naspects to the project.\nIt's not just having this\ninsight into selflessness,\nit's all of the ethical\nramifications of that.\nIt's just like, what kind\nof person do you want to be?\nWhat are your values?\nWhat is a good life,\naltogether, when\nyou are talking\nabout relationships,\nand political engagement,\nand the changes you can\nmake in the world or not make?\nIt's just, what kind of\nperson do you want to be?\nThere's a much\nlarger consideration.\nAnd I mean, as you discovered,\nan experience on MDMA\ncan really both expand your\nmodel of what is possible,\nand what is desirable,\nwhat is normative.\nI mean, just what kind of self\ndo you want to be in the world?\nAnd it can also help\nyou cut through things\nthat are inhibiting\nyour actualizing any\nof those possibilities in\nordinary waking consciousness.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I've certainly\nfound that to be the case.\nI mean, you raise a really\nimportant point, which\nis that once these\nlearnings take place,\nthese understandings\ntake place inside\nof psychedelic journeys--\nI do believe they translate\nto neuroplasticity.\nI do want to highlight\nthe point for people.\nOftentimes people\nsay, oh, you know,\nthis mushroom or\nthis psychedelic\nit opens plasticity, but\nof course, plasticity\nhas to be directed someplace.\nPlasticity is just a process\nlike walking or anything\nelse, underlying neural process.\nAnd I think it's\nimpossible for me\nto understand what\ncompartments of my life\nhave been impacted by\nthese three MDMA sessions.\nBut in some ways, I\nwonder whether or not,\nnot just the transition\naway from animal research,\nbut also a deeper\nrealization of the love\nfor learning and\nsharing information.\nI won't go so far as\nto say this podcast\nis happening because of\nthat particular session,\nbut these things they splay\nout into multiple domains\nof the self.\nAnd I do think that\nthe key features that\nfeel most important\nto me to mention\nare that it really identified\ntrue loves, things that I truly\nlove, and made me less\ncautious about feeling\nhow intense those\nloves really are.\nAnd then also lowered\nthe inhibition point\nof exploring, well,\nwhat would that mean?\nAnd one of the reasons\nI bring this up,\nand why I think it's so\nimportant that you mentioned\nsome issues around\npolitics and ethics\nand that many things\nhave splayed out\nfrom your exploration of\npsychedelics, meditation,\nneuroscience, philosophy,\nall the things that are you,\nand of course, that's only\na subset, is that so much\nof what I hear and see, so\nmuch of what I hear and see\nin the self-help space,\ncontradicts itself and leads\nback to the origin\nwithout a lot of progress.\nFor instance, we\nhear absence makes\nthe heart grow fonder but then\nout of sight, out of mind.\nYou hear about\nradical acceptance,\nbut then what if it's radical\nacceptance of non acceptance?\nI mean, there are\nsome experiences\nin people for which I radically\naccept the fact that I\nwant nothing to do with them.\nAm I supposed to transcend that?\nSo these are the questions I\nthink that keep a lot of people\nfrom exploring things like\nmeditation because they\nfeel like, well, is the idea\nto just be OK with everything?\nIs radical acceptance\njust like--\nwe'll just bulldoze me\nwith things even if they--\nand my goal is to\nsomehow surpass\nthe idea that they're harmful.\nAnd I don't think\nthat's actually\nthe way any of this stuff\nis supposed to work,\nalthough I don't claim to be\nthe authority on it either.\nI think notions of\nradical acceptance,\nand radical honesty, and any\nnumber of different sayings\nthat one can find out there are\nreally the most salient beacons\nand guides that most people have\nin order to try and navigate\ntough areas in their\nlife, including\nthe relationship\nto self, but others\nand political orientations.\nAnd so I feel like\nalmost all those things\ncan be used to anchor down in\na stance that may or may not\nbe informed or to\nopen up to ideas.\nAnd so I think that\nnone of this can really\nbe solved in a single\npractice it sounds like,\nbut it does seem to me, based\non what you've told us today,\nis that only through a deep\nunderstanding of the self\nas it really is, as\nopposed to this illusion\nthat you framed up,\ncould we actually\narrive at some\nanswers about what's\nactually right for each\nand every one of us.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah,\nI mean, there's\none generic answer that\nI think can be extracted\nboth from psychedelics\nand from meditation\nand from just\nthinking more clearly\nabout the nature of our lives.\nAnd it's to become\nmore process oriented,\nand to be more and more\nsensitive to the mirage\nlike character of\nachieving our goals.\nNow, I'm not against\nachieving goals.\nI have a lot of goals.\nI'm very busy.\nThere are lots of things\nI want to get done,\nand I'm satisfied as\nanyone to finish a project.\nBut if you look at\nthe time course of all\nof that fulfillment and--\nthere are a few lessons\neveryone I think has to draw.\nOne is, most of your life\nis spent in the process.\nThe moment at which the goal is\nfully conquered, that is just--\nI mean, that has\na tiny duration,\nand it has a very\nshort half life.\nThe moment you arrive\nat it, it begins\nto recede because,\nin the meantime,\nyou have all these\nother goals that\nhave appeared on the horizon.\nYou've got people asking\nwhat you're going to do next,\nand in some sense, if\nyou're focused on goals,\nyou can never arrive.\nAnd I think what we're\nall looking for in life,\nwhether we're ever\nthinking about taking\npsychedelics or practicing\nsomething like meditation,\nwe're looking for\ngood enough reasons\nto let our attention\nfully rest in the present.\nThat is the logic of success.\nThe sense like, I've got all\nthese things I want to do--\nif I could just get rich\nenough, or fit enough,\nor dial in my sleep well enough,\nor improve my life in all\nof these ways, get the\nright relationship,\nwouldn't it be\ngreat to be married,\nI want to start a family,\nI want all of these things.\nWhy do I want these things?\nI want these things because\nI'm telling myself--\nall of those things\nare wonderful,\nI'm not I'm not discounting\nthose relative forms\nof happiness or\nsources of happiness\nbecause it's all\ncompletely valid,\nit's completely valid\nto want those things.\nBut one thing is\nabsolutely clear,\nit's possible to be miserable\nin the presence of all\nof those things.\nAnd you can add great wealth,\nand fame, and everything\non top of that, and It's\npossible to be absolutely\nmiserable having everything\nanyone could seemingly want.\nYou just have to\nopen a newspaper just\nto see people living\nout that predicament--\nspectacularly wealthy, famous,\nhealthy, successful people\nwho could do anything they\nwant in life, apparently,\nand yet they're\ndoing this thing that\nis completely dysfunctional\nand making them needlessly\nmiserable.\nI won't name names,\nANDREW HUBERMAN: There's\nenough of them out there.\nSAM HARRIS: Some people\ncome to mind at the moment.\nSo there is a clear dissociation\nbetween having everything\nand happiness that's possible.\nAnd it's also possible to\nhave very little, and almost\nnothing, and to be quite happy.\nI mean, you might not\nhave met these people,\nbut I have met people who have\nspent 10 years alone in a cave.\nAnd they come out of\nthat cave not floridly\nneurotic or psychotic,\nthey come out\nof that cave beaming\nwith compassion and joy.\nAnd I mean, they've been taking\nMDMA for 10 years, essentially,\nand they come out\nof the cave and now\nthey're going to talk about it.\nAnd I'm not necessarily\nrecommending that project\nto anyone.\nI'm just saying, that is a\npsychological possibility.\nSo you have a double\ndissociation here,\nwhether you can have\neverything and be miserable,\nor you can have nothing and\nbe beaming with happiness.\nSo what is it that we actually\nwant in all of our seeking\nto arrange the\nprops in our lives\nand to have a\nconvincing enough story\nto tell about ourselves that\nwe're doing the right thing?\nWhat is all of that\neffort predicated on?\nIt's predicated on this\ndesire and this expectation\nthat if we could get all of\nthis stuff in the right place\nand not have anything\nterrifying to worry about,\neveryone we love is healthy for\nthe moment, and we're healthy,\nand we've got something to\nlook forward to on the weekend,\nand there's not a\nplumbing leak in the house\nthat we have to\nimmediately respond to,\nand we like our house, and\nour career is going fine,\nand there's something\ngood to watch on Netflix,\nand we have all of it, now\ncan we just actually give\nup the war?\nCan we fully locate\nour sense of wellbeing\nin the present moment?\nCan we relax the impulse\nto brood about the past\nor think anxiously about\nthe future for long enough\nto discover that all\nof this here is enough?\nBecause our life our life is--\nwe have this finite\nresource of--\nI mean, we absolutely have\nthe finite resource of time,\nbut within this the\nfinite continuum of time,\nwe have the even more\nprecious resource\nof free attention that can find\nour fulfillment in the present.\nBecause even if we're even\nif we're guarding our time\nto do the things that\nare most important to us,\nwe can spend all of that\ntime regretting the past,\nor anxiously\nexpecting the future,\nand just bouncing\nbetween past and future\nin our thinking about\nourselves and our lives,\nand basically just\ndancing over the present\nand never making\ncontact with it.\nSo I think what we want\nis a circumstance where\na tension can be located in the\npresent in a way that's truly\nfulfilling.\nAnd unless you have had\nsome kind of radical insight\nthat allows you to\ndo that on demand,\nyou are in some sense hostage to\nthe circumstances of your life\nto do that for you.\nYou're constantly\ntrying to engineer\na state of the world\nthat will propagate back\non a state of self\nthat will make\nthe present moment good enough.\nAnd what meditation does, and\npsychedelics to some degree\ndoes this, but meditation\nvery directly does this,\nit reverses the causality\nand lets you actually\nchange state such that\nyou can be fulfilled\nbefore anything happens.\nYour happiness is\nno longer predicated\non the next good\nthing happening.\nYou can be in the presence\nof the next good or bad thing\nalready being fulfilled\nand already being at peace.\nI mean, there's a--\nI think there are\nmisleading nouns\nwe can throw at\nwhat is left there,\nbut it is tranquility, peace,\nfreedom, lack of contraction,\nlack of conflict.\nI mean, all of that can be\nmore and more of a default.\nAnd all of that is also\ncompatible with deciding, yeah,\nwhy not get in shape?\nWhy not engage this project?\nWhy not change your career?\nI mean, it's not it's not that\nyou need to be somebody who--\nI mean, to your\npoint, you can notice\nall of these non optimal\nthings because no matter\nhow much you meditate,\nyou're very likely going\nto spend a lot of your time\nstill lost in thought, still\nidentified with it,\nand still caring\nabout the difference between\ndysfunction and normativity\nin your life.\nThe question is, what can you\nwhat can you locate when--\nthe question, it's\nlike, how much can you\npuncture that seeking happiness\nproject with the recognition\nthat you're already free?\nThat's what meditation\nmakes possible.\nYou can keep just\n1,000 times a day\nletting some daylight\ninto this search space.\nBut it is still compatible.\nI mean, working out\nis a great frame\nin which to look at\nthis because, I mean,\nin working out, when\nyou really work out--\nI'm thinking mostly of--\nI mean, it's really\nanything, but it's\nresistance training, or cardio,\nor something like jujitsu.\nYou're intentionally\nputting yourself\nin classically unpleasant\ncircumstances, physiologically.\nI mean, imagine what it's like\nto do anything to failure.\nWell, if you just\ncheck in on what\nthat is like at the level\nof sensation, I mean,\nthat is basically-- it feels\nlike a medical emergency.\nIf you were having\nthat experience\nfor some other reason,\nlike if you woke up\nin the middle of\nthe night and felt\nwhat it feels like\nto be deadlifting\non your 10th rep on a set\nwhere you would fail at 11,\nthat's an emergency.\nBut because you understand\nwhat you're doing in the gym,\nand you've sought\nout, and it's actually\nsomething you like doing, and\nyou can get a real dopamine hit\nfrom doing it, what\nyou're doing when you're\ndoing that is you're owning a--\nyou're actually transforming a\nclassically negative experience\ninto something that's almost\nintrinsically positive,\ncertainly the net\non it is positive.\nBeing able to do\nthat is more and more\nthe experience of being\nactually at peace,\neven while exerting\nreally intense effort\nin one direction.\nSo you can be straining, and\nI'm sure physiologically showing\na lot of stress, I mean,\nI'm sure the cortisol is up,\nand blood pressure's up,\nheart rate is certainly up.\nSo it's like, as far as the\nbody is concerned, it's stress\nas far as the eye can see.\nBut you really can\nbe deeply equanimous\nand at peace, again, because\nof the frame around it,\nbecause of the concepts\nattached to it,\nbecause you know\nwhat you're doing,\nyou know why it's\nhappening, and you want it.\nSo that's an attitude\nyou can bring\ninto other stressful things\nthat take effort to accomplish.\nAnd so it's not\nthat you just need\nto be a pushover when you\nlearn how to meditate,\nor when you take MDMA, or\nwork on yourself in any\nof these ways.\nBut what I think\nyou want to find\nis you want to find\nyour point of rest\nin the midst of any struggle.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I would\nsay that, certainly\nMDMA but, and again, I have\nless experience with meditation,\nbut they really I think\nput us, ultimately,\nin positions of what can only\nrefer to as real strength.\nThese can make\nwhat before seemed\nlike impossible\ndecisions, or even\nconcepts or emotional\nstates to even think\nabout for any period of\ntime without deliberately\ndistracting or avoiding\nin some other way\nand be able to lean into\nthose with open eyes.\nTo me that's my\ndefinition of strength.\nI don't know what\nother people consider.\nBut there's definitely something\nreal there in each case.\nThis may seem like a divergence\nbut I and many other people\nare very curious about a\nrecent decision that you made,\nwhich was to close your\naccount on Twitter.\nYou still have an Instagram\naccount I noticed.\nSAM HARRIS: I mean,\nmy team manages that.\nI've never--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a lot\nfriendlier over at Instagram.\nI've been there a lot longer--\nSAM HARRIS: I've\nnever even seen it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, it's\npretty good actually,\nconsidering-- imagine\nwhat would happen\nif you did pay attention.\nThey're doing a\ngood job with it.\nBut your decision to close\nyour account on Twitter I think\ngrabbed a lot of eyes\nand ears, and there's\na lot of questions about why.\nIt was a very large account.\nIt correlated with a number of\nthings that, for the outsider,\npeople might be wondering\nabout new leadership, people\nwho had been booted off, brought\nback on, or at least invited\nback on, and so on.\nYou are certainly not obligated\nto explain your behavior\nto me or anybody\nelse for that matter.\nBut I'm curious if you\nmight share with us\nwhat the motivation was for\ntaking the account down,\nand how you feel\nin the absence of--\nI mean, your thumbs\npresumably are freed up\nto do other things.\nSAM HARRIS: Yeah, I was\ngetting like an arthritic right\nthumb I think, and I think it--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If\nyou don't mind sharing,\nI think there's a\nlot of curiosity\nabout you and your routines.\nYou've been very generous\nin sharing your knowledge,\nbut also what makes\nyou tick, what\nmotivates pretty big\ndecisions like that?\nIt was a major platform for you.\nSAM HARRIS: Right, yeah, so\nit was the only social media\nplatform I've ever engaged.\nI mean, like you said,\nI have an Instagram,\nI have a Facebook\naccount, but I've never\nused those as platforms.\nI was never on them, I've\nnever followed people.\nAll the posting has\njust come from--\nit's just marketing\nfrom my team.\nBut Twitter was me, I\nmean, for better or worse,\nand I began to feel\nmore and more for worse.\nAnd it was interesting\nbecause it was very--\nI've talked about it\na lot of my podcast,\nabout my love/hate relationship\nwith Twitter over the years.\nMany good things came\nto me from Twitter,\nand I was following a\nlot of smart people.\nAnd it had become my newsfeed\nand my first point of contact\nwith information each day.\nAnd I was really attached to it\njust for that reason, just as\na consumer of content.\nAnd then it was also a\nplace where I genuinely\nwanted to communicate with\npeople and react to things.\nAnd I would see some article\nthat I thought was great,\nand I would signal boost\nit to the people following\nme on Twitter.\nAnd that was rewarding,\nand I could literally\nhelp people on Twitter.\nI mean, there are people who\nhave raised lots of money\nfor on Twitter just by signal\nboosting their GoFundMe's.\nAnd so I was engaged in a\nway that seemed productive.\nBut I was always worried that it\nwas producing needless conflict\nfor me and was giving\nme a signal in my life\nthat I was being lured into\nresponding to and taking\nseriously that was\nout of proportion\nto its representation of any\nopinion or set of opinions\nthat I should be\ntaking seriously.\nSo I was noticing that--\nand again, this\nevolved over years,\nI mean, this long predated\nrecent changes to Twitter,\nbut I was noticing that many\nof the worst things that\nhad happened for\nme professionally\nwere first born on Twitter.\nI mean, just like some conflict\nI got into with somebody,\nor something that I felt like\nI needed to podcast about\nin response to on Twitter.\nJust so much of it, either\nit's genesis was Twitter,\nor it's the further spin of it\nthat became truly unpleasant\nand dysfunctional\nhappened on Twitter.\nIt was just-- Twitter was\npart of the story when\nit got really bad.\nAnd I've had vacations\nthat have gone sideways\njust because I got on\nTwitter and said something,\nand then I had\nproduced a controversy\nthat I had to\nrespond to, and then\nI had to do a\npodcast about that.\nAnd it was just, this is a mess.\nAnd so at that\npoint, I have friends\nwho also had big\nTwitter platforms who\nwould say why are you responding\nto anything on Twitter?\nJust tweet and ghost.\nJoe Rogan--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, post and ghost.\nSAM HARRIS: sat me down and\ntried to give me a talking\nto, as did Bill Maher.\nAnd both of them engage\nTwitter in that way.\nI mean, I think they\nbasically never look\nat their ad mentions.\nThey never see whats\ncoming back at them.\nThey use it effectively, the\nway I use, or don't even, use\nInstagram or Facebook.\nI mean, I don't even see what's\ngoing out there in my name.\nAnd so I could essentially\ndo that for myself\non Twitter, presumably.\nAnd I did that for\nsome periods of time,\nbut then I would\ncontinually decide, OK,\nnow it's all balanced\nagain, maybe I\ncan just communicate here\nbecause it was very tempting\nfor me to communicate\nwith people\nbecause I would see\nsomebody clearly\nmisunderstanding something\nI had said on my podcast,\nand I think, why not clarify\nthis misunderstanding?\nAnd my efforts to do that\nalmost invariably produced a--\nsometimes it was a meandering\nprocess of discovery.\nBut often, it was just\na stark confrontation\nwith what appeared to me to\nbe just lunacy and malevolence\non a scale that I'd never\nencounter elsewhere in my life.\nI'd never meet these\npeople in life,\nand yet I was meeting these\npeople by the tens of thousands\non Twitter.\nAnd so the thing that began\nto worry me about it--\nand again, I\nunderstand that people\nhave the opposite experience.\nI mean, depending on\nwhat you're putting out\nand the kinds of\ntopics you're touching,\nyou could have just\nnothing but love\ncoming back at you on Twitter.\nBut because I am very--\nessentially, in the\ncenter, politically,\nand because this is\nnow on my podcast,\nthis is not in\nthe Waking Up app.\nI'm often criticizing\nthe far left\nand criticizing the far right.\nI'm basically pissing off\neveryone some of the time.\nIt's different, if you're\nonly criticizing the left,\nno doubt you get\nhate from the left,\nbut you have all the people on\nthe right who just reflexively\nand tribally are expressing\ntheir solidarity for you,\nand who are dunking on\nyour enemies for you\nand when your enemies\ncome out of the woodwork.\nAnd if you're only\ncriticizing the right,\nyou get a lot of\npain from the right,\nbut you've got the people\non the left who are tribally\nidentified with the\nleft, who are just going\nto reflexively defend you.\nIf you're in the center\ncriticizing the left as hard\nas anyone on the right\never criticizes the left,\nand you're also criticizing\nthe right as hard\nas anyone on the left\ncriticizes the right,\nyou're getting hate from\nboth sides all the time,\nand no one is\nreflexively and tribally\ndefending you because you\npissed them off last time.\nYou might be getting\nhate from the left now,\nand the people on the\nright agree with you\nbut they can't forget the\nthing you said about Trump\non that podcast\ntwo podcasts ago,\nso they're not\ngoing to defend you.\nAnd so I basically\ncreated hell for myself\non Twitter because it\nwas just a theater of--\nit was just pure cacophony\nmost of the time.\nAnd what I was seeing was--\nI mean, there's no way\nthere's this many psychopaths\nin the world, but I was\nseeing psychopaths everywhere.\nI was seeing the most\nmalicious dishonesty, and just\ngoalpost moving, and hypocrisy.\nI mean, some of it's\ntrolling, and some\nof it's real confusion, and\nsome of it is psychopathy,\nbut it's like, it was\nso dark that I worried\nthat it was actually giving me\na very negative and sticky view\nof humanity that was--\nI mean, one, I think it\nis inaccurate, but two,\nit was something that I\nwas returning to so much\nbecause, again, I was checking\nTwitter at least a dozen times\na day, and I'm sure there were\nsome days where I checked it\n100 times a day.\nI mean, it was, again, it was\nmy main source of information.\nI was constantly reading\narticles and then\nputting my own stuff out.\nThat it became this\nkind of fun house\nmirror in which I was looking\nat the most grotesque side\nof humanity and\nfeeling implicated\nin ways that were\nimportant because it\nwas reputationally important,\nor seem to be important.\nI know a lot of these people.\nThese weren't just\nfaceless trolls,\nthese are people with whom\nI have had relationships\nand in some cases\nfriendships, who\nbecause of what, largely,\nTrump and COVID did\nto our political landscape in\nthe last half a dozen years,\nwe're beginning to\nact in ways that\nseemed starkly dishonest\nand crazy making to me.\nSo I was just noticing that I\nwas forming a view of people\nwho I actually have had\ndinner with that was\nway more negative, based\non their Twitter behavior,\nthen I think would ever be\njustified by any way they would\nbehave in life with me.\nI mean, I was never going to\nhave a face-to-face encounter\nwith any of these\npeople that was\nthis malicious, and\ndishonest, and gaslighting,\nand weird as what was\nhappening hourly on Twitter.\nAnd so I just began\nto become more\nsensitive to what this was--\njust the residue of\nall of this in my life,\nand just how often the\nworst thing about me\nin my relationship with\nthe people in my life,\nlike just talking to\nmy wife or my kids,\nwas just the fact that I had\nbeen on Twitter at some point\nin the previous hour.\nAnd there was some\nresidue of that\nin my interaction with them.\nIt's like, what are\nyou stressed out about?\nWhat are you annoyed about?\nWhat are you pissed off about?\nWhat can't you get\nout of your head?\nWhat is the thing\nthat you now feel\nlike you need to spend\nthe next week of your life\nfocused on because it\nwent so sideways for you?\nAll of that was Twitter.\nI mean, literally 100%\nof that was Twitter.\nAnd so I just, at one point,\nit was actually on Thanksgiving\nday, I just looked\nat this and I just--\nI mean, there was very\nlittle thought went into it.\nI mean, literally,\nthere was more\nthought involved in whether I\nwanted coffee when you asked me\nwhen I showed up here.\nI mean it was just like,\nat a certain point I just I\njust saw it, and I just\nripped the Band-Aid off.\nAnd to answer your\nother question,\nit's been almost\nwholly positive,\nas you might expect given the\nlitany of pain and discomfort\nI just ran through.\nBut I mean, it's\nsurprising to recognize\nhow much of a presence\nit was in my life\ngiven the sense of\nwhat is now missing.\nI mean, there's no\nquestion there's\nan addictive component to it.\nAnd when you see--\nI mean, like when\nI look at what Elon\nis doing on Twitter, forget\nabout his ownership of it--\nI've got a lot to\nsay about the choices\nhe's making for the platform,\nbut just his personal use of it\nis just so obviously\nan expression of--\nI mean, I don't\nknow if addiction\nis the clinically\nappropriate term,\nbut his dysfunctional attachment\nto using the platform.\nAgain, forget about changing\nit and owning it, but just\nthe degree to which it\nis pointlessly disrupting\nthe life of one of the\nmost productive people\nin any generation.\nThat was also instructive\nto me because I know Elon,\nand from a friend's eye\nview of the situation,\nit's so obviously\nnot good for him\nthat he's spending this\nmuch time on Twitter.\nI just brought that back to me.\nIt's like, well, if\nit's not-- if this\nis what it's doing\nto Elon, and he's\ngot all these other\nthings he could\nbe doing with his attention,\nhow much of my use of Twitter\nis actually a good idea and\noptimize to my well-being\nand the well-being of\nthe people around me?\nSo anyway, there was an\naddictive component to it I\nthink, and so when\nthat got stripped off,\nI do notice that there's--\nI mean, there are times\nI pick up my phone\nand I realize this is\nlike the old me picking it\nup my phone for a reason that\nno longer exists because there's\nnot that much--\nI have a Slack\nchannel with my team,\nand I've got email,\nobviously, but it's\nlike, that is not much of\nwhat I was doing with my phone\nreally in the end.\nAnd so it's just my\nphone is much less\nof a presence in my life.\nAnd so it's almost\nwholly good, but yeah,\nI think there is\nsome danger in--\nor some possible\ndanger in losing touch\nwith certain aspects of\nculture, which, again, I'm\nnot even sure--\nI mean, there's this question of\nhow much is Twitter real life,\nand how much is it\njust a mass delusion?\nI don't know.\nBut insofar as it\nactually matters\nwhat happens on\nTwitter, or insofar\nas I was actually getting\na news diet which I'm not\ngoing to be able to\nrecapitulate for myself,\nor I'm just not in fact going\nto recapitulate for myself even\nif I could, if any\nof that matters,\nI haven't discovered that yet.\nI mean, it was taking up an\nimmense amount of bandwidth\nand it's impressive.\nI think I said, it was like\nI amputated a phantom limb.\nIt was not a real limb, but it\nwas this continuous presence\nin my life that--\nit's weird, it actually\nrelates to the concept\nof self in surprising\nways because I\nfelt there was a part of\nmyself that existed on Twitter.\nAnd I just performed a\nsuicide of that self.\nThis is ending right\nnow, there's no residue,\nthere's nothing to go\nback and check, it's gone.\nAnd I didn't go back\nand look at my--\nwhat's interesting to\nconsider is that I'd\nbeen on Twitter for 12 years.\nI don't keep a journal.\nI mean, Twitter, in\nmy timeline would\nhave been a kind of journal.\nI could have gone back\nto a specific hour\nand a specific day and looked at\nwhat I was paying attention to.\nI mean, that could have\nbeen an interesting record\nof just who I've\nbeen for a decade,\nand probably a pretty\nhumbling record of who I've\nbeen for a decade in terms\nof the kinds of things\nthat captivated my attention.\nI didn't even think to\ngo nostalgically just\nlook at any of that,\nor see if any of it\nwas worth saving, or\narchiving, or thinking--\nI just-- delete.\nAnd so my actual sense of\nwho I am and my engagement\nwith my audience, the world of\npeople who could potentially\nknow me.\nWhat does it mean\nto have a platform?\nWhere do I exist, digitally?\nMy sense of all of\nthat got truncated\nin a way that is\nmuch less noisy.\nI mean, it's amazing\nhow much can't\nget fucked up now in my life.\nIt's like with Twitter,\nalmost anything could happen.\nThe next tweet was\nalways an opportunity\nto massively complicate my life.\nThere is no analogous\nspace for me now.\nAnd so it's what I'm going\nto say on your podcast, what\nI'm going to say on\nmy own podcast, what\nI'm going to write next.\nThat's much more deliberative\nand the opportunities\nto take my foot out of my mouth\nor to reconsider whether any\nof this is worth it.\nIs this the Hill I really\nwant to die on now.\nIt can be much more considered.\nI mean, I think all\nof that's to the good.\nBut even more important\nthan that is there's not--\nI'm not getting this\ncontinuous signal\nthat is always\ninviting a response,\nwhether on Twitter, or on my\nown podcast, or anywhere else.\nAnd it's just much less noisy.\nI mean, life is much\nless noisy and cluttered.\nAnd that definitely\nfeels better.\nThat's 100% better.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nhappy to hear that.\nI know a number of people miss\nyou there, but you sound happy.\nI sense the genuine happiness.\nAnd several things\ncome to mind--\nfirst of all, thank you for\nsharing your rationale there\nand how it went.\nI think for a lot of\npeople they think,\noh, you must have walked\naround in circles for hours\ntalking about whether\nit was delete,\nas many good decisions\nare executed.\nI'm a big fan of Cal\nNewport's work, deep work.\nIn many ways, Cal's--\nI've never met him,\nbut we know each other\nthrough the internet space.\nHe's really ahead of his time\nwith this notion of deep work\nand limiting distractions.\nI think he's even got\na book about a world\nwithout email or\nsomething, really extreme.\nSAM HARRIS: So I mean,\nhe deserves some credit\nbecause he had been somewhat\na proximate cause to this.\nHe had been on my\npodcast, and he\nhad encouraged me\nto delete Twitter\nbecause I had been I had been\nreaching some kind of crisis\npoint with it prior\nto that podcast\nand so we talked about it.\nAnd I had recorded that\npodcast but hadn't released it.\nI actually recorded\nthe podcast the day\nbefore I wound up\ndeleting Twitter,\nbut I hadn't yet released it.\nSo in my podcast with\nhim, in the intro to it,\nI then give a post-mortem\non my deleting it.\nBut he was one of the\nlast people who was\nin my head around these issues.\nAnd actually, it\nwas not by accident\nI had invited him on the\npodcast because I increasingly\nwanted to think about whether\nthis was totally dysfunctional.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm\na big fan of Cal Newport.\nAnd I am on social media.\nI'm on Twitter.\nI had some high-friction\ninteractions there,\nand I have a process\nfor dealing with those.\nI tend to avoid high-friction\nconfrontations online.\nBut Instagram is a much\nfriendlier place by the way.\nIf you want to come over\nto where the nice kids--\nthe cool kids\nactually hang out--\nSAM HARRIS: Strangely, I'm\nnot looking for a substitute.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Don't let\nme entice you over there.\nBut I think that\nthis notion of really\nbeing able to access what\nCal calls deep work, what\nRick Rubin talks about\nbeing able to touch\nthe source of great creativity\nand focus on a regular basis,\ndoes require that one\nhave certain types of,\nand in some cases,\nzero interaction\nwith certain platforms.\nThat merely being on a\nplatform and blocking\npeople that just won't provide.\nI think a lot of\nenergy opens up.\nAnd I'm fascinated by\nthis concept of energy.\nI mean, we only\nhave so much energy,\nneural energy, to devote.\nAnd in many ways\nwhat you described,\nthere's really I think\nstriking parallels\nto what we've been talking about\nall along these last hours,\nwhich is that sometimes\nthe thing that\nfeels so powerful, that has\nsuch a gravitational pull,\nand that we think this is\nexperience, this is life,\nthis is just the way it is,\nactually is an illusion.\nAnd when you step\naway from it, you\nrealize that there's this whole\nother dimension of interactions\nthat was available all along but\nthat we, for whatever reason,\nwere intervening in by way\nof our reflexive, distracted\nbehavior.\nSo I think there's\na poetry there.\nSAM HARRIS: I was a\nhard case, but yeah, I\ngot religion on this point,\nand it's a good change.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, Sam, I want\nto say a couple of things--\nfirst of all, every time\nyou talk I learn\nso much, and that's\nin the dimensions of\nneuroscience, even\nhard core neural circuitry\ntype stuff, which is my home.\nWhen you talk about philosophy,\nor meditation, or psychedelics,\nand even politics, a topic that\nI'm woefully undereducated in,\nbut you have this amazing\nability to blend and synergize\nacross things.\nAnd I think, today,\nwhat occurs to me\nis that not only\nis that no accident\nbecause of your\ntraining, and the rigor,\nand the depth at\nwhich you've explored\nthese different topics, but\nalso your openness to it.\nBut I think, at least\nfor me, above all\nit's because I think you\nare able to encapsulate\nthis idea of the self\nand the different ways\nin which we each and\nall can potentially\ninteract with the environment\nand our inner landscape.\nYour description of\nmeditation, I have to say,\nnow has forever changed the\nway I think about meditation.\nI would no longer just think\nof it as a perceptual exercise.\nOn the podcast, I've\nbeen talking about it\nas something to do for these\nvarious benefits, the benefit\nset of more focus, lower stress,\nof which certainly exists.\nBut what you describe\ntoday, has such an allure\nand holds such a promise\nthat, as I mentioned,\nI'm certainly going\nto change my behavior.\nAnd I know I'm\nspeaking on behalf\nof many, many\npeople, when I just\nwant to extend my thanks\nfor your coming here today\nto teach us even more\nbecause, of course, you\nhave your podcast and the\napp, the Waking Up app.\nAnd the fact that, regardless\nof the political landscapes,\nregardless of what neuroscience\nfeels about psychedelics,\nor where things are\nat any point in time,\nyou strike me as somebody who\nis very committed to sharing\nknowledge and thoughtful\ndeep discourse\nso that people can benefit.\nAnd there are very\nfew people like you.\nIn fact, there's\nprobably only just one.\nAnd so I feel very\ngrateful to be\nsitting across the table from\nhim for these last hours.\nSAM HARRIS: Oh, nice, nice.\nWell, I really\nenjoyed this, and I\nwant to congratulate\nyou on what you've\nbuilt here because your podcast\nis everywhere, and I'm a fan.\nAnd even more than\nthat, I'm continually\nseeing the evidence of you\nreaching people and benefiting\npeople, and this is one of\nthe best examples of new media\njust carving out a space\nthat people didn't really\nknow existed because this is\nnot television, it's not radio,\nit's not--\nand all of a sudden,\npeople have time\nto hear a conversation\nof great length\nthat goes into nitty gritty\nscientific detail on hormones.\nI mean, who would have thought\nthat was even possible?\nAnd so, yeah, I would\njust-- congratulations,\nit's fantastic to see.\nAnd I'm just very happy\nfor the opportunity\nto talk to you and your people.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, thank you,\nit's very gratifying to hear.\nAnd I feel very blessed,\nin no small part because\nof our conversation today.\nThank you so much.\nSAM HARRIS: Nice,\nwell, to be continued.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nTo be continued.\nWe'll do it again,\nand again, and again.\nThank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion
