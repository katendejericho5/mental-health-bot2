    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest\nis Jocko Willink.\nJocko Willink is a\nretired Navy SEAL\nand author of numerous important\nbooks on leadership and team\ndynamics and the host\nof the Jocko Podcast.\nDuring his 20-year\ncareer with the US Navy,\nJocko served with SEAL\nTeam 3 as commander\nof Task Unit Bruiser\nin Ramadi, Iraq,\nand elsewhere in\nthe Middle East,\nas well as deployments\nin Asia and Europe.\nAfter retiring from\nthe Navy, Jocko\nused his experience\nand knowledge\ngleaned from his time in\nthe SEAL teams as a way\nto develop tools\nthat anybody can\nuse to develop their\nleadership skills,\nboth for leading themselves\nand for leading others.\nThat took the form of\nseveral important books,\nthe first of which\nwas published in 2015\nand is entitled\nExtreme Ownership:\nHow US Navy Seals Lead and Win.\nHe has also authored\nseveral books\nfor kids about leadership,\npersonal development\nand how to navigate\nvarious aspects of life.\nI've read both Extreme Ownership\nand The Way of the Warrior Kid,\nand I found them to\nbe immensely useful\nin terms of actionable\ninformation and understanding\nof oneself and different\nkinds of relationships,\nboth in and out\nof the workplace.\nTypically, guests on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nare scientists\nand/or clinicians.\nIt was some time ago that I was\na guest on the Jocko Podcast.\nAnd during the course of our\nconversation on his podcast,\nwe quickly realized that many\nof the science-based tools\nthat my laboratory\nhas focused on\nand that I've used\nover the years\nand shared on the\nHuberman Lab Podcast\nhad direct overlap\nand parallel with many\nof the tools that Jocko and\nother members of the SEAL teams\nhad arrived at\nindependently-- that is,\nwithout knowledge of\nthe underlying science.\nAnd in fact, he\nhad many more tools\nthat he had incorporated during\nhis years in the SEAL teams\nas well as in\nbusiness leadership,\nin family and elsewhere\nin life, that I quickly\nrealized it would\nbe an enormously\nvaluable conversation to\nhave him on this podcast\nin order to share those tools\nwith the general public.\nDuring today's episode,\nwe discuss numerous tools\nthat Jocko has taught and used\nover the years in a number\nof different contexts,\nincluding tools for generating\nmore physical energy and\nfor generating more focus\nand cognitive energy.\nAnd for navigating\nsticking points,\nthat is how to deal\nwith lack of motivation,\nhow to deal with\ndifficult relationships\nin the workplace and elsewhere.\nAnd perhaps most\nimportantly, how\nto think about and\nnavigate the self.\nIn fact, we spend\nquite a bit of time\ntalking about this notion of\nthe self and one's self identity\nand how self identity\nplays into our ability\nto engage in actions of specific\ntypes consistently over time,\nwhere it can hold us back,\nhow to gain better perspective\nand how to help others\ngain better perspective so\nthat we can work better\nwith them and them with us.\nWe also go deep into the\nlikely scientific mechanisms\nunderlying why the tools\nthat Jocko teaches and uses\nare so effective.\nIn fact, one thing that\nyou'll immediately notice\nis that Jocko was\nwriting things down\nand I was writing things down\nthroughout the conversation.\nAnd that just reflects the\nfact that he's not just\nan immensely powerful\nteacher, he's\nalso a practitioner\nand an avid learner.\nHe's always seeking knowledge.\nSo we kick back\nand forth our ideas\nabout what likely does and does\nnot underlie different tools\nand techniques, focusing,\nof course, mostly\non what works in the\npractical sense in the world.\nWhat I can assure you is that\nby the end of today's episode,\nthanks to Jocko's immense\ngenerosity and curiosity,\nyou will come away with\na large number of tools\nand much richer understanding\nof how to navigate and enhance\nmental health, physical\nhealth and performance\nin all aspects of life.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Maui Nui.\nMaui Nui he is venison\nthat is by far the most\nnutrient-dense and delicious\nred meat commercially available.\nMaui Nui he spent\nnearly a decade\nbuilding a USDA-certified\nwild harvesting system\nto help balance invasive\ndeer populations\non the island of Maui.\nThe solution they built\nturns the proliferation\nof an otherwise invasive\nspecies into a wide range\nof nutrient-dense products, from\nfresh butcher cuts and organ\nmeats to bone broth,\njerky, and even pet treats.\nThe quality and nutrient\nvalue of Maui Nui meats\nis extraordinary.\nFor instance, their bone broth\nhas an unmatched 25 grams\nof protein per 100 calories.\nAs I've talked about with\nguests and in solo episodes\nof this podcast, getting\nadequate protein intake,\nand in particular,\nhigh-quality protein intake,\nis extremely important.\nCurrent research\nsuggests that most people\nshould be getting\nabout 1 gram per pound\nof body weight of\nquality protein per day.\nAnd Maui Nui meats are of\nthe absolute highest quality\nin terms of the amino acid\nprofile and other nutrients\ncontained in their venison.\nIf you would like to\ntry Maui Nui venison,\ngo to\nmauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's\nmauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've discussed many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout the key importance\nof temperature\nin regulating the\nquality of your sleep.\nPut simply, in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep\nthroughout the night,\nyour body temperature\nhas to drop by about\n1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd waking up, conversely,\ninvolves your body temperature\nincreasing by about\n1 to 3 degrees.\nNow, people vary in their\ncore body temperature\nand whether or not they\ntend to run hot or cold\nthroughout the night.\nBut with Eight Sleep\nmattresses and mattress covers,\nyou can literally program\nin the exact temperature\nthat you want to sleep in.\nAnd that allows you\nto fall deeply asleep,\ngo into slow wave\nsleep and REM sleep--\nthat is rapid eye movement\nsleep-- in the exact sequence\nthat you need to in order to\nhave the best quality sleep\nand it will even track\nyour sleep for you.\nI've been sleeping with\nan 8 sleep mattress cover\non my mattress for\nabout eight months now\nand it is incredible.\nMy sleep was already pretty\ngood and now it is fantastic\nand I feel so much\nmore alert and focused.\nMy mood is far better\nthroughout the day.\nI thought I was optimized\nand with Eight Sleep,\nnow I realize I\nhad a lot more room\nto improve my sleep and\nmy daytime wakefulness.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go

Australia.\nAgain, that's\nEightSleep.Com/Huberman to save\n$150 at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means the exact ratios\nof electrolytes are in LMNT,\nand those are sodium,\nmagnesium, and potassium\nbut it has no sugar.\nI've talked many times before on\nthis podcast about the key role\nof hydration and electrolytes\nfor nerve cell function, neuron\nfunction, as well\nas the function\nof all the cells\nand all the tissues\nand organ systems of the body.\nIf we have sodium, magnesium,\nand potassium present\nin the proper ratios, all of\nthose cells function properly\nand all our bodily\nsystems can be optimized.\nIf the electrolytes\nare not present\nand if hydration\nis low, we simply\ncan't think as well as we would\notherwise, our mood is off,\nhormone systems go\noff, our ability\nto get into physical\naction, to engage\nin endurance and strength and\nall sorts of other things,\nis diminished.\nSo with LMNT, you can\nmake sure that you're\nstaying on top of your\nhydration and that you're\ngetting the proper\nratios of electrolytes.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to DrinkLMNT--\nthat's L-M-N-T--\nslash Huberman, and you'll\nget a free LMNT sample\npack with your purchase.\nAnd right now, LMNT\nhas two special flavors\nfor the holidays, chocolate\ncaramel and mint chocolate.\nBy the way, both of those\ntaste extremely good,\ncold and, even better, I find,\nheated up, believe it or not.\nYou can have them as kind\nof a tea, they're delicious.\nAnd all of their\nflavors are delicious.\nFor the ones that you\ndrink typically cold,\nI like the raspberry flavor\nthe watermelon flavor,\nand frankly, I like the\ncitrus flavor as well.\nThey're all delicious.\nSo again, if you want to try\nLMNT, you can go to LMNT,\ndrinklmnt.com/huberman.\nThe Huberman Lab\npodcast is now partnered\nwith Momentous supplements.\nTo find the supplements we\ndiscuss on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, you can go to\nlivemomentous-- spelled O-U-S--\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just\nmention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Jocko Willink.\nJocko Willink, welcome.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Thanks\nfor having me, man.\n- I'm super excited and\nsuper happy to have you here.\n- I'm glad to be here.\nI know that you and I did five\nand 1/2 hours on my podcast.\nSo schedule is clear, let's go.\n- Let's go.\nAnd actually-- and people\nwill see the Jocko GO drinks.\nThis is not some sort\nof promotional by me,\nbut these are the\nenergy drinks I drink.\nSo this could be called the\nbring-your-own-GO podcast.\nIt is the energy drink I drink.\nAnd no, I'm not\ntold to promote that\nor paid to promote that, it's\njust the one that I drink.\nSo there you go.\nNo pun intended.\nI was just saying\nto our producer\na moment ago that rarely\ndo I sit down and do\na podcast with somebody\nthat's skilled in podcasting.\nLex Fridman would\nbe the only person\nthat I've had on this\npodcast, I believe,\nwho's also a podcaster.\nSince you're a podcaster\nand many other things,\nI confess I'm a little\nbit intimidated.\n- Well, it's a weird thing\nto actually call a skill.\nBecause it's something that\nI just kind of started doing.\nIt's something that you\njust kind of started doing.\nIt's something that Lex\njust kind of started doing.\nAnd I never practiced\nit, I didn't\nsit down before my first\npodcast and think about how\nI should deliver things.\nI just kind of did it, so.\nMaybe it's just luck\nmore than skill.\n- Well, you and I\nactually go back further\nthan that conversation that\nwe had on your podcast.\nI think it might\nhave been 2014, 2015,\nand you were on the\nTim Ferriss podcast.\nAnd at the time I was\nliving with my girlfriend,\nwe had moved from San\nDiego to the Bay Area.\nWe were living in this\nlittle, tiny apartment\nin a basement in Oakland,\ntrying to save up to buy a place\nor rent a place that\nwas decent to live in.\nAnd we both knew a\nlot of team guys,\nshe knew more team guys\nthan I did in San Diego.\nHad dated a few,\njust to be direct.\nGreat woman, those guys\nwere cool to me, mostly.\nAnd I remember when I saw\nthe photo on the top card\nfor Tim's podcast.\nIt was your face.\nAnd I said, do you know\nthis guy from San Diego.\nAnd she goes, nope.\nBut if you had to draw a Navy\nSEAL, that's what you'd draw.\nSo I think for a\nlot of people, you\nembody their notion of a\nnumber of different things,\nsome of which you talk about.\nBut some of which,\nwhen you open up a bit\nand really get specific\nabout work in the military\nand work in daily life and what\nit is to be you, but really,\nwhat it is to be a human being,\nsome important contradictions\nalso emerge, right?\nObviously, discipline is a theme\nthat people associate with you,\nright?\nIn my view and I think in\nthe view of a lot of people,\nyou embody discipline.\nSo today, I definitely want\nto talk about routines,\nbut also mindsets.\nBut also things\nthat you do and ways\nthat you approach things that\nmight not contradict, but not\nbe so obvious to people.\nMight be a little\nbit counterintuitive.\nAnd in addition to that, you\nhave a lot of different aspects\nto your life.\nIn addition to\nrunning businesses,\nyou're a family man,\nyou have children\nand married a long time.\nAnd so you have a\nlot of knowledge\nfrom different domains of life.\nSo with your permission, I'd\nlike to dive into all of them\nover the next 26 hours.\n- Let's dive.\n- Great.\nI'm fascinated by this\nidea of sense of self.\nI feel like all of us can look\nback to a time early in life\nwhen we first had\nsome experience.\nCould be in art class,\ncould be fishing,\ncould be sport,\ndoesn't really matter\nwhat the exact experience was.\nBut where we first realized\nthat there are really\ncool things in the world.\nLike something that turned us\non at the level of excitement.\nOr maybe scared us, or\nsomething like that.\nDo you have any recollection\nof such an event?\nMaybe not the first\none, but you ever\nremember hearing or seeing\nsomething as a young kid,\nand maybe you could tell us\nhow young, and just thinking,\nyeah, more of that please.\n[JOCKO CHUCKLES]\n- A lot of times when\npeople ask questions\nalong this line of when\nwas there a moment--\nwhen was there a moment\nthat you realized discipline\nor when was there a moment\nyou realized leadership\nor when was there a moment\nyou realized detachment,\nkind of like your\nquestion, when was there\na moment you realized, for lack\nof a better way of saying it,\nI'm a person.\nI'm a person with\nmy own thoughts\nand I can make things happen.\nAnd for me, all those answers\nare usually fairly gradual.\nThere's a little thing that\nindicates, you get a clue\nand then you move a little\nbit further down that road.\nThen you get another\nclue and then\nyou move a little bit\nfurther down that road\nand you get another clue.\nSo that's what I\nwould say, for me,\nlife was like when\nI was a little kid.\nI was kind of slowly\ndiscovering that I was a person,\nI was a human.\nI remember my mom\ntook me shopping.\nI was probably\nabout 10 years old\nand I needed to get\npants for school.\nAnd my mom took me shopping.\nAnd when I went into the store,\nthere was a girl that was--\nI don't know what they're\ncalled in a store.\nA retail sales girl?\nShe was probably about 16.\nAnd I started chatting her up.\nAnd I kind of recognize\nit a little bit\nbut I sort of didn't too and I\njust was chatting to this girl\nand I was making her laugh.\nAnd I was having a good\ntime with the whole thing\nand putting on the pants\nand spinning around,\nand she was laughing.\nAnd I remember when we left\nthe store with the pants\nand my mom was sort\nof talking to me\nabout the fact that, \"What were\nyou trying to do to that girl?\"\nAnd I was thinking to\nmyself, well, I kind of\nliked that girl, she was pretty.\nAnd I don't know why\nthat popped into my head.\nBut I just remember\nthinking, hey man, there's\na whole world out there and\nlet's go make it happen.\n- Yeah, it's a great story.\nBecause I think it really\nspeaks to this thing\nthat you mentioned, which\nis that when we first\nstart to realize we\nhave a sense of self,\nit has something to do with\ncause and effect on the world,\nlike we can have an impact\nin some way on things outside\nof us, outside of our home.\nLately I've been reading\na lot of psychology\nand I've been listening\nto some of your content\nand I definitely want to\ntalk to you about a study\nthat you covered\nrelated to these--\nit's a brutal experiment with\nthese kids that either had\nstutter or didn't have stutter.\nI want to get into that\na little bit later.\nBut what we do and\nhow we treat people\nand how we receive feedback and\ngive feedback has a big impact.\nBut I think some of that happens\njust in our own relationship\nto things in the world.\nThe older Hungarian\npsychologist, I'm learning,\nhad this idea of\ntwo kinds of people.\nThey literally thought there\nwere two kinds of people.\nThere are generators\nand projectors.\nAnd generators are\npeople that are just--\nfrom a very young\nage, they realize\nthey can impact other people,\npositively, negatively.\nAnd they want to create\nthings in the world,\nthey want to generate stuff.\nAnd they go wow, I can actually\nbuild stuff and break stuff.\nBlow stuff up, maybe,\nbut also help things.\nAnd then there are\nthese projectors\nthat like to just\nreflect on what they see.\nAnd they made the really\nimportant point, I think,\nthat it's not the generators\nare good and projectors are bad.\nThe world needs both,\nthat they really work\nin a kind of symbiotic way.\nBut your story\ncaptures the essence\nof what it is to be\na generator, which\nis that by doing certain\nthings, you can have an impact.\nAnd it feeds back to\nyou and it's likely\nthat they receive\nsomething from it as well.\n- Yeah.\nAnd where this all came to\nfruition, as I now piece\ntogether as you're talking\nthrough this stuff--\nLook, when I joined the\nmilitary, you join the military\nand you get a blank slate.\nSo no one cares\nwhere you came from,\nno one cares what you did.\nYou were the captain\nof the football\nteam, captain of the\nsoccer team, no one cares.\nNo one cares what\nyour grades were,\nno one cares what\nyou got on the SATs.\nNo one cares about anything.\nYou're a blank slate.\nAnd then with that\nblank slate, it is, hey,\nif you do this thing,\nif you perform this task\nand you perform it well,\nyou will get recognition.\nYou will hopefully\nget more control\nover your own destiny, which\nis the ultimate in compensation\nfor human beings.\nTo have more control\nover your own destiny\nis the ultimate compensation.\nYou and I were talking\nbefore we hit record,\nyou can have all the\nmoney in the world,\nbut if you don't\ncontrol what you're\ndoing every day or\nat least you don't\ncontrol most of what you're\ndoing, then it's not worth it.\nThe reason people\ntry and make money\nis so they can have more\nautonomy in their life.\nAnd so in the military,\nit becomes very clear--\nand it became very\nclear to me very quickly\nthat if I performed well, I\nactually got a lot more freedom\nwith what I did.\nEven in boot camp.\nIf you pass an\ninspection in boot camp,\nyou don't have to\nredo your locker\nor you don't have to make your\nbed again because you did it\nright the first time.\nAnd so you have an\nextra 15 minutes.\nAnd so for me,\nreally, that's when\nI started to realize, oh,\nwhat I'm doing right now is it\ngoing to impact not\nonly what's going\nto happen to me\nin the next hour,\nbut in the next two years,\nthree years, five years.\nAnd I think that's the\nbiggest miss that we have\nwhen we're growing up.\nAnd I know you had your\nchallenges and tribulations\nas you were growing up because\nyou didn't realize, oh,\nwhat I'm doing right now\nis going to affect where\nI'm going to be in the future.\nAnd it didn't happen until\nyou were out of high school,\nwhen you went to junior\ncollege and you're like,\noh wait a second, I can\nactually put my life together\nin a positive way.\nWhen you're 14,\nyou're thinking, hey\nwhat am I going to do tomorrow.\nThat's basically\nfuture operations or--\nwhat am I going to do tomorrow.\n- Would've been far\nahead for me at 14.\nI was like, where am I going to\nget the Slurpee, which curves\nam I going to hit\nskateboarding and where are we\ngoing to play\nvideo games tonight\nor what girls are we\ngoing to hang out with.\nThat was kind of\nthe mindset at 14.\n- Yeah.\nAnd then at some point,\nyou learned, and so did I,\noh, the actions that\nI take now are either\ngoing to positively\nimpact my future\nor they're to negatively\nimpact my future.\nAnd the more I focused\non doing things\nthat are going to\npositively impact my future,\nthe better my life became.\nAnd I think that's\na very huge lesson\nto learn that I know I didn't\nfigure out for quite some time.\n- Yeah the idea of\ninvestments and withdrawals,\nor understanding\nthat early in life\nin terms of health behaviors\nand intellectual behaviors.\nAnd your point\nabout the military\nis a really interesting\none, I never\nthought about the\nmilitary that way,\nthat there's this blank\nslate when you get in there.\nAnd before we started, we\nwere talking a little bit\nabout the kinds of\nmindsets and people\nthat the military attracts.\nAnd I'd love for you to\nelaborate on that again.\nYou mentioned\nsomething interesting,\nthis notion of garrison.\n- Interesting word\nin its own right.\nWhat kind of people do you\nthink the military attracts?\nAnd then within the\nmilitary, do you\nstart to see some kind of\npredictable bifurcations, where\ncertain people go down\none track and other people\ngo down another?\nI have a few friends from the\nSEAL teams, as we both know.\nAnd I've heard sometimes\nabout the distinction\nbetween officers and enlisted\nguys, this kind of thing.\nBut maybe this\nquestion I'm asking\nis more across the board\nfor all of military.\nAnd for people\nlistening, whether or not\nthey are interested in military\nor not for their own life,\nI think there's an interesting\nlesson, this idea of who\nis attracted to the military.\nIs it like people who want to\ninstill order on themselves\nor is it people who want to\ninstill order on other people,\nor both?\n- Yeah.\nThere's a really good\nbook and I ended up\ndoing about four podcasts\non this book, which\nis called The Psychology\nof Military Incompetence.\nAnd when I first saw that--\n- What an amazing title.\n- I know.\nAnd when I first saw that\ntitle, I thought to myself,\noh, this is some academic that's\ngoing to look at the military\nand bash it.\nBut I did a little\nresearch and it turned out\nthat the guy that had\nwritten the book--\nI can't think of\nhis name right now--\nhe was a guy that had served\nin World War II, was wounded.\nI mean, this guy understood\nwhat he was talking about.\nAnd it's really\nan obvious concept\nonce you think about it.\nThe basic premise is\nthis, the military,\nwhen you look at it\nfrom the outside,\nit's this orderly place.\nIt's a place where\neverything has a place.\nIt's a place where if you have\na certain rank on your shoulder,\nyou will command respect and\npeople have to listen to you.\nThat's what it looks like.\nSo it's an attractive\nplace for people\nthat have an authoritarian\nmindset, for people that\nwant to just, hey, don't\nquestion what I'm saying,\njust shut up and do\nwhat I tell you to do.\nThere's people that love that.\nThere's people that\nwant to live like that.\nYou've worked for them,\nI've worked for them.\nWe've experienced those type\nof people throughout our lives.\nThat authoritarian\nmindset that just\nwant to bark orders and\nhave people listen to them.\nAnd so when those people are\n14 years old or 16 years old\nor 18 years old, they\nlook at the military\nand they see a uniform.\nAnd they see people\nsaluting and they\nsee orders being carried out.\nAnd they think, that's\nwhere I'm going to go.\nAnd I can get the\nrespect that I deserve.\nAnd the military certainly\nattracts people like that.\nAnd those people that have that\nhighly-disciplined and orderly\nmindset can do well\ninside the military,\nespecially in garrison.\nAgain, we were talking\nabout this earlier, the word\ngarrison.\nI don't think there's a civilian\nequivalent to this word,\nbut it basically means\nthe noncombat situation.\nSo when you're out\non the parade field,\nwhen you're going\nthrough schooling where\nthere's no combat involved,\nwhen you're marching.\nThose kind of things,\nwe call that garrison.\nIt's in the rear.\nIt's not in combat.\nAnd the people with an\nauthoritarian mindset\nactually do pretty well\nin garrison situations.\nWhy?\nBecause things are orderly\nand you can predict what's\ngoing to happen.\nAnd you do get a\ncertain issue of gear\nand that gear is going\nto be delivered on time\nand you're going to shoot\nthis number of rounds\ndown at the range.\nAnd everything is going\nto go according to plan,\nthat's what garrison is.\nAnd so those people\njoin the military,\nthey're attracted to\nthat and they end up\ndoing well in peacetime.\nNow unfortunately for them,\ncombat is a lot different.\nNothing goes the way\nit's supposed to go.\nThe bullets don't get\ndelivered on time,\nthe enemy has a vote on the\nway things are going to unfold.\nAnd you end up in combat being\nin very chaotic situations.\nSo the type of person\nthat thrives in combat\nhas a more open mind,\nhas a more flexible mind,\nis paying more\nattention to the input\nthat they're receiving\nas opposed to someone\nwith an authoritarian mindset.\nThey don't listen\nto anybody else.\nThey make up their own\nmind, they bark orders.\nWith someone that has\na more open mindset,\nthey're listening,\nthey're taking input,\nthey're evolving their plan.\nAnd those type of people\nexcel in a combat situation.\nNow unfortunately, and this is\nsort of the stereotype too, you\ntake that dog of war\nand you put him back\ninto a garrison environment,\nhe doesn't do well.\nHe's not showing up on\ntime for the inspection,\ndidn't get his haircut, he\ndoesn't have his weapon cleaned\nthe way it's supposed to\nbe cleaned because he's\ngot his weapon ready for combat,\nnot ready for inspection.\nAnd so you get this-- there\nare these two different types\nof people.\nAnd of course, with those two\ndifferent types of people,\nthere's degrees going\none direction or other.\nBut what you hope\nfor is someone that\ncan play the game\non the garrison side\nand yet when it comes\ntime to go into combat,\nthey can also open their mind,\nbe flexible, be creative.\nThat's what you really want\nis you want someone that is\nvery good at solving problems.\nAnd to do that, you need to have\na creative, open mind to figure\nout how we're going to\ndeal with something.\nSo I think that's\nthe stereotype.\nThe stereotype is that\neveryone in the military\nis sort of robotic and\nfalling into the hierarchy,\nand we bark orders and\npeople follow orders.\nAnd that's just not true.\nThere is an element\nof truth to it\nbut it's not the whole truth.\nAnd certainly, if you look at\nit history, the people that\nexcel in combat are the\npeople that maybe have\na little bit of a\nrebellious streak,\npeople that are just more\ncreative and more open minded.\n- Some of my friends\nfrom the SEAL teams\nwill sometimes throw\nout stereotypes\nabout the different\ndivisions in the military.\nIs there any truth to this\nidea that Air Force types are\none way and Marines are one\nway and Navy is one way,\narmy is a certain way?\nSort of a general\ncontour of personality\nor is that just kind of\ninside ball, joking around?\n- It's a little bit of both.\nI mean certainly, the Marine\nCorps is steeped in tradition.\nAnd if you make a guess\nat what a marine--\nif you had to guess what a\nmarine is going to be like,\nyou're probably going\nto be pretty close.\nMarines have an\nincredible program\nto indoctrinate their people\ninto the culture of the Marine\nCorps.\nAnd the Marine Corps has an\nincredibly strong culture.\nIt's a powerful culture.\nI love the Marine Corps, I've\nworked with the Marine Corps\na ton and they're outstanding.\nAs a generality, certainly you\ncould make those assumptions\nabout the Marines in general.\nNow, does that mean that\nevery Marine is the same?\nNo, absolutely not.\nSame thing with the army,\nsame thing with the Air Force,\nsame thing with the Navy.\nYou've got these\nkind of stereotypes\nthat exist for a reason.\nIt's interesting too.\nOne of my friends\nnamed Ben Milligan\nwrote an incredible\nbook called By Water\nBeneath the Walls,\nwhich I've given him\na huge hassle about because it's\nthe worst title of all time.\nBut it's certainly\nthe best book written\nabout the SEAL teams'\nhistory and where\nthe SEAL teams came from.\nAnd it's interesting,\nit's something\nthat I had heard from\na SEAL officer that\nhad given a speech years ago\nat his change of command.\nAnd what he said\nwas he was trying\nto emphasize why the\nSEAL teams were good.\nAnd one of the things he\nsaid was in the army--\nand he was talking\nhistorically-- he goes,\nhey, in the army, if you\nstart to lose a battle,\nyou can just retreat\nand run away.\nIn the Navy, traditionally,\nwe're fighting on board a ship.\nAnd if that ship--\nwe can't run away.\nWe're fighting and\nif we lose, we die.\nSo SEALS can't quit.\nIt was this, a little\nover the top, expression.\nBut when you take that\na little bit further,\nwhen you look at the\nhistory of the Navy.\nIf we were in the\nNavy 150 years ago,\nyou would have to\ngo on deployment.\nYou would take your ship\nand you would sail somewhere\nand you wouldn't be able\nto talk to me anymore.\nSo you would have\nto understand what\nit is you were\ntrying to accomplish\nand then just go out\nthere and make it happen.\nThat's decentralized command.\nAnd that's something that\nexists in the SEAL teams\nwithout question, very\ndecentralized command.\nAnd that's one of the absolute\nstrengths of the SEAL teams\nis you've got leaders at every\nlevel inside the organization.\nThat if they don't\nknow exactly--\nif they're not told what\nto do, they're going to go,\nOK, I haven't been\ntold what to do\nbut I'm going to\ngo figure it out.\nAnd that's one of the\nstrengths of the SEAL teams.\nWe have more doctrine now, but\nwhen I came in the SEAL teams,\nthere was no doctrine.\nIt was all word of mouth.\nAnd so the army and\nthe Marine Corps,\nif you have to\nconduct an ambush,\nyou can pull out\na manual and you\ncan look up how to conduct\nan ambush-- platoon ambush,\nhow to conduct it-- and\nit's all written very clear.\nAnd they're great documents.\nThat's the FM 7-8 infantry\nplatoon and squad,\nI think is the army doctrine.\n- I can see the little neurons\nin your hippocampus firing\nin sequence.\n- Yeah.\n- It's embedded\nin there forever.\n- And it's a great manual.\nAnd you can pull that\nthing out and you\nhave a place to start from.\nIn the SEAL teams, we\ndidn't have that at all.\nSo you would hear from\nyour platoon chief,\nthis is how you\nconduct an ambush.\nAnd he had heard it from his\nplatoon chief, who heard it\nfrom his platoon\nchief, who heard it\nfrom his platoon chief, and that\nplatoon chief was in Vietnam.\nSo it's getting passed down but\nyou can make adjustments to it.\nAnd you can alter the plan\na little bit because hey,\nthe terrain is\ndifferent, or hey,\nthe night vision we now have.\nSo there's changes\nthat we can make\nbecause there's no doctrine.\nSo not having any doctrine,\nin many ways, is a strength.\nAlso it can be a weakness.\nBecause if you've got a new\nplatoon commander that's never\ndone an ambush before and he\nhas no idea what he's doing,\nthis platoon chief has been\nout of the loop for a long time\nand he doesn't know what he's\ndoing, there's no reference.\nSo there's strengths\nand weaknesses,\njust like any characteristic.\nEverybody's characteristics,\nyou've got strength\nand you've got weaknesses.\nAnd your weaknesses\ncan be strengths\nand your strength\ncan be weaknesses.\nTo get back to your\noriginal question,\nare there stereotypes inside of\neach of the military branches?\nSure.\nBut are there outliers in\neach of the military branches?\nThere are absolutely.\nAnd that's why you can't\njudge a book by its cover.\n- For people listening to this\nwho are not in the military,\nmaybe have some military\nlineage in their family\nor not, but who want to\nunderstand a little bit better\nabout how structure\nand lack of structure\ncan both support being\neffective in life,\nin relationships, in daily\nlife, in fitness, in business,\nin school--\nI think those are\nthe big domains--\nin creative endeavors.\nI think it would be useful for\nthem to understand a little bit\nabout how you in particular\nbalance discipline\nand structure with,\ndare I say, lack\nof discipline and structure.\n- Well, you could\nactually just say\nthe word freedom, because\nthat's what it turns into.\n- Or maybe even play.\nI bring this up in\npart because I've\nseen some posts that you put\nup of you playing the guitar\nwith friends or music.\nOne of them was a\ntribute to someone\nwho either was killed in\ncombat or had passed away.\nSo these moments of\nconnection between people\nsometimes are working\ntogether, but sometimes\nare in relaxation and play,\nin these kinds of things.\nI think it was a really\nimportant post for people\nto see that while Jocko Willink\nkicks back with a guitar,\nnot trying to take over stages--\nmaybe you are.\nMaybe you have a plan.\nIf anyone could do it,\nyou'd probably be the one.\nBut what is the balance for\nyou in terms of structure\nand lack of structure?\nAnd I'm not going to ask\nfor your daily routine.\nWe know that you get\nup early, you train.\nBut I do have some\nspecific questions\nthat I think would be\nhelpful in putting some meat\non the notions about you.\nAnd again, this isn't\na pick into your life\nbut more to grab-- well,\nit's to pick into your life.\nThe-- so a question I\nasked you in the lobby\nbecause it's one\nthat having seen\nyour content for a long time\nand really benefited from it,\nI was curious.\nYou get up early\nat about 4:30, you\ntrain every morning, how\nlong do you train for?\nAnd is there any global\nstructure to that?\nAnd, of course, everyone\nneeds different programs,\nbut is it like weight\ntraining one day,\ncardio training the next day,\nor you're combining them?\nIs it always an hour or\nis it always half an hour?\nI think people would benefit\nfrom getting a little bit\nmore understanding of what\nthat looks like for you,\nwith the caveat that\neveryone has different needs\nlevels of background,\net cetera, but I'm\nintensely curious\nabout this and I'm\ncertain I'm not the only one.\nJOCKO WILLINK: So do you want\nto talk about weightlifting\nor rock and roll on the guitar?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nwant to talk about--\nlet's your let's talk about\nthe most structured first part\nof your day, and then let's talk\nabout the least structured part\nof your day, at least\nthe part that you\ncan share with the world.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nwaking up early\nand I'm going to work out.\nAnd depending on what's\ngoing on that day,\nif I have an early\nflight, I might work out\nfor eight minutes.\nI might go in and do\n2,000 meters on the rower,\nget a sweat going as hard\nas I can, and then I'm done,\nand-- because I've got\nto go catch a flight.\nSo that could be happening.\nMaybe I'm supposed to go surfing\nin the morning, I wake up,\nthe waves are terrible, and\nso now I've got nothing to do.\nI planned out to be surfing\nfor two or three hours,\nand now I'm not\ngoing to go surfing,\nso I'm going to go lift and\nI'm going to go play in the gym\nand do a bunch of stuff.\nI'm going to spend two\nor three hours in there.\nI love doing that.\nSo the workout could be\nanywhere between what\nI just say 8\nminutes and 3 hours,\nand it could be\nanything in between.\nI fully enjoy the physical\naspect of working out.\nSo if I have more time to spend\nin the gym, I'll spend it.\nI remember my dad\nsaying at one point,\nif I retired I wouldn't\nknow what to do.\nAnd I was thinking to myself,\nare you serious right now?\nIf I didn't have anything to\ndo, I'd spend six hours a day\nin the gym, I'd spend four hours\ndoing jiu-jitsu I could fill\nmy day--\nI could fill every day with\njust physical activity, things\nthat I just like doing.\nSo wake up early,\nget a sweat going.\nAnd do I lift?\nYes.\nDo I do cardio?\nYes.\nDo I run?\nYes.\nDo I sprint?\nYes.\nDo I lift heavy weights?\nYes.\nDo I swing kettlebells?\nYes.\nI do everything and anything,\nand I enjoy all of it,\nand I'm not really\ngood at any of it.\nI'm not really good at any one\naspect of physical activity.\nThere's people that are\ninfinitely better at me\nin every aspect,\nand I'm not just\ntalking about, Oh, this\nguy's a world-class, no.\nThere's like a guy named\nFred down at the gym that can\ndeadlift more than\nme, there was a guy--\nwhen I was at SEAL Team 2,\nthere was a guy who was,\nit's probably 5'7\", and\nhe looked kind of chubby,\nand he was older than me, and\nhe could run faster than me,\nand he could bench more than me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those\nguys are out there.\nJOCKO WILLINK: It was\njust so bothersome.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nthey're out there.\nThey've got some engine in\nthere related to something.\nI mean, I do think there are\ngenetic differences in terms\nof people's resilience\nand workout,\nbut even just grip\nstrength is highly, highly\nsubject to like\ngenetic influences,\nmaximum grip strength.\nBut of course,\nthere's a huge range\nin what people can develop.\nBut I guarantee your grip\nstrength is greater than mine.\nPeople ask me this\nall the time, who\nwould win in arm wrestling\nbetween you and Jocko.\nJOCKO WILLINK: You know\nthere's a lot of technique\nin arm wrestling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI have to imagine\nthey're putting\ntheir body behind it,\nthey're putting\ntheir back in that.\nJOCKO WILLINK: There's\na legitimate technique\nin arm wrestling--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which\nworked for me yet.\nJOCKO WILLINK: No, if we could\nbring a female arm wrestler\nin here that knows how to arm\nwrestle, because I don't know\nhow to arm wrestle either,\nand she would beat both of us\nbecause there's a lot more\ntechnique in arm wrestling\nthan most people recognize.\nThere's all these little\ngames that are going on.\nThere's all this little\narm position that you get.\nSo just like everything\nelse, it's technique.\nThere's a lot of technique\nin arm wrestling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's good to know.\nI didn't know that\nabout arm wrestling.\nI think we all start off with\nsome genetic predispositions,\nboth good and bad, for different\nthings, and then there's--\nas far as we know,\nthere's a huge range\nbased through neuroplasticity\nand muscle adaptation,\net cetera, in what\nwe can obtain.\nSo I never want\ngenetic predisposition\nto serve as a barrier.\nNo one knows also what the upper\nlimits of any of these things\nare.\nAnd some of the best examples\nwe know from sport and certainly\nfrom academia are\npeople who knew\nthey were at a\ndisadvantage and just\nworked 10 times harder\nthan everybody else\nbecause they had\nan ax to grind with\ntheir genetic\ndisadvantage, which is\nreally cool at the face of it.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreen since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nin Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains\na number of adaptogens\nvitamins and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met, and it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up Athletic\nGreens while you're on the road\nin the car, on the\nplane, et cetera,\nand they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3/K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3/K2.\nSo you get the training, and\ndo you track your training\nin a detailed way?\nAre you keeping\ntrack of lists and--\nJOCKO WILLINK: So I\nwrite down what I do,\nand I'll write down--\nI write down what\nI do every day.\nAnd that way, I can\ngo back and say,\nwhat was I doing back then?\nBecause I might go\nthrough some phase\nwhere I'm trying\nto do more pull ups\nor I'm trying to deadlift\nmore and I'm trying--\nwhatever the thing\nis, I'll go back\ninto-- because I get bored\nof deadlifting after a while.\nAnd let's face it, if you just\nwant to be a good deadlifter,\nyou're not going\nto be that fast.\nYou're going to be\nslow on long runs,\nso you don't want to go\ntoo deep into deadlifting.\nAnd you also don't want\nto be so good at long runs\nthat you can't deadlift\na good amount of weight.\nSo I kind of go through\nphases, and I'll\nget into something\nfor a while, and then\nI'll get into something else.\nSo I do log down what I'm doing\nso that way I can look back\nand say, Oh, dang, I'm not\neven close to as strong\nas I used to be, need\nto get back to that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm fascinated\nby the concept of energy.\nI think it's one of the most\ninteresting aspects in all\nof biology, all of\npsychology, and all of life.\nAnd when I say energy,\nI mean the distinction\nbetween being back\non your heels,\nflat footed, or\nforward center of mass.\nAnd I get the\nimpression, and I think\neveryone gets the\nimpression that you're\nsomebody with a lot of energy,\nand I wonder whether or not\nyou wake up with a\nlot of energy and you\nfeel like you have to burn it\noff with this physical activity\nand work and other\ndemands in your life,\nor do you find that you\nwake up and your energy\nis kind of neutral, and\nexercise and physical activity\ngives you energy?\nBecause I think this is one\nof the key things out there,\nI think, that acts as\na barrier for people\ndoing more with their\nbody because maybe they\ndon't want to tire\nthemselves out\nor maybe they don't feel\nlike they have enough energy\nto begin with.\nIt's also feeds into this\nidea that some people just\nhave a lot of energy.\nThey're really physical,\nand other people aren't.\nSo let's just say\non most days do\nyou wake up feeling\nlike you want\nto burn off energy,\nbuild energy, what\nis exercise mean to you?\nAnd then maybe we\ncan talk about some\nof the underlying stuff going\non there because I think we\nboth might find it interesting.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I\nwould say it's both.\nThere's no way I could sit\nhere and say, oh, yeah,\nevery day that alarm\nclock goes off,\nand I'm like, oh, yeah,\nlet's rock and roll.\nNo, certainly\nthat's not the case.\nIt's also certainly not\nthe case that every day I'm\nlike, oh, god, not again.\nNo, I'd say most of the time\nthe alarm clock goes off,\nand I don't think a bunch.\nWhen my alarm clock goes\noff, I don't think a bunch.\nI don't debate with myself.\nI'm not negotiating.\nThe thing goes off, and I'm\ndoing what I'm supposed to do.\nSort of robotic.\nNow this much I can say,\nwhen you go and work out,\nyou're going to feel better.\nYou will get energy\nfrom working out.\nThat is a guarantee.\nIf you go work out, you're\ngoing to feel better.\nIf you go break a sweat,\nyou're going to feel better.\nYou're going to get\nmore energy from it.\nAnd look, you got\nto go really, really\nhard to where now you feel\nmore tired when you're done.\nAnd even that, I mean,\nyou've got to go psycho.\nI'll do that occasionally, but I\ndon't do that on a daily basis.\nAt the end of the day, if\nI wake up, lift, run, surf,\nand then I do jiu-jitsu\nin the afternoon,\nat the end of that day,\nI'm tired and I feel tired.\nBut normal day working out\njust makes you feel better.\nDefinitely gives you--\ndefinitely gives me energy,\nI should say, because I\nguess I'm not everybody.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I think\nit's a very important point\nbecause one of the things that\nwe are learning from circadian\nbiology, time of day effects\nand sunlight and all that stuff\nthat we talk about\nin our podcast\nthat you've done\nintuitively, this\nis what we kind of arrive to.\nJOCKO WILLINK:\nIt's kind of crazy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: As last\ntime we had a conversation\nis that so many of the\nthings that science\nis telling us to do\nand that we emphasize\non this podcast\nyou've been doing\nor are built into military\nschedules, and one of them\nis this notion of\nwaking up early\nand getting physical\nearly in the day.\nAnd I suppose if we were\nto just throw one blanket\nrule on the table to encompass\nthe broadest number of themes\nit's that once every 24\nhours, we each and all\nget a big increase in this\nrelease of the hormone\ncortisol, which everyone says,\noh, cortisol it's terrible,\nhe's going to burn you\nout, adrenal burnout, all\nthat stuff, but it's\na non-negotiable peak.\nAnd you want it to arrive\nearly in the day and viewing\nsunlight, physical\nactivity, caffeine,\nand in particular\nintense exercise,\nall amplify that cortisol peak.\nIn fact, I think the\nnumbers I'm seeing\nis just sunlight\nviewing gives you\na 50% increase in that cortisol.\nExercise on top of that,\nanother 50% to 75% increase.\nSo this huge release in this\nhormone that everyone thinks\nis terrible but actually\nsets this huge wave\nin motion for the rest of\nthe day, which gives you\nmore energy, higher levels of\nimmune function, more focus,\net cetera, and does\nindeed as you mentioned\nin your example of\nyour daily life sets\na timer so that about 14 to\n16 hours later, you're sleepy,\nwhich is what you want 14 to 68\nhours later, unless, of course,\nyou're running vampire\nshifts in the military\nor you're on shift work, but\nmost people aren't, of course.\nSo I think the idea that\nmovement and exercise gives us\nenergy I think is an important\nidea and it's something\nthat frankly I was hoping\nyour answer would be that, as\nopposed to that you\nwake up every day\nand you just want to just attack\nthe world because you have\nso much energy getting out\nof bed because frankly, I\nnever feel that way.\nBut I always feel\nbetter after I train.\nAlways.\nAnd of course,\nthere are times when\nI crash in the early afternoon\nif I train really, really hard,\nbut usually that's\nwhen I over-caffeinated\nto an outrageous degree, and\nthen I don't nourish after,\nor I over nourish.\nSo this is the other thing\nthat eating, the whole rest\nand digesting, the digest\nword in there is meant to--\nit's there for a\nreason, which is\nthat when we eat\na really big meal,\nwe actually need to slow down.\nSo I hate to get\ninto daily schedules\nat the level of\nnitpicking, and nutrition\nis about the most controversial\ntopic on the internet,\nbut do you nourish\nafter you train?\nAnd if you do, do you\ndo it to the point\nwhere you're kind of like, OK,\nI'm mostly full or I'm full?\nAre you trying to\nreally nourish yourself,\nor do you find that\neating slows you down?\nJOCKO WILLINK: I find\nthat eating slows me down.\nAnd I would say, again, it's\nweird how some of this stuff\nis.\nThe main reason I got in\nthe habit of waking up early\nand working out is\nbecause if you do it\nbefore anyone else is awake,\nthen they can't bother you\nand you can get stuff done.\nYou go to the SEAL\nTeam and you get\nthere before anyone else is\nthere, no one can say, hey,\ncan you help us with this?\nHey, no one sent you an email.\nSo you get that time, you\nget it done, and it's yours.\nI remember when you\nwere on my podcast,\nand I don't wear sunglasses\nwhen I run in the morning\nbecause I sweat and it\nfills my sunglasses.\nIt's not because I want to\nlet the UV light into my eyes,\nthat's not cortisol.\nIt's not for the cortisol.\nI didn't know that.\nIt's cool that I know it\nnow, but I just did it\nbecause I don't like to\nsweat in my sunglasses,\ncan't see, so I just run\nwithout, I don't put a hat on.\nAs far as eating, I don't like\nto do physically active things\nwith food in my stomach.\nThat's just the way it is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, me either.\nJOCKO WILLINK: And\nso I don't want it.\nAnd what really\nkeeps that in line\nfor me is I'm doing\njiu-jitsu in the afternoon,\nand so if I'm\neating a big lunch,\nby the time the afternoon\nrolls around, I'm kind of I\ngot food in my gut, and I\njust don't like that feeling.\nSo no, I don't eat\na big meal until I'm\nkind of done with the physical\nstuff for the day, which\nis usually at night,\n6, 7 o'clock at night,\nwhich I guess there's some\nbad things about that I\neat too late.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nthe data say if you're--\nyeah, we could go down\na rabbit hole with this\nand then someone's\ngoing to pull up\nsome little clinical\nstudy and then another one\nthat counters that.\nI mean I think the\ndata essentially\nsay that having a regular\nmeal schedule that\nallows you to sleep well at\nnight, whatever that means\nfor you, and that allows you\nto be active and focused when\nyou need to be\nactive and focused,\nthat's the ideal schedule.\nJOCKO WILLINK: When I'm\nworking with clients,\nso I have a leadership\nconsulting company Echelon\nFront.\nWhen I'm going to\nwork with a client,\nI'm not eating because\nthey're going to be asking me\nquestions, we're going\nto be diving into what's\nhappening inside their\nbusiness, there's\na lot of stuff going on.\nIt's a lot of cognitive work.\nSo I'm not eating\nbefore a podcast.\nI'm not eating before a podcast.\nBefore I'm recording\na podcast, I'm\nnot eating because\nI don't want to have\na bunch of food in my stomach.\nYou get a certain\nlevel of mental clarity\nwhen you haven't\neaten a bunch of food.\nSo going out on\nmissions, I never\nwould eat before I\ngo out on a mission.\nI would eat when I come home.\nYou get home at 4\no'clock in the morning,\n3 o'clock in the morning\nfrom doing operation, cool,\nthen I'll eat because\nthen I'm going\nto do a debrief for 15\nminutes, clean weapons,\nand then eat a big\nmeal, go to sleep.\nCool.\nYeah, I don't want to\nhave food in my stomach\nwhen I've got to perform\nor execute anything.\nSo again, I think that's\njust kind of a fluke\nthat I ended up\nliving like that,\nbut that's kind of how I live.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\na fortunate fluke\nfor all of us because so\nmuch of what you embody\nand what you do I think centers\naround this idea of discipline,\nof course, but also energy.\nIt's the intuitive sense I\nget about why people are so\ndrawn to your messaging and\nwhat you do and how you do it.\nEnergy we know, of\ncourse, is caloric energy.\nAnd I think that's what\nmost people default to.\nThey go, oh, how many\ncalories are energy\nand how many calories in\nthat and you need calories\nto fuel things.\nBut the energy that\nyou're describing I think\nis the one that--\nwell, it really maps the\nEastern traditions more directly\nto how yin and yang thing--\nyin and yang, I always\nget that wrong-- so which\nis the notion of neural energy.\nAnd so there's a particular\ncluster of chemicals in us\nas a fancy name called\nthe catecholamines.\nBut that's dopamine,\nepinephrine,\nwhich is adrenaline\nand norepinephrine,\nand then you've got cortisol.\nAnd those four hang out\ntogether and basically give us\nenough energy to run our\nbrain and body for 50 days.\n50 days.\nSo the idea that you have to\neat before you train, sure,\nfor some people that might\nwork better than others,\nbut I think what\npeople don't realize\nis that anytime we're\ntaking in caloric energy,\nit takes neural energy in\norder to digest that and put it\ninto storage.\nAnd so the way you\ndescribe your day of, yeah,\nI also don't eat before I train.\nI like to hydrate\nand caffeinate.\nI have been drinking\nthese before I train.\nI have to limit myself to two\nbefore because otherwise, I'm\nlike picking up--\nI'm already quaking a little\nbit at the second one.\nBut I have a pretty\nhigh caffeine tolerance.\nSo I like to train first also.\nAnd then I find it\ngives me energy.\nBut then the moment that I eat a\nmeal that's a little too large,\nall of a sudden\nI'm out of energy.\nAnd what's the deal?\nThese calories\nare energy, right?\nYou're supposed to have energy\nin order to think and move.\nAnd I think I think a lot of\nthe world has this backwards.\nAnd this isn't a push\nfor intermittent fasting\nor any particular\nstyle of eating really,\nI don't care if people\nare carnivores, vegan,\ndoesn't matter to\nme whatever works.\nI happen to be an omnivore.\nBut I think once\npeople understand\nthe energy to do\nthings is neural,\nand yet, of course, it relies\non having glycogen and all\nthis stuff around, but neural\nenergy is what's really about,\nthen your schedule and\nthe way you function\nand the way you\ndescribe your schedule\nreally makes a ton of sense.\nSo you described getting up\nand lifting, running, surfing,\nand jiu-jitsu in the same day.\nSo on a day like that,\nyou're hydrating, correct?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Oh,\nyeah, definitely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause that's vital.\nAnd I know in the Teams,\nin the SEAL Teams,\nthere's a lot of discussion\nabout hydration is important,\neven though you guys\nI know are supposed\nto be able to eat sand and\nsurvive on sunlight and dirt\nand drink your own blood.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Not me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Hydration\nis taken seriously, right?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nand different people\nneed different\namount of hydration.\nAnd I, unfortunately, was one.\nI always needed to\nbring a lot of water\nin the field which sucked\nbecause water is heavy.\nAnd I have friends.\nOne of my friends, Tony, BTF\nTony, he'd go in the field\nwith like a can of Copenhagen\nand coffee in his canteen\nand go like three\nstraight days--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's\nlike a desert turtle.\nJOCKO WILLINK: He's\na desert rat, man.\nHe could just survive.\nAnd I would always have\nto bring this water.\nI sweat a ton when\nI work out or when\nI'm doing anything that\nrequires physical output.\nI sweat a ton, so I have to\ndrink a lot of water for sure.\nBut not everyone's the same.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I think\nif most people focus more\non hydration and movement.\nThey would find they have two--\nI'm going to venture\na guess here,\nthis is not a scientific study,\nbut two to four times more\nenergy than if they focused on\ncaloric energy and what to eat.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, and I\nthink the cool thing about this,\nyou're using the term energy.\nAnd what's cool about this\nis you or I create energy.\nI create energy by, like I\nsaid, by going and lifting\nin the morning, by\ngoing and doing--\nyou go do burpees?\nYou go do 100 burpees like\nyou're creating energy.\nYou're going to be tired,\nyou're going to be sweating,\nbut you just created energy.\nSo that stuff is\ntotally true I'm\nglad there's neuroscience\nto back it up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I'm actually\nthinking about devoting\nsome of my lab to this.\nOne of the best examples,\nanother familiar territory\nfor you is cold water.\nNowadays there's a lot about\nice baths and cold baths\nand showers and all that, and\nI always like to just say,\nlisten it's all just a\nreliable source of inducing\nadrenaline release.\nAnd you get out of a cold\nshower, you have more energy,\nand that energy couldn't\nhave been caloric energy,\nit's adrenaline.\nAnd again, it's fair\nto say I'm obsessed\nby the ideas of identity,\nwhich is a little bit how\nwe started off and I want to\nget back to it, and energy.\nI feel like identity\nand energy can\naccount for 75% of what\nit is to live a good life\nif you can master\nthose, because then it\nall seems to fall into bins.\nOf course, you need sleep.\nWhy?\nWell, to restore\nyour neural energy.\nAt some point, you just\nfade out of neural energy\nif you don't sleep.\nSo sleep then falls\ninto a particular bin\nwith a particular\npurpose, and then exercise\nbecomes not a way\nto burn energy but,\nas you said, to create energy.\nAnd we actually are\nstarting to understand\nwhy this is if you'll\nindulge me for a second\non some neuroscience.\nWe didn't talk about\nthis last time.\nWe have neural circuits that\ncontrol deliberate action.\nWe have neural circuits that\ncontrol deliberate actions\nthat when we forget that\nwe're doing like walking.\nAnd then we have\nneural circuits which\nare called central\npattern generators.\nAnd these are the\nneural circuits\nthat love to just work on their\nown, and in the background\njust kind of hum\nin the background\nand take care of all the stuff\nlike heartbeat, breathing\nand movement that is repetitive.\nIf you're just\nmarching and you don't\nhave to adjust\nyour cadence much,\nor maybe you're hiking even\nand stepping this rock,\nthat rock, once those central\npattern generators get going,\nit's very automatic.\nAnd we know that once your\ncentral pattern generators get\ngoing, there's the release\nof those catecholamines,\nthose three or four\nmolecules that then feed\nall the other neural systems.\nThey're called neuro\nmodulators for a reason\nbecause they set\nthe gain higher.\nSo when you go out for a run\nor a jog or a hike or something\nor you pedal or\nyou row, and then\nyour whole system\nis at a higher RPM\nso when you say create\nenergy, neuroscientists\nare starting to understand what\nthat is, repetitive movement\nthat allows you to forget\nthe motor commands that\nare required to\ngenerate that movement.\nYou might think about your row\nstroke or something like that,\nbut you can do it\nwithout thinking much.\nYou come off of that and you\nnow are set at a higher RPM\nto do more deliberate stuff.\nAnd none of this, again,\ninvolve like eating\nenough carbohydrates or making\nsure you had enough ketones\nor enough protein.\nIt's like you got\nplenty of that stuff\nprovided you nourish at some\npoint every 24 hours or so.\nI think we know a little bit\nabout the science behind Jocko\nWillink's schedule now,\nbut I will ask this,\nare there certain\nforms of exercise\nlike weight lifting\nversus cardio\nthat you find give you\nan especially big boost\nin what we're calling energy?\nAnd here this could\nbe cognitive energy,\nit could be physical energy, a\nreadiness for the next thing?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, first I\ngot to back you up on this.\nI love backing up your science.\nSo do you ever ruck march like\nput on a heavyweight and ruck?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nsorry to interrupt.\nYeah, Peter Attia\ngot me into this.\nHe got me into doing\na long Sunday--\ninstead of a long\nSunday, run throwing\non a lightweight vest\nor a ruck, and going out\nfor like three hours.\nAnd the first 20\nminutes, I find I always\nwant to go faster\nand get it over with.\nBut then I've learned\nthat the real pain in it\nsets in around an hour,\nand then the beauty\nsets in around 90\nminutes, where you're\nlike, I could do this\nall day, all night,\nand I never want to stop.\nJOCKO WILLINK: See that's\nwhen you were describing\nhow these chemicals\nget released,\nand once you're in\nthat automatic mode--\nbecause in the\nSEAL Teams, you're\ndoing Maritime\noperations for a month,\nand then you're going to\ndo some kill shooting,\nand so you're not carrying\na bunch of weight.\nAnd then you go\nout to the desert\nand now you're\nputting on 80 pounds\nand you're going on day\none, and you get out there,\nyou're going on an\n80 pounds ruck march.\nAnd the first freaking 17\nminutes, the first 23 minutes\njust suck.\nThey just suck.\nAnd what was beautiful\nwas by the time I\nwas 23, 24 years\nold, like, oh, yeah,\nthis is going to\nsuck for 17 minutes,\nand then it's going to be--\nI'm going to be a robot and\nit doesn't matter anymore.\nI can just keep going forever.\nSo now it sounds\nlike what you're\nsaying is what I experienced\nbasically my whole adult life.\nThere's going to be a little\nbreak in period mentally\nwhere you think\nthis totally sucks,\nand then you just can keep going\nfor a really, really long time,\nand it's not that big of a deal.\nTo your question of is there any\nform of exercise that gives me\nthat energy, I would have to\nsay like the high intensity\nsort of anaerobic blast,\nwhether it's on the bike\nor on the rower or swing and\na kettlebell hard, something\nlike that that lasts\n10, 15 minutes, that's\na really good way to peak\nmy mentality for the day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\ndo the cold water thing?\nI mean, you certainly did a\nlot of it in BUD/S. I mean,\ndo you force yourself into cold\nwater and the you release--\nJOCKO WILLINK: I have a\ncold bath in my house,\nand I get in every day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: How long\nare you spending in there?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Usually\naround five minutes.\nFive minutes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Before you\ntrain or after you train?\nJOCKO WILLINK: After.\nSo this is something I\nhaven't played with yet,\nand for me, I'm like such a--\nI don't like to make a bunch\nof effort for something.\nSo for me going downstairs\ngetting in the ice tub--\nand I guess you\nonly need to do it--\nbefore you work out, you\nonly go a minute, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\ndo a minute to three.\nJoe and I have been texting\nback and forth about this.\nThere's a lab at Stanford,\nCraig Heller's lab that\nworks on cold and\nperformance, and the athletes\nat Stanford, mainly\nthe cross-country team\nand the football\nplayers are doing\ncold before their training\nbecause of the huge increase--\nhuge long lasting increase in\ndopamine and adrenaline that's\ncaused by that.\nThey're finding it\nincreases performance\nmainly by waking people\nup and getting them--\nit creates energy, basically.\nAnd students, everyone\nthinks of like, oh, athletes\nare all super motivated.\nThis is no pick against\nStanford athletes in particular.\nA lot of athletes\nare excellent at what\nthey do because they're very\nlazy when they're not training.\nThis is true.\nNot all athletes, but\na lot of athletes are.\nAnd so they're really good\nat resting and recovering\nso they can train more.\nBut a lot of athletes have a\nhard time getting into gear\nto train every day, and the\ncold is a great stimulus.\nIt's like a four shot of\nespresso kind of stimulus\nwithout all the jitters.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I think maybe\ngoing in there for a minute\nwould be cool before a workout.\nI will say this.\nSo I had a long workout and\nit was a Saturday, which means\non Saturday I do jiu-jitsu in\nthe morning around 10 o'clock,\nand I had like a long\nworkout, went for a long run,\nit was hot, and I just\ngot in the ice bath\nand I sat in there for like 7\nminutes like the deep chill.\nI got out and then I went right\nto jiu-jitsu, and I felt awful.\nI felt absolutely\nawful like tight cold,\nand it took me an extra three\nrounds to get warmed up again.\nSo that kind of left a bad taste\nin my mouth for pre-work icing.\nBut I'm going to try this\nshort because I was talking\nto another friend of mine,\nthey're like, oh, no,\nonly go a minute before.\nMaybe I'll give that a try.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If it's really\ncold, 30 seconds to a minute\nis going to get you\nthis big release\nand adrenaline and dopamine.\nJOCKO WILLINK:\nActually one time I\ndid try the chamber that\nblasts cold air on you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The cryo.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nthe cryo, and I\ndid that for like a\nminute or whatever,\nand that did make me feel\npre-workout pretty good.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I think\nthat the whole notion of cold\nfor metabolism,\npeople say, well, it's\nnot that big of an increase\nin metabolism, look,\nas far as I'm concerned,\nthe main function\nof the cold for\nmost people is going\nto be the discipline of doing\nit, the sense of resilience\nthat you can build up over time\njust being familiar with having\nadrenaline in your system.\nAnd then the fact that the\ndopamine increases are huge\nand long lasting, I mean,\nthey're like 2.5x increases.\nThere's a colleague\nof mine at Stanford,\nan alumni who runs our dual\ndiagnosis addiction clinic.\nShe had a patient getting\noff cocaine addiction who\ndecided to use cold ice baths as\na way to kind of assist himself\nalong the way.\nHe wasn't getting dopamine\nfrom cocaine anymore,\nso he decided to get\nit from the ice bath.\nThe difference is cocaine\ngives you these sharp increases\nand then decreases that\ndrop you way below baseline,\nso what do people do if\nthey go seek more cocaine,\nit's really pernicious that\nway, whereas the ice bath\nand cold showers will give\nthis long arc lasting two\nto three hours or more.\nAnd that's really\nsomething to treasure,\nthe idea that you can basically\nsave on your heating bill\ngive yourself this\nhuge dopamine increase.\nAnd I think everything\npoints to the fact\nthat it's healthy\nand good but I mean\nobviously it's working for you\nto do it after your training.\nI think all the gym rats who\nwant more hypertrophy you're\ntrying to get an extra 1/8\nof an inch on their tricep\nor whatever, they freak out\nbecause they hear that it\ncan inhibit hypertrophy.\nAnd then for whatever\nreason, there's this--\nJOCKO WILLINK: So\nam I doing it wrong?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I\nmean, yeah, clearly you're\ndoing it right now.\nNo, you're not-- I don't think\nyour hypertrophy is suffering.\nI actually am of the\nmind that if you're\ntraining really hard, sure,\ngetting in the cold afterwards\nmight blunt some hypertrophy\nthat is what the data tell us.\nAndy Galpin is kind of the\nexpert on that literature.\nBut frankly, I don't\nknow anyone that\ntrains really hard\nwith the weights\nand then gets into the cold\nthat looks like they're\nsuffering from hypertrophy.\nI know a lot of\npeople, however, who\nlove to point fingers at\nand poke at cold exposure.\nThis seems to be a big\nthing on social media.\nPeople who don't like the\ncold love to point out\nthe studies showing that the\ncold screws up everything,\nand most of them look like they\ncan eat a few sets in the gym\nto me.\nAnd I feel comfortable\nwith poking at them\nbecause I feel like all\nof these are just tools.\nAnd in any case, I'm a big fan\nof deliberate cold exposure,\nmostly for the neural effects.\nAgain I'm obsessing over\nthis concept of energy,\nand it's something that\nI can't help but ask\nthat is the cognitive side of\nthis and the effects of winning\nand losing.\nSo you obviously have\na lot of deployments\nand a lot of wins, whatever\nin the context that meant.\nKill the target, capture\nthe hostage, et cetera.\nAnd then as is\nthe case with war,\nthere have been some\ncases of losses.\nYou've lost people.\nMaybe there were targets\nthat weren't accomplished,\nthis kind of thing.\nAnd you've posted about\nthese, and these are always\nthings that are\nhard to see, but I\nthink it's really it's\nimportant that you\npost about people that you've\nlost because, first of all,\nthese people served, but\nsecond of all, things\ndon't always work out\nthe way that we want,\nand sometimes to really\ncatastrophic consequences.\nThere's a theory in\nbiology that when we win,\nwe somehow get more\nenergy to win more\nthrough the release of,\nno surprise, dopamine\nand some related molecules.\nAnd in fact, testosterone\nin both men and women\nis another close cousin\nof the dopamine system.\nThey're actually released\nfrom the same general--\npatterns of release are\nfrom the same general areas\nin the brain, believe\nit or not, and body.\nBut when we win, we feel\nlike we can keep going.\nYou look at the team\nthat wins and it's\nlike they'll play another game.\nThe Super Bowl\nwinners you imagine\nthey're jumping up and down,\nand they could probably\nplay another Super Bowl.\nLosing we know can\nsure can drop things\nlike testosterone and dopamine\nfor some period of time.\nBut when you were\nin the Teams what\nwas your observation about\nhow winning and losing\nwould impact people in\nthe short and long term?\nIn other words,\nwould you observe\npeople that had a\nquick reset button\nand could just say that was\nterrible, and then transmute, I\nguess I'm getting into\nthe Eastern language\nnow, to convert that into energy\nto go do better the next time?\nWhereas we also see\npeople, military\nand in the civilian\nworld that a loss,\nin particular severe\nlosses, basically set them\ndown the path of less\nenergy, and certainly\nis in less calories.\nIn fact, most of the\ntime it's the other way.\nThey start consuming\nmore calories\nand that doesn't get them going.\nSo again, this notion of\nenergy, and now I'm asking,\nwins versus losses\nwhat did you observe\nand from the perspective\nof leadership,\nand maybe more importantly from\nthe perspective of yourself,\nhow do you work with that?\nHow do you calibrate\nwins and losses?\nHow do you transmute\nlosses into energy?\nBecause winds we know\nwe convert to energy,\nbut losses oftentimes can\nsup our energy way, way down.\nJOCKO WILLINK: To\nstart with, I think\nthat the selection process\nto get into the SEAL Teams\nis going to weed out a bunch of\npeople that can't recover very\nquickly from something bad.\nSo you probably heard these\ntype of stories before.\nThe kid that was the star\nof the football team,\nthe star of the basketball\nteam, the captain of this,\nthe captain of that, he's\nbeen winning his whole life.\nHe goes to BUD/S and he quits,\nbecause in BUD/S, you're\nnot going to win.\nYou're certainly not\ngoing to win everything.\nThey're going to find\nwhat you're not good at,\nand they're going to exploit\nthat, and you're going to lose.\nThis is what happens.\nSo a lot of guys\nthat may lose and it\ndisrupts their motivation,\nthey're probably\njust going to quit.\nAnd so that's why you get\nthis massive attrition\nrate with guys that are studs.\nI mean, we're talking\nDivision 1 athletes.\nDivision 1 athletes,\nDivision 1 wrestlers,\nDivision 1 football\nplayers, Division 1 runners\nand swimmers.\nThey all come to\nBUD/S. They all quit.\nall of them quit\nbut there's plenty\nof examples of the highest level\nof collegiate athlete in sports\nthat translate very\nwell to what you're\ndoing in basic SEAL\ntraining, and they quit.\nAnd sometimes it's because\nthey don't know how to lose,\nthey don't know how to recover\nfrom a loss, and they're just--\nso I think already once\nyou get to a SEAL Team,\nyou've got people that\nare generally speaking,\ngoing to be pretty\nresilient when it\ncomes to dealing with a loss.\nNot only that, I\nmean, you just get\nused to talk about\nlosing people,\nyou're friends\nwith this guy, you\nmeet this guy in SEAL\ntraining, hey, this guy\nseems like a stud, oh,\nhe's just going to quit.\nAnd you're going\nto lose five, six,\nseven people, eight people.\nPeople quit so fast you cant'\neven keep track of them.\nSo you're just going to lose.\nYou're just going\nto get used to it.\nSo there's that.\nNow once you're in\nthe Teams, what you're\ntalking about is now you\nstart taking much more\nsignificant loss, you're\nnot losing a race,\nyou're losing of\none of your friends.\nAnd this is what from a\nleadership perspective\nyou have to pay attention to.\nSo when you're a leader\nin any organization,\nyou're basically\nin charge of a mob.\nWhen it comes to what their\nmorale is, they're a mob,\nand they feed off\nof each other, just\nlike a mob riding in\nthe streets going,\noh, we can break this window.\nLet's break all the windows, and\nthey move this mob mentality.\nAnd that happens with\nmorale inside of a team.\nAnd you as a leader can't\nget caught up with the mob.\nYou can't let that happen.\nYou have to detach yourself\nfrom the mob mentally so\nthat you don't get caught\nup in their emotions\nand their morale because if you\nget caught up in their emotions\nand you get caught up in their\nmorale, you can't correct it.\nSo we go out on a mission,\nthe mission goes great,\nwe get into a gunfight,\nkill a couple of bad guys,\neveryone's OK, high fives,\neveryone's feeling great.\nYou come back to base, hey,\nwe don't need a debrief.\nThat was perfect.\nHey, we don't need to\nget our gear maintained,\nwe can just go to\nbed, we're awesome.\nThat's when the leader has\nto say, oh, we've got the mob\nand the mob is becoming\nslightly arrogant.\nHey, guys, real quick,\nthat was a good op,\nbut there are some\nthings we could improve.\nYou got to bring that mob\nback and bring them back\nto center line.\nSame thing in the\nother direction.\nYou go out an operation,\nit doesn't go well.\nYou go out an operation,\nyou take casualties.\nNow you come back to base,\nyou see guys moping around,\nyou see the spirit starting\nto break, and same thing.\nIf you're part of that\nmob, you'll be with them,\nyour morale will be breaking,\nyour spirit will be breaking.\nYou've got to look up and say,\noh, I see what's happening.\nHey, guys, listen up.\nThat was tough.\nDidn't go the way\nwe wanted it to go.\nWe need to learn some lessons.\nHere are some things\nI can do better.\nWhat can we do better to make\nsure that never happens again?\nWhat can we do to make sure\nwe have the opportunity\nto go out and avenge our\nbrother on the battlefield?\nWhat can we do to move\nthis thing forward?\nSo as a leader when it\ncomes to winning and losing,\nyou're generally going to be the\nperson countering what the mob\nmentality is because when\nthe mob starts winning,\nthey want to keep winning\nand they might get arrogant.\nWhen the mob is\nlosing, they might\nstart to lose more because their\nattitude goes down the drain.\nSo that's where you\nhave to pay attention to\nfrom a leadership perspective.\nFor me personally,\nI know what I did\nwhen I lost guys was\nfocused on, all right,\nwe need to celebrate the life,\nwe need to mourn the loss,\nand then we need to go to work.\nWe need to get our gear back on.\nWe need to lock and\nload our weapons.\nWe need to get back out there.\nI know that that's\nwhat we needed to do.\nSo often, the best way\nto contend with problems,\nwith issues, with adversity is\naction, is by taking action.\nThe more you sit\nand the more you\nwait and the more time you\nspend with that adversity\nwith the upper hand\ninside your head,\nthe worse it's going to get.\nSo for me always taking action,\nmaking something happen,\nit doesn't have to\nbe huge, it doesn't\nhave to be some mammoth\ntriumph that you're\ngoing to go and\npursue, but if you say,\nhey, listen, this what happened.\nDidn't go the way\nwe wanted it to.\nWe're going to get\nour gear back on.\nWe're going to go back out.\nWe're going to do\nthis other mission.\nAnd that's what I think.\nTaking action, and it's\nin your personal life too,\nsomething doesn't go the\nway you wanted it to go,\nyou didn't get the\njob you wanted,\nyou didn't get the hire, you\ndidn't get the promotion,\nyou can go home and sit\nthere and dwell on it.\nThat's not getting\nyou any progress.\nOr you say, OK, you know what,\nlet me do a quick analysis why\ndidn't I get that promotion.\nOh, it's because I didn't\nget this qualification\nor I hadn't jumped\nthrough this gate.\nOK.\nCool.\nWhat do I need?\nLet me look into how do I\nget to jump through that gate\nso next time I will\nget the promotion?\nAnd you start taking action.\nSo action for me is a\ncure for a lot of problems\nthat we have in life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love this\nbecause the image that's\narising my mind, I'll\nshare it with you\nand tell me where it agrees with\nand maybe violates what you're\ntelling me, but what I was\nimagining it when you were\ntalking about leadership in\nthe mob is a bunch of candles,\nbut not wax candles,\nthese are oil candles.\nAnd you're talking\nabout a win, so it\ncould be an op to go out\nand win, it could be a team,\nit could be an individual taking\nan exam and they get an A-plus,\nit doesn't matter, but\nthey're riding high.\nI mean, those winds we know\ncrank up those catecholamines,\nand it's as if the\nintensity of that flame\nstarts going up\nas a consequence.\nThat's natural.\nBut the oil and the candle\nis continuing to burn down.\nLike you need to celebrate wins,\nbut you're burning that oil.\nAnd so what we're really\ntalking about here\nis how to moderate and\nthen reclaim energy.\nAnd I was imagining\nas the leader who\nlike OK, guys,\ngreat, but listen,\nyou're burning that oil.\nThat oil is what\ngot you the win.\nLet's not just clamp it like\nwe can do a few fist bumps\nand maybe celebrate\nit in some other ways,\nbut then let's take\nthe energy we got\nand put it to the next thing\nrather than just go crazy.\nDrugs of abuse, in\nparticular drugs\nthat tap into the dopamine\nsystem, namely cocaine\nand amphetamine, and just\nbecause there's no way\nto avoid this if we're\nbeing true to the biology,\nthe energy the\ndopamine system was\ndesigned for foraging\nfor all sorts of things,\nfood, so people that\noverindulge food or seek out\nfood, sex, people that\noverindulge in these things.\nThose things, and\nagain this sort\nof leans to Eastern\nphilosophy a bit but,\nthere's Western\nneuroscience or neuroscience\nwe should just\nsay to support it,\nyou start to deplete\nthese dopamine systems.\nThe baseline starts to drop.\nAnd so I'm imagining that\nthe leader, you in this case,\nis saying like, listen,\nlet's tone it down,\nuse the energy that we've\ngained and put it to good use,\nrather than just burn\nit up enjoying it.\nAnd then, of course,\nafter a loss when those--\nI sort of think of the\ncandles going dimmer\nbut the oil reserve\nis still there,\nand it's like how do\nyou start to tap back\ninto the oil reserve?\nWell, you have to actually\nramp the candle up again.\nYou can't just sit there waiting\nfor the intensity of the flame\nto come back.\nYou actually have to\ndo something in order\nfor that to happen.\nSo maybe this isn't\nthe best analogy\nbecause it lacks exactly\nwhat is the person turning\nthe intensity up and\ndown on these candles,\nbut that's what comes to mind.\nAnd in Eastern\ntraditions, there's\nthis idea of Qi of\nenergy, energy to fight,\nenergy to seek mates, energy\nto seek food, energy for sex,\nenergy for all of it\nis the same energy.\nAnd I actually believe that the\nenergy that they're referring\nto are these catecholamines.\nI really do.\nNow there are other\nenergy systems too\nrelating to child rearing,\npair bonding, oxytocin,\nall the kind of fuzzy warm\nstuff, that's super important.\nI mean, we wouldn't\nexist as a species\nthe way we do we didn't honor\nthat energy system also.\nAnd that energy system that\nwe normally think of as love\nas opposed to forward\ncenter of mass synergizes\nwith this system.\nWhen you're working with\nand training with and people\nthat you love, this could be\nyour brothers, your sisters,\nwhatever, your family, I\nthink there's an amplifying\neffect on this whole thing.\nIf is just for\nmore dopamine, just\nfor more money, just four more\nwins, just four more trophies--\nI'll never forget\nthis as an aside.\nWhen I was a kid, I had\nthis weird experience\nwhere Tony Hawk's dad rescued\nme from a skateboard contest\nin Linda Vista.\nThe Linda Vista Boys\nClub, everyone else\nleft, I was left there alone.\nI was 14 because of my home\nlife at that time, et cetera,\nand he was like,\nwhere are you going?\nI'm like, I'm going to\ntake the bus to Lancaster.\nI know this guy.\nAnd he was like, no, no,\nyou're coming to our house.\nI was like, OK.\nSo he took me at Tony's house,\nand I went into Tony's room\nthat he had grown up in.\nTony lived in\nFallbrook at that time.\nAnd the room wasn't\nfilled with trophies.\nThe room was trophies\nand I remember just\nthinking like, holy cow.\nAnd when I think\nabout that and I\nthink about what a healthy\nperson Tony turned out\nto be because I\nhappened to be blessed\nto know him a little\nbit, it's amazing\nbecause a lot of\npeople that had those\ntrophies whatever\ndomain of life,\nthey converted all that into\nways to just burn the oil down\nin their candle.\nHe's a guy who's still\ngoing in his 50s.\nSo that's a little\nside story, but I\nthink this notion\nof energy to me\nis so important\nbecause, as you said,\nwhen we move toward action\nand we complete something,\nthe oil in that candle\nstarts to get replenished,\nand the flame burns hotter.\nI'd like to take a brief\nbreak and thank our sponsor\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help me better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health

been measured\nor not, but what essentially\nwe're talking about\nis the confidence level.\nSo if I go out and win,\nI feel good about it.\nAnd let's say I'm doing\na jiu-jitsu tournament,\nand the first match\nI go out there\nand I submit the guy in 30--\ntake him down, submit him\nin 30 seconds.\nI'm feeling good.\nI'm feeling confident.\nSo what does that mean?\nMy dopamine is up because\nI got that victim.\nMy testosterone was up\nbecause I got that victory.\nMy confidence is up\nbecause I got that victory.\nSame thing other direction.\nIf I go out first match\nand I lose to somebody,\nmy dopamine goes down, that\nchemical thing goes down,\nmy confidence goes down.\nAnd what I have to\ndo is I have to learn\nhow to maintain a level of\nconfidence because if I get--\nif I win that first match,\nwin the second, I'll say,\nI'm going to kill this next\nguy, and I go out and I'm sloppy\nand I don't care.\nThat's when I get caught.\nIf I lack confidence,\nI go out there\nand there's nothing I will\ndo to beat this guy, that's\ngoing to be horrible.\nOf course, I'm going\nto get smashed.\nSo it's a similar thing\nthat we're talking about.\nI just wonder how\nmuch if you start\nmeasuring because they\nsay, hey, if you win,\nyour testosterone goes up.\nAnd then if you win more, your\ntestosterone goes up high.\nYour dopamine goes up high.\nYour confidence is going up,\nbut you can get to a point\nwhere your confidence\nis too high,\nand now you're getting sloppy,\nand now you don't care.\nAnd you mentioned cocaine.\nYou see like videos of\npeople that are all coked up\nand, hey, I can do this.\nThey think they\ncan do everything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAll possibility.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Over confident.\nThey're over they think\nthey can kick your ass off.\nThat's like too much\ndopamine, too much ego,\ntoo much confidence.\nThe other side of\nthe spectrum is\nsomeone that's on some\nkind of downer drug,\nand they don't feel like\nthey can do anything.\nThey're lethargic,\ntheir confidence is low,\nand they're just depressed.\nSo there's an interesting\ntie-in between dopamine, ego,\nconfidence, and\nprobably testosterone\nthat you get from\nwinning and from losing.\nAnd once again as a leader,\nfrom a leadership perspective,\nyou can't get\nwrapped up in that.\nYou can't get\nwrapped up in that.\nYou have to detach from it.\nYou have to be able\nto take a step back.\nAnd then if you're good\neven as a competitor,\nyou'll say, oh, yeah,\nthat last match was easy,\nbut I need to prepare\nfor the next match.\nI can't bring over confidence.\nLook, I don't want\nto lack a confidence.\nIt's a balance.\nIt's that flame on\nthe oil burning lamp\nthat you're talking about, that\nyou want that steady flame.\nYou don't want too much\ngoing to burn out of control.\nYou don't want too little,\nthe flame will go out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, earlier\nwe talked about this notion\nthat some of these older\nHungarian psychologists\nhad which this notion of\ngenerators versus projectors.\nAnd their idea was that\npeople sort of divide\ninto these different categories,\nand the world needs both.\nIt's not a that one is\nbetter than the other,\nbut the world\nabsolutely needs both.\nAnd there is this idea now\nbased on some neuroscience\nand some other\npsychology that I've\nbeen kind of glazing into\nwhich is that generators\nknow how to tap into the system,\nand they love this system.\nI think back to your story about\nbeing taken to shop for pants\nand it turns out to\nbe a trip to shop\nfor a number of different\nexperiences for you.\nA really telling experience,\nhaving an action effect\non the world and something\ncoming back to you that still\nsits with you inside.\nIn fact, there's\na dopamine circuit\nthere still related\nto this young woman\nor then young\nwoman at that time.\nSome people are\ngenerators and I think\nthat they are more attuned\nto this dopamine system.\nAnd so as we're having\nthis conversation,\nI'm guessing that\nabout the estimate\nis that somewhere between\n50 and 65% of people\nare going, yeah, I get it.\nMore workouts are going\nto give me more energy.\nI need to do more of that.\nI need to win I'm\nback on my heels.\nI need to think about the things\nI can complete, et cetera.\nAnd then the other 45% or\nso or 35% might be saying,\nI don't really get it.\nNow the idea is that\nthe projectors can\ntap into these same circuits.\nEveryone has these catecholamine\ncircuits, dopamine et cetera,\nbut that they tend to be more\nof observers in the world\nand they like being\npartnered with\nand symbiotic with these people.\nNow this starts to take on\nstereotypical masculine,\nfeminine things, but this exists\non both sides, it really does.\nThere might be some\nbiases by biological sex,\nthere may not be.\nWe could argue that.\nIt's probably an\nargument that'll\nget us into more\ntrouble than to answers,\nand doesn't really matter.\nThe point is that some\npeople are perfectly\nhappy to be in the\ncompany of people\nwinning because they feel good\nto see other people winning.\nThey like to be a support staff.\nThat's what makes\nthem feel good.\nOther people would rather\nstick hot forks in their eyes\nthan not be the person\nengaged in the activity.\nMaybe not every activity\nbut the activity.\nSo we're talking about the\ngenerators and the projectors.\nI think that in the context\nof moderating these systems,\nit's so key.\nI mean, it's key to have a\nlong arc and a career path,\nmilitary, science, or otherwise.\nI think it's key in\nevery domain of life.\nAnd I think for me,\none thing that I've\nlearned both the hard\nway and I've also\nbenefit from the\npositive experience of,\nI think in relationships,\nl this could\nbe romantic relationships,\nbut also friendships\nand in family, because there\nare generators and projectors\nalmost always in those kind\nof symbiotic relationship,\nromantic couple or a family,\nsome kids are more generators,\nsome are more projectors\njust by something, who knows?\nMaybe it's hardwired, maybe not.\nAs the leader of\nyour family, I'm\ngoing to assume one\nof the two leaders,\nbut as a leader in\nyour family, I'm\nnot going make any\nassumptions here,\nas the leader of\nyour family, and also\nas a father in\nparticular, how do you\napply these same\nsorts of ideas when\nyou know your kid is\nkind of down because it's\nhard to be a 14-year-old or\nbecause it was a bad day,\nor when they're up?\nI think the up states are as\ninteresting as the down states\nlike, yes, got the\ndegree, got the win.\nHow much do you\nlet them celebrate\nbefore you're like,\nhey, listen, you just\ngot yourself another\ncouple of milliliters\nof oil in your candle, what\nare you going to do with that?\nYou're going to burn\nit, or you going\nto save it for the next thing\nso you can climb the staircase?\nJOCKO WILLINK:\nWell, clearly it's\na very similar thing to\nwhat I just talked about.\nIf your kid is doing well and\nwins the wrestling tournament\nand is like, yeah, I won\nthe wrestling tournament,\nand what do they want to do?\nThey want to eat a\ntriple cheese pizza,\nI mean, they want to go\ncrazy and you as a leader\nand as a parent and as a\nfriend, you'd say, hey, man,\nI mean, you did good.\nThat was awesome.\nYou had a great\nday, but let's start\nthinking a little bit\nabout next week too.\nHow about we just have a few\nslices of pizza as a reward?\nSo this is the same\nin any situation\nthat you could be in interacting\nwith other human beings.\nYou want to be the person\nthat kind of modulates\nthe confidence and\nthe ego or the way\nyou put it, the dopamine and\nthe celebratory activities.\nSo no matter who you are,\nand this goes with yourself\nas well, you do something, you\nhave a success and you say,\nOh, that's great, but\nall glory is fleeting,\nand I need to get back to work.\nAnd look, and do people\ngo too far with that?\nSometimes yes, absolutely.\nSometimes people, they don't\nstop and celebrate at all.\nAnd those are the kind of people\nI think that get burned out\neventually because they never\nsay, hey, that was awesome.\nWe had a big win.\nCool, high five.\nThey don't even say that.\nSo I think as a\nleader, as a friend,\nas a parent, as a\nspouse, you want\nto be able to modulate\nthat, help modulate that,\ndon't shut it down.\nYour kid walks off the\nwrestling mat for a high five\nand you say, you could\nhave won by more.\nNo, I'm not talking about that,\nor your kid walks off the mat\nafter losing, you say,\nyou got what you deserve.\nNo you've got to be the\ncounterweight to the emotions\nthat other people have.\nAnd I think that when you're\ndoing a good job as a leader,\nas a friend, as a\nspouse or whatever,\nyou're doing a good\njob as a counterweight.\nI think that's a good\nway to look at it.\nYou want to provide\nsome balance for people\nto make sure that they\ndon't get out of control.\nAnd you notice when\npeople have a downfall,\nit's normally because\nthey've surrounded themselves\nwith people that\nthere's no counter to,\nthere's no counterbalance.\nIf you were my best friend and\nI went out drinking last night\nand had a great time and\npartied all night and met a girl\nand you're like, heck, yeah,\nlet's do it again tonight,\neventually, where\nare we going to be?\nWe're going to be in\nthe gutter somewhere.\nBut if you say, hey, that\nwas awesome, but remember we\ngot school on Monday, and\nyou kind of pull me back,\nwe got to find balance\nin life and ourselves,\nand then we got as much\nas we can provide balance\nfor other people because\npeople are emotional\nand they get caught up\nin what they're doing\nand you want to keep\npeople balanced.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\none of the reasons people\nare really drawn\nto your message,\nand I put myself\nin that category,\nand I remember 2014 was a\nvery different picture for me,\nit doesn't really matter\nwhat the contour was,\nthings were working,\nbut they weren't working\nthe way I wanted them to.\nAnd I remember arriving\nat your content\nfirst through the\nTim Ferriss podcast\nand then eventually the\nJocko Willink podcast,\nJoe Rogan podcast, those\nwere the big two ones\nthat kind of like introduced\nme to you and your content,\nand it was really a\ncase of at the time,\nI didn't have a\nlot of friends that\nwere doing similar\nthings to me or that\nmatched my daily\nroutines in a way\nthat I could kind of\nsynergize with in this way.\nI think one reason why you\nare so helpful to people\nis that not everybody\nhas these friends.\nYou can have the friend\nthat's like, let's go out\nand tie one on again,\na lot of people\ndon't even have that friend,\nor they have a friend,\nbut they're not really\nclose with that person.\nThere's some ideas\nnowadays about 80% of males\ndon't have a close friend\nthat they could call.\nI don't know, I mean,\nI'm guessing girls\nand women feel the same too that\na lot of stuff is superficial,\nand there's a lot\nof communication\nbut not a lot of connection.\nAnd so I think that you and\na few other people in the--\nlet's call it social\nmedia public facing space,\nserve as archetypes\nof the friend that's\ngoing to tell you when\nyou're up, great, but let's\nclamp it after a while,\nor that when you're down,\nlet's get going and\nhere's how you get going.\nAnd so I do want to highlight\nthat because I think\nit's really important and it's\nbut one reason why people are\ndrawn to your message and the\nmessage of some other people\nwho are out there trying\nto do similar things,\nbut you in particular\nbecause yes, you\nhave this military\nbackground, very\nintense military background,\nwartime background,\nbut also you bring it into\nthe daily routines that\ncertainly apply to everybody.\nMost everybody can\naccess non-heated water,\none would hope.\nThere's another\ndimension to this\nthat I want to just bring up and\nget your reflections on as it\nrelates to military, work,\nschool, relationship, family,\net cetera, which is somewhat\ncounterintuitive idea but then\nonce you hear it, it\nmakes perfect sense,\nwhich is that even though\nthe catecholamines are\nresponsible for drive, and\nthat that's what we're really\nabout when we're\nforward center of mass\nand we have to control the\nintensity of the candle\nand the level of the oil, I\ndon't know what those actually\nmapped to exactly.\nWe could probably figure it\nout if we really parsed it,\nbut that's the idea\nhere, the analogy.\nIn a kind of\nsurprising way, we know\nthat for sure one way to restore\nlevels of motivation drive\nenthusiasm, and to some\ndegree confidence that things\ncould be different is through\ndeep rest, things like sleep.\nWhen things are\nreally, really hard,\nwhen kids are just like they\nwere like falling apart,\nit's like you put them\nto sleep, they wake up\nand they're like\ndelightful, they're\nrunning around their\npajamas when they're little,\nand a teenager wakes up\nafter a good night's sleep,\nthey might be a little\nlike surly, but we're back.\nAdults are like this.\nThe world is falling apart.\nYou go to sleep, wake up,\nOK, I might be able to manage\nthis kind of mindset.\nSo sleep.\nAnd then the other\none is we know\nthat play, the kind of physical\nactivity or mental activity\nwhere it might be a\nlittle competitive,\nbut the stakes are low, and it's\nreally more about connection\nwith the activity or\nconnection with somebody else.\nLike we're going to\nplay a game of whatever,\nI won't play chess with Lex\nbecause he'll kick my ass,\nI won't do jiu-jitsu\nwith either of you\nbecause you'll beat me\nup both of you, kindly,\nbut you'll do it.\nBut if we were to play a\ngame, it's just us yeah,\nwe might be a\nlittle competitive,\nbut the stakes are low.\nWe know that play and\nsocial connection and sleep\nare basically the\nreservoir or the location\nthat you go to refill the oil\nin the candle every single time.\nAnd so for you, where do those\nthings play into your routine?\nYou mention you can go hard all\nday and then in the evening,\nis it dinner with family,\ntypically if you're at home,\nand what does that look like?\nI know we're kind\nof parsing in--\nI don't want to carve into\nyour personal life too deeply,\nobviously, there are\nboundaries there,\nbut what does that look like?\nIs it everyone at the\ntable, phones away,\nand you're talking\nabout the day?\nOr is it-- yeah, share\nwith us a little bit\nof what that looks\nlike because I think\nit is an important contour\nto what you're about\nand what we're talking\nabout that most people just\ndon't have a window into.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nso, well, first of all,\nI mean, just the refilling\nthe tank with games, I mean,\nthat's what jiu-jitsu is.\nYou're going to go\nand you're going\nto have social\nconnection with people,\nyou're going to talk to\npeople that you know,\nyou're going to\njoke about whatever,\nthen you're going to roll.\nYou're going to have\na good time rolling,\nyou're going to get\na little sweat on,\nyou're going to feel good,\nthen you're going to high five\nlike there's huge--\nthat's there, and your\nbrain is kind of off.\nWhen you're training\njiu-jitsu at a certain level,\nyou're not going to\nbe thinking anymore.\nSame thing with surfing.\nYou go surfing and\nyou catch a wave.\nI mean, you're not\nthinking about, oh, I\nneed to put my\nbalance over here.\nNo, it's happening and\nyou're having a good time.\nSo I would say that restoration\nfor me comes from those two\nthings for sure.\nAnd then yeah, I mean, my wife\nand my kids when I get home--\nand my kids are older now, and\nthey're out of the house except\nfor one.\nAnd when I was in the\nNavy when they were young,\nI wasn't around at all.\nWe would rarely have dinner\ntogether because I was gone,\ncoming home late, you're\nworking all the time,\nyou can never get all your work\ndone, I'm training jiu-jitsu,\nwe rarely ate dinner as a\nfamily when I was in the Teams.\nAnd now when I'm home, we\ncan eat together for sure.\nMy daughter that's\nstill at home,\nshe's going to-- we sit out\nthere and eat dinner and talk\nabout just normal things\nthat people talk about,\nlike how to conduct\na night ambush or--\nlet's talk about normal daily\nthings and what's going on.\nAnd my daughter,\nshe's 13 right now\nand she talks to me\nabout all kinds of stuff,\nand it's awesome.\nYeah, I'm definitely\nenjoying that aspect\nof being around more than I\nwas when I was in the Teams\nand we didn't have dinner.\nDidn't happen.\nSo I would take my\nkids to jiu-jitsu,\nI taught jiu-jitsu\nclasses when I could\nwhen I was in the Teams,\nwould do workouts with them\nin the morning if I had time\non the weekends for sure,\nstuff like that with my kids,\nthat's kind of what I did.\nBut now yeah, we--\nmy wife is awesome, and\nshe is a great cook now\nbecause when we first got\nmarried, it was questionable.\nI just was harassing her\nabout this the other day.\nShe's an unbelievable cook\nnow, and it's awesome.\nAnd when we first met,\nby her own admission,\nshe will tell you she was not.\nShe's from England,\nand so they're just\nnot cooking what we're liking.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No,\nthe food over there,\nat least when I was growing\nup in the few times I made it\nover there, the food\nwas pretty dreadful.\nI mean, there were some\nexceptions to that,\nand they drank a lot over there.\nSo I've been to some\nscientific meetings over there\nwhere they would start with\nlike Sherri in the afternoon,\nand then beer after work.\nIt was outrageous.\nI mean, the amount of alcohol\nintake was just absurd.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, Brits.\nAnd again I'm not trying to--\nI did an episode on\nalcohol, a lot of people\nwere angry about that episode\nbecause it's basically said,\nonce you get past\ntwo drinks a week,\nyou're starting to\nhead into territory\nthat can deplete\nyour health, so you\ngot to do a lot of other\nthings to offset it.\nBut they drink a lot.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nthe Brits drink a lot.\nI have spent time over\nthere with my father-in-law,\nmy brother-in-law, and we\ndefinitely drank a lot.\nSo I'm glad I don't live there\nand had to drink with them.\nI'm glad I don't have to\ndrink with them all the time.\nI'd probably be dead.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You were\nstraight edge growing up,\nright?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I\nmean, when I was a kid,\nand then when I joined the\nNavy, I started drinking.\nThat's like part of the\nculture that I bought into.\nAnd I wanted to be\na good SEAL, and I'm\nlooking around at the guys that\nwere considered good SEALs,\noh, so we're drinking?\nOK, that's what we're doing.\nAnd that's what I did.\nLooking back now,\nI didn't really--\nI didn't think of it as\na big deal at the time.\nI wasn't like-- well, first of\nall, even when I was growing up\nand I didn't drink and didn't\nsmoke, didn't do drugs,\nI wasn't like a guy putting an X\non my hand, although my friends\nand I, we all didn't\ndrink, didn't smoke.\nSo we definitely-- look, I\nwas listening to Minor Threat\nwhen I was a kid.\nI mean, I get it, but\nI wasn't I running\naround telling everyone\nI was straight edge,\nbut I was on that path for sure.\nAnd then when I got in the\nSEAL Teams, it's like, OK,\nthis is a different culture.\nI'm not used to it.\nAnd I didn't really even\nunderstand what drinking was.\nI mean, I never had been drunk.\nSo got on the SEAL Team\nso I was like, OK, well,\nonce I turned 21, hey, these\nguys were going to have fun,\nand I kind of just, OK,\nthat's what we're doing,\nand then I drank a ton while\nI was in the SEAL Teams.\nAnd then as I retired from\nthe SEAL Teams and went out,\nwe basically went to every\nbar that we would normally\ngo to like as SEALs.\nI think we closed out the\nnight at the Park Shores in OB.\nAnd when I went\nhome that morning,\nI woke up the next\nmorning, worked out,\nand then I just kind of\nstopped drinking because--\nand now I just\ndefinitely, I mean,\nnow I just don't\nreally drink anymore.\nSo that's that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, when I had\nmy lab in San Diego\nfor five years,\nthat's where my lab\nstarted, I definitely\nsaw a lot of Team guys in bars.\nYou guys would come\nin and take over bars.\nThese were little takeovers.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI wouldn't leave\nbecause I wouldn't like\ngive them the satisfaction\nor me the dissatisfaction, but\nit was a little frustrating.\nYou're in there, you're\nhaving a decent time\nand then just this\nenormous pack of Team guys\ncomes in and sort\nof like, all right,\nmaybe it's time to\nclose out the night.\nI was friends with\nenough of them,\nbut if you're not\nreally a part of it,\nyou're not really a\npart of it, and I always\nknew that and understood that.\nOne thing that I think really\ncomes through now especially\nbut throughout our\ndiscussion and all the things\nI've seen of you,\nand it gets me back\nto this thing that came\nup at the beginning,\nI'd really like to\nreturn to is that you\nseem to have a very strong\nsense of context and self.\nI'll just say it, I'm\nnot a psychologist,\nI'm not here to play\none, but what you just\ndescribed was that\nin one context,\nyou know it made sense\nto be straight edge,\nand you mentioned Minor Threat,\ngreat band, straight edge band,\nbut when it came time to run\naround with your friends then\nand it made sense to be without\nalcohol or drugs or anything\nat that stage and then you\nget into another context,\nit's like OK, I can do this.\nI can drink and still\nperform well and do\nall the things I need to do.\nAnd then when that closes out,\nI'm going to do something else.\nAnd some people are like\nthat because they're\nkind of a chameleon.\nThey're switching themselves\ndepending on the context,\nand they're kind\nof getting accents\nwhen they're in one\nlocation or another,\nbut that's not you at all.\nI can tell with certainty\nthat's not you at all.\nThere seems to be a very\nstrong sense of self\nso that when we have a\nsense of self that's firm,\nwe can go into\ndifferent contexts.\nWe can even change\nour behavior, but we\ndon't lose who we\nare, which means\nwe can always return to it.\nThe image in my\nmind is like I've\ndone a little bit of\nscuba diving, not a lot,\nbut during some of the more\nadvanced training for us,\nthis wasn't SEAL\ntraining, of course,\nwas following a line in the\ndark, like a night dive.\nAnd you're following a\nline, and sometimes you're\nnavigating with tools,\nbut suddenly you're\nfollowing a line underwater.\nAnd this idea that you\ncan let go of that line,\nbut you have to remember where\nit is you can return to it.\nAnd that's kind of how I\nimagine the sense of self\nbecause in different\ncontexts, most healthy people\nmodify themselves a little bit.\nWe act differently at\na wedding or a funeral\nthan we do in class or\nout with our friends.\nOf course, it's\nan important part\nof being a functional human.\nSo it seems to me that\nfrom a pretty early stage,\nyou had a pretty\ngood sense of self.\nNow I don't know if\nyou sit in your room\nand meditate on who is\nJocko Willink and touch\nthat central chord of self.\nI'm guessing you don't.\nBut as I say this,\nI have to ask,\nwas there something in your\nupbringing, your parents\nor was it just kind of how\nyou always imagine yourself is\nlike, yeah, this is who I am.\nNo matter what happens around\nme, I kind of know who I am.\nEven if I'm engaging in\nsome of the behaviors\nthat I might not do\nin another context,\nI know who I am\nbecause I actually\nthink that many people do not\nhave a very firm sense of self,\nor their sense of self is\nso rigid that they can only\noperate in this narrow\ntrench of one domain of life\nand they end up\nvery, very isolated.\nSo I'd love for you to share\nwith us what your recollections\nare like the first time you\nrealized like, yeah, I'm\ngood in a bunch of\ndifferent places.\nI'm safe or I'm whatever,\nbecause I think this is also\nrelates to confidence.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I'm\nglad you are giving me\nthe benefit of the doubt\non going in the Teams\nand being like, oh, hey, man,\nlooks like guys are drinking\nand I haven't\nreally drank before,\nand it seems like these\nguys are having a good time.\nLet's go have a good\ntime with these guys,\nand that's kind of\nwhat I did right.\nAs far as, and I look at it\nnow and unfortunately for me,\nI look at alcohol now as just--\nI've seen it destroy\nso many people\nthat I've now kind of look\nat it and go, man, I don't\nthink people should drink.\nAnd look, I get it.\nI'm kind of an example.\nI used to drink and go\nout and have a good time,\nand it wasn't that\nbig of a deal.\nIt didn't negatively impact\nme in some dramatic way,\nbut I have so many friends\nthat it is horrible for.\nIt is all but\nruined their lives.\nAnd it's totally legal,\nwhich is kind of bizarre.\nSo I think that figuring\nthat out when I look back,\nand the culture in the\nSEAL Teams was very--\nthere was very alcohol centric.\nAnd part of that is because\nit's just like a fraternity is\nalcohol centric,\nor a football team\nis because you got a\nbunch of young dudes\nthat are going to drink\nand have a good time.\nSo it's just sort of a\nyoung dude kind of thing,\nand unfortunately, it ends up\nruining a lot of people's lives\nand they make bad decisions\nand they do stupid things\nand it's just not good.\nAnd I think the culture\nis moving away from that\na little bit in the SEAL Teams.\nMy alcohol brief\nused to say, I used\nto tell my guys if you\ngo out, you get a DUI,\nyou get put in jail\nfor a fight, you\nget hurt because you're\ndoing something drunk,\nyou just did Al\nQaeda's job for them.\nYou just did al-Qaeda's job.\nThey want to take you\noff the battlefield,\nand you just took yourself\noff the battlefield.\nYou can't go on deployment now.\nAnd that would always hit guys.\nAnd I think that\nthat's the SEAL Teams\nkind of leaning in\nthat direction more,\nrealizing the\nnegativity of alcohol.\nI wish I would have\nrealized that earlier.\nI wish I would have\nbeen a better leader\nand recognize that\nin an earlier stage,\nand recognize that just because\nI was kind of getting away\nwith it, meaning I didn't\nwake up in the morning,\noh, man, I can't wait to quit.\nI never really had that feeling.\nI wish I would have realized\nthat there's other guys that\ndo, and there's people that\ncan operate and be functional\nand it doesn't really\nimpact their lives,\nbut there's a lot of\npeople that don't.\nAnd I don't think it's worth\nthe dice roll to start drinking.\nI just don't think it's\nworth the dice for what\ndo you get out of it?\nSo I think that\noverall that's why if--\nwhen I think about alcohol, I\njust think about all the lives\nthat it's ruined,\nand I don't like it.\nAnd I wish I would have\ndone a better job of saying,\nyou know what, this\nis probably not good,\nand we shouldn't do this.\nAnd unfortunately I didn't, and\nI try and convey that message\nas much as I can now.\nAnd it did bring me back to my\nroots because when I was a kid,\nit was like alcohol is weak,\nand you look at these guys,\nthey don't know\nwhat they're doing,\nthey're acting like idiots,\nI'm not going to be like that.\nAnd so as I got older, once\nI got on the SEAL Teams,\nI went back to that.\nAs far as where I became\nme, I just actually\nhave to give a lot of credit\nto the music that I grew up\nlistening to, and the attitude\nthat we had back then listening\nto hardcore music,\nbeing able to stand up\nagainst what other people were\nsaying which is what you're\ndoing when you're in that scene,\nand the whole DIY nature of it.\nHey, we can just\ndo this ourselves.\nWe can just make this\nhappen for ourselves.\nWe don't need anybody else.\nWe can do this.\nAnd that hardcore attitude\nand sticking by your friends\nand standing up and\ngetting in fights\nand that's what you're going to\ndo, that's kind of my attitude.\nAnd I got interviewed\nfor a documentary\nthat they're making about Harley\nFlanagan and the Cro-mags,\nand when I was a kid and\nactually through my whole life,\nthat music is the\nsoundtrack to my life.\nAnd so I always would have\nthat music running in my head.\nBut to your question,\nI had something in me\nthat when I heard that music for\nthe first time, I was like, OK,\nhere it is.\nHere it is.\nI hear the Beatles, I\nhear the Grateful Dead,\nI hear the Rolling\nStones, I hear whoever,\nand you go, OK, that's fine.\nBut when I heard hardcore\nmusic for the first time,\nwhen I heard the Cro-Mags, when\nI heard Agnostic Front, when\nI heard the Bad\nBrains, I thought\nthat was just like it\nwas part of me already.\nAnd then it was the\nattitude, and again you\ncan listen to my podcast\nwith Harley Flanagan,\nthe way I viewed Harley\nFlanagan, the way I\nviewed the Cro-Mags was not\nthe way they actually were.\nI mean, Harley was doing\ndrugs, I mean, horrible drugs.\nHe was on heroin,\neverything else,\nbut his image was like straight\nedge, kind of spiritual,\nthey had all that stuff going\non and I thought, OK, well,\nthat's who they are.\nBut I didn't know,\nI'm like a kid living\nin the woods in\nConnecticut, I'm just\nglad to be hearing\nwhat I'm hearing.\nHe listened to\nthe lyrics, listen\nto the lyrics of Minor\nThreat, listen to the lyrics\nand you go, OK, this stuff,\nI agree with this stuff.\nAnd I just think\nthat that kind of\nset a datum in my head of\nbeing OK with being outside,\nbeing OK with saying no,\nbeing OK with being a rebel,\nbeing OK with not\ngoing along with what\neveryone else is doing.\nAnd that came that became\nvery important when\nI was in the\nmilitary, and I looked\nat what leadership might\nbe telling me to do\nand might think to\nmyself, hey, that\ndoesn't seem like a\ngood idea, and having\nthe wherewithal\nto say, hey, boss,\nI'm not sure this\nis a good idea.\nNot to be a jerk\nabout it, but just\nto say there might be a\nbetter way to get this done.\nWhat do you think of this?\nOr, hey boss can I ask\nyou a question about that?\nSo I think if I had to trace it\nback having Black Flag My War\nside too on my record player\nfor like a year and a half\nstraight, that's going\nto leave a mark, man.\nAnd I think it\nleft a mark on me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love what you\njust said, and when I say love,\nI really mean it\nbecause as we both know\nwe share a common love\nfor certain music,\nin particular Minor Threat and\nsome stuff from the punk rock\nscene.\nIn particular for me, the\nNortheast punk rock scene,\nthe Bruisers, all borrowed from\nthe Bruisers, and now people\nknow him as the lead singer\nfor the Dropkick Murphys.\nBefore that was the Bruisers.\nAnd we run the\nrisk of going deep\ndown a rabbit hole of music\nthat most people may or may not\nbe familiar with,\nalthough most people have\nheard the dropkicks, but yeah,\nI'm right there with you.\nI mean, I remember\nthe first time\nhearing Stiff Little\nFingers or Rancid\nand even Bouncing\nSouls for New Jersey--\nnot even Bouncing Souls.\nSorry.\nSorry.\nSorry, Brian and Greg.\nNo, the Bouncing Souls\nand going, yes, that's me.\nThat's it.\nBut as you said, it\nwas already in you.\nIt's like a recognition,\nand I bring this up,\nand I want to highlight\nit, not because we\nshare this, although I do find\nthat to be an amazing kinship\nthat we felt right away, and\nit was like we probably riffed\nfor 25 hours just on that.\nBut it brings me back\nto this idea that--\ncertainly is not my idea.\nActually the first\ntime I heard about it\nwas from Robert Greene\nwho wrote the book\nMastery, and some important\nwritings, what was it?\nI think it was the--\nI forget how many laws of power,\nbut those books, Robert Green\nMastery is actually a book\nthat I highly recommend.\nPeople read because it talks\nabout mentorship and finding\nmentors and the fact that we're\nsupposed to break up and move\non from mentors, and that\nmentors aren't always people\nthat we know or that\nknow us, et cetera.\nAmazing book, really.\nBut he was the\nfirst person I ever\nheard describe this idea that\nif we think back long enough,\nthere's some seed moment, they\nwere shopping for the pants,\nit sounds like it was, but also\nmusic where you see something\nand it's like, yes,\nthat's me and I'm that.\nAnd then that becomes\na sort of soundtrack\nor visual image or\nsomething for your life\nthat you carry forward with you.\nThe neuroscientist\nin me wants to say\nthat that is the first\ntime that we really\ntap into this dopamine system\nin a way that is unique to us,\nbecause every child\nresponds to food\nwith a little bit of dopamine\nwhen we're hungry, responds\nto warmth when we're cold,\nresponds to a warm dry diaper\nafter we just wet\nourselves, which we all did.\nI don't know maybe, Jocko,\nyou change your own diapers.\n[LAUGHTER]\nBut I'm guessing that\nsomeone changed your diaper\nat one point, not an image\npath we need to go down.\nBut the idea is that we all\nhave these universal sources\nof having our needs met,\ngoing from discomfort\nto comfort and back again,\nwhich is basically childhood.\nBut at some point,\nsomething comes along\nthat we really feel\nis unique to us,\nand it may be the thing\nthat everyone else likes,\nmaybe it's top 40\nor whatever it is.\nMaybe it's the shoe\nthat everyone's\nwearing that seems good.\nBut I do think that there\nare certain people who\nare kind of 10 or 20 or maybe\neven 180 degrees off from what\neveryone else likes and\nthey're like, that thing\nis what's really cool,\nand it's a felt thing.\nAnd so along the lines of felt\nthings as opposed to things\nthat everyone values, what are\nyour sources of motivation.\nAnd I'm going to guess that\nsome of them are internal.\nWe could point ahead or\nwe could point to heart.\nDoesn't really\nmatter, but like when\nyou think of sources\nof motivation,\ndo you have a palette of\nthem that you can dip into?\nDo you even feel the\nneed to dip into them,\nor is it really just\nall about action steps\nthroughout your day?\nOr if I can even venture\ninto somewhat harder stories\nthat I've heard\nyou talk about, do\nyou sometimes\nthink back, listen,\nI'm going to do this because\nthere are a bunch of guys that\nare dead now that\ncan't, and so I'm\ngoing to do it because I can.\nWhat are the paints on your\nmotivation pallet, if you will?\nJOCKO WILLINK:\nWell, you probably\nheard me say that\nmotivation isn't something\nthat I am going to count\non because it's just\nan emotion that's\ngoing to come and go,\nand it's just like\nfeeling happy.\nYou feel happy\nright now, maybe you\nwon't feel happy in 15 minutes.\nYou feel sad now, maybe you\nwon't feel sad in 15 minutes.\nYou feel motivated\nright now, you might not\nfeel motivated in 15 minutes.\nTherefore I can't rely on it.\nSo I'm not going to put any--\nI'm not going to put\nany money on just\nbeing motivated because it\ndoesn't really matter to me.\nSo the daily actions that I\ntake aren't from motivation,\nthey're just from discipline.\nLike I said earlier,\nI'm not going\nto get up and go through\nsome big debate about,\nwell, do I really\nfeel like doing this?\nNo, I don't feel like doing\nit, but doesn't matter,\nso I'm just going to go do it.\nNow if we start to look at a\nbroader movement through life\nand continuing to try and\nmove forward and move on,\nmy buddy Seth died, and he was\nthe Delta Platoon commander\nin tasking a bruiser.\nAnd he died in 2017, and it\nwas in a parachute accident.\nI mean, it's\ndefinitely unexpected,\nand also he'd already been\nthrough multiple deployments,\nwas with me in the\nBattle of Ramadi,\nhe then went back into\nSadr City and led a ton\nof very dangerous operations.\nAnd then he did\nother deployments,\nand was kind of done with his\ndeployments, kind of done.\nAnd now he's just talking about\nwhen he's going to retire,\nand he's a couple of years\naway from retirement,\nand I'm talking\nabout, hey, we're\ngoing to work together again.\nAnd it all seems like\nwe're on a pretty good path\nto just move forward.\nAnd then he ends up dying\nin a parachute accident.\nAnd he's a guy that was\nreally just kind of you're\nnot going to be able to replace.\nThere's a uniqueness to him that\nis you're not going to find,\nand I've got some\nstuff that he wrote.\nHe was an incredible writer,\nand I try and write something\nlike him, and we\ncan't do it because he\nhad a bigger vocabulary and a\nmore articulate way of writing.\nAnd so I can't write anything\nas well as he wrote it.\nHe was incredible at guitar, he\nplayed guitar, played ukulele\nlike sick, like an\nincredible at playing guitar,\nand he's a total\nknuckle dragger.\nLike a total meat\nhead knuckle dragger.\nHis nickname was\nUnfrozen Caveman\nbecause he just look\nlike a big caveman\nand yet he spoke French, and\ncould recite French poetry.\nAnd was really good\nat learning languages,\nand he was an artist,\nand he had-- do\nyou know what synesthesia is?\nDo you know that is?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\nmerging of the senses\nso people that can\nsee colors and--\nJOCKO WILLINK: So he\ndidn't know what it was--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nsorry, see colors.\nI hope most people can\nsee colors-- sorry,\nthat can hear colors and can\nassociate particular colors\nwith sound like particular\nkeys on the piano.\nIt's pretty rare.\nSome people think they have\nit, but true synesthesia\nare pretty rare, but they don't\nhave to fight for this trait.\nIt just kind of\nemerges for them.\nJOCKO WILLINK: He\ndidn't know it.\nBut one day he\nwas talking to me,\nand he was embarrassed\nto tell me.\nHe's like, what's weird is\nwhen I think of numbers,\nI have colors in my head.\nAnd I go, what do you mean?\nAnd he says, hollow was zero,\nand I remember seven is yellow.\nI don't remember any\nof them, but he just\nrattled off like 123456789.\nHe says, hollow, white, clear,\njust rattled off these colors.\nHe had that synesthesia,\nand it gave him\nsome kind of weird ability\nto memorize numbers.\nSo he'd be in a bar and talk\nto some girl and he'd say,\nwhat's your number?\nAnd he would just-- he\nwould know it for two years.\nHe would just know it.\nAnd that also made\nhim incredibly\ngood at playing guitar\nbecause now like the scale\nand the fretboard of a guitar,\nit's a mathematical thing\nthat he has all in this weird\ncoloration scenario going on.\nSo he's this guy and\na very emotional guy.\nA very emotional guy who would--\nI was talking earlier about\nbeing a balance for someone.\nI had to balance this dude out\non a daily basis sometimes.\nHe'd be so mad about something.\nOne day he'd be,\nI hate the Teams.\nI hate all these guys.\nAnd I'd say, yeah,\nI get it, man.\nAnd the next day, I'm never\ngetting out of the Teams.\nHe would oscillate that\nbad, and I would tell him,\nhey, bro, you're\noscillating again,\nand just would do anything.\nAnd he loved these guys and\nwould do anything for his guys.\nAnd so when he died, we're at\nhis-- it's not his funeral,\nit's before the funeral.\nIt's like the open casket\nthing, the wake thing,\nand myself, his brother,\nAlex, Leif Babin who\nI wrote Extreme Ownership\nwith and JP O'Donnell, who's\none of my brothers who works\nwith us at Arsenal on Front\nnow is with us in Ramadi\nand was very close to Seth,\nand everyone kind of\ncleared out for us.\nAnd we go in there, and\nI think JP gave him--\nJP had one of those Memorial\nbracelets with guys' names\non it that had died and\nJP gave that to him.\nAnd I think Leif gave him some\nsurf wax because also Seth\nwas a surfer, and I gave Seth\nhis black belt because he\nstarted training jiu-jitsu with\nme and he had his purple belt.\nHe had gotten his purple belt,\nI gave him his black belt\nand everyone was just quiet.\nAnd JP was telling the\nstory the other day\nand I just said, we\nwill not fail him,\nmeaning that him Mark,\nMikey, Chris, Seth,\nand countless other\nguys they're not here.\nThey don't have the opportunity\nto do the things we do.\nThey don't have the opportunity\nto get up in the morning.\nSo that's what it is, man.\nI won't fail those guys.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thanks\nfor sharing that.\nYeah, thank God.\nAnyone listening\nto this feels what\nI feel right now, which is very\nclear that the depth of emotion\nfor people that we\ncare about and lose\nhas everything to do\nwith our love for them.\nThere's just no\nquestion about it.\nThe grief and love are\nso intimately tied.\nThey are a direct\nreflection of one another.\nAnd I hesitate to kind\nof stay on hard themes,\nbut I think it's really\nimportant for a couple\nof reasons.\nLast time we spoke, it was in\nyour office and your podcast,\nand after we wrapped\nup, we started\ntalking about some\npeople we know\nand some things that had\nhappened in your community,\nand kind of spooled\ninto some discussions\nabout things that happened\nin nearby communities\nand civilian culture.\nAnd one of the things\nthat's so perplexing\nI think to people, including\nme but maybe with time less so,\nand this actually came up last\nnight in a discussion at home\nbecause of some recent events,\nnot close to me, but is\nthat some people go through\nthings where there's loss,\nthey go through life\nand there's hardship.\nI think most people experience\nsome hardship certainly\nsome more than others.\nAnd every once in a while\nand far too often, and even\nin the SEAL Team community, and\neven in the various communities\nwithin the SEAL Team community\nwhere one would never\nexpect it, these are highly\ntrained tight community,\nhard guys, that's the\nlanguage we sometimes hear,\nbut as you point out,\nthese are people often\nthat have tremendous\nemotional depth.\nAnd I'm so glad that you\nbrought that up because I think\nwe sometimes think of emotion as\nweakness, but there was a time,\nnot long ago, 40, 50 years ago,\nwhere emotions like jealousy\nand intensity,\nthink the character\nSonny and the Godfather, he\nwould get so pissed, he would\nbite his own fist, that's\na pretty emotional response\nwhere intensity and emotion were\nkind of interchangeable words\nat some level.\nI'm going to be direct.\nThere have been a lot of guys\ncoming out of the SEAL Teams.\nI've been surprised to\nhear they kill themselves,\nand yesterday there\nwas a major suicide.\nI didn't know this\nguy in person,\nwe actually followed each\nother on social media,\nbut I admittedly was not close\nto him, didn't know him at all.\nIn fact, his name was Twitch or\nsomething, and he was this guy,\nhe was a public facing figure.\nBut listen, happens all\ntoo often, and even happens\nin former operators.\nAnd suicide is something that\nfascinates me and intrigues me\nand scares the hell out of me\nbecause for the life of me,\nI cannot map it to any specific\nthing in the brain or body that\nwe're aware of, and yet I've had\nseveral friends commit suicide,\nhad my undergrad advisor\ncommitted suicide.\nThe point is not\nthem or their story.\nThe point is what in the\nworld dictates whether or not\nsomebody who has a community,\nwho's doing well and then less\nwell decides to offer themselves\nto end their own life,\nversus decide I'm\ngoing to keep going?\nI mean, this is I'm\nraising this as a question.\nI wish I had an answer I used to\nhave ideas like, Oh, it's time\nperception.\nThese people are so miserable,\nfeeling so miserable\nthat they feel it's\ngoing to go on forever.\nBut then you start reading\nthe literature on suicide,\nand I've started\nto go into this.\nFor those of you\nthat can stomach it,\nand I don't know that I\nwant to recommend this movie\nbut I'm just going to say it\nexists, the movie The Bridge\nwhere they fix the camera on the\nGolden Gate Bridge for a year,\nit turns out one person a day\non average tries to jump off.\nThey talk to a guy\nwho survived it.\nBy the way he jumped off the\nmoment he went off there.\nHe thought I wish\nI hadn't done that.\nHe survived.\nThis kid with bipolar.\nBipolar disorder, especially\nmales, 20 to 30 times\nhigher incidents of suicide.\nMassive increase.\nThe point is that\nthere's something\nthat happens in the brain\nwhere somehow people also\nwill get the idea, and you hear\nthis, that this is something\nthey're excited to\ndo, or that they're\ngoing to write the world\nsomehow by doing this,\nor that somehow it's like\na gift to themselves.\nAgain, I'm not encouraging\nanybody to do this.\nI want to be very clear,\nbut these are the things\nthat you hear.\nAnd sadly, your community\nhas lost a number of people\nthrough suicide, and yet there\nare a lot of guys that thrive.\nAnd so more as a\ntemplate for trying\nto understand mental health and\ndepression and suicide, what\nare your thoughts on why\nsome people seem to thrive,\nand some people just\ngo all the way down?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Clearly, that's\na very complex question,\nand there's probably a\nlot of different answers.\nAnd I certainly am not one to\nbe able to answer that question.\nHowever, probably\nwhere my thought\nhas gone on this\nlately because I've\nknown some guys that have\nkilled themselves and I've\nbeen totally shocked, and just\nbeen completely and totally\nshocked that guys that I\nknew killed themselves.\nGuys that you would\nthink, Oh, this guy\nwould never do this\nin a million years.\nAnd that's the feeling I've\nhad about a lot of the guys\nthat I know that have\nkilled themselves.\nI had a woman on my podcast\nnamed Sarah Wilkinson,\nand she's an awesome woman,\nand she was married to a SEAL.\nHis name was Chad.\nI didn't know him.\nHe killed himself.\nAnd to hear her\ndescribe the story,\nthe shocking thing\nabout the story\nis that the guy that she\nknew, the guy that she married\nwas not the same guy\nthat killed himself.\nSomething happened to him that\nmade him a different person.\nAnd look, they're getting\nall this information\nnow about CTE and the brain\ntrauma that you go through,\nand people are exposed to that.\nAnd I think if you've ever\nseen George Foreman, he\nseems totally normal and\ngood to go, and Muhammad Ali,\nnot so much.\nAnd I've known\nfighters, and you can\nlook at any number of boxers\nthat have had a career,\nand some of them are\nfine, and some of them\nhave some real significant--\nwhat is it?\nPugilistic.\nThere's a pugilistic syndrome.\nThey've been punched too\nmuch and they have problems.\nYou can expose different\npeople to blast impact,\nand it's going to have a\ndifferent impact over time.\nAnd I think that, again, to\nhear Sarah explain that story\nand what she saw\nfrom her husband\nand how different\nhe was when they\ngot married compared\nto where they ended up,\nit's totally different.\nA totally different person.\nI had another friend of mine\non who named Marcus Capone,\nand his wife came on with him,\nand she said the same thing.\nThe guy that she married\nwas not the same guy\nthat was ready to kill himself,\nand he didn't, thankfully.\nIt was a different person.\nLook, if Fred is\nmarried to some woman,\nand Fred and Jessica\ngrow apart over time\nand he ends up with some other\ngirl, it's still the same guy.\nit's still the same guy that\nis now, look, they grew apart,\nthey're getting\ndivorced, we get it.\nBut the way that both of\nthem described their husbands\nas being different people.\nThat's what stuck with me\nmore than anything else.\nSo I-- again, I'm\nthrowing this out there\nonly because it's what I've\nobserved through the people\nthat I know, and\nseeing and hearing\nthose stories of people\nbeing totally different.\nAnd I've known a few people--\none of my friends,\nDave, killed himself.\nI never would have\nguessed in a million years\nthat Dave would kill himself.\nIt just it doesn't compute.\nIt doesn't compute.\nAnd so my suspicion is there\nhas to be something going\non mechanically or chemically\nwith the brain that causes them\nto get into a mode\nwhere they're depressed\nand they don't see a\nway out, and that's\nthe way they feel now.\nAnd again, what's\ninteresting about this is\nwe already talked about the\nfact that the selection process\nweeds out guys that are\ngoing to take a loss\nand not be able to get up again.\nNo, you've got--\nSEALS can take a loss\nand get back up again.\nThat's what you learn\nhow to do in bed.\nWell, that's what you-- you\ndon't lean how to do it,\nyou have it.\nAnd if you make it\nthrough that training,\nyou have that ability to\ntake a loss, all right, cool.\nShake it off, get\nback up, keep going.\nThey're going to do that to you.\nSo now you've got guys\nthat are taking a loss\nand they don't see\na way out anymore,\nin fact, to such a\npoint that they're\ngoing to take their\nown lives, it's\nmy suspicion is at some point\nthey're going to figure out\nthat this exposure to the\nadrenaline, the explosions\nall the time--\nI mean, you go out\nto a range-- just\nin peacetime-- you\ngo out to a range,\nand you shoot a Carl Gustav.\nAnd you're a range\nsafety officer,\nso you go out there\nwith every guy that's\nshooting a Carl Gustav, it's\na big, giant, like bazooka\nlooking weapon.\nAnd every time you shoot it, it\nrattles your cage a little bit.\nWell, if you're a range safety\nofficer, and you're out there,\nand you're going to watch\neveryone in the platoon\nshoot three of those, it's\ngoing to have an impact.\nThen you go overseas,\nand you're a breacher,\nor you're part of\na breach team--\nI mean, I had a time\nwhere one of my guys\nwere doing an assault\non a compound.\nI'm on the ladder--\nmost buildings in Iraq\nhave a wall around them.\nSo the way we would conduct\nthese raids, put the ladder up,\nthe assault--\nbreach team would\nclimb over the ladder,\nand I would go right\nbehind the breach team,\nand I would stand on the ladder.\nSo I'm looking at the\nbuilding, observing,\nmaking sure there's\nno waking up,\nmake sure there's no threats.\nAnd then as I'm watching,\nthis guy in particular,\nhe puts the breach on the\ndoor, explosive breach,\nso he's going to\nblow the door up.\nHe's got his little\nteam with him.\nHe puts the breach on the door.\nHe starts to back away, and\nthere's like an obstacle there.\nIt was like a freaking table,\nor a lawn chair, or something.\nAnd he couldn't get around it.\nAnd I'm sitting there.\nIt's dark.\nI mean, it's the\nmiddle of the night.\nIt's 2:00 o'clock\nin the morning.\nAnd I'm like, I wonder\nwhat he's going to do.\nAnd he seem stuck for a second.\nAnd then I just\nsee him lay down.\nAnd I'm like oh, he's just\ngoing to take this thing.\nAnd sure enough, three\nor four feet away\nfrom this breech point, he\nlays down and just clacks off\nthis explosive charge.\nAnd I jump over the wall.\nAnd as I'm going in, I'm trying\nto get the rest of the platoon\nto go and commence this\nassault. I look at him,\nhe looked like he just\ngot hit in the head\nwith a baseball bat.\nAnd guess what he\ndid the next night?\nAnother breach on\nanother target.\nGuess what he did\nthe next night?\nAnother breach on\nanother target.\nSo you get guys that have\nthat exposure, which is--\nI mean, every seal\nis eating a breach.\nI mean, you're\neating flashbangs,\nyou're eating breaches,\nyou're shooting 50 cals.\nYou're eating some\ntraumatic brain injury.\nBut then you must\nhave some people\nthat have some\ngenetic propensity\nto have this negative\nthing happen.\nAnd I can only\nguess, man, that this\nhas something to do with\nit because otherwise, we\nwouldn't be hearing so\nmany of these stories.\nAnd of course, we're just\ntalking about the SEAL Teams.\nWe're not talking about the\nmilitary writ large, which\nis in the same exact boat.\nI'm also nervous about the\nsocial contagion of suicide\nwithin the veteran community.\nI'm nervous about that.\nIt's one of the\nthings that makes\nme apprehensive about\ntalking about it,\nbut I obviously I've\ntalked about it.\nI've had people on my podcast\nto discuss these things,\nbut I am worried about that\nsocial contagion of man,\nFred did it.\nHe got all this attention,\nand he doesn't have\nto deal with anything anymore.\nI'm going to do it too.\nThere's got to be some level\nof that going on as well.\nSo it's a horrible situation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nthe social contagion part\nis one that hits home from\na different dimension.\nThe high school I\nwent to which is--\nname isn't important.\nBut Gunn High School, G-U-N-N.\nGunn High School is famous\nfor being one of the\nbetter public high schools.\nNot that I attended as\nmuch as I should have.\nI can tell you more about\nthe curbs in the parking lot\nthan I could tell you\nabout the classes I took.\nAnd that's just not\nencouraging people\nto not attend high school.\nPlease do it.\nTook a lot of really hard\nwork to climb back up\nto where I should have\nbeen when I graduated.\nBut it has an\ninfamous reputation,\nor I'll say reputation\nas an infamous school\nbecause it's one of the\nhighest suicide rates than any\nof the schools in the\ncountry because there's\ntrain tracks that\nrun through town,\nand there was a contagion\nof kids throwing themselves\non the train tracks.\nThis was happening a lot.\nThis was written up in\nvarious newspapers, et cetera.\nFortunately, it seems\nto have died down.\nAgain, I'm also hesitant\nto talk about this\nbecause no one\nwants to spark this.\nBut there does seem to be\nsomething about lack of ability\nto see into a future obviously.\nOr the future that\npeople are seeing into\nis so dark that somehow they\nlose touch with the idea\nthat emotions come and go.\nYou said it about motivation,\nemotions come and go.\nBut somehow people\nlose touch with that.\nAnd then I will venture a guess.\nAnd here I'm hoping someone's\ngoing to figure this out\nat some point so\nwe can have a more\nconcrete conversation\nabout the mechanisms\nand what to do about it.\nBut I think there's also\nsomething about identity,\nabout loss of a place\nto put one's energy.\nSomething useful in the world.\nIf you're agenda-- what\nyou're talking about here\nare guys that are generators.\nThey are not projectors,\nthey're generators.\nThey live to have effective\naction on the world for good\nand then end up\nkilling themselves.\nIn youth, it's a little more\ncomplicated to put a finger\non because what's\ngoing on there.\nWe assume depression.\nBut then in learning\nmore about suicide,\nthere is also this\nexcitement for certain people\nabout solving\nsomething that seemed\nunsolvable any other way.\nAnd again, I'm certainly\nnot encouraging this.\nI-- strongly discouraging people\nfrom taking their own life,\nobviously.\nBut something about time and the\nloss of perception about time.\nAnd one thing that\nwe know for sure here\nwe can really hang\nour hat on something\nis that if you do the forensics\non somebody that was suicidal,\nattempted, or took their\nlife, in the preceding\ndays and weeks, their sleep-wake\nschedule was completely wacked.\nThey exit the normal\nroutine of most people.\nThey isolate through\ninversions of time.\nAnd I do wonder\nsometimes whether or not\nthe vampire ships,\nas they're sometimes\ncalled, the\nnighttime deployment,\nand the back and\nforth, I mean, that's\na lot for a system to take.\nShift workers kill themselves\nfar more than nonshift workers.\nSo I do think there's\nsomething there.\nAnd again, I'm not\nsaying everyone needs\nto be in bed by\n9:00 and up by 4:00.\nAlthough that would be a great\nschedule for most people.\nBut I do think that there are\nsome universal laws of what\nmakes the human body\nand brain healthy.\nAnd if you violate\nthose laws long enough\nwith CTE, or with disruption\nin your schedules,\nyou run the risk, especially if\nthere's a predisposition there.\nAnd then other factors\nstart to layer in.\nAgain-- and I have to\napologize because I\ndon't have any real answers,\nor more biology, or psychology\nto firmly throw out\nthis except the warning\nfor people who are bipolar or\nknow somebody with bipolar.\nThey are 20 to 30 times more\nlikely to kill themselves.\nAnd males in particular\nare more likely to use\nmethods that will kill them\nin the first time as opposed\nto survive.\nThere's a big sex\ndifference there.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nYou throw alcohol in there too.\nAnd Marcus is running\nan organization now\nwhere they're taking vets\ndown to do the psychedelic--\nwhat do they call it?\nA journey.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nthis is Veterans Solutions?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They\nare a great organization.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I\nshould mention a very\nbipartisan organization.\nI attended one\nevent on Coronado.\nAnd there were people\nfrom the far-left,\nthe far-right politicians,\nand everything\nin between talking about\nhow critical this is.\nSo this is not a\npolitical issue.\nThis is a mental health issue.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, and even\nwhen I reflected on Marcus\ntalking to me, he\nwas talking about how\nhe's in this downward spiral.\nPart of the downward spiral,\nhe was drinking every day.\nAnd I'm thinking to\nmyself, man, like--\nI didn't think of\nit during the show.\nI was thinking\nabout it afterwards.\nI was thinking, man, if\nyou're drinking all the time,\nyou're on a downward spiral.\nThat's one thing you\nshould just stop.\nLet's stop that immediately.\nSo I just wanted to\nthrow that out there.\nI think that's another sign\nfrom the outside looking in.\nIf someone's self-medicating\nwith alcohol,\nit's not a good place,\nnot a good place.\nThey're not in a good place,\nand they could probably\nuse some help.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I appreciate\nyou saying it again.\nWe did this episode on alcohol.\nI went into it\ntotally open minded.\nI've never been a big drinker.\nI've had it.\nI can drink or not drink.\nI was never really\ninto drugs at all.\nDabbled a little bit\nwhen I was younger.\nI regret it frankly.\nBrain is plastic early\non, I didn't need that.\nNever did hard drugs.\nNever touched cocaine,\namphetamine, or anything\nlike that.\nAnd if I had, I would say.\nI'm comfortable enough in my\nposition in life that if I had,\nI'd certainly say.\nBut I think that it's pretty\nclear that alcohol is bad\nfor us certainly past a\ncertain two drink a week limit.\nPeople especially with a\npropensity for alcoholism\nor who are dealing with other\nissues, that's especially\nthe case for not drinking.\nAnd I guess we've gotten into\nsome hard territory here.\nBut I think if this\nconversation cues up\nan awareness to anybody,\nwhich I hope it would,\neither people that are in\nthat space of wondering\nif they should continue or not,\nor that know somebody who might\nbe, I do think that the\ntakeaway is very clear,\nwhich is that there are\nways to avoid these traps\nand to avoid making\nthese traps worse.\nAnd I think with regular\nsleep-wake schedules,\nunderstanding that--\nand I wrote this down\nthat you've particular have\nsaid several times that\nrather than looking for sources\nof things outside like a job,\nor a relationship,\nwhich are all great.\nBut as sources of energy, or\nmotivation, or inspiration,\nto use positive action\nas a source of energy.\nI think is just--\nif I could put that up on a\nbillboard in Times Square,\nI would.\nAnd I'd put your\nname next to it,\nwhich is that positive\naction is a source of energy\nthat then you can\nrecycle into more things.\nI think--\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --going back\nto the fundamentals, right?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nAnd positive action is when you\nhave to contend with something.\nWhen there's something that\nyou're afraid of, step into it,\nmove towards it.\nThat's how you're going\nto solve that problem.\nYou don't you don't\nsolve problems\nby running away from them.\nYou solve them by\nmoving towards them\nand figuring out\nwhat's going on.\nAnd I mean, alcohol is\nobviously a clear way\nto avoid the problem at least\nfor the next four hours.\nAnd you wake up, and that\nproblem is still there.\nAnd that's not good.\nBut when you've got some\nproblem-- and listen,\nthen we could go\ndown the whole path\nof talking about the\nindirect approach, which\nis a theory of combat which\nI completely believe in.\nBut it also applies to\ninteracting with other people.\nIf you have a problem with\nsome other person, to think,\noh, I got a problem with Andrew.\nI'm going to go\nconfront him on it.\nAnd that might not\nbe the best solution.\nIn fact, it's probably\nnot the best solution\nfor me to go confront\nyou with the problem\nbecause now we're going\nto have a confrontation.\nIt might be better for me\nto take an indirect approach\nand not confront\nyou but instead,\nengage in a\nconversation with you\nabout something that's maybe\nadjacent to the problem\nthat I have.\nAnd then eventually that\nbuilds our relationship\nto a point where you\nstart to recognize,\noh, I bet Jocko feels\nsomething about this thing.\nAnd we can move towards a\nsolution instead of me trying\nto punch you in the\nface with some truth\nthat I believe versus the\ntruth that you believe.\nAnd now we're engaged in\ncombat, and that's bad.\nThere's going to be casualties.\nI'd rather take an\nindirect approach\nand build a relationship\nwhere we can solve problems\nin a more positive way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.\nAnd I love it because\nit really speaks\nto the power of thinking\ncarefully and being\npatient and a little\nbit slower at times.\nI also heard you say\nsomething earlier that's\nstill flagging in my mind,\nwhich is not thinking too much.\nI think seems to be a time\nwhere thinking too much\nis very dangerous.\nAnd again, we can\nkeep the discussion\nthat we were having\nabout mental health,\nor we could even just call it\nwhat it is, mental illness.\nI think everyone would agree\nsuicide is some reflection\nof an unhealthy state.\nWe can keep that in the\nbackdrop as we talk about this,\nbut this isn't necessarily\nonly about that.\nYou seem to have an\nability to engage in things\nwithout thinking too much.\nAnd yet also to sit back\nand be pretty observant.\nAnd you've talked about\nthird personing of the self.\nI'd love to talk a little\nbit more about this\neven though it's a topic\nyou've delved into before.\nAnd in particular the\ntopic of meditation.\nI've been reading\nmore about meditation.\nI've meditated for different\nstretches in my life,\ndifferent amounts of time.\nAnd there are two basic\nforms of meditation\nthat I only recently\nlearned about.\nOne is a focused\nattention meditation.\nYour sitting, closing your eyes,\nfocusing on your breath, body,\nbody surface, or\neven a visual target\nin your environment\nand just focus.\nAnd we know that enhances\none's ability to focus.\nIf you do too late\nin the day, it also\nenhance your ability\nto not fall asleep.\nA lot of people don't realize\nthat meditation too late\nin the day, if it's\na focused meditation,\nyou're just ramping\nup the activity\nin the prefrontal cortex.\nIt's a great tool for\ngetting better at focusing.\nBut then there's also\nthis type of meditation\ncalled open observer meditation\nwhere you purposefully\ndon't include a target in\nyour mind, or in your vision,\nor in your hearing.\nAnd you just sit there, eyes\nclosed, your eyes open, and you\ngo into a place of\nwhatever comes up,\nbut you don't hover\nthere too long.\nThe goal is to not\nhover on any one thing,\nwhich sounds like deliberate\nattention deficit disorder.\nBut it's actually a\npretty cool method\nit turns out for\nrestoring our ability\nto engage in focus but also\nfor one particular thing\nthat you mentioned earlier,\nwhich is creativity\nand creative problem solving,\nwhich of course, requires\naccessing, let's\njust say, more colors\non the palette than\nyour vision might be on.\nRealizing, oh, there's\nalso all these other colors\nover here in the\nperiphery that I'm missing\nbecause I'm hyperfocused.\nDo you meditate?\nIf you do meditate, is it\nmore of an open monitoring\nor a focused meditation?\nAnd if you don't do a\nstandard meditation,\nare there times throughout\nyour day, and your routine,\nand your week where as\nI'm describing this,\nit maps to something that\nfeels like open monitoring\nor focused meditation?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, so\nno, I don't meditate.\nI haven't ever.\nI don't think I've\never actually meditated\nfor one second in my life.\nAnd I--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd I refuse to.\nJOCKO WILLINK: --no, no,\nit's not that at all.\nI know Sam Harris\nsent me his app,\nand we were going\nto do a podcast.\nAnd I said, dude, I'll\ndo it for two weeks,\nand we'll do a podcast, and\nI'll be more enlightened\nand everything.\nAnd I didn't even give\nSam Harris two weeks.\nSo I still owe Sam Harris two\nweeks on his app of meditation\nso we can see how it impacts me.\nBut no I've never\ndone it before.\nI've never tried to do it.\nAnd that being\nsaid, if the goal is\nto take a step back and\ndetach from what's going on,\nI do that all day, every day.\nAnd so that is something\nthat I've talked about,\nand it's something\nI tried to teach.\nI tried to teach the\nyoung SEAL leaders not\nto get caught up in\nwhat's happening right\nin front of them\nbut to take a step\nback, detach from the situation,\ndetach from their emotions.\nSee more of what's happening.\nYou're talking about seeing\nmore colors of the palette,\nwell, on the battlefield,\nI want people\nto be able to see more\nangles, more maneuvers, more\nopportunities, more of\nwhat the enemy might do,\nmore perspective.\nThat's what I always\ntry to achieve.\nAnd so I'm sorry, I\napologize, I can't give you\nany good discussion\non meditation\nbecause I haven't tried it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No\napology necessary.\nBut I will ask,\nwhen you go surfing,\nand you're sitting in the\nwater waiting for a wave,\nare you focused on one\nparticular location\non the horizon, or are\nyou in open monitoring,\njust enjoying just bouncing\nup and down in the water.\nLike where is your attention\nduring activities like that?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nSo surfing-- oftentimes\nsurfing, you're a monkey mind,\nand you're just not\nthinking about anything.\nSame thing with jujitsu.\nAlso with surfing, if\nyou're waiting for a wave,\nyour mind is just going.\nI mean, it's in another\nuniverse sometimes as you're\nsitting there waiting because\nyou're just looking out\nat the horizon.\nAnd your mind-- I mean, my mind,\nI'm thinking about all kinds--\nI have to come home\nsometimes and write notes\nbecause I thought of this,\nI thought of an idea,\nI thought of a perspective.\nThat happens to me at jujitsu.\nThat happens to me talking\nto people where someone's\ntalking about something,\nI'm like oh, I\ngot an idea right now.\nI would go write that down.\nI have to go and write it down.\nI have notes in my phone\nlike pages and pages\nand pages of notes in my\nphone of ideas that I have,\nand I write them down.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\nvoice memo things or do--\nJOCKO WILLINK: No, I type them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --yeah.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I only need\nto type like seven words on\nand then I have the\nwhole ideas in my head.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I put a lot\ninto the notes in my phone\nas well.\nAnd it probably looks like\ngibberish to a lot of people.\nI go back through them when\nI'm on the plane, especially\nproblems I was challenged with\n10 years ago or something.\nAnd I look like, oh,\nmy God, I'm dealing\nwith the same thing, different\nsituation, same me, right?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We had\nan amazing psychiatrist\non the show, but I'd love\nto hear a conversation\nbetween the two of you.\nHis name is Paul Conti.\nHe was trained at\nStanford and Harvard.\nHe's an amazing guy.\nActually, talks openly\nabout the tragedy\nthat his brother killed\nhimself, which was\nwhat drove him into psychiatry.\nAnd he's an interesting guy\nbecause he's obviously highly\neducated, incredibly smart.\nHe wrote a book on trauma, but\nhe has incredible knowledge\nabout a number of other\nareas of psychology,\nincluding narcissism,\nsociopathy.\nHe's worked in a lot of\nreally interesting domains\nwith interesting people\nthat everyone listening\non his podcast would recognize.\nOf course, he's not going to\nreveal who those people are.\nAnd he talks about\nthe fact that you\ncan look at different people.\nHe was actually the one that\nshared with me this notion\nof generators and\nprojectors, and directed me\ntowards that literature.\nBut when he came\non the podcast, he\ntalked a little bit\nabout that stuff,\nbut he talked\nmostly about trauma.\nBut then we were\ntalking about ways\nin which people engage in the\nworld and different archetypes.\nAnd how you start looking at\nstories throughout history,\nand you start seeing the\nsame themes over and over.\nWesterns, this\nidea of a guy rides\ninto town and does\nsome repair work like\ndefeats the sinister\nperson or things\nthat are imposing all the time\nthen rides to the next town.\nIt's always like it ends with--\nit's going to keep continuing.\nBut then when he got into this\ndiscussion of relationship,\nhe talks about-- he said this\non the podcast of a patient who\nsaid, I've been in 10\nabusive relationships.\nAnd he'd say to that\npatient, no, you've\nbeen in one relationship 10\ntimes, which is essentially\nit's all about your issue.\nThat's not you.\nI'm not-- purposely didn't point\nat you for those listening.\nAnd I think that those\nfeatures of ourselves\nthat we bring from condition\nto condition can be negative\nor they can be positive.\nOne thing that's\ninteresting-- and here I'm\nnot trying to solve or\nunderstand the SEAL team\ncommunity per se, but\nI think they represent\nan important archetype\nbecause they are selected\nfor this ability to take\nhard conditions and failures\nand turn them into wins.\nThat's one of the selection\ncriteria, seems to be.\nThey're finding who\nhas that capability.\nI see a lot of-- and I happen to\nknow a few people from the SEAL\nTeams who get out\nand do really well.\nThey have great business.\nYou're a shining\nexample of this.\nAnd you have a\nfamily, and you know\nyou've got German shepherd too.\nWe'll talk about\nanimals in a little bit.\nYou have a dog.\nAnd it's like you\nsurf, and you train.\nAnd I'm sure you have your\ndark places, dark moments\nand challenges\nlike anybody else,\nbut things look to me like\nthey're going pretty well.\nAnd then I also know\npeople from the SEAL Teams.\nOK, they don't go down the\npath of suicide fortunately.\nBut it's they don't do as\nwell as I would have thought.\nAnd I'm certainly not\npicking on this community.\nI also see this from people\nwho are professional athletes.\nI know kids that were\nphenomenal in high school.\nI mean, these are\nlike early admission\nto all the Ivy League\nschools because that\nwas what happened in the\ntown that I grew up in.\nAnd I look at them now, and\nI'm like, wow, That-- gosh,\nit didn't-- somehow\nit's not working out.\nAnd I think it's\nimportant for people\nto hear that yes, winning\ncreates the propensity for more\nwinning.\nBut then why do you think\nit is that in a community\nwhere people are trained to\nsolve problems, adapt, and make\nthings work, some people\nflourish outside the military,\nand some flourish\nless, and some--\nwe already talked about--\nreally go down the dark traps.\nWhat do you think is\nthe quality that allows\npeople to be really adaptable?\nIn particular, because most\nof us live in a landscape\nwhere we have to deal with\npeople who are not us.\nLike people that are not\ngood at what we're good at.\nAnd sometimes that's an\nasset, sometimes it's not.\nYou seem to be particularly\ngood at understanding\nthe human animal and\nworking with that.\nSo again, this is\na broad question.\nWe're going very broadband here,\nand we'll get narrower again\nin a little bit.\nBut I'd love your\nthoughts on why is it?\nHow is it?\nWhat determines\nwhether or not somebody\nthrives in novel environments?\nJOCKO WILLINK: I have\nto start off just\nby saying I wrote a note\nas you were talking.\nI just put SEAL and then\nI put the not equals sign.\nBecause you can't say that\na SEAL equals anything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nExcellent point.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I\nmean, there's guys\nthat have been in the SEAL\nTeams that are murderers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Like\nreal life murderers.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Like murderers.\nLike rapists and murderers that\nwent through SEAL training.\nRapists, murderers,\nand they're in prison\nfor the rest of their lives.\nLike that's a thing.\nThere's people that have been in\nthe SEAL Teams that got kicked\nout of SEAL Teams for drugs.\nI mean, you name it,\nand we've got that.\nAnd we've got guys that are just\nlazy, and we've got guys that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd physicians-- you\ncould say this about physicians.\nThere have been sociopathic\nserial killer physicians\nand then there are ones that\nare in third world countries\nright now that would not\naccept $1,000,000,000 to stop\nserving people at the\nlevel of the basic medicine\nthat they deserve.\nJOCKO WILLINK: So\nthere's the seals\nthat get out and just volunteer\nto go help in the worst\nplaces in the world.\nSo you've got a full\nspectrum of people.\nSo to say a SEAL equals\nsuccess in any domain,\nthe only domain you can\nsay that they're successful\nis they made it through\nbasic SEAL training\nbecause guys make it\nthrough basic SEAL training,\nand they're not good SEALs.\nThat happens.\nSo you get guys that make it\nthrough basic SEAL training,\nand they make it through\nSEAL qualification training,\nand they make it to\na SEAL team, and they\nget kicked out of the SEAL Teams\nbecause they're not good SEALs.\nThey weren't meant\nto do that job.\nThat happens.\nSo all they've proven by making\nit through basic SEAL training\nis they can suck\nit up for a while.\nAnd there's also guys that make\nit through basic SEAL training\nbecause they learned how to\nmaneuver through the system.\nThey learned what\nto do, and what\nthe minimum requirements\nwere, and how\nthey could skate through this.\nThere's guys like that.\nIt's not a huge number, but\nthey're absolutely there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We\nsee them in science.\nPeople that go to a lab, figure\nout who the director of the lab\nis at the level of psychology--\nand this is actually\none of the more dangerous\naspects of science.\nIt actually negatively\nimpacts all of society.\nI'll just say it.\nAnd any scientist will know\nwhat I'm talking about.\nThey find the big famous\nlabs, they figure out\nwho that leader of the\nlab is, and they get\nthat person the data they want.\nThey might not make the data\nup, but they will certainly\ndiscard the data\nthat don't fit, which\nis one way of making\ndata up by exclusion.\nIt's not literally like\npainting pictures of cells\nthat aren't there or something.\nBut that happens a lot, and\nthose people often go far.\nThey rarely go all the\nway because pretty soon\ntheir reputation\nexpands to the point\nwhere people go like, yeah,\nno one can repeat that result.\nBut these people sit\nin very high positions.\nNot at Stanford.\nI will say, I don't know\nany of my colleagues\nat Stanford that\nmeet those criteria.\nBut you see them, and you\nsee what they're doing,\nand they're basically solving\na social engineering thing.\nThey just happen to be\ndoing it in science.\nNow, why anyone would\ndo that in science?\nI don't know because you\ndon't get rich in science.\nYou certainly don't get famous.\nBut for whatever\nreason, they figured it\nout that that's where\nthey're going to do it.\nAnd I'm sure you\nsee it in law firms.\nI'm sure you see it in\nevery single domain--\nJOCKO WILLINK: Everything\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Now,\nyou pointed out\nthat there's some people that\nmake it to the Ivy League\nschools, and they graduate\nfrom an Ivy League school,\nand they don't do well.\nAnd to me, that's very similar\nto someone that might make it\nto the SEAL Teams, do\nwell in the SEAL Teams,\nand then they get out,\nand they don't do well.\nIt's probably because of what\nI talked about earlier when\nI went to Navy boot camp.\nHere's what you got to do.\nIf you do it well,\nyou'll be rewarded.\nWell, if you're in high school,\nand your mom and dad say, hey,\nif you do good in\nhigh school, you're\ngoing to get into this\nIvy League school,\nand you get into that\nIvy League school.\nAnd here's what you need\nto do in high school,\nyou need to get good grades.\nYou need to be part\nof the Glee club.\nYou need whatever the things\nare that you got to do.\nYou've got to speak\na different language.\nYou've got to go volunteer in\nGuatemala in the summertime.\nYou've got to do these\nthings, and then you'll\nget into the good college.\nOnce you get into\nthe good college,\nyou've got to get this degree.\nOnce you get that degree--\nSo they've had a path laid out\nfor them of boxes to check,\nand they go and check the boxes.\nAnd then when they\nget done, no one\nhas put any more boxes\nout in front of them,\nso they don't know what to do.\nAnd that can certainly happen\nfrom someone in the SEAL Teams,\nor someone in the military\nthat what they've been-- hey,\nthis is your mission.\nThis is what you've got to do.\nHere's what you need\nto do, do it well.\nCheck the box.\nCheck the box.\nCheck the box.\nCheck the box.\nAnd then it's time to retire,\nand there's no one putting\na box in front of him to check.\nAnd so unless someone--\nsome guys get out\nof the SEAL Teams,\nand they go into a big corporate\nstructure, and they kick ass.\nBecause there's someone in\nthe corporate world saying,\nhey, here's what\nyou got to do next.\nAnd they do great.\nAnd that's super good for\nthem, and they actually\nreally like it.\nI was talking to a\nguy the other day.\nHe's like full on\nin a corporation.\nHe's doing a great job.\nHe likes what he's doing.\nIt's awesome.\nBut I think you get some\nguys that they don't really\nhave the open mind to see\nwhere opportunities are.\nAnd one thing that's\nnice about the SEAL Teams\nis there's a lot of--\nyou get a lot of\nfreedom of maneuver.\nYou can really do a lot of\nstuff that you want to do.\nAnd so when they look\nat the corporate world,\nthey don't see that,\nand they think,\noh, I'm not going to do that.\nBut then they're not quite\nsure how to take the next step.\nSo I think that's why you\nmight see some guys that\naren't super successful\nbecause they don't really\nknow what to do.\nAnd they don't really\nhave a mind that's\nopen to look for opportunities.\nAnd also you got some\nguys that success for them\nis they're going to hang\nout with their family,\nand they're going to\nget in good shape,\nand they're going to run some\ntriathlons or compete in--\nwhatever they're going to do,\nthey're going to go do it,\nand that's what they're looking\nto do, which is also awesome.\nGo take time, go enjoy\nyour family, man.\nYou gave enough to your country.\nGo hang out with your kids.\nThat's success as far\nas I'm concerned too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I agree there.\nI know far too\nmany people who are\nsuccessful in their\nprofessional lives\nbut who have very\ndiminished personal lives,\nand it is not a pretty picture.\nYou mentioned the parent driving\nthe kid, do this, do that.\nIn that scenario, I\nsense tons of fear.\nIt's all about not\nbeing a failure.\nIt's not actually about love of\nyour craft or what you enjoy.\nPretty early in\nmy science career,\nI learned that there are certain\npeople are just ambitious.\nThey just like to win.\nAnd I used to joke around.\nIt's not polite,\nbut I used to go,\nwe should all just\ntell that person\nthat the new cool thing\nis trying to understand\nthe biology of like--\nand I would say\nfeces or something.\nAnd they'd probably work on it.\nThey'd be like, yeah, it's\nlike the greatest thing\nbecause they actually don't\ncare what they're working on.\nFor them it's just the hunt.\nAnd I learned that\nactually people like that\ncan serve an important role\nbecause like well, there's\nactually a whole microbiome.\nThere are actually labs\nthat do work on feces,\nso forgive me my colleagues\nthat work on microbiomes.\nBut in all seriousness,\npeople who are just ambitious\ncan be very\neffective because you\nput a problem in front of\nthem, and it's like a dog,\nthey'll just retrieve.\nIt's they're just go.\nAs opposed to love\nof retrieving--\nfor retrieving sake.\nIt's like you give that same\ndog-- the analogy here would\nbe give that same\ndog a high jump,\nand they're into high\njumping, or whatever\nit is, or diving underwater.\nBut I think of people\nmore like animals and more\nlike different dog species.\nLike we-- as your case was\nwith music, particular music,\nand communities, or the example\nof shopping for the pants\nand that experience\nof the first time\nyou tap into something that\nreally feels unique to you.\nYou're like there's\nsomething here.\nTo be able to find work that\nincludes that but also is\nhard and also allows\nyou to evolve over time,\nI mean, I think that's\nthe real gift that I\nthink most people are seeking.\nAnd of course,\nthere's no shortcut\nto that except\nperhaps one, which\nis to be able to sense the\ndifference between ambition.\nAnd there's no\nbetter word for it,\nlet's just call it what\nit is, which is love.\nLike I love this.\nAnd the reason I think\nthat love is so powerful--\nand here I'm sounding\nlike Lex Fridman--\nbut I don't mean\ninterelational love.\nI mean, being able to sense what\nthat feels like is that I do\nbelieve that it allows us to\ntap into an enormous number\nof things that fear alone and\nambition alone and just being\na hard driving person alone\nwill not allow us to tap into.\nThings like\nadaptiveness, creativity.\nAnd I think there's a really\nobvious reason for it, which\nis that the one thing we\nknow about our species\nis that we want to\nmake more of ourselves\nand to take good\ncare of our young.\nWhether or not everyone has\nkids or not is irrelevant.\nThe point is that every species\nnot only wants to do that\nbut need to do that.\nAnd the feeling\nof love is really\nwhat allows us to be adaptable.\nI don't think there's anything\nthat trains up adaptability as\nmuch as being around kids.\nYou just have to be\nadaptable because they're\none moment they're\nup then they're\ndown then they're disappointed.\nAnd you shared a\nreally important story\nabout loss of somebody\nthat clearly you loved\nand that clearly loved the\ncommunity he worked in.\nIt wasn't just that\nyou guys loved him,\nIt's that he loved you guys.\nAnd I think that being able to\ntap into these feelings of love\nfor things, for people,\nand for experiences,\nI think is so critical.\nAnd I don't meditate\nmuch these days,\nbut I have heard of this\nlove and kindness meditation.\nAnd it sounds so soft to me.\nI was thinking like, gosh,\nwhat am I supposed to do?\nThen float like\nlevitate at the end?\nAnd wear a mumu or\nwhatever it's called.\nI don't know what's the thing.\nBut my friend who I'm\nfortunate to call a friend.\nNot trying to name\ndrop here, but I'm\nvery fortunate to call\nRick Rubin, the music\nproducer, a friend.\nAnd he was the one\nwho started turning me\non to different\nforms of meditation,\nthe ones I mentioned before.\nAnd this idea that there\nare forms of meditation\nwhich put us in touch with\nwhat he calls the source.\nNow, this is really\ngetting a little mystical,\nbut I think this all maps\nback to the same thing, which\nis that there are\nsources of dopamine\nand the other\nneurotransmitters in us that\ngive us a super power\nto adapt to anything.\nAnd I think it's at\nleast includes love\nbecause that's the most\nadaptable emotion by definition\nbecause of what's\nrequired for evolution.\nSo the question\ntherefore is, in yourself\nand in your observation of\npeople that you've worked with,\ndid you ever sense that just\nbeing hard driving was great\nbut it was limiting?\nDid you ever sense that\nby liking the people\nyou work with you could perform\nmuch better even if they\nperhaps were not as hard--\nto kind of borrow the common\nparlance around this--\nthey weren't as hard\nas everybody else?\nThat because you\nlike each other so,\nso much that you\ncan do anything?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Well, if you\nhave a team of 10 people,\nand you all have a\ngreat relationship\nand you get along well, and\nyou're going against my team\nand we all hate each\nother, who's going to win?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The team\nthat loves each other\nis going to win, I would hope.\nJOCKO WILLINK: It's\nnot even close.\nIt's not even--\na matter of fact,\nif you work for me\nand you don't like me,\nwhat performance are\nyou going to give me?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\ngoing to be tough.\nJOCKO WILLINK: What\nif you love me,\nand I've looked out for you, and\nI've done everything for you,\nand I've taken care of you,\nwhat kind of performance\nare you going to give me?\nEverything you've got.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'd die for you.\nJOCKO WILLINK: So\nyeah, earlier you\nasked about the human\nanimal and human nature.\nAnd this is part of leadership.\nI got asked this question\nthe other day by--\nI was working with a company.\nAnd the guy says,\nhow do I identify--\nwhat are the characteristics\nof someone that can execute,\nand how do I identify those\ncharacteristics in a person\nso that I can get those people?\nAnd I said, well, first of\nall, the characteristics\nare the characteristics that\neverybody is-- obviously,\nsomeone that's driven, someone\nthat communicates well,\nsomeone that's going\nto make things happen,\nthose are pretty simple to know.\nWe know what they are.\nHow do you identify them?\nIt's pretty simple as well.\nI give you a task.\nI give Andrew a task.\nIt's pretty simple task.\nIf you get it done, cool.\nGive you a little bit\nmore complex task.\nDo you get it done?\nYes.\nI give the same task to\nFred, he doesn't get it done.\nHe comes back with a\nbunch of questions.\nHe slow rolls it.\nHe's got all kinds of\nexcuses and problems.\nI give you an even\nmore complex task,\nyou come back, you get it done.\nAnd then I'm going\nto realize, OK,\nAndrew is the guy that\nmakes things happen.\nHe's a guy that can\nactually execute.\nA little bit what you said.\nI mean, there are certain breeds\nof dogs but even that is--\nthey're not as different\nas human beings are.\nAnd there are-- so now\nthere are some guys--\nI've got Andrew who\nwill make things happen.\nHere's the problem with Andrew.\nWhen I say, hey, Andrew, here's\nthis nebulous idea that I have.\nCan you turn this\ninto a reality?\nAnd you're like,\nwhere do I start?\nI'm not sure where\nyou want me to go.\nMeanwhile, I gave\nit to the guy that\ndidn't make anything happen with\nspecific tasks that I gave him.\nAnd he comes back and says--\nI said, hey, I got\nthis nebulous idea.\nCan you see-- he goes, oh yeah.\nAnd all of a\nsudden, he takes it.\nHe says, hey, I figured out\na way to make this happen.\nSo you might have someone\nthat's very good at executing,\nbut they're not very creative.\nI might have somebody\nthat's very creative,\nbut they're not very\ngood at executing.\nSo what do I do?\nI build a team where\nI've got Andrew and Fred,\nand they work together.\nAnd Fred comes up\nwith good ideas,\nand we bring them to Andrew, and\nAndrew goes and executes them.\nSo that's what we're\ndoing from a leadership\nperspective is we're letting\npeople's nature execute.\nWe're putting people\ninto roles where\ntheir nature is beneficial.\nI'm not going to take someone\nthat's shy and introverted\nand put them out in\na lead sales role.\nI'm not going to\ntake somebody that's\nboisterous and extroverted\nand put them into a cubicle\nwhere they're\ngoing to be looking\nat spreadsheets all day.\nClearly, I'm not\ngoing to do that.\nSo what we have to\ndo as leaders is\nwe have to find the right\npeople for the right role,\nand we place them\ninto those roles.\nNow, does it mean\nthat I abandon all\nhope that the guy\nthat's an introvert\nwill ever develop more\ncommunication skills?\nNo, I'm still going\nto work with him.\nAnd over time, we'll\nget him a little bit\nmoving in the right direction.\nBut I'm not going\nto take somebody\nthat's a total\nintrovert and turn them\ninto a lead sales guy.\nThat's not going\nto happen anymore\nthan I'm going to change\na tiger's stripes.\nSo that's what we have to do\nis we have to help people--\nas leaders, we have to\nhelp people find the role\nand find the thing\nthat they're good at.\nNow, does that mean if I have\nsomeone that loves their job,\nthey're going to\ndo better at it?\nAbsolutely.\nDoes it mean that\nif I have somebody\nthat's driven just\nby achievement\nthat they're going to\nbe good at their job?\nNo.\nIn fact, well, they can be.\nThere's going to be certain\nroles I can put them in.\nIf I've got a sales\nnumber I need to hit\nand Andrew is super\ninto achievement,\nhe wants to be the\ngolden child, he\nwants to have his\npicture on the magazine\nthat we put out about\nour industry, cool.\nI can throw this task\nat you, and you're\ngoing to go and get it.\nThe problem is if\nthere's something that's\ngoing to take more perseverance\nand the reward isn't that high,\nor it's a long-term\ngoal, you're probably not\nthe right guy for the job.\nSo liking your job is\nabsolutely critical.\nAnd if you love your\njob, you're going\nto be able to most\nlikely excel at it.\nNow, you could be an unfortunate\nperson that loves your job\nand is not good at it.\nThat happens occasionally.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, but it seems--\nJOCKO WILLINK: It's like--\nsure reminds me of your--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nit seems pretty rare.\nJOCKO WILLINK: It reminds me\nof your skateboarding career.\nYou loved skateboarding, but you\njust weren't that good at it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nwasn't that good at it.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Unfortunately.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You what I\nloved more than skateboarding?\nI loved the community I was in.\nI loved the community I was in.\nAnd I probably would have\ngone to the industry side,\nor worked on a company\nside and not been\non the actual skateboard side,\nor just skateboard for fun.\nSo there's a guy in the\nskateboarding community.\nHis name is Jim Thiebaud.\nAnd he's the not-so-hidden\nsecret in that community.\nHe's an amazing guy.\nAnd he early on left\nprofessional skateboarding\nto run a company, Real, Deluxe,\na bunch of other companies.\nHe's an amazing guy.\nAnd he told me--\nwe've become friends\nrecently-- and he\nsaid he realized he wasn't\ngoing to be one of the big guys,\nbut he knew he wanted\nto be in this community,\nso he found his place.\nAnd I think everyone\nin skateboarding\nlooks to Jim as like the guy.\nHe truly cares about the\nsport and about the people.\nAnd so he learned to\njust wrap his arms\nand his heart around the whole\nthing, and it just works.\nAnd so I do think everyone has\na certain place in a community\nor in a team.\nI think that as you're\ndescribing this,\nI have to imagine that people\nare listening and thinking,\nwow, this team thing is awesome.\nIt's just amazing.\nI wish I had that.\nI'm fortunate to have\nthat in my podcast.\nI've had that in my lab.\nCertainly, in my\npodcast team, I always\nsay, these guys go, I go.\nIt's not just people that press\nbuttons, and run equipment,\ntake photos.\nThey go, I go.\nThey go, it's over.\nAnd I'm fine with that.\nI actually love that\nbecause yes, it's\nabout the podcast and\nabout the information\nand getting it out there, but\nit's as much about the team\nand working together just like\nit was with skateboarding.\nSo hopefully, I'm\nbetter at podcasting\nthan I was at skateboarding.\nI kept getting broke off\nas the skateboarders say\nin skateboarding too often.\nBut I want to ask\nin your family life,\ndo you look at that as a team?\nDo you think this is my\nteam, and they're different\nand how can we synergize?\nJOCKO WILLINK:\nYeah, and you've got\nto look at every team like that.\nWhat are the strengths and\nweaknesses of the team?\nAnd who's going to\nbe good at what?\nAnd how do you put people\nin positions where they're\ngoing to be able to excel?\nI mean, what's his\nname, Thiebaud?\nIs that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Jim Thiebaud.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Jim Thiebaud?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Imagine if he\nhad a mentor that was saying,\nlisten, you got to\nbe a pro skater.\nThis is your only opportunity.\nThere's nothing else.\nAnd he didn't have the ability\nto take a step back and say,\nyou know what, man, I'm not\ngoing to be good enough,\nbut I really love this industry.\nSo luckily for him\nhe figured that out.\nAnd you talked\nabout the superpower\nof being like loving your job.\nThe one thing I claim to be\na superpower is the ability\nto take a step back and\ndetach, which I guess\nis going back to your\nmeditation thing.\nBut being able to take a step\nback and look at your life\nand say, man, I've\nbeen skateboarding\nlonger than that guy,\nand he's better than me.\nAnd I've been skateboarding\nlonger than that other guy,\nand he's better than me.\nI'm probably not going to\nbe-- this probably is not\nthe right job for me.\nWhat could I do where I\ncould use my skill set?\nAnd obviously, he had some\nentrepreneurial spirit\nand was able to figure that out.\nSo being able to be\na part of a team.\nAnd it goes to what I was\nsaying earlier about the mob.\nBeing able to be part of\na team, part of the mob,\npart of the gang but\nstill have the ability\nto take a step back,\ndetach from that,\nand assess what is the best way\nfor this team to move forward.\nI mean, you could have\nthis brilliant idea\nthat from now on you're going\nto make all of your podcasts\nabout the molecular\nstructure of whatever.\nAnd the rest of\nthe team probably\nneed to pull you\naside and say, hey,\nman, I know you really care\nabout that, and that's awesome,\nbut everyone really wants to\nhear about this other stuff.\nSo let's tie it in together.\nLet's expand what the specific\nthing you want to talk about.\nSo being able to take\na step back, detach,\nand see the bigger picture to me\nis the true superpower of life.\nAnd it's a lot harder\nthan it sounds.\nAnd this goes back\nto when you start\ntalking about people that\nare going through struggles\nin life.\nAnd I've described this before\nas if I'm looking at you,\nand you're in a bad state.\nYou're depressed.\nYou're sad.\nYou're moping around.\nYou're not getting\nanything done.\nAnd I'm looking at\nyou from the outside,\nand I'm thinking for me,\nI see this storm cloud\naround your head.\nI see the storm cloud\naround your head.\nAnd you're in there, and\nall you see no matter what\ndirection you look is storm.\nAll you see is darkness.\nI'm outside and I'm looking,\noh, hey, man, this guy's\ngot a great education.\nHe's healthy.\nHe's got a good team around him.\nHe's got all these\nthings going for him.\nBut you in that state, you\nliterally cannot see anything\nbut the darkness of the storm.\nAnd that's what's so scary\nabout when people enter\nthat mode is you can look--\nI can look at it from\nthe outside and be like,\nAndrew, you've just got to\nmove like four feet forward,\nand you're going to\nbe through this thing.\nAnd yet you might hear me say\nthat, and you go, no, Jock.\nI'm looking ahead, there's\nnothing but darkness.\nSo helping people move\nforward, take action, and be\nable to get that\nperspective, detach,\nand get outside themselves,\nget outside their own heads.\nTim Ferriss said get\nout of your head.\nGet into your body.\nThat's one way to do it.\nTake action.\nGo do things.\nBut it's very scary.\nAnd I'm sure you've had\nthis experience where you're\ntalking to someone that\nyou know, and they're\nbogged down in\nwhatever problem it is,\nwhatever stress they're under.\nAnd you're looking\nat them going, hey,\nman, it's going to be OK.\nYou can clearly\nsee that whatever\nis bothering them and dragging\nthem, now, you can clearly see.\nA lot of times it's\na relationship.\nThe girl or the guy\nthey got dumped,\nand you go, hey, man, that\nperson was a disaster anyways.\nYou're better off without them.\nAnd they cannot compute that.\nThey are stuck there.\nOr maybe it's the school\nthat they didn't get into,\nor the job that they didn't get.\nAnd they get so\nwrapped up in that.\nThey can't get\nout of that storm.\nAnd it's such a helpless feeling\nto sit there and tell someone,\nhey you just move a\nlittle bit towards me,\nand you're going to\nget out of this storm.\nAnd it's so much\neasier said than done.\nAnd that's why trying\nto engage with people\nand trying to give people that\nsuper power of detachment where\nthey can take a\nstep back and say,\nyou know what,\nyou're right, man.\nThat girl she wasn't who\nI really thought she was.\nI should move on.\nYes.\nBut easier said than done.\nAnd that's one of the\nbiggest challenges\nI think that we have\nas friends and parents\nand teammates is helping\npeople learn to detach,\nlearn to see the bigger picture,\nlearn to see that the problem\nthat you have that your\nwhole world is actually\nnot that big of a deal.\nI've written a bunch\nof kids' books.\nAnd one of the things that\ntriggered me to write kids\nbooks is realizing that-- one\nday my daughter came home--\nit's my oldest daughter-- and\nshe came home from school,\nand she says, I'm stupid.\nWhat do you mean you're stupid?\nI'm stupid.\nI'm dumb.\nWhy do you think that?\nYou know whatever grade\nit is when you're supposed\nto know your timetables?\nI don't know my timetables.\nI said, oh, well, how\nmuch have you studied?\nShe gave me the confused look.\nWhat do you mean studied?\nI said, have you studied\nyet have you made flashcards\nto learn them?\nAnd she didn't.\nShe hadn't.\nShe thought she\nshould just know them.\nFrom the teacher went\nover what they are,\nnow she should know them like\nsome other kids in the class\ndid.\nAnd so I'm sitting there\ngoing, oh, yeah, cool.\nWe'll make some flashcards.\nAnd she made flashcards.\nShe learned her timetables in\n45 minutes, and we were good.\nBut what struck me was to me,\nI was like, oh, no big deal.\nTo her, it was her whole life.\nAnd then I got to see\nthat with my other kids.\nSomebody said something to\nthem in the recess yard.\nAnd I'm like, oh,\nscrew that kid.\nThey don't know what--\ndon't worry about them.\nBut when you're-- that's\ntheir whole world and that\nunfortunately doesn't\nonly apply to kids.\nIt applies to adults as well.\nAnd they get this\nproblem in their world\nthat seems so insurmountable\nand so massive\nbecause that little ecosystem\nthat they're stuck in\nis their world.\nAnd they run into\nthis problem, and it's\ndisruptive in that\nworld, and they don't\nknow how to get out of it.\nI did a podcast talking\nabout these ecosystems\nthat people get into.\nAnd there's all\nthese ecosystems.\nYou're in an ecosystem.\nWe're both in a shared\necosystem of podcasting\nand we could be\nlike, oh, my gosh,\nLex just came out\nwith a new podcast,\nand it's been the\nbiggest success.\nAnd what can I do to\ncatch up with Lex?\nAnd all of a sudden, I\ncould get really bothered,\nyou could get really bothered,\nwe could be bothered by that.\nAnd think, man, I'm a failure.\nMeanwhile, there's people\nthat don't listen to podcasts.\nThere's people that don't\neven know what a podcast is.\nAnd yet it's our whole\nworld if we let it be.\nYou're in the academic world.\nHey, you go-- you're a\nprofessor at Stanford, which\nis a big deal in that world.\nI know people that\ndon't give a rat's ass.\nThey don't know\nwhere Stanford is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nget that all the time.\nJOCKO WILLINK: They don't\nknow where Stanford is.\nIt's no big deal.\nIn the SEAL Teams, same thing.\nSomebody has a problem\nin the SEAL Teams,\nand they think this is the\nwhole world, and I blew it.\nAnd now what are\nthey going to do?\nWhen you're facing a\nsignificant problem\nin life, a relationship,\na problem with a job,\nyou got to remember that\nyou're in one ecosystem,\nand if you step outside of that\necosystem, no one really cares.\nAnd you could go move into\na whole totally different\necosystem and find\nhappiness there.\nBut at least utilize that\nto get out of that storm\ncloud that you're\nin, and you're going\nto find that there's plenty of\nlight out there in the world.\nMove towards that and it's going\nto be a much better situation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, in the spirit\nof authenticity, everything\nyou're saying hits\ndirectly home for me.\nI don't know what people's\nperceptions of me are.\nI actually try not to spend too\nmuch time thinking about that\nand just really try and stay\nin touch with the source.\nAnd I really do believe in this\nnotion that our love of things\nis what can generate energy.\nAnd I try and use action\nto generate energy\nbut also I happen to\nalso love exercise.\nSo that's an easy\none there for me.\nBut I try and stay in that mode.\nBut to be quite honest, I've\nspent much of my adult life\nand probably too much of\nmy teenage life and 20s--\nyou're not quite an\nadult in your 20s,\nat least I certainly wasn't--\nin challenging relationships\nthat admittedly\nwere challenging because of my\nrole in them also, of course.\nAnd each and every\ntime, I remember\nthinking, moving on from this is\nlike this insurmountable thing.\nIn part because I am a\ncaretaker, and I cared.\nAnd it wasn't just about\nme and a selfishness,\nit was about wanting\nto right all the wrongs\nof that person's past.\nI found myself trying to be\na time machine for people.\nI found myself trying to\nfix their family lives.\nI found myself doing\nall of that and also\nignoring all the things\nI need to focus on\nin terms of bettering myself\nand making sure I was showing\nup correct and on and on.\nAnd there are data in the world\nin the form of these people\nthat know me very, very\nwell that I think would\nsay that and a whole lot more.\nThe point isn't those\nspecific relationships\nbut each and every time someone\nwould come along and say,\nlisten, if this isn't good for\nyou, it's not good for them,\nor this is a bad\nsituation, or this isn't\nserving either of you well.\nBut I was myopic, this big.\nAnd not even soda\nstraw view of the world\nlike sand speck of the\nworld and trying to solve\nbecause that's my nature.\nI'm going to solve this.\nI'm going to solve it.\nI'm going to solve it.\nAnd sometimes things were\nsolved for some period of time\nand sometimes they weren't.\nAnd I think one thing that just\nas a confessional, I will say,\nI could really learn\nthe art of detachment.\nI could really learn\nto focus on that more,\nif that's the proper\nlanguage for it.\nI think I'm pretty\ngood at adapting.\nI think I'm pretty good\nat finding good people.\nI'm certainly love\nmy team, and that all\nfeels like natural\nsynergy although it's\nhard work in lab\nand in the podcast.\nBut I think the tendency that\nI have as a problem solver\nis to assume that every\nproblem can be solved,\nand therefore, staying on this\nproblem until it is solved\nis the answer.\nAnd maybe the art of detachment\nand getting some perspective\nwould help because\nif I look back,\nI certainly don't regret the\nexperiences that I've had.\nBut I wasted far too much time.\nAnd frankly, I probably\nwasted far too much\nof other people's time\ntrying to solve problems\nthat could not be solved.\nAnd I think without going\ninto this in any more detail,\nand of course, you can send me\na bill at the end by the way.\nI think--\nJOCKO WILLINK: Confessions\nsessions are free, man\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --yeah.\nSo I think that being a\nproblem solver is great,\nbeing forward center\nmass is great.\nI think learning the systems\nof the brain and body\nand understanding psychology\nand learning about oneself.\nThe Oracle had it right,\nknow thyself in ways\nthat you can\nmaneuver functionally\nin your life and career and\nrelationship, et cetera.\nGreat.\nBut I think there's\nalso a downside\nto being overly fixated.\nIt's like my bulldog,\nCostello, used\nto be like chewing on\nsomething, chewing on something.\nNext thing I know he's\nchewing on his foot.\nAnd you're like, hey.\nAnd you'd have to rip\nhim off his own foot.\nHe'd be like--\n[PANTING] --because that\nchew reflex was just so\nstrong that sometimes it\nwould turn on himself.\nThat's how it feels.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I wrote a\nbook called Leadership Strategy\nand Tactics.\nAnd one of the things that\nI wrote about in that book\nis understanding what's\nimportant and what's not.\nAnd this is very similar to\nwhat you're talking about.\nLooking at a problem\nand taking a step back.\nAnd going, well, A, is\nthis important or not?\nAnd B, is this\nsolvable or is it not?\nAnd C, what's the ROI\non getting it solved?\nAnd what's the effort\nit's going to take\nto get this problem solved?\nAnd how much is it really going\nto impact my world and my life\nif I focus on it?\nSo knowing and\nunderstanding when\nsomething is important or\nnot is a very good skill.\nAnd again, it's a skill that's\ndirectly related to detachment.\nBecause when you're\nin that relationship--\nthis is another thing I've\nbeen telling people lately--\nthe solution to\nyour problem is not\ngoing to be found\nin the problem.\nIt's not going to\nbe found in there.\nYou have to get\nout of the problem\nso that you can look at\nit, make an assessment.\nAnd you can assess how\nto solve the problem\nor whether you need to\nsolve the problem or not.\nI mean, there's a lot\nof things in my life\nright now where I shrug\nmy shoulders and go, OK.\nBut-- It's OK.\nOh, someone's saying this, OK.\nRoger that.\nCarry on.\nNo factor.\nMove on.\nAnd then occasionally,\nyou go, OK, this\nis something I need\nto contend with.\nThis is something I\nneed to deal with this.\nThis is something I need\nto shape or adjust or move\nor solve, to use your word.\nThe reason I laugh when I\nsay that is because problems\nyou have to get in there.\nBut if you take a step\nback, you can usually\nsay, oh, a little\nadjustment here,\na little adjustment\nthere, and that thing\nis going to sort itself out.\nSo detachment is a superpower.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Certainly\nis and it certainly one\nthat I need to focus on more.\nI'm grateful for you\nbringing that up.\nThis is the biologist\nin me, but what\nis your process for engaging\ndetachment or for disengaging?\nIs it an active\nprocess, where you go,\nI'm going to detach from this.\nI'm going to put myself\nin a situation that\nis pulling on me.\nThere's this\ngravitational force,\nand I'm going to create some\nimagery in my mind of walking\naway from it.\nDo I physically\nwalk away from it?\nDo I outsource it\nto somebody else?\nWhat are some tools\nfor detachment?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, this is\none of those situations where\nyou and I had a discussion\nabout the science\nand the practical\napplication aligned.\nSo my original experience\nwith detachment\nwas-- and this is one\nof those moments where\nI said a lot of times things are\njust small moments over time,\nand you make a\nlittle adjustment.\nThis is one of those\nmoments in my life.\nAnd I wrote about in\nLeadership Strategy and Tactics\nwhere I recognized like in\na moment what detachment was\nand how helpful it was.\nI'm on an oil rig doing\na training mission.\nMy whole platoon is\nin a skirmish line\nlooking at a large\narea of the oil rig\nthat we're supposed\nto be clearing.\nAgain, this is not combat.\nThis is in the 90s.\nThere's nothing going on.\nWe're just doing training.\nAnd I'm standing in\nthe skirmish line.\nAnd by the way, I'm the\nyoungest and most junior guy\nin my platoon.\nAnd I'm standing there looking\ndown the sight of my weapon,\nand I'm waiting for\nsomeone to make a call\nand tell us what to do.\nAnd I wait for 5 seconds,\nand I wait for 10 seconds,\nand I wait for 20 seconds,\nand no one's saying anything.\nAnd we're waiting for\na leader in my platoon\nto make a call to tell us what\nto do, to tell me what to do.\nAnd finally after 30 seconds\nwhich seems like an eternity,\nI can't take it anymore.\nAnd so I take a step like a\nfoot, a 1-foot step, 12 inches.\nI take a step off\nthe skirmish line.\nI look to my left.\nI look to my right.\nAnd what I see is every\nother guy in my platoon\nis staring down their\nweapon, staring down\nthe sight of the weapon, which\nmeans their field of view\nis tiny.\nIt's like a 20-degree\nfield of view.\nYou're looking down the\nscope of your weapon,\nor the sight of your\nweapon, and that's\nhow big their field of view is.\nAnd I'm looking,\nand I'm thinking,\noh, there's my\nplatoon commander.\nHe's looking down the scope--\nthe sight of his weapon.\nThere's my platoon\nchief, he's looking down\nthe sight of his weapon.\nThere's my leading\npetty officer,\nhe's looking down the\nsight of his weapon.\nThere's my assistant\nplatoon commander,\nhe's looking down-- so\neveryone in the platoon\nis looking down sight side\nof their weapon, which\nmeans they all have a very\nnarrow field of vision.\nWell, when I take a step\nback and look to my left\nand look to my right, guess what\nkind of field of vision I got?\nI got a massive one.\nI can see the whole scene,\nand I can see exactly what\nit is we need to do.\nAnd at that moment--\nlook, as a new guy, you need\nto keep your mouth shut.\nYou don't say anything.\nAnd I'm thinking, well, but no\none else is saying anything.\nSo I muster up all the courage\nI can, and I open my mouth\nand I say, hold left,\nclear right, which\nis a basic tactical call.\nNo, this is not a\npatent-level genius maneuver.\nIt's just a normal call to make\nin a situation that we were in.\nI say, hold left, clear right.\nAnd I'm expecting\nto get slapped,\ntold, shut up, new guy.\nBut instead,\neveryone just repeats\nthe call, hold left, clear\nright, hold left, clear right.\nAnd we execute the\nmaneuver, and we finish\nthe clearance of this oil rig.\nAnd we get done,\nwe get to the top\nof the oil rig, which means\nwe cleared the whole thing.\nWe're on the helo deck at the\ntop, and we go into a debrief.\nAnd now I'm expecting,\nOK, now, I'm\ngoing to get told, hey,\nwhat were you doing?\nYou need to keep\nyour mouth shut.\nAnd instead, the\nplatoon chief goes,\nhey, Jocko, good call on\nthe cellar deck down there.\nAnd I was like,\nyeah, that's right.\nBut then I thought to\nmyself, hold on a second.\nWhy if I'm the youngest most\njunior guy in this platoon,\nwhy was I able to\nsee what we needed\nto do and make that call?\nWhy did that just happen?\nAnd then I realized it was\nbecause I took a step back.\nTo use your term, I\nbroadened my field\nof view, which\nallowed me to think\nmore clearly because instead of\nbeing hyperfocused and narrowly\nfocused, I broadened\nmy range of vision.\nI took a breath\nbefore I made my call.\nI had take a nice\nbreath to speak clearly.\nAnd I realized that taking\na step back and detaching,\nI got to see infinitely\nmore than even the most\nexperienced guys in my platoon.\nAnd I started doing\nit all the time.\nAnd I started doing\nit in land warfare.\nI started doing it\nin urban combat.\nI started doing it in all these\ntactical training scenarios.\nThese are just training.\nThis is the '90s.\nI started doing these\ntraining scenarios,\nand it always allowed me to\nsee what we needed to do.\nAnd then I started doing it\nwhen I was having conversations\nwith people.\nAnd having a conversation\nwith my platoon chief,\nand I can see that\nhe's starting to turn\na little red in the face.\nAnd we're about to\nargue about something.\nI said, oh, wait a second.\nI'm taking a step back look and\ngo, he's getting mad right now,\nand he's the platoon chief.\nYou better just de-escalate\nthis thing real quick.\nAnd I'd say, hey, you know\nwhat, chief, that sounds good.\nLet me go relook at\nthe plan or whatever.\nAnd so I started to do\nthis with my normal life.\nIt was to not get wrapped\nup in my own emotions.\nNot get wrapped up in the gun\nfight that was happening right\nin front of my face.\nNot to get wrapped up in the\ndetails of what was going on,\nbut instead, take a step\nback, detach, look around\nand then you can make a\nmuch, much better decision.\nAnd it's not-- it's exponential.\nIf you're looking down\nthe sights of your weapon,\nand you take a step back,\nand you look around,\nit's exponential how\nmuch more you can see.\nNow, listen, if you are the\nonly person in a gunfight,\nit's going to be harder for\nyou to do that because you've\ngot to be focused on\nwhatever you're shooting at.\nBut when you have 16 guys\nor 20 guys they're all\nlooking in the same\ndirection, it's very easy\nto be the guy that goes,\nI'm going take a step back,\nlook around, make a call.\nSo when you talk\nabout the mechanics--\nwhen I teach this\nto people now--\nthe mechanics of it, take\na step back literally.\nYou and I are at\na meeting, there's\na bunch of people this starts\nto get heated argument,\nI will literally push my chair\nback away from the table.\nChange my perspective.\nWiden my field of view.\nThe other thing in the SEAL\nTeams you don't want to sound\npanicked on the radio\nfor a couple of reasons.\nNumber one, because when\nyou panic on the radio,\nit's going to cause\nother people to panic.\nNumber two, if you panic\non the radio, and you sound\npanicked, everyone's\ngoing to make fun of you.\nSo when you get back\nfrom the mission\neveryone is going to go--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Double whammy.\nJOCKO WILLINK: --yeah.\nYou sounded like\na baby out there.\nSo what would I do before\nI would key up my radio,\ntake a breath.\nAnd so here I'm manually\nslowing down my breath.\nI'm broadening my field of view.\nSo if you're in a\nmeeting, or you're in a--\nyou're at the\nsupermarket parking lot,\nand someone starts\nto yell at you,\ntake a step back, take a breath,\nbroaden your field of view.\nDetach from those\nemotions that you're\nhaving and make some space.\nAnd that's how I go through\nthe mechanics of detachment.\nNow, I can tell you\nright now I mean,\nwhen you do this all the time,\nwhich I do this all the time.\nYeah, I don't really\nhave to step back.\nBut when you're starting to\nbe able to try and do this,\nabsolutely.\nMake-- And I'll tell\nyou here's another\nlike weird little nuance\nthing, lift your chin up,\nand put your hands down.\nNow, this is not in a combat\nsituation, not in a fight.\nBut here's the thing,\nwhen I get defensive\nwhat am I going to do?\nI'll raise my hands up\nand put my chin down.\nThat's like a fighting mode.\nSo if you and I are\nhaving a discussion,\nand I'm starting to get heated,\nand I'm starting to like,\noh, he's not listening to me.\nInstead of me putting my chin\ndown and put my hands like\nup to where I can put them\nin your face a little bit,\nno, I'm actually going\nto take a step back\nand say, put my chin up.\nIt changes my perspective\na little bit more,\nchanges my visual\nperspective just by changing\nthe angle of my head.\nTake a step back,\nput my hands down.\nI'm not being in a defensible--\nI actually want to hear\nwhat you have to say.\nAnd if I start listening\nto what you have to say\nand not talking--\nit's very hard to be\ndetached when you're talking.\nIt's another key component.\nYou want to detach,\nshut your mouth.\nSo I'm in meetings in a\nbunch of different companies.\nI'm running-- I\nhave a bunch of--\nI own a bunch of\ndifferent companies.\nI'm in a meeting\nin my companies,\nI'm not the one that's\ndoing all the talking.\nIn fact, I'm doing\nmostly listening.\nWhen I'm in Task Unit\nBruiser, my task unit,\nI'm not sitting there\ngiving the entire brief.\nNo, I'm letting\nthe platoon chief\nand the platoon commanders\ngive those briefs.\nAnd that way, I'm detached.\nI'm listening to what\nthey have to say.\nI'm more capable of seeing what\nholes there are in their plans\nby not moving my mouth,\nnot talking, I'm listening.\nSo those are some of the\nmethodologies that I use\nand that I advise people to use\nin order to effectively start\ndown the pathway of being able\nto detach in various scenarios.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nAgain, I'm saying I love\nit because I do love it.\nAnd thank you.\nI think it's a\nwonderful technique.\nWe've talked before\non your podcast\nand some of my listeners,\nmaybe not all to this podcast\nwill be familiar with the\nfact that when we narrowly\nfocus our gaze on one target,\na number of things happen.\nOur visual world becomes\nconstricted, of course,\nbut also that we start\nslicing time more finely.\nAnd the dopamine\nsystem tends to start\ndoing anticipation and trying\nto guide and direct things\nin that narrow tunnel of view,\nwhereas when we literally\ntake on panoramic vision,\nso not necessarily moving\nour head around,\nalthough, one could,\nbroadening our field of view\nor looking at a horizon,\nespecially if we're walking.\nBut getting that kind of--\nnot kind of getting a\nbroader field of view,\nwe slice time differently.\nThings don't feel\nas imposing on us.\nThis is the physiological\nsubstrate underlying\nwhat you're describing.\nAnd I think it\ngoes a step further\nbecause in that\nopen, larger aperture\nof visual understanding,\nthere's an open larger window\nof cognitive understanding, and\nnew options start to surface.\nI mean, I think this is--\nI have long been\nfascinated by the fact\nthat this actually became--\nI'll tell this real quick story.\nIn 2015, I went over to Spain\nto do some mountaineering\nwith Wim Hof.\nAnd this wasn't because\nI wanted a podcast.\nI didn't have any social media.\nI just went over\nthere because I'd\nheard this guy, Wim, contacted\nhim, and somehow arranged\na trip for myself.\nAnd I went over there, and\nwe did some crazy dangerous\nmountaineering that I\nhad no business doing.\nAlmost ripped my left\nleg off in a stunt\nthat was organized\nby others there\nthat I never should have done.\nIn any case, one\nday I look and Wim\nis like crouched\non the ground next\nto like a curb in this\nparking lot before our hike.\nAnd he's down there on the\nground with a little stick.\nAnd I was like,\nwhat are you doing?\nHe's like, look.\nAnd there were ants\nclimbing up this thing.\nAnd he's like, there\nmountaineering this curb.\nAnd I thought, this\nguy's different.\nBut then I realized we were\nabout to do the same thing\nup this big face.\nAnd I thought, wow, he's able to\nthink at these different scales\nand see similarities.\nThat's pretty cool.\nI would have never\nstopped to look there,\nand I still remember it.\nAnd was it profound?\nNo.\nBut was it interesting?\nyeah, in the sense\nthat things are happening\nat all scales all the time.\nAnd we think we know the\nscale to pay attention to,\nand we think that that's\nthe one that matters most.\nAnd I think it's fair to\nsay that in a gunfight,\nthere is a scale\nthat matters most\nbut new options, new\nperspectives actually come\nfrom that broader\nfield of view, which\nis what you're describing.\nAnd later that day-- it's\ninteresting because this group\ngoing up, some of them were\nreally challenged in the climb.\nAnd Wim went back\nto this example\nof how the ants would stack\non top of one another.\nAnd he used an analogy\nfrom that to help people\nthrough this climb.\nAnd there was a beautiful\npool at the top,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAnyway, I think\nthat these examples\nare in fact meaningful,\nespecially the ones\nthat you gave because they\ndon't just relate to military.\nI mean, you can imagine\naround the dinner table.\nI've had this.\nKids are there and\npartners there.\nAnd sometimes it's really\nnice to sit back and just\nhear it all and bask in it all.\nBut oftentimes, new\ninformation will surface.\nLike you said, all I'm hearing\nis worries out of this person.\nOr they're not even really here.\nThey're all talking\nabout what we're\ngoing to do next time,\nnext time, next time.\nAnd you can reanchor people\nlike, hey, look, maybe\nlet's focus on what\nwe're doing here.\nOr sometimes people\nare hyperfocused\non what's happening\nthere, and they\nneed to think about\nsomething in the future.\nI love this.\nI need to practice detachment\nin a number of different domains\nin my life.\nOne thing that I am realizing\nafter hearing you describe\nthe process that I\nreally need to do\nis I need to start taking\nsome time away from my work.\nMaybe even a little bit of\ntime parallel to relationship\nto get better perspective on it.\nBecause I think the problem\nsolving nature in us\nreally makes us myopic,\nreally makes us nearsighted.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah that's--\nyou see this a lot.\nI mean, I get to see this a lot.\nWe do events with\ncompanies, businesses.\nAnd we go offsite somewhere\nwhere they're detached.\nThey're just they're\ndefacto detached\nfrom their day-to-day business.\nYou pull someone out of\ntheir business for two days\nand all of a sudden, they\nstart seeing the solutions.\nThey never see them like it's a\nlot harder for them to see them\nwhen they're in the firefight.\nYou get them out of the\nfirefight, it's hard for them\nto see it when they're in that\nacquisition that they're doing.\nHow are we going to\nmerge these two cultures?\nThis is going to be impossible.\nBoom, pull them out.\nAll right, let's talk\nabout the two cultures.\nAnd let's talk about what\npossible outcomes are.\nAnd all of a sudden, when you\nget them to take a step back,\nthe solutions will appear.\nAnd it is true in a gunfight.\nNow, listen, if it's a\none-on-one gunfight, even then\nthe ability to take a step\nback and look around or use\nyour peripheral vision, you\nhave to be able to do this.\nIt's going to increase.\nIt's exponential\nhow much it-- that's\nwhy it's like a superpower.\nIt's like cheating.\nIt's like cheating.\nI was speaking of Seth Stone.\nSeth Stone took over--\nhe became a task unit\ncommander, troop commander\nwhen we got back from Ramadi.\nAnd so now he's\nthe guy in charge,\nand now I was\nrunning the training.\nAnd a couple of months into his\ntraining, he broke his neck.\nBroke his vertebrae in his neck.\nHis spinal cord was OK, so he\nwas the guy with the big neck\nbrace on, and he couldn't\ndo any arduous training.\nAnd his SEAL task unit,\nwhich is two platoons,\nwas going through their\nland warfare training.\nAnd he couldn't do it.\nHe couldn't carry a rucksack,\ncouldn't carry a machine gun,\nso he couldn't do it.\nSo I said, hey, I'm coming out.\nLet's go out, and you\ncan observe your guys,\nand see how they're doing.\nAnd so there we are.\nWe're out in the desert.\nHis troop is going through\nfield training exercise,\nour full mission profile.\nSo it's like a big\nfake operation,\nthere's a fake target,\nthere's fake bad guys.\nWe're using these high\nspeed laser guns to shoot.\nAnd we're standing\non this little berm.\nAnd at a certain point\nin the operation,\nhis whole task\nunit, like 40 guys,\ngets pinned down in\nthis little ravine.\nAnd so we're standing in\nthe ravine with these guys,\nand no one's making\nany decisions.\nAnd the enemy with these laser\nguns are starting to maneuver\nand starting to--\nthey're killing guys\nbecause these laser\nguns you can die.\nAnd Seth he hits me on the arm.\nHe said, can I tell\nhim what to do?\nAnd I was like, no.\nLet them figure it out.\nSo another 30 seconds\npass, another guy\ngets killed with laser.\nHe hits me again, bro, let\nme say something to them.\nAnd I was like, no,\nlet them figure it out.\nAnother minute goes by,\ntwo more guys are now dead.\nJust laser dead\nbut they're dead.\nAnd he hits me again, and he's\nlike, bro, let me tell them.\nAnd I go, all right,\ngo ahead and tell them.\nAnd so he just crouches down\nnext to one of the guys,\nand bangs him on the\nshoulder, goes, peel right.\nAnd which is again, it's just\na fundamental basic call.\nAnd the guy shouts\nit out, peel right.\nAnd they start\npeeling peeling right.\nAnd another minute later,\nthey're all out of the kill\nzone and everything's OK.\nAnd then Seth looks at\nme, and he goes, man, this\nis so easy way up here.\nAnd I said, bro,\nlook at where we are.\nWe are in the ravine\nwith the guys.\nNow, we're on a knee and\nthe guys are laying down,\nbut it's not this--\nwe weren't on some\nelevated position.\nAnd I said, hey, it's not that\nwe're in an elevated position.\nIt's just that we're\ndetached and looking around.\nAnd he goes, oh, my God.\nAnd I said, hey, you\nremember when you and I went\nthrough this training?\nAnd he goes, yeah.\nAnd I go, this is what it\nwas like for me all the time.\nI was constantly\njust looking around,\nso that's why it seems\nlike a magic power, right?\nIt's like a superpower because\nSeth's down there with his gun,\nand he's shooting.\nAnd I'm like, hey, bro, move\nyour guys over to that--\ngo to that ridgeline right\nthere, set security, boom.\nAnd how did Jocko see that?\nJocko must be a tactical genius.\nNo, I'm not a tactical genius.\nI'm just taking a step\nback and looking around.\nAnd like you just said,\nit applies to everything\nthat we do.\nIf you're having a conversation\nwith your significant other,\nand you start to see that\nthey're getting frustrated\nabout something,\nnow, look, if you're\nin the conversation 100%, you're\ngoing to get frustrated too.\nYou're going to get\nfrustrated, they're frustrated.\nNext thing you know you've got\nan emotional argument going on,\nwhereas if you take a mental\nstep back and say, wait,\nwhy are they\nfrustrated right now?\nOh, because I'm trying to solve\ntheir problem when really what\nthey're looking to do is vent.\nOK, got it.\nLet them vent.\nOK, cool.\nOh, that sounds horrible.\nWhat do you think\nyou're going to do?\nInstead of saying, well,\nif that's the problem,\nhere's what you should do\nbecause people aren't always\nlooking for that.\nSo yeah, this\nthing, this ability\nis-- and it's something that\ncan absolutely be trained,\nand that's what's cool about it.\nIt can absolutely be trained.\nIt's not a natural gift.\nIt's some people we're be\nbetter at it than others,\nbut it's something\nthat you can train.\nAnd I used to see\nguys develop it.\nAnd I see people develop it\nnow in the business world where\nthey'll report back to me, we\nhad a meeting with the union\ntoday, and the union\nstarted escalating\nwhat they wanted to do.\nAnd I just took--\nI detached, and we\nended up de-escalating,\nand now we got a solution.\nSo this is an absolute skill\nset that can be learned,\nand that's what makes\nit especially nice.\nBecause there's\nsome people-- look,\nif you're very articulate,\nborn very-- some people\nare born more articulate\nthan other people.\nSome people are\nborn with an ability\nto simplify things\nmore than others.\nAnd you can train.\nYou can become more articulate.\nYou can become-- you can\nlearn to simplify things more.\nAnd some people are going to\nbe naturally good at detaching,\nbut everyone can\nget better at it,\nand that's a beautiful thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\na beautiful thing,\nand I'm highly\nincentivized to do this.\nI mean, there are\nareas of my life\nthat are going really well that\nI also want to apply it there.\nI think that I've tended to\nrely on people close to me\nas a way to access\nthis detachment.\nI will be very direct\nin saying that I am not\nthe leader of my podcast.\nThere is a leader, it is not me.\nI'm part of the team,\nbut it is not me.\nAnd I often rely on his input.\nAnd sometimes that\ninput is solicited\nand sometimes it's not.\nOne place for instance where\nyou see people getting really\nmyopic is on social media.\nAnd I've experienced this.\nI'd love to say that\nI'm always nonreactive.\nAnd I think in general I take\nthe stance that I have filters.\nSo I have filters.\nI know why I'm there.\nI'm interested in being\na teacher and a giver\nand informing people about the\nbeauty and utility of biology.\nThat's why I say, it's not a\nmission statement, it's a fact.\nThat's what I care about.\nAnything that doesn't\nfit through that filter,\nI don't really have\nany business doing.\nBut occasionally, I like to\nmake a joke or something.\nBut occasionally\nsomething comes through.\nAnd I find myself\nsaying, wait a second.\nAnd you get sucked\ninto that tunnel.\nAnd sometimes it's observing\nother people in tunnels.\nAnd when you're\nnot in the tunnel,\nit's so obvious\nwhat's happening.\nYou're watching, in some\ncases, people just dragging\ntheir lives, and some cases,\nsinking their entire careers.\nI mean, the former\nchair of Psychiatry\nat Columbia\nUniversity in New York\nmade an absolutely foolish,\ntruly insensitive, totally\ninappropriate tweet.\nThat's my opinion.\nAnd I think it was the\nopinion of all the people\nthat fired him from his job.\nThis person was at the\napex of his career.\nLost his job for saying\nsomething terrible.\nAnd in retrospect,\nwas said something\nlike, I don't know\nwhat I was thinking.\nAnd so this guy\nis a psychiatrist,\nso he lives in the\nstudy and the treatment\nof the mind, which just goes\nto show that everyone I think\nis susceptible to being\npulled into these tunnels.\nAnd fortunately, everyone\nis susceptible to learning\nto teach themselves how to\nlatch themselves out of it.\nSo I love this idea\nof a teachable skill.\nI'm certainly going\nto practice it\nin one on one and\nin group situations\nand in a variety of situations.\nI think that the tunnel\nhas a gravitational pull.\nThere's like an\nallure to that tunnel.\nAnd I always just go right\nback to the neurochemistry.\nI think that there's\nsomething about solving\na problem inside of a tunnel\nlike an animal on a chase.\nBut at some point, that\nanimal could get picked off,\nrun over by a truck\nbecause it was--\ndidn't have enough\nsituational awareness.\nI'm definitely going to practice\nthis through opening the gaze\nand broadening gaze.\nAnd I think I also I'm due for\na couple of days off from things\nto just walk and\nthink about work.\nOn these retreats, do\npeople work on work\nor are they just there\nto do other things,\nand that's where\nthe ideas surface?\nJOCKO WILLINK: We'll do\na little bit of both.\nSo we'll do some stuff\nthat is focused on work,\nbut then we'll pull\nout and do things\nthat are completely unrelated\nto work for that very reason.\nWhether we do\nsomething physical,\nwhether we do some\nmental exercise,\nbut we do things\nthat are completely\nunrelated to their\nwork and take those\nbreaks in order for\nthem to free their mind.\nAnd you know what bothers\nyou about social media?\nThis is when you say there's\nsome things that make you mad--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean,\nnot me, but it could be.\nOf course, I'm human.\nLittle things\nprevent-- and it's not\nthe things that are obvious.\nIt's actually not\ndirect critique of me.\nIt's when people exploit\nmisunderstandings\nto try and create a greater\nmisunderstanding that\ndoesn't exist.\nThat's what gets me because\nto a scientist, that's\nlike the most irritating thing.\nI don't know what the analogy\nwould be in the SEAL Teams,\nbut it's someone\nhijacking something--\nThey didn't mean that but then\nthey distort the argument.\nThe word gaslighting gets\nthrown around a lot now.\nA lot of people actually\nthink that anytime someone\nstates a boundary.\nNo, I don't believe\nthat's gaslighting.\nTrust me, the psychiatrist, who\nare all professionally trained,\ntell me that is not gaslighting.\nGaslighting is a\nvery particular thing\nwhere you're trying to alter\nsomeone's reality in a very\nactive almost like\nsociopathic way.\nSo I that's a little\neditorializing right there.\nWhat bothers me is\nwhen people hijack--\nsometimes someone\nin an argument isn't\nas sophisticated with their\nlanguage as somebody else.\nSo someone will hijack\nthat lack of sophistication\nand try and flip\nthem on their back.\nThat sort of thing\nreally gets under my skin\nbecause I feel that creates\nan unnecessary divide.\nThere are a few other things.\nBut I always joke in my lab.\nAnd I'll say, I have\n3,000 pet peeves,\nbut I also have\n3,000 flaws to match\neach one of those pet peeves.\nJOCKO WILLINK: So\nyeah, whenever--\nThis is not just social\nmedia, but it's just\nlife when somebody says\nsomething about me or to me\nthat I don't like.\nWhat I realized years\nago is the reason\nI don't like it\nis because there's\nsome truth in what\nthey're saying.\nAnd the best thing to do is\nto say either to yourself\nif you're by\nyourself or to them,\nis to say, yeah, you're right.\nI am a knucklehead sometimes.\nOr yeah, you're right.\nI sometimes do jump\nto conclusions.\nOr yeah, you're right.\nI was completely\nwrong about that.\nAnd that is just so\nmuch more liberating\nand healthy than\nsaying, you don't\nknow what you're talking about.\nOr no, I don't--\njust going into\nthat defensive mode\nand trying to close your mind\ninstead of opening your mind up\nto listen to what somebody\nelse has to say, and say,\nyeah, that's a good point.\nYou're spot on with that one.\nNext question, next\ncomment, let's go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: One thing\nI appreciate about you\non social media is\nthe limited number\nof words in each\nof your responses.\nIt's a great thing forcing you\nto be efficient and concise\nactually is a huge advantage.\nIt also forces you to be\nprecise at least about category.\nI think there's something\nto be said for that.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Well,\nthere's a good example.\nSo I was on Twitter\nthe other day\nsince Twitter is getting a\nlot of traction right now.\nThere's a lot of\nmayhem going on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nthe other gun fight.\nJOCKO WILLINK: And\nsomebody asked me,\nsomebody said, hey, I'm\ngoing to boot camp soon.\nWhat advice do you have for me?\nAnd I wrote back, enjoy.\nBoom.\nAnd like you said, I\nmean, it's Twitter.\nI'm responding to\na bunch of people.\nAnd then somebody else\nchimed in and said,\nyou might as well not\neven answer, Jocko\nthat's not helping\nthis guy at all.\nAnd look at your face.\nFor those of you\nthat are watching,\nyour face just got a\nlittle bit mad, right?\nYou got a little bit\ndefensive for me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, well,\nI think, that's my nature.\nI don't like seeing\nother people attacked.\nI think that's just my nature.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I had\na split second off\nwho the hell is this guy?\nAnd then I said, you\nknow what, he's right.\nAnd then I tweeted again back.\nI said, sorry, man.\nYou're right.\nWhat I should have\nsaid was, hey,\nread the book Leadership\nStrategy and Tactics.\nIt's a good book\nfor someone that\nis going to be in an environment\nthat's going to be challenging\nand where you're going to\nbe faced with leadership\nchallenges.\nAnd enjoy boot camp because\nif your mindset is this sucks\nand this is terrible,\nit's going to be terrible,\nand it's going to suck.\nAnd if you go with a mindset of\nhey, this is a cool experience,\nand I should enjoy\nit, you're going\nto have a much better time.\nThat's my full answer.\nI'm sorry I didn't give you--\nand it's perfectly fine.\nThat guy was right\nto critique me.\nAnd he was right in saying that.\nAnd there was a bunch--\nwhat's funny is a bunch of\nother people came to my defense\nand said, this guy--\nthat's really great.\nBut my point is instead of me\ngetting defensive and crazy\nand letting it drive me crazy,\nopen my mind a little bit,\nlisten to what they have to say,\naccept that there's got to be\nsome level of truth in it.\nAnd there was.\nI gave a guy a very,\nvery terse response,\nand I could have\nexpanded on it more.\nAnd I did.\nNo big deal.\nGood times.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nA few minutes ago, I\nwas thinking to myself,\nI wonder where your mind\nis at in the few moments\nbefore you fall asleep.\nAre you able to make yourself\ngo mind blank pretty easily?\nIt's something I've been\npracticing more because I\ntend to, again ruminate--\nI like to drill into\nproblems, obviously.\nYesterday I did a solo episode,\nwhich when we do those,\nthey are usually anywhere\nfrom five to 20 hours of prep.\nAnd then the recordings, I\nwon't say how long they take.\nBut I love going\ninto the tunnel.\nThe tunnel is that's\nwhere the juice is for me.\nAnd finding the structure.\nAnd I have the benefit\nof an amazing producer\nwho helps me sort through it.\nAnd I came out of this\nthing, and then went home,\ncouldn't eat.\nBecause I was like,\nI don't want dinner.\nAnd then I was\nexplaining a call I had\nwith a colleague the other day.\nMy partner-- my girlfriend\nshe was just like, OK.\nI'm going to sleep.\nAnd I was up and texting and\nthinking and writing notes out.\nAnd I thought, oh,\nman, I'm like Costello\nlike chewing on the stick\nand chewing into my paw.\nI need sleep.\nI need to go to sleep.\nSo I think I have a bit of\na harder time disengaging,\nclearly.\nAnd this is why I never\ntouch cocaine or amphetamine\nbecause I think\nthat some of us have\na love of the dopamine\ncircuitry that--\nI always sensed if I were to\nhave tried drugs like that,\nthey might have been\nthe thing that would hit\nmy neural circuits just right.\nSome people talk about\nalcohol that way.\nI've read books by\nalcoholics like the book\nDry and few other--\nRich Roll talks about\nthis, that he drank alcohol\nfor the first time in college.\nIt was like this\nelixir that filled\nhis body that made him feel\nright for the first time.\nThat is not how I feel\nafter a couple of drinks.\nI feel a little relaxed,\nbut I can do without it.\nBut this drilling into\nsomething is really that's my--\nI guess, maybe that's my--\nI don't think it's a superpower,\nbut I have some strength there.\nBut I think it's also the thing\nthat can cut on the other side.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nwhen you started off\nthis conversation\nearly you talked\nabout getting up in the\nmorning, and you just get up,\nand you have these--\nI was about to go down\nthe path of it's--\nat nighttime when I'm\ntrying to go to sleep\nand I have some random\nthought about some thing, that\ncan be a hard--\nI have a visual thing\nthat's going on.\nIt seems like I'm\non a roller coaster,\nand I'm going in like\na new idea comes,\nand I'm just on\nthis awesome ride,\nand it's not going to stop.\nAnd I can't-- I don't\nknow how to stop that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.\nI mean, I think it goes with\npeople who are very driven\nand like to master\ndifferent crafts.\nI have a colleague, his\nname is Karl Deisseroth.\nHe's a bioengineer.\nHe has five children,\nand he's a psychiatrist.\nHe's like an incredible-- one\nof these people that does a ton.\nVery likely will\nwin the Nobel Prize.\nI mean, he's an amazing\nscientists, amazing guy.\nAnd he does this\npractice that he does,\nwhich is not a\nmeditation, which he\nsits for an hour late at\nnight after his kids have gone\nto sleep, and he\nforces himself, forces\nhimself to think in\ncomplete sentences\nwith punctuation\nabout some problem.\nI tried doing that for about\nfive minutes, and I fell off.\nBut it's something that\nhe's cultivated in himself,\nwhich helps him in his career.\nI don't think-- it's certainly\nnot something I recommend.\nIf I did that at 1:00\nor 2:00 in the morning,\nI think that would\nbe bad for my sleep.\nBecause falling asleep\nactually requires\ndrifting into these\nkind of liminal states.\nIt's one of the reasons why\nI'm a big proponent of things\nlike nonsleep deep rest, or\nthese yoga nidra practices,\nwhich are basically\nbody scans where\nyou're trying to learn to\ndetach from the sensory world.\nAnd they're very effective at--\ncertainly for me\nthey've been very\neffective at teaching\nme to turn off\nthinking, which is\nan interesting notion\nin its own right.\nBut I like the\nidea of detachment\nby stepping back and\ngetting perspective.\nMy father is much\nbetter at that.\nHe's a very calm guy in\nthe world of confrontation.\nI always knew it when I was\na kid because he would blink,\nwhich meant like something\nwas going to happen\nlike I was going to get it.\nAnd now-- but I've always\nknown that he can control\nhis responses, his behavior.\nOthers of us in the family you\nknow beside from New Jersey,\nwe're more like\ngo to loggerheads.\nSo I don't know.\nThis raises a\nquestion, and I think\nit's one that I and several\nother people I talked to\nin anticipation of this\npodcast were asking.\nI think one reason\nwhy people are\ndrawn to people who have\nbeen in the SEAL Teams,\nand you in particular, are that\nI think everybody, not just\nmales but females too.\nI think everybody wants to know\nlike their calibration point\non their level of toughness.\nI think people wonder.\nI think when people\ntalk about BUD/S and all\nthat, I think a lot\nof people wonder,\nwould I make it through?\nI've certainly wondered it.\nI haven't spent hours on it.\nI went my path.\nI'm happy for the path I went.\nBut I think people wonder,\ndo I have this thing\nthat supposedly\nBUD/S selects for?\nAnd if I don't, how tough\nam I or not tough am I?\nI think that we all can look\nat other people physically--\nand I'm not somebody\nthat does a lot of this.\nI know some people are\nreally obsessed by this like,\noh, that person has an eight\npack with veins on their leg.\nI don't understand that.\nThat's not me, but I\nunderstand some people do that\neven to the point of pathology.\nBut I think most people\nwonder, how resilient am I?\nAnd they can look to experiences\nthat they've survived\nand say, oh, I made it through,\nor I'm resilient or not.\nBut is there a way that we can--\ncertainly that we can train\nit by doing hard things?\nCold showers, this kind of thing\nare small examples of those.\nBut do you think it's even\nan important question to ask?\nAnd if it is, how does\none go about thinking,\nhow resilient am I?\nShould we put ourselves into\nsituations of discomfort just\nto test that?\nBecause I will say, I\nthink a lot of people\nlook to SEAL Teams and team guys\nin particular as a calibration\npoint of like, OK, they\nknow how to do hard things.\nThey were selected\nfor the ability\nto carry logs, and get into\ncold water over and over,\nand roll in the sand, and go\nwithout sleep for a week or so.\nBut that's probably not\nwhat they were doing\nwhen they were on deployment.\nIt's clearly a pressure\ntest for something else.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, it's\na strange, strange thing.\nThe Basic Underwater\nDemolition SEAL training.\nAnd quite frankly, going\nand getting wet and cold\nand being miserable is\nactually nothing compared\nto being on deployment.\nAnd a good example that\nI use to compare this to\nis, when I was on deployment\nin 2006 in Ramadi, there was--\nas you were driving off base\nto go into the city and conduct\noperations, as you drove out\nof the compound, on your right\nwas this area that was\ncalled the vehicle graveyard.\nAnd the vehicle graveyard was\nexactly what it sounds like.\nIt was probably\n75 or 100 vehicles\nthat were blown up,\ndestroyed, burned,\nin various twisted conditions\nthat had been dragged back\nthrough the city and put\ninto this vehicle graveyard.\nAnd as you drove by\nthat vehicle graveyard,\nyou know without\nquestion that every one\nof those twisted vehicles\nrepresented one, two, three,\nfour, five, American casualties\nhorribly wounded, killed.\nAnd there you are in a\nvehicle about to roll out\ninto that city where\nwhat you're looking at\ncan easily be you in\nthe next three minutes.\nAnd you're going\nto do that today.\nYou're going to\ndo that tomorrow.\nYou can do that the next day and\nthe day after that and the day\nafter that.\nThat compared to--\nand by the way,\nthis isn't just seals\nthat are doing that.\nThis is Marines, this is the\narmy guys that are over there.\nThis is what everyone is doing.\nAnd they do it.\nThey do it.\nI talk about Marc Lee\nwho was one of my guys.\nFirst CO killed in Iraq.\nAnd he was the lead turret\ngunner in the lead Humvee.\nAnd in Vietnam, if you were\nthe point man in Vietnam,\nif you're in infantry\npatrol, you're\nthe point man in Vietnam,\nyou were at risk--\nbooby traps, ambush.\nSo they rotated you out.\nYou didn't have to stay\nup there all the time.\nYou do an hour up as point man,\nthey get someone else up there.\nAnd that guy, the\nlead turret gunner\nin a Humvee column of four,\nor five, or six vehicles,\nif you hit an IED, that's the\nvehicle that's going to hit it.\nIf you go into an\nambush, that's the guy\nthat's going to get hits.\nThe guy that's standing up in\na 50 caliber turret, that's\nthe guy that's going to die.\nAnd Marc-- he was\na new guy, so he's\nin that lead turret, 50 Cal.\nAnd he never asked\nto get rotated out.\nAnd I remember he was a very--\nI like to say very.\nHe was extremely charismatic,\nfunny, gregarious comedian.\nAnd we got all kinds\nof stories about Marc.\nBut one of them, we were in\nVegas, and we're all gambling.\nAnd I come down\nfrom my hotel room,\nand I see Marc across the--\nhe's playing blackjack.\nWhen he sees me,\nhe goes, hey, sir,\nwhen are the new\nCadillacs coming out.\nLike he's just lighting\nup everybody, just having\na fantastic time.\nBut I remember one night he's\ngetting ready to roll out.\nAnd if I wasn't going\nout with the platoons,\nI would go out see the guys\noff, give them a hands salute\nas they're leaving.\nAnd I'm like, how are\nyou feeling, Marc?\nHow you doing, Marc?\nAre you good to go?\nAnd he's like,\nfeeling lucky, sir.\nThat was his attitude.\nAnd he's a guy that's going\nto drive by that vehicle\ngraveyard, drive right\nout of that city,\nand he's going to do it the next\nday, and the day after that,\nand the day after that.\nSo-- and like I said, that's\nwhat the army guys are doing.\nThat's what the Marine\nCorps guys are doing.\nThey're doing it.\nAnd so as much as the mythology\naround basic SEAL training\ngoes, to me that experience\nin combat and what guys do\nis infinitely harder and\ninfinitely more important.\nNow, all that being\nsaid, basic SEAL training\nis a very strange\nlaboratory for human beings.\nIt is a very strange\nlaboratory for human beings.\nAnd it's crazy the way it works.\nIt's obviously extremely\ndifficult, but there's no--\nI wouldn't put money.\nYou could put odds\non somebody making it\nthrough like, hey,\nthat guy seems\nlike he's going be good to go.\nBut I wouldn't put a\nbunch of money on it.\nAnd I wouldn't take like 100%,\nI would never take 100% bet\non anybody because\nthere's no one that's\n100% going to make it\nthrough that training.\nAnd there's just\nrandom-- some people say,\nwell, it's because your why.\nThere's people that make\nit through SEAL training\nbecause their ex-girlfriend\nsaid they couldn't make it.\nThere's some other\nguy that makes it\nthrough because they promised\nGod that they would make it.\nThere's some other\nguy that made it\nthrough because their dad\nsaid they could never.\nThere's lie every one of these\nexamples you can come up with.\nAnd it's good enough for some\nrandom dude to make it through.\nAnd it doesn't matter\nwhat your pedigree is.\nIt doesn't matter\nwhere you're from.\nThere's guys from Iowa.\nThere's guys from Florida.\nThere's guys from\nwherever that make it.\nAnd those guys from Iowa,\nand those guys from Florida,\nand those guys from\nwherever, that don't make it.\nGuys from farms.\nGuys from silver\nspoon in their mouth,\nand you just can't predict it.\nAnd I mean, it has to have\nsomething to do with the fact\nthat how bad you\nactually want to do it.\nThat's-- it's a strange thing.\nAnd I wouldn't try and--\nif I was in the world, if\nI didn't do that training,\nI wouldn't be trying to\nfigure out if I could make it\nor not because you don't know.\nYou don't know.\nIt's a very strange thing.\nAnd it's so mythical\nalmost right now.\nIt's mythical that\nhow hard it is.\nAnd this is not too many\npeople make it through, man.\nIt's--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 15%.\nJOCKO WILLINK: --yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nfrom all the folks\nthat I've talked to there, or\ngone through, been instructors\nthere, some we\nboth know, it seem\nthat that 15% number is unlikely\nto change as long as they\nkeep the process the same.\nIt just seems\nabout 15% of people\nseem to have something\nin them that can perhaps\ngrow during that training.\nBut that it is being\nidentified and selected for\nrather than somehow\nbeing built up\nacross at least that phase,\nthe early phases of training.\nAnd then at some point they\nbuild on that capacity.\nAnd this gets to this really\nsomewhat controversial issue\nfrankly, are people\nwired differently?\nAnd listen, I started off\nin neural development.\nAnd I'll tell you that there\nare some universal properties\nof neural development\nin all surviving humans.\nLike that you're going\nto breathe without having\nto think about it.\nYour heart is going\nto beat without having\nto think about it.\nBut beyond that, there's a lot\nof variation in natural levels\nof dopamine and serotonin.\nThere's nature plays a\npowerful role and nurture.\nAnd what's\ninteresting, though, is\nwe can't always\npredict from parents\nwhat nature is going to do.\nRecently we had\nsomeone on the podcast.\nI'm excited for you to listen\nto it if perhaps you will\nif I send it to you.\nThere's a guy who talks about\ninheritable acquired traits.\nYou don't expect that\nbecause you work out\nthat your grandkids\nwill be more muscular\nand have better endurance.\nBut there's actually\nsome evidence\nthat that may be the case.\nAnd you go, well,\nhow could that be?\nWe got two kinds of\ncells in your body.\nIt turns out you\nhave what are called\nsomatic cells, which\nare all of them.\nThen you have the\ngerm cells, which\nare your sperm and\nyour wife's eggs.\nWell, why wouldn't the DNA of\nthe sperm cells and the egg\ncells be modifiable\nby experience\nif all the other cells are?\nAnd it turns out there's\nsome evidence that maybe it's\nnot the DNA but the rNRA.\nThink about that.\nThat means that whether-- and\nwe know this that people that\nhave been in a famine,\nseveral generations later,\ntheir implications for\nblood sugar regulation\nin their great grandkids.\nSo the idea that experience\nand acquired traits\ncan change us is actually\nhas some validity.\nAnd this gets into\nreally complicated things\nto people who go, oh, this\nis like the giraffe that\nhad to crane its neck,\nand then gave birth\nto longer necked giraffes.\nAnd it's like, well, not exactly\nbut also not entirely untrue\neither.\nSo I love the idea that\nthere are inherited traits\nand that nature and\nnurture play a role,\nbut that hard work may actually\ntransmit across generations.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,\nthere's in SEAL training\nyou have kids that come through\nthat they call legacies, which\nmeans that they have a dad--\nI think a dad,\nbrother, whatever.\nAnd they do have a better\nchance of making it,\nbut it's not a\nguaranteed chance at all.\nAnd my personal\nopinion is I think\na legacy kid would have a\nbetter chance of making it just\ndue to the Thanksgiving\ndinner that you're\ngoing to have to go through\nfor the rest of your life\nwith your family--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If you don't.\nJOCKO WILLINK: --yeah,\nif you're even invited,\nwhich you might be on your own.\nBut yeah, maybe there's\nsomething to that as well.\nBut I think that's\njust more the pressure\nthat someone must feel\nlike, hey, there's\nno way I'm going to be\nallowed back in my home\nif I don't make it\nthrough this training.\nSo I'm going to have to just\ngo ahead and suck it up.\nBut not everyone makes it.\nAnd it's a bummer\nwhen that does occur.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, for people\nwho are not thinking about going\nthrough SEAL training, or who\nmiss the opportunity, or who\nare not interested in that\nfor whatever\nreason, do you think\nthere's value to\ndoing things each day\nthat suck a little bit?\nOr from time to\ntime doing something\nthat puts one into a state\nof deliberate discomfort?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, 100%.\nYeah, I mean, 100%.\nI mean, even in order\nto improve yourself,\nyou've got to impose some\ndiscipline on yourself.\nIf you want to get\nstronger, you've\ngot to do things that\nrequire strength.\nIf you want to be\ntougher, you've\ngot to do things that\nrequire you to be tougher.\nI think that's pretty\nstraightforward.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Does\nthat mean doing things\nthat are not pleasurable?\nSo for instance, I've\ndone some long podcasts.\nAnd a few weeks ago, we were\ndoing a series with Andy Galpin\nall about exercise\nand exercise science.\nAnd we did six podcasts in that\nweek, the most I've ever done,\nwhich made doing four or five\nthe next week not so bad.\nBut I loved every second of it.\nAnd I love every\nsecond of podcasting.\nAnd so it didn't suck, but it\nbuilt up a greater capacity.\nI guess, I'm asking\nspecifically about things that\nreally feel like a splinter.\nIs there any value to that?\nBecause I have to say there\nare some people I know,\nsome of them are former team--\nare team guys, I guess, you\ndon't say former team guys.\nThey are out of the Teams now,\nbut they're team guys forever,\nwho seem to not be\nrattled by little things.\nThose guys in particular,\nthey don't seem\nto be rattled by little things.\nAnd then I know people that\nthey get the wrong size\ncoffee at a coffee\nshop, and they dissolve\ninto a puddle of tears.\nSo there does seem\nto be something\nto this whole like\nmental resilience thing\nand flexibility thing.\nAnd I try and do something\nthat's uncomfortable to me\nabout once a week, something\nI really don't like.\nIt doesn't matter what\nthat is, but I try and do\nsomething that's unpleasant.\nOr do something in a\nway that's unpleasant.\nI guess, the example would be\ngetting into the cold water\nthe first thing in the morning.\nAnd making that decision\nfrom under the blankets\nis a rough one for me.\nBut then it gets easier.\nAnd then you wonder, is it\nstill serving the purpose\nthat it's building me up?\nSo should people seek\ntruly bad experiences\nprovided that they're\ndone in a safe way?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nYeah.\nI think that you're\ngoing to, just like you,\nwould develop your\nlegs by doing squats.\nAnd you would develop your\nback by doing pull ups.\nI think you would\ndevelop your resiliency\nby doing repetitions of things\nthat require you to be tougher.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat actually suck.\nOK, good.\nAnd the reason I ask this is\nbecause I think a lot of people\nthink, well, I\nwork out every day.\nBut then you probe them a\nlittle bit, and they're like,\nbut I love exercise.\nAnd then well, then\nthat doesn't quite\nqualify as something\nthat makes you tougher.\nOr they think oh, the last\nreps of a set are really tough.\nBut if you love hitting\nfailure on a set because that's\nwhat I seek in the gym.\nI love that aspect\nof the training.\nThat's actually where I\nknow I'm getting better.\nIt no longer serves as\nresilience training,\nit more just serves as training.\nIn any case, I think\nthat the point is clear,\nand I appreciate your answer.\nI have to ask about something.\nThis is going to seem\nlike a total divergence\nbut it's not, which is animals.\nBecause first of\nall, they're a love\nof mine in terms of\nunderstanding the animal\nkingdom and placing humans\ninto the animal kingdom.\nSecond of all, I\nknow you're a hunter.\nAnd also I know you own dogs.\nAnd the question I have is,\ndo you ever look at people,\nor did you ever work\nin Teams of guys\nwhen you were on active duty--\nsee that the difference\nis you mentioned\nbefore, this person is really\ngood at problem solving,\nthis person's a little\nbit more creative.\nDo you ever wonder\nwhether or not\npeople embody different\nanimal archetypes?\nBecause I do.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Well, that thing\nwhere people say that dogs\nor owners look like their dogs,\ndogs look like their owners,\nI think that's--\nI've seen all kinds of examples.\nYou can go on the\ninternet and find\na bunch of examples\nof dogs that look\nlike their owners and owners\nthat look like their dogs.\nSo I think that's true.\nAnd I think my dog is awesome.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Tell\nme about your dog.\nWhat kind of dog is it?\nJOCKO WILLINK: My dog\nis a German Shepherd.\nHis name is Odin, and\nhe's an awesome dog.\nAnd he's got a personality.\nHe's got an interesting\npersonality.\nSo like he doesn't\nlike to cuddle.\nMy kids will be like oh,\nhe doesn't like to cuddle.\nNo.\nEven when we go to\nbed at night, he\ngoes to 4 feet away\nfrom the foot of my bed.\nEven if I was\nlike, hey, jump up.\nI've told him, jump up in here.\nWe want to pet you.\nHe'll jump up in\nthere, and he just\nlike goes in that\nlow crouch position.\nAnd then waits until\nI say, free dog,\nand then he goes back down,\nand he goes 4 feet away\nfrom the foot of the\nbed and sits there.\nBecause that's\nhis personality is\nto protect, and set\nsecurity, and do his job.\nAnd that's what he's like.\nAnd so you've got\nother dogs that are--\nthey're in a totally\ndifferent mindset.\nSo yeah, dogs have\ndefinite personalities.\nAnd look, I also have--\nit's not all genetic.\nSo two of my friends got\ndogs that were brothers.\nWhat are they called?\nDogo Argentinos.\nYou know those?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, the Dogoes?\nYeah, those are hard\nto get in the US.\nThey're not-- They\nmight not even\nbe legal in the United\nStates, so don't tell me\nwho these people are.\nNot that I care, but I'm\nnot going to report them.\nJOCKO WILLINK: I won't\ntell you who they are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nJOCKO WILLINK: But\nthese two guys--\nand those two guys had\ndifferent personalities.\nOne guy is a very\nhappy-go-lucky,\nlikes to smoke pot, likes\nto hang out, very just\na chill, playful guy.\nThe other guy is not.\nHe's the opposite\nin every category.\nAnd they both got these dogs.\nAnd you fast\nforward like a year,\nthe dog that was owned\nby the playful guy,\nhis dog was just a\nbig puppy licking\nat-- just wagging the tail.\nThe other dog, you had\nto keep it in a cage\nor it would murder\neverything in sight.\nAnd these dogs were brothers\nfrom the same litter,\nand they were\ncompletely opposite.\nAnd so I think it has a lot\nmore to do with nurture than it\ndoes to do with nature.\nBut that being said, when\nyou look at Malinois I mean,\nMalinois have a personality\nthat is very distinct compared\nto a German Shepherd.\nNow, look there's\noutlying Malinois,\nthere's outlying\nGerman Shepherds,\nthere's outlying you name\nwhatever kind of Golden\nRetriever or whatever dog is\nknown for being more playful.\nYou get around the Malinois,\nMalinois are Malinois.\nAnd they're that way.\nHave you been around\nMalinois before?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Mm-hmm.\nOh, uh--\nJOCKO WILLINK: The\nBelgian Malinois?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, a few of them.\nMy neighbor has one, and that\nthing is not terribly friendly.\nBut it's a security dog,\nso I don't expect it to be.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Exactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nyeah, I know they use them\nfor work in the Teams.\nAnd I've heard that you\nhave to keep a close eye\non your relationship with\nthem because if you get lax\nabout it, they'll bite you.\nJOCKO WILLINK: That's for true.\nThe first time I saw one\nwe were doing a drill using\ndogs for the first time.\nAnd then one of the Team\nguide dog handlers came out.\nAnd so we hit this\ntarget building,\nand they prebriefed\nus like, hey, you\nhit this target\nbuilding, and this guy\nis going to be a\nrunner, a squirter.\nAnd so we pull up\nin the Humvees,\nassault team jumps out,\nI'm staying external,\nI want to see what's\ngoing to happen.\nSo the squirter\ngoes running off.\nAnd the dog handler--\nwhatever-- tracks his dog on\nthis guy, and then releases it,\ngives him whatever commands--\n[GROWLS]\n--or whatever the commands are.\nThat thing is totally primed.\nUnlike anything you've\never seen in your life.\nIt is just primed.\nIt's tracking that guy.\nHe hits that release\non that leash,\nand that thing takes off\nat 1,000 miles an hour.\nIt jumps like, I'm\nnot kidding, 15 feet,\nmaybe 10 feet in the air away\nand just chomps onto this dude.\nThe dude goes down.\nIt was freaking awesome.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've seen\nsome videos of those Malinois.\nI guess, I didn't--\nforgive me because\nbefore I didn't\nknow what you were referring\nto Belgian Malinois.\nThose dogs like\nrunning up trees,\njumping over little rivers.\nYeah, it's crazy.\nIncredibly powerful animals.\nYeah.\nWell, the idea that\nthey mimic their owners\nhas me a little concerned\nbecause my last dog,\nI had to put him down.\nIt was my bulldog Costello.\nHe's a Bulldog Mastiff.\nI got him because I went to\npick out a puppy, basically.\nAnd there were eight\nof these bulldogs.\nAnd all of them\nwere running around,\nand then there's one in the\nbackground just eating out\nof all of their bowls.\nAnd I was like, I want that one.\nBig bulldog, biggest\none in the litter.\nLaziest creature.\nNot just dog but laziest\ncreature that ever existed.\nBut if you need to\nactivate, he would.\nHe was just very\nefficient with his energy.\nAnd I don't think I have\na bulldog personality,\nand that's why I got\nhim to balance me out.\nNever retrieved,\nnever did anything.\nStole and destroyed every toy,\nevery dog park in San Diego.\nHe was famous there.\nI had to bring $5 bills to\npay people for all the balls\nand things he would destroy.\nSo anyway, my apologies\nto all the dog owners.\nNot really.\nI miss him.\nDid you train your dog, or\ndid someone else in the house?\nJOCKO WILLINK: I did.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd was he trained\nto be a security dog, or\nfamily dog, or a mixture?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I mean,\nthey're true working dogs.\nUnless you have the time\nand effort to put into him,\nor you buy them that way, you\ndon't want one of those dogs\nthat I was just\ndescribing in your house.\nThey're not for a house\nunless there's that level.\nMy dog is not that level.\nHe's awesome.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you apply\nsome of the same principles\nthat you use in leadership\nof humans with your dog?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, there are\na lot of similar principles,\nbut there's some differences.\nThey're pack animals, and they\nrespond to the pack leader.\nit's funny.\nMy dog obeys me as if\nit's the command of God.\nAnd my wife, he's like\nmaybe I'll do what you say.\nSo they pick up on that stuff.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Dogs\nare very intuitive.\nI love this idea that I\nwas told early on that they\ncan feel your emotions.\nI think they actually can\nsense how we feel not just\nby the intonation of our voice.\nBut I hope someday someone will\nfigure out in a noninvasive way\nbecause I don't like\nthe idea of people\ndoing experiments on\ndogs in an invasive way.\nLike what they're picking up on?\nLike for instance, we know that\nsharks are paying attention\nto the amount of activity\nin the lateral line of fish.\nFish have these\nstretches of neurons\nthat they call the lateral line\nthat allows them to school,\nand know the distance\nto different things,\nand be able to\nsteer around coral.\nThey feel proximity.\nIt would be like if\nyou're turning a corner,\nyou go-- vrrt.\n--and they can even recognize\nspecific lateral line\nsignatures.\nSo it'd be like you and\nMarc Lee walking together\nthrough the dark.\nBut maybe people sift around.\nBut you're like, you don't have\nto look at them, that's Marc.\nYou learn him intuitively.\nA fish can do that.\nSharks can sense whether or\nnot the lateral line is--\nlet's say vibrating but firing\nat a particular frequency\nto know oh, that fish\nis a little bit slower\nthan the rest.\nI mean, hunting\nanimals just they\ndevelop these incredible senses.\nAnd I think humans have\nsome of these senses in more\nrudimentary way.\nWe're just not forced to\nuse them unless, of course,\nyou become a hunter of\nanimals, or a hunter of humans,\nand you tap into these\nneural circuits that\nare very primitive and\nhardwired in everybody.\nBut of course, they're\nhoned in warriors.\nWell, I could spiral off into\nanimal biology in ways that\ntruly would take us 26 hours.\nI don't want to do that.\nI'm almost hesitant\nto ask this question,\nbut I'm going to do it anyway.\nMany times online, you\nare asked whether or not\nyou will run for office?\nAnd I want to say that I\nthink it's a true compliment.\nI don't think people are asking\njust to entertain themselves.\nI think that this\ncountry certainly\nand a lot of the world is\ndesperate for certain kinds\nof leaders and people\nthat have experience\nin high risk, high consequence,\nchaotic situations,\nand have shown prowess at\nleadership in multiple domains.\nAnd you are certainly\none of those individuals.\nAnd so they ask for that\nreason among others.\nAnd I've heard you\ngive your answer,\nand you can repeat\nit again here.\nBut as a more broad theme that I\nthink people are interested in,\ndo you think it's an\nimportant criteria\nor it would be\ngreat to see people\nin positions of leadership\nwho've had wartime experience?\nAnd do you think that some\nof the shifts that we've\nseen in terms of\npatterns of leadership\nover the last-- let's\njust make it real broad\nso that this isn't related\nto any particular person\nor stretch of history--\nbut over the last,\nlet's just say 25\nyears, reflect the fact\nthat we haven't\nseen a lot of that,\nat least at the top\ntiers of leadership?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I think\nit'd be excellent if people--\nif the president had\nmilitary experience for sure.\nI think that then they\nunderstand the way\nthe military works better.\nThey understand that each--\nthe civilians that control\nthe military.\nBecause a lot of times\npeople that are civilians\ndon't understand that the\ncivilians control the military.\nAnd I think that you do get to\nappreciate what war actually is\nand what the costs are.\nI think that I've seen in\nthe same vein of people\nasking me to run for\npolitical office,\nI've heard, seen\ncomments saying, oh,\nthat's what we\nneed, another war--\na warmonger in office.\nAnd I've responded\na few of those.\nI think if there's any group\nof people that don't want war,\nit's people that have seen it.\nPeople that understand\nwhat the sacrifices are.\nAnd I think that\nbeing in the military,\npeople understand that better.\nSo yeah, I think it'd be\na great qualification.\nI don't think it's mandatory.\nI mean, clearly it's not.\nWe've had a bunch of\npresidents that haven't ever\nserved anything.\nReally, we've had a bunch of\npresidents that haven't ever\nserved anything but themselves.\nSo yeah, hopefully, we'll\nget some more people that\nhave some experience\nin the military,\nsome combat experience\nwould be especially nice.\nAnd that would be\ngood in my opinion.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well\nI'm certainly not one\nto tell people what to do,\nand I'm certainly not going\nto tell you what to do.\nBut should you\never choose to run,\nI would certainly be very\nenthusiastic about that.\nAnd I will just say\nthat with that stated,\nI hope people do hear\nwhat you just said.\nI share that sentiment.\nPeople who have led others\nbesides themselves, I think\nis the key statement there.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nAnd look, I just--\nI have friends that\nare politicians,\nand I really appreciate\nwhat they're doing.\nAnd it looks miserable to me.\nI don't like what--\ngood for them.\nI'm happy that they're in there\ntrying to make a difference.\nAnd I guess, this is me being\nselfish of me saying, look,\nI don't think I\ncould stomach that.\nAnd I also think that right\nnow, I'm trying to help out.\nFor instance, we have\nobviously got the leadership\nconsulting in\nEchelon Front, we're\ntrying to help businesses grow.\nI've got Origin\nUSA, we're bringing\nmanufacturing back to America.\nWe've got 100, 400,\n450 employees right\nnow that are here in\nAmerica working and growing\nthat business.\nObviously, that\nsupplements-- so everything\nthat I'm doing here right\nnow is to try and move\nthe needle with America.\nBringing manufacturing back,\nhelping the economy as much\nas I can right now.\nSo that's what I'm\ndoing right now.\nAnd my standard answer,\nwhich you alluded to,\nis if things got\nbad enough, then\nI would do what I had to do.\nBut I don't think people\nappreciate my level of bad.\nI'm talking real bad.\nSo it's not there yet.\nAnd hopefully, it\nnever will get there.\nI'd rather surf and\nhang out with my friends\nand hang out with my\nfamily than do that.\nAnd hopefully, America can\nfind some level of balance.\nI think that's the problem\nthat we're having right now.\nAnd a lot of these things\nthat you talked about,\nspecifically the thing\nyou talked about,\nsocial media is not very\ngood for political balance.\nIt's actually horrible\nfor political balance,\nand a lot of it has to\ndo with just the way\nthat those\nconversations are had.\nA lot of it has to do with ego\nas well because I don't ever\nwant to admit that I'm\nwrong about anything.\nAnd if I can find\nsomething that I\nthink you might be\nwrong about, it's\nso satisfying to my ego to\njust call you out on that thing\nand attack you.\nAnd I think that's what a lot\nof people are doing right now.\nNow, that being said, I also\nusually say this as well.\nI travel around the\ncountry all the time.\nI work with companies\nof all sizes, work\nwith people in every\ndifferent industry.\nAnd they're not sitting\naround arguing with each other\nabout the political scenery.\nThey're talking about, hey,\nhow can we grow our business?\nHow can we take\ncare of our workers?\nHow can we take\ncare of our clients?\nHow can we take care\nof our customer?\nThat's what people\nare focused on.\nAnd when you jump\non social media,\nyou can get sucked into the\npolitical scene very easily.\nAnd that being said,\nalso we do have\nto pay attention\nbecause we as citizens\nhave to make sure\nthat America stays\non the correct path within\nthe guardrails of what\nthis country is based on.\nSo we do have to pay attention.\nBut I will be doing\nmy part as a civilian\nuntil there's total mayhem\nand chaos in the streets.\nThen I'll probably just\nbe a benevolent dictator\nthat takes over.\n[LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Should be\nan interesting one, but, hey,\nyou would be the man to\nlead under any conditions.\nBut thank you for\nstating your threshold.\nCertainly, you've\nearned the right\nto make whatever decision is\nthat you feel is right for you.\nAnd I want to say that I agree.\nI feel like we are a\ncountry that still includes\na ton of generators\nand a ton of projectors\nthat are interested\nin projecting the good\nand growing the good.\nI do believe both those\nphenotypes are important.\nI also want to\njust say thank you\nfor being a generator of\nso much useful knowledge.\nIn science, we have a saying,\nwhich is somebody is an n of 1.\nThis is a rare thing\nto hear about oneself\nor to hear about somebody\nbecause what it means\nis that somebody is in a\ncategory in which pretty\nmuch everything that\nthey do and they say\nmatters and serves\na purpose, which\nis a useful and important\nbuilding purpose.\nAnd I will look at you and tell\nyou that you are an n of 1.\nYou certainly would meet that\ncriteria under any conditions.\nAnd it's evident in\nthe many companies\nthat you're running and the\nleadership that you're doing.\nAnd also in your\nonline presence.\nI mean, that's how I initially\ncame to learn about you.\nI'm now fortunate to have two\nlengthy conversations with you\nand a few interspersed as well.\nAnd I think of myself as\na reasonable perhaps good\nobserver of how people\nbehave in different domains.\nAnd every time you post,\nor every time you speak,\nor every time you go on a\npodcast or host a podcast,\nit's clear that not\nonly are you prepared\nand not only are you approaching\nit with a spirit of seriousness\nthat it deserves\nbut sometimes also\nlightness that it deserves.\nBut there's always\nan element of give\nand that you're trying to\nencourage people to do better\nfor themselves.\nSo as somebody who's greatly\nbenefited from the knowledge\nthat you've put out there from\nthe very first Tim Ferriss\nand Joe Rogan episodes\nto your own podcast,\nI want to extend\na personal thanks.\nI also want to\nextend great thanks\nfor coming on here\ntoday, talking\nto a geek scientist\nwho also happens\nto be a fellow punk rocker.\nBecause that spirit and\nthe heart that's behind it,\nI think some people think it's\nall about noise and chaos,\nit's actually about being\nreally true to yourself.\nThat's how I think about\nthe punk rock spirit.\nIt's really about\nbeing true to yourself\nand realizing that the\nthing that you like,\nwhile it might be\nquite different,\nis actually, if that's you,\nyou have to live in that vein\nand stick with it.\nIt certainly served\nme well, and it\nsounds like it served you well.\nBut mostly I just want to\nextend an enormous thank you.\nAs a civilian, thank\nyou for the work\nyou did in the military\nbut also teaching people\nabout the military.\nI think a lot of\npeople don't realize\nwhat it's about at any level.\nAnd learning about\nyour experience\nthere, and what you've\nobserved, bringing\nother people's experiences\nfrom the military more broadly\nis super important.\nAnd sharing this and\nbeing able to entertain\nsome of my scientific riffs.\nSo thank you, thank\nyou, thank you.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Well,\nI appreciate it.\nit's weird you say all\nthese nice things to me.\nI definitely don't deserve them.\nI'm a regular dude\nthat just showed up,\nI guess, at the right\ntime and told some stories\nabout some guys that\nwere true heroes,\nand just trying to\nshare my perspective.\nBut it's not just\nmy perspective,\nI'm talking about\nstories that I lived.\nBut there's plenty\nof people that\nhave done way more\nthan I've ever\ndone and sacrificed infinitely\nmore than I ever sacrificed.\nSo I'm thankful for being here.\nI know that you put all kinds\nof information and the same back\nat you.\nI have greatly benefited\nfrom the information\nthat you put out.\nAnd so I thank you as well.\nAnd I appreciate coming\non here and appreciate\nyou spreading the word about how\npeople can be better yourself.\nSo thanks for having me.\nI appreciate it, man.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI appreciate you,\nand
