    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast, where\nwe discuss science and science\nbased tools for everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are\ndiscussing creativity.\nCreativity is a topic that to\nmany people is very abstract.\nThat is, we know when something\nseems creative, some of us\nknow people who are creative\nor perhaps are creative,\nand yet the ability to be\ncreative resides in everybody.\nAnd we know that because\nthe neural circuits\nthat underlie creativity\nhave been somewhat defined\nand the steps and processes\nwithin the brain and body that\nlead to creativity\nare well known.\nThat said, most people don't\nknow how to access creativity.\nAnd if they do know how\nto access creativity,\nthey are only able\nto access creativity\nin a fairly limited\nnumber of domains of life.\nFor instance, in the visual arts\nor in music or within science\nor engineering or any number\nof different domains ranging\nfrom the kitchen to sport\nto childhood interactions.\nThat is, childhood games.\nIn other words, some\nadults are able to access\ntheir creative spirit when\nengaging in childlike play\nwith children or for\nthat matter with adults.\nBut as it turns out,\nall of creativity\nstems from just a small\nsubset of neural structures\nin the brain that\nneed to be activated\nin a particular\nsequence or order.\nToday we will talk about what\nthose neural structures are,\nwhat particular order they need\nto be activated in in order\nto come up with, for instance,\nnew ideas that are creative,\nand then how to implement\nthose creative strategies.\nWe will also talk\nabout different ways\nto access creativity\nthat include--\nnarrative and storytelling as\nwell as applying new rule sets\nor even entirely new worldviews.\nAnd we will do this in\na structured way that\nwill allow anyone, whether\nor not you consider yourself\ncreative or not to\nbe able to apply\nthese tools in different domains\nof life-- work, family, play,\nand on and on.\nBy the end of\ntoday's episode, you\nwill have a better understanding\nof what creativity is\nand how to access it.\nAnd if you like to bring others\ninto your creative endeavors\nwhich as you'll soon\nlearn can massively\nexpand the extent to\nwhich you yourself\ncan express your\ncreative talents.\nAs is the case with all episodes\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\ntoday we will discuss\nboth scientific mechanisms\nand nomenclature.\nAnd I promise to make\nall of that clear to you\neven if you don't have\na background in biology\nor psychology.\nBut we will also, of\ncourse, discuss tools.\nThat is, specific steps\nthat you can take in order\nto be more creative.\nOne particular tool that I'm\nexcited to share with you\ninvolves a meditation, but this\nis a very unusual meditation.\nThis is not sitting with eyes\nclosed focusing on your breath\nor focusing on a chime\nor some other feature\nin your sensory environment\nor even in your body.\nLater we will talk about\nopen monitoring meditations.\nOpen monitoring meditations are\nvery distinct from other forms\nof meditation and\ninvolve learning\nhow to sit back\nand simply observe\nyour thoughts\nwhile intentionally\nvarying where your thoughts go.\nSo for those of you\nthat find it a struggle\nto focus or to refocus in more\ntraditional forms of meditation\nor maybe even in your work\nand even for those of you that\nmay suffer from things\nlike ADHD or similar,\nopen monitoring meditation can\nbe an extremely valuable tool\nfor accessing your\ncreative abilities.\nBecause of the\nways that it allows\nyou to tap into\nspecific circuits\nwithin the frontal\nnetworks of your brain,\nso these are networks\nof the brain that\ninclude the areas just\nbehind your forehead\nand that allow you to evaluate\nnew and novel rule sets\nin a very unconstrained way.\nBecause if you think\nabout it, creativity\nis really the ability to\ntake existing elements\nfrom the physical world or from\nthe thought world, if you will,\nor from any domain of life,\nmood, thinking, and information\nand to reorder those into\nnovel combinations that\nare useful for something.\nAnd as we'll also\nfind out later,\ncreativity has this\nincredible aspect to it,\nwhich is that when we see or\ncreate or experience something\nthat is truly creative,\nit reveals to us something\nfundamental about the way\nthat the natural world\nand indeed the way\nthat our brains work.\nIf that sounds very mysterious\nand abstract to you now,\nI promise that by the\nend of today's episode,\nyou will not only\nunderstand what that means\nbut you will also understand\nhow to use open monitoring\nmeditations as well as other\nforms of tools in order\nto access your creative ability.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses\nand sunglasses\nthat are the absolute\nhighest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything\nabout ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology\nof the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that\nyour visual system has\nto contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges for you\nto be able to see clearly.\nFor instance, when you move from\na shady area to a sunny area.\nThere are all\nadaptations that have\nto occur in your eye and brain.\nROKA understands\nthese adaptations.\nAnd the other ones\nrequired to see clearly.\nAnd those are built into the\nengineering of their sunglasses\nand eyeglasses.\nOne of the things that makes\nROKA eyeglasses in sunglasses\nso terrific, is that they\nare extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the\ntime I don't even\nrealize that they're on my face.\nI wear sunglasses when\nI drive and whenever\nI need to throughout the day\nand I wear readers at night.\nI do not wear sunglasses when I\nget my morning sunlight, which\nI do every single morning\nas you should be doing also\nas is covered many\ntimes on this podcast.\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nare also unique in that\nunlike a lot of so-called\nperformance eyeglasses\nout there.\nThey don't make you\nlook like a cyborg.\nThey have some of\nthe styles that\nmake you look like a cyborg,\nif that's your thing.\nBut if you want to wear\nglasses or sunglasses out\nto dinner or around\nfor social reasons,\nthey have many different\naesthetic styles\nto choose from.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\ngo to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A\n.com and enter the code\nHuberman to save\n20% off your order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nat checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd as you may have\nheard me say before,\nI am not a fan of\nthe word nootropics\nbecause it means smart drugs.\nAnd frankly, there\nis no neural circuit\nin the brain for being\nquote unquote \"smart.\"\nThere are neural\ncircuits for focus.\nThere are neural circuits\nfor task switching.\nThere are neural circuits\nfor today's topic,\nwhich is creativity.\nNootropics therefore\nis not a great word\nto describe any\nsupplement or drug that\ncan enhance brain function\nbecause it lacks specificity.\nThesis understands\nthis and therefore has\ndesigned custom nootropics\nthat are tailored\nto your specific needs and that\nallow you to enter the brain\nand bodily states that are\noptimal for things like focus,\nenergy, creativity, and so on.\nIf you'd like to try your own\npersonalized nootropic starter\nkit, go online to take\nthesis.com/Huberman.\nTake their brief\nthree minute quiz.\nAnd Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAgain, that's take\nthesis.com/huberman and use\nthe code Huberman at checkout\nfor 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an\nelectrolyte drink that\ncontains everything you need\nthat is sodium, magnesium,\nand potassium in\nthe precise ratios\nthat you need without sugar.\nAs I talked about many\ntimes before on this podcast\nand elsewhere, every\ncell in your body\nrequires hydration\nand electrolytes\nin order to function properly.\nAnd a key example of this are\nthe neurons, the nerve cells\nof your brain that allow\nyou to think clearly,\nto exercise hard, et cetera.\nNeurons require sodium\nin order to fire\nwhat are called\naction potentials\nor electrical signaling\nbetween neurons.\nAnd they require\npotassium and magnesium.\nAnd those have to be present\nin the correct ratios in order\nfor your brain and body\nto function optimally.\nLMNT is formulated\nto help anyone\nwith their electrolyte needs.\nAnd is perfectly suited\nto anyone following\na ketogenic, low carbohydrate,\nor Paleolithic diet,\nor a basic omnivore diet which\nis the one that I follow.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drink element\nthat's lmnt.com/huberman to\nclaim a free element sample\npack with your purchase.\nAnd right now LMNT has\ntwo special flavors\nfor the holidays--\nchocolate caramel and mint\nchocolate, which I should\nmention taste especially good\nif you actually heat it up.\nSo if you treat it\nlike a tea, it works.\nOr if you drink it\ncold it's delicious.\nAll the flavors of\nLMNT I find delicious.\nAgain, you can go\nto drink element,\nthat's lmnt.com/Huberman.\nThe Huberman Lab\npodcast is now partnered\nwith Momentous supplements.\nTo find the supplements we\ndiscuss on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, you can go to\nlivemomentous spelled\nO-U-S, livemomentous/huberman.\nAnd I should just\nmention that the Library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about creativity.\nNow on the face of it, the word\ncreativity and creative acts\nmight seem somewhat\nabstract to us.\nThat is, we know\nwhen we see something\nthat we consider creative and\nwe know when we see something\nthat is not creative.\nThings that aren't\ncreative are things\nthat we see every day, a car\nwith four tires, for instance,\na bicycle with two\ntires, not creative.\nHowever, we also see things that\nare novel that are different\nand that we don't really\nthink of as creative.\nIn fact, they can be\ndownright trivial.\nFor instance, if I were\nto take a fish tank\nand put wings on it,\nthat's a novel combination\nof things, which is\none of the key criteria\nfor an act or an object\nor a piece of music\nthat is creative.\nAnd yet, neither of\nus I believe would\nfind it very creative\nor very interesting\nthat a fish tank\nhas wings on it.\nWhy or why not I should say?\nWell, it turns out\nthat for something\nto be creative it actually\nhas to reveal to us something\nfundamental about the\nworld or about how we work.\nAnd I must say that oftentimes\nthe most creative and the most\ninteresting and the most\nbeloved creative acts\nreveal to us something\nfundamental about the world\nor the way that we work in a\nway that delights and thrills\nand surprise prizes us but\nthat we aren't even aware what\nthat fundamental rule is.\nI'll return to this\nin a few minutes.\nBut for the time being,\nlet's just build up\nfrom first principles what\nconstitutes something creative\nand what does not constitute\nsomething creative.\nCreativity is a way of\ninteracting with the world\nor combining or recombining\nthings in the world\nin a way that appears novel\nto us and to other people.\nMy example of a fish tank\nwith wings on it is novel.\nBut frankly, it's\nnot very creative\nand it's not very interesting.\nIt doesn't reveal\nanything new to us.\nSure there are flying fish\nalthough they just jump far,\nthey don't really fly.\nAnd as a consequence,\nputting wings on a fish tank\ncould be used as a metaphor for\nthe fact that fish don't fly.\nBut you already\nknew and I already\nknew that fish don't fly.\nAnd so there's\nnothing novel revealed\nto us about the world except\nsomething we already knew.\nNow, creative acts on the\nother hand, of course,\ninvolve novel combinations\nof existing rule sets that\ncould be different combinations\nof music or colors or shapes\nor technology, et cetera.\nBut it does so in a way\nthat tells us something\nfundamental and different.\nLet me give an example of a few\ntruly creative artistic acts.\nAnd I'll do that in the domain\nof visual arts but, of course,\nthere are many\nexamples that could\ncome from music or from other\ndomains sport, et cetera.\nThe examples I'll give rather\nthan a fish tank with wings\nare for instance, the\ncomparison between a drawing\nor a very accurate painting\nof a face, an Escher\npainting, and a Banksy.\nIf you don't know what\nthose are I'll explain.\nFirst of all, let's talk about\nan accurate representation\nof a face.\nIf I were to sit\nyou down or if you\nwere to send me a\nphotograph and then\nI were to paint\nor draw a picture\nof your face in a way that\nfaithfully represented,\nthe position and shape of your\nnose relative to the eyes,\nmaybe a curl of the\nlip, maybe a few hairs\nof your eyebrows in a\nparticular way, that\nreally captured you accurately.\nI think most people would\nsay, OK, it's accurate.\nIt looks a lot like the\nphotograph or the person.\nAnd on the one hand why\nthat could be interesting\nit's not particularly\ncreative because it faithfully\nrepresents what's already there.\nIn contrast, a painting or\na picture like an Escher,\nand for those of you that aren't\nfamiliar with Escher's involves\na lot of repeating patterns.\nSo for instance, a bird image\nthat's repeated over and over\nand over and over\nagain, sometimes\nin partially overlapping manner.\nAnd perhaps a building\nthat's repeated over and over\nand over again or stones\nrepeated over and over again\nor staircases over\nand over again.\nEscher's capture elements\nfrom the outside world\nand faithfully represent them,\nbut faithfully represent them\nover and over and over again,\nwhich is not typically seen\nin the natural world.\nIn fact, most of what\nour visual system does\nis to eliminate repetitive\npatterns when we see them.\nIn fact, most of what\nour visual system does\nis try and make us blind\nto repetitive patterns\nin our visual\nenvironment and only\nallow us to see things\nthat are unusual\nin that visual environment.\nNow, this is especially\ntrue at visual scales.\nWhat I mean by that is if\nyou were to go to the beach\nand lie on your towel and\nlook down at the sand,\nyou would start to notice\nthat the sand is a very, very\nrepetitive pattern.\nSo at very small scales and in\nparticular at molecular scales\nwhen you get down to the\nlevel of atoms and so forth,\neverything is repetitive.\nIt's the same thing,\nis just reproduced\nin different combinations\nover and over again.\nBut as we move\nthrough our world,\ntypically we're not looking\ndown at pebbles on the ground\nor little grains of sand\nor the pattern of leaves\nin a particular clover or\nsomething of that sort.\nMost of the time\nwe're looking out\non landscapes or at\npeople's faces, et cetera.\nAnd very seldom do we see\nhighly repetitive patterns\nat that scale.\nSo what Escher's do\nis they essentially\nreveal to us a\nfundamental feature\nabout the way that our\nvisual system works,\nwhich is that repetitive\npatterns tend to become noise\nin our visual system.\nThat is, our brain encodes\nrepetition as things\nnot to be interested in.\nAnd the things that stand\nout against that repetition\nas the things to be interested\nin so-called signal to noise.\nWhat Escher's do is they invert\nthe relationship between signal\nand noise and they make the\nrepetitive patterns the signal\nand the unusual\npatterns the noise.\nIn fact, in every Escher\nthere are unusual patterns\nand those completely\ndisappear to us.\nNow, when you look at an\nEscher, what you probably see\nand what I see are just a bunch\nof birds repeated over and over\nagain or buildings or staircases\nrepeated over and over again.\nAnd you may like\nEscher's and you may not,\nthat's not the point.\nToday we're not\ntalking about taste\nin particular creative acts.\nWhat we're trying\nto identify here\nare the rules and mechanisms\nof what constitutes something\ncreative and why it's creative.\nAnd the key element here is that\nwhat's revealed by an Escher\nthrough these\nrepetition patterns\nis an inversion of the way\nthat our brain normally\nencodes visual images.\nAnd therefore, the\nrule that repetition\nis suppressed in\nour visual system\nand that unusual visual features\nare revealed to us, that rule\nis what pops out to us\nwhen we look at an Escher.\nNow, when I say pops out I don't\nmean that you look at an Escher\nand go oh, normally I\ndon't see repetition,\nnormally I see the unusual\nstuff, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut there seems to be something\nabout truly creative acts\nthat capture the attention.\nAnd sometimes the delight\nof many, many people\nis that they reveal a\nfundamental rule about how\nthe brain or the world works.\nLet me give you a\ndifferent example\nalso from the visual art world.\nLet me give you the\nexample of Banksy.\nBanksy is an artist that many of\nyou are probably familiar with\nand probably some of you\nare not familiar with.\nSo for those of you that are\nnot familiar with Banksy,\nBanksy is an artist\nthat most often\ndoes two dimensional artwork.\nSo these would be stencils\nor paintings or drawings\nlike many artists and does\nthem in an urban landscape,\nan actual city or\nsuburban landscape.\nThat is, he draws or stencils or\ngraffiti in a very cryptic way,\nI should say.\nNo one really knows who Banksy\nis or when he does his art.\nHe just reveals his\nart by putting it up.\nBut he does this in\nthe context of cities\nand on three\ndimensional objects.\nSo a good example would be he\nwill stencil next to a phone\nbooth a police officer.\nOr he will graffiti next\nto an actual fire hydrant\na dog lifting its leg to\nurinate on that fire hydrant.\nNow, what's interesting about\nBanksy's is not simply the fact\nthat he puts two dimensional art\nonto three dimensional surfaces\nin the urban and\nsuburban landscape\nbecause if you think\nabout it, that's been\ndone many, many times before.\nAll graffiti is that.\nAll City Art and murals is that.\nSo what's unique about Banksy?\nWhat's unique about\nBanksy or I should\nsay Banksy's, the actual\nart, is that he combines\ntwo dimensional art with a three\ndimensional landscape in a way\nthat the concept\npops out at you.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, in the case of\nthe dog lifting its leg\nto urinate on the fire hydrant,\nthat's a scene that most people\nand in fact, most children are\nfamiliar with from cartoons\nor from our basic understanding\nof the stereotype of dogs\nand I must tell you having\nowned a male dog, a bulldog\nCostello for many years.\nHydrants were a particular\ntarget for Costello.\nOf course, everything\nwas a particular target\nfor Costello urinating outdoors.\nNonetheless, he liked\nto pee on fire hydrants.\nThat itself is not interesting.\nSeeing a photograph of\na dog raising its leg\nto pee on a fire hydrant\nis not interesting.\nSeeing a painting of\nthat isn't interesting.\nSeeing an actual dog\nurinating on a fire hydrant\nisn't interesting.\nIn fact, seeing a painting in\ntwo dimensions of a dog raising\nits leg to, of course,\nit can't actually\nurinate but give you the\nimpression that it would\nurinate on that fire\nhydrant isn't particularly\ninteresting except for the fact\nthat it reveals to us something\nfundamental, which\nis that we tend\nto pair visual relationships\nbetween different objects\nthat share a common\ntheme and then\nthe theme tends to pop out us.\nSo, for instance,\nthe dog raising\nits leg next to a\nfire hydrant even\nif the dog is drawn\nin two dimensions\nand the fire hydrant\nis in three dimensions\nallows the concept of\ndog and fire hydrant\nto emerge or pop out at us,\nwhich reveals to us something\nfundamental about\nhow our brain works,\nwhich is that our brain encodes\nconcepts and entire stories\nas symbols of interaction\nbetween different objects.\nLet me give you a\ndifferent example just\nto make sure that\nthis hits home.\nOne of Banksy's more\nfamous paintings\nis a rather politically\ncharged one,\nwhich is of a girl holding\na bouquet of balloons.\nAnd this two dimensional drawing\nwas put on to the West wall\ndividing territories\nin the Middle East.\nA very controversial issue.\nThe controversies\nof that issue are\nnot what I want to get into.\nBut I don't think\nanyone would doubt\nthat is a controversial issue.\nThe two dimensional\ndrawing of the girl\nwith the balloons\non the actual wall\nturns out to be quite\ninteresting as an art piece\nbecause what it reveals to\nus is the entire controversy\naround the presence of\nthat wall and the desire\nfor certain people to breach\nthat wall and the desire\nfor other people to insist\nthat that wall not be breached\nfor whatever reason.\nAgain, this is not about\nthe particular controversy,\nthe point is that a two\ndimensional image combined\nwith a three\ndimensional structure\nallows the purpose of that\nthree dimensional structure.\nAnd the controversy around that\nthree dimensional structure\nto pop out at us in a way that\nif, for instance, we had just\nseen a photograph of\nsomebody next to that wall\nor with a ladder\nor if we just seen\na drawing of a girl holding\na bouquet of balloons\non a drawing of that\nwall to not emerge.\nIn other words, it captures\ntwo fundamental features\nof the visual system.\nOur ability to encode\nthings in two dimensions\nand understand symbols.\nAnd our ability to understand\nthings in three dimensions.\nAnd in particular, the wall\nas a three dimensional object\nis really interesting\nbecause it's\nan actual physical barrier.\nSo showing it as the\nactual physical barrier\nthat it is in real space,\nin three dimensions\nturns out to allow the\ninteraction between those two\nthings.\nThe concept, the controversy\nto pop out at us and make us\nthink about that particular\ncontroversy and perhaps\nwhere we each individually\nstand on that controversy.\nNow, there are many\nexamples of what I just\ngave in the visual domain.\nFor instance, Rothko's\nwhich are just\ncolor on Canvas are\nparticularly interesting source\nof information about the way\nthat the brain encodes color.\nLater I'll fill in exactly\nwhat that information is.\nYou may like\nRothko's, you may not.\nBut I'll tell you one thing.\nWhen you look at\na Rothko, you are\nseeing colors in a\nvery different way\nthan you would ever see\ncolors in any other context.\nThe fact that they don't\nhave a frame typically\nand the fact that\nthere's no white canvas\nallows the colors\nthat you see to be\nnovel hues of those\ncolors that you will not\nsee in any other context.\nAnd in doing so\nreveals to you what\nyour brain does in order to\nunderstand and extract color.\nNow in the context of\nmusic, for instance,\nyou will sometimes hear a\nstreet musician play a song\nmaybe a Bob Dylan song or a Led\nZeppelin song or a Pink Floyd\nsong pretty closely, pretty\naccurately to the way\nthat song is played.\nBut, of course,\nthat's not creative.\nThat's just like the photograph\nor the accurate portrait\nof somebody's face.\nOr you may hear an\nacoustic version\nof what's normally an electric\nguitar song or electrical song\nor vise versa.\nSomewhat creative,\nsometimes sounds\neven better than the original\nbut not particularly creative.\nHowever, each and\nevery one of us\nhas a particular taste in music.\nMaybe it's classical, maybe\nit's rock, maybe it's punk,\nmaybe it's hip hop.\nWithin each of those\ngenres, I think all of us\nare familiar with hearing\nsomething for the first time\nand maybe even every time.\nAnd there's something\nabout the combination\nof the words and the\nmusic or sometimes\njust the music or just the words\nthat allows some feature of it\nto pop out at us as\nparticularly exciting.\nAnd when we feel that\nexcitement and we\nfeel that it's\nreally novel, it's\ndifferent than what we've\nheard before, I assure you\nwhat it's revealing\nto you is the way\nthat your auditory\nsystem and often\nyour auditory and\nyour emotional system\nencodes information\nthat you hear.\nAnd again, the rule\nthat it's revealing\nis not splayed out for you.\nFor instance, it's\nnot told to you\noh, this is the way\nyou normally hear\nand now you're hearing\nthings differently.\nSometimes it's the\nchange in for instance\nin the way that\nwords are accented\nor the way the sentences\nare constructed.\nThis often you'll hear\nin hip hop the way\nthat sentences are\nconstructed can be divided up\nnot as normal declarative\nsentences the way\nthat they're typically written.\nBut the way that sentences\nare chopped up and fractured\nreveals to us new meaning\nand in fact, enhanced\nmeaning about particular\nwords that we wouldn't\nsee if it was written\nout as a paragraph\nand then sung as a script that\nwould be the same as the one\nthat we would read.\nAgain, the point is that what\nis exciting and novel to you is\njust the way that you hear it.\nBut it's exciting\nand novel to you\nbecause there are circuits\nwithin the brain that when\nwe hear or see or\nfeel or experience\nknown elements in new ways\nthat are truly creative,\nthe way that those neural\ncircuits function is changed.\nAnd when neural\ncircuits change the way\nthat they function\nsimply by way of what\ncomes into our eyes,\nour ears, and the way\nthat we experience\nour feelings, there\nis the release of\nchemicals, including\nthe release of the\nchemical dopamine\nand other\nneuromodulators as well\nthat make us feel both\nsurprised, delighted.\nAnd this is very key,\nexcited in anticipation\nthat we might see it again.\nSo with the\nunderstanding in mind\nthat true creativity\ninvolves the l combination\nof some elements could be notes\nof music, could be numbers,\ncould be visual elements\nlike lines or colors,\ncould be physical\nmovements, et cetera.\nBut novel combinations\nof some things\nthat reveal to us something\nfundamental about the way\nthat our brain and/or\nthe world work.\nAnd of course, as\nI mentioned before,\nthat fundamental\nthing may or may not\nbe consciously accessible to us.\nWe may not know what exactly\nit is that's novel to us.\nBut it feels novel\nand it feels true.\nWell, with that\nunderstanding in mind,\nwe therefore can ask,\nwhat are the underlying\nprinciples and\nneural circuits that\nunderlie the creative process.\nAnd the word process here\nis especially important.\nIn fact, if there's\none thing I'd really\nlike to impress on\neverybody is that when\nthinking about biology,\nit's almost always better\nto think about verbs\nas opposed to nouns.\nSo rather than\nthink of creativity\nas a noun or somebody being\ncreative as an adjective,\nthink about the verb creativity.\nThat is what are\nthe steps required\nand therefore what are the\ncells and circuits and thoughts,\net cetera required in\norder to be creative.\nThis element of\nthinking about verbs\nthen allows us to say, OK, what\nare the various steps in coming\nup with a creative idea,\nin testing a creative idea,\nand then implementing\nthat creative idea.\nAnd in doing so, we find based\non the scientific literature\nthat there are basically\nthree major networks\nwithin the brain, each of\nwhich is responsible for each\nof the three steps to arrive\nat something truly creative.\nThe first neural circuit\ninvolved in creativity\nis the so-called\nexecutive network.\nThis is a goofy name because\nthe neural circuits that I'm\nabout to describe do a bunch\nof other things as well,\nbut they certainly control what\nare called executive functions.\nExecutive functions\nare functions\nthat you and I both have,\nwhich is our ability\nto govern our thinking\nand our behavior\nin very deliberate ways.\nAnd that is largely\naccomplished through the use\nof the neural circuitry\nthat sits right\nbehind the forebrain, the\nso-called prefrontal cortex.\nNow, the prefrontal\ncortex involves\nmany different subregions.\nIt has a bunch of\ndifferent parts\njust like any country has\ndifferent states, et cetera\nand provinces.\nExecutive function involves\nthe prefrontal cortex\nand some other\nneural structures.\nBut for the sake\nof this discussion,\nexecutive function and\nthe prefrontal cortex\nare mainly responsible\nfor suppressing action.\nThat is, for eliminating choices\namong the infinite number\nof choices that exist.\nFor instance, of what colors\nto combine on a painting\nor what lines to draw\nor what notes to play\nor what movements\nto make in a sports\nendeavor, what numbers to\ninclude in a mathematics\nendeavor, or what words\nand letters and syllables\nand sentences to include in\nwriting a creative passage.\nThe second network is the\nso-called default mode network.\nThere's a lot of discussion\nnowadays about the default mode\nnetwork as it relates to\nconsciousness and meditation,\net cetera.\nThe default mode network\ndoes many different things.\nBut in the context of our\ndiscussion about creativity,\nthe default mode\nnetwork is really\nthe network that\nstarts being engaged\nwhen you close your eyes\nand start paying attention\nto what's going on in terms\nof your thinking as opposed\nto the sensory outside world.\nAnd the default mode network is\nespecially important for what's\ncalled spontaneous imagination.\nNow, spontaneous\nimagination is something\nthat you can try at any moment\nif you were to close your eyes\nand to try and not pay attention\nto the sounds around you.\nBut even if you do, to just\npay attention to whatever\nthoughts or feelings emerge\nwhen your eyes are closed.\nBy closing your eyes\nand shutting yourself\noff to the outside\nsensory world,\nyou start to engage much\nmore of your brain machinery\ndedicated towards\nwhat's going on\ninside you, so-called\ninteroception but also\nwhat you're thinking\nabout your thinking\nwhether or not your thoughts\nare complete or incomplete,\nwhether or not they are\nfragmentary in a way that goes\nfrom one thought to another\ndistantly in the past\nor present to future, et cetera.\nDepending on time of\nday, how well-rested\nyou are, how stressed you\nare, how happy you are,\nthe default mode\nnetwork will take you\nthrough a journey of\ndifferent types of thoughts,\ndifferent types of\nfeelings, et cetera.\nThe specific types of\nthoughts and feelings\nare not as interesting\nas the fact\nthat when you close your\neyes you're essentially\nengaging this default mode\nnetwork, which is essentially\nthe network associated with\nimagination and imagination\nbased on elements that exist\nonly within your head, that\nis within your brain and\ntherefore must rely on memory\nof previous experiences.\nAs soon as you close your\neyes, you are shutting yourself\noff from the sensory world.\nSo by definition\nyou can no longer\nbe bringing in novel\nexperiences in that moment.\nYou're relying on your library\nof existing experiences\nand your memory of those in\norder to imagine new things.\nAnd you're doing this in a\nvery free associative way.\nYou're not trying to\nimagine new things.\nIt's just whatever\ngeysers to the surface.\nSo we've got the\nexecutive network,\nwhich is involved in suppressing\nparticular thoughts or actions.\nWe have the default\nmode network, which\nis involved in imagination.\nAnd the default mode network\nI should mention also\ninvolves a subregion of\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nIt's called the medial\nprefrontal cortex\nbut other brain regions as well.\nAnd then the final\nelement within\nthe circuits\nunderlying creativity\nis the so-called\nsalience network.\nThe salience network is a\nnetwork of brain regions\nthat involves areas such as\nthe Insula, which actually\nhas a complete map\nof your body surface\nas well as some\ninformation mapped there\nabout what's going on\nin the outside world\nand how those\ncombined with what's\ngoing on in your\ninternal landscape, that\nis within your body.\nAlso a brain region called\nthe ACC or intengu--\nexcuse me, anterior cingulate\ncortex and the amygdala.\nSo a lot of\ninformation is mapped\nwithin the salience\nnetwork about how we feel\nand how we feel in relation\nto things that are happening\naround us and within us.\nAnd the salience network\nhas one main job,\nwhich is to pay\nattention to what's\nmost interesting either\nin the world or inside us\nin terms of feelings\nor experiences.\nSo we've got three networks--\nexecutive network, which\nis there to suppress\nchoices in terms of actions\nwe could take but\ndecide not to, or things\nwe could think about but\nchoose not to or try not to,\nthe default mode network,\nwhich is basically the catalog\nor library of\nprevious experiences\nthat we have available to us\nthat would act as the paints\non a palette or the\npossible ingredients\nthat could go into a recipe.\nAll of that has to, again,\narise from previous experience.\nWe can't close our\neyes and suddenly\nbe able to access all the\nmelodies that we've never\nheard before or all our ideas\nand concepts and knowledge\nabout music if we don't\nhave musical understanding\nor visual understanding.\nSo we're really\ndrawing up the library.\nAnd that library tends to\nbe rather disorganized.\nIt swirls around.\nIt's not very structured\nunless we're actively trying\nto think about something.\nAnd then we have the\nsalience network,\nwhich is the networks within\nthe brain that decide or make\nchoices about what's most\ninteresting to pay attention to\nin a given moment.\nSo those three networks work\ntogether to create things.\nAnd when I say create\nthings, we again\nhave to really\ndefinition of creativity.\nCreativity is a rearrangement\nof existing elements into novel\ncombinations that reveal\nsomething fundamental about how\nwe or the world works.\nAnd, this is very important.\nIt tends to be things\nthat are useful.\nNow, they can merely be\nuseful because they're\nentertaining or\nthrilling, they can also\nhave a particular utility\nor use in the world\nlike a piece of technology\nthat is actually\nuseful like an app\nor a smartphone\nor a computer actually\nhas utility or a vehicle.\nThere are creative acts that\nled to the formation of vehicles\nand computers, et cetera.\nBut the point is that\njust merely coming up\nwith novel combinations of\nthings like wings on a fish\ntank, that's not\ncreative or it's not\ncreative in any meaningful way\nbecause it's simply not useful.\nIt doesn't reveal anything\nfundamental new or purposeful.\nIt doesn't allow\nus to think about\nor interact with the world\nor ourselves in novel ways.\nWhereas things, people,\nactions, and ideas\nthat are truly creative\nreally change the way\nthat we are able to\naccess the world.\nThey act as portals to the\nworld and to ourselves.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greenes now called AG1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreene since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens,\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets to me\nthe probiotics that I\nneed for gut health, our\ngut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiome health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D-3 K-2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D-3 K-2.\nSo now you have some idea about\nthe brain areas and networks\ninvolved in creativity.\nBut I want to be very\nclear that any time we\ntalk about mechanisms\nand brain areas, what's\nfar more important than the\nnames of those brain areas\nis an understanding\nof what they do.\nSo if you couldn't remember\nthe anterior cingulate\ncortex or the fact that\nthe prefrontal cortex is\ninvolved in executive function,\net cetera, that's fine.\nIt's less important that\nyou know the names of things\nthan you understand the action\nsteps that those things take.\nThat is the verb actions\nthat those particular brain\nareas engage in order to arrive\nat a particular endpoint.\nAnd the endpoint we're talking\nabout today is creativity.\nI want to discuss creativity\nin terms of what actually\ngoes into being creative.\nAnd it turns out there\nare just two elements.\nAnd those two\nelements are now well\nunderstood from the\nperspective of psychology\nand fortunately, the\nneuroscience well\nsupports what the psychology\nsays and vise versa.\nAnd those two elements\nthat go into coming up\nwith a creative idea and then\nimplementing or developing\nthat creative idea\ninto something real\nthat you and the rest of\nthe world can experience\nor divergent thinking\nand convergent thinking.\nAnd divergent thinking\nand convergent thinking\nare very straightforward\nto understand.\nDivergent thinking is taking\nsome known object or event\nin the world or\nsport or concept.\nIt could be running.\nIt could be a musical note.\nIt could be jumping.\nIt could be a particular\ncolor on a piece of paper.\nAnd asking yourself how\nmany different things\ncould that thing actually be.\nAnd you might say, well,\nrunning is running.\nBut let's use divergent\nthinking as a way\nto illustrate what\ndivergent thinking is.\nIf I show you a picture\nof somebody running,\nI say, what do you.\nSee and you say I\nsee somebody running.\nAnd then I might give you\na divergent thinking task\nand these tasks\nare the same ones\nused in various experiments.\nAnd I'd say, how many\ndifferent things can you\nthink about based on\nthis picture that you\nsee of somebody running.\nNow, if you are able to\nengage divergent thinking,\nyou could say\nrunning to the store.\nRunning away from a lion.\nRunning towards somebody I love.\nOr maybe you have a more\nelaborate imagination\nand you could say,\nrunning in front of a bus\nto grab a kid so the kid\ndoesn't get hit by the bus.\nOr running toward a\nconcert because I'm\nso excited about the\nparticular concert\nand then it starts to\nspool into a story.\nIn other words,\ndivergent thinking\ninvolves taking one simple what\nwe would call a neuroscience\nor psychology stimulus, one\nimage, or sound, et cetera\nand trying to\nradiate out from that\nas many different divergent\nsituations, properties,\ncharacteristics, events, things\nfrom that one specific element.\nSo any divergent thinking task\nwould involve exactly that.\nI'd show you pictures or play\nyou sounds or words or notes\nor describe to you\nevents in history\nand try and see how many\nthings can radiate out\nfrom that in to diverse,\ndiverse, even distant types\nof concepts and pictures.\nOK.\nSo that's divergent thinking.\nDivergent thinking\nis really the process\nthat underlies idea generation.\nAnd the basis of\ndivergent thinking\nis that more than\none idea is correct.\nIn fact, the more ideas that\nyou have about one thing,\nthe better your\ndivergent thinking.\nSo if I were to give you\nthree minutes to list off\nall the things you can think\nabout related to this pen\nthat I'm holding up.\nFor those of you listening\nI'm just holding up\na pen in front of me.\nYou just write them\nout or say them out.\nOver the next 3 minutes\nthat would be an example\nof divergent thinking.\nHowever, if you just said\nblack pen, red pen, white pen,\ngreen pen, et cetera, that's\nnot very divergent thinking.\nIt's only divergent in the\ncontext of color space.\nAnd when I say space\nthat's just a nerd\nspeak for one particular\ndomain of thinking.\nWhereas if you said\nred pen, white pen,\nessay pen in a door\nto hold the door\nopen so that someone can\nreturn to a building.\nAnd you started spooling\noff a story related to that\nand why that was important,\nwell, there you go.\nDivergent thinking is\nessentially taking one element\nand coming up with\nmany, many answers.\nAnd in the context of\ndivergent thinking,\nany answer goes, but\nas we'll soon learn,\nnot every answer is\ninteresting and relevant\nthat is not every answer help\nsolve something or reveal\nsomething fundamental\nand therefore,\nnot every divergent\nanswer is truly creative.\nThe other aspect of\ndivergent thinking\nthat's really\nimportant to understand\nis that the selection criteria\nare extremely vague and vast.\nThat is, there\nare no constraints\non what you come up with.\nSo if I hold up this\npen and you say,\norangutan, that's a perfectly\nvalid divergent idea\nfrom this pen because\nyou thought of it\nand it's distantly related.\nHowever, we have to\nremember our earlier rule.\nIf black pen and orangutan are\nnot linked up in our brain,\nin the observer's brain\nin any meaningful way,\nit's only interesting\nto you because you\nare the only one\nthat understands\nthe rule that underlies the link\nbetween this pen and orangutan.\nWhereas if you come up with\nsomething different that\nsomehow tells me and\neverybody else something\ninteresting about\npens or orangutans,\nnow that's a truly\ncreative idea.\nI don't have such\nan example in mind\nbut later I'll give\nyou some examples\nof how you can actually\nMarch down the path\nof divergent thinking and\nuse that executive network\nto suppress certain\noptions to cross off\ncertain answers because, again,\nan answer is valid but not all\nvalid answers are\ninteresting or useful.\nAnd you can cross\nthose off and arrive\nat the most interesting\nand truly creative answer.\nA couple of more things\nabout divergent thinking.\nDivergent thinking largely\ntaps into the networks\nof the brain that are involved\nin mental flexibility.\nSo this is a different aspect\nof our prefrontal cortex, which\nis not based on executive\nfunction and our ability\nto reduce options but rather\nareas of the prefrontal cortex\nthat are available to\ngenerate multiple options\nand actually suppress context\nto forget that pens are just\nfor writing, for\ninstance, and that pens\ncan do other things\nlike hold a door open.\nIt's really an\nunusual use of a pen.\nAgain, none of these\nexamples that I'm giving\nare particularly interesting.\nThey're just designed to get\nyou to understand the underlying\nconcept of divergent thinking.\nAnd then the last\nthing I'd like you\nto know about divergent thinking\nis that divergent thinking\ninvolves a exploration.\nIt's a wandering through\nof ideas that you already\nhad in your library, in\nyour memory banks about pens\nand what pens\ncould be related to\nand what pens ought\nnot to be related to.\nSo, again, what's really\nimportant about creativity\nis that there has to be the\nbasic building blocks already\nexisting within us.\nThis is why it's so\nimportant to understand\nthat if you are somebody who\nreally seeks to be creative,\nyou really do need to\nbe somebody who forages\nfor information and structured\ninformation in particular\nif you are to be creative.\nThe architect\nsimply can't come up\nwith incredible drawings\nor plans for buildings\nwithout understanding how\nbuildings are put together\nin the various rules\nthat govern buildings.\nIn other words, you\ncan't break rules\nthat you don't understand.\nI think in movies,\nespecially, we\nhave this idea in mind\nof this limitless concept\nor that we have these hidden\ngeniuses that somehow have\naccess to all the math\nknowledge without ever having\ndone any formal math.\nActually I was flying\nback from Texas recently\nand Good Will Hunting\nwas on somebody's screen.\nI don't tend to watch\nmovies on the plane\nvery often, sometimes\nbut not often.\nAnd I was remembering\nin that movie,\nyou've got this math genius who\nis a janitor at MIT, et cetera\nand apparently just has\naccess to all this knowledge.\nIt's a wonderful concept.\nA very, very I would say\neven exceedingly rare thing\nto occur in the world.\nSure there are people\nwho seem to have\na natural talent for mathematics\nor for something else.\nBut this idea that\nthere are incredible\ngeniuses among us that\njust spontaneously\nhave so much knowledge, that's\nby far the exception rather\nthan the rule, of course, and\nmay not even actually exist.\nI'm sure someone will put\nit in the comments examples\nwhere this actually exists.\nMore often than\nnot, what you find\nis that people who have extreme\nvirtuosity in a given area\nput many, many years\ninto developing\nthe basic substrates,\nthe basic building blocks\nof whatever it is\ntheir craft happens\nto be where they\ndemonstrate virtuosity.\nSo this is very\nimportant to understand.\nNonetheless, divergent thinking\nis the critical element\nfor initiating the\ncreative process.\nAgain, thinking about\ncreativity as a verb.\nAnd divergent thinking involves\ntaking some starting point,\nin this case a pen,\nand then radiating out\nfrom that in a fairly\nunconstrained what biologists\ncall a random walk just\nwandering through your thought\nspace and memory\nspace about what\ncould be related to this pen.\nNow, on the flip\nside of creativity\nis the implementation of\nspecific combinations of things\nand testing those to see whether\nor not they are interesting,\nrelevant, or delight\nto us or other people\nor scare us or other people\nor thrill us or other people.\nIn other words, a testing\nof whether or not there's\nsome fundamental rule to emerge.\nAgain, I'm going to repeat\nthis many, many times\nthroughout this\nepisode and I'm not\ngoing to apologize for\nthat because I think\nit's so important to understand\nthat creativity is not just\nnovel combinations.\nThey are novel\ncombinations of things that\nreveal something fundamental.\nAnd that often pop out\nto us if not every time\ncertainly most of the time\nthat we see that thing.\nIt almost never\nseems to be the case\nthat something truly creative\ndulls in its expression.\nAnd that's because what\nit's repeating to us\nover and over again is this\nfundamental rule that normally\nwe can't see or\nhear or experience\nin the absence of\nthis creative act.\nSo the second part of creativity\nwhere things are tested\nand where truly creative\nelements are discovered\nis in convergent thinking.\nAnd convergent thinking\nis, as the name\nsuggests, just the opposite\nof divergent thinking.\nConvergent thinking\nwould be, for example,\nif I give you an image or I\ntell you the following things,\nI say wing, water, an engine.\nThe concept that I\nhappen to have in mind\nis that of a plane\nthat can land on water.\nMost planes don't\nland on water or not\nintended to land on water.\nOne would hope that\ntheir plane doesn't\nland on water unless\nit's a plane designed\nto land on water.\nBut in this case, a plane\nthat can land on water\nis one of the very few answers\nthat can combine wing, water,\nand engine.\nI'm sure there\nare other answers,\nthere are other\nconvergent thinking modes\nthat can take you to an\nanswer that would be valid.\nBut there are not many.\nAnd here what's\nreally most important\nis that I'm not asking\nyou to spool out\nor to radiate out from\nthese three things.\nRather, I'm asking you to\ncombine them in some way that\nmakes sense in the real world.\nAnd indeed there are planes\nthat can land on water.\nAnd wing water and\nengine combined\nwithin those things\nthey are fundamental\nfeatures, they are in\nfact, necessary but not\nsufficient for having a\nplane that can land on water.\nOK.\nSo that's just one example\nof convergent thinking.\nAnd a convergent\nthinking task would\ninvolve you being given\na list of two or three\nor maybe even five\ndifferent things.\nAnd then for each of\nthose two or three or five\ndifferent things,\nas quickly as you\ncan to come up with\na single answer\nthat binds all of those\nin a real world concept\nthat obey the laws of nature\nor physics in some way.\nFor instance, you can just come\nup with some answer that said,\na bird that swallowed\nan engine and that\nhappens to be a sea bird.\nYou could come up with that,\nbut that actually is not\nsomething that happens or\nis that very typical at all.\nAnd so it seems like a mishmash\nof things that are really\njust designed for you\nto try and accomplish\nan answer rather\nthan something real,\nsuch as a plane\nthat lands on water.\nOK.\nThe point here is that\ndivergent thinking\nis one aspect of our\ncognition, of our thinking.\nAnd convergent thinking\nis a very distinct aspect\nof our cognition.\nIn fact, one of the\ncritical requirements\nfor convergent thinking is\nalso to access our memory banks\nand our understanding\nabout the outside world\njust as it were with\ndivergent thinking,\nbut it requires more focus\nand more persistence.\nIn fact, if we were to\ncome up with a key rule\nfor divergent\nthinking, it would be\nyou almost want to have just\nenough focus to remember what\nthe initial object or\nthing that was mentioned\nwas to keep that in mind\nso that your answers don't\nbecome completely random.\nBut the more distant and\neverywhere in between that\nyou can generate\nanswers that is,\nthe things that are\nvery close to pens,\nblack pen, red pen\nversus pen and doorstop,\npen acting as a doorstop.\nThose are-- one is\nvery close, red pen is\nvery close to black pen,\ndoorstop is pretty far\nfrom black pen.\nSo that's the idea.\nIs that you want to explore and\nundergo a range of exploration\nof different ideas whereas\nwith convergent thinking,\nyou're really trying to\nbind these things together.\nAnd so the key element\nfor convergent thinking\nis the aspect of\npersistence and focus.\nAnd that's why convergent\nthinking in many ways\nfeels harder than\ndivergent thinking.\nIt feels like there's an answer.\nAnd I want to get the answer\nright and I can't solve it.\nIt's a puzzle and\nit's a puzzle that\nrelies on very\ndistinct brain circuits\nfrom divergent thinking.\nWhich brain circuits?\nWell, that's what we're\ngoing to describe next.\nAnd again, this\nis not just going\nto be a list of different brain\ncircuits with different names\ndoing different things,\nthat wouldn't be useful\nto you or to me.\nRather, what you're about to\nlearn is truly incredible.\nWhat it is we're going to talk\nabout one single molecule--\ndopamine, which is a\nmolecule most typically\nassociated with motivation\nand desire and drive\nand feelings of\npleasure in some cases.\nBut that actually resides\nwithin four different networks\nin the brain.\nToday we're going to talk\nabout two of those networks.\nAnd dopamine acting\nin one network\ndirectly underlies\ndivergent thinking.\nWhereas dopamine in\nanother brain network\nunderlies convergent thinking.\nAnd if at this point\nin this episode\nyou're saying OK,\nwhen am I going\nto get the tools to\nunderstand creativity\nand how to be creative,\nwhat I can assure\nyou is that if you understand\ndivergent thinking which\nhopefully now you do, and you\ncan understand what convergent\nthinking is, and\nyou can understand\nthat dopamine is responsible\nfor both divergent thinking\nand convergent thinking but\nthrough separate pathways.\nWell, then if you can understand\nhow those two separate pathways\nwork and how to engage\nthem differentially,\ntherein lie the tools that you\ncan use both to explore ideas.\nIn other words, find what it\nis that could be creative.\nAnd then systematically\ntest each of those ideas\nfor what is truly creative.\nThat is what meets the\ncriteria for something\nthat is novel and truly\nuseful and informs us\nabout something that we've never\nseen, heard, or felt before.\nLet's just take a moment to talk\nabout the incredible molecule\nthat is dopamine.\nMany people are familiar with\ndopamine from the concept\nof quote unquote\n\"dopamine hits,\" which\nis popular language describing\nthe feeling of pleasure\nthat we get from pretty\nmuch anything that we like\nor that we continue to\nengage in repeatedly.\nSo some people will talk\nabout the dopamine hit\nthat they get from\nsomebody attractive\nthat they like texting them back\nor the dopamine hit that they\nget from social media or\nthe dopamine hit that they\nget from sugar or the dopamine\nthat they get from this\nor from that.\nTo be honest, the\nconcept of dopamine hits\nis not one that I favor because\nin general, whenever people\ntalk about dopamine\nhits, typically\nthey are talking\nabout activities\nsuch as social media\nfor which dopamine\nmay be involved at some level.\nBut often it's the case\nthat the behavior associated\nwith that thing in\nthis case, social media\nis more of the compulsive\nnature rather than\nan active seeking of something\nwith positive anticipation.\nAnd that's really what\ndopamine is about at least\nin the context of one of its\nmajor functions in the brain.\nDopamine is really about\nmotivation and desire\nand movement.\nAnd it makes sense why\nmotivation, desire,\nand movement would be\nlinked up through a common,\nin this case neuromodulator\nor chemical like dopamine.\nBecause throughout\nevolution if we\nwere excited for or motivated\nto pursue something,\nwe had to move in order\nto get it, to obtain it.\nAnd in general, we\ncan frame dopamine\nunder the umbrella\nof dopamine tends\nto be involved in\nneural circuits\nin the brain that are involved\nin processes that are taking us\nbeyond the confines of our skin.\nThat is, they motivate us\nto go do something in terms\nof action in the world.\nNow, that statement might\nseem distantly placed\nfrom a discussion\nabout creativity,\nbut as we'll learn\na little bit later,\none of the most useful tools\nfor engaging creativity\nand becoming more creative is\nto think about action elements\nwithin a narrative.\nThat is, things that we\nand others can do in order\nto discover new rules\nthrough actual movement.\nThat's a little bit cryptic.\nForgive me.\nBut I promise I'll\nreturn to it later\nand I will make\nit crystal clear.\nThere are four major circuits\nin the brain that use dopamine.\nAlthough I should mention,\nthere are additional circuits\nas well.\nIn fact, your eye\neven contains neurons\nthat release\ndopamine that control\nthe sensitivity of your eye\nat different times of day\nto light, et cetera.\nThe four major\ncircuits in the brain\nthat utilize\ndopamine however, are\nused for four major purposes.\nAnd I'll describe\nwhat those are.\nFirst of all is a\nneural circuit that\nuses dopamine among other\nthings but certainly relies\non dopamine in a critical way\nto engage movement, including\neye movements.\nAnd we will return\nto eye movement\nto why they're so important\nfor understanding creativity\nand maybe even for generating\ncreativity a little bit later.\nThe name of the\ncircuit, again, is less\nimportant than what it does.\nBut the name of this circuit\nfor those that want to know\nis the so-called\nnigrostriatal pathway.\nThe substantia nigra\nis a brain area\nthat is very dark that\nprojects to an area\ncalled the dorsal striatum.\nIt contains a bunch\nof subregions.\nSo, again, for those of you that\nreally geek out on this stuff\ngreat, you can learn these names\nand retain them in your memory.\nIf you don't care about\nnames, don't worry about it,\njust discard the names.\nBut areas of the brain like\nthe caudate and putamen\nand the dorsal\nstriatum receive input\nfrom the substantia nigra.\nIn neuroanatomy, when\nwe name something,\nwe say the origin of that thing\nand where it connects through.\nSo nigrostriatal\ntells you that there\nis a connection between\nthe substantia nigra\nbecause it came\nfirst, nigrostriatal,\nand then striatal\nis where it ends up.\nSo nigrostriatal pathway is\ninvolved in generating bodily\nmovements.\nIt's involved in eye movements.\nAnd it is actually\na brain area that's\nengaged when you\nthink about movement.\nYou can just have a story\nin your mind about walking\nor a story in your mind\nabout running or story\nin your mind about driving.\nThis area is engaged.\nVery interesting brain area.\nSo that's the first circuit.\nVery important to understand.\nAnd I'll tell you\nright now, that\nis the brain circuit\nthat is engaged when\nyou undergo divergent thinking.\nNow, that itself\nshould be interesting.\nEven if you don't remember\nany of the names of the things\nI just told you, that\nyou have a brain circuit\nthat even if you just\nthink about walking it\nbecomes more active.\nAnd the dopamine is involved\nin that brain activity.\nAnd if you recall,\ndivergent thinking\ninvolves taking a concept\nas boring as a pen\nand thinking about\nother concepts that\ncould link up with that pen in\nsome way, logical or illogical.\nThe bridge could be completely\nabstract and really fantastical\nwith a bunch of different\nideas in between.\nA pen acting as a doorstop\nbecause of some situation\nwhere you need to run\ndown stairs in a fire\nand get back upstairs\nquickly to rescue\nsomebody, very divergent.\nOr as divergent as\nblack pen to red pen.\nBut what's amazing is\nthat that same circuit\nis the one that's involved\nin generating and thinking\nabout physical movement.\nThat turns out to be vitally\nimportant for tapping\ninto the creativity process.\nSo really frame that up in your\nmind or commit it to memory.\nNow, the second dopamine circuit\nassociated with creativity\nis the one associated with\nconvergent thinking, which,\nagain, is the\nthinking where there's\na specific correct answer.\nIt requires focus and\nit requires persistence.\nAnd the name of that\ncircuit, again, the name\nisn't as important\nas what it does.\nBut the name of that circuit\nis the mesocortical pathway.\nThe mesocortical pathway\nis involved in motivation\nand it has an emotional\ncomponent too.\nNow, it will become\nclear in a few minutes\nwhy that emotional\ncomponent is vital.\nBut this is a circuit\nthat originates\nin a brain structure called the\nlateral ventral tegmental area.\nAgain, a bunch of words you\ncan remember it if you want,\nlateral ventral\ntegmental area or you\ncan not worry about the name.\nAnd it connects to\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nthat area just\nbehind the forehead.\nAnd this mesocortical\narea is involved\nin motivation and emotion\nand is critical for focus\nand persistence.\nIt is distinct from\na very nearby area,\njust sitting right next door\nthe so-called mesolimbic area,\nwhich is involved in desire\nand feelings of reward.\nAnd this is the area that\nis associated more typically\nwith addictive behaviors\nor compulsive behaviors.\nWe're going to leave\nout the discussion\nabout the mesolimbic\npathway for now\nbecause it's not critical\nto divergent or convergent\nthinking and it's not critical\nto the process of creativity\nat least as far as we know.\nBut I mention it because it\nis the third and the four\ndopaminergic circuits.\nAnd then the fourth\ncircuit certainly\none I've never talked about\nbefore on this podcast, which\ndoesn't mean anything\nexcept that we\nhaven't gotten to it yet,\nis that tuberoinfundibular\npathway.\nAnd that is the\npathway associated\nwith dopamine and\nyour pituitary gland\nand the release of\nhormones, in particular\nthat travel to the ovary.\nIf you have ovaries\nor to your testes\nif you have testes and\ntrigger the release of things\nlike estrogen and\ntestosterone, et cetera.\nDopamine is intimately\ninvolved in that circuitry.\nAgain, not the topic\nof today's discussion.\nFor today's discussion,\nwe want to remember\nthat there's a\ndopamine circuit called\nthe nigrostriatal circuit,\nwhich is involved in movement\nand divergent thinking.\nAnd that alone should set\na flag up for you like wow,\njust thinking about\nnew ideas has something\nto do with physical movement.\nAnd the dopamine circuit that is\nthe mesocortical pathway, which\nis the one that's associated\nwith motivation and emotion,\nand that's the one required\nfor persistence and focus\nfor convergent thinking.\nWhy am I telling you all\nof this about dopamine?\nWell, it turns out that dopamine\ncreates a certain number\nof responses in the brain and\nbody when it is active in one\nor the other of these circuits.\nAnd just for sake\nof simplicity, so\nI don't have to keep saying\nnigrostriatal and mesocortical.\nHere going forward,\nI'm going to talk\nabout the dopamine\ncircuit that's\nassociated with\ndivergent thinking\nor the dopamine\ncircuit associated\nwith convergent thinking.\nAnd, again, divergent\nthinking and convergent\nthink are the two processes\nthat have to occur.\nUsually first divergent then\nconvergent thinking then\nback and forth\nand back and forth\nin order to arrive at\nsomething creative.\nDivergent thinking\nis about exploration.\nConvergent thinking is about\ntesting things and coming up\nwith things that are the\nright answer that feel right.\nAnd we will better define what\nright means a little bit later.\nBut you already know\nright in this context\nis when you have some\ncombination of elements\nor some idea or\nsome written passage\nor some music or\nsome physical action\nthat you just know this is\nreally novel and really cool.\nOr people see it or\nhear it or taste it\nand say, this is really\nnovel and really cool\nand they don't\nnecessarily know why.\nIt's just different in\na way that feels true.\nI'd like to take a brief\nbreak and thank our sponsor\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a\nbeliever in getting\nregular blood work done.\nFor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a lot\nof blood and DNA tests\nout there however,\nis that you get data\nback about metabolic factors,\nlipids, and hormones,\nand so forth.\nBut you don't know what\nto do with those data.\nInsideTracker\nsolves that problem.\nAnd makes it very easy for you\nto understand what nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation based\ninterventions you might\nwant to take on in order\nto adjust the numbers of\nthose metabolic factors,\nhormones, lipids,\nand other things that\nimpact your immediate and\nlong-term health to bring\nthose numbers into

definition\nand mechanism that\nleaves you in a place\nof real wanting a tool.\nAnd so I promise that I'm\ngoing to get into more tools,\nbut to satisfy you and to\nmake sure that you do indeed\nunderstand that\nthere are tools that\ncan emerge from the information\nthat you already now\nhave in mind.\nI do want to share with\nyou one particular tool\nfrom the literature that\nhas been demonstrated over\nand over again to support\nand build and enhance\ndivergent thinking.\nAnd I also want\nto share with you\na tool that has been shown\nfrom the scientific literature\nto enhance convergent thinking\nbecause both convergent and\ndivergent thinking are critical\nfor the creative process.\nNow, I should emphasize\nthat some people out there\neither by training or\nby genetics or by both\nwill be naturally better\nat divergent or convergent\nthinking.\nAnd in fact, we now know\nin almost poetic way\nthat naturally\noccurring variations\nin genes which underlie\nnaturally occurring variations\nin the percentage of\ndopamine in one set of brain\ncircuits versus another do,\nseem to relate to whether or not\npeople are naturally good\nat divergent thinking\nor convergent thinking.\nNow, that's a very\nnature based explanation\nfor why some people are\nbetter at divergent thinking\nand other people are better\nat convergent thinking.\nNature and nurture is\nsomething that can never really\nbe teased apart exactly because,\nof course, if someone has\na natural proclivity for\nsomething based on their genes,\nyou can't often separate\nthat from their parents\nbecause we inherit our\ngenes from our parents\nalthough even in cases\nwhere people are raised away\nfrom their parents through\nadoption, et cetera.\nIt's very hard to separate\nnature and nurture\nbecause somebody with a\nnatural proclivity for things\nmight engage in those things\nmore, et cetera, et cetera.\nThe point is that\nfor those of you that\nare very, very good\nat divergent thinking\nor very, very good at convergent\nthinking, some of that\nmight have been inherited.\nBut more than likely some of\nthat depended on the activities\nthat you engaged in\nin your early years,\nin particular in the years\nbetween age 5 and 25.\nAnd for those of you that\nare aged between 5 and 25,\nall I can say is\nplease learn to engage\nboth divergent and convergent\nthinking as much as\npossible because you will\nenhance your ability for both.\nFor those of you\n25 and older, you\ncan still enhance\nyour ability to engage\ndivergent and\nconvergent thinking.\nAnd the fortunate news,\nthe equalizer I should say\nis that regardless\nof whether or not\nyou're a naturally better\nat divergent or convergent\nthinking or you acquired\nit through activities,\nyou need both in\norder to be creative.\nSo what we know is that in order\nto engage divergent thinking,\nwe need access to\nour memory banks.\nWe need to come up\nwith possibilities.\nAnd those possibilities\ncan only come\nfrom what's contained within\nour memory systems of our brain.\nAreas like the\nhippocampus, et cetera.\nBut the names\nagain don't matter.\nWe just know that\nif we are going\nto come up with novel\ncombinations of things or novel\nuses of things or totally\nnew ideas about how\nobjects or notes of\nmusic or foods or tastes\nor whatever can be\ncombined, we have\nto do that with\npre-existing knowledge.\nAnd yet what we\nneed to do in order\nto engage divergent\nthinking is suppress\nwhat is called\nautobiographical narratives\nand in particular,\nautobiographical narratives.\nWe need to discard\nwith judgments\nabout how certain\ncombinations of things\nimpacted us in the past.\nThis here I think\nis what people mean\nwhen they encourage the\nexploration of creativity\nby so-called\nboundary exploration.\nYou hear about this a\nlot in the self-help,\nin psychology literature.\nAnd I'm not at all\ndisparaging of that literature\nalthough rarely does it define\nexactly how and why to go\nabout being more\ncreative or in this case\nto be more divergent\nin our thinking.\nSo they'll say, you\nhave to take risks\nor you have to\nsuppress judgment.\nBut how do you actually do that?\nWell, there's a wonderful\npaper that talks about one way\nto do it.\nOne way to do it is what's\ncalled open monitoring\nmeditation or even just\nopen monitoring thinking.\nAnd just to make\nwhat could otherwise\nbe a somewhat complex\nsection here very simple.\nWhat I'll also tell\nyou is that if you\nwant to enhance\nconvergent thinking,\nyou can do that\na number of ways,\nbut you can do that\nin particular by doing\na different type of meditation\nor thought process, which\nis called focused\nattention meditation.\nSo let's talk about open\nmonitoring meditation\nand why it's so\nuseful for enhancing\ndivergent thinking,\nthis critical element\nof the creative process.\nFirst of all, open\nmonitoring meditation\nand focused attention\nmeditation can be performed\nthe exact same way physically.\nYou can sit there,\neyes closed, I\ndon't care if you're\nin a Lotus position,\nit doesn't really matter, you're\nlying down, you're standing up.\nYou could in theory do open\nmonitoring meditation with eyes\nopen and that would be an\ninteresting variant on it.\nBut for sake of the\ndiscussion right\nnow, let's just\nfocus on the study\nthat talks about these\nspecific tools and the way\nthat they were\nused in the study.\nThe title of the paper that\nI'm essentially summarizing\nis called open monitoring\nmeditation reduces\nthe involvement of brain regions\nrelated to memory function.\nNow, right off the\nbat that will cue you\nto something interesting.\nSomething about divergent\nthinking and open monitoring\nis related to\nsuppressing memory.\nBut as you recall,\njust a few moments ago,\nI said that in order to\nengage in divergent thinking,\nyou need to kill off\nthe narratives of what\nhas to be related to what and\ncome up with new narratives.\nYou still need to\nunderstand possibilities\nbut you need to forget\nprior understanding of what\nthose possibilities have to be\nand start thinking about what\nthose possibilities could be.\nAnd so that it turns\nout involves suppression\nof certain brain areas.\nOpen monitoring\nmeditation is typically\ndone for about 10 to 30 minutes\nalthough it could be longer.\nAnd unlike other\nforms of meditation\nwhere you sit and\nconcentrate on your breathing\nand trying to redirect your\nthinking back to your breathing\nor to your posture or\nto a chant or a mantra,\nopen monitoring\nmeditation is simply\na matter of having sit there\nor lie down and close your eyes\nand to allow whatever surfaces\nin your mind to surface.\nAnd what you practice is\nthe practice of nonjudgment.\nNow, nonjudgment itself is a\nlittle bit of an abstract theme\nbecause, of course, the\nmoment you say don't judge you\nand others start to judge.\nIt's just the way\nthat the brain works.\nYou say, don't think\nabout an elephant\nyou think about an elephant.\nThat's a perfectly natural.\nYou go to an edge of a bridge\nor a cliff and you think about\njumping off even\nthough you don't.\nPlease don't jump off.\nAnd that's because it's\npart of the circuitry that's\nkeeping you from jumping off.\nIs the thought about what\nwould happen if you did.\nOK?\nSo open monitoring\nmeditation involves\ndedicating a certain amount of\ntime where you close your eyes\nand whatever thoughts arise,\nwhatever emotions arise,\nwhatever ideas arise\nto watch those and take\nan inventory of them to just\nmerely watch them show up\nand pass or maybe become fixated\non them for some period of time\nor maybe even just one\nfor a long period of time.\nAll of that is fine.\nIn other words, whatever\nsurfaces surfaces.\nThat's open\nmonitoring meditation.\nAnd that we know from\nbrain imaging studies\nand we know from\nmeasurements of dopamine,\nin particular brain circuits and\nwe know from people who train\nwith open monitoring\nmeditation on a regular basis\nimproves divergent\nthinking capability.\nSo in terms of tools, practicing\nopen monitoring meditation\nor what I would just call\nopen monitoring thinking\nis going to be immensely useful.\nAnd this is actually\nan opportunity\nto queue up something that\nI mentioned in our episode\non meditation, which goes deep\ninto the different meditation\ninvolving focus inward\nand outward, et cetera.\nYou're welcome to\ncheck out that episode.\nIt's at hubermanlab.com.\nBut the point is that rather\nthan think about the word\nmeditation, which carries a\nbunch of ideas about what it is\nand what it isn't\nand how to do it,\nmeditation is really just\na perceptual exercise.\nFor instance, you\ncould do a meditation\nwhere you look at a single\npoint on a wall for five minutes\nand redirect your focus to that\nsingle point on a wall over\nand over again\nevery time your mind\ndrifts as it no doubt would.\nOr to a tone in the room.\nYou could attend to that\nand redirect to that.\nRather than think about\nit as a meditation,\nit's really just a\nperceptual exercise.\nThat's all that meditation is.\nSo open monitoring\nmeditation is really\njust a form of perception\nwhere you're paying attention,\nyou're perceiving your thoughts\nwithout laying judgment\nto those thoughts or\ntrying not to lay judgment\nto those thoughts.\nAnd what people\nfind is that they\nvery quickly within\na few days get better\nat doing open\nmonitoring meditation.\nAnd fortunately,\nwithin just a few days\nand certainly within about a\nweek or more of practice and it\ndoesn't even have to\nbe daily practice.\nSo although, of\ncourse, daily practice\nwill accelerate the\nprocess further,\npeople become significantly\nbetter at divergent thinking.\nAnd that's because of\nthe dopamine circuits\nand in particular, along\nthe nigrostriatal pathway\nbecoming more active.\nAnd the wonderful\nthing is that when\nyou repeat a practice and\na particular neural circuit\nis engaged over and\nover again deliberately,\nthat neural circuit\nbecomes easier to engage.\nSo-called neuroplasticity.\nSo I would encourage\nany of you that\nwant to explore the creative\nprocess for whatever reason\nor get better the\ncreative process,\ndedicate some amount of time.\nMaybe even just five\nminutes every other day\nto doing this open\nmonitoring meditation.\nI've tried this meditation.\nIt's actually quite fun to\ndo because at least to me\nit feels a lot easier than\nthe meditation associated\nwith convergent thinking.\nNow, the convergent\nthinking meditation\nis the so-called focus\nattention meditation.\nAnd that's also described\nin the same study.\nAnd other studies have\nexplored which particular brain\nnetworks it involves.\nAnd I can just tell\nyou that focused\nattention meditation,\nwhich you can think of\nor I'd prefer that you think of\njust as a perceptual exercise\ninvolves sitting or lying\ndown, closing your eyes,\nfocusing either on your breath,\nor some element of your body.\nCould be the tops of your knees\nor the clasp of your hands.\nIt could be focusing\non an auditory tone,\nyou could even do it eyes open\nand stare at a point on a wall\nor a flame of light.\nWhatever it happens\nto be that allows\nyou to redirect your focus to\na particular location or idea\nor sound.\nThat is known to\nimprove your ability\nto engage convergent\nthinking, to quickly\nparse through or analyze a\nbunch of different choices,\nand to persist in\nchoice selection\nand therefore more rapidly\narrive at the correct answer.\nThis is well-established\nand, in fact, in, the episode\nI did with a wonderful\nguest Dr. Wendy Suzuki\nfrom New York\nUniversity she talked\nabout how a daily meditation\nof about 10 to 13 minutes\nperformed for about eight weeks.\nThat's what they explore.\nAnd that study greatly\nincreases people's ability\nto focus and in\nfact, their memory.\nAnd that's exactly\nthe point, which\nis that convergent thinking as\nI mentioned before, it requires\npersistence, focus, and\naccess to specific memories.\nSo if you are somebody who\nwants to get better at focusing,\nthat is the meditation for you.\nHowever, because today we're\ntalking about creativity,\nif you are somebody\nwho wants to get better\nat divergent thinking\nand convergent thinking,\nthe two elements of creativity.\nThat is, I would encourage\nyou to do a dual meditation.\nThat is, a meditation\nthat starts\nwith open monitoring for\nmaybe 5 to 10 minutes\nand then transitions to\nfocused attention for maybe\n5 to 10 minutes.\nBecause the positioning\nof divergent thinking\nand then convergent thinking\nclose together, more closely\nresembles what the\ncreative process really is\nand what it typically involves.\nMost of us would love to\nhave a situation where\nwe can spend a morning or a\nday or a week brainstorming.\nJust brainstorming.\nWhatever we think about is fine.\nThat's divergent thinking.\nWhatever elements just throw\nthem up on the whiteboard.\nWe sometimes see\npeople and companies\ndoing this at retreats.\nYou bring people into\na novel environment.\nYou say, let's just\nforget all the rules\nand let's just come up with\nnew ideas about something.\nNew uses of something,\nnew strategies.\nAnd nothing is too crazy.\nNothing is off limits.\nAnd sure, that's\na useful exercise\nso-called brainstorming.\nBut at some point,\nthere's the requirement\nto cross off things.\nAnd typically that's\ndone later in the retreat\nor later in the meeting\nor later in the weekend.\nAnd that's a wonderful\nway to approach creativity\nand to try and be creative.\nBut not a lot of people train\nfor that on a regular basis.\nSo what I just\ndescribed to you are\nresearch tested\ntools for training\nfor divergent thinking\nand convergent thinking.\nAnd I would encourage\npeople who are\ninterested in being more\ncreative to try and do these\non a somewhat regular basis.\nIf not every day then certainly\na few times a week or more.\nCertainly the more\nyou do it, the better\nyou're going to get it.\nThat's well demonstrated\nin the literature.\nAnd if you're somebody\nwho's very consistent doing\nmaybe five minutes of open\nmonitoring meditation and five\nminutes immediately\nafter of focus attention\nmeditation daily, you\ncan expect that you\nwill get very, very good\nat these processes very,\nvery quickly.\nNow, I'm not going to go\ninto a lengthy description\nof the different lines of\nevidence that the corresponding\nareas of the brain are active\nin each of these different .\nMeditation but\nwhat I can tell you\nis that there have been\nsome beautiful what\nare called loss of\nfunction studies\nwhere particular brain areas\nare either depleted of dopamine\nor where dopamine\nin some cases I\nguess what we would call\ngain of function studies\nalthough not the gain\nof function studies\nassociated with virology\ndifferent gain of function\nstudies where you enhance the\nlevel of dopamine in the brain.\nWhat you find is that both\ndivergent and convergent\nthinking are enhanced\nwhen levels of dopamine\nare elevated.\nNow, we're not necessarily\ntalking about pharmacology\nhere.\nIt turns out that\nthere are other ways\nto elevate dopamine\nthat make us better\nat divergent and convergent\nthinking in particular,\nby using mood.\nAnd now I'd like to\ntalk about what mood you\nare in when you happen to\nstart a creative process,\nor try and do a training such\nas open monitoring meditation\nor focused meditation.\nHow your mood relates to your\nlevel of dopamine at baseline.\nWhat we call your\ntonic as it's called,\nmeaning consistent or\nongoing level of dopamine,\nhow that dictates whether or\nnot you are going to be better\nat one particular aspect of\nthe creative process or another\nand how you can enhance\nyour creativity in the very\nshort term, very quickly using\ntools that are known to trigger\nadditional release of dopamine,\nwhich in some cases is good\nand in some cases is\nbad, I should mention.\nAnd in other words,\ndetermine how\nyou feel in one\nmoment should dictate\nwhat tool you should use in\norder to become more creative.\nThe relationship between\nmood and creativity\nis a fascinating\none that is bridged\nby one main feature, which is\nthe amount of dopamine present\nin this nigrostriatal pathway.\nAnd there's a really\nwonderful correlate\nor measure of the\namount of dopamine\nthat's active in\nthat pathway that\ncan be addressed noninvasively\nin the laboratory.\nAs I mentioned, the\nnigrostriatal pathway\nis involved in movement\nand in eye blinking which,\nof course, is a movement.\nIt's not a movement of\nthe sort that we typically\nthink of when we\nthink of movements,\nbut nonetheless it\nrelies on dopamine levels\nin this pathway.\nAnd in fact, we can\nstate very confidently\nthat when dopamine\nlevels are elevated,\nthe blinking reflex\nis more active.\nPeople just blink more.\nWhen dopamine levels are lower\nor less active in this pathway,\npeople tend to blink less.\nSo blink frequency\nis a common measure\nin studies of dopamine\nwithin this pathway that\nrelate to creativity.\nThe work that I'm\nabout to describe\nis largely the\nwork of two authors\nwho have done wonderful\nwork across several papers.\nUnfortunately,\nfor me their names\nare difficult to pronounce.\nSo I apologize to them\nand their relatives\nfor what is sure to be\nincorrect pronunciation.\nBut the last names\nof these authors\nare Chermahini and Hommel.\nThey're in the Netherlands.\nSo Chermahini and Hommel done\na number of different papers\nor studies rather\nof the relationship\nbetween blinking,\nmood, and creativity\nin particular,\ndivergent thinking.\nWhat they found is that\nif people are blinking\nfairly often and they\nmeasure their mood\nthrough subjective\ntests and if they\nwere to do brain imaging,\nwhich other studies have done,\nthey find is that\nthose people can\nengage in divergent\nthinking very easily.\nIn other words,\nbeing in a good mood\nfacilitates divergent thinking.\nNow, some of you might\nimmediately say, well, duh,\nif you're in a good\nmood you can be\nmore playful about the\nexploration about what\ncould happen with\nthese notes of music\nor these foods, et cetera.\nBut it's not so obvious.\nBecause it turns out that if\nyour dopamine levels are very,\nvery high, and this can\nbe measured noninvasively\nthrough the frequency\nof blinks or it\ncan be measured more invasively\nthrough brain imaging\neven through blood\ndraws or other methods\nto measure dopamine.\nIf dopamine levels are very,\nvery high, what you observe\nis that divergent thinking\nis actually very, very poor.\nNow, a naturally occurring\ntruly pathological example,\nthis would be something\nlike manic bipolar disorder\nwhere somebody is in the\nmanic phase or somebody who\nhas taken methamphetamine or\ncocaine, what tends to happen\nis that they have lots and lots\nof ideas, all of those ideas\nseem really exciting to them.\nBut if you were to talk to\nthem for any given moment,\nthey would be very fixated on\none particular tunnel of ideas.\nAnd by being fixated on one\nparticular tunnel of ideas\nlike the idea that they're going\nto run for president tomorrow,\nthis is unfortunately\ntypical of people\nwho have bipolar, which is\nnot to say that everybody who\nruns for president is bipolar\nrather people who are bipolar\noften have these\ndelusions of grandeur\nthat they're somehow going\nto be president simply\nbecause they decided to and that\nthey were selected to do this,\net cetera, et cetera.\nIdeas about themselves\nand other people\nthat are very constrained.\nIn other words,\nnot very divergent.\nSo divergent thinking is favored\nby having elevated levels\nof dopamine but not too high.\nWell, that, of course,\ncreates a conundrum.\nHow do you know how\nmuch dopamine you need\nand how to achieve those\nelevated levels of dopamine.\nWell, leaving aside\npeople who are suffering\nfrom a manic episode what\nChermahini and Hommel have\ndiscovered is that if\npeople are in a low mood,\nthey're not feeling great,\nmaybe they're depressed\nbut they're just not\nfeeling that great.\nThey feel on a scale of 1 to 10,\naround a 2, or a 3, maybe a 4.\nThe probability\nthat they will be\nable to engage effectively\nin divergent thinking\nis quite low.\nHowever, the good news\nis, they are typically\nvery susceptible to\nelevations in mood\nthrough observing or\nhearing positive stories,\nlistening to music\nthat they like,\nany kind of so-called\ninspirational stimuli.\nNow, this is good news.\nWhat this means\nis that if you're\nsomebody who's not feeling\nvery motivated to engage\nin divergent thinking, you're\nnot feeling very creative,\nyou're feeling a little low.\nThe thing to do in\nthat case is actually\nto take external stimuli.\nThings that you like and start\ninteracting with those stimuli\nto get your mood elevated\nand then to engage\nin divergent thinking.\nHowever, what Chermahini\nand Hommel have also shown\nis that if people are\nalready in a very good mood,\nelevating dopamine\nfurther is not conducive.\nAnd in fact, is detrimental\nto divergent thinking.\nAnd in that case, they would\nbe better off for example,\nnot engaging in any\nactivities or taking anything\nin the way of pharmacology\nthat would further\nincrease their dopamine.\nAnd probably limiting the\namount of external stimuli\nthat are coming in through\nmusic and visual stimuli\nand really focusing\non divergent thinking\nand the creative\nprocess immediately.\nNow, this is important.\nIn an earlier episode\nboth on bipolar\nand on other forms\nof depression,\nI talked about how rates\nof bipolar manic episodes\nand dopamine levels\nand creativity\ntend to be correlated.\nNow, unfortunately, rates of\nsuicide are 20 to 30 times\nhigher in people who have\nbipolar disorder as well.\nAnd so there's a whole dark\nside to the bipolar disorder\nthat makes it a very, very\ndangerous and important\ndisorder to treat.\nBut for sake of the\ndiscussion of creativity,\nwhat this means is\nthat we all need\nto develop some\nintuitive sense as to\nwhether or not our mood is--\nsuppose we could spin this into\nthree categories is kind of--\nyes, happy, excited, positive\nmood, and, of course,\nthere are going to\nbe levels to that.\nLow like, mmmh, or\nmeh in the middle.\nSo if you're in a\nlow mood or meh mood,\nby all means engage\nin something probably\nfor about 5 to 30\nminutes that elevates\nyour mood before trying to\nengage in divergent thinking.\nHowever, if you happen to be\nin a pretty positive mood,\neven if you're not 10\nout of 10 on mood, then\nbringing in additional\nstimuli to increase\nyour levels of dopamine\nwill not help you\nand in fact can hurt the\ndivergent thinking process.\nSo in that case, I\nwould also encourage\nyou to think about\nsomething that\nwas discussed on a\nprevious episode, which\nis the particular\neffects of caffeine.\nI'll get into caffeine\na little bit later.\nBut just very briefly,\ncaffeine increases\nlevels of dopamine receptors.\nSo it's not the caffeine is bad.\nIn fact, caffeine can\nbe neuroprotective,\nit can enhance\nfocus and so forth.\nBut divergent thinking\nis anti focus.\nIt requires just\nenough focus to be\nable to come up with new ideas.\nBut you actually don't\nwant to be overly focused.\nFocus is more conducive\nto convergent thinking.\nIn fact, that's exactly\nwhat the literature\nshows, is that caffeine because\nits effects on epinephrine\nand related systems in\nthe brain like adenosine.\nBut mainly because\nof its effects\non persistence and\nfocus is very conducive\nto convergent thinking.\nSo if you're somebody who\nwants to explore creativity\nand wants to get\nbetter at creativity,\nyou now know that\nyou need to engage\nin divergent thinking and then\nafterwards convergent thinking.\nI would recommend not using\nstimulants such as caffeine\nprior to divergent thinking\nbut rather use stimulants\nif you do want to use\nstimulants such as caffeine\nprior to convergent thinking.\nAnd in fact, in formulating\nthe architecture\nof today's episode,\nwhich took me\nmany hours across many\ndifferent days I confess,\nI actually decided to try this.\nIn trying to imagine the\ndifferent configurations\nand ways that this\ninformation can be organized,\nI deliberately\nabstained from caffeine\nduring those bouts of work.\nAnd when structuring\neverything according\nto the decisions I\nhad already made,\nI purposely ingested\ncaffeine prior to that.\nNow, of course, constructing\na podcast episode\nis not really the ultimate\nexample of a creative act\nbecause, of course, it's\ntaking existing information.\nIt's arranging in a novel ways.\nBut it doesn't necessarily\nallow key concepts\nto pop out in the way\nthat, for instance,\nBanksy or a Rothko or\nan Escher would pop out.\nI'm certainly not naive\nin thinking that it does.\nBut the principle of is\nwhat's important here.\nYou need divergent thinking.\nYou need convergent thinking.\nYou need some level\nof elevated dopamine\nin order to engage in\ndivergent thinking.\nBut not so high that it starts\nto inhibit that process.\nNow, if you were to come\ninto the laboratory,\nthis could be measured by\nyour frequency of blinking.\nFor better or for\nworse, we can't actually\ncount the number of times that\nwe blink unless we're actively\npaying attention to it.\nSo I don't recommend that you\npay attention to your blinking\nbecause that will take\nyou off course from all\nthe other important\nthings of your life.\nAnd how many times\nyou're blinking\nis rarely an important thing\nfor you to pay attention to.\nYou can however, learn to\ncalibrate your mood that is,\nto assess your mood whether\nor not you're in low, medium,\nor high mood.\nNo problem using\nthat broad binning.\nYou could scale it on 1 to 10.\nAnd then decide\nwhether or not you're\ngoing to use some\ndopamine elevating\nstimulus from the outside.\nAgain, could be music, could be\nexercise, is an excellent way\nto elevate dopamine.\nI'll talk about another\nwell-established one\nfrom the research\nliterature that\nis known to elevate dopamine by\n65% in the particular pathway\nthat's relevant for\ndivergent thinking\nand to do that without\nany pharmacology.\nI'll share that with\nyou in a moment.\nBut you need to decide\nfor you in a given moment\nor in a given work attempt\nat creativity what you need\nand apply accordingly.\nBecause as Chermahini and Hommel\nhave shown, whether or not\nyou are in a low mood,\nmedium mood, or high mood,\nreally can determine\nwhether or not\nyou'll be able to access\ndivergent thinking or not.\nNow, if you're somebody who\nalready has an idea in mind,\nyou're very excited\nabout a creative idea\nand you want to hone it,\nyou want to shape it,\nyou want to pressure test it.\nWe'll talk a little\nbit more about what\nthat means in a three step\nprocess in just a little bit.\nI would strongly\nencourage you to look\nat that process is a very\nlinear process in which there\nare right and wrong answers.\nAnd there, the use of caffeine\nat appropriate dosages\nand dosages for\ncaffeine that are safe\nand in fact,\nperformance enhancing\nwere covered in the\nepisode on caffeine turns\nout it's 1 to 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of body weight,\nby the way.\nAnd if you want to\nleverage caffeine or maybe\neven other forms of\nhealthy legal stimulants,\nthose are covered in\nthe caffeine episode.\nAnd I'll talk about a few\nmore a little bit later.\nSo to summarize this\nsegment and also\njust to make a\nmore general point,\nI think it's very\nuseful for people\nto start to pay attention to\nwhat their tonic level, that\nis their baseline\nlevel of dopamine\nought to be in this\nnigrostriatal circuit\nand in other circuits.\nAnd to do that by learning\nto assess one's mood\nand pay attention to what\nmood they happen to be in.\nAnd then to leverage tools.\nBehavioral tools, maybe\npharmacologic tools\nprovided they're safe\nand they're legal\nin order to either\nincrease dopamine\nor to elect not to\nincrease dopamine in order\nto access the creative process.\nNow, I've mentioned\npharmacology a few times.\nAnd I'd like to talk about\nthat just a little bit more\nin the context of dopamine.\nFirst of all, there is\nno supplement or drug\nthat you or anyone else can\ntake that will selectively\nelevate dopamine in only\none of the four circuits\nthat I described before.\nThis is just the state of\nthe technology nowadays.\nIf you take a pill\nor even if you\nwere to inject some\nsubstance, again, I\nhope this would be legal\nand safe, et cetera.\nWhatever mode of delivery,\nthere is no technology\nthat exists at this time that\nwould allow you to selectively\namplify dopamine.\nFor instance, just in the\nnigrostriatal pathway or just\nin the means of\nmesocortical pathway.\nAgain, the nigrostriatal\npathway associated\nwith diversion thinking, the\nmusic mesocortical pathway\nassociated with cognitive\npersistence and convergent\nthinking.\nIf you were to amplify\ndopamine levels, for instance,\nby taking the amino\nacid precursor\nto dopamine\nL-Tyrosine, something\nthat I occasionally\ndo to enhance\ndopamine levels for\nsake of work or energy,\n500 milligrams or 1,000\nmilligrams even of L-Tyrosine.\nSometimes I'll combine that with\nother things like Alpha-GPC.\nIt's going to enhance\ndopamine transmission\nin the nigrostriatal pathway,\nthe mesocortical pathway,\nbut also in the\nmesolimbic pathway,\nand also, for that matter in\nthe tuberoinfundibular pathway\nassociated with the pituitary.\nThere is no way to direct\ndopamine activation\nto just one of those pathways.\nThat's just a reflection\nof the existing technology.\nNow, this is also true if\nyou rely on illicit drugs\nto increase dopamine.\nSo if it's cocaine\nor methamphetamine,\nthose will greatly increase\ndopamine but nonselectively\nacross all those\ndifferent pathways.\nAnd likewise with any drugs that\ninhibit or block or antagonize\nas it's called dopamine.\nThis is why people who, for\ninstance, have schizophrenia\nand take drugs to suppress\nauditory hallucinations, some\nof those drugs work because they\nblock the so-called D2 receptor\nof the dopamine pathway.\nD2 receptors are\npresent in all four\nof the dopaminergic\npathways in the brain.\nAnd oftentimes, those\ndrugs will in fact\nsuppress psychotic symptoms,\nauditory hallucinations,\net cetera, because\nthey reduce dopamine.\nBut those people oftentimes will\nhave problems with movement.\nThey will express what's called\nin the clinical literature\ntardive dyskinesia.\nWrithing of the\nface and the body\nfrom suppression\nof dopamine within\nthe nigrostriatal pathway, which\nis associated with movement.\nThey will sometimes have\ndeficits in eye blinking.\nPeople with Parkinson's\nwho actually\nhave selective deficits of\ndopamine within the substantia\nnigra.\nNigrostriatal, remember,\nit's substantia nigra\nshow deficits in what?\nIn movement.\nIn the smoothness of movement.\nOftentimes they\nwon't blink at all.\nThey'll have a blank stare.\nAnd they have other\nissues as well.\nSo if you're somebody who\nis interested in increasing\ndopamine through the use\nof legal safe pharmacology\nas I would hope it\nwould be the case,\nthere are ways to\ndo that, reasonably\nsafely for most people.\nAgain, people with\nbipolar disorder issues,\nwith the dopaminergic\npathway should not do this.\nI know nowadays there's\na lot of use of drugs\nthat increase dopamine such as\nRitalin, Adderall, modafinil,\narmodafinil, often prescribed\nfor things like attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder.\nWe did an entire episode\non ADHD and pharmacologic,\nprescription, supplement, and\nbehavioral, nutritional tools\nfor ADHD.\nYou can find that episode\nat hubermanlab.com.\nI know a number of people\ntake those compounds in order\nto increase dopamine and\nfocus for sake of studying\nor other activities staying\nup long hours, et cetera.\nAnd the fact that\nthey increase focus,\nthey are effective although\nthey do have their side effects.\nSometimes severe, sometimes\nhabit forming, sometimes\neven addicting as well.\nBut the fact that\nthey increase focus\nshould automatically\ntell you something\nthat those drugs in\nparticular increase\ndopamine in the\nso-called mesocortical\nand mesolimbic pathways.\nWhy can I say that?\nHow can I say that with\nany degree of confidence?\nWell, there are these four\npathways ones involved\nin movement, but\nthese other ones\nare involved in motivation\nand desire and reward.\nAnd I told you that\nthese things can\nbe habit forming and\naddicting in some cases\nand they are can\ngreatly increase focus.\nAnd focus is supported by\nenhanced levels of dopamine\nwithin this mesolimbic\nand mesocortical pathway.\nSo yes, those drugs increase\ndopamine across the board,\nbut there does seem to be\nsome weighting of dopamine\ntoward the systems involved\nin motivation and reward\nand sometimes even leading to\nhabit formation and addiction.\nThat's why those\ndrugs should only\nbe taken with the close\nsupervision of a very\nskilled psychiatrist or somebody\nelse who's board certified\nwho can really govern that.\nThere are however, ways\nto increase dopamine\nmore evenly across the\nboard using nonprescription\napproaches.\nAnd one I already\nmentioned, which\nis L-Tyrosine taken\ntypically in dosages\nof 500 to 1,000 milligrams.\nL-Tyrosine is not as potent\nin increasing dopamine\nas are the prescription drugs\nthat I referred to before.\nTends to be milder.\nFor some people it can have\na very amplified effect.\nThey feel it right away.\nIt's very intense in\nelevating focus and motivation\nand the desire to move.\nFor other people,\nit's less potent.\nIt really depends on\na number of things.\nI should mention that regular\nconsumption of caffeine\nof 1 to 3 milligrams per\nkilogram of body weight per day\nalso will increase dopamine\nreceptor efficacy and density,\nwhich will make any existing\ndopamine more effective\nwhether or not that dopamine\nis triggered by things\nlike L-Tyrosine, or if\nyou're not taking anything\nto elevate dopamine.\nThe dopamine that\nyou do make will\nbe more effective in elevating\nyour mood, motivation,\nand desire to move.\nAnd by extension\ndivergent thinking.\nIf you are consuming\ncaffeine, but, again, caffeine\nshould be taken prior to\nconvergent thinking type task\nprobably more than it\nshould be taken prior\nto divergent thinking task.\nAnd, of course, there are\nother legal supplements\nthat can elevate\ndopamine as well\nand particular phenethylamine\nis very effective in doing that.\n600 milligrams of that\nhas a brief effect lasting\nonly about 30 to 45 minutes.\nBut it is one that\nmany people find\nbeneficial for sake of studying\nor for creative thinking\nand so on and so forth.\nNow, that's pharmacology.\nAnd in fact, there's\nan extensive landscape\nof prescription and\nsupplement based pharmacology\nand indeed nutrition.\nFor instance, the\nconsumption of foods\nthat are high in L-Tyrosine\nsuch as aged Parmesan cheese,\nfor instance, of all things.\nVery, very high in L-Tyrosine.\nThe precursor to dopamine.\nCertain foods.\nYou can look up\nonline which foods\ncontain high levels\nof L-Tyrosine\nand which ones are compatible\nwith your nutrition.\nBut leaving pharmacology\naside, there's\na very exciting\nnonpharmacological tool.\nA purely behavioral tool\nthat the research literature\nhas told us can selectively\nincrease dopamine\nwithin the\nnigrostriatal pathway.\nThe pathway that's involved\nin divergent thinking.\nAnd can do so very dramatically\nas much as 65% above baseline.\nAnd so this is a\nbehavioral tool that\nis useful for a number of things\nbut that I find particularly\ninteresting in leveraging\ntowards the exploration\nand enhancement of creativity\nbecause first of all,\nit's purely behavioral.\nSo it's 0 cost.\nAnd it involves no manipulation\nof brain neuromodulators\nor chemistry through\npharmacology.\nSo it's something that you\ncan explore very safely\nand certainly not having\nto purchase anything.\nAnd what's really remarkable\nis the selectivity\nor I think it's fair to\nsay the immense selectivity\nthat this particular\nbehavioral intervention seems\nto exert on dopamine within\nthis pathway associated\nwith divergent thinking.\nSo the study that\nI'm about to describe\nis a study that\ndates back 20 years.\nNow, that should\nnot concern you.\nIn fact, the early arrival\nof this study or what\nnow seems to be early arrival.\nI mean, it wasn't that long\nago, is really exciting\nbecause the first\nline of this study\nreally illustrates how important\nor how much of a landmark study\nthis really is.\nAnd so I'll just read you\nthe first line of the study,\nthen I'll tell you\nthe title, then I'll\ntell you what they discovered\nin fairly top contour\nand we will provide\na link to the study\nif you want to peruse\nit in more detail.\nThe first line of the study\nis this is the first in vivo,\njust meaning in the organism.\nIn this case, this\nwas a study on humans.\nThis is the first in\nvivo demonstration\nof an association between an\nendogenous neurotransmitter\nrelease, endogenous means within\nus, and conscious experience.\nSo what this sentence\nessentially says\nis this is the first study\nexploring how a chemical that's\nnaturally released in our body\nrelates to a particular quality\nof conscious experience.\nThis study was performed\nin Scandinavia,\nin one of the\nhospitals in Denmark.\nAgain, we'll provide a link.\nThe first author is Kjaer.\nI think I'm pronouncing it\ncorrectly although probably not\nK-J-A-E-R et al.\nAnd the title of the\nstudy is Increased\nDopamine Tone During\nMeditation Induced\nChange of Consciousness.\nAnd I want to just highlight\nthat the meditation used\nin this study isn't really\na meditation at all.\nI don't know why they\nselected that for the title.\nThe behavioral protocol\nused in the study\nwas more akin to what is\nnormally called yoga nidra\nor NSDR nonsleep depressed.\nNow yoga nidra and NSDR have\nbeen discussed many times\nbefore on this podcast.\nYoga nidra, for\ninstance, is a practice\nthat's been around for hundreds\nif not thousands of years\nin which people\ndeliberately lie still.\nSo they're forcing themselves\nto be mostly motionless,\nsmall movements are fine.\nAnd they're directing\ntheir attention\nto the surface of\ntheir body, they're\ndoing long exhale breathing.\nSometimes some intentions,\nsometimes some visualization.\nBut it's really\nself-directed relaxation.\nAnd the key component is that\npeople stay awake and engage\nin very little movement.\nAnd the key word\nthere is movement.\nNow, nonsleep depressed is a\nacronym, a term that I coined.\nIt's not a term that\nI coined in order\nto try and wipe away or\ndiscard with yoga nidra.\nI'm a person who has\ngreat respect for yoga\nnidra and its traditions.\nIt's a term that\nI coined in order\nto encompass a number of\npractices that don't include\nany mystical type language\nor scientific language\nfor that matter.\nAnd that doesn't\ninvolve intentions.\nIt involves deep relaxation\nyet remaining wide awake\nand conscious.\nSometimes people fall\nasleep and that's OK.\nBut this is really an\natypical brain state\nof being deeply relaxed yet in\ngeneral awake and motionless.\nAgain, motionless being the key.\nVery few brain states involve us\nbeing mostly if not completely\nmotionless and yet awake.\nAnd it turns out that\nbrain state whether or not\nyou call it yoga nidra,\nyou call it NSDR,\nwhether or not you call it\nmeditation induced shift\nin consciousness as\nthey did in this study,\nalthough they do\nrefer to yoga nidra,\nall refer to the same thing,\nwhich is being motionless\nand yet aware and relaxed.\nI should mention.\nSo in this study,\nwhat they did was\nthey subjects into\nthe laboratory.\nThey had them either undergo\nthis self-directed deep\nrelaxation while they are\nmotionless or mostly motionless\nor they had them listen\nto an audio script\nwhile also just lying\nthere with eyes closed.\nAnd then they used a\nnumber of chemical tricks.\nAnd I don't want to\nget too deep into those\nnow because they can be\na little bit distracting.\nFor those of you\nthat are interested,\nyou can look at it in the study.\nThis is a binding of a\nchemical in the brain\nthat then they can image\nwith brain imaging, which\nis what they did in the study\nto evaluate how much dopamine\nchanged in the brain\nand where specifically\nin the brain dopamine\nchanged its levels before,\nduring, and after this\nparticular behavioral practice\nin one or the other group.\nAnd what they discovered\nis that people\nwho did this deep\nrelaxation, that\nis, self-directed deep\nrelaxation lying their eyes\nclosed, relatively motionless\nalthough small movements\nof the body or movements of\nthe head are absolutely fine.\nWhat they observed was a 65%\nincrease in dopamine release.\nNow, here its key.\nDopamine release.\nAnd they observed an increase\nin so-called theta activity.\nTheta activity is a pattern\nof brain wave activity that's\ncommonly associated\nwith creative states\nand divergent thinking\nin particular.\nSo that's important.\nAnd they observe\nthat across subjects\nspecifically in the\nnigrostriatal pathway.\nThis pathway associated\nwith divergent thinking.\nSo this is very exciting.\nThis is a study\nthat really points\nto a behavioral tool that can\nbe used to selectively elevate\ndopamine in the very pathway\nthat one would want to if they\nwanted to engage divergent\nthinking for sake\nof creative exploration.\nThere are also a number of key\nobservations within this study.\nFirst of all, the reduction in\nbodily movement was essential.\nIn fact, when people rated or\nwhen the amount of readiness\nfor action in their system,\ntheir body was evaluated.\nWhat people found was that\nimmediately after this practice\nthey felt very still.\nIn other words, they felt as\nif remaining still was natural.\nNow it's not the case\nthat they couldn't move.\nIn fact, the\nelevation in dopamine\nthat occurred during\nthis practice, this yoga\nnidra-like nonsleep or\nNSDR-like practice, actually\nprepared them to be able to\nmove in a much more dedicated\nand robust way afterwards.\nBut during the practice,\ntheir readiness for action\nwent way, way down.\nNot surprising.\nThey were pretty\nmuch motionless.\nBut interestingly, as the\nlevel of readiness for movement\nwent down, down,\ndown, down down,\ntheir degree of\nvisual imagery, that\nis, their internal\nlandscape and their ability\nto imagine new things increased.\nAnd in fact, areas\nof the brain that\nare associated\nwith visual imagery\nsuch as the visual or\nso-called occipital\ncortex and the parietal cortex\nhas been shown in other studies\nto ramp up when\npeople are motionless.\nSo there seems to be\nthis inverse relationship\nbetween movement and visual\nimagery which makes sense.\nWhen we're moving\nwe can pay attention\nto things in the\noutside world, we\ntend to be aware of our sensory\nenvironment to varying degrees.\nBut we don't tend to be very\nfocused on visual imagery\nwithin our head whereas when we\nlie down or sit down and close\nour eyes and we are motionless,\nthe degree of visual imagery\nreally increases.\nHence, the increase\nin divergent thinking\nbecause what\nessentially is happening\nis the library of\noptions, the library\nof possible interactions\nwith whatever it\nis that you're thinking about.\nI gave the example, which\nis a trivial one on purpose\nof a pen.\nBut the bank of options\nthat becomes available\nwhen we are motionless\nand when we are limiting\nour visualization of\nthe external world\nincreases exponentially.\nSo this is important.\nAnd what it points\nto is the fact\nthat this very simple completely\nnonpharmacologic behavioral\npractice of lying\ndown motionless\nfor some period of time.\nAnd I confess the amount\nof time that they use\nin the study was quite long.\nIt was longer than 60 minutes.\nBut all the data that I'm aware\nof in terms of NSDR and yoga\nnidra, and there's a\ngrowing body of literature\non these practices\nI should mention,\nshow that even 10\nminutes or even better\nwould be 20 or 30 minutes\nof lying motionless\nwith eyes closed and\nallowing the mind to drift,\nwherever it happens\nto go, but focusing\non relaxing by doing\nlong exhale breathing,\nperhaps doing a body\nscan or focusing\nyour attention on\nparticular body parts\nbut not keeping it focused\non any one particular body\npart for that long, that general\npractice of deep relaxation\nwhile awake and being\nrelatively motionless really\nfavors the brain\nstates associated\nwith divergent thinking.\nAnd actually\nrepresents an accessing\nof the various\ncomponents that you would\nuse during divergent thinking.\nAnd perhaps most\nexcitingly, it's\nassociated with this massive\nincrease, 65% increase\nin dopamine release within\nthe very pathway that\nunderlies divergent thinking.\nSo my recommendation\nwould be for those of you\nthat are trying to\nenhance divergent thinking\nand creative ability, that\nyou would do this practice\nat a minimum once per week.\nAnd I should say if you were\ngoing to do it once per week,\nI would recommend doing it\nfor about 20 to 30 minutes.\nSome of you might be able to do\nit for as long as 60 minutes.\nI myself do such a practice\non a daily basis, anywhere\nfrom 10 minutes to 20\nminutes, sometimes 30 minutes.\nThere's an example of an NSDR\nscript, completely zero cost.\nI confess it does\nhappen to be my voice.\nSo forgive me in advance.\nThere are other options of NSDR.\nYou can go to YouTube,\nput NSDR and my name.\nAgain, completely zero cost.\nYou can get a sample of\nwhat a 10 minute NSDR\nscript looks like.\nThat's through Virtusan,\nput that out there.\nSo thank you Virtusan for\nputting that out there\nat zero cost.\nThere are examples of 20 and\n30 minute NSDR scripts and yoga\nnidra scripts.\nSome that I particularly like.\nWe will also provide a\nlink to some of those.\nAgain, those are completely\nzero cost for you to explore.\nBut more important than you\nfollow any one particular yoga\nnidra NSDR script\nis that you learn\nto take your body and brain into\nthese states of limited motion,\nelevated dopamine within\nthis particular pathway,\nand fairly deep relaxation.\nAgain, if you happen\nto fall asleep,\nthat's not necessarily\na bad thing,\nalthough the idea\nis that you stay\nin a shallow plane\nof consciousness\nor sleep hence the term\nnonsleep deep rest.\nSo in any event, I think this\nis a very useful practice\nthat many people\ncould benefit from.\nAnd the fact that it's zero\ncost and purely behavioral,\nI think adds additional\nbenefit because it's\ncertainly one that\npeople could explore\ndepending on what amount of\ntime you're willing to commit.\nAnd the research\ndata on this now\nextend beyond this\none individual paper.\nAnd I think is really\nexciting because what it says\nis as the title and\nfirst line of the paper\nsuggests is that we\ncan increase dopamine\nusing specific types\nof meditation induced\nconsciousness.\nAnd those increases\nin dopamine can\nbe used to increase our\nability to be more creative.\nBefore moving forward, I\nwant to make absolutely clear\nhow it is that you\nwould use an NSDR a.k.a.\nyoga nidra or similar,\nthe name doesn't really\nmatter after all, the\npractice is what matters,\nin order to enhance dopamine\nin this nigrostriatal pathway\nand enhance divergent thinking.\nThe key thing to\nunderstand here is\nthat the period\nof motionlessness\nand deep relaxation\nwhile awake increases\ndopamine in the\nnigrostriatal pathway.\nIt increases mental imagery.\nThat is, it increases access to\nthe bank or the library, if you\nwill, of possible\nsolutions or elements\nto engage in the divergent\nthinking process.\nBut divergent thinking\nitself does not\noccur during NSDR a.k.a.\nyoga nidra.\nThe NSDR and yoga nidra, a\ndeep relaxation meditation,\nwhatever it is you want to call\nit, sets a dopaminergic tone.\nAnd that's actually the\nappropriate use of the word\ndopaminergic tone it\nraises the baseline\nof dopamine transmission\nin that circuitry that\nthen positions you to\nengage in divergent thinking\nmore effectively.\nSo the idea would be to\ndo anywhere from 10 to 20,\nmaybe 30 minutes, maybe\neven as much as an hour,\ndepending on how much time\nyou had to dedicate of such\na meditation and NSDR practice.\nAnd then not\nnecessarily immediately\nbut within the 5 to 15\nminutes following, then\nto go into a practice\nof divergent thinking\nand start doing\ncreative exploration.\nThat is to start thinking\nabout different ways\nto combine existing\nelements in whatever domain\nit is that you want\nto achieve creativity.\nSo the point is that the\ndivergent thinking itself\nis not occurring during the\nNSDR or yoga nidra practice.\nThe NSDR and yoga nidra\npractice prepares you\nfor divergent thinking that\nyou do in the hour or hours\nthat follows.\nAnd just to contrast\nthat with pharmacology,\nI am not aware of any specific\ndopamine related pharmacology\nthat would allow us to\nselectively increase dopamine\nin the very pathway associated\nwith divergent thinking\nand creativity.\nNow, there are forms\nof pharmacology\nthat can shift brain\nneurotransmitters\nand modulators in ways\nthat favor creativity.\nAnd this is certainly\na topic that we\nwe'll go into in more\ndepth in a future episode.\nBut there's an\nexciting study that\nwas performed just\nthis last year looking\nat the role of serotonin,\nanother neuromodulator,\nin divergent and\nconvergent thinking.\nAnd it turns out that serotonin\nunderlies a lot of the brain\nactivity that's responsible\nfor both divergent\nand for convergent thinking.\nAnd there's one particular\nform of pharmacology\nwhich can enhance activation\nof the serotonergic pathways\nassociated with the so-called\n5-HT, that's serotonin.\n5-HT, that's the abbreviation.\n5-HT2A receptor.\nSerotonin 2A receptor in\nparticular brain areas\nin ways that favor both\ndivergent and convergent\nthinking.\nAnd the pharmacologic\nagent in that case\nturns out to be very low\ndose or as some of you\nmay have heard of it referred\nto as microdosing of psilocybin.\nNow, I do want to say because it\nwould be entirely inappropriate\nfor me to not say this, that\nin most areas of the world\nand particularly in\nthe United States,\npsilocybin is still illegal.\nIt is not legal.\nIn some areas it has\nbeen decriminalized\nand there are a number of\ndifferent clinical trials\noccurring now at Johns\nHopkins, at Stanford,\nat University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco,\nand elsewhere\nexploring psilocybin\nfor the treatment of\ndepression, for trauma,\nfor eating disorders.\nMost of those studies focus\non macrodoses of psilocybin\nnot microdosing.\nThere are far fewer studies\nof microdosing of psilocybin.\nAnd I do have to point\nout that psilocybin use\nand possession and, of\ncourse, sale is still illegal.\nSo I would be remiss\nif I didn't state that.\nHowever, I will provide\na link to the study that\nshows that microdosing\nof psilocybin\nfor a series of weeks\non a daily basis.\nSo these are dosages\nof psilocybin\nthat do not induce hallucination\nand do not massively\nshift mood or internal states in\nany way that has people feeling\nlike they are acting\nor feeling that\nmuch different although\nsome people do report\na subjective shift.\nDoes seem to increase\ndivergent thinking ability.\nBut I do want to put a\nbig asterisks, a highlight\nin an underlying beneath the\nstatement I'm about to make,\nwhich is that pharmacology\nof the serotonin system\njust as pharmacology\nof the dopamine system\nis very broadband.\nIt's a shotgun approach.\nYou're going to hit\nall the circuits\nof the brain that\ninvolve serotonin\nwith microdosing psilocybin.\nAlthough it has some selectivity\nfor the 5-HT2A receptor\nit can attach to other\nreceptors as well and act there.\nThis is the same reason why\nSSRI, Selective Serotonin\nReuptake Inhibitors can\nindeed shift mood and appetite\nbut it can also shift\nlibido and other things.\nIt's because there are\nserotonin receptors everywhere,\nor I should say many\nplaces, not just in\nthe areas of the brain that\nare associated with mood,\nfor instance.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nagents, whether or not they\nare recreational or illicit\ndrugs or prescription drugs\nor supplements that\nincrease dopamine will also\nbe broadband into a number of\ndifferent circuits in parallel.\nSo this is why I always\nsay behavioral tools really\nshould come first.\nI don't say that because\nI dislike pharmacology,\nI say that because in many\ncases behavioral tools are not\nonly safer and easier\nto titrate to adjust\nthe duration, et cetera\nthan is pharmacology,\nbut also because\nthey can sometimes\nas in the case of\nthe study we just\ndescribed for you more\nspecificity not less than\npharmacology.\nPharmacology has its\nplace can be wonderful,\nprovided safe and\nlegal, et cetera.\nBut it can cause a lot of\nso-called off target effects.\nSo for those of you that\nare interested in increasing\ncreativity through\npharmacology, I\nwould say, stay tuned for\nthe data on psilocybin\nand microdosing psilocybin.\nIf you are absolutely obsessed\nwith the idea of microdosing\npsilocybin for\nenhancing creativity\nand you'd like to go\nstraight to the study,\nI will tell you what that\nstudy is and therefore you\ncan access some of the\nspecifics in terms of dosages\nand protocols, et cetera.\nSo since I can't\nhelp myself, I'll\njust very briefly summarize that\nmicrodosing psychedelic study.\nThe title of the study,\nwhich was published in 2018\nis Exploring the Effect of\nMicrodosing Psychedelics\non Creativity in an Open\nLabel Natural Setting.\nInteresting title.\nThis was a microdosing\nevent organized\nby the Dutch\npsychedelic society.\nThey examined the effects\nof psychedelic truffles\nwhere they knew what psychedelic\ncompounds were contained there\non two creativity related\nproblem solving task,\nthe picture concept task, which\nI don't expect you to recognize\nor know but it assesses\nconvergent thinking\nand the alternative\nuses task which\nI also don't expect\nyou to know but is\na standard task for\nassessing divergent thinking.\nThey tested once before\ntaking a microdose\nand while the effects were\nexpected to be manifested\nthey say.\nInteresting.\nThey use the word manifested\nin a study of psychedelics.\nScience is changing indeed.\nIn any case, what they found\nwas an enhancement of creative.\nThat is, divergent and\nconvergent thinking\nnot surprising given the\nfact that the 5-HT2A receptor\nactivity is increased by\nmicrodosing of psilocybin\nand 5-HT2A receptors are present\nboth on the neural circuits\nthat underlie divergent\nand convergent thinking.\nSo, again, this is not a plug\nfor microdosing psilocybin.\nThis is really in\nresponse to what\nI know will be a number of\ndifferent questions about what\npharmacologic agents can be\nused to increase creativity.\nSo more on that later\nand, again, we'll\nprovide a link if you want to\nread that study in more depth.\nI can imagine that\na number of you\nare probably also wondering\nabout the effects of alcohol\nand the effects of\ncannabis on creativity.\nWe did a long in-depth\nepisode all about alcohol\nand its effects on health.\nThe bottom line on\nalcohol is that in excess\nof two drinks per\nweek, you're starting\nto run into the cancer promoting\nand toxic effects of alcohol.\nI didn't choose for\nthe answer to be that,\nbut that's what\nthe data tell us.\nI'm not telling you you can't\ndrink more than two drinks\nper week, I'm just saying that\nif you're going to do that,\nyou should really\nconsider offsetting\nthat with some other\nbehavioral measures\nall discussed in the\nepisode on alcohol.\nAnd despite what\npeople think, there\nis absolutely zero evidence that\nalcohol increases creativity.\nHowever, by way of\nreducing activation\nof the prefrontal cortex,\nthere is some evidence\nthat alcohol and\nother substances\nthat reduce what's called\nautobiographical scripting,\nthat is, a narrative\nabout ourselves,\nso self awareness, that it\ncan enhance divergent thinking\nat very low doses.\nAnd this makes sense.\nDivergent thinking involves\nremembering certain things\nthat we can use as elements\nin the creative process\nbut suppressing narratives\nabout what the use of those\nwould mean.\nWill people like it?\nWill they not like it?\nWill it to the outcome we want?\nWell, it won't.\nAll of that\nautobiographical scripting\ninvolves the forebrain\nbeing very, very active\nand specific regions of the\nforebrain in particular.\nAnd that all needs\nto be suppressed,\nwhich alcohol in very\nlow doses can accomplish.\nBut, again, that's not\na plug for alcohol.\nI think behavioral tools\nwould be a much better route.\nBut therefore it\nshouldn't be surprising\nwhy some people have used\nlow dose alcohol in order\nto engage in the\ncreative process\nbecause it involves\nless inhibition\nor sense of self that could be\ndetrimental to the divergent\nthinking process.\nNow, with respect to\ncannabis, I went in depth\ninto the biology and the\nvarious uses, misuses,\ndangers, and in some cases\nbenefits of cannabis use\nin certain.\nThe key word there is\ncertain populations.\nAnd I also dove\ninto whether or not\ncannabis can be used to increase\ndivergent and convergent\nthinking.\nSo that's timestamped\nin that episode.\nI'll refer you to that episode.\nBut the long and short of\nit is that many of the ideas\nthat people come up with when\nunder the influence of cannabis\nin particular high THC\ncontaining cannabis does lead\nto enhanced divergent\nthinking, but so enhanced\nit turns out that\noftentimes those ideas can't\nbe constrained by the\nconvergent thinking process.\nIn other words, they\nhave lots of ideas\nthat make sense while under\nthe influence of cannabis.\nBut that later cannot be\nimplemented into a coherent\nframework that leads to any\nactual creative endeavor\nor creative product.\nOr, as is often the\ncase with cannabis,\nthey simply can't remember\nwhat they were thinking about.\nAny time there's a\ndiscussion about dopamine,\nthere seems to be a discussion\nabout motivation, desire,\nand drive.\nAnd, of course, that makes sense\ngiven the roles of dopamine.\nWe did an entire episode\non dopamine, motivation,\nand drive.\nIt's one of our most\npopular episodes.\nAgain, you can access that\nwith timestamps and all formats\nat hubermanlab.com.\nAnd any time\nthere's a discussion\nabout dopamine and\nmotivation, we also\nseem to have a lot of questions\nabout attention and focus\nand ADHD or attention\ndeficit hyperactivity\ndisorder in particular.\nSo just as a brief\nmention, there\nis a literature although\nnot terribly extensive,\na small but strong literature\non the relationship\nbetween ADHD and creativity.\nAnd the long and short\nof that literature\nis that people who have\nADHD regardless of age\ndo seem to have an\nability to focus.\nI've mentioned that\nin the episode on ADHD\nprovided that they are\ninterested in the thing\nthat they are focusing on.\nSo that runs counter to this\nidea that people with ADHD\nsimply can't focus.\nThey can but it tends to be a\nfocus that selective for things\nthat they are very excited about\nor interested in as opposed\nto a general ability to focus.\nWhat's also highly\nunderappreciated\nis that people who\nhave ADHD oftentimes\nare very effective\nat divergent thinking\nbut are less effective\nat convergent thinking.\nWhat this tells us is\nthat people with ADHD\ncan often have excellent novel\nand indeed creative ideas,\nbut that the implementation\nof those creative ideas\nis sometimes challenge.\nAnd that's one reason to\nexplore rational pharmacology,\nnutrition,\nsupplementation, et cetera.\nThose are all things\nto explore in concert\nwith or I should say in\nworking closely with a board\ncertified physician or ideally\npsychiatrist expert in ADHD.\nYou can also check out the\nepisode that we did on ADHD.\nThere are a lot of tools there.\nA lot of science mentioned\nthere to support those tools.\nAgain, you can find\nthat Hubermanlab.com.\nBut I did think it was\nimportant to point out,\neven if briefly that having ADHD\nis not a barrier to creativity\nand, in fact, may actually be\nan enhanced portal to creativity\nbut that it doesn't\nallow people to access\nthe convergent thinking that\nallows creative ideas to be\nimplemented into specific\nstrategies, pressure tested,\nand eventually delivered in\nthe form of a final product\nof music, art, et cetera.\nThat is not to say that people\nwith ADHD cannot accomplish\nthat, but that it is going to\nrequire some additional steps\nand protocols in order to\nenhance convergent thinking.\nAnd that episode and\nthe episode that we\ndid on focus and in particular\ntools to enhance focus\nis very much directed at ways\nto enhance convergent thinking.\nSo if you have ADHD or\nknow somebody who does\nand you're interested\nin the creative process,\nwe're focusing generally\nplease check out the episodes\nthat I mentioned.\nNow, there's also a small\nbut nonetheless very exciting\nliterature on the relationship\nbetween physical movement\nand divergent thinking.\nThis should come as\nno surprise to us.\nAs mentioned many times\nnow in this episode,\nthe nigrostriatal pathway\ninvolved in divergent thinking\nthat involves dopamine is also\nresponsible for eye blinks\nand for movements of the\nlimbs of the body in very\ndeliberate ways.\nThis tells us that there's\nsome direct or maybe\nindirect relationship\nbetween movement\nof the body and\ndivergent thinking.\nAnd despite the fact that\nit's only a few studies,\nthere have been some studies\nof whether or not people are\nable to engage in\ndivergent thinking\nmore effectively when\nthey are doing things\nlike pacing or walking.\nAnd this could be on a\ntreadmill or back and forth\nacross the room.\nAnd in fact, that is\nabsolutely the case.\nIf you're somebody\nlike myself who\ntends to have their\nbest ideas, not\nsaying that my ideas are always\nterrific, but among the ideas\nI have, some of the better\nones arrive to me while\non my long Sunday run.\nI tend to do a long\nrun or hike on Sundays\nsometimes with a light weight\nvest or something of that sort.\nBut when I'm in a state\nof essentially not\ndirecting my attention\nto any one thing\nin my external environment, this\nis extremely key for reasons\nthat now should be obvious.\nAny time we are\ndirecting our attention\nto a visual target\nor an auditory target\nwe are not as able to engage\nin divergent thinking.\nThis is why I will\nsometimes listen\nto podcasts or to audiobooks\nwhile I go on these runs.\nBut for portions of\nthese runs or hikes\nI tend to turn those off and\njust focus on the movement\nand focus on not focusing\non anything in particular.\nAnd oftentimes I will stop and\nwrite down ideas that suddenly\nor seemingly suddenly appear\nto me or geyser to the surface.\nI'll have an idea.\nSometimes those are good ideas,\nsometimes less good ideas.\nThe fact that happens\nfor me and the fact\nthat many people are\npacers or runners\nor come up with their best\nideas while in the shower\nor while engaging in\nactivities that don't require\na lot of sensory\nattention to one\nspecific location either\nvisual or auditory,\net cetera, that is because it\nengages these nigrostriatal\npathways through movement\nwhich then opens up\nthis library of ideas and\nallows the intersection\nof different ideas that\nnormally would be constrained\nto separate categories.\nOne way to think\nabout this by analogy\nwould be when I was a kid\nyou'd go to the library,\nnowadays you just go online.\nBut the different pages\nof different books\non different topics are kept\ndistinct from one another.\nThat is bound by different\nbook covers and book\nends, different\nshelves in the library.\nIt's as if different pages\nand elements from those books\nare now being combined\nin a pseudo random.\nNot random but in a\npseudo random way.\nAnd in that combination,\nnew possibilities\nabout ways that information\ncould be combined\nand implemented start to arise.\nSo the tool that emerges\nfrom this is very simple.\nAnd it won't necessarily\napply to everybody.\nBut if you are\nsomebody who finds\nthat just sitting in a chair\nand trying to be creative\nis very challenging, some\nof you might benefit from,\nfor instance, if\nyou are engaging\nin writing or you want to\nwrite to talk into the voice\nrecorder of your phone while\nwalking or simply walking\nand not attending to any\none specific thing visually\nor through headphones.\nAnd then as ideas\nsurface, seemingly\nout of nowhere, which\nis how it happens,\nthat you could either\nput them into your phone\nby voice dictation or you could\ntype them out if you like.\nThe key thing is to\nnot be distracted\nby other things\nin your phone, not\nto start going onto social\nmedia or doing phone calls\nor looking at text messages\nbecause that by definition\nis going to take you out\nof this what biologists\ncall a pseudo random walk.\nAnd this pseudo random element\nis extremely important.\nWe know, for instance, that\nmany circuits within the brain\nhave what's called dedicated\npoint to point wiring.\nSo, for instance,\nthe brain circuits\nthat govern your breathing.\nThe brain circuits that\ngovern your heartbeat.\nThe brain circuits that\ngovern your specific movements\nonce you are an adult and allow\nfor smooth directed movement\nare very precise, very little\nslop if any in the wiring.\nHowever, there are aspects of\nyour brain circuitry, yours\nand everybody\nelse's I should say,\nthat are maintained\ninto adulthood that\ninclude a lot of extra wiring.\nAnd these are fine wires.\nThey are not the major highways\nbetween different areas,\nif you will.\nSo like Google Maps has highways\nand streets and little passages\nand alleys.\nBut it's as if\nthere's a little web\nof additional possible pathways\ncast over that entire thing.\nThe human brain maintains\nsuch webs of possible passage.\nAnd it's only during activities\nsuch as walking, running,\ncycling, swimming,\nhiking, pacing, et\ncetera that the activation of\nthose pseudo random pathways\nstarts to ramp up.\nSo this is a purely\nbehavioral approach\nto engaging different elements\nwithin neural networks that\nnormally would not\ncommunicate with one another\nwhen we are completely still.\nSo again, the\npractices that I talked\nabout earlier of being\ncompletely still to raise\ndopamine and enhanced\ndivergent thinking--\nI just want to\nreemphasize are designed\nto position you to\nready you to engage\nin the activities like\nwalking and pacing,\net cetera, that best\nfacilitate divergent thinking.\nSo if you are somebody who wants\nto enhance divergent thinking,\nI would encourage\nyou to explore how\ndifferent patterns of movement\nin particular, patterns\nof movement that don't require\nany conscious attention\nto any one specific thing\nallow you to access new ideas\nand new ways of combining\nexisting elements\nin whatever domain it is\nyou want to be creative.\nNow, this is also an opportunity\nto underscore something\nI said back at the\nbeginning, which\nis you are not going to come\nup with great works of music\nif you don't understand\nchords and melodies and notes\nand music.\nThose basic elements\nhave to be built up\nthrough some formal or at least\nrigorous or regular training.\nIn the same way that you're\nnot going to take a walk,\nand then suddenly\nbe able to paint\nan incredible picture if you\nhave no painting ability.\nThat is not going to happen.\nWhat I'm talking\nabout here are ways\nto enhance your capacity\nfor divergent thinking,\nsuch as NSDR and ways to\nengage in divergent thinking,\nsuch as through certain forms\nof movement that don't require\na lot of conscious attention\nto your surroundings or any one\nspecific sensory target.\nAnd in doing so,\nenhancing your ability\nto be more creative in a\ndomain for which you already\nhave some degree of\nskill or even mastery.\nNow, in keeping with\nthe theme of how\nto enhance our\ncreativity, there's\na very exciting and yet parallel\nliterature to the literature\nthat I've been\ndescribing thus far.\nNow, I promise you\nthat I'm not going\nto open up an entire\nlibrary of new information\nrelated to neural\ncircuits and so forth.\nBut I would be remiss\nif I didn't mention\nthis parallel literature because\nit speaks very specifically\nto some important practices\nthat we can all use in order\nto enhance creativity.\nAnd to do so the first\ntime and every time.\nAnd this is really because\ncertain scientists out there\nhave really gone\nthrough the trouble.\nI should even say the\npainstaking trouble\nof really trying to dissect\nwhat the creative process is\nboth for individuals and\nin groups or even in pairs.\nAnd so what I'm about to tell\nyou is beautifully encapsulated\nin an article entitled--\n\"A new method for\ntraining creativity--\nnarrative as an alternative\nto divergent thinking.\"\nSo again, we've been talking\nabout divergent thinking.\nThat's one pathway into\nthe creative process\nbut there are others as well.\nAnd as it turns\nout, they're not so\ndistinct in terms of the\nunderlying brain mechanisms.\nNonetheless, let\nme describe briefly\nhow narrative can be\nused to train creativity\nand to become more creative.\nAnd in order to\ndo that, I'd like\nto just briefly\nparaphrase or read\nfrom the first\nparagraph of this paper.\nSo what I'm about to read are\nthe author's words, not mine.\nQuote \"Here's a paradox.\nAccording to current\nresearch young children\nare more imaginatively\ncreative than adults.\"\nAnd indeed that is\ntrue, by the way.\n\"Yet also according\nto current research,\ncreativity is main neural\nengine is divergent thinking,\nwhich relies on memory\nand logical association\nto tasks at which young\nchildren underperform adults.\"\nThat is, children are not as\ngood at divergent thinking\nas adults are.\nSo how could it\nbe the authors are\nasking that children are\nmore imaginative and thus\nmore creative than adults.\nThis can only mean that\nthere are alternate pathways\nto creativity.\nAnd indeed that is the case.\nAnd so what this\npaper really explores\nis other ways to\naccess creativity.\nAnd what they describe is\nwhat's called narrative theory.\nAnd there's a number\nof different aspects\nto this narrative theory.\nBut they agree that the standard\ndefinition of creativity\nis the same one that we\nwere talking about before.\nSo we're not talking about a\ndifferent form of creativity,\nhere we're talking\nabout a different way\nto access creativity.\nThey describe the standard\ndefinition of creativity\nas quote \"The\nability to generate\nnovel ideas that are useful.\"\nSo the commonly accepted one.\nAnd what they cite as the\nbasis for narrative theory\nis this breakthrough\nfinding in the 1950s.\nThis is the work of Guilford\nSome people out there\nmight be familiar with it.\nI was not at the outset of\nresearching this episode.\nWhat this theory from\nGuilford essentially states\nis that there are different\nintellectual capacities that\nare not captured by\nstandard IQ tests.\nI think that's generally\naccepted nowadays.\nWe know there's\nemotional intelligence,\nwe know the standard\nIQ, et cetera.\nBut the important\nelement to understand\nis that these authors\nwere able to trace back\nthe idea of narrative\ntraining as a way\nto enhance creativity long\nbefore Guilford in the 1950s,\nall the way back to Aristotle.\nSo this is incredible.\nNarrative theory\nwas actually birthed\nin 335 BCE in his\nwriting called Poetics,\nwhich I think is\nincredible at least to me\nthat people long before us\nwere thinking about creativity\nand what goes into creativity.\nAnd what Aristotle said, what\nGuilford then elaborated on\nand what the authors\nof this paper\nfurther elaborate\non and actually have\ndeveloped training\nprotocols for,\nis the idea that there are\nthree elements that we can use\nin order to enhance creativity.\nAnd those three\nelements are what's\ncalled world\nbuilding, I'll explain\nwhat these are in a moment,\nperspective shifting,\nand action generating.\nAnd right off the\nbat, the word action\nshould raise a flag for you.\nAnd by that I mean a positive\nflag because once again,\nwe are back into the world and\ntherefore the neural circuits\nof movement and motion.\nSo three elements of world\nbuilding perspective, shifting,\nand active generating are\nwhat make up this narrative\napproach to creativity.\nAnd I should mention that\nthese authors and others are\nusing such approach with\ncompanies, with groups,\nwith individuals.\nSo this is using a bunch\nof different contexts\nto approach and enhance\ndifferent forms of creativity.\nSo let's talk first about\nworld building techniques.\nThis is going to be\nimmediately familiar to you\nwhen you hear it.\nBut one of the key elements of\ncreativity is to at the outset\ncome up with some idea\nthat makes sense or is\nattractive to you about how\nthe world is different inside\nof your creative endeavor.\nSo for those that\nwrite science fiction\nor think about\nscience fiction, there\nare some obvious\naspects to this.\nBut for those of you\nthat don't, maybe you\ncome up with a\nnarrative, for instance,\nin the context of storytelling\nthat in your world\nwe are the house\ncats and the cats\nare actually the ones that\nare the curators of the Earth.\nOK.\nSo right there, there\nis a conceptual shift\nthat the world in which\nwhatever creative idea is going\nto emerge is entirely\ndifferent than the one\nthat we actually live in.\nSo that sets a certain number\nof important constraints.\nIt means certain things\nare now possible,\nother things are\nnot possible that\nare very different from\nthe world that we live in.\nYou can see the parallels here\nto childhood imagination where\nessentially anything can\nhappen in the child's mind\nbecause they are unconstrained.\nThe second element\nis this perspective\nshifting techniques.\nAnd the idea here is\nthat not only are we\nsupposed to have the reader or\nthe listener or the observer\nor us explore for creativity\nand develop a creative idea\nby thinking differently\nwhich is a generic term.\nHow do we actually\nthink differently.\nBut rather than just say take\nthe perspective of somebody\nelse in terms of what\nthey would see or do\nor say or think\nrather, we are supposed\nto think about their\nunderlying motivation.\nSo we could do the world shift,\nthat is the world structure\nshift from step one.\nAnd then in step two, you\nwould ask yourself OK,\nrather than write about\nor think about or move\nfrom the perspective\nof myself, let's say,\nyou're feeling particularly\nhappy that day.\nYou'd say, I'm actually\ngoing to take the perspective\nof somebody who's angry.\nBut rather than\njust act angry, I'm\ngoing to think about what their\nmotivation for being angry is.\nMaybe they had a breakup.\nMaybe they were jealous.\nMaybe somebody had\nwronged them in some way.\nMaybe they're just generally\nangry at the world for whatever\nreason and then operate from\nthat motivational stance.\nAnd this is a very\ninteresting and powerful step\nbecause what it really\ncaptures at least\nas viewed by me,\nthe neuroscientists,\nis it captures a whole set\nof neural circuits about what\nthat motivational state means\nbecause motivational states\ndictate a huge number of\npossible different outcomes,\nbut they really constrain the\nnumber of different actions\nand outcomes that any\nof us would engage in.\nRather than saying I'm going\nto view the world the way\nthat someone else\nwill view the world,\nby stating that we are\ngoing to be motivated\nby their set of motivations\nand not our own,\nit includes a lot more\npossibilities and yet not\nan infinite number\nof possibilities.\nThey are constrained\nin a logical way,\nwhich is one of the key\nelements of creativity.\nAnd then the third\nelement, which\nis action generating techniques\nis a really cool one that you\nwill immediately\nnotice implications\nfor the workplace, which\nis forced collaboration.\nSo inside of this thing\nthat we're building here,\nthis story, you create a\nnovel rule for the world\nthat your story is\ngoing to exist in\nor your music is going to exist\nin or your sport will exist in.\nThen you create this\nperspective shift\nwhere you take on the\nmotivation of someone\nelse different than\nyou and then you\nforce collaboration\nbetween that person who\nhas this alternate\nmotivation different from you\nand someone else who has an\nentirely different motivation.\nAnd in doing so,\nyou create these\nwhat are called the\ncreative collisions.\nNow they're collisions because\nthey're crossing one another\nand something new has\nto emerge from them.\nThey could be antagonistic.\nThey could be arguments\nfighting physical or verbal\nor Otherwise they\ncould be synergistic.\nThey could take on any\nnumber of different forms\ndepending on the motivations\nand the individuals that\nare involved.\nBut even though I\njust described this\nin fairly top contour,\nwhat I just described\nis actually the core\nelements of any story\nor any creative endeavor.\nIt's just that many stories are\nfrom the perspective of what\nwe already know and believe\nand think the world to be.\nAnd our own perspective\nand the actions\nthat we would take given that\nworld in that perspective.\nWhereas if we want\nto be creative,\nwe want to think outside\nof our usual framework\nand yet using elements\nthat exist within us\nno one has to tell us\nthe creative narrative.\nWe're trying to come\nup with it on our own.\nWe want to essentially\nthink in a childlike way\nhow do children think?\nWell, they have new\ndifferent or entirely novel\nconcepts about how\nthe world works.\nBut those are bounded.\nAnd this is a key word.\nThose are bounded.\nThey're not infinite.\nIt's not that\nanything can happen.\nSome kids will say, you can fly\nand you can shoot lasers out\nof your eyes, you\ncan do all things\nthat are unicorns or candy\nfalling from the sky.\nAt some point, if you don't\nbound the change in the world,\nit just becomes pure chaos and\neven children don't do that.\nSo we need to bound the\nchange and yet create\nsome alternate universe, if you\nwill, in which the story takes\nplace or the\ncreation of any kind,\ndoesn't have to be\na story takes place.\nThen there has to be\na perspective shift.\nAnd this is very useful.\nThis is actually a\ntool that we can all\nuse of trying to take\nthe perspective of others\nbut not just asking what they\nwould feel or think or do.\nBut ask what is their\nmotivation in life generally\nor what mood stance or goal\nstance are they taking.\nAre they trying to\nextract from others?\nAre they trying\nto give to others?\nAre they very altruistic,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAnd then you take\nthat individual\nand you do that also for\nanother individual or group\nof individuals\nand then you start\nthinking about how those\ndifferent individuals because\nof their different\nmotivational states\nwould engage at the\nlevel of action.\nWhat they would do,\nwhat they would say,\nwould they mate,\nwould they fight,\nwould they-- et\ncetera, et cetera.\nYou think of any story.\nThe story of Star Wars,\nof the Greek myths.\nYou think of any story that has\nbeen created, which we consider\ngreat and novel works.\nAnd you start to find these\nthree elements-- worldbuilding,\nperspective shifting, and\naction generating techniques.\nAnd so while this is, again,\njust a broad contour of what\nthis narrative\napproach involves,\nI think it's a very\nimportant and very exciting\none because it\ngives us a formula.\nWe already know that\ndivergent thinking\nand convergent thinking\nare both elements\nof the creative process.\nThis is suggesting\nthat whether or not\nit involves divergent\nthinking or not,\nthese authors seem\nto think this is\ndistinct from divergent\nthinking that capturing some\nof the elements of creativity\nthat are present in childhood\nbut that then tend to\ndisappear as we start\nto assume identity, build\nidentity, and understand rules\nabout the actual\nworld we live in.\nAll of those basic elements\nof early childhood creativity\ncan be reawakened.\nAnd, in fact, they have data\nto support the fact that they\ncan be reawakened in\nadults in meaningful ways\nthat can lead to new product\ndesign, new workplace\ninteractions, and on and on.\nThat I find very exciting.\nAnd as a consequence,\nI do intend\nto do an entire episode\nat some point on narrative\nand storytelling.\nAnd the role of narrative\nand storytelling\nnot just for sake of\ncreativity but also\nfor accessing neuroplasticity\nand for enhancing memory\nand so on.\nThere's an entire landscape of\nliterature and exciting tools\nand things to understand there.\nBut in the meantime, we will\nprovide a link to this paper.\nAnd for those of you that\nchoose not to access the paper,\nsimply understanding these\nthree aspects of narrative\nas an alternative to\naccessing creativity.\nThat is, a dedicated and well\nunderstood or established\nworld shift that you choose,\nperspective shifting and taking\non the motivation of\nothers, and creating\nsome landscape of exploration\nfor what interactions would\noccur between that individual\nor groups of individuals\nand other individuals that\nhave other motivations\nand yet are still living\nin this alternate world.\nThose three elements\nwe now know can\nbe combined into what\nyou or I or anyone\nwould consider important\ncreative works.\nSo today we\ndiscussed creativity.\nThis absolutely fascinating\naspect to human brain\nfunction that has allowed us as\na species to develop everything\nfrom great works\nof art and music\nto technological innovations\nthat allow us to fly and allow\nus to access people all over\nthe world through little screen\ndevices that we carry around\nin our pockets and on and on.\nAs I mentioned at the\nbeginning of today's episode,\nI find creativity to be one of\nthe most fascinating aspects\nof brain function.\nAnd in particular,\nbecause we don't actually\nknow what the upper\nlimits of creativity\nare and yet we understand\nthat there are certain bounds,\nthere are certain requirements.\nAnd the key requirement\nfor creativity\nis this aspect of utility.\nNow, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean\nthat for something to\nbe considered creative\nit has to be useful in\nthe practical sense,\nbut it does seem\nthat for something\nto be considered truly\ncreative or especially creative\nin some cases that\nit revealed to us\nsomething fundamental about the\nway that we or the world works.\nWe discuss some of the\nneural circuits that\nunderlie the different\naspects of creativity\nin particular divergent\nand convergent thinking\nas well as narrative building\nand some of the tools\nand steps that can allow\nus to better access\ndivergent thinking and\nconvergent thinking.\nAnd those tools include\nbehavioral tools as well as\npharmacology.\nAnd we talked about narrative\nbuilding as a way to reawaken\nor I should say, reaccess\nthe childhood creativity\nthat did indeed exist in all\nof us at some point in time.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe
