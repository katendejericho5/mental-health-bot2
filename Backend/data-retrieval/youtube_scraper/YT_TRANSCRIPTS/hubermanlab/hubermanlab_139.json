so\nof this episode and\nhopefully that will allow you\nto discern whether or not\nyou would like to become\na premium subscriber.\nWithout further ado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nAnd as always, I will strive\nto be as accurate as possible,\nas thorough as possible, and\nyet as concise as possible.\nThe first question is\nabout how to improve sleep.\nIn particular, how to improve deep sleep\nthat is sometimes called slow-wave sleep.\nThis was a question that\nwas asked by Jack Pritchard\nand they got a lot of up votes.\nNow, we've done multiple\nfull-length episodes\nof the Huberman Lab podcast on sleep\nand tools to improve sleep,\nincluding the Master Your Sleep episode\nand Perfect Your Sleep episode,\nas well as a toolkit that is available\ncompletely zero cost at hubermanlab.com.\nIt's a downloadable PDF that lists out\nthe behavioral tools and other tools\nthat you can implement\nto improve your sleep.\nNow Jack's question is specifically about\nhow to improve deep sleep.\nHe asks, I have a sleep\nanalyzer and I typically observe\nthat I get a lot of REM sleep,\nthat is rapid eye movement sleep.\nFor him, he says it's\n30% of his total sleep\nis rapid eye movement sleep.\nBut he asks, my deep sleep\nis often low, around 10%,\nand I would like to know if there\nare any science-backed protocols\nI can use to specifically\nincrease my deep sleep.\nOkay, so for those of\nyou that may not know\nwhat is deep sleep.\nNow, deep sleep is sometimes\nreferred to as slow-wave sleep,\nthat is slow-wave sleep and\ndeep sleep are sometimes used\ninterchangeably to\ndescribe the same thing.\nThey aren't necessarily the same thing,\nbut they fall under the\nsame mechanistic umbrella.\nWhat is that mechanistic umbrella?\nWell, when you go to sleep at night,\nyou cycle through a number\nof different stages of sleep.\nAnd in the early part of the night,\nI would say in the first\nhalf of your night or so,\nmost of your sleep is going\nto be slow-wave deep sleep.\nBut then as you transition\ninto the second half\nof your night, more of your sleep\nwill be rapid eye movement sleep.\nNow that's the typical pattern\nthat is observed when\nyou're not disrupting\nyour sleep architecture with things\nlike caffeine and alcohol.\nWe'll talk about caffeine\nand alcohol in a few minutes.\nDeep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep,\nat least for sake of this conversation,\nis vitally important in particular\nfor repair of bodily tissues.\nDuring deep sleep, you\nsecrete growth hormone\nand in fact you secrete\ngrowth hormone every night\nwhen you go to sleep.\nBut most of that growth hormone release\nis restricted to the first\nhalf of your sleep night.\nThe other feature of deep sleep\nis that the dreams that\noccur during deep sleep\ntend to be of a less emotional nature\nthan the sorts of dreams\nthat one experiences\nin rapid eye movement sleep.\nSo just to give a broad top\ncontour of what deep sleep,\naka slow-wave sleep is really about,\nit tends to occur in the\nfirst half of the night,\nit also occurs in the\nsecond half of the night,\nbut in the first half of the night,\nmost of your sleep is going\nto be occupied by deep sleep,\naka slow-wave sleep.\nIt is the time when your\nbodily tissues are repaired\nin part by release of growth hormone,\nwhich is involved in metabolism,\nbut also protein synthesis, muscle repair,\nrepair of all cell types and tissues.\nAnd during deep sleep,\nyour dreams tend to be somewhat mundane,\nsometimes a little bizarre,\nbut typically not very emotionally loaded.\nThat can change if you're dealing\nwith a lot of emotionally\nladen circumstances\nin your waking life, but in general,\nthe sleep and dreams that\noccur in the first part\nof the night is deep\nand it's not terribly emotionally ridden.\nYour body also goes through\nspecific patterns of metabolism.\nNow, this relates to recent\nfindings just this last year\nin which researchers monitored\nthe output of people's breath\nand the various metabolic\nfactors present in the breath\nas well as through blood draws,\nSo basically doing all this\nwhile people are asleep in a laboratory.\nAnd they observe that during\nthe first half of the night\nwhile people are in deep sleep,\ntheir body is actually metabolizing\nenergy very differently\nthan it does in the\nsecond half of the night.\nI'll come back to this in a little while,\nbut this turns out to be very important\nfor establishing your metabolism\nand the way you regulate\ninsulin and blood glucose\nduring the daytime.\nSo all of this is to say that\ngetting sufficient deep sleep,\nslow-wave sleep, is vitally important.\nAnd Jack's asking how he\ncan increase the amount\nof deep sleep that he's getting because\nby his sleep tracking method,\nhe's observing far less deep sleep\nthan rapid eye movement sleep.\nNow that raises the question\nof how much deep sleep\none should be getting overall.\nIn general, the goal should be to balance\nthe total amount of slow-wave sleep\nand rapid eye movement\nsleep across the night.\nHowever, I would not want people to obsess\nover getting exactly 30%\nrapid eye movement sleep\nand exactly 30% slow-wave sleep.\nYour body is much more\nresilient than that,\nbut the closer those two\nnumbers are to one another,\nthe better overall\narchitecture of your sleep.\nAnd he doesn't list out exactly\nhow he's measuring his sleep\nso I do want to put an\nasterisk on both the question\nand the answer I provide by stating\nthat a lot of sleep trackers,\nwhether or not they are\nWHOOP trackers or Ouras\nor whether or not you're\nusing a mattress based\nor mattress cover based sleep tracker\nlike Eight Sleep or other,\nis using heart rate and\nheart rate variability\nand body movement to estimate\nor to kind of predict whether or not\nyou're in slow-wave sleep\nor rapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd that's because during\nrapid eye movement sleep,\nyou tend to be in what's called atonia,\nyou tend to be paralyzed, you can't move.\nAnd during slow-wave\nsleep, that's not the case.\nBut no matter what the\nsleep tracking method is,\nif it's a standard commercial\nsleep tracking method,\nWHOOP or Eight Sleep, et cetera,\nit is an estimate or a best guess\nat what stage of sleep you're in.\nWhereas when you go\ninto a sleep laboratory,\nlike the sleep laboratory at Stanford,\nat University of Pennsylvania or other\nof the great sleep laboratories\nthat are out there,\nthey're going to use other methods\nincluding EEG and EMG.\nThese are just acronyms that refer to ways\nto record brainwaves.\nThey actually are going to try and observe\nfor rapid eye movements\nbeneath the eyelids, et cetera.\nSo sleep trackers give you a best guess\nas to what stage of sleep you're in.\nThey are not perfectly accurately,\nat least none of the\ncommercially available\nsleep trackers are perfectly accurate.\nSo we do want to highlight that.\nOkay, so now let's answer\nJack's question directly,\nwhich is how to increase the total amount\nof slow-wave sleep.\nWell, there are a couple ways.\nFirst of all are the don'ts\nand then we'll talk about the dos.\nTwo things that you can\ndo to really disrupt\nyour slow-wave sleep\nare to drink alcohol\nwithin eight hours prior\nto bedtime or even at all.\nSome people will find\nthat even if they have\na glass of wine or a beer with lunch,\nthat the amount of slow-wave sleep\nand sometimes even the\nrapid eye movement sleep\nthat they get at night is reduced\nand that their overall sleep\narchitecture is disrupted.\nThis has been shown again and again.\nLikewise, avoiding caffeine within eight\nand ideally within 12 hours of bedtime\nwould be preferable.\nAnd if you're not a caffeine drinker,\nobviously you don't have\nto worry about this at all,\nbut avoiding caffeine intake\nwithin that 8 to 12 hours\nof bedtime will greatly assist in you\ngetting more slow-wave sleep\nand higher quality rapid\neye movement sleep.\nThis has been shown again and again.\nAnd as well avoiding cannabis use\nand maybe even CBD use\nwithin 8 to 12 hours of sleep\ncan be very beneficial if your goal\nis to improve the quality of your sleep.\nNow, I know a lot of\npeople rely on alcohol,\ncannabis and CBD in\norder to get into sleep.\nHowever, it's been shown\nmany times in human studies,\nand this was discussed\nin the podcast episode\nthat we did with the great Matt Walker,\nwho's a professor of\nneuroscience and psychology\nat University of California, Berkeley,\nand a world expert in\nsleep and sleep science.\nMatt and I discussed the research showing\nthat even though alcohol\nhelps you fall asleep,\neven though cannabis can\nhelp you fall asleep,\nand even though CBD can\nhelp people fall asleep,\nthat it does disrupt\nand in many ways reduce\nthe quality of sleep that one gets.\nSo that's disappointing news I know\nfor a number of the people\nthat rely on cannabis,\nCBD, or alcohol to fall asleep,\nbut I would encourage you\nto check out the episodes\nof the Huberman Lab podcast that we did\nabout alcohol and about cannabis,\nincluding some of the\nhealth benefits of cannabis\nin certain situations,\nbut also some of the detrimental effects\nof both alcohol and\ncannabis in other situations\nin particular for\nimproving slow-wave sleep.\nSo that's actually three major don'ts.\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis,\nand let's put under the\numbrella of cannabis,\nTHC and CBD in the 8 and\nideally within the 12 hours\nprior to sleep if your goal is to improve\nthe total amount of slow-wave\nsleep that you're getting\nand your overall sleep architecture.\nIn addition,\nit's well known that avoiding food intake\nin the two hours prior to sleep\nis going to greatly assist in the amount\nof growth hormone output that you achieve\nduring the early stages of the night\nand the depth and duration\nof slow-wave sleep.\nNow, I want to place an\nasterisk on that statement\nby saying if you go to sleep too hungry,\nit can also disrupt your sleep.\nSo you're going to have to\narrange your eating schedule\nand your sleeping schedule such that\nyou're not eating too close to bedtime,\nbut you're also not going to bed so hungry\nthat you can't fall asleep\nor that you don't get\ninto deep sleep and stay asleep.\nI can personally attest to the fact\nthat if I'm too hungry,\nI can't fall asleep.\nNow for me, most nights\nI'm going to eat dinner\nsometime between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM\ndepending on time of year, schedules,\nwhat's going on, traffic, et cetera.\nAnd I tend to go to sleep\nsomewhere between 10:00 PM\nand 11:00 PM plus or minus an hour,\nagain, depending on time of year\nand what else is going on in life.\nSo I normally have that\nbuffer of two hours or so\nbefore going to sleep.\nHowever, there are some nights\nwhere even if I eat dinner around 7:00 PM,\nI'm quite hungry at 9:00 PM\nand I want to go to sleep.\nIn that case, eating a\nsmall amount of food,\nought not to disrupt your\nslow-wave sleep too much,\nbut you do want to\navoid eating large meals\nright before going to sleep unless,\nunless completely fasting\nand not eating something\nlate at night will\nprevent you from getting\ninto any sleep at all.\nIn other words, it's better to make sure\nthat you're getting to sleep\nthan it is to avoid food\njust so that you get\nincreased growth hormone output\nand into slow-wave sleep.\nI hope that's clear.\nYou know, I have had times in my life\nwhere I'm working very, very hard\nand I missed dinner or something comes up\nand I know some people can\nfall asleep quite easily\non an empty stomach.\nI've been able to do that,\nin particular if I'm very exhausted.\nI also rely on a handful of supplements\nto fall asleep each night,\nalthough I've not dependent on them.\nThere have been times when I\nhaven't been able to access\nthose supplements and I\ncan still fall asleep.\nBut the point is that you\ndon't want to be so hungry\nthat you can't fall asleep.\nAnd yet in an ideal circumstance,\nespecially if you're trying to increase\nthe amount of slow-wave sleep,\nyou would avoid food\nin the two hours or so\nbefore going to sleep.\nIf you can avoid food for\nthe three or four hours\nprior to sleep and still\nfall and stay asleep easily,\nthat's even better for sake\nof increasing slow-wave sleep\nand growth hormone output.\nNow, there are some additional tools\nfor improving slow-wave sleep,\nin particular, the transitions\nbetween slow-wave sleep\nand the other sleep stages\nbecause even though,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nthe early part of your\nnight is occupied primarily\nby slow-wave sleep, all night long\nyou're transitioning from slow-wave sleep\ninto an intermediate stage of sleep\nand then into rapid eye movement sleep\nand then back again.\nIt's just that in the\nearly part of the night,\nmore of that time is going to be occupied\nby slow-wave sleep.\nThe two ways to improve slow-wave sleep\nthat are well documented\nin the literature,\nand here we can point to\nsome really nice papers\nthat I'll reference in case\nyou want to read further,\nis the first one is entitled,\nExercise Improves the\nQuality of Slow-Wave Sleep\nby Increasing Slow-Wave Stability.\nSlow-wave Stability has to do with,\nas researchers call it,\nthe amount of power present\nin the different aspects\nof slow-wave sleep,\nSo this gets a little bit technical,\nbut this is an instance in\nwhich they brought subjects\ninto the laboratory, they\nmeasured brainwaves by EEG,\nthey had some other measurements as well\nincluded in subjective measures of sleep,\nand they looked at whether or not people\nwere doing exercise or not prior to sleep.\nNow, when I say prior to sleep,\nI mean not within six\nhours prior to bedtime.\nIn fact, exercising\nintensely in the six hours\nprior to bedtime, for\nmany people, not all,\nbut for many people can\ndisrupt the total amount\nof slow-wave sleep that they get\nand can also disrupt\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nSo the conditions of the study\nwere pretty straightforward.\nIt was a randomized crossover trial.\nBasically, they had people either sleeping\nand monitoring their sleep\nor they had people doing\nan hour of exercise at 60%\nof their so-called VO2\nmax, you can look this up,\nfor 60 minutes.\n60% of their VO2 max,\nthat was the intensity.\nIt's breathing pretty hard,\nbut not extremely hard.\nIf we were going to map\nthat to the so-called zone,\nzone 2 cardio being the kind of cardio\nyou can do steady state\nwhile holding a conversation.\nThis would be somewhere\nin the probably zone 3\nor zone 4, although that's not exactly\nwhat 60% of VO2 Max is\ngoing to map to every time.\nThink about relatively\nchallenging cardiovascular output\nfor 60 minutes, and they had them do that\nat least six hours prior to bedtime,\nand, this is an important and,\nThey did have the subjects in this study\nin all conditions abstain\nfrom caffeine and alcohol,\nso that's very important.\nAnd what they observed was an enhancement\nof slow-wave sleep.\nSo exercise of this sort turns out\nto be a very potent form of\nimproving slow-wave sleep.\nNow, I do not know, because the study\nas far as I know has not been done,\nwhether or not doing resistance training\nor some other type of exercise\nwould've led to the same effect,\nalthough I have to imagine\nthat if it's moderately intense\nto intense resistance training\nprovided it's done far enough\naway from going to sleep\nprior to six hours before sleep,\nthat one ought to see the same effects.\nAlthough that was not a\ncondition in this study.\nBut it's a very nice study.\nThey looked at everything from changes\nin core body temperature\nto caloric expenditure.\nThey didn't see huge changes in core body\ntemperature changes, so that\ncouldn't explain the effect.\nIt really appears that the major effect\nof improving slow-wave sleep was due\nto something in changing\nthe fine structure\nof the brain waves that\noccur during slow-wave sleep.\nIn fact, and this is an important point,\nthe subjects in this study\ndid not report subjectively\nfeeling that much better from their sleep.\nSo you might say, well then why\nwould I even want to bother?\nHowever, it's well known\nthat getting sufficient\nslow-wave sleep is important\nnot just for repair,\nexcuse me, for repair of bodily tissues,\nbut also for repair of brain tissues\nand repair and wash out\nof debris in the brain.\nAnd that debris is known to\nlead to things like dementia.\nSo getting the best\nquality slow-wave sleep\nis extremely important\nfor body and for brain.\nAnd getting an hour of exercise\nthat's moderately intense and making sure\nthat you're not doing that exercise\nwithin the six hours prior to bedtime,\nand avoiding caffeine and alcohol,\ncertainly within the six\nhours prior to bedtime,\nbut I would say in the 8 to 12 hours\nprior to bedtime would be even better\nor not drinking alcohol at all,\nor I know there are people out there\nthat don't drink caffeine at all,\nI'm not one of those people,\nbut restricting that caffeine intake to\nthe very early part of the day,\nthat has been shown to improve the quality\nand the overall architecture of sleep\nand slow-wave sleep in particular.\nThat's really what this study points to.\nThere's another tool that\ncan improve the amount\nand quality of slow-wave sleep\nthat you achieve at night.\nThis is actually a tool\nthat I've started using\nover the last six to eight months or so.\nAs many of you know,\nI believe in getting behaviors right\nbefore embracing changes\nin supplementation\nor prescription drugs.\nBehavioral tools consist\nof dos and don'ts,\nand the dos and don'ts for sleep\nare well documented in\nthe Master Sleep episode\nand the Perfect Your Sleep episode\nand the toolkit for sleep.\nThey include getting morning\nsunlight in your eyes\nor bright light of other kinds,\navoiding bright light\nfrom 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAll that information is\nin the toolkit for sleep\nand those other full-length episodes\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\nNow, there are supplements\nthat can greatly improve\nthe depth of your sleep\nand that can shorten the\nlatency to fall asleep.\nAnd here I'm not referring to melatonin,\nas many of you perhaps already know,\nI'm not a fan of melatonin\nfor a variety of reasons,\nmainly the fact that most\nmelatonin supplements out there\ndon't actually contain the\nexact amount of melatonin\nthat's listed on the bottle.\nThey contain either much,\nmuch more or much, much less.\nAnd that melatonin is a potent hormone\nthat has impacts on not just sleep,\nbut on other hormone systems as well.\nThe supplements that I've suggested\nand that I personally take\nin order to improve my sleep\nare magnesium threonate,\nspelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E.\nAnd interchangeably with that\none could use magnesium bisglycinate.\nI do consider those interchangeable\nbecause both cross into cells\nand cross the blood brain barrier\nin much the same way that\nmakes them better candidates\nfor improving sleep\nthan some of the other forms of magnesium.\nSo magnesium threonate,\ntheanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,\ntheanine, and something called apigenin,\nwhich is essentially\nwhat you find in camomile\nthat is the reason why\ncamomile can make you sleepy.\nA-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.\nThe dosages for those et cetera\nare described in the toolkit for sleep\nand why some people might\nwant to avoid theanine.\nI'll just tell you, for those of you\nthat have very intense\ndreams or that might\nsleepwalk or have night terrors,\nyou might want to avoid theanine\nbecause it can enhance\nthe kind of emotional\nand elaborate nature of dreams.\nOther people like that.\nSo I'll take magnesium\nthreonate, theanine, and apigenin\nas a so-called sleep stack\nabout 30 to 60 minutes\nprior to sleep.\nI do not take them during the day.\nThere is, however, another supplement\nthat used in combination\nwith the sleep stack\nthat I just described or alone\ncan greatly enhance the\nquality of your sleep.\nAnd in particular,\npeople who are following\na low carbohydrate diet\nwho have trouble falling\nand staying asleep seem\nto benefit from it,\nand that is so-called inositol.\nNow, inositol comes in different forms,\nbut the form that I'm referring to here\nin terms of enhancing slow-wave\nsleep is myo-inositol.\nThere are an enormous number\nof studies on inositol\nfor sake of mental health and for sake of\nenhancing various aspects\nof cellular function\nand for sake of improving sleep.\nI'd like to just highlight one paper,\ntitle of this paper will make\nit clear what it's about.\nThe title of the paper is\nThe Impact of Myo-Inositol\nSupplementation on Sleep\nQuality in Pregnant Women:\nA Randomized Double-Blind\nPlacebo Controlled Study.\nNow, as I just told you,\nthe study was carried\nout on pregnant women,\nbut there have been\nother studies of inositol\non other populations.\nAnd the major takeaway from these studies\nis that inositol can improve\nthe quality of sleep and\ncan adjust the architecture\nof sleep in ways that\nmake it a great candidate\nfor improving the structure\nand maybe also the duration\nof slow-wave sleep in particular.\nI find that if I'm following\na lower carbohydrate diet,\nwhich I do from time to time,\nI sometimes have trouble falling asleep.\nOr if I eat four to six\nhours prior to bedtime,\nthen I tend to be pretty\nhungry around bedtime.\nAnd sometimes if I'm exercising very hard\nor if I'm working a lot,\neven if I eat dinner around seven\nand I go to sleep around 10:00 PM,\nI might be a little bit\nhungry still at 10:00 PM.\nIn that case, I find that\ntaking 900 milligrams\nof myo-inositol in addition\nto the other sleep stack\nthat I just described\ngreatly enhances my ability\nto fall asleep and to get\nterrific quality sleep.\nI do monitor my sleep.\nI do that two ways.\nI do that these days with my\nEight Sleep sleep tracker,\nand I use a WHOOP sleep\ntracker when I sleep.\nThe combination of those two\ntaps into different\naspects of sleep tracking,\nheart rate variability,\nmovement, et cetera.\nIn a future episode, we'll talk about\nwhat are the best devices\nfor monitoring sleep,\nwhich have certain advantages\nand others have disadvantages.\nBut I certainly see it\nin the objective data\nthat is from the sleep tracking data.\nAnd I also observe subjectively\nthat taking 900 milligrams\nof inositol prior to sleep,\nagain 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep,\ncan greatly enhance the\nability to fall asleep\nand for me to stay asleep\nthroughout the night.\nI also noticed another effect,\nwhich is that if I wake up\nin the middle of the night\nto use the restroom, which I often do,\nI find it much easier to fall back asleep.\nI don't tend to get into\nkind of looping thought\nand things of that sort in\nthe middle of the night.\nAnd that may relate to\nthe fact that myo-inositol\nhas been studied in many cases\nfor its role in controlling anxiety\nthat is for reducing anxiety.\nAnd that's one of the reasons, in fact,\none of many reasons why\npeople take myo-inositol\nduring the daytime.\nThere are studies of myo-inositol\nfor dealing with anxiety, for\nsleep as we're discussing now,\nand even for improving fertility\nand things of that sort,\nin particular in women.\nSo again, 900 milligrams of an inositol\ncan be a useful tool.\n60 minutes of exercise,\nas described previously,\ncan be a tool, and\ncertainly avoiding caffeine\nand alcohol is an excellent tool\nfor enhancing the total\namount of slow-wave sleep.\nJack had a second part to his question,\nhe asked is having a high level\nof rapid eye movement sleep\nand a lower level of deep sleep\nlikely to cause any health issues?\nAnd to be honest, it's not really clear\nthat it would cause any\nspecific health issues,\nalthough if we think about\nwhat the specific roles\nof slow-wave sleep versus\nrapid eye movement sleep are,\nagain, rapid eye movement sleep\nbeing laden with highly emotional dreams,\nIt's thought to act as\na sort of trauma release\nwhere people are paralyzed in body\nand that's a healthy paralysis,\nthey're so-called sleep atonia,\nbut undergoing some pretty emotional stuff\nwithin their dreams,\nand there is a lack of\nability for the body\nto secrete adrenaline during\nrapid eye movement sleep,\nthat's thought to be important\nfor emotional repair, if you will,\nduring the night.\nCertainly studies where\npeople have been deprived\nof rapid eye movement sleep\nhave shown that their\nability to manage emotionally\nduring the daytime is reduced.\nCertainly if you have reduced\nrapid eye movement sleep\nfor multiple nights, that's\ngoing to be the case.\nThe only caveat to that is\nthat there are certain forms\nof treating depression that involve\nspecifically depriving people\nof rapid eye movement sleep.\nThat's a whole other\nstory that was covered\nin the podcast episode\nwith Dr. Nolan Williams.\nSo if you want to learn more\nas to why that's the case,\ncheck out that episode.\nBut because slow-waves sleep,\nwhich occurs again during\nthe early part of the night,\nis when growth hormones is released\nand when there's this periodic washout\nof debris within the brain,\nand to some extent within\ncertain tissues of the body,\nyou could imagine that\nreduced low-wave sleep\nwould lead to reduced ability\nto recover from exercise,\nfrom injury, maybe even\nrelate to the immune system.\nHowever, I am personally\nnot aware of any studies\nthat specifically looked at the ratio\nof slow-wave sleep to\nrapid eye movement sleep,\nand that focused in particular\non reduced slow-wave sleep\nfor bodily repair.\nThose studies might be out there,\nI was not able to find them.\nIf you are able to find them,\nplease put them in the comment section\nand I would love to\ncheck out those studies.\nSo I don't think that one\nneeds to be overly concerned\nif you're not getting a\nbalance of slow-wave sleep\nto rapid eye movement\nsleep, that's perfect.\nHowever, and as I mentioned earlier,\nit would be good to\nstrive to try and balance\nthe amount of slow-wave sleep\nand rapid eye movement sleep\nacross the entire night.\nIf you think about it,\nthat will also tell you whether or not\nyou're getting sufficient total sleep.\nAnd I don't want to open up\nanother set of questions here\nas I'm about to close out\nan answer to this question,\nbut I do often get asked the question\nwhether or not four hours is enough,\nor six hours is enough,\nor eight hours is enough.\nWell, it's impossible to know exactly\nhow much sleep each\nindividual person needs.\nAnd of course, each individual person\nwill need a different\namount of total sleep\ndepending on the amount of stress\nand physical strain and\nvarious other things\nthey're dealing with in\ntheir daily waking life.\nHowever, it's generally the case\nthat kids and people that\nare undergoing puberty\nand certainly in early infancy\nneed more sleep than adults do.\nSo as you age, you do\nin fact need less sleep.\nOne good metric of whether\nor not you are getting enough sleep\nis whether or not you're sleepy\nduring the daytime or not.\nIf you're falling asleep\na lot during the daytime,\nyou're probably not getting\nenough sleep at night.\nThat's sort of a duh,\nbut it's an important\nduh to pay attention to.\nAnd for those of us, like myself,\nthat need a 20 or 30 minute\nnap in the afternoon, great.\nThat doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're not getting enough sleep at night.\nSo if you get sleepy enough to\nwant a nap in the afternoon,\nthat's not an indication necessarily\nthat you are not getting\nenough sleep at night.\nHowever, if you're only sleeping four\nor five hours per night,\nit's very hard to imagine\nthat you're getting\na balance of slow-wave sleep\nand rapid eye movement sleep.\nOnce you get into the range\nof sleeping six to eight hours\nand certainly 8 to 10 hours per night,\nthe probability that\nyou're getting a balance\nof slow-wave sleep and\nrapid eye movement sleep\ngreatly increases.\nSo if I were to throw out a number,\nI would say for most people,\nthat is for 95% of people out there,\ngetting at least six hours\nof sleep per night, at least,\nand ideally more like seven or eight\nis going to be the goal.\nHowever, I've noticed,\nfor instance, for myself,\nunless I'm exercising extremely intensely\nor I'm going through a lot of emotional\nor physical stress in my daily life,\ngetting six and a half to\nseven hours of sleep per night\nallows me to feel really good\nand refreshed throughout the day.\nAnd that's especially the case if I get\nthat 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon\nor use NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest.\nSo I hope that answers\nyour question, Jack,\nand there are, of course,\nI'm extending the answer to all others\nwho upvoted that question\nor who might be interested in improving\ntheir slow-wave sleep.\nThere are some dos, there are some don'ts\nthat I just described.\nI suggest trying various things one by one\nto see what works best for you\nso you don't necessarily need to leap\nto doing the 60 minutes of exercise\nplus the inositol, et cetera.\nHowever, I do encourage\neveryone to avoid alcohol\nand caffeine within the 8\nto 12 hours prior to sleep.\nAnd again, if you're not\nusing either of those,\nthat would be even better,\nat least in terms of sleep architecture.\nThank you for joining for the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode\nand to hear future episodes\nof these Ask Me Anything Sessions\nplus to receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the\nHuberman Lab podcast\nstandard channel and Premium Tools\nnot released anywhere else,\nplease go to hubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we launched\nthe Huberman Lab podcast premium Channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's to raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel,\nwhich of course will still be continued\nto be released every\nMonday in full length.\nWe are not going to change\nthe format or anything\nabout the standard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research, in particular,\nresearch done on human beings,\nso not animal models, but on human beings,\nwhich I think we all agree is a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund research\nthat is aimed toward\ndeveloping further protocols\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAnd those protocols will be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nSo the idea here is to\ngive you information\nto your burning questions in depth\nand allow you the opportunity to support\nthe kind of research that\nprovides those kinds of answers\nin the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting feature\nof the Premium channel is\nthat the Tiny Foundation\nhas generously offered to\ndo a dollar for dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific way\nthat they're going to amplify\nwhatever funds come in\nthrough the premium channel\nto further support research\nfor science and science-related\ntools for mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up\nfor the Huberman Lab premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost of $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 upfront\nfor the entire year.\nThat will give you access to all the AMAs,\nyou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,\nand you'll of course get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium content\nsuch as transcripts of the AMAs\nand various transcripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast episodes\nnot found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be supporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the premium channel\nby going to hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
