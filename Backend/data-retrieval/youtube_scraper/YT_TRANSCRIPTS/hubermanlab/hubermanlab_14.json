    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Diego\nborquez Dr Diego borquez is a professor\nof medicine and neurobiology at Duke\nUniversity he did his training in\ngastrointestinal physiology and\nnutrition and later neuroscience and by\ncombining that unique training and EXP\nexpertise he is considered a Pioneer and\nleader in so-called gut sensing or the\ngut brain axis now when most people hear\nthe words gut brain axis they\nimmediately think of the so-called\nmicrobiome which is extremely important\nbut that is not the topic of Dr borquez\nexpertise Dr borz focuses on the actual\nsensing that occurs within one's gut\njust as one would sense light with their\neyes or sound waves with their ears for\nhearing our gut contains receptors that\nrespond to specific components of food\nincluding amino acids fats sugars and\nother aspects of food including\ntemperature acidity and other\nmicronutrients that are contained in\nfood that give our gut the clear picture\nof what is happening at the level of the\ntypes and qualities of food that we\ningest and then communicate that below\nour conscious detection to our brain in\norder to drive specific patterns of\nthinking emotion and behavior and of\ncourse everybody has heard of our\nso-called gut sense or our ability to\nbelieve or feel certain things based on\nperceptions that are below or somehow\ndifferent from conventional language\ntoday Dr borquez teaches us about all\naspects of gut sensing how it occurs at\nthe level of specific neurons and neural\ncircuits how the brain responds to that\nhow specific foods and components of\nfood impact not just our feeling of\ndigestion or feeling good or bad about\nwhat we ate but indeed how we feel\noverall how safe we feel how excited we\nfeel whether or not we feel depressed or\nsad angry or happy today's discussion I\npromise you is unique among all\ndiscussions of neuroscience at least\nthat I've heard previously in that it\ncombines two seemingly disparate Fields\nnutrition and Neuroscience indeed\ntoday's discussion gets into how\ndifferent foods and food combinations\nimpact how we feel and what We crave and\nwhat we tend to avoid we also get to\nhear the absolutely extraordinary story\nof Dr borz upbringing in the Amazon\njungle and how his knowledge and\nintuition about plants has influenced\nHis science and how the incredible\nscience that his laboratory is doing\nrelates to all of us and our ability to\nbetter tap into our gut sense before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is ju\njuv makes medical grade red light\ntherapy devices now if there's one thing\nthat I've consistently emphasized on\nthis podcast it's the incredible impact\nthat light meaning photons can have on\nour mental health and physical health\nred and near infrared light has been\nshown to have profound effects on\nimproving Cellar Health which can help\nwith faster Muscle Recovery boosting\nhealthier skin reducing pain and\ninflammation enhancing sleep and much\nmore what sets juv apart is that it uses\nclinically effective wavelengths emits a\nsafe and effective dose of red and near\ninfrared light and most importantly\noffers the only true Medical grade Red\nLight Panel available I personally try\nto use the handheld ju go unit as it's\ncalled every day and especially when I'm\non the road traveling if

correct amounts and\nratios and nothing you don't which means\nno sugar now ion others on this podcast\nhave talked about the critical\nimportance of hydration for proper brain\nand body functioning even a slight\ndegree of dehydration can diminish\ncognitive and physical performance it's\nalso important that you get adequate\nelectrolytes the electrolytes sodium\nmagnesium and pottassium are critical\nfor the functioning of all the cells in\nyour body especially your neurons your\nnerve cells drinking element dissolved\nin water makes it very easy to ensure\nthat you're getting adequate hydration\nand adequate electrolytes to make sure\nI'm getting proper amounts of hydration\nand electrolytes I dissolve one packet\nof element in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I'll also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\nin hot days when I'm sweating a lot\nlosing water and electrolytes they have\na bunch of different great tasting\nflavors of element my favorite is the\nwatermelon although I confess I also\nlike the raspberry and the Citrus\nbasically I like all the flavors and\nelement has also just released a new\nline of canned sparkling element so\nthese aren't the packets you dissolve in\nwater these are cans of element that you\ncrack open like any other canned drink\nlike a soda but you're getting your\nhydration and your electrolytes with no\nsugar if you'd like to try element you\ncan go to drink element spelled

borz Dr Diego\nborquez great to have you here thank you\nfor uh having me\nAndrew I am super excited to learn from\nyou today as I know everyone else is and\nif they don't realize why soon they will\nwhich is that you work on one of the\nmore fascinating aspects of us which is\nour gut our gut\nsensing the gut brain axis which I think\nmost people don't realize is nearby but\nseparate from the so-called\nmicrobiome so we're not talking about\nthe microbiome a very interesting and\nimportant topic of\ncourse but we are going to talk about\nthis thing that we call our gut sense\nand how it impacts everything from our\nCravings to our brain health and our\ncognition\nso once again welcome and I'll just want\nto kick things off by asking you to\neducate us explain you know what is this\ngut brain axis that we hear about and\nwhat's going on in our gut besides\ndigestion well uh Andrew thank you so\nmuch for having me here uh thrilled to\nbe here I knew that since we met a few\nyears ago uh that we will have this\nongoing conversation and a great\nconversation um the gut and the Brain\nyou know people call it an axis because\ntraditionally thought to be an IM\nimaginary line that was connected\nthrough hormones so since 1902 when uh\nthe first hormone secretion was uh a\nreported by Bailey and Sterling uh\num it was known that uh when we eat then\nhormones these molecules in the gut are\nreleased and then they will enter the\nbloodstream and then eventually will\nhave a cause in distant\norgans uh and for the next 100 or so\nyears the the the the field focus on the\non the hormones and as a consequence\nthere was no direct line of\ncommunication between the gut and the\nBrain but as often I I say you don't you\ndon't say or we don't say the nose brain\naxis right like or the eye brain axis\nright uh and all of the organs are in\nsync working in sync so H in the gut\nthere are also some sensory cells that\nare able to detect the outside world\nER and then quickly communicate that\ninformation to the brain and I say the\noutside world because the gut is the\nonly organ that passes throughout our\nbody but it is still exposed to the\noutside if you think about it uh if you\nwill swallow a marble it still has the\nchance to get out um please don't do\nthat\nanybody but uh but is still exposed to\nthe surface you're right I never thought\nabout the gut as the organ that is in\ncontact with the outside world unlike\nour heart which is not in direct contact\nwith the outside world or our liver or\nour pancreas but the gut is the gut is\nuh and if you think about it it's just\nseparated by uh some compartments that\nhave all of these VVS you the epiglottis\nthe uh gastropa gel Junction the pylorus\nThe ilocal Junction the rectum so these\nare the the sequences of valves of\nChambers with valves between them that\nfood passes through air passes through\nand within each as I understand it there\nare different functions related to\ndigestion but I think where you're\ntaking us is that there are different\nmodes of sensing what's coming through\nand signaling to the brain and other\norgans what's going on in the outside\nworld by what's sensed coming through\nthat passage is that correct that's\ncorrect and uh if we think about it uh\num\nthe when we swallow something literally\nwe have to trust our gut perhaps that's\nwhy we use this phrase trust your gut\nright because after that there's not\nmuch that you can do at least in uh\nregular humans that you can do\nconsciously\nto uh expel something that perhaps is\npoisonous or toxic right um it is the\ngut that has to make that distinction\nand then usually accommodate things for\nabortion or let them pass uh through\ndigestion and then ultimately they will\nbe secreted right so if you could\ndescribe for us the architecture that is\nthe cells that respond to things in the\ngut and where they send that information\nand how they send that information what\nwhat is this thing that we call Gut\nsensing made up of what what's the parts\nlist so the parts uh list uh has been\nevolving recently\nand while some of the elements we have\nknown for for a while uh but in in\ngeneral what we're talking about because\nis an external surface it is lined by a\nsingle layer of cells that are called\nepithelial cells and essentially these\ncells are exposed to the outside world\nbut they also are like attached in like\na little membrane and they are the ones\nthat interface with the inside of the\nbody so in the stomach we have an try\ntoi a epithelium for instance that is uh\nthicker so it can survive digestion\nchemicals and other things like harsh\nenvironment and in the intestine we have\na little bit more of a um uh more\ndelicate uh epithelia layer and within\nthis epithelia layer there are several\ndifferent cell types and one of those is\nthe so-called enteroendocrine cell to\nput it in more simple terms is a gut\nendocrine cell or a gut cell that\nreleases hormones the term was coined in\n1938 by a German uh physician uh his\nname was Frederick\nfer and at that time it was a major\nadvancement in our understanding of\nphysiology because he came up with the\nidea that the organs were not only\ncommunicating to organs in fact there\nwere cells within the organs that were\ncommunicating to other organs through\nthe release of some of these endocrine\nfactors these neuromodulators or these\nneuropep that we know as hormones and uh\nso he named uh the diffus endocrine\nsystem of the gut and then he came up\nwith his word enteroendocrine cell and\nthese cells are dispar at a ratio of\nroughly speaking like 1 to 1,000\nepithelial uh cells throughout the\ndigestive\ntract and we thought for the longest\ntime that these cells were not\nconnecting directly to the nervous\nsystem that they will release these\nneuromodulators and the neuromodulators\nthrough diffusion will act on receptors\ninto some of the nerve Terminals and\nthat is true that is a very well\nestablished uh system uh but in 2015 we\nmade an observation that some of these\ncells anywhere from 1/3 to 2/3 of these\ncells it depends on like the type of a\nsystems that you use to identify they\nwere contacting directly the nervous\nsystem and that brought up a a a new\ndimension of how it is that the gut\ncould be could be communicating to the\nbrain because as you know in the brain\nthe synapses are the ones that are most\npredominant however there there is a lot\nof neurom modulation from endocrine uh\nfunctions in the brain too so in the gut\nuh this was not well described there had\nbeen historically uh a few examples that\nthese cells may be making synaptic\ncontacts but they had not been\nstudied and perhaps one of the main\nreasons why they hadn't being studied is\nbecause the the tools were not there and\nif you recall in in the um in 1990s uh\nwith the advancement of green\nfluorescence protein as uh one of the\nmain uh molecules to tag cells now all\nof a sudden there was a revolution in\nbiology because you could identify the\ncells you can take them out you can do a\na transcriptomic analysis to see what\ngenes they express uh you could\nco-culture them you can modify their\ngenome and then you can start to\ninterrogate what is their contribution\nto the entire body I'll just interrupt\nyou for a second just to make sure that\nI never else is on board so if I\nunderstand\ncorrectly it's long been known that\nthere are cells that are in these layers\nof the gut in the intestine and it's\nlong been appreciated that as food\npasses through these cells somehow can\nsense the chemical constituents of the\nof the food as it gets broken down and\nthen release hormones into the\nbloodstream that could influence the\nbrain those hormones could travel and\ninfluence things far away in fact um for\nthose that don't know endocrine\ngenerally mean signaling at a distance\nbetween cells so between gut and brain\nor gut and liver it can also mean local\neffects so uh hormones endocrine effects\ncan also be local\nbut if I also understand you correctly\nit was only about 15 years ago when you\nmentioned green fluorescent protein we\nshould probably just tell the Tale in a\nfew sentences this is an amazing story\nin biology where if you've ever seen\nfluorescing\njellyfish that's because they express a\ngene for so called Green fluorescent\nprotein and biologists have hijacked\nthat Gene sequence and put it into mice\nand now actually other organisms as well\nwhich allows you to see individual cells\nand cell types so these cells release\nhormones the hormones influence the\nbrain and other organs and now I think\nyou're going to tell us that they also\nare able to make direct communication\nlines with other organs as well\ncorrect uh so maybe here is feeling how\nit is that I I got into a starting the\nsystem and uh as you know between the\n90s and the early 2000s there was an\nexplosion in tools to study uh the brain\nand neural circuitry and the connection\nof neurons and each one of the neurons\nbecause up until the 1980s um the the\ntools were were limited\nelectrophysiology you know\nBehavior Uh but then not only we had a\ngreen fluorescence protein we we had\noptogenetics\nwe had uh a rabies modified to be able\nto\ntrace how it is the the neurons connect\nat one synapse which was a it was a\ndream I think that in fact that was the\ndream of Francis Creek when he was at\nthe Suk he he talked about that having\nthe way to control for those who don't\nknow Crick one uh was a co-recipient to\nthe Nobel Prize for the discovery of the\nstructured DNA but then later in his\ncareer developed an obsession for\nneuroscience and yeah he daydreamed out\nloud about having tools to visualize\nindividual Connections in the nervous\nsystem and as uh Diego is pointing out\nscientists have hijacked the rabies\nvirus which hops between neurons labeled\nthe rabies virus with Things That Glow\nfluorescent and in doing so we now\nunderstand a lot about what Crick\ndreamed for which was the ability to see\ndifferent specific Connections in the\nnervous system yes uh so then you could\nisolate the cells and then you could do\nsequencing technology to see like what\nare the genes that the cells are\nexpressing and then you can start to\nunderstand the makeup of the cells uh in\n2009 uh h cers a scientist u in the\nNetherlands uh did a beautiful\nexperiment like he he discovered these\nfactors that will trigger a receptor of\nthe stem cells in the intestinal\nepithelium and will form literally a\nmini gut in a in a dish you know these\ncells will be all lined up and then they\nwill have alumin and I remember like\nseeing some of these papers coming out\nuh when I was a PhD student and and I\nwas already studying the gut so it was\ninspiring to see like all of the things\nthat all of a sudden you could do right\nso when I began studying the cells um\nimmediately by isolating the cells and\nsimply observing the cells in the native\ntissue of these um m\nmodels it quickly became evident that\nsome of the cells had a very peculiar\nAnatomy uh some of them had these very\nprominent arms at the base like like\nliterally like um in the 16 Chapel uh\nAdam reaching out to to God right like\nwith a hand uh the cells will have that\ntype of anatomical H features and even\nending with a little hand at the end of\nthat arm uh and obviously I I\nimmediately thought like why would a\ncell that it is supposed to react to\nfood and release hormones into the\nbloodstream or just in the vicinity will\ninvest so much energy into developing an\narm right so then I started to look well\nperhaps it is because it's providing a\nbridge directly into the vasculature\ninto the vessels to put the the hormones\ninto the bloodstream right uh grown you\nknow like a I couldn't find that that\ndirect connection uh so then I started\nto study perhaps they were associated\nwith nervous system and that's how uh we\nmade some of the first observations that\nsome of them uh with the arm uh or\nwithout the arm they will have a more\nintimate\nrelationship with nerve\nfibers and that of course open up um a\nbunch of new\nquestions and but the first things that\nthe first thing that we had to do it was\nto come up with a name for this foot and\nit kind of became organic and I want to\nhighlight this because I think that as\nwe go through the discovery uh\ntrajectory we don't realize the need to\nalso engineer\nlanguage how we go about language is we\nstart to attach a words that we already\nknew and we start to put them together\nto describe something that new that\nwe're observing right and I say this\nbecause at the very beginning uh with my\nmentor we will start to call these\nlittle feet first we call them axon\nwhich is like uh the for like the long\nextending branches of the neurons the\nmain branches of the neurons so we will\ncall them axon like because they look\nlike a a baby\naxon but then we called them also like\nPudo po because it was like a pot but it\nwas\nPudo uh and at some point we and it was\ncoming from like some cells in the in\nthe kidneys that they are called uh po\npodia or something like that so it was\naxon like pseudo like basal process to\ndescribe that it was on the base so at\nsome point it became so long that we\ncouldn't fit it in an abstract right so\na bit of a mouthful so we began thinking\nabout it and then eventually I came up\nwith a term I thought like ah\nneurot um and I remember pitching it to\nmy mentor and I said like let me let me\nthink about the weekend and then on the\non a Monday he came in and he said like\nyou know it has a ring to it I think\nthat we should use it but but\nessentially the the the thought was that\nif these cells are contacting then\nperhaps they are passing information\ndirectly onto the nervous system and\nthat is very different than just\nspewing a\nneuromodulators in the vicinity and\nhoping that some of those catch the\nnervous system right and like I said\nwhile that is still exist and I think\nthat is just like matter of space and\ntime like they they modulate these\nterminals in a different space and time\nthe hormones but the transmission uh the\nneurotransmission is directly and more\nprecise in space and time could I just\num interrupt for a moment please so\nhormone signaling endocrine signaling\ngenerally is slower than the forms of\ncommunication directly between neurons\nright um could be on the order of\nseconds sure but typically on the orders\nof minutes or hours uh whereas neural\ncommunication on the order of\nmilliseconds correct so if I understand\ncorrectly these what you decide to\ncalled neurop pod cells and thank you\nfor shortening the name um from the\nother description um line the gut are we\ntalking about everything from esophagus\ndown to the stomach to the intestine or\nis it just at the level of the stomach\nand intestine where where do they this\nis uh this is where the conversation\nbecomes expansive because uh these\nneopods or cins of these neurop pods so\nthese neurop pods are simply a\nspecialized neuro epithelial cells\nmeaning that are electrically excitable\nthat they can discharge electricity but\nthey are this type of cells are in every\nsingle epithelial cell epithelial layer\nof the body because that's how the body\ncreates a representation of the world\nthrough sensor cells that are equipped\nto detect the outside world meaning that\nthey can be exposed to fluctuations in\ntemperature fluctuations in PH\nfluctuations in concentrations and then\nthey quickly can generate a chemo\nelectrical coat that they pass it onto\nthe nervous system and then ultimately\nthe brain integrates that and says like\noh my belly is feeling good but I'm\nfeeling cold in the skin right and that\nis thanks to all of these\nneuroepithelial cells that they are even\nin um tasting so to speak the uh the\nseru spinal fluid inside of the spinal\ncord and the ventricles they are inside\nof the the inner ears The Taste uh The\nTaste SPS so it is and in fact there's a\nbeautiful book from the 70s uh from some\nJapanese scientists uh fuet Canon\nKobayashi who uh called the cells Paran\nneurons and their whole concept is that\nthere was not such a discrete\ndistinction between an entire a neuron\nthat lives inside of the brain or the\ncentral nervous system and a A\nneuroepithelial or a neuroendocrine cell\nthat leaves exposed to the outside\nsimply that there is a continuum of\nadaptation so the the organism can bring\nthe information from outside inside into\nthe uh body to be able to process it and\nthen process it and then guide Behavior\nSo based on the way you describe it we\nhave these neurop pod cells that line\nour gut and we also have these similar\ncell types in the other organs of the\nbody and these cells are responding to\nthe chemical constituents of what we eat\nas the food is broken down\nalso to the temperature of the\nenvironment to the\npH the that is how relatively basic or\nacidic something is that we ate and\npresumably to other features in our\nenvironment as well and all of that\ninformation is activating these cells to\nsome degree or another and then we're\nreleasing hormones into our body as a\nconsequence but also there's a direct\nline to the brain and we're not\nnecessarily aware of all of this\nhappening right I mean until you\ndescribe it I think most of us are have\nnot been aware that this is happening\nand we probably shouldn't be aware you\nknow like as I often say like um if you\nand I are having a conversation we\nprobably shouldn't be aware of the\nmacras and the spleen that is chasing\nthis bacterium that got inside of the\nlettuce that we swallowed in at launch\nright like just do your thing so we can\nkeep communicating right except maybe\ndon't eat more of that lettuce right\nwhich is\nthe okay so you discovered these\nneuropodial to selectively label them\nwhat did that reveal about their\nconnectivity with you're referring to it\nas the nervous system which I love\nbecause a resounding theme on this\npodcast as I always say you know brain\nand spinal cord and all the connections\nto the body and back again is the\nnervous system but what what did you\ndiscover in terms of the connections\nwith the brain proper here is where the\ntools started to make a a big difference\nyou know all of the sudden you could see\nthe resolution of a receptor inside of a\ncell using certain type of microscopes\nright so I remember that one of the\nfirst questions that I will always get\ndrill on you know how these uh laugh\nmeetings can get intense right like when\nI will bring data and showing just very\nsimple um imunohistochemistry meaning\nlabeling to see how the cells were\ninteracting with uh the nervous\nsystem um as and I will show some of the\nimages then uh the other scientists will\nsay well you know yeah those are nice\nimages but remember that contact does\nnot mean connection you know and I went\nthinking about that like at the very\nbeginning I thought that it was silly\nsemantics you know um but I I\nspecifically remember that there was one\ntime I was running and I was thinking\nlike how do you demonstrate connection\nbetween two cells and then I thought\nthat since we had the ability to\nidentify the cells by fluorescence we\ncould isolate them based on their\nfluorescence and what will happen if we\nput them in front of a sensory neuron\nand then just record them inside of a\nmicroscope right over\ntime and I thought maybe they will get\nclose to each other and then we can go\nand do some more labeling and show that\nthey are H contacting or connecting but\nmuch to our surprise we actually saw\nthat in real time they when you isolate\nthem from the mouth and you put them in\na dish they both look like these round\ncircles but after a few hours not only\nthey get close to each other but they\nrecapitulate the circuitry in the dish\nliterally they form like two brains in a\ndish right like it's the gut and the\nBrain in a dish amazing uh yeah and that\nthat was an eye opener you know I still\nremember it was somewhere I think it was\nlike June 27 2012 when I saw that\nexperiment because um it opened my my\neyes to so many different things one was\nthat this cells are not\nstatic because since we have been seeing\nthem for decades just in as slices or\nfixed tissue and we have lost the notion\nthat this thing is constantly moving\nright the cells are actually moving the\ncells are actually moving so these cells\nline the gut meaning they're along the\nwalls of the gut an intestine yeah the\nintestine they reach a hand into the gut\nto sense whatever chemicals are there\nyeah they have Little Celia little hair\nor micr that is literally like little\nhair that is exposed to the Lumen M you\nknow so the Lumen folks is the the\ncavity the empty cavity of the gut not\nempty but you know the the the internal\npart and so they're sensing the\nchemicals there and you're saying they\ncan move okay and they're sending a\nprocess by the way folks anytime you\ndon't know whether or not something is a\ndendrite or an axon just call it a\nprocess you you'll get it right uh a\nprocess up to the brain underneath that\nwill connect to the nervous system I see\nso through a series of of of stations\nyeah okay um amazing so what we're\ntalking about here is Diego's discovery\nof a pathway from the gut to the brain\nthat essentially allows sensing of\nwhat's happening in the gut to inform\nfeelings decision correct yeah so that\nthat was uh the first experiment like\nshowing H in addition right the next\nexperiment was well does it happen in\nthe in the mouse and then through a\nseries of I have a friend neuroscientist\nthat she calls this Ravis gymnastics\nbecause you have to put in some genes\nand make things work then we\ndemonstrated that these uh\ncells that the virus will be capable of\ninfecting these cells specifically\ninstead of infecting the other\nepithelial cells it will infect these\nnew epithelial cells because ravies\nlikes\nneurons and then it will jump from that\ncell into a nerve\nfiber and these ravies can only jump one\nconnection right and what it was uh\nsurprising is that the fluoresence from\nthat rabies will show up in the brain\nstem and in the bodies of the cells that\nare in the noos ganglia which is this\ncluster where the cell bodies of the um\nneurons of the begos nerve are located\nright underneath the the\nneck meaning that there was just one\nstop between the surface of the\nintestine\nand the brain stem the two cells were\nconnecting that\num that space you know so obviously the\ninformation that was the anatomical\nbasis for the information to travel very\nrapidly up into the brain and rapidly in\nthe subconscious right like we're not\nnecessarily aware of it although uh I've\nread that there are some instances in\nwhich people become more aware of it\neither in uh a ag\ntypical uh fashion or with meditation\nand other things that people can become\naware yes people definitely can become\nmore aware of their so-called\ninteroception what's going on at the\nlevel of their heartbeat frequency or\ntheir gut sensing if they spend time on\nit some people as you mentioned develop\nan almost pathologic sense of\ninterception such that they have trouble\nnavigating normal life because they're\nso aware of what's going on inside their\nbody this is actually an interesting\nissue in the field of Psychiatry my\ncolleagues in Psychiatry at Stanford\ntell me that um some people with a lot\nof anxiety for instance are so aware of\ntheir heartbeat that it becomes um\ndisruptive and distracting to them so\nit's not always the case that it's\nbetter to become more aware of your\ninternal processing sometimes it can be\num dilus other times it can be good for\nus um some people are very unaware of\nwhat's happening in their body and they\nneed to develop more awareness of that I\nfeel like as long as we're talking about\nrabies we should have a little bit of\nfun and explain to people something\nabout rabies viruses because what we've\nbeen talking about is the use of viruses\nas uh experimental Tools in order to you\nknow take a\nvirus basically attach or put something\nin so that whatever cell is infected by\nit glows a certain color so you can see\nthe cells and visualize the circuitry\nbut as long as we're talking about\nrabies I feel like it's such a uh a word\nthat has such salience the rabies virus\nwhich exists in nature um is amazing\nbecause it's um I don't know if it has a\nConsciousness but it essentially\npropagates between animals by way of the\nanimals that have it bite they they\nbecome more\naggressive they bite a um a Target\nanimal the virus gets in it's picked up\nby the nerve Terminals and is carried\nback from one ner cell to the next\nacross synaptic connections right\nsynapses the G little gaps between\nneurons and what Dr Diego Boris has been\ntelling us is that scientists have\nengineered the rabies virus so that it\nonly jumps one station and then stops\nyou can do this by modifying the coat\nprotein there's a bunch of fun virology\nthat can be done uh to do that but what\nI find amazing about rabies virus and\nthere's a great book by the way called\nrabid which is a a essentially a history\nof the of the study of rabies um is that\nonce it travels from the S of the bite\nup to the brain what does it do it\nchanges the brain to make the now\ninfected animal or person more\naggressive so that then they go bite\nsomebody else um so I mean in some ways\nthat the viruses have a sort kind of\nunconscious genius to them right what's\nthe best way to get from one animal to\nthe next well there are a number of\ndifferent ways but one way is to just\nmake that animal more aggressive so it\ngoes and bites things yeah make wild\nmake the animal work for you right make\nthe animal work for you right it's it's\nit's almost exploitive right it exploits\ncertain circuit in the nervous system\nI'd like to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most\nof you have heard me tell my story about\nhow I've been taking ag1 once or twice a\nday every day since 2012 and indeed\nthat's true I started taking ag1 and I\nstill take ag1 once or twice a day\nbecause it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients are\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed are minimally processed\nWhole Foods it's often hard to do so\nespecially when I'm traveling and\nespecially when I'm busy so by drinking\na packet of ag1 in the morning and\noftentimes also again in the afternoon\nor evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting\neverything I need I'm covering all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nregularly just report feeling better and\nthat shouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ process\nCES that all interact with one another\nso while certain supplements are really\ndirected towards one specific outcome\nlike sleeping better or being more alert\nag1 really is foundational nutritional\nsupport it's really designed to support\nall of the systems of your brain and\nbody that relate to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink ag1 /h huberman okay\nso you uh identified these you said\ndescribed but you I'll say discovered\nbecause um that's what happened you\ndiscover these these cells you label\ntheir connections you see that there's\njust two Stations between these cells or\none station really between these cells\nand the brain and so now these cells can\nsense chemicals in the gut that are the\nconsequence of the breakdown of food and\nsend that information directly to the\nbrain what does the brain do with that\ninformation all so here comes uh the key\nexperiment and this was building\nobviously on the work of other\nscientists that had already described\nthat the gut had some uh receptors for\nuh sugars for specifically for glucose\nfor other nutrients around this area in\nthe early 2000s when we were starting to\nbe able to identify some of these cells\nthen uh it quickly became uh obvious\nthat uh these cells these\nenteroendocrine cells throughout the\nlining of the stomach intestine colon\nthey had multiple receptors for multiple\nnutrients you know like we have the\nmacronutrients for instance sugars fats\nproteins but within them we have you\nknow a repertoire of molecules you know\nmultiple uh lipids multiple types of\nsugars and so on and so forth and these\ncells depending on their location they\nwill Express a different type of\nreceptors or a combination of those\nreceptors and I said depending on the\nlocation because when we're eating let's\nsay an apple you know the apple is going\nto be partially undigested by the time\nthat it enters intestine but by the time\nthat it gets to the the colon most of\nthose nutrients have being absorbed and\nperhaps only fibers are surviving to\nfeed off most of the microbes that live\nin the colon right so the gut has\nevolved to mirror and to become a velro\nto the molecules that will be in that in\nthat specific space so it will detect so\num it will detect sugars more in the\nproximal intestine but fibers or uh\nfermented by products more in the distal\nintestine or in the colon like shin\nfatty acids beate prop propionate um and\nso on and so forth you know what other\nkinds of nutrients do these neurop pod\ncells detect from food so you mentioned\nsugars you mentioned ferment\nfermentation so um presumably short and\nlongchain fatty acids yes the short\nanswer is that uh I think that in due\ntime we are going to realize that they\ndetect just about every single thing\nthat we put on our mouths every day you\nknow uh that they have some either an a\nspecific receptor that is dedicated to\nit or a combination of receptors to be\nable to detect um some of these\ncompounds and not only the chemical\ncompounds but also an area that I think\nthat is going to be fascinating in the\nfuture is the mechanical distension plus\nuh the the adjustment in temperature\nas the Kim starts to flow\nfrom the mouth into the colon like for\ninstance I I I heard this from a\nbioengineer not long ago that was\nengineering a artificial gut on a\nstomach and he uh shared with me um a\npiece of information that I was not\naware of that uh the esophagus has to\nadjust the temperature of the food very\nrapidly within seconds into\nphysiological temperature of the inside\nof the the body like so we are having\nhot coffee within couple of seconds it\nhas to be at the physiological\ntemperature of the body by the time that\nit gets into the stomach right and all\nof that happens in very rapidly amazing\nsuff right so if I understand correctly\nthese neurop pod cells have a variety of\ndifferent receptors depending on where\nthey are located along the trajectory\nfrom the mouth to the rectum that's\ncorrect and some are sensing sugar some\nare sensing temperature some are sensing\npH so relative acidity some are\nsensing amino acids presumably I mean\nI've heard it said and I believe there's\na a researcher down in Australia who's\nbeen very bullish on the theory that we\nare not exclusively but we are\npredominantly amino acid foraging\nmachines because we need amino acids for\nall sorts of important biological\nprocesses um and these cells are\nessentially evaluating how how much\nsugar how much Lucine how much um uh\nshort chain fatty acid how much um you\nknow essential fatty acids of different\nkinds and then making changes to the gut\nitself but then presumably signaling\nthat information elsewhere in in the\nbody so um here I'm going to give you a\nsomething that will get your gut\nchurning so to speak so these cells have\nto make sense not only of the molecule\nthat had been ingested meaning the\nchemistry of the molecule let's say it's\nglucose it has to make sense a little\nbit of The Taste is it sweet right is it\nbitter then it has to take into account\nhow much of the molecule is absorbed\ninside of the cell right so that's the\nsecond layer of integration then once\nthe cell has eaten that molecule so to\nspeak then that molecule will be\ndigested inside of the cell to release\nATP or some other uh compound ATP is for\nenergy for instance that has also have\nto be taken into account for instance in\nthe in the in glucose glucose activates\nthe tas1 R3 which is a sweet taste\nreceptor then the glucose is absorbed by\nsome of the sodium glucose Transporters\nwhich are active Transporters and these\nTransporters uh depolarize the cell and\nthen once glucose gets inside of the\ncell glucose enters the TCA cycle is\ncatabolized and then produces ATP and\nthe ATP further activates another uh\nvoltage gated Channel\nfurther depolarizing the cell and then\nthe cell releases in turn a transmitter\nfor instance glutamate that very rapidly\ntells the vus nerve within milliseconds\nyou know I got sugar uh and it tells it\nin two phases because that glutamate\nwill activate two different type of\nreceptors ionotropic which are very fast\nand metabotropic which are a little bit\nmore you know more delayed uh but then\nthe metabolism of that glucose that\nproduces the ATP and farther polarizes\nthe cell we believe that um it will\ncause the release of the hormone of the\nneuropeptide so then the neuropeptide\ncomes on top of that and gives you that\nfull experience of what it means to uh\nconsume sugar right um so that happens\nat the level of one cell and at the\nlevel of one molecule so imagine like\nall of the computation that the gut has\nto be making for each one of the\nmolecules throughout the digestive\ntract so if I stand back from the\npicture um what I get is there are very\ninteresting cell types that line our gut\nthat are\nevaluating all of the not just\nmacronutrients proteins fats and\ncarbohydrates but micronutrients within\nthe food we eat as well as some of the\nother qualitative features temperature\nfor instance maybe even quality of the\namino acids or the sugars you know\nsimple versus complex sugars\nEtc if we could just further zoom out\nfor a moment and take a human\nperspective on this at the level of\nexperience I once heard you tell a story\nabout um someone you knew who changed\ntheir gut\nradically and that changed their entire\nperceptual experience of food including\ncertain Cravings would you mind sharing\nthat story yes uh thank you for uh\nbringing that story Andrew that story is\nvery personal to me I of often say when\nI get on stage that we are constantly\ninfluenced by two things in life the\nfood that we eat and the people that we\nmeet you know like now I uh we have\nknown each other but now we meet in\nperson and we are knowing other people\nright and I remember that when I was uh\nstarting my PhD in nutrition at North\nCarolina State University I was uh so I\ndidn't grow up in the United States I uh\ngrew up in Ecuador and uh I was invited\nto my first Thanksgiving celebration so\nI sat at dinner and you know as we began\nchatting with uh the people that were\nnext to each other uh all of a sudden I\nwas uh enthrall in this conversation of\na woman telling me this story about her\nexperience with gastric bipass surgery\nfor treating obesity so gastric bass\nsurgery uh was begun to be um developed\nby surgeons uh in the 60s and by the 90s\nit had become a mainstream uh type of\nsurgery for the treatment of uh chronic\nobesity so she told me that there were\nprimarily three things that happened she\nsaid well within uh six months of the\nsurgery I had lost about 40% of body\nweight you know she said like I was\nabout 300 pounds you do the math you\nknow so it was a it was a significant\namount significant amount she said\nwithin one week of the surgery my\ndiabetes was gone she said I did not\nneed more insulin shots so I had the\nsame reaction that that you're having I\nwas like that you know I don't know much\nabout diabetes but I know that is is a\nmajor health uh burden\nright but the thing that really caught\nmy eye was when she said but since\nyou're studying nutrition I want you to\nanswer this to me she said why is it\nthat before the surgery I could not even\nlook at sunic Side Up XG she said uh\njust looking at the Yoke will make me\nquizy you know but after the surgery no\nnot only I can eat sonide up eggs I\nactually have a craving for the yolk she\nsaid every time we go on Saturday to a\nrestaurant for breakfast I will take the\ntoast and will actually clean the plate\nuh of the Yol so how is it that rewiring\nthe the gut uh alter my perception of uh\nof flavor alter my my cravings and my\nmind to to get the the Yol she said and\neven inverted her sense of what was\naversive versus repetitive and and I\nguess for those of us that don't know\nmeaning me um I understand the gastric\nbypass surgery involves the removal of a\nportion of the of the gut um how much\ngut tissue do they actually take is it\ncentimeters inches I mean the guts a\nlong distance so what what what do they\ndo for gastri in in in simple terms the\nmost\num the classic surgery is called uh ruin\ny gastric bypass surgery which involves\na a reduction of the stomach and short\ncutting the uh connection of the stomach\nto the intestine so you will cut you\nknow 1/3 which will be the dadum uh one\nthird of that will be uh cut and then\nthat portion will be reconnected to the\nstomach meaning that you're short\ncircuiting the the gut and the whole\nidea was at the very beginning was like\nwell if we reduce the surface that is\nexposed to food then we can reduce body\nweight by the simp L um reduction of\nsurface that is exposed to the food that\nis absorbed right and uh what it became\nvery clear is that well before the body\nweight uh changes got taken place uh\nthere was already like some dramatic\nchanges in physiology like like the\nhormones the neuropeptides that we\nrelease from uh the intestine in\nresponse to nutrients you know will\nchange very rapidly then as I mentioned\nthe food choices will change diabetes\nwill be resolved um so then it became\nobvious that it was not necessarily just\nthe the uh reduction in the surface of\nof the gut so that's one of the main uh\nsurgeries the other one um as I\nunderstand is vertical isaf gastrectomy\nand this vertical s gastrectomy is\nsimply a a reduction in the size of the\nstomach so is now the stomach is very\ntiny and the idea is that will\naccumulate uh less it could hold less\nfood and then the food will go very\nrapid rapidly into the intestine and\nwhat is very is becoming very obvious is\nthat there is a rapid change in the\nsensory function of the gastrointestinal\ntract so the gut seems to rapidly shift\nperhaps become more so to speak in\ngeneral terms more sensitive to the\npresence of nutrients right interesting\nso this woman that you met at\nThanksgiving had G gastric bypass\nsurgery and presumably I think it's fair\nto assume a good number of these neurop\nhot cells that sense different nutrients\nwere removed and as a consequence she\ncompletely shifted her craving of a\nparticular food and is there any sense\nwhether or not no pun intended the lack\nof sensing of what was in uh you know\nSunnyside egg yolks was somehow related\nto a shift in appetite or something else\nor is it merely a a a um a qualitative\nalbeit a dramatic qualitative sh in in\nwhat she craved so two uh contextual\npieces of information uh so I remember\nleaving that dinner and I was like wow\nthis is Major you know like I'm sure\nthat people have green about this or\ndon't research um and I realized that it\nwas very little was known even\ngastroenterologists knew very little\nabout this the first clinical report\nthat um the alteration in food choices\nwas common in these patients uh came out\nI believe in\n2011 uh and then later on scientist\nreplicated that even in rats or in mice\nuh we have done it in the laboratory and\nconsistently they they change their food\npreferences their their um food choices\nso er in in recent years we have been we\nhave been uh studying that that system\num and I will tell you that in\n2022 this is another important\ncontextual piece that we have gotten\nhave not gotten to it so after we\nuh found and we describe that these\ncells were connecting to the nervous\nsystem and that they were sending\ninformation up to the brain very rapidly\nthe challenge was well if this is a\nsense what behavior is affecting right\nlike how is it that is affecting the the\nresponses of the organism and that took\na little bit of a a technical hdle and\nhere is where optogenetics uh comes in\nyeah please um explain for people what\noptogenetics is in at least at a top\nContour level yeah so optogenetics uh\n205\nuh Professor Carl daero Ed boen and\nother scientists had been able to make\nthis this dream of an experiment which\nwas uh isolate the the genes that encode\nfor these opsins that are sensitive to\nspecific wavelengths of light and put\nthem into neurons and now by turning\nthat light they could make the neuron\nactivate and then ultimately then later\non they went on to describe that that\ncould be used to control a specific\ncells that are regulating behavior and\nthen by that Define what cells are\norchestrating certain type of behaviors\nlike movement food intake thirst anxiety\nso on and so forth so in 2014 we we\nbegan H trying to adapt that technology\nto the\ngut very quickly\nwe realized that the way that was that\nlight was brought into the brain was\nthrough a fiber optic cable that was\nrigid and uh and in the brain you know\nit it helps that it's actually rigid but\nin the gut it doesn't help because the\ngut is constantly moving and so on and\nso forth so it's not compatible for\nrunning those experiments and here's\nwhere I usually say like you know we\nreally don't know what is going on\nbecause some some forces like move\naround us and in 2017 uh Professor\nPaulina Nika from MIT came to give a\ntalk at Duke and uh she reached out to\nme and literally she came and as we were\nchatting she said like Diego I see that\nyou're you're working between uh in this\ninterface of the gut and the brain and I\nhave this fiber optic that is flexible\nyou know would you have any use for it\nso with that H fiber optic that made a\nbig difference to study interrogate the\nfunction of these cells to\nbehavior so when we were able to put\nthose opsins the light sensitive uh\nproteins inside of these neurop pods and\nnow when we turn the light on to shut\noff these cells very\nrapidly we found something very\ninteresting so normally animals when you\ngive them the choice between a suer\nwhich is the void of caloric value so\nlike a like a aspartame or or Stevia or\nsomething y uh and you give them\nsugar table sugar the animal invariably\nwill go to Sugar they prefer sugar they\nprefer sugar you know uh if they have\nnever seen sugar it will take them a\nlittle bit more time but regularly um by\nthe second day is within 90 seconds that\nthey detect what is sugar so they're\ndrinking out of one tube they get some\nwater with stevia they drink out of\nanother tube water with sugar and they\ninvariably prefer the water with sugar\nthat's correct and uh people have\ndescribed this um this phenomenon for a\nwhile and in fact in 2007 There Was An\nElegant experiment done by Professor Ian\nDeo at Duke University in which the uh\nsweet taste receptors were or the The\nTaste uh receptors were genetically\nerased and the animals um were not\ncapable of distinguishing the sugar the\nsweetener from the water but they could\nstill distinguish sugar from uh water\nmeaning that there was something else\nthat was detecting that that sugar so\njust to make sure people are on\nboard an experiment where sensing of\nsweet taste at the level of the mouth is\neliminated does not disrupt the\npreference for sugar water correct which\nmeans that there's something going on\nbelow the depth of\nConsciousness that\ncauses mammals presumably us included to\nprefer things that have\nsugar yes and uh then uh Professor ton\nclani he had been studying these uh\nthese behaviors and he went in so far to\nsuggest that perhaps the sodium glucose\nTransporters are some of the ones that\nare detecting the the sugar as it enters\nthe intestine and that's what is causing\nthe\nbehavior um so we began working on the\nsystem and we we Wonder Could these\ncells\nbe the ones that are guiding that\nBehavior Uh and around the time that uh\nwe published this work uh Professor uh\nCharles zuker at uh Colombia also\nfurther uh Advanced that that area by uh\nbuilding on the on the previous work and\ndemonstrated that um there were a\npopulation of neurons in the brain stem\nthat were integrating this information\nfrom the gut uh and by that the gut and\nthe Brain were guiding this this\nBehavior so and it is true that from the\nearliest of Ages We crave sugar or at\nleast if we are exposed to the taste of\nsugar it tends to drive seeking of more\nsugar you can see that in babies even\ncorrect and as I usually say um I call\nit instinctively because our mother\ndoesn't have to teach us hey uh Diego\nthat is glucose you know uh it may\npresent Us in some ways but uh at the\nend of the day I have to go and get my\nglucose get my am acids right because\neating is very simple we're just trying\nto solve this issue of getting our\ncarbons getting our nitrogen getting our\nphosphorus our potassium our sodium and\nour chloride in so many different ways\nshape or forms right so I went back to\nthe experiment the key experiment so\nwhen we were able to put these opsins\nand bring the light and shut off these\ncells very rapidly when we had presented\nthe animal with the choice of sweetener\nover sugar\nthen all of a sudden the animal became\nblind to the solutions it couldn't\ndiscern between the the the stevia so to\nspeak or the sweetener from the actual\nsugar and the entire manipulation the\nexperimental manipulation that is is\noccurring at the level of the gut the\nintestine that's right right after the\nstomach it's like just a small portion\nof the intestine so if we make an\nattempt to transfer this to the human\nReal World Experience um um if\nI have some ice cream it tastes sweet I\nlike it and now I'm thinking about it\nand I'm craving it just a little bit I\ndon't have a huge craving for sweets but\num I do like some of them so eating ice\ncream it tastes sweet the tendency is to\ncrave more that's correct right you have\nto eat a lot of ice cream before you're\ntruly full yeah um and most people\nself-regulate or their parents regulate\nfor them\num by limiting the number of Scoops or\nsomething um\nand that sweet taste is part of the\nmotivator but what you're saying is that\nas the ice cream enters the gut there\nare neurop pod cells there that are also\nsensing the sugar and signaling to the\nbrain and the brain is responding to\npursue more of that sweet containing\nsubstance that's correct and it's\nhappening below our awareness it is\nindependent from the Sweet Taste of the\nice cream correct the the conscious\nsweet taste the conscious sweet taste\nwhich if you think about it it's not\nfully conscious right you know as a what\nwe detect of the world it's just a very\ntiny little portion right even sight you\nknow like we think we are looking for\nlight but I don't know what is happening\nbehind my my back I trust that\neverything is going okay right so um so\nwhen we shut off uh the\ncells uh the animal and as I usually say\nlike became blind to the sugars because\nit's kind of like uh a keing to having\nturn off the cells that are able to\ndetect light the wav length of light for\nus to be able to discern color right and\nit's not that the animal is losing its\nmemory because then you if you remove\nthe light and now the the cells are\nfunctional again then the animal again\nis able to distinguish one solution over\nover the\nother uh and then we did a couple more\nexperiments in there and what happens uh\nif we do the reverse if we turn on the\ncells\nnow and the fascinating thing is that\nwhen we turn on the cells now the uh the\nmouse will eat the sweetener as if it\nwill be sugar interesting so the\nactivation of these\ncells makes them crave non-caloric\nsweetener or low calorie sweetener as if\nit were\nsugar but is it blinding them to the\ndifference between sugar and low calorie\nsweetener so here's another piece of\ninformation if we will offer them water\nand we will turn on the cells the animal\nwill drink the water as if it will be\nsugar like it will be appetizing even\nthough it's just plain water yes and\nwhat is becoming very obvious is that uh\nthe gut has this sense at the most basic\nlevel\nwhat the senses are uh doing is\ncalculating a couple of things one is um\nin the salience of the stimulus is like\nhow intense is the stimulus and the\nother one is the veilance of the\nstimulus is a pleasurable or painful so\nto speak in like broad terms and I say\nthis because on the on the pain side\num uh Professor David Julius professor\nhly in\nuh jinra at UCSF they have done some\nbeautiful work demonstrating that there\nare these serotonin releasing\ncells specifically in the colon they\nhave focus in the colon that they couple\ntwo a nerve fibers of the spinal cord\nand when they are activated now all of a\nsudden they drive what we call in the\nclinical uh realm visceral hypers\nsensitivity so they are responsible for\ntriggering the hypers sensitivity of the\nnerve fibers the colonic nerve fibers\nbecause they detect no noxious stimuli\nand then ultimately they gate that\nnoxious stimulate and pass it on to the\nnerve fiber as a in Broad terms as a\npainful stimulus so is this irritable\nbowel syndrome it is we could call it as\nthe biological basis of what could\ndegenerate into irritable bow syndrome\nand so on and so forth or these\nchronical GI uh they call them uh\ndisorders of gut brain interactions in\nthe clinic I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge our sponsor inside\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter meet your personal health goals\nnow I've long been a

inside tracker they\nhave a very easytouse online platform\nthat allows you to see the results of\nyour blood test and then offers you\nvarious actionable tools such as\nbehavioral tools nutritional

think\nabout the neural retina the light\nsensing tissue at the back of the eye\nthe ca the essentially mechanos sensory\ncells in the inner ear that respond to\nsound waves not directly but through a\nnumber of different transducers and this\nkind of thing and then of course Where\nYou Are all familiar with the skin and\nthat it responds to pressure light touch\ntickle itch\nEtc what I'm understanding based on what\nyou're telling me is that all along the\npathway from our mouth to our rectum we\nhave sensory cells that are evaluating\nthe chemical constituents of the foods\nthat we\neat emitting broad kind of maybe even\ncrude slow signals in the form of\nhormones to change our appetite our\nfeelings of well-being maybe our\nfeelings of not\nwellbeing um but also sending direct\nsignals to the brain to drive certain\ntypes of thinking emotions and behavior\nwhat sorts of thoughts emotions and\nbehaviors are foods known to evoke\nthrough this pathway from the gut\nbecause the story about the your friend\nthat had the gastric bypass and then\nchanged the relationship completely to\nthe craving of or the aversion to uh\nSunnyside eggs indicates that it's a\npretty crude as I'm describing a system\nto begin with but It ultimately\nconverges on pretty fine scale\ndecision-making you order this and you\navoid that um you really like this and\nyou really are almost nauseous at the\nthought of something else that's pretty\nhigh level decisions it might not seem\nlike it to most but um you know it's\nimpacting you know significant be\nBehavior or impacting Behavior at a\nsignificant level that's correct um and\nand uh when I think about that specific\nexample uh is\nthat after there has been this rewiring\nof uh of the\nintestine then now the intestine is very\nsensitive so to speak to the stimuli and\nwhen those lipids from the Yoke start to\nenter the intestine if that sensitivity\nhas changed meaning it could have change\nin how fast it reacts to the stimulus or\nhow fast it communicates to the stimulus\nand how s sensitive it is to the\nsaliency or like the the the strength of\nthe stimulus it could communicate that o\nwhat it used to be repulsive with a tiny\nlittle bit of amount now it is actually\npleasurable with a tiny little uh bit of\namount and here's a a clear example so\nit has been very well um I will say that\nit has been documented uh in the clinic\nthat patients that undergone gastric\nBass surgery they're actually more prone\nI think that the the the it goes from\nlike two to Sevenfold uh the likelihood\nthat they become and they they will they\nwill develop\nalcoholism really yes uh because now the\nway that they describe it is like well\nyou know either before I didn't like\nwine um and then now I you know after a\nfew months of a surgery I'll have one\nglass of wine and then all of a sudden I\nfound myself going to 2 three four you\nknow and then they will become either\nmore sensitive is still not known the\nentire biology but they will become\neither not only more sensitive but more\nmore attracted to that type of stimulus\nI can't help but ask about OIC monjaro\nand glp1 glucagon like\npeptide one um analogues which are\nreally out of all the rage right now at\nleast for discussion but many many many\nmillions of people are now taking this\nfor treatment of diabetes and for weight\nloss um my understanding is that glp1\nacts at the level of the brain the\nhypothalamus to reduce hunger but also\nat the level of the gut to give the\nsensation of more gastric distension is\nthere any knowledge of whether or not\nglp1 interacts with the neurop Pod cells\nand this pathway that you're describing\ngiven what these neuropodia\ncomplimentary question and uh in fact\nwhen I got into uh studying in this\nfield uh 15 years ago uh the study among\nscientists in this area uh glucagon like\npeptide was already very uh popular uh\nin the study in fact in this area it was\npeople were very focused on on the study\nof this peptide and they were very\nfocused on the study of this peptide\nbecause it was one of the most potent um\nstimulators of insulin release in the\npancreas uh after gastric bass surgery\nit will actually increase its amount in\nuh circulating levels uh and there were\nalready like uh some uh studies\nsuggesting that the the effect of this\ngluc glucagon like peptide it was\nactually not through the\ncirculation but more in a localized uh\naction onto nerve fibers especially of\nthe vus nerve so there was already like\nsomeone going um discussion about this\nuh and certainly some of these\nenteroendocrine cells these um\nneuroendocrine cells particularly at\nleast in uh in animals I think it's more\ndistal and uh in the digestive tract\nthat they do release this glucagon like\npeptide um one in response to primarily\nlike all of the macronutrients but\nprimarily\nsugar and then\nthese glucagon Li peptide one will act\non specific receptors of the nerve\nTerminals and then will trigger some of\nthe behaviors is also thought that uh it\nacts at the level of the uh the brain\nstem and what it will uh potentiate is\nthe reduction of uh\nappetite so I say that this is a\ncomplimentary question because what is\nhappening in the first few milliseconds\nis the actual choice and the actual\nfeeling of how you feel about food and\nwhat is happening in the minutes two\nhours later is the amount how much you\ncan eat right and when you should stop\nbecause after four hours you're going to\ncome back and feel again the tickling of\nthe gut because the gut starts uh to\nchurn again and it starts to call for\nfood remember it has to fit uh two giant\norganisms the host itself but also the\nmicrobes that are inside right so it has\nto H keep uh so to speak that that\nhunger going every 4 hours or so right\nso that's why the hormones are more\nacting on the\ncyclical uh\ncircadian way but the transmitters are\nacting in this very fast uh responsive\nway of uh the precise stimul stimuli in\na specific uh regions of the\ngastrointestinal\ntract so these neuroendocrine cells are\nreleasing glp1 or responding to glp1\nthey're releasing uh glp1 they're\nreleasing glp1 to shut down transiently\nshut down hunger and probably there is\nsome interaction between the cells that\nthey are they are having you know the\ntechnical term is autoc cring or they\nare having like power cring between the\ncells you know neuromodulation but\nprimarily let's say they respond to the\nstimulus and release gp1 onto the nerve\nfiber right I have a theory uh for which\nI have no direct data but I'd like your\nthoughts on um having spoken to a lot of\npeople that work on nutrition but also\ngut bra brain axis today and U\nmicrobiome in previous episodes that one\nof the key things that a human\nlearns somewhat unconsciously but also\nconsciously is the relationship between\na given food which macronutrients it\ncontains the ratios of you know\ncarbohydrate protein and fat the taste\nof that\nfood the amount of that food translated\ninto to calories but also physical\nvolume and then the\nmicronutrients why do I say this well\nthere are a growing number of studies\nshowing that the ingestion of Highly\nprocessed food leads to the intake of\nexcess calories or more calories than if\none consumes Foods in their more natural\nform single ingredient Foods or two\ningredient foods are very different than\na food that has a bunch of different\nthings in it and it seems to me that if\nwe were to look back into our Evolution\num sure people were making stews soups\nand things for a long time um presumably\nthe sandwich came about through a either\ndesire for convenience or taste or both\nuh you know putting Meats protein in\nbetween two pieces of bread something of\nthat sort um by definition of a\nsandwich maybe some vegetables in there\nas well some cheese but that what this\nwhole pathway along the gut is trying to\ndo it seems is to\ndeconstruct what's coming in what's here\nand shaping choices as you mentioned\nabout food Choice including the amount\nof food to further consume and whether\nor not to return to that food or to\navoid it and at the extremes it seems\npretty\nstraightforward and this is a very\nclassically described case right you you\ngo and you have the um you know the\nkungpow shrimp or you have the lentil\nsoup at a given place and a few hours\nlater you don't feel right start some\nsweating some gastric distress and you\ndevelop a pretty broad aversion to that\nfood or maybe the entire meal maybe the\nrestaurant maybe even that entire type\nof Cuisine depending on how um how much\nof a lumper or versus a splitter you are\nas we say in science right how much you\nyou make uh kind of large large bin\ndecisions or fine bin decisions um this\nis nerd speak for saying you know do you\ndo you go back to the same restaurant\nbut order something different or do you\njust decide to never go back again but\nthat's a pretty extreme case right the\nother extreme would be you eat a food\nit's delicious you feel wonderful the\nthe restaurant the people it's wonderful\nand you crave more of that food okay\nthere's all the contextual stuff too but\nwhat we really are talking about here is\nhow one navigates this whole landscape\nof what to put into one's body in terms\nof nutrition and trying to understand\nhow that's impacting everything from how\nwe feel right away how it tastes whether\nor not we conceive it as good or bad for\nus whether or not we think it's\nimpacting our body composition and\nhealth\nin ways that we want or don't want I\nmean it's pretty complex stuff right\nthis is at least as complex as going to\nthe Metropolitan Museum of Art and\nlooking at a painting and trying to\nevaluate whether or not you really like\nthat painting or not in fact it's\nprobably much more complicated than that\nbut it's what we do and I'm beginning to\nget the the asense again no pun intended\nthat this pathway that we call the gut\nbrain axis is really\nit's a six sense of a very elaborate\nkind so you just touch on a on an entire\nrealm of a topic which is one of my\nfavorite topics because at some point\nyou know uh we as scientists we travel\nwe travel the world and it started to\nbecome very obvious to me that wherever\nI\nwent we solve this issue of food in a\nvery similar way whether it's a tortilla\nor two pieces of bread which is another\nway of a\ntortilla uh you have your\ncarbs and then you add a little bit of\nmeat or a mushroom and now you have your\nprotein or fish or chicken or fish your\nchicken the the carnivores will say\nMushrooms not a protein the vegans will\nsay mushroom beans lentil great protein\nwe're not here to to resolve that debate\num do as you choose and then you add the\nlettuce\nor the\nvegetables and here's the first stop in\nthat com the first uh stop in that in\nthat discussion because this is\nfascinating there is some recent work\nshowing that if you remove the protein\nfrom a diet the animal swallows that\nthat that\nmeal ER the gut evaluates that there is\nno protein in there and it stops eating\nthat meal wow so this is like um\nordering the vegetarian Taco yeah or\nburrito or sandwich and then avoiding\nthat particular taco or sandwich\nthereafter because it lacks protein\nbecause it lacks protein okay so foods\nthat lack animal-based proteins are tend\nto be avoided going forward so here's\nthe second part of that no and in fact\nif the protein is low\nnot completely absent if the protein is\nlow the animal consumes more of the diet\nbecause it's trying to compensate for\nthe lack of protein and obviously if it\nhas sugars or fats that are more\npleasurable it keeps eating that that\nthat meal right I see if the protein is\ncompletely absent the animal\navoids that diet\nunless unless the diet is very rich in\nuh dietary fibers\nand the study that uh that I saw uh\nwhich I thought it was fascinating is\nthat because somehow the microorganisms\nin the digestive tract if they have\nenough highly digestible fiber now they\nturn on the ability to synthesize\nessential amino acids really yes\nso our gut meaning the neurons in our\ngut are essentially waiting for hoping\nwe give them a\nConsciousness proteins from animal\nsources that's\ncorrect if those animal proteins arrive\nin the form of meat fish eggs Etc the\ncells signal to the brain craving more\nof those Foods until satiety is reached\nbut in the absence of that protein the\nanimal quickly learns the person quickly\nlearns to avoid that particular food\nunless there's fiber in it in which case\nthese gut cells are able to now\nsynthesize the essential amino acids\nmicroorganisms excuse me the\nmicroorganisms of the gut here we're\ntalking about the microbiome now can\nsynthesize the essential amino acids\nthat ordinarily would come from the meat\nchicken fish or eggs that's right so wow\nso I'm I'm an omnivore I love meat high\nquality meat but I also love vegetables\nfruits and starches of certain kinds\nbut I have friends who are vegetarian\nvegan many of them eat a vegetarian\nvegan diet that includes a lot of fiber\nand you're saying that the fiber itself\ncan trigger the gut microbiome to\nsynthesize the essential amino acids\nthat ordinarily would come from meat but\nyou also said if I recall that if\nthere's a small amount of\nprotein so not zero protein but a small\namount of protein in there then We crave\nmore of that food in order to try and\nget compens protein very interesting\nbecause this is the first thing that to\nme squares the argument based on the\nobservation that or the hypothesis that\nwe are essentially amino acid foraging\nmachines and that complete proteins in\nthe form of meat fish chicken eggs Etc\nyou know there are those that argue\nthose are the quote unquote best forms\nof protein right the most complete forms\nbut there are many vegetarians and\nvegans who seem to thrive on a\nvegetarian vegan diet and you're telling\nme that perhaps their body is their gut\nmicrobiome is compensating for the lack\nof whole animal protein that's right but\nthe people who are trying to limit their\nmeat intake are what hungrier in general\nso you're better off either indulging it\nor avoiding it but not having a small\namount of it is that the idea the the\nidea is that uh the the the body or the\ngut will be able to detect that and then\nwe'll try to compensate right I see and\nthis I I actually learned um recently\nfrom a friend Laura dubal at Colombia\nwho works uh does some beautiful work on\nmosquitoes and how it is that they they\nfeed on uh blood she came for the\ngastronauts uh uh series is she from\nLeslie V Vel yeah and what I learned is\nthat when the mosquitoes are not\nreproducing they can leave off ATP which\nis the energy molecule right uh but they\ncannot lay X\nthey need the protein in order to be\nable to lay\neggs otherwise the mosquitoes cannot lay\nthe egg you know so this leaves us with\na picture of the gut sensing cells these\nneurop pod cells as\nexquisitely sensitive to amino acid\ncontent in our Foods um which makes\nperfect sense and it has not been\npublished or demonstrated yet sure we're\nnow in the realm of of new incoming data\nwe want to highlight this bracket it\nbold face and underline it as we're now\nat The Cutting Edge of what's may be\ncoming um that's right right observation\num but nonetheless very interesting but\nthere is this fairly long-standing\nhypothesis that we are foraging for\nessential amino acids because they are\nthe building blocks of so many important\nthings in the brain and body and in fact\nthere is evidence on that and Professor\nSteven Simpson in Australia uh in uh the\nuh in nutrition uh Research Institute at\nSydney University he is uh main\nproponent of these protein leverage\nhypothesis you know that and in fact\nprotein is the most assing uh\nmacronutrient so that that has been\nestablished and that's why uh normally\nwe have focused on sugars and fats but\nwe have neglected a little bit of on the\nprotein because it's not as pleasurable\nas the sugars or fats but what is\nfascinating is that is the most suting\num nutrient and as you know it's like\nthe most limiting and also like even\ncommercially is the most expensive right\nyeah I certainly have had the experience\nof um at one time in my life really\nenjoying and even craving sweet Foods\ndesserts and sugars and things of that\nsort and I noticed that over time if I\neat sufficient amounts of meat chicken\neggs fish and which is not to say that I\nconsume excess amounts of them that my\nsugar Cravings go way way down that's\njust my personal experience but I know\nit's an experience that family members\nof mine and others share as well but I\npromise you that this was a a fun um a\nfun topic right I couldn't uh we\ncouldn't stop at like just layer number\none layer number two is that in\nagriculture we have this instinct to\nplant plants that a complement each\nother like for instance a classic um\nespecially native among native\ncommunities is called like the three\nMarys uh I believe is a a um pumpkins or\nsome type of fibers with corn\ncarbohydrates and Bings so in purely\nplant-based diets there's an effort to\nget the fiber the sugar and the amino\nacids that's right and I grew up uh in a\nin a farm my my parents had farms and I\nremember when they will plant they will\nalso like throw in there the the beans\nand the beans will wrap around the the\ncorn and it just seem like so natural\nand that's what you will do because that\nwhat you learn to do but if you think\nabout it's an instin that we have\ndeveloped even agriculturally probably\nin the subconscious to cultivate them in\nsuch a way or perhaps the plants taught\nus how to cultivate cultivate them in\nsuch a way that now when we put them in\nthe\nplate it just makes\nsense ER at the nutritional level\nbecause if you think about it every time\nthat we go to eat how is it that we\narrange that plate right there is some\nrice which is very deficient in in some\nessential amino acids but is rich in\ncarbohydrates right it has some beans\nright uh and then there's some lettuce\nyou know and sometimes we have like for\nomnivores people will put meat or you\nwill put other types of protein in there\nright and certainly it varies by culture\ntime of year food availability and\nthings of that sort as long as we're\ntalking about um your upbringing um you\nhave a fascinating story um so maybe we\ncould could discuss that for a few\nminutes uh where were you born uh I was\nborn in the Amazonia of Ecuador a small\ntown called el Cho in Ecuador uh is on\nthe slopes of um the Eastern slopes of\nuh the Andes on the way to the\nAmazonia uh in the Napo Province uh\ncoincidentally was like through the path\nfrom where uh Francisco the Orana in uh\n1542 march on its way to the discovery\nof the the Amazon actually passed\nthrough a a trail that later on reading\nI realized that uh Native people had all\nof these Trails between the Amazonia and\nthe Andes and the coastal line for\nthousands of years so you grew up in a\nvery rural yes uh the uh oil had been\ndetected in the 1920s in Ecuador uh it\nwas first explorer in\n1964 in uh the first uh ER oil um um\nwell was uh in a town called lag Wago\nwhich now is only like three or four\nhours from the town where I grew up but\nat that time it was like eight hours the\nroads were not good and the first road\npassed through it uh in uh\n1974 uh I was born in 1983 but I\nremember that we used to have like a a\ngiant um diesel T engine that will give\nus a light electricity only from uh 7 to\n900 p.m. you know uh I remember when my\nfather bought the the first uh a um\ncolor television in the in the town and\nthen neighbors will come to the our\nliving room and then we will watch\nmovies wow and this was in the 80s that\nwas in the 80s right um such an\ninteresting upbringing so um did you eat\na purely vegetarian diet or you ate\nMeats as well where did those meats come\nfrom if you did primarily from a cattle\nuh goats ship so how do you go from the\nAmazon to a study of nutrition and\nultimately Neuroscience um yeah uh\nthat's the question right like the\ndeeper I go the more I question I used\nto think that oh it was very simple you\nknow like when I was um uh specifically\nwhen I was 11 years old\nuh my father he was born in\n1932 uh by\n19 he lost uh his father my grandfather\nwhen he was six years old then he was\ngiven away and he had to go and like\nbuild his his his life uh he was a very\nsuccessful entrepreneur but in the\nprocess he had made a lot of uh a lot of\nfriends and acquaintances so when I was\n11 years old I remember specifically\nthat a friend of of his who was in the\nSpecial Forces stopped by uh our home\nbecause that was the main road that we\ngo into the Amazon jungle where the uh\nfolks in the special forces in the in\nthe military will will be trained and he\nstopped by and said like hey roio like\nwhat are you going to do with Diego you\nknow like I think that is about time\nthat you know I think that you should\nsend him to the military school and I\nremember in a matter of like literally a\ncouple of weeks or three weeks I had\ngiven the taken the tests and um I was\naccepted into the military school and\nthen uh I ended up in a military school\nand this was the at that time it was the\npremier uh military school in the in the\ncountry that alone it was uh with years\nyou start to understand the context in\nwhich you you developed uh because it\nwas a a it was a very interesting\ncontext for for a child like just to\ngive you an idea uh these these uh this\nschool had the first and the only zoo in\nthe country so from my uh classroom I\nwould literally look at the at the at\nthe Lions and then I think that was by\nthe second year that I was in the school\nsecond or third year that became that\nbecause the the the city start to grow\nand then the the military school is\nwrong and then they separated the higher\neducation for Military Officers they\nseparated them and they put them in a\ndifferent place but that Zoo actually\nbecame the first zoo of the capital of\nKiton wait so you had a zoo with lions\nat your school yes and you said you\ncould could see the lions from your\nclassroom and they could see you\npresumably probably know yeah well I\nassume they could see you uh lion vision\nis pretty good I don't know what the\nresolution is but I'm guessing that\ntheir Vision yeah they they definitely\nuse their old faction but they are uh\nsight sight based Hunters as well so but\nI I have a specifically uh one memory\nlike climbing up I think was like from\nthe because we had an Olympic pool and\nwe had all of these events um they they\nthey the the soccer field uh was the the\nfield where the uh national team will go\nand train on because they didn't have\ntheir own their own um H training\ngrounds later on they had their own\ntraining grounds so but that was\nsomething that you just grow into it\nright like but you it was with the years\nand now especially like that I get to\nreflect on it I was extremely fortunate\nuh through that experience and that\neducation and now I'm I'm I'm here\nsharing some of the story and hopefully\nuh through that inspiring some people uh\nespecially young people that would like\nto go and chase their dreams you know so\nyou you went to military school in\nEcuador yeah you graduated and you\ndecided to go to to uh yeah so I was\nallowed to become\na so in the military school they will\nselect uh the top uh Cadets um like I\nthink was the top 10% and they will\nselect them and they will put them\nthrough a special training um so you\nhave essentially didn't have like what\nwas a normal summer vacation you know I\nwill go into a military\ntraining uh ER so for me it was going to\nbe very not easy but relatively\nstraightforward to transition into\nofficers Academy right like do four more\nyears like West Point here and then like\nbecome an officer right in fact I I had\na reserves officer degree when I\ngraduated but two years before\ngraduating a friend man who uh he prefer\nother types of uh careers he said like\nyou're not going to become a military\nright you're not going to go into the\nmilitary and he said you should probably\nstudy something that will help your\nparents and then I said what will that\nbe and he said like uh perhaps\nagriculture uh and I didn't think at\nthat time it didn't dawn on me uh that\nuh you know people can study for\nagriculture and agriculture is like the\nbase of food um er for all of us right\nand then I said where and then he\nmentioned for the first time this\nUniversity in zamorano which was founded\nwith some uh uh some funds that were\ndonated by um the founder of the\nStandard fruit company which eventually\nbecame I think chikita banana Zam\nzamurai and that is an oasis that is in\nHonduras outside of tusi Alpa so it's a\nboarding school you wear uniform so it\nwas kind of like military it's very\nstrict uh you cannot accumulate more\nthan uh 12 de merits otherwise uh they\nwill send you home how do you get a Dem\nMerit um hey you show up uh two minutes\nlate to uh work in the morning at 6:00\na.m. in the field and then you just get\nto two minutes late one De Mer 12 of\nthose you're out two demerits two\ndemerits you're out yeah you get a we\nused to get a um they they will check\nyour room so for instance a guest like\nyou if you will go there like they will\ngive you a every Wednesday they they had\nat seven M they will check your room but\nlike very meticulously right and if they\nfound a little bit of a dust on the\nwindow or something to the merits um and\nyou're going home if you accumulate\nenough you will go home right wow um so\nit really forms character right and then\ndo you do that with your kids no I think\nthat I have become do they make their\nbeds they do make their beds yeah okay\nbut that's that was the context and it\nwas then where I learned about two\nthings one is where this idea of getting\na PhD because I noticed that most of the\nleaders will have a PhD most of the\nleaders in the university and I realized\nin the United States is one of the\ntraining runs main training runs for\nphds and the other one was nutrition I\nwas a little bit more King on perhaps\ngoing into a Veterinary um uh\nschool and then uh I had an experience\nin a a dairy farm in uh California where\nI learned the value of uh nutrition\nthere was more prophylactic rather than\nuh a paliative or like treating the the\ncow right um and that kind of convinced\nme like to look for a uh training in\nnutrition and then a friend of mine uh\nthe late uh AEL gnat he was able to\nconnect me with um some uh some friends\nand my mentor at uh North Carolina State\nUniversity and that's where I ended up\ndoing my PhD nutrition you know and\nthat's where like the career be became\nand then maybe another detailing there\nis that that I uh I was so excited about\ntaking uh that's where I took my first\nphysiology class and all of a sudden I\nrealized that in a way the body was like\na machine right like obviously is a\nlimited way of thinking but the body was\nlike a machine and one of the professors\nwas um a\nneuroscientist uh and I took two\nphysiologies two human physiologies with\nuh with him and I was just thrilled by\nwhen he will explain how is it that in\nthe synaptic terminal there were these\nvesicles that had like these proteins\nthat will walk that vesicle in the\npreoptic active Zone and that's how we\nmake movement you know or something like\nthat um and I guess I kept that in the\nbackground of my head and when I had the\nopportunity to work in the gut uh I\napplied that so you were Enchanted by\nthe nervous system yes yeah as as I was\ntoo I I'm um nothing to me is more um\nspectacular than the realization that we\nare made up of these little tiny cells\nmany different types but that the\nneurons essentially govern our entire\nexperience of life it's just amazing um\nwell that's quite a journey from uh the\nAmazon to uh well this table and and\nmuch and much more of course um thank\nyou for sharing that uh so you grew up\nin a uh let's call it a plr environment\nthe Amazon at least from the pictures\nI've seen very um let's talk about plant\nBotanicals and um the idea that maybe\nplants for lack of a better way to put\nit have a certain intelligence or a\ncomposition that is not random with\nrespect to our interactions with them\nright uh you described how agriculture\nin some places has evolved to include\nand ensure the different macronutrients\nand essential amino acid intake even in\nthe absence of animal proteins you said\nthe pumpkin or the squash the corn and\nthe beans um what are your thoughts on\nPlants perhaps from the Amazon but\nelsewhere um too and their capacity to\nhave things in them um chemicals that\ncan be uh good for us at the level of\nthe gut but perhaps at the level of the\nthe brain or other organs as well yeah\nhow do you think about plants these days\nso the first thing you you you mentioned\nthere like uh intelligence right I mean\nI don't know like if that exact\nterminology applies but I I do like this\nword wisdom because it's reflected uh\nexperience right and I said reflected\nexperience because somehow we are uh\ngoing over the\nexperience and plants have been many\nmore Millions years of age on Earth than\nany other animal right therefore they\nhave had way more time to actually\nexperience the ground so to think that\nthey they don't know what is going on um\nI think it's a little bit uh perhaps\nnaive is the word I went to um the the\nthe main Court of the\nuh these Mayan um ruins of kopan at the\njunction between Honduras and uh\nGuatemala uh this was a very special\ncity of the of the Mayans and in the\nmain Court you see like all of the EST\nStellas which are like the main uh\nstones of the of the kings of several\ndynasties and at the top of one of the\nuh the the the stairs of on these\npyramids there is this giant uh\nSAA uh tree which is like 650 years\nold something like that so that tree was\nthere before the spers uh landed in\nthere when the um Mayans perhaps were\nstill celebrating things or perhaps\nright after right so imagine how much\ninformation that a organism has in there\nand we will be able to just tap somehow\ninto that information like\nclimate uh\nfluxuations organisms interactions\nmovements I mean like so many different\nthings right like that right now I don't\nthink that we even have the the language\nof being able to understand at the\norganismic uh level of how much\ninformation that is stor in one single\none of those organisms but then think\nabout uh a um uh a chloroplast for\ninstance or like one of the\nphotosynthetic uh organel inside of the\nthe the cells uh how is it that they\nhave been shaped for hundreds of years\nin those organisms right um and I think\nthat perhaps in the\nfuture uh this is more of a Sci-Fi right\nnow but perhaps in the future we we will\nbe able to harvest that type of wisdom\nwe will be able to understand a lot\nabout the uh about the the place or the\nEarth that we live in that's Point\nnumber one uh Point number\ntwo is that this plants have been\ninteracting and we have been interacting\nwith plants for hundreds of years right\nand obviously we are a consequence of\nthe environment right like here driving\nin in La uh or driving in a major uh\nCity uh for some of us is just like\nsecond nature right but if you go into a\njungle then all of a sudden it will not\nbe the same thing right but for somebody\nthat has been in the jungle for hundreds\nof years now all of a sudden they are\nable to describe with such a sensitivity\nof like how it is that the the the\njungle is uh the makeup of the Jungle is\nin there I've seen uh Native people\nwalking through the jungle without shoes\nand right before for stepping on a leaf\nstopping and then pointing out like look\nunderneath that leaf and then like\nlifting it out and then a tarantula\nright there like how do you even uh make\nsense of that like I don't have the\nsensory acuity or the wisdom to be able\nto figure that out uh but they do right\nand certainly that is a is is just a\nlevel of um sensory perception that uh I\nam not equipped with uh but I do think\nthat there's quite a bit of that\ninteraction in there to learn and then\nof course not only for food but also for\nmedicine for textiles uh and for many\nother uh\nfunctions uh these plants have been part\nof the ecosystem of how these people\nnavigate uh their world all the way from\nmaking a canoe to uh making a backpack\nto carry a fish from the river into the\nhouse right so how do you think we\nevolved food choices and flavor\npreferences I imagine humans you know um\nthat existed long before\nus being hungry the gut starts rumbling\nand there are all these plants\neverywhere and some nuts and some\nberries and things and so they had\npresumably no choice but to consume them\nand decide at the level of the the mouth\nlike that's bitter no that's not good\nmaybe eventually cook those and see if\nthat changes the relationship yeah I'm\nthinking raw Acorn versus cooked Acorn\nyou know yeah um but that ultimately\nthere was a lot of trial and error and\nthat these neurop pod cells which surely\nexisted for a very long time prior to us\nplayed a key role in Discerning what's\nin these plants barks Roots nuts berries\nwe're setting aside Meats for the moment\nand other animal proteins and making\ndecisions about what's nutritious what\nis safe what is not safe and that's a\npretty complex process given that some\nthings might taste okay go down okay but\nthen you run into serious trouble later\nbut given the critical importance of\ningesting sufficient amounts of\nmacronutrients and the need for\nmicronutrients to survive on a\nday-to-day basis much less reproduce\npropagate one imagines that you know\nthis is like almost as essential as\nbreathing you know and that and that\nthis\npath of in our nervous system of the\nneurop Pod cells to the brain for sake\nof decision making of yum yuck or\nme is perhaps one of the most important\ncore functions of the nervous system\nonce you get past the elements that\ncontrol breathing heart rate um you know\ntemperature regulation things of that\nsort I see it is some among the senses\nit's at least as important as vision and\nperhaps more in terms of making sure\nthat we survive from dayto day that's\ncorrect and uh here's where I think that\nis a large vacuum in\nbiology uh if I will be with my\nbiological my training in biology if I\nwould put my my hat of the training in\nbiology I wouldn't be able to explain\nmuch of like how is it that we figure it\nout because uh even if you just go to a\nBotanical Garden here uh in you know in\nthe city I will be really hard to figure\nout um you know what plant is for what\nright yeah what safe to e what safe to\neat not you know uh maybe like the Coti\nyou are able to figure that out by touch\nright so from the biological perspective\nI think that there is quite a bit in\nthere to explore and to learn there is\nsome very interesting work from the\nanthropological perspective so\nanthropologists and ER\nER botanists that were studying the\nplants um were exploring the jungles not\nonly the Amazon uh but Borneo Sri Lanka\nand so on and so forth and studying the\ninteraction of native people with the\nplants and if uh going through the\nliterature that\nliterature there is a pattern that\nemerges and like uh the native people\nthey talk about how it is that they\nactually learned from the plants that\nthe plants were the ones that were uh\nteach them you know so that's why I said\nfrom the biological perspective like how\ncan we make reconcile that uh I think\nthat there is still quite a bit of uh to\nlearn what does that mean to to learn\nfrom the plants I mean there's something\nthat intuitively makes sense uh and when\nyou say that I've heard about um you\nknow looking at plants as teachers about\nthe local environment you know when\nthey're open right they're light sensing\nwhen they're closed um but you know in\nterms of trans ating some of that to you\nknow how humans have learned to navigate\ngiven environments navigate meaning you\nsort of thrive in those environments um\nhow do we go about that does it mean\ntaking plants grinding them up and\nfiguring out the constituent parts or is\nthat too reductionist is that going to\nleave us with a parts list that doesn't\nmean anything sort of like if I split\nout all the pieces of a a car or an\nairplane um in front of us it doesn't\nreally tell us anything about that\nexcept what parts make up the thing that\nflies yes and that's why I said like\nthis is more on the anthropological um\nstudies that have uh you know especially\nfrom scientists that have gone there\nlearned the language leave with the\nnatives as natives you know and then\nstart to understand the dynamic of uh\ntheir culture and their\ninteractions um then that's when like\nfor instance uh how it is that they\nclassify uh plants the way that they\nclassify plants is like several levels\nmore richer than our classification our\nour scientific classification by um the\ntwo name system or the variety right\nlike for instance they take into account\nnot only the the flavor but also the\nshape uh the\nlocation uh how they uh interact over\nthe year how they react over the year uh\nfor instance there's this beautiful\nplant that\num people call it a the lips plant I\ndon't know if you have a very if you\nGoogle it you will see it uh it's like\nlips literally like lips it has like\nthese red beautiful lips like uh the the\nthe plant just looks like lips um and\nthen people use it for uh pain for some\nrashes skin rashes and also like in some\nrituals and like most of these plants um\nthe the way that the natives interact\nwith the plants is in a sacred uh level\nyou know there is this respect for the\nplant right um\nso yeah I think that uh biologically I\nthink that there is quite a bit in there\nto um understand and explore and Define\nI do agree with you that like just\nthinking about grinding it up and like\njust putting it in a in a t perhaps is\nto uh reductionist it could be a\nbeginning of a understanding but it is\nreductionist seems like nowadays in the\nfield of bioed research and clinical\nresearch that there's a lot of interest\nin uh plant-based\npsychedelics um you know LSD from Urgot\nand\npsilocybin\nmushroom um and so on and so forth\niasa iboga um so it seems like science\nand plants have merged at that level in\nterms of clinical implications of course\nthere are entire fields of plant biology\nthat are extremely important I think\nmost people probably don't realize this\nbut a lot of what we understand about\ncircadian rhythms\ngrew nope pun intended out of our\nunderstanding of plant circadian rhythms\nfirst and then it was translated to\nmammals your beautiful work by Steve Kay\nand and others um seeing the circadian\nrhythms in leaf opening and orientation\nof the whole plant and and other\nfeatures of plants that are mirrored by\nthe changes in um arousal level in in\nmammals including us which is why I'm\nalways telling people to get sunlight in\ntheir eyes early in the day and to avoid\nbright light um in the evening and night\ntime um so what are your thoughts on\nPlants as a source of medicine\npsychedelic or\notherwise I think that uh well\ntraditionally that's where medicine was\num developed from I was at uh the Oxford\nuh botanical gardens uh last year with\nthe family and uh we went into the\ngardens and they have a beautiful garden\nwas established in 1621 I think was the\nfirst uh Botanical Gardens in England\nand they have a beautiful uh medicinal\nplant collection and there was this very\nhumble uh a um uh what little sign with\na description in there uh that said in\nthere that about 80% of medicine it\nstill comes straight from Plants really\nyes uh and if you think about it uh it\nkind of makes sense right like because\nyou know when we think about like the\nthe medicines that we have been able to\ndevelop which have been phenomenal for\nespecially for certain chronic\ndiseases uh but we don't have like a\nbroad uh repertoire uh of it right um so\nI think that has\nbeen obviously a great Advance um in in\nour society that we have been able to\nidentify the molecules uh synthesize the\nmolecules package the molecules render\nthem by available in a specific sites uh\nand I think that when we are able to\ncouple that with the rest of the\nmolecules that the plants through their\nI keep saying their wisdom because\nsomehow they develop their ability to\nhave not only one molecule but like a\ncombination of other things that will\nprovide the full experience of of the\nplant right uh for instance uh Gera\nmattive you know it's not only caffeine\nright because it's very different than a\nshot of espresso you know if you take\nthe whole thing uh it not only gives you\nenergy but it gives you a full range of\nexperience that is specific to the\nyamatic which is a is a leaf right yeah\nit's a distinctly different um sub\nsubjective experience than coffee and I\nI enjoy both coffee and espresso and yum\nmate you um were the one who introduced\nme to gu guayusa which is a is a causing\nof jate because jate is parensis WUSA is\nelix WUSA and it's not as bitter as mate\nbut it has uh almost as much caffeine as\ncoffee and it has antioxidants and other\nuh compounds um which give you this very\nsmooth uh experience so natives in the\nin the in the Amazon they take uh a\ndrink of a WUSA every morning uh around\n4:00 a.m. between 4 and 6:00 a.m. they\nthey wake up early they actually call it\nyes like Joo willink early yeah some\npeople understand that joke he wakes up\nevery morning3 A.M he post a picture of\nhis of his Casio watch yep and he's\nalready training 4:30 so no no guay Uso\nrequired for\nJoo and\nuh they call it the WIA opina\nUra the hour of the WUSA and is a\nritualistic uh drinking of the WUSA in\nthe morning and where they talk as a\nfamily of the issues that they have had\nthe the days before or the week before\nlike either with other communities\nwithin the family if they have to\nreprehend or repr uh one of the children\nor talk to them about like some mistakes\nthat they're making and then they plan\nthe the full day of activities uh by\ndrinking uh\nWUSA and uh around 5:30 because they\nwill boil the W USA right and they keep\nboiling the W USA and they just keep\nadding uh water to it uh and then around\n5 5:30 then they will have what is\ncalled um the is a bowl of um\nCH and Cha is this\nH Palm date uh very rich in lipids and\nfibers uh so they will have the WUSA\nbecause the W USA they say that gives\nthem energy it heals uh any any pain uh\nit shuts down appetite so they will eat\nat like 3 p.m. you know shuts down or\nmodulates appetite as does your brma\nthose one of the more potent effects\nactually of of mate and guayusa is a\nmild to moderate appetite suppression\nand then if you combine that to Cha\nwhich gives you the lipids and then it's\nlike a full meal for until 3 p.m. and\nthen you they go on a work in the in the\nfields interesting so they're\nessentially starting the day with\nhydration caffeine and then they what in\nsome circles they call Fat fasting\nmeaning consuming lipids in order to\nStave off hunger I mean so highest\ndensity source of of of calories among\nthe macro macronutrients and is a\nvegetable um based diet I guess right uh\nare they a healthy culture do they live\na long time uh I am not\nuh and I should probably do more reading\nthat I'm not well educated in what are\nthe um studies that have follow up uh on\nthe ER you know and the healthy status\nof the community but what I can tell you\nis that uh at least colloquially I will\nsay that the diabetes those type of\nissues are not as prevalent but they do\nhave obviously through like social\nexposure they have other things you know\nyeah fascinating um this morning ritual\nof um conversation about family and\nculture and what's needed planning the\nday um we had on this podcast as a guest\nDr sain Panda who is um at the sulk\nInstitute for biological studies often\nknown for his work on intermittent\nfasting Tim restricted feeding but also\num has done beautiful circadian biology\nand he talked about um the use of\nFireside Chats um not the sord on stage\nbut you know uh gathering around fire at\nnight um is something that has existed\nin many cultures where people reflect on\nthe previous day and discuss issues\nsocial and work issues and sort of\ndissect what's happened and talk and um\nit's about um building and repairing\nrelationships um sounds like in this is\nit a what is this group is it a rural is\nthis a yeah native Native Community\nbecause there are like about 70 or so\ncommunities that have been uh documented\nin uh in the Amazonia with their own\nlanguage with their own traditions and\nuh many of them share the same uh type\nof traditions and if you think about it\nlike a podcast is a one way of an\nevolution of that conversation right\nlike where we can have this extended\nconversation and get this uh the more\nprimordial things the ones that we have\nthem in the prefrontal cortex right away\nand like discuss about like well you\nknow this discovers this identifications\nbut then we get to the the part of like\nwhat does it mean for the whole\nCommunity yeah there's um doing there's\nreflecting and then there's um resting\nand recovering right and there is\nsomething about like leaving that for\nthe next uh generation right you know\nyeah passing on of lessons better learn\nfrom the mistakes and success of others\nif you can as you go forward very\ninteresting um if we could I'd like to\nnow return to the biology the nervous\nsystem absolutely um and thank you for\nthat Voyage Through uh some of your\nbackground um in Ecuador fascinating I\num doe for a mug of guayusa um sometimes\nI'll mix the two the loose leaf yerba\nmate and the guayusa um and as you said\nwhat's how does he feel I really like it\num most of the time it's loose leaf\nyamate or cobu yamate um it's um but\nsometimes I'll mix in the GU guayusa\nleaves um and what I do like as you\nmentioned is you can continue to pour\nwater over them for many hours and it\ntastes different as the time goes on and\nmy guess is you're extracting different\nthings from it in different\nconcentrations as time goes on I realize\nit's not a precise science you know it's\nit's interesting today we're talking\nabout very precise neurons and methods\nof tracing neurons and spe sensing of\nspecific Amino acids and lipids at the\nlevel of the gut then we're also going\nto um more\nmacroscopic uh View kind of a broader\nscale view of the plants having many\nthings that um need to coexist in um in\ncertain ratios that the plants have\nevolved to create for us um so we're\nsort of straddling both both ends of the\nof the Continuum and if I could fit in\ntheir story I not long ago I visited a a\nfriend a native friend in um a in a\nnearby by town and he produces some of\nthe best uh chocolate uh what I say in\nthe planet you know because actually um\nuh the plants of theobroma cacao it was\nrecently documented there was a paper in\nscience not long ago that it was\ndomesticated in Ecuador in near uh where\nI grew up uh and uh they have done some\ntracing and genetic tracing and um so he\nproduces some of the the best chocolate\nlike literally like he harvested in\nthere and then he roasted grinded and\nthen he prepared uh for us in there and\nhe the Swiss are saying well the\nbelgians right are claim the best\nchocolate but now we know e Ecuador is\nthe place for the best chocolate I think\nI just got a lot of Swiss and belgians\nangry at me for saying that but um it is\ndo they have a very dark variety I like\nthe extreme dark varieties you know 95%\neven even 100% chocolate if it comes\nfrom a really quality Source can be\nabsolutely delicious it's like milk\nstraight from the cow right like and\nwhat he did is like he said like uh\nDiego you you have to try it um with\nWUSA and he mix uh the chocolate with\nWUSA as a as a drink a like as a drink\nboy like that will give you wings you\nknow guayusa hot chocolate yes and\nuh and it's a very smooth experience\nright like you're mixing this tea which\nis for energy with uh chocolate you know\nof the best quality so we're not talking\nabout eating chocolate and drinking tea\nwe're talking about about melting the\nthe chocolate in the in the GU in the\nguayusa it was something like Wonder\nhour kind yeah know of course I couldn't\nsleep until like 3:00 a.m. I think right\nthere's something to do maybe this is\nwhy these um these groups drink the\nguayusa so early in the day that's right\nyeah and I have to imagine I would need\ncaffeine at 4:00 a.m. 5 a.m. otherwise\nI'd be falling back asleep so yeah um so\nback in the gut and nervous system um in\nparticular within the brain we haven't\ntalked about the brain so much so the\ninformation from the gut is is sent via\nthese neurop pod cells up to you you\nmentioned the noo ganglion such a a cool\nname for a brain um an a ganglion in\nthis instance is an aggregate of neurons\nso it's a like a batch of neurons that\nthen send a connection into the brain\nwhat what brain areas do they send to um\nand maybe we could describe these by\nname but also by function what what they\ngenerally resp are responsible for and\nuh probably should be prefaced with\nultimately will go to the entire brain\nright everything ultimately connects to\neverything it's like Google Maps\neverything connects to everything but\nbut what are some of the primary uh\nrecipients of that information the\num first hubs into of sensor integration\nare in the brain stem you know um\nand for instance the nucleus tractus\nsolitarius is in a specific region\nwithin the the brain the Cal is one area\nand and NTS for those that don't know is\ninvolved in regulating hunger and\nappetite that's correct um other\nfunctions perhaps but like for instance\num that seems to be an area of sensory\nintegration for nutrients and when we\nsay drives hunger or appetite sensory\nintegration for nutrients I mean what\nwould be great is if you know people\ncould understand you know the the\nlanguage of the nervous system is\nchemical and electrical so when these\nneurons are active um we tend to Crave\ncertain foods you know seek them\nliterally go to the\nrefrigerator among the different choices\ngo to that thing and select that and put\nit into our mouth so so presumably it's\ndriving um reward systems motor systems\nI mean it um what we call hunger and\nappetite is really a kind of a a domino\neffect of a lot of different brain\ncircuits do we know whether or not the\num uh nucleus tractus solitus um\nprojects to the areas of the brain\ninvolved in dopamine release and craving\nuh yes uh and there has been some\nelegant work uh from several different\nuh neuroscientists in this area like\ntracking the the\ncircuitry uh from there onto many other\nuh different areas the hypothalamus for\ninstance very basic behavioral fun\nfunctions um and the the stum where\nthere is dopam dopamine release and then\nthere is this pleasurable sensation and\nreward uh there is several other areas\nin there that are involved in this uh\nsensory\nintegration uh there is quite a bit of\nwork still to be done from specifically\nfrom uh the neurop pods there is like\nsome evidence that they are connecting\ndirectly to um or there are if you put\ntwo papers together is obvious that\nthere connecting to like some of these\nareas of dopamine release uh basal\nganglia in the in the in the brain um\nand that's why they're causing this\nreinforcing uh effect like in the\nlateral hypothalamus and uh other other\nareas I do think that\nultimately um there is quite a bit of a\ngap in like different regions of the\ndigestive tract like we today we just\ntalk about the esophagus right like the\nesophagus I think that is still\nthere is a little bit of work uh perhaps\nI think that Steve liberis has worked in\nthat in that area another great neuros\nscientist uh doing some uh very fine\ndetailed work in sensory biology uh in\nesophagus uh there is quite a bit of\nMis lack of uh precise biology in how it\nis that the esophagus specific cells of\nthe esophagus are inated or like making\nsense of the environment and same thing\nfor the stomach and how it is that\nultimately each one of those regions are\nfitting into different regions of uh the\nbrain uh even then how each one of these\nvalves I'm fascinated by the each one of\nthe valves that we talked earli on like\num the gastroesophagal uh sphincter or\nthe pyos or the oscal junction yeah we\nshould um illustrate for people I'm not\nan expert in the gut by by any means but\nwhat Dr borquez is referring to is that\nyou know the gut as it extends from the\nmouth to the rectum is not just a series\nof tubes of different uh diameters uh\nbut rather they have valves Chambers and\nthese sphincters that cut off you know\neveryone hears the word sphincter and\nthey always think oh you know anal\nsphincter and then they ah you know it's\nlike you know Elementary School uh\nMiddle School humor but but sphincters\nare they they literally can close and\nopen to varying extent um in order to\nallow um passage or prohibit passage\nfrom one compartment to the next such\nthat the um certain things can take\nplace over time in one one region like\nthe esophagus or within the stomach or\nyou know before passing to other um\nother Chambers and so I hear you saying\nthat critical processing is happening at\neach of these Chambers the sphincters\nare determining how long that processing\noccurs and that distinct sets of neurop\npod cells are likely detecting distinct\nof qualities and quantities within the\nfood chemical qualities and quantities\nwithin the food and relaying that to the\nbrain that's correct and here's\nsomething that since we're getting into\nthe future of uh of this\narea uh and while there is not direct\npublished evidence yet I think that is\ngoing to be a a fun\narea um so the gut as the brain also\ngenerates these electrical patterns\nthose electrical patterns um change\ndepending on fasting versus feeding and\ncircadian rhythms probably can realize\njetl the God is asking you for a burger\nat 3:00 a.m. and your brain is telling\nthe God you know can you please go to\nsleep\nright um so these electrical patterns\nthese electrical waves that are going\ninto um that are uh being propagated by\nthe gastrointestinal tract there are\nlike several different cells like the\nENT neurons are coordinating these these\ncells there are also these uh in\ninterstitial cells of\nkahal so uh Santiago ramoni kahal uh the\ngreatest neurobiologist of all time\nthat's right it was named after after\nhim he actually has I think it's like in\nthe second volume of his classic uh book\non the uh histology of the nervous\nsystem one of the last figures talks\nabout like the inovation of the v in the\nin the intestine so I'm beautiful for\nthose that don't know kahal um shared\nthe Nobel Prize with Camilo Gogi in 1906\nthey together um developed tools and and\nmapped the uh structure of the nervous\nsystem and and it's fair to say that\nkahal had Supernatural levels of insight\ninto the nervous system he looked at the\nnervous systems of so many different\nanimals um in dead specimens the the um\nthe the joke even though it's not funny\nis that many animal species entered his\nlaboratory very few walked out um but by\nlooking at fixed specimens under the\nmicroscope and then drawing them in you\nknow select elements within them\nessentially came up with most of the\nmajor hypotheses about how the nervous\nsystem works not just its structure but\nneuroplasticity the failure of of\nmamalian central nervous system neurons\nto regenerate this is why after\ntraumatic brain injury or stroke there's\noften loss of function that doesn't\nrecover sometimes it recovers but um and\nthat people who have injuries younger\nand can recover certain functions\neverything from the direction of\nelectrical flow through the nervous\nsystem all from looking at tissue that\nwas not alive no electrophysiology no\nbehavioral experiments just just raw but\nincredible Supernatural seemingly levels\nof intuition and insight amazing yes\nthere is a some quote in uh one of his\nbooks that when he got invited to uh one\nof of his friends to England I I don't\nremember remember he was a he was a\nfamous neuroscientist at the time in the\nlate 1800s that who had helped him to\nexpose um his work to other audiences\nyou know and invited him to to England\nso he said in there that it took like\nthree months to go to that podcast right\nlike it was a three-month trip trip so\nhe said that he brought his\num microscope with him with him and in\nthe in the room he will be able to do\nsome of these uh uh observations yeah\npeculiar guy also known for carrying a\nvery heavy iron umbrella in order to do\nphysical exercise on the way to the lab\nhe was a he was a very very fit physical\nspecimen also um reportedly reportedly I\ndon't know which uh pick it pick which\none um a pretty Gruff person not\nterribly Pleasant uh to be around ran a\ntight ship um but in any event um so the\ncells of the gut are named after some of\nthem are named after kahal interstitial\ncells ofal there you just got a a waltz\ninto um uh into some Neuroscience\nhistory but critical history so they\nthey have this emanating uh electricity\nright and uh so far these uh and it\nseems like the the sprinters modulate\nthe emanation of this electricity oh\nlike a like an instrument it it's um and\nyou probably think like that because the\nintestine and maybe here we get a little\nbit even deeper into this and I uh read\nsome work from a\nphilosopher uh in the UK who was and I'm\ngoing to paraphrase it very largely you\nknow so please don't quote me but it's\nsome something along the lines that uh\nif we are what we eat the place where\nfood becomes us and we become food is\nshould be the intestine right because\nthat is where food is actually absorbed\nright so that is a is a very fascinating\nPoint number two is that the food enters\nus at a\nfrequency that it will modulate the\nentire body\nright therefore like the the body H\nthrough these electricity these\nelectrical waves should be in sync with\nalso the electricity of the entire uh\nnervous system so I think that here's\nwhere in the future I think that there's\ngoing to be a fascinating realm of\nunderstanding how it is that these waves\nof the body and the Brain uh are\nsynchronized with each other uh because\nas we know like for instance sometimes\num when we don't uh we're hungry we\nbecome hungry you know like uh we become\nirritated by the fact that we don't uh\nhave food and perhaps is this dissonance\nin the emanation of the electrical waves\nbetween the digestive tract and uh the\nnervous system so I think that that is\nthat's just like one of the one of the\nRealms um of\nhow it is that the brain is connected to\nthe gut at a more uh organ to organ\nlevel to be able to make us function\nultimately right because um that's how\nwe are integrating the outside world the\nfood into our entire system so we can\nmaintain the entire organism well\ncertainly our level of alertness is\nlinked to our level of anticipation and\na lot of our food anticipation\num impacts our levels of arousal AKA\nalertness so as you mentioned in the\nwe're di we're a dial species so in the\nmiddle of the night it's unusual to get\nhungry right A lot of these pathways are\nshut down digestion is happening at\ndifferent rates and um typically our\nappetite is greater during the day than\nit is in the middle of the night that's\nright um but in addition to that you\nknow it makes good sense to me that what\nis going on at the level of our gut is\ngoing to tell the brain did we get\nenough nutrients from the previous day\nare we in a place of abundance um\nthere's also the psychological aspect of\ngut sensing um and we haven't really\ntouched on that what are your thoughts\nas both a scientist and a human with a\nwith a gut brain axis on this notion of\na kind of gut intuition you meet certain\npeople and it sort of relaxes and warms\nyou and you want to get to know them\nmore other people for whatever reason um\nyou just feel like I don't know\nsomething doesn't feel quite right that\nwe can sense things at the level of the\nbody that inform our brain um and no one\nreally understands that process yet but\nwe do know that the vagus nerve which is\na you know multi- uh pronged pathway big\npathway it's probably its own major\nbranch of the nervous system really um\nis is sending bidirectional\ncommunication between brain and body and\npresumably when we're around somebody or\nsomething that doesn't quote unquote\nfeel right\nthe Vegas is\ninvolved um a few interesting things in\nin that area uh I mean in the work of uh\nCarl Yun talks talks about it about the\nsubconscious and how it is that we're\naccumulating all of these experiences\nthat we have been uh passing through in\nlife is not that they are not a store\nanymore it's just that they are back in\nthe subconscious right and then\nultimately they become part of this\nso-called intuition right like we have\nthis G\nfeeling that uh and\n[Music]\num if we analyze um some of the\nlanguages I think that I've in past\npeople have told me in so many different\nlanguages that uh there is this phrase\nfor God feelings in so many like for\ninstance in I think Portuguese is fre of\nthe barriga you know like cold in the in\nthe in the stomach you get a cold uh in\nSpanish we call it a pre sentimento like\na\npreeing you know or pre yeah pre\nsensation or feeling it will be more\nfeeling if you translate that as if it\narrives first yes before you're able to\narticulate it right so uh there is this\nstorage in the entire body that gives\nyou like a depending on the context it\ngives you a certain type of uh feeling\nright and that's why we talk about uh\nintuition\nuh there's also like this this other\naspect of\num how it is that\nfood\nsynchronizes that\nintuition uh it seems to synchronize\nthat intuition among two or more people\nbecause if you think about it we have\nthis ritualistic way of uh serving\nsomething when we we we commonly say or\ncolloquially say let's go for a cup of\ncoffee and often what we mean is let's\ngo and talk about business the future\nresolve an any issue but we're talking\nabout the cup of coffee and we have to\nshare and people I think that there are\nsome psychologist that have run some of\nthese uh studies in which they say that\nif um the food that that we eat is more\nalike we are more likely to to connect\nat least on the moment right so there is\nthis aspect and that's why we share you\nknow the food interesting so is the idea\nthat it's the actual chemical\nconstituents of the food that's creating\na a common experience that then allows\npeople to bond more readily or is it\nthat the um the specific constituents of\nthe food are actually driving bonding\nper se I mean it yeah and we go back to\nif we are what we eat then if we eat the\nsame thing we should be more alike to\neach other right that's why you know\nlike in communities uh you share the\nfood in fact uh in like if you go into\ncertain uh specific uh communities you\npass around uh the food you pass around\nthe the drinks you know and is a it's\nvery common to share right yeah and\ncertainly in romantic bonding um there\nare many factors of course but um the\nkind of uh more basic functions of food\nsex and sleep represent the common\nplaces of\nbonding initially right and conversation\nof course and values Etc right not to\ndismiss any of those they're essential\nas well but in terms of you know um\nfeelings of safety that's right feelings\nof um communing with somebody right the\nthese very basic biological functions\nyeah and in business too right like\npeople there has been a studying like\nbehavioral uh Economist they talk about\nhow it is that business are more likely\nto happen when they are like made over a\nfood or launch or things like that right\nlike there's this synchronicity in the\ndecision making\nand here is a a third uh dimension on\nthis area that it has not been uh well\nexplored but I suspected in the near\nfuture it will begin to be explored I\nread a while ago a very elegant paper\nfrom uh Walter\nCanon uh so you may want to expand on uh\nwho Walter Canon was but uh one of the\nuh found figures of the study of\nphysiology yeah autonomic phy physiology\nright uh chair of physiology at Harvard\nuh 1920s\n1930s\nuh author of the wisdom of the body you\nknow uh he has a paper or he published a\npaper I believe in the\n1930s it's called voodo\ndeath um Voodoo death and I remember\nwhen I found that title I was like oh\nthis is something to sit down and\ndissect you know yeah good title good\ntitle if you want somebody to read it\ngood title and he essentially the gist\nof it let me see if I can uh if I can do\na little bit of justice but obviously I\nwill chop most of the details but um the\num the gist of the paper is that in some\nobservations in some native tries I I\nbelieve it was in in Africa\nthat if uh a young people especially\nyoung\nyoungsters uh if they were uh\nfrightened by a shaman that they will\nnot perform a certain thing a certain\ntask right uh they enter a level of\npsychosis so to speak that could cause\ndeath like the cast an spell right um\nand uh that's why called Buu death what\nCanon goes and describes is there is an\nactivation of uh the vus nerve and the\nperipheral nervous system that is a\nhyperactivation that is going through\nthe subal level of Consciousness and\nthat in some of these tribes uh that's\nwhat at least that's what he explains\nthat is happening and I believe that he\ndid some experiments in um in some\nanimals but what he was saying is that\nthere is a hypertonic activation of the\nperipheral nervous system when there are\nthese uh spells that are casted by a\nmember of the tribe that is in a higher\nor more Superior more influential uh\nposition that if the other a uh member\nuh especially if it is pair with\nsomething right like if you say like if\nyou go outside and don't listen to what\nI just told you and you see a black cat\nthose two things uh match together and\nnow you're hyperactivated right and\nbecome superstitious about it but it is\nwhat Walter Canon goes to explain is\nthere is a hyperactivation of the\nperipheral nervous system obviously\nthere is probably more details in there\nuh but the the the the paper um really\nhighlights an area of exploration that\nwe don't know about is a a threshold of\nsubconsciousness of the nervous system\nhow it is driving us to have\nSuperstition to uh Drive instinctively\nto go and consume certain things things\nor behave in certain uh in certain ways\nright yeah so it's um it sounds like\nit's par Association learning through\nstatements cognition but that's enacted\nthrough the Vegas in order to control\nthe organs of their periphery that's\nnerd speak for um if we hear and believe\nthat certain events will cause certain\nchanges in our\nphysiology they can in some instances\nbecome capable of that eat this food on\nthis at this location and you'll get\nsick eat this food at this location\nyou'll feel better cor and it's learned\nAssociation there's not and ultimately\nit's physiological but um it sounds like\nit's subject to a lot of learning\neffects as long as we're talking about\nthe Vegas I think it's a great\nopportunity um to just mention that a\nlot of people um understandably think\nthat the Vegas nerve activation is\nalways about calming of the nervous\nsystem and indeed it's the N the Vegas\nis um placed under the umbrella of a\nparasympathetic um pathway but I think\nit's very important for people to know\nthat both experimentally and clinically\nif the vagus nerve is stimulated you get\nexactly the opposite effect you get\narousal effects this is um commonly\nknown in Labs that do uh physiology of\ndifferent kinds um it's in the clinical\ncontext people with depression are\nsometimes treated with vagal nerve\nstimulators and it certainly isn't\ndriving more sedation more depression of\nthe nervous system it drives alertness\nand arousal so we have to I think make\nsure that we looked at the Vega system\nand describe the vagal pathway as one\nthat can both induce states of calm of\nease rest and digest as it's sometimes\ncalled but also states of arousal and\nalertness even fear and so I think of\nthe Vegas as a super highway of a bunch\nof different Pathways with lots of\ninputs and outputs that's highly subject\nto learning and um indeed the Vegas can\nslow heart rate you know down through\nnumbered things like long exhale\nbreathing earlier we were talking about\nstress modulation something my labs\nworked on extend your exhales that's\nthat's the most basic way um\nphysiological size two inhales followed\nby a full exhale to lungs empty um these\nare core physiological mechanisms known\nto activate the Vegas and lead to\ncalming but the Vegas I I look at the\nVegas as kind of a uh including both an\naccelerator of sorts accelerator based\nPathways in terms of arousal and and\nbreaks um and it and probably our basil\nlevel of vagal activation reflects sort\nof the RPM of our system how much are we\nare we calm or are we humming at a\nhigher level of activity such an\ninteresting pathway such an interesting\narea of the nervous system and we don't\nreally understand yet um even the the\nmajor branches and pathways are just now\nfinally beginning to be understood it's\nit's we're we're we're on um we're on\nVirgin beaches yes and right now that I\nI hear you uh bringing up the coming for\ninstance there is a branch of the vus\nthat inates the ear the inner ear you\nknow and that's why uh it is belief and\nI think there is a little bit of\nevidence out there that how a certain\nmusic at a certain frequency will calm\nyou down because it is immediately like\nbrings uh the it starts to make the Vos\nvibrate at a certain frequency yeah and\nhuming um has been linked to vasod\ndilation which is associated with a\ncalming effect whereas activation of the\nsympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous\nsystem or the kind of what sometimes is\nreferred to as fight or flight but it's\ninvolved in other things causes phasal\nconstriction and if you think about it\nlike in several uh religious practices\nthere is the humming right uh there is\nthe uh singing there is the sound the\nsound plays a big role in running there\nis a certain frequency that makes you\nrun uh make calms you more and makes you\nrun better you know is that right yeah\nuh there is some evidence at least among\nRunners that they prefer a certain type\nof uh frequency for for the running\nright so a certain uh pace of running or\nbreathing and the and the sound the\nspecifically the sound the sound of\ntheir feet yeah no the sound of uh the\nmusic like if you if you play a certain\nuh certain music right and probably the\nsound of their feet too right like it's\njust that it has not been explored right\nit's fascinating and you know so much of\nwhat I think about when I think about\nthe nervous system is the fine grain\nprocessing of you know of color of light\nor what but when it comes to our\nfeelings of well-being our levels of\narousal sleep Etc it's the rather um I\ndon't want to call them crude because\nthey're really sophisticated they evolve\nto be sophisticated but these um kind of\nmacroscopic signals like light coming in\nin the morning has these you know long\nwavelength and short wavelength contrast\nthat's what tells our brain it's morning\nthat's right it's the orange red blue\ncontrast even if there's cloud cover\nit's the it's the difference between\nthose to um different qualities of light\nthat says it's morning and when the sun\nis overhead you don't see that yellow\nblue or orange blue red blue contrast\nbut you see it again at Sunset and it\ninforms so um it sounds like the\ncombination of specific chemicals in the\ngut tell us this is good pursue more of\nthis and maybe even the place where you\nfound it is is a good place um as\nopposed to and the opposite is probably\nalso true yes like that's an entire new\ndomain of uh the the Digest\nthe sensory system in the digestive\ntract that we haven't even be to uh um\narticulate it memory how do we remember\nlike what was that first meal like in\nthe ratat uh\nmovie from when we were children right\nlike it was very different like uh I\nstill remember like some of the very\nsimple humble meals that my mother will\nmake but it's just Priceless for me\nright uh I whenever I go home and it's\nlike I I spec without asking sometimes\nmy mother uh will prepare those for me\nand it's like it just brings you back\nwhen you were that age right yeah the\nmemory system is tightly linked to taste\nand smell there's no question about it\nand then like the how it is that the gut\ntriggers that uh those Sensations or\nfurther reinforces those Sensations we\nhaven't even begin to articulate and\nwhen I said articulate because we don't\neven have the language to refer to these\nthings you know that's why at the very\nbeginning we were talking of the in our\nconversation about the axis you know and\nuh that we don't say like the nose brain\nthe nose brain axis right like we just\nwent for what we had at that time and I\ndo think that the language will continue\nto evolve for us to be able to\narticulate more precisely more richly\nmore elegant more you know in so many\ndifferent uh ways how it is that um a\nthe organs communicate with each other\nto make us who we are and in there um in\none of our papers uh we quoted uh these\nuh beautiful passages from uh the book\nMemoirs of by\nstomach uh it was greeting in\n1853 by a French by person by what it\nsays in the first page by the minister\nof interior\nbecause all of those who eat May read or\nsomething like that and then on page 21\nit goes to describe the dialogue between\nthe gut and the brain and it says like\nthat how it is that the gut communicates\nto the brain with a\nrapidity uh through uh these two sets of\nelectrical wires that communicate uh the\narrivals of the day as we may eat uh\nwith the Precision and rapidity to the\nbrain uh so the brain will make its own\nuh feelings and um\nImpressions and then he said that uh\nwhen he talking from the perspective of\nthe stomach it says like when I grew a\nmorose like meaning I'm not working in\ndigestion then the brain also grew\nirritable and petulant you angry angry\nit's so interesting to look at Human\nExperience from the directionality of\ngut to brain rather than brain to gut um\nthat's right and and you know as I do\nfrom time to time you know pay attention\nto what's happening in the landscape of\nwellness and mental health and physical\nhealth a lot of what um you see out\nthere in terms of you know Highly\nEducated people um who have thought very\ndeeply about how to navigate\ndecisionmaking and lots of different\ndomains of life and to do it in a way\nthat really honors the our own\nindividual preferences and needs needs\num people like Martha Beck I don't know\nif you've heard of her but she exists in\nthe she has triple degreed from Harvard\num but has uh talked a lot about um\nlearning to sense one's way into and\nthrough decisions through intuition that\nis more of the body and is more of\nparticular brain circuits than our\nanalytic like you know pros and cons\nlists um you know because pros and cons\nlists and obviously important metrics\nlike OB Ive metrics like oh is this the\nright salary the right location the\nright you know dem you know all the all\nthe things that matter for decision-\nmaking and we're trained in that in in\nschool in in the United States and in\nmany many areas of the world as well of\ncourse um and that's critical but that\nthere's this other training there's this\nother learning of self that can be\nextremely useful and it almost always\ncomes back to body first then to\ncognition and decision-making and I feel\nlike uh modern humans are are trying to\nlearn how to um run the the analysis of\nLife decision-making through uh this I\nguess more ancient axis so the again the\nintelligence of these what used to be\ncalled more primitive systems but I\ndon't think they're primitive at all and\ntalking with you today it's clear to me\nthat these are highly sophisticated\nsystems just as sophisticated as any\nforbrain pathway involved in um\nanalyzing say like probability or\nsomething and that's why I like to\nhighlight uh um\nthe example of having a nice meal and\nhaving a nice conversation at the at the\nat the same time you know if you go to a\nnice restaurant and you have a nice meal\nwhile you're having a nice conversation\nand you pay attention to it then it\nbrings humility to your body to know\nlike how much your body is doing for you\nto be able to just Express a tiny little\nbit and having like some sort of like\nhighly intellectual sophisticated\nconversation while you're able to put in\nthe precise amount of lettuce inside of\nyour mouth and chew it in the right way\nand like adjust it with a little bit of\nwater and maybe a little bit of wine and\nunderstand what is cleansing your pette\nand like you know putting down the the\nnapkin and so on and so forth uh without\ngoing to the restroom every time that\nyou feel like going to it right there is\nan entire sophistication of of the body\njust to have something like as simple as\na catchup convers ation you know do you\nthink that our ability to sense into gut\nsensing more um to really hear and\nrespond to the signals from the gut is\nsomething that we can learn even as\nadults simply by paying more\nattention yes and I think that here's\nthe the concept that I usually uh you\nknow that uh when we talk about topics\nlike meditation you know is that\nself-care and that self self-care is\nlistening to your own uh body right how\nit is that the body is feeling like uh I\ndon't know you know I grew up in a my\nmother will tell me like or you know\nfamily will tell you if you feel like\ngoing to the restroom uh and uh to pee\nfor a bio break uh don't hold it for too\nlong because it might be bad right like\nand I think that just learning that part\nof like listening to to the body is an\nessential aspect it's just that we're\nnot constantly doing it over learning\nabout how we are moving our career\nforward yeah so much of what we're\ntaught in order to um be high achieving\nand forward moving in life um in modern\nculture is about learning to override\nthe signals from the body but it seems\nthat um learning to listen to the\nsignals from the body is is key to being\na healthy human being yes and here I\nhave an example uh years ago I used to\nrun quite a bit um and I remember that\nafter I had ran a marathon uh I took a a\nbreak for like a few weeks and then I\ngot back on the on the trail and I began\nrunning and I was like you know I don't\nneed to warm up for three or four weeks\nup to like get back into speed right and\nI remember that I started to feel like\num that my right uh the soul of my right\nfood was a little bit like bothering me\nlike but like almost imperceptible and I\nwas like no you know you just can't you\njust have to keep going you know and my\nwife elain told me like H you know you\nshould pay attention take a break you\nknow and I just kept running and I\nremember specifically that one time I\nwent to run and say like I can put I can\nput in 80 miles that I think that I was\nrunning at like 7 Minutes 7:15 a mile or\nsomething like that and uh I began\nrunning it and I I after a mile I was\nfeeling pumped you know uh two miles\nthree miles I was like and then I\nusually will go and do four miles and\nthen turn around and come back I got a\nmile mile four and I fell crack and I\ncouldn't not walk anymore uh there was a\nhair fracture that is almost\nimperceptible in an x-ray but Bo that\nyou cannot move your foot anymore I had\nto limp for four miles all the way back\nto the car uh because I didn't even have\nmy phone and I H never forgot that uh\nfor next time um you got to pay\nattention to your body you know your\nbody is simply telling you like uh\nsomething is a little bit off just don't\nkeep pushing it you know and I I\nspecifically remember because I kept\nrunning and and I couldn't I had to\nliterally limp all the way back to the\ncar you know well Diego um I must say\nthat among the many things that you've\nshared with us today and taught us about\nthe gut and its ability to influence the\nbrain um and the incredible things that\nare happening at the level of biology\nand physiology of the gut um Chief among\nthem is the message that we should all\npay more attention to our sensing at the\nlevel of our gut and nowadays we hear so\nmuch about the gut microbiome such that\nfortunately I think most people are\nstarting to appreciate that the gut\nmicrobiome is vital for all aspects of\nhealth and that there are things that we\ncan do to feed that microbiome fiber\nintake fermented food intake and so\nforth but clearly based on what you've\ntold us today that even just paying a\nlittle bit more attention to what our\ngut is telling us at the level of\nfeeling Good Feeling less good because\nthe signs and signals are subtle I\nrealize can really help us make better\ndecisions and help us um decide not just\nwhat foods to eat or not eat how much to\neat or not eat but um also how to\nnavigate higher order decisions if you\nwill um about who to spend time with\nwhat to do what not to do moving along\nthe decision tree of life and along\nthose lines I I want to thank you for\nmaking the decision to come here here\ntoday uh I certainly um am happy that we\ndecided to do it it's something that's\nbeen a long time coming I really see you\nas one of the true Pioneers in this area\nof trying to dissect the understanding\nof the gut brain axis heal the brain\nthrough the gut understand and modulate\nour emotions uh at the level of gut\nsensing and while there are other\nresearchers in this area um I refer to\nyou as a Pioneer because you've really\nundergone this incredible trajectory\nfrom the Amazon through nutrition\nscience into neuroscience and now we're\ngetting a little bit into psychological\nscience and I'm excited for what comes\nnext I only ask uh one thing which is\nthat as you make these discoveries that\nyou come back and talk to us about them\nuh so that uh we can learn more about\nyour incredible work so Andrew I want to\nsay h a few things the first thing is\nthat I I feel deeply honored by uh your\ninvitation and thank you so much for uh\nthe opportunity I I am just simply uh\nrepresentative of uh the people that uh\nwork uh with me and uh work uh with us\nyou know I'm just an an ambassador and\nthey get the majority of the credit for\ntheir dedication to help us understand a\nlittle bit more uh of uh the body and\nhow it is help us to navigate the world\nthat we live in so I want to thank uh\nyou for the opportunity I want to thank\nuh the people that have made this\npossible also like um the people that\nare along the way or the institutions\nthat are along the way uh have a help\nfund this um Endeavor you know my home\ninstitution at du I'm deeply grateful\nbecause my career has developed there uh\nand uh some of my mentors Roger little\nAndrew mure and the people that have\nhelped me along the way and then finally\nI want to thank uh you\nuh and your your team uh and\ncongratulate you for uh the work that\nyou do and that you have created this uh\nwindow for uh us to come and share with\nthe public uh some of the a little bit\nof the the work that we do uh perhaps uh\nsome of that is uh is obviously is based\non uh evidence uh some portion of that\nis thinking about the future uh but I do\nthink that through maintaining the\ndialogue with the public uh that we can\ncontinue to understand the world that we\nlive in and for that I I have to thank\nyou for uh having creating this platform\nwell it's a labor of love and I'm uh\nhonored to uh be able to do it and um in\nno small part because I get to sit down\nand have uh beautiful intimate\nconversations about biology and life\nwith you so thank you so much thank you\nthank you for joining me for today's\ndiscussion about
