    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are\ndiscussing caffeine.\nCaffeine is one of the\nmost widely used substances\non the planet.\nEstimates are that more than\n90% of adults and as many as 50%\nof kids that is\nadolescents and teenagers\nuse caffeine on a daily basis.\nCaffeine is an amazing molecule.\nMost people are familiar\nwith caffeine's ability\nto increase alertness and\nto reduce our feelings\nof sleepiness and fatigue.\nAnd indeed, it does that.\nBut what most people\nare not aware of\nis that caffeine acts\nas a strong reinforcer.\nWhat I mean by reinforcer\nis that, when caffeine\nis present in a drink or food--\nand yes, indeed, caffeine\nis present in many foods\neven unbeknownst to us.\nWhen it's present\nin drinks and foods,\nwe actively come to like those\nfoods and drinks more than\nif caffeine were not contained\nin those foods and drinks.\nSo it reinforces our liking of\nparticular foods and drinks.\nAnd indeed, it even\nreinforces our liking\nof the containers\nthey are consumed from\nand the company we keep when we\nconsume foods and drinks that\ncontain caffeine.\nThat is, caffeine is\nnot just a stimulant.\nCaffeine is a reinforcer.\nAnd it's a reinforcer that\nplays an active role in almost\neverybody's daily life.\nWe can say that with confidence\nbecause, as I mentioned\na moment ago, more than 90% of\npeople are consuming caffeine.\nAnd most people think that they\nconsume caffeine because it\nmakes them feel more alert.\nBut there are many reasons\nwhy you're consuming caffeine.\nAnd I'm not going to tell you\nthat consuming caffeine is\nnecessarily bad.\nIn fact, today, I'm going\nto tell you about many\nof the positive health\nbenefits of caffeine,\nincluding\nneuroprotective effects,\nantidepressive\neffects, and certainly\nperformance-enhancing effects,\nboth for mental performance\nand for physical performance.\nNow that said, there are\ncertain situations in which you\nwant to avoid caffeine, and\nthere are certain people who\nmight opt to avoid caffeine.\nThat's especially the case\nwhen one thinks about caffeine\nnot just as a stimulant\nbut as a reinforcer.\nIn fact, caffeine is\nsuch a strong reinforcer\nthat, if even tiny\namounts of caffeine\nare present in certain\nfoods and drinks,\nyou will very quickly\ncome to prefer those foods\nand drinks over\nother choices, which\ncan be a good thing\nor a bad thing,\ndepending on what sorts\nof food and drink choices\nyou're trying to make.\nSo today, I'm\ngoing to inform you\nabout how caffeine works\nat a mechanistic level.\nI promise to do\nthat with a minimum\nof nomenclature and such\nthat, even if you don't have\na background in\nbiology, you will\nbe able to digest that\ninformation easily.\nAnd then I'll tell you how to\nuse caffeine to your advantage\nor conversely how to avoid\ncaffeine at certain times\nto your advantage.\nSo today's episode will focus\nboth on mechanisms and tools\nthat is the use and\nleverage of caffeine\nto improve mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nBefore we go any further\ninto today's discussion,\nI want to tell you about some\nrecent results about a molecule\nthat's found in certain\ncaffeinated beverages\nand that has been proven to\nbe very useful for both weight\nloss, mental performance, and\ncontrolling blood sugar levels.\nAnd that's GLP-1 or\nglucagon-like peptide 1.\nGlucagon-like peptide 1 is\nfound in the brain and body.\nIt acts both on\nthe brain and body.\nIt does many different things.\nBut one of its primary\neffects that's been discovered\nis to reduce hunger.\nAnd it does that in two ways.\nIt does that by\nactivating certain neurons\nin your hypothalamus.\nSo that's a brain region that\ncontrols hunger and satiety.\nIt makes us feel full at\nthe level of the brain,\nso it makes us feel\nsated, that is.\nAnd it actually\nmakes us feel full.\nIt turns out that GLP-1 acts\non certain receptors in the gut\nto make us feel as if\nwe've ingested enough food.\nIt doesn't necessarily\nmake us feel\nas if our gut is distended,\nbut it makes us feel full.\nThat's really interesting\nbecause, if you\nthink about it, when we eat,\nour stomach fills up, obviously.\nAnd that information has to be\ncommunicated to the brain such\nthat the brain can then send\nsatiety signals that actually\nshut off our hunger.\nAnd believe it or not,\nthe brain actually\nactivates signals\nto reduce the desire\nto chew when our\nstomach is full.\nAnd GLP-1, as I mentioned,\nworks on the brain\nto create these feelings of\nsatiety as if we've had enough\nand to reduce our\ndesire to eat more.\nAnd GLP-1 acts\ndirectly on the gut\nto give us a slight sense of\nfullness in the gut, which then\nis communicated to the brain.\nSo really, there are\ntwo parallel signals\nbeing sent when we have\nGLP-1 present in our system.\nNow a little bit of\nrelevant history on GLP-1.\nIt was actually discovered\nin Gila monsters.\nThese are these reptiles that\ncan go long periods of time\nwithout eating.\nAnd a very clever\nscientist decided\nto study why it is that certain\nanimals like Gila monsters\ncan go a long period of time\nwithout ingesting anything.\nAnd it's because they produce\nvery large amounts of GLP-1.\nThey isolate the\npeptide from GLP-1,\nthen they looked for the\nanalogous peptide in humans.\nAnd it turns out\nthat does exist.\nAnd as I mentioned, it's\nreleased in both brain and body\nto make you feel full and sated.\nWhy am I telling you all this?\nWell, today we're going\nto talk about caffeine.\nAnd there's one particular\ncaffeine source,\nwhich is yerba maté, and there\nare some other forms of teas\nsimilar to yerba mate that\nstimulate the release of GLP-1\nsignificantly.\nThere are also nowadays drugs\nwhich are called analogues\nof GLP-1.\nSo these are drugs\nthat mimic or are\nidentical to the kind of\nGLP-1 that you would make.\nAnd those drugs are proven\nto be very effective\nfor the treatment of\ncertain forms of diabetes\nand for the\ntreatment of obesity,\nbut they trigger\nenormous amounts\nof GLP-1 pathway activation.\nSo those are extreme cases\nfor people that are really\nstruggling for weight loss.\nBut the clinical trials and\nthe data that are out there\nin the general\npopulation now are very,\nvery promising for\nGLP-1 analogues.\nYerba maté tea, provided\nit's not the smoked variety--\nand I mention that because a\nnumber of people have cued me\nto the fact that yerba maté\nteas come in smoked varieties\nand nonsmoked varieties.\nAnd the smoked\nvarieties are thought\nto perhaps be carcinogenic.\nThat is, procancer-causing.\nSo I advise people to avoid\nsmoked varieties of yerba maté\ntea.\nBut yerba maté teas are known\nto stimulate significant amounts\nof GLP-1 release.\nAnd so they can be effective\nas a weight loss tool,\nmainly by blunting appetite.\nAnd again, they do that both\nat the level of the brain\nand at the level of the gut.\nNow all of what I\njust told you has\nbeen known for some\nperiod of time,\nbut there are new set of\nfindings that were just\npublished in Cell Reports\nMedicine, Cell Press\njournal, excellent journal--\nwhich indicate exactly\nhow it is that GLP-1\nstimulates both satiety and\ncan trigger additional weight\nloss through other mechanisms.\nAnd I find the mechanism to be\nreally interesting and actually\nreally important, given\nsome other topics we've\ncovered on this podcast before.\nSo the basic finding\nis that GLP-1,\nwhether or not it's stimulated\nthrough the release of analogue\ndrug that one is prescribed\nor by drinking yerba maté tea,\nfor instance, and stimulate\nrelease of your own so-called\nendogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes\nyou feel more full at the level\nof brain and body.\nBut it turns out it also\nstimulates thermogenesis.\nNow thermogenesis is\nthe active utilization\nof more metabolic energy.\nAnd fat cells, in particular--\nso-called beige and brown fat\ncells--\nare a potent source of\nthermogenic activity\nin your body.\nThe basic background is that\nyou have white adipose cells, so\nwhite fat cells.\nYou have beige fat cells,\nand you have brown fat cells.\nAnd the beige and brown\nones are fat cells\nthat you actually want more of.\nThey are not abundant\nunder your skin.\nThey're abundant really\naround your clavicles\nand your upper neck.\nThey are the ones\nthat generate heat.\nAnd the beige and\nbrownness of them\nis actually the consequence of\nhaving a lot of mitochondria\nin those cells.\nWhen GLP-1 is elevated\nin your system,\nit turns out that\nit communicates\nto those white fat cells\nand helps convert them\ninto beige and brown fat cells.\nThat is, it takes fat\ncells that are not\ndoing anything useful for you\nexcept being stored energy.\nAnd I think most\npeople out there\nwould like to have fewer of\nthose white adipose cells.\nThere are few of you\nout there that actually\nneed more of them that\nare too thin, too lean,\nbut most people are suffering\nfrom having too many\nof these white adipose cells.\nWell, when you ingest yerba maté\ntea or you were to take a GLP-1\nanalogue or stimulate GLP-1 in\nany number of different ways,\nyes, you stimulate\nincreased satiety,\nbut you're also stimulating the\nconversion of these white fat\ncells into beige\nand brown fat cells,\nwhich makes you more thermogenic\nand over time raises your basal\nmetabolic rate.\nSo you're burning more\ncalories even at rest.\nIt also makes you\nfeel as if you're\nmore comfortable in colder\nenvironments at rest.\nThis is very much the same\nas the mechanism that's\ninduced when you were to,\nsay, take a cold shower\nor do regular ice baths or\nget into cold water regularly.\nThat, too, stimulates the\nconversion of white fat cells\nto beige and brown fat cells.\nSo I like these\nfindings very much\nbecause they provide a\nmechanistic coherence.\nThey provide that is a\nreally nice story as to how\nsomething like GLP-1 could be\nso effective for weight loss.\nYes, on the one hand,\nGLP-1 is reducing appetite,\nand that, of course, will help\npeople maintain or lose weight.\nBut it's also increasing\nbasal metabolic rate.\nAnd we now know how\nthat's accomplished.\nIt's likely accomplished\nat least through this one\nmechanism by the\nstimulation of conversion\nof these white fat cells,\nwhich don't do much for us\nexcept as energy storage\nunits to these metabolically\nmitochondrial-rich beige\nand brown fat cells,\nwhich you can think of as\nsort of the oil in the candle\nthat allows your furnace, your\nmetabolism to burn at a higher\ntemperature and a higher rate.\nSo that's the mechanism.\nAnd the basic tool\ntakeaway is that,\nif you are somebody who's\ninterested in losing weight\nand you want to leverage\nthe GLP-1 pathway,\ndrinking a cup or two of yerba\nmaté tea early in the day would\nbe a great way to\nstimulate GLP-1 release.\nThere are other ways to\nstimulate GLP-1 release.\nYou can get it through\ncertain forms of exercise.\nIn particular, fasted exercise.\nThis is actually a vote in\nfavor of fasted exercise.\nThere's a debate as\nto whether or not\nfasted cardio burns more\nfat than nonfasted cardio.\nAnd the data basically say\nno, it doesn't really matter.\nBut that doesn't really\ntake into account\nthe longer arc of things\nlike GLP-1 release,\nso that needs to be\ntaken into consideration.\nSo you could do fasted cardio.\nYou could drink yerba maté tea,\nkeeping in mind that yerba maté\ntea does contain caffeine.\nWe'll talk more about the\nspecific forms of stimulants\nincluding caffeine\nthat maté has.\nBut maté would be a great way\nto stimulate GLP-1 release.\nAnd then, of course, for those\nof you that are interested\nin more robust\nactivation of GLP-1,\nthen perhaps you might want\nto consider some of the new\nprescription GLP-1 analogues\nthat are out there.\nBut that's a more severe\nstimulus for GLP-1, of course.\nAnd for everybody, regardless\nof whether or not you're trying\nto lose weight, gain\nweight, or maintain weight,\nI think we're going to be\nhearing a lot more about GLP-1\nanalogues and drinks and\nsupplements and things of that\nsort that stimulate GLP-1 in\nthe very near future because it\ndoes appear to be a very\nimportant biological mechanism.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\nLevels is a program\nthat lets you\nsee how different foods affect\nyour health by giving you\nreal-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose\nmonitor.\nThe blood glucose or blood\nsugar is a critical aspect\nof your immediate and\nlong-term health and, indeed,\nyour feelings of vigor and\nmental clarity and well-being\nat any moment.\nOne of the key things is to know\nhow different foods and food\ncombinations and\ntiming of food intake\nis impacting blood glucose.\nAnd with Levels,\nyou're able to assess\nall of that in real time.\nI tried Levels,\nand what it taught\nme, for instance, was that\nI can eat certain foods\nat certain times of day.\nBut if I eat them at\nother times a day,\nI get a blood sugar crash.\nIt also taught me,\nfor instance, how\nto space my exercise\nand my food intake.\nTurns out for me exercising\nfasted is far more beneficial.\nThat's something I\nlearned using Levels,\nand it's completely transformed\nnot just the spacing and timing\nof my diet and\nexercise but also use\nof things like the sauna\nand other activities.\nIt's been a tremendous\nlearning for me\nthat's really shaped an enormous\nnumber of factors in my life\nthat have led to me feeling\nfar more vigorous with far more\nmental focus and physical\nstrength and endurance.\nSo if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\ngo to

capacity.\nI've talked many\ntimes on this podcast\nabout the critical relationship\nbetween sleep and body\ntemperature.\nThat is, in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep\nthroughout the night,\nour body temperature\nneeds to drop by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd conversely, when we\nwake up in the morning,\nthat is in large part\nbecause of our body\nheating up by 1 to 3 degrees.\nNow people have different\ncore body temperatures,\nand they tend to run colder or\nhotter throughout the night.\nEight Sleep allows you\nto adjust the temperature\nof your sleeping\nenvironment so that you\nhave the optimal temperature\nthat gets you the best night's\nsleep.\nI started sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover about eight months\nago, and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nI sleep so much deeper.\nI wake up far less during the\nmiddle of the night, if at all.\nAnd I wake up feeling far\nbetter than I ever have even\nafter the same amount of sleep.\nIf you want

sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford.\nAnd everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with\nperformance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology, the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that\nyour visual system has\nto contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges in order\nfor you to see clearly,\nfor instance, when you move\nfrom a sunny area\nto a shady area\nand back again, whether or not\nyou're looking at something up\nclose or often to the distance.\nROKA understands the\nbiology of the visual system\nand has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses\naccordingly, so you always\nsee with perfect clarity.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially\ndesigned for activities\nsuch as running and cycling.\nAnd indeed, they are\nvery lightweight.\nMost of the time I\ncan't even remember\nthat they're on my face.\nThey're so lightweight.\nBut the important thing to\nknow about ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses is\nthat, while they\ncan be used during\nsports activities,\nthey also have a\nterrific aesthetic,\nand they can be used just as\nwell for wearing to work or out\nto dinner, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA.\nThat's R-O-K-A.com and enter the\ncode Huberman to

the supplements we\ndiscuss on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, you can go to\nlivemomentous, spelled O-U-S,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nHuberman.\nAnd I should just\nmention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about caffeine.\nSo as I mentioned\nearlier, caffeine\nis consumed by basically most\nall adults every single day\nand consumed at very\nregular times each day.\nIn fact, if you were to take\na look at your caffeine intake\nor the caffeine intake\nof somebody close\nto you, what you\nwould realize is\nthat they don't do so well if\ntheir caffeine intake arrives\neven 10, 20, or 30 minutes past\ntheir expected or usual intake\nof caffeine.\nThat's pretty\nremarkable, and it brings\nto mind ideas that\nwe are all, quote\nunquote, \"addicted to caffeine\"\nor that caffeine is somehow\nbad.\nI'm certainly not going to make\nthe argument that caffeine is\nbad.\nFirst of all, I'm a\nregular caffeine user.\nI wouldn't call myself\na caffeine abuser,\nbut I am a regular\ncaffeine user.\nAnd caffeine is known to\nhave certain health benefits.\nI listed off a few\nof them earlier,\nbut I'll mention those again\nnow before going forward.\nCaffeine is known to have\ncertain neuroprotective\neffects.\nAnd that is because\nof its ability\nto increase neuromodulators,\nsuch as dopamine,\nbut also other\nso-called catecholamines\nlike norepinephrine.\nIf you don't know\nwhat those names mean,\nthese are molecules that\nincrease levels of alertness,\nmotivation, and drive.\nAnd so then therefore not\nsurprisingly the large scale\nanalyses of the relationship\nbetween depression and caffeine\nshows that, provided people are\nnot drinking so much caffeine,\nthat it makes them\noverly anxious,\nthat regular intake of\ncaffeine is inversely related\nto levels of depression.\nSo it may have some\nantidepressant effects.\nAnd those could be\ndirect or indirect.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, you can imagine that if\npeople are ingesting caffeine\nand they are more motivated\nto do work and pursue\nquality social\ninteractions, then\nthe probability that they will\nhave depression could be lower.\nIt could also be that\nthere are direct effects\non the chemical systems\nof the brain that\nrelate to mood and well-being\nthat could offset depression.\nIt is not clear whether\nor not the effects\nof caffeine in\ncountering depression\nare direct or indirect.\nNonetheless, there's\na relationship there,\nand it's an interesting\nand positive one.\nOr I should say\nnegative correlation,\npositive effect overall on mood\nand well-being, to be exact.\nNow it's also the\ncase that caffeine\ncan improve mental performance\nand physical performance.\nThis has been demonstrated in\ntens of thousands of studies.\nI will review a few studies\non this, in particular, today.\nBut to just give\nyou a sense of how\ncaffeine works at the level\nof its timing and impact\non mental performance and\nphysical performance, when\nwe ingest caffeine,\nprovided that we don't have\na lot of food in our stomach\nand that our blood sugar isn't\nparticularly high, generally,\nwe experience an increase\nin alertness within\nabout five minutes.\nAnd that increase in\nfocus and alertness peaks\naround 30 minutes after\ningestion of caffeine\nand persists for as\nlong as 60 minutes.\nNow this is assuming that one\ntakes caffeine in pill form\nor drinks the entire\ncaffeine drink\nwithin a short period of time.\nBut a little bit\nlater, I'll talk\nabout how you can consume\ncaffeine at regular intervals\nwhile doing mental work or\nphysical work in a way that\ncan further increase\nmental performance\nand physical performance.\nBut let's just touch\non what caffeine\nintake really does\nfor mental performance\nand physical performance.\nPerhaps the most robust\nfinding across all\nof the studies\nthat I've examined\nis that caffeine reduces\nour reaction time.\nThat is, it improves\nour reaction time.\nIt doesn't make it longer.\nIt makes it shorter.\nSo for instance, in\na laboratory study\nwhere people were asked to hit\na lever every time they hear\na tone, you can greatly reduce\nthe time between the tone\nand the pressing of the lever\nif people ingest caffeine\nabout 30 minutes before\nthey do that task.\nNow that seems like\na trivial task,\nbut this is also seen in the\ndomain of sports performance\nand even in cognitive\nperformance, where\npeople have to arrive\nat a particular answer\nto a question.\nAnd the answer to\nthat question has\nto be pulled from\ntheir memory banks\nwithin their brain,\ntheir hippocampus,\nfor instance, a brain\nstructure involved in memory.\nAnd if you are asking\npeople, for instance,\nto remember the capitals of\ndifferent states or cities\nor to remember certain\nhistorical facts,\nthey will do that at\na particular rate.\nBut if they've ingested\ncaffeine within the hour prior,\ntheir ability to\nrecall that information\nis much, much better.\nThey are faster, and\nit does not appear\nthat accuracy is reduced.\nIn fact, in many cases,\naccuracy is enhanced.\nAnd that's because caffeine\nboth works on the reaction time\nsystems of the brain and body.\nI'll talk about the mechanisms\nfor that in a little bit.\nBut it also stimulates\ncertain neurotransmitters\nand so-called neuromodulators\nwithin the brain and body\nthat give the neural\ncircuits in the brain that\nare associated with\nlearning and memory a lower\nthreshold to activation.\nWhat does that mean?\nThat means that we are\nbetter able to access\nthe brain circuitry involved\nin learning and memory\nwhen we have a certain amount\nof caffeine circulating\nin our system.\nSo this makes\ncaffeine an incredible\nperformance-enhancing compound.\nAnd I could give you\ntens of thousands\nof examples of this in humans.\nBut before I do that,\nI want to just touch\non what we know about the\nexistence of caffeine in nature\nand what the existence\nof caffeine in nature\nand its effects on other\nanimals tells us about what\ncaffeine does in humans.\nBecause as I alluded to\nearlier, what caffeine is doing\nfor us is not just\nmaking us more alert,\nimproving our memory, improving\nour reaction time, and so on.\nIt's actually acting as\na powerful reinforcer\nof experience.\nAnd it's acting as not\njust a powerful reinforcer\nof the caffeine-containing\ndrink that we drink\nbut also the mug that\nit's contained in,\nplus the person that\nwe might be sitting\nacross from when we consume\nthat caffeine, and so on and so\nforth.\nIf it's a little\nbit hard for you\nto conceptualize\nwhat a reinforcer is\nand why I'm calling\nit a reinforcer,\nlet me spell it out in\nthree specific ways.\nWe often hear about\nthe word reward,\nand we think, OK, if\nwe do certain things\nand we like the outcome,\nthen those certain things\nare rewarded.\nRight?\nIf we're doing something,\nwe receive praise.\nThe praise is the reward.\nAnd therefore, we\nare more likely to do\nthat thing in the future.\nIn fact, a lot of\nparenting is like that.\nAnd a lot of life is like that.\nHowever, when we\nhear the word reward,\nwe often think about something\nthat feels good to us.\nAnd certainly, if we've worked\nhard and we get some praise,\nthat's natural for the\npraise to feel good to us.\nOr for instance, if\nwe work very hard\nand we get a certain outcome--\na trophy, a financial outcome,\na degree outcome, recognition,\net cetera-- all of those\ncan act as rewards,\nbut those are all\nconscious rewards.\nWe are aware that\nthey are happening.\nReinforcers are a little bit\ndifferent because the word\nreinforcement can apply to\nconscious rewards of the sort\nthat I just described,\nbut there are also\nmany ways in which\ncaffeine stimulates\nthe release of chemicals in our\nbody that act as reinforcers.\nBut those reinforcers\nare subconscious.\nThat is, we are\nnot aware that they\ncause this preference\nfor the activities that\ncause their release.\nSo the study I'm about\nto describe beautifully,\nI believe,\nencapsulates how is it\nthat humans came\nto consume caffeine\nand why caffeine exists in\nnature and the powerful effects\nof caffeine as a reinforcing\nagent both in animals, insects,\nand in you and me.\nAnd the title of the\npaper is \"Caffeine\nand floral nectar enhances a\npollinator's memory of reward.\"\nKeep in mind that caffeine\nis made from plants.\nSome of you will say, duh,\nbut I think some of us\ndon't realize that the reason\nwhy there is caffeine in coffee\nis because coffee\ncomes from a plant.\nIt's a coffee\nbean, certain teas,\nwhich, of course, are\nplants that people brew.\nCaffeine is contained in those\nteas, such as yerba maté.\nWell, why would this\nbitter substance-- because,\nin fact, caffeine is quite\nbitter in high concentrations.\nWhy would this bitter\nsubstance be something\nthat insects or animals\nwould want to consume at all?\nIt turns out that,\nin most plants,\ncaffeine is present in\nsmall enough quantities\nthat insects and other animals--\nand in fact, we can't actually\ntaste the caffeine.\nIf I were to give you a\nlittle bit of pure caffeine,\nyes, it would be a\nstimulant for you,\nbut you would say\nthat it tasted awful.\nIt's in a category of compounds\nthat would strongly stimulate\nthe bitter receptors\non your tongue\nand would make you\ncringe and pucker\nand essentially walk away from\nwhatever it is that contain\nthat caffeine and from\nthe experience that\ncontain that caffeine.\nWell, in nature, caffeine\nis present in very low\nconcentrations or is\nmasked by other flavors\nwithin flowers,\nbeans, and plants.\nAnd what this paper\nreally points to\nis that caffeine\nin nature is acting\nas a reinforcer for bees that\nare consuming different nectar.\nSo the way that it works\nis that bees, of course,\ngo from flower to flower, and\nthey are consuming the nectar.\nThey are bringing nectar\nand pollen back to the hive,\nand that provides critical\nnourishment for the bee colony.\nThe bees are foraging in a\nway that includes information\nabout color, in particular,\nultraviolet color, things\nthat we can't see\nbut they can see,\nbecause they have different\nphotoreceptors than we do.\nAnd what the study shows is\nthat plants and nectars that\ncontain very small\namounts of caffeine\nare the preferred\nsources of food for bees.\nAnd the study is\nbeautiful because they\nwere able to confirm that they\ncould mask the caffeine taste.\nSo they know that the\nbees are not preferring\nthe taste of caffeine.\nBut what they do is\nthey pair caffeine\nwith different food\nsources for the bees,\nthen they remove the caffeine.\nAnd what they find is that\nthe bees very strongly\nprefer flavors that\ncontain caffeine,\nnot because they could taste the\ncaffeine but rather for the way\nthat those caffeine-containing\nflavors made the bees feel.\nSo how do those\ncaffeine-containing flavors\nmake the bees feel?\nThe same way that\nthey make you and I\nfeel, a little bit\nmore alert and thereby\nable to do more work.\nFor the bee, the more\nwork is the consumption\nof more food, which then has\na further reinforcing effect.\nSo what we're really\ntalking about here\nis the fact that A, caffeine\nexists in nature, in plants.\nIt exists in concentrations that\nare very low, so low, in fact,\nthat they are not detectable to\nthe taste receptors of insects,\nand, in many cases, to the\ntaste receptors of humans.\nAnd, of course, there\ncan be high levels\nof caffeine in a plant.\nBut if the plant also\ncontains compounds\nthat mask the\nflavor of caffeine,\nwell then, those plants\nare going to essentially\nbe even stronger reinforcers\nfor the flavor of the plant, OK?\nSo now we're talking\nabout strong flavors\nplus strong neurostimulant\neffects of caffeine.\nAnd the most\nimportant point here\nis that all of these effects\nof caffeine are subconscious.\nIt is not because the bee or\nyou likes the taste of caffeine.\nIn fact, most people, when they\ntake their first sip of coffee,\nthey find it taste bitter\nand kind of noxious.\nThey don't like it.\nYou may not even remember that\nbecause it happened so long ago\nand because caffeine is\nsuch a strong reinforcer\nthat very quickly you come\nto like the taste of coffee.\nYou might even come to like\nthe feeling of your mug\nin your hand.\nYou might even come to\nlike the smell of coffee\nand so on and so forth.\nAnd that's because\ncaffeine stimulates\nthe release of certain\nneurochemicals in the brain,\nin particular, dopamine\nand acetylcholine,\ntwo neuromodulators\nthat increase our focus\nand alertness and our\nfeelings of well-being.\nA little bit later,\nI'll tell you\nthat caffeine stimulates\nthe release of dopamine\nin a way that's\nvery much distinct\nfrom the classical\ndopamine pathway associated\nwith addiction and reward.\nIn fact, we can\nthink of caffeine\nas having a somewhat privileged\naccess to the reward systems.\nI'll give you a bit of a\nhint of where this is going.\nCaffeine stimulates the release\nof dopamine and acetylcholine\nnot within the classic so-called\nmesolimbic reward pathway.\nThat's just fancy nerd\nspeak for the reward\npathways of the brain.\nThey're associated with\nthings like sex and food\nand drugs of abuse, like\ncocaine and methamphetamine.\nBut rather, caffeine\nseems to stimulate\nthe release of dopamine in\nthe parts of the brain that\nare associated with\nalertness and cognition,\nmeaning the forebrain.\nThis is very important.\nWe have multiple dopamine\nsystems in the brain and body,\nand caffeine seems to\nstimulate dopamine directly\nwithin the components of the\nbrain that are associated\nwith clarity of\nthought and well-being,\nbut more so clarity of thought.\nNow, I'm also talking\nabout caffeine\nas a strong reinforcer in that\nit makes you feel good overall.\nAnd it does.\nAnd that suggests that it\nalso taps into the more\nclassic reward pathway.\nBut it does that in a very\ninteresting and frankly almost\ndiabolical way.\nWhen we regularly\ningest caffeine,\nit stimulates the increase\nin dopamine receptors\nat multiple sites throughout\nthe brain but, in particular,\nwithin the reward\npathways of the brain.\nSo not the areas\nof the brain that\nare associated with focus\nand clarity of thought\nand cognition.\nIt does that, but it\nis also increasing\nthe level of dopamine receptors\nin the reward pathway.\nAnd what that means is that,\nfor any dopamine that's\nreleased in response to\na positive experience,\nsocial experience, or any\nnumber of the other things\nthat can stimulate\ndopamine release,\nthere are more receptors,\nmore parking spots,\nif you will, for that\ndopamine to arrive at\nand to exert its increases in\nmood, increases in motivation,\nand overall feelings of\ndrive and excitement.\nSo there are four ways\nthat caffeine works\nthat we need to understand.\nFirst of all, caffeine acts\nas a reinforcing agent.\nIt increases the\nprobability that you\nwill return to and engage\nin a certain activity\nor consume a certain\nbeverage or food.\nSecond of all,\ncaffeine increases\ndopamine and\nacetylcholine, which\nare both neuromodulators\nin the forebrain, which\nhelps us improve our ability to\nthink, to modify our rule sets.\nThat is, to adjust\nour strategies\nfor different social\nsituations and mental demands\nand physical demands.\nAnd third, it increases\nthe number and efficacy\nof dopamine receptors in the\nreward pathways of the brain.\nThat is, it makes things\nthat would feel pretty good\nfeel even better.\nAnd fourth, caffeine\nacts as an antagonist\nto adenosine, which offsets\nthe sleepiness that we would\notherwise feel from the\naccumulation of adenosine that\noccurs as we are awake\nfor more and more hours\nthroughout the day.\nSo let's talk first\nabout caffeine\nas a reinforcing agent.\nAgain, this was first most\nbeautifully demonstrated\nin this study on honeybees\nwhere the bees prefer\nnectars that contain caffeine.\nAnd that all makes\nperfect sense in terms\nof the ecology of bees and\nflowers that contain nectar.\nThere's an advantage, at\nleast in terms of adaptation,\nthat the flower benefits because\nof distribution of things\nfrom the flower, which is good\nfor the flowers and the bees\nbenefit, because\nthey're getting food.\nAnd so there's a kind\nof a symbiosis there.\nBut with humans, we're consuming\ncaffeine-containing beverages\nfor our sake.\nI don't think we\nhave it in mind,\nnor do the bees have\nit in mind, frankly,\nthat we're trying to\npreserve the plants that\nprovide the caffeine.\nI think we would all suffer,\nor I should say 90% of adults\nwould suffer greatly if all\nthe caffeine-containing coffee\nand tea plants were\ngone, certainly.\nBut most of us are not\nconsuming coffees and teas\nand caffeine-containing\nfoods because we're\nthinking about the\nplants they come from\nand we want to\nhelp those plants.\nWe're thinking about how\nwe want to help ourselves.\nAnd yet the point of the\nreinforcing effects of caffeine\nare that they are\nlargely subconscious.\nWe are not aware of them.\nNow you might say,\nno, that's not true.\nWhen I drink caffeine, it\nmakes me feel really good.\nSo I'm aware that it\nmakes me feel good.\nIn order to illustrate how\nreinforcement really works,\nlet me give you the\ncounter example, which\nwould be an aversive agent.\nSo we have reinforcing agents\nand we have aversive agents.\nLet's say that there were\ncompounds in nature that exist\nin plants that are aversive.\nAnd indeed, they are.\nAnd let's say that\nthese compounds\nwere present at such\nlow concentrations\nthat you couldn't taste them.\nLet's say you wake\nup in the morning\nand you go to your\nrefrigerator and you open it up\nand you are thirsty,\nand so you reach\nfor a nice rich red-containing\nbeverage in a glass jar.\nMaybe it looks like\ncranberry juice or something\nof that sort.\nOr even a nice clear\nglass of water.\nIt looks like a jug of\nwater or a glass of water,\nand you drink that.\nTaste fine to you.\nMaybe even tastes great to you.\nAnd then let's say\nabout 30 minutes later,\nyou feel a little queasy,\nyou feel a little off,\nyou feel like going\nback to sleep,\nyou just don't feel very good.\nYou don't know why,\nbut your nervous system\nis a predictive machine, and it\nhas a process in which it back\nintegrates.\nOr I should say\nintegrates backwards\ninto your immediate experience\nthat preceded that not so\ngood feeling.\nWe can reliably say that there\nis a much lower probability\nthat the next day\nwhen you wake up\nthat you would reach\nfor that same beverage\nor for that same container even.\nAnd maybe if you're in\na novel environment,\nmaybe you're staying in an\nAirbnb or a hotel or something\nof that sort, you might even\nfind that you don't really\nlike the kitchen in which\nyou consume that beverage\nin the first place.\nAnd you don't know why.\nAnd unless you got very,\nvery sick the day before,\nit's unlikely that you would\nhave such a strong response\nthat you would entirely avoid,\nfor instance, water or glass\njars containing\nliquids, et cetera.\nLet's say you went back\nto the refrigerator\nand you consume a beverage\nagain and you just\ndidn't feel so well,\nyou felt less good\nthan you normally would.\nWell, even without\nany ability to taste\nwhat's in that beverage and\neven without any understanding\nof what was happening to\nyou at a conscious level,\nthere is a very,\nvery high probability\nthat you will avoid drinking\nthat particular beverage\nand certainly at that location\nand in the same volume\nin the subsequent days.\nThat's just the way that\naversive agents work.\nAnd they work by way\nof activating neurons\nin the gut that communicate with\nareas in the brain that give us\nthis feeling of queasiness.\nAnd for some of\nyou hearing this,\nthat pathway and\nthat association\nwith times in which you felt\nqueasy and as if you wanted\nto vomit is so powerful that\nyou might even be feeling\nsome of that symptomology now.\nFor certain people that's going\nto be increased salivation\nwhich precedes vomiting,\nwe know that there's\na class of neurons\nin the brain relate\nto an area called area postrema\nthat actually stimulates\nvomiting.\nAnd if I keep\ntalking about this,\nI'll probably feel\nlike I want to vomit,\nso I'm going to move on\nfrom this in a moment.\nSo when we ingest\ncaffeine-containing beverages\nand foods, it's the\nexact opposite scenario\nas to what I just described.\nCaffeine, as a\nreinforcer, makes us\nfeel slightly better\nor a lot better\nin the immediate minutes and\nhours after we ingest it.\nSo it's acting as\na reinforcing agent\nnot just while you are under\nthe effects of caffeine\nbut for the things that preceded\nthe ingestion of caffeine,\nwhich is why you\nreturn again and again\nto caffeine-containing\nbeverages, such as coffee\nand tea or maybe even foods\nthat contain caffeine,\neven if the taste of those\nfoods is not something\nthat you would otherwise\nconsider, especially delicious.\nIn fact, most people when they\ntake their first sip of coffee\nor tea or other\ncaffeine-containing beverage,\nthey find it to be very bitter.\nAnd that's not because\nof the taste of caffeine.\nIt's because of the taste of\nthe beverage itself independent\nof caffeine.\nHowever, when caffeine\nis present in there,\nthey come to prefer that\ntaste over most all tastes.\nIn fact, they will, as\nI mentioned earlier,\nwill invest a lot of financial\nresources and time and energy\nto make sure that they\nget that beverage.\nWhat they're trying to make sure\nis not that they get that taste\nbut that they get the caffeine.\nIt is that positively\nreinforcing.\nAnd the taste therefore takes on\nnew significance, new meaning,\nand we come to associate\nit as positive.\nAnd in fact, most of\nus, including myself,\nlove the taste of espresso,\nlove the taste of coffee,\nlove the taste of yerba maté\neven if the initial taste,\nthe very first time that\nwe consume that beverage,\nwas either neutral or negative.\nAnd that is all because of\nthe reinforcing properties\nof caffeine.\nAnd then, of course, there\nare the more direct actions\nof caffeine.\nThat is, the faster\nactions of caffeine.\nAnd just to list those off\nagain very briefly so that you\nhave them in mind going\nforward, caffeine also\nincreases the release of\ndopamine and acetylcholine,\nboth of which are\nneuromodulators\nin the forebrain, which\nincreases clarity of thought\nand your ability to rule\nswitch, your ability\nto move from one\ncontext to another\nand change and understand\nthe rules of engagement,\nsocial engagement, physical\nengagement, mental engagement,\nand so forth.\nAnd as I mentioned\nbefore, caffeine also\nincreases the number of\ndopamine receptors in the reward\npathway, such that any good\nthing that happens to you.\nAny positive experience\nthat you have\nwill have a more potent effect\non your feelings of well-being.\nAnd last but certainly\nnot least, caffeine\nacts as an adenosine antagonist.\nIt reduces your feelings\nof lethargy and fatigue\nand your desire to\nsleep by parking\nin the receptors for\nadenosine and not\nallowing adenosine to have\nits pro-sleepy, if you will,\neffects on your brain and body.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of Vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticsgreen.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof Vitamin D3K2.\nI'd like to just briefly\ntalk about adenosine and some\nof its molecular features.\nAnd again, if you don't have\na background in biology,\ndon't worry.\nI promise to make this\nvery clear to everyone.\nFirst of all, caffeine is\nwhat's called a methylxantine.\nIt's a plant alkaloid.\nThat's why caffeine\nitself is very bitter.\nAgain, if I were to give\nyou just the tiniest\nlittle bit of pure\ncaffeine, you would find\nit to be extremely aversive.\nSo these plants that have\nsnuck small enough amounts\nof caffeine into\nthem or that have\nmasked the flavor of\ncaffeine with other flavors\nsuch that bees and humans\nwant to consume them,\nwhile we don't know what\nplants think, it does\nseem very diabolical\nand very clever\nin that we are seeking out these\ncaffeine-containing plants,\nbeverages, and foods even\nthough caffeine itself\nis this alkaloid that\nis very, very bitter.\nMethylxantine--\nthat is caffeine--\nbinds to adenosine receptors.\nAnd there are really two\ntypes of adenosine receptors.\nThere are these so-called A1\nreceptors and the A2 receptors.\nAnd they are present in\ndifferent parts of the brain\nand body at different levels.\nWe don't have to get too\nfar into receptor subtypes.\nMore importantly\nto understand is\nthat adenosine makes us feel\ntired because of the way\nthat it taps into\nthe ATP pathway.\nThe ATP pathway is central to\nenergy production and feelings\nof overall energy in\nour brain and body\nin all cells and organ systems.\nWhen caffeine binds to\nadenosine receptors,\nit prevents adenosine\nfrom breaking down\ncertain components of the\nenergy production pathway.\nAnd the net consequence of\nthat is increased cyclic AMP.\nSo basically, when\nwe ingest caffeine,\nwe are biasing\nour system towards\nthe pro-energetic aspects\nof these cellular pathways.\nNow it's really important to\nunderstand that, in biology,\neven if you block a\nreceptor or you prevent\nthe activity of an enzyme and--\nat least, in this\ncase, you end up\nwith more cyclic\nAMP, more energy.\nYou're not really\ngetting more energy.\nYou're actually borrowing\nenergy against an overall system\nthat is frankly nonnegotiable.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, let's say that you were\nto wake up after six or eight\nhours of sleep and to\ndrink a lot of caffeine\nand keep drinking caffeine\nthroughout the day blocking\nthose adenosine receptors.\nYes, you'll offset fatigue.\nYou'll offset sleepiness\nbecause that adenosine simply\ncan't function.\nBut at the point where the\ncaffeine becomes dislodged\nfrom the adenosine\nreceptors, you\nwill have a massive glut,\na backlog of adenosine,\nand you will feel\nextra, extra sleepy.\nSo really, there's no\nway to create more energy\nin your system.\nReally, what you're\ndoing is you're\nchanging the timing in which\nthe sleepy signals and the more\nenergetic signals are arriving.\nAnd this is really important\nto understand as the backdrop\nto the various tools\nthat we're going\nto get into next, in which you\ncan use caffeine for enhancing\nmental performance and\nphysical performance\nand other aspects of health.\nBut it's very important\nto understand this concept\nthat, when you wake up in the\nmorning provided that you slept\nwell and enough\nthe night before,\nyour levels of adenosine\nwill be about as\nlow as they will ever be.\nActually, in order to get\nyour adenosine levels really\nbottomed out, you want to avoid\ncaffeine in the first 90 to 120\nminutes after waking.\nWe'll talk about why that\nis because it turns out\nthere's a way to\ncompletely clear adenosine\nout of your system in the\nhour or so after waking.\nBut for most people,\nadenosine levels\nare going to be\nclose to their lowest\nafter a good night's sleep.\nBut there's really no\nnegotiating the accumulation\nof adenosine that's\ngoing to occur\nand going to bias you towards\nfeeling more sleepy than you\nwould.\nOtherwise, that's going to\noccur throughout the day.\nThere's really no way\nto eliminate adenosine.\nAll you can really do\nis block its function.\nSo it's sort of like borrowing\nenergy against the fatigue\nthat you will inevitably feel.\nNow this actually\nhas a very important\nsocioeconomical relevance.\nBefore caffeine was regularly\nconsumed by human beings,\nwe were really slaves\nto the light/dark cycle.\nAnd this was especially\ntrue before the presence\nof artificial lighting.\nBut even before the advent\nof artificial lighting,\nhumans were largely constrained\nto the outside light/dark\ncycle.\nWe need to be active during the\nday and working during the day,\nand we need to be\nasleep at night.\nCaffeine allows us\nto divorce ourselves\nfrom that circadian cycle.\nCircadian just\nmeans about 24 hour.\nCaffeine allows us to do\nthat at least somewhat by way\nof increasing our alertness.\nThat is, spiking our\nalertness at various times\nthroughout the day\nand even at night.\nThis is how we can have\nshift workers, for instance,\nthat can sleep during\nthe day and then drink\na strong cup of\ncoffee at 8:00 PM\nand then work into the night.\nThat ability completely\ntransformed our society.\nNow, of course, the\nhealthiest schedule-- and we\nknow this with certainty.\nThe healthiest schedule\nfor brain and body\nis going to be alert during the\ndaytime and asleep at night.\nThere's no question about that.\nShift workers run into all\nsorts of health problems.\nAnd thank you shift workers\nfor doing the important work\nthat you do.\nWe need you.\nAir traffic controllers,\nparamedics, firefighters,\npolice officers, et cetera.\nBut we know that there are\nserious health consequences,\nnegative health consequences,\nthat is, for shift workers.\nBut for most people out\nthere, about 95% of people\nfollow a typical schedule.\nThey're awake during the\nday and asleep at night.\nAnd yet it used to\nbe before the advent\nof caffeine-containing\nbeverages that, if you were\nsleepy in the\nafternoon, you either\nhad to take a nap or\nbattle that sleepiness,\nthat your activity rhythms\nand your sleep rhythms were\ngoverned by these circadian\nchanges in availability\nof sunlight and when you slept.\nAnd you just didn't\nhave the ability\nto ingest a beverage\nthat would increase\nyour levels of alertness\nbecause you block adenosine.\nSo this is important\nto understand\nthat, nowadays,\nwe certainly live\nin a time in which we use--\nin fact, 90% or more of\nadults and half or more\nof adolescents and\nteenagers use caffeine\nas a way to negotiate\nwith, to borrow\nagainst this natural pattern\nof adenosine making us sleepy.\nBut again, you're\njust offsetting\nthe effects of sleepiness\nthat adenosine causes.\nYou can't eliminate\nthe adenosine entirely.\nThe important point\nis that adenosine\nas a pro-sleep molecule\nis a nonnegotiable aspect\nof your biology.\nIn fact, it's so nonnegotiable\nthat, every 24 hours, you\nare going to release\nadenosine, and you're\ngoing to release adenosine in\ndirect proportion to how long\nyou've been awake.\nSo the longer you've\nbeen awake, the more\nadenosine circulating\nin your system.\nThere are really only a handful\nof ways to completely clear out\nadenosine.\nThe major one\nbeing to get sleep.\nThe other is to take a short\nnap, which, of course, is\nsleep, but it's shallow sleep.\nOr non-sleep deep\nrest, so-called NSDR,\nhas been shown to reduce\nlevels of adenosine.\nAnd there are certain things\nsuch as viewing morning\nsunlight, which because of\nits effects on cortisol,\ncan quote unquote,\n\"clear out adenosine.\"\nWe'll talk about this in\nmore detail in a few minutes.\nAnd there's also evidence that\ncertain forms of exercise,\nprovided that it's\nbrief and intense,\ncan also reduce adenosine,\nnot just block its effects.\nNow that we've talked about some\nof the incredible mechanisms\nby which caffeine changes\nour experience of life,\nincreases alertness\nand mood, et cetera,\nI want to talk about the\nuse of caffeine as a tool.\nNow caffeine is a very\npotent and useful tool\nfor enhancing mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nBut there are certain\nconsiderations\none has to keep in mind,\nin particular, dose.\nNow, first off,\nnot everybody will\nrespond to the same dose\nof caffeine the same way,\nbut we can reliably say\nthat your body weight is\na good measure by\nwhich you can estimate\nwhat a healthy, useful\ndose of caffeine would be.\nSo for most people,\ningesting 1 to 3 milligrams\nof caffeine per\nkilogram of body weight\nis going to be the\nrange in which caffeine\ncan have positive effects\nwithout making us feel overly\nanxious and give us that\nfeeling that we're jumping out\nof our skin and\nturn the otherwise\npositive experience of\ncaffeine into an aversive one.\nFor those of you that aren't\nfamiliar with thinking in terms\nof kilograms and\nnormally think in pounds,\nI'll just quickly give you\nsome general estimations\nthat, for instance, 100\nkilograms equals 220 pounds.\nSo for me, I weigh\n100 kilograms.\nThat means that 1\nto 3 milligrams--\nagain, milligrams,\nthousandth of a gram.\n1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine\nper kilogram of body weight\nwould mean for me.\nI could safely ingest 100 to\n300 milligrams of caffeine\nin a single dose,\nin a single drink,\nif that's the way\nI'm consuming it,\nor pill form if that's the\nway that I'm consuming it.\nAnd it's very likely that\nthat will be a tolerable dose.\nHowever, if you are\nnot somebody that's\naccustomed to drinking\ncaffeine on a regular basis,\nI suggest you start on the\nlower end of that 1 to 3\nmilligrams per kilogram\nof body weight range.\nSo for instance,\nif you're somebody\nwho weighs 50 kilograms, that's\napproximately 110 pounds.\nAnd you would be\npretty comfortable\ningesting somewhere between 50\nand 150 milligrams of caffeine.\nSo what I recommend is that\npeople who are considering\nusing caffeine as a tool or who\nare already ingesting caffeine,\nstart to think about\nthe dosage of caffeine\nthat you are ingesting\nor plan to ingest\nand the timing in which\nyou ingest that caffeine\nrelative to certain tasks\nthroughout your day,\nyour waking, and your sleep.\nAnd we'll talk about\nthat in just a moment.\nBut the first step for\nyou is to figure out\nhow much you weigh\nin kilograms and then\nto go to that number of 1\nto 3 milligrams of caffeine\nper kilogram of body weight.\nAnd that's a good\nrange in which you\nmight want to explore\nthe use of caffeine\nin a single application,\nmeaning a single dose.\nNow, I do realize that\nsome people out there are\ndrinking coffee all day long\nor having coffee in the morning\nand again in the afternoon.\nWhat I'm referring to here\nis the ingestion of caffeine\nin a single bout, right?\n1 cup of coffee or 2 cups\nof coffee, for instance,\nto achieve that 100\nto 300 milligram\nrange if that's what's\nappropriate for your body\nweight.\nBut to avoid any confusion,\nwhen I talk about dosage\nof caffeine, what I'm\nreally talking about\nis not the total amount of\ncaffeine ingested per day.\nI'm talking about\nthe total amount\nof caffeine ingested in one\nsitting or setting, that is.\nAnd if you're somebody who's\ndrinking caffeine multiple\ntimes throughout the day, you\ncan imagine-- for instance,\nlet's say the\nappropriate dose for you\nin order to get an enhancement\nin mental performance\nor physical performance\nis 200 milligrams.\nAnd you are somebody who's\ndoing some work in the morning,\nand you want to have\nthat lift in the morning\nto be able to focus better.\nAnd you're doing some physical\nexercise in the afternoon\nor vice versa that you\nwould ingest 200 milligrams\nof caffeine at two\nseparate times per day\nseparated by about four hours.\nNow you don't have\nto separate them.\nYou could put them two\nhours apart, for instance.\nBut we'll talk about half-life\nof caffeine and so forth.\nJust keep in mind that, if\nyou're ingesting 200 milligrams\nof caffeine and that's the\nappropriate dose for you\nbased on your body\nweight and then you\nare ingesting another 200\nmilligrams of caffeine an hour\nlater, you are effectively\ningesting approximately 400\nmilligrams of caffeine,\nwhich is going\nto start exceeding the dose\nin which you can normally\ntolerate without feeling\nanxious and jittery.\nWith all of that\nsaid, there is a range\nof tolerance for caffeine\nthat's based on two things.\nOne is a preexisting disposition\nthat is whether or not\nyour genetics and nervous system\nand the backdrop of your life,\nhow much stress\nyou're experiencing\ntends to make you feel more\nanxious and alert and jittery\nbefore you ingest any caffeine.\nAnd the other is how so-called\ncaffeine-adapted you are.\nWe often hear about tolerance.\nTolerance means\nsomething very specific.\nIt's the ability to ingest\nmore and more of something\nwith a plateau that is a no\nincrease or an actual reduction\nin the effectiveness\nof that thing.\nBut here we're not really\ntalking about tolerance\nto caffeine.\nWhat we're talking about\nis being caffeine-adapted.\nA simple way to\nunderstand whether or not\nyour caffeine-adapted or not\nis that, if you drink caffeine\nand it tends to\nincrease your heart rate\nand make you feel more alert\nand a bit more anxious,\nthen chances are you are\nnot caffeine-adapted,\nprovided the amount of caffeine\nis within the healthy range\nfor you, that is, the ranges\nwe talked about a moment ago.\nHowever, here's somebody\nwho drinks caffeine\nand you actually feel\nalert and relaxed,\nchances are you are\ncaffeine-adapted.\nAnd so at various times\nduring today's episode,\nI'll talk about people\nwho are caffeine-adapted\nand people who are\nnot caffeine-adapted.\nWe'll talk about the use of\ncaffeine every other day.\nI know a few habitual caffeine\ndrinkers including myself,\njust the simple mention of\nthat probably sounds aversive.\nBut there is actually\ngreat utility\nto using caffeine every other\nday as opposed to every day.\nBut just keep in\nmind that some people\nwill drink caffeine and not get\nmuch of a lift from it at all.\nOther people will\ndrink caffeine,\nand they will feel extremely\nanxious even at dosages\nfar lower than that 1 to\n3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight range that\nI described a moment ago.\nSo you have to take into\naccount individual differences.\nThat said, 1 to 3 milligrams of\ncaffeine per kilogram of body\nweight for a given sitting.\nFor your morning coffee or\nyour morning yerba maté tea is\na good range from\nwhich to start.\nAnd I do encourage you\nto go online and look up\nthe various beverages and\nfoods that you might be\neating that contain caffeine.\nFor instance, some people\nare surprised to discover\nthat the coffee that they get\nfrom some of the more standard\npopular vendors out\nthere, the small coffee\nor the medium\ncoffee, for instance,\ncan contain as much as 400 to\n600 milligrams of caffeine.\nAnd the large\ncoffee that is often\nsold at those\ncommercial vendors can\ncontain as much as 1 gram,\n1,000 milligrams, of caffeine.\nNow you may be\nadapted to that such\nthat it doesn't make\nyou feel anxious,\nbut if you wonder why\nyou feel irritable\nand you get a headache\nwhen you don't\nget that caffeine or\nthat amount of caffeine\nat precisely the time that\nyou're used to getting it\neach day, that's because\nyou are consuming\nquite large quantities of\ncaffeine on a regular basis.\nSo I do recommend whether or not\nyou drink soda or coffee or tea\nthat you figure out\nthe source of that.\nOK, so figure out what\nvendor you purchase it\nfrom, what kind of coffee,\nand go online and spend\na little bit of time\nbecause the information is\nout there to discover\nwhat levels of caffeine\nyou're actually ingesting.\nNow if you happen to be\ningesting more than 1\nto 3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight of caffeine,\nthat's not necessarily bad.\nHowever, you do want to\nbe careful about ingesting\nvery high levels of caffeine\nover long periods of time\nin your life because there can\nbe issues that start to arise.\nIn particular, a bias\ntowards higher levels\nof anxiety and depletion\nof certain electrolytes.\nBecause caffeine\nis a diuretic can\ncause you to lose sodium and\nother things of that sort.\nAnd also just from simply\na dependent standpoint,\nit does appear that if you\ningest high levels of caffeine\nthat is exceeding the\ndosages that normally you\ncould get away with\nand get just as\nmuch mental-enhancing and\nphysical-enhancing benefits\nthat you can cause\nsome disruption\nto the microvasculature.\nYou can bias yourself towards\nheadaches, anxiety attacks,\nand you can become\nactually quite irritable\nwhen you're not getting those\nhigher levels of caffeine.\nSo I do encourage\nyou to figure out\nnot just what an appropriate\ncaffeine dosage would\nbe for you but also\nhow much caffeine\nyou might already be ingesting.\nThe first tool I'd\nlike to talk about\nis one that I've\nmentioned before\non this podcast several times.\nAnd it's something that\nif you haven't heard of\nwill be very useful to you.\nAnd if you have heard\nthis tool before,\nI'm going to add some\nadditional features\nto the description\nof this tool that\nshould make this\nworthwhile for you as well.\nAnd that is to delay\nyour caffeine intake\nto 90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking up on most days.\nAnd I'll be very\nclear as to days\nin which you might want\nto ingest caffeine more\nclosely to when you wake up.\nWhy would you want to delay\nyour caffeine intake to 90\nto 120 minutes after waking?\nThe answer to that\nis very simple.\nMany people wake\nup in the morning.\nThey drink caffeine within\n10, 20, 30, sometimes\nwithin 2 minutes of waking.\nAnd they feel more\nalert naturally.\nThat makes sense because\nof the effects of caffeine\nin blocking the\neffects of adenosine\nthat I talked about\nearlier and its effects\non other\nneurotransmitter systems.\nBut then what they find is\nthat, in the early afternoon,\nin particular, after lunch,\nthey experience a dramatic dip\nin their overall levels of\nenergy, the so-called afternoon\ncrash.\nAnd in most cases, the\nway they respond to that\nis to ingest more\ncaffeine, which\nindeed can increase their\nlevels of mood and alertness.\nHowever, as we'll\nsoon talk about,\nthere is a problem\nwith ingesting caffeine\nin the afternoon if it\nfalls within 8 or 10\nor dare I even say 12\nhours of going to sleep.\nAnd that is, the caffeine\ningested in the afternoon--\nfor most everybody, let's say\nfor 95-plus percent of people--\ndisrupts the\narchitecture and quality\nof their nighttime sleep.\nAnd I should say that\nit doesn't necessarily\nimpact their ability to fall\nasleep and maybe even sleep\nthrough the night but that the\ndepth and quality of that sleep\nis disrupted by consuming\ncaffeine in the afternoon.\nA little bit later,\nI'll talk about how\nyou can offset some of\nthose negative effects\nif you absolutely require\ncaffeine in the afternoon.\nBut there's a huge advantage\nto restricting your caffeine\nintake to the early\npart of your day\nbut not consuming caffeine\nwithin the first 90\nto 120 minutes after waking.\nIn fact, many people find that\nif they delay their caffeine\nintake to 90 to 120\nminutes after waking up\nthat they feel more\nalert in the morning,\nand they completely avoid\nthat afternoon crash.\nNow that said, many\npeople, including myself,\ndo need a short nap\nor non-sleep deep rest\nor other form of relaxation\nfor 10 to 30 minutes\nin the afternoon.\nThat is natural and healthy.\nI'm not referring\nto the need for that\nwhen I refer to the\nso-called afternoon crash.\nWhat I'm talking about\nin the afternoon crash\nis a inability to recover\nenergy and focus and a need\nto consume more caffeine just to\nmake it through the afternoon.\nBy delaying caffeine intake to\n90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nthere are a couple of things\nthat are accomplished.\nFirst of all, you offset\nthat afternoon crash.\nAnd this is an effect that\nmany people experience\nthe very first time they\nstart delaying their caffeine\nintake to 90 to 120\nminutes after waking.\nAnd the reason this works\nso well is the following.\nAs I mentioned\nearlier, adenosine\nis a molecule that builds up\nthe longer that we are awake.\nIt is a molecule that\nis reduced or cleared\nfrom our system by sleep.\nSo when we emerge\nfrom sleep regardless\nof how long we've slept,\nour adenosine levels\nare lower than they\nwere when we went\nto sleep the previous night.\nIf you slept well\nenough and long enough,\nthose adenosine levels\ncan be very, very low,\nbut they are never\ncompletely zero.\nWhen you wake up in\nthe morning, even\nif you're one of these people\nthat springs out of bed\nand is ready to attack the\nday-- and here I'm certainly\nnot describing myself.\nI'm not one of those people.\nI tend to wake fairly slowly.\nBut if you're one of those\nspring up and attack the day\nor you're one of\nthe people who moves\nmore slowly into your\nday, regardless, there's\nstill some residual\nadenosine in your system.\nAnd this is\nparticularly the case\nif you did not get enough\nsleep or enough depth of sleep\nthe night before.\nThe correct ratio is a slow-wave\nsleep and rapid eye movement\nsleep.\nAnd for those of you\ninterested in optimizing sleep,\nI'll just refer you to our\nmaster your sleep episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\nthe perfect your sleep episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd we have a tool kit for sleep\nall of which are available,\nzero cost, time-stamped, et\ncetera at hubermanlab.com.\nYou wake up in the morning.\nAnd your adenosine levels are\nlow, but they're not zero.\nAnd if you didn't sleep that\nwell or deeply enough the night\nbefore, you're going to have\nmore adenosine in your system.\nYou might think\nthe logical thing\nto do is therefore\nto drink caffeine\nand to block the\nadenosine that's there.\nBut what happens\nif you do that is\nthere's an accumulation, a\nsort of glut of adenosine\nthat hangs around.\nAnd then in the afternoon, when\nthe effects of that caffeine\nstart to wear off,\nyou will experience\nthe so-called afternoon crash.\nAs I mentioned\nearlier, there is a way\nto clear out the adenosine\nthat's present when you wake up\nin the morning and to\nclear it out essentially\ncompletely without just\nblocking its receptors\nand letting it accumulate\nor hang around.\nAnd the way to do that\nis to deliberately spike\nyour cortisol.\nNow, many of you have heard of\ncortisol, the so-called stress\nhormone, as a bad thing.\nAnd indeed, chronically elevated\ncortisol is a bad thing.\nIt depletes your immune system.\nIt's bad for\npsychosocial effects.\nIt tends to make us feel\nanxious and on and on.\nBut cortisol itself is not bad.\nCortisol is wonderful.\nCortisol enhances the\nefficiency of the immune system.\nIt makes us alert and focused.\nIt stimulates our metabolism.\nIt does a huge number of\npositive things, provided\nthat it is released in\na circadian fashion.\nThat is, at the\nappropriate times\nevery 24 hours and that it tends\nto peak very close to waking.\nIn fact, one of the reasons\nyou wake up in the morning,\nassuming that you weren't\nwoken up by some noise\nor sleeping in an environment\nthat's too warm, et cetera,\nis that your cortisol\nlevels start to rise.\nAnd shortly after waking,\nyour cortisol levels\nwill start to reach their peak.\nAnd when I refer to\na cortisol pulse,\nthat's just biology\nnerd speak for a rise\nand peak in cortisol.\nYou want that cortisol pulse\nto occur early in the day close\nto waking, and you want that\nfor a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, if you don't\nrestrict that cortisol pulse\nto early in the\nday, it will tend\nto bleed into the\nlater parts of the day.\nAnd actually, a late\nshifted cortisol peak\nis one of the\nhallmark signatures\nof depression,\nlow-level depression,\nand serious depression.\nAnd it can start\nto disrupt sleep\nand certainly can\ndisrupt mood metabolism\nand your immune system.\nSo you want that cortisol\npeak early in the day.\nHow do you ensure\nthat that happens?\nWell, you wake up\nin the morning.\nAnd whether or not you're\na bounce-out-of-bed type\nor you're more groggy, you kind\nof wade slowly into the day\ntype like I am, you wake up,\nand you don't ingest caffeine.\nFine and, in fact,\nbeneficial to hydrate\nwith water and electrolytes.\nTerrific.\nIn fact, I would\nsay necessary to get\nbright light in your eyes\nideally from sunlight.\nI've talked about\nthis many, many times\nbefore on the podcast.\nIf you wake up before\nthe sun comes out,\nthen turn on bright\nartificial lights.\nBut then certainly once the sun\nis out and even on cloudy days,\nin fact, especially on cloudy\ndays, get outside for anywhere\nfrom 5 to 20, maybe\neven 30 minutes.\nDo some work outside, take\nyour breakfast outside\nif you're a breakfast eater.\nGet something done outside even\nif it's just to get outside\nand get bright\nlight in your eyes.\nWhy?\nWell, because it's\nbeen shown in studies\non humans that getting\nbright light in your eyes\nin the first hour after\nwaking or as soon as possible\nafter waking increases the\npeak of that cortisol pulse\nby 50%, 5-0.\nAnd that cortisol pulse, yes,\nincreases mood, yes, increases\nalertness, but it does one\nother very important thing,\nwhich is that, through\nan indirect pathway,\nit can clear out any\nresidual adenosine that\nmight be present in your\nsystem when you wake up\nin the morning.\nAgain, this is going to be\nespecially important for those\nof you that are not\ngetting as much sleep\nor as much quality\nsleep as you would like.\nIt's going to be very important\nfor you to get that morning\nbright light ideally\nfrom sunlight,\nget that cortisol peak going.\nOther ways to increase\nthat cortisol peak\nwould be to do some\nphysical activity.\nIf you don't have time to do\na full workout, well then,\ngetting some movement--\n10 minutes of\nskipping rope or even\n5 minutes of skipping rope\nor jumping jacks or walking\nif that's all you have time\nfor ideally while getting\nthe sunlight in your eyes.\nBut that's going to zero\nout the adenosine present\nin your system.\nIf, however, you were to\nwake up and immediately\ndrink caffeine--\ncaffeine itself can\nstimulate the release\nof cortisol a little bit\nmore than it would otherwise\nbe present in your system.\nBut by blocking those\nadenosine receptors\nand because of the\nindirect effects\nof caffeine on the\ncortisol system,\nyou actually are reducing\nthe clearance of adenosine\nthat would otherwise occur.\nSo I realize that's a mouthful.\nJust to be very\nclear, if you wake up\nand you ingest\ncaffeine right away,\nyou're blocking the\nadenosine receptor,\nbut you're not clearing it out.\nYou're also preventing cortisol\nfrom having its normal increase\nand rise such that it can\ndirectly clear out adenosine\nbecause cortisol can\nclear out adenosine.\nAnd that's what you want.\nYou want to be at\nmaximum alertness\nand focus in your morning\nand throughout your day.\nAnd by delaying your caffeine to\n90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nyou set up your system so that\nyou get that morning cortisol\npeak.\nIdeally, a peak that's\neven greater because you're\ngetting your bright\nlight viewing.\nAnd then when you ingest your\ncaffeine 90 to 120 minutes\nafter waking, not only will\nyou be craving it just a little\nbit, but you will be\ndrinking that caffeine\non an already existing backdrop\nof increased alertness for two\nreasons.\nOne is adenosine is zeroed\nout, and your cortisol peak\nis higher.\nAnd so now when you\ningest caffeine,\nyou can actually ingest\nlevels of caffeine\nthat are a little\nmore reasonable that\nalmost with certainty are\ngoing to fall in this 1 to 3\nmilligrams per kilogram dosage\nand will allow you to feel\nreally alert and will\ncarry that alertness well\ninto the afternoon hours without\nthe need to drink more caffeine\nand thereby will prevent\nyou from drinking\ncaffeine and disrupting\nyour nighttime sleep.\nAnd, of course, by getting\nbetter nighttime sleep,\nyou're going to zero out\nyour adenosine even more.\nSo what I'm describing here\nare essentially two tools.\nI'm telling you to get\nmorning sunlight and maybe\nsome exercise in\nconjunction with that\neven if it's brief exercise.\nBut the main tool\nof delaying caffeine\n90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking has immediate effects,\nbut it also sets in\nmotion a cascade or domino\nfalls that lead to better\nsleep and more wakefulness\nthe next night and the next\nday and so on and so forth.\nNow I realize there are some\npeople who just simply cannot\nor will not delay their caffeine\n90 to 120 minutes after waking\nfor whatever reason.\nFirst off, let me say\nthat, if you are somebody\nwho likes to wake up and\ndo very intense exercise\nwithin the first 90\nminutes after waking, well,\nin that case, it would\nbe appropriate to ingest\nyour caffeine just prior\nto doing that exercise.\nNot a problem.\nNot a problem.\nBut you should expect that\nthe combination of drinking\ncaffeine very shortly after\nwaking plus exercising very\nintensely shortly after\nwaking will increase\nthe intensity of that early\nafternoon and afternoon fatigue\nthat you feel.\nNow for some people,\nthat's a great thing.\nThey can afford to take a nap\nor do non-sleep deep rest, step\naway from work, and so forth.\nIn that case, I\nstrongly encourage\nyou to do whatever\nit is that allows\nyou to get regular exercise\nbecause regular exercise is\ngoing to be very beneficial.\nIn fact, we did\nan entire episode\ncalled tool kit for fitness that\ndescribes a couple of different\nbut really one\nmain structure that\nallows you to get the\nappropriate amount\nof resistance training and\ncardiovascular training\nand flexibility training\nthroughout the week.\nI happen to follow that\nprogram, and it works very well.\nAnd it does involve\nsome of those workouts\nto come very early in the\nmorning shortly after waking.\nAnd in those cases,\nI do ingest caffeine\njust prior to those, so within\n10, 20 minutes of waking.\nHowever, on other\ndays, I personally\ndelay my caffeine intake\n90 to 120 minutes,\nand I've done that\nto great benefit.\nAnd most people, if not,\nall people that try that,\nhave reported the same.\nI should mention that some\npeople will find getting out\nto that 90 minutes\nto be excruciatingly\ndifficult because they're\nso accustomed to ingesting\ncaffeine close to waking up.\nIn that case, maybe just\npush out your caffeine intake\nby about 15 minutes\neach day until you\nhit that 90 to 120-minute mark.\nAnd that will make\nit much easier.\nIt might take you a\nweek or so to get there.\nBut once you get\nthere, you'll find it\nto be quite easy to maintain.\nThe other thing is that,\nif you are somebody\nwho insists on drinking caffeine\nvery shortly after waking,\nI would encourage you to drink\nhalf of your caffeine then\nand then the other half of your\ncaffeine about an hour later.\nThat also will help offset\nsome of the afternoon crash\nfor reasons related to the\nso-called kinetics of caffeine.\nCaffeine has a quarter\nlife of about 12 hours.\nThat means that if you were\nto ingest a cup of coffee\nat let's say 8:00 AM--\nand let's say 100\nmilligram coffee\njust for sake of simplicity,\nthat about 25% of that caffeine\naction--\nwe wouldn't really say 25\nmilligrams, but about 25%\nof that caffeine\naction will still\nbe present at 8:00\nPM that night,\nwhich is pretty remarkable.\nSo there's a long arc\nof caffeine effects,\nand this is why it\ncan impede sleep if we\ntake caffeine in the afternoon.\nBut again, if you're\nsomebody who wakes up\nand you really need\ncaffeine right away\nand you refuse to do this\n90 to 120-minute delay thing\nthat I'm talking about,\nwell then, in that case,\nI would drink half of\nyour caffeine upon waking\nand then a little bit more or\nthe other half about an hour\nlater.\nAnd that will extend the\narc of that caffeine effects\nsuch that you don't need\nit again in the afternoon\nbecause you won't experience\nthe afternoon crash.\nBecause of the way\ncaffeine works,\nI should mention that,\nif you ingest caffeine\non an empty stomach, it will\nhave a more potent stimulant\neffect.\nThat will also tend to increase\nthe level of jitteriness\nthat caffeine can produce.\nLater, I'll talk about ways\nto offset that jitteriness,\nbut I'll just tell\nyou one tool now.\nMany people opt to take\n100 milligrams of theanine,\nT-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, as\na way to offset some of that\njitteriness.\nTheanine will reduce\nthe jitteriness\nof caffeine, which is\nwhy many energy drink\nmanufacturers and even\nsome coffee manufacturers\nare now putting theanine\nin energy drinks\nand in ground coffee\nbecause, no surprise,\nit allows people to consume\nmore of that beverage\nand thereby purchase more\nof that beverage, which\nis what these vendors want\nwithout feeling overly\nanxious and jittery.\nSo you can take\npill form theanine\nif you want with your caffeine.\nI don't tend to do that.\nRather, I control the total\ndosage of my caffeine.\nI do tend to consume\ncaffeine on an empty stomach\nbecause I do restrict\nmy caffeine intake\nto the early part of the day.\nAnd I generally eat my first\nmeal somewhere around 11:00 AM,\nand then I generally my last\nmeal some time around 8:00\nPM or so.\nThose are averages.\nI would say plus\nor minus an hour.\nAnd that's not because\nI'm religiously\nfollowing any kind of\ntime-restricted feeding.\nIt's just that\ntends to work best\nwith my schedule\nand my appetite.\nBut again, that's\na general theme.\nThere are days in which I\nwake up and I'm very hungry,\nand I might ingest something,\nsmall snack or something.\nOr if I'm meeting\nsomebody for breakfast,\nsometimes I'll have breakfast.\nSometimes I won't.\nAnd so on and so forth.\nThe point is that\nyou can get away\nwith drinking less caffeine to\nget the stimulant effect if you\ndo it on an empty stomach.\nAnd if you're somebody\nwho likes to exercise\non an empty stomach--\nand I'm one of those people--\nwell then, ingesting caffeine\njust prior to exercise\ncan be a fantastic tool.\nA little bit later,\nwe'll talk about some\nof the physical\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine.\nBut I'll just briefly\njump to a point about that\nas we relate to\nmorning exercise.\nIf you are somebody who\nregularly ingests caffeine--\nand we can define\nregularly by, if you've\ningested caffeine every\nday for the last two weeks,\nyou're a regular\nconsumer of caffeine.\nWhereas if you're somebody\nwho only ingests caffeine\nsomewhere between two and four\ntimes per week, well then,\nyou are not a regular\nconsumer of caffeine.\nYou're an intermittent\nuser of caffeine.\nWell, if you're somebody who's\na regular user of caffeine,\nthe performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine are going\nto be most dramatic if you\ntake two or three days off from\ndrinking caffeine,\nwhich to my mind as a--\nI don't want to call\nmyself a caffeine addict\nbut a regular caffeine user.\nThat's a horrible notion to\nme, it is an aversive notion,\nbecause I do like the\neffects of caffeine so much.\nBut if you really want\nto see the maximum\nperformance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine,\nyou will do either\none of two things.\nYou will either\nabstain from caffeine\nfor a few days or three days\nprior to ingesting caffeine,\nor you will use caffeine\non an empty stomach.\nIt's very clear that\ncaffeine on an empty stomach\nenhances both the mental\nand physical enhancing\neffects of caffeine.\nAnd, of course, all of\nthat has to be stated\non the backdrop of consideration\nthat you're very, very hungry,\nit can be make it\nhard to concentrate\nand so on and so forth.\nSo I'm not encouraging people to\nstarve themselves by any means.\nCertainly, don't do that.\nBut if you want to maximize the\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine, you will consume\nit on an empty stomach.\nAnd then as a final point to\nthat, caffeine is a diuretic.\nIt causes us to lose fluid\nand, along with that fluid,\nto excrete sodium because\nof the effects of caffeine\non various processes\nwithin the kidney.\nSo one thing that works\nvery well to maintain mood\nand alertness longer given\na certain amount of caffeine\nintake and to avoid\nthe jitteriness\nand what can sometimes feel\nlike a crash or low blood sugar\nfeeling or even blurry\nvision is to make sure\nthat you consume at least\nan equal volume of water\nwith your caffeine.\nAnd ideally, that\nwater would contain\nmaybe a small pinch\nof salt or some sort\nof electrolyte drink--\nor powder, rather.\nFor me, I use element.\nFull disclosure, they are a\npodcast affiliate and sponsor.\nBut you don't need to do that.\nYou could simply just have\na glass of water alongside\nyour coffee or espresso or your\nyerba maté and just put a small\npinch of sea salt in that or\nevem just playing table salt.\nAnd that will help offset some\nof the jitteriness of caffeine.\nA lot of people think that,\nwhen they ingest caffeine,\nthey get the jitteriness and\ncrash because their blood\nsugar is low.\nAnd while that can be the\ncase, oftentimes, it's\nsimply because of the\nexcretion of sodium\nthat's occurred when\nthey've ingested caffeine.\nSo I encourage you\nto hydrate well\nand to hydrate with\nsomething that contains\na little bit of sodium.\nObviously, not so much\nthat increases hypertension\nor something of that sort\nbut a small amount of sodium\nor an electrolyte\ndrink like Element.\nAnd there are other\nelectrolyte drinks\nout there that can accomplish\nthe same, of course.\nJust a couple of\nquick notes about\ntheanine because there are\na growing number of products\nout there that contain theanine.\nAnd there's certainly a growing\nnumber of people out there\nwho are using theanine for the\neffect that I described before,\nwhich is to offset some of\nthe jitteriness associated\nwith caffeine-containing\nbeverages or foods.\nAnd, of course, I\nshould mention that I've\ntalked about the\neffects of theanine\non sleep at that sleep\ntool kit that you\ncan find as a free download.\nYou don't even have\nto sign up for.\nAnything you just download\nit from hubermanlab.com.\nGo to the menu, go\nto a newsletter.\nYou'll see the\ntool kit for sleep.\nYou'll see that the\nso-called sleep stack\nthat I use and recommend\nincludes magnesium 3 and 8,\nsomething called\napigenin and theanine,\nalthough that sleep\nstack is designed\nto be taken 30 to 60\nminutes prior to sleep.\nAnd I make the point\nthere, and I'll\nmake it again here that\ningesting theanine prior\nto sleep is not a good\nidea if you are somebody\nwho tends to have very vivid\ndreams, night terrors, or night\nwalk--\nsleepwalking, excuse\nme, et cetera.\nIn that case, eliminate theanine\nfrom the sleep stack.. .\nHowever, a number of\npeople are using theanine,\nand products are using\ntheanine to offset jitteriness\nfrom caffeine-containing\nproducts\nduring the daytime, daytime\nconsumption, that is.\nA couple of notes about\ntheanine-- theanine\nis something that is\npresent in green tea, right?\nIt's now been created\nas a supplement.\nIt's what's called a\nnonprotein amino acid.\nSo while there are amino\nacids and proteins,\nthere are, of course, amino\nacids and nonproteins.\nAnd theanine is one such\nnonprotein amino acid.\nTheanine tends to stimulate\nthe so-called glutamate and\nglutamine pathway.\nIt's actually very similar\nto glutamate and glutamine,\nand it has a lot of effects\non a lot of different aspects\nof the nervous system.\nBut the general\neffect of theanine\nis to compete for the receptors\nfor certain neurotransmitters.\nAnd the neurotransmitters\nI'm referring to\nare all excitatory\nneurotransmitters,\nthings like glutamate.\nAnd they govern a tremendous\namount of our daily thinking\nand action and\nfeeling, et cetera,\nbecause they're present\nat so many connections\nbetween neurons in the brain.\nTheanine competes for the\nreceptors for glutamate\nand tends to reduce our\noverall levels of alertness.\nSo really, when people\ntake theanine along\nwith caffeine,\nwhat they're doing\nis they're really\ntaking a slight--\nI don't want to call it\ndepressant to the point\nwhere it misleads people and\nmakes people think that it\nwill make you depressed.\nThe word is a little\nbit misleading.\nBut it tends to\nreduce or blunt some\nof the more excitatory\npro-alertness actions\nof neurons in the brain.\nSo when you take it\nalongside caffeine,\ntends to, quote unquote,\n\"even things out a bit.\"\nI should mention that\nthe dosages of theanine\nthat are effective\nfor offsetting\nthe jitteriness of caffeine\nis 200 to 400 milligrams,\nand the studies that\nI was able to find\nshowed that essentially up\nto 900 milligrams per day\ncan be safe.\nBut that's a very high\ndosage of theanine.\nIn fact, so much so\nthat it might increase\nsleepiness to the point\nwhere it wouldn't feel good.\nThere are also some\npositive effects\nof daytime consumption\nof theanine\nthat are independent of reducing\nthe jitteriness of caffeine.\nFor instance, there's\na study demonstrating\nthat 17 days of ingesting\ntheanine at these 200 to 400\nmilligram dosage at one\nto three times per day\ncan reduce depression\nand anxiety.\nThere are also some good\ndata out there showing\nthat theanine can have positive\neffects on endothelial cells--\nso blood vessels,\ncapillaries, and so on--\nand increase some of the\nfunction of blood vessels,\nallowing them to pass\nmore blood through them\nand give them a little bit\nmore elasticity, if you will.\nSo theanine has certain\npro-sleep effects\nif it's taken prior to sleep.\nIt can enhance the quality,\ndepth, and duration of sleep.\nAgain, if you're a\nsleepwalker or somebody who\nhas extremely vivid dreams\nfrom which you wake up\nin the middle of the\nnight, probably best\nto leave out theanine or\nmaybe reduce the dosage down\nto 100 milligrams.\nAnd if that's still too much,\nthen eliminate it completely.\nBut theanine can be terrific\nfor enhancing quality, depth,\nand duration of sleep.\nIt can also reduce\nthe jitteriness\nassociated with\ncaffeine-containing beverages\nand foods.\nAnd it has certain\nantidepressant\nand pro-endothelial effects.\nThat is, it can\noffset depression.\nIt can offset anxiety, although\nthose are minor effects,\nsubtle effects.\nAnd it has been shown to\nimprove endothelial cell.\nThat is, vessel and capillary\nfunction and structure\nin ways that can be beneficial\nfor both brain and body.\nNow one final point\nabout theanine\nthat's worth paying\nattention to is\nthat the kinetics\nof theanine are\nsuch that you don't need to take\ntheanine every time you ingest\na caffeinated beverage.\nWhen we ingest caffeine,\nthe peak effects of caffeine\noccur about 30 minutes\nafter we drink it.\nAnd there, I'm assuming\none takes it all at once.\nAnd this is a key point that\nwe'll come back to later rather\nthan sipping your coffee\nslowly over a couple of hours\nor an hour.\nIf you drink all 200 or\n300 milligrams of caffeine\nin your coffee or 600\nmilligrams of your coffee\nif you're getting one of\nthose commercial coffees\nand you take theanine\nalong with it,\ntheanine will block\nsome of the jitteriness\nand anxiety-inducing\neffects of caffeine\nthat can occur for much\nlonger than the effects that\ncaffeine lasts.\nSo the peak in theanine occurs\nabout an hour after ingestion.\nI suppose if you want\nto get really fancy\nand really dial in\nthe kinetics, you\ncould ingest theanine\nabout half hour\nbefore you ingest your caffeine.\nBut I think that's getting a\nlittle bit excessive in terms\nof controlling your\nmicroenvironment, if you will.\nI think it would be perfectly\nfine to take a 100 to 200\nmilligram capsule of theanine\nalong with your coffee or tea\nor so forth and just realize\nthat if you drink more caffeine\nor you extend your caffeine\nintake over several hours\nthat you don't necessarily\nhave to take theanine repeated\ntimes throughout the day.\nI'd like to take a\nbrief break and thank\nour sponsor, InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a\nlot of blood and DNA\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get data\nback about metabolic factors,\nlipids, and hormones,\nand so forth, but you don't\nknow what to do with those data.\nInsideTracker\nsolves that problem\nand makes it very easy\nfor you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation-based\ninterventions\nyou might want to\ntake on in order\nto adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors, hormones,\nlipids, and other\nthings that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health to bring\nthose numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate\nand indeed optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nand get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nLet's talk for a moment\nabout when to avoid caffeine.\nAnd in the same stroke,\nlet's also talk about some\nof the myths around caffeine.\nFor instance, one of the\nmajor myths around caffeine\nis that it can\nincrease osteoporosis.\nIt turns out that, while there\nis a relationship, of course,\nbetween calcium\nand osteoporosis--\nthat is reductions\nin bone density.\nAnd it is the case that\ncaffeine can extract calcium\nfrom certain tissues.\nThe large scale studies that\nare out there essentially\nprove that, if people are\ningesting enough calcium\nthrough their diet, which\nmost everybody is-- although\ncertainly, there\nare some people that\nneed to supplement calcium\nor make it a point to consume\nmore calcium-containing foods.\nBut assuming that\nyou are getting\nadequate levels\nof calcium, there\nis no direct relationship\nbetween caffeine intake\nand osteoporosis, at least\nnot that I'm aware of.\nI know this was debated\nfor a number of years\nin the literature,\nbut the literature\nseems to have arrived\nat a general consensus\nnow that caffeine itself is not\ngoing to create or exacerbate\nosteoporosis, provided people\nare getting enough calcium\nthrough their diet.\nThat is, through foods, through\nsupplementation, or both.\nSome of the other\nmyths around caffeine\nare that, for instance, caffeine\nwill reduce testosterone levels\nor will reduce estrogen levels.\nOther myths out there\nare in exact opposite\nto that, that caffeine will\nincrease testosterone levels,\nin particular, free\ntestosterone levels.\nThere have been some large scale\nstudies addressing the hormone\neffects of caffeine.\nThey are a little\nbit difficult to do.\nI should just\nmention that caveat.\nAnd the reason they\nare difficult to do\nis because 90% of adults\nare consuming caffeine.\nAnd therefore, you\ncan imagine it's\nvery hard to find a control\ngroup to compare the caffeine\nconsumers to.\nIn particular, a\ncontrol group that's\nwell controlled for other things\nlike lifestyle, diet, exercise,\net cetera.\nHowever, when one controls\nas well as one can\nfor all the various factors that\ncould impact hormones, what one\ndiscovers is that caffeine\nintake, at least at the dosages\nwe talked about earlier, 1\ntwo 3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight or even\nup to double that,\nthat there are no consistent\nincreases or reductions\nin testosterone or\nestrogen in men or women\nthat can be directly attributed\nto the caffeine intake.\nAnd I say directly attributed\nbecause in these association\nstudies, one always\nhas to wonder,\nfor instance, if because people\nare ingesting more caffeine,\nthey have more energy and\ntherefore exercising more.\nAnd exercise is\nknown to have effects\non testosterone, estrogen,\nand other hormones,\nwhether or not the effects\nof caffeine on those hormones\nis indirect and so\non and so forth.\nAnd this all just\nunderscores the challenges\nof doing studies on\nhumans in the wild\nin their natural habitat\nof living as opposed\nto an acute study as it's\ncalled to bring someone\ninto the laboratory\nand studying them just\nfor those hours or moments.\nWith all that said, there does\nappear to be a relationship\nbetween caffeine intake and\nso-called sex hormone binding\nglobulin, which is a protein\npresent in the body of both men\nand women that binds to\nthe sex steroid hormones--\ntestosterone and estrogen--\nand prevents them\nfrom being in their\nfree or active form.\nIt has been shown that\ningestion of caffeine--\neven in the sorts of dosage\nranges that are considered safe\nand that we've been discussing--\ncan increase sex hormone\nbinding globulin such\nthat it can slightly\nreduce overall levels\nof free testosterone\nand free estradiol in women.\nNow those effects are relatively\nminor, but they do exist.\nIf any of you are interested\nin reading further\ninto the effects of\ncaffeine on hormones,\nI'll just refer you to\na couple of studies.\nWe will link to this in\nthe show note caption.\nThe title of the\nstudy is \"Consumption\nof caffeinated beverages and\nserum concentrations of sex\nsteroid hormones in US men.\"\nAnd within this study,\nthere is a reference\nto a equally sized\nempowered study done\non women, both of\nwhich converged\non the same conclusion, by\nexamining more than a thousand.\nSo in this case, 1,410 men or\nmore than a thousand women,\nthat there are increases in\nsex hormone binding globulin\nassociated with increased\nintake of coffee, in particular.\nBut they were able to narrow\nthat down specifically\nto ingestion of caffeine.\nSo it's not coffee per se that's\ncausing the increase in sex\nhormone binding globulin.\nIt's actually caffeine itself.\nSo again, the increases in\nsex hormone binding globulin\nwere not so significant\nthat, at least to my mind,\nthey seem like a\nconcern, although I\nthink that it is worth noting\nthat if you're going to consume\ncaffeine that you probably\nwant to consume caffeine\nin a way that is in dosages and\nwith the sort of timing that\nwill allow you to get away\nwith ingesting caffeine\nbut not to excess, so to\nderive the benefits of caffeine\nwithout for instance driving\nup sex hormone binding globulin\ntoo far.\nNow why would that\nbe a good idea?\nWhy would you want to make\nsure that you have enough free\ntestosterone and free estrogen?\nWell, some of that is\nrelated to the acute effects\nof those hormones in terms\nof well-being and libido\nand strength and mood, et\ncetera, but some of those\nalso relates to the longer\nterm effects of sex steroid\nhormones.\nMany people don't\nrealize this, but the sex\nsteroid hormones\noperate on the receptors\nat the surface of cells\nto have immediate effects.\nBut they also can enter\ncells and actually\ngo into the nucleus of cells\nwhere the DNA of those cells\nare contained and control gene\nexpression in those cells.\nSo the sex steroid hormones,\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nare controlling a lot of\ndifferent cellular functions\nover long periods of time.\nSo blunting their action\nover long periods of time\nis probably not a great idea.\nBut again, at the\ndosages of caffeine\nthat we're talking about\ntoday, 1 to 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of body\nweight, unlikely\nthat the increases in sex\nhormone binding globulin\nthat one experiences from that\nare going to be detrimental.\nAnd certainly, the\npositive effects\nof caffeine that one experiences\nin terms of mental performance\nand physical\nperformance and the fact\nthat it increases energy\nto do the sorts of things\nlike exercise that we\nknow can profoundly\nimprove hormone\nprofiles, twofold\nor threefold improvement\nin hormone profiles.\nIn that case, it seems that\ningesting caffeine is overall\na good thing, provided\nit's not in excess.\nThat also makes this\nthe appropriate time\nto mention one of the more\nimpressive effects of caffeine,\nwhich is on overall levels\nof mood and mental health.\nThere are several\nstudies on this,\nbut the one that I'm\nparticularly fond of\nwas published in 2019\nin Psychiatry Research.\nAnd the title of the paper\nis \"Inverse association\nbetween caffeine intake\nand depressive symptoms\nin US adults.\"\nAnd these are data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey.\nAnd the basic takeaway is\nthat, while, of course,\nthere are a ton of\ndifferent factors\nthat are going to\nrelate to whether or not\npeople are depressed or\nnot, life circumstances,\ngenetics, and so on, that--\nand here I'm quoting\nfrom the study.\n\"Caffeine's psychostimulant\nproperties--\nthat just means\nthe ability to make\nus feel more alert\nand positive--\nappeared to protect against\ndepressive symptoms.\"\nAnd, of course, they acknowledge\nthat additional studies are\nneeded, but this is just one\nof several studies pointing\nto the fact that people who\nregularly ingest caffeine\nin the appropriate\ndosages do seem\nto enjoy an antidepressive\neffect overall.\nI wouldn't want anyone\nto consider caffeine\na treatment for\nsevere depression\nor at least not\nalone a treatment\nfor severe depression.\nBut provided the\nanxiety-inducing effects\nof caffeine can be kept in\ncheck through use of theanine\nor making sure that the dosage\nand the timing of caffeine\ningestion is correct,\nthen caffeine overall\nseems to be good for our\nmood and prevent depression\nor at least keep\ndepression at bay\nwhen depression might otherwise\nsurface or be more severe.\nAnd, of course, there are the\ndon'ts surrounding caffeine\nintake as it relates to sleep.\nAnd to put it very\nsimply, sleep--\nthat is getting\nenough quality sleep\neach night-- is the foundation.\nIt is the bedrock of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nSleep and the power of sleep\nfar exceeds any nootropic\nyou could ever take,\nany prescription drug\nyou could ever take, any\nhealth-promoting tool\nfor your immune system,\nyour metabolism,\nyour mental function,\nyour physical function you\ncould ever take.\nSleep is the bedrock.\nI know a lot of people\nexperience challenge\nwith sleep.\nNobody is perfect about sleep.\nThat's important\nto keep in mind.\nI think a good goal is\nto get enough quality\nsleep of sufficient duration\n80% of the nights of your life\nand then as much as possible\nto make sure that the remaining\n20% of nights you are\nnot getting enough\nsleep for good reasons as\nopposed to hard reasons.\nGood reasons would\ninclude raising children.\nThat's important.\nAfter all, every species\ndesires to make more of itself\nand to preserve and extend\nthe well-being of its young,\nso child-rearing is a\nperfectly legitimate reason\nto get a lack of sleep.\nBut you really want to strive\nto get quality sleep most nights\nof your life, which means that,\neven if you're somebody who\ncan, quote unquote,\n\"drink an espresso\"\nand then fall right asleep,\nthat you avoid caffeine intake\nin the 12 hours prior to sleep.\nI realize not everyone\nwill be able to do that.\nAnd in fact, I\nsometimes violate that,\nso I tend to go to sleep\naround 10:00 PM every night,\nsometimes 11:00,\noccasionally 12:00 midnight,\nbut usually around\n10:00 PM every night.\nI confess that my last\ningestion of caffeine\nis not always 10:00\nAM or prior to that,\nso sometimes I will\nhave caffeine up\nuntil 11:00 AM or maybe noon.\nAnd very, very rarely, I'll have\nan afternoon coffee or espresso\nor noncalorie-containing\nsoda or tea or something\nthat's of that sort.\nBut I really tried to\nrestrict my caffeine intake\nto the early part of my day\nthat is before noon, given\nthat I go to sleep around\n10:00 PM each night.\nAnd I strongly encourage\neveryone out there\nto try and limit their\nafternoon caffeine intake.\nThis is something that Dr.\nMatt Walker, who's an expert\nsleep researcher out of\nUniversity of California\nBerkeley Psychology and\nneuroscience department there,\nauthor of the incredible\nbook Why We sleep.\nHe's been on this podcast,\nmany other podcasts,\ntalking about the\nimportance of sleep.\nHe will remind us, and\nI'll remind you now\nthat the quarter life\nof caffeine is 12 hours.\nI mentioned this earlier, but\nI'm going to repeat it again.\nAnd that means that, if you\ningest caffeine at noon,\n25% of its effects\nmore or less, OK?\nI'm using a broad stroke here\nto talk about quarter life.\n25% of that is still going\nto be bioactive at midnight\nthat night, which will disrupt\nthe early phase of your night,\nthe amount of slow-wave\nsleep, which then in turn\nwill disrupt the amount of rapid\neye movement sleep, which will\ndisrupt your\nemotional processing\nduring the following day\nand so on and so forth.\nNone of this is\nto say that if you\nhave the occasional cup of\ncoffee in the afternoon,\nthat it's going to\ncompletely demolish\nyour sleep/wake cycle forever.\nBut I really encourage people\nto avoid drinking caffeine\nin the 12 hours prior to sleep.\nAnd if you can't do that, within\nthe 10 hours prior to sleep.\nAnd if you can't do that, within\nthe 8 hours prior to sleep.\nSo really try and\nlimit your caffeine\nintake in the 8\nto 12 hours prior\nto going to sleep at night.\nAnd, of course, slow-wave\nsleep, aka deep sleep,\nis the sleep that's associated\nwith somewhat mundane dreams,\nwhich makes it sound like it\nmight not be that important.\nBut it's also the sleep that's\nassociated with growth hormone\nrelease, which is important\nfor protein synthesis,\nrepair of all bodily\ntissues and metabolism.\nAnd slow-wave sleep\nis also critically\nattached to your\nimmune system's ability\nto clear out bacteria and\nviruses that might otherwise\ninfect your tissues.\nNow I'd like to talk about\ncaffeine and performance.\nAnd that includes both\nmental performance\nand physical performance.\nNow I'd like to\ntalk about caffeine\nand its positive\neffects on performance\nwhen used correctly.\nAnd here we are referring\nto both mental performance\nand physical performance.\nThe exploration of caffeine\nas a pro-performance tool\nhas been explored since\nthe 1930s, at least\nthat's some of the earliest\ndocumented literature on this.\nAlthough I have\nto imagine, given\nthat people have been\nusing caffeine for much\nlonger than that, that long\nago somebody realized that,\nby ingesting a certain\nplant, that they\nfelt much more\nalertness and were\nable to hunt and gather or do\nany number of different things\nbetter and, as a\nconsequence, decide\nto consume more of that plant.\nNow these days, we\nconsume a lot of caffeine\nin the form of coffee\nand tea mainly,\nand some people consume it in\nthe form of caffeine tablets\nor energy drinks, et cetera.\nAcross the board, one\nfinds that caffeine intake\nat a level of 1 to 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of body weight\nimproves reaction time.\nThat is, it reduces\nthe amount of time\nto take a physical action or\nto answer a question correctly\nwith a verbal response.\nIt can also improve\ncoordination.\nIt can also improve\nmemory, although I\ndo want to mention that, whereas\nmost studies of the effects\nof caffeine on improving\nmental and physical performance\ninvolve taking caffeine at 1\nto 3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight before the\nmental task or physical task,\nthere is also a pro-performance\neffect of caffeine on memory\nif one takes caffeine after\nlearning certain material\nor I should say being\nexposed to certain material.\nWe'll come back to\nthat in a few minutes.\nIf one examines reaction\ntime, mood, alertness, focus,\nand memory or the\nability to call up\ninformation from memory, or\nphysical dexterity, power\noutput, endurance, and\noverall feelings of well-being\nduring exercise and\nexertion, caffeine\nhas been shown in numerous\nstudies in both men and women\nto improve all of those\nmetrics significantly.\nSo this is all just\nto say that caffeine\nis an incredible\nperformance-enhancing tool.\nNow, what's not obvious from\nthe statement that caffeine is\na performance-enhancing\ntool across the board\nand in men and women and\nin different contexts\nis that the way in\nwhich caffeine is taken\nis very important.\nBecause 90% or more of\nadults consume caffeine,\nfinding controls for studies of\ncaffeine is really challenging.\nThat is, finding people\nwho don't ingest caffeine\nregularly is a very challenging\ntask for the researcher.\nAnd as a consequence,\nmany of the studies\nof caffeine on\nhuman beings involve\ndepriving regular\ncaffeine users of caffeine\nand then examining the\neffects of caffeine\ngiven after a period of, say,\n5 to 15 days of abstinence\nin a person that is essentially\nexperiencing mild withdrawal\nsymptoms because they haven't\nhad the caffeine that they were\nused to getting.\nSo this is an important point.\nAnd it's a point that\nlikely exacerbates\nthe observed pro-performance\neffects of caffeine.\nNow all of that isn't\nnecessarily a problem,\nprovided you keep it in mind.\nAnd it actually points\nto a way in which\neven if you're a\nregular caffeine user,\nyou can extract more of\nthe benefits of caffeine.\nThe simplest way to\ndo this, for instance,\nis to look back to what we\ntalked about earlier in terms\nof the need to have most of your\ncortisol increase restricted\nto the hour or hours just\nafter waking in terms of mood\nand alertness and performance.\nOne of the ways to increase\nthe peak of that cortisol\nearly in the day is to\nconsume caffeine shortly\nafter that peak occurs.\nAnd this was really\nnicely demonstrated\nin a study entitled\ncaffeine stimulation\nof cortisol secretion across\nthe waking hours in relation\nto caffeine intake levels.\nWe will provide a\nlink to this study.\nIt's a somewhat\ncomplicated study\nbecause they looked at a bunch\nof different times of day\nfor caffeine intake.\nAnd I should mention,\nin this study,\nthey use this 300 milligrams per\nday or 600 milligrams per day.\nSo that's quite high, although\nfor people of sufficient body\nweight and who are accustomed\nto taking caffeine,\nit's certainly not\ngoing to be in excess\nof what a lot of people\nout there are taking.\nBut basically, what they\nobserved was the following.\nCortisol responses to\ncaffeine are reduced but not\neliminated in people who consume\ncaffeine on a daily basis.\nWhat this means is\nthat, if you wake up--\nas I recommended\nearlier, you avoid\ndrinking caffeine for the first\n90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nbut you do get some sunlight or\nother bright light in your eyes\nin that time, maybe\neven get some exercise\nin that time, which\nwould be even better--\nand then you ingest caffeine,\nyou will get a further increase\nin cortisol, which,\nprovided it's restricted\nto the early part of the day,\nis a good thing overall for mood\nand alertness.\nSo this is a simple\nperformance-enhancing tool,\nwhich is to stack\ncaffeine on the tail\nof that early cortisol peak.\nI should also mention,\nhowever, that, in this study,\nthey had people do a five-day\ncaffeine abstinence prior\nto being tested with 300\nmilligrams or 600 milligrams\nof caffeine.\nSo the simple tool to extract\nfrom this and other studies\nlike it is that, if\nyou want to experience\nthe maximum alertness-promoting\neffects of caffeine\nwhen you ingest it\nearly in the day,\nyou would abstain from\ncaffeine for five days\nand then ingest caffeine 90\nto 120 minutes after waking.\nI would still hope that you\nwere doing all the other things\nthat I described-- morning\nsunlight, exercise, et cetera--\ncorrectly.\nBut regardless, it's very clear\nthat a five-day abstinence\nfrom caffeine however\npainful that might be\nwill increase the\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine when you take\ncaffeine on that sixth day.\nNow, I'm sure many of you out\nthere are saying, why would\nI ever want to abstain\nfrom caffeine for five days\nin order to just get this\nsix-day performance-enhancing\neffect?\nWell, there are a couple\nof reasons for doing that.\nPerhaps you're planning to\ntravel to a new time zone,\nand you want to use\ncaffeine as a stimulant\nto stay up during the\nday in the new time zone.\nThat's a somewhat unusual case.\nOthers of you\nmight be interested\nin the pro-physical performance\neffects of caffeine.\nWe'll talk more about\nthese in a little bit.\nBut you want to get\nthe maximum strength\nincrease or the maximum\nendurance increase\nfrom ingesting, in this\ncase, 300 to 600 milligrams\nof caffeine.\nWell, in that case, abstaining\nfrom caffeine for five days\nwill greatly exacerbate\nthe pro-performance effects\nof caffeine when you take\nit on that sixth day,\nalthough admittedly,\nthose five days are\nlikely to be pretty painful if\nyou're a regular caffeine user.\nAnother variation\non this, however,\nmight be to have the\namount of caffeine\nthat you ingest on a daily\nbasis and then go back\nto your regular level of\ncaffeine intake on that\nday in which you need the\ncaffeine to really boost\nyour mood, energy,\nand performance.\nAnother reason why you might\nwant to abstain from caffeine\nor reduce your caffeine\nintake for a period of time\nand then go back to your\nregular caffeine intake\nis simply to identify how\nmuch of an effect caffeine\nis really having on your overall\nlevel of daily functioning\nand mood.\nThis was something\nthat was actually\ncovered in beautiful detail\nin a book by Michael Pollan\nall about caffeine.\nIt's available on Audible.\nI really enjoyed that book.\nIt describes his experience\nwith the decision\nto completely\nabstain from caffeine\nfor a period of months, although\nI confess that after hearing\nthat book, what it\nbasically made me want to do\nis never quit drinking\ncaffeine because it sounded\nas if, at least my\ninterpretation was, that\neven after several weeks\nor months of abstaining\nfrom caffeine, that\nhe still fantasized\nabout the effects of caffeine.\nBut he did mention that, when\nreturning to ingesting caffeine\nafter a period of\nlong abstinence,\nthat it had almost a--\nlet's not call it a\npsychedelic property,\nbut it had such\nobvious effects on mood\nand alertness and\nfeelings of well-being\nthat it really highlighted\nfor him the extent\nto which caffeine normally was\nallowing him to just function\nwhat he thought was normally.\nSo in other words,\nmany of us don't even\nreally know what our\nnormal basal level\nof cognitive and\nphysical functioning\nis because we're\ningesting caffeine\non such a regular basis.\nI confess that, as much\nas I enjoyed that book\nand as intriguing as his\ndescription of caffeine\nabstinence and then the\nreturn to caffeine was,\nI don't intend to ever\nfind out personally.\nNow a very good\nreason why you might\nwant to abstain from caffeine\nfor a deliberate period of time\nand then return\nto caffeine intake\nis for its physical\nperformance-enhancing effects.\nAnd here we can look to a\nreally interesting study.\nThe title of which\nis \"Time course\nof tolerance to the performance\neffects of caffeine.\"\nAnd what I like about this\nstudy is that, while yes,\nit does say that\nabstaining from caffeine\nand then returning\nto caffeine intake\ncan enhance physical performance\nin a very specific way,\nit also says that, if you\ntake caffeine regularly,\nyou can still see the physical\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine.\nAlthough they are not quite\nas robust as they would be had\nyou abstained from caffeine.\nThe design of the study\nis pretty straightforward.\nThey had people either\ningest 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of caffeine\nfor 20 consecutive days.\nMany people are already\ndoing that, I realize,\nbut they had people\ndo that or ensure\nthat they were doing that.\nOr others ingested a\nplacebo for 20 days,\nso they abstained from\ncaffeine without realizing it.\nThen after that 20 days of\neither ingesting caffeine\nor a placebo, their\npeak performance\nwas measured in terms\nof aerobic output.\nBut prior to that measurement,\nthey had caffeine, OK?\nSo it's 20 days of caffeine\nand then a 21st day of caffeine\nand then the physical\ntask on that 21st day.\nOr it's 20 days of\nabstinence from caffeine.\nAnd then on day 21,\nyou get caffeine,\nand you get the\nsame physical test.\nAnd what they discovered was\nthat the ingestion of caffeine\nincreased peak performance\nin this aerobic output\ndramatically if people had\nabstained from caffeine.\nBut for people that had consumed\ncaffeine all the way through up\nuntil that day, it still was\neffective to ingest caffeine\non day 21 but not as effective\nas it would have been had\nthey abstained.\nAnd in fact, the\nmagnitude of what\nthey call ergogenic\neffect, which\nis the pro-performance-enhancing\neffect of caffeine,\nwas higher on the first\nday than in subsequent days\nwhen they allowed people to\ncontinue caffeine intake.\nSo the takeaway from this study\nis really straightforward.\nIf you want to get the maximum\nphysical performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine, you abstain\nfrom caffeine for 20 days.\nThen on day 21,\nwhen you're going\nto do the physical\nthing, the task,\nyou ingest caffeine about\n30 minutes to an hour\nbefore you do that\nphysical challenge.\nNow 20 days of\nabstinence is going\nto be rough for a lot of people.\nI certainly don't want to\nsign up for this study.\nIn which case, you might want\nto do five days of abstinence\nas we talked about before.\nAnd then on day six is the day\nthat you ingest caffeine and do\nthe physical task.\nThere are even some\nstudies showing\nthat you can abstain from\ncaffeine for just two days,\nfor just 48 hours.\nAnd, in particular, if you are\na regular user of caffeine,\nthis allows you\nto, on day three,\ningest caffeine at the dose\nthat's appropriate for you\nand do the physical, or I should\nmention mental performance task\nand perform significantly\nbetter than those\nthat have been taking caffeine\nthroughout the entire period\nleading up to the challenge.\nSo you don't necessarily\nneed to abstain for 20 days\nin order to get the\npro-performance effects\nof caffeine on day 21.\nYou could do five days of\nabstinence prior or even\ntwo days of abstinence prior.\nOr if that's intolerable\nto you as it is in my mind,\nto me, to just reduce your\ncaffeine intake slightly\nor even perhaps have it\nif you can tolerate that\nin the week or two weeks\nor maybe even three\nweeks preceding some\nphysical or mental challenge.\nNow again, this sort of\nimplies that you're going up\nagainst a marathon,\nor you're going up\nagainst a series of long\ntests, maybe standardized tests\nin one day.\nThere, I just really\nwant to point out\nthat there is an abundant\nliterature showing that people\nperform best on mental tests\nif they are in the state\nthat they were when they\nstudied for that material.\nNow in college, I knew\na number of people\nwho took this to the extreme,\nthinking that if they were\nto study under the\neffects of alcohol,\nthat they would be best\noff consuming alcohol\nprior to taking exams.\nAnd it turns out\nto not be the case.\nHere we're talking,\nin particular, about\npsychostimulant effects of\ncaffeine and other compounds.\nSo don't think\nthat you can drink\nor be under the influence\nof THC and then take--\nwhen you study and then take an\nexam under the same influence\nand do just as well as you would\nhad you not ingested anything.\nPlease don't let\nthat be the takeaway.\nHowever, do let\nit be the takeaway\nthat caffeine's\neffects are made more\npotent by a brief to not so\nbrief period of abstinence\nprior to taking a\ndosage of caffeine.\nAnd then the final\npoint to make is\nthat, if you are somebody who\nis not accustomed to drinking\ncaffeine, meaning you're\nhypersensitive to caffeine\nor you don't regularly\ningest caffeine, please\ndo not ingest\ncaffeine on the day\nof any important mental\nor physical challenge\nor performance, because\nwhat you will find\nis that because you are\nnot caffeine-adapted,\nyou will experience changes\nin your thermal regulation,\nin your levels of\nanxiety and jitteriness,\nand your levels of\nfocus that could\nbe very detrimental to mental\nor physical performance.\nSo you don't want to throw\nyourself in the deep end\nby ingesting caffeine if\nyou're not used to it.\nAnd I should mention\nthat for people\nthat are not accustomed\nto ingesting caffeine\nor are very sensitive\nto caffeine.\nEven 25 to 50 milligrams\nof caffeine in the amount\nthat's found in, for\ninstance, a piece\nof certain types of chocolate\ncan actually cause anxiety.\nSo be careful there.\nHere, I'm referring only to\npeople that are accustomed\nwith caffeine intake.\nSo what I recommend is to\nexplore the ergogenic effects\nof caffeine during your training\nand then to make a decision\nabout what you can\nreasonably and reliably do\nin terms of abstinence and\nthen pulse with caffeine\non the day of the challenge.\nI get a lot of questions\nas to whether or not\ncaffeine has different\neffects on the nervous system\nand on performance in\nparticular, depending on phases\nof the menstrual cycle.\nSo I explored that in my\nresearch for this episode,\nand I found two\nstudies both of which\nwe will reference in\nthe show note captions.\nThe first one is entitled\n\"Caffeine consumption\nand menstrual function.\"\nSo it's actually the\nrelationship between caffeine\nand menstrual function.\nWe will do an entire episode\nabout the menstrual cycle\nand menstrual function.\nBut the other one as it\nrelates to performance\nwas published in 2020 in the\nEuropean Journal of Nutrition,\nwhich is \"Ergogenic\neffects of caffeine\non peak aerobic cycling power\nduring the menstrual cycle.\"\nAnd the basic takeaway\nof this study is--\nfrankly, a very nice study,\nshowed that quote, \"Caffeine\nincreased peak aerobic cycling\npower in the early follicular,\npreovulatory, and midluteal\nphases of the menstrual cycle.\"\nThus, the ingestion--\nand again, here they\nuse 3 milligrams of caffeine\nper kilogram of body mass\nmight be considered an\nergogenic aid for women\nwho are in the menstrual\ncycle during all three\nphases of their cycle.\nSo keep that in mind, women--\nfor those of you that are\nregular users of caffeine\nor you're using caffeine to\nenhance physical performance,\nthere does not seem to be any\nmenstrual cycle phase-dependent\neffects of caffeine\non performance.\nThat is, caffeine seems\nto always increase\nphysical performance\nregardless of the phase\nof the menstrual cycle\nyou might happen to be in.\nI'd like to touch on a little\nbit more of the use of caffeine\nfor enhancing\nmental performance.\nYes, it is the case that\ningesting 1 to 3 milligrams\nof caffeine per kilogram of\nbody weight in the 30 minutes\nor so prior to\ndoing a memory task\nor sitting down to\ndoing some studying\nor learning of any kind,\nphysical or mental performance,\nof any kind is beneficial\nfor all the reasons we talked\nabout before, relate to dopamine\nand acetylcholine, et cetera.\nBut it turns out that\nit is also the case that\nspiking one's adrenaline\nand other so-called\ncatecholamines-- so this would\nbe dopamine, norepinephrine,\nand epinephrine-- after\na bout of learning\ncan greatly enhance\nmemory for the information\nthat one was trying to learn.\nThat's right.\nSpiking your adrenaline\nafter learning\ncan greatly increase\nmemory for the material\nyou're trying to learn.\nIn fact, this is a practice that\ndates back centuries and was\nwritten about in a beautiful\nAnnual Review of Neuroscience\non the biology of memory by\nJames McGaugh, where he talks\nabout medieval\npractices of children\nbeing taught information and\nthen being thrown literally\ninto cold water to stimulate\nthe release of adrenaline\nand that increase in adrenaline.\nWhile the mechanism wasn't\ncompletely understood,\nit was understood that\nthat sort of shock\nto the system from\nthe cold water\nled to better memory and\nretention of the information\nthat these children\nhad been exposed to.\nAnd it turns out\nthe exact same thing\nis true for adults\nin the laboratory\nor kids in the laboratory.\nAnd here I'm not\nsuggesting throwing anyone\ninto cold water.\nIf you want to get\ninto cold water,\nthere's a reason we\ncall it deliberate\ncold exposure on the\npodcast is that it\nshould be deliberate and\ncontrolled by you, not\nby somebody else.\nAnd if it's controlled\nby somebody else,\nthat might be military\nscreening or something.\nBut here we're talking about\ndeliberately increasing\nyour levels of adrenaline and\nother catecholamines, dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, et cetera.\nYou can do that certainly\nby deliberate cold exposure\nwith a cold shower or\ngetting in up to your neck\nin cold water of any kind.\nBut the other way to do that\nis to spike your adrenaline\nby ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of caffeine\nafter sitting down to try and\nlearn some material I confess\nthat, more often than not, I\nuse caffeine in the same way\nthat most people\nuse it, which is OK.\nI'm going to sit down.\nI'm going to research\ninformation for a podcast\nor assemble some information\nfor a paper or grant,\nand I want to focus.\nSo I will drink a cup of\ncoffee at the beginning of that\nand maybe even throughout\nthat or a couple of yerba maté\nat the beginning\nor throughout that.\nOr I'll sip on one or both\nthroughout trying to learn.\nAnd that works\nquite well in terms\nof maintaining focus and\nalertness and retention\nof information, but\nit is indeed the case.\nThat is, the research\nsupports the fact.\nAnd I've experienced\nthe fact that,\nif I abstain from caffeine while\nI'm trying to learn something--\nbut then I drink caffeine\nimmediately after.\nSomewhat surprisingly to me\nbut certainly in a way that's\nconsistent with the\nresearch literature, memory\nfor the information that I was\nfocused on prior to ingesting\nthat caffeine is much greater.\nAnd here I'm talking about\nas a personal anecdote,\nbut this is actually what the\ndata point to both in animals\nand in humans.\nAnd if you think about\nit, it makes perfect sense\nbecause the way that the\nmemory systems of the brain\nare organized is that we go\nthrough life experiencing\nthings.\nWe encounter surprises\nboth good and bad.\nWe go through the motions of\nthings both typical, mundane,\nexciting, and novel,\nand not novel.\nAnd then every once\nin a while, something\nwill happen that will\nspike our catecholamines.\nDopamine, typically if\nit's a positive surprise.\nAdrenaline, which\ncan be associated\nwith both positive\nsurprise or positive events\nand negative events\nor surprises.\nAnd without fail, increases\nin the catecholamines\ntend to lock in\nmemories for things\nthat preceded the increase\nin those catecholamines.\nAgain, the catecholamines\nbeing dopamine, epinephrine,\nand norepinephrine, sometimes\nall three in combination,\nsometimes just two of those,\nsometimes just one of those,\ndepending on the experience.\nSo it makes perfect\nsense that using caffeine\nat the end of a\nlearning bout would\nenhance our memory\nfor the information\nthat we are trying to learn.\nSo if you decide that you\nwant to try and extract\nthis performance-enhancing\neffect of caffeine, what\nI recommend would be to try and\nabstain from caffeine for a day\nor two prior.\nBut if you can't,\nyou just continue\nwith your normal\ncaffeine intake.\nBut then when you sit down\nto study or learn something\nto not ingest any caffeine as\nyou do that but then afterward\nto ingest caffeine.\nNow in theory, you could\nprobably further enhance\nthe memory encoding\neffects of adrenaline\nand the other catecholamines\nby drinking caffeine\nand then taking a cold shower or\ndoing deliberate cold exposure\nif you really wanted to\nor had the ability to\nor doing some sort of\nintense form of exercise.\nAnd we'll talk in\na moment about how\ncaffeine, exercise, and the\nadrenaline system interact.\nBut as a brief but\nrelevant to side,\nbrief bouts of intense exercise\nranging from 10 to 50 minutes\nor so have been shown to\nimprove memory for information\nthat one was trying to learn\nprior to the intense exercise.\nThis is work from Dr.\nWendy Suzuki's lab at NYU\nas well as other\nlaboratories, some of the work\nthat's being done at Stanford\nin the Mind, Body Laboratories.\nAnd our laboratory points in\nthe direction of these kinds\nof effects as well.\nThey all come back to the\nsame general neurochemical\ntheme, which is that,\nwhen we experience\nan increase in these\ncatecholamines that include\nadrenaline, dopamine,\nand norepinephrine,\nthe memory systems of the\nbrain flip on in a way that\ntry to capture the information\nand the perceptions\nand the experiences that we\nwere exposed to just prior\nto the increase in\ncatecholamines and caffeine\nbut also exercise\nand also cold water.\nAnd, of course, any of those\nalone or in combination\nall increase the levels\nof catecholamines,\nso it makes perfect\nlogical mechanistic sense\nas to why this would work.\nAnd in fact, it does work.\nIf you want to remember\nspecific information,\nyou might consider using\ncaffeine as you move through\nand absorb and are exposed\nto that information.\nBut you might also\nconsider using caffeine\nafter being exposed\nto that information\nbecause studies in\nanimals and humans\nshow that that is a potent way\nto increase memory for what\nyou are just exposed to.\nI should mention that\nwhat I just described also\npushes back on something that\nI know a number of people\nperhaps have heard about\nand maybe even use, which is\nthis notion of the nappuccino.\nI remember hearing about\nthis a few years back.\nIt was sort of\ntrend, if you will.\nThe trend involved\ndrinking a cup of coffee\nor a double espresso and then\ngoing down for a nap typically\nin the afternoon\nand then waking up.\nAnd the idea was that the\ncaffeine would hit your system\nright at the time that\nyou awake from the nap\nand that you would be better\nable to focus and exercise.\nThere are a couple of things\nabout that practice that I\ndon't like.\nFirst of all, it\nimplies, in most cases,\nthat you're napping\nand ingesting\ncaffeine in the afternoon, which\nI realize for many students\nand for people that are\ncomfortable staying up\nuntil the wee hours of the\nnight and then waking up\nlate the next day might be\ncompatible with their schedule.\nBut again, because of the\nsleep-diminishing effects\nof caffeine--\nand we talked about earlier.\nI'm not crazy about\nthe idea of people\ningesting caffeine\nin the late afternoon\nin order to perform better\nin the late afternoon.\nFar better would be to\nrestrict caffeine intake\nto the early part of the day\nas we talked about earlier.\nThe other reason\nis that the data\non things like\nnon-sleep deep rest\nand naps in the afternoon--\nand again, the rule here\nis that you don't have to nap.\nBut if you want\nto nap, it's been\nshown that naps of\n90 minutes or less\nor non-sleep deep rest\nprotocols-- and you\ncan find those-- for instance,\nthere's one with me speaking.\nYou just put NSDR\nHuberman into YouTube.\nYou can hear that.\nIt's completely zero cost.\nThere are other NSDR\nscripts out there\nnow, of course, if you prefer\nthose, that those can all\nlead to increases in one\nof the catecholamines\nat least, which is dopamine.\nThat's been shown in a really\nnice neurotransmitter labeling\nstudy, not from my laboratory,\nbut from another laboratory,\nbut also can improve mood,\nfocus, and alertness on its own\nwithout the need to\ningest caffeine prior\nto going into those states.\nAnd in fact, ingesting\ncaffeine prior to a nap\nor ingesting caffeine\nprior to NSDR\nis most certainly going to\nreduce the effectiveness\nof that nap and\nNSDR in restoring\nnatural levels of\nalertness and focus\nthat would lead to the\nperformance-enhancing effect.\nSo I'm not such a fan of\nthe so-called nappuccino,\nalthough if any of you\nout there have derived\ngreat benefit from\nit, definitely\nlet me know your protocol\nand what you've experienced.\nPut it in the comment\nsection if you would.\nI'd appreciate that.\nThere's another very important\nand potent use of caffeine\nfor enhancing performance.\nAnd this relates not just to\nthe dopamine and epinephrine\nand the arousal-inducing\neffects of caffeine.\nAnd it doesn't even just relate\nto the effect of caffeine\non enhancing frontal\nlobe function.\nIt does include all\nthat, but it also\nincludes those reinforcing\neffects of caffeine\nthat we talked about at the\nbeginning of the episode.\nAnd the best way to illustrate\nthese performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine\nthat stem directly\nfrom its association\nwith reinforcement\nis to highlight a study.\nAnd the title of the study\nis \"Blood dopamine level\nenhanced by caffeine in men\nafter treadmill running.\"\nAnd as the title suggests,\nthis was carried out in men,\nbut there's no reason to think\nthat the same results wouldn't\nalso be present in women.\nThere are some sex-dependent\neffects of caffeine.\nI'll touch on just\nbriefly at the end.\nBut those are largely\npresent in kids.\nThat is, adolescents and\nteens as opposed to adults.\nSo this study is\nreally interesting.\nWhat they had people do was\nrun on a treadmill and either\ningest caffeine-- again, 3\nmilligrams per kilogram of body\nweight--\nor to not ingest caffeine.\nAnd then they looked\nat levels of dopamine\nand other neurotransmitters\nand hormones,\nsuch as prolactin and cortisol.\nAnd the basic takeaway\nis, as the title suggests,\nthat exercise, while on its\nown, can increase cortisol\nin healthy ways, provided it's\nnot too intense and too long.\nA little note here, if you\nhave trouble recovering\nfrom exercise or\nyou want to continue\nto derive the benefits from\nexercise, in general, best not\nto do high-intensity exercise\nfor longer than 75 minutes.\nOr 90 minutes probably\nbeing the outer threshold.\nI realized that there are\nsome genetic freaks out there\nor people that are\nchemically assisted\nthat can recover from very\nintense long bouts of exercise.\nBut most people don't do\nwell through long bouts\nof intense exercise\non a regular basis.\nAnd limiting their\nintense exercise\nto 60 minutes or less--\nthat doesn't include\nthe warm-up--\nis going to be beneficial.\nSee the episode on\ntool kit for fitness\nif you'd like details on that.\nExercise is known to increase\nlevels of dopamine, cortisol,\nand other catecholamines and\nneurotransmitters very potently\nand things like\ntestosterone and estrogen\nin ways that we know\nare beneficial to us\nand, of course, have all\nthese positive effects\non the musculoskeletal system\nand cardiovascular effects.\nBut unbeknownst to most\npeople, ingesting 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of caffeine\nprior to exercise further\nincreases the dopamine release\nassociated with exercise\nspecifically.\nAnd this has two\nimportant effects.\nFirst of all, that\nincrease in dopamine\nis great because it provides\na long-lasting increase\nin focus alertness\nand motivation,\nnot just during the exercise,\nbut also after the exercise.\nAnd second, it-- that\nis, caffeine and dopamine\nin combination--\nact as a reinforcer\nto make the experience of\nexercise and the period\nimmediate after exercise\nmore pleasant and, in fact,\nreinforcing.\nSo in other words, one\nway to enjoy exercise more\nand to enjoy the activities\nthat follow exercise more\nand to experience a genuine\nincrease in dopamine that's\nbeneficial for\nmood and alertness\nis to ingest caffeine\nprior to exercise.\nNow this is important because\na number of people out there\nare exercising, love\nexercise, love eating great,\nlove doing all the\nthings that are\nbeneficial for their health,\nbut a number of people out there\nreally don't like to exercise.\nAnd that serves as a serious\nblock for their willingness\nand their consistency\nto exercise.\nIngesting caffeine gives\nus energy to exercise.\nIt increases the release of\nneurochemicals and hormones\nthat are good for\nus during exercise.\nBut as I'm highlighting\nhere, it also\nincreases the\nreinforcement pathways\nassociated with exercise.\nThat is, it creates\na positive feeling\nabout the general theme\nof engaging in exercise,\nand it creates a general\npositive experience\nof the things that\nfollow exercise.\nSo I think this, if nothing\nelse is a call for or support\nfor the idea, that\ningesting caffeine\nas a performance-enhancing\ntool makes perfect sense.\nBut for those out there\nthat don't enjoy exercise,\nin particular, certain\nforms of exercise,\ningesting caffeine can\nchange your relationship\nto that exercise.\nIn other words, make it more\npositive, much in the same way\nthat ingesting caffeine\nalongside a certain taste that\nwould otherwise be neutral\nor maybe even negative\ncan actually make the taste of\nthat particular drink or food\npositive.\nSo again, this brings us back\nto the reinforcing properties\nof caffeine that\nare subconscious.\nIt's not just about the\nenhanced performance in the test\nor the enhanced performance\non the treadmill\nor with the weights in the gym.\nIt's enhanced feelings\nof mood and well-being\nthat are genuine because\nof the effect of caffeine\non certain neurotransmitter\nand hormone systems,\nbut it also is creating\nan overall milieu\nof reinforcing all\nof the things that\nled in to occur during\nand occur after exercise.\nI do want to point out something\nthat's very important as it\nrelates to combining\nthings like caffeine\nand exercise in order\nto increase dopamine.\nThis is something that\ncame up in the episode\nthat I did on dopamine,\nmotivation, and drive, which\nturns out to be one of\nour most popular episodes.\nAgain, you can find that at\nhubermanlab.com and links\nto all formats with\ntime stamps, et cetera.\nThis also came up in\nthe episode on ADHD\nbecause of the relationship\nbetween ADHD and dopamine.\nAnd that's this notion\nof dopamine stacking.\nIn the episode on dopamine,\nmotivation, and drive,\nI pointed out that, while there\nare a near-infinite number\nof things that can\nincrease dopamine release,\nmost notably positive surprise\nor positive anticipation\nor experiencing a win.\nCertainly, there are compounds,\nboth drugs of abuse, food, sex,\nand certain supplements\nthat can increase dopamine\nto varying levels and\nto varying degrees,\nboth healthy and unhealthy.\nThat's all contained in\nthat episode on dopamine,\nmotivation, and drive.\nBut what I pointed\nout is that, if you\nare somebody who tends\nto experience difficulty\nwith motivation-- that\nso-called dopamine\nstacking as I called\nit might be something\nthat you want to avoid.\nWhat's dopamine stacking?\nDopamine stacking\nwould be combining\na highly caffeinated energy\ndrink that also includes\nthe amino acid tyrosine, which\nis a precursor to dopamine,\nplus loud music plus getting\nyourself really ramped up\nthen an intense workout.\nAll of that can be great if you\ndo it every once in a while.\nBut what you will quickly find\nis that the extent to which\nyour dopamine\npeaks also dictates\nthe extent to which\nyour dopamine will\ndrop after that peak.\nAnd when I say drop, I\nmean drop below baseline.\nSo a lot of people find that,\nif they stack a lot of things\nto peak their dopamine,\nthen they experience a low,\nand it does take some time for\nthem to return to baseline.\nAnd I highly recommend\nnot engaging in activities\nor consuming compounds that\nare in attempt to accelerate\nthat return to baseline\nbecause all it will do\nis drive that baseline\nlower and lower.\nSo this requires\nbeing able to tolerate\na drop in dopamine baseline for\na period of time, et cetera.\nNow the reason I'm\nbringing this up now\nin the context of\nthis caffeine episode\nis I just described a study\nin which using caffeine\nprior to exercise increases\ndopamine after exercise.\nAnd so you might be\nsaying, especially\nif you heard that earlier\nepisode, wait, isn't\nthat dopamine stacking?\nAren't you encouraging\nme to stack my dopamine?\nWell, in some sense, yes.\nBut keep in mind,\nI'm not suggesting\nthat you do this every\ntime you exercise.\nSo just as in that\nearlier episode,\nI emphasized the fact\nthat, while stacking\nmultiple stimuli--\ncaffeine or energy drinks\nand music and et cetera--\nfor exercise or for mental\nwork or for any experience\nfor that matter is OK to do\nevery once in a while for most\npeople, you don't want to\nget in the habit of doing it\nconsistently every\ntime you exercise\nor every time you go\nout, for instance.\nAnd so you really\nwant to be cautious.\nThat is, you want to\nprotect your both baseline\nlevels of dopamine and your\npeak levels of dopamine.\nThat said, for people\nthat want to experience\nan increase in mood,\nalertness, and performance,\nor who want to\ncondition themselves--\nbecause that's\nreally what it is.\nIt's conditioning yourself\nby the reinforcing effects\nof dopamine to increase\nyour liking or maybe even\nyour loving of exercise.\nOccasionally, using\ncaffeine or frequently\nusing caffeine prior to exercise\nis fine but be very careful.\nAnd by being very\ncareful, what I mean\nis pay attention to how you\nfeel in the hours and days\nafter that dopamine\nincrease wears off.\nSo for instance, if you ingest\ncaffeine and then exercise\nvery intensely and you're\nfeeling great afterwards\nbut then eight hours\nlater or the next day,\nyou're feeling a\nlittle bit low, I\nsuggest you don't go back and\ndo the exact same thing right\naway.\nI would give yourself\na little bit of time\nto let that baseline of\ndopamine return to normal.\nSo again, stacking\ndifferent things,\nchemical and behavioral, in\norder to increase dopamine\ncan be done in a safe way\nthat's beneficial to you,\ndepending on your goals.\nBut be careful about not\nstacking too many stimuli\nfor dopamine too often.\nThat's the key.\nEarly in the\nepisode, I mentioned\none possible\ncaffeine-consuming schedule\nthat works very well that\ndoesn't fortunately subject you\nto long 20-day bouts or 5-day or\neven 2-day bouts of abstinence.\nAnd that's the every other\nday schedule of caffeine.\nIf you look at the\nhalf-life of caffeine\nand you look at its effects\non the dopamine system\nand its\nperformance-enhancing effects\nand how a period of abstinence\ncan, in fact, increase\nthe performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine--\nbut also take into\nconsideration that caffeine\ncan be habit-forming, and we\ncan develop a sort of tolerance\nto caffeine.\nWell then, what emerges\nfrom all of that\nis that being a person\nwho consumes caffeine\nevery other day\ncan actually help\nyou maximize most of the\npositive effects of caffeine\nwithout subjecting you to the\nkind of misery that occurs\nif you're accustomed\nto consuming\ncaffeine every single day and\nthen suddenly go into a 2 or 5\nor 20-day abstinence.\nSo I myself have never tried\nan every other day caffeine\napproach, although\nI'm considering\ndoing it based on the\nliterature that I've read.\nAnd I'm considering doing it\nin a very specific way, which\nwould be to only consume\ncaffeine on the days in which I\nresistance train.\nAnd since I tend to do that\nabout three or four days\nper week organized in a way\nthat's every other day-- again,\nif you want to see the exercise\nschedule that I follow,\nincluding cardiovascular\nexercise and weight\ntraining and all the reasons\nand rationale for what I do\nand how it maps on to the\nscientific literature,\nrelate to health span and\nlifespan, vitality, et cetera,\nyou can find that\nat hubermanlab.com.\nAnd we had a tool\nkit for fitness\nthat ought to be posted to\nour website before long.\nThe every-other-day schedule\nof caffeine intake, to me,\nseems like the most\nrational one if one\nwants to maximize on the\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine without suffering\nthe effects of caffeine\nwithdrawal that are\nassociated with being\na regular consumer of\ncaffeine and then stopping\ncaffeine intake, such as\nheadache and irritability\nand so forth.\nNot I nor anyone\nin my life wants\nme to experience\nthose effects, and I'm\nsure you don't\nwant to experience\nthose effects for you either.\nSo if you're\nsomebody that decides\nto try the every\nother day protocol\nor you are somebody who's\nalready doing that protocol,\nplease let me know what your\nexperiences with that are.\nAt least by my read of\nthe literature on caffeine\nand it's\nperformance-enhancing effects\nbut also the effects of caffeine\non neurotransmitter and hormone\nsystems, the every-other-day\ncaffeine schedule\ndoes seem to be the most\nrational and scientifically\ngrounded one in order to\nmaximize on all those effects.\nIn addition to so-called\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine, there are also\nthe well studied and now fairly\nwell mechanistically understood\npro-health effects of caffeine.\nNow, here when I talk about\npro-health effects of caffeine,\nI want to be very clear that,\nif your schedule of caffeine\nintake--\nthat is, your timing\nof caffeine intake\nor anything else\nfor that matter--\noffsets getting regular\nhigh quality sleep\nof sufficient duration,\nwell, then you\nare undermining the pro-health\neffects of that thing.\nThis is true for exercise.\nThis is true for caffeine.\nThis is true for\nsupplementation.\nThis is true for\nprescription drugs.\nAgain, you don't want to\nbe neurotically attached\nto the idea that you have to\nget perfect sleep every night\nbecause that's simply not\ntrue but is absolutely\nthe case that anything, whether\nor not it's good for you\nor bad for you in the short\nterm, that disrupts your sleep\nbecause of the timing in which\nyou're doing that thing is\ngoing to undermine your\nimmediate and long-term health\nbefore long.\nSo with that said,\nthere are several well\ndescribed health-promoting\neffects of caffeine ingestion.\nAnd once again, when I\nsay caffeine ingestion,\nI'm referring to that 1 to\n3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight dosage.\nThere are really nice studies\nshowing that being a regular\nconsumer of caffeine can help\noffset some of the probability,\nsome of the probability\nof developing\nParkinson's and maybe\nAlzheimer's-related dementia\nas well.\nThese are not terribly\ncontroversial data\nbecause of the\nfact that caffeine\nis known to increase the\nrelease of those catecholamines,\ndopamine, epinephrine, and\nnorepinephrine, as well\nas acetylcholine.\nAll those neurotransmitter\nand neuromodulator systems\nare the ones that are\nknown to be defective\nin Parkinson's and\nAlzheimer's, although there\nare other transmitter\nand hormone systems that\nare defective as well.\nThere are beautiful reviews\non the neuroprotective effects\nof caffeine and\nneurodegenerative diseases.\nThey're quite extensive.\nAnd I'll just refer you to one\nand the references therein,\nand we'll provide a link to\nthis in the show note caption.\nSo the title as the\ntopic at hand suggests\nis the neuroprotective\neffects of caffeine\nand neurodegenerative diseases.\nThis was published in 2016.\nI'm sure there have been\nother reviews since then,\nbut it includes many, many\nquality references and studies,\nboth in animals and in\nhumans, pointing to the fact\nthat specific enzymes\nthat are associated\nwith the health of, in\nparticular, dopamine neurons\nare made more robust by\nregular ingestion of caffeine.\nIt also points to the\nfact that the increase\nin dopamine receptors\nthat is induced\nby regular ingestion of caffeine\nthat I referred to earlier\nis another way in which\ndopamine, however many dopamine\nneurons remain around in people\nwith Parkinson's or people\nwho are aging that lose\ndopamine neurons naturally,\nthat dopamine can have\nits maximal effect because\nof the increase in receptors for\ndopamine that caffeine induces.\nAnd there are other\nbiological mechanisms\nthat further\nsupport why caffeine\nought to be\nneuroprotective, including\nits effects on the\nacetylcholine system, which\nis one of the major\nsystems disrupted\nin Alzheimer's dementia.\nSo in other words, it\nmakes perfect sense\nas to why caffeine would\nbe neuroprotective.\nCaffeine has also been\nshown to diminish headache,\nparticularly when taken in\ncombination with aspirin.\nAnd that's because of the\neffects of caffeine and aspirin\non blood flow.\nThere's also evidence\nthat caffeine\ncan provide brief but\nsubstantial relief from asthma.\nSo I wouldn't want people\nto rely on caffeine\nas a lifesaving approach\nto an asthmatic attack.\nThat said, for people that\nsuffer from minor asthma,\nthat caffeine intake--\nagain, of the dosages\nthat we talked\nabout before has been\nshown to alleviate some\nof the major symptoms\nof asthma for anywhere\nfrom one to four hours.\nAnd I know this is of relevance\nto a lot of people out there.\nBecause caffeine increases\nthe catecholamines\nand in particular because\ncaffeine increases\ndopamine transmission in\nthe prefrontal cortex--\nthis area of the brain that's\nassociated with focus and rule\nsetting and context\nand task switching--\ncaffeine is known to\nimprove focus and alertness,\nin particular, in\npeople who have\nsymptoms of ADHD or other\nattention and focus issues.\nNow caffeine alone\ndoes not appear\nto be as potent for\nthe treatment of ADHD\nas are things like Ritalin,\nAdderall, modafinil,\nor modafinil and Vyvanse.\nIf you would like a sort\nof head by head comparison\nof prescription\ndrugs, supplements,\nand things like\ncaffeine as well as\ncoverage of behavioral tools\nand nutritional tools, et cetera\nthat can positively offset\nsome of the symptoms of ADHD,\nplease see the episode\nthat I did on ADHD.\nAgain, that's available at\nhubermanlab.com in all formats.\nBut that said, caffeine\ndoes increase focus,\nand it does it through a\nnumber of different mechanisms,\nnot the least of which is to\nincrease dopamine transmission\nin the forebrain just as a drug\nlike Ritalin or Adderall would,\nalthough not to the same\nextent as a drug like Ritalin\nor Adderall does.\nBefore we close today, I do\nwant to just briefly return\nto the reinforcing\neffects of caffeine\nthat we talked about earlier.\nThis study on the\nhoneybees that showed\nthat bees prefer certain vectors\nbecause they contain caffeine.\nEven though they are not aware\nthat those vectors contain\ncaffeine, they just come to like\nthe feeling that those nectars\nprovide them so much\nthat they associate that\nin a subconscious way with\nthe flowers themselves,\nand they come to\nlike those flowers.\nOr human beings.\nFor instance, children that\ningest caffeinated beverages\ncome to adore the taste\nof those beverages.\nAnd beautiful studies have been\ndone that describe how children\nand adults truly cannot\ndistinguish between the taste\nof a caffeinated and\nnoncaffeinated beverage.\nAnd caffeine can be placed\ninto essentially any beverage\nin order to give us a preference\nfor that beverage or food.\nIn fact, the studies have\nbeen done with yogurt.\nIf you put caffeine into\nyogurt of different flavors--\neven plain yogurt which\nmost kids don't like--\nthey will come to prefer\nwhatever flavor contain\nthe caffeine even\nif then you remove\nthe caffeine from that flavor.\nNow eventually, their\npreference for that flavor\nwill be extinguished,\nbut all of this\nis just to say that so many\nof the things that we like,\nwhether or not it's coffee or\ntea or a given flavor of food\nor a given experience\nor even exercise,\noccur because we ingest\ncaffeine in conjunction\nwith those activities.\nNow these are not tricks\nthat your nervous system\nplays on you.\nThese are real\nneurochemical-reinforcing\neffects.\nAnd I think that we\nwould all do well\nto think about and to leverage\nthese reinforcing effects\nmuch in the same\nway we would do well\nto think about and hopefully\nnot leverage aversive effects\nof certain compounds, right?\nThe simple way to put\nthis is I or anyone\ncould get you to dislike\nsomething, someone,\nor some place by making you feel\nslightly less good, lower mood.\nI don't even have to make you\nfeel nauseous but less good\nafter ingesting\nsomething or having\na certain kind of interaction or\nbeing in a certain environment,\nvery straightforward to do\nthat, because of the way\nthat your nervous system\nis wired for conditioning.\nHowever, there's the\npositive side of all this,\nwhich is that it's very\nstraightforward to reinforce\nthe experience of a given\nfood, including its taste,\nbut all the context around it,\nthe container, the texture,\nthe people you consume it\nwith, where you consume it,\net cetera.\nFor instance, I\nwonder why we are not\npairing caffeine with broccoli.\nAnd here I'm not suggesting\nthat people actually\ndo that experiment or\nplay that trick on people,\nbut you have to sort of\nimagine that, if caffeine\nis this incredible reinforcer\nof all sorts of things,\nin particular, things that we\ningest and would want to ingest\nmore of if it's paired\nwith caffeine, well then,\nyou actually can use\ncaffeine as a tool\nto increase reinforcement\nof different things.\nAnd you can avoid caffeine as a\nway to further reinforce things\nthat you would like to stop.\nAnd here I'd like to just give\nthe example of sugar cravings.\nA lot of people ask me, how\ndo I avoid sugar cravings?\nI've talked about the use\nof L-glutamine for that.\nI've talked about\nmaking sure you're\ngetting enough essential fatty\nacids and essential amino acids\nas a way to reduce\nsugar cravings.\nPlease note,\nhowever, that if you\nare somebody who likes to have\nyour sugar, whether or not\nit's a piece of chocolate\nor your dessert, et cetera--\nI'm not saying that's\nbad, but if you're\ntrying to reduce your sugar\ncravings, ask yourself,\nare you ingesting sugar\nalong with caffeine?\nCould be the caffeine contained\nin that sugar-containing food\nlike chocolate.\nOr it could be\nthat you're having\na cup of coffee along\nwith your pastry,\nand then you're struggling\nwith sugar cravings.\nWell, think about it.\nYou're not just being reinforced\nby the sugar and the effects\nof sugar on dopamine\nwhich are real\nand both conscious\nand subconscious\nthrough the gut to the\nbrain dopamine system\nand direct on the\nbrain dopamine system.\nBut by coingesting\ncaffeine, you are also\nfurther enhancing the\nreinforcing effects of sugar.\nThe flip side to all of this\nis that you could use caffeine\nas a way to increase your\nappetite for certain things.\nI actually know somebody.\nI won't reveal who\nthis person is,\nbut they are quite\nprominent podcaster\nwho ingests 125 to 150\nmilligrams of in tablet\nform along with herbal\ntea and use this\nas a way to develop a\npreference for herbal tea\nbecause they found that\ncoffee was giving them\nother effects that\nweren't good for them.\nSo it works quite\nwell in animals,\nand it works quite\nwell in insects.\nAnd it works quite\nwell in humans.\nI suppose animals,\ninsects, and humans\nare all animals at the end of\nthe day, so no surprise there.\nBut it all underscores the\nextent to which caffeine\nis an absolutely\nfascinating molecule.\nI mean, its ability to\noffset the sleepiness system,\nif you will, this\nadenosine system,\nand to control our\nschedules in that way\nto essentially take a\nwithdrawal against the bank that\nis adenosine and\nthen pay that back\nlater in the form of\ngetting sleepy later as\nopposed to when we\nwant to be alert,\nits ability to enhance\nfocus, alertness, and mood.\nAnd if taken after trying to\nlearn something and remember\nit, to enhance\nmemory, especially.\nAnd its ability to increase\nVO2 max, increased strength.\nWe didn't even talk\ntoday about it,\nbut I'll just briefly\nmention that caffeine\ningested in the sorts of\ndoses we talked about earlier.\nBecause its effects on\nthe neuromuscular system\nand the calcium system\nassociated with neuromuscular\nexertion and fatigue can\nincrease peak power output\nand muscle contractability.\nIt's enhancing\nperformance there as well.\nAnd, of course, caffeine\ndoes a number of other things\njust generally related to\noverall and basal level of mood\nand alertness, not\nthe least of which are\nthese increases in dopamine.\nSo caffeine is really\nan incredible molecule.\nIt's affecting all these\nvarious neurotransmitter\nsystems but not haphazardly.\nIt's increasing dopamine and\nacetylcholine in the forebrain\nto increase attention.\nIt's reducing fatigue.\nIt's improving mental\nand physical performance\nfor some obvious and some\nnot so obvious reasons.\nAnd what I think is among the\nmore miraculous and powerful\neffects of caffeine, it is\na potent, potent, potent\nreinforcer of things, foods,\npeople, and experiences.\nAnd it's one that you can\nleverage in any direction\nthat you like once\nyou understand\nthe way that caffeine exerts\nthose reinforcing properties.\nSo today, I've really tried\nto cover as much as I could\nabout the mechanisms of caffeine\naction in the brain and body,\nas well as tools and\nschedules and dosages\nin which you can leverage\ncaffeine in order\nto meet your\nphysical performance,\nmental performance, and\nfrankly mental health,\nand overall health goals.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe
