    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor\nof Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is\nDr. Lex Fridman Dr.\nLex Fridman is an expert\nin electrical and computer\nengineering, artificial\nintelligence, and robotics.\nHe is also the host of the\nLex Fridman Podcast, which\ninitially started\nas a podcast focus\non technology and\nscience of various kinds,\nincluding computer\nscience and physics,\nbut rapidly evolved to include\nguests and other topics\nas a matter of focus,\nincluding sport.\nFor instance, Dr. Lex\nFreedman is a Black Belt\nin Brazilian jujitsu.\nAnd he's had numerous\nguests on who\ncome from the fields\nof Brazilian jujitsu,\nboth from the coaching side\nand from the competitor side.\nHe also has shown\nan active interest\nin topics such as chess\nand essentially anything\nthat involves intense activation\nand engagement of the mind\nand/or body.\nIn fact, the Lex\nFridman podcast has\nevolved to take on\nvery difficult topics\nsuch as mental health-- he's\nhad various psychiatrists\nand other guests on that\nrelate to mental health\nand mental illness, as well as\nguest focused on geopolitics\nand some of the more\ncontroversial issues\nthat face our times.\nHe's had comedians, he's had\nscientists, he's had friends,\nhe's had enemies on his podcast.\nLex has a phenomenal, I would\nsay a 1 in an eight billion\nability to find these people,\nmake them comfortable,\nand in that comfort, both\ntry to understand them\nand to confront them and to\npush them so that we all learn.\nAll of which is to say that\nLex Fridman is no longer just\nan accomplished scientist,\nhe certainly is that.\nBut he has also become one of\nthe more preeminent thought\nleaders on the planet.\nAnd if there's anything\nthat really captures\nthe essence of Lex\nFridman, it's his love\nof learning, his desire to share\nwith us, the human experience,\nand to broaden that experience\nso that we all may benefit.\nIn many ways, our discussion\nduring today's episode\ncaptures the many\nfacets of Lex Fridman,\nalthough no conversation, of\ncourse, could capture them all.\nWe sit down to the\nconversation just days\nafter Lex returned from\nUkraine, where he deliberately\nplaced himself into the\ntension of that environment\nin order to understand the\ngeopolitics of the region\nand to understand\nexactly what was\nhappening at the level of the\nground and the people there.\nYou may notice that he carries\nquite a lot of both, emotion\nand knowledge and understanding.\nAnd yet in a very\nclassic Lex Fridman way,\nyou'll notice that\nhe's able to zoom out\nof his own experience around\nany number of different topics\nand view them through\na variety of lenses\nso that first of all, everyone\nfeel included, but most of all,\nso that everyone learned\nsomething new, that\nis to gain new perspective.\nOur discussion also ventures\ninto the waters of social media\nand how that\nlandscape is changing\nthe way that science and\ntechnology are communicated.\nWe also get into the topics of\nmotivation drive and purpose,\nboth finding it and executing\non that drive and purpose.\nI should mention that this is\nepisode 100 of the Huberman Lab\nPodcast.\nAnd I would be remiss\nif I did not tell you\nthat there would be no\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nwere it not for Lex Fridman.\nI was a fan of the\nLex Fridman Podcast\nlong before I was ever invited\non to the podcast as a guest.\nAnd after our first\nrecording, Lex\nwas the one that suggested\nthat I start a podcast.\nHe only gave me two\npieces of advice.\nThe first piece of advice\nwas, start a podcast.\nAnd the second\npiece of advice was\nthat I not just make it me\nblabbing into the microphone\nand staring at the camera.\nSo I can safely say\nthat I at least followed\nhalf of his advice, and that\nI am ever grateful for Lex,\nboth as a friend, a\ncolleague in science,\nand now fellow podcaster for\nmaking the suggestion that we\nstart this podcast.\nI already mentioned\na few of the topics\ncovered on today's podcast.\nBut I can assure you that\nthere is far more to the person\nthat many of us\nknow as Lex Fridman.\nIf you are somebody interested\nin artificial intelligence,\nengineering, or robotics,\ntoday's discussion\nis most certainly for you.\nAnd if you are not,\nbut you are somebody\nwho is interested in world\npolitics, and more importantly,\nthe human experience,\nboth the individual\nand the collective\nhuman experience,\nLex shares what can\nonly be described\nas incredible insights\ninto what he views\nas the human experience and what\nis optimal in order to derive\nfrom our time on this planet.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nwith everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means the electrolytes,\nsodium, potassium,\nand magnesium are in LMNT\nin the correct ratios.\nBut it has no sugar.\nAs I mentioned before\non the podcast,\nelectrolytes are\ncritical to the function\nof every cell in the\nbody, and especially\nthe cells in your brain,\nmeaning neurons or nerve cells.\nIndeed, the ability\nfor nerve cells\nto be active and communicate\nwith one another critically\ndepends on sodium,\npotassium, and magnesium.\nYou can get electrolytes\nfrom a variety of sources.\nBut it's often hard to get\nthem in the proper ratios,\neven from food.\nSo if you're somebody who's\nexercising a lot and sweating,\nor if you're somebody\nfollowing, for instance,\na low carbohydrate or even a\nsemi-low carbohydrate diet,\nthat will cause you to\nexcrete electrolytes.\nI tend to have my\nLMNT first thing\nin the morning when I wake up\nor within the first few hours\nof waking, any time while\nor after I'm exercising,\nor I've sweat a lot, such\nas exiting the sauna.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT\nyou can go to drinkLMNT--\nthat's LMNT..com/Huberman to\nclaim a free element sample\npack with your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinkLMNT,\nLMNT.com/Huberman to my free\nsample pack.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Levels.\nLevels is a program\nthat lets you\nsee how different foods affect\nyour health by giving you\nreal-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose\nmonitor.\nNow blood glucose or blood\nsugar is a critical aspect\nof your immediate\nand long term health,\nand indeed, your\nfeelings of vigor\nand mental clarity and\nwell-being at any moment.\nOne of the key things is to know\nhow different foods and food\ncombinations and\ntiming of food intake\nis impacting blood glucose.\nAnd with Levels,\nyou're able to assess\nall of that in real time.\nI tried Levels.\nAnd what it taught\nme, for instance,\nwas that I can eat certain\nfoods at certain times of day.\nBut if I eat them at\nother times a day,\nI get a blood sugar crash.\nIt also taught me,\nfor instance, how\nto space my exercise\nand my food intake.\nIt turns out for me, exercising\nfasted is far more beneficial.\nThat's something I\nlearned using Levels.\nAnd it's completely\ntransformed, not\njust the spacing and timing\nof my diet and exercise,\nbut also use of things like\nthe sauna and other activities.\nIt's been a tremendous\nlearning for me\nthat's really shaped an enormous\nnumber of factors in my life\nthat have led to me feeling\nfar more vigorous with far more\nmental focus and physical\nstrength and endurance.\nSo if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\ngo to levels.link/Huberman.\nAgain that's levels.link,\nL-I-N-K/Huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep make smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've talked many\ntimes on this podcast\nabout the critical relationship\nbetween sleep and body\ntemperature.\nThat is in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep\nthroughout the night,\nour body temperature\nneeds to drop by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd conversely when we\nwake up in the morning,\nthat is in large part,\nbecause of our body heating up\nby 1 to 3 degrees.\nNow people have different\ncore body temperatures.\nAnd they tend to run colder or\nhotter throughout the night.\nEight Sleep allows you\nto adjust the temperature\nof your sleeping\nenvironment so that you\nhave the optimal temperature\nthat gets you the best night's\nsleep.\nI started sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover about eight months ago.\nAnd it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nI sleep so much deeper,\nI wake up far less\nduring the middle of\nthe night, if at all,\nand I wake up feeling far\nbetter than I ever have,\neven after the same\namount of sleep.\nIf you want to try\nEight Sleep, you can go\nto eightsleep.com/Huberman to\nsave up to $400 off their sleep\nfit holiday bundle, which\nincludes their new Pod 3 cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, United Kingdom,\nselect countries in the EU,\nand Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/Huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion with\nDr. Lex Fridman, welcome back.\nLEX FRIDMAN: It's good\nto be back in a bedroom.\nThis feels like a porn set.\nI apologize to open that way.\nI've never been in a porn\nset, so I should admit this.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Our\nstudio has being renovated.\nSo here we are for the\nmonumental recording\nof episode 100--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Episode\n100 of the Huberman Lab\nPodcast, which was inspired\nby the Lex Fridman Podcast.\nSome people already\nknow the story.\nBut I'll repeat it again\nfor those that don't.\nThere would not be a\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nwere it not for Lex Fridman.\nBecause after recording\nas a guest on his podcast\na few years ago, he\nmade the suggestion\nthat I start a podcast.\nAnd he explained\nto me how it works.\nAnd he said, \"You\nshould start a podcast.\nBut just make sure\nthat it's not you\nblabbing the whole\ntime, Andrew.\"\nAnd I only sort of\nfollowed the advice.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,\nwell, you surprised me,\nsurprised the world, that\nyou're able to talk for hours\nand cite some of the\nbest science going on\nand be able to\ngive people advice\nwithout many interruptions\nor edits or any of that.\nI mean, that takes an\nincredible amount of skill\nthat you're probably born with.\nAnd some of it is developed.\nI mean, the whole science\ncommunity is proud of you, man.\nStanford is proud of you.\nSo yeah, it's a beautiful thing.\nIt was really surprising.\nBecause it's unclear\nhow a scientist can\ndo a great podcast\nthat's not just\nshooting the shit\nabout random stuff,\nbut really is giving very\nstructured, good advice\nthat's boiling down the\nstate of the art science\ninto something that's\nactually useful for people.\nSo that was impressive.\nIt's like holy shit, he\nactually pulled this off.\nAnd doing it every week\non a different topic--\nI mean, I'm usually\npositive, especially\nfor people I love and support.\nBut damn, I thought,\nthere's no way\nhe's going to be able to pull\nthis off week after week.\nAnd it's been only getting\nbetter and better and better.\nHad a whole rant on a recent\npodcast, I forget with who,\nof how awesome you are\nwith Rana el Kaliouby.\nShe's a emotion recognition\nperson, AI person.\nAnd then she didn't\nknow who you were.\nAnd I was like, what\nthe hell do you mean?\nAnd I just went on this whole\nrant of how awesome you are.\nIs hilarious.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm\nvery gratified to hear this.\nI'm-- it's a little\nuncomfortable for me to hear\nbut listen, I'm just really\nhappy if people are getting\ninformation that they like\nand can make actionable.\nAnd it was inspired by you.\nAnd look right back at you.\nI've followed a number of\nyour structural formats.\nAttire, I don't wear a tie.\nI'm constantly reminded\nabout this by my father.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Who says\nwhat-- he'd saw my podcast.\nAnd he was like, why\ndon't you dress properly\nlike your friend Lex?\nHe literally said that.\nAnd it's a debate that\ngoes back and forth.\nBut nonetheless--\nLEX FRIDMAN: How does it feel?\nEpisode 100.\nHow does it feel?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou know, I think.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Can you\nimagine you're here?\nYou hear after so many\nepisodes and done so much.\nI mean, the number of\nhours is just insane.\nThe amount of\npassion, the amount\nof work you put into\nthis, what's it feel like?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It feels great.\nAnd it feels very much\nlike the horizon is still\nat the same distance\nin front of me.\nEvery episode, I just try\nand get information there.\nAnd the process that we\ntalked about on your podcast.\nWe won't go into it of\ncollecting information,\ndistilling it down\nto some simple notes,\nwalking around,\nlistening to music,\ntrying to figure out\nwhat the motifs are,\nand then-- as just like you,\nI don't use a teleprompter\nor anything like that.\nThere's very minimal notes.\nSo it feels great,\nand I love it.\nAnd again, I'm just grateful\nto you for inspiring it.\nAnd I just want to keep\ngoing and do more of it.\nAnd I should say\nI am also relieved\nthat we're sitting here because\nyou recently went overseas\nto a very intense war zone,\nliterally, the Ukraine.\nAnd the entire time\nthat you were there,\nI was genuinely concerned.\nThe world's a unpredictable\nplace, in general.\nAnd we don't always get the only\nvote and what happens to us.\nSo first of all,\nwelcome back safely,\none peace, one alive peace.\nAnd what was that like?\nI mean, at a broad level,\nat a specific level,\nwhat drew you there?\nWhat surprised you?\nAnd how do you think it changed\nyou in coming back here?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I think\nthere's a lot to say.\nBut first, it is\nreally good to be back.\nOne of the things\nthat when you go\nto a difficult part of the world\nor a part of the world that's\ngoing through\nsomething difficult,\nyou really appreciate how\ngreat it is to be an American.\nEverything.\nThe easy access to food.\nDespite what people think, the\nstable, reliable rule of law.\nThe lack of corruption in that\nyou can trust that if you start\na business or if you take\non various pursuits in life\nthat there's not going to\nbe at-scale manipulation\nof your efforts such\nthat you can't succeed.\nSo this kind of\ncapitalism is in it's--\nthe ideal of capitalism is\nreally still burning bright\nin this country.\nAnd it really makes you\nappreciate those aspects.\nAnd also just the ability to\nhave a home for generations,\nacross generations.\nSo you can have your\ngrandfather live\nin Kentucky in a certain city.\nAnd then his children lived\nthere, and you live there,\nand then it just\ncontinues on and on.\nThat's the kind of thing you can\nhave when you don't have war.\nBecause war destroys\nentire communities.\nAnd it destroys\nhistories, generations,\nlike life stories that stretch\nacross the generations.\nSo--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah.\nI didn't even think about\nthat until you said just now.\nBut photographs, hard drives\nget destroyed or just abandoned.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries.\nI mean, nowadays, things\nexist in the cloud\nbut are still a lot of--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--material goods\nthat are irreplaceable, right.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural\nparts of the United States,\nthey don't exist in\nthe cloud, right.\nA lot of people still, well,\neven in towns, they still\nlove the physical photo\nalbum of your family.\nA lot of people still\nstore their photographs\nof families in the VHS tapes and\nall that kind of stuff, yeah.\nBut I think-- there's so many\nthings I've learned and really\nfelt the lessons.\nOne of which is nobody gives a\ndamn when your photos are gone\nand all that kind of\nstuff, your house is gone.\nThe thing time and time\nagain I saw for people\nthat lost everything is how\nhappy they are for the people.\nThey love the friends, the\nfamily that are still alive.\nThat's the only thing\nthey talk about.\nThat, in fact, they\ndon't mention actually\nwith much dramatic sort\nof vigor about the trauma\nof losing your home.\nThey're just non-stop saying\nhow lucky they are that person X\nperson Y is still here.\nAnd that makes you realize\nthat when you lose everything,\nit's still--\nit makes you realize\nwhat really matters,\nwhich is the people\nin your life.\nI mean, a lot of people kind\nof realize that later in life,\nwhen you're facing mortality,\nwhen you're facing your death,\nor you get a cancer\ndiagnosis, that kind of stuff.\nI think people here in\nAmerica, in California,\nwith the fires, you you\ncan still lose your home.\nYou are going to\nrealize, like, nah.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nIt's a pain in the ass\nbut what matters is still\nthe family, the\npeople, and so on.\nI think the most intense thing--\nI talked to several hundred\npeople, some of which\nis recorded.\nI've really been\nstruggling to put that out\nbecause I have to\nedit it myself.\nAnd so you're talking about 30,\n40 hours of footage, and it--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is\nemotionally struggling?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nIt is extremely difficult.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you\nlike emotional struggle?\nLEX FRIDMAN: It's\nextremely difficult.\nSo I talked to a\nlot of politicians.\nThe number two in the\ncountry, number three.\nI'll be back there to\ntalk to the president\nto do a three-hour conversation.\nThose are easy to edit.\nThey're really heartfelt\nand thoughtful folks\nfrom different perspectives\non the geopolitics of the war.\nBut the ones that\nreally hard to edit\nis like grandmas that are\nin the middle of nowhere.\nThey lost everything.\nThey still have hope,\nthey still have love.\nAnd some of them have--\nsome of them, many of\nthem, unfortunately,\nhave now hate in their heart.\nSo in February, when\nRussia invaded Ukraine,\nthis is the thing I\nrealized about War.\nOne of the most\npainful one lessons\nis that war creates\ngenerational hate.\nWe sometimes think about war\nas a thing that kills people,\nkills civilians, kills\nsoldiers, takes away lives,\ninjures people.\nBut we don't\ndirectly think about\nthe secondary and\ntertiary effects\nof that which lasts decades.\nWhich is anyone who's lost\nthe father or a mother\nor a daughter or a son,\nthey now hate not just\nthe individual\nsoldiers or the leaders\nthat invaded their country but\nthe entirety of the people.\nSo it's not that they\nhate Vladimir Putin\nor hate the Russian military.\nThey hate Russian people.\nSo that tears the\nfabric of a thing\nthat, for me-- my half\nmy family's from Ukraine,\nhalf of my family\nis from Russia.\nBut there is--\nI remember the pain the\ntriumph of World War two\nstill resonates through\nmy entire family tree.\nAnd so, you remember when\nthe Russians and Ukrainians\nfought together against\nthis Nazi invasion.\nYou remember a lot of that.\nAnd now, to see the fabric\nof this peoples torn apart\ncompletely with hate is really,\nreally difficult. For me,\njust to realize that\nthings will just never\nbe the same on this particular\ncultural, historical aspect.\nBut also, there's so many\npainful ways in which\nthings will never be the same.\nWhich is we've seen that\nit's possible to have\na major hot war in\nthe 21st century.\nI think a lot of people\nare watching this.\nChina is watching this.\nIndia is watching this.\nUnited States is watching this\nand thinking we can actually\nhave a large-scale war.\nAnd I think the lessons\nlearned from that.\nMight be the kind that lead\nto a major World War III\nin the 21st century.\nSo one of the things I realized\nwatching the whole scene\nis that we don't know\nshit about what's going\nto happen in the 21st century.\nAnd it might-- we kind of have\nthis intuition like surely\nthere's not going\nto be another war.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Like\nwe'll just coast.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic.\nYeah--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd back to normal.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhatever that is.\nLEX FRIDMAN: But you\nhave to remember,\nat the end of World War I,\nas Woodrow Wilson called it,\nthe war to end all wars.\nNobody ironically,\nin a dark way,\nit was also the roaring 20s\nwhen people believed this.\nThere will never be\nanother World War.\nAnd 20 years after that,\nthe rise of Nazi Germany.\nA charismatic leader\nthat captivated\nthe minds of\nmillions and built up\na military that can\ntake on the whole world.\nAnd so it makes you realize\nthat this is still possible.\nThis is still possible.\nAnd then the tension.\nYou see this-- the media\nmachine, the propaganda\nmachine, that I've gotten\nto see every aspect of.\nIt's still fueling that division\nbetween America and China.\nBetween Russia and India.\nAnd then Africa has\na complicated thing\nthat's trying to figure\nout who are they with,\nwho are they against.\nAnd just this tension is\nbuilding and building.\nAnd like it makes you\nrealize like we might--\nthe thing that might\nshake human civilization\nmay not be so far off.\nThat's a realization\nyou get to really feel.\nI mean, there's all\nkinds of other lessons.\nAnd one of which is propaganda.\nIs I got to--\nI get a lot of letters, emails.\nAnd some of them are full\nof really intense language,\nfull of hate from\nevery side toward me.\nOr, well, the hate is\ntowards me as representing\nside X. And X stands as a\nvariable for every side.\nSo either I'm a Zelensky\nshow, or I'm a Putin show,\nor I'm a NATO show,\nor I'm an America--\nAmerica show--\nAmerican empire show.\nOr I'm a Democrat\nor a Republican.\nBecause it's already been,\nin this country, politicized.\nI think there's a sense of\nUkraine is this place that's\nfull of corruption.\nWhy are we sending money there?\nI think that's kind\nof the messaging\non the Republican side.\nOn the Democratic side--\nI'm not even keeping track\nof the actual messaging\nand the conspiracy theories\nand the narratives,\nbut they are-- the\ntension is there.\nAnd I get to feel it directly.\nAnd what you get to\nreally experience\nis there's a large\nnumber of narratives\nthat all are extremely\nconfident themselves that they\nknow the truth.\nPeople are convinced,\nfirst of all,\nthat they're not being lied to.\nPeople in Russia think\nthere's no propaganda.\nThey think that,\nyes, yes, there is\nlike state-sponsored\npropaganda, but we're all\nsmart enough to ignore the lame\npropaganda that's everywhere.\nThey know that we can think\non our own, we know the truth,\nand everybody kind of\nspeaks in this way.\nEverybody in the\nUnited States says,\nwell, yes, there's\nmainstream media,\nthey're full of messaging and\npropaganda, but we're smart.\nWe can think on our own.\nOf course, we see through that.\nEverybody says this.\nAnd then the conclusion\nof their thought\nis often hatred towards some\ngroup, whatever that group is.\nAnd the more you've\nlost, the more\nintense the feeling of hatred.\nIt's a really\ndifficult field to walk\nthrough calmly and\nwith an open mind\nand try to understand\nwhat's really going on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's super intense.\nThat's the only words that\ncome to mind as I hear this.\nYou mentioned something that\nit seems that hate generalizes.\nIt's against an entire\ngroup or an entire country.\nWhy do you think it is that\nhate generalizes and that love\nmay or may not generalize?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I've\nhad-- sort of one,\nas you can imagine, the\nkind of question I asked\nis, do you have love\nor hate in your heart?\nIt's a question I\nasked almost everybody.\nAnd then I would dig\ninto this exact question\nthat you're asking.\nI think some of the most\nbeautiful things I've\nheard which is people\nthat are full of hate\nare able to\nself-introspect about it.\nThey know they shouldn't feel\nit, but they can't help it.\nIt's not-- they know that\nultimately the thing that\nhelps them and helps everyone\nis to feel love for fellow man,\nbut they can't help it.\nThey know.\nIt's like a drug, they\nsay like hate escalates,\nit's like a vicious spiral.\nYou just can't help it.\nAnd the question I\nalso asked is, do you\nthink you'll ever be\nable to forgive Russia?\nAnd after much thought almost--\nit's split, but most\npeople will say no.\nI will never be able to forgive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And because\nof the generalization\nyou talked about earlier, that\ncould even include all Ru--\nLEX FRIDMAN: All Russians.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIn that statements,\nthey mean all Russians.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Because\nif you do nothing\nthat's as bad or worse\nthan being part of the army\nthat invades.\nSo the people that are\njust sitting there,\nthe good Germans, the people\nthat are just quietly going\non with their lives, you're\njust as bad, if not worse,\nis their perspective.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nEarlier, you said\nthat going over\nto the Ukraine now\nallowed you to\nrealize just so many\nof the positives of being\nhere in the United States.\nI have a good friend.\nWe both know him.\nI won't name him\nby name, but we've\ncommunicated the\nthree of us from\ntier-one Special Operations.\nHe spent years\ndoing deployments.\nReally amazing individual.\nAnd I remember when the pandemic\nhit, he said on a text thread\nyou know, Americans aren't used\nto the government interfering\nwith their plans.\nAround the world,\nmany people are\nfamiliar with governments\ndramatically interfering\nwith their plans.\nSometimes even in a\nseemingly random way.\nHere we were not\nbraced for that.\nI mean, we get speeding\ntickets, and there's lines\nto vote and things like that.\nBut I think the pandemic\nwas one of the first times,\nat least in my life, that I\ncan remember where it really\nseemed like the government was\nimpeding what people naturally\nwanted to do.\nAnd that was a shock\nfor people here.\nAnd I have a what might\nseem like a somewhat\nmundane question,\nbut it's something\nthat I saw on social media.\nA lot of people were\nasking me to ask you,\nand I was curious about too.\nWhat was a typical\nday like over there?\nWere sleeping in a bed, were\nyou sleeping on the ground?\nEveryone seems to want to know.\nWhat were you eating?\nWere you eating once a day?\nWere you eating your steak?\nOr were you-- were you in fairly\ndeprived conditions over there?\nI saw a couple photos\nthat you posted out\nof doors in front of rubble.\nWith pith helmet on in one case.\nWhat was that typical\nday like over there?\nLEX FRIDMAN: So\nthere's two modes.\nOne of them-- I spent\na lot of time in Kyiv,\nwhich is much safer than--\nit may be obvious to state\nbut for people who don't know,\nit's in the middle\nof the country,\nand it's much safer\nthan the actual front.\nThe word the battle\nis happening.\nSo much, much safer\nthan Kyiv even\nis Lviv which is the\nWestern part of the country.\nSo the times I\nspent in Kyiv were\nfundamentally different than\nthe time I spent at the front.\nAnd I went to the\nKherson region,\nwhich is where a lot of really\nheated battle was happening.\nThere's several areas.\nSo there's Kharkiv.\nIt's in the Northeast\nof the country.\nAnd then there's Donbas region,\nwhich is East of the country.\nAnd then there's Kherson\nregion, which, by the way,\nI'm not good at geography, so\nis the Southeast of the country.\nAnd that's where, at\nleast when I was there,\nwas a lot of really\nheated fighting happening.\nSo when I was in\nthe Kherson region,\nit's what you would imagine.\nThe place-- I stayed in a\nhotel where all the lights\nhave to stay off.\nSo the entire town,\nall the lights are off.\nYou have to navigate\nthrough the darkness\nand use your phone\nto shine, and so on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This is\nterrible for the circadian\nsystem.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLEX FRIDMAN: That's exactly--\nI was this-- how can I do this?\nWhere's my element\nand Athletic Greens?\nHow can I function?\nNo.\nThere's I think it was balanced\nby the deep appreciation\nof being alive.\n[LAUGHTER]\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRight now I-- mean,\nthis is the reason\nthat I asked--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis is the reason\nI ask is we get used to all\nthese creature comforts.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nwe don't need them,\nbut we often come\nto depend on them\nin a way that makes us\nfeel like we need them.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,\nbut very quickly,\nthere's something about\nthe intensity of life\nthat you see in people's\neyes because they're\nliving through a war that makes\nyou forget all those creature\ncomforts.\nAnd it was actually--\nI'm somebody who hates\ntraveling and so on.\nI love the creature habits.\nI love-- I love the\ncomfort of the ritual right\nbut all of that was\nforgotten very quickly.\nJust the intensity of\nfeeling, the intensity of\nlove that people have for\neach other, that was obvious.\nIn terms of food--\nso there's a curfew.\nSo depends on what\npart of the country.\nBut usually, you basically have\nto scamper home like 9:00 PM.\nSo the hard curfew in a lot of\nplaces is 11:00 PM at night.\nBut by then, you\nhave to be home.\nSo-- in some places, it's 10:00.\nSo at 9:00 PM, you\nstart going home.\nWhich, for me, was\nkind of wonderful\nalso because I get to spend--\nI get to be forced to spend time\nalone and think for many hours\nin wherever I'm staying.\nWhich is really nice.\nAnd everywhere there's a\ncalmness and the quietness\nto the whole thing.\nIn terms of food, once a day.\nJust the food is incredibly\ncheap and incredibly delicious.\nPeople are still--\none of the things\nthey can still take pride\nin is making the best\npossible food they can.\nSo meat-- but they do\nadmire American meat,\nso the meat is not as great as\nit could be in that country.\nBut I ate borsch every day,\nall that kind of stuff.\nMostly meat.\nSo spend the entire day--\nwake up in the\nmorning with coffee,\nspend the entire day\ntalking to people.\nWhich for me is very\ndifficult because\nof the intensity of the story.\nIt's one after the\nother after the other.\nWe just talk to regular\npeople, talk to soldiers,\ntalk to politicians,\nall kinds of soldiers.\nI talked to people there who\nare doing rescue missions, so\nAmericans.\nI hung out with Tim Kennedy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah?\nThe great Tim Kennedy.\nLEX FRIDMAN: The great\nTim Kennedy, who--\nalso him and many\nothers revealed to me\none of the many\nreasons I'm proud to be\nan American is how trained\nand skilled and effective\nAmerican soldiers are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I guess for\nlisteners of this podcast maybe\nwe should familiarize\nthem with who\nTim Kennedy is because I\nrealized that a number of them\nwill know, but--\nLEX FRIDMAN: How do you do that?\nHow do you try to\nsummarize a man?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nWe can be accurate\nbut not exhaustive,\nas any good data are\naccurate but not exhaustive.\nVery skilled and accomplished\nMMA fighter, very skilled\nand accomplished former\nSpecial Operations member,\nAmerican Patriot, and\npodcaster too, right?\nDoes he have his own podcast?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Maybe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Maybe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We know Andy\nStumpf has his own podcast.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Which is\nan amazing podcast.\nYeah, Andy's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nClearing Hot podcast\nwith Andy Stumpf.\nLEX FRIDMAN: But\nalso Tim Kennedy\nis like the embodiment of\nAmerica to the most beautiful\nand the most ridiculous degree.\nSo he's like what you imagine--\nwhat is it, Team America?\nI just imagine him\nshirtless on a tank rolling\ninto enemy territory\njust screaming\nat the top of his lungs.\nThat's just his personality.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut not posturing.\nHe actually does the\nwork, as they say.\nLEX FRIDMAN: So\nthis is the thing.\nHe really embodies that.\nNow, some of that is just\nhis personality and humor.\nI'd like to sort of comment\non the humor of things,\nnot just with him.\nThere's very one other\ninteresting thing I've learned.\nBut also when he's\nactually helping people\nhe's extremely good\nat what he does,\nwhich is building\nteams that rescue, that\ngo into the most dangerous areas\nof Ukraine, dangerous areas\nanywhere else, and\nthey get the job done.\nAnd one of the things I\nheard time and time again,\nwhich what's really\ninteresting to me,\nthat Ukrainian soldiers said\nthat comparing Ukrainian,\nRussian, and American\nsoldiers, American soldiers\nare the bravest, which was\nvery interesting for me\nto hear given how\nhigh the morale is\nfor the Ukrainian soldiers.\nBut that just\nreveals that training\nenables you to be brave.\nSo it's not just about how well\ntrained they are and so on,\nit's how intense and ferocious\nthey are in the fighting.\nAnd it makes you realize,\nthis is American army,\nnot just through the technology,\nespecially the special force\nguys.\nThey're still one of\nthe most effective\nand terrifying\narmies in the world.\nAnd listen, just\nfor context, I'm\nsomebody who is, for the most\npart, anti-war, a pacifist.\nBut you get to see some of the\nrealities of war kind of wake\nyou up to what needs to get\ndone to protect sovereignty,\nto protect some of the values,\nto protect civilians and homes\nand all that kind of stuff.\nSometimes war has to happen.\nAnd I should also\nmention the Russian side\nbecause while I haven't gotten\nto experience the Russian side\nyet I do fully plan to travel to\nRussia, as I've told everybody.\nI was very upfront with\neverybody about this.\nI would like to hear\nthe story of Russians.\nBut I do know from the Ukrainian\nside, like the grandmas--\nI love grandmas.\nThey told me stories that\nthe Russians really--\nthe ones that entered their\nvillages, they really, really\nbelieved they're saving\nUkraine from Nazis,\nfrom Nazi occupation.\nSo they feel that\nUkraine is under control\nof Nazi organizations\nand they believe\nthey're saving\nthe country that's\ntheir brothers and sisters.\nI think propaganda and I think\ntruth is a very difficult thing\nto arrive with in that war zone.\nI think in the 21st\ncentury one of the things\nyou realize that so much of war,\neven more so than in the past,\nis an information war.\nAnd people that just use Twitter\nfor their source of information\nmight be surprised to know\nhow much misinformation there\nis on Twitter, like real\nnarratives being sold,\nand so it's really hard\nto know who to believe.\nAnd through all of that you\nhave to try to keep an open mind\nand ultimately\nignore the powerful\nand listen to actual\ncitizens, actual people.\nThat's the other\nmaybe obvious lesson\nis that war is waged by\npowerful, rich people,\nand it's the poor\npeople that suffer.\nAnd that's just visible\ntime and time again.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned\nthe fact that people still\nenjoy food or the\npleasure of cooking,\nor there's occasional humor\nor maybe frequent humor.\nI know Jocko Willink has\ntalked about this in warfare\nin that all the elements of\nthe human spirit and condition\nstill emerge at various times.\nI find this amazing,\nand you and I\nhave had conversations\nabout this before,\nbut the aperture of the mind.\nThe classic story\nthat comes to mind\nis the one of Viktor\nFrankl or Nelson Mandela.\nYou put somebody into a\nsmall box of confinement\nand some people break\nunder those conditions\nand other people\nfind entire stories\nwithin a centimeter\nof concrete that\ncan occupy them, real stories\nand richness or humor or love\nor fascination and surprise.\nAnd I find this so interesting\nthat the mind is so adaptable.\nWe talked about creature\ncomforts and then lack\nof creature comforts and\nthe way that we can adapt,\nand yet, humans are\nalways striving,\nit seems, or one would hope,\nfor these better conditions\nto better their conditions.\nSo as you've come back--\nand you've been here\nnow back in the States\nfor how long after your trip?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Depends\non this podcast\nrelease but it felt\nlike I've never\nleft, so practically\nspeaking, a couple months.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nYeah.\nAnd we won't be shy.\nWe're recording\nthis mid-September.\nLEX FRIDMAN: We actually\nrecorded this several years ago\nso we're anticipating\nin the future.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis is where we're\ngoing to start telling you this\nis a simulation, you and Joe.\nI'm still trying to figure\nout what that actually means.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens,\nonce or usually twice a day,\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long term health,\nand those probiotics\nin Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains\na number of adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met, and it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try\nAthletic Greens you can go\nto athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand they'll give you five free\ntravel packs that make it really\neasy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera,\nand they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3, K2.\nI know I speak for\nmany people when\nI say that we are very\nhappy that you're back.\nWe know that it's not going\nto be the first and last trip,\nthat there will be\nothers, and that you'll\nbe going to Russia as well\nand presumably other places\nas well in order to explore.\nAnd I have to say, as a\npodcaster and as your friend,\nI was really inspired at\nyour sense of adventure\nand your sense of\nnot just adventure,\nbut thoughtful,\nrespectful adventure.\nYou understood what\nyou were doing.\nYou weren't just going there\nto get some wartime footage\nor something.\nThis wasn't a kick or a thrill.\nThis is really serious\nand remains serious.\nSo thank you for doing it,\nand please, next time you go,\nbring Tim Kennedy again.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I feel like\nTim Kennedy gets you into--\nwill take you because\nhe really loves\ngoing to the most dangerous\nplaces and helping people.\nSo I think he'd get me into\nmore trouble than it's worth.\nAnd I should mention\nthat, I mean,\nthere's many reasons I\nwent, but it's definitely\nnot something I take\nlightly or want to do again.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nLEX FRIDMAN: So I'm doing\nthings that I don't want to do,\nI just feel like I have to.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou're compelled.\nLEX FRIDMAN: So I\ndon't think there's--\nnow I'll definitely talk\nabout it, as we all should.\nThere's different\nareas of the world that\nare seeing a lot of suffering.\nYemen.\nThere's so many atrocities\ngoing on in the world today,\nbut this one is just\npersonal to me so I want to--\nI feel like I'm qualified\njust because of the language.\nSo most of the talking,\nby the way, I was doing,\nit was in Russian.\nAnd so because of the language,\nbecause of my history,\nI felt like I had to do\nthis particular thing.\nI think it's, in many ways,\nstupid and dangerous, and that\nwas made clear to me.\nBut I do many things\nof this nature\nbecause the heart\npulls towards that.\nBut also there's\na freedom to not--\nI'm afraid of death, but I\nthink there's a freedom to--\nit's almost like,\nOK, if I die, I\nwant to take full advantage of\nnot having a family currently.\nI feel like when you\nhave a family there's\na responsibility for others\nso you immediately become\nmore conservative and careful.\nI feel like I want to\ntake full advantage\nof this particular\nmoment in my life\nwhen you can be a little\nbit more accepting of risk.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nyou should definitely\nreproduce at some point.\nMaybe before next time you\nshould just freeze some sperm.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Is that what\nyou do with ice baths?\nIs how that works?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nknow, it's interesting.\nThere's always an opportunity\nto do some science protocols.\nYou know that there are\nproducts on the internet,\nand there are actually a few\ndecent manuscripts looking\nat how cold exposure can\nincrease testosterone levels,\nbut it doesn't happen\nby the cold directly.\nGood scientists, as the authors\nof those papers, were and are,\nrealized that it's the\nvasoconstriction and then\nthe vasodilation.\nAs people warm up again\nthere's increased blood flow\nto the testicles,\nand in women it\nseems there's probably\nincreased blood flow\nto the reproductive organs as\nwell after people warm back up.\nSo that seems to cause some\nsort of hyper nourishment\nof the various cells, the\nSertoli and Leydig cells\nof the testes that\nlead to increased\noutput of testosterone and in\nwomen testosterone as well.\nSo the cold exposure in\nany case is obviously a--\ndo you do the ice bath?\nAre you into that?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I've\nnot done that yet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: As a\nRussian you probably consider\nthat a hot tub.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly.\nYeah.\nIt's a nice thing to have fun\nwith every once in a while\nto warm up.\nNo, I haven't done that.\nBeen kind of waiting\nto maybe do it together\nwith you at some point.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Because\nwe have a guide.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe have one here.\nIt'll be\nstraightforward for you.\nI always say that the\nadrenaline comes in waves,\nand so if you just\nthink about it walls,\nlike you're going through a\nnumber of walls of adrenaline\nas opposed to going for time,\nit becomes rather trivial.\nWith your jujitsu\nbackground and what\nyou'll immediately recognize\nthe physiological sensation.\nEven though it's\ncold specifically,\nit's the adrenaline\nthat makes you\nwant to hop out of the thing.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And\nyou've seen Joe's.\nSo Joe set up a\nreally nice man cave--\nor it's not even a cave\nbecause it's so big.\nIt's like a network\nof man caves.\nBut it has a ice bath and\na sauna next to each other.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one of\nthose here, ice bath and sauna.\nSo we'll have to get you\nin it one of these days.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Sounds\nlike trouble.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe\ntonight, maybe tomorrow.\nNo, although there is a--\nI don't know the underlying\nphysiological basis\nbut there does seem to\nbe a trend toward truth\ntelling in the sauna.\nSome people will refer\nto them as truth barrels.\nMine's a barrel sauna\nshaped like a barrel.\nWho knows why?\nMaybe under intense\nheat duress people just\nfeel compelled to share.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, I have\na complicated relationship\nwith saunas because of\nall the weight cutting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Some of\nthe deepest suffering--\nsorry to interrupt--\nI've done was in the sauna.\nIt's very-- I mean, I've gone\nto some dark places in a sauna\nbecause, I mean, I wrestled\nmy whole life, judo, jujitsu,\nand those weights cuts\ncan really test the mind.\nSo you're-- truth telling.\nYeah, it's a certain\nkind of truth\ntelling because\nyou're sitting there\nand the clock moves slower than\nit has ever moved in your life.\nYeah.\nSo I usually, for\nthe most part, I\nwould try to have a bunch of\nsweats, garbage bags, and all\nthat kind of stuff, and run.\nIt's easier because you\ncan distract the mind.\nIn the sauna you can't\ndistract the mind.\nIt's just and all the excuses\nand all the weaknesses\nin your mind just\ncoming to the surface,\nand you're just sitting there\nand sweating-- or not sweating.\nThat's the worst.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And talk\nabout visual aperture.\nYou're in a small box so it also\ninspires some claustrophobia\neven if you're not\nclaustrophobic.\nThat's absolutely true.\nAnd the desire to just\nget out of the thing\nis where you get a pretty\nserious adrenaline surge\nfrom in the sauna as well.\nNow, the sauna actually will--\nit won't deplete testosterone\nbut it kills sperm.\nSo for people that--\nsperm are on a 60\nday sperm cycle\nso if you're trying\nto donate sperm--\nbecause that's what\ngot us on to this--\nor fertilize an egg or\neggs in whatever format,\ndish or in vivo, as we say\nin science, which means--\nwell, you can look it up, folks.\nThe 60 day sperm cycle.\nSo if you go into\na really hot sauna\nor a hot bath or a\nhot tub, in 60 days\nthose sperm are going to be--\na significantly\ngreater portion of them\nwill be dead, will\nbe non-viable.\nSo there's a simple solution.\nPeople just put ice pack down\nthere or a jar, not this jar,\nbut a jar of cold fluid between\ntheir legs and just sit there,\nor they go back and\nforth between the ice\nbath and the sauna.\nBut you probably-- if you're\ngoing to go back over there\nyou should freeze sperm.\nWe're going to do a couple\nepisodes on fertility when\nit's relatively inexpensive.\nAnd you're young so\nyou probably do it now\nbecause there is a association\nwith autism as males get older.\nIt's not a strong one.\nIt's significant but it's\nstill a small contribution\nto the autism phenotype.\nLEX FRIDMAN: As you age\ndon't sperm get wiser or no?\nThere's no science to back that?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but men\ncan conceive healthy children\nat a considerable age.\nBut in any case--\nbut no, they don't get wiser.\nWhat happens is interesting--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it's a\nlittle bit like the maturation\nof the brain in the sense\nthat some of the sperm\nget much better at swimming\nand then many of them\nget less good.\nMotility is a strong correlate\nof the DNA of the sperm.\nLEX FRIDMAN: This is\nprobably a good time\nto announce that I'm\nselling my sperm as an NFTs.\nI wanted to see how much that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Riding\nthe crypto wave.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, your\nchildren, your future children\nand my future children, are\nsupposed to do jujitsu together\nsince I've only done\nthe one jujitsu class\nso I'm strongly vested\nin you having children.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But only\nin the friendly kind of way.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes.\nFriendly competition\nkind of way.\nYeah.\nDominance of the clan.\nYep.\nFor sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving\non to science, but still\nwith our minds in the Ukraine.\nDid you encounter any scientists\nor see any universities?\nAs we know, in this country\nand in Europe and elsewhere,\nscience takes infrastructure.\nYou need buildings, you need\nlaboratories, you need robots,\nyou need a lot of equipment,\nand you need minus 80 freezers\nand you need incubators\nand you need money\nand you need technicians.\nAnd typically it's been\nthe wealthier countries\nthat have been able to\ndo more research for sake\nof research and development\nand prioritization.\nCertainly the Ukraine had\nsome marvelous universities\nand marvelous scientists.\nWhat's going on with science\nand scientists over there?\nAnd gosh, can we even\ncalculate the loss of discovery\nthat is occurring as a\nconsequence of this conflict?\nLEX FRIDMAN: So science goes on.\nBefore the war Ukraine had\na very vibrant tech sector,\nwhich means engineering\nand all that kind of stuff,\nand Kyiv has a lot of\nexcellent universities\nand they still go on.\nThe biggest hit, I\nwould say, is not\nthe infrastructure\nof the science,\nbut the fact, because\nof the high morale,\neverybody is joining\nthe military.\nSo everybody is\ngoing to the front\nto fight, including you, Andrew\nHuberman, would be fighting,\nand not because you have\nto but because you want to.\nAnd everybody you know\nwould be really proud\nthat you're fighting,\neven though everyone tries\nto convince, Andrew\nHuberman, you\nhave much better\nways to contribute.\nThere's deep honor in fighting\nfor your country, yes,\nbut there are better ways to\ncontribute to your country\nthan just picking up a gun that\nyou're not that trained with\nand going to the front.\nStill, they do it.\nScientists, engineers,\nCEOs, professors, students--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Men and women?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Actors--\nmen and women.\nObviously, primarily\nmen, but men and women.\nMuch more than you would\nsee in other militaries,\nwomen are-- everybody.\nEverybody wants to fight.\nEverybody's proud of fighting.\nThere's no discussion\nof pacifism.\nShould we be fighting?\nIs this right?\nIs this-- everybody's\nreally proud of fighting.\nSo there's this\nkind of black hole\nthat pulls everything,\nall the resources,\ninto the war effort that's\nnot just financial but also\npsychological.\nSo it's like if you're a\nscientist it feels like what--\nit feels almost like\nyou're dishonoring humanity\nby continuing to do things\nyou were doing before.\nThere's a lot of people that\nconverted to being soldiers.\nThey literally watch\na YouTube video\nof how to shoot\na particular gun,\nhow to arm a drone\nwith a grenade.\nIf you're a tech\nperson you know how\nto work with drones so\nyou're going to use that,\nuse whatever skills you got,\nfigure out whatever skills\nyou got and how to use them to\nhelp the effort on the front.\nAnd so that's a big hit.\nBut that said, I've talked\nto a lot of folks in Kyiv--\nfaculty primarily in the\ntech economics space,\nso I didn't get a chance\nto interact with folks who\nare on the biology, chemistry,\nneuroscience side of things,\nbut that still goes on.\nSo one of the really\nimpressive things about Ukraine\nis that they're able to maintain\ninfrastructure like road, food\nsupply, all that kind of stuff,\neducation, while the war is\ngoing on, especially in Kyiv.\nThe war started\nwhere nobody knew\nwhether Kyiv was going to be\ntaken by the Russian forces.\nIt was surrounded.\nAnd a lot of experts from\noutside were convinced that\nRussia would take\nKyiv, and they didn't.\nAnd one of the really\nimpressive things as a leader--\none of the things I\nreally experienced\nis that a lot of people\ncriticized Zelenskyy\nbefore the war.\nHe only had about\n30% approval rate.\nA lot of people\ndidn't like Zelenskyy.\nBut one of the\ngreat things he did\nas a leader, which I'm not\nsure many leaders would\nbe able to do, is when Kyiv\nwas clearly being invaded he\nchose to stay.\nHe stayed in the capital.\nEverybody, all the American\nmilitary, the intelligence\nagencies, NATO, his own staff,\nadvisors all told him to flee,\nand he stayed.\nAnd so I think that was a\nbeacon, a symbol for the rest,\nfor the universities,\nfor science,\nfor the infrastructure\nthat we're staying too,\nand that kept the\nwhole thing going.\nThere's an interesting social\nexperiment that happened,\nI think for folks who\nare interested in gun\ncontrol in this\ncountry in particular,\nis one of the decisions\nthey made early on\nis to give guns to everybody.\nSemi-automatics.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nEarly on in the war?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Early\non in the war, yeah.\nSo everybody got a gun.\nThey also released\na bunch of prisoners\nfrom prison because\nthere was no staff\nto keep the prisons running.\nAnd so there's a\nvery interesting\npsychological experiment of,\nlike, how is this going to go?\nEverybody has a gun.\nAre they going to\nstart robbing places?\nAre they going to\nstart taking advantage\nof a chaotic situation?\nAnd what happened is\nthat crime went to zero.\nSo it turned out that\nthis, as an experiment,\nworked wonderfully.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a\ncase where love generalized.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\nat least hate did not.\nWe don't know if it's\nlove or it's sort of lack\nof initiative for common\nculture directed hate.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nI don't-- right.\nI think that's very correct\nto say that it wasn't\nhate that was unifying people.\nIt was love of country,\nlove of community.\nIt's probably the same thing\nthat will happen to humans when\naliens invade as well.\nIt's the common effort.\nEverybody puts everything\nelse to the side.\nPlus just the sheer amount\nof guns is similar to Texas.\nYou realize, well,\nthere's going to be\na self-correcting mechanism very\nquickly because the rule of law\nwas also put aside, right?\nBasically the police\nforce lost a lot of power\nbecause everybody else\nhas guns and they're\nkind of taking the law\ninto their own hands.\nThat system, at least\nin this particular case\nin this particular moment\nin human history, worked.\nIt's an interesting\nlesson, you know?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It is.\nI had an interesting contrast\nthat I'll share with you\nbecause you mentioned Texas.\nSo not so long ago\nI was in Austin.\nI often visit you or others\nin Austin, as you know.\nAnd many doors that I walked\npast, including a school,\nsaid no firearms\npast this point.\nIt was a sticker on the door.\nYou see this on\nhospitals sometimes.\nI saw this at Baylor College\nof Medicine, et cetera.\nRelatively common\nto see in Texas,\nnot so common in California.\nAnd then I flew to the\nSan Francisco Bay Area,\nwas walking by an elementary\nschool in my old neighborhood,\nand saw a similar\nsticker and looked at it\nand it said, no peanuts\nor other allergy\ncontaining foods past\nthis point on the door\nof this elementary school.\nSo quite a different\ncontrast, guns and peanuts.\nNow, peanut allergies,\nobviously, are very serious\nfor some people, although\nthere's great research out\nof Stanford showing that\nearly exposure to peanuts\ncan prevent the allergies.\nBut don't start rubbing yourself\nin peanut butter, folks,\nif you have a peanut allergy.\nThat's not the best\nway to deal with it.\nIn any case, the\ncontrast of what's\ndangerous, the contrast of\nthe familiarity with guns\nversus no familiarity.\nIn Israel and elsewhere you see\nmachine guns in the airport.\nIn Germany, Frankfurt, you see\nmachine guns in the airport.\nNot so common in\nthe United States.\nSo again, I feel like there's\nthis aperture of vision.\nThere's this aperture of\npleasures versus creature\ncomforts and lack of\ncreature comforts,\nand then there's this\naperture of danger, right?\nPeople who are\nfamiliar with guns\nare familiar with people\ncoming in and setting\ntheir firearm on the table\nand eating dinner, you know?\nBut if you're not accustomed\nto that it's jarring, right?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I should mention--\npeople know this\nthroughout human history--\nbut the human ability\nto get assimilated now,\nget used to violence\nis incredible.\nSo you could be living\nin a peaceful time,\nlike we're here now, and\nthere would be one explosion,\nlike a 9/11 type of situation.\nThat would be a huge shock.\nIt's terrifying.\nEverybody freaks out.\nThe second one is a huge drop\noff in how freaked out you get.\nAnd in a matter of\ndays, sometimes hours,\nit becomes the normal.\nI've talked to so many\npeople in Kharkiv,\nwhich is one of the towns that's\nseen a lot of heated battle.\nYou ask them, is it safe there?\nIn fact, when I went to the--\ncloser and closer to the\nwar zone you ask people,\nis it safe?\nAnd their answer's usually,\nyeah, it's pretty safe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nall signal to noise.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Nobody has told\nme except Western reporters\nsitting in the West\nSide of Ukraine,\nit's really dangerous here.\nEveryone's like,\nyeah, it's good.\nMy uncle just died yesterday.\nHe was shot.\nBut it's pretty good.\nThe farm is still running.\nHow do I put it?\nThey focus on the\npositive, that's one.\nBut there's a\ndeeper truth there,\nwhich is just get used\nto difficult situations\nand the stuff that\nmake you happy\nand the stuff that\nmake you upset\nis relative to that new\nnormal that you establish.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI grew up in California\nand there were a\nlot of earthquakes.\nI remember the '89\nquake, I remember\nthe Embarcadero\nFreeway pancaking\non top of people and cars.\nI remember I moved to\nSouthern California,\nthere was a Northridge quake.\nWherever I move there\nseem to be earthquakes.\nI never worry about\nearthquakes, ever.\nI just don't.\nIn fact, I don't\nlike the destruction\nthey cause, but every once\nin a while an earthquake will\nroll through and it's\nkind of exciting.\nIt sounds like a\ntrain coming through.\nIt's like, wow, like\nthe Earth is moving.\nYou know?\nAgain, I don't want\nanyone to get harmed,\nbut I enjoy a good rumble\ncoming through nonetheless.\nIt's signal to noise.\nBut if I saw a\ntornado I'd freak out,\nand people from the Midwest\nare probably comfortable with--\nDan Gable, the great\nwrestler from the Midwest\nthat you know and I've\nnever met but I have\ngreat respect for, he's\nprobably-- sees a tornado\nand is like, ah, yeah.\nMaybe.\nYeah.\nYou know?\nSo I think signal\nto noise is real.\nBefore I neglect,\nalthough I won't\nforget, speaking of signal\nto noise and environment,\nyou are returning\nto or have gone back\nto one of your original\nnatural habitats,\nwhich is the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology which\nis--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Natural\nhabitat, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's actually\ndifficult to pronounce in full.\nMIT, right?\nSo you've been spending some\ntime there teaching and doing\nother things.\nTell us what you're up\nto with MIT recently.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, I'm\nreally glad that you,\nbeing on the West Coast, know\nthe difference between Boston,\nNew York.\nI feel like a lot of people\nthink it's like the East Coast.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nvery different, especially\nthe Bostonians and New Yorkers.\nLEX FRIDMAN: They\nget very aggressive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I love it.\nI gave lectures there in\nfront of a in person crowd.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nwere you talking about?\nLEX FRIDMAN: For the\nAI, so different aspects\nof AI and robotics, machine\nlearning-- machine learning.\nSo for people who know the\nartificial intelligence field\nthey usually don't\nuse the term AI,\nand people from outside AIs.\nThe biggest breakthroughs\nin the machine\nlearning field with some\ndiscussion of robotics\nand so on.\nYeah.\nIt was in person.\nIt was wonderful.\nI'm a sucker for that.\nI really avoided teaching\nor any kind of interaction\nduring COVID because people\nput a lot of emphasis\non but also got comfortable\nwith remote teaching,\nand I think nobody enjoyed it.\nExcept there's a notion\nthat it's much easier to\ndo because you don't\nhave to travel.\nYou can do it in your\npajamas kind of thing.\nBut when you actually\nget to do it,\nyou don't get the\nsame kind of joy\nthat you do when\nyou're teaching.\nAs a student you don't get the\nsame kind of joy of learning.\nIt's not as effective and\nall that kind of stuff.\nSo to be in person together\nwith people, to see their eyes,\nto get their excitement, to\nget the questions and all\nthe interactions,\nthat was awesome.\nAnd I'm still a sucker and a\nbeliever in the ideal of MIT,\nof the University.\nI think it's an\nincredible place.\nThere's something\nin the air still.\nBut it really hit--\nthe pandemic hit\nuniversities hard because--\nand I can say this.\nThis is not you saying it.\nThis is me saying it.\nThat administrations--\nas in all cases\nwhen people criticize\ninstitutions,\nthe pandemic has given more\npower to the administration\nand taken away power from\nthe faculty and the students,\nand that's from\neverybody involved,\nincluding the administration.\nThat's a concern\nbecause a university\nis about the teachers\nand the students.\nThat should be primary.\nAnd whenever you have\na pandemic there's\nan opportunity to increase\nthe amount of rules.\nOne of the things that\nreally bothered me,\nand I'll scream from\nthe top of the MIT dome,\nabout this is they've instituted\na new temp ticket system.\nWhich is if you're a visitor\nto the campus at MIT,\nyou have to register.\nYou have to, first of all,\nshow that you're vaccinated,\nbut more importantly, there's\na process to visiting.\nYou need to get\npermission to visit.\nOne of the reasons I loved MIT,\nunlike some other institutions,\nMIT just leaves the\ndoor open to anyone.\nIn classrooms you can roll\nin the ridiculous characters.\nThe students that\nare usually doing\nbusiness stuff or economics\ncan roll into a physics class\nand just-- you're\nkind of not allowed\nbut it's a gray area\nso you let that happen,\nand that creates a flourishing\nof a community that\nwas beautiful.\nAnd I think adding extra rules\nputs a squeeze on and limits\nsome of the\nflourishing, and I hope\nsome of that\ndissipates over time\nas we kind of let go of\nthe risk aversion that\nwas created by the pandemic.\nAs we kind of enter\nthe normal return back\nsome of that\nflourishing can happen.\nBut when you're actually\nin there with the students,\nit was magic.\nI love it.\nI love it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, some\nof your earliest videos\non your YouTube channel were\nof you in the classroom, right?\nThat's how this all started.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nYeah.\nThat's how YouTube--\nputting stuff on YouTube\nis terrifying, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, especially\nat the time when you did it.\nAgain, you're a\npioneer in that sense.\nYou did that, Jordan\nPeterson did that.\nPutting up lectures is--\nyeah.\nI teach still.\nEvery winter I teach--\ndirect a course, and I'll\nbe doing even more teaching\ngoing forward.\nBut the idea of those\nvideos being on the web is--\nyeah, that spikes my\ncortisol a little bit.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nIt's terrifying\nbecause you get--\nand everybody has a\ndifferent experience.\nFor me being a junior\nresearch scientist\nthe kind of natural\nconcern is like, who am I?\nAnd when I was giving\nthis lecture it's like,\nI don't deserve any of this.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's your\nhumility coming through,\nand I actually\nthink that humility\non the part of an\ninstructor is good\nbecause those that think that\nthey are entitled, and who else\ncould give this lecture?\nThen I worry more.\nI once heard-- I don't\nknow if it's still\ntrue-- that at Caltech,\nthe great California\nInstitute of Technology\nnot far from here,\nthat many of the\nfaculty are actually\nafraid of the students.\nNot physically\nafraid, but they're\nintellectually afraid because\nthe students are so smart.\nAnd teaching there can\nbe downright frightening,\nI've heard.\nBut that's great.\nKeeps everybody on their toes.\nAnd you know, I've been\ncorrected in lecture\nbefore at Stanford\nand elsewhere.\nWhen my lab was at UC San\nDiego where someone will say,\nhey, wait, last lecture you said\nthis and now you said that--\nor on the podcast.\nYou know?\nAnd I think it's that\nmoment where you sometimes\nfeel that urge to defend and\nyou go, oh, you're right,\nand I think it depends\non how one was trained.\nMy graduate advisor was\nwonderful at saying,\nI don't know, all the time.\nAnd she went to Harvard,\nRadcliffe, UCSF, and Caltech.\nBrilliant woman.\nAnd had no problem\nsaying, I don't know.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I don't\nhave that problem either.\nSo I usually have two guys\nthat somebody speaks up,\ngrab them, drag them out of\nthe room, never see them again.\nSo everybody is\nreally supportive.\nYou don't understand that the\namount of love and support\nI get is--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Especially when\nthe last few students are there\nand everybody seems to be\nnodding as you're going.\nNo, I think that I'd love to\nsit-in on one of your lectures.\nI know very little about AI,\nmachine learning, or robotics.\nBut--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Have you\never talked at MIT?\nHave you ever given lectures?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah.\nWhen I went on the job market\nas a faculty member my final two\nchoices were between\nMIT Picower--\nI had an on-paper offer.\nWonderful place.\nWonderful place to\ndo neuroscience.\nAnd UC San Diego, which is a\nwonderful neuroscience program.\nIn the end it made\nsense for me be\non the West Coast\nfor personal reasons,\nbut there's some amazing\nneuroscience going on there.\nGoodness.\nAnd that's always been true\nand is going to continue.\nIt's been a long time since\nI've been invited back there.\nOddly enough when I started\ndoing more podcasting--\nand I still run a lab but I\nshrunk my lab considerably\nas I've done more podcasting--\nI've received fewer\nacademic lecture\ninvites, which makes sense.\nBut now they're\nsort of coming back.\nAnd so when people\ninvite now I always\nsay, do you want me to talk\nabout the ventral thalamus\nand its role in\nanxiety and aggression\nor do you want me to\ntalk about the podcast?\nAnd my big fear is\nI'm going to go back\nto give a lecture about\nthe retina or something\nand I'll start off with\nan Athletic Greens read\nor something like\nthat just reflexively.\nJust kidding.\nThat wouldn't happen.\nBut listen, I think\nit's great to continue\nto keep a foot in both places.\nI was so happy to\nhear that you're\nteaching at MIT because\npodcasting is one thing,\nteaching is another, and\nthere's overlap there\nin the Venn diagram.\nBut listen, the students\nthat get to sit-in\non one of your\nlectures-- and you\nmay see me sitting\nthere in the audience\nsoon when I creep\ninto your class.\nLEX FRIDMAN: In sunglasses.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right.\nWearing a red shirt.\nYou won't recognize me.\nAre certainly\nreceiving a great gift.\nI've watched your lectures on\nYouTube, even the early ones,\nand listen, I know you to\nbe a phenomenal teacher.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,\nthere's something about--\nso I'm also doing--\nI stayed up pretty\nlate last night\nworking for a\ndeadline on a paper.\nOne of the things\nthat I hope to do\nfor hopefully the rest of my\nlife is to continue publishing,\nand I think it's really\nimportant to do that\neven if you continue the podcast\nbecause you want to be just\non your own intellectual\nand scientific journey\nas you do podcasting.\nAt least for me, and especially\non the engineering side\nbecause I want to\nbuild stuff, and I\nthink that keeps\nyour ego in check,\nkeeps you humble\nbecause I think if you\ntalk too much on a microphone\nyou start getting--\nyou might lose track\nof the grounding that\ncomes from engineering\nand from science\nand the scientific process and\nthe criticisms that you get,\nall that kind of stuff.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And how\nslow and iterative it is.\nWe have two papers right now\nthat are in the revision stage,\nand it's been a very long road.\nAnd I was asked this recently\nbecause I met with my chairman.\nHe said, do you want to\ncontinue to run a lab or are\nyou just going to go\nfull time on the podcast?\nAnd Stanford has been very\nsupportive, I must say,\nas I know MIT has been of you.\nAnd I said, oh,\nI absolutely want\nto continue to be involved\nin research and do research.\nAnd when you start\ntalking about these papers\nand we're looking over my--\nthis was my yearly review\nand looking back\nI'm like, goodness,\nthese papers have been in\nplay for a very long time.\nSo it's a long road but\nyou learn more and more,\nand the more time you\nspend myopically looking\nat a bunch of data the more you\nlearn and the more you think.\nI totally agree.\nTalking to these\ndevices for podcasts\nis wonderful because it's fun.\nIt relieves a certain itch that\nwe both have and hopefully it\nlands some important information\nout there for people,\nbut doing research is the--\nI guess if you know, you know.\nThere's the unpeeling\nof the onion,\nknowing that there could\nbe something there.\nThere's just nothing like it.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I mean, you do--\nespecially with the pandemic.\nAnd for me, both\nTwitter and the podcast\nhave made me much more\nimpatient about the slowness\nof the review process because--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nTwitter will do that.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will.\nBut even with podcast\nyou have a cool--\nyou'll find something cool\nand then you have ideas\nand you'll just say them and\nthey'll be out pretty quickly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Then we do a\npost right now about something\nthat we both found interesting\nand it's out in the world.\nYep.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And\nyou can write up\nsomething, like there\nis a culture in computer\nscience of posting stuff\non arXiv and preprints\nthat don't get annual review,\nand sometimes they don't even\ngo through the review process\never because people just\nstart using them if it's code.\nAnd it's like, what's\nthe point of this?\nIt works.\nIt's self evident that it works\nbecause people are using it,\nand that I think applies\nmore to engineering fields\nbecause it's an actual\ntool that works.\nIt doesn't matter if-- you don't\nhave to scientifically prove\nthat it works.\nIt works because it's\nusing for a lot of people.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry\nto interrupt, but I just--\nfor point of reference,\nthe famous paper\ndescribing the\ndouble helix which\nearned Watson and\nCrick the Nobel Prize\nand should have earned Rosalind\nFranklin Nobel Prize too,\nof course, but they got it for\nthe structure of DNA of course.\nThat paper was never\nreviewed at Nature.\nThey published it because its\nimportance was self evident,\nor whatever.\nThey decided--\nLEX FRIDMAN: So the editors.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It was that\npurely editorial decision,\nI believe.\nI mean, that's what I\nwas told by someone who's\ncurrently an editor at Nature.\nIf that turns out\nto not be correct\nsomeone will tell us in\nthe comments for sure.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, I think--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\npretty interesting, right?\nLEX FRIDMAN: That's\nreally interested.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps the\nmost significant discovery\nin biology and\nbioengineering which\nwas leading to\nbioengineering as well,\nof course, of the last\ncentury was not peer reviewed.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but--\nso Eric Weinstein,\nbut many others\nhave talked about\nthis, which is, I mean,\nI don't think people understand\nhow poor the peer review\nprocess is.\nJust the amount of--\nbecause you think peer\nreview it means all the\nbest peers get together\nand they review your\nstuff, but it's unpaid work\nand it's usually a\nsmall number of people.\nAnd they have a very\nselect perspective\nso they might not be the\nbest person, especially\nif it's super novel work.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's\nwho has time to do it.\nI'm on a bunch of\neditorial boards still.\nWhy, I don't know, but I\nenjoy the peer review process\nand sending papers out.\nOftentimes the best\nscientists are very busy\nand don't have time to review.\nAnd oftentimes the\nmore premiere journals\nwill select from a kind\nof a unique kit of very\ngood scientists who are\nvery close to the work,\nsometimes the people are\nvery far from the work.\nIt really depends.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And both\nhave negatives, right?\nIf you're very close\nto the work there's\njealousy, and all those\nbasic human things.\nVery far from the\nwork you might not\nappreciate the\nnuanced contribution,\nall that kind of stuff.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthere's psychology.\nSorry to interrupt again, but\na good friend of mine who's\nextremely successful\nneuroscientist,\nHoward Hughes\ninvestigator, et cetera,\nalways told me that they--\nI won't even say whether\nor not who they are.\nThey select their\nreviewers on the basis\nof who has been publishing\nvery well recently because they\nassume that that\nperson is going to be\nmore benevolent because\nthey have been doing\nwell so that the love expands.\nLEX FRIDMAN: That's a good\npoint to that, actually.\nBut the idea is that\neditors might actually\nbe the best reviewers, so that\nwas the traditional-- that's\nthe thing I wanted to mention\nthat Eric Weinstein talks\nabout, that back several\ndecades ago editors had\nmuch more power.\nAnd there is something to be\nmade for that because editors\nare the ones who are responsible\nfor crafting the journal.\nThey really are\ninvested in this,\nand they're also\noften experts, right?\nIt makes sense for\nan editor to have\na bit of power in this case.\nUsually if an idea is truly\nnovel you could see it,\nAnd so it makes\nsense for an editor\nto have more power\nin that regard.\nOf course for me,\nI think peer review\nshould be done the\nway tweets are done,\nwhich is crowdsourced\nor Amazon reviews.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Let\nthe crowd decide.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Let\nthe crowd decide,\nand let the crowd add depth\nand breadth and context\nfor the contribution.\nSo if the paper overstates\nthe degree of contribution,\nthe crowd will\ncheck you on that.\nIf there's not enough support\nor the conclusions are not\nsupported by the evidence, the\ncrowd will check you on that.\nThere could be, of course,\npolitical bickering\nthat enters the\npicture, especially\non very controversial\ntopics, but I\nthink I trust the\nintelligence of human beings\nto figure that out.\nAnd I think most of us\nare trying to figure\nthis whole process out.\nI just wish it was\nhappening much faster\nbecause on the important\ntopics, the review\ncycle could be faster.\nAnd we learned\nthat through COVID\nthat Twitter was\nactually pretty effective\nat doing science communication.\nIt was really interesting.\nSome of the best\nscientists took to Twitter\nto communicate their own\nwork and other people's work,\nand always putting\ninto the caveats\nthat it's not peer reviewed and\nso on, but it's all out there\nand the data just moves so fast.\nAnd if you want\nstuff to move fast,\nTwitter is the best medium\nof communication for that.\nIt's cool to see.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand thank our sponsor,\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a\nlot of blood and DNA\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get data\nback about metabolic\nfactors, lipids, and hormones\nand so forth, but you don't\nknow what to do with those data.\nInsideTracker\nsolves that problem\nand makes it very easy\nfor you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation\nbased interventions\nyou might want to\ntake on in order\nto adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors, hormones,\nlipids, and other\nthings that impact\nyour immediate and long\nterm health to bring\nthose numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate\nand, indeed, optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to try\nInsideTracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman to\nget $200 off an ultimate plan\nor 34% off the entire site as\na special Black Friday deal now\nthrough the end of November.\nAgain, that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman,\nand use the code\nHuberman at checkout.\nI'm now on Twitter\nmore regularly,\nand initially it\nwas just Instagram.\nAnd I remember you and I used to\nhave these over dinner or drink\nconversations where I'd say,\nI don't understand Twitter.\nAnd you'd say, I don't\nunderstand Instagram.\nAnd of course, we\nunderstand how it worked\nand how to work each\nrespective platform,\nbut I think we were both\ntrying to figure out\nwhat is driving the psychology\nof these different venues\nbecause they are quite distinct\npsychologies for whatever\nreason.\nI think I'm finally starting\nto understand Twitter and enjoy\nit a little bit.\nInitially I wasn't\nprepared for the level\nof reflexive scrutiny.\nIt sounds a little\nbit oxymoronic,\nbut that people pick\nup on one small thing\nand then drive it\ndown that trajectory.\nIt didn't seem to be happening\nquite as much on Instagram,\nbut I love your tweets.\nI do have a question\nabout your Twitter account\nand how you-- do you have sort\nof internal filters of what\nyou'll put up and won't put up?\nBecause sometimes you'll\nput up things that\nare about life and reflections.\nOther times you'll put up\nthings like what you're\nexcited about in\nAI, or of course,\npoint to various podcasts\nincluding your own,\nbut others as well.\nHow do you approach\nsocial media?\nNot in how do you\nregulate your behavior\non there in terms of how\nmuch time, et cetera.\nI know you've talked\nabout that before.\nBut you know, what's your\nmindset around social media\nwhen you go on there to either\npost or forage or respond\nto information?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I think\nI try to add some--\nnot the sound cliche, but some\nlove out there into the world\ninto, as OJ Simpson\ncalls it, Twitter world.\nI think there is this viral\nnegativity that can take hold,\nand I try to find the right\nlanguage to add good vibes out\nthere.\nAnd it's actually\nreally, really tricky\nbecause there's something about\npositivity that sounds fake.\nI can't quite put\nmy finger on it,\nbut whenever I talk about\nlove and positive and almost\nchildlike in my curiosity\nand positivity, people\nstart to think, surely he\nhas skeletons in the closet.\nThere's dead bodies\nin his basement.\nThis must be a fake--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNo, it's the attic.\nLEX FRIDMAN: It's the attic?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The attic.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I keep\nmine in the basement.\nThat's the details.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I was\nreferring to your attic.\nI don't have an attic or a\nbasement, nor dead bodies.\nI just want to be very clear.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nI do have an attic and actually\nI haven't been up there.\nMaybe there is bodies up there.\nBut yes, I prefer the basement.\nIt's colder down there.\nI like it.\nNo, but there's an assumption\nthat this is not genuine\nor it's disingenuous\nin some kind of way.\nAnd so I try to find the\nright language for that kind\nof stuff, how to be positive.\nSome of it I was really inspired\nby Elon's approach to Twitter.\nNot all of it, but\nwhen he just is silly.\nI found that silliness--\nI think it's Hermann Hesse\nsaid something to paraphrase--\none of my favorite writers--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I\nthink in Steppenwolf\nsaid, learn what is\nto be taken seriously\nand laugh at the rest.\nI think I try to be\nsilly, laugh at myself,\nlaugh at the absurdity\nof life, and then in part\nwhen I'm serious, try to\njust be positive, just\nto see a positive perspective.\nAnd also, as you said,\npeople pick out certain words\nand so on and they\nattack each other,\nattack me over certain usage\nof words in a particular tweet.\nI think the thing I try to do is\nthink positively towards them,\nlike do not escalate.\nSo whenever somebody's\ncriticizing me and so on,\nI just smile.\nIf there's a lesson to\nbe learned, I learn it\nand then I just send\ngood vibes their way.\nDon't respond, and\njust hopefully,\nthrough karma and through the\nripple effect of positivity,\nhave an impact on them and\nthe rest of the Twitter.\nAnd what you find\nis that builds--\nyour actions create\nthe community.\nSo how I behave gets me\nsurrounded by certain people.\nBut lately, especially Ukraine\nis one topic like this,\nI also thought\nabout talking to--\nsomebody who reached out\nto me is Andrew Tate,\nwho's extremely controversial.\nFrom the perspective of a lot\nof people is a misogynist.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI've heard his name\nand I know that there's a lot\nof controversy around him.\nMaybe you could familiarize me.\nI've been pretty nose\ndown in podcast prep\nand I tried to do this\nvacation thing for about three,\nfour weeks.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I've\nheard about that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nAnd it sort of worked.\nI did get some time in\nthe Colorado wilderness\nby myself, which was great.\nI did get some downtime.\nBut in any event, it mainly\nconsisted of reading and--\nLEX FRIDMAN: And nature?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading\nand nature, sauna, ice bath,\nworking out, good food,\na little extra sleep,\nthese kinds of things I\nreally felt I needed it.\nBut I am pretty\nnaive when it comes\nto the kind of\ncurrent controversies\nbut I've heard his\nname, and I think\nhe's been deplatformed\non a couple of platforms.\nDo I have that right?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's\nbeen-- so I should also\nadmit that while I might\nknow more than you,\nit's not by much.\nSo it's like a\nfive-year-old talking\nto a four-year-old right now.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he\nan athlete, a podcaster?\nLEX FRIDMAN: So basic summary,\nhe used to be a fighter,\na kickboxer, I believe.\nWas pretty successful.\nAnd then during\nthat and after that\nI think he was on\na reality show,\nand he had all these programs\nthat are basically pickup\nartist advice.\nHe has this community of\npeople where he gives advice\non how to pick up women, how to\nbe successful in relationships,\nhow to make a lot of\nmoney, and it costs money\nto enter those programs.\nSo a lot of the criticism\nthat he gets is kind of--\nit's like a pyramid scheme\nwhere you convince people\nto join so that they\ncan make more money\nand then they convince others\nto join, and that kind of stuff.\nBut that's not why I'm\ninterested in talking to him.\nI'm interested because\none of the guests--\nmaybe I should mention who, but\none of the female guests I had,\nreally a big scientist, said\nthat her two kids that are 13\nand 12 really look up\nto Andrew to entertain--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it male\nchildren, female children?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Male.\nAnd I hear this\ntime and time again.\nSo he is somebody that a lot of\nteens, young teens, look up to.\nSo I haven't done\nserious research.\nI usually try to avoid doing\nresearch until I agree to talk\nand then I go deep.\nBut there is an\naspect to the way\nhe talks about women that, while\nI understand and I understand\ncertain dynamics in\nrelationships work for people\nand he's one such\nperson, but I think\nhim being really disrespectful\ntowards women is not what I--\nit's not how I see what\nit means to be a good man.\nSo the conversation I\nwant to have with him\nis about masculinity.\nWhat does masculinity\nmean in the 21st century?\nAnd so when I think\nabout that kind of stuff,\nand because we're\ntalking about Twitter,\nit's like going into a war zone.\nI'm a happy go\nlucky person, but--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\nlike, send me to Ukraine,\nbut I don't want to have\nthis conversation on Twitter.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Because\nit's a really, really,\nreally tricky one because\nalso, as you know,\nwhen you do a podcast,\neverybody wants you to win.\nIt's everything\nyou do is positive.\nMaybe you'll say the wrong\nthing as inaccurate thing\nand you can correct yourself.\nWith Andrew Tate, with Donald\nTrump, with folks like this,\nyou have to--\nI mean, it's a\nprofessional boxing.\nI think you have\nto push the person.\nYou have to be really eloquent.\nYou have to be also empathetic\nbecause you can't just\ndo what journalists\ndo, which is talk down\nto the person the entire time.\nThat's easy.\nThe hard thing is to\nempathize with the person,\nto understand them, to\nsteel man their case,\nbut also to make your own case.\nSo in that case about what\nit means to be a man, to me\na strong man is somebody\nwho is respectful to women.\nNot out of weakness, not out\nof social justice warrior\nsignaling, and all that kind\nof stuff, but out of that's\nwhat a strong man does.\nThey don't need to be\ndisrespectful to prove\ntheir position in life.\nHe is often-- now, a lot of\npeople say it's a character.\nHe's being misogynistic.\nHe's being a misogynist as a\nkind of-- for entertainment\npurposes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo like an avatar.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nBut to me, that avatar has a\nlot of influence on young folks\nso the character has impact.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOh, I don't think\nyou can separate the\navatar and the person\nin terms of the\nimpact, as you said.\nIn fact, there are\na number of accounts\non Twitter and Instagram and\nelsewhere which people have\nonly revealed their first\nnames or they give themself\nanother name or they're\nusing a cartoon image.\nAnd part of that, I\nbelieve, in at least\nfrom some of these individuals\nwho actually know who they are,\nI understand as an attempt to\nmaintain their privacy, which\nis important to many people.\nAnd in some cases so that\nthey can be more inflammatory\nand then just pop up\nelsewhere as something\nelse without anyone knowing\nthat it's the same person.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Some of--\nthis is the dark stuff.\nI've been reading a lot about\nUkraine and Nazi Germany,\nso the '30s and\nthe '40s and so on,\nand you get to see how\nmuch the absurdity turns\nto evil quickly.\nOne of the things I worry--\none of the things\nI really don't like\nto see on Twitter\nand the internet\nis how many statements\nend with LOL.\nIt's like you think just because\nsomething is kind of funny\nor is funny or is\nlegitimately funny,\nit also doesn't have a\ndeep effect on society.\nSo that's such a\ndifficult gray area\nbecause some of the best\ncomedy is dark and mean,\nbut it reveals some important\ntruth that we need to consider.\nBut sometimes comedy\nis just covering up\nfor destructive\nideology, and you\nhave to know the line\nbetween those two.\nHitler was seen as a joke in\nthe late '20s and the '30s\nin Nazi Germany until the\njoke became very serious.\nYou have to be careful\nto know the difference\nbetween the joke and the\nreality and do all that.\nI mean, in a conversation--\nI'm just such a big\nbeliever in conversation\nto be able to reveal something\nthrough conversation,\nbut I don't know.\nOne of the big--\nyou and I challenge\nourselves all the time.\nI don't know if I\nhave what it takes\nto have a good, empathetic,\nbut adversarial conversation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I need to learn\nmore about this Tate person,\nor not learn about them.\nYeah.\nIt sounds like maybe\nit's something to skip.\nI don't know because, again, I'm\nnot familiar with the content.\nBut I was going to\nask you whether or not\nyou've seeked out\nor whether or not\nyou would ever consider\nhaving Donald Trump as a guest\non your podcast.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I've\ntalked to Joe a lot about this\nand I really believe I can have\na good conversation with Donald\nTrump, but I haven't seen many\ngood conversations with him.\nSo part of me thinks--\npart of me believes\nit's possible,\nbut he often effectively\nruns over the interviewer.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You could\nsit him down, give him\nan element in Athletic Greens.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat nice, cool, air\nconditioned black\ncurtain studio you've got\nand a different\nside might come out.\nContext is powerful.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's\nreally good at this,\nwhich is relaxing the person.\nLike here, have a drink.\nSmoke a joint, or\nwhatever it is.\nBut this energy of\njust, let's relax,\nand there's laughter and so on.\nI don't think-- as\npeople know, I'm just\nnot good at that kind of stuff.\nSo I think the way I could have\na good conversation with him\nis to really understand\nhis worldview,\nbe able to steel\nman his worldview\nand those that support him.\nWhich is, I'm sorry\nto say for people\nwho seem to hate Donald Trump,\nis a very large percentage\nof the country.\nAnd so you have to really\nempathize with those people.\nYou have to empathize with\nDonald Trump, the human being,\nand from that perspective,\nask him hard questions.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo who do you think\nis the counterpoint\nif you're going\nto seek balance in your guests.\nIf you're going\nto have Trump on,\nthen you have to have who on?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well,\nthat's interesting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnthony Fauci seems\nto be strongly associated\nwith counter values, at least\nin the eye of the public.\nI think he's retiring soon, but.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,\nhe's retiring.\nSo that's really\ninteresting, Anthony Fauci.\nYeah, definitely, but I don't\nthink he's a counterbalance.\nHe's a complicated,\nfascinating figure\nwho seems to have attracted\na lot of hate and distrust,\nbut also--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nlove from some people.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And love.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nlove from some people.\nI mean, I know people, not\neven necessarily scientists,\nwho have pro-Fauci shirts.\nI've seen people with anti-Fauci\nshirts, excuse me, certainly,\nbut who adore him.\nThere are people who adore\nhim in the same way there\nare people that adore Trump.\nIt's so interesting that\none species of animal\nyou get such divergent\nneural circuitry.\nLEX FRIDMAN: It\nalmost feels like it's\nby design and every single topic\nwe find tension and division is\nfascinating to watch.\nI mean, I got to really witness\nit from zero to a hundred\nin Ukraine, where there is\nnot huge significant division.\nThere was in certain parts of\nUkraine, but across Europe,\nacross the world there\nwas not that much division\nbetween Russia and Ukraine,\nand it was just born\novernight, this intense hatred.\nYou see the same kind of stuff\nwith Fauci over the pandemic.\nAt first we were all\nhuddled in uncertainty.\nThere is a togetherness\nwith the pandemic.\nOf course, there\nis more difficult\nbecause you're isolated.\nBut then you start\nto figure out--\nprobably the politicians and\nthe media try to figure out,\nhow can I take a side\nhere and how can I\nnow start reporting on\nthis side or that side\nand say how the\nother side is wrong?\nAnd so I think Anthony Fauci\nis a part of just being used\nas a scapegoat\nfor certain things\nas part of that kind of\nnarrative of division.\nBut I think-- so Trump is\na singular figure that,\nto me, represents something\nimportant in American history.\nI'm not sure what\nthat is, but I think\nyou have to think-- you\nput on your historian hat,\ngo forward in time,\nand think back.\nHow will he be remembered 20,\n30, 40, 50 years from now?\nWho is the opposite of that?\nYou have to--\nI would really have\nto think about that\nbecause Trump was so singular.\nI think AOC is an\ninteresting one,\nbut she's so young it's\nunclear to know how--\nif she represents a legitimately\nlarge scale movement or not.\nBernie Sanders is an\ninteresting option,\nbut I wish he would be\n30, 40 years younger.\nThe young Bernie\nwould be a good--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: There are\nscientists working on that.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think so.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not\nhim specifically, but--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah.\nMaybe him.\nWe never know.\nThere is a big conspiracy\ntheory that Putin is--\nthat that's a body double.\nIt's no longer him.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBernie is Putin?\nLEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm having a\nhard time merging that image.\nLEX FRIDMAN: The conspiracy\ntheory is-- no, no, no.\nThat the Putin we see on\ncamera today is a body double.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\none thing that in science,\nand in particular,\nin anatomy, there's\na classification scheme for\ndifferent types of anatomists,\nwhich they either say you're\na lumper or a splitter.\nSome people like to call a\nwhole structure something,\nnot necessarily\njust for simplicity\nbut for a lot of reasons.\nAnd then other people like\nto microdivide the nucleus\ninto multiple names.\nAnd of course, people used to\nbe able to name different brain\nstructures after themselves.\nSo that would be the nucleus of\nLex and the Huberman vesiculus\nor whatever.\nLess of that nowadays.\nAnd by the way, those structures\ndon't actually exist just yet.\nWe haven't defined those yet.\nI was making those names up.\nBut what's interesting is it\nseems like in the last five\nyears, there's been\na lot of trend--\nthere's been a trend, excuse\nme, toward a requirement\nfor lumping.\nYou can't say-- it seems that\nit's not allowed, if you will,\nto say, hey, yeah, you know--\nand here I'm not stating my--\nI will never reveal\nmy preferences\nabout pandemic related things\nfor hopefully obvious reasons.\nSome people will say\nvaccines, yes, but masks, no.\nOr vaccines and masks,\nyes, but let people work.\nAnd other people will say,\nno, everyone stay home.\nAnd then other people will\nsay, no, no vaccines, no masks.\nLet everybody work.\nNo one was saying no vaccines,\nno masks, and stay home,\nI don't think.\nSo there's this sort\nof lumping, right?\nThe boundaries around\nideology really\ndid start to defy science.\nI mean, it wasn't scientific.\nIt was one part science-ish\nat times and sometimes\nreally hardcore science.\nOther times it was\npolitics, economics.\nI mean, we really\nsaw the confluence\nof all these different\ndomains of society\nthat use very different\ncriteria to evaluate the world.\nI mean, as a\nscientist, I remember\nwhen the vaccines\nfirst came out and I\nasked somebody, one\nof the early concerns\nI had that was actually\nsatisfied for me was,\nhow does this thing turn off?\nIf you start generating\nmRNA, how does it actually\nget turned off?\nSo I asked a friend, they\nknow a lot about RNA biology.\nAnd I said, you know,\nhow does it turn off?\nThey explained it to me and\nI was like, OK, makes sense.\nI asked some other questions.\nBut most people aren't\ngoing to think about it\nat that level of\ndetail necessarily,\nbut it did seem\nthat there was just\nkind of amorphous\nblobs of ideology\nthat they grabbed on\nto things and then\nthere was this need for\na chasm between them.\nIt was almost felt like it\nbecame illegal, in some ways,\nto want two of the things from\nthat menu and one of the things\nfrom that menu.\nI really felt like I\nwas being constrained\nby a kind of like\nBento box model\nwhere I didn't get to define\nwhat was in the Bento box.\nI could either have Bento\nbox A or Bento box Z,\nbut nothing in between.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And I\nthink on that topic\nand I think a lot of\ntopics, most people\nare in the middle with\nhumility, uncertainty,\nand they're just kind of\ntrying to figure it out.\nAnd I think there is just\nthe extremes defining\nthe nature of this division.\nSo I think it's the\nrole of a lot of us\nin our individual\nlives, and also\nif you have a\nplatform of any kind,\nI think you have to try to walk\nin the middle with the empathy\nand humility.\nAnd that's actually what science\nis about is the humility.\nI'm still thinking about\nwho's the opposite of Trump.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nmaybe there is none.\nI mean, maybe Fauci is\northogonal to Trump.\nI mean, not everything\nhas an opposite.\nI mean, maybe he's\nan n of 1 maybe\nhe's in the minority\nof one because he\nwas an outsider from Washington\nwho then made it there.\nLEX FRIDMAN: But also I wonder--\nyou have to pick your battles\nbecause every battle you fight\nyou should take very seriously.\nAnd just the amount\nof hate I get,\nI got, and I still get\nfor having sat down\nwith the Pfizer CEO, that was\na very valuable lesson for me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that\none got you a lot of heat?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it\nstill does because--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you\nhad some pretty controversial\nguests on from time to time.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that one--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he\nstill the Pfizer CEO?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I believe so.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs\nturn over like crazy.\nThis is the thing\nI didn't realize.\nIn science if somebody moves\ninstitutions it's a big deal.\nMost people don't have more\nthan two moves in their career,\nmaybe.\nBut they often move to the\nnext building is a big deal.\nBut it in biotech--\nit's like have a former\ncolleague of mine\nfrom San Diego and\nhe's been a CEO here,\nthen he's a CEO there.\nHe went back to a company\nhe was a CEO before.\nHe's probably back\nat the university\nwe worked at for all I know.\nIt's amazing how much\nmoving around there.\nIt is a very\nitinerant profession.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,\nI think they're--\nin certain companies, I guess\nin biotech would be the case,\nthe CEO is more of like a\nmanager type so you can--\njumping around benefits\nyour experience\nso you become better and\nbetter being a manager.\nThere's some leader\nrevolutionary CEOs\nthat stick around for\nlonger because they're\nso critical to\npivoting a company,\nlike the Microsoft\nCEO currently.\nSundar Pichai is\nsomebody like that.\nObviously, Elon Musk is\nsomebody like that that\nis part of pivoting a company\ninto new domains constantly,\nbut yeah.\nIn biotech there's a machine.\nIn the eyes of a lot of people,\nbig pharma is like big tobacco.\nIt's the epitome of everything\nthat is wrong with capitalism.\nIt's evil, right?\nAnd so I showed up\nin the conversation\nwhere I thought with\na pretty open mind\nand really asked what I\nthought were difficult\nquestions of him.\nI don't think he's ever sat\ndown to a grilling of that kind.\nIn fact, I'm pretty sure\nthey cut the interview short\nbecause of that, and\nI thought literally it\nwas hot in the room\nand we're sweating\nand I was asking\ntough questions.\nFor somebody that half the\ncountry or a large percent\nof the country believes he's\nalleviated a lot of-- he\nhelped, through the financial\nresources that Pfizer has,\nhelped alleviate a lot of\nsuffering in the world.\nAnd so I thought for\nsomebody like that,\nI was asking pretty\nhard questions.\nBoy, did I get to\nhear from the side--\nusually one of the sides is\nmore intense in their anger.\nSo there are certain\npolitical topics--\nlike with Andrew\nTate, for example,\nI would hear from a very--\nit would probably be\nthe left, far left,\nthat would write very angrily.\nAnd so that's a group\nyou'll hear from.\nThe Pfizer CEO, I didn't\nget almost any messages\nfrom people saying, why\ndid you go so hard on him?\nHe's an incredible human,\nincredible leader and CEO\nof a company that helped\nus with the vaccine\nthat nobody thought would be\npossible to develop so quickly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You did not\nget letters of that sort?\nLEX FRIDMAN: I did not.\nI mean, here and there,\nbut the sea of people\nthat said everything\nfrom me being\nweak that I wasn't able\nto call out this person,\nhow do you sit down, how do\nyou platform this evil person,\nhow do you make him look\nhuman, all that kind of stuff.\nAnd you have to deal with that.\nYou have to-- of\ncourse, it's great.\nIt's great because I have to\ndo some soul searching, which\nis like, did I?\nYou have to ask\nsome hard questions.\nI love criticism like that.\nYou get to--\nI had some low points.\nThere's definitely some despair\nand you start to wonder,\nwas I too weak?\nShould I have talked to him?\nWhat is true?\nAnd you sit there alone\nand just marinate in that.\nHopefully over time\nthat makes you better,\nbut I still don't know what the\nright answer with that one is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel\nthat money plays a role here.\nWhen people think\nbig pharma, they\nthink billions of dollars--\nmaybe even trillions\nof dollars, really.\nAnd certainly people who make a\nlot of money get scrutiny that\nothers don't.\nPart of it is that they are\noften not always visible,\nbut I think that there is\na natural and reflexive--\nand I'm not justifying it.\nI certainly don't\nfeel this because I\nknow some people who\nare very wealthy,\nsome people who are very poor.\nI can't say it scales\nwith happiness at all.\nPeople are always\nshocked to hear that,\nbut that's what I've observed\nin very wealthy people.\nBut that people who\nhave a lot of money\nare often held to a\ndifferent standard\nbecause people resent\nthat, some people resent\nthat, and maybe there are\nother reasons as well.\nI mean, among people\nwho are very wealthy,\noftentimes the wish\nis for status, right?\nNot money.\nYou get a bunch of\nbillionaires in a room,\nand unless one of\nthem is Elon, who\nalso has immense status\nfor his accomplishments,\ntypically if you put a\nNobel Prize winner in a room\nwith a bunch of\nbillionaires they're\nall talking to that person.\nRight?\nAnd there are many very\ninteresting billionaires.\nBut status is something that is\noften but not always associated\nwith money, but is a much\nrarer form of uniqueness\nout there, a\npositive uniqueness--\nif one considers status positive\nbecause there's a downside to.\nSo I wonder whether or not the\nPfizer CEO caught extra heat\nbecause people\nassume, and I probably\nassume also, that his\nsalary is quite immense.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nSo because I have a\nlot of data on this.\nI can answer it.\nIt's a very good hypothesis.\nLet's test that scientifically.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's about to\ntell me it's a great hypothesis\nbut it's wrong.\nI know the smirk.\nI know the smirk.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I honestly\nthink it's wrong.\nThat effect is there\nfor a lot of people,\nbut I think the distrust\nis not towards the CEO.\nThe distrust is\ntowards the company.\nOne of the really\ndifficult soul searching I\nhad to do, which is just having\nto interact with Pfizer folks\nat every level, from\njunior to the CEO,\nthey're all really nice people.\nThey have a mission.\nThey talk about trying\nto really help people\nbecause that's the\nbest way to make\nmoney is to come\nup with medicine\nthat helps a lot of people.\nThe mission is clear.\nThey're all good people, a lot\nof really brilliant people,\nPhDs.\nSo you can have a system\nwhere all the people are good,\nincluding the CEO.\nAnd by good, I mean\npeople that really\nare trying to do everything.\nThey dedicate their\nwhole life to do good.\nAnd yet, you have to think\nthat that system can deviate\nfrom a path that does good\nbecause you start to deceive\nyourself of what is good,\nyou turn it into a game\nwhere money does come into\nplay from a company perspective\nwhere you convince yourself\nthe more money you make,\nthe more good you'll\nbe able to do.\nAnd then you start to focus\nmore and more and more\non making more money, and then\nyou can really deviate and lose\ntrack of what is actually good.\nI'm not saying necessarily\nPfizer does that,\nbut I think companies\ncould do that.\nYou can apply that criticism\nto social media companies,\nto big pharma companies.\nOne of the big lessons for me--\nI don't know what the answer\nis, but that all the people\ninside the company\ncan be good, people\nyou would want to\nhang out with, people\nyou would want to work with,\nbut as a company is doing evil.\nThat's a possibility.\nSo the distrust I don't think\nis towards the billionaire\nindividual, which I do\nsee a lot of in this case.\nI think it's Wall\nStreet distrust,\nthat the machinery of this\nparticular organization\nhas gone off track.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the\ngeneralization of hate again.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nAnd then good luck\nfiguring out what is true.\nThis is the tough stuff.\nBut I should say\nthe individuals--\nindividual scientists\nat the NIH and Pfizer\nare just incredible people.\nThey're really brilliant people.\nI never trust the administration\nor the business people--\nno offense, business people.\nBut the scientists\nare always good.\nThey have the right\nmotivator in life.\nBut again, they can\nhave blinders on.\nToo focused on the science.\nNazi Germany has a\nhistory of people\njust too focused on\nthe science and then\nthe politicians use the\nscientists to achieve\nwhatever end they want.\nBut if you just look narrowly\nat the journey of a scientist,\nit's a beautiful one\nbecause they're ultimately\nin it for the\ncuriosity, the moment\nof discovery versus money.\nI mean, prestige probably does\ncome into play later in life,\nbut especially young scientists.\nThey're after the--\nit's like they're\npulling at the\nthreat of curiosity\nto try to discover\nsomething big.\nThey get excited by\nthat kind of stuff,\nand it's beautiful to see.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nis beautiful see.\nI have a former\ngraduate student,\nnow a postdoc at\nCaltech, and I don't even\nknow she had a cell phone.\nShe would come in the lab, put\nher cell phone into the desk,\nand she was\ntremendously productive.\nBut that wasn't why\nI brought it up.\nShe was productive as a side\neffect of just being absolutely\ncommitted and\nobsessed to discover\nthe answers to the\nquestions she was\nasking as best she could, and\nit was-- you could feel it.\nYou could just feel the\nintensity, and just incredibly\nlow activation energy.\nIf there was an experiment to\ndo she would just go do it.\nYou're teaching at MIT.\nYou are obviously\ntraveling the world,\nyou're right on the podcast\na lot of coverage of chess\nrecently, which is interesting.\nI don't play chess but--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Oh, I have\nsome scientific questions\nto you about that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK.\nSure.\nLet's get to those for sure.\nAnd then--\nLEX FRIDMAN: You're\nnot going to like it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.\nOK.\nAnd then also some very--\ndo I have to spell\nMassachusetts again?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Of course.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAlso you still seem\nto have a proclivity for finding\nguests that are controversial,\nright?\nYou're thinking about Tate,\nwe're talking about Trump,\nwe're talking about the Pfizer\nCEO, we're talking about Fauci.\nThese are intense people.\nAnd so what we're\ngetting folks is a--\nwe're not doing\nneuroimaging here\nin the traditional sense of\nputting someone into a scanner.\nWhat we're doing\nhere is we're using,\nas the great Karl Deisseroth,\nwho was on your podcast--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Thank you for that.\nThank you for connecting us.\nHe's an incredible person.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's an\nincredible psychiatrist,\nbioengineer, and human\nbeing and writer,\nand your conversation\nwith him was phenomenal.\nI listened to it twice.\nI actually have taken notes.\nWe talk about it\nin this household.\nWe really do.\nHis description of\nlove is not to be\nmissed, I'll just\nleave it at that,\nbecause if I try and say\nit I won't capture it well.\nBut we're getting\na language based\nmap of at least a portion\nof Lex Fridman's brain here.\nSo what else is going on\nthese days in that brain\nas it relates to robotics, AI?\nOur last conversation\nwas a lot about robots\nand the potential for\nrobot-human interaction.\nEven what is a robot, et cetera.\nAre you still working on robots\nor focused on robots, and where\nis science showing up in your\nlife besides the things we've\nalready talked about?\nLEX FRIDMAN: So I\nthink the last time\nwe talked was before Ukraine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.\nYou were just about to leave.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nI mean--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthat's why I went on.\nI was like, you\nknow, this might be\nthe last-- you said you\nwanted to come out here\nbefore or after.\nI was like, come\nout there before.\nI want to see you before you go.\nBut here you are in the flesh.\nLEX FRIDMAN: So a lot of--\njust a lot of my mind has\nbeen occupied, obviously,\nwith that part of the world.\nBut most of the\ndifficult struggles\nthat I'm still going through\nis that I haven't launched\nthe company that\nI want to launch\nand the company\nhas to do with AI.\nI mean, it's maybe a\nlonger conversation,\nbut the ultimate dream is\nto put robots in every home.\nBut short term I see\nthere a possibility\nof launching a\nsocial media company,\nand it's a nontrivial\nexplanation why that\nleads to robots in the home.\nBut it's basically\nthe algorithms\nthat fuel effective\nsocial robotics, so\nrobots that you can form\na deep connection with.\nAnd so I've been really-- yeah,\nI've been building prototypes\nbut struggling that\nI don't have maybe,\nif I were to be critical,\nthe guts to launch a company.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or the time.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well,\nit's combined.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nyou've got the guts.\nI mean, it's clear if you'll\ndo an interview with the Pfizer\nCEO and you're considering\nputting this Tate\nfellow on your podcast and\nyou've gone to the Ukraine\nthat you have the guts.\nIt means not doing quite\na lot of other things.\nLEX FRIDMAN: That's what I mean.\nIt does take-- the thing\nis, as many people know,\nwhen you fill your\nday and you're busy,\nthat busyness becomes an excuse\nthat you use against doing\nthe things that scare you.\nA lot of people use\nfamily in this way.\nYou know, my wife,\nmy kids, I can't.\nWhen in reality some of the most\nsuccessful people have a wife\nand have kids and have\nfamilies and they still do it.\nAnd so a lot of times we can\nfill the day with busy work,\nwith--\nyeah, of course, I have podcasts\nand all this kind of stuff.\nAnd they make me happy and\nthey're all-- they're wonderful\nand there's research,\nthere's teaching, and so on.\nBut all of that can just serve\nas an excuse from the thing\nthat my heart says is\nthe right thing to do,\nand that's why I don't\nhave the guts, the guts\nto say no to\nbasically everything\nand then to focus all out.\nBecause part of it is\nI'm unlikely to fail\nat anything in my life\ncurrently because I've already\nfound a comfortable place.\nWith a startup it's\nmostly going to be--\nmost likely going to\nbe a failure, if not\nan embarrassing failure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nthe machine learning data\nthat I'm aware of--\nI don't know a lot\nabout machine learning,\nbut within the realm\nof neuroscience,\nsay that a failure\nrate of about 15%\nis optimal for\nneuroplasticity and growth.\nWhether or not that translates\nto all kinds of practices\nisn't clear, but getting\ntrials right 85% of the time\nseems to be optimal\nfor language learning,\nseems to be optimal\nfor mathematics,\nand it seems to be optimal\nfor physical pursuits\non average, right?\nI'm sure I'm going--\nyou have more machine\nlearning geeks\nthat listen to your podcast\nthan listen to this podcast,\nbut it doesn't mean you have\nto fail on 15% of your weight\nsets, folks.\nI mean, it could be 16%.\nNo, I'm just kidding.\nIt's not exact, but it's a\npretty good rule of thumb.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I think a\nlot of startup founders\nwould literally murder\nfor 85% chance of success.\nI think given all the\nopportunities I have,\nthe skill set, the funding,\nall that kind of stuff,\nmy chances are relatively\nhigh for success.\nBut what relatively high\nmeans in the startup world\nis still far, far below 85.\nYou're talking about\nsingle digit percentages.\nMost startups fail.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI think it means--\nthe decision to focus on the\ncompany and not on other things\nmeans the decision to close\nthe hatch on dopamine retrieval\nfrom all these other things that\nare very predictable sources\nof dopamine.\nNot that everything is\ndopamine, but dopamine\nis, I think, the primary\nchemical driver of motivation.\nIf you know that you can get\nsome degree of satisfaction\nfrom scrolling social media\nor from that particular cup\nof coffee, that's what\nyou're going to do.\nThat's what you're going to\nconsume unless you somehow\ninvert the algorithm\nand you say,\nit's actually my\ndenial of myself\ndrinking that coffee that's\ngoing to be the dopamine.\nRight?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthat's the beauty\nof having a forebrain is that\nyou can make those decisions.\nThis is the essence,\nI do believe,\nof what we see of David Goggins.\nThere's much more there.\nThere's a person that none\nof us know and only he knows,\nof course.\nBut the idea that the pain\nis the source of dopamine.\nThe limbic friction, as I\nsometimes like to call it,\nis the source of dopamine.\nThat runs counter to how\nmost nervous systems work,\nbut it's decision based, right?\nIt's not because his\nmusculature is a certain way\nor he had CRISPR or something.\nIt's because he decides that.\nAnd I think that's\namazing, but what\nit means in terms of\nstarting a company\nand changing priorities is\na closing the hatch on all\nor many of the current\nsources of dopamine\nso that you can derive\ndopamine from the failures\nwithin this narrow\ncontext, and there's\na very reductionist view\nand neurocentric view\nof what we're talking about.\nBut I think about this a lot.\nI mean, the decision to choose\none relationship versus another\nis a decision to close down\nother opportunities, right?\nSo I think that the\ndecision to order one thing\noff the menu versus others\nis the decision to close down\nthose other hatches.\nSo I think that you\nabsolutely can do it.\nIt's just a question of,\ncan you flip the algorithm?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nRemap the source of\ndopamine to something else.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nAnd maybe go out there\nnot to succeed but make\nthe-- the journey is the\ndestination type thing,\nbut when you're financially\nvested in your time--\nand as far as I\nknow, we only get\none life, at least\non this planet\nand you want to spend\nthat wisely, right?\nLEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of the\npeople that surround you--\npeople are really\nimportant, and I\ndon't have people around me that\nsay you should do a start up.\nIt's very difficult to\nfind such people because--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is Austin\nbig startup culture right now?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it is.\nIt is.\nBut it doesn't make sense\nfor me to do a startup.\nThis is what the people\nthat love me my whole life\nhave been telling me,\nit doesn't make sense\nwhat you're doing right now.\nJust do the thing you\nwere doing previously.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Why\ndo I get the sense\nthat because they\nare saying this\nyou're apt to go against them?\nLEX FRIDMAN: No.\nActually, I was never\nthat, unfortunately.\nUnfortunately, I need--\nI've talked to people I love,\nmy parents, family, and so on,\nfriends.\nI'm one of those people that\nneeds unconditional support\nfor difficult things.\nI know myself coaching\nwise is good--\nso here's how I\nget coached best.\nLet's say wrestling.\nI like a coach that says,\nyou want to win the Olympics?\nThey will not-- if\nI say I want to win\nthe gold medal at the\nOlympics in freestyle\nwrestling I want a coach that\ndoesn't blink once and hears me\nand believes that I\ncan do it, and then\nis viciously intense and\ncruel to me on that pursuit.\nIf you want to do\nthis, let's do this.\nRight?\nBut that's support.\nThat positivity, I don't--\nI'm never-- I'm not energized,\nnor do I see that as love,\na person saying--\nbasically criticizing that.\nSaying, you're too old to win\nthe Olympic gold medal, right?\nOr all the things\nyou can come up with.\nThat's not helpful to me\nand I can't find a dopamine,\nor I haven't yet, a dopamine\nsource from the haters.\nBasically people that are\ncriticizing you, trying\nto prove them wrong.\nIt never got me off.\nIt never--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas some\npeople seem to like that.\nI mean, David Goggins\nseems to come to mind.\nHe seems driven by many sources.\nHe has access--\nI don't know because\nI've never asked him,\nbut if I were to\nventure a guess,\nI'd say that he probably\nhas a lot of options\ninside his head as how to\npush through challenge.\nNot just overcome pain,\nbut he'll post sometimes\nabout the fact that\npeople will say\nthis or people will do this\nand talk about the pushback\napproach.\nHe'll also talk\nabout the pushback\napproach that's purely\ninternal that doesn't\ninvolve anyone else.\nGreat versatility there.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nThere's literally\nlike a voice he\nyells that represents\nsome kind of devil that\nwants him to fail,\nand he calls them\nbitch and all kinds of things\nsaying, you know, fuck you.\nI'm not.\nThere's always an enemy and\nhe's going against that enemy.\nI mean, I wish--\nmaybe that's something.\nI mean, it's really interesting.\nMaybe you can remap it this\nway so that you can construct--\nthat's a kind of\nobvious mechanism.\nConstruct an amorphous\nblob that is a hater that\nwants you to fail, right?\nThat's kind of the\nDavid Goggins thing.\nAnd that blob says you're\ntoo weak, you're too dumb,\nyou're too old,\nyou're too fat, you're\ntoo whatever, and getting you\nto want to quit and so on.\nAnd then you start getting\nangry at that blob,\nand maybe that's\na good motivator.\nI haven't personally\nreally tried that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I've\nhad external challenge when\nI was a postdoc, very\nprominent laboratory--\nseveral prominent\nlaboratories, in fact,\nwere working on the\nsame thing that I was,\nand I was just\nthis lowly postdoc\nworking on a project\npretty independent\nfrom the lab I was in.\nAnd there was\ncompetition but there\nwas plenty of room for everybody\nto win, but in my head--\nand frankly, I won't\ndisclose who this is.\nAnd because there was some\nlegitimate competition there\nand a little bit of\nfriction-- not too much,\nhealthy scientific friction--\nyeah, I might have pushed\na few extra hours or more,\na little bit.\nI have to say, it\nfelt metabolizing.\nIt felt catabolic, right?\nI couldn't be sustained by it.\nAnd I contrast that with\nthe podcast or the work\nthat my laboratory\nis doing now focused\non stress and human performance,\net cetera, and it's pure love.\nIt's pure curiosity and love.\nI mean, there are hard\ndays, but I never-- there's\nno adversary in the picture.\nThey're the practical\nworkings of life that--\nLEX FRIDMAN: That was the thing\nthat Joe really inspired me on,\nand people do create\nadversarial relationships\nin podcasting because you get--\nYouTubers do this.\nThey hate seeing somebody\nelse be successful.\nThere's a feeling of\njealousy, and some people even\nsee that as healthy.\nMr. Beast is somebody, some\nof these popular YouTubers,\nhow do they get 100 million\nviews and I only get 20 views?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.\nBeast devoted his entire--\naccording to him,\nhis entire life\nhe's been focused on becoming\nthis massive YouTube channel.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, that,\nhe's inspiring in many ways,\nbut there's some\npeople that become\nfamous for doing much less\ninsane pursuit of greatness\nthan Mr. Beast.\nPeople become famous and\non social media and so on,\nand it's easy to\nbe jealous of them.\nOne of the early things\nI've learned from Joe just\nbeing a fan of his\npodcast is how much\nhe celebrated everybody.\nAnd again, maybe I ruined\nmy whole dopamine thing\nbut I don't get energized by\npeople that become popular.\nIn the podcasting\nspace and YouTube,\nit doesn't-- it's awesome.\nAll of it is awesome and\nI'm inspired by that.\nBut the problem is that's\nnot a good motivator.\nInspiration is like, oh,\ncool, humans can do this.\nThis is beautiful.\nBut it's not--\nI'm looking.\nI'm looking for a\nforcing function.\nThat's why I gave away\nthe salary from MIT.\nI was hoping my bank\naccount had zero.\nThat would be a forcing\nfunction to be like, oh shit.\nYou know?\nAnd you're not allowed\nto have a normal job,\nso I wanted to launch--\nand then the podcast\nbecomes a source of income.\nSo it's like, goddammit.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nYeah.\nWell, and here I have\nto confess my biases.\nYou are so good at what you\ndo in the realm of podcast--\nand you're excellent at\nother things as well,\nI just have less\nexperience in those things.\nI know here I'm taking\nthe liberty of speaking\nfor many, many people\nin just saying,\nI sure as hell hope you\ndon't shut down the podcast.\nBut as your friend\nand as somebody\nwho cares very deeply about\nyour happiness and your deeper\nsatisfaction, if it's\nin your heart's heart\nto do a company, well then,\ndamn it, do the company.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And a lot\nof it I wouldn't even\ncategorize as happiness.\nI don't know if you have\nthings like that in your life,\nbut I'm probably the happiest\nI could possibly be right now.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's wonderful.\nLEX FRIDMAN: But\nthe thing is there's\na longing for the\nstart up that has\nnothing to do with happiness.\nIt's something else.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's that itch.\nThat's that itch.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I'm pretty sure\nI'll be less happy because it's\na really tough process.\nI mean, to whatever degree\nyou can extract happiness\nfrom struggle, yes, maybe.\nBut I don't see it.\nI think I'll have some\nvery, very low points.\nThere's a lot of people\nwho find companies--\nfound companies know about.\nAnd I also want to\nbe in a relationship,\nI want to get married,\nand sure as hell\na startup is not\ngoing to increase\nthe likelihood of that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We\ncould start up a family\nand start a company.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's a--\nI'm a huge believer\nin that, which\nis get in a relationship\nat a low point\nin your life, which is--\n[LAUGHTER]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry.\nI'm not disputing your stance,\nnor am I agreeing with it.\nIt's just every once\nin a while there's\na Lex Fridmanism that hits a\nparticular circuit in my brain.\nI have to just laugh out loud.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I just\nthink that it's\neasy to have a relationship\nwhen everything is good.\nThe relationships that become\nstrong and are tested quickly\nare the ones when\nshit is going down.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then\nthere's hope for me yet.\nBefore we sat down I was\nhaving a conversation\nwith my podcast\nproducer, who is a--\nI wouldn't say avid, rather he's\na rabid consumer of podcasts\nand finds these amazing\npodcasts, small podcasts\nand unique episodes.\nAnyway, we were talking\nabout some stuff\nthat he had seen and read\nin the business sector,\nand he was talking about\nthe difference between job,\ncareer, and a calling, right?\nAnd I think he was\nextracting this\nfrom conversations of CEOs\nand founders, et cetera.\nI forget the specific\nfounders that\nbrought this to light for him.\nBut that this idea that\nif you focus on a job\nyou can make an income, and\nhopefully you enjoy your job\nor not hate it too much.\nA career represents a\nsort of, in my mind,\na kind of series of\nevolutions that one\ncan go through-- junior\nprofessor, tenure, et cetera.\nBut a calling has a whole\nother level of energetic pull\nto it because it\nincludes career and job\nand it includes this\nconcept of a life.\nIt's very hard to draw the line\nbetween a calling in career\nand a calling in the\nother parts of your life.\nSo the question,\ntherefore, is, do\nyou feel a calling\nto start this company\nor is it more of a compulsion\nthat irritates you?\nIs it something you\nwish would go away\nor is it something that\nyou hope won't go away?\nLEX FRIDMAN: No, I\nhope it won't go away.\nIt's a calling.\nIt's a calling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's beautiful.\nLEX FRIDMAN: It's like\nwhen I see a robot--\nwhen I first\ninteracted with robots,\nand it became even stronger the\nmore sophisticated the robots\nI interacted, with\nI see a magic there.\nAnd you're like,\nyou look around,\ndoes anyone else see this magic?\nIt's kind of like maybe\nwhen you fall in love,\nlike that feeling.\nDoes anyone else\nnotice this person\nthat just walked in the room?\nI feel that way\nabout robots, and I\ncan elaborate what that\nmeans but I'm not even sure I\ncan convert it into words.\nI just feel like the\nsocial integration\nof robots in society will create\na really interesting world.\nAnd our ability to\nanthropomorphize\nwhen we look at a robot and\nour ability to feel things\nwhen we look at a robot is\nsomething that most of us\ndon't yet experience,\nbut I think\neverybody will experience\nin the next few decades.\nAnd I just want to be\na part of exploring\nthat because it hasn't been\nreally thoroughly explored.\nThe best roboticists\nin the world\nare not currently working\non that problem at all.\nThey try to avoid human\nbeings completely,\nand nobody's really\nworking that problem\nin terms of when you\nlook at the numbers.\nAll the big tech companies\nthat are investing money,\nthe closest thing\nto that is Alexa\nand basically being a servant\nto help tell you the weather\nor play music and so on.\nIt's not trying to\nform a deep connection.\nAnd so sometimes you\njust notice the thing.\nNot only do I notice the magic.\nThere's a gut\nfeeling, which I try\nnot to speak to because\nthere's no track record,\nbut I feel like I can be good\nat bringing that magic out\nof the robot.\nAnd there's no data that\nsays I would be good at that,\nbut there's a feeling.\nIt's just a feeling.\nBecause I've done\nso many things--\nI love doing playing guitar,\nall that kind of stuff, jujitsu.\nI've never felt that feeling.\nWhen I'm doing\njujitsu I don't feel\nthe magic of the genius\nrequired to be extremely good.\nAt guitar I don't\nfeel any of that.\nBut I've noticed that in\nothers, great musicians,\nthey notice the magic\nabout the thing they do\nand they ran with it.\nAnd I just always thought--\nI think it had a different\nform before I knew robots\nexisted, before I existed.\nThe form was more about\nthe magic between humans.\nI think of it as love, but\nthe smile that two friends\nhave towards each other\nwhen I was really young.\nAnd people would be excited\nwhen they first know each other\nand notice each other,\nand there's that moment\nthat they share that\nfeeling together.\nI was like, wow, that's\nreally interesting.\nIt is really interesting\nthat these two\nseparate intelligent\norganisms are\nable to connect all of a sudden\non this deep emotional level.\nIt's like, huh.\nIt's just beautiful to see,\nand I notice the magic of that.\nAnd then when I started a\nprogramming-- programming,\nperiod, but then programming\nAI systems, you realize, oh,\nthat could be--\nthat's not just between\nhumans and humans.\nThat could be humans and\nother entities, dogs, cats,\nand robots.\nAnd so I-- for some reason\nit hit me the most intensely\nwhen I saw robots.\nSo yeah, it's a calling.\nBut it's a calling that I can\njust enjoy the vision of it,\nthe vision of a future world, of\nan exciting future world that's\nfull of cool stuff, or I can\nbe part of building that.\nAnd being part of\nbuilding that means\ndoing the hard work\nof capitalism, which\nis like raising funds from\npeople, which for me, right\nnow, is the easy part, and\nthen hiring a lot of people.\nI don't know how much you know\nabout hiring, but hiring--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring\nexcellent people.\nLEX FRIDMAN:\nExcellent people that\nwill define the\ntrajectory of not only\nyour company, but your whole\nexistence as a human being.\nAnd building it up, not\nfailing them because now\nthey all depend on you,\nand not failing the world\nwith an opportunity\nto bring something\nthat brings joy to people.\nAnd all of that\npressure, just non-stop\nfires that you have to put out.\nThe drama, the having\nto work with people\nyou've never worked with like\nlawyers and human resources\nand supply chain.\nAnd because this is\nvery compute heavy,\nthe computer infrastructure,\nmanaging security,\ncybersecurity, because you're\ndealing with people's data.\nSo now you have to understand\nnot only the cybersecurity\nof data and the privacy, how\nto maintain privacy correctly\nwith data, but also the\npsychology of people trusting\nyou with their data.\nAnd how, if you look at Mark\nZuckerberg and Jack Dorsey\nand those folks,\nthey seem to be hated\nby a large number of people.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed--\nI didn't--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Much less so, yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think I\nalways think of Jack as a loved\nindividual, but--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, you\nhave a very positive view\nof the world, yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I like Jack a\nlot and I like his mind and I--\nsomeone close to him\ndescribed him to me\nrecently as he's an\nexcellent listener.\nThat's what they\nsaid about Jack,\nand that's my\nexperience of him too.\nVery private person so\nwe'll leave it at that.\nBut listen, I think\nJack Dorsey is\none of the greats of\nthe last 200 years\nand is just much quieter\nabout his stance on things\nthan a lot of people.\nBut much of what we see in\nthe world that's wonderful,\nI think we owe him\na debt of gratitude.\nI'm just voicing my\nstance here, but--\nLEX FRIDMAN: And the person.\nThis is really important.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLEX FRIDMAN: A wonderful\nperson, a brilliant person,\na good person,\nbut you still have\nto pay the price of making\nany kind of mistakes\nas the head of a company.\nYou don't get any extra bonus\npoints for being a good person.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But his\nwillingness to go on Rogan\nand deal directly and say,\nI don't know an answer\nto that in some cases.\nBut to deal directly with some\nreally challenging questions\nto me earned him\ntremendous respect.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nAs an individual.\nHe was still part of him--\nyou've said-- OK,\nand I love Jack too,\nand I interact with him often.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's\nbeen on your podcast.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes.\nBut he's also part of a\nsystem, as we talked about,\nand I would argue that Jack\nshouldn't have brought anyone\nelse with him on that podcast.\nIf you go--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOh, that's right.\nHe had a cadre of--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Oh, he had I\nguess the head legal with him.\nAnd also it requires a\ntremendous amount of skill\nto go on a podcast\nlike Joe Rogan\nand be able to win over\nthe trust of people\nby being able to be\ntransparent and communicate\nhow the company really works\nbecause the more you reveal\nabout how a social\nmedia company works,\nthe more you open\nup for security,\nthe vector of attacks increases.\nAlso, there's a lot of\ndifficult decisions in terms\nof censorship and\nnot that are made\nthat if you make\nthem transparent\nyou're going to get an order\nof magnitude more hate.\nSo you have to make all\nthose kinds of decisions,\nand I think that's one of\nthe things I have to realize\nis you have to take that\navalanche of potentially\nhate if you make mistakes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you\nhave a very clear picture\nof this architecture\nof what's required\nin order to create a company.\nOf course, there's\ndivision of labor too.\nI mean, you don't have to do\nall of those things in detail,\nbut finding people that\nare excellent to do--\nto run the critical\nsegments is obviously key.\nI'll just say what\nI said earlier,\nwhich is if it's in your heart's\nheart to start a company,\nif that, indeed,\nis your calling,\nand it sounds like it\nis, then I can't wait.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Does the\nheart have a heart?\nI don't know.\nWhat's that\nexpression even mean?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not.\nLEX FRIDMAN: We\nromanticize the heart.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In my lab\nat one point, early days\nwe worked on cuttlefish, and\nthey have multiple hearts,\nbut they pump green\nblood, believe it or not.\nVery fascinating animal.\nSpeaking of hearts\nand green blood,\nearlier today\nbefore we sat down I\nsolicited four questions on\nInstagram in a brief post.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Do you want to--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If you'll--\nLEX FRIDMAN: --look\nat some of them?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, let's\ntake these in real time.\nMy podcast team is always\nteasing me that I never\nhave any charge on my phone.\nI'm one of these people that\nlikes to run in the yellow,\nor whatever it is.\nLEX FRIDMAN: An iPhone?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLEX FRIDMAN: It's funny\nhow always the iPhone\npeople are out of battery.\nIt's weird.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI just got a new one.\nLEX FRIDMAN: So weird.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, this\none has plenty of battery.\nI just got a new one so\nI have different numbers\nfor different things,\npersonal and work, et cetera.\nI'm trying that now.\nAll right.\nGet into the--\nLEX FRIDMAN: I have a chess\nthing too to mention to you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOh, yes, please.\nWill I insult you if I look up\nthese questions as you ask me?\nLEX FRIDMAN: No, no.\nBut I will insult you by asking\nyou this question because I\nthink it's hilarious.\nSo there's been a controversy\nabout cheating where\nHans Niemann, who\nis a 2,700 player--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah.\nLEX FRIDMAN: --was\naccused of cheating.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I saw that\nclip on your clips channel.\nBy the way, I love\nyour clips channel,\nbut I listen to\nyour full channel.\nLEX FRIDMAN: The big accusation\nis that he cheated by having--\nI mean, it's half\njoke but it's starting\ngetting me to wonder whether--\nso that you can cheat by having\nvibrating anal beads so you\ncan send messages to--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let's\nrephrase that statement.\nNot you can, but one can.\nLEX FRIDMAN: One can.\nOne can.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, thank you.\nLEX FRIDMAN: That was\na personal attack, yes.\nBut it made me realize, I mean--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just going\nto adjust myself in my seat\nhere.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I use\nit all the time\nfor podcasting to\nsend myself messages\nto remind myself of notes.\nBut it's interesting.\nI mean, it--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not\ngoing to call you again.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that's\nexactly where I keep my phone.\nIt did get me down this\nwhole rabbit hole of, well,\nhow would you be able to\nsend communication in order\nto cheat in different sports?\nI mean, that doesn't even have\nto do with chess in particular,\nbut it's interesting\nin chess and poker\nthat there's mechanisms\nmodern day where\nyou're streaming live\nthe competition so people\ncan watch it on TV.\nIf they can only send\nyou a signal back, they--\nit's just a fun little\nthing to think about\nand if it's possible\nto pull off.\nSo I wanted to get your\nscientific evaluation of that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: To\ncheat using some sort\nof interoceptive device?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\nVibrating of some kind.\nYeah.\nOr no, no.\nThat's one way to send\nsignals is, like, Morse code,\nbasically.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSo there's a famous--\nI believe there's\na famous real world\nstory of physics students--\nI'm going to get\nsome of this wrong\nso I'm saying this in\nkind of coarse form\nso that somebody\nwill correct this.\nBut I believe it was physics\ngraduate students from UC Santa\nCruz or somewhere else,\nmaybe it was Caltech--\na bunch of universities\nso that no one associates\nit with any one university\nthat went to Vegas\nand used some sort of tactile\ndevice for card counting thing.\nThis was actually\ndemonstrated also--\nnot this particular\nincident, I don't think--\nin the movie Casino\nwhere they spotted a--\nI remember Robert\nDe Niro, who you\nhave a not so vague resemblance\nto, by the way, in Taxi Driver.\nLEX FRIDMAN: God, I wish I had\na De Niro impression right now.\nTravis Bickle.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nLook it up, folks.\nTravis Bickle is if Lex ever\nshaved his head into a Mohawk.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I would.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So he had a\ntapping device on his ankle\nthat was signaling.\nSomeone else was counting\ncards and then signaling\nto that person.\nSo yeah, that could be\ndone in the tactile way.\nIt could be done,\nobviously, earpieces\nif it's deep earpiece.\nI think there are ways\nthat they look for that.\nCertainly any kind\nof vibrational device\nin whatever orifice provided\nsomeone could pay attention\nto that while still\nplaying the game.\nYeah, I think it's\nentirely possible.\nNow, could it be\ndone purely neurally?\nCould there be\nsomething that was--\nand listen, it wouldn't have\nto even be below the skull.\nThis is where whenever people\nhear about Neuralink or brain\nmachine interface\nthey always think,\noh, you have to drill\ndown below the skull\nand put a chip below\ninto the skull.\nI think there are people\nwalking around nowadays\nwith glucose monitoring devices,\nlike Levels-- which I've used\nand it was very informative\nfor me, actually,\nas a kind of an experiment.\nGave me a lot of interesting\ninsights about my blood sugar\nregulation, how it reacts to\ndifferent foods, et cetera.\nWell, you can implant\na tactile device\nbelow the skin with\na simple incision.\nActually, one of the\nneurosurgeons at Neuralink\nI know well because he\ncame up at some point\nthrough my laboratory\nand was at Stanford,\nand he actually has put in a\nradio receiver in his hand,\nand his wife has it too.\nAnd he can open locks\nof his house and things\nlike that, so he's been doing--\nLEX FRIDMAN: Under the skin?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Under the skin.\nYou can go to--\nLEX FRIDMAN: How does that work?\nSo how do you use--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A piercer.\nYou go to a body\npiercer type person\nand they can just\nslide it under there,\nand it's got a battery\nlife of something\nand some fairly long duration.\nLEX FRIDMAN: How do you\nexperience the tactile--\nthe haptics of it?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.\nThat just allows him to\nopen certain locks with just\nhis hand, but you could easily\nput some sort of tactile device\nin there.\nLEX FRIDMAN: But does it\nhave to connect to the nerves\nor is it just like--\njust vibration?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNo, just vibration.\nLEX FRIDMAN: And\nyou can probably\nsense it even if it's\nunder the skin, I wonder.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit can be by-- it\ncan be Bluetooth linked.\nI mean, I've seen--\nthere's an Engineering\nLaboratory at the University\nof Illinois, Champaign-Urbana,\nthat's got an amazing\ndevice which is\nabout the size of a Band-Aid.\nIt goes on the\nclavicles and it uses\nsound waves pinged into the\nbody to measure cavitation.\nThink about this for a moment.\nThis is being used in\nthe military where,\nlet's say, you're leading\nan operation or something.\nPeople are getting shot,\nshot at, and on a laptop\nyou can see where the\nbullet entry points are.\nAre people dead?\nAre they bleeding out?\nEntry, exit points.\nYou can get-- take it out\nof the battlefield scenario.\nYou can get breathing, body\nposition 24 hours a day.\nThere's so much that you can\ndo looking at cavitation.\nSo these same sorts of\ndevices on 12 hour Bluetooth\ncould be used to send\nall sorts of signals.\nMaybe every time you're\nsupposed to hold your hand--\nI'm not a good gambler\nso I only play roulette\nwhen I go to Vegas because\nyou just long, boring games,\nbut you get some good mileage\nout of each out of each run,\nusually.\nBut maybe every time\nyou're supposed to hold,\nthe person gets a\nstomach cinching\nbecause this is stimulating\nthe vagus a little bit\nand they get a little\nbit of an ache.\nSo it doesn't have\nto be Morse code.\nIt can be yes, no, maybe.\nRight?\nIt can be green, red,\nyellow type signaling.\nIt doesn't have to be very\nsophisticated to give somebody\na significant advantage.\nAnyway, I haven't thought\nabout this in detail\nbefore this conversation\nbut, oh, yeah,\nthere's an immense landscape.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I don't\nknow if you know\na poker player named Phil Ivey?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, I don't\nfollow the gambling thing.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well,\nhe's considered\nto be one of the\ngreatest poker players\nof all time legitimately.\nHe's just incredibly good.\nBut he got-- there's\nthis big case where\nhe was accused of\ncheating and prove--\nand it's not really\ncheating, which\nis what's really fascinating.\nIs it turns out--\nso he plays poker.\nTexas Hold'em, mostly,\nbut all kinds of poker.\nIt turns out that the grid\non the back of the cards\nis often printed a\nlittle bit imperfectly,\nand so you can use the\nasymmetry of the imperfections\nto try to figure\nout certain cards.\nSo if you play and you remember\nthat a certain card is, like--\nI think the 8 in that deck that\nhe was accused of-- an 8 and 9\nwere slightly different\nsymmetry wise.\nSo he can now ask\nthe dealer actually\nto rotate it to\ncheck the symmetry.\nSo you would ask the dealer\nto rotate the card to see that\nthere's-- to detect the\nasymmetry of the back\nof the card, and now he\nknows which cards are\n8's and 9's or likelier to be\n8's and 9's, and he was using\nthat information to play\npoker and win a lot of money.\nBut it's just a\nslight advantage.\nAnd his case is-- and\nin fact, the judge\nfound this, that he's\nnot actually cheating,\nbut it's not right.\nYou can't use this kind\nof extra information.\nSo it's fascinating that you\ncan discover these little holes\nin games if you pay\nclose enough attention.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nIt's fascinating.\nAnd I think that I\ndid watch that clip\nabout the potential of a\ncheating event in chess,\nand the fact that a\nnumber of chess players\nadmit to cheating at some\npoint in their career.\nVery, very interesting.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well,\nit was online.\nSo online cheating\nis easier, right?\nWhen you're playing\nonline cheating\nin a game where the machine\nis much better than the human,\nit's very difficult to\nprove that you're human.\nAnd that applies, by the\nway, another really big thing\nis in social media, the bots.\nIf you're running a\nsocial media company\nyou have to deal with the\nbots and they become--\none of the really\nexciting things\nin machine learning and\nartificial intelligence, to me,\nis the very fast improvement\nof language models.\nSo neural networks\nthat generate text,\nthat interpret text, that\ngenerate from text, images\nand all that kind of stuff.\nBut you're now going to\ncreate incredible bots that\nlook awfully a lot like humans.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, at least they're\nnot going to be those\ncrypto bots that\nseem to populate my comment\nsection when I post anything\non Instagram.\nI actually delete those\neven though they add\nto the comment roster and if--\nthey bother me so much.\nI spend at least 10, 15 minutes\non each post just deleting\nthose.\nI don't know what\nthey need to do\nbut I'm not interested\nin those, whatever\nit is they're offering.\nSpeaking of nonbots,\nI'm going to assume\nthat all the questions\nare not from bots.\nThere are a lot of\nquestions here--\nmore than 10,000 questions.\nGoodness.\nI'll just take a few,\nworking from top to bottom.\nWhat ideas have you been\nwrestling with lately?\nAnd I think about\nthe company as one,\nbut as I scroll to the\nnext, what are some others?\nLEX FRIDMAN: Well, some of\nthe things we've talked about,\nwhich is the ideas of how\nto understand what is true,\nwhat is true about a human\nbeing, how to reveal that,\nhow to reveal that\nthrough conversation, how\nto challenge that\nproperly, that it leads\nto understanding not derision.\nSo that applies to\neverybody from Donald Trump\nto Vladimir Putin.\nAlso another idea is there's\na deep distrust of science\nin trying to understand-- the\ngrowing distrust of science,\ntrying to understand what's\nthe role of those of us\nthat have a foot in the\nscientific community,\nhow to regain some\nof that trust.\nAlso, there's-- as we talked\nabout, how to find and how to--\nyeah, how to find and how to\nmaintain a good relationship.\nI mean, that's really been--\nI've never felt\nquite as lonely as I\nhave this year with Ukraine.\nIt's just like, so many\ntimes I would just lay there\nand just feeling so deeply alone\nbecause I felt that my home--\nnot my home literally\nbecause I'm an American.\nI'm a proud American.\nI'll die an American.\nBut my home in the\nsense of generationally,\nmy family's home, is now going--\nhas been changed forever.\nThere's no more being proud of\nbeing from the former Russia\nor Ukraine.\nIt's now a political\nmessage to say--\nto show your pride, and so\nit's been extremely lonely.\nAnd within that world, with\nall the things I'm pursuing,\nhow do you find a\nsuccessful relationship?\nIt has been tough.\nBut obviously-- and\nthere's a huge number\nof technical ideas\nwith the startup of,\nlike, how the hell do\nyou make this thing work?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nthe relationship topic\nis one we talked a\nlittle bit about,\nand last time we touched on\nin a little bit more detail.\nWe're going to come back to\nthat, so I've made a note here.\nWhat or who inspired\nLex, you, to wear\na suit every time you podcast?\nThat's a good question.\nI don't know the answer to that.\nLEX FRIDMAN: So there's two\nanswers to that question.\nOne is a suit and two is\na black suit and black tie\nbecause I used to do--\nI used to have more variety,\nwhich is like it was always\na black suit but\nI would sometimes\ndo a red tie and a blue tie.\nBut that was mostly me\ntrying to fit in to society\nbecause varieties-- you're\nsupposed to have some variety.\nWhat inspired me at first\nwas a general culture\nthat doesn't take\nitself seriously\nin terms of how you present\nyourself to the world.\nSo in academia,\nin the tech world,\nat Google, everybody was wearing\npajamas and very relaxed.\nIn the tech.\nI don't know how it\nis in the science,\nin the chemistry,\nbiology, and so on.\nBut in computer science\neverybody was very--\nI mean, very relaxed in\nterms of the stuff they\nwear so I wanted to try\nto really take myself\nseriously and take every\nsingle moment seriously\nand everything I do\nseriously, and the suit\nmade me feel that way.\nI don't know how it looks,\nbut it made me feel that way.\nAnd I think, in terms\nof people I look up\nto that wore a suit that made\nme think of that is probably\nRichard Feynman.\nI see--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He was\na wonderful human being.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the\nepitome of class and humor\nand brilliance, and\nobviously I could never\ncome close to that kind of--\nbe able to simply explain\nreally complicated ideas\nand to have humor and wit,\nbut definitely aspire to that.\nAnd then there's\njust the Mad Men,\nthat whole era of the '50s,\nthe classiness of that.\nThere's something\nabout a suit that\nboth removes the importance\nof fashion from the character.\nYou see the person.\nI think not to--\nI forgot who said this.\nMight be, like, Coco Chanel\nor somebody like this.\nIs that you wear a shabby dress\nand everyone sees the dress.\nYou wear a beautiful dress\nand everybody sees the woman.\nSo in that sense it was--\nhopefully I'm quoting\nthat correctly, but--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I think\nthere's a sense in which\na simple, classy suit\nallows people to focus\non your character and then do\nso with the full responsibility\nof that, this is who I am.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nthat, and I love what\nyou said just prior to that.\nMy father, who, again,\nis always asking me\nwhy I don't dress formally\nlike you do always\nsaid to me growing\nup, if you overdress\nslightly, at least people know\nthat you took them seriously.\nSo it's a sign of respect for\nyour audience too in my eyes.\nSomeone asked, is there an AI\nequivalent of psychedelics?\nAnd I'm assuming they\nmean is there something\nthat machines can do\nfor themselves in order\nto alter their neural circuitry\nthrough unconventional\nactivation patterns.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously.\nWell, I don't know exactly\nhow psychedelics work,\nbut you can see that with\nall the diffusion models\nnow with Dali and the\nstable diffusion that\ngenerates from text, art.\nIt's basically a small\ninjection of noise\ninto a system that has\na deep representation\nof visual information.\nSo it is able to convert text to\nart in introducing uncertainty\ninto that noise into that.\nThat's kind of maybe.\nI could see that as a\nparallel to psychedelics,\nand it's able to create\nsome incredible things.\nFrom a conceptual\nunderstanding of a thing,\nit can create incredible\nart that no human, I think,\ncould have at least\neasily created\nthrough a bit of\nintroduction of randomness.\nRandomness does a lot of work\nin the machine learning world.\nJust enough.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: There are\na lot of requests of you\nfor relationship,\na lot of requests\nabout statistics about you,\ndata about you specifically.\nFlipping past those,\nwhat was the hardest belt\nto achieve in jujitsu?\nI would have assumed\nthe black belt,\nbut is that actually true?\nLEX FRIDMAN: No.\nI mean, everybody has\na different journey\nthrough jujitsu, as people know.\nFor me, the black belt\nwas the ceremonial belt,\nwhich is not usually the case,\nbecause I fought the wars.\nI trained twice a day for I\ndon't know how many years--\nseven, eight years.\nI competed nonstop.\nI competed against people\nmuch better than me.\nI competed against many\nand beaten many black belts\nand brown belts.\nI think, for me personally,\nthe hardest belt\nwas the brown belt because,\nfor people who know jujitsu,\nthe size of tournament divisions\nfor blue belts and purple belts\nis just humongous.\nLike Worlds, when I competed\nat Worlds it was, like,\n140 people in a division,\nwhich means you have to win--\nI forget how many times,\nbut seven, eight, nine times\nin a row to medal.\nAnd so I just had to put in a\nlot of work during that time.\nAnd especially for competitors,\ninstructors usually\nreally make you earn a belt.\nSo to earn the purple belt was\nextremely difficult.\nExtremely difficult. And then\nto earn the brown\nbelt means I had\nto compete nonstop against other\npurple belts, which are young.\nYou're talking about-- the\npeople that usually compete\nare, like, 23, 24,\n25-year-olds that are shredded,\nincredible cardio.\nThey can, for some reason, are\nin their life where they can--\nno kids, nothing.\nThey can dedicate\neverything to this pursuit\nso they're training two,\nthree, four times a day.\nDiet is on point.\nYou're going-- and for me,\nbecause they're usually bigger\nand taller than me and\njust more aggressive,\nactual good athletes, yeah, I\nhad to go through a lot of wars\nto earn that brown\nbelt. But then--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I got to\ntry this jujitsu thing.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, you should.\nBut it's a different--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I tried it.\nI did the one class, but I\nreally want to embrace it.\nLEX FRIDMAN: As you know,\nmany pursuits like jujitsu\nare different if you're doing it\nin your 20s and 30s and later.\nIt's like it's a different--\nyou're not-- you can have a\nbit of an ego in your 20s.\nYou can have that\nfire under you,\nbut you should be more\nzenlike and wise and patient\nlater in life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, one would hope.\nThat's the wisdom.\nLEX FRIDMAN: I think\nRogan is still a meathead.\nHe still goes hard and\ncrazy and he's still\nsuper competitive on\nthat, so some people can--\nJocko is somebody like that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, whatever they're\ndoing they're doing something\nright because they're still\nin it, and that's\nsuper impressive.\nThere were far too many\nquestions to ask all of them,\nbut several, if not many, asked\na highly appropriate question\nfor where we are in the\narc of this discussion.\nAnd this is one, admittedly,\nthat you ask in your podcast\nall the time, but I\nget the great pleasure\nof being in the question\nasker seat today.\nAnd so, what is your\nadvice to young people?\nLEX FRIDMAN: So I just\ngave a lecture at MIT\nand the amount of love I\ngot there is incredible.\nAnd so of course, who\nyou're talking to is usually\nundergrads, maybe young\ngraduate students, and so there\none person did ask for advice\nas a question at the end.\nI did a bunch of Q&A. So my\nanswer was that the world will\ntell you to find a work-life\nbalance, to explore,\nto try to--\ntry different fields\nto see what you really\nconnect with, variety,\ngeneral education, all\nthat kind of stuff.\nAnd I said in your\n20s I think you\nshould find one thing\nyou're passionate about\nand work harder at that than\nyou worked at anything else\nin your life.\nAnd if it destroys\nyou, it destroys you.\nThat's advice for in your 20s.\nI don't know how universally\ntrue that advice is,\nbut I think at least\ngive that a chance.\nSacrifice, real sacrifice\ntowards a thing you\nreally care about,\nand work your ass off.\nThat said, I've\nmet so many people,\nand I'm starting to\nthink that advice is best\napplied or best tried in\nthe engineer disciplines,\nespecially programming.\nI think there's a bunch of\ndisciplines in which you\ncan achieve success\nwith much fewer hours,\nand it's much more\nimportant to actually\nhave a clarity of\nthinking and great ideas\nand have an energetic mind.\nThe grind in certain disciplines\ndoes not produce great work.\nI just know that in computer\nscience and programming\nit often does.\nSome of the best people ever\nthat have built systems,\nhave programmed systems are\nusually like the John Carmack\nkind of people that drink\nsoda, eat pizza, and program\n18 hours a day.\nSo I don't know actually.\nYou have to, I think, really\ngo discipline specific.\nSo my advice applies\nto my own life\nwhich has been mostly\nspent behind that computer,\nand for that you really, really\nhave to put in the hours.\nAnd what that means\nis essentially\nit feels like a grind.\nI do recommend that you should\nat least try it in your own.\nThat if you interview some of\nthe most accomplished people\never, I think if\nthey're honest with you\nthey're going to\ntalk about their 20s\nas a journey of a lot of pain\nand a lot of really hard work.\nI think what really\nhappens, unfortunately,\nis a lot of those successful\npeople later in life\nwill talk about\nwork-life balance.\nThey'll say, you\nknow what I learned\nfrom that process is that it's\nreally important to get, like,\nsun in the morning,\nto have health,\nto have good relationships.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire a chef.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, a chef.\nExactly.\nBut I think you have\nforgot-- those people have\nforgotten the value\nof the journey they\ntook to that lesson.\nI think work-life balance is\nbest learned the hard way.\nMy own perspective.\nThere are certain things you\ncan only learn the hard way,\nand so you should learn\nthat the hard way.\nYeah, so that's\ndefinitely advice.\nAnd I should say that I\nadmire people that work hard.\nIf you want to get\non my good side,\nI think there are the\npeople that give everything\nthey got towards something.\nIt doesn't actually\nmatter what it\nis, but towards achieving\nexcellence in a thing.\nThat's the highest thing that\nwe can reach for as human beings\nI think is excellence\nat a thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nWell, speaking of\nexcellent at a thing.\nWhether or not it's teaching\nat MIT or the podcast\nor the company that\nresides in the near future\nthat you create--\nonce again, I'm speaking for\nan enormous number of people\nthat excellence and hard\nwork, certainly, are woven\nthrough everything that you do.\nEvery time I sit down with\nyou I begin and finish\nwith such an immense feeling\nof joy and appreciation\nand gratitude, and it wouldn't\nbe a Lex Fridman podcast,\nor in case of Lex even\nbeing a guest on a podcast,\nif the word love weren't\nmentioned at least 10 times.\nSo the feelings of gratitude\nfor all the work you do,\nfor taking the time here today\nto share with us what you're\ndoing, your thoughts,\nyour insights, what\nyou're perplexed about and what\ndrives you and your callings.\nLEX FRIDMAN: Can I read a poem?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.\nHe was trying to\ncut me off post.\nThat was getting a little long.\nLEX FRIDMAN: No.\nNo, no, no.\nI was thinking\nabout this recently.\nIt's one of my favorite\nRobert Frost poems, and I--\nbecause I wrote several\nessays on it, as you do,\nbecause I think it's a\npopular one that's read.\nEssays being, like, trying\nto interpret poetry,\nand it's one that\nsticks with me.\nI mean, both its calm beauty,\nbut in the seriousness\nof what it means because I\nultimately think it's the--\nso \"Stopping by a Woods\non a Snowy Evening.\"\nI think it's ultimately\na human being, a man,\nasking the old Sisyphus, the\nold Camus question of, why live?\nI think this poem,\neven though it\ndoesn't seem like it is a\nquestion of a man contending\nwith suicide and\nchoosing to live.\nWhose woods these\nare, I think I know.\nHis house is in the\nvillage, though.\nHe will not see me stopping\nhere to watch his woods fill up\nwith snow.\nMy little horse\nmust think it queer\nto stop without a farmhouse near\nbetween the woods and frozen\nlake, the darkest\nevening of the year.\nHe gives this\nharness bells a shake\nto ask if there's some mistake.\nThe only other sound's the sweep\nof easy wind and downy flake.\nThe woods are lovely,\ndark, and deep,\nbut I have promises to keep\nand miles to go before I sleep,\nand miles to go before I sleep.\nThe woods representing\nthe darkness,\nthe comfort of the woods\nrepresenting death,\nand he's a man choosing to live.\nYeah, I think about that often,\nespecially my darker moments\nis you have promises to keep.\nThank you for having me, Andrew.\nYou're a beautiful human being.\nI love you, brother.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove you, brother.\nThank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion with Dr. Lex\nFridman, and special thanks
