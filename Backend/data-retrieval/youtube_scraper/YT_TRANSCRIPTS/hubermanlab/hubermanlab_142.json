    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is\nDr. Chris Palmer.\nDr. Chris Palmer\nis a medical doctor\nspecializing in psychiatry\nat Harvard Medical School.\nHe is the world expert\nin the relationship\nbetween metabolic disorders\nand psychiatric disorders.\nHe treats a variety of\ndifferent conditions,\nincluding psychosis, including\nschizophrenia, as well\nas attention deficit\nhyperactivity\ndisorder, obsessive compulsive\ndisorder, anxiety disorders,\nand depression among others.\nHe is best known\nfor understanding\nthe relationship\nbetween how metabolism\nand these various disorders\nof the mind interact.\nAnd indeed, today,\nhe describes not\nonly his own fascinating journey\ninto the field of psychiatry\nbut also his clinical\nand research experience\nusing diet that is\ndifferent forms of nutrition\nin order to treat various\npsychiatric disorders.\nHe describes some\nremarkable case studies\nof individuals and\ngroups of people\nwho have achieved tremendous\nrelief from the types\nof psychiatric\ndisorders that I just\nmentioned a few moments ago, as\nwell as new and emerging themes\nas to how metabolism\nand the mind\ninteract to control\nthings like obesity.\nIndeed, he raises the\nhypothesis that perhaps obesity,\nin many cases, is the\nconsequence of a brain\ndysfunction as opposed\nto the consequence\nof a metabolic dysfunction\nthat then impacts the brain.\nDuring today's episode,\nhe shares with us\nhis overriding hypotheses\nabout the critical roles\nthat mitochondrial function\nand dysfunction play\nin mental health\nand mental illness,\nand how various particular\ntypes of diets--\nranging from the\nketogenic diet to modified\nketogenic diet and\neven just slight\nadjustments in\ncarbohydrate intake--\ncan be used in order to\nchange mitochondrial function\nand bring relief for various\npsychiatric illnesses.\nHe also highlights the\nessential and important theme\nthat various diet interventions,\nincluding the ketogenic diet,\nwere not first developed\nfor sake of weight loss\nbut rather were\ndeveloped as treatments\nfor neurologic conditions,\nsuch as epilepsy.\nToday, he shares\nwith us how the foods\nthat we eat alone and in\ncombination, and how fasting--\nboth intermittent fasting\nand more lengthy fasts--\ncan interact with the way\nthat our brain functions\nto strongly control the way\nthat we think, feel, and behave.\nWhat's wonderful is that\nDr. Palmer not only explains\nthe science and his\nclinical expertise,\nbut also points to various\nactionable measures\nthat people can take in order\nto improve their mental health.\nI'd like to mention\nthat Dr. Palmer is also\nthe author of a\nterrific new book.\nThe title is Brain Energy:\nA Revolutionary Breakthrough\nin Understanding Mental\nHealth and Improving\nTreatment for Anxiety,\nDepression, OCD, PTSD and More.\nI've read the book, and\nit is a terrific read.\nI came away from this book with\na much evolved understanding\nof how the various psychiatric\ndisorders that I just\ndescribed, as well as\nADHD, emerge in people.\nAnd it has completely\nrevised my understanding\nabout the possible origins of\nvarious psychiatric disorders\nand the best ways to\ntreat them, including\nboth with medications but also\nwith nutritional approaches.\nIf you'd like to learn\nmore about Dr. Palmer's\nwork and the book, please\ngo to chrispalmermd.com.\nWe also provide\nlinks to the book\nand to his website in\nour show note captions.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nfor the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd as I've said many times\nbefore on this podcast,\nI am not a fan of\nthe word \"nootropics\"\nbecause it means smart drugs.\nAnd frankly, there are no\nspecific neural circuits\nin the brain or body for\nbeing, quote unquote, \"smart.\"\nThesis understands this.\nAnd they've developed\ncustom nootropics\nthat are designed\nto bring your brain\nand body into the state\nthat's ideal for what\nyou need to accomplish.\nThey use the highest\nquality ingredients,\nthings like\nphosphatidylserine, alpha GPC,\nmany ingredients\nthat I've talked\nabout before on this podcast\nand that I happen to use myself.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor over a year now.\nAnd I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nhave been a game changer.\nFor me, I like their\nnootropic for clarity.\nI use that before\ncognitive work often.\nAnd I like their\nnootropic for energy,\nand I often use that\nbefore workouts--\nin particular, workouts\nthat are especially intense.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nTake their 3-minute\nquiz, and Thesis\nwill send you four\ndifferent formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAgain, that's\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nAnd use the code\nHuberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've talked many\ntimes on this podcast\nabout the critical relationship\nbetween sleep and body\ntemperature.\nThat is, in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep\nthroughout the night,\nour body temperature\nneeds to drop by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd conversely, when we\nwake up in the morning,\nthat is, in large part,\nbecause of our body heating up\nby 1 to 3 degrees.\nNow, people have different\ncore body temperatures.\nAnd they tend to run colder or\nhotter throughout the night.\nEight Sleep allows you\nto adjust the temperature\nof your sleeping\nenvironment so that you\nhave the optimal temperature\nthat gets you the best night's\nsleep.\nI started sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover about eight months\nago, and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nI sleep so much deeper.\nI wake up far less during the\nmiddle of the night, if at all.\nAnd I wake up feeling far\nbetter than I ever have even\nafter the same amount of sleep.\nIf you want to try\nEight Sleeping,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to save\nup to $400 off their\nsleep fit

that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses\nand sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford.\nAnd everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with\nperformance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology, the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that\nyour visual system has\nto contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges in order\nfor you to see clearly--\nfor instance, when you move from\na sunny area to a shady area\nand back again, whether or not\nyou're looking at something up\nclose or often to the distance.\nROKA understands the\nbiology of the visual system\nand has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses\naccordingly so that you always\nsee with perfect clarity.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially\ndesigned for activities\nsuch as running and cycling.\nAnd indeed, they are\nvery lightweight.\nMost of the time I\ncan't even remember\nthat they're on my face.\nThey're so lightweight.\nBut the important thing to\nknow about ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses is\nthat while they\ncan be used during\nsports activities,\nthey also have a\nterrific aesthetic.\nAnd they can be used just as\nwell for wearing to work or out\nto dinner, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try

a\nlot of questions for you.\nAnd I'm really excited\nabout this topic\nbecause I think most people\nknow what mental illness is--\nor they have some\nidea what that is.\nMost people have some\nidea what nutrition is.\nFewer people certainly\nknow how closely\nthose things can interact.\nAnd I think everybody is\nfamiliar with the feeling\nof a food or the\ningestion of a food\nmaking them feel good\nin the short term.\nWhen we eat a food that\ntastes delicious to us\nor that we associate\nwith something nice,\nthen we feel good\nmentally and physically.\nWhereas, when we eat\nsomething that gives us\nfood poisoning or maybe even\nsomething that just doesn't\ntaste that great or\nthat we associate\nwith a bad experience, we feel\nless good in the short term.\nBut I believe that very\nfew people understand\nor are familiar with\nthe fact that nutrition\nand our mental health interact\nin this very intimate, maybe\neven causal, way and that\nis something that occurs\nover long periods of time.\nMeaning, what I ate yesterday\nor the day before, maybe\neven 10 years ago, could\nbe impacting the way\nthat my brain and body\nare making me feel now.\nSo if you would, I'd love\nfor you to just tell us\nabout a little bit\nof the history,\nin particular, your\nhistory with exploring\nthe relationship between\nnutrition and mental health.\nAnd then we can dive into\nsome of the more particulars\nof ketogenic diets\nversus other diets,\nand some of the truly\nmiraculous findings\nthat you and others\nare coming up\nwith based on real patients\nand real experiences of people\nwho suffer and then find relief\nby altering their nutrition.\nCHRIS PALMER: Sure.\nThis story really starts\nwith my own personal story.\nAnd I don't need to\ngo into great detail.\nBut to set the stage,\nwhen I was a kid,\nI definitely had mental\nillness, started with OCD.\nA series of events\nhappened in my family.\nMy mother had a horrible\nkind of psychotic break,\nand all sorts of adverse\nchildhood events for me.\nShe and I were actually\nhomeless together for a while.\nI went on to have subsequent\ndepression, suicidality,\nall sorts of things.\nBut somehow or another, I\npulled myself together and got\nthrough medical\nschool-- actually\ndid quite well in\nmedical school,\ngot an award for being\none of the top students,\nand then was doing my internship\nand residency at Harvard.\nAnd at that point in\ntime, I was diagnosed\nwith metabolic syndrome.\nSo I had high blood\npressure, horrible lipids,\nand pre-diabetes.\nAnd I was doing everything\nright supposedly.\nI was on a low-fat diet, and\nI was exercising regularly.\nAnd year after\nyear, my doctor kept\ntelling me diet and exercise.\nI kept asking him, what diet?\nWhat exercise?\nI was doing everything\nhe kept telling me to do.\nEverything was getting worse.\nMy blood pressure\nkept going higher.\nAnd at some point,\nhe kind of said,\nyou're going to have\nto go on medication.\nI need to put you on something\nfor your pre-diabetes,\nsomething for your cholesterol,\nand something for your blood\npressure.\nSo three pills out of the gate.\nAnd I'm like, I'm\nonly in my 20s.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWere you overweight?\nCHRIS PALMER: No.\nTechnically, no.\nI had a gut, so that's a sign of\ninsulin resistance, I know now.\nI didn't know it then.\nAnd he actually kind of leaned\nin at one point and said,\ndo your parents have diabetes?\nYeah.\nDo your parents have\nhigh blood pressure?\nYeah.\nAre your parents overweight?\nYeah.\nOh, I'm really\nsorry, it's genetic.\nBasically, you're screwed.\nIt's your genes.\nYou're just going to have to\nbite the bullet and take meds.\nAnd as a physician, I\nknew what that meant.\nI knew that I'm in my\n20s, if I'm already\non three meds for\nmetabolic syndrome,\nI'm going to be screwed\nby the time I'm 40 or 50.\nAnd I'm probably going to\nbe having heart attacks.\nAnd I'd heard through\nthe rumor mill\nthat the Atkins\ndiet could somehow\nhelp people improve their\ncholesterol in pre-diabetes.\nI actually didn't\nreally believe it.\nI was highly skeptical.\nAnd I believed everything I\nwas taught in medical school.\nWhy would my\nprofessors lie to me?\nThey knew what they\nwere talking about.\nLow-fat diet was\nthe thing to do.\nAnd the Atkins diet was\nclearly dangerous and reckless.\nBut I had been trying the\nmedical dogma for years,\nand it wasn't working for me.\nAnd so for whatever\nreason, I decided\nthis is going to be my last\nattempt at something different.\nAnd then I'll just bite\nthe bullet and go on meds.\nSo I tried the Atkins diet.\nI did my own special\nversion of it.\nI still avoided red meat because\nI was terrified of red meat.\nI tried to do a healthy\nversion, which it's probably\nmore like the South Beach diet.\nThis was before the South\nBeach Diet was invented.\nBut within three months,\nmy metabolic syndrome\nwas completely gone.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So blood\npressure normalized,\nlipids normalized.\nDid your weight change?\nYou mentioned that you\nwere of healthy weight\nbut that you had a\nbit of abdominal--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat.\nCHRIS PALMER: I lost\nthe abdominal fat.\nI probably lost about 10\npounds through this process.\nBut everything got normal.\nAnd when I went back to\nmy doctor, he was shocked.\nHe actually said, what\nthe hell are you doing?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nDuring the time before\nyou switched to this new diet,\nhow was your mental health,\nif you don't mind me asking?\nBecause it sound like\nyou're very clear that there\nwas metabolic\nsyndrome or you were\nheaded towards more\nsevere metabolic syndrome.\nYou mentioned OCD.\nI actually am\nfamiliar with this.\nAs a kid, I had a low level\nkind of Tourette's grunt.\nAnd probably me, obsessive\nstill to some extent--\nalthough not full-blown\nclinically diagnosed OCD,\nso I can relate somewhat.\nIf you're willing,\nwhat was the context\nof all that before and after\nthis nutritional switch?\nCHRIS PALMER: So before\nthe nutritional switch,\nI was still struggling with\nlow grade depression and OCD.\nAgain, it wasn't\nnecessarily interfering\nwith my ability to function\nbecause I was functioning\nat a high level.\nAnybody looking from the\noutside, you're a top student.\nYou just got into one of\nthe most competitive--\nactually, at that point, it was\nthe most competitive residency\nprogram in the country\nfor psychiatry.\nSo they would have looked\nat me and said, you're fine.\nBut I wasn't.\nI was actually on medications.\nI was trying\ndifferent medications,\ntrying to figure out\nhow to feel better,\nhow to stop obsessing so much,\nhow to not be so depressed.\nAnd I found that\nthose medications,\nthey actually came with\nmore side effects for me\nthan benefits.\nI was on Prozac for a long time.\nIt totally messed up my sleep.\nAnd then the\npsychiatrist was like,\nyou need pills to\nhelp you sleep now.\nAnd I'm-- I just--\nI'm like, that doesn't--\nthat's not really resonating\nvery well with me.\nAnd I'm now a psychiatrist.\nI'm in my psychiatry residency.\nAnd I'm thinking, you know what?\nThat's just not\nsitting well with me\nthat you're going to prescribe\nmore and more meds for all\nthe side effects\nthat you're causing.\nAnd yet at the same time,\nI wanted to feel better.\nAnd I was learning\nchemical imbalances.\nThis is what we do to get\nrid of depression and OCD.\nYou're supposed to\ntake your pills.\nAnd so I was taking my pills.\nI was in psychotherapy.\nI had been in psychotherapy\non and off for years.\nI had received much\nmore intensive treatment\nwhen I was younger.\nAnd that was essentially\nworthless for me.\nIt actually probably just caused\nharm at the end of the day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Psychoanalysis?\nCHRIS PALMER: Various\npsychotherapies-- not\npsychoanalysis per\nse, but some of them\nwere psychoanalytically-oriented\npsychotherapies.\nI was actually\nhospitalized at one point.\nI had been put on lithium\nand imipramine, which\nis a tricyclic antidepressant,\nand other things.\nAnd they were actually horrible.\nThey were horrible.\nThey did nothing\nbeneficial for me.\nI gave them a decent\namount of time to work.\nI really wanted to feel better.\nSo at the time that\nI tried this diet,\nI certainly wasn't\nimpaired in the same way.\nI wasn't struggling that much.\nBut I was-- still have\nthese low grade symptoms,\nwas trying to feel better.\nAnd the thing that was\nthe most striking to me,\nafter doing the diet\nfor three months,\nwas not the fact that my\nmetabolic syndrome was gone.\nThat was my goal, and it\nwas a seemingly miraculous\nachievement because I\ngot rid of everything\nwith one dietary change.\nBut the thing that I noticed\nwas dramatic improvement\nin my mood, energy,\nconcentration, and sleep.\nI-- for the first\ntime in my life,\nI started waking up\nbefore my alarm went off\nand feeling rested.\nThat never happened\nto me before.\nI was meticulous about\nplanning when my alarm went off\nand how many times I could\npush the snooze button in order\nto be on time for\nwherever I needed to be,\nwhether it was school or\nthe hospital or whatever.\nI had it.\nI had this good system.\nI was never late for anything.\nBut that was shocking to\nme, that I felt so good.\nAnd one of the things that I've\noften said to people, prior\nto the diet, I always felt\nlike there are two types\nof people in the world.\nThere are \"haves\"\nand \"have-nots.\"\nThere are these\nhappy, peppy people,\nwho just are so positive,\nand they've got energy.\nAnd they have the\nsaying, they like\nto work hard and play hard.\nAnd I always understood\nworking hard.\nI totally got that because\nI was a hard worker\nand I understood the\nvalue of hard work.\nAnd you got to do something\nuseful with yourself.\nBut I never understood who\nthe hell wants to play hard,\nlike who's got energy for that?\nAren't you tired\nfrom working so hard?\nHow on Earth do these\npeople have energy\nto go and play hard?\nAnd I assumed that\nthey were just part\nof the \"haves\" in the world.\nAnd they were just\nlucky and privileged.\nThey either had good\ngenetics or maybe they\nhad good childhoods\nor good parents\nor something-- something\nthat I didn't have.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nkids with genuine smiles\nin the yearbooks.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS]\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhereas, the rest--\nand by the way, I\nreally appreciate\nyou sharing some of\nyour personal story\nbecause I think it is\nvery important for people\nto hear and understand\nthat people like yourself,\nwho are extremely high\nfunctioning and accomplished,\nthat the road was--\nfrom everything I'm hearing\nand understanding-- very choppy\ninternally at times,\nand that you've overcome\na lot in order to get there.\nAnd also, have been\ngoing through what\nsounds like a very long\niterative process of trying\nto figure out what\nworks and what\ndoesn't work to finally\narrive at a solution,\nand then make that the\nbasis of much of the work\nthat you're doing\ntoday for other people.\nI think it's very important\nbecause I think many people\nshare with you this\nnotion that there\nare indeed two\ngroups-- a happy group\nand then fated-to-be\nunhappy group.\nAnd it speaks to the fact that--\nyour story, rather, speaks\nto the fact that what we see\nis not always what's going on\ninternally with people and that\nthis notion of there\njust being two groups--\nthe happy or the haves\nand the have-nots--\ncan't be the way that it\nworks, and there are probably\nmany more people\nsuffering than we realize,\nand that there is an\nimportant need for tools\nto overcome that suffering.\nSo I really just hear you.\nEven early in our\ndiscussion, I just\nwant to extend a genuine\nthanks because so much\nof what I hear from people\nis questions about health,\nand mental health,\nand physical health.\nBut that clearly\npoint to the fact\nthat many people are\nstruggling to varying degrees.\nAnd even the people who\nare in this category\nof great childhood and\nhappiness could do far better\nfor themselves and then\nalso for other people.\nSo thank you for that.\nI want to know.\nAt the point where you\nrealized that nutrition\ncan play a profound role\nin how you feel and operate\nin a large number\nof domains, you\nare still a student or a\nresident at that point?\nCHRIS PALMER: I was a resident.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: At\nthat point, did you\ndecide that you were\ngoing to explore\nthis in a professional context?\nCHRIS PALMER: Not yet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo what was the journey\nforward into the work\nthat you're doing now?\nCHRIS PALMER: So the\nnext step was that I just\nhad friends and\nfamily who saw me,\nsaw that I had\nimproved my health,\nsaw that I lost some\nweight pretty easily.\nIn particular, I remember\nmy sister and sister-in-law,\nthey got really pissed\nat me one Thanksgiving\nbecause I could resist all the\npumpkin pie, and apple pie,\nand everything else.\nThey were like, how the\nhell are you doing that?\nHow are you resisting\nall of this food?\nAnd I said, I don't\ncrave it anymore.\nI don't want it, I'm fine.\nI'm just-- I'm having\nturkey and green beans.\nAnd that's good enough for me.\nSo I got them to do the diet.\nAnd they too noticed dramatic\nimprovement in their moods,\nand energy, and sleep,\nand everything else.\nSo within a few years, the\nprimary thing I noticed\nis this powerful\nantidepressant effect.\nAnd now, I'm an\nattending physician.\nI've got all these patients\nin my clinical practice\nwith treatment resistant\nmental illness.\nI'm in a tertiary care hospital.\nSo I almost never get\nsomebody off the street\nwith their first\nepisode of depression.\nOut of the gate, as\npart of my career,\nI get treatment resistant\nmental disorders.\nSo I get people who've already\nbeen to 6-plus psychiatrists,\ntherapists.\nThey've usually tried dozens\nof different medications.\nThey've been in decades\nof psychotherapy.\nThey've often had\nECT and other things.\nAnd nothing's working.\nAnd I'm thinking,\nwell, we're kind\nof out of options for\nthese other people.\nAnd this diet is having this\nreally powerful antidepressant\neffect.\nI think I'm going to try it and\njust see if any of my patients\nare game to try it to see\nif it might help them.\nSure enough, it did.\nDidn't help everyone\nand not everybody\nwas interested\nand/or able to do it.\nBut some of the ones\nwho were able to do it\nended up having a remarkable and\npowerful antidepressant effect.\nOne woman actually became\nhypomanic within a month.\nAnd she had been\ndepressed pretty much\nnonstop for over five years--\nchronically depressed, suicidal,\nin and out of hospitals.\nAnd I saw her become hypomanic.\nAnd I'm thinking,\nwow, this really\nis a powerful\nantidepressant effect.\nThis is amazing.\nThis is like a medication but\nbetter because it actually\nis working for her.\nBut I laid low at that point\nbecause, at that point,\nwe didn't have many clinical\ntrials of the safety\nor efficacy of the Atkins\ndiet for even weight loss\nor diabetes, let alone\nany mental disorders.\nAnd so I really actually felt\nlike I'm on the fringe here.\nAnd this is not going to be\nmet with praise by anyone.\nSo I'm just going to lay low.\nI'm going to offer\nit to patients.\nAnd I went along that\nway up until 2016.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And may\nI just ask about the diet?\nWhen you say \"Atkins diet,\"\nso this is low to zero starch,\nso low carbohydrate diet,\ncertainly low sugar.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And was\nit traditional Atkins?\nWere you tailoring it to\nthe individual patient\ndepending on their\npsychiatric symptoms,\nwhether or not they were\noverweight or not overweight?\nI'm assuming you're\nnot a nutritionist,\nso how did you\nprescribe a nutrition\nplan for your patients?\nAnd what was involved\nin making sure\nthat they adhered\nto that, maybe even\nsome of the things\nyou observed in terms\nof who was more willing to\ntry this or not try this?\nAny observations\nor maybe even data?\nCHRIS PALMER: So early\non, I was winging it.\nAnd I was-- the\nfirst few patients,\nit was try this Atkins diet.\nI want to see ketosis, so\nI was going for ketones.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So they\nwere pricking their finger,\nand they were doing\na blood ketone test?\nCHRIS PALMER: I didn't know\nabout blood ketone monitors\nif they existed back then.\nSo I was-- we were\nusing urine strips.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which\nare not quite as accurate\nbut still useful as a general\nguide, from what I understand.\nCHRIS PALMER: True.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that right?\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nCHRIS PALMER: So I was strongly\nrecommending that patients\nachieve urinary ketosis.\nAnd the interesting thing\nis I noticed a pattern,\nthat when they were trying the\ndiet and not getting ketones,\nthey often did not get\na clinical benefit.\nIt was once they\ngot into ketosis\nthat I began to notice\nthe clinical benefit\nand the powerful\nantidepressant effect.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So probably\nany nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,\nthat elevated ketones in the\nurine to the point where you\nwould say, this\nperson is in ketosis--\nor they would say\nI'm in ketosis--\nthat was a step in\nthe right direction,\nindependent of exactly what\nthey were eating or not\neating to get there,\nincluding fasting?\nAt that time, probably,\nfasting wasn't as popular now.\nThanks to the incredible work--\nI think it's incredible, and\nhe is a former colleague.\nAnd I know there's a lot of\ncontroversy about fasting.\nBut I think, for many people,\nfasting is a powerful tool.\nFor others, it's\na less useful tool\n--of Satchin Panda and others.\nBut fasting certainly will\nlimit your carbohydrate intake\nand get you into ketosis.\nCorrect?\nCHRIS PALMER: It will.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you\nhave any patients fast\nor do intermittent fasting?\nCHRIS PALMER: I did.\nI had some patients who did what\nAtkins had called a fat fast,\nwhere they eat primarily fat.\nSo they either fast and/or\nthey eat primarily fats\nto try to get into\na state of ketosis.\nSo for some patients,\nit was actually\nquite easy to get into\nketosis, especially overweight\nand obese patients.\nThey have a lot of fat\nstores on their body\nand actually limiting\ncarbohydrates\nusually results in high\nlevels of ketosis for them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd they probably\nfeel better too, I\nimagine, because when\nwe limit our starch\nintake, we start\nto excrete a lot of water.\nPeople can get some\npretty quick weight loss\nthat even though it\nmay not be fat loss,\nmakes them feel literally\na little lighter\nand maybe a little\nmore energetic.\nIs that right?\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nAnd as the years went on,\nthe field was advancing,\nmore research was coming out.\nPeople were getting a\nlittle more sophisticated\nwith blood ketone monitoring,\nwith different versions\nof ketogenic diets.\nAnd I was evolving my practice.\nThe thing that completely\nupended everything\nthat I knew as a psychiatrist,\nthough, was when I helped\na patient in 2016 lose weight.\nSo this was a patient,\n33-year-old man\nwith schizoaffective disorder.\nHe had been my patient\nfor eight years now.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nCould you clarify\nfor people what\nschizoaffective disorder is?\nI'm not a clinician.\nBut as I recall, it's like a\nlow level of schizophrenia.\nSo there might be some\nauditory hallucinations.\nIf I met this\nperson, I might think\nthey're kind of different,\nquote unquote, \"weird.\"\nBut they would not\nseem necessarily\nscary to me and to\ntypically to other people.\nAnd I mean that with\nrespect, of course.\nBut oftentimes, people\nwith schizophrenia\ncan seem just like--\nyou don't even\nknow how to interact with\nthem because their world seems\nso altered because they have\nall these so-called positive\nsymptoms-- hallucinations,\nand they're\ntalking to people that no\none else can see, et cetera.\nIs that schizoaffective?\nCHRIS PALMER: So no.\nSo schizoaffective is the same\nas schizophrenia essentially.\nThe only difference\nis it's schizophrenia\nwith superimposed mood episodes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, so it's\nactually more severe than--\nCHRIS PALMER: It can be.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo I have it backwards.\nCHRIS PALMER: So\nschizoaffective disorder\nis essentially schizophrenia\nand plus some mood episodes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe\nI'm thinking of schizotypal?\nCHRIS PALMER: Schizotypal\nis the low grade,\nkind of mild paranoia, or\nkind of eccentric beliefs,\nand other things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nFolks out there, I have\nmy nomenclature backwards.\nSchizotypal is the,\nquote unquote, lower--\n\"low level\" schizophrenia\nor schizoid-like.\nSchizoaffective is\nas or more severe.\nCHRIS PALMER:\nFull-blown schizophrenia\nplus full-blown\nusually bipolarism.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And now,\nit's absolutely clear\nwho the clinician\nin the room is.\n[LAUGHTER]\nThank you for that reminder.\nCHRIS PALMER: No worries.\nSo this man had\nschizoaffective disorder.\nHe had daily auditory\nhallucinations.\nHe had paranoid delusions.\nHe could not go out in public\nwithout being terrified.\nHe was convinced that there\nwere these powerful families,\nthat they had technologies that\ncould control his thoughts.\nThey could broadcast his\nthoughts to other people.\nThey were trying to hurt him.\nThey had targeted\nhim for some reason.\nHe wasn't quite sure why.\nHe had some suspicions\nand beliefs about maybe\nwhen he did this bad thing when\nhe was 11 years old, that's why\nthey decided to target him.\nThis man was tormented by\nhis illness, tormented.\nIt ruined his life.\nHe had already tried 17\ndifferent medications,\nand none of them\nstopped his symptoms.\nBut they did cause him\nto gain a lot of weight.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: These\nmedications, as I recall,\nfor schizophrenia-- the\nclassical ones are dopamine\nreceptor blockers--\ncaused people to--\nhuge increases in prolactin.\nThat's why sometimes men--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --will\nget breast development.\nAnd they'll put on\na lot of weight.\nAnd they'll be catatonic--\nor movement disorders.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They\nmake you feel like--\nI have to imagine,\ngiven how good\nmost things that release\ndopamine make us feel,\nthat blocking dopamine\nreceptors with antipsychotics\nmakes people feel lousy.\nCHRIS PALMER: Horrible.\nAnd it's a huge challenge in our\nfield because a lot of patients\ndon't want to take them.\nAnd then you get\nthese rebound effects.\nIf patients are on them\nfor several months,\nand then they stop\nthem cold turkey,\nthey can get wildly\npsychotic and ill,\nend up aggressive or\nhospitalized or sometimes dead.\nSo that's him.\nHe weighs 340 pounds.\nAnd for whatever reason,\nhe gets it in his head,\nI'm never going to\nget a girlfriend\nif I don't lose some weight.\nHe also recognizes,\nI'm never going\nto get a girlfriend\nbecause I'm a loser.\nI'm schizophrenic.\nI live with my father.\nI have nothing going for me.\nBut I could at\nleast try to address\none of these awful, horrible\nthings about myself.\nAnd maybe I could\nlose some weight.\nSo he asked for my help.\nFor a variety of\nreasons, we ended up\ndeciding to try\nthe ketogenic diet.\nNow, at this point, I\nhave no anticipation\nthat the ketogenic diet\nis going to do anything\nfor his psychiatric\nsymptoms because this man\nhas schizoaffective disorder.\nThat's not depression.\nDepression is very different.\nThey're totally\ndifferent disorders.\nSo he decides to give it a try.\nWithin two weeks, not only\ndoes he start losing weight,\nbut I begin to notice this\ndramatic antidepressant effect.\nHe's making better eye contact.\nHe's smiling more.\nHe's talking a lot more.\nI'm thinking like,\nwhat's gotten into you?\nYou're coming to life.\nLike you're-- I've never\nheard you talk this much.\nI've never seen you so\nexcited or present or alive.\nI haven't changed\nhis meds at all.\nThe thing that\nupended everything\nthat I knew as a psychiatrist\nwas six to eight weeks in,\nhe spontaneously\nstarts reporting,\nyou know, those voices\nthat I hear all the time?\nThey're going away.\nAnd he says, you know how I\nalways thought that there were\nall these families who were\ncontrolling my thoughts\nand out to get me, and\nthey had targeted me?\nAnd I'm thinking, oh, yeah.\nWe've been talking about\nthat for eight years.\nWe can talk about that again.\nHe says, you know what?\nNow that I think about it,\nI don't think that's true.\nAnd now that I say it,\nit sounds kind of crazy.\nIt probably never was.\nI've probably had\nschizophrenia all along\nlike everybody's been\ntrying to tell me.\nAnd I think it's going away.\nThat man went on--\nhe's now lost 160 pounds\nand kept it off to this day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nCHRIS PALMER: He was\nable to do things\nhe had not been able to do\nsince the time of his diagnosis.\nHe was able to complete\na certificate program.\nHe's able to go out in\npublic and not be paranoid.\nHe performed improv in\nfront of a live audience.\nat?\nOne point, he was able to\nmove out of his father's home\nand live independently.\nAnd that completely blew\nmy mind as a psychiatrist.\nAnd I went on a\nscientific journey\nto understand what in\nthe hell just happened.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nis indeed mind-blowing.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nin Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3/K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3/K2.\nI have a couple of questions.\nFirst of all, did\nhe stay on any kind\nof antipsychotic or\nother medication?\nIf so, were the dosages\nadjusted, excuse me,\nwhile undergoing this\nremarkable transition?\nBecause as we know,\nit's not an either\nor medication or nutrition\nchanges, it can be both.\nAnd then the other question\nis one of adherence.\nI think about someone with\nschizoaffective disorder,\nwho's suffering from\nall the sorts of things\nthat you described.\nHow does somebody like that\norganize themselves in order\nto stay on a ketogenic diet?\nAnd I say this with all the\nseriousness in the world.\nI think there are\na lot of people\nwho do not have schizotypal\nor schizoaffective disorder\nwho have trouble, they claim,\nadhering to a ketogenic diet.\nIt's not the easiest diet.\nCertainly in its\nextreme form at first,\nit's not the easiest\ndiet to stick to.\nSo how did he do it?\nThat sounds like a\nremarkable individual.\nAnd I'd also like to just\nknow your general thoughts\nabout adherence to things when\npeople are back on their heels\nmentally.\nHow do they get motivated\nand stick to something?\nSo the questions were,\nmedication, yes or no?\nIf yes, dosage\nadjusted, yes or no.\nAnd if people are\nsuffering from depression\nor full-blown\npsychotic episodes,\nhow does one ensure that they\ncontinue to adhere to a diet?\nCHRIS PALMER: So in\nterms of medications,\nhe has remained on medication.\nSo early on, I wasn't\nadjusting anything.\nI was just in disbelief and\nshock that this was happening.\nI didn't know what was going on.\nOver the years, we\nhave slowly but surely\ntried to taper him off his meds.\nHe has been on meds for decades.\nHe started medications\nwhen he was a young child.\nHis brain is as\ndeveloped in response\nto all sorts of\npsychiatric medications.\nAnd it has not been easy\nto try to get him off.\nWe continue to try to\nget him off medication.\nAnd it's challenging\nand difficult.\nAnd I just want to say\nfor any listeners, it is--\ngetting off your meds is\nvery difficult and dangerous.\nAnd you need to do\nit with supervision,\nwith a mental health\nprofessional or a prescriber\nbecause it is dangerous.\nWhen people reduce\ntheir meds too much,\nthey can get wildly symptomatic.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that\ntrue for depression as well?\nCHRIS PALMER: It's true for\nany psychiatric medication.\nThe brain makes\nadaptations in response\nto psychiatric medications.\nAnd when you stop\nthem cold turkey--\nsome people are fine.\nBut I wouldn't\nrecommend finding out\nbecause I've seen patients--\nwhen they stop antidepressants,\nI've seen patients get\nflooredly depressed and suicidal\nwithin three months.\nI had one patient,\nalmost quit her job\nbecause she became convinced\nthat, well, my life sucks,\nand it's all because of my boss.\nAnd I know that she's just\na horrible human being.\nAnd she's abusing me.\nAnd I was like,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa.\nI think this is related\nto your medication change.\nWe got her back on her\nmeds, within three days,\nshe said, oh my god, I\ncan't believe that happened.\nI almost quit my job.\nAnd that would have been the\nmost illogical and irrational\ndecision I've ever\nmade in my entire life.\nBut somehow, it seemed so\nreal just several days ago.\nAnd now that I'm back\non this medication--\nand it doesn't mean\nthat she needs the meds.\nBut it doesn't mean\nthat he needs the meds.\nIt means that meds need to\nbe adjusted very safely,\nand cautiously, and gradually.\nSo that's the medication piece.\nThe adherence piece was not easy\nfor him and for other patients.\nIt is very rare that I have\na patient who I can say,\ndo the ketogenic diet.\nCome see me in 3 months, and\nlet me know how it was going.\nThat almost never happens.\nIt has happened, I\nthink, on two occasions.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But that is, if\nI understand correctly, what--\nperhaps not you-- but\nmany psychiatrists\ndo with medication.\nIt's, here's your prescription.\nLet's talk in--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --a\nmonth or three months.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's\na variable that is probably\nworth us exploring\na little bit here\nas the conversation continues.\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat frequent contact\nand making micro\nadjustments or macro\nadjustments to medication or\nnutrition, could be meaningful.\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nSo with this particular\npatient, early on, he\nwas actually pretty adherent.\nI was seeing him once a week.\nAnd so I could do\na lot of education.\nI was weighing him.\nI was checking his ketones.\nI was checking his\nglucose levels.\nAt that point, I had a blood\nketone monitor in my office.\nSo I knew whether he\nwas compliant or not,\nwhich is so beneficial\nin doing clinical work\nand research on this diet.\nIt's the only diet\nwhere within seconds, I\ncan have an objective biomarker\nof compliance or noncompliance.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Such\na key point and again,\nbrings to mind, for me, the\nparallel with medication.\nA patient can say they're\ntaking their medication,\nand unless they're in\na hospital setting,\nwhere somebody's checking under\ntheir tongue and all of this,\nthey very well could not be\ntaking it or taking more.\nAnd you and I both\nknow that blood\ndraws for neurotransmitter\nlevels are complicated\nbecause you want to\nknow what's in the brain\nand what's functional\nin the brain.\nAnd then we have to imagine that\nmost people there prescribed\ndrugs for any number of\ndifferent psychiatric\nconditions are not giving\nblood every time they\ntalk to their psychiatrist\nor psychologist.\nNo?\nCHRIS PALMER: No.\nOn that front, when we've\nlooked at studies of compliance,\nthe majority of\npatients are at least\nsomewhat noncompliant with\nprescription medications.\nIt's not on purpose.\nThey forgot.\nThey take it at night.\nThey were out late.\nThey were off their routine.\nThey forgot to\nbrush their teeth--\nbecause that's when\nthey take their meds.\nAnd so because it was\nso late, they just\ncrashed when they got home.\nThey forgot to take their meds.\nHappens all the time.\nIf it's a medication that people\ntake more than once a day,\nthe noncompliance rates are\nmuch higher because it's just\neasy to forget.\nSo it's not that people\nare willfully disobeying\ntheir doctors or anything else.\nIt's just hard to remember\nto take meds consistently\nevery day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When you\nsay measuring ketones,\nI want to drill into\nthis a little bit\nbecause it does seem that\nthe presence of ketones\nand somebody being, quote\nunquote, \"in ketosis,\"\nit turns out to be\nthe key variable.\nCertainly, in your book, that's\none of the major takeaways--\nalthough there were many\nimportant takeaways--\nthat people get into ketosis.\nDo they have to stay in ketosis?\nSo for instance,\nI've followed the--\nI don't any longer.\nBut I've tried, in the past,\nthe so-called cyclic ketogenic\ndiet, where every third\nor fourth day, get\nsome pasta, or rice, et cetera.\nThat was interesting\nas an experiment.\nBut to stay in ketosis, what\nsort of blood levels of ketones\ndo you like to see\nin your patients?\nWhat is the range that you think\nmost people could aspire to?\nCHRIS PALMER: So it really\ndepends on the patient\nand what I'm treating,\nquite honestly.\nAnd I don't think every patient\nneeds the ketogenic diet.\nFor some patients, simply\ngetting rid of junk food\ncan make a huge difference in\na mood disorder, for instance.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So a junk food,\nmeaning, highly processed food,\nfood that could last on\nthe shelf a very long time.\nCHRIS PALMER: Highly\nprocessed foods\nthat are usually high in\nboth sugar, carbohydrate,\nand carbs, and fats.\nThose seem to be\nthe worst foods.\nThat combination--\nhigh sugar, high fat--\nseems to be the\nworst combination\nfor metabolic health.\nAnd lo and behold, we've got\nemerging data that suggests,\nthat strongly suggests, it's\nalso bad for mental health.\nDepression and anxiety are the\nmost common mental disorders.\nAnd so we have the best\ndata for those disorders.\nBut we actually have a lot of\ndata with even bipolar disorder\nand schizophrenia that insulin\nresistance, in particular,\nand insulin signaling\nin the brain\nis impaired in people with\nchronic mental disorders\nkind of across the board--\nall the way from chronic\nanxiety, depression,\nto bipolar, to schizophrenia,\nand even Alzheimer's disease.\nWe know that patients with\nall of those disorders\nhave impaired glucose metabolism\nand that the insulin signaling\nsystem in the brain, which\nis different than insulin\nsignaling in the\nperiphery, seems to somehow\npossibly be playing a role.\nSo to step back from that,\nso for some patients,\nI might just want to decrease\nglucose and insulin levels.\nAnd I can do that by\ngetting rid of sweets.\nFor other patients,\nlike patients\nwith schizoaffective disorder\nor schizophrenia or bipolar\ndisorder, especially\nif it's chronic,\nif I'm using it as\na brain treatment,\nthen I do want a ketogenic diet.\nAnd I usually want reasonably\nhigh levels of blood ketones.\nUsually, for depression, I\nwant to see at least greater\nthan probably 0.8 minimal.\nFor psychotic disorders\nand bipolar disorder,\nI usually want to see\nlevels greater than 1.5.\nThat's what I'm shooting\nfor, if at all possible.\nSo yeah, I think\nthat's what I'd go for.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--\nand sorry, I didn't\nmean to imply\nthat people need to\nbe in ketosis in order\nto see some mental health\nbenefits from changing\ntheir diet.\nYou make very clear\nin your book--\nand we'll go into\nthis in more detail--\nthat avoiding\ninsulin resistance,\nreversing insulin resistance,\nand essentially trying\nto reverse what\nearlier you described\nas this metabolic\nsyndrome, which\nis a bunch of different\nthings, is the target.\nAnd for some people, getting\nrid of highly processed foods\nand focusing mainly on\nnonprocessed or minimally\nprocessed foods\nwill really help.\nFor others, going straight to\nthe full-blown ketogenic diet\nwill be of most benefit.\nI'd like to back up a\nlittle bit in history\nand get to something which I\nfind incredibly interesting,\nwhich is epilepsy and\nthe longstanding use\nof ketogenic diet and\nfasting to treat epilepsy.\nAnd the reason I want to kind of\nrewind to that point in history\nis that, I think that for a\nlot of listeners and people\nout there who are familiar\nwith how changing your diet\nor changing your\nexercise can positively\nimpact sleep and weight\nand all these things,\nand it cascades into\nfeeling better--\nthat makes perfect sense.\nBut for a lot of\nthe world still,\nthe idea that changing or using\nnutrition as a dissection tool\nor as a treatment tool\nto understand and treat\nmental illness, is still\na kind of heretical idea,\nthat to them, it\nkind of falls in the,\nOK, well, that's like a woo\nscience or something like that.\nNow, obviously you're a\nboard-certified physician\nor psychiatrist at arguably one\nof the finest medical schools\nin the world, Harvard\nMedical School.\nEven though I'm on the\nStanford side, we acknowledge--\nwe acknowledge our East Coast--\nCHRIS PALMER:\nYou're the Harvard--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --friends.\nCHRIS PALMER: --of\nthe West Coast.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We're\nnot going to talk--\nOK.\nCHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We're\nnot going to talk--\nCHRIS PALMER: Or we're the\nStanford of the East Coast.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That argument\ncould go back and forth\na number of times.\nYou're a serious clinician\nand a serious scientist.\nAnd you're a serious thinker.\nBut for a lot of\npeople out there,\nthe notion of using\ndiet, they immediately\nthink, ah, well, that\nmakes perfect sense.\nOr I think there's a category\nof people who think, well, yeah,\ndidn't Atkins die\nof a heart attack?\nI hear that a lot.\nThat was crazy.\nPeople immediately\ndiscard the Atkins diet\nfor that reason, which I do\nthink is throwing the baby out\nwith the bathwater.\nBut it's an interesting\nthing nonetheless.\nAnd then I think that\nthe majority of people\nsit in the middle\nand just want to see\nscience and medicine come up\nwith treatments that work.\nAnd I have to say, I'm very\nrelieved to hear what you said\nearlier, which was-- you never\nsaid that people should come\noff their medication\nand just become--\ngo on a ketogenic diet and\neverything will be cured.\nYou're certainly\nnot saying that.\nCHRIS PALMER: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd rather you're\nsaying, if I\nunderstand correctly,\nthat nutrition needs\nto be considered\none of the major tools in the\nlandscape of effective tools\nand that it can\nbe very effective,\nevidenced by the\nstory that you shared.\nAnd there are many\nother stories in there\nas well of truly\nmiraculous transformations.\nSo let's talk about epilepsy and\nhow the ketogenic diet is not\njust used for\nepilepsy but is one\nof the oldest, if not\nthe oldest, examples\nof the use of nutrition\nto treat a condition\nof the nervous system\nthat can be incredibly\ndebilitating, even deadly.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah.\nAnd the reality is\nthat this literature,\nand this clinical history, and\nall of the research we have\nwas the godsend that I needed\nto do the work that I'm doing.\nOtherwise, I would have\nbeen discredited on day one.\nChris Palmer is claiming\nthat a dietary change\ncan influence schizophrenia\nor schizoaffective disorder.\nThat's impossible.\nAnd he's a quack.\nBut the thing that immediately\ngot me credibility was I\ndidn't focus on it as a diet.\nI did a deep dive into\nthe epilepsy literature.\nSo the ketogenic diet,\nunbeknownst to most people,\nwas actually developed a\nhundred years ago, 1921,\nby a physician for one\nand only one purpose--\nto treat epilepsy.\nIt wasn't developed\nas a weight loss diet.\nIt wasn't developed as the diet\nthat all human beings should\nfollow.\nAnd the reason it\nwas developed is\nbecause of this\nlongstanding observation,\nsince the time of Hippocrates,\nthat fasting can stop seizures.\nNow, fasting is\nnot a healthy diet.\nFasting is the\nprocess of no diet.\nSo we now understand a\ntremendous amount of science.\nMost people think going\nwithout food is bad.\nAnd they equate it\nwith starvation.\nBut in fact, when\nwe go without food,\nit causes tremendous\nshifts in metabolism--\nboth brain and body metabolism.\nAnd it puts the body into a mode\nof autophagy, and conservation\nof resources, and all\nsorts of things that\nare beneficial to human health.\nAnd this is why\nfasting has been used\nas a therapeutic intervention\nin almost every culture,\nin almost every religion\nfor a millennia.\nBut for the most\npart, that was all\nthought to be\nreligious folklore.\nThat was just crazy talk.\nAnd those stupid people\nway back then thought\nGod cured everything.\nAnd so they fasted.\nAnd they just assumed that\nthey were getting better.\nWell, in 1921, one physician\nused intermittent fasting\non a child with seizures and\nfound that, oh, Lo and behold,\nthis religious folklore\nstuff has something to it.\nIt actually worked.\nThe problem with\nfasting is that you\ncan only fast for so long\nbefore you starve to death.\nAnd that's not a very\neffective treatment.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And this child\nwas ingesting water, correct?\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It was just\nfood elimination fasting.\nCHRIS PALMER: Food elimination.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nCHRIS PALMER: So\nno special diet.\nBut the problem with\nfasting for epilepsy\nis that as soon as people start\neating a normal diet again,\ntheir seizures usually\ncome right back--\noftentimes, with a vengeance.\nAnd so it can be a good\nshort-term intervention.\nThe fasting can take a\nfew days because it can\ntake a few days to get ketosis.\nAnd then you can get some\nrelief from chronic seizures.\nBut it's not a good\nlong-term treatment\nbecause, again, people\nwill starve to death.\nAs soon as they start\neating, seizures come back.\nSo it was actually Dr. Russell\nWilder at the Mayo Clinic\nwho developed the ketogenic diet\nwith one and only one purpose.\nHe wanted to see, can we\nmimic the fasting state, using\nthis special diet, to see if it\nmight stop seizures long-term?\nAnd lo and behold, it worked.\nEarly results were\nextraordinarily positive.\n50% of patients who\nuse the ketogenic diet\nbecame seizure-free.\nAnd another 35% had a\n50% or greater reduction\nin their seizure frequency,\nso about 85% efficacy rate.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSorry to interrupt.\nI didn't mean to do that there.\nWas it just for\npediatric epilepsy\nor for adult epilepsy as well?\nCHRIS PALMER: So\nback in the 1920s,\nwe didn't have many\nanti-epilepsy treatments.\nAnd a lot of adults\nwere struggling as well.\nSo they were using it on\nanybody who would do the diet.\nBy the 1950s, pharmaceuticals\nwere coming out.\nAnd we had many more\nanticonvulsant treatments.\nAnd there's no question, they\nwork for a lot of people.\nThat's great.\nAnd taking a pill is so much\neasier than doing this diet.\nSo the diet pretty\nmuch fell out of favor.\nAnd nobody was using it from\nthe 1950s to about the '70s.\nBut lo and behold, even to\nthis day, people with epilepsy,\nabout 30% don't respond\nto the current treatments\nthat we have available.\n30% will have treatment\nresistant epilepsy,\nwhich means they\ncontinue to have seizures\nno matter how many\nanticonvulsants they're taking,\neven if they've\nhad brain surgery.\nIt just doesn't\nstop their seizures.\nAnd so in the 1970s,\nthe ketogenic diet\nwas resurrected at Johns Hopkins\nfor these treatment-resistant\ncases.\nAnd lo and behold, it works--\nnot for all of them,\nbut it works in--\nabout 1/3 become seizure-free.\nAnd these are people who've\ntried everything and nothing's\nworking.\nSo 1/3 become seizure-free.\nAnother third get\na clinical benefit,\nmeaning a 50% or greater\nreduction in their seizure\nfrequency.\nAnd the other third, it\ndoesn't seem to work.\nIt's not always clear if\nthat's because of noncompliance\nor if that's because the\ndiet's just not working.\nBut about a third,\na third, a third--\nseizure freedom,\nreduction in seizures,\nor it just doesn't work.\nAnd so the reality,\nthe godsend for me\nis that we have decades\nof neuroscience research\non the ketogenic diet and\nwhat it is doing to the brain.\nWe know that the ketogenic diet\nis influencing neurotransmitter\nlevels-- in particular,\nglutamate, GABA, adenosine.\nIt changes calcium channel\nregulation and calcium\nlevels, which is really\nimportant in the function\nof cells.\nIt changes gene expression.\nIt reduces brain inflammation.\nIt changes the gut microbiome.\nGut microbiome is a\nhuge topic right now.\nAnd there are some\nresearchers who\nargue that is the primary\nbenefit of the ketogenic diet--\nit's changing the gut\nmicrobiome in beneficial ways.\nSo it's doing a lot of things.\nIt obviously improves\ninsulin resistance.\nIt lowers glucose levels,\nlowers insulin levels,\nwhich improves\ninsulin signaling.\nThe key for my research that\nI've outlined, the real magic,\nis that this diet stimulates\ntwo processes that\nrelate to mitochondria.\nIt stimulates a process\ncalled mitophagy,\nwhich is getting rid of old\nand defective mitochondria,\nand replacing them\nwith new ones.\nAnd it also stimulates\na process called\nmitochondrial\nbiogenesis, which means\nthat after people have done the\nketogenic diet for a while--\nmonths or years-- many of\ntheir cells in their bodies\nand brains will have\nmore mitochondria.\nAnd those mitochondria\nwill be healthier.\nAnd I believe that is the reason\nthe ketogenic diet is such\na powerful treatment not\nonly for epilepsy but also\nfor people with chronic\nmental disorders.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Would\nyou mind listing off\na few of the mental disorders?\nAnd I know this is not\nmeant to be inside ball,\nbut we should distinguish\nbetween psychiatric disorders\nand neurological\nsymptoms and diseases.\nThe fields of\npsychiatry and neurology\nhopefully someday\nwill just emerge.\nBut for instance,\ntypically if somebody\nis presenting with\nsomething that\nlooks like\nAlzheimer's, dementia,\nthey'll talk to a neurologist.\nWhereas, if somebody is\npresenting with symptoms,\nlike schizophrenia, bipolar,\nthey'll talk to a psychiatrist.\nBut if you wouldn't\nmind wearing a dual hat,\ncould you just\nquickly list off some\nof the neurologic and\npsychiatric disorders\nfor which ketogenic--\nor let's just say--\nnutrition changes\nhave been shown to improve\nsymptoms significantly.\nAnd then maybe we can dive\ninto a couple of these\nas well as get more deeply\ninto these two very interesting\naspects of mitochondrial\nfunction and repair\nand turnover.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah.\nIn terms of nutritional\npsychiatry, it's a broad field.\nAnd it's in its infancy,\nis the real answer.\nIf you're looking for randomized\ncontrolled trials documenting\nefficacy in large numbers of\npatients with these disorders,\nwe don't have them.\nThey're underway now.\nBut we don't have them yet.\nWhat we do have\nare case studies.\nWe have a lot of\nmechanistic science papers\nby some of the leading\nneuroscientists\nand psychiatrists in the world--\nand neurologists in the\nworld kind of outlining,\nthis is everything we know that\nthe ketogenic diet is doing.\nThese are the\nproblems in the brains\nof people with these chronic\nmental or neurological\ndisorders.\nSo we know that\nthey should work.\nBut the disorders range\nfrom chronic depression to--\nwe've got a trial\nunderway for PTSD.\nWe've got one\nactually decent pilot\ntrial from the\nNational Institutes\nof Health for the ketogenic\ndiet for alcohol use disorder,\nof all things.\nAnd we can go into\nthat a little more.\nWe've got a couple of pilot\ntrials of the ketogenic diet\nfor Alzheimer's disease.\nAnd those are randomized\ncontrolled trials.\nWe've got case studies\nof the ketogenic diet\nfor chronic depression, bipolar\ndisorder, and schizophrenia.\nThe largest study that we've\ngot in that mental health sphere\nis a pilot study of 31 patients\nadmitted to a French hospital.\n28 of those patients\nwere able to do the diet\nand stay on the diet.\nSo 10%, off the\nbat, noncompliant,\ncouldn't do the diet.\nSo we need to include that.\nBut of the 28 patients\nwho were able to do--\nand these are 28 patients with\ntreatment-resistant mental\ndisorders, chronic depression,\nbipolar, and schizophrenia.\nOf the patients who were able\nto do the ketogenic diet,\n100% had at least some\nimprovement in symptoms.\n46% had remission of illness.\nRemission of illness,\nthat does not\nhappen with current treatments.\nAnd 64%, I think, were\ndischarged on less medicine\nthan they went into\nthe hospital on.\nSo it wasn't that the people\nwere prescribing more medicine\nand that's why.\nThey were being discharged\non less medication.\nWe've got at least--\nagain, a lot of the hard core\nscientists are going to say,\nshow us the randomized\ncontrolled trial\nwith hundreds of patients.\nAnd we've got five randomized\ncontrolled trials underway now,\nfunded primarily\nthrough philanthropy.\nI can tell you that--\nwe've talked about\nthat one index patient.\nBut at this point, I have now\ntreated dozens of patients.\nAnd I've heard from\nhundreds of patients\nwho've been treated by other\nclinicians, researchers--\nor I've just heard from\npatients from around the world--\nwho have shared stories\nof complete remission\nof long, chronic\nmental disorders--\nlike bipolar disorder\nand schizophrenia--\noff of psychiatric meds.\nSome of them-- not all\nof them, but some of them\nare able to get off\nall psychiatric meds\nand remain in remission.\nAgain, I think I\ndidn't say this before.\nBut it's really\nimportant to mention.\nFor people who\nmight be unfamiliar\nwith the mental health field and\nits connection with epilepsy,\nthe reason that it's such\nan important connection\nis that we use\nepilepsy treatments\nin psychiatric patients\nevery day in tens of millions\nof people.\nSo a lot of people\ndon't know this,\nbut I'll list off some names\nthat a lot of your listeners\nmay have heard of.\nAnd they probably know\nthem as psychiatric drugs.\nBut in fact, these\nare epilepsy drugs.\nDepakote, Tegretol,\nLamictal, Topamax, Neurontin\nor gabapentin, Valium,\nKlonopin, Xanax--\nthose are all medications\nthat stop seizures.\nAnd many of them were developed\ninitially for seizures.\nBut we, in the\nmental health field,\nquickly steal them and start\nusing them in tens of millions\nof people, even if\nthey're off label.\nSo that means, we don't have\nresearch studies documenting\nthat they're effective.\nBut we go ahead\nand use them anyway\nbecause the reality is far too\nmany patients aren't getting\nbetter with the\nFDA-approved treatments\nthat we do have to offer.\nSo psychiatrists are just\nwinging it in some cases.\nAnd we're just throwing\nwhatever we can at them\nand we absolutely include\nepilepsy treatments.\nSo in many ways, using\nthe ketogenic diet\nas a treatment for\nserious mental disorders,\nis nothing new at all.\nIt's an established\nevidence-based treatment\nfor epilepsy.\nWe use evidence-based\ntreatments for epilepsy\nacross the board for a wide\nrange of mental disorders.\nAnd so in many\nways, that's all I'm\ndoing with the ketogenic diet.\nIt just happens to be a diet.\n[CHUCKLES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nI love it.\nAnd I should say, I\nlove it because we\nhad a guest on here early\ndays of the podcast.\nHe's a colleague of\nmine at Stanford.\nHe's a bioengineer, and a\npsychiatrist, phenomenal\nscientist and\npsychiatrist, called\nDeisseroth, who won the Lasker\nprize, and so on and so forth.\nAnd he made a really\nimportant point,\nwhich should have\nbeen obvious to me\nbut wasn't until\nhe said it, which\nwas the psychiatrist has tools,\njust like the surgeon has\ntools.\nBut the tools are language\nand observing behavior.\nThose are the dissection\ntools for what's\ngoing on in someone's brain.\nAnd then as a\nneuroscientist, I'm\nfamiliar with the\nneurotransmitters\nand neuromodulators.\nAnd you mentioned that--\nand there are these tools of\naltering brain chemistry, which\nare of the sorts of\ndrugs you just listed\noff, or antidepressants,\nor antipsychotics,\nthat fall into these\nmajor bins of adjusting\ndopamine or adjusting\nserotonin or some combination\nof dopamine, serotonin\nepinephrine, adenosine,\nand on, and on, and on.\nAnd it seems to me, it's\nan incredible field.\nBut that the field is still\nvery much in its infancy\nthat it wasn't about a hundred\nyears ago that people were\nmeasuring bumps on the head as\na way to diagnose phrenology,\nand that there's still\nso much to learn.\nAnd so when I hear you say,\nadjusting nutrition or putting\npeople into a ketogenic state\nor even just eliminating\nhighly processed foods,\nsugars, et cetera,\ntaking care of\nmetabolic syndrome,\nand then observing\ntremendous relief\nin clinical syndromes of--\nor symptoms, rather, of\npsychiatric disorders,\nit makes perfect sense to me.\nIt's yet another\ndissection tool.\nAnd a tool for altering\nbrain chemistry.\nIf I think about the landscape,\nthe sort of sociology out there\nof--\nagain, there seem to be these\nbins, like a third of people\nsaying, of course,\ndiet, and exercise,\nand social connection,\nand limiting\nstress, that's the good stuff.\nThat's the stuff\nthat we really works.\nAnd then about a third of\npeople are sort of unclear.\nAnd then a third of\npeople think, well,\nif it's not a\nprescription drug, then\nit just has no\nplace in medicine.\nAnd hopefully, that's changing.\nAnd certainly, the\nwork that you're doing\nis going to be important\nin that transition\nthat I think we will see.\nI'd like to talk about mitophagy\nand mitochondrial biogenesis.\nI think most people learn that\nthe mitochondria are the energy\nfactories of cells and\nthat indeed, they are.\nAs a neuroscientist,\nwhat I know about\nthem is that they are present\neverywhere in neurons.\nNot just in the\nso-called cell body,\nbut you can find mitochondria\nin the furthest little bits\nof neurons.\nAnd neurons can be\nquite big, very large.\nIn fact, meters long or more\nin some cases and some species,\nincluding us.\nDepending on how tall somebody\nis, could be many meters--\nor several meters rather.\nAnd that mitochondria do a\nlot of stuff besides just\nproduce energy,\nbecause I think people\nhear \"mitochondria,\" \"energy,\"\nand they think, oh, so\nthese patients felt better.\nThey lost weight.\nThey had more energy.\nAnd then they're doing better.\nBut here we're talking\nabout remission\nof auditory hallucinations,\npeople feeling suicidal\nand then changing their\ndiet and feeling like life\nis something they can deal\nwith, and maybe even function\nextremely well, and et cetera.\nSo maybe we could just\ntalk about mitochondria\nfor a moment.\nAnd then talk about\nthese two major effects.\nWhat are some of\nthe other things\nthat mitochondria are important\nfor in neurons and maybe\nother cells of the brain?\nBecause as an access\npoint for all this,\nI think it would be great\nif people could learn\na little mitochondrial biology.\nCHRIS PALMER: So I guess the\nfirst thing that I'll say\nis that this field is one of\nthe most cutting-edge fields\nin medicine right now.\n20 years ago or so, I think the\nmajority of research scientists\nthought of\nmitochondria as nothing\nmore than little batteries.\nThey take food and oxygen\nand turn it into ATP.\nAnd that's really important.\nYeah, we get that.\nBut they're just\nlittle batteries.\nThat's all they are.\nAnd so one of the reasons\nthat this work is so important\nit's because it combines\ncutting-edge research\nin the metabolic field\nin the aging field.\nAnd we can start to pair\nit with a mental health\nand neurological health field.\nSo mitochondria-- one\nscientist gave me this analogy.\nHe said, if you think of\nthe cell as a computer,\na lot of people\nthink of mitochondria\nas the power cord\nto that computer\nbecause they're\nproviding the power.\nAnd they are, in fact, the\npower cord to that computer.\nBut actually,\ntheir real function\nis the motherboard\nof that computer.\nSo mitochondria are directing\nin allocating resources\nthroughout a cell.\nThat is their primary function.\nAnd then they happen to\nbe powerhouses as well.\nAnd so to give some\nclear examples,\nmitochondria play a direct role\nin the production, and release,\nand regulation of some\nreally key neurotransmitters,\nincluding serotonin, dopamine,\nglutamate, acetylcholine.\nThose are pretty powerful\nneurotransmitters.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nI would call those--\nI would consider those the--\nI know you listed\nmore than three.\nBut the sort of primary\ncolors of neurotransmission.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Any one of\nthose in excess or deficiency\nis going to have\nprofound negative effects\non a nervous system.\nOr it's going to alter the way\nthat people and animals feel,\nthink, move--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--remember, et cetera.\nCHRIS PALMER: So mitochondria\nare providing both some\nof the building\nblocks, if you will,\nfor some of those\nmolecules that are\npart of the Krebs,\ncitric acid cycle.\nSome of the\nintermediate products\nactually go into making\nthose neurotransmitters.\nMuch more importantly,\nmitochondria\nprovide the energy\nfor the production\nof those neurotransmitters.\nAnd fascinatingly, mitochondria\nare directly related\nto the release of\nneurotransmitters.\nATP alone is not enough.\nThere have been some research\nstudies that have actually\nfound that\nmitochondria move along\nthe membrane of the synapse\nto release batches of vesicles\nof neurotransmitters, and that\nif the mitochondria are removed\nfrom the synapse and researchers\nflood that cell with ATP,\nneurotransmitters usually\nare not getting released.\nMitochondria are\ndoing other things.\nWe don't entirely even\nunderstand what all they're\ndoing or how they're doing it.\nBut they're doing other things\nthan just providing the power.\nAnother really\nimportant example is\nthat mitochondria are actually\nthe primary regulators\nof epigenetics.\nIf you look at any one factor--\nso one study actually\nfound that they're\nresponsible for the\nexpression of about 60%\nof the genes in a cell.\nAnd mitochondria do\nthis through a lot\nof ways that have been known\nfor years and sometimes decades.\nSo mitochondria are\ndirectly related\nto the levels of reactive\noxygen species in a cell.\nThey are managing calcium\nregulation in cells.\nAnd we know that those\nthings play a role\nin epigenetic expression.\nWe know the levels of ATP to\nADP or AMP also play a role.\nAnd mitochondria are\ndoing those things.\nBut it turns out,\nmitochondria are actually\ndoing much more\nsophisticated things\nthan even those in terms\nof gene expression.\nMitochondria at\nleast play a role\nin all of the aspects of\nthe human stress response.\nSo when humans are\nstressed, either\nphysically or\npsychologically, there\nare several things that happen--\nincreased cortisol increased\nadrenaline, noradrenaline,\ninflammation, and gene\nexpression-- in particular,\nin the hippocampus-- occur\nwith the stress response.\nAnd one group of\nresearchers actually\ngenetically modified\nmitochondria\nin four different\nways, and found\nthat all of the stress\nresponse, all those four\nbuckets of stress response were\nimpacted in one way or another,\nimplying that\nmitochondria are somehow\nplaying a role in those.\nIn terms of their\nrole in cortisol,\nwe know that\nmitochondria actually\nhave the enzyme required for the\nsynthesis of steroid hormones.\nSo that includes cortisol,\nestrogen, testosterone,\nand progesterone, some\nnames that maybe everybody's\nheard of.\nso that means that\nif mitochondria\nare in short supply\nor dysfunctional,\nthe production of those hormones\nmay become dysregulated.\nMitochondria play a direct\nrole in inflammation.\nAnd they turn the\ninflammatory system both on--\nor they at least play a role in\nturning the inflammatory system\nboth on and off.\nI'm not going to be able\nto quote the exact study\nand author.\nBut one paper in cell actually\nidentified mitochondria\nas the key regulator in turning\ncertain inflammatory cells off,\nand that when you inhibit\nmitochondrial function,\nthose cells don't turn off,\nthat mitochondrial levels\nof reactive oxygen species\nare a key signaling process\nto turn the inflammatory\ncell process off.\nAnother study found\nthat macrophages--\nso macrophages are an\nimportant immune cell\nthat play a role in healing.\nSo if you cut yourself,\nyour body will get--\nsend inflammation that way\nand send immune cells that way\nto try to heal your skin.\nAnd macrophages play an\nimportant role in that healing.\nOne group of researchers\ntried to figure out\nhow do macrophages\nknow to switch\nbetween the different\nphases of wound healing\nbecause the macrophages\ndo different things\nin the different phases\nof wound healing.\nAnd the conclusion of\nall of their research\nwas that it's mitochondria.\nMitochondria are sending\nthe essential signals\nthat change the state\nof the macrophages\nto induce these different\nphases of wound healing.\nSo I've just talked about\nneurotransmitters, hormones,\nepigenetic expression,\ninflammation.\nFor anybody familiar with\nthe mental health field,\nthey know these are some of the\nkey variables that researchers\nhave been struggling with for\ndecades, trying to figure out\nhow do these fit together.\nWe know that all\nof those buckets\ncan be disrupted in people\nwith mental disorders.\nAnd our field has\nstruggled to understand,\nbut how do they fit together?\nHow can we make sense\nof this disruption?\nAnd I believe once\nyou understand\nthe science of mitochondria,\nyou can actually\nconnect all of the dots of\nthe mental illness puzzle.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand thank our sponsor,\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a lot of\nblood and DNA tests out there,\nhowever, is that\nyou get data back\nabout metabolic factors, lipids,\nand hormones, and so forth.\nBut you don't know what\nto do with those data.\nInsideTracker\nsolves that problem\nand makes it very easy\nfor you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation-based\ninterventions\nyou might want to\ntake on in order\nto adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors, hormones,\nlipids, and other\nthings that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health to bring\nthose numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate\nand indeed optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto

checkout.\nSuper interesting little\nsubcellular goodies,\nthese mitochondria are.\nI come from a field where\npeople are often divided\ninto lumpers and splitters.\nAnd I'm somewhere in between.\nFor those of you who\ndon't know, lumpers\nare people that like to\nmake things really simple--\nlists of no more than three\nfunctions or dividing brain\nareas into no more than three.\nSplitters are people\nthat like to subdivide\ninto a ton of detail.\nThere's a history of scientists\nbeing splitters in order\nto be able to name things\nafter themselves because--\nCHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's more territory\nto go around if you're splitting\nthan if you're lumping.\nBut we are doing neither here.\nWhat I'm hearing is that\nmitochondria, in addition\nto being important sources of\nenergy production and output\nin cells--\nwhich, of course, they are--\nprobably have other roles.\nMaybe someday, what we call\nmitochondria will actually\nbe two or three different little\nsubcellular or organelles.\nThere may be little\nbits in there\nthat are controlling gene\nexpression and little bits\nin there that are controlling\nneurotransmitter production.\nBut at least for now,\nthe name is mitochondria.\nAnd thank you, by the\nway, for illustrating\nsome of the other things\nthat they do because\nin the landscape of\nscience education,\noftentimes, people will\nthink, OK, energy production.\nThere'll be a picture or\na cartoon of mitochondria\nflexing its muscles.\nPeople go, OK,\nenergy, mitochondria,\nmighty mitochondria.\nAnd then they'll\nthink, oh, they're\njust sort of like a dumb\njock portion of the cell.\nThey're not doing\nanything sophisticated.\nAnd everything you\nlisted off is that they\nare doing many sophisticated\nintricate things within cells.\nSo I think how things are\ncartooned and discussed\nactually has an impact-- and\nnot just on the general public,\nbut on the medical field\nand on the science fields.\nAnyway, that's more\nscience sociology.\nBut now that everyone\nis well aware\nthat mitochondria are doing a\nlarge number of very important\nthings in a very regulated way,\nlet's talk about mitophagy.\nA few years ago, because a Nobel\nPrize was given for autophagy--\nsometimes called autophagy.\nLook, people, you can\nsay it either way.\nPeople will know hopefully what\nit means is more important,\nwhich is the gobbling\nup of one's own cells\nthat are dead or injured.\nAnd this idea of\nautophagy, of cells\nbeing eaten up within a system--\nnervous system or other system--\nhas come up again and again.\nI actually wasn't aware\nthat mitophagy could\nbe such an important lever.\nSo tell us about mitophagy,\nwhich I have to presume\nis the, intentional or not,\ngobbling up of mitochondria,\npresumably to replace them with\nnewer healthier mitochondria.\nIs that right?\nCHRIS PALMER: It is.\nSo in many ways, mitophagy\nis a subset of autophagy.\nBut it's got its\nown name because it\nis specific to mitochondria.\nThere do appear to be some\nunique regulators of mitophagy\ncompared to autophagy\nmore broadly.\nMitochondria actually are\nplaying a role in autophagy\nitself.\nAnd this makes sense because\none of-- so the global picture\nof autophagy is stimulated\nby fasting states\nor fasting-mimicking states.\nSo when your body senses that\nyou don't have enough food,\nit actually hunkers\ndown and starts\nto recycle dead old parts\nin this kind of carefully\norchestrated way.\nAnd it takes them to lysosomes.\nThey get degraded.\nAnd then those\ndegradation products\nget used for either energy\nor to build new things.\nAutophagy is always\noccurring at a low level.\nBut you can really\nhyperstimulate the process\nthrough fasting,\ncalorie restriction,\nfasting-mimicking\ndiets, other things.\nAnd this is why fasting\nand calorie restriction\nis so kind of such hot topics\nin the medical field now.\nIt's because they've been\nshown to induce longevity.\nAnd we think it's probably\nthrough that process\nthat you're stimulating\nthe body to kind of become\nlean and conservative in terms\nof its allocation of resources.\nAnd the body doesn't just\ndestroy the healthiest tissue\nalong with the old dead stuff.\nIt has these processes that\nidentify the old and defective\nparts first.\nAnd they go first.\nAnd that's what's beautiful\nabout the whole thing.\nAnd that's why fasting\nis so important.\nSo mitophagy we know plays a\nreally important role because--\nso there's this term called\nmitochondrial dysfunction,\nwhich some researchers are\nactually wanting to get rid of\nand move away from\nbecause, as you just said,\nmitochondria do so\nmany different things.\nAnd different mitochondria\neven within the same cell\nmay very well be specializing\nin different tasks.\nAnd mitochondria from\none cell to another\nare sometimes doing\nvery different things,\nlike not all mitochondria\ncan produce cortisol.\nThat's specific\nto specific cells\nwhere those genes are\ngetting turned on.\nSo it's not like\nall mitochondria\nare producing cortisol.\nJust the ones in your\nadrenal gland, for instance,\nare producing cortisol.\nBut there is this term\n\"mitochondrial dysfunction.\"\nAnd it has long been\nknown, for decades,\nthat mitochondrial dysfunction\nis associated with everything\nthat ails us essentially.\nSo in the 1950s, we\nhad a theory of aging\nthat was based on\nreactive oxygen species.\nAnd that's where all\nthe inflammation is bad\nfor you comes from.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And where all\nthe noise about antioxidants--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nLike in the '90s,\nit was like, it\ncontains antioxidants.\nNot to say antioxidants are\nbad, but they are certainly not\nthe be-all-end-all of health.\nCHRIS PALMER: They are not.\nBut that's exactly where\nthat research came from,\nis that researchers\nwere narrowing\nin on these reactive oxygen\nspecies are highly, highly\ncorrelated with all of\nthe diseases of aging\nand poor health outcomes.\nIt turns out, they're also\nhighly, highly correlated\nwith all chronic mental\ndisorders interestingly.\nSo researchers used\nthe antioxidants\nto see if, well,\nmaybe if we can stop,\nsomehow tame these\nreactive oxygen species,\nwe'll improve health outcomes.\nDoesn't seem to work.\nBy the 1970s, our\nunderstanding of mitochondria\nand their role in the production\nof reactive oxygen species\nexpanded.\nAnd that led to the\nmitochondrial theory of aging.\nSo in the 1970s, we had this\nmitochondrial theory of aging,\nbased primarily and exclusively\non reactive oxygen species.\nFast forward a\ncouple of decades,\nthat was disproven\nbecause we now reactive\noxygen species aren't all bad.\nThey actually serve\na signaling process.\nThey're a normal part\nof human functioning\nand cellular function.\nSo they're not all bad.\nBut we still know high levels\nof reactive oxygen species\nare bad for you.\nFast forward to just, I\nthink, maybe last year,\nwith this expanded role of\nall of the different things\nmitochondria are doing.\nSo David Sinclair\npublished a paper\nin one of the cell\njournals, I think,\nsaying that, oh,\nmitochondria are actually\nthe unifying link of everything\nthat we know about aging.\nMitochondria are the cause--\nor defective mitochondria\nor defective mitochondrial\nfunction, mitochondrial\ndysfunction,\nis possibly the\nunifying cause of aging\nand all of the aging\nrelated disorders.\nSo mitophagy is trying\nto address all that.\nIt's trying to say,\nOK, this is bad.\nWe don't want defective\nmitochondria and how can\nwe get rid of old\nones or defective ones\nand replace them with new ones.\nAnd I think the most\npowerful signal and tool\nthat we have right now is,\nin fact, related to diet.\nIt's calorie restriction.\nThat is the oldest, truest, kind\nof best-proven way to prevent\naging in a wide variety\nof animal species--\nfasting and\nintermittent fasting.\nAnd again, you can only do\nthose things for so long.\nAnd then fasting-mimicking\ndiets can also\nstimulate this\nprocess of mitophagy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we talk\nabout mitochondrial biogenesis,\nif--\nand I certainly accept\nthe idea that mitochondria\nare extremely important\nin physical health\nand mental health.\nThat's, for me, is a\nstraightforward conclusion\nat this point, based\non what you've said,\nwhatever and\nelsewhere, et cetera.\nAnd if various diets, including\nketogenic diet, including\nfasting, reducing sugar\nintake, et cetera,\ncan assist in mitochondrial\nfunction and mitophagy--\nand that's at least one of\nthe levers by which diet\ncan positively impact mental\nhealth and physical health,\ncan we conclude that\nthere's something special\nabout low blood\nglucose in the brain?\nThe sort of common pathway of\nall of those things-- fasting,\nketogenesis--\nfor some people, maybe they--\nmaybe some people have\ngreat insulin management,\nso just removing\nsweets, refined sugars,\nbrings down their blood\nglucose level substantially.\nThey don't need to go\non a ketogenic diet\nin order to relieve a\nlow level depression\nor something like that.\nSeems like the\ncommon theme here is\nthat glucose levels\nin the brain need\nto be reduced, which\nfor me, is surprising\nbecause neurons love glucose.\nThere are some\nreally nice studies.\nOne that I can think\nof recently that\nwas published in\nNeuron, if you just\nlook at the tuning of a neuron,\nhow well a neuron in the brain\nrepresents some visual image\nin the environment in terms--\nhere, we can just\ngeneralize and say,\nmore action potentials,\nmore electrical signals\nfrom the neuron\ngenerally correlates\nwith better high\nfidelity representation.\nIt's sort of if everyone's\ntime someone says, shout,\nand then someone\nshouts, the neuron\nis the one responding\nto the order.\nAnd these neurons just,\nwhen there's high glucose,\nthey are faithful\nrepresentatives\nof what's out\nthere in the world.\nBut then when you\nfast an animal,\nthey become less\nfaithful representatives\nof what's out there.\nAnd yet when I've done\nintermittent fasting,\nand I do a kind of\nmodified version of it,\nmy mental clarity is\nfar better than when\nI've had a big bowl of pasta--\nprobably for other\nreasons related\nto serotonin and tryptophan.\nSo I think for the typical\nlistener out there,\nI have to imagine, it's got\nto be a little confusing.\nWe hear neurons love glucose.\nThey live on glucose.\nAnd here, we're saying, let's\ndeprive them of some glucose.\nOr let's just bring\nglucose levels down.\nOr let's switch the fuel source\nof the brain from glucose\nto ketones.\nAnd now the brain really works\nthe way it's supposed to.\nSo this raises a little bit\nof just so story question,\nlike why would it be the case\nthat neurons love glucose,\nand yet if there's too\nmuch glucose around,\nthey become sick?\nAnd of course, with any\nwhy-would-it-be story,\nas I would say, I wasn't\nconsulted at the design phase.\nAnd I'm going to\npresume that you\nweren't consulted the design--\nCHRIS PALMER: I was not.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either.\nAnd that if any of\nus say that we are,\nthen we are probably the\npatients that need evaluation.\nSo I think there's\na name for that.\nThere's delusion--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --right?\nOK.\nI threw out my first correct\nclinical assessment of myself.\nSo how do I get my\nhead around this?\nYou've got me sold\non mitochondria--\nnot that I needed to be sold.\nBut that's an easy yes,\nyes, absolutely, yes.\nThe idea that diet can\nimpact mental health\nand physical health--\nyes, absolutely--\nby way of mitochondria--\nat least in part, great.\nBut then neurons love glucose.\nSo what's going on?\nOr what do you\nthink is going on?\nCHRIS PALMER: I am not convinced\nthat glucose is the real story.\nGlucose may, in\nfact, be a symptom.\nWe know that parts\nof the brain--\nthere have been a couple of\nstudies that just came out\nin the last couple\nof weeks, I think,\ndocumenting that actually\nastrocytes in the hypothalamus\nplay a key role in glucose\nregulation throughout the body.\nAnd it appears to be a metabolic\nrole, which in my mind,\nimplies that the mitochondria\nin those astrocytes\nare probably playing a key role\nbecause we know mitochondria\nplay a key role in\nsensing glucose levels.\nThey play a key role in\nthe release of insulin\nfrom the pancreas.\nBut mitochondria in\nthe brain is also\nplaying a role in\nkind of balancing\nhow much glucose is around.\nAnd so it's a difficult question\nbecause I think in some cases,\nhigh glucose levels\nare actually a symptom\nof metabolic dysfunction\nsomewhere in the body or brain.\nAnd when I think about,\nwell, what does that mean?\nIn my mind, most of\nthe evidence currently\nis pointing to\nmitochondrial dysfunction\nsomewhere in the body or brain.\nThat is the most likely\ncause of that dysregulation\nof glucose levels.\nBut we know that if you\nconsume massive amounts\nof junk food, sugar,\nand other things,\nthat you can get dysregulation\nof glucose levels.\nThe conundrum, though,\nis that that's not\na universal response.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And what\nabout the typical person?\nI've never really liked\njunk food that much.\nMaybe as a kid, I can\nrecall liking candy.\nBut I was a sandwich for\nlunch person for a long time.\nAnd as I've changed\nthat out for salad\nand maybe a small piece of\nmeat with my salad or something\nlike that, I feel far better\nduring the day, far more alert.\nBut I do eat carbohydrates.\nI eat starches\ntypically at night.\nBut I tend to do some very\nhard training at some point\nduring the day.\nSo I imagine I have\nsome glycogen to repack.\nOK.\nThat's me.\nI only mentioned that\nbecause I'm not in ketosis\nas far as I know.\nI haven't-- unless you\nbrought the strips,\nI haven't done the blood\nglucose test today.\nSo what about the\ntypical person who's\nan omnivore eating some\nrice, some pasta, pasta\nsalads, people that are eating\nnot junk food massive amounts\nof sugar but have\nblood glucose that's\nin kind of moderate range?\nDo you think-- and here,\nfeel free to speculate.\nDo you think that those\npeople might feel far better--\nor even a little\nbit better-- if they\nwere in a lower glucose state?\nAnd I ask this\nbecause I think there\nare a lot of people\nout there who suffer\nfrom full-blown depression.\nBut there are also\na lot of people\nwho suffer from moodiness\nand feeling not so great,\nsubclinical depression.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout\nis what I would call it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just\nfeeling some days are great,\nand then other days, they\nfeel lousy for reasons\nthey don't understand.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And those make\nfor less dramatic case studies.\nAnd yet I have to assume\nthat that description will\nnet a large fraction\nof the general public.\nCHRIS PALMER: So the way that\nI kind of break this field--\nand I'm probably getting\ntoo nerdy right now.\nBut I kind of break\nthis field into cause--\nwhat's the actual root cause--\nand what are\neffective treatments.\nAnd I really see them\nas two separate things.\nJust because the ketogenic\ndiet is an effective treatment,\ndoes not imply that the\ncause of the problem\nwas eating carbohydrates.\nAnd I think that's a really\nimportant distinction.\nThere are many people who\ndisagree with me on that.\nThere's no doubt about it.\nAnd everybody's\nheard people say,\nsugar is the cause of\neverything that ails you.\nOr carbs are the cause of\neverything that ails you.\nIf everybody does a low carb\ndiet or a ketogenic diet--\nand then they go to, so it must\nbe sugar that was the cause.\nI don't see it as clearly\nblack and white as that.\nCalorie restriction,\nketogenic diet,\ncarbohydrate restriction are\ninducing metabolic changes\nin the brain and body.\nAnd regardless of what\nthe person was eating,\nthey are inducing\nmetabolic changes\nthat can be really\nbeneficial to brain health.\nSo let me just give a clear\nblack and white example\nof this.\nAnd then I can speak\nto the broader topic\nthat you brought up about\njust the general population.\nThe easy example of\nthe ketogenic diet\nbeing an effective\nintervention for somebody\nwho was not following a bad\ndiet is an infant with epilepsy.\nThere are lots of infants who\nhave uncontrollable seizures.\nThey are drinking breast milk.\nTo the best of our\nknowledge, that\nis the primary, most\nbeneficial food source\nan infant could be consuming.\nNow, some might say, well,\nmaybe the mother is--\nwhatever, I don't buy that.\nThe mother's breast milk is, in\nfact, the optimal food source\nfor that infant.\nAnd yet that infant\nis still seizing.\nIf we put that infant\non a ketogenic diet,\na lot of those infants\nseizures will stop.\nIt doesn't mean that the\ncause of the infant seizures\nwas a bad diet.\nBut it means that\ndietary intervention\ncan change brain metabolism\nand improve symptoms\nin that person.\nSo going to your broader\nquestion about adults,\nmodern-day, the real\nanswer is-- there was just\nthis conference in\nLondon, the Royal\nCollege of obesity medicine\nor something like that.\nThat's not the name.\nBut it's something\nalong those lines.\nThe conclusion of\nthat conference\nthat invited the greatest\nminds in obesity medicine,\nthe overarching conclusion\nof that conference was we\ndon't know what causes obesity.\nIt's really important\nthat we sit with that.\nWe don't know what\ncauses obesity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey don't think\nexcess caloric intake beyond\none's daily metabolic needs\nis causing obesity?\nCHRIS PALMER: Some\nwill argue that.\nAnd so some will say yes,\nit's all energy balance.\nBut why do we have an\nepidemic of obesity?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.\nWell, that's the\nN-gazillion dollar question.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nSome will say, it's\nall the junk food.\nBut we had junk\nfood in the 1970s.\nWhen I was growing up, I grew\nup on Kool-Aid, and Twinkies,\nand King Dons, and HoHos, and--\n[LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm rewatching\nthe Mad Men series now.\nI love that series,\nand I'm rewatching it.\nAnd I happen to know someone\nwho worked on that series.\nThey researched\neverything for the props,\nand the costumes, everything,\nright down to diet.\nAnd if you look at the\ndiet, it was terrible.\nIt was mostly--\nyes, there was a lot\nof excessive amounts of\ndrinking and cigarette smoking.\nBut the diets were terrible.\nIt was pre-packaged foods.\nIt was frozen dinners.\nThat really came to prominence\nin the '70s and '80s.\nBut even in the '50s and, from\nwhat I've been reading, even\nin the '30s and\n'40s, people were not\neating grass-fed\nmeat and Brazil nuts\nwith a little bit of\nbroccoli rabe on the side.\nThat's not the typical intake.\nSo something out there--\nor maybe multiple things--\nare at play to increase obesity.\nCHRIS PALMER: And at the\nend of the day, I believe--\nsome will call this speculative.\nBut I actually think we've got\na tremendous amount of evidence\nthat continues to point\nin this direction.\nI believe that\nmitochondria are the key\nto the obesity\nepidemic, that there is\nsomething in our environment.\nSo that is either our food,\nenvironmental toxins, stress\nlevels, poor sleep, not getting\nadequate sunlight, whatever\nyou want to speculate on, all of\nthe above, all of those things\nare known to impair\nmitochondrial function.\nAnd if parts of your brain that\nregulate metabolism and that\nregulate eating behaviors are\nnot metabolically healthy,\nit means that they will\nnot stop you from eating.\nOr it means that your\nmetabolism will not\nrise to the challenge\nof 10 donuts,\nbecause some people\ncan eat 10 donuts\nand go on staying\nthin and healthy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI totally agree.\nAlthough, I would\njust like to say\nthat it seems to me that\ncompared to when I was growing\nup-- and again, I haven't\nrun the statistics--\nthere are fewer and fewer of\nthose individuals around now.\nJust as when I was growing up,\nit was one or two kids in class\nthat were quite overweight.\nAnd then there were some\nthat were mildly overweight.\nBut most were of healthy weight.\nNowadays, that's\ndramatically altered.\nThe landscape is dramatically\naltered in the other direction.\nIt is rare when I encounter one\nof those can-eat-anything type\npeople.\nI know one, he's actually\nan employee at Stanford.\nHe's in our media\nteam at Stanford.\nAnd this guy, when I take\nhim to lunch, it's like--\nhe's in his early\n70s, and he can eat.\nAnd he's incredibly lean.\nHe exercises a little bit.\nBut he's one of these mutants\nthat just can eat, and eat,\nand eat, and he's lean\nand he's vital, and he's--\nit's wild.\nAnd he's an expensive lunch.\nCHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But those\npeople are seem rare.\nAnd even those kids\nare now seem rare.\nCHRIS PALMER: They're\ngetting increasingly rare.\nAnd that leads me\nto think it may\nbe epigenetic factors\nin the womb environment,\nso that kids are actually coming\nout predisposed to obesity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nlet me ask you about\nthat because I had a note\nhere to ask this later.\nBut I'm going to\ninterrupt you now in order\nto capture this moment.\nMy understanding is that--\nwell, as everyone\nknows, we inherit DNA.\nWe get genes from\nboth of our parents.\nAnd they mix.\nAlthough there are incredible\ndata from Catherine Dulac's\nlab at Harvard and others\nshowing that we actually\nhave entire regions\nof our brain that\ncarry neurons that are of\npurely of mom's or of dad's DNA,\ndepending on the brain region.\nThis is a wild finding.\nBut it's accurate.\nAnd this has actually been known\nabout in terms of heritability\nof disease, et cetera.\nMaternal DNA, DNA from mom,\ngenes from our mother--\nnot to place blame\non mothers at all.\nMy understanding is that\nthe mitochondrial DNA\ncome exclusively through\nthe maternal side.\nIs that true?\nCHRIS PALMER: So it's\na great question.\nAnd I've been asked this before.\nAnd yeah, psychiatrists are\nknown for blaming mothers.\nAnd some might say that I'm\ntrying to redo that whole thing\nand blame mothers again.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\ndata are the data.\nI'm not trying to\nblame mothers here.\nMothers play an essential\nrole in everything.\nBut if it is true\nthat mitochondria\nare the linchpin of all this and\nmaternal DNA is what determines\nthe mitochondrial DNA, I\nthink it's an important place\nto look.\nCHRIS PALMER: It's an\nimportant question.\nAnd the answer is\nunequivocally no.\nThat's not the way it works.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nthen vindication for anyone\nthat was asserting that.\nCHRIS PALMER: And so\nlet me explain it.\nSo mitochondria have 36\ngenes unto themselves.\n13 of those genes code for some\nof the mitochondrial machinery\nof making ATP.\nAnd the other 36 play roles\nin epigenetic regulation,\nplay roles in whole body\nmetabolism, and other things.\nSo that is what you're\ninheriting from your mom.\nIt's the mitochondria and those\n36 genes for the most part.\nBut the majority of proteins\nthat make up mitochondria,\nover, I think, 1,300 genes\nthat make up mitochondria\nare actually encoded\nin the nuclear DNA.\nAnd so you inherit a copy\nfrom both your mother\nand your father.\nSo the majority of people who\nhave mitochondrial defects\nor rare mitochondrial\ndiseases actually\ncould inherit them\nfrom either mom or dad\nbecause it can be a defect in\nthe nuclear genes that code\nfor proteins that\nmake up mitochondria.\nThe much bigger issue when--\nso when I talk about\nmitochondrial dysfunction\nbeing a primary driver of mental\nillness, metabolic illness,\nit's not that people inherit\na defective mitochondrion\nor mitochondria\nfrom mom, and then\nthat just ruins\ntheir life forever.\nThat's actually not\nthe way it works.\nThe beautiful thing\nabout this theory\nis that it connects\nall of the risk factors\nthat we already know play\na role in mental health\nbut also metabolic health.\nSleep disruption impairs\nmitochondria and mitochondrial\nfunction.\nStress, high levels\nof stress and trauma,\nimpair mitochondrial function.\nDrug and alcohol use,\nalcohol, tobacco definitely--\nin terms of the smoke--\nand marijuana-- THC, in\nparticular-- all impair\nmitochondrial function.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: THC\ndirectly or the smoke?\nCHRIS PALMER: THC directly.\nThose studies have been done.\nSo mitochondria actually have\nCB1 receptors right on them.\nAnd various\nresearchers, a couple\nof studies from Nature\nactually documented\nthis, that the mitochondrial\nCB1 receptors are primary--\nkind of primary points of\nthe influence of marijuana\non human behaviors and effects.\nBecause when they remove CB1\nreceptors in animal models,\nthese changes don't happen.\nSo the CB1 receptors--\nwe've got some large\nstudies of adolescents\nwho use a lot of marijuana.\nAnd the areas where the\nmitochondria have the greatest\nnumber of CB1 receptors\nare areas of their brains\nthat actually are atrophied\nor shrunk compared\nto normal healthy controls.\nSo that means their brain\ntissue is aging prematurely.\nIt's shrinking prematurely.\nBut the CB1 receptors\non mitochondria\nalso seem to play a role in\nthe memory impairment that\ncan be induced from THC.\nAnd they also play\na role in the kind\nof lack of motivation, the\nbehavioral amotivational state\nfrom THC.\nNow, again, for people\nwho want to chillax,\nthat's what they're looking for.\nThey don't want to\nremember anything.\nThey don't want to think.\nThey want to be spaced out.\nThey want to relax.\nThat's great.\nBut it's important\nthat they know\nthat they're actually harming\nthe mitochondria in their brain\ncells.\nAnd that although there's\nalways an opportunity\nto repair mitochondria\nand always an opportunity\nto stimulate\nmitochondrial biogenesis,\nso you can get it back, but if\nyou keep doing it chronically,\nyou're probably not helping\nyour overall mental or metabolic\nhealth.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm\nglad you brought up THC.\nWe did an episode on cannabis.\nWe also did one on alcohol--\nprobably lost some\nfriends from that one.\nWhen you look at the\ndata, it's very clear.\nI'm not arguing\nthat people dislike\nthe effects of these\ncompounds when they take them.\nBut it is clear\nthat, at least to me,\nbased on the data that\nregardless of what people\nhave read about red wine, that\nnot drinking any alcohol is\ngoing to be healthier\nthan drinking alcohol,\nand that the thresholds for\nalcohol ingestion before people\nstart to negatively\nimpact their health\nis about one or two per week.\nAnd then THC, because of\nthe very high concentrations\nof THC that are present\nin a lot of products now--\nvaping and smoking\nTHC and even edibles--\nthat it can be problematic.\nYou mentioned adolescents\nthat predisposition,\nand brain atrophy,\npsychosis, et cetera.\nIn any case, because\nyou mentioned alcohol\nbecause it is a\ncommonly used substance,\nI heard you give\na talk in which--\nI think I have this right--\nin which alcohol can disrupt\nthe way that the brain\nuses fuels of all kinds,\nwhich may disrupt one's\nresponse to alcohol,\nmake alcohol seem more rewarding\nto those that drink alcohol.\nSo drinking alcohol\nmakes alcohol\nmore rewarding to the\nbrains of alcohol drinkers,\nbut that it also might\nalter glucose metabolism,\nthat basically alcohol is\nnot good for our brains.\nDo I have that correct?\nCHRIS PALMER: You do\nhave that correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nWhat happens if you take an\nalcoholic or somebody that just\ndrinks two to four\nnights a week a couple\nof drinks, which I think\nis pretty common out there,\nand you put them on\na ketogenic diet?\nHas that experiment been done?\nCHRIS PALMER: That\nexperiment has been done.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah.\nCHRIS PALMER: It\nled by none other\nthan a woman named\nNora Volkow, who\nis one of the leading\nneuroscientists and addiction\nresearchers in the world.\nShe is the director of\nthe National Institute\nof Drug Abuse.\nShe's been hot on the trail\nof metabolic abnormalities\nin the brains of people with\nalcohol use disorder, which\nI will just refer\nto as alcoholics\nbecause that's what\neverybody knows it as.\nSo she's been hot on this\ntrail for many, many years.\nAnd as you said, it turns\nout that the reward pathways,\nin particular, are metabolically\ncompromised in alcoholics.\nAnd the metabolic compromise\nessentially, in a nutshell,\nmeans they aren't getting\nenough fuel from glucose.\nThe interesting thing is that\nwhen people drink alcohol,\nyour liver converts alcohol\ninto a molecule called acetate.\nThat acetate travels up to the\nbrain and fuels brain cells,\nin particular, some\nof these reward\npathway cells more than others.\nAnd so chronic alcoholics\nhave this chronic deprivation\nof energy in these cells.\nAnd so Nora Volkow and other\nresearchers at the National\nInstitutes of Health did a\nstudy in which they set out\nto see if we can change\nthis brain metabolic problem\nin alcoholics.\nWill that affect clinical\nsymptoms of alcoholism?\nAnd will it do anything?\nIt's clinically useful.\nAnd so they actually\ndid a pilot randomized\ncontrolled trial, admitted\nalcoholics to a detox unit.\nHalf of the patients\ngot a ketogenic diet.\nThe other half got the\nstandard American diet.\nAnd then everybody\nelse, all of them\ngot the same detox protocol.\nThe patients who got\nthe ketogenic diet\nrequired fewer benzodiazepines\nfor their detox.\nDespite that, they had\nfewer withdrawal symptoms\nfrom the alcohol.\nThey reported fewer\ncravings for alcohol.\nAnd the researchers\ndid brain scans,\nwhich showed improved brain\nmetabolism in these key areas\nthat they were looking at.\nAnd their brains\nshowed reduced levels\nof neuroinflammation,\nwhich was also something\nthey were really interested in.\nAnd so that one study says to\nus that even though most people\nwould think alcoholism has\nnothing to do with diet,\nalcohol is just\ndrinking too much.\nIt's a matter of willpower.\nOr it's somebody\nwho's addictive.\nThey've got an\naddictive personality,\nand it's that simple.\nYou come out of the womb with\nan addictive personality.\nAnd those people are novelty\nseekers, and they're impulsive.\nAnd they have no patience.\nThey have no discipline.\nThey can't sustain any kind\nof rewarding experience.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\nchildhood trauma.\nThere's a--\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --story there,\nwhich there very well may be.\nBut--\nCHRIS PALMER: And there may be.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nCHRIS PALMER: But what that\nresearch study strongly\nsuggests--\nand again, yes, maybe we need\nlarger controlled trials.\nBut this is one of the leading\nneuroscientists in the world\nwho's hot on this trail.\nThis is what she believes.\nAnd this is what I believe.\nIt's that if we can correct\nthe brain metabolic defects\nfrom chronic alcohol\nuse, we might\nbe able to help people be\nsober and give them a fighting\nchance.\nOr give them an edge\nup or pull a lever\nthat we can use in their\nfavor, for their benefit.\nThere's one caution to\nall of this research\nthat I really do\nwant to highlight.\nAnd so now, I'm going\nto get hate mail\nfrom all the keto community.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's OK.\nI admire you for talking\nabout nutrition at all\nbecause anytime one\ntalks about nutrition,\nyou're going to get\nhate mail from somebody.\nCHRIS PALMER: So the\ncaveat to all of this\nis that as part of the research\nthat those researchers were\ndoing, they actually\nwanted to see\nwhat will happen\nto alcohol levels\nif an animal consumes alcohol\nwhile on a ketogenic diet.\nSo they didn't do\nthis in humans yet.\nThis is a fairly\neasy study to do.\nSo I'm hoping somebody\nwill do this study soon.\nBut they instead put\nrats half of them\non a standard diet and half\nof them on a ketogenic diet.\nAnd then they exposed them\nto the exact same amount\nof alcohol.\nThe rats who were on\nthe ketogenic diet\nhad a five-fold increase\nin blood alcohol levels.\nFive-fold increase.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMeaning, they drank more?\nOr--\nCHRIS PALMER: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --it was\nmetabolized differently.\nCHRIS PALMER: It was\nmetabolized differently.\nThe rats all got the\nsame amount of alcohol.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people\nout there who are ketogenic,\nI'm chuckling, but who are\nnot alcoholics-- please,\nalcoholics, please\ndo something about it\nbecause it's so detrimental.\nBut I guess does this mean that\nthey can drink less in order\nto get the effect of alcohol\nthat most people are seeking?\nCHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates.\nCheap date is what\nyou call that.\nYou only need a half a drink\ninstead of three drinks.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I would think\nthe keto community would thank\nyou for this unless they somehow\nhave a stake in the alcohol\nindustry.\nCHRIS PALMER: The\nreason that I put it\nas a caution is that if anybody\nis struggling with alcoholism\nand thinks hey, I\nneed an edge up.\nI need a lever to pull\nbecause I'm really struggling\nto give this stuff up.\nI just find myself going back.\nAnd if you're telling me my\nbrain metabolism is messed up,\nand this might help it,\nI'm all in favor of that.\nAnd yes, that's what the\nresearchers are pursuing.\nAnd that's what I'm saying\nwith the following caveat--\nthat if you relapse while\non a ketogenic diet,\nyou better not drink the\nsame amount of alcohol\nthat you think you can drink.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt could be deadly.\nCHRIS PALMER: It\ncould be deadly,\nand/or it could be really--\nyeah, deadly to you or someone\nelse because unfortunately,\na lot of times\nwhen people drink,\nthey get behind the wheel.\nAnd they think that they can\nhandle two drinks safely.\nAnd they think, well,\nI can go out for dinner\nand have two glasses of\nwine and drive home safely.\nI know myself.\nIf you go to a\nketogenic diet, please\ndon't drive with\nthe same two drinks\nbecause it means your\nblood alcohol level--\nif it models anything that\nwe found in the rat study--\nyour blood alcohol levels\nmay be five times higher\nthan they would normally be.\nAnd that means you\nare really wasted.\nAnd you're probably\nnot safe to be driving.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nProbably the same\nis true for drinking on\nan empty stomach, right?\nCHRIS PALMER: Yup.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nNow, it's a very\nimportant point.\nAnd thank you for raising that.\nI hear this again\nabout mitochondria,\nabout blood glucose, you\nmentioned astrocytes.\nAnd for those of you--\nthat earlier astrocytes\nare a non-neuron cell type\nin the brain, a glial cell type\nthat my postdoc advisor was\nknown for popularizing the\nmodern science of glia,\nwhich include astrocytes.\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't\nsay that they are considered\nthe cells that hold everything\ntogether in the brain\nand are kind of\npassive observers.\nBut they do many\nthings actively.\nI think now people appreciate\nthe astrocytes at least\nas important as the neurons.\nAnd certainly, for\ndisease, they are often\nimplicated in warding off\nof disease, et cetera.\nEverything that you're\ntelling me about the fact\nthat the brain can regulate\nthings that are happening\nin the body, metabolism, et\ncetera, organ health, obesity,\net cetera, to me,\nas a neuroscientist,\nthat's not surprising.\nAll of it just screams\nhypothalamus, hypothalamus,\nhypothalamus because\nhere, you're telling me,\nit's regulating these basal\nfunctions like metabolism.\nIt's regulating how\nmuch we crave things.\nAnd of course,\nhypothalamus is involved\nin motivation and craving.\nThere are other areas, too--\nother areas of the\nbrain, too, of course.\nBut I would imagine\nthat someone ought to\nor has mapped out where the\nreceptors for all this business\nare in the brain.\nAnd I guess that raises\nthe question of, when\none goes on a ketogenic or low\nblood glucose diet or fast,\nhas anyone observed\nchanges in the brain?\nHas anyone had neuroimaging\nof humans and their brains\nunder conditions of ingesting\none diet or another,\nwhether or not\nthey're psychiatric--\nsuffering from a\npsychiatric disorder or not?\nI would think that's\nwhere the gold is.\nCHRIS PALMER: We do have\nsome of those studies.\nWhen you do a\nneuroimaging study,\nyou can measure a lot\nof different things.\nSo one thing with\na PET scan, you\ncan measure glucose metabolism.\nSo a researcher,\nStephen Cunnane is\ndoing that research in\nparticular in Alzheimer's\ndisease patients and Alzheimer's\ndisease models but in humans.\nAnd that's because\nwe know that--\nagain, a common\nfinding in patients\nwith Alzheimer's disease is\nthis glucose hypometabolism,\nsome people are\nattributing it to insulin\nsignaling impairment.\nAnd so some people are\ncalling it type III diabetes.\nAt the end of the day,\nI think the clearest\nsignal that we\nhave is that cells\naren't getting enough energy\nfrom glucose as a fuel source.\nThat is something that I\nthink I can confidently\nsay that's backed by\nnumerous research studies.\nThere's debate in\nthe research field\nabout whether that's a\nprimary driver of the illness.\nI happen to believe it is.\nAnd if you ask the\nquestion, well,\nwhy would cells not be getting\nenough fuel from glucose?\nYou have to focus\non mitochondria\nbecause they're\nthe ones producing\nthe fuel from that glucose.\nSo you somehow you have\nto implicate mitochondria\nin that process\none way or another.\nOthers will say, no, that's\njust a side effect of whatever's\ncausing Alzheimer's disease.\nSo Stephen Cunnane has\ndone studies where he even\ngives ketone supplements.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: These\nare liquid ketone esters?\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone\nesters or ketone salts.\nAnd it has actually found that\nthese brain metabolism deficits\ncan be corrected,\nat least short-term,\nby giving a ketone supplement.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is this\nin the context of people\nalso ingesting\nsome carbohydrate?\nBecause I confess, I've\ntried the ketogenic diet.\nI probably did it wrong.\nThis was years ago.\nAnd then the cyclic\nketogenic diet.\nBut in the last year\nor so, I've started\nusing liquid ketone esters.\nAnd I do eat some\ncarbohydrates each day,\nusually in proportion to how\nmuch high intensity exercise\nI'm doing.\nThose liquid ketone\nesters, for me--\nat least subjectively--\nI feel greatly\nincrease my energy levels and\nmy ability to focus mentally.\nAnd they improve my sleep.\nThis is my observation\ntracking some data\nbut just, again, subjectively.\nSo in this example,\nare you talking\nabout people taking\nketone esters or ketone\nsalts on a backdrop\nof a ketogenic diet\nor on the backdrop of\na more typical diet?\nCHRIS PALMER: So he's done both.\nSo he's done studies where\npatients aren't doing\nanything special with the diet.\nSo they're eating\nwhatever they normally\neat, absolutely\nnonketogenic, giving them\na ketone salt or ester,\nand then noticing\nimmediate and direct\nchanges in the metabolism\nof these metabolically\ncompromised brain cells\nas measured by PET imaging.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: These are not\nhousehold pets, by the way.\nSorry, I have--\nwe have to just--\nP-E-T, positron emission\ntomography, not pets.\nAlthough, I'm sure that\nthere are people out there\nwho have their dogs,\nor cats, or whatever,\nor their pet kangaroos,\nwhatever you might own,\non ketogenic diet.\nOK.\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nSo he's actually moved further.\nHe's done a pilot\ntrial in a nursing home\nactually, where he did\nnot put the patients\non a ketogenic diet.\nHe simply reduced\ncarbohydrate consumption\nat breakfast and lunch.\nThey still got the same\ndinner as everyone else.\nAnd simply reducing\ncarbohydrate consumption\nat breakfast and lunch resulted\nin cognitive improvement\nin a statistically significant\nway in some of those subjects.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I love\nthat result. I'm sorry,\nI just have to highlight this.\nI'm a huge believer in\ndirecting carbohydrates\nto specific portions\nof the day when\none needs to be less\nfocused and alert\nand yet can replenish glycogen.\nLimiting carbohydrates most\nof the time during the day,\nfor me, has been a game\nchanger in terms of maintaining\nalertness, et cetera.\nI'm not aware that I have\nage-related cognitive decline.\nBut then again, I would-- people\naround me may argue otherwise.\nCHRIS PALMER: Let me say,\nyou are Andrew Huberman.\nThere is no way you have\n[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Although\nyou didn't know me\nas a six-year-old--\nCHRIS PALMER: If you have\ncognitive impairment,\nwe're all screwed.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I have plenty\nof flaws and impairments--\nwell over 3,000\ndocumented by people\nvery close to me.\nBut this is very\ninteresting, I think,\nin the context of everything\nwe've been talking about\nbecause could it be\nthat supplementing\nwith liquid ketones\nor prescribing\nliquid ketones to people\nwho are challenged with mood\ndisorders-- or things of that\nsort-- could be beneficial,\neven if they are not\nwilling or able to adhere\nto a ketogenic diet?\nCHRIS PALMER: That is the\nmillion dollar question\nright now.\nAnd we don't have good\ntrial data to say yes or no.\nMy speculation, my hunch,\nhaving tried that clinically\nwith patients, is it\ndoesn't seem to work.\nIt's not the same thing.\nThe bigger reason for my\nfeeling confident in saying that\nis that we've had\nketone salts and esters\navailable for over a decade now.\nWe have tens of thousands of\nchildren and adolescents who\nare following a strict,\nridiculously strict, ketogenic\ndiet to control their epilepsy.\nThose kids would love to\nbe off the ketogenic diet.\nTheir parents would love to have\nthem off the ketogenic diet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no\nbirthday cake, no ice cream.\nCHRIS PALMER: There\nis not one case report\nof any child controlling\nhis or her seizures using\nexogenous ketones without\nalso doing the ketogenic diet.\nI just find it hard to\nbelieve that at least some\nof those people haven't\ntried it out to see.\nI do know some patients\nwith bipolar disorder\nand even schizophrenia who\nare doing extraordinarily well\non a ketogenic diet.\nThey have tried to switch\noff the ketogenic diet using\nexogenous ketones.\nTheir symptoms came back.\nAnd so they found that\nit just wasn't effective.\nNow, again, those are anecdotes.\nMy scientific\nspeculation about why\nis because the ketogenic diet is\nactually not necessarily about\nketones themselves.\nKetones are one of a\nmultifaceted story there.\nAnd so when people\ndo a ketogenic diet,\nthey're also improving--\nthey're lowering glucose levels.\nThey're improving\ninsulin signaling.\nThey're ramping up mitochondrial\nbiogenesis, in particular,\nin the liver because\nmitochondria actually\nmake ketones.\nThat's where they're made.\nAnd they're primarily made\nin the liver mitochondria.\nSo when somebody is\non in a fasting state\nor on a ketogenic diet,\ntheir liver mitochondria\ngo through the roof because\nthey're being called to action.\nIt's like, hey, body's\nin starvation mode.\nGet to work.\nAnd so the mitochondria--\nthe cell senses we need\nmore mitochondria to process\nfat to turn it into ketones so\nthat those ketones can get up\nto the brain and keep\nthe brain fueled,\nbecause fatty acids\ncan't fuel the brain.\nOnly ketones can.\nNow, so my sense is that--\nand the gut microbiome changes\nand everything, the\nchanges in hormones--\nso if you're eating\na lot of donuts\nand drinking a\nbottle of ketones,\nthe donuts are going\nto prevent your body\nfrom lowering glucose levels.\nYou're still going to\nhave the high glucose\nlevels from the donuts.\nYou're still going\nto probably have\nthe impaired insulin signaling.\nYou're probably still\ngoing to possibly\nhave some inflammation from\nthe inflammatory effects\nof that food.\nAnd so just drinking ketones\nalone won't be enough.\nI think for people who are\nmetabolically healthy, I'll\ninclude you in that, I think\nketones can play a really\nbeneficial role, no doubt.\nI think exogenous\nketones may, in fact,\nproven valuable in\nclinical use for patients\nwho maybe can't follow a\nsuper strict ketogenic diet\nbut maybe could do\na low carb diet.\nAnd then given the\nresearch that's\nhappening with\nalcohol use disorder,\nI could imagine a\nsituation-- here's\nthe million dollar\ntip to whoever\nwants to go out and get this,\nif it actually turns out\nto be true.\nI could imagine a scenario\nwhere we use exogenous ketones\nwith alcoholics.\nAnd that every time they have\na severe craving for alcohol,\nthey drink ketones instead.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which sort\nof tastes like alcohol.\nThe ketone esters, when I take\nthem, I drink them straight.\nSometimes I'll put\nthem in seltzer.\nAnd I'm not a big\ndrinker, as I mentioned.\nI might have an alcoholic\ndrink every once in a while.\nI just don't ever crave it.\nI just do it every maybe--\nI think 2020 was the last\ntime I had a drink of alcohol.\nSo obviously, I'm not a\ngood representative example.\nBut the ketones\ntaste good to me.\nAnd they obviously\ndon't get you drunk.\nThey do seem to flick on my\nalertness pretty quickly.\nMy understanding is that they\nare the brain's preferred fuel\nsource.\nMeaning, they are going\nto be the first fuels used\nby the brain when there's a\nbuffet of fuels available.\nIf there's glucose\nin my bloodstream,\nthere's circulating\nliquid ketones,\nthe ketones would be used\nfirst or preferentially.\nIs that true?\nCHRIS PALMER: I think\nit's a complex question.\nSome research that we have\nsuggest that there are brain\nareas or brain cells that\nrequire glucose and cannot use\nketones.\nSo 100% of the brain cannot\nbe fueled with ketones as far\nas we can tell.\nSo there are some areas\nthat require glucose.\nAnd that's probably the\nreason we have gluconeogenesis\nto keep the body going and keep\nthe brain going no matter what.\nBut when ketones are available,\nespecially if ketones are high,\nthe way I think about\nit is not that ketones\nare the preferred fuel\nsource and glucose\ngoes to the wayside.\nBut the way I think\nabout it is that you\nhave a range of\ncells with varying\ndegrees of metabolic health.\nAnd some of those\ncells are going\nto be extraordinarily healthy\nwith appropriate healthy\nabundant mitochondria.\nAnd those cells\nare probably going\nto continue to use\nglucose as a fuel source.\nBut if ketones\nhappen to be there,\nsure, they'll use that, too.\nWhy not?\nBut the real money\nis metabolically\ncompromised tissues,\nwhether it's\nbrain cells or\nother tissues that--\nwe're talking about the brain.\nSo if you've got metabolically\ncompromised brain cells--\nbecause it's not\nacross the board.\nLike with Alzheimer's\nbrain scans,\nthere are specific regions\nthat are more metabolically\ncompromised than others.\nAnd that's why we see patterns\nof atrophy in specific brain\nregions.\nIt's because those regions are\ndysfunctional metabolically\nfor whatever reason.\nAnd we can get into\nwhy that might be.\nBut my sense is that if you've\ngot a metabolically compromised\ncell, that cell is sending\nout a distress signal.\nThat cell is calling resources\nfrom the body, like feed me.\nGive me something.\nAnd if it can't use\nglucose effectively,\nit is going to suck\nup those ketones\nand then start running on all\ncylinders or closer to it.\nAnd that process is so\ncritical because what it means\nis that if that cell\nwas barely getting\nby on 60% of its\nreal ATP requirement,\nit means that it doesn't have\nenough energy for maintenance\nand repair functions.\nAs soon as you give that\ncell a hundred percent energy\nor close to it, even\nif you get it up\nto 90% of its preferred\nenergy amount,\nit can start to repair itself.\nThat's the beauty\nof the human body\nin living organisms,\nis that they\nhave a priority list of\nwhat they're going to do.\nIf that cell senses that\nthere are defective molecules,\ndefective proteins\nin this cell that\nneed to be replaced,\nonce it gets enough fuel,\nit will start repairing\nitself and doing that work.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat makes sense.\nThank you for that\nclarification.\nI'd like to talk\nabout Alzheimer's\nand age-related cognitive\ndecline generally.\nI know many people\nout there are just\nterrified of losing their\nmemory for the obvious reasons.\nMemory sets context, et cetera.\nAnd many people\nhave relatives that\nsuffer from Alzheimer's or\nother forms of dementia.\nI've heard that the\nketogenic diet and diets like\nit can be very\neffective for helping\nto offset some of the\nsymptoms of Alzheimer's\nand age-related\ncognitive decline.\nIn fact, I even have a friend\nI won't out by institution,\nwho's the chair of\nCardiology, who contacted me,\nof all people, asking whether or\nnot I was aware of any studies\nor whether or not I knew of\nanybody who had benefited from\nketogenic diet for Alzheimer's.\nAnd I thought, well, why don't\nyou ask one of your colleagues\nin neurology?\nBut his response was\nreally interesting.\nHe said there are many books out\nthere for the general public.\nThere are a lot of online\ndiscussions about this.\nThere are a lot of\nassertions about this,\nand some animal studies.\nAgain, these are his words.\nThere are very few, if any,\ncontrolled clinical trials\nexploring the role\nof the ketogenic diet\nfor the treatment or\nreversal of Alzheimer's\nand age-related\ncognitive decline.\nI'm hoping that statement\nwas incorrect or soon will be\nincorrect-- because those\ntrials are ongoing--\nbut he said, yeah, the people\nare most popular for telling us\nabout the important role\nand positive role of being\nin ketosis for Alzheimer's,\nfor some reason,\nthey just won't do\na clinical trial.\nAnd that's been frustrating\nto the community.\nSo this is a very educated,\nvery accomplished person\nwho's a physician of\nheart medicine as opposed\nto something else\nrelated to the brain.\nBut what is the story there.\nAnd for goodness' sake, why\naren't there clinical trials\non ketogenic diet\nand Alzheimer's?\nI don't expect you to be\nresponsible for that fact.\nBut goodness, I would\nthink this would\nbe the obvious thing for NIH.\nI'm on study section but not\nfor these sorts of experiments.\nWhy isn't money just avalanching\ninto this area based on all\nthe anecdotal evidence that\npeople are talking about?\nCHRIS PALMER: So\nwe've got a couple\nof small pilot clinical trials.\nThe best one was a\nrandomized controlled trial.\nI think it only included 26\nsubjects, something like that,\nrandomized to 12 weeks of a\nlow fat diet, 10-week washout,\n12 weeks of ketogenic diet.\nSome of the participants got\nketo first and then low fat.\nOther participants\ngot low fat then keto.\nAnd that trial actually\nfound that when patients\nwere in ketosis, they had\nstatistically significant\nimprovement in activities\nof daily living and quality\nof life.\nAnd they did have improvement\nin cognitive function.\nBut it didn't reach\nstatistical significance,\nthat improvement did not.\nWe've got other trials.\nWe've got several animal models\nshowing that the ketogenic diet\ncan improve biomarkers\nof Alzheimer's disease\nin Alzheimer's models.\nSo it can reduce\nplaques and tangles,\ncan even improve cognitive\nimpairment in animal models.\nAnd we've got a couple\nof other small pilot\ntrials of ketogenic\ndiet in humans,\nshowing that it improves\nbiomarkers compared\nto, say, the low fat diet or\nthe American Heart Association\ndiet.\nSo we've got those.\nI think one of the\nbiggest challenges\nthat I'll just share openly--\nand this is-- I'm\nsomebody who's pretty\npassionate about this research.\nAnd I believe it has\na lot of potential.\nBut Johns Hopkins'\nresearchers attempted\nto do exactly this kind of a\nstudy, Alzheimer's patients'\nketogenic diet\nversus the, I think,\nAmerican Academy of Aging--\nor something like that--\ndiet, is the controlled diet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhich presumably\nhas starches in there.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nthat's the key variable.\nCHRIS PALMER: Probably\nlots of-- yeah, lots of--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd some potatoes--\nCHRIS PALMER: Whole grains,\nlots of whole grains.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, some potatoes.\nCHRIS PALMER: And they spent,\nI believe, over three years.\nThey screened over 1,300\npeople who expressed interest.\nAt the end of the\nday, I think they only\ngot 27 people to enroll.\nAnd only 14 of those\npeople completed the study.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nCHRIS PALMER: Despite\nthat, what they\nfound was that the subjects\nwho achieved ketosis\nhad cognitive improvement.\nBut people on study\nsection are going\nto look at a study like that\nand say, even if the science is\nthere, if you can't get\npeople to do this diet,\nwhy would we spend money\non researchers trying\nto get people to do this diet?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI should mention,\nstudy section is this closed\ndoor panels of 40 or so people.\nThere are many of these panels.\nDifferent divisions in the\nNational Institutes of Health\nuse different panels.\nAnd then grants are\nevaluated in a very small,\nbecause of the size of the\nfederal budget for research,\na very small percentage.\nUsually, about 10% of\nthese studies are funded.\nThe rest generally\ndon't end up happening.\nThat is very informative.\nWhat you just described\nis very informative\nbecause now it\nmakes sense to me.\nThere's no conspiracy.\nIt's not big pharma,\nI don't think,\nis trying to suppress\ntrials of ketogenic diets\non Alzheimer's because\nI would imagine\nthe first thing that\npharma would want to do\nis to see that study done.\nSo they didn't have to.\nAnd then the moment it was done,\nif it showed a positive effect,\nthey'd probably want\nto isolate the molecule\nand wrap it up in something\nthat people would take, right?\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo I don't think\nthere's any active\nsuppression by pharma.\nI think pharma would probably\nbe cheering from the sidelines\nbecause they could capitalize\non it, because ultimately,\nthe studies are\ndone by scientists.\nBut the treatments are\ngenerally doled out\nby pharmaceutical companies\nand/or physicians.\nSo I don't believe there's\na conspiracy there.\nThat is very interesting.\nAnd it's kind of amazing,\ngiven our discussion\nof earlier, which is that\nyou had a patient that\nwas having schizophrenic\nsymptoms who\nmanaged to stay on this diet.\nSo is there something special\nabout Alzheimer's patients\nand people with age-related\ncognitive decline?\nPresumably, they're\nvery dependent on others\nto cook for them\nand shop for them.\nI think that this is almost\nperfect controlled environment\nfor getting this study done.\nCHRIS PALMER: I think\nthat is the key issue.\nSo again, I got patients--\nI get patients with bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia,\nextraordinarily impaired\npeople to do this diet\nand stay with it.\nBut it's because I'm providing\na weekly session for them.\nAnd I imagine this\nstudy did not provide\nthat kind of intensive support.\nIn the pilot trial that\nI described to you,\nthey actually got, I\nthink, over 90% compliance\nwith the different\ndietary interventions.\nSo some of it is going to\nbe dependent on the research\ngroup.\nAnd does the research group\nunderstand that this is not--\nit's not like\nprescribing a pill.\nHere, take this pill.\nAnd take it every day and\ncome back in three weeks.\nAnd even then, we\ndon't know for sure\nthat the patient took\nthe pill every day.\nWe just assume they\ntook the pill every day.\nAnd studies say they\nprobably didn't.\nSo I think when we think\nabout a dietary intervention,\nwe need to think about\nmore intensive support\nand education.\nAnd that support could be a\nhealth and wellness coach.\nIt could be a dietician.\nIt could be education\nof the family.\nIt might even be providing\nthem with dietary meals.\nThat maybe for six months,\nwe actually provide them\nwith ketogenic meals--\nonce a week, put\nthem in your freezer.\nMicrowave them when needed--\nto make this diet as easy\nand doable as possible.\nBecause if we can get\npeople to do the diet,\nif we can get them through\nthe first couple of months,\nmost people can learn\nhow to do this diet.\nMore importantly-- I\ndidn't mention this before.\nBut the number one reason I\nam so successful at getting\npatients to stay on\nthis diet for years,\nis because of the consequences\nto them when they go off of it.\nThat is the reason I can\nget schizophrenic patients\nand bipolar patients\nto do this diet,\nwhereas other people can't\nget an everyday human\nbeing to do it for weight\nloss because the weight loss\npatient doesn't experience\ndevastating tormenting symptoms\nwhen they break the diet.\nOftentimes, they are rewarded.\nThey eat something\nthey really enjoy.\nAnd they get a little bit\nof a dopamine rush from it.\nAnd they're off to the races.\nThey're like, I'm going to--\noh, I've already cheated.\nI'll cheat again.\nI'll get back on it someday.\nAnd they never get around to it.\nMy patients, when\nthey go off the diet,\nthey start hallucinating\nwithin 48--\nor 24, 48 hours.\nAnd they quickly realize that\nwas a really stupid thing\nto do.\nThat piece of cake\nwas not at all worth\nthe torment that I'm\nexperiencing now.\nSo they get back on the diet.\nI suspect with\nAlzheimer's disease,\nwe might notice\nsomething similar.\nSome of these people\nhave very mild symptoms.\nSo maybe they won't\nhave that kind\nof a reinforcement, negative\nreinforcing kind of experience.\nBut I think some of them will.\nSome of them recognize that\nthey are impaired cognitively.\nAnd if this diet could\nhelp them remember better,\nif this diet could help\nthem function better--\nand again, that's what\nthe pilot trial showed,\nis activities of daily living.\nThat means these\npeople are able to go\nto the bathroom on their own.\nThey're able to get\nthemselves dressed.\nWhereas, they needed help\nwith those things before.\nThose are actually\nreally important things\nto both the patient\nand the caregiver.\nAnd if they go off\nthe diet and then\nquickly revert into a\nmore symptomatic state,\nthat might be reinforcing\nenough for them\nto figure out a way to\ndo the diet on their own.\nAnd if we think\nabout, if this really\nis an effective\nintervention-- and yes,\nwe need longer trials,\nlarger trials, all of that,\nbecause there are\nplenty of stories\nin the medical field where\npilot trials looked really\nspectacular and promising.\nAnd then larger trials just\nfailed to show the benefits.\nI believe, based on all\nthe science of metabolism,\nmitochondria, glucose\nhypometabolism, all of that,\nI believe the science makes\nthis an obvious treatment that\nhas real potential.\nSo people will call me biased.\nThat's fine.\nI've got my bias.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based\non clinical observation\nand extensive clinical\nobservation at that--\nI think biases that\nare simply because we\nwant to feel a certain\nway or believe something\nare worth critiquing.\nBut bias based on\nobservation-- here,\nI should mention that most of\nwhat we know about human memory\nwas sparked by one patient,\na famous HM, who I think\nwas living in Harvard Medical,\nin one of the hospitals around.\nThere are many hospitals\non Longwood Campus.\nBut one patient, the\nreason we associate\nthe hippocampus with memory\nis because we knew that HM's\nthe hippocampus\nwas intentionally\ndamaged for epilepsy treatment.\nSo this idea that\neverything has to be\na randomized clinical\ntrial, to me, is crazy.\nOf course, that's\na gold standard.\nAnd it's essential.\nBut there's so much information\nin textbooks, medical textbooks\nin particular, that are gleaned\nfrom single-patient case\nstudies or from three-patient\nneurostimulation in the brain\nor something of that sort.\nSo to me, I'm still\nperplexed as to why\nthere's this insistence on\nonly one form of evidence.\nClearly, what you're\ndoing, the important work\nthat you're doing clinically,\nand in the research side,\nand in public communication,\nis assisting this.\nI have a question about--\nor more of a statement/question\nabout the ketogenic diet.\nBased on everything\nthat we've talked about,\nseems to me that the\nketogenic diet for weight loss\nis a very interesting\naspect of the diet\nas is intermittent\nfasting for weight loss\neven though it might just be\nby way of caloric restriction\nthat occurs with fasting.\nBut then in some\nways, the effects\nof the ketogenic\ndiet on weight loss\nare a bit of a decoy\nfor most people.\nThat's where their mind goes.\nThis person lost X\namount of weight.\nMaybe that made\nthem feel better.\nMaybe that actually\nmade them underweight.\nI think you've talked about it.\nFor some people, it can actually\nbring them under weight.\nI'm glad that we got\nthe chance to dive\ninto the description of\nketogenic diet for epilepsy\nbecause it really is a\nmedical intervention that\nhas a side effect of\nweight loss or could\nbe used to treat obesity\nand induce weight loss.\nBut it's really about\nfar more than that.\nAnd that raises a question\nfor me, which is--\nwe've been talking about the\nketogenic diet as one thing.\nBut I've heard you\ndiscuss this before,\nwhere just as a physician will\nprescribe different dosage\nranges of a given drug, you\ncan prescribe different dosage\nranges of a nutritional\nplan, a diet.\nIt's not one thing.\nIt's not necessarily\nzero carbohydrates\nor 100 grams or 50 grams.\nIt depends on the patient\nand a lot of other factors.\nI've heard you list off\nvarious things classic keto.\nMaybe you could just briefly\ntell us what that typically\nis, because I think\nmost people think\nit means eating a lot of\nmeat and not carbohydrates.\nBut it might not be that.\nFasting and then some\nof the other-- you\nmentioned Atkins earlier.\nWe don't have to go into\neach of these in detail.\nAnd I know in your\nbook, you talk about\nnot just the science and\nclinical background but also\nsome actionable steps that\npeople could consider.\nSo they can refer\nthere for more detail.\nBut for somebody\nwho, let's say, is\ndepressed-- they've had\nsome rounds of depression.\nMaybe they're on\nantidepressants, maybe not--\nand they want to try\nsomething like this.\nObviously, this has to be done\nin concert with a physician\nobserving all this.\nBut what is the typical thing\nthat you probe with first?\nJust like with a\ndrug, you might probe\nwith 20 milligrams of a drug.\nWhat's your typical initial\ndietary intervention probe?\nTerrible languaging, I realize.\nAnd I'm criticizing\nmyself for that.\nBut I think people get the idea.\nCHRIS PALMER: The real\nanswer is that I don't have\na one-size-fits-all\nrecommendation for any person.\nSo the first thing\nthat I'm going\nto assess with the patient is,\nwhat symptoms are they having?\nWhat is their current diet like?\nAnd what are they willing to do?\nI try to meet them\nwhere they're at.\nSo if somebody-- and\nI want to point out.\nYou mentioned the\nall-meat version\nof this diet, which\nis often referred\nto as the carnivore diet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Very\ncontroversial diet.\nCHRIS PALMER: There is\nno doubt that exists.\nSome people swear by it.\nThey swear they've tried other\nversions of ketogenic diets\nand only when they went\nto a carnivore diet\ndid they get benefits.\nBut there are vegetarian\nand vegan versions\nof the ketogenic diet.\nSo in my mind,\nthis is not at all\nabout the diet wars\nof animal-sourced\nversus plant-sourced foods.\nIt's about inducing a\nstate of ketosis, which\nis mimicking the fasting state.\nThat is what it's about.\nAnd you can do that by\nnot eating anything,\nby fasting and/or\nintermittent fasting.\nAnd you get your results.\nSo no diet is a ketogenic diet.\nSo it's not about the\nfoods or the types of foods\nthat you're eating.\nIt's about inducing\na state of ketosis.\nThe first variable I'm going to\nlook at when I recommend this\nor prescribe this is the\nperson's current weight.\nIf somebody is obese\nversus somebody who's thin,\nI'm going to use different\ndietary strategies\nfor those two situations.\nIn the obese patient, they\nhave tons of fat stores\non their body already.\nUsually, it is a goal of theirs\nto tap into some of those.\nAnd they'd like to\nlose some weight\nif they're going to try a\nketogenic diet for brain health\nanyway.\nAnd so I'm going to use that.\nSo that person, really, the diet\nis carbohydrate restriction.\nAnd that usually is a\nsufficient intervention.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Both\nsimple carbohydrates,\nmeaning sugars\nand fructose also?\nCHRIS PALMER:\nFructose, definitely.\nSo no added sugars, essentially.\nYou can have added natural\nsweeteners like stevia or monk\nfruit.\nYou might use\nartificial sweeteners.\nYears of doing\nthis, I'd probably\nrecommend steer away\nfrom them if you\ncan because I think\nthey tend to stimulate\ncravings for high carb foods.\nSo if you can kind of get\nthrough a couple of weeks\nwithout sweet things,\nyour cravings for those\nwill go down.\nAnd it'll make the diet easier\nand a little more sustainable.\nBut let's say you can have\nyour artificial sweeteners,\nif that's what you really want.\nSo I'm going to say less\nthan 20 grams of carbs a day\nfor those people.\nThey can have all the\nprotein they want.\nThey can have vegetables.\nAnd they can have all\nthe fat they want.\nBut I'm not going to\npush fat on those people.\nI'm not going to tell them, eat\na lot of fat, at the same time\nbecause I want to use the fat\non their body as the fat source,\nat least early on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAre you encouraging\nhealthy fats like\nmonounsaturated fats,\nlike olive oil?\nAre you encouraging people\nto eat a little less\nbutter, et cetera?\nCHRIS PALMER: I tend\nto encourage, again,\na wide range of fats.\nAnd it's going to\ndepend on the person.\nA lot of times, people come to\nme with very specific ideas.\nBut I'm going to tend to\nencourage olive oil, avocados,\nnuts, which are\nusually considered,\neven by the American\nHeart Association,\nhealthy sources of fat.\nThe more controversial\nthing are things\nlike coconut oil or coconut\ncream, which the American Heart\nAssociation might say\nis not a healthy fat,\nI kind of disagree with\nthat and don't think\nit's unhealthy at all actually.\nAnd when you look at the\nepidemiological studies\nof saturated fat\ncausing heart disease\nor causing adverse outcomes, at\nbest, maybe increases your risk\n10% to 15%-- at best.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHow much coconut oil\ncan people ingest, anyway,\nbefore they either develop\ndiarrhea-- no joke--\nor just sort of get\ntired of coconut oil?\nAnyway, your point is taken.\nBut they can eat meat\nif they like meat?\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\nthey can eat eggs.\nOr if they don't\nlike meat and eggs,\nthey could eat sardines\nor things of that sort.\nI personally can't--\nI can't even stomach the--\nI don't even like\nthe word \"sardine.\"\nI have nothing against\nthe actual fish.\nBut that's just me.\nBut obviously, people have--\nI say this because people have\ndifferent preferences, right?\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'll eat a steak.\nBut I'm not going\nto eat a sardine.\nCHRIS PALMER: And I'm\ngoing to go with that.\nAnd again, there are vegan\nsources of protein that--\npeople can eat tempeh\nand other things.\nSo that's the obese person.\nIt's carb restriction as\nthe primary initial phase.\nThe thin person is going\nto need to eat a lot of fat\nbecause they don't have a lot\nof fat stores on their body.\nAnd if I want them in\nketosis, clinical ketosis,\nI'm going to have\nto feed them fat.\nSo that's the person\nthat I'm going\nto say, make sure\nyou get in avocados,\nolive oil, butter,\nmaybe heavy cream.\nSo heavy cream is delicious.\nIt's a delicious way\nto get your fats in.\nI have one patient who\njust drinks it straight,\nto just try to get it in.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I get it.\nI've never had an\nappetite for sweets.\nI absolutely love\nsavory fatty food.\nWhen I was in high\nschool, I was thin.\nSo I was able to do this.\nBut I used to drink\nhalf-and-half.\nSometimes I wake up in\nthe middle of the night\nand drink it just because\nit tastes so, so good.\nCHRIS PALMER: It\ndoes taste good.\nSo if they're on\na ketogenic diet,\nI'm going to push them\naway from half-and-half\nand toward heavy whipping cream.\nSo you can whip that up.\nYou can freeze it.\nIt turns into ice cream.\nYou can add vanilla.\nYou can add cocoa powder.\nYou can add all sorts of things.\nAnd you're off to the races\nwith shakes, and ice cream,\nand mousse, and all sorts\nof things that you can have.\nWith any of these patients,\nthe beauty of this diet\nis I have objective biomarkers.\nI'm going to have them\nmeasuring ketones.\nAnd I'm going to adjust the diet\nbased on their state of ketosis\nand/or the clinical benefits\nthat I'm looking for.\nIf it's an average person,\nwho is not currently\nunder psychiatric care, not\ntaking prescription medicines\nbut is saying, I'm burned out.\nI'm exhausted.\nI want some of that brain\nenergy that Andrew Huberman\nis talking about.\nHe talks about feeling good.\nI want some of that.\nI'm probably actually\ngoing to recommend\nthe protocol you\ndescribe, which is,\nlet's see if we can just\ncarb restrict for a while\nand see if that produces\nclinical benefit.\nI have one-- he's\nnot even a patient,\njust somebody who read my book.\nI didn't tell him anything.\nAnd he came away\nfrom it saying--\nhe was ready to start an\nantidepressant for his anxiety.\nHe had chronic anxiety,\nwas trying meditation,\nwas trying all sorts of things.\nNothing-- those\nthings weren't enough.\nHe was ready to go on\nprescription medicine.\nHe read an early\ncopy of the book.\nHe took it upon himself without\nconsulting with me to restrict\ncarbohydrates alone.\nHe did not go ketogenic.\nHe is a vegetarian.\nHe restricted carbs.\nWithin three weeks,\nsaid, I don't\nneed prescription medicine.\nI can't believe how\nmuch better I feel.\nAnd all I did was cut\nout some of the high carb\nfoods in my diet.\nSo I think for some people,\nit can be that simple.\nFor people with serious\nmental disorders,\nif they are chronically\ndepressed, if they're\non lots of prescription\nmeds, if they're\ndisabled by their\nsymptoms, and certainly,\nif you're bipolar or have\nschizophrenia or something,\nthose are the people\nI really do want\nthem to work with a\nmedical professional\nbecause meds may\nneed to be adjusted.\nThey need a real\nshot at this diet.\nIt's not like weight loss.\nWeight loss, everybody wings it.\nAnd either you're\nsuccessful or you aren't.\nYou look on the internet or\nyou read a book or you do--\neven the colleague\nthat you mentioned,\nhe's probably just reading--\nwho knows whether it's\ncredible information or not--\nand just winging it, and\nseeing whether it works or not.\nFor people with serious\nmental disorders,\nI want you to treat it like you\nhave epilepsy because you do\nhave a serious brain disorder.\nIt's impairing your ability\nto function in the world.\nIt's impairing your\nhealth and happiness.\nYou deserve a competent\nmedical treatment.\nAnd we have that.\nWe have a hundred-year\nevidence-based.\nWe've got dieticians\nwho know this\nlike the back of their hand.\nThey can monitor your\nlevel of ketosis.\nThey can help look for vitamin\nand nutrient deficiencies\nthat can be a\nconsequence of the diet,\nand make sure that you're\nnot developing those.\nThey can help tweak\nthe diet if needed.\nThey can give you ideas if\nyou're getting bored with eggs\nevery morning.\nThey can give you ideas for\nwhat else you might have.\nAnd if you're using it to\ntreat a serious disorder,\nI think you need serious help.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\ncouple of questions,\na little more detailed,\nbut I think a lot of people\nwill have this on their mind.\nIs it ever the case\nthat you'll prescribe\nsomebody the ketogenic\ndiet in conjunction\nwith intermittent fasting?\nSo eat keto but eat\nbetween the hours\nof, whatever, 11:00 AM and\n8:00 PM or something like that.\nThat's the first question.\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.\nAnd I have one patient with\ntype 2 diabetes and chronic\ndepression.\nAnd he will try to follow\nthe ketogenic diet.\nAnd sometimes, his blood\nsugars are still very high.\nAnd sometimes I\nwill ask him to do\neither intermittent fasting or\neven a three or four day water\nfast.\nAnd it is shocking.\nWhen he does a three or four\nday water fast, the first day\nor two, he feels like crap.\nI'll just say up front,\ndon't do it if you've got\nan important meeting or\nbusiness trip or anything.\nDon't be--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So this\nis just consuming water.\nCHRIS PALMER: This is\njust consuming water.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNo black coffee?\nCHRIS PALMER: I usually tell him\nhe can have plain black coffee\nor tea.\nBut--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nhave mercy after all.\nCHRIS PALMER: I have\na tiny ounce of mercy.\nBut when he does it, his blood\nsugars plummet in a good way,\nhis blood sugars\nare normalizing.\nBut the last time he did it,\nhe actually got to seven days\nat one point.\nAnd he said, I feel great.\nI want to keep going.\nI can't believe\nthat I'm not hungry.\nBut I am not hungry at all.\nI don't miss food at all.\nAnd at seven days, I\nkind of cut the cord.\nI was like, no, no.\nWe're done.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHe needs to eat.\nCHRIS PALMER:\n[LAUGHS] We're done.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You got to eat.\nWell, I find it\nreally interesting\nthat the intermittent\nfasting, of course,\ncontroversial at some level,\nbut as to whether or not\nit's just beneficial by way\nof caloric restriction--\nbecause it is one way to\nachieve caloric restriction--\nwhether or not has\nadditional benefits.\nBut I'm very interested\nin the neural side of it.\nAnd it does seem\nthat the fasted state\ncan start to take on its\nown rewarding properties,\nwhere people get\ndopamine release not\nfrom eating, as\nmost everyone does,\nbut from abstaining from food.\nNow, this can be pathologic\nin the sort of example\nof anorexia nervosa, which\nis we both know as the most\ndeadly psychiatric illness.\nBut for non-anoxerics,\nI think it's\ninteresting to note that\neventually not eating can have\nits own rewarding properties\nto it that aren't just related\nto weight loss.\nBut in the short-term, feeling--\nin other words, feeling\nreally good by way\nof abstaining from eating.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yes.\nAnd that's actually-- it\nraises an important risk\nthat I haven't mentioned yet.\nBut at least in\npsychiatric patients--\nbut even in some\npatients who just\nuse the keto diet\nfor weight loss,\nI have seen definite hypomania.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo these are people\nthat aren't sleeping very much.\nAre they also getting\nkind of delusional,\nthinking they're going\nto run for president?\nCHRIS PALMER: No.\nSo the distinction between\nhypomania and mania--\nso mania, you might become\npsychotic and delusional.\nMania, by definition,\nis problematic.\nIt's causing a problem\nin some way or another.\nAnd if you have\npsychotic symptoms,\nit's definitely called\nmania, full-blown mania.\nHypomania, for\nbetter or worse, is\nsomething every human\nbeing probably craves.\nSo it is feeling\nextraordinarily good.\nIt's getting by on less sleep.\nBut you don't need to sleep.\nWho needs sleep?\nI've got things to do.\nMy brain is running\non all cylinders.\nI feel so creative.\nThere have been lots\nof famous people\nthrough the ages who have been\nbipolar, probably bipolar.\nAnd some of their most\nproductive periods of time,\nwhether it's art or\ncreating scientific models\nor what-have-you, were probably\nduring hypomanic episodes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So what\ndo you do in that case?\nI'm obsessed with getting\nsufficient quality sleep.\nIt's a kind of a repeating\ntheme in our podcast\nand many of my\nsocial media posts.\nAnd I always recommend\nbehavioral tools first,\nthen exercise, viewing\nsunlight, et cetera,\nat appropriate times,\navoiding late night\nartificial light exposure,\net cetera, and occasionally,\nfor people who\nare doing all that\nand still struggle with\nsleep, supplementation.\nOne of the things that\nI've seen some data on\nis that for people who are\nfollowing a low carbohydrate\ndiet, that inositol,\nin particular,\ncan be helpful for\ngetting into sleep\nprobably because it's\na bit of an-- has\na bit of an anti-anxiety effect.\nBut presumably, there are\nother things out there, too.\nThe magnesiums will\ngenerally do that.\nA hot bath will do that,\ntoo, for that matter.\nBut what you're talking about\nis people who are going,\nwhat, a day and a\nhalf without sleep?\nOr they're just two\nhours of sleep a night?\nCHRIS PALMER: So\nthe worst case I\nsaw was actually a mental\nhealth professional who\ndidn't recognize it initially.\nHe went six months with\ntwo to four hours of sleep\nevery night.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they\nwere on a ketogenic diet?\nCHRIS PALMER: He was\non a ketogenic diet,\nwas getting by on two to four\nhours of sleep every night,\ndid not initially recognize\nthat this was a problem.\nHe was feeling great.\nHe was feeling that keto high.\nAnd he was actually\nwaking up at 4:00 AM,\ngoing for 10 to 20\nmile runs most days.\nHe finally stopped the ketogenic\ndiet after about six months\nbecause he said, I can't\nmaintain my weight.\nI'm losing too much weight.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, I\ndidn't mean to interrupt.\nI was just thinking there\nare some social media\npersonalities associated\nwith nutrition\nthat might be hypomanic.\nI'll let you do the\nclinical evaluation.\nSo what does somebody\ndo in that case?\nSo I don't know that\nI've ever been hypomanic.\nBut as I mentioned\nearlier, unless I've\ndone a very high intensity\nworkout early in the day\nand I need to replenish\ncarbohydrates,\nI typically eat meat, fruit, and\nvegetables throughout the day--\nminimum amounts\nof fruit but some.\nAnd then at night, I switch\nover to mainly carbohydrate.\nIt really helps me sleep.\nIt replenishes glycogen stores.\nI sleep really well, wake\nup the next morning, repeat.\nAnd of course, this goes\nagainst a lot of the dogma\nthat, oh, you're not\nsupposed to eat carbohydrates\nlate in the day and [MUMBLES].\nThis is what works for me.\nAnd so I do it.\nFor somebody like this mental\nhealth professional, who\nis hypomanic, would going off\nthe ketogenic diet entirely\nbe the best idea?\nOr could it be\nthat adjusting when\nthey eat their carbohydrates\nwould be advantageous\nin order to make\nsure that they felt\nalert and great during the day?\nMaybe not hypomanic\nbut then could\nhave a four to eight-hour a\nnight sleep as opposed to a two\nto four hours a night, which\nis really very little sleep.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah, it's not--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\ncan't be healthy.\nCHRIS PALMER: It's not healthy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Even if you\ncan do it and feel great,\nI imagine that the\nbrain is suffering.\nCHRIS PALMER: It is.\nAnd the body is suffering.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nyour friends and family\nare suffering.\nCHRIS PALMER: The body is\nrepairing itself with sleep.\nAnd so yeah, it's--\nif it's somebody who\nis not a patient,\nthey're not a mental\nhealth patient.\nThey're not using\nthe ketogenic diet\nas a mental health treatment.\nThey're simply doing\nit for whatever.\nI actually start with\neverything you've just outlined.\nLet's start with\nbehavioral measures first.\nAnd the first\nintervention is education.\nYou need at least six\nhours of sleep a night.\nPeriod, end of story.\nThat's non-negotiable.\nIf you're not getting at least\nsix hours of sleep a night,\nwe need to consider\nthis a problem.\nSo figure out a way to\nget 6 hours of sleep.\nFor some people, that's\nenough, just the education.\nThey don't get out\nof bed at 3:00 AM.\nIt might take them an hour\nto fall back to sleep.\nThey fall back to sleep.\nFor most people, if you can get\nthree nights of decent sleep\nin a row, the\nhypomania goes away.\nThat is the way\nto extinguish it.\nAnd then they still go on\nfeeling a high from it.\nThey feel great.\nTheir brain feels good in\nterms of memory, concentration,\nmotivation, all of those things.\nBut they're not\nhypomanic anymore.\nAnd then I might use\nsupplements, melatonin, others\nthat you mentioned,\nmagnesium is a big one.\nAnd for some, I will recommend\nexactly what you're doing--\neat some carbohydrates\nin the evening\nbefore you're going to bed.\nEither have them at dinner\nand then wait a few hours\nbefore you're going to go\nto bed or have them right\nbefore you're going\nto go to bed, just\nto try to calm your body\ndown and get it going.\nWhen I'm using this as\na clinical intervention,\nespecially with patients\nwith serious mental illness,\nI actually want them in a\nstate of ketosis long-term.\nSo I'm not going to do the\ncarbohydrate intervention.\nI'm going to try\nall the other ones.\nBut if they still can't\nsleep even with supplements,\nover the counter\nsupplements, then I'm\nprobably going to go with\nprescription, sleeping\nmedicines, as a\ntemporary stopgap\nto try to get them three to\nseven days of decent sleep.\nThat usually breaks\nthe hypomanic cycle.\nAnd then they stay\non the ketogenic diet\nbecause it ends up resulting in\nall of these other improvements\nthat I've described.\nTheir illness can sometimes\ngo in to full remission.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it low\ndose trazodone as a first line\nprescription?\nCHRIS PALMER: I would\nnot use trazodone.\nI would actually\nspecifically avoid trazodone\nbecause it's an antidepressant.\nAnd they're already hypomanic.\nAnd I certainly don't\nwant to push that further.\nSo as long as it's somebody\nwithout a history of addiction,\nI'm going to use\na benzodiazepine\nor either commonly called\nthe Z medicines for sleep--\nzolpidem or Ambien or\nsomething like that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those tap\ninto the opioid pathway?\nGABA opioid?\nCHRIS PALMER: GABA.\nI usually start with something\nlike Ativan or Klonopin\nor something like that--\nprobably Ativan because\nit's shorter-acting.\nAnd again, I'm only looking\nto use it short-term.\nI let them know that up front.\nWe're looking for three to\nseven days of decent sleep.\nAnd then we're going to try\nto get them off that medicine.\nAnd usually, people\nare off to the races\nand can sustain it well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\nquestion about hormones.\nMany of the Huberman Lab\npodcast listeners will ask--\nany time we're talking about\nsomething like exercise\nor a drug treatment or\nbehavioral training,\npeople will say, what\nabout the menstrual cycle?\nHow is that impacted by this?\nHow does the menstrual cycle\nimpact its efficacy, et cetera?\nCarbohydrates and\ncaloric restriction\nhave been implicated in\ndifferent interactions--\nare known to interact\nwith the endocrine system.\nSo what do you do if you have\na patient who is depressed\nor could have\npsychotic symptoms--\nbut let's go with depression\nbecause that's probably a bit\nmore familiar to most people--\nand then they're on\na low carbohydrate\nor full ketogenic diet, but\ntheir menstrual cycles cease.\nHow do you deal with\nthose adjustments?\nAnd I guess we could\nexpand this conversation\nand say, what about\nmale fertility also?\nBecause some caloric\ndiets seem to--\nmy understanding is that\nsubmaintenance caloric diets,\nso weight loss\ndiets, will improve\ntestosterone-estrogen ratios\nin males that are obese.\nBut for someone\nthat's not obese,\nto go on a sub-caloric diet,\nthat it can start to impair\ntestosterone levels and--\nprobably not render\nthem infertile\nbut certainly adjust\nthat whole axis.\nSo what about interactions\nbetween ketosis, diets,\net cetera, and the\nendocrine system?\nCHRIS PALMER: The\nreal answer is,\nI don't think anybody knows.\nAnd there's not a\none-size-fits-all answer\nbecause I've seen examples.\nAnd I'm aware of science to back\nup polar opposite conclusions.\nSo the first general\nobservation that I'll make--\nI know so many couples,\nhusbands and wives,\nboyfriends and girlfriends,\nheterosexual couples,\nwho have tried the ketogenic\ndiet to lose weight together--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nend up with a baby?\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n[LAUGHS]\nCHRIS PALMER: No.\nAlmost universally, the men\nhave a much easier time with it\nthan the women.\nIt's not across the board.\nBut I know so many examples\nwhere the women say\nI couldn't tolerate that diet.\nIt did not make me feel better.\nIt actually made me feel worse.\nAnd I think in those\ncases, it probably\ndoes relate to hormones.\nI'm aware of animal\nmodels, of mice--\nin particular, ketogenic\ndiet in mouse models.\nOne researcher shared with me,\nthe thing that was striking\nis that the female\nmice never got pregnant\non the ketogenic diet.\nWhereas, the mice\non the standard diet\nwere just having\nbabies right and left.\nAnd it was just\nshocking, the difference.\nOn the surface, it makes sense.\nThe ketogenic diet is\nmimicking the fasting state.\nWomen who are\ntrying to reproduce\nshould not be fasting.\nIf your body is in\na fasting state,\nit probably does not\nwant to expend resources,\nmetabolic resources, calories,\nnutrients, and other things,\nto creating a baby\nbecause your very life is\nbeing threatened\nby, quote unquote,\n\"fasting\" or starvation.\nThat even though\nthe ketogenic diet\nis a sustainable,\nnonstarvation diet,\nwe're really using\nthat diet to trick\nthe body into thinking that it\nis in a fasting or starvation\nstate.\nAnd so just from a kind\nof evolutionary stance,\nit makes sense that\nwomen's bodies may actually\nhave significant changes\nin hormonal status\nto prevent pregnancy\nbecause a woman should not\nbe having a baby when\nshe's starving to death.\nI know of examples of women\nwho are the opposite, though,\nwho have benefited\ndramatically and tremendously\nfrom the ketogenic\ndiet, have put\nschizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder into full remission.\nAnd I do actually know of\none case, at least one case.\nA woman, infertile,\nshe and her husband\nhad been trying for three\nyears, no pregnancy.\nShe went keto.\nWithin four months,\nshe was pregnant.\nHow do I make sense of that?\nI don't know.\nAnd unfortunately, I\ndon't think we really\nhave good control data on what\ndoes the ketogenic diet do\nto male hormonal systems, what\ndoes the ketogenic diet do\nto female hormonal systems.\nBut clearly, I think\nchanges are happening.\nI don't have a way to\npredict it, at least.\nIf somebody else has great\ninsights, I welcome them.\nBut I haven't seen\nthem published.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\na terrific answer\nbecause when things are all over\nthe place and bidirectional,\ndepending on one\ncircumstance or the other,\nI think it screams for\ncontrolled studies,\nand more descriptions\nof case studies,\nand anecdotal data, too.\nSo I think it's an\nexcellent answer.\nIt also calls to mind the\nimportant public service\nannouncement that because of\nthese bidirectional effects\nthat you described,\nplease don't use\nfasting or the ketogenic\ndiet as a reliable form\nof contraception.\nCHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYes, please don't.\nI have a final\nquestion, which relates\nto something that is very much\nstarting to get buzz now--\nand maybe more so\nfor people that\nhang out in the Twitter\nspace or the nutrition space.\nBut there's a new\nclass of drugs that I\nthink initially were\ndeveloped to treat diabetes\nbut are now being evaluated\nfor their efficacy\nto treat obesity.\nAnd these are the semaglutide\ndrugs that are involved in--\nthey tap into these glucagon\nrelated GLP-1 pathways.\nAnd it is a story that we've\ntalked about a little bit\non the podcast before.\nBut many people, I\nimagine, probably\nhaven't heard that conversation.\nI would simply like to know what\nyou think about these drugs.\nThey obviously adjust the way\nthat glucose and insulin are\nmanaging energy, both in\nthe body and the brain,\nand can produce weight loss.\nSo that to me, when I look\nat the data, it's impressive.\nBut a good logical shift\nin diet and exercise\ncould achieve\nsimilar weight loss.\nBut a lot of people\njust won't do that.\nSo the question I have\nis, what are your thoughts\non semaglutide and other GLP--\nI think I might have said\nGLT before, excuse me--\nGLP-1 related compounds?\nAnd do you ever prescribe\nthese in conjunction\nwith these dietary shifts?\nBecause it seems\nto me, they would\nfall right in with the\ncatalog of other approaches\nthat you have available.\nCHRIS PALMER: The\nreal answer is,\nI am not at all an expert\non these medications.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But what\nare your thoughts about them?\nThey seem to be\nweight loss drugs,\nnot unlike the fen-phen\ndrugs of the '90s that\nthen were banned because a few\npeople didn't handle them well.\nCHRIS PALMER: They are.\nWe had fen-phen.\nAnd even before\nthat, in the 1950s,\nand '60s, and '70s, Dexedrine--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine.\nCHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMother's little helper.\nCHRIS PALMER: --was,\nyes, was the treatment\nof choice for women\nacross the United States\nto keep their slim figures.\nAnd we created addicts\nand all sorts of problems.\nBut they were widely used and\nprobably millions of women\nbecause they work.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nthey kill appetite.\nCHRIS PALMER: They\nkill appetite.\nMy overall thoughts are this.\nThere is zero doubt in my\nmind that the obesity epidemic\nis a threat to human health and\npotentially the human species.\nIf it keeps going at\nthe rate it's going,\nit is a threat to our species.\nWe have to figure out what\non Earth is happening,\nand what can we do about it.\nThese medications,\nin early studies,\nare highly effective\nover a year or two.\nThat's promising.\nI am worried, though,\nthat we're not attacking\nthe root cause of obesity.\nIf the root cause\nof obesity ends up\nbeing some kind of poisoning\nof the metabolic machinery\nin the brain or body--\nand I would argue that probably\nrelates to mitochondrial health\nand mitochondrial function--\nI have every reason to believe\nthat taking a medication that\nhelps you lose weight may not\nbe addressing that problem.\nAnd therefore, may\nnot be addressing\nall of the negative health\nconsequences of what\nwe call obesity.\nSo obesity, in it\nof itself, we know\nthat excess fat can\nbecome inflammatory\nand can cause problems,\nin and of itself.\nBut I actually see\nobesity as a symptom.\nI see obesity as a symptom\nof metabolic derangement\nin the body or brain.\nAnd that is why\npeople become obese.\nAnd that if we're really\ngoing to get anywhere,\nwe need to identify\nwhat is causing\nthat metabolic derangement.\nUsing a symptomatic treatment\nlike a GLP-1 medication,\nto the best of my\nknowledge, is not addressing\nthat core problem.\nAnd we're just ignoring it.\nMaybe I'll be wrong.\nAnd maybe these will\nbe the wonder drug that\nsaved the human\nspecies, and everybody\nwill be thin and healthy\nforever and ever.\nI'm not hopeful, because\nwe've never-- we've\nhad so many promising\ndrugs come along.\nFen-Phen, Dexedrine,\nand other things,\nwe've had so many\npromising drugs.\nAnd at the end of\nthe day, when you\ntry to muck with\nhuman metabolism using\na single processed\nmolecule, manmade,\nI can't think of even one\nexample where it's been great\nfor large numbers of people.\nCertainly,\nmanufacturing insulin is\nlife-saving for people\nwith type 1 diabetes.\nSo that would be an example.\nBut giving massive\ndoses of insulin\nto people with type 2 diabetes,\nactually is a downward spiral.\nI would much rather see people\nwith type 2 diabetes control\ntheir diabetes through\ndiet and lifestyle.\nAnd that might be a ketogenic\ndiet, or a low carb diet,\nor exercise or good sleep,\nor all of the other thing.\nAll of it.\nI'd much rather see\nthat because when\npeople try to control their\ntype 2 diabetes with a molecule,\neven though it's a\nnatural molecule insulin,\nwe know that thats results\nin really poor health\nconsequences, results\nin higher rates\nof cardiovascular\ndisease, higher\nrates of mental\ndisorders, higher\nrates of premature mortality.\nDo I think GLP-1 molecules\nare going to be different?\nNo.\nI don't have any reason to\nthink they are going to be.\nSo that would be my two\ncents, but we'll see.\nTime will tell.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will tell.\nMeanwhile, I want to\nthank you for doing\nwhat is, without\nquestion, pioneering work.\nAgain, I'm not a clinician.\nBut I've been around\nthis space long enough\nto know that indeed there\nthere are no wonder drugs.\nThere are drugs that certainly\ncan help alleviate symptoms\nin some individuals.\nBut that lifestyle and in\nthe case of your work--\nin particular, in the\ndiscussion today--\ndiet and, the ketogenic diet,\nin particular, it's clear,\ncan have incredible\neffects, miraculous effects,\nin some individuals.\nAnd positive effects\nin others that\nmight not be of\nthe same magnitude\nbut nonetheless are\nextremely important,\nso on behalf of myself, and the\nlisteners, and and certainly,\njust on behalf of everybody out\nthere-- because everyone does\nneed to be concerned about\nmental health issues,\nwhether or not they have them\nand in their family themselves.\nOr otherwise, because\nthey impact everybody.\nJust really want to thank\nyou for viewing the work\nthat you're doing because\nit really is pioneering.\nAnd it's brave.\nAnd I can see now, based on our\ndiscussion, why it would work.\nYou've given us a lot of hints\ninto the underlying mechanisms\nthat suggest as to\nwhy it would work.\nAnd you're going to\ngiven us examples\nas to how it has worked\nin patients that you've\nworked with.\nAnd this field is\nexpanding fast.\nI think this is an area\nof psychiatry and medicine\nin general.\nMeaning, behavioral,\nnutritional interventions,\nthat is expanding very fast.\nSo thank you for being brave and\nfor taking this on, and doing\nit in such a structured way,\nand for communicating it\nhere today.\nAnd with the general\npublic, through your book,\nand your online presence.\nWe will certainly point\npeople in the direction\nof those valuable resources.\nThanks so much.\nCHRIS PALMER: Yeah, I know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI appreciate it.\nCHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew,\nfor being brave and having me\non your
