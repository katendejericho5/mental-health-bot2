    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are\ndiscussing happiness.\nWe're going to discuss\nthe science of happiness,\nbecause indeed, there are\nexcellent laboratories that\nhave worked for many decades\nto try and understand\nwhat is this thing\nthat we call happiness\nand what brings us happiness\nin the short and long term.\nIn fact, we could probably\npoint to happiness\nas one of the most sought-after\nstates or commodities,\nor emotions.\nWhatever you want to\ncall it, happiness\nis what many people are seeking\nin work, in relationships,\nand in general.\nAnd yet most of us can't\nreally define exactly what\nhappiness is or means for us.\nWe can point to\ncertain experiences,\nwe can try and describe our\nstates of mind and body,\nbut most people recognize\nthe feeling when we have it,\nand we certainly recognize the\nfeeling of not being happy.\nWhether or not that means\nsimply not being happy\nas the absence of happiness\nor all-out depression.\nNow one of the key problems in\ntrying to understand happiness\nand, indeed, the science\nand psychology of happiness\nis that it does indeed\ninvolve other similar things.\nThings like joy, and\ngratitude, and meaning.\nAnd indeed, many scientists\nand psychologists\nhave argued for\nmany, many decades\nabout what happiness really is.\nNow we can come up with\nso-called operational\ndefinitions of happiness.\nOperational definitions are\nbasically agreed-upon terms\nor agreed-upon\ndefinitions and conditions\nthat will define something\nsuch as happiness.\nMuch in the same way\nthat we can all probably\ncome up with an operational\ndefinition of milk.\nBut of course, milk can be\ncow's milk, it can be oat milk,\nit can be soy milk,\net cetera, et cetera.\nSo too, something\nlike happiness can\nbe micro-divided and sliced\nand diced into as many things\nas we decide.\nToday we are really going to\nfocus on three main things.\nFirst, we are going to define\nhappiness as a brain state\nand as a state of mind and body.\nWe're going to take a look at\nwhat the science says about all\nof that.\nSecond, we are going to talk\nabout tools and practices\nfor placing ourselves\ninto states of happiness.\nAnd while for most of\nus, we think of happiness\nas something that only arrives\nthrough the acquisition\nof some goal or some thing\nexternal to us, and of course,\nthat is true.\nThere is also something\ncalled synthetic happiness\nor synthesized happiness\nwhich turns out\nto be at least as powerful and\nperhaps even more powerful.\nNow I'll just say\nright off the bat\nthat I'm not going to tell\nyou that all you have to do\nis sit in a chair and\nimagine being happy\nin order to feel happy.\nSynthesize happiness actually\ninvolves some very concrete\nsteps that have been defined by\nexcellent labs in psychology,\nso we're going to talk\nabout synthesize happiness\nas it relates to what you can\ndo to obtain happy states more\nreadily or more frequently.\nAnd then, third, we're\ngoing to talk about some\nof the misconceptions or what\nI would call the contradictions\nof happiness research.\nAnd what I mean by\nthat is most of you\nhave probably heard about\nthe general conditions\nfor obtaining happiness.\nAnd they always\nseem to circle back\nto some of the same basic\nfeatures of get great sleep,\nhave great social connection,\npursue meaning, don't focus\nto any overextend on\nthings like pursuing money\nbecause there are indeed\nthese studies that\nshow that the amount of\nmoney that people make\ndoes not necessarily scale\ndirectly with happiness.\nWe'll talk about those studies\nin some detail a little bit\nlater.\nAnd while all of\nthat literature is\nvery powerful and\ninformative, there\nis what I see as\na contradiction.\nWhich is for instance, that for\nmany of us, including myself,\nespecially in the\nyears when I was\nin graduate school\nand a postdoc,\nthere were times in which\npursuing and being involved\nin work and pursuing\ndegrees and finding\nmeaning in my vocation\nactually separated me\nfrom the opportunity\nto have quite\nas many social connections,\nor quite as much sleep,\nor quite as much exercise, or\neven quite as much sunshine,\nfor that matter.\nSo all of the things that we're\ntold that we need in order\nto access happiness\non a regular basis\noftentimes contradict\nwith the pressures\nand the requirements\nof not just daily life\nbut in building a\nlife that allows\nus to have the kind of\nresources that we need in order\nto have things like quality\nsocial connection, and the time\nand opportunity to get regular\nexercise and great nutrition,\net cetera, et cetera.\nSo, again, while this\nisn't necessarily\na complaint with any\nof the research out\nof the fields of\npsychology on happiness,\nit is important\nthat we acknowledge\nthese contradictions that\nexist in the discussion\naround happiness.\nIn particular, the\npopular discussions\naround the science of happiness.\nSo today, what we are\ngoing to arrive at,\nwhat you will\nfinish this episode,\nwith is a set of tools and a\nframework for understanding\nthe pursuit of happiness\nin the short and long-term\nas it relates to the\nresearch from psychology\nbut also the neuroscience.\nAnd my goal today is really\nto try and place that all\ninto a structured\nframework so that you\ncan know where you are in\nyour journey or the landscape\naround happiness in your\npursuit of happiness.\nAnd what I won't\ntell you is that you\nneed to abandon\nall goals in terms\nof pursuing money,\ncareer, et cetera,\nand simply focus\non relationships.\nBut we will talk\nabout what constitutes\nan excellent social bond or\neven in excellent conversation.\nThere's excellent research\nthat points to the fact\nthat even rather shallow\nconnections, that\nis, connections between people\nthat you happen to just see\nin the hallway on\na regular basis,\nnot even requiring\nclose bonds of any kind,\ncan be built into close\nbonds that can deliver\na tremendous amount of feeling\nand genuine social connection\nprovided certain\nconditions are met.\nSo today, again, it's\nreally about understanding\nthe science of happiness,\nunderstanding the mechanisms\nunderlying what\nwe call happiness.\nAnd providing you a\nframework by which\nyou can pursue and\nachieve happiness not just\nas a long-term goal and not\njust as a day-to-day goal\nof little micro exercises\nof gratitude, et cetera,\nbut rather as a way to\nthink about happiness\nas a state that you have\ncontrol over, at least\nin terms of your\nability to access\nwhat I would call\nthe algorithms that\nenable us or open the\nopportunity to experience\nhappiness.\nNow before we begin\ntoday's episode,\nI'd like to talk about a very\nspecific tool that applies yes\nto our pursuit of\nhappiness but actually\nto our pursuit of everything,\nincluding quality sleep\nand ongoing\nmotivation, et cetera.\nI've talked many, many\ntimes before on this podcast\nand on other podcasts,\nand on social media\nabout the critical\nvalue of getting\nregular bright light, ideally\nsunlight, in your eyes\nwithin the first hour of waking.\nOr if the sun isn't out when\nyou wake up in the morning,\nto turn on a lot of\nbright artificial lights\nand then get\nsunlight in your eyes\nfor anywhere from\n5 to 20 minutes,\ndepending on how cloudy it is\nin the early part of the day.\nAbsolutely outsized\neffects mood and focus\nduring the day and\nquality of sleep at night.\nNow there's another\nsort of central tenet\nof getting great sleep\nand improving mood\nand focus throughout the day.\nAnd that's to avoid\nbright artificial light\nexposure to your eyes between\nthe hours of about 10 PM\nto 4:00 AM.\nNow leaving shift workers aside,\nand we have an entire episode\ndevoted to shift work, most\npeople are asleep at night\nand awake during the day.\nAnd you would be wise to\navoid exposure of your eyes\nto bright artificial light\nbetween the hours of 10:00\nPM and 4:00 AM.\nIf you're going to use\nscreens or artificial lights,\ndim them down as far as you can.\nNow there are several studies\nthat point to the fact\nthat one of the major\nissues with getting\nbright light in your eyes\nbetween the hours of 10:00\nPM and 4:00 AM is that\nit has a negative impact\non the so-called dopaminergic or\ndopamine circuits of the brain\nand body, which can\nenhance depression.\nThat is lead to ongoing\nlower mood and affect.\nSo that's a reason\nto dim the lights\nor avoid bright lights\nbetween 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.\nHowever, I and many others\nneed to use artificial light\nand screens sometimes, even\nbetween the hours of 10:00\nPM and midnight or even\nmidnight to 3:00 AM,\ndepending on what's going\non in my life or your life.\nThat may include you as well.\nNow it turns out that\nthere are powerful ways\nto offset some, not all, but\nsome of the negative effects\nof viewing artificial lights\nbetween the hours of 10:00\nPM and 4:00 AM.\nAnd one of the most\npowerful ways to do that\nis to simply adjust\nthe overall brightness\nof your artificial\nlighting throughout the day\nand in the evening.\nSo one of the issues nowadays\nthat we're really facing\nis that people are simply not\ngetting enough bright light\nin their eyes from sunlight\nor from other sources\nduring the daytime,\nand they're getting\nfar too much bright\nlight in their eyes\nlargely from artificial sources,\nof course, in the evening\nand at night.\nNot just from 10 PM\nto 4:00 AM, but also\nin the evening hours from 6 to\n10 PM and so on and so forth.\nSo a very simple yet\npowerful solution\nthat supported by peer-reviewed\nresearch in humans\nis to try and make your\nindoor working and/or home\nenvironment during the\nday as bright as possible.\nNow, if you can achieve that\nthrough direct sunlight,\nterrific.\nIf you can get outside a lot\nduring the daytime, terrific.\nBut many people simply cannot.\nBut most people do have some\nwindows in their environment.\nI realize some don't\nbut, most people do.\nAnd as a consequence,\nmost people\nare using rather dim artificial\nlighting indoors during the day\nand then very bright\nartificial lighting\nindoors in the evening, and\nat night, that's a problem.\nAnd if you think about\nit, logically, you\nwant to do the exact reverse.\nSo it's been shown\nthat if you simply\nincrease the amount of\nbright artificial light\nthat you were exposed to\nduring the day, and remember\nthis is not an excuse to not get\nyour morning sunlight viewing,\nbut in addition to that, to make\nyour indoor artificial lights\nvery bright, bright,\nbright, bright, bright\nthroughout the day.\nAnd then much dimmer from the\nhours of 6:00 PM until bedtime.\nOr if you can't do\nthat, then maybe as soon\nas you get home from about\n8:00 PM until bedtime.\nAnd then dim them way,\nway down between 10:00\nPM and 4:00 AM or off entirely.\nThat's going to be\na far better pattern\nfor your sleep-wake\ncycles, focus, mood, et\ncetera than what\nmost people do, which\nis to have a few windows\nin their indoor working\nenvironment during the day and\nkeep the indoor lights rather\ndim at a time when they\nneed more photons, more\nlight energy.\nAnd then in the evening,\nwhen they get home\nbecause it's dark\noutside, they tend\nto turn the lights\nmuch brighter.\nYou actually want\nto do the reverse.\nNow there's an even\nsimpler solution,\nwhich is to get some bright\nsunlight in your eyes\nright around the time of sunset.\nIt doesn't have to\nbe exactly at sunset,\nit could be in the late\nafternoon and evening.\nBut it's been shown now\nin studies on humans,\nand I'll provide a\nlink to at least one\nof those studies,\nthat by getting\nsome bright light in your\neyes, ideally from sunlight,\nin the late afternoon\nand evening.\nAnd, of course, the timing will\nvary depending on time of year\nand where you are\nlocated on the planet.\nBut facing the\nsun around sunset,\nyou don't actually have\nto see the sun cross down\nbelow the horizon,\nbut facing the sun\naround that time for anywhere\nfrom 5 to 10 minutes or even\nless, even two to\nfive minutes, can\nadjust the\nsensitivity of neurons\nin your retina that communicate\nlight information to the brain\nand make it such that in\nthe evening when you use\nartificial lights, they\naren't going to have as much\nof a detrimental effect\non your dopamine system\nand for impairing your sleep.\nSo the idea is as much bright\nlight, ideally from sunlight\nbut also from artificial\nsources, from the time\nyou wake up in the\nmorning until the evening.\nMaybe around 6:00 or 7:00.\nMaybe in the summer\nmonths, a little bit later.\nAnd then really try and\nget as little bright light\nin your eyes as you can in the\nevening and nighttime hours.\nAnd ideally, you would also get\nsome sunlight exposure right\naround the time of sunset\nor in the late afternoon.\nGo outside, take\nyour sunglasses off.\nDon't try and do this through a\nwindshield or through a window.\nIt will not work.\nYou have to get outside.\nIf you're under an\noverhang, at least\ntry and get some direct sunlight\nin your eyes at that time.\nAnd that will adjust\nthe sensitivity\nof your retina such that\nbright artificial lights\nor artificial lights\nof any kind that you're\nexposed to in the evening and\nin the late hours of the night\nwon't have as much of\na detrimental effect.\nThat said, if you\ngo to the bathroom\nin the middle of the night,\ntry and keep the lights dim.\nMany people have asked\nwhether or not, for instance,\na nightlight or a flashlight\nis going to have as much\nof a negative effect.\nThis is very straightforward.\nIf you think about it, if you\nshine a light at something,\nyou can see into\nyour environment.\nIf you've ever been\ncamping or you've\nwalked with a flashlight,\nyou can see things around you\nthat you wouldn't\notherwise, of course.\nBut if you were to shine\nthat light in your eyes,\nit would be far brighter.\nSo yes, of course, if you get\nup in the middle of the night\nand you can use your phone\nflashlight to illuminate\nthe environment that you're\nin so that you can safely\ngo to where you need to\ngo and then back to bed,\nthat's going to be far better\nthan turning on the lights\nor, of course, shining\nlight in your eyes, right.\nSo the idea is bright,\nbright, bright in the morning\nand throughout the day.\nAnd as dim and dark\nas possible at night.\nAnd that afternoon light\nviewing provides, sort of,\nwhat I call a Netflix\ninoculation that\nwill allow you to adjust\nyour retinal sensitivity\nand give you a little bit\nmore flexibility in terms\nof allowing some\nnighttime light exposure\nwithout the detrimental effects.\nNow I realize today's\nepisode is about happiness,\nit's not about\nsunlight or dopamine.\nAnd yet, as we'll\ntalk about more\nin just a moment, if you're\nnot optimizing your sleep\nand if you are using or\nbeing exposed to light rather\nat the wrong times of\nthe day/night cycle,\nthat is going to make it\nvery hard for the other sorts\nof practices that\nrelate to happiness\nto have their full impact.\nSo the backdrop, where I would\nsay the kind of landscape\nof your chemicals\nand your hormones,\nis powerfully controlled by not\njust the brightness of light\nbut the timing of light\nand your exposure to light.\nIn particular, your exposure\nto light to your eyes\nis something that you have\na lot of control over.\nYou don't have absolute control,\nbut you have a lot of control\nover.\nAnd it's been proven that\neven these small steps, which\nare completely cost-free.\nThey require just a\nfew minutes of time,\nbut no purchase a\nproduct or anything else\ncan allow you to greatly\nadjust your neurochemistry\nand your hormones in the\ndirection of better mood,\nbetter sleep, and happiness.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nfor the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd as I've said many times\nbefore on this podcast,\nI am not a fan of\nthe word nootropics\nbecause it means smart drugs.\nAnd frankly, there are no\nspecific neural circuits\nin the brain or body for\nbeing quote-unquote smart.\nThesis understands\nthis, and they've\ndeveloped custom nootropics\nthat are designed\nto bring your brain and\nbody into the state that's\nideal for what you\nneed to accomplish.\nThey use the highest\nquality ingredients,\nthings like\nphosphatidylserine, alpha GPC,\nmany ingredients\nthat I've talked\nabout before on this podcast\nand that I happen to use myself.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor over a year now,\nand I can confidently say\nthat their nootropics have\nbeen a game changer.\nFor me, I like their\nnootropic for clarity.\nI used that before\ncognitive work often.\nAnd I like their\nnootropic for energy.\nAnd I often used\nthat before workouts.\nIn particular, workouts\nthat are especially intense.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nTake their 3-minute\nquiz, and these\nwill send you four\ndifferent formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAgain that's\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nAnd use the code\nHuberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help me better\nunderstand your body\nand help you meet\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health\ncan only be analyzed with\na quality blood test.\nOne of the problems with a\nlot of blood tests and DNA\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get information\nback about lipids and\nlevels of hormones\nand levels of metabolic\nfactors and so on,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker has a very\neasy-to-use online site where\nyou can monitor your levels.\nAnd you can click on\nany specific marker,\nany specific hormone,\nor metabolic factor,\nand it will tell you the\nbehavioral tools, for instance,\nexercise, the nutrition tools,\nand the supplementation-based\ntools that you can\nuse in order to bring\nthose numbers into\nthe appropriate ranges\nfor your immediate and\nlong-term health goals.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plan.\nAgain that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix makes\nmattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nI started sleeping on a Helix\nmattress well over a year ago,\nand it's been the best\nsleep that I've ever had.\nOne of the things that makes\nHelix mattresses so unique\nis that they match the\ndesign of the mattress\nto your unique sleep needs.\nSo, for instance, if you\ngo on to their website,\nyou can take a brief quiz.\nIt's only takes about\ntwo or three minutes.\nAnd you'll answer\nquestions like do\nyou tend to run hot or\ncold throughout the night.\nOr whether or not you sleep\non your back, your side,\nor your stomach, or\nmaybe you don't know.\nRegardless, they will match you\nto the custom mattress that's\nideal for your sleep needs.\nFor me that was the\ndusk D-U-S-K mattress.\nWhich, for me, was not\ntoo firm, not too soft,\nand was ideal for\nmy sleep patterns.\nYou take the quiz,\nand you'll find out\nwhat mattress is ideal\nfor your sleep patterns.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their brief sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to\na customized mattress.\nAnd you'll get up to $200 off\nany mattress order and two\nfree pillows.\nThey have a 10-year warranty.\nAnd you get to try\nout the mattress\nfor 100 nights risk-free.\nAgain, if you're\ninterested, you can go\nto helixsleep.com/huberman for\nup to $200 off and two free\npillows.\nLet's talk about happiness.\nThis thing that everybody seems\nto want, and yet not everybody\ncan agree on what exactly\nit is or how to get it.\nNow I want to start by quoting\na previous guest on the Huberman\nLab podcast.\nAnd that is a colleague of mine\nat Stanford School of Medicine,\nDr. Karl Deisseroth, who's both\na bioengineer and a clinician.\nThat is, he's a psychiatrist\nwho spends a lot of his time\nboth running a laboratory\nand seeing patients,\nhuman patients, of course.\nAnd I once was at\na meeting where\nI heard Karl say something\nto the extent of we\ndon't know what\nother people feel.\nIn fact, most of the\ntime, we don't even\nreally know how we feel.\nAnd while that\nstatement was meant\nto report several different\nthings about the way\nthat the brain\nworks and emotions,\net cetera, one of the things\nthat he was emphasizing,\nand I know he was emphasizing\nit because he confirmed\nthis for me, was the\nfact that language.\nThings like the word\nhappiness, or joy, or meaning,\nor pleasure, or delight,\nare actually not\nvery precise when it comes to\ndescribing our brain and body\nstates.\nSo, for instance, if I tell\nyou I'm feeling pretty happy.\nI know what that means for\nme, at least in this moment,\nbut you don't really\nknow whether or not\nit means the same thing as what\npretty happy means for you.\nIf I say I'm extremely\nhappy and I have a big grin.\nI have a grin on my face that I\ncan't seem to wipe off my face.\nWell, then, you might get a\nsense of how much happier I\nam than pretty happy.\nBut it's still hard to calibrate\nmy level of internal state\nor happiness, and the\nsame is true for you\nand for everybody else.\nAnd it's important for\nus to acknowledge this\nbecause at this point\nin human history, 2022,\nwe don't really\nhave a measurement\nlike body temperature or\nheart rate or heart rate\nvariability or even a way\nto measure neurochemicals\nin the brain and body\nthat give us anything\nbetter than a crude correlate\nor an estimate, at best,\nof what happiness is.\nSo that's really important to\nunderstand and to keep in mind\nthroughout this episode.\nIt doesn't mean that we cannot\nhave a strong data-driven\nconversation about happiness\nand what brings us to a state\nof happiness.\nBut it's very important to\nunderstand that language is not\nan ideal and maybe even\na deficient tool in terms\nof describing our emotions and\nour states of mind and body.\nNow equally important\nis to understand\nthat while we do have\nneurotransmitters,\nthat is, the chemicals\nthat are released between\nneurons, nerve cells\nthat allow neurons\nto communicate, things\nlike glutamate and gaba,\nfor instance.\nAnd we have what are\ncalled modulators.\nThese are chemicals\nalso released\nby neurons that impact the\nelectrical firing and chemical\nrelease of other neurons.\nThings like serotonin, and\ndopamine, and acetylcholine,\nand epinephrine.\nNeuromodulators and\nneurotransmitters\nare always present in a\ncocktail in our brain and body.\nThat is, they are present\nin different ratios\nand at different levels.\nSo we need to completely\ndiscard with the idea\nthat any one neurotransmitter\nor any one neuromodulator\nis solely responsible\nfor a state of happiness\nor for a lack of state of\nhappiness, for that matter.\nThat said, it is true\nthat for people that\ntend to have lower baseline\nlevels of, for instance,\ndopamine, their\nlevels of happiness,\nor we should say their\nself-reported levels\nof happiness, tend to\nbe lower than for those\nthat have greatly elevated\nbaseline levels of dopamine.\nNow, this can be\nbest appreciated\nat the extremes\nwhere, for instance,\nin conditions like\nParkinson's disease\nor other conditions where\npeople's levels of dopamine\nin their brain is\nseverely depleted.\nMind you, we also see this\nin drug-addicted individuals\nthat are in a withdrawal state\nbecause they're trying to quit\nor they don't have access to the\ndrug that normally stimulates\nrelease of dopamine.\nThink the cocaine addict\nwho can't get cocaine.\nOr the methamphetamine\naddict that\ncan't or is trying to avoid\ntaking methamphetamine.\nOr the Parkinson's patient\nwho has fewer dopamine\nneurons because\nthey degenerated.\nThose individuals do tend\nto be more depressed.\nThey tend to have lower affect.\nThey are less happy.\nAt least, that's how they report\nthemselves to be emotionally.\nAnd that's what we observe when\nwe look at them behaviorally\nin terms of the amount of\nsmiling, the amount of energy\nthey seem to have.\nAt the opposite extreme.\nAnd while still focusing\non the kind of pathology\nof neurotransmitter and\nneuromodulator systems,\nan individual who is in\na manic phase of bipolar\nwill tend to have very\nelevated levels of dopamine.\nAnd those people will\ntalk a mile a minute,\nand they won't require sleep.\nAnd at least to them, every\nidea is an exciting idea and one\nthat they want to pursue.\nWe did an entire episode about\nbipolar depression, A.K.A.\nBipolar disorder.\nSo if you'd like to learn\nmore about that, please\ncheck out that episode.\nThat and all other\nepisodes of the podcast,\nof course, you can find it\nhubermanlab.com in all formats.\nBut the point here is\nthat very low levels\nare very high levels of\ndopamine are correlated\nwith certain states of,\nfor instance, low happiness\nor the absence of happiness.\nWe could even call it\ndepression in some cases.\nOr extreme happiness\nor even euphoria.\nSometimes even\ninappropriate euphoria,\nas is the case with\nbipolar depression\nor sometimes called bipolar\nmania or bipolar disorder.\nNow, of course, there's a range\nin between depressed and manic.\nAnd most people, fortunately\nreside somewhere in that range.\nAnd it is indeed a continuum.\nAnd I think it's safe to\nsay that levels of dopamine\nprobably do correlate\nwith levels of happiness.\nBut there is no\none single chemical\nnor chemical signature, that is,\nno specific recipe of two parts\ndopamine, to one part\nserotonin, to one part\nacetylcholine that we can\nsay equates to happiness.\nIndeed there's now\ntremendous controversy\nas to whether or not,\nfor instance, having\nlower levels of\nserotonin is actually\nthe cause of depression\nor merely correlates\nwith depression or maybe\ndoesn't even correlate\nwith depression, at all.\nThis became especially\ncontroversial\nbecause, in the last year,\nthe so-called serotonin\nhypothesis of depression has\nbeen called into question.\nAnd indeed, it does seem to be\nthe case that for individuals\nthat are depressed,\ntheir levels of serotonin\ncan sometimes be normal.\nHowever, and this is\nan important however,\nthat does not mean that\nadministering drugs\nthat increase levels of\nserotonin in depressed people\ndoes not sometimes\nand indeed often help\nameliorate some\nof their symptoms.\nAnd I should mention that many\nof the selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors.\nSo-called SSRIs such\nas Prozac and Zoloft,\net cetera, are still\nconsidered excellent treatments\nfor conditions like OCD\nand so on and so forth.\nBut what I'm trying to do is\nmake two important points.\nFirst of all, that language\nis not a great indicator\nof internal state.\nEspecially when trying to\nunderstand other people's\ninternal state.\nAnd that is especially true\nfor things like happiness.\nAnd that there is\nno one chemical\nsignature of happiness.\nThere's no one neural\nmodulator or combinations\nof neuromodulators\nthat we can say\nis the cocktail for happiness.\nBut, and it's a very\nimportant, but when\nlevels of dopamine\nand serotonin tend\nto be chronically\nlow for an individual\nbelow their typical\nbaseline, they\nwill, yes, tend to\nbe lower in affect\nand have lower mood and less\nepisodes of happiness per day,\nper week, per month,\nper year, et cetera.\nConversely, when an\nindividual has elevations\nin dopamine and\nserotonin levels,\nin particular dopamine levels\nand the other so-called\ncatecholamines, which include\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.\nSo the catecholamines are\ndopamine, epinephrine,\nand norepinephrine.\nThey're all very\nsimilar biochemically.\nThey all lead to states of\nelevated motivation, energy,\nand so on.\nWhen those chemicals are\nelevated above baseline,\npeople do tend to have elevated\nsense of mood and well-being,\nand in particular\nsense of possibility\nabout what they\ncan do in the world\nand what the world\ncan offer them.\nSo we need to acknowledge\nthose two features of language\nand neurochemistry as we\nwade into the discussion\nabout the psychology\nof happiness.\nAnd, in particular, about\nthe controlled experiments\nthat have been done in\nexcellent laboratories focused\non the psychology of happiness\nand what brings happiness\nand what does not.\nThere have been some excellent\nstudies on happiness.\nAnd these come in\ntwo forms generally.\nOne form of these\nstudies is individuals\ncome into a laboratory.\nThey participate in an\nexperiment over the course\nof a day or months.\nAnd then, data are\ncollected analyzed,\nand the papers are submitted,\nand published, and discussed.\nThe other form is so-called\nlongitudinal study.\nWhere individuals come\ninto the laboratory,\nand they are studied over\na very long period of time.\nRanging from months to years\nand sometimes even decades.\nAnd then, the variables of\nage, life circumstances,\nand other factors can be\nincorporated into the data.\nAnd typically, there\nare multiple papers,\nthere's data published\nthroughout the longitudinal\nstudy, or sometimes\nit's just one paper\nat the end of the\nlongitudinal study.\nLet's talk about one of\nthe more famous and perhaps\nthe longest-running\nlongitudinal study on happiness.\nThis is a study that was\ninitiated or conceived\nin 1938 at Harvard University.\nThe so-called Harvard\nHappiness Project.\nSome of you probably\nheard about this.\nIt involved Harvard\nCollege sophomores\nand other individuals who were\nincorporated into this study\nas well.\nIt's a study that initially\nhad more than a couple\nof hundred subjects.\nBut because some have\neither dropped out and not\nbeen able to be contacted and\nmonitored over time or died,\nor for whatever reason,\nare no longer participating\nin the study, they're very\nfew of these individuals left.\nAnd yet there's tremendous\npower to a study like this.\nIt's such an impressive study,\nand we're all so grateful\nthat laboratories\nat Harvard decided\nto initiate and continue\nthis study because it\nis one of the few studies,\nperhaps the study that\nhas allowed us to understand\nhappiness in our species\nover a very long period of time.\nLike any study,\nit's not perfect.\nIt didn't include a\nlot of matching by sex\nor matching by\nvocation, or matching\nby income and background.\nAnd back then, there was\nalso a lot less discussion\nabout trauma and\nhistories around trauma,\nas well as positive\nepisodes in people's lives.\nNonetheless, there's a lot of\npower in a study like this.\nAnd there are some\nvery basic takeaways,\nsome of which you may have heard\nbefore but some of which may be\nsurprising those\nof you who haven't.\nSo one of the key\nthings about the study\nis people in the\nstudy, at least those\nwho still have intact memory,\nwhich many of them do,\nare able to think\nback on not just\ntheir previous year or week but\n10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50\nyears ago and compare\nwhat makes them happy\nat one age versus another age.\nA number of things have\nemerged from that conversation.\nSo I just want to discuss\nsome of the highlight points\nthen we'll get into\na little bit more\nof the nitty-gritty of the data.\nFirst of all, it's been\ndiscussed many, many times\nthat the total amount of\nincome that an individual makes\nor has, and again, this\ncould be income from work,\nor it could be money\nthat they inherited,\ndoes not seem to directly relate\nto their level of happiness.\nNow a lot of people take\nthat point and think,\noh, money doesn't matter.\nOther people hear that point\nand think to themselves,\nyeah, right, easy to say\nif you have a lot of money.\nWe'll talk about the\ninterpretation of those data\nin just a few minutes.\nBut I do want to\nearmark that finding.\nBecause I agree that while\nmoney or total resources itself\ndoes not predict happiness\nin any kind of direct way,\nthat is not the\nsame thing as saying\nhaving very few resources will\nmake you happier, of course.\nI don't think anyone\nwould imagine that.\nBut it also tends to overlook\nan important point, which\nis something that I certainly\nhave learned to appreciate\nin my life and something\nthat I especially appreciated\nwhen I was a student\nand post-doc, which\nis the following.\nPeople will say money\ncan't buy happiness.\nAnd we'll talk about the buy\naspect of that in a moment.\nAnd indeed, that's true.\nIf you look at this\nlongitudinal study or you\nlook at other\nstudies that are done\non a more short-term basis.\nOnce people get past a\ncertain level of income\nrelative to their cost of\nliving, the amount of happiness\ndoes not scale with that income.\nThat is, for every\nadditional $1,000 or $10,000\nthat they earn,\nthey don't report\nbeing that much happier\non a daily basis.\nNow that said, I venture the\nargument that while money truly\ncannot buy happiness, it\nabsolutely can buffer stress.\nAnd in particular,\nit can buffer stress\nin the form of the\nability to purchase or pay\nfor goods and services,\nand in particular services.\nYou're not going to tell\nme that having children\ndoesn't involve some\nincrease in the demands\non your life, less\nsleep, and more demands.\nAnd it certainly is\nthe case that if you\ncan hire help to clean.\nYou can hire nannies\nif that's your thing.\nYou can hire help to assist\nwith babysitting or even night\nnurses if you're having trouble\nsleeping that will literally\nallow you to sleep while\nthey take care of your child\nin the middle of the night.\nOften give excellent care.\nOne hopes excellent care.\nThat that won't offset\nsome of the stress\nassociated with lack of sleep.\nSo there are a million\ndifferent examples\none could give of this, but\nI certainly experienced this\nduring graduate school.\nIn fact, I experience both\nsides of the equation here.\nI made very little money\nas a graduate student.\nI had essentially no savings\nwhen I started graduate school,\nand I made very little money.\nThe amount doesn't\nmatter at this point,\nbut I could just barely\nafford rent and my food.\nI actually opted to live in the\nlaboratory a lot of the time.\nAnd by doing that,\nI had more money\nto spend on other things\nthat were important to me.\nNow I did not have a\nfamily at the time,\nand so I was able to do that.\nSomething that not\neveryone can do.\nBut I made very little\nmoney, but at the same time,\nI was in laboratory\nall the time,\nand that's where I wanted to be.\nAnd so my level of\nstress was actually\npretty low because\nI was investing\nall my time and energy\ninto the very thing\nthat I knew would eventually\nhelp bring me more resources.\nWhen I moved from being a\ngraduate student to a postdoc,\nfor instance.\nA postdoc is generally a\nthree to five-year period.\nIt's sort of like\nresidency in medicine,\nwhere you're no\nlonger taking courses,\nbut you continue to do research.\nIn fact, entire new\nlines of research\nand prior to getting\na professorship.\nMy income went up slightly,\nwent up by about 30% to 40%.\nBut because of where I moved\nand because of the times,\nmy cost of living went way,\nway up and I was extremely\nstressed.\nSo it wasn't my\nabsolute income, it\nwas my absolute income\nrelative to my cost of living.\nThe other thing that\none needs to consider\nwhen considering income versus\ncost of living is there's\nalso this notion of peer group.\nAnd we're going to talk\nmore about social bonds\nand connections later.\nBut one thing that\nI noticed when\nI moved from being a\ngraduate student to a postdoc\nwas I was a graduate student in\na small town where I had access\nif I chose to participate\nin most, if not all,\nof the social gatherings because\nthey were all very low cost.\nPeople tended to aggregate\nat the farmer's market\non Saturday.\nMost people wouldn't even\npurchase anything, at least not\nthe graduate students\nwouldn't purchase anything.\nIt was just a\nplace to aggregate.\nPeople sometimes play\npickup games of soccer\nor just hang out\nhave a cup of coffee.\nThere was a volleyball\ngame on Fridays.\nSometimes people would go\nout to eat that evening,\nwhich of course, costs\nmoney, et cetera,\nbut it was relatively\nlow cost of living.\nAnd social connections and\npeer group interactions\nwere all generated around\nthe same fairly low-cost\nactivities.\nWhen I transitioned to being\na postdoc, I made more money,\nbut cost of living went up.\nBut in addition to\nthat, my peer group\ntended to want to engage in\nthe same kinds of activities\nthat people in that larger\ncity were engaged in.\nSo peer group has a tremendously\npowerful influence on\nwhether or not we gauge\nthe amount of money\nthat we have as bringing\nus happiness or not.\nAnd that really speaks to\nthe critical importance\nof social interactions\nand certain kinds\nof social interactions,\nin particular.\nNow, if any of that was unclear,\nwhat I'm basically saying is\nit's not just about being\nable to pay your rent.\nIt's also about\nbeing able to access\nthe kinds of social interactions\nthat you deem are quote-unquote\ncorrect for you at\nthat stage of life\nand in the place where\nyou happen to be living.\nBecause if you can meet all\nthe demands of costs of rent\nand paying your power\nbill and food, et cetera,\nbut you are socially\nisolated because your peer\ngroup, or those around you\nthat you want to engage with,\nare engaging in activities that\nyou either don't have time for,\nliterally, because\nyou're doing other things\nor that you don't have the\nfinancial resources for,\nthen that can actually\nseverely impact this rating\nof what we call happiness.\nWhy am I parsing\nthis so finally?\nWell, I'm parsing and finally\nbecause I think that most of us\nhave heard the outcome of\nthis study from Harvard\nor the more short-term\nstudies, also many of which\nare from Harvard.\nWe'll talk about the\njust phenomenal work\nfrom Dan Gilbert's laboratory\nand other laboratories who have\nfocused on issues like these.\nAnd I certainly don't\nwant to take anything away\nfrom those results.\nThey're very powerful\nand important results\nthat really point over\nand over to the fact\nthat people's happiness does not\nnecessarily scale with income.\nIn fact, it tends not\nto past a certain level,\nand yet I think\nwe'd be remiss, I\nthink actually it\nwould be inappropriate\nfor me to say that the amount\nof income that one makes\nis not important.\nBecause if the amount of\nmoney that you happen to have\nor are making does\nnot allow you to meet\nyour basic needs of shelter,\nhealth care, et cetera.\nAnd/or doesn't\nallow you to access\nthe kind of social interactions\nthat can renew and reset\nor, I would say,\ndirectly enhance\nthe kind of neurotransmitter\nsystems and hormones\nthat lead us to feel that\nwe are happy in our life\nand we're having quality\nsocial connections, well then\nthat's very stressful.\nAnd this brings me back to\nthe statement I made earlier,\nwhich is, indeed, money\ncannot buy happiness,\nbut it certainly\ncan buffer stress.\nAnd one of the ways\nthat it buffers stress\nis by allowing options\nof different kinds\nof social interactions.\nOptions of different\ntypes of recreation\nthat one can engage in to access\nnew forms of social interaction\nand so on and so on.\nSo we need to be a little bit\ncareful or at least nuanced\nabout this statement that\nmoney can't buy happiness\nand that the data support\nthe fact that wealth\ndoesn't determine happiness.\nI think there is a truth\nto that but there's\nanother side to that, I think\nis less often acknowledged\nand that certainly\nI've experienced\nand that I think many of\nyou out there have probably\nexperienced as well.\nOne other major finding of\nthe Harvard longitudinal\nstudy on happiness, as well\nas shorter-term studies\non happiness, is\nthat much as you've\nheard, perhaps that no\none on their deathbed\nsays they wish they had\nworked more, well indeed,\nthe total amount of time\nthat one spends working\ndoes not seem to\ndetermine one's happiness.\nAnd yet I also want to earmark\nthat result as one that we need\nto parse a bit more carefully.\nBecause work, last\ntime I checked\nand certainly for me,\nis the way typically\nthat people earn an income.\nAnd as we just talked\nabout a moment ago,\nincome is often a way\nthat people have access\nto or provide access\nfor their family\nto things like\nrecreation that opens up\nthe opportunity for more\nsocial connection, right.\nSo we have to be careful with\nhow we interpret these blanket\nstatements that have become\nvery popular that money doesn't\ndetermine happiness and that\nthe amount that you work\nisn't going to\ndetermine happiness.\nIt certainly is the case\nthat if you earn more money\nfrom working more and\nthat money is devoted\nto things that bring\nmore opportunities\nfor social connection\nor for buffering stress\nin other areas of your\nlife, including health care,\ncare for your children,\ncare for yourself,\nrecreation, other things\nthat you enjoy, well then\nI think it's a little bit naive\nto assume that work itself is\nsomehow counter to happiness.\nWhich, of course, it isn't.\nAnd it especially isn't if we\ncombine that feature of work\nwith another important feature\nof the human psyche, which\nis this notion of meaning.\nNow in the\nnot-too-distant future,\nwe will do an episode of\nthis podcast on meaning\nand what constitutes meaning\nin a given endeavor, work\nor otherwise.\nBut much of the psychology of\nthe last century, and still\ntoday, focuses on this\nfeature of meaning\nas a critical one in terms\nof what makes us happy\nand what doesn't make us happy,\ncertainly in the long term.\nAnd I can certainly\nsay for myself\nthat learning and teaching, and\ndoing research in my laboratory\nbrings me tremendous feeling\nof meaning and happiness.\nSome people consider\ntheir work simply\na way to gain a paycheck,\nand other people\nfind that they would do the\nvery work they do regardless of\nwhether or not they were paid.\nIn fact, many people will do\nvolunteer work and other forms\nof work for zero money.\nSo this idea that\nmoney isn't important\nor that work is not as\nimportant as we deem it to be,\nthat also needs to be\nconsidered from a number\nof different perspectives.\nAnd again, by no\nmeans am I trying\nto undermine the data of\nthese impressive studies, both\nthe longitudinal and\nshort-term studies,\nbut I think we do have to be\ncautious in our discussion\nof results like these\nbecause the internet is\nreplete with conversations\nabout the big factors that\ndetermine happiness.\nIt's going to be social\nconnection, not income.\nIt's going to be\nthe amount of time\nthat you are able to have open\nthinking and creativity, which\nI think is an essential feature\nof happiness, by the way.\nPhysical health.\nIn particular, one's\nability to stay mobile\nand to be able to access\nthe kind of daily activities\nthat one needs to\naccomplish unassisted\nis a strong correlate of\nhappiness and so on and so on.\nAnd, of course, there are\nthe basic physiology factors.\nThe things that feed back\nonto our overall feelings\nof well-being.\nAnd I've talked\nabout these before,\nand we'll just put these\nquickly into a bin.\nYou can think of this\nas a toolkit of things\nthat you and everyone really\nshould be constantly trying\nto access, if not optimize, on\na regular basis because they\nraise the tide or\nwhat I would call\nthe buoyancy of\nyour overall system,\nmeaning your brain and body.\nAnd that would be getting\nsufficient deep sleep at least\n80% of the nights of your life.\nAnd ideally, the remaining\n20% you're not getting deep\nsleep or as much of it\nbecause of positive events.\nQuality nutrition.\nQuality social interactions.\nAnd we will define that\na little bit better.\nIn fact, we will define that\nin a lot of detail later\nin this episode and\nactually how to get better\nat creating quality\nsocial interactions,\neven very brief\nsocial interactions.\nSo we have sleep,\nwe have nutrition,\nwe have social interactions.\nWe have purposeful\nwork, whether or not\nit's paid work or non-paid work.\nAnd, of course, there\nare things like exercise\nand maybe relationships to\npets and things of that sort.\nAnd there are a\nfew others as well.\nAll of those are known to\nincrease your overall state\nof well-being, that\nputs you in a position\nto access more meaning\nand happiness, et cetera.\nBut for most\npeople, I think it's\nfair to say that\nearning a living.\nAnd earning a living by working\nis the typical way in which\nwe spend most of our time.\nSo I think we need to\nput a special bracket\naround those activities.\nAnd it's something we will\nreturn to a little bit\nlater in terms of trying to\nunderstand how periods of life\nin which there are big\nor extensive work demands\nor extensive family\ndemands on us\nare indeed compatible\nwith states of happiness\nor frequent states of happiness\nand how better to access those.\nRather than simply say\nmoney isn't important\nor the amount of time at\nwork really isn't important.\nThat's not what people are\ngoing to pay attention to.\nIn fact, I don't know how\nI will feel on my deathbed.\nHow could I?\nHuman beings are pretty\ngood about understanding\nhow they feel in the present.\nIf not describing it, they\nare pretty good at feeling it\nif they have any sense\nof internal state.\nThat is interception.\nAnd you could have some idea\nof how you feel in a moment.\nWe're pretty good about\ndescribing our past feelings,\nat least in broad\ncontour, but we are not\nvery good at projecting how\nwe will feel in the future.\nAnd in fact, that's\na theme that's\ngoing to come up\nagain and again today.\nNonetheless, what we do know on\nthe basis of really solid data\nare that certain aspects\nof our well-being\ntend to change\nacross our lifespan.\nNow lifespan is\nsomething that we\nneed to consider from\nalso a bit of nuance\nbecause humans are indeed\nliving longer and longer.\nAnd if we look at\nthe data on happiness\nacross the lifespan dated maybe\n30 or 40 years back or even\n20 years ago, it is\nconsistently described\nin that literature as a\nso-called u-shaped function.\nWhere people in their 20s\nreport being very, very happy,\nbut as time goes on and they\nacquire more responsibility.\nSo typically, getting\nmarried and having\nchildren in their mid to late\n20s and 30s and into their 40s.\nHaving more work\ndemands, et cetera,\nhappiness tends to be\nrated lower and lower,\nat least in those\nprevious studies.\nAnd then happiness tended\nto increase as people\napproach their 50s and 60s.\nAnd they tended to retire,\nand their work demands\nwere shed from\nthem, and they were\nable to enjoy the small things\nof life despite the fact\nthat, in general, I\nwould say almost always\npeople's health is not as\nvigorous when they're 70\nas it is when they're 20.\nThere are exceptions\nto that, of course.\nOf course, you can adjust the\nrate of cognitive and physical\ndecline.\nBut in general,\npeople in their 20s\nfeel more physically\nand mentally vigorous\nthan they do in their\n60s and 70s, in general.\nThat u-shaped function\nthat I just described still\nholds true today,\nbut of course, there\nhave been some major shifts\nto the general life stages\nand when people undergo\nthose life stages.\nFor instance, many people are\ngetting married much later.\nMany people are opting\nto not have children.\nIn fact, if you look at the data\non whether or not people have\nchildren or not and how\nthat relates to happiness,\neveryone will tell you that\ntheir kids are their greatest\nsource of joy, at least most\npeople will tell you that\nand are a tremendous\nsource of happiness.\nIt's obvious.\nKids are delightful, and\nraising kids while hard\nis a wonderful experience.\nIf you look at the\nratings of happiness\namong people that elected to not\nhave children versus those that\nhad, most people\nwho have children\nreport their overall\nlevels of happiness\nas lower than that of people\nwho opt not to have children.\nNow there are a lot of ways\nto interpret those findings.\nAnd by no means am I encouraging\npeople to not have children.\nThat's a issue that you have\nto resolve for yourself,\nof course.\nBut we could imagine,\nfor instance,\nthat people who opt\nnot to have children\nhave more income to devote\nto things more focused\non themselves or their partner\nor other aspects of their life.\nWe don't know if that's\nthe underlying reason.\nWe could perhaps\nconclude that people\nwho opt not to have children\nare getting more sleep\non a regular basis or have\nmore time for exercise\nor the other sorts of\nthings that elevate\nstates of mood and well-being.\nAgain we do not know\nwhat the underlying\nreasons are for this finding.\nBut it does seem that\ndespite most every parent\nreporting that their kids are\ntheir greatest source of joy\nand quote-unquote\nhappiness in life\nthat people who opt not to have\nchildren are at least as happy\nor report being at least\nas happy or even happier\nthan those that opt\nto have children.\nAnd, of course, I\nwant to be very clear\nthat I'm not trying to\nsettle any arguments about\nwhether or not people\nshould have children or not.\nI happen to find children\nand animals delightful.\nAnd I'm always happy when\npeople opt to have children\nprovided they are taking\ngood care of their children\nor doing their very best to take\ngood care of their children.\nSo that's my stance.\nBut of course,\nyou're all entitled\nto your own stance on this.\nThere are also the\ngeneral arguments\nthat people like to have\nabout whether or not\nthe population of the Earth will\nbe sustained or not sustained\nbased on current birth\nrates, et cetera.\nIndeed many areas of the world,\nbirth rates are going down.\nIt is actually\nsomething that just\nas a perhaps point\nof interest has\nbeen studied from the somewhat\nunusual but logical perspective\nof whether or not child diapers\nare selling at the same rate\nas they were some years ago and\nwhether or not adult diapers\nfor the elderly are being sold\nat the same rate or greater.\nIf you think about it is one\nindirect measure of whether\nor not people are living longer\nand/or opting to have children.\nDefinitely in discussion\nfor another time,\nprobably for another\npodcast entirely.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens,\nnow called AG1, is\na vitamin-mineral\nprobiotic drink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still take\nAthletic Greens once or usually\ntwice a day, is that it\ngets me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3K2.\nAgain that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3K2.\nSo this u-shaped function\nof people being happier\nearlier in life\nand then reporting\nfeeling far less happy\nand then happiness\nreturning to them, that is,\nthe rising of the u again\nin their later years, is\nsomething that I do believe\nshould be repeated\nin modern times.\nAnd repeated in a way that\ntakes into account that you\nmight be shifted to the right.\nThat is, I am certainly\naware that people are\ntending to get married later.\nMany are opting to\nnot have children.\nSo, for instance, the\nquestion arises whether or not\nthat u-shaped curve\nshould have a bump down\nat the bottom of\nthe u among those\nthat opt not to have children.\nBecause the argument was made in\nthe discussion of those papers\nthat the reason why\nhappiness is lower\nwhen people are in\ntheir 30s, 40s, and 50s\nis because they're devoting more\ntime to raising their children\nand devoting more time to work.\nI would hope people\nwould enjoy their work,\nbut not everybody really\nenjoys their work.\nAnd many people, even if\nthey do enjoy their work\nand they find\nmeaning in it, still\nfind it stressful,\nwhich certainly\ncan run counter to happiness.\nNowadays, you could imagine\nthat because a number of people\nare opting perhaps to work\nless or to not have children\nor both, where they\nfind tremendous meaning\nfrom their work\nthat there would be\na bump at the bottom of that\nu among those that decided to\nsimply not take on these\nadditional responsibilities.\nThat would be an\ninteresting test,\nI think, of whether or not the\ntotal load of responsibility\nis really what's correlating\nwith reported happiness or not.\nNow one very consistent\nfinding that has absolutely\nstood the test of time, and\nit's kind of an interesting one.\nIt's a little bit of a\npop psychology finding,\nbut I think it points to\nsomething interesting that we\nwill return to\nagain and again is\nthat people tend\nto report feeling\nlower levels of happiness,\nbelieve it or not,\non their birthday.\nAnd the argument for why\nthis is the following.\nThat typically, we\ngo through our year\nnot comparing ourselves to\nour peers terribly much.\nWe might do that\na little bit more\nwhen we're in elementary\nschool, high school, et cetera.\nWe're sort of age match,\nmaybe even college as well.\nBut an evaluation of ourselves\nto our age-match peers\nis not typically something\nthat we do on a daily basis.\nWhereas on our birthday,\nwe get a snapshot\nof where we are in the arc of\ntime, or at least in our life.\nAnd many people report feeling\nrather low on their birthday\nbecause they use that as\na benchmark or a window\ninto the things that they\nhave not accomplished.\nThe things that,\ndespite being age blank,\nthey still haven't accomplished.\nAnd so that's interesting\nbecause what it really\npoints to is two things.\nOne the extent to which much\nof our feelings of happiness\nare relative, in particular,\nrelative to our peers.\nSo there's that\nsocial aspect again.\nAnd the fact that\nmost of the time, we\nare not very good at\norienting ourselves\nin the longer arc of time.\nWe're pretty good\nat knowing where\nwe are in the arc of a\nday, or the arc of a week,\nor the arc of a month, or even\na year, but that most of us\nare not very good at\nreflecting on where\nwe are in our life arc.\nAnd, of course, most\nof us don't know\nhow long we will\nlive anyway, but we\ndo have some general sense.\nI mean, very few people\nlive past the age of 100.\nMany people live to be 70 or 80.\nAnd again, life span\nis extending as far\nas we know from year to year.\nBut, in general, people report\nthat on their birthdays.\nAnd I should say these\nare for birthdays\naged 25 or later, at\nleast in the studies\nI was able to access.\nI don't think that a\nlot of three-year-olds\nsit around comparing themselves\nto other three-year-olds\nand how well they're\ndoing or 12-year-olds.\nYou can imagine some people\nmight do that at 18, et cetera.\nBut it's really by the\nmid-20s that people\nstart evaluating\nthemselves to their peers\nin terms of life progression\nand so-called milestones.\nIt's been argued that that's\none of the reasons why people\nreport lower affect,\nlower levels of happiness\non their birthday.\nSomething that's a little\nbit counterintuitive.\nAnd, of course, there\nare things that are\nanti-correlated with happiness.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't\nmention a few of these.\nThat's longitudinal study,\nthe Harvard happiness project\nhas reported, for\ninstance, that people that\nare chronic smokers of\nnicotine and chronic\nconsumers of alcohol, in\nparticular alcoholics.\nThat is, people who\nsuffer from alcoholism\nor what sometimes is called\nalcohol use disorder that\nis strongly anti-correlated\nwith happiness.\nAnd I should also mention\nthat the family members,\nand in particular,\nthe romantic partners\nof people who are chronic\nsmokers and the partners\nof people who are chronic\nalcohol users, often\nwill report lower\nlevels of happiness.\nEspecially if they\nthemselves are not\nchronic smokers or regular\nconsumers of alcohol.\nSo we've done episodes on\nnicotine in particular,\nand that touched on\nsmoking, of course.\nAnd we've done an\nepisode on alcohol\nand the effects of\nalcohol on health.\nAgain, you can find\nthose at hubermanlab.com.\nThis study from the\nHarvard happiness project\nreally has strong\ndata supporting\nthe fact that avoiding\nbeing a nicotine smoker.\nThere are positive health\neffects of nicotine\nthat are discussed in\nthe episode nicotine.\nBut being a-- but smoking\nnicotine, in particular,\nis counterproductive for\npeople's at least self-reported\nhappiness and certainly\noverall health.\nI think there's zero question\nthat smoking increases\ncancers of different kinds.\nAnd that alcohol consumption.\nAnd in particular, alcohol\nconsumption beyond two\ndrinks per week.\nTwo drinks being the\ntypical volume of a beer,\na glass of wine or\ncocktail, et cetera,\nis detrimental for\nvarious aspects of health.\nAnd, of course, there\nare other things\nthat you could imagine would\nrelate to a lack of happiness.\nFor instance, a major trauma.\nPhysical or emotional trauma.\nThat could include the loss\nof a major relationship,\na death of a close one.\nBeing the victim of a violent\ncrime and things of that sort.\nAnd yet it's been argued, in\nfact, strongly argued that when\nyou look at people's levels\nof happiness after a trauma,\nthat if you wait\nabout a year or so,\nsometimes is even as\nshort as three months\nafter a trauma, that\npeople self-reported levels\nof happiness are not\nsignificantly lower than they\nwere prior to the trauma.\nNow I very much want to\nhighlight, underline, and bold\nand asterisks that\nstatement as one\nthat we really need\nto explore carefully.\nBecause there are other data\nthat strongly point to the fact\nthat major life\ntraumas can severely\ndisrupt one sense of\nhappiness and well-being.\nAnd I think as long as we're\ngoing to have this discussion,\nwe should point to a useful\ndefinition of trauma.\nAnd the definition\nthat I'll paraphrase\nis one that was supplied by a\nformer guest on the Huberman\nLab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti,\nwho's a psychiatrist who's\nwritten a book called Trauma.\nI personally think it's the\nbest book on trauma and tools\nfor alleviating trauma.\nIt's incredibly thorough, easy\nto read, and well-informed.\nAnd here again,\nI'm paraphrasing,\nbut Dr. Conti describes trauma\nas something that fundamentally\nchanges the way that our\nbrain and body function\nin a way that makes\nother aspects of living\nmore challenging.\nAgain, an event, either\nemotional or physical,\nor both, that fundamentally\nchanges the way\nthat our brain and/or\nbody, our nervous system,\nand other organs function\nin a way that prevents us\nfrom enjoying daily activities.\nAnd that could even be\nongoing distraction.\nTraumas can create\nrumination, or they\ncan create obsessive thought,\nor they can create dissociation.\nAny number of different things.\nAgain check out that\nepisode with Dr. Paul Conti\nif you'd like to learn\nmore about trauma\nand how it manifests.\nBut the idea that's\nbeen put forth\nby a number of researchers\nin the field of happiness\nthat three months after\na major trauma, people\naren't reported that they\nare feeling any less happy\nthan before the trauma,\nthat was surprising to me.\nSo I went into this\nliterature a bit more deeply.\nOne of the basis of that\ngeneral line of thinking\nis a-- what I consider a now\nclassic and very important\nand frankly excellent\ntalk that was\ngiven by Professor Dan Gilbert\non the science of happiness.\nYou can find this on YouTube.\nI say a classic one because\nit was done some years ago.\nIt's received millions of views.\nAnd one of the points that\nhe makes in that talk which\nis grounded in\nresearch carried out\nby his laboratory and other\nlaboratories is that--\nhe poses a question.\nHe says you know,\nlet's do a quiz.\nWould you rather be someone\nwho wins the lottery\nand he shows a picture\nof somebody who just won,\nI think it was several\nhundreds of millions of dollars\nin the lottery, or was\nrecently made paraplegic lost\nuse of their legs?\nAnd then goes on to\nstate that one year\nafter people have\nwon the lottery,\nthis major monetary windfall\nversus have become paraplegic\nis that their self-reported\nlevels of happiness\nare the same.\nWhich I think is\nincredibly surprising.\nI heard this, and I immediately\nthought of an experience\nthat I've had where I\nteach a course at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine on\nneural regeneration.\nAnd it's actually a course\nthat I attended some years\nago when I was a\npost-doc at Stanford,\nso well over a decade ago.\nAnd we had-- excuse me.\nWe had an individual\ncome into the course.\nThis was an older gentleman.\nSo older meaning he\nwas in his early 70s.\nAnd he had become paraplegic\nfairly late in life\nfrom a cycling accident.\nAnd he was and is\nan expert in what\nit is to become a\nparaplegic, of course,\nbecause he had that experience,\nbut also because he spends\na lot of his time doing\nvolunteer work with people who\nhave become paraplegic\nand have become paraplegic\nat different ages.\nAnd what he described to me\nwas that the overall outcomes\nfor people that are\nrendered paraplegic\nin terms of their mental health\nand their physical well-being\nand their management\nof general life skills\nscales with how early\nthey had that injury\nand how long they had\nthe use of their limbs.\nSo it's not straightforward.\nWhen I heard this result\ndescribed by Dr. Dan Gilbert,\nthat winning the lottery\nand becoming paraplegic\nbasically don't impact\nyour levels of happiness\nto any different degree when\npeople look back a year later,\nI was pretty surprised\ngiven my experience\nof hearing this\nlecture at Stanford.\nSo I thought, wow,\nfrom what I understand.\nIndeed, there are people\nwho are rendered paraplegic\nand manage that\ntransition very easily.\nIt doesn't seem to disrupt\ntheir feelings of well-being,\net cetera, but for\nother people, it\ncan be severely disrupting\nto their sense of well-being\nand so on and so forth.\nI went back and\nexamined these data.\nAnd in fact, a\nsubsequent talk, it's\nactually a podcast that\nwas given by Dr. Dan\nGilbert some years later.\nSo this would be\njust a few years ago.\nI think in 2019-- there\nis a specific date\nin which it was recorded\nbut just a few years ago.\nAnd indeed, he corrects\nhimself in that podcast.\nWhat he says is that he\nmisspoke in that earlier talk.\nThat the difference in\nself-reported levels\nof happiness for those that\nhave been rendered paraplegic\nfor versus those who've won the\nlottery is not as great as one\nwould expect.\nI think most people would expect\nthat being rendered paraplegic\nwould make people\nfar less happy.\nThat's the expectation,\nI think, anyway.\nAnd that people would\nwin the lottery,\nat least for some\nperiod of time,\nwould be far happier\nthan they were\nprior to winning the lottery.\nAnd especially given the\ntremendous amount of money.\nAnd again, the fact that\nmoney can't buy happiness,\nbut that money does\nindeed enable the ability\nto buffer stress\nprovided people were\nresponsible with\nthat money and just\ndidn't blow it or spend\nit all right away.\nThat they could start\nto afford things\nthat they couldn't afford, not\njust in terms of luxury items\nbut also the\nability to hire help\nthat would free up time that\nwould allow them to do anything\nfrom travel that they couldn't\naccess before to meditate\nif that was something that they\ndidn't have time to do before.\nAnd so on and so forth.\nSo the result quote\nunquote that winners\nof the lottery and\nrecent paraplegics\nhave the same levels of\nhappiness is actually not true.\nAt least according to the\nauthor of the original study.\nNow what he did not point to is\nthe degree to which that is not\ntrue, but he did point to\nthe direction of the result.\nAnd the fact that people who are\nrendered paraplegic, in fact,\nare reporting\nthemselves as less happy\nthan they were prior\nto their injury.\nAnd certainly that their\nlevels of happiness\nare lower than those that\nsimply won the lottery\nhundreds of millions of\ndollars, which I think\nis the more intuitive result.\nAnd so I think it's important\nto be aware of that discrepancy\nbecause it's something\nthat was lost\nin the communication\naround those results\nthe first time around.\nAnd indeed, Dan Gilbert\nis an excellent scientist\nand was quite good about trying\nto correct the narrative.\nI myself, as a podcaster\nwho puts information\non the internet, know that\nthe challenges of correcting\nnarratives, especially of things\nthat came out some time ago,\nwe always attempt to\ndo this as best we\ncan, but not everyone that\nsaw that first video will\nnecessarily hear the discussion\nthat has happened subsequently.\nSo my hope is that Dr. Gilbert\nwill interpret me communicating\nthis now not as an\nattempt to criticize him\nbut rather as an attempt\nto praise his willingness\nto try and correct the\nnarrative to be more accurate.\nSo to be very clear about what\nthis study did and didn't show.\nAnd here, I'm going to\ncombine these results\nwith other studies\nthat I was able to find\nthat explored\nsimilar phenomenon.\nSo major trauma, for instance.\nNot necessarily becoming\nparaplegic but traumas\nof a different sort,\nemotional traumas.\nWhen you look at the whole\nof those data, at least,\nmy read is that when people win\nthe lottery or acquire wealth\nthrough inheritance, some\nform of wealth acquisition\nthat is sudden and that wasn't\npreceded by a specific effort\nto gain that wealth, right.\nBuying a lottery ticket\nis a pretty quick thing.\nInheritance is something\nthat you simply\nget by virtue of who you are,\nnot necessarily by effort.\nWell, that led to increases\nin self-reported happiness\ncompared to prior to the\ninheritance of the lottery win,\nbut it wasn't as\nsubstantial as you\nmight imagine if\nyou are approaching\nthe notion of\nhappiness simply from,\nwell, more money\nequals more happiness.\nAnd while it is true that people\nwho are rendered paraplegic\nor who undergo psychological\ntraumas or physical traumas\nof any various kind\nare, and frankly,\nare remarkably\nresilient in many cases.\nThey can still manage to\ngo about life and work\nand engage in\nrelationships, et cetera.\nThere is a visible decrease\nin overall levels of happiness\nand well-being,\nin particular, if\nthe psychological\nand physical trauma\nrenders their nervous system\ndifferent in a way that\nimpacts other major areas of\nlife and enjoyment for them.\nAnd that's certainly true\none year out from the trauma.\nSo the point is that\nwe do need to reframe\nthis idea that whether or\nnot you win the lottery\nor become paraplegic or\nsuffer some major trauma,\nyour levels of\nhappiness are going\nto be the same three\nmonths or a year later.\nI don't think that's accurate.\nAnd in fact, Dr. Dan\nGilbert emphasized\nthat that's not accurate\neven in that initial study.\nAnd I think it's\nan important thing\nto frame because that's\nsuch a popular notion.\nOr that that idea\ncombined with the idea\nthat increased earnings\ndon't make us happy\ncombined with the idea that\nwe are happy early in life\nbut then as more demands arise\nin life, we become less happy,\nand then we become happy again.\nAnd that idea is\nwe already explored\nis not necessarily true.\nFrankly, I knew a lot\nof teenagers and people\nin their early 20s that\nare pretty unhappy who\nthen become happier later as\nthey acquire more resources.\nSometimes distance,\nlet's be honest,\nsometimes distance from\nour family of origin\nmakes us more happy,\nsometimes less so.\nIt's highly individual.\nSo I think those general themes\nthat we've heard over and over,\nwhile they have merit and\nthey certainly stand up\nin some of the more\npowerful longitudinal\nand short-term studies, there\nis nuance, and in some cases,\nthere are now additional\ndata that are causing us\nto revise those understandings.\nNow there is an\nimportant point, or I\nshould say the important\npoint, that we can really\ncredit Dan Gilbert and others\nin the field of psychology with\nand that we owe them a\ngreat debt of gratitude\nfor is that we do\nhave far more control\nover our levels of happiness\nthan we might think.\nAnd many of the\nthings that reside\nat that level of control.\nThat is, the things that we can\ndo and think and say and access\ndon't come from external things.\nThey don't come necessarily\nfrom the acquisition of material\ngoods, but rather\nthere are things\nthat we can do that can allow\nus to so-called synthesize\nhappiness.\nAnd I think this is\none of the great gifts\nof modern psychology is that--\nDan Gilbert and others, the\nHarvard happiness project,\nwork at Yale and elsewhere.\nThere are excellent labs working\non happiness all over the US\nand all over the world, frankly.\nOne of the great gifts\nthat they've supplied us\nin the form of data\nis that there really\nare things that we can all\ndo and think and access\nto allow ourselves to\nso-called synthesize happiness.\nNow, this notion of\nsynthesizing happiness,\nor synthetic happiness\nas it's sometimes called,\ncan sometimes ruffle\npeople's feathers a bit.\nBecause people immediately\nflip to the idea\nthat, oh, you're\njust going to tell\nme to be grateful for what\nI have or to just navel\ngaze or just to\nimagine that I'm happy.\nBut that's really not\nwhat synthetic happiness\nis about at all.\nSynthetic happiness\nactually has to do\nwith some really important\nlarger principles about the way\nthat our emotional\nsystem and the way\nthat the reward systems of\nour brain really function.\nAnd they point to\nimportant concepts\nthat we're going to now discuss.\nThings like the hedonic\nset point, for instance.\nOr the dopamine\nsystem of anticipation\nof rewards versus receiving\nwords just as a brief insight\ninto that.\nOur anticipation of\nsomething positive\noftentimes leads to\ngreater increases\nin the sorts of\nneurochemicals that\nsupport a state of\nhappiness and well-being\nthen the actual\nacquisition of the thing\nthat we're trying to obtain.\nAnd this goes back\nto a theme I've\ndiscussed a few times\nbefore in this podcast,\nin particular with my colleague\nat Stanford School of Medicine,\nDr. Anna Lembke, who wrote the\nfabulous book Dopamine Nation.\nIf you're interested in\ndopamine and addiction,\nin particular, that's\na wonderful clear,\nand extremely informative read.\nAnd if you're interested\nin dopamine more\ngenerally, not just in\nthe states of addiction\nbut in everyday life and\nin pursuit and motivation,\nThe Molecule of More is an\nexcellent book related to that.\nAnd as I mentioned\nearlier, we have\nthis episode on dopamine\nmotivation and drive.\nThe notion of\nsynthetic happiness\nis not simply about\nimagining happiness,\nor thinking about happiness\nor anticipating happiness.\nTo some extent, it is,\nbut it relates to a number\nof other important themes.\nBut it is grounded\nvery thoroughly\nin the neurobiology\nof dopamine rewards.\nAnd I'll talk about some of that\nneurobiology in a few moments.\nBut I want to take\na couple of minutes\nand talk about what\nsynthetic happiness is\nand what some of\nthe conditions are\nfor allowing us to\naccess the state\nof so-called\nsynthetic happiness.\nAnd I want to point\nout at the outset\nthat synthetic happiness, while\nit might sound synthetic A.K.A.\nfalse, it's anything but.\nIt actually turns out to be\namong the more and perhaps\nthe more potent\nform of happiness\nthat we can all access.\nAnd this is where themes\nrelated to our control\nover our own\ninternal state really\nbecome not only valid\nbut very powerful.\nSo, for instance, Dr.\nDan Gilbert and others\nhave explored how opportunity\nand choice, that is, freedom\ncan and can't lead to\nstates of happiness.\nAnd the results of those studies\nare very solid and, frankly,\nvery surprising.\nUntil you understand the\nresults, and once you do,\nI think you will immediately\nsee areas of your own life\nthat you can start to\naccess more happiness, again\ngenuine happiness,\nsimply by framing\ncertain choices in\na particular way\nand maybe even by\neliminating choices.\nNow I'd like to focus\non the research aimed\nat understanding what increases\nour levels of happiness.\nAnd I'd like to frame this\nunder the umbrella of two\nmajor themes.\nThe first theme is\nso-called natural happiness.\nNatural happiness is the sort\nof happiness that most of us\nare familiar with.\nSo the kind of\nhappiness that we expect\nto have if we, for\ninstance, complete a degree.\nHopefully, a degree in a topic\nmeaningful and interesting\nto us but a degree nonetheless.\nOr we find a mate.\nHopefully, a mate that we\nenjoy spending time with.\nOr, for instance, making a\ncertain income or finding\nwork that we enjoy\non a regular basis.\nAll of those are\nforms of happiness\nthat, from a very early\ntime in development,\nwe are taught exist.\nFor instance, even\nwhen we are very young,\nwe are told that our\nbirthday is coming\nand that we are going\nto get presents,\nand those presents\nare going to be\nfocused on knowledge of\nthings that we already enjoy.\nSo if you're a little\nkid, and you like trucks,\nor you're a little kid\nand you like dolls,\nyou can sort of expect that\nthose gifts will bring you\nsome level of joy or happiness.\nAnd while that's a\nsmall child example,\nthat general notion\nof natural happiness\nis, of course, one that\npersists into adolescence,\ninto young adulthood,\nand into adulthood.\nAnd we quite understandably\ncome to associate\nthis feeling of joy or happiness\nwith the receiving of things\nor the acquisition of\nthings, whether by effort,\nby gift, by inheritance,\nor some other form.\nSo that's natural happiness.\nAnd yet, as I mentioned\na little bit earlier,\nthere's also this notion\nof synthetic happiness.\nAnd some of the more interesting\nand exciting research\nin the fields of psychology\nand, in fact, neuroscience\npoint to this idea of\nsynthetic happiness\nas at least as powerful\na source of happiness\nas natural happiness.\nAgain, at least as powerful\nand perhaps even more powerful.\nAnd of course, one has to take a\nslightly different view of what\nhappiness is in order to accept\nthis idea that we can create\nhappiness for ourselves,\nbut that doesn't mean\nthat the whole notion\nof synthetic happiness\nis merely a passive\none where all we\ndo is sit back and imagine being\nhappy and then we are happy.\nFor better or for worse,\nour nervous systems\nand our neurochemistry\nsimply don't work that way.\nIn fact, synthetic\nhappiness has almost always\nbeen understood as\nsomething that we\nhave to put some effort\ntoward achieving.\nBut, and this is an\nimportant thing to point out,\nsynthetic happiness\nalso requires\nthat certain situational\nor environmental conditions\nbe met.\nA good example of this is some\nof the work by Gillian Mandich,\nor I should say Dr.\nGillian Mandich, who's\ndone some interesting work on\nthe conditions for creating\nhappiness within our mind and\nin our overall state of being.\nAnd she's been involved in a\nnumber of different studies.\nBut one of the ones that I\nfound particularly interesting\nis one in which they explored\ndifferent types of music\nand other aspects of\nenvironmental settings.\nSo you bring subjects\nto the laboratory\nplay them different\ntypes of music.\nThere are, in fact,\ncertain aspects of music\nthat can create different\nstates of mind sadness,\nhappiness, anticipation.\nIn fact, there are\ncertain patterns of music\nthat can reliably induce\nanticipation of the fear\nand anxiety base type.\nSo, for instance,\nthink the movie Jaws.\nIf you recall, for those\nof you who have seen Jaws,\nthere's this ongoing\ntheme music any time\nthe shark might be present in\nthe water or in a given scene.\nThat essentially goes [HUMMING]\nNow for the musicians\nout there, this\nhas basis in things\nlike tritones and things\nthat are understood\nfrom the mathematics\nand the musical side.\nAnd from the\nneuroscience side, are\nknown to create a neural\nstate of anticipation.\nYeah, a neural state\nof anticipation\nand not necessarily\na positive one.\nAnd indeed, there are\nother patterns of music\nthat involve up tones.\nThink some of the music\nthat's typically been used\nin cartoons of various sorts.\nThere's a long history of this.\nIndeed there's a\nwhole literature\nof psychological and now even\na smaller but still interesting\nliterature on the\nneuroscience of how\ncertain patterns\nof music can induce\na state of joy and joyful\nanticipation, in particular.\nA lot of those patterns\nof music are incorporated\ninto so-called happy\ncartoons and Disney movies\nand things of that sort.\nIn any case, Dr. Mandich and\nothers have explored how music,\nin particular, but other\nfeatures of the environment can\nor cannot induce\nstates of happiness.\nAnd the basic takeaway\nfrom those studies\nis that while having a\ncertain environmental sound,\nmusical tone, or visual feature\nto a given space, a room,\nis necessary for a\nstate of happiness,\nit is not alone sufficient.\nWhat is required is that\nindividuals not only\nbe placed into an\nenvironment that\ncontains music or visual items\nor a combination of music\nand visual items that\ncan induce states\nof joy or happiness or\npositive anticipation,\nbut that they also are given\nsome sort of instruction\nor instruction manual as\nhow to synthesize happiness\ninside of that environment.\nThis is important\nbecause what this\nsays is that our ability to\ncreate states of happiness\nis dependent on our environment\nbut also requires effort\nfrom us.\nThat also makes sense as to why\nwhen we are under conditions\nof deprivation.\nSo it could be\nsocial deprivation\nor financial deprivation.\nOr even for people that are\nvery sensitive to whether.\nThere are a certain number\nof individuals, about 30%\nof people, who report feeling\nvery, very low under conditions\nwhere the sky is overcast.\nEspecially if it's been\novercast for a number of days.\nThe so-called seasonal\naffective depression.\nThose individuals,\nby the way, can often\nreceive tremendous\nbenefits in terms\nof elevating their mood if they\nmake an effort to get sunlight.\nAnd if they can't get sunlight,\nartificial light of the sort\nthat we talked about earlier.\nBut in any case,\nthere are a number\nof people that are profoundly\nnegatively influenced\nby the lack of positive\nvisual and auditory cues\nin their environment.\nBut for most people,\nwe are in what\nI would call a\ndynamic relationship\nwith our environment.\nOur environment has\nan effect on our mood.\nBut the research\nindicates that we also\nneed to make some sort of\neffort toward being happy.\nNow effort toward being\nhappy is a very vague term.\nSo let's better\ndefine what that is.\nIn the case of Dr.\nMandich's work,\nthis took the form of\ndoing so-called happiness\ninventories, right.\nThat can be focusing on things\nthat one is grateful for,\nthings that they\nparticularly enjoy.\nThis is somewhat of a\ngratitude-type practice\nbut includes some\nother features as well\nthat are more focused\non the things that\nbring you meaning and actually\nengaging in the things\nthat bring you meaning.\nSo if you're trying\nto think about how\nto improve your levels\nof happiness, what\nthis research essentially\nsays is that you would\nbe smart to try and adjust\nyour home environment,\nadjust your work environment\nso that it is cheerful to you.\nMaybe that means a plant.\nFor me, in my laboratory,\none of the things\nthat was really critical\nthat I had as a postdoc\nand in my own laboratory when\nI first started my lab was I\nlove aquaria.\nSo I had multiple fish tanks.\nIn fact, people in my laboratory\nwere always rolling their eyes.\nWhy do we have to have all these\nfish tanks with all these--\nI like freshwater tanks,\nnot saltwater tanks,\nfor reasons that\naren't interesting\nfor this discussion.\nBut freshwater tanks with discus\nfish, for instance, to me,\nare just beautiful.\nThey make me happy.\nI just enjoy them.\nMusic is a complicated\nthing in laboratories\nbecause it's a shared space.\nSo headphones are the\ngeneral requirement.\nBut having either silence\nif you love silence.\nAnd I happen to like\nworking in silence\nor listening to\ncertain forms of music.\nI do also use the 40\nHertz binaural beats.\nOr I particularly like listening\nto Glenn Gould while I work\nor listening to whale\nsong, believe it or not,\nwhile I work because it doesn't\nhave any structure that I\ncan follow.\nI don't speak whale,\nand so I can't follow.\nBut it sort of fills the space\nin a way that I find pleasant.\nAnd I've put substantial\namounts of effort\ninto making my laboratory\nspaces and my office\nspaces, my workspaces,\nnice places to be.\nNow I had no\nknowledge of this work\nfrom Dr. Mandich and others\nat the time when I did that.\nBut what I found was\nthat over the years,\nI was challenged in maintaining\na kind of elevated mood\nwhile working in a laboratory,\nnot because I didn't thoroughly\nenjoy the work, I love doing\nexperiments with my hands,\nand I loved being in lab, but\nat least the labs that I was\nin as a graduate student\nand post-doc there\nwere no windows so I wasn't\ngetting adequate sunshine.\nThe windows that we\ndidn't open, so I\nwasn't getting a lot of fresh\nair, and so on and so forth.\nSo I've personally\nfound it very valuable\nto create an environment\nboth at work and at home\nthat I find aesthetically\npleasant, at least in some way\nor another.\nAnd I realize people\nhave varying levels\nof control over their\naesthetic environment.\nCertainly, the\nauditory environment\ncan be controlled nowadays\nthrough the use of headphones\nif you're allowed to use those.\nSo, for instance, using music\nor using background sound\nthat you find very\npleasant combined\nwith a concerted\neffort on your part\nto create states of happiness\nby hopefully doing work that's\nmeaningful to you or at least is\nleading to meaningful outcomes.\nWe'll talk a little\nbit more about that.\nBut these happiness\ninventories also\nturn out to be interesting and\nimportant sources of creating\nso-called synthetic happiness.\nAnd we'll also talk\nabout other ways\nthat one can create elevated\nlevels of synthetic happiness.\nAnd I realize the word\nsynthetic probably\ndraws up connotations\nof false happiness\nor contrived happiness.\nI wish instead of calling\nit synthetic happiness.\nThey had called it\nself-created or self-directed\nhappiness or something of\nthat sort because then it\nwouldn't sound as false.\nBecause it's simply not false.\nIt leads to the\nsame, as far as we\nknow, identical neurochemical\nand psychological states\nof happiness as\nnatural happiness.\nAnd might even be\nmore persistent\nthan natural happiness.\nIt certainly, is more\nunder our control.\nBut the key point\nis that environment\nand self-directed work at\nbeing happy are both important,\nand they interact\nwith one another.\nSo if you're somebody who\nhas a hard time synthesizing\nhappiness through\nany of the methods\nthat we talk about today, don't\nconsider yourself deficient.\nIt could very well be that the\nenvironment that you're in,\nsocial environment or\nphysical environment,\nor auditory environment,\nis simply not\nconducive to\nsynthesizing happiness.\nAnd for that reason,\nI think the work\nof Gillian Mandich and\ncolleagues and others\nin the field is tremendously\nimportant because it removes us\nfrom this pressure to\njust synthesize happiness\nfrom within despite\nour circumstances.\nI think many of us have heard\nof the incredible stories\nof people like Viktor\nFrankl or Nelson Mandela who\nwere stripped of\ntheir freedom and yet\nmanaged to maintain some\nsense of positive anticipation\nor at least some\nsense of identity\nthat allowed them to still\naccess forms of happiness.\nThose are highly unique\nsituations, of course.\nAnd they speak to the\npower of the human psyche\nfor synthesizing happiness\nand certainly for synthesizing\na sense that there might\nbe a future and to live\ninto that future.\nIn their cases, incredibly\nimpressive ways.\nBut I think for most everybody,\nthe environment that we're in\nhas a powerful\nimpact on our mood.\nAnd some people\nmore than others.\nI know people that are perfectly\nhappy with blank walls.\nNo pictures on the walls.\nOther people\nbenefit tremendously\nfrom having photos or plants\nin their environment and so on.\nYou really have to determine\nwhat's needed for you\nand do your best\nto try and place\nthose things into\nyour environment,\nor rather, place yourself\ninto an environment that\nis conducive to you\nsynthesizing your happiness.\nIn fact, the\npowerful interaction\nbetween our environment\nand our own ability\nto generate certain\nkinds of emotions\nis well established\nnot just for happiness\nbut for things like gratitude.\nSo, for instance, there's a\nclassic study from AMES A-M-E-S\nin 2004 that was\nfocused on gratitude.\nAnd we've had an episode\non gratitude before.\nThe basic takeaway\nof that episode\nis that it turns out\nreceiving gratitude\nis a more powerful\nstimulus for the release\nof neurochemicals and activation\nof brain areas associated\nwith so-called\nprosocial behaviors\nand feelings of well-being,\nincluding happiness.\nBut also observing stories in\nthe form of movies or books\nor other narratives of\nother people receiving help\nis also a very powerful\nstimulus for gratitude.\nAlso, giving gratitude\nis very powerful but not\nas powerful as receiving\ngratitude, at least\nthat's what the research\nsays, or observing\npowerful exchanges of gratitude\nbetween other individuals.\nWhat the study\nfrom AMES showed is\nthat gratitude as a state\nof mind and as an emotion\ndoes not exist in a vacuum.\nIt's not independent\nof our surroundings.\nSo, for instance,\njust writing down\nall the things you're\ngrateful for while it\nhas some positive impact,\nthe impact of that\nor receiving gratitude\nor observing gratitude\nis far more potent, right.\nBigger increases in\nhappiness and feelings\nof well-being and indeed\nneurochemicals and activation\nof brain areas associated\nwith happiness and well-being\nwhen there's a reciprocity.\nWhen the person receiving\nunderstands something\nabout the person\nthat's giving to them\nand understands that the\nperson is giving genuinely,\nfor instance.\nSo there's an\nenvironmental interaction.\nIt's not just about\nreceiving, it's\nreceiving from somebody that you\nknow genuinely wants to give.\nAnd likewise, for the\ngiver in that equation,\nthe feelings of\nwell-being are far greater\nwhen the person\nreceiving whatever\nit is money, food, assistance\nin some form or another.\nCould be physical\nassistance, et cetera.\nWhen the giver has knowledge\nthat the person receiving it\ngenuinely needed the thing\nthat they are receiving.\nSo the important finding within\nthe research, again and again,\nis that happiness doesn't\nexist in a vacuum.\nIt's partially our\nown responsibility\nto synthesize happiness.\nYou know, I was told that many\ntimes you're like happiness\nis in your head.\nWell, yes, indeed,\nit's in your head,\nbut it's also dependent\non interactions\nwith your environment.\nPhysical environment and\nsocial environment, and so on.\nLikewise, gratitude is something\nthat we can create inside of us\nright through gratitude\nlists and appreciation,\nor we can give both\npowerful sources\nof evoking neurochemical changes\nassociated with gratitude\nand happiness and well-being.\nBut it, too, doesn't\nexist in a vacuum.\nThere's a much greater\npositive effect\nwhen we have knowledge about\nwhy the giver is giving us\nsomething or that\nthe person receiving\nsomething is going to benefit\ntremendously from receiving it.\nSo I'm highlighting\nthis because I\nthink that when we hear\nabout synthetic happiness,\nthere's a kind of automatic\nerasing of context\nthat tends to occur.\nAnd in fact, if you were to\nperuse the various videos\nonline or papers that exist\non PubMed around happiness\nand synthetic happiness,\nin particular,\nyou would come away\nwith the impression\nthat synthetic happiness\nis just something\nthat we're supposed to\nsnap our fingers in access\nor perhaps do very\nspecific things in access.\nBut while that is true,\ncontext really matters.\nAnd I think that's\nan important point.\nMuch in the same way\nthat the point needs\nto be made that while money\ndoesn't buy happiness,\nmoney can buffer stress\nand certainly offer\nopportunities that can\nprovide opportunities\nfor more happiness.\nSo I think we are starting to\narrive at a general theme here,\nwhich is that nothing related\nto our mood exists in isolation.\nAnd in fact, that leads\nme to a discussion\nof one of the major\nscientific findings\nin the realm of what sorts\nof mindsets and behaviors\ncan, in fact, lead to happiness.\nAnd this is a paper that\nwas published in 2008.\nEven though that might\nseem like a while ago,\nit forms the basis for a\nlarge amount of literature\nthat followed.\nIt's a very\ninteresting literature.\nThis is work from Elizabeth\nDunn and colleagues\nand was published in\nthe Journal Science.\nWhich, again, is one of the sort\nof three apex journals, Nature,\nScience, Cell, I always say\nis sort of the Super Bowl, NBA\nchampionships, and Stanley\nCup of scientific publishing--\nvery, very stringent in\nterms of the number of papers\nthey let in.\nVery few, that is.\nAnd the title of this\npaper makes fairly obvious\nwhat the paper is about.\nThe title of the paper\nis \"spending money\non others promotes happiness\".\nAnd I know a number of you\nprobably hear that title\nand think, oh boy, here we go.\nHe's going to tell us that\ngiving away all our money\nis going to make us happier\nthan receiving money.\nAnd I promise you, that is not\nwhat I'm going to tell you.\nBut nonetheless, this is\na very interesting study,\nand it's one that I\nthink that we really\nought to pay attention to.\nBecause what the\nstudy is based on\nis the fact that income,\nprovided one's income\nmeets a certain\nlevel of basic needs,\nindeed has been shown to\nhave only a weak effect\non overall happiness.\nOK?\nSo quoting from the paper\nin the first paragraph,\nquote \"income has a reliable\nbut surprisingly weak\neffect on happiness\nwithin nations\".\nWithin nations just\nmean they looked\nat this in not just\nthe United States,\nbut a number of other\nplaces, as well.\n\"Particularly once\nbasic needs are met.\"\nOK, so if that's the\ncase, then what aspects\nof money and having money\nare related to happiness?\nCertainly, there are people\nwho have a lot of money who\nare very happy.\nCertainly, there are people\nwho have very little money\nwho are very happy.\nAnd of course, the\nreverse is also true.\nThere are plenty of people\nwho don't have very much money\nwho are unhappy,\nand in fact, there\nare people who have a lot of\nmoney who are very unhappy.\nA point that whenever\nit's made often\nleads those with less money\nto kind of roll their eyes,\nbecause the assumption is more\nmoney does increase happiness.\nAnd in fact, it doesn't.\nAnd later, we'll get back to\nthis idea of whether or how one\nacquired their money has\nany impact on whether\nor not that money increases\ntheir happiness or not.\nLet's kind of earmark\nthat for later.\nIn the meantime, let's\ntalk a little bit more\nabout the findings\nin this paper.\nThis paper is\ninteresting, because what\nit did is it explored something\ncalled prosocial spending.\nProsocial spending\nis a phenomenon\nwhere people are taking\na certain portion\nof their income, and they\nare giving it to others.\nOften for causes or for\nthings that they think\nare important to see\nhappen in the world\nor change in the world.\nThat could be a hungry\nindividual having access\nto food or medical care.\nIt could be for\nenvironmental causes.\nIt could be for animal wellness.\nIt could be for any number\nof different things.\nIt could even be\ngiving somebody money\nso that they can buy themselves\na gift or giving somebody money\nand not having any understanding\nor expectation of what they're\ngoing to do with the money.\nAgain, one of the central\nthemes around gratitude\nis that while\nreceiving is great,\ngiving is also great in terms of\nincreasing sense of well-being.\nAnd one of the more\nimportant features to that\nis when we give, either\nin the form of words\nor in the form of\nresources, knowledge\nthat the person\nreceiving benefits\nfrom that in some\nreal way, greatly\nincreases the\nchance that there's\nan increase in happiness for the\ngiver, as well as the receiver.\nAgain, that's a note\nabout gratitude,\nbut not an insignificant one\nas it relates to the study.\nSo what the study found was\nthat higher prosocial spending\nwas associated\nwith significantly\ngreater happiness.\nThis was a very statistically\nsignificant effect.\nAnd they found that the\neffects of income and prosocial\nspending were independent\nand similar in magnitude.\nIndependent and\nsimilar in magnitude.\nI'll explain what\nthat means for those\nof you that might be confused\nby that statement in just\na moment.\nWhereas, quote, \"personal\nspending remained\nunrelated to happiness\".\nSo what this study\nbasically found\nwas if people are allotted\na certain amount of money\nto give away, and one\nadjusts for overall income,\nand this is\nimportant, because you\ncould imagine that for some\nindividual giving away $2,000\nmight represent a\nsignificant portion\nof their yearly\nor monthly income.\nAnd for another individual it\nmight represent a tiny fraction\nof their income.\nBut when you adjust for\nincome level, what you find\nis that people who\ngave away money\nbenefited tremendously in\nterms of their own increase\nin happiness.\nIn fact, quote, \"employees who\ndevoted more of their bonuses\nto prosocial spending,\nthat is giving way\nmore money, experience greater\nhappiness after receiving\nthe bonus, and the manner in\nwhich they spent that bonus was\na more important predictor\nof their happiness\nthan the size of\nthe bonus itself\".\nThis was an actual\nexperiment they ran\nwith real income, real money.\nI'm going to read\nthat again just\nto make sure it hits\nhome, because I found\nthis to be really impactful.\n\"Employees who devoted a\ngreater fraction of their bonus\nto prosocial spending, that is\ngiving away money to others,\nexperienced greater happiness\nafter receiving the bonus.\nAnd the manner in\nwhich they spent\nthat bonus was a more important\npredictor of their happiness\nthan the size of\nthe bonus itself.\"\nSo the actual bonus, the\nreceiving of the money,\nled to greater increases in\nhappiness if they gave it away.\nAnd the act of giving\nit away itself,\nled to greater\nincreases in happiness\nthan receiving the bonus.\nSo it's a twofer,\nas you might say.\nSo the takeaway from this\nstudy and studies like it,\nI think is pretty obvious that\nto the extent that we can.\nAnd again, when I say to\nthe extent that we can,\nthis means whatever\npercentage of our own income\nthat we can afford to give away,\nor if we don't have income,\nthe percentage of our effort.\nI mean this is about money,\nbut it's also about effort.\nWe can help others, right?\nYou can serve in food kitchens,\nyou can do community gardening,\nyou can pick up trash, you\ncan do any number of things.\nYou can assist a\nneighbor with child care\nor you can assist a neighbor\nwho is physically less\nable to retrieve their\npaper, et cetera, et cetera.\nThe point is that\ngiving resources,\ncertainly in the form of money,\nbut also in the form of effort\nand time, is immensely\nbeneficial for synthesizing\nour own happiness.\nThat is for the\ngiver, us, to increase\nour levels of happiness.\nBut the degree of increase\nin our own happiness\nis proportional in\nsome way to the extent\nto which the person receiving\nactually needed that help\nand registers that help.\nExcellent research\nalso points to the fact\nthat another potent\nway to synthesize\nhappiness, that is to create\ngenuine states of happiness\nin ourselves, is to leverage\nthe so-called focus system.\nOr rather, I should say to\nde-emphasize the tendency\nof our minds to wander.\nThere's an excellent paper\non this, also published\nin the Journal Science.\nThis is now a classic paper.\nI talked a little bit about it\nin the episode on meditation,\nbut for those of you\nthat did or perhaps\ndidn't hear that episode, I\njust want to briefly touch\non a few aspects of the paper.\nAnd in particular, a few aspects\nof the paper that I didn't talk\nabout previously.\nAnd the title of\nthis paper, again,\nis a very\nstraightforward in terms\nof telling you what it's about.\nAnd that is, \"A wandering\nmind is an unhappy mind\"\nby Killingsworth and Gilbert.\nThis paper was published\nin Science in 2010,\nand we will provide\na link to the paper.\nThis is frankly, a\nvery interesting paper.\nThis paper involved\nseveral subjects,\nor I should say,\n2,250 adult subjects.\nAnd what they were\nable to do was\nto contact these\nsubjects while they\nwere going about living\ntheir daily lives\nand ask them both\nwhat they were doing\nand what they were feeling.\nSome additional questions\nthat they asked them,\nbut they were able to\nestablish whether or not\npeople were watching television\nor doing housework or working\non a home computer or resting or\nlistening to music, et cetera,\nin their natural environment.\nSo this is outside\nthe laboratory.\nAnd they were able to\nassess to what extent\nthose people were happy\nor unhappy or neutral,\nor had some other\nemotional state at the time\nwhen they were engaging in any\nnumber of different activities.\nAnd they assessed whether or\nnot those individuals were also\nfocused on or focused away\nfrom whatever activity they\nwere engaging in.\nAnd the takeaways from\nthis study are many,\nbut for sake of today's\ndiscussion, what\nI think is especially\ninteresting\nis that regardless\nof whether or not\npeople were engaging in\nactivities that they enjoyed\nor not, the tendency for their\nmind to wander from an activity\npredicted lower\nlevels of happiness\nthan if they tended to be\nfocused on the activity\nthey were engaged in.\nNow that itself\nshould be surprising.\nI mean, what that says\nis that even if somebody\nwas engaged in activity\nlike cleaning their house\nor doing homework or reading\nsomething that they weren't\nenjoying, if they were focused\non what they were doing,\nthey tended to report as happier\nthan if their mind was drifting\nelsewhere.\nNow this also points to the\nidea that perhaps our minds\ndrift to unpleasant thoughts\nmore than pleasant thoughts.\nBut they also addressed\nthat in the study.\nPoint I'd like to\nmake here is quote\n\"although people's\nminds were more\nlikely to wander\nto pleasant topics\nthan to unpleasant topics\"\nand there the difference\nis pretty significant.\nPeople's minds tended to\nwander to pleasant topics\nabout 43% of the time as\nopposed to unpleasant topics\nabout 27% of the time.\nOr to neutral topics and the\nremaining 31% of samples.\n\"People were no\nhappier when thinking\nabout pleasant topics than\nabout their current activity\".\nThink about that.\n\"People were no\nhappier than when\nthinking about pleasant things\nthen their current activity\".\nIn fact, the mere focus\non what they were doing\nwas more powerful\nthan anything else,\neven if they didn't enjoy\nwhat they were doing.\nSo they go on here to say, quote\n\"although negative moods are\nknown to cause mind\nwandering, I now\nsee strongly suggested that\nmind wandering was generally\nthe cause, the\ncause, and not merely\nthe consequence of unhappiness.\"\nSo there are a lot of\naspects of this study that\nare worth going into.\nBut the major takeaway, or the\none that perhaps we should all\nbe most concerned with,\nis that when we are not\nfocused on what we\nare doing, we tend\nto be far less happy\nthan when we are\nfocused on what we are doing.\nEven if what we are\ndoing is something\nthat we don't deem\nvery pleasant.\nAnd certainly, if we\nare engaged in something\nthat we consider very pleasant\nand we are very focused on,\nwell then our levels of\nhappiness are the highest.\nThat's sort of obvious.\nBut what this really speaks\nto is the tremendous power\nof building our ability to\nfocus on what we're doing.\nAnd to stay present\nto what we are doing.\nNow this whole notion\nof staying present\nis one that itself is a\nlittle bit complicated.\nAnd in the episode on meditation\nI talked a little bit about\nwhether or not it's\nbeneficial to be\npresent to our\ninternal state, or that\nis our inter receptive state.\nOur feelings of our heart\nrate and how full or empty\nour gut feels or our state of\nbeing from our skin inward,\nor whether or not\nwe should focus\non being present to things in\nour immediate surroundings.\nBoth our versions\nof being quote,\nunquote \"present\"\nas you can imagine.\nBut in the one case,\nwe're focused internally,\nin the other we're\nfocused externally,\nand of course, most\nof the time it's\nsome combination of the two.\nBut what this study\nreally says is\nthat any practice that can\npowerfully impact our ability\nto remain present in the\nactivity we are engaged in,\ncould even be a\nphone call, could\nbe texting for that matter,\ncould be social media\nfor that matter, right?\nWe're not placing judgment\non the activity here.\nIn fact, what we're\nreally talking about\nis the enormous happiness\nincreasing value\nof being present to what\nwe're doing regardless\nof what we are doing.\nAnd a practice that's known to\nbe beneficial for increasing\nour ability to focus\nis, among other things,\na short meditation practice.\nIn fact, work from Wendy\nSuzuki's lab at NYU,\nagain, Wendy's been a\nguest on this podcast.\nHer laboratory has\nshown that even\na very brief meditation\nof about 13 minutes,\nand this would be the\nsort of quote unquote\n\"classic\" type of\nmeditation of eyes\nclosed, focusing\non one's breathing.\nEven a very brief meditation\nof just 13 minutes\nor so done consistently,\nso ideally, every day.\nBut I have to imagine that\neven if you skip a day,\nthere are still benefits.\nThat sort of\nmeditation can greatly\nenhance one's ability to focus.\nIn her studies,\nthat was also shown\nthat sort of brief meditation\ncould also greatly enhance\nmood and sleep and\nvarious aspects\nof cognitive performance.\nAnd work from my laboratory,\nin collaboration with Dr. David\nSpiegel at Stanford,\ndepartment of psychiatry\nhas shown that even briefer\nmeditations of even just five\nminutes per day can have fairly\noutsized positive effects\non a number of different\nparameters, as well.\nThose very brief\ntypes of meditations,\nbecause they really are\nfocusing and more accurately,\nI should say,\nrefocusing exercises.\nWhen you do that sort of\nactivity of closing your eyes\nand forcing yourself\nto focus and refocus\non your breath and\ninternal state,\nthat is directing your\nperception inward.\nOr if you choose, you\ncould deliberately\nfocus your perception\non some external object\nor sound, for that matter.\nWhen one does that, the circuits\nof the brain involved in focus\ndramatically improve.\nThat is they rewire and\nincrease their ability for you\nto achieve focus.\nMany of us have heard about\nmeditation, many of us\nthink about meditation as\na \"mindfulness\" exercise.\nMindfulness in quotes, because\nthat itself needs definition.\nBut I prefer to view\nmeditations of the sort\nthat I just described\nas perceptual or focus\nbased training, which is\nreally what the data point to.\nNotions around consciousness\nand states of mind\nare very hard to define, but\nit's very clear that even\na 5 minute a day or ideally,\nan up to a 13 minute a day\nmeditation can greatly\nincrease our ability to focus.\nAnd based on the\nfindings in this paper,\n\"A wandering mind is an unhappy\nmind\" also make it very clear\nthat the ability to\nrefocus again and again\nand again on what we're\ndoing throughout our day,\nregardless of what\nwe're doing, can\nhave a very dramatic, in fact,\na statistically significant\nincrease on our levels\nof overall happiness.\nSo what else does\nthe research tell us\nwe can do to increase our\nlevels of genuine happiness?\nWell, it's very clear based\non the longitudinal study\nfrom Harvard, as well\nas the Yale happiness\nproject and the work of\nnumerous laboratories in the US\nand elsewhere, that\nquality social connection\nis extremely powerful\nin terms of its ability\nto increase our\nlevels of happiness.\nWhat is quality\nsocial connection?\nQuality social connection\nfalls into a number\nof different bins.\nThis can be romantic connection,\nthis can be friendship,\nthis can even be\ncoworker or just\ndaily superficial\ninteraction type connections.\nThat's surprising\nto a lot of people,\nbecause I think a lot of people\nhear quality social connection\nand they think\ndeep conversation.\nBut it's very clear\nfrom the research\nthat oftentimes our\nconversations with people\nthat we are closest to are\nactually quite shallow.\nIf you think about it, if you've\nbeen in a romantic relationship\nor a friendship for a\nlong period of time,\nor maybe even a sibling\nrelationship or other family\nrelationship, much of\nwhat you talk about\nis fairly superficial\nor fairly trivial.\nIn fact, it's often a\nsharing of the trivial day\nto day things between two\npeople or through groups\nof people that\nleads to the feeling\nthat people are really\nconnected to one another.\nIn particular, if it's involving\nshared experiences of any kind,\ngood or bad.\nSo there's an extensive\nliterature on social connection\nand how to build\nsocial connection.\nThis certainly\nshould be the topic\nof a full episode\nof this podcast\nin the not too distant future.\nBut because social connection\ncan have such a powerful impact\non our states of happiness\nand overall well-being,\nI want to emphasize a few\nfeatures of social connection\nthat I think most people\nmight not appreciate.\nOnce again, when we hear\nquality social connection,\nI think most of us tend to\nthink about deep, meaningful\nconversation or long walks\non the beach or camping trips\ntogether or travel together.\nAnd while all of those\ncertainly qualify\nas wonderful opportunities\nfor social connection,\nopportunities for\nquality social connection\nare certainly not limited to\nthose kinds of interactions.\nIn fact, I can recall times\nin my graduate career,\nso this would be times when I\nwas living in the laboratory.\nBecause that was a significant\nportion of my graduate years.\nAnd one of the more important\nsocial connections for me\nwas the staff that worked there\nin the wee hours of the night\nand that came in very\nearly in the morning.\nSo one of the more regular\nsocial connections I had is I\nwould brush my teeth in\nthe hallway bathroom.\nAnd there was no one else\nreally around at that time,\nexcept for the\njanitors that tended\nto leave early in the morning.\nThey had worked a good\nportion of the night.\nOr that were arriving\nvery early in the day.\nAnd the fact that I would\nsee them on a regular basis\nand maybe exchange a few\nwords about their work\nor their families or the\nholidays, actually for me,\nbecame very meaningful.\nIn part, because my social\nconnections at the time\nwere really limited to\nonly social connections\nthat I had in the\ncontext of work.\nNow some people might look\nat my schedule at that time\nand look at my life at\nthat time and say, well,\nthat was very unhealthy.\nYou were lacking in\ncertain number of ways.\nBut frankly, looking\nback, and at the time,\nand I know this because\nI journaled at the time,\nI was exceedingly\nhappy, at least\nfor that stage of my life.\nAt that stage of\nmy life, I wanted\nto be focused primarily on\ndoing experiments and immersing\nmyself in my\nscientific training.\nAnd for me, the even seemingly\ninsignificant interactions\nof talking to the\njanitor in the morning\nor some of the other regular\nstaff was not insignificant.\nIn fact, for me it\nwas very significant.\nAnd over the holidays when\ntheir hours were reduced,\nI actually missed\nthem quite a lot.\nAnd even as I talk\nabout this, I can\nrecall the feelings\nof well-being\nof just seeing familiar faces.\nAnd that brings up an\nimportant point, which\nis there's quite extensive\nliterature pointing to the fact\nthat when we see faces,\nespecially faces in the morning\nand in the late afternoon,\nthere is a positive impact\non the emotional circuitry.\nOr I should say, the\ncircuitry of the brain that\nunderlies emotional well-being.\nAnd that shouldn't\ncome as surprising.\nWe as old world primates,\nmuch like other primates,\nare very dependent on faces\nand facial expressions\nin terms of registering\nour own place in life\nand our emotional state.\nNow the origins\nof this are many.\nIn particular, we\nhave a brain area,\nit's actually called\nthe fusiform face gyrus.\nThis is an area\nof the brain that\nwas largely\ndiscovered by a woman\nby Nancy Kanwisher at MIT.\nAnd the Kanwisher lab\nhas done extensive work\nshowing that this\nbrain area that's\ndedicated to the processing\nof faces, and not just faces\nin real life, but faces\non computer screens\nand elsewhere, are\nintimately tied\nto areas of the brain that are\nassociated with emotionality.\nThat's actually a work\nfrom another laboratory,\nDorsal's laboratory at\nCaltech, now at Uc Berkeley,\nhas shown that this\nface processing\narea in the brain in both\nnon-human primates and primates\nis directly linked to\nthe areas of our brain\nthat associate with\nanxiety and fear.\nBut also, areas\nof the brain that\nare associated with well-being.\nSo it comes as no\nsurprise that when\nwe see faces, in\nparticular, friendly faces,\neven if we have just brief\ninteractions with those faces,\nand even if no\nwords are exchanged,\nthat creates the\nsense of social bond.\nAnd it creates a sense\nof predictability.\nAnd I raise this again because\nI think a lot of people\nthink that social\nconnection always\nhas to come in the form of\nclose friendships, which\nof course are wonderful.\nOr close romantic relationships,\nwhich of course, are wonderful.\nOr close family relationships,\nwhich of course, are wonderful.\nBut as we'll soon discuss\nin our model of happiness,\nor how to achieve\nhappiness based\non the scientific\nliterature in a few minutes,\nsocial connection can and\nshould come in various forms.\nAnd when I say\nvarious forms, I mean\nforms of brief interaction,\nmore superficial interaction,\nand forms of deeper interaction.\nAll of those are relevant\nto our states of happiness.\nAnd there's research to\nsupport that daily interactions\nwith somebody at a cafe or\njust a brief hello or a smile.\nProvided that we\nare both present,\nor we make the effort to be\npresent to those interactions,\nhowever brief they are,\ncan have a positive effect\non people's overall well-being.\nAnd not just in that\nmoment, but consistently.\nEvidenced by the\nfact, I think, that\nwhen I look back on\nthose years of working\nlong hours in the laboratory and\nessentially restricting myself\neither to exercising,\nsleeping, eating or working.\nAgain, that's what I wanted\nat that stage of my life.\nCertainly, not the way\nI live my life now.\nBut that's what I wanted\nthat stage of my life.\nThat even those\nseemingly insignificant\nsocial interactions\nwere important to me\nand had a potent\nimpact on increasing\nmy level of happiness.\nAnd frankly, still do.\nAnd I feel that right now.\nThat said, I think all of us\ncan appreciate the immense value\nof social connection that is of\nthe more long lasting, and for\nlack of a better\nword, richer type,\nwhether or not that is with\nsiblings or with parents\nor with friends or\nwith romantic partners.\nFor that reason, I want\nto emphasize a little bit\nabout what\nconstitutes connection\nand what constitutes\nsocial connection.\nThere are basically two\nforms of social connection\nthat have been studied\nand I'll review both,\nas it relates to increasing\nour levels of happiness.\nAnd the first one is\npresence and eye contact,\nand the second is\nphysical contact.\nSo in terms of presence\nand eye contact\nthere's been a lot\nof studies about\nwhether or not people\nexchange direct eye contact\nduring conversation or not,\ndictating whether or not\neach individual in\nthat interaction\nfeels as if they\nhad a connection.\nNow again, keep in mind that\nwhile we think of connection\nas relating to some deep\nor meaningful conversation,\nand oftentimes that\ncan be the case.\nThink for instance, an excellent\ntherapist patient relationship.\nOr an excellent\nromantic relationship.\nOr an excellent friendship\nwhere you really feel\nheard and understood, or\nat least to the extent\nthat people are\nwilling to explore\ncertain topics with you.\nYou're willing to hear\nthem and listen really\ncarefully for what\nthey're saying,\nand they're willing to hear and\nlisten to what you're saying\nin an attempt to understand.\nThat certainly can enhance\nthe sense of social connection\nleading to what people would\ncall social bonds leading\nto increased happiness.\nBut eye contact is also known\nto be an important feature.\nThe thing about eye\ncontact is that most people\nassume that a lot\nof eye contact,\nand in fact,\nongoing eye contact,\nis critical to a\nsense of connection.\nAnd in fact, that's\nnot the case.\nThere's a recent paper that I\nfind really interesting that\nwas published in\nProceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences in 2021.\nThe title of this\npaper is \"Eye contact\nmarks the rise and fall\nof shared attention\nin conversation\".\nI find this paper interesting\nfor a number of reasons.\nFirst of all, my laboratory\nworks on internal states\nand vision, so it\nrelates directly\nto the work that\nmy laboratory does.\nBut also, that it\nviolates what I thought\nwas a general rule of\nsocial connection, which\nis this idea that two people\nneeded to be focused on one\nanother, that is\nlooking at one another\ndirectly and fairly consistently\nthroughout a conversation\nin order for the feeling\nof connection to emerge.\nBut it turns out\nthat's not the case.\nAnd in fact, just to give\nyou the takeaway and then\nI'll flesh it out a little bit\nwith some data, eye contact,\nor I should say mutual\neye contact, so two people\nregistering the presence of the\nother person looking at them.\nYou're looking at me\nand I'm looking at you.\nIf you're watching\nthis on YouTube,\nthen perhaps we are actually\ndoing this at that moment.\nAnd if you're\nlistening, just know\nthat I'm looking\ndirectly into the camera\nas I'm saying this\nat this moment.\nIf we were to be looking\ndirectly at one another,\nthat, it turns out,\nsignals the next step,\nwhich is that it's very likely\nthat we will each both look\naway.\nAnd that turns out to\nbe a way in which we set\nand reset attention continually\nduring conversation.\nSo again, I really\nlike this study\nbecause of the high fidelity.\nThe high temporal precision.\nThat is, the precision\nover time at which they\nlooked at eye contact and\nengagement of attention\nbetween individuals.\nAnd they did this by looking\nat things like pupil size\nand of course\nwhere the eyes were\nlooking and so on and so forth.\nThe basic takeaway of this\nstudy was the following.\nAnd here I'm quoting\nfrom the study.\nQuote \"Rather than\nmaximizing shared attention,\ngood conversation\nmay require shifts\nin and out of shared states\naccompanied by eye contact\".\nSo what this basically\nsays is that when\ntwo people are\ninvolved in a very,\nlet's call it an\nintimate conversation,\nbut the word intimate\nshould not be misconstrued\nto mean something about\nintimacy or sexual intimacy\nor physical intimacy.\nJust a conversation\nin which both people\nfeel present to the\nconversation and focused\non that conversation and that\nconversation and its contents\nonly.\nThe tendency is for people\nto take turns talking,\nalthough sometimes,\ndepending on the individuals\nthey might interrupt\nmore or less.\nAgain, interrupting can\nbe a sign of interest,\nit doesn't always have\nto be rude, by the way.\nBut they're sharing information.\nHopefully, about a common\ntopic or set of topics.\nThey will at some moment\nlook at one another.\nThat's what the study shows.\nAnd that after briefly\ngazing directly at one\nanother, attention peaks,\nand then they will look away,\nand attention will get reduced.\nAnd then the\nconversation consists\nof a series of focusing back\non one another with their eyes,\nand then focusing off,\nfocusing on and focusing off.\nAnd those mutual\neye contact moments\nactually predict the\nbreaking of attention.\nSo it's this ramping up\nof attention and braking\nof attention.\nRamping of attention and\nbraking of attention.\nI think these are important\nresults because they violate\nthis stereotype or assumption\nthat deep social connection\nof the sort leading\nto happiness always\ninvolves ongoing eye\ncontact or ongoing focus.\nJust as with meditation, just\nas with any activity, frankly,\nwe undergo shifts in\nattention and focus.\nThat is focus ramps up and\nthen it breaks, and then\nit re-engages.\nIt ramps up it breaks,\nand then it re-engages.\nAnd that, it turns\nout, is the basis\nof in-depth connected\nconversation.\nSo for those of you that\nare interested in creating\nsocial connection\nin any context,\nand in particular for sake\nof increasing happiness,\nbecause it's very clear\nthat social connections,\neven if they are fairly\nsuperficial social connections,\ncan increase our\nsense of happiness.\nSeeing faces is important.\nIdeally, faces in person,\nalthough I suppose these days,\nover Zoom or over other\nscreen type medium\nwould be a close second.\nBut the point is that if you\nwant to increase happiness\nyou need to have quality\nsocial connections.\nAnd if you want to have\nquality social connections\nyou need to be\npresent and engage\nin those social connections.\nAnd that requires a viewing\nof each other's faces,\nideally, which is not to say\nthat a phone call or text\nexchange can't be meaningful.\nBut that faces are really\nthe most powerful way\nto engage in social contact.\nAnd that eye contact, not\nconsistent eye contact,\nbut eye contact of the sort\nthat builds up and then breaks\nand builds up and breaks\nacross the interaction\nis going to be the best way\nthat we are aware of to feel\nthat one had a real connection.\nThis should also\nremove any pressure\nthat you might feel to\nconstantly look at somebody\nor to be completely eyes\nopen staring at them\nwithout blinking or diverting\nyour attention at any point\nduring a conversation.\nThis also frankly,\nis an opportunity\nwhere if somebody says, hey,\nyou're not paying attention\nbecause you look away,\nthat you may actually\nbe engaging in what is\nthe more typical form\nof healthy connection.\nI talked about this long ago\non an episode about focus.\nIt turns out when\nwe are listening\nvery intently to\nsomebody and trying\nto remember the information\nthey're telling us,\nwe will often close our eyes.\nAnd that's not a form of lack\nof attention, that's actually\na form of attending in.\nBecause we have so much of\nour brain devoted to vision.\nWhen 40% of our brain\nis devoted to vision\nin some way or another,\nwhen we close our eyes,\nwe can actually devote\nmore attentional resources\nto remembering the specifics\nof what people are telling us.\nBut again, please don't\ngo through conversations\nwith your eyes closed\nthe entire time.\nI think that would certainly\nnot be conducive to building\nsocial connection.\nSo we know that faces are\nimportant for social connection\nas it relates to\nsynthetic happiness.\nAnd we know that eye contact is\nreally important for building\nsocial connection.\nPhysical contact\nis also important\nfor social connection.\nAnd not just romantic or\nsexual type connection.\nIn fact, there is a form\nof physical connection\nthat is present\nin other primates.\nIn fact, it's present as far\nas we know, in all mammals.\nAnd is also very much a feature\nof the human nervous system.\nAnd that's something\ncalled allogrooming.\nI have to imagine that\nmost people probably\nhaven't heard of allogrooming.\nThe reason I'm\nbringing up alogrooming\nis that it stems from a\nfairly extensive literature\nabout the prosocial,\npro happiness\neffects of pets on humans.\nIn fact, if you want\nto read up on this,\nthere is a paper out of Yale\nUniversity on this topic\nthat was published in 2018.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"The influence of interactions\nwith dogs on affect\", OK\nemotion, \"anxety and arousal\nin children\".\nAnd it references\nsome other studies\nthat were performed on humans.\nAnd the basic takeaway is\nthat these so-called AAAs,\nanimal assisted activities,\nrepresent a really potent way\nto increase people,\nincluding children's feelings\nof well-being.\nNow what's interesting\nabout this to me\nis that dogs\nthemselves don't really\nhave to do much except be\npresent in the room in order\nfor these positive effects, that\nis, the reductions in anxiety,\nincreases in happiness,\net cetera, to occur.\nAnd in fact, they can\nbe very, very brief.\nAs they describe in the\npaper, \"brief unstructured\ninteractions with\nan unfamiliar dog\",\nso you don't even\nneed to know this dog,\n\"after exposure to a moderate\nstressor showed higher positive\naffect relevant to participants\nwho received a soothing object\nor waited for the\nsame amount of time.\"\nSo just even seeing a dog\nfor a brief amount of time\nhas been shown to reduce\nstress and improve happiness,\nor I should say,\nincrease feelings\nof happiness\noverall then a child\nreceiving a soothing object.\nWhich was, at least for me, a\nlittle bit counterintuitive.\nI would have thought\nthat children receiving\na soothing object\nwould have been\nthe more powerful stimulus.\nBut in fact, it wasn't, at\nleast not in this study.\nThe real question I think we\nshould be asking ourselves\nis, what is it about\ninteractions with others\nand with other animals\nthat could potentially\nhave this prosocial\nhappiness enhancing effect?\nAnd the reason I\nraise this is also\nbecause I think many people\nare interested in either owning\nor having interactions with\npets as a way to improve\ntheir feelings of well-being.\nAnd I say having\ninteractions with because I\nmyself am a good example\nof somebody who wasn't\nalways able to have pets.\nSo when I was a graduate\nstudent in a postdoc,\nI very much wanted a dog.\nVery, very, very\nmuch wanted a dog.\nIn fact, there was a rule\nin my family at some point\nthat I wasn't allowed to talk\nabout dogs anymore because I\nwas talking about all\nthe breeds of dogs.\nGoing to dog breeders,\nexamining different breeds,\ngoing to the pound, et cetera.\nThe point was that I was\nobsessed with getting a dog,\nbut I knew I wasn't in a good\nposition to own a dog yet.\nI didn't have the finances, I\ndidn't have the correct living\nsituation and so on.\nEventually, I did\nown a dog, of course.\nBut at the time I couldn't.\nSo what I would do is every\nSunday I would go to a place\nwhere they fostered dogs\nand they needed dog walkers.\nAnd I would walk their dog.\nI would also walk\nmy neighbor's dogs.\nI didn't charge them for it.\nIn fact, I felt like I was\nbeing paid by getting time\nwith those dogs.\nAnd in fact, I put an ad\nat that time on Craigslist\nthat I would walk\npeople's dogs for free,\nand only a few people\ntook that seriously.\nBut of the ones that did,\nI had a great little cadre\nof dog owners that would allow\nme to take their dogs out\nand I was super happy.\nIt just made me\nvery, very happy.\nAnd I really enjoyed it.\nAnd frankly, it was a\ngreat opportunity for me\nto also get to the various dog\nbreeds and the different dog\ntemperaments and to learn a bit\nabout my ability to interact\nwith dogs in a certain way.\nI actually got to be a\npretty good dog walker.\nUnfortunately, later\nI got a bulldog.\nAnd it turns out\nno matter how good\na dog walker you are, Bulldogs\njust simply don't like to walk.\nIn fact, if you've ever\nwalked up to a bulldog\nand you've offered to\nscratch or pet that dog,\nyou'll notice that\nBulldogs love that.\nAnd I would argue, having\nbeen a bulldog owner,\nthat they like it because it's\nan opportunity for them to stop\nmoving.\nBut that's more about\nthe bulldog than what\nI'm about to tell\nyou next, which\nis this principle of\nso-called allogrooming.\nAllogrooming is a\npattern of behavior\nthat's observed in essentially\nall mammals but very strongly\nin nonhuman primates\nand primates,\nwhere individuals within a\nspecies touch one another.\nAnd this is non-sexual touch.\nSo this would be someone\nbrushing somebody else's hair\nor combing their hair or even\nusing a lint roller on them,\nfor instance.\nOr someone grooming\nsomebody else.\nNow typically, one needs\nto have an established\nrelationship with this person.\nSo it could be a professional\ntype relationship\nwhere this is a barber\ncutting somebody's\nhair or a hairdresser cutting\nor styling somebody's hair.\nIt could be somebody\ngiving someone\na manicure or a pedicure.\nCould be somebody doing skin\ncare or massage for somebody\nin a professional context.\nOr it could be two\npeople who have agreed\nthat it is appropriate\nfor the context\nand for the relationship\nfor one person\nto be grooming somebody else.\nCan even, believe it or not\nthere's literature on this,\ncan even extend into\nthe realm of people\nsort of cleaning and\npicking off other people.\nNow when we see\nthis in primates,\nit seems like a very cute and\nsort of almost understandable\nbehavior.\nWe can see these\npictures online.\nIf you look them up, you can\njust look up allogrooming\nand you'll see vast\nnumber of pictures\nof for instance, baboons\npicking little things out\nof each other's hair.\nOr grooming and kind of\nperusing one another,\nto find things,\npresumably parasites\nor like little bits\nof plants or something\nlike that they want\nto remove from them.\nAllogrooming is\nknown to stimulate\na certain category of neurons\ncalled the C tactile fibers.\nThese are a particular category\nof so-called sensory neurons\nthat innervate our skin.\nSo these are literally like\nlittle endings of neurons,\nlittle wires that\nend up in the skin,\nthat when they are\ntouched lightly\ntend to create a\nfeeling of well-being\nin the person that's\nbeing touched.\nAgain, this is\nconsensual touch that's\nvery context appropriate.\nBut it's known to\nincrease levels\nof oxytocin, a kind of hormone\nslash neurotransmitter.\nIt's both, really.\nThat is known to evoke\nfeelings of bond.\nOr of feeling bonded to\nsomebody or something.\nAnd for many people\nwe hear about oxytocin\nand we think about the bond\nbetween parent and child,\nin particular mother\nand infant where it's\nbeen most extensively studied.\nOr between two members\nof a romantic couple.\nBut if you look at the\nliterature on allogrooming,\nwhat you find is that when\nhumans groom one another,\nthe increases in oxytocin\nthat are experienced\nare at least on par with and in\nfact, more often, more dramatic\nin response to allogrooming\nthan in response\nto other forms of touch.\nSo the point here\nis that allogrooming\nis a prosocial\nbehavior that tends\nto associate with\nand promote feelings\nof well-being and happiness.\nAnd this is not\na trivial effect.\nIf you look at the brain imaging\ndata or other forms of data\non this, allogrooming\nis a very powerful form\nof bonding between individuals\nthat's completely nonverbal.\nIn fact, most often it\ndoesn't involve eye contact.\nI suppose two people could\nbe looking at one another\ngrooming one another,\nbut typically, this\nis done from the\nside or from behind.\nWhy did I bring up\nthe paper on pets?\nWell it turns out that\nwhen humans stroke dogs,\nor brush their\ndogs or stroke cats\nor brush their cats,\net cetera, that\nis a form of human to\nanimal allogrooming.\nAnd it's one in which\nboth the pet and the human\nreceive huge\nincreases in oxytocin\nand other related neurochemicals\nthat make us feel bonded.\nI bring this up because\nthe Harvard longitudinal\nstudy on happiness,\nand many, many others,\nif not hundreds of other\nstudies on happiness,\npoint to the importance of\nquality social connection.\nYou hear this over\nand over again.\nPeople on their\ndeathbeds don't say\nthey wish they had worked more.\nPeople on their deathbeds\ntalk about the richness\nof social connections\nor the wish\nthat they had invested\nmore in social connections.\nI think a lot of people\nthink of social connections\nonly in terms of travel with\nor conversation with others.\nBut much of what we perceive\nas deep social connections\nalso involves physical contact.\nAnd that's something\nthat's deeply rooted\nin our evolutionary biology.\nAnd it's present both in us\nand in non-human primates.\nAnd it's clear\nthat we can engage\nin these kinds of pro-social,\nnon verbal, non eye contact\ntype behaviors through things\nlike non-sexual tactile\ntouch, a.k.a.\nallogrooming.\nSo we've been talking about a\nnumber of the different things\nthat one can do in order to\nincrease levels of happiness.\nAnd certainly,\nbefore we conclude\ntoday, I'm going to\ntouch back into not just\nsynthetic happiness and the\nvarious things we can do,\nsuch as prosocial\nspending, allogrooming,\nsocial connection, et cetera.\nBut also things\nrelated to happiness\nthat involve focus on vocation\nand work and pursuit of goals.\nBecause as I mentioned\nat the beginning,\nthose are also\ncritical to increasing\nour state of happiness,\nand certainly\nour state of security\nand the feeling\nthat we can provide for\nourselves and perhaps\nfor others, as well.\nSo we will talk about that.\nBut I think it's also\nimportant to talk\nabout this notion of\nchoice and choices,\nand whether or not having\na lot of freedom to choose\nor limited freedom in choosing\nwhat we do and what we get,\nand what we are able\nto pursue in life,\nhow that relates to\nboth natural happiness\nand synthetic happiness.\nDan Gilbert and\nothers have explored\nthis issue of freedom\nof choice and how\nit relates to happiness.\nAnd there I must\nsay, the findings\nare incredibly counterintuitive.\nBut very, very well supported\nby all of their data.\nI'm going to summarize a large\namount of those studies at once\nby saying the following.\nDan's laboratory and\nother laboratories\nhave done experiments\nwhere they give people\na series of options.\nAnd one of the more\nclassic examples, they\ngive people the opportunity\nto rate a number\nof different\npaintings or pictures\nin ascending or descending\norder of preference.\nIn other words,\nthey're deciding which\nones they like most which\nones they like least.\nThen what's interesting\nis the experimenter\nwill vary the\nextent to which they\nhave to stick to that choice.\nSo this could be\nsticking to the choice\nby receiving that\npainting to take home.\nOr in another\nexperiment, it was having\nto make a choice\nbetween giving up\none photograph that they,\nthe research subject took,\nor another photograph\nthat they took.\nOne of the photographs\nwas going to go off\nto a publication, another one\nthey could keep for themselves.\nAnd the conditions\nin that experiment\nwere either that you\nhad to make the decision\nand it was final, that is,\nyou could keep one and rate\nyour decision, or\nyou could keep one\nand then you had the\nopportunity to swap out\nthat picture for the other\none at some later time.\nIn other words, these\nexperiments really\nweren't about rating pictures,\nthey were really about\nwhether or not constraining\nyour choice, meaning\nforcing somebody\nto make a choice\nand stick to that choice, led\nto greater levels or lesser\nlevels of happiness and\nsatisfaction with that choice.\nAnd what they find\nconsistently is\nthat when people have an\nongoing set of choices\nit leads to reduced\nlevels of happiness.\nNow that might come as\nsurprising to many of you,\nbut I want to be clear\nabout what this means.\nThis is not to say that having a\nlot of choices of what you like\nmost leads to lesser happiness.\nAnd that having fewer\nchoices about things\nyou do, or objects you\nacquire, et cetera,\nleads to greater happiness.\nWhat this set of\nexperiments really points to\nis that when we make a\nchoice, if we are forced\nto stick to that\nchoice we tend to be\nfar happier with that\nchoice than if we maintain\nthe option to change our mind.\nThe results of these experiments\nare extremely informative,\nI believe, in terms of\nunderstanding our real life\nhappiness.\nThat is, happiness\noutside the laboratory.\nBut I think they are\noften misunderstood\nas meaning that if we\nhave a lot of choices\nwe tend to be less happy than\nif we have fewer choices.\nThat is not the case.\nHaving freedom of\nchoice is terrific.\nAnd actually, correlates with\nelevated levels of happiness.\nBut once we make\nour choice, it's\nclearly the case that\nkilling all other choices\nor having all other\noptions killed\nfor us increases our\nsatisfaction with the choice\nthat we've made.\nWhereas, leaving doors open,\nleaving options open greatly\ndiminishes our sense\nof satisfaction.\nThis has been exported to any\nnumber of different domains.\nSo this has been exported to\nthe domain of making choices\nabout what college to go to or\nwhat partner to select in life.\nIn every one of\nthose instances, we\nsee that our happiness\nwith our choice\nis very much related\nto that choice\nbeing either the only one or\none of very few other options.\nThere are a number of different\nways to interpret this.\nThrough the lens\nof neuroscience we\nmight say that the\nprefrontal cortex,\nthe area of the brain that's\ninvolved in decision making\nand evaluating\ndifferent options,\nis an area of the brain\nthat's vital, frankly,\nto our evolution as human\nbeings and to our daily life\nand to our whole life.\nIt is, of course,\nthe thing that allows\nus to evaluate different rule\nsets, to change rule sets,\nto switch contexts and to\ncreate meaning, et cetera.\nTo interpret what's\ngood what's bad.\nBut it's also a\nfairly costly process,\nmeaning it's very\nmetabolically demanding.\nAnd there's an entire\nliterature related\nto what's called ego depletion.\nThis is certainly a topic\nfor a future podcast.\nBut ego depletion essentially\nsays that if I have you\nattend very intensely to a\ngiven task, for instance,\nasking you to count\nbackwards from 1,000 to 0\nin increments of 13.\nAnd then have you\nswitch about halfway\nthrough, that's hard\nfor a lot of people.\nIf I have you do that,\nthen your ability\nto suppress impulsive behavior\nand to do a hard cognitive\nor physical task immediately\nafter that is actually\nsuppressed.\nThis so-called ego depletion.\nIt relates to a number\nof different things,\nbut it certainly\nrelates to engagement\nof the prefrontal\ncortex, which is\nvery metabolically demanding.\nSo evaluating choices and\ndoing computation of numbers\nor attending to\nthings with your mind\nand forcing yourself\nto focus intensely\nis metabolically demanding.\nAnd that's a limited\nresource that\ncan be reset by things like\nsleep and non sleep deep rest\nor idle time or letting\nyour mind wander.\nIn that case a\npositive mind wandering\nto allow your brain to\nreset its ability to focus.\nBut the other thing\nthat it does is\nit impacts the reward\ncircuitry of the brain,\nthe so-called dopamine reward\ncircuitry and other reward\ncircuitry of the brain.\nAnd here I'm painting\nwith a broad brush.\nBut it essentially divides\nthem such that for instance,\nif a given choice of\na let's say a partner\nor maybe buying ourselves\nan article of clothing,\nnot that I want to compare\nselection of a life partner\nto selection of an\narticle of clothing.\nBut just to give\nmultiple examples.\nMight give us, and here\nit's arbitrary units, x\nunits of dopamine increase.\nWell, if we buy that\narticle of clothing or we\nselect that life\npartner, and then\nwe emerge from the\nstore or the wedding\nand we are focused on what\nwe purchased for ourselves,\nour choice, or our life partner\nchoice, and only that, well\nthen there's a certain amount of\nneurochemical reward associated\nwith that.\nAnd happiness and well-being.\nBut it's also very\nclear that if we\nleave those choices, the store\nor our wedding for instance,\nor a life with somebody for\na moment, even just mentally,\nand start thinking\nabout the other options\nthat we might\nentertain as possible.\nIf those are still open to\nus in reality or in our mind,\nwell then our reward circuitry\nbecomes fractured in a way.\nNot physically fractured,\nbut less attention\nis devoted to the reward\ncircuitry associated\nwith our choice.\nAnd as a consequence, instead\nof it being x units of dopamine,\nit's x divided by however\nmany other choices\nwe might have available to\nus in our mind or in reality.\nSo instead of, and again,\nthese are arbitrary units,\nbut instead of a certain\namount of reward,\nit's a certain amount\nof reward divided\nby the number of\nother options that we\nmight be considering as\nalternatives to what we chose.\nAnd I think this is a\nvery important aspect\nof understanding how limiting\nour choices after we've\nmade them is a\nvital part of what\nwe call synthetic happiness.\nIn fact, we could\neven go so far as\nto say that focusing on\nthe choices we've made\nand really investing in\nthose choices as good ones,\nor great ones, and\nreally trying to limit\nour thinking to the\nchoices that we've\nmade once we've\nmade them is perhaps\nalso important to our\nnatural happiness.\nBecause it's so inextricably\nentwined with what\nwe think of as a good life.\nAnd what I mean by that\nis if we are constantly\nin a mode of evaluative\ndecision making,\neven after we've\nmade a decision,\nwe are not neurochemically\nnor psychologically able\nto extract the feelings\nof happiness associated\nwith the choice that we made.\nSo we've talked about a\nnumber of different dimensions\nof happiness, both in synthetic\nand natural happiness.\nAnd some of the more\ncounterintuitive aspects\nof happiness.\nFor instance, that\npeople tend to adjust\ntheir levels of happiness not\nregardless but often in spite\nof their life circumstances.\nBut as we emphasized earlier\nin the episode, that is not\nto say, at least the\nresearch does not directly\nsupport the idea that\na major trauma or loss\nwon't impact our happiness.\nIn fact, it tends to.\nAnd that's why it's\nimportant that people access\nresources and work devoted\nto overcoming trauma, which\ncertainly exists out there.\nAnd of course, there are\nthe longitudinal studies\nin short term studies showing\nthat income level and material\nthings don't necessarily scale\nwith happiness, and vise versa.\nAnd yet, we also acknowledged\nearly in the episode\nthat while indeed money\ncan't buy happiness,\nit can buffer stress.\nAnd while work doesn't\nnecessarily bring happiness,\nper se, work can bring\na tremendous feeling\nof meaning and resources\nwhich can then put you\ninto context in which things\nlike prosocial contact\nand enhanced bonds and\ncaretaking of others and of you\ncan be enhanced.\nSo it would be unfair\nand in fact, inaccurate,\nto simply view happiness\nthrough the lens of money\ndoesn't matter, it's all\nabout social connection.\nAnd so on and so forth.\nAbsolutely, social\nconnection is important,\nwhich is why we spent some\nminutes talking about some\nof the ways to enhance\nsocial connection\nboth with other human\nbeings and other animals,\nand them with us.\nI think there's a opportunity\nhere to take the research\non happiness, the research\non the neuroscience of what\nhappiness and gratitude and\nprosocial connection tells us,\nand to combine it into a\nbit of a model or a toolkit,\nif you will.\nAnd I think indeed, this\nwill be a toolkit in one\nof our future toolkit episodes,\nlikely merged with the toolkit\non gratitude, which\nwe haven't done yet.\nAnd perhaps even we will do an\nentire episode on social bonds\nand how to enhance or\nbuild social bonds.\nOr at least what the\nscience tells us about that.\nIf we take a step\nback and we look\nat the concept of happiness,\nwe can make a couple\nof absolute statements.\nThat is, statements that I\nthink very few people, if any,\nwould contest.\nFirst of all, there's no\nsingle molecule or chemical\nassociated with happiness,\nbut that the chemical milieu\nof the brain and body\nis important for setting\nthe stage or the\nopportunity for happiness.\nHence, why there are treatments\naimed at alleviating depression\nor mania that target certain\nneurochemical systems\nand hormone systems.\nHappiness, at least the\nway I'm framing it today,\nhas essentially two components.\nOne is meaning.\nThat is, what sort of meaning\ndo certain types of interactions\nor behaviors, could be work,\ncould be social interactions,\net cetera, carry for us?\nAnd nested in that is this\nconcept of connection.\nAnd we talked a bit about\ntools for enhancing connection.\nThings like eye contact, but\nnot constant eye contact.\nThings like being very\npresent to a conversation\nor an activity that\nyou're engaging in.\nRemember, we talked\nabout the paper,\n\"A Distracted Mind\nis an Unhappy Mind\"?\nThe paper published in Science.\nAnd we talked about the study,\nalso published in Science\nin which giving money, but\nalso knowing how that money has\npositively impacted\nothers, leads\nto this feeling of pro-social\nconnection and happiness\nin the giver and\nin the receiver.\nAnd I should mention\nagain that it's not\njust the giving of money but\nalso the giving of effort\nand time and attention that\ncan have similar effects.\nSo we have meaning\nand connection,\nand a number of different\nways to access those.\nAnd then we have\nthis access that I'm\nreferring to as\nperformance and resources.\nAnd I'm talking about\nperformance and resources\nas it relates to\nnatural happiness, not\nsynthetic happiness,\nbut natural happiness.\nBecause we would be\nwrong, I believe,\nif we were to say that\nincome doesn't matter.\nI think it's fair to say,\nbased on the research,\nthat income matters.\nAnd income that can cover\ncosts of living plus that\nincludes some buffer.\nAnd what do I mean by buffer?\nI mean buffer to the anxiety\nthat circumstances might change\nis important.\nNow that's going to vary\nfrom person to person.\nMeaning some people\nwill be perfectly happy\nmaking $1 more than their\nabsolute cost of living\nevery month.\nOther people will require\na more substantial buffer\nin order to protect them against\nthe negative psychological\neffects of worrying about\nfor instance, inflation.\nOr worrying that they\nmight lose their job.\nAnd this is why I think\nmost people recommend\nhaving, if possible, some\nbuffer in their bank account\nthat could cover two or\nthree or maybe even six\nor maybe even 12 months\nof living expenses\nwere they to lose\ntheir job or something\ncatastrophic happened to them.\nSo if we're going to\ntalk about happiness,\nI think it's only fair, only\naccurate, and frankly, only\nrespectful to talk about\nliving requirements and cost\nof living requirements.\nThat includes this\nsort of buffer.\nAnd that buffer to\nanxiety is going\nto vary depending on how\nanxious somebody gets\nabout the possibility\nof catastrophic things\nhappening to them, like\nlosing their job or their rent\ngoing up or doubling.\nAnd here, I'm talking\nabout hypotheticals.\nBut I think we all know\npeople and perhaps ourselves\nhave experienced those\nkinds of circumstances.\nSo when we talk about\nhappiness we absolutely\nneed to think about resources.\nAnd we also need to\nthink about performance.\nI think we would be completely\ninaccurate if we simply\nsaid, oh, any work\nleading to any outcomes.\nAny effort, regardless\nof whether or not\nit gets you an A in\nschool or an F in school\nisn't going to impact\nyour happiness.\nI don't think anyone\nwould agree with that.\nAnd yet if you look at\nthe major takeaways,\nat least as they are\ncommunicated typically\nin the public sphere around\nthe longitudinal and short term\nstudies of happiness,\nthe takeaway generally\nis more focused on\nsocial connection\nand how money is not important.\nI don't think anyone that's\nsaying that actually means\nthat income that can cover\nyour expenses plus some buffer\nisn't important.\nBut it's often not stated.\nSo if we were to come up with a\ngeneral model of happiness that\nincludes various tools\nfor how to increase\nour levels of happiness,\nI think it's only\nfair to include both natural\nand synthetic forms of happiness\nand to pursue both natural\nand synthetic happiness.\nJust to remind you,\nnatural happiness\nis the kind of happiness\nthat we associate\nwith obtaining something,\neither by effort\nor because it was given to us.\nAlthough, I definitely want\nto highlight the fact that\nreceiving things that don't\nrequire much reward in order\nto receive them over\ntime can be detrimental\nto our dopamine system.\nThat's an important aside.\nThe other form of happiness\nis the form of happiness\nthat we call\nsynthetic happiness.\nWhich is, for instance,\nfocusing on social connection.\nAnd we talked about ways\nto do that as a means\nto enhance your happiness.\nAgain, the language, the\nname synthetic happiness\nimplies something\nkind of artificial.\nBut frankly, genuine social\nconnection is genuine.\nThere's nothing\nartificial about it\nor synthetic about it, is\nthat you can synthesize it\nthrough action, through\ndeliberate action.\nLikewise, being focused\nor encouraging yourself.\nWorking on being focused on\nwhatever activities you happen\nto be engaged in,\npositive or negative,\nis known to increase\nyour levels of happiness.\nAgain, this is a form\nof synthetic happiness.\nYou're not obtaining\nanything new or additional\nas a consequence of this.\nIt's entirely internal.\nThere's no external reward.\nThere isn't more\nmoney that arrives\nwith this or a better grade.\nAlthough, I would\nmake the argument\nthat if you are\npresent to the work\nyou're doing in any context,\nphysical or mental work,\nit's very likely\nthat you are going\nto perform better at that work.\nSo we have natural happiness\nand synthetic happiness.\nAnd both of them require\nour attention and effort.\nAnd in fact, if we\nwere to draw a link\nbetween natural and\nsynthetic happiness,\nit really is this\nconcept of presence,\nof really being focused\non what we're doing,\nthat's most likely to lead\nto the outcomes that we want.\nBoth externally, in terms of\nreceiving monetary rewards\nor grades, or\npraise, or whatever\nit is that you happen to\nbe pursuing out there,\nresources of some kind.\nAnd presence, and\nstriving to be present\nwhen in the pursuit of so-called\nsynthetic happiness in the form\nof social connection or in\nthe form of really focusing\non the choice that\nyou've made and making\nthe best of that choice,\nespecially since you\nmade that choice in a way that\nyou deemed best at the time.\nWell, that also is known to\nincrease your overall levels\nof happiness.\nSo if an ability to focus\nand attend to things deeply\nis really what's most important,\nand really acts as the greatest\nlever for both natural\nand synthetic happiness,\nwell then, tools like a 5 minute\ndaily meditation or a 13 minute\nday meditation, as\nwell as tools that\nallow us to get excellent\nsleep every night.\nWhich, of course, sets the basis\nfor attention during the day.\nIf you've ever had a\npoor night's sleep then\nyou are very familiar\nwith how hard it\nis to focus the following day.\nAt least for long\nperiods of time.\nBut building our\ncapacity to focus\nthrough a focusing exercise,\nwhich again, is often\ncalled meditation, but\nis really simply just\na focusing and\nperceptual exercise.\nThat's going to create\nan outsized effect\non all the aspects,\nall the behaviors\nthat we know feed into\ncreating natural and synthetic\nhappiness.\nAnd so it's really fair\nto say that our ability\nto attend and focus really\nequates to happiness.\nSo as is often typical\nof this podcast,\ntoday we've talked a lot\nabout the various aspects\nof the science of happiness,\nincluding the different forms\nof happiness and tools to\naccess those different forms\nof happiness.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to\nour YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to the
