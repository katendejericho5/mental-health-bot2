    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nRecently the\nHuberman Lab podcast\nhosted a live event at The\nWiltern theater in Los Angeles.\nIt was entitled The\nBrain Body Contract.\nThe first part of the evening\nwas a lecture about science\nand science-based tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nThe second half was a\nquestion and answer period,\nin which the audience asked\nme questions from the podcast,\nor related to their\nown interests or things\nthat they've gleaned from\nsocial media, or just\ngeneral questions about mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd I answered those\nquestions for them.\nWe wanted to make the recorded\nversion of that question\nand answer session\navailable to everybody,\nregardless of who could attend.\nSo what follows is the\nquestion and answer\nperiod from The Wiltern\ntheater Brain Body Contract\nlive Huberman Lab event.\nI want to be sure to thank\nthe sponsors from that event.\nThey were Eight\nSleep, which makes\nsmart mattress covers with\nheating and cooling capacity.\nI started sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover about eight months\nago, and it is completely\ntransformed by Sleep.\nI sleep so much deeper,\nI wake up far less\nduring the middle of\nthe night, if at all.\nAnd I wake up feeling far\nbetter than I ever have even\nafter the same amount of sleep.\nIn fact, I love my Eight Sleep\nso much that when I travel,\nnow I'm quite bothered that\nAirbnbs and hotels don't\nhave Eight Sleep\nmattress covers on them.\nAnd I've even shipped my\nEight Sleep mattress cover out\nto meet me in the location\nthat I arrived to so that I\nget the best possible sleep.\nIf you want to try Eight Sleep,\ngo to eightsleep.com/huberman\nto save up to $400 off their\nSleep Fit holiday bundle,\nwhich includes their\nnew Pod 3 Cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, United Kingdom,\nselect countries in the EU,\nand Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nI'd like to also thank our\nsupplement partner, Momentous.\nThey make the very highest\nquality supplements.\nThey ship internationally, and\nthey've formulated supplements\nas single ingredient\nformulations that\nmatch what is discussed on\nthe Huberman Lab podcast.\nIf you're interested in\nany of those supplements,\nplease go to\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now without further ado,\nthe question and answer period\nfrom the Huberman Lab\nlive event in Los Angeles.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nWhat occurs in the mind\nbody when you have ADHD?\nAre there ways to address\nit without medication?\nThank you for this question.\nSo attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder\nused to be called ADD.\nThe hyperactivity part\nis a little misleading.\nAnd again I'm not\na clinician here.\nHere's what we know\nworks for some people,\nand yet there are\nalways going to be\nside effects of any kind of\nchemical manipulation, which\nis that, we know that people,\nkids, and adults with ADHD\nactually have a tremendous\ncapacity to focus if they like\nwhat they're focusing on.\nYou take a kid with\nADHD who can't focus\nand you give them their\nfavorite video game\nand they are a laser.\nThe threshold to access the\ndopamine system is higher.\nAnd dopamine has this\nincredible ability\nto focus the brain and other\naspects of the nervous system.\nCertainly, if people\nrequire medication,\nI'm not going to tell you to\nstop taking that medication.\nBut the focus training exercises\nthat have been explored mainly\nin China, but they're starting\nto be explored over here\nas well, do seem\nto be of benefit.\nAnd these are as they sound.\nThey use them in schools in\nChina now, which are literally\nvisual focus exercises.\nYour mental focus,\nthat is your ability\nto focus on things cognitively,\nfollows your visual focus.\nAnd of course your\nstress will anchor your--\nessentially put you in a\nsoda straw view of the world.\nSo yes, there are non\nmedication-based treatments.\nBy medication I'm assuming you\nmean prescription medication.\nThere are of course\nsupplement-based medications\nthat will increase\ndopamine mainly L-tyrosine.\nAgain, this is\nsomething to think\ncarefully about before\nyou start tampering\nwith your dopamine system.\nBut it is the--\nL-tyrosine is the\nprecursor to dopamine.\nSo it will raise\nyour dopamine levels.\nBut I believe, and\nyou'll hear me say this\nas many times as necessary,\nthat one should--\nif you can rely on\nbehavioral tools first,\nthen of course, sleep and\nnutritionists are prerequisite.\nAgain, for all mental health,\nphysical health performance,\nyou simply can't neglect those.\nAnd then and only\nthen if all of that\nisn't working to rely on\nsupplement-based tools\nor on prescription medication.\nSo it's clear that Vyvanse,\nAdderall, Ritalin, et cetera\nwork for ADHD, but\nsome people choose\nto rely on more subtle forms\nof pharmacologic manipulation\nlike L-tyrosine.\nAnd this focusing\nexercise essentially\nconsists of spending\n1 to 3 minutes trying\nto maintain visual focus.\nAnd yes, you are\nallowed to blink.\nI don't know why we tend\nto stare at something\nwe don't blink.\nBut don't let your eyes dry out.\nAnd that can increase your\nability to focus cognitively.\nAnd it works.\nAnd keep in mind that focusing\nalways involves a refocusing.\nWe covered a beautiful data\nset, not collected by my lab\nbut by Wendy Suzuki's Lab at\nNYU, that at roughly 10-minute,\nit's actually 13-minute a\nday meditation of the sort,\nwhere you just focus\non your breathing,\nhas been shown to improve\nfocus significantly.\nWhy don't we hear\nabout this more?\nWell she's now Dean of\nArts and Sciences at NYU\nand all the students\nare hearing about it.\nHopefully, they're doing it.\nBut it takes a little\nbit of discipline\nfor some reason 10-minute\na day type meditation\nis something that very few\npeople follow consistently.\nBut if you're looking for non\nmedication-based treatments\nfor ADHD, or you're somebody\nwho just struggles with focus,\nthe focusing exercise\nor the meditation,\nI just subscribed it can be\nvery useful, so say the data.\nYeah, thanks for bringing\nup space-time bridging.\nAre people familiar with\nwhat space-time bridging is?\nI haven't talked a lot about it.\nOK, this is-- thanks\nfor bringing that up.\nWe actually have an episode\non meditation coming\nup soon where I cover it.\nAnd I talked about\nit long ago and then\nI kind of abandoned it because\nwell, we wanted more data\nand it's a pretty\ninteresting technique.\nIf you think about the\nnervous system and vision\nin particular, but if you're not\na sighted person or you're low\nvision, or no vision, you could\ndo this with your hearing.\nBut I'm going to assume most\npeople here are sighted.\nIf not just translate this\nto the auditory system.\nYou have this incredible\nability to close your eyes\nand focus, for instance, on--\npeople talk about the third eye\ncenter, focusing right\nbehind your forehead.\nDo you know why people do\nthat when they meditate?\nThe reason is that\nyou actually have\nno sensation in your brain.\nIt's the one place to focus\nyour attention for which\nyou abandon sensation.\nIf I think about any portion\nof my body or my breathing,\neither I'm going to\nsense what's happening.\nI'm going to perceive\nmy inner landscape,\nso-called interior\nreception, or my outer.\nIf I look out into the world,\nit's external perception.\nWhen you focus your attention\nwith your eyes closed,\nyou do have to close your eyes\njust behind your forehead.\nYou are focusing on your\nthinking Sort of obvious,\nbut I don't-- at least to me it\nnever been stated that clearly.\nAgain, one of the\nproblems with some\nof the more traditional\npractices but also the problem\nwith science, is that there's a\nshrouding of everything in very\ncomplex language, which sucks.\nWhy is it suck?\nBecause it's a separator.\nYou eliminate the\nnumber of people\nthat can be brought to\npotentially useful practices.\nAnd I don't like it when\npeople, including myself,\noveruse mechanism and\ndescriptions of fancy phrases\nto mask basic principles,\nso simplest language\nI think it tends to unify\npeople around the practices.\nSo when you focus on this\nso-called third eye center,\nor a spot right behind your\nforehead or on your breath--\nit's a little tricky\nwith the breath,\nbut when you focus on\nyour frontal cortex,\nthere's nothing to sense.\nBecause there's no\nsensory neurons there.\nThere's no touch.\nThere's no pain.\nNothing.\nThat's why in these gory movies,\nyou can take the skull off\nand-- while in neurosurgeries\nthey're poking around in there,\nand the person's\nplaying a violin.\nLike no anesthetic\nNo anesthetic.\nDoesn't require anesthetic.\nThere's no sensory neurons.\nYou can't sense anything there.\nSo space-time\nbridging involves--\nit's essentially a\nmeditation, but it's really\na perceptual exercise.\nI think that's where\nwe're going with this,\nis it starts by\nclosing your eyes\nand focusing on that\nlocation for which there\nis no sensation.\nThere's only thought.\nAnd then opening your eyes\nand focusing on a location\nmaybe about the\ndistance of your hand.\nAnd you focus also\non your breathing.\nSo you sort of imagine a kind\nof a tether between that.\nYou can split your attention\nto these two locations.\nYou're thinking about\nyour body and you're\nthinking about a\nlocation outside of you.\nAnd then while\ncontinuing to think\nabout your body,\nso-called intersection,\nfocus on your breathing,\nyou focus further out,\nand then further out,\nand then further out.\nAnd then ultimately, you know\nthat little cartoon or meme\nwhere they're like, we're just\na little blue dot floating\nin a big universe.\nAnd like it's supposed to make\nall your problems go away.\nIt kind of works\nbecause what you've done\nis you've expanded\nyour perception,\nand you go oh, yeah the stuff\nthat's happening in here\nis really important\nwhen I'm focused\non what's happening in here.\nBut when I'm focused\non what's going on\nand the vastness of all\nthis, and we're just\na little pale blue\ndot and all that,\nit changes your perception.\nNot just your visual\nperception obviously.\nChanging your visual\nperception changes\nyour cognitive\nperception, which changes\nyour emotional experience.\nSo the space-time bridging\nis a perceptual exercise\nwhere you step from\nfocusing internally\nto focusing externally\nat a short distance, then\na further distance, further\ndistance, further distance,\nand then trying to\nimagine yourself\nin this larger landscape.\nIt sounds very mystical but it's\nactually very neurobiological.\nAnd it captures\nsomething really amazing.\nWhy is the T in\nthere-- the time?\nSpace-time bridging,\nbecause this is space?\nBut time is in there because\nwhen you focus in close,\nyour slicing of time is finer.\nYou notice the\nsubtle fluctuations\nin your breathing and things\nthat are happening up close.\nWhereas when you focus further\nout, your perception of time\nactually changes, which\nis why in panoramic vision\nwe are calm.\nAnd when you think\nabout, we're just\na pale blue dot and we\nmostly only live to about 85\nor maybe 100 years old, and\nthen what's happening right now,\nmy boss being a jerk, and\nall that doesn't really\nmatter because the\nEarth is spinning\nand all that kind of stuff.\nWhich is all true.\nAnd it's the stuff of\nphilosophy and mindfulness.\nAnd I think it's beautiful.\nWhat you're really\ndoing is you're\nchanging your time perception by\nchanging your space perception.\nSo space-time bridging\nis very useful\nbecause most people get\nlocked at one step, one\nof these stations, especially\nunder conditions of stress.\nAnd people who have\ntrouble focusing-- and I'm\nglad you brought this up\nin this context of ADHD,\npeople have a hard time\nfocusing whether or not\nthey have ADHD or not,\ntend to skip back and forth\nbetween different\nspace-time domains,\nas we call them in science.\nSo this is a simple\nexercise that you can do.\nFocusing internally then\nstepping out externally,\nand then stepping back in.\nAll the while paying attention\nto your inner landscape\njust simply by focusing\non your breathing.\nIt's a tool that we're\nstill collecting data\non in terms of its utility, but\npeople are already using it.\nAnd I don't think of\nit as a meditation.\nI think of it as a\nperceptual exercise.\nThanks for asking that.\nAs a teenager what\nare five things\nyou would recommend to\nphysically feel my best?\nI'm a 15-year-old surfer\nwho attends high school\nand plays soccer.\nIt sounds like you're doing\na lot of things, right?\nTo physically feel your best.\nSo I'm going to grasp at some\ncontext here that I'm not--\nthat's not within reach.\nI'm assuming if you are\ndoing all these things you're\nhopefully doing a bunch\nof other things too.\nAnd they're going\nto be demands on you\nthat you probably some of\nthem you don't want to do,\nschool and things\nlike that, are going\nto have varying levels of\njoy and delight and demand\nof things you don't want to do.\nI don't want to default always\nto the simplest of tools.\nBut I certainly think\nthat even as a 15-year-old\nif you're not already getting\nlots and lots of sleep,\nthat's going to be great.\nTell your parents\nthat I said you should\nget lots and lots of sleep.\nprovided you're not\nsleeping through classes,\nI'm a professor after all.\nI couldn't tell you otherwise.\nI would say if I could travel\nback in time as a 15-year-old,\nI would encourage you\nto cultivate some sort\nof mindfulness practice.\nI know this sounds\na little cliche,\nbut having some awareness\nof your thinking\nabout your thinking is good.\nBut I'm actually\nnot going to say\nsit down and meditate for 10\nminutes a day, or do NSDR.\nI'm actually not\ngoing to tell you\nthat I think given how\nplastic your brain is,\nhow much it's changing at\n15, I would encourage you--\nand maybe you would set a timer\nfor this, to actually develop\njust a really keen awareness\nof what stresses you out,\nwhat relaxes you, what\ndelights, you et cetera.\nAnd just to simply develop\nan awareness of that,\nbecause those are your antennae.\nAnd I certainly had a\nmeditation practice as a youth,\nmostly given to me, because\nI was a little haywire\nand I needed it.\nAnd it worked pretty well.\nBut I think in\nretrospect, what I\nwish I had developed was more\nof a sense of how I navigated\nstress or things\nand things I enjoyed\nand things I didn't enjoy.\nAnd I would just encourage you\nto have a general awareness.\nTry and detect and\nlearn about what\nraises your adrenaline, what\nraises your dopamine, what\nraises your serotonin, and then\nstart thinking about tools.\nBut, again the\nawareness is going\nto be very valuable and gosh,\nas a 15-year-old you are\nin this amazing blessed period\nof heightened neuroplasticity,\nshould we all be so lucky.\nSo enjoy it.\nNext question please.\nClarity on adrenaline\nregarding cold water.\nShould we wait to feel\nthe rise of adrenaline,\nthe \"get me out of here\"\nfeeling and the fall of it\nbefore bailing?\nYes, provided it\ndoesn't kill you.\nI don't want to say cold water.\nIt's hard to kill yourself with\ncold water, provide your head's\nabove and you're breathing.\nBut it's-- sorry, my podcast\nproducer's always like,\n\"I can't help that.\"\nAnyway, it's a great tool.\nAnd different days\nit'll feel different.\nSo for instance, doing any kind\nof adrenaline and deliberate\ncold exposure, or adrenaline\nincreasing activity early\nin the day, you might find\nthat you are more \"resilient\"\nthan later.\nIn other words, the wall like,\nI really don't want to do this.\nThis is actually\ninteresting for I think\nit extends beyond cold water.\nLet's say you really don't\nwant to do something.\nPay attention to the\nfact that maybe it's\nnot the right thing to do.\nBut assuming it's\nsomething that you\nknow you should do but\nyou don't want to do,\nyou are already in the\nfirst wall of adrenaline.\nYou don't experience\nit necessarily\nas heightened levels of stress.\nYou might experience it as\nheightened levels of fatigue\nor a hard time shifting on\nthat kind of activation state\nthat's required to\nmove through the thing.\nBut I do encourage you to\ntake advantage of that.\nAnd we have an episode coming\nout tomorrow actually that\nanswers questions like, should\nyou train if you're sick\nand what if you travelling.\nAnd there's context always.\nBut I think that you\ndo want to experience.\nIf you want to get the most\nout of the cold water exposure\nand to be more specific the\nadrenaline, then you want\nto get to that point of I\nreally want to get out of here,\nbut I know I can stay in safely.\nBut I really want\nto get out of here.\nAnd it's a little\nhard to explain,\nbut there's just so much\nlearning in those short moments\nabout where your mind goes.\nAnd this sounds very kind of\nagain, subjective and maybe\na little wishy-washy.\nBut you can realize great\nthings about yourself\nin those moments.\nYou can find insight\nin those moments.\nAlso keep in mind that\nthe degree of discomfort,\nnot just physical but\nmental discomfort,\nis directly predictive of\nthe pain to pleasure wave\nthat you'll\nexperience afterwards.\nThe reason it feels so good\nwhen you get out of the ice bath\nand you're showered off--\nI always do the\nwarm shower after.\nI don't do this\nend on cold thing.\nI don't know, It just\nseems a little too painful.\nAnd then take a warm shower\nand then you feel great.\nAnd that's the surge\nof dopamine that we\nknow based on a paper\npublished in the European\nJournal of physiology lasts many\nhours, and it's a 100% to 200%\nincrease in dopamine.\nIt's not a subtle effect.\nAnd then people say,\nwait, is that dopamine\ngoing to crash my\ndopamine system?\nNo, because it's\na nice slow rise.\nIn fact, I am actually not aware\nof many things besides love\nand delight that can\ncreate this long, slow arc\nof dopamine lasting many hours.\nMaybe you're aware\nof other things.\nIf you are, let me know.\nBut it turns out that long\narc is a true anti depressant.\nAnd my colleague at Stanford,\nDr. Anna Lembke who's\nthe head of our Dual\nDiagnosis Addiction Clinic\nhas talked about in her\namazing book Dopamine Nation\nabout patients of hers that\nhave really helped themselves\nalong and out of the more\ndepressive phases of working\nthrough addiction and in\njust depression in general\nthrough directed\ncold water therapy.\nSo I'm obviously a fanatic\nabout it in the sense\nthat it's a powerful relatively\nsafe, if done properly.\nSafe, if done properly,\nway to modulate\nyour internal dopamine.\nHopefully, I answered\nyour question.\nNext question please.\nSorry, I caught it raised it\nwent off the fall, as well.\nYes, I think you should\nget out once you've\naccomplished something.\nDon't get out when you panic\nunless it's dangerous, sorry.\nHow can you train your brain\nto feel more confident moments\nwhere you tend to\nfeel intimidated?\nOK, these are hard question.\nBecause context is tricky\nhere, because I don't know what\nthe context is.\nAnd confidence on short\ntime scales, and then\nlong time scales, so\nconfidence in school,\nconfidence in career,\nthose are long arc things.\nWhereas confidence to be able to\ndo something in the short term\nis different.\nBut remember those\naction sequences\nthat trigger the\nrelease of dopamine.\nI've mainly talked about\nthe dark side of dopamine,\nbut I hopefully also talked\nabout the sort of upward spiral\nthat dopamine can cause,\nmainly by thinking\nabout delight and things\nthat you really enjoy.\nThat carries over.\nAnd I would say that\nyou want to micro slice\nthe demands of what's maybe got\nyou back on your heels a bit.\nActually a good friend of\nmine who's here tonight,\nI think also my\nfriend Pat, he has\na great way of\nconceptualizing this, which\nis for most all\nendeavors we either\nfeel back on our heels,\nflat footed, or forward\ncenter of mass.\nLike we can really do\nsomething, we're flat footed,\nwe're back on our heels.\nAnd sometimes getting\nfrom back on our heels,\nlets call that lack of\nconfidence to just on two feet,\nand confident enough to move\nforward or at least stay\nin the game.\nThat's going to require you\ncould lean on different tools.\nI can't say which would be\nideal for the circumstance you\nhave in mind.\nBut I do think that having\na way to calm yourself\nwill give you access to\nmore internal resources.\nWe know this.\nThis was something\nI meant to bring up\nduring the discussion\nabout fear versus love,\net cetera, trying to\naccess delight and love.\nWhen we are in a state of\nfear or stress or anxiety,\nthe rule set, the options\navailable to us, and indeed\nour creativity, is\ngreatly diminished.\nAnd this has to do with the\nway that the prefrontal cortex\ninteracts with an\narea of the brain\ncalled the insula, which relates\nto our internal landscape.\nAnd there's this\nweird phenomenon,\nwhich is that\nnormally, our brain--\nour thinking brain and our\nrule setting brain can--\nit leads the brain parts that\ncontrol and pay attention\nto how we feel internally.\nAnd that's why for instance,\nif you feel a little nervous\nyou can still do something.\nAt some point you\nget stressed enough.\nAnd we know this from work by\nmy colleague David Spiegel,\nit reverses.\nAnd these areas\nof the brain that\nare paying attention like\nhow flushed my face is,\nor whether or not I'm\nsweating, or my breathing,\nactually start to shut down\ncreative decision making.\nSo I would say the way\nto have more confidence\nis to learn to\ncontrol that stress\nand keep the part of your brain.\nThe prefrontal\ncortex is that part\nthat can come up with\nnew rules that can\nbe funny that can be creative.\nThat keeps that\nbrain part leading.\nThe way to think about this\nis, the prefrontal cortex\nis sort of like the coach,\nand the rest of your brain\nare sort of like the players.\nAnd if you get too stressed, the\nplayers start to lead the game\nand the coach follows, and\nkind of drags them along.\nSo I would encourage you to\nfocus on real-time stress\nmodulation, and to\nraise your stress\nthreshold using the sorts\nof tools we talked about.\nAnd to register your wins.\nI didn't get into this\nin too much detail,\nbut one of the amazing things\nabout the dopamine system\nis that it's highly subject\nto your interpretation.\nIf you tell yourself\nthat a fail was a win,\nand you can see or conceptualize\nsome way in which that's\nactually true, you get to\ntap into the dopamine system.\nYou might think that's crazy.\nYou can cheat your own brain.\nYou can cheat your\nown neurochemistry.\nAnd indeed you can.\nYou can change the time,\nspace-time reference.\nAnd we see this with examples\nlike Nelson Mandela or Viktor\nFrankl.\nYou read their stories trapped\nin little cells, confined,\nimprisoned.\nAnd they come up with new ways\nto access the dopamine system\nby now not thinking about\nwhat they're not getting,\nbut thinking about\nwhat they can control\nin their immediate experience.\nMany examples of this throughout\nliterature and history.\nAnd the dopamine system\nis the life force system.\nI don't say that\nin any loose way.\nDopamine is life force.\nIt's the wish and the\ndesire to continue.\nIt's persistence.\nAnd so if you can think about\nwhat might seem like a failure\nand really spend\nsome time thinking\nabout not the potential\nwins on the outside,\nbut how you can conceptualize\nthat as a potential win\ninternally, you really\ndo get to achieve\nan internal chemical win.\nAnd that chemical win sets\nyou up for more real wins,\nhopeful that make sense.\nIt's incredible how\ncontextualize the dopamine\nsystem is.\nBut if it weren't,\nwhy would it matter\nif we're talking about money or\nmates or food or job or school?\nYou don't get 50 reward\nsystems and motivation systems.\nYou get one, and that's\nthe dopamine system.\nNext question please.\nWhat is the competing mechanism\nbehind bilateral eye movement,\nEMDR, that helps resolve\npsychological trauma?\nThe competing mechanism.\nWell, let me try and\nanswer as best I can.\nI'm not sure I understand the\nfull extent of the question.\nBut let me--\nEMDR, moving your eyes\nfrom side to side, right?\nAnd then recounting a\ntrauma is a very common\nand actually one of the four\napproved treatments that\nare behavioral for trauma.\nSo it's taken seriously in the\npsychiatric and psychological\ncommunity for good reason.\nIt tends to work best for\nsingle event traumas as opposed\nto entire childhoods.\nNo joke there.\nSome people have their entire\nchildhood that was traumatic.\nOther people they experience\na single event trauma\nor repeated periods of the\nsame or similar type of trauma.\nEye movements from\nside to side have\nbeen shown in a\nnumber of studies\nto very potently reduce\nthe activity of a brain\nstructure called the amygdala,\nwhich most people are familiar\nwith, because of the character\nfrom the Star Wars movie,\nAmygdala.\nThere's a neuroscientist\nsomewhere on that team.\nIt is indeed a threat\ndetection center\nand when you move through\nspace, not outer space,\nbut when you walk like\nthis your eyes actually\ngenerate these subtle\nside to side shifts,\nunless you're focusing\non a specific target.\nAnd my lab and\nother laboratories\nhave found that leads to a very\npotent quieting of the threat\ndetection system.\nAnd then EMDR is\nessentially a process\nof pairing that calmer state\nwith no threat detection\nsystem activated with the\nrecount of something that\nnormally would be\nquite triggering.\nSo you've heard of\nPavlovian conditioning,\nlike a bell rings and the\nanimal gets fed and animal\nsalivate eventually, just the\nbell will evoke the salivation.\nYou're doing the\nreverse of that.\nIt's called behavioral\ndesensitization.\nIt has an underlying\nmechanism, et cetera.\nBut the idea is to\npair a calm state\nwith recount of something.\nIt has been shown\nto be successful.\nThere are people who think that\nthe side to side eye movements\nand the recount of\ntrauma may actually be\ninvoking some form of hypnosis.\nMy colleague David Spiegel's\nan expert in clinical hypnosis,\nhas appeared on my\npodcasts, Rituals podcasts\nand a few other podcasts.\nAnd talks about, this it\nis not stage hypnosis,\nit's clinical hypnosis.\nSo there may be\nsomething going on there.\nEMDR-- again, some people\nget great relief from it.\nOther people don't.\nWhat's kind of nice is\nthat this eye movements\nfrom side to side or simply\ntaking a walk as long as you're\nnot looking at your phone and\nnot allowing your eyes to move\nfrom side to side,\nis a very good way\nto shut down the fear\nand stress system.\nSo taking a walk I think is\nrelaxing for obvious reasons.\nAnd there are data\nshowing that part\nof the reason why animals\nscratch at the door\nand want to go for a walk may\nnot actually be the exercise.\nThere's kind of an anxiety\nand then an anxiety relief\nthat occurs.\nOf course, they have to\ngo to the bathroom too.\nOne of Costello's\ngreat joys in life\nwas just peeing on everything\noutdoors, thankfully.\nSo the psychological trauma\nrewiring, unfortunately there\nhaven't been a lot of brain\nimaging studies looking\nat this long term of\nhow well EMDR works.\nWhat I think is going to\nhappen in the next few years\nby the way, is it is not going\nto be a discussion around,\nshould you do\nEMDR, should you do\ntranscranial\nmagnetic stimulation,\nshould you do\nbehavioral therapy?\nIt's going to be\ncombination therapies.\nCombination therapies, including\npharmacologic manipulations\nto essentially give a\nboost to the systems that\nencourage neuroplasticity,\nlike dopamine and serotonin and\nadrenaline.\nAnd then also then perform EMDR.\nAnd if you want to\ntalk about what's\nhappening in the landscape\nof clinical trials\non some of the psychedelics,\nI'm happy to talk about it.\nThey're still\nillegal, but they are\nbeing used in clinical trials.\nAnd very interesting\nstuff is happening there.\nOK, next question please.\nWhat new research\nor interventions\nare you most excited\nabout in the realm\nof health and wellness?\nSo what I think is\ngoing to be very\ninteresting in the\nnext few years really\nreflects my memory\nobsession that you've\nseen a little bit of tonight.\nBut the thing that I think\nis going to be most useful--\nand I've seen this\nin science before\nand I think we're going to\nsee it in health and wellness.\nIt's that there are all these\ntools and all these people,\nand he's saying this\nand she's saying that.\nBut what, we're going to\nstart paying attention to\nis, what are the common themes?\nAnd a broader and\nmore important theme\nis going to be one of\nmodulation versus mediation.\nWhat do I mean?\nWell, if someone were to\npull a fire alarm right now,\nand please don't, that\nwill shift our attention\nand make it hard to\nfocus on what I'm saying.\nAnd knowing me I'd probably\njust stay up here talking.\nDo we think that fire\nalarms mediate attention?\nNo, they modulate it.\nIf it were very\ncold in this room\nlike it was when we first got\nhere tonight, or arctic cold--\nhopefully it's warmed up a bit.\nIt has and I'm so sorry.\nSo sorry.\nYeah, I attempted to-- yeah.\nI almost thought\nmaybe we all just do\na bunch of breathing to heat\nup like adrenaline release.\nBut these days getting\ngroups of people\nto all breathe on each\nother is not exactly a--\nI can see that might go\nthe wrong way in terms\nof what people interpret.\nSo the idea here is that\ncertain things directly\nmediate something.\nLike a physiological\nside directly\ncalms you down quickly.\nIt mediates the\ncalming response.\nGetting good sleep makes\nyou less easily triggered.\nIt modulates stress.\nBut is sleeping directly\nmediating stress control?\nNo, and I think this\nis really important.\nAnd this brings up the\ntopic of the gut-brain axis.\nThe gut is rich with\nthese little bugs,\nbacteria trillions\nof them, which\nis an eerie thought to me.\nBut also the surface of your\nskin, the surface of your eyes,\nyou have a skin microbiome,\na nasal microbiome.\nEvery mucosal lining\nhas a microbiome.\nIn fact, think about this.\nThis is a crazy but\nworthwhile tangent.\nHave you ever bitten the\ninside of your mouth?\nIt sucks, right?\nAnd you get cut and it hurts.\nBut guess what, the\ninside of your mouth\nheals without a scar.\nThink about that.\nWeird, right?\nYou cut anywhere\nelse on your body,\nand depending on\nhow well you heal,\nand your age and your immune\nstatus, you get a scar.\nYour mouth is\nfilled with bacteria\nand it's open to the world,\nbut the gut microbiome,\nprovided it's healthy,\nprovides an incredible ability\nto heal quickly.\nAnd I'm not somebody who's\ndone a lot of acupuncture.\nI went a few times.\nAnd now there's\ninteresting science\nhappening on acupuncture.\nBut what's the first thing\nthey do when you walk in there?\nLet me see your tongue.\nAnd then they go oh, yeah.\nAnd they have this\ncool intuition\nthat's not based on Western\nmechanistic science.\nIt's more of an intuition\nbased on millions,\nif not billions of\ndata points that have\nbeen put into these charts.\nIt's pretty cool.\nAnd what they are\nlooking at, I believe\nand from what my colleagues who\nwork on microbiome tell me is,\nthey can look at the\npallor of your tongue,\nin particular in the\nback and get a sense of\nwhether or not the\nmicrobiome there\nis of the appropriate stuff.\nBut they don't go,\noh, lactobacillus.\nRemember this all end\nto illness, right?\nBut then, Oh you're just biotic.\nInstead they get a sense.\nNow, parents of\nsmall babies learn\nto detect all sorts\nof things coming out\nof essentially every\norifice of the child\nas a readout of health\nbecause the child doesn't\nhave language.\nAnd a dog owners unfortunately\nyou want to do this too,\nfor better or for worse.\nProbably for better, right?\nSo we have this intuition\nabout gut health.\nBut gut health would be\nanother example, where\nit's very clear now that\nfiber can be helpful\nbut it's mostly consuming\nthese fermented foods\nthat have been used for ages.\nBut low sugar fermented foods of\nthe natto, kimchi, sauerkraut,\nkombucha, et cetera,\nall these things\ndepending on which\nculture you're in,\nthey come in different forms.\nCertain yogurts, et cetera, that\nallow the gut to be healthy.\nAnd it modulates a\nhuge number of systems.\nSo I don't think\nthat you're going\nto cure depression by\nadjusting your gut microbiome.\nBut if your gut microbiota are\nnot well, and you improve that,\nit will indeed shift the\nneurotransmitter systems\nof your brain and give\nyou a elevated mood.\nThat shouldn't come\nas a surprise anymore.\nBut I think that the whole\nworld thinks like, gosh it must\nbe the serotonin in the gut.\nNo, it's actually\nnot serotonin gut.\nIt's that the gut microbiota\ncreate chemicals that actually\nbecome serotonin in the\nbrain, or become dopamine\nin the brain.\nAnd so I think that\nthe gut microbiome,\nI would put in\nthe same category,\nalthough not quite as important.\nI would put it in the\ncategory of like sleep.\nIt modulates a huge\nnumber of other processes.\nIt doesn't mediate them.\n, So sunlight, sleep,\nhealthy gut microbiome,\nexercise, good nutrition,\nsocial connection, these things\nall create this general milieu\nor environment of health.\nI would like to see more\ndistinction between modulating\nand mediating effects\nand tools out there,\nbecause I also see a lot\nof unnecessary argument.\nPeople are like,\nthere's no example\nthat improving your gut\nmicrobiome cures depression.\nOf course there's not.\nBut there are really\ngood examples.\nIf your gut microbiome\nis off that improving\nit can improve mood,\nwhich depending\non where you are on that\nspectrum of depression\ncan really relieve things.\nSo I think that the\nfuture of health,\nwe hear so much about\npersonalized medicine\nand matched to your genome.\nBut we don't even\nhave the basic.\nMost people don't even\nhave the basics right.\nAnd if you watch or listen\nto the podcast long enough,\nhopefully certain themes\nstart to repeat themselves.\nBut a key theme that\nyou learn in science,\nyou teach your students, does it\nmodulate or does it mediate it?\nYou need to be careful\nwith your language there.\nAnd there's great information,\nor as we say, interpretation\npower there.\nIf you understand\nthe difference then\nI think we can go a long way\nby making that distinction\nmodulating versus mediating.\nThere are probably other\nthings that modulate health\nthat I'm overlooking\nnow just because\nof the flow that I'm in.\nThe CoolMitt.\nYeah, the CoolMitt.\nPalmer cooling.\nOK, I promised to talk\nabout Palmer cooling.\nWell, I'll do it now.\nPalmer cooling they\nchanged the Q&A format.\nWhat can I say, this is like\nteaching in the classroom.\nAll right, very briefly.\nThe Palmer cooling, which\nis essentially placing--\nyou can cool the core\nof the body most quickly\nby placing cold objects on the\nhands, the bottoms of the feet,\nor on the top of\nthe face, because\nof the arrangement\nof vasculature.\nNormally, you've got this\narteries, capillaries,\nveins things, but at those\nlocations in the body,\nyou skip the capillaries\nand you can basically--\nyou're not really\npassing cooling the body,\nbut you're cooling off the\ncore of the body more quickly.\nAnd, if you do that in\nbetween sets of exercise\nor during a run or cycling\nyou can dramatically\nincrease your\nability to continue.\nI actually use the CoolMitt\nfor cognitive work.\nBut you don't need a CoolMitt.\nSorry, guys.\nYou can just get a thing of ice\nwater or just very cold water.\nAnd I know it sounds\ntrivially easy,\nbut you're actually\njust cooling your core\nby putting your hands or\neven one hand on a relatively\ncold thing of water or ice.\nBut not so cold that it\nconstricts the vasculature\nthere.\nThis is the incredible work of\nmy colleague at Stanford Dr.\nCraig Heller.\nWhy wouldn't more people\ndo this if you can\ndouble the amount of endurance?\nBelieve it or not.\nOr double the number\nof sets of exercise\nyou can do or feel more alert\nand do more cognitive work.\nWhy wouldn't more people do it?\nBecause people just don't do it.\nAnd it sounds crazy.\nIt really sounds crazy,\nbut it's a real thing.\nAnd I wish more\npeople would do it.\nThe athletes at Stanford do it.\nPeople in the military do it.\nSo people who know and\nthey use it, enjoy it.\nIt's just it's almost like\nseems to off target from what\nyou're trying to accomplish.\nI don't know, for\nsome reason, people\nare finally onboard breathing\nlike in a specific way\nas a useful tool.\nA few years ago no\none was into that.\nI mean, just think of\nhow far we've come.\nIt's incredible.\nPeople are talking about\npsychedelics, meditation,\nbreathing.\nI think the pandemic\nfor all its pains\nand, you know,\nwhat a challenging\nperiod for all sorts of reasons,\ndid wake people up to the idea\nthat you have to take\ncontrol over your health,\nbecause there's no magic\nfairy coming to do it for you.\nAnd with all due respect there's\nno government agency that's\ngoing to drop off the kit\nat your front door of like,\nhere's how you take\ngood care of yourself.\nSo it just not going to happen.\nAnd it wouldn't happen\nunder any circumstances.\nSo it's a personal\nresponsibility issue.\nAll right.\nWhat lessons from skateboarding?\nThe failure part.\nThe failure,\nfailure, or failure.\nI mean, for me skateboarding--\nnever was a good skateboarder.\nI still have close\nfriends in that community\nand our photographer\nand a guy who\ndoes all the visuals\nand the other guys\ndo the visuals for our podcast,\nMike Blabac, Chris, and Martin,\nall of that community.\nI think that for me that\ncommunity was really--\nas Mike will sometimes say,\nskateboarders hate everything,\nmeaning they have a very\nhigh threshold for what\nthey consider acceptable.\nIt's not just what you do.\nIt's how you do it.\nSuper important.\nAnd I think in\nneuroscience, there\nare a lot of-- there's\na lot of stuff.\nIn science in general,\nthere are so many papers\nand there are so\nmany experiments.\nHow do you navigate\nthat landscape?\nI think it helped me\ndevelop a sense of taste.\nBut the taste that\nI'm referring to\nis not necessarily\na taste of which\nscience is cool or not cool.\nThat too, but it came\nthrough a few times\ntonight when I was\ntalking about my mentors.\nI picked back then\nskateboarding because I really\nliked the people.\nAnd also you didn't need\nyour parents to go to a game.\nAnd so that worked for me.\nAnd you could kind of\nmake your own schedule.\nAnd I do think it's very\nimportant to the extent\nthat you can, in science\nand in everything,\nto surround yourself\nwith the kinds of people\nthat you just really\nenjoy being around.\nAnd so to me, the\npodcast, running a lab,\nfeels a lot like skateboarding.\nIt's the same energy.\nIt's the same neurochemical\nsystems firing, so that's--\nyeah, that one.\nNext?\nFavorite Feynman.\nOh, I know that's inappropriate.\nI do have a Feynman story,\nbut it's inappropriate.\nDarn it.\nDamn.\nMaybe some time.\nThis is why I don't drink.\nGood decision making.\nWell, I read all\nof Feynman's books.\nSo I had the pleasure\nI never met him.\nHe was dead before I was born.\nBut my dad did.\nAnd he had good Feynman stories\nand they were inappropriate.\nSo the cool thing about Feynman\nwas that he didn't really\ncare if people understood\nthe specifics of what\nhe was talking about.\nHe just wanted\npeople to get turned\non to how amazing physics was.\nAnd he loved general principles.\nAnd one of the\nthings-- the example\nthat sometimes given out.\nI don't know how many of you're\nfamiliar with the Feynman\nbooks.\nBut surely, you're\njoking Mr Feynman\nor what do you care what other\npeople think, all of that\nstuff it's wonderful.\nHe picked locks.\nWhen he worked at\nLos Alamos Labs,\nthey were working on the bomb.\nAnd he basically-- well,\nthere and elsewhere.\nAnd every morning the\noffices used to come in\nand he would spread all the top\nsecret papers out on the floor.\nHe would break into\nthe safes at night.\nAnd then they were\nperplexed who could do this.\nAnd he liked safe cracking.\nLiterally like national\nsecurity secrets just\nfor fun, prankster.\nHe also bongo drummed naked\non the roof of Caltech.\nAnd he did most of his writing\nof theorems in strip clubs,\nin fact.\nLearnt to draw late\nin life, was really\ninto flotation tanks,\nand very curious about\nbut never did psychedelics.\nThat's as I understand.\nBut one of the cool\nFeynman factoids\nis that when he\nwas a kid, he talks\nabout when he was a\nchild that his dad used\nto take him birdwatching.\nAnd he'd say, oh, well\nthat's a whatever scrub jay\nand that's whatever thrush and\nthat's the-- and his dad said,\nno don't cloud your mind\nwith naming and taxonomy.\nThat's not meaningful.\nBecause then what\nif it's different?\nThe pigmy thrush or the\nlesser or this or that.\nThe more important\nthing is to start\nto identify principles of\nwhy certain birds behave\none way and certain\nbirds behave another.\nAnd to start finding\nthe commonalities\nand the regularities.\nAnd that's a theme that\nI obviously tonight\nhave tried to impose.\nAnd it's actually something\nthat I can't do in podcasts,\nnecessarily because I can't\nthread across 40 episodes.\nOr something like\nthat in the same way\nthat I could in an\nevening like this.\nSo that's an appropriate\nFeynman story.\nAlso he just seemed\nlike a delightful guy.\nAnd he's kind of cool.\nHe's a little bit street,\nhe had the thick accent.\nHe was from Far Rockaway, but\nhe didn't really care much what\npeople thought, or he did\nand he pretended he didn't.\nCare for when\npeople tell you they\ndon't care what people think.\nI think he did to the extent\nthat it still allowed him\nto get the message out there.\nOK, next question please.\nMy horse.\nWow.\nI love this.\nI delight in all things\nanimals, but especially horses,\nbecause my high school\ngirlfriend had a horse.\nAnd they do that thing where\npeople go, oh you know, horses\ncan detect how-- they know\nmore about you than you know.\nAnd then I get onto the horse,\nand the horse like this this\nand this.\nAnd it's like a litmus test.\nHaving a girlfriend with a horse\nwas very intimidating for me\nactually.\nI felt like I had to\ncompete with the horse.\nShe spent all this time with\nthe horse, it's very large.\nAnyway, eventually\nI broke the horse.\nOK, my horse does the double\ninhale, long exhale often.\nHe's a bit of a stressed guy.\nWarm blood?\nYeah, warm blood.\nI used to work at the barn.\nI used to shovel manure\nand work at the barn.\nShe brought her\nhorse to college. .\nI actually followed\nher off to college\nI never would have\ngone to college\nif she hadn't gone to college.\nAnd the horses are\ninteresting animals.\nThey do tell you a lot.\nThe horse does the double\ninhale, long exhale often.\nHe's a bit of a stress guy.\nDo you suppose this\nphysiological stress regulator\ntranscends species?\nAbsolutely.\nIn fact, I mentioned warm blood.\nI have a colleague at\nStanford and she's amazing.\nHer name is Sue\nMcConnell and she\nis an expert in dog\ngenetics, so you\ncan imagine I'm always\nasking her questions.\nAnd we talk about dogs and we\ntalk about horses because she\nalso--\nI thinks she raises warm bloods.\nAnd you hear about hot\nbloods and warm bloods.\nAnd also, if you have any\nfamiliarity with dogs,\nthere are dogs like Costello,\nor like a nuclear bomb\ncould go off and Costello\nmight open an eye.\nThat's the bulldog,\neconomy of effort.\nThey're not going to get\nactivated unless there's\na reason to do it.\nThey are very, as we call\nit, parasympathetic dominant.\nThat seesaw of autonomic\narousal is just really relaxed.\nGetting them into action\nis more of an effort.\nThere are other animals\nlike the whippet\nor the Italian greyhound.\nLike they're always cold, that\nare very sympathetic dominant.\nAnd then of course, within\na breed or within a species\nthere's a range.\nAnd humans also,\nare within a range.\nI think anyone who's had\nchildren will tell you he\nor she has been like\nthis since birth.\nCalm, easygoing, or like\nreally easily stressed.\nI think that seesaw, we didn't\nget into tonight too much.\nBut there's a concept with\nthe autonomic regulation\nof a hinge.\nSo don't think so much\nabout being really stressed\nout or really relaxed.\nBut certain animals,\nthe hinge is\ntighten so that the\nseesaw just kind of tilts\nmellow like Costello.\nA bulldog almost seems\nlike a different animal\nthan a whippet.\nThey're so very different.\nAnd within the\ncategory of horses--\nand I'm not an expert\nin horse genetics,\nbut they are\nselected for not just\nfor their physical attributes,\nbut for their psychological or\ntemperament attributes.\nAnd you see this in dogs too.\nIn fact, the reason\nI picked Costello,\nand Elvis can verify\nthe stories, I read--\nI wanted a dog\nfor so many years.\nAnd I went there and there\nwere all these puppies.\nAnd I was like I heard you need\nto take them in the other room\none by one.\nAnd then if it barks for\nits siblings, you're like,\noh it's a healthy puppy.\nSo I walk in and all the dogs\nare running around like crazy.\nIt was right around\nChristmas time, right Elvis?\nAnd they're running around and\nthen there's one in the back.\nAnd he's taking\nadvantage of the fact\nthat all the other\nones are running.\nHe's just eating out\nof all of their bowls.\nAnd I was like, I want that one.\nSo I took that chubby little\nbastard in the next room\nand I thought, OK, he's going\nto bark for his siblings.\nAnd he lay down\nand he took a nap.\nAnd I was like, this one.\nI want this one.\nWhy did I want that one?\nWell, this completes\nthe principle\nwhich is, I wanted a dog like\nthat because I'm not like that.\nAnd I was very interested in\na dog I could take care of,\nbut also a dog that would help\nregulate my nervous system.\nAnd so for me having\na dog like that\nas opposed to a\nwhippet or something\nthat was going constantly\naround is a very calming effect.\nAnd to this day memory of his\nsnoring still puts me to sleep.\nSo I think that your\nhorse probably has--\nit kind of idles a\nlittle bit higher.\nThink about the rpm.\nYou know, revs a little bit\nhigher at a given speed--\nmore rpm at a given speed.\nThat's the way I think\nabout the autonomic system.\nHow do you reset that?\nWell, this is why a lot of\nexercise is good, right?\nAnd certainly my\ngirlfriend's horse was crazy.\nIt was gelded late.\nAnd it was crazy.\nI almost said nuts but\nthat's like a bad pun\nso it was not nuts\nbut it was crazy.\nIt was gelded late.\nNext question.\nIs there any science behind\nstaying motivated or developing\ndiscipline?\nOh, so this represents\nthe higher tier\nof where I think\nthings are going\nto go in the next\nfew years, where\nwe're going to start seeing\nthis convergence of psychology\nand biology, where we can\nget to these harder concepts.\nI like to think that\nwe can stay motivated\nthrough a simple process that\nnow will make sense to you.\nBecause the last thing I covered\nwas toggling back and forth\nbetween our ability to\nbe gritty and linen,\nkind of in friction, maybe\neven a little anger, fear,\ncompetitiveness, et cetera.\nThat kind of grinding in.\nBut that the more\nsustaining fuel,\nthe sort of hybrid version,\na hybrid fuel model\nwould be one in which\nyou can access that.\nBut that's a depletable\nand not so renewable\nresource without a lot of rest.\nMeaning, working hard out of\nanger, determination, and kind\nof grit will work, but\nwhen you are depleted\nyou have to stop\nfor a long while.\nWhereas if you can access\nthis delight system,\nwhich is really one of\ndopamine and serotonin, both.\nIn other words, and I want\nto think of a different way\nto put this, but to try\nand think about what\nsorts of things and tools allow\nyou to be and feel most loving,\nI know it sounds weak.\nBut it's anything\nbut weak to be most\nloving in the verb sense of the\nword toward what you're doing.\nI actually used to use\nthis trick in college when\nI'd encounter a topic I hated.\nI would tell myself I'm really--\nI'm just going to\nfall in love with this\nby trying to find\nthe gems within it.\nSometimes it worked.\nSometimes it didn't.\nBut the wish to do it\nthat way as opposed to OK,\nI'm just going to\ngrind this out,\nat least for me at the\ntime was a powerful tool.\nSo motivation and--\ndiscipline is a tricky one.\nThat's sort of the\njust do it thing.\nYou need tools to modulate your\nstress and to get your sleep--\ndo all the basic things right.\nSet the right context for\nyou to be in your best\nchance of being disciplined.\nAnd that itself is its\nown form of discipline.\nBut in terms of\ncontinual motivation\nyou're not going to manage to\ngo against the grain for very\nlong.\nPeople have managed to\ngo against challenge\nfor a very long time--\nfor a very long times.\nIn fact, I was reading recently\nabout the psychology of people\nwho've been kidnapped.\nAnd they have this odd\ntrick that they used.\nHave you heard about this\nis sort of like Stockholm\nsyndrome?\nBut they actually convinced\nthemselves to fall in love\nwith their captors.\nAnd then they come up with\nnew ways to escape them,\nwhich is kind of cool.\nSo there's something\nabout mentally feeling\nlike you're trying to go\nfrom back on your heels\nto flat footed.\nThat's very\nenergetically costly.\nSo again, these systems are\nvery susceptible to what we call\ncontext or top down regulation.\nHopefully that helps.\nI know it's a\nlittle bit abstract.\nI wish I could give\nyou a 1-minute exercise\nor make you motivated.\nBut we do talk about tools to\nget adrenaline going and things\nlike that.\nBut spend some time\nthinking about what\nwould allow you\nto sustain effort\nthrough positive feelings.\nIt's not a light concept at all.\nNext question please.\nWhat would be your\nbiggest piece of advice\nfor achieving one's dreams?\nBoy!\nThat's a tough one.\nAgain, this is going to\nbe a little abstract.\nI'm a believer in this idea\nkind of a seed message.\nRobert Greene has\ntalked a lot about this,\nthat we can all kind of\nthink back to a event\nor stage of our life.\nTypically it's before\npuberty for other reasons\nthat are kind of interesting.\nBut where we delight\nin something.\nSo for me it was fish.\nAnd obviously now I don't\nneed to work on fish.\nIt wasn't about the fish.\nI hope that came through.\nI mean aquaria are really cool,\nbut it's not about the fish.\nIt was something about\nthe way they moved.\nIt was something about the way\nthat it tickled my excitement.\nI used to get dropped off\nat this little pet shop\nin California Avenue\ncalled Monette's Pet Shop.\nAnd my mom used it as childcare.\nShe would drop me off\nthere and I had this book\nand I would log all\nthe tropical fish,\nand which ones could be with\nwhich ones, and then I would--\nI was obsessed.\nBut for me it was\nsomething about organizing\nand being able to make\nreliable predictions.\nIt was about parsimony.\nIt was about principles\nas opposed to--\nand the colors delighted me\nand all that kind of stuff.\nThe equipment delighted\nme, but then I hit puberty.\nAnd then it was something else.\nAnd then I went to college\nand it was something else.\nAnd I got a girlfriend\nand it was something else.\nSo it changes over time.\nBut this is why I recommend to\nthat young 15-year-old person\nthat they learn to tap into that\nsense of like Oh, this is cool.\nLike this feels cool.\nI know not everyone\nelse thinks it's cool.\nMaybe they do.\nLike this feels good.\nI actually have a somatic\nexperience of this.\nI'm not a very semantically\noriented person.\nI'm more up here.\nBut I actually know if\nI'm on to something,\nif this left arm just\nkind of starts fidgeting,\nit's like I want to move\nor like some people--\nyou can start to identify\nways in which you suddenly\nhave this positive energy.\nIt's not a fear energy.\nIt's almost like a\nmagnetism to things.\nAnd just don't be\nconfused or misdirected\nin thinking that\nit's that thing.\nIt's that energy or that\nattraction to something\nthat feels right that is your--\nI wish we had these\ndivining rod to find water.\nThat's your tool.\nIt's like antennae, you\nwant to grow your antennae.\nSo how do you\nfollow your dreams?\nWell, I never thought\nI'd do a podcast.\nI never thought I'd\nbecome a neuroscientist.\nYou have to be willing\nof course, to take risks\nand to iterate quickly,\nbut not so quickly\nthat you fail out of\nthe game, et cetera,\nif you do get back\nin, et cetera.\nBut it's really about\ndeveloping an awareness.\nNow, the key thing is you're\nnot going to find this\nby going up a mountain and\nsitting there or waiting\nfor your passion to\njust kind of rock it in,\nor piano fall onto your head.\nIt's not going to\nhappen that way.\nYou have to interact\nwith the sensory world\nand different kinds of people.\nAnd you have to be a little bit\nof a adventurer in a safe way,\nof course.\nAn adventure and learn\nto recognize the signals.\nAnd some people are\nvery in tune with this.\nThere's an amazing podcast\nwith Rick Rubin recently\non Joe Rogan's\nPodcast where he talks\nabout the creative processes.\nKind of this-- it\nseems like whatever's\ngoing on in that beard of his\njust connects to the world.\nAnd he can just like--\nthere, that's where you\nneed to go and that's--\nBut that's part of the magic,\nis you don't really know.\nAnd because it's all energetic--\nit's all energetic.\nAnd when I say\nenergetic, I don't\nmean in the mystical sense.\nI mean you have\nto learn to sense\nthose fluctuations in energy.\nSome people can sense\nthem very easily\nbecause they're very mellow.\nAnd if something gets\nthem really excited\nthey notice as a big delta, as\nwe say in science, big change.\nOther people they ride\nkind of high all the time.\nAnd so everything\nis exciting to them,\nand they miss a lot of\nthe subtle fluctuations\nin what's really special\nand right for them.\nIn fact, mania is\ncharacterized by hyper\nelevated levels of dopamine\nand everything is a good idea.\nAnd depression is the opposite.\nNothing is a good idea.\nNothing's going to work.\nAnd those are the extremes.\nAnd those are rough\nconditions obviously.\nBut for most people,\nit's about learning\nto detect those\nsubtle fluctuations.\nAnd every time-- every single\ntime you find somebody who is\nexceptional at their craft\nand doing well in life--\nthere are a lot of people who\nare exceptional at their craft,\nbut not necessarily\ndoing well on the whole.\nThose people have a\nkind of intuition about\nwhat feels good to them.\nThis year's Nobel Prize\nwinner in chemistry\nis my colleague,\nCarolyn Bertozzi.\nAnd all I know of\nher, except the fact\nthat she's an amazing\nchemist, is they\ndid this interview with her.\nAnd she said that when everyone\nwould go out in college\nshe was finding excuses\nto stay home and read\norganic chemistry.\nNow, that to me sounds\nlike a bad night.\nBut for her it was pure delight.\nAnd she's wired for that.\nAnd I think her\nwork is going to be\nvitally important and\ntransformative for humanity.\nI really do.\nSo how do you succeed\nin chasing your dreams?\nYou succeed in\nidentifying what they are.\nBut you don't know\nat the outset.\nYou want to find the energy\nto find the right path\nand continually course correct\nwhen you will undoubtedly\nbe off your path.\nThat's essentially\nwhat I've done.\nI still look for the\nfeeling of delighting\nin Costello or the cuttlefish.\nThat's what I'm looking for.\nIt's not a template I have to\nmatch, but that's my like, oh,\nyeah I know what\nthat feels like.\nIt's like a texture.\nIt's like if you think about\na bunch of different textures\nof sandpaper, it's like this\none that just feels really good.\nAnd so you're comparing\neverything to that,\nbecause the system that\ninvolves all these chemicals,\nyou'll find it if you learn\nto pay attention to it.\nBut you won't find it sitting,\nstaring at your belly button\nor going up a mountain.\nYou have to be in sensory\nexperience in order to find it.\nReflection is good but you\nneed to get into action.\nWow.\nAll right well.\nOK, so psilocybin.\nOpinion of the psychedelics.\nGenerally, we just had an\nepisode with my colleague Nolan\nWilliams, who's a triple\nboard certified neurologist\npsychiatrist.\nIt's a fun thing about\nworking at Stanford.\nIt's also very humbling\nbecause you're like,\nwhoa who are these people?\nThey have three\nboard certifications.\nThe psilocybin-- first of\nall, not for everybody.\nPeople with psychosis,\nit is still illegal\ndecriminalized in\ncertain places.\nSo obviously the\ncautionary notes\npeople who have drug addiction\nissues or other kinds\nof addiction issues need to\nbe thoughtful about diving\ninto a neurochemical\nlandscape like that.\nBut it does appear that\nthe clinical trials\non one macro dose.\nThis is what's\ninteresting to me.\nA lot of people talk about\nmicro-dosing psilocybin,\nbut the data at least according\nto Matthew Johnson, who is also\non the podcast, the\ndata for micro-dosing\nare not really there, frankly.\nThe data on single session macro\ndose, the sort of heroic doses\nthat have been talked about\nin the psychonaut community\nfor a depression and\nto some extent PTSD,\nand for eating disorders and\nsort of end of life preparation\nare quite encouraging.\nIn fact, the current data\nsuggests that about 2/3\nof people achieve lasting\nrelief from one session.\nNow, keep in mind those are\nguided sessions with physicians\nin the room, et cetera.\nI do think there's a potential\nhazard of all psychedelics,\nwhich is they alter--\nthis includes MDMA\nor especially MDMA,\nthey alter the chemical\nlandscape in you,\nsuch that a lot of\nthings can serve\nas attractors in that state.\nMeaning you can get really into\nthe sound of music in an MDMA\nsession, feel connected\nto that, and waste\nthe opportunity for some more\nmeaningful transformative\nrewiring.\nAnd I do think that's\nworth paying attention to.\nSo that's the usefulness of\nhaving a therapeutic guide,\nas they can continually\nsteer you back to what\nat least for you is the\nmore meaningful work.\nBut it's very encouraging.\nAnd Nolan Williams,\nwho I trust, is again\ntriple board certified M.D. Said\nthat in the studies of lifetime\nperceived individual and\nsocietal risk, of all\nthe compounds out there\nexcept for caffeine,\npsilocybin is at the\nbottom of the list.\nWhereas things like\nheroin, cocaine, alcohol,\nmethamphetamine sit at\nthe top of the list.\nActually, alcohol quite high\non that list at certain amounts\nof consumption.\nSo I'm very excited\nabout what's happening\nin the landscape of\npsilocybin, but I'm not\nso excited about the\nmicro-dosing data.\nVery excited about the\nsingle heroic dose data.\nOne interesting\nthing there perhaps,\nwhat seems to be\nthe unifying feature\nof a successful psilocybo--\npsilocybin, excuse me session,\nis that at some point\nthe person feels\nas if it's like too much\nof a autonomic thing.\nIt kind of get to\nthis point and then\nthey are encouraged to \"let go.\"\nAnd I'm fascinated\nby this concept\nof letting go, because\nI'm a neuroscientist.\nWe don't know what\nthat means, but it\nseems like being able to ride\nthe wave of autonomic arousal\nfrom top to bottom.\nSeems to be very powerful\nfor trauma and depression\ntreatment.\nAnd this is interesting.\nA lot of people think that one\nof the major issues in humans\nnowadays is we're stressed\nabout a lot of things.\nBut we never actually get to go\ninto the full stress response,\nand then let it relax again.\nAnd catharsis was\nbig at one point.\nScream therapy, Steve Jobs\nis going to scream therapies.\nThat whether or not catharsis is\nhealthy or not has been debated\nbut the data are kind\nof pointing to the fact\nthat it may be provided\nthat the catharsis is not.\nObviously someone damaging\nthemselves for somebody else.\nSo maybe we should all\nbe screaming a lot more.\nWhy does my desire\nto eat disappear\nafter I use the sauna?\nOh, interesting.\nI can go in hungry and get\nout with no desire to eat.\nI can only speculate.\nThe sauna or any kind of\ndeliberate heat exposure\nthat's uncomfortable releases\nthis molecule dynorphin.\nThis is actually\nthe same molecule\nthat's released under conditions\nof alcohol withdrawal.\nIt makes you feel\nagitated and not good.\nAnd then there's this rebound.\nThe way it feels\ngood is later, it\ncauses this upregulation in the\nso-called mu opioid receptors.\nSo the chemicals that you\nhave, your so-called endogenous\nopioids, not the\nopioids that are\nrelated to the opioid crisis.\nBut the ones that\nyou naturally make\nare able to have a more\nrobust effect after the sauna.\nDynorphin is an\nappetite suppressant\nand for reasons related to\nkind of general discomfort\nin the body.\nSo that's the only\nreason I can speculate.\nThere are a number\nof other things\nthat sauna does including\nmassive increases in growth\nhormone provided you\ndon't sauna too much.\nSo if you do it once a week\nfour 20-minute sessions spaced\nfive minutes apart, you get\nthese enormous increases\nin growth hormone.\nIf you start doing\nit more often you\nget still significant,\nbut smaller increases\nin growth hormone.\nAnd my team, this is how\nthe podcast goes too.\nAt some point Rob just\ngoes, it's enough.\nSo if you think the\nepisodes are long now,\nthey'd be a lot longer.\nListen, I just want\nto-- before we part,\nI know it's a Sunday night\nand people have to go,\nI want to thank everyone\nfor coming out tonight.\nI know that at least for me\nI'm still sort of baffled,\nbut pleasantly so that people\nare interested in investing\ntime to come out and hear\nhours of a nerd like me\nand talk about\nscience and tools.\nAnd I'm delighted that\npeople are hopefully gleaning\nsome useful information.\nPlease do pass along\nthe information.\nI didn't invent this stuff\nas I mentioned before.\nI was not consulted\non the design phase.\nI have no domain over it.\nThis is the stuff\nof mother nature.\nAnd whatever other beliefs\nyou have, they're here in us.\nAnd of course, I'd be remiss\nif I didn't finish by saying,\nhave a wonderful\nnight and thank you\nfor your interest in science.\nAUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]"
