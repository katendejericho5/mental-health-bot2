    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is\nDr. Layne Norton.\nDr. Norton is one of\nthe foremost experts\nin protein metabolism,\nfat loss, and nutrition.\nHe did his degrees in\nbiochemistry and nutritional\nsciences and is considered\none of the world experts\nin understanding how we\nextract energy from our food\nand how exercise and what we\neat combine to impact things\nlike body composition\nand overall health.\nToday, we discuss an\nenormous number of topics\nunder the umbrella of\nnutrition and fitness,\nincluding, for instance,\nwhat is energy balance?\nThat is, how do we actually\nextract energy from our food?\nWe also discuss the\nsomewhat controversial topic\nof artificial sweeteners,\nwhether or not\nthey are safe or not\nand whether or not\nthey are an effective\ntool for weight loss,\nin particular, for\npeople suffering\nfrom obesity and different\ntypes of diabetes.\nWe also talk about gut health--\nthat is the gut microbiome--\nand how it's impacted\nby food and how\nit can actually impact the\nmetabolism of the foods\nthat we eat.\nWe also discuss fasting, or\nso-called intermittent fasting\nor time-restricted\nfeeding, what it does\nand what it does not do in\nterms of how effective it\nis for weight loss and, perhaps,\neven for health and longevity.\nWe also talk about protein\nand define very clearly\nhow much protein each\nand all of us need,\ndepending on our daily\nactivities and life demands.\nWe discuss the\nvarious types of diets\nthat you've probably\nheard about,\nincluding ketogenic diets,\nvegan diets, vegetarian diets,\nand pure carnivore diets, as\nwell as more typical omnivore\ndiets, and how to\nmake sure that you\nget all of the\nessential amino acids\nthat are critical for healthy\nweight maintenance, weight\nloss, or directed muscle gain.\nWe also talk about supplements,\nin particular, the supplements\nfor which there is an immense\namount of science pointing\nto their safety and\nefficacy for fitness\nand for overall\nbody composition.\nWhat I'm sure will\nbecome clear to you,\nas you hear Layne\ntalk about each\nand every one of\nthese topics, is\nthat he has an incredible\nability to both understand\nthe mechanistic science\nbut also the real world\napplications of the various\ndiscoveries that are made\nin particular papers\nand, in particular,\nin the randomized\ncontrolled trials.\nThat is when a given scientific\nhypothesis has been raised.\nHe's extremely good at\nunderstanding why it was raised\nbut also at evaluating\nwhether or not\nit works in the\nreal world, which\nis what I believe most everybody\nout there is concerned with.\nI think this is one of\nthe things that really\ndistinguishes him\nfrom the other voices\nin the nutritional landscape.\nI assure you that by the\nend of today's discussion,\nyou will have a much clearer\nunderstanding about what\nthe science says about\nnutrition, about fitness,\nand about how different diets\nand fitness programs combine\nto achieve the\nresults that you want.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nwith everything you need\nand nothing that you don't.\nThat means it contains\nsodium, potassium,\nand magnesium, the so-called\nelectrolytes, but no sugar.\nAs you may have heard\nme discuss before\non this podcast, every\ncell in our body,\nand in particular\ncells within our brain,\nthe so-called neurons\nor nerve cells,\ncritically rely on the\npresence of electrolytes--\nsodium, magnesium, and\npotassium-- in order\nto function properly.\nI, myself, am a big believer\nin consuming electrolytes\nany time I've been\nsweating a lot,\nso that could be\nafter during exercise\nor after doing the sauna.\nSo by drinking electrolytes in\nthe form of LMNT electrolyte\nmix, I'm able to replenish\nthose electrolytes\nand maintain mental clarity\nand energy throughout the day.\nLMNT contains a science\nback to electrolyte\nratio of 1,000 milligrams\nof sodium, 200 milligrams\nof potassium, and 60\nmilligrams of magnesium.\nIf you'd like to try an LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt--\nspelled L-M-N-T-- .com/huberman\nto get a free sample pack with\nyour purchase.\nAgain, that's\ndrinkL-M-N-T.com/huberman\nto get the free sample pack.\nToday's, episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses\nand sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford.\nAnd everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with\nperformance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology, the visual system,\nand I can tell you that\nyour visual system has\nto contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges in order\nfor you to see clearly,\nfor instance, when you move\nfrom a sunny area\nto a shady area\nand back again, whether or not\nyou're looking at something up\nclose or often to the distance.\nROKA understands the\nbiology of the visual system\nand has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses\naccordingly so you always\nsee with perfect clarity.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially\ndesigned for activities\nsuch as running and cycling.\nAnd indeed, they are\nvery lightweight.\nMost of the time, I\ncan't even remember\nthat they're on my face.\nThey're so lightweight.\nBut the important thing to\nknow about ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses is\nthat while they\ncan be used during\nsports activities,\nthey also have a\nterrific aesthetic\nand they can be used just as\nwell for wearing to work or out\nto dinner, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou can go to roka--\nthat's R-O-K-A--\n.com and enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off on your first\norder.\nAgain, that's roka-- R-O-K-A--\n.com and enter the code\nHuberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition program\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nNow, I've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood\nwork done for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed with\na quality blood test.\nOne of the major issues\nwith a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there, however, is\nthat you get information back\nabout levels of hormones,\nlevels of lipids,\nlevels of metabolic\nfactors, but you\ndon't know what to do\nabout that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they\nhave an easy-to-use platform\nthat allows you to\nassess those levels\nand then determine what\nsorts of behavioral changes\nand nutritional changes,\nmaybe, even supplementation\nchanges you might\nwant to make in order\nto bring those numbers\ninto the ranges that\nare optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can go

supplements.\nTo find the supplements we\ndiscuss on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, you can go to\nlivemomentous-- spelled O-U-S--\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just\nmention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now, for my discussion\nwith Dr. Layne Norton.\nLayne, Dr. Norton, thank\nyou so much for being here.\nThis is a long time coming.\nAnd I have to say, I'm really\nexcited because I've seen you\nin the social media sphere.\nI've also listened to a\nnumber of your other podcasts.\nAnd as a fellow PhD scientist,\nI feel a great kinship with you.\nI know you have\ntremendous experience\nin fitness and nutrition,\na number of areas.\nWe also got a lot of\nquestions from our audience.\nAnd I'm really looking forward\nto talking with you today.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah,\nI'm excited, too.\nI mean, like you said,\nit's been something\nwe've been talking\nabout for a long time.\nSo I was glad we were\nable to make it happen.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, indeed.\nAnd I think some\nof the audience has\nrequested a debate or a battle.\nAnd I can tell you right now,\nit's not going to happen.\nActually, one of the things that\nbrought Layne and I together,\nin conversation online and\nthen via text, et cetera,\nwas the fact that I\nlove to be corrected,\nand that's what happened.\nI did a post about\nartificial sweeteners, which\nwe will talk about a little\nbit later in the episode,\nand Layne pointed out some areas\nof the study that I had missed\nor, maybe, even misunderstood.\nAnd I revised my opinions\nand I think it's wonderful.\nAnd other studies have\ncome out since then.\nSo hopefully, our\nconversation will\nserve as a message of how\nscience and actionable science\ncan be perceived and\nthat it doesn't always\nhave to be a battle.\nBut hey, if we get into\nit, we get into it.\nIt won't get physical because\nwe know you would win.\nSo in any case, I'd like\nto start with something\nthat's rather basic and\nyet can be pretty complex,\nand that's this issue of energy\nbalance and energy utilization.\nI think most people\nhave heard of a calorie.\nI am assuming that most\npeople don't actually\nknow what that is in\nterms of how it works,\nwhat it represents.\nAnd so maybe you\ncould just explain\nfor people what happens when\nwe eat food, of any kind,\nand how is that\nactually converted\ninto energy, as a way of framing\nup the discussion around weight\nloss, weight maintenance, weight\ngain, and body composition.\nLAYNE NORTON: So it's\na great question.\nAnd like you said, this is one\nof those things where people\nuse the term calories\nin, calories out,\nand they say, well,\nthat's way too simplistic.\nI'm like, if you look at what\nactually makes up calories in,\ncalories out, it's\nactually very complicated.\nSo let's deal with what\nyou mentioned first.\nWhat is the calorie?\nBecause I think a lot of people\ndon't quite understand this.\nSo a calorie just refers to\na unit of energy, of heat\nspecifically.\nAnd so what does that\nhave to do with food?\nWhat does that have to do\nwith what we digest and eat?\nReally, what you're\ntalking about\nis the potential\nchemical energy that\nis in the bonds of the\nmacronutrients of food.\nAnd by digesting,\nassimilating, and metabolizing\nthose nutrients, we\nare able to create\nenergy and the in-product\nof that, mostly,\nis ATP, adenosine triphosphate,\nwhich is your body's energy\ncurrency.\nSo to understand ATP,\njust try to think about--\nif you're trying to power\nthese various reactions\nin your body--\nand we're talking\nabout tens of thousands\nof enzymes that require ATP--\nit doesn't make\nsense that you would\nhave to create a bunch\nof micro explosions.\nYou want something that can\ntransfer high-energy phosphates\nto power these\nreactions, to give up\nessentially its energy\nto power something\nthat might otherwise\nbe unfavorable.\nSo a lot of metabolism\nis simply creating\nATP, which the end\nof the line of that--\nI'm going to work\nbackwards-- is what's\ncalled oxidative respiration.\nSo that happens in\nthe mitochondria.\nEverybody's heard mitochondria,\na powerhouse of the cell.\nAnd that is done through\nessentially creating a hydrogen\nion gradient across\nthe mitochondria, which\npowers the production\nof ATP by converting\nfree phosphate plus ATP to ADP.\nNow the way that hydrogen\nion gradient is created\nis through creating hydrogen\nions that can be donated\nthrough the Krebs cycle.\nNow the Krebs cycle is\nlinked to glycolysis.\nSo if we talk about\ncarbohydrate metabolism,\ncarbohydrates basically,\nother than fructose,\nget converted into glucose,\nwhich can go into glycolysis,\nand you can produce some\nATPs through glycolysis.\nAnd then it boils\ndown to pyruvate,\nthen acetyl-CoA, which\ngoes to the Krebs cycle,\nproduces a lot more\nATPs from that.\nIf you talk about\nprotein, protein\nis a little bit different\nbecause protein gets converted\nto amino acids,\nwhich can be used\nfor muscle protein\nsynthesis or protein\nsynthesis in other tissues.\nBut it also can be converted\nthrough gluconeogenesis\nto glucose.\nAnd there also are some\nketogenic amino acids as well.\nAnd so you can have\na few different ways\nto get to the Krebs cycle.\nEither being through\nacetyl-CoA or through\nglucose going through the\nglycolysis to pyruvate.\nThen you have fatty acids,\nwhich are able to create energy\nthrough what's called beta\noxidation where, essentially,\nyou're taking these fatty\nacids and you're lopping them\noff two carbons at a time\nto produce acetyl-CoA which,\nagain, can go into\nthe Krebs cycle,\nproduce those hydrogen\nions that can then\npower the production of ATP.\nSo that's kind of like\nat the cellular level\nof how this stuff works.\nBut stepping back and\ntaking it back out,\nwhat does that have to do with\nweight loss or weight gain?\nWell, when you think about\nthe balance of energy\nin versus energy out.\nSounds very simple.\nBut let's look at\nwhat actually makes up\nenergy in versus energy out.\nFirst of all, you've\ngot to realize\nthat the energy\ninside of the equation\nis more difficult to\ntrack than people think.\nSo one, food labels,\nwhich we like\nto think as being\nfrom upon high,\ncan have up to a\n20% error in them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Really?\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo a 100 calorie--\nsomething listed as 100\ncalories per serving,\nit could-- what's actually\nin there could be 80 or 120.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nExactly.\nSo that's one aspect of it.\nThe second aspect is there's\nwhat's called your energy,\nbut then there's also\nmetabolizable energy.\nSo if you have food stuff with\nsay, a lot of insoluble fiber,\ntypically, insoluble fiber\nis not really digestible,\nand so you could have \"quite\na bit of carbohydrate,\" know\nbut if you can't extract\nthe energy from it--\nand typically, this is\nbecause insoluble fiber\nfrom plant material, the\ncarbohydrate and even\nsome of the protein is bound up\nin the plant structure, which\nmakes it inaccessible\nto digestive enzymes.\nAnd so this is what adds bulk\nto your stool and whatnot.\nBut again, reduces the\nmetabolizable energy in there.\nAnd there's some\nevidence that based\non people's individual gut\nmicrobiome, that some people\nmay actually be better at\nextracting energy out of fiber\ncompared to other people.\nSo just starting\noff right there,\nOK, there's quite a bit of play\nin the energy inside of things.\nNow, one of the\nthings people will say\nis, well, see that's\nwhy you shouldn't worry\nabout tracking calories, because\nthe food levels can be 20% off.\nAnd what I'll say is, OK.\nI understand where\nyou're coming from.\nBut typically, if it's off, it's\ngoing to be consistently off.\nAnd if you're consistent\nwith how you track it,\neventually, you'll be able to\nknow what you're taking in.\nAnd that's like saying, well,\ndon't worry about tracking\nif you're--\nI like to use\nfinancial examples.\nWe know that to\nsave money, you have\nto earn more money\nthan you spend.\nWell, you can't exactly\nknow how much money\nyou're earning at a time\nbecause there's inflation\nand then there is--\nif you have investments, those\ncan be different interest rates\nand whatnot.\nIt's like, OK, if\nyou have a budget,\nyou have a reasonable idea\nof what it's going to be.\nAnd you make\ncertain assumptions,\nbut you can relatively guess.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nThat's a good example.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nSo now, let's look\nat the energy outside\nof the equation, which is\nactually way more complicated.\nAnd so your energy out is\na few different buckets.\nThe first one and\nthe biggest one\nis your resting metabolic rate.\nSo your RMR.\nAnd that, for most people,\nis anywhere from 50% to 70%\nof your total daily\nenergy expenditure.\nNow, people use the term\nmetabolic rate and energy\nexpenditure interchangeably,\nbut they're not the same thing.\nSo your total daily\nenergy expenditure\nis the summation of all the\nenergy you expend in a day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWalking upstairs,\nexercise if you do it--\nLAYNE NORTON: Fidgeting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nPlus your resting\nmetabolic rate.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nSo resting metabolic rate\nis a big part of that,\nbut it's not the only thing.\nSo that's usually\nabout 50% to 70%.\nAnd sedentary people will be\non the higher end of that.\nSo it'll be a bigger\nproportion whereas people\nwho are more active, it'll\nbe a little bit lower, not\nbecause their metabolic\nrate is lower,\nbut because they're\nexpending a greater\npercentage of their calories\nfrom physical activity.\nThen you have something\ncalled the thermic effect\nof food, which is a\nrelatively small percentage\nof your total daily\nenergy expenditure.\nIt's about 5% to 10%.\nAnd very difficult to\nmeasure and usually\nwhat researchers do when\nthey're looking at this stuff is\nthey just make an\nassumption about it.\nThey use a constant.\nBut that's about 5% to 10% of\nyour daily energy expenditure.\nAnd that refers to\nthe amount of energy\nit takes to extract\nthe energy out of food.\nSo think about your\nbody like a car.\nYou don't just have\ngas in your tank\nand it spontaneously starts up.\nYou have to have a battery\nso you put in energy so you\ncan get the energy\nout of the petrol\nthat you have in your car.\nSimilar with food, you\ncan't just eat food\nand then it just\nappears in your cells\nand you start doing stuff.\nIt has to be\nsystematically broken\ndown and put into forms that\ncan actually produce energy.\nAnd so you have to put some\nenergy in to achieve that.\nAnd a lot of times,\npeople will say something\nlike, well, not all\ncalories are created equal.\nThat's not true, because calorie\nis just a unit of measurement.\nThat would be like saying\nnot all seconds on a clock\nare created equal.\nYes, they are.\nAll sources of calories may have\ndifferential effects on energy\nexpenditure and appetite.\nSo if we look at something\nlike fat, for example,\nthe TEF of fat is\nabout 0% to 3%.\nMeaning, if you eat\n100 calories from fat,\nyour net will be\nabout 97 to 100.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So the\nprocess of breaking down\nthat fat, essentially,\nsubtracts some of the calories\naway because you used\nit in creating energy--\nLAYNE NORTON: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --by\nbreaking those chemical bonds\nto create ATP.\nLAYNE NORTON: Correct.\nCorrect.\nSo you have like, for example,\nsome enzymes that require\nATP to run these processes.\nNow, fat is actually the easiest\nthing to convert into energy.\nThen you have\ncarbohydrate, which\nhas a TEF of like 5% to 10%.\nSo you eat 100 calories\nfrom carbohydrate.\nAnd obviously, the fiber content\nmakes a big difference on this.\nBut if you eat 100\ncalories, you'll net 92 95.\nProtein is about\na 20% to 30% TEF.\nSo if you eat\ncalories from protein,\nyou're only netting 70 to 80.\nNow, you're still net--\npeople say, well, you\ncan't eat too much protein.\nWell, people will ask, well,\ncan protein be stored as fat?\nThe carbon's from\nprotein it's unlikely,\nit's going to wind\nup in adipose tissue.\nBut if you're eating\na lot of protein,\noverall as part of a lot of\ncalories, it has to be oxidized\nand it can't provide a calorie\ncushion for other things\nto be stored in fat.\nBut protein itself does provide\na net positive for calories,\nbut less so than\ncarbohydrate or fat.\nAnd tends to be more satiating.\nSo again, when people talk about\nare all calories created equal,\nyes, but all sources\nof calories may\nhave differential effects\non energy expenditure\nand appetite.\nSo that's the TEF bucket\nand the BMR bucket.\nThen we go to physical activity.\nAnd physical activity is,\nessentially, two parts.\nThere's exercise, which is kind\nof your purposeful movements\nlike you go out for a walk,\nyou do a training session.\nI mean, whatever.\nAny purposeful activity.\nAnd then you have\nwhat's called NEAT\nwhich is non-exercise activity\nthermogenesis, which I think\nis actually really cool.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's fascinating.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nIt is.\nSo I was actually hanging\nout with somebody last night\nand I was noticing them,\nthey were fidgeting\ntheir feet and their fingers.\nAnd I said, have you\nalways been pretty lean?\nAnd they were like,\nyeah, I never really\nhad a problem\nmaintaining leanness.\nAnd when you look at the\nobese resistant phenotype,\npeople think they\nhave high BMR or they\nexercise a lot and really\nwhat it seems to be as neat.\nThey tend to-- if they\novereat, they just\nspontaneously increase\ntheir physical activity.\nNow, people get NEAT confused.\nI've heard people say,\nwell, I'm going to go out\nfor a walk to get my NEAT up.\nThat's not NEAT.\nNEAT is not something you\ncan consciously modify.\nWhat you're doing there, if\nit's purposeful, it's exercise.\nSo for example,\nwhen I'm talking,\nif I'm waving around my\nhands, if I'm tapping my feet,\nif I'm--\nwhatever.\nThat's NEAT.\nBut trying to get yourself--\nI'm just going to\ntap my foot more,\nwell, now if I'm\nconsciously having\nto do this, then my focus--\nI mean, you know\nhow the brain works.\nVery hard to do--\nyou don't really do\ntwo things at once.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nLAYNE NORTON: You switch\nquickly between tasks, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely.\nCan I quickly ask, was the\nperson that you were referring\nto our friend Ben Bruno?\nLAYNE NORTON: No, no.\nBut he is fidgety too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nAmazing online fitness channel.\nHe's a freakishly\nstrong individual.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nAnd I can't remember\nwhether or not,\nBen, you're a fidgetter or not.\nBut anyway, I'll\nhave to go check\nand we'll measure\nyour fidgeting.\nAbout non-exercise induced\nthermogenesis NEAT,\nmy understanding of the old\npapers on this, old being,\nI guess, back to\nthe mid '90s, is\nthat the calorie burn from NEAT\nis actually pretty significant.\nWe're not talking about 100\ncalories or 200 calories\nper day.\nWe're talking about,\nin some cases,\nhundreds of thousand-- excuse\nme, hundreds to maybe even\nclose to 1,000 calories per day.\nCould you elaborate on that?\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo there was actually a really\nclassic study, I think, from--\nI want to say it's\nfrom Levine in 1995.\nIt was metabolic ward study.\nAnd hopefully, I don't\nbutcher the study\nbecause I'm trying to\npull it out of my brain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't expect\nyou to have that in your head.\nAlthough, I must say, you have\na quite extensive PubMed ID,\ngrab bag in there.\nSo--\nLAYNE NORTON: I try\nto bring the receipts.\nI try to bring the receipts.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We will put a\nlink to this study in the show\nnote captions.\nSo people can peruse it\nif they like it, yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: So I believe\nthey had people overeat.\nAnd I think it was by\nlike 1,000 calories a day\nand I think for six weeks.\nAnd I mean, this is\nthe metabolic ward.\nSo this is very\ntightly controlled.\nIt's as tight as you get.\nAnd what was interesting\nis, of course, on average,\npeople gained weight\nand gained fat mass.\nBut some people gained\nmore than expected,\nand there was one person, in\nparticular, who only gained\nlike just over 1/2 a kilo.\nThey should have gained like--\nI think it was something\nlike 3 to 4 kilos.\nIt was predicted.\nAnd what they found\nis this individual\njust spontaneously increased\ntheir physical activity.\nHe didn't purposefully\ndo it, it just happened.\nAnd I mean,\nanecdotally, I've seen\npeople who are, again,\nvery lean even eat a meal,\nsit down, and start sweating.\nAnd be very fidgety.\nThere was a natural\nbodybuilder back in the day\nnamed Jim Cordova.\nAnd this guy was just\nvery lean all the time,\nand he was exactly\nthat phenotype.\nHe would walk up\na flight of stairs\nand all of a sudden\nhe's sweating.\nSit down eat a\nmeal, he's sweating.\nHe's just--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's a furnace.\nLAYNE NORTON: Just\nexpending energy.\nAnd what's very\ninteresting about NEAT\nis that seems to be\nthe most modifiable--\nI mean, exercise\nis very modifiable\nbecause you can be\nintentional with that.\nBut of BMR, TEF,\nand NEAT, NEAT seems\nto be far more modifiable.\nSo even a bodyweight\nreduction of 10%,\nthey've observed\na decrease in NEAT\nof almost 500 calories a day for\na 10% reduction in body weight.\nNow, you also do\nget a decline in BMR\nwhen you lose weight,\none, because you're just\nin a smaller body now and\nso it takes less energy\nto lock them out.\nBut also there's what's called\nmetabolic adaptation, which\nis a further reduction\nin your BMR than expected\nfrom the loss of body mass.\nAnd that's on average\nusually around like 15%.\nBut it does seem to be--\nthere's new evidence coming\nout on the metabolic adaptation\nfrom BMR.\nAnd it seems to\nbe a little bit--\nkind of in the\ntransition phases.\nSo if you start a diet\nwithin the first few weeks,\nyou will have a reduction\nin BMR that then just--\nthereafter, any\nfurther reduction\nis mostly from the amount\nof body mass you lose.\nAnd then if you, like for\nexample, finish a diet\nand move your calories\nto maintenance,\nwithin a few weeks, BMR\nstarts to come back up.\nThere is still a\nsmall reduction,\nbut I used to be\nsomebody who thought\nthat BMR, metabolic\nadaptation was\na big reason why people stopped\nlosing weight or plateaued.\nAnd now, I think it's\nmuch more to do with NEAT.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nAnd you said that it\ncan't be conscious\nbecause that will distract\nus from other activities.\nI don't know if you've had a\nchance to look at this study.\nAnd I'll send it to you.\nMaybe I'd be fun to do a kind\nof an online journal club\nabout this at some point soon.\nBut there's a study that came\nout of University of Houston\nrecently having people do, now,\nthis is a long period of time.\nFour hours a day of, basically,\na soleus pushup, which\nis basically a heel raise.\nA seated catchphrase with\none foot not weighted.\nAnd then they\nlooked at it a bunch\nof things about glucose\nmetabolism and glucose\nclearance and insulin levels.\nAnd they didn't\nconclude that people\nburned a ton of\ncalories, but what\nthey concluded was that blood\nsugar regulation improved\ngreatly.\nAnd I think, there was\na lot of excitement\nabout this at some\nlevel, but based\non everything you're telling\nme, this fits perfectly\nwith what's known about neat.\nSo this fell somewhere\nin between with--\nin between, excuse me,\nsort of deliberate exercise\nand spontaneous movement.\nI guess they've tried to make\nthat spontaneous movement\na little bit more conscious.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well,\nwhat I'll tell\npeople is if you're\nworried about NEAT,\none thing you can do,\nlike these watches,\nfor example where people\nare like, oh, well,\ntold me I burned\nthese many calories.\nThey are not accurate\nfor energy expenditure.\nI mean, it is like, there\nwas a meta analysis in 2018,\nI want to say,\nbetween a 28% and 93%\noverestimation of energy\nexpenditure by these watches.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fitness track.\nSo for those of you\nlistening, we're\nnot going to name the brand.\nBut fitness trackers-- so\nwrist-worn fitness trackers.\nLAYNE NORTON: And this\nis across the board.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nLAYNE NORTON: So like\ndepending on the brand,\nit could be more or\nless but, they all\noverestimated the amount of--\nthe calories you\nburn from exercise.\nSo this is actually a great\nexample where people go, well,\ncalories in, calories\nout doesn't work for me,\nbecause I eat in a calorie\ndeficit, I didn't lose weight.\nWhen I talk to\nthem, usually, they\nwent to an online calculator.\nIt's a few things.\nThey went to an\nonline calculator, put\nin their information, it spat\nout some calories to eat,\nand they ate that and\ndidn't lose weight.\nAnd it's like, well, what\ndo you think is more likely?\nThat you're defying the laws\nof conservation of energy\nor that you might\nhave not gotten\nthe right number for you?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nmeasurement tool was off.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nThe next thing is a lot of\npeople weigh very sporadically.\nAnd I'll tell people\nlike, if you're\ngoing to make an intentional\nweight loss a goal,\nand again, this can be\ndifferent for different people,\nbut typically, I\ntell people, weigh\nin, first thing in the\nmorning or after you\ngo to the bathroom,\ndo it every day,\nand take the average\nof that for the week.\nAnd then compare that to\nthe next week's average.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can I ask\none-- sorry to interrupt,\nbut one quick question\nabout that when you say,\ngo to the bathroom not\nto get too detailed here\nunnecessarily, but are you\ntalking about urination\nand emptying your bowels?\nIdeally, because you did eat\na big meal the night before.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nGot it.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So wake up,\nuse the bathroom in all forms\nthat you're ready, and\nthen get on the scale,\ntake that measurement, average\nthat across the week, and then\nmaybe every Monday,\nyou take that value\nand see how it progresses.\nLAYNE NORTON: All right.\nAnd the reason I recommend\ndoing that is, if you're just\nsporadically weighing in, as\nsomebody who weighs themselves\npretty regularly,\nI mean, my weight\nwill fluctuate 5, 6 pounds, and\nnot seemingly changing much.\nAnd that's just-- those\nshort term changes are fluid.\nSo I've had it before,\nwhere week to week,\nmy average didn't change.\nBut between the lowest weigh\nin from a previous week\nand the highest weigh in, might\nhave been like 8 pounds, right?\nSo if you're somebody who\njust randomly is weighing in\nand you're eating in\na calorie deficit,\nand you just weigh in\none day where you've just\nwhatever reason holding some\nmore fluid, then you're oh,\nsee, this isn't working when\nin reality, your average\nmight be dropping.\nSo that's one of the\nreasons, and actually,\nbelieve it or not,\nweight fluctuations\nare actually identified as a\nmajor reason why people get\ndiscouraged from weight loss.\nIt stops the buy-in, when\nthey have a fluctuation up.\nSo that's one of the reasons--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great point.\nLAYNE NORTON: --one\nof the reasons early\non that low carb diets\ntend to work really\nwell is because people\nlose a lot of water weight\nreally quickly, and\nthey get that buy-in.\nSo they're, oh, this is working.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWe can return to\nthat in a little bit\nbecause I have theories\nas to how that--\nwhen people eat\nless carbohydrate,\nthey excrete more\nwater, and they'll see--\nfor the first time, they'll see\nsome definition in their abs,\noh, my God, this diet's amazing.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And the fluid\nloss does hold that promise.\nI think fluid loss can\ndo some other things.\nIt might make people\nliterally feel lighter,\nalthough it can be-- it\nhas some negative effects.\nI do have one quick\nquestion, and I\ndo want-- we will return\nto NEAT in a moment.\nBut when you say,\nthe caloric burn\nas a consequence\nof exercise, I want\nto ask about the caloric\nburn during that exercise?\nSo for instance, if\nsomebody is on the treadmill\nand they'll see, OK,\nthey burn 400 calories.\nActually, I think\nthis is a month\nwhere a number of\nprominent podcasters\nlike Bert Kreischer, Tom\nSegura, Joe Rogan, and others,\nI think they call\nit \"Sober October,\"\nbut in addition to\navoiding alcohol,\nthey're burning 500 calories\nper day during the exercise.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey're measuring it.\nA lot of people do this.\nThey think-- they take\ntrack of weather--\nexcuse me, take stock of how\nmany calories they burned.\nMy understanding is that if\nthat particular form of exercise\nis a muscle building\nform of exercise,\nthat at some point later, there\nmight be an increase in muscle\nif you did everything\nright, do everything right,\nand then you will\nburn more energy\nas a consequence of\nadding that tissue.\nThat's a long process\nas and we will discuss.\nBut I have heard about this\npost-exercise induced increase\nin oxidative metabolism.\nI'm probably not using the\nright language in here.\nSo if I were to go out, for\ninstance, and do some sprints.\nRun hard for a minute, jog for\na minute, run hard for a minute,\nand do that 10 times over.\nLet's assume I burn 400 calories\nduring that exercise bout.\nBut my understanding is that\nin the hours that follow,\nmy basal metabolic rate\nwill have increased.\nIs that true, and is\nit significant enough\nto care about?\nLAYNE NORTON: So answer\nboth of those questions.\nYes, there does seem\nto be a small increase\nin metabolic rate,\nand no, it does not\nappear to be enough to\nactually make a difference.\nSo when they look at--\nand again, this is\nwhere I tell people--\nI think I have a good\nperspective on this,\nbecause my undergraduate degree\nwas a biochemistry degree.\nSo I was very into mechanisms.\nYou know what I mean?\nIt was like, oh, if we just do\nthis and this, we'll get this.\nAnd then I did nutrition\nas a graduate degree,\nand then my advisor was so great\nbecause you could do something\nover here and he could tell\nyou how it would affect\nvitamin D metabolism over here.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis is Don Lemon?\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah, Don Lemon.\nSo he would always\nkind of say, yeah,\nbut what's the outcome\ngoing to be, right?\nSo this is actually one of the\nthings I changed my mind on.\nWas I used to be\nvery much, well,\nI think high intensity interval\ntraining is probably better\nbecause you get this\npost-exercise energy burn\nwhich they do see in\nsome of these studies.\nBut in the meta analyzes and\nmore tightly controlled studies\nwhere they equate work between\nhigh intensity intervals\nand moderate or low intensity\ncardio, so equating work,\nthey don't see differences\nin the loss of body fat.\nAnd so to me, if I'm\nlooking like, that's\nthe example of a\nmechanism, which is OK,\nwe're seeing this small increase\nin basal metabolic rate,\nthat should lead to\nincreased loss of body fat.\nBut again, remember, you're\ncapturing a snapshot in time.\nBut we don't see a difference\nin the loss of body fat.\nSo what may be happening-- and\nagain, I'm just speculating.\nBut a way to explain it could\nbe, you might have an increase\nand then you might actually\nhave a decrease that tends\nto just wash it out, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.\nAnd I have to imagine\nsome forms of exercise.\nThis would be highly individual,\nbut will spike appetite more\nthan others.\nSo for instance, if I go out\nfor a 45-minute jog which I do.\nA 45 to 60-minute hike or\njog once a week, I just\nmake it a point to do that or\nruck or something like that.\nThrow on a weight vest and hike.\nAfter that, I find I'm very\nthirsty, I want to hydrate.\nBut I'm not that hungry.\nAnd that's true of all\ncardiovascular exercise for me.\nBut after I weight train,\nabout 60 to 90 minutes later,\nI want to eat the refrigerator.\nAnd so obviously,\ncalories in, calories out\ndictates that that will\nplay an important role as to\nwhether or not I gain or\nlose weight, et cetera.\nSo is it safe to say that\nthe specific form of exercise\nthat people choose needs to\nbe taken in consideration?\nCalories in, calories\nout, so how much\nis burned during the exercise?\nAlso how much that exercise\ntends to stimulate appetite.\nI don't know whether\nor not people explore\nthis in their rigorous studies.\nAnd whether or not\nthat form of exercise\nactually increases lean\nmuscle mass or not.\nNow, we've taken\nexercise and split it\ninto a number of\ndifferent dimensions,\nbut this is what you are\nso masterful at is really\nparsing how the different\ncomponents work individually\nand together.\nSo if you would\njust expand on that,\nI'd love to know\nwhat you're thinking.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo this is actually a\nreally fascinating thing.\nSo first thing, I\nwant to just go back\nto talking about like, for\nexample, Bert and Tom and Joe,\nwe're going to do 500\ncalories a day on whatever.\nSo those apparatuses\ndon't measure those things\neffectively either.\nJust like these watches.\nBut the one thing I will\nsay is, if you are--\nlike for example, if I do two\nhours of resistance training,\ntypically, this will say I\nburned about 1,000 calories.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a\nlot of resistance training.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMy weight workouts\nare warm up for 10 minutes and\nthen one hour of work done.\nLAYNE NORTON: I just--\nI love to train.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nAnd you can recover from.\nMy recovery quotient\nis pretty low.\nSo I've been training\nfor 30 plus years,\nand I found that if I\ndo more than an hour\nof hard work in the gym,\nmeaning resistance training,\n75 minutes maybe, I'm OK, but\npast that, I have to take two,\nmaybe even three days\noff before I can train.\nMy nervous system just\ndoesn't tolerate it well.\nSo I limit it to\nan hour, you know.\nLAYNE NORTON: And part of\nthat to remember is like,\nI've built up to that over\na long period of time.\nSo you couldn't just throw\nsomebody in and start\nhaving them do two hours a day.\nIt's not going to\ngo well for them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break,\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake athletic Greens, once\nor usually twice a day, is\nthat it gets me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very\nimportant, it's populated\nby gut microbiota\nthat communicate\nwith the brain, the immune\nsystem, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational or nutritional\nneeds are met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com.huberman,\nand they'll give\nyou five free travel\npacks that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while you're\non the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year's supply\nof vitamin D3, K2.\nLAYNE NORTON: But I will say\nabout the calorie trackers, so\nif I'm used to--\nOK, I usually burn about 1,000\ncalories according to this,\nit's not accurate.\nBut if I go in tomorrow and I do\n1,300, it may not be accurate--\nI don't know what\nthe exact number is,\nbut I can be relatively\nconfident that it's\nmore than the previous session.\nAnd so in terms\nof comparison, it\nmight be OK, like\nwithin subject.\nAnd then the other thing I\nwas kind of circling around on\nwas, if you're worried about\nNEAT, tracking your steps\ncan be helpful because people\nstep counts can spontaneously\ndecrease when they're\non a fat loss diet,\nthey don't even realize it.\nAnd that, again, not\na complete measure\nof NEAT, but what we've had\nsome clients do with our team\nbuilding coaches is, they'll\nsay OK, you're, at 8,000 steps\nright now.\nWe're not going to add\nany purposeful cardio.\nBut whatever you need to do\nto maintain that 8,000 steps,\ndo that.\nAnd sometimes, they have to add\n15, 20, 30 minutes of cardio,\nbecause they're spontaneous\nactivity that they're not\neven aware of goes down.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\na really excellent point.\nI've heard the 10,000\nsteps per day number was,\nwe all heard that.\nAnd then I learned that, 10,000\nwere just kind of thrown out\nas an arbitrary number.\nSo we're like get eight-hour\nintermittent fasting thing,\nthere's a story behind\nthat because actually I\nspoke to Satchin,\nand it turns out\nthat the graduate\nstudent in his lab\ndid that initial study, which\nwas on mice, by the way,\nwas limited to being in\nlab for about eight hours\nby their significant other.\nSo the eight-hour feeding window\nis actually the consequence\nof this person's relationship.\nSo--\nLAYNE NORTON: That is\na really great point\nthat people don't realize\nwhen they-- a lot of people\nwill try to copy like\nscientific studies.\nAnd I'll tell people like,\nlisten, scientific studies are\nso confined.\nYou need to be very careful\nwith how broadly you\napply what's in there.\nLike they're a very big hammer\nis the way I look at it.\nThey're not a scalpel,\nthey're a big hammer.\nAnd I think, a lot of\ntimes in terms of coaching,\nscientific studies will\ntell you what not to do\nrather than what to do, right?\nBut getting back\nto your question\nabout exercise,\nappetite, so first off,\nI'm not really aware if\nthere's evidence showing\nlike differential effects of\ndifferent forms of exercise\non appetite, it's possible,\nbut again, it also\ncould be like a\nplacebo effect, right?\nBecause we-- like for example,\nyou and I, grew up in an era\nwhere the muscle\nmagazines, it was like,\nwell, as soon as you\nfinish your workout,\nyou have your biggest\nmeal of the day.\nAnd when I say placebo\neffect, I think\npeople have the wrong idea of\nwhat the placebo effect is.\nThey think that's\njust a feeling.\nPlacebo effect can actually\nchange your physiology.\nPeople don't realize this.\nThere's research showing\nthat a placebo or the power\nof suggestion is\nbasically as powerful\nas some pharmaceuticals.\nAnd one of the great examples\nI like to use is-- actually,\nthere was a study we just\ncovered in our research review\non creatine where\nthey did four groups--\nnot supplemented with creatine,\ntold they weren't supplemented\nwith creatine, not\nsupplemented, told\nthey were supplemented,\nsupplemented,\ntold they weren't,\nsupplemented, until they were.\nBasically, it just matters\nwhat they told them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Really.\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis is incredible.\nI have to get this\nstudy well so we\ncan link to a colleague\nof mine at Stanford.\nShe's been on the podcast.\nI'd love to introduce\nyou to because I\nthink you guys really riff.\nFirst of all, she was\na former D1 athlete\nand then as runs a lab at\nStanford in psychology.\nThis is Alia Crum.\nAnd she's-- and grew up in\nthis very athletic, obviously,\nand very, very smart.\nAnd her laboratory focuses on\nthese belief/placebo effects\nwhere if you tell people all\nthe horrible things that stress\ndo to you in terms of\nyour memory and cognitive\nfunctioning and then you\ngive them a memory test,\nthey perform well\nbelow baseline.\nIf you tell them that\nstress sharpens them\nin the short term,\nand that adrenaline\nis this powerful\nmolecule that can really\ntune up a number of memory\nsystems, memory improves.\nAnd it's remarkable.\nAnd it's consistent.\nAnd they've done this for any\nnumber of different things,\nincluding food\nallergies, for instance.\nIncredible results.\nIn any case, I'm so glad\nyou're bringing this up.\nI take creatine monohydrate,\nand I have for years.\n5 grams a day.\nI don't--\nLAYNE NORTON: And it's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's great.\nAnd I believe it's great.\nSo is there a compound effect\nof believing it's great\nand it actually being great?\nLAYNE NORTON: Not in this study.\nSo I think the\nthing to point out,\npeople will misinterpret that\nas creatine doesn't work.\nAnd that's not what that says.\nWhat it says is, your\nbeliefs about what it does\nare probably just as\npowerful as what it does.\nSo they actually did a study--\nand I don't have the\ncitation, but it was--\nI think, within\nthe last 10 years\nwhere they told people\nthey were putting them\non anabolic steroids.\nAnd wouldn't you know it,\nthey had better gains--\neven though they weren't\nactually on anabolic steroids,\nthey had better gains than\npeople that they didn't tell\nwere anabolic steroids.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.\nLAYNE NORTON: And that's\nlike hard outcomes.\nStrength, lean body mass,\nthose sorts of things.\nSo when people say,\nwell, I wouldn't\nfall for the placebo\neffect, it's like,\nyou don't have to fall for it.\nIf you believe it to be\ntrue, the power of belief\nis very, very powerful.\nAnd as a scientist, I wish,\nsometimes, I was ignorant\nso that I could subject\nmyself to the placebo effect\nmore often.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, absolutely.\nLAYNE NORTON: So\ngetting back to,\nthat's just a possible\nexplanation of, maybe, why.\nAnd I'm the same way, like\nI get done with a workout,\nlike a resistance training\nsession, I'm like,\nI'm ready to eat.\nNow, if you look\nat the literature\noverall on exercise\nand appetite,\nit's not always\nwhat you'd expect.\nConsistently, it seems to show\nthat exercise actually has\nan appetite suppressant effect.\nSo people don't\ntend to compensate\nat least fully for the\namount of movement they do.\nAnd there is some\nevidence that--\nyou've probably heard\npeople say, well, exercise\na really poor weight loss tool.\nIf you figure out\nhow many calories\nyou should be burning\nfrom it and you do that,\nyou end up getting less weight\nloss that you would predict.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I have\na family member who\nis perfectly happy to eat less,\nbut doesn't loathe exercise,\nbut dislikes exercise.\nAnd they're of healthy weight.\nBut I'm always encouraging\nthem to exercise more.\nAnd so this is an ongoing battle\nin our sibling relationship.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well,\none thing I would say\nis that, exercise\nindependent of anything\nthat happens with your body\nweight, you will be healthier.\nSo exercise is one of the\nonly things that will actually\nimprove your\nbiomarkers of health\nwithout even losing weight.\nSo those-- it will improve\nyour insulin sensitivity,\ninflammation, all that stuff.\nSo everybody out there looking\nfor a hack to be healthier\nexercises the hack, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nCrucial point.\nAnd our mutual friend\nDr. Peter Attia, I think,\nhas gone on record\nseveral times now saying\nthat of all the things\nthat one could take--\nNMN, et cetera, metformin.\nRegardless of whether or not\none takes those or doesn't take\nthose, that the positive\neffects on longevity\nby way of biomarkers from\nregular exercise is--\nfar outweighs all of\nthose things combined.\nNot that those things\ndon't necessarily work,\nwe're not going through\nthem in detail now,\nbut that exercise\nis by far the best\nthing we can do for our\nhealth span and lifespan.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\nI 100% agree.\nAnd when you're talking\nabout weight loss,\npeople miss the point\nof exercise, I think.\nThere's some work that came\nout from Herman Pontzer\nas well that basically\nshowed like, well,\nif you do 100 calories\nfrom exercise,\nyou have a 28-calorie reduction\nin your basal metabolic rate\nin response to that.\nSo it's kind of like this\nconstrained energy expenditure\nmodel.\nBut what I would say is, OK,\nwell there's still a net of 72.\nSo it's still OK,\nand the other thing\nis, I think the effects\nof exercise on weight loss\nare actually more due to\nwhat it does to appetite.\nSo if you look at people who\nlose weight and keep it off\nfor a number of years,\nkind of outliers\nbecause most people don't keep\nit off for years, over 70%\nof them engage in\nregular exercise.\nOf people who do not\nkeep weight loss,\nlike maintain weight loss, less\nthan 30% exercise regularly.\nSo now that's just\na correlation.\nThat doesn't necessarily\nprove causation.\nBut there are some\npretty compelling studies\nshowing that exercise\nincreases your sensitivity\nto satiety signals.\nSo basically, you can have\nthe same satiety signals,\nbut you're more sensitive\nto them when you exercise.\nAnd there's actually\na really classic study\nfrom the 1950s in\nBengali workers\nwhere they looked at, basically,\nfour different quadrants\nof activity.\nSo you had sedentary, lightly\nactive, moderately active,\nheavily active.\nBasically, based on\ntheir job choice.\nAnd they didn't have\nan intervention.\nThey just wanted to track\nthem and see how many calories\ndid they actually eat.\nSo it was like a J-shaped curve.\nSo the sedentary\nactually ate more food\nthan the lightly active\nor moderately active.\nBut from lightly active\nto heavily active,\nthey almost perfectly\ncompensated how many calories\nthey should be eating.\nSo to me, that suggests,\nwhen you become active,\nyou can actually regulate your\nappetite appropriately or much\nmore appropriately than\nif you're sedentary.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd do you think\nthis has to do with\nchanges in the brain--\nbrain centers that\nrespond to satiety signals\nfrom the periphery,\nand/or do you\nthink it has to do with changes\nin blood sugar regulation?\nWhat I was taught, and I\ndon't know if this is still\nconsidered true, is that\nspikes in blood sugar\nwill trigger a desire to\neat more even though it's\nkind of exactly the opposite\nof what you need when you\nhave a spike in blood sugar.\nAnd there's this\nkind of-- and we'll\nget into this when we talk\nabout artificial sweeteners.\nThis is the idea in mind.\nI think I adopted, perhaps,\nfalsely that you eat something\nthat's sweeter, that\ntastes really good,\nand you are suddenly on the\ntrain of wanting to eat more.\nAnd I could imagine\nhow exercise,\nif it is increasing\nthe satiety signals,\ncould be working a\nnumber of different ways.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nI think it's--\nI think the effect is probably\nmostly at the brain level.\nThe effects on blood sugar--\nthe research out there is not\nvery compelling for blood sugar\ndriving appetite.\nNow, if you become hypoglycemic,\nyes, you'll get hungry,\nbut it's a different kind of\nhunger than your normal like,\nI feel kind of empty and\nmy stomach's growling.\nLike those are--\nthey can go together,\nbut usually like the\nhypoglycemia is like, I am hot,\nI feel like I'm\ngoing to pass out.\nYou want to eat something not\nbecause your stomach's growling\nbut because that you\njust need some fuel.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like\nyou're getting pulled under.\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.\nAbsolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI've been there when\nI've done the longer\nfasts, something\nI don't do anymore and\ndrink a lot of black coffee.\nThere was probably an\nelectrolyte effect there\nbecause coffee as you excrete\nsodium and other electrolytes.\nAnd then just feeling\nlike, I needed something.\nThis whole thing\nlike I need something\nthat's kind of desperation.\nI never want to be\nback here again.\nHypoglycemia is\nvery uncomfortable.\nLAYNE NORTON: It's not fun.\nSo again, then when they look\nat actual randomized controlled\ntrials of implementing\nsome exercise where\nthey're pretty\ncontrolled environment,\nthey typically see people--\nif anything, they eat less\nas opposed to eating more.\nNow, some people, again,\nstudies report averages.\nAnd there's individual\ndata points.\nSo there are some people who\nat least anecdotally report\nthat exercise makes\nthem more hungry.\nThat's completely valid.\nIt could be their\nbeliefs around it,\nit could be a number\nof different things,\nbut it's important to\nunderstand that there\nis individual variability.\nAnd I think one of\nthe things that I've\nlearned to appreciate\nmore is not\ntrying to separate\npsychology and physiology.\nWe do this a lot and say, well,\nI want to know the physiology,\nI don't care about\nthe psychology of it.\nAnd now I'm kind of appreciating\nmore, psychology is physiology.\nLike with most things\nnow, we have kind\nof the biopsychosocial model.\nAnd I'll give you\nan example of this.\nA lot of people get really\ncaught up with appetite.\nAnd if we could just\nsuppress people's appetite,\nthat's part of it.\nBut people don't just eat\nbecause they're hungry,\nthey eat for a lot of different\nreasons, social reasons,\nespecially.\nSo can you remember the\nlast social event you ever\nwent to that didn't have food?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nIf you look at dinner\nplates from the 1800s,\nthey're about this big.\nNow how big are dinner plates?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe whole buffet.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: There's\nsituational cues.\nYou're sitting down to watch TV.\nOh, grab some popcorn,\ngrab some snack, whatever.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\neven see this with--\nyou know, how one person\nwill pick up the phone\nand then everyone\npicks up their phone.\nI think there's a\nsimilar effect with food.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nAnd same thing, right?\nLike how many times have\nwe either done it ourselves\nor have been experienced\npeople saying, oh, you\nshould have something--\nyou should have alcohol,\nespecially, right?\nPeople-- I was hanging out\nwith somebody last night\nand I had a beer and\nthey just had a water.\nAnd I'm like, I feel no need\nto try and convince them\nto do that with me.\nYou know what I mean?\nBut as humans,\nwe're hurt animals.\nWe don't want to be\ndoing something out\nin isolation on our own.\nNow, this is a very tenuous,\nI guess, belief of mine.\nBut doing things\nalone in isolation\nduring ancestral\ntimes, that's going\nto set off your alarm system.\nBecause if you don't\nhave other people,\nyou can't protect yourself.\nSo typically, things were\ndone together in groups.\nAnd I think that's a\nlot of the reason why\nwe tend to be just tribal in\nnature about a lot of things.\nSo the whole point to that\nis, on the list of reasons\nwhy people eat, I\nmean, I've gotten\nto the point where I think that\nhunger is actually not even\nthe main reason people eat.\nStress, lack of sleep--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Boredom.\nLAYNE NORTON: --boredom.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: Absolutely.\nSo unless we can\ndo something that\naddresses all those\nthings, there's\na line from a review paper--\nthis review paper\ncame out in 2011\nis by a researcher\nnamed MacLean.\nAnd it's the best review\npaper I've ever read.\nIt was called, biology's\nresponse to dieting--\nthe impetus for weight regain.\nAnd basically went\nthrough all the mechanisms\nof these adaptations that\nhappen during fat loss diets\nand how biology's response\nis to try to drive you back\nto your previous.\nAnd I'm going to\nbutcher the quote,\nbut at the end of the\nstudy he said, basically,\nthe body's systems are\ncomprehensive, redundant,\nand well-focused on restoring\ndepleted energy reserves.\nAnd any attempt or any\nstrategy for weight loss\nthat doesn't attempt to\naddress a broad spectrum\nof these things\nis going to fail.\nAnd so that's why when people\nsay, well, just do low carb,\nyou won't be hungry.\nLook, people don't just\neat because they're hungry.\nSo I think really like\ntrying to get outside the box\nand think about these things.\nAnd especially, when you\nread some of the literature,\nI recently read a systematic\nreview of successful weight\nloss maintainers, which I\nthought was really interesting.\nSo they took people who had lost\na significant amount of body\nweight and kept it off for,\nI think, it was three years.\nAnd it basically asked\nthem questions and tried\nto identify commonalities.\nAnd there were\nsome things that I\nexpected like cognitive\nrestraint, self monitoring,\nexercise.\nAnd then one of the\nthings they said\nthat I found really fascinating\nwas pretty ubiquitous\nbetween people.\nThey said, I had to\ndevelop a new identity.\nSo are you familiar\nwith Ethan Suplee?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nLAYNE NORTON: So\nEthan is an actor.\nHe's been in like remember the\nTitans and American History X.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I certainly\nsaw American History X.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo he was very large.\nHe was like 550 pounds.\nAnd now he's like\n230 and jacked.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\n5-- he was how many--\nLAYNE NORTON: 550 pounds.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nLAYNE NORTON: And he\nhas-- whenever he puts up\npost on his Instagram of\nhim training, it'll say,\nI killed my clone today.\nAnd I asked him, is this\nwhat you're talking about?\nCreating a new identity.\nAnd he said, this is exactly\nwhat I'm talking about.\nBecause I had to kill who I was.\nBecause there was\nno way I was going\nto be able to make long\nterm changes if I just\ndidn't become a new person.\nBecause I mean, and\naddicts talk about this.\nLike people who are alcoholics.\nThey had to get new friends.\nThey had to hang out\nat different places,\nbecause their entire\nlife had been set up\naround this lifestyle\nfor alcohol.\nAnd I would actually argue\nthat eating disorders\nor disordered eating patterns\nis much harder to break\nthan other forms of addiction.\nAnd you think about\nfood addiction.\nWell, in some ways, bulimia and\nanorexia are still addictions.\nYou can't stop eating.\nLike if you're alcoholic,\nyou can abstain from alcohol.\nIf you become addicted\nto say, cocaine,\nyou can abstain from that.\nYou can never abstain from food.\nAnd so now imagine\ntelling a gambling addict,\nwell, you've got to play this\nslot a couple of times a day\nbut no more.\nLike that's really challenging.\nSo yeah.\nI just-- like all\nthis stuff, it's\nso important to be comprehensive\nwith how we treat these things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nThese are incredibly\nimportant points.\nAnd to my knowledge,\nI don't think\nanyone has really described\nit in a cohesive way the way\nthat you're doing here.\nSo important for people\nto understand this\nbecause obviously,\nas a neuroscientist,\nI think the nervous system\nis creating our thoughts,\nour thoughts and feelings\nare related to psychology,\nand therefore, of course, our\nphysiology and our psychology\nare one and the same.\nIt's bidirectional.\nNow, nowadays, there's a lot\nof interest in brain, body,\nand particular gut--\nbrain axis and we\ncan talk about that.\nBut I really\nappreciate that you're\nspelling out how there are\nthese different variables.\nEach one can account for a\nnumber of different things.\nExercise clearly has a\nremarkably potent effect--\nboth during the exercise\nin terms of caloric burn\nand overall health\nand biomarkers.\nAnd then this is\nwonderful to learn\nthat it can increase the\nsensitivity to satiety signals.\nI think that makes--\nat least in my mind,\nplaces very high on the\nlist of things that people\nshould absolutely do.\nBut there are other factors too.\nAnd the identity\npiece is fascinating.\nIt reminds me also-- your\nstory reminds me also of David\nGoggins who is--\nhe talks about his former\nvery overweight self\nalmost as if it was\na different person.\nAnd he uses language that\nI'm not going to use here.\nBut you know what?\nI've met David, know David\na bit, and his every bit\nis intense and driven as\nand a remarkable human\nbeing as he appears\nto be online.\nHe is that guy.\nBut it does seem like he\nhad to more or less kill off\na former version of himself and\ncontinues to do that every day.\nAnd I think what your point\nabout this other fellow who\ndoes it through a similar\nprocess, the word \"today\"\nseems to really matter.\nIt's not like you defeat this\nformer version of yourself\nand then that person\nis buried and gone,\nyou said, you know, I\nkilled my clone today,\nand that's the way that\nDavid talks about it also.\nSo this is a daily process.\nAnd I think this is not just a\nsmall detail in time together\nall these things.\nI think that what\nyou are describing\nis fundamental,\nbecause we can pull\non each one of these\nvariables and talk\nabout each one of them.\nBut at the end of the day,\nwe are a cohesive whole\nas an individual.\nSorry.\nYou were about to say.\nLAYNE NORTON: That gets actually\ninto one of my favorite topics,\nwhich is, why do we have such\na hard time with losing weight\nbut more so keeping it off?\nBecause of obese people, six\nout of every seven obese people\nwill lose a significant amount\nof body weight in their life.\nSo why do we still have\nan obesity problem?\nThey don't keep it off.\nWhy don't they keep it off?\nWhen you look at the\nresearch, basically,\nwhat it suggests is\nbecause people think about,\nI am going to do a diet, and\nI'm going to lose this weight,\nand they do not give any thought\nto what happens afterwards.\nIt's like think about if you\nhave some chronic disease\nor a diabetic.\nYou can't just take insulin\nonce and that's it, right?\nYou've got to take it\ncontinuously, otherwise,\nyou're going to have problems.\nIf you do a diet and you\nlose 30 pounds, fantastic.\nBut if you then just go\nback to all your old habits,\nyou're going to go back to\nwhere you were, if not more.\nYou can't create a new\nversion of yourself\nwhile dragging your old habits\nand behaviors behind you.\nSo what I'll tell people is--\nbecause people say, well,\nI'm doing a carnivore diet\nor I'm doing this\ndiet or that diet.\nAnd I'll say that's fine.\nDo you see yourself doing that\nfor the rest of your life?\nAnd if the answer is\nyes, if you really\nbelieve that that's going\nto be sustainable for you,\nand plenty of people, low carb,\nintermittent fasting, whatever,\nthey say, I felt easy.\nI could do this forever.\nGreat.\nIf you're going to lose weight,\nyou have to invoke some form\nof restriction-- whether it is\na nutrient restriction like low\ncarb, low fat, a\ntime restriction--\nintermittent fasting any form\nof time restricted eating,\nor calorie restriction--\ntracking macros, whatever.\nSo you get to pick the\nform of restriction.\nSo pick the form\nof restriction that\nfeels the least restrictive\nto you as an individual,\nand also do not\nassume that it will\nfeel the same for everybody else\nbecause I made this mistake.\nWhereas it's like,\nI track things.\nAnd so I allow myself to\neat a variety of foods,\nI allow myself to\neat some fun foods.\nBut I track everything, and\nI'm able to modify my body\ncomposition and be in\ngood health doing that.\nNow, doesn't feel hard for me.\nPart of it, I've just\nbeen doing it for so long.\nBut to other people,\nthat's very stressful.\nThey don't want to--\nthey say, well, I'd rather\njust not eat for 16 hours.\nIf that feels easy for them,\ndo that because the one thing\nthat-- there was a couple of\nmeta analysis on popular diets.\nAnd basically, what\nthey showed was\nthey were all equally terrible\nfor long term weight loss.\nBut when they stratified them\nby adherence-- and none of them\nwere better for\nadherence overall.\nBut when they\nstratified people just\naccording from lowest\nadherence to best adherence,\nthere it was a linear\neffect on weight loss.\nSo really what it\nsays is, what is\nthe diet that's going to be\neasiest for you to adhere to\nin the long term and you\nshould probably do that?\nAnd people-- again, this is\nwhere I step back and take\nthe 10,000-foot view.\nSomebody will say,\nwell, I'm going\nto do ketogenic because I want\nto increase my fat oxidation\nand I want to do this.\nAnd they're talking about\nall these mechanisms\nand everything.\nAnd that's great.\nCan you do it for the\nrest of your life?\nIs this going to be something\nsustainable for you?\nAnd if the answer\nis, no, you probably\nneed to rethink what your\napproach is going to be.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Incredibly\nimportant message.\nBasically, that.\nIf I could highlight-- if there\nwas a version of highlight\nor boldface and underline\nin the podcast space,\nI would highlight-- boldface and\nunderline what you just said.\nAnd for those of\nyou that heard it,\nlisten to it twice,\nand then go forward\nbecause it's absolutely key.\nI think it also explains a lot\nof the so-called controversy\nthat exists out there.\nI think it also crosses over\nwith the placebo effect.\nI almost want to say,\npick the nutrition plan\nthat you think you can stick\nto for a long period of time,\nideally forever.\nAnd pick your placebo\ntoo, because there\nis a lot of placebo\nwoven into each\nand every one of these things--\nintermittent fasting, keto.\nProbably even vegan versus\nomnivore versus carnivore.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well, they even\ntalk about the diet-- honeymoon\nperiod where you go into a\ndiet and you're all fired up\nabout it and like\nyou're very adherent,\nand then what happens,\nwith every single diet\nwithout exception\nin research studies\nis once you get past few\nmonths, adherence just\nstarts waiting and going off.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Here\nwe are really talking\nabout a form of relationship.\nI'm not saying that\nto be tongue in cheek.\nActually, we had a guest early\non in the podcast, Dr. Karl\nDeisseroth, he's a psychiatrist\nand a bioengineer at Stanford.\nTremendously successful.\nAlaska award winner, et cetera.\nAnd he talked about love as a\nsort of an interesting aspect\nof our psychology\nwhere it's a story\nthat you co-create with\nsomebody but that you live\ninto the future of that story.\nWhen you pair up\nwith somebody that\nwas referring to romantic\nlove, that there's\nthis sort of mutual agreement\nto create this idea that you're\ngoing to live into.\nSo it's not just about how\nyou feel in the moment,\nit's also that you project\ninto the future quite a lot.\nI'm seeing a lot of\nparallels with a highly\nfunctional and effective diet.\nAnd I love it.\nI'm not setting this\nparallel up artificially,\nI'm setting up because I\nthink that ultimately it\nboils down to what you\nsaid earlier, which\nis that the brain and our\ndecisions about what we\nare going to stick to are\ntremendously powerful.\nLAYNE NORTON: I think one thing\nI will say is keep in mind,\nwhen you look at the research\ndata, the meta analyzes on say,\ntime-restricted eating versus\nnone, when calories are\nequated, doesn't seem to\nbe a difference in weight\nloss, fat loss, and most\nbiomarkers of health.\nSame thing for low\ncarb versus low fat.\nFewer quick calories\nand protein.\nThere was a meta analysis done\nby Kevin Hall back in 2017\nwhere they looked at the-- and\nagain, actual loss of body fat.\nAnd another important\npoint was, I think\nthere was 22 studies in this.\nBut all of them provided\nfood to the participants\nThat's important because\nthat ensures that adherence\ncan be much higher\nin those studies\nwhereas various free\nliving studies, sometimes,\nyou can see funky results.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: People\nare sneaking food\nor they're just not really--\nLAYNE NORTON: It's\nvery difficult--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--eating the way\nthat the study would\nideally have them eat.\nLAYNE NORTON:\nUnless the person is\ngetting like continuous\nsupport-- like,\nstudies where they\nhave a dietician talk\nto people like every\nweek tend to actually\nhave pretty good adherence.\nI mean, that's expensive\nto have done the study.\nAnd again, like what limits\nstudies, money, money,\nand money.\nBut the low carb versus low\nfat, protein, and calories\nare equated, basically,\nno difference in fat loss.\nNow, some people get\nupset about this.\nBut it's like--\nwhat to me, that's\nlike-- this is great because you\nget to pick the tool you want.\nThe one tool, it\ndoesn't seem to be\nthat much better than another.\nSo pick the one\nthat works for you.\nWhatever lever\nyou've got a pull,\nyou've got a bunch\nof different options.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nmentioned picking something\nthat you can stick to\nfor a period of time.\nIs there ever a case\nfor someone saying,\nlook, I like to eat low carb\nor even keto for six months\nand then switch to a\nmore standard omnivore\ncaloric maintenance type\ndiet and then switch back?\nIs there any downside\nto doing that\nfor sake of health or\nweight loss over time,\nor weight maintenance over time?\nBecause I realize not everyone\nis trying to lose weight.\nAnd I definitely\nwant to talk about,\nat some point, how to\neat to maintain weight.\nBecause I think there are\na significant fraction\nof people out there who\nare trying to do that.\nYeah.\nIs there any downside\nto being a dabbler?\nKeto for a few months\nand then omnivore\nfor a few months, et cetera?\nLAYNE NORTON: I think that's\nactually a great thing,\nespecially to like,\nmaybe, find what\nyou feel is easiest for you.\nBut in terms of as a\nstrategy, I mean, I guess,\nsome people just might\nget into dopamine\nbut like, oh, change\nand get something new.\nAnd you feel a little bit\nmore positive about it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\ndo partner model.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nSo I don't think it's how I\nwould usually set things up\ninitially for somebody,\nbut if somebody said, hey,\nI just like to have some\nvariety and change it up,\nas long as they're still like--\ntheir behaviors and they're\ndoing portion control\nor whatever it is, and\nthey're able to sustain\na calorie deficit or depending\non whatever their goal is,\nI don't think there's\nreally any downside to it.\nI do think the one thing\nto keep in mind is,\nwhen you look at like\ngoing between extremes,\nso like low fat to low\ncarb or vise versa,\nthere can be, in that\ntransition, period a little bit\nof weirdness for lack\nof a better term.\nLike for example, if you've\nbeen on a ketogenic diet and all\nof a sudden, you move\nto a higher carb diet,\nyou'll be basically\ninsulin resistant\nfor just a short period of time.\nNow, is that going to\ncause any health problems?\nProbably not in the long term,\nespecially, if you're still\ncontrolling calories.\nBut just because your body has\nlike upregulated these systems,\ndealing mostly with fat\nand glucose production\nrather than glucose\nmetabolism, so now\nif you start taking glucose\nor carbohydrate back in,\nlike for example, you get\nsomebody-- or a glucose\ntolerance test after\nthey've been on keto,\nthey'll do pretty\nterribly at it.\nBut that doesn't last that long.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: About how long?\nLAYNE NORTON: A few weeks.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that's\nimportant for people to know,\nbecause I have a feeling\nduring those first few weeks\nare the period of time\nwhen a lot of people\ngo running back to what\nthey were doing previously.\nWhich is not to say that they\nshouldn't, but I've certainly\ndone that.\nI've tried very low\ncarbohydrate diet,\nand I would have assumed--\nand now I know I'm\ncompletely wrong,\nbut I assumed that I was\nso carbohydrate starved\nfor so long that my\ninsulin sensitivity, which\nis a good thing,\nby the way folks,\nwould have gone\nthrough the roof,\nand I would be able to just\nsponge up every bit of glucose\nthat I would have ingested\nthrough carbohydrate.\nSo I did indeed switch over.\nAnd I felt like I had\npretty terrible brain fog.\nI even got some jitters.\nAnd I thought, what is this?\nMy blood sugar was low\nbefore, and now my blood sugar\nshould be in more\nmoderate territory.\nBut based on what\nyou just said, I'd\nupregulated the\nenzymes and systems\nin the body for fat\nmetabolism on the keto diet\nand then switching over--\nthere was basically a ramping up\nof the molecules involved in--\npresumably in glycolysis.\nLAYNE NORTON: Transition period.\nI mean, think about if you\nhaven't weight trained before\nand you start weight\ntraining, you're\ngoing to feel pretty terrible.\nLike you're going\nto be sore and stiff\nand all that kind of stuff.\nBut I will say, you aren't\nnecessarily wrong in what\nyou said about being\nmore insulin sensitive,\nbecause it depends on how you\nmeasure insulin sensitivity.\nSo if you measure with something\nlike fasting blood glucose\nor fasting insulin\nor even HOMA-IR,\nthose tend to be pretty\ngood on low carb.\nBut then if you do it all\nglucose tolerance test,\nit tends to be pretty bad.\nAnd so it depends on\nyour specific measure.\nSo I think that\nthe idea that keto\nmakes you glucose intolerant\nor insulin resistant,\nI think, again, it's\njust a transition period.\nAnd I'm not too\nworried about it.\nBut it is something\nimportant to keep in mind.\nAnd one of the reasons\nlike if somebody\nwas to transition out\nof keto, typically,\nif I'm working with them\nor one of our coaches\nare working with\nthem, we'll kind of\ninstruct them to do it like\nslowly and systematically\nover like a four to\neight-week period.\nThat way, hopefully, they're\nnot having that period\nof two weeks where\nthey're like, oh, man, why\ndo I feel so terrible?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\nvery important point.\nI want to go to the other end\nliterally and figuratively\nand talk about gut\nhealth, because up\nuntil now, and certainly--\nLAYNE NORTON: I see what\nyou did with that pun.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And certainly\nin the last few minutes,\nwe've been talking a lot\nabout top-down processes.\nThe brain, the psychology,\nplacebo effects,\nbut the very real\naspects of those,\nnot that I can imagine 2,000\ncalories, 1,000 calories\nand somehow change the\nlaw of thermodynamics.\nCan't do that.\nBut we've been\ntop-down in integrating\na lot of different\nideas into weight loss\nmaintenance and weight gain.\nBut gut health, at least\nthe more popular studies\non gut health, have blown a\nlot of things out of the water.\nFor instance, this idea that\nyou could take obese mice\nand literally give them fecal\ntransplants from lean mice,\nand yes, that sounds\nlike what it sounds like.\nFecal transplants definitely\ninserted through the same end\nin which it comes out.\nAnd I point that out because\na lot of people have asked me\nthat they-- and it was kind of\nscary to me, I thought, yes,\nthis is not about\ningesting feces, this is--\nthey literally do a transplant\nof these from lean mice\ninto obese mice and the\nobese mice get lean.\nAnd yes, this has\nbeen done in humans.\nLimited number of studies and\nobserved some pretty impressive\neffects on weight loss\nthat I have to assume\ncould be related\nto placebo effect.\nThey might have told these\nobese people, hey, look,\nyou're going to get lean\nthrough this fecal transplant\nfrom lean people.\nBut more likely,\nit had some effect\non their core physiology.\nI don't know which\naspects although,\nI can speculate which ones.\nAnd they became leaner.\nThey lost weight.\nAnd that is, in some sense,\nmiraculous, especially given\nthe important role of psychology\nand exercise and satiety\nsignals, because I'm going to\nassume that they controlled\nfor a number of those\nother variables,\nalthough no study is perfect.\nWhat are your thoughts\nabout gut health\nas it relates to metabolism,\nenergy utilization,\nand balance?\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo the first thing I'll say is\nI'm not a gut health expert,\nbut I will--\nI feel relatively comfortable\ntalking about it based\non conversations I've had\nwith people who are experts--\none being Suzanne\nDevkota who's--\nyou're familiar with her?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, she's sort\nof a phenom in this area\nfrom what I understood.\nLAYNE NORTON: So\nshe was actually\ndoing her masters when I was\ndoing my PhD in Lehman's lab.\nSo she was one of my lab mates.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific.\nLAYNE NORTON: And the\nother thing to say\nis, even gut health experts,\nand Suzanne will tell you this,\nthey're like, talk\nto me in 20 years.\nWe just know so little.\nI think that's an overall thing\nthat people don't understand\nis the scientific consensus\nmoves very, very slow, probably\nfor good reason.\nBecause if we just flipped\nour scientific consensus based\non one study, I mean,\nit would be a mess.\nSo it's going to take\ntime before we really\nunderstand the implications\nof the gut and what it means.\nSo when it comes to weight\nloss, there probably\nis a role in there.\nI mean, we've seen that\nthere's something going on.\nNow, whether that's-- is\nit something where a gut\nmicrobiome make makeup that's\nmore obese resistant, perhaps,\nit extracts less calories\nout of the food you eat.\nOr perhaps, it's elevating BMR.\nAlthough, I think that that's\nprobably somewhat unlikely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\nthink it could impact\nthe way satiety signals are?\nLAYNE NORTON: So that's--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean,\nback to the brain again.\nLAYNE NORTON: --so that's--\nwe know that there's a link\nin the gut brain axis.\nAnd so my suspicion\nis that it probably\nis working via\nappetite regulation.\nSo I mean, if we look at\nthe most effective obesity\ntreatments out there,\nwhich is like semaglutide,\nI mean, you\nconsistently see a 15%\non average loss of body\nweight, which is massive\nand people keep it off.\nThat is a GLP-1 mimetic\nwhich is a gut hormone.\nAnd it, basically, just is a\nvery, very powerful appetite\nsuppressant.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I\nguess I'm interrupting,\nbut hopefully, with a purpose.\nThere's this really\ninteresting study.\nAnd it's in mice,\nadmittedly, but published\nin a neuroscience\njournal recently.\nAnd basically, the takeaway\nis that like so many things\nin neuroscience, the GLP-1\nworks in two parallel pathways.\nIn the brain, it seems\nto impact neurons\nin the hypothalamus\nthat control satiety.\nSo exactly what you're saying.\nAnd in the gut,\nit seems to create\nan activation of the\nmechanosensors in the gut.\nSo the perception is that the\ngut is full even-- or fuller.\nI should say, not\nfull, because I\nthink people who take\nsemaglutide don't feel bloated.\nI don't know, they might.\nBut that one feels as if\ntheir gut is actually fuller\nbecause these mechanical\nsensors that send-- stretch\nare sending signals\nto the brain,\noh, I actually have some food.\nI'm not empty down there.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Anyway,\nI'm tickled by this result\nmostly because every time I\nhear about a drug or a molecule\nhaving an effect, we think it\nhas an effect at one location.\nBut it's kind of interesting\nthat, especially for something\nlike appetite regulation,\nthat it would be impacting\nbody and brain in parallel.\nAnyway, forgive me.\nLAYNE NORTON: That's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You can tell\nI'm really excited about this.\nAnd here you are telling\na neuroscientist, me,\nthat a lot, perhaps,\ncircles back to these brain\nmechanisms of satiety.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nI mean, I think that--\nand especially looking at\nthe research on leptin,\nyou we used to think,\nOK, metabolism is mostly\nlike liver-based\nand then there's\nmetabolism in the adipocyte\nand skeletal muscle.\nBut none of this stuff\nexists in isolation.\nThere's so much crosstalk\nbetween these pathways.\nAnd that's-- when we\nget into mechanisms--\nthough one of the things\nI love mechanisms.\nBut one of the\nthings I tell people\nis keep in mind that when\nyou're dealing with an outcome,\nlike when I say\noutcome-based, we're\ntalking about physical outcomes\nlike weight loss, fat loss,\nchanges in blood\nmarkers, whatever,\nthough that is the\nsummation of thousands\nof different mechanisms.\nSo sure, sometimes, you can\naffect a mechanistic pathway,\nand you get straight down the\nline outcome, but not always.\nWhenever you make a treatment\nor anything into the system,\nit's like throwing\na pebble in a lake.\nIt creates ripples.\nAnd we don't always know\nwhat those are going to be.\nAnd that's why-- I mean,\nwe've seen certain drugs,\nwhat works on this pathway.\nAnd then they list off\nall the side effects.\nAnd you go, well, how would it\ncreate that many side effects?\nBecause nothing--\nfor the most part,\nthey don't just\nwork in one place.\nThere's multitude\nof places it works.\nAnd to your point\nabout semaglutide\nand the effects on\nmechanical sensors,\nit's probably why\na lot of people\nreport actually low grade nausea\nwhen they're using semaglutide.\nBecause of that.\nBecause if you're-- that feeling\nis usually not like a real\ncomfortable feeling, but I mean,\nit will get you to not eat.\nSo I think there's absolutely\nlikely a connection,\nbut we haven't fully\nelucidated how that works.\nAnd we think about how\ncomplicated the gut is.\nI think I heard\nsomething like there's\nmore cells in our microbiome by\nfar than there are in our body.\nSo we're actually more--\nin terms of a cell\nper cell level,\nwe're actually more bacteria\nthan we are eukaryote.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: There's\nJustin Sonnenburg\nwho's one of the world\nexperts on microbiome.\nHe's in the lab upstairs\nfrom mine at Stanford.\nAnd he has this idea--\nit's just an idea that because\nwe are indeed more bacteria\nthan we are cells, the\nquestion is, who's the host\nand who's the passenger?\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe,\nwe are just-- maybe\nthey're exploiting us to take\nthem around and interact,\nbecause they interact\nand grow on one another.\nAnd so this idea that\nthis freaks people out,\nLex Fridman will love this.\nThat maybe human beings\nare just actually\nthe vehicles for the microbiome\nand not the other way around.\nAnyway, kind of a scary thought.\nDo you do anything specifically\nto support your gut microbiome?\nAre you a probiotic guy or a\nfermented foods guy or a fiber\nguy?\nLAYNE NORTON: So-- again, I'm\ngoing to kind of go straight\ndown the line from\nwhat I've heard\nfrom Suzanne and other experts.\nSo if you want to improve gut\nhealth, one of the biggest\nlevers--\nthe three biggest\nlevers you can pull\nis not eating too many\ncalories, exercising--\nthere is a connection\nbetween exercise and the gut,\nand fiber.\nSo it is-- of the\nthings we know,\ndietary fiber seems to\npositively impact the gut\nbecause it is what's\ncalled a prebiotic.\nSo your gut microbiota can\ntake, especially, soluble fiber.\nAlthough, there's actually some\nevidence, at least in mice,\nthat they might be able to use\nsome insoluble fiber as well.\nI think Suzanne was doing a\nstudy looking at hemicellulose\nand actually seeing that\nsome, like specific forms\nof microbiota, flourish with\nhemicellulose suggesting\nthat they may\nactually be getting\nsome kind of fuel out of it,\nwhich is really interesting.\nBut again, in mice--\nso just a huge caveat.\nSo your gut\nmicrobiome can produce\nthese short chain fatty acids\nby fermenting the soluble fiber.\nAnd there's quite\na bit of evidence\nthat these volatile fatty\nacids, which can be then\nactually reabsorbed\ninto the liver,\nthat they have some\npositive effects.\nLike for example, butyrate.\nWhen they've done\nbutyrate supplementation,\nthey've actually seen positive\neffects on insulin sensitivity.\nSo what we seem to understand\nis that more diversity seems\nto be better, fiber\nseems to be positive,\nprebiotics seem to work\nmuch better than probiotics.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSupplemented prebiotics.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yes.\nSo the problem with\nmost of the probiotics\nis they're typically\nnot concentrated enough\nto actually colonize.\nAnd even if you do colonize,\nwhat happens is like,\nlet's say you colonize\nsome microbiota that you\ndidn't really have much of.\nIf you're not fueling it\nwith the appropriate fiber,\nit's not going to stay anyway,\nbecause it's essentially\ngoing to starve.\nSo the research seems to\nreally clearly suggest\nthat eating enough fiber,\nwhich is, again, a prebiotic,\nthat that is a better way\nto get a healthier gut per\nse than probiotic.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nfiber sources do you use?\nAnd I think-- I mean, I realize\nthere's a huge array of choices\nout there, but people\nwill want to have\nsome ideas as to how\nthey could, perhaps,\nmimic what you're doing.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nAnd I would just say diversity.\nSo there's various evidence\nfrom various different fiber\nsources--\nfruits and vegetables,\nobviously, grains,\nsome whole grains, some cereals,\nand then various other sources.\nSo this is one of the\nthings where we don't really\nhave a good idea.\nIf you know this\none source of fiber\nis better than another\nsource of fiber,\nwe just know that fiber\noverall is pretty good.\nAnd one thing I'll\ntell people is\nlike if you want a\nlongevity hack, I mean,\nfiber is kind of\nthe longevity hack.\nIf you look at some of\nthese cohort studies,\nthere was actually a recent\nreally large meta analysis\nof over a million subjects.\nAnd basically, what it showed\nwas that for every 10 gram\nincrease in fiber, there\nwas a 10% reduction\nin the risk of mortality.\nAnd that extended, specifically,\nalso to cardiovascular disease\nand cancer.\nSo one of the things\nI'll tell people\nwhen they get like\nreally into whether it's\nintermittent fasting or\nall these other things,\nsay, that's great, that's great.\nAre you eating like over\n50, 60 grams of fiber a day?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nConceptualize 50 or 60 grams.\nSo if I were to eat\nlike a-- let's just say,\na quarter plate of\nbroccoli and the broccoli\nisn't stacked to the ceiling.\nThe broccoli is just\nreasonably stacked on there.\nApproximately, how many\ngrams of fiber is that?\nIf it's like two\ncups of broccoli.\nThere's a lot.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo like 200 grams of broccoli,\nper se, would probably be like\n5, 6 grams of fiber.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I need\nto get how much per day?\nLAYNE NORTON:\nWell, I would say--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Ideally.\nLAYNE NORTON: --typically,\nwhat the recommended dose\nis is 15 grams\nper 1,000 calories\nintake because if you're\neating low calories,\nit's difficult to\nget enough fiber in.\nBut based on-- and again,\nthese are cohort studies.\nBut you can't do 20-year\nlong randomized human control\ntrials, unfortunately.\nThat doesn't really appear\nto be a top end, at least\nfor the benefits of fiber.\nIt probably boils down to\nhow much you can tolerate\nwithout feeling uncomfortable.\nBecause if you're eating\nlike a ton of fiber, I mean,\nat some point, it's not\ngoing to be very comfortable.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nExercise becomes\nuncomfortable or hazardous.\nYeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: And I actually a--\nkind of touching on that\nbecause I think it is important.\nA lot of people have kind of--\nin the carnivore community said,\nwell, you don't need fiber,\nyou poop just fine without it.\nAnd I'll always say, well,\npooping is the last reason\nto have fiber.\nLike yes, it does help.\nIt does seem to make\nelimination easier,\nyou can do it more frequently,\nadds bulk to stool.\nBut that's not why\nyou should eat fiber.\nWhy should eat fiber is because\nof the effects of mortality.\nAnd some of the pushback\nwill be, well, this\nis healthy user bias.\nAnd what I'll say is--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning,\nhealthy people do this\nand therefore it's working.\nLAYNE NORTON: Healthy people\neat more fiber and therefore--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nYeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: And I mean, yeah.\nThere's something to that.\nBut if it was just\nhealthy user bias,\ntypically, you would\nsee some disagreement\nbetween the studies.\nAnd a great example of\nthat is like red meat.\nSo not every study shows\nred meat has an association\nwith cancer and mortality.\nThere's differences depending\non the population use,\ndepending on what they define\nas high red meat, low red meat,\nwhether it's\nprocessed, unprocessed.\nBut I have not found\na study on fiber\nand cardiovascular disease\nand cancer and mortality\nwhere it did not show\nimprovements from higher fiber.\nSo to me, that suggests\nthat that effect is real.\nAnd so again, as much fiber\nas you can get in comfortably,\nI would try to do\nit because it seems\nto have some really\npowerful effects\nand is good for\nthe gut microbiome.\nThe other thing that\nmay be a consideration\nfor the microbiome is\nthere's some evidence that\nsaturated fat may not be\ngreat for the microbiome.\nThat it reduces the\nprevalence of some\nof the more positive\nstrains of bacteria.\nAnd that appears to be not so\nmuch from the saturated fat\nitself but from the\nbile end products\nthat combine with\nsaturated fat seems\nto have a negative\neffect on some\nof these more healthier\nforms of gut microbiota.\nBut again, this is\nreally difficult\nbecause we don't\neven know necessarily\nyet which species\nof gut microbiota\nare positive or negative.\nAnd that's-- I mean, this gets\ninto some of these studies\nwhere they may\ncall it dysbiosis.\nSounds scary, but dysbiosis\njust means that the gut changed.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nLAYNE NORTON: It\ndoesn't necessarily--\nit doesn't tell you\nanything qualitative\nabout whether the\nchange was bad or good.\nAnd so these are\njust things, I think,\nwe need to keep in mind when\nwe talk about this stuff.\nThat this stuff is still\nvery much in its infancy.\nBut in terms of the\nbig levers, I mean,\nit's pretty much\nfits with what we\nknow about a healthy lifestyle.\nExercise, don't eat too much,\nconsume a good amount of fiber\nfrom diverse sources.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.\nFantastic because\nit fits with what\nI like to think of as the\ncenter of mass of evidence.\nAnd I'm starting to get\nsome window into what\nyour process is around selection\nof studies and no one study\nbeing wholly, but\nwhen you look at,\nas you mentioned, all\nthe studies on fiber\nhaving a positive effect\nto some degree or another,\nit's pretty hard to refute that\nthere isn't something really\ninteresting there.\nLAYNE NORTON: And one thing\nI'll tell people is like,\none study--\nI mean, sometimes\nI'll change my opinion\nbased on a single\nstudy when it's really\nwell done and very powerful.\nBut usually, one\nstudy is just going\nto move me just a little bit.\nAnd then maybe, if\nanother one comes out,\nmaybe a little bit more.\nAnd then like very slowly,\nI'm going to get some--\nI mean, my experience\nwith LDL cholesterol,\nthat's something I changed\nmy mind on a while back.\nWhen I was younger, like circa\n2005 getting into grad school,\nthe prevailing thought was,\nwell, it's not so much the LDL,\nit's the ratio of LDL to\nHDL, that's what matters.\nAnd probably about\nfive years ago--\nand I was pretty strong\nabout that opinion,\nand then five years ago\nlooking at these Mendelian\nrandomization studies, I went,\nI can't hold this position\nanymore.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What is\nyour revised position on LDL?\nLAYNE NORTON: So if you\nlook at the research,\nHDL is important because it's\na marker of metabolic health.\nIf you have high\nHDL, it suggests\nthat you are metabolically\nquite healthy.\nYou very rarely will you\nhave high HDL and high CRP,\nwhich is inflammatory marker\nor dysregulated blood glucose.\nAlmost exclusively,\npeople who have high HDL\nwill have good biomarkers\nof metabolic health.\nBut if you take\ndrugs that raise HDL,\nit doesn't reduce your risk\nof cardiovascular disease.\nIn Mendelian\nrandomization studies,\nwhich Mendelian\nrandomization basically\nuses natural randomization.\nSo some people are,\nin the case of HDL,\nnaturally higher secreted\nor naturally lower\nsecretions of HDL.\nAnd we talked about\nhow-- you can't really\ndo a 20-year human\nrandomized controlled trial.\nAnd when you're trying\nto examine something\nlike heart disease, I mean, that\nis a lifetime exposure issue.\nIt's very unlikely\nthat you're going\nto pick out differences between\ntreatments in two years or even\nfive years.\nI mean, people don't develop--\ntypically, don't\ndevelop heart disease\nuntil they're in their\n50s, 60s, and 70s.\nWhat Mendelian randomization\nallows is to say,\nOK, we have these people who\nnaturally secrete more or less.\nSo we can stratify those and\nlook at what is their risk.\nSo if you look at people\nwho are low series of HDL\nversus high secrete\nof HDL withholding\nsome of the other key\nvariables consistent like LDL,\nyou don't see an effect\non heart disease, really.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Of LDL.\nLAYNE NORTON: Of HDL.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it, OK.\nLAYNE NORTON: But\nwhen you look at LDL\nand you look at the\nlifetime exposure to LDL,\nit is like a linear\neffect on heart disease.\nAnd we know that it's\nactually not so much LDL,\nbut it's more\napolipoprotein B. But that\ntends to track with\nLDL just in general.\nAnd if you look\nat the mechanism--\nI mean, we know that LDL can\npenetrate the endothelium,\nso there's the\nmechanism is present.\nIf we look at the\nepidemiology, it\nsupports that it's an\nindependent risk factor,\nand then, again, these\nMendelian randomization\nstudies where we can\nlook at people's exposure\nover a lifetime, and then we\nsee that linear dose-dependent\neffect.\nTo me, that was\nconvincing enough\nto change my mind on\nthat particular topic.\nAnd then if you look at\nsome of the Framingham data,\nlook at high--\nif you like stratify, like\nhigh HDL versus low HDL,\nboth groups looking at\nhigh LDL and low LDL.\nSo if you have\nhigh HDL, low LDL,\nyou will still be lower\nrisk factor than somebody\nwho is high HDL and high LDL.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthe ratio does matter.\nLAYNE NORTON: The\nratio does better.\nSame thing with inflammation.\nIf you look at people who are\nlow inflammation, low LDL,\nthey'll have a lower\nrisk than people who\nare low inflammation, high LDL.\nSo again, that was sufficient\nfor me to change my mind.\nBut it took-- it was like\nnot just one study came out.\nIt was, OK, then there was\nanother study, and then\nanother study, ans then another\nstudy, and at a certain point\nI go, OK, well, now, I\neither have to change my mind\nor I'm, basically, just going\nto be cognitively dissonant\nand say, nope, I don't\nbelieve all that.\nAnd so I think that's one of\nthe things to keep in mind.\nPeople will say, oh, are you\nsaying this is a bad study?\nVery rarely will I call\nsomething, a bad study,\nbecause data is just data.\nBut the issue becomes\nhow it is presented\nand how broadly it's applied\nin the mainstream media\nor by people on--\nfitness influencers.\nAnd what I'll do\nis try to step in\nand say, OK, let's consider\nx, y and z as well.\nAnd then it's not a bad\nstudy, but let's just\nbe careful about how broadly\nwe apply the interpretation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWell, and I think you are in\na very unique and important\nposition to be able\nto place things\ninto their proper\ncontext because of this,\nfor lack of a better\nword, holistic view\nof how the psychology\nplacebo effects also core\nphysiology relate\nto one another.\nAnd so on.\nIn fact, I think that your\ntraining as a biochemist\nand then training as in\nnutrition with somebody who--\nDon Lemon, who was pushing\nyou to focus on outcomes,\nI think that's a\nbeautiful capture\nof the continuum at which\none can look at something.\nBecause for those of\nyou who don't out there,\nyou know a lot of laboratory\nstudies on mice and humans,\nfor instance, in the\nrealm of biochemistry\nor in vitro studies, you'll\nsee a change in some molecule\ncan be quite dramatic.\nAnd then the assumption\nis, oh, you just\ntake-- you take the\ndrugs that will change\nthat molecule in a\nparticular direction,\nand then you'll get the effect\nyou want at the whole organism\nlevel.\nThe person will lose weight,\nthe person will gain muscle,\nthe animal will not have\nAlzheimer's, et cetera.\nBut it just doesn't work that\nway because of the redundancy,\nand this interplay.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well, a\ngreat example of that\nis, so my research was\nactually in rodents.\nAll my studies on protein\nmetabolism, and leucine,\nin particular, is\nwhat we were studying.\nWell, we know if\nyou give leucine,\nit increases muscle\nprotein synthesis.\nBut we also know if you\nsupplement with leucine,\npeople don't get more muscular.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nwas about to say--\nLAYNE NORTON: So as always--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--all you have to do\nis supplement with leucine?\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nRight, right.\nAnd so how is that possible?\nMuscle building is not\njust protein synthesis.\nIt's also the balance between\nsynthesis and degradation.\nAnd degradation just happens\nto be very, very difficult\nto measure.\nBut a great example--\nand again, one of the\ncool things about my PhD\nwas actually changed\nthe way I ate,\nwhich I think is interesting.\nSo before, I had been like,\nI eat eight meals a day,\neat every two\nhours, try to keep--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nEight meals a day?\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah when\nI got to grad school.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In\norder to get that 30\ngrams of protein per meal?\nLAYNE NORTON: Get that\namino drip going in\nwas the idea, right?\nLike just have an IV\nhooked up of amino acids.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNot really, folks.\nLAYNE NORTON: Not really, yeah.\nBut that was the concept.\nBut the first study that I did,\nwe, basically, looked at OK,\na lot of people had measured the\namplitude of protein synthesis\nin response to a meal.\nWe wanted to see, how\nlong does this last\nand where does it peak, right?\nAnd so my thought was, OK.\nWell, it'll probably\ntrack with plasma leucine.\nFor those that are\nnot familiar, leucine\nis the amino acid that\nis almost exclusively\nresponsible for increasing\nmuscle protein synthesis when\nyou eat protein.\nSo it's one of the\nbranched chain amino acids.\nSo we wanted to see, OK, how\nlong does this effect last?\nSo we fed these\nanimals whey protein,\nand again, I thought, OK, well,\nhowever long plasma leucine,\nstay up that, will be how long\nprotein synthesis stays up.\nAnd so we got the protein\nsynthesis data back,\nand it was peaked at\n90 minutes-- or sorry.\nPeaked from 45 to\n90 minutes and, then\nwas back down to\nbaseline by 180 minutes.\nAnd so when I went to do\nthe plasma leucine analysis,\nmy shock was, at three hours,\nplasma leucine was still\nplateaued out.\nAnd then I said,\nOK, well, when I\nlook at the initiation factors,\nthat will show me something.\nSo for those not\nfamiliar, this is part\nof the mTOR signaling pathway.\nSo one of the--\ntwo of the targets\nof mTOR, when it's stimulated--\nand leucine stimulates mTOR.\nTwo of the targets of mTOR are a\nprotein compound called 4E-BP1.\nAnd then another one is called\na ribosomal protein S6K.\nSo I don't want to get\ninto the specifics about it\nbecause it's going\nto be on the scope.\nBut basically, when these things\nare phosphorylated by mTOR,\nit increases the rate of\ntranslation initiation, which\ntranslation initiation\nis, basically,\nthe process of the ribosome\nhooking on to the mRNA\nand then starting\nprotein synthesis.\nSo I was looking at\nthe phosphorylation\nof 4E-BP1 and RPS6.\nI was like, OK,\nwell, I'll probably\nsee these things come\ndown in three hours.\nStill plateaued.\nAnd so then it was like,\nwhat's going on here?\nSo I actually kept rerunning\nthe data and rerunning the data\nand rerunning the data.\nAnd I'll never forget, I\nwent into Lehman's office.\nAnd this is like six\nmonths after we've\ndone this study, because\nthis analysis takes time.\nI was like, so where are we\nwith this duration study?\nI said, well, I just got to\nrun the plasma data again\nbecause it's not right.\nAnd he's like, well,\nwhy is it not right?\nAnd I said, well,\nit just doesn't\nmake any sense you know.\nAnd I kind of went through,\nhe's like well, describe to me\nyour technique.\nHow are you doing this?\nAnd I described it,\nand he said, well,\nhow is your standard error?\nAnd I told him what the\nnumbers were, he said,\nit sounds like it's good data.\nHe said, it sounds\nlike you are trying\nto get the data to\nfit your conclusion\nand you need to change your\nconclusion to fit the data.\nAnd that statement--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This\nis why we do PhDs.\nLAYNE NORTON: This\nis why, yeah--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nneed an advisor--\nLAYNE NORTON: This is why I\nam so skeptical of everything,\nbecause I have had so many of\nmy ideas crushed by my own data,\nright?\nSo we actually ended up--\nthis kind of effect,\nthis phenomenon\nis called muscle protein\nsynthetic refractory period.\nSo basically, like once\nyou trigger the system,\nruns for a defined\nperiod of time\nand then it takes time\nto, essentially, reset\nfor lack of a better term.\nIt's also been referred to\nas the muscle full effect.\nSo I looked at that\nand said, why am I\neating every two hours then?\nAnd there was even a study\nout of Wolf's Lab back in '99,\nI think, where they infused\nessential amino acids\nfor six hours.\nProtein synthesis went\nup, peaked at 60 minutes,\ncame back down 120, and\nnever went back up again.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMaybe I'm being naive.\nBut I would have thought that\nif protein synthesis goes\nup and then comes back down,\nthat eating more often would\nbe exactly the thing you would\nwant to do if your goal was\nto get increased protein\nsynthesis because you'd\nbe pinging the\nsystem periodically.\nLAYNE NORTON: But the problem\nis, the plasma amino acids\nare still elevated.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nit's, essentially,\nlike eating the whole way\nthrough from the perspective\nof leucine.\nLAYNE NORTON: From\nthe cells, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nLAYNE NORTON: So that was\none of those things where\nI said, you know what?\nI'm actually going to eat\nless often, because if I'm\neating in three hours\nlater, I've still got capped\nout plasma amino acids.\nAnd we looked at\nall kinds of stuff.\nWe looked at intracellular\nleucine just to make sure that\nwasn't falling off, it wasn't.\nWe looked at all the plasma,\nessential amino acids\nbecause we were thinking,\nwell, maybe protein synthesis\nis sucking some of these\namino acids out of the plasma\nand they're dropping\nand that's causing it\nto short circuit the system.\nThat wasn't the case.\nIt just-- essentially,\nwhat the evidence suggests,\nI think we're the only\nones to show this so far.\nSo I'm not ready to say\nthat this is a real effect,\nbecause I hold out the idea\nthat data artifacts do exist\nand you can't be totally sure.\nBut we saw an\nincrease in AMP kinase\naround this mark where protein\nsynthesis started falling off.\nAnd we also saw a decrease\nin intracellular ATP.\nAnd protein synthesis is\nan ATP-dependent process.\nAnd so what we think\nmight be happening is,\nyou're consuming\nprotein and you're--\nyou're increasing muscle\nprotein synthesis,\nand then at a\ncertain point, it has\nenough effect on your energy\nmetabolism in your cells\nthat it short--\nnot short circuits it,\nbut it cuts it off, right?\nSo again, we're the\nonly ones to show that.\nThat I'm aware of.\nAnd that was again, in rats.\nSo I always talk about data.\nLike, there's data I'm\nwilling to bet my toe on,\nmy foot on, my leg\non, and my life on.\nI'd probably barely bet the end\nof my little toe on that one.\nI'm not quite sure.\nBut it's interesting\nnonetheless.\nSo--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\nproportional wait here.\nLAYNE NORTON: --that's a\ngreat example of, OK, we're\nlooking at this mechanism\nof mTOR signaling,\nand if we just looked\nat that, we'd say,\noh, well, protein\nsynthesis is going to stay\nelevated for past three hours.\nBut that's not what we saw.\nSo yeah.\nI think, it's, again, that's\nwhy I really try to get people\nto say, well, let's--\nmechanisms are important.\nAnd especially, if\nyou're seeing an outcome,\nit's important to\nidentify mechanisms\nthat may explain that.\nBut let's step back\nfrom the mechanisms\nfrom trying to chase mechanisms.\nAnd let's look at\nchasing outcomes\nin terms of what we\nrecommend to people.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nExcellent point.\nIn terms of chasing outcomes,\na number of people I know\nare interested in weight\nloss or weight maintenance.\nAnd several times throughout\ntoday's conversation,\nwe've come back to this\nissue of satiety signals.\nWhether or not there are\nbrain-based, body-based,\nor both.\nNot wanting to eat\nmore is a great way\nto maintain or lose\nweight because you simply\ndon't want to.\nI heard you mention\nearlier that protein\nand maybe specific types of\nprotein or sources of protein\nmay provide better\nsatiety signals\nthan other macronutrients.\nCould you briefly talk\nabout how macronutrients,\nincluding protein, but also\ncarbohydrates and fats,\nimpact satiety.\nAnd from the\nstandpoint of somebody\nwho, for instance, would\nlike to quote unquote, \"lose\na few pounds,\" right?\nProbably would be happy to gain\na little bit of lean body mass\nprovided it was in a\nparticular location\non their body, that\nseems to be a thing now.\nDirected hypertrophy,\nif you will.\nAnd how much they should focus\non protein as a core component\nof creating this diet.\nAssuming everything else\nis being done correctly.\nThey're going to hit the\nright number of calories\nrelative to their\noutput NEAT, et cetera.\nHow should we think about\nprotein and satiety signals?\nAnd are animal sources\nof protein, indeed,\nmore bioavailable?\nThat's a tricky word.\nFor sake of muscle\nbuilding, but also\nfor sake of somebody who just\nwould like to lose body fat.\nThey don't want to\nlose muscle and they'd\nlike to bring their\nweight down a few pounds.\nLAYNE NORTON: So\na lot of things--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --or more.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nA lot of things to unpack there.\nOf the macronutrients,\nprotein is definitely\nthe biggest lever that you\ncan pull, because even if--\nit doesn't take a ton of protein\nto get a lot of the muscle\nbuilding benefits.\nI mean, I think\nthe benefits really\nstart to plateau out around\n1.6 grams per kilogram\nof body weight.\nThere's some evidence\nthat maybe even\nup to like 2.4 or\n2.8 grams per kilo\nmay give a little\nbit more benefit.\nI think it probably\nlooks something\nlike an asymptote\nin terms of a curve\nwhere as you put\nmore into the system,\nyou always get a\nlittle bit more,\nbut it just gets to the point\nwhere it's so infinitesimally\nsmall benefit that it's for all\nintensive purposes, no benefit.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But you\nmentioned 1.6 grams of protein\nper kilogram of body\nweight, would you\nconsider that a threshold\nthat most people\nshould try and achieve daily?\nLAYNE NORTON: I see very few\ndownsides to hitting that.\nI mean, I know some\npeople-- and this\nis going to get into a\nseparate conversation.\nBut I know some\npeople will say, well,\nI don't want to stimulate\nmTOR because that's\ngoing to make me die early.\nAnd I think, one of\nthe things to keep\nin mind is if you look at--\nthere's kind of\nthis thought process\nout there that if\nyou're stimulating mTOR,\nthat protein is going\nto make you die early.\nAnd first off, we have\nvery little human outcome\ndata to support that claim.\nAnd the second thing\nis, if you look\nat any macronutrient\nisolation, I\ncan make a mechanistic argument\nthat it's going to kill you.\nSo fat-- if you take\nin fat and it decreases\nflow-mediated dilation.\nFlow-mediated dilation is\nimportant for heart health\nin the short term.\nCarbohydrates stimulate insulin.\nInsulin, you know,\npro-inflammatory\nand all these other things.\nAnd so I can make an argument\nfor any single macronutrient\nto be negative for longevity.\nI really want people--\nthis is something that\neven scientists get wrong.\nThey look at an acute\nresponse of something\nand assume that is going to\nrelate to long term outcomes\nand signaling.\nSo let's just take\nexercise, for example.\nIf you didn't know\nanything about exercise,\nand I said to you, Andrew,\nI'm going to do something\nthat's going to make you--\nyour heart rate go up,\nyour blood pressure go up, your\ninflammatory markers go up,\nyour reactive oxygen species\nincrease, you're going to say--\nand it's going to damage your\nmuscles, you're going to say,\nI'm not doing that.\nThat sounds horrible.\nBut it does all those\nthings in the short term.\nBut what is the long\nterm effect of exercise?\nYou actually get healthier.\nAll those things improve.\nNow, I'm not saying that\nprotein is a longevity hack\nor anything like that,\nbut what I'm saying is,\nI think some of\nthe arguments out\nthere are based on mechanistic--\nthis increases mTOR, therefore\nwe don't want to do it.\nI think it is a much more\ncomplicated argument than just\nthat.\nSo there's that.\nSo protein is the biggest lever.\nI would shoot for 1.6\ngrams per kilogram.\nIf you can do more, great.\nThere doesn't seem to be\nreally downsides to it.\nEven up to very high\nlevels of protein.\nJose Antonio did\na study, that was\na year-long randomized\ncontrol trial.\nAnd again, it's just one year.\nBut they were looking at all\nsorts of different biomarkers.\nAnd basically, even up to like\n4 grams per kilogram of protein,\nthey couldn't really find\nany negative health outcomes\nfrom it other than people were\njust so satiated, they ended up\neating less calories.\nSo protein is a big\nlever, because one, it\nhas a higher thermic\neffect of food,\nso you're getting a little\nbit more calorie burn per day\neven though it's not\na ton because TEF\nis a pretty small percentage\nof your overall energy\nexpenditure.\nBut still a benefit.\nYou're getting the\neffects on lean body mass.\nIf you're in a diet, it's going\nto help preserve lean body\nmass, if you're at\nmaintenance, it's\ngoing to help build a\npreserved lean body mass,\nand if you're in a\nsurplus, it's going\nto help build a\npreserved lean body mass.\nThen you get the\neffects on appetite.\nSo now, I want to be careful\nbecause appetite effects tend\nto be very specific\nto individual foods.\nSo you can take a\nhigh protein food\nand make it not very satiating.\nSo take, for example, like\na really tasty protein\nbar, which back when we\nwere getting into this,\nno such thing existed.\nNow, you have protein bars that\nactually take pretty darn good.\nBut if you eat one of them, I\nmean, are you really satiated?\nI don't really feel satiated,\nthat's my protein bar.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\nmy premeal snack.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nRight.\nSo why?\nBecause, I mean, it's\nprocessed, refined,\nand made to be very palatable.\nBut take something like a\n200-gram chicken breast.\nVery satiating, right?\nAnd that's why when people\nsay, well, carbohydrates\naren't very satiating, it\ndepends on the carbohydrate.\nI mean, when you look\nat the satiety index,\na plain baked potato is about\nas satiating as it gets.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If I\neat a bowl of oatmeal,\nI feel pretty good afterward.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nFor a while, right?\nI mean, I usually--\nI'll eat that along\nwith some other things,\nbut I completely agree.\nSo you're saying that the\nform that it comes in, maybe,\neven how much chewing\nis required, how good.\nIt smells that your\npsychological associations--\nbecause to me, a steak\nis an incredible meal.\nI mean, if I had to pick\none food that I could eat,\neven though I'm\nnot pure carnivore,\nfor the rest of my life, it\nwould be that because, I think,\nit would get me\nwhere I need to go\nand then I'd probably\nhave to sneak some fiber.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nit's an excellent point.\nI have a question that I don't\nwant to take us off track,\nbut I'm hoping it relates enough\nthat you could answer it now.\nIn the context of\nthis, if I'm going\nto eat let's say, 2 grams per\nkilogram of body weight protein\nand I'm not eating\nmultiple meals,\nmaybe I'm eating two\nor three meals per day,\nI'm certainly going\nto be eating more\nthan the 30-gram threshold\nthat was thrown around\nfor a long time that\nwe can only assimilate\n30 grams of protein per meal.\nShould I just not\nworry about that?\nSome of it is going to go\ntowards the thermic effect\nof food, some of that\nmight be converted\ninto glucose of all things\nthrough gluconeogenesis.\nSo should I worry about\nthis 30-gram cut off?\nBecause I think balancing the\n1.6 gram per kilogram body\nweight threshold\nwith number of meals,\nwith the need to exercise\nand work and live my life\nand sleep, et\ncetera, pretty soon,\nyou run into bottlenecks\nwhere you just can't do it\nor you're spending so much\ntime trying to focus on it.\nLAYNE NORTON: You can't\noptimize all the things\nat the same time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You'd lose\nyour mind and your body.\nSo what is necessary\nin terms of frequency\nif one is getting\nenough protein?\nAnd then tied into\nthat question,\nis there any\nreality to this idea\nthat if you eat one meal\nper day or you're fasting\nand then you eat, let's\nsay, 200 grams of protein\nin a single feeding, that you\ncan assimilate more because you\nwere protein starved.\nIs that a real thing?\nLAYNE NORTON: So most of\nthe studies with protein\nare after a fast because to\nassess it with stable isotope,\nyou have to be in\na steady state.\nSo we haven't observed that.\nIt doesn't appear\nthat fasting really\nallows you to assimilate\nmore protein after a fast.\nSo this gets into a core\nof one of the things I\nlooked at in my\nPhD, which is, does\nprotein distribution matter?\nBecause most Americans get about\n65% to 70% of their protein\nat dinner.\nBreakfast tends to be pretty\nminimal protein foods.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do\nany cultures, actually,\neat big breakfast and not\na big lunch and dinner?\nWe all heard that was ideal.\nWe'll get into circadian\ntiming in a little bit,\nbut does anyone\nactually do that?\nSteak and eggs for\nbreakfast and then\ntaper off the rest of the day?\nLAYNE NORTON: I\nknow German culture\ntends to have a big\nbreakfast, but also\ntends to be like sugary\nfoods and whatnot.\nAs far as like teleological, I'm\nactually not sure about that.\nSo if you look at\nthat, and then you\nconsider that protein\ndoesn't really\nhave a storage mechanism.\nPeople will say, well, lean\ntissue is a storage mechanism.\nThat's like saying a house is\na storage facility for wood.\nYeah, if the house\nis made out of wood\nyou could get wood out of it,\nbut that's not why you build.\nYou're building the\nhouse out of a demand.\nSame thing for muscle tissue.\nThere is a free\npool of amino acids,\nbut it's very, very small.\nSo when you consider things\nlike fat, which, basically,\nhas unlimited storage capacity,\ncarbohydrate, at relatively\nlarge storage\ncapacity, you can store\n400 or 500 grams of carbohydrate\nbetween your liver and muscles.\nAnd then protein, which almost\nhas no storage capacity,\nthe idea that, OK,\nyou could make up\nfor a low protein at one\nmeal by over consuming\nanother meal didn't\nmake sense to me.\nSo one of the studies we did--\nand again, in rats, we took--\nboth groups were getting whey\nprotein, so a high quality\nprotein, they were getting\nthe exact same amount\nof calories, exact same amount\nof nitrogen, exact same macros.\nEverything was the same.\nThe only difference was,\none group, basically,\ngot three meals of similar\namounts of protein.\nDinner was a little\nbit bigger, because we\nwanted to keep it somewhat\nsimilar to how people eat.\nBut each meal was going to be\nover the threshold to stimulate\nmuscle protein synthesis.\nWhereas the other\ngroup, I constructed it\nso the first two\nmeals of the day\nshould not stimulate\nmuscle protein synthesis.\nIt should be under\nthat threshold.\nAnd then the last\nmeal was about 70%\nof their total daily protein.\nAnd so we had them eat\nthose for 11 weeks.\nAnd I'll never forget this.\nThis is how obsessive\nI became about it\nis, there were 110\nanimals in the study,\nand I made all the\ndiets and I weighed out\nexactly every single meal\nfor every single animal\nfor 11 weeks.\nSo I was in there at 6:00\nAM, I was in there at noon,\nand I was in there at 6:00 PM.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nThat's kind of PhD student\nthat professors dream of.\nYou're sounding a dream student.\nLAYNE NORTON: So at\nthe end of 11 weeks,\nwe looked at like lean body\nmass, we looked at body fat,\nwe looked at hind limb weights.\nWe didn't really see\ndifferences in lean body mass,\nbut what we did see\nwas a difference\nin hind limb weights.\nIt wasn't massive, but there\nwas a significant difference\nin the size of the\nmuscles of the hind limbs\nof these animals.\nAnd so it's interesting\nthat there wasn't\na difference in lean body mass.\nAnd what we found, at least\nwith the liver, the animals\nthat we're eating one meal\nwith really high protein,\nactually had bigger livers,\nnot like a huge amount and not\nsomething that I\nwould consider unsafe,\nbut it was a statistically\nsignificant difference.\nAnd so to me, at\nleast, like I'm trying\nto explain like no\ndifference in lean body mass,\nbut a difference in\nthese hind limb weights,\nmaybe there's some\nsequestering of--\nthat's fueling a little\nbit more protein synthesis\nof the splenic\ntissues rather than--\nbecause you're capping out\nskeletal muscle protein\nsynthesis.\nAnd we do know that the\nsplanchnic tissues are\nmore sensitive or\nhave a greater rate\nof protein synthesis per day.\nLike, the rate of skeletal\nmuscle protein synthesis\nin humans is about\nlike 1% per day.\nSo it takes like 100 days to\nturn over skeletal muscle.\nWhereas like your entire\ngut, your entire GI\nwill turn itself over in\nlike two to three days.\nSo really-- and the liver\nalso has a very high amount\nof protein synthesis, which\nis one of the reasons.\nIt's actually one of the most\nmetabolically active organs.\nSo all that to say, it has not--\nthere's been one human study\nthat showed something similar.\nAnd then there's been a\ncouple of others that didn't.\nAnd then in the intermittent\nfasting studies, which is maybe\na good tool to look at\ncompared to continuous feeding,\none thing I will say is\nit looks like the 16/8\nintermittent fasting style.\nThere's been a couple of\nstudies with Grant Tinsley.\nAnd this is something I've\nchanged my mind on as well.\nGrant Tinsley has done\na couple of studies\nwhere they did use\nthe 16/8 protocol.\nThey had them train during\ntheir feeding window,\nand they had them eat--\nI think it was at least three\nprotein-containing meals\nduring those eight hours.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThese are humans?\nLAYNE NORTON: These are humans.\nAnd they saw no difference\nin lean body mass\nat the end of the study\ncompared to people\nwho were eating as many times as\nthey wanted throughout the day.\nNow, if you look at some of the\nmore extreme forms of fasting,\nlike alternate day fasting\nor like 20/2 or 20/4,\nthere are some studies where\nyou do start to see differences\nin lean body mass.\nSo my suspicion is,\nand I'm just guessing.\nSo this is tenuous.\nMy suspicion is,\nprobably if you're\ngetting like two to three high\nquality protein meals in a day,\nyou're getting the vast majority\nof the benefits of protein.\nThe most important thing\nis getting enough total.\nAnd then secondarily,\ntrying to get at least two\nor three meals with\nhigh quality protein in.\nBut if you're going pretty\nextreme with like alternate day\nfasting or maybe\nonly one meal a day,\nthen I think there may be some\neffects on lean body mass.\nBut again, these can be\nmitigated as well if you're\ndoing hard resistance training.\nTypically, that is\nthe biggest lever\nin terms of lean body mass.\nYes, protein distribution\nmay make a difference,\nbut I'm trying to put\nit in context so people\ndon't feel like they need to go\nout and eat four meals a day.\nBut again, so what I would say\nis like some of the more milder\nforms of time-restricted\neating appear\nto be fine for lean\nbody mass, now,\nthe caveat is the following.\nOne of the nice things\nabout animal studies\nis when you\nconsider-- if you want\nto have a high subject\nnumber, high level of control\nin a long duration, it's\npretty much your only option.\nSo in our research\nreview reps, I\ncreated a Venn diagram,\nwhich basically\nis like three circles\ncrossing over.\nOne is study duration,\none is level of control,\nand the other one\nis subject number.\nAnd to get all three of\nthose circles to cross over,\nit almost has to be an animal's.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nAnd REPS, it's a\nnewsletter or a book?\nLAYNE NORTON: So it's our\nmonthly research review.\nSo every month we review like\nfive studies that come out\nin fitness and nutrition.\nWe'll usually do at least\none nutrition, one training,\nand one supplement per month.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe will put a link\nto where people can sign up.\nThis is a sign up format?\nGreat.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo it's a\nsubscription-based service.\nSo basically, when-- people\nmight look at my study, well,\nwhy did you see difference\nin muscle weights\nwhereas some of these other\nstudies don't see a difference?\nI weighed out every\nsingle meal for 11 weeks,\nand keep in mind that 11\nweeks in a rodent's lifespan\nis a really long time.\nThat's about an 1/8 of\ntheir total lifespan.\nSo is it that there's\nno effect or is it\nthat the effect is\nrelatively small\nand would take a really long\ntime and very high level\nof control to see in humans?\nI don't know.\nBut I think what I would say\nrelatively confidently is\nif you're going to do like\na 16/8 intermittent fasting,\nyou're probably fine.\nEspecially-- and again,\nwhat is the goal?\nLike if you're a\nbodybuilder looking\nto be the most massive\nperson you possibly can\nor you're a football\nplayer or you're\nin some field that having as\nmuch lean body mass as possible\nis really important for\nyou, then I would say,\nwell, you're not really\ngaining a whole lot\nby doing some form of\ntime-restricted eating.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think most\nof the people listening to this\ndo not fall into that category.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think most\npeople want to maintain or lose\nweight.\nThey'd like to,\nperhaps, add a bit of,\nquote unquote, shape or muscle\nto specific areas of their body\nand lose body fat.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nAnd I think your normal\nforms of time-restricted,\nand you're probably\nperfectly fine for that.\nAnd again, I don't want\nsomebody to think, well,\nI do alternate day\nfasting, there's\nno point to me resisting\ntraining because I'm\ngoing to lose muscle mass.\nNo.\nNo, no, no, no.\nYou can still build\nmuscle doing that.\nYou just might not\nbuild as much muscle\nas you would if you were eating\nin a more traditional format.\nBut if that's something that\nworks for you and your goals,\nand especially, if it's fat loss\nor controlling your calories,\nthen again, it's about the\nhierarchy of what's important.\nSo to answer your question, I do\nthink that timing and frequency\nmatters a little--\nnot so much frequency,\nbut distribution more so.\nSo I think the\ndistribution matters,\nbut it's a much smaller\nlever than just getting\nenough total protein in.\nAnd then as far as\nanimal versus plant,\nI used to be in the\ncamp of, there's\nno way somebody can\nbuild as much muscle\non a plant-based diet.\nAnd now, I think I've\ncome back to, you can,\nit just requires a\nlittle bit more planning.\nAnd I don't want to say\nalways, but it's very difficult\nto do without an isolated\nsource of protein.\nSo unless you're going to\nsupplement with an isolated\nplant source of protein,\nit's very difficult\nto get enough without going\nover on total calories\nbecause you can figure\nthat, especially,\nlike take somebody who may\nbe calorically restricted,\ntrying to get enough protein\nfrom whole intact plant\nsources.\nSo you've got a few different\nthings working against you.\nOne, the sources of protein\nyou're consuming also\nhave carbohydrate and/or fat.\nTwo, it's a less bioavailable\nform of protein, and three,\nit's a lower quality of protein\nin terms of it has, typically,\nless leucine, less\nbranched amino acids,\nand less essential amino acids.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You answer\nthe question that I almost\ninterrupted you\nto ask, which was,\ndoes it boil down to\nthe leucine content?\nAnd it sounds like that\nis one of the components.\nAnd that a lot of the\nvegan and vegetarian\nsources of excellent protein,\nthat excellent protein\nvegetarian or vegan source\nis co-packaged with calories\nfrom carbohydrates\nand/or fat that\nmake it hard to stay under\nthe caloric threshold.\nWhereas a steak is--\nI'm not-- and\nobviously, people might\nwant to avoid that\nfor ethical reasons.\nLAYNE NORTON: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's\na different matter entirely.\nBut a steak or a piece of\nchicken or an egg is-- well,\nan egg has a yolk which\nis, there's fat there.\nBut is almost a pure\nprotein, fat source.\nThere's no carbohydrate\nalong for the ride.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nSo I think what I would\nsay is that, you can do it.\nTakes a little more planning.\nAnd you're almost always-- if\nyou're a vegan, especially,\nyou're going to be\nbetter off like something\nwith some isolated form\nof protein or vegan\nform of protein.\nNow, this word gets\ninto people say, well,\nwhat about the\nlimiting amino acids\nand those sorts of things?\nIt's a consideration.\nSome of the better\nforms of vegan protein\nin terms of amino acid\ncontent are like soy.\nNow, I hear everybody\nscreaming online\nabout their testosterone levels.\nIn terms of actual outcomes\nand looking at testosterone,\nthere was a recent meta\nanalysis looking at soy.\nAnd I think if it's your\nonly source of protein,\nthen maybe the\ndosage is high enough\nto cause some weird effects.\nBut if you're just using it\nlike once or twice a day,\nit doesn't seem to have\nan effect on testosterone\nor estrogen. So that can be\na decent source of protein,\nbecause it is a\ncomplete protein source.\nIt does have a PD cause of one,\nwhich PD cause is basically\na measure of protein\nquality based on,\ndoes it provide enough\nof all the amino acids\nso that none are limiting?\nAnd so soy is one of the only\nvegan sources that does that.\nInterestingly, potato\nprotein isolate\nactually has a similar essential\namino acid content to whey.\nSo isolated potato protein.\nIt's just really hard to find.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nLAYNE NORTON: I've\nbeen trying to source--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nvegans take note,\nvegetarians take note, because--\nor vegans rather, because\nwhey is vegetarian,\nand whey is a very high\nquality protein as far as--\nLAYNE NORTON: Very\nhigh quality proteins.\nAnd actually-- they're actually\ncreating whey now out of--\nI think it's--\nI may mischaracterize this.\nBut I believe they're able to\nproduce it out of like yeast\nor something like that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.\nLAYNE NORTON: That--\nso for vegans, now,\nthis is a great\noption because you\ncan have whey that's\nnot animal-based\nthat is going to be every bit\nas good as an animal-based whey.\nSo I think that's great.\nGetting to the leucine--\nlet me go back, sorry.\nSo another reason that using an\nisolated protein can be helpful\nis because it's\nmore bioavailable\nas well when it's\nbeen isolated out.\nWhen the protein bound up in\nthe actual plant material,\nit tends to be\nless bioavailable.\nNow, cooking can help\nincrease the bioavailability\nbecause it breaks some of\nthose bonds and whatnot.\nBut it still seems to be lower.\nAnd you don't-- it's\nreally interesting.\nThere was a recent study where\nthey did a corn, wheat, and pea\nblend of protein versus whey.\nAnd basically, the\noutcome was, 30 grams\nof each stimulated protein\nsynthesis to a similar degree.\nBut the plasma amino acids\nin the plant-based protein\nstill did not get as\nhigh as with whey.\nNow, it may be that that's\njust-- it doesn't matter\nbecause once you get\nto a certain level,\nyou get all the benefits.\nBut I still found it\ninteresting nonetheless\nthat they didn't\nquite get as high.\nThe other thing to consider with\nthe vegan sources of protein\nis the leucine content.\nSo one of the studies\nwe did was we looked\nat wheat, soy, egg, and whey.\nIsonitrogenous,\nmeaning we equated\nprotein between the\ngroups, isocaloric,\nwe equated calories.\nAnd we looked at muscle\nprotein synthesis.\nAnd I think this was-- the\nmeals were 15% of total energy\nfrom protein.\nSo like your food guide\npyramid level of protein.\nAnd we saw that in the\nwheat and soy group,\nthey did not increase\nmuscle protein synthesis,\nbut the egg and whey group\nincreased muscle protein\nsynthesis.\nNow, what's really\ninteresting is we went back\nand we took wheat and added\nfree leucine to it to match\nthe leucine content of whey and\nthe protein synthetic response\nwas identical.\nSo again, I don't like to\nsimplify things too much,\nbut leucine appears to\nreally be driving this ship.\nAnd I'll never forget, Layman\ncalled me into his office\none day, and he would always do\nthese thought experiments of--\nhe liked to think\nabout why something\noccurs the way it does.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nDangerous territory.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo he would say--\none day, I'll never\nforget, he said,\nLayne, why do you think the body\nevolved to just sense leucine\nfor muscle protein synthesis?\nAnd of course, I'm\nlike, I don't know, man.\nI just work here like.\nI'm just trying to get my PhD.\nAnd he said, well,\nthink about it.\nYou would want something that\nreally wasn't extensively\nmetabolized by\nthe gut and liver,\nbecause you would want to\nshow up in the blood in values\nthat reflect what you just ate.\nMakes sense.\nAnd you would want it to\nhave passive diffusion\nacross the muscle\ncell because you\nwant to be\nconcentration-dependent,\nwhich it is.\nSo--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Get into\nthe tissues and cells\nthat need it most.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nSo not having active transport,\nbut rather passive transport.\nSo yeah, I thought that\nwas really interesting\nthe way he broke that down.\nSo few different options for\nthe vegan folks out there.\nYou can use an isolated\nsource of protein.\nAnd again, like there's going\nto be good options coming,\nbecause this plant-based\nwhey is going\nto be a great option for folks.\nYou can add free leucine\nto it, to whatever\nyour source of protein is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Just by\nsupplemented leucine powder.\nLAYNE NORTON: Now,\nit tastes horrible.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI think I've heard that.\nMaybe I've even tried it.\nLAYNE NORTON: It's completely\nnon-polar, it does not not\ndissolve in anything\nAnd it is gross.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can it\nbe put into capsules?\nLAYNE NORTON: It can\nbe put in the capsules.\nYeah.\nSo you could take a capsule.\nLike for example, if you're\neating your normal meal,\nyou could just take a capsule\nof like 1 gram of leucine.\nIs probably going to bump\nyou up enough that you're\ngoing to be good to go.\nAnd then there's\noptions like blends--\nespecially, with corn.\nCorn is actually\nvery high in leucine.\nThat's a percentage\nof its protein.\nNow, you've got to remember\nlike, you go eat corn\non the cob and you're getting\nlike 2 grams of total protein.\nSo it's not that much leucine.\nBut if you isolate out the\nprotein, put it into a powder,\nwell, now, when you're getting\nlike 80%, 90% of the weight\nis now protein, corn\nis actually about 12%\nleucine in terms of the protein.\nSo a great source of leucine, it\nis like almost frank deficient\nin some other amino acids.\nBut you can blend it with a\nfew other sources of protein.\nLike you could blend\nit with a soy, a pea,\nand you can create these\ncomplementary blends\nthat would actually have\nquite a bit of leucine,\nbut also some of the other\nessential amino acids.\nSo there are options out\nthere for plant-based folks.\nAnd I mean, we have\nseen people who\nare plant-based build\nimpressive amounts of muscle.\nThere's quite a few bodybuilders\nthat are plant-based.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And a lot of\nthe endurance athletes like it.\nAnd even though-- when\nwe talk about muscle,\nwe think about muscle\nbuilding often.\nPerformance in endurance sports.\nAnd also just performance\nfor the typical person\nwho's doing some\ncardiovascular training,\nhopefully, some\nresistance training.\nAlso and just living life.\nI mean, many more\npeople now, it seems\nare vegan or at least avoiding\nmeat, in particular red meat.\nI'm not one of those people.\nI limit the amount,\nand I certainly\nfocus on the quality\nof what I eat.\nBut I do eat red\nmeat, which brings me\nto a question about just\ngenerally in terms of food\nchoice, can we come up with\na relatively short summary\nof the following?\nTell me if this\nis correct or not.\nThat most of us\nshould be focused on--\nfor sake of health\nspan and lifespan,\nshould be focused on ingesting\nminimally non-processed\nand minimally processed foods.\nMaybe even cooking our own food.\nI realize that's heresy now.\nBut ideally, we would\ndo some of that.\nAnd really trying to avoid\nfoods that are highly processed\nand have lots of sugar.\nAnd I'm using this as a\nsegue to get into a question\nthat I really want\nyour answer to.\nI've been dying to ask you this,\nwhich is if sugar intake is not\nactually going up as much as\npeople think it is, why are\npeople getting so much fatter?\nSo what do you think about\njust a general statement\nthat we should try and eat\nfoods that are low to no--\nminimally to not processed\nfor about 80% of our foods.\nIs that a reasonable number?\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nIt's hard to actually get\ncompletely unprocessed food\nbecause almost everything\ngoes through some form\nof processing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm\nthinking like anything\nthat wouldn't survive long\nwithout refrigeration--\nLAYNE NORTON: On shelf?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nOn a shelf, like an\napple or a banana.\nSo like oatmeal, like\nground oats to me\nas long as there isn't\na bunch of other stuff\nand they would be\nminimally processed.\nA steak is not really\nprocessed, although it's\ncut off the animal, et cetera.\nSo there's a few steps in there.\nBut that's what I mean.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: And I think\neverybody gets the gist.\nI'm probably a\nlittle bit pedantic\nwhen it comes to this stuff.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNo, this is good.\nActually, one of the\nthings I appreciate\nabout you is something that\nI get teased a lot by people\nclose to me, which is the\ncaveats and the insistence\non precision is really\nimportant because especially\nwith online\ncommunications these days,\nit's like a runaway train.\nPeople will--\nLAYNE NORTON: It's too\neasy to misinterpret\nwhat you're saying.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very\neasy to misinterpret it.\nAnd the misinterpretations\nare often\nused to leverage whole new ideas\nabout what is and isn't true.\nMostly about what is true.\nSo I really\nappreciate the nuance.\nAnd this is what a longform\npodcast really allows us to do,\nis catch every curve, you know?\nLAYNE NORTON: So I would 100%\nagree with what you said.\nThat if you were going to\nmake a broad stroke, that\ntrying to focus on\nminimally processed foods\nis very important.\nThe one caveat I would\nsay is, I think it's\nimportant to understand why.\nBecause otherwise, people can\nmake this weird association\nthat, if I eat any minimally--\nor any processed food,\nit's going to kill me.\nOr like every time\nI eat it, it's\nlike I'm smoking a\ncigarette and my health--\nmy longevity is declining.\nBased on the studies we have,\nit's mostly about the energy.\nThat processed food just gets\npeople to spontaneously eat\nmore.\nAnd Kevin Hall showed this\nin his study that was very--\nI mean, he designed some\nof the most elegant studies\nin nutrition.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's great.\nLAYNE NORTON: And they,\nbasically, took people\nfrom a minimally\nprocessed food diet,\nand then gave them access\nto ultra processed foods.\nVery few instructions.\nJust eat to you feel satisfied.\nAnd they spontaneously\nincreased their calorie intake\nby 500 calories a day.\nI mean, that's massive.\nAnd we haven't quite\nfigured it out.\nPeople say, well, it's sugar.\nIt doesn't appear to be sugar\nin terms of just an isolation.\nWell, it's fats.\nDoesn't appear to be\nfats in isolation.\nWell, it's the combination\nof sugar and fat.\nPartly, well, it's\nthe combination\nof sugar, fat and salt. Partly.\nBut there's some\nkind of overall magic\nto the texture and\nthe mouthfeel and just\nthe overall\npalatability of stuff.\nWhich is always\nwhy I say, there's\nlike right and wrong ways\nto these different diets.\nLike, for example, like there's\nthe right way to do plant-based\nand then there's like what's\nin some of these documentaries\nwhere they're eating like\nplant-based mac and cheese.\nAnd again, I love a\ngood mac and cheese,\nbut that should not form--\nthat should not be\npitched as a healthy diet.\njust because it's \"plant-based.\"\nBecause I mean, you're eating\na highly processed food\nthat's very palatable\nand easy to overeat.\nSame thing for keto.\nYou've now got like\nketo ice creams\nand you've got keto cookies\nand all these sorts of things.\nAnd I'm like, yeah, and\nif you look at them,\nthey actually have more\ncalories than the normal stuff.\nAnd I'm like, yeah,\nthis is completely\nmissing the point here.\nLike you're actually\njust taking yourself--\nthe whole point of those\ndiets is the reason\nyou tend to lose\nweight is originally\nlike good luck 10\nyears ago, doing a keto\ndiet, eating processed food.\nLike you just couldn't\ndo it, really.\nNow, you can.\nBut the problem\nis, it's not going\nto work because you're\ngoing to be still consuming\ntoo many calories, because\neven though it's keto,\nwhat are they doing?\nWell, they're trying to\nmake it more palatable,\nthey're trying to make\nit better mouthfeel,\nwhich, I guess, if you're being\nketo for the sake of being\nketo, great, but if you have\nhopes of body composition\nmodification, it's going to\nreally negatively impact.\nSo yes, I think minimizing\nthe amount of processed foods\nyou consume can be important.\nNow that being said, it\ndepends on the individual\nand their goals.\nIf your goal is to, for example,\nbuild muscle or maintain a high\nbody weight for a\nsport, for example,\nlike an NFL offensive lineman\nor something of that nature,\nor if you're--\nI worked with an NBA\nteam, they were kind of--\nI can't disclose anything,\nbut they were looking\nat drafting a certain player.\nAnd like for them, processed\nfoods may actually be a tool.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or a teenagers.\nWe all want young people to\neat more healthily, I think.\nDevelop great habits.\nBut some of them, their\ncaloric needs are so high--\nLAYNE NORTON: So high.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --that if\nthey were eating what I eat,\nthey're going to dissolve into--\nthey'll just waste away.\nLAYNE NORTON: So I\ndescribe this, again,\nwith a financial example.\nIt's like a budget.\nSo if I make a million\ndollars a year,\nfor example, is it OK for me to\nbuy like a $100,000 sports car?\nLet's assume that\nloans don't exist.\nIs it OK for me to buy\na $100,000 sports car\nif I still am able to pay my\nmortgage and pay my utilities\nand take care of my\nresponsibilities--\nthe things I should do.\nIs OK if I do that if it makes\nme feel good and it's fun?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK by me.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nIt's fun.\nLike it fits in your budget.\nIf I make 50 grand\na year, should I\nbe going out and\nbuying a sports car?\nProbably not,\nbecause I'm not going\nto be able to pay\nmy mortgage and all\nthese other responsibilities.\nSo your protein, your,\nfiber your micronutrients.\nThese are your responsibilities.\nBut those become\nmuch easier to hit\nwhen you have higher calories.\nSo if you're eating\n4,000 calories a day\nfor whatever goal you\nhave, you're probably\ngoing to have some left\nover and like good luck\neating 4,000 calories from\nminimally processed foods,\nquite frankly,\nyou'll be miserable\nbecause you're going\nto have such gut feel\nthat you're going to feel\nlike you can't even move.\nAnd so again, now,\nit becomes OK,\nwell, is there something\ninherent to that food\nprocessing?\nIs there something\nthat we can pick out\nthat we know, OK,\nwell, this is going\nto be a negative\neffect on health,\neven like body\ncomposition stuff aside.\nAnd I would say,\nthere's not really\ngreat evidence of that so far.\nAnd a great example\nof that is sugar.\nI mean, I actually just\nwrote a really long article\non my website about why I\nthink sugar was not the root\ncause of the obesity epidemic.\nAnd you mentioned sugar\nintake in the last 20 years\nhas actually gone\ndown a little bit.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Alcohol intake,\nwell, if you look on the whole\nit, might have gone\nup a little bit,\nbut certain certainly\nin the male sector,\nit's gone way down drinking.\nUsed to be-- there\nwas a 5 o'clock.\nPeople were drinking all day.\nPeople are smoking a lot less.\nI think it's a real puzzle.\nI'd love to know what\nyour hypotheses are.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well,\nsmoking could actually\nbe in opposition because\nnicotine is actually\nan appetite suppressant.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Appetite\nsuppressant and also increases\nfocus.\nThe problem is it often\narrives in a delivery\ndevice that can kill you.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But nicotine\nitself is a powerful agent.\nIt also can offset age-related\ncognitive decline not entirely,\nbut it makes the\nbrain work better.\nLAYNE NORTON: I've got a buddy\nwho doesn't like caffeine.\nAnd he just takes those\nnicotine pouches and, basically,\nhas one in almost\nall day because he's\nlike-- he has a very stressful\njob and he's a high performer.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nYou have to be careful\nhow you deliver it,\nbut there's a Nobel Prize\nwinning neuroscientist that\nwill chew five or six\npieces of Nicorette an hour,\nwhich I do not recommend,\nbut when he quit smoking,\nhe just simply couldn't\nfunction as well.\nAnd he was the\none who pointed me\nto do the literature\non offsetting\nage-related cognitive decline.\nEven neuron maintenance,\nand it's pretty interesting.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well, it's a\npretty impressive nootropic\nto be honest.\nNow, the first\nthing to realize is\nwhen we're talking\nabout consumption data,\nthis is based on actual\nproduction, basically.\nThey're assuming that,\nOK, we're producing\nthis amount of\nthese foods, so we\ncan assume the consumption\nis going to follow that.\nSo it's not a\ndirect measurement.\nBut it has been validated\nin a few different studies.\nWe know that oil\nconsumption has gone up.\nLike that that's, yeah.\nThat's one of the big ones.\nAnd this forms the\ncrux of-- like,\nthe seed oils are\nlike the root of--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\ndefinitely the question\nthat I'm going to ping you on.\nLAYNE NORTON: They're going\nto come into your house\nand kick your dog and punch your\nmom, and all kinds of stuff.\nAnd I'm happy to address those.\nSo calories have still gone up.\nThere's some people\nwho claim that they've\ngone-- they've plateaued.\nI think the data seems to\nsuggest that calorie intake is\nstill increasing.\nAnd the other thing\nto keep in mind\nis, even if it's\nplateaued, it's still\nat a high enough level\nthat obesity is probably\ngoing to continue to\nincrease up to a point\nwhere it'll probably plateau\nif calories have plateaued.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nabout energy output?\nLeaving aside NEAT, because\nthat sounds highly individual,\nI mean, people are--\nthe people we know are\nfocusing on exercise.\nBut there are a lot of folks\nout there that don't exercise.\nLAYNE NORTON: And energy output\nhas gone down over the years.\nI mean, it's very\nobvious when you\nlook at how people\nwork now compared\nto even 30, 40 years ago.\nIt's much different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Less walking.\nAlso, I learned recently\nthat kids in high school\ndon't take PE class\nin many schools.\nBut we had to suit up\nand run and suit up.\nAnd if you didn't bring\nyour change of clothes\nor you didn't wash them in\nwhich case you'd be better off\njust not wearing them, nothing\nlike the smell of a boys locker\nroom after a weekend,\nI can still remember it\nand it's not pleasant.\nBut you had to run and do your\npushups with everybody else\nor play volleyball in your\nregular school day clothes.\nSo my understanding is that,\nphysical education is not\npart of the basic\neducation any longer.\nLAYNE NORTON: It probably\ndepends on the state,\nbut I know many states have\ndone away with it just because\nof budget cuts.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nactivity is going down,\ncaloric intake is going up.\nMaybe--\nLAYNE NORTON: Plateauing\na little bit, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--maybe plateauing.\nIs that sufficient to\nexplain the obesity epidemic?\nLAYNE NORTON: Based\non what I've seen,\nI think it's pretty sufficient.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So it\nmight not be that big\nof a mystery after all?\nLAYNE NORTON: No, I don't\nthink it's a big mystery.\nI think that people don't like\nthe concept of energy balance,\nand I think because\nthey insert judgment\ninto it, which is, OK, if\nyou're gaining weight over time,\nat a fundamental level,\nit means you are eating--\nyou're consuming more energy\nthan you're expending.\nPeople insert the judgment,\nwhich is, you're lazy,\nyou're a sloth,\nor whatever it is.\nAnd I think there's a\nlot of people out there\nwho actually think\nthat, I actually\nremember talking to\nsomebody who was like, well,\nI would never hire an\nobese person for a job\nbecause it's just obvious\nthat they're lazy.\nAnd I just remember\ngoing, are you serious?\nLike, there are\nplenty of very, very\nsmart high-achieving\npeople who are obese.\nAnd like it's not--\nthis is what happens when you\njust put people in buckets.\nPeople are much more\ncomplicated than this.\nYes.\nThere is some personal\nresponsibility.\nBut then when you look through\nthe data and you take--\nthere was a study\ndone in obese women\nwhere they found that\nwomen who were obese\nwere 50% more likely to have\nhad some form of sexual assault\ntrauma in their past.\nWe know that people\nfrom lower income areas\nare more prone to be obese.\nThere's several people who have\na higher ACE score, I believe,\nwhich of measures like\ntraumatic childhood events.\nI believe, there was a\nstudy showing they're\nmore likely to be obese.\nSo there's-- yes, it is an\nenergy imbalance problem,\nbut just saying,\neat less, move more,\nthat's like telling\nbroke people, well,\njust earn more money\nthan you spend.\nIt's technically right,\nbut it's very unhelpful.\nWhat is more helpful is\nto describe and implement\nthe habits and\nbehaviors that will\nallow them to achieve that.\nSo I realized we go\noff track a little bit,\nbut circling back to\nsugar, circa 2005,\nI believe that sugar\nwas fattening and bad\nfor your health independent\nof any other variable.\nSo independent risk factor.\nAnd again, I want to be very\nclear about what independent\nmeans.\nIndependent means independent\nof all of the variables.\nThis thing is bad for your\nhealth and body composition.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So on its own,\nindependent of whether or not,\nfor instance, it increases\nhunger and appetite.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nOr caloric intake.\nI was at a graduate\nschool mixer.\nAnd one of the\nprofessors there was\nsomebody who had done\nresearch on high fructose corn\nsyrup and fructose,\nspecifically, as well.\nAnd he was talking\nto another professor\nand he had done this study in\nrodents where he had fed like--\nI think it was like 60%\nor 70% of their calories\nfrom fructose.\nAnd they saw some\nreally weird things\nhappen in the liver\nwith lipogenesis\nand all this kind of stuff.\nAnd the other professor\nis saying to him, yeah,\nit's pretty obvious\nthat high fructose corn\nsyrup is fattening.\nAnd this professor who\nhad done this research\nsaid, yeah, because\nit's people overeat.\nAnd he's like, don't\nyou think there's\nsomething inherent to it?\nAnd he said, no, I think\nit's just calories.\nPeople are eating\ntoo many calories.\nHe's like, we did a proof of\nconcept looking at could we--\nlike, try eating 70% of your\ndaily calories from fructose.\nYou actually can't do it.\nHigh fructose, corn syrup\nis only 55% fructose.\nSo if you ate nothing but\nhigh fructose, corn syrup,\nyou would still not\nget to this level\nthat they fed in this study.\nSo that got me kind of\nlike questioning my beliefs\nabout it.\nSo then I went through and I\nsaid, OK, look, let's take out\nthe epidemiology.\nNot that epidemiology\nis useless,\nbut people who eat\nmore sugar are also\nlikely to eat more calories.\nSo then I looked for the\nrandomized controlled trials\nwhere they match calories\nand vary the amount of sugar.\nAnd it doesn't seem\nto make a difference.\nAt least from fat\nloss or fat gain--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nwhat about health?\nSo for instance, if somebody--\nand I know somebody like this\nwho loves sweets, is thin,\nget some exercise, not a ton.\nBut my concern is that,\na significant fraction\nof their calories are coming\nfrom these sugary foods\nand therefore they're not\ngetting enough fiber--\nmaybe protein, et cetera.\nLAYNE NORTON: So let's look\nat epidemiology for a second,\nthen I'll address\nthis more directly.\nWhen we look at\nepidemiology, people\nwho eat higher amounts of\nsugar tend to be more obese,\nthey tend to have worse\nbiomarkers of health.\nThe people who eat fruit--\na lot of fruit sugar,\ndon't have those\nsame associations.\nSo why is that?\nWell, because fruit\nhas fiber with it.\nSo I started to believe,\nbased on the data\nI was looking at, that\nhigh sugar intake was not\nthe problem per se.\nThe problem was that high\nsugary foods, typically,\nare very low in fiber.\nBut if you're getting enough\nfiber, is sugar a problem?\nSo there was a classic\nstudy by Surwit in 1997.\nI think it's still\nthe best studies\nof this day looking at this.\nAnd I know those people who\nsay, well, it was done in 1997.\nIt has no relevance.\nYou know, I know, if it's a\ngood study, it's a good study.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Some\nstudies are timeless.\nIn fact, they have\ngreater relevance--\nLAYNE NORTON: You're not\ngoing to go back and undo\nthe discovery of DNA\nbecause it was 60 years ago\nor whatever it is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nLAYNE NORTON: So they looked\nat an 1,100-calorie diet,\nso low calorie diet.\nOne group was eating over\n110 grams of sugar a day,\nlike sucrose.\nThe other group was eating\nabout 10 grams of sugar per day.\nCalories, protein,\ncarbs, fats all matched.\nAnd they provided all the\nmeals to these participants.\nSo very tightly controlled.\nAnd it was over six weeks.\nBoth groups lost the exact\nsame amount of body fat.\nSo it doesn't seem to matter\nfor body composition in terms\nof sugar per se.\nThen they also looked at\nsome biomarkers of health\nlike blood lipids and blood\nsugar and some other things.\nAgain, there was no\nreal differences.\nThe only difference was--\nso all their biomarkers\nimproved in both groups.\nThe only real difference was\na small difference in LDL.\nSo the group eating low sugar\nhad a better improvement\nslightly in LDL.\nBut that's probably because\nthey were eating more fiber.\nAnd we know fiber can bind\nto cholesterol and lower LDL\ncholesterol.\nSo now, I want to caveat this.\nSugar probably doesn't have\nany positive health effects.\nSo there's that.\nAnd nutrition is an exchange.\nIf you're eating one\nthing, you're not\neating another thing, right?\nSo but what I would\ntell people is,\nfocus probably less on\nsugar, focus more on fiber.\nSo if you're eating 30, 40,\n50, 60 grams of fiber a day,\nbut your sugar is,\n80, 90 grams, I\nwould not be that\nworried about it,\nespecially, if you're\ncontrolling calories as well.\nWhat I would be worried\nabout is if you're\neating just a decent\namount of calories\nand not getting enough\nfiber and in general, right?\nAnd even in studies,\nthere's a few meta\nanalyzes out now looking\nat isoenergetic exchange\nof different carbohydrates\nwith sugar carbohydrates.\nSo fructose and\nglucose and sucrose.\nNow, why is this important?\nWell, again, if\nyou're not equate--\nwhen I say isoenergetic,\nthat means equal in energy,\nequal in calories.\nSo basically, when they exchange\neither sucrose or glucose\nor fructose for other\nforms of carbohydrate,\ndo they see differences in\nthese markers of health?\nLike HbA1c, fasting blood\nglucose, blood lipids,\nwith rare exceptions, and I\ncan't remember all the data\npoints exactly.\nBut the take home\nis, doesn't really\nseem to make a difference?\nNow, for anybody out there,\nstraw man is my argument,\nI am not advocating\nfor sugar consumption.\nBut I think it's\nimportant for people\nto not create weird\nassociations in their minds\nbecause one of the things\nI've observed, especially,\nin the fitness industry,\nis when people feel\nlike they can't eat something--\nit's one thing if you say, I\nam choosing not to eat this\njust because I'm choosing to.\nBut it's a very different\nthing when you're purposely\nrestricting because you\nfeel like something is bad.\nAnd this-- I mean, you\nknow the human brain is,\nin many ways, amazing and\nin many ways, really dumb.\nSo when you purposely try\nto restrict something,\nwhat tends to happen is you're\nmore prone to binge on it.\nSo people who will\ntry to-- well,\nI'm never going to eat\nyou know sugar again\nor I'm going to try\nand limit sugar.\nAnd this isn't the\ncase for everybody.\nBut they have actually\nshown now in studies, people\nwho are purposely restricting\na specific nutrient,\nthey tend to crave\nmore of that nutrient.\nAnd if they do get exposed to\nit, they're more likely to have\nwhat's called a disinhibition\nreflex, which is basically\na binge response.\nBecause the thinking\ngoes, well, this is bad,\nand there's no context on\ndosage making the poison.\nThis is just bad in general.\nSo if I have it, I've\nalready screwed up.\nI might as well just\nhave as much as I want.\nAnd I like Spencer Nadolsky's\ncomparison to this.\nThat's like getting a flat and\nthen going out and slashing\nyour other three tires\nbecause you might as well.\nSo I really--\nI try to come from that\nperspective of, I've\nseen so many people\nstruggle with, maybe,\nnot an eating disorder, but\ndisordered eating patterns\nbecause of these associations\nthey've made in their mind.\nAnd so that's why I'm so\npedantic and a stickler\nabout saying, OK,\nyes, it's a good idea\nto eat mentally\nprocessed food and try\nto avoid processed foods.\nBut not because processed\nfoods are bad per se,\nbut what the outcome tends to\nbe from a lot of processed food\nconsumption, which is\noverconsuming calories and then\ntherefore energy toxicity\nnegatively contributing\nto your health.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nIt seems like it, again,\nreturns to the potential\nfor a positive, negative, or\nneutral behavioral change.\nAnd perceptual change\nof like craving of food\nall the time that you\ncan have is terrible.\nThat's a terrible\nstate to be in.\nAnd this, I think, is a\nperfect segue way for something\nthat first brought\nus together, which\nwas this thing about\nartificial sweeteners.\nAnd let me just, for the\nrecord, be very clear.\nI have long ingested foods\nwith artificial sweeteners.\nSo throughout graduate school,\nI didn't have the best habits.\nThey're healthier now\nthan they were back then.\nBut I would drink a Diet\nCoke or two per day.\nI still have the\noccasional Diet Coke,\nI'm not completely\naverse to drink something\nthat has artificial sweetener.\nAlthough, I do avoid\nsucralose for reasons\nthat maybe I can get\ninto a little bit later.\nBut a lot of the\nthings I consume\ncontain stevia, which\nis not artificial\nbut it is a plant-based\nnon-caloric-- or low caloric\nsweetener.\nAnd I don't have a\nproblem with that.\nI became very interested in\nartificial sweeteners because\nof the animal data\npointing to the idea\nthat they may disrupt\nthe gut microbiome,\nand then disrupt the gut\nmicrobiome, as you pointed out,\nis a very broad statement.\nWe don't really\nknow the percentage\nof lactobacillus, exobacilius,\nor whatever ilius in there--\nthey all seem to end in ilius--\nis ideal.\nAnd in fact, a lot\nof these companies\nthat are having people\nsend in their stool samples\nfor analysis of the microbiome.\nI mean, take note,\nwe don't really\nknow what a healthy\nmicrobiome looks like,\nbut we know what an unhealthy\nmicrobiome might look like.\nAnd it's one that doesn't have\na lot of diversity in there.\nSo I was interested\nin that, then\nthere's the recent human study\nwhich we should definitely\nget into.\nBut I was mostly interested\nin artificial sweeteners\nfor the reason that there is\nthis food conditioning effect.\nAnd you see it in\nanimals and you see it\nin humans that if you ingest--\nwell, coffee is a\nreally good example.\nCoffee doesn't actually\ntaste good folks,\neven though I like it.\nBut when you taste coffee\nfor the first time,\nmost people think it's\nbitter and disgusting.\nMost, everybody,\nlike 95% of people\nsay, this doesn't taste good.\nLAYNE NORTON: Wine,\nbeer are same thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nBut people have learned to\nassociate the state of being\ncaffeinated, which most\npeople like in order\nto just feel normal,\nright, caffeine\nis one of the few drugs we\ningest just to feel ourselves\nenough that soon--\nmyself included,\nreally look forward to\nand enjoy a cup of coffee.\nSo it's a powerful\nexample, in my opinion,\nof the food conditioning effect.\nSo it's like a Pavlovian thing.\nInstead of\nsalivating, you crave.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it did\nseem that this study from Dana\nSmall's lab, which admittedly\nwas a small no pun intended\nstudy itself, not\nvery many subjects,\nshowed that if you ingested\nartificial sweeteners along\nwith food that contained\nglucose, that you could maybe\neven get a heightened\nglucose response just\nfrom the artificial\nsweeteners after a while.\nYou and I connected over\nthis study on social media.\nYou pointed out that the\ndesign, the study wasn't superb.\nThere was co-consumption\nof glucose,\nwhich made it complicated.\nWe can go into that.\nBut the reason I'm spouting\noff all this context\nis, artificial sweeteners\nare many things.\nSo I'd like to talk\nabout their effects\non blood sugar in\nthe acute sense\nand according to what we\nmight ingest them with\nand how they might be\nchanging blood sugar\nregulation at the level\nof brain and/or body.\nAnd then the gut\nmicrobiome data, I think,\nare interesting\nenough to discuss.\nAnd I have changed my view\non artificial sweeteners\nbased on what you've taught me.\nSo this is a case\nwhere I've completely\nchanged my view,\nwhich is that, now, I\ndon't have any problem\nwith them whatsoever based\non the current data, which is\nnot to say that I'm gulping\ndown cup fulls of sucralose,\nbut I feel OK ingesting\nsome stevia and some aspartame\nand I'm not too worried\nabout it.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nSo I think stepping\nback from a broad view,\nwe have to think about, again,\nthe hierarchy of importance.\nAnd what are you replacing with?\nSo there is no situation\nwhere it is not a net positive\nto take somebody who drinks\nsugar sweetened beverages\nand have them drink\nan artificially\nsweetened beverage.\nIn the meta analysis, there was\nactually a recent network meta\nanalysis looking at markers\nof adiposity, HbA1c,\na bunch of different\nhealth markers,\nand when you substitute,\nwe'll call it\nnon-nutritive sweeteners,\nand stevia is not artificial.\nBut so when you substitute\nNNS for the sugar-sweetened\nbeverages, you see improvements\nin a lot of different things.\nWhat was really interesting\nabout this network meta\nanalysis was they also\nlooked at water substitution\nin place of\nsugar-sweetened beverages.\nAnd the effect wasn't\nas powerful as--\nand these are randomized\ncontrolled trials.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So artificial\nsweetener containing beverages\nare more beneficial--\nLAYNE NORTON: Were\nbetter for adiposity--\nfor improving adiposity, and\nthen in the health markers,\nit was kind of a wash.\nWater and non-nutritive\nsweetener, beverages\nperformed similar.\nBut there were better than\nsugar-sweetened beverages,\nobviously.\nSo they then based on--\na network meta\nanalysis is where you\ncan compare to things that\ndidn't get compared directly.\nSo there's not many studies\ncomparing NNS versus water\ndirectly.\nBut if you have a\ncommon comparator,\nso if you compare A to B\nand B gets compared to C,\nyou compare A to C based on\nhow they interacted with B.\nButchering it a\nlittle, bit but that's\nthe crux of a network\nmeta analysis.\nSo they looked at\nNNS versus water\nand found that actually,\nin NNS was slightly\nbetter for improving adiposity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: NNS, of course,\nbeing non-nutritive sweeteners.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: So now, again,\nif you like drinking water\nand you don't want to--\nI'm not trying to convince\nanybody to do that.\nWhat that seems to\nsuggest is there\nis a little bit of an\nappetite suppressant\neffect from these\nartificial sweeteners\nor non-nutritive sweeteners.\nNow, this gets a little\nbit more complicated\nbecause if these\nwere people drinking\nsugar-sweetened beverages,\nmaybe they've already\ndeveloped a sweet taste\nand try to go to water,\nit's too much of\na jump for them.\nAnd so going to having\nsomething like intermediate\nis a little bit better.\nLike, there's a lot\nwrapped up in this.\nBut these are the randomized\ncontrolled trials,\nwhich are a little bit more\ntightly controlled, which\nI tend to default\nto a little bit more\nthan I do the epidemiology,\nwhich epidemiology is just\nso messy, because sure,\nnon-nutritive sweetener\nconsumption may be associated\nwith different things,\nbut there's also a whole other\nset of lifestyle and habits\nthat are tied up in that.\nSo I tend to hang my\nhat a little bit more\non the randomized\ncontrolled trials.\nSo understanding that.\nOK.\nNow, all things being\nequal, understanding\nthat this is a tool that\nmay help some people,\nand whenever I post about\nnon-nutritive sweeteners\nin the comments, there's\nalways one or two or three\npeople who say, all I\ndid was cut out soda.\nAnd I drank diet soda\ninstead, and I lost 50 pounds.\nOr I lost 75 pounds.\nI even had 1%.\nI lost 100 pounds.\nThat's the only thing I did.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nLAYNE NORTON: I mean, that's a\npretty massive lever to pull.\nIf you consider somebody who\nmight be having like, I mean,\nfive or six Cokes a\nday, I mean, we're\ntalking a serious\namount of calories.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd that also means\nthat by replacing it with\nartificial sweetener-containing\nbeverages, they did not\nreplace the soda with food.\nLAYNE NORTON: Correct.\nSo now, let's talk about, right?\nThis is where we can get\ninto the micro analysis,\nbut is that obese person who\nlost 100 pounds by doing that?\nDo I really care about,\nmaybe, a small alteration\nto their gut microbiome?\nNo, because their gut microbiome\nis actually much more healthy\nnow by them having lost all\nthat excess adipose tissue.\nSo again, the ranking of\nwhat I'm worried about\ncan change depending on\nthe specific situation.\nNow, let's take somebody like\nme who's lean and doesn't really\nhave any health problems\nthat I'm aware of.\nWhat about artificial\nsweeteners for me?\nWell, for me, I got using them\nbecause of bodybuilding contest\nprep, because it was\nabout the only appetite\nsuppressant that worked for me.\nBut do I think that\nthey are healthful?\nProbably not.\nDo I think they're unhealthy?\nI would say based\non the current data,\nI don't think that\nthey're unhealthy.\nNow, the information\non blood glucose.\nSo there's-- some of the\nproblems with some of these\nmeta analyzes or these\nreviews is they lump all\nthe non-nutritive sweeteners\ntogether and then they may say,\nwell, there's no effect on this\nor there's an effect on this.\nWell, the problem is these\nare different molecules\nand they can\ninteract differently.\nAspartame, very clearly,\nseems to have no effect\non blood sugar or insulin.\nThat has been repeatedly shown.\nStevia doesn't appear\nto have much effect.\nSaccharin and sucralose,\nthe jury is mixed.\nNow, there was the\nstudy that we first\nconnected on which, I\nthink, their primary outcome\nmeasure was actually they were\nlooking at the sweet taste.\nLike how it affected\nsweet taste.\nSo what they did was, the group\nthat was getting the sucralose\nwas also paired\nwith maltodextrin.\nThe control group\nwas getting sucrose,\nwhich is an appropriate\nway to compare\nthe sweet taste because\nmaltodextrin is not\nas sweet as sucrose.\nSo when you're trying to\ncombine sucralose, which\nis already sweet, with\nanother form of carbohydrate,\nyou'd want something less\nsweet compared to your control.\nBut for the outcome measure\nof insulin and blood glucose,\nprobably, not as\nappropriate because we know\nmaltodextrin has a much higher\nglycemic index than sucrose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So they\nappropriately controlled\nfor taste, but not for the\neffect of the sweeteners.\nAnd I think that that\nwas a key component.\nAnd I think, yeah, the\npart of that study that\nintrigued me actually was\nin a talk version of that\nbecause that study drove\nme to watch a talk that--\nand we'll get Dana Small on\nthe podcast at some point,\nhopefully-- was that they\nhad kids do this study.\nAnd they actually had\nto cease the study\nbecause a couple of the\nkids became prediabetic.\nI mean, it seemed like there\nwas something hazardous about--\nthis was the Yale\nSchool of Medicine.\nIt's a good place.\nI mean, there's a\nrange everywhere.\nBut it just seemed like there's\nsomething about sweet taste\nthat if taken to\nthe extreme might\nbe able to impact blood sugar.\nThis has impacted my behavior.\nAnd I try to avoid really\nsweet things, unless they're\nexceptionally delicious or\nthe occasion calls for them\nbecause I do think\nthat it increases\nmy craving for sweet things.\nLAYNE NORTON: Well, it might\nnot be necessarily a craving,\nbut it just programs you.\nYour taste buds are\nextremely adaptable.\nSo take, for\nexample, Indian food.\nIf you bring Indian\npeople over to America\nand have them eat\nsome of our food,\nthey think it tastes extremely\nbland because they're\nused to such spicy\nfood that unless they\nhave a certain level of spice,\nthey can hardly even taste it.\nIf you've ever done\na high-sodium diet\nand then gone to a low-sodium\ndiet, it feels very bland.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\nwhere I started from.\nLAYNE NORTON: But over time,\nyour taste buds adjust.\nSo sweet is the same thing.\nIf you're used to\neating a lot of sweet,\nyou get desensitized to it.\nAnd then if you go to\nsomething less sweet,\nit can taste-bland at first.\nOver time, it'll get better.\nSo I think it's\none of those things\nthat, again, it depends\non the situation.\nIf somebody's obese\nand they said, well,\nthis is going to\nhelp me eliminate\nsugar-sweetened\nbeverage, why would you\nwant to take that\ntool away from them?\nThat's a great lever to pull.\nI mean, if somebody can\nlose literally 100 pounds\nfrom just one change in\nlifestyle that's not even\nreally that inconvenient of\na change, that is powerful.\nBut again, is it the most\nhealthy thing they could do?\nAnd I think that's what\ntends to get asked.\nWe don't know.\nIs it healthier than water?\nProbably not maybe\nas healthy as it.\nWho knows?\nBut I really make\nall those caveats\nbecause you don't want to\nhave people who could use this\nas a tool to think, well, no,\nI can't do this because it's\nactually bad for me.\nIf it helps you lose\n50 pounds or 75 pounds\nor whatever it is, trust me,\nit's not bad for you, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, it does seem\nto increase your\nsatiety signals.\nWhat do you think about\nthe microbiome effects\nin this recent study?\nBecause the recent\nstudy, I think,\nhad some nice features to it.\nAnd you've done a detailed\ndescription of the study.\nSo for those that want that--\nLAYNE NORTON: Is this the\ntwo-week study or the 10-week?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nthe two-week study.\nYeah.\nAnd we will provide a link.\nYou did an excellent video\non your YouTube channel\nthat really parses each piece.\nBut they compared the\nvarious artificial sweeteners\nand looked at the glucose\nresponse, looked at microbiome,\na number of different measures.\nWhat was your general takeaway?\nAnd this was in\nhumans for, I think,\nthe first time looking\nat microbiome in humans\ndue to artificial sweetener--\nLAYNE NORTON: There\nare a few studies\non the microbiome in humans\nwith artificial sweeteners.\nThe first two that came out\nshowed pretty much no effect,\nbut they were a little\nbit shorter in duration.\nThey were two to four weeks.\nAnd again, it depends on what\nbacteria are getting measured.\nThere's many different\nkinds of bacteria,\nso they could just be measuring\none that didn't change.\nAnd then there was a\n10-week study that came out\nthat got a lot of press.\nAnd they showed--\nI think it was sucralose.\nI think.\nThey showed an effect of\nchange on the gut microbiome.\nNow, what was\ninteresting is when\nI went into the\nspecies that changed,\nthe species that changed the\nmost compared to the control\nwas a species called--\nI'm going to butcher\nthe name, but it's\nlike Blautia coccoides,\nI think it's called.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nmust say for those\nthat work on the microbiome,\nit's so difficult to pronounce.\nI mean, you need a\nnomenclature committee,\nand you need acronyms.\nI'm sorry.\nJust do it.\nLAYNE NORTON: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Enough already.\nYou're killing us.\nLAYNE NORTON: We'll call it BC.\nWe call it BC.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: BC, thank you.\nWe're going to start the\nnomenclature committee\nwithout you if you\ndon't do it soon.\nLAYNE NORTON: So they noticed\nthat this went up by, like,\nthree- to four-fold.\nSo I kind of went down\nthe rabbit hole on this.\nSo interestingly, that\nparticular species of bacteria\nis actually associated with\nlower adiposity, better insulin\nsensitivity.\nAnd people who are obese\nand children who are obese\ntend to have less of it.\nSo I said, well,\nbased on that study,\nyou can actually argue that\nmaybe sucralose actually\nimproves the gut microbiome.\nNow, again, I'm not\nmaking that claim.\nBecause we have a hard\ntime understanding\nwhat a healthy microbiome\nlooks like already.\nThis last study that came out,\nmy biggest take-home was I\nthink it's safe to say that\nsome of these non-nutritive\nsweeteners are not\nmetabolically inert.\nThere are some effects.\nNow, are those effects\ngood, bad, or neutral\nI think has yet to\nbe fully elucidated.\nNow, I focused more on the\nblood-glucose responses\nin my analysis.\nSo in that 10-week study, they\ndid oral-glucose tolerance\ntest.\nAnd their conclusion I\ndidn't really feel like\nfit their data.\nSo their conclusion\nwas that-- and again,\nI think it was sucralose--\nthat it elevated blood glucose.\n[SIGHS] And this\nis where statistics\ncan get kind of tricky.\nSo my take-home was the\narea under the curve,\nthe incremental area\nunder the curve, which\nis looking at basically\nthe entire glucose\nresponse, was not different\nbetween the control\nand the sucralose group.\nTo me, that's the\nbiggest take-home.\nThere was one time\npoint at the end\nof the study in the sucralose\ngroup, the 30-minute time\npoint, that was statistically\nsignificantly higher blood\nglucose than the control group.\nIt's kind of one of\nthose things where I\ngo, OK, it was one time point.\nIt's statistically significant.\nBut even then, we've seen\nthings be statistically\nsignificant that end\nup being data artifacts\nbecause they're not reproduced.\nSo I'm not saying that's\nwhat's happening here.\nBut again, the overall\narea under the curve\nwas not different.\nSo to me, that was\nthe biggest take-home.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And papers,\nwe should probably mention,\nare published because\nof effects, generally.\n[CHUCKLES] Lack of\neffect, harder to publish.\nLAYNE NORTON: Null\nhypothesis doesn't--\nit's actually really unfortunate\nbecause a null hypothesis\nis just as useful data as\nthe non-null hypothesis.\nBut you're right.\nThere is a very strong\npublication bias\ntowards showing an\neffect versus not.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, unless you\ncan flip a field on its head\nentirely by showing something\ndid not happen, typically\nthe positive result out\ndoes the negative\nresult, positive meaning\nyou see a result. And then\nof course, it's one study.\nAnd--\nLAYNE NORTON: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --I think that,\nas you talked about earlier,\nthe center of mass of\ndata in a given field\nare probably the best basis for\nwhat we should do in terms of--\nand so I'm not changing my\nbehavior around the intake\nof artificial sweeteners.\nI personally am still going to\nconsume stevia and aspartame\nin relatively small amounts.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nnow I'm thinking, well,\nOK, if something\ncontains sucralose,\nI don't have to perhaps\nactively avoid it.\nWhereas before I was.\nI was actively avoiding it.\nLAYNE NORTON: So the\nnew study I thought\nwas very elegantly--\nvery involved.\nI mean, to be quite\nfrank, some of the animal\nstuff they did was\nextremely impressive.\nSo there was actually\ntwo arms to the study.\nOne was the human arm.\nOne was the animal arm.\nI focused much more on\nthe human side of it.\nSo basically, this\nwas a two-week study.\nAnd the really unique aspect\nof this, which I think\nis both a strength\nand a weakness,\nthey had almost 1,400\npeople apply for this study.\nAnd they only had 120, I think,\nthat actually went into it.\nBecause they did a very detailed\nfood analysis of these folks.\nAll of these people\nsaid that they\navoided artificial sweeteners\nor didn't consume them.\nAnd I think people don't realize\nhow ubiquitous sweeteners are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nPrior to the study,\nthese people were like--\nit was like jury selection.\nThey'd never--\nLAYNE NORTON: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nlike not ever hearing\nof the plaintiff\nand the defendant.\nThese are these mutant\npeople who have never\nhad an artificial sweetener.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right,\nso the strength is now\nyou don't have a lot\nof preexisting effects\nthat may be clouding\nwhat would actually\nhappen when you add it in.\nFor example, if you have\npeople who are already\nconsuming artificial\nsweeteners and then you\nhave them consume\nartificial sweeteners,\nthe likelihood things are going\nto change is pretty low, right?\nSo I think that\nthat's a strength.\nIt's also a weakness.\nAnd I want to be really\ncareful because I\nthink people took my words\na little bit too far, which\nmeans I probably didn't do\na good job of being nuanced\nenough.\nThere is the possibility\nfor a placebo effect here.\nSo to me, if somebody has gone\nthrough that much painstaking\ncare to avoid\nartificial sweeteners,\nit's likely they have\na preconceived notion\nthat those are bad for\nyou, because they're\ndifficult to avoid.\nYes, it's possible if they're\neating a very minimally\nprocessed diet that they're\njust not exposed to them.\nAnd that's very true, as well.\nBut the other thing\nthat the researchers\nacknowledged was they weren't\nable to blind the study.\nBecause if you've never had an\nartificial sweetener before,\nyou're only used\nto regular sugar\nand you have an artificial\nsweetener, you know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You taste it.\nLAYNE NORTON: You know.\nIt's still sweet.\nBut it's not the same sweet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And there's\nan interesting effect there,\nwhere a lot of people don't\nlike the taste of aspartame\nthe first time.\nI actually quit drinking\ndiet soda for a while,\nthinking I should,\nand then had one.\nIt tasted really--\nI can only describe it as\nkind of artificial, chemical.\nAnd then pretty soon,\nit tasted great again.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And so there\nis some attenuation there.\nAnd whether or not\nthat's central,\nmeaning within the brain,\nor peripheral, I don't know.\nBut very interesting.\nWell, I see you as playing\na critical role in defining\nwhat is and what\nisn't, what still needs\nto be determined in\nterms of this landscape\nand the entire landscape\nreally of nutrition.\nLAYNE NORTON: And that study did\nchange my opinion in terms of,\nOK, I think we can clearly say\nnow that these aren't neutral.\nOr sorry, that they're\nnot inert, right?\nThat was the thought\nprocess before, was well.\nThey're not digested or\nwhatnot, so they must be inert.\nThat doesn't appear\nto be the case.\nBut again, when we look at the\nblood glucose data, there's--\nand I'm not saying\nthis is what happened.\nI want to be very clear.\nI'm not saying this\nis what happened.\nI'm saying it's\npossible this happened.\nAnd so this is why we need\nmore studies to verify.\nIf these people had\na preconceived notion\nthat artificial sweeteners\nwere bad for them,\nit's possible, knowing they're\ningesting artificial sweeteners\nthat they could have had\na blood glucose response.\nNow, my pushback on my\nown point there would be,\nthen we should have expected to\nsee it in all the non-nutritive\nsweeteners, which they didn't.\nIt was just in\nsucralose and saccharin.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, it was kind\nof a graded effect, where\nsucralose and saccharin showed\nthe most dramatic change.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And stevia and\na few of the others did not.\nLAYNE NORTON: And\nthe other issue\nI took with it-- maybe\nit's a ticky-tack thing--\nwas their primary\noutcome measure\nwas blood glucose, the\noral-glucose tolerance test.\nBut they had people administer\ntheir own oral-glucose\ntolerance tests, which\nbasically they gave them-- they\nsaid, OK, drink this drink.\nAnd they were wearing\ncontinuous glucose monitors,\nwhich should have been fine.\nBut again, to me--\nand I'm being ticky tacky.\nAnd again, I know all studies\nare limited by funding.\nSo I think overall,\nthis was a great study.\nBut I would have\nliked to have seen\nthem monitor the\noral-glucose tolerance\ntests to administer it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, and\nwhat they did before or after.\nYou want to know that\nthey didn't ingest this\nor did ingest that.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: Those two things.\nBut one other caveat is\nit was a two-week study.\nSo we've got to be really\ncareful how much we interpret\nin this because it's\nalso possible that this\nis a transient effect, right?\nAnd maybe it goes\naway over time.\nWe don't know.\nBut again, I think\nwe can clearly\nsay it's not inert, right?\nNow, how much emphasis we put\non that, on a two-week study,\nI still will say, OK,\nmaybe if you're worried,\ndon't consume sucralose.\nBut if you're 100\npounds overweight\nand you want to use some\nsucralose as a replacement\nto help you lose\nweight, I would say,\ndon't let this study\ndeter you from doing\nthat because the\nnet effect is still\ngoing to be more positive than\nyou not losing the weight,\nright?\nSo if it's a tool\nthat helps you, fine.\nBut I do hold open the\nidea that, well, there\ncould be negative\neffects from it, as well.\nBut again, we're looking at,\nwhat is the overall outcome?\nAnd then they examined some\nof the different things\nthat were increased with\nthese different sweeteners.\nAnd again, this word\ngets messy because one\nof the things they\nsaw was a big increase\nin butyrate production from the\nchange in the gut microbiome\npresumably.\nWell, as we discussed\nearlier, butyrate's\nactually associated\nwith positive outcomes\nin terms of insulin\nsensitivity, inflammation,\nand some other things.\nSo I want to be real cautious\nbefore people say, well,\nif there's a change\nin the microbiome,\nit must be a bad change.\nWe don't know.\nIt's possible.\nAnd again, if we have 10 more\nstudies come out and start\nto show this, then I will start\nto shift my personal opinion\nof artificial sweeteners.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo in anticipation\nof sitting down\ntoday, I did solicit\nfor questions on social media.\nAnd one of the questions\nthat got a lot of upvotes,\nlikes if you will,\nwas one that I think\nraises interesting questions\nabout short-term and long-term\nhealth.\nAnd it's the following.\nI think it's a common scenario.\nA number of people\nwant to know, what\nis the healthiest way to\napproach a rapid weight loss?\nAnd here what I\nthink is happening\nis somebody has\nan event coming up\nor they're just tired\nof being the weight they\nare, carrying the amount\nof adipose tissue they are.\nAnd they wanted to\nknow whether or not\nit is safe to,\nfor instance, lose\nthree pounds a week for a\nfew weeks in anticipation\nof a wedding or some other\nevent and whether or not\nstraight caloric restriction\nand increasing activity\nis the best way\nto approach that,\nwith the understanding that\nthey may gain back a little\nafterwards.\nI think ideally they'd like\nto maintain it afterwards.\nBut what do you think\nof that approach,\ncutting caloric intake\nin half, for instance,\nand then also doubling\nyour physical output?\nLAYNE NORTON: So\nit's interesting\nbecause you might\nbe surprised by what\nI'm going to say, which is the\nresearch data actually tends\nto suggest that\npeople who are obese,\nwho lose a lot\nmore weight early,\nare more likely to\nkeep it off, which\nseems a little bit\ncontradictory, right?\nLike, well, that doesn't\nseem very sustainable.\nBut again, you're\nweighing competing things.\nSo there's the\nsustainability aspect.\nBut then there's also-- buy-in\nis huge for sustainability.\nSo for a lot of overweight\nor obese people,\nif they start a diet and they\ndon't see something quickly,\nthey bail on it because\nit's not working.\nWhereas if they see some\nrapid results pretty quickly,\nthey buy in even harder.\nAnd so I think that the\nconversation, especially\nfor if there's any coaches\nor trainers out there,\nis just presenting that as the--\none of my favorite lines\nis there are no solutions.\nThere's only trade-offs.\nI think Thomas Sowell said that.\nSo you're having\na trade-off here.\nYes, you're going\nto lose fat faster.\nYou might lose lean\nmass a little bit\nfaster too, which\ncan be a problem.\nBut I will say, the more\nadipose tissue you have,\nthe more aggressively\nyou can diet\nwithout negative consequences.\nSomebody like me doing\na really aggressive diet\nis not going to be\ngood for my lean mass.\nOne, I have a higher\nlean mass than normal.\nTwo, I have a lower\nbody fat than normal.\nAs your body fat goes\ndown, the percentage\nof weight loss from\nlean mass goes up.\nSo people who are very\nobese, because they\nhave so much adipose\ntissue to pull from,\nthere's very little\nreason for the body\nto metabolize lean tissue.\nNow, that being said, if you\ngo on a-- people misinterpret,\nlike, well, I got an\nin-body done or a DEXA done\nand I've lost 2\npounds of lean mass,\nand they've lost\n20 pounds overall.\nWell, keep in mind, adipose\ntissue itself is 13% lean mass.\nSo there's actually\na protein component\nto-- the structural component\nof the adipose tissue.\nAnd it does have some water.\nSo it's about 87% lipid.\nBut the other part is lean.\nSo at minimum, you should expect\na 13% reduction in lean mass\nwhen you diet.\nAnd then when you consider like,\nyou lose body water overall,\nwhich registers as\nlean mass, and you\nlose your splenic tissues\ncan shrink a little bit.\nSo it's normal for the average\nperson to lose 25% or 30%\nof the weight that they\nlose from \"lean mass.\"\nBut that doesn't mean\nskeletal muscle tissue.\nAnd again, the more\nadipose you have,\nthe more aggressively\nyou can approach the diet\nwithout really negative\nlong-term consequences\nto lean mass or\nyour overall health.\nBut balance that with, OK,\nif I'm going to do this,\nI need to understand\nthat I'm not going\nto be dieting this way forever.\nI'm doing this to give myself\na boost at the beginning.\nAnd I have to be\nOK at some point\nwith transitioning\nto something that's\na little bit more sustainable.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Based\non what you just said,\nit reminds me of the satiety\nsignal effect of exercise\nyou mentioned earlier,\nthat exercising\ncan improve our sense of\nwhen we've had enough to eat.\nI just want to briefly mention\nthat when Alia Crum was\non the podcast, she\nmentioned that they'd\nbeen doing a study that--\nI have to pair you two\nand hear the conversation\nas a fly on the wall.\nBecause what she\nwas telling me was\nthat if people believe that a\nfood is nutritious for them,\nthen eating less of it\nregisters as more satiating.\nWhereas if people view dieting\nas a deprivation system,\nlike, oh, dieting is\nhard, and the food sucks,\nand it's terrible,\nwell, then they crave\nall sorts of other things.\nWhereas they actually\nobserve in their studies\nwhere people report reduced\ncraving if they are told,\nfor instance, a chicken breast\nand broccoli and some olive oil\nand rice is actually\nquite nourishing.\nIt's actually\nreally good for you.\nThen people eat that.\nAnd they feel like they've\nactually eaten more.\nThe satiety signaling goes up.\nSo it's just a point\nthat Alia made.\nThose aren't my data.\nLAYNE NORTON: Satiety is\nso impressive because even\nthe rate at which\nyou eat and right\ndown to the size of the plate\nand the color of the plate,\nthe contrast in color--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Really?\nLAYNE NORTON: I can't\nremember exactly.\nI think it's if the plate is\na similar color to the food,\nI think people eat more.\nWhereas if it's a bigger\ncontrast, they eat less.\nSo even plate color can make a\ndifference on how much you eat.\nSo again, human brain,\nvery amazing, but also\nvery dumb in some ways, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not\nan optimized algorithm.\nLAYNE NORTON: I always\njoke with people.\nI'm like, just look at\nhow stupid humans are.\nYou put some water in front\nof them, like the ocean,\nthey're like, oh, yeah, I'll\npay 10 times more for this.\n[CHUCKLES] But we're\nkind of wired that way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The reward\nsignaling pathways in the brain\nrun one chemical mainly,\ndopamine-- there are others,\nof course--\nand very few algorithms.\nIt's sort of like an--\nintermittent reinforcement\nis one, random reinforcement.\nBut in the end, there\naren't many algorithms.\nAnd we are probably not\noptimized-- certainly\nnot optimized for our\nown health because people\nwill eat themselves to death,\ndrug themselves to death,\net cetera, simply because\nsomething felt good\nat one point.\nIt proves your point.\nLAYNE NORTON: Right.\nOne of the things\nI tell people--\nI said this on--\nfor someone's podcast\nwas, interestingly,\nthe dichotomy of\nlife is if you do\nwhat's easy in the short\nterm, your life will be hard.\nIf you do what's hard\nin the short term,\nyour life will get easier.\nIt's very strange.\nAnd actually, Ethan Suplee\nhad a great example of this.\nWhen he was over\n500 pounds, he said,\nthe amount of work I had to\ndo to construct my life that I\ncould just live was\nso much more work\nthan just going to the gym\nfor a couple hours a day.\nHe's like, the gym work is hard.\nHe's like, but when I\nlook back at how much work\nI had to do to sustain that\nlifestyle versus just going\nto the gym and\nrestricting calories,\nhe's like, to maintain the\nlifestyle of being 500 pounds\nwas infinitely more\ndifficult than what I do now.\nAnd so again, great example.\nShort term-- hard.\nGoing to the gym,\ncalorie restriction.\nLong term, life's easier.\nJust a really interesting\ndichotomy I think about a lot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it can't\nbe restated often enough.\nSeed oils.\nPeople want to ask\nabout seed oils.\nAnd for--\nLAYNE NORTON: Cut.\n[CHUCKLES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd for those of you\nthat are listening who are\nwondering why we're chuckling\nalready, I should mentioned\nthat both in the Twitter sphere\nand Instagram and online, there\nare these very polarized views\nthat probably aren't worth\nfocusing on for too long.\nBut there are a number\nof folks out there\nwho are arguing that seed\noils are the source of all--\nthe obesity epidemic--\nLAYNE NORTON: Everything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--inflammation, et cetera--\nLAYNE NORTON: Illuminati.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --everything.\nAnd then there are those that\nwould argue just the opposite,\nthat meat is the source of\nall problems, et cetera.\nAnd I think we've, thanks to\nyour nuance and expertise,\nwe've hopefully\nappropriately framed things\nthat it's never that\nblack and white.\nIt's simply not.\nLAYNE NORTON: Rarely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Rarely.\nI love olive oil.\nI realize that\ndoesn't fit exactly\ninto the seed oil category.\nI love olive oil.\nI use it in moderation.\nI do also consume some butter\nin moderation, et cetera.\nBut are there any\ndata on seed oils?\nAnd here, a good\nexample I think would\nbe canola oil, which comes from\nthe rape seed, that literally\nwas renamed canola oil\nbecause rape seed oil is not\ngood marketing.\nLAYNE NORTON: No, no.\n[CHUCKLES] No, exactly.\nSo the first thing\nI'll say is seed oils\nhave negatively contributed\nto our overall health\nbecause people in the last 20,\n30 years, what they have tended\nto add into their diet that does\nincrease the overall calorie\nload is oil, mostly\nfrom seed oils.\nBut when we look at 1-to-1\nreplacement with other fats--\nif you look at the\nepidemiology, yeah, you\ncan find some\nepidemiology showing\npeople who consume more seed\noil have more negative health\noutcomes.\nProblem is, again, tied up with\na multitude of other behaviors.\nAnd then you can\nfind mechanisms.\nAnd the idea is, well,\nthey're polyunsaturated,\nwhich means in the\nfatty acid chain,\nthere's multiple double bonds,\nwhich those double bonds can\nbe oxidized when they're exposed\nto heat and some other things.\nAnd so the idea is, well, when\nyou cook with these things,\nthey make it oxidized.\nAnd that's going to cause\ninflammation in your body.\nSo that's a plausible mechanism.\nSo as always, I defer to the\nhuman randomized controlled\ntrials.\nAnd so what you tend to\nfind is when you substitute\nsaturated fats for\npolyunsaturated fats,\nit's either neutral or positive\nin terms of the effects on--\ninflammation is\nbasically neutral.\nThere's some studies that\nshow a positive effect\nof doing polyunsaturated fats.\nBut it probably depends on the\nindividual polyunsaturated fat.\nAnd that's the\nother thing that's\ndifficult because\nyou're categorizing\neverything in this one bucket.\nAnd there are some differences\nbetween individual fatty acids.\nEven with saturated fat--\nfor example,\nstearic acid doesn't\ntend to raise LDL cholesterol.\nWhereas saturated fat as a whole\ntends to raise LDL cholesterol.\nBut there are some\nsaturated fats that don't.\nSo again, we're putting\nthings in buckets.\nAnd it's a little more\nnuanced than that.\nThen if you look at the\neffects of polyunsaturated fats\non markers of\ncardiovascular disease,\nagain, tends to either be a\nneutral or positive effect\nwhen you substitute saturated\nfat for polyunsaturated fat.\nNow, if you want to get\ninto monounsaturated\nversus polyunsaturated, there's\nquite a bit of disagreement\nbetween the studies.\nWhat I would say, based on the\nhuman randomized controlled\ntrials, is that\nyou're probably better\noff consuming monounsaturated\nand polyunsaturated\nin place of saturated fat.\nBut again, if the idea is,\nwell, that means polyunsaturated\nare good for me, so I'm just\ngoing to dump a bunch of oil\non everything and now\nyou're upping your calories,\nwell, that's a negative\nnow because you\nhave to deal with the bigger\nproblem of overall energy\ntoxicity.\nSo I'm not somebody who likes to\ndemonize individual nutrients.\nI just haven't seen\nreally compelling evidence\nthat seed oils are the root\ncause of the problems that\nare being suggested.\nAnd I think this is a good\nexample of whenever there's\nsomething that pops up\nin the fitness industry,\nthere's always\nthe opposite thing\nthat pops up and is the\nreactionary, extreme reaction\nto whatever this\nthing was over here.\nAnd I think that's what we're\nseeing with some of the seed\noil stuff, is it's mostly\npeople who are trying to espouse\nthe virtues of saturated fat.\nAnd listen, I think it's fine\nto consume some saturated fat.\nBut again, I think\nlimiting it to 7% to 10%\nof your daily calorie intake\nis probably wise, again,\nbased on all the consensus\nof the evidence I've seen.\nAnd so once again, we're\nstruggling with this.\nOK, we've got this epidemiology\nand these mechanisms\nthat sound good.\nBut then, what\nactually happens when\nwe do some human randomized\ncontrolled trials?\nAnd so far, I just\nhaven't seen the evidence\nto suggest that seed oils\nare independently bad\nfor you, independent of\nthe calories they contain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You said\nthe words, \"overall energy\ntoxicity.\"\nAnd I just want to\nhighlight that I\nthink that's a fabulous term.\nI don't think enough\npeople think about\nthat because they are primed,\nor we are all primed, to think,\nOK, seed oils might be bad.\nOr artificial\nsweeteners might be bad.\nOr this particular\ncomponent of blood work\nmight represent\nsomething good or bad,\nwithout taking into\naccount overall energy\ntoxicity, the toxicity of\noverconsuming calories, energy.\nAnd thank you for pointing out\nthat most of the data point\nto the fact that saturated\nfat should make up\nabout no more than 7% to 10%\nof total daily caloric intake.\nIs there a lower-end threshold\nthat can be problematic?\nFor instance, I've noticed that\nmy blood profiles, especially\nin terms of hormones,\nimprove when I'm getting\nsufficient saturated fat.\nMaybe I'm a mutant.\nBut years ago,\nbecause I'm a product\nof growing up in the '90s,\nI tried a low-fat diet.\nIt certainly crushed\nmy androgen levels.\nI started adding\nsome butter back in.\nAnd I was right back\nin the sweet zone,\nwhere I wanted to be.\nSo 7% to 10% of total daily\ncaloric intake, I'm guessing,\nis probably about what I do now.\nI'll have to check.\nBut is there a danger to going\ntoo low in saturated fats?\nLAYNE NORTON: So\nagain, no solutions,\nonly trade-offs, right?\nWhat maximizes out\ntestosterone might not\nbe the best thing for\nlongevity, and vice versa.\nI'm not making that\nclaim specifically.\nBut I think it's important\nto understand this\nthat I think we\nall have this idea\nthat there's this one\niconic diet out there that\nis going to be the best\ndiet for building muscle\nand burning fat and preventing\ncancer and heart disease.\nAnd the reality is, there's\noverall healthy dietary\npatterns that we see that\nare good for those things.\nBut when we get\ndown into the weeds,\nthere's probably some push\nand pull here, as well.\nSo when it comes\nto saturated fat,\nthere is some evidence that\nif you're too low on it,\nthat yes, you can have a\nreduction in testosterone.\nNow, is that reduction in\ntestosterone, let's say 15%,\n20%, whatever it may be, is that\nsufficient to actually cause\nloss of lean mass?\nThat, we don't know.\nThat's never been shown.\nInterestingly, I\njust remembered this.\nThere was one study that was\ncomparing polyunsaturated fat\nversus saturated fat.\nAnd they equated total fat.\nAnd one of the really\ninteresting things\nwas the group getting\nthe polyunsaturated fat\nhad more lean mass at\nthe end of the study\ncompared to the group\ngetting saturated fat.\nNow, it's only one study.\nI've never seen this replicated.\nSo this is a\nsituation where I say,\nI would like to find out\nwhat the mechanism of that\nis because this\ncould just be random.\nBut if that gets shown over\nand over, what I might say\nis, OK, well, if\npolyunsaturateds are somehow\nincreasing lean mass compared\nto saturated fat, who cares\nwhat happens with testosterone?\nUnless that reduction\nin testosterone\nis causing some kind of\nimpotence for your life, right?\nSo all that to say,\nI don't really know.\nAnd by the way, that's\nsomething, for those watching\nand listening, real experts,\nevery once in a while,\nyou should hear them say the\nfollowing words \"I don't know.\"\n[CHUCKLES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.\nMy graduate advisor was\nexceptional at that.\nAnd she was brilliant, right?\nLAYNE NORTON: And then in\nterms of cholesterol synthesis,\nyou really need a very, very\nsmall amount of saturated fat\nfor LDL cholesterol synthesis.\nYour liver can synthesize--\nthe amount of LDL cholesterol,\nor cholesterol that\nyour body requires\nis so small in terms of just\nliving and being healthy.\nSo I don't think you\nneed to worry about that.\nAnd from a cardiovascular\ndisease standpoint,\nthere is some evidence that\neven taking people who have,\nquote, unquote, \"low\nLDL\" of 80 or 90\nand taking them down\nto like 30 or 40,\nthat there is still a\nbenefit for the risk\nof cardiovascular disease.\nSo again, you're weighing\nthese two buckets.\nSo what I say, if you're doing\n7% and 10% from saturated fat,\nyou're probably fine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I received\na lot of questions about\nwhether or not there\nare female-specific diet\nand exercise protocols.\nAnd I realize this\nis a vast landscape.\nBut some of those\nquestions related\nto menopause and premenopause.\nAnd some related to\nthe menstrual cycle.\nMost related to variations\nacross the menstrual cycle.\nIn terms of, let's just say diet\nmaintenance or subcaloric diet,\nare there any things\nthat you've observed?\nWe'll talk a little bit later\nabout this wonderful app\nthat you've produced,\nthis Carbon app which\nhelps people manage\ntheir energy intake\nand a number of other things.\nAnd so there, you have\na sort of a database,\nor at least an experience base.\nAnd then I'm guessing there\nare probably also studies\nexploring male-versus-female\ndifferences in terms\nof adherence and what\nsorts of diets work.\nAre there any general themes\nthat one can extract from that?\nLAYNE NORTON: This is going to\nbe a really unpopular segment\nfor the women.\nDoesn't seem to make\na big difference.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, actually, they\nmay be relieved to hear\nthat because it makes\nsorting through the\ninformation space\nand certainly the\ninformation we've\ncovered in this podcast\nup until now simpler.\nIt means that everything\nisn't different for them.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah,\nso if you look\nat the male-versus-female\nstudies' relation to diet,\nthey seem to respond\nin a similar way.\nLike, similar\ncalorie deficit seems\nto produce similar results.\nIf you do low carb, high\ncarb, regardless, it\nseems to boil down to\nthe same principles.\nNow, training wise, we\ndo know that females,\nthe muscle fibers adapt a little\nbit differently to training.\nBut without getting\ntoo far into the weeds,\nit doesn't really\nchange the way you\nshould train because for the\nmost part, building muscle,\nthere's a lot of different\nways to build muscle.\nSo we know that light\nloads up to maybe 30 reps,\nas long as it's taken close\nto failure, have basically\nthe same effect on\nbuilding muscle,\nat least in the short term,\nas heavy loads for low reps.\nIt's mostly about\ntaking the muscle close\nto fatigue or failure.\nYou don't have to go to\nfailure, but getting close,\nwithin a few reps.\nIf you're between\none rep and 30 reps,\nif you're getting\nclose to failure,\nseem to produce similar results.\nSo again, great.\nYou can pick whichever form of\ndiscomfort you prefer, right?\nWhen it comes to\nfemale-specific training,\nagain, females\nactually-- this is\none thing that a lot\nof people don't know.\nThey actually put on a\nsimilar amount of lean mass\nas a percentage of their\nstarting lean mass as men.\nIn fact, there's no\nstatistically significant\ndifference in the amount\nof lean mass they put on.\nNow, the absolute amount\nof lean mass that's added\nwill be greater for men because\nthey started with a greater\namount of lean mass.\nBut the relative\nincrease in lean mass\nis pretty much the same\nfrom similar training.\nNow, females, there's some\ndifferences in fiber types,\nthat females tend to be a little\nbit less fatiguable than men.\nThey can go a little bit\nharder a little bit longer.\nAnd there's also some\nevidence that they\nrecover a little bit better.\nBut that also could be\nsimply due to the fact\nthat they're not able\nto use as heavy of loads\nto induce hypertrophy.\nSo I kind of have this theory\nthat while as a percentage\nof your one rep max,\nyou can program things,\nI think absolute load matters.\nWhen you look at the\nmost elite power lifters,\nthe super heavy weights aren't\nsquatting three or four times\na week because they're\nsquatting 800, 900 pounds.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey need to recover.\nLAYNE NORTON: I think that\nthere's an overall recovery\neffect there.\nAgain, I have no\ndata to back this up.\nThis is just my observation.\nBut when you get into the\nlighter weight classes--\nand this goes for\nmen, too-- you do\nsee quite a few people\nwho do many training\nsessions at high\nRPEs and seem to be\nable to recover from that.\nSo I do think the absolute\nload makes a difference.\nNow, when it comes\nto menstrual cycle,\nthis is one of those things\nwhere I kind of tell people,\ndo what you prefer.\nSo there are some\npeople who have said,\nyou should schedule\nyour training\naround your menstrual\ncycle, which\nis whenever you're going\nthrough your menstrual cycle,\nreduce the intensity.\nReduce the volume because you're\nnot going to feel as good.\nYou're not going\nto train as well.\nWhat I would say is\njust autoregulate that.\nIf you go in and you're on\nyour period but you feel good\nand you're doing\nwell that day, then I\ndon't think you necessarily\nneed to back it off.\nAnd there was one study that\nkind of supported that notion.\nBut if you go in and\nyou feel terrible\nand you feel like you could\nuse a reduction in intensity\nand volume, then it's totally\nfine to autoregulate that.\nAnd when I say\nautoregulation, autoregulation\nmeans you are regulating the\nindividual training session\nbased on your performance.\nSo I autoregulate insofar\nas, I'm a super nerd.\nSo I have a velocity device.\nSo I can actually\nattach it to the bar\nand see how fast the load moves.\nAnd I know at various\ndifferent warm-up weights what\nvelocities I should be hitting.\nSo if I hit my last warm-up\nand my velocity is about 10%\nhigher than usual, I\ncan be pretty confident\nthat that's going to\nbe a good day for me.\nIf it's lower, than I can\nback it off a little bit.\nIn fact, at Worlds, when I\nhit my last deadlift warm-up,\nit was 30% faster than I\nusually hit in the gym.\nAnd I turned and\nlooked at my coach\nand I said, yeah, we're\ngoing to get this today.\n[CHUCKLES]\nSo there's various forms\nof ways to autoregulate.\nBut again, women, if you're on\nyour period but you feel good,\nI don't think there's any\nreason you need to back off.\nBut if you're not feeling good,\nthen it's totally appropriate\nto back off.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Raw\nversus cooked foods.\nPeople wanted to\nknow whether or not,\nfor instance, eating\na raw apple versus--\nI don't know.\nDoes anyone cook apples?\nPeople used to bake--\nbaked apples was a\ndessert when I was a kid.\nIt was kind of the\nletdown dessert.\nSorry, Mom.\nThat was not awesome unless it\nhad a scoop of ice cream in it.\nLAYNE NORTON: Or apple pie.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And even\nthen, maybe not awesome.\nBut anyway, raw versus cooked.\nObviously, if you\nburn a piece of meat\nto the point where it's pure\ncharcoal, that's too much.\nAnd there is a small movement\nsurrounding eating raw meats.\nThat's not something\nI particularly enjoy.\nFrankly, sushi is the only\nraw food I personally ingest.\nLAYNE NORTON: Same.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I am\nvery careful about the source,\nfrankly--\nreputable places.\nIs there anything\nreal about this\nin terms of being\nable to extract\nthe amino acids, vitamins,\nand minerals from the food\nraw versus cooked?\nLAYNE NORTON: It just\nlooks cool for Instagram.\nSo when you cook foods, they\nactually tend to become--\nin terms of\nprotein-containing foods,\nthey tend to become more\ndigestible, not less.\nEggs are this way.\nMeats are this way.\nPeople say, well, when you\nheat protein, you denature it.\nAnd I think they hear\nthat word \"denature,\"\nand they think destroy.\nAnd that is not\nwhat denature means.\nSo proteins fold up into\n3D dimensional structures,\nyou know this of course, based\non their amino acid sequence.\nAnd there are specific\nenergies of those amino acids.\nWhen you heat\nprotein or add acid,\nit starts to unfold\nthat protein structure.\nThat happens during\ndigestion anyway.\nSo I always chuckle when--\nI've seen some\ncompanies come out\nwith \"way that\nyou can cook with\"\nthat's not going to\ndestroy the amino acids.\nAnd I'm like, so you\nmean regular way, right?\nSo yeah, typically,\ncooking actually\nmakes amino acids more\nbioavailable, not less.\nNow, I would stay away\nfrom charring your meat\nbecause there is some\nevidence that charring creates\npolyaromatic hydrocarbons,\nwhich at least in animals,\nwhen they give those, they\nappear to be carcinogenic.\nSo if you do char\nyour meat by accident,\nI would just cut off\nthe charred portions.\nAnd then you should be fine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nchar is delicious.\nLAYNE NORTON: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not if\nit's charred too much.\nBut there is something about\na charred crust on a meat.\nMy dad's Argentine and likes\na good charred barbecue.\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What about--\npeople referred to them in their\nquestions as \"carb blockers.\"\nBut I think what\nthey're referring\nto are things like berberine and\nsome of the glucose scavengers.\nAnd one glucose scavenger I'd\nlove for you to comment on\nis this assertion that taking\na brisk walk after a meal,\nor maybe even a slow\nwalk after a meal,\nsome movement can help downshift\nthe amount of circulating\nglucose in some way.\nI've heard that.\nNot a lot of people, but some\nare starting to pay attention\nto this idea of taking\nthings like berberine\nor even metformin\ncan scavenge glucose.\nI personally can't\ntake berberine.\nIf I take it, I get\nmassive headaches\nunless I've ingested tons\nof sugar and carbohydrates.\nSo I just don't\nmess around with it.\nBut I know there are a\nnumber of people out there\nthat want to know whether or\nnot these glucose scavengers can\nbe useful.\nLAYNE NORTON: I think that is\nreally majoring in the minors,\nif I'm being honest.\nAs far as the carb\nblockers, there's\nsome white kidney bean extract\nand those sorts of things.\nThey do block the digestion\nof carbohydrates, some.\nSo when I say \"block,\"\nthose watching or listening,\nmetabolism is typically\nnot on and off switches.\nSo when we say things like\n\"block\" or \"attenuate\"\nor \"inhibit,\"\ntypically we're not\ntalking about just a switch\non the wall that you press it,\nand everything turns off.\nWe're talking about\na dimmer switch, OK?\nSo it just changes the emphasis.\nBut these carb\nblockers can reduce\nthe absorption of carbohydrate.\nNow, they don't seem to cause\nweight loss when you just\ndo it in a normal diet.\nNow, why is that?\nWell, all it does is once\nthose carbohydrates get\nto the large intestine and your\nbacteria get a hold of them,\nthey start fermenting them to\nvolatile fatty acids, which\nget reabsorbed into your liver.\nSo you don't get the\nincrease in blood glucose.\nBut you still get almost\nall the calories from it.\nIt's just in a different form.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.\nLAYNE NORTON: So carb blockers,\nif they actually worked really\nwell, I mean, if you block\nsomething from being absorbed,\nyour GI typically does not just\nlet undigested material sit\nin there.\nYou get diarrhea.\nI mean, that would\nbe the outcome.\nIt's also how I debunked the\nwhole 30 grams of protein\nat a meal, you can't\nabsorb any more than that.\nI'm like, if that was the\ncase, when you ate a steak,\nyou would just start\nhaving diarrhea\nevery time you went over that\n30-gram threshold, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nremember during college--\nso this would be early '90s--\nthere was the Olestra craze.\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis idea of putting\nin a nondigestible thing\ninto things like potato chips\nso that it would clear\nthrough the GI tract\nfaster, not absorb\nas many calories.\nThis went nowhere, obviously.\nYou don't hear\nabout this anymore.\nBut it does raise an\ninteresting question\nrelated to energy balance,\nwhich is gastric emptying time.\nAnd obviously, in the\nlandscape of eating disorders,\nin particular anorexia.\nUse and abuse of\nlaxatives is a way\nin which people will,\nin an unhealthy way,\ntry and control their weight.\nAnd there's a lot of\nproblems with that approach.\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But what\nabout gastric emptying time?\nIs this one way that people\ncould control their energy\nbalance in a healthy way?\nAnd where does fiber\ncome into play?\nLAYNE NORTON: Fiber tends\nto improve GI transit\ntime because it adds bulk.\nSo your GI system\nis basically a tube.\nAnd it has peristalsis, which\nis wavelike contractions that\nmoves the food down\nthrough the tube.\nWell, if you have more bulk\nto the food, like with fiber,\nyou can move it through\na little bit better.\nNow, in the gastric, the\nstomach specifically, fiber\ntends to delay gastric\nemptying and slow it a bit,\nprobably because it\ncongeals a little bit.\nNow, this gets into the\nglycemic index argument, right?\nIf you do low GI\nfoods, you'll have\na slower release of glucose.\nIt's a slower gastric\nemptying time.\nDoes that affect energy balance?\nAnd so there are\nquite a few studies\nlooking at low GI\nversus high GI foods.\nIn the studies where they\ndon't control calories,\nlow GI tends to\noutperform high GI.\nBut when they control calories,\nthere's no difference.\nAnd so what I\nthink that suggests\nis low GI foods,\njust by their nature,\ntend to be higher in fiber.\nAnd so I think it just kind of\ncomes back to the fiber issue.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nI'd like to ask you about\nsupplements for a moment.\nIt's an enormous landscape.\nBut I believe there are a few\nthings that you believe in,\nmeaning they exist.\nAnd there are decent data\nto support their use.\nMaybe even some anecdotal data\nbased on your own experience,\nas long as we highlight it as\nsuch, it could be interesting.\nI've heard you talk about\ntwo in particular, one\nthat I'm very familiar with,\nwhich is creatine monohydrate.\nIf you could share\nyour thoughts on that,\nnot just for muscle building\nbut maybe any other purposes\nfor it.\nAnd then the other one\nis one that frankly I'm\nlearning more about\nall the time now,\nthanks to your prompt,\nwhich is Rhodiola rosea--\nI think I pronounced\nthat correctly--\nand why that might\nbe interesting\nor of use to people.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah, so\ntouching on creatine,\nit is the most tested,\nsafe, and effective support\nsupplement we have.\nI mean, there are thousands of\nstudies on creatine monohydrate\nnow.\nAnd I would say\nvery clearly, too,\nif you're using any\nother form of creatine,\nI think you're\nwasting your money.\nCreatine hydrochloride\nhas some hype around it.\nApparently, it's a\nlittle more soluble.\nThe claim is that you need less.\nBut there's only a\ncouple of studies on it.\nAnd it's more expensive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\ncreatine monohydrate\nis not particularly expensive.\nI realize people have\ndifferent budgets.\nBut it's not a budget breaker.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah, it's gotten\nmore expensive because of COVID\nand supply chain issues.\nThere's forms of creatine\nthat appear to be\nas good, like hydrochloride.\nBut it's more expensive.\nAnd then things like\ncreatine ethyl ester\nhas been shown to be worse\nthan creatine monohydrate.\nBuffered creatine\nis as good or worse.\nAnd it's much more expensive.\nSo I tell people, just\ntake creatine monohydrate.\nIt is tried and true.\nIt's been shown to saturate\nthe muscle cells 100%\nwith phosphocreatine.\nAnd that's what you want.\nSo creatine works through a\nfew different methodologies.\nOne, through increasing\nphosphocreatine content,\nwhich helps improve\nexercise performance.\nIt also appears to\nimprove recovery.\nAnd it increases\nlean mass, a lot\nof which is through bringing\nwater into the muscle cells.\nBut I mean, muscle\ncells are mostly water.\nSo when people say,\nwell, it's just\nwater, that's what\nmuscle cells mostly are.\nAnd it also increases strength\nand some other metrics.\nNow, it also has\nbeen shown in studies\nthat people tend to\nget a decrease in body\nfat percentage.\nNow, that's probably\nbecause they're getting\nan increase in lean mass.\nAnd so the relative\nis a decrease\nin body fat percentage.\nBut there are a few studies that\nshow a decrease in fat mass,\nas well.\nI don't think that\ncreatine is a fat burner.\nI think that people are\nable to train harder, build\nmore lean tissue.\nAnd so that's probably\nhaving an effect on fat mass.\nThen they've actually\nshown more recently\nsome cognitive benefits\nto creatine, which I find\nreally interesting, as well.\nBut the only knock on creatine\nthat anybody's been able\nto come up with-- because\nthey've debunked the kidney\nstuff; they've debunked\nthe liver study;\nthere's no evidence that it\nharms healthy kidney or liver--\nis hair loss.\nSo what about hair loss?\nBecause there was\none study in 2009\nthat showed that\ncreatine increased DHT.\nBut they didn't\nreally show an effect\non any other sex hormone.\nSo it's kind of strange.\nLike, you would think if\nthere was an increase in DHT,\nthere would be something\nelse that changes, as well.\nAnd it's only one study.\nAnd again, didn't directly\nmeasure hair loss.\nIt measured DHT, which\nwe know is involved\nin the loss of the follicle.\nSo what I would say is\nthat I am not convinced.\nIt's only one study.\nNever been replicated\nto my knowledge.\nAnd it was looking at\na mechanism rather than\nan outcome.\nSo if you're somebody\nwho's prone to hair loss\nand you want to avoid creatine\nbecause of that, I understand.\nBut for most people, I\ndon't think it's something\nto worry about.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\nemphasize the classic loading\nof creatine, taking it\na bunch of times per day\nand then backing off?\nOr just taking it\nconsistently at the--\nI think 5 grams per day is the\ntypical dose that people take.\nLAYNE NORTON: So again, no\nsolutions, only trade-offs.\nYou can load it.\nAnd you will saturate your\nphosphocreatine stores faster,\nusually within a week.\nIf you just take\n5 grams per day,\nit'll take two,\nthree, four weeks.\nBut you will get\nto the same place.\nAnd you're probably\ngoing to have\na much lower risk of GI issues.\nCreatine can be a gut irritant.\nIf it is for some folks, I\nwould recommend splitting it\ninto multiple doses, so\nmaybe multiple 1- or 2-gram\ndoses per day.\nAnd definitely don't load\nit if you're somebody\nwho has GI issues from it.\nAs far as Rhodiola\nrosea, the research\nis still in its infancy.\nI was just reading a\nnew systematic review\nthat concluded that we need\nmore high-quality research.\nBut the research\nthat is out there\nseems to suggest\nthat not only does it\nreduce physical fatigue.\nBut also reduces the\nperception of fatigue\nand may also enhance memory\nand cognition, as well.\nAnd it's referred\nto as an adaptogen.\nSo I really like it.\nMy anecdotal\nexperience is when I\ncombine that with caffeine,\nit tends to smooth out\nthe effects of caffeine.\nIt's a more pleasant experience.\nAnd there's also some evidence\nthat if you're coming off\ncaffeine, that it can\nreduce the negative side\neffects to caffeine\nwithdrawal, which, by the way,\nI didn't really believe\nin that until I actually\ndid a cold turkey--\nso before a meet, I will cut\nout caffeine for seven days\nbecause you can basically\nreset your caffeine\ntolerance in seven days.\nAnd two days in, I\nmean, I'm groggy.\nI've got the headaches.\nUsually, I'll get body aches\nthat come up because caffeine\nis actually a mild analgesic.\nAnd yeah, so it was\nvery interesting to see-\nbut I slept like a baby,\nI'll tell you that.\nI slept like a baby.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthen you took caffeine\nprior to your event--\nLAYNE NORTON: To the meet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So you really\nwant the maximum punch from it.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's why you do that.\nLAYNE NORTON: Yeah.\nAnd like I said,\nRhodiola tends to--\nit doesn't eliminate\nthose negative effects.\nBut it tends to dampen\nthem a little bit.\nSo I really like it.\nAgain, would like to\nsee more research on it.\nBut there's a lot\nmore stuff coming out.\nAshwagandha is another thing\nthat looks pretty promising.\nSeems to increase\ntestosterone modestly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nLAYNE NORTON: They've shown\nincreases in lean mass.\nI don't think the\nincrease in testosterone\nexplains the increase\nin lean mass.\nIt's just not a big\nenough increase.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could it\nbe the decrease in cortisol?\nPeople have talked about--\nLAYNE NORTON: It's possible.\nIt does decrease\nstress hormones.\nIt also has been shown\nto help with sleep.\nBut I would like to see\nmore research looking at,\nmechanistically, how it's\nincreasing lean mass before I\nsay conclusively that\nthis is the next creatine.\nThere's more research\nthat needs to come out.\nAnd then there's some other\nthings that have an effect.\nCitrulline malate, there\nwas a new meta analysis that\nshowed that\ncitrulline malate can\nreduce fatigue and increase,\nI think, time to fatigue.\nAnd it may actually have\nsome small recovery benefits,\nas well.\nDifferent forms of\ncarnitine can actually\nhave recovery benefits.\nAnd actually-- interesting-- I\nthink it's carnitine tartrate\nactually has been shown--\nVolek published a\nstudy that actually\nshowed that it increased\nandrogen-receptor density\nin muscle cells.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's interesting.\nL-carnitine and its\nother forms are pretty--\nI think there's good\nevidence that they\ncan improve sperm and\negg health for people\nwho are looking to conceive.\nLAYNE NORTON: Oh, interesting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, there\nare a surprising number\nof studies on this in humans.\nBut yeah,\nandrogen-receptor density--\nand that's from\noral L-carnitine.\nPeople are taking capsules,\nnot injecting directly\ninto the muscle, yeah.\nLAYNE NORTON: And then\nyou've got things obviously\nlike the other most effective\nsupplement out there\nis probably caffeine.\nI mean, if you look at\nthe research studies,\ncaffeine produces\nvery consistently\nimprovements in performance.\nSo that's another one.\nSome people don't like\nthe effect of caffeine.\nThat's OK.\nBut--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I wouldn't know\nbecause I've never come off it.\n[CHUCKLES]\nLAYNE NORTON: Exactly, exactly.\nWell, interestingly,\nthey do show\nthat the effect appears\nto be consistent,\nthat even if you're a\nhabitual caffeine user,\nyou do still get a benefit\nevery time you take it.\nBut like you said,\nyou're just used to it.\nSo there's those things.\nThen you've got things\nlike beta alanine,\nwhich it's in our preworkout.\nProbably not super helpful\nfor most people for resistance\ntraining.\nIt does seem to have some\nbenefits for high intensity.\nIf you get out more than\n45 seconds or 60 seconds\nof really hard\ntraining, it does appear\nto help with delaying\nfatigue for that.\nAnd then you've got\nthings like betaine,\nor also called\ntrimethylglycine, which\nthere's some evidence it\ncan improve lean mass.\nThere's some evidence that\nit can improve power output.\nSo there's a few\nthings out there.\nBut most of the stuff\nis not very good.\nSo I think that those kinds\nof supplements, very useful.\nBut again, I would never tell\npeople they need supplements.\nAgain, even something\nlike creatine\nis going to be a very\nsmall effect compared\nto proper nutrition,\nrecovery, and hard training.\nOne of the things--\nI was talking with Ben\nBruno the other day.\nAnd I said, you\nknow, some people\nwill ask me like, how does\nthis person make progress?\nBecause their programming\nis not evidence-based?\nOr this guy, his\nexercises are dumb.\nAnd I'll say, yeah, but\nthey trained really hard\nfor 20 years.\nOne commonality you see between\nreally successful athletes\nor bodybuilders is\nthey train really hard.\nAnd one of the things\nI have observed\nis the more into the\nweeds people tend to get--\nand again, this is just my\nown anecdote and observation--\nthe more in the weeds they\ntend to get, the less hard\nI see them train.\nAnd so one of the\nthings I really\nlike that Mike Israetel\nsaid, who's got a PhD\nand is a bodybuilder\nhimself, he said,\nyou can't outscience\nhard training,\nthat if you're looking\nto build muscle\nand you're looking to improve\nyour body composition,\nthe main thing is just\ndoing the work over time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Consistency\nand the hard work.\nAnd I would add to that--\nand this is true of academic\nendeavors, too, of course;\nI hope you'll agree--\nLAYNE NORTON: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --which is\nthat, yeah, the other thing is,\ngiven the mental\nside-- earlier we\nwere talking about how\nsatiety signals in the brain\nand what you think about\nfoods can be relevant.\nLearning to really enjoy\ntraining hard in addition\nto learning to really\nenjoy eating well,\nnot just for the effects that\nit has on body composition--\nthose, too, of course.\nBut just learning to really\nenjoy the process of training\nhard and a really hard\nworkout or a really hard paper\nthat you have to sort\nthrough or really digging\nthrough a book\nthat's challenging,\nlearning to really enjoy that, I\nthink, if there is a power tool\nout there, it's the\npsychological end.\nLAYNE NORTON: And I\nthink a lot of that\nis getting the confidence\nof doing something hard,\nthat there's a\npayoff at the end.\nI get asked a lot in my Q&As,\nhow do I get more confident?\nHow do I become more confident?\nAnd I'll tell people,\nyou have to do.\nThere's no hack.\nYou can't read about it.\nYou've got to get in the arena.\nAnd I don't mean like compete\nin sports necessarily, but doing\na PhD or doing something, just\nsomething hard, where you're\nputting yourself out there.\nAnd you're saying,\nthis is my goal.\nAnd I'm going to go for it.\nYou just learn so much by\ndoing that about yourself.\nAnd so just what you said, I\nwill reframe things in my mind\nwhen bad things happen from--\nit's not to say I never get\nstressed out, because I do.\nAnd it's not to say that I\nnever get down, because I do,\nbecause I'm a human.\nBut when something bad happens--\nI actually posted about\nthis in my story today.\nWhen something bad happens,\nvery rarely anymore do I go,\nwoe is me.\nWhy did this happen to me?\nBecause you're in the universe.\nRandom bad things\nare going to happen.\nSo instead, I say--\nif I'm not dead--\ninstead, I say, well, what\nan exciting opportunity\nto overcome an obstacle.\nAnd I bet, because in the\nexperience of my life,\nthe biggest lessons and\nthe best things in my life\nhave actually come out\nof the most challenging,\nworst things that have happened.\nAnd so again, I\nwould never have been\nable to do these sorts of\nthings if I hadn't taken up\nweightlifting, because\nweightlifting taught me\nso much about perseverance,\ndelayed gratification,\novercoming obstacles.\nAnd that's why I love\nit even to this day.\nAnd I'll still get\nbutterflies when\nI go in for a squat\nsession, even though I've\nbeen doing it for 23 years.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's wonderful.\nWell, it's clear that\nyou embrace hard things.\nAnd for people listening\nto this, obviously\nit doesn't have to\nbe weightlifting--\npicking hard things,\nlearning an instrument,\nlearning a language.\nChallenge is an\nabsolute builder.\nLAYNE NORTON: And\nthey've actually\nshown those sorts of things,\nwhen you challenge yourself\nand also mentally, I think there\nwas a new study that came out\nbasically showing a reduction\nin the risk of Alzheimer's\nand other age-related\ncognitive decline.\nI mean, basically, use\nit or lose it, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, the desire\nand the will to persevere no\ndoubt translates to this thing\nthat we call the\nwill to live, right?\nIt's related to\nthe will to live.\nWell, I think that what\nyou just said beautifully\nembodies what most people are\naspiring to, which is to--\nI think most people actually\nwant to do hard things.\nThey don't just want\nto have the results.\nI think that most\npeople deep down\nhave some understanding that\ntheir reward system works\nthat way.\nI must say, this\nconversation for me\nhas been tremendously rewarding.\nFirst of all, it\nallowed me to meet you\nin person for the first time,\nwhich I've really enjoyed.\nCertainly, this won't\nbe our last interaction\non this podcast and elsewhere.\nAlso, the amount of knowledge\nthat you contain inside you\nis astonishing.\nAnd--\nLAYNE NORTON: There's a lot of\nstuff rattling around up there.\n[CHUCKLES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd we all benefit\nbecause your ability to pull\nfrom the mechanistic side,\nagain I think not\nlimited to but related\nto your background in\nbiochemistry, all the way\nthrough to the impact in\nhumans, animal studies,\nbeing able to understand\nwhere those sit relative\nto one another.\nAnd then you're\nobviously a practitioner.\nYou practice what you preach.\nAnd what you talk about\npertains to men, to women,\nyounger people, older\npeople, people who are vegan,\nKeto, carnivore.\nYou really are able to net\na tremendous number of ideas\nwhile staying really\nnuanced and data driven.\nAnd so I just want to say\nfor myself and on behalf\nof the listeners,\nreally appreciate\nyou coming in here today and\nsharing with us your knowledge.\nWe will absolutely point people\nin the direction of where\nthey can learn more about you.\nAnd one of the places\nthat I definitely\nwant to mention before we part,\nhowever, is this Carbon app.\nAnd I should just mention\nthis isn't a paid promotion\nor anything of that sort.\nActually, one of our\npodcast team members\nhas been using Carbon\nfor a long time.\nThis is an app that\nyou devised which\nallows people to navigate the\nexercise, nutrition, and energy\nbalance space for weight loss,\nmuscle gain, fat loss, weight\nmaintenance.\nI would just like to\nbriefly ask you about that\nbefore we conclude.\nWithout necessarily\ntelling us everything\nthat's in the\nCarbon app, I'd love\nto know, what are the\nmajor things that it\ndoes and is good for?\nAnd then, what were\nsome of the key things\nthat you wanted to\nmake sure were in there\nwhen you built it?\nWhat's the logical\nbackbone behind it?\nBecause I think there\nare a lot of food\ncounting, calorie counting,\nexercise apps out there.\nEveryone I've\ntalked to that uses\nCarbon, including\nour mutual friend,\nSaagar Enjeti, this member\nof my podcast, et cetera,\nraves about it.\nSo what is Carbon?\nAnd what does it do?\nAnd what was your\nmindset in building it?\nWhat did you really\nwant to see there\nthat you didn't see elsewhere?\nLAYNE NORTON: So those\nlistening may not know,\nbut I started online\ncoaching people for nutrition\nback in 2005.\nAnd that was the vast\nmajority of my business\nall the way up until 2017.\nAnd I had a lot of\nsuccess with that,\nwhether it be just average\nfolks looking to lose weight\nor build muscle and\nright up to elite level\ncompetitors in physique sport.\nSo I had this idea, like--\nI don't want to\nsay I had the idea.\nA few people had the idea.\nWhat if we could take\nwhat I do in coaching\nand try to automate as\nmuch of that as possible?\nBecause by the time I was\nbecoming a really popular\ncoach, I mean, I was expensive.\nYou were looking\nat me charging--\nI got to the point where I\nwas charging about $1,000\na month for coaching.\nAnd most people\ncannot afford that.\nAnd I would like to not\njust coach rich people.\n[CHUCKLES] You know what I mean?\nI would like to be able\nto help other people.\nSo the idea was to\ncreate an app that\ncould do some of this stuff.\nNow, there's always a place\nfor human interaction.\nBut for people who\ncan't afford that,\nour app is basically\n$10 a month.\nAnd basically, what we wanted\nto do was set up an app where--\nthink about if you went\nto a nutrition coach.\nWhat would they do?\nThey would probably ask you\nsome questions about your goals,\ntake some anthropometrics,\nmaybe dietary preference.\nAnd they'd use that information\nto kind of formulate\na baseline plan.\nThat's what Carbon does.\nSo I think there's eight\nquestions in the signup\nflow about your activity,\nyour exercise, your lifestyle,\nyour body weight, your\nbody fat percentage.\nAnd if you don't know it,\nwe help you calculate it.\nIt's not perfect.\nBut it's better than nothing.\nAnd then your\ndietary preferences.\nAnd we use that to come\nup with your baseline.\nAnd your baseline will be\nyour calories, your protein,\nyour carbohydrates, and fats.\nAnd what's different\nabout our app--\nbecause apps like\nMyFitnessPal or whatever\nwill do that, as well.\nWhat's different\nabout ours is we\nencourage people to log their\nweight daily for the reasons\nthat we talked about earlier.\nAnd then you can also\ntrack your food in the app.\nAnd honestly, I think our food\ntracker is actually way easier\nto use than most\nof them out there.\nWhat we typically get\ngreat rave reviews\nabout is how user-friendly\nour interface is,\nthat it makes intuitive sense.\nAnd so you track your food,\ntry to hit these macros\nthat you're prescribed.\nAnd each week, you\nwill be prompted\nto check in with a coach\non your check-in day.\nAnd then you put in\nsome information.\nAnd then based on how\nyou're progressing,\nthe app will adjust\nor not adjust based\non how you're progressing.\nSo for example, if you're\nhitting a weight-loss plateau,\nit will sense that.\nAnd it will reduce\nyour calories.\nOr if you're trying\nto gain weight\nand you've hit a plateau,\nit'll increase your calories.\nAnd there's a lot of\nback-end algorithm\nstuff that takes care of this.\nBut the fundamental\ncrux of the app\nis we try to determine\nyour total daily energy\nexpenditure because\nthat's going to tell us\nthe first big thing\nwe need to know,\nwhich is, how many calories\ndo you need to be eating\nfor your goal, right?\nSo on the front\nend, we basically\ndo our best guess based\non your anthropometrics.\nIt's not going to be perfect.\nBut it'll get us\nin the ballpark.\nAnd if you do know, like\nsome people already know,\nwell, I know what I\nmaintain my body weight on,\nthere's actually a spot where\nyou can manually enter that\nduring the signup flow.\nSo that's helpful for people\nwho are super nerds like me.\nBut then people will ask, well,\ndo you take Apple Watch data?\nDo you take this?\nDo you take that?\nAnd no, for the reasons\nwe talked about,\nthat it overestimates\nenergy expenditure.\nWhat our app does is\nit's an algebra equation.\nIf you-- because\nyour body weight,\nyour maintenance calories\nis your total daily energy\nexpenditure.\nYour average calories that\nyou eat to maintain your body\nweight will be the same as your\ntotal daily energy expenditure.\nSo if we know how body\nweight is changing\nand we know how many calories\nthe person is consuming,\nwe can actually solve for\nwhat energy expenditure is.\nAnd you can see in\nthe app that we'll--\nthere's a maintenance calorie\ntracker, or energy expenditure\ntracker.\nAnd typically, after\nabout three to four weeks,\neven if the app\nwas off at first,\nit will have you pretty darn\nclose because, let's say\nsomebody comes on.\nAnd their goal is to\nlose a pound and a half\na week or something like that.\nAnd the first week,\nthey lose 3 pounds.\nNow, the app actually\naccounts for the fact\nthat you can lose more\nwater weight the first week.\nSo they probably wouldn't\nget an adjustment.\nBut let's say the next\nweek, they lose 3 pounds.\nThe app will sense that and\nadjust their calories up\nbecause it will be estimating\nthat their energy expenditures\nare actually higher\nthan what it previously\nestimated based on the amount\nof weight they're losing.\nAnd the same thing\ngoes in reverse.\nIf they're not losing\nthe amount of weight\nthat they're supposed\nto, it will lower them\nbased on the fact that it may\nhave overestimated their energy\nexpenditure.\nBut that's the first crux of\nit, is tracking that energy\nexpenditure.\nAnd then the next\nthing is protein.\nSo when the back-end\nalgorithm stuff is happening,\ncalories are set first\nbased on your energy\nexpenditure and your goal.\nSo for example, if you're\non an aggressive diet,\nyour calories are going to\nbe lower even if your energy\nexpenditure might be a\nlittle bit high, just\nbecause if you're trying to\nlose 2 pounds a week, I mean,\nyou're going to be in a pretty\naggressive calorie deficit.\nSo it's going to set\nthe calories first.\nThen, it will set protein\nbased on your lean body mass.\nThen, the calories\nthat are left over\nwill be allotted to\ncarbohydrate and fat\ndepending on your\ndietary preference.\nAnd we have a few different\ndietary preferences.\nThere's balanced, which is about\n50/50 to 60/40 carbohydrate\nto fat of the\nremaining calories.\nThen you have low fat,\nwhich is obviously a higher\nratio of carbohydrates.\nYou have low carb.\nYou have a ketogenic diet,\nwhich is very, very low carb.\nAnd then there's also\na plant-based option.\nAnd within each\nof those options,\nstill, you can go in and\nactually shimmy the macros\na little bit within\na certain range\nso that you can kind of dial\nin what your specific dietary\npreference is\nbecause, again, if we\ngo back to what is going\nto produce the best\nlong-term results, it's whatever\nthe person can adhere to.\nSo we really try to start\nwith the concept of adherence\nby allowing people to have the\ndietary preference that they\nwant.\nAnd there's some other apps\nout there that are good apps.\nFor example, we get\nasked a lot, what's\nthe difference between our\napp and the Renaissance\nPeriodization app?\nAnd they have a great app.\nBut theirs is kind\nof more rigid.\nAnd it'll say, you're going\nto eat this many meals.\nAnd you're going to have\nthese foods at these times.\nSo we're kind of the opposite.\nWe want to give you\nmaximum flexibility.\nNow, for some people, they\nwould prefer the rigid structure\nat first.\nBut we find that\nfor most people,\ngiving them more flexibility\ntypically improves\nadherence over the long run.\nSo that's kind of\nhow the app works.\nAnd again, there's\nmultiple different goals.\nIt's not just a weight-loss app.\nThere's a maintenance.\nThere's muscle-building.\nSo you've got all kinds\nof different goals that\ncan be accommodated, different\nrates of each of those goals.\nAnd I mean, I've used the\napp for over three years\nnow to do my body weight.\nAnd I mean, when I say\nthat it's dialed me\nin-- because I'm very regimented\nwith logging and logging\nmy weight.\nSo what I targeted to\nweigh in at Worlds,\nI got down to the 0.1 kilogram.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's fantastic.\nLAYNE NORTON: So it\nwas pretty cool to be\nable to use a tool that I helped\ndevelop to actually coach me.\nSo it's a great tool.\nWe did some statistics.\nWe polled 2,500 members.\nAnd one of the\nquestions we asked is,\nwould you recommend\nthis to a friend?\nAnd 91% said yes.\nSo I think our average\nretention is, like,\nseven months, which for an\napp that costs $10 a month\nis really great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's great.\nYeah, as I mentioned, a number\nof people I know use it.\nThis is not a paid promotion.\nBut I think people need\nguidance and tools.\nAnd what we know about the\nhuman brain is that winging it\ncan work, but that the brain\nwill cheat itself often.\nThere's a Feynman\nquote about this.\nAnd I'll get it wrong.\nIt's always bad to try\nand quote Feynman anyway\nbecause he said\nit so much better.\nBut that we are the easiest--\nit's easy to fool\nourselves basically,\nis what he was saying--\neasiest to fool ourselves.\nLAYNE NORTON: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds great.\nWe will put a link to it so\nthat people can check it out.\nAgain, it sounds like a\nwonderful tool and a tool that\nnets a lot of the\nprinciples that\nsit as major themes for\nweight loss, weight gain.\nI would assume directed\nlean tissue gain is\nwhat most people are after,\nand weight maintenance\nbecause a number of people\nwould like to just maintain.\nListen, I really appreciate\nyour time and all\nthat you're doing, certainly,\nyour time and energy\nand knowledge\ntoday but also what\nyou're doing on the various\nsocial media channels.\nAnd just the fact that somebody\nfrom the depths of academia\nis out there sharing\nso much knowledge\nacross so many\ndomains, you're a gem\nin this landscape\nof nutrition and one\nthat people really\nneed to hear from.\nSo thank you so\nmuch for your time.\nLAYNE NORTON: Thank you.\nI appreciate the opportunity.\nI really enjoyed it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe'll do it again.\nThank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion with Dr.\nLayne
