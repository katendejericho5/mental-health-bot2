    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Gary\nSteinberg Dr Gary Steinberg is a medical\ndoctor PhD professor of neurosurgery\nneurosciences and neurology at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine he is a\nworld expert in what is called the\ncerebrovascular architecture of our our\nbrain which is a scientific term\nexplaining how blood flow to the brain\nsupplies oxygen and critical nutrients\nto our neurons our nerve cells as well\nas playing a critical role in removing\nwaste products from our brain in order\nfor our brain to function normally\nduring today's discussion he explains in\nvery clear terms how blood flow to the\nbrain occurs and how disruptions in\nblood flow in things like stroke and\naneurysm impact brain functioning we\nalso discuss concussions and TBI or\ntraumatic brain injuries which\nunfortunately are very common and what\ncan be done to treat concussion and\ntraumatic brain injury Dr Steinberg also\nshares with us recent findings from his\nlaboratory and Clinic revealing how stem\ncells can be used to recover function in\nthe human brain and spinal cord after\nthings like concussion TBI stroke and\nother disruptions to the cerebrovascular\narchitecture and he shares with us the\nscience supported tools that is\nprotocols that any of us can use to\nimprove the health and functioning of\nour brains so if you or somebody that\nyou know has experienced concussion or\ntraumatic brain injury stroke or\naneurysm today's discussion is sure to\ninclude Vital Information for you and\nfor those fortunate enough to not have\nexperienced those conditions today's\ndiscussion will also review the latest\nscience and protocols for improving\nbrain health before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity now I've spoken many times\nbefore on this podcast about the fact\nthat sleep is the critical foundation\nfor mental health physical health and\nperformance now one of the key things to\ngetting the best possible night sleep is\nto control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment and that's because\nin order to fall and stay deeply asleep\nyour body temperature actually needs to\ndrop by about 1 to 3° and in order to\nwake up feeling refreshed and alert your\nbody temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3° eight Sleep\nmattress covers make it extremely easy\nto control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment and thereby to\ncontrol your core body temperature so\nthat you fall and stay deeply asleep and\nwake up feeling your absolute best I've\nbeen sleeping on an eight- Sleep\nmattress cover for about 3 years now and\nit has completely transformed the\nquality of my sleep for the better eight\nsleep recently launched their newest\ngeneration of pod cover the Pod 4 ultra\nthe Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and\nheating capacity higher Fidelity sleep\ntracking technology and the Pod 4 cover\nhas snoring detection that will\nautomatically lift your head a few\ndegrees to improve air flow and stop\nyour snoring this is really important\nsnoring is associated with something\ncalled sleep apnea and sleep apnea is\nknown to disrupt brain health and body\nHealth in a number of ways put\ndifferently being able to breathe\nclearly throughout the night is\nessential for not only feeling rested\nwhen you wake up but also for brain\nhealth and body Health if you'd like to\ntry an eights Sleep mattress cover you\ncan go to 8sleep.com\nhuberman to save3 50 off their pod 4\nultra

and\nsunglasses that are of the absolute\nhighest quality now I've spent a\nlifetime working on the biology of the\nvisual system and I can tell you that\nyour visual system has to contend with\nan enormous number of different\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly Roa understands this and\nhas developed their eyeglasses and\nsunglasses so that regardless of the\nconditions you're in you always see with\nthe utmost Clarity Roa eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially designed for\nuse in sport in particular things like\nrunning and cycling now as a consequence\nRoa frames are extremely lightweight so\nmuch so that most of the time you don't\neven remember that they're on your face\nthey're also designed so that they don't\nslip off if you get sweaty now even\nthough they were initially designed for\nperformance in sport they now have many\ndifferent frames and styles all of which\ncan be used in sport but also when out\nto dinner at work essentially

Aeropress\nachieves this because it uses a very\nshort contact time between the hot water\nand the coffee and that short contact\ntime also means that you can brew an\nexcellent cup of coffee very quickly the\nwhole thing takes only about 3 minutes I\nstarted using an arrow press over 10\nyears ago and I learned about it from a\nguy named Alan Adler who's a former\nStanford engineer who's also an inventor\nhe developed things like the aobi\nFrisbee in any event I'm a big fan of\nAdler inventions and when I heard he\ndeveloped a coffee maker the Aro press I\ntried it and I found that indeed it\nmakes the best possible tasting cup of\ncoffee it's also extremely small and\nportable so I started using it in the\nlaboratory when I tried on the road and\nalso at home and I'm not alone in my\nlove of the Aeropress coffee maker with\nover 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is\nthe best reviewed coffee press in the\nworld if you'd like to try Aeropress you\ncan go to Aero press.com huberman

Andrew\npleasure to be here I have a lot of\nquestions I know people are interested\nin keeping their brains healthy and\nsadly things happen to the brain um\nsometimes as a consequen of Aging\nsometimes as a consequence of certain\nactivities maybe you could just explain\nfor us right off the bat what is a\nstroke what is an aneurism what is a\nhemorrhage where do these terms overlap\nhow are they different obviously none of\nus want these things um and we will talk\nabout ways to prevent them and your ways\nof treating them as well of course but\njust to start off maybe we can just lay\ndown the nomenclature sure so a stroke\nis like a heart attack of the brain\nuh it involves disruption of blood flow\nto the brain either in the form of a\nblocked vessel or less likely a\nhemorrhage about 87% of Strokes are due\nto uh a clot either forming in the brain\nartery itself or forming uh closer to\nthe heart in the heart or in the cored\nartery and dislodging and blocking blood\nflow to the brain about 133% are caused\nby a hemorrhage Bur thing of a blood\nvessel and that results in lack of\noxygen and glucose being delivered to\nthe brain cells and that ultimately\ncauses death of tissue and disruption of\nbodily functions neurologic function\nthat's what a stroke is how do we know\nif we have clots residing in our body\nthat could be dislodged um I know that\nsome people when they fly we wear\ncompression socks um I know that some\npeople have genetic mutations that\naffect clotting I'll raise my hand here\nand uh I'll do a disclosure I did some\ngenetic testing I may heterozygote for\num Factor five lien which is a clotting\nFactor um heterozygote folks means I\nhave one mutant copy so fortunately I\ndon't suffer from excessive bleeding or\nclotting but there are lifestyle factors\nthat can exacerbate a an existing um\nmutation like that people who are\nhomozygous mutants for five lien of\ncourse at much greater risk for um\nclotting and bleeding um so I just\ndisclosed a lot um maybe you could\ncomment on some of the clotting factors\nand lifestyle factors that impact\nclotting but how would somebody know if\nthey're like they've got a clot that\ncould potentially go to their brain sure\nwell you might not know in many cases\nyou don't know uh and that's the problem\nyou can have uh a predisposition as you\nsay due to uh certain genes that are mut\nated or uh represented that predisposed\nto to clots and those clots can occur on\nthe arterial side or the Venus side the\narterial side is what generally causes a\nstroke an es schic stroke uh on the\nVenus side you can sometimes uh have\nproblems uh when you talk about flying\num not moving your legs developing clots\nin your legs wearing compression boots\nthat's on the Venus side and that can\ncause uh something like a uh deep vein\nthrombosis uh which is not good because\nit can travel to the lung and cause a\npulmonary embolis that generally on the\nVenus side does not go to the brain oh\ngood in my case that unfortunate exactly\nuh you can develop some Venus problems\nin the brain which can cause a Venus\ntype type stroke that's much less common\nand the way that causes a stroke is not\nlack of blood flow being delivered to\nthe brain\nbut by having a clot in an important\nvein the blood can't get out of the\nbrain it backs up and causes swelling or\nedema uh but that's much less common uh\ngenerally we talk about Strokes as being\nuh arterial in nature um and you know\neither that either blockage of a blood\nvessel or bursting of of a\nvessel what are some things that impact\nclotting and or excessive bleeding um my\nunderstanding is these Factor five light\nin mutations are one example the other\nis um let's say somebody takes say a a\nblood thinning um agent like baby\naspirin or um I told and I I'll have to\ncheck this I'm sure people will say in\nthe YouTube comments that if you take\nlots and lots of say fish oil or things\nlike that you can become more of a\nbleeder some are uh people out there are\nhemophiliacs and then my understanding\nis also that certain forms of oral\ncontraception for women can increase uh\nthe rates of bleeding um so tell me if\nI'm wrong about any of those and if any\nof those things predispose people to\nmore stroke or\nHemorrhage sure so um different kinds of\ndrugs um thin the blood and they um can\npredispose you to having a larger\nHemorrhage uh than you would if\nsomething uh bursts or if you uh fall\nand have some traumatic injury to your\nbrain or anywhere in the body uh in\ngeneral they don't cause a hemorrhage\nbecause they're fairly safe but uh if\nthere's as I say some uh it's some\nInterruption um to the to the body um\nlike a bruise um it would be a much\nworse um type of\nbleed uh so aspirin is a type of\nantiplatelet agent that thins the blood\nthere are many types of antiplatelet\nagents and they're very very uh useful\nfor treating people who have uh a a\npredisposition to develop clots because\nthey thin the blood anticoagulants are\nanother type uh they're they're called\nuh they're known as kumin warin elquist\nthere's lots of lots of new agents um\nand uh they're often taken orally or can\nbe given intravenously uh heprin another\none uh again they thin the blood so they\nwould uh put someone at somewhat\nincreased risk for\nHemorrhage um then uh as far as oral\ncontraceptives if you go back to the\n1970s when the uh oral contraceptives\nwere first generation were coming out uh\nit turns out and they were heavily\nestrogen um dominated rather than\nprogesterone um they did and they still\nto some extent increased the risk of\ndeveloping clouds so women back in the\n70s\nwho took oral contraceptives and\nsmoked had a very very high incidence of\ndeveloping uh clots and and Es schic\nstrokes and clots elsewhere in the body\nthe newer Generations are are much safer\nin terms of De developing clots but for\nmy patients uh many of whom have had\nStrokes or at risk for stroke we\nrecommend that the women do not take\noral uh contraceptives that they use\nsome other form uh IUD for instance may\nhave a little bit of uh progesterone\nwhich is released locally but it doesn't\ncause a large increase in estrogens or\nor progesterone\nsystemically so we still believe that\nthe oral contraceptives uh increase the\nrisk somewhat not the way it did for\nfirst generation and then there are\nother modifiable factors besides the\ngenetic ones so smoking is a very uh\nhigh risk factor for developing uh clots\num which can lead to Strokes heart\nattacks peripheral vascular\ndisease um High lipids is another so\nwhen people have\nhigh bad cholesterol LDL it's\nrecommended uh that if they can't reduce\nit with diet that they take a Statin um\nthe statins are very very effective in\nlowering the bad cholest stro preventing\nstrokes and heart attack interestingly\nthe statins have also been shown to be\nhighly beneficial for the for the blood\nvessel Integrity even if you don't have\nhigh LDL interesting so they have other\nbeneficial properties so again for my\npatients I often recommend they take a\nStatin even if they don't have high\ncholesterol interesting and then\nhypertension is another uh risk factor\nfor for developing uh clots and and\narterial disease when you say that\nsmoking dramatically increases the risk\nof stroke is that because of nicotine\nper se is it the uh Vaso constriction\nand blood pressure elevation that comes\nfrom nicotine itself or is there\nsomething about smoking maybe even\nvaping I don't know that um the\ncontaminants the other chemicals um in\ncigarettes or vape chemicals that\nincreases the stroke risk or is it\nnicotine itself it's not just nicotine\nnicotine is one of the factors but it's\nthe other uh products that are produced\nby by smoking that that can have an\neffect so given that so many fewer at\nleast Americans and I think worldwide um\npeople are smoking less uh are we seeing\nless\nstroke yes the the incidence of stroke\nis actually\ndecreasing um it may be in part due to\ndecreased smoking but it also is in part\ndue to other modifiable factors so\nhypertension is much better uh treated\nnow than it used to be\npeople take better care of themselves in\nterms of other lifestyle factors so\npeople uh exercise more there's a lower\nincidence in some subgroups of obesity\nthose are risk factors also for for for\ndeveloping strokes and as well as heart\nattack what is the relationship between\nheart health and brain health as it\nrelates to stroke uh I would imagine\nthat anything that's good for our heart\nis probably good for our brain brain um\ngiven the enormous amounts of blood and\nglucose that the uh the brain requires\nto function normally yeah it's a good\npoint in general uh the things that are\ngood for the heart are good for the\nbrain there there are differences\nbetween the heart and the Brain but uh\nthey they both uh depend very much on\nblood flow the brain's unique though\nbecause the brain represents only 2% of\nthe body weight yet it draws 15% of the\ntotal blood flow and remarkably it\nconsumes 20% of the body's\noxygen so the brain I still think the\nbrain is the most important organ uh not\nthe heart not the kidneys but I'm biased\nof course yeah you've spent some time in\nin uh in the landscape of the brain yeah\nit's it's clear that um of all the\ntissues in the body if you had to pick\none tissue to remove one you know cubic\nmillimeter of that tissue that your\nbrain and probably the neural retina\nwould be your your least uh favorite um\nchoice just given the deficits that can\nresult right and of course the brain\nalso is what makes us human right\nspeaking of which if we take a little\ndeparture into uh neurosurgery itself\nyour your specialty um of all the years\nof of doing brain surgery\num can you recall maybe one of the most\nincredible moments or days um that\nallowed for some insight into how the\nbrain works by virtue of let's say\nstimulating a given brain area or\nremoving a given brain area or or\nsomething of that sort I I asked this\nbecause um you know so very few of us\nwill ever have the opportunity to do\nwhat you do and if I were here talking\nto an astronaut and by the way I\nconsider neurosurgeons the astronauts of\nNeuroscience um if I were sitting here\nwith an astronaut I'd say you know tell\nme something interesting about being in\nspace that I wouldn't know from looking\nat pictures or videos of it what is an\nexample of maybe one of the more um\nprofound um Insight stimulating moments\num from doing brain surgery they're I\nmean every every patient is different so\nI'm always learning and that's why uh I\nstill enjoy it that it's a challenge uh\nand you have to think quickly um it's\nnot a it's not simply mechanical but for\ninstance a couple weeks ago uh I had a p\npatient who had a vascular\nmalformation which was located uh we\nthought right in her speech area so in\norder to operate safely uh first we did\na what's called a functional Mr scan\nbefore surgery and that gives us some\nidea of where the speech area is we can\nmap it out on an MR scan and the way\nit's mapped out is um we have the\npatient uh awake uh talk to us when they\ndo the scan\nand because there's a coupling between\nblood flow and and the neur neuronal\nactivity uh when the speech area the\nlanguage area is stimulated by\ntalking uh there's increased blood flow\nto that area and we can see that on an\nMR scan that's how the Mr scan works so\nwe had some idea that this was very\nclose if not in the speech area but the\nmost accurate way of determining that is\nto operate on the patient\nwith her awake so we took what we did\nwas we sedate the patient we don't put a\ntube down and induce general anesthesia\nwe numb up the scalp we take off a piece\nof bone after cutting the scalp open the\nmembrane covering the brain called the\ndura and then we allow the patient to\nwake up more from the\nsedation and then what I did on this\nparticular patient was to use a uh tiny\nstimulator\na little probe and I can stimulate areas\nof her cortex with her\nawake and see if the stimulation impairs\nher ability to speak or understand\nlanguage and quite\nsurprisingly there uh was no activity in\nthe corridor that I chose sometimes when\nwe see uh an area that is involved with\nspeech that's eloquent we have to choose\na different pathway way to get to the\nunderlying vascular problem and so\nthat's what we did in this case and um\nshe talked to us the entire case she\ntold us about her daughter uh who uh was\nuh very involved in um debate and all of\nher successes while we were operating\nwhile I was taking out this vascular\nmalformation uh under 20 magnification\nwith very special instruments I use a\nlaser now which has a diameter of the\nfiber optic cable uh the laser uh tip is\n0.5 millim so that I think is the\ngentlest way other times I've been\nsurprised um uh about brain function is\nuh operating deep in the brain there's a\npart of the brain called the brain stem\nwhich you know well it's a small area\nthat connects the thalmus those are the\nsignals coming from the cortex go\nthrough the thalmus to get down to the\nface arm and leg to move the muscles and\nall the sensory information which comes\nfrom the arms and the legs and face goes\nthrough the brain stem up to the thalmus\nand then to the\ncortex in this area although it's very\nsmall are contained uh very closely\npacked fiber tracks and nuclei those are\nthe cell bodies for very important\nneurons and when I trained back in the\n80s we never operated in that area\nbecause we couldn't do it\nsafely with developments in computer\ntechnology and imaging and anesthesia we\ncan now find safe corridors to get into\nthe brain stem and sometimes we\nstimulate for other Pathways not\nlanguage but other Pathways and I'm\ncontinually amazed um this last week I\ntook out um two vascular\nmalformations um and they're not big I\nmean they measure between\n8 mm and a centimeter but they can wreak\nhavoc in the brain stem because it's\nsuch high price real estate and these\nhad bled but I found a safe Corridor to\ngo through I took it out and I'm amazed\nthat you hardly set the patients back in\nsome cases because in the past we would\nhave clobbered the patients doing that\namazing yeah it's remarkable to me how\nmuch can be done now with imaging so\nvisualizing the brain and being able to\nTarget a specific location and you\nmentioned fiber Optic Cables I've also\nheard of things like the gamma knife and\nlasers so how much of neurosurgery\nnowadays is actually burrowing down\nthrough the brain to a given location to\nstimulate or remove tissue versus um you\nknow using these laser or Fiber Optic\napproaches to sort of triangulate and\nget to something without having to\nbasically drill down through the brain\nright neurosurgery is becoming much less\ninvasive and this is something that I\nreally tried to push when I was a chair\nof the department for 25 years at\nStanford um so minimally invasive\ntechniques\ninclude operating through the vessels\nright so now my I don't do this myself\nbut my colleagues some of whom are\nneurosurgeons some are Interventional\nradiologist they can go through the\ngroin in the femoral artery or through\nthe radial artery they can thread a\ncatheter\nbackwards into the brain from the groin\nthey can go up into the aorta up into\nthe kateed artery from there they can go\nup into the brain arteries the middle\ncerebral artery and they can treat some\nof the uh hemorrhagic problems like\naneurysms by deploying thrombogenic\ncoils there or new\ndevices they can pull clots out if\nthere's an acute stroke from a clot in\nan artery in the brain wow it it's\nreally it's really quite impressive um\nthen we've we and others have developed\ntechniques\nto use Focus\nradiation um on the brain and that's\ncalled radio surgery so examples of that\nare gamma knife um cyber knife was\ninvented at Stanford by one of my\ncolleagues actually and this uses uh\nbeams of radiation gamma knife uses a\nCobalt Source multiple uh sources of\ncobalt the cyber knife uses\nx-rays uh when I started I was very\ninvolved with using cyclotron generated\nheavy particles like helium and proton\nand they can be focused and the\nadvantage of this is you don't have to\nopen the skull you focus it on a very\nsmall area and you can eliminate um\nvascular malformations called\narterovenous malformations tumors you\ncan even use it for some pain conditions\nlike trigeminal neuralgia it's not\nrisk-free because even though radi ation\nis not is doesn't require opening the\nskull it Stills a form of energy that's\ndamaging that that's how it works it\ncauses for the avms it gradually clots\noff the blood vessels but it's much\neasier and much safer than some of the\ninvasive techniques that we use we\noperate now through tiny openings even\nwhen we do open surgery when I trained\nwe used to shave the whole head we would\nopen a huge area of the of the skull now\nwe operate through tiny a very small\nareas when I take out vascular\nmalformations uh in the brain stem for\ninstance uh I sometimes operate through\nopenings in the side of the brain stem\nthat are 2 to 3 millimeters wow um\nanother form of non-invasive uh\ntreatment that neurosurgeons use is\ncalled focused\nultrasound again it's you don't have to\nopen the skull it focuses uh sound waves\num on areas of the brain we're using\nthat to treat uh essential tremor MH or\num uh Parkinson's disease um it's\nstarting to be used for treating\ntumors so these are all advances that um\nwere not present when when I trained\nanother way of treating uh minimally\ninvasive although it still requires a\nhole in the head is to put in an\nelectrode and stimulate the brain so\nthat uh was first used for treating\nParkinson's disease very effective for\nmedically intractable Parkinson's it's\nused to treat chronic pain recently it\nwas shown to be beneficial uh for\nepilepsy in fact the two major trials\nprospective randomized trials that were\ndone uh were led by uh Physicians uh\nneurologists at Stanford and showed the\nbenefit of um stimulation of the brain\nto to treat a very difficult um epilepsy\nso this I think is going to be the\nfuture is minim more and more minimally\ninvasive in fact we're using some of\nthese techniques to even treat um\npsychiatric disorders like depression\nobsessive compulsive Behavior incredible\nI should have asked this earlier but um\nTia is transient es schic attacks um I\nthink most people assume or know that\nthe symptoms of stroke include you know\nsudden weakness maybe Hemi paralysis of\nthe face confusion Fusion slurring of\nthe words of course these symptoms can\nbe the consequence of other things as\nwell um what are some of the symptoms of\ntransient es schic attacks and is there\nanything that people can take for\ntransient es schic attacks and I of\ncourse would love for you to inform us\nuh what a transient esic attack is right\nso a transient esic attack or Tia is a\nreversible\nstroke uh it results in a temporary loss\nof function such as\nuh inability to move partial paralysis\nor complete paralysis but then it\nresolves uh inability to speak visual\nproblems double vision blurred vision\nloss of vision uh it can cause uh\nslurred speech uh or difficulty\nunderstanding language imbalance\nproblems walking even cognitive problems\nso it can vary depending on what part of\nthe brain it affects in the past it was\ndefined has a neurologic deficit due to\nlack of blood flow that lasted less than\n24 hours but now that we have such\nsophisticated Imaging like Mr scan some\nof these patients who have a TI what\nwould have been considered a TIA before\nlasting minutes or up to 24 hours on Mr\nscan have been shown to have a little\nstroke so now the definition is a little\ndifferent if there's an if you do an MR\nscan and it shows a new abnormality a\nnew stroke then it's called a stroke\nrather than a\nTIA um so there's a little overlap there\nbut it's a temporary um loss of of\nneurologic function due to lack of lack\nof blood flow or in in some cases a hemr\nmy understanding is that people can also\nhave strokes in their spinal cord um\nbecause spinal cord tissue is after all\ncentral nervous system tissue I think\nmost people don't realize this but the\nthe tail end of the brain the the brain\nstem as we're talking about before\nessentially extends down the uh the\nspinal column uh sort of like a a long\ntail right um uh uh down to the base of\nthe pelvis really um so we call it the\nspinal cord but it's all brain it's\ncontiguous with the brain so uh how\noften do You observe um spinal strokes\nand what are some of the symptoms of\nspinal stroke yeah it's much less common\num than uh a stroke involving the brain\nuh probably because there's less tissue\ninvolved uh the spinal cord is supplied\nby um an anterior spinal artery that's\nan artery on on on this side and by two\nso for those listening sorry it would be\nthe um sorry on the stomach side of of\nthe body yeah and it's supplied by two\narteries posterior spinal on the back\nside so if there's an interruption to\nblood flow in any of those arteries it\ncan cause death of tissue in the spinal\ncord and that would result in a\nneurologic deficit depending on where it\nis so if it occurred on the stomach side\nthat whole artery which supplies the the\n2third of the spinal cord um on the\nstomach side uh and it involved both\nsides of the spinal cord it would cause\na paralysis of both\nlegs and a partial sensory uh deficit\nwould call loss of pain and temperature\nbecause that's where those pathways are\nif the problem was on the backs side of\nthe cord it would cause a problem\npotentially with uh a light touch\nsensation in the legs um if it was below\nthe um it was in the below the cervical\nregion uh and U problems with what's\ncalled propri acception that's the\nability to recognize where uh your\nposition of your joints is so it depends\non where it is um some of the uh uh\nvascular problems I deal with actually\ndo involve the spinal cord and you can\ndevelop other problems there um for\ninstance you can have a direct\nconnection between a abnormal artery and\na vein in the spinal cord which doesn't\ncause a typical Stroke by blocking blood\nflow but it causes more of that Venus\nproblem we discussed where there's so\nmuch blood going directly from the\nartery to the vein bypassing the\ncapillaries that the veins become\nengorged the blood can't get out of the\nspinal cord and the spinal cord becomes\ncongested and patients can present with\nproblems uh walking or uh sensory\nproblems if the uh spinal cord is\ninvolved in the cervical region up high\nthen the arms can be involved as well I\nsee I should have asked this earlier but\nis there any relationship between\nalcohol intake and the propensity for\nstroke or Hemorrhage or any of these\nother things yeah that's a good question\nyes there is uh there there the uh\npeople who who indulge or\noverindulge uh uh are at risk for\ndeveloping um uh stroke problem so it's\nanother contribut contributory factor\nwhich can promote um problems with the\nwith the blood vessels um clots but also\nHemorrhage so it can make the blood\nvessels more fragile another factor I\nsee commonly um in patients who develop\naneurysms those are blisters on the\nblood vessels in the brain and they're\nlike little balloons and as they enlarge\nthey rupture just like a balloon can\nburst um some of the patients I see uh\nare not just smokers but indulge in uh\nother drugs so cocaine mam fetamines uh\nmarkedly increase the risk of developing\nthese aneurysms or develop veloping\nHemorrhage bursting of a blood vessel\nand is that because those drugs tend to\nincrease blood pressure during their use\num it's because they damage the\nvessels and they also can cause\nhypertension yes it's both factors so\nwhen I operate on uh on these patients\nand looking at the vessels um they are R\nthey're ragged they're very thin they're\nnot normal vessels they lack structural\nIntegrity so it contributes to the\ndevelopment of of poor vessel integrity\nand drugs like cocaine and\nmetamphetamine can jack the blood\npressure up uh and that could cause a\nhemorrhage in these these um problematic\nvessels yes so it sounds like the\nmessage is clear uh avoid cocaine use\navoid methamphetamine use and avoid\nexcessive alcohol intake if you want to\navoid stroke right and throw smoking in\nthere too it's interesting because for a\nlot of years there was so much\ndiscussion about red wine being good for\nheart health now it's debated the moment\nI say that people will send a bunch of\nstudies that say yes I my stance on the\nmore recent data is that if you had to\npick you'd drink less or not drink as\nopposed to drink um but I'm curious what\nyour take is on this well you know this\nis interesting and um I'm always quite\namazed at at um the way people change\ntheir behavior based on one study that\ncomes out even if it's a good study so\nyes it used to be um uh considered\nbeneficial if you drank red wine and\nthen for a while it a study showed any\nwine was beneficial in\nmoderation and um and that used to be\ntwo drinks a day for men one drink a day\nfor women and then the latest studies\nwhich have been surfacing this year\nsuggest no alcohol is good yeah but you\nknow next year it may be that we're back\nto oh you know wine is the best thing\nyou can do for your in moderation for\nyour your brain and heart health so it\nyeah It's Tricky my read of the data and\nhere I mean the data across multiple\ncertainly not every study but multiple\nstudies is that um zero to two drinks\nper week is seems to be the range that\neveryone agrees is safe at least for\nnon-alcoholic adults um and then once\nyou get out past two drinks per week is\nwhen gets into the gray Zone where some\npeople say it's good some people say\nit's neutral some people say it's bad\nbut that once you get up past you know\nfour or five servings of alcohol per\nweek\nit's pretty clear to me it's not a good\nsituation well that was the prevailing\nTheory until this year and I don't know\nif you've kept up but in the past you\nknow few months there have been several\narticles published saying um no wine no\nalcohol is good but then you have to\nbalance that against the fact that\nalcohol um for many people tends to\nrelieve stress so um you know if you're\nrelieving stress maybe it counteracts\nany adverse effect so complicated issue\nbut yeah my theory is um moderation is\nthe key to life uh and you know and uh\nhappiness also we know promotes\nlongevity yeah absolutely I I agree with\nyou I'm not heavy-handed about the\nalcohol thing I always just say you know\ndo as do as you wish but know what\nyou're doing um and I think many people\nwho heard our podcast episode about\nalcohol who stopped drinking alcohol or\nwho elected to drink less did so I'm\ntold um because they really didn't enjoy\nit that much to begin with so it more or\nless gave them permission to drink less\num not that they needed it but they took\nit uh anyway I think it's a really\ninteresting area as you mentioned it\nprobably lowers um stress it um probably\nalso disrupts patterns of sleep and they\ngot microbiome so there's you know you\nyou can't escape in biology there's\nalways some uh mod modulatory influence\non something else exactly I'd like to\ntake a brief break and acknowledge our\nsponsor a 1 by now most of you have\nheard me tell my story about how I've\nbeen taking ag1 once or twice a day\nevery day since 2012 and indeed that's\ntrue I started taking ag1 and I still\ntake ag1 once or twice a day because it\ngives me vitamins and minerals that I\nmight not be getting enough of from\nWhole Foods that I eat as well as\nadaptogens and micronutrients those\nadaptogens and micronutrients are really\ncritical because even though I strive to\neat most of my foods from unprocessed or\nminimally processed Whole Foods it's\noften hard to do so especially when I'm\ntraveling and especially when I'm busy\nso by drinking a packet of ag1 in the\nmorning and often times also again in\nthe afternoon or evening I'm ensuring\nthat I'm getting everything I need I'm\ncovering all of my foundational\nnutritional needs and I like so many\nother people that take ag1 regularly\njust report feeling better and that\nshouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\ndirected towards one specific outcome\nlike sleeping better or being more alert\nag1 really is foundational nutritional\nsupport it's really designed to support\nall of the systems of your brain and\nbody that relate to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman speaking of Lifestyle factors\num anytime we hear about traumatic brain\ninjury or concussion people immediately\nseem to think about football um but I'm\ntold by colleagues of ours in\nneurosurgery at Stanford and in\nneuroengineering that most head injuries\nare not from football they're not even\nfrom sport they're from construction\nwork accidents they're from car\naccidents what is your um take on you\nknow somebody let's say um God forbid\ngets rear ended in a in a car accident\nmaybe gets whip laap maybe they're\nfeeling a little off like maybe they\nhave a minor concussion maybe there was\nsome um movement of the brain that\nwasn't good what's the going consensus\non how to deal with that um sleep more\nbut then they tell you not to sleep\nexcessively um should people take blood\nthinning agents I mean obviously avoid\nalcohol or certainly don't get another\nhead injury anytime soon but you know\nwhat do we know about TBI and concussion\nthat that can help people move through\nthat period in the in the weeks and\nmonths afterwards where it's really\nscary you know if you've ever had a hard\nhead hit you know and they go they might\nscan you they might not see a bleed but\nit's it's kind of scary when you feel a\nlittle bit off because you've been\nhitting the head yeah it's a great\nquestion and there's a lot of\ninteresting concussion now um I got very\ninvolved in this back in the 90s CU I\nwas the 49ers\nneurosurgeon um for a decade from 1990\nto to 2000 how are they doing in that\npoint I remember the dynasty of the 80s\nthe '90s are good oh they they were\nsuper goal contention in fact uh I took\ncare of Steve Young yeah he's a local\nguy who yeah Steve's a great guy and\nSteve a really smart guy um uh in fact\nhe has a a a law law degree from uh\nBrigham uh young uh Steve was\nquarterback then and they were in Super\nBowl contention and uh Steve had had\nsome uh concussions and um I actually\nsent him back to play when he recovered\nso you can examine someone\num uh and get a decent idea of how\nthey're recovering from a concussion uh\nSteve unfortunately had a a a bad\nconcussion at one point and um he ended\nup retiring which was the smartest thing\nI think uh for him in the end and he's\nbecome very involved with um studying\nconcussions and and uh trying to figure\nout better ways to um to diagnose them\nuh prevent the sequella for football\nplayers including uh changes in\nequipment and and and in in uh tackling\nand that kind of thing um but concussion\nis we've learned a lot since the 1990s\nat that time uh concussion um was not\nknown even repeated concussion to cause\nCTE chronic traumatic enopi in football\nplayers CTE which became a hot topic was\nknown only in boxers so I became very\nwell informed at the time about uh\nconcussions and there was surprisingly\nlittle known um soccer players had a\nhigh incidence of concussion uh at that\ntime it wasn't known if there were\nlong-term sella and usually there are\nnot long-term sequella um as long as you\ndon't get repeated concussions um so um\nnow what we generally recommend uh if\nsomeone has a concussion um we usually\nget an MR scan if if it's severe Mr\nscans usually don't show anything they\nwould show a contusion if there's any\nbruising of the brain but um they don't\nshow the the the molecular um\nabnormalities that occur with the\nconcussion so the best way to um figure\nout how severe it is and when a when a\nperson has recovered is to do more\nsophisticated neurologic testing uh eye\ntracking is a very sensitive way um to\nto to to detect problems with um with\nthe brain after a concussion because you\nwon't track as well and in fact many\nsports uh football hockey uh are\nincorporating um pre-season ey tracking\ntesting I see to get a baseline to get a\nbaseline of course some of the players\nwill um game the system because they\nstill don't want to be taken out so they\nmay try to perform not as well as they\nthey could on their eye track yeah on\ntheir see they throw the test they throw\nthe test so their Baseline is I mean you\nknow I don't think that's very common\nbut that's a way you can game the system\nbut uh as long as it's performed well\nthat's a very good way uh of of\ndetecting um subtle problems with the\nbrain well you're a vision scientist so\nyou understand how important um uh all\nthe circuits are um in terms of and the\nvisual system is unique because it tests\nuh the brain from the\nretina all the way back to the occipital\nso it's the whole longitudinal access of\nthe brain that's being tested yeah I'm\nalways struck by when I see these News\nNews Real highlights of you know a\nplayer goes down they stay down um and\nthen you know they're helped up and\neveryone cheers and then they might\nhobble off take a few moments and then\nyou know how are they gauging the\ndecision to put the person back in and\nthe reason it's per in to me how they\nwould determine that is that you and I\nboth know that the neurons the nerve\ncells in the brain very likely um could\nbe injured maybe even on their way to\ndeath after a head injury but that the\nactual dying off of the tissue could\ntake several minutes hours maybe even\ndays so putting someone back in to get\nhit more um seems really risky but at\nthe same time that's their profession\nthat's their choice and so you don't\nnecessarily want to make the decision to\ntake someone out of a game or a job um\nor have them stop driving if they don't\nactually need to stop so it's a tricky\nthing it is tricky and I think we have\nbetter uh methods of uh even at the if\nyou're talking about sports on the\nsideline of doing testing um there are\nneurosurgeons there now uh who are part\nof the process um uh as far as\nrecovering uh in general it's good to\nnot stress the brain but uh total\nabsence of sensory you know uh\ninformation sensory deprivation for long\nperiods is not a good idea right just\nstaying home in the dark with sunglasses\non also not a good idea exactly so you\nwant to make sure the brain still has\ninput but you don't want to um\noverstress it when you recovering from a\nconcussion sounds like doing all the\nthings to keep blood pressure relatively\nlow um LDL cholesterol relatively low so\ninteresting what you said earlier that\nstatins might be vascular protective\neven in the absence of high cholesterol\nyeah there's a lot of good evidence for\nthat in fact some Studies have suggested\nthat taking statins reduces the risk of\ncognitive decline including conditions\nlike Alzheimer's interesting I know that\nstatens are a bit of a controversial\ntopic um among listeners because some\npeople um report I think I have this\nright that statens can give them a kind\nof a brain fog if they take the wrong\none or excessive amounts uh yeah it it\nI'm not challenging what you're saying I\njust I just hear the sh the in the\ncomment section and I'm just I don't\ntake a Statin but my cholesterol is in\ncheck um but I'm hearing more and more\nabout some of these benefits of\nstatins yeah yeah and the the\ninformation is still emerging for a\ntraumatic brain injury in general you\nnot a good idea to take uh an aspirin as\nopposed to a stroke or a TIA where you\nwould want to take an aspirin right\nbecause if you have injury say you have\na contusion to the brain and there's\nsome uh some traumatic damage taking a\nblood thinner might cause that to worsen\nor cause a hemorrhage what about\ncaffeine is there any evidence that\ncaffeine can increase stroke or resum me\nI like coffee and I like uh yate tea so\nI'd be reluctant to give it up but I\nconsume it in moderation is there any\ndirect relationship there I don't know\nany relationship unless it unless you're\ntaking so much that your blood pressure\nis Skyhigh my blood pressure tend lots\nof benefits uh um evidently to to\ncaffeine in terms of of Health\nyeah I agree with you there um have a\nquestion about something that many\npeople are starting to do now which is\nto get um exploratory MRI I actually did\none of these um I wasn't gifted one I\njust decided to bite the bullet and pay\nfor it is a whole body scan they put me\nin the tube did a MRI get everything\nfrom tip to toe um and I learned a few\nthings I learned that I have like a\nslight I think it's L3 or L4 disc bulge\nthat explained a little bit of like\npseudo sciatica and I've been able to\nwork around that um and keep that strong\nI learned that fortunately for me I only\nhave one white spot on the brain I was\ntold that you could have one per decade\nI'm nearing 50 so I feel very lucky\nthere especially given that I've hit my\nhead a few times skateboarding and doing\nmartial arts and things like that but um\nso I feel lucky but I also know people\nthat go in for these scans and get the\nreport that you know they have a um a\ngrowth of some sort or they have\nmultiple white spots as they're called\non the brain which is kind of damage to\nto tissue to neural tissue you know what\nis your thought on these um exploratory\nSL preventative scans do you think\nthey're useful um do you feel like they\ncause undue concern I mean this is a new\nthing people going out and getting their\nbrain scanned yeah and people are\ngetting total body scans so I think\nthere are benefits and risks involved so\nthe benefit is that you might pick up uh\nsomething that should be treated like an\nearly cancer uh or a large aneurysm in\nthe brain which would have a higher\ntendency to bleed but many times and I\nsee patients all the time who are\nreferred for a tiny\naneurysm um blister on a blood vessel in\nthe brain that was found incidentally on\na total body scan and these aneurysms\nwhich can be one or two\nmillimeters sometimes we don't even\nconsider those as real\naneurysms um they don't need to be\ntreated in most cases\num and so it's uh it's a little\ncontroversial because people can be\nworried about them even if they're\nreassured other examples are you find\nsomething in the brain or elsewhere in\nthe body not sure what it is and then in\norder to determine what it is patients\nstart having more invasive biopsies and\ntests which can lead to what we call\niatrogenic injuries that's iatrogenic is\ncaused by the\nPhysicians so uh I think you have to be\nvery thoughtful when when you interpret\nthe results of of these um total body or\nor or even brain scans and um I would\nrecommend talking with a specialist\nabout it um if if if you're concerned\nbut um you know people wonder I have\nthis uh we were discussing it earlier\ntoday actually um with one of your\ncolleagues and what if you're found to\nhave a 1.75 millimeter aneurysm if it's\nreally even an\naneurysm should you change your\nlifestyle and for something like that I\nwould recommend no you should forget\nabout it get a follow-up scan but you\nmay very well live and die with with\nthis little blister that is of no\nconsequence so uh as I say I I think you\nhave to be careful about how you\ninterpret and and how you uh act on on\nthese uh findings maybe we can talk\nabout lifestyle factors because I think\nanyone listening to this is going to\nthink I don't want a stroke I don't want\ntransient es schic attack I don't want\nHemorrhage I don't want any of this\nstuff and we already discussed a little\nbit about how what's good for your heart\ngenerally is good for the brain but you\nknow I think most people strive to eat\nwell meaning not excessively also not\nundereat um to hopefully eat a lot of\nunprocessed or minimally processed foods\nand to avoid smoking perhaps um avoid\nalcohol in excess avoid hard drugs um\nget exercise um and so you know I think\npeople generally try and do all these\nthings get good sleep Etc um but at some\nlevel I think everyone also wants to\nknow like when are they in their safest\num kind of shape for avoiding a stroke\nis is there sort of a blood pressure cut\noff where we could say okay you know if\nyou keep your blood pressure resting\nblood pressure below blank you're doing\npretty well um and if your cholesterol\nis below blank you're doing pretty well\nand then you just you know while keeping\nmoderation uh in mind try and live a\nlife that um you know reduces the\nprobability of getting a stroke or a or\nsome other you know blood related neural\nattack well I think it has to be\nindividualized to some extent and um\nover time the standards and the\nguidelines have changed it used to be if\nyou're systolic blood pressure that's\nthe upper number was under 130 130 or\nunder that was considered normal and and\nwould not lead to problems now the\nguidelin suggests that 120 or lower is\nbetter in large you know\nstudies but um as an example uh when my\nblood pressure gets under\n120 I feel lightheaded in fact I had an\nevent uh about 15 years ago when I was\noverdoing it like I shouldn't have been\noverdoing exercise\novering everything I was in my I was\nStanford faculty member that over that\nwas a joke that among Stanford faculty I\nwas 56 and I operated all day in two\noperating rooms um I got done early um\nit was in the spring and I took a run up\nto the dish and then I took a red eye to\nHouston for a meeting and I emailed on\nthe flight got an hour or two asleep\nwent to the meeting was fine uh it was a\nstroke meeting with a bunch of\nscientists uh neurologists and\nscientists there were about 120 people\nthere were two neurosurgeons there plus\nme and um drank some coffee at noon I\nwent for a run cuz I like running and in\nhu at that day in Houston it was um 90°\nand 85% humidity and got back had a\nglass of um tea went back to the meeting\nhad some more coffee and then as the\nafternoon session opened up I started to\nfeel lightheaded and um next thing I\nknow I'm looking up at the chandelier\nand they're they're they're shouting um\nstroke Cardiac Arrest seizure and\nthey're starting to pump on my chest so\nthey rushed me to the hospital where I\nhad uh a simultaneous workup for cardiac\narrest and\nstroke and after um I'll make the story\nshort after uh a $100,000 workup it was\ndetermined I had a\nfaint because I was overdoing it so\nsince then I now I try to get seven to\neight hours sleep at night that's\nclearly the Bedrock of health so I\nincreased I used to get three to five\nhours sleep at night now I get 7 to nine\nif I can do it uh cut back on on on\ncoffee on caffeine and um uh I don't\npush myself to exercise like I used to\nI'm feeling a fatigued I'm on an\nanti-hypertensive agent but I actually\ndon't take it every day because um for\nme it's better to have a pressure 125 to\n135 and it's true for some of my\npatients if you've got some disease in\nyour arteries you may not want to have\nsuch a low blood pressure so I would\nindividualize it but in general um you\nwant to take care of your body like I've\nlearned and probably maybe you've\nlearned over time I'm learning I mean\nthis is very interesting I've I tend to\nhave low blood pressure it s of runs in\nmy family to have low blood pressure um\nI can definitely relate to the um hard\ndriving um ambition phenotype I think\nit's it's worth people hearing this\nbecause it's characteristic of a lot of\npeople in high-intensity professions and\nI made the joke about Stanford faculty\nbut um it's true I think that if you're\nambitious you tend to overdo a bit more\nthat's something I'm certainly working\non and I've um run a very busy life and\nlearning to slow down prioritize sleep\nprioritize meditation non-sleep deep\nrest is something I've benefited from a\nlot journaling things of that sort that\nreally just kind of slow the pace I\nthink that um you know in the landscape\nof Health optimization we can often put\nourselves into modes of excess in the\nother direction um meaning doing so much\nto try and avoid uh issues with health\nthat we end up creating issues with\nhealth but yeah certainly reducing\ncaffeine intake and prioritizing sleep\nare key so that I appreciate that you\nshared that story so if somebody has\nnaturally low blood pressure and starts\nto feel a bit um let's just say kind of\nsleepy or woozy in the afternoon would\nyou recommend um that they obviously not\ntake a a um pressure lowering drug but\nthat they add a bit of salt to their\ndiet that they um feel free to um you\nknow to to exercise less I'm a little\nbit confused I I also love to run and\nand do resistance I would recommend they\ntake their blood pressure so um you want\nto try to correlate any symptoms you're\nhaving with vital signs that you modify\nright so take your blood pressure if\nyou're feeling faint if it's low uh one\nthing you can do uh easily is to hydrate\nthat was something else I used to not\ndrink much because I don't want to have\nto pee in the operating room I can\nimagine that' be pretty uncomfortable I\ndon't want to be the patient that you're\noperating on when you have to go use the\nbathroom yeah so now and then uh I'll\nreveal that I um had a kidney stone\nwhich is common among surgeons uh this\nwas a decade ago and since then uh I\nhydrate all the time so I hydrate to the\npoint that my urine is crystal clear all\nthe time and that helps with some of the\nbrain Clarity so interesting I've done a\nlittle bit of work with people in the\nSpecial Operations community and you\nknow I think people hear about them and\nthey think oh you know what's what's the\nmagic potion that they're taking what\nare they doing and they do a number of\nvery interesting things um but one of\nthem is they really emphasize hydration\nthey just like hydration water sometimes\nwater with electrolytes if they're\nworking in in in hot conditions just\nhydration hydration hydration skeptical\num and I used to dehydrate I felt better\ndehydrated and fit you know but um as\nI've matured um I think it's very very\nimportant um and uh for you know for for\nyour blood pressure for your General\nHealth uh and for your kidneys Yeah you\nmentioned sleep um is there a\nrelationship between sleep deprivation\nand stroke\nrisk uh that's a great question there's\ninterestingly um Strokes occur more\ncommonly during\nsleep it's not known why one theory is\nthat it's related to sadian\nrhythms um I don't know if there's a\nrelationship between sleep\ndeprivation and and um and stroke I'd\nlike to take a brief break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need that means the\nelectrolyte sodium magnesium and\npotassium in the correct amounts and\nratios and nothing you don't which means\nno sugar now I and others on this\npodcast have talked about the critical\nimportance of hydration for proper brain\nand body functioning even a slight\ndegree of dehydration can diminish\ncognitive and physical performance it's\nalso important that you get adequate\nelectrolytes the electrolytes sodium\nmagnesium and pottassium are critical\nfor the functioning of all the cells in\nyour body especially your neurons your\nnerve cells drink element dissolved in\nwater makes it very easy to ensure that\nyou're getting adequate hydration and\nadequate electrolytes to make sure I'm\ngetting proper amounts of hydration and\nelectrolytes I dissolve one packet of\nelement in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I'll also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\nin hot days when I'm sweating a lot\nlosing water and electrolytes they have\na bunch of different great tasting\nflavors of element my favorite is the\nwatermelon although I confess I also\nlike the raspberry and the Citrus\nbasically I like all the flavors and\nelement has also just released a new\nline of canned sparkling element so\nthese aren't the packets you dissolve in\nwater these are cans of element that you\ncrack open like any other canned drink\nlike a soda but you're getting your\nhydration and your electrolytes with no\nsugar if you'd like to try element you\ncan go to drink element spelled l\nmn.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with a purchase of any\nelement drink mix again that's drink\nelement.com huberman to claim a free\nsample pack I'm going to tell a horror\nstory but not I want to repeat not to\ndemonize chiropractors here here's the\npositive story I had a back thing that\nmy back hurt and I wasn't sure what I\nneeded to do and a\nchiropractor um gave me some exercises\nto do that essentially were like the up\ndog movement in yoga that my\nunderstanding is it helped the the disc\nbulge to kind of work its way back into\nthe spinal column and it worked\nterrifically well I took no medic\nmedication I required no surgery and I\neventually learned to correct some\nimbalances that have led me to not have\nthat issue again it was really\nremarkable and this chiropractor\nessentially um saved me from surgery and\nand I'm forever grateful so there I\nthink there are excellent chiropractors\nout there um but when I was a postto uh\nliving in San Francisco I had a roommate\nI believe she was a neurology resident\nand she came back from the clinic at\nUCSF and she told me this story that a\npatient had come in who was experiencing\nsome Hemi paralysis of the face that\npatient I believe it was a young woman\num had gone for a neck adjustment or\nhead adjustment at a car up with a\ndissection of her artery right and\nsomething had happened and she had\nessentially a stroke yes and so I I\nshare both these stories to make very\nclear that I have nothing um against\nchiropractors but I think like any\nhealth practitioners they come in a\nrange of talents um uh and this was\nreally like for me uh um an alarm and I\ndecided at that point I would never\nallow a chiropractor to adjust my neck I\nsaid okay you can you can make\nadjustments to my back you can give me\nsuggestions about exercises to do but\nhow common are these um this uh you said\nit's a hemi dissection um it it's a\ndissection of an artery either the uh\nvertebral artery in the back or the\ncored artery up closer um in the front\nso no cutting when you say dissection\nthey're Mak basically making an\nadjustment yeah well what happens is um\nand I agree with I we're on the same\npage I recommend patients if they're\ngoing to have chiropractor not to have\nmanipulation of their neck because\nthat's what occurs it's not common but\nuh I see it we see it what happens is\nthe artery is damaged um the\nmanipulation of moving the bone and the\nsoft tissues causes a tear in the wall\nof the artery and and what occurs\ninterestingly is that the blood that's\nusually in the space the Lumen the\nmiddle of the artery gets into the wall\nand causes a false Lumen a false passage\nand that that blood in the wall pushes\npart of the wall into the the main\nartery obstructing\nflow and sometimes causing a clot to\nform that can be dislodged and go up to\nthe brain\nyikes so and there's no way to know\nwhether or not this is going to happen\nno that's why I recommend not having uh\nneck manipulation by a chiropractor even\nif it's rare um it's it's so devastating\nwhen it occurs that uh personally I I I\nwould avoid that um yes I tell the\nchiropractor uh stay away from anything\num above the shoulders please um and\nthen the back work has been beneficial\nagain these exercis is perhaps the most\nbeneficial thing about it um as long as\nwe're there I realize it's a bit of a\nniche condition but what about hanging\nupside down I had one of these inversion\ntables I really enjoyed that thing but\nthen once I looked at my camera phone\nwhile I was hanging upside down and it\nlooked like I was going to blow a gasket\nfrom all the vasculature in my forehead\nis it bad to hang upside down no\nevidence that it's bad oh good oh good\nmaybe I'll get an inversion table again\num as long as you don't stay there of\ncourse you had some okay great um would\nyou let your kids play football or rugby\nthat's a great question I would not uh\nthat's my personal decision I think\nthere are a lot of benefits to um\nchildren playing uh football rug like\nany sport uh it's a team sport a lot of\ngood skills are learned um besides the\nyou know just the the the physicality of\nit the coordination uh but being a team\nplayer and the\nsocialization but uh I think talking\nabout tackle football um uh I think um\nthe risk there is still risk we're just\nlearning about it and even um high\nschool players who who um uh many years\nago were found to have multiple\nconcussions are showing up when they\nwhen they're doing autopsies uh uh with\nsome of this uh chronic traumatic\nR for injuries not just head injuries\nother injuries um my son who's a very\ngood athlete he played four years of\nHigh School uh baseball and soccer was\nasked to try out uh for the quarterback\nposition his senior year and we went out\nto try out but and he decided um you\nknow with my encouragement not not not\nto play did he go to gun high school he\nwent to meno okay I went to gun our\nfootball team was at that time was bad\nenough that there was no incen to play\nwhat about soccer and heading the ball\nI've actually heard that can be\nproblematic which to me at first when I\nheard that I I was like no there's no\nway I mean the ball is so light but is\nthere any evidence that repeated you\nknow heading there is it's again it's\nit's it's not uh uh incontrovertible but\num uh there is some evidence that\nmultiple headings can can cause some\nsome concussions and some long-term\ninjury um again when I studied this in\ndetail um as a 49ers uh neurosurgeon\nback in the 90s there was very little\ndata although there was some evidence\neven then that soccer players had a uh\nHigh incidence uh particularly female\nsoccer players had a high incidence of\nof concussion\nsurprisingly uh but now there's much\nmore evidence that head injuries and\neven heading the ball may lead to some\nyou know some some some injury I feel\nlike if a sport is not your profession\nthe risk benefit analysis is pretty\nclear like like like why box I\nunderstand it's a great sport there's a\nlot to learn there um done a little bit\nof it in the past but but unless you're\ngoing to get paid substantial amounts of\nmoney and maybe even then it's probably\nnot worth it well I feel the same way um\nit is different for professional\nathletes I mean this is their job um you\nknow I remember talking with with Steve\nYoung at one point about you know\ncontinuing to play or you know finally\ndeciding to retire and uh I was thinking\nwhat if you know I was asked to retire\nas a neurosurgeon at the prime of my\ncareer um you know uh it's your\nprofession it's your income it's your\nyou know it's how you identify yourself\num you know uh your self-esteem is\ndependent on it your family maybe put\npressure on you as a professional\nathlete um if you're not a professional\nathlete I I think for me and this is my\nmy own opinion individually I think um\nthere's less of a controversy and what\nthere's so many other sports which uh uh\nbenefit in the same way um as as\nfootball or or boxing um why not why not\nyou know participate in those that's my\nfeeling but I know it's a controversial\nsubject yeah um maybe we can Circle back\na little bit on a a fairly common\nscenario\num you're in the attic and you're\nlooking for something you stand up boom\nyou hit your head on a beam and you know\nkind of dizzy for a bit or recently our\npodcast team was on tour in Australia\nand the way that the the uh shelf over\nthe kitchen sink and our um Airbnb was\narranged it was certain that everyone\npretty much would hit their head hard on\nthat thing at some\npoint does one need to worry about one\nkind of dizzy inducing head hit um from\neveryday life you know I think a lot of\npeople are kind of scared like do they\ndo brain damage or is the The\nevolutionary adaptation which is the\nthick skull um sufficient to you know\nkeep us safe in most cases I don't think\nyou need to worry in general especially\nif your symptoms resolve within a\nrelatively short period of time such as\nhow long a day or two yeah I mean you\nknow even if you have a mild concussion\nand you recover within a day or two I\ndon't think there's uh any need to worry\nor get a scan or uh and and it's a\ncommon place Place occurrence yeah I\nthink um your answer will set a lot of\nMinds at ease because um people do worry\nI mean there's something so mysterious\nabout the stuff that occurs inside the\ncranial Vault we can't look to something\nwe can't you know take our pulse um it's\njust you know it's so hard to know\nwhat's going on in there well as you say\nthat's why we develop very thick skulls\nto protect the the most important organ\nbecause after all the tissue doesn't\nregenerate um at least not much of it\nthere are a few areas where there where\nthere neurons that can replenish you\nknow I'm going to take um issue with you\nat that because the the prior notion of\ncourse was that once nerve cells in the\nbrain die they don't regenerate and for\na long time it was thought you don't\nproduce any any new nerve cells any new\nstem cells in the brain um and we used\nto think after an injury uh or uh a\ndisease like a stroke when that tissue\nwas damaged and you were paralyzed or\nyou couldn't talk that there was no way\nto recover that those circuits were were\ndead uh it turns out that is not true\nand we are learning that I think in\nrecent years um when I trained there was\nno hope to restore function in patients\nwho had a stroke traumatic brain injury\nspinal cord injury uh uh and um other\ndiseases uh ALS lugar's disease um\nParkinson's disease now we are learning\nlearning that uh there is hope we know\nthat stem cells do form in the adult\nbrain that's not controversial anymore\nwe know that other circuits can take\nover for circuits that were dead um and\nwe know now and this is some of the work\nthat we're doing with chronic stroke\npatients who we thought could not\nrecover after 6 months at all we know\nthat there are ways of um promoting uh\nregeneration or recovery of function\nwe're still working out the details of\nthat but um for instance we've done\nstudies and this is still in um clinical\ntrial phase with patients who are years\nout from a stroke they've been through\nrehab uh they've been through physical\ntherapy and 90% or more of recovery\nafter a stroke occurs in the first 6\nmonths after that time you know patients\nare not going to recover\nand now we are finding in some of our\nearly trials with patients that if you\nfor instance put in stem cells into the\nbrain uh or um if you another treatment\nwhich was uh approved by the FDA the\nvery first for chronic stroke if you put\na stimulator on the vagus nerve in the\nneck and\nstimulate coupled with physical therapy\nintensive Physical Therapy you can\nimprove arm function in those patients\nin our patients that we've treated in\nmultiple trials we're seeing early\nindications that patients years out from\na\nstroke can start to recover function in\ntheir arms in their legs in their\nspeech and we don't know all the\nmechanisms but the old notion that these\ncircuits are dead is simply not true\nthey can be\nresurrected and so um you know this is\npart of the the the excitement about um\nDiscovery and um doing research and\ntrying to translate into the clinical\nArena yeah oftentimes this boils down to\nreally critical of the- moment decisions\nI'll tell a story um I won't reveal the\nthe hospital or the the exact players\ninvolved but um some years ago an\nex-girlfriend of mine um who then was\njust somebody I was uh friends with um\nslash dating contacted me and said that\nher dad had had a stroke and I was um\nnear that hospital so I went um and\nspoke to the resident and the resident\nwho was overseeing the case essentially\nsaid look it's hopeless there's a huge\nnecrotic piece of tissue in there um the\nprobability of any kind of quality of\nlife is essentially zero my suggestion\nand I was there as as um the resent made\nthe suggestion would be to remove him\nfrom life support essentially and um the\nother members of the family were like oh\nmy goodness right this is not a\nsituation anyone wants to be in um I\nmade a couple of calls including to um\nsomeone who's previously been a guest on\nthis uh podcast who's highly qualified\nto know about this sort of thing they\nasked a couple of questions about the\nlocation of the stroke which side of the\nbrain it was on and said um keep him\nalive there's a good chance that he'll\nhave um some degree of recovery of\nfunction so that's what they did and\nindeed um while he lost some motor um\nabilities um lost some speech abilities\nand has some disrupt of affect where\nhe'll sort of spontaneously laugh or cry\nfrom time to time he has at least by my\nobservation been able to enjoy\nsubstantial amounts of Life interacting\nwith grandkids um enjoying holidays and\nactually took I was told some um some\nphysical steps at some point with\nassistance with a walker gone done a lot\nof physical rehab um obviously a really\nhard situation but it told me that often\ntimes when we think that All Is Lost not\nAll Is Lost even in people in their 70s\nright it it has to do with\nplasticity and um we all wish we were\nneonates or infants because um the body\nincluding the brain is so plastic that's\nthe ability to regenerate tissue and\ncircuits and recover so if an infant has\na stroke and is paralyzed on one side\nusually they can make an excellent if\nnot complete recovery um this is the as\nI recall from my undergraduate years the\nKenard principle if you're going to have\na brain injury have it early in life\nexactly so um I mean you notice this too\nwhen I cut myself now it can take a week\nfor that cut to heal when my\ngranddaughter who's six years old cuts\nherself the next day it's totally healed\nso little kids are like salamanders\nright they almost it's by the way that\nwas a biology joke they're not like\nsalamanders that but um salamanders can\nre uh regenerate entire limbs by the\nmaintenance of a small stem cell\npopulation at the at the tip of the the\nlimb bud\num or what would be the limb Bud um and\nit is remarkable how kids can regenerate\nwithout a scar they can often times they\ncan't grow an entire hand back but it's\nkind of striking how much plasticity\nthere is and that's what we're trying to\ndevelop are new ways of promoting\nplasticity in the adult brain as an\nexample so we think stem cells injected\nthrough various mechanisms stimulation\nof the brain or the vagal nerve as an\nexample can prom remote plasticity in a\nsense we think what's happening is um\nthat these methods can turn the adult\nbrain into an infant brain in some ways\nwhere are the stem cells coming from in\nthese experiments it depends um there\nare different sources so um some of the\nstudies I've done previously with other\ncompanies uh they made the stem cells\neither from uh bone marrow\ndonors so they were meenal\nor uh another group made the cells from\nuh from fetal uh neural tissue okay so\njust to orient people inside the bone\nyou have the marrow most people know\nthat um because they've ordered it at a\nrestaurant um cow marrow that is um uh\ntypically um the cells within the marrow\num contain as I recall a hemopoetic\npopulation so a population of of sort of\npotential blood cells you know cells\nthat can become blood cells or other\nthings and if taken out put into a petri\ndish and given the appropriate factors\nyou can drive the fate of those stem\ncells to be say neurons or cardiac cells\nand then you're taking those cells and\nyou're injecting them into the brains of\npatients in the hopes that they will re\nbecome neural cells neurons that will\nincorporate into the circuitry actually\nthat was the initial notion 20 years ago\nwhen we started doing this was that\nthese cells you put in uh become these\nexogenous cells you inject become\nneurons and asites and alod dendrites\nall the cells in the brain and that the\nneurons reconstitute circuits that is\nnot how they work the way they work and\nthis is why it may not uh matter what\nparticular type of stem cell you put in\nthe way they work primarily is by\nsecreting very powerful proteins\nmolecules growth factors that promote\nnative\nrecovery so they promote angiogenesis\nthey promote native neurogenesis\nendogenous gliogenesis\nsynaptogenesis but the main benefit may\nbe that they modulate the immune system\nthat's what we're finding so by\nmodulating somehow the immune system in\nthe\nbrain they are able to induce plasticity\nand recover function interesting I I'm\ntempted here to weave in the the stories\nthat date back to the90s but that we see\nmore and more of mostly studies in\nrodents but a few in humans showing that\nthere are dormant stem cell populations\nin certain compartments of the brain the\nDage Gus of the hippocampus the olda\nfactory Bulb Etc that upon hyper\noxygenation or increasing blood flow to\nthe brain largely by virtue of exercise\nbut also sometimes by way of engaging in\nlearning tasks and exercise that you can\nbasically cause the release of stem\ncells that normally would lie DM\nis that um literature reason enough to\nsuggest that people who've had a stroke\num continue to move their body to walk\nget exercise maybe do resistance\ntraining maybe even some skill related\ntraining yes there's a lot of evidence\nthat um activity Physical Therapy even\nforced activity um is very beneficial\nand it's not just um stimulating\nendogenous stem cells in the brain but\nit's multiple mechanisms uh it's\nrecruiting uh circuits that were not\ninvolved before for instance Studies\nhave been done on stroke patients who\nmake a recovery show that um not only is\nthe side of the stroke improving in some\ncases but the other side of the brain is\nshowing increased\nactivity so circuits on the other side\nof the brain may be contributing to the\nrecovery on the the side of the stroke\nbrain so it's much more complex than we\nthought it was years ago I um developed\nan affection for a literature it wasn't\na very prominent literature um but I\nfound it really interesting um is the\nwork of a guy named Timothy Scher and um\nTeresa Jones I yeah I know you familiar\nwith this yeah we almost recruited to to\nto our department yeah the sort of\noverarching theme of this literature was\nit was animal work um but I think some\nof it might have been translated to\nhumans which was that for instance if\nsomebody has damage on one side of the\nbrain\nuh because of the way the circuits are\norganized and of course you know this\nbetter than anyone uh Gary but that one\nmight experience deficits in limb\nmovement on the opposite side and that\nthe tendency for somebody like that is\nto then over rely on the intact limbs um\nessentially lean on the the intact Limbs\nand the approach that they took to try\nand uh recover function was really\ninteresting they had these animals and I\nthink eventually there was some human\nwork done I could be mistaken to um sort\nof uh tie up the the more active\nuninjured arm or leg or hand such that\nthey then had had to rely on the\nnon-dominant or let's just call it\ninjured sometimes even flaccid paralysis\nLimb and in that way they could generate\na lot of plasticity that normally would\nescape the patient especially in the\ndays and weeks following the injury just\nforcing movement uh or forcing the\nattempt to move of the injured pathway I\nfind this literature to be so striking\nand maybe one that should deserve more\nattention yeah it's called constraint\ntherapy and um not only has it been\nshown in uh animal studies preclinically\nbut it's been shown in some uh clinical\nstudies of patients with stroke in fact\none of the trials we did with\ntransplanting stem cells into the brain\nincluded restraining the good limb to\nforce use of the other limb so there's\num some very intriguing data suggesting\nthat that's important however some of\nthe animal studies also suggest that you\nmay have to wait a time if you force use\nof the uh involved limb too soon it can\nbe detrimental to the recovery I see so\nthere may be a a an important temporal\nFactor there in terms of the timing of\nwhen you do that is there anything that\npeople can do or take for\nneuroprotection after an injury to\nessentially try and rescue neurons that\nwould otherwise die right so this is a a\nvery interesting subject um back in the\nlate 1980s\n1990s a lot of emphasis was placed on\ntrying to protect the brain against\nacute stroke different pharmacologic\nagents were tried um probably\num a thousand different drugs were tried\nwhich\nblocked uh the pathway leading to cell\ndeath so interestingly when you deprive\nthe the brain and the neurons of oxygen\nand glucose they don't die\nimmediately and it takes some time and\nit's actually an active process so the\nrelease\nof these excitatory amino acids occurs\nso normally as you know glutamate\naspartate are important\nneurotransmitters in the brain and you\nneed them to function but after a stroke\nwhen there's a deprivation of oxygen and\nglucose and a mismatch between the\nmetabolism and the supply of oxygen and\nglucose for some reason there's a\nrelease of these excitatory amino acids\nlike glutamate and that causes an influx\nof calcium into the neurons which is the\nfinal common Pathway to\ndying and then there are other Pathways\nthat can that lead to release of free\nradical and uh which are more damaging\nand those can cause another type of cell\ndeath called apoptotic cell death that's\na cell death that occurs and requires\nprotein synthesis and then uh with\nreperfusion um say the artery opens up\nthen you got a lot of inflammation so\nthese pharmacological treatments as I\nsay a thousand of them were tried um and\nthey were found to be very effective in\npre-clinical stroke models so we could\ncure stroke in the lab my lab studied\nthis for probably 15 years and um you\nknow there was no doubt we could cure\nstroke if we got the drugs on board even\nafter the stroke um within a few\nhours but it never was able to be\ntranslated to the clinical Arena except\nfor one case so besides drugs that were\ntried um another method of protecting\nthe brain was tried called mild\nhypothermia\nand that uh was a process of reducing\nthe brain temperature and body\ntemperature just a few degrees from 37°\ncentigrade to\n33 and we were one of the first to to\nshow um that that was protective even\nafter the stroke in animals um my\nunderstanding is that when you cool\nneural tissue you quiet its electrical\nactivity in fact this is a common um\ntool for experimentation in in\nNeuroscience Laboratories you know you\nwant to shut down a a brain area\ntransiently you you cool it down right\nand in fact deep hypothermia has a\nprofound effect on shutting down the\nmetabolism so that's why when a someone\nparticularly kids fall into a frozen\npond with with ice cold water they can\nsurvive there for half an hour uh and\nmake a complete recovery because their\nbody temperature is dropped down to very\nlow like 20° Centigrade but this is less\nthis is just a few degrees so the amount\nthere is a slight decrease in the\nmetabolic activity but that does not\naccount for all the protection it's due\nto the fact that hypothermia mild\nhypothermia blocks many of those\ndetrimental Pathways it blocks partly\nthe release of those exitor amino acids\nglutamate it blocks the calcium influx\nit blocks the\ninflammation uh and so um that's\nprobably why it works so well it even\nblocks that other pathway of program\ncell death um because it hits all these\nPathways it's\nmultifactorial it's very effective and\nin fact it was finally shown in the\nearly 2000s in prospec of randomized\nstudies that one type of stroke actually\ntwo types I should say two types of\nstroke are benefited by cooling the\nbrain quickly one is cardiac arrest from\nventricular fibrillation\nand prospective studies which were\npublished in 2002 showed that if you uh\ncool patients who have cardiac arrest\nand then are resuscitated out in the\nfield down to between 32 and 34 degrees\nCentigrade from\n37 much better outcomes\nneurologically that's from Global eskema\nthat's the no blood getting to the brain\nbriefly and the other area where it's\nbeen shown to have um better outcomes is\nin neonatal what's called hypo schic\ninjury those are neonates who have lack\nof blood flow for some reason to the\nbrain when they're when they're born and\nif you cool them it's been shown in\nstudies up to 10 years later that they\nhave better cognitive outcomes so for\ncardiac arrest in in uh in the mid\n2000s uh I think it was\n2003 the American Heart\nAssociation determined if was a standard\nof care a guideline that you had to cool\npatients after cardiac arrest yes how\nwas the cooling done in the experiments\nthat you were involved in yeah so there\nare many ways to do it but in the animal\nmodels you can just cool them with a a\ncooling blanket actually in people uh we\ngot very interested in this in fact when\nI saw in the laboratory that it was so\neffective and and that we could cure you\nknow Mouse and and rat Stroke by Cooling\nI started cooling my patience in the\noperating room um because I I felt you\nknow even if it hasn't impr proven in in\nin patience that you know it was so\neffective it's the gold standard now\nactually for neuro for neuro protection\nagainst stroke in the in the\nlaboratory so back in um the\n1990s I started cooling all of my\npatients we started by cooling them by\nputting um packing them in I and putting\nalcohol on them but uh the operating\nroom staff appropriately didn't like\nthat cuz cuz alcohol is inflammable so\nthen we started using cooling blankets\nand then a number of companies um\nstarted developing cooling catheters and\nI work with several of these so you can\nactually cool very quickly uh if you put\na catheter in the uh into a a a vessel\nsay in the groin and um Infuse cold\nsaline which doesn't get into the into\nthe circulation but it cools the blood\nand the cooled blood then circulates um\nother ways of cooling are to putting on\num um special devices which cool quickly\nand that's what's used now are are\nexternal devices people are working on\ncooling just the head with\nhelmets um so it's still an active field\nof of Investigation for stroke and also\nfor cardiac arrest actually it has not\nbeen proven in well-designed prospective\ntrials that it works for garden variety\nfocal stroke it works for cardiac arrest\nwhere there's Global lack of blood flow\nto the brain like when the heart\nstops it hasn't been proven yet for the\nkind of stroke we've been talking about\nwhere there's a single blocked artery to\nthe brain so interesting I mean a lot of\ntimes on this podcast we talk about the\ncritical need for body temperature to\ndrop by 1 to 3° to get into deep sleep\nwe had Craig heler our colleague from\nthe biology department at Stanford on\nthe podcast where we talked about some\nof the Palmer Cooling and um essentially\ncooling the um soles of the feet the\npalms of the hands and the upper part of\nthe face as a way to more rapidly reduce\ncore body temperature um I think these\nare fascinating areas for exploration um\nthat obviously have clinical\napplications but but also you would\nimagine for some of the things we were\ntalking about before like just to um\nprovide a bit of neuroprotection after a\nhead hit or provide a bit of\nneuroprotection perhaps even as it\nrelates to aging you know spending a\nlittle bit of time maybe 10 minutes a\nday you know not badly hypothermic\nplease people but slightly hypothermic\nand then bringing the body temperature\nback up yeah I mean I wouldn't recommend\nif you have a head injury or or or a TIA\nto stick your head in a in a snow bank\nbut um even with traumatic brain injury\nsevere not just concussion but severe\nTBI traumatic brain injury um studies\nwere done looking at cooling hypothermia\nand it's called mild hypothermia because\nit's just a few degrees and the studies\nwere very suggestive but uh didn't get\nto the point that it was proven um\nalthough certain subgroups who were\ncooled quickly seemed to do better so I\nI think it's a subject that's still\nbeing studied um and as I say it's easy\nfor us to do in the operating room you\ndon't want to cool too much because that\ncan then inter fear with um other um\nmetabolic functions and clotting\nparameters and there uh it C can cause\nincreased infection if you go too low\nfor too long but um I still um uh let my\npatients cool just a few degrees and\nwe've had some anecdotal cases where\nwhere patients have had um uh problems\num and um because we cooled them we\nthink it it it made a benefit for\ninstance we had one patient who we\nhadn't even done uh I was getting ready\nto do a bypass to sew a scalp artery to\na brain artery but we hadn't even um uh\nI think made the the the the skin\nincision and the patient had a cardiac\narrest so we um uh and and it lasted for\na long time so we were pumping on the\nchest uh couldn't restore function and\nit was uh way outside the uh amount of\ntime that you would have expected a good\nrecovery but the patient had been cooled\ndown to 33° before we by the time it had\nhappened and um and then we finally uh\ngot the heart started we ended up\nputting some uh restoring flow through\ncatheters and and a heart lung machine\nand remarkably the guy made a complete\nrecovery so anecdotal but cases like\nthat um suggest maybe cooling um even a\nfew degrees has a protective effect on\nthe brain uh we certainly know it it's\ntrue for cardiac arrest and Global\nesia what are your thoughts on Plat rich\nplasma PRP these days we hear so much\nabout PRP I think it's FDA approved for\ncertain things right people will get um\nblood drawn they'll um spin down\nplatelets and then put in platelet rich\nplasma um a few years ago people were\nmaking claims out there about PRP\ncontaining stem cells I just for the\nrecord my understanding I'm sure someone\nwill argue with me online they always do\nbut my understanding is that PRP\ncontains very few if any stem cells um\nand that it's not legal to assert that\nPRP is stem cell therapy but PRP seems\nto be something that after an injury or\nin anticipation of a surgery people are\nstarting to do more and more because\nthey can go drop a few thousand dollars\nand I don't know get this infusion of\nPRP does it does it work to help recover\nbrain tissue or preserve brain tissue is\nthere any evidence of that what's\nwhatever I'm not an expert on on\nplatelet rich um you know um plasma but\num my reading of the literature uh\ncursorily uh suggests there's not hard\nevidence that it's beneficial I think\none has to be a little careful for\ninstance um I still um get um emails uh\nyou know every few weeks from people\nsaying uh I've had a stroke or I've had\na head injur\nand uh should I go to uh Russia or India\nor Mexico and get um stem cell therapy\nyeah this is a big topic area and and\nyou may have discussed it another\npodcast I have not I I'll do a solo\nepisode on stem cells and what they are\nand what they aren't I I just will just\nsorry to interrupt but I'm aware of a\nclinic in Florida that was injecting\nstem cells into the eyes of patients\nwith macular degeneration and some other\neye issues and those patients rapidly\nwent I was going to bring that up to and\nthat's what led the FDA to really clamp\ndown on stem cell clinics in the US\nalthough they haven't clamped in on\nthose type clinics as well they should\nbut I um I tell patients no if you go\nout of the country uh often you don't\nknow what you're getting if there's not\na an equivalent of an FDA which is\noverseeing it um you don't know whether\nthese sell where they come from\nsometimes they're not published\nliterature um you don't know um where\nthey're derived we've seen cas es of\npatients going elsewhere getting\ninjections into the brain or the spinal\ncord and developing tumors or other\nproblems so I discouraged that and I was\ngoing to bring up even in this country\num these clinics and that was published\num a number of years ago that clinic in\nFlorida\num those patients had macular\ndegeneration and they were losing their\nsight but they could still see to some\nextent they had their own adapost tissue\ntaken they sorted it for certain uh stem\ncells meenal stem cells and it was\nreinjected into the into the eye should\nhave been safe right their own cells\neven and as as you say several of them\nwent blind irreversibly irreversibly so\num I think this is very important to\nhighlight the the dangers of of stem\ncell therapy in general there's a lot of\nHope for it I mean we're engaged we're\njust finishing a a trial a first inhuman\ntrial at Stanford using we developed in\nmy lab 20 years ago it took us 20 years\nto prove that they were safe effective\ndidn't cause tumors and the study is\nlooking very promising it's a phase one\nstudy and we we're making uh plans to do\na phase two study with control patients\nwhich you always want to do uh but\ndespite the Hope um there is still a lot\nof hype and I think it's very important\nto to be careful about getting therapies\nthat are not proven yeah and uh while we\nwouldn't want anyone to take any kind of\nunnecessary risk you know to me anyway\nthis goes back to the beginning of of\nour conversation that there's something\nvery different about a knee from the\nbrain right I'm not saying go get stem\ncells injected into your knee but should\nyou be the sort of person that wants to\ndo that because that you feel that's\nwithin your rights you know again I\ndon't tell people what to do and you go\nto a clinic they get stem cells or I\ndon't know they they take stem cells\nfrom some source and put them into your\nknee I mean that's a very different um\nsituation than injecting into the brain\nb you know what some of the approaches\num to treat diseases of the brain or\ninjuries to the brain are not injecting\ndirectly into the brain they're\ninjecting\nintravenously or intraarterial threading\na cath up as we discuss and injecting in\nthe brain those cells it turns out don't\neven get into the brain um and the idea\nis that uh in some of the better studies\nthat that have been done in animals that\nthey work by modulating the IM immune\nsystem systemically those cells get\ntrapped in the lung in the spleen which\npeople describe as bioreactors and\nmodulate the immune system which does\nmake some sense as I say we we think one\nof the main benefits of these stem cells\nis that they modulate the immune system\nuh and that helps with plasticity in the\nbrain but even\nintravenous delivery can be can be\ndangerous to the brain yeah this is an\narea that uh we will spend a lot more\ntime on during this podcast\num despite what you just said I think\nthe the data I've seen from your\nlaboratory and as you you told me\nthere's a trial that's finishing up now\num that uh features those data or that\nuh is where those data arve from rather\num are really impressive I mean some\npeople who were largely IM mobile or\naphasic they couldn't speak um in some\ncases are able to speak or move and\nthat's really remarkable it's really\nexciting so I think that the future of\nstem cells in stroke therapy um is\npretty pretty bright at least from where\nI said yeah we don't want to oversell\nthis um but uh some of the uh results in\ncertain patients are remarkable I mean\nthe patients and their families has\nchanged their lives if you see them\nbefore and after it's almost like a\nmiracle others are not as impressive but\nuh so far in our trial uh and we've 17\nof the 18 U uh intended patients uh\nalmost all the patients have recovered\nto some extent and many of them have\nimproved um in a meaningful way if you\nuse certain scales so again we want to\nbe cautious we're going to do a\nprospective randomized blinded\ncontrolled study uh and that's the way\nit should be done and um if that's\npositive it would lead to a a a phase\nthree\num larger study again blinded controlled\nand if that's positive then it would\nlead to commercialization FDA approval\num it's a long process I've spent 23\nyears and more than\n46 million in Grants and philanthropy um\ngetting it to this stage wow yeah wow\nthat's that's a lot of time and a lot of\nmoney amazing that's way science and and\nand translation to clinical medicine is\num I would be remissed if I didn't ask\nyou know what are some of the things\nthat you think could accelerate that\nprocess or is that just the slow\niterative process that is science in\nmedicine I mean for instance if there\nwas um five times as much money um would\nthe science progress at you know five\ntimes the rate probably not um no but M\nmoney is a factor um it's not the only\nFactor uh the FDA is\nappropriately very cautious I think uh\nother countries the equivalent of the\nFDA uh moves things along a little\nquicker especially for therapies where\nthere's no no no other\ntreatment um uh so uh I think those\nfactors are are important um and would\naccelerate it I think greater\ncollaboration with industry and\npromoting more academic industry kinds\nof um relationships would help because\nuh the the government agencies uh do not\nuh provide enough money to uh do the\nfinal stage you know there's called this\nValley of Death where you get initial uh\nencouraging uh data even clinically but\nyou can't move the hurdle to get it into\nFDA approval um because of uh of money\nin some cases I've seen as an example uh\na number of very good stem cell\ntherapies um um not make it because the\ncompanies went bankrupt the board of\ndirectors of the company felt the\nresults were good but not good enough\nand they pulled the funding yeah so uh\nthis is a whole area which I was not\nwell well informed of until I got into\nthis um of how you you know move through\nthe FDA and how you um you know work\nwith industry uh I haven't formed a\ncompany yet but I'm going to have to\nbecause for the next trial this trial I\nwas for forunate to get a grant from\nsurm California Institute for\nregenerative Medicine of $12 million\nthat's taxpayer dollars exactly great\nuse of taxpayer money putting into\nreally Forward Thinking research but the\nnext trial and our results are good\nenough that we probably will only need\nif we do a statistical power analysis 69\npatients initially we thought we'd need\n170 patients but the results keep\ngetting better and better so now uh it\nseems we would only need uh\nuh uh about 69 patients that will cost\nat least 45\nmillion um and as the trials get larger\neven more so uh yeah we need to figure\nout a better way to allocate money to to\nmake these advances it sounds like um a\ncompany or some role of industry is\ngoing to be necessary a um well you\nmight be interested in investing right I\nmean well that the um the this podcast\nis always available free the standard La\npodcast our premium channel um actually\ngenerates uh money we do uh askme any\nthings and things of that sort we have\ndonors that have come in for a dollar\nmatch and we do philanthropy to\nLaboratories at Stanford sulk Institute\nColumbia University we've already done\nthat we're going to do more of this well\nI was I was big fous oh no listen we\ncould explore it one of the one of the\nguidelines is that we fund research on\nhumans exclusively um so we could talk\nabout that the um a former colleague of\nours at Stanford um once told me that\nthe joke um we'll see if I get in\ntrouble for this joke um which is that\nthere are two kinds of Stanford faculty\nStanford faculty with companies and\nStanford faculty with successful\ncompanies so um we'll we'll see if we'll\nsee what comes down the pike from that\nbut you know I mean many of the\nTechnologies and and discoveries that\nhave been made at Stanford have spun off\ninto um you know there these little\ncompanies like you know Chente and you\nknow other companies like that that um\nare not strictly Stanford relations but\nof course other universities too but you\nknow the universities are where the\nbasic research is done and then then\nsomebody has to implement those\nStanford's getting much better when I\ncame to Stanford in\n1974 um it was uh the medical center was\nmore like an NIH of the West and there\nwas not a lot of uh clinical Excellence\nexcept for cardiac surgery norm shway\nand radiation oncology uh Henry Kaplan\nwho had developed the first radiation uh\nmethod for treating\nlymphoma uh and we were great at making\nbasic discoveries is not very good at\ntranslating them but over you know the\nlast what 50 years Stanford has gotten\nmuch better at uh translating them um uh\ninto you know clinical therapies uh and\neven doing some of that work at Stanford\nnot farming it out to other other places\nso I think that's another area that we\nneed to we need to encourage well the\nproximity to um big Tech um is uh sort\nof built into the fabric of of the Bay\nArea now there's just no escaping that\nand I think uh overall um you know it's\nnot without its sometimes issues but\noverall I think it's a really good thing\num facilitates the most rapid possible\nflow between basic science Discovery and\num implementation at at large um I want\nto make sure that we cover just a little\nbit about vagal stimulation a lot of\nlisteners this podcast are familiar with\nthe Vegas nerve as this very extensive\npathway connecting brain and body in\nboth directions um the common idea out\nthere is that the Vegas is associated\nwith calming because it's in the\nparasympathetic arm of the autonomic\nnervous system the so-called rest and\ndigest pathway but I happen to know and\nI'm sure you know from experimentation\nand from Clinical work that oftentimes\nvagal stimulation is a way of bringing\nsay depressed patients up to more\nalertness that vagal stimulation is not\nalways about calming it can be about\nalerting the brain um or making the\nbrain more alert um so what sorts of\nvagal stimulation are you doing um given\nthat the vagel pathway is so um\nextensive you know like like which\nbranch of the Vegas do you stimulate\nthere's it goes around the ear it's in\nthe neck it goes down through the gut I\nmean we're talking basically about a\nsuper highway of I mean it kind of\nreminds me of the Austin freeway system\nif you've ever driven in Austin it's\nlike the freeways go in every which\ndirection that's so whenever I'm there\nI'm like the freeway system here is kind\nof like the Vegas so which um Avenue do\nyou stimulate in order to get a desired\neffect right well for stroke and as as I\nalluded to um vagal nerve stimulation\ncoupled with physical therapy physical\nactivity very intensive was the very\nfirst FDA approved treatment for chronic\nstroke patients that was approved in uh\n2021 3 years ago and it was shown in the\nstudy that compared with um\nnon-stimulation in other words putting\nthe stimulator on but not not\nstimulating and doing the therapy that\npatients did better it was a modest\nImprovement but felt to be uh meaningful\nand it was shown to be effective at 90\ndays only three\nmonths now recently at the last\nInternational stroke meeting last uh\nthis past February uh it was presented\nand I don't I don't know if it's been\npublished yet that those results hold up\nfor for a uh up to a year so um the way\nit works presumably is that you\nstimulate the entire vus nerve in the\nneck and it's not the peripheral effects\non the heart or the other autonomic\norgans where it's working it's\nstimulation that goes back to the brain\nright because when you stimulate a nerve\nit doesn't go in One Direction and\nthat's probably how it works for\ndepression also not a systemic but and\nthe Vagas has lots of connection with\nbrain functions right um and so that's\nit's not completely clear which areas\nare being stimulated to recover from\nstroke or or improve depression but it's\nbrain stimulation that somehow again\nresurrect circuits or induces plasticity\nin circuits uh again it's it's it's\nsomething that um we're learning about\nand uh I think not just vagal nerve\nstimulation but stimulation of the brain\nis becoming a very important uh\nInnovative treatment for many brain\ndiseases and injuries is the vagal\nstimulation uh is it invasive or can you\nuse an external stimulator it's invasive\nyou have to do an operation it's\nlowrisk um very few side effects\noccasionally there are some it can cause\nsome problems with swallowing which are\nusually temporary right because the\nvagal nerve um the recurrent vagal nerve\nsupplies the the laryn the vocal cord\nbut um so it's an implanted\nstimulator but the stimulation could be\nturned on and off with an external um\nmagnet device\nincredible Gary uh Dr Steinberg I want\nto thank you um for several things first\nof all uh for coming here today to share\nwith us um right up until the point we\nhit uh hot mics meaning we we started\nrecording uh you were getting calls\nabout patients I know you're still in\nthe operating room you were our\ndepartment chair for more than two\ndecades 25 years 25 years thank you for\nthat um uh and you know still just so\nactive in this area doing Cutting Edge\nresearch and stem cells and so much more\num so as an extremely busy person who\nhas many important duties you are\nliterally a brain surgeon um to take the\ntime out of your schedule to come here\nand share with us all this information\nabout how to keep our brain healthy the\nrelationship between alcohol nicotine\nfortunately caffeine's not on the list\nbut don't overdo it folks um\nneuroprotection the discussion about TBI\nsomething we've never discussed on this\npodcast um transient esumic attacks and\njust a really vast survey of things that\nconcern a lot of people and that also\nnow having uh heard what you've shared\nalso it puts them in a position now to\nempower themselves to take some agency\nover their brain health which is\nsomething that I think most people\nreally fear that this thing inside our\nskulls is outside the reach of our\nefforts to try and maintain health and\nclearly you've um explained how that is\nnot the case and there are things we can\ndo to both protect ourselves and to\novercome challenges should they arise so\non behalf of myself and and all the\nlisteners and viewers I just want to say\nthank you so much and hopefully as these\ntrials um continue to develop um you'll\ncome back and update us on the progress\nAndrew it's been a real pleasure thank\nyou for inviting me thank you for\njoining me for today's discussion with\nDr Gary Steinberg to learn more
