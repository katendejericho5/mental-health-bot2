    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[bright music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are discussing cannabis,\nalso referred to as marijuana.\nCannabis includes many different compounds\nthat have profound impact\non the brain and body,\nso while many of you have\nprobably heard of THC,\nthere are also compounds\nin cannabis such as CBD,\nand of course there are different types\nor strains of cannabis,\nincluding sativa strains\nand indica strains\nand hybrid strains, and believe it or not,\nnowadays, there is also\nan entire literature,\nmeaning a scientific\nand medicinal literature\nabout type one, type two\nand type three strains.\nI'll explain what all of\nthat is and how they work.\nI'll talk about some of\nthe medicinal applications\nof different strains of cannabis\nand combinations of cannabis strains,\nas well as some of the\npotential health hazards\nof cannabis use.\nI want to emphasize that any\ndiscussion about cannabis\nhas to be framed within the context\nthat the legality of\ncannabis varies tremendously\ndepending on where you are in the world,\nso depending on which country you're in\nand even which state you're in\nor which area within a country,\npossessing and using and\ncertainly selling cannabis\ncan be either highly\nillegal or entirely legal\nor decriminalized or largely overlooked.\nYou, of course, are obligated to know\nwhat those local laws are for you,\nwhere you live and where you travel.\nWith that said, today's discussion\nreally will include a full picture\nas to where cannabis and the various\nand even very specific\ncompounds within cannabis\ncan be extremely useful in\nthe treatment of some ailments\nand where certain compounds in cannabis\ncan be extremely dangerous for\ncertain individuals to use,\nin particular, individuals\nthat have preexisting,\ngenetic propensity for psychosis.\nThat theme is going to\ncome up again and again,\nbut we are also going to talk\nabout the role of cannabis\nin anxiety and depression,\nboth positive and negative effects.\nWe'll talk about sex differences\nin terms of women versus men\nand how they react\ndifferently to cannabis,\nand I would be entirely remiss\nif I didn't include a\nconversation about cannabis,\nmeaning THC, CBD, hybrid\nstrains, et cetera\nin creativity and different\nmodes of thinking,\nbecause as many of you probably know\nor at least have heard about,\ncannabis can impact the way that we think,\nthe types of memory systems we can access\nand what's called convergent\nand divergent thinking,\nwhich is one way of conceptualizing\nwhat is commonly referred\nto as creativity.\nSo today's discussion is going to include\na lot of information,\nbut I promise to make it clear\nand accessible to all of you,\nregardless of whether or\nnot you have a background\nin biology or not,\nand today's discussion\nwill also be quite nuanced.\nYou'll find me routinely reading\ndirectly from specific research papers,\nsomething that of course we\nalways do on this podcast,\nbut today I'm really going to dig\ninto some of the finer points\nof the methodology in papers\nand some of the statistics that were used\nand the specific populations\nof people that were studied,\nbecause as it turns out,\nthere are instances that we will discuss\nin which the use of cannabis\ncan be immensely beneficial\nto one group and yet can\nbe entirely detrimental\nto another group, even\nat equivalent dosages\nand depending on a number\nof different factors,\nso we will discuss what those factors are.\nJust to give you a brief overview\nof the kind of structure I'm\ngoing to put on today's episode,\nwe will review of course,\ncannabis and its various forms.\nI'll talk about some of the biology,\nbut we are going to really\ndrill into how dosage,\nthat is the concentration\nof THC relative to CBD,\nimpacts whether or not cannabis\nis going to have one effect or another.\nWe will also talk about\nthe frequency of use,\ndaily use, multiple times per day use,\nweekly use or monthly or occasional use.\nWe will also talk about\ndifferent professions\nand how some people may have\na little bit more leeway\nin terms of whether or not\nthey decide to use cannabis\nor any of its various component\nchemical constituents,\nthat is CBD or THC, et cetera.\nAnd for other professions,\nit might be entirely inappropriate\nbecause of the particular\nkinds of cognitive tasks\nthose professions demand.\nWe will also talk about\ngenetic predisposition,\nagain, sex differences, hormone effects,\nand I will also touch on what I think\nis the most important variable\nin determining whether or not cannabis\nis right or wrong for\nyou, and that is your age\nat which you are considering starting\nor continuing use or ceasing use.\nWhat I can assure you is that\nby the end of today's podcast,\nyou will have a quite thorough\nunderstanding of cannabis,\nhow it works, what it does,\nwhat its potential benefits can be,\nwhat its potential hazards are,\nand whether or not it's right for you\nand the people that you know.\nI'm excited to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nhas now launched a premium channel.\nThe purpose of the premium\nchannel is severalfold.\nFirst of all, I will be\nhosting regular AMAs,\nAsk Me Anythings, where\nyou can ask me anything,\nand I will provide answers in depth\nto your specific questions about science\nand science related\ntools for mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nNow, there is a nominal\ncost to the premium channel.\nIt's $10 per month, or you can\npay $100 for the entire year.\nI should mention, however,\nthat a significant portion of the funds\nraised through the premium channel\nare going to support not just\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\nwhich we will continue to\nrelease every Monday on schedule\nof zero cost to all consumers' content\non mental health, physical\nhealth and performance,\nbut proceeds from the premium channel\nwill also be used to fund research,\nin particular research\ndone on human beings,\nso not animal models, but on human beings,\nwhich I think we all agree is a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd, we are going to\nspecifically fund research\nthat is aimed toward\ndeveloping further protocols\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance,\nand those protocols will be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab Podcast and\nother media channels.\nSo the idea here is to\ngive you information\nto your burning questions in depth\nand allow you the opportunity\nto support the kind of research\nthat provides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny Foundation\nhas generously offered\nto do a dollar-for-dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific way\nthat they're going to amplify\nwhatever funds come in\nthrough the premium channel\nto further support research for science\nand science-related tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up\nfor the Huberman Lab premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost of $10 per month\nor you can pay $100 upfront\nfor the entire year.\nThat will give you access to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,\nand you'll of course get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium content,\nsuch as transcripts of the AMAs\nand various transcripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab Podcast episodes\nand not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be supporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nYou can sign up for the premium channel\nby going to hubermanlab.com/premium,\nagain, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.\nBefore diving into all of that,\nI'd like to highlight a new,\nwhat I think is a very useful\nand zero cost resource.\nThis resource is what's\ncalled Non-Sleep Deep Rest\nor NSDR protocol.\nI've talked many times before\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nabout Non-Sleep Deep Rest, AKA, NSDR.\nNSDR is sort of an umbrella term\nfor a variety of different practices,\nso these are behavioral practices\nthat allow you to direct\nyour brain and body\ninto a particular state,\nand most typically,\nthat state is one of deep relaxation,\nbut also one in which you\ncan access your bodily\nand brain systems for teaching yourself\nhow to relax in real\ntime and how to recover\nsome of the sleep that you\nmay not be getting at night,\nand to restore levels of dopamine\nin particular areas of the\nbrain that are involved\nin motivation and cognitive\nand motor control.\nBasically, NSDR is a\nwonderfully restorative tool.\nThis has been demonstrated\nmany times over now\nthrough quality peer-reviewed science,\nand there are neurochemical benefits,\nand there are physical benefits,\nand there are certainly\npsychological benefits.\nI highly recommend NSDR to anybody\nthat has trouble falling asleep\nor that wakes up in\nthe middle of the night\nand needs to get better\nat falling back asleep,\nas well as to anyone out\nthere that has issues\nwith anxiety or\nself-regulation of any kind.\nAnd if you don't have any of those issues,\nit's also immensely beneficial\njust as a restorative\nfor leaning back into\nfocused work of any kind.\nNow, a number of people have reached out\nabout finding NSDR protocols,\nand there are a number\nof different good ones\nout there floating around.\nI've decided to put a\nzero-cost NSDR script\nout there on the internet\nfor people to access,\nso you can find it by going to YouTube\nand simply put my last\nname, 'Huberman' and 'NSDR'\ninto the search function.\nThis is a YouTube channel\nthat's hosted by Virtusan,\nwhich has a terrific\napp that includes NSDR\nand a number of other health\nand wellness protocols,\nbut they've been quite generous\nin hosting a 10 minute NSDR, read by me.\nThis NSDR is distinct from,\nalthough I should say,\nsimilar to yoga nidra,\nwhich some of you are familiar with.\nThis NSDR is different than yoga nidra\nin the sense that it\ndoesn't have intentions.\nThere's no mystical component,\nand I describe a little bit of the science\nand why specific components\nof the NSDR are included,\nthings like long exhale breathing,\nI talk about perceptual shifts\nand how to move from thinking and planning\nto pure sensation.\nIf none of that makes sense right now,\nit'll make total sense after\nlistening to the NSDR script.\nAgain, it's a 10 minute\nNSDR script, read by me.\nYou can do this first thing in\nthe morning when you wake up,\nespecially if you didn't\nget enough sleep that night,\nand you're feeling a little bit fatigued,\nand you need to lean into\nthe day with full vigor.\nYou could do it at any\npoint during the day\nor if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night.\nAgain, this is a zero-cost\nresource for you.\nYou can find it by going to YouTube,\nput my last name in and NSDR.\nI encourage you to try\nit, and if you like it\nor frankly, if you don't,\nyou can just put that\nin the comment section there on YouTube,\nand I've put it there as\na free resource to you,\nso that you can benefit\nfrom the research-backed,\npeer-reviewed studies that point to NSDR\nas a very useful practice.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\nLevels is a program that lets you see\nhow different foods affect your health\nby giving you real-time\nfeedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\nOne of the most important factors\nin your immediate and long-term health\nis how well you're\nmanaging your blood glucose\nor blood sugar.\nI started using Levels about a year ago\nas a way to see how different foods\nand different lifestyle factors\nwere impacting my blood glucose levels.\nSo for instance, it allowed\nme to see how different foods\nand particular macronutrients\nand combinations of macronutrients\nwould either peak or trough my blood sugar\nor keep my blood sugar steady.\nIt also allowed me to see how working out\nwith weights or running, how\nthat impacted my blood glucose.\nSo for me, it was a fascinating\nexperiment unto myself\nas to how my meal schedule, the\nspecific foods I was eating,\ndifferent combinations of\nfood, as I mentioned before,\nand exercise were combining to regulate\nthis thing that we call blood sugar\nand that's so vital to our health.\nI think anyone that tries Levels will find\nthat you learn an immense\namount about what you're doing\nand what you ought to be doing differently\nin order to optimize your\nimmediate feelings of wellbeing\nand your health trajectory.\nIf you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a CGM yourself,\ngo to levels.link/huberman,\nthat's levels.link, L-I-N-K, /huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics\nthat are designed for\nyour particular needs.\nI am not a fan of the word nootropics,\nbecause nootropics\nliterally means smart drugs\nor smart drug, and frankly,\nas a neuroscientist,\nI know and every other\nneuroscientist knows\nthat there is no neural circuit\nor chemical in the brain for being smart.\nThere are, for instance,\nneural circuits and chemicals\nthat increase your ability to focus\nor your ability to task switch.\nThesis understands this and therefore,\nhas designed custom nootropics that vary\nand are tailored to you\nso that, for instance,\nif you want to achieve focus and clarity\nfor one particular type of work,\nthere is a Nootropic for that.\nOr if you'd like to have more\nenergy and have more focus,\nthere's a different Nootropic for that.\nIf you'd like to get your own personalized\nnootropics starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman,\ntake that three minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month,\nand then they'll work with you and iterate\nto find the best formulas\nfor you to take ongoing.\nAgain, that's

platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed with\na quality blood test.\nWith a lot of blood tests and\nDNA tests out there, however,\nan issue is you get information back\nabout lipids and hormones, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they\nhave a personalized platform\nthat makes interpreting your data\nand then acting on that\ndata very straightforward\nand very directed toward\nspecific protocols.\nWhat I mean by that is\nyou'll get information back\nabout hormone levels\nand metabolic factors,\nlipids, et cetera, and then you can look\nto nutritional changes,\nsupplementation changes,\nexercise protocol changes\nand other lifestyle features\nthat combine or work on their own\nto start to try and shift those numbers\ninto the range that's appropriate for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit

like enhancing sleep\nand the depth of sleep,\nor for enhancing focus\nand cognitive ability,\nor for enhancing energy or\nadjusting hormone levels\nto optimal range for you.\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor a number of important reasons.\nFirst of all, the quality\nof their ingredients\nis exceptional, it's\nreally second to none.\nSecond of all, they ship internationally,\nand that was important to us,\nbecause a number of you reside\noutside of the United States.\nThird, we've worked with\nMomentous very closely\nto develop single-ingredient formulations.\nNow, this turns out to be very important,\nbecause if you're going\nto take supplements,\nyou want to know what's\nworking for you and what isn't.\nAnd of course, you want to\noptimize the cost efficiency\nand the biological efficiency\nof those supplements.\nTo find the supplements we discuss\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nyou can go to livemomentous spelled O-U-S,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman,\nand I should just mention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about cannabis,\nand when we refer to cannabis,\nwe are indeed referring to\nmarijuana or the marijuana plant.\nNow, cannabis plants\ncome in different strains\nor different varieties,\nand those different strains\nare indeed different genetic strains.\nSo just as animals and humans\nhave different genetic backgrounds,\nand they can be crossed to one another\nto yield further genetic\nvariation in the offspring,\nplants can be hybridized to one another\nin various ways through grafting\nor through the use of different\ntypes of seed combinations,\net cetera, in order to\ngenerate different strains.\nThere are also naturally\noccurring differences\nin the strains of plants,\nand the cannabis plant is no exception.\nSo for instance, in the context\nof the discussion about cannabis\nand its medicinal uses\nand recreational uses,\nwe need to distinguish\nbetween the sativa variety,\nthe indica variety, a\nvariety called ruderalis\nthat's not often discussed,\nand hybrids of sativa,\nindica and ruderalis.\nBefore diving into the\ndifferent strains of cannabis\nand how they impact the brain embody,\nboth similarly and differently,\nI want to emphasize\nthat the cannabis plant\ncontains a number of different\npsychoactive compounds.\nNow, the most powerful of\nthose compounds is THC.\nThe technical name for it is\ndelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.\nBut THC, as I'll refer to it,\nis just one of the psychoactive\nand biologically active\ncompounds within cannabis plants.\nThere's also CBD, which\nis technically referred to\nas cannabidiol, and cannabidiol, CBD,\nis known to be used for\nthings like pain management,\nanxiety management and\nother medicinal purposes.\nWe will talk about the efficacy\nof CBD for those purposes,\nas well as some of, believe it or not,\nsome of the dangers of CBD,\ndepending on where it's sourced\nand the dosage, et cetera.\nSo we've got THC, CBD and\nalso CBN or cannabinol.\nCBN is less often discussed.\nYou're going to hear a lot less\nabout CBN containing products out there,\nCBN containing medicines,\nbut it is relevant to today's discussion,\nso it will come up a bit.\nNow, I will be sure to\nprovide more specificity\nto what I'm about to say,\nbut very broadly speaking,\nTHC is largely responsible\nfor the psychoactive effects of cannabis,\nthat is the changes in mood,\nthe changes in bodily state\nand sensation, et cetera.\nWhereas CBD and to some extent,\nCBN, have profound effects\non the brain and body,\nbut they don't tend to\ngive people the sensation\nof altered perception,\naltered mood, et cetera.\nSome people might say they are\nnot the component of cannabis\nthat, quote unquote, gets you high,\nalthough today, we will really drill into\nwhat the high itself represents\nin terms of chemical\nsystems in the brain body.\nAnd what we will soon learn is that\nwhat we think of as being\nhigh actually includes\na number of different changes\nin the brain and body,\nsome of which can be\nbest explained by CBD,\nnot by THC, which runs counter\nto what most people out\nthere know and believe.\nSo broadly speaking, we\nhave THC, CBD and CBN.\nBut I want to point out\nthat the cannabis plant\nhas over 70, seven-zero,\n70 different psychoactive compounds,\nmany of which still have not been studied\nin isolation and in detail.\nSo there's a big future\nof research for cannabis\nand for THC and THC-related\npsychoactive compounds,\nas well as for CBD and CBN.\nToday we're mainly going to focus\non THC and CBD, as I mentioned before.\nI should also point out\nthat the cannabis plant\nhas over 400 biologically\nactive compounds.\nSo these are biologically active compounds\nthat may or may not have\npsychoactive properties,\nthat may or may not be useful\nfor pain relief, et cetera.\nAgain, there is a vast\nlandscape for exploration\nof the cannabis plant and of\nhemp for what they include\nthat could be beneficial\nto us or detrimental to us,\nso again, a lot more work to do.\nToday, we're going to really\ntry and stay on target\nwith what we already know\nand where there are\ncertain exciting mysteries\nor intriguing mysteries\nabout what we ought to explore more.\nI will certainly highlight those.\nLet's go back to the different strains\nof the cannabis plant,\nsativa, indica and ruderalis\nand explore how each of those\ndifferentially impacts the brain and body,\nbecause therein I think\nwe can start to learn\na lot about this incredible plant\nthat is the cannabis plant.\nAnd whether or not you\nare a user of cannabis\nor whether or not you are\nentirely opposed to cannabis use,\nunderstanding how cannabis works\nin the brain and body, itself,\nis absolutely fascinating\nand can teach you a lot about\nhow your brain and body work\nat a basic level and\ncan tell you a lot about\nhow your brain and body will\nreact to different life events\nand how your mood is\nestablished and stabilized,\nand how your appetite is\nestablished and stabilized\nand so on.\nSo we have the three\nmajor strains of cannabis,\nsativa, indica and ruderalis.\nAnd for sake of today's conversation,\nwe can pretty much cross off ruderalis.\nIt's not often consumed,\nand components of ruderalis\nare not often consumed\nfor medicinal or recreational purposes.\nLet's focus on sativa and indica.\nPeople will consume the\nsativa variety of cannabis\neither by edible or by smoking cannabis,\nor they will consume the\nindica variety of cannabis,\nagain by edible or by smoking cannabis,\nor sometimes they will take\nit in a transdermal form\nor a sublingual form.\nThere are a bunch of different ways\nto get the cannabis into the body,\nbut there's a clear distinction\nbetween sativa and indica\nthat actually shows up first\nin the structure of the plant.\nAt their extremes, meaning\nin a pure strain of sativa,\nit tends to be a taller\nplant, a longer stock,\nbelieve it or not,\nand actually the length of the\nleaves is quite a bit longer,\nwhereas the indica plant tends\nto be more short and stout.\nAnd, for those aficionados out there,\nI'm sure you know a lot of\nthe other specific features\nof sativa versus indica,\nbut already what we're talking\nabout is the same plant,\ncannabis, with two very\ndifferent morphologies or shapes.\nYou might say, \"Well, why is\nthis interesting or important\n\"to how it affects me\nor affects other people\n\"for medicinal or recreational purposes?\"\nWell, it turns out that even\nthough they are the same plant,\nthese two different genetic varieties,\nbecause of the way that they grow\nand the way they capture sunlight\nand the way, believe it or\nnot, that the different plants\nwithin that strain\ninteract with one another,\n'cause believe it or not,\nplants are interacting with one another,\nthey actually bring different elements\nof the psychoactive compounds\nto different components\nwithin the leaves and the so-called buds.\nThe takeaway is that when consumed,\nand when I say consumed,\nI want to be very clear,\nI don't necessarily just\nmean oral consumption\nor eating cannabis sativa by edible,\nI also mean smoking it,\nand that could be...\npeople will, just like with tobacco,\nthe way that they bring\nthe psychoactive components\ninto their bloodstream and\ninto their brain and body\nis to essentially heat the dried leaves\nof the cannabis plant.\nThen the heat liberates some\nof the psychoactive components\nthat when inhaled into the lungs,\nbecause the lungs include\na lot of vasculature,\na lot of basically blood\nvessels and capillaries,\nthat the psychoactive components\nare actually directly absorbed\nfrom the lungs into the bloodstream,\nand they can cross into the bloodstream\nand permeate throughout the body\nand cross the so-called\nblood brain barrier.\nSo in other words, burning\nthe plant liberates the smoke\nthat contains the psychoactive compounds,\nand those are inhaled into the lungs\nand then get into the brain and body\nand act on the brain and body.\nAnd the major effect of sativa varieties\nare to create a high, if you will,\nand I'm putting this in air quotes\nfor those of you that are listening,\nbut to also act as a stimulant.\nThe sativa varieties tend to make people\nfeel invigorated, somewhat alert.\nIt doesn't tend to be\nas much of a sedative\nas some of the other varieties.\nSome people report\nheightened sense of focus\nor heightened sense of creativity.\nWe'll talk a little bit later on\nas to whether or not they actually\nare achieving heightened\nlevels of focus and creativity,\nor whether or not they\njust perceive themselves\nto have heightened levels\nof focus and creativity.\nThe sativa varieties tend to make people\nfeel a little bit less susceptible\nto pain and noxious stimuli,\nwhich are basically stimuli\nthat you don't like.\nSo the sativa varieties are\noften prescribed or are used\nin the recreational context\nfor pain management and relief.\nBasically, the sativa variety is known\nto include a head biased effect.\nSo here, we're talking\nabout subjective effects,\nand of course these will vary\nfrom one individual to the next.\nSome people will smoke cannabis sativa\nor ingest cannabis sativa orally\nand will feel an entirely\ndifferent array of effects,\nbut most people, the majority of people\nexperience a head-centered\nhigh, alertness, focus\nand a sense that they're more creative.\nContrast that with the\nindica varieties of cannabis,\nand when people smoke or eat\nor ingest indica varieties,\nthe psychoactive components of indica,\nand again, this is pure indica,\nso not hybridized with sativa\nat all, but just pure indica,\ntend to lead to more full-bodied effects.\nPeople report feeling more\ncomplete, full-body relaxation,\nmore of a sedative effect.\nIndica cannabis is often prescribed\nand/or used recreationally\nin order to achieve a state of sleep\nor to help relieve anxiety,\nso less of a stimulant effect.\nAnd we will talk about why,\nliterally, the underlying neural circuits\nthat lead to the sativa\nvariety causing more\nof a elevated mood and a\nhead high, if you will,\nand the indica variety as being\nmore full body relaxation.\nOne of the ways to\nremember the distinction\nbetween the effects of cannabis\nsativa and cannabis indica\nwas relayed to me by a friend\nwho actually was a chronic,\nmeaning every day, all\nday, consumer of marijuana.\nHe basically smoked marijuana for 20 years\nbefore quitting about\nfour or five years ago,\nand he said that indica\nis often referred to\nas 'in-da-couch,' meaning\nlaid back in the couch.\nAnd that can help you remember\nthat the indica varieties of cannabis\ndo tend to be more\nsedative in their effects.\nOkay, so there's sativa\nand there's indica,\nand then now there are hybrid strains.\nSo marijuana growers and\npeople who specialize\nin creating novel varieties\nof the cannabis plant,\nagain, I'm using the words\ncannabis and marijuana\nmore or less interchangeably here,\nthey are very good at\ncreating new strains of plant\nthat might be 25% sativa and\n75% indica or vice versa,\nor 50/50 or 90/10.\nEssentially, what's happening nowadays\nis that through plant biology,\nplant genetics, I should say,\ngrowers are getting quite efficient\nat creating a variety of different strains\nof the marijuana plant that\ngive rise to very nuanced\nand distinct effects on brain and body.\nIn fact, so much so, that\nthere's now a new nomenclature,\na new language emerging around cannabis\nand the development of\nnovel strains of cannabis\nfor medicinal and/or\nrecreational purposes.\nAnd while this might\nsound a little bit medical\nor a little bit clinical to\nsome people, believe it or not,\nthis is the nomenclature\nthat is now typically used.\nPeople still refer to the sativa,\nindica and hybrid strains,\nbut there's now also a description\nof so-called type one, type\ntwo and type three strains\nfor any given sativa,\nindica or hybrid strain.\nOkay, so just to put this\nclearly in your mind,\nyou've got sativa varieties,\nthat is pure sativa varieties.\nYou have indica varieties,\nagain, pure indica,\nand then you have hybrid varieties,\nand beneath each of those,\nyou have type one, type\ntwo and type three strains\nof indica, sativa or hybrid varieties.\nWhat are type one, type\ntwo and type three?\nWell, type one, type two\nand type three strains\nare strains that have varying amounts\nor ratios of THC to CBD.\nSo for instance, type one strain,\nso for instance, you could\nhave a pure sativa, type one,\nor a type one pure sativa\nor a type one indica.\nThose are going to have\nthe greatest amount\nof THC relative to CBD.\nAnd I really want to emphasize this,\nunderstanding the ratio of THC to CBD\ncan help explain a lot\nor even predict a lot\nabout how a given strain of\ncannabis will impact somebody.\nFor instance, because THC\nis largely responsible\nfor the typical psychoactive\ncomponents of cannabis,\nso what I mean here is, if\nsomebody's ingesting sativa,\nand it routinely makes\nthem feel more energized,\nelevates their mood,\nit gives them a heightened\nsense of creativity,\nif that's what they experience,\nand they're taking a\ntype one version of that,\nthat means that it's quite rich\nin THC and very little CBD.\nHowever, if they were to take\na type one version of sativa,\nand it feels far too strong,\nlike too much energy,\nor they felt like they were\ntoo much in their head,\nnowadays, there are strains of sativa\nthat have been genetically engineered,\nand I don't mean by an\nengineer tinkering away\nwith gene engineering in\na CRISPR creating mutes,\nbut literally by hybridizing,\ncrossing different plants to one another,\ncreating in a natural context,\nthe same way plants in the outside world\nwould sometimes hybridize to one another,\ncreating a variety\nthat's perhaps type two,\nwhich is going to have\nless THC and more CBD,\nor a type three, which is\ngoing to be very high CBD\nand very little THC,\nand the same is also true\nfor the indica varieties.\nSo I want to make sure that\neveryone understands this,\nbecause it becomes very important\nfor understanding the biology of cannabis\nand predicting positive versus\nnegative effects of cannabis.\nSativa has this stimulant-like effect\nand tends to be more of\na head high, if you will.\nIndica tends to be more full-body,\nthen lead to more in-da-couch,\nas I refer to it before,\npun intended, deep relaxation,\nreduce insomnia, et cetera.\nNow, within each of\nthose sativa and indica,\nyou have type one, type\ntwo and type three,\nand that has everything\nto do with how much THC,\nwhich is the dominant\npsychoactive compound,\nversus CBD, which has other\neffects, mainly on the body,\nbut not so much on the brain\nand modes of thinking and mood, et cetera,\nhow much THC versus CBD is present.\nAnd again, type one is THC dominant,\ntype two, equal ratios, if\nyou will, of THC and CBD,\nand type three tend to be high CBD.\nOkay, so already we've got\nsome categorization here\nthat hopefully isn't overwhelming to you,\nbut this turns out to\nbe extremely important\nif you want to understand\nhow cannabis works\nand predict the effects of cannabis.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens,\nonce are usually twice a day,\nis that it gets to me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\nthat communicate with the\nbrain, the immune system,\nand basically all the\nbiological systems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health,\nand those probiotics in Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens, vitamins and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my foundational\nand nutritional needs are\nmet, and it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you\nfive free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nin the car, on the plane, et cetera,\nand they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nOkay, so somewhat surprisingly,\nwe're going to set aside cannabis.\nWe're going to take what we\nknow about sativa, indica,\ntype one, type two, type\nthree, CBD, et cetera,\nand we're just going to set\nthat aside for a moment.\nWhy would we do that?\nWell, we have to ask ourselves,\nwhy would any of these plants,\nwhy would any of these\ncompounds, THC, CBD,\nsativa, indica, et cetera,\nwhy would any of that have\nany effect on us at all?\nAnd this discussion\nthat we're about to have\nvery much resembles the discussion\nthat we had on a previous\nepisode about nicotine,\nbecause as many of you know,\nnicotine is a commonly used substance.\nIn fact, if we were to look\nat the three most commonly used drugs,\nalcohol will be at the top of the list.\nMany billions of people\nregularly use alcohol\nor occasionally use alcohol.\nMany billions of people also use nicotine.\nIt's the second most consumed\ndrug, so more than 1 billion\nand probably closer to 2\nbillion people consume nicotine,\nand then the third most consumed drug\nis cannabis in one form or another.\nAnd many of you are probably shouting,\n\"What about caffeine?\nWhat about caffeine?\"\nWell, in the context of drugs,\nand in particular, addictive drugs,\ncaffeine doesn't quite rise to the list,\nbut if we were to look at caffeine\nand include it in that list,\ncaffeine would be above all of those.\nBut the most commonly\nused drugs are alcohol,\nsecond after that is\nnicotine and then cannabis.\nNicotine, as some of you may know,\nif you listen to the episode on nicotine,\nbut even if you didn't,\nnicotine comes from the tobacco plant,\nand there are a few other\nplants that include nicotine,\nand typically it's brought\ninto the brain and body\nby smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco,\nsnuffing tobacco or vaping nicotine.\nNicotine exists in the outside world\nin these plants, the tobacco plants,\nbut the reason it has\nan effect on the body\nis that there are so-called\nnicotinic receptors in the body.\nNow, those nicotinic receptors\nwere named after nicotine,\nthe compound, but they\nexisted in the brain and body,\nnot because of the existence\nof a tobacco plant,\nbut because there are\nother chemicals in the body\nthat naturally occur, namely acetylcholine\nthat bind the nicotine receptor.\nThose chemicals, such as acetylcholine,\nthat bind the nicotinic\nreceptor in your brain and body\ncreate an enhanced sense of\nfocus, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut, nicotine from tobacco\nbinds that same receptor,\nbut with much greater affinity,\nand therefore also\ncreates a state of focus,\nbut a much greater one than we\ncan achieve without nicotine.\nSo you can see the nicotine episode\nif you want to learn more about that.\nIn a very similar way, all\nof our brains and bodies,\nfrom the time that we are\nconceived, believe it or not,\nvery shortly after conception,\nif we want to be accurate,\nvery early conception,\nwhen you were in the womb,\nand still now, if you're\nlistening to this,\nyou have what are called\ncannabinoid receptors,\nbecause you also have\nendogenous cannabinoids.\nWhat do we mean by that?\nYou have receptors, which\nare like little parking spots\nthat are present on cells\nin your brain and body,\nand what we call a ligand,\nwhich is basically just a\nchemical that's released,\nparks in that receptor\nand causes a number of\ndifferent biological effects.\nCannabis contains compounds\nthat also bind to those receptors,\nbut here I want to make a\nreally clear distinction.\nWe have what are called\nendogenous ligands,\nthose just mean chemicals from within us\nthat we make naturally,\neven if we never go\nnear the cannabis plant\nor any other source of cannabis,\nwe have chemicals that are created in us\nthat park in those receptors\nand cause biological effects\non mood, on perception,\non the immune system,\non hunger, et cetera,\nagain, without ever going\nanywhere near cannabis,\nwe have these endogenous cannabinoids.\nSo endogenous cannabinoids\nare floating around in us,\nor I should say, they are released in us\nin particular ways,\nbind to these receptors\nand cause changes in\nmood, appetite, et cetera.\nThey have many different\neffects on the brain and body,\nand we'll talk about those.\nBut just like with nicotine,\nthere are substances in the outside world,\nin this case, cannabis\ncontains these substances,\nso things like THC and like\nCBD, that when ingested\nby smoking or vaping\nor by ingesting edibles\nalso will park in those same receptors,\nthe cannabinoid receptors and\nlead to biological effects.\nNow, it's a little bit misleading,\nbecause we call them cannabinoid receptors\nas if they were there to bind cannabis,\nor just like we call\nthe nicotine receptors,\nnicotinic receptors, it makes\nit seem as if they were there\nin order to bind nicotine from tobacco,\nbut that's not the way our\nbrains and bodies evolved.\nOur brains and bodies\nevolved for these receptors\nto make use of chemicals\nthat exist within us,\ncalled again, endogenous chemicals,\nand those endogenous chemicals\nlead to certain effects,\nas I mentioned before.\nThe key thing here,\nif you haven't understood\nanything I've set up until now,\nplease understand this, the key thing is\nthat THC and CBD and the\nother components of cannabis\nbind to those receptors,\nthose endogenous cannabinoid receptors,\nthe ones that we naturally\nmake, with much greater affinity\nand exert a vastly\ngreater potency and effect\non mood and perception, et cetera,\nthan do our endogenous cannabinoids.\nAnother analogy that one could take\nin order to understand this\nwould be hormones, like\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nMany people, I would say all people,\nmake testosterone and\nestrogen to varying degrees.\nIt's going to depend on whether\nor not you're male, female,\nyour age, whether or not\nyou've gone through puberty,\net cetera, et cetera,\nbut let's just take\ntestosterone for example.\nThere's testosterone\ncirculating in your body.\nThat's true if you're male or female,\nand there are receptors\ncalled androgen receptors,\nwe could even call them\ntestosterone receptors.\nAnd the testosterone\nbinds to those receptors\nand has effects on cells.\nIt causes hair growth, changes the voice.\nIt can affect libido.\nIt affects all sorts of\nthings in the brain and body,\ndepending on which organ and\ntissue you're talking about.\nBut of course,\nthere are people that take\nsynthetic testosterone\nor derivatives of testosterone,\nand some of those derivatives,\nfor instance, in the\nbody building community\nand the sports community,\nthey will take things like Dianabol.\nThese are modified\nversions of testosterone\nthat can bind to the testosterone receptor\nwith much greater affinity,\nor I should say the androgen receptor\nwith much greater affinity,\nand have supra physiological effects,\neffects that would\nessentially never be seen\nfrom testosterone that was endogenously,\nexcuse me, endogenously\nreleased within the body.\nWe could say the same thing for estrogen.\nThere are estrogen receptors,\nthey bind estrogen,\nbut if someone were to\ntake synthetic estrogen\nor to ingest a plant compound\nthat contains various\nestrogenic compounds,\nand those plants\ncertainly exist out there,\nthey can have supra physiological effects\non those receptors.\nWhy am I telling you this?\nWell, many people believe\nthat because cannabis,\nmarijuana is a plant, and\nplants grow out of the ground,\nand they're naturally occurring,\nand because we have receptors in our body\nthat are there without\nthe need to engineer them\nfrom some external source,\nthey're in our genome.\nThey're program for it, and\nwe're born with these things,\nand we keep these our entire life.\nMany people mistakenly think,\nah, these plant compounds\nare safer for us or better for us,\nor are somehow appropriate\nfor us to ingest,\nbut that's simply not true,\nand here, I'm not saying\nthat cannabis is always\na bad idea for people.\nThere are certain populations\nand certain people\nfor which it can be relatively\nsafe recreationally,\nthat's the truth, and\nthere are other populations\nfor which it can be downright dangerous,\nrecreationally or medicinally.\nAnd of course, there\nare medicinal purposes\nthat are being explored, and\nwe'll talk more about that.\nBut this is vital to understand,\nbecause I think that when we hear,\n\"Oh, it's from a plant, it's natural,\"\nand then you also have\na receptor for these,\nendogenous cannabinoid receptors,\nand therefore, the marriage of those two,\nthe coming together of the\nchemical THC or CBD or both\nwith these receptors is\nsomehow supposed to happen\nas if this was a purpose\nof having these receptors,\nbut it's simply not the case.\nIn the same way that\nthe nicotinic receptors\nare not there because\nnicotine is good for us,\nthey're there because there are compounds\nthat exist within us that are good\nto bind to those receptors\nfrom time to time.\nNow, here's the key thing about,\nI guess today, I'm saying\nthere are a lot of key things,\nbut here's another key thing\nabout understanding cannabis\nand the way that it works,\nwhich is that THC and CBD,\nwhen they're brought\ninto the brain and body\nby smoking or edible, et cetera,\nthey bind to those receptors,\nthose endogenous cannabinoid receptors,\nand they tap into the same systems\nthat your endogenous\ncannabinoids would tap into,\nthe ones that affect mood and energy\nand creativity and relaxation, et cetera,\nbut they do so with thousand\nfold greater potency.\nAnd as a consequence of that,\nyour endogenous cannabinoids\nare outcompeted.\nThey really get no opportunity\nto interact with those receptors.\nAnd understanding that,\ncan lead to a very clear\nunderstanding of why, for instance,\nwhen people use cannabis\nto relieve anxiety,\nor they use cannabis to\nenter a certain brain state\nfor creativity or to enter sleep,\nwhy a dependence on\ncannabis starts to emerge.\nBecause if they don't ingest cannabis,\nand again, ingest could\nmean smoke to bring THC in,\nor CBD in, or ingest\norally or even transdermal\nor tincture or one of the other varieties,\nif they don't do that,\nthen what happens is\nnot only are the receptors not\nstimulated to the same degree\nor with the same potency\nthat they normally are,\nbut the endogenous cannabinoids\ncan no longer have their effect,\nso people experience\nheightened levels of anxiety,\ndisrupted mood, disrupted\nbrain state, and so on.\nNow, again, I want to be very clear\nthat I'm not trying to\npaint a picture of cannabis\nas all bad or even partially bad.\nWhat I want to do today is give you\nas much information I can\nas to how cannabis works,\nhow its different component parts work,\nhow the different types of cannabis work,\nand point to some of\nthe valid medicinal uses\nand some of the recreational uses,\nand then lay out the landscape for you\nas to who is really most at risk\nin terms of psychoactive components,\nimmune components and so on and so forth,\nso that you can make the\nmost informed choice for you.\nI am not here to tell you\nwhat to do or what not to do.\nAs I like to say, do as you wish,\nI mean, don't do as you wish\nif it harms other people or yourself,\nbut do as you wish, but\nknow what you're doing,\nso that's really my goal here.\nSo as we begin to dive\nfurther into the biology,\nI think you'll start to\nget a clearer picture\nof why cannabis is so\neffective in some context,\nbut also why it can create\nsuch massive suffering\nin other contexts because of the way\nthat it out-competes your own natural\nendogenous cannabinoid systems.\nSo let's talk about those\nendogenous cannabinoid systems,\nwhat they are and how they work,\nbecause that will give us a lens\ninto what the higher\npotency or maximum impact\nof the various cannabis\nplant varieties and strains\nin THC and CBD and so forth,\nhow and why those work.\nSo what are the endogenous cannabinoids,\nthese chemical substances\nthat everybody makes?\nYou make them, I make them.\nYou've been making them basically\nfrom the time that you were conceived,\nand you are going to make them\nuntil the time that you die.\nWhether or not they have the impact\nand the biological functions\nthat I'm about to describe\nwill depend a lot on whether or not\nyou are using your own\nendogenous cannabinoids\nto park in those receptors\nthat you also have\nfrom birth until death,\nor whether or not you are\ntickling those receptors\nor strongly activating those receptors\nusing some external source like\ncannabis and THC, et cetera.\nThe two main endogenous cannabinoids\nthat we want to consider are anandamide,\nwhich we will refer to\nas EAE, so anandamide,\nand another one, which\nis arachidonoyl-glycerol,\narachidonoyl-glycerol, which\nwe will abbreviate 2-AG.\nSo let's just take EAE and\n2-AG, lump them together\nand talk about the\nendogenous cannabinoids,\njust to make it simple.\nBut if you want to do the\ndeep dive on anadamide\nversus 2-AG, please be my guest.\nThe endogenous cannabinoids\nare released from neurons.\nWhat are neurons? Neurons are nerve cells.\nAnd nerve cells should be\nconceptualized like this.\nYou have presynaptic neurons\nand postsynaptic neurons.\nPresynaptic neurons basically\ncontain little vesicles,\nlittle bubbles full of neurotransmitter,\nwhich are chemicals,\nand when neurons are\nstimulated electrically,\nand that could be from a thought,\nit could be from the desire to move,\nit could be because of a drug,\nit could be because you're hungry,\nthe relevant neurons will vomit\nout or will fuse, as we say,\nthose little packets, those little bubbles\nof neurotransmitter into the gap\nbetween the pre and postsynaptic neuron,\nand we call that a synaptic\ncleft or the synapse.\nIt's a little gap, a little space,\nand the neurotransmitter\nflows across that synapse,\nand some of it will park\nin the little parking spots\nthat we call receptors on\nthe postsynaptic neuron side.\nDepending on which neurotransmitter it is,\nand a bunch of other things\nnot worth going into right now,\nthe parking of that chemical\nand those neurotransmitter receptors\nwill either cause that neuron\non the postsynaptic side\nto itself, release\nneurotransmitter elsewhere,\nor it will quiet it down,\nso-called excitation and inhibition.\nThat's kind of neuro\ntransmission in a nutshell.\nIf you don't understand it, no big deal.\nIt's not going to prevent you\nfrom understanding today's discussion.\nIf you understand even a small fraction\nof what I've just said,\nthen it's going to allow you to understand\nnot just today's discussion,\nbut a lot of neuroscience\nwith a lot more nuance and\ndepth of understanding.\nThe key thing to know about\nthe endogenous cannabinoids\nis that unlike most neurotransmitters,\nthey are released from\nthe postsynaptic side.\nSo what happens is neurotransmitter goes\nfrom presynaptic neuron\nto postsynaptic neuron,\nbut under certain conditions,\nthe postsynaptic neuron,\nitself, releases a chemical,\nand that chemical goes backward,\nwhat we call retrogradely,\nto the presynaptic neuron,\nbinds to receptors there\nand changes the probability\nthat the presynaptic neuron\nwill release neurotransmitter.\nPut simply, endogenous cannabinoids\ntend to decrease the probability\nthat a neuron will\nrelease neurotransmitter.\nThey're a break on the system.\nThey're a way of shutting\ndown the communication\nbetween neurons, regulating it,\nnot to make it completely quiet,\nbut to adjust the levels\nwith a lot of nuance.\nNow, the other thing that the\nendogenous cannabinoids do\nis a mind bender, because\nwe're talking about cannabis,\nand a commonly known feature\nof cannabis and marijuana consumption\nis disruptions in short-term memory,\nand there is essentially zero debate\nas to whether or not that occurs,\nand we'll talk about the\nmechanisms a little bit later.\nAnd yet, endogenous cannabinoids,\nthe chemicals that you naturally release\nfrom these postsynaptic neurons\nthat travel retrogradely back\nto the presynaptic neuron,\nactually can lead to\nstrengthening of connections\nbetween the presynaptic neuron\nand the postsynaptic neuron\nthrough a process called\nlong-term potentiation, or LTP.\nThey can also cause\nwhat's called depression of communication\nbetween a presynaptic neuron\nand a postsynaptic neuron.\nLong-term depression has nothing to do\nwith depression as a psychological\nstate or as a illness.\nLong-term potentiation\nand long-term depression\nsimply refer to the probability\nthat one neuron will be able\nto stimulate and activate another neuron.\nAnd, as I just told you,\nthe endogenous cannabinoids\ncan either turn up the dial\nor turn down the dial.\nThey can either increase the probability\nor decrease the probability\nthat a given connection between neurons\nwill function more or will function less.\nSo if you think about the\ncommunication between neurons\nas crosstalk, as a conversation,\nwell, the endogenous cannabinoids\ncan dictate whether or not\nthat conversation is likely\nto occur or not to occur.\nThink of them as either putting someone\nat the top of your text\nchain in your phone,\nwhich would be long-term potentiation,\nor essentially blocking their number,\nwhich would essentially\nbe long-term depression.\nSo, if you're getting the impression\nthat the endogenous cannabinoids\nare working in a number of different ways,\nand it's not very\nstraightforward, you're right.\nIn fact, that's the message\nthat I'd like you to take away.\nThe endogenous cannabinoids\nare sometimes increasing\nneuronal communication.\nThis can lead to increases in mood\nor increases in the likelihood\nthat someone will talk a certain way\nor behave a certain way\nor feel a certain way.\nThat can also lead to decreases\nin synaptic transmission,\nthat is communication between neurons,\nin ways that will make\nsomebody's mood lower,\nor will make them less\nhungry or more hungry.\nAnd, here's the really key thing,\nthere are two kinds of\nendogenous cannabinoid receptors,\nreferred to as CB1 and CB2,\nand we can say with confidence that CB1\nis highly enriched in the nervous system,\nand especially within the brain.\nIt's found not everywhere,\nbut almost everywhere in the brain\nand elsewhere in the nervous system,\nso spinal cord and other\naspects of the nervous system.\nCB2, the cannabinoid receptor, CB2\nis largely located in\nthe tissues of the body,\nincluding the immune system, the liver,\neven the genitals, et cetera.\nSo what this means is that\nthe endogenous cannabinoids\nare having these sorts of effects\non neurons that I talked about,\nbut they are also having\neffects on immune cells,\non reproductive organs, on liver,\non digestion, on hunger, et cetera,\nthrough mechanisms that are divorced\nfrom the function of the\nnervous system of neurons.\nNow, in reality, no system\nof the brain and body\nis divorced from the nervous system,\nbecause the nervous system\nis controlling everything.\nIt is really the master controller,\nand everything's feeding\nback to the nervous system,\nso it's a two way street.\nBut the simple way to think\nabout it is CB1 receptors\nare mainly in the nervous system,\nand CB2 receptors are mainly in the body\nand endogenous cannabinoids,\nagain, EAE, anandamide,\nand 2-AG, arachidonoyl-glycerol,\nare impacting CB1 and CB2 receptors.\nToday we're mainly going to\ntalk about CB1 receptors,\n'cause they are the ones\nthat are responsible\nfor most of the familiar\neffects of cannabis,\nbut the key takeaway at this\npoint is to really understand\nthat the major effects of\nyour endogenous cannabinoids\non these receptors in this\nparticular CB1 are very nuanced.\nIt depends on context,\ndepends on which neurons.\nIt's sometimes increasing\ncommunication between neurons,\nsometimes decreasing it, and\nthen along comes cannabis,\nand that cannabis, again,\ncan arrive by smoking,\nby vaping, by edible.\nAnd cannabis contains THC and CBD\nthat potently bind the CB1 receptor,\nand now the effects of the CB1 receptor\nbeing occupied by THC or\nbeing occupied by CBD,\nare not very nuanced.\nIn fact, they are very predictable\nand especially important is to understand\nthat they are so strong, and\nthey park in that receptor\nwith such affinity, with\nsuch force and precision\nand stubbornness and refusal\nto leave that receptor\nthat they completely outcompete\nthe endogenous cannabinoid system.\nIn fact, they leave the\nendogenous cannabinoid system\nessentially dysfunctional,\nwhich, in some cases,\nmay be a good thing, but in most cases,\nis going to lead to\nproblems of various kinds,\nand we'll talk about\nwhat sorts of problems.\nAnd again, I feel obligated to say,\nthis is not me saying don't\ningest cannabis or THC or CBD.\nThat's not what I'm saying.\nWhat I'm saying is if\nyou evaluate the potency\nthat is in technical terms,\nit would be the affinity\nwith which these compounds,\nTHC and CBD and CBN, bind to\nthese endogenous receptors,\nthat would be like a howitzer\ngun, like a cannon going off,\nas compared to endogenous cannabinoid,\nwhether or not it's EAE or 2-AG,\nwhich is more like a cap\ngun level of activation,\nat least in this analogy.\nSo now you have what at\nleast I would like to think\nis a fairly complete understanding\nof the different varieties of cannabis,\nat least at a broad sweep,\nand the different biological\neffects that they can have,\nat least in terms of the major receptors\nand in retrograde signaling,\net cetera, et cetera.\nNow, let's take a step\nback into the real world\nand evaluate or think about\nwhat happens when somebody smokes cannabis\nor ingests cannabis by way of edible\nor tincture or something of that sort.\nCannabis is very fast to\nenter the bloodstream.\nIn fact, within 30 seconds,\nit's going to enter the brain\nand permeate throughout\nthe brain and body.\nThat's very, very fast.\nI mean, when you contrast that\nwith something like\nalcohol or even nicotine,\ndepending on how the\nnicotine is delivered,\nthat is a very fast\ndelivery of the psychoactive\nand biologically active compound,\nwhich in this case is THC and CBD\nand probably some other things as well.\nSo within 30 seconds,\nit reaches the brain and bodily tissues,\nand within 30 to 60 minutes,\nit's going to reach\nits peak concentrations\nand have its peak biological effects.\nThose aren't always the same thing,\nbut in the case of cannabis,\nagain here I'm using\ncannabis as an umbrella term\nfor THC and CBD, the\neffects are going to peak\nat about 30 to 60 minutes\nafter bringing those compounds\ninto the body in some way or another.\nAnd the effects tend to last\nanywhere from three to four hours,\nalthough there's some variation on that,\ndepending on individual metabolism,\nwhether or not somebody is\nfamiliar with the compound,\nbelieve it or not,\npsychologically familiar,\nbut also biologically familiar,\nor whether or not it's a first time use\nor occasional use and so on.\nTHC and CBD and other\ncomponents of cannabis\nare highly what we call lipophilic.\nThat is, they have an affinity toward,\nand they can actually pass\nthrough fatty tissues.\nNow, every cell in your\nbody, but especially neurons,\nhave a double layer of\nfat on their outside.\nAnd of course, when people hear \"fat,\"\nthey always think, ooh, fat's bad.\nMost of the world seems to\nwant to lose fat or bodily fat.\nHere we're talking about\nthe fatty membrane,\nthe barrier around each tissue,\nin this case we're talking\nparticularly about neurons.\nAnd THC and CBD and the\nother components of cannabis\nare highly lipophilic,\nso they can get into\nessentially all cells just\nsimply by flowing into them.\nThey will also remain in\nthose cells for a long time.\nSo, I know that a number of people,\ndepending on whether\nor not they get tested\nfor work or for sport or otherwise\nfor cannabis or CBD and THC,\ndon't take this as a strict number,\nbut typically, if one ingests CBD or THC,\nsmokes cannabis, ingests\nby orally, et cetera,\ndoesn't matter, it's going\nto stay in that fatty tissue\nand can be detected for at\nleast as long as 80 days\nafter ingestion, and\nthere's a whole industry\nas to how to accelerate the clearance,\nand I should just tell you\nthat just losing bodily fat\nisn't going to eliminate\nit from your system,\nmaybe partially in those fat cells,\nbut certainly intravisceral\nfat and other fatty tissue\nthat's in around the brain and body\nis going to harbor that THC\nmolecule and the CBD molecule\nfor quite a long while, at least 80 days.\nSo, if someone smokes cannabis\nor they ingest cannabis,\nit very rapidly gets into the bloodstream,\nand the components that are psychoactive\nget into the bloodstream\nand are immediately able to\naccess neurons and other cells\nand start having these effects\nof parking at those endogenous\ncannabinoid receptors\nand impacting the\nsignaling between neurons,\nwhich leads to the subjective\neffects of cannabis,\nincluding THC and CBDs,\nso let's talk about\nwhat those different\nsubjective effects are.\nAgain, this is going to vary\ndepending on whether or not\npeople are ingesting sativa\nvarieties of cannabis,\njust to remind you, those\ntend to be elevated mood,\nalertness, talkativeness.\nPeople who take sativa varieties\ntend to talk a lot more\nthan they would otherwise.\nAgain, there are exceptions to this,\nof course there are exceptions.\nI'm sure there are people\nout there shouting,\nalthough I guess if\nyou're the quiet people\nwho don't talk too much,\nyou're probably not shouting,\nor if you're not, you're\nnot doing on sativa,\nJoe contended, but in any\nevent, there are exceptions,\nbut there are also general rules.\nAnd the sativas tend to\nmake people's mood elevated,\nenergetic, again, this sort of head high,\nand indica varieties\ntend to do the opposite.\nmore of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.\nWhy and how would they do that?\nWell, without going into\nan extensive deep dive\ninto the different\nneurotransmitter systems\nof the brain and body,\nwhat we know for sure\nis that CB1 receptors are present\non an enormous number of different neurons\nin brain structures in neural circuits,\nso that the sativa varieties\nthat act as a stimulant,\nmaking people feel happy,\n'cause in general, they\ndo tend to elevate mood,\nat least at certain dosages, talkative,\ntend to make people feel\nlike they have ideas\nthat are interesting, that\nthey might want to share,\ntend to narrow their context,\nso we tend to increase focus.\nThis is something that's not\noften discussed about cannabis,\nbut especially the sativa varieties\ncan increase people's level\nof focus to particular things,\nsomething they're watching\nor something they're doing\nor music, it allows them to\nnarrow their sense of focus.\nThat's going to occur by\nactivation of CB1 receptors\nin the so-called prefrontal cortex,\nwhich is just behind the forehead,\nand the prefrontal cortex\nacts as a strong modulator\nof so-called limbic\ncircuitry and other circuitry\nthat is more stress oriented.\nThe way to think about the\nstress and limbic circuitry,\nsuch as the amygdala, which\nmany people have heard about,\nis that they aren't really\ncircuits for fear and stress.\nThey are circuits that\nare constantly evaluating\none's own internal state,\nheart rate, et cetera,\nand what's happening\nexternally, and, sorry to say,\nbut the default of those\nsystems is to detect danger,\nso threat detection systems.\nAnd then the prefrontal\ncortex largely acts\nas a brake on those systems,\nso like the reins pulling\nback on a steed of horses\nthat would otherwise just take off.\nAnd so, the sativa varieties\ntend to increase CB1 activation\nin the prefrontal cortex\nand in other circuitry\nthat then leads to an\noverall reduction in stress,\nbecause of the way that\nprefrontal circuitry\ncan reduce activation or the amygdala.\nNow that, of course, does not explain\nwhy some people become very\nstressed and very paranoid\nwhen they smoke sativa varieties\nor other varieties of cannabis\nor ingest other varieties of cannabis.\nWe'll talk about the paranoid\neffect and why that occurs\nand who might predict\nthat would occur to them\nin a little bit.\nBut I just want to give you a\nsense of how this is working,\nbecause as I mentioned before,\nTHC and/or CBD are going\nto bind that CB1 receptor,\nlet's say in prefrontal cortex,\nthe neurons of the prefrontal\ncortex, it's going to bind there,\nand then they'll be a retrograde signaling\nback to the presynaptic neuron,\nand in the case of prefrontal cortex,\nwhat's happening is it's\nincreasing transmission,\nincreasing the release of neurotransmitter\nin the prefrontal cortex.\nHowever, at the same time,\nthe very same THC and CBD that\nwas brought into the system\nis binding the very same type\nof receptors, CB1 receptors,\nin other brain structures,\nsuch as the amygdala\nand causing retrograde signaling\nback to the presynaptic\nneurons in the amygdala,\nbut it's quieting the\nactivation of those neurons,\nso this is interesting.\nWe have the same\ncompounds, THC and/or CBD,\nbrought into the body and brain,\nbinding the same receptors, in\nthis case the CB1 receptors,\nbut depending on where\nthose receptors are located\nand which brain areas we're referring to,\nthey are either causing\nheightened levels of alertness\nand activation of\nsystems that are designed\nto make you talkative and\nalertness and mood, et cetera,\nfocus, or they're causing\nsuppression of those circuitries.\nSo we have kind of a seesaw effect here\nwhere the same compound is\nincreasing mood and alertness\nand focus in the prefrontal cortex\nand is decreasing stress\nand threat detection\nin the amygdala, and that's\none of the reasons why,\nespecially the sativa\nvarieties of cannabis,\nallow people to enter\nthese states of focus,\nsome might even say flow,\nalthough I don't want to go\ninto what flow states really are.\nThat's for a different discussion,\nand it's very poorly defined as it is.\nAnd I certainly don't want\nto give people the impression\nthat cannabis increases flow states,\nbecause that's not always the case,\nand certainly most often is\nnot going to be the case.\nBut the idea here is that this\nmolecule comes into our brain\nand is shifting everything\ntowards a state of focus,\nelevated mood of heightened\nsense of importance\nabout whatever it is that\nwe happen to be doing.\nAnd now of course, whatever\nwe could happen to be doing\ncould be writing a song, writing poetry,\ncommunicating with somebody,\nbut it could also be something as trivial\nas watching cartoons or watching a movie,\nwhich is not trivial in its own right,\nbut in terms of thinking\nabout the creative aspects\nor the creativity stimulating\naspects of cannabis,\nnot productivity oriented.\nSo narrowed focus, elevated mood,\nmore relaxed and yet energetic,\nthat's the major effects\nof the sativa varieties,\nexcept, and this is a really big boldface,\ntriple underlined 'except,'\nexcept in some individuals,\ndepending on dosage,\nbut also depending on\npreexisting neural circuitry\nand propensity for anxiety,\nsome people ingest or\nsmoke sativa varieties,\nand regardless of whether\nor not it's a type one,\ntype two or type three variety,\nregardless of the ratio\nbetween THC and CBD,\npeople will experience\nintense anxiety and paranoia.\nNow, how do you predict\nwho will experience intense\nanxiety and paranoia\nand who will experience\nintense relaxation, focus\nand sense of creativity from ingesting\nor smoking a type one, type\ntwo or type three sativa?\nWell, there is no way to predict that,\nand there's a lot of what\nI would call street lore\nor dorm room lore or not peer reviewed,\nbut peer discussed\namong friends and people\nand acquaintances lore out\nthere that what one needs to do\nis simply smoke more, or just ingest more.\nYou hear that, \"Oh, well listen,\nif it makes you paranoid,\n\"you simply need to use more,\"\nthat is absolutely categorically false.\nEverything we know about the\nway that THC and CBD work\nis that they tend to potentiate,\nthat is increase the effects\nof these different systems\nat given synapses and in different areas\nof the brain and body.\nThat is, if someone\nexperiences paranoia or anxiety\nfrom a given strain of the marijuana plant\nor from ingesting an\nedible in a particular way\nor a particular kind of edible,\nthat person is very likely\nto experience the same effect\nevery time they ingest\nthat strain or variety.\nThis is part of what's led\nto this enormous industry.\nI mean, there are a number\nof different reasons,\nbut this is part of what's\nled to this enormous industry\nof highly customized cannabis\nwhere people will spend some time\nreally seeking out the\ndifferent strains of cannabis\nand hybrids of cannabis\nthat work best for them\nand work best for them\nin particular context.\nI wish I could tell you\nthat if you are a person\nwho is between 5' 7\" and 6' tall,\nand you have blue eyes or brown eyes,\nthat the sativa varieties are\ngoing to be right for you,\nor that sativa varieties are\ngoing to give you panic attacks,\nI can't do that.\nThe only way to determine it would be\nto actually experience ingesting\nthose or smoking those,\nwhich is certainly also\nnot what I'm suggesting.\nThat's up to you.\nI'm not telling you what\nto do or what not to do,\nbut there are no good predictors.\nIn fact, if you look in the literature,\nit is not at all clear that people\nwho have a heightened level of anxiety\nwhen they do not smoke cannabis\nwill experience cannabis\nas less paranoia inducing\nor more relaxing.\nThat's simply not the case.\nNow, what we can say for sure\nis that general categories of effects,\nsuch as increased focus\nand reduced anxiety\nare largely due to activation of areas\nlike the prefrontal cortex.\nNow, unlike other compounds\nlike nicotine or alcohol\nor neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,\nwhen we talk about the cannabinoid system,\nand I say effects, biological\neffects, psychoactive effects,\nI want you to keep in mind always,\nplease, please, please keep in mind\nthat those effects can be varied\nand often opposite in direction,\nso let's just give an example of that.\nI just mentioned that when\npeople smoke or or eat sativa,\nthat it tends to lead to one specific set,\nor generally leads to one\nspecific set of effects,\nheightened focus, mood, et cetera.\nWhereas when they ingest or\nsmoke indica and its components,\nagain, we're still\ntalking about THC and CBD\nin varying ratios, but now\nindica cannabis, and you say,\n\"Well, why would it improve\nthe transition time to sleep?\"\nOr at least give people the impression\nthat it improves the\ntransition time to sleep.\nWe'll talk about what indica actually does\nfor sleep in a little bit,\nbut indica also tends\nto suppress activation\nof the amygdala and threat\ndetection centers in the brain,\nagain, binding the same CB1 receptors\nin those retrograde signaling mechanisms\nthat I talked about before,\nbut it also tends to shut\ndown the hippocampus,\nan area of the brain\nassociated with memory,\nwhich is why indica\nvarieties lead to pronounced,\nor I should say profound\ndefects in short-term memory\nand sometimes in long-term memory as well,\nif it's consumed over\nlong periods of time.\nWe'll talk about short, medium\nand long-term consumption,\noccasional consumption going forward.\nSo what I'd like you to take away\nfrom this component of the\ndiscussion is first of all,\nthe mechanism of action\nby which cannabis impacts\nthe brain and body,\nbut in particular the brain,\nis going to be through CB1 receptors,\nand those CB1 receptors can\nlead to either an acceleration\nor a brake on particular\nbiological mechanisms.\nAnd there are going to be a constellation\nof different accelerations and braking\nof different neural systems\nin the brain and body,\ndepending on whether or\nnot people ingest sativa\nor indica or some hybrid strain.\nAnd perhaps most importantly,\neven if you didn't understand anything\nthat I've said about the biology\nof these different\nstrains in the receptors,\nplease do understand that\nthere is no way to predict\nwhat the effect of a given\nstrain will be on an individual.\nThere has been extensive exploration\nas to whether or not people\nwho are so called mellower\nor more anxious or any number\nof different personality dimensions\nwill respond in one way or the other,\nbut, in fact, there is no way to tell.\nLayer on top of that the\nfact that dosing THC and CBD\ncan be fairly straightforward\nin the form of edibles,\nbecause there can be, at least\nif it's a controlled source,\na defined number of milligrams of THC,\na defined number of milligrams of CBD.\nThat's true for ingestibles.\nIt's much harder to gauge that\nfrom the smokeable forms of cannabis,\nespecially if those\nsmokeable forms of cannabis\nare obtained through sources\nwhere there isn't a lot\nof clear information\nabout the total amount\nof THC in that product.\nNow, this is all changing\nquite a lot nowadays\nbecause of the commercialization\nof of THC and CBD products\nand cannabis in a number\nof different areas,\nincluding in the United States.\nBut still, many people\nare ingesting cannabis,\nTHC, CBD through sources\nwhere they don't really know\nhow much they're bringing\ninto their system.\nAnd so, whether or not someone\ngets incredible anxiety\nrelief, enhanced sense of mood\nand focus and wellbeing,\npain relief, et cetera,\nor whether or not they have\nfull blown panic attacks,\net cetera, is very hard to predict\nbased on dosage information alone.\nNow, of course, we can\ncreate broad categories,\nand we are going to talk about studies\nthat create broad categories\nof low dose, moderate dose,\nand high dose. frequent\nuse and infrequent use,\nbut unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,\nwe can't really point to\nspecificity of X amount of alcohol,\ngrams of alcohol per week, which is safe,\nor X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.\nAnd so I know a lot of people\nout there are wondering,\nhow often can they smoke cannabis,\nor how often can they eat\ncannabis or THC or CBD\nin any number of its different\nforms and products, safely?\nWell, we have to really\ndefine what 'safely' means,\nand we have to really acknowledge\nthat there's a pretty\nloose set of controls\nover what one is bringing\ninto their brain and body\nas they ingest THC and CBD,\nbut even under conditions in\nwhich it's very controlled,\nit's very hard to predict\nwhat those effects will be.\nSo before moving into specifics\nof taking cannabis or not taking cannabis,\nwho should, who shouldn't,\nwhat the medicinal purposes are\nand what some of the newer,\nexciting data point to,\nI just briefly want to make a list,\nand I promise very briefly,\nI know I'm not often concise,\nbut I do try to be thorough for your sake.\nI want to make a very brief list\nof the different brain areas\nthat are impacted by THC and CBD\nand why THC and CBD have\nthe various effects they do.\nWhen somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,\ndoesn't matter what the\nTHC or CBD ratio is,\nif they experience deficits in memory,\nand that's almost always\npresent, that's going to be\nbecause of reductions\nin electrical activity\nwithin this brain region\nwe call the hippocampus.\nHippocampus means seahorse.\nIt's shaped like a seahorse.\nAnatomists like to name things\nafter what things look like,\nbut hippocampus memory, memory is reduced,\nin particular short-term memory.\nThat's true regardless of whether or not\none is using sativa indica or some hybrid.\nIn general, the prefrontal\ncortex is going to be activated\nby the sativa varieties, which\nis going to increase thinking\nand narrowly constrain\nfocus to some activity,\nand that's more commonly associated\nwith the sativa varieties.\nThe indica varieties,\nas I mentioned before,\ntend to lead to a suppression of activity\nin prefrontal cortex, believe it or not,\nand turn off thinking and planning.\nThis is why indica\nvarieties are often used\nfor relaxation and for promoting sleep.\nRegardless of whether or not\nsativa or indica variety,\nand again, regardless of\nthe ratio of THC to CBD,\nthere is a general\nsuppression of neural circuits\nwithin the so-called basal\nganglia and cerebellum.\nBasal ganglia and cerebellum\nare areas of the brain\nthat are involved in action\nplanning and withholding action,\nso that would be the basal ganglia,\nso-called go, no go circuitry,\nand the cerebellum, which\nis involved in balance,\nbut also motor planning\nand motor sequencing.\nThis is why people who smoke marijuana,\nregardless of the strain,\nwill tend to be less physically mobile.\nOther common effects are\nreddening of the eyes,\ndryness of the mouth,\nthat's actually caused by\nthe same general mechanism,\nwhich is a reduction in\nthe secretion of saliva\nand of tears and lubrication of the eyes\nfrom the lacrimal glands of the eyes\nbecause of the presence of largely CB2,\nbut also CB1 receptors in\nthe mouth and on the eyes.\nAnd there tends to be,\nespecially with certain\nstrains of cannabis,\nincrease in appetite, so-called munchies,\nand that has everything to do\nwith very, very high density\nof CB1 receptors in the hypothalamus,\nand in particular areas\nof the hypothalamus,\nlike the arcuate nucleus\nof the hypothalamus,\nother areas as well, of course,\nthat have tons of CB1\nreceptors, bind THC and CBD\nand activate the neurons that\nstrongly stimulate appetite\nthrough two mechanisms, one\nis a cognitive mechanism\nof creating a preoccupation with food\nin anticipation of taste,\nas well as the experience of taste.\nSo the narrowing of focus\nto what you want to go eat.\nYou really crave, I dunno, pizza.\nIt seems to be high fat,\nhigh carbohydrate foods,\nbut really crave pizza\nand narrowing of focus,\nso that you're not thinking\nabout anything else,\nbut also signaling from\nthe hypothalamus to the gut\nto neurons within the stomach, itself,\nthat regulate blood sugar,\nso there are strong effects\non blood sugar of THC and CBD\nthat generally lead to\nincreases in appetite,\nso two parallel mechanisms,\none within the brain,\none within the body, increasing appetite,\nso there's an array of different effects.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nCB1 receptors are present\nall over the nervous system\nin the brain, the spinal cord.\nIn fact, the presence of CB1\nreceptors in the spinal cord\nlargely explains the fact that\nTHC and CBD, to some extent,\nalthough it's not very well studied,\ncan provide some pain relief.\nI say some, because a\nlot of people perceive\nor believe that they\nexperience more pain relief\nfrom cannabis than they actually do.\nIt actually has a lot to\ndo with a perceptual shift\nto basically focusing on other things,\nbut there does seem to\nbe some antinociceptive,\nmeaning anti pain effects of\ncannabis, THC in particular,\nand that is exerted largely\nthrough effects on CB1 receptors\nin neurons of the spinal cord.\nSo a broad array of\neffects are taking place,\nregardless of what strain you take\nand whether or not you eat the cannabis\nor you smoke the cannabis.\nAnd the broad array of effects\ncan be explained by the fact\nthat that retrograde signaling\ncan lead to activation\nor suppression of activity\nin various neurons.\nSo now I'd like to take a step back\nfrom the biology of\ncannabis and THC and CBD\nand all the signaling\nand receptors, et cetera,\nand really just focus on cannabis use,\nand wherever possible,\nI will point to the specific\nstrains that have been studied\nand the ratios of THC to CBD,\nbut I have to say that unfortunately,\nmost studies of marijuana, of cannabis,\nwhile they have been very careful\nto detail the amount of THC,\nlow dose, medium dose, or high dose,\nand actually getting very specific,\nright down to the number of milligrams\nor even how much\ncirculating THC is present\nafter somebody smokes a\njoint or ingests cannabis,\nmost studies have not distinguished\nbetween sativa and indica strains.\nAnd that's unfortunate,\nbecause in the real world,\npeople are distinguishing\nbetween sativa and indica strains\nin their patterns of\nuse and what they prefer\nand what they don't prefer,\nor even what they prefer\nto smoke during the day\nor ingest during the day versus night.\nBelieve it or not, there are people\nwho are using certain\nstrains during the day\nand other strains at night,\nbut the science is yet\nto catch up to that,\nor I should say, more accurately,\nthe general public and the\nthemes that are emerging\nand the practices that are\nemerging around cannabis,\nespecially in states where it's\ndecriminalized or legalized,\nare occurring at such a rapid rate\nthat there's absolutely no way\nthat the science could keep up.\nThis is a naturally occurring experiment,\nnot to say that it's natural,\nlike people should do it,\nbut it's an experiment\nthat's happening in real time\nin the real world, much\nfaster than controlled studies\nwithin university laboratories\nand other laboratories can keep up.\nSo at this point, I think it's\nappropriate to ask ourselves,\nwhy do people even use cannabis?\nWhat are they trying to achieve?\nIs it always about not feeling pain?\nIs it always about reducing anxiety?\nWell, sometimes it is,\nbut oftentimes people are using cannabis\nin order to achieve a particular state.\nAnd we could use a broad brush and say,\n\"Well, they just like being high,\"\nbut while that may be true\nin a lot of circumstances,\nand I have to believe it actually is true\nin a lot of circumstances,\nthere are a lot of people who use cannabis\nin a very directed way, or\nthey get, quote unquote, high,\nin order to achieve states\nthat to them are particularly attractive,\nand one such state is\na state of creativity.\nAnd this brings us to a broader theme,\nwhich is, does cannabis\nincrease creativity?\nAnd if so, is it the THC, the CBD,\nwhat's the appropriate ratio\nor the best ratio for\naccessing creativity?\nThis is an interesting and\nimportant discussion, I believe,\nbecause creativity is one\nof the more sought after\nand more elusive states\nthat humans can experience.\nAnd yet, if you look at human evolution,\nyou look at our progression\nin terms of technology development\nand culture and music\nand poetry, et cetera,\nwe really can look to\ncreativity as the state\nthat fostered so much of that evolution.\nSo whether or not you're into technology,\nor you're into art or music,\nwhether or not you're just somebody\nwho wants to expand their understanding\nor their experience of life in some way,\ncreativity is a\nfundamentally important state\nto try and access and to\ntry and access regularly\nand to try and tap into,\nin order to eventually produce something,\nin order to create something of meaning\nthat exists not just\nin that creative state,\nbut to yourself after that\ncreative state has gone away,\nso the painting that you\npaint in the creative state\nhopefully is a painting\nthat still inspires\nand has impact after you\nexit that creative state\nand that will inspire others,\nand this could be true\nfor any number of different\nthings, not just painting.\nSo does cannabis increase creativity?\nThe short answer is, it depends.\nFirst of all, we need\nto define creativity.\nHere we are, thinking as scientists,\nif not already scientists,\nand there are basically\ntwo modes of thinking\nthat are associated with creativity,\nand they don't completely\nexplain creativity.\nBut if you look in the research,\nthe psychology research and\nthe neuroscience research,\nyou'll hear about convergent thinking\nand divergent thinking.\nConvergent thinking is taking loose ideas\nand kind of braiding them together,\nfinding a common thread, synthesizing,\nand organizing those different ideas\ninto some common or specific framework\nin order to get or create\nsome specific outcome.\nSo convergent thinking is\nbasically the person in the room\nwho's listening to all the\nideas and taking them all in.\nMaybe it's a panel of, how should we\nget a certain product out to market?\nOr what are the different motifs\nthat we should include\nin a piece of music?\nOr what should we do\nin terms of rearchitecting\na given physical space?\nTaking in those different opinions,\nthose different ideas\nfrom different people,\nand then synthesizing them and coming up\nwith one or a small\nsubset of coherent ideas\nthat incorporate some or all\nof the ones that they heard,\nso that's convergent thinking.\nIt doesn't have to involve a\npanel of people talking to you.\nI use that as an example\nof what goes on inside your own head\nwhen you are engaging\nin convergent thinking.\nYou're thinking, well,\nso and so said this,\nand I think that, and\nyou're braiding them through\nand trying to get some common themes,\nsome common vector to emerge from that.\nDivergent thinking, on the other hand,\nis best described as brainstorming.\nIt's exploring ideas\nand continuing to move\ninto the variation and\nthe vastness of ideas\nin hopes of eventually\nbeing able to converge\non some novel idea or framework.\nSo these are similar and related,\nbut typically the creativity process\ninvolves first brainstorming\nand divergent thinking,\nand then in order to arrive at something,\nto actually create\nsomething, the verb 'create,'\nnot just thinking about\nwhat you might create,\nwhich occurs during divergent thinking,\nbut actually creating\nsomething, a specific painting,\na specific song, a specific\nbody of literature,\na specific scientific project\nor experiment and so on,\nthat usually involves convergent thinking.\nNow these can be explored\nin the laboratory,\nand they can be explored\nin the laboratories\nthrough sets of different\ntypes of questionnaires\nor even tasks that you\ncan give human subjects,\nand this has been done extensively\nand across the entire body of data,\nand by that I mean,\nliterally hundreds of studies\nthat have explored the relationship\nbetween particular neuro\ncircuits and neurochemicals,\nconvergent and divergent thinking.\nWe can arrive at a principle,\nand the principle involves a molecule\nthat many of you have heard\nabout before, which is dopamine.\nDopamine is a neuromodulator.\nIt's involved in motivation,\nand it tends to direct our attention\nto things outside of us, but\nit's also closely related\nto convergent thinking\nand divergent thinking\nand to the creative process.\nAnd therefore, it should\ncome as no surprise\nthat diseases of the\nnervous system, excuse me,\nsuch as bipolar disorder,\nwhich we've done in episode\nall about bipolar disorder\nor schizophrenia or mood disorders\nthat impact the levels of dopamine,\neither make it way, way too\nhigh or way, way too low,\nstrongly impact whether or\nnot people will be creative.\nAnd I think the short takeaway\nthat makes the most sense\nin terms of framing this,\nand we covered this on the\nepisode on bipolar disorder,\nsometimes called bipolar\ndepression, is that in professions\nwhere there's a lot of creativity required\nin order to succeed, so\nagain, musicians, composers,\nartists, et cetera, you tend\nto find more manic depression,\nand manic depression,\nat least in the manic states,\nthe hyperactive states,\nare correlated with\nelevated levels of dopamine.\nLikewise, it has been seen over\nand over throughout history\nthat individuals that have\nmild forms of schizophrenia,\nor even full-blown schizophrenia,\nmany famous painters for\ninstance, or musicians,\nthey are known to have\nelevated levels of dopamine,\nand they are quite creative.\nNow, that doesn't mean\neverybody who's creative\nhas elevated levels of dopamine,\nalthough it's likely that\ntheir levels of dopamine\nare at least not diminished,\nand it doesn't mean\nthat non-creative people\nhave low levels of dopamine,\nso don't get carried away\nwith the interpretation here.\nBut the point is this,\ndopamine levels strongly\nrelate to the probability\nthat you can engage in convergent\nand divergent thinking,\nand they do so in the following way.\nWhen dopamine levels are high,\ndivergent thinking is more likely.\nThat is, when people\nhave a lot of dopamine\ncirculating in their system,\nthey tend to be very\nexpansive with their ideas,\nthey tend to brainstorm a lot,\nthey tend to be comfortable\nand even want to,\nor reflexively throw out a lot of ideas\nso that sometimes even\nseem a little disconnected.\nSome people might think of this\nas attention deficit, but it's not.\nIt's really the idea of\nthrowing out disparate ideas.\nYou hear sometimes, you\nthrow things against the wall\nand see what sticks, that's\na obviously an analogy,\nbut people are throwing lots\nof things against the wall\nand seeing what stick,\nand then seeing how the things\nthat stick fit together,\nthat's divergent thinking,\nand elevations in dopamine\ntend to increase divergent thinking.\nHowever, they tend to do this\nin an inverted U-shape way.\nFor those of you either\nwatching on YouTube,\nI'm just drawing a hump, obviously,\nand for those of you listening,\njust imagine a U, the shape of a letter U,\nand then just flip it upside\ndown, so it looks like a bump.\nTurns out that when dopamine\nlevels are very low,\nthere's a low probability\nof divergent thinking.\nWhen dopamine levels are\nhigh, as I mentioned before,\nthere's a high level or\nprobability of divergent thinking.\nBut when dopamine levels\ngo very, very high,\nthen there's again, a reduction\nin divergent thinking.\nIn other words, there's a sweet spot\nof elevated dopamine\nfor divergent thinking.\nAnd again, divergent thinking\nis critical for the creativity process,\nbecause creativity by definition\nis taking a novel set of ideas\nand arranging them in a particular way,\nor taking existing ideas and\narranging them in a novel way\nthat then you eventually converge\non some new product, new\nidea, new song, et cetera.\nNow, convergent thinking follows\na very different pattern.\nWhen dopamine levels are high,\nconvergent thinking is not very likely.\nAnd when dopamine levels are low,\nconvergent thinking is very likely.\nSo here, using arguably\na very reductionist view,\nwe're looking at all of this\nthing we're calling creativity\nthrough a very neurosciencey\nreductionist lens,\nwe can say this.\nThe creative process\ninvolves going into a state\nwhere you're willing to\nconsider a lot of options,\nmany of which seem distantly\nor not even connected to one another,\nand dopamine facilitates\nthat divergent thinking state\nin which you are perfectly happy\nand in fact, experience a\njoy, or elation, a comfort\nand a pleasure in organizing\nall these different ideas\nthat to anyone else might\nseem not that related.\nBut when your dopamine\nlevels are elevated,\nthese all seem like great ideas\nand that maybe there\nare connections there.\nYou're not accepting all\nof them as true and valid\nand interesting in combining\nthem, but there's this idea\nthat it's worth entertaining\nthe possibility,\nat least for moments.\nAnd then, as dopamine levels drop,\nthere is the process\nof convergent thinking,\nwhich is taking options\ndown off the wall saying,\n\"No, no, that doesn't fit with that,\n\"that doesn't fit with that,\n\"but ah, that fits with\nthat, and that can work.\n\"That feels right or sounds\nright or looks right.\"\nThat's the creativity process.\nAnd so, I think this is not just important\nfor understanding cannabis,\nwhich we'll get back to in a moment,\nbut it's important for\nunderstanding creativity\nand brain states in general.\nBrain states are not, as we would say,\na square wave function.\nYou don't just drop into\na trench of creativity.\nCreativity is not an\nevent, it's a process.\nAnd what I'm telling you\nis that it's a process\nthat involves divergent thinking\nand consideration of a\nlot of different ideas.\nThat's correlated with high\nbut not too high dopamine.\nAnd then, one has to\ntransition into a state\nof convergent thinking,\nwhich is really honing in\non the ideas that seem to have validity\nor that could have validity\nand getting rid of everything else,\nand that's associated with low dopamine.\nIt's more about logical\nimplementation and consideration\nas opposed to thinking about\nand considering everything.\nSo let's now return to the question\nof whether or not cannabis\nand its different components\nincrease creativity.\nAnd when you look at\nthe literature on this,\nyou find studies that very\nclearly point to a yes,\nit increases creativity,\nand it's not surprising,\ntherefore, that cannabis can\nincrease dopamine transmission,\nthat is dopamine levels,\nin certain brain areas,\nin particular brain areas\ninvolved in thinking and planning.\nSo cannabis increases\ndopamine in these areas.\nElevated dopamine increases\ndivergent thinking,\nand divergent thinking is\nassociated with creativity,\nand there are studies\nthat support the idea\nthat cannabis can increase creativity.\nHowever, there are at\nleast as many studies\nthat say that cannabis does\nnot increase creativity,\nthat cannabis increases\nconsideration of multiple ideas,\nperhaps through elevation of\ndopamine and related systems,\nbut that ultimately the\nideas that converge from that\nare not truly creative ideas,\nat least they don't meet the criteria\nfor creative brainstorming\nand extraction of ideas\nthat are truly novel,\nso it doesn't increase\ncreativity, so which one is it?\nWell, fortunately,\nthere's an entirely\ndistinct set of literature\nthat has taken all the other\nliterature into consideration,\nand here's where we arrive.\nSo there's a really nice study\nthat explored creativity\nin cannabis users,\nand we will provide a link to this study.\nFirst author is Emily LaFrance,\nand the title of the paper,\nsomewhat amusing in its own right,\nwhich is, it starts with a question,\ninspired by Mary Jane, of course,\nMary Jane being one of\nthe old school versions\nor ways of talking about\ncannabis or marijuana.\nNowadays, people refer\nto it mainly as pot,\nas other names too, of course,\nand the title of the paper is,\n\"Inspired by Mary Jane\nMechanisms Underlying\n\"Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users.\"\nAnd I really like this study\nfor a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, they looked at\npeople who did not use cannabis\nas well as people who used cannabis,\nso they had two different groups,\nbut they did not evaluate\ncreativity of the cannabis users\nwhile they were under the\ninfluence of cannabis.\nThey looked at the level of creativity\nin these cannabis users\nwhen they were not under\nthe influence of cannabis\nand asked whether or not\ntheir ability to be creative\nwas enhanced by cannabis.\nNow we're going to compare this to studies\nin which people come into the laboratory\nand actually use cannabis,\nand then they evaluate\ncreativity under that context.\nBut this study has some unique takeaways\nthat I think are really interesting.\nFirst of all, they did, yes,\nsee evidence for enhanced creativity,\nand when I say enhanced creativity,\nI mean within the context of\nthis divergent thinking thing\nthat I talked about a moment ago.\nAnd when I say enhanced,\nI mean significantly\ngreater than in non-users,\nso people that don't use cannabis.\nSo right now I can imagine\nthat all the cannabis users\nare cheering, \"Yes, cannabis\nincreases creativity,\n\"makes people more creative\nthan they would be otherwise.\"\nWell, this is interesting.\nWe have to ask ourselves\nhow that was accomplished.\nAnd it turns out that\none of the major ways\nin which it was accomplished\nis that cannabis users,\neven if they're not under\nthe influence of cannabis,\nare far more open to novel ideas,\nand they have a more\nexplorative and reduced anxiety,\nor I should say lower\nanxiety mode of thinking\nwhen they explore novel ideas,\nwhich is essential for divergent thinking.\nSo they observed both enhanced divergent\nand convergent creative type\nthinking in cannabis users.\nAnd the source of that, they conclude is,\nand here, I'll just quote,\n\"Cannabis users' higher levels\n\"of openness to experience are responsible\n\"for their enhanced\nself-reported creativity\n\"and convergent thinking\ntest performance.\"\nSo it's not necessarily that cannabis\nis increasing the capacity\nof the brain areas\nthat are associated with creativity,\nbut rather, cannabis appears\nto be increasing an openness\nand probably doing that in\npart through lowering anxiety\nin particular people, and that openness\nis leading to inclusion of more ideas\nduring the divergent thinking process.\nThey're willing to consider throwing up\nmore things on the wall to see\nif they stick, so to speak.\nSo in their conclusions, they\nhave a really nice statement.\nAgain, I'll just read from the paper,\nbecause they said it better\nthan I ever could, quote,\n\"While mainstream media\nhas propagated the idea\n\"that cannabis expands the\nmind and enhances creativity,\n\"our results show the link\nbetween cannabis and creativity\n\"is largely a spurious correlation,\"\nmeaning that it's not the case\nthat cannabis increases creativity, but,\nand I inserted the 'but' in this quote,\nbut \"driven by differences in personality\n\"that are related to cannabis use.\n\"For example, openness to\nexperience that are related\n\"to both cannabis use and\naugmented creativity.\"\nThis is a real chicken/egg\nargument. What do I mean by that?\nWhat I mean is, this paper finds\nthat people who are\nmore open to experience\nare more likely to use cannabis,\nand people who use cannabis\nare going to be more\nopen to new experiences,\nand that combination of\nfeatures, openness to experience,\nand what that openness to\nnew experiences brings,\nenhances the convergent\nand divergent thinking\nthat is characteristic\nof the creative process.\nSo in short, cannabis\nincreases creativity,\nbut through changes in personality\nthat tap into the creative process,\nrather than directly\nimpacting the neural circuits\nthat, for instance, turn on creativity.\nAnd I have to say, this\nstudy is really important,\nbecause by exploring cannabis users,\nnot while under the influence of cannabis,\nthey were able to tap\ninto this very important,\nwhat I believe to be fact.\nBecause if you think about a study\nin which you would have\none group using cannabis\nand another group not using cannabis,\nand then you give them some\ntask that taps into creativity,\nyou will see effects and very likely,\nyou'll see effects where\ncannabis might even increase\ndivergent and convergent\nthinking and creativity.\nThose results have actually been published\nmany times before.\nBut given the varied\neffects of cannabis and THC\nthat we talked about earlier,\nthrough all of that\ncomplex signaling stuff,\nyou can imagine that there\nwill also be other studies,\nand in fact, there are,\nwhere divergent and convergent\nthinking and creativity\nis not assisted by cannabis\nand might even be reduced\nby ingesting cannabis.\nHowever, if one considers\nthat divergent thinking\nis absolutely crucial to\nthe creativity process\nand the range of things\nthat one will explore\nwill be enhanced by openness\nand by reduced levels of anxiety,\nso a willingness to\nexplore different options,\nsome of which might seem completely crazy,\nand cannabis increases\nthe personality types\nand reduces the anxiety that\ncreate that sense of openness,\nwell then it makes perfect sense\nwhy cannabis would increase creativity\nin certain individuals, but not directly.\nAnd this study, the\none I just referred to,\nwhich I should say was published\nin the journal,\n\"Consciousness and Cognition,\"\nand again, we'll provide a link to it,\ndid a wonderful job of teasing out\nthis impact of cannabis on personality,\nwhich then impacts creativity.\nSo if somebody asks you,\nor if you're wondering,\nor if you feel like cannabis\nincreases creativity,\nin some sense the answer is 'yes,'\nbut the answer is 'yes'\nbecause of the ways\nthat it shapes openness to new ideas\nand can, I should say 'can,'\nbecause not in everybody,\nbut can, in some\nindividuals, reduce anxiety.\nWhat this means is that\nif you are somebody\nwho experiences anxiety or\nincreased levels of focus\nfrom cannabis, regardless of the strain,\nand here I have to imagine people\nare exploring different strains,\nif they're exploring them at all,\nexploring different modes of delivery,\nsmoking or ingestible, et cetera.\nIf you're somebody who\nexperiences anxiety,\nit's very likely that you won't\nhave the increased openness\nto experience and divergent ideas\nthat will facilitate creativity.\nHowever, if you are somebody\nwho achieves heightened levels\nof relaxation and reduced\nlevels of anxiety from cannabis,\nregardless of which strain we\nhappen to be talking about,\nwell then, yes, it will position you\nto be in a heightened state of creativity,\nat least as defined by convergent\nand divergent thinking.\nOne of the more characteristic,\nor I should say stereotype\nqualities of people\nthat smoke a lot of\nmarijuana or ingest cannabis\nthrough other means is there\nchanged patterns of speech.\nIn fact, there's a lore\nin the clinical realm\nthat you can predict or\nget some strong indication\nas to whether or not\nsomebody is a cannabis user\nor pot smoker based on their voice\nand their particular tone of voice\nand their lack of inflection.\nThere's a lot of speculation here,\nbut fortunately, it's been studied.\nSo I'd like to discuss now\nwhether or not cannabis can\nimpact patterns of speech,\nboth acutely, meaning while\nunder the influence of cannabis,\nand over time, in chronic cannabis users.\nAnd when I say 'chronic cannabis use,'\nI want to be very specific what I mean.\nChronic cannabis use\ndoes not necessarily mean\nthat people are smoking cannabis\nor ingesting cannabis every day,\nalthough certainly if they are,\nthat qualifies as chronic use.\nChronic use is regular use over time\nof anywhere from twice a week or more.\nSo using cannabis once a month\nwould not be considered chronic use,\neven if it's for many, many years.\nUsing cannabis or ingesting cannabis\nin some way or form twice a week\nwould be considered chronic use.\nThen of course, some of you out there\nare going to ask me to\nsplit hairs and say,\n\"Well, what if somebody\nuses it twice a month?\"\nWell, listen, the clinical literature,\nand the scientific literature\ndon't get that specific.\nAnd of course, they're an\ninfinite number of ways\nto arrange one's cannabis use,\neverything from zero, none at all,\nto constantly, every day, all\nday and everywhere in between.\nBut think of chronic use\nas twice a week or more.\nThink of occasional use as less than that\nand realize that within the\nrealm of chronic use, excuse me,\nthat 'or more' can be\nanywhere from twice a week,\nto every day, to just in\nthe evenings, et cetera.\nThe effects of chronic use of cannabis,\nas I just defined it, on\nspeech have been studied.\nBecause of this characteristic,\ndrawing out of certain\nsyllables, a slowing of speech,\nand in many cases a total\nchange or alteration\nin the way that people\nspeak and use language,\nboth when under the influence of cannabis\nand when not under the\ninfluence of cannabis\nif they're chronic users.\nAnd here we really want to\ndistinguish between THC and CBD\nand just make it really simple and say\nthat CBD is not responsible\nfor most of the psychoactive\neffects of cannabis,\nwhereas THC is, and again,\nthe ratio of CBD to THC is\ngoing to be relevant there,\nbut let's just think\nabout cannabis and THC\nas one in the same for this\nportion of the discussion,\nrealizing that, of course,\nthey are not exactly the same thing.\nThere's an excellent study entitled,\n\"Adults with History of\nRecreational Cannabis Use\n\"Have Altered Speech Production,\"\nand we will provide a link to that,\nfirst author, Adam Vogel,\nreally like this paper.\nIt was published in the journal,\n\"Drug and Alcohol Dependence.\"\nWe will provide a link to it for you\nif you'd like to peruse it in more detail.\nThe title itself, \"Adults\nwith a History of Recreational\n\"Cannabis Use Have Altered\nSpeech Production,\"\ntells you pretty much\neverything you need to know,\nexcept there's some\nimportant nuance in here,\nbecause, as I mentioned earlier,\npeople who smoke sativa\nvarieties of cannabis\noftentimes will become more\ntalkative, much more talkative.\nHowever, whether or\nnot people tend to rely\non sativa cannabis use\nor indica cannabis use,\nthere is a very consistent finding\nthat people who are chronic users,\nagain twice a week or more,\nrecreational use or medicinal use,\nundergo pretty profound changes\nin the way that they speak,\nbut in a very specific set of ways.\nNow, first of all, the changes in speech\nshouldn't surprise us at all,\nbecause both sativa varieties of cannabis\nand indica varieties of cannabis\nimpact those brain centers\ninvolved in movement,\nthe basal ganglia, remember\nthe go, no-go circuitry,\nthe circuitry that makes\nyou want to do things,\nand the circuitry that makes\nyou want to withhold action?\nAnd it tends to shift the body and brain\ntoward more inaction.\nAnd cannabis impacts CB1\nreceptors in the cerebellum,\nwhich is involved in motor\nplanning, execution and balance.\nSo, regardless of whether or not people\nare using cannabis of the\nsativa or the indica variety,\nthere are disruptions in motor circuitry.\nAnd, as you may have heard,\nif you listened to our episode\nwith Rockefeller professor,\nDr. Erich Jarvis,\nwho works on speech and\nmovement, speech is movement.\nThe movements of the mouth,\nthe movements of the hands,\nthose are intimately related\nin terms of our speech.\nIn fact, the centers of the\nbrain involved in hand movements\nare part of the speech\nareas and vice versa.\nErich actually pointed out\nthat if you put your\nhands behind your back,\nprovided you normally do\nhave use of your hands,\nit actually will reduce\nyour fluidity of speech,\nand so I'm going to put them\nback in front of me now.\nThe point is, smoking marijuana\nor consuming marijuana\nby edible changes one's speech\nand does it in a very specific way.\nAnd in this study by Adam\nVogel and colleagues,\nthey explored a huge different\nvariety of aspects of speech.\nAnd this can be done\nusing spectral processing,\nwhich is fancy nerd speak\nfor looking at how much\ninflection there is\nor looking at how long people hold vowels\nor consonants, et cetera, and again,\nthese are people not under\nthe influence of cannabis,\nbut rather people who tend\nto be under the influence\nof cannabis when not\nparticipating in the study,\nin other words, chronic\nrecreational cannabis users.\nSo what are the two major\nshifts that cannabis causes\non our patterns of speech?\nWell, the first one is a change\nin what's called spectral tilt.\nAgain, that's fancy nerd speak\nfor vocal effort and intensity.\nSo, I'm not a pot smoker, I confess,\nbut if I were to say the sentence,\n\"Vocal effort and intensity\n\"are important components of speech,\"\nthat's the way I would say that sentence\nif I was striving to\nenunciate very carefully\nand to accent certain words and syllables.\nA pot smoker or somebody who\nuses recreational cannabis\nfairly often would have\nreduced spectral tilt,\nAKA, vocal effort\nintensity, and might say,\n[mumbling] \"Spectral tilt is\nvocal effort in intensity,\n\"and it differed between\ngroups and appeared to change\n\"in line with the duration of\nabstinence from cannabis use.\"\nThat I think is not a far cry\nfrom the change in spectral\ntilt that they observed here.\nIn addition, there are\nchanges in verbal timing,\nthat is pronunciation of words\nand accenting particular\nsyllables of words\nin people that consume\ncannabis or smoke cannabis.\nSo rather than emphasize\nparticular words within a sentence,\nso again, I'll just use\na sentence from the paper\nso that you can gain more\nknowledge from the paper,\n\"Cannabis,\" and I'll say it\nthe way that I would say it,\nsince I'm not a cannabis user.\n\"Cannabis, marijuana, is\nthe most commonly used,\n\"illicit drug in the world with\napproximately 4% of adults,\n\"aged 15 to 64 years reporting recent use,\n\"and the citation is from\nthe United Nations Office\n\"on Drugs and Crime, 2019.\"\nSo that would be the way\nthat I would typically read that sentence.\nAnd having gone into\nthe data on this paper,\nand of course evaluated references therein\nand listened to some of\nthe spectral analysis\nthat they include as data,\nyou can literally go\ninto these papers online\nand hear recordings of\npeople who are cannabis users\nor non-cannabis users,\nand I'll try and give you a a clear sense\nwithout picking an extreme\nexample of how somebody\nwho's a fairly consistent or\neven occasional cannabis user\nmight read that very same sentence.\n\"Cannabis, marijuana, is\nthe most commonly used\n\"illicit drug in the world\nwith approximately 4% of adults\n\"age 15 to 64 years reporting recent use,\n\"and the citation comes from\nthe United Nation Office\n\"on Drugs and Crime in 2019.\"\nNow you'll notice that\nwasn't a dramatic difference.\nAnd, of course I could\nhave taken the liberty\nto pick an extreme example of the sort\nthat they did occasionally observe\nin evaluating subjects for this paper.\nI could have said something like,\n[mumbling in low tone]\n\"Cannabis, marijuana,\n\"is the most commonly used illicit drug,\"\nbut frankly that would've been\nselecting an outlier example,\nand I don't want to do that.\nI don't want to skew the data as they say.\nRather, if you heard the\nfirst time I read the sentence\nand the second time I read the sentence,\nwhat's mainly different is the difference\nin the amount of enunciation and accenting\nof particular words and\nsymbols within a sentence.\nSo the total content that's\ndelivered is exactly the same,\nand while I wasn't measuring my pace,\nthe overall rate of communication\nis essentially the same,\nbut there's less lilting\nand falling of the voice\nand less accenting.\nThat's the major consistent\neffect of cannabis use.\nNow of course, there\nare examples of people\nwho are using a lot of cannabis,\nand it impacts brain centers\ninvolved in movement and speech,\nso much so that they really do have\nthe really drawn out kind of, nah,\nand oftentimes this will\nbe detected in the laugh.\nThere's this stereotypical stoner laugh,\nas it's sometimes called.\nRather than say \"Ha, ha, ha\"\nor that's a fake laugh, obviously.\nIt's hard to make myself laugh\nif something's not actually funny.\nI'll have to think of something funny.\nWhen people say like, \"Ha!\"\nThat's a bit more of\nthe way I might laugh,\nlike, \"Ha,\" sort of the inspiratory laugh\nor the, \"Ha,\" which is expiratory laugh.\nPeople who use cannabis chronically\nwill often do that, \"Haa,\"\nwhich is the back of the throat,\n[laughs raspingly] it's\nneither inspiratory\nnor expiratory laugh,\nand believe it or not,\nthere's an entire literature\non inspiratory, inhaling,\nversus expiratory laughs,\nand there's also a literature on cannabis\naltering the pattern of\ninspiratory and expiratory laughs.\nIt almost sounds like a sarcastic laugh\nwhen, in fact, they may not\nbe feeling sarcastic at all.\nAnd I have a very close\nfriend and colleague\nwho's a phenomenal\nneurosurgeon and neuroscientist\nby the name of Dr. Eddie Chang.\nHe's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,\nand his lab and him\nare expert in the study\nof neuroscience controlling\nlanguage and speech.\nAnd he often tells me that he can predict,\nwith almost certainty,\nwhether or not somebody\nis a regular cannabis user\nbased, not just on the patterns\nof speech that they use,\nbut even just by recording\nspecific neurons in their brain\nthat underlie the laugh reflex\nand certain patterns of speech.\nSo this idea that cannabis\nuse changes your ability\nto speak and enunciate clearly\ndoes appear to be true.\nAnd the stereotype that cannabis use\ntends to create more of a drawl\nor, if you will, a laziness in the laugh,\nand some of the reflexive\nenunciations that people use,\ndoes also appear to be true.\nAnd I say all that, of\ncourse, with the caveat\nthat many people out there\nwill know individuals\nor perhaps you,\nyourselves, are individuals\nthat may use cannabis but that\nhave incredible articulation,\nprobably better than mine\nand better than other people out there\nwho speak for a living, so I'm not saying\nthat 100% of people that\nuse cannabis regularly\ncan't speak well or clearly.\nThat's simply not what I'm saying,\nand I don't want to\ncommunicate that idea at all,\nbut it is the case that people\nwho are regular cannabis users\nare impacting the neural\ncircuits involved in movement.\nMovement also controls speech,\nand therefore, cannabis\nis impacting speech.\nNow I'd like to turn our attention\nto whether or not cannabis\ncan increase sexual activity,\nsexual desire, and/or sexual function,\nso we're going to be talking\nabout libido, about sexual desire\nand about effects of cannabis on hormones.\nAnd while this might\nsound like a discussion\nthat's purely oriented towards\nrecreational use of cannabis,\nthat is people using\ncannabis to heightened\nor increase their sense of\narousal for sexual activity,\nit actually ventures into\nthe clinical realm too,\nmeaning there have been\nexcellent peer-reviewed studies\nthat I'll describe to you in a moment\nexploring the use of cannabis\nor THC, more specifically,\nfor something called hypoactive\nsexual desire disorder,\nwhich refers to a persistent\nor recurrent deficiency\nor absence of sexual\nfantasies and thoughts\nand/or desire for, or\nreceptivity to, sexual activity.\nThis is a disorder that is fairly common,\nanywhere from 6% to 9% of\npeople, both males and females.\nIt used to be considered higher prevalence\nin females than in males,\nbut now those numbers\nseem to be evening out.\nSo basically, there are\nanywhere from 6% to 9%\nof people out there who have\nvery diminished sexual desire.\nAnd so, a number of those people\nare interested in figuring out ways\nto increase their amount of sexual desire,\nand of course, there are people\nin the general population\nwho may not have hyperactive\nsexual desire disorder\nwho are interested in using\ncannabis recreationally\nin order to increase their desire for,\nor their experience of, sexual activity.\nNow first we have to acknowledge\nthat sexual desire and activity\nis a complex set of processes,\nmeaning it's not just\none event, sex, the verb.\nIt involves arousal, it\ninvolves sex, the verb,\nand it involves a whole set of\nmindsets and emotional states\nthat vary tremendously\nbetween individuals.\nBut once again, we can distill\nout a few basic principles,\nand I should emphasize,\nthese are by no means the only chemicals\nand neuro circuits\ninvolved in the sexual arc,\nas we'll call it, desire,\nthe act of sex, et cetera,\nbut they are central to\nit, they are vital to it.\nThey would be considered\nwhat I would call necessary\nbut not sufficient,\nso there'll be other\nchemicals involved too,\nbut the main chemicals in neuro circuits\nare those involved in dopamine,\nso the so-called\nmesolimbic reward pathway,\nin particular, a brain structure\ncalled nucleus accumbens,\nwhich we'll talk about more in a moment,\nis vital to all motivated\nbehaviors and to the seeking out\nof all particular types of\npleasurable experiences,\nand sex is no exception.\nSo when we hear that the\nnucleus accumbens is activated,\nthat almost always means that dopamine\nhas been released in that area\nand other areas of the brain body,\nand we can consider dopamine central\nto the desire for,\npursuit of, an act of sex.\nIn addition to that, there\nare molecules like oxytocin,\nwhich are involved in pair bonding,\nand they're going to be\nneural circuit specific\nto the oxytocin circuitry,\nbut in terms of sexual\narousal and sexual behavior,\nit's really the dopamine pathway\nin this nucleus accumbens,\nwhich are especially vital.\nThat allows us to address the question,\ndoes cannabis increase, decrease,\nor have no effect on sexual desire\nand/or the ability to have sex?\nAnd therein, we will find\nsome very interesting answers,\nand because, once again,\nit will point to the fact\nthat the effects of cannabis\non different individuals\ncan be highly divergent,\nmeaning in one set of individuals,\ncannabis will make them far less anxious.\nAnd in another set of individuals,\nthe same strain of cannabis,\nat the same dosage,\nwill make them extremely anxious.\nThe same can be said\nalso of sexual activity.\nAnd this was beautifully illustrated\nin the context of sexual\ndesire in the journal,\n\"Psycho-pharmacology,\" in\na paper published in 2017.\nThe title of this paper is,\n\"Individual Prolactin Reactivity\n\"Modulates Response of Nucleus\nAccumbens to Erotic Stimuli\n\"During Acute Cannabis\nIntoxication, an fMRI Pilot Study.\"\nSo I'll give a little bit of definition\nto some of the terms in the title\nthat will make it easier for\nyou to understand the paper,\nbut then I'll just march\nthrough the results,\nbecause they're very straightforward\nand easy to understand\nand very interesting.\nfMRI is just functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging,\nso basically subjects in this experiment\ncame into the laboratory.\nThey were either people who\nhad not used cannabis before\nor who had used cannabis before.\nThey were placed into a brain scanner,\none of these fMRI devices.\nIt looks like a tube that\npeople are backed up into\nand then they can view images in there,\nand their brain can be imaged\nwithout having to remove any skull\nor drill into the skull, no neurosurgery.\nThe participants in\nthis study were grouped\naccording to whether or\nnot they had experienced\nany aphrodisiac effects\nduring the intoxication with cannabis,\nso that would be the first group, Group A,\nthey literally called it\ngroup A for aphrodisiac.\nAnd then the second group,\nand this is the only thing I\ndon't like about this study,\nis rather than call it group B,\nthey called them 'group non A,'\nwhich just gets a little confusing.\nSo I'll try and simplify all this.\nThere are two groups,\nand one group experiences sexual arousal\nwhen under the influence of\ncannabis, THC specifically.\nThe other group does not.\nAnd it turns out this is a very\ncommonly observed divergence\nof effects of cannabis.\nSome people experience\na lot of sexual arousal\nfrom cannabis and THC in\nparticular, and some people do not,\nin fact, they experience\nsuppression of sexual desire,\nand it's always been a\nlittle bit mysterious\nas to why that is.\nWell, in this study, they showed people\nin both groups erotic images,\nand they measured sexual arousal\nthrough a number of different measures.\nWe won't go into all that.\nIt was largely subjective.\nThere have been other studies\nwhere they've actually measured things\nlike erections in males and\nvaginal lubrication in females,\nso-called autonomic responses\nthat people can't lie about,\nso to speak, and that\ntap into other aspects\nof the so-called sexual arousal process.\nIn this study, they\nalso took blood samples\nto look at the concentration\nof things like cannabinoids,\nso this is a really nice study\nin that they actually\nmeasured how much THC\nwas in the bloodstream\nin different individuals\nwho reacted to these erotic\nstimuli in different ways.\nAnd they measured\nhormones, namely cortisol,\nwhich is a stress hormone,\nwhich tends to negatively correlate\nwith sexual arousal and prolactin.\nAnd the interesting\ntakeaway from the study was\nthat for people, and it didn't matter\nif it was males or females,\n'cause they looked at both,\nfor people that experienced\nelevated prolactin levels\nunder cannabis intoxication,\nthat's how they refer to it.\nPeople take cannabis,\nthey measured prolactin.\nSome people had elevated\nprolactin and some people did not.\nFor the people that had\nelevated levels of prolactin,\nthey did not observe activation\nof brain areas associated\nwith sexual arousal,\nin this case, the right nucleus accumbens,\nso you have two nucleus accumbi,\nI guess they would be called,\none on each side of the brain,\nand the activation of that brain area\nis strongly associated with\ndopamine and with arousal\nand sexual arousal in\nparticular in this study,\nand if people had elevated prolactin,\nthey did not experience\nactivation of nucleus accumbens,\nand they did not report\nfeeling sexually aroused\nto those pictures, at least\nnot to the same degree\nas the other group.\nSo some people's prolactin levels go up\nwhen they ingest cannabis,\nand those people do not\nachieve elevated levels\nof sexual arousal when under\nthe influence of cannabis,\neven if they're looking at erotic stimuli.\nThat makes sense, because prolactin\nis mutually inhibitory, as we would say.\nIt's kind of in a push-pull with dopamine.\nWhen dopamine levels are high,\nprolactin levels tend to be low,\nand when prolactin levels are high,\ndopamine levels tend to be low.\nThe other group, so-called Group A,\nthat experienced elevated\nlevels of sexual arousal\nwhen under the influence of cannabis\nand viewing erotic stimuli,\nthat group did not show\nelevated levels of prolactin\nin response to cannabis.\nSo this, I believe,\nresolves a longstanding\ncontroversy in the field,\nwhich is, does cannabis\nincrease sexual arousal?\nWell, it depends.\nIf you fall into the category of person\nwho has elevated levels of prolactin\nin response to cannabis,\nthen no, actually cannabis\nwill suppress your sexual\nresponse and desire.\nIf, however, you are in\nthe category of person\nthat does not have elevated\nlevels of prolactin\nin response to cannabis,\nwell then, erotic stimuli can potentially\nand in fact, do increase sexual arousal\nin the majority of individuals.\nNow, many of you are probably hearing this\nand wondering whether or not you fall\ninto one category of\nindividual or another.\nAnd the key thing here to understand\nis that levels of prolactin\nheading into the study\ndid not predict whether or\nnot people would respond\nto cannabis with elevated or non elevated\nor even reduced levels of sexual arousal.\nIt was whether or not people's\nprolactin levels went up\nor did not go up, that predicted\nwhether or not their levels\nof arousal would go up or not.\nSo if you are somebody who, yes,\ndoes experience elevated\nlevels of sexual arousal\nand function went under\nthe influence of cannabis,\nwell that's very likely that cannabis\ndoes not increase your prolactin levels,\nat least not to a significant\ndegree while you're taking it.\nAnd if you're somebody who\ndoes not experience increases\nin sexual arousal or function\nor even diminished sexual\narousal and function\nwhen under the influence of cannabis,\nit's very likely that cannabis\nis increasing your levels of prolactin.\nUnfortunately, there's\nno way to know or predict\nbased on some other measure.\nI think the outcome measure,\nthat is increased or not increased\nor even reduced sexual arousal\nis really the litmus test\nby which one can figure that out.\nWhile we are on the topic\nof the effects of cannabis\non sexual function and\nhormones like prolactin,\nit's probably worth mentioning\nthat cannabis has been studied extensively\nfor its impact on other hormones,\nand we can summarize those\nliterature in the following way.\nAnd here I'm referring to\nstudies only on adults.\nWe'll talk about the\ndeveloping brain and body\nin a little bit, but it is very clear\nthat smoking cannabis\nincreases prolactin levels.\nVery, very clear.\nNow, you might say, \"Didn't,\nyou just describe a study\n\"about a set of individuals\nwhose prolactin didn't increase\n\"and as a consequence,\n\"their level of sexual desire went up?\"\nYes, there are a subset of individuals\nfor which that's true, but\npeople who smoke cannabis\ndo experience increases in prolactin,\nand that's especially pronounced in people\nthat smoke cannabis\nmore than twice a week.\nSo this is important, prolactin,\nas I referred to earlier,\nis reciprocal or mutually\ninhibitory with dopamine.\nOne way to think about\nthis is in the context\nof the normal sexual arousal arc\nwhereby dopamine is increased\nwhen people are sexually\naroused, but then after orgasm,\nboth in males and females,\nprolactin levels skyrocket.\nThis is actually what creates\nthe so-called refractory period for males\nduring which they cannot\nachieve erection again\nfor some period of time.\nThat relates directly to how long\nthe prolactin increase lasts.\nProlactin is also increased\nin new parents of all species,\nincluding humans, which\nat least partially,\nexplains some of the reported\nor typical reductions\nin sexual desire and\nactivity in new parents.\nNow, there are other reasons for that too,\nsleep deprivation, but nature is smart\nand has arranged a set\nof hormones and circuits\nin the brain and body,\nsuch that when tending\nto a newborn is the most\nimportant thing, it relegates,\nit reduces the importance\nof producing more children\nand sexual activity in those moments\nand days and weeks, sometimes longer.\nSo when prolactin levels are\nup, dopamine levels are down.\nSmoking marijuana more than twice a week\nsignificantly increases prolactin.\nThere are fewer studies exploring\nwhether or not edible\nmarijuana has the same effect,\nalthough the preliminary evidence\nsuggests that it does not.\nI get into this in a lot more\ndetail in a future episode,\nall about hormones with Dr. Kyle Gillett,\nwho's been on this podcast before.\nBut he verified that, and\nmy read of the literature\nis that the edible forms\nof marijuana, cannabis,\nprobably again, let's put\nan asterisks next to this,\nbut it appears do not have as as much\nof a prolactin elevating effect\nand therefore, not as much of\na dopamine suppressive effect\nand therefore, not as much\nof a testosterone suppressing effect,\nand that gets to the\nissue of testosterone.\nDoes cannabis, marijuana\nsuppress testosterone?\nAnd this is a very controversial\nliterature and here's why.\nSome studies say, \"Yes,\nit suppresses testosterone\n\"in males and females,\" and keep in mind\nthat testosterone in\nfemales is vital for libido\nand cognitive function,\ncellular repair, et cetera,\nso it's not just important\nin males, of course.\nHowever, other studies say that cannabis\ndoes not decrease testosterone,\nand it seems to depend on\nwhether or not the cannabis\nis brought into the system\nby way of smoking or edible.\nAnd it seems to depend on\nwhether or not the cannabis\nis used chronically by\nan individual or acutely.\nAnd here I just want to zoom out and say\nthat studies on cannabis or\ndrugs of any kind in humans\nare really complicated.\nIf you think about it,\nsomeone has to come into the laboratory,\nand let's say you want to\nstudy chronic cannabis use.\nWell, you can't keep them in\nthe laboratory all the time,\nso you have to rely on their self-report\nof how often they use\ncannabis and in what form,\nand you can't really control\nfrom one individual to the next\nof how much cannabis and THC\nthey're bringing into their system.\nOne person might smoke\ncannabis out of a bong\nand take big, deep, lungs-full\nbong inhalations or such.\nOther people might smoke joints.\nOther people might use edibles.\nIt becomes very complicated\nto know what people have done\nand that they're reporting it accurately,\nand no joke here, especially if marijuana\nis impacting the\nshort-term memory systems.\nThey might not actually remember.\nThey might not be tracking it that well.\nContrast that with\nstudies of the acute use\nof cannabis and THC, where\npeople who are not regular users\ncome into the laboratory and now suddenly,\nwith institutional guidelines\nand safety protocols,\nare under the influence\nof THC and cannabis.\nWell, now you're dealing with a person\nwho may not have experience\nwith the elevated heart rate\nand blood pressure that's\ncharacteristic of cannabis,\n'cause it is a stimulant,\nat least when initially\nbrought into the system,\neven if it might eventually\nlead to relaxation.\nSo now you've got someone who's anxious\nor somebody who's not\nanxious, who's deeply relaxed,\nand you're trying to study these effects,\nso it's a moving target of sorts,\nand it's very complicated to\nstudy marijuana and cannabis\nin its various derivatives in this way.\nNow you can probably appreciate better\nas to why there's so little nuanced data\nabout sativa versus indica,\nversus different ratios of CBD and THC.\nIt's really difficult to do these studies\nin the first place.\nThat said, the general rules\nare smoking marijuana increases\nprolactin in men and women,\nwhich will reduce\ndopamine and testosterone.\nSmoking marijuana chronically,\nmeaning more than twice a week,\ndoes appear to reduce\ntestosterone significantly\nand elevate so-called aromatase enzymes,\nwhich are the enzymes\nthat convert testosterone into estrogen.\nThis might partially explain the effect\nthat occurs in about 35% of\nmales, which is gynecomastia,\nwhich is a development of\nbreast tissue in males,\nin particular young males,\nwho have elevated levels of testosterone\nor who are taking exogenous testosterone\nfor testosterone replacement therapy\nor if they're taking high\ndoses, anabolic steroids,\nor in females, the\nincrease in breast size,\nwhich is due to additional estrogen\nfrom testosterone converted to estrogen.\nSo it does appear that\nmarijuana and cannabis\nincrease estrogen, reduce\ntestosterone, increase prolactin,\nespecially in chronic users.\nNow, I'm sure that some\npeople out there will say,\nwell, their testosterone\nlevels are exceedingly high\nor they are fine, meaning\nthe constellation of symptoms\nassociated with low testosterone\nand elevate estrogen\nare not present in them.\nThat probably means one\nof two things, or both.\nThey either had elevated\nlevels of testosterone\nto begin with, so their\nceiling was higher,\nso bringing it down didn't\nhave that much of effect,\nor that they have very low levels\nof aromatase in their system.\nThere are some anecdotal evidence\nthat smoking particular\nparts of the marijuana plant,\nin particular, the seeds,\ncan increase aromatase\nin the conversion of\ntestosterone to estrogen.\nI think in the old days,\nthe lore was the seeds make you sterile,\nand I think that was related\nto what I just told you,\nthis increase in conversion\nof testosterone to estrogen.\nThere's a vast literature\non the effects of cannabis on fertility.\nYes, it does seem to alter sperm motility\nand sperm health and function\nwhen taken chronically,\nmore than twice per week,\nin particular high doses\nof high potency THC.\nThis is something we will\ncover in far more detail\non a future episode all about fertility.\nAnd in females, there's\nan increase in estrogen\nas a consequence of smoking marijuana\nand increasing prolactin\nand estrogen in parallel.\nWhether or not that's\ndetrimental isn't clear,\nalthough I point out that\nelevated estrogen and prolactin\ncan be associated,\nagain, can be associated,\nnot necessarily, and\ncertainly, not causative,\nbut can be associated with elevated levels\nor frequency of breast cancer detection.\nSo cannabis and its effects on hormones\nare not without consequence.\nThere are effects of cannabis\non cortisol in some individuals.\nIt greatly increases\ncortisol due the anxiety\nand paranoia it can create,\nand in other individuals\nit reduces cortisol.\nAgain, we have these divergent effects.\nBut I want to be very clear,\nthe effects on prolactin,\nmeaning elevated prolactin,\nthe effects on testosterone,\nmeaning, at least most studies point to,\nreduced levels of testosterone\nand increased estrogen.\nThat seems to be true\nfor most all individuals\nthat chronically use cannabis,\nwhereas the effects on\ncortisol tend to be divergent.\nCannabis increases cortisol\nin some individuals\nand decreases cortisol in others.\nIn general, increases in\ncortisol that are ongoing\nare not healthy for us and so on.\nAnd then of course, there are\nother effects on hormones,\nand I'll just briefly summarize those,\nthat THC in particular, not\nCBD, but THC in particular,\nis known to be strongly inhibitory\nfor something called\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone.\nThis is a hormone that's\nreleased from the brain,\nfrom the hypothalamus\nthat then feeds onto,\nor I should say signals\nto the pituitary gland,\nwhich is also near the roof of your mouth,\na lot of stuff happening\nnear the roof of your mouth\nit turns out, biologically,\nand reduced levels of\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone\ncaused by cannabis use,\nreduced levels of LH luteinizing hormone\nand FSH, which reduce\nlevels of testosterone\nand sperm production in males\nand egg health and ovulation\nand menstrual function in females.\nNow, I'm sure there are a\nnumber of women out there\nwho will say they have perfectly\nnormal menstrual cycles\ndespite using cannabis.\nI'm certainly not going to dispute that,\nbut if you are somebody who's\ntrying to maximize fertility\nor regulate or balance hormones,\nmarijuana and cannabis reduces GnRH.\nThat is the gonadotropin-release\nfrom the hypothalamus\nand thereby reduces luteinizing hormone\nand follicle stimulating hormone,\nwhich are released from the pituitary\nand travel in the bloodstream\nto support normal ovarian\nfunction and health\nand normal testicular function and health\nin females and males, respectively.\nUp until now I've been\ndiscussing the biological\nand psychological effects of cannabis.\nNow I'd like to shift our attention\nto some of the negative\nhealth effects of cannabis\nand shine light on some of the individuals\nor groups out there that\nneed to be especially wary of\nand probably avoid cannabis use entirely,\nincluding ingestion of\ncannabis by way of edible.\nAnd I frame things that way,\nbecause I think there is an\nincreasingly large number\nof people out there that\nappreciate that smoking tobacco\nor smoking cannabis, vaping tobacco,\nyes, vaping tobacco, or vaping cannabis,\neach and all have negative\nhealth consequences on the lungs\nand on the so-called\nendothelial cells of the body,\nthe cells that make up the vasculature,\nthe capillaries and blood vessels.\nIf you don't already know\nthis, I'll make it very clear,\nand I'll make it very brief.\nWhether or not you smoke or\nvape tobacco or cannabis,\nyou are severely impairing the\nfunction of endothelial cells\nthat make up the capillaries\nand blood vessels\nof your brain and body,\nand that is known to decrease\ncognitive capacity over time,\nincrease probability of strokes,\nseverely impact lung function,\nand also lead to things like\nperipheral neuropathies.\nIt leads to sexual dysfunction,\nbecause of lack of blood\nflow to the genitals,\ncan lead to other aspects\nof reproductive damage,\nincluding to the ovaries and testes.\nEssentially, there is no\nother way to state it,\nexcept that smoking and vaping\nhave negative health consequences\nthat are independent of the substances\nthat people are trying to\nget into their bloodstream\nby smoking or vaping.\nSo people smoke and vape tobacco,\nand people smoke and vape\ncannabis, and in both cases,\nif we just set aside the\ndirect effects of tobacco\nand the direct effects of cannabis,\nwe can confidently say that\nthe process of smoking,\nof inhaling smoke into the lungs,\nand yes, also vaping,\nbringing the chemicals\nthat transport nicotine,\nor in this case, cannabis,\ninto the lungs by way of vaping\nare both severely detrimental\nto endothelial cells.\nI think a few years ago, when\nvaping wasn't as prominent,\nthere was this question and this idea\nthat maybe vaping was\ngoing to be far healthier\nor at least not as bad as smoking,\nbut now we can see a huge number\nof negative health effects of vaping,\nsome of which are distinct\nfrom the effects of smoking.\nSo if you'd like more information\non smoking versus vaping,\nplease see the episode\nthat I did on nicotine.\nWe will also do an entire episode\nall about vaping in the future,\nbut there's really no way\nto slice it and dice it\nor candy coat it.\nThe fact of the matter\nis that smoking has clear\nand severe negative health\nconsequences, regardless of\nwhether or not you're smoking\ntobacco or cannabis, THC,\nand vaping has negative\nhealth consequences,\nwhether or not you're using\nthe vape to bring in nicotine\nor THC or some combination of THC and CBD.\nThat's simply the way it is.\nWith that said, now I'd\nlike to focus our attention\non the direct effects that cannabis has,\neither by way of THC action\nor by way of CBD action\nin terms of positive or\nnegative health effects\non the brain and body, and\nwe're going to explore that\nfirst as a function of age.\nAnd the reason we're going to do that\nis related to a fact that I mentioned\nat the beginning of the episode,\nwhich is that the CB1\nand the CB2 receptors,\nthe two receptors for cannabis\nto which THC and CBD and CBN\nand all other psychoactive\ncompounds of cannabis bind to\nto have their actions are\npresent throughout development.\nBelieve it or not,\nthey are present very\nsoon after conception,\nand the CB1 and CB2 receptors\nactually play a critical role\nin the development of the fetus.\nNow, you might wonder why that is,\nbecause of course, the developing fetus\ndoesn't necessarily expect to see cannabis\nor to be exposed to\ncannabis and THC and CBD.\nBut, as you recall, endogenous\ncannabinoids are present\nin the adult brain and body\nand endogenous cannabinoids,\nit turns out, are also present\nin the developing fetus.\nIn fact, endogenous\ncannabinoids are present\nat much greater levels\nin the developing fetus\nthan they are after a child is born,\nand levels of endogenous cannabinoids\nactually go down across development.\nI find this really interesting.\nWhat this means is that\nendogenous cannabinoids\nand activation of the\nCB1 and CB2 receptors\nare an integral part\nof neural development,\nand this is going to\nbecome especially relevant\nin considering whether\nor not pregnant mothers\nshould or should not use cannabis or CBD,\nand it also points to some\nvery interesting biology\nin terms of how the brain develops\nand how the body develops.\nNow the development of the brain\nand nervous system and body\nis a fascinating and vast literature,\ncertainly far too vast to\ncover in today's episode,\nespecially at this late hour as it were,\nbut we will have a future episode\nall about brain development.\nIn terms of the effects of cannabis,\nit's sufficient to say\nthat cannabinoid receptors\nare present and active\nin the developing fetus.\nThey're present and active in the newborn.\nThey're present and active in adolescence.\nAnd across that time, from\nconception until adolescence,\nendogenous cannabinoids\nare mainly responsible\nfor the actions of those\ncannabinoid receptors.\nDuring that time, the\ncannabinoid receptors\nare having very specific effects\nthat are distinct from\ntheir effects later in life,\nand those effects can largely be explained\nin terms of neural development.\nAgain, we don't have time for\nan entire lecture on this now,\nbut during development,\nyour body was a collection\nof a bunch of cells.\nIt's actually called a blastula,\nwhich means a ball of\ncells, and then those cells\nactually have to grow out connections\nand duplicate themselves,\nand this is a very interesting process\nby which neurons initially\nare situated far apart,\nand then they grow out connections\nand make contacts with one another.\nThey remove certain connections,\ndepending on what kind of\nlife events you're exposed to.\nIf you have a wonderful\nevent early in life\nor a traumatic early life,\nthose connections change, et cetera.\nThe important point for today's discussion\nis that the CB1 receptor, in particular,\nis expressed on every neuron\nin the developing brain\nand has been shown to be important\nfor every aspect of neural development,\nfrom the proliferation of cells,\nmeaning getting enough\ncells to create a brain,\nto the outgrowth of the so-called axons,\nthe little wires that connect\nup neurons with one another,\nto the steering, the direction\nwhich those axons go in\ndevelopment, which is essential,\nand even so far as to\nexplain the connections\nthat form between neurons,\nthe so-called synapses,\nand then how those synapses work.\nSo the basic statement here is\nthat endogenous cannabinoids\nand CB1 receptor activation are critical\nfor every aspect of brain\nwiring and development.\nWith that in mind, the\nstatement I'm about to make\nis absolutely terrifying, at least to me,\nand frankly, it should be\nterrifying to you as well.\nAnd the statement is,\nthe current statistics\non cannabis use in pregnant\nmothers is absolutely shocking.\nThe most recent survey of pregnant mothers\nin the United States\nshow that 15%, one-five,\n15% of pregnant mothers\nreport using cannabis\nin some form or another, either smoking it\nor more likely ingestion of in edible,\nbecause they are aware\nof the negative effects\nof smoking on the developing\nfetus, ingestion of an edible\nto increase THC and/or\nCBD during pregnancy,\nwhich to me, I have to say,\nas a developmental neurobiologist\nis, frankly, it's scary.\nIt's absolutely scary,\nbecause that CB1 receptor\nis not just a minor player\nin neural development.\nIt is absolutely central\nto every critical aspect\nof brain wiring and development.\nNow, the long-term implications\nor even the short-term\nimplications of this,\n15% of mothers self-reporting\nthe use of cannabis\nat some point during\npregnancy are not yet known.\nThis is, as we would say, an\nexperiment that's ongoing.\nBut I'd be remiss if I\ndidn't point out these data\nand just implore you,\nplease, please, please,\nif you are pregnant or\nconsidering getting pregnant,\nyou're a cannabis user, whether\nor not you're using edibles,\nif you're a CBD user, please\ndo whatever is necessary\nto not ingest cannabis or smoke cannabis\nor ingest CBD during pregnancy.\nNow, there may be certain\nclinical indications\nby which your physician and your OB/GYN,\nand the pediatrician that will eventually\nbe the pediatrician for your\nchild will prescribe CBD,\nalthough it's hard to\nimagine what those are.\nI contacted a number of different\npediatricians and OB/GYNs\nand not a single one said\nthey would ever suggest,\nand in fact would strongly\ndiscourage their patients\nfrom using cannabis during pregnancy.\nBut I think that the advent\nof edible forms of cannabis,\nand the combination of THC\nand CBD in certain products,\nand the fact that most\npeople view CBD as safer,\nbecause it does not include,\nor does not have, I should say,\nthe psychoactive effects that THC does,\nhas led to a situation where you have 15%\nof pregnant mothers using cannabis\nat some point during pregnancy\nand maybe even frequently\nthroughout pregnancy,\nand the effects on the developing fetus\nare completely unknown.\nBut recall that cannabis\nand THC and CBD outcompete,\nmeaning they park in the receptor\nfor endogenous cannabinoids\nand prevent endogenous cannabinoids\nfrom having their normal\nlevel and pattern of action,\nso this is absolutely critical.\nI cannot encourage you enough,\nor rather, I should say,\nI cannot discourage\nenough the use of cannabis\nand any related compounds in cannabis,\nedible or smoked, certainly not smoked,\nbut even edible during pregnancy,\nand certainly in breastfeeding,\nlactating mothers,\nthe same is also true.\nRecall that cannabis and THC and CBD\nare incredibly lipophilic.\nThey're fat soluble,\nand they get into cells very readily,\nand they cross the blood brain barrier.\nThey cross the blood placental barrier.\nSo when I encountered this statistic,\nI had to kind of wipe my eyes a few times.\nI could not believe it, and\nyet I crosschecked that number\nwith a few other studies.\nA few others have come\nin a little bit lower\nat somewhere like 13% to 14%,\nand a few have come in\na little bit higher,\nbut the average of 15% is\nboth striking and shocking,\nso I don't know how to make\nthe message more clear.\nI hope that is clear.\nPlease do not use any cannabis, THC\nor related things including\nCBD, smoked or edible\nif you're pregnant, lactating, et cetera.\nNow we are at the point\nwhere we need to consider\nsome of the negative\nhealth effects of cannabis\nthat have been well documented\nin peer-reviewed studies.\nAnd before I do this,\nI want to return to a\npoint that I made earlier,\nwhich is that nothing I am about to say\nrelates directly to issues of legality.\nIf we consider alcohol, for instance,\nalcohol is legal in\nmost areas of the world.\nIt's certainly legal in the US,\nand yet there's an age limit for its use.\nTypically, it's not available to people\nuntil they're 21 or older.\nIt's not to say that\ncertain people don't use it\nbefore age 21, but it's not legal.\nIt is illegal to buy or possess alcohol,\nconsume alcohol before age 21,\nand I think with good reason,\nbecause the brain is still developing.\nLikewise, we can have a informed\ndiscussion about cannabis\nand its various components\nthat can fully acknowledge the reality,\nwhich is that one of the major\nharms of cannabis in the past\nhas been the legal ramifications\nof cannabis being illegal.\nThat's a statement that is\nno longer controversial,\nand this is not a discussion\nabout legalization or non legalization.\nIf you look to the scientific literature,\nthe epidemiological literature,\nthere are wonderful data\nout of Carleton University\nand elsewhere in Canada showing that\nmany of the negative\neffects of marijuana and THC\nare due to the criminal\njustice system, itself,\nthat is the creation of\nillicit drug businesses,\nthe creation of organized crime,\nthe creation of a number\nof different features\nrelated to the illegality of cannabis.\nAnd again, this isn't the\ntopic of today's episode,\nbut that should be acknowledged.\nAnd at the same time,\nwe need to acknowledge\nthat when a compound, a drug\nor whatever you want to call it\nbecomes legal, there's\na tendency to assume\nthat it's safe and safe for everybody.\nAnd with respect to cannabis\nand THC and perhaps even CBD,\nbut certainly for THC and\ncannabis that's smoked or vaped\nor consumed in edible form,\nthat is simply not the case.\nThere are clear data pointing\nto negative health effects\nof cannabis use and THC use,\nwhich again, is not to say\nthat there are not positive effects\non mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.\nThose are out there and they exist,\nand we will mention\nsome of those of course,\nand we've talked about some of those,\ncreativity for instance, et cetera.\nBut if we do not acknowledge\nthe negative health effects\nthat are documented in the literature,\nthen we are overlooking\nsome very important data,\nespecially as it relates to\nthe development of psychosis\nin certain individuals.\nSo, with that said, there\nare very strong data,\nand I will provide links\nto these resources,\npointing to the fact that for people\nwho are chronic users of cannabis,\nthat is using it twice a week or more,\nthat over time, their levels\nof anxiety actually increase,\nand this is true even for individuals\nthat are using strains of cannabis,\nthat while under the influence\nof cannabis, reduce anxiety.\nOver time, meaning over the\ncourse of 12 or more months,\nthere is a well-documented\neffect of the anxiety relief\nthat cannabis and THC initially brought,\nbeing less and less potent.\nThat is people need to smoke\nmore of it or ingest more THC\nin order to achieve the same\nlevel of anxiety relief,\nand in some cases, a\nswitch from anxiety relief\nto increase in anxiety,\nand again, that's increase in anxiety,\nnot just when the drug\nis not being consumed,\nbut also while under the\ninfluence of the drug.\nWhy would that be?\nWe have to go back to our\nunderstanding of the CB1 receptor\nand the potency with which THC\nbinds to that CB1 receptor.\nWhen THC is brought into the\nsystem over and over again,\nmeaning twice a week or more,\nthe binding of THC, that CB1 receptor,\neventually causes a\nhabituation or attenuation\nof the entire process\nof binding the receptor\nand creating the psychoactive effects.\nSo initially it creates anxiety relief,\nbut over time, the affinity for\nthe receptor doesn't change,\nmeaning it can still park in that slot\nwith a lot of affinity, a lot of strength,\nbut there are fewer receptors available,\nand then the signaling that's\ndownstream of those receptors\nbecomes less and less robust.\nNow this is a topic we didn't get into\nin too much detail today,\nbecause I didn't want to include\neven more biological\ndetail, but the CB1 receptor\nis a so-called G protein-coupled receptor.\nThat's a mouthful, but a\nG protein-coupled receptor\nbasically is like a bucket brigade.\nSo while some receptors\nin the brain and body\nare such that when something,\na chemical binds to them,\nthat receptor has a direct action,\nlike it opens and allows\nstuff to rush into the cell,\nincreases the excitability of the cell,\nso called fast effects,\nthese G protein-coupled receptors,\nand CB1 is a G protein-coupled receptor,\nthey are more like a bucket brigade\nwhere they kick off a\nprocess through one molecule\nthat then is handed\noff to another molecule\nthat then is handed off\nto another molecule.\nIt's a long chain or cascade of events.\nThose long chains or cascades of events\nhave a lot of opportunity for\nregulation, for adjustment.\nReceptor systems in the brain and body,\nespecially receptor systems\nlike the cannabinoid system\nthat are used to being\ntickled, not punched,\ntickled by endogenous cannabinoids,\nevery once in a while\nsome binds, has an effect,\nbut certainly not bound\nwith incredible potency\nand over and over again as they are\nwhen THC is coming into the system.\nWell those systems eventually, over time,\nthey adjust themselves so that the body\nand those cells can achieve\nso-called homeostasis.\nSo when people are using\nTHC more than twice a week,\nwhat ends up happening is those\nG protein-coupled receptors\nin the downstream signaling mechanisms\nstart to adjust themselves,\nand it requires more and more drug,\nso either higher dosages\nor more frequent use,\nand a lot of the positive effects,\nthe so-called decrease in anxiety,\nincreased focus, increased creativity,\nsome of that starts to wane,\nit starts to dissipate,\nand people wonder why they\nhave to use so much cannabis\njust to achieve a fraction of the effect\nthat they used to be able to\nachieve with even a lower dose.\nSo anxiety is getting worse over time,\nand that's anxiety during the drug use\nand outside of the drug use.\nSome people work around that\nor try to work around that\nby using varying strains of cannabis\nor changing the pattern of\ndelivery from smoking to vaping\nor from vaping to edible and\nfrom edible to transdermal.\nAnyway, they go through\na lot of gymnastics\nand writhing and seeking,\nbut nonetheless, anxiety\nincreases over time.\nAlso, it's very clear that\ndepression increases over time\nand especially, this is surprising to me,\nbut especially for individuals\nthat were not depressed\nat the the outset of their use.\nIn other words, they\ndidn't start using cannabis\nbecause they were depressed,\nbut rather the depression starts to emerge\nas a consequence of the\ncannabis and THC use.\nSo that's serious, in fact, we now know,\nbased on really solid\nepidemiological evidence,\nthat depression is not a strong predictor\nof seeking out cannabis.\nIt doesn't drive terribly many people\nto seek out cannabis use,\nbut cannabis use, itself, makes\npeople four times likelier\nto develop a chronic major depression.\nSo anxiety is increasing,\ndepression is increasing,\nand this turns out to\nbe especially relevant\nand important to young people.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, if you look at the data,\nand again, I think some\nof the strongest data\nare data to come out\nof the Canadian system.\nThey've done some really\nbeautiful controlled studies.\nI really hope to invite some of the people\nwho arranged and ran those studies\nas guests onto the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nBut if you look at the data out of Canada,\nor you look at some of the data\nout of Northern Europe and the US,\nwhat you find is that the probability\nthat somebody will use cannabis\nand then go on to use it chronically,\ncorrelates very strongly with age.\nSo for instance, some of the\nhighest degree of cannabis use\nis among individuals 16 to 24 years old.\nIn fact, in individuals\nwho are 16 to 24 years old,\nand in particular, in students\nand people who are working,\nsurprising, more than in\nunemployed populations,\nbeing young, 16 to 24, at\nleast to me that's young,\nand being a student or\nworking doubles the likelihood\nthat somebody is going to use\ncannabis on a regular basis,\ntwice or more per week.\nThe typical age of initiating\ncannabis use nowadays\nis about 19 years old, so 18.7,\nand about 20% of people\nin that age bracket,\nof 16 to 24 years old,\nare using cannabis daily,\neither by vaping, by smoking or by edible.\nThat's an enormous number,\nat least by my read.\nIt's an enormous number,\nand here's why it's of\nreally serious concern.\nDuring the ages of 16 to 24,\nthe cannabinoid receptors\nare still available.\nThey are not being as strongly driven\nby endogenous cannabinoids,\nbut by ingestion of THC and/or CBD,\nthere are downstream effects\non the signaling within those cells\nthat all the data point\nto creating a much,\nmuch higher likelihood of\ndeveloping major depression,\nsevere anxiety or psychosis at later ages.\nSo to be very clear, cannabis use,\nbetween the ages of 16 to\n24, in both males and females\nis increasing anxiety,\nincreasing depression\nin the immediate years and\nwithin the one year's time or so,\nso much so that people are\nusing the cannabis ongoing\nin an attempt to reduce that anxiety\nand reduce that depression,\nbut in addition to that, the cannabis use,\nand because of the signaling\nmechanisms involved\nare predisposing those individuals\nto psychosis later in life.\nIf you look at individuals\nwho start using cannabis,\neven younger, age 14,\nor even as young as 12,\nthe probability of\npsychosis later in life,\nin particular schizophrenic\nor schizophrenic-like episodes\nmore than doubles, so this\nis of really serious concern,\nand this is completely aside\nfrom any so-called positive effects\nor beneficial effects of cannabis\nthat people might derive from\noccasional use as adults,\nmeaning people older than 25.\nSo for the person who's older than 25,\nwho eats an edible every once in a while,\nor who smokes cannabis\nevery once in a while,\nand people love to make the argument,\nit's not as bad as alcohol,\nwhich frankly, is a terrible argument,\nbecause if you saw our episode on alcohol,\n[laughs] alcohol is pretty bad,\nbut even so, it's just\nnot a good argument.\nIt's saying that something is good,\nbecause it's not as bad as something else\nis simply just not a\ngood or valid argument,\nat least not biologically speaking.\nThe use of cannabis in young populations\nis very strongly predisposing\npeople to psychotic episodes,\nand we know the mechanism\nby which this occurs.\nThis occurs by a thinning of\nthe so-called gray matter,\nand it's called gray matter\nbecause with neurons,\nnerve cells, they have\na so-called cell body,\nthat's the part that contains the DNA\nand manufacturers all the\nneurotransmitters, et cetera.\nAnd those are shipped out to\nthe other parts of the neuron\nthat include the axon,\nthe wires between axons,\nand those axons under the microscope,\nbecause they have a lot of\nfatty tissue around them,\nand this is healthy fatty tissue\nthat allows electrical\ntransmission to be fast,\nthat fatty tissue, those\nportions of the cells,\nare called white matter,\nso you have gray matter and white matter.\nGray matter are the so-called cell bodies\nwhere the DNA and all the\nstuff is manufactured.\nWhite matter or the axons or the wires\nthrough which all the key\ncomponents are shipped out\nto the synapse, et cetera.\nWonderful data and I do say wonderful,\nbecause it is part of a\nlarge scale consortium,\nand we will provide a link to the paper.\nThis was published in\n\"Translational Psychiatry\"\njust this year, point to the fact\nthat adolescent cannabis\nuse accelerates the thinning\nof the prefrontal cortex and\nthe gray matter in particular.\nSo what this means is, while\nduring normal development,\nthe gray matter, the prefrontal cortex\nand all the cells there\nare indeed intended,\nit's a normal process for it to thicken\nand then thin a little bit\nas connections are adjusted\nand people learn and mature and grow up,\nthis is part of the normal\nhealthy maturation process,\nindependent of cannabis use.\nWhen kids, 'cause these\nreally are kids, use cannabis,\nand it doesn't matter the\nmode of cannabis delivery,\nwhether or not it's vaping\nor smoking or edible,\nthat gray matter thins at\na much, much greater rate.\nAnd the reason I like this paper published\nin \"Translational\nPsychiatry\" this year so much\nis that they link the\namount of cannabis use,\nheavy, moderate, light or no cannabis use,\nto the rate of prefrontal\ncortical thinning,\nand it's absolutely clear from these data\nthat the more often young people,\nmeaning individuals between\nthe age of 14 and 25,\nthe more often they consume\nor smoke or vape cannabis,\nthe faster and the more extreme\nthat cortical thinning is.\nAnd the cortical thinning is occurring\nin exactly the area of the brain\nthat's involved in planning,\nin control over one's emotions,\nin reflexes, in organizing one's life\nin a number of different ways,\nanywhere from cleaning\none's room, literally,\nknowing what goes where,\nto making plans that\nextend out through the day,\nthrough the week, through a year,\nessentially becoming a\nfunctional human being\ninvolves using your prefrontal cortex\nin a variety of different contexts\nand different time domains,\nthe time domain of an hour,\nthe time domain of a day.\nMaking plans and being\nable to execute plans\nis fundamental to being\na healthy human being,\nand it's absolutely clear from these data\nthat the more cannabis one uses,\nthe more impaired those\nneural circuits are.\nThere's simply no other\nway to to view these data.\nIn fact, so much so, that even\nsmall amounts of cannabis use\nare associated with rates\nof cortical thinning\nand degrees of cortical thinning\nthat are really detrimental\nand concerning for normal\ncognitive processes.\nIf you were somebody who smoked marijuana\nor consumed cannabis\nin any form or another\nduring adolescence, does that mean\nthat your prefrontal cortex\ncan never be rescued,\nthat it can't come back?\nWell, the short answer is,\nit probably can be rescued to some degree.\nIt will depend on how much\ncannabis you were using\nand how often and what strains\nof cannabis, et cetera.\nThere's really no traveling back in time,\nas my graduate advisor used to say.\nTime machines are broken.\nAt least for now, we\ndon't have time machines.\nSo all you can really\ndo is try and emphasize,\nfirst of all, quitting\ncannabis in any form\nand focusing on behaviors that\nemphasize endothelial cell\nblood flow health to the brain,\nso that would be cardiovascular exercise,\nadequate nutrition, not smoking nicotine,\nand there are a number of\nother things that one can do.\nWe will do an entire episode\nall about trying to reverse\nthe effects of cannabis\nand other drug use during adolescence.\nWe don't have time to do a\ndeep dive on that right now,\nbut all the things that\nstandardize and promote health,\nadequate sleep, good social connection,\nregular cardiovascular and\nweight training exercise,\nhealthy nutrition, and what\nthat represents to you,\nhealthy metabolic function\nand weight, et cetera,\nthose are all going to\nfacilitate some recovery\nof brain function, in particular,\nprefrontal cortical function,\nby way of all the positive effects\nthat those behaviors and choices have.\nBut with that said, if\nyou are in the age bracket\nthat I've been referring to,\nthis 14 to 25 year old age bracket,\nand you are a occasional even\nor chronic cannabis user,\nyou should be very, very\ncareful and concerned\nabout the long-term effects\nthat that could potentially have.\nThat statement is bolstered\nby another statistic,\nwhich is that unlike a lot of other drugs,\nthe rate of cannabis\nuse is strongly related\nto how dangerous people\nperceive cannabis to be.\nNow, that might seem\nobvious, on the one hand,\nif you think something\nis very, very dangerous,\nyou would expect that the probability\nthat somebody would use it\nwould be very, very low,\nand if they think something is safe,\nthe probability would be high.\nBut that isn't necessarily the case.\nIf you think about it,\ncannabis is a unique instance\nin which nowadays we are hearing,\nyes, it's becoming legal\nin a number of areas,\nand we talked earlier about why\nthat's probably a good thing\nin most circumstances,\nbut that we aren't just\nhearing that cannabis is safe,\nor it's not just being implied\nthat cannabis is safer,\nbut many more people are talking\nabout the positive effects of cannabis\nwithout a lot of discussion\nabout the negative effects of cannabis.\nAnd I realize that saying this\nis going to upset some people out there,\nbecause I know that there\nare a number of people\nwho fought very hard for\nthe legalization process,\nand I want to acknowledge that.\nI also want to acknowledge the\nmany known positive effects\nof cannabis in adults\nwith very occasional use,\nprovided it is delivered\nsafely and in the safe context\nand setting and with legality.\nThat is entirely distinct from the issue\nof whether or not cannabis is safe\nfor the developing brain and body.\nAgain, I'm not demonizing\nanybody for using cannabis,\nbut I want to make the point\nvery simply and very directly.\nIt is far and away a different\ncircumstance for the brain\nfor an individual to be 25 years or older\nand using cannabis in whatever form,\noccasionally or maybe even frequently,\nthan it is for a young\nperson, aged 14 to 25,\nto be using cannabis,\neither by smoking or vaping\nor by edible or any other\nform, on the brain and body.\nIt's absolutely clear that\nthe brain continues to develop\nat least until age 25, and\nthat a huge number of systems\nrelated to mood regulation,\nso-called executive function,\nthe ability to organize one's thoughts,\nplan and execute plans,\nessentially to become a\nfunctional human being,\nthat's one portion of becoming\na functional human being,\nbut certainly an essential one.\nAll of that relies on the fine tuning\nof this neural circuitry\nthat we've been talking\nabout up until now,\nand it's abundantly clear that cannabis\nand THC in particular, dramatically\ndisrupt those processes.\nSo if this isn't clear enough,\njust from my statements,\nI'd like to point to a particular paper.\nThis is one of the more impactful papers\nin this area in recent years.\nThis is a paper published in\n\"Lancet Psychiatry\" in 2022.\nTitle is \"Association of Cannabis Potency\n\"with Mental Ill Health and\nAddiction, A Systematic Review.\"\nThere are a number of\nvery important points\nin this very fine paper.\n\"Lancet Psychiatry\" is one of the premier\nmedical journals out there,\nand they evaluated a\nhuge number of studies.\nThey actually looked at\nmore than 4,000 studies.\nThey selected the ones that\nwere only the most rigorous\nin terms of study design and analysis\nand rigor of conclusions, and\nthey looked at how early use\nof cannabis impacted later\nprobability of development\nof psychosis and other\npsychiatric conditions,\nand the takeaways from\nthis study are very clear.\nFirst of all, chronic cannabis use,\nso more than twice per\nweek, has consistently\nbeen associated with\nmental health disorders.\nI'm pulling some phrases\ndirectly from the paper.\nHeavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis use\nmore frequent than twice per week,\nhas been associated\nwith four times the risk\nof psychosis later in life, in particular,\nschizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.\nNow, we've done an episode\non bipolar disorder.\nIt's also called bipolar depression.\nWe have not yet done one on schizophrenia,\nbut both bipolar disorder\nand schizophrenia\nhave a very, very strong\ngenetic component.\nThere's a 30, three-zero,\n30 times greater likelihood\nthat you'll have bipolar disorder\nif you have a first relative\nwho has bipolar disorder.\nAnd then, it's also the\ncase that using cannabis,\nespecially during adolescents\nand the teen years,\nand up until age 25,\ncreate a four times\ngreater risk of psychosis\nfor those that have a predisposition\nto bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia.\nNow, I don't hear very much\nabout this in the media.\nThis paper got some attention\nand then it got swept away.\nI don't think that was an\nintentional sweeping way.\nThere's just a lot of events\nin the world as you well know.\nBut I think it's a particularly\nimportant set of findings,\nbecause obviously, in\nlooking at so many studies,\nit distills out the strongest\nfindings that are out there\nand really pulls the consistent messages\nthat are arriving from all\nthese different studies.\nAnd as they point out, and\nagain, I'm paraphrasing here,\nthis is the first systematic review\nof the association of cannabis potency,\nand all of the data point\nto a very clear conclusion,\nwhich is the more potent\nthe THC concentration,\nthe higher probability\nof developing psychosis\nor a major depressive episode\nor a major anxiety disorder later in life.\nThat should be of particular\nconcern, because we know,\nwe are absolutely clear about the fact\nthat with the advent of all\nthese new strains of cannabis,\nand with the engineering\nand availability of cannabis\nat much higher potency,\nmeaning THC potency,\nthe risk of psychosis is going up and up\nand is likely to continue going\nup unless something is done\nto reduce the frequency of\ncannabis use to zero, ideally,\nor to very low frequency, very low potency\nin adolescence and teens and\npeople age 25 or younger.\nI know a lot of people don't\nwant to hear this message,\nbecause first of all, it's alarming,\nand second of all, as I mentioned earlier,\nthe statistics tell us that\nthe greatest number of people\nthat are starting to use cannabis\nare in the age bracket of 16 to 24.\nMany of them are functional\nin other areas of life.\nThey're students, they\nare employed, et cetera.\nBut when you couple that with the fact\nthat the most frequent\nadopters of cannabis use\nare in this age bracket of 16 to 24,\nthey're twice as likely to\nuse as other individuals\nor to start using cannabis\nas are other individuals.\nPlus, the general perception out there,\nbecause of the way that\ncannabis is discussed\nin the media and by sports\nfigures and by celebrities\nand by politicians, et cetera,\nthat it's not as bad as\nalcohol and maybe not that bad\nand maybe even has health benefits,\nthen you're essentially\nsetting up a system\nwhere young people are far more likely\nto adopt and continue cannabis use\nwithout realizing these\nserious health consequences\nthat await them later.\nWith all of that said, I, of course,\nagain want to acknowledge\nthat there have been\nwell-demonstrated effects of\ncannabis for reducing pain,\nin particular in chemotherapy\nand in the context\nof reducing nausea in people suffering\nfrom cancer or chemotherapy.\nThere is a well-known effect\nthat one can generally\npoint to as positive,\nusing cannabis for things like glaucoma,\nfor lowering intraocular pressure\nand offsetting the loss of neurons\nthat would lead to blindness,\nalthough there are other tools, of course,\nthat don't involve cannabis use\nthat can accomplish that as well,\nso called intraocular pressure\nlowering drugs or drops.\nThere is a list of probably\na dozen or more psychological\nand bodily ailments that can\nbe aided by cannabis use,\nin particular edible cannabis\nuse of particular strains.\nI, of course, am going to address each\nand every one of those in\nepisodes where I'm talking,\nfor instance, about eye\ndisease or about chronic pain.\nI am in no way, shape or form\ntrying to rob the incredible\nefforts of the laboratories\nand people that have worked very hard\nto study and establish\nthe valid uses of cannabis\nfor treating various ailments\nand that continue to study\ncannabis in order to try\nand ameliorate the symptoms\nof different ailments.\nBut today, I really wanted\nto emphasize the biology of cannabis,\nsome of the often discussed effects,\nI guess one could call\nthem positive effects,\nthings like enhanced creativity\nand really point to the nuance\nand actually the divergence\nof people who take cannabis\nand some experience\nheightened levels of\ncreativity and some do not.\nSome people experience heightened\nlevels of sexual arousal\nand some people experience\nthe exact opposite,\nand so on and so forth,\nrather than focus on all\nthe potential positive\nand emerging positive data about cannabis\nin different medical contexts.\nAnd at the same time, I strongly\nfeel that it's important\nto acknowledge the shocking,\nbecause there's really no\nother way to describe it,\nthe shocking effects of cannabis\nuse on the developing fetus\nand the fact that so many pregnant\nand lactating mothers are using cannabis.\nI mean, that number 15% still\nhas me dizzy with disbelief,\nand yet we need to acknowledge this\nand address this immediately.\nAnd I think it's vital to\nunderstand that cannabis use\nthrough any delivery mechanism,\nsmoking or vaping or edible or otherwise,\nis very, very concerning,\nin fact, dangerous to\nthe developing brain,\ncertainly for the fetal\nbrain and for the baby brain,\nbut also for the adolescent brain\nand for the teen and young adult brain,\nnot just because of the effects\nthat it can have in the immediate term,\nthose slow creeping increases\nin anxiety and depression,\nbrought on by cannabis use,\nbut also the time release, if you will,\non the development of\npsychosis and other types\nof major psychiatric\ndisorders later in life.\nI acknowledge we've covered\na lot of ground today,\nand yet there's
