    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr Casey Halpern Dr Halpern is\nthe chief of neurosurgery at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of\nMedicine his laboratory focuses on\nbulimia binge eating disorder and other\nforms of obsessive-compulsive behaviors\nnormally when we hear about eating\ndisorders or obsessive-compulsive\ndisorders of other kinds the\nconversation quickly migrates to\npharmacologic interventions and\nserotonin or dopamine or talk therapy\ninterventions many of which can be\neffective\nThe Halpern laboratory however takes an\nentirely different approach while they\nEmbrace pharmacologic and behavioral and\ntalk therapy interventions their main\nfocus is the development and application\nof engineered devices to go directly\ninto the brain and stimulate the neurons\nthe nerve cells that generate\ncompulsions that cause people to want to\neat more even when their stomach is full\nin other words they do brain surgery of\nvarious kinds sometimes removing small\nbits of brain sometimes stimulating\nsmall bits of brain with electrical\ncurrent and even stimulating the brain\nthrough the intact skull that is without\nhaving to drill down beneath the skull\nin order to alleviate and indeed\nsometimes cure these conditions today's\ndiscussion with Dr Halpern was an\nabsolutely fascinating one for me\nbecause it represents the Leading Edge\nof what's happening in modification of\nbrain circuits and the treatment of\nneurologic and psychiatric disease for\ninstance they just recently published a\npaper in nature medicine one of the\nPremier journals out there\nentitled pilot study of responsive\nnucleus succumbings deep brain\nstimulation for loss of control eating\nthe nucleus that Cummins is an area of\nour brains that we all have in fact we\nhave two of them one on each side of the\nbrain that is intimately involved in the\nrelease of dopamine for particular\nmotivated behaviors and while most often\nwe think about dopamine for the release\nof behaviors that we want to engage in\nin this context they are using\nstimulation and control of neuronal\nactivity in nucleus accumbens to control\nloss of control eating something that\nwhen people suffer from it despite\nknowing they shouldn't eat despite not\neven wanting to eat they find themselves\neating so again this represents really\nthe Leading Edge of where Neuroscience\nis going and certainly is going to be an\narea of Neuroscience that's going to\nexpand in the years to come and Dr\nHalpern and the members of his\nlaboratory are among a very small group\nof scientists in the world that are\nusing the types approaches that I\ndescribed a minute ago and that you're\ngoing to hear more about in today's\nepisode in order to resolve some of the\nmost difficult and debilitating human\nconditions during today discussion you\nwill also learn about the use of deep\nbrain stimulation and other approaches\nfor the treatment of movement disorders\nsuch as essential tremor Parkinson's\ndisease and various types of dystonias\nwhich are challenges in generating\nparticular types of movement so whether\nor not you or somebody that you know\nsuffers from an eating disorder from\nobsessive-compulsive disorder or from a\nmovement disorder today's episode is\nsure to teach you not only about what's\nhappening in those Arenas but also in\nthe Arenas of Neuroscience generally in\nfact I would say today's episode is\nespecially important for anyone that\nwants to understand how the brain works\nand what the future of brain\nmodification really looks like for all\nof us before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Roca Roca\nmakes eyeglasses and sunglasses they're\nof the absolute highest quality the\ncompany was founded by two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford and everything\nabout Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere created with performance in mind\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology the visual system and I can tell\nyou that your visual system has to\ncontend with a number of very important\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly for instance when you go\nfrom a sunny area to a more shaded area\nand then back out again it's a very\ncomplex process Roca eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were built that is engineered\nwith that sort of biology in mind and as\na consequence no matter where you are\nwearing them and where you happen to be\nyou always see through them with Crystal\nClarity the aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses\nand sunglasses is also worth mentioning\nunlike a lot of performance eyeglasses\nout there which only come in the kind of\ncyborg variety\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in\nthose varieties but they also come in\nvarieties that you would feel very\ncomfortable wearing out to dinner or to\nwork or to school really anywhere that\nyou go if you'd like to try Roca\neyeglasses you can go to Roka that's\nroka.com and enter the code huberman to\nsave 20 off on your first order again\nthat's Roca

many times before on this podcast\nabout the close relationship between\ntemperature and your ability to stay\nasleep and emerge from sleep the way Aid\nSleep mattress covers work is that they\nallow you to program the temperature of\nyour mattress so that you can fall\nasleep quickly get into deep sleep stay\nin deep sleep and emerge from that sleep\nfeeling especially rested by dropping\nthe temperature of that Surface by one\nto three degrees at the beginning of the\nnight dropping it a little bit further\ninto the night and then raising the\ntemperature towards morning because\nwaking up requires that one to three\ndegree re- increase in body temperature\nI've been sleeping on an eight-sleep\nmattress cover for the last six months\nor so now and I can assert that it is\nthe absolute biggest Game Changer in the\nquality and duration of my sleep in fact\nI don't really like traveling as much as\nI used to because the eight sleep\ndoesn't go with me and they don't seem\nto have them yet in airbnbs and hotels\nso this is also a call to action airbnbs\nand hotels please put eight sleep\nmattresses on your beds and I'll be more\napt to stay in those hotels and airbnbs\nwith that said if you'd like to try an\neight-sleep mattress cover you can go to\neightsleep.com huberman check out the\nPod 3 cover to save 150 at checkout\nagain that's eightsleep.com

also brought\nTo Us by inside tracker inside tracker\nis a personalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and\nDNA to help you better understand your\nbody and help you reach your health\ngoals now I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the\nsimple reason that many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be assessed with a\nquality blood test one of the major\nissues with the various blood tests out\nthere is that you get information back\nabout lipids and hormones and metabolic\nfactors Etc but you don't know what to\ndo with that information with inside\ntracker they make knowing what to do\nwith the information you get about your\nbiological health extremely easy they\nhave this very easy to use dashboard and\nthat dashboard tells you for instance\nwhat to change in your nutrition what\nsupplements you may want or may not want\nto take as well as other behavioral and\nother types of interventions that can\nallow you to move those numbers related\nto metabolic hormone and other factors\ninto the precise range that's optimal\nfor your immediate and long-term Health\nif you'd like

Lab podcast we talk about\nsupplements while supplements aren't\nnecessary for everyone buddy many people\nderive tremendous benefit from them\nthings like enhancing sleep and the\ndepth of sleep or for enhancing focus\nand cognitive ability or for enhancing\nenergy or adjusting hormone levels to\nOptimal range for you the huberman Lab\npodcast is now partnered with momentous\nsupplements we partner with momentous\nfor a number of important reasons first\nof all the quality of their ingredients\nis exceptional it's really Second To\nNone second of all they ship\ninternationally and that was important\nto us because a number of you reside\noutside of the United States third we've\nworked with momentous very closely to\ndevelop single ingredient formulations\nnow this turns out to be very important\nbecause if you're going to take\nsupplements\nyou want to know what's working for you\nand what isn't and of course you want to\noptimize the cost efficiency and the\nbiological efficiency of those\nsupplements to find the supplements we\ndiscussed on the huberman Lab podcast\nyou can go to live momentous spelled ous\nlive momentous.com huberman and I should\njust mention that the library of those\nsupplements is constantly expanding\nagain that's livemomentis.com huberman\nand now for my discussion with Dr Casey\nHalpern Casey I should say Dr Halpern\nlistening welcome thank you great to be\nhere yeah it's been a long time coming\nwe were colleagues at Stanford and then\nrecently you moved of course to\nUniversity of Pennsylvania also an\nincredible institution we're sorry to\nlose you so it was better sweet for me\ntoo Stanford's loss is upenn's gain but\num let's talk about your work uh past\nand present\nas I've told the listeners already\nyou're a neurosurgeon which I consider\nthe astronauts of Neuroscience because\nyou're in somewhat Uncharted Territory\nor very Uncharted Territory and yet\nPrecision is everything right the\nmargins of error are very very small so\nfor those that aren't familiar with the\ndifferences between neurosurgery\nneurology Psychiatry you just educate us\na bit what does a neurosurgeon do and\nwhat does\nfact that you're a nurse surgeon do for\nyour view of the brain how do you think\nabout and conceptualize the brain\nyeah the scope of neurosurgery is quite\nbroad uh when I was in medical school I\nI was drawn to neurosurgery because of a\nprocedure known as deep brain\nstimulation when I was at Penn as a\ncollege student I actually watched my\nfirst deep brain stimulation surgery\nperformed by Gordon boltuck who to date\nis one of my career mentors\ndeep brain stimulation is a one surgery\nthat neurosurgeons offer but it's\nactually sort of\na very small minority of what\nneurosurgery does\nyou know we take out brain tumors we\nclip aneurysms in the brain\nwe take care of patients that have had\ntraumatic brain injury concussion spine\nsurgeries ninety percent of what\nneurosurgeons do around the country uh\nyou know taking care of herniated discs\nand lumbar fusions so you know the scope\nis\nthe entire central nervous system\ninclude including the peripheral nervous\nsystem we take care of patients with\ncarpal tunnel syndrome and nerve\ndisorders\nnow over the course of the past two\ndecades or so there's been a a mission\nin the field to to sub-specialize and so\nhistorically neurosurgeons did\neverything in that domain but now we\nsub-specialize and I'm lucky to be at\nPenn Medicine where we can focus on one\nof these areas so I'm chief of\nstereotactic functional Neurosurgery\nall I do is deep brain stimulation\nsurgery and a compliment to that is\nfocus ultrasound or transcranial Focus\nultrasound which is a non-invasive way\nto do an ablation in the brain recently\nFDA approved and it's FDA approved for\nTrevor at the moment uh these two\nprocedures are for me my every day but\nuh still the minority of what\nneurosurgeons have to offer the majority\nof neurosurgery in my mind is is a bit\nmore structural than it is\nphysiology or\ndeeply rooted in how the brain functions\nwhen we take out a brain tumor we have\nto find a a safe trajectory to get to\nthe brain tumor and then we remove it\nand we help the patient recover in the\nICU similar to a brain aneurysm often we\ndon't have to go into the brain to clip\na brain aneurysm but we go around the\nbrain or under the brain to get there\nand in my mind those surgeries are a bit\nmore structural\ndeep brain stimulation the surgery that\nI do routinely is a procedure where yes\nthere is structure involved of course we\nhave to place a a very thin wire that's\ninsulated deep into a part of the brain\nthat's involved in Parkinson's disease\nfor example uh\nbut that's actually not the therapy the\ntherapy is delivering electrical\nstimulation through the tip of that wire\nor one of the tips as there actually are\nmultiple contacts at the bottom of the\nwire they're very small\nuh\nbut that's all done out of the operating\nroom you know this stimulation wire is\nconnected to a a battery pack or a pulse\ngenerator that's kind of like a\npacemaker and so we deliver this therapy\nand I always tell patients it's a bit\nmore like I have to implant a uh a tool\nto deliver you a medication but that\nmedication is going to be in the form of\nelectricity and it's going to be\ndelivered into a very small region of\nthe brain and it's that procedure that's\ninspired me to not just become a\nneurosurgeon but has really defined the\nfocus of my research laboratory as well\nMaybe by way of antidote you could tell\nus one of the more outrageous or\nsurprising or who knows um delightful\nand thrilling things about the brain\nthat you've observed as a consequence of\nstimulating different brain areas you\nknow in textbooks we always hear about\nuh the kind of dark stuff you know\nstimulate one brain area somebody goes\ninto a rage stimulate another brain area\na person starts laughing uncontrollably\nfirst of all\num given that some of the information\nlet's hope not much but some of the\ninformation in textbooks is incorrect is\nare those sorts of statements true can\none observe those in the clinic and what\nare some of the more interesting uh and\nI don't necessarily mean entertaining\nbut\num surprising things that you've seen\nwhen you've poked around in the brain\ndeliberately of course and uh\nwhat have you seen what have you heard\nI have to say I I am amazed by these\neffects uh every day yeah I'm very\nprivileged to be able to interact with\nthe human brain in this way it's always\nin them with the goal of trying to\nprovide somebody with a meaningful\ntherapy but when we deliver electrical\nstimulation\nyou know the these electrodes while they\nmight be sitting in a very small region\nof the brain there are regions\nwithin a few millimeters of where these\nelectrodes are that if stimulated could\ncause a temporary very brief side effect\na moment of laughter like you said or a\nmoment of panic and of course we can\njust shut that electrode off but often\nthese side effects could be therapeutic\nand actually that's how we have\ndiscovered ways to use deep brain\nstimulation not just for movement\ndisorders like Parkinson's disease but\nfor example patients with Parkinson's\ndisease that have a psychiatric uh uh\ncomorbidity like depression or\nobsessive-compulsive disorder a lot of\nthese patients are highly compulsive and\nimpulsive\nsometimes these problems actually melt\naway and we're trying to help their\nTremor but the patients also tell us\nthat their gambling issue has gotten\nbetter or their mood has improved and\nwhy is that well you know there's\nprobably more than one reason you know\nyou can help somebody's Mood by making\ntheir Tremor go away of course but we\nsee laughter in the clinic sometimes and\nand why is that and that's because we're\nstimulating parts of the brain that are\nnot just involved in these motor\ncircuits but they're also involved in\nwhat we call a limbic circuit or part of\nthe brain involved in emotion and if we\nlearn how to modulate those areas\ntherapeutically step by step we can\nactually develop these therapies for\nother indications like depression I\nwould say the most impressive and\nconsistent effect we have when we have a\npatient with Tremor who has been\ntremming for the past 20 years if we can\ndeliver stimulation through that\nelectrode in the clinic we have\nimmediate relief of Tremor and that is\nthe effect that inspired me to be a\nneurosurgeon when I was in college I've\nnever really wanted to do anything else\nX accept help develop that type of\ntherapeutic for another another kind of\nsymptom I'm very interested in obesity\nand related Eating Disorders compulsive\nBehavior the urge to uh to to have\nsomething that might be delicious but\ndangerous or unhealthy or a drug or a\ncompulsion like we see in OCD or pests\nof compulsive disorder uh interestingly\nlike we see Tremor melt away when we\ndeliver electricity to a certain part of\nthe brain we can see these psychiatric\nmore psychiatric problems they're not\nall psychiatric disorders but let's say\ndisorders of the brain we can see\nsymptoms of those disorders also improve\nand often immediately just like we do\nwith Tremor so I see it all the time to\nto pick out one uh would be would be a\nchallenge because for me this is my my\neveryday\nthe speed of the relief that you\ndescribed for Tremor is really\num incredible just thinking about drug\ntherapies and there too there are side\neffects but they're still a lot of\nmysteries as to for instance why ssris\neven work when they work\nand the timing is always\na challenge timing dosage yes absolutely\num I'd love to learn more from you about\nOCD I I have several reasons for asking\nthis first of all I'm a somewhat\nobsessive person I tend to be very very\nnarrowly focused although I confess it's\nnot a step function it takes me some\ntime to turn off the chatter but once\nI'm into a thought train or a mode of\nbeing uh and thinking and work it's very\nhard for me to exit that that mode it's\nlike a deep Trench\nadaptive in some circumstances less\nadaptive than others as you know the\nother is that when I was a kid uh I had\na little bit of a grunting tick I used\nto I had a this intense intense desire\nto clear my throat\num to the point where my my dad said\nlike you need to stop that he used to\nsqueeze my hand every time I do it and I\nused to hide in the back seat of the car\nin the closet to do it because it\nprovided so much relief and then it\neventually passed yes I wasn't medicated\nthey never did anything about it every\nonce in a while now if I'm very fatigued\nif I've been working a lot I notice it\nstarts to come back I'll do this like\nkind of grunting and so it's been sort\nof like a pet neurological symptom for\nme that reminds me that these these\ncircuits exist in all of us and that\nsometimes they go haywire and sometimes\nthey just have subtle um you know over\nexcitation or something of that sort and\nthen the third reason is that I get\nthousands of questions about OCD could\nyou perhaps just tell us what is OCD\nsure um what are some brain areas\ninvolved what are the current range of\ntreatments and\nwhat's the difference between someone\nwho is obsessive and somebody who has\ntrue OCD\nso a brief disclosure as a neurosurgeon\nI do take care of patients with severe\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\num but my perspective on OCD may be a\nlittle bit different than a psychiatrist\nwho who lives and breathes OCD and sees\npatients every single day with OCD I'd\nprobably take care of a three to five\npatients a year with deep brain\nstimulation for obsessive-compulsive\ndisorders so I don't see these patients\nas routinely but my laboratory is geared\nas a researcher I'm very focused on\ntrying to improve outcomes of deep brain\nstimulation for for OCD so I do feel I\nhave expertise and and a perspective to\nshare but just a brief disclosure I\nI do feel that as a neurosurgeon I am\nobligated to better understand where the\nobsessions in the brain come from and\nhow we can interrupt them to stop the\ncompulsion that's associated with the\nobsession\nsort of the intrinsic\nmost feature of OCD uh better than we're\nactually doing it for example if we were\nto offer a patient with Tremor deep\nbrain stimulation surgery of course\nthere's some risk to the procedure but\nthe outcome is so consistent and\npositive that many patients are willing\nto take on that risk\nuh for obsessive compulsion compulsive\ndisorder the\nsurgery risk is about the same however\nthe benefit is not quite as robust\nand so a lot of patients and they're\nreferring psychiatrists are reluctant to\nrefer these patients to us and it's\ncompletely understandable uh I've been\nleading an Endeavor with a number of\ncollaborators around the country to try\nto\nbetter understand these circuits in the\nbrain uh study them in humans both\ninvasively and non-invasively that would\nbe with an electrode-based surgery sort\nof like we do at epilepsy to understand\nwhere seizures come from we want to\nunderstand better where obsessions come\nfrom but we're also working with imaging\nexperts and geneticists to understand\nOCD at a broader level as well\nuh I I consider OCD to be a a spectrum\ndisorder in a way uh and I I apologize\nto those who who might feel that I'm\nusing that term incorrectly I'm using it\nin a way to describe\npatients that have obsessions and even\nsome related compulsions might not meet\ncriteria for OCD it may be something\nAndrew that that you have and as a\nneurosurgeon I'm really obsessive about\nsafety and compulsive about my surgical\nprocedures so you know I I think that\nsome aspect of OCD which we often joke\nabout but we should you know consider\nseriously because people do suffer from\nthis uh some aspect of it helps us there\nare you know famous uh CEOs that\nprobably have some level of OCD uh\nsurgeons and scientists alike so perhaps\nif it can be controlled it's an asset\nand uh but if it goes awry and is\nuncontrollable then it becomes\nobsessive-compulsive disorder and I tend\nto see the patients that are the most\nsevere so they have failed medication\nand there are multiple medications that\nare worth trying for OCD some can\nactually be very helpful which\nneurotransmitter systems do they tend to\npoke at well ssris are sort of the the\nfirst line for OCD but also tricyclics\ncan be helpful so this is still the\nserotonin system but as we know the\nserotonin system interacts with the you\nknow neurogenergic system and the\ndopamine system so it's hard to\nbe specific to one of these things and I\nthink that's also why it's hard for us\nto predict how these medications are\ngoing to to work for these kinds of\npatients but tricyclics and ssris can be\nvery helpful and are definitely first\nline and there's others exposure\nresponse prevention is uh probably the\nmost effective option which is kind of\nlike cognitive behavioral therapy but\nthese are different and offered by\npsychologists and this is a whole field\nand there's a a field or I should say a\nwhole clinic at my institution\nfocused it was started by Edna foa\nat Penn who\nthis is what they do for these patients\nuh is offer these types of cognitive\ntherapies exposure to the stressor and\nto try to get patients to habituate to\nwhatever it is that stresses them and\ncauses these uh compulsions to help\nthese patients live in every day and\nfunction these are all fabulously\nhelpful therapies for a variety of\npatients but there's still about 30 of\npatients that still suffer from OCD and\nsome of them have severe OCD sometimes\nit's moderate to severe and those are\nthe patients that I'm really motivated\nto try to help\num our therapies for those patients\nright now I would say are are worth\npursuing but not optimal\num and so it's it's one of those things\nthat we have to balance as a researcher\nbecause when you see patients like this\nyou want to do everything you can to\nhelp them and I think it's important to\neducate patients on the risks and\nbenefits of them this is deep brain\nstimulation surgery but also capsulotomy\nwhich is more of an ablation approach a\nlittle bit like deep brain stimulation\nbut rather than delivering stimulation\nthrough an electrode you can actually\nheat the tissue and even destroy it some\nwould say this part of the brain is very\nsafe to destroy it's kind of like an\nappendix\num others would say it's safer to\nmodulate I have seen patients do very\nwell with these ablations and so you\nknow you asked me earlier what what I\nfind so amazing about the brain these\neffects that we can have sometimes the\nlack of effect is what's so amazing you\ncan actually\nTraverse parts of the brain without\nhaving any adverse effects on patients\nfunction at least that you can test but\nyou can also destroy small parts of the\nbrain we're talking three or four\nmillimeters in size these little\nablations can be really helpful for\npatients but have no obvious side\neffects that we can tell perhaps after a\nshort recovery from surgery but\nnonetheless despite how safe they might\nbe these surgical procedures still are\nsurgical procedures and patients are\nhesitant to perceived especially when\nthey know that their chance of a\ntransformative effect is quite low we\ncan generally\nachieve a responder rate of about 50\npercent and responders still have\nsymptomatic OCD so I'm really uh sort of\ninspired to really find a way to deliver\nthese therapies in a more disease\nspecific or symptom-specific way but\nwe're years away probably from from that\ntherapy since it's all part of a\nresearch study at the moment\nwhat brain areas should I think about\nwhen I think about OCD years ago I\nremember opening a textbook I think it\nwas an undergraduate still and work from\nJudith Rappaport at the National\nInstitutes of mental health this would\nbe late 80s early 90s was\num had done some neuroimaging or maybe\nit was pet\nor some other Imaging technique and had\nidentified portions of the basal ganglia\nsure caudi putanum type structures in\nOCD and maybe some differences in boys\nversus girls so what brain areas are\nthere sex differences in terms of OCD\nand were one to\ncome into your clinic this you know for\nthis sort of a work of ablations or\nstimulation uh where would you first\nstart to probe in the brain yeah you\nthis is a uh\na disorder of both cortex and the Sub\nsub cortex uh\nthe cortical control areas areas that\nare involved in inhibitory control we\nhave found to not function properly in\npatients with OCD so areas like the\norbital frontal cortex and the\nprefrontal cortex if you image these\nareas or study them even in a a rodent\nmodel of OCD which quite honestly these\nmodels they model aspects of OCD but OCD\nis a human condition you can't really\nmodel this whole condition in a in a\nmouse or a wrap but perhaps you can\nmodel compulsive behavior in a rat sure\nand pulling out their hair yeah exactly\nyou know that's that's not necessarily\nobsessive compulsive disorder but that\nis compulsive behavior and perhaps if\nyou can ameliorate that in a rat that\nmight be helpful for a patient with OCD\nbut we have to approach animal modeling\nof OCD thoughtfully uh and and most\nscientists do I think uh when we study\nOCD in in models or in in humans with\nimaging and and we're trying to do it\ninvasively with with electrodes like we\ndo in epilepsy patients\nwe find that areas in the cortex like\nthe prefrontal and orbital frontal\ncortex are are not functioning they will\nthe way they would in a non-oc patient\nthey are often hyper functioning uh such\nthat while you might say Well they're\nhyper functioning so aren't these\npatients you know functioning better\nthat hyper focused yeah hyper focused\nexactly\num no I I would say it's it's not so\nmuch an up or down it's more that\nthey're just dysfunctional and we need\nto find a way to try to restore normal\nfunction to these areas it's not so much\ndirectional really\num we tend to oversimplify brain\nfunction by thinking about it with\ndirectionality too much\num unfortunately Imaging studies\nsometimes demonstrate activation or\nhypoactivation and that's where I think\nthese kinds of things can be\nmisconstrued but what I would call the\ncortical areas of OCD is that they're\ndysregulated and we need to find a way\nto try to normalize their function so uh\nthe frontal lobe is is huge but areas of\nthe frontal lobe that are a bit more\nbasal like the ofc or orbital frontal\ncortex and the prefrontal cortex\ndefinitely consistently seem to be\nimplicated in patients with OCD and then\ntheir projections to the subcortex this\nis the basal ganglia like you were\nsaying caudi putamen or the dorsal\nstriatum and these are interconnected\nwith the ventral striatum this is an\narea of the brain that I uh focus a lot\nof my energy in um this is the\nventralstratum which is not limited to\nbut includes the nucleus accumbens this\nis an area of the brain that we know to\nbe involved in gating reward seeking\nbehavior when it's perturbed it seems to\ngait compulsive Behavior meaning a rat\nwill pursue a reward despite punishment\ndespite a foot shock for example and\nthat can be uh similar to an OCD patient\nthey will\num check their home for safety until 3\nA.M in the morning and not sleep that\nnight in a way that is similar to a rat\nseeking out a food reward uh despite a\nfoot shock\num doing something because of the urge\nbut despite the risk and perhaps there\nis some normal\njudgment there we all have to take risks\nto function in everyday Society to be\nsuccessful we have to take a risk\nto take care of patients with surgery\nthere's some risk there we make a\njudgment call and that's not a condition\nthat that's just normal but when our\njudgment is consistently sort of puts us\nat risk that's where we have something\nlike OCD but OCD is also you know it's\none of many conditions that suffer from\nthese kinds of problems we tend to label\nthem because they tend to present in a\nconsistent way so we have patients with\nOCD that have hyper checking Behavior or\ncontamination Behavior where they if\nthey feel contaminated they'll wash\ntheir hands for hours repeatedly or if\nthey drop their toothbrush on the floor\nthis will lead to a compulsive behavior\nof cleaning a toothbrush or brushing\nyour teeth consistently very very common\nsymptoms that we see or signs that the\npatients report to us or or that we\nobserve\nbut you know patients with eating\ndisorders they tend to if if they have\nbinging disorder they'll overeat if they\nhave bulimia they might Purge despite\nthe risk of these things and so um\naddiction is is similar we we tend to\ndrug seek if we're addicted\num uh we'll we'll pay off a dealer uh in\norder to get our fix and despite the\nrisk and and that type of urge despite\nthe risk is something that I I've always\nbeen really interested in and it's a\ncommon denominator to all of these\nproblems and if you think about these\nproblems I mean these are some of the\nmost common conditions in our society\ntoday I'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be in the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 I\nreally appreciate that you're building\nthis bridge from OCD to nucleus\naccumbens which is of course associated\nwith reward in various forms and we'll\nget to that\num I'll share a personal anecdote as a\nas a form of question when I was in\ncollege and studying a lot I relied on\ncaffeine as a stimulant I've never\nreally been into drugs or alcohol I've\nbeen Lucky in that sense I don't drink\nand I care less if alcohol disappeared\nnever really liked recreational drugs so\nI was never drawn to them\nhowever when I was in college at the\ntime there were these little epinephrine\npills that were common in a lot of\nsports supplements these are like\npre-workout type things yes not unlike\nenergy drinks now which I completely\navoid\num and I had this experience of taking\none of these and drinking some coffee\nand of course it gave me a lift in\nenergy these are very similar to\namphetamine they were legal over the\ncounter at the time they're now either\nbanned or illegal I do not recommend\nthem and I had a lot of energy but what\nI noticed is that my grunting tick came\nback and I had I made one mistake I\nstill think of this as one mistake which\nwas\num I engage in a superstitious Behavior\nI knocked on wood and then somehow it\nfelt very rewarding like it gave me some\ntotally irrational but internally\nrational sense of of security around I\nforget what I was knocking on wood about\nand I found that I couldn't break that\nknock on wood compulsion I felt I needed\nto knock on wood and so then I started\nsneaking knock on Woods like in mid-exam\nand studying and pretty soon I was\nknocking on wood often I developed a\nsuperstition\nand so I'm curious about the role of\nsuperstition and compulsion in the\ncrossover there it makes sense logically\nto me but I was equally shocked to learn\nthat when I stopped taking this\nstimulant which I was quite happy to to\nstop because it did make me feel too\nalert couldn't sleep well Etc\nthat the Superstition went away as well\nand I'm guessing this has something to\ndo with some of the reward circuitry as\nit's called related to stimulants\nagain\nI am not encouraging anyone to take\nstimulants although healthy use of\ncaffeine or safe use of caffeine might\nbe the one universally accepted\nstimulant\num it was really surprising to me how\nquickly this came on how quickly it\nengaged my my thinking and my behavior\nthe obsessions and the compulsions and\nhow quickly it turned off when I stopped\ntaking this Sports stimulant or whatever\nit was I don't even remember I think it\nwas some form of epinephrine ephedrine\nsure some saw epinephrine excuse me I\nmisspoke ephedrine\num\nis what I described sound totally\noutside the bounds of of uh logic or or\nam I imagining at all um no it did\nhappen I'm certain it happened yeah no I\ndon't think you're imagining it at all I\nyou know this the grunting that you you\nmentioned to me you know first of all I\ndidn't uh comment but you know that that\nsort of not to put a label on it but it\nsounds like a tick and you know ticks in\nin young males extremely common and they\ndo tend to go away linking to like since\nI have a good friend who actually a\nfamous neuroscientist I won't mention\nwho it is who's worked very hard to\nsuppress his his blinking tits and when\nhe gets fatigued it comes back and and\num he's very high functioning yes in his\npersonal life and his professional life\nbut but when you're talking to him and\nhe starts doing this so you kind of\nstart wondering like what's going on\nyeah yeah and it's unfortunate you know\npeople with these problems especially as\nthey get more severe then you get\nTourette Syndrome you know it's hard to\nfunction in our society I have some\nfriends that have Tourette I'll tell you\nI I'm just so inspired because there\nthere so\num they're so confident and you know\npeople obviously notice these problems\nbut they they just live their life and\nthey're very successful and that's not\ntypical\num I have I have friends that I went to\nPenn with undergrad that had these kinds\nof problems and I was always just so\nhappy and inspired by them but what's\nmore typical is uh you know these\nproblems cause people to\nlose their confidence and and not you\nknow uh pursue you know their profession\nas they may have done or\num things of that nature so I I think\nit's all related to the fact that we our\nbrains are very vulnerable and to get\nback to your question about the\nstimulant you know I think I think your\nbrain was very vulnerable to it you know\nyou you sort of may have had a\npredisposition to it\num you mentioned that you have you're a\nlittle obsessive and with the tick there\nmaybe you have this kind of you know on\nthe on the mild side of the spectrum OCD\num and I I probably do as well by the\nway so I also also have avoided drugs\nfor that reason uh in my life I'll drink\na little bit of wine here and there but\nthat's about it\num and uh but I I think most people\ndon't avoid these things and we see\nthese problems in relation to not just\ntaking a stimulant but any kind of\nenvironmental exposure our own Society\ncauses so much stress\num and that's why I think we have these\nhuman conditions these are human\nconditions we try to model them in in\nanimals but most animals don't have\nthese kinds of problems you know I've\nheard that you can a an animal like a a\nmonkey in the wild can have depression a\nmonkey's version of depression but I\ndon't think it's really typical or human\ndepression you know and certainly it's\nnot as prevalent as depression is in our\nhuman society I think you know we\nhaven't evolved to manage the stresses\nthat are in this society that we\ncurrently have and stimulants is\nprobably one of them you know and I I\nsuspect you are probably a little bit\nvulnerable\num it's possible the stimulant led to an\noverdrive of your prefrontal and orbital\nfrontal cortex and even brought out a\nlittle OCD Behavior related to this\nsuper uh this Superstition that you had\nso um no I believe that entirely and I\nalso think you know that's why things\nlike OCD and other kinds of psychiatric\ndisorders tend to present themselves in\ncollege when people leave their home and\nthey're in school and they're stressed\nand they're getting exposed to things\nthat they haven't been exposed to before\noutside of the home and and you know\ntheir brains aren't evolved and\nsophisticated enough yet to help them\ncope with these kinds of stresses and\nhow it manifests is in these kinds of\nconditions and it's I don't want to put\na label on those conditions but\ncertainly could be a psychiatric\ndisorder but could also just be lots of\nanxiety it could also be the kind of\nproblems that you had as well so um and\nI think the nucleus accumbens and the\ncortical areas that we've been\ndiscussing that that sort of send\nprojections to these areas are are\nprobably at least one of the main\ncircuits involved in these kinds of\nthings\nI'm relieved it's no longer present but\nI confess it oh I always feel it close\nby a long run helps so move you know\nbeing a slightly fatigued not overly\nfatigued but slightly fatigued seems to\nmove out the the kind of physical\ncompulsion but try to channel it um\nnever taken any medication for it then\nhere I am so I'm still still going I may\ncall you for a referral at some point\nbut sure at this point I'm uh I'm\nfeeling okay\num let's talk about nucleus accumbens\nand reward circuitry and the\nrelationship between OCD reward\naddiction uh and to just give you a\nsense of where I'm headed with this is\ninto the realm of a food related and\neating related uh\nbehaviors and disorders because I know\nyou're doing some very important work\nthere what is nucleus accumbens I know\nwe all have one or two\num one on each side of the brain what is\nit what roles does it play\num in healthy brain behavior and in\npathology\nyeah the nucleus accumbens is a part of\nthe brain part of our reward circuits\nThe Hub of the reward circuits that I've\nalways been most fascinated in\num\nthere are scientists around the world\nsome of the leading arguably some of the\nleading scientists in the world the\nfather of addiction Neuroscience I call\nhim\num although he tells me I'm nuts Rob\nmalenka who has studied the nucleus\naccumbens since the beginning of his\ncareer and who I worked with when I was\nat Stanford\num fabulous scientist and Mentor taught\nme so much\num taught the world so much incredible\nperson scientist and phys and Physicians\nyes MD PhD and uh brilliant in both ways\nand um very\nfatherly in a lot of way in terms of\nteaching people how to how to do science\nand and be good citizens as well\num\nbut uh\nthe nucleus accumbens is an area that is\nalso very complicated because it has a\nlot of functions uh\nit it interconnects with many parts of\nthe brain\num\nbut there are some things about the\nnucleus accumbens that are very\nconsistent uh\nso when I started getting interested in\nreward and what a what I could do as a\nsurgeon to try to improve how we manage\nRewards and what I mean by that\nspecifically is if you have an urge for\na reward\nthat that's a normal phenomenon that's\nnot something we're trying to stop the\nissue is if you have an urge for a\nreward that either puts you or somebody\nelse at risk it's probably a reward we\nshouldn't have I suppose you could say\nwell it depends on the size of the\nreward and the size of the risk and how\nthat fits into your societal Norms\num but for example if you're obese and\nyou have a doctor who is advising that\nyou lose weight and try to control your\neating habits uh you know perhaps better\nfood choices is an important way for you\nto be healthier and and not pursuing\nthose better food choices that's an urge\nthat we probably need to treat\nuh if you're a drug addict and you use\nheroin or opiate considering the opiate\ncrisis right now or cocaine\nwhich is untreatable at the moment uh\nyou know that that cocaine might make\nyou feel\nlike you have some more energy that day\nto deal with your work or that opiate\nmight make you feel better because life\nis stressful but the risk of doing those\nthings is really high in fact\npotentially lethal uh so that's an urge\nthat's treatable if you have OCD and you\ncan't sleep at night because you're so\nnervous that you didn't lock the door\nand you've checked 30 times\nthat's a reality for some people with\nsevere OCD\num that's an urge we got to treat\neating disorder is the same eating\neating disorders and obesity are\nobviously linked because of the\nrelationship of a patient with food but\nthey're also quite distinct not\neverybody with obesity has an eating\ndisorder and obviously not everybody\nwith an eating disorder has obesity I'm\nparticularly interested in patients that\nhave binge eating disorder as well as\nobesity because they're so heavily\nlinked\nbut not everybody with binging disorder\nhas obesity but on average most are\noverweight\num we are doing a deep brain stimulation\ntrial at Penn where we're trying to\nmodulate the nucleus accumbens and\nunderstand it better in patients that\nhave failed gastric bypass surgery the\nmost aggressive form of treatment for\nobesity and we and we believe they\nfailed gastric bypass surgery because of\nbinge eating disorder meaning they just\ncan't control how much they eat so their\nobesity is either related or even due to\novereating not some predisposition to\num that body habitus you know obesity is\na phenotype something that we can see\nnot everybody is obese because of the\nsame thing so it's very important I was\ntaught this by a close mentor and friend\nTom wadden when he was the director of\nthe Obesity Center at Penn or the center\nfor weight eating disorders\nand and he said to me you know Casey uh\nyou know be careful with obesity you're\ninterested in addiction and I understand\nyou're interested in the addictive\nTendencies of certain patients with\nobesity uh\nuh and and their relationship with food\nbut not everybody with obesity has that\nproblem and and in fact it's it's\nprobably present about 20 of patients\nwith obesity\nbut now taking a step back twenty\npercent of patients with obesity is\nstill a massive problem of epidemic\nproportions and perhaps some of these\npatients have either some form of\nbinging disorder or or I should say some\ndegree of bingeing disorder uh or at\nleast loss of control eating which is\ncommon to both\num so that's a feature that I think\neating disorder experts obesity experts\nneurosurgeons\nobesity\nobesity medicine experts would agree is\ncommon to eating disorders and obesity\nand I also believe would is common to\naddicts and perhaps patients with OCD is\nsort of a loss of control disorder\num it's actually not a disorder known by\nlike the DSM-5 some diagnostic manual\nbut a feature I should say of these\nconditions that's common and that common\ndenominator I believe can be\nrestored or at least this problem can be\nameliorated or improved upon by a better\nunderstanding and a tailored treatment\nto the nucleus accumbens specifically\nwe've learned in mice that if you expose\na mouse now this is just a model if you\nexpose a mouse to high fat food not food\nthat they would normally eat food that\nis like 60 fat high fat it's like butter\num\nwe've learned that if you expose them to\nfood like that within two weeks their\nnucleus accumbens is not functioning\nlike a mouse that was never exposed to\nthat high fat food there's aspects of it\nthat are hyperactive I could say and\nthere's aspects of it that are\nhypoactive or decreased activity but\neither way it's it's not functioning\nproperly and most likely that function\nis predisposing continued behavior and\nthen probably eventually leads to things\nlike a habit that gets developed and\nthat's a whole nother area of these\nkinds of problems that is very\ncomplicated and poorly understood but in\nany case if we just focus on the\nbehavior at hand\nit seems that repeated exposure to\nsomething like high fat food\na drug of abuse or any type of reward\nthat is a really strong reward in a way\nit can hijack normal functioning of the\nnucleus accumbens so the goal of our\ninvasive trial is to try to restore\nnormal functioning to that nucleus\naccumbens uh in mice there seems to be a\nsignal that predicts when they're going\nto lose control and we can use that\nsignal to deliver a sort of a real-time\ntherapy in the form of deep brain\nstimulation just a brief amount of\nstimulation and that actually blocks the\nbehavior\nand what's interesting is over time that\nsignal actually decreases in frequency\nwhich suggests some level of restoring\nnormal function to that circuit in the\nmouse and we're trying to do that now in\na human trial\nfascinating where is the stimulation\nprovided because I would imagine if one\nwere to stimulate nucleus accumbens you\nwould see a reinforcement\nof whatever Behavior coincided or\npreceded the stimulation so the\nstimulation it's a a brief delivery of\nstimulation anywhere between 5 and 10\nseconds\nthat is intended to just disrupt the\nperturbed signaling that's happening in\nthe nucleus accumbens\nthere are disorders like\ndepression let's say that I I would\ndescribe as a bit more of a state\ndisorder and this is obviously\noversimplified because we know that\nthere's fluctuations in mood and\ndepression as well so don't let me\noversimplify it too much\num but\num but but for now let's forgive the\noversimplification if we if we accept\nthat depression is a state disorder or\nmaybe Parkinson's disease is a state\ndisorder recognizing that they do\nfluctuate\nuh these types of problems most likely\nnot but not definitely most likely need\na continuous therapy of some form a\ntherapy that's consistent uh perhaps a\ntherapy that fluctuates with the\ncondition but nevertheless still\nconsistent\num\nbinge eating disorder or OCD or\naddiction\num and binging disorder in the context\nof obesity a lot of these patients are\nfunctioning quite normally every single\nday it's just that intermittently\nthroughout the day there's brief\ninterruptions in their normal functions\nsuch that they have thoughts about food\nor the drug of abuse that they're really\nlonging to have\nand so we want to deliver a episodic\ntherapy delivered\nat the right time and only at the right\ntime\nto try to interrupt the\ncircuit aberration or the the problem at\nhand that is going to lead to that\ndangerous behavior and to kind of get\nthe patient back on track to what\nthey're doing\num\nI don't necessarily think that it leads\nto a reinforcement it's possible we have\nto study that more but rather the goal\nis to just disrupt perhaps what is kind\nof Habitual\num or or at least this kind of recurring\nproblem that is happening you know\npeople that have bingeing disorder at\nleast at a severe level they tend to\n about once a day\nbut they don't binge all day long of\ncourse they have a moment perhaps when\nthey get home from work and they're\nstressed where they might\nhave a bout of binge what constitutes a\nbinge and I also want to know does binge\neating disorder come on suddenly meaning\nas an entire disorder one day\npeople wake up Suddenly they have\nbinging disorder or is this you know a\nfew too many buffets and I'm being\nentirely serious here you know kind of\nunlimited food and a circuit gets\nflipped or kind of starts moving into\nthe high RPMs so to speak\num so how does it come on and um I mean\nI'm actually surprised to hear that it's\nonce a day I would think just hearing\nbinging disorder I assume it's like OCD\nwhich it probably fluctuates across the\nday as well but I would have thought\nanytime people around food they just\nsimply can't control their intake of\nfood yes so so what does this look like\nin terms of the onset of the disorder\nand then what do you think underlies\nthis once a day type of phenomena that's\npretty interesting yeah so severe\nbinging disorder these patients will\nbinge about once a day it could be a\ncouple times a day but in general it's\nnot more than that moderate is about\nthree to four times a week for example\nthe reason I think that that seems\nsurprising to you\nand\nif you think about it it is surprising\nbut but\num and I agree with you but the reason\nfor that is is actually just in the\ndefinitions of the word\nand as a neurosurgeon in full disclosure\nas I as I mentioned you know I don't see\nthese patients clinically I see them for\nresearch trial purposes and I try to\nunderstand the literature around eating\ndisorders and I obviously collaborate\nwith fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh in\nin these problems that are that are\nhighly Innovative people\nuh but the word binge is a definition\nthere's a definition to that word and\nyou can't necessarily binge all day\nbecause our stomachs are not big enough\num and so uh there's a limit to how much\none can eat and to meet criteria for a\nbinge you have to have a sense of loss\nof control\nyou have to eat an enormous amount of\nfood in a brief period of time\nand yes generally that doesn't happen\nmore than about once a day in a patient\nwith severe binge eating disorder uh\nhowever they can lose control quite\noften and in fact perhaps even at every\nmeal they might meet criteria for about\na loss of control where they yes they\nmay have lost control but they might not\nhave eaten enough\nto constitute what we would Define as a\nbinge\num and that would be a there's no\nspecific number to that by the way it's\nit's really just compared to their\nnormal meal you know perhaps it's uh 50\nof their daily calories in that one\nbrief moment\num so uh that's that's why I think it\nseems surprising that binders aren't\nhappening more often than that what I\nwould say is if we replace the term\nbinge with loss of control eating loss\nof control eating Could Happen dozens of\ntimes a week\num and in fact you know the patients\nthat we're studying you know we've we've\nseen patients that lose control 20 30\ntimes a week and that's probably the the\nterm you have in mind when you're saying\nyou're surprised that it's just one time\na day and it's specifically related to\nthe fact that these patients have to eat\nsuch a large amount of food in such a\nbrief period of time\num so it's hard to do that more than\nonce a day I see\num you mentioned that some pre-existing\nanxiety might bias somebody to have a\nbinge\nI'm also fascinated by something I've\nobserved before which was when I was in\ncollege my my girlfriend had a roommate\nwho we were aware was bulimic and would\nbinge and then Purge and often uh when\nshe ingested alcohol that would lead to\na binge sure which is kind of the\nopposite of anxiety when I think about\nalcohol as something that slightly\nreduces prefrontal activity somewhat of\na sedative or certainly a set of higher\ndosages\nso this brings to something that you\nsaid I'm just gonna I won't say it as\neloquently as you did that it seems like\nit's not neither the case that anxiety\nleads to binging nor that hypo reduced\nactivation of the forebrain and lower\nanxiety leads to binging it's this\ndysregulation of circuitry that the the\nSeesaw could go either way and it can\nthrow things off it's off balance in\nboth cases yes uh it's uh and that seems\nto be a that seems to pose a problem it\nseems like it's a particularly tricky\nproblem and kind of explains to me in my\nnon-clinical awareness why medication\nmight be really hard to use as a way to\ntreat this but that being able to poke\naround in the brain and assay in real\ntime you know how do you feel do you\nfeel like binging now or do you feel\num further from the binge impulse\nis that what you do with these patients\nare they awake while you're stimulating\nthe brain because it's one thing to say\nI stimulate a brain area and the binging\ngoes away or partial relief or complete\nrelief but how do you know are they in\nthere with a donut\num and you're tempting them so how do\nyou actually know if it's ablating a\nbrain area is going to lead to uh relief\nor exacerbation or no impact on on this\ndisorder\nyeah so uh there's a lot to unpack there\num I'll try to go one step at a time and\nif I miss something please remember no\nand I tend to ask these three-part\nquestions specifically of neurosurgeons\nbecause I like to challenge you guys\nbecause again you are the astronauts of\nNeuroscience also I'm just going to take\na moment to poke at neurosurgery because\nI have a couple close friends\num who are neurosurgeons and I consider\nCasey Randy I don't know if he considers\nme a friend but of course I am a friend\nI'm teasing there too which is first of\nall they all have incredible hands right\nthey have I'm not they all guard their\nhands with the kind of\num uh protection that you would guard\nthe the tools of the most important\ntools of your trade so they're very\ncareful with their hands you're not\ngoing to see them doing heavy deadlifts\nyou're not because of the way that\nimpacts the motor neurons it's all about\nfine control yes um so if your\nneurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts you\nmight want to consider getting a\ndifferent neurosurgery I hope I didn't\nput anyone out of work there and then\nthe other the other thing is that\num\nyou all are tend to be very calm people\nat least on the exterior we'll return to\nthis later okay\num but I do throw three or four\nquestions out at once so so elevated\nautonomic arousal and alertness as well\nas decrease autonomic arousal and\nalertness both seem to be able to lead\nto binging and then there's this\nquestion of how do you know whether or\nnot to stimulate or to ablate or whether\nor not to leave a structure alone in\nother words what does one of these\nexperiments look like in the laboratory\nyeah sort of a clinic excuse me yeah of\ncourse yeah these are questions I think\nabout all the time\num and um\nI do want to come back to the\ndeadlifting comment but I\num\nregarding and you and you referred to\nthis earlier as well and I don't know if\nI've addressed it sufficiently either is\nis sort of like what what comes first\nhere or how does this develop\num\nI I think first of all I\nI like to understand these kinds of\nproblems in in sort of the the construct\nof what I I consider to be a bit of a\ntwo-hit hypothesis\num so you sort of need like in the\nconcussion literature you need the\nsecond hit is can be devastating so if\nyou have a concussion you know you want\nto only return to play when your\nsymptoms are gone uh and cleared by a\nphysician\num\nso uh in the context of Eating Disorders\nor let's say binge eating disorder first\nof all I I didn't mention earlier but\nthis is the most common eating disorder\naffects anywhere between three and five\npercent of the population wow\num and it's probably\nunder-diagnosed in obesity by the way\nand if obesity affects 35 of our\npopulation most likely binging disorder\naffects more than three to five percent\nbut that's that's the current uh\nliterature uh estimate on on the\nprevalence\nso um how do we develop a gene disorder\nand is it related to this anxiety\nquestion\num\nyou know I think that there is a\npredisposition that's the first hit\num\nI actually think all humans have this\npredisposition just some have it more\nthan others\num I don't think that we've evolved to\nlive in a society where\nfoods are so readily available and\nenormously delicious and have so much\nsugar and fat in them not that there's\nany particular problem with either of\nthese macronutrients it's just the\nexcess of it and how they're refined uh\nthat I think is the problem\num\nyou know those high fructose corn syrup\nin almost everything we eat we it's in\nbread I don't even know why it's in\nbread sometimes it's just kind of crazy\nso so I don't I don't think we're\nevolved to live in a society\num\nthat that has food that's so readily\navailable like that\num and cheap by the way in fact the\ncheaper the foods are sort of the the\nmore refined and palatable and I would\nargue dangerous to eat I think they\nchange our reward circuits for the worse\num and put us at risk for wanting more\num\nI tend to get a headache when I eat food\nlike that and and perhaps that's uh\nevolutionary Advantage because I don't\nwant to eat those Foods because they\nactually do make me sick\num\nso um in a lot of ways I kind of wish\nthat headache on everybody because\nperhaps we wouldn't have all these\nproblems uh or at least some of them\nwould go away\nso I think that's the first issue is a\npredisposition to\nuh or a vulnerability to these types of\nfoods\num which we undoubtedly all have to a\ncertain extent but some more than others\nand then and then and that's so that's\nthe first hit\nis this predisposition in the context of\nthis sort of food focused Society\nand then the second hit is\nprobably a stressful event or a\nstressful life\num and probably a recurring stressful\nevent I'm not sure this is published\nI've never sat down with like a eating\ndisorder expert and and had this\nquestion about how this develops and I'm\nnot sure it's actually well well known\num\nbut in a lot of ways I think that that\nanswer anybody would agree with that we\nneed sort of a predisposition in the\nexposure the environmental exposure and\nthe genetic predisposition\num\nbut also a stressor and that stressor is\nprobably one that's recurring and you\nknow it's obvious in our society these\nstressors are everywhere and how we can\nmanage them is is often poor and you\nknow I think we can all relate with that\nand then there's something else in the\nbackground that I think is really\nimportant to mention is that patients\nwith these kinds of problems are\nembarrassed because our society doesn't\nthink fondly of these kinds of patients\nyou know binging disorder patients they\ndo tend to be overweight that's\nobviously a stigma obese obesity is\nanother stigma then there's the opposite\nin a way it's an opposite by the way for\na phenotype standpoint is that anorexia\nI mean that's another stigma and you\nknow gosh you know\nnot to make this about one sex over\nanother but when when girls are told\nthey're pretty because they're thin it\njust reinforces this problem and of\ncourse you want to complement people and\nmake them feel good about themselves but\nthe problem is that in this vulnerable\nsociety that that can lead to problems\nbecause people start thinking oh I\nshould be thin or thinner\num so I\nI think that it's a little bit of a\nsocietal understanding that our brains\nare very vulnerable and I think that\nwill really help changing Society is\nhard and most of society is not you know\nill meaning uh it's all done by accident\num but that is the society that we live\nin so if we can try to improve that\nstigma uh and and be kinder to people in\nthat way I think a lot of these problems\nwould get better people that are obese\nthat feel embarrassed by their obesity\nit doesn't help it only makes it worse\nbecause they give up\nsame thing might be true for anorexics\nso I really think it's important to\nconsider all of these things and that's\nwhy it's so complicated and it would be\nso hard to do a well-controlled study to\nunderstand it better because there's so\nmany of these variables to control for\nthat you really can't control for you\nmight be able to control for them in a\nmouse's home cage but not not in the\nsociety that we live in so\nso that that's kind of my brief uh sort\nof summary of how I would answer your\nfirst question then I think you know\nyour second question I I sort of take\nthat as well how do you\nstudy such a complicated problem in the\noperating room and and in the clinic\nbecause I mentioned the operating room\nbecause that's sort of the first step\nhere first we want to we have uh just to\nclarify we have a nih-funded uh trial\napproved by the FDA for for research to\ndo this first in human study\num we've treated two patients we have\nfour more to come at Penn in um\nand in this study uh it's something I've\nbeen working towards my entire career\nwhat we don't know is\nwhere in the nucleus accumbens\nwill we identify\ncells or\nregions that seem to be uh\ninvolved in this sort of reward seeking\nBehavior I would call it a peditive it's\nkind of like appetite but the word\nrepetitive is I think a a good word to\nuse what part of the nucleus Cummins is\nrepetitive is the whole thing repetitive\nprobably not it's huge in my world it's\nhuge as a neurosurgeon you know I Target\nparts of the brain that are three or\nfour millimeters in size the nucleus\naccumbens is almost a centimeter in size\nwow I didn't realize it was that large\nyeah it sort of like reminds me of\ndiscussions around the amygdala everyone\nthinks amygdala fear but Miguel has got\na lot of different sub-regions and\nstimulation of certain areas of the\nmegdala makes people feel great that's\nright another stimulation of other\nerrors makes them feel terribly afraid\nexactly and that shouldn't surprise us\nbecause you know when we treat patients\nwith Parkinson's disease for Tremor you\nknow if we're in one part of the\nsubthalamic nucleus will help their\nTremor if we're in another part of the\nsubthalamic nucleus the neurologist is\nlooking at me like why isn't this\nworking and that shouldn't surprise us\nwe already know that you know two or\nthree millimeters deviation or two or\nthree millimeters away from where we\nwant to be and you might not have the\nresult you want and that's probably also\ntrue for these more limbic structures\nlike the amygdala and the nucleus\naccumbens uh so you know regarding the\nnucleus accumbens we Traverse some of\nthe nucleus accumbens not all of it in\norder to place the electrode that we\nwant to use to\ndetect when Cravings are happening for\nexample and to try to block the Cravings\nfrom leading to the behavior related to\nthe the reward seeking which is the\novereating in this case\nuh\nso what we decided to do in the\noperating room was\nto actually try to leverage a tool that\nwe use all the time when we take care of\npatients with Parkinson's so with\nParkinson's these a lot of these\npatients not all have Tremor and so when\nwe place an electrode into this motor\nstructure\nto try to improve their movement\ndisorder we often can hear Trevor cells\nand they sound we convert their\nelectrical signal to an audible signal\nso we can actually hear it\num and it sounds kind of like the Tremor\nlooks like the frequency of the signal\nis the same as the handshaking\nexactly and so the the patient with\nParkinson's is is Trump trembling Yep\nthey're awake and you're poking around\nin a in a dedicated careful way of\ncourse one poke at a time one poke at a\ntime with a very fine wire a set of\nwires listening to the electrical\nactivity until you\nyou encounter some cells that are\nsending out electrical activity that's\nright at a similar frequency exactly and\nthen you can stimulate them or quiet\nthem and see if the Tremor goes away so\nwe we are very confident that when we\nstimulate that area of in this case the\nsubcollamic nucleus uh\nwe will make that Tremor we will disrupt\nthat Tremor circuit and that Tremor will\ndissolve and it does that's why\nParkinson's is so beautiful and\ninspiring and uh from us retractable\nyeah exactly but what is the it makes us\nfeel we understand the brain right at\nleast in that limited way so what is the\num analog to Tremor in terms of appetite\nand desire to binge craving\nso craving is a term that you know\nthere's probably other terms we could\nuse by the way but that that's the term\nwe've chosen to use for a number of\nreasons one because people relate with\nthat term people that have binge eating\ndisorder or obesity they if you ask them\nif they crave the answer will often be\nyes\num if you ask them if they lose control\nor binge they might not know what you\nmean or they might not actually feel out\nof control even when they are\num so uh but the word craving is\nrelatable and so we set out to see if we\ncould identify craving cells\num in a patient with OCD which is\nrelated in fact we target a very similar\npart of the brain\nwe tried to identify\ncells related to obsessions and we\nbelieve we did do that it was a single\ncase study uh where we tried to optimize\nwhere our electrode was placed so we had\nsome proof of concept that we would be\nable to elicit a sort of\ndisease-specific symptom in the\noperating room assuming the patient\ncould tolerate being awake not everybody\nneeds to be awake for this procedure but\nat least for these first and human\ntrials where\num we're trying we're trying to\nestablish where in the brain we need to\nbe uh I think this type of approach is\nreally critical and you know\nby the way none of this has been\npublished uh but I think it's so\nimportant for people to know this so I I\nam willing to share some aspects of what\nwe're trying to do\num but uh but that's that's really the\nfirst goal of this trial is to identify\nwhere the nucleus accumbens we can\ndetect these craving cells so we have to\nprovoke food craving in the operating\nroom that's the first thing how do you\ndo that ah well um there are some uh\nsomewhat validated ways to do that so\nfor example we asked patients to provide\npictures of food that they rate very\nhighly as something that they would\ntypically crave and you know depending\non the patient it might be something\nthat's very salty it could be very sweet\nlike a donut\num oh that's very good I love donuts\nright Donuts are great you should you\nshould try the Cronut when you're here\nin New York City I just might I try not\nto eat that sort of thing for all the\nreasons\njust try to stop yourself after that one\nso if I were one of these patients given\nthe fact that uh the binges come on\npretty seldom once a day do you you I\nimagine you have them come to the the\noperating room fasted or semi-fasted\nthey're faster okay they're fasted which\nprobably they're probably surgical\nreasons for wanting that too they kind\nof have to be right and then you they've\nyou've done the craniotomy removed a\npatch of skull yes you've lowered the\nwire into the nucleus accumbens and then\nthey are viewing pictures of food that\nthey crave and thinking of about it do\nthey have olfactory cues smells of\ncronuts yeah I would love to do the\nolfactory because we haven't implemented\nthat but that is a great uh thank you\nfor and I'll give you full credit when\nwe do review the grant but it sounds I'm\nso glad this work is funded because I\nmean this is what I I'll make this time\nit's not a joke when I refer to you all\nuh you neurosurgeons uh as the\nastronauts of the brain you know this is\nout on the\nextreme edge of what we don't know about\nhow the brain functions and this is so\nfar and away different than giving a\nmouse access to a high high fat food not\nthat I'm not being disparaging in the\nmouse work but so the person says\nwell I'm the patient in this case so I\nmight say you know I'm hungry a donut\nsounds really good right now but craving\nto me is like I you know I'll cross the\nstreet cross town be late for my meeting\neat three of these yes maybe even hide\nthat from somebody that cares about me\nthat doesn't want me doing this this\nkind of thing hide it from myself yes\nthese kinds of behaviors I'm projecting\nand I'm fortunate that\num I I have cravings for things in life\nbut uh Donuts are not among the more\nextreme of them so\num so this is all happening in real time\nand you're listening to the cells the\nsame way you would listen to it and\nsearch for Tremor cells exactly same\nexact tools and you're doing that by\num recording from a small population of\ncells in the area yeah in fact we do get\nmulti-unit activity which is multiple\ncells uh but we really try to find one a\nsingle unit to listen to one neuron yeah\nbecause it's just um much easier to\nunderstand what that one neuron is doing\nversus trying to listen to and we also\nmeasure local field potential recordings\nbut those are analyzed which is more of\na population response thousands of cells\nkind of a porous of cells exactly\num that we measure offline\num the device that we use to\num\nsort of treat these patients or\nintervene uh that we're studying it\ncan't do single unit recordings it's\nonly doing these more population\nresponses so we correlate what we see in\nthe operating room at the single unit\nlevel to the population response but we\ndo that all offline\num I can explain that in a moment uh\nbut yes so we we try to identify these\ncraving cells and uh because this is a\nfeasibility study\num and we can't\nyou know be in the operating I'm\nsearching for hours and hours and hours\nwe do have some sort of we have\nguidelines that we've set for ourselves\nthat we've uh developed with the NIH or\nthe FDA to make sure that what we're\ndoing is feasible and safe as well\num so we we will spend a limited time\ntrying to identify these uh craving\ncells but another\nuh sort of um strategy that we think is\nreally important is\num the effect of the stimulation so a\nlot of patients and this gets to sort of\nyour question earlier about what kind of\nwhat comes first\num you know a lot of people when they\nwhen they binge or they lose control\nover food\num or seek drugs that moment of\nvulnerability is preceded by\nwhat we call a a moment of sort of\npre-meal negative effect which basically\nmeans right before they binge they're\nfeeling down or they feel stressed or\nanxious\nand they compensate for that momentary\nsymptom by binging or losing control\nover food not everybody needs criteria\nfor a binge so I try to specify that we\nare we are looking at loss of control\neating specifically just because the\nCriterion of a binge is not as critical\nfor us\num\nso um so what we want to be able to do\nis trigger stimulation when this craving\nis detected by the device uh\nbut we trigger it only when the craving\nis there and we believe that if we can\nsort of\ntemporarily Elevate their mood ever so\nbriefly again this is about five to ten\nseconds of stimulation only that perhaps\nthat elevation in mood could actually\nsort of\ndisrupt the\ncraving to binge cycle\nmaybe that's a habit maybe it's not but\nif you crave and then you binge if we\ncan interrupt that with this moment of\nfeeling good\nthat might be a really good therapy for\na patient and in fact\nwhen we do deep brain stimulation for\nobsessive-compulsive disorder we can\nfairly reliably induce a positive affect\nthe problem is that it's not sustained\nand the reason it's likely not sustained\nis because with obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder we treat that condition with\ncontinuous stimulation\nand it's not surprising that over time\nthe effect kind of goes away so when\nthey're in the clinic and we turn the\ndevice on our patients feel great and we\nfeel like we've solved the problem\nbut they call us the next day and\nthey're like you know my my depression\ncame back or my OCD hasn't gotten better\nand my moods back to where it was can\nyou can you get it back to where it was\nyesterday because that felt great the\nbrain loves homeostatic regulation it\ndoes and it does not like to shift\npatterns regression to the norm right\num and I think there's sort of a\ntolerance effect there\num that uh is is limiting the effect of\ncontinuous stimulation and actually in a\nmouse if you do continuous stimulation\num the the sort of blockade of binge\neating goes away so actually in a mouse\nwe've actually demonstrated\num we published this not too long ago in\npnas that if you deliver stimulation\nintermittently and only when sort of a\ncraving signal is detected so to speak\num\nthat that X that effect will be the most\nrobust and durable\num but if you deliver it continuously\nactually the benefit goes away over time\nso I've always encouraged my colleagues\nto consider more of an episodic\nstimulation approach rather than\ncontinuous deep brain stimulation but of\ncourse that that's for these more\nepisodic conditions whereas these more\nquote unquote State disorders uh as I\noversimplified earlier they might need\nmore of a continuous therapy so that's\ndefinitely subject for a lot of research\nin the future\num so in any case um the goal in the\noperating room was to identify a craving\ncell\num deliver stimulation safely but also\nto capture a moment of elevated mood we\nwere able uh to do that as we we are in\nour OCD patients as well\nand also to get an interoperative CAT\nscan we have devices now in the\noperating room that allow us to get\nImaging in real time they're fabulous\ntools that we didn't have 10 years ago\nso we can confirm accuracy\num you know where the you can see where\nthe electrode is exactly precisely\nexactly\num you know with 0.5 millimeters of air\nso super precise uh or as precise as we\nthink we need to be\num and we use connectomics so there's a\ntool in brain Imaging called\ntractography where we can actually\nmeasure circuit connections it's it's an\nindirect assay but we believe it's\npowerful it has its uh assumptions but\num like anything in in science but we\ncould actually\nmap out where the nucleus accumbens\nconnects to the prefrontal cortex sort\nof the cortical control inhibitory\ncontrol pathway and where that pathway\nintersects with the nucleus accumbens\nand we can Target that area\num structurally so those three goals of\nthe surgery we we aim to set up to\naccomplish and we believed if we\nachieved two of those three that we\nwould have a successful result in our in\nour early trial\namazing\ngiven that at least to me the\nnon-clination that anorexia is the\nmirror image of binge eating disorder\nand at least from what I learned one of\nthe more deadly psychiatric conditions\nyeah um but also quite common yes\num\nis it possible that nucleus accumbens\nthis\nso-called reward circuit is also\ninvolved in anorexia but somehow it is\nthe resistance to eating the craving of\nthe fasted state or something like that\nthat's being reinforced and and I asked\nthis for two reasons one because I'm\ngenuinely curious about anorexia of\nobserved anorexia in a number of people\nthat I know and it's a striking thing to\nsee somebody just resist food despite\nall\nbetter knowledge of the fact that\nthey're getting quite ill maybe even at\nrisk of death but the other reason is\nthat\nif in fact nucleus accumbens is the site\nwhich can Harbor cells to promote\ncraving and craving of fasted States so\nto speak then that I think might tell us\nsomething fundamental about how the\nbrain works which is that structures\ndon't control functions per se\nstructures control dynamics of\ninteractions sort of like a\nOrchestra conductor has a certain number\nof operations that they perform but\nreally their main function is to\ncoordinate the actions of a lot of\nthings not to make sure that the violins\nalways play in a certain way alongside\nthe oboes you can tell I'm not a\nmusician here\nI actually have an appreciation for the\nopenings yes those usually get left out\nwhat's that the obos yeah they usually\nget ignored my partner plays the elbows\noh yeah so yeah I think it's a great\nanalogy by the way\num\nyou know I I make this statement it's a\nlittle controversial but I actually\nthink people would understand where it's\nwhere I'm coming from\num across all of these sort of\nsub-specialties of medicine uh but I\nactually think especially with obesity\nremember it's a phenotype that's\nreflective uh often but not always of a\nbehavior\num but if you consider patients that\nhave obesity and they they exhibit some\nsort of compulsion towards food so they\nthey overeat despite the risk of it I\nthink those kinds of patients are more\nsimilar to anorexics than they are\ndifferent\num anorexia and obesity are both\nphenotypes that are at least in this\nspecific case of obesity and in anorexia\na result of a compulsion to either over\nor under eat despite the risk these\ntypes of compulsions are driven by\nsocietal pressures\nbrain vulnerabilities that are probably\nmore similar than they are different\nthey just happen to manifest differently\nwhy they manifest differently is\nprobably related to each predisposition\nor perhaps preference that's hard to\nknow like you I have a personal\nconnection to these Eating Disorders\nanorexia included and uh yeah I think\nit's um\nit's very scary and it's a condition\nthat\noften instills fear in psychiatrists\nbecause I think you know not not\neverybody by the way I mean I have some\nphenomenal psychiatrists that I work\nwith both at Stanford and at Penn\nthey're also involved in my obesity\nstudy that take care of these patients I\nmean these are heroes but there's a lot\nof psychiatrists that are not in this\ndomain that find anorexia scared for the\nreason you said it has the highest\nmortality of all psychiatric conditions\nthat includes depression because not\nonly can these patients die of suicide\nbut they die of metabolic complications\nof being underweight\num so it's a uh it is it is a scary\ncondition I I relate with that I am\ntrying over time to bridge what I'm\ndoing in obesity and binging disorder to\natorexia for two reasons one because I\nthink these problems are more similar\nthan they are different and two because\nof the need\num and I think we're well positioned to\nsort of tackle anorexia\num using similar approaches not\nidentical but but similar approaches um\nthe nucleus accumbens has been studied\nin patients with anorexia in China\nactually my postdoc my first postdoc who\nI had the honor to train uh when I was\nat Stanford as a neurosurgeon in China\nwhen before he came to me actually was\ninvolved in a trial of anorexia that had\nsome benefits\num and uh there's studies in Europe\num and elsewhere that have examined\npreliminarily uh the effects of deep\nbrain stimulation targeting the nucleus\naccumbens uh for anorexia colleagues of\nmine in Canada Andres lozado is a\nwonderful neurosurgeon scientist has\nbeen studying the effects of going after\nArea 25 which is directly connected to\nthe nucleus accumbens by\num you know it's a monosynaptic\nconnection so in a lot of ways you know\nperhaps delivering stimulation there\ncould could be very similar to\ndelivering stimulation with nucleus\naccumbens it's all part of one critical\ninhibitory control circuit he's seen\nbenefits as well\num\nso I I definitely think there's some\nevidence that this is an area that we\nneed to be studying\num I think our more episodic approach\nwith response to stimulation going after\nsort of a signal in the nucleus\naccumbens that seems to be related to\nthe compulsion to withhold from eating I\nthink is what we will be trying to\naccomplish uh in our study it's a\nright now just being conceived though uh\nyeah these studies they move so slowly\nbecause you have to get a grant that\nGrant gets reviewed by the NIH six\nmonths after you submit it often gets\nrejected because it's too Innovative and\ntoo high risk so then you have to edit\nit and decrease the risk so it takes by\nobesity so it took two years to get\nfunded\nand I worry about that time frame\nbecause that's a lot of time for\npatients with anorexia to suffer that I\nmight be able to help at least in a\nsmall sample of patients so\num but that that is the nature of how\nthese things go you also have to get FDA\napproval to do these kinds of things we\ntry to do all of this in parallel it's\nan enormous undertaking and in a lot of\nways we're starting from scratch but in\nsome ways we have some preliminary data\nto go after this so my hope is in about\na year we'll have a similar trial for\nanorexia at Penn so so more to come on\nthat\num and and we're not the only lab that's\ntrying to go after because of the the\nclear need so what is the status of\nnon-invasive brain stimulation ablation\nand blocking activity in the brain I get\na lot of questions about transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation yeah I've actually\nhad that done as a research subject sure\nwhen I was at Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab\nput a coil on my head I was tapping my\nfinger in concert to a uh a drum beat\nand then all of a sudden uh because of\nthe stimulation it was impossible for me\nto keep time yes with the drum beat\nthat's cool cool it's a pretty wild\nexperience to not have motor control and\nuh than to have motor control returned\nat the flip of a switch when someone\nelse is controlling the switch it makes\nit especially Eerie\num so my understanding is that\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation is\nbeing used to treat depression and a\nnumber of other brain syndromes\nnon-invasively so no no drilling through\nthe skull the surgeons don't like that\nsurgeons love to cut and drill with\npurpose but they do\num but uh my understanding is that the\nspatial Precision isn't that great\num ultrasound is something I hear a lot\nabout these days\num and my understanding is that\nultrasound can allow researchers and\nclinicians to stimulate specific brain\nareas perhaps with more Precision\num maybe you could just give us a\ncoverage of what those are being used\nfor what are your thoughts on on um uh\nthese forms of non-invasive meaning no\nno flipping open of a piece of the skull\ntype brain stimulation and blockade of\nbrain activity sure yeah I wanted to\nclarify also these these surgeries\ngenerally don't\num by the way require a full craniotomy\nit's usually just a small opening about\nthe size of a dime in the bone so just\njust to clarify but that's painless too\nright uh well usually without pain yeah\nthere's a little bit of scalp numbing we\ngive a scalp block and the patients are\ngetting IV sedations so they in general\ndon't feel anything and if they do they\ntell me and we give them more local\nanesthetic but that's they're usually\nasleep during that part so it's\nminimally invasive but you know in a lot\nof ways there's no such thing as a\nminimally invasive procedure in the\nbrain you know it's a it's kind of so\nglad to hear you say that oh no I you\nknow I'm I'm not one of those\nneurosurgeons that you've probably\nencountered and we have mutual friends\nthat uh and you know these mutual\nfriends are some of my favorite people\nin neurosurgery and they probably\nactually think more like me than than\nnot but there are neurosurgeons that\nyou're absolutely right and this is true\nfor all surgeries they really\nin a lot of ways they think what they do\nis sort of the ground truth or is it\ncloser to the ground truth and I I get\nthat\num uh you know probing with purpose I I\nactually really like that I'm going to\nuse that if you don't mind\num just it's just describing what you do\nso yeah but I I actually have I've\nalways said this I've said it publicly\nI've said it to my boss I've said this\nto my team\num we need to embrace non-invasive\napproaches\num\nsome of them are a little fluffy\num fluffy in that we don't understand\nhow they work\nwe don't necessarily understand how deep\nbrains too much works by the way so\num but because we don't know exactly how\nthey work\nthey're not as precise as we would like\nthem to be so we have work to do there\nand I actually think that work is doable\nand actually underway\num you know at Stanford we have great\ncollaborators that that I think are\ndoing this people like Nolan Williams\nand Connor Liston at Cornell and others\num so we uh I think that\nTMS transcranial magnetic stimulation it\nis FDA approved for depression by the\nway it's also FDA approved for OCD and\nfor nicotine addiction where do they put\nthe coil for those three or more or less\nyeah so they put it over was always on\nthe scalp and uh over the frontal lobe\nand there's different parts of the\nfrontal lobe that have been demonstrated\nto be a little better or a little bit\nworse\num but what the FDA has approved for\ndepression I believe is uh similar to\nwhat's been approved for uh OCD but for\naddiction I believe it is a different\nTarget but we'd have to ask our our TMS\nexperts on that can they direct the\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation deep\nbelow the cortex they try uh and we're\nwe're actually studying this in OCD\npatients now\num I as a part of our invasive trial uh\nwhere we are trying to pull patients\nfrom a TMS trial that's in parallel to\nwhat we're doing\num all funded by the foundation for OCD\nresearch\nwhere we believe we can use TMs to to\ndefine a circuit that if modulated\nimproves OCD albeit temporarily and in\nthose patients if it's temporary they\nwould be appropriate for an invasive\nstudy so something we're actively\nworking on I've always believed that\nneurosurgeons need to be part of the\ndiscussion with these non-invasive\napproaches we don't need to do them but\nI think we can help make them more\nprecise and to probe non-invasively with\npurpose\nrather than this more kind of\nI don't know a non-invasive blast effect\nkind of you know\nI I just can't imagine how that is going\nto be as effective as probing with\npurpose but you can do that not\ninvasively as well and I think we need\nto do better uh in that way I do believe\nthat's possible and I think people are\nactively trying to do it\num getting deep in the brain with TMS I\nthink will always be hard but you can\nget there indirectly by using\nconnectivity assays and targeting\nsuperficial structures that have\nHigh connectivity to deep structures so\nfor example\num perhaps one day there will be a TMS\nTarget for anorexia and obesity\nif we are scratching the surface with\ninvasive approaches to these problems\nwe we're even doing less with the brain\nstimulation\num so we have so much work to do there\neating disorders and TMS have been so\num sort of scarcely studied or or there\nhave been so such little research done\nin that in that space and so it is an\narea that we need to to work on\num for the obvious reason for example in\na patient with anorexia just thinking\npractically you know placing a device in\na patient who is significantly\nunderweight might not be the best\napproach you know wound erosion and\nissues like that could come up so\ndeveloping a non-invasive approach I\nthink is critical the problem is where\ndo we target\nand so the only way to answer that I\nthink reliably is to accept that we have\nto get into the Brain before we're out\nof the brain and with these kinds of\nconditions we're only just starting to\nget into the brain you know so I I worry\nthat we're a long way away from a\nnon-invasive approach that really works\nconsistently\num sorry to interrupt um I want to make\nsure we touch on ultrasound because yes\num but um his\nhistorically it seemed that there was a\nbit more permission for people to probe\naround in the human brain I I've um\nsometimes refer the podcast to some of\nthese papers that were done uh allowing\npatients to self-stimulate in the brain\nthese are work done in the in the 60s\nand now his name Escapes Me Robert\num anyway there's a couple papers\npublished in science allowing patients\nto stimulate a couple different brain\nareas asking which ones they preferred\nand I was always shocked and slightly\nintrigued by the fact that the the brain\narea that all three of these patients\nwho I don't think had any syndromes I\nthink they volunteered for these\nexperiments I don't think you could do\nthis anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah\nI think uh was not the same as it is now\nthings have changed\num fortunately but they\num all three of them seem to like some\nmidline thalamic structure which for\nthose listening it's just area kind of\nin the in the dead center of the brain\num more or less that evoked a sense of\nkind of frustration and anger which\nsurprised me because I would have\nthought oh it's Robert Heath his\nexperiments rather than patients\npreferring to stimulate areas that evoke\nlaughter or Joy or a feeling of\ndrunkenness or Delight it also explains\na lot of what I observe in social media\nthis sort of um kind of people\nrepeatedly engaging in battles\num that are kind of trivial it seems\nlike frustration and anger might have\nits own reward circuitry anyway I don't\nwant to go too far down that rabbit hole\nbut it\num it's a deep one it's a deep one and\nand kind of gets to our nature yeah you\nknow as humans and what we find\ninteresting or rewarding but you know\nthe ability the inability to probe\naround the brain in a safe way without\nthe need for somebody to be very sick\nwould be I think would be enormously\npowerful and at least in my mind if I\nwere in charge which I'm not\num would offer the opportunity to really\ncome to an understanding about how the\nhuman brain works without all these\nissues of how to translate from Mouse\nstudies and again there's huge value to\nanimal studies as we both agree but\num so many of the things that we want to\nknow about the human brain involve\nasking the person hey do you what do you\nfeel when that set of neurons is\nstimulated and what don't you feel uh\nand a mouse we can ask and ask but\nthey're not going to tell us something\nthey do tell us they're not going to\ntell us in English so\num how do we overcome this challenge but\nfirst\nultrasound or if you prefer after\nultrasound what is ultrasound going to\nbe really useful towards solving these\nclinical issues and these basic issues\nyeah so I think\num\nlet's start with ultrasound then we'll\ncome back to it um so ultrasound right\nnow\ntranscranial magnetic\nmagnetic resonance guided Focus\nultrasound so\num uh this this is an FDA approved\nmethod\nto\ndeliver an ablation to the brain\nnon-invasively\nthere are researchers myself included\nthat are trying to use transcranial\nmagnetic guided magnetic resonance\nguided Focus ultrasound or MRI guided\nFocus ultrasound\nto use it in a modulatory way not just\nas an ablation but to drive neuronal\nactivity or inhibit it perhaps we're\nstill learning how to do that\num there are trials that are trying to\nunderstand if you can use ultrasound to\nopen the blood-brain barrier so you can\ndeliver a medication to that specific\narea uh perhaps for a brain tumor or\nsomething like that\nso um it's a very exciting field\num and it is FDA approved for Tremor\nright now and so I actually do it\nroutinely\num\nfor patients with Tremor with\nParkinson's or a central Tremor and so\num I I love doing it it's uh often just\nkind of a miracle because there's no\nincision I don't have to place an\nelectrode into the brain to achieve a\nsimilar result how early into the\npathology of Parkinson's can someone\nthink about approaching this so for\ninstance if somebody has a parent or a\nsibling and they're developing some\nresting Tremor yeah obviously they\nshould talk to a neurologist but a\nneurosurgeon but this non-invasive\napproach could be incredible for them as\nopposed to just take only taking drugs\nto increase dopamine levels yeah so um\ndepending on the reason you have Tremor\nwould dictate the kind of medication you\nwould use it could be Parkinson's but if\nit's not it might be a central Trevor by\nthe way essential tremors 10 times as\ncommon as Parkinson's really essential\ntremor is the most common neurologic\ncondition in patients over the age of\n70. we often aren't aware of that people\nwith essential Trevor feel they have\ntheir forgotten disease because there's\nno Michael J fox for a central Tremor I\nsent a letter sorry is it essential\ntremor or or essential\num\nI actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton\nI I've observed uh Tremor in him and I\nthink he's actually disclosed that he\nhas it and I hoped he'd become a\nchampion for for patients with a central\nTremor um Sandra Day O'Connor does as\nwell she's also public about it but I I\nwas not able to get them eager to become\nthe champion for this condition but like\nMichael J fox these patients need a\nchampion like that\num but unfortunately it's a bit of a\nforgotten disease nevertheless because\nof the FDA approval of focus ultrasound\nfor Tremor\num another's trying to get some\nattention for sure and uh it's\nfabulously effective for these patients\nit treats patients on one side usually\ntheir dominant hand or their worst hand\nand it um it really speaks to the fact\nthat wow you can deliver non-invasively\nan ablation to the brain in a\nhypothesized zone that we think is\nrelated to the problem at hand and at\nleast with Tremor it works really well\ncould this be effective for psychiatric\ndisease obesity Eating Disorders uh well\num perhaps uh actually that would be the\nideal the problem is we don't know where\nto do the ablation\num there is a trial that we would like\nto do for OCD where we would deliver an\nablation to the same area of the brain\nthat we've been delivering ablations to\nfor years for patients with OCD and it\nhelps a bit that's called a capsulotomy\num but really the outcome is probably\ngoing to be about the same it's a nice\nmethod because it's non-invasive but we\nneed to find a new Target for these for\nthese conditions and because of the\ncommon denominator of the urge despite\nthe risk sort of that compulsion\num yeah perhaps it could be the same\nTarget I don't know\num but I would argue we need to do these\nmodulatory experiments either with a\ndevice or with uh invasive recordings uh\nto better understand where these\nproblems are coming from to Define where\nwe should do an ultrasound treatment so\num you're right historically\nwithout much regulation we've we've\nprobed the brain\num\nthe problem we can't learn a lot from\nthose experiments now uh well in this\nway at least we don't know exactly where\nthose electrodes were we didn't have MRI\nscanning or high quality cat scanning to\nto know where those electrodes were with\ncertainty\nwhere and we know two or three\nmillimeters matters and we also didn't\nhave the tools to place electrodes in a\nprecise way back then so unfortunately\nwe can't learn a lot from those\nexperiments right now\nso we're sort of redesigning them and\nthere is a way to do it now\num patients with epilepsy benefit from\nthis all the time there has been a\nrevolution in America it was in Europe\nbefore it was in America where we would\ndo stereo encephalography which is\nbasically like doing an EEG of patients\nwith epilepsy but with invasive\nelectrodes and we would Place tiny\nlittle wires less than a millimeter in\ndiameter all throughout the brain into\nparts of the brain that we believe are\ninvolved in seizures and we would admit\nthe patients to the hospital and figure\nout where the seizures were starting and\npropagating and then um you know we\ncould stimulate these electrodes to see\nif there was a symptom that was\nimportant and I try to identify a region\nthat we thought we could either remove\nsurgically ablate with a laser or put a\nstimulator in it perhaps that's\ncommonplace now for epilepsy\num\nand it works extremely well and it's\nvery safe of course it's still a brain\nprocedure but the uh the complication\nrate is surprisingly low quite honestly\nfor the amount of electors that we place\num and it's extremely well tolerated\nmost these patients leave the hospital\nand they don't even feel like they've\nhad surgery\nso uh there's actually a lot of interest\nin using that procedure to study mental\nhealth disorders\nwe are trying to do it for patients with\nobsessive compulsive disorder we're\nawaiting an FDA decision on that uh but\nactually I credit uh our colleagues at\nBaylor and at UCSF for for studying this\nuh already we have fabulous colleagues\nat UCSF that have studied depression\nusing this type of approach a mutual\nfriend of ours uh you know Eddie Chang\nwho's a wonderful friend and colleague\nsomebody I've emulated for many years as\nwell uh and and the the Psychiatry team\nat UCSF have worked together on this\nsort of\nbringing together the epilepsy technique\nand the Psychiatry expertise to study\nhow we could better Target electrodes in\ndepression and I'll tell you if they\nhave a consistent Target\nperhaps there becomes an ultrasound\nTarget\num but right now the approach is a bit\nmore reversible because you can always\nshut that electrode off or even remove\nthe electrode if perhaps it's not in the\noptimal location to treat the depression\nuh but actually after a large volume of\ncases perhaps they could pool that data\nto develop a a new ultrasound Target for\ndepression I think that would be\nfabulous and probably is their long-term\ngoal\num not to speak for them but that would\nbe something that I I'm sure is on their\nradar and a Baylor is trying to do the\nsame thing for depression their\napproaches are a little bit different\nbut a similar tool to try to understand\nuh depression and you know we're working\nwith all these types of uh colleagues\nsome of these are our friends to try to\nto bring this to OCD as well and you\nknow it makes sense to try to do this\nfor addiction and obesity and anorexia\nyou might ask well why aren't you doing\nthis for obesity right now in uh in our\nin our study and the reason is that\num we've developed a target for obesity\nuh and binge eating disorder uh\ndeveloped out of mice that we believe\num is relevant for the human State\nbecause you can model this problem in a\nmouse a bit better than you can model\ndepression or OCD so we feel like we can\nrely on the pre-clinical studies more\nwhereas with these perhaps more I don't\nwant to say more complicated but more\nhuman mental health conditions that are\nhard to model in a mouse you really have\nto study it in the human and you can\nperhaps start in an epileptic patient a\npatient that has electrodes and try to\nprovoke a depressed state or study\nepileptics like Dr Chang has done that\nhave comorbid depression for example and\nthat can really validate this approach\nas well but in the end it's it's getting\ninto the human brain that we need to do\nin the disease specifically that will\neventually lead to a non invasive\napproach either a lesion or modulatory\napproach modulatory would be like TMS or\nlesion approach would be with ultrasound\ncouldn't agree more\nmeanwhile because there are many many\nmillions of people suffering from\ndepression Eating Disorders Parkinson's\nand essential tremor\nEtc\nwell first of all I should say based on\neverything you've told me thus far it's\namazing to me that any pharmacologic\ntreatments work because of how systemic\nthey are and impacting serotonin\nserotonergic neurons over here in\ndopaminergic neurons over there and not\ntargeting any specific batch of cells it\nmakes perfect sense as to why all the\nside effects exist\nbut earlier you said something that\nreally grabbed my attention I want to\ncome back to which is that\nif people can be made to feel or make\nthemselves feel just a little bit better\na little less anxious just prior to a\ncraving episode or a binge episode\nmaybe even if people can become better\nat detecting their own internal States\nand when they're kind of veering toward\na binge or veering toward using a drug\nor\nmaybe even veering towards suicidal\nthinking\nI based on what you said earlier that\nthose kind of um\npre-behavioral States\nthe kind of drift on the on the steering\num\nthose sound like powerful\nlevels of awareness at least for now\nuntil we have specific sites in the\nbrain that we can Target non-invasive\nmethods that could be deployed to\nmillions and millions of people seems\nlike that awareness seems like maybe\namong the best tools that people could\ndevelop yes 100 agree with you you know\nso for the person with OCD or uh who\nsuffers from anorexia or binge eating\ndisorder and to their clinicians you\nknow I I just want to highlight that you\nsaid that I mean I'm not again I'm not a\nclinician I always say this I don't\nprescribe anything I profess things\num and uh but\nawareness of one's thinking seems\nimmensely powerful in this context yeah\num and after all it is the clinical\nprobe that you use because the if let's\nsay the patient were to lie to you about\ntheir experience of\nwhat happens in their mind when you\nstimulate you could basically the whole\nthing the whole surgery the whole\nprocedure could go badly wrong so it's\nit's up to the patient to be of course\nhonest with you in their their\nincentivized to do that but to be honest\nwith themselves about ah you know I've\ngone all day without a binge but you\nknow the the smell of a donut or the\nthought of a donut is starting to have a\nparticular Allure that awareness seems\nlike an incredibly powerful thing to own\nand to and to build and cultivate yes\nI've always thought that if we could\nimprove awareness we can improve\noutcomes I think that's probably true\nfor many of these patients the problem I\nthink comes down to the fact that some\nof these patients are so resistant to\ntreatment\nand the patients that we see as a\nsurgeon for example are the patients\nthat they've tried cognitive behavioral\ntherapy certainly have tried medications\nthey've tried Behavioral Management they\nare aware of their problem and they've\nshown that to us they can tell us when\nthey're craving\nbut despite the craving and despite\nbeing involved in this invasive brain\nsurgical trial highly you know first in\nhuman novel study which I think will\nhave a positive effect but it's still\nexperimental uh they still can't stop\nthemselves so there\nsort of as made aware as could possibly\nbe did I use grammar there correctly I\nthink so\num they're as aware as they could\npossibly be and they still lose control\nwe've had this studied in the lab so we\nwill bring patients to the laboratory\nwith this implanted device\nto to try to provoke this electrographic\nelectrical signal that can be detected\nby the actual device that will stimulate\nthem when they're at home\nbut before we actually initiate\nstimulation we want us to see can this\ndevice detect this craving cell signal\nwhich is going to be different than what\nwe saw in the operating room because\nthat's a single cell but these devices\nthese electrodes are about a millimeter\nin diameter instead of like a tenth of a\nmillimeter which is what we use in the\noperating room\num so they're they're only hearing or or\ndetecting I should say thousands of\ncells responses and\nwe actually have a way to provoke\nbinges it's called a mood provocation\nit's very well well very well validated\nit's a little bit like provoking\nseizures in the epilepsy monitoring unit\nbut here in these sort of uh psychiatric\nmonitoring unit or the the food\nmonitoring unit uh we we actually have a\npsychiatrist and eating disorder\nSpecialists come and\ninduce a mood that is related to\neach patient's sort of self-described\nbinge episode so the psychiatrist comes\nin and provokes yes a feeling that can\nevoke the negative behavior that's\nexactly right so that we can video and\nsynchronize the video to the brain\nsignal recordings\num the patients all wear an eye tracker\nso we can see what they're eating at all\ntimes and what they're looking at\nspecifically and that allows us to have\nthe best temporal resolution possible to\nunderstand what is happening right\nbefore the bite\nand even under video surveillance\nthrough a one day one-way mirror in a\nlaboratory setting when patients are\nvery well aware that their there to be\nstudied if they're going to binge\nthey still do and we believe they do\nbecause they just can't control it as\naware as they are of it\nand it's probably because they're the\nmost severe\nso I think if we can improve awareness\nnot just the societal awareness that I\nwas talking about earlier but the\npatient awareness around their problem I\nthink that could be a powerful way to\nhelp so many of these patients and\nthat's sort of the role of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy\num the problem with cognitive behavioral\ntherapy or should say the limitation of\nit I actually don't have any problem\nwith it I think it's a wonderful\ntreatment\num\nis that if you stop it many of these\npatients go back to their old behaviors\nI don't say old habits but it might be a\nhabit but the old behaviors\nand so um\nthat's the problem is it's not\nnecessarily lasting in the absence of\ncontinued cognitive behavioral therapy\nsome people can benefit from it long\nterm but some can't uh\nbut I think in in in the less severe\npatients improving awareness key but in\nthese really refractory patients this is\nthis is kind of like this is the disease\ndespite the awareness they can't control\nthemselves and that's what we're trying\nto restore is that improved ability to\ncontrol their behavior\ndo you think there's a role for machines\nand artificial intelligence here uh\nthere are a couple Laboratories up at\nthe University of Washington that are\nusing\nparticular signature patterns of within\nvoice to try and help\nsuicidal people who are suicidally\ndepressed\nknow when they're headed towards an\nepisode before they even can consciously\nknow so this gets right down issues of\nFree Will and whether or not machines\ncan be smarter than we are but you know\none could argue that some of the search\nalgorithms on Google and other search\nengines are actually more aware of our\npreferences than we are\num\nbasically what these are these are\ndevices that are listening to people\ntalk all day they're also paying\nattention to patterns of breathing and\nhow well people slept Etc integrating a\nhuge number of cues and then signaling\nsomebody with a you know a yellow light\nlike you know you're headed into a\ndepressive episode the person might say\nI feel fine or I feel pretty good this\nis kind of Baseline state for me and\nthey say ah this is where you were\npreceding the last episode that took you\ndown a deep dark trench and it took\nmonths to get out of\num I wonder whether or not some of these\ndevices could help with the sorts of\nthings that we're talking about today\nyeah I think so\num I've always said we have to get in\nthe Brain before we get out of it and if\nwe get in the brain and understand what\nthese signals look like we'll know what\nthose non-invasive signals are I think\nit's possible that we are\nscientifically sophisticated enough to\nuse machine learning\num and sort of this kind of botan\ntechnique to anticipate when somebody is\ngoing to be highly impulsive you know\nsuicide it's the most dangerous impulse\nit's something that is\nimmensely a focus of the lab is\nimpulsivity we've talked mostly about\ncompulsion compulsion being you know\ngoing after a reward or the urge despite\nthe risk\num impulsivity is is similar but\ndifferent it's it's kind of going after\nsomething\num a little bit if you if you model\nimpulsivity in a mouse it's you know\nrelated to you know going after a food\nreward without the sort of paired tone\nthat your the mouse is supposed to wait\nfor the mouse doesn't want to wait\nanymore they just go after the food\num I've been that Mouse yeah we've all\nbeen oh we could all relate with this uh\nto a certain extent against the Spectrum\nso\num\nso in any case I uh non-sequitur but I I\nI certainly think that there is a way to\nuse our own body's physiology\nto anticipate\nwhen these impulses are coming online\nhow best to do that I think we're just\nscratching the surface but these are the\nkinds of solutions we need these are\nsome of these problems are of epidemic\nproportions the largest public health\nproblems in this country in this world\nobesity opiate crisis depression\nsuicidality I mean that's like a third\nof our country maybe more probably more\nand think about it and a colleague of\nours at Stanford Psychiatry told me\nsomething that still just blows my mind\nwhich is that something like 75 percent\nof the antidepressant and anti-anxiety\nmedication that exists in the world is\nconsumed in the United States it's\namazing which is I mean that's an\noutrageous number yeah we do have an\nobsession in this country for pharmacy\nyou know and the pharmaceutical industry\nis very powerful here and probably\nrelated some aspect of capitalism I'm\ncapitalistic and just like everybody\nelse but um I do worry about that a\nlittle bit\num but you know we tend to over\nprescribe and I think we as patients\ntend to over want medication we like\nquick Solutions and sometimes\nmedications provided sometimes not or\nthey're often just abandoned depends on\nthe problem of course\nso\num but but I I agree that we need\nscalable Solutions but you know I'm a\nneurosurgeon I'm only going to be able\nto treat the most severe of patients\nwith these problems you know you know\nwe've only done about 200 000 deep brain\nstimulation surgeries ever\nso I mean the problem we're talking\nabout here is\n50 million Americans there's no\npossibility that surgeons can address\nthat problem but we could help Inspire\nan initiative to go after that kind of\nproblem or help make it more rigorous\nbecause the last thing we need is a you\nknow some sort of wearable fancy tool\nthat you know\nuh waste people's money and time you\nknow we need real therapies for these\nthings not that these devices that we're\ndiscussing are not uh I think actually\nthere's lots of promise we use machine\nlearning in the lab all the time I'm not\na an electrical engineer or the\ncomputational neuroscientist doing this\ntype of work I I just helped develop the\nhypotheses around it but um and help\nfundraise around it but I I definitely\nthink there's a future for it I just I I\nsuspect we're scratching the surface on\nhow best to do it\nlet's talk about your hands yeah sure\nall the neurosurgeons I know are you\nknow very Faithfully protect their hands\nbecause talking about insurance is too\nexpensive that's it right but I'm\nguessing that you you all are not the\nones to reach into the garbage disposal\neven if your eye is on the switch to\nmake sure that it isn't going to get\nturned on they're just too precious they\nare your livelihood yeah um and earlier\nwe talked about deadlifts uh there are\nother forms of exercise\num they're things like tennis\num they're they're drawing and painting\na full range of things that one can do\nwith their hands use your imagination\nsure\num is it true that neurosurgeons don't\ndo any uh really like heavy grip\nactivity because it can\nrefine the motor motor circuits in the\nbrain and elsewhere that can throw off\ntheir neurosurgery game\nI would say that\nmany neurosurgeons uh avoid activities\nthat put their hands at risk um another\none by the way you know there's a uh an\nannual uh softball tournament uh that uh\nneurosurgeons come to in New York City\nin Central Park with a very softball no\nI'm just kidding well actually it's\nactually a very you know typical hard\nsoftball I don't know why they call it\nsoftball and uh actually a two close\ncolleagues of mine have gotten injured\nat that tournament maybe this is a it's\nalso I must say and here I'm poking fun\nbut for those of you who are going in\nthe medical profession it's also one of\nthe more uh how should I say this well\nI'm just going to say it there's a steep\nhierarchy of training in neurosurgery\nyes\num there's a certain harshness that's\nbeen conveyed to me about the training\nuh much like Astronaut training to be\ntotally fair and so maybe this is a\ntactic to uh to weed out either the\nyounger or the older generation it says\nEvolution right we uh have to evolve and\nwe need in medical the week I guess well\nI I could say that one of the\nindividuals that got injured is one of\nthe more senior surgeons that I work\nwith now and is one of the best athletes\nthat I know and he's definitely not weak\nbut you can get injured playing these\nSports and uh that being said I can tell\nyou briefly is um I think that you know\nit's funny my my mother came to me\nrecently she's she has osteopenia and\nshe told me her doctor told her she's\nnot allowed to do deadlifts and I was\nlike okay\num that's fine uh I'm not telling you\nyou should do deadlifts I just don't\nexactly understand the relationship but\num\nI can say that I do think\nI'll give you a little story here the\nreason why I'm being a little hesitant\nto to confirm that I agree with you on\nthe deadlifts is I um\nwhen I was operating this is when I was\nat Stanford University operating and uh\nwe as I mentioned earlier we get an\ninteroperative CAT scan uh to confirm\naccuracy of our lectures I do this for\nall of my surgeries when I was reviewing\nthat CAT scan the x-ray technician\nlooked at me and said whispered into my\near he's like your posture\nreally bad embarrassing your physical\nposture while doing your surgeries yeah\nand I looked at him and I kind of wanted\nto say I won't curse but yeah exactly\nI've been doing it intermittently during\nour conversation because he made me\nrealize that I really did have bad\nposture and\num we kind of had a little brief aside\nand he I learned he was a personal\ntrainer and uh his name was Zach and he\nuh you know he said to me you know your\nposture is weak because or your posture\nis poor because you're weak you need to\nstrengthen your body and strengthen your\ncore I was like how he's like power\nlifting and I'm like I'm a little\nhesitant to do this and I'll tell you I\nstarted very slowly and I can't\nprescribe power lifting to everybody for\nthe exact reason you said um and I've\ngotten hurt doing it by the way but I do\nthink\nI I wish I started a little younger\nand I would argue that with close\nsupervision and very\nwell if you are if you have a very\nexperienced trainer which I would argue\nif you're a neurosurgeon or an astronaut\nuh or or have a highly specialized\nprofession where you need your your\nlimbs to to function dentists things\nlike that\num if you're going to take something on\nlike this it really needs to be\nextremely carefully supervised and I can\ntell you that you know my trainer had a\nprofound impact on my life and my\nposture and my my physical health and so\nuh we did deadlift I'll admit so when\nyou brought it up I kind of chuckled to\nmyself but uh yes I I have gotten mildly\nhurt deadlifting but it was when I was\ndoing it by myself and I was kind of\ncocky and I wasn't paying attention but\nwhen I was with him and he was all over\nmy technique\nit actually was the most efficient way\nfor me to feel stronger and it improved\nmy posture uh significantly and I I miss\nhim since I left California I I have a\nnew trainer in Philadelphia who's great\nbut uh uh and and I still deadlift\noccasionally with him but I uh I I can\nsay I I am opposed to deadlifting\ncallously but if you're\nextremely well monitored by it\nexperienced\num personal trainer or weight lifter uh\nI think it could be a great exercise\ngreat I love to be wrong in this case\num because I'm a huge proponent and on\nthe podcast I go on and on I mean\nthey're so there's so much data now\npointing the fact that 100 and 180 to\n200 minutes of Zone 2 cardio kind of\njogging cycling swimming type behavior\nis very healthy for everybody and we\nshould all be doing that at least that\nyes I need to as well and that\nresistance training on the order of you\nknow six hard sets per muscle group per\nweek are it's really important just to\noffset deterioration of muscles and I'm\nlearning skeletal function and tendon\nstrength and that's just to maintain\nwe're not talking about all out sets to\nAbsolute failure but as you point out\nwith um with proper form so even the\nneurosurgeons are doing this which I\nthink is is wonderful yes as a final\nquestion\num but one that I think really or maybe\nsecond to final question earlier I\ncommented on the remarkable calm at\nleast perceived calm of neurosurgeons it\ncould be caused or could be effective\nthe training but it's obvious to me why\none would want that trait in their\nneurosurgeon\num I wouldn't want to hyperactive\ncertainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon\ngiven that the margins of error are so\nso tiny the spatial scale and probably\non the temporal scale too yes and you\ndon't want people doing things in time\nthat are or being spontaneous at all\ndo you think that this branch of\nmedicine that you're in selects for\npeople that at least can know how to\ncontrol any kind of fluctuations in\nautonomic growl so they can calm\nthemselves in real time and here's a\nspecific question when I've never\noperated on the human brain although\nI've had the privilege of being in the\noperating room and seeing this with some\nof our experiments with people in VR\nit's a remarkable thing I wish for\neverybody that would get this experience\nat some point not hopefully as a patient\nunless they have a need but to observe\nit but what was just striking to me is\nthe various uh stereotype behaviors of\nthe surgeon and when I did surgeries as\na graduate student as a postdoc in the\nbrains of other types of animals I would\nfind for instance that if I started to\ntremble a little bit if I tapped my left\nfoot that my hand would stabilize a bit\nthat there's this kind of need to move\nthe body or one feels the impulse maybe\nthat's my my Tourette's like compulsions\nagain but but that one can kind of um\nsiphon off some of that energy into\nanother limb so that you could remain\nprecise so are these sorts of things\nthat I'm talking about are maybe it's\nentirely my imagination but are these\nthe sorts of things that one learns as a\nneurosurgeon how to still the body and\nstill the Mind do you have a meditative\npractice when you go into the operating\nroom if you had a particularly\nchallenging morning or or a poor night's\nsleep do you have tools that you use to\ncalibrate yourself and get yourself into\nthe Zone I think this would be very\ninteresting for people to get some\ninsight into even if they don't want to\nbe a neurosurgeon yeah I completely\nagree and I I appreciate the earlier uh\nreference to neurosurgeons as uh\nastronauts because I've also heard you\nknow us compared to Cowboys before and\nit's a little bit less flattering I uh\nyou know\nsome of what we do surgically really\ndoes require a substantial amount of\nconfidence\num and that confidence hopefully comes\nfrom years of training and experience\num\nyou always worry that the confidence is\nsort of misplaced and that that is\nproblematic luckily I you so rarely see\nthat because our training is so rigorous\nyou know we have a board of uh American\nBoard of neurological surgeons that uh\nsort of allows and and assesses surgeons\nto continue practice and holds us to a\nreally high bar I do think it tends to\nattract a certain personality uh in my\nsub-specialty as a like a deep brain\nstimulation surgeon we call it\nstereotactic and functional neurosurgery\nyou know some people have likened us to\nthe neurologists with a scalpel\num we we tend to be a bit more\nintellectual\num uh maybe maybe bedside manner is a\nlittle bit friendlier\num and then there's the vascular\nneurosurgeon who doesn't sleep and so\nthey're not as friendly there's the\nspine surgeons who operate the most and\nso they're you know busy busy busy uh we\nthere are some of these kind of\nreputations going around but I I agree\nwith you there's a sort of a common\nfeature of of a calmness across\nneurosurgeons and you know there's some\nof my obviously my favorite people my\nclosest friends\num and I I can relate with them probably\nbecause of that\num sort of a big picture they don't get\nsort of uh flustered uh they they tend\nto\nare they tend to be really good at\nfiguring out how to have quality time\nbecause we work really hard our hours\nare uh significant and so the time with\nour families our friends is less than we\nwould like it to be\num that obviously that's true for people\nwho work hard across any profession but\ndefinitely true for neurosurgeons and I\nthink that we're very good at figuring\nout how to make that time high quality\num you know even just texting with some\nof my friends\num in that are that are neurosurgeons a\ngreat friend of mine just became\nchairman at Duke and just connecting\nwith him by text which takes seconds you\nknow you feel we feel connected you know\nand I I think that's a that's a trait\namongst neurosurgeons we sort of know\nhow to cut to the chase in a way\num and prioritize our time it's a skill\nthat we probably\nhave innately but is also part of the\ntraining you know when we are interns\nnow there's a lot of work hour\nregulations that is probably quite\nappropriate by the way\num I I think our hours before were\nbordering uh on on uh on not necessarily\nlet's just say they were not ideal for\nmental health and sleep which we know\nare very important components um\ncertainly we had no time for meditation\nI definitely did not I wish I did\num now knowing what I know about\nmeditation my wife's a health coach I I\nget it I see it I I practice it myself\nwith her\num I see the value I wish I had that\ntool when I was in training because it's\nstressful\num you know you even with workout\nrestrictions we still don't sleep very\nmuch we're still at work a lot about 80\nhours you know a week throughout the\nentire career uh there are times when\nit's more because after training there's\nno work hour restrictions so sometimes I\nfeel like as faculty we get abused and\nthe trainees are a little bit more\nprotected now it definitely was the\nreverse at one point and that's also a\nhuge problem probably more of a problem\num and I'm joking a little bit I don't\nnecessarily think we're abused but\ncertainly our hours are significant\num\nbut you know they come a bit more here\nand there you know on my or days when\nI'm operating those are long days but on\nthe days that I'm lucky enough to be a\nresearcher you know uh like you those\ndays tend to be a bit gentler unless I'm\ngreat writing those days can be long as\nyou know\num so I so to answer your question I do\nthink we're we're sort of self-selected\nfor it but I also think it's part of the\ntraining you know we because of the long\nhours that we're in the hospital we're\ntaking care of sick patients and we have\nsort of a type a mentor approach where\nour mentors are hard on us\nyou know we learn to cope with our\nstress and be efficient and prioritize\nthings despite the stress of it all and\nI think you know we take from that this\nsort of calm demeanor and you know\nperhaps\num perhaps it's just amplifies what we\nwere probably drawn to because before we\ncome to neurosurgery we want rotated\nneurosurgery we might spend a month you\nknow pretending to be a neurosurgeon\nlearning from residents and and faculty\nthat are practicing the specialty but\nyou know prior to actually starting your\ntraining you you never experience\nanything like being a resident in\nneurosurgery uh the stress and the\nvolume of patients that you have to take\ncare of and the long nights it can be\nquite Lonely by the way\num you develop friends in the hospital\nbut sometimes you're on your own when\nyou're on call and you have backup you\ncan call your chief resident or you're\nattending but you really have to learn\nhow to take care of patients yourself\nyou obviously form teams with nurses and\nstaff and things like that and other\nresidents but it can be lonely it can be\nreally challenging and I think because\nof those experiences that all\nneurosurgeons go through uh\nyou know we tend to have this sort of\nunflappable personality that perhaps we\nstarted with a bit compared to the\naverage person but the training\ndefinitely amplifies it and do you have\ntools that you implement if you ever\nfeel that you're getting slightly\noff-center\nI do now\num\nyou know I\nwhen I was in training I actually\nremember in my\nsecond year so most neurosurgery\nprograms when you're a junior resident\nin some ways that's your toughest year\nnot in every way\num\nit is your toughest year because you're\nyou're young and you're inexperienced\nand you don't know what you don't know\nand and that that's why it's such a\ntough year because you have to learn a\nlot very quickly for patient safety\nreasons for self-survival you know you\njust have to learn a lot\num and you're on call by yourself in the\nhospital and it's uh it's a real\nChallenge and I think that you know I\nyou know personally I I gained a lot of\nweight during that year the only\nexercise I did consciously was taking\nthe stairs I refused to take the\nelevator and I was at uh Penn at HUB\nwhere I currently practice now\nand I remember I would see patients\nanywhere from sort of the ground floor\nwhere the Chama Bay was or the ER all\nthe way up to Founders 12th 12th floor\nand I would never take an elevator that\nwas my rule for the year because I knew\nI would not have time to exercise but I\nwould just take the stairs and in the\nbeginning of the year I would be a\nlittle winded when I got to the 12th\nfloor but by the end of the year\nactually it didn't really phase me it\nbecame a great Habit to have\num the problem with that though is I\npaired that unfortunately with you know\na lot of sleepless nights or not enough\nsleep let's say\nand I had this terrible habit of\ndrinking coffee late at night and I\nwould put a lot of sugar in it and it\nwas sort of the only way for me to get a\nquick you know um a quick bout of energy\nthat for some reason I prioritized at\nthat time obviously knowing that I would\ncrash which I always did and I always\nkind of regretted it but I still did it\nanyway and I I attribute that to poor\ndecision making inexperience\num and perhaps being a little vulnerable\nlike I think we all are that's why I\nrelate with a lot of the research that I\ndo and I remember I got married in my\nthird year the year after my second year\nand my wife and I or my fiance at the\ntime we started going to the gym\ntogether in the morning and my hours\nwere a little better so I would actually\nbe able to exercise before I operated\nthat day and I operated almost every day\nas a third year resident so I remember\nI'd get to the gym really early in three\nmonths I lost like 20 pounds and I\nwasn't trying to lose weight I just was\nsleeping better and taking care of\nmyself and I remember when we got\nmarried I I you know I fit into a tuxedo\nthat I had in college or it would have\nfit me in college it actually was a new\ntuxedo admittedly but it was the same\nsize as my tuxedo from college so I I\nthink that um I've always related with\nthe problems that our our patients have\nto a certain extent and you know I when\nI've been most vulnerable which is what\nI was working the hardest with the least\namount of sleep I I related with it the\nmost and\nyes exercise for me has always been my\ntool\num more recently exercise some some you\nknow strength training I think is\nimportant compared with cardio\num I don't do enough of either\num but I definitely do some and that\nhelps meditation helps me a bit we I do\nthat every night before I go to sleep\num\nyou know I I use an app for it it's\nprobably not the best way to do\nmeditation but if it keeps you doing it\nregularly that's the best way to do it\nAndrew I couldn't agree with you more\nyou know it's one of those things where\nI look forward to it every night and you\nknow sometimes my wife falls asleep and\nI come to bed a little later and I\nwhisper I'm like are you okay if I turn\nthe app on so you know she does the same\nto me because I think we both value it\nand I think that's that that's been very\nhelpful I didn't have that tool probably\nwhat I needed it most but I have it now\nand it's very helpful\nI really appreciate you sharing those\ntools a number of people uh I'm guessing\nout there might want to become\nneurosurgeons I really believe that in\nhearing today's conversation that you\nwill spark an interest in medicine and\nor neurosurgery\num well certainly you need to be a a\nphysician before you can become a\nneurosurgeon so end neurosurgery in some\ncases and that would be beautiful and I\npredict that will be happen that will\nhappen excuse me as a consequence of\num what you've shared today I really\nappreciate your mentioning of the um\nemphasis and appreciation on quality\ntime uh I very much see this

that\nyou're doing is really out there on that\ncutting I don't want to say bleeding\nedge because in this context it's not\ngoing to sound right but on that extreme\nCutting Edge of what we
