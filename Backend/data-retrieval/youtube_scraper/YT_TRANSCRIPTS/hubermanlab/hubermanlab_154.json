    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. David Anderson,\nDr. Anderson is a professor of biology\nat the California Institute of Technology,\noften commonly referred\nto as Caltech University.\nDr. Anderson's research\nfocuses on emotions\nand states of mind and body,\nand indeed he emphasizes how emotions,\nlike happiness, sadness, anger and so on,\nare actually subcategories\nof what are generally governed by states,\nthat is, things that are occurring\nin the nervous system in our brain\nand in the connections\nbetween brain and body\nthat dictate whether or not\nwe feel good about how we are feeling,\nand that drive our behaviors,\nthat is, bias us to be\nin action or inaction\nand strongly influence\nthe way we interpret\nour experience and our surroundings.\nToday, Dr. Anderson\nteaches us, for instance,\nwhy people become aggressive\nand why that aggression can\nsometimes take the form of rage.\nWe also talk about sexual behavior,\nand the boundaries and overlap\nbetween aggression and sexual behavior.\nAnd that discussion about\naggression and sexual behavior\nalso starts to focus on particular aspects\nof neural circuits and\nstates of mind and body\nthat govern things like, for instance,\nmale-male aggression,\nversus male-female aggression,\nversus female-female aggression.\nSo today, you will learn a lot\nabout the biological mechanisms\nthat govern why we feel the way we feel.\nIndeed, Dr. Anderson is an author\nof a terrific new popular book,\nentitled \"The Nature of the\nBeast: How Emotions Guide Us\".\nI've read this book several times now,\nI can tell you it contains so many gems\nthat are firmly grounded\nin the scientific research.\nIn fact, a lot of what's in the book\ncontrasts with many of the common myths\nabout emotions and biology.\nSo whether or not you're a therapist,\nor you're a biologist,\nor you're simply just somebody interested\nin why we feel the way we feel\nand why we act the way we act,\nI cannot recommend the book highly enough.\nAgain, the title is\n\"The Nature of the Beast:\nHow Emotions Guide Us\".\nToday's discussion also\nventures into topics\nsuch as mental health and mental illness,\nand some of the exciting discoveries\nthat have been made by\nDr. Anderson's laboratory\nand other laboratories\nidentifying specific peptides,\nthat is, small proteins\nthat can govern whether or not people\nfeel anxious or less anxious,\naggressive or less aggressive.\nThis is an important area of research\nthat has direct implications\nfor much of what we\nread about in the news,\nboth unfortunate and fortunate events,\nand that will no doubt drive the future\nof mental health treatments.\nDr. Anderson is considered\none of the most pioneering\nand important researchers\nin neurobiology of our time.\nIndeed, he is a member of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nand a Howard Hughes Medical\nInstitute investigator.\nI've mentioned the HHMI\nonce or twice before\nwhen we've had other HHMI\nguests on this podcast,\nbut for those of you\nthat are not familiar,\nthe Howard Hughes Medical Institute\nfunds a small number of investigators\ndoing particularly\nhigh-risk, high-benefit work,\nand it is an extremely competitive process\nto identify those Howard\nHughes investigators.\nThey are essentially appointed,\nand then every five years,\nthey have to compete against one another\nand against a new incoming flock\nof would-be HHMI investigators\nto get another five years of funding.\nThey are literally given\na grade every five years\nas to whether or not they\ncan continue, not continue,\nor whether or not they should worry\nabout being funded for an\nextended period of time.\nDr. Anderson has been an investigator\nwith the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute since 1989.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all, they ship internationally,\nbecause we know that\nmany of you are located\noutside of the United States.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none,\nboth in terms of purity\nand precision of the\namounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single-ingredient supplements,\nand that are supplied in dosages\nthat allow you to build a\nsupplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add things\nand remove things from your protocol\nin a way that's really\nsystematic and scientific.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partner with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere, you'll see those supplements,\nand just keep in mind that\nwe are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Levels,\nLevels is a program that lets you see\nhow different foods affect your health\nby giving you real-time\nfeedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\nOne of the most important factors\ngoverning our immediate\nand long-term health\nand indeed our ability to\nthink and focus clearly\nis our blood glucose levels,\nalso referred to as blood sugar.\nTo maintain healthy energy\nand focus throughout the day,\nyou want to keep your\nblood glucose levels steady\nand avoid peaks and crashes.\nI first started using\nLevels about a year ago\nas a way to better understand\nhow specific foods,\nfood combinations,\nexercise and supplements\nimpact my blood glucose levels,\nand it's been tremendously informative.\nIn fact, it's changed and shaped\nthe way that I organize my entire day.\nLevels even provides a simple score\nafter you eat a meal\nso you can see how\ndifferent foods affect you\nand develop a personalized\nnutrition program\nthat's ideal for you.\nSo if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\nyou can go to levels.link/huberman,\nthat's levels.link/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThey also have some\nreally unique features,\nbecause they are customized\nto your unique sleep needs.\nI've talked over and over\nagain on this podcast\nand on other podcasts\nabout the fact that sleep\nis the foundation of mental health,\nphysical health and performance,\nthere's just simply no other substitute\nfor a quality night's\nsleep on a regular basis.\nI've been sleeping on a Helix mattress\nfor well over a year now\nand it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had,\nand that's in large part\nbecause the mattress was designed for me.\nWhat you need to know, however,\nis what's the ideal mattress for you,\nand you can do that by\ngoing to Helix's site,\nyou can take their brief quiz,\nwhich will ask you, \"Do\nyou sleep on your side,\nyour back, your stomach?\nOr maybe you don't know,\nor maybe all three.\nDo you tend to run hot\nor cold in the night?\nMaybe you know, maybe you don't.\"\nAt the end of that short quiz,\nthey will match you to the\nideal mattress for you.\nI matched to the Dusk,\nthe D-U-S-K mattress,\nbut again, that's what I need,\nthat's not necessarily what you need\nin order to get your best night's sleep.\nBut if you're interested\nin upgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two-minute sleep quiz\nand they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you\nand you'll get up to $200\noff any mattress order\nand two free pillows,\nthey have terrific pillows.\nAnd you get to try out that mattress\nfor 100 nights risk free.\nThey'll even pick it up for\nyou if you don't love it,\nbut I'm certain you will.\nAgain, if you're interested in it,\nyou go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off your mattress order\nand two free pillows.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you don't, meaning no sugar,\nbut it has sodium, magnesium and potassium\nin the proper ratios.\nSodium, magnesium and potassium\nare critical for the\nfunctioning of all your cells,\nbut of your neurons, your\nnerve cells in particular.\nMany people out there, believe it or not,\nneed to ingest more\nsodium and more potassium,\nand magnesium in the proper ratios\nto sodium and potassium.\nFor those of you that are\nprehypertensive or hypertensive,\nyou definitely don't want to\ncrank up your sodium intake,\nbut many people out there,\nespecially people following low-carb diets\nor eating exceptionally clean\nvery well may need more sodium.\nAnd by drinking LMNT mixed with water,\nwhich is what I do once or twice a day,\nand certainly also during\nworkouts and after workouts,\nyou can optimize mental functioning\nand physical performance\nby increasing your electrolyte\nbalance in the proper ratios.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's L-M-N-T, .com/huberman,\nand you'll get a free\nsample pack with your order.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto get a free sample pack with your order.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. David Anderson.\nDavid, great to be here\nand great to finally sit\ndown and chat with you.\n- Great to be here too, thank you so much.\n- Yeah, I have a ton of questions,\nbut I want to start with\nsomething fairly basic,\nbut that I'm aware is a\npretty vast landscape,\nand that's the difference\nbetween emotions and states,\nif indeed there is a difference,\nand how we should think about emotions.\nWhat are they?\nThey have all these names,\nhappiness, sadness,\ndepression, anger, rage,\nhow should we think about them\nand why might states be\nat least as useful a thing to think about,\nif not more useful?\n- That's great.\nFirst, the short answer to your question\nis that I see emotions as\na type of internal state,\nin the sense that arousal's\nalso a type of internal state,\nmotivation's a type of internal state,\nsleep is a type of internal state.\nAnd the sort of simplest way\nI think of internal states is that,\nas you've shown in your own work,\nthey change the input-to-output\ntransformation of the brain.\nWhen you're asleep, you\ndon't hear something\nthat you would hear if you were awake,\nunless it's a really, really loud noise.\nSo from that broad perspective,\nI see emotion as a class of state\nthat controls behavior.\nThe reason I think it's useful\nto think about it as a state\nis it puts the focus on it\nas a neurobiological process\nrather than as a psychological process.\nAnd this gets around all of\nthe definitional problems\nthat people have with the word emotion,\nwhere many people equate\nemotion with feeling,\nwhich is a subjective sense\nthat we can only study in humans,\nbecause to find out\nwhat someone's feeling,\nyou have to ask them,\nand people are the only\nanimals that can talk,\nthat we can understand.\nSo that's how I think about emotion,\nif you think of an iceberg,\nit's the part of the iceberg\nthat's below the surface of the water,\nthe feeling part is the tip\nthat's sort of floating above\nthe surface of your consciousness.\nNot that that isn't important, it is,\nbut you have to understand consciousness\nif you want to understand feelings,\nand we're not ready to\nstudy that in animals yet,\nand so that's how I think about it.\n- What are the different\ncomponents of a state?\nYou mentioned arousal as a key component,\nwhat are some of the\nother features of states\nthat represent this, as you so\nbeautifully put in your book,\nthat represent below the tip\nof the iceberg?\n- Right, right.\nSo you can break states\nup into different facets,\nor people would call them dimensions,\nand so there have been people\nwho have thought of emotions\nas having just really two dimensions,\nan arousal dimension, how intense is it?\nAnd also a valence dimension,\nwhich is, is it positive\nor negative, good or bad?\nRalph Adolphs and I have tried\nto expand that a little bit\nto think about components of emotion,\nparticularly those that\ndistinguish emotion states\nfrom motivational states,\nbecause they are very closely related.\nOne of those important\nproperties is persistence,\nand this is something that distinguishes\nstate-driven behaviors\nfrom simple reflexes.\nReflexes tend to terminate\nwhen the stimulus turns off,\nlike the doctor hitting\nyour knee with a hammer,\nit initiates with the stimulus onset\nand it terminates with\nthe stimulus offset,\nemotions tend to outlast, often,\nthe stimulus that evoke them.\nIf you're walking along a trail\nhere in Southern California,\nyou hear a rattlesnake rattling,\nyou're going to jump in the air,\nbut your heart is going\nto continue to beat\nand your palms sweat and\nyour mouth is going to be dry\nfor a while after it's\nslithered off in the bush,\nand you're going to be hypervigilant,\nif you see something\nthat even remotely looks\nsnake-like, a stick,\nyou're going to stop and jump.\nSo persistence is an important\nfeature of emotion states,\nnot all states have persistence.\nSo for example, you think about hunger.\nOnce you've eaten, the state is gone,\nyou're not hungry anymore,\nbut if you are really angry\nand you get into a fight with somebody,\neven after the fight is over,\nyou may remain riled up for a long time\nand it takes you a while to calm down,\nand that may have to do\nwith the arousal dimension\nor some other part of it.\nAnd then generalization\nis an important component of\nemotion states that make them,\nif they have been\ntriggered in one situation,\nthey can apply to another situation.\nAnd my favorite example of that is,\nyou come home from work\nand your kid is screaming,\nif you had a good day at work,\nyou might pick it up and sooth it,\nand if you had a bad day at work,\nyou might react very differently\nto it and scream at it.\nAnd so that's a generalization\nof the state that was triggered at work,\nby something your boss said to you,\nto a completely different interaction.\nAnd again, that's something\nthat distinguishes\nemotion states from motivation states,\nmotivation states are really specific,\nfind and eat food,\nobtain and consume water,\nand they're involved in\nhomeostatic maintenance.\nSo states are very multifaceted,\nand just asking questions\nabout how these components\nof states are encoded,\nlike what makes a state persist?\nWhat gives a state a positive\nor a negative valance?\nHow do you crank up or crank down\nthe intensity of the state?\nIt just opens up a\nwhole bunch of questions\nthat you can ask in the brain\nwith the kinds of tools we have now.\n- You mentioned arousal a few times,\nand you mentioned valence,\nrealizing that there are\nthese other aspects of states,\nI'd like to just talk about\narousal a little bit more, and valence,\nbecause at a very basic level,\nit seems to me that arousal,\nwe can be very alert and pissed off,\nstressed, worried, we can have insomnia,\nwe can also be very\nalert and be quite happy.\nSo the valence flips, people\ncan be sexually aroused,\npeople can be aroused\nin all sorts of ways.\nIs there any simple or simple-ish\nneurochemical signature\nthat can flip valence?\nSo for instance, is there any\nway that we can safely say\nthat arousal with some\nadditional dopamine release\nis going to be of positive valence,\nand arousal with very low dopamine\nis going to be of negative valence?\n- I would be reluctant to say\nthat it's a chemical flip,\nI would say it's more likely to be\na circuit flip.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Different circuits being engaged.\nAnd it might be that a given\nneurochemical, even dopamine,\nis involved in both\npositively valanced arousal\nand negatively valanced arousal,\nthat's why people think about\nthese as different axes.\nSo I think the interesting\nquestion that you touch on is,\nis arousal something that\nis just completely generic\nin the brain,\nor are there actually\ndifferent kinds of arousal\nthat are specific to different behaviors?\nAnd you raise the question,\nsexual arousal feels different\nfrom aggressive arousal, for example,\nand we actually published a paper on this,\nback in 2009, in fruit flies,\nwhere we found some evidence\nfor two types of arousal states.\nOne of which is sleep-wake arousal,\nyou're more aroused when you wake up\nthan when you're asleep,\nand flies show that,\nand the other is a startle response,\nan arousal response to\na mechanical stimulus,\nand not just mechanical stimulus.\nIf you puff air on flies,\nkind of like trying to swat the wasp away\nfrom your burger at a picnic table,\nthey come back more and\nmore and more vigorously.\nAnd we were able to dissect this\nand show that although both\nof those forms of arousal\nrequired dopamine, they were exerted\nthrough completely separable\nneural circuits in the fly.\nAnd so that really put, number one,\nthe emphasis on it's the circuit\nthat determines the type of arousal,\nbut also that arousal isn't unitary,\nthat there are behavior-specific\nforms of arousal.\nAnd I think the jury is still out\nas to whether there is such a thing\nas completely generalized arousal or not.\nAnd I think some people\nwould argue there is,\nbut I think more attention needs\nto be paid to this question\nof domain-specific or\nbehavior-specific forms of arousal.\n- Yeah, it's a super-interesting idea,\n'cause I always thought of\narousal as along a continuum,\nlike you can either be in a panic attack\nat the one end of the extreme,\nor you can be in a coma,\nand then somewhere in the\nmiddle, you're alert and calm,\nbut then this issue of\nvalence really, as you say,\npresents this opportunity\nthat really there might be\nmultiple circuits for arousal.\n- Yeah.\n- Or multiple mechanisms\nthat would include\nneurochemicals, as well as\ndifferent neural pathways.\n- Yeah.\n- So like to talk a bit about a state,\nif it is indeed a state,\nwhich is aggression,\nyour labs worked extensively on this.\nAnd if you would, could you highlight\nsome of the key findings there,\nwhich brain areas that are involved?\nThe beautiful work of Dayu\nLin and others in your lab\nthat point to the idea\nthat indeed there are kind\nof switches in the brain,\nbut that thinking of\nswitches for aggression\nmight be too simple,\nhow should we think about aggression?\nAnd I'll just sort of skew the question\na bit more by saying,\nwe see lots of different\nkinds of aggression,\nthis terrible school shooting\ndown in Texas recently,\nclearly an act that included aggression,\nand yet, you could imagine\nthat's a very different type of aggression\nthan an all-out rage or\na controlled aggression,\nthere's a lot of variation there.\nSo what are your thoughts on aggression,\nhow it's generated, the\nneural circuit mechanisms\nand some of the variation\nin what we call aggression?\n- Yeah, this is a great question,\nand it's a large area.\nI would say that, first of all,\nthe word aggression, in my mind,\nrefers more to a description of behavior\nthan it does to an internal state.\nAggression could reflect an internal state\nthat we would call anger in humans,\nor could reflect fear,\nor it could reflect hunger\nif it's predatory aggression.\nAnd so this gets at the\nissue that you raised\nof the different types\nof aggression that exist.\nThe work that Dayu did\nwhen she was in my lab\nthat really broke open the field\nto the application of modern genetic tools\nfor studying circuits in mice\nis that she found a way to\nevoke aggression in mice\nusing optogenetics to\nactivate specific neurons\nin a region of the hypothalamus,\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH,\nwhich people had been studying\nand looking at for decades,\nfollowing, first, the work of,\nin cats, the famous\nNobel Prize-winning work\nof Walter Hess,\nand then followed by work\ndone by Menno Kruk, in\nthe Netherlands, in rats,\nwhere they would stick\nelectrical wires into the brain\nand send electric currents into the brain,\nand they could trigger a placid cat\nto suddenly bare its teeth, hiss\nand almost strike out at the experimenter,\nand they could trigger rats\nto fight with each other.\nAnd even in Hess's original experiments,\nhe describes two types of aggression\nthat he evokes from cats\ndepending on where in the hypothalamus\nhe puts his electrode,\none of which he calls defensive rage,\nthat's the ears laid back,\nteeth bared and hissing.\nAnd the other one is predatory aggression,\nwhere the cat has its ears forward,\nand it's batting with its\npaw at a mouse-like object,\nlike it wants to catch it and eat it.\nSo he already had, at that stage,\nsome information about\nsegregation in the brain\nof different forms of aggression.\nSo fast forward to 2008, 2009,\nwhen Dayu came to the lab\nand we had started working\non aggression in fruit flies,\nand I wanted to bring it into mice\nso that we could apply genetic tools.\nAnd we started by having Dayu,\nwho was an electrophysiologist,\njust repeat the electrical stimulation\nof the ventromedial\nhypothalamus in the mouse,\njust like people had done in rats,\nin cats, in hamsters, even in monkeys.\nAnd she could not get\nthat experiment to work\nover 40 different trials,\nit just didn't work.\nWhat she got instead was fear behaviors,\nshe got freezing, cornering and crouching.\nAnd finally, in desperation,\nand we got a lot of input\nfrom Menno Kruk on this,\nhe really was mystified,\n\"Why doesn't it work in mice?\"\nWe realized why there had been no paper\non brain-stimulated aggression\nin mice in 50 years,\n'cause the experiment doesn't work.\nAnd the one bit of\ncredit I can claim there\nis I convinced Dayu to try optogenetics,\nbecause it just had sort of\ncome into use deep in the brain,\nfrom Karl Deisseroth and others' work.\nAnd I thought maybe because it could be\ndirected more specifically\nto a region of the brain\nand types of cells than\nelectrical stimulation,\nit might work.\nAnd Dayu said, \"Never,\nnever going to work.\nIf it doesn't work with electricity,\nwhy should it work with optogenetics?\"\nAnd the fact is that it did work,\nand we were able to trigger\naggression in this region\nusing optogenetic stimulation\nof ventromedial hypothalamus.\nAnd in retrospect, I think the reason\nthat we were seeing all\nthese fear behaviors\nis because right at the upper part,\nif you think of ventromedial hypothalamus\nlike a pear sitting on the ground,\nthe fat part of the pear near the ground\nis where the aggression neurons are,\nbut the upper part of the\npear has fear neurons.\nAnd it could be because\nit's so small in a mouse,\nwhen you inject electrical\ncurrent anywhere in the pear,\nit flows up through the entire pear\nand it activates the fear circuits,\nand those totally dominate aggression.\nAnd so that's why we\nwere never able to see\nany fighting with electrical stimulation,\nwhereas when you use optogenetics,\nyou confine the stimulation\njust to the region\nwhere you've implanted\nthe channelrhodopsin gene\ninto those neurons.\nAnd so fast forward from that,\nfrom a lot of work from\nDayu now on her own at NYU,\nand with her postdoc, Annegret Falkner,\nas well as work of other people,\nthere's evidence that the type of fighting\nthat we elicit when we stimulate VMH\nis offensive aggression\nthat is actually rewarding to male mice.\n- They like it.\n- They like it,\nmale mice will learn to poke their nose\nor press a bar to get the opportunity\nto beat up a subordinate male mouse.\nAnd in more recent experiments,\nif you activate those neurons\nand the mouse has a chance to be\nin one of two compartments in a box,\nthey will gravitate\ntowards the compartment\nwhere those neurons are activated,\nit has a positive valance.\nAnd when I went into this field\nand I was thinking, \"Well,\nwhat goes on in my brain\nand my body when I'm furious?\"\nit certainly doesn't feel\nlike a rewarding experience,\nit's not something that\nI would want to repeat\nbecause it feels good\nwhen I'm in that state,\nit doesn't feel good at\nall when I'm in that state.\nAnd it is still, I think, a mystery\nas to where that type of aggression,\nwhich is more defensive aggression,\nthe kind of aggression you\nfeel if you're being attacked\nor if you've been cheated by somebody,\nwhere that is encoded in the\nbrain and how that works,\nstill, I think, is a\nvery important mystery\nthat we haven't solved.\nAnd predatory aggression there\nhas been some progress on,\nso mice show predatory aggression,\nthey use that to catch\ncrickets that they eat,\nand that involves different circuits\nthan the ventromedial\nhypothalamic circuits.\nSo it's become clear that,\nif you want to call it\nthe state of aggressiveness,\nis multifaceted,\nit depends on the type of aggression\nand it involves different\nsorts of circuits.\nThere's a paper suggesting\nthat there might be a final common pathway\nfor all aggression in a region,\nwhich is one of my favorites,\nit's called the substantia innominata,\nthe substance with no name, I like.\n- Anatomists are so creative.\n- Yes.\n[Andrew laughing]\nOr the nucleus ambiguous,\nor the zona incerta, these are places\nthat no one can think of what they are.\nAnyhow, that might be\na final common pathway\nfor predatory aggression,\nand offensive and defensive aggression,\nbut it can be really hard to tell\njust from looking at a mouse fight\nwhether it's engaged in offensive\nor defensive aggression.\nWe've tried to take that apart\nusing machine learning\nanalysis of behavior,\nbut in rats, for example,\nit's much clearer when the animal\nis engaged in offensive\nversus defensive aggression.\nThey direct their bites\nat different parts of the opponent's body.\n- [Andrew] In particular.\n- Offensive aggression is flank directed,\ndefensive aggression goes for the neck,\ngoes for the throat.\n- Mm,\nI've seen some nature specials\nwhere in a very barbaric way,\n[laughing] at least to me, it seems,\nlike hyenas will try and go\nafter the reproductive axis,\nthey'll go after testicles and penis\nand they basically want to,\nit seems they want to limit\nfuture breeding potential.\n- Yes, or create pain.\n[David laughing]\n- Right, or create pain,\nor both.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, I mean, in terms\nof offensive aggression\nand your reflection that\nit doesn't feel good,\nI mean, I can say, I know some people\nwho really enjoy fighting.\n- [David] Hmm.\n- I have a relative who's a lawyer,\nhe loves to argue and fight.\n- [David] Huh.\n- I don't think of him\nas physically aggressive,\nin fact, he's not,\nbut loves to fight and loves to prosecute\nand go after people.\n- Hmm.\n- And he's pretty effective at it.\n- Right.\n- I have a friend,\nformer military special operations,\nand very calm guy, had a great career\nin military special operations,\nand he'll quite plainly\nsay, \"I love to fight.\"\n- Mm-hmm.\n- \"It's one my great joys.\"\nHe really enjoyed his work.\n- [David] Yep.\n- And also respected the other side\nbecause they offered the\nopportunity to test that\nand to experience that joy.\nSo in a kind of bizarre\nway to somebody like me,\nwho I'll certainly defend\nmy stance if I need to.\n- Yeah.\n- But I certainly\ndon't consider myself somebody\nwho offensively goes after\npeople just to go after them,\nthere's no, quote-unquote,\ndopamine hit here.\n- Right.\n- Acknowledging that dopamine\ndoes many things, of course.\n- Yeah.\n- I have couple of questions\nabout the way you describe the circuitry,\nI should say, the way the\ncircuitry is arranged.\n- [David] Mm-hmm.\n- And of course, we don't know,\nbecause we weren't consulted\nat the design phase.\n[David laughing]\nBut why do you think\nthere would be such a close\npositioning of neurons\nthat can elicit such divergent\nstates and behaviors?\nI mean, you're talking about\nthis pear-shaped structure,\nwhere the neurons that generate fear\nare cheek to jowl with the neurons\nthat generate offensive\naggression of all things.\nIt's like putting the neurons\nthat control swallowing\nnext to the neurons that control vomiting,\n[laughing] it just seems to me that,\non the one hand, this is the way\nthat neural circuits are often arranged,\nand yet, to me, it's\nalways been perplexing\nas to why this would be the case.\n- Yeah, I think that is\na very profound question,\nand I've wondered about that a lot.\nIf you think from an\nevolutionary perspective,\nit might have been the case\nthat defensive behaviors and fear\narose before offensive aggression,\nbecause animals, first and foremost,\nhave to defend themselves from\npredation by other animals.\nAnd maybe it's only\nwhen they're comfortable\nwith having warded off predation\nand made themselves safe,\nthat they can start to think about,\n\"Who's going to be the alpha\nmale in my group here?\"\nAnd so it could be that if\nyou think that brain regions\nand cell populations evolve by duplication\nand modification of\npreexisting cell populations,\nthat might be the way that those regions\nwound up next to each other.\nAnd developmentally, they start out\nfrom a common pool of precursors\nthat expresses the same gene,\nthe fear neurons and\nthe aggression neurons,\nand then with development,\nit gets shut off in the aggression neurons\nand maintained in the fear neurons.\nNow, that view says, \"Oh, it's an accident\nof evolution and development,\"\nbut I think there must be\na functional part as well.\nSo one thing we know\nabout offensive aggression\nis that strong fear shuts it down,\nwhereas defensive\naggression, at least in rats,\nis actually enhanced by fear.\nIt's one of the big differences\nbetween defensive aggression\nand offensive aggression.\nAnd if you think about it,\nif offensive aggression is\nrewarding and pleasurable,\nif you start to get really scared,\nthat tends to take the fun out of it,\nand maybe these two regions\nare close to each other\nto facilitate inhibition of\naggression by the fear neurons.\nWe know for a fact that if\nwe deliberately stimulate\nthose fear neurons at the top of the pear,\nwhen two animals are involved in a fight,\nit just stops the fight dead in its tracks\nand they go off into\nthe corner and freeze.\nSo at least hierarchically,\nit seems like fear\nis the dominant behavior\nover offensive aggression,\nand how that inhibition\nwould work is not clear,\n'cause all these neurons\nare pretty much excitatory,\nthey're almost all glutamatergic.\nAnd so one of the interesting\nquestions for the future is,\nhow exactly does fear dominate over\nand shut down offensive\naggression in the brain?\nHow does that work, is it all circuitry,\nare there chemicals involved?\nWhat's the mechanism and\nwhen is it called into play?\nBut I think that's the way\nI tend to think about why these neurons\nare all mixed up together.\nAnd it's not just fight and freezing,\nor fight and flight,\nthere are also metabolic\nneurons that are mixed together\nin VMH as well.\n- Mm-hmm.\nControlling body-wide metabolism?\n- Yeah.\n- Very interesting.\n- There are neurons there\nthat respond to glucose,\nwhen glucose goes up in your\nbloodstream, they're activated,\nand VMH has a whole history\nin the field of obesity,\nbecause if you destroy it\nin a rat, you get a fat rat.\nSo the way most of the\nworld thinks about VMH\nis they think about, \"Oh, that's the thing\nthat keeps you from getting fat.\"\nIt's the anti-obesity area,\nbut in the area of social behavior,\nwe see it as a center\nfor control of aggression\nand fear behaviors.\nAnd again, why these\nneurons and these functions,\nI like to call them the four Fs,\nfeeding, freezing, fighting and mating.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- That they all seem to be\nclosely intermingled with each other,\nmaybe because crosstalk between them\nis very important to\nhelp the animal's brain\ndecide what behavior to prioritize\nand what behavior to shut\ndown at any given moment.\n- One of the things that we will do\nis link to the incredible\nvideos of these mice\nthat have selective stimulation\nof neurons in the VMH,\nDayu's and the other\nstudies that you've done.\nWhenever I teach, I show\nthose videos at some point,\nwith the caveats and\nwarnings that are required\nwhen one is about to\nsee a video of a mouse\ntrying to mate with another mouse,\nor mating with another mouse,\nand they seem both to be quite happy\nabout the mating experience,\nat least as far as we\nknow, as observers of mice.\nAnd then upon stimulation\nof those VMH neurons,\none of the mice essentially\ntries to kill the other mouse.\nAnd then when that stimulation is stopped,\nthey basically go back to hanging out.\nThey don't go right back to mating.\n- Right.\n- There's some reconciliation\nclearly that needs to\n[laughing] happen first,\nwe assume.\n- Yes.\n- But it's just so striking,\nand I think equally striking is the video\nwhere the mouse is alone\nin there with the glove,\nthe VMH neurons are stimulated\nand the mouse goes into a rage,\nit looks like it wants to kill\nthe glove, basically.\n- Yep.\n- So striking, I encourage\npeople to go watch those,\nbecause it really puts a\ntremendous amount of color\non what we're describing,\nand it's just the idea that\nthere are switches in the brain,\nto me, really became\nclear upon seeing that.\nOne of the, excuse me, one of the concepts\nthat you've raised in your lectures before\nand that I think was Hess's idea\nis this idea of a sort\nof hydraulic pressure.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Or maybe it was Konrad,\nI can't speak now.\n[David laughing]\nExcuse me, Konrad Lorenz,\npardon.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Who talked about a kind\nof hydraulic pressure\ntowards behavior.\nI'm fascinated by this\nidea of hydraulic pressure,\nbecause I don't consider\nmyself a hot-tempered person,\nbut I am familiar with the fact\nthat when I lose my temper,\nit takes quite a while\nfor me to simmer down.\nI can't think about anything else,\nI don't want to think about anything else.\nIn fact, trying to think\nabout anything else\nbecomes aversive to me,\nwhich, to me, underscores\nthis notion of prioritization\nof the different states.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- And potentially conflicting states.\nWhat do you think funnels into this idea\nof hydraulic pressure toward a state?\nAnd why is it, perhaps, that\nsometimes we can be very angry,\nand if we succeed in winning an argument,\nall of a sudden, it will subside?\nBecause clearly that means\nthat there are external influences,\nit's a complex space\nhere that we're creating,\nI realize I'm creating\na bit of a cloud.\n- Yeah.\n- And I'm doing it on\npurpose, because, to me,\nthe idea of a hydraulic\npressure towards a state,\nlike sleep, there's a sleep pressure.\n- Yeah.\n- There is a pressure\ntowards aggression, that all makes sense,\nbut what's involved?\nIs it too multifactorial\nto actually separate out the variables,\nbut what's really driving\nhydraulic pressure\ntoward a given state?\n- Yeah, so really important question,\nI think one way that is\nhelpful, at least for me,\nto break this question\napart and think about it\nis to distinguish homeostatic behaviors,\nthat is, need-based behaviors,\nwhere the pressure is\nbuilt up because of a need,\nlike, \"I'm hungry, I need to eat.\nI'm thirsty, I need to drink.\nI'm hot, I need to get to a cold place,\"\nit's basically the thermostat\nmodel of your brain.\nYou have a set point,\nand then if the temperature gets too hot,\nyou turn on the AC,\nand if the temperature gets too cold,\nyou turn on the heater\nand you put yourself\nback to the set point.\nI don't think that's how aggression works.\nThat is, it's not that we all go around,\nat least subjectively,\nI don't go around with an\naccumulating need to fight,\nwhich I then look for\nan excuse to release it.\nNow, maybe there are people that do that,\nand they go out and look for\nbar fights to get into to.\n- Or Twitter.\n- Yeah, [laughing] or Twitter,\nyeah.\n- Twitter seems to,\nI'm sort of half joking,\nbecause Twitter seems to draw\na reasonably sized crowd of people\nthat are there for combat of some sort,\neven though the total intellectual power\nof any of their comments\nis about that of a cap gun.\n[David laughing]\nThey seem to really like\nto fire off that cap gun.\n- Right, right.\n- But I agree.\n- Yeah.\n- Before we continue\nwith today's discussion,\nI'd like to just briefly acknowledge\nour sponsor, Athletic\nGreens, now called AG1.\nAthletic Greens, aka AG1,\nis an all-in-one,\nvitamin-mineral probiotic drink\nthat also has adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since way back in 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still drink\nAthletic Greens twice a day\nis that it supplies total\nfoundational coverage\nof my vitamin-mineral needs\nand it supplies important nutrients\nthat I need to support my gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome, as many of you know,\nsupports the immune system,\nit also supports the\nso-called gut-brain access,\nwhich is vital for\nmood, for energy levels,\nfor regulating focus\nand many other features\nof our mental health\nand physical health that\nimpact our daily performance\nand high performance in any endeavors\nwe might be involved in.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away five free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 with every order.\nAnd of course, vitamin D3 K2\nare vital for all sorts of things,\nlike hormone health and metabolic health,\nand K2 for cardiovascular\nhealth and calcium regulation.\nAgain, you can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\n- So you can think of this\naccumulated hydraulic pressure\neither being based on something\nthat you were deprived of\ncreating an accumulating need,\nor something that you want to do\nbuilding up a drive or\na pressure to do that,\nand the natural way to think\nabout that, at least for me,\nis as gradual increases in neural activity\nin a particular region of the brain.\nAnd so for example, in the\narea of the hypothalamus\nthat controls feeding,\nScott Sternson and others have shown\nthat the hungrier you get,\nthe higher the level of activity\nin that region in the brain,\nand then when you eat, boom,\nthe activity goes right back down again.\nAnd that state is actually\nnegatively valenced,\nso it's like the animal, quote-unquote,\nfeels increasingly uncomfortable,\njust like we feel\nincreasingly uncomfortable\nthe hungrier we are,\nand then when we eat, it tamps it down,\nbut there is this increased activity.\nAnd I think in the case of aggression,\nour data and others show\nthat the more strongly you drive\nthis region of the brain optogenetically,\nthe more of just a hair trigger you need\nto set the animal off to get it to fight.\nNow, the interesting thing\nis that if there is nothing\nfor the animal to attack,\nit doesn't really do much\nwhen you're stimulating this region.\nIt sort of wanders around\nthe cage a little bit more,\nbut it will not actually show overt attack\nunless you put something in front of it.\nAnd the same thing is true for the areas\nwe've described that\ncontrol mating behavior.\nThis is what Lindsay is working on,\nyou can stimulate those areas\n'til you're blue in the face,\nand the mouse just sort of wanders around,\nbut if you put another mouse in,\nwham, he will try to mount that mouse,\nif you put a kumquat in the cage.\n[Andrew laughing]\nHe'll try to mount\nthe kumquat,\nand so it becomes a sort\nof any port in the storm.\nSo there is this idea that the drive\nis building up pressure\nthat somehow needs to be released\nwhere that pressure is\nactually being exerted,\nif you accept that it's increased activity\nin some circuit or circuits someplace,\nwhat is it pushing up against\nthat needs something else\nto sort of unplug it in\nthe Lorenz hydraulic model?\nThat is, you don't see the behavior\nuntil you release a valve on this bucket\nand let the accumulated pressure flow out.\nAnd that's one of the\nthings we're trying to study\nin the context of the\nmating behavior as well,\nhow does the information\nthat there's an object in front of you\ncome together with this drive state\nthat is generated by stimulating\nthese neurons in the hypothalamus to say,\n\"Okay, pull the trigger and go,\nit's time to mate, it's time to attack?\"\nAnd we're just starting to get\nsome insights into that now.\n- Fascinating, and I\nshould mention to people,\nDr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,\nLindsay is a former\ngraduate student of mine\nthat's now a postdoc in David's lab.\nAnd I haven't caught up with her recently\nto hear about these experiments,\nbut they sound fascinating.\nI would love to spend\nsome time on this issue\nof why is it that a mouse\nwon't attack nothing,\nbut it'll attack even a glove,\nand why it will only try and mate\nif there's another mouse to mate with?\nIt's actually, I think,\nfortunately for you,\nyou're not spending a lot of time\non Twitter and Instagram or YouTube,\nbut there's this whole online\ncommunity that exists now,\nas far as I know, it's almost\nexclusively young males\nwho are obsessed with this idea,\nI'll just say it, it has\na name, it's called NoFap,\nof no masturbation as a way\nto maintain their motivation\nto go out and actually seek mates.\nBecause of the ready availability\nof online pornography.\n- Huh.\n- There's probably\na much larger population of young males\nthat are never actually\ngoing out and seeking mates\nbecause they're getting\nporn addicted, et cetera.\nThere's actually a serious issue\nthat came up in our episode\nwith Anna Lembke, who wrote the book\n\"Dopamine Nation\".\n- Hmm.\n- Because of the\navailability of pornography,\nthere's a whole social context\nthat's being created around\nthis, and genuine addiction.\nSo humans are not like the mice,\nor mice are not like the humans,\nhumans seem to resolve\nthe issue on their own.\n- Yeah.\n- In ways that might actually\nimpede seeking and\nfinding of sexual partners\nand/or long-term mates.\n- Right.\n- So serious issue there,\nI raise it as a serious issue.\n- Yep.\n- That I hear a lot about,\n'cause I get asked hundreds\nif not thousands of questions about this,\n\"Is there any physiological basis\nfor what they call NoFap?\"\nAnd I never actually reply\n'cause there's no data.\n- [David] Yep.\n- But what you're raising here\nis a very interesting mechanistic scenario\nthat can, and as you\nmentioned, is being explored.\nSo what do we know about the\ninternal state of a mouse\nwhose VMH is being stimulated\nor a mouse whose other brain region\nthat can stimulate the desire to mate,\nwhat do we know about the\ninternal state of that mouse\nif it's just alone in the\ncage wandering around?\niI it wandering around\nreally wanting to mate\nand really wanting to fight?\nWe, of course, don't know,\nbut is its heart rate up,\nis its blood pressure up?\nIs it wishing that there was pornography?\n[David and Andrew laughing]\nSomething's going on, presumably,\nthat's different than\nprior to that stimulation,\nand is it arousal?\nAnd what do you think it is\nabout the visual factory\nperception of a conspecific\nthat ungates this tremendous\nrepertoire of behaviors?\n- Right, that is a central question.\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons\nthat sit on top of the aggression neurons,\nwe know that when those neurons\nare activated optogenetically,\nin the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons,\nthat there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring,\nyou can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\nThere is an increase\nin stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream,\nwe've shown that heart rate goes up.\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze,\nwhich is what those animals do,\nthere is autonomic arousal\nand neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\nAnd some of that is probably shared\nby the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons,\nalthough we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail,\nbut I wouldn't be surprised\nbecause they project to\nmany of the same regions\nthat the fear neurons project to,\nwhich is a interesting issue\nin the context to discuss later maybe,\nin the context of why we're comfortable\nwith mental illnesses that are based\non maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses\nthat are based on\nmaladaptations of aggression\nif they have pretty similar\ncircuits in the brain.\nBut that's how I would imagine\nthere is an arousal dimension, as you say,\nthere are stress hormones that\nare activated, these regions,\nVMH projects to about 30\ndifferent regions in the brain,\nand it gets input from\nabout 30 different regions.\nSo I kind of see it as both an antenna\nand a broadcasting center,\nit's like a satellite dish\nthat takes in information\nfrom different sensory modalities,\nsmell, maybe vision, mechanosensation,\nand then it sort of\nsynthesizes and integrates that\ninto a fairly low-dimensional,\nas the computational people call it,\nrepresentation of this pressure to attack,\nand it broadcasts that all over the brain\nto trigger all these systems\nthat have to be brought into play\nif the animal is going\nto engage in aggression.\nBecause aggression is a very risky thing\nfor an animal to engage in,\nit could wind up losing\nand it could wind up getting killed,\nand so its brain constantly has to make\na cost-benefit analysis of\nwhether to continue on that path\nor to back off as well.\nAnd I think that part of\nthis broadcasting function\nof this region is engaging\nall these other brain domains\nthat play a role in this kind\nof cost-benefit analysis.\n- I want to talk more\nabout mating behavior,\nbut as a segue to that,\nas we're talking about\naggression and mating behavior,\nI think, \"Hormones.\"\nAnd whenever there's an\nopportunity on this podcast\nto shatter a common myth, I grab it.\nOne of the common myths that's out there,\nand I think that persists,\nis that testosterone makes\nanimals and humans aggressive,\nand estrogen makes animals\nplacid and kind or emotional.\nAnd as we both know,\nnothing could be further from the truth,\nalthough there's some truth to the idea\nthat these hormones are all involved.\nRobert Sapolsky supplied\nsome information to me\nwhen he came on this podcast,\nthat if you give people\nexogenous testosterone,\nit tends to make them more\nof the way they were before.\nIf they were a jerk before,\nthey'll become more of a jerk,\nif they were very altruistic,\nthey'll become more altruistic.\nAnd then eventually I pointed out,\n\"You'll aromatize that\ntestosterone into estrogen\nand you'll start getting\nopposite effects,\"\nso it's a murky space,\nit's not straightforward.\nBut if I'm not mistaken,\ntestosterone plays a role\nin generating aggression,\nhowever, the specific hormones\nthat are involved in\ngenerating aggression via VMH\nare things other than testosterone.\nCan you tell us a little\nbit more about that?\n'Cause there's some\ninteresting surprises in there.\n- Yeah, that's a really\nimportant question.\nSo when we finally\nidentified the neurons in VMH\nthat control aggression\nwith a molecular marker,\nwe found out that that marker\nwas the estrogen receptor.\nSo that might strike\nyou as a little strange,\nwhy should aggression-promoting\nneurons in male mice\nbe labeled with the estrogen receptor?\nOther labs have shown\nthat the estrogen receptor\nin adult male mice is\nnecessary for aggression.\nIf you knock out the gene in VMH,\nthey don't fight.\nAnd it's been shown, and\na lot of this is work\nfrom your colleague,\nNirao Shah, at Stanford,\nwho is one of my former PhD students,\nthat if you castrate a mouse\nand it loses the ability to fight,\nnot only can you rescue fighting\nwith a testosterone implant,\nbut you can rescue it\nwith an estrogen implant.\nSo you can bypass\ncompletely the requirement\nfor testosterone to restore\naggressiveness to the mice.\nAnd as you say,\nit's because many of the\neffects of testosterone,\nalthough not all, many\nof them are mediated\nby its conversion to estrogen,\nby a process called aromatization,\nit's carried out by an\nenzyme called aromatase.\nIn fact, most of your listeners\nmay have heard of aromatase\n'cause aromatase inhibitors are\nwidely used in female humans\nas adjuvant chemotherapy\nfor breast cancer.\nThey are a way of reducing\nthe production of estrogen\nby preventing testosterone\nfrom being converted into estrogen.\nAnd in fact, there are a\nlot of animal experiments\nshowing if you give males\naromatase inhibitors,\nthey stop fighting,\nas well as also stop\nbeing sexually active.\nAnd so that's one of the\ncounterintuitive ideas,\nand Nirao has shown that progesterone\nalso seems to play a role in aggression,\nbecause these aggression neurons\nalso express the progesterone receptor.\nSo here are two hormones that\nare classically thought of\nas female reproductive hormones,\nthis is what goes up and goes\ndown during the estrous cycle,\nestrogen and progesterone,\nand yet, they're playing\na very important role\nin controlling aggression in male mice,\nand presumably in male humans as well.\n- Fascinating, so estrogen\nis doing many more things\nthan I think most people believe.\n- Yep.\n- And testosterone is doing\nmaybe different and fewer\nthings in some cases,\nand more in others.\nI've known some aggressive females\nover the time I've been alive,\nwhat's involved in female aggression\nthat's unique from the pathways\nthat generate male aggression?\n- Great question,\nso we and other labs have\nstudied this in both mice\nand also in fruit flies.\nSo one thing in mice that\ndistinguishes aggression\nin females from males\nis that male mice are\npretty much ready to fight\nat the drop of a hat,\nfemale mice only fight\nwhen they are nurturing\nand nursing their pups\nafter they've delivered a litter.\nAnd there is a window there\nwhere they become hyper-aggressive,\nand then after their pups are weened,\nthat aggressiveness goes away.\nSo this is pretty remarkable\nthat you take a virgin female mouse\nand expose it to a male,\nand her response is to\nbecome sexually receptive\nand to mate with him.\nAnd now you let her have her pups,\nand you put the same male\nor another male mouse\nin the cage with her,\nand instead of trying to mate\nwith him, she attacks him.\nSo there is some presumably hormonal\nand also neuronal switch\nthat's occurring in the brain\nthat switches the response of the female\nfrom sex to aggression\nwhen she goes from virginity to maternity.\nAnd we recently showed in a paper,\nthis is work from one of\nmy students, Mengyu Liu,\nthat within VMH in females,\nthere are two clearly divisible subsets\nof estrogen receptor neurons,\nand she showed that one of\nthose subsets controls fighting\nand the other one controls mating.\nAnd in fact, if you stimulate\nthe fighting-specific subset in a virgin,\nyou can get the virgin to attack,\nwhich is something that we\nwere never able to do before,\nand if you stimulate the\nmating one, you enhance mating.\nThe reason we could\nnever get these results\nwhen we stimulated the whole population\nof estrogen receptor neurons\nis that these effects are\nopposite and they cancel out.\nAnd so it turns out that\nif you measure the activity\nof the fighting and the mating neurons\ngoing from a virgin to a maternal female,\nthe aggression neurons are\nvery low in their activity\nin the virgin,\nbut once the female has pups,\nthe activation ability of\nthose neurons goes way up\nand the mating neurons stay the same.\nSo if you think of the balance\nbetween them like a seesaw,\nin the virgin, there is more activity\nin the mating neurons than\nin the fighting neurons,\nwhereas in the nursing mother,\nthere's more activity or more activation\nthe other way around,\nthe fighting neurons in the mating.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Did I say,\n\"Fighting and mating,\" the first?\nMating neurons dominate\nfighting in the virgin,\nfighting neurons dominate\nmating in the mother.\nSo that's a really cool observation,\nand it's not something\nthat happens in males,\nand we don't know what\ncauses that or controls that.\nInterestingly, this gets\ninto the whole issue\nof neurons that are present\nin females, but not in males.\nSo the field has known for a long time\nthat male and female fruit\nflies have sex-specific neurons.\nAnd most of the neurons\nthat we've identified\nin fruit flies that\ncontrol fighting in males\nare male specific,\nthey're not found in the female brain,\nbut recently, we discovered a set\nof female-specific fighting\nneurons in the female brain,\ntogether with a couple\nof other laboratories.\nNow, they do share one\ncommon population of neurons\nin both male and female flies,\nthat in females,\nactivates the female-specific\nfighting neurons,\nand in males, activates the\nmale-specific fighting neurons,\nso it's kind of a hierarchy\nwith this common neuron on top.\nAnd in mice, we discovered\nthat there are male-specific\nneurons in VMH,\nand those neurons are activated\nduring male aggression.\nNow, the neurons that\nare active in females\nwhen females fight in\nVMH are not sex specific,\nso they are also found in males.\nSo this is already showing\nyou some complexity,\nthe male mouse VMH\nhas both male-specific aggression neurons\nand generic aggression neurons.\nAnd then the female VMH,\nthe mating cells are\nonly found in females,\nthey are female specific\nand not found in the male brain.\nAnd so we're trying to find out\nwhat these sex-specific\npopulations of neurons are doing,\nbut that indicates that that\nis some of the mechanism\nby which different sexes\nshow different behaviors.\n- I'm fixated on this transition\nfrom the virgin female mouse\nto the maternal female mouse,\nand I have a couple of\nquestions about whether or not,\nfor instance, the transition is governed\nby the presence of pups.\nSo for instance, if you\ntake a virgin female,\nshe'll mate with a male,\nonce she's had pups,\nshe'll try and fight that\nmale, or presumably another\nintruder female, right?\n- Yes,\nequally towards females\nand male intruders.\n- Does that require the\npresence of her pups?\nMeaning if you were to take those pups\nand give them to another mother,\ndoes she revert to the\nmore virgin-like behavior?\nIs it triggered by lactation\nor could it actually be triggered\nby the mating behavior itself?\n'Cause it's possible for the\nvirgin to become a non-virgin,\nbut not actually have a litter of pups.\n- Right, those are all great questions,\nand we don't know the\nanswer to most of them.\nWhat I can say is that a nursing mother\ndoesn't have to have her\npups with her in the cage\nin order to attack an intruder male\nor an intruder female,\nshe is just in a state of brain\nthat makes her aggressive to any intruder.\nAnd those aggression neurons\nin that female's brain\nare activated by both male\nand female intruders equally,\nwhereas in male mice,\nthe aggression neurons\nare only ever activated\nby males, not by females,\nbecause males are never\nsupposed to attack females,\nthey're only supposed to mate with them.\nSo that's another difference\nin how those neurons are tuned\nto signals from different conspecifics.\nDoes it require lactation?\nI don't know the answer to that,\nI think there are some experiments\nwhere people have tried\nto, classical experiments,\npeople have tried to reproduce\nthe changes in hormones\nthat occur during pregnancy in female rats\nto see if it can make them aggressive.\nAnd some of those manipulations\ndo, to some extent,\nbut there's a whole biology there\nthat remains to be explored\nabout how much of this is hormones,\nhow much of this is\ncircuitry and electricity,\nand how much of it is other factors\nthat we haven't identified yet?\n- I don't want to anthropomorphize,\nbut, well, I'll just ask the question.\nSo the other day, I was\nwatching ferrets mate, right?\nThey're mustelids, and\nthey're mating behavior,\nI guess I didn't say\nwhy I was watching this,\ndoesn't matter.\n[David laughing]\nIt simply doesn't matter,\nbut if one observes the mating behaviors\nof different animals,\nwe know that there's a tremendous range\nof mating behaviors in humans.\nThere can be no aggressive component,\nthere could be an aggressive component\nin humans that have all sorts of kinks\nand fetishes and behaviors,\nand most of which probably\nhas never been documented\n'cause most of this happens in private.\nAnd here, I always say on this podcast,\nany time we're talking about\nsexual behavior in humans,\nwe're always making the presumption\nthat it's consensual, age appropriate,\ncontext appropriate and\nspecies appropriate.\nWell, today, we're talking about\na lot of different species.\nWith that said, just to set context,\nI was watching this\nvideo of ferrets mating,\nand it's quite violent actually.\nThere's a lot of neck biting,\nthere's a lot of squealing.\nIf I were going to project\nand anthropomorphize,\nI'd say it's not really clear\nthey both want to be there,\none would make that assumption.\nAnd of course, we don't\nknow, we have no idea,\nthis could be the ritual.\nIt seems, to me, that\nthere is some crossover\nof aggression and mating\nbehavior circuitry\nduring the act of the mating,\nand do you think that reflects\nthis sort of stew of competing neurons\nthat are prioritizing in real time?\nBecause, of course, as states,\nthey have persistence, as you point out,\nand you can imagine\nthat states overlapping,\nfour different states,\nthe motivational drive to mate,\nthe motivational drive to get\naway from this experience,\nthe motivational drive\nto eat at some point,\nto defecate at some point,\nall of these things are competing,\nand what we're really seeing\nis a bias in probabilities.\nBut when you look at mating\nbehavior of various animals,\nyou see an aggressive component\nsometimes, but not always.\nIs it species specific,\nis it context specific?\nAnd more generally, do\nyou think that there\nis crosstalk between these\ndifferent neuronal populations\nand the animal itself\nmight be kind of confused\nabout what's going on?\n- Right, great questions.\nI can't really speak to the issue\nof whether this is species specific,\n'cause I'm not a\nnaturalist or a zoologist.\nI've seen, like you have,\nin the wild, for example,\nlions when they mate,\nI've seen them in Africa,\nthere's often a biting\ncomponent of that as well.\nOne of the things that surprised us\nwhen we identified neurons in VMHvl\nthat control aggression in males\nis that within that population,\nthere is a subset of neurons\nthat is activated by females\nduring male-female mating encounters.\nNow, you don't generally think\nof mouse sex as rough sex,\nbut there is a lot of what superficially\nlooks like violent behavior sometimes,\nespecially if the female\nrejects the male and runs away.\nAnd there's some evidence\nthat those female-selective neurons in VMH\nare part of the mating behavior.\nIf you shut 'em down,\nthe animals don't mate as effectively\nas they otherwise would.\nWhat happens when you stimulate\nthem we don't yet know\nbecause we don't have a\nway to specifically do that\nwithout activating the\nmale aggression neurons.\nBut I think they must\nbe there for a reason\nbecause VMH is not\ntraditionally the brain region\nto which male sexual\nbehavior has been assigned.\nThat's another area called\nthe medial preoptic area,\nand there we have shown\nthat there are neurons\nthat definitely stimulate mating behavior.\nIn fact, if we activate those\nmating neurons in a male\nwhile it's in the middle\nof attacking another male,\nit will stop fighting,\nstart singing to that male\nand start to try to mount that male\nuntil we shut those neurons off.\nSo those are the\nmake-love-not-war neurons,\nand VMH are the make-war-not-love neurons,\nand there are dense interconnections\nbetween these two nuclei,\nwhich are very close to\neach other in the brain.\nAnd we've shown that\nsome of those connections\nare mutually inhibitory,\nto prevent the animal\nfrom attacking a mate\nthat it's supposed to be mating with,\nor to prevent it from\nmating with an animal\nit's supposed to be attacking.\nBut it's also possible\nthat there are some\ncooperative interactions\nbetween those structures,\nas well as antagonistic interactions,\nand the balance of whether\nit's the cooperative\nor antagonistic interactions\nthat are firing at any given moment\nin a mating encounter, as you suggest,\nmay determine whether a\nmoment of coital bliss\namong two lions may\nsuddenly turn into a snap\nor a growl and a baring of fangs.\nWe don't know that,\nbut certainly the substrate,\nthe wiring is there\nfor that to happen.\n- I'm sure people's minds are\nrunning wild with all this.\nI'll just use this as an opportunity\nto raise something I've wondered about\nfor far too long, [laughing]\nwhich is, I have a friend\nwho's a psychiatrist\nwho works on the treatment of fetishes.\nThis is not a psychiatrist\nthat I was treated by,\nI'll just point that out.\n[David laughing]\nBut they mentioned something\nvery interesting to me long ago,\nwhich is that when you\nlook at true fetishes,\nand what meets the criteria for fetish,\nthat there does seem to be some,\nwhat one would think would\nbe competing circuitry\nthat suddenly becomes aligned.\nFor instance, avoidance of\nfeces, dead bodies, feet,\nthings that are very infectious,\ntypically those states of disgust\nare antagonistic to the states of desire,\nas one would hope is present\nduring sexual behavior.\nFetishes often involve\nexactly those things\nthat are aversive, feet, dead bodies,\ndisgusting things to most people,\nand true fetishes, in\nthe pathologic sense,\nexist when people have,\nbasically, a requirement\nfor thinking about or even the presence\nof those ordinarily disgusting things\nin order to become sexually aroused.\n- Hmm.\n- As if the circuitry\nhas crossed over, and the\nstatement that wrung in my mind\nwas people don't develop\nfetishes to mailboxes,\nor to the color red, or to\nrandom objects and things,\nthey develop fetishes to things\nthat are highly infectious\nand counter-reproductive\nappetitive states.\n- Hmm.\n- So I find that interesting,\nI don't know if you have\nany reflections on that\nas to why that might be.\nI'm tempted to ask whether or not\nyou've ever observed\nfetish-like behavior in mice,\nbut I find it fascinating\nthat you have this area of the brain\nthat's so highly concerned\nwith the hypothalamus,\nin which you have these\ndense populations intermixed,\nand that the addition of a\nforebrain, especially in humans,\nthat can think and make decisions\ncould in some ways facilitate\nthe expression of these\nprimitive behaviors,\nbut could also complicate\nthe expression of primitive behaviors.\n- Right, I would agree.\nI think one way of looking at fetishes\nfrom a neurobiological standpoint\nis that they represent a kind\nof appetitive conditioning\nwhere something that is\nnatively aversive or disgusting,\nby being repeatedly paired\nwith a rewarding experience,\nchanges its valence, its sign\nso that now it somehow produces\nthe anticipation of reward\nthe next time a person sees it.\nNow, I don't know that\nliterature in animals,\nso I don't know if you could condition\na mouse to eat feces, for example,\nalthough there are animals\nthat are naturally coprophagic,\nand maybe mice do that\noccasionally, I'm not sure.\nBut that is one way to think about it,\nand that could certainly\ninvolve in humans,\nthe more recently evolved\narts of the brain,\nthe cortex that is sort of orchestrating\nboth what behaviors are happening\nand whether reward states are turning on\nin association with those\nbehaviors that are happening.\nAnd that's the part that\nI think is difficult\nand challenging to study in a mouse,\nbut certainly bears thinking about,\nbecause it's a really interesting,\nagain, sort of counterintuitive aspect.\nAgain, like rough sex,\npeople that want to have fighting,\nor violence, or aggressiveness\nin order to be sexually\naroused, and fetishes.\nAnd in fact, when we made\nthat discovery initially,\nit raised the question in my mind\nwhether some people that are\nserial rapists, for example,\nand engage in sexual violence\nmight, in some level, have\ntheir wires crossed in some way,\nthat these states that are supposed to be\npretty much separated and\nmutually antagonistic are not,\nand are actually more\nrewarding and reinforcing.\nI think it's going to be a long time\nbefore we have figured it out,\nbut when you think about it,\nthere is no treatment\nthat we have for a violent sexual offender\nthat eliminates the violence,\nbut not the sexual desire and sexual urge,\nwhether it's physical castration\nor chemical castration,\nit eliminates both.\n- Definitely an area that I think,\nwell, human neuroscience in general\nneeds a lot of tools, right?\nIn terms of how to probe and\nmanipulate neural circuitry.\nI'd love to turn to this\narea that you mentioned,\nthe medial preoptic area.\nI'm fascinated by it, because\njust as within the VMH,\nyou have these neurons for mating\nand fighting, or aggression,\nmy understanding is medial preoptic area\ncontains neurons for mating,\nbut also for temperature regulation.\nAnd perhaps I'm making\ntoo much of a leap here,\nbut I've always wondered\nabout this phrase, \"In heat,\"\nas certainly the menstrual and\nor estrous cycle in females\nis related to changes in body temperature.\nIn fact, measuring body temperature\nis one way that women can fairly reliably\npredict ovulation, et cetera.\nAlthough this is not a\nshow about contraception,\nplease rely on multiple methods\n[laughing] as necessary,\ndon't use this discussion as\nyour guide for contraception\nbased on temperature.\nBut if you stimulate certain neurons\nin the medial preoptic area,\nyou can trigger dramatic\nchanges in body temperature\nand/or mating behavior.\nWhat's the relationship, if any,\nbetween temperature and mating,\nor do we simply not know?\n- I don't know what the relationship\nis between temperature and mating neurons\nin the preoptic area.\nI suspect that they are\ndifferent populations of neurons\nbecause it's become pretty\nclear that the preoptic area\nhas many different subsets of neurons\nthat are specifically active\nduring different behaviors,\neven different phases of mating behavior.\nSo there are mounting neurons,\nthere are intromission thrusting neurons,\nand ejaculation neurons\nand sniffing neurons.\n- Wait, wait, so I think\nI've heard this before,\nbut I just want to make\nsure that people get this\nand I want to make sure I get this.\nSo you're telling me within\nmedial preoptic area,\nthere are specific neurons\nthat if you stimulate them,\nwill make males thrust\nas if they're mating?\n- No, so this is not based\non stimulation experiments.\n- Mm.\n- It's based on\nimaging experiments right now.\n- I see, I see.\n- That we see when we\nlook in the preoptic area\nat what neurons are active\nduring different phases of aggression,\nwe see that there are different neurons\nthat are active during sniffing, mounting,\nthrusting and ejaculation,\nand they become repeatedly activated\neach time the animal\ngoes through that cycle.\n- During mating, yeah.\n- During the mating cycle.\nThere are also some neurons there\nthat are active during\naggression, which are distinct,\nand we don't know whether those neurons\nare there to promote aggression\nor to inhibit mating when\nanimals are fighting.\nWe have some evidence that\nsuggest it may be the latter,\nbut we don't know for sure yet.\nThe thermosensitive neurons\nare really interesting,\nbecause you mentioned\nthe phrase, \"In heat,\"\nand then in the context of aggression,\nyou talk about hotblooded\npeople or hotheads,\nthere's just recently a paper\nshowing there are thermoregulatory\nneurons in VMH as well.\nSo all of these homeostatic systems\nfor metabolic control\nand temperature control\nare intermingled in these nuclei,\nthese zones that control these\nbasic survival behaviors,\nlike mating and aggression\nand predator defense.\nAnd I would imagine that\nthe thermal regulation\nis tightly connected\nto energy expenditure,\nand that, again, these\nneurons are mixed together\nto facilitate integration\nof all these signals\nby the brain in some way\nthat we don't understand\nto maintain the proper balance\nbetween energy conservation\nand energy consumption\nduring this particular\nbehavior or that behavior.\nI mean, I've always been\nfascinated by the question,\nwhy is it that violence\ngoes up in the summertime\nwhen the temperatures are high?\nDoes it really have something to do\nwith the idea that increased\ntemperature increases violence?\nIt seems hard to believe\nbecause we're homeothermic\nand we pretty much stay\naround 98.6 Fahrenheit.\nIt could be other social\nreasons why that happens,\npeople are outside, out on the street,\nbumping into each other,\nbut I think there could well be something\nthat ties thermoregulation\nto aggressiveness,\nas well as to mating behavior.\n- Fascinating, yeah.\nI ask in the hopes that\nmaybe in the years to come\nyour lab will parse some of\nthe temperature relationships.\nAnd I realize it could be also regulated\nby hormones in general,\nso it's tapping into two systems\nfor completely different reasons,\nbut anyway, an area that intrigues me,\nbecause of this notion of hotheadedness.\n- Right.\n- Or cool, calm and collected.\nAnd also the fact that,\nand I probably should've\nasked about this earlier,\nthat arousal itself is tethered\nto the whole mating and\nreproductive process.\nI mean, without a sort of seesawing back\nbetween the sympathetic\nand parasympathetic\narousal, relaxed states,\nthere is no mating that will take place.\nSo it's fascinating the way\nthese different competing\nforces and seesaws operate.\nSeveral times during\nthe discussion so far,\nwe've hit on this idea\nthat the same behavior can\nreflect different states,\nand different states can converge\non multiple behaviors as well.\nYou had a paper not long\nago about mounting behavior,\nwhich I found fascinating.\nMaybe you could tell us about that result,\nbecause, to me, it really speaks\nto the fact that mounting behavior\ncan, in one context, be sexual,\nand in another context,\nactually be related to,\nwe presume, dominance.\nAnd I think that my friends\nwho practice jujitsu,\nwhen I talk about that result,\nthey say, \"Of course,\nmounting the other person\nand dominating them,\nthere's nothing sexual about it,\"\nit's about overtaking them physically,\nliterally being on their neck side,\nas opposed to lying on their own back.\n- [David] Hmm.\n- Just fascinating,\nvery primitive.\n- Hmm.\n- And yet, I think speaks to this idea\nthat mounting behavior might be\none of the most fundamental ways\nin which animals and perhaps even humans\nexpress dominance and/or\nsexual interactions.\n- Yep, and that's a fascinating question,\nand it was harder to figure out\nthan you might've thought.\nSo there's been this debate\nfor a long time in the field,\nwhen you see two male\nmice mounting each other,\nis this homosexual behavior,\nis this a case of mistaken\nsexual identification,\nor is this dominance behavior?\nAnd if you train an AI algorithm\nto try to distinguish male-male mounting\nfrom male-female mounting,\nit does not do a very good job,\nbecause motorically, those\nbehaviors look so similar.\nAnd so how did we wind up figuring out\nthat most male-male mounting\nis dominance mounting?\nThere are two important clues,\none is the context,\nand so male-male mounting\ntends to be more prominent among mice\nwhen they haven't had a\nlot of fighting experience.\nAnd then as they become more\nexperienced in fighting,\nthey will show relatively less mounting\ntowards the other male and more attack,\nand they'll transition quickly\nfrom mounting to attack,\nand so the mounting is always seen\nin this context of an overall\naggressive interaction.\nAnd then the second thing,\nwhich, believe it or not, was suggested\nby a computational,\ntheoretical person in my lab,\nAnn Kennedy, who now has\nher own lab at Northwestern.\nShe said, \"Well, males are known to sing\nwhen they mount females,\nultrasonic vocalizations,\nwhy don't you see what kinds\nof songs they're singing\nwhen they're mounting males?\nMaybe it's a different kind of song.\"\nWell, what we found out is,\nthey don't sing at all when\nthey're mounting a male,\nso you can easily distinguish\nwhether mounting behavior by a male mouse\nis reproductive or agonistic, aggressive,\naccording to whether it's accompanied\nby ultrasonic vocalizations or not.\nAnd it turns out that\ndifferent brain regions\nare maximally active\nduring these different types of mounting.\nSo VMH, the aggression locus\nis actually active during\ndominance mounting,\nand you can stimulate\nmounting, dominance mounting,\nif you weakly activate VMH,\nwhereas MPOA is most strongly activated\nduring sexual mounting,\nand that's always accompanied\nby the ultrasonic vocalization.\nSo this shows how difficult\nand dangerous it can be\nto try to infer an animal's\nstate, or intent, or emotion,\nfrom the behavior that it's exhibiting\nbecause the same behavior can\nmean very different things\ndepending on the context of the\ninteraction with the animal.\n- And I would say, even more so\nwith when that animal is a\nhuman or is multiple humans.\n- That's right, and\nthere are many examples,\nanimals show chasing to obtain food,\na prey animal that they're\ngoing to kill and eat,\nand they show chasing to obtain a mate\nthat they're going to have sex with.\nAnd so the intent of the\nchasing is completely different,\nand we don't know in all these cases\nwhether there are separate circuits\nor common circuits that\nare being activated.\n- I'm obsessed with dogs and dog breeds\nand et cetera, et cetera,\nand one thing I can tell you\nis that female dogs will mount and thrust.\nWe had a female pit bull\nmix, a very sweet dog,\nbut in observing her,\nit convinced me that one can never assume\nthat male dogs are more\naggressive than female dogs.\nIt turns out, in talking to people\nwho are quite skilled at dog\ngenetics and dog breeding,\nthat there's a dominance\nhierarchy within a litter\nand it crosses over\nmale-female delineations.\nSo you can get a female in the\nlitter that's very dominant\nand a male that's very subordinate,\nand no one really knows what relates to.\nThis is also why little dogs\nsometimes will get right up in the face\nof a big Doberman Pinscher.\n- Mm.\n- And just start barking,\nwhich is an idiotic thing for it to do,\nbut they can be dominant\nover a much larger dog.\n- Hmm.\n- Very strange,\nto me anyway.\nFemale-female mounting,\ndo you observe it in mice?\nAre there known circuits,\nand what evokes female-female mounting,\nor female-to-male mounting if it occurs?\n- Good, yes, there are\nclear examples of females\ndisplaying male-type mounting behavior\ntowards other females.\nWe see this most commonly in the lab\nwhere we are housing\nfemales with their sisters,\nsay three or four in a cage,\nwe take one out and we\nhave her mate with a male,\nwhere the male's doing the mounting,\nnow we take that female\nand we put her back in the\ncage with her litter mates\nand she starts mounting them.\nNow, what the function of that is,\nif it has any function,\nor what it means, what's\ndriving it, we don't know,\nbut we do know that if we stimulate\nthe neurons that control mounting in males\nin the medial preoptic area,\nif we stimulate that same\npopulation in females,\nit evokes male-type mounting\ntowards either a male or a female target.\nIn fact, we have a movie\nwhere we have a female\nthat has just been mounted by a male,\nso the male's on top and she's underneath,\nand we stimulate that region\nof MPOA in the female.\nAnd she crawls out from\nunderneath the male\nwho has just mounted her,\ncircles around behind him\nand climbs up on top of him\nand starts to try to mount\nhim and thrust at him.\n- That has a name online,\nit's called a switch.\n[Andrew laughing]\n- Is that right? [laughing]\n- [Andrew] Don't ask me how I know that.\n- Okay.\n- But it's a pretty, yeah,\nit's a term that you hear.\nYou also hear the term\ntopping from the bottom,\nwhich it sounds like\nthat is a literal topping\nfrom the bottom.\n- I see.\n- That's a more of a psychological phrase,\nfrom what I hear.\nI have friends that are\neducating me in this language,\nmostly because I find\nthis kind of neurobiological\ndiscussion fascinating.\nAnd at some point, right?\nI attempt, in my mind, to\nsuperimpose observations\nfrom the online communities.\n- Yeah.\n- That I'm told about\nand asked about to this,\nbut I should point out,\nit's always dangerous,\nand in fact, inappropriate\nto make a one-to-one link.\n- Yes.\n- Humans, they maintain all\nthe same neural circuitry\nand pathways that we're\ntalking about today in mice,\nbut that forebrain does\nallow for context, et cetera.\n- Yep.\n- Yeah.\n- So what the function\nis of female mounting,\nI don't know, it could be a\ntype of dominance display.\nIt's hard to measure that\nbecause people haven't worked\non female-dominance hierarchies\nto the same extent that they've worked\non male-dominance hierarchies,\nbut it indicates that the\ncircuits for male-type mounting\nare there in females,\nas early work from Catherine\nDulac suggested some years ago.\n- Fascinating, fascinating.\nI love that paper because,\nas you pointed out for chase,\nfor mounting behavior, we see it\nand we think one thing specifically,\nand after hearing this result,\nactually, I'm not a big\nfan of fight sports.\nI watch them occasionally\n'cause friends are into them,\nbut I've seen boxing matches, MMA matches,\nwhere at the end of a round,\nif someone felt that they dominated,\nthey will do the unsportsmanlike thing\nof thrusting on the\nback of the other person\nbefore they get off.\n- Really?\n- Almost like, \"I dominated you, and I'm,\"\nso mimicking sexual-like behavior,\nbut there's no reason to\nthink that it's sexual,\nbut they're sending a message.\n- Yeah.\n- Of dominance is what it implies.\nI'd love to talk about something\nslightly off from this circuitry,\nbut I think that's\nrelated to the circuitry,\nat least in some way,\nwhich is this structure that\nI've always been fascinated by\nand I can't figure out\nwhat the hell it's for,\n'cause it seems to be\ninvolved in everything,\nwhich is the PAG, the periaqueductal gray,\nwhich is a little bit\nfurther back in the brain,\nfor people that don't know.\nIt's been studied in the context of pain,\nit's been studied in the context\nof the so-called lordosis response,\nthe receptivity or arching\nof the back of the female\nto receive intromission\nand mating from the male.\nHow should we think about PAG?\nClearly, it can't be\ninvolved in everything,\nI'm guessing it's at least as complex\nas some of these other regions\nthat we've been talking about,\ndifferent types of neurons\ncontrolling different things,\nbut how does PAG play into this?\nIn particular, I want to know,\nis there some mechanism of\npain modulation and control\nduring fighting and/or mating?\nAnd the reason I ask is that,\nwhile I'm not a combat sports person,\nyears ago, I did a little\nbit of martial arts,\nand it always was impressive to me\nhow little it hurt to get\npunched during a fight\nand how much it hurt\nafterwards, [laughing] right?\nSo there clearly is some\nendogenous pain control.\n- Yep.\n- That then wears off,\nand then you feel beat up.\n- [David] Yep.\n- Or at least, in my case, I felt beat up.\nWhat's PAG doing vis-a-vis pain,\nand what's pain doing vis-a-vis\nthese other behaviors?\n- Good, good.\nSo I think of PAG\nlike a old-fashioned\ntelephone switchboard,\nwhere there are calls coming in,\nand then the cables have to\nbe punched into the right hole\nto get the information,\nto be routed to the right\nrecipient on the other end of it,\nbecause pretty much every\ntype of innate behavior\nyou can think of has\nhad the PAG implicated.\nAnd there's a whole literature\nshowing the involvement\nof the PAG in fear,\ndifferent regions of the PAG,\nthe dorsal PAG is involved\nin panic-like behavior, running away,\nthe ventral PAG is involved\nin freezing behavior.\nBoth the MPOA and VMH send\nprojections to the PAG,\nto different regions of the PAG.\nSo in cross-section, I hate to say this,\nbut in cross-section, the\nPAG kind of looks like\nthe water in a toilet\nwhen you're standing\nover an open toilet bowl.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- And if you imagine\na clock face projected onto that,\nit's like the PAG has sectors,\nfrom one to 12, maybe even more of them,\nand in each of those sectors,\nyou find different neurons\nfrom the hypothalamus are projecting.\nSo could turn out that there\nis a topographic arrangement\nalong the dorsal-ventral axis of the PAG\nand the medial-lateral axis of the PAG\nthat determines the type of behavior\nthat will be emitted when neurons\nin that region are stimulated.\nAnd I think sort of all of the evidence\nis pointing in that direction,\nbut by no means, has it been mapped out.\nNow, the thing that you\nmentioned about it not hurting\nwhen you got beat up during martial arts,\nthere is a well-known phenomenon\ncalled fear-induced analgesia,\nwhere when an animal is\nin a high state of fear,\nlike if it's trying to defend itself,\nthere is a suppression of pain responses,\nand I'm not sure completely\nabout the mechanisms\nand how well that's understood,\nbut for example, the adrenal\ngland has a peptide in it\nthat is released from the adrenal medulla,\nwhich controls the\nfight-or-flight responses,\nand that peptide has analgesic activities.\nNow, whether.\n- May I ask what that\npeptide is?\n- It's called\nbovine adrenal medullary peptide\nof 22 amino acid residues.\nAnd I only know about it\nbecause it activates a receptor\nthat we discovered many years ago\nthat's involved in pain,\nand we thought it promoted pain,\nbut it turns out that this\nactually inhibits pain,\nit's like an endogenous analgesic.\nWhether this is happening,\nthis type of analgesia\nis happening when an animal\nis engaged in offensive aggression\nor in mating behavior, I don't know,\nbut it certainly is possible.\nAnd I don't know whether\nthese analgesic mechanisms\nare happening in the PAG,\nthey could also be happening\na little further down\nin the spinal cord.\nThe PAG is really continuous\nwith the spinal cord,\nif you just follow it down\ntowards the tail of an animal,\nyou will wind up in the spinal cord.\nAnd so it could be that\nthere are influences acting\nat many levels on pain in the PAG\nand in the spinal cord as well.\nAnd it may well be known,\nI just don't know it,\nI want to distinguish\nclearly between things\nthat are not known,\nthat I know are unknown,\nwhich is in a fairly small\narea where I have expertise,\nfrom things that may be known,\nbut I'm ignorant of them,\nbecause I just don't have a broad enough\nknowledge base to know that.\n- Sure, we appreciate those delineations.\nThank you, PAG, I think\nthis description of it\nas an old-fashioned telephone switchboard,\nand now every time I look into\nthe toilet, I'll think about\nthe periaqueductal gray.\n- [laughing] That's right.\n- [Andrew] And every time I see an image\nof periaqueductal gray,\nI'll think about a toilet.\n- That's right. [laughing]\n- That is an excellent description,\nbecause, in fact, I drew a circle\nwith a little thing at the bottom.\nAnd well, I'll put a post\nor link to a picture of PAG\nand you'll understand why\nDavid and I are chuckling here,\nbecause, indeed, it looks like a toilet,\nwhen staring into a toilet.\nTell us about tachykinin,\nI've talked about this a couple times\non different podcast episodes\nbecause of its relationship\nto social isolation,\nand in part, because\nthe podcast was launched\nduring a time when there\nwas more social isolation.\nMy understanding is that tachykinin,\nand you'll tell us what it is in a moment,\nis present in flies\nand mice and in humans,\nand may do similar\nthings in those species.\n- That's right, so\ntachykinin refers to a family\nof related neuropeptides.\nSo these are brain chemicals,\nthey're different from\ndopamine and serotonin\nin that they're not\nsmall, organic molecules,\nthey're actually short pieces of protein\nthat are directly encoded by genes\nthat are active in specific neurons\nand not in others.\nAnd when those neurons are active,\nthose neuropeptides are released\ntogether with classical transmitters,\nlike glutamate, whatever.\nTachykinins have been\nfamously implicated in pain,\nparticularly Tachykinin-I,\nwhich is called Substance P,\none of the original pain modulating,\nthis is something that\npromotes inflammatory pain.\nBut there are other tachykinin genes,\nin mice, there are two,\nin humans, I think there are three,\nand in Drosophila, there's one.\nAnd the way we got into tachykinins\nis from studying aggression in flies.\nWe thought, since neuropeptides\nhave this remarkable parallel\nevolutionary conservation\nof structure and function,\nlike Neuropeptide Y controls feeding\nin worms, in flies and mice and in people.\nOxytocin-like peptides\ncontrol reproduction\nin worms and mice and in people.\nWe thought we might find\npeptides that control aggression\nin flies and in people,\nand so we did a screen,\nunbiased screen of peptides,\nand found, indeed, that\none of the tachykinins,\nDrosophila tachykinin, those\nneurons when you activate them\nstrongly promote aggression,\nand it depends on the\nrelease of tachykinin.\nNow, the interesting thing is that,\nin flies, just like in people\nand practically any other social animal\nthat shows aggression,\nsocial isolation increases aggressiveness.\nSo putting a violent prisoner\nin solitary confinement\nis absolutely the worst,\nmost counterproductive thing\nyou could do to them.\nAnd indeed, we found in flies\nthat social isolation increases the level\nof tachykinin in the brain,\nand if we shut that gene down,\nit prevents the isolation\nfrom increasing aggression.\nSo since my lab also works on mice,\nit was natural to see whether tachykinins\nmight be upregulated in social isolation\nand whether they play\na role in aggression.\nAnd this is work done\nby a former postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky,\nnow at University of\nSalt Lake City in Utah,\nand she found, remarkably,\nthat when mice are socially\nisolated for two weeks,\nthere is this massive upregulation\nof Tachykinin-II in their brain.\nIn fact, if you tag the peptide\nwith a green fluorescent protein\nfrom a jellyfish, genetically,\nthe brain looks green when\nthe mice are socially isolated\n'cause there's so much\nof this stuff released.\nAnd she went on to show that\nthat increase in tachykinin\nis responsible for the\neffect of social isolation\nto increase aggressiveness\nand to increase fear\nand to increase anxiety.\nAnd in fact, there are drugs\nthat block the receptor for tachykinin\nwhich were tested in humans and abandoned\nbecause they had no efficacy\nin the tests that they were analyzed for.\nIf you give those drugs to\na socially isolated mouse,\nit blocks all of the\neffects of social isolation.\nIt blocks the aggression,\nit blocks the increased fear\nand the increased anxiety,\nand Moriel described it,\n\"The mice just look chill.\"\nIt's not a sedative,\nwhich is really important,\nit's not that the mice are going to sleep.\nMost remarkably is, once\nyou socially isolate a mouse\nand it becomes aggressive,\nyou can never put it back in its cage\nwith its brothers from its litter\nbecause it will kill them all overnight,\nbut if you give it this drug,\nwhich is called osanetant,\nthat blocks Tachykinin-II,\nthat mouse can be returned\nto the cage with its brothers\nand will not attack them,\nand seems to be happy about\nthat for the rest of the time.\nSo this is an incredibly\npowerful effect of this drug,\nand I've been really interested\nin trying to get pharmaceutical\ncompanies to test this drug,\nwhich has a really good\nsafety profile in humans,\nin testing it in people\nwho are subjected to\nsocial isolation stress\nor bereavement stress.\nAnd this is one of the areas\nwhere I learned an eye-opening lesson,\nas a basic scientist who naively thought\nthat if you make a discovery\nand it has translational\napplications to humans,\nthat pharmaceutical companies\nare going to be falling all\nover themselves to try it.\nAnd they are not interested,\nbecause once burned, twice shy,\nthese drugs were tested for\nefficacy in schizophrenia.\nI have no idea why,\nthere's very little preclinical\ndata to suggest that.\nNot surprisingly, they failed.\nWhen a drug fails in\nclinical trials in Phase 3,\nit costs $100 million to the company\nthat carried out that clinical trial.\nSo there's a huge slag heap\nof discarded pharmaceuticals,\nmany of them inhibitors\nof neuropeptide action,\nthat could be useful in other indications,\nsuch as the one we discovered,\nbut there's a huge economic disincentive\nfor pharmaceutical companies\nto test them again,\nbecause the conclusion that they drew\nfrom all these failed tests,\nparticularly in the 2010s and before that,\nis that the reason they failed\nis because animal experiments with drugs\ndon't predict how humans\nwill respond to the drugs,\nand therefore, we shouldn't\ntry to extrapolate\nfrom any other data that we\nget from animal experiments,\nmouse or rat experiments to humans,\nbecause they'll lead us\ndown the wrong track,\nand I think that that is probably wrong.\nIn some cases, it may be right,\nbut in other cases, there's\ngood reason to think,\nbecause these brain regions and molecules\nare so evolutionarily conserved\nthat they ought to be playing\na similar role in humans.\nIn fact, there is a paper showing that\nin humans that have borderline\npersonality disorder,\nthere's a strong correlation\nbetween their self-reported\nlevel of aggressiveness\nand serum levels of a tachykinin,\nin this case, Tachykinin-I,\nas detected by radioimmunoassay.\nThis is work of Emil Coccaro,\nwho's a clinical psychiatrist\nat the University of Chicago.\nSo there is a smoking gun in\nthe case of humans as well.\nAnd I was actually trying to interest\na pharmaceutical company\nthat was testing these drugs,\nactually, for treatment of hot flashes\nin females, in humans,\nwhere there is actually good animal data\nto think that it might be useful,\nbut I realized that this clinical trial\nwas going on during the COVID pandemic.\nAnd I approached him and said,\n\"Look, nature may have\nactually done for you\nthe experiment that I want you to do,\n'cause some of the people\nwho are getting drug or placebo\nare going to have been socially isolated\nand some of them will have not.\nWhy don't you get them to\nfill out questionnaires\nand see whether the ones\nwho were given the drug\nand socially isolated\nfelt less stressed and less anxious\nthan the ones who were\nnot socially isolated?\"\nAnd they would not touch it,\nbecause they're in the\nmiddle of a clinical trial\nfor a different indication for this drug,\nand they have to report any observation\nthat they make about that drug\nin their patient population.\nSo if they were to ask these questions\nand get an unfavorable answer,\n\"Oh my God, I felt even worse\nwhen I took this drug and I was isolated,\"\nthey would be obliged to\nreport that to the FDA\nand that could torpedo the chances\nfor the drug being approved\nin the thing that it was\nin clinical trials for.\nSo it's better not to ask and not to know\nthan it is to try to\nfind out more information\nthat could lead to another\nclinical indication.\nSo I remain convinced\nthat this family of drugs\ncould have very powerful uses\nin treating some forms\nof stress-induced anxiety\nor aggressiveness in humans,\nbut it's just very difficult,\nfor economic reasons,\nto find a way to get\nsomebody to test that.\n- Yeah, a true shame that\nthese companies won't do this,\nand especially given the fact\nthat many of these drugs exist\nand their safety profiles are established,\n'cause that's always\na serious consideration.\n- Yep.\n- When embarking on a clinical trial.\nPerhaps in hearing this discussion,\nsomeone out there will understand\nthe key importance of this\nand will reach out to us,\nwe'll provide ways to do that,\nto get such a study going in humans.\nBecause I think if enough laboratories\nran small-scale clinical trials,\npharma certainly would\nperk up their ears, right?\nI mean, they're so strategic.\n- Yep.\n- Sometimes to their own.\n- I mean, I would like to say also,\nI'd like to see this tested on pets.\nI mean, there's a huge\nnumber of pets right now\nthat are suffering separation anxiety\nbecause humans bought\nthem to keep them company\nduring the COVID pandemic,\nand now they're home alone.\n- And now they're home alone,\nyeah.\n- Okay?\nAnd if this thing works in mice,\nthere's certainly a higher chance\nit's going to work in dogs or in cats\nthan it is going to work in humans.\nAnd if it did, that would\nbe even more encouragement\nto continue along those lines.\nPeople sometimes forget that\nalthough we work on animals\nand we ultimately want\nto understand humans,\nwe care about how our results\napply to the welfare of animals as well,\nand particularly domestic pets,\nwhich is a multi-billion-dollar industry\nin this country.\nSo if there is ways that they\ncan be made to feel better\nwhen they're separated from their owners,\nthat would certainly be a good thing.\n- Absolutely, we will put out the call,\nwe are putting out the call,\nand I know for sure\nthere will be a response.\nJust underscoring what we've\nbeen talking about even more,\nevery time we hear\nabout a school shooting,\nlike in Texas recently,\nor I happened to be in New York\nduring the time when there\nwas a subway shooting.\nFor whatever reason, I listened\nto the book about Columbine,\nthat went into a very detailed way\nabout the origin of those\nboys that committed that,\nand every single time,\nthe person who commits those acts\nis socially isolated,\nas far as I know.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- There might be some exceptions there.\nAnd sometimes this crosses over\nwith other mental health issues,\nbut sometimes no, no apparent\nmental health issues.\nSo social isolation clearly drives\npowerful neurochemical and\nneuro biological changes,\nI really hope that Tachykinin-I and II,\nthose are the main ones\nin humans?\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Will be explored in more detail.\nAlso, I didn't know that\nTachykinin-I is Substance P.\n- Yes.\n- And Substance P\nis Tachykinin-I.\n- Yes.\nTachykinin-I is the gene name,\nand Tachykinin-II, in humans,\nis called Neurokinin B,\nthat's the name of the protein.\nI just refer to it by the gene name\n'cause it makes it easier\nand I don't have to keep remembering\ntwo names for each thing.\n- And if I'm not mistaken,\nyou put yourself in the\ncompany of geneticists\nbecause your original\ntraining was in genetics,\nimmunology and areas\nrelated to that.\n- It was in cell biology,\nand I didn't actually have\nformal training in genetics\nas a graduate student,\nbut I think I'm a geneticist at heart,\nthat's just the way I like\nto think about things.\nAnd when I started working\non flies, that sort of,\nI came out of the closet as a geneticist,\nas it were. [laughing]\n- Wonderful, as long as\nwe're talking about humans,\nI'd love to get your thoughts\nabout human studies of emotion.\nI know you wrote this\nbook with Ralph Adolphs,\nyou have this new book, which\nwe'll provide a link to,\nwhich I've read front to\nback twice, it's phenomenal.\n- Thank you.\n- I've mentioned it before\non the podcast, it's really,\nthere are books that are worth reading,\nand then there are books\nthat are important,\nand I think this book is truly important\nfor the general population\nto read and understand,\nand neuroscientists should read\nand understand the contents,\nbecause we, as a culture,\nare way off in terms of\nhow we think about emotions\nand states and behaviors.\nSo we'll put a link to that,\nit's really worth the time\nand energy to read it,\nand it's written beautifully,\nI should say.\n- Thank you.\n- Very accessible even for non-scientists.\nThere's a heat map diagram in\nthat book that I think about,\nthis is a heat map diagram\nof subjective reports\nthat people gave of where\nthey experience an emotion,\nor a feeling, a somatic feeling,\nin their body, or in their head, or both,\nwhen they are angry, sad, calm, lonely,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAnd I wouldn't want people\nto think that those heat maps\nwere generated by any\nphysiological measurement,\nbecause they were not.\nAnd yet, I don't think\nwe can have a discussion\nabout emotions and states\nand the sorts of behaviors\nthat we're talking about today\nwithout thinking about the body also.\n- [David] Yep.\n- And I'm not coming to this\nas a Northern California, mind-body.\n- Yeah.\n- I've been to Esalen once.\n[David laughing]\nI didn't go in the baths,\nI went there, I gave a talk and I left.\nIt is very beautiful.\nIf anyone wants to know\nwhat it looks like,\nI think that final scene of\n\"Mad Men\" is shot at Esalen,\nit's a very beautiful place.\nAnd yet, mind-body, to me, is\na neurobiological construct.\n- Yes.\n- Because the nervous system\nextends through out of the cranial vault\nand into the spinal cord.\n- Yeah.\n- And body and back and forth, okay.\nHow should we think about\nthe body, in terms of states?\nAnd at some point, I'd\nlove for you to comment\non that heat map experiment,\nbecause it does seem that\nthere's some regularity\nas to where people experience emotions.\nWhen people are in a rage, for instance,\nthey seem to feel it both in\ntheir gut and in their head,\nit seems, on average.\nAnd people love to\nextrapolate to gut intuition\nor that the chakras or\nanger is in the stomach,\nand this goes to Eastern\nmedicine, et cetera.\nHow should we think about mind-body\nin the context of states,\nand think about it as scientists,\nmaybe even as neuroscientists\nor geneticists?\n- Good, so for the answer\nto the first question\nabout the heat maps\nand people associating\ncertain parts of their body\nwith certain emotional feelings,\nthis goes back to something\ncalled the somatic marker hypothesis,\nthat was proposed by Antonio Damasio,\nwho is a neurologist at USC,\nthe idea that our subjective feeling\nof a particular emotion is,\nin part, associated with a sensation\nof something happening in a\nparticular part of our body,\nthe gut, the heart,\nI don't see the liver\ninvoked very much in\nemotional characterization,\nbut.\n- But gall\nand the gallbladder.\n- Yes.\n- Somebody having a lot of gall.\n- That's right.\n- I don't know why I make\na fist when I say that.\n- Right.\n- But I'm guessing\nthe gall bladder is shaped like a fist.\n[Andrew laughing]\n- That's right,\nand if there is a physiology\nunderlying these heat maps,\nit could reflect increased blood flow\nto these different structures.\nAnd that, in turn, reflects\nwhat you were talking about,\nthat is, emotion definitely involves\ncommunication between\nthe brain and the body,\nand it's bidirectional communication,\nand it's mediated by the\nperipheral nervous system,\nthe sympathetic and the\nparasympathetic nervous system,\nwhich control heart rate, for example,\nblood vessel, blood pressure.\nAnd those neurons receive\ninput from the hypothalamus\nand other brain regions,\ncentral brain regions that\ncontrol their activity.\nAnd when the brain is put\nin a particular state,\nit activates sympathetic\nand parasympathetic neurons,\nwhich have effects on the\nheart and on blood pressure,\nand these, in turn,\nfeed back onto the brain\nthrough the sensory system.\nAnd a large part of this\nbidirectional communication\nis also mediated through the vagus nerve,\nwhich many of your listeners and viewers\nmay have heard about\nbecause it's become a topic\nof intense activity now.\nPeople have known for a long time,\nso the vagus nerve is a\nbundle of nerve fibers\nthat comes out basically of your skull,\nout of the central nervous system,\nand then sends fibers\ninto your heart, your gut,\nall sorts of visceral organs.\nAnd that information is both,\nyou used the words\nearlier in our discussion,\nafferent and efferent.\nSo the vagal fibers sense things\nthat are happening in the body,\nso the reason you feel your stomach\ntied up in knots if you're tense\nis that those vagal fibers\nare sensing the contraction\nof the gut muscles,\nand they're also afferents,\nwhich means that information\ncoming out of the brain\ncan influence those\nperipheral organs as well.\nAnd there's work from a number of labs,\njust in the last six months or so,\nwhere people are starting\nto decode the components\nof the different fibers\nin the vagus nerve.\nAnd it's amazing how much specificity is,\nthere are specific vagal\nnerves that go to the lung,\nthat control breathing responses,\nthat go to the gut,\nthat go to other organs.\nIt's almost like a set\nof color-coded lines,\nlabeled lines for those things.\nAnd now how those vagal afferents\nplay a role in the playing\nout of emotion states\nis a fascinating question\nthat people are just beginning\nto scrape the surface of.\nBut I think what's exciting now\nis that people are going\nto be developing tools\nthat will allow us to turn on or turn off\nspecific subsets of fibers\nwithin the vagus nerve\nand ask how that affects\nparticular emotional behaviors.\nSo you're absolutely right,\nthis brain-body connection is critical,\nnot just for the gut, but for the heart,\nfor the lungs, for all kinds\nof other parts of your body,\nand Darwin recognized that as well.\nAnd I think it's a central\nfeature of emotion state,\nand I think, what underlies\nour subjective feelings of an emotion.\n- Incredible, well, David, I have to say,\nas a true fan of the work\nthat your lab has been\ndoing over so many decades,\nand first of all, I was delighted\nwhen you stopped working on stem cells.\n[David laughing]\nNot because you weren't doing\nincredible work there,\nbut because I saw a talk\nwhere you showed a movie of an octopus\nspitting out, or not spitting,\nbut squirting out a bunch\nof ink and escaping,\nand you said you were going to work\non things of the sort that\nwe're talking about today,\nfear, aggression, mating\nbehaviors, social behaviors.\nIt's been incredible to see the\nwork that your lab has done,\nand I know I speak on behalf\nof a tremendous number of people\nwhen I say thank you for taking time\nout of your important schedule\nto share with us what you've learned.\nMy last question is a simple one,\nwhich is, will you come back\nand talk to us again in the future\nabout the additional\nwork that's sure to come?\n- I would be happy to do that,\nand I really have\nappreciated your questions,\nthey've all been right on the money,\nyou've hit all of the\ncritical, important issues\nin this field.\nAnd you've uncovered what is known,\nthe little bit is known,\nand how much is not known,\nand I think it's important to\nemphasize the unknown things,\nbecause that's what the next\ngeneration of neuroscientists\nhas to solve.\nAnd so I hope this will help\nto attract young people into this field,\nbecause it's so important,\nparticularly for our\nunderstanding of mental illness\nand mental health and psychiatry,\nwe've got to figure\nout how emotion systems\nare controlled in a causal way\nif we ever want to improve\non the psychiatric\ntreatments that we have now,\nand that's going to require\nthe next generation of\npeople coming into the field.\n- Absolutely, I second that.\nWell, thank you, it's been a delight.\n- Thank you, great, really appreciate it.\n- Thank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion with Dr. David Anderson.\nPlease also be sure to\ncheck out his new book,\n\"The Nature of the Beast:\nHow Emotions Guide Us\".\nIt's a truly masterful exploration\nof the
