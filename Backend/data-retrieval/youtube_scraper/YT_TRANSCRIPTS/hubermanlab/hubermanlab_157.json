    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[lively music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Erich Jarvis.\nDr. Jarvis is a professor at\nthe Rockefeller University\nin New York City\nand his laboratory studies,\nthe neurobiology of\nvocal learning, language,\nspeech disorders,\nand remarkably, the\nrelationship between language,\nmusic and movement, in particular dance.\nHis work spans from genomics,\nso the very genes that make up our genome\nand the genomes of other species\nthat speak and have language\nsuch as songbirds and parrots\nall the way up to neural circuits,\nthat is the connections\nin the brain and body\nthat govern our ability to learn\nand generate specific sounds\nand movements coordinated\nwith those sounds,\nincluding hand movements\nand all the way up to cognition,\nthat is our ability to\nthink in specific ways,\nbased on what we are saying\nand the way that we comprehend\nwhat other people are\nsaying, singing and doing.\nAs you'll soon see,\nI was immediately transfixed\nand absolutely enchanted\nby Dr. Jarvis's description\nof his work and the ways that it impacts\nall the various aspects of our lives.\nFor instance, I learned from\nDr. Jarvis that as we read,\nwe are generating very low-levels\nof motor activity in our throat.\nThat is, we are speaking the\nwords that we are reading\nat a level below the perception of sound\nor our own perception of those words.\nBut if one were to put an amplifier\nor to measure the firing of those muscles\nin our vocal chords,\nwe'd find that as we're\nreading information,\nwe are actually speaking that information.\nAnd as I learned, and you'll soon learn,\nthere's a direct link\nbetween those species\nin the world that have song and movement,\nwhich many of us would\nassociate with dance\nand our ability to learn and\ngenerate complex language.\nSo for people with speech\ndisorders like stutter,\nor for people who are interested\nin multiple language learning,\nbilingual, trilingual, et cetera,\nand frankly for anyone who is interested\nin how we communicate through\nwords, written or spoken,\nI'm certain today's episode is going to be\nan especially interesting\nand important one for you.\nDr. Jarvis's work is so pioneering\nthat he has been awarded\ntruly countless awards.\nI'm not going to take our time to list off\nall the various important\nawards that he's received,\nbut I should point out\nthat in addition to being\na decorated professor\nat the Rockefeller University,\nhe is also an investigator\nwith the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,\nthe so-called HHMI.\nAnd for those of you that don't know,\nHHMI investigators are selected\non an extremely competitive basis\nthat they have to re-up,\nthat is they have to\nrecompete every five years.\nThey actually receive a\ngrade every five years\nthat dictates whether or\nnot they are no longer\na Howard Hughes investigator\nor whether or not they can\nadvance to another five years\nof funding for their important research.\nAnd indeed, Howard Hughes investigators\nare selected not just for\nthe rigor of their work,\nbut for their pioneering spirit\nand their ability to take on\nhigh-risk, high-benefit work,\nwhich is exactly the kind of work\nthat Dr. Jarvis has been\nproviding for decades now.\nAgain, I think today's episode\nis one of the more unique\nand special episodes that we've had\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nI single it out because it really spans\nfrom the basic to the applied\nand Dr. Jarvis's story is\nan especially unique one\nin terms of how he arrived\nat becoming a neurobiologist.\nSo for those of you that are interested\nin personal journey and personal story,\nDr. Jarvis's is truly a\nspecial and important one.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all, they ship internationally\nbecause we know that many of you\nare located outside of the United States.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none,\nboth in terms of purity and precision\nof the amounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single ingredient supplements,\nand that are supplied in\ndosages that allow you\nto build a supplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add\nthings and remove things\nfrom your protocol in a way\nthat's really systematic and scientific.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partner with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere, you'll see those supplements.\nAnd just keep in mind\nthat we are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better meet your immediate\nand long-term health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA test,\nyou can also get insight\ninto, for example,\nwhat your biological age is\nand compare that to\nyour chronological age.\nThe problem with a lot of DNA tests\nand blood tests, however,\nis you get information back\nabout metabolic factors, lipids,\nand hormones, and so forth,\nbut you don't know what to do\nwith or about that information.\nInsideTracker solves that\nproblem with a simple platform\nthat allows you to click\non any specific factor,\nlearn more about it and what\nit does in your brain and body,\nand also the various\nnutritional supplementation\nand other types of\ninterventions you can take\nto bring the levels of that factor\ninto the ranges that are\noptimal for you and your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThey also have some really unique features\nthat make them especially attractive\nfrom the standpoint of\naesthetics and performance.\nThe company was founded by two\nall-American swimmers from Stanford\nand everything about their\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance in mind.\nInitially, the eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed for sport,\nthat is for running and\nfor cycling, et cetera.\nAnd indeed, still their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses are very lightweight\nand they won't slip off\nyour face if you get sweaty,\nbut they also have a terrific aesthetic.\nYou can wear them to work.\nYou can wear them out to eat.\nI wear readers at night\nwhen I work, or if I drive\nand I wear sunglasses sometimes\nduring the middle of the day,\nif it's too bright and I need\nsunglasses in order to see.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses, or sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's ROKA.com\nand enter the code huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA.com\nand enter the code huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you\nneed and nothing you don't,\nmeaning no sugar, but\nplenty of the correct ratios\nof sodium, magnesium and potassium,\nand those three electrolytes,\nsodium, magnesium, and potassium\nare critical for your neuron,\nyour nerve cell function,\nand for the function of all the cells\nin your brain and body.\nI've mentioned this before on the podcast,\nbut I'm a fan of salt,\nnot taking too much salt,\nbut certainly not getting too little salt.\nLMNT has 1000 milligrams,\nthat is one gram of salt,\nwhich might sound like a lot of salt.\nBut for many people,\nespecially people who are\nfollowing low carbohydrate diets,\nor who are exercising or\nsweating a lot, or both,\nthat level of salt can actually help you\nin many circumstances.\nGetting the appropriate level of salt,\nand certainly the appropriate\nlevels of electrolytes\nwill improve your cognitive function\nand will improve your\nphysical performance.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's lmnt.com/huberman,\nand you'll get a free\nsample pack with your order.\nThat's drinklmnt.com/huberman.\nAnd now, for my discussion\nwith Dr. Erich Jarvis.\nErich, it's so great to have you here.\n- Thank you.\n- Yeah.\nVery interested in learning from you\nabout speech and language.\nAnd even as I ask the question,\nI realize that a lot of\npeople, including myself,\nprobably don't fully\nappreciate the distinction\nbetween speech and language, right?\nSpeech, I think of as the motor patterns,\nthe production of sound\nthat has meaning, hopefully.\nAnd language, of course,\ncomes in various languages\nand varieties of ways of communicating.\nBut in terms of the study\nof speech and language,\nand thinking about how the brain\norganizes speech and language,\nwhat are the similarities?\nWhat are the differences?\nHow should we think about\nspeech and language?\n- Yeah, well, I'm glad you,\nyou know, inviting me here.\nAnd I'm also glad to\nget that first question,\nwhich I consider a provocative one.\nThe reason why, I've been struggling,\nwhat is the difference\nwith speech and language\nfor many years.\nAnd realize, why am I struggling,\nis because there are behavioral terms,\nlet's call 'em psychologically,\npsychology developed kind of terms\nthat don't actually align\nexactly with brain function.\nAll right.\nAnd the question is there a distinction\nbetween speech and language?\nAnd when I look at the brain\nof work that other people\nhave done, work we have done,\nalso compared it with animal models,\nlike those who can imitate sounds\nlike parrots and songbirds.\nI start to see there really\nisn't such a sharp distinction.\nSo, to get at what I think is going on,\nlet me tell you how some\npeople think of it now.\nThat there's a separate\nlanguage module in the brain\nthat has all the\nalgorithms and computations\nthat influence the speech pathway\non how to produce sound\nand the auditory pathway\non how to perceive\nand interpret it for speech\nor for, you know, sound\nthat we call speech.\nAnd it turns out,\nI don't think there is any good evidence\nfor a separate language module.\nInstead, there is a\nspeech production pathway\nthat's controlling our larynx,\ncontrolling our jaw muscles\nthat has built within it\nall the complex algorithms\nfor spoken language.\nAnd there's the auditory pathway\nthat has built within it,\nall the complex algorithms\nfor understanding speech,\nnot separate from a language module.\nAnd this speech production pathway\nis specialized to humans\nand parrots and songbirds,\nwhereas this auditory perception pathway\nis more ubiquitous amongst\nthe animal kingdom.\nAnd this is why dogs can understand,\n\"sit\", \"sientese\", \"come here, boy\",\n\"get the ball\" and so forth.\nDogs can understand several\nhundred human speech words.\nGreat apes, you can teach\nthem for several thousand,\nbut they can't say a word.\n- Fascinating.\nBecause you've raised a\nnumber of animal species\nearly on here and because I have a,\nbasically an obsession with animals\nsince the time I was very small,\nI have to ask, which\nanimals have language?\nWhich animals have modes of communication\nthat are sort of like language.\n- [Erich] Yeah.\n- You know, I've heard whale songs.\nI don't know what they're saying.\nThey sound very beautiful,\nbut they could be insulting\neach other for all I know.\n- [Erich] Yeah.\n- And they very well may be.\nDolphins, birds, I mean,\nwhat do we understand about\nmodes of communication\nthat are like language,\nbut might not be what would\nclassically be called language?\n- Yes, right.\nSo, modes of communication\nthat people would define as language,\nmore, very, in a very narrow definition,\nthey would say, production\nof sound, so speech.\nBut what about the hands,\nthe gesturing with the hands?\nWhat about a bird who is doing\naerial displays in the air,\ncommunicating information\nthrough body language, right.\nWell, I'm going to go back to the brain.\nSo what I think is going on\nis for spoken language,\nwe're using the speech pathway\nand all the complex algorithms there.\nNext to the brain regions\nthat are controlling spoken language\nare the brain regions for\ngesturing with the hands.\nAnd that hand parallel pathway\nhas also complex algorithms\nthat we can utilize.\nAnd some species are more\nadvanced in these circuits,\nwhether it's sound or gesturing with hands\nand some are less advanced.\nNow, we, humans and a few others\nare the most advanced\nfor the speech sounds\nor the spoken language,\nbut a non-human primate\ncan produce gesturing\nin a more advanced form than\nthey could produce sound.\nI'm not sure I got that across clearly,\njust to say that humans\nare the most advanced\nat spoken language,\nbut not necessarily as big a\ndifference at gestural language\ncompared to some of the species.\n- Very clear and very interesting.\nAnd immediately prompts the question,\nhave there been brain imaging\nor other sorts of studies\nevaluating neural activity\nin the context of, you know,\ncultures and languages,\nat least that I associate\nwith a lot of hand movement,\nlike Italian.\n- Yep.\n- Versus, I don't know,\nmaybe you could give us\nsome examples of cultures\nwhere language is not associated with\nas much overt hand movement.\n- Yes, so as you and I\nare talking here today\nand people who are\nlistening, but can't see us,\nwe're actually gesturing\nwith our hands as we talk\nwithout knowing it or\ndoing it unconsciously.\nAnd if we were talking on a telephone,\nI would have one hand here\nand I'd be gesturing with the other hand.\n[Andrew laughs]\nWithout even you seeing me, right?\nAnd so why is that?\nSome have argued and I would agree,\nbut based upon what we've seen\nis that there's an\nevolutionary relationship\nbetween the brain pathways\nthat control speech\nproduction and gesturing.\nAnd the brain regions I mentioned\nare directly adjacent to each other.\nAnd why is that?\nI think that the brain\npathways that control speech\nevolved out of the brain pathways\nthat control body movement.\nAll right.\nAnd that\nwhen you talk about Italian, French,\nEnglish, and so forth,\neach one of those languages\ncome with a learned set of gestures\nthat you can communicate with.\nNow, how is that related to other animals?\nWell, Cocoa, a gorilla who is raised\nwith humans for 39 years or more,\nlearned how to do gesture communication,\nlearned how to sign\nlanguage, so to speak, right?\nBut Cocoa couldn't produce those sounds.\nCocoa could understand them as well\nby seeing somebody sign\nor hearing somebody produce speech,\nbut Cocoa couldn't\nproduce it with her voice.\nAnd so, what's going on there is that\na number of species, not all of them,\na number of species have\nmotor pathways in the brain\nwhere you can do learn gesturing,\nrudimentary language, if you\nwanted, say with your limbs,\neven if it's not as advanced as humans.\nBut they don't have this extra\nbrain pathway for the sound.\nSo they can't gesture with their voice\nin the way that they\ngesture with their hands.\n- I see.\nOne thing that I've wondered\nabout for a very long time\nis whether or not\nprimitive emotions and primitive sounds\nare the early substrate of language.\nAnd whether or not there's a bridge\nthat we can draw between those\nin terms of just the\nbasic respiration systems\nassociated with different\nextreme feelings.\nHere's the way I'm\nimagining this might work.\nWhen I smell something delicious,\nI typically inhale more.\n- Hmm hmm.\n- And I might say, mmm,\nor something like that.\nWhereas if I smell something putrid,\nI typically turn away, and I wince\nand I will exhale [exhales],\nyou know or sort of\nkind of like turn away,\ntrying to not ingest those molecules\nor inhale those molecules.\nI could imagine that these\nare the basic dark and light contrasts\nof the language system.\nAnd as I say that,\nI'm saying that from the\norientation of a vision scientist\nwho thinks of all visual images built up\nin a very basic way of\na hierarchical map model\nof the ability to see dark and light.\nSo I could imagine this kind of primitive\nto more sophisticated pyramid\nof sound to language.\nIs this a crazy idea?\nDo we have any evidence\nthis is the way it works?\n- No, it's not a crazy idea.\nAnd in fact,\nyou hit upon one of the key distinctions\nin the field of research\nthat I started out in,\nwhich is vocal learning research.\nSo for vocal communication,\nyou have most vertebrate species vocalize,\nbut most of them are\nproducing innate sounds\nthat they're born with producing,\nthat is babies crying, for example,\nor dogs barking.\nAnd only a few species have\nlearned vocal communication,\nthe ability to imitate sounds.\nAnd that is what makes\nspoken language special.\nWhen people think of what's\nspecial about language,\nit's the learned vocalizations.\nThat is what's rare.\nAnd so, this distinction\nbetween innateness and learned\nis more of a bigger dichotomy\nwhen it comes to vocalizations\nthan for other behaviors\nin the animal kingdom.\nAnd when you go in the brain,\nyou see it there as well.\nAnd so all the things you talked about,\nthe breathing, the grunting and so forth,\na lot of that is handled\nby the brain stem circuits,\nyou know, right around the\nlevel of your neck and below.\nLike a reflex kind of thing.\nSo, or even some emotional\naspects of your behavior\nin the hypothalamus and so forth.\nBut for a learned behavior,\nlearning how to speak,\nlearning how to play the piano,\nteaching a dog to learn how to do tricks\nis using the forebrain circuits.\nAnd what has happened is\nthat there's a lot of forebrain circuits\nthat are controlling,\nlearning how to move body\nparts in these species,\nbut not for the vocalizations.\nBut in humans and in parrots\nand in some other species,\nsomehow, we acquired circuits\nwhere the forebrain has\ntaken over the brain stem\nand now using that brain stem,\nnot only to produce the innate\nbehaviors or vocal behaviors,\nbut the learned ones as well.\n- Do we have any sense\nof when modern or\nsophisticated language evolved?\nYou know, thinking back to the\nspecies that we evolved from,\nand even within Homo sapiens,\nhas there been an evolution of language?\nHas there been a devolution\nof language? [laughs]\n- Yeah.\nYeah, I would say,\nand to be able to answer that question,\nit does come with the caveat\nthat I think we humans overrate ourselves\ncompared to other species.\nAnd so it makes even scientists go astray\nin trying to hypothesize\nwhen, you especially\ndon't find fossil evidence\nof language that easily\nout there in terms of\nwhat happened in the past.\nAmongst the primates,\nwhich we humans belong to,\nwe are the only ones that\nhave this advanced vocal learning ability.\nNow, it was assumed that\nit was only Homo sapiens,\nthen you can go back in time now\nbased upon genomic data,\nnot only of us living humans,\nbut of the fossils that have been found\nfor Homo sapiens, of Neanderthals,\nof Denisovan individuals\nand discover that our\nancestor, our human ancestors,\nsupposedly hybridized with\nthese other hominid species.\nAnd it was assumed that\nthese other hominid species\ndon't learn how to imitate sounds.\nI don't know of any species today\nthat's a vocal learner\nthat can have children\nwith a non-vocal learning species.\nI don't see it.\nDoesn't mean it didn't exist.\nAnd when we look at the genetic data\nfrom these ancestral\nhominids, that, you know,\nwhere we can look at\ngenes that are involved\nin learned vocal communication,\nthey have the same\nsequence as we humans do\nfor genes that function\nin speech circuits.\nSo I think Neanderthals\nhad spoken language.\nI'm not going to say it's as\nadvanced as what it is in humans.\nI don't know.\nBut I think it's been there for at least\nbetween 500,000 to a million years\nthat our ancestors had this ability\nand that we've been coming\nmore and more advanced with it\nculturally and possibly genetically.\nBut I think it's evolved sometime\nin the last 500,000 to a million years.\n- Incredible.\nMaybe we could talk a little bit more\nabout the overlap between brain circuits\nthat control language and speech\nin humans and other animals.\nI was weaned in the neuroscience era\nwhere birdsong and the ability of birds\nto learn their tooter song\nwas and still is a prominent field,\nsubfield of neuroscience.\nAnd then of course,\nneuroimaging of humans speaking\nand learning, et cetera,\nand this notion of a critical period,\na time in which language\nis learned more easily\nthan it is later in life.\nAnd the names of the different brain areas\nwere quite different.\nIf one opens the textbooks,\nwe hear Wernicke's and\nBroca's for the humans.\nAnd you look at the birds of it,\nI remember, you know.\n- HVC.\n- Robustus, striatum.\nArea X.\n- That's right.\nThat's right, yes.\n- Et cetera.\nBut for most of our listeners,\nthose names won't mean a whole lot,\nbut in terms of homologies\nbetween areas in terms of\nfunction, what do we know?\nAnd how similar or different\nare the brain areas\ncontrolling speech and language\nin say a songbird and a young human child?\n- Yeah, so, going back to the 1950s\nor even a little earlier,\nand Peter Muller and others who\ngot involved in neurotology,\nthe study of neurobiology of behavior\nin a natural way, right.\nYou know, they start to\nfind that behaviorally,\nthere are these species of birds\nlike songbirds and parrots,\nand now we also know\nhummingbirds, just three of them\nout of the 40-something bird\ngroups out there on the planet,\norders, that they can\nimitate sounds like we do.\nAnd so that was a similarity.\nIn other words, they had\nthis kind of behavior\nthat's more similar to us\nthan chimpanzees have with us\nor than chickens have with them, right,\ntheir closer relatives.\nAnd then they discovered\neven more similarities,\nthese critical periods\nthat if you remove a child,\nyou know, this unfortunately\nhappens where a child is feral\nand is not raised with human\nand goes through their\npuberty phase of growth,\nit becomes hard for them to\nlearn a language as an adult.\nSo there's this critical\nperiod where you learn best.\nAnd even later on, when\nyou're in regular society,\nit's hard to learn.\nWell, the birds undergo these same thing.\nAnd then it was discovered\nthat if they become deaf,\nwe humans become deaf,\nour speech starts to deteriorate\nwithout any kind of therapy.\nIf a non-human primate or, you know,\nor let's say a chicken becomes deaf,\ntheir vocalizations don't deteriorate.\nvery little at least.\nWell, this happens in\nthe vocal learning birds.\nSo there were all these\nbehavioral parallels\nthat came along with a package,\nand then people looked into the brain.\nFernando Nottebohm, my former PhD advisor,\nand began to discover the\nArea X you talked about,\nthe robust nucleus of the archipallium.\nAnd these brain pathways were not found\nin the species who couldn't imitate\nso there was a parallel here.\nAnd then jumping many\nyears later, you know,\nI started to dig down\ninto these brain circuits\nto discover that these brain circuits\nhad parallel functions with\nthe brain circuits for humans,\neven though they're by a different name,\nlike Broca's laryngeal motor cortex.\nAnd most recently,\nwe discovered not only\nthe actual circuitry\nand the connectivity are similar,\nbut the underlying\ngenes that are expressed\nin these brain regions\nin a specialized way,\ndifferent from the rest of the brain,\nare also similar between humans,\nand songbirds and parrots.\nSo all the way down to the genes.\nAnd now we're finding\nthe specific mutations\nare also similar, not always\nidentical, but similar,\nwhich indicates remarkable convergence\nfor a so-called complex behavior\nin species separated by 300 million years\nfrom a common ancestor.\nAnd not only that,\nwe are discovering that\nmutations in these genes\nthat cause speech deficits\nin humans, like in FOXP2,\nif you put those same mutations\nor similar type of deficits\nin these vocal learning birds,\nyou get similar deficits.\nSo convergence of the behavior\nis associated with\nsimilar genetic disorders\nof the behavior.\n- Incredible.\nI have to ask, do hummingbird\nsing, or do they hum?\n- Hummingbirds hum with their wings\nand sing with their syrinx.\n- In a coordinated way?\n- In a coordinated way.\nThere's some species of\nhummingbirds that actually will,\nDoug Ashler showed this,\nthat will flap their wings\nand create a slapping\nsound with their wings\nthat's in unison with their song\nand you would not know it,\nbut it sounds like a particular\nsyllable in their songs,\neven though it's their wings\nand their voice at the same time.\n- Hummingbirds are clapping to their song?\n- Clapping with their,\nthey're snapping their wings together\nin unison with a song to make it like,\nif I'm going ba, da, da,\nda [bangs], but, da [bangs]\nand I banged on the table\nexcept they make it almost\nsound like their voice\nwith their wings.\n- Incredible.\n- Yes.\n- I, I'm...\n- And they got some of the\nsmallest brains around.\n- As the kids would say mind blown, right?\n- Yes. Yes.\n- Incredible.\n- Yes.\n- Incredible, I love hummingbirds.\nAnd I always feel like\nit's such a special thing\nto get a moment to see one\nbecause they move around so fast\nand they fled away so fast in\nthese ballistic trajectories.\n- [Erich] Yep.\n- That when you get to see\none stationary for a moment,\nor even just hovering there,\nyou feel like you're extracting so much\nfrom their little microcosm of life,\nbut now I realize they're\nplaying music essentially.\n- Right, exactly.\nAnd what's amazing about hummingbirds\nand I'm going to say, vocal\nlearning species in general,\nis that for whatever reason,\nthey seem to evolve\nmultiple complex traits.\nYou know, this idea that\nthe evolving language,\nspoken language in particular,\ncomes along with a set of specializations.\n- Incredible.\n- Yeah.\n- When I was coming up in neuroscience,\nI learned that I think it\nwas the work of Peter Muller\nthat young birds learn,\nsongbirds learned their tooter\nsong and learn it quite well,\nbut that they could learn\nthe song of another tooter.\nIn other words, they\ncould learn a different,\nand for the listeners,\nI'm doing air quotes here,\n\"a different language\",\n\"a different bird song\",\ndifferent than their own species song.\nBut never as well as they could learn\ntheir own natural genetically linked song.\n- Yes.\n- Genetically linked,\nmeaning that it would be like\nme being raised in a different culture,\nand that I would learn the other language,\nbut not as well as I would\nhave learned English.\nThis is the idea.\n- Yes.\n- Is that true?\n- That is true, yes.\nAnd that's what I learned\ngrowing up as well.\nAnd talked to Peter Muller\nhimself about before he passed.\nYeah, he used to call it the\ninnate predisposition to learn.\nAll right.\nSo which would be kind of the equivalent\nin the linguistic community\nof universal grammar.\nThere is something genetically\ninfluencing our vocal communication\non top of what we learned culturally.\nAnd so there's this balance\nbetween the genetic control of speech\nor a song in these birds\nand the learned cultural control.\nAnd so, yes, if you were to take,\nyou know, I mean, in this case,\nwe actually tried this\nat Rockefeller later on.\nTake a zebra finch and\nraise it with a canary,\nit would sing a song\nthat was sort of like a hybrid in between.\nWe call it a can-inch, right?\n[both laughing]\nAnd vice versa for the canary,\nbecause there's something different\nabout their vocal musculature\nor the circuitry in the brain.\nAnd with a zebra finch, even\nwith a closely related species,\nif you would take a zebra\nfinch, a young animal,\nand in one cage next to\nit placed its own species,\nadult male, right.\nAnd in the other cage placed\na Bengalese finch next to it,\nit would preferably learn the song\nfrom its own species neighbor.\nBut if you remove its neighbor,\nit would learn that\nBengalese finch very well.\n- [Andrew] Fantastic.\n- It has something to do\nwith also the social bonding\nwith your own species.\n- Incredible.\nThat raises a question that I,\nbased on something I also heard,\nbut I don't have any scientific\npeer-reviewed publication to point to,\nwhich is this idea of Pidgin not the bird,\nbut this idea of when multiple cultures\nand languages converge in\na given geographic area,\nthat the children of all the\ndifferent native languages\nwill come up with their own language.\nI think this was in island culture,\nmaybe in Hawaii, called Pidgin,\nwhich is sort of a hybrid\nof the various languages\nthat their parents speak at home\nand that they themselves speak.\nAnd that somehow Pidgin\nagain, not the bird,\nbut a language called Pidgin,\nfor reasons, I don't know,\nharbors certain basic\nelements of all language.\nIs that true?\nIs that not true?\n- I would say, I haven't\nstudied enough myself\nin terms of Pidgin, specifically,\nbut in terms of cultural\nevolution of language\nand hybridization between\ndifferent cultures and so forth,\neven amongst birds with different dialects\nand you bring them together, you know,\nwhat is going on here\nis cultural evolution\nremarkably tracks genetic evolution.\nSo if you bring people\nfrom two separate populations together\nthat have been in their\nseparate populations,\nevolutionarily, at least\nfor hundreds of generations,\nso someone's speaking Chinese,\nsomeone's speaking English,\nand that child is then\nlearning from both of them.\nYes, that child's going\nto be able to pick up\nand merge phonemes and words together\nin a way that an adult\nwouldn't, because, why?\nThey're experiencing both\nlanguages at the same time\nduring their critical period years,\nin a way that adults would\nnot be able to experience.\nAnd so you get a hybrid.\nAnd the lowest common denominator\nis going to be what they share.\nAnd so the phonemes\nthat they've re retained\nin each of their languages\nis what's going to be,\nI imagine, used the most.\n- Interesting.\nSo we've got brain circuits\nin songbirds and in humans\nthat in many ways are similar,\nperhaps not in their exact wiring,\nbut in their basic contour of wiring.\nAnd genes that are expressed\nin both sets of neural circuits\nin very distinct species\nthat are responsible for these phenomenon\nwe're calling speech and language.\nWhat sorts of things are\nthose genes controlling?\nI could imagine they were\ncontrolling the wiring\nof connections between brain areas.\nYou know, essentially a map\nof, you know, of a circuit,\nbasically like an engineer\nwould design a circuit\nfor speech and language,\nnature designed the circuit\nfor speech and language,\nbut presumably other things too.\nLike the ability to connect motor patterns\nwithin the throat of\nmuscles within the throat,\nor in the control of the tongue.\nI mean, what are these genes doing?\n- You're pretty good, yeah.\nYou've made some very good\nguesses there that makes sense.\nSo, yes, one of the things that differ\nin the speech pathways of us\nand these song pathways of birds\nis some of the connections\nare fundamentally different\nthan the surrounding circuits,\nlike a direct cortical connection\nfrom the areas that control\nvocalizations in the cortex\nor the motor neurons\nthat control the larynx,\nin humans or the syrinx in birds.\nAnd so we actually made a prediction\nthat since some of these\nconnections differ,\nwe're going to find genes that\ncontrol neural connectivity,\nand that specialize in\nthat function, that differ.\nAnd that's exactly what we found.\nGenes that control what\nwe call axon guidance\nand form neuronal connections,\nand what was interesting,\nit was sort of in the opposite\ndirection that we expected.\nThat is, some of these genes,\nactually, a number of them\nthat control neural\nconnectivity were turned off\nin the speech circuit, all right.\nAnd it didn't make sense to us at first\nuntil we started to realize the function\nof these genes are to repel\nconnections from forming,\nso repulsive molecules.\nAnd so when you turn them off,\nthey allow certain connections to form\nthat normally would have not formed.\nSo by turning it off,\nyou gain a function for speech, right?\nOther genes that surprised us\nwere genes involved in calcium\nbuffering neuroprotection,\nlike Parvalbumin or heat-shock proteins,\nso when your brain gets\nhot, these proteins turn on.\nAnd we couldn't figure\nout for a long time,\nwhy is that the case?\nAnd then the idea popped\nto me one day and said, ah,\nwhen I heard the larynx is\nthe fastest firing muscles\nin the body, all right.\nIn order to vibrate sound\nand modulate sound in the way we do,\nyou have to control,\nyou have to move those muscles, you know,\nthree to four to five times faster\nthan just regular walking or running.\nAnd so when you stick electrodes\nin the brain areas that\ncontrol learned vocalizations\nin these birds and I\nthink in humans as well,\nthose neurons are firing at a higher rate\nto control these muscles.\nAnd so what is that going to do?\nYou're going to have lots of\ntoxicity in those neurons,\nunless you upregulate molecules\nthat take out the extra load\nthat is needed to control the larynx.\nAnd then finally, a third set of genes\nthat are specialized\nin these speech circuit\nare involved in neuroplasticity.\nNeuroplasticity, meaning\nallowing the brain circuits\nto be more flexible so\nyou can learn better.\nAnd why is that?\nI think learning how to produce speech\nis a more complex learning ability\nthan say learning how to walk\nor learning how to do tricks\nand jumps and so forth that dogs do.\n- Yeah, it's interesting as you say that,\nbecause I realize that\nmany aspects of speech\nare sort of reflexive.\nI'm not thinking about\neach word I'm going to say,\nthey just sort of roll out of my mouth,\nhopefully with some forethought.\nWe both know people that\nseem to speak, think less,\nfewer synapses between\ntheir brain and their mouth\nthan others, right.\n- Yes.\n- A lot of examples out there,\nand some people are very\ndeliberate in their speech,\nbut nonetheless, that much\nof speech has to be precise.\nAnd some of it less precise.\nIn terms of plasticity of speech\nand the ability to learn\nmultiple languages,\nbut even just one language,\nwhat's going on in the critical period,\nthe so-called critical period?\n- Yeah.\n- Why is it that, so my\nniece speaks Spanish.\nShe's Guatemalan and speaks Spanish\nand English incredibly well.\nShe's 14-years-old.\nI've struggled with Spanish my whole life.\nMy father is bilingual.\nMy mother is not.\nI've tried to learn Spanish as an adult.\nIt's really challenging.\nI'm told that had I learned\nit when I was eight,\nI would be better off.\n- That's right.\n- Or it would be installed within me.\nSo the first question is,\nis it easier to learn multiple languages\nwithout an accent early in life?\nAnd if so, why?\nAnd then the second question is\nif one can already speak\nmore than one language\nas a consequence of childhood learning,\nis it easier to acquire\nnew languages later on?\n- So, the answer to both of\nthose questions is yes, in that,\nbut to explain this, I\nneed to let you know,\nactually the entire brain\nis undergoing a critical\nperiod development,\nnot just the speech pathways.\nAnd so it's easier to\nlearn how to play a piano.\nIt's easier to learn how to ride a bike\nfor the first time and so forth\nas a young child than it is later in life.\nWhat I mean easier in\nterms of when you start\nfrom first principles\nof learning something.\nSo the very first time,\nif you're going to\nlearn Chinese as a child\nversus the very first time\nyou learn Chinese as an adult\nor learning to play piano\nas a child versus an adult.\nBut the speech pathways,\nor let's say speech behavior,\nI think has a stronger critical period\nchange to it than other circuits.\nAnd why, what's going on there in general?\nWhy do you need a critical period\nto make you more stable,\nto make you more stubborn, so to speak?\nThe reason I believe is\nthat the brain is not for,\nthe brain can only hold\nso much information.\nAnd if you are undergoing\nrapid learning to learn,\nto acquire new knowledge,\nyou also have to, you know, dumb stuff.\nPut in memory or information in the trash,\nlike in a computer.\nYou only have so many gigabases of memory.\nAnd so therefore, plus also for survival,\nyou don't want to keep forgetting things.\nAnd so the brain is designed, I believe,\nto undergo this critical period\nand solidify the circuits with\nwhat you learned as a child\nand you use that for\nthe rest of your life.\nAnd we humans stay even more\nplastic in our brain functions\ncontrolled by a gene called srGAP2.\nWe have an extra copy of it\nthat leads our speech circuit\nand other brain regions\nin a more immature state throughout life\ncompared to other animals.\nSo we're more immature.\nWe're still juvenile like\ncompared to other animals.\n- I knew it.\n- But we still go through\nthe critical periods\nlike they all do.\nAnd now the question you asked about,\nif you learn more languages as a child,\nis it easier to learn as an adult?\nAnd that's a common finding\nout there in the literature.\nThere's some that argue against it.\nBut for those that support\nit, the idea there is,\nyou are born with a set of innate sounds\nyou can produce of phonemes.\nAnd you narrow that down\nbecause not all languages use all of them.\nAnd so you narrow down the ones\nyou use to string the phonemes together,\nin words that you learn\nand you maintain those\nphonemes as an adult.\nAnd here comes along another language\nthat's using those phonemes\nor in different combinations\nyou're not used to.\nAnd therefore, it's like\nstarting from first principles,\nbut if you already have them\nin multiple languages that you're using,\nthen it makes it easier to use them\nin another third or fourth language.\n- I see, incredible.\n- So, it's not like your brain\nhas maintained greater plasticity,\nit's your brain has\nmaintained greater ability\nto produce different sounds\nthat then allows you to learn\nanother language faster.\n- Got it.\nAre the hand gestures\nassociated with sounds\nor with meanings of words?\n- I think the hand gestures are associated\nwith both the sounds and the meaning.\nWhen I say sound like if\nyou are really angry, right,\nand you are making a loud\nscreaming noise, right,\nyou may make hand gestures\nthat look like you're going\nto beat the wall, right?\nBecause you're making loud\nsounds and loud gestures, right.\nBut if you want to explain\nsomething like, come over here,\nwhat I just do now to you\nfor those who can't see me,\nI swung my hand towards you\nand swung it here to me.\nThat has a meaning to it, to come here.\nSo just like with the voice,\nthe hand gestures are\nproducing both, you know,\nboth qualities of sound.\n- And for people that\nspeak multiple languages,\nespecially those that learn\nthose multiple languages\nearly in development,\ndo they switch their\npatterns of motor movements\naccording to let's say,\ngoing from Italian to Arabic\nor from Arabic to French\nin a way that matches\nthe precision of language\nthat they're speaking?\n- You know what?\nYou just asked me a question,\nI don't know the answer to.\nI would imagine that would\nmake sense because of switching\nin terms of sometimes people\nmight call this code switching,\neven different dialects\nof the same language.\nCould you do that with your gestures?\nI imagine so, but I really don't\nknow if that's true or not.\n- Okay, well, I certainly don't\nknow from my own experience\nbecause I only speak one language.\n[both laughing]\nBefore we continue with\ntoday's discussion,\nI'd like to just briefly\nacknowledge our sponsor,\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1.\nAthletic Greens, aka AGI,\nis an all-in-one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink\nthat also has adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since way back in 2012\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still drink\nAthletic Greens twice a day\nis that it supplies\ntotal foundational coverage\nof my vitamin mineral needs\nand it supplies important\nnutrients that I need\nto support my gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome, as many of you know,\nsupports the immune system\nand it also supports the\nso-called gut brain access,\nwhich is vital for\nmood, for energy levels,\nfor regulating focus\nand many other features\nof our mental health\nand physical health that\nimpact our daily performance\nand high performance in any endeavors\nwe might be involved in.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away\nfive free travel packs,\nplus a year's supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 with every order.\nAnd of course, vitamin D3 K2\nare vital for all sorts of\nthings like hormone health\nand metabolic health\nand K2 for cardiovascular\nhealth and calcium regulation.\nAgain, you can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nTo go a little bit into the\nabstract, but not too far,\nwhat about modes of speech and language\nthat seem to have a depth\nof emotionality and meaning,\nbut for which it departs\nfrom structured language.\nHere's what I mean, poetry.\n- Hmm hmm.\n- I think of musicians,\nlike there's some Bob\nDylan songs that, to me,\nI understand the individual words.\nI like to think there's an\nemotion associated with it.\nat least, I experience\nsome sort of emotion\nand I have a guess about\nwhat he was experiencing.\nBut if I were to just read\nit linearly without the music\nand without him singing it, or\nsomebody singing it like him,\nit wouldn't hold any meaning.\nSo in other words, words\nthat seem to have meaning,\nbut not associated with language,\nbut somehow tap into an emotionality.\n- Yep, absolutely.\nSo, we call this difference\nsemantic communication,\ncommunication with meaning\nand effective communication,\ncommunication that has more\nof an emotional feeling content to it,\nyou know, but not with,\nyou know, the semantics.\nAnd the two can be mixed up,\nlike with singing words that have meaning,\nbut also have this effect of emotional,\nyou just love the sound of the\nsinger that you're hearing.\nAnd initially, you know,\npsychologists, scientists, in general,\nthought that these were\ngoing to be controlled\nby different brain circuits.\nAnd it is the case.\nThere are emotional brain\ncenters in the hypothalamus,\nin the cingulate cortex and so forth,\nthat do give tone to the sounds.\nBut I believe, you know,\nbased upon imaging work\nand work we see in birds,\nwhen birds are communicating\nsemantic information\nin their sounds, which is not\ntoo often, but it happens,\nversus effective communication,\nsing because I'm trying\nto attract the mate,\nmy courtship song or defend my territory,\nit's the same brain circuits.\nIt's the same speech-like or song,\ncircuits are being used in different ways.\n- A friend of mine, who's\nalso a therapist, said to me,\nyou know, it's possible to say,\nI love you with intense hatred\nthan to say, I hate you with intense love.\n- [Eric] Right.\n- And reminding me that\nit's possible to hear\nboth of those statements in either way.\nSo I guess it's not just\nlimited to song or poetry.\nIt also, there's something\nabout the intention\nand the emotional context\nin which something spoken\nthat it can heavily shape the way\nthat we interpret what we hear.\n- That's right.\nAnd I consider all of\nthat actually, meaning,\neven though I defined it as,\npeople commonly do semantic\nand effective communication.\nEffective communication\nto say, I hate you,\nbut meant love, right,\ndoes have emotional\nmeaning to it, you know?\nAnd so, you know, one's more\nlike an object kind of meaning\nor an abstract kind of meaning.\nThere's several other points here\nI think it's important for those\nlistening out there to hear\nis that when I say also\nthis effective and semantic communication\nbeing used by similar brain circuits,\nit also matters, the side of the brain.\nIn birds and in humans,\nthere's left-right dominance\nfor learned communication,\nlearned sound communication.\nSo the left in us humans is\nmore dominant for speech,\nbut the right has a\nmore balance for singing\nor processing musical sounds\nas opposed to processing speech.\nBoth get used for both reasons.\nAnd so when people say your right brain\nis your artistic brain\nand your left brain is\nyour thinking brain,\nthis is what they're referring to.\nAnd so that's another distinction.\nA second thing that's useful to know\nis that all vocal learning species\nuse their learned sounds\nfor this emotional\neffective kind of communication,\nbut only a few of them like humans\nand some parrots and dolphins\nuse it for the semantic\nkind of communication,\nwe're calling speech.\nAnd that has led a number\nof people to hypothesize\nthat the evolution of\nspoken language, of speech,\nevolved first for singing,\nfor this more like emotional\nkind of mate attraction\nlike the Jennifer Lopez,\nthe Ricky Martin kind\nof songs and so forth.\nAnd then later on,\nit became used for abstract communication\nlike we're doing now.\n- Oh, interesting.\nWell, that's a perfect segue for me\nto be able to ask you\nabout your background\nand motor control, not only\nof the hands but of the body.\nSo you have a number of important\ndistinctions to your name,\nbut one of them is that you were a member\nof the Alvin Ailey Dance School,\nSchool of Dance.\n- That's right.\nThat's right, hmm hmm.\n- So you're an accomplished\nand quite able dancer, right?\nTell us a little bit about your background\nin the world of dance\nand how it informs your\ninterest in neuroscience,\n[clears throat], excuse me,\nand perhaps even how it relates\nspecifically to your work\non speech and language.\n- Yes, well, it's interesting.\nAnd then this kind of history\neven goes before my time.\nSo in my family, my\nmother and father's side,\nthey both went to the High\nSchool of Music and Art\nhere in New York City.\nAnd particularly, in my mother's family,\ngoing back multiple\ngenerations, they were singers.\nAnd I even did my family genealogy\nand found out not only, you know,\nwe have some relationships\nto some well-known singers,\ndistant relationships\nlike Thelonious Monk,\nbut going back to the plantations\nin North Carolina and so forth,\nmy ancestors were singers in the church\nfor the, you know, the towns and so forth.\nAnd this somehow got passed on\nmultiple generations to my family.\nAnd I thought I was going to grow up\nand be a famous singer, right.\nAnd me and my brothers and sister\nformed a band when we\nwere kids and so forth.\nBut it turned out that I didn't inherit\nthe singing talents of some\nof my other family members,\neven though, you know,\nI was, you know, okay.\nYou know, but not like my brother,\nor not like my mother or my\naunts and my cousin Pura Fe',\nwho's now a talented\nNative American singer.\nAnd so,\nthat then influenced\nme to do other things.\nAnd I started, you know,\ncompeting in dance contests,\nyou know, actually this is around the time\nof Saturday Night Fever\nand I was as a teenager.\nAnd I started winning dance contests.\nAnd I thought, oh, I can dance.\nAnd I auditioned for the High\nSchool of Performing Arts.\nAnd I got in, here in New York City,\nand got into ballet\ndance and got in, right.\nAnd thought, if I learned ballet,\nI can learn everything else.\nIt I that idea, if you\nlearn something classical,\nit can teach for everything else.\nAnd I was, yeah, at\nAlvin Ailey Dance School,\nJoffrey Ballet Dance School.\nAnd at the end of my senior concert,\nI had this opportunity to audition\nfor the Alvin Ailey Dance Company.\nAnd I had an opportunity to go to college.\nAnd I also fell in love\nwith another passion\nthat my father had, which was science.\nAnd so I liked science in high school.\nAnd I found an overlap also\nbetween the arts and sciences,\nyou know, both required\ncreativity, hard work, discipline,\nyou know, new discovery,\nboth weren't boring to me.\nAnd the one decision I made\nat that senior dance concert\nwas, you know, when talking\nto the Alvin Ailey recruiter\nand thinking about it,\nI have to make a decision.\nAnd I thought something\nmy mother taught me\nbecause she was growing up in\nthe 1960s cultural revolution,\n\"Do something that has a\npositive impact on society.\"\nAnd I thought that I could do that better\nas a dancer than a scientist.\nSo now jump, I get into\ncollege, undergraduate school,\nI major in molecular\nbiology and mathematics.\nI decide I want to be a biologist,\ngot into graduate school,\nwanted to study the brain at, you know,\nat the Rockefeller University.\nSo I went from Hunter College\nto Rockefeller University.\nAnd so now I got to the brain\nand why did I choose the brain\nis because it controls dancing. [laughs]\nBut there wasn't anybody studying dancing.\nAnd I wanted study the brain,\nsomething that it does\nthat's really interesting and complex.\nAnd I thought, ah,\nlanguage is what it does.\nYou couldn't study that in mice.\nYou couldn't study in non-human primates.\nBut these birds do this wonderful thing\nthat Fernando Nottebohm was\nstudying at Rockefeller.\nAnd so that's what got me into the birds.\nAnd then jumping now, 15 years later,\nyou know, yeah, that's right.\nEven after I'm into now having my own lab,\nstudying vocal learning in these birds\nas a model for language and humans,\nit turns out that, you know,\nAni Patel and, you know, others,\nhave discovered that only\nvocal learning species\ncan learn how to dance.\n- Is that right?\n- That's right, yes.\n- So I've seen these just scrolling\nthrough the files here in my mind.\nI think about, every once\nin a while someone will,\nI love parrots.\n- Yes.\n- So every once in a while,\nsomeone will send me one\nof these little Instagram\nor Twitter videos of a parrot\ndoing what looks to me like dance,\ntypically it's a cockatoo.\n- That's right.\n- Right.\n- That's right.\n- Even foot stomping to the sound and-\n- Famous one called Snowball out there,\nbut there are many Snowballs\nout there. [laughs]\n- All the dancing birds\nare named Snowball?\nThat's an interesting tactic.\nSo only animals with language dance?\n- Yeah, vocal learning in particular,\nthe ability to imitate sounds, yes.\n- Incredible.\n- Yes.\nAnd this now is bringing\nmy life full circle, right.\nAnd so when that was discovered in 2009,\nat that same time in my lab at Duke,\nwe had discovered that vocal\nlearning brain pathways\nin songbirds, as well as in humans\nand in parrots, right, like Snowball,\nare embedded within circuits\nthat control learning how to move.\nAnd that led us to a theory\ncalled the Brain Pathway\nor Motor Theory of Vocal Learning Origin\nwhere the brain pathways for\nvocal learning and speech\nevolved by a whole duplication\nof the surrounding motor circuits\ninvolving learning how to move.\nNow, how does that explain dance, right?\nWell, when Snowball, the\ncockatoos, are dancing,\nthey're using the brain regions\naround their speech-like circuits\nto do this dancing behavior.\nAnd so what's going on there?\nWhat we hypothesize and now like to test\nis that when this,\nwhen speech evolved in humans\nand the equivalent behavior\nand parrots and songbirds,\nit required a very tight integration\nin the brain regions that can hear sound\nwith the brain regions\nthat control your muscles\nfrom moving your larynx\nand tongue and so forth\nfor producing sound.\nAnd that tight auditory motor integration,\nwe argue, then contaminated\nthe surrounding brain regions.\nAnd that contamination of\nthe surrounding brain regions\nnow allows us humans, in\nparticular, and parrots.\nto coordinate our muscle\nmovements of the rest of the body\nwith sound in the same way\nwe do for speech sounds.\n- [Andrew] Well.\n- So we're speaking with\nour bodies when we dance.\n- Incredible.\nAnd I have to say that\nas poor as I am at speaking\nmultiple languages,\nI'm even worse at dancing, so.\n- But I guarantee you're\nbetter than a monkey.\n- But not Snowball, the cockatoo?\n- No, maybe not Snowball.\nOn YouTube, we have a video\nwhere there's some scientists\ndancing with Snowball\nand you'll see Snowballs doing better\nthan some of the scientists.\n- Okay, well, as long as I'm not the worst\nof all scientists dancing.\n- I don't think so.\n- There's always a neuroplasticity.\nMay it save me someday.\nYou said something incredible\nthat I completely believe\neven though I have minimum to,\nlet's just say minimum dancing ability.\nOkay, I can get by at a party or wedding\nwithout complete embarrassment,\nbut I don't have any structured training.\nSo the body clearly can\ncommunicate with movement.\nAs a trained dancer and\nknowing other trained dancers,\nI always think of dance\nand bodily movement\nand communication through bodily movement\nas a form of wordlessness,\nlike a state of wordlessness.\nIn fact, the few times when I think\nthat maybe I'm actually\ndancing modestly well\nfor the context that I'm in,\nor I see other people dancing\nand they seem to just be\nvery much in the movement,\nit's almost like a state of non-language,\nnon-spoken language.\n- Hmm hmm.\n- And yet what you're telling me is\nthat there's a direct bridge at some level\nbetween the movement of\nthe body and language.\nSo is there a language of the body\nthat is distinct from\nthe language of speech?\nAnd if so, or if not, how do\nthose map onto one another?\nWhat does that Venn diagram look like?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nSo, let me define first\ndance in this context\nof vocal learning species.\nThis is the kind of dancing\nthat we are specialized in doing\nand the vocal learning species\nare specialized in doing\nis synchronizing body movements of muscles\nto the rhythmic beats of music.\nAnd for some reason, we like doing that.\nWe like synchronizing to sound\nand doing it together\nas a group of people.\nAnd that kind of communication\namongst ourselves\nis more like the effective\nkind of communication\nI mentioned earlier,\nunlike the semantic kind.\nSo we, humans, are using our voices more\nfor the semantic, abstract communication,\nbut we're using learned dance\nfor the effective emotional\nbonding kind of communication.\nIt doesn't mean we can't\ncommunicate semantic information\nin dance, and we do it,\nbut it's not as popular.\nYou know, like a ballet that,\nyou know, in the Nutcracker,\nit is popular, you know,\nwhere they are communicating,\nyou know, the Arabian guy comes out,\nwhich I was the Arabian guy\nin the ballet Nutcracker.\nThat's how I remember.\n- Oh, yeah?\n- Yeah, for the\nWestchester Ballet Company,\nwhen I was a teenager.\nYou know, we're trying\nto communicate meaning\nand our ballet dancing, it can go on\nwith a whole story and so forth.\nBut people don't interpret\nthat as clearly as speech.\nYou know, they're seeing the ballet\nwith semantic communication,\nwith a lot of emotional content,\nwhereas you go out to a club, you know,\nyeah, you're not communicating,\nokay, how you're feeling today?\nTell me about your day and so forth.\nYou're trying to synchronize\nwith other people\nin an effective way.\nAnd I think that's because,\nthe dance brain circuit\ninherited the more ancient\npart of the speech circuit,\nwhich was for singing.\n- I always had the feeling\nthat with certain forms of\nmusic, in particular opera,\nbut any kind of music where\nthere's some long notes sung\nthat at some level,\nthere was a literal resonance created\nbetween the singer and the listener.\nOr I think of like the\ndeep voice of a Johnny Cash\nor where at some level,\nyou can almost feel the\nvoice in your own body.\nAnd in theory, that could\nbe the vibration of the\nor the firing of the phrenic nerve\ncontrolling the diaphragm for all I know.\nIs there any evidence that\nthere's a coordination\nbetween performer and audience\nat the level of mind and body?\n- I'm going to say, possibly, yes.\nAnd the reason why is\nbecause I just came back from a conference\non the neurobiology of dance-\n- Clearly, I'm going\nto the wrong meetings.\n- Yeah, a colleague invited me.\n- You know, vision science\nsounds be so boring.\n- Yes, well, one of my colleagues,\nTecumseh Fitch and Jonathan Fritz,\nthey organized, well, a particular section\non this conference in Virginia.\nAnd this is the first\ntime I was in the room\nwith so many neuroscientists\nstudying the neurobiology of dance.\nIt's a new field now,\nin the last five years.\nAnd there was one lab\nwhere they were putting EEG\nelectrodes on the dancers,\non two different dancers\npartnering with each other,\nas well as the audience,\nyou know, seeing the dance\nand some, you know, argued,\nokay, if you're listening\nto the music as well,\nhow are you responding\n'cause you're asking\na question about music\nand I'm giving you an answer about dance.\nAnd what they found is\nthat, you know, the dancers,\nwhen they resonated with\neach other during the dance,\nor the audience listening to\nthe dancers and the music,\nthere's some resonance going on there\nthat they've score as higher resonance.\nTheir brain activity with\nthese wireless EEG signals\nare showing something different.\nAnd so that's why I say possibly, yes.\nIt needs more rigorous study\nand you know, this is\nsome stuff they publish,\nbut it's not prime time yet,\nbut they're trying to figure this out.\n- Love it.\nSo at least if I can't dance well,\nmaybe I can hear and feel\nwhat it is to dance in a certain way.\n- Yes, that's right.\nAnd this will be, some\npeople will think that they,\neven songs that they hear\nand they can almost sing to\nthemselves in their own head\nand they know what they\nwant it to sound like.\nAnd you know when it really sounds good,\nwhat it sounds like,\nbut they can't get their voice to do it.\n- I'm raising, for those listening,\nI'm raising my hand.\nNo musical ability.\nOthers in my household have\ntremendous musical ability\nwith instruments and\nwith voice, but not me.\n- Yeah, well, and so this\nis one of my selfish goals\nof trying to find the genetics\nof why can some people who\nsing really well and some not.\nIs there some genetic\npredisposition to that?\nAnd then can I modify my own muscles\nof brain circuits to sing better?\n- You're still after the sing.\nI guess this is what happens\nwhen siblings vary in proficiency\nis that competitiveness amongst brothers\nand sisters never goes away.\n- I've been trying to be\nas good as my brother,\nMark and Victor, you\nknow, for my entire life.\n- Well, watch out, Mark and Victor,\nhe's coming for you with\nneuroscience to back him.\nEarlier, you said that you\ndiscovered that you could dance.\nThat caught my ear.\nIt sounds like you\ndidn't actually have to,\nI'm not suggesting you\ndidn't work hard at it.\nBut at the moment where you discovered it,\nit just sort of was a skill that you had,\nthat up until that point,\nyou didn't target a life\nin the world of dance,\nbut the fact that you quote, unquote,\n\"discovered that you\ncould dance really well\"\nand then went to this\nincredible school of dance\nand did well,\ntells me that perhaps there is an ability\nthat was built up in childhood\nand or that perhaps we do all have\ndifferent genetic leanings\nfor different motor functions.\n- Yeah, well, for me, there could be,\nboth explanations could be possible.\nFor the first, yeah,\nI grew up in a family,\nlistening to Motown songs,\nyou know, dancing, you know,\nat parties and so forth,\nfamily parties and, you know,\nan African American family, basically.\nAnd so I grew up dancing\nfrom a young child,\nbut this discovery, you know,\nmaybe dancing even moreso,\nin terms of a talent,\nit could, the genetic component,\nif it really exists, I don't know.\nYou know, with my 23andMe\nresults, you know,\nit says I have the genetic substitutions\nthat are associated with, you know,\nhigh intensity athletes\nand fast twitch muscles.\nAnd who knows.\nMaybe that could have something to do with\nme being able to synchronize my body\nto rhythmic sounds, maybe,\nmaybe, better than some others.\nIt turns out that my genetics also show\nthat I have a genetic substitute\nthat makes it hard for\nme to sing on pitch.\nAnd so that does correlate\nwith my, you know,\neven though I can sing on this pitch,\nespecially if I hear a piano or, you know,\nkind of playing it, but,\nyou know, maybe that's\nwhy my siblings, you know,\nwho didn't have that\ngenetic predisposition\nin his 23andMe results, you know,\nit could go along with the\ngenetic component, as well.\n- I'm imagining family\ngatherings with 23andMe data\nand intense arguments about it,\ninnate and learned ability.\n- Yes.\n- Fun.\nLove to be an attendant.\nI'm not inviting myself to\nyour Thanksgiving dinner\nby the way, but I suppose I am.\n- You're welcome to.\n- Thank you.\nI'll bring my 23andMe data.\nI'd love to chat a moment\nabout facial expression\nbecause that's a form\nof motor pattern that,\nyou know, I think for\nmost people out there\njust think about smiling and frowning,\nbut there are, of course,\nyou know, thousands,\nif not millions of micro expressions\nand things of that sort,\nmany of which are subconscious.\nAnd we are all familiar with the fact that\nwhen what somebody says\ndoesn't match some specific feature\nof their facial expression\nthat it can call, you know,\nthat mismatch can cue our attention,\nespecially among people that\nknow each other very well.\nLike somebody will say,\nwell, you said that,\nbut your right eye\ntwitched to the, you know,\na little bit in a way that tells me\nthat you didn't really mean that,\nthese kinds of things.\nOr when, in the opposite example,\nwhen the emotionality and\nthe content of our speech\nis matched to a facial expression,\nthere's something that's\njust so wonderful about that,\nbecause it seems like\neverything's aligned.\n- [Erich] Yeah.\n- So how does the motor circuitry\nthat controls facial expression\nmap onto the brain circuits\nthat control language,\nspeech, and even bodily\nand hand movements?\n- Yeah, and you ask a great question\nbecause we both know some colleagues\nlike Winrich Freiwald at\nRockefeller University\nwho study facial expression\nand the neurology behind it.\nAnd now we both share some\nstudents that we're co-mentoring.\nAnd talk about this same\nquestion that you brought up.\nAnd what I'm learning a lot\nis that non-human primates\nhave a lot of diversity\nin their facial expression\nlike we humans do.\nAnd what we know about the neurobiology\nof brain regions controlling\nthose muscles of the face\nis that these non-human primates\nand some other species that don't learn\nhow to imitate vocalizations,\nthey have strong connections\nfrom the cortical regions\nto the motor neurons that\ncontrol facial expressions,\nbut absent connections or weak connections\nto the motor neurons\nthat control the voice.\nSo I think our diverse facial expression,\neven though it's more diverse\nin these non-human primates,\nthere was already a preexisting\ndiversity of communication,\nwhether it's intentional or unconscious\nthrough facial expression\nin our ancestors.\nAnd on top of that, we\nhumans now add the voice\nalong with those facial expressions.\n- I see.\nAnd in terms of language\nlearning when we're kids,\nI mean, children, fortunately are not told\nto fake their expressions\nor to smile when they say I'm happy.\nSo at some point, everybody\nlearns, for better or for worse,\nhow to untangle these different\ncomponents of hand movement,\nbody posture, speech,\nand facial expression.\n- [Erich] Yes.\n- But in their best form, I would say,\nassuming that the best form is always,\nI guess there are\ninstances where, you know,\nfor safety reasons, one might need\nto fain some of these aspects of language.\nBut in most cases, when those are aligned,\nit seems like that could reflect that\nall the different circuitries\nare operating in parallel,\nbut that the ability to misalign these\nis also a powerful\naspect to our maturation.\nI can think of theater, for instance,\nwhere deliberate disentangling\nof these areas is important.\nBut also we know when an actor,\nwhen it feels real.\n- Yep.\n- And when it looks like,\nwhen bad acting is oftentimes\nwhen the facial expression or body posture\njust doesn't quite match\nwhat we're hearing.\n- [Erich] Yeah.\n- So are these skills that people,\nthat learn and acquire according\nto adaptability and profession?\nOr do you think that all\nchildren and all adults\neventually learn how to couple\nand uncouple these circuits a little bit?\n- Yeah, I think it's this similar argument\nI mentioned earlier about\nthe innate and learned\nfor the vocalizations.\nAnd by the way, when I say,\nwe humans have facial expressions\nassociated with our vocalizations\nin a different way than\nprimates, non-human primates,\nit's the learned vocalizations\nI'm talking about.\nSo there is a common view out there\nthat facial expressions\nin non-human species\nlike nonhuman primates,\nor you can have them in birds, too,\nare innate, all right.\nAnd so they're reflexive and controlled.\nI don't believe that.\nI think there's some\nlearned component to it.\nAnd I think we have more\nlearning component to it as well,\nbut we also have an innate component.\nAnd so if you try to put\nyour hands behind your back\nand hold your fist, or even just not,\nand try to speak and try to communicate,\nit's actually harder to do.\nYou have to force yourself\nor put it by your side.\nThis comes naturally.\nFacial expressions comes naturally\nbecause there's an innate component.\nAnd yes, you have to learn\nhow to dissociate the two,\ncommunicate something\nangry with your hands\nor with your face,\nbut, you know, politely with your voice.\nIt's very hard to separate those two,\nbecause there is that innate component\nthat brings them together.\nSo it's like an email, too.\nYou're emailing and someone\nsays something by email,\nsomeone can interpret\nthat angrily or gently,\nand it becomes ambiguous.\nThe facial expressions\nget rid of that ambiguity.\n- So glad you brought that up\nbecause my next question was,\nand is about written language.\nThe first question I'll\nask is when you write,\neither type or write things out by hand,\ndo you hear the content\nof what you want to write\nin your head?\nJust, you personally.\n- Yes, I do.\nYeah, and I know that I do,\nbecause I was trying to figure\nout a debate about this issue\nand trying to resolve the debate\nwith my own self experimentation on me.\n- I asked that because,\na quite well-known colleague of ours,\nKarl Deisseroth at Stanford,\nwho's been on this podcast, you know,\nhis optogenetics fame and\npsychiatry fame, et cetera.\n- Yeah, I know him.\n- Yeah, he sends his regards.\n- Okay. [laughs]\n- Told me that his practice for writing\nand for thinking involves\na quite painful process\nof forcing himself to sit completely still\nand think in complete sentences,\nto force thinking in complete sentences.\nAnd when he told me that,\nI decided to try this exercise\nand it's quite difficult.\nFirst of all, it's difficult\nfor the reason that you mentioned,\nwhich is that with many thoughts,\nI want to look around\nand I start to gesticulate\nwith my hands, right?\nSo there it is, again,\nthe connection between\nlanguage and hand movement,\neven if one isn't speaking.\nAnd the other part that's challenging is\nI realize that while we\nwrite in complete sentences,\nmost of the time, we'll talk\nabout how that's changing now.\n- Right.\n- In texting, et cetera.\nThat we don't often think\nin complete sentences,\nand specifically in simple\ndeclarative sentences,\nthat a lot of our thoughts would be,\nif they were written out onto a page\nwould look pretty much\nlike passive language\nthat a good copy editor or\na good editor would say,\nugh, like we need to cross this out,\nmake this simple and declarative.\nSo what I'm getting at here is\nwhat is the process of going\nfrom a thought to language,\nto written word?\nAnd I also wanted to touch\non handwritten versus typed,\nbut thought to language, to written word.\nWhat's going on there?\nWhat do we know about\nthe neural circuitry?\nAnd I was going to ask, why is it so hard?\nBut now I want to ask why\nis this even possible?\nIt seems like a very challenging\nneural computational problem.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nAnd coming from the linguistic world,\nand even just the regular\nneurobiology world,\ngoing back to something I said before\nabout a separate language\nmodule in the brain.\nYou know, there was this\nthought or hypothesis\nthat this language module\nhas all these complex algorithms to them.\nAnd they're signaling\nto the speech circuit,\nhow to produce the sounds,\nthe hand circuit, how to\nwrite them or gesture,\nthe visual pathway on how to\ninterpret them from reading\nand the auditory pathway for listening.\nI don't think that's the case, all right.\nAnd you know, that this thinking where\nthere's this internal speech going on.\nWhat I think is going on is\nto explain what you're asking is about,\nthat I'm going to take\nit from the perspective,\nreading something.\nYou read something on a paper.\nThe signal from the paper\ngoes through your eyes.\nIt goes to the back of your brain,\nto your visual cortical\nregions eventually.\nAnd then you now got to\ninterpret that signal\nin your visual pathway\nof what you're reading.\nHow are you going to do\nthat in terms of speech?\nThat visual signal then\ngoes to your speech pathway\nin the motor cortex in\nfront here, in Broca's area.\nAnd you silently speak what you read\nin your brain without moving your muscles.\nAnd sometimes actually, if\nyou put electrodes, EEG,\nEMG electrodes on your laryngeal muscles,\neven on birds, you can do this,\nyou'll see activity there while reading\nor trying to speak silently,\neven though no sound's coming out.\nAnd so your speech pathway\nis now speaking what you're reading.\nNow to finish it off,\nthat signal is sent to\nyour auditory pathways\nso you can hear what you're\nspeaking in your own head.\n- That's incredible.\n- And this is why it's complicated\nbecause you're using like\nthree different pathways,\nthe visual, the speaking motor one,\nand the auditory to read.\nOh, and then you got to write, right?\nOkay, here comes the fourth one.\nNow the hand areas next\nto your speech pathway\nhas got to take that auditory signal\nor even the adjacent\nmotor signals for speaking\nand translate it into a\nvisual signal on paper.\nSo, you're using at least\nfour brain circuits,\nwhich includes the speech production\nand the speech perception\npathways to write.\n- Incredible.\nAnd finally, explain to me why,\nso I was weaned teaching undergraduates,\ngraduate students and medical students\nand I've observed that when I'm teaching,\nI have to stop speaking\nif I'm going to write\nsomething on the board.\nI just have to stop all\nspeaking completely.\n- [Erich] Right.\n- It turns out this is\nan advantage to catch\nbecause it allows me to catch my voice.\nIt allows me to slow down a bit, you know,\nbreathe and inhale some oxygen and so on\nbecause I tend to speak quickly\nif I'm not writing something out.\nSo there's a break in\nthe circuitry for me,\nor at least they are distinct enough\nthat I have to stop and\nthen write something out.\n- Yes, that does imply\ncompeting brain circuits\nfor your conscious attention.\n- We have colleagues up at Columbia Med\nwho are known, at least in our circles,\nfor voice dictating their\npapers, not writing them out,\nbut just speaking into a voice recorder.\nI've written papers that way.\nIt doesn't feel quite as natural for me\nas writing things out.\n- Yeah.\n- But not because I can\ngo quickly from thought\nto language to typing.\nI type reasonably fast.\nI can touch type now.\nI don't think I ever taught my,\nI think I taught myself.\nI never took a touch typing course.\nBut it just sort of happened.\nNow, I think, my motor system\nseems to know where the keys are\nwith enough accuracy, that it works.\nThis is remarkable to me\nthat any of us can do this.\nBut when it comes to writing,\nwhat I've found is that\nif my rate of thought\nand my rate of writing are\naligned nicely, things go well.\nHowever, if I'm thinking\nmuch faster than I can write,\nthat's a problem.\nAnd certainly, if I'm thinking more slowly\nthan I want to write,\nthat's also a problem.\nAnd the solution for me\nhas been to write with a pen.\nI'm in love with these.\nAnd I have no relationship to the company,\nat least not now, although\nif they want to come,\nyou know, if they want to work with us,\nI love these Pilot V5, V7's\nbecause not necessarily because of the ink\nor the feel, although I like that as well.\nBut because of the rate\nthat it allows me to write,\nthey write very well slowly,\nand they write very well quickly.\nAnd so I have this theory,\nsupported only by my own anecdata,\nno peer reviewed study,\nthat writing by hand is\nfundamentally different\nthan typing out information.\nIs there any evidence that\nthis motor pathway for writing\nis better or somehow different\nthan the motor pathway for typing?\n- Yeah, that's interesting.\nAnd I don't know of any studies.\nI have my own personal experience as well,\nbut trying to put this into the context,\nif I had to, you know,\ndesign an experiment to test\nthe hypothesis here that,\nyou know, to explain\nyour experience and mine,\nis that writing by hand,\nI would argue, requires a\ndifferent set of less skills\nwith the fingers than typing.\nSo you have to coordinate\nyour fingers more\nin opposite directions\nand so forth with typing,\nbut also writing by hand\nrequires more arm movement.\nAnd so therefore, I would argue that\nthe difficulty there could be\nin the types of muscles\nand the fine motor control\nyou need of those muscles\nalong with speaking in your\nbrain at the same time.\n- So basically, I'm a course, I'm a brute.\nSo it makes sense that I would have,\na more primitive writing\ndevice would work.\n- That's right, yes.\nBut, let me answer this in terms\nof my own personal experience, right.\nWhat I find is I can write\nsomething faster by hand\nfor a short period of\ntime, compared to typing.\nAnd that is because I think\nI run out of the energy\nin my arm movements\nfaster than I run out of muscle energy\nin my finger movements.\nAnd I think it takes longer time\nfor us to write words with our fingers,\nbecause, and in terms of the speech.\nSo I think your writing,\nwhether it's by hand or\ntyping and your speech,\nthey only will align very well\nif you can type as fast as you can speak\nor write as fast as you\ncan speak in your head.\n- I love it.\nSo what you've done, if\nI understand correctly,\nis created a bridge between\nthought and writing,\nand that bridge is speech.\n- That bridge is speech, that's right.\nThat's right.\nWhen you're writing something out,\nyou're speaking it to yourself.\nAnd if you're speaking\nfaster than you can type,\nyou've got a problem.\n- Interesting.\nI do a number of podcast episodes\nthat are not with guests,\nbut solo episodes.\nAnd as listeners know,\nthese are very long episodes,\noften two or more hours.\nAnd we joke around the podcast studio\nthat I will get locked\ninto a mode of speech\nwhere some of it is more\ncollaborative and anecdotal\nand then I'll punch out\nsimple declarative sentences.\nI find it very hard to switch\nfrom one module to the next.\nThe thing that I have done\nin order to make that\ntransition more fluid\nand prep for those podcast episodes\nis actually to read the lyrics of songs\nand to sing them in my head\nas a way of warming up my vocal chords.\nBut luckily for those\naround me, when I do that,\nI'm not actually singing out loud.\nAnd so this, what you're telling me\nsupports this idea that even\nwhen we are imagining singing\nor writing in our mind,\nwe are exercising our vocal chords.\n- You're actually getting\nlittle low potentials\nof electrical currents\nreaching your muscles there,\nwhich also means you're exercising\nyour speech brain circuits too,\nwithout actually, you know,\ngoing with the full-blown\nactivity in the muscles.\n- Incredible.\n- Yeah.\nAnd this idea of singing\nhelps you as well.\nEven with Parkinson's\npatients and so forth,\nwhen they want to say something,\nsinging or listening to\nmusic helps them move better.\nAnd the idea there is that the\nbrain circuits for singing,\nor let's say the function of\nthe brain circuits for speech\nbeing used for singing first\nis the more ancestral trait.\nAnd that's why it's easier\nto do things with singing\nsometimes than it is with speaking.\n- I love it.\nStutter is a particularly interesting case\nand one that every once in a while,\nI'll get questions about\nthis from our audience.\nStutter is complicated\nin a number of ways,\nbut culturally, and my\nunderstanding from these emails\nthat I receive is that\nstutter can often cause\npeople to hide and speak less\nbecause it can be embarrassing.\nAnd we are often not patient with stutter.\nWe also have the assumption\nthat if somebody's stuttering,\nthat they're thinking is slow,\nbut it turns out there are many examples,\nhistorically of people\nwho could not speak well,\nbut who were brilliant thinkers.\nI don't know how well they could write,\nbut they found other\nmodes of communication.\nI realize that you're not a\nspeech pathologist or therapist,\nbut what is the current neurobiological\nunderstanding of stutter\nand, or what's being developed\nin terms of treatments for stutter?\n- Yeah, so we actually accidentally\ncame across stuttering in songbirds.\nAnd we've published several papers on this\nto try to figure out the\nneurobiological basis.\nThe first study we had was a brain area\ncalled the basal ganglio,\nor the striatum part of the basal ganglia\ninvolved in coordinating movements,\nlearning how to make movements,\nwhen it was damaged in a\nspeech-like pathway in these birds,\nwhat we found is that\nthey started to stutter\nas the brain region recovered.\nAnd unlike humans,\nthey actually recovered\nafter three or four months.\nAnd why is that the case?\nBecause bird brains\nundergoes new neurogenesis\nin a way that human or\nmammal brains don't.\nAnd it was the new neurons\nthat were coming in\ninto the circuit, but not quite, you know,\nwith the right proper activity\nwas resulting in this\nstuttering, in these birds.\nAnd after it was repaired,\nnot exactly the old song\ncame back after the repair,\nbut still it recovered a lot better.\nAnd it's now known,\nthey call this neurogenic\nstuttering in humans,\ndamage to the basal ganglia\nor some type of disruption\nto the basal ganglia at a young age,\nalso causes stuttering in humans.\nAnd even those who are\nborn with stuttering,\nit's often the basal\nganglia that's disrupted\nthan some other brain circuit\nand we think the speech\npart of the basal ganglia.\n- Can adults who maintain\na stutter from childhood\nrepair that stutter?\n- They can repair it with therapy,\nwith learning how to speak slower,\nlearning how to tap out a rhythm.\nAnd yeah, I'm not a speech pathologist,\nbut I started reading this literature\nand talking to others, that you know,\ncolleagues who actually study stuttering.\nSo yes, there are ways to\novercome the stuttering\nthrough, you know, behavioral therapy.\nAnd I think all of the tools out there\nhave something to do with\nsensory motor integration,\ncontrolling what you\nhear with what you output\nin a thoughtful controlled way\nhelps reduce the stuttering.\n- There are a couple\nexamples from real life\nthat I want to touch on,\nand one is somewhat facetious,\nbut now I realize, is a\nserious neurobiological issue,\nserious meaning I think interesting.\nWhich is that every once in a while,\nI will have a conversation with somebody\nwho says the last word of\nthe sentence along with me.\nAnd it seems annoying in some instances,\nbut I'm guessing this\nis just a breakthrough\nof the motor pattern\nthat they're hearing what\nI'm saying very well.\nSo I'm going to interpret this kindly\nand think they're hearing what I'm saying.\nThey're literally hearing it in their mind\nand they're getting that\nlow-level electrical activity\nto their throat.\nAnd they're just joining me\nin the enunciation of what I'm saying,\nprobably without realizing it.\nCan we assume that that might be the case?\n- Well, I wouldn't be\nsurprised so that, you know,\nthe motor theory of speech perception\nwhere this idea originally came,\nwhat you hear is going\nthrough your speech circuit\nand then also activating\nthose muscles slightly.\nSo yes, so one might argue,\nokay, is that speech\ncircuit now interpreting\nwhat that person is speaking?\nNow, you're listening to me\nand is going to finish it off\nbecause it's already\ngoing through their brain\nand they can predict it?\nThat would be one theory.\nAnd I don't think the\nverdict out there is known,\nbut that's one.\nThe other is synchronizing\nturn-taking in the conversation\nwhere you're acknowledging\nthat we understand each other\nby finishing off what I say.\nAnd it's almost like a\nsocial bonding kind of thing.\nThe other could be,\nI want the person to shut up\nso I can speak as well and take that turn.\nAnd each pair of people have a\nrhythm to their conversation.\nAnd if you have somebody\nwho's over talkative\nversus under talkative of vice versa,\nthat rhythm can be lost\nin them finishing ideas\nand going back and forth.\nBut I think having something\nto do with turn-taking,\nas well, makes a lot of sense.\n- I have a colleague at Stanford who says\nthat interruption is a sign of interest.\n[Erich laughs]\nI'm not sure that everyone agrees.\nI think it's highly contextual.\n- [Erich] Yes.\n- But there is this form of a verbal nod\nof saying, hmm hmm or things of that sort.\nAnd they're many of these.\nAnd I'm often told by\nmy audience, you know,\nthat I interrupt my guests\nand things of that sort.\nOftentimes, I'll just get\ncaught in the natural flow\nof the conversation, but.\n- Right.\nWell, I think we've had\npretty good turn-taking here,\nI hope.\n- So far so good.\n- I feel that way.\n- I'm glad you feel that way,\nbecause especially in the\ncontext of a discussion\nabout language.\n- Yes.\n- It seems important.\nTexting is a very, very\ninteresting evolution of language\nbecause what you've told us\nis that we have a thought,\nit's translated into language.\nIt might not be complete sentences,\nbut texting, I have to\nimagine this is the first time\nin human evolution where\nwe've written with our thumbs.\nSo I don't know,\nit seems more primitive to\nme than typing with fingers\nor writing with hands, but hey,\nwho am I to judge the\nevolution of our species\nin one direction or the other?\nBut the shorthand grammatically,\noften grammatically deficient\nincomplete sentence form\nof texting is an incredible thing to see.\nEarly in relationships,\nromantic relationships,\npeople will often evaluate the others text\nand their ability to use proper grammar\nand spelling, et cetera.\nThis often quickly degrades.\nAnd there's an acceptance\nthat we're just trying to\ncommunicate through shorthand,\nalmost military like shorthand,\nbut with internally\nconsistent between people,\nbut there's no general\nconsensus of what things mean,\nbut, you know, WTFs and like,\nand OMGs and all sorts of things.\n- [Erich] Right.\n- I wonder sometimes whether or not\nwe are getting less proficient at speech\nbecause we are not\nrequired to write and think\nin complete sentences.\n- Hmm hmm.\n- I'm not being judgemental here.\nI see this in my colleagues.\nI see this in myself.\nThis is not a judgment of\nthe younger generation.\nI also know that slang\nhas existed for decades,\nif not hundreds of years.\nBut I also know that I\ndon't speak the same way\nthat I did when I was a teenager,\nbecause I've suppressed\na lot of that slang,\nnot because it's\ninappropriate or offensive,\nalthough some of it was, frankly,\nbut because it's out of context.\nSo what do you think's\nhappening to language?\nAre we getting better at\nspeaking, worse at speaking?\nAnd what do you think the role of things\nlike texting and tweeting\nand shorthand communication, hashtagging,\nwhat's that doing to the\nway that our brains work?\n- Yeah, I think that,\nwell, one, in terms of, you know,\nmeasuring your level of\nsophistication and intelligence\nwhen you say OMG, right.\nI think that also could\nbe a cultural thing\nthat, ah, you belong\nto the next generation.\nIf you're an, you know,\nor you're being cool,\nif you're an older person, you know,\nusing OMG and other\nthings that the, you know,\nyounger generation would use.\nBut if I really think about it clearly,\ntexting actually has allowed\nfor more rapid communication\namongst people.\nI think, without the invention\nof the phone before then,\nor, you know, texting back and forth,\nyou had to wait days\nfor a letter to show up.\nYou couldn't call somebody on the phone\nand talk as well, you know?\nAnd so this rapid communication\nin terms of the rapid communication\nof writing in this case.\nSo I think actually,\nit's more like a use it or lose it\nkind of a thing with the brain.\nThe more you use a particular\nbrain region or circuit,\nthe more enhanced.\nIt's like a muscle.\nThe more you exercise it,\nthe more healthier it is,\nthe bigger it becomes and\nthe more space it takes\nand the more you lose something else.\nSo I think texting is not decreasing\nthe speech prowess,\nor the intellectual prowess of speech.\nIt's converting it and using\nit a lot in a different way,\nin a way that may not be\nas rich in regular writing,\nbecause you can only\ncommunicate so much nuance\nin short-term writing,\nbut whatever is being done,\nyou got people texting hours and hours\nand hours on the phone.\nSo whatever, your thumb circuit\nis going to get pretty big,\nactually. [laughs]\n- I do wonder whether, you know,\nmany people have lost\ntheir jobs based on tweets.\n- [Erich] Hmm hmm.\n- The short latency\nbetween thought and action\nand distribution of one's thoughts\nis incredible.\n- Yes.\n- And I'm not just talking about people\nwho apparently would have poor\nprefrontal top-down control.\nThis is geek speak by the way,\nfor people that lack impulse control.\nBut high-level academics,\nI'm not going to point fingers at anyone.\nBut examples of where you\nsee these tweets and you go,\nwhat were they thinking?\n- Yep.\n- So presumably, there's\nan optimal strategy\nbetween the thought speech motor pathway,\nespecially when the motor\npathway engages communication\nwith hundreds of thousands of people\nand retweets in particular\nand the cut and paste function\nand the screenshot function\nare often the reason\nwhy speech propagates.\n- [Erich] Yep.\n- So to me, it's a little eerie that,\njust that the neural circuitry can do this\nand that we are catching\nup a little bit more slowly\nto the technology,\nand you've got these\ncasualties of that mismatch.\n- I think that's a good\nadjective used, the casualties,\nyou know, of what's going on,\nbecause yes, it is the case with texting,\nwhat you're really losing there\nis less so the ability to write,\nbut more the ability to\ninterpret what is being written.\nAnd you can over or under interpret\nsomething that somebody means.\nOn the flip side of that, you know,\nif somebody's writing\nsomething very quick,\nthey could be writing instinctually,\nmore instinctually, their true meaning,\nand they don't have time to modify\nand color code what they're trying to say.\nAnd that's what they really feel\nand as opposed to saying\nit in a more nuanced way.\nSo I think both sides of\nthat casualty are present.\nAnd that's a downturn, you know,\nunintended negative\nconsequence of short-term,\nI mean, short-word communications.\n- Yeah, I agree that this whole phenomenon\ncould be netting people that normally\nwould only say these things out loud\nonce inside the door of their own home.\n- Right.\n- Or not at all.\n- [Erich] Right.\n- It's an interesting time that we're in.\nThese are these speech and\nlanguage and motor patterns.\n- So part of the human\nevolution for language,\nI think this is all part of our evolution.\n- That's right.\n- Yeah.\n- So for those of you\nthinking terrible thoughts,\nplease put them in the\nworld and be a casualty.\nAnd for those of you that are not,\nplease be very careful with how proficient\nyour thought to language\nto motor action goes.\n- [Erich] Yes. [laughs]\n- Maybe the technology companies\nshould install some buffers,\nsome AI-based buffers.\n- Right, that's taking some EEG signals\nfrom your brain while\nyou're texting to say,\nokay, this is not a\ngreat thought, slow down.\n- Right, or this doesn't\nreflect your best state.\nThat brings me to\nwhat was going to be the\nnext question anyway,\nwhich is we are quickly\nmoving toward a time\nwhere there will be an\neven faster transition\nfrom thought to speech, to motor output,\nand maybe won't require motor output.\nWhat I'm referring to here\nis some of the incredible\nwork of our colleagues,\nEddie Chang at UCSF and others\nwho are taking paralyzed human beings\nand learning to translate\nthe electrical signals\nof neurons in various areas,\nincluding speech and language areas,\nto computer screens that type out\nwhat these people are thinking.\nIn other words,\nparalyzed people can put\ntheir thoughts into writing.\nThat's a pretty extreme\nand wonderful example\nof recovery of function.\n- Hmm hmm.\n- That is sure to continue to evolve.\nBut I think we are headed toward a time,\nnot too long from now\nwhere my thoughts can be\ntranslated into words on a page\nif I allow that to happen.\n- Yeah so, and Eddie Chang's work,\nwhich I admire quite a\nbit and cite in my papers,\nI think he's really one of\nthose at the leading edge\nof trying to understand within humans,\nthe neurobiology of speech.\nAnd he may not say it\ndirectly, but you know,\nI talked to him about this.\nIt supports this idea\nthat the speech circuit\nand the separate language module,\nI don't really think that\nthere's a separation there.\nSo with that knowledge,\nyes, and putting\nelectrodes into human brain\nand then translating\nthose electrical signals\nto speech currents.\nYeah, we can start to tell\nwhat is that person thinking?\nWhy, because we often\nthink in terms of speech.\nAnd without saying words.\nAnd that's a scary thought.\nAnd now imagine if you can now translate\nthose into a signal that\ntransmits something wirelessly\nand someone from some\ndistant part of the planet\nis hearing your speech\nfrom a wireless signal\nwithout you speaking.\nSo probably that won't be\ndone in an ethical way,\nwho knows, you know?\nBut I mean, the ethics\nof doing that probably,\nyou know, might not happen, but who knows?\nWe have these songbirds, you know.\nIf we apply the same technique to them,\nwe can start to hear what they're singing\nin their dreams or whatever,\neven though they don't produce sound\nso we can find out by testing on them.\n- It's coming.\n- Yes.\n- One way or another, it's coming.\nFor those listening who are interested\nin getting better at speaking\nand understanding languages,\nare there any tools that you recommend?\nAnd here again,\nI realize you're not a speech therapist,\nbut here I'm not thinking about\nameliorating any kind\nof speech deficiency.\nI'm thinking, for instance,\ndo you recommend that people read\ndifferent types of writing?\nWould you recommend that\npeople learn how to dance\nin order to become better at\nexpressing themselves verbally?\nYou know, and feel free to\nhave some degrees of freedom\nin this answer.\nThese are obviously not\npeer-reviewed studies\nthat we're referring to,\nalthough there may be,\nbut I'm struck by the number of things\nthat you do exceedingly well,\nand I can't help but ask,\nwell, the singing, which I realize it may,\nyour brother didn't pay me to say this,\nmay not be quite as good\nas your brothers yet,\nbut is getting, you'll surpass him,\nI'm guessing at some point.\n♪ Getting there ♪\n- Getting there.\n[both laughing]\nExactly, there you go.\nYou know, should kids learn how to dance\nand read hard books and simple books?\nWhat do you recommend?\nShould adults learn how to do that?\nEveryone wants to know how\nto keep their brain working\nbetter, so to speak.\nBut also I think people want\nto be able to speak well\nand people want to be\nable to understand well.\n- Yeah, so what I've\ndiscovered personally, right,\nis that, so when I switched\nfrom pursuing a career in\nscience from a career in dance,\nI thought one day I would stop dancing,\nbut I haven't because I\nfind it fulfilling for me,\nyou know, just as a life experience.\nSo ever since I started college,\nyou know, my late teens\nand early twenties,\nI kept dancing even till this day.\nAnd there've been periods of time,\nlike during the pandemic\nwhere I slowed down on\ndancing and so forth.\nAnd when you do that, you realize, okay,\nthere are parts of your body\nwhere your muscle tone decreases\na little bit and somewhat,\nor you could start to gain weight.\nI somehow don't gain weight that easily.\nAnd I think it's related to my dance,\nif that's meaningful to your audience.\nBut what I found is, you know,\nin science, we like to\nthink of a separation\nbetween movement and action and cognition.\nAnd there is a separation for you\nbetween perception and production,\ncognition being perception,\nproduction being moving, right.\nBut if the speech pathways\nis next to the movement pathways,\nwhat I discover is by dancing,\nit is helping me think.\nIt is helping keeping my brain fresh.\nIt's not just moving my muscles,\nI'm moving or using the\ncircuitry in my brain\nto control a whole big body.\nYou need a lot of brain tissue to do that.\nAnd so I argue,\nif you want to stay cognitively\nintact into your old age,\nyou better be moving\nand you better be doing it consistently,\nwhether it's dancing, walking, running,\nand also practicing speech,\noratory speech and so forth or singing,\nis controlling the brain circuits\nthat are moving your facial musculature.\nAnd it's going to keep your\ncognitive circuits also in tune.\nAnd I'm convinced of that from\nmy own personal experience.\n- Yeah, for me, long, slow runs\nare a wonderful way to\nkind of loosen the joints\nfor long podcasts,\nespecially the solo podcast,\nwhich can take many hours to record.\nAnd without those long slow runs,\nat least the day before,\nor even the morning of,\nI don't think I could do\nit, at least not as well.\n- All right, well, you're\nexperiencing something similar.\nSo that's an N of two.\n- Yeah, N of two.\nI'm tempted to learn how to dance\nbecause there are a lot of\nreasons to learn how to dance.\n- [Erich] Yes.\n- And people can use their imagination.\nI definitely want to get the opportunity\nto talk about some of the newer work\nthat you're into right now\nabout genomes of animals.\nAs you perhaps can tell\nfrom my quite authentic\nfacial expressions,\nI adore the animal kingdom.\nI just find it amazing.\nAnd it's the reason I went\ninto neurobiology, in part.\nSo many animals, so many\ndifferent patterns of movement,\nso many body plans, so\nmany specializations,\nwhat is the value of learning the genomes\nof all these animals?\nYou know, I can think of\nconservation-based, you know,\nschemes of trying to preserve\nthese precious critters,\nbut what are you doing with\nthe genomes of these animals?\nWhat do you want to understand\nabout their brain circuits?\nAnd how does this relate\nto some of the discussion\nwe've have been having up until now?\n- Yeah, I've gotten very\nheavily involved in genomes,\nyou know, not just to\nget at an individual gene\ninvolved in the trade of\ninterest, like spoken language,\nbut I realize that, you know,\nnature has done natural experiments for us\nwith all these species out\nthere with these various traits\nand the one that I'm\nstudying, like vocal learning,\nhas evolved multiple times\namong the animal kingdom,\neven if it's rare, it's multiple times.\nAnd the similar genetic changes\noccurred in those species.\nBut to find out what those genetic changes\nthat are associated with\nthe trait of interests\nand not some other trait\nlike flying in birds,\nas opposed to singing,\nyou have to do what's\ncalled comparative genomics,\neven in the context of studying the brain.\nAnd you need their genomes\nto compare the genomes\nand do like a GWA, a\ngenome-wide association study,\nnot just within a species like\nhumans, but across species.\nAnd so you need good genomes to do that.\nPlus, I've discovered I'm also interested\nin evolution and origins.\nHow did these species\ncome about a similar trait\nin last, you know, 300 million\nyears or 60 million years,\ndepending who you're talking about.\nAnd you need a good\nphylogenetic tree to do that,\nand to get a good phylogenetic tree,\nyou also need their genomes.\nAnd so, because of this,\nI got involved in large scale consortiums\nto produce genomes of\nmany different species,\nincluding my vocal learners\nand their closest\nrelatives that I'm fans of.\nBut I couldn't convince\nthe funding agencies\nto gimme the money to do\nthat just for my own project.\nBut when you get a whole\nbunch of people together\nwho want to study various traits,\nyou know, heart disease,\nor loss and gain in flight and so forth,\nsuddenly we all need lots\nof genomes to do this.\nAnd so now that got me into a project\nto lead something called the\nVertebrate Genomes Project\nto eventually sequence all\n70,000 species on the planet.\nAnd Earth BioGenome Project,\nall eukaryotic species,\nall two million of them.\nAnd to no longer be in a situation\nwhere I wish I had this genome.\nNow we have the genetic code\nof all life on the planet,\ncreate a database of all their traits\nand find the genetic association\nwith everything out there\nthat makes a difference\nfrom one species to another.\nOne more piece of the\nequation to add to this story\nis what I didn't realize\nas a neuroscientist\nwere that these genomes\nare not only incomplete,\nbut have lots of errors in them,\nfalse gene duplications,\nwhere mother and father chromosomes\nwere so different from each other,\nthat the genome algorithm,\nassembly algorithms treated\nthem as two different genes\nin this part of the chromosome.\nSo there are a lot of these\nfalse duplicated genes\nthat people thought\nwere real, but were not\nor missing parts of the genome\nbecause the enzymes\nused to sequence the DNA\ncouldn't get through\nthis regulatory region\nthat folded up on itself\nand made it hard to sequence.\nAnd so I ended up in these consortiums\npulling in the genome\nsequencing companies,\ndeveloping the technology to work with us\nto improve it further\nand the computer science guys\nwho then take that data\nand that technology,\nand try to make the complete genomes\nand make the algorithms better\nto produce what we now just did recently\nled by an effort by Adam Phillippy\nis the first human\nTelomere-to-Telomere Genome\nwith no errors, all complete,\nno missing sequence.\nAnd now we're trying to do the\nsame thing with vertebrates\nand other species.\nActually, we improved\nthat before we got to the,\nwhat we call telomere-to-telomere,\nfrom one end of the chromosome to another.\nAnd what we're discovering\nis in this dark matter of the genome\nthat was missing before,\nturns out to be some regulatory regions\nthat are specialized in\nvocal learning species\nand we think are involved in\ndeveloping speech circuits.\n- Incredible.\nWell, so much to learn.\nAnd we're going to learn\nfrom this information.\nEarly on in these genome\nprojects and connectome projects,\nI confess I was a little bit cynical.\nThis would be about 10, 15 years ago.\nI thought, okay, necessary,\nbut not sufficient for anything.\nWe need it, but it's not\nclear what's going to happen,\nbut you just gave a very clear example\nof what we stand to learn\nfrom this kind of information.\nAnd I know from the conservation side,\nthere's a huge interest in this\nbecause even though we would prefer\nto keep all these species\nalive rather than clone them,\nthese sorts of projects\ndo offer the possibility\nof potentially recreating\nspecies that were lost.\n- [Erich] Right.\n- Due to our own ignorance or\nmissteps, or what have you.\n- Yes, and along those lines,\nbecause, you know, we\ngot involved in genomics,\nsome of the first species\nthat we start working on\nare critically endangered species.\nAnd I'm doing that not only for, you know,\nperspectives to understand their brains\nand the genes involved\nin their brain function,\nbut I feel like it's a moral duty.\nSo the fact that now\nI become more involved\nin genome biology\nand have helped develop these tools\nfor more complete genomes,\nlet's capture their genetic\ncode now, before they're gone.\nAnd could we use that information\nto resurrect the species\nat some future time,\nif not in my lifetime,\nin some time in the future\nand generations ahead of us.\nAnd so, in anticipation of that,\nwe create a database,\nwe call the GenomeArk\nand no pun intended like Noah's Ark,\nmeant to store the genetic code\nas complete genome assemblies as possible\nfor all species on the planet\nto be used for basic science,\nbut also some point in the future.\nAnd because of that,\nfunding agencies or private foundations\nthat are interested in conservation\nhave been reaching out to\nme now, a neuroscientist,\nto help them out in producing\nhigh quality genome data\nof endangered species that they can use,\nlike Revive & Restore,\nwho want to resurrect the passenger pigeon\nor Colossal, who wants to\nresurrect the wooly mammoth.\nAnd so we're producing\nhigh quality genomes\nfor these groups, for the\nconservation projects.\n- What a terrific and\nimportant initiative.\nAnd I think for those listening today,\nthey now certainly understand the value\nof deeply understanding\nthe brain structures\nand genomes of different species.\nBecause I confess,\neven though I knew a bit\nof the songbird literature,\nand I certainly understand\nthat humans have speech and language,\nI had no idea that there\nwas so much convergence\nof function, structure and genomes.\nAnd to me, you know,\nI feel a lot more like\nan ape than I do a songbird.\n- Right.\n- And yet here we are\nwith the understanding\nthat there's a lot more similarity\nbetween songbirds and humans\nthan I certainly ever thought before.\n- Yeah, something very\nclose to home for us humans,\nI can give you an example of\nis evolution of skin color.\nAnd skin color, we use it unfortunately,\nfor racism and so forth.\nWe use it also for good\nthings to let in more light\nor let out less light depending\non the part of the planet,\nyou know, our population evolved in.\nAnd most people think dark-skinned people\nall evolved from the\nsame dark-skinned person\nand light-skinned people all evolved\nfrom the same light-skinned person,\nbut that's not the case.\nDark skin and light skin amongst humans\nhas evolved independently multiple times,\nlike in, you know, the\nPacific islands versus Africa.\nAnd it's just depending on the angle\nof light hitting the Earth\nas to whether you need more\nprotection from the sun\nor less protection,\nthat's also associated with\nVitamin D synthesis in the skin.\nAnd so, and each time,\nwhere darker or lighter\nskin evolved independently,\nit hit the same gene, you know,\nthe mela [finger snaps].\n- Melanin.\n- Melanin receptors.\nThat's right, yes, yeah.\nGenes that are involved\nin melanin in formation.\nAnd so those genes evolve\nsome of the same mutations,\neven in different species.\nIt's not just humans.\nIn equatorial regions, they\nare darker-skinned animals\nthan going away from the equator.\n- Oh, right, I think of Arctic foxes\nand things of that sort.\n- Yep, that's right.\nThat's right, polar bears, you know,\nand so some of the same genes are used\nin evolutionary perspective\nto evolve in a similar way\nwithin and across species.\n- Incredible.\n- Yeah.\nAnd that's same thing\nhappening in the brain too.\nLanguage is no exception.\n- Well, I have to say,\nas somebody who is a, you\nknow, career neuroscientist,\nbut as I mentioned several times now,\nwho also adores the animal kingdom,\nbut is also obsessed\nwith speech and language,\nat a distance not as a\npractitioner of music and dance,\nthis has been an incredible conversation\nand opportunity for me to learn.\nAnd I know I speak for a\ntremendous number of people\nand I just really want to say,\nthank you for joining us today.\nYou are incredibly busy.\nIt's clear from your\ndescription of your science\nand your
