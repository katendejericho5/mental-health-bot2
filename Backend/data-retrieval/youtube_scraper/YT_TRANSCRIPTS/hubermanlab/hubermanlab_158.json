    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're discussing alcohol,\none of the most commonly\nconsumed substances\non the planet Earth.\nI should mention that both humans\nand non-human animals consume alcohol\neither for recreational purposes\nbecause they like the\nfeeling that it gives them\nor for medicinal purposes\nor for other purposes that we'll discuss.\nWe are, of course, going to\ndiscuss the effects of alcohol\non our biology, ranging from its effects\non individual cells, on\norgans and organ systems\nin our brain and body.\nWe are also going to discuss the effects\nof the effects of alcohol,\nthat is, what being inebriated really does\nto our thinking and our\nbehavior and how it does it.\nAnd we are going to address\nwhat seems to be one of the\nmore common questions out there,\nwhich is whether or not low to\nmoderate amounts of drinking\nare better for our health\nthan zero alcohol consumption at all.\nAnd of course we will talk\nabout severe alcohol\nintake, binge drinking.\nWe will also talk about hangover\nand what science says about ways\nto reduce the effects of hangover,\neither by doing things\nthat are inoculatory,\nmeaning before you drink\nor while you drink,\nas well as things to do if\nyou happen to have a hangover.\nWe will discuss some of\nthe genetic differences\nfor alcohol and alcoholism,\nand we will discuss alcohol\nconsumption in young people\nand how that can be especially\ndetrimental for reasons\nthat I think are going to be\nquite surprising to most of you.\nMy goal is that by the\nend of today's episode,\nyou will have a thorough understanding\nof what alcohol does\nto your brain and body\nand that you will be able\nto make informed decisions\nas to whether or not you\nshould be consuming zero,\nabsolutely no alcohol,\nsmall to moderate amounts of alcohol,\nand, again, we'll define\nexactly what that means,\nsmall to moderate amounts,\nand if you or somebody else that you know\nis consuming excessive amounts of alcohol\nthat are clearly\ndetrimental to your health,\nsome of the better routes and\nresources that you can use\nin order to remove that\ndependence and/or consumption.\nI'd like to preface all of that by saying\nthat today's discussion is really geared\ntoward giving you information.\nIt is not about judging alcohol intake\nor lack of alcohol intake.\nI just want you to be able to make\nthe most informed decision\nabout alcohol possible.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nWe've partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all, they ship internationally,\nbecause we know that many of you\nare located outside of the United States.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none\nboth in terms of purity\nand precision of the\namounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single-ingredient supplements\nand that are supplied in dosages\nthat allow you to build a\nsupplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add things\nand remove things from your protocol\nin a way that's really\nsystematic and scientific.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partner with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere, you'll see those supplements,\nand just keep in mind\nthat we are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we get into\ntoday's content in detail,\nI just want to answer a\ncommonly asked question\nabout alcohol consumption and the brain,\nand the question that so often comes up\nis whether or not low to\nmoderate amounts of alcohol,\nso maybe one drink a day\nor one or two drinks a day kind of thing,\nwhether or not that is bad for your brain,\nin particular, whether or\nnot it causes degeneration\nof neurons or nerve cells.\nNow, the reason that\nquestion comes up so often\nis because, for many years,\nit's been known that high\nlevels of alcohol consumption,\nso 12 to 24 drinks per week or more,\nis certainly causing neurodegeneration,\nin particular of the so-called neocortex,\nthe outer layers of the brain\nthat house associative memories,\nthat house our ability to think and plan,\nthat house our ability to\nregulate our more primitive drives\naccording to context, et cetera.\nSo to make very clear, drinking a lot,\nso having, you know, three\nor four drinks per night\nevery night of the week, is\nclearly bad for the brain.\nA recent study, however,\nfinally addressed the question\nof whether or not low to moderate amounts\nof alcohol consumption can\ncause brain degeneration.\nThe title of the study\nis Associations between\nalcohol consumption\nand gray and white matter\nvolumes in the UK Biobank,\nthe United Kingdom Biobank.\nFirst of all, gray matter are the neurons,\nit's the so-called cell bodies\nthat house the genome\nof the cells, et cetera,\nand white matter is the\nconnections, the fibers,\nthe so-called axons of neurons,\nand it's called white\nmatter because that tissue\nis surrounded by a fatty\ntissue called myelin,\nwhich allows nerve cells\nto communicate with\neach other very quickly.\nSo what this study did is\nit looked at the brains,\nboth the gray matter and the white matter,\nof more than 30,000, and\neven more than 35,000\ngenerally healthy\nmiddle-aged and older adults\nin the United Kingdom\nwho were drinking various\namounts of alcohol.\nWhat they found was that even for people\nthat were drinking low to\nmoderate amounts of alcohol,\nso one or two drinks per day,\nthere was evidence of\nthinning of the neocortex,\nso loss of neurons in the neocortex,\nand other brain regions.\nAnd I don't say this in\norder to cause alarm.\nI tell you this because\nthey are important data\nbecause they reveal and\nindeed answer the question\nthat has been burning for so long\nas to whether or not\nchronic alcohol intake\ncan disrupt the brain\neven if the chronic intake is very low.\nNow, we should talk about\nwhat the word chronic means\nbecause many people, when\nthey hear the word chronic,\nthink high levels of\nwhatever intake, okay?\nSo they think 5 drinks a\nnight or 10 drinks a night\nor people drinking every night.\nNow, in this study, they looked at people\nwho, on average, were drinking\none or two drinks per night.\nSo that could be 14 drinks on the weekend,\nit could be one drink per night.\nit could be seven drinks on Friday,\nin other words, on average,\none or two drinks per night.\nAnd I think many people out there\nare drinking somewhere\nbetween one and two drinks\nper night or day of the week on average,\nso that would be 7 to 14 drinks per week.\nSo this is an important study\nbecause it says that if you're consuming\neven just seven glasses\nof wine across the week,\nit's likely that there is\ngoing to be some degeneration\nof your brain in response\nto that alcohol intake.\nAlthough, as mentioned earlier,\nwe will talk about some of the things\nthat can inoculate against\nsome of that neuronal loss.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin reading the study in more detail,\nwe've put a link to it in\nthe show note captions.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost-to-consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\nLevels is a program that lets you see\nhow different foods affect your health\nby giving you real-time\nfeedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\nOne of the most important features\nof our immediate feelings of well-being\nand our ability to focus and\nthink and move and have energy,\nas well as our long-term health,\nare our blood glucose levels.\nThat is, our blood sugar levels.\nAnd that's because all the\ncells and tissues of our body\nand especially neurons, nerve cells,\nrely on glucose for fuel.\nI realize some of you\nout there are ketogenic,\nand, yes, you can use ketones for fuel,\nbut the vast majority of people\nare using glucose for fuel in their cells.\nIf you want to maintain energy\nand focus throughout the day,\nyou want to keep that blood glucose steady\nand you don't want it ever\nto spike or to drop too much,\nso you need to understand\nhow different foods\nand indeed how different activities\nimpact your blood glucose.\nI started using Levels about a year ago\nas a way to understand how\ndifferent foods and exercise\nand supplements and combinations\nof food and exercise\nand even sequencing, like when I do what,\nhow that affects my blood glucose levels.\nIt's been tremendously informative.\nIt's completely reshaped when\nI exercise, how I exercise,\nwhen I eat relative to\nexercise, et cetera.\nSo if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\ngo to levels.link/huberman.\nAgain, that's levels.link/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nwith cooling, heating, and\nsleep tracking capacity.\nI've talked many times on the podcast\nabout the fact that getting\na great night's sleep\nis the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand all forms of performance.\nAnd one of the key variables\nin getting a great night's sleep\nis making sure that your\nsleeping environment\nis the right temperature.\nIndeed, your brain and body have to drop\nby one to three degrees\nin order to get into sleep\nand to stay in deep sleep\nthroughout the night.\nIf your room is too hot or\nif you're running too warm,\nyou will wake up.\nIn fact, that is why you\nwake up in the morning.\nWith Eight Sleep, you can\nadjust the temperature\nof your mattress and your\noverall sleeping environment\nand customize that to you.\nI started using Eight Sleep some time ago\nand it's just been a total game changer.\nI program mine so that\nthere's a subtle drop\nin the temperature of my mattress\nat the beginning of the night\nand then it gets progressively cooler\nand then it heats up toward morning.\nIt even has this nice\nlittle vibrate feature\nso it wakes me up by vibrating\nthe mattress a little bit.\nAnd, of course, that mattress is warming\nand warming is the way that we wake up.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep,\ngo to eightsleep.com/huberman.\nCheck out their Pro Pod Cover\nand save up to $150 at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships in the USA,\nCanada,

absolute highest quality,\nand they also have some\nunique characteristics.\nThe company was founded\nby two all-American swimmers from Stanford\nand everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance in mind.\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\ncan be worn while running or cycling.\nIf you get sweaty, they\nwon't fall off your face,\nand they're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the time,\nI can't even remember\nthat I'm wearing them.\nI wear ROKA eyeglasses\nwhen I read at night,\nso I wear their readers,\nand I wear sunglasses at various\ntimes throughout the day.\nThe great thing about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nis that even though they were designed\nfor athletic performance,\nthey have a terrific aesthetic.\nSo unlike a lot of so-called\nperformance glasses\nthat make people look like\ncyborgs, in my opinion,\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are the sort\nthat you could wear out to dinner\nor that you could wear to work.\nThey have a terrific aesthetic.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com,\nand enter the code huberman at checkout.\nLet's talk about alcohol,\nand let's just acknowledge\nthat human beings\nhave been consuming alcohol\nfor thousands of years.\nIf you look at the archeological\nevidence from Mesopotamia,\nyou'll find that 5,000 years\nago, people had wine vessels.\nOr if you want to know\nwhen people first started\ndistilling alcohol,\nmuch to people's surprise,\nthat did not first take place in Ireland,\nand that's not a joke about the Irish.\nYou'll see a lot of claims online\nthat the Irish were the\nfirst to distill alcohol,\nbut, in fact, they were not.\nIt was the Chinese that were\nthe first to distill alcohol,\nand that took place in\nChina in the first century.\nAlcohol has been used\nfor nutritional purposes,\nso there are cultures that believe,\nand indeed still believe,\nthat the calories in alcohol are useful,\nalthough later we'll talk\nabout how alcohol calories\nare indeed empty calories\nand what an empty calorie really\nis, why it's called empty.\nAlcohol has been used\nfor medicinal purposes\nbecause indeed it does kill bacteria,\nand, as you'll soon find out,\nthe fact that it kills bacteria,\nbecause that is absolutely true,\nit also kills the good\nbacteria in your gut,\nand the destruction of that\ngood bacteria in your gut\ncan lead to things like leaky gut syndrome\nand has all sorts of issues,\nand there are ways to\ndeal with those issues\nand we'll talk about those.\nSo alcohol has been used\nfor medicinal purposes,\nit's been used to clean surfaces,\nit's used in my laboratory\nin order to make up so-called reagents\nto do our experiments,\nbut most humans have\nbeen consuming alcohol\nin order to change their internal state,\nin order to feel differently\nthan they would otherwise.\nThat feeling of being drunk or inebriated\nor tipsy or lightheaded is something\nthat many, not all, but many\nhumans seem to enjoy and pursue\neven though, typically,\nit leads to a feeling\nof being less happy, less motivated,\nmore stressed, et cetera,\nwhen the alcohol wears off.\nThat's pretty incredible, right?\nI mean, we're talking about a substance\nthat people have been\nhighly motivated to pursue,\nthat are still highly motivated to pursue,\nto create and to consume,\nthat they'll spend money on,\nand that's despite the fact\nthat it makes them feel good\nand then it makes them feel lousy.\nNow, some of you might be saying,\n\"Well, I drink, but I\ndon't drink to excess\nand, therefore, I don't feel lousy.\nI feel good when I drink\nand then it wears off\nand it allows me to\nget through my evening,\nand then the next\nmorning I'm ready to go.\"\nOkay, that very well may be\ntrue, I believe those people,\nand, as I mentioned in the\nbeginning of the episode,\nI'm not here to demonize\nalcohol in any way.\nBut I do want to point out what alcohol is\nand how it creates the\neffects that it does,\nand then I want to talk\nabout what those effects are\nwhen you engage in consuming alcohol\neven as often as one\nor two nights per week,\nor let's say you're just\nsomebody who has a drink or two\non Friday, maybe a few more on Saturday,\nor maybe you're somebody who\nconsumes all your alcohol\none night per week or one night per month.\nWe'll talk about how that's\naffecting your biology.\nSo let's address what alcohol is\nand how it affects the cells and tissues\nand organs of your body.\nThen we'll take a look at\nsome of the epidemiology,\nthat is, how many people\nare consuming alcohol\nand how much they're drinking.\nAnd then you will be able,\nI think, to get a good sense\nof how the alcohol that you're drinking,\nif you're drinking any at all,\nis impacting your brain and body\nand the choices you might want to make\nabout how and when to drink alcohol,\nor even if you want to\neliminate alcohol altogether.\nOkay, so some basic chemistry\nand biology of alcohol,\nand, again, I'll make this very clear\neven if you don't have a\nchemistry and biology background.\nBecause of the structure of alcohol,\nit is what's called both\nwater-soluble and fat-soluble.\nTranslated into what's meaningful for you,\nwhat that means is when you drink alcohol,\nit can pass into all the cells\nand tissues of your body.\nIt has no trouble just passing\nright into those cells.\nSo unlike a lot of substances and drugs\nthat actually attach to\nthe surface of cells,\nto receptors, as they're\ncalled, little parking spots,\nand then trigger a bunch of downstreams,\nlike, domino cascades of effects,\nalcohol actually has its\nown direct effects on cells\nbecause it can really just\npass into those cells.\nSo it's water- and fat-soluble,\nand the fact that it can pass\ninto so many organs and cells so easily\nis really what explains\nits damaging effects.\nI should mention that there are\nthree main types of alcohol.\nThere's isopropyl,\nmethyl, and ethyl alcohol,\nand only the last one,\nethyl alcohol or ethanol,\nis fit for human consumption.\nHowever, it is still toxic, okay?\nIt produces substantial\nstress and damage to cells.\nI'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,\nbut that's just a fact.\nEthanol produces\nsubstantial damage to cells,\nand it does that because\nwhen you ingest ethanol,\nit has to be converted into something else\nbecause it is toxic to the body.\nAnd there's a molecule inside\nof all of us called NAD,\nand you may have heard of NAD\nbecause it's quite popular,\nthere's a lot of discussion about NAD\nin the longevity literature right now.\nNAD is present in all our\ncells from birth until death.\nThe levels of NAD tend to\ngo down across the lifespan.\nThere are ideas that\nincreasing levels of NAD\nmay extend lifespan.\nA lot of that is still controversial,\nor, at least we should say, is ongoing\nin terms of the research.\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,\nNAD and related biochemical pathways\nare involved in converting that ethanol\ninto something called acetaldehyde,\nit's broken down into acetaldehyde.\nAnd if you thought ethanol was bad,\nacetaldehyde is particularly bad.\nAcetaldehyde is poison.\nIt will kill cells.\nIt damages and kills cells\nand it is indiscriminate\nas to which cells it damages and kills.\nNow, that's a problem, obviously,\nand the body deals with that problem\nby using another component of\nthe NAD biochemical pathway\nto convert acetaldehyde into\nsomething called acetate.\nAcetate is actually something\nthat your body can use as fuel.\nAnd that process of going from ethanol\nto acetaldehyde to acetate\ndoes involve the production\nof a toxic molecule, right?\nAgain, acetaldehyde is really toxic.\nAnd NAD, and if we want to get technical,\nit's the NAD-to-NADH ratio,\nand that chemical step\nis the rate-limiting step\nto ethanol's metabolism.\nWhat does that mean for you?\nWhat that means is that if your body\ncan't do this conversion of ethanol\nto acetaldehyde to acetate fast enough,\nwell, acetaldehyde will\nbuild up in your body\nand cause more damage,\nso it's important that your body\nbe able to do this\nconversion very quickly.\nAnd the place where it does\nthat is within the liver,\nand cells within the liver\nare very good at this conversion process,\nbut they are cells and they\nare exposed to the acetaldehyde\nin the conversion process,\nand so cells within the\nliver really take a beating\nin the alcohol metabolism events.\nSo the key thing to understand here\nis that when you ingest alcohol,\nyou are, yes, ingesting a poison,\nand that poison is converted\ninto an even worse poison in your body,\nand some percentage of that worse poison\nis converted into a form of calories\nthat you can use to generate\nenergy, generate ATP.\nAnd the reason why alcohol\nis considered empty calories\nis because that entire process\nis very metabolically costly,\nbut there's no real nutritive value\nof the calories that it creates.\nYou can use it for immediate energy,\nbut it can't be stored\nin any kind of meaningful\nor beneficial way.\nIt doesn't provide any vitamins,\nit doesn't provide any amino acids,\nit doesn't provide any fatty acids,\nit's truly empty calories.\nI know some people talk about\nsugar is empty calories,\nbut sugar actually is a\nfar better fuel source\nthan alcohol or acetate.\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,\nsome percentage is being\nshuttled into a worse poison\nand some is being shuttled\ninto a fuel source.\nNow, the important thing to understand\nis that it is the poison,\nthe acetaldehyde itself,\nthat leads to the effect of\nbeing inebriated or drunk.\nI think most people don't realize that,\nthat being drunk is actually\na poison-induced disruption\nin the way that your neural circuits work.\nAnd so we should ask ourselves,\nlike, which neural\ncircuits, what brain areas,\nwhat body areas are involved\nin feeling drunk or inebriated?\nNow, in thinking about this\nstate of being tipsy or happy\nor really drunk or a little bit drunk,\nI want to mention something\nthat I think most people aren't aware of,\nand that's the fact that for people\nthat are regular drinkers\nor that have a genetic\npredisposition to alcoholism,\nwhen they drink, they tend\nto feel very energized\nand very good for longer periods of time.\nAgain, people who have a genetic\npredisposition to alcohol\nor people who are chronic drinkers\nor even just, if you recall,\nchronic doesn't have to\nmean a ton of alcohol\nbut they're drinking one or two per night\nor they're every other night type drinkers\nor Thursday through Sunday drinkers,\nthose people typically\nexperience an increase\nin alertness and mood when they drink,\nwhereas occasional drinkers\nwill have a briefer, meaning\nless long-lasting, period\nof feeling good when they drink\nand then more quickly\ntransition into a state\nin which they're tired or they\nstart losing motor skills,\nthey start slurring their speech.\nI also want to emphasize this\nis distinct from tolerance.\nWe'll talk about tolerance later\nand exactly what tolerance means.\nBut I really want to highlight the fact\nthat when people ingest this poison,\n'cause indeed it is poison,\nthe range of effects is very different,\nand you can reliably predict\nwho are the people with a\npredisposition to alcoholism\nand who are the people who\nare more regular drinkers\nby the contour or the timing\nof the different effects.\nAnd, again, people who tend\nto feel more alert and excited\nevery time they drink, they\ntend to get a real lift,\nthey become kind of the life of the party\nand that lasts a long while,\nthose people are the ones\nthat really have to be careful\nabout predisposition for alcoholism.\nAnd those people also need to be careful\nabout their drinking\nand the amount of drinking\nthat they're doing,\neven if they're not full-blown alcoholics.\nNow, of course, people\nwho are ingesting alcohol\nwho are not accustomed to drink alcohol\nhave to be concerned\nabout drinking alcohol\nfor other reasons,\nbecause it can impair motor function\nand judgment, et cetera.\nBut in thinking about the\nbiochemical effects of alcohol\nand what it's doing to the body,\nwhat it's doing in all cases\nis it's consumed into the gut, right?\nGoes into the stomach,\nthe liver immediately\nstarts this conversion\nthat we talked about before\nof ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate,\nand some amount of\nacetaldehyde and acetate\nare making it into the brain,\nit crosses the blood-brain barrier.\nAgain, the brain has this fence around it\nthat we call the blood-brain\nbarrier or the BBB.\nMany things, most things, thankfully,\ncan't pass across the blood-brain barrier,\nbut alcohol, because it's\nwater- and fat-soluble,\njust cruises right across this fence\nand into the milieu, the\nenvironment of the brain,\nwhich is made up of a couple\ndifferent major cell types,\nneurons, nerve cells, and\nso-called glial cells,\nwhich are in between the nerve cells,\nand we'll talk about the\neffects on each of those soon.\nSo what happens when\nalcohol gets into the brain\nthat makes us feel tipsy or drunk\nand, in some people, makes people\nfeel really especially\nenergized and happy?\nWell, alcohol is indiscriminate\nin terms of which brain areas it goes to.\nAgain, it doesn't bind\nto particular receptors,\nbut it does seem to have a propensity\nor an affinity for particular brain areas\nthat are involved in certain\nkinds of thinking and behavior.\nSo one of the first things that happens\nis that there's a slight,\nat least after the first\ndrink or second drink,\nthere's a slight suppression\nin the activity of neurons\nin the prefrontal cortex.\nThis is an area of your neocortex\nthat's involved in thinking and planning\nand, perhaps above all,\nin suppression of impulsive behavior.\nSo if you go to a party\nand they're serving alcohol\nand people are consuming drinks,\nwhat you'll notice is that a\nfew minutes into that party,\nthe volume of people's\nvoices will increase,\nand that's because people are\nsimply not paying attention\nto their voice modulation,\nand as other people start\nspeaking more loudly,\nother people are speaking more loudly.\nWe've all had this experience,\nright, of going to a party\nand then you step outside for a moment\nand you go, \"Oh, my\ngoodness, I was shouting.\"\nYou come home, the next day,\nyou've got a sore throat.\nIt might be that you\npicked up some sort of bug,\nsome virus or something,\nbut oftentimes it's just the fact\nthat you've been shouting\nall night just to be heard\nbecause as the prefrontal\ncortex shuts down,\npeople stop modulating their\nlevel of speech quite as much.\nYou also notice that people\nstart gesticulating more,\npeople will start standing\nup and sitting down more,\nthey'll start walking around more,\nif there's music on,\npeople might spontaneously start dancing.\nAll of this is because these\nareas of the prefrontal cortex\nnormally are providing what's\ncalled top-down inhibition.\nThey are releasing a\nneurotransmitter called GABA\nonto various parts of the\nbrain that are involved\nin impulsive motor behavior\nand thought patterns,\nand as you shut down\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nthat GABAergic suppression of impulses\nstarts to be released,\nso people will say things\nthat they want to say\nwithout so much forethought\nabout what they're saying,\nor they might do things\nthat they want to do\nwithout really thinking\nit through quite as much\nor they might not even remember\nthinking it through at all,\nor experience, I should say,\nthinking it through at all.\nWe haven't talked about blacking out yet\nand the effects of alcohol on memory,\nbut as long as we're there,\nI'll just tell you that alcohol\nhas a very strong effect\nin suppressing the neural networks\nthat are involved in memory\nformation and storage.\nThis is why oftentimes we\nforget the events of a night out\nif we've been drinking.\nOne of the more important things to know\nabout the effects of alcohol in the brain\nis this disruption in top-down inhibition,\nbut, also, that areas of the brain\nthat are involved in flexible behavior,\nsort of considering different options,\nlike I could do A or I could do B,\nI could say this to them\nor I could say that,\nI could say it in that way or\nI could say it in this way,\nthis might be a little more tactful,\nthose brain areas basically\nshut down entirely\nand people just tend to\nsay what they want to say.\nSo the key thing to understand\nis that when people drink,\nthe prefrontal cortex and\ntop-down inhibition is diminished,\nthat is, habitual behavior\nand impulsive behavior\nstarts to increase.\nNow, what's interesting is\nthis is true in the short term,\nso after people have one or\ntwo, maybe three or four drinks,\nbut it's also true that the\nmore often that people drink,\nthere are changes in the very circuits\nthat underlie habitual\nand impulsive behavior.\nThis is really important to highlight,\nso much so that I want to drill\ninto it a bit more deeply.\nFor the person that drinks,\nsay, every Thursday night\nor every Friday night\nor goes out only on\nSaturdays but every Saturday,\nthere's evidence that there are changes\nin the neural circuits of the brain\nthat control habitual behavior\nand impulsive behavior,\nand they are modified\nand strengthened in ways\nthat make those people more\nhabitual and more impulsive\noutside the times in\nwhich they are drinking,\nand when they drink, impulsive\nand habitual behavior\ntends to increase even further.\nThis is something that's\nnot often talked about\nwhen discussing the effects of alcohol.\nI mean, we all know the\neffects of being drunk\ncan be bad, right?\nCan be bad in terms of\njudgment, motor coordination,\ncertainly driving drunk\nis a terrible thing,\nget you or other people killed and so on.\nBut rarely do we hear about\nthe changes in neural circuits\nfrom just one or two\nnights of regular drinking.\nAgain, chronic drinking\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nevery day and every night.\nIt could be the person that simply drinks\nevery Thursday or every Friday\nor just once a week has\nthree or four drinks\nor maybe even a few more.\nThat person is going to\nexperience a decrease\nin this top-down inhibition,\nso an increase in impulsivity\nand habitual behavior,\nbecause the brake on those behaviors\nhas been removed while they're drinking,\nbut also changes in the\nvery neural circuits\nthat allow habitual and impulsive behavior\nto occur more readily even\nwhen they're not drinking.\nAnd if you want to know the\nactual substrate for that,\nthe cellular substrate, I\ncan briefly describe it.\nIt's really interesting.\nAgain, you don't need to know any biology\nto understand this.\nWhat it does is it increases\nthe number of synapses,\nthe actual points of connection\nin the neural circuits\nthat control habitual behavior.\nSo there's literally a growth\nof the neural circuits in your brain\nthat lead to existing\nhabit execution, all right,\nthe performance of things\nyou already know how to do,\nand a reduction in the neural circuits,\nor I should say a reduction\nin the number of\nsynapses, of the contacts,\nwithin the neural circuits\nthat are controlling behavior.\nSo this, again, is a not\noften discussed aspect\nof alcohol intake.\nFortunately, it is reversible.\nSo in animals or humans\nthat undertake a period of abstinence\nof anywhere from two to six months,\nthese neural circuits return to normal\nexcept in cases where people\nhave been chronically drinking\nlarge volumes of alcohol\nfor many, many years.\nAnd in those cases,\nwhile there is some\nrecovery of brain circuitry\nafter people get sober,\nmeaning completely sober,\nthey stop drinking entirely,\nthere is evidence of long-lasting impact\nof heavy alcohol usage\nthroughout the lifespan.\nBut, of course, this\ndoesn't mean that anyone\nthat's suffering from\nalcoholism or that used to\nshould not continue to\nfocus on their health.\nYou absolutely should. All is not lost.\nBut for people that have been\ndrinking for a lot of years,\nmaybe you went to college and\nyou drank a lot in those years\nand your neural circuits changed,\nif there's a period in which\nyou don't drink alcohol,\nagain, from two to six\nmonths and ideally longer,\nthose neural circuits\ncan then be remodified\nback to their original state.\nSo let's consider some of the\nother neurochemical effects\nof alcohol in the brain and body.\nAnd, again, for right now,\nwe're confining the conversation to people\nthat are drinking, on average,\none or two drinks per night.\nNow, some people might think\nthat two drinks per night is a lot,\nand a lot of that will\ndepend on body weight.\nSo for instance, people\nwho weigh 110 pounds,\nfor them to ingest two alcoholic drinks\nis going to be substantially different\nin terms of the biochemical effects\nthan somebody who weighs 220 pounds.\nOf course tolerance will\nalso factor into this,\ngenetic background will\nalso factor into this,\nand indeed whether or\nnot people have eaten\nwill factor into this,\nso there are a lot of factors\nand we'll talk about that.\nFor the time being, if you're curious\nabout how food impacts\nthe effects of alcohol\nand your feelings of being drunk,\nyou may have heard, for instance,\nthat if somebody's inebriated\nand they want to sober up,\nthey should eat something.\nTurns out that does not work.\nHere's how it does work, however.\nIf you eat something\nprior to drinking alcohol\nor while ingesting alcohol,\nit will slow the absorption of\nalcohol into the bloodstream.\nIn other words, you won't\nfeel as drunk as fast,\nfor many of you, this\nprobably comes as no surprise,\nin particular, if that meal\nincludes carbohydrates,\nfats, and proteins, okay?.\nThe inclusion of all\nthree major macronutrients\nseems to slow the absorption\nof alcohol into the bloodstream\nfar more than having any one of those\nor two of those macronutrients present.\nNow, if you are already inebriated\nor you've had a glass of wine or a beer\nand you eat something,\nchances are that alcohol\nhas already made it\ninto your bloodstream\nbecause it moves into the\nbloodstream so quickly.\nAgain, it's fat-soluble and water-soluble,\nso within minutes, right?\nIf you have an empty stomach,\nwithin five to 10 minutes,\nthat alcohol is going to\nbe within your bloodstream\nand distributed throughout your body,\nmaybe even faster depending\non the type of alcohol\nand your metabolism.\nBut if you're already drunk\nand you eat something,\nit's not going to sober\nyou up more quickly,\nbut it certainly will blunt the effects\nof any additional alcohol\nthat you might consume.\nAnd if you're somebody who is concerned\nabout getting too drunk too quick,\neven from a small amount of alcohol,\nhaving some food in your gut\ncan certainly be beneficial.\nNow, that's food and alcohol\nand the absorption of alcohol,\nbut let's go back to talking\nabout the biochemical\nand neurochemical effects\nof alcohol on the brain.\nWe talked about top-down inhibition,\nand we talked about habitual\nand impulsive behavior circuitry.\nThere are also dramatic changes\nin the activity of neurons\nthat control the release\nof so-called serotonin.\nSerotonin is a neuromodulator.\nIt changes the activity of neural circuits\nand many neural circuits,\nin particular, those involved in mood\nand feelings of well-being.\nRecently, there's been a\nlot of interest in serotonin\nbecause of a study that was released\nthat showed pretty conclusively\nthat serotonin levels can't\nreally explain depression\nand depression-like symptoms.\nI want to make it very clear\nthat although that study did\nshow that serotonin levels\nare not necessarily\nassociated with depression,\nthe study was interpreted\nby many to mean that SSRIs,\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\nwhich have the net effect\nof increasing serotonins,\nthese are things like Prozac, et cetera,\nthat those drugs are somehow not helpful\nbecause they increase serotonin\nand serotonin isn't\ninvolved in depression.\nThat logic doesn't really hold together\nso I'm going to use this as an opportunity\nto just clarify what\nreally occurred there,\nand then we'll talk about how serotonin\nrelates to alcohol consumption\nin things like feeling\ngood and in depression.\nThe key thing is this, SSRIs\ncan help alleviate depression.\nThat's right. SSRIs can\nhelp alleviate depression.\nThey are often, not always,\nassociated with side effects,\ndosage is very important, et cetera.\nBut they probably support\nrelief from depression\nby changing neural circuits,\nnot necessarily by\nincreasing serotonin itself.\nThat is, increasing\nserotonin with these drugs\nlikely changed the neural\ncircuits involved in mood,\nallowing people to feel better\nthrough so-called neuroplasticity,\nwhich is the brain's\nability to change itself\nin response to experience.\nSo there's a bit of confusion,\nand, again, I'm using\nthis episode on alcohol\nto highlight some of the confusion\nbecause I think it's timely,\nbecause the study just came out\nand there's a lot of\nchatter about this out there\nthat when people are depressed,\nit's not necessarily because\nserotonin levels are low.\nHowever, if serotonin levels are increased\nwith things like Prozac,\nZoloft, and other SSRIs,\noftentimes there is, yes,\na relief from depression,\nbut that's probably not\nbecause of restoring\nserotonin levels, per se.\nIt's probably because serotonin\nfacilitates the changes\nin neural circuits that need to occur\nin order for people to\nfeel elevated mood, okay?\nSo, again, that's a bit\nof a tangent and aside,\nbut I do think it's a vital\none for people to know about.\nAgain, if you're thinking\nabout taking SSRIs\nor you're currently taking them\nand you've heard this news,\ndefinitely talk to your doctor.\nAgain, there is great utility\nfor some of these SSRIs,\nand, also, in conditions like OCD,\nthey've been shown to be very beneficial,\nso we really don't want to throw SSRIs out\nas a potentially valuable treatment.\nGetting back to the effects\nof alcohol on serotonin,\nit's very clear, beyond any doubt,\nthat many of the circuits in the brain\nthat are involved in mood\nand feelings of well-being\nand also sort of self-image\nand how we see ourselves\nemploy the neuromodulator serotonin,\nand alcohol, when we ingest it\nand it's converted into acetaldehyde,\nit goes and that\nacetaldehyde acts as a toxin\nat the very synapses,\nthe connections between\nthese serotonergic neurons\nand lots of other neurons.\nIn other words, when we ingest alcohol,\nthe toxic effects of alcohol\ndisrupt those mood circuitries,\nat first making them hyperactive.\nThat's right, making them hyperactive.\nThis is why people\nbecome really talkative,\npeople start to feel really good\nafter a few sips of alcohol,\nat least most people do.\nAnd then as they ingest more alcohol\nor as that alcohol wears off,\nserotonin levels and the\nactivity of those circuits\nreally starts to drop, and\nthat's why people feel less good.\nAnd typically what they do,\nthey go and get another drink\nand they attempt to kind\nof restore that feeling\nof well-being and mood.\nNow, typically what happens\nis that as people ingest\nthe third and fourth,\nmaybe even the fifth drink,\nthere's an absolute zero chance\nof them recovering that\nenergized mood, right?\nMost people, as they drink more and more,\nwill now start to feel\nmore and more suppressed.\nThe forebrain is now\nshutting down quite a lot,\na lot of the motor cortical areas\nthat control coordinated movement\nand deliberate movement\nstart to shut down,\nso people start to slur their speech,\npeople start to shuffle their feet,\npeople forget their posture,\npeople start to lean on things,\npeople start passing out on couches.\nThere's a great depression,\nnot depression of the\npsychiatric depression sort,\nbut a depression of alertness and arousal,\nand eventually people will pass out.\nNow, I said most people\nbecause there's a subset of\npeople that have gene variants\nor who are chronic drinkers\nor who are chronic drinkers\nand have gene variants\nthat, as they ingest the third and fourth\nand fifth drink, what happens?\nThey become more alert,\nthey start talking more,\nthey feel great, they\nhave all sorts of ideas\nabout the fun they could have that night.\nAnd they're the ones that,\nif you've ever fallen asleep\nat a party for whatever reason,\nor you're getting tired\nand you're yawning,\nyou're looking around the room\nand, like, these people are\nstill drinking and partying\nand they're having what seems\nto be this amazing time,\noften, not always,\nthose are the future\nalcoholics in the room,\nor those are the people\nthat have a genetic\npredisposition for alcoholism,\nor those are the chronic drinkers,\nthe people who have built\nup enough of a tolerance\nor who have the chemical genetic makeup\nsuch that increasing amounts of alcohol\nmake them feel better\nand better and better.\nAnd of course, they, too, have a threshold\nbeyond which their nervous system\nwill start to get diminished\nand they'll pass out,\nfall over, et cetera,\nbut that threshold is way, way higher\nthan it is for most people.\nNow, this is important to understand,\nand it's important to understand\nbecause I think everyone should know\nand recognize their own predisposition\nand kind of risk in terms\nof developing alcoholism.\nIt's also important to understand\nbecause it relates to the\nphenomenon of blackout.\nMany people think that\nblacking out is passing out,\nbut blackout drunk is when people drink\nand they're talking and doing things,\nsometimes, sadly or tragically,\nthey'll often drive home or walk home\nor they'll hop on a bicycle and ride home\nor they'll go swimming in the ocean,\nall, of course, very\ndangerous activities to do\nwhen people are really drunk,\nor even a little bit drunk in some cases.\nSo these people will do\nthese sorts of things\nand they do them because they\nhave the energy to do them\nand they feel good while doing them,\nbut they are doing them\nwhile the activity of\nneurons in the hippocampus,\nwhich is involved in memory formation,\nare completely shut off.\nAnd this is why the\nnext day, you tell them,\n\"Hey, maybe we should talk\nabout what happened last night.\"\nLike, \"What happened last night?\"\nYou said, \"Well, do you\nremember going to the party?\"\n\"Yeah, I know, it was great.\nWe did this, we did this.\"\n\"And then what?\"\nAnd it's very clear all of a sudden\nthat they have no recollection\nof all the things they were\ndoing despite being awake.\nNow, I wish I could tell you\nthat there's some sort of\nblood test or other biomarker\nor even a fingerprint\ntest that would allow you\nto determine whether or\nnot you have a propensity\nto be one of these drinkers\nthat has a predisposition for alcoholism.\nAnd if you've ever been blackout drunk,\nand certainly if you've\nbeen blackout drunk\nmore than a few times, you\nshould be quite concerned.\nAnd as we talk more about\nthe more chronic effects\nand long-lasting effects\nof alcohol consumption\na little bit later in the episode,\nI think it'll become clear\nas to why you should be concerned.\nBut in any case, there is\nsomething that can tell you\nwhether or not you might\nbe in that category\nversus likely not in that category,\nand I alluded to this a\ncouple of times already,\nbut I want to be really\nclear that when people drink,\nno matter who you are,\ninitially, there's that shutting down\nof those prefrontal cortical circuits,\nthere's a gradual shutting down\nof the circuits that control memory,\nbut then people divide\ninto these two bins.\nAnd these two bins\nare the people who, after\nmore than a couple of drinks,\nstart to feel sedated,\nand the people who, after\nmore than a few drinks,\ndo not start to feel sedated.\nNow, of course there's\ngoing to be differences\ncreated by how quickly\npeople are drinking,\nwhether or not they're combining\ndifferent types of alcohol,\nthe types of alcohol, et cetera,\nbut in general, that can predict\nwhether or not you're somebody\nwho has a predisposition\nfor alcoholism or not.\nOne also very interesting finding\nis that alcohol changes the relationship\nbetween what's called the hypothalamus\nand the pituitary gland and the adrenals.\nNow, the hypothalamus is a\nsmall collection of neurons\nabout the size of a large gumball\nthat sits above the roof of your mouth,\nand it houses neurons that are responsible\nfor some incredible aspects of\nour behavior and our mindset,\nthings like rage, things like sex drive,\nthings like temperature regulation,\nvery primitive functions,\nincluding appetite, thirst, et cetera.\nAlcohol, because it can\ngo anywhere in the brain,\nremember it's water- and fat-soluble,\nhas effects on the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus normally\nprovides very specific signals\nto what's called the pituitary gland.\nThis is a little gland\nthat actually sticks out of the brain,\nbut it receives instructions\nfrom the hypothalamus.\nAnd then the pituitary releases hormones\ninto the bloodstream that go\nand talk to your adrenals,\nand your adrenal gland sit\nright above your kidneys\nin your lower back.\nAnd the adrenals release, as\nthe name suggests, adrenaline,\nalso called epinephrine,\nand also a molecule called cortisol,\nwhich is involved in the kind\nof longer-term stress response\nand it has some healthy effects,\ntoo, on the immune system.\nOkay, so the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,\nI know that's a mouthful,\nyou don't need to remember the names,\nbut the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis\nmaintains your physiological balance\nof what you perceive as stressful\nand what you don't perceive as stressful.\nPeople who drink regularly,\nso this, again, could be just\none or two drinks per night\nor it could be somebody\nthat drinks just on Fridays\nor just on Saturdays or\nmaybe just on the weekend,\ntwo to four drinks,\nwell, those people experience changes\nin their\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis\nthat result in more cortisol,\nmore of this so-called stress hormone,\nbeing released at baseline,\nwhen they are not drinking.\nThis is really important.\nPeople who drink a bit,\nand when I say a bit, I\ndon't mean one or two sips\nor even a glass of wine\nevery once in a while.\nI mean, again, people that are maybe\nhaving one drink a night with dinner\nand maybe on the weekend a few more.\nAgain, I offer a bunch of\ndifferent patterns to explain\nhow it could also be two\nor three drinks on Friday\nor six drinks only on Saturday.\nWell, all of those groups\nexperience increases\nin cortisol release from\ntheir adrenal glands\nwhen they are not drinking,\nand as a consequence,\nthey feel more stressed\nand more anxiety when\nthey aren't drinking.\nThis is a seldom talked\nabout effect of alcohol\nbecause so often we hear\nabout the immediate\neffects of alcohol, right?\nAnd we've been talking\nabout some of those effects,\neffects like reducing\nthe amount of stress.\nI mean, how many times\nhave we heard somebody say,\n\"Ugh, I need a drink.\"\nAnd then they have a drink and\nthey're, like, calmed down,\nnow they can shake off the\nthoughts about the day's work\nthey can start to think about things\nin a maybe more grounded or rational way,\nor at least they believe that,\nor they can somehow just relax themselves.\nWell, while that very well may be true,\nthat it can relax them,\nwhen they are not drinking,\nthat level of cortisol\nthat's released at baseline\nhas increased substantially.\nAgain, this relates to\na defined neural circuit\nbetween brain and body,\nand it has to do with\nthe ratio of cortisol\nto some of the other hormones\ninvolved in the stress response.\nWe'll provide a reference to the study\nthat describes how all of this works\nfor those of you that really\nwant to delve into it,\nbut let's go back to this issue\nof those who are prone to alcoholism\nversus those who are not.\nRemember, there are people\nwho have genetic variants,\nmeaning genes that they\ninherited from their parents,\nthat make it more likely that\nthey will become alcoholics.\nBut there are also people who drink often\nwho start to experience\nthis increase in alertness\nthe longer they drink across the night.\nPart of that effect, we\nthink, is because of changes\nin this\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\nSo alcohol is kind of a\ndouble hit in this sense.\nIt's causing changes\nin our brain circuitry\nand neurochemistry that,\nat the time in which we're\ninebriated, are detrimental,\nand it's causing changes in\nneural circuitry that persist\nlong past the time in which\nwe're experiencing the feeling\nof being tipsy or drunk.\nNow, again, I don't want\nto demonize alcohol.\nI'm not saying, oh, you know,\nif you have a glass of wine now and again\nor you drink a beer now and again\nor even have, you know, a\nmixed drink now and again\nor a shot that that's\nnecessarily terrible for you.\nI certainly do not want\nthat to be the message.\nWhat I'm saying is that if people\nare ingesting alcohol chronically,\neven if it's not every night,\nthere are well-recognized\nchanges in neural circuits,\nthere are well-recognized changes\nin neurochemistry within the brain,\nand there are well-recognized changes\nin the brain-to-body stress system\nthat generally point in three directions,\nincreased stress when\npeople are not drinking,\ndiminished mood and feelings of well-being\nwhen people are not drinking,\nand, as you'll soon learn,\nchanges in the neural circuitry\nthat cause people to\nwant to drink even more\nin order to get just back to baseline\nor the place that they were\nin terms of their stress modulation\nand in terms of their feelings of mood\nbefore they ever started\ndrinking in the first place.\nSo again, I don't want\nto demonize alcohol,\nbut I do want to emphasize\nthat there are long-term plastic changes,\nmeaning changes in neural\ncircuitry and hormone circuitry,\nthat, across a period of several months\nand certainly across a period of years\nof the sorts of drinking\npatterns I described,\nwhich I think, for most people,\nare going to sound, like,\npretty typical, right?\nI mean, nothing that I described so far\nwas about drinking a case a night\nor about binging on alcohol\nin the way that we often\nhear about it in the news.\nThese are pretty common\npatterns of alcohol consumption.\nI mean, all you have to do is\nboard a transatlantic flight\nor actually go to an airport\non a Sunday afternoon\nin a sunny area of the US\nand, you know, people are\nhaving three, four, five,\nsix beers, et cetera.\nAgain, personal choice is personal choice.\nI'm not telling you what to do.\nBut it's very clear that those\nsorts of drinking patterns\nare changing neural circuitry\nand they're changing hormone circuitry,\nand I'd love to be able to tell you\nthat they're changing them for the better,\nbut they simply are not.\nThey're actually changing\nthem for the worse,\nand worse is defined as making people\nless resilient to stress,\nhigher levels of baseline\nstress, and lower mood overall.\nBefore we continue with\ntoday's discussion,\nI'd like to just briefly\nacknowledge our sponsor,\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1.\nAthletic Greens, AKA AG1,\nis an all-in-one vitamin,\nmineral, probiotic drink\nthat also has adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since way back in 2012\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still drink\nAthletic Greens twice a day\nis that it supplies total\nfoundational coverage\nof my vitamin and mineral needs,\nand it supplies important\nnutrients that I need\nto support my gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome, as many of you know,\nsupports the immune system.\nIt also supports the\nso-called gut-brain axis,\nwhich is vital for mood,\nfor energy levels, for regulating focus,\nand many other features\nof our mental health and physical health\nthat impact our daily\nperformance and high performance\nin any endeavors we might be involved in.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away\nfive free travel packs,\nplus a year's supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 with every order.\nAnd, of course, vitamin D3 K2 are vital\nfor all sorts of things\nlike hormone health and metabolic health\nand K2 for cardiovascular\nhealth and calcium regulation.\nAgain, you can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nNow, I've been talking a little bit\nabout genetic predisposition,\nbut there are a couple of important points\nI'd like to make about that.\nFirst of all, what sorts\nof genes are involved\nin setting someone down the\npath of alcoholism or not?\nWell, it should come as no surprise\nthat the genes that chronic\nalcohol usage modifies,\nthey tend to fall\nprimarily in the pathways\nrelated to genetic control\nover serotonin receptors,\nGABA receptors, remember\nthat top-down inhibition\nand the involvement of GABA,\nand, no surprise, the HPA,\nthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\nAll of those, of course\ncombined with environment,\nthey combine with\npatterns of abuse, right,\nwe know that if you're in a social setting\nwhere a lot of people are drinking,\nthe likelihood that you're\ngoing to drink is much higher,\nsocial pressures, trauma, right?\nSome people will use\nalcohol to self-medicate\nto try and turn off their thinking\nor to deal with trauma, et cetera.\nSo they combine with the environment,\nbut the genes that are in\nthe serotonin synthesis\nand receptor synthesis\npathway, GABA and HPA axis,\ncombine with environmental pressures\nto give rise to alcohol use disorders.\nSo there's a fairly coherent picture\nthat we have here, right?\nThis is not a case where, for instance,\npeople that have a lot of the enzyme\nfor metabolizing alcohol,\nwhich we'll talk about in a\nminute, alcohol dehydrogenase,\nit's not like they are\nnecessarily the people\nthat become alcoholics,\nwhereas certainly in certain cultures,\ncertain Asian cultures in particular,\nthere are gene differences\nthat lead them to have low\nlevels of alcohol dehydrogenase.\nThere are actually people\nwho have so little alcohol dehydrogenase\nthat when they ingest alcohol,\nthey get very red and they just feel sick.\nSo if you're somebody\nthat has a sip of alcohol\nand you just feel horrible,\nit makes you feel nauseous,\nchances are you have gene\nvariants that create a situation\nwhere you're not making very\nmuch alcohol dehydrogenase.\nYou just simply can't metabolize alcohol\nso you just get a rapid buildup\nof the toxic effects of\nalcohol, the acetaldehyde,\nyou're not converting it\ninto those empty calories.\nBut in cultures where you\nhave a lot of genetic variants\nand genes expressed in people\nwhere they have a lot of\nalcohol dehydrogenase,\nsure, they can drink more,\nand they're converting\nmore of that alcohol\nfrom its toxic form to a non-toxic form,\nand, yes, of course, you\nwill observe more alcoholism\nin those communities because\nthey're drinking more,\nbut I do want to emphasize\nthat the environmental factors\nare playing a strong role there, too,\nbecause if you can drink more,\nyou're likely to drink more.\nIf you're somebody that feels sick\nimmediately from drinking,\nit's likely that you're\nnot going to engage\nin alcohol consumption,\nespecially if these things\nare genetically related,\nand, of course, genes and culture\nand location in the world\ntend to run together.\nSo do you have the gene for alcoholism?\nWell, there isn't one single gene.\nChances are if you have\nan immediate relative\nwho's a chronic abuser of alcohol\nor several relatives who are\nchronic abusers of alcohol,\nwell, that's going to predispose\nyou to be an alcoholic.\nBut since you don't know\nwhich genes you express\nunless you do genetic testing,\nand those things are available\nbut most people aren't doing that,\nthis assay, if you will,\nand it's not an assay, as we say,\nan assay is a test that you run in the lab\nto determine something,\nand it's not one that I recommend\nthat you go drink in order to do,\nbut if you've noticed\nthat you or somebody else\nis somebody who can drink\na lot throughout the night\nand have increased energy\nand can just drink and drink and drink,\nand especially if there's\nblackout episodes,\nnot remembering things the next day\ndespite being alert throughout\nthe entire night and so on,\nwell, then I would be very concerned\nthat you might actually\nhave a genetic variant\npredisposing you to alcoholism.\nThe other thing that predisposes people\nto abuse of alcohol is age.\nPeople who start drinking at younger ages\nare greatly predisposed to\ndeveloping alcohol dependence\nregardless of your family\nhistory of alcoholism.\nOkay, so I'm going to repeat that.\nPeople who start drinking younger\nare at great risk for\ndeveloping alcoholism\neven if they don't have\nalcoholism in their family.\nNow, of course, you don't\nhave to be an epidemiologist\nto understand that if you grow\nup in a family of drinkers\nand alcohol is everywhere,\nand especially if there's peer pressure\nor lack of oversight,\nthen there's going to\nbe a higher tendency,\nor a higher probability, I should say,\nthat you will start\ndrinking at a younger age.\nHowever, even people that grow up\nnowhere near their relatives,\nif they start drinking at a young age,\nso for instance, at 13\nor younger or 14 or 15,\nthere's a much higher probability\nthat they're going to develop\na long-lasting dependence on alcohol.\nPeople who take their\nfirst sip of alcohol later,\n15, 16, or one would hope even later,\nI can say one would hope\n'cause I'm now of that, you\nknow, age and generation\nwhere, you know, you\nthink about all the things\nthat young people do,\nand you go, \"Oh, gosh,\nif they only would wait or\nif they only would abstain.\"\nYou know? It's just what happens.\nI don't know, there's some\nneural circuit for that\nthat I can't explain yet.\nBut people who, for instance,\ndrink only once they reach\nlegal age of drinking,\nwhich in the US, I believe in\nevery state is 21 years old,\nif they take their first drink at 21,\nthe probability that they'll go on\nto develop full-blown alcohol dependence\nor alcohol use disorder, as\nit's called, AUD, is very low.\nNow, a subset of them will\nbecause they have such a\nstrong genetic predisposition\nor maybe life circumstances\ncreate a pattern\nin which they become a chronic drinker.\nBut I found this very interesting.\nGenes matter, but also the age\nin which somebody starts\ndrinking really matters.\nNow, whether or not that's\nbecause there are changes\nin neural circuitry as a\nconsequence of that drinking\nthat make people want to seek\nout more and more alcohol,\nor whether or not there's\nsome other effect,\nmaybe it's a change in\nhormones, et cetera,\nthat predisposes those young drinkers\nto become chronic drinkers or\neven full-blown alcoholics,\ncertainly developing alcohol use disorder.\nThere's a definition for\nthat. We can talk about it.\nIt involves the amount of drinking\nover a certain period of time, et cetera.\nSo it's very clear that\ndrinking early in life\ncreates a propensity for the development\nof alcohol use disorder later in life.\nAnd while there is a genetic component\nto developing alcohol use disorder,\nI find it very interesting\nthat if people who have\nthose gene variants\ndelay their onset of drinking,\nwell, then the probability\nthat they'll develop\nfull-blown alcohol use\ndisorder drops as well.\nSo again, it's genes and environments.\nIt's not an either/or\nand there's no single gene for alcoholism.\nWell, I promise you I will also talk\nabout some of the documented\npositive effects of alcohol.\nAlthough they are very few and\nfar between, they do exist.\nBut before I do that, I would be remiss\nif I didn't emphasize some\nmore of the terrible things\nthat alcohol does and\nthe way that it does it.\nAnd for those of you that enjoy alcohol,\nagain, I'd like to say I feel\nguilty about telling you this\nbecause I know how much some\npeople enjoy a good drink\nevery once in a while,\nand I say a good drink\nbecause some people do\nlike the taste of alcohol.\nI suppose I lucked out\nin that I don't really\nlike the taste of alcohol\nand that it just puts me to sleep,\nbut I know that people do enjoy it.\nAnd I do want to point out\nthat there is zero evidence\nthat, you know, provided\nsomebody is of drinking age,\ncertainly not in the stage\nof brain development,\nthat having one drink or two\ndrinks every now and again,\nmeaning every three or\nfour weeks or once a month,\nthat is not going to cause\nmajor health concerns\nor major health issues for most people.\nI suppose if you have zero\nor very little alcohol dehydrogenase,\nit might make you feel sick,\nbut then you're probably\nnot the kind of person\nthat's going to be drinking at all.\nSo, again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,\nI'm not trying to take them\naway from you by any means,\nbut you should know what drinking does\nif you're consuming it\nin this kind of typical chronic pattern,\nas we can now refer to it,\nwhich is that one or two a night\nor a few stacked up on Friday\nand maybe three or four on Saturday,\nthis kind of pattern of\ndrinking, which is quite common.\nAnd one of the more serious effects\nthat we should think about\nis the impact on the\nso-called gut-brain axis,\nor for sake of today's discussion,\nthe gut-liver-brain axis.\nI don't think the gut-liver-brain axis\nhas ever been discussed on this\npodcast, maybe any podcast.\nAlthough at the moment I say that,\nyou know, the gut-liver-brain axis,\npeople are going to come after me\nwith, I suppose, gut, liver, and brains.\nIn any event, you have\na brain. You have a gut.\nThat gut runs from your throat\ndown to the end of your intestine.\nYour gut and your brain communicate\nby way of nerve cells,\nneurons and nerve connections,\nthe vagus nerve in particular,\nand by way of chemical signaling.\nYour gut also communicates\nby way of chemical signaling\nand, believe it or not,\nby way of neural signaling,\ntoo, to your liver.\nAnd, as we talked about earlier,\nthe liver is the first\nsite in which alcohol\nis broken down or metabolized\ninto its component parts.\nThe liver is also\ncommunicating with the brain\nthrough chemical signaling\nand neural signaling,\nso we have the gut-liver-brain axis.\nAnd what you find\nis that people who ingest\nalcohol at any amount\nare inducing a disruption in\nthe so-called gut microbiome,\nthe trillions of little microbacteria\nthat take resident in your gut\nand that live inside you all the time\nand that help support your immune system\nand that literally signal\nby way of electrical signals\nand chemical signals to your brain\nto increase the release of things\nlike serotonin and dopamine\nand regulate your mood\ngenerally in positive ways.\nWell, alcohol really\ndisrupts those bacteria,\nand this should come as no surprise.\nI mean, earlier, we talked\nabout this and it's well known,\nif you want to, you know,\nsterilize something,\nyou want to kill the bacteria,\nyou pour alcohol on it.\nAnd I can remember scraping\nmyself or cutting myself\nor I was always injuring\nmyself when I was a kid,\nand, you know, the moment\nthey take out the peroxide,\nyou're like, \"Oh, boy, here it comes.\"\nBut if there's no peroxide around\nand you've got a wound there\nand you need to clean it out,\nyeah, they'll use alcohol,\nwhich I do not recommend, by the way.\nThat's one of the harshest\nways to clean a wound.\nBut for centuries,\nthousands of years really,\nalcohol has been used\nin order to clean things\nand kill bacteria.\nSo alcohol kills bacteria\nand it is indiscriminate\nwith respect to which bacteria it kills,\nso when we ingest alcohol\nand it goes into our gut,\nit kills a lot of the\nhealthy gut microbiota.\nAt the same time, the metabolism\nof alcohol in the liver,\nwhich you now understand,\nthat pathway involving NAD,\nacetaldehyde, and acetate,\nthat pathway is proinflammatory,\nso it's increasing the release\nof inflammatory cytokines,\nthings like IL-6, et cetera,\ntumor necrosis factor alpha.\nIf you'd like to learn more\nabout the immune system,\nwe did an episode all\nabout the immune system.\nYou can find it at hubermanlab.com.\nIt'll teach you all the\nbasics of what are cytokines,\nwhat are mast cells, et cetera.\nIn any event, all these\nproinflammatory molecules,\nthose are being released.\nYou've now got disruption\nof the gut microbiota.\nAs a consequence, the lining\nof the gut is disrupted,\nand you develop, at least\ntransiently, leaky gut.\nThat is, bacteria that exists in the gut\nwhich are bad bacteria\ncan now pass out of the\ngut into the bloodstream,\nso you've got a two-hit\nkind of model here.\nIn biology, we talk about two-hit models,\nthat is, it's kind of a\none plus one equals four,\nand it's generally when you hear two-hit,\nit's not a good thing.\nSo you've got bad bacteria\nfrom partially broken down food\nmoving out of the gut,\nthe good bacteria in the\ngut have been killed.\nYou might say, why doesn't the alcohol\nkill the bad bacteria in the gut?\nWell, the bad bacteria that are\nfrom partially digested food\noftentimes escape the gut\nbefore the alcohol can disrupt them,\nand so now you've got\nleaks in the gut wall,\nyou've got the release\nof this bad bacteria,\nyou've got inflammatory cytokines\nand other things being\nreleased from the liver,\nand they are able to get into the brain\nthrough what's called a\nneuroimmune signaling.\nAnd what's really bizarre,\nin terms of the way that\nthis manifests in the brain,\nI mean, it's not the\nway I would've done it,\nbut then again, as I always say,\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase,\nand anyone who says they did,\nyou should be very skeptical of them.\nThe net effect of this\nis actually to disrupt the neural circuits\nthat control regulation of alcohol intake,\nand the net effect of that is\nincreased alcohol consumption.\nSo this is just terrible, right?\nI mean, so you take in something\nthat disrupts two systems,\nthe gut microbiota, and\nit disrupts in two ways,\nit's killing the good gut microbiota\nand it's allowing the bad bacteria\nto move from the gut into the bloodstream,\nyou've also got proinflammatory cytokines\ncoming from the liver,\nand those converge or arrive in the brain\nand create a system in\nwhich the neural circuits\ncause more drinking.\nThat's a bad situation.\nAnd this is why people\nwho drink regularly,\neven if it's not a ton of alcohol,\nagain, of the sorts of\npatterns of drinking\nI talked about before,\nand certainly for those that\nare chronic heavy drinkers,\nwhat you end up with is a situation\nin which you have inflammation\nin multiple places in the brain and body\nand the desire to drink even more\nand to further exacerbate\nthat inflammation\nand the gut leakiness.\nSo this is basically a terrible scenario\nfor the gut-liver-brain axis,\nand it's especially prevalent\nin so-called alcohol use disorder,\nagain, people that are ingesting\nsomewhere between 12\nand 24 drinks per week.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin learning more about\nthe gut-liver-brain axis\nand, in particular, alcohol use disorder,\nI'll provide a link in\nthe show note captions.\nThere's a wonderful review\non this that details that.\nBut on the positive side,\nit points to the possibility\nthat at least some,\nagain, at least some,\nof the negative effects\nof alcohol consumption,\nwhether or not you're somebody\nwho's currently ingesting alcohol\nor who used to ingest alcohol\nand is trying to so-called\nrepair these systems\nof the brain and body,\nwhether or not replenishing\nthe gut microbiota\nis going to be beneficial.\nAnd we know that there\nare ways to do that,\nand we know that there's\nat least some promise\nfor the ability for this\nsystem to repair itself.\nHow does one do that?\nWell, I've talked before\nabout this on the podcast,\nbut studies done by colleagues\nof mine at Stanford,\nJustin Sonnenburg, who's been\non this podcast as a guest,\nan amazing episode all\nabout the gut microbiome,\nand his collaborator, Chris Gardner,\nalso at Stanford School of Medicine,\nhave explored not alcoholism,\nbut what are ways to\nimprove the gut microbiota,\nin particular, to reduce the production\nof inflammatory cytokines\nand to adjust what's\ncalled the inflammatome.\nYou've heard of the genome\nand the proteome, et cetera.\nWell, the inflammatome is the total array\nor at least the near-total array\nof genes and proteins\nthat control inflammation.\nHow can you reduce inflammation\nand make that inflammatome healthier?\nWell, they've shown that\ntwo to four servings\nof fermented foods per day,\nand here, I'm not referring\nto fermented alcohol.\nI'm talking about\nlow-sugar fermented foods,\nso things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,\nfor those of you that like Japanese food.\nThere are others, I\nknow, things like kefir\nor things like yogurts that\nhave a lot of active bacteria,\nagain, low-sugar varieties\nof all these things.\nThose are terrific at\nreducing inflammatory markers\nand at improving the gut microbiome.\nOne could imagine that\neither inoculating oneself\nfrom some of the effects of alcohol,\nalthough I'd prefer that people\njust not drink alcohol\nchronically, frankly,\nor if somebody's trying to\nrepair their gut microbiome\nbecause they ingested a lot of alcohol\nor because they had a lot of\nthese inflammatory cytokines\nfor many years or even\na short period of time,\nregular ingestion of two to four servings\nof these fermented foods\ncan be quite beneficial.\nI want to make it clear,\nthat has not been examined\nspecifically in the context\nof alcohol use disorder,\nbut because a huge component\nof the negative effects\nof alcohol use disorder\nare based in this gut-liver-brain axis\nand disruption of the gut microbiome\nand the inflammatory cytokines,\nit stands to reason that things\nthat are well-established\nto improve inflammation status,\nin other words, reduce inflammation,\nsuch as ingesting two to four servings\nof low-sugar fermented foods per day,\nmakes sense in terms of trying to repair\nor replenish the system.\nOne could also imagine taking\nprobiotics or prebiotics.\nCertainly that would work as well,\nalthough I've sort of\nfavored the discussion\naround fermented foods\nand replenishment of the gut microbiome\nmostly because there are more studies\nthat have examined that in humans\nand because of the direct relationship\nthat's been established between doing that\nand reducing negative markers\nwithin the inflammatome.\nAnd I should mention,\nalong the lines of repair and recovery,\nI put out a question on\nTwitter the other day.\nI said, \"What do you want\nto know about alcohol?\"\nI got more than 1,000 questions\nand I'll take some more of those questions\na little later in the episode.\nBut one of the things I noticed\nis that many of the\nquestions, hundreds, in fact,\nrelated to the question of,\nwell, if I drank a lot\npreviously, am I doomed?\nCan I reverse the negative effects?\nOr, you know, I'm trying to drink less\nand I'm trying to improve\nmy health as I do that.\nWhat should I do?\nWell, certainly focusing a\nbit on the gut microbiome\nought to be useful.\nThe other thing I should mention\nis as people wean themselves off alcohol,\neven if they're not full-blown alcoholics\nor have alcohol use disorder,\nthey should understand that\nthat increase in cortisol\nthat we talked about earlier\nthat leads to lower stress threshold\nand greater feelings\nof anxiety and stress,\nthat's going to be present\nand it's going to take\nsome time to dissipate.\nSo for some people, it might\neven just be helpful to realize\nthat as you try and wean\nyourself off alcohol\nor maybe you even go cold turkey,\nthat increased anxiety\nand feelings of stress\nshould be expected.\nAnd in that case, I would\npoint you to an episode\nthat we did on master stress.\nYou can find that, again,\nat hubermanlab.com.\nIt's got a ton of behavioral, nutritional,\nsupplementation-based, exercise-based,\nI suppose, exercise is\nbehavioral, but a lot of tools.\nYou can navigate to those\neasily 'cause we have timestamps\nso you can go right to\nthe topic of interest.\nThose tools are going to be very useful\nin trying to clamp or control your stress.\nAnd the point here\nis just that some increase\nin stress should be expected,\nand it should be expected\nbecause of that increase in cortisol\nthat occurs with even\nlow-level consumption\nyet chronic alcohol consumption.\nNow I'd like to talk about\na fairly common phenomenon,\nwhich is post-alcohol consumption malaise,\nalso referred to as hangover.\nHangover is a constellation of effects\nranging from headache to nausea\nto what's sometimes called hangxiety,\nwhich is anxiety that\nfollows a day of drinking.\nHangxiety, I think we can\nunderstand physiologically\nif we think about that\nprocess of alcohol intake\nincreasing the amount of cortisol\nand the ratio of cortisol to\nsome other stress hormones.\nThat well explains why some\npeople wake up the day after\nor even the day the day\nafter a night drinking\nand feel anxious and not well\nand stressed for reasons\nthey don't understand.\nSo if you're somebody who\nexperiences hangxiety,\nthen, again, I refer you to\nthe master stress episode\nthat we put out some time ago,\nand you can find that at hubermanlab.com,\ntools to deal with anxiety,\ntools to deal with stress,\nranging, again, from\nbehavioral to nutritional\nand supplement-based, et cetera.\nThat, of course, is not justification\nfor going out and drinking so much\nthat you get hangxiety-induced hangover,\nbut for those of you that are experiencing\npost-alcohol consumption\nhangxiety, as it were,\nthat could be a useful resource\nbecause I certainly don't want anyone\nexperiencing uncomfortable\namounts of anxiety,\nand there are great tools\nand resources for that.\nNow, the other aspects of hangover,\nsuch as the stomachache or headache\nor feelings of malaise or fogginess,\nthose could be related to a\nnumber of different things\nand probably are related to\na number of different things.\nFirst of all, the sleep that\none gets after even just one,\nyes, even just one glass of wine or a beer\nis not the same sleep that you get\nwhen you don't have alcohol\ncirculating in your system.\nAnd not trying to be a downer here,\nbut this was discussed in the\nHuberman Lab Podcast episode\nwhere I had Dr. Matthew\nWalker from UC Berkeley on.\nAnd, of course, Dr. Walker\nis a world expert in sleep,\nruns one of the preeminent laboratories\nstudying sleep and its effects,\nwrote the incredible book,\n\"Why We Sleep,\" and so on.\nDr. Walker told me, and\nit certainly is supported\nby lots and lots of quality\npeer-reviewed studies\nin animals and in humans,\nthat when alcohol is present\nin the brain and bloodstream\nthat the architecture\nof sleep is disrupted.\nSlow-wave sleep, deep sleep,\nand rapid eye movement sleep,\nall of which are essential\nfor getting a restorative\nnight's sleep, are all disrupted.\nSo for those of you\nthat are drinking a glass or two of wine\nor having a hard liquor drink or a beer\nin order to fall asleep,\nthe sleep you're getting is\nsimply not high-quality sleep,\nor certainly not as high-quality\nas the sleep you'd be getting\nif you did not have\nalcohol in your system,\nOf course, when we're\ntalking about hangover,\nwe're talking generally\nabout the consumption\nof more than just one or two drinks.\nOf course, for some\npeople, one or two drinks\nis probably sufficient to induce hangover,\nbut for most people it's going\nto be having three or four,\nexceeding their typical\nlimit, as it's called.\nAgain, not the legal limit,\nthat's a whole other business.\nBut when one ingests too\nmuch alcohol for them,\none of the reasons they\nfeel terrible the next day\nis because their sleep\nisn't really good sleep.\nIn fact, it's not even sleep.\nIt's often considered pseudosleep,\nor at least that's what it's called\nin the sleep science field,\nbecause people are in kind of a low-level,\nhypnotic kind of trance,\nit's not real sleep,\nthere are multiple bouts of waking up,\nthey may not even realize\nthey're waking up multiple times.\nOkay, so there's the\nsleep-induced effects.\nThen there are the disrupted\ngut microbiome effects,\nsome of which we talked about earlier\nso now you understand the mechanism\nof alcohol destroying good,\nhealthy gut microbiota,\nwhich then leads to leaky\ngut and things of that sort.\nBut one could imagine,\nagain, could imagine,\nand there is some evidence\nstarting to support this,\nthat, again, ingesting\nlow-sugar fermented foods\nor maybe even prebiotic or probiotics\nto support the gut microbiome\nmight assist in some of\nthe gut-related malaise\nassociated with hangover.\nIn other words, get those\ngut microbiota healthy again\nas quickly as possible,\nor maybe even before you drink,\nhave those gut microbiota healthy.\nI would hope that you'd do that.\nI think everybody should\nbe doing something\nto support their gut microbiome,\nwhether or not it's the ingestion\nof low-sugar fermented foods daily\nor at least on a regular basis\nor ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.\nThe gut microbiome is so important\nfor so many different things.\nIn terms of hangover and headache,\nwe know that that's caused\nby vasoconstriction,\nthe constriction of blood\nvessels that tends to occur\nas a rebound after a night of drinking.\nAlcohol can act as a vasodilator,\nit can dilate the blood vessels.\nPart of that is associated\nwith the increase\nin so-called parasympathetic tone.\nWe have an autonomic nervous system\nand it's got a sympathetic component.\nThese are neurons that make us more alert,\nand if they're very active,\nthey make us very stressed.\nThere's also the parasympathetic aspect\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nThis is all just fancy geek speak\nfor the parts of your brain and body,\nthe nerve cells that\nmake you very relaxed.\nWhen you're very relaxed,\nthere tends to be vasodilation.\nIt allows for more movement of blood\nand other things through the bloodstream,\nand alcohol tends to\ninduce some vasodilation,\nat least in some of the capillary beds.\nAnd then when the alcohol wears off,\nthere's vasoconstriction and\npeople get brutal headaches.\nThat's why some people will\ntake aspirin or Tylenol\nor Advil or things like that,\nthe sort of non-steroid\nanti-inflammatories.\nI should mention, there is a\nlot of literature coming out\nthat some of these non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs\nare not good for us for a\nnumber of different reasons,\nthe way they impact the liver,\nthe way they impact the immune system,\nand, no surprise, the way they\nimpact the gut microbiome.\nSo I'm not one to tell\nyou what medications\nto take or not take,\nbut you certainly would want\nto do a quick web search\nof effects of non-steroid\nanti-inflammatories\nand aspirin before you start taking those,\nor stop taking those, for that matter.\nGenerally, they will alleviate headache,\nbut they can often have other issues,\nincluding liver issues.\nAnd keep in mind, the\nnight after drinking,\nyour liver has already taken a beating\nbecause of the need of the liver\nto convert alcohol from\nacetaldehyde into acetate,\nwhich is now a pathway\nthat you well understand.\nSo I'm not certain\nand, in fact, I believe\nit's not the greatest idea\nto burden your liver further\nthrough the use of things\nthat are going to cause it\nto have to work harder\nand metabolize things\nif the goal is simply\nto alleviate a headache.\nThere's a lot of kind of lore,\nold school lore about how\nto relieve a hangover.\nWe already talked about how\neating food won't do that\nbut eating food will\nprevent the rapid absorption\nof even more alcohol into the bloodstream.\nThere's the lore that one should\nsimply ingest more alcohol.\nWhat terrible advice that is.\nThat's just going to delay\nan even worse hangover.\nHowever, I'd be remiss if I\ndidn't say that the reason\nthat that myth came to be,\nor that, I should say,\nthat truth came to be,\nbecause indeed ingesting more alcohol\nwill alleviate a hangover\nbut then a worse hangover will show up,\nthe reason that came to be\nis because ingestion of more alcohol\nwill cause those constricted vessels\nthat are giving the\nheadache to dilate again.\nBut, of course, ingesting more\nalcohol to relieve a hangover\nis simply a bad idea.\nJust don't do it.\nI think this is called the\nhair of the dog approach.\nMaybe someone can put in the\nshow note captions on YouTube\nwhy it's called the hair of the dog.\nI can come up with a few ideas\nbut they're not going\nto be very good ones,\nand some of them would probably\neven be outright ridiculous.\nSo do not ingest more alcohol\nsimply to try and recover from a hangover.\nI know many people have\ntried that one before\nbut that's a terrible idea.\nNow, one thing that\nyou'll also hear out there\nis that deliberate cold exposure,\nfor instance, taking a cold\nshower, might relieve hangover.\nI find this one particularly interesting\nbecause we've done\nepisodes on the benefits\nof deliberate cold exposure.\nWe have an entire episode about that.\nYou can find it, again, hubermanlab.com.\nThere are direct links\nto some of the tools\nrelated to deliberate cold exposure\nand we have an entire newsletter\non deliberate cold exposure protocols\nthat you can find on hubermanlab.com,\ngo to our Neural Network newsletter.\nSo those of you that are\ninterested in ice baths\nand cold showers and\nways to leverage those,\nyou can find that there.\nWhat you won't find there is a description\nof how to use deliberate cold exposure\nfor sake of treating hangover.\nBut here, I went into the literature\nand I found something kind of interesting.\nThere is some evidence\nthat increasing levels of\nepinephrine in the bloodstream\ncan actually help with alcohol clearance.\nThat was very surprising to me,\nand I want to point out\nthis is not a large and robust literature,\nbut there's some evidence\npointing to the fact\nthat when levels of\nepinephrine, adrenaline,\nare raised in the brain and bloodstream,\nthat some of the components\nof alcohol metabolism\ncan be accelerated\nand some of the inebriating\neffects of alcohol\ncan be reduced,\nso maybe this old school\nlore of taking a cold shower\nactually has something to it.\nSo in thinking about the use\nof deliberate cold exposure\nin order to reduce the effects of hangover\nor to more rapidly clear alcohol\nfrom the brain and bloodstream,\nI want to be very clear and I\nwant to emphasize your safety.\nThe way to do that is to understand\nthat alcohol lowers core\nbody temperature, okay?\nIt can make people slightly hypothermic.\nIt's going to drop core body temperature.\nSo if you were inebriated\nand you went and got into\na body of water, right,\na pool or a lake or something,\nfirst of all, that's extremely dangerous\nto do while you're inebriated, right?\nPeople drown all the time.\nPeople drown, they die as a\nconsequence of doing that,\nso please don't do that.\nBut also, if it's very cold water,\nyour core body temperature is\ngoing to drop even further.\nNow, if you've heard the\nepisodes that I've done\non deliberate cold exposure previously,\nI've talked about how normally,\nwhen people are not ingesting alcohol,\nthey get into an ice bath or a cold shower\nand their body temperature initially dips\nbut then it rebounds and increases.\nThat's a process that's going to occur\nwhen people do not have\nalcohol in their system.\nWhen you have alcohol in your system,\none of the reasons that\nyou become hypothermic\nis because there's a disruption\nin those hypothalamic brain areas,\nin particular, the brain area\ncalled the medial preoptic area\nthat regulates core body temperature.\nSo it's not so much that\nalcohol makes you cold,\nit's that alcohol disrupts\nthe central command centers\nof the brain that control\ntemperature regulation,\nand that leads you to\nbe slightly hypothermic.\nSo if you then go get\ninto a very cold lake\nor you get into even a\ncold shower or an ice bath,\nthere's the possibility\nof you going very, very\nfar down the ladder\ninto very hypothermic territory\nand that can be very dangerous.\nNow, in terms of dealing with hangover\nwhen the alcohol has been\nlargely cleared from your system,\nwell, that's where some of this old lore\ncombines with some of the modern science\nand says, well, if you\ncan spike adrenaline,\nand certainly getting into an ice bath\nor getting into a cold shower\nor any kind of cold body of water,\nprovided you can do that safely,\nthat will sharply increase your adrenaline\nand, I should say, your dopamine.\nThat's been shown\nand we've talked about\nthis on the podcast before.\nYou get these long, extended increases,\nseveral hours of increases in dopamine\nfrom deliberate cold exposure.\nIt's well-documented\nin humans, by the way.\nSo one could imagine using\ndeliberate cold exposure\nas a way to accelerate the\nrecovery from hangover.\nProvided that's done safely,\nI think there's no reason\nto not explore that,\nand if you wonder what safely is\nand what temperatures to use,\nplease check out the episode\non deliberate cold exposure.\nCold showers, therefore,\nmight actually be one way\nto at least partially relieve hangover.\nCertainly the science from\nvarious places in the literature\nconverged to say that.\nBut, again, be careful, please,\nplease, please be careful\nnot to get into cold water\nwhen you are inebriated.\nIt's absolutely dangerous\nfor all the obvious reasons,\nand it's dangerous also\nfor the nonobvious reasons,\nnot the least of which\nis the dramatic decreases\nin core body temperature\nthat can make you dangerously hypothermic.\nNow, how would you go about\nusing deliberate cold exposure\nto accelerate recovery from hangover?\nWell, there, I would look to\nthe kind of standard protocols\nof, you know, one to three minutes\nor maybe even six minutes\nif you can tolerate it,\nor if you're really cold-adapted,\nmaybe you do seven or ten\nminutes in a cold shower,\nalthough that could be a lot.\nMost people are going to\nexperience a sharp increase\nin epinephrine, in adrenaline,\nand a long-lasting increase in dopamine\nfrom one to three minutes\nof deliberate cold exposure,\nideally done immersion up to the neck,\nagain, do this safely,\nplease, please, please,\nor a cold shower where you're\ngetting under the shower\nas much as possible.\nHow cold? Well, that's going\nto vary person to person.\nI suggest making it as\ncold as is uncomfortable\nsuch that you really want to get out\nbut that you know you can stay in safely\nwithout, for instance, giving\nyourself a heart attack,\nbecause if the water\nis really, really cold,\nof course you can give\nyourself a heart attack.\nMost showers won't go that cold,\nalthough probably some will.\nAgain, please use caution.\nSpike your adrenaline, spike your dopamine\nwith deliberate cold exposure safely.\nOther components of hangover\nthat could be good targets\nfor trying to alleviate hangover,\nand, here, I hope you\nare getting the picture\nbecause it is accurate\nto say that hangover\nis a multifaceted phenomenon.\nIt's not like one\nmolecule and one receptor.\nIt's a bunch of things\nhappening in the brain and body.\nBut is the dehydration\nassociated with alcohol?\nAlcohol is a diuretic.\nFor multiple reasons, it causes people\nto excrete not only water but also sodium.\nSodium is an electrolyte\ncritical for the function of neurons,\nso making sure that\nyou have enough sodium,\npotassium, and magnesium,\nso-called electrolytes,\nis going to be important\nfor proper brain function,\nbodily organ function.\nEven for people that have\njust had one or two drinks\nthe night before,\nit's likely that your electrolyte balance\nand your fluid balance\nis going to be disrupted,\nand that's because alcohol also disrupts\nthe so-called vasopressin pathway.\nI talked a lot about vasopressin\nand the way that it interacts with\nand controls different\naspects of water retention\nand water release from the\nbody in the form of urine\nin the episode on salt.\nSo, again, I'm referring\nto hubermanlab.com\nas the site where you\ncan find that episode\non salt balance and ways to\nrestore electrolyte balance.\nHaving your electrolytes\nat the proper levels\nbefore you drink is ideal.\nSome people will say for\nevery glass of alcohol\nthat you drink, you should\ndrink one glass of water.\nI would say better would\nbe two glasses of water\ngiven the dehydrating effects of alcohol,\nand even better would be\nwater with electrolytes.\nThat certainly would set you up\nfor a better day the next day.\nAnd if you don't manage to do that,\n'cause I suppose it's kind of geeky\nwalking around with electrolyte packets\nout at the bar or whatnot,\nalthough, you know, geeky,\nin my book, is a good thing,\nthe next day, you could take\nsome electrolytes upon waking,\nmaybe even some before you go to sleep\nthe night of drinking.\nSo hangover's made worse\nby disturbed sleep,\nmade worse by disrupted gut microbiome,\nmade worse by disrupted electrolytes,\nmade worse by the depletion\nof epinephrine and dopamine.\nThat's why replenishing the\nmicrobiome with fermented foods,\nlow-sugar fermented foods, that is,\nthat's why using safe\ndeliberate cold exposure\nfor spiking adrenaline and\nfor increasing dopamine,\nand that's why consuming electrolytes\nare all going to be beneficial.\nThe folks over at examine.com,\na website that I really like\nbecause it just has so\nmuch useful information,\nhave assembled a list of things\nthat have been proposed,\npurported to improve,\nor, I should say, to remove\nthe effects of hangover,\nand, as they point out\nand I would like to point out over there,\nthere isn't a lot of quality\nscience to support the idea\nthat any one compound\ncan eliminate hangover.\nAnd that's probably because hangover,\nagain, arises from multiple\norgans and tissues and systems\nin both the brain and body.\nNonetheless, they have a terrific\nlist over there of things,\neverything from Japanese pear fruit juice\nhas been proposed to do this,\nto some other really esoteric things,\neven things like yohimbine.\nFrankly, when I look at the\nliterature there and elsewhere,\none simply cannot find\nthe magic substance,\nthe one herb, the one potion\nthat can wipe away hangover.\nGetting rid of hangover\nis going to be best solved\nby doing a collection\nof a small number of very powerful things,\nof which I've already listed off a few.\nHowever, there are some additional things\nthat one can do for relieving hangover,\nand one of them is to be very thoughtful\nabout what sorts of alcohol one consumes.\nSo I find this interesting.\nThere have actually been studies\nof which types of alcohol lead\nto the greatest hangovers.\nThere's actually a lot of legend and lore\nabout this as well.\nSome people have said, for instance,\nthat drinks that have a high sugar content\nlead to greater hangovers.\nTurns out that's not the case,\nor at least that's not\nwhat the science points to.\nIf you look at the\nexpected hangover severity,\nwhat you find is that at\nthe bottom end of the scale,\nthere's a drink that I'm not\ngoing to tell you, for the moment,\nbut what you find is that near\nit is, for instance, beer.\nThe consumption of beer,\nprovided it is not overconsumption, right,\nit's not far beyond the\ntolerance of the individual,\nso it's one or two beers,\nis less likely to cause a\nhangover than, say, whiskey.\nAnd a glass of whiskey,\nor, you know, not as much\nwhiskey as beer, of course,\nbut a glass of whiskey, for instance,\nis more likely to cause hangover\nthan gin, as it turns out.\nAgain, this is what's\nfallen out of the data.\nAnd yet a glass of rum or red wine\nis more likely to cause a hangover\nthan any of the other things\nI've mentioned so far.\nAt the top, top, top of the list\nof drinks that induce hangover is brandy.\nAnd one could then say,\n\"Well, doesn't brandy have a lot of sugar?\nMaybe it's the sugar\nthat's causing hangovers.\"\nAnd this is something that's been,\nagain, discussed over and\nover, that people say,\n\"Oh, it's the high-sugar\ndrinks that cause hangover.\"\nIt turns out, however,\nthat when one looks at alcoholic drinks\nand sugar content and hangover,\nat the very bottom of the list is,\ngosh, this makes me cringe\njust to think about,\nis ethanol diluted in orange juice.\nUgh, I can't believe\npeople actually drink this,\nbut ethanol diluted in orange juice.\nSo this is not vodka\nand orange juice, okay?\nVodka was third on the\nlist from the bottom\nof drinks that induce hangover.\nAgain, this is within amounts\nthat are comfortable\nfor the person to drink,\nthat they have enough experience with\nor that they have the\nbody weight to tolerate\nwithout getting very, very drunk.\nSo the point is that if it were sugar\nthat's causing hangover,\nwell, then the ethanol\ndiluted in orange juice\nwould probably be at the top of the list\nin terms of inducing hangover.\nBut it's not, it's at\nthe bottom of the list,\nand brandy is at the top of the list.\nSo what you find is that what scales\nfrom ethanol diluted in orange juice\nto beer to vodka to gin,\nhere, I'm ascending the hierarchy\nof things that cause hangover,\ngin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine,\nand then brandy at the peak,\nit's sort of the world\nheavyweight champion\nof hangover-inducing drinks,\nwell, what's increasing are\ncongeners within those drinks.\nCongeners are things like\nnitrites and other substances\nthat give alcohol it's distinctive flavor\nand that also lead\nto some of the inebriating\neffects of alcohol.\nNow, then you ask,\n\"Okay, well, what is it that\nthese congeners are doing?\nAnd what are these nitrites doing?\"\nAnd guess what?\nWhile they do have effects on the brain\nand on other tissues,\ntheir main effects are to\ndisrupt the gut microbiome.\nSo what this points to again\nis that having a healthy gut microbiome\nand perhaps ensuring that you\nbolster your gut microbiome\nthe day after drinking\nis going to be especially\nimportant for warding off hangover\nor at least reducing\nthe effects of hangover\nor the symptoms of hangover or both.\nI would love to see a study on this.\nI could imagine designing\nthe study myself,\nalthough this isn't\nreally the sorts of things\nmy laboratory does,\nbut can imagine some people\ngetting probiotic and prebiotic,\nsome regularly, some just after drinking,\nor low-sugar fermented foods,\nand see what the effects are\nin terms of subjective effects of hangover\nbut also some physiological measures.\nI think the way to think\nabout hangover overall\nis that, again, it\nrepresents a multifaceted,\nmulti-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon,\nand the best way to deal with it\nis as a multi-cell, multi-tissue,\nmulti-chemical phenomenon.\nAnd before I listed off some of the things\nthat one could do in\norder to adjust hangover,\nagain, the one that comes\nout at the top of that list,\nI believe, at least based\non my read of the data,\nis to support the gut microbiome\nand certainly not to ingest more alcohol.\nAnd I suppose if we were\nto get really honest\nwith one another\nand ask what's the best\nway to avoid a hangover,\nit would be to not drink\nin the first place.\nSo we've covered the\nmajor effects of alcohol\nthat lead to this state\nthat we call drunkenness or inebriation.\nAgain, there's a range there.\nYou can be tipsy, people\ncan be blackout drunk,\npeople can be passed out drunk.\nWe've also talked about hangover\nand the fact that it's a\nmultifaceted phenomenon\nand recovery from hangover\ninvolves a multifaceted approach.\nNext I want to talk about tolerance.\nTolerance to alcohol is a\nvery interesting phenomenon.\nIt has roots mainly in the\nbrain and in brain systems.\nThere's not time in the world,\nlet alone within this podcast,\nto get into all the aspects of tolerance.\nThere are more than 10\ndifferent types of tolerance.\nThere's functional\ntolerance, chronic tolerance,\nrapid tolerance, there's\nmetabolic tolerance,\nthere's psychological tolerance.\nLet's keep it simple for\nsake of today's discussion.\nAnd for those of you that are interested\nin learning about all the\ndifferent types of tolerance\nand aspects of tolerance,\nthere's an excellent review,\nwe will provide a link to this.\nThis was published in 2021,\nso it's pretty recent,\nin the journal \"Pharmacology\nBiochemistry and Behavior.\"\nIncidentally, or not so incidentally,\nthat was the first journal\nI ever published in\nso I have a particular\naffection for that journal.\nNonetheless, it is called\nTolerance to alcohol:\nA critical yet understudied\nfactor in alcohol addiction.\nAnd while this paper\ndoes include alcohol\naddiction in the title,\nit's not just about alcohol addiction.\nHere's the basic summary\nof what tolerance is.\nFirst of all, tolerance\nrefers to the reduced effects\nof alcohol with repeated exposure,\nand it is caused mainly by changes\nin neurotransmitter systems in the brain\nthat are the direct consequence\nof the toxicity of alcohol,\nthat aldehyde molecule that\nwe talked about before.\nThere's an enormous number\nof chemicals that change\nwith repeated exposure to acetaldehyde,\neverything from GABA to\ndopamine to serotonin,\nsecond messenger systems,\nadenosine, and on and on.\nRather than go into\neach of those in detail,\nI just want to talk about the\ncontour of the reinforcing\nand the tolerance-inducing\neffects of alcohol.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, here we are back to our old friend,\nmeaning the molecule that\ncomes up over and over again\nin these podcast episodes,\nwhich is dopamine.\nWhether or not somebody\nhas a predisposition to alcoholism or not,\nwhether or not they're\nexperienced drinker or not,\nwhen people initially start drinking,\nthere are increases in dopamine,\nor what we call dopaminergic transmission.\nDopamine is involved in\nmotivation, in craving,\nit creates a sense of\nwell-being, it increases energy,\nagain, typically only at the\nbeginning of alcohol exposure.\nThat occurs in most people as\na sharp spike, as a increase.\nAgain, if somebody does not\nhave alcohol dehydrogenase\nor has very low levels of the enzyme\nthat convert that\nacetaldehyde into acetate\nand that metabolize\nalcohol, in other words,\nthey will feel sick and lousy in a way\nthat will override any recognition\nof the dopamine release.\nThey're going to be the people\nthat are listening to this\nand just thinking, \"Alcohol\njust makes me feel sick.\nI don't like it.\"\nOkay, that's a specific\nsubcategory of people,\nbut most people experience\nsome sort of mild euphoria.\nThat's why so many people drink, right?\nThe current estimates are\nthat in most countries,\nand certainly in the US, as\nmany as 80% of the adult,\nlegal drinking age\npopulation drinks alcohol,\nand that number could be even higher now\nbecause in the last couple of years,\nthere's been a trend towards\nincreased alcohol consumption,\nespecially in the wake of the pandemic\nand during the pandemic.\nTopic for another time.\nSo there's an increase in dopamine\nand an increase in serotonin,\nso it's kind of an increase in well-being,\nan increase in mood, but it's\na very short-lived increase.\nVery soon after, and actually\ntriggered by that increase,\nis a long and slow reduction\nin dopamine and serotonin\nand related molecules in circuits.\nSo basically what you're\ngetting is a blip of feel good\nfollowed by a long, slow\narc of feeling not so great,\nwhich is why, typically, people will drink\nagain and again across the night.\nThe key thing to\nunderstand about tolerance\nis that with tolerance,\nthe duration of that long, slow reduction\nin dopamine and serotonin\ngets even longer.\nIn other words, the\nnegative effects of alcohol\nthat happen after the\ninitial feeling good,\nextend longer and, in\nfact, get more robust.\nHowever, there's also a reduction\nin the reinforcing properties of alcohol.\nThere's a shrinking of the feel good blip\nthat happens when one\nfirst ingests alcohol,\nand this has been measured\nin animals and humans.\nSo the first drink that somebody has,\nprovided they have enough\nalcohol dehydrogenase\nso that doesn't make them feel\nnauseous and sick right away,\nthey feel really good.\nAnd then as it wears off,\nthey feel kind of lousy\nand they want to drink more\nso they might drink more.\nWith each subsequent drink,\nand even drinks on different\nnights or even different weeks,\nthe amount of dopamine\nthat's released is reduced,\nthe amount of serotonin\nthat's released is reduced.\nSo what you're getting is less and less\nof the reinforcing properties of alcohol,\nthe feel good stuff,\nand more and more\nof the punishment pain\nsignal aspects of alcohol.\nThis is the contour of\nchemical release in the brain\nthat was referred to by my colleague,\nthe incredible Dr. Anna\nLembke, who's a medical doctor.\nShe wrote the incredible\nbook \"Dopamine Nation.\"\nShe was a guest on this\npodcast, on Joe Rogan's podcast,\non Rich Roll's podcast and\nseveral other podcasts.\nWorld expert in addiction,\nand she talked about this\npleasure-pain balance\nthat extends beyond alcohol\nto things like sex and\ngambling and to other behaviors\nthat can potentially become addictive\nbut certainly includes alcohol.\nSo tolerance, it seems, is\na process in which people\nare ingesting more and more alcohol\nas an attempt to get that\nfeeling of well-being back,\nbut what they're really\ngetting is an extended period\nof punishment, of pain, and\nof malaise from the alcohol.\nNow, you might say,\n\"Well, how does that relate to tolerance?\"\nWell, it turns out what\nthey do behaviorally,\nand when I say they,\nI mean animals do this and humans do this,\nis they start drinking more and more\nin an attempt to activate those dopamine\nand serotonin neurons and receptors,\nand as they do that,\nthere is an increase in\nalcohol dehydrogenase,\nso the enzyme that metabolizes\nalcohol is increased\nbecause the body and liver\nhave to contend with all that alcohol,\nso now you've got,\nagain, the two-hit model.\nYou're getting less of\nthe feel good chemicals,\nmore of the negative chemical release,\nor pattern of subjective\nfeeling, I should say,\nand you're metabolizing alcohol\nmore quickly and more readily,\nbut it's not taking you to a better place\nin terms of how you feel.\nThat's one of the major underlying reasons\nfor what we call tolerance.\nSo if you're somebody who drinks\nand you notice that the feeling\nthat you are seeking with alcohol\nis now requiring an additional\ndrink, or drinks plural,\nchances are you are\ndisrupting the dopamine\nand serotonergic systems of your brain,\nand you are doing that in a way\nthat is increasing the\npain and punishment signals\nthat follow alcohol ingestion.\nAnd again, that's not just on\nthe night that you're drinking\nbut afterwards as well.\nIs that all bad news? Well, pretty much.\nBut the good news is that\nif you abstain from drinking\nfor some period of time,\nthen, of course, these systems reset.\nHow long you need to abstain\nwill depend on how much you were drinking\nand how long you were drinking for.\nCertainly people who\nhave alcohol use disorder\nor who are alcoholics,\ntheir main goal should be\nto quit alcohol completely.\nI know there's some debate about this,\nand I don't want to get into that debate\nbecause I'm certainly not going to try\nand direct anyone's recovery.\nThere are expert counselors and MDs\nand people that can work with people.\nIn fact, for some very heavy drinkers\nand people with serious\nalcohol use disorder,\ngoing cold turkey, that is,\nstopping drinking completely,\ncan actually be medically dangerous.\nSo the path to sobriety for certain people\nlooks different than the path\nto sobriety for other people.\nWhat I'm referring to here\nare people that are ingesting,\nagain, somewhere between, on average,\none to two drinks per night,\nwhether or not that's done night to night\nor whether or not that's\ncondensed to weekend use.\nI know a number of\npeople are going to ask,\nperhaps are screaming, \"Is\ndrinking good for me in any way?\"\nFor instance, many people\nhave probably heard\nthat resveratrol is good for people\nand that red wine is rich in resveratrol.\nI hate to break it to you but the reality\nis that if indeed\nresveratrol is good for us,\nand there's some debate about this,\nsome people say strongly yes,\nsome people say no,\nother people say maybe,\nthe amount of red wine that\none would have to drink\nin order to get enough resveratrol\nin order for it to be health promoting\nis so outrageously high\nthat it would surely induce\nother negative effects\nthat would offset the positive\neffects of resveratrol.\nSo I wish I could tell you different.\nAgain, I'm not here to be\nthe bearer of bad news,\nbut the statement I just made\nwas confirmed by Dr. David Sinclair\nwhen he was a guest on this podcast.\nIt's confirmed by other researchers\nwho work on resveratrol\nand related pathways.\nI wish I could tell you\nthat red wine is good for your health,\nand indeed it might be\nthrough some other mechanisms.\nSo, for instance, there have been studies\nof low to moderate red wine consumption.\nThis would be anywhere from\none to four glasses per week.\nAnd I don't mean enormous glasses,\nI mean six-ounce glasses of red wine.\nAnd in those cases, some\nof the stress reduction\nthat can be induced by\nconsumption of red wine,\nmaybe some of the other micronutrients\nand components within red wines,\nin particular red wines that\ncome from particular grapes,\nand this gets really nuanced\nand, frankly, is not well worked out\nin the peer-reviewed literature\nor certainly not clinical trials,\nat least not that I'm aware of.\nTell me if you're aware of a\ngreat clinical trial on this.\nWell, there may be some positive effects\nof that very low level of consumption.\nI'm not trying to take\naway anybody's red wine.\nI'm not trying to take\naway anybody's anything.\nI would be remiss, however,\nif I didn't tell you\nthat resveratrol as the\nargument for drinking,\nand drinking red wine in particular,\nis just not a good one.\nIt's just not supported by\nthe peer-reviewed research.\nA few other things about\nalcohol and health.\nAt the beginning of the\nepisode, I referenced a study\nshowing that indeed not just\nheavy alcohol consumption\nof 12 to 24 or more drinks per week,\nbut also light to moderate\nalcohol consumption of any type,\nwine, beer, spirits, et cetera,\ndoes reduce the thickness of the brain.\nIt really does reduce cortical thickness.\nIn fact, it actually scales\nwith the amount of\nalcohol that people drink,\nand this has been well-documented\nin a number of different studies.\nI can provide a link to several of these.\nOne of the more striking\nones actually shows\nthat there's almost a\ndose-dependent increase\nin shrinkage of gray matter volume\nand in these white matter tracts,\nthese axons, these wires, as it were,\nthat connect different neurons\nas a function of how much\nalcohol people drink.\nAnd that's also what's been\nseen in this recent study\nthat I referenced at the beginning\nand that's in the show note captions.\nSo, again, probably the best\namount of alcohol to drink\nwould be zero glasses per\nweek or ounces per week.\nFor those of you drinking\nlow amounts of alcohol,\nmake sure you're doing other\nthings to promote your health.\nAnd for those of you that\nare drinking moderate\nand certainly for those of\nyou that are heavy drinkers,\nplease do everything you\ncan to move away from that\nand to quit entirely.\nBut even for the moderate\nconsumers of alcohol,\nyou are going to want to be aware\nof some of the negative health effects\nand do things to offset those\nif indeed you're not\ngoing to stop drinking\nor reduce your intake.\nOne of the really bad effects of alcohol,\nbut that's extremely well-documented,\nis the fact that alcohol,\nbecause of this toxicity\nof acetaldehyde and the related pathways,\ncan alter DNA methylation,\nit can alter gene expression.\nThat can mean many things\nin different tissues,\nbut it is associated\nwith a significant\nincrease in cancer risk,\nin particular, breast cancer,\nand in particular, because\nbreast tissue is present\nin both males and females,\nbut in women, it's especially vulnerable\nto some of the DNA methylation changes,\nwell, breast cancer in women\nhas a relationship to alcohol intake,\nand alcohol intake has a relationship\nto breast cancer in women.\nIn fact, there has been proposed\nto be a anywhere from 4 to 13% increase\nin risk of breast cancer\nfor every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.\nHow much is 10 grams?\nWell, there, we need to think a little bit\nabout the variation in\nthe amount of alcohol\nand different drinks across the world.\nDifferent countries serve\ndifferent sized drinks\nand have different concentrations\nof alcohol in those drinks.\nSo without going down\ntoo much of a rabbit hole\nand just giving you some good\nrules of thumb to work with,\nthere have been studies of\nthe percentage of alcohol\nincluded in different drinks\nand the sizes of different drinks\nthat are served in different countries,\nand here's kind of a\npatchwork of those findings.\nIn Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,\nor one shot of liquor,\nas it's served there,\ntends to include anywhere\nfrom seven to eight grams of alcohol.\nIn the US, one beer, which\ngenerally is 12 ounces\nif it's in a bottle,\none glass of wine or a shot of liquor\ntends to include about 10\nto 12 grams of alcohol.\nAnd in Russia, one drink\nof the various sorts that I just described\ntypically will have as\nmuch as 24 grams of alcohol\nbecause of the differences in\nthe concentration of alcohols\nand the sizes of drinks that are poured\nin these different countries, okay?\nOf course, there are other\ncountries in the world,\nthose countries are\nalso vitally important,\nbut those are the ones that\nI extracted from the studies\nthat I could find.\nWhat does this mean?\nWell, what we're talking about\nis that for every 10\ngrams of alcohol consumed,\nso that's one beer in the US,\nmaybe a little bit more\nthan one beer in Japan,\nor basically a third of a drink in Russia,\nthere's a 4 to 13%\nincrease in risk of cancer.\nThat's pretty outrageous, right?\nAnd you might think,\n\"Wait, how could it be\nthat, you know, this stuff is even legal?\"\nWell, look, as I described\nbefore, it's a toxin.\nIt's also a toxin that\npeople enjoy the effects of.\nI mean, in the US at least,\nthey tried prohibition.\nIt certainly did lead, yes,\ndid lead to a reduction\nin alcohol-induced health disorders,\nin particular, cirrhosis of the liver.\nIt also led to a lot of crime\nbecause it became a substance\nthat a lot of people still wanted\nand that people were\nwilling to break the law\nin order to provide, or, I\nshould say, to sell and provide.\nBut the point is that the\nmore alcohol people drink,\nthe greater their increase of cancer,\nin particular, breast cancer.\nAnd that's because of the fact\nthat alcohol has these effects on cells\nthat include changes in gene expression,\nand cancer, that is, the growth of tumors,\nis a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?\nA tumor is a aggregation\nor the proliferation,\naggregation is stuff sticking\ntogether, by the way,\nproliferation is stuff duplicating,\na proliferation or aggregation of cells\nthat could be a glioma, glial cells,\nglioma brain tumor, right?\nIt could be lymphoma, so within\nthe lymph tissue, et cetera.\nThe mutations that alcohol\ninduces to cause this\nare wide ranging,\nsome of those are\nstarting to be understood.\nFor those of you that are\ninterested in cell biology,\nI'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,\nagain, this is super specialized\nand for the aficionados only,\nyou don't need to know this,\nthe PD-1 pathway seems\nto be upregulated and,\nand we knew this from\nthe discussion earlier,\nthere's a downregulation\nin some of the anti-inflammatory molecules\nthat help suppress this\nproliferation of cancers.\nNowadays, there's a lot\nof interest in the fact\nthat the immune system is\nconstantly combating cancers\nthat exist in us all the time.\nYou know, little tumors start growing\nand our immune system\ngoes and gobbles them up.\nLittle tumors start growing,\nthe immune system senses inflammation,\nsends out these incredible cells,\nthese killer B-cells and\nT-cells, and beats them up.\nCancers proliferate and take\nhold and cause serious problems\nwhen the proliferation of cells\nexceeds the immune system's ability\nto gobble up and remove those cells.\nThere are other mechanisms\nof regulating cancers,\nbut that's one of the primary one.\nAnd alcohol hits it. Again,\nit's a two hit model.\nIt increases tumor growth\nand it decreases the sorts of molecules\nthat suppress and combat tumor growth.\nSo, again, even low to\nmoderate amounts of alcohol\ncan be problematic for sake of cancers,\nin particular, breast cancers.\nEpidemiologists and health specialists\nlove to try and compare\ndifferent substances\nin terms of how bad they are.\nRarely do they compare substances\nin terms of how good they\nare, but sometimes they do.\nAnd what they'll sometimes tell you\nand what you can find in the literature\nis that ingesting 10 to\n15 grams of alcohol a day,\nso that would be like one beer in the US\nor one glass of wine,\nis the same as smoking\n10 cigarettes a day.\nFrankly, it's hard to make\nthat direct relationship\nreally stick because,\nyou know, it's a question\nof, you know, how long people inhale,\ndo they have a predisposition\nto a lung cancer, et cetera.\nBut even if that number is off\nby plus or minus two cigarettes,\nor even if that number was the equivalent\nof one glass of wine equals\none cigarette per day...\nI think there's general consensus now\nthat nicotine consumed by\nvaping or by cigarette,\nit's bad for us in terms of lung cancer\nand other forms of cancer.\nAnd for some reason, I don't know why,\nbecause this knowledge\nabout alcohol and cancer\nand these established relationships\nhave been known since the late 1980s.\nThe first, you know,\nlandmark paper on this\nwas published in 1987.\nI can provide a link to that paper.\nIt's actually quite interesting to read.\nWell, the relationship is there\nand yet we don't often\nhear about it, right?\nIn fact, before researching this episode,\nI had heard before that alcohol\ncan increase cancer risk\nbut I wasn't aware of just how\nstrong that relationship is.\nBecause of the serious nature\nof what we're talking about\nand because I would hate to be confusing\nor misleading to anybody,\nI want to just emphasize\nthat this statistic,\nthat there is a 4 to 13%,\ndepending on which study you look at,\na 4 to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,\nin particular, breast cancer,\nfor every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,\nthat's 10 grams per day, so\nthat's one drink per day.\nBut I do want to emphasize\nthat if that equates to\nseven drinks per week\nand all those seven drinks\nare being consumed on Friday and Saturday,\nit still averages to 10 grams per day.\nAnd I also want to emphasize\nthat there are things\nthat people can do to at\nleast partially offset\nsome of the negative effects of alcohol\nas it relates to\npredisposition to the formation\nof certain kinds of tumors and cancers.\nI also want to be clear before I say it\nthat doing the things\nI'm about to tell you\nis not a guarantee that you're\nnot going to get cancer,\nnor is it a guarantee that\nalcohol is not going to lead\nto an increased predisposition\nfor certain kinds of cancers,\nand the two things are\nconsumption of folate\nand other B vitamins, especially B12.\nYou know, the consumption\nof folate and B12\nhas been shown to decrease cancer risk\nin people that ingest alcohol,\nbut not completely offset it.\nWhy that is isn't exactly clear.\nIt probably has something\nto do with the relationship\nbetween folate and B12\nand other B vitamins\nin gene regulation pathways\nthat can lead to tumor growth.\nAt some point soon, we will get\nan expert in cancer biology,\nand, in particular, in breast\ncancer biology, on the program\nand we can ask them about this.\nBut I realize this is going\nto raise a number of questions\nand maybe even cause some\nof you to go out there\nand start taking folate and\nother B vitamins and B12.\nNot incidentally, a lot of the\nreported hangover supplements\nand treatments include folate and B12.\nI don't know if they had the\ncancer literature in mind\nwhen they created those\nsupplements and products.\nI doubt they did.\nAlcohol really does\ndisrupt B vitamin pathways,\nboth synthesis pathways\nand utilization pathways,\nso sometimes you'll hear,\n\"Oh, you know, if you get your B vitamins,\nit helps you recover from\nhangover more quickly.\"\nAgain, the literature\ndoesn't support that,\nbut also again, there\naren't a lot of studies.\nBut more to the point\nas it relates to alcohol\nand the formation of tumors and cancers,\nit does appear that decreased folate\nand other B vitamins like\nB12 are partially responsible\nfor the effect of alcohol\nin increasing cancer risk.\nAnd it does appear that\nconsuming adequate amounts\nof folate in B12 might,\nagain, might partially,\nreally want to bold face\nand underline and highlight partially,\noffset some of that increased risk.\nThere's an additional category\nthat I want to highlight, of course,\nand this is vitally important to state\neven though it's obvious,\nwhich is that people who are pregnant\nshould absolutely not consume alcohol.\nFetal alcohol syndrome is well known\nand established, it's terrible.\nFetuses experience\ndiminished brain development\nthat's often permanent,\ndiminished limb development,\ndiminished organ development\nin the periphery,\nmeaning, you know, the heart,\nthe lungs, liver, et cetera.\nIngesting alcohol while\npregnant is simply a bad idea.\nAnd the reason I say this at all\nis, first of all, it's\nimportant to include\nin an episode like this,\nbut also because we\ncan look at two things.\nFirst of all, we can look at mechanism\nand then we can also\nlook at some of the lore\nthat still sadly exists out there.\nLet's take care of the lore\nthat sadly exists first.\nIf you look online,\nyou will sometimes be able to find, sadly,\nthat some people believe\nthat certain kinds of alcohol\nare not detrimental to fetuses.\nThey'll say, \"Well, champagne is safe\nfor a pregnant mother to\ndrink but beer is not.\"\nThat is absolutely categorically\nfalse. Alcohol is alcohol.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever\nthat consuming certain types of alcohol\nis safer for fetuses than others.\nAlcohol is a toxin,\nand the reason fetal\nalcohol syndrome exists\nis because the ability of that toxin\nto disrupt cellular processes.\nRemember tumor growth\nand the way that alcohol\ncan accelerate tumor growth\nby proliferation of cells,\nthe wrong cells, the ones you\ndon't want to proliferate?\nWell, all of embryonic development,\nall of fetal development,\nit's not the growth of a tumor,\nit's obviously the growth of an embryo,\nand it's done in a very orchestrated way.\nI started off studying brain development.\nThat's where I got my\nbeginnings in neurobiology,\nand I still teach embryology\nto medical students and graduate students.\nThe set of coordinated processes\nthat has to take place\nfrom conception to birth\nin order to give rise to a healthy embryo\nis so, so dynamically controlled\nand so exquisitely precise,\nwith checkpoints and recovery mechanisms\nand redundancy in the\ngenes that are expressed\nto make sure that if anything goes wrong,\nit's repaired, et cetera.\nAlcohol as a mutagen, I\nhaven't used that word yet,\nbut a substance that can mutate DNA\nthrough alterations in DNA methylation\nin these checkpoints in the cell cycle,\nalcohol as a mutagen is\none of the worst things\nthat a developing embryo\ncan be exposed to.\nAnd, again, because it's\nwater-soluble and fat-soluble,\ningestion of alcohol\nwhen people are pregnant\npasses right to the fetus.\nNow, I realize that a\nnumber of people out there\nmight be thinking, \"Oh goodness,\nyou know, I didn't realize I was pregnant\nuntil a certain stage of pregnancy,\nand before I realized, I\nwas ingesting alcohol.\"\nObviously, one can't\nundo what's been done,\nbut I want to also emphasize\nthat fetal alcohol syndrome,\nwhile, yes, there's a full-blown syndrome\nthat manifests as changes in\nthe cranial facial development\nthat are very obvious,\nand you can look these up,\nyou've probably seen these before,\nor the pictures before, rather,\nit has to do with eye\nspacing, forehead size,\na number of other features\nof the cranial facial development,\nand of course stuff's\ngoing on in the brain too,\nit's along a continuum.\nSo it is possible that some\nof the changes that occur\nare more minor,\nand, thankfully, the young brain,\nin particular, the early postnatal brain,\nis incredibly plastic.\nThere are things that can be done\nin order to help recover neural circuits\nthat didn't develop well, et cetera.\nBut even though it's somewhat\nobvious, or should be obvious,\nI really want to make clear\nthat there's zero evidence whatsoever\nthat certain forms of alcohol\nare safer for pregnant\nwomen to ingest than others.\nAbsolutely wrong, no one who's pregnant\nshould be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.\nAnd certainly, if people feel\nlike they can't avoid\nalcohol while pregnant,\nthey really need to work with somebody\nto make sure that it just\nabsolutely doesn't happen\nbecause it is so detrimental\nto the developing fetus.\nLastly, I want to talk\nabout the effects of alcohol on hormones,\nand I want to distinguish\nbetween low amounts of alcohol intake,\nhigher amounts of alcohol intake,\nand, again, this chronic alcohol intake\nversus occasional use\nversus really chronic use,\nmeaning alcoholic or\nalcoholic use disorder,\nwhere people are drinking\nan immense amount\non an ongoing basis.\nThe literature on alcohol and\nhormones is quite extensive,\nand there are, of course,\nmany, many different types of hormones.\nThe hormones that most often get mentioned\nand talked about on this podcast\nare the hormones\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nwhich are present in both men and women\nand that, in both men and women,\nare important for things like libido,\nthey're also responsible\nfor sexual development,\nactual development of the genitalia\nbefore birth and after birth,\nthey're responsible, for\ninstance, estrogen is important\nfor memory and cognition.\nYou never want to drop estrogen\ntoo low in men or women\n'cause it can disrupt cognition\nand joint health, et cetera.\nTo keep this discussion\nrelatively constrained,\nit's fair to say that alcohol,\nand, in particular, the\ntoxic metabolites of alcohol,\nincrease the conversion of\ntestosterone to estrogen.\nNow, this occurs in a\nnumber of different tissues.\nThis is not just occurring\nin the testes of males,\nthis is occurring in lots\nof different tissues.\nAnd I'll refer you to a excellent review.\nWe'll provide a link in\nthe show note captions.\nThis is a paper that was\npublished in the year 2000\nbut the data are still quite strong.\nThe journal is called,\nof all things, \"Alcohol,\"\nyes, literally a journal called \"Alcohol\"\nfor the publication of data and reviews\non alcohol and its effects,\nand the title of the paper is\nCan alcohol promote aromatization\nof androgens to estrogens?\nAromatization is this\nprocess of the conversion\nof testosterone and other\nandrogens to estrogens\nthrough things like aromatase enzyme.\nAnd this is a beautiful review\nthat describes every tissue,\nor near every tissue,\nfrom the ovary in females to the placenta\nto the liver to the testes,\nin which alcohol can\nincrease the aromatization\nof testosterone to estrogen.\nNow, in females, this\nmay be part of the reason\nwhy there's an increase in\nestrogen-related cancers.\nBreast cancer can be\neither estrogen-related\nor non-estrogen-related,\nthere are other types of\nestrogen-related cancers\noutside of breast cancer,\nbut it appears that one reason why alcohol\nincreases the risk of breast cancer\nis because of this aromatization from,\nof testosterone, excuse me, to estrogen.\nIn males, accelerated\nor abnormal conversion\nof testosterone to estrogen\ncan actually lead to growth\nof the breast tissue in males,\nso-called gynecomastia, or\nother effects of high estrogen,\nor I should say of altered\ntestosterone-estrogen ratios,\n'cause that's really what's important.\nAnd these can include things\nlike diminished sex drive,\nincreased fat storage, and\na number of other things\nthat I think most people would\nfind to be negative effects.\nI once talked about the\nfact that drinking alcohol\ncan increase the aromatization\nof testosterone to estrogen.\nI posted that online,\nand I didn't get attacked\nbut I did get criticized\nfor the fact that it has been shown,\nyes, has been shown,\nthat small amounts of alcohol ingestion,\nso five grams or so of alcohol ingestion,\nthis would be half a glass of\nwine or half a glass of beer,\nat least in some studies showed\nincreases in testosterone,\nwhich was kind of surprising.\nBut I should point out,\nother studies have shown\nthat alcohol ingestion\ncauses decreases in\ntestosterone over time.\nSo there's always this issue\nof whether or not you're\nlooking at a study\nof acute exposure versus chronic exposure,\nyou know, one dose versus\nmultiple doses and exposure.\nI think it's fair to say,\nbased on my read of the literature,\nthis review and other reviews\nthat focus more particularly on humans,\nthat regular ingestion of alcohol\nis going to increase estrogen levels\nwhether or not you're male or female,\nand it's largely doing that\nthrough the aromatization process,\nby increasing the aromatase enzyme.\nYes, there's some dose dependence,\nbut I think if you're\nsomebody who's trying\nto optimize your\ntestosterone-to-estrogen ratio,\nregardless of whether or\nnot you're male or female,\nwell then most certainly\nyou're going to want to avoid\ndrinking too much alcohol.\nSo we've covered a lot of topics\nand data related to the\nmechanisms of alcohol,\nhangover, tolerance,\ncancer risk, et cetera.\nI acknowledge that I've\nmainly talked to you\nabout the negative effects of alcohol.\nI want to acknowledge that\nmany people enjoy alcohol\nin moderation or even light drinking,\nthe occasional drink or\nthe occasional two drinks\nor maybe even, on average,\none drink per night,\nso seven drinks per week.\nI'm certainly not here\nto tell you what to do\nand what not to do.\nI do find it immensely\ninteresting, however,\nthat, first of all,\nalcohol is a known toxin\nto the cells of the body.\nSome of you might immediately say,\n\"Well, wait, what about hormesis?\nWhat about this phenomenon\nwhere if we regularly ingest a\ntoxin, it makes us stronger?\"\nIn other words, what doesn't\nkill us makes us stronger.\nYeah, there's, you know,\nsome reason to believe\nthat might be beneficial\nin terms of some forms of\ncellular resilience maybe, maybe.\nNo, sorry. It doesn't work that way.\nThere are processes of hormesis\nin which, for instance,\nexposing yourself safely\nthrough increases in adrenaline\nthrough, you know, ice baths\nor other things that increase adrenaline\ncan raise your so-called stress threshold,\nbut here, we're talking\nabout cellular stress\nand damage to cells.\nSo my read of the literature,\nand, again, this is my read\nand I invite others to,\nyou know, provide studies\nor I would prefer actually\ncollections of studies\nthat point in the\ndirection, if they exist,\nthat alcohol can be beneficial,\nbut my read of the literature,\nor I should say my understanding\nof what I would call the center of mass\nof the literature on alcohol\nis that no consumption, zero consumption,\nconsumption of zero ounces of alcohol\nis going to be better for your health\nthan low to moderate\nconsumption of alcohol,\nand that low to moderate\nconsumption of alcohol\nis going to be better for you, of course,\nthan moderately high to\nhigh alcohol consumption\non the order of 12 to 24\nor more drinks per week.\nI realize that for most\npeople listening to this,\nit's probably low to\nmoderate alcohol consumption\nthat is part of their standard repertoire,\nand I'm not here to give you\njustification for doing that\nnor am I going to tell you not to do that.\nI would like you to\nconsider perhaps, however,\nthe negative effects that we understand\nand that are documented.\nFor instance, the negative effects\nof alcohol on the gut microbiome\nand the things that you can do\nto better support your gut microbiome,\nthe negative effects on the stress system,\nthat HPA axis that we\ntalked about earlier,\nand the fact that even\nlow to moderate levels\nof alcohol consumption\ncan increase our levels of\nstress when we're not drinking,\nand to think about acquiring some tools\nand, you know, getting some\nproficiency with tools,\nbehavioral or otherwise,\nthat can help you with stress modulation\nthat don't involve alcohol consumption.\nAgain, the point here is to illustrate\nwhere the problems lie\nwith alcohol consumption,\nbut, also, what I've tried to do\nis to point you to some resources\nthat can help offset some\nof those negative effects.\nWill they offset all the effects?\nI can't say that for sure,\nbut certainly taking measures\nto offset some of the negative effects\nof any alcohol consumption that\nyou might be having or doing\nis going to be beneficial to you.\nAnd those tools and protocols\nare going to be\nhealth-promoting in any case.\nIf you're
