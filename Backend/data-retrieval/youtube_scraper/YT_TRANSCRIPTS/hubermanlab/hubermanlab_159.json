    "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nRecently, I had the pleasure\nof hosting two live events:\none in Seattle, Washington\nand one in Portland, Oregon,\nboth entitled, \"The Brain Body Contract,\"\nwhere I discussed science\nand science related tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nMy favorite part of each\nevening, however, was the\nquestion and answer period\nthat followed the lecture.\nI love the question and answer period\nbecause it gives me an opportunity\nto hear directly from the audience\nto what they want to know most,\nand indeed to get into a bit of dialogue\nso we really clarify\nwhat are the underlying\nmechanisms of particular tools,\nhow best to use the tools for\nthings like focus and sleep,\nwe also touched on some things related to\nmental health and physical health.\nIt was a delight for me\nand I like to think that\nthe audience learned a lot.\nI know that many of you weren't\nable to attend those events,\nbut we wanted to make the\ninformation available to you.\nSo what follows this\nis a recording of the\nquestion and answer period,\nfrom the lecture in Seattle, Washington.\nI hope you'll find it\nto be both interesting and informative.\nI'd also like to thank our\nsponsors of these live events.\nThe first is Momentous supplements,\nwhich is our partner with\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nproviding supplements that\nare the very highest quality,\nthat ship international,\nand that are arranged\nin dosages and single\ningredient formulations\nthat make it possible for you\nto develop the optimal\nsupplement strategy for you.\nAnd I'd also like to\nthank our other sponsor,\nwhich is InsideTracker,\nwhich provides blood tests and DNA tests\nso you can monitor\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health progress.\nI'd also like to announce\nthat there are two, new\nlive events scheduled.\nThe first one is going\nto take place Sunday,\nOctober 16th at The Wiltern\ntheater in Los Angeles.\nThe other live event will\ntake place Wednesday,\nNovember 9th at the Beacon\nTheatre in New York City.\nTickets to both of those\nevents are now available\nonline at hubermanlab.com/tour;\nthat's hubermanlab.com/tour.\nI do hope that you learn from an enjoy\nthe recording of the\nquestion and answer period\nthat follows this, and last,\nbut certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music plays]\n\"What is your most used protocol?\"\nI'm assuming that you mean the\nprotocol that I use the most.\nI genuinely do the\nmorning sunlight viewing.\nAnd this evening I went\nand looked at the sunset,\nevery single evening,\nand I absolutely do 10 to 30 minutes\nof some Non-Sleep Deep Rest\nprotocol, every single day,\nevery single day!\nThe reason I called it Non-Sleep Deep Rest\nis because while I love\nthe classic traditions of,\nand things like Yoga Nidra,\nmy fear was that if I\ncalled things Yoga Nidra,\nthat people would get spooked.\nBut I also have to say\nthat I rather loathe\nthe fact that scientists\nuse so many fancy terms,\nthat it also vaults information\nfrom the very people that fund the work.\nSo I have a kind of an ax to grind\nwith the scientific community too.\nSo Non-Sleep Deep Rest was my attempt\nto kind of put my arms around\na number of different things\nlike Yoga Nidra, which I\nhave great reverence for,\nand other tools like that.\nI do that usually in the early afternoon,\nor if I wake up first thing in the morning\nand I haven't slept\nenough, or not that well,\nI'll do 30 minutes of Yoga Nidra\nand I feel terrific after that.\nI'll just mention a brief anecdote.\nI learned about Yoga Nidra\nwhile researching a book\nthat I never wrote, that may\nor may not ever be published.\nI went and spent a week\nin a trauma center and addiction\ntreatment center in Florida\nand saw some amazing work,\nof some amazing people,\nand some amazing transformations\nand it was a big part\nof their daily routine,\nfor these people to do Yoga\nNidra and Non-Sleep Deep Rest\nand I thought they're\nreally onto something here.\nSo almost religiously for me,\nevery day, 10 to 30 minutes.\nNot that it matters,\nbut the CEO of Google's really into NSDR.\nI don't know him,\nbut he's written about\nthat a number of times.\n\"In Seattle, sunrise varies\nfrom 4:30 AM to 9:00 AM,\ndepending on season,\nare you recommending to vary\nyour wake-up/outside\ntime with the seasons?\"\nSomewhat.\nYou know, you don't need to\nsee the sun cross the horizon.\nThat would be great,\nbut not everyone can wake up with the sun.\nYou want to get so-called\nlow solar angle sunlight.\nWhy?\n'Cause of that yellow-blue contrast\nthat we talked about before.\nMany people wake up before the sun is out.\nIf that case, if you want to be awake,\nturn on as many bright lights as you can.\nUp here, I don't know, does anyone here,\nyou don't have to admit\nthis if you don't want to,\nbut maybe nod or raise your hand\nif you're comfortable with doing that.\nIn the winter you feel less well,\nor typically in the transition,\nyeah, it's huge up here.\n[audience laughing]\nIt's really, it's amazing.\nAnd then when you're on campus\nor that's where I've spent time\nand you see Rainier and it's like,\nthe blossoms are out\nand you feel almost high\nbecause that's dopamine, you know,\nanimals that have white\npelage in the winter,\nand then it turns dark in\nthe summer and spring months\nthat pathway, the melanin\npathway, is from tyrosine,\nwhich is the precursor to dopamine\nand also to melanin production in the fur.\nSo the whole system is linked.\nIt's not rigged, it's linked.\nSo what do I suggest?\nI suggest in the winter months,\ngetting 30 minutes of sunlight viewing.\nI know it's a lot,\nbut it's much better than\nfeeling lousy all day.\nAnd then the real key in the winter\nis to try and catch some\nsunlight before it goes down.\nIf you're indoors and it goes down\nand then you go outside and it's dark,\nyour brain and body\ndon't really know where they are in time.\nAnd then you flip on \"Ozark\"\nand you're watching \"Ozark\",\nand then you really don't\nknow where you are in time.\nI have one more episode.\nDon't tell me what happened.\nThat show is, when I was a postdoc,\nI used to recommend, \"The\nWire,\" to my competitors.\n[audience laughing]\nTrue.\n\"I go to sleep fired up,\nready and excited to do whatever it takes.\nWhen I wake up, that drive is depleted.\nWhy, and what can I do?\"\nInteresting.\nHave not heard that one before,\nbut if I were to venture\na guess, you know,\nwe didn't spend much time tonight\ntalking about the\nautonomic nervous system,\nthis kind of seesaw that\ntakes us from very alert,\npotentially panicked, but\nto very, very deep sleep;\neven, you know, God\nforbid we go into a coma.\nIt's 'cause the\nparasympathetic nervous system\nis overactive relative to the\nsympathetic nervous system;\nthe seesaw of autonomic function.\nYou may be sleeping very, very deeply.\nAnd when you are in deep, deep rest,\nthe last thing you want to do\nis get into that forward center of mass\nthinking, planning, predicting, right?\nIn, you know, again in Yoga Nidra again,\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest,\nthere's this common theme in the script\nof going from thinking\nand doing and predicting\nto being and feeling, they say.\nAnd I'm not making fun of them\nas the moment I hear that,\nI go, \"Oh, just I want to be and feel.\"\nWhat are you doing?\nYou're actually just\nmoving into sensation,\nbut no planning, right?\nThere's nothing mysterious about it.\nSensation, but no planning.\nNow in sleep,\na very deeply parasympathetic\nsleep state, what's happening?\nYou actually, that visual aperture\nis actually so big, you're\nnot in panoramic vision,\nyour eyes are actually closed.\nSpace and time are from\npast, present, and future\nare invited into your thinking.\nYou're in a deep, deep state of relaxation\nand it may be, Dustin,\nthat when you're waking up,\nyou're having a hard time\ntransitioning out of that\nbecause you're sleeping so deeply.\nYou may be waking up mid-sleep cycle.\nMany people find it useful to set an alarm\nso that they wake up\nat the end of a 90 minute\nso-called ultradian cycle.\nThere's some sleep apps\nthat do this on the phone.\nI can't recall their names,\nbut so rather than sleeping seven hours,\nyou might be better off sleeping six\nor seven and a half hours, right?\nWaking up at the end of one\nof these 90 minute cycles.\nTry that.\nThat would be consistent\nwith what we know about the biology.\nBut I think it's common to,\nif you sleep very deeply,\nto wake up and not necessarily\nwant to spring out of bed.\nI've heard of these people\nthat just want to spring out\nof bed and attack the day;\nJocko Willink, 4:30 in the morning,\nhis Casio phone, and his watch.\nI'm seeing his watch when,\nand it's like eight for me.\nI'm like, \"Wow,\" like again,\nthese people are amazing.\nI must be doing something wrong.\nBut these are, you know,\nI don't wake up that way.\nYou know?\nLike Tiger, I'm like, I\nwant water, I want sunlight,\n90 minutes later I want caffeine.\nYeah.\n\"What are some of your favorite books\nthat have had the biggest impact on you?\"\nKyle G, thank you, Kyle.\nGosh, so many!\nYou know, for non-fiction, well,\nOliver Sack's autobiography,\n\"On the Move,\"\nhad a profound impact on me.\nYou know, people hated him?\nThe scientific community\ntried to kick him out.\nThey said horrible things about him;\ncreated all sorts of scandals.\nIt wasn't until \"Awakenings\"\nbecame a blockbuster movie\nthat suddenly he got\nappointments at NYU and Columbia.\nHa!\nThen now they wanted him\nback; the revered neurologist.\nLike incredible, right?\nBut he was also a real seeker\nin the cuttlefish thing.\nAnd he had a lot of\ninternal struggles too,\nsome of which I relate\nto, some of which I don't.\nActually, I've been in touch\nwith his former partner\nbecause I actually moved to\nTopanga Canyon for a short while\njust 'cause Oliver lived there.\nI thought, \"If I go there, I'll\nactually finish this book.\"\nGuess what?\nJust moving someplace doesn't\nallow you to finish a book.\nHe lived in Topanga so I\nwas like, \"That's the key.\"\nIt didn't work.\nAnd people were wondering why\nI was hanging around\ntheir house all the time\n'cause it was Oliver's former home.\nSo that's an amazing book,\nand tells you my obsessive nature.\nThe other books that have had\na profound influence on me,\nI would say in the non-fiction realm,\nwell I learned how to make a decent steak\nand a few other simple recipes, not well,\nfrom Tim Ferris's book,\n\"The Four Hour Chef,\"\n'cause I really needed help.\nThat was a fun one.\nI like Robert Greene's book, \"Mastery,\"\nbecause I've had amazing mentors\nand that book is all about finding mentors\nand assigning mentors to you,\neven if you don't know them.\nAnd as you can tell from\nmy stories about Oliver,\nwho I never met, and a few other folks,\nthat I've just decided\nthat they don't know it,\nbut I'm mentoring them,\nthat they're mentoring me, excuse me,\nthat book was really important for me.\nAnd that mentor-mentee relationships\nalways involve a breakup,\neither by death, or by\ndecision, or by consequence,\nto your circumstance rather.\nThere's, something happens,\nand they're supposed to break.\nYou're not supposed to\napprentice with somebody forever.\nThat was an interesting book for me.\nI would say in the fiction realm,\n[Andrew sighs]\nI would say in the fiction\nrealm, it's all childhood books\n'cause it's been a long time\nsince I've read fiction.\nI read a lot of poetry. I'm\na big Wendell Berry fan.\nI like poetry because poetry to me is,\nis like the subconscious, it,\nthe structure is all messed up\nand you think you understand\nwhat they're talking about\nbut you don't really know.\nAnd so it always feels\nimportant and consequential,\neven though, you know, it's\nyour own interpretation.\nAnd then I love the\npsychologists. I love Jung.\nI love Erikson.\nI love the psychologists\nand could read endlessly\nabout the early days of attachment theory\nand things like that\nbecause I find that\nstuff to be fascinating.\nSo those books have been a lot of fun\nand I love picture books with animals.\n[audience laughing]\nAnd so if you can get a hold of\nJoel Sartore's Instagram\naccount, the \"Photo Ark,\"\nhe decided to take pictures\nof every animal on the planet,\nespecially the ones that are endangered.\nHe's a amazing photographer,\nbut his books are even better\nso if you like animal books.\n\"What excites you most\nabout the future research\nof mental health treatment,\nparticularly anxiety and depression?\"\nOi! Michael, thank you, Michael.\nWell there, I think that\nwe're in an exciting time.\nI am, I'll just reveal my biases,\nI'm quite pessimistic at the idea\nthat we're going to have\nbetter medication soon for most things.\nWhat I do think we are\nstarting to approach\nis a time in which we understand\nhow broad categories of drugs\nimpact broad categories of chemicals,\nwhich kind of shift our mind\nin broad categories of directions.\nWhat does all that mean?\nI think we're starting to\nrealize that because there are\ndifferent receptors\nfor all these chemicals\nall over the brain and body,\nthat that side effect-less drug\nis unlikely to exist for mental health,\nbut that the combination of,\nmaybe some pharmacology,\nbut especially behavioral\ntools, people actually learning\nhow to drive this thing that\nwe call our nervous system\nis potentially helpful,\nmaybe very helpful.\nNow in cases like schizophrenia, autism,\nand I didn't put those next\nto one another for any reason\nby the way, OCD,\neating disorders,\nand I'm very mindful of the fact that,\nyou know, anorexia is\nthe most lethal of all the\npsychiatric disorders, right?\nAmazing and sad fact.\nI think for those conditions,\nwe are soon going to enter a time\nin which it's going to be\ncombination behavioral,\ndrug therapy, and yes,\nbrain-machine interface.\nI don't mean putting chips\ndown below the skull.\nI think there's going to be,\nand there are things happening now\nof people using devices\nlike virtual reality,\nas well as transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation,\nplacing a magnet on a\nparticular location on the head\ncombined with a particular,\nmaybe drugs, maybe psychedelics,\nmaybe not, to enhance plasticity.\nI urge a vote for psychedelics\nand I want to make a serious\npoint about psychedelics.\nFive years ago, when\nI, well, four years ago\nwhen I started doing a bit\nof public-facing stuff,\nI was absolutely terrified\nto say that word; terrified.\nI thought I'd lose my job.\nI really did. I thought,\n\"Don't say psychedelics.\"\nAnd I'll be very honest, you know,\nI, for me,\nI think that the clinical data\non MDMA and on psilocybin\nare very interesting, very interesting.\nI don't think they are\nthe first and only pass\nat rewiring the brain,\nbut it is clear that the brain\ncan enter a state of\nheightened learning capacity,\nbut it needs to be\ndirected towards something.\nThe goal of opening plasticity,\njust, it opens plasticity.\nThat's not the goal.\nIt's like running; the goal isn't running.\nThe goal is to run in\na particular direction.\nSo what I think is really needed\nis to drive that plasticity\nin particular directions.\nAnd I would love to see more\ndirected use of those in,\nof course, the safe clinical\nsetting where it's appropriate.\nAnd a guest on the\npodcast, Matthew Johnson,\nwho's at Johns Hopkins,\nI asked him, \"What's the\ndeal with the microdosing?\"\nAnd you know what his answer\nwas? I was very surprised.\nHe said, \"Macrodose.\"\nAnd I thought, okay, I'm\nnot a guy who, you know,\nI'm not into, I'm not,\nI'm not a pushing this.\nI'm not a proponent. I said,\n\"You're kidding me. Why?\nWhy would you say this?\"\nThis guy runs an NIH funded lab\nat Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\nI thought, \"Why?\"\nAnd he said,\n\"Because the one session\nwith a trained professional\nthat's triggering rewiring plasticity,\nthat's guided, is,\" as far\nas they know from the data,\nyou can go back and listen\nto, these are his words,\nnot mine, but he's the\nexpert in this area,\n\"are encouraging plasticity\nin a particular direction.\"\nAnd he thinks that that's far more useful\nthan just kind of nudging\nthe system a little bit\nwithout any particular goal or outcome.\nVery interesting, and very surprising.\nAnd again, a trained academic\nat one of the most elite\ninstitutions in the world.\nI think we're in very exciting\ntimes, for those compounds.\nAnd they're like,\nthere are studies at\nStanford and elsewhere\non ketamine and other\nthings, but it's early days.\nYoung people should be very cautious,\nyoung, young people,\nand adults should be cautious,\nespecially people with\npreexisting psychiatric issues\nand people who have a\npropensity for addiction\nalthough some of those compounds\nare being used to treat addiction.\nSo I'd be an idiot and I would be lying,\nif I didn't say\nthat it is a very exciting\ntime for psychedelic therapies.\n[audience cheering and applauding]\n\"Where do you see the biggest area?\"\nand I've done only one clinical trial.\nTrue. I was a part I took\npart in one clinical trial.\nSo I don't speak from a\nlot of experience there,\njust a little bit.\nI was a subject in that trial.\n\"Where do you see the biggest area\nfor performance enhancement\nwithin the elite athletes and operators\nthat already hit marks of\nproper sleep and nutrition?\"\nMeg Young, thanks for your question, Meg.\nYeah, I think that, well, first of all,\nvery few of them hit\nmarks for proper sleep.\nBut for those that do, so once\nyou have your sleep dialed in\nand you got your nutrition dialed in,\nand the motivational component is there,\nI think where there's a lot\nof work still to be done\nand where people can really\nget outsized effects,\nis in this weird little\ncavern of human existence\nthat we call creativity.\nAnd I didn't have time to\ntalk about it tonight, but\nthere's a very unique brain\nstate that we call creativity,\nwhich is taking preexisting neural maps\nand starting to combine\nthem in unique ways\nto create new ways of performance.\nPerformance can be basically\nsummarized in any domain\nas essentially four stages.\nYou have unskilled, skilled, mastery,\nwhich is when the brain\ncan generate movements\nor cognitive computations that are,\ncreate very predictable outcomes\nand then there's this fourth\ntier, this fourth layer,\nwhich is virtuosity.\nAnd virtuosity, by definition,\nmeans inviting back in a\ncomponent of uncertainty.\nWhat this looks like in terms of operators\nor this looks like in terms of athletes,\nor even we can say musicians,\nor people who are in the cognitive fields,\nor poets, or writers,\nis what it means is introducing that\nuncertainty about what's\ngoing to happen next\nand the way to do that is\nto destabilize the system.\nIn other words, to create states of mind\nin which there are literally\nsensory disruptions.\nIt's like, like what I would\nlike to see is more training\nin a kind of \"funhouse of\nmirrors\" type environment.\nThat's when you start to see\nincredible performances emerge.\nAnd virtuosos invite in uncertainty,\nthey actually don't know what\nthey're going to do next.\nAnd so this becomes a little\nbit of a vague concept\nand what I'm about to tell you next\nmight seem a little silly,\nbut one of the best ways\nto access creative states\nis to, no surprise, use your visual system\nto view things that are\nhighly unstable and uncertain.\nI don't just love fish tanks;\nI love staring at videos\nof aquariums in Tokyo,\nand actually watching the fish\nbecause it's completely unpredictable.\nThere's some evidence that\ndoing things like that\nor people would say,\n\"Oh, I was in the shower,\"\nor, \"I took a walk in nature\nand then I had this idea.\"\nI actually don't think it\nwas the walk or the shower,\nit's that nature is\nfilled with unpredictable\nvisual stimuli, auditory stimuli.\nWhen you can predict what's\ngoing to happen next,\nyou have very little opportunity\nto uplevel your game so to speak.\nIt's only by way of\nunpredictable sensory input\nthat you can do that.\nSo if you're a coach,\nor you're working with people\nwho are very high level performers,\ndo you want them to stand\non one leg and spin around\nand then do what they're doing?\nNot necessarily.\nWhat you want to do\nis try and get them into brain states\nthat are different than the\nbrain states that they're in\nwhen they normally enter their practice.\nThe liminal state between\nsleep and waking, excuse me,\nthe liminal state between sleep and waking\nis a very powerful one\nfor accessing creativity.\nMany people access ideas\nas they're waking up in the morning,\nthey have great insights,\nother people while strolling in nature.\nI don't think it's the\nstrolling or the waking up.\nI think it's the lack of,\nas we call it top-down\nregulation on rules.\nYou are able to access\ncombinations of neural maps\nthat are unusual.\nSo you can play with this a little bit.\nA lot of people throughout history\nhave used compounds,\ndrugs, to do this, right?\nGreat writers would get\ndrunk and then try and write\nor wake up and they would,\nthe amount of self-abuse\nthat people including\nathletes and creatives\nput themselves through to try and capture\nthese windows of cognitive\nability is pretty intense.\nAnd I don't think that's a good idea.\nI think one should be an explorer\nand try and find these cognitive states\nin ways that are non-destructive.\nI'm starting to sound like\nmy mother, with all this.\n[audience laughing]\nHeel flips on lock. No kick flips.\nNext question.\n[audience laughing]\n[scattered applause]\nThere's some skateboarders\nin the audience;\nmy first non-biologic family.\nThere's some amazing\nskateboarders in this audience\nand I'm not going to be the one\ndoing a kick flip anytime soon,\nbut they're great to have.\nOne of the reasons we built the podcast\nwith the help of the great Mike Blabac\nis because I learned a long time ago\nthat if you want things done right,\nand you want to do them\noutside the lane lines,\nand you want to have control\nover how things come across,\nyou do it with skateboarders,\n'cause I didn't come from a\ncommunity where, you know,\nI didn't have parents at my sports games\nand things like that\nso, thanks to the\nskateboarders and the misfits\nand the those folks.\n\"Do you have any tips on\nhow to improve memory?\"\nYes, Ron Vered. Yes!\nOkay.\nThis is a wild literature and I love it\nand it's changing the\nway that I do things.\nI thought that to remember things\nyou're supposed to get\nreally, really excited,\nreally focused, and remember them.\nGuess what? That's not how you do it.\nThere are data,\nand there are stories going\nback to medieval times\nthat they used to teach kids things\nand then throw them in the river.\nThere's a beautiful Annual\nReview of Neuroscience\nwritten by the late James McGaugh,\na brilliant researcher who\ntaught me that, in this review.\nAnd it turns out that if you\nwant to remember something\nyou want to spike adrenaline\nafter you acquired that\ninformation, after!\nThat means the double\nespresso and the ice bath\nafter you study for\nmath, immediately after.\nAnd you think about this, you know,\nthat makes perfect sense, right?\nThink about the one trial learning\nthat nobody wants to experience,\nwhich is a car accident\nor some traumatic thing.\nYou didn't get the spike\nof adrenaline first.\nYou got the spike of adrenaline after.\nSo again, you know,\nI discourage the use\nof excessive stimulants\nor you know, anything like that.\nBut if you're going to try\nand remember information,\nyou need to get your brain and body\ninto a high autonomic arousal state.\nLiterally you need to deploy\nadrenaline into your system\nafter you have made the attempt\nto learn some information.\nSo much so that if you\ngive people a beta blocker\nafter learning emotional information,\nthey don't learn it as well.\nIncredible, just incredible\ndata in animals and humans.\nThis is the beautiful work\nof Larry Cahill at UC Irvine\nand James McGaugh.\nSo that's how I would focus\non remembering things better.\nAnd it's also true that\nif you tell yourself\nthat something's really important to you,\nyou'll be able to learn it better.\nIf you meet people and\nthey tell you their name\nand you forget it two seconds later, well,\nyou should probably be\nthinking, and now I do this,\nI meet people and I think,\n\"Okay, what terrible\nthing did this person do?\"\nJust try and spike my adrenaline\nor something like that.\nIt's a terrible trick, but\nhaven't figured out a better way,\nbut that's actually one\ndata-supported way to do that.\nEasily a dozen or more studies\nin humans on that very topic.\n\"How do you manage\nsocial media addiction?\"\nPaul.\nOi, well we should be careful\nwith the use of the word addiction\nbecause here, I think\nit's entirely appropriate.\nWhen you are engaging in\na behavior over, and over. and over again,\nand you're thinking to yourself,\n\"This isn't even that interesting,\"\nyou're officially addicted.\nThat's the litmus test for addiction.\nNot, \"This feels so good.\"\nPeople talk about the\ndopamine hits of social media.\nThose only come at the beginning,\nbut then when you find yourself scrolling,\nyou're like, \"What am I doing?\"\nMaybe it's that narrow visual aperture;\nyou're a hypnotized chicken,\nbut maybe also you are\nseeking more dopamine hits\nbecause guess what?\nThat dopamine wave pool is depleted,\nat least for that activity.\nIt is true that dopamine,\nyou have a baseline and\nthen you have peaks on,\non that ride on that baseline.\nI do think that we can have\ndopamine for one behavior,\nand not for another,\nbut it's a generalized phenomenon.\nSo how do you manage it?\nYou have to stop seeking\nwithin social media.\nAnd so I've taken on the\npractice of turning off my phone\nfor a couple hours each day.\nIt's incredibly hard.\nPeople get really upset too, by the way,\ncause if you haven't noticed\nthese tethers that people expect.\nWe recorded a podcast\nrecently and it, so I,\nI don't want to go into\ntoo much depth now,\nabout attachment and grief.\nAnd, you know, we all have a map now,\nyou know, you understand\nwhat the maps are,\nof space, time, and a dimension called\ncloseness to everyone that we know\nspace, where they are,\ntime, when they are,\ndead, alive, when will I\nsee them again et cetera,\nand closeness.\nAnd the phone has allowed us to tap into\nspace, time, and this closeness map,\nwhich define all our attachments,\non a very regular basis.\nSo you can understand why\nit's so valuable to people.\nYou know, the plane lands\nand everyone's texting.\nThe planes, take off, everyone's texting.\nIt's like, \"Where are you?\"\nWell, the plane's in the air,\nthere's this thing called flight tracker.\nNo one cares about that anymore.\nYou want to hear from the person.\nSo I do think that,\nI used to do an every odd hour of the day\nmy phone was off,\nand like half the relationships\nin my life disappeared.\nThey couldn't talk, they\ncouldn't tolerate it.\nI loved it, but I loved them too.\nSo I would say take breaks.\nAnd I would say at least an hour.\nAnd if you find yourself excited\nto get back on the phone,\nthat excitement, that\nis the dopamine system.\nSo you can kind of learn\nwhere it is for you.\nBut if you find yourself\nscrolling mindlessly\nand it's not doing anything for you,\nyou are driving that wave pool\ndown, down, down, down, down,\nso hopefully that analogy will help.\nIt's weird to call myself Dr. Huberman.\nIn my business if you refer to\nyourself in the third person,\nit means you're officially a narcissist.\n[audience laughing]\nSo I'm just going to start with,\n\"Were you nervous tonight and if so,\nwhat did you do to prepare?\"\nBrianne, you saw my\nnervousness, didn't you?\nNo, the, I asked myself that question.\nI was excited, and I think\nI'm good at lying to myself\nand telling myself that autonomic arousal\nthat might be nervousness is excitement.\nBut in truth, I wasn't, I\nwas and am really excited\nto tell you all these\nstories and about biology.\nI know this might sound\nlike a little bit of a line,\nbut I actually don't feel myself as a,\nlike a person when I do the\npodcast or I do this stuff.\nI took a walk before I got\nhere and I have to be careful.\nThere are only two\ntopics that make me cry.\nOne is talking about my bulldog.\nThe other is talking\nabout my graduate advisor.\nSo I have to be very careful,\nbut I took a walk and I\nimagined that they were here\nand, I know, and don't make me cry.\nLex Friedman made me cry on a podcast\nand it was really unfair.\nAnd he was like digging and digging and\nthere are a few people in the\naudience that know Costello.\nAnd it's like, you know,\nand I just kept thinking to\nmyself before coming in here,\nlike, you know, I love\nthem and miss them and I,\nCostello would be entirely\nbored with this whole thing.\nSo I distracted myself a\nbit and not so nervous.\nI do get nervous about\nthings, sure, I'm human.\nBut when it comes to biology,\nI think I still feel like that little kid\nwho just wants to tell you\nall this stuff, you know, so,\nyou know, I can't help it.\n\"Is learning from failure\nequal to learning from success?\nIs one more efficient than the other?\"\nRachel, thanks for your question.\nWell, on a trial-by-trial basis,\nwe know that when you fail at an attempt,\non the next attempt,\nyour forebrain is in a\nposition to engage better.\nAnd this makes total sense, right?\nYou feel that frustration [alarm buzzer]\nand you want to get the next one, right?\nWell, you're harboring,\nor I should say funneling\nmore neural resources,\nyour focus, that aperture tightens.\nNow you have to be mindful of that too,\nbecause when you have a\nfailure and then you're like,\nyou're going to hit the bulls.\nI'm thinking about a dart board,\n'cause I'm terrible at darts, you know,\nsober I'm terrible at darts.\nI don't even drink.\nSo that next trial,\npart of the problem is,\nis that focus can narrow\nso much that you can start\nto lose access to information\nthat might help you.\nIf you were just to relax a little bit\nand dilate that focus a\nlittle bit, but in general,\non a trial-by-trial basis focus is the cue\nthat your nervous system\nis going to be positioned\nto learn better on the next trial.\nNow in terms of life experiences, gosh,\nI wish for everyone fewer\nfailures and more successes,\nbut you know, failures keep you humble.\nAnd I've had a lot of 'em.\nI mean, if people ever\nwanted and they, you know,\nI'd be happy to tell you about, I mean,\nI've made a ton of mistakes\nin life, a ton of mistakes.\nSome of those were\nmistakes of persistence,\nlike dumb decisions.\nI kept like, \"It's going to\nchange. It's going to change.\"\nAnd it's clearly never going to change.\nAnd then some were failures of misjudgment\nabout other people or situations.\nAnd a lot of them were just plain failures\nlike the experiment didn't work,\nor the, it just wasn't the right thing.\nAnd you try and reframe those.\nI do think that we owe it to ourselves\nand to the people that we know\nto try and generate\nsome wins here and there\nand try and help other\npeople generate wins.\nYou know, in running a lab over the years\nand I still do,\nyou realize that you want your\nstudents to publish a paper\nand feel that success pretty early\nso that they can experience,\nA, how much work it is\nso they pick problems wisely,\nbut, B, so they can feel that,\nlike, \"Oh, I can do this.\"\nAnd I think that, you know,\nthis gets into the psychological as well.\nI think that yes, failures\nhelp, but successes help.\nAnd there, I think, you know,\nI function best in a team.\nAnd I think that for those of you that are\nfeel like you're fighting\nsome challenge alone,\nI do think that there are\ngreat resources to be had\nin trying to access other, you know,\nother people as sources of support.\nI think that that's a great tool.\nThere's this whole literature,\nscientific literature,\naround social connection\nand how that can help us\nreframe motivation and goals.\nAnyway, maybe that's a topic\nto expand on another time.\nBut failure is important\non a trial, trial by basis.\nPeople who\ndon't experience enough wins\nfor a long period of time,\nthe brain is a prediction\nmachine after all\nand they start to predict failure\nso takes a bit more work to\nwedge oneself out of that.\n\"When are you going to\nstart training jiu-jitsu?\nLex made me ask.\"\nRyan Flores.\nOkay. Here's the story with that.\nLex said, \"Do you want to try jiu-jitsu?\"\nI said, \"Sure.\"\nLex said,\n\"Okay, it'll be great to\nshow people beginner's mind.\"\nI said, \"Sure.\"\nWe went and did a jiu-jitsu class.\nHe was very nice; nice,\nnice, Russian, nice.\nLike, \"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\"\nThen he puts it on the internet\nwith me in a rear naked,\nhim putting me in a rear naked choke,\nit was actually Lex Friedman\nchoking out Andrew Huberman,\nThere, I just talked about\nmyself in the third person,\ndammit, edit that one.\nI have not had the time for jiu-jitsu.\nI like my ears the way they are, you know.\nHave you ever seen these\npeople that do jiu-jitsu?\nTheir ears literally look like\nstumps. No, I should do it.\nIt looks like a great sport.\nAnd unlike the other sports\nI've been involved in my life,\nboxing, please don't do it.\nIt's not healthy.\nSkateboarding and all this,\nyou don't really damage\nyour head doing jiu-jitsu.\nSo no.\nI'm going to get you\nback for that one Lex.\nOkay.\n\"Can you go through,\"\noh wow, John Edwards.\nThere's a joke that my\nfriends used to tell\nabout the supplements I take.\nThey used to say, someone would say,\n\"What supplements do you take?\"\nAnd they would just go, \"All of them.\"\nI don't take all of them, but\nI have been very systematic.\nFor about 30 years,\nI've been interested in\ncompounds that change the nervous system.\nAnd I do think that the,\nthe events of the last few years\nhave changed the way that\npeople view supplements.\nI think that more people\nare starting to think about\nhow to take better care of their health.\nAnd they, people are realizing that\nobviously, great sleep, mindsets,\nsocial connection, exercise,\nnutrition and so forth\nare very important.\nBut I, I actually don't know anybody,\ngranted, I run with a strange crowd,\nbut I don't know anybody\nthat doesn't take something nowadays.\nYou know, I could go\nthrough the whole list,\nbut I would say the\nmost fundamental things\nand there's no product pitch here,\nthe most fundamental things are\nthe things that are going to support\nyour kind of foundational health.\nSo for that's going to mean mainly\ngetting either by food\nsources or supplements\nis going to be getting\nsufficient amounts of these\nessential fatty acids.\nSo important.\nFor some people that's\ntaking liquid fish oil,\nfor some people it's a capsule,\nfor somebody that's eating fish.\nI don't like the way fish\ntastes unless I'm in Seattle,\nby the way, the seafood here is amazing,\nnot so much in California.\nSo I think the essential fatty acids,\nand then I'm big on the data,\ndare I say, out of Stanford,\nJustin Sonnenburg's lab\nand Chris Gardner's lab\nthat these fermented foods\nof which all these cultures\nhave interesting fermented foods,\nkefir, and sauerkraut, and kimchi, and,\nyou know, pick your fermented food.\nThat those seem to really encourage\nhealth of the gut microbiome.\nSo I started eating a lot of those\nand taking no probiotics\nexcept in, you know,\na few of the supplements\nthat I was already taking.\nSo I'm not trying to dodge the question,\nbut I think, by and large,\nif you're eating well\nand doing the other\nfoundational behaviors as well,\nyou can get it way with\na minimum of supplements.\nD3, it seems to be a lot\nof people deficient in D3,\nbut not everybody.\nSo I think that those are the main ones.\nHowever, I do think that nutrition\nshould be the primary entry point.\nAgain, it should be behaviors\nfirst, then nutrition,\nthen supplements, then prescription drugs,\nonly if you need them.\nAnd then, you know, for some people,\ntheir brain-machine interface\nlike TMS and things like\nthat are going to be useful,\nbut behaviors change your nervous system,\nno supplement actually rewires you\nor changes your nervous\nsystem: behaviors do that.\nI hope I didn't dodge\nthat question entirely.\nI do take some of the things\nthat we talk about on the\npodcast to do some focused work,\nsometimes alpha-GPC,\nbut lately I've been\ndoing this whole thing\nof cold water exposure\nto spike my adrenaline,\n'cause I hate it,\nand it spikes my adrenaline after learning\nbased on the McGaugh and Cahill data.\n\"What would be your best\none or two pieces of advice\nor recommended protocol for\nimproving learning and retention\nfor graduate students\nin science and medicine?\nWe try to sleep sometimes.\"\nThank you, JD.\nOh great. You're at UW, JD.\nSo, you know,\nI used to teach this course\nat Cold Spring Harbor\non career development for scientists\nand the there's a lot in there,\nbut the two things that\nare most important are,\nI, for sake of answering this\nquestion, I would say, are,\nfind non-destructive ways\nto reset your dopamine\nand your energy levels\nand do those at least every three days.\nSo for me, it was kind of a,\na tough thing to take a\nlong walk, or to spend,\nI used to work really hard on Mondays,\nreally hard on Tuesdays,\nand I would not go in until\nthe afternoon on Wednesdays\nand sometimes not at all.\nAnd then I go in Thursday, Friday,\nand work really, really hard\nand then not at all on Saturday\nand then maybe do a little bit\nof work from home on Sunday.\nAnd I was very productive that way.\nBut those breaks are absolutely key\nand it's not encouraged so\nmuch in academic or tech\nor maybe anything now.\nI hear about so much stress and overwork.\nI say, you just do it\nand define the culture\nand let the results and your focus\nbe the thing that defines you,\nnot how many hours you're in there.\nBut I realize there's\na huge cognitive load\nand energetic load and for that,\nI do think these Non-Sleep\nDeep Rest protocols\nare where it comes in really handy.\nThere are at least two\nfaculty I know at Stanford.\nOne whose a so-called\nHoward Hughes investigator,\nwho is big, those are\nbig deal appointments.\nThey get tons of money,\net cetera, et cetera,\nand they do amazing\nscience most of the time.\nThese individuals certainly do.\nAnd they take two 20 minute\nnaps, per day, in their office.\nWhen this guy came and visited me,\nyears ago when I was at\na different university,\nhe took the time that we were\nsupposed to meet in my office\nand talk about data, he\nasked if he could take a nap.\n[audience laughs]\nAnd he gave a great talk that afternoon.\nSo there you go.\nI do think you have to take\ncontrol of your schedule\nand do those things.\nAnd I hope that helps.\nAnd then of course,\nfor some people, exercise and\nso on is the way they reset.\n\"What research or work are you doing\nor that your colleagues are doing\nthat you're most excited about lately?\"\nGlen, yeah.\nOne project in particular,\nI hope this paper gets accepted soon,\nit's been out for review forever\nand so if the reviewers\nare in the audience,\nplease just tell us one\nway or the other, you know?\nWe did a very large scale\nstudy during the pandemic,\nwe meaning David Spiegel and I,\nand an amazing PhD named Melis\nshe now has two last names, excuse me,\nBalban, Yilmaz Balban.\nAnd Melis\nwe essentially equipped people\nwith remote monitoring devices\nand measured sleep and\nheart rate variability\nand a bunch of stress and\nbunch of other things.\nAnd we gave them\na very brief set of breathing protocols\nand it turns out\nthat this thing that I'm talking\nabout a lot on the podcast,\nthese days of this double\ninhale, long exhale,\nthe so-called, \"physiological sigh,\"\nwas the most effective breathing practice\nfor allowing people to control\ntheir heart rate variability,\nreduce overall heart\nrate, access better sleep,\nand these were extremely short protocols.\nSo I'm very excited about this.\nI didn't discover physiological sighs.\nI love the idea\nthat people can do a very\nbrief protocol, once a day,\nmaybe even just while\nwalking down the street\nor in the moment\nand actually learn to control\nthat autonomic seesaw better.\nSo I'm very excited about that.\nAnd then we are gearing\nup to do some studies\non people who have more\nsevere forms of anxiety\nand panic attack, using\nmainly respiration,\nbut also looking at some of these eye,\nvision-related ways of\ncontrolling the nervous system.\nI love that stuff.\nIf I keep talking about it,\nI'm going to give you a data presentation\nso I'm going to turn around.\n\"How does dopamine\nfactor into neuroplasticity if at all?\"\nColin, great question.\nIt's a very strong trigger of plasticity,\nso much so in fact that\nthere's some work that shows\nif you stimulate with an electrode,\nthe brain area that releases dopamine,\nand you pair that with anything,\nanything, even just like\nan eight kilohertz tone,\n[vocalizes a high tone]\nthe brain remaps and it's like,\n\"Oh, I love that eight kilohertz tone.\"\nRemember dopamine is\ndumb, and is just dumb.\nAnd it is just, you\nknow, it's like Costello\nwhen he sits this dog,\nI could hang a rope from a tree.\nThis dog was so lazy he wouldn't\ncross a room for a steak.\nYou had to give the steak to him,\n[audience laughing]\nbut it would run across a field.\nHe would run and jump on\nand hold onto that rope,\nand he would sometimes\nbite through his lip\nwith like blood dripping down.\nAnd I was like, \"Oh my gosh,\"\nit was like breaking my heart.\nHe loved every sit, that's\ndopamine; turns us into idiots.\nHe was as smart about what\nhe needed to be smart about.\nDopamine.\nSo if you trigger dopamine\nrelease with Ritalin, Adderall,\nto a lesser extent L-Tyrosine,\nand certainly please don't do this,\nbut cocaine, amphetamine,\nwhatever you're doing\nseems super interesting.\nIt's true. And that's why\nit's such a slippery slope.\nIt makes anything you're doing\nseem interesting and important.\nAnd actually I'll use this\nas an opportunity to say\nsomething about the\npsychedelic thing earlier.\nOne of the issues with MDMA,\nit's a very unusual brain\nstate: it's high dopamine,\nhigh serotonin, completely\nsynthetic compound.\nThere are other things in\nthere that it does as well.\nOne of the problems with people I see\nwith the problem with\npeople just taking MDMA,\njust at a basic level,\nis that if you're not pushing that\ntowards some therapeutic\noutcome, music sounds amazing.\nEverything feels and sounds amazing,\nbut it's a very neurochemically,\nyou know, severe state.\nSo that's why I think\nif people are going to\nexplore those things,\ndo it as part of\none of the university-supported\nclinical trials.\nOne of the reas-\nthose drugs make everything\nseem interesting,\neven stuff that's not\nterribly interesting.\nNow they also have\nthe potential for trauma healing capacity.\nThese are the MAPS studies and so on.\nSo you have to be very careful\nwith what you pair with dopamine\nand what you pair dopamine with.\nAnd for those of you\nthat are high sensation\nseeking, novelty seeking,\nand everything's interesting to you,\nand you want more, and\nmore, and more, experiences,\nI, you basically have a\neight cylinder car in you\nand you need to be very careful\nhow you drive that thing.\nLike any high performance automobile,\nit's going to spend more time in the shop,\n[audience laughing]\nso learn to drive appropriately.\n\"What advice can you\noffer to future scientists\nwho want to make an impact like you have?\"\nRyan O'Boyle, get tenure first.\nNo, I'm kidding.\nSo I have this weird history in science\nand I'm not looking for sympathy here,\nbut my undergraduate\nadvisor, who I adored,\nhe's like a father to me,\nmy graduate advisor,\nand my postdoc advisor,\nwho I also adored, all three of them died:\nsuicide, cancer, cancer, really young.\nSo the joke in my field is\nyou don't want me to work for you.\nBut in all seriousness,\nall three of them had a\nreally morbid sense of humor,\nall amazing people,\nbut it is this kind of\nweird curse that I've had.\nSo what scientists, you\nknow, what advice, you know,\nwell, Ben Barres,\nthe late Ben Barres died\nof pancreatic cancer,\nan amazing individual.\nThey're actually making a\ndocumentary about Ben's life.\nHe's transgendered. He\nwas a totally irreverent.\nHe said whatever he thought.\nHe offended everybody.\nHe was awesome. Brilliant too.\nBen and I had a conversation\nas he was dying.\nI recorded a lot of conversations with him\nand I told him I was interested in doing\npublic-facing education.\nAnd he said,\n\"Well, you're tenured now and,\npeople are going to be upset,\nand they're not going to like it,\nand your colleagues are\nprobably going to hate it\nso whatever you do and\nyou better make it good.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Wow, that\ndoesn't really help much, Ben.\"\nAnd he said,\n\"You know, you seem to\nhave a compulsion for it.\"\nSo, he was right.\nI think that if you are\nexcited about science,\nand sharing what you know, then do that.\nAnd even if it seems super nerdy,\nI mean, there are these ento-\nI think they call\nthemselves entomologists,\nthe insect people,\nthey, I mean they make insects\nseem really, really cool.\nAnd if you are excited about\nspindle kinetics or whatever,\nyou know, tell people\nabout it, I really mean it.\nI think that the one caveat is that\nI do think it's important\nto get a formal, rigorous\ntraining in it first.\nI think that you'll go further\nand faster in the long run.\nAnd there's some amazing people out there.\nThere's a postdoc at Stanford.\nI think his name is Ben Rein,\nI think if you shorten it up on Instagram,\nit's actually brain,\nbrein, 'cause he works out\nhe talks about brain science\nso that's why it's weird:\nB B R E I N.\nHe does a great job.\nAnd he's a really good example of someone\nwho's still on the ascent with his career,\ndoing serious science, and\ndoing science communication.\nBut you have to be careful,\nit's time consuming.\nLook, you, people will\ndislike you for whatever.\nI made the mistake once of\nsaying that I eat butter.\nApparently that's a sin on the internet.\nI like little bits of\nactually like a lot of butter,\nbut try and eat little bits of butter.\nBut somehow it's like,\nthere's this idea that\nI eat sticks of butter.\nSo you have to be careful.\n[audience laughing]\nLike, I mean, the things I've\nheard, I heard I was dead.\nThat was cool.\nSo you have to be careful\nand remember everything\nis stamped into the,\nthe cloud now and the metaverse\nor whatever it's called.\nSo I would say, here are\nthe rules that we have\nat the podcast and on\nhere's the rules that\nI created for myself.\nI truly don't do it for me.\nI do it 'cause I think\npeople want to hear about it,\nbut I've been telling myself\nthat since I was six years old.\nThe other thing is never, ever, ever do it\njust for your own gratification.\nYou should really try and think,\n\"Is anyone going to get\nanything useful out of this,\npotentially?\"\nThat's the goal.\nIf you're doing that,\nit'll work out for you.\nIf you are thinking about\nhow to get followers\nor something like that,\nit ain't going to work out.\nThat's my advice.\n\"Is age 66 too old for neuroplasticity?\"\nNo, no, I'll cut myself off,\n\"to begin learning again?\"\nSandra Trazzare, no!\nDid I pronounce that right?\nThank you, Sandra.\nNo, Richard Feynman, the\ngreat Richard Feynman,\ntaught himself to draw later in life.\nHe was also really into flotation tanks.\nDid you know that?\nYeah, he was also into bongo drumming\nnaked on the roof at Caltech.\nRichard Feynman, you\nknow, did so many things\nthat would get most people fired nowadays.\nHe's just lucky he was alive when he was.\nYou can absolutely learn\nat 66 and way beyond.\nThere's an amazing study\nfrom Rusty Gage's lab at the\nSalk Institute years ago,\nshowing that even people\nwho are very late in life,\nterminally ill in fact,\nare still producing new neurons\nin the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.\nThese people that were gracious enough\nto allow researchers to\ninject them with dyes\nthat would label these neurons\nfor analysis postmortem, after they died.\nAbsolutely you can learn.\nWhat's harder is focus.\nOftentimes what's harder is sleep as well,\nbut the same mechanisms apply.\nThere's no evidence whatsoever\nthat neuroplasticity\ndisappears at any stage\ndespite what Hubel and\nWiesel told the BBC.\n\"How do you tackle\nreading research papers?\nDo you have a specific strategy?\"\nAnne Hun, yes I do.\nI do. I take notes on everything.\nI try and so I there's four\nquestions that we teach students\nand that I think that I use.\nThe first one is:\n\"What's the question they're asking,\nmajor and more specific?\"\nSecond is: \"What did they do?\nWhat are they, like\nmethods-wise, what did they do?\"\nYou don't have to know all\nthe details in the methods\nnecessarily, but be\nversed in those methods,\nbut you have to kind of understand like,\nare they looking at mice?\nAre they looking at humans?\nIs this a, you know, did they have people\nin two different conditions or just one?\nYou have to understand what did they do,\nthen you ask, \"What did they find?\"\nAnd then the last question\nis the most important one\nand you should write down\nthe answer to this is:\n\"What did they conclude?\"\nAnd then you look back\nat the first question\nand you go,\n\"Did they actually answer that question,\nor is it something unrelated?\"\nAnd those four questions\nare essentially the way\nthat I parse each paper.\nLearning to parse papers\nis tricky for the podcast.\nI use the telephone.\nI call people and I badger\nthem and I ask them, you know,\n\"Like who's doing the really\ngood work in this area?\"\nAnd I spend a lot of hours doing it.\nAnd then the best way to remember science\nis to tell someone about it.\nSo before each podcast I'll\ncall someone and be like,\n\"Hey, did you know\nthat they used to throw\nkids in the river?\"\nAfter, I do this, and my\nsister, my poor sister,\nand she's like, \"Yeah.\"\nMy sister, by the way,\ndoes not watch the podcast.\nI, she's a therapist.\nAnd she's like,\n\"Hey, I learned this amazing\nbreathing technique.\"\nI was like,\n\"Oh yeah, really? Tell me about it.\"\nAnd it's like, someone else is there.\nI'm like, \"You know, I have a podcast.\"\nShe's like, \"I don't like your podcast.\"\nYou know, it's older\nsister, it's older sister.\nIt's, she's not lying.\n\"What is your favorite\nsauce, condiment, seasoning?\nSauce.\nThere's one in every audience.\nI like the spicy stuff.\nWe've been fermenting\nour own food at home.\nIt's kind of cool.\nYou put the cabbage and the stuff\nin the little ceramic thing outside,\nand then it, it goes\n[popping]\nIt makes this amazing sound.\nAnd then you can like\nmake your own sauerkraut and you know,\nwith peppers and like\nfermenting that stuff,\nit's really good.\nOkay.\nThey're telling me one more\nquestion so we'll do two.\n\"What's most important from your ADH, ah.\"\nGabriel, a lot of questions about ADHD,\nfor people on medication\nor not on medication,\nso I'll answer both.\nFor people on medication,\nI think work with somebody really good\nwho's willing to work with you\nto allow you to find that\nminimal effective dose,\nand also timing that dose.\nOne of the key things that we know now\nis that from that waking\nup point in your morning\nuntil about eight or nine hours later,\nwe've sort of named that\nphase one of the day\nfor lack of a better naming protocol.\nThe systems that release cortisol,\ndopamine, and epinephrine,\nare essentially more\neffective at producing those\nthan they are in the\nlater periods of the day.\nWhich makes sense if you think about\nthe way that the autonomic\nnervous system works, et cetera.\nSo there's an important question\nthat I can't answer for you,\nbut you can answer for you,\nwhich is if you're using\nRitalin, Adderall, Vyvanse,\nthese things that enhance\ndopaminergic transmission,\nModafinil, Armodafinil, by the way,\nfor the people in the audience like me,\nwho didn't go to college when\nthese things were all in use,\nthe numbers of people\nthat use these compounds,\non and off prescription, is astronomical.\nIt's incredible.\nI didn't realize it.\nI think something like\n80% of college students\nuse these at some point.\nIncredible, 'cause they put you\ninto a narrow aperture\ntunnel of concentration.\nSo you want to, with a\nphysician's support of course,\nto help, get permission or not,\nto figure out what time of\nday to take your medication.\nNow for people who are not on medication,\nI'll just go right back\nto what I said earlier,\nwhich is that you can train focus,\nbut it feels terrible to train it.\nIt is hard.\nAgain there are these large\nscale studies in China\nand elsewhere of people\nliterally teaching themselves,\nand yes, they blink, although less often,\nto focus their vision on a narrow aperture\nand to really battle\nthrough that agitation,\nstress, and learn how to keep their focus.\nNow focus will drift, right?\nFocus is not a constant; focus will drift,\nand you pop out of focused states\nand then refocus, and\npop out, and refocus.\nThat's something that you can train up.\nI've heard from many people\nwho have managed to train\nthemselves off medication\nor to lower doses of medication,\nand look, some people can't do that.\nThey absolutely have to maintain\ntheir standard medication protocols.\nThis is a larger discussion, obviously,\nas it relates to ADHD.\nWe're going to do another episode on ADHD\nbecause the data are\ncoming out so so fast.\n\"What future episodes\nare in the pipeline?\"\nDavid Nguyen. Okay, thank\nyou for that question.\nWe have one on grief.\nWe have an amazing episode with\na guy from the Rockefeller University\non the, this is,\nam I allowed to say it's going\nto be my favorite episode?\nI love all the guests,\nbut this episode just blew me away.\nIt's on the relationship\nbetween language,\nspeech, dance, and music.\nAnd I have no musical talent\nand I'm not a very good dancer.\nSo that's being generous.\nAmazing interplay between those things,\nexercise in the brain, OCD,\nbulimia, binge-eating disorder,\nPeter Attia's coming on.\nHe'll teach us about everything\nmedicine, and longevity.\nAnd I'm kind of blanking at the moment.\nDavid Anderson from Caltech\non aggression and emotional states.\nAmazing.\nAnd then there are a number of people,\nLisa Feldman Barrett, or Barrett Feldman.\nI always get it backwards.\nSorry, Lisa, on emotions in the brain.\nAnd really we do take suggestions\nabout who to bring on the\npodcast very seriously.\nWhat we're mostly looking for\nare the people that no one else has heard,\nthat people haven't heard of,\nwho are not going on podcasts every week\nand that people should\nabsolutely hear from.\nAnd then I will tell you,\nthey're going to kill me for saying this,\nbut I'm going to do it anyway,\nwe have some short series coming up\nwith expert professionals.\nI'm going to do a short series on trauma.\nAnd my hope for this series\nis that you'll actually get to\nsee an exquisitely\nskilled trauma therapist,\ntake someone through, excuse me,\nI seem so excited I'm spitting\non the audience, excuse me.\nSo it, to take someone\nthrough actual trauma therapy.\nThis isn't staged.\nThis is somebody who's actually\nin a point of near\nsuicidal grief and trauma,\ntaking them through it in\nthe course of the podcast,\nas people can see what this\nprocess actually entails.\nThat's a very meaningful project to me\nfor a number of reasons\nso we're really excited about that.\nAnd you know, to be\nhonest, I feel like there's\njust such a treasure trove\nof information out there\nI just want to grab it all,\nand tell you all about it,\nuntil, I always say, \"If nothing\nelse, I'll cure insomnia.\"\nSo, the, yeah.\n[audience applauding vigorously]\nThank you. Appreciate it.\n[applause continuing]\nThank you so much for your time.\nI really appreciate everyone\ncoming out on a weekday\nand I'd be remiss if I didn't say,\nThank you for your interest in science.\n[audience cheering and applauding]\n[upbeat music playing]"
