    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine recently the hubman Lab podcast\nhosted a live event at the ICC theater\nin Sydney Australia the event was called\nthe brain body contract and featured a\nlecture followed by a question and\nanswer session with the audience we\nwanted to make the question and answer\nsession available to every one\nregardless if you could attend I also\nwould like to thank the sponsors for the\nevent they are eight sleep and ag1 eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity now I've spoken many times\nbefore on this podcast about the fact\nthat sleep is the critical foundation\nfor mental health physical health and\nperformance now one of the key things to\ngetting the best possible night sleep is\nto control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment and that's because\nin order to fall and stay deeply asleep\nyour body temperature actually needs to\ndrop by about 1 to 3° and in order order\nto wake up feeling refreshed and alert\nyour body temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmattress covers make it extremely easy\nto control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment and thereby to\ncontrol your core body temperature so\nthat you fall and stay deeply asleep and\nwake up feeling your absolute best I've\nbeen sleeping on an eights Sleep\nmattress cover for about 3 years now and\nit has completely transformed the\nquality of my sleep for the better eight\nsleep recently launched their newest\ngeneration of pod cover the Pod 4 ultra\nthe Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and\nheating capacity higher Fidelity sleep\ntracking technology and the Pod 4 cover\nhas snoring detection that will\nautomatically lift your head a few\ndegrees to improve airflow and stop your\nsnoring if you'd like to try an eights\nSleep mattress cover you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $350 off their pod 4\nultra eight sleep currently ships to the\nUSA Canada UK select countries in the EU\nand Australia again that's 8sleep.com\nhuberman the other live event sponsor\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens and other\ncritical micronutrients I've been taking\nag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted\nthat they decided to sponsor the live\nevent I started taking ag1 and I still\ntake ag1 once or twice a day because it\ngives me vitamins and minerals that I\nmight not be getting enough of from\nWhole Foods that I eat as well as\nadaptogens and micronutrients those\nadaptogens and micronutrients are really\ncritical because even though I strive to\neat most of my foods from unprocessed or\nminimally processed Whole Foods it's\nit's often hard to do so especially when\nI'm traveling and especially when I'm\nbusy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in\nthe morning and often times also again\nin the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring\nthat I'm getting everything I need I'm\ncovering all of my foundational\nnutritional needs and I like so many\nother people that take ag1 regularly\njust report feeling better and that\nshouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother other so while certain\nsupplements are really directed towards\none specific outcome like sleeping\nbetter or being more alert ag1 really is\nfoundational nutritional support it's\nreally designed to support all of the\nsystems of your brain and body that\nrelate to mental health and physical\nhealth if you'd like to try ag1 you can\ngo to drink a1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer they'll give you five free\ntravel packs with your order plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink a1.com huberman\nand now for the live event at the ICC\ntheater in Sydney\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nAustralia does having an afternoon sleep\naffect your quality of sleep at night um\ngreat question I can keep this one\npretty brief um we just recorded a six\nepisode series that will be aired later\nthis year uh with the one and only\nMighty Matt Walker who wrote The\nMarvelous book why we sleep and uh we\nwent into this topic in depth the\nbusiness of naps is the following keep\nthem shorter than 90 minutes so you\ndon't disrupt your nighttime sleep don't\ndo them at all if it disrupts your\nnighttime sleep so if you're somebody\nthat for whom even 10 minutes of napping\ndisrupts your nighttime sleep don't do\nthat\nif you're somebody who wakes up from\nnaps feeling groggy that's what's called\nSleep inertia this is what gave rise to\nthe ever famous napino of having some\ncoffee and then taking a nap or an\nespresso and then taking a nap again I\nget obsessed with gnomen clature why\ndidn't they call it a Espress espresso\nnap I don't know\nnaps are wonderful if they're shorter\nthan 90 minutes don't interfere with\nnighttime sleep but I in particular am a\nbig fan of as many of you know this\nbusiness of non-sleep deep rest of\nputting the body into what body still\nmind awake and we know based on several\nstudies from the University of\nCopenhagen that that actually\nreplenishes levels of dopamine in\ncertain key areas of the brain that\nrestore mental and physical\nVigor and do not disrupt nighttime sleep\nbut rather enhance one's ability to fall\nand stay asleep or to fall back asleep\nso not only are these states of body\nstill mind\nawake very beneficial it seems or I\nshould say perhaps for creativity\nbecause that was all anak data but we\nknow from real data from laboratory data\non many subjects peer-reviewed Etc that\nbody still mind alert is actually an\neffective means to improve one's sleep\nand perhaps even make up for sleep that\none has lost so I encourage you if\nyou're a napper great and if you have\nchallenges with sleep in any way that\nyou think might be related to your\nnapping activity that you consider short\n10minute or maybe 20 minute non-sleep\ndeep breast protocols by the way they're\ncompletely zero cost and very soon we\nwill be releasing to our YouTube clips\nChannel a 10minute 20 minute and 30\nminute non-sleep deep rest protocol that\nI've narrated if you don't like my voice\nwe can there are many out there of more\npleasant voices but um what might be of\nparticular interest to you is that the\nvisual is of um the beautiful sunrise\nover Sydney so you know it'll bring you\nhome as well um sunrises here absolutely\nspectacular do you believe in the\nplacebo effect absolutely and there's\nprobably a joke there but I can't come\nup with it on the Fly um how would I\nknow if it's real that um something like\nthat um so the placebo effect is real um\nour belief about what we've taken or\nwhat is happening to us has a powerful\neffect on our physiology it's not purely\npsychological the whole business of\npsychosomatic even that word is starting\nto fall away as we start to understand\nthat our beliefs have a powerful effect\non what happens to us physiologically so\nmuch so that for instance my colleague\nAli\nCrum a tenar professor at Stanford's\nDepartment of psychology who's been a\nguest on the podcast who studies\nmindsets has done beautiful experiments\non stress showing that if you watch a\nshort video about stress and you learn\nall the terrible things that stress can\ndo to your cognition your sleep and your\nwell-being well that indeed that happens\nand that if you watch a short video\nabout how stress can be performance-\nenhancing by sharpening your mental\nacuity your access to\nparticular memory stores Etc that indeed\nthat happens so-called belief effects\nwhy belief effects not Placebo effects\nwell Placebo effects tend to be more\nGeneral belief effects tend to be around\nspecific types of information but the\nplacebo effect has recently been shown\nto extend to a dose dependent placebo\neffect one of the more remarkable papers\nI think published in the last few years\nmost people are unaware of I talked\nabout this in a journal Club episode of\nThe hubman Lab podcast with the one and\nonly Peter\nAtia described a paper where people took\neither zero I believe it was\n.25 milligrams half a milligram or a\ngram of nicotine which is known to be a\ncognitive enhancer please don't smoke\ndip Huff or snuff nicotine that's erous\nin those forms but and taking nicotine\ncan increase blood pressure Vasa\nconstriction Etc but nicotine is a\ncognitive enhancer it is a cognitive\nenhancer and I can't help but tell you\none story about this before I get back\nto placebo effect don't worry I always\nmake my way\nback you can see why living with me as a\nchild was so challenging\num nicotine I was told by a very very\nfamous Nobel laurate member M of the\nNeuroscience Community because I visited\nhis office I won't tell you who it is at\nColumbia University I met with him and\nhe was telling me about what he studies\nbut I noed he chewed no fewer than six\npieces of Nicorette during the course of\nthat conversation and I had to just stop\nhim at one point and say why are you\nconsuming all this nicotine and he said\nwell it's what's going to allow me to\nStave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's of\ncourse and I don't want to smoke and I\nsaid really and he said yeah there's\nsome evidence that keeping levels of\nneuromodulators like dopamine\nacetylcholine elevated despite the\nincreases in blood pressure that are\ncaused by consuming nicotine May indeed\noffset Parkinson's and Alzheimer's I'm\nnot telling you this as a clinical trial\nI'm telling you this as anic data he is\na Nobel Prize winner he's still very\nvery sharp in his 80s the point here is\nthat in a study of nicotine and\ncognition where people's cognition is\nindeed enhanced by nicotine everybody\nknows that and agrees upon that people\nwho were told they had a higher dose of\nnicotine performed better in this\ncognitive task when in fact they\nconsumed\nzero and people who performed\nmoderately who were then told that they\nhad consumed a higher dose of nicotine\nperformed better than those that simply\nconsumed the moderate dose and were told\nthey had a moderate dose in other words\neveryone gets the same dose either zero\nor moderate but depending on what you're\ntold your performance changes\naccordingly and that's cool but what's\nreally cool about the study is they\nactually recorded from brain centers of\nthese individuals and the levels of\nactivity in particular areas of the\nbrain that are relevant for cognition\nchanged according to what the people\nbelieve so there you go placebo effect\nis changing neural activity it's not all\njust through what you think is happening\nwhat you think is happening is the\nreflection of neural activity and then\nyou go well of course but I think it's\nan important study so I believe in the\nplacebo effect and it is dose dependent\nand that raises all sorts of scary\nconcerns about the placebo effect but\nit's also pretty darn cool because what\nit means is that our belief system\nincluding our understanding of the\nmechanisms that are likely driving\ncertain effects of drugs or protocols or\nwhat have you is going to play a\npowerful role in whether or not we get\nthe effect that we want and perhaps\nthat's the most important thing provided\nthat you're going about it\nsafely how do I enter the rest and\ndigest State and exit my constant fight\nORF flight State well the fastest way is\ngoing to be physiological size probably\nrepeated two or three times in a row if\nyou don't experience that the first time\nthe second would be to combine that with\npanoramic Vision I must say and I don't\nwant to sound like a like a repeating\nrecord here but there are certain things\nthat if we're not doing on a regular\nbasis our nervous system is just going\nto idle at a higher let's just call it\nautonomic RPM which is not you know real\nscience language but if you've ever felt\nkind of wired and tired from lack of\nsleep you know what this is about the\nkey thing is to get enough sleep each\nnight you know so much so that I think\nwe can safely say that stress is not bad\nfor us provided you sleep well at night\nnow the challenge is for most people\nincluding myself if you stress a lot\nsleep doesn't come easily or you wake\nfrom sleep in the middle of the night\nand here again is where zero cost\nbehavioral protocols are truly in my\nopinion unless there's some dire\nclinical\nneed the most effective and best\npractice and this non-sleep deep rest\nwhich by the way is indeed a renaming or\na partial renaming of Yoga Nidra which\nstands for yoga sleep and again I have\ntremendous reverence for the yogic\nTraditions it's just that I had to make\na decision a few years ago when I'd been\nintroduced to Yoga Nidra in 2015 I was\ndown at a trauma Treatment Center an\naddiction treatment Center in Florida\nrun by a friend of mine essentially\nobserving what they were doing with\nthese addicts That Couldn't recover no\nmatter what their effort and they were\nable to recover to get sober and stay\nsober and people were getting over other\nsorts of traumas through the use of many\nProtocols of course talk therapy Etc but\nthey would start their day with 30\nminutes to an hour of yoga NRA and I\nthought what's Yoga Nidra learned its\nyoga sleep you lie down you do a\nself-directed relaxation it also\ninvolves intentions Etc and I thought\nthis is really powerful and I spent a\nlot of time in my laboratory working on\nit and understanding it and there are\nother studies as well that now explain\nhow these states of keeping the Mind\nactive while the body is still as a\nself-directed practice is immensely\npowerful for a number of reasons and the\nreason I decide to call it non-sleep\ndeep rest\nnsdr was not to rob it of the official\nname of yoganidra but because\nunfortunately\nunfortunately names like yoganidra\nor proprietary names or thing when we\nname protocols after\npeople it acts as a separator it often\ndeters people from trying things because\nit sounds esoteric so I went with a\ndescription of the\nthing that relates to what the thing is\nsupposed to do non-sleep deep rest or\nwhat it's all about so um you know I\nactively avoided calling it huberman\nbreathing um or something like that\nbecause that's not my interest my\ninterest is in people using these tools\nand I have taken some heat for that one\num I'm not interested it was not an\nattempt to appropriate something it was\nreally an attempt to just try and\ndistribute valuable tools because I see\na lot of suffering and it seems like a\nuseful thing to do so I would encourage\nanyone that feels like they enter a\nstressed State too much to learn\nself-directed relaxation first and\nforemost so do nsdr anywhere from three\nto five times a week 10 minutes a day as\na zero cost tool as a way to be able to\nbetter access better sleep at night and\nthen if the figh ORF flight State\npersists then of course things like\nphysiological SI Etc um should be\nincorporated and then of course of\ncourse of course I believe in modern\nmedicine there are excellent\npharmaceutical tools prescription drugs\nthat can be used for that but of course\nthere's the intermediate stuff things\nlike theanine and magnesium that you\nknow for all the world can be useful in\nsome context but they're not the be all\nend all you know as much as I might\nreference supplements on the podcast\nfrom time to time I don't think they're\nthe place to start I think one should\nalways use behavioral tools first and\nI've said this many times before um but\nI think it's worth saying again our\nmuscles need rest days from the gym in\norder to grow back stronger yes\ndefinitely true um is the brain designed\nto be consistently learning and\ndeveloping or does does it need periods\nof rest from consuming new information\nor is the rest when we sleep great\nquestions thank you Timothy um yes\nindeed our\nmuscles get stronger grow after a proper\nstimulus is applied to them in the time\nafter we provide that stimulus which\ntypically is resistance but since not\neveryone's interested in that it's also\nthe case that an endurance\nadaptation\noccurs after we embark on the run the\nhike the swim Etc there's something kind\nof interesting and I just want to take a\nmoment and just um mention that there's\nsomething kind of interesting about\nresistance training is that the one form\nof training that because of the enhanced\nblood flow to the muscles while we do it\ngives us a window into what the\nadaptation might look\nlike once it occurs if we allow proper\nrest whereas with endurance training\nit's very different right you go further\nand or you run up a hill until your legs\nburn and you want to vomit up a and then\nthe next time you do it you don't feel\nquite as bad right the adaptation occurs\nof course in a very similar way to\nresistance training different mechanisms\nbut there's a delay and adaptation you\nget better it's just that with\nresistance training you can kind of\nsense the change before the change\noccurs because of the enhanced blood\nflow of the muscles with endurance\ntraining you sense the limit of your\nability and then you exceed that limit\nsubsequently now in terms of cognitive\nlearning the same thing is basically\ntrue if you want to get really technical\nabout it the computational biology the\nmodeling of this says that if you want\nto learn something probably setting the\ndifficulty of what you're trying to\nlearn to about 85% correct trials 15%\nerror trials is probably ideal what does\nthat mean it means if you're trying to\nlearn a new piano piece you know or\nyou're trying to teach that to a child\nif they're not starting from scratch let\nthem play something that they know\npretty well and then introduce a small\npercentage maybe 10 to 15 maybe 20% you\ndon't have to be exact about this of\nNovel material that's hard for them to\nlearn but yes it is the focused\ndeliberate attempt to learn something\nthat creates that sense of underlying\nagitation that is the trigger the\nstimulus for\nneuroplasticity this makes sense if you\ncould complete something if you could do\nsomething a scale on of Music a physical\ntask speaking a new language if you\ncould do that why would your nervous\nsystem ever change and how does your\nnervous system know if it's supposed to\nchange right your nervous system doesn't\nknow successful trial versus failure\ntrial right I've tried many times to\nlearn other languages and I'm you know\nmodestly terrible at Spanish but if I\nwere to try and get better my nervous\nsystem doesn't know when I'm failing has\nno idea what it knows is the release of\ncertain neurom\nmodulators namely adrenaline and\nnorepinephrine and a few others as well\nthat are associated with the underlying\nagitation of like I'm failing at this\nI'm not able to remember that Spanish\nclass because I didn't attend in high\nschool and this is really difficult and\nthat agitation the frustration is the\nstimulus but when we say frustration\nit's the neurochemicals that when they\nbathe the surrounding neurons those\nneurons go oh something needs to change\nfor next time and lo and behold the\nstimulus for neuroplasticity has\noccurred but the actual rewiring of the\nneurons either the Improvement or the\nreduction in the strength of synapsis of\nconnections between neurons and in rare\ninstances the addition of new neurons\nfor neuroplasticity occurs yes when we\nsleep in states of deep rest or\nnon-sleep deep rest although there's\nless data to support that but the actual\nrewiring occurs away from the stimulus\nso there's really two important\nprinciples here one is that agitation\nand stress and the neurochemicals that\nunderly agitation and stress that is the\nstimulus for Learning and goodness do I\nwish they had taught me that in school I\nmean they taught me all sorts of things\nin school but they didn't teach me that\nthey didn't teach me the physiological\nside Lord knows I would have done better\nin life if I had those tools instead\nthey told me look you know if you drive\ndrunk you could die that was good\ninformation but they didn't tell us\nabout all the other stuff so I wish they\ntold us about the stimulus and rest\nthing and somehow they have permission\nto talk about the rest all right what's\nmy take on\nhallucinations goodness gracious my take\non\nhallucinations is um I've taken them um\nclearly um well here's the the real\nstory on Hallin first of all um I'm I'm\nvery open about most everything I've\ndone you know um trying to keep context\nappropriate but um I I had the\nunfortunate experience of taking LSD and\nSil sibin when I was all too young and\nthose were bad experiences some of them\nwere bad in the moment some of them were\nbad after the moment it is something I\ndo not recommend and I'm not saying that\nto be politically correct I'm not saying\nthat because it's true the reality is\nthat being a child an adolescent or a\nteenager is a psychedelic\nexperience and your brain is still\nwiring up in all sorts of interesting\nways and everything seems chaotic and\neven if you're one of those rare kids\nthat seems to have everything roded up\nappropriately you don't want to throw\nmassive amounts of neuromodulators in\nthere haphazardly and start tampering\nwith the wiring that's my deep belief\nokay you that's my deep\nbelief however\nit does appear that at least for adults\nwho are not suffering from particular\npsychiatric challenges namely forms of\npsychosis right this is real I mean one\nin 100 people experiences schizophrenic\nsymptoms Etc it's a very high number if\nyou think about it um certain forms of\nbipolar depression that the clinical\ntrials on psychedelics and here I'm\nassuming when you say hallucinogens\nyou're referring to psychedelics are\nvery very compelling the psychiatric\nCommunity is now being forced to look at\nthese data because the data are very\ncompelling what do we know about these\ndata and yes I've participated in two\nsuch clinical trials one on high do\npsilocybin high dose meaning more than\ntwo grams taken twice by the way this is\nwith the support of medically trained\ntherapists and the use of psychedelics\nsuch as psilocybin mostly psilocybin not\nso much LSD do you know why most of the\ntrials are on psilocybin and not LSD I\ndo but I'm curious if you know it's not\nto what's that LSD is too long that's\nright that people need to go\nhome people need to go home the\ntechnicians need to go and LSD is a long\nride it's a long ride so the the thing\nabout cybin is that the you know the\nsort of Journey the trip is you know\nsomewhere on the order of anywhere from\nyou know 3 to 7 hours which can fit into\na reason able work day for a technician\nclinician um and LSD can be many many\nhours longer the kind of um Mount\nEverest of psychedelics which is under\ninvestigation by a colleague of mine at\nStanford School of Medicine Nolan\nWilliams is ibigan iboga which is 22\nhours long it has cardiac effects this\nis not something to to get Cavalier with\nthis is something only to be done in a\nclinical context with medical experts\nthere and iboga is very interesting from\nwhat I'm told I have not participated in\niboga trial iboga allows for or induces\na state in which you do not hallucinate\nat all with eyes open but the moment you\ngo eyes closed you get a\nhighresolution\naccurate picture of Prior events in your\nlife but you have agency you have\nvolition inside of those pictures and\nyou're able to change your behavior and\nresculpt your Rel relationship to those\nexperiences like wow and the state of\nKentucky in California recently excuse\nme the state of Kentucky in the United\nStates thank goodness Kentucky isn't\ninside of California that would be civil\nwar the state of Kentucky recently took\nthe $40 million settlement from the\nopioid thing right you've all heard\nabout that the opioid crisis and applied\nthat money to iboga trials so this stuff\nis happening this stuff is really\nhappening now in the US in any event\npsilocybin these two\nsessions medically supported two\nsessions um has been shown to be pretty\neffective in the treatment of major\ndepression not completely effective\nsometimes there's adverse outcomes but\nfar more effective than the other\npharmaceutical treatments that it's been\ncompared to so that's interesting and\npsilocybin is serotonin if you look at\nthe structure of psilocybin and it looks\nlike serotonin so we're talking about is\na massive dose of\nSerotonin and psilocybin appears to bind\nnear selectively to a particular\nserotonin receptor and the outcome seems\nto be enhanced or more more broad\nconnectivity between brain areas that\nnormally are not communicating with one\nanother probably not the growth of new\nconnections but the let's say the\nunveiling of the ability for certain\nbrain areas to communicate with with one\nanother whereas they couldn't prior\ndifferent ways of thinking about the\nsame problems which is logically sound\nif you think about ways to deal with\ndepression depression is characterized\nby a number of things of course but one\nof the Hallmark features of depression\nin addition to sleep challenges is a\nlack of positive anticipation of the\nfuture and it does seem that these macro\ndo cocin trials are helpful for that\nturns out that the micro doing of\npsilocybin has not been shown to be\nTerri effective which is not to say it\nisn't but the trials don't support that\nalthough there aren't many Trials of\nthat yet so it appears you know if you\nhad to pick between micro and macro\ndosing go\nmacro um but be careful um go be careful\nand and set in setting is important\nsafety is important and certainly not\nfor children and as long as and or\nadolescence or teenagers I really again\nwant to want to reemphasize that the the\nother thing is as long as we're talking\npsychedelics and hallucinogens we should\nprobably just touch on MDMA for a moment\nfirst of all MDMA ecstasy um has a\nnumber of challenges or potential\nproblems that need to be highlighted\nfirst of all um contaminants you know we\nhave a fentanyl crisis in the US so\ncontaminants so Purity is essential\nsecond of all it is methylene dioxy\nmethampetamine\nand the methamphetamine part often gets\npeople thinking like whoa it seems\nhowever that the inclusion of the\nmethylene dioxy component increases\nserotonin dramatically and it is the\nincrease in\nserotonin perhaps or at least it's now\nthought in addition to the increase in\ndopamine caused by the methampetamine\ncomponent combined that provides some\nsort of neuroprotective effect the early\nreports that MDMA ecstasy is neurotoxic\nquote unquote puts holes in your\nbrain was flawed by and indeed that\npaper was retracted the researchers did\nthat study in Earnest but then later\ndiscovered that when they reached for\nthe MDMA on the Shelf they actually\ngrabbed the\nmethamphetamine but the news agencies\ndidn't report that retraction now our\nbest evidence that\nMDMA taken in the appropriate clinically\nsupported context can act as an\nempathogen can help people develop\nempathy for themselves and help relieve\ntrauma and indeed the clinical trials\nshow that at the proper dosing and the\nproper frequency with the proper support\nthere's up to 60% and as high as 67%\nremission of PTSD\nremarkable with support okay not just\ntaking Molly and like dancing in the\ndesert we're talking about we're talking\nabout in the eye mask we're talking\nabout going inward we're talking about\nrelaying your experience we're talking\nabout talking about the challenging\nexperience or experiences with someone\nwho's qualified to help you deal with\nall of that Etc and someone to drive you\nhome because you feel like a puddle\nafterwards talking about all of that\nwe're not talking about eye gazing with\nyour partner telling them how much you\nlove them you're talking about empathy\nfor self love for self which is a\nconcept that frankly I've often\nstruggled with I thought you know people\nwould say you got to love yourself I'm\nlike what is that like what is that I\nlove my Bulldog I love my friends I love\ncuttlefish but like what is that and I\nthink through the use of MDMA you can\nthere seems to be this ability to\ndevelop imp pathogenic states to\nyourself but of course the reason for\nthe clinical trials insisting that\npeople stay in the IM askk and\ncommunicate their experience maybe\npopping out of it every once in a while\nand talking with somebody in a trusted\nsort a trusted person in a way that can\nbe helpful towards dealing with the\ntrauma is that the problem with having\nthat much serotonin and that much\ndopamine in your system is that you can\nbecome empathic toward anything so we've\nall known people that take MDMA listen\nto a particular soundtrack and they're\nlike I'm going to become a musician I\nlove music and again I'm not\nrecommending anyone do MDMA but\nin recent years I've really changed my\nstance on psychedelics 5 years ago 10\nyears ago I never would have had this\ndiscussion certainly not with a\nmicrophone in front of my face anything\nbeing recorded would have worried about\nlosing my job at Stanford or elsewhere\nbut we now have many Laboratories at\nStanford and elsewhere that are doing\nwork that is federally funded on these\ncompounds and if you think about these\ncompounds while they have been used\nrecreationally are simply ways to adjust\nlevels of neuromodulators in the brain\nserotonin dopamine Etc that's really all\nthey are although they do it very\npotently and therefore caution needs to\nbe\napplied and as long as we're on that\ntopic I should mention that ketamine\neveryone's excited about ketamine when I\nwas growing up I was taught that there's\na compound that's really dangerous it's\ncalled PCP ven cycline they are the same\ncompound they don't tell you this\nketamine and PCP same thing and I\nlearned about PCP as the compound that\nwas going to make criminals like punch\nlight poles and beat up 12 cops and yeah\nI watched too much chips when I was\ngrowing up for those of you old old\nenough to remember is like Ponch and\nJohn they the motorcycles with the\nshorts my sister watched it too but for\ncompletely different reasons so PCP was\nlike this demonized drug but ketamine\nand all this stuff about ketamine is now\nlegal in the US I don't know its status\nhere in Sydney so I'll see if I get\narrested on the way out but you know\nketamine is potentially addictive people\ntalk about the khole ETC weird name by\nthe way um the whole business with\nketamine is again it's a potent MDMA n\nmethylaspartate blocker which blocks\nneuroplasticity in the short term\nexpands it in the long term so the way\nto think about these compounds these\ndrugs is by way of their mechanism and\nso it should be no surprise that they're\nable to induce neuroplasticity but the\ngoal is not plasticity this is very very\nimportant the goal goal is not\nplasticity the goal is plasticity\ndirected toward a particular positive\noutcome anytime you have plasticity you\nhave the potential for maladaptive\nplasticity as well and so that's an\nadditional cautionary note as I often\nsay on the podcast I don't say that just\nto protect me although I am a little bit\nworried now about what I just said over\nthe last five minutes I'm say that to\nprotect you next question before I get\nmyself in trouble what about\nwhat DMT\nyeah dimethyl trip to me the yeah it\nleads to less uh to um lower threshold\nfor impulsivity like screaming out what\nabout\nDMT just kidding I don't sorry um so I'm\njust joking I'm just joking you seem\nlike you could take it so I got yeah so\num so I've never done DMT but I've heard\nit's a highspeed freight train into your\nConsciousness behind the circuit board\nand Back Again\num so there are a few great studies on\nDMT in iasa just as long as we're\nexpanding into the the full trip down to\nthe Jungle um and the the data are\ninteresting it's it's harder to\nknow what's going on in these very short\ntrip massive neuromodulator release um\nuh type drug scenarios um Robin Card\nHarris at the University of California\nSan Francisco is somebody who's looking\nat DMT um more extensively and and I I\ndon't want to avoid giving you an answer\nbut I I do want to avoid giving you a\nwrong answer that's not informed one\nthing I'll say and this is just rarely\ndo I plug anything related to the\npodcast but we we are actually providing\nsome support to Robin and others\nlaboratory for the study of things like\nDMT one of the things that we do at the\npodcast and this is not a request for\nanything we do take a significant\nportion of the proceeds from our premium\nchannel and we fund studies of exciting\nthings like DMT we're supporting Robin's\nlab this coming year I've pulled\ntogether some other donors to provide\nsupport for all human studies no animal\nstudies and the goal is really to fill\nin important blanks like the study of\nDMT um as well as other things we're\nwe're currently funding the um Eating\nDisorders laboratory at the at Columbia\nUniversity Eating Disorders by the way\num anorexia nervosa in particular the\nmost deadly of all psychiatric disorders\na really um tragic challenge there um so\nI just mentioned that getting funding\nfor science on really um kind of Next\nLevel stuff is hard for reasons that are\nwould take up the whole night so that's\none thing that I'm really trying to do\nin the next few years and again this is\nnot a request but to you know pull\ntogether donors and get them to give\nmoney to Laboratories to do the kind of\nstuff that's going to feed back to the\ngeneral public very quickly because I\nthink we're all getting a little tired\nof the like okay Mouse study which are\ngreat you know but in 10 years this\nmight lead to a blank for Alzheimer's or\nblank for autism I think we're all\ngetting a little tired of that narrative\nso we're trying to accelerate the\nprocess okay the yeah thank you the um\nand it's not a sole effort it's just I\ndo happen to know a lot about the way\nthat funding me mechanisms can get a\nlittle bit clogged and so just trying to\nyou know clear some of those clogs um\nthe brain and gut axis is this a thing\nit is most definitely a thing so I think\none of the more exciting areas is the\nso-called gut brain axis we all now here\nabout the gut microbiome I must say down\nhere y'all are really evolved in this\nDimension the other day I noticed\nprobably from jet lag and travel and I\ndon't know maybe I swam in some stuff\nthat had too much chlorine or something\nI was getting like some little like skin\nthing on my face I was like all right\nI'll go go get some triple antibiotic\nointment like I do back home clean it up\nbecause I forgot mine so I go to the\npharmacy here what you call the chemist\nI go to the pharmacy\nand and\nthe guy behind the counter says well you\ndon't first of all you can't get triple\nantibiotic ointment here you need a\nprescription like all right well this is\ngoing to get tricky now I got to forge a\nprescription and and I'm just kidding\ndon't do that don't do that um and he\nsays but you know have you considered\nwhether or not maybe your skin\nmicrobiome is struggling because of the\nlack of sleep the jetl and maybe you\nwere exposed to some chlorine or\nsomething I thought you know that's a\nlogical way to think about it cuz cuz we\njust did an episode on oral health where\nI'm telling everybody hey like avoid\nthese like high alcohol astringent\nmouthwashes that kill your oral\nmicrobiome because all the dentists and\nperiodontists are telling me yeah\nthey'll make your breath fresh but\nactually it's Wrecking your gut\nmicrobiome and it's bad for so I take\nthe probiotic you guys have amazing\nprobiotics here and in a day boom it's\ndone now I didn't do a control clinical\ntrial I don't know whether or not that\nwas really what did it but it's an\ninteresting idea this I we know for\ninstance that we have a distinct\nmicrobiome niches different bacteria\nthat live in our nasal passages on the\nsurface of our eyes on the surface of\nour skin in the urethra in essentially\nevery orifice mucus membrane but\neverywhere in and around our body and\nthat these little\nmicrobiota are provided they are\nsupported they do many things but among\nthem the gut microbiome which of course\nstart in the mouth as the oral health\nepisode um describes with a lot of\nprotocols as well the the gut\nmicrobiome when it's well supported\ncreates certain fatty acids that are the\nprecursors or catalysts for the\nproduction of certain neurotransmitters\nin the brain and it is now oh so clear\nthat enhancing the diversity of Flora of\nmicrobiota in the gut and\nmouth is great for the nervous system so\nmuch so that some of the studies on on\nrelief from certain neuros psychiatric\nconditions are being achieved through\nand I know it's not pleasant but\nmicrobiota transfer between individuals\nsocalled fecal transplants which always\nmakes me a little bit uncomfortable to\nthink about never had one but you know\nit's pretty interesting you know despite\nthe discomfort of thinking about that\nprocess at least for me the the whole\nbusiness of taking the gut microbiota\nfrom one individual that's not suffering\nfrom something and putting it into\nanother individual and seeing Rel from\ncertain symptoms of given conditions is\nreally compelling so I think that we\nshould all be thinking about ways to\nsupport our gut brain AIS it's very\nclear that the best lowcost no\nsupplement way to do that is going to be\nto\nconsume one to four servings of some\nfermented food no beer doesn't count low\nsugar fermented foods I suppose beer\ndoes count but it comes with some other\nissues um such as you know kimch or\nSauer krauts or kefir or you know every\nculture seems to have its own uh\nprobiotic Prebiotic foods and that's\ngoing to be the best way and it's clear\nthat it has immense benefit and then\nwhen you don't have access to those\nFoods doing things like taking a pill\nprobiotic now and again is probably not\na bad idea if you're traveling or you're\nsleep deprived the the the challenge\nwith that sort of thing is\nthat it's a generalized effect of\nsupporting multiple systems in the brain\nand body body so it's going to be a long\ntime maybe never before you see a really\nnice clean study that says that okay\nincreasing the amount of lactobacillus\nin the gut by taking you know X number\nof milligrams of lactobacillus improves\nyour cognition you're not going to find\nthat study why because in science it's\nimportant and in health to distinguish\nbetween moderating effects and mediating\neffects lots of things can moderate a\ngiven feature of your brain or health so\nfor instance if uh you know God forbid a\nfire alarm went off tonight it would\nmoderate our tension or excuse me\nmodulate modulate Kies in California now\nI'm saying moderate\nmodulate your attention but it doesn't\nmediate attention on a normal basis you\nknow the fire alarm isn't involved in\nyour attention whereas certain other\nthings mediate those mechanisms of\nattention so when you improve sleep\nyou're going to see positive effects on\nany number of things when you sleep\ndeprive people you're going to see\ndeficit in any number of things these\nare not Direct effects these are\nindirect effects likewise with the\nmicrobiome so I think gut microbiome\nsits in the various what I call pillars\nof mental health physical health and\nperformance these are the things that we\nshould try and tend to on a regular\nbasis to give buoyancy to our mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nbut I wouldn't get too caught up in\nwondering which exact microbiota are\nimportant I think diversity of the\nmicrobiome is key if you're taking\nantibiotics you want to do something to\ncounter that through pill probiotics Etc\nand and certainly antibiotics aren't bad\nbut the overuse of antibiotics um\ncertainly can be and um good on you for\nhaving uh chemists that know better than\nto just hand me a bottle of triple\nantibiotic ointment quality of sleep\ngoing to bed early compared to sleeping\nlate but still for eight hours depends\ndepends on whether or not your\nchronotype which for a long time I did\nnot think was real but based on newer\ndata it's absolutely clear our real\nwhether or not you feel best going to\nbed early waking up early\nwe're going to bed at a more typical\ntime of 10: p.m. to say wake up or 11:00\np.m. and waking up at 7:00 a.m. I see\nthat you know for any folks leaving they\nlike early to bed right I get it I'm not\noffended it's fine the um I get it it\nwould not be the first time that people\nuh I always say if nothing else the\npodcast will cure insomnia because the\nepisodes are very very long um you know\nfor some people they just feel\nspectacularly better going to sleep\nearly and waking up early spectacularly\nbetter I'm one such person other people\nfeel much better staying up late waking\nup late the total duration of sleep is\nimportant the regularity of sleep it\nturns out is becoming a very important\nvariable or it has always been an\nimportant variable but the data are\npointing to the fact that if you are\nsomebody who feels best going to sleep\naround 11:00 p.m. and waking up at 7:00\na.m. trying to keep that to bedtime\nwithin plus or minus 1 hour anytime you\ncan except on a time and on night when\nthere's a lecture at the ICC theater is\na good idea but in general five nights\nout of the week you want to go to sleep\nwithin plus or minus an hour of the same\nbedtime that's kind of the general goal\nand in the Sleep series with Matt Walker\nhe talks about the quality quantity\nregularity and timing qqr T quantity\nquality regularity and timing of your\nsleep being the four key features of\nyour sleep to try and dial in but of\ncourse life isn't about optimizing\neverything it's good to get out and\nparty every once in a while stay up all\nwatch the sunrise and just live life\nalso so I think sometimes people get the\nimpression because I wear the same shirt\nall the time that I do everything in a\nhyper regimented way but actually it's\nquite the opposite I try and do things\nregularly and as consistently as\npossible so that deviations from those\nprotocols don't impact me negatively\nmuch at all that's the idea I have ADHD\nand I'm struggling to focus what would\nbe the best way to go about regaining my\nfocus Nick okay so I think that nowadays\nmany many people people struggle with um\nissues with Focus I think we have our\ndos and our do Nots and I'm obviously\nnot a psychiatrist and I can't diagnose\nyou Nick from a question on a on a slide\nbut there I just want to start off by\nsaying that there are indeed people who\ntruly struggle with Focus to the extent\nthat they have clinically diagnosable\nADHD and I've did two episodes on ADHD\nand focus one that was mainly focused on\nbehavioral tools and nutrition\nand to some extent supplementation and\nwhen I put out that episode about half\nof the comments out there were how could\nyou you don't respect modern science you\nhave no um Integrity how could you\nsuggest that people use these tools it's\nall about prescription drugs and the\nother half were like yes finally some\ntools and some acknowledgement that\nthese things actually matter and can\nhelp maybe even in conjunction with\npharmaceutical AIDS and then we did a\nsecond episode which is about the\nprescription drugs and it was the exact\nreverse people writing to me in droves\nsaying thank you so much I've been\nprescribing these drugs or I've been\ngiving these prescription drugs to my\nchild rather it's really been helping\nbut I'm embarrassed to tell everybody\nbecause then people demonize me and tell\nme I'm poisoning my kid that they're on\nmeth and then the other half saying how\ncould you the pharmaceutical industry\nbig Pharma is out to get us all I must\nsay that um and I'm happy to be in this\nrole um or not happy but I'm willing to\nbe in the role of try and cover it all\nand give people options I don't tell\npeople what to do I don't prescribe\nanything I profess many many things and\nyou should do is you decide is best for\nyou but just know what you're doing and\nhere's the deal that drugs like adderal\nviant Etc are indeed amphetamines that's\ntrue um in the young brain they can help\nenhance some of the neurom modulators\nthat allow\nfor elevated activity in areas like the\nprefrontal cortex and elsewhere that\nallow for more focused attention and\nless impuls ity because the main\nfunction of the prefrontal cortex as you\nmay all recall is to\nsay to the particular areas of the brain\nthat want to move or cause us to move or\ncause us to blurt things out like DMT or\nwhatever it is and sorry I didn't mean\nto pick on you I we'll do DMT together\nwe'll do some MDMA also and then we'll\nlike be we like we heart heart medicine\num\nso the reality is that there are\nneurochemical tools that can help help\nwith ADHD but there are also behavioral\ntools and in countries outside of the US\nnamely in China there are extensive\nefforts to train young people to focus\nfor longer periods of time and believe\nit or not they're not doing that through\nany D at least in these experiments\nthrough any Draconian approach they\nactually have them do what they have\nthem focus on visual targets the longer\nyou focus on a visual Target we know the\nlonger you bring about the activation of\ncertain neural circuit in the brain that\nallow for better focus and while not\neverything is about Vision it is\ncertainly the case based on those\nstudies and the data I've looked at them\nquite extensively that even a short\nperiod of time of learning to entrain\none's focus on a fixation points this\nwould be the Virgin side movement this\nis the Cuttlefish ready to eat or mate\nnot the Cuttlefish swimming around\nlooking for potential predators in\npanoramic mode doing that for a short\nperiod of time of even a minute or 3\nminutes can allow one to bring online\nthe neural circuits\nthat allow for enhanced focus in the\nsubsequent 10 to 20 minutes which is a\npretty reasonable bout of work if you\nthink about it and here's another\nimportant Point none of us none of us\nADHD sufferers or otherwise should\nexpect ourselves to be in perfect\ntrenches deep trenches of focus all the\ntime that's an unreasonable request for\nyour nervous system you can build up a\ncapacity to focus and of course we can\nall Focus best on things that we really\nenjoy in fact children and adults with\nADHD are known to have tremendous\nfocusing capacity if they're focusing on\nsomething they really enjoy this has\nbeen shown over and over again which\nmeans that the capacity to focus is\nthere it's just that the threshold to\nfocus is higher which means that it's\nharder to access and these visual\nfixation they're not even experiments\nyou can literally just place a visual\nTarget on the wall you know one to three\nfeet away force yourself to stare at\nthat visual Focus point and then move\ninto your work and you'll notice that\nyour mind will flit away from whatever\nit is you're trying to focus on but with\nsome training you can build up an\nenhanced capacity to focus it does\nrequire you flip your phone over you\nturn it off you leave it in the other\nroom you remove distractions some people\neven find children will find if they\nwear a brimmed hat and a hoodie which\nbasically took me through most of high\nschool for other reasons if you do that\nyou can create a more narrow tunnel of\nvision this is the reason they put\nblinders on horses so it sounds somewhat\num medieval it some sounds somewhat\nprimitive or crude but once again again\nwhat we're really talking about is\nremoving the expectation that focus is\nlike a square wave function where you\nknow you you sit down you open your book\nand boom you're focused I mean you\nwouldn't expect that of physical\nperformance would you there's a warm-up\nthere's some Dynamic stretching there's\nperhaps some just getting your mind in\nthe groove you know this sort of thing\nneural circuits are not\nonof it's not a square wave function\ntakes some time to ease into a motive\nfocus and so um my suggest question Nick\nis that you and others that struggle\nwith Focus think about the do Nots the\ndistractions that clearly are\nintervening in our ability to focus\nnowadays but also as you think about the\nthings to explore which may include\nthese pharmaceutical tools of course\nprescribed by a licensed physician but\nthat you consider that perhaps the\nexpectations that you're placing on\nyourself to focus are too immediate and\nthat you should train these up more\ngradually over time which is not to say\nthat you should settle on having limited\nFocus but that this is a skill that you\ncan develop like any other skill that\nyour nervous system is capable of\nplasticity throughout the lifespan we\nabsolutely know that and given that uh\nI'm presuming I don't know why I'm\npresuming that you're a young person but\neven if you're not that you can increase\nyour ability to access these narrow\ntrenches of focus even for things that\ndon't Delight you but I hope you are you\nare also doing some things that Delight\nyou so I was told that's the final\nquestion I'm going to take that very\nseriously um and somewhat unfortunately\nfor me because I could go all night um\nreally enjoyed tonight thank you very\nmuch thank you thank you so much\nI just thank you thanks so\nmuch thank\nyou truly thank you I really uh\nappreciate this opportunity to connect\nwith you all thanks for coming out the\nfact that people come out to listen to a\nbunch of Science and uh and uh Health\ndiscussion is greatly appreciated you\nknow all the tools all the protocols all\nthe mechanisms all the information while\nsome of it a very very small fraction of\nit was was developed or discovered in my\nlaboratory virtually everything that I\ncover on the podcast I've talked about\ntonight are the great discoveries of\nother people who deserve the credit and\nI've tried to give credit where where um\nwhere credit is due the most important\nthing to me of course is that um as you\neach learn and try these different tools\nand protocols as you see fit for you\nthat it would be wonderful if you'd pass\nthem on to other people um please please\nplease remove my name from that passage\nthis is not about me or the podcast it's\nreally about um the one uh thing we know\nto certainly be true about our species\nis that we can communicate information\nto one another handoff tools and that um\nin the case where these tools can help\nrelieve suffering wonderful in the case\nwhere these tools can help improve\nmental health physical health and\nperformance we uh we need to I believe\nand and should do that for one another\nand last but certainly not least thank\nyou for your interest in science\n[Applause]\n[Music]"
