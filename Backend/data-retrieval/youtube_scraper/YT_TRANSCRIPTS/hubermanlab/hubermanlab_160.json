    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. Peter Attia.\nDr. Attia is a physician who's focused on\nnutritional, supplementation-based,\nbehavioral, prescription\ndrug, and other interventions\nthat promote health span and lifespan.\nHis expertise spans\nfrom exercise physiology\nto sleep physiology,\nemotional and mental\nhealth and pharmacology.\nToday we talk about all\nthose areas of health,\nstarting with the very basics,\nsuch as how to evaluate\none's own health status\nand how to define one's health trajectory.\nWe also talk about the\nvarious sorts of interventions\nthat one can take in order\nto optimize vitality,\nwhile also extending\nlongevity, that is lifespan.\nDr. Attia's uniquely qualified to focus on\nthe complete depth and breadth\nof topics that we cover.\nAnd indeed, these are the\nsame topics that he works with\nhis patients on in his clinic every day.\nDr. Attia earned his Bachelor of Science\nin mechanical engineering\nand applied mathematics,\nand his MD from Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine.\nHe then went on to train\nat Johns Hopkins Hospital\nin general surgery,\none of the premier hospitals in the world,\nwhere he was the recipient of\nseveral prestigious awards,\nincluding Resident of the Year.\nHe's been an author on\ncomprehensive reviews\nof general surgery.\nHe spent two years at the\nNational Institute of Health\nas a surgical oncology fellow,\nat the National Cancer Institute,\nwhere his work focused on\nimmune-based therapies for melanoma.\nIn the fields of science and medicine,\nit is well understood that\nwe are much the product\nof our mentors and the\nmentoring we receive.\nDr. Attia has trained\nwith some of the best\nand most innovative\nlipidologists, endocrinologists,\ngynecologists, sleep physiologists\nand longevity scientists\nin the United States and Canada.\nSo the expertise that funnels through him\nand that he shares with us today\nis really harnessed from\nthe best of the best,\nand his extensive training and expertise.\nBy the end of today's episode,\nyou will have answers to\nimportant basic questions such as\nshould you have blood work?\nHow often should you do blood work?\nWhat specific things\nshould you be looking for\non that blood work, that\nare either counterintuitive\nor not often discussed,\nand yet that immediately\nand in the long-term\ninfluence your lifespan and health span?\nWe talk about hormone\nhealth and hormone therapies\nfor both men and women.\nWe talk about drug therapies\nthat can influence the mind\nas well as the body.\nAnd of course, we talk about\nsupplementation, nutrition,\nexercise, and predictors of\nlifespan and health span.\nIt is an episode rich with information.\nFor some of you, you may want\nto get out a pen and paper\nin order to take notes.\nFor others of you that learn\nbetter simply by listening,\nI just want to remind you\nthat we have timestamped\nall this information\nso that you can go back\nto the specific topics\nmost of interest to you.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all, they ship internationally,\nbecause we know that\nmany of you are located\noutside of the United States.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none,\nboth in terms of purity and precision\nof the amounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single ingredient supplements,\nand that are supplied in dosages\nthat allow you to build a\nsupplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add\nthings and remove things\nfrom your protocol\nin a way that's really\nsystematic and scientific.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we've partnered with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere you'll see those supplements,\nand just keep in mind that\nwe are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous,\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics\nthat are designed for your unique needs.\nNow, to be honest, I'm not a\nfan of the word nootropics,\nbecause nootropics means smart\ndrugs, and, to be honest,\nthere is no such thing as a smart drug,\nbecause there's no neural\ncircuit for being smart.\nThere are neural circuits\nrather for being creative\nor for task switching or for focus.\nAnd as we all know,\ndifferent sorts of demands,\nwhether or not they're\ncognitive or physical,\nrequire different types of\ncognitive and physical abilities.\nThesis understands this and has created\na kit of custom nootropics that\nare tailored to your needs.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\nyou can go to takethesis.com/huberman.\nTake their three minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas to\ntry in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman,\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first\nbox of custom nootropics.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done,\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays, with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also analyze, for instance,\nwhat your biological age is,\nand compare it to your chronological age.\nAnd obviously it's your biological\nage that really matters.\nThe challenge with a lot of\nblood tests and DNA tests,\nhowever, is that you get information back\nabout metabolic factors,\nhormones, and so forth,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes it very easy\nto know what to do with that information\nto optimize your health.\nThey have a personalized platform,\nit's a dashboard that you go to.\nYou can click on the level of\nany hormone, metabolic factor,\nlipid, et cetera, and it will tell you\nthe various sorts of\ninterventions based on nutrition,\nsupplementation, et\ncetera, that you can use\nto bring those numbers into the ranges\nthat are ideal for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThey also have some\nreally unique features,\nbecause they are customized\nto your unique sleep needs.\nI've talked over and over\nagain on this podcast\nand on other podcasts,\nabout the fact that\nsleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nThere's just simply no other substitute\nfor a quality night's\nsleep on a regular basis.\nI've been sleeping on a Helix mattress\nfor well over a year now,\nand it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had.\nAnd that's in large part,\nbecause the mattress was designed for me.\nWhat you need to know, however,\nis what's the ideal mattress for you.\nAnd you can do that by\ngoing to Helix's site.\nYou can take their brief\nquiz which will ask you\ndo you sleep on your side,\nyour back, your stomach,\nor maybe you don't know,\nor maybe all three,\ndo you tend to run hot or cold\nin the night, maybe you know,\nmaybe you don't.\nAt the end of that short quiz,\nthey will match you to the\nideal mattress for you.\nI matched to the dusk, the\nD-U-S-K mattress, but again,\nthat's what I need.\nThat's not necessarily what you need\nin order to get your best night's sleep.\nBut if you're interested\nin upgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you,\nand you'll get up to $200\noff any mattress order\nand two free pillows, they\nhave terrific pillows.\nAnd you get to try out that mattress\nfor 100 nights risk-free.\nThey'll even pick it up for\nyou if you don't love it,\nbut I'm certain you will.\nAgain, if you're interested\nyou go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\nfor up to $200 off your mattress\norder and two free pillows.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Peter Attia.\nPeter, thanks for joining me today.\n- Thanks for having me, man.\n- I've been looking forward\nto this for a very long time.\n- [Peter] As have I.\n- I'm a huge fan of your podcast.\nI know that you went to Stanford\nand worked with a number of people\nthat are colleagues of mine.\nSo for me, this is already a\nthrill, just to be doing this.\n- Yeah, well, it's likewise.\n- I have a ton of questions,\nbut I want to start off with something\nthat I wonder a lot about,\nand that I know many other\npeople wonder about, which is\nhow to assess their current\nhealth and their trajectory\nin terms of health and wellbeing,\nspecifically as it relates to blood work.\nSo what are your thoughts on blood work?\nIs it necessary for the typical person?\nSo this is somebody who's not dealing with\nsome acute syndrome or illness.\nAnd at what age would you suggest\npeople start getting blood work?\nHow frequently should they get blood work?\nHow often do you get blood\nwork done, et cetera?\n- Yeah, there's a lot there.\nI mean, the way I talk\nabout this with patients is,\nfirst, taking everything\nback to the objective.\nSo what's the thing\nwe're trying to optimize?\nSo if a person says, look,\nI'm trying to break 10\nhours for an Ironman,\nI don't know that blood\nwork is going to be\na game-changing aspect of their trajectory\nand their training.\nYou know, they're going\nto benefit much more\nfrom sort of functional\nanalyses of performance.\nSo I'm assuming, based on the question,\nthat you're really coming\nat this through the lens of\nliving longer and living better\nthrough the lifespan health span\nlens?\n- Mostly, yeah.\nI think most people have\nsome sense of their vitality\nor lack of vitality, but\nI think everyone wonders\nwhether or not they could feel better,\nand whether or not blood work\nwill give them a window into\nhow they might go about feeling better.\n- Yeah, I think it does to some extent,\nbut I also think that it\nhas a lot of blind spots.\nSo I kind of break things down into\nthe two vectors that make up longevity,\nwhich are lifespan and health span.\nSo lifespan is the easiest of\nthose vectors to understand,\nbecause it's pretty binary.\nYou're alive or you're not alive.\nYou're respiring or you're not.\nYou make ATP or you don't, end of story.\nSo what gets in the way of lifespan\nis essentially the four\nhorsemen of disease, right?\nSo atherosclerotic disease, cancer,\nneurodegenerative disease,\nand metabolic disease,\nwhich directly isn't the\ncause of many deaths,\nbut basically creates the foundation\nto all of those other diseases.\nSo, you know, if you're a non-smoker,\nwhat I just rattled off is\nabout 80% of your death.\nSo how does blood work help address those?\nIt varies.\nSo on the atherosclerotic standpoint,\nit's a very good predictor of risk,\nif you know what to look for.\nSo primarily ApoB would be\nthe single most important\nlipoprotein that we care about.\nI can explain what that means in a second.\nAnd then also, other\nmarkers of inflammation,\nendothelial health, and metabolic health.\nWhen it comes to cancer, you know,\nblood testing in the sense of biomarkers\nis not particularly helpful,\noutside of knowing that the\nsecond leading environmental\nor modifiable cause of cancer\nis metabolic ill health, after smoking.\nSo we don't actually\nknow a lot about cancer\nin the sense of what causes it.\nIt's really stochastic,\nand it's a lot of bad luck.\nSo we know that smoking\ndrives it, and we know that,\neven though epidemiologically\nwe say obesity drives it,\nwhat it really means is\nmetabolic poor health.\nIt's probably the hyperinsulinemia\nthat comes with obesity that drives it.\nSo biomarkers help with that,\nbut there's still an enormous\nblind spot to cancer.\nWe could talk about liquid biopsies aside,\n'cause those aren't\nreally biomarker studies,\nbut put that away.\nOn the neurodegenerative side, you know,\nI don't think we have a lot of insight\nthat comes to understanding\nParkinson's disease,\nbut when it comes to dementia,\nparticularly Alzheimer's disease,\nwhich is the most\nprevalent form of dementia,\nI think the biomarkers\ncan be quite helpful.\nThey overlap a lot with the\natherosclerotic diseases.\nSo the same things that\ndrive the risk of heart disease\nare driving the risk of dementia.\nAnd then there's some novel stuff as well,\nif you include genetic testing,\nwhich you can get out of a blood test.\nWe get a whole suite of\ngenes, not just APOE,\nbut far more nuanced stuff than that,\nthat can also play a role.\nSo you can stratify risk in that sense.\nSo in aggregate, I would say, you know,\nblood testing of biomarkers\nprovides pretty good\ninsight into lifespan.\nWhen you get into health\nspan, you have kind of\nthe cognitive, physical,\nemotional domains.\nI think here the biomarkers\nare far less helpful,\nand here we kind of rely\nmore on functional testing.\nSo when it comes to sort of\nthe cognitive piece, you know,\nyou can do cognitive testing.\nIn terms of long-term risk,\na lot of the things that imply\ngood cognitive health as you age,\nare in line with the same things\nthat you would do to reduce\nthe risk of dementia.\nSo all the biomarkers that\nyou would look to improve\nthrough dementia risk reduction,\nyou would be improving\nthrough cognitive health.\nOn the physical side,\nI mean, outside of looking\nat hormone levels and things\nwhich we look at extensively,\nand understanding how those might aid in\nor prevent some of the metrics\nthat matter, it really is,\nthis is a biomarker aside thing.\nI mean, I'd be much more\ninterested in a person's DEXA,\nCPET testing, VO2 max testing, you know,\nzone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.\nThose are what I would\nconsider more functional tests\nthat give me far more insight into that.\nAnd then of course the emotional piece,\nwhich depending on who you are,\nmight be the single most important piece,\nwithout which none of this\nother stuff matters, right?\nIf you're a totally miserable human being,\nyour relationships suck,\nI don't think any of\nthis other stuff matters.\nAnd certainly there's\nnothing that I'm looking at\nin biomarkers that's giving\nme great insight into that.\n- Do you ask about emotional state,\nor do you try and assess\nemotional state indirectly\nwhen you do an intake\nwith one of your patients?\n- Probably not so much in the intake,\nbecause I think it takes a\nwhile to form a relationship\nwith a patient before\nthat starts to become\nsomething that they're\nnecessarily going to want to\ntalk with you about.\nBut I definitely think of\nit as an important part\nof what we do.\nAnd I think without it,\nnone of this other stuff really matters.\nAgain, the irony of thinking about\nhow many years I spent\nsort of in pursuit of\nfully optimizing every\ndetail of everything,\nwithout any attention being\npaid to that dimension,\nis not lost on me.\nAnd look, there are some patients who,\nthat's just not something that,\nthat's something that's compartmentalized.\nMaybe they're, you know,\nthey're doing well in that\ndepartment, or maybe they aren't,\nbut they just aren't willing\nto engage on that yet.\n- In terms of frequency of blood testing,\nif somebody feels pretty good\nand is taking a number of\nsteps, exercise, nutrition,\net cetera, to try and extend lifespan\nand improve health span,\nis once a year frequent enough,\nand should a 20-year-old\nstart getting blood work done\njust to get a window into what's going on?\nAssuming that they can afford it\nor their insurance can cover it.\n- Yeah, I mean, look, I\ncertainly think everybody\nshould be screened early in\nlife because if you look at,\nlike, what's the single most\nprevalent genetic driver\nof atherosclerosis, is Lp[a].\nSo unfortunately most\nphysicians don't know\nwhat Lp[a] is,\nand yet somewhere between\neight and 12% of the population\nhas a high enough, and\ndepending on who you, you know,\nI had a recent guest on my podcast\nwho suggested it could be as high as 20%,\nhave a high enough Lp[a],\nthat it is contributing\nto atherosclerosis.\nSo to not want to know that,\nwhen it's genetically determined, right,\nthis is something that,\nyou're born with this\nand you only need to really check it once,\nwhy we wouldn't want to\nknow that in a 20-year-old,\nwhen it can contribute to a lot\nof the early atherosclerosis\nwe see in people.\nIt's leaving money on\nthe table, in my opinion.\nThe frequency with which you need to test\nreally comes down to the\nstate of interventions.\nI don't think it makes\nsense to just do blood tests\nfor the sake of doing blood tests.\nThere has to be kind of a reason.\nIs something changing?\nYou know, a blood test\nis, for the most part,\na static intervention.\nIt's a look at a window in time.\nAnd there's benefit in having\na few of those over the course of a year,\nif you're unsure about a level.\nSo if something comes back and\nit doesn't look great, yeah,\nit might make sense just to recheck it\nwithout reacting to it.\nBut typically, you know, in patients,\nwe might check blood two\nto four times a year,\nbut we're also probably doing\nthings in there to now check,\nlike hey, you know, we gave this drug,\ndid it have the desired outcome?\nYou put on three pounds of muscle\nand lost three pounds of fat,\ndid it have the desired outcome?\n- Speaking of tracking weight and fat,\nlean mass percentages, is that\nsomething that you recommend\nyour patients do pretty often?\nI know people that step\non the scale every day,\nI know people like myself that frankly,\nI might step on the\nscale three times a year.\nI don't really care.\nI pay attention to other things\nthat are far more subjective.\nMaybe I'm making a huge mistake.\nWhat are your thoughts about\nquantitative measurements of weight, BMI,\nfor the typical person?\n- I think they're pretty crude.\nI think a DEXA, I'd rather\ntake a DEXA annually,\nand then maybe follow weight\na little bit more closely\nto get a sense of it.\nAnd so with a DEXA you're getting,\nat least the way we look at the data,\nfour pieces of information.\nNow, most people when they do a DEXA,\nshould I explain what that is, I'm?\n- Yeah, I think some people\nmight not know what DEXA is.\nIn fact, I confess, I\nhave a crude understanding\nof what it is.\nTell me where I'm wrong,\nand hopefully where I'm\nat least partially right.\nMy understanding is\nthat there are a number of\ndifferent ways to measure\nlean mass to non-lean mass ratio,\nand there's one where\nthey put you underwater.\nThere's one where they\nput you into some sort of\nnon-underwater chamber.\nThere's calipering.\nAnd then there's the looking\nin the mirror and pinching\nand changing the lighting.\n- You know, it's funny,\nif you've done it enough, you can,\nI can sort of tell my\nbody fat by my abs, right.\nSo I can sort of tell by, you know,\nhow good the six pack or\nhow bad the six pack is,\nwhat the leanness is.\nAnd that's actually not\na terrible way to do it.\nA bodybuilder, for example,\nwhich I've never been,\ncan tell you the difference\nbetween being 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%,\njust based on the degree of\nvisibility within the abs.\nBut basically, a DEXA scan is an x-ray.\nSo it's the same principle as\njust getting a chest x-ray,\nwhere ionizing radiation\nis passed through the body.\nAnd there's a plate behind the body\nthat collects what comes through.\nAnd the denser the medium\nthat the electrons are\ntrying to go through,\nthe less of them that are collected.\nSo when you look at an x-ray,\nas everybody's probably seen an x-ray,\nthat which is white is most dense.\nSo if you had, you know, a\npiece of metal in your pocket,\nit would show up as a bright white thing.\nThat's why ribs and\nbones show up as white,\nand the things that are the\nleast dense, like the lungs,\nwhere it's just air, are the blackest.\nAnd everything is a\nshade of gray in between.\nSo a DEXA is just doing that effectively,\nbut it's a moving x-ray.\nSo you lay down on a bed and\nit takes maybe 10 minutes,\nand this little, very low power x-ray\nkind of goes over your body.\nAnd the plate beneath it\nis collecting information\nthat is basically allowing\nit to differentiate\nbetween three things, bone\nmineral content, fat, other.\nAnd the other is quantified\nas lean body mass.\nSo that's organs,\nmuscles, everything else.\nSo when most people do a DEXA,\nthey get the report back,\nand the reports are horrible.\nI've yet to see one company\nthat can do this in a way\nthat isn't abjectly horrible.\nWe've created our own templates,\nso we have our own dashboard\nfor how we do this,\n'cause we've just given up\non trying to use theirs.\nBut the first thing most people look at is\nwhat's my body fat.\nAnd this is the gold standard\noutside of like MRI or something,\nthat's only used for research purposes.\nSo a DEXA is going to\nproduce a far better estimate\nof body fat, than calipers\nor buoyancy testing,\nor things like that,\nprovided the machinery is well-calibrated,\nand the operator knows how to use it.\nI've heard some people argue\nthat in the hands of like\nthe guy who's been doing\ncalipers his whole life,\nit could probably be\ncomparable with calipers.\nBut nevertheless, for\nan off-the-shelf tech,\nDEXA is amazing.\nOf the four things that\nget spit out of the DEXA,\nwe think that the body fat\nis the least interesting.\nAnd so I would rank that\nas fourth on the list of\nwhat's germane to your health.\nThe other three things\nthat you get spit out\nare bone mineral density, visceral fat,\nand then the metrics that\nallow you to compute,\nlike to basically compute what's called\nappendicular lean mass index\nand fat-free mass index.\nAnd so those three metrics are\nsignificantly more important\nthan body fat.\nAnd the reason is as follows, right?\nSo, bone mineral density\nbasically speaks to your risk\nof osteoporosis and osteopenia.\nAnd that doesn't sound very sexy\nto people our age, you know.\n50-year-old guys listening to this,\nit's like, yeah, big deal.\nBut for a 50-year-old woman,\nthis is a huge deal, right?\nA woman who's just about\nto go through menopause,\nor has just gone through menopause,\nis at an enormous risk for osteopenia,\nand then ultimately osteoporosis,\nbecause estrogen is the\nsingle most important hormone\nin regulating bone mineral density.\nAnd we can come back and talk\nabout why that's the case,\nbut it's very interesting\nhow the biomechanics of bones work,\nand why estrogen\nspecifically is so important.\nAnd this is a huge cause\nof morbidity, right?\nSo, you know, if you're over the age of 65\nand you fall and break your hip,\nyour one year morbidity\nis about 30 to 40%.\nWhich again, just to put that in English,\nif you're 65 or older, you\nfall and break your hip,\nthere's a 30 to 40% chance\nyou're dead in a year.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- Bones matter.\nSo we want to really get a\nsense of where you stack up\nfor your age, for your sex.\nAnd if you're anywhere off the pace,\nwe have to ramp up our strategy\nand be super aggressive\nabout how to increase\nthat, or at a minimum,\nprevent any further decay.\n- And are there age-related charts\nfor these sorts of things?\n- Yeah, this all gets spit out\ninto what's called a Z-score.\nSo when you're looking at your BMD,\nit's going to give you a Z-score.\nSo a Z-score of zero means,\nand you understand this,\nbut it's like, a Z-score referring to\na probability distribution\nin a standard mode.\nSo Z-score of zero means\nyou're at the 50th percentile\nfor your age and sex.\nA Z-score of plus one, you're\none standard deviation above,\nminus one, below, et cetera.\nThere's also a T-score, which\nis doing the same thing,\nbut comparing you to a young person.\nAnd so the T-score is technically used\nto make the diagnosis of\nosteopenia or osteoporosis.\nWe tend to look more at the\nZ-score, and basically say,\nlook, if your Z-score\nright now is minus one,\nin four years I want\nyour Z-score to be zero.\nNot necessarily because you've\nincreased that entire way,\nbut maybe you've increased slightly\nwhile it's expected that\nyou would've declined.\n- I see.\nWhat are some things\nthat we can do to improve\nbone mineral density at any age?\n- So it turns out there's\na real critical window\nin which we are malleable.\nSo depending on the age at\nwhich someone's listening to us\ndiscuss this, you know,\nif you're under 20, 25,\nyou are still in that time of your life\nwhen you are able to reach your potential.\nSo it turns out that strength training\nis probably the single\nbest thing you can do.\nAnd this was a surprise to\nme, 'cause we, you know,\nwe did an AMA on this\ntopic a little while ago,\nand that's when I got really deep on this\nwith our analysts.\nMy assumption was\nrunning must be the best,\nlike some sort of impact must\nbe the best thing you can do.\nYou know, I assumed\nrunning would be better\nthan swimming and cycling.\nBut it turned out that power lifting\nwas probably the best thing you could do.\nAnd I think once you\nunderstand how bones work,\nit became more clear, which is, you know,\npower lifting is really\nputting more of a sheer force\nfrom the muscle via the\ntendon onto the bone,\nand that's what the\nbones are really sensing.\nThey're sensing that sheer force\nthat's being applied through\nthe bone, in a compressive way,\ndepending on the bone of course.\nAnd that's what's basically\nactivating the osteoblasts,\nwhich are the cells that are\nallowing bone to be built.\nSo this turns out to be probably\nmore important for females,\nbecause how high you can get\nduring that period of development,\nsay till you're 20 or 25,\nbasically sets your trajectory\nfor the rest of your life.\nSo where we get into real\ntrouble is with patients who,\nfor example, used large\namounts of inhaled steroids\nduring that period of their life,\n'cause let's say they\nhad really bad asthma.\nOr patients who needed large\namounts of corticosteroids\nfor some other immune-related condition.\nSo during their critical\nwindow of development,\nthey were taking a drug that\nwas impairing this process.\nSo, you know, we have\nsome patients like that\nin our practice and that's\njust an enormous liability\nthat we're working\nreally hard to overcome,\nwith nutrition, with hormones,\nwith drugs, with training.\nAnd, you know, it's just\nsomething you have to be aware of.\n- I wasn't aware that inhalants for asthma\nand things of that sort can\nimpair bone mineral density.\n- If they're steroid-based.\nSome of them of course\nare just beta-agonists,\nand they're fine.\n- So anything corticosteroid like?\n- Yep.\n- Interesting.\nAnd then I always get asked this question,\nand I always reflexively want to say no,\nbut I don't really know the\nanswer so I don't reply.\nWhat about topical corticosteroid?\nYou know, people will put cortisone cream.\nTo me, it seems almost inconceivable\nthat it would have a systemic\neffect, but then again,\nwhat do I know?\n- It's all dose and time-related.\nSo, you know, if you're\ntalking about like I've got\na little rash under my skin,\nI'm going to put corticosteroids\non, probably not.\nBut certainly, with enough of it put on,\nI mean it is absorbed,\nso it could be an issue.\nBut that's not typically\nwhat we're concerned with.\nI mean, we're mostly\nconcerned with people that are\ntaking even modest amounts of prednisone\nfor months, years at a time.\nOr, like I said, kids that\nare using steroid inhalers\nfor years and years and years.\nAgain, I'm not suggesting\nthat if your kid's on a steroid\ninhaler they shouldn't be.\nYou have to solve the\nmost important problem,\nand if asthma is the most\nimportant problem, so be it.\nI think you just want to\nturn that into, okay, well,\nhow much more imperative is it\nthat our kid is doing\nthings that are putting\na high amount of stress on\ntheir bones, via their muscles,\nto make sure that they're in\nthat maximal capacity to build.\n- Do you think that somebody\nin their 30s or 40s or 50s\ncould still benefit from\nstrength training in terms of\nbone mineral density and longevity,\nas it relates to bone mineral density,\ngiven that there's this\nkey window earlier,\nthey might have missed that one.\n- Oh yeah, no, no, this is\nessential for the rest of life\nbecause you're now trying\nto prevent the fall off.\nSo basically the way it\nworks is you're sort of,\nfrom birth to say 20 you're in growth.\nFrom 20 to 50, you plateau.\nAt 50, men start to decline,\nbut it's really small.\nWomen start to decline\nand it's precipitous.\n- And it's related to the drop in estrogen\nassociated with menopause or premenopause?\n- [Peter] Correct.\n- And can we get into\nany of the broad contours\nof what that strength training looks like?\nWe had Dr. Andy Galpin on the show,\nhe talked a lot about\nways to build strength\nversus hypertrophy versus\nendurance, et cetera.\nI think there's pretty good\nagreement across the fields of\nphysiotherapy, et cetera,\nof physiology and medicine,\nin terms of how to do that.\nBut my understanding is\nfairly low repetition ranges,\nso this is anywhere from\none to six repetitions.\nTypically not aiming\nfor a pump hypertrophy,\nthat sort of thing.\nBut heavy loads that are hard to move,\n80% of one repetition maximum or more,\ndone with long rest periods,\ntwo to three times a week type\nthing, is that about right?\n- Yeah, if you look at\nthe literature on this,\nit's going to tell you,\nit's going to differentiate\npower lifting from weightlifting.\nIn other words, yeah,\nyou do need to be kind of moving\nagainst a very heavy load.\nNow again, that can look very different\ndepending on your level of experience.\nLike I really like deadlifting.\nNow, I mean, I can count the\nnumber of days left in my life\nwhen I'm going to want to\ndo sets over 400 pounds.\nBut, you know, I'll pick and\nchoose the days that I do.\nBut, you know, I grew\nup doing those things,\nI'm comfortable with those movements.\nIf I had a 60-year-old woman\nwho's never lifted weights in her life,\nwho we now have to get lifting,\nI mean, we could get her\nto deadlift, but I think,\nI wouldn't make perfect the enemy of good.\nI'd be happy to put her\non a leg press machine\nand just get her doing that.\nYou know, it's not as pure\na movement as a deadlift,\nbut who cares, right?\nWe can still put her at\na heavy load, for her,\nand do so safely.\nSo, now that said, I mean,\nthere was a study that\nwas done in Australia,\nand I'm, you know, hopefully\nwe can find a link to it.\nThere's a video on YouTube that\nactually kind of has the PI\nsort of walking through the results.\nI could send it to you.\n- [Andrew] Okay, yeah we'll\ntrack it down.\n- And it's just amazing.\nThey took a group of older women.\nThey looked like they\nwere in their 60s or 70s,\nwho had never lifted\nweights in their life,\nwho had osteopenia,\nand some probably\nalready had osteoporosis,\nand they basically just put them on\na strength training protocol.\nAnd it is remarkable to watch these women.\nThey're doing good mornings.\nThey're doing dead lifts.\nThey're picking heavy\nthings up off the ground.\nI think one woman was picking up,\nGod, I want to say she was like\npicking like 50, 60 kilos up\noff the ground.\nI mean, just staggering sums\nof weight for these women\nwho have never done anything.\nAnd their bone health is\nimproving at this age.\nSo the goal, frankly,\nis to just, you know,\nnever get to the point where\nyou have to do this for the first time.\nStrength training is such an\nessential part of our existence\nthat it's never too late to start,\nbut you should never stop.\n- I love that advice.\nIs it a systemic effect or a local effect?\nSo, for instance, let's say that, well,\nmy mother's in her late 70s.\nShe actually used to be really\nstrong when we were kids.\nShe could move this fish\ntank that was in my room\nlong before I could move\nit, and I was always,\nshe's really strong.\nOver the years, I wouldn't\ncall her frail by any means,\nbut I certainly think she could benefit\nfrom some strength training.\nLet's say she were to start\ndoing some leg presses\nor start even with air squats\nand maybe work up to some pushups,\nare the effects all local,\nmeaning if she were to just train her legs\nor just do pushups,\nwould it only be the\nloads applied to the limbs\nand muscles and tissues\nthat were involved?\n- I think that's where\nthe bulk of it is, yeah.\n- Okay.\n- Yeah.\n- [Andrew] So you need to train\nthe whole body, essentially.\n- Yeah, now keep in mind,\nthe diagnosis of\nosteopenia and osteoporosis\nis based on only three\nlocations, the left hip,\nthe right hip, and the lumbar spine.\nSo, you know, that's just the convention\nby which we make the diagnosis.\nAnd I think part of that has to do with\nthat's where the majority\nof the insults occur.\nNow not all of the insults,\nI've seen people that have,\nyou know, because of\nhorrible bone density,\nthey're fracturing\nankles and tibia, fibula,\nlike they're having low tib\nfib fractures just walking.\nSo clearly bone density\noutside of those regions does matter.\nBut much of it is really\nfocused on, and, by the way,\nyou know, you fall, you break a wrist,\nso this is a systemic issue.\nBut the majority of the\nresponse is a local response,\n'cause it really comes\ndown to putting a load\ndirectly on that bone, and\nthen having that bone, in kind,\nrespond by laying down more bone.\n- Before we continue\nwith today's discussion,\nI'd like to just briefly acknowledge\nour sponsor Athletic\nGreens, now called AG1.\nAthletic Greens, aka AG1, is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also has adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since way back in 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still drink\nAthletic Greens twice a day\nis that it supplies total\nfoundational coverage\nof my vitamin mineral needs,\nand it supplies important\nnutrients that I need\nto support my gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome, as many of you know,\nsupports the immune system.\nIt also supports the\nso-called gut brain access,\nwhich is vital for\nmood, for energy levels,\nfor regulating focus,\nand many other features\nof our mental health and physical health\nthat impact our daily\nperformance and high performance\nin any endeavors we might be involved in.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away five free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of vitamin\nD3 K2, with every order.\nAnd of course, vitamin D3 K2 are vital\nfor all sorts of things\nlike hormone health\nand metabolic health,\nand K2 for cardiovascular\nhealth and calcium regulation.\nAgain, you can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nYou mentioned falling and\nthe problems with falling\nand breaking things, and\nmortality related to that.\nI wonder whether or not there are also\nhealth-related effects\nof just having weak bones\nthat are not just about\nfalling and breaking a bone,\nand dying a year later.\nThat's obviously very severe.\nBecause I think when\npeople hear about that,\nsome people might think, well,\nI'll just be more careful.\nI'll just move more slowly.\nI'll sit in a wheelchair if I need to,\neven though I might be able to walk,\nif it keeps me from falling.\nSome people I think adopt that mentality.\nWhat are some of the benefits of having\nhigh bone mineral density\nfor men and women,\nthat are perhaps independent\nof risk of injury?\n- Well, I think it's actually the inverse\nof what you just said, right?\nIt's sort of like, you have to\nsort of be able to articulate\nwhat it is you want in\nyour marginal decade.\nSo we use this thing in our practice\ncalled the marginal decade.\nMarginal decade is the\nlast decade of your life.\nSo everyone will have a marginal decade.\nThat's the only thing I can tell you\nwith absolute certainty, right?\n- I believe you.\n- There's no immortality.\nThere's no hidden elixir\nthat's going to help us live\nto be, you know, whatever.\nI mean, we're all going to be in\nour last decade at some point.\nAnd outside of people who die suddenly\nor through an accident,\nmost of us know when we're\nin that marginal decade.\nYou might not know the day you enter it,\nbut most people, you\nknow, who are old enough,\nif you tell them, are you in\nthe last decade of your life,\nthey probably have a sense that they are.\nSo I think the exercise\nthat we like to go through\nwith our patients very\nearly on is have them,\nin exquisite detail,\nmore detail than they've ever considered,\nso we have to prompt them\nwith like 50 questions,\nlay out what their marginal\ndecade should look like.\n- Wow, that's a serious exercise.\n- It's a very serious exercise, right?\nLike what, tell me everything\nthat is going to happen\nin your marginal decade.\nI don't know when it's\ngoing to be, Andrew,\nit could be 87 to 97 if\nwe're doing well, right?\nIt might be 79 to 89, I don't know.\nBut, you know, it would really\nbe a very nuanced exploration\nof that topic.\nAnd I think until you do that,\nall of this other stuff is just abstract\nand kind of nonsense.\nUntil a person can tell you\nwhat it is that they want to\nbe doing in that last decade,\nyou can't design a\nprogram to get them there.\nI mean, think about it.\nSomeone wants to do an Ironman,\nwe take it for granted that\nwe know what the objective is.\nI have to be able to swim 2 1/2 miles.\nI have to be able to get\nout, take my wetsuit off,\nhop on my bike, ride 112\nmiles, get off my bike,\ntake the bike shoes off,\nput the run shoes on,\nrun 26.2 miles.\nLike we get it, we know\nwhat the objective is.\nAnd only by knowing that can you train.\nCan you imagine if I said to you,\nAndrew, I'm going to have you do\nan athletic event in a\nyear, start training.\nI'm not going to tell you\nwhat it is, just do it.\nCould be playing basketball.\nYou know, it could be\nswimming to Catalina Island.\nIt could be running 100 miles.\nYou wouldn't be able to do it.\nSo similarly, if we don't know\nwhat our marginal decade is meant to be,\nthere's no way to train for it.\n- Do you think this is a good exercise\nfor anyone and everyone\nto do on their own,\nregardless of age here?\nI'm hearing this\n- Absolutely.\n- and I'm thinking,\nI need to think about when\nmy last decade might be\nand what I want that to look like.\n- Absolutely, I mean, when I\nsay we do it with our patients,\nthat's only because that's\nthe population I work with.\nBut there's simply no reason\neverybody shouldn't be\ngoing through this exercise.\n- And then you sort of\nback script from there,\nfigure out what people should be doing,\ngiven their current health status.\n- Exactly right, we call it back casting.\nSo the first step we do is,\nonce we've really delineated\nwhat the objective function\nlooks like, we then say, okay,\nhow do you break down that into\nmetrics that we can measure?\nSo, you know, you described\ndoing a whole bunch of things.\nOkay, just to let you know,\nto do that will require\na VO2 max of 30 milliliters of oxygen\nper minute per kilogram.\nAnd the person will say,\nokay, what does that mean?\nWe'll say, well, that's a\nmeasure of your maximal uptake\nof oxygen, and that declines\nat about 8% to 10% per decade.\nSo if you have to be at 30,\nand let's just assume you're\ngoing to be doing that at 90,\nso what do you need to\nbe at 80, 70, 60, 50.\nOkay, here's what it\nwould need to be at 50.\nOkay, what are you now?\nAh, there's a big gap.\nYou're below where you need to be now.\nSo you're obviously higher than 30 now,\nbut if you're only at 42 now\nand you need to be at 30 and 40 years,\nyou're not going to cut it.\nYou have to be a lot fitter.\nOkay, now let's do the same exercise\naround strength and stability.\nAnd without exception, most people,\nwhen they do this exercise,\nwill find out they're well\nbelow where they need to be.\nSo the gravity of aging is more\nvicious than people realize,\nand therefore the height\nof your glider needs to be\nmuch higher than you think\nit is when you're our age,\nif you want to be able to do the things\nwe probably want to be\nable to do when we're 90.\n- I absolutely love this approach.\nI've never done it in terms of my health.\nI've always thought about\nwhat I want to accomplish\nin the next three to six\nmonths or next year or so.\n- And by the way, that's a great approach.\nThat's forecasting.\nForecasting is fantastic.\nForecasting is really\ngood at short-term things.\nIt doesn't work for long-term things.\nLong-term, you have to do back casting.\n- This back casting approach\nreally appeals to me\nbecause in my career, well, I\nnever anticipate, excuse me.\nI never anticipated I'd be podcasting.\nBut that's what I did at some\npoint as an undergraduate,\nI looked at professors,\nI'm like, that looks\nlike a pretty good life.\nThey seem pretty happy, I\ntalked to a few of them,\nand then I figured out what\nI need to do at each stage\nin order to get to that\nnext rung on the ladder,\nand just kind of figured it out\nin a back casting kind of\nway, as you refer to it.\nI think this is incredibly useful\nbecause it puts all the\nquestions about blood work\nand how often to get blood\nwork and what to measure,\nin a really nice context\nthat's a highly individualized.\nI've never heard of this before, so.\n- And I should give a nod to Annie Duke.\nI used to always refer to\nthis as reverse engineering,\nbut in Annie Duke's book,\nshe wrote about this exact thing\nand called it back casting,\nand I was like, I like the\nterm back casting better.\nI think it's more intuitive\nthan reverse engineering.\n- Yeah, there's a real\ngenius to it and I think it,\n'cause it sets so many things\ninto the appropriate\nbins and trajectories.\nI've heard you talk before\nabout some of the prime movers\nfor longevity and all-risk mortality.\nAnd I'd love for you to review\na little bit of that for us.\nI think we all know\nthat we shouldn't smoke\nbecause it's very likely\nthat we'll die earlier\nif we smoke nicotine.\nI'm neither a marijuana\nnor a nicotine smoker,\nso I feel on stable ground there.\nBut anytime we see smoking nowadays,\npeople really want to distinguish\nbetween cannabis and nicotine.\nSo I am curious about\nany differences there\nin terms of impact on longevity.\nBut in that context,\nwhat are the things that\nanyone and everyone can do,\nshould do, to live longer basically?\n- How long you got?\n- Well, you tell me.\nYou tell me.\nI'd like to live, to be,\nI'd like my final decade\nto be between 90 and 100.\n- Oh no, I meant how long do you,\nyeah yeah.\n- No no, I'm just kidding.\nI'm just kidding.\n- And will we spend\nfrom now until you're\n90 talking about this?\n- Well, there's a risk of that.\nBut top contour is fine,\nI know you've done a\nlot of content on this,\nand we will give people links\nto some of that more in depth content.\nBut, you know, let's say\nwe were on a short flight\nfrom here to San Diego,\nwe're in Los Angeles now,\nand we got take off and landing,\nand we don't want to\nkink our neck too much\nby doing this thing.\nSo if I just said, hey, you know,\ngimme the extended version\nof the three by five card.\nWhat does that look like?\n- So, let's start with\na couple of the things\nthat you've already highlighted.\nSo smoking, how much does\nsmoking increase your risk\nof all-cause mortality?\nAnd the reason we like to\ntalk about what's called ACM,\nor all-cause mortality,\nis it's really agnostic to how you die.\nAnd that doesn't always make sense.\nI mean, if you're talking about, you know,\na very specific intervention,\nlike a anti-cancer therapeutic,\nyou really care about\ncancer-specific mortality\nor heart-specific mortality.\nBut when we talk about\nthese sort of broad things,\nwe like to talk about ACM.\nSo, you know, using smoking,\nsmoking is approximately a 40%\nincrease in the risk of ACM.\n- What does that translate to in,\nthat means I'm shortening my life by 40%?\n- No, it means at any point in time,\nthere's a 40% greater risk\nthat you're going to die\nrelative to a non-smoker\nand a never smoker.\n- Got it.\n- Yeah.\nSo it's important to distinguish.\nIt doesn't mean your lifespan\nis going to be 40% less.\nIt means at any point\nin time, standing there,\nyour risk of death is 40% higher.\nAnd, by the way, that'll\ncatch up with you, right?\nAt some point that catches up.\nHigh blood pressure.\nIt's about a 20 to 25% increase\nin all-cause mortality.\nYou take something really extreme,\nlike endstage kidney disease.\nSo these are patients\nthat are on dialysis,\nwaiting for an organ.\nAnd again, there's a\nconfounder there because\nthere's what's the underlying condition\nthat leads you to that.\nIt's, you know, profound\nhypertension, you know,\nsignificant Type II diabetes\nthat's been uncontrolled.\nYou know, that's enormous,\nthat's about 175% increase in ACM.\nSo the hazard ratio is like 2.75.\nType II diabetes is probably\nabout a 1.25 as well.\nSo a 25% increase.\nSo another question is\nlike, how do you improve?\nSo what are the things that improve those?\nSo now here we do this by\ncomparing low to high achievers\non other metrics.\nSo if you look at low muscle\nmass versus high muscle mass,\nwhat is the improvement?\nAnd it's pretty significant.\nIt's about three X.\nSo if you compare low muscle mass people\nto high muscle mass people as they age,\nthe low muscle mass people have about\na three X hazard ratio, or 200% increase\nin all-cause mortality.\nNow, if you look at the\ndata more carefully,\nyou realize that it's probably less\nthe muscle mass fully doing that,\nand it's more the high\nassociation with strength.\nAnd when you start to\njust tease out strength,\nyou can realize that\nstrength could be probably\n3 1/2 X as a hazard ratio,\nmeaning about 250% greater risk,\nif you have low strength to high strength.\n- And high strength is\nthe ability to move loads\nat 80 to 90% of one repetition?\n- It's all defined by given studies.\nSo, the most common things\nthat are used are actually,\nthey're used for the\npurposes of experiments\nthat make it easy to do.\nAnd I don't even think\nthey're the best metrics.\nSo they're usually using like\ngrip strength, leg extensions,\nand like wall sits,\nsquats, things like that.\nSo how long can you sit in a\nsquatted position at 90 degrees\nwithout support,\nwould be a great demonstration\nof quad strength.\nA leg extension, you know,\nhow much weight can you hold\nfor how long, relative to\nbody weight, things like that.\nYou know, we have a whole\nstrength program that we do\nwith our patients, we have\nsomething called the SMA.\nSo it's the strength metrics assessment.\nAnd we put them through 11\ntests that are really difficult,\nyou know, like a dead hang is one of them.\nLike how long can you dead\nhang your body weight,\nstuff like that.\nSo we're trying to be more\ngranular in that insight,\nbut tie it back to these principles.\nIf you look at cardio respiratory fitness,\nit's even more profound.\nSo if you look at people\nwho are in the bottom 25%\nfor their age and sex,\nin terms of VO2 max,\nand you compare them to\nthe people that are just at\nthe 50th to 75th percentile,\nyou're talking about a\ntwo X difference roughly,\nin the risk of ACM.\nIf you compare the bottom\n25% to the top 2.5%,\nso you're talking about\nbottom quarter to the\nelite, for a given age,\nyou're talking about five X.\n- Wow!\n- 400% difference\nin all-cause mortality.\nThat's probably the single\nstrongest association I've seen\nfor any modifiable behavior.\n- Incredible.\nSo when you say elite,\nthese are people that\nare running marathons\nat a pretty rapid clip.\n- Not necessarily.\nIt's just like what the\nVO2 max is for that,\nlike my VO2 max would be in\nthe elite for my age group.\nMy VO2, but again, I'm\ntraining very deliberately\nto make sure that it's in that.\nSo I wouldn't consider myself\nelite at anything anymore,\nbut I still maintain a VO2\nmax that is elite for my age.\n- I consider you an elite\nphysician and podcaster.\nAnd guy all around.\nBut true.\nBut in terms of, okay, so-\n- But the point is like,\nyou don't have to be a world class athlete\nto be elite here, yeah.\n- Got it.\nSo maybe we could talk a little bit about\nthe specifics around the\ntraining to get into the\ntop two tiers there,\nbecause it seems that those\nare enormous positive effects\nof cardiovascular exercise,\nfar greater than the sorts\nof numbers that I see around,\nlet's just say supplement\nA or supplement B.\n- Well, and that's, you know,\nlike this is my whole\npet peeve in life, right?\nIt's like, I just can't get enough\nof the machinating and arguing\nabout this supplement\nversus that supplement.\nAnd I feel like you shouldn't\nbe having those arguments\nuntil you have your exercise\nhouse in order, you know.\nYou shouldn't be arguing about\nthis nuance if you're carnivore diet,\nversus this nuance if you're paleo diet,\nversus this nuance if you're vegan diet,\nlike, until you can deadlift\nyour body weight for 10 reps.\nLike then you can come and\ntalk about those things,\nor something like, let's just\ncome up with some metrics.\nLike until your VO2 max is at\nleast to the 75th percentile\nand you're able to dead\nhang for at least a minute,\nand you're able to wall\nsit for at least two,\nlike we could rattle off a bunch of\nrelatively low hanging fruit.\nI wish there was a rule that said like\nyou couldn't talk about\nanything else health-related.\n- We can make that rule.\n- [Peter] No one'll listen to it.\n- I don't know about that.\nWe can make whatever rules we want.\nWe can call it Attia's rule.\nOne thing I've done\nbefore on this podcast,\nand on social media is,\njust borrowing from the\ntradition in science,\nwhich is it's inappropriate\nto name something\nafter yourself, unless you\nwere a scientist before 1950.\nBut it's totally\nappropriate to name things\nafter other people.\nSo I'm going to call it Attia's rule.\nUntil you can do the following\nthings, don't talk about\nsupplements.\n- Please refrain\nfrom talking about\nsupplements and nutrition.\n- There it is, hereafter,\nthought of, referred to,\nand referenced as Attia's rule.\nI coined the phrase, not him.\nSo there's no ego involved,\nbut it is now Attia's rule.\nWatch out.\nHashtag Attia's rule.\n- Oh God!\n- Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule.\nIn all seriousness, and\nI am serious about that.\nDead hang for about a minute\nseems like a really good goal\nfor a lot of people.\nAt least-\n- That's our goal.\nI think we have a minute\nand a half is the goal\nfor a 40-year-old woman.\nTwo minutes is the goal\nfor a 40-year-old man.\nSo we adjust them up and\ndown, based on age and gender.\n- Great.\nAnd then the wall sit,\nwhat are some numbers?\n- We don't use a wall sit,\nwe do just a straight squat,\nair squat at 90 degrees.\nAnd I believe two minutes is the standard\nfor both men and women at 40.\n- Great.\nAnd then, because for some\npeople thinking in terms\nof VO2 max is a little more complicated,\nthey might not have access to\nthe equipment to measure it,\net cetera, what can we\ntalk about, think about,\nin terms of cardiovascular.\nSo run a mile at seven minutes or less,\neight minutes or less?\n- Oh, that's a good question.\nSo there are really good\nVO2 max estimators online,\nand you can plug in your activity de jure,\nso be it a bike, run, or rowing machine,\nand it can give you a sense of that.\nAnd I don't, I used to know all of those.\n- Oh, that's okay.\n- But now that I just\nactually do the testing,\nI don't recall them.\nBut it's exactly that line of thinking,\nlike, can you run a mile in this time.\nIf you can, your VO2 max\nis approximately this.\n- [Andrew] Great.\n- And I think, somewhere\nin my podcast realm,\nI've got all those charts posted of like,\nthis is by age, by sex.\nThis is what the VO2 max is\nin each of those buckets.\n- Terrific, we'll provide links to those.\nWe'll have our people find those links.\nAnd then you mentioned\ndeadlifting body weight 10 times.\n- I just made that one up.\nThat's not one that we include, but-\n- [Andrew] Something like that?\n- We use farmer carries.\nSo we'll say for a male,\nyou should be able to farmer\ncarry your body weight for,\nI think we have two minutes.\n- [Andrew] Great.\n- So that's half your\nbody weight in each hand.\nYou should be able to walk\nwith that for two minutes.\nFor women, I think we're\ndoing 75% of body weight\nor something like that, yeah.\n- Great.\nI love it.\nAs indirect measures of how healthy and,\n- Yeah.\n- we are.\nAnd how long we're going to live.\n- It's basically grip\nstrength, it's mobility.\nI mean, again, walking\nwith that much weight,\nfor some people initially, is really hard.\nYou know, we use different\nthings like vertical jump,\nground contact time if\nyou're jumping off a box,\nthings like that.\nSo it's really trying to capture,\nand it's an evolution, right?\nLike I think the test is going to get\nonly more and more involved\nas we get involved,\n'cause it took us about a year.\nBeth Lewis did the majority\nof the work to develop this.\nBeth runs our strength\nand stability program\nin the practice.\nAnd, you know, basically I\njust tasked her with like, hey,\ngo out to the literature and come up with\nall of the best movements\nthat we think are proxies\nfor what you need to be\nlike the most kick-ass,\nyou know, what we call\ncentenarian decathlete,\nwhich is the person living\nin their marginal decade\nat the best.\n- Well, what I'm about to say is certainly\na mechanistic leap,\nbut if you look at the literature on\nexercise-related neurogenesis in mice,\nor brain atrophy or brain\nhypertrophy, et cetera,\nin animal models,\nit's very clear that the best\nway to get a nervous system\nto atrophy, to lose\nneurons, shrink neurons,\nand or lose connections between neurons,\nis to stop that animal from moving.\nOr to de-enrich its environment,\ndeprive it of some sensory input\nor multiple sensory inputs.\nAnd the best way to enhance\nthe size of neurons,\nthe number of connections between neurons,\nand maybe even the number of neurons,\nis to enrich its environment\nand get it moving\nwhile enriching that environment.\n- You know, Andrew, I think\nit's very difficult for me\nto say that the same\nis not true in humans.\nAnd so the first time this\nbecame clear to me was in 2014,\nI had an analyst, Dan\nPelletier, and I said, Dan,\nI'm going to give you a project\nthat is vexing me to no end,\nwhich is, I want you to look\nat all of the literature\nthat we have, both mechanistic\nand clinical trial data,\nthat talks about Alzheimer's prevention.\nAnd I want to know every\nsingle type of input.\nAnd I want to have a clear sense of\nvia what mechanism does it\noffer what mode of protection?\nAnd it took Dan, and this was obviously,\nwe iterated a lot on this together.\nAnd he came back with kind\nof an amazing presentation\nthat took, I don't know, nine\nmonths to a year of work.\nAnd what amazed me was when\nhe came back to it, he said,\nthe single greatest efficacy\nwe can point to is exercise.\nAnd I was like Dan, that's\ngot to be nonsense, dude.\nThere's no way exercise is the\nsingle best thing you can do\nfor the brain.\nThere has to be some drug you've missed.\nThere has to be some other\nthing that you've missed.\nAnd he's like, no, like this\nis hands down the best thing\n'cause you're, you know,\nit's not just what it's doing to BDNF.\nIt's not just what it's doing\nto vascular endothelium.\nIt's not just what it's\ndoing to glucose disposal\nand insulin signaling\nand all these things.\nIt's just touching every\naspect of the brain.\nAnd I was very skeptical\nfor about six months,\nkind of really pushed\non him and I was like,\nI think you're missing something, Dan,\nI think you're missing something.\nAnd then finally in the end,\nlooped in Richard Isaacson,\nwho's a neurologist that\nwe work with really closely\non Alzheimer's prevention.\nAnd you know, ultimately\nit turned into a paper\nthat we wrote basically,\nyou know, about this topic,\nand a few others.\n'Cause again, I thought, oh,\nare you sure it's not EPA and DHA?\nLike that's got to have a bigger impact.\nAnd again, there are a lot of\nthings that I think do matter\nand there's a whole host\nof things that we do\nfor Alzheimer's prevention.\nBut I think you're absolutely right.\nThere's not one thing\nthat I'll tell patients\nis more important than exercising.\nAnd by the way,\nit's not the sort of pathetic\nrecommendations that are made.\nLike it's, you have to exercise a lot more\nif you want to get this maximum benefit.\nYou will get, you know,\nthe maximum benefit comes\ngoing from nothing to something.\nSo if you go from being\ncompletely sedentary\nto doing 15 MET hours per week,\nyou'll get probably a\n50% reduction in risk.\n- Wow.\n- So a MET hour,\na MET, just for people who don't know,\nis a metabolic equivalent.\nSo we're exerting about 1.3\nMETs sitting here talking.\nIf we were sitting here being quiet,\nit would be about one MET.\nWalking really briskly\nwould be about five METs.\nSo 15 MET hours per week would be\nthree one hour really brisk walks.\nThat's not a lot of work.\nBut just going from doing\nnothing to doing that\nwould give you 50% of the\nbenefit that you would get\nfrom going all the way.\nNow I, again, I think, I'm\npersonally a little skeptical of\nhow much that's, I think it's\nprobably a bit less than that.\nI think there's more upside\nthan people appreciate.\nBut the studies, I don't\nthink, can truly capture that.\nBut look, you know, there's\nno reason to not be exercising\nmore than that, and capture more benefit,\neven though the rate at\nwhich you accrue it is less.\nAnd it also speaks to the\nhealth span side of this,\nwhich is not necessarily\ncaptured in those data.\nThe health span gets back to\nthe functional piece we\nopened with, which is\nwhat do you want to be doing\nin your marginal decade?\nDo you want to be able to\npick up a great-grandkid,\nif they come running at you?\nDo you want to be able\nto get up off the floor?\nDo you want to be able to\nplay on the floor with a kid\nand then get up on your own?\n- And I think most people are\nthinking final years of life,\nthey're trying to think, you know,\nhow can they take\nthemselves to the bathroom?\nThey're thinking, how can\nthey sit up off the toilet?\nI mean you have like really base,\nvegetative type functions,\nright, at some level.\nI love this, again, this\nidea of marginal decade\nand using that as a way to back cast,\nto actual methods and\nbehaviors and protocols\nthat one should be doing on a daily basis.\nI'll use anecdata, as it's now called,\nto cite just, I know\nthree Nobel prize winners,\nwhich doesn't mean anything\nexcept that they did beautiful work.\nBut the point is that\nthey're all in their 90s.\nSo I'll name them 'cause\nI'm complimenting them\nfor what they've done.\nNot just their work, but\nwhat I'm about to describe.\nSo Eric Kandel at Columbia.\nNobel prize winner for work on memory.\nTorsten Wiesel, work on neuroplasticity.\nAnd then Richard Axel,\nwho's also at Columbia,\nNobel prize winning work\nfor molecular biology\nof smelling and molecular\nbiology generally.\nAll three of them still alive,\nRichard's younger\ncompared to the other two.\nAll three of them either\nswim, jog, or play tennis,\nor racquetball I think is Richard's thing,\nmultiple times per week.\nThey're all cognitively\nstill extremely sharp,\nstill interested in the\narts, doing science,\ncurious about science,\nrunning laboratories,\nwriting books, going on podcasts.\nI mean, it's incredible.\nAgain, that's anecdata.\nBut I was kind of surprised to learn that\ncolleagues that were so\nintellectually strong\nwere also so obsessed with exercise.\nI mean, they really are obsessed\nwith their exercise routine\nand early on linked that to their,\nsome of their intellectual\nvigor over time.\nI want to just also use\nthat as a jumping off point\nto ask about one kind of\nniche thing, but it comes up.\nI don't think I'm going to out\nwhich one of those told me this,\nbut one of those three individuals\nchews an excessive amount of Nicorette.\nUsed to be a smoker and I asked\nhim why and he said because,\nin his estimation,\nit's protective against\nParkinson's and Alzheimer's,\nor at least the\nnicotinic acetylcholine\naugmentation of nicotine,\n'cause nicotine is an\nacetylcholine receptor obviously,\nis known to create a state of\nfocus and neural enhancement.\nWhat are your thoughts about\nnot smoking, let's just,\nI just want to be really clear,\npeople, don't smoke nicotine,\nvape nicotine, it's going\nto shorten your life.\nJust terrible idea, addictive,\net cetera, in my opinion.\nBut what are your thoughts\nabout augmenting acetylcholine,\nthrough the use of nicotine,\nin order to keep the\nbrain healthy and focused?\nAgain, this is one Nobel prize winner,\nso it's truly N of one,\nbut he's so convinced\nthat this matches up with\nthe mechanistic data on\nacetylcholine and cognition,\nthat I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.\n- So I can't speak to the AD\nprevention component of it.\nI'd have to run that by\na couple of my colleagues\nwho I collaborate with on that.\nBut I can definitely speak to\nthe cognitive enhancement piece of it.\nAnd I actually did an AMA on\nthis, probably a year ago,\nwhere I went into all of\nthe gory details of it\nand talked about my own use of nicotine,\nwhich I'll cycle on and off,\nI've been doing it for the last 10 years.\nI haven't-\n- What form do you take it in?\n- I used to use the gum.\nI don't like the gum anymore,\nso now I like these little lozenges that,\nand I'll tell you a\nfunny story about this.\nSo our mutual acquaintance,\nDavid Sinclair,\nmentioned a company to me a year ago.\nHe's like, hey, have you\nheard of this company?\nAnd I forget the name of the company,\nbut he gave me some name.\nSo I go online and it's like\nthis company selling nicotine.\nAnd I'm like, I wonder why\nhe's asking me to do this.\nWell, I'll just order a bunch\nand then we'll figure out\nwhy, 'cause we were, you know,\nthere was some reason we were doing this\npotentially through investment.\nSo I get a, like literally\norder like a lifetime supply\nof this stuff.\nAnd it's pretty good, it's actually,\nit's a really nice little patch, 'cause I,\nthe thing I didn't like about the gum was\nI hated just the taste of it.\nSo then the next week I'm\ntalking to David and I'm like,\nby the way, I ordered\nall that nicotine stuff\nyou told me about.\nHe's like what?\nAnd he goes, oh, the company's\nname was something else.\nIt was totally unrelated.\nIt's like, oh God.\nSo the short answer is, I\nthink this stuff is absolutely\na concentration-enhancing substance.\nIt is addictive and people\nneed to be wary of that.\nNow it's not addictive to everybody.\nI personally experience no\naddiction to it whatsoever.\nSo I can, I could do it\nevery day for 30 days\nand stop and experience no withdrawal.\nI could forget about it, it\ndoesn't really seem to matter.\nYou have to be careful\nwith the dose, truthfully.\nI mean, remember one cigarette is about\none milligram of nicotine,\nand a lot of these lozenges will plow\nfour to eight milligrams\ninto you in one shot.\nAnd for someone who is, you\nknow, naive to that, like I am,\nfour milligrams is a lot\nof nicotine in one bolus.\nSo you just have to be very mindful of it.\nI got a lot of flack when I did this AMA,\nfor obvious reasons, but\npeople were like, how can you,\nas a doctor, encourage\npeople to use nicotine.\nAnd I was like, first of all,\nI'm not encouraging anybody to use it.\nI just want to be able to talk\nabout the biochemistry of it.\nAnd if disclosing that I\nuse it from time to time\nis an endorsement then\nI apologize for that.\nBut on the list of things that you can do\nto make your brain a little more focused,\nI would consider this infinitely safer\nthan what a lot of people are doing,\nwhich is using stimulants.\nI mean, to me, you know, I\njust tell patients outright,\nlike we are under no circumstance\nprescribing stimulants.\nI mean, yeah, we're not\ngiving anybody Adderall.\nWe're not giving anybody\nVyvanse, or any of these things.\nNot to say they don't have\nan appropriate clinical use,\nbut they should be prescribed\nunder the care of somebody\nwho's really monitoring\nthe use case for it.\nAnd using that as a tool\nto enhance, you know,\nconcentration in cognitive performance\nis not something we're comfortable doing.\n- Yeah, it's rampant on college campuses.\n- [Peter] I can only imagine.\n- Armodafinil, modafinil\nwhich are slightly different,\nof course, but, so non-clinical use,\nnot prescribed for ADHD,\nbut just, it's rampant.\nRecreational use, study-based use.\n- But the data I've seen on modafinil\nsuggests that it only really\nprovides a nootropic benefit.\nin someone who is deprived of sleep.\nIs there data that in a\ntotally well-rested person,\nthere is a nootropic benefit of modafinil?\n- I don't know.\nI have one experience with armodafinil,\nwhere I took a half a recommended dose,\nthis was prescribed by a doctor.\nI went to give a talk.\nThis was in Hawaii and I'm\nfour hours into the talk.\nMy co-speaker came up to\nme and just said, well,\nfirst of all, you got a little bit of spit\nin the corner of your mouth.\nAnd second of all, you haven't\nblinked in three minutes.\nAnd third, there's only two\npeople left in the audience.\nI was so lazered in that\nI kind forgot the context.\nNow I'm a little bit of a,\nkind of a tunnel vision,\nOCD-type anyway, but one,\nthat was all it took,\nI never took any more of it.\nIt was a powerful stimulant.\nI take 300 milligrams of\nAlpha-GPC now and again,\nbefore some cognitive work,\nsometimes before workouts,\nand I do subjectively feel\nthat it narrows my focus\nin a nice way.\nBut I don't take it more\nthan once or twice a day,\nand more than once or twice a week.\n- See, this is an example of where,\nyou know how we're talking\nabout exercise versus\nsort of nutrition and\nsupplements for longevity.\nI think there may be a\nwhole bunch of things\nthat are kind of interesting around focus,\nbut nothing would compare\nto changing our environment.\nLike I think that if I\ncompare my focus today\nto my focus when I was in\ncollege, there's no comparison.\nLike in college, I was truly a robot.\nBut I think a large part of it was,\nthere was no distraction.\nThere's no email.\nThere's no social media.\nThere's no internet.\nI mean, I was in college\nwhen Mosaic launched\nin the early '90s.\nLike I, you know, and you\nhad to walk like a mile\nto get to the computer lab\non a big Sun workstation\nto do anything in, you know,\nsome computer code language.\nSo when you're sitting\nin your room studying,\nthere was no distraction.\nAnd I think that's a far greater component\nof what it means to be focused,\nthan the challenges we have today.\nSo, you know, my thoughts\non this would be,\nif we really wanted to\nreturn to a state of focus,\nwe're going to have to\nindividually do something about,\nyou know, our environment.\nAnd I don't know what the answer is.\nLike, I've tried every\nlittle trick I can think of,\nlike closing my browsers\nwhen I'm writing and stuff,\nbut, you know, I'm just\nnot strong enough willed.\nLike I'll pick up my\nphone every 20 minutes\nto look and see if I missed a text message\nor something stupid.\n- That's pretty infrequent.\nI did an episode on habits\nand looking at the data.\nIt seems that people\nare getting interrupted\nor interrupting themselves\nabout once every three minutes\nin the typical workplace,\nnow that typical has changed\nwith a lot more people working at home.\nI do put my phone away\nwhen I try and work,\nbut nothing focuses me like a deadline.\nA little bit of fear-based urgency.\nThat's it, grant deadlines, you know,\ndrop deadlines as I call them,\nor podcasts we're going to record today,\nthat nothing works quite like it.\nBut such is life.\nWell, thanks for that\noffshoot about nicotine.\nAgain, you're not recommending\nit, I'm not recommending it,\nbut it's clear that augmenting\nthe acetylcholine system,\nwhich is what nicotine\ndoes in its various forms,\nand some related type pharmacology,\ndoes enhance focus and pretty potently.\nSo I think it's going to\nbe an interesting area\nfor real clinical trials\nand things of that sort.\nLove to chat about hormone therapies,\nand hormones generally.\nWhen Robert Sapolsky came on the podcast,\nwe talked a little bit about menopause\nand the data around menopause.\nHe's very interested\nin these findings that,\nI think I'm going to get this right,\nthat whether or not women\nbenefit from estrogen therapy\nto offset menopause\nreally depends on when\nthat therapy is initiated.\nI don't know if you're\naware of those data,\nbut he claimed that if\nthey begin estrogen therapy\nin the middle to tail end of menopause,\nthe outcomes can be quite bad.\nWhereas if they initiate\nthose estrogen therapies\nas they enter menopause\nor even before menopause,\nthen the outcomes can be quite good.\nI don't know what percentage\nof the patients you treat\nare male versus female,\nand what ages those\npatients are of course,\nbut what are your thoughts about\nestrogen therapy for women,\nmenopause, and hormone\ntherapies generally for women,\nmaybe even testosterone therapy,\nyou hear about that these days,\nand then we'll talk about men.\n- So our practice is\nprobably 70 30 male female.\nSo we have lots of women,\nand this is a very important topic.\nIt's also probably, let me think.\nI just want to make sure\nI'm not being hyperbolic\nwhen I say this.\nYeah, I don't think I am.\nIt's hands down the biggest screw up\nof the entire medical\nfield in the last 25 years.\nNow, again, it's possible in\nthe next hour I'll think of,\nnope, there's a bigger screw up.\n- Another giant screw up.\n- Yeah, but I don't think I will.\nI'm pretty confident that\nI won't be able to think of\na bigger act of incompetence\nthan what happened with the\nwomen's health initiative\nin the late '90s and early 2000s,\nwhich is effectively the study\nthat turned the entire medical field\noff hormone replacement therapy for women.\nSo it's important, I think,\nto explain what this study looked at.\nSo this was a study that was conducted\nin response to the widely held\nbelief in the '70s and '80s\nthat women should be placed on hormones\nas they're going through menopause, right?\nMenopause is, I guess maybe\nI'll even take a step back.\nI don't know how much your\naudience is familiar with\nhow estrogen progesterone work.\nIs it worth going into that stuff?\n- Yeah probably worth mentioning\na bit of the top contour.\nSome of them might be familiar with it,\nwe've done episodes on estrogen\ntestosterone, but frankly,\nas I think back to those,\nwe didn't really go into the biology\nof estrogen testosterone enough.\n- Yeah, so, I mean, actually\nan interesting aside\nthat I always tell my female patients\nwho get a kick out of this.\nWhen you look at a woman's\nlabs, you'll see her estrogen,\nher progesterone, her FSH,\nher LH, her testosterone,\nher sex hormone binding\nglobulin, and all these things.\nBut based on the units\nthey're reported in,\nit's a very distorting picture\nof what the most common\nandrogen is in her body.\nIf you actually convert\nthem to the same units,\nshe has much more testosterone\nin her body than estrogen.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah.\n- I did not know that.\n- Yeah.\n- Then again, I've never been a woman\ngetting my hormone profile.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nSo even though a woman's testosterone\nis much less than a man's level,\nit's still more than she\nhas estrogen in her body.\n- [Andrew] Wow!\n- So phenotypically, right,\nestrogen is the hormone\nthat's dominating and test,\nso it's the, she has much\nhigher estrogen than a man\nand much lower testosterone than a man,\nbut in absolute amounts,\nshe has more testosterone than estrogen.\nJust worth pointing that out.\n- [Andrew] Incredible.\n- So, you know, what's\nhappening to a woman\nfrom the age she starts menstruating\nuntil she goes through menopause,\noutside of pregnancy and birth\ncontrol and stuff like that,\nis she has this cycle, you\nknow, roughly every 28 days,\nbut it can vary, where at\nthe beginning of her period,\nwe call that day zero, her basic,\nher estrogen and\nprogesterone are very low.\nYou can't measure them.\nAnd then what happens is the\nestrogen level starts to rise,\nand it rises in response\nto a hormone called\nfollicle stimulating hormone, FSH,\nthat is getting her ready to ovulate.\nAnd she ovulates at about\nthe midpoint of her cycle.\nSo if we're just going\nto make the math easy,\non day 14 she's going\nto release a follicle\nfrom one of her ovaries.\nAnd the estrogen level is sort\nof rising, rising, rising.\nWe love to measure hormones on day five,\nbecause I want to have a standardized way\nin which I measure her hormones.\nSo our women know if we're in the business\nof trying to understand her hormones,\nthe day her period starts,\neven if it's just a day of spotting,\nthat becomes our benchmark,\nand then day five,\nI want to see every hormone on that day.\nAnd if everything is going well,\nI know what her FSH, LH,\nestradiol and progesterone\nshould be on that day.\nSo the estrogen rises, starts\nto come down a little bit\nas she ovulates, and then the\nluteinizing hormone kicks on\nbecause it's now going\nto prepare her uterus\nfor the lining to accommodate a pregnancy.\nSo now you start to see estradiol go back,\nbut now, for the first\ntime, progesterone goes up.\nSo progesterone has been\ndoing nothing for 14 days,\nand now it starts to rise.\nAnd actually progesterone is the hormone\nthat's dominating the second half,\nwhich is called her luteal cycle.\nSo the first 14 days is\nthe follicular cycle.\nSecond is the luteal cycle.\nSo once you get to about\nthe halfway point of that,\nwhich is now, just to\ndo the math, 21 days in,\nthe body has figured out\nif she's pregnant or not.\nAnd again, most of the time\nshe's not going to be pregnant.\nSo the body says, oh,\nI don't need this lining\nthat I've been preparing,\nI'm going to shed it.\nSo now progesterone and\nestrogen start crashing,\nand the lining is what is being shed,\nand that is the menses.\nBy the way, it's that last\nseven days of that cycle,\nthat in a susceptible\nwoman is what creates\nthose PMS symptoms.\nSo it's the, actually, this is something\nthat you would probably have\na better understanding of than me.\nThere is something about\nthis in a susceptible woman,\nwhere the enormous reduction\nof progesterone so quickly\nis probably impacting\nsomething in her brain.\nSo this is a legitimate thing, right?\nI mean, you know, it's not like,\noh, she's crazy because she's\nhaving all these PMS symptoms.\nNo.\nWe know that that's the case\nbecause if you put women on progesterone\nfor those seven days,\nthose symptoms go away.\n- [Andrew] Interesting.\n- So if you can stabilize\ntheir progesterone\nduring the last half\nof their luteal phase,\nand sometimes we would just do it\nfor the entire luteal phase,\njust put them on a low\ndose of progesterone,\nall PMS symptoms vanish.\n- Very interesting.\nI'll have to look up where\nthe progesterone receptors\nare located in the brain.\nThe Allen Brain Institute\nnow has beautiful data of\nin situ hybridization, which for,\n'cause they don't understand is,\nlooking at RNA and sort of\nwhere genes and proteins\nought to be expressed in the human brain,\nby using actual human\nbrain tissue sections\nas opposed to just mice.\nSo I'll take a look, I think-\n- Yeah, I'm really\ncurious, yeah.\n- Some insight into what that\nprogesterone emotionality link might be,\nand where it might exist,\nneural circuit wise.\n- So then, when the\nestrogen and progesterone\nreach their nadir again,\nthat starts the cycle.\nSo that just, that cycle is happening\nover and over and over again.\nOkay, so it became well\nknown in the '50s that, okay,\na woman's going to stop\nmenstruating at some point,\nher estrogen goes down.\nWhy don't we just give her estrogen?\n'Cause that's clearly going to help\nwith some of the symptoms of menopause.\nSo what do women experience\nwhen they go through menopause?\nThe first symptoms are what\nare called vasomotor symptoms.\nSo this is usually in the form\nof night sweats, hot flashes.\nSo, and depending on the woman,\nthis can be really significant, right?\nThese are women who can\nhave a hard time sleeping.\nThey can be having hot flashes\nduring the middle of the day.\nThey can wake up soaked\nin a pool of sweat.\nThose tend to pass\nafter a couple of years,\nand then they get into sort of the more\nlong-term complications of menopause.\nSo what we call vaginal\natrophy, vaginal dryness,\nand then the stuff that we\ntalked about a while ago,\nwhich is the osteopenia osteoporosis.\nA lot of women will complain of brain fog.\nSo, I mean, clearly this was an issue\nand it was recognized 70 years ago.\nWhy don't we give women estrogen back\nto replace that hormone?\nAnd so that went on for a\ncouple of decades, maybe less,\nmaybe a decade, and then it\nwas realized, wait a minute,\nwe were driving up the\nrisk of uterine cancer.\nAnd the reason for that is\nif you just give estrogen\nwith no progesterone to antagonize it,\nyou will thicken the endometrium endlessly\nand you will increase\nthe risk of hyperplasia.\nWell, you'll definitely\nundergo hyperplasia,\nand then ultimately dysplasia.\nDysplasia is precancerous,\nand ultimately we were seeing that.\nSo people figured out, well, actually,\nif you want to give estrogen to a woman\nwho still has her uterus,\nyou have to give her progesterone as well.\nYou have to be able to have a hormone\nto oppose the estrogen.\nAnd then that became effectively\nin, call it the 1970s-ish,\nthe standard for HRT.\nSo in the early 1990s the NIH said, look,\nwe haven't really studied this.\nWe have a ton of epidemiology that says\ngiving women hormones seems to\nbe doing really good things.\nThey feel better, so all\ntheir symptoms go away.\nThey seem to have lower\nrisk of heart disease,\nlower risk of, you know,\ncardiovascular, pardon me,\nlower risk of cardiovascular disease,\nlower risk of bone fractures.\nEverything seems to get better.\nLower risk of diabetes.\nBut we haven't tested this\nin a randomized prospective\ntrial, so let's do this.\nSo that became the WHI.\nAnd it randomized, it\nhad two parallel arms.\nSo it had a group for women\nwho did not have a uterus.\nSo these are women that\nhad undergone hysterectomy\nfor some other reason.\nAnd then it had a group for women\nthat did have their uterus.\nIn the first group,\nthere was a placebo arm\nand then an estrogen only arm.\nAnd in the other group,\nthere was a progesterone plus\nestrogen versus a placebo.\nEverything about the way this\nstudy was done is a bit wonky.\nSome of it is justifiable, but\nit's important to understand.\nFirst, the women were all\nway outside of menopause.\nSo none of these women were started\nwhen you would normally start HRT.\nAnd there were probably\nseveral reasons for that,\nbut one of them is, and I think\nthis is a legitimate reason,\nthey wanted hard outcomes.\nThey wanted to know death rates.\nAnd if you're doing this\non women in their 50s,\nyou just weren't going to get it, right.\nYou couldn't-\n- Wait too long.\n- Yeah,\nyou got to wait too long.\nAnd this was only going to be\nlike a seven to 10-year study.\nSo they had to do this on\nwomen who were much older.\nThey also disproportionately\ntook much sicker women.\nI believe the prevalence, and again,\nI'm going to get some\nof these numbers wrong\nand people are going to get all\nphosphorylated, but, you know,\nI mean, I'm in the ballpark, right?\nSomething like 30, 40% of\nthese women were smokers.\nThe prevalence of obesity,\ndiabetes was enormous.\nSo they really disproportionately picked\nthe most unhealthy population they could,\nthat was pretty advanced in age.\nAnd again, I think part\nof that was to say, look,\nwe want to make sure\nthat after seven years,\nwe really know if there's a difference\nin these causes of death.\nThe other thing is, this is kind of weird,\nalthough again, I understand\ntheir rationale for it,\nbut this is a great\nexample of be very careful\nwhen you look at a clinical trial,\nthat it remotely represents the patients\nyou're interested in treating.\nSo they also treated no\npatients who were symptomatic.\nThe rationale being, if\nwe include in the study\npatients who are symptomatic,\nthose who are randomized\nto placebo will drop out.\n- Okay, it makes sense\nin terms of study design,\nmakes no sense if the study\ndesign is intended to mimic\nthe real world.\n- That's right.\nSo now let's just keep\ntrack of the three issues.\nWe have a disproportionately\nunhealthy patient population\nwho are not symptomatic,\nand we're starting them more\nthan 10 years after menopause.\nThe next thing that they did, which again,\nI understand why they did it,\nbut it's now the fourth\nstrike against this study, is,\nand I've spoken with the PI of the study\nand asked this question point blank.\nI'm actually going to have her\non my podcast at some point soon\nto go over this in more detail,\nis why did you use conjugated\nequine estrogen, an MPA,\nwhich is a synthetic form of progesterone.\n- [Andrew] Horse-\n- Yes.\n- estrogen?\n- It's horse urine, is\nthey collect horse urine,\nso they're getting, it's-\n- Horses do urinate a lot.\nOr at least when they urinate,\nit seems like a large volume of urine,\nfrom what I've observed.\n- [Peter] You have a lot\nof experience with this?\n- No, but, you know,\nmy sister rode horses for a little while,\nmy high school girlfriend\nhad a horse, and that thing,\nI mean the pees were legendary.\nIt's a male horse.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- So, yeah, so the\nconjugated equine estrogen\nis the estrogen that's\ncollected from female horses.\nAnd then it's a synthetic progesterone.\nAnd I said to the person, I said, well,\nwhy didn't you use what we use today,\nwhich is bio-identical\nestrogen in progesterone.\nLike today, when we put\nwomen on estrogen, we use a,\nit's an FDA product\ncalled the Vivelle-Dot.\nSo it's a patch that you just\nput on, and it's estradiol,\nbut it's bioidentical estradiol.\nAnd we use what's called\nmicronized progesterone.\nSo bio-identical progesterone.\nAnd she said, well, at the\ntime we just wanted to test\nwhat was currently being used.\nAnd I said, totally makes sense.\nBut again, now you have\nfour considerations\nthat you have to keep in mind, okay.\nSo despite those four considerations,\nand I'm going to make a case\nfor you why I think the MPA\ncreated a real problem in that study,\nthe synthetic progesterone,\nwhen the preliminary results\nwere first made available,\nbut not yet peer-reviewed\nand not yet published,\nthere was a huge fiasco, huge\npress announcement about it,\nsuggesting that the women\nreceiving the CEE plus MPA,\nin the group with the uterus,\nhad a higher incidence of breast cancer.\nAnd that basically became the\nheadline that never went away,\nthough it turned out not to be true.\nLet's talk about the numbers.\nWhat was the increase in\nthe risk of breast cancer\nin that group?\nWhich gets to one of my, you know,\nif you ever listen to me on\na podcast rail on something.\n- Listen, I have about 3,800\npet peeves and counting.\nMy laboratory staff know these,\nknow a good number of them.\nSo, you do not have\n- Here, I'll add to\none of them.\n- to apologize\nfor having many pet peeves.\nBecause as long as they\nhave experience in data\nto support them, it provides-\n- So one of my biggest pet\npeeves is, and my team knows this\n'cause sometimes they'll\noccasionally, you know,\nthey'll do this and I'll\nhave to remind them,\nyou never talk about\na relative risk change\nwithout an absolute risk\naccommodating it, right.\nSo, what does that look like?\nSo the relative risk\nincrease of breast cancer\nin the estrogen plus MPA\ngroup versus the placebo\nwas 25, 27%.\nAnd that became the only headline.\nHRT increases risk of\nbreast cancer by 27%.\nNow, I don't think\nthat's true at all today,\nbut let's even look at the data.\nWhat was the ARR?\nWhat was the absolute risk increase?\nIt was a difference between\nfive cases per thousand\nand four cases per thousand.\nSo the ARR was 0.1%,\none case in a thousand.\nAnd it's true, going\nfrom four in a thousand\nto five in a thousand is a 25% increase,\nbut it's a completely\ninappropriate context.\n- I agree, and I feel like\nheadlines of that sort,\nwhich have come up recently around\nvarious dietary interventions,\nwe won't go there,\nat least not for the time being,\nare nothing short of criminal\nbecause they really\ndistort people's thinking.\nBut also they steer the course\nof science and medicine for,\nas you pointed out, for\ndecades, if not longer.\nAnd they can really take\nus off our health track\nin serious ways.\n- So I'll bring this meandering\nto a close, which is to say,\neven though I could spend the next hour\ntalking about all of the ways\nin which this study was flawed,\nand all of the very unethical\nthings that were done\nby a number of the investigators\nwho went out of their way to\nmask the truth of this study\nfrom the world, I'll tell a woman today,\nwe're going to start you on this\nwhen you're going through menopause.\nWe're using bio-identical hormones.\nAnd if your upper bound\nrisk of breast cancer\nis one case in a thousand,\nyou should at least weigh that against\nall of the other benefits,\nwhich I'll talk about.\nNow, there's something else I want to say,\nbecause a moment ago I\nalluded to the fact that\nI think the MPA might have\nbeen the biggest issue\nin that study.\nSo there were two findings in\nthat study that were negative.\nOne was the small increase\nin the risk of heart disease,\nand the small increase in\nthe risk of breast cancer.\nBut consider the other group,\nwe forgot about the group\nthat didn't have a uterus.\n'Cause remember, those\nwomen got estrogen only\nversus placebo.\nWhat was the difference\nin breast cancer there?\nWell, this is interesting\n'cause it didn't reach\nstatistical significance, but\nits P value was 0.06 or 0.07.\nSo it came very close, but it\nwas in the opposite direction.\nIt was a 24% risk reduction,\nabout one in a thousand as well.\nSo when you had estrogen plus MPA,\nyou had a barely\nstatistically significant,\nthe P value was 0.05,\nso it just hit statistical significance,\none in a thousand cases for breast cancer.\nAnd then you had one in a thousand cases,\nbut P value of 0.07, for reduction\nof risk of breast cancer.\nWhich to me suggests that the MPA,\nthe synthetic progesterone,\nwas playing more of a\nrole than anything else.\nThe second thing I point\nout is oral estrogen,\nwhich we no longer use,\ndoes increase coagulability.\nIt does increase the ability of the blood\nto clot a little bit.\nAnd when we look at the\nmore recent data on HRT,\nusing topical estrogen\nor patches of estrogen,\nwe don't see that at all.\nIn fact, we see the opposite now.\nSo now we see the risk of heart disease\ngoing down in women with estradiol.\n- And some women will be\narriving to those treatments\nwith mutations and things\nlike Factor V Leiden\nand other clotting factors.\nIs it appropriate to say that everyone,\nboth male and female, should\nknow whether or not they have\nmutant forms of Factor V Leiden?\n- You know, we don't typically\ntest people for Factor V.\nMy wife actually has it,\nbut we didn't learn it\nuntil she had HELLP syndrome\ngiving birth to our first daughter.\nBut, you know, we kind of look for\nmore family history reason to\nbe testing things like that.\nWe take a pretty detailed family history,\nso we'll kind of look for\nclotting issues there.\n- What about, so your reflex nowadays\nis to put women on these topical\nestrogen therapies?\n- Well it's to basically\nhave the discussion, right?\nSo here's where we still\nstruggle, right, is, you know,\nif it were up to me, I'd\nprefer for a woman's HRT\nto be provided by her GYN,\nbecause we want to be able to\nwork in partnership with the GYN\nwho we would like to see\nan endometrial ultrasound done every year.\nThat's, you know, some\nwould argue that's overkill,\nbut we think she should\nbe having a pap smear\nevery year as well.\nSo if we're looking at the cervix,\nwe want to look at the endometrium,\nwe want to make sure the\nlining isn't too thick.\nThe other thing I should\nsay, Andrew, is today,\nwe now realize that not all\nwomen can tolerate estro,\npardon me, progesterone.\nSo you have to be careful.\nSo assuming, again, a\nwoman still has her uterus,\nthe estrogen solves most of the problems,\nbut then you have to decide,\ncan she tolerate the progesterone?\nAnd it needs to be, if given systemically\nlike a hundred to 200 milligrams.\nAnd for some women, that is\na lifesaving intervention.\nI mean, they start sleeping\nbetter, their hair gets thicker,\nthey feel better.\nBut for some women, it\nliterally drives them crazy.\nIt's probably the reciprocal\nof what we were seeing\nin the case of women with PMS.\nSo in those situations we say, great,\nwe're done with oral progesterone.\nWe just use a progesterone coated IUD.\nSo then you get the local\nprogesterone in the uterus\nfor protection, and the systemic estrogen.\n- Fascinating.\nWhat about oral contraception in women?\nSo the use of estrogen\nchronically through people's,\nyou know, college years or 20s, 30s,\nmaybe even teens, who knows.\nWhat's known about the\nlong-term effects, if any?\n- I got to be honest with you,\nI don't think I know\nenough to comment on it.\nIt's not something that really impacts\nmy patient population.\nAt least in what I see,\nmore women are using IUDs\nfor contraception than OCs.\nI mean, we use OCs sometimes\nin women who are premenopausal,\nfor symptomatic control,\nbut we'll typically use like\na low low estrin, so a very\nlow synthetic estrogen,\nwhich I don't like using these very much.\nBut if it's the only thing that we can get\nto control certain symptoms,\nand we'll use it like half her cycle.\nBut it's typically not something\nwe're that experienced with.\n- What about testosterone,\nbecause you mentioned that,\nyou know, nanogram per mill,\nwhen you said everything\nto the same, you know,\nI guess it's nanogram per deciliter,\n- Yeah yeah.\n- as it would be\nto kind of normalize\neverything.\n- Versus picogram per ML.\n- Right, yeah.\nAnd so, what Peter was\npointing out before is that\nyou look at your charts\nand they're all in these\ndifferent measures,\nand so when you normalize,\ntestosterone is actually\nhigher than estrogen in women.\nThat's a surprise to me.\nDo you prescribe testosterone\ntherapy to women ever?\n- We do sometimes, but I do\nit with much more caution\nbecause I don't have the data, right.\nSo where I'll, you know,\nwhat we'll say is, look,\nI mean, we're now really\noutside of an area\nwhere I can point to a lot of data.\nLike when it comes to\nestrogen and progesterone,\nI'll happily go toe to toe with anybody\nwho wants to make the\ncase that it's dangerous.\nSimilarly, when it comes to\nusing testosterone in men,\nI'll spend all day, and I can\ngo through that literature\nuntil the other person cries\nand wants to just call uncle, right.\nWhen it comes to-\n- And then you\nprescribe them testosterone.\n- When it comes to estrogen in,\ntestosterone in women,\ndon't have that data.\nAnd I'd love to see that trial done.\nSo what's the sweet spot,\nhow do we reconcile that?\nSo it's not something I consider standard.\nAnd basically, if a woman\nis, if her testosterone,\nfirst of all, is\nstaggeringly low, and again,\neven though her testosterone's\nlow compared to a male,\nwe still have a range.\nSo if it's really at the\nbottom of that range,\nshe's really having difficulty\nputting on muscle mass\nand really complaining of low libido,\nI think in that situation,\nwe'll go ahead and use topical\ntestosterone, and, you know,\nreplace her to a level that is\nstill physiologically normal.\n- Yeah, that's key because\nwhen people hear HRT,\nthey think about, super\nphysiological seems to be the term.\n- Yeah, like I've never\nseen a single symptom\nin a single woman that\nI've put testosterone on,\nin terms of like acne, body\nhair, things like that.\nLike those are real symptoms\nthat you have to be aware of,\nbut, you know, like clitoral enlargement\nand things like that,\nlike that doesn't happen\nunder physiologic normal conditions.\n- I'd love to talk a little bit about\nhormone replacement therapy in men.\nWhen one looks on social\nmedia and the internet,\nthere seems to be a younger\nand younger cohort of guys\nand people in their teens and 20s,\nshowing up to the table\nthinking that injecting\ntestosterone cypionate\nor taking Anavar, whatever it is,\nis going to be the right idea.\nThey mainly seem to be\nfocused on cosmetic effects.\nI'm not a physician, so I\ncan't say whether or not\nthey were actually hypogonadal et cetera,\nbut it seems to me, again,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\nbut it seems to me that\nsimilar to the Attia's rule\nas it relates to longevity,\nthat we could come up\nwith a broad contour rule\nin which if a male of any age\nis not trying to get decent\nsleep, exercise appropriately,\nappropriate nutrition, minding\ntheir social connections,\net cetera, et cetera,\nthe idea of going straight to testosterone\nseems like a bad idea.\nThat said, just like with\ndepression and antidepressants,\nthere is a kind of a cliff after which\nlow enough testosterone,\nor low enough serotonin,\nprevents people from sleeping, exercise,\nsocial connection, et cetera.\nSo I do want to acknowledge that.\nBut with that in mind,\nhow do you think about,\nand perhaps occasionally\nprescribe and direct your patients\nin terms of hormone\nreplacement therapy in men,\nperson in their 30s, person in their 40s,\nwho's doing almost all the\nother things correctly.\nWhat sorts of levels do\nyou think are meaningful?\nBecause the range is tremendous\nin terms of blood tests.\n300 nanograms for deciliter,\nI think on the low end now in the U.S.,\nall the way up to 900 or 1200,\nthat's an enormous range.\nWhat are some of the other\nhormones you like to look at,\nestrogen, DHT and so on?\n- So, a lot to unpack there.\nSo, let's start with the ranges, right?\nSo the ranges you gave\nare for total testosterone, of course,\nand we don't spend a lot\nof time looking at that\nthe way we, you know,\nI used to spend more time\nlooking at total and free\nwhen I used more tricks to modulate it.\nSo I'm actually far more simple\nin my manipulation of testosterone today\nthan I was six or seven years ago.\nSix or seven years ago, I\nmean, we were, you know,\nwe would use a micro dose\nof Anavar to lower SHBG\nin a person who had normal testosterone,\nbut low free testosterone.\n- What was a low dose of\nAnavar in that context?\n- 10 milligrams subling\ntwo to three times a week.\n- Anavar basically being DHT.\nOxandrolone-\n- Yeah, oxandrolone,\nyeah exactly.\n- And again, we're not recommending this.\nThis actually, if you're\nplaying a competitive sport,\ncan get you banned from that sport.\n- No no, yeah yeah.\nThis is-\n- It can also get you banned\nfrom having children if\nyou do it incorrectly.\n- Yeah, so a micro dose of\nthis has to be small enough\nthat it doesn't impair your body's ability\nto make testosterone.\nBut Anavar has such a\nhigh affinity for SHBG,\nthat it basically distracts your SHBG\nfrom binding your testosterone.\n- Freeing up testosterone.\n- That's exactly right.\nSo the goal was, how do I just give you\nmore free testosterone?\nSo if a patient shows up and they've got\na total testosterone of 900\nnanograms per deciliter,\nwhich would place them at, you know,\ndepending on the scale you look at,\nthe scale we look at, that\nwould place you at about\nthe 70th percentile.\nBut your free testosterone is, you know,\neight nanograms per deciliter.\nSo that's pretty bad.\nThat means you're less than 1% free.\nA guy should be about 2% free T.\nSo that dude should be closer to\n16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter.\nSo in that situation that I just gave you,\nhis SHBG is really high.\nHis SHBG is probably\nin the 80 to 90 range.\n- That's very high.\n'Cause I think the upper range\nis somewhere around 55, 56.\n- Exactly.\n- Yeah.\n- So we would first back stall\nfor what's driving his SHBG.\nSo there's basically three hormones,\nso genetics plays a huge role in this.\nThere's no question that\njust out of the box,\npeople have a different\nlike set point for SHBG.\nMine is incredibly low.\nMy SHBG is like kind of\nin the 30s, 20s to 30s.\nBut from a hormone perspective,\nthere's basically three\nhormones that run it.\nSo estradiol being probably\nthe most important,\ninsulin and thyroxine.\nSo we're going to look at all of those\nand decide if any of\nthose are playing a role.\nSo insulin suppresses it.\nSo this is actually the great irony\nof helping a person get\nmetabolically healthy,\nis in the short run,\nyou can actually lower\ntheir free testosterone,\nall things equal.\nBecause as insulin comes\ndown, SHBG goes up,\nand if testosterone\nhasn't gone up with it,\nyou're lowering free testosterone.\n- So somebody who goes on a\nvery low carbohydrate diet\nin an attempt to drop some\nwater and drop some weight,\nis going to increase their SHBG?\n- Yeah, if their insulin\ngoes down enough.\n- Bind up testosterone,\nless free testosterone.\nI can tell the carnivore diet people\nare going to be coming after\nme with bone marrow in hand.\nBut then again,\nafter this discussion\nextends a little further,\nI'm sure the vegans\nwill be coming after me\nwith celery stalks, so it's a.\n- So then the same as with estradiol.\nSo except in the opposite direction.\nSo higher estradiol is higher SHBG.\nSo again, occasionally\nyou'll see a guy with\nnormal testosterone, but he's a very high\naromatase activity person.\nSo he has a lot of the enzyme\nthat converts testosterone into estradiol.\nYou can lower estradiol a bit\nwith an aromatase inhibitor,\nand that can bring down SHBG.\nNow, again, these things\nindividually are rarely enough\nto move the needle.\nThe last is thyroxine.\nSo if you have a person whose\nthyroid is out of whack,\nyou have to fix that before you,\nif their T4 is out of whack,\nyou're going to interfere with SHBG.\nThere are also some supplements\nwhich I think you've\nprobably talked about these\non the podcast.\nI feel like I've heard you talk\nabout these on the podcast.\n- Yeah, there are a few\nthat will adjust, you know,\nthere's this idea now\nthere's a much better review,\nit just came out, I'll send it to you,\nI'd love your thoughts on it,\nand I've been perusing it line by line.\nBut I love input from experts like you\non the use of Tongkat\nAli for reducing SHBG.\nIn my experience, it does\nfree up some testosterone.\nBy which mechanism it isn't exactly clear.\nAnd the effects aren't that dramatic.\nRight, they're probably multiple effects.\nFor all we know, it increases\nlibido, and it does,\ngenerally, by way of\nincreasing estrogen slightly,\nwhich can also increase\nlibido in some individuals.\nSo we don't know the exact mode of action.\nSo we've talked about a few.\nThe one that a few years\nback people were claiming\ncould reduce SHBG was\nstinging nettles.\n- Stinging nettles, yeah.\n- Stinging nettle, well I'll just,\nurinating seems to be\ncoming up multiple times\non this podcast, for whatever reason.\nStinging nettle extract, I took,\nthe most pronounced effect of that was\nyou could basically urinate\nover a car when taking SHBG.\nWhat the underlying mechanism\nof that was, I do not know.\nI took it for a short while,\nit didn't drop my SHBG very much,\nbut it did drop my DHT\nsufficiently so that I\nstopped taking it.\n- You felt that, yeah.\n- I do not like anything that impedes DHT.\nI don't care if my hairline retreats,\nI don't care about any of that.\nDHT to me is something to\nbe coveted and held onto\nbecause you feel so much better\nwhen your DHT is in the appropriate range,\nand I'd love your thoughts on that.\n- Yeah, again-\n- At some point too.\n- It really depends on the guy,\nand it depends on what risk\nyou're trying to manage, right.\nSo prostate size starts to become\none of the issues with DHT.\n- Luckily my prostate-specific\nantigen is low, and DHT,\nthe things that I know can reduce it\nare things like finasteride, Propecia,\nthings like, yeah, right.\nThings that people take\nto try and avoid hair loss\ncan dramatically reduce DHT\nand lead to all sorts of\nterrible sexual side effects,\nmood-based side effects, et cetera.\nBut yeah, so I'm not aware of anything\nthat could be taken in supplement form\nthat can really profoundly drop\nSHBG.\n- Yeah, we don't spend\nmuch attention on it anymore.\nBasically, I used to have\na much more complicated\ndifferential diagnosis eight years ago.\nLike, I mean it was, I\nwould drive patients nuts\nwith the whiteboard diagrams\nI would draw for them,\nwhen in the end, I think they\nwere just like, dude, just,\nwhat do I need to take?\nToday we take a much more simple approach.\nSo the first question is,\nshould you or should you\nhave your free testosterone being higher?\nThat's the metric I care about,\nis free testosterone is\nthe first, most important,\nthe second most important is estradiol.\n- And sorry to interrupt, you said,\nif you look at your total testosterone,\nyou want the free T to be\nabout 2% of your total.\n- Well, it should be, right.\nNow I can't, I might\nnot change that anymore.\nSo in other words, if a guy's at 1%,\nthen I know I have to really\nboost his total testosterone.\nIf he's only going to\nget one to 1 1/2% of it\nconverted to free, I need to boost him.\nAnd that's why I don't care\nif he's outside the range.\nLike, I'll have a guy who's free T,\nI might have to get a\nguy's total T up to 1500\nto get his free T to 18.\n- I see, so free T is the target.\nI like this approach.\n- Free T is what we treat.\n- And do you still use Anavarax,\n- I don't use-\n- oxandrolone, sorry,\nto try and lower SHBG.\n- I don't, no.\n- Because it's too potent?\n- No, because it's just too\ncomplicated for patients.\nIt's a drug that can't be taken orally,\nso you have to take it under the tongue.\n- Like a troche or something.\n- Right, but then, you know,\nI had one patient once who,\neven though we told him\nabout 87 times that,\nhe was like swallowing the\nAnavars and his liver function,\nand he was like, we're\ntalking 10 milligrams\nthree times a week is a tiny\ndose, and three months of him,\nor whatever, two months of\nhim swallowing that every time\ntripled his liver function test.\nSo it's like, I was like, you know,\nit's just not worth the\nhassle of doing this\nfor, you know, perfection.\nIn reality, we can fix this another way.\nSo the first order question is,\ndo we believe clinically you will benefit\nfrom normalizing your free testosterone,\nor taking it to a level,\nlet's call it 80th to 90th percentile.\nSo upper normal limit\nof physiologic ranges.\nThat's the first order question.\nAnd that's going to come down to symptoms,\nand that's going to come\ndown to some biomarkers.\nI think there's, two years ago,\nwas it two years ago or maybe a year ago,\nvery good study came out that\nlooked at pre-diabetic men,\nyou've probably talked about this study,\nand looking at insulin\nresistance and glucose disposal\nwith and without testosterone.\nAnd the evidence was overwhelmingly clear.\nTestosterone improves glycemic control.\nTestosterone improves insulin signaling.\nThis shouldn't be surprising by the way,\ngiven the role muscles\nplay as a glucose reservoir\nand a glucose sink.\nSo now I include that as one of the things\nthat we will consider as a\nfactor for using testosterone.\nNow, again, it's not the only one.\nSo you can accomplish that with exercise,\nyou can accomplish that\nwith these other things,\nbut then you get into a little\nbit of the vicious cycle of\nwill having a normalized testosterone\nfacilitate you doing those things better.\nSo let's just assume\nwe come to the decision\nthat this person is a good candidate\nfor testosterone replacement therapy.\nThe next question is,\nwhat's the method we're going to do.\nAre we going to do it\nindirectly or directly?\nNow we used to use a lot\nof Clomid in our practice.\nAnd have you talked\nabout Clomid on the pod?\n- Haven't talked too much about it.\nNo, we've talked a little\nbit about the fact that\nsome people taking things like anastrozole\nto reduce aromatase activity,\ncan potentially run into\ntrouble because they think,\noh well, more testosterone,\ngood, lower estrogen, bad,\nand then they end up with\nissues like joint pain,\nmemory issues, and severe drops in libido.\nAnd I think a lot of the reason why-\n- And even fat accumulation.\nSo if estrogen is too low,\nyou can develop adiposity in a way\nthat you wouldn't otherwise.\nThere was a great New\nEngland Journal paper,\nit's probably 10 years\nold now, that looked at,\nI believe it was five different doses\nof testosterone cypionate.\nSo these men were chemically castrated\nand divided into 10 groups.\nIt's pretty remarkable-\n- [Andrew] That somebody\nsigned up for this study.\n- Yeah, so you were with\nand without anastrozole\nand five doses of testosterone.\nSo now you basically had\nfive testosterone levels,\nplus or minus high or low estradiol.\nAnd the results were really clear\nthat the higher your testosterone\nand the more your estradiol\nwas in kind of that\n30 to 50 range, the better you were.\nSo if estrogen was too low,\neven in the presence of high testosterone,\nthe outcomes were less significant.\n- And this is 30 to 50\nnanograms per decile,\nnot 30 to 50% of one's testosterone.\nOkay, great.\nNo, we haven't talked, but Clomid is,\nyou know, we have not\ntalked a lot about Clomid.\nI'd love to get your thoughts on Clomid.\n- So Clomiphene is a fertility drug.\nIt's a synthetic hormone.\nIt's actually two drugs, M Clomiphene\nand I forget the other one.\nAnd it tells the pituitary\nto secrete FSH and LH.\nSo you, and so the advantage\nof Clomid is it's oral,\nand it's meant to be taken orally.\nSo, you know, a typical\nstarting dose would be like\n50 milligrams three times a week.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nnotice, in most men,\nespecially young men, FSH and LH goes up.\nIn any man, the FSH and LH go up,\nbut if a man still has testicular reserve,\nhe'll make lots of testosterone\nin response to that.\n'Cause that's the first order question\nwe're trying to answer is do you,\nis your failure to make\ntestosterone central or peripheral?\n- Yeah, and I think,\njust want to point out,\nagain, correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut my understanding is\nthat a lot of the drugs\nthat we're talking about,\nthe synthetic compounds,\ntestosterone, estrogen, things\nrelated to growth hormone,\net cetera, were discovered and designed\nin order to treat, and excuse me,\nin order to isolate and treat\nexactly these kinds of syndromes,\nwhether or not it was the\nhypothalamus, the pituitary,\nor the target tissue, the\novaries or the testes.\nCorrect?\n- Correct, yeah.\nI mean, I think, the easiest\nway to go about doing this\nis just give the hormone that's missing,\nwithout attention to\nwhere the deficiency is.\nWhy this becomes relevant is\nif you have a 35-year-old guy\nwhose testosterone is low,\nbut you can demonstrate that it's low\nbecause he's not getting\nenough of a signal\nfrom the pituitary,\nwhy would you bother giving\nhim more testosterone\nwhen he has the Leydig\ncells and the Sertoli cells\nto make testosterone.\nHe just needs the signal.\nSometimes, though not always,\njust a course of Clomid can wake him up,\nand he's back to making\nnormal testosterone.\n- So he'll do this three\ntimes a week, 50 milligrams,\nthree times a week, for\na short course, and then?\n- Yeah, we would do that\nfor eight to 12 weeks\nand then we reevaluate.\n- And estrogen and testosterone\nwill increase in parallel.\n- Yes.\nAnd again, it depends, you know,\naromatase activity is dependent\non how much body fat\nyou have and genetics.\nAnd if estradiol gets too high,\nwe think if it gets over about 55, 60,\nwe will give micro doses of anastrozole.\nBut it has to be real micro doses.\nI mean, you cannot pound\npeople with anastrozole.\nTo give you perspective,\nthe sort of on-label use,\nlike if you just go to a\npharmacy and order anastrozole,\nyou're going to get one milligram tablets.\nLike we can't give anybody a milligram.\n- [Andrew] They'll feel like garbage.\n- We have to have it\ncompounded at 0.1 milligrams,\nand we might give a patient\n0.1, two to three times a week.\nThat would be a big dose of anastrozole.\n- Yeah, I think that the\ntypical TRT clinic out there\nis giving 200 milligrams per mil, one mil,\n200 milligrams of testosterone\nonce every two weeks,\nand then hitting people\nwith multiple milligrams\nof anastrozole, and\nthey're all over the place.\n- I've never really understood,\nI mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised,\nbut it kind of blows my\nmind that these TRT clinics\nare up all over the place, given how bad.\nI mean, I see the results,\n'cause I have patients\nthat come from them,\nand I don't understand like\nwhy they're so incompetent.\n- I actually think it's worse than that.\nI think that they simply don't\nunderstand and don't care,\nbecause it's a pill mill\nand it's a money mill.\nI think that nowadays it seems\nalmost everybody who's doing TRT\nis taking lower doses more\nfrequently every other day,\nor twice a week, dividing the dose,\nand being very, very\ncareful with these estrogen\nor aromatase blockers.\n- Most of our patients do not\ntake aromatase inhibitors.\nIt's not needed.\nIt's really only the high\naromatasers that need it.\nAnd so yeah, when we'll\ntalk about testosterone,\nwe'll talk about dosing\nthere, 'cause I agree.\nThe more frequently you\ncan take it the better,\nand frankly, you don't\nneed to go more frequently\nthan twice a week.\n- Because it's so slow-acting.\n- The half-life, yeah,\nthe half life of the drug is,\nI think it's about 3 1/2 days,\nis the plasma half-life\nor something like that.\nI could be off a little\nbit, but twice week dosing\nis really nice.\nSo if you go to like a testosterone clinic\nthat's giving you 200 every two weeks,\n50 twice a week is the same\ntotal dose, which, by the way,\nis a physiologic dose.\nThat's not going to give\nsomebody any of the side effects\nyou would see.\nYou're not going to get acne with that.\nYou're not going to get gynecomastia.\nYou're not going to get anything.\nThe only real side\neffect you get from that\nis you will get testicular atrophy.\nIt is enough to suppress.\n- Yeah, to maintain fertility,\nwhat do you typically do for?\n- Well, so this is where,\nso I'll finish the story on Clomid,\n'cause we currently do not use Clomid,\nand that's due to a really\ninteresting observation\nthat we made, that I don't\nthink has been reported\nin the literature yet,\nwhich is that Clomid was\nincreasing levels of a sterol\nthat we also happen to\nmeasure called desmosterol.\n- [Andrew] I'm not familiar with that.\n- So, and the way that\ncholesterol is made, it's made by,\nthere's two pathways\nthat make cholesterol.\nSo it starts like with\ntwo carbon sub units,\nlike Acetyl-CoA, and it kind\nof marches down a pathway,\nbifurcates, and cholesterol is\nthe finished product of both.\nBut in one of those pathways,\nthe molecule right before\ncholesterol is called desmosterol,\nin the other pathway\nit's called lathosterol.\nSo we constantly measure\nlathosterol and desmosterol,\nbecause we want to know\nhow much cholesterol is being\nsynthesized in the body.\nNot just what your cholesterol is.\nWe want to know how much\ncholesterol you reabsorb.\nAnd those markers are\nreally important to us\nwhen we're looking at\ncardiovascular disease risk.\nSo when we gave patients Clomid,\nwe were noticing a almost universal rise\nin their desmosterol levels.\nNow, the most obvious\nexplanation for that,\nthough the last time I looked,\nI couldn't find clear explanation for this\nin any of the clinical,\nlike the clinical trials that\nled to the approval of Clomid.\nSo I don't know if it was described.\nIn fact, maybe it wasn't known.\nI suspect it is inhibiting the enzyme,\nwhich I think is called\ndelta-24 desaturates,\nthat turns desmosterol into cholesterol.\nMakes sense if you inhibit that enzyme,\nyou're going to see a rise in desmosterol.\nThis wouldn't have been a concern to me,\nif not for the fact that Tom Dayspring,\nwho's one of the physicians we work with,\nwho's one of the world's\nexperts in lipids,\npointed out a very obscure story,\nwhich was that the very\nfirst drug ever approved\nto treat cardiovascular disease,\nat least to treat hypercholesterolemia,\nwas a drug that attacked the same enzyme.\nSo this is in the early 1960s I believe,\nmaybe the mid '60s.\nThis drug was approved and\nit lowered cholesterol.\nAnd it was approved on the\nbasis of lowering cholesterol.\nNow today, no drug for ASCVD is approved\non the basis of it lowering cholesterol.\nThat's not a high enough bar.\nYou have to reduce events.\nActually have to show\nthat you're preventing\nheart attacks and death.\nBut at the time it was like,\nhey, it lowers cholesterol,\nit's got to be good.\nWell, in the late '60s it\nwas pulled from the market\nbecause events were going up.\nSo cholesterol was coming\ndown, events were going up.\nHow could that be?\nWe don't know.\nWhat we are suspecting\nis that desmosterol,\nwhich is still a sterol, was\npotentially more damaging\nand created more oxidative\nstress in the endothelium,\nin the sub-endothelial\nspace than cholesterol.\n- [Andrew] I see.\n- Which would at least\nsuggest to us, and again,\nwe're taking a lot of leaps here,\nthat maybe having high\ndesmosterol, very high desmosterol,\nis not a good thing.\nAnd so once we kind of\npieced all that together\na few years ago, we were like, yeah,\nwe're just not going to\nprescribe Clomid anymore.\nAnd we then switched to HCG,\nwhich we used to use\nsometimes instead of Clomid,\nbut it's more cumbersome to work with.\nIt needs to be refrigerated,\nit's a much more fragile molecule.\n- Yeah, I think we talked about this once.\nIt's almost like if you\naccidentally knock over\nthe little bottle, it's\nbasically gone bad.\n- Yeah yeah.\n- Travel with it\nis very challenging.\n- Can't travel with it.\nIt's a needle, you know,\nit's an injection, Sub-Q.\nSo easy to administer, it's\nnot IM or anything like that,\nbut it's just more of a hassle factor.\nBut that said, it has the\nbenefit that Clomid does,\nwhich is it preserves testicular function.\nIt preserves testicular volume.\nSo, you know, body builders\nwill often use this\nin their post-cycle therapy,\nas a way to kind of recover function.\nAnd we would just use it\nnow as ongoing therapy\nfor a guy who still\nhas testicular reserve.\n- So on its own, no testosterone,\nno aromatase inhibitor, nothing.\nJust a way to crank out\na bit more testosterone\nfrom the testes.\nMaybe some additional estrogen also?\n- Yeah, and HCG is a different model.\nHCG is just an analog\nof luteinizing hormone.\nSo it's basically like giving\nthem luteinizing hormone.\n- So it's going to crush endogenous\nluteinizing hormone levels,\nright, because it's-\n- Actually, yeah.\nYou don't really see\nmuch of an impact on LH,\nbut you do see endogenous\ntestosterone production go down.\nActually, no, I correct that.\nBoth FSH and LH will go\ndown on a high enough dose.\nYep.\n- Just as a mention,\nand here I'm not making recommendations,\nbut one supplement I've\ntalked a lot about publicly\nis Fadogia agrestis,\nwhich is this weird Nigerian shrub that-\n- You talked about this on Tim's podcast.\n- On Tim's podcast and Joe's\npodcast, and, you know,\nthere was a bit of a backlash\nbecause it does turn out\nthat at high doses, in rodent studies,\nit can cause some toxicity of the testes.\nBut at lower doses,\nit does seem to increase\nluteinizing hormone.\nAnd after talking about this,\na number of people went out there,\ndid pre and post blood work,\nand the consistent effect\nseems to be an increase\nin luteinizing hormone.\nThere's a noticeable effect\non testicular size and volume.\nSo a lot of people take this\nand be like, oh, you know,\ntheir balls are getting bigger,\nand so they get all excited\nthat something good is happening.\nBut we don't know the\nlong-term safety and efficacy\nof something like Fadogia,\nwhether or not it needs to be cycled-\n- Yeah, this is why I'm also\nvery leery of the supplements\nin this space, because at\nleast when we're using HCG,\nor testosterone, like we\nhave so many years of data.\nYou have to remember how many\nwomen are using this stuff\nfor reproductive medicine.\nSo, you know, I think the\nFDA has a lot of faults.\nI think I have an entire\npodcast devoted to\nthe corruption of the FDA\nand all of the mistakes\nthat have been made\nwith respect to their oversight in,\nespecially generic drugs.\nBut it's way more regulated\nthan the wild wild west of\nnutty supplement land.\n- Absolutely.\nI think that the reason we're\ntalking about things like\nTongkat and Fadogia was\nto provide some intermediate discussion\nbetween doing all the correct things,\nbut no supplementation or hormone therapy,\nand then going straight\nto hormone therapy.\n- Yeah, I-\n- It's sort of like\nthe leap from, I can't focus\nvery well, to Ritalin, right,\nwithout a real diagnosis\nof ADHD to, oh well,\nmaybe some things like\nAlpha-GPC low doses of nicotine, right?\nBut I agree entirely.\nI mean, the sourcing is important.\nThe dosages are worked out empirically\non an individual basis.\nAnd there aren't\nrandomized control trials.\nThere just aren't.\n- Yeah, and, you know,\nhave kind of like a seven,\nthis is another Peter Principle, right.\nSo I got a lot of patients that\ncome into the practice and,\nyou know, during our intake, we go through\nwhat drugs and supplements\nare you taking right now?\nAnd, you know, a lot of people come in,\nI'm not taking anything, Peter, I just,\nyou're in charge now, like\ntell me what you think.\nAnd then you get a lot\nof people that come in\nand they're like, are going\nto need an extra few pages\nfor this part of the documentation.\n- Right, the people who\ntravel with a suitcase\nthat you can hear as they\nwalk through the airport\nfrom all the pills rattling.\n- So I give these patients\na little homework exercise,\nwhich is you have to answer\nthese seven questions\nfor every supplement you take,\nand here's the spreadsheet\nand let's talk about it.\nAnd it basically just runs\nthrough like, you know,\nit's basically walking\nyou through the logic\nof why do you take this molecule?\nAnd I think for many people,\nit's when they do that,\nit's very sobering, right.\nThey kind of, a lot of them\nwill come back and be like,\nyou know what, I don't think\nI can come up with any reason\nalong this really\nrigorous line of thinking\nas to why I'm taking 80% of this stuff.\n- Well, I know people,\nand actually we know\nsome of the same people,\nwho are fanatic about like\nred light on the testes,\nsunning their testes, putting\nice packs on their testes.\nIt's kind of all over the place.\nThe number of things that\npeople are trying and doing\nin order to increase testosterone\noutput from their testes\nis pretty remarkable.\nAnd that said, among\nsome of the women I know,\nthe number of things that they're doing\nto try and promote\nlongevity and fertility,\nand in particular skin health,\nhair health and nail health,\nis also kind of outrageous.\nEverything from collagen\nto red light therapies,\nwhich may actually have some\nefficacy in certain cases.\nBut.\n- As an interesting aside.\n- There's a hunger there,\nright?\n- Oh for sure.\nOne of the things that I hope\ngets a lot more attention\nis the use of rapamycin for\npreserving ovarian health.\nSo the animal literature on this\nis pretty impressive, right?\nSo in mouse models, rapamycin\nwill preserve ovarian life.\nAnd so-\n- Interesting.\n- It makes sense, right.\nI mean, it totally makes sense\nwhy the most potent GRo\nprotective molecule we have\nwould also preserve and\nextend ovarian life,\nat least in mice.\nSo I'd love to see the\nclinical trials done in women\nto test this hypothesis.\n- I definitely want to come back to this,\n'cause that's a key thing.\nI know that a lot of\npeople are interested in\nfemale fertility out there,\nincluding their male partners.\nSo going back to, so now I understand\nwhy you don't prescribe clomiphene,\nbecause of this desmosterol,\npotential desmosterol link.\nWhat about testosterone therapy?\nSo less,\n- Yeah.\n- less frequent, lower doses,\nless or no estrogen inhibition\nor aromatase inhibition.\n- Yeah, only,\nwe're only using an aromatase blocker,\nand we use Arimidex when we do.\nIt's just to get that estradiol\ninto the range we want.\nI like to see it between 30 and 50.\nThat's the sweet spot.\nAnd I don't know, I would\nsay like a third, maybe a,\nnot even a third, I'd\nsay probably 20% of men\nrequire a micro dose of\nanastrozole to get into that range.\nMost do not.\nAnd I'd rather err on the\nside of being a little high\nthan a little low.\nSo I never really want to be below 25,\nunless sometimes it's\njust below 25 and it is,\nit is what it is, that's fine.\nBut if we're suppressing it to below 25,\nI never want to be in that zone.\nAnd then yes, so TRT is\nultimately, you know,\ngiving testosterone cypionate\nis usually what we use.\n- Injectable, so as\nopposed to cream or pellet.\n- Correct.\nI used to use pellets with women,\nfor some who were really adamant\nabout the convenience of it,\nbut for a bunch of reasons\nI just, I'm mostly not doing that\nand I've never been a\nfan of pellets in men.\n- You can't control the\ndosages, once it's in,\nright?\n- Well, even if you know\nthe dose, yeah, that's\nobviously a problem.\nBut I don't think, there's\na big difference between\nputting a pellet into a man and a woman.\nSo when you're putting a\nestrogen pellet into a woman,\nit's like, it's that big.\nWhen you're putting\nenough pellets into a man\nfor six months of testosterone,\nit's two sums of pellets that\nare longer than my fingers.\nSo you're putting like a V-shape.\n- [Andrew] Where are you putting this?\n- You're putting it into the gluteal fat.\nSo it's just a more morbid procedure,\nand I don't think it's necessary.\nI think if you know how\nto manage it, you know,\nthrough sort of the injections, and now-\n- [Andrew] Injections are no big deal.\n- Yeah, well especially\nnow if you're doing,\nwe're having them do\nSub-Q injections anyway.\nSo it's not IM, they're using\nfive-eights inch to a one inch\n25 gauge needle, which is\nabout the smallest needle\nyou can push the oil through,\nonce to twice a week, depending on.\nAnd by the way, if\nthey're real needle-phobes\nwe use Xyosted, which is a preloaded pen.\n- And are you having all men take HCG\nto maintain fertility\nand testicular size?\n- Only if they want to.\n- Got it.\n- And by the way, we do not\nlike to use TRT in men who,\nwe don't like to use\ntestosterone specifically in men\nwho still want to maintain fertility.\nWe just steer them away from that.\n- Because total sperm count goes down.\n- Yeah, we just say, why risk it.\nLike we'd rather use HCG.\n- [Andrew] Yeah, just on its own.\n- Yeah, just wait till\nyou're done reproducing.\nBank sperm, wait till\nyou're done reproducing\nbefore we go to testosterone.\n- What are some of the benefits,\nand what are some of the cautionary notes\nwith appropriate TRT,\nmeaning the kind of contour\nthat we're talking about here.\nA lower dose with the yes\nor no low estrogen control.\nPeople, what did generally\npeople report, how do they feel?\nWhat does it allow them to do\nthat they couldn't do or feel before?\nAnd then in terms of what\nare the markers to look for?\nIs it LDL, blood pressure,\nwater retention, acne,\nthose kinds of things.\nAre there some other things as well?\n- Yeah, it depends on the doses, right?\nI mean, again, we're using\nthese in really low doses,\nso it's pretty rare\nthat we'd have a patient\non more than a hundred milligrams\na week of testosterone.\nI think for comparison,\nlike a bodybuilder could\neasily take 500 to a thousand\nduring a high growth phase.\n- I know some of these\nguys, they go ballistic,\nor they're doing moderate levels\nof testosterone cypionate,\nbut they're also taking\nDianabols, Nandrolone,\nyou know, SARMs, and a\nbunch of other things.\nI mean, their stacks\nare kind of ridiculous.\nI mean, no disrespect to that sport,\nbut I mean, people are dying like crazy\nin that sport right now.\n- [Peter] It's outside of physiology.\n- Yeah, and I think for\n99% of people listening,\nthey look, they hear bodybuilder\nand they just go, like,\nwhy would somebody do that anyway?\n- [Peter] Right.\n- I think that's the typical response.\n- So the point is, a lot of,\nbut we owe those guys a\ngreat deal of gratitude\n'cause they've shown us the boundaries.\n- Including the women.\n- That's right, yeah, yeah.\nAnd so, those bodybuilders\nhave taught us a lot about\nlike what happens.\nAnd so yeah, the bloating,\nthe water retention, acne,\nhair loss, hair growth, all\nof those things we understand.\nThe truth of it is,\nwe just don't see those\nthings in our patients.\n- But a hundred milligrams\nper week is a very low output.\nMy understanding-\n- But it's a physiologic dose.\nI mean, the reality of it is\nit's enough for most people.\nI mean there's, probably the\nhighest we've ever had to go\nis maybe 70 twice a week.\n- What's the youngest patient\nyou've ever had to put on TRT?\n- Actual testosterone?\n- Mm hmm.\n- Probably, that's a good\nquestion, I'm thinking about.\nMaybe 40.\n- I think that's great for people to hear,\n'cause I know that a lot of\nguys in their 20s are thinking\nTRT is the way to go, and I would argue\nunless you're doing everything else right\nand you're still hypogonadal\nand you're really struggling,\nput that time off.\nBecause also the fertility issue\nyou want to delay, delay, delay.\n- Well, again, it depends\nif, when we say TRT,\nif you're in your 20s\nand there's no other way,\nI would hope you would\nbe steered toward HCG\nto at least preserve testicular function.\nNow again, we don't actually know\nif after being on HCG for 10 years,\nyour pituitary will still work.\n- Right, you won't be\nable to make your own\nluteinizing hormone.\n- Exactly.\nSo, it might be the case that\nyou're going to need something\nupstream of that, like Clomid,\nto kick start it, and\nthen we're, but again,\nI don't want anybody\nwho's listening to this\nwho's using Clomid for fertility,\nto think that there's\nanything wrong with it.\nI was, my concern over this became like,\nif you're going to be on this\nfor 10 years, is it problematic?\nNot if you're using\nthis for a course of IVF\nor something like that.\nSo, again, if we felt\nthat someone's pituitary\nwas not working, I would be happy to put\nthree months of Clomid on them\nto kind of try to see if\nwe could blast it back.\n- Do you have men cycle\non and off testosterone\nat these low dosages?\nAre they taking a month vacation from it\nevery once in a while?\n- Yeah, totally depends.\nYou know, I was talking to\na patient yesterday where\nwe're going to do, we just\ndecided to change his cycle,\neight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG,\neight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG.\nSo that's going to be a cycle\nthat maintains his testosterone level,\nbut fluctuates between\nendogenous, exogenous,\nendogenous, exogenous.\nSometimes we'll just do\ntestosterone on, off, on, off.\nAnd there it's like, how much\ncan he replenish naturally,\nbut understanding his T will\ndip during those off cycles.\n- Seems to me there's\na tremendous incentive\nfor somebody to develop a molecule\nthat can directly target SHBG,\nbesides Oxandrolone and Anavar, right?\nIf one could just drop\nSHBG just the tiniest bit,\nit seems like one could adjust the free T\nin a way that would be great.\nI don't know why that\nmolecule's so hard to target,\nbut somebody ought to do it.\nThe chemistry can't be\n- Yeah, it's funny.\n- that hard.\n- I talked with Patrick Arnold\nabout this many, many years ago.\nI wish I could remember what his ID,\nhe had a comment about this\nthat at the time made sense,\nand I don't remember what it was,\n'cause I had that thought too, like man.\nEspecially for that subset of guys\nwho have normal testosterone,\nbut they're just over binding it.\n- I'm really glad that\nyou brought up this issue\nof total testosterone versus\nfree T, and the reason is,\never since going on podcasts\nand talking about this stuff,\nand talking about it on this podcast,\npeople will send me their numbers.\nThey'll send me their charts\nand then they'll send\nphotos of themselves,\nand I can tell you,\nwhile I'm not a clinician\nand I haven't done fancy statistics on it,\nthere's very little correlation between\nsomeone's absolute testosterone\nand how they appear.\nI mean, some of these guys\nlook, you know, really lean,\nreally strong, and they'll say, oh,\ntotal testosterone is 550, 480, right.\nAnd then other people, you\nknow, testosterone is 860,\nbut you look at them and you think, oh,\nthey kind of have kind of\na dough-y look to them.\nAnd so it's got to be this\nfree testosterone thing,\nplus estrogen, et cetera.\nAnd so cosmetically-\n- Well, but also training\nand nutrition too, right.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- I mean, I just think,\nI think for all this\ntalk about testosterone,\nwhich I enjoy talking about and, you know,\nI enjoy talking about\nthe data on, you know,\nlong-term health\nconsequences of testosterone,\n'cause it's another controversial topic,\nI also think people kind of\noverstate its importance.\n- [Andrew] I agree.\n- And I think there's a\ngroup of people who think\nif I could just fix my testosterone,\neverything will be better.\nAnd it's sort of like, no,\nactually that's not true at all.\nReally, the only purpose in\nmy mind of fixing testosterone\nis to give you the\ncapacity to work harder.\nIt's really going to help you recover more\nfrom your workouts.\nThis should just give\nyou a greater ability\nto experience muscle protein synthesis.\nSo, you know, if I just give\nyou a bunch of testosterone\nand you sit on the couch and\nyour nutrition doesn't change\nand you're not exercising anymore,\nyou're not going to experience\nany benefits of this thing.\nI mean, my testosterone level\nhas fluctuated quite a bit\nthroughout my life.\nAnd when I think about as an adult,\nnot sort of including when I was sort of\na fanatical teenager, but as an adult,\nwhen was I at my absolute\nmost insane physique,\nlike my best performance on\na DEXA scan, would've been,\nI was 38-years-old, by\nDEXA I was 7% body fat.\nMy fat free mass index was like 23.2,\n23.3 kilograms per meter squared.\nI mean, I was huge,\nstrong, and totally ripped.\nMy testosterone was in the toilet.\nI was over-training like crazy.\nI was, you know, exercising\nprobably 26 hours a week,\nkilling it in the gym,\nswimming like a banshee,\ncycling like my life depended on it,\ngrossly over-trained,\nlow T, but, you know,\nI mean physically looked like\ntwice the guy I am today.\nYou know, today my T's\nprobably twice as high\nas it was then.\nSo, you know, now you\ncould say, well, Peter,\nwhat if you took T back then?\nHow much better could you have been?\nSure.\nBut, again, I think the take home is\njust giving somebody T\ndoesn't do much of anything.\nIt probably helps on the\ninsulin resistance front,\nwithout any other thing.\nBut to me that's a waste,\nlike that's squandering the\ngift that it is giving you,\nwhich is the ability to do\nmore work and, you know,\ncapture the benefit of it\nvia muscle protein synthesis.\n- I agree, and I think that the\npsychological effect of testosterone,\nwhether or not it's\nexogenous or endogenous,\nis it makes effort feel good.\n- Yeah.\n- At some level\nit really seems to do that.\nAnd Sapolsky tells me the main reason,\nor mechanistically the main\nreason that it can do that\nis by adjusting levels of\nactivity in the amygdala.\n- Interesting.\n- And so there's\nsome interesting imaging there.\nI'd love to chat more about\nthe cholesterol pathway,\nand I know this is a\nhuge landscape as well,\nbut I think we're doing a\ngood job of diving in deep,\nbut not getting stuck in the\nunderlying currents at all.\nThere's tremendous debate\nabout whether or not\ndietary cholesterol directly relates to,\nor does not relate to, serum\ncholesterol, LDL and HDL.\nHere's my-\n- Is there?\n- I think, well, let me put it this way.\nThere are people that argue,\nI'm certainly not arguing.\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- There are people that argue\nthat if one eats a ton of saturated fat,\nthat LDL goes up and HDL goes down.\n- Oh, okay, but that's not\ndietary cholesterol per se.\n- No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,\nand then there are people\nthat argue that, you know,\nany increase in saturated fat\nintake is going to be bad,\nthat you already synthesize\nenough cholesterol\nfor hormone production, et cetera.\nI'd like to talk about this in terms of\nhow one should read their charts.\nMy LDL is in what I'm\ntold is healthy range.\nMy HDL is in what I'm\ntold is healthy range.\nI do try and not overeat\nthings like butter, cheese,\nand red meat, but I do\neat some of those things\nand I feel pretty good.\nBut most people are operating\nunder the assumption that\neating saturated fat is bad,\nand you only do it insofar\nas you want to taste it.\nAnd then of course there's\na small group of people\nthat love to eat organs and meats,\nand really pack cholesterol,\nand would argue that it doesn't\nmatter if your LDL is 870,\nit's not going to impact your health.\nWhat's the reality around\nLDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol,\nsaturated fat, at least in your view?\n- So first let's differentiate\nbetween cholesterol and fat,\njust for the listener,\n'cause we use them, you know,\nI want to make sure people understand.\nSo, cholesterol is a really\ncomplicated molecule.\nSo it's a ringed molecule.\nGod, I used to know exactly\nwhat its structure was,\nbut like it could have 36\ncarbons, for all I remember.\nIt is a lipid, so it is\na hydrophobic molecule\nthat is synthesized by every\ncell in the human body.\nIt is so important that without it,\nif you look at sort of genetic conditions\nthat impair cholesterol synthesis,\ndepending on their severity,\nthey can be fatal in utero.\nSo in other words, anything\nthat really interferes with\nour ability to produce cholesterol,\nis a threat to us as a species.\nAnd the reason for that\nis cholesterol makes up\nthe cell membrane of\nevery cell in our body.\nSo, you know, as you know,\nbut maybe the listeners don't,\neven though a cell is a spherical thing,\nit has to be fluid, right?\nIt's not just a rigid like\nsphere, like a, you know,\na blow up ball, right?\nIt's got to be able to\nkind of move in this way\nto mesh with other cells.\nIt also has to accommodate\nhaving porous structures\nthat traverse its membrane\nto allow ions and things\nlike that to go across.\nAnd it's cholesterol\nthat gives the fluidity\nto that membrane.\nIt's also, as you're alluding to,\nthe backbone of some of\nthe most important hormones\nin our body.\nEstrogen, progesterone,\ntestosterone, cortisol.\nSo we have this thing, super important.\nOkay.\nThen let's talk about, can you\nget cholesterol in your diet?\nYes, you can eat foods that\nare rich in cholesterol.\nWhat was known in 1960,\nbut somehow escaped\neverybody's imagination\nuntil finally the\nAmerican Heart Association\nacknowledged this a few years ago,\nis that the cholesterol you eat\ndoes not really make it into your body.\nAnd the reason for that\nis it's esterified.\nSo we have, and not to get\ntoo nerdy, but I think people,\nI really think it's\nimportant people understand\nhow this thing works.\nSo we have cells in our\ngut, and enterocytes,\nthey're the endothelial cells of our gut.\nThey have, each one of them has basically\ntwo transporters on them.\nSo the first is called\nthe Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.\nThe second is called the\nATP-binding cassette G5/G8.\nOkay.\nThe Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter\nwill bring in any sterol,\ncholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol.\nAny sterol that fits through\nthe door will come in.\nVirtually all of that is\nthe cholesterol we produce\nthat gets taken back to the liver,\nthat the liver packages\nin bile and secretes.\nSo that's what aids in our digestion,\nwhich is another thing I\nshould've mentioned earlier.\nIn addition to using cholesterol\nfor cell membranes and hormones,\nwe wouldn't be able to digest\nour food without cholesterol,\nbecause it's what makes up the bile salts.\nSo our own cholesterol is\nbasically recirculated in a pool\nthroughout our body,\nand this is the way it\ngets back into the body.\nIt's through this Niemann-pick\nC1-like 1 transporter.\nWhen it gets in there, the body,\nthis is the checkpoint of regulation.\nThis is where the body says,\ndo you have enough cholesterol\nin the body, yes or no?\nIf yes, I will let that\ncholesterol make its way\ninto the circulation.\nSo it'll go off the\nbasolateral side of the cell,\nnot the luminal side, into the body.\nAlternatively, the body\nsays, you know what?\nWe have enough cholesterol.\nI'm going to let you poop this out.\nAnd now the ATP-binding\ncassette will shoot it out,\nit'll go back into the luminal\nside, and away it goes.\nSo all of the cholesterol in our body\nis not esterified.\nAnd it doesn't have that\nbig, bulky side chain\nattached to it.\nThe cholesterol you eat is esterified,\nand an esterified cholesterol molecule\nsimply can't physically pass through\nthat Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.\nNow, we probably manage to de-esterify\n10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol.\nSo in other words,\nthere are small amounts\nof dietary cholesterol\nthat do make their way\ninto our circulation,\nbut it represents a small fraction\nof our total body's pool of cholesterol.\nAgain, this was known, even by Ancel Keys,\nthe guy who turned fat\ninto the biggest boogeyman\nof all time.\nAncel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.\nDietary cholesterol plays no\nrole in serum cholesterol.\nAgain, it took the\nAmerican Heart Association\nanother 60 years to figure that out.\nBut even now they acknowledge that.\nDietary cholesterol has no bearing.\n- So why is it that it's\npretty easy to find studies,\nor at least people who\nare highly credentialed\nfrom good institutions, claiming\nthat eating saturated fat-\n- [Peter] Saturated fat's different.\n- Saturated fat and red meat,\nthings that are rich in\ncholesterol, to be more specific,\nis bad for us in terms\nof our eventual LDL.\n- So this is two different things.\nSo saturated fat\nconsumption in many people\nwill erase LDL cholesterol.\nSo it's important to\ndifferentiate between the,\nwhat is saturated fat?\nSo saturated fat of\ncourse is a fatty acid,\njust so people understand.\nTotally different\nmolecule from cholesterol.\nCholesterol is this very\ncomplicated ring structure,\nmultiple rings stuck together.\nSFA, saturated fat, is just\na long chain fatty acid\nthat is fully saturated,\nmeaning it has no double bonds,\nand it can exist in isolation.\nIt can exist in a\ntriglyceride, triglycerides,\nor, you know, a phospho lipid,\nor all sorts of things like that.\nSo when we eat foods that contain fat,\nbasically there are three\ndistinctions for that fat.\nIs it saturated, is it\nmonounsaturated, one double bond,\nor is it polyunsaturated,\ntwo or more double bonds?\nThe observation that eating saturated fat\nraises cholesterol is generally correct.\nBut again, now it makes,\nbecause if we're going to\nstart talking about LDL,\nwe have to explain what LDL is.\nThis is another one of those things\nthat's just so grossly\nmisunderstood, that it's,\nit makes having discussions\nabout this very complicated.\nLet's go back to the\ncholesterol problem, right?\nSo every cell in our\nbody makes cholesterol,\nand almost without\nexception, they make enough.\nThere are a handful of times, however,\nwhen a cell needs to borrow\ncholesterol from another cell.\nOkay, so how would you do this, right?\nSo if you're sort of, if\nyou're playing God for a minute\nand you want to design a system,\nyou have to be able to\ntransport cholesterol\nfrom one cell to another.\nThe most logical place\nyou would transport this\nis through the circulation.\nAnd the problem with\ncirculation is it's water.\nPlasma is water.\nSo now you have this problem, which is,\nI want to transport cargo\nthat is hydrophobic,\nin a hydrophilic medium.\nCan't do it.\nSo if you think about all\nthe things that we transport\nin our blood, sodium,\nelectrolytes, glucose,\nthings like that, they're water soluble.\nIt's easy.\nThey just move back and forth in our blood\nwith no chaperone.\nBut when you want to move cholesterol,\nyou have to package it in\nsomething that's hydrophilic.\nThat something is called a lipoprotein.\nSo we have these spherical molecules\nthat are lipid on the inside,\nprotein on the outside, lipoprotein,\nand inside they contain\ncholesterol and triglycerides.\nSo now you've got this spherical thing,\ntriglyceride, cholesterol on the inside,\nand it's chaperoned by\na hydrophilic molecule\nthat allows it to move\nthrough our circulation.\nAnd those lipoproteins exist\nin different densities.\nSo if you run these out on\na gel electrophoresis plate,\nyou'll identify different densities.\nThe density is a function\nof how much protein\nand how much lipid is in it.\nSo the highest density of this\nis called a high density lipoprotein,\nand the lowest density of this is called\na very low density lipoprotein, a VLDL.\nAnd then next to that you have an LDL,\na low density lipoprotein,\nand then next to that you have an IDL,\nan intermediate density lipoprotein.\nSo, you know, it actually goes\nVLDL, IDL, LDL, but anyway.\nSo when people say my LDL\nis high, or my LDL is 100,\nwhat are they saying?\nThey're saying the\ncholesterol concentration\nof my LDL particles is a hundred\nmilligrams per deciliter.\nSo the total cholesterol concentration\nyou have in your circulation\nis that number that\nsays total cholesterol.\nSo if someone's blood panel\nsays my total cholesterol's 200,\nit means that if you take\nall the lipoproteins in their\ncirculation, bust them open\nand measure the cholesterol content,\nit's 200 milligrams per deciliter.\nAnd for all intents and purposes,\nbecause the IDLs are so short-lived,\nthat's basically the sum\nof your LDL cholesterol,\nyour VLDL cholesterol,\nand your HDL cholesterol.\nThose three things sum to\nyour total cholesterol.\n- What about LDL little a\nthat you mentioned earlier?\n- [Peter] LP little a is another-\n- LP, excuse me.\n- Yeah, yeah,\nhe's another actor.\nHe is a special type of LDL that, again,\nin sort of 10 to 20% of the population,\nis a really bad actor.\nSo that's an LDL that has\nanother apolipoprotein on it\ncalled apolipoprotein little a.\n- [Andrew] Got it.\n- The other thing I'll just say on this,\nbecause earlier I mentioned ApoB.\nThere are two broad\nfamilies of lipoproteins.\nThere are those that are wrapped in ApoBs,\nand those that are wrapped in ApoAs.\nThe ApoA family is the HDL family.\nThe ApoB family is the\nVLDL, IDL, LDL family.\n- I see.\nSo for somebody who let's say\ntheir total cholesterol is,\nlet's just stay with 200 for simplicity.\nWhat do you like to see in\nterms of the HDL LDL ratio?\n- Couldn't care less.\nI only care about ApoB.\nI only care about ApoB.\nI care about the causative\nagent of atherosclerosis.\nApoB is the thing that\ndrives atherosclerosis.\n- And what levels are\nattractive or repulsive for you\nwhen you see levels of\nApoB that are blank,\nyou get really concerned?\n- It depends on the person's objectives.\nSo again, we take a very different view.\nI mean, we have.\n- Vitality now, and I want\nto live to be a hundred.\n- Yeah, so if you see-\n- And I'm assuming some taper.\n- If you tell me you want\nto live to be a hundred,\nyou're going to need to keep your ApoB\nbelow 30 milligrams per deciliter.\n- Let's say I want to live to\nbe a hundred, but I also, well,\nhow about, I don't care how long I live,\nbut I want to feel great while I live.\n- Again, it depends, right?\nLike anybody who's had a heart attack\nis going to be compromised\nin their ability\nto feel well after.\nRight, so.\n- I guess, I say it that way,\nbecause if you're going to tell me that\nin order to achieve that\nlive to a hundred level,\nI'm going to have to\ngive up my personal life\nand my-\n- No no, to get-\n- and my brain functioning,\nthen I'm not really interested.\n- Sure, but to get LDL\nlevels, and really, again,\npeople think of it as LDL,\nit's really ApoB, right?\nApoB is this total\nconcentration of LDL and VLDL.\nAnd that's what matters.\nThose are the big atherogenic particles.\nLDL also includes the Lp[a],\nalthough the concentration of Lp[a]\nis relatively speaking so small\nthat it doesn't generally\nshow up as much in the ApoB.\nSo we treat ApoB, and basically\nwhat it comes down to is\nyou want ApoB to be as\nclose to the level as it was\nwhen you were born.\nSo we start developing heart\ndisease when we're born.\nThat's just the way it is.\nThe autopsy studies make\nthis abundantly clear.\nWhen you look at autopsies of young people\nwho are dying in their 20s,\nand this was first done in the\n1970s, it was again repeated.\nAgain, it's always done\nafter we have a war, right?\nSo in the 1970s, it was\ndone on people, you know,\nwho died in Vietnam.\nIn the early 2000s it was\ndone on mostly young men,\nbut some young women, who were, you know,\ndying in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAnd we saw without any ambiguity\nthat cardiovascular disease is\nalready taking hold in people\nwho are 18, 19, 20-years-old.\n- [Andrew] Wow!\n- And to be clear, they aren't\ngoing to die of atherosclerosis\nat that age.\nThey're still 40, 50 years away from it.\nBut this is a lifelong disease.\nAnd we also know that the\ndisease can't really develop\nuntil ApoB reaches a certain threshold.\nAnd that's the threshold\nthat most of us get to\nby the time we're sort of in our teens.\nSo it's this really young ApoB level\nof kind of 20 to 30\nmilligrams per deciliter,\nthat makes it impossible\nto get atherosclerosis.\nSo ApoB is necessary, but not\nsufficient to develop ASCVD.\nNow that, go ahead.\n- Oh, I'm sorry, I was just going to ask,\nwhat are some of the top\nbehavioral nutritional\nsupplementation, if any, based,\nand prescription drug-based\nways to target ApoB?\n- Well, nutritionally, you basically have\ntwo big tools, right?\nAnd it depends on what's driving up ApoB.\nSo ApoB, remember,\nis the concentration of\nLDL and VLDL particles.\nAnd what do they carry?\nCholesterol and triglycerides.\nSo anything that reduces cholesterol\nand reduces triglycerides,\nis going to reduce ApoB.\nTriglycerides are generally\ndriven by carbohydrate intake.\nSo more insulin-resistance,\nmore carbohydrate intake,\nmore triglycerides.\nSo we, I mean clinically,\nthis is readily apparent to\nanyone who treats patients.\nIf you restrict carbohydrates,\nyou will reduce triglycerides.\nThat just happens all day long.\nBut if you reduce triglycerides\nby raising fat intake so\nmuch, it can still raise ApoB.\nSo you have to be able to think about it.\nSo in an ideal world, it's\ncan you lower saturated fat,\nwhich tends to be the one\nthat is most driving ApoB,\nwhile lowering carbohydrate,\nand then see what you can get.\nBut here's the reality of it is,\nthere's nobody with dietary intervention\nthat's going to get to a level of\n30 milligrams per deciliter.\nI mean, I've never seen anything.\n- Pure dietary intervention.\n- Yeah.\n- So what are the other things that-\n- [Peter] It's got to be\npharmacologic at this point.\n- Statin type interventions?\n- Well, now you have\nmultiple classes of drugs.\nSo the tried and true is the statin.\nSo statins work by inhibiting\ncholesterol synthesis,\nand the net effect of that is that the,\nso the liver is really\nsensitive to cholesterol levels.\nIt doesn't want too much,\nit doesn't want too little.\nWhen you inhibit cholesterol synthesis,\nthe liver says, I want more cholesterol.\nSo it puts more LDL\nreceptors on its surface,\nand it pulls the LDL out of circulation.\nThat's what lowers the\nLDL in the circulation.\nSo, you know, again, nine\nstatins in use today,\nwe typically use four of them.\nThe side effect profile,\ncontrary to kind of all the sort of\nstatin-hating propaganda out\nthere, very benign, right?\n5% of people experience muscle soreness,\nwhich reverses upon cessation.\n- Cognitive effects?\n- Again, I think it's, in\nterms of actual comparing it\nin a placebo, no effect whatsoever, right.\nSo does that mean that\nyou put a patient on it,\nthey won't complain of something?\nNo, but if you look at clinical trials,\nthere's no evidence whatsoever\nthat statins impair cognition.\nThere's also no evidence\nin clinical trials\nthat they accelerate the risk\nof neurodegenerative disease.\nIn fact, it's the opposite.\nNow we will, there's a very\nnuanced case we make, Andrew,\nwhich is we'll look at patients with\nhighly suppressed desmosterol levels.\nWe will back off.\nWe do want to maintain\ndesmosterol above a certain level,\nbecause of some evidence\nthat is still, I think,\nvery preliminary, but\nenough for us that we say,\nwhy take the chance?\nWe have so many other\ntools to lower cholesterol,\nwhy would we over-suppress synthesis\nin a susceptible individual?\nSo the next tool you look at is\na drug that blocks the absorption,\nor the reabsorption of cholesterol.\nRemember that Niemann-pick\nC1-like 1 transporter?\nSo that guy has a drug called ezetimibe\nthat just mechanically blocks it.\nSo in people, and that's\nwhy I mentioned earlier,\nwe measure all those sterols in people,\nso we also measure things\ncalled phytosterols.\nAnd the phytosterols give us an indication\nof how active that transporter is.\nSo the higher your phytosterols,\nthe more likely you are\nto respond to ezetimibe.\nNext class of drugs\nis a drug that blocks\ncholesterol synthesis,\nbut only in the liver.\nSo the statin does it globally.\nThis other drug called bempedoic acid\ndoes it only in the liver.\nSo it has a very similar\nmechanism to statins.\nDifferent enzyme.\nNot quite as potent, but\nway fewer side effects.\nSo any patient that's\nhaving a response to statins\nthat's adverse, we'll\ntry this other thing.\n- What's it called, one more time?\n- [Peter] Bempedoic acid.\n- Bempedoic acid.\n- The most potent drug of the\nlot is the PCSK9 inhibitor.\nSo PCSK9, it's a protein\nthat was discovered\nin the late '90s, I believe,\nis responsible for the\ndegradation of LDL receptors.\nThis was first discovered in\npeople who had a condition\ncalled familial\nhypercholesterolemia, or FH.\nSo these are people that have\nincredibly high cholesterol.\nTypically their total\ncholesterol level is 300.\nTheir LDL cholesterol\nis typically, you know,\nnorth of 200 milligrams per deciliter.\nThis is a disease that is\ndefined by the phenotype,\nnot the genotype.\nSo the phenotype has a\nvery clear definition,\nwhich I basically just gave you.\nThe genotype is, there's a\nmillion paths to get there.\nThere's over 3000 mutations\nthat are known to produce that phenotype.\nThis was discovered to be one of them.\nIn people who had hyper functioning PCSK9,\nthis protein was just constantly hammering\nand destroying the LDL receptors.\nAnd so their LDL would be huge.\nAnd by extension, their\ntotal cholesterol would be.\nSo in 19, no sorry, in 2006,\nHelen Hobbs and colleagues discovered\nan opposite group of population.\nPeople who had LDL cholesterol naturally\nof 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter,\nwhich would be an ApoB of about\n20 milligrams per deciliter,\nand who never got heart disease.\nThey were immune to heart disease,\nno matter how long they live.\nAnd they had the opposite,\nthey had hypofunctioning PCSK9.\nAnd so that was 2006\nin the \"New England Journal of Medicine.\"\nThat basically got a whole\nbunch of drug companies\nhot on the trail of\nproducing a drug to mimic it.\nSo now we have these antibodies,\nand they're wildly effective.\n- What percentage of your patients over 45\ndo you have on either a statin\nor on one of these\nother classic compounds?\n- Well, often it's in\ncombinations, and I would say 80%.\n- [Andrew] Eight zero?\n- Well you have to remember\nwhat our objective is.\nLike, we're in the business\nof trying to make sure\npeople live as long as possible.\nAnd you have to take a sort\nof world view of this, right?\nIf you, like what's the most prevalent\ncause of death globally?\n- [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease.\n- Yeah, and like, how close is it?\nSo the last year before COVID,\nCOVID kind of messes up\nthese numbers a little bit,\nbut if you go to 2019,\n18.6 million people died of heart disease.\nNumber two, cancer, 10 million.\nLike nothing's in the zip\ncode of atherosclerosis.\nAnd if you remember what I just said,\nif you took everybody in their 20s\nand reduced them to a\nlevel of that of a child,\nyou'd make ASCVD an orphan disease.\n- So.\n- So the question is\ncan you do that?\n- Why don't we hear more,\nwhy don't we hear more about this?\nI realize there's some nuance.\nIt's not straightforward,\nit's not as simple as saying,\neat less cheese, red\nmeat and watch your LDL,\nget on a statin.\nBut why do we hear so little about ApoB,\nin the general discussion?\nSocial media is such a\nskewed landscape, as we know.\nPeople shouting into\ntunnels of varying clarity.\nSome are beautiful bronze tunnels\nwith clean walls and others\nare sewer lines, right.\nAnd they all converge in the same place.\n- Yeah.\n- Right, as we know.\nBut why do we hear so little about this?\nI mean, I'm not on a statin,\nbut now I'm beginning to think that\nmaybe that might be a\ngood idea to consider\none of these other compounds.\nI don't know the last time I\nlooked at my ApoB specifically,\nI'm guessing my physician did.\nBut why don't we hear more about this?\nThis sounds so important.\nIt sounds like the most\nimportant conversation,\n'cause all the hormone stuff\nand all the stuff about\nsmoking, and head injuries,\nand ADHD and all the rest,\nI mean, is irrelevant\nif you're dead, right?\n- Yeah.\nIt's a great question, I don't\nthink I have a great insight\nas to why this isn't\nmore front and center.\nI think the bigger problem is\nwhy don't we even understand\nhow to think about it?\nI mean the, and there's a\nwhole chapter in my book\nI'm working on that really\ngets to this problem of,\nwhy aren't we looking at atherosclerosis\nin terms of treating the causative agent?\nInstead, we look at\nmodifying 10-year risk.\nSo that's the fundamental\ndifference between what I call\nmedicine 2.0 and medicine 3.0.\nMedicine 2.0, which is what we're\ngenerally practicing today,\nwhen it comes to ASCVD says, look,\nwe will treat you, we will\nlower that LDL cholesterol,\nthey still don't talk about ApoB,\nbut that's a very American thing.\nIf you go outside of the United States,\neverybody's talking about ApoB,\nit's in the guidelines\nin Europe and Canada,\nand everywhere else.\nThe United States is\nvery stubborn on this,\nand it's due to a couple of\nreally weird personalities\nin the lipid world.\nBut the paradigm is, when\nyour 10-year risk reaches 5%,\nwhen there's a 5% chance\nthat you're going to have\na heart attack, stroke, or\ndie in the next 10 years,\nnow it's time to treat you.\nMedicine 3.0 says that's not\nthe way to think about it.\nYou treat the causative agent.\nIf there's a causative\nagent, you treat it.\nIf blood pressure raises\nthe risk of heart disease,\nyou lower blood pressure.\nIf smoking raises the risk of\nsomething, you treat smoking.\nAnd the reason that the\nrisk model is so bad\nwhen you're looking at 10-year risk,\nis age is the biggest driver of risk.\nI mean bar none, right?\nSo if you take a 70-year-old\nwith perfect lipids\nand perfect blood pressure\nand perfect everything,\ntheir 10-year risk of ASCVD\nis probably four to five times higher\nthan the most unhealthy 30-year-old.\nIt's not even close.\n- It's a lot like eye disease.\nYou know, there are exceptions, of course,\nbut we always say that\nthe biggest risk factor\nfor going blind from glaucoma\nis being an older person, frankly.\n- So if you could identify\nwhat the risk factors are\nfor glaucoma, imagine if the paradigm was,\nwe're only going to treat it\nwhen your risk of blindness reaches 5%,\nwhich isn't triggered until\nyou're old enough anyway.\nWouldn't you rather know\nthat when you're 30?\n- Absolutely.\n- And say, wait,\nif maybe being in the sun\nwithout sunglasses, or, you know,\nusing this type of eye drop\nor something like that,\nhas a negative impact, I\nwould rather know that sooner.\nSo that's the fundamental difference.\nIt's a philosophical difference,\nwith respect to prevention.\nAnd I will acknowledge that\nin one element of prevention,\nI make no consideration.\nI am only coming at this through\nthe lens of the individual.\nI am never coming at this\nthrough the lens of society.\nThat makes my life easier,\nand it makes the problem\nI'm solving easier.\nI don't have to answer\nthe quality adjusted life year problem.\nI don't have to ask the question,\nis it economical to treat people at 30?\nI don't know the answer to that question.\nBut I also know that when\nyou're trying to solve\nreally complicated problems,\nthe more you can simplify the better.\nSo I've just acknowledged\nopenly, not solving that,\nif you want to criticize\nme for it, that's fine.\nLet's be transparent.\nBut all I care about is the\nperson I'm sitting across from,\nand in that situation,\nit's really their decision\nif they can justify the cost of treatment.\n- An esoteric question, and\nthen a less esoteric question.\nThe esoteric question relates to something\nthat I think is a little bit\nniche, but not necessarily so,\nwhich is, peptides and stem cells and PRP.\nI don't want to go off on too\nmuch of a tangent on rehab,\nbut I know you've done a number of posts\non social media recently that were,\nI have to just tell you\nwere really thoughtful,\nand I really appreciate\nthat you're willing to share\nyour own tissue rehabilitation experience,\nand point people to that,\nbecause this is a landscape\nthat a lot of people are in\nand they don't know how to navigate it.\nAnd a mutual friend of\nours, not to be named,\nsent me a text and said, I'm\ngoing to be talking to Attia,\nand what do you know about\nstudies on things like BPC-157,\nthis gastric peptide that\nanecdotally, again, anecdotally,\npeople report getting injections\nof this into the shoulder,\nknee, et cetera, and feeling\nso much better, so much faster,\nbut there really aren't good\nstudies, controlled studies.\nAnd you hear all the same\nsorts of things about\nplatelet-rich plasma, PRP,\nwhich, if someone tells you\nthere are a lot of stem\ncells in them, they're lying.\nThere are not a lot of stem cells in them.\nAnd you also hear about stem cells,\nwhich are not FDA\napproved, at least in this,\nfor most uses in this\ncountry, but are certainly,\npeople are flying down to\nColombia and getting injections.\nAnd what is your\nunderstanding or experience\nwith things like BPC-157, specifically,\n'cause peptides is a huge landscape.\nWe should probably do a\nwhole episode on peptides.\nThings like PRP.\nPRP is now approved for, I mean,\nwomen are getting injections\nof this into their ovaries\nto improve follicle count.\nWe know this.\nPeople are getting injections of PRP\ninto every tissue and organ and, hell,\nmen are getting injected\ninto their penis, so I hear,\nfor all sorts of reasons\nthat are unclear to me.\nWhat's the deal with PRP,\nBPC-157, and stem cells?\nDo you ever see interesting effects?\nAre you curious about these compounds?\nDo you prescribe or direct\npeople towards these?\nThe FDA approved ones of course.\n- Yeah, so short answer is,\nI'm definitely curious about them\nand I'd love to see the work done,\nbut I also think this is\nabout as wild wild west\nas it gets.\nPRP less so, but certainly\nstem cells and peptides.\nAnd, you know, I just think,\nif you're going to do something\nwithout a clinical trial,\nyou got to show up with\na lot more data, right?\nSo let's use rapamycin\nas an example, right?\nI'm a huge proponent of rapamycin.\nAnd you can say, well, Peter,\nhow can you take or prescribe rapamycin\nfor GRo protective effects,\nwhen we do not have a human clinical trial\ndemonstrating that it lengthens life?\nAnd the answer is, because I\nhave 84 other pieces of data\nthat all point in the same direction\nacross every model organism\ngoing back more than a billion years.\nAnd that's really different from,\nJoey, Sammy, and Sally did this thing,\nand I think it works.\nAnd they just can't be compared.\nNow I have no idea if stem cells work.\nI have no idea if BPC-157 works.\nI have no idea, frankly,\nif PRP even works,\nthough it might seem to have some efficacy\nand some indications.\nFor example, maybe when it\ncomes to early hair loss.\nMaybe when it comes to, you\nknow, certain joint issues.\nBut the reality of it is like,\nI think we just have\nto accept the fact that\neverything we do has an opportunity cost,\nand that opportunity cost\nis sometimes financial.\nBut I actually find a lot of times it's in\ntime and effort and energy\nthat goes into something.\nNow, when I was, you know,\nwaiting to get my shoulder surgery,\nthis is an injury that\nI've had forever, right?\nThis is an injury, you know,\nthis injury was actually probably\nthe greatest source of discomfort I had\nswimming the Catalina Channel\nthe last time in 2009.\nSo that tells you how\nlong I've had this injury.\nBut, you know, I sort\nof knew at some point,\nlike, I'm going to have to have it fixed.\nAnd I sort of went down\nthis rabbit hole like, hey,\nis there anything I can do\nto avoid having surgery?\nYou know, would infusing a\nmillion stem cells into it work?\nAnd in speaking with as many\northopedic surgeons as I could,\nthe answer was kind of unambiguously no.\nAnd by the way, it doesn't\nmean you wouldn't feel better\nif I injected a bunch of stem\ncells into your shoulder.\nThere are a lot of reasons that\nmight make you feel better.\nJust like there are a bunch\nof reasons you can feel better\nif somebody injects saline\ndirectly into your joint.\nSo the question is, is it going\nto fix the underlying problem,\nand if so, will it do\nso by what mechanism?\nSo I'm pretty sure that if\nyou took a thousand people\nwith my particular injury,\nand injected them with stem cells,\nit wouldn't do a thing, because\nof the nature of my injury.\nI had a complete labral tear.\nAre there some injuries\nthat might benefit from it?\nYeah, possible.\nSo the question is, how\nwould you design the trial\nto narrow down your patient\npopulation correctly,\nso that you might see a signal?\n'Cause the other risk of doing a trial is\nyou have too much of a\nheterogeneous patient population.\nYou don't know what the\nheck you're really doing,\nand you get meaningless results.\nYou get a null result, when in\nfact there's a small signal,\nbut you were underpowered to\npick it up because, you know,\nyou only had 10% of\nyour patient population\nthat was the right patient\npopulation to get that.\nSo, you know, will we ever get there?\nI don't know,\nbecause I don't see what\nthe incentive is, right.\nYou have people who are\nmaking money hand over fist,\ndoing procedures on the\nbasis of I'm not sure what,\nwhat would their\nmotivation or incentive be\nto sort of see this legitimized?\nYou'd really have to be able to say,\nwell, there really needs to be sort of\na pharma angle to this.\nIt's sort of one of the\nwishes I had, right?\nLike if I was a billionaire,\nI feel like the way I would\nprobably waste all of my money\nwould be running clinical trials on stuff\nnobody cared about.\n- Yeah.\n- It would just be-\n- Likewise, I will join\nyou, because that would be,\nyesterday we recorded a sit\ndown with somebody from Caltech\nwho works on aggression and rage,\nand other things related to that,\nand has identified peptides\nthat are approved the FDA\nfor other reasons that\nseem to adjust anxiety,\nmight even adjust aggression\nand pathologic aggression,\nand went off on to a\nlong description of why\nnone of these drugs exist on the market\nfor the treatment of psychiatric illness,\nand yet probably would work.\nAnd what's missing is a billionaire,\nor a billion dollar company,\nthat is willing to invest in something\nthat very likely will work,\nbut the market value isn't quite there.\nOr it failed in a previous trial,\nand so no one wants to touch\nit with a 10-foot pole.\nHopefully someone listening\nto this will be incentivized\nto provide this sort of a venue for that.\nThe kind of work that we're talking about.\nI have to ask.\n- But I want to make one other\npoint, Andrew, which is, to me,\nthe problem with a lot of\nthese things is it gets,\nit's a crutch.\nYou know, it's sort of like\nwhat we talked about with like,\nhey, just fix my T man, and\neverything's going to be fine.\nAnd it's like, no, that's\njust the beginning.\nYou know, what I worry\nabout when I see people\nwho are clamoring for this stuff is\na lot of times they don't realize that,\nwhether it's psychologically or otherwise,\nthey sort of say, well, now\nthat I've had this thing done,\nI don't have to do the hard\nwork of the real rehab.\nI mean, if I've learned anything\nthrough my shoulder surgery,\nand I'm now 3 1/2 months out.\n- How does it feel?\n- Amazing.\nI mean, look, I still\ncan't do a lot of stuff.\nIt's going to be, you know, a while.\nI haven't even been\nable to shoot a bow yet.\nAnd it'll probably be a\nyear before I'll go back to,\nyou know, long dead hangs\nand heavy deadlifts.\nI mean, I dunno, maybe nine months.\nBut it's, you know, I'm not there yet.\nBut what I learned through\na really amazing prehab\nand rehab process is,\nlike you just got to do the\nwork, and it's freaking hard.\nShoulders are the most tedious,\nboring thing in the world.\nI mean, three days a week I am doing,\nfour days a week I am doing one\nhour of just dedicated stuff\nfor this shoulder, that\nis super uncomfortable,\nsuper boring, super frustrating.\nBut, I mean, I have faith\nin the methodology, right.\nAnd I think a lot of people are saying,\njust shoot the stem cells into me\nand I don't have to do any of that stuff.\nAnd the reality of it is,\nI think that's a very\ndangerous place to be.\n- Have you ever tried BPC-157?\n- Yeah, we tried it.\nWe had, you know, again,\nmaybe seven, eight years ago,\nwe had a bunch of patients ask about it,\nso, you know, my view is, okay,\nI was pretty convinced that\nthere was no safety downside\nto it so I was like, well,\nI wouldn't prescribe it to a patient\nunless I tried it myself.\nSo me and another doc\nin the practice, Ralph,\nwe did it for, I don't\nknow, a couple months.\nI didn't notice a single thing.\n- Interesting.\nWell, thank you for that.\nShifting to a less esoteric, but,\nand I think probably more\nimportant topic overall.\nMetabolomics.\nWe're talking about this\nbefore we sat down to record.\nWhat is, what are metabolomics?\nWhy should we be thinking about them?\nI have some idea of\nwhat it might be about,\nbut most people I think\nare not thinking about\nmetabolomics at all.\nAnd for those that are, I'm\nsure they could learn more.\nSo tell us about metabolomics\nand what you'd like to see more of\nin the world of metabolomics.\n- Yeah, so omics is just\nthe term that we use\nto describe the study of something.\nSo genomics right, is like\nthe broad study of genes,\nand, you know, proteomics,\nthe broad study of proteins\nand things like that.\nSo metabolomics is just\nstudy of metabolites,\nand metabolites, unlike a\nlot of these other things,\nthey're a relatively finite\nnumber of these things,\nmany of which are known, but\nsome of which are not known.\nSo glucose is a metabolite.\nAcetyl-CoA is a metabolite.\nLactate is a metabolite.\nAnd so the question is, what\ndo we know about these things\nand how they work?\nAnd more importantly,\nwhat do we know about\ncertain physiologic states,\nand the metabolomic profile\nthat results from them?\nSo let's use two extreme\nexamples, like exercise.\nEverybody understands, the\ndata are unambiguously clear,\nexercise produces about\nthe most favorable phenotype imaginable.\nSo if you wanted to\ntake a genomics approach\nto understanding that, you might look at,\nis there a change in the\ngenome when you exercise?\nAnd the answer is probably not,\nbut maybe if you looked at\nthe methylation patterns\nand epigenome, you could\nlook at epigenomic studies.\nBut you might instead look at kind of\nthe proteomic side of that.\nLike, what is gene expression doing?\nAnd there you would see a lot of changes.\nWell, what I don't think people\nare really understanding,\nalthough there was a\nvery interesting paper\nthat just came out two weeks ago\nthat looks for novel\nmetabolites that are changing,\nis they're a huge signal\nin a metabolomic profile\nthat looks different in\nthe state of exercise\nversus non-exercise.\nAnd could that represent part of\nhow exercise is transmitting\nits benefit through the body?\nYou know, people always talk about\nthe holy grail of metabolomics would be\ncan you find a pill to mimic exercise?\nAnd I think the answer to that question\nis going to be undoubtedly no.\nFor a couple of reasons.\nOne, even if you could mimic the\nlongevity sort of lifespan parts of it,\nyou could never mimic the\nhealth span parts of it.\nBut what if you could do both, right?\nWhat if there were small\nmolecules that can replicate\nsome of the protective\nbenefits of exercise,\nand you could combine those with exercise?\nWhat if those could be treatments\nfor other disease states,\nlike diabetes, things like that?\nSo that's why I think\nthis field of metabolomics\nis relatively untapped,\nand I think potentially\nthe next sort of frontier.\n- Speaking of frontiers,\nI hear a lot nowadays about\nGLP-1 and pharmacology,\nthat prescription drugs\nthat mimic or increase\nGLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide.\nPeople are talking about this as\nthe blockbuster obesity drug.\nI haven't heard this\nmuch talk about a drug\nto adjust human body weight favorably,\nsince the discussions of\nfen-phen when I was in college,\nand then of course fen-phen\nwas pulled from the market\nbecause people were dying.\nNot left and right, but enough people died\nthat they pulled it from the market.\n- Which, by the way, is\nan interesting story.\nYou know, it was the enantiomer\nthat they chose to use\nthat was the wrong enantiomer.\nAnd what it resulted in was,\nGod, I think it was like.\n- Was it mitral valve prolapse?\n- It was an MVP, yeah, it was\nsomething in the mitral valve.\nYeah, I think the chordae\ntendineae were rupturing\nin the mitral valve,\nand it was mostly young\nwomen I think were getting,\nyou know, horrible pulmonary\ndisease as a result of it.\nProbably pulmonary hypertension\nor something like that.\nBut there were, you know,\nthere were two enantiomers of the drug,\nand had they just used the other one,\nthis issue wouldn't have happened.\nAnd there was a stupid reason\nwhy they made the choice\nto use the one they did.\nAnd it's one of those things where\nonce you make the mistake,\nyou're never going back.\nIt's not like that company\ncould say, okay, wait,\nwe want to do over,\nbut we're going to do it\nwith the right version.\nSo it's a tragic outcome.\nBut you're absolutely right.\nI think the GLP-1 agonists\nhave more efficacy, and,\nyou know, for all intensity\nand for everything we can see,\ncertainly seem safer.\n- Are you excited about them?\n- Yeah, I am, yeah.\nI mean, I think we're\njust seeing the kind of\ntip of the iceberg.\nThey're not miracle drugs, right.\nThey come with problems,\nright, which is, you know,\nthey're catabolic across the board.\nSo patients are losing fat,\nbut they're losing muscle as well.\nSo, you know-\n- You just sent all the\ngym jockeys running from\n[indistinct], that's all you have to say.\nAll you have to say nowadays\nabout something is that\nit's going to drop\ntestosterone, lower fertility,\nchange someone's skin, hair or\nnails, and it's like people,\nit could extend life\nto being 250-years-old\nand people are gone.\nHumans are humans.\nThat's a neuroscience\nand psychology issue,\nnot a biology medicine issue.\nBut I'm pleased to hear\nthat you're excited by them,\n'cause I hear a lot of excitement.\nI haven't heard anything\ndisastrous about them.\n- It takes a while to\nget people up to dose.\nSo if you're looking at semaglutide,\nthe dose that was studied,\nso did a one-year trial,\nor maybe it was a little\nover that, maybe 60 weeks.\nBut it took about 16\nweeks to get the patients\ncomfortably up to 2.4 milligrams weekly,\nwhich was the dose that\nthey ultimately stayed on.\nIn our experience, when we use it,\nwe don't even usually\ngo up to 2.4 milligrams.\nWe can usually get enough benefit\nbetween one and two milligrams.\nAnd we usually move people\nalong a little bit quicker.\nBut we've definitely had\nour share of patients\nwho can't tolerate it due to the nausea.\n- Interesting.\n- Which might be part of\nhow it's working, right,\nis the sort of suppression of appetite,\nwhich, if taken to an\nextreme can produce nausea.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah, I think most of\nthe effect of semaglutide\nis central, not peripheral.\n- Huh.\nSo I don't know, I saw\none paper that GLP-1\nis acting both on cells in the periphery,\nto cause gut distention in some ways,\nor sort of make people feel full,\nthrough promotion of\nliterally mechanical receptors\nthat make people feel as if\ntheir stomach is distended,\neven though their stomach is empty.\nAnd then perhaps some\ncentral hypothalamic effects.\nIs that what-\n- Yeah, I think it's doing,\nI would bet 80% of it's\nin the hypothalamus.\nIt is also improving insulin\nsensitivity in the periphery,\nbut I don't think that\nthat's accounting for\nmuch of its benefit.\n- Super interesting.\n- And there's next gen versions of these\nthat seem to be more long-lasting.\nSo right now, if you look\nat coming off semaglutide,\nyou're going to see a weight regain.\nSo there's newer versions\nthat seem to preserve the\nweight loss, even off the drug.\nSo it begs the ultimate\nquestion, which is like,\nwhat's the total use case\nfor this going to be?\nIs this going to be a\ndrug you cycle on and off?\nOr is it going to be a drug\nthat a person has to stay\non indefinitely, and if so,\nwill they become tachyphylactic?\nWill they gain resistance to it?\nSo it's still super early\ndays on these things.\n- My hope is that it\nwould be a little bit like\nthe way that you describe\ntestosterone and estrogen therapies,\nthat it would allow people to\ndo more of the behavioral work\nthat's absolutely required\nfor health span and lifespan.\n- Yep, and we've also seen,\non the flip side of that,\nyou can cheat through semaglutide, right?\nYou can drink a lot of calories,\nand sort of get around the drug.\nSo, you know, for example, like, you know,\nwe always encourage patients\nwho want to lose weight\nto really just eliminate alcohol.\nThat's like, that's the\ncheapest, easiest trick\nto lose weight.\nAnd so if you're still\ndrinking a lot of alcohol,\nwhich is incredibly caloric,\nand just drinking a lot of caloric stuff,\nwe've seen that that's less,\nthis is just anecdotal with our patients,\nbut we've seen that that's,\nit's easier to get around the\nbenefits of the drug that way.\n- Interesting.\nI so appreciate your answers today.\nFirst of all, they were\nincredibly thorough\nand pointed towards\nreal world application.\nI also just want to thank you more broadly\nfor the work that you do,\nbecause obviously you have this\nincredible clinical experience\nand patient population\nthat you work very closely with.\nBut I see you really as one of the few,\nboth clinicians, and I\nrealize you're an MD,\ndid you do a PhD as well?\nNo, but I consider you\na scientist clinician,\na clinician scientist\nis the appropriate\nwording of that of course,\nin the way that you really still\ndrill into studies in detail.\nI know a lot of clinicians,\nnot all of them do that for sure.\nAnd the fact that you're so hungry\nfor the new incoming knowledge,\nas well as the old literature.\nSo, it's an incredibly rich\ndata set in that brain of yours,\nand I really appreciate\nyou sharing it with us,\nboth in your podcast,\nin the upcoming book,\nwhich I think that we'll\ncertainly have you on here again\nin anticipation of that.\nBut I know I, and a ton of other people,\nare really excited for the book.\nAnd in the way that you\napproach social media\nand your podcast and going on podcasts.\nSo thank you so much.\nI learned a ton, I know\neveryone learned a ton.\n- Thanks Andrew.\nGreat
