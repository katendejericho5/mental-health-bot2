    "transcript": "- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[bright music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we're talking all about sleep\nand how to optimize your sleep.\nThis is a topic we've covered\npreviously on this podcast\nin the episode called \"Master Your Sleep.\"\nHowever, since the airing of that episode,\nthere's been some terrific\nnew science to come out.\nI've also received thousands,\nyes, literally thousands of questions\nrelated to the specific\nprotocols covered in that episode\nas well as in the episode\non jet lag and shift work.\nAnd while today's episode\nis not specifically about\njet lag and shift work,\nwe are going to cover tools\nthat will allow you to shift your schedule\nif you need to for work or travel,\nand we will also cover tools\nthat will allow you to fall back asleep\nif you happen to wake up\nin the middle of the night\nor if you get a poor night's sleep,\nhow to actually recover\nfrom that poor night's sleep more quickly,\nand yes, indeed, even replace\nsleep that you've lost.\nSo today's episode is going to be filled\nwith practical tools.\nWe will touch on some of\nthe underlying science,\nbut it's really designed\nto be a practical toolkit\nfor optimizing your sleep\ndepending on your specific sleep needs.\nVarious times throughout today's episode,\nI will refer to studies that\nform the backbone of the tools\nthat I'll be describing.\nBut whereas most of the\npodcast episodes here\ntend to be deep scientific\nmechanism and then tools,\nscientific mechanism, then tools,\ntoday I'm mainly going to\nfocus on the practical tools\nthat anyone, indeed, all\npeople, I believe, should use\nin order to optimize their sleep.\nWhy should everybody want\nto optimize their sleep\nand put considerable effort\ninto optimizing their sleep?\nWell, put simply, sleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical health,\nand performance of all kinds,\ncognitive performance, physical\nperformance, et cetera.\nIt also controls things\nlike our immune system,\nwound healing, our skin\nhealth and our appearance,\nwhether or not we can\nthink clearly or not,\nwhether or not we will live as long\nas we possibly can or not,\nwhether or not we suffer\nfrom dramatic age-related\ncognitive decline or not.\nIn other words, whether or not\nwe keep our memory as we age.\nI could go on and on\nabout all the terrible things\nthat can happen to somebody\nif they don't sleep well.\nThanks to the great work\nof Professor Matt Walker\nat University of California, Berkeley,\nand the wonderful book that\nhe wrote, \"Why We Sleep,\"\nI think the world is largely onboard now\nthat sleep is critical to our health,\nour mental health, our physical\nhealth, and our performance,\nbut what's not often discussed\nis how great life is,\nthat is, how much more\nfocused and energetic\nand how positive our mood gets,\nwhen we are sleeping for the\nappropriate amount of time\nat the appropriate depth\nand when we are doing that regularly.\nBasically everything in life gets better\nwhen we're sleeping well.\nSo today I'm going to teach you the tools\nthat will allow you to\noptimize your sleep.\nThat is, get to sleep and stay asleep,\nfall back asleep if you wake\nup in the middle of the night,\nand adjust your sleep\ngiven the various life demands\nyou may be experiencing.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all, they ship internationally,\nbecause we know that\nmany of you are located\noutside of the United States.\nThat's valuable.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none,\nboth in terms of purity\nand precision of the\namounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single-ingredient supplements\nand that are supplied in dosages\nthat allow you to build a\nsupplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add things\nand remove things from your protocol\nin a way that's really\nsystematic and scientific.\nThis is really hard to do\nif you're taking blends\nof different supplements\nor if the dosages are such\nthat you can't titrate,\nor that is, adjust the\ndosages of a given supplement.\nSo by using single-ingredient supplements,\nyou can really build\nout the supplement kit\nthat's ideal for you\nand your specific needs.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partner with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere you'll see those supplements.\nAnd just keep in mind that\nwe are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost-to-consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better meet your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays, with the\nadvent of modern DNA test,\nyou can also get insight\ninto, for instance, what\nyour biological age is\nand compare that to\nyour chronological age.\nAnd, of course, your biological age\nis really the age that counts.\nThe problem with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there, however,\nis that you get information back\nabout the levels of metabolic factors,\nlipids, hormones, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes that\nall very easy to navigate.\nThey have a personalized platform.\nSo this is a web portal where you can go,\nyou'll see the numbers from\nyour blood tests and DNA tests,\nand then it will tell you, for instance,\nhow you could adjust various\naspects of your nutrition\nor your exercise or supplementation\nin order to bring those numbers\ninto the ranges that are best for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nwith cooling, heating, and\nsleep tracking capabilities.\nIt turns out that your body temperature\nand your ability to fall and stay asleep\nare very closely related.\nIf your body does not drop\nby one to three degrees,\nyou are simply not going\nto get into deep sleep\nor stay in deep sleep.\nAnd waking up, it also turns out,\nis related to body temperature.\nEvery time you wake up in the morning,\nyour body is warming up\nin order to wake you up,\nand this has an enormous number\nof hormonal and metabolic\nand other cascades that\nare vitally important,\nnot just to what happens while you sleep,\nbut your health and your energy\nand focus throughout the day.\nEight Sleep is an incredible device.\nIt's one that I've been\nusing for six months or so,\nand it's completely transformed my sleep.\nAnd I already thought I\nwas sleeping pretty well.\nThe way it works is that you\ncan cool or heat your mattress\naccording to different\ntimes throughout the night.\nSo for instance, you\ncan cool your mattress\nif you tend to run warm\nand that will help you\nfall and stay deeply asleep\nand then toward morning,\nyou can have the mattress programmed\nor, I should say, the\nmattress cover programmed,\nso that you warm up your\nsleeping environment\nand you wake up when you want to wake up.\nIf you've been sleeping pretty well\nbut waking up in the middle of the night,\nyou might also find\nthat by cooling your mattress even further\ntoward the middle of your sleep about,\nwell, you'll stay in\ndeep sleep much longer.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com/huberman\nto check out the Pod Pro Cover\nand save $150 at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nwithin the US, Canada,\nand the United Kingdom.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman\nto save $150 at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nin order to get your brain and\nbody to function at its best,\nbut none of the things you don't,\nin particular, sugar.\nElectrolytes are vitally important\nto the way that your neurons,\nyour nerve cells, work\nand, indeed, to the way\nthat all the cells of your body work.\nBut your nervous system and your neurons\nparticularly depend on electrolytes\nbecause you need the electrolytes,\nsodium, magnesium, and potassium,\nin the proper ratios,\nin order for those nerve cells\nto fire what are called action potentials,\nwhich are the electrical signals\nthat allow your neurons to work\nand to allow you to do everything\nfrom remembering information\nto moving your muscles deliberately.\nWhen you exercise, or even if you don't,\nyou can get quite low on electrolytes,\nespecially on a hot day.\nYou can get dehydrated.\nThere are lot of different ways\nto replenish your fluids and electrolytes\nand there are a lot of different\nelectrolyte drinks out there,\nbut many of them contain a lot of sugar.\nAnd some of those that\ndon't contain a lot of sugar\ndon't have the proper ratios\nof sodium, magnesium, and potassium.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's L-M-N-T, .com/huberman\nto claim a free LMNT Sample Pack\nwith your first purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free sample pack.\nLet's talk about sleep and\ntools to optimize your sleep.\nI want you to conceptualize yourself\nas contained within a room\nthat has only very few windows\nor very few entry points.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nWell, your brain and your\nnervous system control\nwhether or not you move or don't move.\nThey control whether or\nnot you're digesting food\nor you're not digesting food.\nThey control whether or not\nyou're stressed or not stressed,\nhappy or sad, et cetera.\nAll of that stuff that\ncontrols all that stuff\nis housed inside your\nskin and skull, et cetera.\nThat might seem pretty obvious,\nbut what that means is that\nfor your brain and body\nto feel alert and focused,\nready to move and\nexercise or do some work,\nor if your brain body are going\nto lie down and go to sleep,\nwell, that brain and body\nneeds cues, it needs inputs,\nto determine when to do\nthose different things.\nAnd those cues and inputs arrive\nthrough a defined set of\nwhat I'll call stimuli,\nbut you can also think of\nthese as levers or tools.\nThe main levers and tools\nthat are going to allow you\nto control when you are\nawake and when you are asleep\nand to get better sleep every single night\nare light, literally\nphotons, light energy,\ncould be from sunlight, could\nbe from artificial light,\nwe will discuss those\nparticulars in a moment,\nas well as darkness.\nThat is the absence of light.\nSo we've got light and dark.\nThose are two very powerful tools\nto encourage your nervous system\nto be in one state or another,\nmeaning awake or asleep.\nTemperature is another tool or lever.\nTurns out that when your\nbody is cooling down,\nyou have a greater tendency\nto fall and stay asleep.\nIn fact, every night\nwhen you actually sleep,\nyour body is dropping\nby one to three degrees\nand that drop in temperature is required.\nIt's like a gate that your\nbody has to go through\nin order for you to get into sleep.\nAnd in fact, the converse is also true.\nIf your body heats up by\none to three degrees or so,\nyou will wake up.\nSo you've got light,\ndark, temperature, food.\nAnd when we say food,\nwe mean what we eat, when we eat,\nand the amount that we eat.\nOkay, so light, dark,\ntemperature, food, exercise.\nAnd of course, exercise\ncomes in different forms.\nWe can do cardiovascular exercise\nthat can be low-intensity,\nlong-distance exercise.\nIt can be high intensity,\nso-called high intensity\ninterval training.\nIt could be weight\ntraining. It could be yoga.\nIt could be swimming, any\nnumber of different activities.\nBut exercise, in general, causes\nan increase in body temperature\nand tends to make us more alert,\nnot just during the exercise,\nbut in the immediate\nhours after that exercise.\nExercise does some other things\nthat relate to our sleep as well\nand we'll talk about those today\nand how you can leverage them.\nAnother potent lever\nfor adjusting your sleepiness\nand wakefulness is caffeine.\nThis, of course, comes\nas no surprise to people,\nbut why and how caffeine works\nmight come as a surprise.\nVery briefly, we have a molecule\nin our body called adenosine\nand the longer we have been awake,\nthe more adenosine builds\nup in our brain and body\nand adenosine is part of the\nreason why we get sleepy.\nCaffeine effectively operates\nas a adenosine antagonist.\nIt works by basically occupying\nthe receptor for adenosine.\nSo it's a little bit of\na convoluted mechanism.\nBut basically all you need to know\nis that caffeine prevents\nthe actions of adenosine.\nThat's one of the reasons why\ncaffeine makes us feel alert.\nBut how much caffeine we drink\nand when we drink caffeine turns\nout to be vitally important\nfor adjusting our wakefulness\nand for optimizing our sleep.\nSo we'll talk about that as well.\nThe other category of lever or tools\nwhich are immensely powerful\nfor optimizing sleep\nare supplements.\nThere now exist as many as\neight different supplements\nthat can powerfully modulate\nsleep in healthy ways\nand that have huge margins for safety.\nSo we're going to talk about\nwhat those supplements are.\nIn previous episodes of this podcast\nand as a guest on other podcasts,\nI've talked about three\nparticular supplements,\nmagnesium threonate,\napigenin, and theanine,\nwhich together can really enhance\nthe speed at which one falls asleep\nand people's ability to stay asleep\nand to really get into\nthose deep stages of sleep\nthat are particularly restorative.\nToday we're going to\ntalk a little bit more\nabout each of those three\nand how they can best\nbe used in combination,\nbut we are also going to touch\non some other supplements\nthat I have not talked about\nmuch before, if at all.\nThings like glycine and\nGABA, as well as inositol.\nMany people are going to\nfind inositol interesting\nand of particular use to them,\nespecially if they're following\na low-carbohydrate diet\nor if they are fasting before sleep\nor just trying to avoid\neating too close to bedtime\nand yet they're having a\nhard time falling asleep.\nInositol also turns out\nto be especially useful\nfor people who have a tendency\nto wake up in the middle of the night\nand have a hard time falling back asleep.\nIt also has some interesting\nand potent effects\non anxiety throughout the day.\nSo we're going to talk about\ninositol as a tool as well.\nAnd then last in our list\nof general categories\nof levers and tools for optimizing sleep\nare digital tools.\nNow, when we say digital tools,\nI don't necessarily mean devices.\nWhat I mean are things like\nnon-sleep deep rest scripts.\nThese are zero-cost\nscripts that you listen to\nthat take your body through\nsome deep relaxation\nand that can help people both\nfall asleep, stay asleep,\nfall back asleep, and\nget better at sleeping.\nAnd also going to talk about digital tools\nrelated to self-hypnosis.\nThis is distinctly different\nfrom stage hypnosis.\nSo I know some of you hear\nhypnosis and you think,\noh, you know, people\nclucking like chickens\nand doing things that are\noutside their control.\nThat's not at all what\nI'm referring to here.\nI'm talking about clinically\nand research-supported tools\nthat have been shown to\nenhance people's ability\nto fall and stay asleep\nand that can get you\nfar better at sleeping.\nSo again, to recap the\nlist of levers and tools,\nwe've got light and dark,\nand that includes the intensity of light,\nthe timing of light, et cetera.\nWe've got temperature.\nWe have food.\nWe have exercise, caffeine,\nsupplements, and digital tools,\nnot just limited to devices,\nbut zero-cost tools that\nyou can access on YouTube\nand elsewhere in various apps\nthat can really help\nyou optimize your sleep.\nSo today we're going to\ntalk about all of these.\nI really want to provide you\nas many tools as possible,\ngive you the logic behind\neach of those tools\nand when and how best to apply them\nso that you can develop the sleep toolkit\nthat's ideal for your sleep needs.\nAs we head into our description\nof tools for optimizing sleep,\nlet's consider what the\nperfect 24-hour cycle\nwould look like.\nLet's start this 24-hour cycle\nwith when you wake up in the morning.\nSo for some of you, that will be 5:00 a.m.\nFor others of you, that will be 10:00 a.m.\nMost people, I believe, wake up\nsometime between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m.\nBut regardless of when you\nwake up in the morning,\none of the first things that happens\nis that your body\ntemperature is increasing\nand that's just going to happen naturally.\nSome of it is going to be the consequence\nof your moving around a bit,\nbut really the increase\nin body temperature\nis one of the main triggers\nfor why you woke up in the first place.\nThat increase in body temperature\nin turn causes an increase\nin the release of a\nhormone called cortisol.\nCortisol is often discussed\nas a stress hormone,\nbut it's not just associated with stress.\nIt also enhances your immune system\nprovided cortisol is\nelevated at the right times,\nand the right time for\ncortisol to be elevated\nis when you first wake up in the morning.\nThat increase in cortisol\nis also going to increase metabolism.\nIt's also going to increase\nyour ability to focus mentally\nand for you to move your body.\nSo again, cortisol is often demonized\nand consider this bad thing.\nAnd indeed, you don't want cortisol\nto be chronically or consistently elevated\nthroughout the day or night.\nBut you do want cortisol to\nreach its peak early in the day\nright about the time you wake up.\nOne way that you can ensure\nthat that cortisol peak\noccurs early in the day\nright about the time that you wake up\nis to view bright light,\nideally from sunlight,\nwithin the first 30 to\n60 minutes after waking.\nThat's right, view bright sunlight\nwithin the first 30 to\n60 minutes after waking.\nI'll get into all the caveats\nabout what happens if you\nwake up before the sun is out,\nwhat if you live in the\nUK where there is no sun,\nor people claim there is no sun.\nHate to tell you this, folks,\nbut there is sun in the UK.\nWe'll talk about all that.\nBut everybody, whether or not\nyou live in a cloudy place\nor a sunny place,\nwhether or not there's\ncloud cover or not that day,\nshould really strive to get\nbright light in your eyes,\nideally from sunlight,\nwithin the first 30 to\n60 minutes after waking.\nThe reason for that is very simple.\nYou want to trigger that cortisol increase\nto occur very early in your day,\nand you don't want that\ncortisol peak to happen later,\nwhich is what will happen\nif you wait to get\noutside and see sunlight.\nThe reason for this\nis that you have a set of\nneurons, nerve cells, in your eye.\nThey're called\nintrinsically photosensitive\nmelanopsin cells,\nbut you do not need to know that name.\nThose neurons respond\nbest to bright light,\nand especially right after\nwaking early in the day,\nthey are best able to\nsignal to a set of neurons\nthat reside over the roof of your mouth\ncalled the suprachiasmatic nucleus,\nwhich is a cluster of neurons\nthat then sends a huge\nnumber of other signals,\nelectrical and chemical,\nout to your entire body\nthat triggers that cortisol increase,\nprovides a wake-up signal\nfor your brain and body,\nand sets in motion a timer\nfor you to fall asleep later that night.\nSo again, we're not trying to go into\ntoo much mechanism today.\nWe are trying to really hammer on tools\nand I'll substantiate those tools\njust a bit with some mechanism.\nBut here's what you do, or\nat least here's what I do.\nI wake up in the morning and\nI want to reach for my phone,\nbut I know that even if I were\nto crank up the brightness\non that phone screen,\nit's not bright enough to\ntrigger that cortisol spike\nand for me to be at my\nmost alert and focused\nthroughout the day\nand to optimize my sleep at night.\nSo what I do is I get out\nof bed and I go outside.\nAnd if it's a bright, clear day\nand the sun is low in the sky\nor the sun is, you know,\nstarting to get overhead,\nwhat we call low solar angle,\nthen I know I'm getting\noutside at the right time.\nIf there's cloud cover\nand I can't see the sun,\nI also know I'm doing a good thing\nbecause it turns out,\nespecially on cloudy days,\nyou want to get outside\nand get as much light energy\nor photons in your eyes.\nBut let's say it's a very clear day\nand I can see where the sun is.\nI do not need to stare\ndirectly into the sun.\nIf it's very low in the\nsky, I might do that\nbecause it's not going to\nbe very painful to my eyes.\nHowever, if the sun is\na little bit brighter\nand a little bit higher in the sky,\nsometimes it could be painful to look at.\nSo the way to get this sunlight\nviewing early in the day\nis to look toward the sun.\nIf it's too bright to look at directly,\nwell, then don't do that.\nYou just look toward it,\nbut not directly at it.\nIt's absolutely fine to blink.\nIn fact, I encourage you to blink\nwhenever you feel the impulse to blink.\nNever look at any light,\nsunlight or otherwise,\nthat's so bright that\nit's painful to look at\n'cause you can damage your eyes.\nBut for this morning sunlight viewing,\nit's best to not wear sunglasses,\nthat's right, to not wear sunglasses,\nat least for this\nmorning sunlight viewing.\nIt is absolutely fine to wear\neyeglasses or contact lenses,\nso-called corrective lenses.\nIn fact, those will serve you well\nin this practice or this tool\nbecause they will focus the\nlight onto your neural retina\nand onto those melanopsin\nintrinsically photosensitive\nganglion cells.\nIf your eyeglasses or contact lenses\nhave UV protection, that's okay.\nThere's so many different\nwavelengths of light\ncoming from the sun\nand they are bright enough\nthat they will trigger the mechanisms\nthat you want triggered\nat this early time of day.\nSo try and get outside,\nideally within the first\nfive minutes of waking\nor maybe it's 15 minutes,\nbut certainly within the\nfirst hour after waking.\nI want to share with you\nthree critical things\nabout this tool of\nmorning sunlight viewing.\nFirst of all, this is not\nsome woo biology thing.\nThis is grounded in the\ncore of our physiology.\nThere are literally\nhundreds, if not thousands,\nof quality peer-reviewed papers\nshowing that light\nviewing early in the day\nis the most powerful stimulus\nfor wakefulness throughout the day\nand it has a powerful, positive impact\non your ability to fall\nand stay asleep at night.\nSo this is really the\nfoundational power tool\nfor ensuring a great night's sleep\nand for feeling more awake during the day.\nSecond of all, if you wake\nup before the sun is out,\nyou can, and probably should,\nflip on artificial lights\nin your internal home\nenvironment or apartment\nor wherever you happen to live\nif your goal is to be awake, right?\nIf you wake up at four in the morning\nand you need to be awake,\nwell, then turn on artificial lights.\nOnce the sun is out, however,\nonce the sun has risen,\nthen you still want to get\noutside and view sunlight.\nSome of you will wake up\nbefore the sun comes out.\nAnd if you're asking whether or not\nturning on artificial lights\ncan replace sunlight at those hours,\nunfortunately, the answer is no.\nUnless you have a very special light,\nand we'll talk about what kind of light,\nthe bright artificial lights\nin your home environment\nare not, I repeat, are not\ngoing to be sufficiently bright\nto turn on the cortisol mechanism\nand the other wake-up mechanisms\nthat you need early in the day.\nThe diabolical twist, however,\nis that those lights in\nyour home or apartment\nor even on your phone\nare bright enough to disrupt your sleep\nif you look at them too late at night\nor in the middle of the night.\nSo there's this asymmetry in\nour retinal, our eye biology,\nand in our brain's biology,\nwhereby early in the\nday, right around waking,\nyou need a lot of light, a lot of photons,\na lot of light energy,\nand artificial lights\ngenerally just won't accomplish\nwhat you need them to accomplish.\nBut at night, even a little\nbit of artificial light\ncan really mess up your\nso-called circadian,\nyour 24-hour clocks,\nand all these mechanisms\nthat we're talking about.\nSo if you wake up before the\nsun is out and it's still dark,\nplease turn on as many\nbright artificial lights\nas you possibly can or need,\nbut then get outside once the sun is out.\nOn cloudy days, you especially\nneed to get outside.\nI repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,\nyou especially need to get\noutside and get sunlight.\nYou just need to get more of it.\nNow, how much light and how\nmuch light viewing do you need?\nThis is going to vary\ndepending on person and place,\nliterally where you live on earth,\nwhether or not there's\na lot of tree cover,\nwhether or not you're somebody\nwho has sensitive eyes\nor less sensitive eyes.\nIt's really impossible for me\nto give an absolute prescriptive,\nbut we can give some general guidelines.\nIn general, on a clear day,\nmeaning no cloud cover\nor minimal cloud cover,\nyou want to get this sunlight\nexposure to your eyes\nfor about five minutes or so.\nCould be three minutes one day,\ncould be seven minutes the next day,\nabout five minutes.\nOn a day where there's cloud cover,\nso the sun is just\npeeking through the clouds\nor it's more dense cloud cover,\nyou want to get about 10\nminutes of sunlight exposure\nto your eyes early in the day.\nAnd on days that are\nreally densely overcast\nor maybe even are rainy,\nyou're going to want to get\nas much as 20 or 30 minutes\nof sunlight exposure.\nAnother key thing is do not, forget about,\njust don't try and get\nthis sunlight exposure\nthrough a windshield of a car or a window,\nwhether or not it's tinted or otherwise.\nIt takes far too long.\nIt's simply not going to\ntrigger the relevant mechanisms.\nYou would be standing there all day\ntrying to get enough light into your eyes\nfrom the morning sunlight\nand by then the sun\nwill have already moved\nfrom low solar angle to overhead\nand it simply won't work\nfor all sorts of mechanisms\nrelated to your circadian\nrhythm functions.\nSo just don't try and do it\nthrough a windshield,\nsunglasses, or a window.\nIt's just not going to work.\nGet outside.\nIf the weather is really bad\nor for whatever reason, safety reasons,\nyou cannot get outside,\nwell, then I suppose try\nand get near a window.\nThat would be the last, last resort.\nBut you really want to get outside\nto get this sunlight exposure.\nNow, if you live in a part of the world\nwhere it's extremely dark and overcast\nor the weather won't let you outside\nor you live in a cave\nor some other small box\nthat does not allow any\nnatural light into it\nfor whatever reason,\nwell, then you're going\nto need a replacement\nfor that sunlight.\nAnd there are sunlight\nsimulators or daylight simulators\nthat you can purchase.\nThose are quite expensive in general\nand therefore I suggest cheaper options\nthat work just as well\nbecause they get just as bright.\nThings like ring lights that are sold\nin order for people to take\nselfies and this kind of thing.\nA drawing LED tablet\nwill work pretty well.\nI actually have one of those\nand I put it on my desk all morning\neven though I still get\noutside and look at sunlight\nfirst thing in the morning,\nagain, also, especially, I\nshould say, on cloudy days.\nWe do not have any affiliation\nto any ring lights or LED\nlights or these panels.\nSo we will provide a link to\na couple of different options\nif you want to explore\nthe various options.\nI don't know what people's\ndifferent budgets are.\nI don't know where people live.\nI just know that many\nof our listeners live\nin locations throughout the world\nwhere, for instance, during the winter,\nit gets very, very dark,\nso they can't get sufficient sunlight.\nBut get that morning light,\nideally from sunlight,\nand take into account\nall the specific points\nthat I've given you here.\nAnd, I should say, enjoy this practice.\nIt's really nice to get outside\nfirst thing in the morning\nand get this sunlight.\nIn fact, when you start doing this,\nyou'll notice that your body\nwill start to feel more energized\nand it will feel more\nenergized more quickly.\nYou'll actually start\nto notice this mechanism\nkicking in each day,\nespecially if you're paying\nattention to your physiology.\nSo enjoy this practice of getting outside.\nYes, you can take your\nmorning beverage outside.\nYes, you can take your dog with you.\nIn fact, animals intuitively know\nto get this morning sunlight.\nThey actually seek it out\nat the right times of days.\nWe human beings need to be told\nby podcasters and other people\nabout the science that supports\nthese kinds of practices.\nOur pets apparently do not.\nBut get outside alone or with somebody,\nwith your kids, with your dog.\nHowever you go about this practice,\nmake sure you do this practice\nat least 80% of the days of your life.\nThat's right.\nIf you miss a day,\nfor instance, you're bedridden for a day,\ntry and get next to a window.\nLet's say you are traveling,\nor for whatever reason,\nyou are not able to get outside\nfirst thing in the morning,\nwell, then try to get twice\nas much sunlight in your eyes,\nor I should say extend the duration\nof sunlight viewing in the morning\nfor twice as long the following day.\nThis is a slow, integrative mechanism\nthat underlies this whole thing\nof wakefulness during the day\nand sleep at night due to sunlight viewing\nand if you miss a day, you can\nmake up for it the next day,\nbut you have to get twice as much light\nor twice as much duration of light.\nIf you really want to get technical\nand you really want to measure\nhow much light is in your environment,\nyou can download a free app,\nsomething like Light Meter,\nand that will allow your phone\nto act as a bit of a light meter.\nIt'll give you a pretty\naccurate measurement\nof how many lux, which is\na measure of brightness,\nare in your environment in the morning.\nAnd in general, that's just\ngoing to be a good tool\nfor evaluating your environments.\nHere's what I suggest you do.\nWake up in the morning, take Light Meter,\npoint it at the brightest\nlight in your home,\nand take a measurement,\nand what you'll probably find\nis it's about a thousand lux.\nNow go outside and if\nthere's some sunlight out\nand there's cloud cover,\npoint it at the sky and press that button.\nYou can actually hold it down\nand it'll give you a dynamically\nupdated lux measurement.\nAnd what you'll find\nis like 5,000, 10,000,\nsometimes even 90,000 lux,\neven though you don't experience\nit as so much brighter,\nand that's because an\nindoor artificial light\nis very concentrated\nover a small spatial area\nwhereas the sunlight is very diffuse.\nBut it's that diffuse,\nvery bright sunlight,\nthat photon energy,\nthat you really want\nthat's going to set all the\nrhythms of your brain and body\nin the proper way.\nNot just that cortisol peak,\nbut it's going to trigger\nproper metabolism,\nit's going to set a timer for you\nto be able to fall asleep\nabout 16 hours later,\nand on and on and on.\nAnd I should mention within\nthe on and on and on,\nit's also going to suppress any melatonin,\na hormone that makes you sleepy\nthat happens to be swimming\naround in your bloodstream\nat the time you wake up.\nIt does a number of other things too,\nincluding interact with\nthe adenosine system\nand kind of wash out some of the adenosine\nthat might still be residual\nif you didn't sleep enough.\nFundamentally speaking, get\nthat morning sunlight viewing.\nI promise you will be\ngrateful that you did.\nIt makes everybody feel\nbetter, feel more alert,\nand it will greatly\nassist with your ability\nto fall and stay asleep later that night.\nBefore we continue with\ntoday's discussion,\nwe're going to take a brief pause\nto acknowledge our sponsor,\nAthletic Greens, also called AG1.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nSo I'm delighted\nthat they've been a\nsponsor of this podcast.\nAthletic Greens contains\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics,\ndigestive enzymes, and adaptogens.\nSo it's got a lot of things in there.\nThat's actually the\nreason I started taking it\nand the reason I still take\nit once or twice a day.\nIt essentially covers all\nof my nutritional bases.\nAnd the probiotics in\nparticular are important to me\nbecause of the critical importance\nof what's called the gut-brain axis,\nthat is neurons and other\ncell types in the gut,\nin the digestive tract,\nthat communicate with the brain\nand the brain back to the digestive tract\nin order to control things like mood,\nimmune function, hormone\nfunction, and on and on.\nWhenever somebody has asked me\nwhat's the one supplement\nthey should take,\nI always answer Athletic Greens.\nI gave that answer long\nbefore I ever had this podcast\nand it's the answer I still give now\nfor all the reasons that I\ndetailed just a moment ago.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2,\nwhich are also very important\nfor a huge number of bodily\nfactors and brain factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nOkay, so now we're still focusing\non this early part of the\nday when you've woken up,\nthe first hour or so after waking.\nAnd we can go to our list of\nother levers and tools, right?\nWe have light and dark.\nWe already talked about light\nand sunlight in particular.\nWe've got temperature, food, exercise,\ncaffeine, supplements, and digital tools.\nNow, once you've woken up and\nyou want to be awake, okay?\nSo this is likely to be early in the day\nif you're following a\nmore standard schedule.\nYou will also want to\nleverage not just light,\nbut temperature as a tool.\nIf you are inclined, it would be wise\nto try and increase your\ncore body temperature\na bit more quickly than it would otherwise\nif you were to just, you\nknow, shuffle around outside,\nget your sunlight,\nmaybe read a little bit, et cetera,\nand there are two main\nways you can do that.\nThe first way is to get into\ncold water of some sort.\nSo this could be a cold shower\nof anywhere from one to three minutes.\nThis could be an ice bath\nif that's your thing.\nIt could be a cold tub,\nor if you own a cold tub\nthat's specifically designed\nfor deliberate cold exposure.\nGet under some cold water.\nThat will certainly wake you up.\nAnd if you've ever jumped into cold water\nor had a cold shower,\nyou know it really wakes you up\nbecause you release\nadrenaline, epinephrine,\nfrom both your brain and body,\nthe body from your adrenals\nand your brain from a\nlittle cluster of neurons\ncalled locus coeruleus.\nAgain, the names don't matter.\nOne to three minutes of cold\nwater exposure will wake you up\nbecause of that adrenaline release\nand, and I want to highlight the and,\nit will serve to increase\nyour core body temperature.\nThat's right, your body and brain interact\nas a bit of a thermostat system\nwhere if you put something cold\non the surface of your body,\nyour brain, a little cluster of neurons\nin the so-called medial preoptic area,\nact as a thermostat and say,\n\"Ah, the external of my body is cold\nand therefore I'm going to heat up\nmy core body temperature.\"\nSo it's a little bit paradoxical.\nPeople think, oh, if you get\ninto cold water or an ice bath,\nyour body temperature is going to drop.\nAnd indeed, that's true if\nyou stay in for a while,\nbut if you just get in for\nabout one to three minutes,\nor under the cold shower\nfor one to three minutes,\nyour core body temperature will increase.\nSo then when you get\nout of that cold water,\nyour body temperature is\nincreasing at a rate, at a slope,\nthat's steeper than it would otherwise\nand you're going to feel more alert.\nIt also has the advantage\nof increasing not just adrenaline,\nbut dopamine, which is a molecule involved\nin motivation, focus, et cetera.\nSo this is great for waking up.\nSo we've got sunlight,\nwe've got temperature\ntriggered by cold water,\nand we have exercise.\nOne of the best ways\nto increase your core body\ntemperature early in the day\nis to do exercise.\nNow, some of you might choose\nto do your full-blown workout for the day\nfirst thing when you\nwake up in the morning,\nI would say the best time to exercise,\nat least what the research points to,\nis immediately when you\nwake up in the morning\nor three hours after waking\nor 11 hours after waking.\nBut that's really getting\ndown into optimization\nfor sake of muscular\nstrength and grip strength\nand it's very hard to give\na strict prescriptive.\nHere's what I suggest.\nIf you want to be alert early in the day\nand you want to sleep great at night,\nget that bright sunlight,\nget into some cold water,\nand if you don't want to\nget into some cold water,\ntry and get some movement.\nIt could be a walk.\nSo you can get your sunlight exposure\nwhile you're taking a walk\nfirst thing in the morning.\nIt could be a light jog.\nIt could be skipping rope.\nThese days, I skip rope for\nabout 10 minutes or 20 minutes\nwhile looking at the sun.\nSo I'm trying to layer\nin these different things\nfor waking up.\nAnd then I take a cold shower afterwards.\nThis is what I've been doing as of lately,\nbut I don't do that all\nyear long necessarily.\nOr some of you are going to\nbe working out mid-morning.\nI sometimes do that.\nBut try and get your core\nbody temperature increased\nfirst thing in the morning,\nand a great way to do that\nis with the cold water\nand/or with exercise.\nAnd again, it doesn't have\nto be your full-blown workout\nfor the day\nif you're doing workouts consistently,\nwhich I hope everybody is\nbecause everybody really should exercise\nat least, I believe, five or six,\nor maybe even seven days a week.\nFor me, it's six days\na week, sometimes five,\nrarely is it seven.\nSo get that exercise\nor even just a modest amount of movement,\nwalking, jogging, skipping rope,\nsome light calisthenics.\nThat will further increase\nyour core body temperature\nand help you feel more awake.\nThen we have the category of caffeine.\nAnd again, we're just talking\nabout this early part of the day,\nand you might be saying, \"Wait a second,\nI thought this was an episode\nabout tools for sleep.\"\nWell, everything that\nwe're talking about doing\nin these first 60 to 90 minutes of the day\nreally set in motion a\nwave of biological cascades\nthat carry through the entire day\nand into the evening and into the night\nand really do serve to optimize sleep.\nSo just hang in there with me.\nAnd for those of you that are interested\nin focus and attention,\nyour ability to learn,\nall of these tools and practices\nare going to greatly\nenhance those as well.\nSo the next category of tool\nfor use early in the day is caffeine.\nCaffeine is a very important\ncompound to think about.\nI do realize that some people\nwho are prone to anxiety,\nespecially panic attacks, anxiety attacks,\nmight avoid caffeine entirely.\nThat's absolutely fine.\nYou do not have to drink caffeine.\nSo what I'm about to describe\nare ways to leverage caffeine use\nto optimize sleep and wakefulness\nif you are comfortable with\ncaffeine, if you like caffeine,\nI happen to love caffeine.\nI like it in the form\nof coffee or espresso\nor yerba mate tea,\nin particular non-smoked\nvarieties of yerba mate tea.\nNon-smoked because the smoked\nvarieties seem to carry\nsome carcinogenics, some\ncancer causing risk.\nThere's increasing data on that.\nSo non-smoked varieties of yerba mate.\nSo caffeine is something\nthat a lot of people\nconsume early in the day.\nHow much depends on your tolerance,\nand there's a lot of\nindividual variability here.\nAgain, caffeine is an\nadenosine antagonist,\nor effectively works as\nan adenosine antagonist\nand limits sleepiness.\nI highly recommend\nthat everybody delay their caffeine intake\nfor 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\nHowever painful it may\nbe to eventually arrive\nat that 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nyou want, and I encourage you,\nto clear out whatever residual adenosine\nis circulating in your system\nin that first 90 to\n120 minutes of the day.\nGet that sunlight exposure,\nget some movement to wake up,\nand then, and only then,\nstart to ingest caffeine\nbecause what you'll do if\nyou delay caffeine intake\nuntil 90 to 120 minutes after waking\nis you will avoid the\nso-called afternoon crash.\nAnd you may still get a\nlittle bit of dip in energy\nin the afternoon,\nbut it's not going to\nbe that massive crash.\nI've talked about the\nreasons for that crash\non previous episodes.\nBut if you delay your caffeine intake\n90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nyou are doing yourself a great\nservice towards wakefulness\nand to avoid the crash.\nAnd the afternoon crash has\nanother liability to it,\nwhich is typically people will emerge\nfrom that afternoon crash\neither grumpy or groggy\nand then they'll lean into\ndrinking more caffeine,\nwhich can then disrupt their sleep.\nSo wait 90 to 120 minutes\nafter waking in the morning\nto drink caffeine.\nAnd if you drink caffeine at\nany point throughout the day,\nreally try and avoid any caffeine,\ncertainly avoid drinking\nmore than a hundred milligrams\nof caffeine after 4:00 p.m.\nand probably even better to\nlimit your last caffeine intake\nto 3:00 p.m. or even 2:00 p.m.\nAnd for many people,\nshifting that caffeine intake\nfrom immediately after\nwaking in the morning\nto 90 to 120 minutes\ngives them a much longer arc\nof energy throughout the day\nand they don't feel the need\nto drink more caffeine\nlater in the afternoon.\nIf you do drink caffeine\nlater in the afternoon,\nreally try and limit the\ntotal amount or drink decaf.\nCertainly keep the total amount\nto less than a hundred milligrams\nif you are interested\nin getting into the best possible sleep.\nAnd I say this knowing that\nmany people, including myself,\ncan drink a double espresso\nwith 200 milligrams of caffeine or more\nat 5:00 p.m. or even\n6:00 p.m. or after dinner\nand still, quote,\nunquote, fall asleep fine\nor still sleep fine.\nHowever, there are terrific data,\nMatt Walker and I talked about this,\nand there are more and\nmore papers all the time\nthat point to the fact that\ncaffeine intake late in the day,\nafter 4:00 p.m. that is,\ncan really disrupt the\narchitecture of your sleep.\nSo you might think you're sleeping well,\nbut you're not sleeping\nnearly as well as you could\nif you avoided caffeine\nin those afternoon hours.\nNow, some of you might be doing\nyour main about of exercise\nfirst thing in the morning\nand you want your caffeine\nbefore that about of exercise.\nIn that case, I say, go for it.\nDrink your caffeine,\ndo your workout right after waking up.\nI don't have a problem with that.\nYou will find, however,\nthat you're going to get an\nearly afternoon dip in energy\nand that dip in energy is\ngoing to be substantial\nbecause it's going to be a dip in energy\nthat naturally follows that\nworkout from the morning.\nSo it's dependent on temperature,\nand it's going to be related\nto the elimination of that\nadenosine blockade by caffeine.\nSo you're getting a\nkind of a one-two punch\non your energy levels\nby taking a lot of caffeine and\nexercising early in the day.\nYou can sort of expect\nthat you're going to get a drop in energy\nin the early afternoon.\nThat's okay if that works for you,\nbut just know that delaying that caffeine\n90 to 120 minutes after waking\nwould be the ideal scenario\nmost days and most scenarios.\nAll that said, I\nabsolutely respect the fact\nthat people have different work schedules,\nkid schedules, et cetera.\nSo if you want to do some\nor none or all these tools,\nthat's really up to you.\nI'm just providing them to you\nin the simplest form that I\ncan possibly provide them.\nNow, the other lever or tool\nthat you have available to you is food.\nNot just what you eat, but when you eat.\nAnd it turns out that if\nyou eat early in the day,\nyou support a biological clock mechanism\nthat will make you more\nalert early in the day.\nThat said, many people choose to fast\nin the early morning hours of the day\nor in the first part of the day.\nI'm one such person.\nI generally don't ingest any food\nuntil about 11:00 a.m. or 12 noon.\nSometimes I'll have a protein shake.\nSometimes I'll have some almonds.\nSometimes I'll have breakfast.\nIf people are meeting\nfor brunch or breakfast,\nI will have breakfast for social reasons\nevery once in a while.\nBut most of the time I don't\neat until about lunch time.\nHowever, some people are really hungry\nwhen they wake up in the morning.\nJust know that if you\neat early in the day,\nyou are further triggering\nan increase in metabolism\nand in temperature that\nwill make you more alert.\nSo you don't have to eat early in the day,\nbut you can start to see\nhow these different tools layer together.\nSunlight viewing, exercise,\ncold water, eating.\nMany of them are converging\non the same mechanisms.\nIn fact, when you drink caffeine,\nthere's also a small\nincrease in body temperature\ndue to the adrenaline\nincrease that it stimulates.\nSo all of these things can be\nlayered on top of one another\nor you can use them individually\nor think about them individually.\nNow, food is an interesting lever or tool\nbecause it's not just about when you eat,\nbut it's also about what you eat.\nAnd I've talked a lot\nabout eating for energy\nand what that means in\nterms of caloric energy\nversus neural energy, et cetera,\nin previous podcast episodes.\nWe're not going to focus on that now\nbecause, frankly, to\nget into a description\nof whether or not somebody\nshould eat fruits or vegetables\nor animal proteins or dairy,\net cetera, early in the day,\nthat's very nuanced.\nWhat you eat for your breakfast,\nor if you choose to not eat breakfast,\nis really up to you.\nAll that said, if you\neat a very large meal,\nit doesn't matter if you\nslept terrifically well\n10 hours the night before\nor if you are about to go to sleep\nor if it's the middle of the afternoon,\nif your gut is full of food,\nthere's just a large\nvolume of food in your gut,\nit's going to divert a lot of blood\nand other critical resources\naway from other organs of your body,\nin particular, your brain,\nand you're going to be sleepy\nafter eating a big meal.\nSo this is sort of a duh,\nbut I think oftentimes in the discussions\nabout what to eat for energy,\npeople neglect to consider food volume\nas a strong parameter or\nvariable in that discussion.\nSo if you eat a huge breakfast,\nit's likely that you are going to be tired\nimmediately after eating that breakfast\nunless of course you exercise\nvery hard prior to that\nand you metabolize all\nthat food very quickly.\nSo it's up to you whether or not to eat\nfirst thing in the morning or not.\nBut if you do eat in the first\nfew hours of the morning,\njust understand that you are setting\nor you are helping to set\na food entrained, as it's\ncalled, circadian clock.\nLight, temperature, timing of food intake,\nmovement and exercise,\nall of these things literally\nfunnel in in a neural sense,\nthey funnel into this thing\nthat we call the circadian clock\nand they let that clock,\nthat set of neurons,\npredict when you are likely\nto be eating and active\nand viewing sunlight\nthe next day and the next\nday and the next day.\nI say all this because there\nare some beautiful studies,\nand I'll highlight one, again,\nin the show note captions,\nthat show that if people\nare having a hard time\nwaking up in the morning,\none of the things they can do\nis maximize sunlight viewing,\nexercise in the morning,\ndrink caffeine.\nAlthough, again, I support the idea\nthat that would best be done\nabout 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\nEating some food in those\nearly morning hours,\net cetera, et cetera.\nYou can layer in multiple levers or tools\nin order to be more alert.\nAnd that's what these levers\nand tools are really there for\nin this sense of what\nwe're talking about today,\nwhich is optimizing sleep.\nYes, they will make you more alert.\nYes, they will provide some\nadrenaline and dopamine,\nfor instance, the cold\nwater, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut the reason we're\ntalking about these things\nin the context of sleep\nis that they start to give your body\nsome predictable autonomic timing.\nWhat is predictable autonomic timing?\nWell, your autonomic nervous system\nis the components of your brain and body\nthat cause wakefulness and sleepiness\nand you can start to\ncreate some predictability\nin that autonomic timing.\nYou can start to do things\nthat really make it such\nthat you naturally wake\nup at six in the morning\nor five in the morning.\nThat's right, if you're somebody\nwho naturally is a night owl,\nwho likes to stay up\nuntil two in the morning\nand sleep until 10:00 a.m.,\nand you now have a job or\nyou have to go to school\nor you have a partner\nthat likes to get up early\nand go to sleep early,\nwell, you can make that happen\nand you can make that\nhappen pretty painlessly\nif you take a week or so\nand go to sleep 30 minutes or\nan hour earlier each night,\nset an alarm\nand wake up 30 minutes or\nan hour earlier each morning\nuntil, of course, you're waking up\nat the time you want to wake up,\nand then even in that groggy state,\nget some exercise, get\nsome sunlight viewing.\nIf the sun's not out,\nturn on those bright artificial lights.\nHave some breakfast, even\nif you're not hungry.\nIn fact, for those of you\nthat engage in shift work\nbecause you have to,\nor travel and you're jet lagged,\none of the quickest ways to\nshift your circadian clock\nand get onto the local schedule\nis to eat on the local schedule.\nSo what all these tools do is\nthey really set up a cascade.\nThink of it as kind of a\nwavefront of wakefulness and focus\nthroughout the day.\nIt'll take you through\nthe middle of the day\nand the afternoon stage we'll\ntalk about in a few minutes,\nbut really they take you to this period\nthat is about 5:00 p.m.\nuntil your bedtime.\nI realize some people are\ngoing to bed very early,\nlike 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m.,\nwhich to me seems very early,\nbut very few people go to\nsleep at 5:00 p.m. right?\nUnless you're doing that for\nshift work or other reasons.\nBut from 5:00 p.m. until bedtime\nis really a critical period\nin which you need to\nleverage particular tools\nin order to get and stay asleep optimally\nand to be able to sleep through the night.\nSo really there are three critical periods\nthroughout each 24-hour cycle.\nAnd during each of those critical periods,\nyou're going to want to do\nas many specific things as you can\nto optimize your wakefulness\nand focus and mood throughout the day\nand your sleep at night.\nThe first critical period\nis the one that we've been\ntalking about up until now.\nThings like morning sunlight viewing,\ncaffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nexercise, and so on.\nWe can call that critical period one\nand it really encompasses the\ntime from which you wake up\nuntil about three hours after waking.\nAlthough, I should just mention\n'cause there are always\nthose people that say,\n\"Wait, I wake up at 4:00 a.m.\nand the sun isn't out until 8:00 a.m.,\"\nokay, so it might be four hours.\nBut really it's those early\nmorning hours of your day\nonce you're awake.\nThe second critical period\nis the time throughout\nthe day and afternoon\nleading into evening.\nSo you may ask what are\nthe things that you can do\nthroughout the day,\nthe middle of your day\nand into the afternoon and evening hours,\nthat are really going to set you up\nfor the best possible\nsleep later that night.\nWell, there are a few dos\nand there are a few don'ts.\nFirst of all,\nbe careful about ingesting\ntoo much caffeine\nthroughout the middle of the day.\nThat's kind of an obvious one\nfor the reasons that we\ntalked about earlier.\nSecond of all, if you are a napper,\nand I raise my hand now,\nfor those of you listening,\nI'm raising my right\nhand because I love naps.\nI've always loved naps.\nNowadays I do NSDR or\na Reveri sleep hypnosis\nalmost every day.\nAnd I tend to do that, as I mentioned,\nin the early afternoon hours\nif I'm feeling kind of sleepy,\nbecause even though I optimize\nmy caffeine intake timing, et cetera,\nI tend to get a little\nsleepy in the afternoon.\nMost people get a little\nsleepy in the afternoon.\nSome of that is related\nto hitting that peak of body temperature.\nAnd you might think, wait, I\nthought high body temperature\nis associated with alertness,\nand it is,\nbut right as you crest\nthat high body temperature\nand your body temperature starts to drop,\nthere's a tendency to\nbe a little bit sleepy.\nSo some of you might opt to\ntake a nap in the afternoon.\nShould you nap, should you not nap?\nThat's a question that I get asked a lot\nand that I asked Dr. Matthew Walker\nwhen he was a guest on this podcast.\nHere was his answer and\nhere's what the data support.\nIt is fine to nap in the afternoon,\nbut don't nap so late in\nthe day or for so long\nthat it disrupts your ability\nto fall and stay asleep at night\nfor your major sleep about, okay?\nSo naps are fine,\nbut don't sleep so long during the day\nor too late in the day\nthat it disrupts your ability\nto fall and stay asleep.\nI should also say you do not have to nap.\nIt's kind of an interesting phenomenon\nthat happens on these\npodcasts and on social media\nwhere we'll talk about naps\nand the fact that naps are great,\nbut don't make them\nlonger than 90 minutes,\nbut then all the non-nappers\nget really worried.\nLike, wait, am I supposed to nap?\nI don't like naps. I wake up groggy.\nYou do not have to nap.\nIn fact, if you can make it\nthrough your whole day without napping,\ngreat, more power to you.\nBut if you do nap and you\nfind that naps serve you well,\nkeep those naps shorter than 90 minutes\nfor reasons related to\nultradian cycles and so forth,\nand make sure that you don't\nnap too late in the day\nthat you are then staying\nup too late at night\nand having a hard time\nwaking up the next morning.\nI will say that for a lot of\npeople who do not like naps\nor that find they wake up\nreally grumpy from naps\nor groggy from naps,\nI encourage you to try the Reveri app,\ntry an NSDR script, try yoga nidra.\nTry something of that sort\nfor anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30 minutes.\nI tend to do this every day now.\nI'll just lie down, and I love yoga nidra,\nI love NSDR scripts,\nI love using the Reveri app.\nIn particular, the\nportion of the Reveri app\nthat gets you better at sleeping.\nIt really is beneficial for me\nbecause it serves as very replenishing\nwhile I'm doing that hypnosis,\nbut it's also gotten me much better\nat falling and staying asleep\nand falling back asleep in\nthe middle of the night.\nSo this critical period throughout the day\nis one in which most people\nare doing a lot of stuff.\nThey're emailing and picking up kids\nand they're exercising\nand they're commuting\nand doing all sorts of things,\ntaking phone calls and Zooms, et cetera.\nBut if you can get that\nperiod of deep relaxation\nthrough a nap or NSDR,\nthat's going to serve you well.\nTry not to drink too much caffeine,\ncertainly no more than a\nhundred milligrams of caffeine,\nafter 4:00 p.m\nif your goal is to fall asleep\nat a reasonably normal time.\nAnd for those of you that\nexercise in the afternoon,\nunderstand that if you\nexercise very intensely,\nso this might be weight\ntraining or running\nor some other very intense exercise,\ntypically that's going to further increase\nyour body temperature.\nMakes sense, right?\nBased on everything we know\nabout metabolism and body temperature.\nAnd it's going to so-called\ndelay your circadian clock.\nIt's going to make it such\nthat you want to fall\nasleep a little bit later,\nmaybe even a lot later.\nSo if you're exercising in\nthe afternoon or evening\nand that's the only time you can exercise\nor that's the time that\nyou prefer to exercise,\ngreat, but be careful about\ningesting too much caffeine\nin order to get the\nenergy to do that exercise\n'cause that caffeine\nwill disrupt your sleep\nand just know that you are\ndelaying your circadian clock.\nYou are making it such\nthat you will naturally\nwant to go to sleep later\nand wake up later.\nContrast that with if you\nexercise early in the day,\nsay, immediately after waking up\nor in the first zero to\nfour hours after waking,\nin most cases, that's not going to shift\nyour circadian clock much.\nAnd toward the end of the episode,\nwe'll talk a little bit\nabout forced exercise\nprior to wake-up times.\nThat doesn't mean doing\nexercise in your sleep.\nThat means deliberately setting an alarm\nand getting out of bed much earlier\nthan you naturally would.\nThat turns out to be a very potent tool\nto so-called advance your circadian clock.\nSo we can talk about that a\nlittle bit later in the episode.\nBut this critical period,\ntoo, in the middle of the day\nis when you're going to want\nto leverage specific tools,\nand we've talked about those:\nlimiting caffeine intake;\nbeing mindful of the\nclock-delaying effects of exercise;\nthe fact that, also,\nif you're going to nap,\nyou don't want to nap too\nlong or too late into the day\notherwise you'll disrupt\nyour nighttime sleep.\nSo this critical period two,\nor second critical period, I should say,\nduring the middle of the day\nis a time in which you should\nbe doing certain things\nand avoiding doing certain things.\nSo that raises the\nquestion of whether or not\nyou should also be getting a lot of light,\nin particular, sunlight,\nthroughout the day.\nNow, that's something that\nhasn't been explored too much\nin the literature\nuntil recently when Dr. Samer Hattar\nwho's the director of\nthe chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health,\ndecided to do a number of experiments\nexploring the effects of light on mood\nand other aspects of brain\nfunction and body function\nwhen that light is delivered\nnot just in the morning,\nwhich is great for us,\nbut also throughout the day.\nSo should you be looking at sunlight\nor bright artificial\nlights throughout the day?\nNow, on the face of it,\nyou might just think, yes,\nyou know, sunlight's great.\nProvided we're not getting a sunburn\nand we're not staring at the\nsun and damaging our eyes,\nwe should get as much\nsunlight as we possibly can.\nIn fact, we talked about this\nin the episode on hormones\nabout how getting light\nonto as much of our skin\nas we can throughout the day\ncan really help in the production\nof testosterone and estrogen\nin both men and women\nin healthy ways that\nimproves mood and libido\nand all sorts of things that\nare associated with wellbeing.\nHowever, because light is\nsuch a powerful stimulus\nfor controlling the timing\nof your sleepfulness, or\nsleepiness, I should say,\nand wakefulness,\nwe might want to be cautious\nabout how much light we are\nviewing in the afternoon,\nin particular, in the\nearly evening hours, right?\nWell, turns out it's\nnot so straightforward.\nViewing, so sunlight to the eyes, sunlight\nin the late afternoon and evening hours,\nso again, depends on time of year,\ndepends on location that\nyou happen to be in,\nbut getting some sunlight in your eyes\nfor, again, maybe five\nor 10, maybe 30 minutes,\ndepending on how much\ncloud cover there is,\ndoing that in the afternoon\nserves an additional beneficial purpose,\nwhich is you protect or you\ninoculate your nervous system\nagainst some of the negative effects\nof bright artificial light\nor even dim artificial\nlight in the nighttime hours\nbetween 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.,\nwhich is really critical period three.\nAnd we'll talk about what\nto do and what to not do\nduring critical period three\nof every 24-hour cycle.\nBut to make it very clear\nwhat I'm saying here,\nget that morning sunlight in your eyes,\nbut also get some sunlight in your eyes\nin the late afternoon and evening hours\nwhen the sun is at\nso-called low solar angle,\nwhen it starts to descend in the sky.\nAgain, you don't have to\nstare directly at the sun,\nalthough if you can catch\na nice, beautiful sunset,\ngo for it.\nBut as the sun starts to descend,\nit triggers those same neurons in your eye\nthat communicate with\nyour circadian clock,\nbut it communicates with\na different component\nor different compartment\nwithin the circadian clock.\nThat circadian clock\nis not just one thing.\nIt's multiple things.\nAnd you have what are\ncalled morning oscillators\nand evening oscillators.\nAnd to make a long story short,\nthe tool that I'm describing\nof looking at the sun\nin the late afternoon and evening,\nagain, blinking is fine,\ndon't stare at the sun,\nbut getting that sunlight in your eyes\nin the late afternoon and evening\nsignals to that clock\nthat it's evening time\nand that sleep is coming.\nIt also serves as a second\nanchor or reference point\nfor your body and your brain\nto know where it is in time.\nRemember back to the\nbeginning of the episode\nwhen I said your brain and\nyour body and all your organs\nare locked inside this skin and this skull\nand they don't know what's\ngoing on in the outside world.\nWell, that morning sunlight viewing\nand the other things you do\nduring critical period one,\nthose provide one strong set of signals\nthat it's wake-up time\nand time to be alert\nand time to be focused.\nAnd then in the evening,\nby getting sunlight in your eyes again,\nin particular, sunlight that comes\nfrom low solar angle sunlight,\nwell, that provides a second stimulus\nor a second reference point\nthat tells your brain and\nbody, \"Hey, it's evening.\nThe sun is descending.\"\nNow, you might say,\n\"Wait, how does the brain\nand these neurons know\nthe difference between morning\nlight and evening light?\"\nIt turns out has to do\nwith the particular wavelengths of light\nthat are present in\nmorning versus evening.\nIt's an incredible mechanism.\nAnd you are probably\nfamiliar with the fact\nthat when the sun is directly overhead,\nit's really bright white and yellow\nand the sky's often blue,\nand if there's cloud cover,\nit just comes through as\na bunch of bright light,\nwell, next time you're out in the morning,\ntake a look at what a sunrise looks like.\nThere's a lot of yellow-blue contrast,\nand those yellow blues signal\nimportant specific sets of\ncells in your eye and brain\nthat it's morning.\nIn the evening, you're also\ngoing to see yellow and blue,\nbut the ratio of yellows\nand blues has now changed\nand you also see some oranges,\nand in a really brilliant\nsunset, you'll see some reds.\nIf you haven't noticed this already,\nyou'll really want to look for this.\nIt's really kind of fun\nand cool to look at.\nWell, those yellows and blues and oranges\nthat you see in the evening sunsets,\nthose signal to your brain\nand body that evening is there\nand that nighttime is coming\nand they're really establishing\na second reference point or\nwavefront of biological signals\nthat are going to optimize\nyour nighttime hours\nand your transition into\nreally terrific sleep.\nSo now let's talk\nabout what I'm calling\ncritical period three\nof each 24-hour cycle.\nSo this would be the period\nof time of late evening,\nSo it might be 6:00 p.m. for some,\ndepending on when you go to sleep,\nor 7:00 p.m.\nextending into the hours\nin which you decide to get\ninto bed and go to sleep\nand then throughout the night.\nThere are a number of things\nthat you're going to want to do\nand there are a number of things\nthat you are going to want to avoid doing\nin order to optimize your sleep.\nFirst of all, you're\ngoing to want to avoid\nbright artificial lights of any color.\nYes, of any color.\nWe haven't talked a lot\nabout blue blockers,\nyou know, lenses that\nblock blue wavelengths\nor short wavelengths of light.\nI don't have anything\nagainst blue blockers.\nIn fact, many people find that\nblue blockers provide them\nsome relief from headache\nand some eye strain\nif they wear blue blockers\nthroughout the day and certainly at night.\nBut you don't need them,\nand even if you do wear them,\nyou will find that if\nlights are very bright,\ndoesn't matter if it's a blue light,\na yellow light, or a red light,\nthose bright lights will\nwake up your brain and body.\nThey will activate the same mechanisms\nthat were activated early\nin the day by sunlight.\nHowever, and here's the\nreally diabolical twist,\nI mentioned this earlier,\nbut the diabolical twist\nin the way that your brain\nand body respond to light\nis that early in the day,\nin the morning hours, you\nneed a lot of bright light,\nideally from sunlight,\nto be very alert and to wake up,\nbut in the evening hours\nand nighttime hours,\nit takes very little\nlight, very few photons,\nin order to wake up your brain and body\nand to disrupt your circadian\nclock and disrupt your sleep.\nSo what that means is that\nonce the sun goes down,\nwhich, of course, is going to happen\nat different times of year\nin different places on earth,\nbut once the sun goes down,\nyou would be wise to\ntry and dim the lights\nin your indoor environment\nmost days, right?\nI realize some nights you're\ngoing to throw a party\nand have people over.\nYou might not want to dim the lights.\nSome nights you're going to go out,\nyou might view a lot of bright lights.\nBut most nights of your life,\nyou're going to want to dim the lights\nin your internal environment.\nAnd ideally, the lights that you do use\nyou would place low in\nthat physical environment.\nSo you would try and\nnot use overhead lights,\nbut rather rely on desk lamps or lights\neven placed low to the\nfloor, even on the floor.\nIf you are going to use light at night,\nand most people do,\nI would encourage you to use\nas little artificial light\nas is required to carry\nout the activities you need\nto require safely.\nThat could be studying,\nin which case you might\nneed a little bit more light\nin order to read or study.\nIf you're watching a television show\nor you're watching\nsomething on your computer,\ndim that screen way, way down,\nas dim as possible while\nstill, of course, being able\nto view what you need to view.\nEven better, I should say, ideally,\nyou would use candlelight\nand/or moonlight.\nNow, some nights the moon is really bright\nand you actually can use moonlight\nto go about your usual activities.\nMoonlight might seem very, very bright,\nbut, actually, moonlight is\nfairly low light intensity,\nand candlelight, which\ncan also seem very bright,\nactually is very low light intensity.\nIf you're sitting across a table\nwith some candlelight there\nand it's a really bright candle,\nchances are it's only\nabout three to 10 lux,\nwhich is very, very little light energy\ncompared to, say, an artificial desk lamp\nor an overhead light,\nwhich is going to be in the area\nof anywhere from a\nhundred to a thousand lux.\nSo candlelight is fine.\nOf course, be cautious with open flame,\nbut candlelight is fine.\nMoonlight is fine.\nDimming artificial lights is fine\nprovided they're dimmed way, way down.\nAnd again, try and avoid using\noverhead artificial lights.\nThe absolute worst lights\nare going to be overhead\nfluorescent lights\nof the sort that you would\nhave in the supermarket\nor that you would see at a gas station\nor something of that sort.\nAnd I confess, there are times\nin which I'm driving home\nand it's late at night and I\nwant to be able to get to sleep\nand I'll need to stop at the grocery store\nor a gas station or something like that,\nI've actually put on sunglasses at night\nin order to avoid getting\nthat bright light exposure at night.\nAlthough that's a little bit extreme,\nI have done that from time to time\nbecause that bright light exposure\nwill absolutely quash, it will eliminate,\nany melatonin that\nhappens to be circulating\nin your brain and body.\nNow, melatonin, a lot of people\nthink of it as a supplement,\nbut melatonin is naturally released\nas the evening comes about\nand into the nighttime hours.\nIt's the hormone that\nmakes you feel sleepy\nand allows you to fall asleep.\nSo viewing bright light\nin the late evening\nhours and nighttime hours\nis really not good for your sleep quality\nand your ability to fall and stay asleep.\nSo for most people, a simple rule of thumb\nis going to be avoid bright\nartificial lights of all colors,\nand in particular, overhead\nbright artificial lights,\nbetween the hours of\n10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.\nThat's right, between\n10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.,\navoid those bright artificial\nlights as much as possible.\nUse only as much light as\nis absolutely necessary\nin order to carry out the\nroutines and activities\nyou need to carry out safely.\nI should mention\nthat the reason overhead\nlights are problematic\nis the same reason why\nsunlight is so great\nearly in the day,\nwhich is that the cells,\nthat is, the neurons,\nthat can wake up your brain and body\nthrough activation of the circadian clock\nreside mainly in the bottom half or 2/3\nof your neural retina\nand the way the optics of your eyes work\nis that the cells on the\nbottom half of your eye\nview the upper visual field.\nSo this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism\nthat allows these cells\nto respond to overhead light from sunlight\nin the early part of the\nday and throughout the day.\nBut in the evening, if you have\nbright artificial lights on\nand those bright artificial\nlights are overhead lights,\nit's going to more closely mimic\nwhat sunlight does in the evening time,\nand that turns out to be a bad thing\nif your goal is to eventually go to sleep.\nSo again, do like the Scandinavians do.\nUse lights that are set\nlow in the room at night,\nand if you really want to\noptimize your sleep-wake cycles,\nI suppose you could also do the\nopposite throughout the day.\nYou could really emphasize the use\nof bright artificial lights and sunlight\nthat comes from above.\nAnd of course, sunlight\nalways comes from above.\nBut if you're working in\na given office environment\nand, you know, it's 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nand you want to be as awake as possible,\nreally crank up the overhead lights.\nAnd then in the evening,\nwhich is this critical period\nthree that we're referring to,\nreally try and dim those\nlights or have them off\nor just rely on candlelight or moonlight\nfrom the hours of about\n10:00 p.m. until 4:00 a.m.\nOur good friend Samer Hattar,\nwho's been on this podcast before,\nSamer is director of\nthe chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health,\nwell, he's absolutely obsessive\nabout this light stuff\nand avoiding light at night.\nIn fact, he lives in what I sort of joke\nis like a cave at night.\nFrom 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m.,\nwhich is really his kind of sleep cycle,\nhe has his house so dark\nthat you'd be lucky to be able\nto find a spoon in the kitchen.\nIn fact, you'd be lucky\nto find your way down\nthe hallway if you're me.\nBut in any case, dim the lights.\nTurn them way, way down.\nIt will serve you well.\nIt will make it much easier for you\nto get sleepy and stay\nsleepy and fall asleep\nand stay asleep throughout the night.\nNow, not to depart from\nthis critical period three,\nbut if you recall, viewing\nthat afternoon light,\nthe low solar angle light\nas the sun is heading down in the sky,\nso it could be sunset\nor what I call circa\nsunset, around sunset,\nwell, doing that is going to slightly,\nbut not completely, offset\nany of the negative effects\nof viewing artificial light at night.\nSo I don't want to give\npeople a pass here,\nbut let's say you know\nthat you're going to watch\nsome Netflix at night\nor you're going to be up late studying\nand yet you still want to be\nable to fall and stay asleep.\nDefinitely make sure you\nsee that evening light.\nThere's a great study.\nWe'll provide a link to this study,\nwhich showed that if people\nview evening sunset light\nor evening sunsets\nor sunlight right around\nthe time of sunset,\nit really serves to\ninoculate or offset some,\nagain, some, not all,\nof the negative effects\nof artificial light\nbetween the hours of\n10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.\nNow, that's light.\nBut as you recall,\nwe also have this tool\nrelated to temperature,\nand you're probably not\ngoing to be surprised\nthat the way to leverage\ntemperature in the evening\nis the exact opposite\nof the way that you want\nto leverage temperature\nearly in the day.\nEarly in the day, temperature increases\nfrom cold showers or exercise,\net cetera, wake you up.\nWhat that means is that taking\na cold shower late at night\nis probably a bad idea.\nRather, taking a nice hot bath or a sauna,\nyou might think would heat up your body,\nand indeed, that's what happens\nif you stay in a very long time,\nbut if you do hot tub or a hot bath\nor a sauna in the evening,\nand you don't stay in for\nmore than 20 or 30 minutes\nand you get out,\nyou take maybe a cool-ish\nshower or a warm shower,\nthen what happens is there's\na compensatory cooling off\nof your core body temperature\nfor the reasons we discussed earlier,\nand your body temperature will\ndrop by one to three degrees\nand it will make it much\neasier to get into sleep.\nSo if you're somebody\nthat enjoys hot baths,\nhot showers, or hot tubs,\nevening and nighttime\nis going to be the best time to do that\nif your goal is to facilitate sleep.\nSimilarly, you should try\nand make your sleeping environment\npretty cool, if not cold.\nNow, that doesn't mean you need to be cold\nwhile you're asleep.\nYou can get under as many\nblankets as you need,\nbut it's a good idea to make\nyour sleeping environment cool.\nIn fact, drop the temperature\nin that sleeping environment\nby at least three degrees\nand you'll be happy that you did.\nNow, some people rely on\nthings like Eight Sleep.\nI use that.\nOne of these controllable\ntemperature mattress covers.\nOther people would simply do this\nby putting a fan in the\nroom or opening a window.\nAgain, depends on time of year,\ndepends on technology,\ndepends on budgets, et cetera.\nBut you're going to want to sleep\nin a relatively cool or\ncold sleeping environment\nand then layer on the blankets\nas needed to stay asleep.\nAnd I say as needed\nbecause one of the things\nthat you're going to do in your sleep,\nor if you happen to wake up,\nis if you're too warm, you're\ngoing to put a foot or a hand\nout from under those blankets.\nAnd the reason for doing\nthat is very logical\nonce you understand the mechanism.\nYou have special portals,\nyou essentially have ways of passing heat,\nexcuse me, in and out of your body\nprimarily through the palms of your hands,\nthe upper half of your face,\nand the bottoms of your feet\nthrough so-called glabrous skin.\nThis was covered in the\nepisode with Dr. Craig Heller\nfrom the biology department at Stanford.\nIf you lower the temperature\nin your sleeping environment,\nso lower the temperature in that room\nor use a controllable mattress\ncover that can cool down\nlike Eight Sleep or\nsomething of that sort,\nit's naturally going to make\nyour sleep environment cooler,\nand if you're too warm under the blankets,\nall you have to do is\nextend a hand or a foot\nout from under those blankets.\nWhereas if the sleeping\nenvironment that you're in\nis too warm,\nthere's very little you can do to cool off\nbesides push off those blankets.\nSo for instance, if you're too warm\nand you're waking up in\nthe middle of the night,\nwhich is what happens if you get too warm,\nyou'll push off those blankets.\nBut if the room is too warm,\nwell, what are you going to do?\nYou'd probably have to put\nyour hands into some cool water\nor take a coolish shower or something\nfor a couple of seconds.\nThat's not very practical.\nBetter to just keep the\nsleeping environment cool.\nI'm not a big fan of\npeople putting socks on\nwhile they sleep,\nor I should say, I'm not\na fan of putting socks on\nwhile I sleep,\nbecause that eliminates\nthis glabrous skin portal\non the bottoms of one's feet.\nSo for those of you that have heard,\nyou know, wear socks while you sleep,\nthat works great for people\nthat tend to run too cold while they sleep\nand wake up because their feet get cold,\nbut if you're somebody who wakes up\nin the middle of the night,\nchances are you're waking up\nbecause you're getting too warm\nand the best thing that you could do\nis to cool or lower the temperature\nin the room that you're sleeping\nand not wear socks,\nget under as many blankets\nas you need to fall asleep,\nand then across the night,\nyou'll naturally just\nmove a hand or a foot\nor all hands and feet out\nfrom under those blankets\nto cool off\nbecause of the relationship\nbetween temperature and sleep.\nThat is, dropping your\ncore body temperature\none to three degrees\ngets you into sleep and\nhelps you stay asleep.\nSo let's say you do\nexercise late in the day\nand you're finding yourself\nvery alert in the evening\nand you need to fall asleep,\nor let's say you've exercised\nand you needed four cups of espresso\nin order to do that exercise.\nWell, there are a few\nthings that you can do\nto try and bring your nervous system down\ninto more state of calmness,\nand you can do that\nalso by lowering your\ncore body temperature.\nOne of those I already\ntalked about before,\ntaking a nice hot shower or a hot bath\nand then getting out and cooling off\nwill decrease your body temperature.\nMaybe not enough to get you into sleep\nif you have a ton of\ncaffeine in your system.\nBut again, you can use this\nmechanism of temperature shifts\nto wake up\nor temperature shifts to fall asleep\nin ways that really can help you overcome\nsome of the irregularities\nin your sleep-wake cycle\nand exercise cycle, et cetera.\nBecause, of course, nobody's perfect.\nSome days we end up having\nto workout in the afternoon\nor we'll miss the workout entirely.\nOther days, we end up\nhaving that cup of coffee\nin the afternoon with a friend\nand then we have a hard\ntime falling asleep.\nSo you can use these tools\nnot just in their optimized form,\nyou know, being absolutely\nobsessive and compulsive\nabout exactly when you\ndo each of those tools.\nThat would be wonderful,\nbut life happens as they say\nand some days you're going\nto feel too alert at night\nand you want to fall asleep,\nor you've got to get up\nespecially early the next morning\nand you're not somebody\nwho normally goes to bed at 10:00 p.m.\nWell, that's when a something\nlike a hot bath or a sauna\ncan really benefit you\nbecause it can adjust your\ntemperature rhythm accordingly.\nI would be remiss if I\ndidn't touch on alcohol\nand CBD and THC.\nI always get questions about these.\nAnd I should say, of course,\nmany places, but not all, THC is illegal.\nAlthough, there are medical uses\nand in some places, it's decriminalized,\nother places it's legal.\nAlcohol, of course, is consumed\nalmost as frequently as\ncaffeine is consumed.\nI personally don't drink alcohol.\nI don't have anything against it per se.\nI just don't tend to enjoy it.\nOne of the reasons I don't enjoy it\nis if I drink alcohol,\nI simply fall asleep.\nSo that doesn't really accomplish\nany of the things that I\nreally want to accomplish\nbecause the sleep that one\ngets after drinking alcohol\nis greatly disrupted sleep.\nHate to break it to you,\nbut that's the truth.\nAnd when Dr. Matt Walker\ncame on this podcast,\nhe said exactly the same thing.\nWhile THC and alcohol do\nhelp some people fall asleep\nand maybe even stay asleep,\nthe architecture of\nthat sleep is suboptimal\ncompared to the sleep they would get\nwithout alcohol or THC in their system.\nSo I'm not here to tell you\nwhat to do or not to do.\nI'm certainly not the substance police.\nThat's not my role.\nI'm just reporting to you the biology.\nIf your sleep is not restoring you\nto the extent that you feel it should,\nor if you are regularly\nrelying on a drink or two\nin order to fall asleep,\nor THC in order to fall asleep,\nthat is disrupting your\ntotal pattern of sleep.\nHowever, I do realize\nthat nowadays a lot of people\nare relying on THC and/or CBD,\nespecially edible forms,\nin order to fall and stay asleep.\nAnd, you know, we can\njust acknowledge the data.\nIt does seem that there's\nan anxiety lowering effect\nof some of those compounds\nthat do help people\nwho have a hard time\nfalling and staying asleep\nbecause of reasons related to anxiety.\nAlthough, in a moment,\nwe'll talk about some supplements\nand supplement protocols\nthat can also assist in the\nability to fall and stay asleep\nand that can adjust anxiety\nand that do not seem to\ndisrupt sleep architecture\nin negative ways\nand, in fact, can enhance\nthe depth and quality\nof sleep architecture.\nOkay, so you've done everything\ncorrectly up until now.\nYou got your morning routine\nfrom critical period one.\nYou've got your afternoon routine.\nYou saw some sunlight in the afternoon.\nYou avoided caffeine in the eight hours\nor 10 hours before bedtime.\nYou're not drinking alcohol.\nYou've cooled down the room.\nYou're doing all these things right.\nYou've dimmed the lights,\net cetera, et cetera.\nWhat else can we do in\norder to optimize our sleep?\nWell, I always say behavioral tools first,\nthen look to nutrition,\nthen, if necessary,\nlook to supplementation,\nand then, if still necessary,\nlook to prescription drugs\nobviously prescribed by a\nboard certified physician.\nWell, we've talked a lot\nabout the behavioral tools\nfor critical period three.\nWe have not talked a lot\nabout the supplementation-based tools.\nThere are supplements that for most people\nwill greatly improve their\nability to fall and stay asleep\nand the three main\nsupplements in that category\nor that kit of sleep supplements,\nand I've talked about these before,\nare magnesium threonate,\nso T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,\napigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,\nand theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine.\nNow, some important things to point out\nabout mag threonate, as it's\ncalled, apigenin, and theanine.\nFirst of all,\nyou don't necessarily\nneed to take all three,\nalthough, many people\nget a synergistic effect\nfrom taking all three.\nIn fact, you may not even\nneed to take even one.\nWhat I recommend is that\nif you're already doing\nall the behavioral tools regularly\nand you're still having\ntrouble falling asleep\nand staying asleep,\nwell, then you might try\none of the supplements\nwithin this sleep stack.\nThey do have fairly\nwide margins for safety.\nAlthough, I should also say,\nanytime you're going to\nadd or remove something\nfrom your supplement protocol\nor your nutritional program,\nyou definitely want to\ntalk to your physician.\nI don't just say that to protect us.\nI say that to protect you.\nBut for most people, the margins\nof safety on these things\nare going to be pretty broad.\nA couple of notes about dosages.\nFor some people, the dosages\nof any one or several\nof the supplements I\nmentioned will be zero.\nThat is, you won't need them\nin order to get and stay asleep\nmost nights of your life.\nThat's terrific if you don't need them.\nFor many people, however,\ntaking 145 milligrams\nof magnesium threonate\ncan be very beneficial.\nThat's the dosage that most\npeople will benefit from.\nSome people need to go a little higher.\nSome people need to go a little bit lower.\nOne of the reasons that\nwe've been pointing people\ntowards single-ingredient\nformulations these days\nis because it allows people\nto adjust the dosage of one component\nof a so-called sleep stack\nwithout having to disrupt the\ndosage of another component,\nand so on.\nIt also allows people to try\njust one element within the sleep stack\nwithout having to purchase\nand try the others,\nwhich is a problem if\nyou're buying a blend\nof a lot of different ingredients.\nSo 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate.\n50, 5-0, milligrams of apigenin.\nAnd again, you could just\ntake the apigenin on its own.\nAnd 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine\ntaken, again, alone or in combination\nwith the other supplements\nmentioned in the stack\nmany people find allows\nthem to get really drowsy\nand fall asleep, sleep really deeply,\nand they feel much more\nrefreshed the next day\nand they don't have a grogginess to them.\nNow, a couple of notes about\nthese different supplements.\nAbout 5% of people report\nthat magnesium threonate\nreally disrupts their gut.\nIt gives them diarrhea\nor gastric distress.\nIn which case, don't take it.\nIf magnesium threonate disrupts\nyour gut or your digestion\nto a point where it's\nuncomfortable or at all\nand you don't like it,\ndon't take any of it.\nThe proper dosage for you, in other words,\nwould be zero milligrams.\nNow, in a slightly different way,\nmany people who can\ntolerate magnesium threonate\nor really thrive on magnesium threonate\nand like apigenin\nmight find that theanine,\neven at the lowest dose\nof a hundred milligrams,\n'cause, again, the range is\na hundred to 400 milligrams,\nthat theanine gives them such vivid dreams\nthat they actually find it disruptive\nwhere they wake up in\nthe middle of the night\nor they find that the\nsleep that they're getting\nis kind of anxiety ridden\nbecause of the intensity of those dreams.\nSo some people might\nchoose to leave theanine\nout of the sleep stack\nand just take magnesium\nthreonate or apigenin\nAnd again, some people might\nleave magnesium threonate\nout of the sleep stack.\nAgain, all of this is really about finding\nthe supplementation protocol\nthat's ideal for you.\nI should mention that whether or not\nyou're taking one or two\nor three of the components\nof the sleep stack,\nthe ideal time to take those\nis 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,\nespecially if you haven't\nhad anything to eat\nfor the three hours or so before bedtime.\nI confess that oftentimes\nI'll have a little bit of a\nsnack late in the evening,\nsome berries or something.\nI try not to eat too close to bedtime,\nbut some evenings just\nbecause of work schedule,\nI'll get home late, be 9:00 p.m.,\nand I'll eat a big meal\nand then I'll take the\nsleep stack and fall asleep.\nEvery once in a while,\nthat just so happens.\nNobody's perfect. Certainly I'm not.\nBut that sleep stack\ncan be very beneficial.\nAnd I do think that it's\npreferable to melatonin.\nHere's the reason.\nFirst of all, melatonin is a hormone\nthat you endogenously make.\nYou now know a lot about melatonin\nand it's controlled by light,\nmeaning light inhibits\nit or eliminates it,\ndarkness promotes it.\nAnd melatonin indeed\ncan help us fall asleep,\nbut the dosages of melatonin\nthat are contained in\nmost commercial products\nis far, far, far greater\nthan what we would make endogenously.\nSo it's really supraphysiological.\nSo that's of concern\nbecause melatonin is not just responsible\nfor making us sleepy and fall asleep.\nIt also does things\nlike interacts with other hormone systems,\ntestosterone and estrogen,\neven in the puberty system, in kids.\nIs taking melatonin every\nonce in a while a problem\nfor adjusting to jet lag, et cetera?\nProbably not. I would even say no.\nBut taking it chronically over time,\nespecially kids taking\nit chronically over time,\ncan potentially be problematic.\nSo at least in my opinion,\nthese other supplements\nare going to be preferable to melatonin.\nNow, as I mentioned in the\nbeginning of today's episode,\nthere are some other things\nthat I certainly take\nevery once in a while\nand that other people\nmight consider taking\nin addition to the sleep\nstack I talked about before\nor in place of that sleep stack\nif that sleep stack\ndoesn't work well for them.\nSo every third or fourth night,\nI will take two grams of glycine\nand a hundred milligrams of GABA\nin addition to the standard sleep stack\nthat I talked about before.\nSo I'm taking mag threonate,\napigenin, and theanine,\nand then I will also take two\ngrams of glycine and GABA,\nwhich I find greatly enhances\nmy ability to get into sleep.\nBut the reason I only add glycine and GABA\nevery third or fourth night\nis that if I take it too often,\nI find that the entire sleep stack\ndoesn't work quite as effectively.\nI don't know exactly why this is the case,\nbut in any event, that's what I do.\nAnd more recently, I've\nalso started using inositol,\nin particular myo-inositol.\nEvery other night, I'll take\n900 milligrams of myo-inositol\nin addition to mag threonate,\napigenin, and theanine,\nand not on the nights when\nI take glycine and GABA.\nSo I'm adding 900 milligrams of inositol\nto the standard sleep stack\nof mag threonate, theanine, and apigenin.\nAnd what I find is not only\ndoes it greatly enhance\nmy ability to fall asleep quickly,\nbut if I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night,\nwhich I often do to use the bathroom,\nI find it very, very\neasy to fall back asleep.\nWhereas when I don't take\ninositol every other night or so,\nI find that if I wake up\nin the middle of the night,\nit's a bit more of a\nchallenge to fall back asleep.\nSo inositol has a number of different uses\nthat have been discussed\nin terms of mental health\nand in terms of adjusting\nanxiety for its daytime use.\nWhat I'm talking about\nis taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol\nalso 30 to 60 minutes before sleep\nalong with the standard sleep stack\nand I found that to be\nimmensely beneficial.\nI also noticed that it\nhas a pretty long tail\nof anxiety suppression throughout the day.\nAnd I'm not somebody who\nsuffers from anxiety,\nbut I have to say it just has led me\nto feel a bit calmer throughout the day,\nand I don't really know how to say this\nexcept in subjective terms,\nto feel a bit more buffered against\nor resilient against stress events.\nAnd if you look at the\nliterature on inositol\nand its interactions\nwith the serotonin\nsystem and other systems,\nthat all makes sense as to\nwhy that would be the case.\nSo we'll provide links to\nour so-called sleep kit,\nwhich is part of our\nNeural Network Newsletter.\nIt's a zero-cost newsletter\nwhere you can access this\ninformation about supplements\nand other behavioral tools\nfor sleep in list form.\nBut that sleep kit doesn't include\nsome of the newer information\nthat I've provided this episode,\nin particular, the\ninformation about inositol\nand what I'm finding\nto be the very beneficial use of inositol\nfor the ability to fall back asleep\nafter waking up in the\nmiddle of the night,\nwhich is something that a\nlot of people struggle with.\nNow, that's supplementation\nfor falling and staying asleep,\nbut we can return to the behavioral tools\nalso as powerful levers and tools\nfor falling asleep and\ngetting back to sleep.\nAnd again, we look to\nNSDR, non-sleep deep rest,\nor the Reveri app as a way to do that.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nthe Reveri app has been\ndeveloped on the basis\nof really high-quality,\npeer-reviewed research,\nboth clinical and non-clinical,\nby my colleague, David Spiegel,\nwho's our associate chair\nof psychiatry at Stanford.\nIt's a wonderful tool.\nIt does carry a cost after\nthe initial seven-day trial.\nI can tell you what the cost on that is\nso you can get a sense\nbecause I do realize that\nanything that carries a cost,\nfor some people, it won't be accessible.\nRight now, Reveri,\nand I should just mention,\nthey didn't pay us for an ad read.\nI'm just telling you what they told me\nso that I can accurately report\nwhat it costs to use Reveri.\nThey have a monthly subscription\nto use the Reveri app at 14.99.\nYou do get the seven-day free trial.\nThey have a yearly subscription of 99.99\nwith a seven-day free trial.\nAnd they have a lifetime\npurchase, one-time purchase,\nof 249 with no trial.\nIt right now is only available\nfor Apple, not for Android,\nbut they are, yes, going\nto have it available\nfor Android soon.\nThere's a signup list there.\nI should mention that while\nthe cost might seem high,\nif you compare that cost\nto, say, supplements,\nor you compare that cost to a\npoor night's sleep over time,\nthe cost, at least to me,\nseems somewhat modest,\ncertainly within range\nfor a number of people.\nBut I acknowledge not within\nrange for other people,\nwhich is why I also want\nto point to zero-cost tools\nand the zero-cost tool for\ngetting asleep, staying asleep,\nand falling back asleep\nis going to be NSDR.\nWe'll put a link to a\nnon-sleep deep rest protocol\nthat's available on YouTube,\nso available to anybody zero cost\nprovided you have a internet connection.\nAgain, dim the screen\nif you're going to turn\nthat on late at night.\nAnd there are a number of\nother yoga nidra scripts\nand apps and sources around the internet,\nin particular, on YouTube,\nthat are zero cost that you could use\nif the Reveri app is\noutside your price range\nor is not preferable to you, et cetera.\nWhen I wake up in the middle of the night,\nit's usually to use the restroom.\nI'll go use the restroom.\nI'll keep the lights as dim as possible.\nI'll get back into bed.\nAnd if I find that it's\neasy to fall asleep,\ngreat, I'm asleep.\nAnd if not, then I will\ngenerally plug in the Reveri app.\nThey have a fall back asleep hypnosis,\nand 99 times out of a hundred,\nI'm back asleep within minutes\nand I don't wake up until morning.\nNow, very briefly, I just\nwant to touch on some tools\nthat are very commonly used\nby many people out there,\nand believe it or not,\nthere is peer-reviewed science\non things like eye masks.\nDo eye masks improve your\nability to stay asleep?\nAnd indeed, they do,\nprovided they are not too tight\nand provided that the room is cool enough.\nWhy?\nWell, eye masks cover the\nupper half of your face,\nwhich is where glabrous skin is localized.\nRemember, palms of the\nhands, bottoms of the feet,\nglabrous skin on the face.\nSo a lot of people who\nwear eye masks will wake up\nbecause they're too warm\nif the room is too warm.\nSo if you're going to use an\neye mask to keep light out,\ndefinitely make sure the room\nand your sleeping environment\nand your bed are cool enough\nin order for you to stay asleep.\nIn addition, I get a lot of\nquestions about earplugs.\nHere's the deal with earplugs.\nSome people find that\nearplugs are very beneficial\nbecause, of course, they\nprevent the entrance of sound\ninto the ear that could wake us up.\nBut some people find that the sound\nof their own beating of their\nown heart can be disruptive\nand they get a sort of\nhumming in their head\nwhen they have those earplugs in.\nI'm one such person.\nAlthough, I have family members\nthat like using earplugs when they sleep.\nSo it's really up to you.\nYou have to see whether\nor not those earplugs help\nor disrupt your sleep.\nFor me, they're no good.\nFor some people, they really enjoy them.\nI don't use an eye mask\nunless I'm sleeping in a\nreally bright environment\nor I need to sleep on a plane\nand things of that sort.\nOther tools that I'll just mention\nthat have peer-reviewed\nresearch to support them.\nElevating your feet either with a pillow\nor by elevating the end of your bed\nby about three to five degrees\ncan be really beneficial for\nincreasing the depth of sleep\nbecause of the so-called\nglymphatic washout.\nThis is the movement of\nand circulation of fluids\nin your brain at night\nthat lead to more wakefulness\nand actually can improve\ncognitive function\nand a number of other things\nrelated to brain health.\nThere's one caveat to that.\nFor people that suffer from acid reflux,\nhaving your ankles\nelevated above your chest\nor above your heart in\nthe middle of the night\ncan actually exacerbate that acid reflux.\nYou want to do the opposite.\nYou want to actually elevate\nthe head side of your bed\nby about three to five degrees.\nNow, one of the common\ncauses of sleep disruption\nthat has tremendously detrimental effects\nis so-called sleep apnea.\nSo this is basically bouts of suffocation\nor lack of oxygenation during sleep.\nThis is particularly the case\nfor people that are very heavyset,\nand that heavyset could be from obesity,\nit could also be heavyset\nfrom having too much muscle.\nA lot of people who are\ncarrying too much muscle\nwill actually have sleep\napnea without realizing it.\nSleep apnea is actually very dangerous.\nIt's associated with a number\nof cardiovascular issues.\nIt's associated with sexual dysfunction.\nIt's associated with\nissues with cognition.\nSleep apnea is bad.\nA lot of people will have to use the PAP,\nwhich is a, it's a device.\nIt looks like a sort of like\na snorkel mask or a dive mask.\nIt's a whole apparatus that\npeople will go to sleep with.\nHowever, many people can relieve\nthemselves of sleep apnea\nprovided it's not too serious\nand can sleep much better,\nin fact, I think all people\ncan sleep much better,\nif they train themselves\nto be nose breathers while they sleep.\nThere are a lot of reasons\nto be a nose breather\nunless you are breathing\nvery hard due to exercise\nor talking or eating.\nThat was all covered\nin James Nestor's book,\n\"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.\"\nIt's been covered in a\nnumber of different podcasts.\nWe've talked about it\non this podcast as well.\nIt's a good idea to be a nose breather\nunless you need to mouth breathe.\nAnd it's a great idea, it's a superb idea,\nto be a nose breather in sleep.\nAnd one way to really get good at that\nis to take a little bit of medical tape\nand to tape your mouth\nshut before going to sleep.\nYou heard me right.\nPut some medical tape over your mouth\nand force yourself to\nnose breathe during sleep.\nIt also prevents snoring in most cases.\nReally offsets sleep apnea.\nSleep apnea, again, being a\nvery serious health concern.\nI should also mention as a tool\nthat if you have a hard time\nbeing a nose breather in sleep,\nyou can try doing your\ncardiovascular exercise,\nat least the lower-intensity\ncardiovascular exercise,\nthrough purely nasal breathing.\nAnd one way to do that, again,\nis to tape your mouth shut\nor put a gulp of water in your mouth,\nbut don't actually swallow\nthat mouth full of water,\nor to use a mouthpiece\nor just deliberately\nkeep your mouth closed\nand insist on breathing through your nose.\nMost people find\nthat when they start doing\ncardiovascular exercise that way,\nit's really challenging at first,\nbut over time, they\nactually can feel quite calm\nand still can generate\na lot of physical effort\npurely using nose breathing.\nThe reason that doing nose breathing\nduring cardiovascular exercise\ntranslates to being a\nnose breather during sleep\nis that your sinuses actually\ncan dilate, they're plastic,\nand over time,\nplastic meaning they're malleable that is,\nand they can become wider.\nYou're not going to get giant\nnostrils. Don't worry about it.\nYour airways within your skull,\n'cause that's what the sinuses really are,\nthese little passages within the skull,\nand, of course, within the nasal passages,\nwill dilate and will allow you\nto breathe more easily through your nose.\nBut for those of you\nthat are waking up in\nthe middle of the night\nbreathing on your back [breathing heavily]\nor your partner is telling you that\nor other people are telling you that\nor you're that person on the plane\nwith your mouth hanging open and drooling\nand your mouth breathing,\nterrible, terrible,\nterrible for health reasons\nand other reasons,\nput some a medical tape over your mouth,\nlearn to be a nose breather during sleep.\nYour sleep will improve\nand your daytime feelings\nof wakefulness and focus will improve,\nyour cardiovascular health will improve,\nand on and on and on.\nSo now we've largely covered\nthe tools that one could use\nto get and stay asleep,\nand we talked about exercise,\nwe talked about temperature,\nwe talked about supplements,\nand we talked about, of course,\nkeeping the sleeping environment\nboth cool and as dark as possible.\nI do want to mention a\ncouple of broad contour tools\nthat will impact your ability\nto sleep really well on a consistent basis\nand the one that impacts\nthe most number of people\nis weekends.\nTurns out that most\neverybody feels the impulse\nto sleep in on the weekend,\nespecially if they've been\nout late the night before.\nHowever, the data show\nthat keeping relatively\nconsistent sleep and wake times\nis really going to enhance\nthe quality and depth of your sleep.\nSo if you stay out late one night,\nsure, you might allow yourself\nto sleep in an extra hour or so,\nbut you should really try\nto avoid sleeping in longer\nthan an hour beyond your\nnormal wake-up time.\nThat's right.\nIf you normally get eight hours of sleep\nand you wake up at 7:00 a.m.,\nprobably okay to wake up\nat 8:00 a.m. on the weekend\nor after a night out the night before,\nbut try not to sleep until 11 or noon\nthinking that you're going\nto catch up on your sleep\nor that's better than waking\nup at a consistent time.\nIt would be better to wake\nup at a consistent time\nplus or minus an hour\nand get a nap in the afternoon\nprovided that nap, again, isn't too long.\nAnd the other tool\nthat relates to nights that\nyou stayed out too late\nor that you feel like you\nwant to sleep in a bit more\nin the morning\nis if you are going to wake\nup at your consistent time.\nSo for example, normally\nyou go to bed at 10\nand you wake up at six.\nLet's say that's your schedule.\nAnd you end up staying up late one night\nuntil midnight or one for whatever reason\nand the next morning you wake up at seven\nand you're still groggy.\nIn that case, you absolutely want to wait\nto ingest caffeine 90 to\n120 minutes after waking.\nYou really do because there are good data\nto support the fact that\ncaffeine can disrupt sleep.\nYes, that's obvious.\nCaffeine especially disrupts sleep\nif you take it too late in the day.\nThat's very obvious as to\nwhy that would be the case.\nBut caffeine especially disrupts\nwhat's called compensatory sleep.\nSo if you start changing your waking time\nand your to sleep time\nand you start using additional caffeine\nto offset the sleepiness\nthat you're experiencing\nbecause of those late nights out,\nwell, that's when you\nreally start to disrupt\nnot just your nighttime sleep,\nbut your daytime compensatory\nsleep, so those naps.\nYou also are disrupting the\ntotal architecture of sleep\nin the early morning hours.\nThere's a lot of great science\nthat's been put to this,\nor that's emerged from this, I should say.\nSo try and keep those sleep-wake\ntimes relatively constant\nplus or minus an hour,\nand try as much as you can\nto delay that caffeine intake\n90 to 120 minutes after waking every day,\nbut especially on days where you wake up\nand you feel you haven't\ngotten enough sleep.\nIn that case, I highly recommend\nyou just use NSDR or the Reveri app\nor some other form of deep relaxation\nto try and compensate\nfor the lack of sleep,\nknowing, of course, that\nthere's no complete compensation\nfor lack of sleep.\nThere are just things that we can do\nto partially offset lack of sleep.\nNow, a couple of final\npoints and additional tools\nthat I think are going to\nbe useful to everybody,\nin particular, people\nwho have young children\nor are following a shift work schedule\nor who are experiencing jet lag.\nKeep in mind, jet lag\ncan be due to travel,\nwhich is obvious,\nbut jet lag can also be due\nto getting woken up in the\nmiddle of the night, right?\nYour body doesn't know the difference\nbetween flying to a new time zone\nand getting woken up in\nthe middle of the night.\nThe tool that I'd like to offer you\nis an understanding of something\ncalled temperature minimum.\nAnd I'm going to make\nthis as simple as possible\nand I'm confident that\neveryone can understand this\neven if you don't have\nany science background.\nHere's the question you\nneed to ask yourself.\nWhat is your typical wake-up time, okay?\nWhat's your typical wake-up time?\nIf for you, your typical\nwake-up time is 7:00 a.m.\nplus or minus half an hour,\nand that could be 7:00 a.m.\nbecause you set an alarm clock\nor it could be 7:00 a.m.\nbecause you naturally wake up\nat 7:00 a.m., doesn't matter,\nif your typical wake-up\ntime most days is 7:00 a.m.,\nwell, then your temperature\nminimum is 5:00 a.m.\nThat's right, your temperature\nminimum is not a temperature.\nIt's a time within your 24-hour cycle.\nApproximately two hours before\nyour typical wake-up time,\nyour body is at its lowest temperature\nthat it will ever be in the 24-hour cycle.\nThat's why it's called\nyour temperature minimum.\nHere's what you need to know\nabout your temperature minimum.\nIf you view bright light,\nexercise, or drink caffeine\nor all of the above\nin the two to four hours before\nyour temperature minimum,\nthat will delay your clock.\nWhat that means when\nI say delay your clock\nis it will make you want\nto go to sleep later\nand wake up later the next night, okay?\nSo let's run this exercise for you,\nthe person waking up at 7:00\na.m. on a regular basis,\nI can predict with almost certainty\nthat your body is going to\nbe at its lowest temperature\nat 5:00 a.m..\nSo what that means\nis that if you get up at\n3:00 a.m. or at 4:00 a.m.\nand you flip on bright\nlights in your house\nor in your bathroom\nor you have a cup of coffee\nor you do any kind of exercise\nor you get up and head to the airport,\nthe mechanisms in your brain and body\nthat control timing of sleep\nand timing of waking will shift.\nThey will delay.\nIt's as if you put your clock\non hold for a little while\nand then let it start again, okay?\nThat's the simplest way I can describe it.\nAnd you will tend to\nwant to go to sleep later\nand wake up later the following night.\nNow, the opposite is true\nif you view bright light, drink caffeine,\nor exercise or socialize, I should say,\nin the hours immediately after\nyour temperature minimum.\nSo for you in this example,\nthe person who's waking up at 7:00 a.m.,\nyour temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m.,\nif you view bright light, exercise,\nmaybe have a snack, maybe\nnot, or socialize, move about,\nat 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.\nThat will tend to phase\nadvance your clock.\nIt will tend to basically make you\nwant to go to bed earlier\nand wake up earlier\nthe following night.\nNow, I used this example\nof a person who wakes up\ntypically at 7:00 a.m.\nwhose temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m.,\nbut, of course, you need\nto adjust that for yourself\nif you're somebody who\nwakes up at 9:00 a.m.\nor at 5:00 a.m. et cetera.\nWhy do I offer this as a tool?\nWell, this is an immensely powerful tool\nif, for instance, you\nare headed to a time zone\nwhere you need to go to bed earlier\nand wake up earlier once you\narrive in that time zone.\nWhat it means is in the day\nor two before you leave,\nyou can force yourself to\nexercise, drink caffeine,\nmaybe even to eat a meal\nearly in the morning,\nor maybe you still fast\nearly in the morning\nand that's really up to you,\nbut you force yourself\nto do the activities\nthat are going to phase\nadvance your clock.\nWhereas if you're traveling to a time zone\nwhere you are going to need\nto go to sleep much later\nand you're going to need\nto wake up much later\nor even a little bit later,\nyou can do those things\nin the hours prior to\nyour temperature minimum.\nNow, for those of you\nthat work shift work,\nthis can be especially useful,\nbut I want to say a couple\nof things about shift work.\nThere are a lot of details\nabout shift work and jet lag\nin an episode that I did\nspecifically about jet lag and shift work.\nSo for the deep dive, go there,\nbut suffice to say this for now,\nif you are going to do shift work,\ntry to stay on the same shift\nfor two weeks at a time.\nIt's very detrimental to brain and body,\nit can even be horrifically challenging\nfor your brain and body\nin a number of ways,\nif you are switching on\nthe so-called swing shift,\nyou know, you're working\nthree days the night shift,\nthree days the day shift,\nthree days the night\nshift, three days the...\nTry and stay on the same\nschedule as much as possible.\nAnd I should say for everybody,\npeople who are jet lagged and\nengaged in shift work or not,\nbut just for everybody,\nif you need to be awake in\nthe middle of your sleep cycle\nand it's not just a quick\ndeparture to the bathroom\nand back to bed,\nbut you really need to be awake,\nyou know, you're feeding a baby\nor you're taking care of a loved one\nor you need to do\nsomething that's critical\nor you need to work,\nif possible, use red light, okay?\nNow, for shift workers\nwho really are trying\nto stay awake all night and sleep all day,\nthis is not going to be ideal,\nbut for people that, for instance,\nneed to stay up really late one night\nor wake up especially\nearly, like 3:00 a.m.,\nto prepare for an exam that\nyou're just not ready for\nor to head to the airport, et cetera,\nusing red light has been shown\nto allow people to be awake enough\nand obviously see what they need to see\nin order to perform\ntheir activities safely\nbut it does not seem to\ndisrupt the cortisol rhythm\nthat is the healthy,\nnormal cortisol rhythm.\nNow, I realize this is\nkind of an advanced tool\nand many people won't have access to this.\nThere are a number of different\nsources for red lights now.\nCompanies like Joovv or KOZE light.\nThese are different brands.\nI don't have any affiliation\nto any of these brands, I should say.\nThere are a number of different\nred light bulb sources out\nthere and commercial sources\nthat you can explore if you want.\nBut understanding this temperature minimum\nis really powerful\nbecause it allows you\nto adjust your schedule\ndepending on travel,\ndepending on changing work\nschedules or school schedules.\nAnd if you're not a morning person,\nyou can use the tools related\nto temperature minimum\nto really become a\nmorning person over time,\nand it actually is pretty easy.\nAnd I talked about this\nin a previous episode\nbut I'll just mention\nthat there have been shown\nto be important, positive\neffects on cognition,\non even grip strength\nand physical performance,\nfor people that are early morning risers,\nand that's especially true for night owls\nthat deliberately shift\nthemselves to become early risers.\nOkay, so that's a lot of\ninformation and a lot of tools\nand I suppose the one set of tools\nthat I really didn't\ndrill into too deeply,\nthe ones related to\njet lag and shift work.\nAnd again, please check out the episode\non jet lag and shift work\nif that's relevant to you.\nBut I think for most people\nwho are going to sleep at night\nand are trying their best\nto sleep well at night\nand are trying their best\nto wake up in the morning at whatever hour\nand stay alert and focused\nthroughout the day,\nmaybe with a brief nap,\nthe tools that I talked about today\nrelated to light,\ntemperature, food, exercise,\ncaffeine, supplements, and digital tools,\nI'm hoping will prove to\nbe very useful for you.\nThey certainly are all supported\nby excellent peer-reviewed research.\nAnd I should just emphasize again\nthat most of the tools we talked about\nare completely zero cost.\nSo while the supplements and\nsome of the digital tools\ndo carry some cost to them,\nI really want to encourage everybody\nto get your behaviors right.\nGet all of the things related\nto your timing of exercise\nand type of exercise\nin the best possible\norder and time of day.\nWe talked about this critical\nperiod early in the day\nand then another critical\nperiod in the middle of the day\nand the late afternoon\nand then this third critical period\nin the middle of the night.\nDifferent tools for the\ndifferent three critical periods.\nI promise that if you\nstart to implement some,\nor ideally, all of these tools,\nthe quality of your sleep\nwill increase tremendously.\nAnd of course, in doing so,\nthe quality of your daytime alertness\nand your ability to focus\nwill improve tremendously.\nAgain, sleep is the absolute foundation\nof your mental health,\nyour physical health,\nand your performance in all endeavors.\nSo if there's one area of your life\nto really focus on and try and optimize,\nif your goal is to be\nhappier and more productive\nand just to have a better life overall,\nI can confidently say\nthat sleep is really\nthe thing to optimize.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero-cost\nway to support us.\nWe also now have a
