    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Emily Balcetis.\nDr. Balcetis is a professor of psychology\nat New York University,\nher laboratory studies\nmotivation, goal setting\nand tools for successful goal completion.\nI learned about Dr.\nBalcetis's work some years ago\nbecause I'm a vision scientist,\nthat is, I study the visual system,\nand I heard about this\nincredible psychologist\nat New York University\nwho was studying how vision,\nthat is, how we visualize problems\ncan predict whether or not\nwe will successfully overcome challenges\nand how we strategize in\norder to set and meet goals.\nAnd in 2020, I learned\nof Dr. Balcetis's book,\nwhich was written for the general public,\nentitled \"Clearer, Closer, Better:\nHow Successful People See the World\".\nAnd I read both the hard copy of the book\nand listened to the audiobook,\nand I absolutely loved the material.\nAs you'll learn directly\nfrom Dr. Balcetis today,\nhow people visualize a problem,\nthat is, whether or not they\nthink of a goal or a problem\nas residing at the top\nof a very steep hill,\nor on the top of a shallower hill,\nor whether or not they\nvisualize a goal or a problem\nas far off in the distance\nor closer to them in the distance,\nvisually, in their mind,\nstrongly dictates whether\nor not they will arrive\nat the challenge of meeting a goal\nor overcoming a problem with\nmore energy or less energy.\nIndeed, it dictates whether or not\nthey can push to immediate milestones,\nor whether or not they will\nthink they have to overcome\nthe entire task all at once.\nBasically, Dr. Balcetis's\nwork has discovered\nthat how we visualize a\nproblem or a goal in our mind\nhas everything to do with\nhow we lean into that goal,\nwhether or not we think of it\nas overwhelming or tractable,\nwhether or not we think that\nwe can overcome that goal\nand then it will lead\nto yet more possible rewards and goals,\nor whether or not we feel\nthat we're going to\narrive at the finish line\nand then just be overwhelmed with fatigue.\nIn other words, how you\nvisualize things in your mind,\nand when I say, \"Visualize,\"\nI mean, literally, how you visualize them\nas a visual problem or a visual goal,\nhas everything to do\nwith whether or not you will\nbe able to meet those goals\nand whether or not they will\nlead to still greater goals\nthat you will be able to achieve.\nToday's episode is an especially\nimportant one, I believe,\nbecause you're going to learn about\nquality peer-reviewed science\nfrom the expert in this field\nof goal setting, motivation and pursuit,\nand you're also going to learn\nan immense number of practical tools\nthat you can apply toward\nyour educational goals,\nyour career goals, relationship goals,\ngoals of any sort.\nBy the end of today's episode,\nyou will be better equipped\nto set and achieve your goals.\nDr. Balcetis also shares\nwith us her own experiences\nof how to set, visualize\nand achieve goals,\nand she does that within the context\nof her role as a parent,\nas somebody navigating\nrelationships of various kinds,\nand a demanding career.\nSo again, I think that you'll\nfind the information today\nto be both extremely academically grounded\nin terms of research,\nextremely practical and realistic\nin terms of how you might\napply it in your own life.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all, they ship internationally,\nbecause we know that\nmany of you are located\noutside of the United\nStates, that's valuable.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none,\nboth in terms of purity and precision\nof the amounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single-ingredient supplements,\nand that are supplied in dosages\nthat allow you to build a\nsupplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add things\nand remove things from your protocol\nin a way that's really\nsystematic and scientific.\nThis is really hard to do\nif you're taking blends\nof different supplements,\nor if the dosages are such\nthat you can't titrate,\nor that is, adjust the\ndosages of a given supplement.\nSo by using single-ingredient supplements,\nyou can really build\nout the supplement kit\nthat's ideal for you\nand your specific needs.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partner with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere, you'll see those supplements,\nand just keep in mind\nthat we are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics,\nand as some of you have\nprobably heard me say before,\nI am not a fan of the word nootropics\nbecause nootropics means smart drugs,\nand frankly, as a neuroscientist,\nthe notion of a smart drug\nis somewhat ridiculous, why?\nWell, it turns out that we have\nneural circuits in our brain\nthat get engaged for creativity,\nand yet other neural circuits\nthat are engaged for focus,\nand still other neural circuits\nthat are engaged for task switching,\nso the notion of a smart drug\nor a drug that can induce\nsmartness, if you will,\nis simply not grounded in science.\nWell, Thesis understands this\nand has developed custom nootropics\nthat are tailored to the specific\ntypes of cognitive demands\nor physical demands that\nyou might be facing.\nIf you go to Thesis's\nwebsite, you can take a quiz,\nand from that, they'll give you a sample\nof different nootropics that you can try\nso that you can create a\ncustomized kit of nootropics\nfor your specific needs.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropics starter kit,\njust go online to takethesis.com/huberman,\ntake that three-minute quiz\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month,\nthat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Levels.\nLevels is what's called a\ncontinuous glucose monitor,\nsome of you may have\nheard of these before,\nothers of you perhaps have not.\nBasically, it's a small device\nthat you wear on the back of your arm,\nit's an app that you\ninstall on your phone,\nand whether or not you are\nfasting, or you just ate,\nor you ate several hours ago,\nyou can get a realtime\nmeasurement of your blood glucose,\nwhich turns out to be\nextremely informative.\nI first started using\nthe Levels continuous glucose\nmonitor about a year ago,\nand it's taught me so much\nabout how I respond to specific foods\nin terms of blood sugar spikes,\nhow I respond to exercise,\neven the sauna, it turns out,\ncan modulate my blood glucose levels\nand your blood glucose levels\nin very interesting ways.\nSo all of that is translated\ninto a huge number of very\ndirected changes that I've made\nin terms of what I eat, when I eat,\nand how I schedule\nexercise relative to eating\nand sleep, et cetera.\nIf you're interested in trying\nthe Levels continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\nyou can simply go to levels.link/huberman,\nthat's levels.link/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA,\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality,\nand they also have some\nunique characteristics.\nThe company was founded\nby two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford,\nand everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance in mind.\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\ncan be worn while running or cycling.\nIf you get sweaty, they\nwon't fall off your face.\nAnd they're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the time,\nI can't even remember\nthat I'm wearing them.\nI wear ROKA eyeglasses\nwhen I read at night,\nso I wear their readers,\nand I wear sunglasses at various\ntimes throughout the day.\nThe great thing about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nis that even though they were designed\nfor athletic performance,\nthey have a terrific aesthetic.\nSo unlike a lot of so-called\nperformance glasses,\nthat make people look like\ncyborgs, in my opinion,\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nare the sort that you\ncould wear out to dinner,\nthat you could wear to work,\nthey have a terrific aesthetic.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A, .com,\nand enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, that's R-O-K-A, .com,\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Emily Balcetis.\nWell, thanks for being here.\n- It's my pleasure.\n- Yeah, I've been looking\nforward to this for a long time,\nbecause as a vision scientist,\nwho is also very interested\nin real-life tools\nand goal setting and motivation,\nyour work lands squarely in\nthe middle of those interests.\nSo just to kick things off,\ncould you tell us just a little\nbit about the relationship\nbetween perception,\nand in particular, how we see the world,\nand goal setting and goal retrieval.\nIt's a vast landscape,\nbut you're the expert,\nso I'll turn that over to you.\n[Emily laughing]\nAnd then, as time goes on,\nI may have some additional questions\nas it relates to\ndifferent kinds of vision,\nbut what's the deal with\nvision and motivation?\nHow do those two things link up?\n- Yeah, totally, I mean, when\npsychologists ask people,\nlike, \"What are you doing\nto help make progress on your goals?\"\nthey say all kinds of things,\nbut a couple things always pop to the top,\nwhich is, \"Try to shock\nmyself in encouraging ways,\nand self-pep talks,\"\nor, \"I remind myself of how\nimportant it is to do this job,\"\nor, \"I'll put up Post-it notes around\nto constantly be nagging me\nabout what I need to do.\"\nSo those are common\ntactics that people use,\nand what we'll notice is that\nthose are really effortful,\nhaving to constantly remind yourself,\nhaving to constantly talk to yourself,\nhaving to create those Post-it notes,\nremember to look at them,\nall of that takes a lot of\ntime and effort and commitment,\nand so what a surprise that\npeople burn out, right?\nIt's exciting to work on a\ngoal when you first set it,\nyou might make some initial progress,\nbut then eventually we get\nnot even to the halfway point\nbefore things get real, [laughing]\nthings are challenging,\nand we fall by the wayside.\nAnd that's, I think, because those tactics\nthat are our go-to strategies\nare themselves a goal to maintain.\nSo it's double sided, we're\nputting so much on ourselves\nto try to advance the thing\nthat we originally set out to accomplish.\nSo then, with my team, I\nwas trying to think of,\nlike, \"Well, what are strategies\nthat don't require as much effort,\nthat we can automate,\nthat we can take advantage\nof what's already happening\nwithin ourselves, within\nour body, within our mind,\nthat might overcome one\nof those challenges,\nthat'll be easier, more automated?\"\nAnd that's when we started to land\non the idea of vision, right?\nWe look at the world\nwithout even thinking of it,\nfor those of us that are sighted,\nand we thought, \"You know what?\nThere are strategies that we can use\nto look at the world in a different way\nand that we can automate\nthat might help us to\novercome some obstacles,\nto make progress on our goals,\nto maybe literally see opportunities\nthat we hadn't been able to see before.\"\nSo we started playing around\nwith the idea of visual illusions to see,\nlike, \"Do people even know\nthat there's other ways of\nseeing things around them?\nCan we tweak that, or is\nthere room for intervention?\nCan we encourage people to\ntake a new way of looking\nto see things that they\nhadn't seen before?\"\nAnd that's what really opened us up\nto trying to look at that intersection\nbetween vision science\nand motivation science.\n- That's great, and I always say,\nand here, I'm strongly\nbiased as a vision scientist,\nthat vision is the dominant sense\nby which we navigate\nthe world and survive.\nI love this idea of real-world,\nrealtime access to vision.\nAnd I'm certainly familiar\nwith how goal setting or Post-its\nand magnets on refrigerators\ncan have an immediate\nimpact, but then over time,\nthey become so part of\nthe visual landscape\nthat you overlook them,\nand we know, as vision scientists,\nif something is stably\nin your environment,\neventually, you're blind to it,\nso that makes good sense.\nSo you've published a number\nof studies in this area,\nbut maybe you could\nhighlight some of the more,\nwhat you would consider important findings\nin the area of how people\ncan adjust their vision\nin order to meet goals more\nquickly and more efficiently,\nand perhaps also how\nwe all arrive at goals\nwith different visual perceptions,\nand that, in some way,\nmay divide us into highly motivated\nand less motivated people,\nin other words, what's the link\nbetween vision and motivation,\nand how can we leverage that\nin order to better reach our goals?\n- Totally, so we started thinking about,\n\"What are the goals that\nare most important to people\nthat they struggle with the most?\"\nSo we asked hundreds, thousands of people\nwhat their new year's resolutions are,\nwe looked to all the other polls\nthat do the same kind of work,\nand regardless of where you look,\nor who you ask, or when you ask it,\npeople's number-one goal\nis something related\nto their health, right?\nTo lose weight, to exercise more,\nto get out, get more steps,\nfor mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing.\nAnd that's like the number-one\ngoal every January 1st.\nSo if we were able to\naccomplish that goal,\nyou'd think it would drop\n[laughing] a little bit in the rankings,\nbut it doesn't because it's really hard.\nSo we thought, \"I wonder if there's a way\nfor us to make some progress on that,\non helping people to exercise better,\nmore often, stick to it longer,\nand make some progress there?\"\nWe know diets don't work. [laughing]\nWhy don't diets work?\nFor the same reason that\nthat self-talk doesn't work,\nis that we go in it, full bore, hardcore,\nand it requires a major\ncommitment and effort\nto a lifestyle change.\nSo again, we were looking for something\nthat might be easier than that,\nthat could produce big payoff, right?\nThat's the golden ticket, [laughing]\nis something that requires less\neffort for a bigger payoff.\nSo one of the first things that I did\nwas go over to Brooklyn,\nto this old armory building,\nit used to be a military\narmory space, yeah.\n- I think I know that building.\n- Yeah, it's beautiful.\n- It's a beautiful building,\nnow, that houses a lot\nof businesses, right?\nWith plants on the walls,\nis that the one?\n- Yeah, there's businesses,\nthere's a couple of armories\nall around the boroughs\nhere around New York City,\nand the one in Brooklyn in\nparticular is now YMCA, right?\nSo it's a family YMCA,\nthat's within this beautiful\nold redbrick building\nthat used to be a military\nestablishment long, long ago.\nAnd what's really cool is\nthat, one winter afternoon,\nsomebody had invited me,\na physical therapist said,\n\"Hey, you should come out\nand check out what's happening here,\nwith your interest in exercise\nand trying to find new\nways of helping people,\nnew tactics that they can\nadd to their tool belt,\nI think you're going to\nfind some interesting people\nthat are working out there.\"\nSo I showed up, I look around,\nthere's families, there's\nnew moms, there's kids,\nmoms trying to get kids to burn off\nsome winter energy that they have,\nthere's people that look like\nthey're just there for their,\nevery couple of days, going out for a run.\nThere's some people that look like\nthey're training with a team,\nand that's who this physical\ntherapist introduced me to,\nwas the coach of this team.\nThere's a bunch of people\nthat were sitting down\non the ground,\nand I would be hard pressed\nto know who is the high school student\nthat's in this group,\nand then who, as it turns out,\nare some of the fastest\nrunners in the world.\nOne of the people that\nwas in the last Olympics\nbefore I showed up, won the\ngold medal for the 400 meter.\nAnd from the looks of them,\nI mean, of course,\ntheir bodies are in\nbetter shape than mine,\nbut there's nothing so,\nof course, they're not\nwearing their medals,\nthere's nothing pretentious\nabout how they're walking\naround or anything like that,\nthat would lead me to know,\nlike, \"This person's amazing,\nand they probably have some\ninsight that I don't have.\"\nSo once I got introduced to them\nand knew who are these people\nthat were part of this\npretty elite training team\nthat happened to work\nout at this family gym,\nI had the chance to talk with them about,\n\"What strategies do you use?\"\nNow, I am not an elite runner,\nand having recently had a baby,\nI'm not really a runner right now at all,\nbut I thought, \"When\nthese people are running,\nI bet they are hyper aware\nof everything that's going\non in their surroundings.\nWhere are they relative\nto the competition,\nwhat's happening in\ntheir peripheral vision,\nwhat's going on on the side,\nwho's behind them, who's in front of them?\nThey probably have this master sense,\nthis master visual plan\nat any point in time,\nand that's what probably\nmakes them elite.\"\nSo when I started asking\nthem, \"Is that the case,\ndo you really pay attention to\nwhat's in your surroundings,\nwhat's behind you, what's on the side?\"\nThey said, \"No,\"\nall of them said, \"No, and\nsometimes when I do do that,\nit's a mistake, it doesn't work for me.\"\nSo that was surprising\nand totally went against my\nintuition about what they do\nthat likely contributes to their success.\nWhat they said instead was\nthat they are hyper focused,\nthey assume this narrowed\nfocus of attention,\nalmost like a spotlight\nis shining on a target.\nNow, when they're\nrunning a short distance,\nthat target might literally\nbe the finish line,\nthe line that they're trying to cross.\nIf it's a longer distance,\nthey set subgoals,\nlike the person, the shorts\non the person up ahead\nthat they're trying to beat,\nor they choose some\nsort of stable landmark,\nlike a sign that they would pass by.\nAnd a spotlight is shining just on that,\nor they have blinders on\nthe sides of their face,\nthat's all they're paying attention to,\nthis really narrowed scope of attention.\nAnd that was a strategy that\nall of these elite athletes\nsaid that they used,\nand those that were\nbetter rather than slower\nwere ones that used it more.\nAnd I thought, \"Oh, that's something\nwe can play with, right?\nThey are elite [laughing]\nand they are accomplished,\nbut that visual strategy\nisn't necessarily something\nthat you have to be in the\nperfect physical condition\nto be able to adopt,\nand so I wonder, can\nthat help the rest of us\nwho aren't competing for an Olympic gold\nand who have no chance\nof ever getting one,\nbut who want to exercise better,\nhave a better time doing it,\nand maintain a commitment\nto that exercise goal\nthat they might have,\nthat they might otherwise,\nby February or March, be giving up on,\nif they had said it at\nthe beginning of January?\"\nSo that's really where the work started,\nwas what you might call focus groups\nor case studies [laughing]\nof these incredible athletes.\nAnd then we did other studies,\nlooking at people who\naren't Olympic athletes,\nbut who are competitive and\nNew York Road Runners runners,\nand how are they running in races?\nAnd what we found is that those people\nwho have better pace,\nfaster pace, better time,\nthey use that narrowed strategy\nmore often than this more expansive\nor open scope of attention.\nAnd there seemed to be a correlation\nbetween that better performance\namong a wider swath of\nhundreds of runners,\nwho are doing it competitively,\nbut still, could be like the person\nthat you're sitting next to in the office,\nor yourself, right?\nAnd the more often that they did it\nand the more consistently\nthey had adopted that,\nthat technique of the\nnarrowed focus of attention,\nit seemed that they were\ndoing better in their runs.\nSo then we started thinking like,\n\"Okay, what about people who\naren't competitive runners?\nWhat about like my mom,\n[laughing] can she do that,\nor me when I'm trying to\nget back on the bandwagon\nand exercise more,\nis this a tactic we can teach people?\"\nThe answer is yes, you can tell people\nabout what these Olympic\nathletes are doing,\nyou can tell them about\nwhat the New York Road\nRunners runners are doing,\nand just using the same language\nthat I just used with you, right?\n\"Imagine that there's a spotlight\nshining just on a target,\nchoose something up ahead,\nthe stop sign two blocks\nup that you can just see,\nand imagine that you have blinders on\nso that you're not really paying attention\nto the people that are passing by,\nor the buildings, or the garbage cans,\nor the trucks that are on the road,\ntune those out and\nfocus in on that target,\nuntil you hit it, and then\nchoose another one, right?\nSort of recalibrate,\nchoose the next goal.\"\nAnd so we would test,\nlike, \"Can people do that?\"\nI mean, if you're listening right now,\nyou probably are imagining\nthat experience too,\nand the answer is yes,\nlike, \"I can imagine that, I\nknow what those words mean,\nand I can do that.\"\nAnd our work found that too,\nthat people can do that,\nwe have them say out loud,\n\"What is it that's\ncaptured your attention?\"\nAnd of course, \"Sometimes\nsomething in the periphery,\nlike movement, captures our gaze\nand we are pulled there for an instant,\nbut then we can refocus up again\nand adopt that narrowed attention.\"\nNow, one of the first studies that we did\nwas teach that strategy\nand juxtapose or compare it\nagainst a group that we said,\n\"Just look around naturally,\nyou might see that finish line up ahead\nand there's things on the periphery,\nwhatever your eyes want to do,\nwhatever you think is going to work best,\nfeel free to do that, and tell\nus what you're looking at.\"\nThen we gave them a finish line,\nwe created sort of an exercise\nthat's moderately\nchallenging, but possible.\nWe put ankle weights on\nthat accounted for about\n15% of their body weight,\ntold them to lift their knees up,\nsort of high stepping to a finish line.\nSo this would be\nchallenging for them to do,\nbut we said, \"It's an indicator\nof overall health and fitness.\"\nSome of these people had\nnarrowed their focus of attention\nand some were just looking\nmore expansively or naturally.\nAnd what we found is that\nthose people that we trained,\njust everyday normal people\ndoing this moderately\nchallenging exercise,\nthey were able to move 27% faster.\nThey could do the exercise more quickly,\nand they said it hurt 17% less.\nThe exercise was exactly the\nsame for all of the people,\nwe set the weight, [laughing]\nwe set the distance,\nit was in our lab space,\nso it was a constrained environment,\neverybody was in the same\nsort of circumstance,\nbut yet their experience\nwas really different,\nwe helped them to move faster,\nburn calories at a higher rate, right?\nExercise more efficiently,\nthe amount of time they put in\nis going to produce a\nbetter physical outcome,\nand also, it didn't hurt them, right?\nThey're saying, \"It doesn't hurt as much.\"\nSo we were really excited\nabout that, right?\nBecause it meant that this strategy,\nwe could use it on people\nwho were not elite athletes.\nIt could be easily adopted,\na quick training session, right,\ncan teach people to look at\nthe world in a different way.\nAgain, this narrowed\nattention was different\nthan whatever they do\nnaturally, the comparison group,\nbut it had a big outcome,\nit had a big difference on the way\nthat they were engaged in the exercise.\nIt was some of the first work that we did,\nand then, since then,\nwe've done, I don't know,\ndozens more studies to look at,\n\"Well, what happens with that\nand what else can we do with\nplaying around with this?\"\n- Yeah, those are impressive differences\nas a consequence of\nnarrowing visual attention.\nCouple of questions\nabout the actual practice\nof narrowing attention,\nis there any indication\nof whether or not subjects\nare constantly updating\ntheir visual attention?\nSo for instance, if let's\nsay the goal line is in view,\nliterally, from the beginning,\nI could imagine just\nholding visual attention\non the goal line,\nbut if it's a oval track,\nor it's a trajectory along\na trail, or through a city,\nhow often do you think they are updating\ntheir visual aperture and\nsetting a visual goal?\nAnd I could imagine\nthat there's some\nenergetic expense to that,\nso meaning, you wouldn't want to do\nevery crack on the sidewalk,\nunless those cracks on the sidewalk\nwere very far apart.\n- [laughing] Right.\n- Because I think, at some point,\nthat itself would be exhausting.\nSo is there an optimal strategy\nor a semi-optimal strategy?\n- Yeah, so those Olympic athletes\nthat we started by interviewing,\nthey tended to be sprinters,\nthey were more often sprinters,\nshort-distance sprinters.\nSo when they said like, \"Yes, I narrow in\nmore than I assume an expansive focus,\"\nthat's because they're\nnot going that far, right?\nThey have to do it as\nfast as humanly possible,\nbut they're not going that far.\nAnd so we started asking\nthat question too,\nabout, like, \"Well,\nwouldn't that be tiring?\"\nAnd the answer is yes,\nso when we start to look at,\nwell, people who aren't sprinters,\nwho are accomplished,\nbut who are more long-distance runners,\nthat's what we find that they do,\nis that they're using\nthat narrowed attention\nstrategy strategically,\nand it increases in use,\nthey use it more often\nas the race progresses,\nand they really start to do\nthis major switch [laughing]\nat about the halfway point of\nsay like a 10-kilometer run.\nSo people who are seasoned runners,\nthey really start making a switch\nwith what they're looking\nat about halfway through,\nand that's where they more\noften, more frequently\nand are more intentionally adopting\na narrowed focus of attention\nwhen they're in the last\ncouple miles of a run,\nwhen maybe their resources\nare starting to get more thin,\nmaybe their motivation\nis starting to fade.\nThat tipping point in the middle is,\nwith any kind of goal, where\npeople struggle the most,\nand that's when they're doubling down\non a strategy that they\nknow to be effective.\nSo at first, longer-distance runners\nare not using that narrowed strategy,\nthey're looking more expansively,\nbecause I think that that,\nwell, first of all, distraction\n[laughing] is a thing,\nit's useful.\nNot necessarily that they're\ndistracting themselves,\nbecause people are still\ntrying to hold pace and jostle\namong probably a more\nconcentrated group of runners,\nbut it is a strategy that they use,\nand then sort of wean off\nof as the race goes through.\nAnd it's particularly effective\nwhen we're looking for\nthat last push, right?\nThe last push to get over the finish line,\nwhen you might be literally\nneck and neck with somebody\nthat you're trying to just beat out,\nor when you're most tired,\nbut you know that last push,\nyou don't want to drop off,\nand when you want to push through hard\nthrough that finish\nline, that's when people\nare using it at its\npeak level of intensity.\n- I see, yeah.\nTo me, this makes total\nsense why it would work,\nwithout going down the rabbit\nhole of visual neuroscience,\nsomething for another time,\nthat when we do these\nvergence eye movements,\nwhen we bring our eyes to a visual target,\nit's clear that some of\nthe brainstem circuitry\nfor alertness gets engaged\nto a greater degree.\nThe other thing is that we know\nthat when we focus on an object,\nthat the optics of the eye change\nand narrow the visual field.\nSo that brings about, this\nis a very detailed question,\nbut I'm sure the audience is wondering,\nif let's say I'm focused on a goal line\nor an intermediate goal,\nare they focusing on a specific point\nor is it kind of the entire\nhorizon of that goal?\nBecause the finish line is indeed a line.\nAnd of course, it's impossible to know\nwhat someone is actually\ndoing in their mind's eye,\nbut how do people report this?\nDo they see it literally as a spotlight?\nAnd if so, how broad is that spot?\n- Yeah, so what is the length [laughing]\nof their aperture rather\nthan maybe the diameter\nor the sphere size of it?\nIn our interviews with people,\nour sort of focus group studies,\nit seems like it's more\nlike a circular point.\nAnd that's in fact what\nwe're teaching people,\nwhat we're training them to do,\nso rather than going broadly,\nlooking across a line from left to right,\nwe are encouraging them to\nimagine a circle of light\nthat's shining on some target.\nNow, of course, a finish line is a line,\nbut if they're staying in their lane,\nif they're on a track, right?\nYou can imagine that\nthere is a circle shining\njust on where in their lane\nthey'll cross that finish line,\nor if it's a stop sign,\nyou could imagine a circle\nof light illuminating that.\nSo that's what we're\nteaching people to use\nand that's what seems to be effective\nto maintain that focus\nrather than sort of being pulled\nto engage with peripheral vision.\nAnd there's some amazing people,\nsome runners in history,\nlike Joan Benoit Samuelson,\nshe's one of the first\nfemale marathon competitors,\nwho has won multiple marathons.\nShe's Canadian, I think she's won,\nfeel free to correct me, like\n10 marathons in her life.\nAnd she talks about sort of not assuming\nthis wide but narrow, [laughing]\nwide but not deep or\ntall attentional focus.\nShe talks about, like, \"Finding the shorts\non somebody ahead of me\nand focusing on those shorts,\"\nuntil she passes them, and\nthen resetting that goal.\nSo in her interviews that she's\ndone with runners magazines,\nshe talks about it in terms\nof this circle of attention.\n- Mm, I think I've\nexperienced this a little bit,\nbecause we're visiting New\nYork now to do this interview,\nand runners here seem more competitive,\nrecreational runners here\nseem more competitive.\nPeople walking on the\nstreet seem competitive.\n- Yeah. [laughing]\n- You're walking at near pace\nto somebody, they'll quickly speed up.\nIf you speed up, they'll speed up.\n- Yeah.\n- I think there have been\nsome studies about walking\nspeed in different cities,\nand New York ranks among\nthe fastest walkers around.\nI won't mention the\nslowest-walking cities.\n[Emily laughing]\n'Cause we don't want to\ncast any judgments.\nBut fascinating, and\nagain, makes total sense\nbased on the way that the visual system\nmeasures both space and time.\n- Yeah.\n- Something maybe we'll get\ninto a little bit later,\nbut I'm curious whether\nor not the whole thing\nworks in reverse as well.\nMeaning, do people who are\nvery motivated to exercise,\ndo they think this way naturally?\nPeople who are averse to exercise\nor who find it hard to\nget motivated to exercise,\ndo they view the world differently,\nliterally?\n- Yeah,\nyeah, I have so much that\nI can say about this,\nso [laughing] if you'll humor me,\nI'll give you a couple\ndifferent stories about\nhow we can answer that.\n- Please.\n- So you don't have to do a\ndeep dive into vision science,\nwhich, of course, you\nare capable of doing,\nbut what I can share with you\nis some animal studies where this work\nkind of first started.\nThis is in the 1940s, 1950s,\nrat labs, mice labs.\nAnd they were looking,\nthose were the first\nmodels of human behavior\nthat people were trying\nto understand motivation,\nmotivation science within.\nSo they would deprive\nthese poor rats and mice\nof food or water,\nso that they were motivated\nto get it. [laughing]\nThey were hungry and they were thirsty\nand they had practice running a maze\nso they knew where they could\nfind that food or water,\nwhatever that they were looking for.\nAnd what these researchers were studying\nwas the pace of movement through the maze.\nSo as the rats were\ngoing through the maze,\nthey found that even though\nthese rats were hungry\nand they're having to expend\nlimited caloric energy\nto make it to the finish\nline, they actually ran faster\nthe closer they got to that finish line.\nSo once that finish line\nbecame nearer to them,\nthey actually used their resources,\nprobably suboptimally,\nto make sure that they\ncrossed the finish line\nand got their reward.\nSo that was some of the first early work\nthat was showing that proximity to a goal\nincreases the investment\nin resources that people,\nthat animals use to meet that goal,\neven when they don't have that much spare.\nAnd with the mice, the same kind of thing,\nthey actually had these\nlittle harnesses on them,\nthey were looking at how\nhard do the mice pull\nto try to make it to the food or the water\nthat they were trying to get.\nAnd same deal, the closer they\ngot to getting their reward,\nthe harder they were pulling,\neven though they didn't have\nthat much energy to spare\nand they had already used some up\ngetting to that finish line.\nSo that early animal research\nfrom the 1940s, 1950s,\nthen spurred a whole\nwave of work in humans.\nDo humans do the same thing?\nEven when they're tired, but they can see\nor they can feel that their goal is close,\ndo they double down and work even harder\nto cross that finish line,\neither a literal finish line,\nif we're talking about exercise,\nor a metaphorical finish line\nif we're talking about\nany other kind of goal\nthat people might have?\nAnd the answer is yes,\nthey called that the\ngoal gradient hypothesis,\nthe closer you get to the goal,\ngenerally, the harder\npeople and animals work\nto finish that goal.\nThat's what led us then to think,\n\"Okay, those rats, those mice,\nthose people are seeing\na finish line, right?\nAnd it's when they're maybe\nseeing that finish line,\nseeing that reward, seeing the goal\nthey're hoping to accomplish,\nthat is what's leading them to try harder,\nto invest more so that\nthey can finish it off.\nWhat if we induce that\nillusion of proximity?\nWhat if we can induce a visual illusion,\na visual experience that approximates\nwhat the real rats and mice\nwere actually experiencing\nas they got closer?\"\nSo that is what is happening,\nthat's what's happening visually\nwhen we create that\nnarrowed focus of attention,\nwhen we tell people,\n\"Imagine there's a spotlight\non the shorts of the person up ahead,\nor the stop sign that you're seeing,\"\nit induces an illusion of proximity\nthat then is responsible\nfor people trying harder,\nwalking faster, or feeling that\nit defied their expectations\nand that it wasn't as bad\nas they thought it would be.\nSo we do things like measure,\nlike measure their visual experience,\nlike, \"How far away is that finish line?\"\nOf course, we can ask\nthem to report in feet,\n\"How many feet is it?\"\nAh, but that's challenging, right?\nNobody really knows what three feet\nversus four feet really looks like,\nbut they do, so we can ask\nthem how many feet it is.\nWe also use these other measures of,\nlike visual matching measures\nto know that distance to the finish line\nlooks about as far away\nas this other target,\ntheir matching up their\nvisual experiences.\nSo what we know is that inducing\nthat narrowed focus of attention\nis creating an illusion of proximity,\nthat goal looks closer to them.\nAnd then there's all kinds of downstream,\nmotivational and psychological\neffects that happen\nfrom feeling like you're closer,\nby visually misperceiving that space,\nit can have a really positive consequence.\nSo your first question\nwas, \"Which way does it go?\nDoes it go both ways,\nthat people who are better runners\nhappen to do this thing?\"\nYes, some of our research shows that,\nthat if they, for whatever reason,\nhappened upon this strategy\nand continued to practice it,\nthey tended to be the better runners.\nBut we also know from our\nexperiments in the lab,\nwhere we take people who don't\nknow about these strategies,\nand by a flip of the coin,\nwe randomly assign them\nto either learn the strategy and use it\nor do whatever comes naturally to them,\nwe can create that illusion of proximity,\nthat has a direct and causal impact\non improving their performance\nwhen they're exercising.\nSo yes, it goes both ways,\nbut you can also teach yourself\nthat you don't have to just rely on luck,\nluck of the draw for being a person\nwho happens to be better at exercising\nor whose eyes happen to\ndo this on their own.\n- Before we continue\nwith today's discussion,\nwe're going to take a brief pause\nto acknowledge our\nsponsor, Athletic Greens,\nalso called AG1.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they've been\na sponsor of this podcast.\nAthletic Greens contains\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics,\ndigestive enzymes\n[laughing] and adaptogens,\nso it's got a lot of things in there,\nand that's actually the\nreason I started taking it,\nand the reason I still take\nit once or twice a day.\nIt essentially covers all\nof my nutritional bases,\nand the probiotics in\nparticular are important to me\nbecause of the critical importance\nof what's called the gut-brain access,\nthat is neurons and other\ncell types in the gut,\nin the digestive tract,\nthat communicate with the brain\nand the brain back to the digestive tract\nin order to control things like mood,\nimmune function, hormone\nfunction, and on and on.\nWhenever somebody has asked me\nwhat's the one supplement\nthey should take?\nI always answer, \"Athletic Greens.\"\nI gave that answer long\nbefore I ever had this podcast\nand it's the answer I still give now,\nfor all the reasons that I\ndetailed just a moment ago.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2,\nwhich are also very important\nfor a huge number of bodily\nfactors and brain factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nThe most pressing question\nI have in my mind is,\ncan we, I, all of us,\nuse this strategy to make the\nstarting line a goal point?\nBecause for a lot of people,\nit's not about going from start to finish,\nit's about getting to start.\nAnd I would say, here, I'm estimating,\nbut 15% of the content on social media\nis about motivation and how\nto get motivated to do things.\nNeurochemicals like dopamine, of course,\nbeing at the heart of motivation.\nIn my mind, I'm making strong links\nbetween some of these\nvisual aperture effects\nand goal lines and dopamine\nthat we could also dive into.\nBut the simple question is,\ncan I use this finish line strategy\nto make the start line a goal\nand get my system more\nengaged or motivated?\nAnd is there any physiology,\nor physiological changes, I should say,\nto reflect the idea\nthat maybe just visually\nfocusing on the start line\nwould actually get me more excited\nas opposed to make me less\nexcited to engage in effort?\n- Mm-hmm, there's certainly vision science\nthat's tied up in that very\nfirst stage of goal setting,\nlike identifying what that\ngoal is in the first place\nand taking those first steps.\nA lot of people's go-to\nstrategies that involve vision\nare vision boards, or dream\nboards, or Post-it notes, right?\nThey're creating some sort\nof visual representation\nof what it is that they\nwant to accomplish,\n\"Where is it that I want\nto be in five years,\n10 days, 10 years?\"\nWhatever that timeline is\nthat they're working under.\nThe idea of vision boards or dream boards\nis that you, almost like\na scrapbook, [laughing]\ncollect visual icons that\nreflect where you want to be\nto motivate yourself.\nIt's a really common\ntactic that people use,\nand it's not bad to do that, right?\nFor some people, just even\nknowing what they want in life\nis a major accomplishment,\ndefining the goal can be\nreally challenging for people,\nand that's a strategy that works\nand involves our visual experience, right?\nIt's not just, people aren't saying like,\n\"Why don't you just sit around and imagine\nwhat you want your life\nto be like in 10 years?\"\nThe strategy that people\nare suggesting is like,\n\"No, cut out the pictures,\nput it on a board and stick\nit by your bathroom mirror\nso you see it every day,\"\nright?\n- Or make a list.\n- Or make a list, yeah.\n- People are big\non these lists, I have a lot of friends\nthat are like, \"Have you made your list?\"\nThe list of things that\nyou insist on having\nin the context of fitness,\nrelationship, job,\net cetera, et cetera,\nthis seems more and more\ncommon now, yeah.\n- Yeah, totally, and the idea,\nlike, \"Write it down,\" right?\nThey're telling you, \"Write it down,\"\nor, \"Create a visual manifestation of it.\"\nAnd so yeah, that's effective\nfor identifying what you want,\nbut it may not actually be effective\nfor helping you to meet the goal,\nto get the job done.\nSo colleagues of mine\nat New York University\nhave probed, \"Well, why, why is that?\nWhy is just thinking about\nwhat you want in your life\nand sort of putting yourself\nvicariously into those shoes,\nimagining what my life will be like\nif I can accomplish\neverything on this list,\nwhy doesn't that work?\"\nWell, first of all, \"Does it work?\"\nThe answer is no, \"And\nwhy does it not work?\"\nBecause what happens,\nthese colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen\nand her research team have found\nis that going through and dreaming about\nor, \"Visualizing how great my life will be\nwhen I get X, Y and Z done,\"\nthat is like a goal satisfied.\n\"I have identified what it is that I want,\nI have experienced it, even\nif just in an imaginary way,\nI've had that positive\nexperience of thinking about,\nwell, how great my life is going to be\nwhen I get this thing done,\"\nand they start to sort\nof rest on their laurels.\nShe's actually measured\nsystolic blood pressure\nand heart rate,\nand they found that people who do that,\nwho go through that experience of,\n\"Visualizing how great my life will be\nwhen I get X, Y and Z done,\"\ntheir systolic blood pressure,\nthe bottom number on your blood\npressure reading, decreases.\nOkay, now, I'm all about\nfinding ways to relax,\nespecially in New York, right?\nYou're constantly living at\na high level of stimulation,\nand so like, \"Cool, great,\nso maybe I should just think about\nhow awesome my life will be\nwhen I get my bucket list done,\"\nbut motivation scientists know\nthat systolic blood pressure\nis actually an indicator\nof our body's readiness\nto get up and act, to do something.\nNow, that can be the going out for a walk,\ngoing out for a run, hitting the gym,\nit can also be things\nlike doing math problems,\n[laughing] right?\nEven if it's something that's just mental,\nsystolic blood pressure actually goes up\nin anticipation of your body or your mind\nneeding to do something,\ntaking the first steps on a goal.\nSo then it helps us to understand of like,\n\"Okay, if I've just\ncreated this dream board,\nthis vision board, and\nput myself psychologically\nin that space of a goal satisfied,\nwhy is it bad that blood\npressure goes down?\"\nBecause it means your\nbody is chilling out,\nit's like, \"All right, cool,\nI just accomplished something\npretty major,\" right?\n\"I actually now don't have\nthe physiological resources\nat the ready to take\nthe first step right now\nto do something about that.\"\nSo that was a pretty monumental finding\nfor motivation scientists,\nto understand that creating\nthese dream boards,\nthese vision boards, or to-do lists,\nmight actually backfire,\nbecause it in and of itself\nis the creation of a goal and\nthe satisfaction of the goal,\nand then people\nunderstandably give themselves\nsome time to just enjoy\nthat positive experience.\n- So much for \"The Secret\".\n- [Emily] Yeah, exactly,\n[laughing] exactly.\n- I guess now \"The Secret\"\nfolks will come after me\nwith pitchforks, but.\n- I try to never\nsay the name, [laughing] right?\nFor that reason.\n- Well, I'm not afraid\nto say the name, I mean,\nI imagine that certain strategies\nmight work for other people,\nbut everything you're saying, again,\nis consistent with what we know\nabout the physiology of dopamine\ncircuits for motivation.\nI have a good friend who perhaps\nincidentally, perhaps not,\nis a cardiologist at a major university,\nsaid that one of the major\nerrors that people make\nwith book writing and completion\nis they will tell people\nthey're going to write a book\nand people will say,\n\"Oh, you definitely should write a book,\neveryone's going to love your book,\"\nand they never end up writing it.\nAnd his theory is that they\nget so much dopamine reward\nfrom that immediate feedback,\nwith all the protection of never\nhaving the book criticized,\nthat they never write the book.\nI'm sure there are exceptions to this,\nbut I guess it raises the question,\nwhat's the better strategy?\n- Yeah, so I'm not saying\nthat people who enjoy dream board creation\nshould stop what they're doing,\nthat's not the take-home message here.\n- Nightmare board.\n- [laughing] Oh,\ndefinitely not that, no.\n- Okay, okay.\n- There's enough anxiety\nand fear in the world,\nwe don't need to encourage more of it.\nBut the process of goal setting\nshouldn't stop with\narticulating what the goal is.\nSo at that same point that\nwe're trying to figure out,\n\"What do we want to do,\nwhat is my vision for the future?\"\nin those planning sessions,\nwe need to simultaneously think about\na couple of other things.\nOne is how are we going to get there?\nSo take it out of the abstract,\ntake it out of this\nidyllic visual iconography\nand start thinking about\nthe practical day to day.\nWe need to break it down\ninto more manageable goals,\nnot just, \"My 10-year plan for myself,\"\nbut, \"My two-week plan,\nwhat can I accomplish\nin the next two weeks\nand the two weeks after\nthat's going to set me\non the right trajectory?\"\nThat's probably not surprising\nto anybody [laughing]\nwho's been thinking about,\n\"How do I set goals better?\"\nPlan big picture, think\nbig picture abstractly,\nbut then also break it\ndown more concretely,\nthat's probably not surprising,\nbut it's an important aspect\nof the goal setting process.\nThen, again, Gabriele\nOettingen in my department\nhas identified a third often overlooked\nor underappreciated\nstage that has to happen\nin the goal setting process,\nand that's thinking about the obstacles\nthat stand in your way of success,\nand that, it will actually\nhelp improve motivation\nin the long run.\nAnd sometimes people think\nthat that is counterintuitive,\n\"You're saying if I want\nto increase my motivation,\nhave more motivation,\nthen I need to think about\nhow hard it's going to be,\nall the ways that I'm going to fail?\nHow is that going to jazz me up?\nHow's that going to help me get\nthrough when things get hard?\"\nBut it does because it's\nlike coming up with a plan B,\na plan C, plan D,\nin advance of actually experiencing that.\nIf you were on a boat and\nthe boat started to sink,\nthat's not the time\nyou want to start\nlooking for life jackets.\nYou already want to know where one is\nso you can go to it right away.\nAnd it's the same thing with goal setting,\nis that you want to know,\n\"What am I working towards?\nHow am I going to get there?\nAnd if I experience this obstacle,\nhere's what I'm going to do about it.\"\nYou may never experience that obstacle,\nbut if you do, you're probably\ngoing to be shy on time,\nthin on resources,\nmaybe experiencing an anxiety\nthat hijacks your brain\nso you're not functioning\nat that optimal level of\njudgment and decision making.\nYou want to already have\nthe snap next step in place\nso you can just hop to it, right?\nWe're not going to do our best thinking\nwhen we're in crisis mode,\nbut we don't have to\nif we have already used\nour resources in advance to come up with\nthat plan B or that plan C.\nMichael Phelps, incredible athlete, right?\nThis is something that he and his coach\nhave routinely incorporated\ninto their training.\nSo I love this story that, back in 2008,\nhe was hot for the first time\non the international stage.\nIt was the Beijing Olympics,\nMichael Phelps was on the\nbrink of doing something\nthat no one else in the\nhistory of the Olympic Games\nhas ever done,\nwhich was win eight gold\nmedals in a single Olympiad.\nAt the time of this story,\nhe had already won seven\nand he had just the\n200 fly in front of him\nbefore he could do what\nno one else has ever done,\nwin the eighth gold medal.\nAnd the fly is his thing, right?\nThis should've been easy, a no-brainer,\nhe's going to win this, he's\ngoing to break Olympic history.\nAs soon as he dove into the pool,\nhis goggles started to leak.\nAnd by the time he had done\nthree lengths of the pool,\nhe just had to flip around\nand come back to the starting\nline slash finish line,\nback to the edge.\nBy the time that happened,\nhis goggles were completely\nfilled with water\nand he was swimming blind.\nI would've panicked,\nI would've sunk to the bottom of the pool,\nI wouldn't have even been\nin the pool to be honest,\nI'm not a swimmer, definitely\nnot going to be in the Olympics,\nbut for him, he didn't, it\nwasn't a moment of panic,\nlike it probably would've been\nfor nearly every other\nperson in that situation,\nbecause he had foreshadowed\nthat kind of possible failure.\nHe had imagined that obstacle\nhitting him in advance,\nand not even just imagined\nit, but practiced it,\n\"What will we do?\"\nHe routinely practiced\nswimming with his goggles\nnot fully secured on his face,\nhis coach notoriously would rip\nthe goggles off of his head,\nsmash 'em on the ground\nfor maybe dramatic effect or something,\nso that he didn't even have any goggles\npossible to grab as he's in practice.\nSo because he had\nforeshadowed that possibility\nand the solution, \"If my\ngoggles start to leak,\nthen I will do,\" in his case,\n\"start counting my strokes,\nthen I'll make it through.\"\nHe knew exactly how many\nstrokes it would take from him\nto get from one end of\nthe pool to the other,\nhe started counting his strokes.\nHe won that race, the 200 fly,\nhe won his eighth gold medal\nand he'd go on to win\n15 more in his career.\nSo we might not all be swimmers,\nwe might not all aspire to\nOlympic-level performance,\nbut I love that example\nbecause I think it helps sort of demystify\nor give us an alternative\nperspective on the importance\nand the motivational reasons\nwhy thinking about obstacles in advance,\nthinking about the ways,\nthe two, three, four ways\nthat your plan might go awry\nis actually effective at helping\nus to overcome the obstacle\nthat might otherwise lead\nus to throw in the towel.\n- That's a beautiful example.\nI'm going to springboard off that example\nto ask a question that\nhas also been on my mind,\nwhich is, is there really\nanything special about vision?\nBecause in the example you just gave,\nit was indeed vision that\nMichael Phelps was deprived of\nand it was counting strokes.\nCounting is another form\nof incremental measurement,\nin the nervous system, obviously.\nThere are others, they\ncould be the sensation\nof the hands smacking the water\nor breaking the surface of the water,\nso there are any number\nof different variables\nor metrics that one could use.\nI could imagine that setting out on a,\nlet's say, a three-mile run,\nwhich, for me, is a decent-distanced run,\nit's one I do a few times a week,\nI'm also not a runner,\nbut I try and complete some\nruns a few times a week,\nat very slow pace,\njust for my health.\n[Emily laughing]\nI could count every step,\nthat would be kind of exhausting,\nbut if I knew that three miles was,\nI'm going to estimate here, I don't know,\na couple thousand steps,\nI could count backward,\nI could count forward,\nI could count every 10.\nI confess, I spend every morning\ntrying to find sunlight\nto get sun in my eyes\nto set my circadian rhythm,\nand I do 100 jumping jacks.\nSo I'm the guy that people\nare looking at strange on the street.\n[Emily laughing]\nBut sometimes I count\nevery 10, sometimes I count backwards,\nsometimes I count forward.\nIs there any indication that it matters\nor is it simply that we\nattach some sort of meaning\nto that increment and the mode\nof reaching that increment?\nBecause it does seem like\nthere's something special about vision,\nand we could maybe dive into\na little bit more why that is,\nbut at a very basic level,\nhow broadly or finally should\none set the increments,\nand does it matter if\nyou're counting steps\nor counting strokes,\nmaybe it's every other song,\nyou're going to listen to an entire album.\nThat's something that I don't\nknow if people do anymore.\n[Emily laughing]\nOr you're going to listen\nto a whole playlist,\nand then listen to it again,\nand you're going to run\nas long as the playlist\nis completed twice,\nyou can obviously see what I'm getting at,\nbut I know people are going to\nwant to implement these tools.\nAnd I have to guess\nthat the nervous system\nis somewhat indiscriminent\nwhen it comes to these things,\nbut that there might\nalso be some specificity.\n- I think vision is special,\nand I think you do too,\nand for a variety of reasons.\nWhen you start, you can really nerd out\non how cool the brain is\nand how cool vision is within the brain.\nAnd when you do, then you\nstart to find some things\nthat make vision unique, right?\nMore real estate, more\nneurological cortex real estate\nis taken up by the visual\nsense than any other sense,\nmore than taste, touch, smell, right?\nVision gets more real estate,\ngets more neurological processing space\nthan any other sense, why is that?\nWell, because evolution has led us\nto prioritize the visual experience.\nThere's some cool illusions\nwhere maybe somebody's mouth\nis doing something different\nthan what you're hearing,\nwhen people sort of\ncreate these weird tricks\nthat might go on YouTube and go viral,\nand people are trying to\nfigure out, \"What did I hear?\nWhat did I see his mouth doing?\"\nAnd what comes up is\nthat people prioritize\nwhat they see over what they're hearing\nwhen the two are incompatible\nor kind of out of sync.\n- Every time.\n- Yeah, every time, right?\nIf you have to bet on it,\nbet on what it is that you're looking at\nrather than what you're seeing.\nAnd why is that?\nWell, [sighing] I guess, a\ncouple other things too, right?\nWe can see super far, you\ncan see a flickering candle\non a horizon if it was a totally clear sky\nseveral miles away.\nYou can see the\nInternational Space Station\nfloating up in the night sky, right?\nHundreds of miles away,\nour eyes are amazing.\nAnd we prioritize what we see,\nand I think that's because we never,\nwe rarely [laughing] get the experience\nof having our visual\nexperience second guessed.\nOftentimes, we're having a conversation\nmaybe in a loud restaurant\nand we know that we didn't\nhear the person, right?\nAnd so we say like,\n\"Oh, did you say that?\"\nOr like, \"Oh, I thought you said this,\"\nand they're like, \"No, I\ndidn't say that,\" right?\nSo people will correct us\nwhen our ears get it wrong,\nor we're tasting something amazing\nand we can't quite figure\nout what spices were in here,\nand so we know that our tongue\nisn't quite picking up\nthe taste the right way,\nand that's why we read the menu\nto see what are the\ningredients or we ask the chef,\nlike, \"What did you put in this?\nIt tastes amazing.\"\nSo we know that our tongue\nis getting it wrong,\nor you might be touching something\nand you look at the tag to\nsee what sort of textile\nwas used in this really\namazing piece of clothing\nthat you're looking to buy.\nSo we know that our sense of touch\nisn't quite getting it right.\nBut rarely do we have that experience\nof having our eyes get updated,\nwhere we're looking at something,\n\"Oh, I think I'm looking at my mom.\nOh, no, actually, it was\nactually my husband.\"\nOkay, that never happens,\n[laughing] right?\nThat we have gotten vision as wrong\nas we might get any other thing\nthat we're experiencing\nthrough any other sense.\nWe trust our visual experience,\nwe have a sort of a naive realism\nthat what we see reflects the\nworld the way it actually is,\nbecause it's never really fully tested,\nwe never get the input or the feedback\nthat you've seen something wrong,\nuntil a visual illusion pops\nup on social media, right?\nLike the dress example,\nor the last week or so,\nthere's been that horse-seal-lion drawing\nthat's been all over social\nmedia too, \"What do you see?\"\n\"I see a horse,\" someone\nsays, \"I see a seal,\"\nand then chaos erupts,\nor, \"I thought the dress was blue,\"\n\"No, I thought it was gold.\"\nI don't remember the options\n'cause I see it as blue,\nso, [laughing] right?\n[Andrew laughing]\nAnd it's dividing up\nfamilies and friendships\nbecause you've seen something\nthat the other person\njust literally cannot see.\nAnd that's why we love those examples\nwhen they pop up in\nsocial media when they do,\nis because it defies all of\nour previous expectations.\nIf this interests you,\nthere's a really amazing\nvisual artist, Anish Kapoor,\nwho plays with these ideas too,\nand his installations\nare just fascinating.\nI saw one at a museum once,\nwhere I walked down this long hall\nand it's just a big black rectangle\nthat's painted on the wall.\nAnd I was like, \"This guy's\nsuper famous, what the hell?\nIt's just a big black\nrectangle painted on the wall.\nWhat is this about,\nwhat a hoax? [laughing]\nThis museum paid how\nmuch, what?\" or whatever.\nBut then as you get\ncloser, you get closer,\nand your eyes start to settle in\nand they adapt to the\ndifferent visual lighting,\nyou realize it's not a black\nsquare painted on the wall,\nit's a huge hole he's\ncarved into the wall,\nand there is a whole other world\nthat's back behind there that\nyou can't see right away,\nuntil your eyes adapt to the\ndifferent lighting conditions.\n- Beautiful.\n- It's amazing,\nyeah.\n- As a vision scientist,\nI have to see, where is this exhibit?\n- It's not up right now,\nthere was a retrospective\nseveral years ago\nthat was done in Sydney,\nbut his work is all over the place.\n- Great.\n- So Anish Kapoor,\ndefinitely worth looking up,\nbecause, like the dress example,\nor the horse-seal-lion drawing,\nor artists like Anish Kapoor's work,\nthat is a moment that gives us\na different unexpected\ninsight about the world.\nThat it challenges us to see something\nthat we hadn't seen before,\nor it induces, or tricks\nus into seeing something\nthat we wouldn't have otherwise have seen.\nAnd so it's those rare moments\nthat I think are actually really important\nfor understanding what\ndo our eyes normally do?\nBecause we wouldn't find\nthese examples so surprising,\nso engaging, so shocking,\nif we had routinely gotten the experience\nof realizing we're not seeing\nthe world the way that it is.\nSo that is why I think vision is special,\nand why it can be thought of as a tool\nthat we can add to our toolkit\nfor how to better accomplish our goals.\nI'm not saying that we\nshould just only focus on\nimagining the world through\nan attentional spotlight,\nbut maybe that's something that\nwe can employ strategically\non occasion when we think\nit's going to best help us,\nwhen we need an extra little push to cross\nthat literal or metaphorical finish line,\nbut it doesn't have to be\nthe only tactic that we use,\njust like it's not bad\nto use vision boards,\nbut let's use something else also.\nIt's not bad to talk to\nourselves in encouraging ways,\nbut let's try adding another\ntool to our tool belt\nin case that's not enough\nto get the job done.\nSo I do think that there's great power\nin thinking about our visual experience\nalongside other tactics that we might use\nfor meeting our goals.\nAnd another one of those tactics\nmight be like the numerics\nthat you're talking about,\n\"Do I think about my jumping\njacks in terms of groups of 10\nor as a set of 100?\"\nYou do it routinely,\nso you might be able to set a goal of 100\nand have that sustain you\nthrough number 60, number 70,\nwhen maybe it's starting to get harder,\nbut for somebody who's just starting out\nand wants to be able to make it to 100,\nthat's probably not going to work,\nthat could be quite challenging for them\nif it's the first time\nthat they're trying it.\nAnd so instead, setting those\nmicro goals of groups of 10\nis going to be useful,\nbecause as we start to get\nto number eight or nine,\nor number 88 or 89, and\nit's really getting hard,\nwe need that extra little hedonic hit\nof pleasure of accomplishment,\nthe micro dopamine rush\nthat you might get by hitting\nanother decade milestone,\nanother group-of-10 milestone.\nAnd once we get that\nlittle hit of pleasure,\nexcitement or self-congratulations,\nthat might be enough to sustain us\nthrough the next challenging\nphysical obstacle,\nthe next group of 10\nthat we might experience.\nSo there isn't any\nprescription that I would give\nand say, \"Every person should decide\nthat 25 jumping jacks is the goal.\"\nNo, we have to be idiosyncratic\nand introspect about, \"Where\nare we at with this goal,\nthis thing that I'm trying to accomplish?\"\nand set those goals realistically,\nbut inspirationally as well.\nWe want to set a goal\nthat will challenge us,\nbut isn't impossible.\nWe don't want to set\ngoals that are too easy,\nbecause we're not going to trick ourselves\ninto feeling so great about\ndoing one jumping jack, okay?\nGreat, I'm pretty sure most people,\nif that's a goal, they can do one,\nso are you going to feel so\ngreat when you hit that goal?\nNo, because it was too easy,\nyou didn't have any doubt\nthat you could do that one,\nbut what about 25?\nOkay, yeah, I might feel\npretty good about that.\nWell, what about the next group of 25\nand now I'm at 50?\nThose are goals that might seem\njust beyond the brink of what's possible,\nbut I will feel good when I hit that,\nand that's going to give me the\nnext sort of boost of energy\nthat I'm going to need to\ngo a little bit further,\neither that time or the next time.\n- Yeah, I think vision is special,\nagain, I'm strongly biased here.\nThe reason I initially\nlearned about your work was,\nwell, now you have this amazing book,\nbut at the time, there wasn't the book,\nthere were just the scientific papers,\nand of course, upon which the book rests,\nand those papers are really important,\nbut was the relationship between vision\nand obviously is our sense of space,\nbut how the sense of space\nand time are related.\nAnd to make the idea quite\nsimple for those listening,\nwhen you narrow your visual\nwindow, you're measuring,\nthe time bin also gets smaller, right?\nWhich makes sense when you hear it,\nwhereas if you take on\na huge visual landscape,\nyou're actually carving\nup time differently.\nIt's sort of like moving\nfrom a slow frame rate\nto a fine frame rate,\nslow-motion camera is actually taking\na lot more snapshots, right?\nSo you're measuring distance\nover time more finely.\nAnd so, whereas strobe\nwould be the other example,\nwhich a strobe is very low frequency,\nso you're going here, here, here,\nas opposed to slow motion, right?\nStrobe gives a course\nview into the time domain\nand high-speed photography\ngives a fine view\ninto the time domain.\nSo I'm almost certain,\nwithout any knowledge of underlying data,\nbut knowledge of the mechanism,\nthat I'm almost certain, if not certain,\nthat by placing a narrow visual aperture,\nwe change the way we perceive time.\nNow, I have a question, and to be honest,\nI know the answer in advance,\nbut I'd love for you to tell us\na bit about how some of this\nworks still further in reverse,\nmeaning how unfit people view the world\nversus how fit people view the world,\nor how unmotivated people\nvisually see the world,\nas opposed to highly motivated people.\nYou talked about these elite runners,\nyou gave them Michael Phelps's example,\nbut maybe you could describe that study,\nI think it's a particularly important one,\nmostly because, yes, it identifies\nperhaps the physiological\nor psychological differences\nbetween motivated and unmotivated,\nor fit and unfit people,\nbut it also provides\na path to remedy that.\n- Mm-hmm, yeah, out of my lab,\nbut also out of several other labs,\nthere's been work looking at that relation\nbetween states of the body\nand visual experiences.\nThey haven't necessarily\ntried to integrate\nthe motivation science element to it,\nbut they were looking to see\ndo visual experiences change\nas a function of different\nstates of our body?\nSo they've looked at people\nwho experience chronic fatigue,\nthe elderly, people who are overweight,\nthose that are wearing heavy backpacks,\nand so who are sort of\nput into that experience\nof being overweight,\nwhat happens to their\nperceptions of the environment?\nWell, what they find is\nthat distances look further\nto those that are overweight,\nchronically tired,\nolder rather than younger,\nweighted down with extra baggage,\ndistances look farther\nand hills look steeper.\nWe've done some of those studies too,\nwhere we try to give people more energy,\nor deprive them of energy,\nand see does that change\ntheir perception of space.\nAnd we did that by sort\nof a classic technique\nof a double-blind study\nwhere the participant doesn't really know\nwhat they're experiencing.\n- I thought you were going\nto say, \"A double espresso.\"\n- Oh. [laughing]\nThat is also a good psychological\nexperience to give people.\nYeah, so a double-blind experiment\nwhere the participant doesn't\nreally know the full extent\nof what they're doing or\nwhat they're experiencing,\nand the researcher who's\ninteracting with them also doesn't.\nThey do this a lot in medical studies,\nyou give somebody a drug\nand you give somebody a\nplacebo, a sugar pill,\nand then importantly, nobody really knows\nwho's got what until you've\nanalyzed all the data\nand the results are revealed\nthat these are the\npeople that had the drug,\nthe active agent,\nsame idea in the psychological research.\nIn this case, what we did was\ngive people Kool-Aid to drink.\nAnd for some people, that\nKool-Aid was sweetened with sugar,\nan actual caloric entity,\nit could give them energy.\nOther people drank Kool-Aid\nsweetened with Splenda.\nSo, yeah, it's sweet,\nbut it actually doesn't\nhave any caloric value,\nyou're not giving people energy,\nyou're just giving them that\nexperience of sweetness.\nNow, some people, of course,\nare really good at identifying\nwhat's real sugar and what's Splenda,\nbut when you put it into\nKool-Aid, a pretty noxious powder,\nit actually masked it for everybody\nand nobody had any idea.\n- 'Cause it tasted like garbage\nto everybody.\n- It tastes like garbage,\nyeah. [laughing]\n- Sorry, Kool-Aid.\nI mean, I'm sure there are\nmany people that love Kool-Aid,\nI guess the sales of Kool-Aid\nwill reveal the data.\n- [laughing] Yeah, I grew\nup in Nebraska actually,\nwhere Kool-Aid is from,\nit originated in Nebraska.\n- Oh.\n- So I do feel like I'm\nbetraying my roots slightly\nby casting some shade on Kool-Aid,\nbut that's how it worked,\nis that we asked them\nto guess what they got,\nwe tested them afterwards\nand they were wrong.\nSo nobody's able to guess with accuracy,\n\"What was your drink sweetened with?\"\nWhich is important\nbecause they were blind,\nthe way that scientists use it,\nthey didn't know what it\nwas that they were drinking.\nWe give them about 10 to 15 minutes\nfor that sugar to metabolize,\nand we measured their\ncirculating blood glucose levels\nto make sure that we had, in fact,\ngiven their body circulating glucose,\nenergy that they might\nuse in the next activity.\nAnd the researcher, again,\ndidn't know whether they had\njust served sugar or Splenda,\nthen we asked people to estimate distance.\nSo we gave some people more energy,\nor we kept others sort of at\nwhatever their normal level was,\nand what we found is that those people\nwho didn't even know it\nbut who had been given more energy\nby drinking Kool-Aid sweetened with sugar,\nperceived their space as more constricted,\nthat visual illusion of\nproximity was induced,\nthey felt that their finish line,\nagain, in the context of an exercise task,\nwas closer to them.\nSo in just the same way that\nthese other physiology labs,\nvision science, physiology labs,\nfound that people who\nare chronically tired,\nwho don't feel like they\nhave as much energy,\nor those that are physically weighted down\nand for whom moving within an\nenvironment is more costly,\nwe could create that\nexperience for people.\nWe did an experimental version of that,\nthat if you have more energy,\nthe world looks easier,\nthe distances to a finish\nline don't look as far.\nSo that was some of the\nexperimental evidence that we had\nto show that people's states of their body\ndo impact their visual experience.\nNow, I'm a motivation researcher,\nso for me, the big question is,\nwell, what's the point of that study then,\nbesides just showing this\nconnection between the body\nand the eyes and the visual experience?\nWe think that that's fundamental\nto one of the reasons\nthat people experience difficulty\nwhen they're exercising,\nwhen it's really harder for your body,\nbecause of its physical\nstate, to move within a space,\nyou might say like, \"Well, why\ndon't they just go exercise?\"\nBecause the world looks harder to them,\nbecause that distance that\nthey're supposed to walk\nbecause a doctor tells them to,\nor that a partner encourages them to,\nor a hill that they should hike up\nbecause someone told them\nthat would be good for their health,\nit looks more challenging to them\nthan it does to somebody who's\nin better physical health.\nNow, if it looks that\nway, if it looks harder,\nif it feels like it might be harder,\nthen psychologically, we know that it is.\nWhen you have set yourself\nup, psychologically, mentally,\nfor that kind of failure experience,\nlike, \"I don't know that\nI have the resources\nto get this job, this looks really hard,\"\nyou're already motivationally in a place\nfor this task to be closer\nto impossible for you.\nSo to put it all together then,\nwhat we know is that people whose bodies\nmight make it more challenging\nfor them to exercise\nare seeing the world in\na more challenging way\nand that is having these\ndownstream motivational\nand psychological effects\nthat makes it less likely for them\nto try to take on the\ntask in the first place\nor to experience it as harder\nthan other people would or do.\n- Is the solution the same, however?\nMeaning, if these people are taught\nto adjust their visual goal line\nor to set a visual spotlight\non an intermediate goal,\ncan they overcome some of\nthis challenge that they face\nsimply by virtue of\ntheir skewed perception?\n- Yes, so in all of the\nstudies that we have done,\nlooking at that connection\nbetween this narrowed focus of attention\nand improvements in exercise,\nwe do not find that it only works\nfor the people who are in shape\nor that it backfires for\npeople who are out of shape,\nit works for everybody.\nThis is a strategy that\neverybody can adopt,\nbecause it's just simply about like,\n\"What do you allocate\nattentional resources to?\nWhat do you sort of ignore,\nand what do you focus on?\"\nAnd that visually induces\nthe same kind of illusion for everybody,\nregardless of whether you're overweight,\nor you're at your target weight,\nor if you're struggling to get there,\nor you've already accomplished\nwhere you want to be,\nthat visual illusion can\nbe induced for everybody\nand it has the same kinds of consequences.\n- Terrific, earlier I made a\njoke about double espresso,\nbut now I'll make a serious\nstatement about double espresso,\nwhich is that it contains caffeine\nand caffeine as a stimulant,\nlike all other stimulants,\ncause a change in our visual world.\nThe most salient one\nis the one that police officers look for,\nor parents suspecting that their kids\nhave ingested substances\nof any kind look for,\nwhich is if somebody's\npupils are unusually large\nfor a given visual environment,\nthat is an indication of high\nlevels of autonomic arousal.\nIn the street drug translation of this,\npeople who take amphetamine or cocaine\nwill have very big pupils.\nPeople who are very\nrelaxed have small pupils.\nHowever, everyone should\nknow that pupil size\nalso is dynamically regulated\nby how bright a visual environment,\nso there are multiple things\ncontrolling pupil size.\nHowever, we know that\nwhen we are very stressed\nor very aroused in any\nway, positive or negative,\nthe pupils get big,\nbut within the visual system,\nwhat that equates to is a\nnarrowing of the visual aperture.\nSo rather than ingesting sugar,\nwhich I'm guessing most of the world,\ncertainly the US needs\nto ingest less sugar,\nat least that's what we're hearing.\nI'm sure there are a few\nsugar sucro-nistas out there,\nsucrose-anistas.\n[Emily laughing]\nWho will also come after\nme with pitchforks,\nbut let's face it, most people\nwill probably be better off\ningesting less simple sugar,\nbut caffeine is a great motivator\nbecause of the internal sense of arousal,\nbut it also narrows our visual window.\nI could imagine using\nhealthy amounts of caffeine\ncombined with maybe even blinders\nof the sort that horses wear,\nmaybe like a hoodie and a hat.\n[Emily laughing]\nMaybe even blinders in order to get over\nsome of those more challenging milestones.\nIs there any evidence that\npeople are doing this without,\nwell, obviously people are doing it\nwithout knowledge of how it works,\nbut are there any studies\nlooking at how adrenaline,\nor epinephrine, or any other\nstimulants impact motivation?\n- I don't know, honestly, yeah.\n- [Andrew] And energy\ndrinks are a big thing now.\n- Yeah, yeah, for sure, they are,\nand if you actually are more\nphysiologically aroused,\nor jazzed, or whatever, amped up,\nor you just think you are, in our studies,\nwe have found that they\nwork in the same way,\nthat it can produce the\nsame kinds of consequences.\nAnd I like that because it tells us\nyou can actually change\nthe state of your body\nto induce these kinds of experiences,\nor you can just think that, [laughing]\nyou can trick yourself,\nyou can placebo effect yourself out\nand produce the same kinds of effects.\nI had to give up coffee like 12 years ago,\nand not for any.\n- I'm so sorry.\n- I love the taste, [laughing]\nand so decaf is my jam,\nbut I can't drink the caffeine,\nbecause it didn't actually do the thing\nthat it does for so many other people,\nlike make me feel more\nenergized and more awake,\nI just got sweaty and jittery\nand anxious and I couldn't focus.\n- Yeah, some people\nwho already have a fairly\nhigh baseline level\nof attention and motivation,\nthey find that it puts\nthe autonomic seesaw\ntoo far in the sympathetic tone.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- And I happened to marry\nthe same kind of person,\nhe also can't drink caffeine,\nbut loves the taste of coffee.\nThe interesting thing is that\nwe both have to have coffee\nin the morning to feel like\nwe're ready to go for the day.\nSo it's just part of our\nroutine [laughing] or whatever,\nto have that taste and have that sensation\nto feel like I'm ready to take on the day,\neven though, I mean, yeah,\ndecaf still has some caffeine in it,\nbut we're not drinking that much of it\nto probably actually create\na caffeinated experience in our body,\nbut we're tricking\nourselves psychologically\ninto doing that thing that,\nin years past, used to work for us both.\nSo I think that's\nsomething to keep in mind,\nlike you might have a\nhoodie that you can wear\nto induce that visual illusion,\nor you can take advantage\nof the power of your mind.\nAt the end of the day, I'm a psychologist,\nand I believe that we\nhave some non-zero power\nover what our mind is doing,\nwhat we're thinking about,\nwhat we allocate our attention to,\nthat can do the same kind of\nthing that a hoodie might do\nor that a cup of caffeine might do.\n- Mm-hmm, I completely agree,\nthe visual aperture is\nunder our conscious control.\nThat's an amazing feature\nof our visual system,\nwe can narrow or expand it.\nTakes a little bit of practice, I think,\nfor people to learn how to do this\nwithout moving their head around\nto expand their visual\naperture and how to narrow it,\nbut what I always tell people is,\n\"Just imagine a really\ntroubling text message\nor a really exciting\ntext message coming in,\nall of a sudden, you forget\nabout the world around you.\"\nSo it can be triggered\nby these outside events\nand we can learn how to\nanchor our visual attention.\nI'd love to ask about\nother kinds of goals,\nmeaning non-physical goals,\nbecause many people are trying\nto read more, I would hope,\nor learn music, or a language,\nor things that really\ninvolve cognitive goal lines\nor internal goal lines.\nReading one chapter out\nof a book each night\nis a tangible goal,\nthe other that I've often\nwondered about are these systems\nthat allow you to\nhighlight individual lines\nor even words on a page,\nthat's very visual obviously,\nand everything else is\nruled out except that word,\nI've always wished for books\nthat would naturally highlight each page.\nAnd as I say that, someone\nwill put in the comments,\nthis has probably existed for 10 years.\n[Emily laughing]\nAnd I'm just showing\nwhat Luddite I am,\nbut is there any example or\ntactic that people could use\nto better approach cognitive goals,\nof school, work, recreational too,\nbut that don't exist\nin the kind of fitness and sports domain?\n- Totally, yeah, so just to\nshout out to my brother-in-law,\nwho has done some of that research,\nwhere it does highlight\ndifferent parts of words in paragraphs,\nand he's found it to be an effective way\nfor English-as-a-second-language\nlearners to pick it up,\nthat that is, that tying that vision\nto the process of learning\nlanguage is effective.\nAnd so there's a whole cool body of work\nand researchers looking at that,\nso you're right about that.\n- If you want to mention what he does,\nis there a place that people\ncan learn more about that?\nWe can provide links if.\n- Yeah, let me.\nYeah, yeah. [laughing]\n- Okay, we will provide links\nto those resources,\n'cause I want those resources.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- I've been trying to\nlearn a second language\nfor a long time.\n- Yeah, cool.\n- I speak Spanish pretty weakly,\nbut I would love to get better at it.\n- Oh, yeah.\n- Okay, I'll approach you\nlater about that.\n- My five-year-old son\nspeaks Spanish better\nthan I do at this point,\nso yeah. [laughing]\n- And clearly,\nbetter than I do too,\nthank you. [laughing]\n- Yeah, yeah,\nyeah, so I was thinking that too,\nwe started this work within\nthe context of exercise,\nbut of course, that's\nnot people's only goal\nthat they have in life,\nand it isn't mine either,\nI have interests outside of\nimproving my exercise game.\nA couple years ago, when\nI was writing the book,\nI also had a child,\nthe same month that I had the opportunity\nto pull all this research together\nis the same month that my son came to be.\nAnd I started to realize\nI became a lot less\ninteresting once he was around,\nhe was fascinating,\nbut I was changing diapers and feeding him\nand that was it.\nPeople would come over,\nbe like, \"What's up?\nHow have you been?\nTell me something that's\ngoing on in your life,\"\nand all I had to talk\nabout was what was boring?\nAnd I just felt like, \"I've lost myself,\"\nI used to pride myself on crazy adventures\nand problems I would get myself in\nand I was a great storyteller,\nand that, all of a sudden, disappeared\nas soon as he came into the world,\nbecause he became my world.\nSo then I started thinking, like,\n\"I need to pull back some coolness,\nif I ever had it in the first place,\nbut I need to be a cooler person\nthan I'm coming across right now,\"\nso I decided, \"I want\nto learn to play drums,\nand I want to be a one-hit\nwonder as a rockstar drummer.\nI only want one song,\n'cause I know I'm not going to\nbe able to do more than that.\"\nI'm not coordinated at all,\nfrom the beginning of time,\nin fifth grade, I have this\nreally vivid flash bulb memory\nof playing basketball\nfor the very first time,\nI lost my footing, I knocked\ninto my own teammate,\npushed her out of bounds\nwhile she had the ball,\nwe lost the game and\nI was not invited back\n[laughing] on the team\nfor the next season.\nAnd so that fomented my\nself-definition of uncoordinated.\nI am a musician, but I am not a drummer,\nand the idea of coordinating\nfour limbs in real time\nwas like, \"If I could do\nthat, I would be so proud.\"\nSo that's a goal that I set for myself,\nat the same time that my\nson came into this world,\nwhen I was also trying to\nthink about goal setting\nand how to improve my ability\nand all of our ability to get a job done\nwhen you're faced with\nsome pretty big obstacles.\nSo I got to practice all these techniques\nthat we're talking about on\nmyself and see for myself,\nwhen I tell people, \"Hey, try this thing,\nnarrowed focus of attention,\ndoes it help with something\nlike becoming a better drummer?\"\nAnd the answer is yeah,\nthese tactics at least work for me,\nsometimes, under some circumstances,\nand they do for other people who try them\nfor other goals that aren't\nnecessarily about exercise.\nOne that I found particularly helpful\nwas overcoming my bad memory,\nthat everybody's memories\nare faulty, right?\nEverybody has sort of a\nwarped perception of the past,\nit might be skewed more\npositively than maybe we deserve,\nor it might be skewed more negatively\nif you feel that what\nlooms large in your mind,\nas you reflect on something from the past,\nor the mistakes that you've made,\nor the social faux pas that you had,\nor challenges that you faced at work\nwhen you got in trouble with\na boss or with a colleague,\nif that's what really\nstands out in your mind,\nor the good side of all\nof those possibilities,\nwe probably aren't\ngetting the world right.\nAnd that is something that\nour brain has evolved,\nto give us a faulty memory,\nto level and sharpen, to\nnot encode and remember\nand be able to recall everything\nthat we've experienced\nwith accuracy and precision.\nAnd that's a problem\nwhen it comes to assessing\nour own goal progress.\nWhen we want to be our own accountant\nand try to determine, \"How are we doing?\nIf I want to become a drummer,\nam I on track for getting there before X,\nbefore my time runs out?\nAm I going to make it or not?\"\nAnd I think that's an experience,\nwhether they want to be a drummer or not,\nthat a lot of people can resonate with,\nof trying to determine,\n\"Is this trajectory,\nis this rate of progress\ngoing to get the job done\nby X amount of time?\nWill I have my swimsuit body by summer?\"\nOr, \"Will I save enough for retirement\nby the time I hit 65?\"\nFor these goals where time is involved\nand there is a deadline,\nwe do take moments to\nassess our trajectory.\nAnd if we just rely on our memory,\nwe're probably going to do a bad job\nof assessing that trajectory,\nof knowing whether we're on pace\nto meeting our deadline.\nAnd I found that to be the\ncase as I was thinking about,\n\"Am I actually going to be\nable to learn this song?\nI mean, I know that\nit's going a lot slower\nthan it probably would for anybody else,\nbut to give myself a\ndeadline and a commitment.\"\nI decided I was going to put on a show,\nI was going to invite everybody I knew\nand also people I didn't know,\nand I was going to play\nmy one song for them, so.\n- This was while writing a book\nand having just had a child.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- So when you read the book,\nyou'll see my story,\nand it's the real truth of it.\nI mean, I did play that\nshow and it was fine.\nAnd then, because I wrote\nabout it in the book,\nthen some other opportunities\nto play it publicly have come up.\nAnd it's like, \"All right, I\ntold people I can play drums,\nI better show them\nthat I actually still can play this song.\"\n- [Andrew] I love it.\n- Yeah, so that that's been fun.\nI have become a one-hit wonder,\nif you ask me to play\nthe song, like, \"Encore,\"\nit's just going to get that\nsame song a second time,\nso literally one-hit wonder.\nBut so in the process of figuring out,\n\"Am I going to be able to play this show?\nI sent out invitations,\nthe date is committed,\npeople are coming to\nlisten to my one song,\nGod bless them, how's it going to go?\"\nAnd it felt awful, it just felt like,\n\"I am not making progress here,\"\nbecause there's a lot more things\nthat actually are pressing, right?\nLike the kid does need to get fed,\nI do have to go to my day job,\nthe editor is asking for\nthe next draft of this book,\nand that is going to take precedence,\nlike it does for so many people,\nthat things command your bandwidth,\neven when you have this goal\nthat you've committed to\nand that you've got on the books.\nAnd so I just felt this looming anxiety\nabout this goal that would require,\ndidn't have to be daily practice,\nbut you can't cram that kind of a goal,\nit does take committed investment\nfor a sustained period of time.\nAnd so I had this looming anxiety\nthat I'm not making good enough progress,\nbut that's because I\nwas relying on my memory\nand my brain to recall, like,\n\"How many times did you practice?\nWhat was it like the\nlast time you practiced?\nWhat was it like when you\ntried to play this bit\nor this riff like two weeks ago,\nhave you gotten any better since then?\"\nAnd it just felt like, \"No,\nI haven't practiced enough.\nI don't remember when the\nlast time I played was,\nbut it definitely doesn't feel\nlike I'm getting any better.\"\nThen I thought, \"You know what?\nI should stop relying\non my brain to tell me,\nwhere am I at and am I\non an upward slope here?\nI need to look at the data.\"\nI love data, scientists love data,\nso I started to collect data on myself.\nWhat I did was download this app\nthat a friend had told me\nabout called the Reporter App,\nthere's lots of these\nkinds of things out there.\nBasically, it just sets up your phone\nto randomly ping you\nwith whatever questions\nyou want your phone to ask.\nIt records your answers,\nyou can download the data,\nyou can make pretty graphs\nto see, \"What's my change\nand how I've answered\nthese questions over time?\"\nSo I did that for a month,\nfor a month, I had my phone\nask me a couple of times a day,\nwell, maybe twice a day\nreally, \"Did you practice,\nsince last time I asked\nyou,\" my phone says,\n\"did you practice?\"\nMostly it was no,\nand if yes, then it would funnel\na couple of other questions,\nlike, \"How did you do, how do you feel?\nCheck a couple of\ndifferent emotion words now\nabout your experience when you played.\"\nAnd I did that for a month,\nafter a month, went into my\noffice, downloaded the data,\nand first took stock before\nI looked at the numbers,\nlike, \"How do I think I\ndid over the last month?\"\nAnd I thought, \"Same as every other month,\nI didn't really get anywhere.\nYeah, I practiced, but\nI still feel awful.\"\nAnd I cried, I cried having to practice.\nI was upset with myself\nfor setting this goal\nand feeling so anxious about it.\nAll I remember is that I cried,\ncried too much about\nthis personal conquest\nthat wouldn't matter to anybody else.\nHonestly, it really doesn't matter\nin the scope of things anyway,\nI'm not going to become\na drummer professionally,\nso who cares if I\nembarrass myself publicly?\nBut what I found from the data\nwas my memory was totally wrong,\nI actually had practiced far\nmore times than I remembered,\nand when I looked at my\nemotion words that I used,\nit was a clear upward trajectory.\nYeah, I did cry,\nthat part I hadn't\nmisremembered or made up,\nbut by the end of that month,\nI had gotten a compliment from my husband,\nwho actually is a drummer,\nand said like, \"Hey,\nthat wasn't that bad.\"\nAnd then there was one expletive,\n\"You were effing amazing [laughing]\nat that one thing you'd\nbeen practicing at.\"\nBut like, \"Okay, fine, he's my\nhusband, right, is he just?\"\nSo at the moment, it didn't\nreally feel that great,\nand I downplayed it, and as a result,\nit didn't stick in my brain, right?\nI remember how stupid it felt that I cried\nbecause I can't make progress,\nand I downplayed in my mind\nthe thing that actually should've been\na legitimate indicator that\nprogress was being made.\nSo all of which is to say,\nI needed to collect that data on myself\nand to look at it objectively,\naccurately and completely,\nbecause my brain wasn't doing that for me.\nThat visual experience [laughing]\nof downloading that data\nand looking at what was\nmy actual experience\ngave me better insight\nas I was trying to assess the\ntrajectory of my progress,\nI became a more accurate\naccountant of my own progress,\nwhich is important for setting goals\nor resetting them when\nyou need to calibrate\nin light of what's left to do\nand how much time do you have to do it in?\n- I love it, so basically,\nif I understand correctly,\nwhen the intermediate goals\nof say daily practice,\nor twice-a-day practice,\nor reading, or math, et cetera,\nare not a visual goal line,\nit really does help to visualize\nsome aspect related to\nthat non-visual goal line,\nin this case, the Reporter\nApp was a useful tool.\nI've never heard of it, I plan to use it,\nI'm sure a number of people\nwill be interested in it,\nsounds like there are others out there,\nbut that's the one that\nyou found most useful?\n- Yeah, yeah, there's another one too\nthat is even more visual than that,\n[laughing] than the Reporter App,\nalthough that has visual components\nand is really effective if you like data\nand want to collect numbers on\nyourself or your experience,\nthere's another one called\nthe 1 Second Everyday app.\nThis is really awesome\nbecause the app is a mechanism\nto record one second of your life.\nThere's such an awesome\ncommunity of people\nthat just live by this and\nlove having these experiences,\nand the creator of it I got\nto a chance to talk with,\nand he has done this,\nhe's taken a one-second video\nof some aspect of his life,\nevery day, for, I don't know, 12 years,\n13 years or something.\n- One second?\n- Yeah, one second.\nAnd then what the app\ndoes is smash 'em together\nand give you a chronology\nof what your year,\nor your month, or your last\ndecade of life has been like,\nand presents it as like a\nstreamlined video for you.\nSo you just see these flashes\nof your life over however\nlong you tell the app\nto create a montage for you.\nAnd so when you see these\nvideos that people have made,\nespecially those that have been doing it\nfor a really long time, it's fascinating.\nI did that for myself too, I tried it,\none second of today's drumming\nperformance, another second,\nit's not enough to capture,\n\"Am I actually doing a\ngood job of drumming?\"\nor, \"What's my trajectory for drumming?\"\nBut the guy who made it says\none of the most awesome one-second\nvideos that he ever made\nis of a brick wall.\nI was like, \"Well, you\ndidn't need a video of that,\nwhat's the wall doing?\"\nIt's not crumbling,\nit's not in earthquake land\nor something like that,\nit's just slightly jittery,\none second of a brick wall.\nAnd I was like, \"How is that motivating\nor exciting to you, why is that?\nYou've been doing this for 13\nyears every day, one second,\nwhy is that the one second\nthat matters to you most?\"\nAnd he says, \"Because when\nit comes up in my montage,\nit reminds me of a really\nhorrific moment in my family.\nThat was the first wall that I saw\nwhen I walked out of the room\nhaving heard that my sister-in-law\nhad this awful, awful experience,\nher intestines started\nto twist up on themselves\nand knot up,\nand she was on the brink of death.\nAnd we had just found this out,\nshe had just gotten into the hospital,\nthey diagnosed this issue that\nrequired immediate surgery.\nAnd our family was there\nto hear about this,\nand we were all stunned\nthat she might die,\nlike, 'Right now, she might die.'\nAnd that's the first thing that I saw,\nand it reminds me of how precious life is,\nhow important family is\nand how the rest of whatever\nwe were doing that day didn't matter,\nbecause we all needed to be\nhere together right now.\"\nAnd that is all of this\nemotion and purpose in life\nis conjured up or reminded\nwhen he looks at one\nsecond of a brick wall\nas it pops into his video feed.\nSo if you're visually oriented\nand you do want ways to remember,\n\"What was life like,\nwhat has my year in review,\nwhat does it look like?\"\nthat's an awesome app, 1 second Everyday,\nthat can help you do that.\n- These are great recommendations.\nAnd a couple of reflections,\nfirst of all, the brick wall example\nis a beautiful way of highlighting\nthis other feature of the visual system,\nwhich is that the brain\nlargely thinks in symbols,\nit's very efficient,\nit batches entire\nexperiences into symbols,\nand in this case, the brick wall\ncan be attached to a\nwhole set of experiences\nthat are very meaningful\nto this individual,\nthat brick walls don't mean that,\nor didn't mean that to\nme until hearing this.\nSo I think that it highlights\nthe fact that the actual\nsymbol is less relevant\nthan what we attach to that symbol,\nbut that symbols are so efficient\nthat even in a one-second\nview of something,\nwe can attach to it,\nfor better or for worse.\nThe other is that I'm a\nabsolute, almost rabid proponent\nof people getting morning\nsunlight in their eyes\nas the fundamental layer of\nsetting their circadian rhythms\nand sleep and health as\na zero-cost practice,\nthat believe it or not, can be done\nany time of year, or anywhere.\n[Emily laughing]\nBut it does take a little bit of effort,\nyou have to get outside,\nyou can't do it through a window\nor a windshield for it to be efficient,\nbut it has huge outsize\neffects on human health,\nthis has now been demonstrated\nagain and again and again.\nAnd so I'm going to just do\na sort of call to action,\nif people aren't already doing this,\nI'm going to start using the 1 Second app\nto record my morning sunlight viewing,\nand prove that even through cloud cover,\nyou're getting more photons\nthan you are indoors\nand that it's worthwhile.\nI also would love to do\nthis for my next dog,\nto go from puppy to full-size dog,\nand maybe even to the end, who knows?\nGreat, these are wonderful tools,\nyou've given us a huge\nnumber of practical tools,\nwhich, frankly, isn't always\nthe case on these podcasts.\nWe always strive to do science\nand science-based tools\nas our kind of mantra,\nbut you've given a rich\nset of tools here to apply.\nI just want to briefly\nbacktrack to something,\nand then a final question.\nEarlier, we were talking\nabout how unfit people\nsee the world as more challenging,\nmaybe even hills as steeper,\ndistances as further,\nand how shifting people\ninto a state of energy,\neither cognitively or through\nthe ingestion of real glucose\nto get an energetic lift,\nor maybe through caffeine\nif that's within their practice\nand span of healthy\nbehaviors, they could do that.\nThere's so many people who\nare suffering from depression,\nwhich one of the key\nfeatures of depression\nis a lack of energy,\neven though there can be an anxiety\nassociated with depression,\nI have to wonder whether\nor not some of these tools\nare being deployed or will be deployed\nin the context of mental health,\nbecause depression is\nthis vicious loop, right?\nPeople feel a lack of\nenergy and hopelessness,\nand then things just look harder,\nand so then it just verifies\ntheir negative worldview\nand it's a downward spiral.\nThat's why medication, in some cases,\nand social sport, et\ncetera, can be helpful,\nbecause they feel more energized,\nthe side effects, often,\nare a problem, however.\nHave there been any efforts to implement\nsome of these visual tools\nto create this increase\nin systolic blood pressure\nand a kind of readiness and willingness\nto lean into what people\nperceive as immense challenge?\nAnd if not, for anyone listening,\nI know we have a lot of listeners\nin the mental health space\nand in the helping space, so to speak,\nI can imagine these are zero cost, right?\nWe all provide, with\npeople that are sighted,\nhave the apparati to do it.\nAre you aware of any studies like this\nor is your laboratory\ninvolved in any studies?\n'Cause I just see an immense value\nof implementing the sorts of\ntools that you've developed.\n- Yeah, we haven't explored\nthose ideas directly.\nSo call to all the scientists\nthat are out there,\nthere's a great opportunity to\nstart looking at these tools\nwithin the mental health\nspace, you're right.\nOther researchers though have,\nnot this use of inducing a\nnarrowed attentional focus\nand can they now feel more\nenergized to go for a run?\nBut they have looked at the\nrelationship between anxiety,\ndepression and visual experience,\nand found, over decades,\nevidence that people with\ndepression or with anxiety,\nwhat their attention is captured by\nwithin the bigger global surrounding world\nare those things that are negative\nor reinforcing of their worldview.\nNow, that happens for everybody,\nthat things that are on our\nmind tend to pop out, [laughing]\nthat whatever we're thinking about,\nwe might start seeing some version of it\nshowing up in the world around us\nthat captures our attention.\nThat's an idea called priming,\nwhat we're thinking\nabout might then lead us\nto attend to the world,\nto see things in a way that aligns\nwith what we're already thinking about,\nit's just that when what\nwe're thinking about\nare those depressive, ruminative,\nanxiety, fearful thoughts,\nwhen that is what is\ncognitively accessible,\nwhen that's what's going through our mind,\nthen that's also what\ncaptures our visual gaze.\nSo when we think like, \"The world is hard,\nthe world is full of sadness,\"\nand that's the thought in our mind,\nand then we start seeing the people\nwith frowns on their faces\nor who are experiencing anxiety,\nand that's what captures our attention,\neven when there's other people around\nthat might not be seeing the world\nor experiencing the world that way,\nit becomes reinforcing.\nWhen I think that the\nworld is threatening,\nand then I notice the\nthreats that are around me,\nthat confirms what I'm thinking,\nwhich heightens my anxiety or my fear,\nand then it further leads me\nto narrowly focus on those\nelements of the environment\nthat are aligned with that worldview,\nit's really hard to get out of that,\nthat's where the vicious\ncycle can come from.\nSo that has been really well established\nwithin the medical community,\nthis selective attention\nrelating to states of mental unwellness,\nthat's been pretty well established.\nAnd so there's been\nsome interventions done\nwith people that have\ndepression or anxiety,\nsaying like, \"Here's an array,\na photograph of a bunch\nof different faces.\nYes, it's artificial,\nit kind of looks like\na page from a yearbook,\na high school yearbook,\nbut look for the faces that are smiling,\nlook at the faces that are smiling.\nTry right now, spend 10 minutes\nhaving your eyes focus on those\nand look at those people,\"\nthat it is an effective intervention\nat improving [sighing] people's\nsense of self-efficacy,\nof, \"What can I accomplish next?\"\nThey feel a little bit more energized.\nIt doesn't cure depression,\nit doesn't cure anxiety.\nI mean, these are literal\nphysical afflictions that we have,\nso it's not a quick fix,\nbut it can produce a temporary change\nthat might be a way to start\ngetting out of that rut.\n- Mm-hmm, yeah, and I think nowadays\nthere's an increasing attention on tools\nthat will help people orient\nas they start to veer\ntowards suicidal depression,\nor veer back into a depressive\nepisode, or anxiety episode.\nI mean, trying to reverse\nan entire syndrome\nor set of syndromes is\nfar more complicated.\nLikewise, in the health space,\njust trying to get people\nto deploy realtime tools\nto adjust their anxiety or to\nexercise more often and so on.\nAs a kind of a final,\nbut also kind of a high-level question,\nI'm imagining that,\nand I plan to use this visual\ngoal setting of spotlighting,\nI've been using it actually\nfor some time on runs,\nit works really well.\nYesterday, I took a run\nnear the waterfront here,\nand I think I did it somewhat incorrectly,\nthe entire run, I was thinking about\ngetting back to the statue,\nat which I started.\n- [laughing] Yeah.\n- But I did find that I ran\nfastest in the final 20 meters.\n- Cool.\n- Which, admittedly,\nwasn't fast at all,\nbut it was faster than what preceded it.\n[Emily laughing]\nSo it works and it makes perfect\nsense as to how it works.\nYou've done other studies\nexploring some of the\nother features of vision,\nlike the luminosity,\nhow bright something is\nand how people perceive it.\nThat was in a completely\ndifferent context,\nbut is there a kind of a higher level,\na kind of a black belt version\nof what we're talking about here,\nwhere not only am I focusing\non a specific visual location\nas an intermediate or a long-term goal,\nor I'm using an app to ask me a question\nand tap into how I'm feeling,\ncreate a visual representation\nof my motivational state,\nbut that I'm also making my\nphone as bright as possible,\nI'm also trying to take that visual window\nand actually pay attention\nto more of the details\nat that location?\nOr is it simply a matter of kind of,\nin geek speak, visual neuroscience,\nwe would just call this\nlike low spatial frequency,\njust sort of grabbing a\nblack and white snapshot\nof something here or there in my mind?\nIf I attach more detail and\neffort to the specific thing\nthat I'm focused on,\nis there any evidence that\nthat's more effective?\n- It certainly changes what our\nbrains are doing, [laughing]\nso how do we define effectiveness?\nThat's a question for\nphilosophers and that scientists\nwill always debate.\n- Will it keep me running?\n- Yeah. [laughing]\n[Andrew laughing]\nIt will when you use it\ntowards the end of your run,\njust like you've picked up on.\nYeah, so there's cool\nstudies that neuroscientists,\nnot I, not coming from my lab,\nthat neuroscientists have done\nlooking at, \"What is\nit doing to your brain\nwhen you've decided that you're\ngoing to focus your attention\non this element of the world\nand not pay attention to something else?\nIs that just sort of\ntricking your thoughts\nor is it doing something different,\nto something more basic, more low level?\"\nAnd the answer is yes,\nso there's an area of the brain,\nthe fusiform face area,\nit's a part of our brain\nthat's really specialized\nfor making sense of faces.\nIt's important as a social species\nto pay attention to other people,\npay attention to their faces,\nwhat they're trying to\ncommunicate through their face,\nand so our brain has developed\na really specialized central\narea for doing that then.\nAnd so these neuroscientists\nwill present a face to somebody,\nbut superimposed over that is a house\nor something else that is\nless special [laughing]\nto us as a social human species.\nAnd so both of those things,\nbecause it's sort of like both images\nare sort of transparent,\noverlaid over one another,\nour eyes are getting\nboth of those images in\nand our brain is getting\nboth of those images in,\nbut we can will ourselves\nto focus on the house.\n\"Just really pay attention\nto the features of the house,\neven though everything about\nthat face is still there too,\"\nor, \"Pay attention to the face\nand just tell me, what is\nit that you are deciding\nthat you want to hold on to,\nthat you want to look at right now?\"\nAnd you can see that the\nbrain is responding to that,\nso when people are saying like,\n\"I'm really seeing that face,\nthe details of the face,\n'cause I'm paying attention to the face,\"\neven though we know their\neyes are also looking at\nand engaged with the contents of the house\nthat's right there, smacked on top,\nthe fusiform face area lights up.\nAnd when they're saying like,\n\"Nah, I'm really focused\non the house now,\"\nwe see activation in the\nfusiform face area decline\nand other areas of the brain's\nneurological real estate\nstart to engage.\nSo yeah, I think there's something to it,\nthat, at a high level,\nour brains are responding\nto our psychology as well.\nAnd we have that great power to really,\nwith intention, with practice,\ndecide, \"How do I want to\nengage with the world?\"\nAnd can it produce real\nchange in our bodies\nand in the way that we\nexperience the world?\nThe answer is yes.\n- Fantastic, well,\nyou've given us a ton of mechanistic\nand conceptual and practical information,\nso I'm speaking for a lot of
