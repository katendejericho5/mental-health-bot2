    "transcript": "[light rock music]\n- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. Charles Zuker.\nDr. Zuker is a professor of biochemistry\nand molecular biophysics\nand of neuroscience\nat Columbia University School of Medicine.\nDr. Zuker is one of the world's\nleading experts in perception.\nThat is how the nervous system\nconverts physical stimuli\nin the world into events within\nthe nervous system that we come\nto understand as our sense of smell,\nour sense of taste,\nour sense of vision, our sense of touch,\nand our sense of hearing.\nDr. Zuker's lab\nis responsible for a tremendous amount\nof pioneering and groundbreaking work\nin the area of perception,\nfor a long time his\nlaboratory worked on vision,\ndefining the very receptors\nthat allow for the conversion\nof light into signals that the rest\nof the eye and the brain can understand.\nIn recent years,\nhis laboratory is focused mainly\non the perception of taste.\nAnd indeed his laboratory is\nresponsible for discovering\nmany of the taste receptors leading\nto our perception of\nthings like sweetness,\nsourness, bitterness,\nsaltiness, and umami.\nThat is savoriness in food.\nDr. Zuker's laboratory is also responsible\nfor doing groundbreaking\nwork on the sense of thirst.\nThat is how the nervous\nsystem determines whether\nor not we should ingest more fluid\nor reject fluids that are offered to us.\nA key feature of the work\nfrom Dr. Zuker's laboratory\nis that it bridges the brain and body.\nAs you'll soon learn\nfrom today's discussion.\nHis laboratory has discovered\na unique set of sugar sensing\nneurons that exist not\njust within the brain,\nbut a separate set of neurons.\nThat sense sweetness and\nsugar within the body.\nAnd that much of the\ncommunication between the brain\nand body leading to our seeking of sugar\nis below our conscious detection.\nDr. Zuker has received a large\nnumber of prestigious awards\nand appointments as a consequence\nof his discoveries in neuroscience.\nHe is a member of the\nNational Academy of Sciences,\nthe National Academy of Medicine,\nand the American Association\nfor the Advancement of Science.\nHe is also an investigator\nwith the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\nFor those of you that are not familiar\nwith the so-called HHMI,\nthe Howard Hughes Medical Institute,\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\ninvestigators are selected\non an extremely competitive basis.\nAnd indeed they have to\ncome back every five years\nand prove themselves worthy\nof being reappointed as\nHoward Hughes investigators,\nDr. Zuker has been a Howard\nHughes investigator since 1989.\nWhat all that means for you as a viewer\nand or listener of today's podcast,\nis that you are about to\nlearn about the nervous system\nand its ability to create\nperceptions in particular,\nthe perception of taste and sugar sensing\nfrom the world's expert\non perception and taste.\nI'm certain that by the\nend of today's podcast,\nyou're not just going to\ncome away with a deeper\nunderstanding of our perceptions\nand our perception of taste in particular.\nBut indeed you will come\naway with an understanding\nof how we create internal representations\nof the entire world\naround us and in doing so,\nhow we come to understand\nour life experience.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nWe often talk about supplements\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nand while supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them.\nFor things like enhancing\nthe quality and speed\nwith which you get into sleep\nor for enhancing focus\nor for hormone support.\nThe reason we partnered\nwith Momentous Supplements\nis several fold.\nFirst of all, their supplements are\nof the absolute highest quality.\nSecond of all, they ship internationally,\nwhich is important because many\nof our podcast listeners\nreside outside the US.\nThird, many of the supplements\nthat Momentous makes and most all\nof the supplements that we partnered\nwith them directly on are\nsingle ingredient formulations.\nThis is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst of all, if you're going to create\na supplement protocol that's\ncustomized for your needs,\nyou want to be able to figure\nout which supplement ingredients\nare most essential and only\nuse those and supplements\nthat combine lots of ingredients simply\nwon't allow you to do that.\nSo in trying to put together\na supplement protocol for yourself,\nthat's the most biologically effective\nand cost effective single\ningredient formulations\nare going to be the most useful.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that we partner\nwith Momentous on, you can go\nto livemomentous.com/huberman,\nand there you'll see\nmany of the supplements\nthat we've talked repeatedly about\non the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.\nI should mention that the\ncatalog of supplements\nthat are available at\nlivemomentous.com/Huberman\nis constantly being expanded.\nSo you can check back there,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman to see\nwhat's currently available.\nAnd from time to time,\nyou'll notice new supplements\nbeing added to the inventory.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public in\nkeeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics\nand for frequent\nlisteners of this podcast,\nyou may remember that I'm\nnot a big fan of the word\nnootropics because the word nootropics\nmeans smart drugs or smart compound.\nAnd the reason I don't like\nthat phrase is that the brain\nhas many different circuits\nthat it uses in order\nto perform things like focus\nor task switching or creativity.\nSo the idea that there's a\nsingle thing that we would call\na smart drug is simply not\nin concert with the biology.\nWell, Thesis understands this,\nand as a consequence has\ndeveloped custom nootropic\nformulations that are\ntailored to your unique needs.\nSo for instance,\nThesis will allow you to\ntry different blends over\nthe course of a month and determine\nwhich blends of specific\ningredients work best\nfor you to focus or for\nyou to gain motivation\nand energy for workouts or\nfor cognitive work of some sort.\nI've been using Thesis custom nootropics\nfor well over six months now.\nAnd they completely transform\nthe way that I do cognitive\nwork and indeed the way\nthat I do physical fitness,\nif you want to try your\nown personalized nootropic starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nThere you'll just do a brief\nthree minute quiz and Thesis will\nsend you four different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by two\nall American swimmers from Stanford\nand everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance\nin mind and with the biology\nof the visual system in mind,\nI spent my lifetime working\non the visual system,\nand I can tell you that your\nvisual system has to contend\nwith a number of very\nimportant challenges in order\nto be able to see the\nworld around you clearly,\nthings like adjusting for\nbackground illumination so that\nwhen you go from a sunny\narea to a shady area,\nyou can see what's in front\nof you still with crystal clarity.\nROKA takes all of that into account\nwhen designing their\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\ntheir eyeglasses and sunglasses\nalso have some unique\nqualities for instance,\nbecause they were initially designed\nfor performance with things\nlike running and cycling.\nIf you get sweaty, they\nwon't fall off your face.\nAlso they're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the time,\nI don't even remember\nthat I'm wearing them.\nI wear ROKA eyeglasses at night.\nSo I wear readers and\nI wear sunglasses often\nduring the day, if it's very\nbright or if I'm driving,\nif you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA\nthat's roka.com and enter\nthe code Huberman to save\n20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are uniquely tailored\nto your sleep needs.\nI've talked repeatedly\nabout the fact that sleep\nis the foundation of mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nSo getting adequate deep\nsleep is absolutely essential.\nNow, one of the key things to getting\na great night's sleep is to make sure\nthat the surface that you're sleeping on\nis the right one for you.\nHelix understands this,\nand they've created a sleep quiz.\nThat is you go to their\nwebsite and you fill out\na brief quiz that asks questions\nlike you sleep on your side,\nyour back, your stomach.\nDo you tend to run hotter\ncold during the night?\nMaybe you don't know the answers.\nIn which case you simply\nsay you don't know,\nby taking that quiz,\nthey will match you to a mattress\nthat is ideal for your sleep needs.\nI took that quiz and I\nmatched to the so-called Dusk,\nD-U-S-K mattress.\nAnd I've been sleeping on that\nmattress for some time now,\nand it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress to one,\nthat's uniquely tailored\nto your sleep needs,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to\na customized mattress.\nAnd you'll get up to $200\noff any mattress order\nand two free pillows.\nThey have a 10 year warranty\nand you get to try out\nthat mattress for a\nhundred nights, risk free.\nThey'll even pick it up for\nyou if you don't love it,\nbut I do believe\nthat you will love it because you'll be\nsleeping far better than you have before.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nto get up to $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Charles Zuker,\nCharles, thank you so\nmuch for joining me today.\n- My pleasure.\n- I want to ask you\nabout many things related\nto taste and gustatory perception,\nbut maybe to start off\nand because you've worked\non a number of different\ntopics in neuroscience,\nnot just taste,\nhow do you think about perception,\nor rather, I should say,\nhow should the world and\npeople think about perception,\nhow it's different from\nsensation and what leads\nto our experience of\nlife in terms of vision,\nhearing, taste, et cetera?\n- So the brain is an extra ordinary organ\nthat weights maybe 2% of your body mass.\nYet it consumes anywhere between 25\nto 30% of all of your energy and oxygen.\nAnd it gets transformed into a mind\nand this mind changes the human condition.\nIt make, it changes, it\ntransforms fear into courage,\nconformity into creativity,\nsadness into happiness.\nHow the hell does that happen?\nNow, the challenge that the brain faces\nis that the world is made of real things.\nYou know, this here is a glass,\nand this is a cord and\nthis is a microphone,\nbut the brain is only made of neurons\nthat only understand electrical signals.\nSo how do you transform\nthat reality into nothing\nthat electrical signals that now need\nto represent the world?\nAnd that process\nis what we can operationally\ndefine as perception,\nin the senses, let's say olfactory,\nother taste, vision we\ncan very straightforwardly\nseparate detection from perception,\ndetection is what happens when\nyou take a sugar molecule,\nyou put it in your tongue and\nthen a set of specific cells\nnow sense that sugar\nmolecule that's detection,\nyou haven't perceived anything yet.\nThat is just your cells in your tongue,\ninteracting with this chemical.\nBut now that cell gets\nactivated and sends a signal\nto the brain and now detection\ngets transformed into perception.\nAnd he's trying to\nunderstand how that happens.\nThat's been the maniacal drive,\nof my entire career in neuroscience.\nHow does the brain ultimately\ntransform detection\ninto perception so that it can\nguide actions and behaviors?\nDoes that make sense?\n- Absolutely.\nAnd is a very clear and\nbeautiful description,\na sort of high level\nquestion related to that.\nAnd then I think we can get\ninto some of the intermediate steps.\nI think many people would\nlike to know whether\nor not my perception of the color\nof your shirt is the\nsame as your perception\nof the color of your shirt.\n- Excellent question.\nAm I okay to interrupt you\nas I'm guessing what you're going?\n- Interruption is welcome on this podcast.\nThe audience will always penalize me\nfor interrupting you,\nand will never penalize\nyou for interrupting me.\n- Good, I like the one way penalize.\nNow, given what I told you before\nthat the brain is trying to represent\nthe world based in nothing\nbut the transformation of\nthese signals into electrical\nlanguages that now neurons\nhad to encode and decode.\nIt follows that your brain\nis different than my brain.\nAnd therefore it follows that\nthe way that you are perceiving\nthe world must be different\nthan mine, even when receiving\nthe same sensory cues.\nAnd I'll tell you about an experiment\nis a simple experiment yet brilliant.\nThat demonstrates why\nwe perceive the world,\nhow we perceive the world different.\nSo in the world of vision, as you know,\nwell now we have three classes\nof photo receptor neurons\nthat sense three basic\ncolors, red, blue, and green.\nBlue, green, and red\nif we go from short to long wavelength\nand these three are\nsufficient to accommodate\nthe full visible spectra,\nI'm going to take three light projectors,\nand I'm going to project\nwith one into a wide screen,\na red light, and the\nother one green light,\nI'm going to overlap the two beams.\nAnd on the screen, there's be yellow.\nThis is the superposition\nwhen you have two beams of red and green,\nand then I'm going to\ntake a third projector\nand I'm going to put a filter\nthat projects right\nnext to that mixed beam,\na spectral pure yellow.\nAnd I'm going to ask you to\ncome to the red and green\nprojectors and play with intensity knobs\nso that you can match that yellow\nthat you're projecting to the\nspectrally pure next to it.\nIs this making sense?\n- Perfect sense.\n- And I'm going to write down the numbers\nin those two volume\nintensity knobs and then I'm going to ask\nthe next person to do the same.\nAnd then I'm going to\nask every person around\nthis area of Battery Park\nin New York to do the same,\nand guess what, we're going to end up\nwith thousands of different\nnumber combinations.\n- Amazing.\n- So for all of us,\nis yellow enough that we\ncan use a common language,\nbut for every one of us,\nthat yellow is going to be\never so slightly differently.\nAnd so I think that simple\npsychological experiment\nbeautifully illustrates\nhow we truly perceive\nthe world differently.\n- I love that example.\nAnd yet, in that example,\nwe know the basic elements\nfrom which color is created.\nIf we migrate into a\nslightly different sense,\nlet me pick a hard one, like-\n- Sound.\n- Sound, olfaction.\n- Very hard then to do an experiment\nthat will allow us to get that degree\nof granularity and beautiful causality,\nwhere we can show that A\nproduces and leads to B.\nIf I give you the smell of a rose,\nyou can describe it to me.\nIf I smell the same rose,\nI can describe it also,\nbut I have no way whether\nthe two of us are experiencing the same,\nbut it's close enough that\nwe can both pretty much say\nthat it has the following enough features\nor other determinants,\nbut no question that your\nexperience is different than mine.\n- The fact that it's good\nenough for us to both survive\nthat your perception of yellow\nand my perception of yellow at least up\nuntil now is good enough\nfor us both to survive.\n- You got it.\n- Raises a thought\nabout a statement made by a colleague\nof ours, Marcus Meister at Caltech.\nIt's never been on this podcast,\nbut in a review that I read\nby Marcus, at one point,\nhe said that the basic\nfunction of perception\nis to divide our behavioral responses\ninto the outcomes downstream\nof three basic emotional responses.\nYum.\nI like it.\nYuck.\nI hate it.\nOr meh, whatever.\nWhat do you think about,\nI'm not looking to establish a debate\nbetween you and Marcus,\nwithout Marcus here.\n- I understand that.\n- But what I like about\nthat is that it seems like\nwe know the brain is a very\neconomical organ in some sense,\ndespite its high metabolic\ndemands and this variation\nin perception from one\nindividual to the next, at once,\nseems like a problem because\nwe're all literally\nseeing different things.\nAnd yet we function,\nwe function well enough for\nmost of us to avoid death\nand cliffs and eating poisons and so forth\nand to enjoy some aspects\nof life one hopes.\nSo is there a general statement\nthat we can about the brain,\nnot just as a organ to\ngenerate perception,\nnot just as an organ to keep us alive,\nbut also an organ that is trying to batch\nour behaviors into general\ncategories of outcome?\n- I think so, but, and again,\nI think the world of Marcus too,\nand I think he's right\nthat broadly speaking,\nyou could categorize a\nlot of behaviors falling\ninto those two categories\nand that's 100% likely\nto be the case for\nanimals in the wild where\nthe choices are not necessarily binary,\nbut they're very unique and distinct.\nDo I want to eat this?\nDo I want to kill that?\nDo I want to go there?\nOr do I want to go here?\nWe humans deviated from\nthat world long ago.\nAnd learned to experience life\nwhere we do things that\nwe should not be doing.\n- Some of us more than others.\n- Exactly.\nYou know, in my own world of taste,\nthe likelihood that an animal\nin the wild will enjoy\neating something bitter\nit's inconceivable, yet\nwe love tonic water.\nWe enjoy, we like living on the edge.\nWe love enjoying experiences\nthat makes us human.\nAnd that goes beyond that\nsimple set of categories,\nwhich is yummy, yukky, ah, who cares.\nAnd so I think it's not a bad palette,\nbut I think it's overly reductionist\nfor certainly what we humans do.\n- I agree.\nAnd since we're here in New York,\nI can say that the many options,\nthe extensive variety of food,\nflora and fauna in New York explains\na lot of the more nuanced\nbehaviors that we observe.\nLet's talk about taste because although\nyou've done extensive work\nin the field of vision,\nand it's a topic that\nI love you could spend\nall day on taste is fascinating.\nFirst of all, I'd like to know\nwhy you migrated from studying\nvision to studying taste.\nAnd perhaps in that description,\nyou could highlight to us\nwhy we should think about\nand how we should think\nabout this sense of taste.\n- My goal has been to understand,\nas I highlighted before how\nthe brain does its magic,\nyou know what part you\nmight wonder, ideally,\nI like to help contribute\nto understand all of it.\nYou know how do you encode\nand decode emotions?\nHow do you encode and\ndecode memories and actions?\nHow do you make decisions?\nHow do you transform\ndetection into perception?\nAnd the list goes on and on.\nBut one of the key things\nin science, as you know,\nis ensuring that you always\nask the right question\nso that you have a\npossibility of answering it.\nBecause if the question\ncannot be tractable or reduced\nto an experimental path\nthat helps you resolve it,\nthen we end up doing\nsome really fun science,\nbut not necessarily answering\nthe important problem\nthat we want to study.\nMake sense?\n- From a first person perspective, yes.\nThe hardest question,\nthe most important question\nis what are you going\nto try and answer.\n- You got it.\nAnd so for example\nI will have to understand\nthe neural basis of empathy.\n- [Andrew] There's a big market for that.\n- 100%, but I wouldn't even know.\nI mean, at the molecular\nlevel, that's what we do.\nHow do the circuits in your\nbrain create that sense?\nI have no clue how to do it.\nI can come up with ways to think about it,\nbut I like to understand what\nin your brain makes someone\na great philanthropist.\nWhat is the neural basis of love?\nI wouldn't even know where to begin.\nSo if I want to begin to study\nthese questions about brain function,\nthat can cover so many\naspects of the brain,\nI need to choose a problem\nthat affords me that window.\nBut in a way that I can ask questions\nthat get me answers and among the senses\nthat have the capacity\nof transforming detection into perception\nof being stored as memories\nor creating emotions,\nof giving you different\nactions and perceptions\nas a function of the internal state.\nYou know, when you're hungry,\nthings taste very differently\nthat when you're sated,\nhow, why?\nWhen you taste something,\nyou now remember this amazing meal\nyou had with your first\ndate, how does that happen?\nSo if I want to begin to\nexplore all of these things\nthat the brain does,\nI felt I have to choose a\nsensory system that affords\nsome degree of simplicity in the way\nthat the input output\nrelationships are put together.\nAnd in a way that still can\nbe used to ask every one\nof these problems that the brain\nhas to ultimately compute,\nencode and decode.\nAnd what's remarkable\nabout the taste system at the time\nthat I began working on this\nis that nothing was known\nabout the molecular basis of taste.\nYou know, we knew that we could taste\nwhat has been usually defined as\nthe five basic taste\nqualities, sweet, sour,\nbitter, salty, and umami,\numami is a Japanese word\nthat means yummy, delicious.\nAnd that's nearly every animal species,\nthe taste of amino acids.\nAnd in humans, it's mostly\nassociated with the taste of MSG,\nmonosodium glutamate, one\namino acid in particular.\n- What are just by way of example,\nsome foods that are rich in\nthe umami evoking stimulation?\n- Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese,\neh, and it's a great,\ngreat flavor enhancer.\nIt enriches our sensory experience.\nAnd so the beautiful thing of the system\nis that the lines of\ninput are limited to five.\nYou know, sweet, sour,\nbitter, salt and umami,\nand each of them has a\npredetermined meaning,\nyou are born liking sugar\nand disliking bitter.\nYou have no choice.\nThese are hard wire systems,\nbut of course you can\nlearn to dislike sugar\nand to like bitters, but in the while,\nlet's take humans out of the question,\nthese are a hundred percent predetermined.\nYou are born with that specific\nvalance value for each taste\nof sweet, umami and low salt\nare attractive taste qualities.\nThey evoke appetitive responses,\nI want to consume them.\nAnd bitter and sour are innately,\npredetermined to be aversive.\n- Could I interrupt you just briefly\nand ask a question about that exact point\nfor something to be appetitive to and some\nother taste to be aversive\nand for those to be hardwired,\ncan we assume that the\nsensation of very bitter\nor of activation of bitter receptors\nin the mouth activates a neural circuit\nthat causes closing of the mouth,\nretraction of the tongue\nand retraction of the body\nand that the taste of something sweet\nmight actually induce more licking?\n- 100%, you got it,\nthe activation of the\nreceptors in the tongue\nthat recognize sweet versus the ones\nthat recognize bitter activate\nan entire behavioral program.\nAnd that program that we\ncan refer as appetitiveness\nor aversion it's composed of\nmany different subroutines,\nin the case of bitter is very\neasy to actually look at,\nsee them happening in animals.\nBecause the first thing\nyou do is you stop licking.\nThen you put unhappy face,\nthen you squint your eyes\nand then you start gagging.\nAnd that entire thing\nhappens by the activation\nof a bitter molecule\nin a bitter sensing cell in your tongue.\n- It's incredible.\n- It's again,\nthe magic of the brain,\nhow it it's able to encode\nand decode these extraordinary\nactions and behaviors in\nresponse of nothing but a simple,\nvery unique sensory stimuli.\nNow, let me say that this\npallet of five basic tastes\naccommodates all the dietary\nneeds of the organism.\nSweet to ensure that we get\nthe right amount of energy,\numami, to ensure that we get proteins\nand that essential nutrient, salt,\nthe three appetitive ones to ensure\nthat we maintain our electrolyte balance,\nbitter to prevent the ingestion\nof toxic nauseous chemicals,\nnearly all bitter tasting\nthings out in the wild are bad for you,\nand sour, most likely to prevent ingestion\nof spoil acid,\nfermented foods.\nAnd that's it.\nThat is the pallet that we deal with.\nNow, of course,\nthere's a difference between\nbasic taste and flavor,\nflavor is the whole experience.\nFlavor is the combination of\nmultiple tastes coming together\ntogether with smell, with\ntexture, with temperature,\nwith the look of it\nthat gives you what you\nand I would call the\nfull sensory experience.\nBut, but we scientists need to reduce\nthe problem into its basic elements.\nSo we can begin to break it apart\nbefore we put it back together.\nSo when we think about the sense of taste,\nand we try to figure out how\nthese lines of information\ngo from your tongue to your brain\nand how they signal and\nhow they could integrate it\nand how they trigger all\nthese different behaviors.\nWe look at them as individual qualities,\nso we give the animals sweet,\nor we give them a bitter.\nWe give them sour,\nwe avoid mixes because the first stage of\ndiscovery is to have that\nclarity as to what you're trying\nto extract so that you can\nhopefully meaningfully make\na difference by being able to figure out\nhow easy that A goes to B to C and to D,\ndoes this make sense?\n- Yeah, almost like the primary colors\nto create the full array\nof the color spectrum.\n- Exactly.\n- Before I ask you about the first\nand second and third stages of\ntaste and flavor perception,\nis there any idea that\nthere may be more than five?\n- There is, for example, what about fat?\n- I love the taste.\n- Oh, I love fat too.\nAnd I love the texture of fat,\nespecially if it's slightly burnt,\nlike in South America, when\nI visited Buenos Aries,\nI found that at the end of a\nmeal, they would take a steak,\nthe trimming off the edge of\nthe steak, burn it slightly,\nand then serve it back to me.\nAnd I thought that's disgusting.\nAnd then I tasted it and it's delightful.\n- It is.\n- There's nothing quite like it.\n- This goes back to this notion\nbefore that we like to live on the edge.\nAnd we like to do things\nthat we should not be doing, Andrew,\nbut on the other hand,\nlook at those muscles.\n- I don't suggest anyone eat pure fat.\nThe listeners of this\npodcast will immediately,\nI'm sure there'll be a YouTube video soon\nthat I like eating pure fat.\nI'm not on a ketogenic diet, et cetera,\nbut fat is tasty as evidenced by\nthe obesity problem that\nexists in this country.\n- We'll talk about that.\nYou know, in a little bit about\nthe gut brain axis,\nI think it'll be important to cover it\nbecause it's the other\nside of the taste system.\nAnd so missing taste, one is fat,\nalthough like you clearly\nhighlighted a lot of fat taste\nin quotation marks is really\nthe feeling of fat rolling on your tongue.\nAnd so there is a compelling argument\nthat a lot of what we call fat taste,\nit's really mechanosensory,\nit's somatosensory cells,\ncells that are not responding to taste,\nbut they're responding\nto mechanical stimulation\nof fat molecules rolling on the tongue\nthat gives you that perception of fat.\n- I love the idea that there\nis a perception of fat,\nregardless of whether or not\nthere's a dedicated receptor for fat,\nmostly because it's evoking sensations\nand imagery of the taste\nof slightly burnt fat.\n- For example.\nAnd another one you could\nargue is metallic taste.\nYou know, I know exactly\nwhat it tastes like.\nYou know, if you ask me to explain it,\nI will have a hard time,\nwhat are the palettes of that color\nthat can allow me to define it?\nIt wouldn't be easy,\nbut I know precisely what it tastes like,\ntake take a penny, put it in your mouth\nand you know what it tastes like.\n- Or blood.\n- Or blood.\nThat's another very good example.\nAnd is there really a receptor\nfor metallic taste or it's nothing\nbut this magical combination\nof the activation of the existing lines,\nthink of it as lines of information,\njust separate lines,\nlike the keys of a piano.\nSweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,\nyou play the key and you\nactivate a one chord.\nAnd that one chord in the case\nof a piano leads to a note,\nyou know a tune and in the case\nof taste leads to an\naction and a behavior,\nbut you play many of them together.\nAnd something emerges\nthat it's different than\nany one of the pieces.\nAnd it's possible that\nmetallic, for example,\nrepresents the combination\nof the activity just\nin the right ratio makes\nof these other lines.\n- Makes sense.\nAnd it actually provides a perfect,\nyour example of the piano provides\na perfect segue for what\nI'd like to touch on next,\nwhich is if you would\ndescribe the sequence\nof neural events leading to\na perceptual event of taste.\nAnd I'm certain that somewhere\nin there you'll embed\nan answer to the question of whether\nor not we indeed have\ndifferent taste receptors\ndistributed in different\nlocations on our tongue.\nOr elsewhere in the mouth.\n- Yes.\nSo let's start by the banking\nthat old tale and myth.\n- Who came up with that?\n- There are many views,\nbut the most prevalent is that\nthere was an original drawing\ndescribing the sensitivity\nof the tongue to different tastes.\nSo imagine I can take a Q-Tip,\nthis is a thought experiment,\nand I'm going to dip that\nQ-Tip in salt and in quinine\nas something bitter and\nglucose as something sweet.\nAnd I'm going to take that Q-tip,\nask you to stick your tongue out\nand start moving around\nyour tongue and ask you,\nwhat do you feel?\nAnd then I'm going to\nchange the concentration\nof the amount of salt or the\namount of bitter and ask,\ncan I get some sort of\na map of sensitivity\nto the different tastes?\nAnd the argument that\nhas emerged is that there\nis a good likelihood that the data\nwas simply mistranslated\nas it was being drawn.\nAnd of course, that led\nto an entire industry.\nThis is the way you maximize\nyour wine experience,\nbecause now we're going to form the vessel\nthat you're going to drink from\nso that it acts maximally on\nthe receptors which happen.\nNow, there is no tongue map.\nAll right, we have taste buds distributed\nin various parts of the tongue.\nSo there is a map on the\ndistribution of taste bud,\nbut each taste bud has around\na hundred taste receptor cells.\nAnd those taste receptor\ncells can be of five types,\nsweet, sour, bitter, salty, or umami.\nAnd for the most part,\nall taste buds have the representation\nof all five taste qualities.\nNow there's no question\nthat there is a slight bias\nfor some taste, like bitter,\nis particularly rich at the\nvery back of your tongue.\nAnd there is a teleological\nbasis for that,\nactually a biological basis for that.\nThat's the last line of defense\nbefore you swallow something bad.\nAnd so let's make sure that\nthe very back of your tongue\nhas plenty of these bad news receptors\nso that if they get activated,\nyou can trigger a gagging reflex\nand get rid of this that\notherwise may kill you.\n- Makes good sense.\n- But the notion that all sweet is\nin the front and salt is on the side.\nIt's not real.\nGo ahead.\n- Oh, I was just going\nto ask, first of all,\nthank you for dispelling that myth.\nAnd we will propagate\nthat information as\nfar and wide as we can.\n'Cause I think that's the number\none myth related to taste.\nThe other one is,\nare there taste receptors\nanywhere else in the mouth,\nfor instance, on the lips?\n- The palette, the palette, not the lips.\nSo it's in the pharynx at the\nvery back of the oral cavity,\nthe tongue and the palette and the palette\nis very rich in sweet receptors.\n- I'll have to pay attention to this\nthe next time I eat something sweet.\n- When you pull it up, yeah.\nNow the important thing is that\nafter the receptors for\nthese five, the detectors,\nthe molecules that send sweet,\nsour, bitter, salt, umami,\nthese are receptors,\nproteins found on the surface\nof taste receptor cells that\ninteract with these chemicals.\nAnd once they interact,\nthen they trigger the cascade\nof events, biochemical events,\ninside cell that now\nsends an electrical signal\nthat says there is sweet\nhere, or there is salt here.\nNow having these receptors\nand my laboratory identify\nthe receptors for all\nfive basic taste classes,\nsweet, bitter, salt, umami,\nand most recently sour.\nNow completing the palette.\nYou can now use these\nreceptors to really map\nwhere are they found in the\ntongue in a very rigorous way.\nThis is no longer about using a Q-Tip\nand trying to figure\nout what you're feeling,\nbut rather what you have in your tongue.\nThis is not a guess.\nThis is now a physical map that says\nthe sweet receptors are found here.\nThe bitter are found here.\nAnd when you do that,\nyou find that in fact,\nevery taste bud throughout\nyour oral cavity\nhas receptors for all of\nthe basic taste classes.\n- Amazing.\nAnd as it turns out,\nand I'm sure you'll tell us\nimportant in terms of thinking\nabout how the brain computes,\nencodes and decodes this\nthing we call taste.\nI'm going to inject a quick\nquestion that I'm sure is on\nmany people's minds before we get back\ninto the biological circuit,\nwhich is many people, including myself,\nare familiar with the\nexperience of drinking\na sip of tea or coffee that is too hot,\nand burning my tongue is\nthe way I would describe it.\n- Horrible.\n- Horrible.\nAnd then disrupting my sense of taste\nfor some period of time afterward.\nWhen I experienced that phenomenon,\nthat unfortunate phenomenon have\nI destroyed taste\nreceptors that regenerate,\nor have I somehow used temperature\nto distort the function of the circuit\nso that I no longer taste\nthe way I did before?\n- Excellent question.\nAnd the answer is both.\nIt turns out that your taste receptors\nonly live for around two\nweeks, and this, by the way,\nmakes sense because here you\nhave an organ, the tongue,\nthat is continuously exposed to everything\nyou could range from the nicest,\nto the most horrible possible things.\n- Use your imagination.\n- And so you need to make sure\nthat these cells are always coming back\nin a way that can reexperience the world\nin the right way and\nthere are other organs\nthat have the same underlying logic.\nYour gut, your intestines\nare the same way.\nAmazing.\nAgain, they're receiving\neverything that you ingest.\nGod forbid what's there, from the spiciest\nto the most horrible tastings\nor the most delicious.\nAnd again,\nthose intestinal cells\nwhose role is to ultimately\ntake all these nutrients and\nbring them into the body.\nAlso renew in a very, very fast cycle,\nolfactory neurons in\nyour nose is the example.\nSo then A, yes,\nyou're burning a lot of your\ncells and is over for those.\nThe good news is that\nthey're going to come back,\nbut we know that when you\nburn yourself with tea,\nthey come back within 20 minutes,\n30 minutes, an hour,\nand these cells are not\nrenewing in that timeframe.\nThey're not listening to your needs.\nThey have their own internal clock.\nAnd so you are really affecting,\nyou're damaging them in a\nway that they can recover.\nAnd then they come back\nand you also damage your\nsomatosensory cells.\nThese are the results that\nfeel things, not taste things.\nAnd then you wait half an hour or so,\nand then my goodness, thank\nGod, it's back to normal.\n- And most of the time,\nI don't even notice the\ntransition realizing,\nas you tell me, and I'll later,\nI'll ask you about the relationship\nbetween odor and taste.\nBut as a next step, along this circuit,\nlet's assume I ingest\nsome, let's keep it simple.\nA sweet taste.\n- Let's make it even simpler.\nBut at the same time,\nperhaps more informative,\nlet's compare and\ncontrast sweet and bitter\nas we follow their lines\nfrom the tongue to the brain.\nSo the first thing is that\nthe two evoke diametrically\nopposed behaviors.\nIf we have to come up with\ntwo sensory experience\nthat represent polar opposites,\nit will be sweet and video.\nThere are not two colors that\nrepresent polar opposites\nbecause you could say black and white,\nthey are polar opposites,\none detects only one thing.\nThe other one detects everything,\nbut they don't evoke different behaviors.\n- Even political parties\nhave some overlap.\n- Sweet and bitter are\nthe two opposite ends\nof the sensory spectrum,\nnow, a taste can be\ndefined by two features.\nAgain, I'm a reductionist,\nso I'm reducing it in a way that I think\nit's easier to follow the signal.\nAnd the two features are\nits quality and its valance\nand valance with a little V\nthat's what we say in Spanish, with a V,\nmeans the value of that experience, right?\nOr in this case of that\nstimuli and you take sweet,\nsweet has a quality, an identity,\nand that's what you and I will refer\nto as the taste of sweet.\nWe know exactly what it tastes like,\nBut sweet also has a positive valance,\nwhich makes it incredibly\nattractive and appetitive,\nbut it's attractive and appetitive,\nas I'll tell you in a second independent\nof its identity and quality.\nIn fact, we have been able\nto engineer animals where we completely\nremove the valance from the stimuli.\nSo these animals can taste sweet,\ncan recognize it as sweet,\nbut it's no longer attractive.\nIt's just one more chemical stimuli.\nAnd that's because the\nidentity and the valence\nare encoded in two separate\nparts of the brain.\nIn the case of bitter,\nagain, it has on the\none hand its identity,\nits quality, and you know\nexactly what bitter tastes like.\n- I can taste it now,\neven as you describe it.\n- But it also has a valence and that's\na negative valance because\nit evokes aversive behaviors.\nAre we on?\n- Absolutely.\nAnd it comes to mind.\nI remember telling some kids recently\nthat we're going to go get ice\ncream and it was interesting.\nThey looked up and they started smacking\ntheir like, they'll actually.\n- The anticipatory response.\nAbsolutely.\nWhen we talk about the gut\nbrain maybe we'll get there.\nSo then the signals, if we\nfollow now, these two lines,\nthey're really like two separate keys\nat the two ends of this keyboard.\nAnd you press one key and\nyou activate this cord.\nSo you activate the sweet cells\nthroughout your oral cavity.\nAnd they all converge into\na group of sweet neurons\nin the next station, which\nis still outside the brain,\nit's one of the taste ganglia.\nThese are the neurons\nthat innervate your tongue\nand the oral cavity.\n- Where do they sit approximately?\n- Around there.\n- Right here around there.\nThe lymph nodes, more or less?\n- You got it.\nAnd there are two main\nganglia that innervate\nthe vast majority of all\ntaste buds in the oral cavity.\nAnd then from there that sweet signal\ngoes onto the brain stem.\nThe brain stem is the entry\nof the body into the brain.\nAnd there are different\nareas of the brain stem.\nAnd there are different groups\nof neurons in the brain stem.\nAnd there's this unique area in a unique,\na topographically defined\nlocation in the rostral side\nof the brain that receives\nall of the taste input.\n- A very dense area of the brain.\n- A very rich area of the brain.\nExactly.\nAnd from there,\nthe sweet signal goes to this other area\nhigher up on the brain stem.\nAnd then it goes through\na number of stations where\nthat sweet signal goes from\nsweet neuron to sweet neuron,\nto sweet neuron, to\neventually get to your cortex.\nAnd once it gets to your taste cortex,\nthat's where meaning is\nimposed into that signal.\nIt's then, and only then this is what\nthe data suggests that now you\ncan identify this as a sweet stimuli.\n- [Andrew] And how quickly\ndoes that all happen?\n- You know, the time scale of\nthe nervous system it's fast.\n- So within less than a second.\n- [Charles] Yeah, absolutely.\n- I rarely mistake bitter for sweet.\nMaybe with respect to people\nand my own poor judgment,\nbut not with respect to taste.\n- And in fact,\nwe can demonstrate this\nbecause we can stick electrodes\nat each of these stations, conceptually,\nand we can stimulate the tongue,\nand then we can record\nthe signals pretty much\ntime log the stimulus delivery.\nYou deliver the stimuli and\nwithin a fraction of a second,\nyou see now the response\nin this following stations,\nnow it gets to the cortex,\nand now in there you impose\nmeaning to that taste.\nThere is an area of your\nbrain that represents\nthe taste of sweet in taste cortex\nand a different area that\nrepresents the taste of bitter.\nIn a sense, there is a topographic map\nof these taste qualities\ninside your brain.\nNow we're going to do\na thought experiment.\nNow, if this group of neurons\nin your cortex really represents\nthe sense of sweet and\nthis added different group\nof neurons in your brain\nrepresents the taste,\nthe perception of bitter,\nthen we should be able to do two things.\nFirst, I should be able\nto go into your brain,\nsomehow silence those neurons,\nfind a way to prevent\nthem from being activated.\nAnd I can give you all the sweet you want,\nand you'll never know\nthat you're tasting sweet.\nAnd conversely, I should be\nable to go into your brain,\ncome up with a way to\nactivate those neurons\nwhile I'm giving you absolutely nothing.\nAnd you're going to think\nthat you are getting\nthat full percept and that's\nprecisely what we have done.\nAnd that's precisely what you get.\nThis of course is in the brain of mice.\n- But presumably in humans\nit would work similarly.\n- Absolutely the same, zero doubt.\nI have no questions.\nSo this attests to two important things,\nthe first to the predetermined\nnature of the sense of taste,\nbecause it means I can go to these parts\nof your brain in the\nabsence of any stimuli.\nAnd have you throw the\nfull behavioral experience.\nIn fact, when we activate in your cortex,\nthese bitter neurons, the\nanimal can start gagging,\nbut it's drinking only water,\nbut the animal thinks that's\ngetting a bitter stimuli.\n[audience applauds] This is amazing.\n- And so, and the second,\njust to finish the line so\nthat it doesn't sound\nlike it teaches two things\nand then I only give you one lesson.\nIt is that it substantiates\nthis capacity of the brain to segregate,\nto separate in this nodes of action,\nthe representation of these\ntwo diametrically opposed percepts.\nWhich is sweet, for\nexample, versus bitter.\n- The reason I say amazing,\nand that is also amazing is the following,\nyou told us earlier, and\nyou're absolutely correct,\nof course, that the end of the day,\nwhether or not it's one\ngroup of neurons over here,\nand another group of neurons over there,\nwhich is the way it turns out to be,\nelectrical activity is the generic,\ncommon language of both sets of neurons.\nSo that raises the question for me,\nof whether or not those\nseparate sets of neurons\nare connected to areas of the brain\nthat create this sense\nof valence or whether\nor not they're simply\ncreated connected, excuse me,\nto sets of neurons that evoke\ndistinct behaviors of moving\ntowards and inhaling more\nand licking or aversive are\nwe essentially interpreting our behavior\nand our micro responses\nor are micro responses\nand our behaviors the\nconsequence of the percept?\n- Excellent, excellent question.\nSo first answer is they go into\nan area of the brain\nwhere valence is imposed,\nand that area is known as the\namygdala and the sweet neurons\ngo to a different area\nthan the bitter neurons.\nNow I want to do a thought experiment\nbecause I think your audience\nmight appreciate this.\nLet's say I activate this group of neurons\nand the animal increases licking\nand I'm activating the sweet neurons.\nAnd so that's expected\nbecause now it's tasting\nthis water as if it was sugar.\nNow this Moses transforming\nwater into wine\nin this case we're going\nto, and today's Passover,\nso this is an appropriate example,\nwe're transforming it into sweet.\nBut how do I know that\nactivating them is evoking\na positive feeling inside,\na goodness, a satisfaction,\nor I love it versus I'm\njust increasing licking,\nwhich is the other option,\nbecause all we're seeing is\nthat the animal is leaking more.\nAnd we're trying to infer that that means\nthat he's feeling something\nreally good versus you know what,\nthat piano line is going back\nstraight into the tongue.\nAnd all it's doing is\nforcing it to move faster.\nWell, we can actually separate this\nby doing experiments that allows\nto fundamentally distinguish them\nand imagine the following experiment,\nI'm going to take the\nanimal and I'm going to\nput them inside a box that has two sides.\nAnd the two sides have features\nthat make him different.\nOne has yellow little toys.\nThe other one has green toys.\nOne has little black stripes.\nThe other one has blue stripes.\nSo the animal can tell the\ntwo halves, I take the mouse,\nput them inside this\narena, this play arena.\nAnd it will explore and potter\naround both sides with equal frequency.\nAnd now what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to activate these neurons,\nthese sweet neurons,\nevery time the animal\nis on the side with the yellow stripes.\nAnd if that is creating a\npositive internal state,\nwhat would the animal now want to do?\nIt will want to stay on the\nside with the yellow stripes.\nThere's no licking here.\nThe animal is not extending its tongue\nevery time I'm activating this neurons.\nThis is known as a place preference test.\nAnd it's generally used,\nit's just one form of many\ndifferent tests to demonstrate\nthat the activation of a group\nof neurons in the brain is imposing,\nfor example, a positive\nversus a negative valance.\nWhereas if I do the same thing\nby activating the bitter neurons,\nthe animal will actively\nwant now to stay away\nfrom the side where these\nneurons are being activated.\n- And that's precisely what you see.\n- [Charles] And that's\nprecisely what we see.\n- Many people, including myself,\nare familiar with the experience\nof going to a restaurant,\neating a variety of foods.\nAnd then fortunately\ndoesn't happen that often,\nbut then feeling very sick.\nI learned coming up in neuroscience\nthat this is one strong\nexample of one trial learning,\nthat from that point on,\nit's not the restaurant\nor the waitress or waiter,\nor the date,\nbut it's my notion of it\nhad to have been the shrimp\nthat leads me to then want to\navoid shrimp in every context,\nmaybe even shrimp powder.\n- You got it.\n- For a very long time.\nI can imagine all the evolutionarily\nadaptive reasons why this\nsuch a phenomenon would exist.\nDo we have any concept of where\nin this pathway it exists?\n- We do, we know actually\na significant amount\nat a general level.\nIn fact, more than shrimp,\noysters are even a more dramatic example,\none bad oyster is all\nyou need to be driven\nthat way for the next six months.\n- I think because the\ntexture alone is something\nthat one learns to overcome.\nI actually really enjoy oysters.\nI despise mussels, despise\nshrimp, not the animal,\nbut the taste and yet\noysters, for some reason,\nI've yet to have a bad experience.\n- It's like, uni, by the way\ntexture is hard to get\nover, but once you get over,\nit's delicious.\n- That's what they tell me.\nWe were both in San Diego at one point,\nand I'll give a plug to Sushi Ota,\nis kind of the famous place,\nand they have amazing uni\nand I've tried it twice.\nAnd I'm oh for two.\nIt somehow the texture outweighs\nany kind of the deliciousness\nthat people report.\n- It's a very acquired taste.\nIt's like beer, I grew up in Chile,\nthat's where the accent comes\nfrom in case anyone wonder.\nAnd by the time I came\nhere to graduate school,\nI was 19, too old to overcome\nmy heavy Chilian accent.\nSo here I am, 40 years, 50 years late,\nnot quite 40 plus-\n- We appreciate it.\n- And I still sound like\nI just came off the boat.\nSo in Chile, you don't drink\nbeer when you're young,\nyou drink wine.\nChili's a huge wine producer.\nSo when I came to the US,\nall of my classmates were\ndrinking beer because\nthey had finished college\nwhere they were all\nyou're drinking and graduate school,\nyou're working 18 hours a day every day,\nthe way they relax, let's\ngo and have some beers.\n- And beer is cheaper.\n- And beer is cheap,\nand we were being clearly\nunderpaid may I add.\nI couldn't do it.\nIt's an acquired taste.\nIt was too late by then.\nAnd here I am 60 plus.\nAnd if you take all the beer\nI've drank in my entire life,\nI would say they add to less than\nan eight ounce glass of water.\n- Impressive.\nWell, your health is\nprobably better for it.\n- I'm not sure.\n- Your physical health anyway.\n- So it goes back to acquired taste.\nThis is the connection\nto uni and to oysters.\nNow, going back to the one trial learning\nthis is the great thing about our brains,\ncertain things we need to repeat\na hundred times to learn\nthem, hello operator.\nCan I have the phone number\nfor sushi Ota, please?\nAnd then she'll give it\nto you over the phone,\nat least in the old days.\nAnd then you need to\nrepeat it to yourself over\nand over and over, over the next minute.\nSo you can dial sushi Ota,\nand five minutes later, it's gone.\nThat's what we call working memory.\nThen there is the short term memory.\nWe park our car.\nAnd if we're lucky, by the end of the day,\nwe remember where it is.\nAnd then there is the long term memory.\nWe remember the birthdays of every one\nof our children for the rest of our lives.\nWell, there are events that a\nsingle event is so traumatic\nthat it activates the circuits in a way\nthat it's a one trial learning.\nAnd the taste system is literally\nat the top of that food chain.\nAnd there is a phenomenon known\nas conditioned taste aversion.\nYou can pair an attractive\nstimuli with a really bad one,\nand you can make an animal begin\nto vehemently dislike for example, sugar.\nAnd that's because you've\nconditioned the animals\nto now be averse to these\notherwise nice taste\nbecause it's been associated with malaise.\nAnd when you do that,\nnow you could begin to ask\nwhy has change in the signal\nas it travels from the tongue\nto the brain in a normal animal\nversus an animal where you\nhave now transformed sweet\nfrom being attractive to being immersive.\nAnd this is the way now\nyou begin to explore\nhow the brain changes,\nthe nature, the quality,\nthe meaning of a stimuli\nas a function of its state.\n- I have a number of\nquestions related to that,\nall of which relate to\nthis idea of context,\nbecause you mentioned before\nthat flavor is distinct\nfrom taste because flavor involves smell,\ntexture, temperature,\nand some other features,\nuni, sea urchin being a good example of,\nI can sense the texture.\nIt actually it's, nah, I won't describe\nwhat it reminds me of,\nfor various reasons.\nThe ability to place context into,\nto insert context into a perception,\nor rather to insert a perception\ninto context is so powerful.\nAnd there's an element of\nkind of mystery about it.\nBut if we start to think\nabout some of the more nuance\nthat we like to live at\nthe edge, as you say,\nhow many different\ntastes on the taste dial\nto go back to your analogy\nearlier, the color dial,\ndo you think that there\ncould be for something\nas fixed as bitter, so for instance,\nI don't think I like bitter taste,\nbut I like some fermented foods\nthat seem to have a little\nbit of sour and have a little bit\nof that briny flavor.\nHow much plasticity do\nyou think there is there\nand in particular across the lifespan,\nbecause I think one of\nthe most salient examples\nof this is that kids don't seem\nto like certain vegetables,\nbut they all are hardwired\nto like sweet tastes.\nAnd yet you could also imagine\nthat one of the reasons\nwhy they may eventually grow\nto incorporate vegetables is\nbecause of some knowledge\nthat vegetables might be-\n- Good for you.\n- Better for them.\nSo is there a change in the\nreceptors, the distribution,\nthe number, the sensitivity, et cetera,\nthat can explain the transition\nfrom wanting to avoid vegetables,\nto being willing to eat vegetables\nsimply in childhood to early development.\nYes, so I going to take the\nquestion slightly differently,\nbut I think it would illustrate the point.\nAnd I want to just\nuse the difference between\nthe olfactory system\nand the taste system to make the point,\ntaste system five basic pallets,\nsweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,\neach of them has a predetermined identity.\nWe know exactly what and valence.\nThese are attractive.\nThese are aversive.\nIn the olfactory system,\nit's claimed that we can smell millions\nof different odors, yet for the most part,\nnone of them have an innate\npredetermined meaning,\nin olfactory system,\nmeaning is imposed by\nlearning and experience.\n- Even the smell of smoke?\n- So I'm going to give you,\nI'm going to make it differently.\nThey are a handful of the millions\nof odors that were claimed that,\nthat you could immediately tell me these\nare adversive and these are attractive.\n- Vomit.\n- So vomit, it's not correct\nbecause I can assure you that they're\ncultures and societies where\nthings which are far less\nappealing than vomit do not\nevoke a adverse reaction.\n- Really?\n- Really, sulfur would\nbe maybe a universal.\nI'm not talking pheromones.\npheromones are in a different category\nthat trigger innate responses,\nbut nearly every other is afforded meaning\nby learning and experience.\nAnd that's why you like broccoli.\nAnd I despise broccoli because I remember\nmy mother forcing me to eat broccoli.\n[audience applauds] I'm so sorry.\n- Same sensory experience.\nThis accommodates two important things.\nIn the case of taste,\nyou have neurons at every\nstation that are for sweet,\nfor sour, for bitter,\nfor salty, and umami,\nit's only five classes.\nSo it's not going to\ntake a lot of your brain.\nIf we can, in fact,\nsmell a million others,\nand everyone else of others\nhad to have predetermined,\nmeaning there's not\ngoing to be enough brain\njust to accommodate that one sense.\nAnd so evolution in its infinite wisdom,\nevolved a system where you put together\na pathway and a cortex, olfactory cortex,\nwhere you have the capacity\nto associate every other\nin a specific context that\nnow gives it the meaning.\nNow let's go back to the\noriginal question then.\nSo other than clearly\nplastic, mega plastic,\nbecause it's fundamental\nbasis and neural organization,\nbut taste,\nwe just told you that\npredetermined, hardwired,\nbut predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean\nthat it's not modulated\nby learning or experience.\nIt only means that you\nare born liking sweet\nand disliking bitter.\nAnd we have many examples of plasticity,\nbeer being one example.\nSo why do we learn to\nlove beer and coffee.\nIt's because it has an\nassociated gain to the system\nand that gain to the system,\nthat positive valance\nthat emerges out of that negative signal\nis sufficient to create\nthat positive association.\nAnd in the case of beer,\nof course, it's alcohol.\nThe feeling good that we get after\nis more than sufficient to say,\nI want to have more of this.\nAnd in the case of coffee, of course,\nis caffeine activating a whole\ngroup of neurotransmitter\nsystems that give you that\nhigh associated with coffee.\nSo yes, this taste system is changeable.\nIt's malleable, and it's subject subjected\nto learning and experience.\nBut I like the olfactory\nsystem is restricted\nin what you could do with it\nbecause its goal is to allow you\nto get nutrients and survive.\nThe goal of the olfactory\nsystem is very different.\nIt's being used, not in our case,\nbut in every animal species\nto identify friend versus foe,\nto identify mate,\nto identify ecological\nniches they want to be in.\nSo it plays a very broad\nrole that then requires\nthat it be set up organized\nand function in a very\ndifferent type of context.\nTaste is about, can we get the\nnutrients we need to survive?\nAnd can we ensure that we are\nattracted to the ones we need?\nAnd we adverse to the ones\nthat are going to kill us,\nI'm being overly simplistic\nand reductionist.\nBut I think it illustrates\nthe huge difference\nbetween these two chemo sensory systems.\n- I don't think you're\nbeing overly simplicity.\nI think it illustrates\nthe key intractable nature of this system\nand the way you've approached it.\nAnd I think it's important\nfor people to hear that,\nbecause everybody,\nas we are as mystified with\nempathy and love, et cetera.\nSo in a fairness to that,\nI'm going to ask a sort of\na high level question\nor abstract question.\nThis was based on a conversation I had\nwith a former girlfriend\nwhere we were talking about\nchemistry between individuals.\nVery complicated topic on the one hand.\nBut on the other hand, quite\nsimple in that certain people,\nfor whatever reason, evoke a\ntremendous sense of arousal,\nfor lack of a better\nword, between two people,\none would hope,\nat least for some period of time.\n- I didn't know this was\nthat kind of a podcast.\n- No, well, the reason I,\nbut this has to do with taste\nbecause she said something,\nI think in part to\nmaybe irritate me a bit,\nbut we were commenting not\nabout our own experience of each other,\nbut of someone that she\nwas now very excited\nabout we're on good terms.\nAnd she said, \"What do you think it is,\nthis thing of chemistry?\"\nSo maybe she was trying to-\n- Warn you of what's coming.\n- Warn me what's coming.\nAnd she said,\n\"I have a feeling something\nabout it is in smell\nand something about it\nis actually in taste,\nliterally the taste of somebody's breath.\"\nThat's the way she described it.\nAnd I thought that it was\na very interesting example\nfor a number of reasons,\nbut in particular,\nbecause it gets to the\nmerging of odor and taste.\nBut also to the idea that\nof course the context\nof a new relationship, I'm\nassuming that, and in fact,\nthey're both attractive people, et cetera.\nThere's a whole context there,\nbut I've had the experience of the odor\nof somebody's breath being aversive.\nNot because I could\nidentify it as aversive.\n- Because you just didn't like it.\n- But because I just didn't like it.\n- But that's because you associated\nwith added odors that trigger\nthat negative aversive\nreaction, by the way.\n- Absolutely.\nThere are certain perfumes\nto me that are aversive.\n- [Charles] You got it.\n- And there are other sense,\nI can recall a sense of skin, of foods,\net cetera, that are immensely appetitive.\nSo I've experienced both\nsides of this equation myself.\nAnd she was describing this\nand to me more than tasting wine,\nwhich is the typical example\nwhere people inhale it and\nthen they drink it, to me,\nthis seems like something\nthat more people might\nbe able to relate to,\nthat certain things and\npeople smell delicious.\nEven mothers describing the\nsmell of their baby's head.\n- A mother, or us.\n- [Andrew] Of course, men too, yeah.\n- I mean our own babies\nwhen in their necks,\nthat's the magical place.\n- Their neck.\n- The back of their neck.\n- There you go.\n- Oh my goodness.\nI have a grandchild now.\nSo I know exactly what, Rio,\nthat's his name, smells like.\n- Okay.\nSo more beautiful examples.\nIt's always more fun to think\nabout the beautiful positively\nappetitive examples.\nThe smell of the back\nof your grandson's neck.\nI mean, you could get\nmore specific than that,\nbut not a lot more specific exactly.\nSo what is going on in terms\nof the combination of odor\nand taste given that these\ntwo systems are so different?\n- Yes, and they come together,\nultimately there is a place\nin the brain where they come\ntogether to integrate the two into\nwhat we would call that\nsensory experience.\nAnd I'll tell you an experiment\nthat you could do that demonstrates this.\nI think it's good for the,\nfor your audience here to get\na sense of how we approach\nthese problems so that we can get\nin a meaningful scientific answers.\nSo we know where the olfactory\ncortex is in the brain.\nWe know where the taste\ncortex is in the brain.\nThey're in two different places.\nWe can go to each of these two, cortexes,\nput color traces, we put green in one,\nwe put red in the other and\nwe see where the colors go to.\nThat's a reflection of where\nthose neurons are projecting\ninto their next targets.\nOnce they get the signal, where\ndo they send the signal to?\nAnd then we reason that if odor\nand taste come together\nsomewhere in the brain,\nwe should find an area that now\nit's getting red and green color.\nAnd we found such an area.\nAnd next we anticipated,\nwe hypothesized that\nmaybe this is the area\nin the brain of the mouse,\ncorresponding area in the brain of humans,\nthat integrates odor and taste.\nIt's known as,\nthe term normally used is\nmultisensory integration.\nAnd if this is true, we could\ndo the following experiment.\nWe can train a mouse\nto lick sweet.\nAnd if they guess correctly,\nthat that is supposed to be sweet.\nThey should go now to the\nright port, to the right side,\nto get a water reward.\nIf they go to the lift, when it was sweet,\nthen they're incorrect\nand they get no reward\nand they actually get a time out.\nNow the mice are thirsty,\nso they're very motivated to perform.\nAnd if you repeat this\ntask a hundred times,\na hundred trials, incredibly enough,\nthis animal learned to recognize the sweet\nand execute the right action.\nAnd by their action,\nwe now are being told what\nthat animal is tasting.\nWe can make it more interesting\nand we can give him\nsweet and bitter and say,\nif it's sweet go to the right\nand if it's bitter go to the left.\nAnd after you train him\nthis mice with 90% accuracy,\nit'll tell you, when you\nrandomize now the stimuli,\nwhat was sweet and what was bitter?\nWe can now do the same experiment,\nbut now mix taste with odor and say,\nif you got odor alone,\ngo to the right or push\nthis lever in mice.\nIf you get taste alone,\ngo to this other part or\npush this other lever.\nAnd if you get the two together,\ndo this something else.\nAnd if you train the mice,\nthe mice are able now to\nreport back to you when it's\nsensing taste alone,\nodor alone, or the mix.\nMakes sense?\n- Makes sense.\n- Now we can go to the\nbrain of this mice and go\nto this area that we now uncover,\ndiscover as being the side\nof multisensory integration\nbetween taste and odor, and silence it,\nprevent it from being\nactivated experimentally.\nAnd if that area really represented\nthe integration of these two,\nthe animals should still be able\nto recognize the taste alone.\nThey still should be able to\nrecognize the other alone,\nbut should be incapable\nnow to recognize the mix,\nand exactly as predicted.\nThat's exactly what you get.\nAll right?\n- The brain is basically\na series of engineered circuits, complex.\n- You got it.\nAnd our task is to figure\nout how can we extract\nthis amazing architecture\nof these circuits\nin a way that we can begin to uncover\nthe mysteries of the brain.\n- And why certain people's\nbreath tastes so good\nand other people's not so good.\n- Exactly.\nSo I never answered that,\nbut I told you how we can figure out\nwhere in the brain it's happening.\n- As we've been having this discussion,\nI thought a few times about similarities\nto the visual system or\ndifferences to the visual system,\nthe visual system,\nthere are a couple of\nphenomenon that I wonder\nif they also exist in the taste system,\nand the visual system\nwe know for instance,\nthat if you look at something long enough\nand activate the given\nreceptors long enough,\nthat object will actually disappear.\nWe offset this with little\nmicro eye movements,\net cetera, but the principle\nis a fundamental one.\nThis habituation or desensitization,\neveryone seems to call\nit something different,\nbut you get the idea of course,\nin the taste system,\nI'm certainly familiar\nwith eating something very,\nvery sweet for the first\ntime in a long time.\nAnd it feel tastes very\nsweet, but a few more licks,\na few more bites,\nand now it tastes not as\nsweet, with olfaction,\nI'm familiar with the odor\nin a room I don't like,\nor I like, and then it disappearing.\nSo similar phenomena,\nwhere does that occur?\nAnd can you imagine a sort of a system\nby which people could leverage that?\nBecause I do think that\nmost people are interested\nin eating, not more sugar, but less sugar.\n- I think we have better\nways to approach that.\nAnd we can transition from\ntaste into these other circuits\nthat makes sugar so extraordinarily\nimpossible not to consume.\n- Impossible, exactly.\n- So where does the desensitizing happen.\nThat's the term that we use, and it's,\nI think happening at multiple stations,\nit's happening at the receptor level.\nI.e. the salt in your tongue\nthat are sensing the sugar,\nas you activate this receptor\nand it's triggering activity\nafter activity after activity,\neventually you exhaust the receptor again,\nI'm using terms which are\nextraordinarily loose.\n- But for sake of this discussion.\n- For the sake of this\ndiscussion the receptor\ngets to a point where he\nundergoes a set of changes,\nchemical changes, where it now\nsignals far less efficiently,\nor it even gets removed from\nthe surface of the cell.\nAnd now what will happen\nis that the same amount\nof sugar will trigger\nfar less of a response.\nAnd that is a huge side\nof this modulation.\nAnd then the next, I believe\nis the integrated again,\nloss of signaling that happens\nby continuous activation\nof the circuit at each of these\ndifferent neural stations.\nYou know, there is from\nthe tongue to the ganglia,\nfrom the ganglia to the first station\nin the brain stem, a second\nstation in the brain stem,\nto the thalamus, then to the cortex.\nSo there are multiple steps\nthat this signal is traveling.\nNow, you might say why,\nif this is a label line,\nwhy do you need to have so many stations?\nAnd that's because the taste\nsystem is so important to\nensure that you get what\nyou need to survive,\nthat it has to be subjected\nto modulation by the internal state.\nAnd each of these nodes\nprovides a new site\nto give it plasticity and modulation,\nnot necessarily to change the\nway that something tastes,\nbut to ensure that you consume more\nor less or differently of what you need.\nI'm going to give you one example\nof how the internal state changes\nthe way the taste system works.\nSalt is very appetitive\nat low concentrations.\nAnd that's because we need it.\nIt's our electro lite\nbalance requires salt.\nEvery one of our neurons uses salt\nas the most important of the ions\nwith potassium to ensure\nthat you can transfer\nthese electrical signals\nwithin and between neurons,\nbut at high concentrations,\nlet's say ocean water,\nit's incredibly aversive.\nAnd we all know this because\nwe are going to the ocean.\nAnd then when you get it in\nyour mouth, it's not that great.\nHowever, if I salt deprive\nyou, and we can do this\nin experimental models quite readily,\nnow this incredibly high\nconcentration of salt,\none molar sodium chloride becomes\namazingly appetitive and attractive.\nWhat's going on in here.\nYour tongue is telling\nyou, this is horrible,\nbut your brain is telling\nyou, I don't care.\nYou need it.\nAnd this is what we call the modulation\nof the taste system by the internal state.\n- And presumably if one is hungry enough,\neven uni will taste good.\nJust hit you hit it right on the money.\nNo, no, this is exactly correct.\nOr if you're thirsty and hungry,\nyou suppress hunger so that you don't\nwaste water molecules in digesting food.\nWhy?\nBecause if you're thirsty\nand you have no water,\nyou will die within a week or so,\nbut you can on a hunger strike as long\nas you have water for months,\nbecause you're going to eat\nup all your energy reserves.\nWater is a different story.\nSo you could see,\nor that there are multiple layers\nat which the taste system that guides\nour drive and our motivation to consume\nthe nutrients we need has to be modulated\nin response to the internal state.\nAnd of course,\ninternal state itself has\nto be modulated by the external world.\nAnd so that I think is a reason\nwhy, what could otherwise,\nwould've been an incredibly simple system\nfrom the tongue to the\ncortex in one just wire.\nIt's not, because you have to ensure\nthat each step you give the system\nthat level of flexibility\nor what we call in\nneuroscience, plasticity.\n- I think we're headed into the gut.\nBut I have a question that has just been\non my mind for a bit now,\nbecause I was drinking this water\nand it has essentially no taste.\nIs there any kind of signal for\nthe absence of taste despite\nhaving something in the\nmouth and here is why I ask,\nwhat I'm thinking about is saliva.\nAnd while it's true that if\nI eat a lot of very highly\npalatable foods that does change\nhow I experience more bland foods,\nI must confess when I eat a\nlot of these highly processed\nfoods I don't particularly like them.\nI tend to crave healthier foods,\nbut that's probably for contextual\nreasons about nutrients,\net cetera.\nBut I could imagine an experiment where-\n- You see a taste of no taste.\n- Right, is there a taste of no taste,\nbecause in the visual system there is.\nYou close the eyes and you\nstart getting increases in\nactivity in the visual system,\nas opposed to decreases,\nwhich often surprises people.\nBut there are reasons for that\nbecause everything is about\nsignal to noise, signal to background.\n- It's a good question.\nI can tell you that most of\nour work is trying to focus on\nhow the taste system works,\nnot how it doesn't work well,\nbut you know.\n- Yeah, I know you're being playful.\nAnd I knew when inviting you here today,\nI was setting myself up for,\nactually on a different-\n- We're trying to learn things.\n- Yeah, I know.\n- However-\n- All right, listen, I was\nweaned in this system of a,\nand I'll say it here for the second.\nActually I recorded a podcast\nrecently with a very prominent\npodcast with Lex Friedman Podcast.\nAnd I made reference to the so-called\nNew York neuroscience mafia.\nI won't say whether or not we\nare sitting in the presence of\nthe New York neuroscience\nmafia member, but in any event,\nI know the sorts of ribbing\nthat they provide for those listening,\nthis is the kind of hazing that happens.\nBenevolent hazing in academia.\nI'm the target.\n- Of course, it's-\n- It's a sign of love.\n- Exactly.\n- He's going to tell me that.\n- And it's always about the\nscience in the end, right.\nBut it's an interesting question.\nLook, I am,\nI don't know the answer\nand I don't even know how\nI would explore it in a way\nthat it will rigorously teach me, eh, but.\n- Let me tell you why I'm asking.\nAnd then I'll offer an experiment\nthat I'd love to see\nsomeone here in the lab do.\nI'm thinking about saliva.\n- No, no, no, but that we know,\nthat we can figure it out.\n- Obviously.\nBut the question is whether or\nnot the saliva in a fed state\nis distinct from the\nsaliva in an unfed state,\nsuch that it modulates the\nsensitivity, the response.\n- It's not the sensitivity,\nthe experiment has been done.\n- [Andrew] It has been done.\nAnd so the answer is no.\n- It's not.\nAnd the way you could do the experiment is\nbecause we use artificial saliva.\n- There's such a thing?\nI know there's artificial tears, but.\n- No, no, we,\nI don't mean that you go to\nWalgreens that you get, I mean,\nwe, in my laboratory,\nwe know the composition of saliva\nand so you can make such a thing,\nand you can take taste cells in culture\nor in a tongue where you wash it out,\nand then you can apply artificial saliva.\nAnd what happens is that the system\nis being engineered to desensitize,\nto become agnostic for\nsaliva to become invisible.\nAnd there is no difference\non the state of the animal.\n- Great, well, this is the\nreason to do experiments.\n- [Charles] Yeah, absolutely.\n- So it doesn't defeat\nany grand hypothesis.\nIt's just a pure curiosity.\n- You know that curiosity kills the cat?\n- I do,\nbut saves the career of a\nscientists every single time.\n- That's what drives us, absolutely.\n- Every single time.\n- It's the story of our lives.\n- Exactly.\nSo if it's not saliva\nand apparently it is not,\nwhat about internal state\nand what aspects of this,\nthe internal milieu are relevant\nbecause there's autonomic,\nthere's a sleep and awake, there's stress.\nOne of the questions that\nI got from hundreds of people\nwhen I solicited questions in\nadvance of this episode was why do\nI crave sugar when I'm\nstressed, for instance,\nand that could be contextual,\nbut what are the basic elements-\n- Because it makes us\nfeel good by the way,\nwe'll get to that.\nThat's his answer.\n- Soothing.\n- It activates,\nwhat I'm going to generically\nrefer to as reward pleasure\ncenters in a way that it dramatically,\nchanges our internal state.\nThis is in why do we\neat a gallon ice cream\nwhen we're very depressed?\nIn fact, this is a good segue to go\ninto this an entire different world\nof the body telling your brain\nwhat you need in important\nthings like sugar and fat,\nbut anyways, go ahead, you\nwere going to ask something.\n- Well, no, I would like to discuss\nthe most basic elements of\ninternal state in particular,\nthe ones that are below\nour conscious detection.\nAnd this is a,\nof course is a segue into\nthis incredible landscape,\nwhich is the gut brain axis,\nwhich I think 15 years ago was almost a,\nmaybe it was posters at a meeting.\nAnd then now I believe you and others,\nthere are companies, there have companies,\nthere are active research programs,\nand beautiful work.\nMaybe you could describe some of that work\nthat you and others have been involved in.\nAnd a lot of the listeners of\nthis podcast will have heard\nof the gut brain axis.\nAnd there are a lot of misconceptions\nabout the gut brain axis.\nMany people think that this\nmeans that we think with our\nstomach because of the quote\nunquote, gut feeling aspect,\nbut I'd love for you to talk\nabout the aspects of gut brain\nsignaling that drive or\nchange our perceptions\nand behaviors that are\ncompletely beneath our awareness.\n- Yes. Excellent.\nSo let me begin maybe by stating that,\nthe brain needs to monitor\nthe state of every one of our organs,\nit has to do it.\nThis is the only way that the\nbrain can ensure that every\none of those organs are working\ntogether in a way that we\nhave healthy physiology.\nNow,\nthis monitoring of the brain\nhas been known for a long time,\nbut I think what hadn't been\nfully appreciated that this is\na two-way highway where the\nbrain is not only monitoring,\nbut is now modulating back\nwhat the body needs to do.\nAnd that includes all the way\nfrom monitoring the frequency\nof heartbeats and the way that\ninspiration and aspirations\nin the breeding cycle operate\nto what happens when you\ningest sugar and fat.\nNow, let me give you an example again,\nof how the brain can take\nwhat we would refer to contextual\nassociations and transform\nit into incredible changes\nin physiology and metabolism.\nRemember Pavlov?\nSo Pavlov in his classical\nexperiments in conditioning,\nassociative conditioning,\nhe would take a bell,\nhe would ring the bell every time\nhe was going to feed the dog.\nAnd eventually the dog\nlearned to associate\nthe ringing of the bell with food coming.\nNow, the first incredible finding\nhe made is the fact that the dog now\nin the presence of the bell alone\nwill start to salivate.\nAnd we will call that\nneurologically speaking\nan anticipatory response.\nOkay, I could understand it.\nI get it.\nYou know, neurons in the brain that form\nthat association now\nrepresent food is coming.\nAnd they're sending a signal\nto motor neurons to go into\nyour salivary glands to squeeze them.\nSo you release saliva because\nyou know food is coming,\nbut what's even more remarkable\nis that those animals are\nalso releasing insulin\nin response to a bell.\nOkay.\nThis illustrates one part\nof this two-way highway,\nthe highway going down,\nsomehow the brain created these\nassociations and there are\nneurons in your brain now that\nno food is coming and send a\nsignal somehow all the way down\nto your pancreas that now it\nsays release insulin because\nsugar is coming down.\nThis goes back to the magic of the brain.\nIt's a never ending source\nof both joy and intrigue.\nHow the hell do they do this?\nI mean, the neurons.\n- I share your delight and fascination.\nThere's not a day or a lecture\nor some talks are better than\nothers or talk where I don't\nsit back and just think,\nit's absolutely amazing.\n- How.\n- It's amazing.\n- Now over the past, I don't know,\ndozen years it and with great force\nover the last five years\nnow, the main highway\nthat is communicating\nthe state of the body with the brain,\nit has been uncovered as being\nwhat we now refer to\nas the gut brain axis.\nAnd the highway is a\nspecific bundle of nerves\nwhich emerged from the Vagal\nganglia, the nodus ganglia.\nAnd so it's the vagus\nnerve that is innervating\nthe majority of the organs in your body.\nIt's monitoring their function,\nsending a signal to the brain.\nAnd now the brain going\nback down and saying,\nthis is going alright, do this,\nor this is not going too well, do that.\n- And I should point out as\nyou well know, every organ,\nspleen, pancreas, lung.\n- They all must be monitored.\nIn fact I now,\nI have no doubt that the\ndiseases that we have normally\nassociated with metabolism, physiology,\nand even immunity are likely\nto emerge as diseases,\nconditions, states of the brain.\nI don't think obesity is\na disease of metabolism.\nI believe obesity is a\ndisease of brain circuits.\n- [Andrew] I do as well.\n- And so this view that we have,\nbeen working on for the\nlongest time, because,\nthe molecules that we're\ndealing with are in the body,\nnot in the head, led us to to view,\nof course this issues and\nproblems has been one of\nmetabolism, physiology, and so forth.\nThey remain to be the carriers\nof the ultimate signal,\nbut the brain ultimately appears\nto be the conductor of this\norchestra of physiology and metabolism.\nAll right, now let's go to\nthe gut brain and sugar,\nmaybe.\n- Please, please.\nNo, I mean,\nthe vagus nerve has in popular\nculture has been kind of\nconverted into this single\nmeaning of calming pathways,\nmostly because I actually\nhave to tip my hat\nto the yogic community was\namong the first to talk\nabout vagus on and on and on,\nthere are calming pathways,\nso-called parasympathetic\npathways within the vagus.\nBut I think that the more\nwe learn about the vagus,\nthe more it seems like an entire\nset of neural connections,\nas opposed to one nerve.\nI just wanted to just\nmention that because I think\na lot of people have heard\nabout the vagus turns out experimentally\nin the laboratory,\nmany neuroscientists\nwill stimulate the vagus\nto create states of alertness\nand arousal when animals,\nor even people believe it\nor not are close to dying\nor going into coma stimulation\nof the vagus is one of the ways\nto wake up the brain counter to the idea\nthat it's just this I way\nof calming oneself down.\n- And also of course, I mean,\none has to be cautious they're in that.\nSo the vagus nerve is made\nout of many thousands of fibers,\nindividual fibers that\nmake this gigantic bundle.\nAnd it's likely as we're speaking,\nthat each of these fibers carries\na slightly different meaning,\nnot necessarily one by\none, maybe five is 10,\nfive is 20, do all right,\nbut they carry meaning that's associated\nwith their specific task.\nThis group of fibers is telling the brain\nabout the state of your heart.\nThis group of fiber is telling\nthe brain about the state of your gut.\nThis is telling your brain\nabout its nutritional state,\nthis, your pancreas, this your lungs.\nAnd they are again, to make\nthe same simple example,\nthe keys of this piano.\nYes, you're right.\nThere is a lot of data,\nshowing that activating the\nentire vagal bundle has very\nmeaningful effects in a\nwide range of conditions.\nIn fact, it's being used to\ntreat untractable depression.\n- A little stimulator.\n- Epileptics seizures.\nBut again, there are thousands\nof fibers carrying different functions.\nSo to some degree this is like\nturning the lights on the stadium,\nbecause you need to illuminate\nwhere you lost your keys under your seat.\nYet 10,000 bulbs of a thousand\nWatts each have just come on.\nOnly one of this is pointing to where,\nand so I'm lucky enough that one\nof them happened to point to my side.\nSo here you activate the\nbundle thousands of fibers.\nI'm lucky enough that some of\nthose happen to do something,\nto make a meaningful\ndifference in depression,\nor to make a meaningful\ndifference in epileptics.\nBut it should not be misconstrued\nas arguing that this broad activation\nhas any type of\nselectivity or specificity,\nwe're just lucky enough\nthat among all the things\nthat are being done, some\nof those happen to change\nthe biology of these processes.\nNow, the reason this is relevant\nbecause the magic of this gut brain axis\nis the fact that you have these thousands\nof fibers really doing different\nfunctions and our goal.\nAnd along with many\nother great scientists,\nincluding Steve Lieder Lee,\nthat started a lot of\nthis molecular dissection\non this vagal gut brain\ncommunication line at Harvard,\nis trying to uncover what\neach of those lines doing,\nwhat are each of those\nkeys of this piano playing?\n- What's the latest there?\nJust as a brief update.\nI know Steven Lieder Lee,\nI think I was there when he got\nhis Howard Hughes and I did not.\nSo that was fun.\nAlways great to get beat\nby excellent people.\n- First of all, I'm happy you didn't,\nbecause that way you can\nfocus on this amazing podcast.\n- Well, thank you.\nThat's very gracious of you.\nIt's always feels better if not good\nto get beat out by excellent people.\nSteven is second to none.\nAnd he is defining, as you said,\nthe molecular constituents\nof different elements of\nthese many, many fibers,\nis there an update there,\nare they finding multiple\nparallel pathways?\n- They are, they are, some\nthat control heartbeat.\nSome that control the respiratory cycle.\nSome that might be involved\nin a gastric movement.\nYou know, this notion that you're full\nand you feel full in part\nbecause your gut gets distended\nyour stomach, for example.\nAnd then there are little\nsensors that are reading\nthat and telling the brain you're full.\n- So the textbooks will soon change\non the basis of the\nLieder Lee and other work.\n- In essence, I think\nwe are learning enough\nabout these lines, that could\nreally help put together\nthis holistic view of how the brain\nit's truly changing body physiology,\nmetabolism, and immunity,\nthe part that hasn't been yet developed,\nand that it needs a fair amount of work,\nbut it's an exciting thrilling,\njourney of discovery is how\nthe signal comes back to\nnow change that biology.\nYou know, the example I gave\nyou before with Pavlov's dog.\nI figure out how the association created\nthis link between the bell,\nbut then how does the\nbrain tell the pancreas\nto release in the right amount of insulin?\nSo,\nlet me tell you about the gut brain axis\nand our insatiable\nappetite for sugar and fat.\nInsatiable for sugar,\nunquenchable for fat.\nAnd this is a story about\nthe fundamental difference\nbetween liking and wanting.\nLiking sugar is the function\nof the taste system.\nAnd it's not really liking sugar,\nit's liking sweet,\nwanting sugar,\nour never ending appetite\nfor sugar is the story\nof the gut brain axis,\nliking versus wanting.\nAnd this work is work\nof my own laboratory.\nYou know, that began long ago\nwhen we discovered the sweet receptors\nand you can now engineer mice\nthat lack these receptors.\nSo in essence,\nthese animals will be unable\nto taste sweet, a life without sweetness.\nHow horrible.\nAnd if you give a normal mouse,\na bottle containing sweet,\nand we're going to put either\nsugar or an artificial sweetener,\nthey bottle sweet.\nThey have slightly different tastes,\nbut that's simply because\nartificial sweeteners\nhave some off tastes.\nBut as far as the sweet\nreceptor is concerned,\nthey both activate the same receptor,\ntrigger the same signal.\nAnd if you give an animal,\nan option of a bottle containing sugar\nor a sweetener versus water,\nthis animal will drink 10 to one\nfrom the bottle containing sweet.\nThat's the taste system,\nanimal goes samples, each one,\nlicks a couple of licks and then says,\nthat's the one I want\nbecause it's appetitive.\nAnd because I love it.\n- So it prefers sugar\nto artificial sweetener?\n- No, no, no, no, no, no.\nIn this experiment, this experiment,\nI'm going to put only sweet in one bottle\nand it could be either sugar\nor artificial sweetener.\nIt doesn't matter which one.\nWe're going to do the next experiment\nwhere we separate those two,\nfor now is sweet versus water.\nAnd sweet means sweet, not sugar.\nSweet means anything that tastes sweet.\nAnd sugar is one example and\nSplenda is another example.\n- Aspartame, monk fruit,\nStevia, doesn't matter.\n- I mean, there's some\nthat only humans can taste.\nMice cannot taste because their receptors\nbetween humans and mice are different,\nbut we have put the\nhuman receptor into mice.\nWe engineer mice and we completely\nhumanize this mouse's taste world.\nBut for the purpose of this conversation,\nwe're only comparing sweet\nversus water, an option.\nMy goodness,\nthey will lick to know and\nfrom the sweet side 10 to one,\nat least versus the water, makes sense?\nAll right, now we're\ngoing to take the mice\nand we're going to genetically engineer it\nto remove the sweet receptors.\nSo this mice no longer\nhave in their oral cavity,\nany sensors that can detect sweetness,\nbe that sugar molecule be\nan artificial sweetener,\nbe anything else that tastes sweet.\nAnd if you give this mice an option\nbetween sweet versus water,\nsugar versus water, artificial\nsweetener versus water,\nit will drink equally well from both\nbecause he cannot tell them apart\nbecause it doesn't have\nthe receptors for sweet.\nSo that sweet bottle\ntastes just like water.\nMakes sense?\n- Makes sense.\n- Very good.\nNow we're going to do the experiment\nwith sugar from now on\nlet's focus on sugar.\nSo I'm going to give a mouse\nout sugar versus water.\nNormal mouse will drink from the sugar,\nsugar, sugar, sugar, very\nlittle from the water,\nknock out the sweet\nreceptors, eliminate them.\nMouse can no longer tell them apart.\nAnd they will drink from both.\nBut if I keep the mouse in that\ncase for the next 48 hours,\nsomething extraordinary happens\nwhen I come 48 hours later.\nAnd I see what the mouse is\nlicking or drinking from,\nthat mouse is drinking almost exclusively\nfrom the sugar bottle.\nHow could this be?\nIt cannot not taste it.\nIt doesn't have sweet\nreceptors during those 48 hours\nthe mouse learn that there is something\nin that bottle that makes me feel good.\nAnd that is the bottle I want to consume.\nNow does the mouse identify that bottle?\nIt does so by using\nother sensory features,\nthe smell of the bottle,\nthe texture of the solution inside, sugar,\nthe high concentrations is kind of goopy,\nthe side in which the\nbottle is in the cage.\nIt doesn't matter what,\nbut the mouse realize there is something\nthere that makes me feel good.\nAnd that's what I want.\nAnd that is the fundamental\nbasis of our unquenchable\ndesire and our craving for sugar\nand is mediated by the gut brain axis.\nThe first clue is that it\ntakes a long time to develop,\nimmediately suggesting\na post-ingestive effect.\nSo we reason if this is true\nand it's the gut brain axis\nthat's driving sugar preference.\nThen there should be a group\nof neurons in the brain\nthat are responding to\npost-ingestive sugar,\nand low and behold,\nwe identify a group of\nneurons in the brain\nthat does this and these neurons receive\ntheir input directly from\nthe gut brain axis.\n- From other neurons.\n- You got it.\nAnd so what's happening is that\nsugar is recognized normally\nby the tongue, activates\nan appetitive response.\nNow you ingest it and now it\nactivates a selective group\nof cells in your intestines\nthat now send a signal to the brain\nvia the vagal ganglia that says,\nI got what I need.\nThe tongue doesn't know\nthat you got what you need.\nIt only knows that you tasted it.\nThis knows that it got to the point\nthat it's going to be\nused, which is the gut.\nAnd now it sends the\nsignal to now reinforce\nthe consumption of this thing,\nbecause this is the one that I needed.\nSugar, source of energy.\n- And are these neurons in the gut?\n- So these are not neurons in the gut.\nSo these are gut cells that\nrecognize the sugar molecule.\n- [Andrew] I see.\n- Send the signal and\nthat signal is received\nby the vagal neuron directly.\n- Got it.\n- And it sends a signal\nthrough the gut brain axis\nto the cell bodies of these\nneurons in the vagal ganglia,\nand from there to the brain stem\nto now trigger the preference for sugar.\n- Two questions.\nOne, you mentioned that these cells\nthat detect sugar within\nthe gut are actually within the intestine.\nYou didn't say stomach.\nWhich surprised me.\nI always think gut as\nstomach, but of course-\n- They're intestines,\nbecause that's where all\nthe absorption happens.\n- [Andrew] Got it.\n- So you want the signal, you see,\nyou want the brain to know that\nyou had successful ingestion\nand breakdown of whatever you consume into\nthe building blocks of life,\nand glucose, amino acids, fat.\nAnd so you want to make sure\nthat once they are in the form\nthat intestines can now absorb them,\nis where you get the signal\nback saying this what I want.\nNow let me just take it one step further.\nAnd this now sugar molecules\nactivates this unique gut brain\ncircuit that now drives the development\nof our preference for sugar.\nNow, a key element of this circuit\nis that the sensors in\nthe gut that recognize\nthe sugar do not recognize\nartificial sweeteners at all.\n- Because their nutrient value\nis uncoupled from the taste?\n- Generically speaking one can make that,\nbut it's because it's a very\ndifferent type of receptor.\nTurns out that it's not\nthe tongue receptors\nbeing used in the gut.\nIt's a completely different\nmolecule that only recognizes\nthe glucose molecule, not\nartificial sweeteners.\nThis has a profound impact\non the effect of ultimately\nartificial sweeteners\nin curbing our appetite, our craving,\nour insatiable desire for sugar,\nsince they don't activate\nthe gut brain axis,\nthey'll never satisfy the craving\nfor sugar like sugar does.\nAnd the reason I believe\nthat artificial sweeteners\nhave failed in the market\nto curb our appetite.\nOur need, our desire for sugar is\nbecause they beautifully\nwork on the tongue.\nThey liking to recognize\nsweet versus non-sweet,\nbut they fail to activate the key sensors\nin the gut that now inform the brain\nyou got sugar, no need to crave anymore.\n- So the issue of wanting,\ncan we relate that to a particular\nset of neurochemicals upstream,\nso the pathway is, so glucose\nis activating the cells\nin the gut that through the vagus\nthat's communicated through the presumably\nthe nodus ganglia and\nup into the brain stem.\n- Very good, and from\nthere, where does it go?\n- Yeah, where does it go,\nand what is the substrate of wanting?\nOf course I think molecules\nlike dopamine craving,\nthere's a book even called the\nmolecule of more, et cetera.\nDopamine is a very diabolical\nmolecule, as you know,\nbecause it evokes both\na sense of pleasure-ish,\nbut also a sense of\ndesiring more, of craving.\nSo if I understand you correctly,\nartificial sweeteners are,\nand I agree are failing as a means\nto satisfy sugar craving at\nthe level of nutrient sensing.\nAnd yet if we trigger this\ntrue sugar evoked\nwanting pathway too much,\nand we've all experienced this,\nthen we eat sugar and we find ourselves\nwanting more and more sugar.\nNow that could also be\ninsulin dysregulation,\nbut can we uncouple those?\n- I mean, look,\nif we have a mega problem\nwith over consumption of sugar and fat,\nwe're facing a unique time\nin our evolution where\ndiseases of malnutrition\nare due to over-nutrition.\nI mean, how nuts is that?\nHistorically, diseases of malnutrition\nhave always been linked to undernutrition.\nAnd so we need to come up with strategies\nthat can meaningfully change\nthe activation of these\ncircuits that control\nour wanting certainly in\nthe populations at risk,\nand this gut brain circuit that ultimately\nit's the lines of communication\nthat are informing\nthe brain, the presence\nof intestinal sugar,\nin this example,\nit's a very important target\nin the way we think about,\nis there a way that we can\nmeaningfully modulate these circuits?\nSo I make your brain think\nthat you got satisfied with sugar,\neven though I'm not giving you sugar.\n- So that immediately raises\nthe question are the receptors\nfor glucose in these gut cells susceptible\nto other things that are healthier for us.\n- That's very good.\nExcellent idea.\nAnd I think an important\ngoal will be to come up\nwith a strategy and identify\nthose very means that allow us to\nmodulate the circuits in a way\nthat certainly for all of those,\nwhere this is a big issue,\nit can really have a,\nyou know, dramatic impact\nin improving human health.\n- I could be wrong about this.\nAnd I'm happy to be wrong.\nI'm often wrong.\nAnd told I'm wrong, that we\nhave cells within our gut\nthat don't just sense sugar,\nglucose to be specific,\nbut also cells within our gut\nthat sense amino acids and fatty acids.\nI could imagine a scenario\nwhere one could train themselves\nto feel immense amounts of\nsatiety from the consumption\nof foods that are rich in essential\nfatty acids, amino acids,\nperhaps less caloric\nor less insulin dysregulating than sugar.\nI'll use myself as an example.\nI've always enjoyed sweets,\nbut in the last few years,\nfor some reason I've\nstarted to lose my appetite\nfor them probably because I\njust don't eat them anymore.\nAt first that took some restriction.\nNow I just don't even think about it.\n- And you're not reinforcing the circuits.\nAnd so you're in essence\nare removing yourself from,\nbut you tend to be the exception.\nYou know, we have a huge,\na incredible large number\nof people that are being\ncontinuously exposed to\nhighly processed foods.\n- And hidden, so called hidden sugars.\n- They don't even have to be hidden.\nYou know, it's right there.\n- Hiding in plain sight.\nI agree so much is made of\nhidden sugars that we often\noverlook that there are\nalso the overt sugars.\n- I mean, we can have a long discussion\non the importance of\ncoming up with strategies\nthat could meaningfully\nchange public health\nwhen it comes to nutrition.\nBut I want to just go\nback to the notion of\nthis brain centers that\nare ultimately the ones\nthat are being activated by\nthese essential nutrients.\nSo sugar, fat, amino acids are\nbuilding blocks of our diets.\nAnd this is across all animal species.\nSo it's not unreasonable\nthen to assume that\ndedicated brain circuits\nwould've evolved to\nensure their recognition,\ntheir ingestion and the reinforcement\nthat that is what I need.\nAnd indeed animals\nevolve these two systems.\nOne is the taste system that allows you\nto recognize them and trigger\nthis predetermined, hardwired,\nimmediate responses.\nOh my goodness.\nThis tastes so good.\nIt's so sweet.\nI personally have a sweet tooth,\nand you know, oh my God,\nthis is so delicious.\nIt's fatty or umami,\nrecognizing the amino acids.\nSo that's the liking pathway,\nbut in the wisdom of evolution,\nthat's good,\nbut doesn't quite do it.\nYou want to make sure that\nthese things get to the place\nwhere they're needed and they're\nnot needed in your tongue.\nThey're needed in your intestines\nwhere they're going to be absorbed\nas the nutrients that will support life.\nAnd the brain wants to know this,\nand it wants to know it\nin a way that it can now\nform the association between\nthat I just tasted is what got\nwhere it needs to be.\nAnd it makes me feel good.\nAnd so now next time\nthat I have to choose,\nwhat should I eat?\nThat association now guides me to,\nthat's the one I want.\nI want that fruit, not that fruit.\nI want those leaves,\nnot those leaves, because these\nare the ones that activate\nthe right circuits that ensure that\nthe right nutrients got to the right place\nand told the brain, this\nis what I want and need.\nAre we on?\n- We're on.\nOne thing that intrigues\nme and puzzles me,\nis that this effect took a\ncouple of days, at least in mice.\nAnd the sensation, ah, sorry,\nthe perception of taste is immediate.\nand yet this is a slow system.\nAnd so in a beautiful way, but\nin a kind of mysterious way,\nthe brain is able to couple\nthe taste of a sweet drink\nwith the experience of\nnutrient extraction in the gut,\nunder a context where\nthe mouse and the human\nis presumably ingesting other\nthings, smelling other mice,\nsmelling other people.\nThat's incredible.\n- But you have to think\nof it not as humans,\nremember we inherited the\ncircuits of our ancestors\nand they through evolutionary\nfrom their ancestors.\nAnd we haven't had that many\nyears to have fundamentally\nchanged in many\nof these hardwired circuits.\nSo forget as humans,\nlet's look at animals in the wild.\nWhich is easier now to\ncomprehend the logic.\nYou know, why should this take\na long time of continued reinforcement\ngiven that I can taste it in a second?\nYou want to make sure that this\nsource of sugar, for example,\nin the wild is the best.\nIs the richest.\nIt's the one where I get the most energy\nfor the least amount of extraction,\nthe least amount of work.\nI want to identify rich sources of sugar.\nAnd if the system simply\nresponds immediately\nto the first sugar that gets to your gut,\nyou're going to form the association\nwith those sources of food,\nwhich are not the ones that\nyou should be eating from.\n- Don't fall in love with the\nfirst person you encounter.\n- Oh my goodness, exactly.\nAnd so evolutionarily by\nhaving the taste system,\ngiving you the immediate recognition,\nbut then by forcing this gut brain axis\nto reinforce it only when sustained\nrepeated exposure has informed the brain.\nThis is the one you don't want\nto form the association before.\nAnd so when we remove it from the context\nof we just go to the supermarket,\nwe're not hunting there in\nthe wild where I need to form.\nAnd so what's is that\nhighly processed foods are\nhijacking, co-opting\nthese circuits in a way\nthat it would've never happened in nature.\nAnd then we not only find\nthese things appetitive\nand palatable, but in addition,\nwe are continuously reinforcing,\nthe wanting in a way that,\noh my God, this is so great.\nWhat do I feel like eating?\nLet me have more of this.\n- You've just forever changed the way\nthat I think about\nsupermarkets and restaurants.\nThere are understanding\nthis fast signaling\nand this slower signaling\nand the utility of having\nboth makes me realize\nthat supermarkets and restaurants are\nabout the most unnatural\nthing for our system ever,\nalmost the equivalent of living\nin small villages with\nvery few suitable mates\nversus online dating, for instance.\n- I'm not going to make\na judgment call there\nbecause they do serve\nan important purpose.\n- I like restaurants too.\n- And so do supermarkets, thank God.\nI think they're not the culprits.\nI think the culprits of course\nare our reliance\non foods that are not necessarily healthy.\nNow, going back to the supermarket,\ndon't fall in love with the\nfirst, they need to work.\nYou know, you take\na tangerine,\nand you take an extract of tangerine\nthat you used to cook that\nspiked, let's say with sugar\nand you equalize in both\nwhere they both provide the\nsame amount of calories.\nIf you eat them both,\nthey're going to have\na very different effect\nin your gut brain axis on your system.\nOnce you make the extract and\nyou process it and you add\nprocessed sugar to use\nit now to cook, to add,\nto make it really sweet tangerine thing.\nNow you're providing now fully ready\nto use broken down source of sugar,\nin the tangerine that sugar's\nmixed in the complexity\nof a whole set of other\nchemical components,\nfiber, long chains of sugar molecules\nthat need a huge amount\nof work by your stomach,\nyour gut system, to break it down.\nSo you are using a huge amount of energy\nto extract energy and the balance\nit's very different that when\nI take this process highly\nextracted tangerine,\nby the way I use tangerines\nbecause I had a tangerine\njust before I came here.\n- Delicious, they are delicious.\n- And so this goes back to\nthe issue of supermarkets.\nAnd to some degree, given a choice,\nyou don't want to eat\nhighly processed foods\nbecause everything's already\nbeen broken down for you.\nAnd so your system has no work.\nAnd so you are,\nco-opting hijacking the circuits in a way\nthat they're being activated\nat a time scale that\nnormally wouldn't happen.\n- Well, this is why I often feel that,\nand I think a lot of data\nare now starting to support\nthe idea that while indeed the\nlaws of thermodynamics apply\ncalories ingested versus calories burned\nis a very real thing, right?\nThat the appetite for certain foods\nand the wanting and the liking\nare phenomena of the nervous system,\nbrain and gut as you've\nbeautifully described.\nAnd that changes over time,\ndepending on how we are\nreceiving these nutrients.\n- Absolutely.\nLook,\nwe have a lot of work to do.\nI'm talking as society.\nI'm not talking about you and I.\n- We also have a lot of work to do.\n- Now.\nI think understanding\nthe circuits is giving us important\ninsights in how ultimately,\nand hopefully we can improve human health\nand make a meaningful difference.\nNow, it's very easy to try to connect\nthe dots A to B, B to C, C to D.\nAnd I think there's a lot\nmore complexity to it,\nbut I do think that the\nlessons that are emerging\nout of understanding how\nthese circuits operate,\ncan ultimately inform how\nwe deal with our diets\nin a way that we avoid\nwhat we're facing now as a society.\nI mean it's nuts that\nover-nutrition happens\nto be such a prevalent problem.\nAnd I also think the training\nof people who are thinking\nabout metabolic science and\nmetabolic disease is largely\ndivorced from the training\nof the neuroscientist and vice versa.\nNo one field is to blame,\nbut I fully agree that\nthe brain is the key over,\nor the nervous system\nto be more accurate is one of\nthe key overlooked features.\n- Is the arbiter,\nultimately is the arbiter\nof many of these pathways.\n- As a final question.\nAnd one which is simply\nto entertain my curiosity\nand the curiosity of the listeners.\nWhat is your absolute favorite food?\n- Oh, my goodness.\n- Taste, I should say.\nTaste to distinguish between taste\nand the nutritive value or lack thereof.\n- Look, we, unlike every animal\nand every animal species\neat for the enjoyment of it,\nit doesn't happen in the wild,\nmost animals eat when they need to eat.\nDoesn't mean they don't enjoy it,\nbut it's a completely different story.\nI have too many favorite foods\nbecause I enjoy the sensory\nexperience rather than the food itself\nto me is the whole thing, is\nfrom the presentation, look,\nthere've been these experiments\ndone in psycho physics,\nI'm going to take a salad,\nmade out of 11 components\nand I'm going to mix\nthem all up in potpourri\ngreens and other things here.\nAnd in the other one,\nI'm going to present it in\na beautiful arrangement.\nAnd I'm going to put them behind\na glass cabinet and\nI'm going to sell them.\nAnd I'm going to sell one\nfor $2 and one for $8,\nprecisely the same ingredient.\nExactly the same amount of each.\nUltimately you're going to mix them,\nthey're all going to be the same,\nand people will pay the\n$8 because you know what,\nit evokes a different person.\nIt gives you the feel\nthat, oh my goodness,\nI'm going to enjoy that salad.\nSo going back to,\nwhat is my favorite food,\nto me eating is really\na sensory journey.\nI don't mean the every\nday, let me have some\nchicken wings, because\nI'm hungry it, but eh,\nevery piece I think has an important\nevoking sensory role.\nAnd so in terms of categories\nof food I grew up in Chile.\nSo meat has always been,\nbut I eat it so seldom now.\n- Is that right?\n- Yeah, because I know that it's\nnot necessarily the healthiest thing,\nred meat I'm talking about.\nAnd so I grew up eating it every day.\nI'm talking seven days a\nweek, Chile, Argentina,\nthat's the mainstay of our diet.\nNow maybe I have red meat.\nI don't know, once every four weeks.\n- And you enjoy it?\n- Oh, I love it.\nPart of it is because I\nhaven't had it in four weeks.\nBut you know, I love sushi,\nbut I love the art of\nsushi, the whole thing,\nthe way it's presented, it\nchanges the way you taste it.\nI love ethnic food in particular.\n- You're in the right place.\n- You got it, that was the main reason\nI wanted to come to New York.\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n- There's also that\nColumbia University that's-\n- And I came here because\nI wanted to be with\npeople that are thinking about the brain,\nthe same way that I like to think,\nwhich can we solve this big\nproblem, this big question.\n- And certainly you're\nmaking amazing strides\nin that direction.\nAnd I love your answer because\nit really brings together\nthe many features of the circuitries\nand the phenomena we've\nbeen talking about today,\nwhich is that while it begins\nwith sensation and perception,\nultimately it's the context.\nAnd that context is highly\nindividual to person,\nplace and time, and\nmany, many other things\non behalf of myself.\nAnd certainly on behalf\nof all the listeners,\nI want to thank you, first of all,\nfor the incredible work\nthat you've been doing now for decades,\nin vision, in taste and\nin this bigger issue\nof how we perceive and experience life,\nit's truly pioneering and incredible
