    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to\ndiscuss your brain chemistry\nand how to control and\noptimize your brain chemistry\nfor all aspects of mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nMany times before on the\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nand frankly, every time I'm\na guest on another podcast,\nI get questions about science\nand science-based tools\nfor things like enhancing sleep,\nenhancing focus,\nenhancing creativity,\nimproving relationships,\ngetting over grief and on and on,\nall of which are valid questions\nand for which there are protocols\nthat are based in science\nand that work the first\ntime and every time.\nHowever far more important\nthan knowing a protocol\nis understanding why a\ngiven protocol works.\nThat's why I'm always\nhammering on mechanism\nand explaining the cells\nand circuits and chemicals,\nat least to some detail,\nso that people can understand\nnot just what to do,\nbut why it works and therefore,\nhow to change a protocol\nas their life circumstances change,\nor as goals change.\nNow today we are going to\ngo even a layer deeper.\nWe're going to explore the foundations\nof your biology in your brain and body\nthat allow any protocol to work\nbecause as it turns out,\nall of the protocols out there,\nwhether or not it's a breathing protocol\nor a supplement or a prescription drug\nor an exercise routine,\nthey all tap into and leverage\na core set of just a few\nbiological mechanisms.\nThat's right,\nbeneath everything you\nare able to do and feel\nand indeed beneath every\nprotocol that allows you\nto change for the better\nand optimize your mental health,\nphysical health, and performance,\nthere's just a small subset of chemicals\nthat you're leveraging toward that change.\nSo today we are going to talk\nabout the four major\npillars of neurochemistry\nthat allow you to, for instance,\nbe focused when you want to focus,\nthat allow you to relax\nwhen you need to relax and de-stress,\nthat allow you to optimize your sleep,\nthat allow you to optimize\nyour exercise routine\nor to work through a pain\npoint in relationship\nor in career or in your\nrelationship to yourself.\nSo what I can say for sure\nis that by the end of this episode,\nyou will have a much richer understanding\nabout how your brain and nervous system\nand indeed your entire body work.\nAnd you'll have a much\nfirmer understanding\nas to which protocols\nand tools to reach for\ngiven your particular goals in the moment,\nin the day, across the\nweek, across the month,\nacross the year, and indeed\nacross your entire lifespan.\nSo what we're really going\nfor today are principles,\ndeeper understanding of why\nany given protocol works\nand we are also going to\ndiscuss specific protocols.\nSome of those protocols I've discussed\non previous episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut I must say,\nmany of the protocols and\ntools that I will discuss\nare brand new and based on research\nthat I have not discussed at all,\nsimply because the research\npapers came out only recently,\nor these are papers that\nI only recently unearthed.\nIn fact, I'm going to share\nwith you two recent studies\nin a moment that are exceedingly important\nfor optimizing your sleep\nand these are studies that, again,\nI've never discussed\nin any episode on sleep\nor on any other podcast.\nSo by the end of today's episode,\nyou're going to have far more knowledge\nabout your biology and psychology\nthan you did at the start\nand you'll be armed with many more tools\nand most importantly,\nprinciples so that you can navigate\nnot just the tools\npresented on this podcast,\nbut in the vast landscape\nof tools that are out there\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis proud to announce\nthat we've partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe've done that for several reasons.\nFirst of all,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is exceedingly high.\nSecond of all,\nwe wanted to have a location\nwhere you could find\nall of the supplements discussed\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nin one easy to find place.\nYou can now find that place\nat livemomentous.com/huberman.\nIn addition, Momentous\nsupplements ship internationally,\nsomething that a lot of\nother supplement companies\nsimply do not do.\nSo that's terrific whether\nor not you live in the US\nor you live abroad.\nRight now, not all of the supplements\nthat we discuss on the Huberman\nLab Podcast are listed,\nbut that catalog of supplements\nis being expanded very rapidly\nand a good number of them\nthat we've talked about,\nsome of the more prominent\nones for sleep and focus\nand other aspects of\nmental and physical health\nare already there.\nAgain, you can find them at\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nEvery so often, I come across\na study or set of studies\nthat I get so excited about\nthat I start telling\neverybody in my immediate life\nand I insist on also sharing it with you,\nthe listeners of this podcast,\nbecause I find the information\nto be so incredibly\ninteresting and actionable.\nThe two studies that I'm going to discuss\nboth relate to sleep and sleep states\nand how to access better sleep.\nThe first one was published\nin the journal Cell Reports,\nCell Press journal, excellent journal.\nAnd the title of this paper is\n\"Rapid and Reversible\nControl of Human Metabolism\n\"by Individual Sleep States\".\nWe will provide a link to this\nstudy in the show captions.\nThe first author is Nora Nowak, N-O-W-A-K.\nAnd basically what they\ndid is they measured\nthe different forms of\nmetabolism that occur\nwhile humans sleep.\nAs far as I know,\nthis is one of the first\nstudies of this kind.\nThere are many studies of metabolism.\nThere are many studies of sleep.\nThis study focused on how\ndifferent states of sleep\nsuch as rapid eye movement sleep,\nwhich is associated with dreaming\nand high emotional content dreams\nversus slow wave sleep,\nwhich tends to be more\nfocused on physical repair\nof the body, more mundane dreams,\nhow those different states\nof mind during sleep\nrelate to different aspects of metabolism\nand what they found was\nabsolutely fascinating.\nFirst of all,\nthey found that sleep states\nregulate more than 50%,\nhalf of all the metabolite\nfeatures detected\nin human breath.\nWhat does that mean?\nWell, it turns out that you can figure out\nwhat humans are\nmetabolizing in particular,\nmore lipids or more carbohydrate,\nwhether or not they're relying\nmore on glucose metabolism\nbased on the contents of their breath.\nThis is true during\nwaking and during sleep.\nAnd this is what allowed them\nto do these incredible measurements\nof what's being metabolized during sleep.\nThey measured close to\n2000 metabolites in breath,\nevery 10 seconds across\nthe entire night's sleep.\nAnd what they found was that\nthere are major pathways\nrelated to lipid metabolism,\nfat metabolism,\nor to carbohydrate metabolism\nor other forms of metabolism\nthat are up or down regulated\nas human beings transition\nbetween slow wave sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep\nand waking.\nAnd you might say waking?\nWell, yes, they also looked\nas people fell asleep\nand as they emerged from sleep.\nAnd believe it or not every\nso often during sleep,\nyou wake up, you didn't know this,\nbut you wake up in the\nmiddle of the night,\nyou look around and you go back to sleep.\nYou're not aware of it\nbecause you're still\nin a rather sleep like state,\nalthough you are awake.\nWhat they found was that sleep\nand the various states of sleep\nregulated individual metabolic pathways.\nThey found for instance,\nthat the switch from sleep to wakefulness\nreduces fatty acid oxidation.\nSo that means while you're asleep,\nyou're oxidating more fatty acids.\nAnd as you wake up, that\nbecomes less the case.\nAnd there's a switch in slow wave sleep\nthat increases fatty acid oxidation.\nAnd there's this transition\nfrom rapid eye movement sleep\nto other aspects of sleep\nthat brings about things\nlike the so-called TCA cycle.\nSome of you familiar with metabolism\nwill be familiar with the TCA cycle,\nthe so-called tricarboxylic acid cycle,\nintermediates, that's fancy nerd speak\nfor specific aspects of\nmetabolism being regulated\nduring this rapid eye\nmovement sleep transition.\nWhat does all this mean?\nAnd how is this actionable?\nWell, on many episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nsuch as the master sleep episode\nand the episode that we're going\ninto in further depth today,\nwe're going to talk about sleep\nand how to optimize sleep.\nIt's been thought of,\nbut not really tamped down\nthat quality and depth of\nsleep and duration of sleep\nis important for metabolism\nduring the daytime.\nAnd indeed that's the case.\nIf people are sleep deprived\nor they're not sleeping enough,\nthings like glucose metabolism, et cetera,\nget really disrupted during the daytime.\nBut what this current study shows\nis that the metabolism that\nyou experience during sleep,\nor to be more specific,\nthe range of different types of metabolism\nthat you experience during sleep\nmay serve to tune up\nor to ensure that the\nspecific aspects of metabolism\nthat you require during\nwakefulness are working properly.\nIn addition to that,\nthis study clearly shows\nthat getting enough sleep\nallows you to transition\nthrough all the various\nforms of metabolism\nand use all those different forms\nof metabolites during sleep\nin a way that's immensely beneficial\nfor the systems of your brain and body.\nSo the take home message here is that,\nas the author state,\nsleep and experiencing the\ndifferent states of sleep,\nslow wave sleep early in\nthe night, predominantly,\nplus rapid eye movement sleep\ntoward the end of the night\nis extremely important for\noptimizing metabolic circuits\nfor human performance and health.\nIn other words, by not getting\nsufficient duration sleep,\nyou're not allowing your body\nand brain to transition through\nall the different aspects\nof fuel utilization\nand you're not teaching\nyour brain and body\nhow to use similar types of\nfuels during wakefulness.\nSo again, all of this points to the fact\nthat we need to be\ngetting sufficient quality\nand duration of sleep.\nSo if you're sleep deprived,\neven by an hour or so,\nyou're going to get far less\nrapid eye movement sleep\nbecause rapid eye movement\nsleep is what occurs\ntoward the end of a sleep night.\nDuring the early part of the night,\nfar more slow wave sleep.\nIn getting less rapid eye movement sleep,\nwe know it makes you\nmore emotionally labile,\nbut now we know it's also\ngoing to alter certain forms\nof glucose metabolism\nduring the night\nand during wakefulness.\nSo that all underscores\nthe need to get sleep.\nBut then the question is\nhow to get enough sleep\nand how to make sure you get\ninto all these different sleep states.\nAnd this is particularly important\nfor you so-called night owls.\nThere's a lot of controversy out there\nas to whether or not different\nso-called chronotypes exist,\nthat is people who just\nnaturally or genetically\nwant to be an early bird,\nwake up early and go to bed early.\nSo these people that wake up at 4:00 AM\nand would be most comfortable going to bed\nby seven or 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM.\nThen they are so called night owls,\npeople that would feel\nbest or tend to feel best\nwhen they go to sleep at 1:00\nAM, 2:00 AM, even 3:00 AM,\nand like to wake up\nlater 8:00, 9:00, 10:00,\nor even 11:00 AM or noon.\nAnd then of course,\nmost people go to sleep somewhere\nbetween 10:00 PM and midnight\nand wake up somewhere\nbetween 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM,\nor I suppose more typically\n6:00 AM and 8:00 AM.\nNow whether or not real chronotypes exist\nor whether or not people\nsimply select schedules\nfor sleep and wakefulness that they like\nbecause of their social schedules\nor the activities they enjoy.\nFor instance, some people\nlike to really go out,\nthey like to go out dancing or hear music,\nor spend time in venues that\nare only open late at night,\nand don't even open until noon or after.\nOther people like myself\nrarely go out at night\nbut I like to get up early.\nI like to exercise.\nI like to see the sunrise, et cetera.\nSo I don't know if I'm a morning person\nor an evening person.\nI just know the things I enjoy\ntend to happen in the\nearly part of the day.\nAnd the things that I\ndon't enjoy quite as much\ntend to happen late at night.\nRegardless of whether or not\nthere are real genetic propensities\nto be a night owl or an early bird\nor a sort of typical person\nright there in the middle,\nit's very important that people\nhave some control over\ntheir sleep schedule\nand even more important,\nthat people are able to\nget sufficient amount\nof REM sleep and slow wave sleep,\nfor many reasons,\nbut including the reasons I discussed\nin the previous study\nrelated to metabolism.\nI'm very excited, therefore,\nabout a study that came\nout in sleep medicine.\nThis was a few years ago, but\nsomehow I missed this one.\nIt was published in 2019.\nAnd the title of this article is\n\"Resetting the Late Timing of 'Night Owls'\n\"Has a Positive Impact on Mental Health,\n\"Physical Health and Performance\".\nThis is a study done in humans,\nfocusing specifically on people\nthat like to stay up late and sleep in,\nbut who desire to be able\nto get up and feel alert\nin order to go to work or study\nand they want to go to\nsleep a bit earlier.\nAnd so there are a lot of questions\nembedded in this study in particular,\nwhether or not people can\nactually shift their schedule\nby a few hours or more.\nSome people out there contend\nthat if you're a night owl,\nthat's just going to be impossible\nor very, very challenging to do.\nTurns out it's not impossible\nand it's not even that challenging to do\nprovided you do the right things.\nJust a brief overview of the study\nand then I'll give you the key takeaways.\nIt was a randomized control trial.\nIt involved a number of different people,\nboth male and female.\nAnd what they did was they\nused non-pharmacological,\npractical interventions\nin a real world setting,\nhere I'm paraphrasing.\nThey used targeted light exposure.\nThey used consistent sleep, wake times.\nThey used fixed meal times,\ncaffeine intake and exercise.\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nI love this study so much\nbecause I've done episodes\nwhere I've talked about temperature,\nexercise, feeding, and most importantly,\nlight exposure as a way to control\nand shift your sleep wake cycles,\nyour so-called circadian\ntiming and entrainment.\nWhat did they find?\nWell, they found \"Significant improvements\n\"in terms of mood so far\nless depression and stress\",\nsubjectively measured,\n\"as well as improved\ncognitive performance\",\nthat was objectively measured.\nSo improved reaction times,\nimproved physical grip strength,\nwhich is actually a measure\nnot just of strength per se,\nbut also of nervous system function\nand a number of things\nthat people could do\nin order to optimize their morning hours,\neven though they were\nnight owls previously.\nWhat did they have people do?\nWell, I'm going to just\ngoing to list this off\nsort of rapid fire succession.\nThen we'll provide a link to the study\nif you want to learn more.\nFirst of all, they told participants\nto try and wake up two to three hours\nbefore their typical wake up time,\ntwo to three hours.\nThat seems brutal to me\nand probably seems brutal to you\nif you're somebody who\ntypically wakes up at 10:00 AM\nto try and get up at eight\nor even 7:00 AM consistently,\nbut they were also asked to maximize\noutdoor light exposure during the mornings\nfor reasons that if you've\nlistened to this podcast before,\nif you've heard me talk about before,\nyou know, that I'm\nconstantly talking about,\nI'll probably go into the grave shouting,\nplease get as much light exposure\nfrom sunlight early in the day as possible\nbecause it sets in motion\na huge number of things\nthat are beneficial\nfor your mental health\nand physical health,\nincluding dopamine production,\ntiming melatonin production correctly,\nreducing cortisol peaks late in the day,\net cetera, et cetera.\nSo they asked them to get a\nlot of outdoor light exposure.\nThey didn't give them a specific amount.\nWhat they said,\nmaximize outdoor light\nexposure during the mornings,\nthe time before noon.\nAnd again, they had them\nwaking up two to three hours\nbefore their habitual wake up time.\nThey were also told,\nand this is very important\nif you're going to shift\nyour schedule earlier,\nto try and keep sleep wake times fixed\nbetween their work days\nand their weekends.\nSo not sleeping in on the weekends\nor not having any sleep in days,\nregardless of how well they\nslept the night before.\nHow fixed?\nWithin 15 to 30 minutes of\ntheir pre-designated time.\nSo if they were waking up\nat seven o'clock one day,\nthey set their alarm and they\nmade sure they got out of bed\nat seven o'clock every day\nplus or minus 30 minutes,\nbut never later than 7:30,\nnever earlier than 6:30.\nParticipants were also\nasked to try and go to sleep\ntwo to three hours before\ntheir habitual bedtime.\nSo again, these are people\nthat want to stay up late,\nlike 11:00 PM, perhaps,\nbut even as late as 1:00 AM or 2:00 AM.\nAnd now they are asked to go to sleep\ntwo to three hours before\ntheir habitual bedtime\nand to wake up two to three hours earlier,\nas I mentioned earlier.\nThey were also told,\nand I love this because it\nfits with many of the things\nwe've talked about on this podcast before,\nto try and limit light\nexposure during the evenings,\ndim the lights or limit\naltogether artificial lights.\nLot of reasons for that,\nI covered that in the\nMaster Sleep episode,\nI covered that in the Optimized\nHealth Using Light episode.\nYou can find those at HubermanLab.com.\nThey're asking them to do that here.\nAnd they asked participants\nto keep a regular schedule\nfor their daily meals,\nnot eating on the hour consistently,\nyou know, at 9:00 AM,\nnoon, 3:00 PM, exactly.\nBut within again, about 15 to 30 minutes,\nthey're always eating at the same times.\nThat was also important.\nAnd again, that's because\nwe have these so-called\nfood in trained circadian clocks.\nWhen you eat, tells your\nbody when to be alert\nand when you're not\neating, when to be asleep.\nAnd they were told to\nnot drink any caffeine\nafter 3:00 PM in the afternoon.\nAnother theme that we've\ntalked about on this podcast.\nThey were also told not to\ntake naps after 4:00 PM.\nNaps are an interesting feature\nof the sleep wake cycle.\nTo be very brief about this\nand to pull from the episode\nthat I did with world sleep expert\nfrom the University of\nCalifornia Berkeley, Matt Walker,\nnaps are great for many people,\nbut don't nap if it interferes\nwith your nighttime sleep.\nAnd in this study, they told\nthem don't nap after 4:00 PM.\nAnd if you are a napper, don't\nnap for more than 90 minutes.\n10 minute naps are fine.\n20 minute naps are fine.\nZero minute naps are fine,\nbut don't nap for more than 90 minutes.\nAnd don't nap after 4:00 PM.\nAnd to exercise during the morning.\nNow this one can be a bit controversial\nbecause I know a lot of the PTs out there\nand a lot of the online, you know,\ngym rats and people who,\nand runners too, for that matter,\nwill say, well according to\nbody temperature and research,\nit's best to exercise in the afternoon.\nLook, it's better to exercise sometime\nas opposed to no time,\nbut if you're focused on how\nto shift your schedule earlier,\nmeaning get up earlier\nand go to sleep earlier,\nthis study had people exercise\nin the early part of the day,\ncertainly before 2:00 PM\nand ideally before noon.\nSo again, this is a really important study\nbecause it combines a lot\nof different variables\nto arrive at this very impressive shift\nwhere people can get up\ntwo to three hours earlier\nand then pretty\nconsistently and reflexively\nstart going to bed two\nto three hours earlier,\nfeeling more alert during the day,\nagain, improvements in\ncognitive performance,\nmood and physical performance,\ngrip, strength, et cetera.\nVery few studies are able to\nor are willing to tackle so many variables\nand combine them in one study.\nThis paper, I think, does a\nmarvelous job of doing this\nand is incorporating\nthings that individually,\neach have some support for them\nin animal studies and\nprevious human studies.\nBut as far as I know,\nthis is one of the few studies\nthat really combines all\nthese different features\nin one place,\neating times, keeping those consistent,\ngetting maximal sunlight\nexposure earlier in the day,\ngetting up at a consistent time,\ngoing to sleep at a\nconsistent time and on and on.\nIt's a really marvelous\nstudy for that reason.\nAnd I think for any of\nyou that are night owls\nand any of you that want to\nreinforce your early waking\nand early to bed times,\nand I think for most all of you\nwho fall into that general middle category\nof tend to go to sleep somewhere\nbetween 10:00 PM and midnight,\n'cause that's most people\nand tend to wake up sometime\nbetween 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM,\nwell, maybe you want to\nbecome more of an early riser\nor maybe you're going to travel\nor the seasons are changing\nand you want to shift your time\nor you have a new job, et cetera,\nor something that's actually very common\nin terms of relationship struggle.\nYou want to match your wake sleep times,\nor maybe you want to offset\nyour wake sleep times\nfrom a significant other,\nthese sorts of approaches\nthat I described here\nand that are supported\nby the data in this paper\nare absolutely powerful\nand science supported.\nAnd I'm certain that if\nyou were to apply them,\nthat you would see\nessentially the same effects\nthat were observed here.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens now called AG1.\nAG1 is an all-in-one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink\nthat also includes adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes for health.\nNow the probiotics are\nparticularly important to me\nbecause there is now a wealth of data\nshowing that our gut microbiome,\nthat is trillions of little microbacteria\nthat are good for us,\nimpact our immune system, our hormones,\nand the so-called gut brain access,\nthe connections between\nour gut and our brain\nthat go in both directions,\ngut to brain and brain to gut,\nthat control things like our mood,\nour ability to think clearly\nand focus and overall brain health.\nAnd with AG1, I'm able to\noptimize that gut brain access\nthrough the probiotics and\nthe vitamins, minerals,\nadaptogens and digestive enzymes,\nsupport a number of other things\nthat relate to immediate\nand long-term health.\nIn fact, anytime people ask me,\nwhat's the one supplement\nthey should take,\nI say AG1 Athletic Greens,\nbecause it's going to\ncover all of your bases\nto the greatest degree.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it easy to mix up\nAG1 while you're on the road.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nVitamin D3 and K2 are important\nfor cardiovascular function\nand calcium regulation,\nand a number of other\nimportant aspects of health.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nand the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd frankly, I'm not a big\nfan of the word nootropics.\nI've said that on various\npodcasts and on social media posts\nand the reason I'm not a\nfan of the word nootropics\nis it means smart drugs,\nbut as a neuroscientist,\nI know that we don't have\ncircuits in the brain\nor chemicals in the brain for being smart.\nWe have circuits in the brain for focus\nand for task switching and for creativity.\nAnd oftentimes, those circuits\ndiffer from one another,\nalthough they collaborate to create things\nthat we think of as intelligence\nor focus or creativity, et cetera.\nThesis understands this\nand for that reason\nhas developed custom nootropics\nthat are matched to your particular goals\nand to your particular biology.\nThey give you the opportunity\nto try several different blends\nover the course of a month\nand discover which ones work best for you\nand which ones don't.\nIn addition to that personalization,\nthey take it a step further\nby offering free\nconsultations with a coach\nto help you optimize your experience\nand dial in your perfect formulas.\nI've be using Thesis for\nabout eight months now\nand I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nare the best that I've ever used.\nMy go-to formula is the Clarity formula\nor the Motivation formula\nwhen I'm going to work or work out,\nmeaning I'm going to do\nfocus cognitive work,\nor I'm going to exercise.\nI also like their Energy\nformula prior to exercise.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to takethesis.com/huberman.\nYou can take a three minute\nquiz that will help match you\nto the best custom\nnootropics to start with.\nAnd Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in that first month.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from\nyour blood and your DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the things\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be measured from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA test,\nyou can also get insight\ninto, for instance,\nwhat is your biological age\nand how does that compare\nto your chronological age?\nAnd of course, your biological age\nis really the one that matters.\nWith InsideTracker, there's\nan additional advantage\nover other blood tests and DNA tests.\nAnd that is with many blood\ntests and DNA tests out there,\nyou get information back about\nhormones, lipids, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey have a very simple,\neasy to use personalized platform\nthat tells you what sorts of changes\nto make in your nutrition,\npossible changes to supplementation,\nbehavioral changes, et cetera,\nthat will allow you to bring the numbers\nrelated to your hormones\nand your lipids, et cetera,\ninto the ranges that are\noptimal for your mental health,\nphysical health and performance goals.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can go to

chemistry\nfor a sake of health and performance.\nNow in order to do that,\nwe all need to be on the same page\nabout some basic facts.\nSome of those basic facts\ninvolve learning some basic biology.\nAnd I promise that even if\nyou don't have a biology\nor chemistry background,\neverything I'm about to\nsay should be accessible\nand clear to you.\nThe important thing to know\nis that your brain and your spinal cord\nand the rest of your\nso-called nervous system\ncontrol all the organs of your body\nand that all the organs\nof your body feed back,\nmeaning they communicate through\nchemicals and other means,\nto your nervous system.\nNow your nervous system plays\na particularly important role\nin generating everything from sleep\nto wakefulness, creativity,\nstress, calm, et cetera,\nby way of a particular type\nof cell-cell interaction.\nAnd that's called synaptic communication.\nWhat is synaptic communication?\nWell, in order to understand that\nlet's dial back a little bit further\nand try and understand for a moment\nwhat makes up your nervous system.\nIn its simplest form,\nyour nervous system is made of nerve cells\nthat we call neurons.\nNeurons communicate with one\nanother through chemicals.\nThey release certain chemicals\nthat make other neurons\nmore or less likely to\nbe electrically active.\nWhat do we mean by electrically active?\nWe mean,\nas it sounds,\nelectricity passing down through cells\nand then literally causing\nelectricity in other cells.\nThe simplest way to think about this\nis maybe when you were a\nkid or maybe even still now,\nyou would wear socks and\nyou'd shuffle along the floor\nto generate some static electricity,\nand then you'd touch\nsomeone [playful whirring]\nand you'd shock them with your finger.\nI'm a younger brother\nso I'd occasionally do that to my sister.\nI had friends, we would\ndo that to one another.\nI know it's kind of silly and childish,\nyet, it illustrates the principle\nthat we can generate\nelectricity and pass electricity\nto other beings or in the case of neurons,\nfrom one neuron to the next.\nThe way neurons do that,\nis that in between the neurons,\nthey're little spaces,\nthose little spaces are called synapses\nand neurons literally vomit,\nwell, they don't literally vomit,\nbut they release little packets\nof so-called transmitter chemical\ninto that space we call a synapse.\nIt travels across the synapse.\nIt attaches to the cell on the other side,\nthe other neuron.\nAnd then depending on\nwhat that chemical is,\nit either makes that next\nneuron more electrically active\nor less electrically active,\nso called excitation,\nit either excites the next neuron\nto be electrically active also,\nor it inhibits, it\nprevents the next neuron\nfrom being electrically active.\nSo again, very simply,\nwe have nerve cells that\ncommunicate with one another\nthrough electricity and chemicals\nthat inspire that electricity\nand the little gaps between\nneurons are called synapses.\nIf you can understand that,\nI'm certain you can make it\nthrough the rest of the episode\nand that you'll get all the\ndepth and important detail\nthat you need to know.\nBut I want to go just a little bit further\nand explain that neurons\ndon't just talk one-to-one.\nThere are trillions of\nneurons in your nervous system\nthat allow you to be happy, to be in love,\nto be sad, to be in grief,\nto remember things and so on.\nAnd what you do at any moment,\nwhat you feel and what you think\nrelates to which so-called\nneural circuits are active.\nSo a lot of times we\nthink about brain areas\nand we've all seen these\npictures of the brain\nwhere, you know, someone\nwas in a fMRI scanner,\nor they were in a brain\nscanner of some sort,\nand they saw a picture of something\nand a certain area of the\nbrain lights up as it's called.\nThat lighting up of the\nbrain really reflects\nthe activity of hundreds,\nif not thousands,\nmaybe even millions of\nneurons in that region.\nThose images of brain areas lighting up\nand indeed talking about\nbrain areas lighting up,\ncan be a little bit or a lot misleading\nbecause in fact, no single brain area\ncontrols any one single perception\nor behavior or feeling state.\nRather, we have so-called neuro circuits,\nchains of neurons,\nchains of specific neurons that is,\nthat create different states of mind\nthat lead to specific behaviors\nthat lead to specific emotional states.\nAnd those neural circuits are made up\nof lots of different\nbrain areas that light up\nin particular sequences.\nAnd when I say light up, excuse me,\nwhat I mean is that particular\nbrain areas either excite\nor prevent the excitation,\nthat is they inhibit other brain areas\nin a particular sequence.\nMuch like keys on a piano\nplayed in a particular sequence,\nmakes up a particular song,\nparticular brain areas\nactivated or made silent\nin a particular sequence\nleads to a particular behavior\nlike getting up out of a chair\nor a particular feeling state\nlike being particularly happy\none day when you wake up\nor particularly depressed,\nwhether or not that depression\nis caused by a life event\nor whether not it arises spontaneously.\nSo we have neurons, we have synapses\nand we have neural circuits.\nAnd vitally important is the fact that\nwhich neural circuits are active\nand which neural circuits\nare likely to be less active\nat any given moment,\ndepends on two major\ncategories of chemicals.\nIt depends on hormones\nand it depends on\nso-called neuromodulators.\nNow we're mainly going to\nfocus on neuromodulators today\nbecause those are the things\nthat if you can learn to control them,\nand indeed there are\ntools to control them,\nthen you can control which neural circuits\nare more likely or less\nlikely to be active\nin you at any given moment.\nAnd in doing so,\nyou can control whether or not\nyou are going to be alert\nand focused or deeply asleep.\nYou can control whether or not\nyou are going to be in a creative state\nor whether or not you're\ngoing to be in a state of mind\nmore fit, more capable that is\nof doing focused work or math\nor more so-called linear types of work\nwhere there's a correct answer.\nThere's a specific thing to follow\nand you're simply going to\nplug and chug as it were\nthrough a particular set of steps\nin order to accomplish something.\nOr for instance,\nwhether or not you're going\nto be in a more relaxed\nand creative state where\nyou're thinking about new ideas\nor new ideas just seem to be\nspontaneously coming to mind.\nAll of that can be controlled\nto a considerable extent\nby leveraging these\nso-called neuromodulators.\nWhat are neuromodulators?\nNeuromodulators are particular chemicals\nthat make it likely\nthat certain neuro circuits\nwill be active and not others.\nAnd the four neuromodulators\nthat we're going to talk about today\nthat are of the utmost\nimportance for your goals\nare dopamine,\nepinephrine also called adrenaline,\nserotonin and acetylcholine.\nThat's dopamine, epinephrine,\nserotonin and acetylcholine.\nToday, I'm going to teach you\nhow each of those different categories\nof neuromodulators work\nand the things that you can do\nto control those neuromodulators,\nthat is increase them or decrease them\nthrough behavioral tools\nand supplementation,\nin ways that allow you to access\nthe brain and body states that you want\nat the times that you want.\nJust very quickly.\nI want to talk about how\nneuromodulators are able to work,\nregardless of whether or not it's dopamine\nor serotonin or epinephrine, et cetera.\nThere are many features of\nhow neuromodulators work,\nbut for sake of today's discussion,\nwe only need to focus on\ntwo of those features.\nAnd those are fast-acting features\nand longer slower features\nor what we call baseline features.\nWhat am I talking about when\nI say faster or baseline?\nWell, consider that at any given moment,\nwhether or not you're asleep or awake,\nwhether or not it's morning\nor afternoon or night,\nyou have some amount of dopamine\nbeing released in your brain and body,\nsome amount of serotonin,\nsome amount of epinephrine\nand some amount of acetylcholine.\nIt is rarely, if ever the case,\nthat you have zero\ndopamine or zero serotonin.\nYou know, so often we hear about someone\nbeing dopamine depleted\nor these days, you hear\na lot about that anyways.\nOr you'll hear that people's\nserotonin is bottomed out.\nIn reality, none of these neuromodulators\never disappear completely,\nbut they tend to be\npresent at different levels\nor different relative levels.\nAnother important thing to point out\nis that they don't work alone.\nIn fact, as you'll soon learn,\ndopamine and epinephrine are close cousins\nthat collaborate in\nterms of creating states\nof focus and motivation, for instance,\nor in creating states of energy\nand the pursuit of particular goals.\nWhen I say they're close cousins,\nwhat I mean is that they tend to impact\nsome of the same neural circuits.\nAnd believe it or not,\ndopamine and epinephrine\nare chemically related, too.\nI'll just tell you right now\nthat epinephrine is actually\nderived from dopamine,\nchemically epinephrine,\nthat is adrenaline,\nis made from the molecule dopamine.\nNow dopamine and serotonin\ncan also work together\nto impact certain circuits in the brain.\nBut in large part,\nthey operate on separate circuits.\nAnd acetylcholine,\nwhich you'll soon learn is involved\nin states of focus and\ncan actually open up,\nit can literally create states in the mind\nin which your brain is more plastic\nand able to change and learn more quickly.\nWell, acetylcholine\ncan do that on its own,\nbut rarely does it do it on its own.\nMore typically, it gets assistance\nfrom some of the other neuromodulators.\nNow that might seem like\nit complicates the picture,\nbut it actually makes\nthe picture far simpler\nbecause what we can say for sure\nis that the fast actions of dopamine\nor the fast actions of epinephrine,\nserotonin or acetylcholine\nare actions that occur on the\norder of seconds or minutes\nor up to about an hour or so.\nWhereas the slower actions\nof those neuromodulators\ntend to occur on the order of\nhours, days, or even weeks.\nNow perhaps surprisingly,\nI'd like to focus on the slow actions\nof the neuromodulators first,\nbecause those slow actions\nof the neuromodulators\nare happening in you and in\nme and in everyone right now,\nand they set the backdrop,\nthe context in which the various tools\nto manipulate dopamine,\nepinephrine, serotonin,\nor acetylcholine will work.\nWhat do I mean by the context\nor the backdrop or the baseline?\nWell, it's fair to say that most people\nare awake during the\ndaytime and asleep at night.\nI do realize that there are people\nwho are going to be doing shift work\nor they're raising young children,\nor that might have a sick person at home\nthat they're tending to, et cetera,\nor even have insomnia,\nthey're tending to them.\nSo schedules of sleep and\nwakefulness will vary,\nbut in general, everybody,\nregardless of whether\nor not you're nocturnal\nor you're, so-called, diurnal,\nyour awake during the day,\npretty much everybody\nfollows a schedule in which\nfrom zero to nine hours after waking,\nthat is from the time you wake up\nuntil about nine hours later,\nthe neuromodulators,\ndopamine and epinephrine,\ntend to be at their highest\nlevels that they will be\nat any point in the 24-hour period,\nin any period of the day.\nSo we can call this\nzero to nine hour period\nphase one of the day, just for simplicity.\nAnd I've referred to this\nbefore in a previous episode,\nbut not in this exact context.\nFrom nine to about 16 hours is\nwhat we would call phase two.\nAnd that's when dopamine\nand epinephrine levels\ntend to subside a bit\ncompared to the earlier\nphase one part of the day\nand serotonin levels start to increase.\nAnd then phase three of the 24-hour cycle,\nwhich is from about,\nand again about the zero approximates,\nfrom about 17 hours after waking\nuntil about 24 hours after waking\nis phase three of the day.\nAnd during that time,\nthere is chaos in terms of which\nneuromodulators are most\npresent in the brain.\nAnd by chaos, what I mean\nis that during sleep,\nyou have incredible peaks in acetylcholine\nand drops in acetylcholine.\nYou have incredible peaks in dopamine\nand drops in dopamine.\nYou have incredible peaks in serotonin\nand drops in serotonin.\nMost often, you are not going to see\nmuch if any release of\nepinephrine, adrenaline,\nand that's because epinephrine,\nalso called adrenaline,\ntends to wake us up and put\nus into action mode behaviors\nand that's simply not\nhappening during sleep.\nBut for the other three neuromodulators,\nacross the night,\nit's sort of chaos.\nYou've got peaks and\ndrops and peaks and drops\nin different combinations\nthan you would ever see in wakefulness.\nAnd this plays important\nroles in dreaming,\nimportant roles\nin some of the reparative\nfunctions of sleep.\nThe point is that during that phase three,\nthe levels of neuromodulators\nare all over the place,\nbut it's not random, right?\nI say it's chaos, but it's organized\naccording to the specific\nreparative goals of sleep,\nthe specific metabolic\nroles of sleep, et cetera.\nWe're not going to focus too\nmuch on phase three today\nbecause phase three of the 24-hour cycle,\nthat 17 to 24-hour period,\nis one in which you ought\nto be deeply asleep,\nwhether or not you're\nnocturnal or diurnal, right?\n17 hours after waking,\nyou ought to be asleep.\nAnd there are a lot of\nepisodes of this podcast.\nAnd indeed, today, I started talking about\ntwo particular studies related to sleep,\nand there are a lot of tools\nto enhance sleep, et cetera.\nAnd of course there are\nthings that you can do\nin the late portion of\nphase two of the day\nin order to enhance your transition time\ninto and depth of sleep.\nBut you can't really do\nmuch during sleep, right?\nYou're not taking supplements.\nYou're not doing breathing practices.\nThere are things to fall back asleep,\nbut you're not really\ndoing much during sleep.\nSo we're mainly going to focus\non what we're calling\nphase one and phase two.\nPhase one, being this dopamine\nepinephrine dominated phase of our day.\nAnd phase two being this more serotonergic\nor serotonin dominated portion of the day.\nAnd then you might say,\nwell, what about acetylcholine?\nYou forgot about acetylcholine?\nWell, we didn't forget\nabout acetylcholine.\nAcetylcholine is under control\nmore in terms of what\nwe happen to be doing\nat any given moment,\nwhether or not we're\nfocusing or not focusing,\nwhether or not we're\nlearning or not learning.\nAnd here I'm referring to acetylcholine\nspecifically in the context\nof the brain and thinking,\nbecause as some of you\nare probably shouting out there, right,\nif you're an exercise physiologist\nor you know anything about how\nthe brain controls movement,\nacetylcholine is used at the\nnerve to muscle synapse, right?\nSo neurons don't just control\nother neurons electrically.\nThe way you are able to move in fact\nis because neurons are controlling\nthe electric activity of muscles,\nliterally the contraction\nof muscle fibers,\nand that control is exerted\nthrough the release of acetylcholine.\nSo acetylcholine is working\nat muscles, as well,\nbut we're not focused on that today.\nWe're focused on what we can do\nduring phase one of the day\nand what we can do during\nphase two of the day\nto control the specific neuromodulators,\ndopamine, epinephrine,\nserotonin, and acetylcholine,\ntoward particular end goals.\nAnd as I've been harping\non for the last five\nor 10 minutes or so,\nit is important to understand\nthat in the early phase\none part of the day,\nagain, zero to nine hours,\ndopamine and epinephrine already\ndominate the neuromodulator landscape.\nThat is they are already elevated\nand then they will taper off in phase two.\nWhereas in phase two of the day,\nserotonin tends to dominate\nmore than dopamine and epinephrine.\nAnd so if you think about that,\nwhat it means is that if your goal\nis to increase serotonin\nin order to get some particular effect\non your mental performance\nor physical performance or health,\nor if your goal is to increase\nyour dopamine or epinephrine,\nto get some particular\neffect on your mental health,\nphysical performance, et cetera,\nwell, then you need to consider\nwhat the background level of dopamine\nor epinephrine or serotonin happens to be\nbecause in doing so,\nyou will know which tool to select\nand how hard you need to\npush on that tool, right?\nIf your levels of dopamine are\nalready riding pretty high,\nbecause it's the early part of the day,\nwell then it doesn't take a whole lot more\nto get dopamine to a\nlevel in which it can,\nfor instance, change\nyour level of motivation.\nWhereas if you are in\nthe late part of the day,\nlet's say eight or 9:00 PM,\nand you have a lot of serotonin\nswimming around in your system\nand you really need to\nbe focused and alert,\nwell, you can do that by\nleveraging the dopamine\nand epinephrine system\nand indeed the acetylcholine system too,\nbut you're going to\nhave to resort to tools\nthat can do that far more potently\nand that can do that in\na much more sustained way\nif you're going to access\nthe state that you want.\nSo again, it's really\nimportant to understand\nwhat the backdrop of\nthese neuromodulators is,\nthe so-called baseline\nand that they vary across the day\nif you are going to be\nable to leverage tools\nto optimize your brain chemistry.\nAnyone that tells you do this protocol\nin order to increase your dopamine,\ndo this protocol,\nor take this supplement to\nincrease your serotonin,\nthey can be telling\nyou the absolute truth,\nbut if you don't consider the backdrop\nover which that supplement\nor behavior is going to have its effect,\nwell, then you can't really\npredict the effect it will have.\nBut if you can understand these\nbackdrop baseline elements\nto how neuromodulators work,\nwell, then you're in a terrific position\nto leverage the best tools\nin the immediate and short-term\nand that is on the order of\nseconds, minutes and hours.\nBefore we dive into the more pointed,\ndirected effects of specific\ntools on neuromodulators,\nI'd like to just briefly mention hormones\nbecause they are also important\nfor understanding the\nbackground and the context\nand these baseline levels\nof neuromodulators.\nNow here, I'm going to paint\nwith a bit of a broad brush,\nbut what I will say is accurate,\neven though it might not be exhaustive.\nWhat I mean by that is everything\nI'm about to say is true,\nbut it doesn't cover\nevery example in detail\nand nuanced possibility out there.\nHormones have many different\neffects on the brain and body\nand not unlike neuromodulators,\nsome of those effects are very fast.\nSome of them are very slow.\nIn fact, certain hormones,\nfor instance, the steroid hormones,\nlike estrogen and like testosterone\nand corticosteroids\nand here, of course,\nI'm referring to the steroid\nhormones for what they are.\nThey are indeed steroid hormones,\nbut I'm not talking about steroids\nthat people inject for sports performance\nor for physical augmentation.\nI'm talking about the steroid hormones\nthat you make naturally\nbecause indeed you make these naturally.\nWell, the steroid hormones\ncan actually control gene expression.\nThey can change the identity of cells\nand the genes and proteins\nthat cells express.\nThis is why during puberty, for instance,\ntestosterone and estrogen\nare released into the body,\ngrowth hormone is released into the body\nand bodies and voices and personalities\nand brains change tremendously\nbecause literally there\nis a transformation\nof the breast tissue,\nof the testicular tissue,\nof the ovarian tissue, of\nthe bones, of the muscles,\nof the tissues and cells\nthat control hair growth.\nGene expression changes\nin all those cell types.\nAnd the child becomes an adolescent,\nbecomes a young adult, right?\nThat's what puberty really is.\nIn fact, puberty is perhaps\nthe most dramatic transformation\nthat we go through\nin our entire lifespan\nin terms of our aging,\n'cause indeed it reflects a very rapid,\nI should mention, period of aging\nand transformation of\nthe identity of cells.\nSo steroid hormones and other hormones\ncan have very slow long-lasting\nactions in that way.\nThey can also have very fast actions.\nSo for instance,\nadrenaline, epinephrine,\nreleased from the adrenal glands\ncan immediately make\nyour heart beat faster,\ncan immediately change the circumference\nof your blood vessels and\narteries and capillaries\nand change the way blood flows.\nIt can change the way you\nsee the world, literally.\nIt does change the way you see the world\nthrough your visual system.\nAnd that all happens on the order\nof hundreds of milliseconds or seconds,\nthese are extremely fast actions.\nCorticosteroid also can have\nfast actions and slow actions.\nBut since this isn't a\ndiscussion about hormones per se,\nand we've done entire episodes\nlike the Optimize Testosterone\nand Estrogen episode.\nYou can find that at HubermanLab.com.\nOr the interview with the\nincredibly knowledgeable\nand clear and\nreally wonderful tutor of\nactionable information,\nDr. Kyle Gillette, who\nis also on this podcast,\nyou can learn a lot about hormones there.\nToday, we want to think about hormones\nas they relate to these neuromodulators,\nthe dopamine, serotonin,\nepinephrine and acetylcholine,\nand in general,\ntestosterone tends to collaborate with\nand increase the action of dopamine.\nThat's not always the\ncase, but in general,\nwhen testosterone goes\nup, dopamine goes up\nand sometimes even vice versa.\nWhen dopamine goes up, testosterone go up.\nAnd this is true for both\nmales and for females.\nIn general, when corticosteroids\nlike cortisol and some related\nsteroid hormones increase,\nepinephrine levels go up.\nAnd in general, when\nhormones like oxytocin\nor prolactin are increased,\nlevels of serotonin go up.\nWe can't draw a direct link\nbetween any one hormone\nsystem and acetylcholine.\nAcetylcholine kind of sits off\nin a category of its own in that way.\nBut again, in general,\ntestosterone and dopamine\ntend to collaborate in the same direction.\nCortisol and epinephrine\ntend to collaborate\nin the same direction.\nOxytocin and prolactin,\nwhich are hormones,\nand serotonin tend to collaborate\nin the same direction.\nAnd then we have poor\nold, lonely acetylcholine\noff on its own, but it's\nnot poor and lonely.\nIt actually has incredibly\npotent effects on its own.\nSo it's really that it\njust doesn't mean much help\nfrom the hormone systems\nor at least not the\nsteroid hormone systems\nin order to have its tremendous effects.\nNow a lot of what people think about\nand will do when trying\nto improve mental health\nand physical health\nis they will try and increase\nor decrease certain categories of hormones\nof the sort that I mentioned,\ntestosterone, estrogen,\noxytocin, and prolactin, so on.\nBut oftentimes, the effects\nof those manipulations\nin hormones that are\ngoing to be most salient\nare not going to be due\nto the direct effects\nof those hormones.\nSometimes it could be.\nBut oftentimes it's going\nto be due to their effects\non the brain and nervous system\nby way of how those hormones\nimpact neuromodulators.\nSo for instance,\nthere are various things\nthat people can do,\nboth men and women,\nto increase their\ntestosterone and estrogen\nin the appropriate ratios.\nI talked about one such\napproach in a previous episode,\nand that is to get sunlight\nonto a large portion\nof one's skin each day.\nBelieve it or not, this actually works.\nAnd it works because your skin\nis actually an endocrine organ,\na hormone secreting organ.\nIt's a beautiful study.\nI've covered it on this podcast before.\nWe will provide a link\nto this study again,\nbut it had people spend\nat least 20 minutes or so,\ncloser to 30 minutes, each day,\ntrying to maximize sunlight exposure\nto as much of their skin as they could\nin terms of still\nmaintaining decent exposure,\nmeaning not over exposing\nthemselves in a cultural way,\nmeaning wearing enough\nclothes that they were decent,\nbut still getting a lot of sun exposure,\na couple of times per week or more.\nWhat they found was that\npeople's testosterone\nand estrogen levels went up.\nFeelings of well-being went up.\nFeelings of well, or I should\nsay increases in libido\nwere observed, as well.\nThey subjectively reported\nmore passion, et cetera,\ntestosterone and estrogen\ndid indeed both go up.\nAnd again, I want to highlight\nthat increases in estrogen,\nnot just testosterone,\nare related to increases in\nlibido in both men and women.\nThis is why you never want\nto crush your estrogen down to zero,\nwhether or not you're male or female,\nif you want to maintain\nsome sort of healthy libido\nand general feelings of\nwell-being, unrelated to libido.\nWell, many of those effects\nwe know are not due to direct effects\nof testosterone and estrogen,\nbut rather are due to the effects\nof testosterone and estrogen\non the neuromodulators,\ndopamine and serotonin,\nbecause much of libido\nand feelings of well-being\nand feelings of relaxation,\nbut also desire, motivation, et cetera,\noriginate because of the\nactivation of neural circuits\nthat dopamine controls and promotes\nand that serotonin promote and control.\nSo this is very important to understand\nas we move toward more specific discussion\nof the chemicals that\nwe call neuromodulators,\nbecause hormones are controlling\nthose neuromodulators\nin a very slow modulatory way.\nSo yes, I said it,\nhormones modulate neuromodulators.\nI sort of said it twice on purpose.\nAnd this is a dramatic and potent effect.\nSo I'll just give you one more example.\nThe hormone prolactin\ntends to be antagonistic.\nIt tends to reduce amounts of dopamine\nor at least when\nprolactin levels are high,\ndopamine levels tend to be lower.\nYou observe this after\nthe birth of a new child,\nyou observe this post\ncoitally after mating,\nin all species, humans and animals.\nWhen prolactin is elevated,\nserotonin tends to be elevated.\nAnd when prolactin is elevated,\nlevels of dopamine and\nthe effects of dopamine\ntend to subside.\nNow as I move toward explaining\nwhat each of the four categories\nof neuromodulators do,\nthis will start to make\nmore and more sense\nas to why this would be.\nI always say I wasn't\nconsulted in the design phase,\nmeaning I didn't design these circuits.\nAnd if anyone tells you that they did,\nyou should back away quickly\nbecause none of us design these circuits.\nThis is the way that evolution\nand nature created these systems.\nAnd they tend to work in\na bit of a seesaw fashion,\nprolactin up, dopamine down, right?\nDopamine up, prolactin down.\nIn general, that is the way they work.\nSo if we are to take a\nlook at how each of these\nneuromodulator systems\nfunctions on its own,\nwhile understanding that\nthey never truly function on their own,\nwe can start to really make sense\nof the landscape of tools\nthat are available to us\nand which tools are going to\nbe most powerful to select\nif our goal is for instance, to be focused\nor if our goal is to be less stressed\nor if our goal is to be highly motivated\nand highly focused for sake of learning.\nAll of that is indeed possible\nif you understand these\nfour neuromodulators\nand you understand that\nwhile there are many tools\nranging from pharmacologic to behavioral\nthat can tap into these\nneuromodulator systems,\nthat can kind of press\non the gas of dopamine,\npull back on serotonin and so on,\nbut that there are particular tools,\nboth behavioral and supplementation-based,\nand to some extent,\nprescription drug based, too,\nand we'll touch on a few of those.\nIf you understand that and why they work,\nwell, then you can create a sort of kit,\na grab bag of things that\nyou can use in any context\nor I should say that you can look to\ndepending on the context you're in\nand create the states of\nbody and mind that you want.\nNow once again, painting\nwith a somewhat broad brush,\nbut nonetheless, an accurate brush,\nwe can say that dopamine,\nwhen elevated above baseline,\ntends to increase states of motivation,\nboth mental and physical motivation,\ndrive and to some extent focus.\nI've said it many times\nbefore, and I'll say it again,\nthere's a lot of\nmisconception about dopamine.\nMany people out there think that dopamine\nis all about pleasure.\nYou hear about dopamine hits\nor people chasing dopamine\nor the need to have a\ndopamine fast, et cetera.\nDopamine is not about pleasure.\nDopamine is about motivation,\ncraving and pursuit\nfor goals or for things that are outside\nour immediate possession and experience.\nThe motivation and pursuit of a mate.\nThe motivation and pursuit to mate.\nThe motivation and pursuit of food.\nThe motivation and\npursuit of a career goal,\net cetera, et cetera,\nthings we do not yet\nhave, but that we want\nand we get into sort of\na forward center of mass\nand a pursuit of, and that\npursuit can be physical.\nThat pursuit can be cognitive.\nIt can be both cognitive and physical.\nAnd it can involve talking\nabout something, right?\nBecause in some professions,\npursuit of things involves talking.\nI think about lawyers,\nthey talk a lot in\npursuit of winning cases\nand money, et cetera,\nputting people in jail or\nkeeping people out of jail,\net cetera, that's done with their mouths,\nnot with their bodies.\nAthletes in a state of motivated training\nor in motivated competition\nuse their bodies.\nAll this is obvious of course,\nbut perhaps what is not so obvious\nis that one molecule not working alone,\nbut predominantly one molecule, dopamine,\nis responsible for all of\nthose motivated states,\nwhich again, underscores the\npower of these neuromodulators.\nSo dopamine, we can think of\nat least in the context\nof today's discussion\nas controlling and indeed\npromoting motivation,\ndrive and pursuit\nand to some extent, focus.\nEpinephrine and a closely related molecule\ncalled norepinephrine\nand again, I want to emphasize\nthat epinephrine is adrenaline\nand adrenaline is epinephrine.\nNorepinephrine is noradrenaline\nand noradrenaline is norepinephrine,\nbut today we're going to\njust simply talk about\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.\nThat category of neuromodulator\nis mainly responsible for\ngenerating our energy,\nour level of fuel\nand baseline level of\nforward center of mass,\nas I like to call it.\nYou can also think of it\nas how high your RPM are.\nNow we're not a car\nand the car analogy sort of falls apart\nas we go further into the biology,\nbut it's a decent one for now.\nWhen epinephrine levels are high,\nwe tend to feel agitated,\nwe tend to feel like we want to move,\nwe tend to feel like we\ncan't shut down our thinking\nand our anticipation of\nwhat's going to happen next.\nAnd when epinephrine\nlevels are very, very low,\nwe actually have less physical energy.\nWe tend to have less mental energy\nin terms of generating\nthoughts very quickly\nand so on and so forth.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\ndopamine and epinephrine\nare closely related\nso much so that we know for a fact\nthat epinephrine is actually manufactured\nfrom the molecule dopamine.\nSo that's why I'm talking\nabout these two neuromodulators\nin very close juxtaposition\nbecause they do indeed\ncollaborate with one another.\nBut for sake of today's discussion,\nwe can just think of epinephrine\nas increasing energy,\nadrenaline increases energy\nin our state of readiness.\nIt also, I should mention,\nactivates our immune system.\nContrary to popular belief\nthat stress inhibits our immune system,\nepinephrine is deployed,\nit's released at great\nlevels in our brain and body\nwhen we are stressed.\nAnd that actually protects us\nagainst infections of multiple kinds,\nat least in the short-term.\nThat and all the details of that\nand tools related to that\nwere covered in our episode\non the immune system,\nif you want to check that out.\nNow the neuromodulator serotonin\ncreates a number of different\nstates in the brain and body,\nbut for sake of today's discussion,\nwe're going to think about\nthe predominant states\nthat it creates\nand those are states of contentness,\nbeing happy, feeling fairly relaxed,\nfeeling soothed and to some extent,\neven some relief from\npain or lack of pain.\nSerotonin is associated\nwith a feeling of satiety\nof having enough of what we already have.\nNow when serotonin is very, very high,\npeople can even be sedate.\nThey can be completely amotivated,\nno motivation to seek out things\nlike food or sex or work or et cetera.\nWhereas when serotonin\nlevels are very low,\npeople can actually exhibit agitation\nand high levels of stress.\nSo the levels matter here,\nbut again, for sake of\ntoday's conversation,\nwhen we leverage serotonin,\nwe are really leveraging a neuromodulator\nthat tends to increase the activity\nof neural circuits in the brain and body\nthat make us feel relaxed and happy.\nAnd it tends to decrease the\nactivity of neural circuits\nthat make us rabidly in pursuit of things\nthat we don't have, right.\nThe opposite of content and sated\nis motivation, desire\nand hunger and thirst\nfor things that we don't have.\nSo serotonin is the molecule of peace.\nIt is the molecule of contentness.\nIt is the molecule of having enough,\nat least for the time being\nor the feeling that we have\nenough for the time being.\nNow acetylcholine is a fourth\ncategory of neuromodulator\nthat as I mentioned earlier,\nis somewhat not totally,\nbut somewhat distinct\nfrom any direct control\nby the major hormone systems of the body,\nor at least the major\nsteroid hormone systems.\nAnd acetylcholine we can say\nis mainly associated with states of focus.\nAnd we can go a step further and say\nthat it's mainly associated\nwith steps of focus\nas they relate to learning\nand encoding new information,\nso called neuroplasticity.\nNow neuroplasticity,\nor the brain and nervous\nsystem's ability to change\nin response to experience\ncan be impacted by an enormous number\nof different chemicals,\nnot just acetylcholine,\nbut acetylcholine has a\nparticularly potent ability\nto open up the thing that\nwe call neuroplasticity\nto allow plasticity to\nhappen in one moment\nwhereas in a previous moment,\nit could not occur\nbecause acetylcholine had not\nbeen released in the brain\nor in the spinal cord.\nSo acetylcholine is involved\nin focus and in learning,\nbut it is not necessarily\nalways associated\nwith learning in the\ncontext of highly motivated,\nreally ramped up states.\nIt can be,\nbut acetylcholine can also be released\nand can encourage the learning\nand neuroplasticity\nassociated with calm states.\nFor instance, if somebody\nhas a newborn child,\nwe know that they are\nflooded with oxytocin,\nwhich has actually even\nbeen called the love hormone\nor it does many things in\naddition to control feelings\nof romantic attachment\nand attachment to children, et cetera.\nIt does all of that, but it\ndoes a lot more, as well.\nBut when people have a new child,\nthey also tend to be\nhyper-focused on that child,\nnot just its well-being,\nbut they narrow all their thinking,\nall their vision,\nall their hearing to that child\nand there are obvious adaptive reasons\nfor wanting to do that.\nI recall a family dinner we had.\nGosh, this was over 10 years ago.\nWe had a couple over.\nMy mom was in the habit\nof inviting people over\nwho didn't have places\nto go on the holidays,\n'cause that's just who she is\nand I think it's quite nice.\nSo she brought over this\ncouple, they had a newborn,\nI think this baby had been born\nmaybe two or three weeks before\nand it was seated or not seated [laughs].\nIt was lying down.\nI couldn't see it.\nIt was like a potato bug.\nIt could barely hold its head up.\nBut it was lying in a\nlittle bassinet on the floor\nas we ate dinner.\nAnd it was almost hilarious,\nit actually was hilarious.\nWe laughed a lot about this,\nthat the entire meal,\nthey were basically staring at this baby.\nThey were so clearly in love with the baby\nand so flooded with\noxytocin and also prolactin\nthat they couldn't take\ntheir focus off this baby.\nIt was actually really\nwonderful and endearing to see.\nBut in addition to that,\nI'd be willing to bet\nhad I been able to do a\nlittle bit of microdialysis,\nwhich is a ability to\nmeasure the amounts of neuromodulator\ngiven location in the brain,\nhad I been able to do\nthat experiment on them\nin that moment, I\nwould've found that levels\nof acetylcholine were exceedingly high\nbecause they were so\nhyper-focused on this child,\nnot just in love with,\nbut focused on that child.\nAnd without a doubt,\nthe neural circuits related to focus\nand plasticity were heavily engaged\nagain for obvious adaptive\nreasons related to child rearing\nand learning the coos and cries\nand pain signals and pleasure\nsignals of one's offspring.\nSo we have dopamine\nassociated with motivation,\ndrive and pursuit and\nto some extent, focus.\nWe have epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine associated\nwith energy of having a\nforward center of mass,\nmentally and or physically.\nWe have serotonin,\nwhich is associated with a peaceful,\ncontent, sated state of being.\nAnd we have acetylcholine,\nwhich is associated with focus\nand in particular focus\nas it relates to learning\nand encoding new information.\nSo let's say you want\nto be more motivated.\nYou want to be more in pursuit of goals.\nAnd you want to have more\nenergy and to be more focused.\nThere are many ways to go about that.\nIn fact, there's a near\ninfinite cloud of opportunities,\neverything from prescription\ndrugs to illicit drugs,\nwhich I certainly do not recommend,\nsupplements, nutrition.\nYou can listen to particular music.\nYou can do all sorts of\ncognitive behavioral,\nnutritional supplementation tricks.\nOr you can just understand\nthat what you're really after\nare increases in dopamine\nabove baseline that you control\nand there are ways to control\nthem that are quite potent\nand science tells us which tools\nare going to be the most potent\nand the most versatile for you.\nSo I'm going to share\nthose tools with you now\nwith the caveat that\neach one of those tools\ncould be its own entire podcast episode,\nand that we've done near entire episodes\non each of these tools or small\ncollections of these tools.\nSo I'm going to cover these in\nsomewhat superficial manner.\nWe can provide links to previous episodes\nthat relate to each of\nthese tools in detail,\nbut I'll give you enough detail about them\nthat would allow you to\nincorporate them into your routine\nshould you choose.\nLet's say you want to increase dopamine\nfor sake of increasing motivation.\nThe first thing to do is\nto understand what the\nnatural behavioral tools are\nfor increasing dopamine\nand to do those as\nconsistently as possible.\nAgain, these are tools\nthat you'll want to do\nnearly every day, if not every day.\nAnd I know I'm sounding like\na broken record on this one,\nbut here again, we come to sunlight\nand I should say,\nnot just the desire to,\nbut really the need\nfor viewing the maximum amount of sunlight\nthat one can reasonably get\ngiven schedules and\nlocations in the world,\ntime of year, et cetera,\nin the early part of the day,\nwithin the first hour of waking, ideally,\nbut certainly in the first\nthree hours of your day,\nyou are going to want to\nmaximize sunlight exposure\nto your eyes.\nNever look at the sun or\nany other light so bright\nthat it's painful to look at.\nAnd yes, of course blinking is fine,\nbut no, take sunglasses off,\ngo outside once the sun is out\nand get some natural light in your eyes.\nAnd if it's appropriate\nor I should say in a\nway that's appropriate,\nmaximize the amount of\nsunlight exposure to your skin,\nbut please don't get burned.\nPlease do wear sunscreen if\nyou're prone to getting burned.\nTypically early day sunlight\nis not going to burn you,\nat least not most people,\nunless you're extremely fair-skinned.\nSo don't get burned.\nDo what you need to in order\nto protect yourself from burn.\nThere's some emerging\ncontroversy about sunscreen\nand which ones are safe\nand which ones aren't safe.\nWe have not done an episode on that yet,\nbut I find it to be an\nimportant and interesting topic.\nDarya Rose, Dr. Darya Rose, I should say,\nhas a podcast called\nThe Darya Rose Podcast\nand did an episode all about sunscreens,\nwhich are safe, which are not safe,\nby interviewing an expert on that\nso I refer you to that podcast\nas it relates to sunscreen.\nBut get some natural light\nexposure in your eyes.\nAnd if you wake up\nbefore the sun comes out,\nturn on as many bright lights inside\nas you can turn on reasonably\ngiven your electric bill, et cetera.\nGet a lot of bright sunlight\nexposure early in the day\nand get a lot of sunlight\nexposure to your skin\nin the early part of the day,\nin a way that doesn't burn you,\nmeaning burn your skin\nor blind you, please.\nPlease don't do anything\nthat harms your vision\nlike stare into a bright\nlight, that's painful.\nWhat does that do?\nWell, it sets in motion a number\nof different biological cascades.\nSome are very fast.\nThere are fast actions of sunlight\nthat will trigger for instance,\ndopamine release from\ndifferent parts of your brain\nand your endocrine system.\nAnd we now know that it\nincreases levels of genes\nrelated to thyroid hormone\nand actually increases\ncertain dopamine receptors.\nSo there's a wonderful paper.\nWe will provide a link to this paper\nthat shows that sunlight exposure\ncan actually increase the\namount of so-called DRD4.\nThis is a particular type\nof dopamine receptor,\nthe dopamine receptor four.\nThe genes for dopamine receptor four\nare actually under photic control.\nSo if you get sunlight\nexposure to your eyes\nand it does have to be to your eyes\nin the early part of the day,\nyou increase the amount of\ndopamine receptor that you have,\nwhich allows whatever circulating dopamine\nhappens to be there\nto have a greater effect on motivation\nand I should say also on mood and feelings\nof being in pursuit and generally,\nin craving and pursuit of things in life.\nNow there's another way\nto increase the effect\nof whatever dopamine\nhappens to be circulating\nin your brain and body.\nAnd this again, relates\nto increasing the number\nor the efficacy of the\nreceptors for dopamine.\nNow here we're not talking about\nthe dopamine receptor four,\nbut a different category\nof dopamine receptors,\nthe D2 and D3 receptors,\nwhich are expressed multiple\nplaces in your brain and body\nand bind dopamine,\nmeaning dopamine parks in\nthem like a parking spot\nand allows dopamine\nto generally increase the\nactivity of the neurons\nand cells that express\nthose dopamine receptors.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, turns out that regular\ningestion of caffeine\nat safe and appropriate levels,\nabout a hundred to 250 milligrams\nis going to increase the number of D2\nand D3 dopamine receptors.\nI talked a little bit about\nthis on a previous episode.\nAgain, we'll provide\nlinks to these studies,\nbut this is an important finding,\nI believe, because this\nis not about the acute,\nthe immediate effects of\ncaffeine on alertness,\nalthough those occur, too.\nWhen you drink caffeine,\nit's going to increase\nyour levels of adrenaline\nand so-called epinephrine,\nwhich will increase your energy levels.\nIt's going to decrease levels\nof something called adenosine,\nwhich builds up while you're sleepy.\nIt's going to make you feel\nless sleepy, more alert,\nmore energetic.\nThat's sort of obvious.\nBut what's less obvious is\nthat it's increasing the number\nand efficacy of dopamine receptors\nso that whatever dopamine\nhappens to be around\nin your system is going to\nhave more of a potent effect.\nSo how much caffeine should you drink?\nThat's going to vary\nfrom person to person.\nSome people are very sensitive\nto caffeine, others are not.\nI tend to be fairly\ninsensitive to caffeine,\n'cause I've been drinking it\nfor a long period of time.\nBut you know, after one or two\ncups of espresso or coffee,\nI feel like I've had enough.\nI tend to drink my\ncaffeine early in the day,\nwhich is what I'm going\nto recommend that you do,\nnot drinking caffeine past\ntwo and certainly not 4:00 PM,\nif you're on a typical schedule\nand you want to be able\nto sleep that night,\neven if you can fall asleep.\nHaving too much caffeine\nin your system is not good\nbecause it disrupts the\narchitecture of sleep.\nAnd now knowing about all\nthe metabolic variability\nacross the night, according\nto different stages of sleep,\nit should be even more obvious\nas to why disrupting the\narchitecture of sleep\nwould be bad for you.\nSo limit that caffeine\nintake to early in the day\nand don't go ballistic.\nCertainly don't go ballistic in any case,\nbut for most people anywhere\nfrom 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine\nis going to have this effect.\nAnd this effect again is\na slow accumulating effect\nby drinking caffeine\nconsistently day-to-day.\nI get my caffeine mainly\nfrom Yerba Mate tea.\nI want to emphasize that\nit's probably a good idea\nto stay away from the smoked mates.\nThere's some evidence\nthose can be carcinogenic,\nbut I brew my own Yerba Mate tea,\nor sometimes I'll drink\ncoffee or espresso,\nor sometimes both frankly,\nas long as I'm hydrating enough\nand I'm getting enough salt,\nthen I tend to feel fine\nwith that much caffeine.\nThe other way to increase dopamine\nand to make sure that your\nbaseline levels of dopamine\nare high enough is to make sure\nthat you're eating sufficient numbers\nof tyrosine-rich foods.\nYou can look up which\nfoods include tyrosine.\nTyrosine is a precursor to dopamine.\nIt's an amino acid that\nis in direct pathway\nto dopamine synthesis\nand tyrosine foods include things like\ncertain meats, Parmesan cheese,\nvery high in tyrosine, for instance.\nIn fact, there's something\ncalled the cheese effect,\nbelieve it or not.\nI don't want to go too far off topic,\nbut the cheese effect\nis kind of interesting\nbecause certain people\nwill take antidepressants\nthat are so called MAO inhibitors,\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors.\nAnytime you hear ASE, that's an enzyme.\nThey will take these inhibitors\nthat prevent the breakdown of dopamine\nand other so-called catacholamines,\nwhich allow more dopamine\nto be in circulation.\nBut if these people eat certain cheeses,\nincluding Parmesan cheese,\nand there are other foods,\nof course that include not just tyrosine,\nbut one of the derivatives of tyrosine,\ncalled tyramine,\nthat generates what's\ncalled the cheese effect,\nwhich is people get potent migraines,\nheadaches, blood pressure goes up.\nWhy, well, because they've\ngot a lot of tyrosine\nin their system and\ndopamine in their system.\nAnd they've got less of the enzyme\nthat removes that dopamine\nor limits its action\nand so they have an excess of dopamine\nand dopamine has effects on\nblood pressure, et cetera.\nSo the cheese effect is something to avoid\nif you are somebody who's taking drugs\nthat tap into or manipulate\nthe dopamine pathway,\neither for Parkinson's or depressions,\nobviously you're going\nto want to be careful\nabout adjusting up or down\nlevels of dopamine too potently.\nSo mind the cheese effect\nif you're taking an MAO inhibitor.\nThere's a lot of information\nabout this online.\nFor most people, eating\nfoods like Parmesan cheese,\neating foods like certain\nmeats and certain vegetables\nalso can increase tyrosine levels,\nwhich will increase dopamine synthesis.\nSo these are ways of\nmodulating, more or less,\nthe baseline of dopamine\nthat you are able to produce\nand the ways that dopamine\ncan have its action\nby way of binding to\nreceptors more potently.\nNow there are other ways\nto increase dopamine\nin a more acute or directed way,\nways to spike your dopamine,\nto enhance your state of\nmotivation, mood, focus and so on.\nAnd in thinking about the\nvast landscape of tools\nthat can do that,\nwe have one category of tools,\nwhich are the really, really bad things\nthat I don't recommend anybody do.\nIn fact, I recommend nobody do ever,\nwhich are things like cocaine,\nmethamphetamine, et cetera.\nThey are incredibly destructive for lives\nbecause of the way that they\nso potently increase dopamine\nand then the crash in\ndopamine that occurs later.\nI mean, they can indeed\nand often do ruin lives.\nSo we're leaving those off the table.\nThere are of course, prescription\ndrugs that many people,\nespecially people who have\nclinically diagnosed ADHD,\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,\nrely on and in fact\nbenefit from in many cases,\nthings like Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse.\nNowadays, there's also\na lot of interest in use\nof things like Modafinil, Armodafinil.\nI covered all of those\nin the episode on ADHD.\nAnd you can find that on HubermanLab.com\nand the other places\nthis podcast is found.\nPrescription drugs aside because\nthey require a prescription\nand a discussion that's in-depth\nand appropriate with your\nphysician, healthcare provider.\nThere are supplements\nthat can very potently\nincrease dopamine as well,\nperhaps not to the extent\nthat some of those other\nprescription drugs can,\nbut certainly to a degree that will impact\nand increase dopamine and motivation\nand the other states\ndopamine is associated with.\nAnd the two main categories of supplements\nthat are very effective\nin raising dopamine\nand here I should provide the caveat\nthat anytime you're going\nto add or remove anything\nfrom your supplementation protocols,\nplease talk to a physician\nwho is knowledgeable on these topics.\nIf you're somebody who has,\nor is taking drugs for\ndepression or mania,\nplease be very cautious about\nmanipulating your dopamine\nin any case.\nI don't just say that to protect us,\nI say that to protect you.\nBut if we were to look at\nthe supplement landscape\nand ask which supplement\nincreased dopamine,\nthere are a vast number of them,\nbut the three main ones,\nthe most effective ones that\nare readily available out there\nwithout a prescription\nare mucuna pruriens.\nThis is actually the\noutside of a velvety bean\nthat has been extracted\nand put into a supplement.\nMucuna pruriens is actual L-dopa.\nIt's 99% L-dopa, which\nis a prescription drug\nthat is given for Parkinson's\nand for other purposes\nwhere increasing dopamine is important.\nI don't recommend mucuna pruriens.\nI'm not saying that no one should take it,\nbut I don't take it.\nAnd I don't recommend it\nbecause it tends to so potently\nand acutely increase dopamine,\nthat there's a pretty\nsubstantial crash afterwards.\nSo I avoid it and I\ndon't generally suggest\nthat anyone take it unless\nthere's really a clinical need,\nor they're working very\nclosely with somebody\nthat can really monitor that.\nThe other two supplements\nthat can increase dopamine\nin a short-term way,\nbut in a significant way,\nare L-tyrosine\nso you can buy that as\na supplement amino acid.\nI sometimes take this.\nI would say, I probably take\nit about once a week maximum\nfor work bouts or workouts.\nI'll take it in dosages of anywhere\nfrom 500 milligrams to\na thousand milligrams.\nPeople vary tremendously\nin their sensitivity\nto supplementing L-tyrosine.\nI know people that can take two grams.\nI know people that can barely\ntake a hundred milligrams.\nI know people that the best dose for them\nis zero milligrams.\nSo there's a lot of variation\nthere depending on sensitivity\nand they're natural\nbaseline levels of dopamine\nand whether or not they're\ndoing a lot of other things\nto support dopamine,\nbut nonetheless, taking\nL-tyrosine will lead\nto fairly substantial\nincreases in dopamine\nwithin about 15 to 45 minutes\nand it lasts for about\n30 minutes to two hours\nand then there's kind of a tapering off.\nSome people experience a\nlittle bit of an emotional\nand or I should say energetic\ncrash, some people don't.\nAnd then the other supplement\nthat I certainly use,\nand that I know a number\nof other people use\nis more fast-acting, but more potent,\nwhich is phenylethylamine.\nThis relates to the\nso-called PEA molecule,\nPEA, P-E-A,\nand phenylethylamine increases dopamine\nand some metabolites related to dopamine\nin ways that really increase energy\nand feelings of well-being and motivation.\nAnd again, it's fast-acting.\nSo my particular protocol,\nthe one I use is I'll\ntake phenylethylamine\nat dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams\nalong with some L-tyrosine,\nor I'll take it on its\nown with a molecule,\nor I should say a compound\nthat we'll talk about a little bit later\nas it relates to acetylcholine, Alpha-GPC,\nbut tyrosine and phenylethylamine\ntaken alone or together\nwill make you feel more\nmotivated and more alert,\nmore willing and able to lean into\nparticular motivated behaviors,\nwhether or not they're\nphysical or cognitive.\nIf you'd like to learn\nmore about these compounds\nand their supplementation\nand their effects,\nI encourage you to check out\nthe ever valuable website, examine.com.\nIt's zero cost to access,\nand they provide references\nand some more details\nabout these sorts of compounds\nand other related compounds.\nNow if we are going to\nlook at behavioral tools\nfor potently increasing dopamine,\nthat too is a vast landscape.\nAnd we know based on hundreds,\nif not thousands of studies\nthat things like winning\nat some sort of competition\nor succeeding in reaching a goal\ncan certainly increase dopamine.\nWe talk a lot about this in the episode\non dopamine, motivation and drive,\nbut leaving that aside,\nthere are certain behavioral protocols\nthat are unrelated to your\noverall goals and motivations\nthat can increase dopamine\nin a very sustained way.\nAnd without question,\nthe most potent behavioral\ntool for doing that\nis going to be deliberate, cold exposure.\nDeliberate cold exposure has\nbeen talked about a lot here\nand elsewhere in terms of its\nability to do things\nlike reduce inflammation\nas a way to test and improve resilience\nbecause uncomfortable cold,\nprovided its applied safely\nis a great way to learn\nto be more resilient\nbecause you're essentially\nstaying or forcing yourself\nto stay in a circumstance\nwhere your system is\nflooded with adrenaline.\nBut one lesser known aspect\nof deliberate cold exposure\nis one that's been demonstrated\nquite convincingly in humans,\ncomes from a study\npublished in the year 2000.\nI'll link to this study.\nI love this study by the way.\nCovered it many times on this podcast\nbecause I love it so much and\nI think it's truly important.\nAnd that's the study from Srámek et al,\nentitled, \"Human physiological responses\n\"to immersion into water\nof different temperatures\".\nI'm not going to go into\nthis into a ton of detail\nfor sake of time,\nbut basically what they show is that\nputting people into cold water,\nand I should mention\nthe water that they used\nin this study wasn't that cold.\nThey had a bunch of different conditions,\nbut they had people that\ngot into, for instance,\n60 degree Fahrenheit\nwater for up to two hours,\nhad them sitting there,\nhad them in a lawn chair up to their neck,\nhad very long sustained increases\nin dopamine transmission\nand dopamine circulation\nin their brain and body.\nAnd also some of the other catacholamines,\nas I mentioned before,\ndopamine tends to\ncollaborate with epinephrine\nand vice versa.\nNow you don't need to put yourself\ninto 60 degree Fahrenheit water\nto get these kind of sustained increases.\nAnd you certainly don't\nneed to do it for two hours.\nWe have a strong reason to believe\nbased on subsequent studies,\nin fact, published just this last year,\nthat getting into much colder water\nof say 50 degrees or 55 degrees\nor even 45 degrees Fahrenheit\ncan potently increase dopamine\nand epinephrine, as well.\nAnd that you don't need to expose yourself\nto that cold water for nearly as long.\nSo perhaps even as short as\none minute or even 30 seconds\nexposure to really cold water,\ncan lead to these potent\nlong-lasting increases in dopamine.\nMany people will ask\nwhich protocols to follow.\nFor instance, will a cold shower suffice?\nVery likely, yes, if your\nshower gets cold enough.\nDo you need ice floating in the bath?\nNo, it's all about the temperature\nnot whether or not there's\nice present or not.\nHow long to stay in there?\nThere are a lot of details\nthat we don't have time\nto go into this episode.\nPlease see the episode on\nthe Use of Deliberate Cold\nfor Health and Performance.\nYou'll find that at HubermanLab.com.\nWe have a newsletter related to this.\nIt gets into a lot of detailed protocols,\nbut in general, we can say\nthat the way to evoke dopamine\nand epinephrine release\nusing cold water is to\nideally you would do cold water immersion.\nIf you can't, you'd use cold shower,\nbut you want to use a\ntemperature that is safe,\nmeaning you're not going\nto have a heart attack,\nbut that is uncomfortable\nsuch that you really want to get out\nand then staying in for\nanywhere from one minute\nto 10 minutes, depending on\nhow cold adapted you are,\nand then getting out\nand drying off and going about your day,\nunless you have some other protocol\nthat you're trying to\nextract from the cold.\nSo this is a cold exposure protocol\nspecifically aimed at increasing dopamine.\nFor some people out there, you might think\nthis is kind of silly using\ncold water to increase dopamine.\nBut when you look at the data in humans\non the effect of cold water exposure\nto stimulate long-lasting,\nvery significant increases\nin dopamine and epinephrine,\nI think you'll agree that\nthis is a really potent tool\nthat provided its given\nsafely and gone about safely,\nis giving you the kinds\nof increases in dopamine\nthat you would seek using\nprescription pharmacology.\nNow it shouldn't be used as a replacement\nfor prescription pharmacology,\nalthough people have done that to success.\nOne of the previous guest\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwas Dr. Anna Lembke, our director\nof the Dual Diagnosis\nAddiction Clinic at Stanford.\nShe has an amazing book\ncalled \"Dopamine Nation\",\nall about dopamine and\nboth its uses, healthy,\nand its perils in things like addiction.\nAnd she describes a patient of hers\nthat used deliberate cold exposure\nto try and maintain dopamine levels\nwhile coming off of drugs\nthat were increasing dopamine so potently\nthat they were putting him\ndown the path of addiction.\nSo the use of cold water\nfor increasing dopamine\nis a real tool.\nIt's, I would say, a power tool.\nIn fact, it's the kind\nof thing that if you want\nto increase dopamine\nfor sake of motivation,\nit might be your first go-to\nprovided you're also doing the things\nto maintain dopamine baseline\nlike sunlight exposure in particular,\nmaking sure you're\ngetting sufficient amounts\nof tyrosine-containing foods and so on.\nAnd now just very briefly,\nI want to point to a few quick tools\nthat good peer review data tell us\ncan be leveraged in order to make sure\nthat you have sufficient\ndopamine when you want it\nor that it's available\nfor it to be released\nby any number of the\ntools I provided thus far.\nAnd those are sufficient\nnumber of B vitamins.\nSo it turns out that B vitamins,\nin particular B6 or vitamin B6,\ncan potently reduce prolactin levels.\nAnd again, prolactin and\ndopamine tend to work\nin kind of push pull fashion.\nThat said you should be cautious\nabout taking excessive levels of B6.\nIt is a vitamin that if you take too much,\nyou'll likely excrete\nit through your urine,\nbut there is evidence that having\nexcessively high levels of B6\nor supplementing with\nexcessively high levels of B6\ncan cause some peripheral neuropathy,\nsome death of nerves in the periphery.\nIf you want to know what dosage\nlevels are relevant there\njust simply look it up online.\nThere's a lot of information about this.\nBut you do want to make sure\nthat you're getting\nenough B6, B12, et cetera,\nsuch that you can keep\nprolactin levels in check.\nAnd if you suspect that you\nhave a dopamine deficiency,\nplease talk to your doctor\nand talk to them about\nways you might adjust\nthat prolactin down and\nthereby dopamine up.\nThe other way to ensure that\ndopamine levels stay high\nor put differently,\nthat you don't quash whatever dopamine\nyou have in your system\nis to really avoid bright\nlight exposure to your eyes\nbetween the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM\nor another way of putting this\nbecause I realize people sleep\nat different times, et cetera,\nis to avoid bright light\nexposure to your eyes,\nnot just blue light,\nbut all colors of light\nin phase three, that is 17\nto 24 hours after waking up\nbecause that's really\nwhen you should be asleep\nor trying to get asleep, if\nyou're having trouble sleeping.\nWork from Samer Hattar's lab,\nthe director of the chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health,\nagain, a previous Huberman\nLab Podcast guest,\ntell us that bright light exposure\nin phase three of your circadian cycle,\n17 to 24 hours after waking,\ncan have dramatic effects\nin reducing dopamine levels\nby way of activating a neural circuit\ninvolving something called the habenula.\nI don't want to get into\ntoo many details right now,\nbut really try and keep the lights dim\nin the middle of the night or off,\nif you can do that safely.\nIt's really going to help\nif you're turning on your phone brightly,\nif you are turning on bright lights,\nit's not just going to\nnegatively impact melatonin,\nthe hormone that helps\nyou fall and stay asleep.\nIt's also going to negatively\nimpact dopamine levels,\nnot just that night,\nbut the subsequent day.\nSo that more or less\nsummarizes our coverage\nof ways to use behavior and\nsupplementation and nutrition\nto increase dopamine\nand dopamine receptor efficacy and number,\nand to keep sufficient amounts of dopamine\nin your system day-to-day for\nmotivation, mood and focus.\nAnd of course, keep in mind those things\nthat can suppress dopamine,\nthe bright light exposure,\nelevated prolactin, and so on.\nMy hope is that by\nunderstanding those tools\nand how they work\nand understanding that\ndopamine does certain things\nand not others\nthat you can assemble a\nversatile kit of behaviors\nand other things that you can do\nin order to adjust your dopamine levels\naccording to your particular goals.\nI want to just briefly\nreturn to the fact, however,\nthat all of that is\nriding on that phase one,\nphase two background,\nmeaning, it's probably going to\ntake less cold water exposure,\nor I should say less time\ndoing cold water exposure\nearly in the day\nto get a big increase in dopamine\nthan it would later in the day.\nBecause later in the day, your\nbaseline levels of dopamine\nare lower and you've got\nmore serotonin circulating.\nThat should make sense to you\nnow as to why that's the case.\nAnd does that mean\nthat you should really modify\nyour protocols dramatically?\nProbably not, but you\nmight keep that in mind\nthat if, for instance, you need\nto be in a highly motivated,\nfocused state in the late part of the day,\nfor whatever reason,\nit might take a few or more of these tools\nin combination in order\nto accomplish that.\nWhereas if you're somebody\nwho feels pretty good\nduring the day, but you're\nkind of lacking motivation\nand you want to increase dopamine levels\nand you don't yet need to,\nor want to resort to prescription\ndrugs or supplementation,\nwell, then you might layer in\na couple behavioral protocols\npaying attention to of course,\nthe things that you might be doing\nthat would also potentially\nsuppress dopamine.\nSo again, that kit of tools is designed\nfor you to play with, if you choose,\nif it's safe for you to\napply them, then do that.\nConsider doing them individually,\nnot trying to hit all the\ntools all at once, right?\nI mean, why throw all those tools\nat your dopamine system at once?\nBetter would be to have\nthose tools in your kit\nand be able to deploy them depending on\nwhether or not you're on travel,\nwhether or not you're\neating well or less well,\nwhether or not you're\nsleeping well or less well.\nThat's highly individual\nand I'd like to think that in\nhaving those tools in hand,\nyou'll be able to adjust them\nand apply them in the ways\nthat allow you to access\nthe dopamine increases\nthat you're after.\nSo next I'd like to\ntalk about epinephrine,\nalso called adrenaline.\nI want to point out that epinephrine\nis released both in\nthe brain and the body.\nIn fact, there's a barrier\nbetween brain and body\nthat prevents the\nepinephrine that's released\nfrom your adrenal glands,\nfrom crossing the blood brain barrier.\nSo your brain has a separate site\ncalled the locus coeruleus.\nThis is a collection of neurons\nin the back of the brain\nthat kind of sprinkler\nthe rest of the brain\nwith epinephrine\nand essentially wakes up\nwhatever neural circuits\nhappen to see, or I should say,\nwake up any circuits\nwhere that epinephrine\nhappens to arrive, right,\nand generally increase the\nexcitability of those networks.\nThat's why we say\nepinephrine increases energy.\nI'm not talking about caloric energy,\nalthough that's distantly related to this,\nbut really energy and the desire to move,\nthe feeling that we can think,\nthe feeling that we can be alert.\nIn fact, if you look at somebody\nand their eyelids are wide open,\nin large part,\nthat's because of a lot of\nadrenaline in their system.\nIf their pupils are really big\nand their eyes are really wide open,\nin general, that means they have\na lot of epinephrine circulating there,\nwhereas when we're tired\nand we're kind of hood-eyed\nand we're sort of sleepy,\nor our pupils are really small,\nin general, that's because\nlevels of epinephrine\nand also dopamine, remember\nthey work together,\nlevels of epinephrine and\ndopamine tend to be lower.\nThis is also why when\npeople take any drug,\nlike again, not recommending this,\namphetamine or cocaine or any stimulant,\ntheir pupils tend to be huge.\nTheir eyes tend to be wide open.\nThey don't blink very often.\nAnd the opposite is true\nwhen people take sedatives.\nSo it all starts to make sense\nwhen you think about the\nbasic actions of these things.\nFor many people, increasing\nadrenaline or epinephrine\nmight seem like a crazy idea.\nMost people probably associate\nthis molecule with stress\nand then would like to be less stressed.\nAnd we've done entire\nepisodes about stress,\nhow to master stress,\nhow to leverage stress,\nhow to conquer stress.\nThere are a lot of great tools to do that\nthat are behavioral,\nsupplementation-based.\nPlease see the episode on\nMastering Stress for those tools,\nbut there are people, including me,\nthat want to increase\nour levels of epinephrine\nat least early in the day.\nI'm somebody who wakes up rather slowly.\nIn fact, right after waking up,\nI rarely want to bounce out of bed.\nI try and push myself to do that.\nI'm always impressed by\nthese chakra-willy types\nthat are up at 4:30 or up at\nfive and already into action.\nI tend to be kind of thinking about\nthinking about maybe being\nin action early in the day,\nbut I try and push myself\nto get into action,\nwhich itself can increase epinephrine.\nI should mention that\nany physical activity,\nany physical activity,\nwalking, running, weight\nlifting, swimming,\neven talking for that matter\nis going to increase\nlevels of epinephrine.\nLocus coeruleus is a brain structure\nthat is tightly coupled with behaviors\nin a bidirectional way.\nThat is, when you are in action,\nyou increase the amount\nof epinephrine released\nfrom locus coeruleus.\nYou wake up the brain.\nAnd conversely, when\nlocus coeruleus is active,\nthe brain wakes up, so it's reciprocal.\nIt goes both directions.\nSo I saw a funny tweet\nactually earlier today,\nit was something like\ngoing to the gym gives you energy,\nbut you need energy to go to the gym.\nSounds like a pyramid scheme to me,\nwhich made me chuckle.\nBut of course overlooks the fact that,\nindeed, if you have energy,\nyou are more likely to be willing\nto get into physical movement\nor cognitive movement and thinking hard\nor thinking a lot about something.\nBut also it is absolutely\nscientifically proven\nthat being in action\nincreases levels of epinephrine.\nThis is why exercising early in the day\ngives you more energy for rest of day.\nYou still might experience\na little bit of a crash\nin the afternoon,\nespecially if you're\ngetting up extra early,\nor if you're drinking\ncaffeine too close to waking.\nI've talked about this before.\nIf you drink too much\ncaffeine close to waking,\nyou're going to have an afternoon crash.\nBetter to push that caffeine intake out\nabout 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\nI know this is really\npainful for certain people,\nbut caffeine does increase epinephrine.\nCaffeine does other things\nto limit sleepiness.\nAnd by pushing it out 90 to\n120 minutes after waking,\nyou will avoid the afternoon\ncrash to a large degree.\nAnd if you get up and you exercise\nor even do any movement of any kind,\na hundred jumping jacks or a\nwalk, if you can't do that,\nanything like that will increase\nthe total amount of\nepinephrine that you secrete\ninto your bloodstream and in your brain\nand will get you more energy,\nnot just in that moment,\nbut throughout the day.\nSo keep that in mind.\nExercise does indeed give you energy.\nIt burns caloric energy,\nbut it gives you neural energy\nby way of increasing\nepinephrine transmission\nfrom locus coeruleus.\nAnd presumably if the\nexercise is intense enough,\nadrenaline, epinephrine release,\nfrom the adrenals within\nyour body, as well.\nSo we have exercise and we have caffeine\nas potent tools for increasing epinephrine\nand thereby, energy.\nAnother potent tool\nthat's purely behavioral,\nbut is known to work,\nbased on excellent studies in humans.\nAnd actually my laboratory has been doing\nsimilar types of studies\nthat are soon to be published, we hope,\nis so-called cyclic hyperventilation.\nSome of you may be familiar\nwith Wim Hof breathing.\nThere's also Tummo breathing,\nwhich is very similar,\nKundalini breathing.\nAll of those styles of breathing\ninvolve cyclic hyperventilation,\ndeep inhales, and either passive\nexhales or active exhales,\nbut repeating, inhale,\nexhale, inhale, exhale,\nin a very deep and repetitive way.\nIf you were to do that right now,\ndoesn't matter if you do it\nthrough your nose or mouth,\nalthough ideally you would do\nthe inhale through your nose\nand the exhale through your mouth,\nif you did that for 25 repetitions,\n25 inhales and exhales,\nyou would feel more alert.\nYou'd also feel more warm, why?\nBecause you increased\nepinephrine, adrenaline release\nin the brain and body.\nIt works the first time\nand it works every time\nto increase epinephrine\nand thereby energy.\nAnd in fact, there are protocols\nand great scientific studies\nof using cyclic hyperventilation\nfor periods of minutes, if not longer,\nwhere for instance, you would\ndo 25 big inhales and exhales\nfollowed by a brief breath\nhold with your lungs empty,\nthen repeat 25, then brief breath hold,\nexcuse me, exhale, hold your lungs empty.\nAnd then repeat again for\na third round, if you like.\nIf you do that over and over,\nyou're going to be very alert.\nYou're going to have more energy.\nYou're going to feel like\nyou want to move around a lot more.\nIn fact, you might even feel agitated.\nSo people with a lot of anxiety\nor prone to panic attack\nmight want to be cautious\nin how they train and embark\non that type of breathing,\nmight want to approach it\na little more carefully\nor avoid it altogether.\nBut for most people,\ncyclic hyperventilation is simply going to\nget you more energized and\nfeeling like you want to move,\nfeeling like you can think more clearly,\nand you'll be more wide-eyed and alert\nbecause you are releasing adrenaline.\nAnd the cold water exposure protocol\nthat I talked about earlier\nand that's covered in our episode on cold\nand in the newsletter on cold.\nWell that, as I mentioned earlier,\npotently increases dopamine,\nbut also epinephrine.\nSo that's another terrific tool,\nwhether or not it's applied by\ncold shower or cold immersion\nor some other thing like cryo,\nthat is going to make you more alert\nbecause it releases adrenaline.\nNow we can't really say\nthat there are foods\nto increase epinephrine.\nRather, there are foods that\ninclude a lot of tyrosine\nthat will increase dopamine.\nAnd remember, dopamine is the molecule\nfrom which epinephrine is synthesized.\nSo we can't really point\nto a particular food\nor categories of food for\nincreasing epinephrine.\nI think caffeine and things like it\nwill increase epinephrine.\nThere are of course prescription drugs\nthat will increase epinephrine.\nAnd of course,\nthere are all sorts of\nso-called beta blockers\nthat will block the\nreceptors for epinephrine\nto make you feel calm for public speaking\nor for various heart\nconditions, et cetera.\nThat's really the domain of physicians\nand should really be worked\nout with your cardiologist,\nwith a physician et cetera.\nI think the tools of exercise\nand should you want very\npotent increases in adrenaline,\nhigh intensity exercise,\nas well as the tools of\ncaffeine, cyclic hyperventilation\nand deliberate cold exposure,\nreally combine to give\nyou a nice little kit,\nI would say a versatile kit,\nof ways to increase epinephrine\nfor sake of having more\nphysical and mental energy.\nSo next is the\nneuromodulator acetylcholine.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nacetylcholine is associated\nwith states of focus\nand those states of focus\ncan be high energy states of focus.\nSo the ones that are accompanied by\nhigh levels of dopamine and epinephrine\nand where we're really excited about\nand really lasered in on something,\nor they can be the calmer,\nmore relaxed states of focus\nlike reading a book or practicing music\nor listening very carefully to somebody\nin a way that's relaxed and calm.\nAnd yet nonetheless,\nwhere we have a narrow cognitive\nand typically a narrow visual aperture,\nand typically also a\nnarrow auditory aperture.\nThat is our auditory system\nand our visual system\nand our thinking can be very broad.\nIt can be all over the place.\nOr it can be very narrow.\nAnd it can be very focused.\nAcetylcholine is released from\ntwo major sites in the brain,\nnucleus basalis, which is in the forebrain\nand extends connections out\nto many different brain areas\nto offer the opportunity to\nrelease acetylcholine locally\nand more or less in a chemical way,\nhighlight those particular\nneurons and synapses\nfor strengthening, for plasticity later.\nAnd it is released from sites\nin the back of the brain\nin a way that can increase\nthe so-called fidelity\nof information coming in\nthrough our eyes, our\nears, our nose, et cetera.\nWhat do I mean by fidelity?\nWell, we are constantly being bombarded\nwith sensory information through\nall of our various senses\nand acetylcholine released from this area\nin the back of the brain,\nhas the ability to increase\nthe extent to which\nsay, visual information\nor just visual and auditory information\nwould make it through to our consciousness\nwhereas all the other types\nof sensory information\nthat are coming in are filtered out.\nSo your brain, because it's\ntaking in all this information\nneeds to decide what to pay attention to.\nAnd in this way, we can\nsay that acetylcholine\nhas a lot to do, not just\nwith \"focus\", in air quotes,\nbut literally attention,\nwhich neural signals become\nrelevant to our consciousness.\nThere's a whole discussion to be had there\nand we don't have time for that.\nRather, I'd like to focus\non what are the tools\nthat one can use\nto maintain healthy\nbaselines of acetylcholine\nand increase acetylcholine\nfor sake of learning\nany type of information,\nphysical, cognitive, or otherwise.\nNow it turns out there\nhave been a lot of studies,\nincluding many quality\npeer reviewed studies\ncarried out in humans,\nlooking at what happens\nwhen you increase acetylcholine\nlevels in the brain\nand you accompany that\nwith the attempt to learn.\nAnd what you find almost always\nis that people experience increased focus,\nthat when measured the neuronal responses\nbecome more specific,\nso less broad scale activity in the brain\nand more specific neural circuit activity\nand that this triggers immediate\nand long-lasting changes\nin the way those circuits work,\neven when acetylcholine\nis not being deployed,\nso-called neuroplasticity,\nthe circuits literally change.\nSo this is great.\nThe work of Michael Silver at Berkeley,\nthe work of Mike Merzenich at UCSF,\nthe work of Michael Kilgard down in Texas,\nall of those laboratories\nsee this again and again, and again.\nIncrease acetylcholine\nbefore and during learning.\nAnd there's a much higher probability\nthat the learning will quote, unquote,\n\"sink in\", that the\ninformation will be retained\nbecause those neural circuits change.\nNow ways to increase\nacetylcholine in a potent way\ninclude again, nutrition\nand supplementation.\nIt is important to have\nbaseline levels of acetylcholine\nbe sufficiently high, as well.\nAnd for that really the ideal situation\nis to regularly ingest\nfoods that provide enough\nof the precursors for\nacetylcholine to be made.\nIf you go online and\nyou were to do a search\nof which foods contain a lot of choline,\nwhich is related to the\nsynthesis of acetylcholine,\nyou would get some\ninteresting information back.\nFor instance, beef liver\nis the most potent source of choline.\nI know nowadays there's kind\nof a growing micro trend\nif you will, of ingesting beef liver,\neven raw liver, which to be honest,\nthe thought of ingesting\nraw liver of any kind\nactivates my area postrema,\nwhich is the area of the\nbrain that triggers nausea.\nIn fact, I'm starting to salivate a bit,\nnot because I'm hungry,\nbut I think the whole\nconcept makes me ill.\nNonetheless, cooked liver\nor raw liver for that matter,\nor liver of any kind seems\nto contain a lot of choline.\nI realize most people,\nmost people are not\ngoing to be running out\nand ingesting large amounts of beef liver.\nEggs contain a lot of choline.\nBeef contains choline.\nSoybeans contain choline.\nSo there are vegan or non-meat sources,\nchicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans,\nthese sorts of things\ncontain a lot of choline\nand there are other vegetables\nthat contain choline.\nSo depending on your dietary\npreferences and needs,\nyou can select certain foods to ingest,\nto get enough choline to synthesize\nenough baseline acetyl choline.\nIn the realm of supplementation,\nthere are some excellent tools\nfor increasing acetylcholine\nin the acute short-term,\nmeaning over the course\nof about 30 minutes\nout to about two hours\nor maybe even four hours.\nAnd the number of different\nmolecules that can do that,\nthat are available without a prescription,\nat least in the US, is pretty vast.\nThe most common of those\nmolecules is actually nicotine.\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptors\nare abundant throughout\nthe body and brain.\nThey're in various brain circuits.\nThey are on muscle and yes,\nsmoking nicotine either\nby vaping or cigarette\nwill activate those nicotinic receptors.\nBut of course, smoking\nis a terrible thing.\nIt will also activate\nthings like lung cancer.\nSo I definitely don't recommend that.\nIt also activates addiction\nbecause of the ways\nthat it triggers activation\nof the dopamine circuit.\nSo I think that triggering activation\nof acetylcholine-related\npathways by ingesting nicotine\nby way of inhalants is\ngenerally a bad idea.\nHowever, some people will chew Nicorette\nor other nicotine type gums.\nI've never done that,\nbut I have friends who\nactually rely on that.\nThese are typically former smokers\nthat are trying not to smoke,\nbut still want to get some\nof the focus enhancement\nthat they experience from nicotine.\nSome people are very\nsensitive to nicotine,\nand this is important.\nSome people are very sensitive\nto ingested nicotine.\nSo nowadays there are\nnicotine-dipped toothpicks,\nthere of course, is nicotine gum\nand other sources of nicotine.\nSome people can take that and feel fine.\nSome people take it and\nfeel absolutely terrible.\nI confess, I've never\nactually tried nicotine\nin any of those forms so I\ndon't know how they work for me,\nbut some people do use them\nas cognitive enhancers.\nIn fact, I know one Nobel\nprize winning neuroscientist,\nwho's quite well known in our field\nfor chewing Nicorette all day long.\nHe insists that it really\nhelps him with his focus\nand he is exceedingly\nsmart and productive,\nalthough I'm sure there\nare other reasons for that.\nSupplements that I have used and do use\nfor increasing acetylcholine\nare things like Alpha GPC or Huperzinene.\nAlpha GPC\nis in the choline pathway,\nsuch that more\nacetylcholine is synthesized\nafter you ingest it.\nThat's the general logic or\nframework of how it works.\nWhereas Huperzinene is mainly\nin the enzymatic pathway.\nIt tends to adjust how much\nacetylcholine is broken down\nand lead to net increases\nin acetylcholine.\nI will often take 300\nmilligrams of Alpha GPC\nprior to workouts or prior\nto cognitive work bouts.\nBut when I say often, I\ntend to do this anywhere\nfrom three to four times a\nweek, typically not every day.\nAlthough there are people\nincluding people who are trying\nto offset age-related cognitive decline,\nthat will take 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC\nthree times a day, every day,\nwhich closely mimic some of the studies\nthat have been done on humans,\nlooking at offsetting\nage-related cognitive decline,\nusing things like Alpha GPC.\nI should point out that there\nhave been a few studies,\na few, not many,\nbut these studies emphasize that people\nwho take a lot of Alpha\nGPC chronically over time\nmay be at increased risk for stroke.\nI think the data are still out on that\nand we need more data.\nBut for me, in terms of thinking\nabout the risk benefit profiles,\ntaking 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC,\nmost certainly does increase\nmy ability to focus.\nI've noticed that.\nI tend to take it alongside caffeine\nand phenylethylamine.\nSo I take that in combination\neither before workouts or workbouts,\nreally sharpens my focus.\nAnd again, I'm doing that three,\nmaybe four times per week.\nAnd I'm careful to do that\nin the early part of the day\nso that it does not disrupt my sleep.\nAlthough I have taken Alpha GPC\nin the second half of the day,\nand I had no trouble sleeping at all.\nI don't know what the exact\nhalf life is of the given form\nthat's typically in supplementation.\nIt's actually hard to\nget that information.\nBut typically the focus\neffects wear off after\nabout two, maybe four hours maximum.\nNow one thing that I don't think\nhas ever been discussed before,\ncertainly not on this podcast\nis that if you take Alpha GPC,\neven semi-regularly,\nyou may notice that a particular feature\nof your blood work will\nincrease and that's TMAO,\nwhich is sometimes associated\nwith increased cardiovascular risk.\nThis may, again, may relate\nto some of the potential risk\nof very high levels of Alpha\nGPC ingestion over many years,\nincreasing stroke risk.\nAgain, those studies looked at people\nwho've been taking it for up to a decade,\nbut in any case,\none way to prevent the increase in TMAO,\nif you're taking Alpha GPC at all\nis to take 600 milligrams of garlic\nbecause it contains\nsomething called allicin.\nThis was a trick that was handed off to me\nby Dr. Kyle Gillette,\nwho again, was a guest on\nthis podcast some time ago,\ntalking about hormones and hormone health.\nTurns out that ingestion of\n600 milligrams of allicin\nalongside or even just\nsame day as Alpha GPC\ncan really clamp those TMAO levels\nthat would otherwise increase\nif you're taking Alpha GPC.\nAnd indeed I've done the blood work\nand that turns out to be the case.\nI saw a spike in TMAO.\nI started taking 600 milligrams of garlic\nand those TMAO levels came down.\nAnd last as it relates to acetylcholine,\nbut certainly not least,\njust as acetylcholine can increase focus,\nfocus can increase acetylcholine.\nI talked a lot about this\nin the episode on focus,\nbut there are behavioral tools\nthat you can use to enhance focus.\nThings like staring at a\nparticular visual target\nat the same distance at\nwhich you're going to perform some work\nand doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,\nnarrowing in a very deliberate\nway, your visual field,\nand then moving into a focused work about.\nThat behavioral practice of\nnarrowing your visual aperture\nwill increase the amount of\nacetylcholine transmission\nin particular neural circuits\nthat will then make it easier to focus.\nHow do we know that?\nWell, I covered in that episode,\nsome of the peer reviewed studies\nthat relate to protocols\nthat are now actively being deployed\nin schools in China and elsewhere,\nwhere kids are doing deliberate\nvisual focus exercises\nin order to increase their mental focus.\nAnd while they're not doing microdialysis\nor brain imaging on\nthose kids in real time,\nthe cognitive effects and\nindeed the performance effects\nin terms of academic ability and output\nare pretty impressive.\nSo acetylcholine increases focus.\nWe talked about some dietary\nand some supplementation-based ways\nto improve acetylcholine,\nor I should say increase acetylcholine.\nAnd that does in fact lead to increases\nin one's ability to focus.\nThis is why a lot of\nthe prescription drugs\nfor the treatment\nof Alzheimer's age-related\ncognitive decline\nand indeed, even some of the drugs\nthat tap into treatments for ADHD\nalso involve the acetylcholine system.\nSo there's nothing\nsurprising or heretical here,\nbut it is important to point out\nthat your behavioral ability to focus\nis also related to your ability to access\nand deploy acetylcholine.\nSo never do we want purely\npharmacologic treatments\nto be the only way that\npeople are increasing\na given neuromodulator.\nI always say behaviors first,\nthen nutrition,\nthen supplementation.\nAnd then if there's a need,\ncertainly a clinical need,\nthen prescription drugs,\net cetera, of course\nadministered through a physician.\nSo let's discuss serotonin.\nSerotonin, as I mentioned earlier,\nis associated with brain and\nbody states of well-being,\nof comfort, of satiety,\nand therefore should come as no surprise\nthat a lot of the\nprescription drug treatments\nfor things like depression\ninvolve increasing levels of serotonin\nin the brain and body.\nThat said, anytime you talk about\nprescription drugs for serotonin,\nwe also want to acknowledge that\nthere are often side effects associated\nwith increasing serotonin,\nin particular, if serotonin\nlevels go too high,\nthat is if the dosages of\nthose treatments go too high,\npeople will, for instance,\nfeel reduced appetite, reduced libido,\nincreased lethargy, et cetera.\nAnd there's a so-called\nserotonergic syndrome.\nAll of that can and should be considered\nwith a well-trained physician,\nso because they're prescription drugs,\ncontrolling the dosage,\ndeciding what dosage to take,\ndeciding which SSRI to take\nand whether or not to\ncome off those drugs,\nhow to come off those drugs.\nAgain, all of that should be handled\nwith a licensed physician.\nThat said, there are behavioral\ntools, nutritional tools,\nand supplementation tools\nthat can tap into the serotonin system,\nnot to the same degree in potency,\nbut nonetheless, in ways\nthat can still impact\nour feelings of well-being\nin positive ways.\nSo let's focus first\non the behavioral tools\nand some of these might make\npeople chuckle a little bit,\nbut I want to point out\nthat a lot of these tools\nare quite potent.\nIn fact, they are power tools\nfor modulating serotonin.\nAnd we know that based on\nhuman neuro imaging studies,\nhuman and animal microdialysis studies\nand other studies that\nreally have evaluated\ncirculating levels of serotonin\nand the particular brain\ncircuits that release serotonin\nwhen people do certain things.\nWhat sorts of things?\nWell, for instance, physical contact,\nin particular with loved ones,\nthis can be romantic love.\nThis can be children, so your own children\nor your spouse, even if\nit's not sexual contact,\nfriend to friend contact,\neven friend to animal contact, you know,\nas a former dog owner,\nI hope to have another dog soon\n'cause unfortunately Costello passed away,\nbut there is something really comforting\nand wonderful about petting your dog.\nAnd certainly, given that many\nof the studies on serotonin\nand these other neuromodulators\nwere done on animal models,\nwe also know that serotonin\nis being evoked in the dog\nand of course in the child\nand in the significant other, et cetera.\nSo things like holding\nhands, believe it or not,\nhugs, cuddling, et cetera,\ncan increase serotonin transmission\nand they make people feel good.\nThis shouldn't really come as a surprise.\nThere's also gratitude.\nAnd we did an entire\nepisode about gratitude.\nThere's a lot of\nmisunderstanding about gratitude.\nOftentimes when people\nhear gratitude, they think,\noh, gratitude, this is just being thankful\nfor what you have and it's\nkind of a weak sauce effect,\nmeaning, you know, it's kind of like,\nmaybe a little serotonin goes up\nor maybe there's a little bit\nof increased feelings of well-being.\nNothing could be further from the truth.\nIt turns out, first of all,\nthat receiving not giving gratitude\nis what has the most potent effects\non increasing serotonin and\nactivity of the brain circuits\nthat involve serotonin\nand that lead to increases\nin feelings of well-being.\nSo this is interesting.\nReceiving much more than giving gratitude\nis what activates those\nserotonergic pathways.\nSo the takeaway from that is\nboth give and receive gratitude\nand of course, do it in an authentic way.\nThe other thing about gratitude\nthat's somewhat counterintuitive is that\nobserving others giving\nand receiving gratitude\nis immensely powerful\nfor evoking serotonin\nand the activity of\nserotonergic circuits in you,\nthe observer.\nSo receiving and observing gratitude\nturns out to be the most potent\nway to increase serotonin\nin the brain and body.\nAnd these again are dramatic effects\nthat are quite long-lasting\nand not the sorts of effects\nthat are going to lead to side effects,\nat least there's no reason\nto think they would.\nNow what about nutritional approaches\nto increasing serotonin?\nWell, just as we have tyrosine\nas an amino acid precursor\nupstream of dopamine synthesis,\nwe have the amino acid tryptophan,\nwhich is upstream of serotonin synthesis.\nAnd one simply has to go online\nand put in tryptophan containing foods\nand you will discover that\nthere are a lot of foods\nthat are enriched in tryptophan\nthat can lead to net increases\nin the amount of serotonin\navailable in the brain and body.\nThe most kind of famous\nor infamous of these\nis white meat turkey,\nthe so-called tryptophan effect\nwhere people get very sleepy\nafter eating white meat turkey.\nAnd it is indeed highly\nenriched in tryptophan\nalthough typically the getting\nsleepy after eating turkey\nis most often associated\nwith the Thanksgiving meal\nand the Thanksgiving\nmeal, at least in the US,\nis often associated with\npeople vastly overeating.\nAnd so I do want to point out\nthat if you fill your gut with food,\nno matter what that food is,\nthere's going to be a\ndiversion of blood to your gut\nthat's going to make you feel sleepy\nbecause there's a diversion of blood\naway from other tissues.\nSo if you eat a lot, you're\ngoing to get sleepy, period,\nwhether or not you eat turkey\nor some other substance.\nNonetheless, there are a number of foods\nthat contain a lot of tryptophan\nand that some people will leverage\nin order to try and\nincrease the total amount\nof circulating serotonin available to them\nin order to have a modest increase\nin overall mood and well-being.\nSo what are some of these foods?\nThese are things like milk,\nin particular, whole milk,\nso full fat milk.\nI know a number of people\nchoose not to drink milk\n'cause they're lactose intolerant.\nI'm raising my hand 'cause\nI'm one such person,\nalthough when I was a\nkid, I did enjoy milk.\nCanned tuna.\nTurkey, as we mentioned\nbefore, high in tryptophan.\nOats, I am a consumer of oatmeal\nso that resonates with me.\nCheese and here I read,\nalthough not as high in tryptophan as meat\nand other dairy sources,\ncertain cheeses like cheddar cheeses\ncan be rich in tryptophan.\nCertain nuts and seeds, certain breads.\nChocolate, I know a number of people\nwill be relieved to hear that.\nI know chocolate lovers are always looking\nfor an excuse to eat chocolate.\nI confess I've never\nreally liked chocolate,\nexcept dare I say,\nI like the smooth 100% percent chocolates.\nI know many people gag when\nthey hear a hundred percent,\nbut I actually really like them.\nAnd some fruits can be highly\nenriched in tryptophan,\nthings like bananas and apples\nand things of that sort,\nalthough not nearly to\nthe degree of things\nlike turkey, canned tuna and milk.\nI'm sure there are other\nexcellent sources of tryptophan\nfrom the diet, including vegan sources\nso please peruse the internet to try\nand find the sources that are compatible\nwith your nutritional program,\nif indeed your goal is\nto increase tryptophan.\nNow there are supplements\nthat can increase tryptophan\nand can do so quite potently.\nOne of the ones that has\nreceived increasing attention\nas of lately is cissus quadrangularis,\ncomplicated name,\nwhen taken in dosages of\nabout 300 to 600 milligrams\ncan pretty dramatically\nincrease serotonin levels.\nIn fact, anywhere from\n30% to 39% increases\nin circulating serotonin.\nThat's a big increase\nand I can provide a link to that study.\nThe study was focused,\nnot so much on serotonin,\nbut was focused mainly\non treatment of obesity\nand appetite and weight loss.\nAnd it should come as no\nsurprise that serotonin,\nif increased, might lead\nto decreases in appetite.\nA cautionary note,\ncissus quadrangularis\nmay need to be cycled.\nHow quickly to cycle it,\nmeaning do you do two\nweeks on, two weeks off?\nWhether or not you need\nto do more rapid cycling\nlike two days on, two days\noff, is a matter of debate.\nThere are not a lot of\ndata on this just yet.\nThere are a lot of opinions\nabout this on the internet,\nbut again, not a lot of\nquality peer review data.\nNonetheless cissus\nquadrangularis has been shown\nto increase serotonin in humans\nand for people that are\nseeking to increase serotonin\nmaybe in particular,\nfor sake of appetite and weight control,\nthat might be a useful compound.\nI know many people also take 5-HTP,\none of the precursors to serotonin\nin dosages of anywhere\nfrom 300 to 500 milligrams.\nTypically people are doing\nthis in anticipation of sleep,\nmeaning in the final hour of wakefulness\nbefore going to sleep.\nI myself have tried 5-HTP prior to sleep\nand all I can tell you is\nthat it led to very deep sleep\nfor about one to three hours.\nAnd then I woke up and I\ncould not fall back asleep.\nI ran that experiment twice\nbefore I decided to abandon\n5-HTP as a sleep aid.\nAnd that's why I've never\nput it into our sleep kit\nor at least my sleep kit.\nAnd when I refer to the sleep kit,\nthat's something you can\nfind at HubermanLab.com.\nThis is zero cost resource\nwhere you can see behavioral tools\nand also supplementation tools\nthat can improve the transition time\ninto and the depth of sleep.\nAnd none of those rely\non 5-HTP supplementation.\nThat said,\nI know a number of people\nuse 5-HTP supplementation\noutside of sleep,\nor I should say during the daytime\nto try and increase serotonin\nand it will indeed increase\ncirculating serotonin.\nBut again, people vary\nin their sensitivity\nto these sorts of things.\nSome people might find for instance,\nthat 300 milligrams of\n5-HTP is just far too much.\nIt blunts their appetite,\nmight even reduce libido.\nThere aren't a lot of very\nwell controlled studies\nlooking at this\nand so it has to be figured\nout on an individual basis,\nif you decide to approach it at all.\nNow one molecule that I've found\nto be particularly interesting and useful\nand this is one that I\nhaven't talked about yet\non this podcast\nis inositol, in particular myo-inositol.\nMyo-inositol can have the\neffect of increasing serotonin\nand other neurochemicals,\nbut primarily at least in terms\nof the neuromodulators\ndiscussed today, serotonin.\nI've been taking 900\nmilligrams of myo-inositol\nevery third night or so\nas a test of its ability to improve sleep.\nAnd I have to say,\nthe depth and quality of\nsleep that I've been obtaining\non myo-inositol is pretty remarkable.\nIn fact, I've used it alone\nand in combination\nwith the magnesium threonate,\napigenin, theanine sleep kit\nthat I've talked about and\nthat's included in that,\nagain, zero cost kit that's available\nas a PDF on our website.\nSo myo-inositol is known\nto increase circulating\nlevels of serotonin.\nIt has been explored extensively\nin both animal models and in humans\nfor its daytime use for treating anxiety.\nIt does seem to reduce anxiety.\nAnd for all sorts of things.\nIt's been explored for bipolar disorder.\nWe're going to do an episode\nabout bipolar disorder coming up.\nIt's been explored for\nthe treatment of migraine.\nIt's been explored for ADHD.\nIt's been explored for a huge number\nof different conditions of brain and body.\nAgain, I've been using the 900 milligrams\nof myo-inositol in the 30\nto 60 minutes before sleep\nto improve my sleep\nand it has been doing\nthat very dramatically,\nespecially when I take it alongside\nthe rest of those sleep kit supplements.\nA quick note about myo-inositol\nfor sake of increasing serotonin.\nif you look at the human\nstudies on myo-inositol\nthat are out there\nand in particular focus\non the human studies,\nwhat you'll find is that the\ndosages that are often used\nare tremendously high,\nthings like five grams,\neight grams, 18 grams of myo-inositol\ntaken throughout the day.\nI don't know how people stomach that.\nAnd in fact, many people\ndrop out of those studies\nbecause of gastric discomfort.\nAnd yet I also wonder\nhow people tolerate it\nbecause it has somewhat\nof a sedative effect\nand this kind of anti-anxiety effect.\nAnd I can't even imagine\ngiven my experience with 900 milligrams,\nwhat one would experience taking multiple\nor many more grams per day.\nSo I certainly am not encouraging that.\nAnd the only reason I mention myo-inositol\nis that it has a known effect\nof increasing serotonin.\nAt least in my experience,\nit does not lead to this\nfalling deeply asleep\nand waking back up.\nActually to the contrary,\nif I wake up in the middle of\nthe night to use the bathroom,\nor I wake up at the middle of the night,\nfor whatever other reason,\nI find it far easier to fall back asleep\nif I've taken 900 milligrams\nmyo-inositol prior to sleep.\nSo for me, it's proving to\nbe a quite useful compound.\nI'm not aware of having any\nserotonergic deficiency overall.\nI don't consider myself depressed.\nAnd of course I should\nmention that no supplement\neither added or withdrawn\nfrom your protocol\nshould ever be used as\na direct replacement\nfor prescription drug treatments\nthat your physician has given you.\nYou should always talk to your physician\nanytime you remove or add\nsomething to your drug protocol\nor prescription protocol, of course.\nSo we've got behavioral protocols\nthat as silly as it feels to say,\nhave been shown to potently\nincrease serotonin,\nthings like physical contact, cuddling,\nholding hands with people that\nyou love, of course, right?\nI think if they were\npeople that you despise,\nit would have the opposite\neffect for obvious reasons.\nBut also receiving gratitude\nand observing gratitude,\nvery potent increases in serotonin\nand things like cissus quadrangularis,\nthings like 5-HGP may\nhave their uses, right?\nThey're very potent at\nincreasing serotonin,\nbut they do seem to have\nthe need to cycle them\nand they are nuanced.\nSome people respond well to them,\nothers like myself don't\nand of course, always be\non the lookout for dramatic\nor even subtle decreases in appetite\nor libido or things\nthat you might not want\nif you are going to be tinkering\nwith your serotonergic\nlevels and pathways.\nAnd then myo-inositol actually\nis proving to be quite useful to me\nand whether or not that's\nbecause of its effects on serotonin\nor through some of its other effects on\nmaybe reducing anxiety,\nwhich certainly I experience\nif I wake up in the middle of the night,\nI don't like waking up in\nthe middle of the night,\nbut on myo-inositol,\nI sort of seem to not\nreally care that I woke up\nand I fall right back asleep.\nSo the direct source\nof the positive effects\nthat I'm getting aren't\nclear, but nonetheless,\nI thought I'd pass it\nalong as a useful tool\nbecause it is out there\nand it is available over the counter\nand provided you're taking\nthe appropriate safety steps\nin considering whether\nor not to use it or not,\nI think it might be a useful tool.\nAnd of course,\nas with all the other\nneuromodulators we discussed,\nyou have both a baseline of serotonin\nand the ability to give\nor provide yourself peaks of serotonin\nthrough these various protocols.\nThe dietary interventions of\nthe sort that I mentioned,\nmeaning eating foods that\nare enriched in tryptophan,\nthose are mainly going to\nadjust your baseline levels of tryptophan.\nFor instance, if you\nreally want to be sleepy,\nsure you could eat some white meat turkey\nin hopes that that tryptophan\nwill convert to serotonin\nand make you sleepy, et cetera.\nBut in general,\nthose are going to be\npretty long-lasting effects,\nespecially given the fact that not all\nof the tryptophan you will ingest\nis going to be converted\ninto serotonin in your brain.\nIt's going to have other effects\non other tissues and organs of your body.\nNonetheless, if you want\nto increase serotonin,\nproviding the appropriate baseline context\nis going to be useful.\nAnd again, this is a general theme\nof all four of these neuromodulators,\ndopamine, epinephrine,\nacetylcholine and serotonin.\nYou want to make sure that you have\nsufficient baseline levels of those things\nthrough things like\ndiet, regular behaviors,\nand then you have the opportunity\nto use supplementation\nand if it's appropriate for\nyou, prescription drugs,\nand certain behavioral protocols\nto try and get these potent increases,\nthese acute increases in\nwhichever the neuromodulators\nyou happen to want to leverage\nfor your particular goals.\nSo that brings us to the end\nof at least this exploration\nof the neuromodulators,\ndopamine, epinephrine,\nacetylcholine and serotonin.\nSome of you who are regular\nlisteners of this podcast\nmight be saying, well, we've\nheard all this before, right?\nYou had an episode on dopamine.\nYou had an episode on anxiety.\nYou had an episode on sleep.\nAnd indeed that's true.\nBut what I've tried to provide today\nis a framework that cuts\nthrough all those episodes\nand at the same time builds out a new\nand what I believe to be\na really important theme and principle,\nwhich is that whether or not\nyou're using nutritional tools\nor supplementation or prescription drugs\nor any other sort of protocol\nto try and create a\ndesired effect of focus\nor energy, motivation, relaxation,\nyou are playing with the same\nneurochemical ingredients,\njust as in the realm of nutrition,\nyou have macronutrients,\nyou have proteins, carbohydrates, and fats\nthat can be adjusted in different ratios\nand arranged at different times\nin order to achieve\ncertain desired effects.\nWell, when it comes to your neurochemistry\nand your ability to perform\nmentally, to perform physically,\nand your overall well-being,\nyou are dealing with a small handful\nof especially potent molecules.\nAnd I acknowledge that there\nare many neuromodulators.\nThere are indeed many neurotransmitters,\nglutamine, glycine, GABA, et cetera.\nBut today we focused on the main four,\nmeaning the most potent\nand most widespread neuromodulators\nin the brain and body\nthat give you access to\nparticular brain states\nand body states of the sort\nthat most people desire.\nSo what I'm hoping is that\nrather than decide that any\none tool is the most useful\nor that any one neurochemical\nis most useful for that matter,\nthat the information\nthat I've provided today\nallows you a kit of versatile tools\nthat allows you to figure out\nwhat levels of dopamine and\naugmentation of dopamine\nare appropriate and necessary for you.\nWhat levels of acetylcholine\nand tools for manipulating acetylcholine\nare going to be most useful for you\nand so on and so forth\nbecause at least at this stage in time,\nthat is June, 2022,\nthere is no simple at home test.\nIn fact, there is no\nsimple laboratory test\nthat allows us to know whether or not\nour dopamine levels are high\nand our serotonin levels are low.\nWe can look at somebody\nand their behavior.\nWe can look at ourselves and\nour own mood and behavior.\nAnd we can infer what those\nlevels may or may not be.\nBut unfortunately, we don't\nhave a really good test\nof dopamine levels or serotonin levels\nthat would allow us to say,\nokay, this person, or I need\nto increase dopamine two-fold\nin order to achieve the kind\nof motivation that we want.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't exist.\nRather, we are confronted with a situation\nwhere we understand\ngenerally what these\ndifferent neuromodulators do,\nthe different mental\nstates and physical states\nthat they tend to put us into.\nAnd we reviewed those.\nAnd we know that there\nare really potent tools\nto adjust those neuromodulators,\nif not alone, but in certain combinations,\nthat is ingestion of\ncaffeine will tap into\nand support dopamine and epinephrine.\nIncreasing dopamine and epinephrine\nalongside increasing acetylcholine\nwill allow us to access\ncertain brain states,\nthat is focused, alert,\nenergized, brain states,\ngreat for learning and\nplasticity of all kinds.\nWhereas augmenting\nserotonin is going to put us\ninto a more relaxed state\nand so on and so forth.\nAnd I'd like you to keep in mind\nthat there is no negotiating\nthe fact that we all have different phases\nof our 24-hour cycle\nduring which those very\nsame neuromodulators\ntend to be naturally\nhigher or naturally lower\nand I reviewed that at the\nbeginning of the episode.\nSo my wish for you is that you\nwill take this information,\nexperiment with it as you see\nfit for you and in a safe way.\nAnd as you go forward,\nto really try and gain\nintuition and understanding\nas to not just how these protocols work,\nbut how any protocol\nthat you might encounter,\nsupplement-based, drug-based,\nbehavioral-based,\nhow those might tap into these different\nmajor neuromodulator systems.\nAnd from that, to be\nable to better predict\nand evaluate whether or not\nthey're going to be useful to you,\ndetrimental to you,\nor whether or not they should\nbe used in combinations\nthat would be more useful to you.\nIf you're learning from and\nare
