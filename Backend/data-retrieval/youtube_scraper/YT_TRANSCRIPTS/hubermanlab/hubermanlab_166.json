    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere.\nJeff Cavaliere holds a Master\nof Science in Physical Therapy\nand is a certified strength\nand conditioning specialist.\nHe did his training at the\nUniversity of Connecticut Storrs,\none of the top five programs in the world\nin physical therapy and sports medicine.\nI discovered Jeff\nCavaliere over 10 years ago\nfrom his online content.\nHis online content\nincludes information about\nhow to train for strength,\nhow to train for hypertrophy,\nwhich is muscle growth,\nhow to train for endurance,\nas well as how to rehabilitate injuries\nto avoid muscular imbalances,\nnutrition and supplementation.\nI've always found his content\nto be incredibly science\nbased, incredibly clear,\nsometimes surprising, and\nalways incredibly actionable.\nIt is therefore not surprising\nthat he has one of the\nlargest online platforms\nfor fitness, nutrition, supplementation,\nand injury rehabilitation.\nJeff has also worked\nwith an enormous number\nof professional athletes\nand has served as head physical therapist\nand assistant strength\ncoach for the New York Mets.\nAgain, the content that Jeff\nCavaliere has posted online\nhas been so immensely\nuseful to me over the years,\nthat I was absolutely thrilled\nto get the chance to sit down with him\nand ask him about\neverything from how to train\nin terms of how to split up the body parts\nthat you train across the week,\nhow to integrate strength\ntraining and endurance training,\nwhen to stretch, how to stretch.\nIndeed, we talked about nutrition,\nwe talk a bit about supplementation.\nWe talk about how to really\navoid creating imbalances\nin muscle and in neural\ncontrol over muscle.\nThis is one thing that's\nreally wonderful about Jeff is\nhe really has an\nunderstanding of not just how\nmuscles and bones, and tendons\nand ligaments work together,\nbut how the nervous system\ninterfaces with those.\nWe talked about the\nmental side of training,\nincluding when to bring\nspecific concentration\nto the muscles that you're training,\nand when to think more about\nhow to move weights through space\nand think more about\nthe movements overall.\nI'm certain that you'll find\nthe conversation that we held\nto be immensely useful and informative\nfor your fitness practices\nand also for how you mentally\napproach fitness in general,\nand how to set up a\nlifelong fitness practice,\none that will give you the\nstrength that you desire,\none that will give you\nthe aesthetic results\nthat you desire.\nOne that will set you up for endurance\nand cardiovascular health,\nbasically an overall fitness program.\nI really feel this is\nwhere Jeff Cavaliere shines\nabove and beyond so many of the other PTs\nand fitness so-called\ninfluencers that are out there.\nAgain, everything is grounded in science,\neverything is clear, and\neverything is actionable.\nAnd while we do cover an\nenormous amount of information\nduring today's episode,\nif you want to dive even\ndeeper into that information,\nyou can go to athleanx.com,\nwhere you'll find some of Jeff's programs.\nYou can also find him\nat Athlean-X on YouTube.\nThere you'll find videos for instance,\nlike the, how to repair or\nheal from lower back pain.\nSomething that I actually\nfollowed directly\nlong before I ever met Jeff,\nhas over 32 million views,\nand that is not by accident, it's because\nthe protocols there again are\nsurprising and actionable.\nThey relieved my back pain\nvery quickly without surgery.\nSo I'm immensely grateful\nfor that content.\nAnd it extends into everything from again,\nhypertrophy, endurance and\nstrength training and so on.\nAgain, it's athleanx.com as the website,\nAthlean-X on YouTube, and\nalso @athleanx on Instagram.\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis proud to announce that\nwe've partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nWe've done that for several reasons.\nFirst of all,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is exceedingly high.\nSecond of all,\nwe wanted to have a location\nwhere you could find\nall of the supplements discussed\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nin one easy to find place.\nYou can now find that place\nat livemomentous.com/huberman.\nIn addition, Momentous\nSupplements ship internationally,\nsomething that a lot of\nother supplement companies\nsimply do not do.\nSo that's terrific whether\nor not you live in the US,\nor you live abroad.\nRight now, not all of the supplements\nthat we discuss on the Huberman\nLab Podcast are listed,\nbut that catalog of\nsupplements is being expanded\nvery rapidly,\nand a good number of them\nthat we've talked about,\nsome of the more prominent\nones for sleep and focus\nand other aspects of\nmental and physical health\nare already there.\nAgain, you can find them at\nlivemomentus.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens, now called AG1.\nI started taking AG1 way back in 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason that I started taking AG1,\nand the reason I still\ntake AG1 twice a day,\nis that it covers all of my\nfoundational health needs\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it\nhas vitamins and minerals\nthat cover any deficiencies\nI might have in my diet.\nIt also has probiotics,\nand the probiotics are key\nfor supporting the\nso-called gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome are trillions\nof little microbacteria\nthat live in our gut from our throat\nall the way down to the base of our gut,\nthat support everything\nfrom our immune system\nto our hormone health, to the\nso-called gut brain access.\nThat is, our gut and our brain\nare in direct communication\nwith one another in ways\nthat support our mood,\nour ability to think,\nand overall brain health.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nand they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3+K2.\nVitamin D3 and K2 are essential\nfor an enormous number of aspects\nof your mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance\nby impacting things\nlike hormone regulation,\ncalcium regulation, and\ncardiovascular health.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart\nmattress covers with heating\nand sleep tracking and\nimportantly cooling capacity.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nor another podcast about\nthe close relationship\nbetween temperature and sleep.\nThat is, your body temperature\nhas to drop by about\none to three degrees in\norder to fall asleep,\nand waking up involves\nheating up of your body\nby about one to three degrees.\nNow, some people run\ncold during the night.\nThey need to heat their\nsleeping environment.\nOther people run too hot during the night.\nI'm one such person,\nI tend to wake up in\nthe middle of the night\nif I get warm at all.\nWith Eight Sleep, I'm able to\ncool my sleeping environment\nin a very precise way,\neven so precise that I can\ncontrol the temperature\nat the beginning, middle,\nand end of the night\nso that I fall asleep\neasily, stay deeply asleep,\nand wake up feeling better\nthan I've ever felt before.\nThe Pod Pro Cover by Eight Sleep\nis their most advanced\nsolution on the market\nfor thermal regulation.\nIt pairs dynamic, cooling and heating\nwith biometric tracking\nif you want to use that.\nAlso it has this nice feature\nthat it'll vibrate in the\nmorning to wake you up.\nI'd rather like that\nvibration feature too.\nYou can add the cover to any mattress\nand start sleeping as cool\nas 55 degrees Fahrenheit,\nor as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSo again, it can be customized\nto your sleep needs.\nIf you want to try Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com/huberman\nand check out the Pro Pod Cover\nand save $150 at checkout.\nThey currently ship\nwithin the USA, Canada,\nand the United Kingdom.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman\nto save $150 at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by two,\nall American swimmers from Stanford\nand everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nis made with performance in mind.\nThat said, the aesthetics of\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nis superb.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology\nof the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with an\nenormous number of challenges\nin order to be able to see clearly.\nROKA understands this\nand has developed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nin a manner such that when\nyou move from say a shady area\nto a brightly lit area,\nor when you are in different\nlit environments indoors,\nyou can always see with crystal clarity.\nAnd they won't slip off if you sweat.\nIn fact, they were originally\ndesigned for exercise.\nYou can wear them while\nrunning or cycling,\nbut they have a terrific aesthetics.\nSo unlike a lot of so-called\nperformance or exercise glasses\nthat are out there that\nmake people frankly\nlook like cyborgs in my opinion,\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses look terrific.\nYou'd be proud to wear them\nto work, or out to dinner,\nor when you exercise.\nIf you want to try ROKA\nglasses, you can go to roka.com.\nThat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off on your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Jeff Cavaliere.\nJeff, such a pleasure\nfor me to have you here.\n- I'm glad to be here, it's amazing.\n- I'm a longtime consumer of your content.\nI've learned a tremendous\namount about fitness,\nboth in the weight room and cardio,\nnutrition things that I've\napplied for over a decade.\nSo for me, this is\nparticularly meaningful.\nAnd my goal here is really\nto ask a bunch of questions\nto which I'm interested in the answers,\nbut also for which I know\nthe audience is really curious about.\nSo one of your mantras is,\n\"If you want to look like an\nathlete, train like an athlete\"\nand I think that's something\nreally special that sets aside\nwhat you do from what a lot of other\nvery well qualified people do.\nAnd in terms of the use\nof weights and resistance,\nwhether or not it's body\nweight or weights in the gym,\nor pulleys versus cardio,\nin terms of overall health\naesthetics and athleticism,\nis there a way that you could point to\nthe idea that maybe people should be doing\n50% resistance training and 50% cardio,\nmaybe it's 70/30, maybe it's 30/70.\nAnd here I'm talking\nabout the typical person\nwho would like to maintain, or maybe even\nadd some muscle mass,\nprobably in particular\nareas for most people,\nas opposed to just overall mass.\nAlthough we'll talk about that later,\nand people who want to maintain\na relatively low body fat percentage\nand be in good cardiovascular health.\nWhat's the sort of\ncontour of a basic program\nthat anybody could think\nabout as a starting place?\n- I think it's like a 60/40 split,\nwhich would be leaning towards\nweight training, strength\nand then the conditioning\naspect be about 40%.\nSo if you look at it over a\ncourse of a training week,\nI mean, five days in a\ngym would be a great task.\nAnd obviously not in the gym,\nit could be done at home.\nBut three days strength training,\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday.\nConditioning, Tuesday,\nThursday, you know, two days.\nIt's a pretty easy roundabout\nway to split that up,\nof course, depending upon training goals.\nAnd as you said, the\naesthetic goals like that\nwill shift dramatically.\nBut if you want to see\nthe benefits of both,\nthat's probably the effect\nof dose for strength training\nand the effect of dose for conditioning\nat the bare minimum level.\nAgain, being a much better\nperformer conditioning wise,\nyou're going to want to do more than that.\n- And in terms of the\nduration of those workouts,\nwhat's your suggestion?\nI've been weight training\nfor about 30 years,\nrunning for about 30 years,\nand mainly for health.\nAnd have found that if\nI work hard in the gym\nor at resistance training for\nmore than 60 minutes or so,\nit's very hard for me to\nrecover, I start getting cold,\nI start getting weaker\nfrom workout to workout,\nbut amazingly, at least to me,\nif I keep those workouts to\nabout 10 minutes of warmup\nand 55 minutes or so of really hard work\nfor resistance training,\nand I keep the cardiovascular work\nto about 30 or 45 minutes, I feel great.\nAnd I seem to make some progress,\nat least someplace in the\nworkout from workout to workout.\n- Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers,\n'cause those are kind of\nnumbers that we usually preach.\nWe try to keep our workouts to\nan hour or less if possible.\nNow, depending upon the\nsplit that you're following,\nif you're on a total body split,\nthere's just going to be\nmore that has to be done\nin a given amount of time.\nAnd again if you're training\nprimarily for strength,\nthat could prolong the workout,\n'cause of the longer rest\ntime is in between sets.\nBut in general, when you're\nnot focused on that one aspect,\nbut the overall health picture,\nthen you can get the job\ndone in under an hour.\nAnd again, I always say, on top of\n\"If you want to look like an\nathlete train, like an athlete,\"\nis, \"You could either train\nlonger or you could train hard,\nbut you can't do both.\"\nAnd I really believe\nthat the focus for me,\nI have a busy life,\nI have a lot of other things\nthat I do believe it or not.\nAnd it's like, I want to go\nhard and I want to go get out.\nAnd I find that my body\nalso responds to that,\nand I think a lot of guys'\nbody respond to that.\nAnd particularly as\nyou start to get older,\nI think it's the length of the workout\nthat actually causes more problems\nthan the intensity of what you're doing.\nParticularly if you're warmed\nup properly like you said.\nI've found personally that my warmup\nhas had to become more of an\nintegral part of my workout\nthan it ever has before.\nI could get in the gym when I was 20,\nand I'm going right over, I'm\ndoing the one set, two sets,\nI'm ready to go.\nYou know, and I never do\nanother workout warmup set\nfor any of the other exercise\nI do the rest of the day.\nThat's not true anymore.\nAnd I found that as long as I'm willing\nto sort of give myself a\nlittle bit of a warmup,\nthe intensity is not what bothers me.\nI'm very much in control\nof the weights that I use\nand it doesn't bother me.\nBut if I start to go pretty long,\nI start to feel achy or\nI start to have problems.\nSo again, depending upon age,\nthat also plays a factor in the length.\nBut again, I think everybody can achieve,\non a standard program,\ncan achieve the results that\nthey want within an hour.\n- In terms of splits,\nyou mentioned splits.\nAnd so for those who aren't\nfamiliar with this term splits,\nit's really which body\nparts are you training on?\nWhich days?\nSeems like almost\neverybody follows a weekly\nworkout schedule.\nAlthough the body of course\ndoesn't care about the week.\nThere's no reason thing\nthat once every seven days\nor twice every seven days\nmakes sense physiologically,\nit's just the body doesn't work that.\nBut, that's the way life is structured.\nI've seen you discuss three days a week,\nwhole body workouts.\nI've heard of splits\nlike a pushing one day,\npulling another day, legs\nanother day, a day off, repeat.\nI mean, there's so many\nvariations on this.\nWhat are some general themes\nthat we can throw out there?\nAnd in order to avoid the\nhuge matrix of possibilities,\nyou have some wonderful\ncontent that points those.\nAnd we will cap-\nIn our caption show notes,\nwe'll link out to some of those\nthat different ways to design splits.\nBut in terms of giving people a logic\nof how to think about\nsplitting up body parts,\nwhat's governing the split?\nWhat are the rules and the\nlogic that dictate a split?\n- For me, the first rule\nis will you stick to it?\nLike if you, 'cause there are split,\nI don't particularly\nlike full body splits.\nAnd I was actually talking to Jesse\nabout that the other day like,\nI don't necessarily like to\nhave to train everything.\nNow of course the volumes will\ncome down per muscle group.\nBut if you don't like to do that,\nand you actually don't look\nforward to your workout\nbecause you're dreading\nhaving to do everything\nand feeling maybe too fatigued\nby the time your workout's over,\nor the fact that those generally\ndo take a little bit longer\nand don't fit into your schedule.\nI don't care how effective the split is,\na split not done is not effective.\nSo you need to find one that fits.\nSo maybe you go into\nan alternative option,\nlike a push-pull-legs, like you mentioned.\nAnd that could be done either\none cycle through the week,\non a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,\nor it could be twice in a week.\nSo you're actually training six times,\nwhere you repeat it,\npull-push-legs, pull-push-legs,\nor however you want to do it\nwith either a day off in\nbetween the three days,\nor at the end of the six days.\nAnd again, that actually\nimpacts your schedule.\nI've broken that down before where it's,\nif you put it in between the three days,\nit's good because you're giving\nyourself an extra rest day\nin between, but it starts\nto shift that day off\nevery week as we wrap around.\nSo for those guys that we're choosing\nthat seven day schedule out\nof convenience in our heads,\nit starts to mess with that off day.\nSo others like to just\nkeep it predictably,\nlet's say on a Sunday, and\ntrain six days in a row.\nBut that's a better way\nto maybe group similar\nmuscle actions together, which I think,\nI definitely prefer that,\nbecause if I'm going to be\ntraining pulling movements,\nat least there there's\na synergy between them.\nAnd I feel like I'm looking\nto achieve one goal that day.\nAnd then, I mean, quite honestly,\nyou can go back to the bro-split days,\nand those still work effectively.\nThere's a reason why\nthey worked in the past.\nI think that science shows\nthat there's smarter ways\nto do them these days.\nLike you can come back\nand hit a related muscle,\nso you could do, let's\nsay biceps on one day\nand then come back two\ndays later and do back,\nrealizing again, synergy\nbetween the exercises there,\nyour biceps are going to\nget re-stimulated again.\nSo you could figure out\nways to make that work,\nbut the thing that I\nthink is effective there,\nis that tends to be one of the ones\nthat people like the most.\nBecause they can go in, they\nget their pump, they feel good.\nIt's pretty solely focused\non one muscle group.\n- Is that the definition of a bro-split?\nOne...\n- One muscle group a day?\n- Yeah, I see, so it's\nvery much geared towards\nstrength and aesthetics\nreally maximizing...\n- Probably more aesthetics\nthan strength, yeah.\nYou're just...\n- Hence the bro, the bro name.\n- But again, like, you know,\nin here I am a science guy\nand I could appreciate the\nbenefits of a bro-split.\nEspecially 'cause again, like to what end?\nWho's goal are we trying to achieve here?\nThose are ours.\nLike if I'm applying my\nstandards and my goals\nor even like athletic ideals,\nbut they just want to get in shape,\nthen it's perfectly fine to do\na bro split in that instance,\nif you're sticking to it again\nand you're seeing the results\nthat you want to see from it.\nBut they're able to really\nkeep their focus on one muscle,\nthey get to focus on.\nLook, a lot of times people struggle with\nthe way of an exercise feels\nuntil their second or third set.\nLike they don't have that\nproper percept of ability\nto kind of lock in on an exercise.\nSo spending a few, not only\nsets in the same exercise,\nbut then doing another exercise\nfor the same muscle group\nhelps them to dial in a little bit better\nand get more out of their training.\n- Yeah, that raised a really interesting,\nI think important question.\nEarly on when I started\nresistance training,\nwhich was when I was 16 in high school,\nI got in touch with and I was\nlearning from Mike Menzer.\n- Me too, that's crazy.\n- And Mike was very helpful.\nVery, very helpful.\nWe got to be friendly...\n- So, I just read his book,\nI didn't get a chance to be\nhim, so I'm jealous, right?\n- Well, back then no internet,\nI paid by Western Union type\nthing to send him some money\n- From the back of the magazine.\n- And then he got on the phone with me\nand my mother at the time was like,\nwhy is this grown man calling the house?\nAnd he gave me a very\nstraightforward split,\nwhich was shoulders, arms one day,\nhe had me taking two days\noff and then training legs\nand then two days off and then\nchest and back, et cetera.\n- And that's a variation\nof a bro-split too.\nWhere you're sort of\nbreaking them down that way,\nchest them back or chest\nthem bis, you know?\n- And it worked very well for me,\nI probably would've,\nbecause of my age I think,\nand because I was untrained,\nI think, largely untrained,\nI think it would've grown\non many different programs,\nbut it worked very well for me.\nI eventually just made that\nin every other day thing.\nShoulders and arms day\noff, legs day or two off,\n'cause if you hit legs\nright, at least for me,\nI'm not training the next day.\nAnd then I'm not doing\nmuch of anything athletic\nthe next day, and chest,\nback and repeat and so on.\nAnd the reason I found that helpful\nis I almost always\nrecovered between workouts.\nThe six day a week\nprogram of push-pull-legs,\npush-pull-legs, to me seems excruciating\nfrom two standpoints.\nOne is, at least with\nmy recovery abilities,\nor lack of recovery abilities,\nI can't imagine coming back feeling fresh.\nAnd the other one is,\nif I'm in the gym more\nthan four days a week,\nI really start to fatigue it\nabout the whole psychological\nexperience of it.\nWhereas if I'm in there\nthree or four days a week.\nIn other words, if I put a day\noff in between each workout,\nI really want to be there.\nAnd I get in there with a lot of fire.\nAnd I'm also doing other\nthings on the off days.\nSo I think that, I love that you mentioned\nthe split that you'll stick to.\nAnd that you can bring the intensity to,\nbecause I think that\nthat's really important.\nI sometimes hear about two a day training.\nI've done two a day training\ntwice in my lifetime,\nboth times I got sick two days later.\nThat's correlation, not causation.\nBut is there ever an\ninstance where two a day\nweight training makes sense\nfor the non-drug assisted,\ntypical recovery ability person?\n- Actually, I think it makes\nsense in some scenarios,\nbut it doesn't make sense practically\nfor a lot of people's schedules.\nSo like if you could break down,\nlet's say you were going to do even\nsome version of a total body session,\nor maybe like you're going to\ndo an upper lower split, right?\nYou could do an upper workout\nand do the anterior chain\nor the pushing portion\nof that in one session\nand then come back and do\nthe pulling session later on\nat night, if you had the opportunity to.\nThe thing that you benefit from there\nis the freshness of focus.\nAgain, like something\nin my head is sacrificed\nby the time you get\ntowards the latter half\nof whatever workout you're in.\nTo the same point you made before like,\nwhen you start to approach\nthat 50 minutes an hour mark,\nyou are either losing\nfocus, you're losing energy,\nyou're losing contract viability,\nyou're losing something.\nAnd if you're relegating whatever it is,\nthe pulling portion of that\nto the end of that workout,\nsomething suffers so that,\nand if they realize that's happening,\nthen maybe you switch them up\nthe next time you do the workout\nwhere the pulling portion of\nthe upper workout goes first,\nand then the pushing goes later,\nso you're at least not\njust continuing that cycle,\nbut at the same time,\nif you were able to kind of split them up,\nyou get a chance to kind of take a break,\nyou could have that\nfreshness of focus again,\nand you could actually\nget a better effort in,\n'cause again, I think\neffort drives the results.\nSo if the effort is not compromised,\nthen you should be able to do that.\nBut systemically is that a problem?\nAnd I think that it is a\nproblem for a lot of people.\nIt's just hard to,\nit's hard to rev the engine\nup a lot of times in the day.\nYou warm that thing up once,\nit's like that car in the\nwinter, you get it going once,\nyou're lucky, okay,\nnow you got to drive\nit the rest of the day.\nBut you put it in the garage\nand try to start it the\nnext day, it's a problem.\nSo, you know, young people\ncan get away with it\na lot more than older people could.\n- Well, I've never had a\nstrong recovery quotient,\nbut if I stick to this\none day off in between,\nevery once in a while, two\ndays in a row training,\nmaybe because I have to travel\nand I want to make sure\nI get all the workouts\nand kind of thing, I seem to be okay.\nI like your example of warming up the car,\nspoken like a true east coaster,\nor those of us are on the west coast,\nI took a moment there,\nbut we folks from the East\nCoast and the Midwest, get it,\nand certainly from Europe.\nIn terms of the mixing up\nof cardiovascular training\nand resistance training,\nsame day, different day,\nwhich one should come first,\nwhich one should come second?\nIf one main goals, again,\neveryone listening has\ndifferent goals are,\nmost people would like to either maintain\nor gain some muscle.\nI don't know many people\nthat want to lose muscle.\nTo maintain or gains some muscle,\nusually in specific\nlocations on their body,\nmost people would like to be\na bit leaner or a lot leaner.\nThere are a few people out there that are\neither naturally lean or don't want,\nor actually just want to gain weight.\nBut assuming that people\nwant to get leaner,\nput on some muscle, maintain muscle,\nand want to have a healthy\nheart and a healthy brain,\nwhich basically requires a\nhealthy cardiovascular system,\nhow would you incorporate\ncardiovascular work\ninto the overall weekly regimen?\n- So again, I think that the bare minimum\nis probably twice a week\nin terms of cardiovascular.\nIf you want to have some semblance\nof cardiovascular conditioning.\nBut I think most people\nwho actually need it more\nor want to pursue it more than that\nare going to need more time to do that.\nSo at some point it can't just\nbe relegated to a day off,\nor a day off from the\nweight training workouts.\nSo at some point it has\nto occur on the same day.\nAnd in that case, I just like to put it,\nif that is, you're not your primary goal,\nbut you're looking more for\nthe, just the overall picture,\nthe aesthetics you mentioned,\nputting muscle on in certain areas,\nthen I would put it at\nthe end of the workout.\n'Cause you don't want\nit in any way compromise\nthe weight training work out.\nAnd as we've sort of referenced\na couple times already,\nthe intensity of those\nworkouts is important.\nAnd we know there's a strength component\nto those workouts also that is going to\nbe a helpful stimulus for growth.\nSo the conditioning, the cardio,\nthat stuff done prior to any training,\nstrength training, workout,\nis likely going to impair your ability\nto perform at your best.\nSo unless it's just done\nfor a quick little warmup\nin the beginning,\nbut then it's not sustained\nlong enough really to be\na benefit for cardiovascular conditioning.\nSo I just like to put that at the end,\nrealizing that even if\nmy effort level is lower,\nmy output is lower,\nif it's still placing a\ndemand on my cardiac output\nto get that conditioning\neffect because I'm fatigued,\nit still has a demand\non my cardiac output,\nso it's still achieving its goal,\nbut it didn't interfere with my main goal\nof being able to increase\nmy performance in the gym.\n- Got it.\nAnd in terms of the form\nof cardiovascular training,\nI've seen you do a number of,\nI have to say very impressive\nhigh intensity interval type work.\nSo burpee type work,\nor pushups with crunches mixed into them,\nanyway, people can see your videos,\nI didn't describe those in the best way,\nbut rather than on the treadmill\nor out jogging for 30-45 minutes,\nis that because you\nprefer higher intensity,\nhigher heart rate type training,\nor is it because you\nlive in cold Connecticut,\nand you don't want to be\nout jogging on the roads\nin the middle of the winter?\n- I think all the above,\nI mean, those are factors\nfrom a personal level,\nbut I think that if you are-\nIf we could blend function\nacross these realms\nand not have such a delineation between,\nthis is my way training,\nand this is my conditioning,\nbut figure out a way\nto blend them together,\nI always think that you've got\na better opportunity to get\nthat more well rounded result.\nAnd I like to kind of mix up\nthat straight conditioning work\nand also some of the footwork drills.\nWe have some high expectations for guys\nthat come into our programs,\nlike to just do some footwork drills.\n- Like ladders.\n- Like ladders,\nor line drills or something.\nAnd you know what happens?\nPeople become intrigued and interested.\nLike I never, I haven't\ntried this since high school.\nAnd they become interested\nin just the challenge of it,\nand then as we become almost\ndistracted by the challenge,\nwe're now like finding\nourselves conditioning.\nAnd I always think\nthat's an important part,\nthat sometimes you got to draw people in\nto show them what they\nmight be interested in.\nAnd from the output or the effect of it,\nI just think that when\nyou're able to blend some,\nstill maintain some of\nthat strength training\ninto the exercise, as you mentioned,\nlet's say I'm doing some kind\nof a push up or a burpee,\nthere is an anaerobic component to that\nthat is going to be helpful,\nthat then rather than just\nwalking or just jogging.\nNot to say that that\nisn't an effective means\nfor strict cardiac conditioning,\nit's one of the ways that\nwe've had for centuries,\nhow to do it.\nBut I just think that if we can blend it,\nthen it becomes maybe a\nlittle bit more interesting\nand you get some of\nthose crossover benefits,\nand it doesn't become so segmented\nin terms of what we're trying to do.\n- I love the idea of bringing\nsome mental challenge\nand some desire to improve\na skill while conditioning.\nThat's not something that\nI've thought of before,\nand it's simply 'cause I've overlooked it,\nbut it makes sense because, my\nsister who's reasonably fit,\nalthough I'm always trying\nto get her to do a bit more,\nshe always asks me, what should I take?\nAnd I'm a, I don't\nbelieve her in supplements\nare for certain people\nin certain instances,\nbut I keep telling her, you know, it's,\nthe behaviors are going to end,\nnutrition are going to\nhave the greatest outsize\npositive effect.\nAnd she loves things like\ndance classes and things,\nor kickboxing, these\nkinds of things which,\nso it makes sense that\nif you can hook somebody\non the conditioning\naspect or the skill aspect\nand kind of trick them\ninto doing more cardio,\nso to speak that's terrific.\nAlso the neuroscientist\nin me just has to say,\nforgive me, that anytime you're engaging\nthe two sets of motor neurons,\nthe ones in your brain,\nthe upper motor neurons and\nthe ones in your spinal cord,\nanytime you're engaging\nthose upper motor neurons,\nwhich are for deliberate\nwell controlled action,\nyou're doing a great thing for your brain\nin terms of brain longevity.\nSo, now I need to incorporate\nsome actual skills\ninto my training.\nGoing back to weight training a bit,\none of the most important\nthings I learned from you,\nso over the years was that,\nwhen training to increase\nmuscle size, to really think,\nnot so much about moving weights,\nbut more about challenging muscles.\n- Yeah.\n- I also heard this from\nmy friend, Ben Pakulski,\nwho's a very well accomplished,\nHe was a bodybuilder,\nnow he's into other aspects\nof fitness, teaches fitness,\nbut don't move weights challenge muscles,\nunless you're trying to power lift\nor something of that sort, which\nI'm not, immensely helpful.\nBut the other thing that\nI learned from you that,\ncombined with that was this idea that\ncertain muscles will grow\nbetter and get stronger\nmuch more easily, maybe\neven will recover better\nbecause of our ability to\ncontract them really hard.\nAnd this what I call the Cavaliere test,\nwhich is at least if I could paraphrase,\nso for instance, if I can, it's\nalways the bicep, isn't it?\nLet's use the calf or the bicep.\nIf you can flex your\nbicep to the point where\nit hurts a little bit,\nlike it almost feels\nlike a cramp or a cramp,\nwhere you can flex your\ncalf to the point where\nit really cramps up a little bit,\nalmost feels like it's nodding up,\nthat's a pretty good indication\nthat you're going to be able to\nstimulate that muscle well under load\nif you're doing the movement properly.\nAnd that's the feeling to\nactually aim for each repetition,\nmaybe even throughout the repetition.\nFor me, this completely\ntransformed my results.\nAnd this was, I think\nmaybe five/six years ago\nthat I first heard this from you,\nbody parts that for me, lagged behind,\nthat I thought maybe genetically\nweren't going to work for me,\nimmediately just started growing, right?\nAnd I was getting stronger and stronger,\nand I thought this is\nreally something so much so\nthat I've dedicated a\nportion of my research\nalong with, in collaboration\nwith another group\nto try and understand\nwhat's happening in these upper\nmotor neurons in the brain\nthat can engage the muscles even more.\nAnd that it's not just\nabout progressive overload\nor putting a pump into the muscle.\nThat it's really this\nmind muscle connection\nis a real thing when it\ncomes to predicting results\nand that you can get better at it.\nSo forgive me if we're paraphrasing\nyour incredible content around this,\nit made a tremendous difference for me\nand a number of other people\nthat have passed that along to.\nBut what can you, first of all,\nhow did you arrive at that?\nBecause we hear about the\nmind-muscle connection,\nbut I really heard it first from you.\nHow did you arrive at\nthis kind of cramp test,\nthe Cavaliere test as I'll call it?\nIt's always weird when people name things\nafter themselves in science,\nbut other scientists can name things.\nSo there is now officially\nthe Cavaliere test,\nis whether or not you can cramp the muscle\nin the absence of load, just flexing it\nto the point where it hurts a little bit.\nThat would be a good indication\nthat you could grow that muscle well.\nHow did you come up with this?\n- I mean, honestly, it's\nsomething that made sense to me,\nbecause during my workouts,\neven as a young kid\njust starting out, I always wanted to know\nwhat is it working?\nA lot of people ask that\nquestion more so than you think,\nlike, what is this supposed to work?\nAnd a lot, I don't know\nif you've ever noticed,\nbut like when people ask that question,\nif they're being trained by a trainer,\nand the trainer's saying,\nwell, just do this,\ndo this exercise and they'll\nshow you how to do it.\nBut then they'll say, but\nwhat is it supposed to work?\nWhere am I supposed to feel this, right?\nPeople, did they just\ninherently ask that question?\nA lot of people will.\nI was one of those that did\nthat, and I asked that question.\nNot because I knew what I was doing,\nbut just because I don't know,\nI wanted to know what was\nsupposed to be doing the work.\nOnce you do that, and you\nstart to seek that out,\nand say, okay, well,\nthe bicep is what's supposed\nto be doing the work,\nthen I want to make sure\nthe bicep's doing the work.\nSo then I would just sort of\nreally like tweak the movement\nto make it do more work or\nfeel more uncomfortable,\nor get it stronger contraction,\nknowing if that's supposed to do the job,\nit wasn't until PT\nschool that I'm learning,\noh, well, the flexion of the elbow\nis the brachial and the bias\nand the bias' responsible for supination.\nYou started to, I learned\nother components of it,\nbut all I wanted to know was\nto bring my arm up in a curl,\nwhat is supposed to do the job?\nSo I would seek out ways\nto make that happen better.\nAnd when I was able to do that,\nI could feel the stronger contraction.\nAnd I just, I don't know what it, I just,\nI was no visionary, I just felt like\nI knew that that was\ngoing to be better for me\nif the muscle I was trying to grow\nwas being stressed more effectively.\nSo when I was attempting to do this\nacross different exercises,\nI would notice that\nwhat I could do potentially\non a curl where my arm is up,\nwhere you asking me to flex\nmy bicep that position,\nI couldn't do if I was\ndoing a concentration curl,\nor I couldn't carry over to a cable curl,\nand that shouldn't really change,\n'cause the function is\nstill largely the same,\nthere's still elbow flexion,\nthere's still supination,\nwhy am I not able to do it there?\nAnd that's when it sort of\nclued into me that like,\nyour mind-muscle connection on\nnot just your mind with one muscle,\nbut on every exercise matters,\nand it varies from exercise to exercise.\nAnd even if you don't gain\nmuscle size from doing that,\nalthough I think it's very hard not to,\nespecially if you're\nnot used to doing that,\nthere's a term I like to call muscularity,\nwhich is a difference, right?\nIt's the level of sort of\nresting tone in the muscle.\nThat improves dramatically.\nIf you can learn how to just start to\nengage that muscle better,\nthe muscularity, the\nresting tone of that muscle\nis harder, it's more at\nattention, it's more alive.\nAnd it's all driven from\nbeing able to connect better\nneurologically with the muscle\nthat you're trying to train.\nI've talked about a lot in efficiency\nis really what you're\ntrying to seek in movements\nwhen you're trying to create hypertrophy.\nWhen strength is your goal,\nefficiency of the movement\nis what you're looking for.\nYou're looking to have\nmuscles tied together\nand work well efficiently,\nthe chest, the shoulders, the triceps,\nto get a bar off of your\nchest or in a bench press.\nYou're not looking to\nmake it a very inefficient\nleverages for your chest,\nto try to grow your\nchest in a bench press,\nyou're trying to let the\nwhole package come together\nfor a greater output.\nBut when you're trying to go\nand create muscle hypertrophy\nor even this muscularity\nthat I talk about,\nyou need to seek ways to make\nit feel more uncomfortable.\nIf you don't feel the discomfort,\nthen you're doing something wrong.\nAnd I struggle to this day\non certain muscle groups\nto still do that, even knowing\nwhat I'm trying to work\nand knowing what the goal of\neverything I'm preaching here.\nIt's very difficult for some muscles\nand for certain people to\ndo this on certain muscles.\nBut as you mentioned, practice does help.\nAnd the more you become consistent\nand deliberate with what\nyou're trying to do,\nthe more of a result you actually get.\n- It's couple of really\ncouple of points I'd like\nto delve into further.\nFirst of all, my hunch was always that\nthe muscle groups that grew most easily\nand that I could contract\nhardest without any-\nThe first time I did the\nCavaliere test, got 10 out 10.\nIf we give it a 10 out of 10 scale.\nIt could just like cinch,\nisolate those muscles,\ncinch them, grow them easily.\nI mean, there's certain body parts,\nI don't want to say which ones,\n'cause it doesn't really\nmatter, that I always felt like\nif I just did pushups, they would grow,\nand these muscles are far\naway from any of the muscles\nthat are supposed to\nbe involved in pushups,\neven though I like to think\nI'm doing pushups correctly.\nYou'll tell me if I'm not.\nBut some of that I think is genetic,\nand some of that has to do\nwith the sports that I played\nwhen I was younger.\nSo I swam, I played soccer, I skateboard.\nAnd then later I boxed.\nAnd so the muscles\ninvolved in those sports\nwere always very easy to engage\nlater when I went into the gym.\nSo I guess perhaps a call to parents,\nhaving kids do a lot of dynamic activity,\nseems like it might be a good idea.\nThe other thing is this\nissue of muscularity.\nI am so glad you brought that up.\nThere are, I have to imagine\na large number of listeners\nwho don't want to get bigger.\nThey don't want to take\nup a larger clothing size.\nThey don't want to take up more space.\nIn fact, some of them would\nlike to take up less space,\nbut they want that quality\nthat you're describing,\nwhich is that, oftentimes\nyou hear it more in the,\nhere I'm stereotyping a\nbit, but with kindness.\nYou hear from women who\nhaven't weight trained,\nthey say, I don't want to get big, often.\nSometimes they do,\nbut most women that\nI've helped weight train\nor talked to about weight train say,\nI don't want to get big,\nI want to get toned.\nAnd I think what they're referring to\nis this quality of muscularity.\n- A hundred percent,\n- This idea that at resting\nor at close to rest, or\nanytime someone reaches out\nand grabs a glass,\nthat the muscles almost look\nlike they're kind of twitching\nunderneath the skin.\nAnd yet it's Saran wrap skin\nanatomy chart type skin.\nSo this thing of\nmuscularity, or resting tone,\nhas a physiological basis,\nI think it's how readily the nerves\nare communicating with the muscles.\nAnd you're saying that by\nlearning to engage the muscles\nmore actively, the resting tone\nor muscularity can improve.\nHave you seen that both in men and women?\n- Yeah, oh yeah.\n- And do you think this is\nsomething that takes upkeep,\nmaintenance, or that once\nyou develop that in a muscle,\nyou can just kind of let it coast.\n- I think like everything\nat key, it requires upkeep,\nyou know, user lose it,\nI do believe firmly,\nbut like I think that the\ndevelopment of the connections\nis going to be harder than the\nmaintenance of the connection.\nAs I said, I still struggle\nto this day for myself with\nunnamed muscle groups, they also,-\nBut there's just certain areas\nthat are harder for your\nbrain for whatever reason\nto just develop that connection\nat that type of level\nto create that extra strong contraction.\nBut I think that with\nproper dedication and focus,\nand then I'll go right out and say,\ncalves is one of the areas that\nI don't necessarily have\na great connection with,\nand I also obviously must not care so much\n'cause I don't put in the time and effort\nto create that connection as I could.\nSo I think what might happen is,\nyou know yeah, there\ncould be a struggle there,\nbut then with struggle comes disinterest,\n'cause you're like, well\nscrew it, I'm a calf knot\nand I'm not going to do anything about it.\nSo I think if you put\nthe required effort in,\nand the time and repetitions\nthat you will develop that,\nand once you do develop it,\nit's going to stick around\na lot longer than it would\nhad you not invested\nany time into it at all,\nnot requiring as much of that.\nBut I mean, I don't\nknow, like you mentioned,\nnow when you train, it's like,\nyou're just, this is just\npart of how you train now,\nlike you're going hard,\nyou're trying to really\nforcefully contract.\nYou're not just moving the weight,\nI say from point A to point B,\nbut you're like trying\nto contract the weight\nthrough that range.\nThat is a mindset that I try to put into\nwhat everything I'm doing,\nunless of course I'm focused\non a strength exercise\nwhere I'm just trying\nto lift a greater amount\nand use all the muscles together.\nBut when the goal is\ninefficiency for hypertrophy,\nI am really trying to\ncreate that contraction,\nand it's just part of my training.\nSo I guess that for consistency's sake,\nas long as I'm training is happening.\nIf I get away from training\nthat it's not happening at all,\nbut you know, even there,\nI probably another embarrassing\nadmission probably,\nwill mindfully do it throughout the day,\neven with no weight in my\nhand, in certain muscle groups,\nwhether it be my abs or my arm\nor my shoulders or something,\nI'm doing something just to\nsort of engage the muscles.\nAnd I do think that some of\nthat sort of inane practice\nactually helps by the time\nyou go back into the gym.\nYou just kind of keep\nthat connection going.\n- Well, it certainly obeys all\nthe rules of neuroplasticity.\nYou know the fire together\nwired together mantra,\nwhich is the words of my\ncolleague, Carla Shatz,\nhold true for all aspects\nof neural function,\nincluding nerve to muscle.\nSo these flexing throughout the day\nor the deliberate isolation\nof contracting a muscle\nthroughout the day is without question\nengaging neuroplasticity.\nAnd if you were to do\nfewer those repetitions,\nyou're going to get less engagement\nof the nerve to muscle connection.\nI can say this with a smile\nand with confidence because,\none of the first things all\nneuroscience students learn\nis about the neuromuscular junction,\n'cause it's a really\nsimple example of where\nthe more times the nerve fires\nand gets the muscle to contract,\nthe stronger that connection get,\nreceptors are brought\nthere, et cetera, et cetera,\nthere's a whole bunch of\nmechanisms for a topic\nof another podcast.\nBut basically that\npractice throughout the day\nmakes total sense and works.\n- Yeah, and there's no, believe me,\nthere's no science behind that\nin terms of the application of it.\nYou do it when,\nyou catch yourself doing\nit from time to time.\nBut it is definitely\nsomething that's easily done\ndiscreetly and you wind up doing.\nI actually, I think in a recent\nvideo when I did talk about\ngrowing your arms by just\nimproving the connection.\nNot that that connection\nitself is applying any load\nor resistance that's significant\nto create overload for growth,\nbut it's the development\nof that connection\nthat I then take back with me into the gym\nat a more effective level\nthat takes every exercise I do there\nand makes it more effective.\n- That's like sharpening\nthe blade, so to speak.\nYeah, certainly obeys the laws\nof nerve to muscle physiology.\nWanted to just touch\non a couple of things.\nIf the goal is to challenge muscles,\nand one is dividing their\nbody into, let's say,\na three or four day a week\nsplit or so, or maybe up to six,\nhow do you know when a muscle is ready\nto be challenged again?\nAgain, I've heard, okay, every 48 hours is\nprotein synthesis increases\nand then we'll get into this\nand then it drops off.\nBut frankly, if I train my legs hard,\nI can get stronger from\nworkout to workout,\nor at least better in some\nway, workout to workout,\nleg workout to leg workout,\ntraining them once every\nfive to eight days.\nIf I train them more often, I get worse.\nSo whatever that 48 hour\nto 72 hour thing is,\nsomehow my legs don't obey that,\nor maybe something else is wrong with me,\nbut I'm sure there are many\nthings else wrong with me,\nbut how do you assess\nrecovery at the local level,\nmeaning at the level of the muscles,\nso we'll talk about soreness,\nand getting better, stronger,\nmore repetitions, et cetera?\nAnd then at the systemic level,\nthe level of the nervous system.\nAnd I'd love for you to\ntell us about the tool that,\nagain, I learned from you,\nwhich is actually using a physical scale,\nbecause it turns out that,\nwill let you tell what the tool is,\nbut that tool is also actively being used\nfor assessing cognitive decline,\nand cognitive maintenance,\nand cognitive function\nin people with Alzheimer's and dementia.\n- That makes total sense.\nMakes total sense.\nSo regarding the first\npart of the question,\nhow would you kind of dictate\nwhen a muscle's recovered?\nSo I do think that what you're\nexperiencing is totally real,\nthat different muscles\nrecover at different rates.\nAnd I've always been so\nfascinated by this concept.\nI've talked about internally\nwith my team, but like,\nI feel like what we really need\nthe holy grail to training,\nis going to be when we're\nable to crack the code\non an individual basis,\nwhen a muscle is recovered,\nand that is going to dictate\nits training schedule.\nAnd the fact that you might have a bicep\nthat could be trained\nvia a pulling workout,\na regular bicep dedicated workout,\nforget to split at the moment.\nYou may have a bicep\nthat's able to be trained,\nthat can be trained again the next day.\nAnd then the next day,\nand then maybe you need\na day off after that.\nBut like, that can vary from\nperson to person for sure,\nand it can vary from muscle\nto muscle in that person\nover the course of time as you mentioned,\n'cause the systemic\nrecovery is going to impact\nall those muscles anyway,\nbut let's say you're\nsystemically recovering,\nevery muscle itself is going\nto have a recovery rate.\nAnd I think what's fascinating is that,\nwhen you talked about before\nwe like to train in this week,\nor we have, like the way\nour mind looks at training,\nwell, if that was the\ncase with the biceps,\nthat bicep is a slave to the\nrest of your training split.\nWhere it's like, well, why\ndoes it have to be also\nat the end of every\neighth day or whatever,\nwhen it might respond better to something\nmuch more frequently?\nAnd your legs are also\nbeing thrown into that mix.\nThere's a Mike Menzer\nconcept where he's like,\ntrain one set and be done for 14 days.\nI mean, there's such variability\nbetween muscle groups\nand you're linking them all together.\nI think that coming back\nand using muscle soreness\nas a guideline for that, is\none of the only tools we have\nin terms of the local level.\nYou know we don't really\nhave, being able to measure,\nlet's say CPK levels inside\nof a muscle would be amazing,\nat a local level to see how\nrecovered that muscle is,\nbut that becomes fairly invasive,\nat least to my knowledge,\nit becomes fairly invasive.\nSo what are our tools?\nI mean, I think that at the basic level,\nthat's the one that most\npeople can relate to\nand easily identify, and\nthen use that as a guideline.\nAnd if you're training\nwhen you're really sore,\nit's probably not a great idea.\nAnd it's probably a good indication\nthat that muscle's not recovered,\nbut at least hearing what\nyou and I are saying here\nmight be a comfort to the person to say,\nyeah, it is possible\nthat it's not recovered.\nJust because 48 hours\nis the recommendation.\nAnd just because research points\nto muscle protein synthesis\nneeding a restimulation, well, maybe not,\nmaybe you're not necessarily there yet.\nFor that muscle that you're not there yet.\nSo it's all really interesting stuff,\nbut as far as the systemic recovery,\nI think there's a lot of\nways people talk about\nresting heart rate\nmeasured in the morning,\nall different kinds of core temperature\nand things like that\nthat might become altered\nin a state of non recovery.\nBut grip strength is very\nmuch tied to performance\nand recovery.\nAnd when I was at the Mets,\nwe used to actually take\ngrip strength measurements\nas a baseline in spring\ntraining all the time.\nNow, obviously as a baseball player,\nyou're gripping a bat, you're pitcher,\nyou're gripping a ball like-\nHaving good grip strength is important,\nso if you've noticed somebody\nhad a very weak grip,\nit's just a good focal point\nof a specialized training\ncomponent for the...\n- Would you use this\nevery day with those guys?\n- No, we would do, in spring training,\nwe do sort of a baseline\nentry level measurement.\nAnd then we would measure\nit throughout the season,\nmaybe once every two weeks or three weeks.\nAnd the idea there was\nto manage the recover,\nmeasure the recovery.\nBut I just gave it away, to\ndetermine overall recovery,\nyour grip strength is\npretty highly correlated.\nSo we have found that\nwith one of those scales,\nthose old fashioned bathroom scales\nat like the bathroom and\nbeyond, or whatever you can get,\nwhich by the way, almost impossible,\nI believe Jesse and I were\nsearching for the last scale\nto put in that video.\nAnd we almost couldn't find one,\n'cause everything is like\ndigital and everything.\nI'm looking at the old\nfashioned dial controls.\n- It's like old Macintosh computers.\nThere's a huge market\nfor them and old phones.\nKids keep your phones now.\nIn 30 years, the lame phone now\nwill be worth a lot of money.\n- It'll be worth a lot.\nSo, I wound up finding\none, and it's a great tool\nfor just squeezing the\nscale with your hands\nand seeing what type of\noutput you could get.\nAnd I think we all can relate to this\nwhen you just visualize,\nimagine the last time you\nwere sick, or that when you,\nor just try this, the next time\nyou wake up in the morning,\nwhen you first wake up in the\nmorning, you're still groggy.\nTry to squeeze your hand,\ntry to make a fist as hard as you can.\nYou're going to sit\nthere angry at your fist\nbecause it won't contract\nas hard as you know it can.\nYou don't have the ability\nto just create the output.\nAnd that is because in that\nstate, you're still sleepy,\nyou're still fatigued,\nyou're not even awake\nthe whole level at this point.\nWell, that is still an actual\nphenomenon that happens that,\na lack of recovery, or\nlack of wakefulness,\nor whatever you want to say\nis going to lead to a\ndecreased output there.\nSo when you start to measure\nthat on a daily basis,\nyou can get a pretty good\nsense of where you're at.\nAnd I think when people\nstart to see a drop off\nof 10% or so, or even\ngreater of their grip output,\nyou really should skip the gym that day.\nBecause I don't think there's\nmuch you're going to do there\nthat's going to be that beneficial,\neven if it is the day to train\nlegs or whatever day it is.\n- I love this tool, it's\nsimple, it's low cost,\nif you can find such a scale.\nI guess you could also find\none of those grippers that,\nand you could do this in a\nvery non quantitative way,\nbut better would be a scale\nwhere you could actually measure\nhow hard you can squeeze this\nthing at a given time of day.\nIt draws to mind, just a\nlittle neuroscience factor,\nin the world of circadian neurobiology,\none of the consistent findings is that\nin the middle of your nighttime,\nthey'll wake people up and\nthey'll say, do this test.\nIn the laboratory they\nuse a different apparatus,\nbut it's essentially the same thing.\nAnd in the middle of the night\ngrip strength is very, very low.\nAnd mid-morning, grip strength is high,\nand as the body temperature\ngoes up into the afternoon,\ngrip strength goes higher\nand higher and higher,\nand then it drops off.\nThere's this circadian\nrhythm and grip temperature.\nSo you probably want to do this\nat more or less the same time each day\nif you're going to use it.\nBut it I think it's\nbrilliant in its simplicity\nand it's directness to\nthese upper motor neurons,\n'cause that's really what\nit's assessing your ability.\nAgain, it's about the ability\nto contract the muscles hard.\nIf you can't do that,\nyou're not going to get\nan effective workout.\n- Yeah, and they also, I mean,\nthere certainly are more\nsophisticated tools too.\nAs PT, we have hand grip dynamometers,\nwe can measure one side at a time too.\nI'm not really, I'm getting\na little bit blinded\nby the fact that both hands\nare squeezing into that scale\nand I don't get really\na left right comparison.\nBut even at that level,\nthat could give you a\nlittle bit more detail,\nbut that comes with a cost,\nthose are pretty expensive devices.\nBut if it's, listen,\nif you were an athlete,\nthe $200, $300 it cost\nto have one of those\nwould be well worth the added investment.\n- And I'm sure some of our\nlisteners will want one too,\n'cause there are a lot\nof tech geeks out there,\nnot tech industry geeks, but\npeople who like tech gear.\nWhat's it called again?\n- It's a hand grip dynamometer.\n- Hand grip dynamometer.\n- Dynamometer.\nSaid by Jeff with a\ngreat East Coast accent,\nand by me in a terrible\nbotched at West Coast version.\nThank you, well, I'll put\nthat in the show notes also.\nNow I think recovery is key,\nwe always hear about sleep.\nYou grow when you sleep and\nincidentally your brain,\nyou stimulate learning when\nyou're awake obviously,\nbut the reordering of neural\nconnections happens in sleep.\nThis is why sleep is\nthe way to get smarter,\nprovided you're also\ndoing the learning part.\nThe sleep's the way to get stronger\nprovided you're also\ndoing the training part.\nYou've had some really,\nyou've put out interesting\ncontent over the years\nin terms of even sleep position.\nOne of the major changes that\nI made to my sleep behavior\nis to not have the sheets\ntucked in at the end of the bed.\nAnd I'll tell you,\nthis had a profound\nimpact on several things.\nFirst of all,\nmy feet have always been\nthe bane of my existence,\nbroke them a bunch skateboarding.\nAnd I noticed when I'd\nrun, I'd get shin splints.\nAnd then I started to\nnotice that my feet sort of,\nyou're the PT, they were kind of floppy,\nas if I was pointing my toes\nslightly all the time at rest.\nAnd I realized that based on\nlistening to you previously,\nthat my sheets were wrapped\ntight, not hotel tight.\n- Right.\n- What their thing in the hotels.\nAnd I started releasing the\nsheets at the end of the bed,\nand I also started doing\nsome tibialis work.\nFront of Shin's work\nessentially, changed everything.\nMy back pain from running\nmy shin splints disappeared,\nmy posture improved,\nalthough my audience will tell me\nthat it still needs improvement.\nThey're always five or 10 people that-\nI've actually had chairs\nsent to our mailing address.\nVery nice chairs, right?\nSo I'm trying there.\nBut this is fascinating, right?\nThe position that one sleeps in,\nI fortunately have never\nhad any shoulder issues\nknock on wood, but maybe you could just\ntalk to us a little bit about\nsleep and sleep position\nfor sake of waking position and movement.\n'Cause this, I think is a very unique\nand very powerful way\nto think about sleep.\nThis podcast has done\na lot of episodes about\nkeeping the room cool,\ngetting sunlight in your eyes, et cetera,\nhow to get into sleep.\nBut you've talked about physically,\nwhat positions might\nbe better to sleep in.\nSo please, please enrich us.\n- I mean, first of all,\nsome people's opinions of\nthat type of content is that,\nyou sleep in the position\nthat's most comfortable\nso you ensure that you're sleeping.\nOh great, I understand\nthat we all want to sleep,\nthat's the goal when we\nput our head on the pillow,\nis to actually fall asleep\nand wake up in the morning\nand not know what the hell\nhappened, unless you had a dream.\nBut you know beyond that,\nthere are certainly physical\ncomponents to sleep.\nThat is why a lot of times\npeople will wake up and say like\nthat you can incur pretty\nserious injuries in sleep.\nPeople will wake up and\nhave like a shoulder\nthat did not bother them at all,\nbe humming the next day\nor even for weeks after,\nbecause of the one sleep\nposition they put themselves in,\nin a prolonged way.\nAnd they happened to have a deep sleep,\neven through the discomfort.\nThat can do actually some damage.\nSo it's understandable\nthat the body can incur\nsome strain and stress if you're\nsleeping in the wrong way.\nOne of the things I say\nright off the bat is,\nsleeping on your stomach\njust doesn't really have many benefits.\nYou're putting yourself\ninto a position that is,\ndepending upon the\norientation of your mattress\nor how many pillows you're using,\nbut you're basically\nputting yourselves into\nexcessive extension of the lumbar spine,\nwhich for most people, isn't very good,\nif you're a disc patient, I\nguess that might be helpful,\nfor relocating the disc.\nBut I mean, for the most part,\nyour hands are then\nusually not at your sides,\nbut they're up under your arms,\nso you've got them into\nsort of internal rotation up\nover elevation in your head.\nIt's just not a great position.\nYou also have to crank your\nneck for one side or the other\nin order to breathe, or you're\ngoing to your face down,\nstraight into the pillow.\nSo I would skip that one.\nAnd there's some people that\nare total belly sleepers.\nAnd I would just say, listen,\nI don't think that is the most helpful,\nlong term way for you to sleep.\nTry to adopt a different position.\nSleeping on your side oftentimes is,\nis also brought along with that,\nthe legs knees coming\nup towards the chest,\nprolonged hip flexion.\nListen, we're doing enough\nof that during the day.\n- What we're doing right now.\n- We don't need to do another 10 hours\nor eight hours or something\nat night like that.\nAnd it just is reinforcing,\nand as we said too,\nlet's say you trained that day,\nyou're just reinforcing\nmuscle shortening overnight.\nWhere the body is healing\nand trying to create\nsome changes in your body.\nOne of the reasons why\nI recommend stretching\nor static stretching\nprior to going to bed,\na lot of people don't really\nwant to do it at that point,\n'cause it could take 10\nminutes, 5-10 minutes,\ndepending upon how many\nmuscles you have to stretch.\nBut it's good to sort of try to establish\njust longer length temporarily\nprior to going into a state where\nyou're going to be not moving\nand recovering and creating\nnew changes in the muscle.\nSo, that kind of, I don't\nsay it doesn't rule out\nthe side sleeper.\nThe side sleeper could\nbe very, very helpful\nfor somebody that has\napnea or other conditions.\nSo again, it's not an\nall or nothing approach,\nbut it's something that you\nneed to pay attention to.\nWhen you are on your back,\nlike you were talking about\nand your feet are wedged\nunderneath a tight sheets\nat the end of the bed.\nAnd most of us, unless we\nconsciously are pulling them up,\ndon't prefer our beds to\nhave really loose sheets\nat the end of the bed.\n- It's hard to make\nthe bed in the morning.\n- So it's like you you're going\nto want to have them tight.\nWell, I'm saying as you experienced,\nyou're going to have these\nprolonged plant reflection,\nthat's going to likely lead\nto shorter calves over time\nbecause you're lacking all that length\nfor that long period of\ntime that you could have\nif you just loosened up the sheets\nand allowed your feet to\njust hang out where they are.\nNow, the resting position of the ankle\nis not endorse reflection,\nit's going to be still\nin some plain reflection,\nbut not being driven down\nand pulled down into that position.\nAnd I think what happens\nactually is people who get\nuncomfortable that way,\neven in their sleep\nwill shift away from that\nby turning either onto\ntheir side of their stomach.\nSo there's definitely an\nimpact of the body position\nand sleep in figuring out the best way\nthat you can still sleep of\ncourse, and get your rest,\nbut have a mindful eye towards\nwhat it's doing to your body\nand choose the one that's\nleast abrasive to your body\nis the way you should go.\n- That's terrific, and again,\nit's really helped me and\nI'm a big believer based on good science\nout of Stanford and elsewhere that\nas much as we can be\nnasal breathers in sleep,\nwe probably should be.\nI don't know if you've\ndone any content yet about\ntaping the mouth shut\nwith some medical tape,\nbut you know the benefits\nof nasal breathing in sleep\nare pretty tremendous,\nbut it takes a little bit of\ntraining for people to do,\nand the training is very simple.\nIt's a little piece of medical tape.\nSo again, a topic for another time.\nI'm glad you mentioned stretching,\nI was going to ask about\nstretching a little bit later,\nbut let's talk about stretching.\nWhen's the best time to stretch\nfor particular types of results?\nAnd maybe you could define\nsome of the different types of stretching.\nSo you just mentioned a little bit of,\nwhat you call it, light stretching or?\nI'm completely naive here on stretching.\nSo let me just say, I\ncan think of stretching\nwhere I hold the stretch and\nreally try and \"lengthen\"\nin air quotes folks, I don't\nwant the PTs jumping all over.\nI don't know what it is,\nbut nutrition and the\nPTs online are really,\nthey've got pitchforks in both hands.\nAcademics...\n- That's a recent evolution, I think.\nAnd not the nutrition as much,\nbut the PTs have become a\nlittle bit angry these days.\n- I see, well, I always say\nwith feelings of powerlessness\ncomes aggression.\nRemember that folks.\nSo in any case, they're\nstretching where I'm\ntrying to consciously\n\"lengthen,\" again in air quotes,\nthe muscle I'm not yanking on the limb\nor bobbing up and down.\nMaybe you could define the\ndifferent types of stretching\nfor people, maybe give\nus some rough guidelines\nabout what or not to do if cold or warm,\nbefore training, after\ntraining, et cetera.\n- So, yeah, there's obviously\nthere's a lot of different\ntypes of stretching\nthat could get even to P and F stretching\nand things that are a\nlittle bit more niche.\nBut in general, the two\nbasic forms of stretching\nare active stretching\nand passive stretching,\nand your dynamic work.\nAnd your passive stretching is done\nwith the goal of trying\nto create an increase\nin the flexibility of the muscle.\nSo whether you're actually\nincreasing the length\nof that muscle, more\nso what you're doing is\nincreasing the- or decreasing\nthe resistance of that muscle\nto want to stay at a certain\nlevel of flexibility.\nSo when we can sort of take the breaks off\nand allow that muscle to\nallow us more range of motion,\nwe're inherently increasing flexibility\nwithout necessarily having\nto increase the length\nof that muscle.\nThat is usually done at a time\nfar away from your workout,\nbecause they have shown where\nthis type of stretching\ndone prior to an activity,\nand it could be like a\nstructured activity like lifting,\nor it could be a little\nbit less structured,\nlike competing in a sport\nin a spontaneous type way,\nthat there is a period of\nrecalibration that is needed\nafter doing this,\nbecause you're disrupting the\nlength tension relationship\nof the muscle that causes\nyou to not necessarily\nbe able to rely on these,\nI've talked about before,\nstored motor engrams in\nyour mind in terms of,\nthis is the pattern for how\nI swing a golf club, say.\nAnd now introducing a\nlittle bit of flexibility,\nor added flexibility, or range,\nbecause of the stretching I did before,\nit takes maybe a whole or two\nor three to match up again.\nOh, this is what he's trying to do,\nthat golf swinging thing\nthat I remembered again,\nlike it's not remembering\nthat every component,\nlike I have to bend my\nright wrist back 10 degrees,\nand then I have to bend my\nelbow and I have to break,\nlike your body stores these\npatterns for motor efficiency.\nAnd when I have to start\nmatching up that stored pattern\nwith what's feeling new\nbecause of the increased range,\nI can impair performance.\nAnd again, it could happen\neven in a gym workout\nwhere you're talking about your first,\nsecond set, third set,\nwhere maybe the\nrepercussions aren't as big,\n'cause I'll just do a few extra sets.\nBut in performance, if you screw\nup your first three rounds,\nyou're playing on a PJ tour and you shoot\nyour six over after three, you're done.\nSo I think it matters there.\nAs far as the dynamic, so we\nrelegate that as I mentioned,\nsort of towards the end of the day\nwhen it's not going to impact performance,\nbut even maybe have the\nadditional benefit of creating\nthe feeling of length or\nthe increase or decrease\nin resistance to this length\nat a time when I know\nmy body is going to try\nto tend to heal and heal shorter,\nnever longer, but heal shorter.\nSo if I can introduce a little\nbit of that extra length\nor decreased resistance to that length,\nit's a better time to do it.\nSo I think it promotes a better recovery.\nIf I want to...\n- Sorry to interrupt, but so\nstretching later in the day,\nbecause I'm intrigued by\nthis concept of heal shorter.\nSo part of the healing\nand recovery process\nmeans the shortening of the muscles.\nThis is the tensing up in sleep.\n- Yes, yeah.\n- Could you elaborate\njust a bit on that and then\nsorry to break your flow,\nbut then to continue...\n- No, just basically,\nwhat's been shown is that,\nwhen the repair process,\nmuscular repair from,\nlet's say strength\ntraining during the day,\nthe repair process usually\nresults in a muscle\nthat is slightly shorter rather\nthan increased in length.\nIt's just, muscles prefer to sort of\nratchet their way down\ninto that contraction,\nand then maintain that more comfortable\nlength tension relationship.\nSo when you're sleeping,\nit tends to air on the side of shorter\nrather than longer, when ideally\nwe don't really want that.\nWe want to maintain as much of that length\nbecause with more length, we\nactually have more leverage.\nThat muscle has more leverage to contract.\nIf it was all the way contracted,\nyou really can't obviously\nwe know generate much force\nin a muscle that's already\nmaximally contracted.\nSo I think we want to do something\nthat we, whatever we can,\nwhatever little weapons\nwe have in our arsenal\nthat could allow us to\ndo this prior to sleep.\nAnd again, it's just making\nit a conscious choice\nto do it at a time of the day\nthat makes a little bit more sense.\nDynamic stretching is really\nnot done for that purpose\nof trying to create any\ntype of feeling of act\nor increasing the potential length\nas you said of the muscle,\nbut more so the readiness\nof the muscle to perform.\nAnd increasing exploring the\nends of that range of motion\nin a more dynamic way so\nyou're not hanging out there\nin disrupting that length\ntension relationship\nbut just sort of touching\nthe ends of those barriers\nso that when you feel movement\nagain, it feels looser,\nit feels more ready.\nAnd obviously at the same\ntime warming up blood flow,\nall the benefits we get from\njust warming up in general.\nSo like that's the series\nyou've probably seen a\nbunch of times but like\nleg swings and butt kicks\nand lunge, walking lunges\nand all types of-\n- Toe touches.\n- Toe touches, all those kind of drills,\nthose active stretching drills\nor lunging with rotations\nfor the upper body\nto try to get some of the\nthoracic spine involved too.\nThose are the drills that\npeople will do prior to training\nthat are both excitatory\nin terms of just the nervous system\nbut also helpful for just\nthe general warm up the body\n'cause the blood flow.\nBut from a muscle readiness standpoint\nnot impairing the performance\nwhile at the same time\nexploring the increased ranges\n'cause as you know the\nfirst toe touch you do\nis not as high as the\nlast toe touch you do.\n- For me it doesn't even include the toe.\n- The shin touch.\n- The touch attempt.\n- So like those are going to improve\nwith each subsequent rep\nand I think that's what people actually,\nwhen you can see those,\nthose actual changes from\nrep one to rep seven,\nyou just feel ready,\nyou feel more alert and\nready to go in your workout.\nSo the dynamic type of stretching\nand I mentioned earlier on\nwhat I've had to do to sort\nof increase my warm up focus.\nI think that's more of what\nI try to do these days.\nI try to be a little bit\nmore alert to the fact that,\nmy body's not ready.\nWhen I was working with\nAntonio Brown I remember like\nhe would spend 20 minutes, 30\nminutes on all dynamic work.\nAnd I've never seen\nanybody spend that long\non their dynamic work.\nBut like he said, he just\ndidn't feel right and ready\nto go unless he did a lot of that.\nAnd I mean his dynamic stretching routine\nwould be a workout for most everybody.\nAnd it's crazy how much he did.\n- These pro athletes are amazing.\nAnd you've had the great\nfortune of working with\nand improving their abilities.\nBut I can only imagine\n'cause I also imagine he is\npretty strong in the gym also.\n- I mean, it always amazes me\nthe guys that make it to that level\nno matter what sport they do.\nThey're so gifted in everything.\nLike David Wright used to\nmake me laugh all the time\nwith the Mets because no matter what I,\nPing pong, like anything\nbecause of his hand-eye coordination.\nLike anything great at.\nJump rope.\nI remember he hadn't\ndone a lot of jump rope\nand I think jump rope's\none of the best things\nyou could do from a\nconditioning standpoint.\nIt's actually fairly\ninteresting, it's not just,\nit's not too harsh on the joints\neven though it's a ballistic\nmove and he wasn't-\nI have to admit, if he listens to this,\nhe's going to want to kill me,\nbut I was better at him at jump roping.\nOne of the only things I could do.\nAnd then I gave him about five days\nand he completely blew me out of the water\nto the point where I could\nnever keep up with him anymore.\nHe made it look effortless.\nIt's like that's where the\nathlete in someone comes out.\nNo matter what they pick\nup, they're good at it.\nAnd I think that when you\nsee guys like this in the gym\nlike their strength levels\ntend to be pretty damn good\nand their abilities, their\ncoordination, their everything\njust tends to sort of\nbe good at that level.\nAnd it sort of amazes me.\nWhy those guys can go pick up\na golf club and go shoot 72\nand having never really played.\nThey're just naturally\ngood at whatever they do.\n- Yeah, I have a couple,\nI'm smiling 'cause I have a\ncouple really close friends\nwho did a number of years\nsome several decades in the SEAL teams.\nAnd I don't know that their\nskill level at everything\nis so high as you're\ndescribing for athletes\nbut their level of\ncompetitiveness is beyond.\nI ocean swam with one,\nthere's no chance that I'm\ngoing to right out swim Pat\never, ever.\nHe actually goes back and forth sometimes\njust to check up on\nme, which I appreciate.\nThank you Pat.\nI haven't drowned yet.\nBut in addition to that,\nwe could play horseshoes\nand it's like this switch\nthat just flips on,\nlike he's going to murder me.\nOf course he's a very nice guy, right?\nIn general, they tend to be very nice.\nBut the level of competitiveness\nis kind of unreal.\nThey're selected for it.\n- They're trying to beat themselves\nthey're not even trying to beat you.\n- That's right, I'm not\neven in the competition.\n- You're not even there.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nThank you.\nNow I won't feel so bad or worse.\nIt's true, it's a remarkable thing.\nI'm glad you mentioned jump roping.\nI used to skip rope for warmup for boxing,\nlike three minute rounds\nor something like that.\nBut I'm glad you brought it up because\nskipping rope is something that\nobviously has a cardiovascular component,\nthere's the conditioning\ncomponent, there's timing\nand it is kind of interesting, right?\nIt's frustrating when you don't get it\nespecially when it whips you on the air\nif you're using a proper rope.\nI'm just curious if you\ncould just give us a quick\nskipping rope 101.\nDo you like to see people\njumping with both feet and toes?\nWe'll link to a video if\nthere was one and I missed it.\nDo you like to see\npeople doing high knees?\nDo you like people\nbasically like shuffling?\nYou want to see people doing double Dutch?\nWhat do you want to see\npeople doing over time?\n- All of the above maybe\nnot the double Dutch,\nbut all of the above.\nI mean, I think that's the\ncool thing about it, right?\nLike once we sort of master\nthe skill 'cause for all of us,\nthat first jump with the\ntwo feet going together\nis a challenge.\n'Cause you just got to time that rope,\nyou got to time your jump\nand then we get bored as\nwe often do as humans,\nwe get bored with what we can do\nand we want to take on new challenges\nso then it becomes one leg at a time\nor then it becomes side\nto side hops, right?\nAll of those things are\nbeneficial I believe\nneurologically to enhancing the ability\nto do the skill as a whole\nbut also just because\nI'm such a believer in\ntraining in all three planes.\nSo like just doing straight up and down\nversus now I can do frontal\nplane side to side motion\nand then I can even do small little twists\nor core screws you call them.\nIt requires a different,\nyou would know more better than I do\nthat it requires different\nneurological patterns\nto be able to coordinate\nthat because you're changing\nthe orientation of your body in space.\nSo it's not just them\nchanging the exercise\nbut I'm changing how my body\ninterprets that exercise\nbecause what's happening\nto my body in space.\nSo I love whatever people wind up doing,\nbut I am amazed there are people,\nI just started following\nthis young woman on Instagram\nwho is like, I'll give her a plug out,\nI think it's like @anna.skips or something\nand she is ridiculous.\nLike I watch her and I'm like mesmerized\nat what she can do with the rope.\nIt's like is an extremely\nathletic endeavor\nbelieve when it gets to be at that level\nand the speed and the precision and the-\nI think one of the goals that\nyou want to be able to have is\nto where you're feeling\nas if you're almost\neffortlessly dancing without a rope.\nLike where you're just\nbouncing off of the ball\nof your foot.\nAnd it's an important skill to learn too\nwhether you go back to run\nor even even jog, right?\nJust like more casual running,\nlearning how to land is so important.\nOne of the drills that\npeople should try is like,\ntry to jump on your heels.\nSo just stand up, pull your\ntoes off the ground, right?\nAnd just jump from your\nheels and land on your heels.\nYou'll feel it in your jaw.\nYou'll literally feel your jaw rattle\nwhen you land on your heels.\nThere is no shock absorption capabilities\nthrough your heels.\nMeantime, a lot of people\nland on their heels a lot\nwhen they run and you're just,\nyour body's not built to absorb the forces\nlike the ball of your foot could.\nIt's really built as a spring.\nAnd the foot is a, to me\nas a physical therapist,\nthe foot has always been\none of the most amazing,\nyou talk about having\nbad feet I have flat feet\nit looks like I got flippers\nif I took my shoes off.\nLike I'm wearing scuba fins.\nThere is no-\nThere is no adaptability of\nthat foot to the surface.\nWhen it's completely caved\nand flattened like that,\nthe job of the foot is to be a adaptable.\nWell, maybe there is some adaptability\nbecause it's so floppy, but\nat the same time at some point\nthat critical junction when\nyou're going to then step through\nand you need to be able to push off\nthe foot has to actually\nchanges in the midfoot itself\nto become a rigid lever\nis what they call it.\nYou're going from a mobile\nadapter to a rigid lever.\nThat rigid lever literally\nlocks up the metatarsal joint\nto become solid\nso that you can push\noff of it with leverage.\nIf you lack that capability,\nall those stresses that are\nsupposed to be born by the foot,\ngo up into the ankle, into\nthe knee, into the hip,\ninto the low back.\nSo learning how to land and\nstart to train your body\nto experience ground\nreaction forces the right way\nis so critical to all other function\nand all other disability\nof the kinetic chain\nand jumping rope is like\none of the best ways\nto learn how to do that.\n- Great.\nI own a jump rope I love\ndoing it in the morning\nwhile I get sunlight in my eyes.\nIt's actually a protocol I\npicked up from Tim Ferris\nwho mentioned 'cause\nlisteners in my podcast know\nI'm like a broken record with\nget sunlight in your eyes\neven through cloud cover it's\njust sets your sleep rhythms\nand your waking rhythms\nof yada yada on and on.\nBut sometimes it'd be\nkind of boring for people\nand I want to get them off their phone.\nSo jumping rope is also\njust a great way to wake up.\nSo jumping rope can be the cardio workout,\nthe 15, 30 minutes.\n- Definitely.\nAnd there's sort of that hybrid\nthat we were talking about before of like,\nyou're not necessarily\ndropping down to the ground\nand doing burpees,\nbut I just look at it as\na more athletic endeavor\nbecause of the coordination involved\nthan just simply walking or jogging.\n- Yeah, and it's not much\nof equipment requirement.\nVery minimal cost.\nYou could even use a rope\nor something if you...\n- We even instruct people\nthey could use no rope\nand just pretend and just\nmove the arms, right?\n- Truly zero cost.\n- You're never going to\nhit the rope which is good\nbut at the same time,\nSo you're never going to know\nif you're doing it wrong,\nbut at least you can move through that\nand get the same benefits\nthrough the feet.\n- I love it, I love it.\nI told myself before\nsitting down with you today\nthat I wasn't going to\nfocus on specific exercises\nbecause there's such a\nwealth of incredible content\nthat you put out there\nthat people could just put\ninto YouTube or elsewhere\nand arrive at the proper\nway to do a chin or a dip,\nfor whatever purpose.\nBut there's one exercise\nand one particular motion\nthat I'd like to discuss for a moment\nbecause I believe that\nlearning about this\ncautionary note from you\nis one of the reasons\nthat I've maintained steady\ntraining for 30 years\nwith no major injury knock on wood\nand that's the upright row.\nOne thing that whether\nyou weight train or not.\n- Do we censor this podcast?\nI mean censoring, do we\nbeep this out or not?\n- I do.\nDo you get beef about this?\n- No.\nYou know what, we always get beef\nin any social media platform\nwhere we're put out.\nBut like, no, I guess\nsome, I get some from it,\nbut I'm fully prepared to defend myself.\n- But here's the reason\nfor asking about this.\nI never really cared much for upright rows\nit's not an exercise I tend to do.\nBut one thing that's apparent\nin all my colleagues,\nin every child I see, in\nevery adult I see is that\nalmost everybody is in\ninward rotation now.\nSo folks think if you stay,\nI think I learned this from you also,\nif you stand up straight\nand then you just point your thumbs out,\nlike a thumbs up but your hands are down\nyou're pointing your thumbs straight out,\nideally they would go straight out.\nMost people the thumbs\nare going to be pointing\ntoward one another\nbecause most people are starting\nto look somewhere between\na non human primate and a melted candle.\nBent at the hips, et cetera,\nfrom too much sitting,\nwe're all sitting, we're\nin an inward rotation,\nbut I learned from you\nthat the upright row\ncompromises some important\naspects of our shoulder mechanics\nand could be actually sort\nof a dangerous movement\nin some ways.\nI'm sure there's a safe\nway for people to do it.\nBut so I've always made it a point now\non the basis of this advice\nto A, not do upright rows,\nbut I wasn't doing them before\nbut to really strive for external rotation\non things like bench dips, on\na number of different things.\nWhenever I can I try and\ngo into external rotation\nprovided that without looking\nlike an idiot walking around\nwith my palms facing outward.\nPlease tell us about\ninternal external rotation.\nThe upright row is one aspect of that,\nbut why this is so important\nnot just for weight training,\nbut as in terms of posture and mechanics\nand not looking like a melted candle\nor partially melted candle.\n- I actually love it.\nI'm happy to talk about it\ncause I love the shoulder\nas a joint.\nI think PTs tend to fall\nin love with certain areas\nand the shoulder is one\nof the cool areas for me,\nit's like the foot is but like,\nthe shoulder has the most\nmobility in the body of any joint,\nbut it's also got the\nleast stability, right?\nThere's always that trade off\nof mobility and stability.\nSo your stability comes\nfrom certain muscle groups\nand 101 is that the only muscle group\nthat actually externally\nrotates the shoulder\nis going to be the rotator cuff, okay.\nAnd unless you are devoted to training\nthrough external rotation\nand exercises that\nare going to externally\nrotate the shoulder,\nyou're not training that function.\nAnd it's so easy for us in everyday life\nespecially those that aren't training\nto not ever really undergo\nany of those stresses\nthat could be beneficial to counteracting\nwhat happens freely and naturally,\nwhich is internal rotation.\nSo when you think about\nthe imbalance created\njust by nature and how we live our lives,\ninternal rotation far, far, far\noutweighs external rotation.\nSo you need to address it.\nAnd the reason why you need\nto address it is because\nyou need to normalize those\nbiomechanics to the shoulder\nif you want their long term health.\nAnd one of the functions of the shoulder\nis to raise our arm up over our head.\nAnd if we do that from an\ninternally rotated position,\nwe're going to have a higher likelihood\nof creating stress inside that joint.\nFunny thing is I talked\nabout before my PT brethren\nwho can be somewhat angry these days,\nI don't know what\nhappened, but fairly angry.\nThey want to discredit the\nexistence of something like\nshoulder impingement,\nwhich I don't know how,\nI mean, certain studies,\nlook, we both all read studies\nand studies will say one thing one day\nand potentially conflict entirely\nin a different direction.\nSome studies will point\nto the non-existence\nof a shoulder impingement.\nMeanwhile, we have thankfully\ndigital motion x-rays\nthat will literally show the\nimpingement occur in real time,\nin real function.\nAnd that's one of the limitations\nI'm off on a tangent here,\nbut like those types of x-rays\nor that type of fluoroscopy\nthat we have nowadays,\nlike gives us such insight\nthat we never had before\n'cause we're taking static x-rays\nof someone laying down on a table.\nWell, I want to see what happens\nwhen you actually raise my arm\nup over my head in function\nand the tools now exist to do that.\nWe see the problems occurring because\nin order to get normal mechanics\nand free up the joint maximally inside\nyou need to externally rotate\nas you raise the arm up.\nSo if your muscles aren't firing\nand they're not necessarily as strong\nas the internal rotation\nbias that pulls them in,\nyou're asking for trouble\nevery time you do that.\nWell, this exercise is literally\nputting you in elevation\nand internal rotation.\nAnd if you were to walk into\na PT office and someone said,\n\"I think he's got impingement,\nwill you diagnose him?\"\nThere's a test called\na Hawkins Kennedy Test.\nAnd I would put you in the position\nI know we're not visible at\nthis point through the podcast,\nbut I'll put you in this position here\nwhere I have your arm elevated\nand your hand pretty much under your chin\npushing downward on that\nto create that internal shoulder rotation.\nPretty much the exact\nposition that we're in\nwhen we're holding a\nbar in an upright row.\nSome will say, well, just don't go so high\ngoing up to the level of the chest,\nbut you're still in this\ninternally rotated position.\nThe thing that I think\nfrustrates me the most\nabout the exercise is\nthat I have an alternative\nand the alternative does the same thing\nin terms of helping the muscles grow\nby simply fixing the\nbiomechanics of the exercise\nby just allowing the hands\nto go higher than the elbows.\nSo instead of the elbows\nbeing higher than the hand\nwhich drives you into internal rotation,\nif the elbow is lower than the hand,\nthe hand being higher here,\nI'm in external rotation.\nAnd I could do something\ncalled a high pull\nand still get the same\nabduction of the arm\nand still get the same\nbenefits of the shoulders,\nthe delts and the traps\nwithout having to undergo\nany of the stresses\nthat would come from\nthe somewhat awkward\nmovement of an upright row.\n- And for those listening,\nwe'll put a link to a short\nclip of what this looks like.\nBut basically what Jeff is doing\nand tell me if I'm describing\nthis incorrectly or correctly.\nJeff is taking your two thumbs\nand pointing behind you,\nso elbows up kind of near the chin\nand pointing behind you\nlike, oh, headed that way.\nLike somebody directing the\nairplane, like come back,\ncome back and back.\nI forget what they call that.\nI think it's called semaphorin,\nis the action of like where\nthey direct the planes\nor something the flags or whatever.\nSomeone will, of course tell\nme I'm wrong about that too,\nwhich is why I say these things\nbecause I like being told\nwhat the correct answer is.\nIn any case, so this\nreplaces the upright row\nand probably does a number\nof other important things as well.\n- Well, again, listen, without\nnaming names or programs\nor anything like that.\nWhen I got involved in, when\nI got involved in Athlean-X,\nwhen I first my online presence,\nthere was a very, very,\nvery popular program\nthat was out there that I just\nfor fun I wanted a as a PT,\nis the nerdy things we do,\nbut I wanted to evaluate\nthe workout structure.\nAnd I went and I looked at every rep\nover the course of a week.\nAnd there was something\nlike 890 repetitions\nor something done\nand zero of them were\ndedicated external rotation\nin the shoulder.\nSo if you think about it, I mean,\nagain, it was a very popular program\nthat was done by a lot of people.\nThere was no focus at all,\nno dedicated focus towards creating\na balance to an action\nthat is so predominant.\nAnd remember, it's not just\nbecause we sit with bad posture,\nbut the fact that our chest\ncan internally rotate,\nour latch can internally rotate,\nthere's like muscle, other\nbig muscles that participate\nin things that we do every day\nthat will further internally\nrotate the shoulder.\nThe only weapons we have\nfor external rotation\nare those little rotator cuff muscles\nand three of them actually\nthree of the four.\nAnd the job is to sort of\nactively and consciously train them\nthrough really the\nboring exercises, right?\nLike you've seen them with the band,\nyou anchor a band to a pole,\nyou stand with the band\nin the opposite hand.\nSo if it's anchored to\nthe pole on my left side\nI've got the band on my right side\nand you see people where they\nkind of rotate their hand\ntowards the back.\nAgain, kind of what you were saying\nbut at a lower elevation\ntaking the back of my hand\nand trying to point it\nto somebody behind me.\nWell, that is one of the\nways to train the muscle.\nIt's just a one function of the shoulder,\nexternal rotation of the\nshoulder and you need to do it.\nAnd again, it's not that\nif somebody was doing more\nexternal rotation work\ncould they absorb the upright row better?\nProbably, because as\nthey elevated the arm,\nthey probably have a little\nbit more of a contribution\nfrom the rotator cuff to\nwhat one of the functions is\nto centralize the head\nof the humorous inside\nof the glenoid, the capsule.\nSo as it rises up, it stays central\nas opposed to migrating up\nbecause the deltoid likes to pull up.\nSo if the rotator cuff has\nsome ability to counteract\nthe upward pull of a del\nthen it can maintain a\nmore healthy relationship\nwith overhead movement.\nSo just realizing that that function\nis only gained through\ndoing these exercises,\nwe would probably\ndedicate more time there,\nthe upright row might be\nbetter absorbed by that person\n'cause they have a\nlittle bit more strength.\nBut again, why?\nBecause if you have an exercise\nthat does the same thing\nfor what you're trying to do muscularly,\nto build the muscles that it affects,\nwhy wouldn't you just do\nit where you can still see\nactually pick up more\nrepetitions of external rotation?\nSo you're getting none of\nthe harm all of the benefits.\nI see zero reason to\never do the upright row\nand people will argue, this\nis the way they argue that,\nI've done this for 30 years\nand I've never hurt myself.\nAnd I always say yet, yet.\nLike, listen, the goal is\nto not hurt yourself ever.\nSo even if you, it's sort of\nlike the championship game.\nYou might play the game of your life,\nbut if you lose you lost.\nAnd when you get into the\nend of the record books,\nyou still lost.\nSo even if you had the\ngame in your life you lost,\nI don't care if you do\nit for 30 years, no pain,\nyou're still doing it and there's no pain\nI'm giving you an option\nthat's going to give you the same results\nin the exercise that you're seeking.\nThat's why you're doing the exercise\nwithout the possibility of\nhaving the the bad outcome\ncome from it.\nSo I get a little bit\ndefensive of the move,\nbut I feel like it's like,\nwhy would you do that?\n- No, it makes me say,\nbeing able to train for a long\nperiod of time and feel good.\nI'm proud to say and I don't have\nthe kind of genetics where\nlike we don't have a lot of\nimpressive athletes in our\nfamily tree or anything.\nIt's some fit individuals\nsome less fit individuals,\nbut I really believe\nit's about putting in the\nwork consistently over time.\nAnd the more often you can\nwake up not in pain the better.\nAnd so I think that being\nin external rotation\nas often as possible is good.\nThis is actually a good friend\nwho's a yoga teacher told me\nthis is also a problem with the yogis,\nall the downward dog stuff.\nFor those listening,\nyou can think of inward\nrotation as like thumbs down.\nJust think thumbs down\nand rotation isn't bad\nbut less thumbs down more\nthumbs up is external rotation.\nSo for those just listening,\nmaybe that gives a visual.\nThe more exercise you can\ndo in external rotation\nthe better it seems on average.\nI'd love to chat with you\njust a little bit more about\nbiomechanics, and this is a\npersonal thing that again,\nyour content really helped solve for me.\nOne is I thought I had lower back pain,\nthat I had sciatica so\nbadly that on a few trips\nWork trips years ago\nwhen I was doing a lot\nmore international travel.\nI mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes.\nI mean like excruciating pain.\nI didn't want to take medication,\nI didn't want to do back surgery.\nIn the end, turns out it\nwasn't a back injury at all.\nAnd one of the things that\nhelped fix it was this\njust learning about this\nthing called the medial glute.\nAnd you had a video that\nsaid fixed back pain\nand then you quite accurately say that\nsome back pain isn't really\nabout the back at all.\nAnd had me do an exercise or\nallowed me to try an exercise\nwhere I lay on my side and\nessentially pointing my toe down\nthe top toe down, almost\nlike pointing a toe down\nand then would slowly lift the leg up\nwhile pointing the toe down.\nMaybe I got it...\n- No, you got it good.\n- And then holding that,\nand there's a muscle that sort of sits\nat the top of the glute\nit kind of peaks out\nevery once in a while.\nYou can feel it there with your thumb,\nwhich is I think you had push back on it.\nA bit creating that mind muscle link again\nand there with proprioception,\nthe actual feeling of a\nmuscle literally with a limb,\nwe know based on the neural\ncircuits for movement,\nthat that enhances the\ncontractibility of a muscle.\nSo like if you touch your bicep,\nyou literally can contract\nit more more strongly.\nAnd this makes total sense based on\nneuromuscular physiology.\nSo had me do that repeatedly.\nAnd I started doing that in my hotel room\nand the pain started to disappear.\nAnd then it came back again the afternoon\nso I did it again in the afternoon.\nSo this is something I\ndid for three or four days\nand lo and behold a back pain's gone.\nI handed this off to my father\nbecause he like me has a\nslightly lower right shoulder.\nI think that our gate is\nprobably thrown off by this.\nIt's probably a genetic thing, who knows.\nHe handed off to somebody.\nIt turns out that we don't\nsuffer from back pain\nand in fact, now I don't\nsuffer from any pain\nbecause I was doing this exercise\nwhich I think is helping my medial glute.\nTwo reasons why I raised this.\nOne, I know a lot of guys who\nhave this right side sciatica\n'cause people keep the\nwallet there is one idea\nor left side sciatica.\nThere are a lot of people male and female\nwho think they have back pain\nwhen they don't actually have back pain.\nAnd the other thing is that\nis a general question about biomechanics\nor statement about biomechanics.\nI had of a feeling\nthat a lot of what people\nthink is back pain or knee pain\nor neck pain or headache or shoulder pain\nis actually the consequence\nof something that's happening\nabove or below that site of pain.\nAnd this is a whole landscape\nof stuff related to PT\nand recovery and pain management.\nBut maybe if you could just\neducate us a bit on this\nand why this works, what\nis the medial glute?\nWhy did it make my so-called\nback pain disappear?\nAnd how should people think about pain?\nAnd I'd like to use this as a segue\nto get into a little bit deeper discussion\nabout pain and recovery.\n- Sure.\nSo this is definitely like a\nbig cornucopia PT stuff here,\nbut like and this is what I love.\nSo first of all, that video,\nit's my proudest video that I have.\nAnd the reason being is that\nit's helped so many people.\nLike we get comments on\nthat video every day.\nI don't even know how\nmany views it's got now,\n30 some what million.\n- We will link to it.\n- There's a lot of views.\nAnd quite honestly,\nit was a little bit of\nan afterthought video\nin terms of it's origin.\nI think that that day maybe\nJesse was having some problems\nor something like that, a\nlittle bit of low back pain\nand I showed him and it helped\nright away and he was like,\nwell, we can make a video on it\n'cause this will help people.\nNot everybody, if you\nhave a real disc problem,\nit's not going to help\nbecause you're not changing\nthe structural problem\nthat's there.\nBut as you said, a lot of people don't\nand even disc issues a lot\nof them are non-operative.\nSo you'd want to try these things first.\nAs far as what you're sort of experienced\nsometimes as that glute\nmedias really tightens down\nand that's again, from poor biomechanics\nup and down the kinetic chain,\nit can actually press on the sciatic nerve\nand give you what they\ncall a pseudo sciatica.\nWhere it's not like you're making it up,\nit's not like you're not feeling that pain\nover that same sciatic distribution,\nbut it's not caused from a disc,\nit's not caused from\nsomething mechanical there,\nit's caused by the fact that this gluteus\nhas posturely become a\nproblem for you or weak\nbecause you don't train it\nand you need to address it.\nSo, unlike any other muscle in the body,\nthere are common trigger\npoints in common areas where\nthe muscle will become\ntightened or painful or spasmed\nand you can basically apply\npressure to these areas\nand then sort of thread that\nmuscle through the pressure\nby pushing down through there and then\ncontracting the muscle which is why\nyou go through that action of,\nI think we call it toast stabber,\nbut like stabbing down and lifting up\nand stabbing down and lifting up.\nTaking that glute medias\nthrough its function.\nSo it's basically kind of working\nunderneath the downward\npressure of the finger\nand that tends to help\nyou to almost need out\nwhat might be that trigger point.\nAnd that's why people can\nsee immediate relief there\nbecause once the trigger\npoint lets go, it feels like,\nand that's what the\ncomments are in that video.\nLike my God, I literally, I couldn't walk,\nI've been on my hotel floor,\nI did this and I'm fixed.\nAnd meanwhile then it could come back\nbecause your body is like,\nwell, I like being more like this.\nThis is how I've been ingrained to be.\nSo it might come back\nbut then when you do another round of it\nand another round of it and\nthen finally it starts to say,\nall right, I'm not going\nto do that anymore.\nIt kind of eases up and\nyou can relieve yourself\nof those trigger points.\nYou could do that up and down the back.\nThere's other people that get that\nand that sort of inside\ntheir shoulder blade,\nthat same type of\ncramping in another area.\nBut once that takes place,\nwell, then the job that\nI think people have\nis like become educated that\nthe glute medias is different\nthan the glute maximus.\nLike their functions are different.\nYou have to work on not\njust extending the hip\nbut also abduction of the hip.\nExternal rotation of the hip,\nsame thing as in the shoulder.\nAnd this actually segues nicely into what,\ninto the whole concept\nyou were talking about.\nLike the body is like a mirror image.\nThe hip is like the shoulder, right?\nThe ankle is the wrist.\nThe foot is the hand.\nThe knee is the elbow,\nthey're two hinge joints,\nthey function that way.\nWell, with the shoulder, you've got that\nmobility that comes from having\nall that freedom of motion\nbut the stability is lacking.\nWell, the same thing with the\nhip, like you've got mobility,\nbut if you don't fully stabilize it\nby training all the muscles of the hip\nand if you don't strengthen\nthe external rotation\nof the hip, then you're\ngoing to have issues.\nLike it's not biomechanically\ngoing to work the same way.\nIf you think of the body\nas a series of bands\npulling in different directions\nat different levels of tension,\nyou're being pulled into\none direction or the other\njust by the balance of tension\nfrom one weak area to one\ndominantly tight area.\nAnd you need to make sure that\nyou can sort of balance this out\nin order to eliminate\nsome of the adaptations\nand compensations that happen.\nSo what I say, when we look at\nsort of the body as a whole,\nmost often wherever\nyou're feeling the pain\nis absolutely not to blame.\nThere's not to blame.\nIt is somewhere above or\nbelow as you hint to that.\nYou're talking about, the knee\nis my favorite example of it.\nWhenever you have knee\npain, patella tendonitis\nwhich I have forever.\nI've had bad, bad cases\nof tendonitis where\nsquatting is very difficult for me.\nIt's not the knee, the knee is\nliterally a hinge joint that\nthere's minor rotation\ncapabilities in the knee\nbut it's a hinge joint.\nAnd it's being impacted\nby the hip and the ankle\nand the foot, as I said before,\nhow critical the foot is.\nIf you thought of the knee being\nlike the middle of a train track,\nwhere the femur down your thigh\nand your shin down below your\nknee, where the train track,\nwell, what would happen if the\nfoot collapses at the bottom?\nAll of a sudden that\ntrain track on the bottom\ngets torqued just a little bit.\nWell, who's going to feel that the most,\nthe area where it's torquing,\nwhich is at the knee.\nSo the stresses are going to be felt there\nmeanwhile the problem is the foot\nor the problem is the ankle.\nPeople that are chronic ankle sprainers\nare almost always going to\nwind up having back pain\nbecause the ankle sprain causes weakness\nin mal adaptations in the ankle\nthat then gets connected\nthrough the chain.\nBecause now once I distort\nthe ankle and the shin,\nnow the knee is trying to maintain\nits ability to hinge smoothly.\nSo it toques on the femur to do that.\nWell, the femur is now\ninside the hip joint\npulling on the pelvis and\nthe pelvis is out of whack.\nIt's really is fascinating.\nLike it's one of my favorite things about\nhow the body works is like\nhow interconnected it is\nand how one little thing somewhere\ncauses repercussion somewhere else.\nAnd the easiest way to find\nout what your problem is,\nis to say, okay, I know\nwhere my symptom is,\nbut I got to find someone who can help me\nfind the source somewhere else,\nbecause it is going to be\nusually either above or below.\nMostly, usually below\n'cause it usually translates\nup the kinetic chain.\nBut usually it's going to be\nbelow where the real source is.\nSo people with low back\npain usually have hip issues\nweaknesses, tightnesses,\nflexibility issues,\nit's almost always below.\nWhen you get into really high\nperformance athletics though,\nit almost works the other way.\nLike where we have pitchers, who can't,\nI'm always fascinated by guys\nthat have Tommy John issues\nin their elbow, right?\nPitchers.\nLike if you can't externally\nrotate the shoulder\nthat we talked about, again,\nthe ability to get your shoulder back\ninto external rotation.\nWell, your arm has to\nget to a certain position\nfor release of the baseball.\nAnd if it can't get there,\nif you can't externally rotate\nthe shoulder to get there\nthen the elbow has to sort of torque more\nin order to allow the\narm to get back further.\nAnd it will try to take\nsome of that motion\nfrom a joint that's not really,\nagain, it is the hinge joint,\nreally capable of doing that.\nSo it starts to stress\nthat media level ligament\nto get a little bit further back\nbecause the shoulder's not working\nand that just ultimately\nplaces strain on the elbow.\nSo when you see a guy that has pain\nthat floats around, a pitcher\nthat floats around their arm,\nall that is is sort of this\nbalance of compensation.\nOnce his elbow starts hurting,\nthen he can't get the\nrange from the elbow,\nso he tries to dig a\nlittle bit further back\ninto external rotation\nand then the rotator cuff gets inflamed\nand then he feels that's inflamed,\nand by the way, during that time period,\nit takes some of the strain off the elbow\nso the elbow feels better.\nThen he decides, okay, now\nI got the extra rotation,\nbut I'm getting too much of that\nso now he starts straining the elbow again\nand then keeps going through this cycle.\nSo your body is very smart\nand it's going to compensate\nevery single time.\nIt's going to find the compensation\nbut there's no guarantee\nthat that compensation\ndoesn't leave you with a\nwhole host of other issues.\n- Yeah, it's fascinating.\nIn another lifetime, I\nwould've gone and been a PT\nalthough it sounds like the\ncommunity among PTs online...\n- I don't know what they,\nlisten, we're good people but it's like...\n- Yeah, scientists and neuroscientists\ncan get into pretty intense battles.\nComing from the academic community,\nthe etiquette is so different\nonline because I would say,\nI think in person\npeople would probably\nbehave a bit differently.\n- They shake your hand and say, hello.\n- Yeah, they shake your\nhand and say, hello.\nAnd there's also, look, I'll\njust be very direct about this.\nThere are a lot of people online for whom\ntheir only content is pointing\nout the misunderstandings\nor alleged flaws of other people.\nIt's like the bulk of their identity.\nWhich to me is sort of a sad existence\nbut there's always more\nto gain by thinking about\nwhat's possible, and\nwhat's new and what's good.\nBut teach their own demise or win.\n- I mean questioning what's\nout there is healthy,\nit's normal, is great, it\nactually sparks conversation.\nBut as you said, some people's existence\nis solely to find things to nag about\nand not actually with the goal\nbeing to advance anything,\nbut rather just to.\n- Yeah, in the world of science\nbeing skeptical but not\ncynical is encouraged.\nBut I always say that\nthe longer that somebody's\nin a career path\nthat's certainly in science or medicine\nand they realize how hard\nit is to do various studies.\nOnce they publish a few studies,\ngenerally they sort of get\na better understanding of\nhow the various things are done.\nIn any case, along the lines\nof pain and pain relief\nand misunderstandings about the\norigins of pain in the body,\none of the great tools that\nI picked up from your content\nwhich is benefit I know a\nhuge number of people is\nI think I used to hold weights\nsometimes in the tips of my fingers\nas opposed to in the meat\nor the palm of my hands.\nAnd I had elbow pain.\nAnd I always thought that,\nI felt it most on tricep\nexercises and pushing exercise\nand I thought I was doing\nthose exercises wrong.\nTurns out toward the end of\nmy pull ups or my bicep work,\nI was letting the weight or the bar\ndrift into my fingertips.\nAnd the mere shift\nto making sure that my\nknuckles were well over the bar\nor that the weight was really\nin the meat of my palms\nhas completely ameliorated that\nfor reasons that you point out\nand maybe you could just\nshare with us why that is\nyou have this kind of\nfinger pull exercise.\nUsually when someone says, pull my finger,\nit's like a bad middle school\nor elementary school joke...\n- Yeah, we would say push your finger.\n- [Andrew] Right, right.\n- You know this is fascinating.\nThis is because it just shows again\nhow intricate the body is\nand how responsive or\nover responsive it can be\nto something so little.\nAnd what you're talking about\nis that when you grip a bar\nwhether it be through a curl\nor whether it be through-\nAnd this is mostly\npulling exercises because\nthe tendency for the bar is going to be to\nfall out of your hand not\nlike with a pushing exercise\nwhere it's kind of you're\npushing your hand into the bar.\nSo on a bench press say.\nThat bar can drift just\nby gravity doing its thing\nor fatigue of the hand grip strength.\nCan start to drift further\naway towards the distal digits.\nThrough those last couple knuckles\nthat we have on our hands.\nAnd though our hand can\nstill hold it there,\nthe muscles are not equipped\nto handle those types of loads.\nAnd that can start at a very,\nI'm not going to say light,\nbut like it could start\nat dumbbell weight.\n40 pounds, 30 pounds, even\n25 pounds or something\ndepending upon their\noverall strength levels.\nBut then when you start to\napply it to something like\nyour body weight with a chin up, right?\n'Cause that's natural for\nthe bar to somewhat kind of\nfloat down towards your fingertips.\nAnd it actually is a little bit easier\nto perform the exercise with\nthat sort of like false script\nlittle hook grip at the end\nbecause you're not going\nto engage the forearms\ninto the exercise, you're not\ngoing to start pulling down.\nBut at the same time while it\ncould help you to perform them\nbetter by getting the back more activated,\nif you have weakness in these muscles.\n'Cause it's not a thing\nthat happens to every,\nit's not one of those\nupright road type things\nwhere I think this is\nhappening to everybody.\nThis is happening to people\nthat have these inherent\nweaknesses in these muscles.\nYou or haven't done enough of the gripping\nin the meat of the hand for long enough\nbut it starts to put that\nstress on these muscles\nthat are ill-equipped to\ndo this and to handle this\nand it starts to it's particularly\non that fourth finger,\nwhich is part of the\nmuscle we call the FDS,\na flexor digitorum that is\njust too much for it to handle.\nAnd that comes all the way down\nand meets right at the media level.\nRight on that spot that you can say\nfeels like someone's knifing\nyou right in the middle\nin that medial level.\nAnd medial epicondylitis or\nthey call it golfers elbow\nis something that a lot of\nus deal with in the gym.\nIt's one of the most common\ninflammatory conditions\npeople get from the gym\nand it all comes from this\npositioning of the dumbbell\nor barbell or hand on a\npull-up bar over time.\nSo the easiest thing to\ndo is just grip deeper\nso that what you're doing is you're using\nmore leverage from the\npalm to encapsulate the bar\nor the dumbbell or whatever\nand you're not putting that\npressure really distally\nright on that last digit\nbecause that's where that\nFDS muscle is most strained.\nSo you just almost eliminating\nthat from the equation.\nAnd it's one of those exercises that\nthe load can exceed its\ncapacity pretty quickly.\nSo that like, maybe it's only\ncapable of handling 30 pounds\nand then when you're doing a chin up\nand it goes and it drifts so far\nthat it's now you say\nyou're a 200 pound guy\nyou've got let's say 100\npounds through one arm\nand 100 pounds, this is simplified math\nthat obviously is offset by other muscles,\nbut 100 pounds to one arm\n100 pounds to the arm,\n100 pounds off of a\nmuscle that can handle 30\nis not going to take many\nrepetitions to strain it\nand you're going to feel that maybe\nby the time that a set's over\nor certainly by the time that\nworkout's over or the next day\nyou wake up and you've got\nthat notable stabbing pain.\nWhenever someone feels that\nthe best thing would be to determine,\nokay, what exercises would\nI do that were pulling\nand where the bar could\nhave drifted deeper\nor further from the meat\nof my palm into my fingers\nand figure out a way to deepen that grip.\nWhen that happens though,\nthe best thing to do\nwith most of these inflammatory conditions\nis not do any of that\nstuff for a little while.\nNot ever, just for a little while.\nThere's always things\nthat you can do around it.\nI'm not saying ever do I say,\nlike, don't go to the gym\nor don't find something you can do,\nbut I'm saying that particular exercise\nthat you feel the pain\non while you're doing it,\nnever a smart idea to do that\nexercise when it's inflamed.\nIf you are doing exercise and it hurts,\nyou probably shouldn't do the exercise\nbecause another reason\nfor the variability of exercise is\nthere's so many other\noptions that you can do\nthat will train similar\nmuscles or even the same motion\nand not cause that stress.\nSo, I mean, a cable curl would\nbe much easier to do that on\nthan let's say a chin up\nwhere you don't have the\ncontrol over the weight\nlike you do by moving a pin on a stack.\nSo I think that is a common\nthing that people find\nand the best thing to\ndo is just figure out\nhow deep you gripping in that bar.\nYou're going to find that, oh\nmy God, I didn't realize that\nbecause it was just.\nEven though you might start\na set in a good position\nand then it drifts away as you go.\n- I think that's what was happening to me\nand I'm very conscious of this now.\nAgain, for me, I haven't\nhad this elbow pain at all.\n- [Jeff] That's great.\n- Very fortunate.\nSo again, a debt of\ngratitude to your never-\nI thought there was some\nwrong in my elbow, basically.\nAnd I thought maybe it was tennis elbow\nI don't even play tennis.\nThere you go.\nOther aspects of recovery\nand variables for recovery.\nI think you and I both\nput out content about\nthe use of cold and I think\nwe can summarize it by saying,\nyeah, it does seem like\ncold water immersion\nimmediately after hypertrophy\nrestrains workouts\nmight be a problem,\nbut a cold shower is\nprobably not a problem.\nWhat about heat?\nDo you personally use\nheat and cold saunas,\nhot baths, hot compresses.\nAnd by you, I mean you\npersonally and athletes\nthat you coach or people that you coach,\nwhat are your thoughts on\nthe use of heat and or cold?\n- Well, I think it might\njust be an inherited practice\nfrom the days of trainers\nof since babe Ruth.\nBut we in baseball\nwe used a lot of cold\nfollowing performance.\nJust because the idea would be\nthere is some especially pitchers,\nthere is some inflammation\nthat is abnormal.\nThe arm is not really\ndesigned to do what they do\nespecially at the speed that they move it\nand everything else.\nSo we would use ice as a\npretty standard practice\nafter that.\nBut not a lot of heat\nand use a lot of heat\nand of course from the\nrecovery or the healing aspect\nthat actually becomes\nrather personal preference\nthey've found now after let's\nsay the first 12 to 24 hours\nwhere you're really trying\nto control inflammation\nof what might be an injury.\nBut then it can kind of\nshift the personal preference\nbecause the heat can bring\nblood to the area also\nand then the cold has its sort\nof antiinflammatory effects.\nSo like there's a balance between\nwhich one's working better for you.\nSo there's really no standard anymore\nfor heat or cold in that way.\nBut from a standpoint of like\npost-workout healthy status,\nI haven't used much heat or\ncold in terms of what we do.\nWe cover the topic of the cold showers\nand to try to dispel the myth of the,\neven people saying that there's\ngiant testosterone releases\nand you know all kinds of stuff that.\nListen, we hear all kinds of things\n'cause people want-\nI think the idea of just\nturning the water cold\nand being in it for 30 seconds\nand then all of a sudden\nmagically growing three times your size\nis intriguing for a lot of people\nand that's why they ask these\nquestions 'cause they're like,\nwell, that would be a hell of a lot easier\nthan going to the gym and training hard.\nBut like, I'm always\nfascinated by some of the stuff\nthat you talked about.\nIn fact, we started to talk\nabout some of the stuff\nin terms of cooling and what\nit can do on performance\nand that was like there's\nsome untapped territory there\nthat I think you're finding out about.\n- Yeah, what would be fun\nwould be to bring the CoolMitt\ntechnology from Stanford.\nThis is Craig Heller, my\ncolleague Craig Heller's lab\nat Stanford's done really\nimportant and amazing work\nin this area but then it\nmoved on to some other things.\nHe's also working on down syndrome\nand he works on a number of\nother really important topics\nthat scientists often do.\nBut I have access to\nthis CoolMitt technology,\nno relationship to the\ncompany, by the way,\nwould love to come out to your facility\nand we can do the blind type studies.\n- Like the blue blocker test.\n- Yeah, exactly, exactly.\nAnd see how that goes in with somebody\nas advanced trained as you\nthat's probably the best thing to do.\nSo content for the future.\nYeah, I think heat and cold\nare kind of staples in the PT world\nand it does seem like people\nuse them slightly differently\nbut they are kind of the macro\nnutrients of recovery there\nalong with sleep.\nI do have a question about\nprecision of record keeping.\nDo you keep a training journal?\nDo you recommend people\nkeep training journals?\nAre you neurotically fixed\nto cadence of movement\nand are you looking at the,\ndo you have a buzzer going off\nwhen it's 90 seconds rest.\nIs it 90 seconds rest?\nI confess I have my slow\nworkouts and my faster workouts.\nAnd they scale with whether\nor not I'm training heavier\nwith longer rest.\nOr whether or not maybe\nmidway through a workout,\nI'll shift over to doing\nhigher repetition, lower rest.\nThis is kind of my crude\nway of keeping time.\nBut I'm not-\nWill be just to kind of watch the clock.\nBut I'm not neurotically\nfixed to the buzzer\nnor am I on social media\nduring my workouts.\nWhich is actually a way\nto really improve workouts\nis to just not be on social media.\n- I can't claim that\nI'm not guilty of that.\nSometimes I am on social media\nbut sometimes I'm trying\nto post something.\n- Well, that's different,\nit's your profession.\nIt's your profession.\n- But I mean, I'm not necessarily chained\nto some sort of protocol\nin terms of how I do.\nI think by this point I've\nbeen doing this a long time\nand not only is it something\nthat I've done for a long time,\nbut it's a passion of mine,\nit's something I really enjoy.\nSo I probably inherently have\nthe ability to stick to these guidelines\nin terms of rest time\nto know what I lifted.\nEven six months ago on\na lift and how it felt\nwithout journaling it.\nBut I recognize the value\nit has to a lot of people,\nit goes back to that whole\nmy muscle connection idea\nthat we talked about in the beginning.\nLike there's a lack of awareness\nfor all aspects of training.\nAnd especially maybe it isn't\nlike your interest level.\nWe're talking you and I\nfrom a position of interest.\nLike this is what we do.\nWe enjoy just how our bodies work\nand understanding how they work.\nSome people don't care, they\njust want the end result.\nBut journaling and keeping track of that\nraises awareness to where like,\noh my God, I have been on Instagram\nfor the last seven minutes\nand I was supposed to be back\nat my next set in 90 seconds.\nLike there is a training effect of that.\nLike if you're training\nfor a metabolic overload,\nyou've blown that opportunity\nbecause you haven't,\nyour rest time very\nimportant to that protocol,\nworking as it should.\nIf you were training for strength,\nmaybe the extra few minutes\ndoesn't matter so much\nwhen you get back under\nthe bar you might find,\nyou might find that it's a\nbetter response for your body\nto rest even longer than you've been told\nthree, four minutes, five minutes.\nAnd so that way maybe it helps,\nbut I think that anything you can do\nto increase your awareness\nof your performance\nand also give yourself\nsome objective goal.\nWhenever we have an objective goal,\nit's a lot easier to actually obtain it.\nWhen you're just there to get a pump\nand you're just there to\nlift how you feel that day,\nyou have to be incredibly disciplined\nin all other aspects of your workout\nin order to make that effective.\nAnd I've done that too.\nI've actually been able\nto do that too, but again,\nthe level of repetitions I've accumulated\nover the course of my\nlife in the amount that I\nread about this stuff.\nI think I'm able to get away with that,\nbut I think more often\nthan not what I'm doing is\nnot journaling but journaling in my head\nexactly what I think\npeople should be doing\nand that is getting a specific effect\nfrom what you're trying to do.\nIt's not so haphazard.\nYou want to get a specific effect\njust like any other\nexperiment that you're doing.\nIf you're doing an\nexperiment on your own body\nwith your own weight,\nwhich to me is one of the\nmost empowering things\nsomeone can ever do.\nWhen they get bitten by the bug\nfor exercising and in training\nand I like to use the word\ntraining rather than exercise\n'cause there's a purpose behind it.\nBut when they get bitten\nby that training bug\nand they start to see\nactual changes and results,\nyou know how empowering that\nis 'cause we can't change,\nwe can't really control that\nmany things in our life,\nunfortunately.\nAnd if there's some\nthings that happen to us\nthat we really wish never happened.\nAnd those are not something\nthat we can do anything about,\nbut this is one thing that\nwe can do our best to.\nWe can't avoid disease entirely,\nwe can't predict when we're going to die,\nwe can't do those things,\nbut we can certainly decide to\nshow up into the gym that day\nand get a workout in or go\nfor a run or do something\nand in by doing that, you're\ngiving yourself I think,\na better chance at a\nhigher quality of life.\nSo anything you could do to\nincrease your awareness of it\nand keep you on track with that\nis like I'm endorsing fully.\n- Couldn't agree more,\nI could not agree more.\nThere is a topic it's\nsort of a dreaded topic,\nbut I think it's an important one\nand that's the topic of nutrition.\nAnd rather they get into\nspecific meal programs,\nwhich would take take\nhours and probably wouldn't\neven manage to scratch the\nsurface even with hours.\nWe could talk about\nprinciples around nutrition.\nWhat are sort of the themes that\nyou think people should keep in mind\nwhen thinking about how to\neat generally and pre-training\nand post-training are two\nparticularly sensitive times\nfor most, or at times that\npeople want to know a lot about.\nWhat should they eat before training\nor can they train fasted?\nWhat should they eat afterwards?\nBut just in general, what\ndo you think are some axioms\nof nutrition that really hold.\nAnd I ask this 'cause,\nnot because there's a\nlot of debate about this,\nbut because you've been\naround this space a long time\nand you've seen what\nworks for you obviously\nbut for other people too.\nWhat tends to work?\nWhat tends not to work?\nAnd how should we think about nutrition?\n- I mean, look, you've\ntouched on it a bit but like,\nnutrition can be a touchy\nsubject for people.\nAnd I understand where that comes from.\nI've talked about before that\nthere's a dogmatic tendency\nto nutrition, and there's a reason for it\nbecause it's an area\nthat people struggle with\nmore than anything else.\nAnd the reason why people\nstruggle with nutrition\nis because the commitment\nis extremely high.\nYou could start a workout program\nand actually get to the gym\nthree to five times a week.\nThat's five hours\nbased on how you and I\nwere discussing it before.\nWell, what about the other 23\nhours of each of those days.\nThere's opportunity to eat\nincorrectly or unhealthily\nevery one of those hours.\nPeople wake up in the middle\nof the night to go eat.\nLike there are things that you can do\nthat can cause amazing amounts of damage\nto your longevity in the 23 hours\nnot the 1 hour, the 23 hours.\nSo when people finally figure out a way\nto make that work for them,\nit's very passionate and I\nunderstand their passion.\nI do like I've put out, so my\napproach, my approach is like,\nI've always been sort of a\nlow sugar, lower fat guy.\nI've made the mistake of\ngoing no fat years ago\nand I paid for it.\nI was like in college and back in the day\nwe were the same age.\nWe read all the magazines\nand that was what we had.\nWe didn't have an internet then.\nSo we were reading magazines\nand the recommended\npath was to go low fat.\nIt helps you to become\nhypo caloric very easily\nbecause the density of the\ncalories in a gram of fat\nversus a gram of carbohydrates or protein\nis nine versus four for\nthe carbs and protein.\nSo if you're cutting out\ngrams of fat on a daily basis,\nyou're quickly cutting out calories\nthat allows you to get leaner.\nWell, of course as everything,\nI mean, if little is good,\nthen a lot is better.\nSo I would cut all of them\nout or almost all of them\nand at the age of 22, 21,\nI'm like standing at a stop\nup at University of Connecticut\nwaiting for the tram to\ncome and bring me to campus.\nAnd I couldn't even open my eyes\nbecause the light was blinding to me.\nIt was normal sunlight.\nIt was blinding to me,\nthe photosensitivity I had\nlearning later on after a few more courses\nthat I took there in biology\nhow necessary fat was for the\ndevelopment of healthy cells.\nI realized what was going on\nand not to mention other\nstuff skin was bad,\nhair was falling out, all kinds of stuff.\nSo I think that the\napproach to decreasing fat\nso it's not excessive,\nbecause again how\ncalorically dense it could be\nin having lower sugar.\nI'm a firm believer in\nsugar is really pretty toxic\nand something that we would\nall do better getting rid of\na lot of it.\nThat is the best approach\nfor, I believe, again,\nin my opinion, personally,\nfor the overall big picture.\nBecause though the people can\ntake exclusionary approaches\nto nutrition and taking carbs out or\neating only fats and proteins, or again,\nI'm not saying it doesn't work for you.\nAnd if it's the first thing\nthat actually allowed you\nto gain control of your nutrition\nto the point where you\nactually saw results\nand got to a healthier\nweight, then I always say,\nthen do it, then do it.\nBut just make sure it's\nsomething you can do forever\nand doesn't bring upon\nother repercussions.\nBut I think that non\nexclusionary approaches to diets\nare the most sustainable\nfor the rest of your life.\nAnd all I'm interested in\nfrom a nutrition standpoint\nis something that's sustainable.\nSo when I preach what I preach,\nI've been doing this since I was 15, 14.\nPeople say like, how's he\nget so ripped? How's he get?\nI have been doing this for four-\nFor how many years? 30 years.\n- Eating clean low sugar.\n- Yeah, 30 years.\nAnd the beginning it was\na slow shift I had to make\nwhere I was like,\nI went from the worst\ndiet in the whole world.\nEven when I was 14 years\nold, my breakfast was,\nI talked about this so\nmany times, but Entenmann's\nI would eat Entenmann's donuts and...\n- Those long rod-\n- Yeah, the long [indistinct]\n- They even took the\nhole out of the donut.\n- [Jeff] Exactly.\nWhy would you delete\nthe middle of the donut?\n- The crumb donut there.\nI would eat donuts...\n- I can taste it in my-\nI don't like sugar very much\nbut over the years I've\nlost my appetite for sugar.\nBut as you talk about the entiments\nI can literally smell\nand taste the frosting.\nAnd to me now it's disgusting\nbut back then it might\nhave been appetizing.\n- You would probably have\nlike really good information\non this, but like my ability\nto actually remember,\nthey've said smell is very\nevoking of memories, right?\n- So smell is unlike the other senses\nbecause there's a direct line literally\nfrom our sense of smell to the\nmemory centers of the brain.\nIt doesn't have to go through\nany intermediate stations.\n- Okay, so my ability to actually recall\nexact taste of all the\nstuff that I used to love\nis enough to satisfy me to not\nengage in those things now.\nAs crazy as that is.\nLike I almost get my\nfeel through remembering\n'cause of these strong senses of memory\nof what it was like,\n'cause oh, that used to taste so good.\nOkay, that's good, I had it so...\n- Fantastic.\nWe know the neuromodulator\nthere, that's dopamine.\nYour ability to get the dopamine release\nfrom the thought of some things.\nMost people when they get\nthat dopamine release,\nit causes a triggering\nof the desire for more.\n- [Jeff] for more.\n- Right, people think\nof dopamine as pleasure.\nDopamine, there's a\nbook, great book called,\n\"The Molecule of More.\"\nI didn't write the book\nunfortunately, but someone else did\nand it's a great book\nand it's really about\nhow dopamine we think it's about pleasure,\nbut it establishes craving.\nSo you're able to satisfy that\nand it is a very adaptive\nthing for you because\nyou are indeed very lean\nand that's one of your\nkind of hallmark things\nas a professional who does\nthis in the public space\nthat's important when people\nare out there talking about\ngetting lean and you look\nat them and you're like,\nmaybe you need to do the protocols.\nIt's a huge advantage\nbut yeah, I think that,\nit sounds like you've cultivated practices\naround avoiding certain things.\n- Yes.\nBut not avoiding certain\nthings that I think\nare easily avoided if\nyou realize that there,\nI think that we have enough\nscience and literature out there\nto prove that the altered\npath is a better path.\nYou know what I mean?\nLike I feel like if I was just doing it\nbecause I wanted to be lean,\nI'm not quite sure it\nwould've held for so long.\n- Well and we have a\nguest that whose episode\nhas been recorded for this podcast\nwho runs an eating disorder clinic\nat the University of Pennsylvania.\nMedical school, studies binge\neating disorders, anorexia,\nOCD and he will go on record in obesity,\nand he will go on record saying that\nthese very highly palatable\nprocessed high sugar foods\nof the sort that we're talking\nabout, donuts and so forth,\nthat they are actually dangerous, right?\nThat there are elements\nof the way that they\nengage neural circuitry.\nHe's a neurosurgeon that reshape the brain\nin dangerous ways.\nAnd those are his words and...\n- Yeah and it's not just entiments.\nI mean, I think not just entiments right?\nYeah, they're coming after\nus, with what, with donuts.\n- [Jeff] Exactly.\n- Yeah, they can't catch us.\n- [Jeff] True, true.\n- In any case.\nSo in terms of what you do eat,\nhow do you structure that in terms of,\nwhen you look down at a\nplate you've done this,\ndescribed this before,\nbut I think it's just a\nbeautifully simple description\n'cause I think a lot of\npeople don't want to do\ncalorie counting and all this and\nhow should people think about what to eat?\n- So yeah, I have like\nwhat I call a plate method\nand it's just simple\n'cause it works for me.\nAnd again, if you're struggling\nwith real eating issues,\nthese mechanisms become\nadmittedly less effective\nbecause you're having\nmaybe you have emotionally\ntriggered eating\nand you can't stop at one plate.\nI mean that you could get the plate right\nbut if the portions are out of control.\n- Plate has a dimensionality of height?\n- Or multiple plates like\nsecond and third plate.\n- Or fourth.\n- Like then all these\nthings can be challenged\nbut what I say is when you have your plate\nthen you just simply look\nat it as like a clock.\nAnd if you just make a 9:20 on the clock,\nso one arm goes over to the 9\nand one of the arms goes over to 20.\nWell, then you're basically...\nYou're going to take the\nsecond largest portion of that\n'cause you're going to make a\nline towards 12 o'clock too.\nAnd the largest portion is going to be\nyour fibers carbohydrate.\nSo that's the green vegetables, right?\nSo whether it be broccoli or\nBrussels sprouts, or asparagus,\nor pick your favorites.\nLike those are the ones\nthat give us a lot of the\nmicronutrients we need,\nthey're the ones that are generally\naccepted as more healthy\nand they're also going\nto provide the fiber\nthat's going to be both beneficial\nin terms of its impact on insulin\nand also just through\nfilling you up, right?\nAnd then I take the next\nlargest portion of that\nand I devote that towards protein.\nAnd I think it's really important\nespecially for anybody active,\nthe more active you are\nthe more you embark on\ntrying to build muscle\nyou're going to need to\nhave protein in every meal.\nSo I have that.\nAnd again, you know, here we're talking\ncleaner sources of protein.\nBut like, you'll never find\nlike boiled chicken on my plate.\nLike I ditched those days\nwhen I was 16 or 15 or 16,\nlike I realized after reading\nthose body building magazines\nthat maybe the low fat\nthing stuck for too long,\nbut the no fat thing stuck for too long,\nbut the boiled chicken\nand a steam broccoli thing\nthat ended quickly for me\n'cause I really I'm not\ngoing to eat this forever.\nSo I'll have some sort of fish or chicken\nbut it'll be cooked in a way that's like\nit's got maybe some sauce on it\nor it's got some maybe it's tomato sauce.\nAnything to just make it a\nlittle bit more palatable\nand interesting without\nblowing the value of the meal.\nAnd then that last portion\nis where I put my starchy carbohydrates.\nAnd again, that's the part\nthat some people will say\nexclude them entirely\n'cause they're not healthy\nor they don't work for you\nor they're not beneficial long term.\nFor me it's been a God sent.\nAnd I do think I'm like most people\nmy body craves those carbohydrates.\nI choose things like sweet\npotatoes which is my favorite\nor I'll have rice or I'll have pasta.\nI'm Italian so I like pasta.\nAnd like I will have those\nthings, I'm not excluding them,\nbut I don't put them in the portions\nthat you would generally find.\nMy wife and I will go out\nand we'll go to the restaurant sometimes\nbecause we travel quite a bit\nor used to at least with baseball too.\nThere's a cheesecake\nfactory everywhere you went\nand I love cheesecake factory,\nbut like the way they structure meals is\nit's all rice at the bottom,\nand a little bit of chicken on top.\nAnd I mean, it's a plateful of rice\nthat you wouldn't find\nme make a plate that way.\nI'm going to just devote\nthat portion of the plate\nto the starchy carbohydrate.\nAnd so it gives me a little\nbit more responsibility\nin terms of portion control\n'cause those are the foods,\nagain, probably dopamine driven that are\nmost easily over eaten.\nI always ask the question,\nwhat's the last time you ate\n10 chicken breasts at a meal?\nLike you're getting sick of\nit after maybe two or three,\nbut you could eat a whole hell\nof a lot of carbohydrates,\nstarchy carbohydrates\nbecause the they're just so satisfying\nand I think those triggers,\nas you said, to want more,\nlike that's what happens, right?\nYou just keep eating, even\nwhen you're feeling full,\nyou want more.\nAnd that's the biggest\ndanger to carbohydrate.\nSo if you can develop some\nsort of discipline around them,\nthen you can still enjoy them.\nIf you can't develop that\ndiscipline for whatever reason,\nthen maybe they do become something\nthat you have to work yourself around\nor adopt a different eating style.\nAnd as I said, I'm\nnever to the point where\nI'm not trying to be\ndogmatic in my approach.\nI'm always trying to\nsay, this is how I do it\nand I'm a believer in it\njust like everyone else's\nbeliever in their method,\nbut I'm open to the idea that\nsomething that works for you\nand gets you to a healthier\nweight and a sustainability,\nlike that is good, that's good for me.\nProvided doesn't introduce other issues.\n- Something one can do consistently,\nthat's something I picked\nup from you over the years.\nWhat can you do consistently?\nAnd for me, that also meant,\nwhen, and how can I eat?\nWhat can I eat consistently\nthat will also allow me\nto be alert after lunch\nso I can actually get some work done.\nOr eat, I like to train\nfasted in the morning\nbut I don't do any long term fasting.\nIt just so happens that I'm\nfine doing water and caffeine\nin the morning and training in the morning\nand then I eat my first meal afterwards.\nBut I get carbohydrates at night\nso my glycogen is restored.\nI think carbohydrates are wonderful.\nI just don't eat them in excess.\nSo to me, I feel like when\nwhat you describe as a very rational\nliterally balanced approach.\nAnd obviously there will be variations\nfor people who are dealing\nwith obesity or diabetes.\nI've got friends that are\non the pure carnivore thing,\nI have friends that are vegan\nand it's always impressive to me\nwhen somebody can stick\nto anything consistently\nexcept when they're sticking\nto just poor behavior.\n'Cause there's nothing\nimpressive about that.\nWell, I think that's very helpful\nbecause I think there's,-\nFor the typical listener of this podcast,\nthe online content that people see,\nthe battles are very confusing.\nThey're distracting.\nBecause people really think,\noh, that there's a right\nway and a wrong way\nand it sounds like the way that one can\neat consistently over time that's healthy.\nCertainly fewer processed\nand sugary foods,\nI think almost everybody agrees there.\n- Yeah, almost everyone\nagrees on that, right?\nSo I think it's calorie manipulation\nthrough some other method.\nSo even intermittent\nfasting, like you said,\nlike that could be, it's\nfor people that are grazers.\nLike if you are a grazer\nand your real problem is portion control\nover the course of the day,\nbut you can respond to a rule that says,\nno, you're eating between here and here,\nthat you can obey that rule.\nWell, you're not going to be able to graze\nduring the times that you might\nbe doing additional damage.\nSo sure there's other hormonal benefits\nthat people will talk\nabout from that approach.\nBut from a longevity standpoint\nand habit forming standpoint,\nif it's fixing the habit that\nyou're breaking too often\nby eating throughout\nwhenever you feel like you\nwalk by food, it's good\nand it works.\nAnd again, if people can, will tell you\nyou can probably eat\nwhatever you want to eat\nas long as you're eating\nwithin that window.\nBut I think the more responsible people\nwho are practitioners of that will say,\nno, you still want to\navoid processed sugar\nand things like that.\nAnd that's just a mechanism\nof eating not really a diet.\nBut like it's I think that people-\nI hate to be as like as\nbasic as it sounds with that\nbut it's for the exact reason that\nif it it's that 23 hour day\nphenomenon that it's like,\nyou said you're impressed,\nit is impressive.\nIt's so hard to control\nall of our behaviors\nand food being one of the hardest thing.\nOne of the biggest temptations for people.\nYou got to learn how to\ncontrol that for so long\nand then do it day after day after day,\nwhatever that mechanism is that\nworks for you is impressive\nand I'm a believer in it.\nI think that's how I feel.\nI just feel like the\npeople need to be able\nto be given some reigns\nto be able to find what works for them.\n- Well, I love to eat\nand one of the beauties of weight training\nis I feel like I can eat plenty for my age\nand I'm not as lean as you are,\nbut I'm happy with where I'm at.\nI could always do better.\nWith each year actually I'm getting better\nprobably because I'm eating cleaner.\nProbably 'cause I also have\nsomeone to cook for me now.\nAnd we like...\nI have that too.\n- We like healthy food\nand so I'm very fortunate.\nI don't think we have any\npackaged food in our home.\nWe even started making sauerkraut\nat home, I don't make it.\nI mean she makes it.\n- My wife actually she turned me on\nto a tip that I actually\nshared with the whole channel\nwhich was like, you can go to,\nwe have a Stew Leonard's around\nour big grocery store chain\naround us and they have\na catering department.\nAnd they're often used\nfor catering big parties\nand big tubs of grilled chicken,\nbut like really good grilled chicken.\nAgain, not the boiled chicken\nand big tubs of sweet potatoes.\nAnd we'll get a bunch of those\nand she'll go over and she'll get them\nand then she'll sort of\narrange them on plates\nand put the plates in and like,\nI'm okay with repetitive eating.\nI think more people are probably\nokay with repetitive eating\nthan they think.\nI think that when you actually break down\nhow many different breakfast\nvariations, do you have?\nThree, two.\n- Two or three maximum.\n- So like, I think when the\npeople do there's more variety\nfor dinner probably but like\neven there you probably eat\nfive different types of dinners\nover the course of a week or a month.\nWell, if you have that ability to identify\nthe things that you like, and\nagain, no plan is going to work\nif you're eating stuff you don't like.\nIt's not going to work\nforever, nothing will,\nyou have to really enjoy\nwhat you're eating.\nAs long as these variations of this meal\nare something that you really enjoy\nand there are limited versions of them,\nthe reproducibility of that is simple.\nIt will take some time but\nif you're fortunate enough\nin our case to have somebody\nwho can prepare it for you,\nnow that's even part out of the equation.\nAnd it just makes it very simple.\nBut I do think when you tally up\nall the costs of medical care\nthat are spiked by having poor nutrition\nand you then offset that\nby what it might cost you\nto invest in a faster strategy\nlike this catering trick\nor whatever it might be,\nyou'd be best off figuring out a way\nto maybe reallocate some of your money\nto preparing this because\nhow important it is\nto your long term health and longevity.\nIf you can figure out\nyour nutrition issues,\nif everyone listening to this podcast\ncan figure out their nutrition issues,\nthis whole world will be different.\nThat is like one of the\nlargest sources of disease,\nand pain and discomfort\nbecause people really\nstruggle with nutrition.\n- Yeah, and it's a huge problem.\nI mean the obesity, it is\nan epidemic in this country.\nIt's a very, very serious.\nAlso a lot of highly processed\nfoods are more expensive\nthan healthier foods when\nyou really break it down.\nEven the better sourced high quality foods\nare right there on par less\nthan the processed foods\nfor sure.\nBut couple other questions\nas it relates to training.\nBecause I think that one\nthing that a lot of people\nwonder about and maybe we could do this\nin kind of a true false method\njust to get through some of these...\n- 50/50 I'll get it right at least.\n- Exactly.\nMen and women should train differently.\n- The science of it will say false.\nAnd again, not to generalize,\nbut kind of the point you\ntouched on earlier today.\nI do find that casually\ninterested women in training\nwill migrate more towards\ncertain types of fitness,\nlike kickboxing, like dancing, like,\n- Low rest circuit type.\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nAnd I think, again,\nwhatever is that you are\ngoing to engage in regularly\nis what you should do.\nPhysiologically, no.\nAnd I think if we can get more women\nto feel more comfortable in the gym\nperforming the same\nexercises and the same,\nin receiving the same\nstrength training benefits\nand working on progressive\noverload and like,\nwe've hit the holy grail.\nBut I think that it's a big bridge\nthat has to be gapped still\nbecause there's just some reality to-\nListen, there are very, my wife\nis a perfect example of this\nliving a very complicated busy life.\nWe have two young boys they're twins\nand her attention and focus is there.\nAnd it's like, she doesn't do\nthis for a living like I do.\nAnd if she can get a decent\nworkout and she's happy,\nbut she's not necessarily\nworking on her deadlift PR.\nAnd so I think that that\nwould help her and serve her\nin the long term to work\non increasing her PRs,\nand different lifts and building\nher strength progressively.\nBut in her life right now is\nnot necessarily in the cards\nto have the time to focus on that.\nSo would you then discourage\nthis other thing that she\nmight find interesting,\nlike some boxing.\nThere was a little, I\ndon't remember the brand,\nbut like one of those\npunchable boxing standup things\nand she enjoys it.\nLike anything to get you\nmoving is going be preferable\nbut I don't think that\nnecessarily physiologically\nthere's a difference.\n- You started weight\ntraining pretty young.\n- Yeah.\nI messed around with my brother\n'cause he was older, he\nwas four years older.\nSo I was kind of messing\naround with weights probably\n12 or 13 with a 5 pound dumbbell.\n- Yeah, you hear that young\nkids shouldn't work out\nwith the weights.\nI don't know what the going standard is.\nNow they say, shuts down long\nbone growth or growth plates\nthis sort of thing.\nYou've got two young boys\nadorable kids by the way.\n- [Jeff] Thanks.\n- One of the things that is\nvery heartwarming is to see\nyou're in great shape, you're\nclearly extremely bright,\nyou know your craft, you loved your craft.\nYou work with Jesse, who\nwe'll talk about as well.\n- [Jeff] That's great.\n- Which is great.\nThere's a camaraderie there,\nhaving great teammates\nas part of a business\nor to work out with is\njust makes life better.\nLet's just be honest.\nI'm grateful to have great\nteammates for the podcast\nand my lab, of course, as well.\nBut to see your boys and your\ndogs and the whole picture,\nI'm sure it has a lot of\ncontours and complexity\nthat we don't know about\nand shouldn't know about,\nbut it's a beautiful picture.\nAnd will they weight train?\nI've seen the videos\nof one or both of them\nhanging from the bar.\n- These kids are naturals,\nI'm telling you that.\n- I wonder where they get it from.\n- I don't even encourage it.\nI'm not going to be the dad\nwho's sitting there saying,\nlet's go somewhere.\nWe got our two days.\nI'm not going to do that but\nthey have a natural interest\nin the gym.\nThey just sometimes like\nto be out with daddy.\nSo they'll come out there.\nI of the two of us, my wife\nand I will be the one who\nhas a little bit more of a longer leash\nto let them explore things\n'cause I was a dummy at times too\nand figured out best\nthrough the mistakes I made.\n- Through injury, right.\nIn neuroscience we call\nthat one trial learning.\n- There you go.\nThese guys are going to be\nmasters in one trial learning\nbecause you know, they'll\ngo grab the bars of my,\nthe handles of my jamer that's there\n'cause it's at a lower level to them\nand they're swinging around\nthey're doing pull-ups\non it naturally uncoached\nnothing from me.\nOne will walk up to a deadlift\nbar stand over it naturally\nnever saw me do it,\nstands over there and just\ngoes, he tries to pull it.\nSo there's a definitely an\ninclination to liking the gym\nand I will fully support that.\nBut of course body weight will\nbe good for quite a while.\n- Yeah, so what age do\nyou think is reasonable\nfor kids to start exploring\na non body weight training?\n- I think around 13.\nI think around 13.\nOnce puberty, I think\nit's okay to start to.\n'Cause there's so much,\nI even say for people\nthat are like later in age\nwho are just starting out,\nlearn with your own body weight first,\nthere's plenty of resistance to be had\nby learning how to command\nyour body in space.\nSo if you have never trained before,\nyou're going to get very stimulated\nby doing lunging and reverse lunging,\neven learning some of the\nappropriate reception around\nmovement through space.\nPull-ups, chin ups.\nPull-ups and chin ups are challenging\nfor even people that have had\n20, 30 years of experience\nin the gym.\nSo there's a lot of stimulus\nto be had by body weight\nand jumping straight to\ndumbbells or barbells\nis actually doing yourself a disservice.\nYou can learn better command\nof your body in space\nso that when you go back\nto the bigger lifts,\nyou're going to have an easier time\nsort of progressively loading them\nand building up that\nfoundation of strength.\nI'm not saying that you have to become\na master calisthenics athlete\nbefore you can touch a\nbarbell, that's not even true.\nI'm just saying there's so much capacity.\nKids are going to be doing this anyway.\nAnd really just, if you\nlook at general play,\nthey are jumping, they are\nlunging, they are climbing,\nthey are pulling like,\nthat's what they do.\nI don't know where the avoidance\nof like structured training\nis for younger kids.\nAgain, provided they're using body weight\nand maybe less ballistic\nmovements or something like that.\nThings that are, or certainly\noverloaded movements.\nI think we should\nencourage kids to do more.\nThere's a lot of obesity\nin kids on the rise also\nand that is incredibly\ndisconcerting to me.\nSo I think and I hope it doesn't come from\nthe advice of some that say,\nwell, wait until you're older\nto start doing something like.\nThat's a way worse trade off\nthan engaging in something smart now.\n- We used to get kicked out of\nthe house when we were kids.\n- [Jeff] Totally.\n- My mom would kick us out.\nI had a huge pack of boys\nthat lived on my street\nbut we'd get kicked outside.\nLike literal, you're not\nallowed in, no television.\nBut there were video games, of course\nbut we were kicked out the house.\nWe had to go play.\nFor us it was skateboarding, soccer\nand then we'd find our trouble.\nBut so post training nutrition.\nWe're the same age, years\nago I was sort of neurotic\nabout the idea that I had to ingest\na certain amount of\ncarbohydrates and proteins\nwithin two hours then it\nwas 90 minutes of training.\nI confess I get, if I train hard,\nso I'm talking about\nthe resistance training\nnot the running.\nBut the resistance training,\n60 to 90 minutes later,\nI'm really hungry.\nBut there have been days when I just skip\nand then the hunger passes\nand then later I eat more.\nI might eat twice as much later\nthat's just the way\nsometimes schedules go.\nBut what are your thoughts in terms of\nthe nutrition science, the\ntraining related effects\nof the post-training meal?\nIs it something that you try to get?\nIs it something you think\npeople should pay attention to?\n- So that science has\nactually probably been\nthe one that's changed the\nmost in my lifetime, honestly,\nbecause, again, we're at the same age\nand I was falling for the same trap\nwhere I would really be focused on like,\nI'm risking speeding tickets\ndriving home from the gym\nto make you sure I got an anabolic window.\nLike I did all that, I really did.\nBut thankfully that's been\nsort of debunked in your body\nisn't just rushing through\nthese certain periods of time\nto utilize the nutrients in our body,\nbut are able to partition\nthem and use them over a long,\nmuch greater duration.\nUp to now, they're saying,\nthree to four hours after training,\nfive hours after training,\nyou could still see the\nbenefits of replenishment.\nA lot of that is just\nI think there's a\nconsistency element to it\nthat just utilizing a post workout window\nor a post workout meal,\neven if it's within two hours or one hour\nis just integrating the habit of saying,\nlisten, I just did this activity\nand now want to replenish\nsome of what I lost the energy\nthat I used to perform\nthe exercises that I did.\nAnd just getting into\nthe routine knowing that\nthe engine is ultimately\nfed by what we put in it.\nAnd the concept of\nreplenishing the fuel lost\nis still a concept that I think again,\ndifferent in mechanism but still important\nin terms of fueling the\noverall performance.\nSo the pre-workout period of time\ngives us a chance to\nactually have a longer window\nbecause if those nutrients\nare obtained pre-workout,\nit's not like they're gone in\nthat hour that you've trained,\nthey're still there and\navailable for your body to use.\nSo I think it's important\nto get one of the two right\nor at least make sure you're consistently\nhaving one or the two\nor you might risk going\nthrough all these periods\nof having no nutrition\nto support your efforts.\nNot only will your\nworkouts potentially suffer\nin terms of the output,\nbut then you're also\nnot providing your body\nany ability to capitalize\non an opportunity to feed it\nand refuel and recover.\nSo I'm not very dogmatic\nabout what specifically to eat\npre or post workout.\nBut I do think you should have protein\nsurrounding your training,\nwhether that be ahead of time or after.\nProtein could be a\nlittle bit hard to digest\nfor some people.\nSo if you do that pre-workout\nand then you're finding\nyour workout is slogging\nbecause you don't feel good\nthen suddenly you put\nthat after your meal.\nBut this whole concept\nof the urgency of time\nhas thankfully been removed\nand we can just learn to eat\na little bit more responsibly\nand drive more responsibly so we're not\ntrying to rush home from the gym\nand risk killing people on the way.\nBut I think it's great\nbecause I think that\nthat was something that it just showcases\na belief that people had for so long\nthat has since been proven\nto be not that important.\nAnd there's a tip of the cap\ntowards research in a good way\nwhere it's like, all right,\nI think we could all agree\nthat this isn't necessarily\ntrue anymore.\nAnd look at yourself and say,\noh my God, I did that so often.\nI bit that one hook line\nand sinker but then realize,\nokay, we could always make a change.\nAnd the good thing about nutrition is\nthose changes can happen the\nvery next time you go to eat\nand you'll start to see\nthe benefits of that.\nSo I'm not a big believer\nin that strict approach\nto pre or post-workout.\nI mean, even as far as\npre-workout supplements,\na lot of people don't take them.\nA lot of people don't like\nthem, they don't take them,\nthey don't like, they're not\nnecessarily even being used\nas the new nutritive\nside of the pre-workout.\nThey're just more used\nto fuel the workout.\n- For me it's water and\nsome form of caffeine.\n- Yeah.\nI mean, it is whatever,\nagain, I think it's important.\nI do think it's important to maintain\na high level of output.\nSo if your pre-work attrition requires\na stimulant in order to help you do that\nor if your pre-work nutrition\nis causing you to have\na harder time to train\nbecause you're feeling full or stomachache\nor something else, then\nthat that's not achieving\nwhat you're trying to do.\nThe ultimate goal is to\nstill be able to perform\nat the highest level.\nSo whatever your nutrition is required\nto allow you to still do that,\nthat is probably the most\nimportant factor of all of it.\n- Great, I love the very\nclear and rational approach.\nDon't ingest anything\nright before your workout\nor near your workout\nthat's going to make your workout worse.\nYeah, and it's so simple\nand yet you don't hear this\nbecause I think people will think,\noh, they must have a pre-workout\nthey must have a post-workout.\n- No, again, even if the\nbenefits that are to be had\nfrom whatever's being suggested\nis going to be easily\noffset by the fact that\nyou can't perform at an output capable\nof driving any change.\nSo that would pretty\nmuch negate the fact that\nyou're not outweighing those benefits\nof whatever nutritive approach you took\nand is struggling through your workout.\n- For me, the best pre-workout\nis a good night's sleep,\nhydration, caffeine, and music.\n- Yeah, there you go.\nI mean, that's a simple formula.\n- It works.\nAnd then post what I do I\ndo find I get quite hungry\nand want to eat quite a bit more and...\n- Well, that's a natural\nresponse the body's going to\nand most people want to do that\nand I think it should be fed.\nI work out as you know,\nagain, a lot of my postings\non Instagram will happen\nat 10 o'clock at night,\n10:30 at night, 11 at night,\n'cause I am actually training there\nand that's where I'm\ntaking those little breaks\nin between sets to actually\nfilm or post something.\nBut like, I then go inside and eat dinner.\nSo I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night.\nIt's not necessarily ideal,\nI'm not recommending that\nas a tool for anybody.\nI think it dispels one thing,\nI've never been a believer\nin Kenny carbs after six.\n- That makes no sense to me.\n- [Jeff] Zero sense.\n- Based on all the new,\nall the signs of metabolism\nthat I've seen makes no sense.\nI think as long as you\ncan, sort of like napping.\nI talked to Matt Walker, one\nof the great sleep researchers\nwrote why we sleep, et cetera,\nand has his own podcast about\nsleep, tremendous researcher,\npublic communicator\nabout sleep and he said,\nnaps are fine provided\nthey don't interrupt\nyour ability to sleep well at night.\nSimple.\nSome people can sleep\nfrom eight to 9:00 PM\nand then go to bed at\nmidnight and not a problem.\nOther people they take a\n30 minute nap after lunch\nand they can't sleep at night.\nSame thing with-\nCaffeine's a little different\nbecause Matt would argue\nthe architecture of sleep\ncan be disrupted, et cetera.\nBut if you can eat dinner late\nand eat carbohydrates late,\nI actually need carbohydrates at night\nin order to be able to sleep.\nWhenever I've done a low\ncarbohydrate type regimen\nin the evening, I have a\nhard time falling asleep.\nI'm just too alert.\nAnd so I eat carbohydrates in the evening\nto restore glycogen\nbut also in order to make\nsure that I can fall asleep.\n- I actually can,\nagain obviously it's\nalready late at night,\nby the time I'm done eating,\nbut like I can fall asleep\nwithin 5, 10 minutes\nof finishing my meal.\nBecause I do think that they\nhave that same effect on me,\nbut I'm never,\nI'm not bothered by the\nfeeling of fullness.\nI'm not unable to sleep because\nof a feeling of fullness.\nBut I do like the fact that\nI feel as if I'm at least replenishing\nwhat was lost through my hard training.\nAnd I do like to back it up with a dinner.\nI don't need to eat smaller amounts.\nSome people can't have that much.\nI will say after a hard leg workout,\nI don't have the same appetite\nthat I do after let's say,\nan upper body workout.\nIt can really disrupt my\nwhole feeling of wellbeing.\n- You want to eat less\nafter you train your legs?\n- [Jeff] I do, yeah.\n- Oh, wow, I'm the opposite.\n- No, 'cause I could\nfeel sick to my stomach.\n- You're clearly training harder.\nI've seen the way you train,\nyou do train very intensely.\n- Yeah.\nI think it's important.\nI mean, I think that...\nAgain, it's that trade off between,\nif you're not going to train\nfor a long period of time\nthen you're going to want to train harder.\nAnd again, I actually\nfeel like contrary to\nwhat people might think as you age,\nyou're better off training harder\nfor a shorter period of time.\nIt's always within the\nrealm of safe training.\nI mean, I think that's\nwhat I like to think\nthat's what I bring to the table.\nLike an approach that's\nsmarter so I can train harder.\nLike not doing the dumb\nthings I did when I was a kid.\nAnd with that trade off\nbeing a harder trainer,\nI think I get the results that I want\nbecause I'm able to really\npush it and then back off\nand again, the meal feels like\nalmost a physiological reward\nfor the hard effort I put in the gym\nknowing that I'm also replenishing\nand setting the stage for\nthe next day to be another\nsuccessful day of training\nor maybe not depending upon\nhow many times a day a week\nI train.\nI think that it's,\nIt's a lot less,\nI hate to say but it's\na lot less scientific\nthan we want to make it.\nAnd as it seems to be\ncoming back oftentimes\nlike the thing that works for you\nis really the most important thing\nbecause ultimately\ngetting your ass in there\nand doing what you do\nis really the thing that\nprovides the best benefit.\n- Absolutely, and there are\nmany things that I would say\nare hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere,\nbut one of them is certainly consistency.\nYou make it happen one way or another.\n- Huge. I mean, consistency\nreally is the determinant.\nAnd I know that that is\nthe hardest part for people\nthat are, and why people tend\nto look for the shortcut,\n'cause consistency is\nthe part that becomes\nthe biggest challenge.\nBut if you could find,\nlisten, if you could find the,\nyou know through what I've\nbeen trying to encourage here\nis like if you could find\nthe nutrition approach,\nif you could find the training approach,\nif you could try find the training split,\nif you could try all those\nthings that encourage you\nto want to go to the gym.\nLike you're locked in at\nthe point where you said\nyou actually look forward to\ngoing and doing your workout.\n- I love it.\nI look forward to, I mean, it's-\nActually this morning,\none of our teammates for the\npodcast and I got to workout\nand halfway through I just\nturned him and I said,\nI'll never figure out\nwhy that feels so good,\nbut it feels so good.\nI just, I really enjoy it and it lets,\nand I love to eat and it lets me eat right\nand I love the way it\nmakes me feel afterward.\nI don't understand this concept\nof not enjoying the gym.\nCardio's a little different,\nI always loathe the first\n10 or 20 minutes of a jog.\nI mildly loathe the middle\nthird and by the end,\nI think this is the greatest thing ever,\nwhy don't want to do it all the time.\nAnd then that feeling evaporates\nbefore the next time I do it.\n- Yeah, of course I don't\neven remember it either,\nafter we get on, then do it again.\n- [Andrew] Exactly.\n- I think if people could,\nif we had one gift we\ncould give to everybody\nit would be the love of fitness.\nIf they could be bestowed\nthe love of fitness\nit would change the entire world.\nBut I think when you hear\nthings like this, that like,\nhey, that will work and that will work too\nand that this will work too.\nRather than the dogmatic\none way only approach,\nwhich could become\ndiscouraging for people.\nThen I think it becomes a\nlittle bit uplifting like,\nwell, I've never tried that.\nI've actually never\ntried a total body split\nor I've never tried that style of eating.\nLike it becomes encouraging\nthat you might want to explore\nand then you might finally\nget locked in and say,\nI really like this and then\nyou're off and running.\n- Some of what I so\nenjoy about your content.\nWe would be remiss if we\ndidn't briefly discuss Jesse.\nOne of the great pleasures\nfor me in watching her content\nand learning from it over the\nyears is that you took on a,\nyou decided to mentor somebody, Jesse.\nAnd there's some poking fun\nback and forth between the two\nof you which is very amusing.\nBut I have to say it\ninspired me to do something\nearly on in developing this podcast\nas I have a young intern who has helped me\nwith some of the research\nand he's a buddy,\nhe's interested in science,\nhe's about to go off to college,\nbut he also got really into fitness.\nSo we would watch the videos of you guys.\nHe was helping me get the\nInstagram content out early on.\nAnd one thing that was just,\nit's such a pleasure to be\nable to pass along knowledge\nand of course I'm learning from him.\nThis is always the way it works.\nWe learn from teaching and\nwe learn from students.\nBut it's been great to see\nJesse's progress, it's amazing.\nI've gotten to meet him in person just now\nand he has grown, he's changed physically.\nAnd I think that you\nmentioned a love of fitness.\nI think that one of the\nbest ways to be consistent\nis to take on the responsibility\nof teaching others.\nOnce one has proficiency in something.\nSo maybe you just tell\nus a little bit about\nhow that's going.\nHow is Jesse doing and\nwhere does he need a little\nmore work, where is he thriving?\nI'm impressed by the progress.\n- Well we have a, I mean,\nphysically, we can\nobviously see the changes,\nthe list of things to\nwork on or is immense\nit's so long for him\nto continue to improve.\nBut no actually, in reality, Jesse,\nthe story of Jesse was that\nI knew Jesse prior to\nstarting even Athlean-X.\nAnd a matter of fact,\nI think the funny thing\nis the very first video that\nwas ever posted on my channel\nwas a video that he shot as I don't know,\na 13 year old or something.\nAnd I said, can you just\nfilm this for a second.\nI was over there training\nmembers of the family.\nSo he then off went off to\ncollege, went into film,\nrealized he had much greener\npastures at Athlean-X\ninstead of becoming the next\n[indistinct] or something\nand he decided to come work with me.\nAnd the expectations in the beginning\nwere just to edit videos\nor just to help with various aspects of\nlike my day to day that\nI don't think I was\nequipped to really handle and\ngrow the business anymore.\nSo then look at by virtue of\nbeing in that environment,\nthere's an interest.\nI think if I worked in a gym,\nI might become interested in working out.\nAnd though that mine\nwas not a commercial gym\nit's sitting right\nbehind my office window,\nthere became an interest\nin wanting to work out a little bit.\nAnd it wasn't even an\nintentional experiment\nto put Jesse there.\nI just thought that he's\na very likable person.\nHe has a very funny personality\nand he's also the, every man.\nIn some ways as I'm sure\nmaybe you experience sometimes\nlike I'm the guy that this\ncomes naturally for me\nis what people will say.\nLike, this is what you do for a living.\nLike this is what you-\nLike there's an element of disconnect\nin terms of the relatability\nbecause I do do this for a living.\nI can't deny that I do work\nwith professional athletes.\nSo like there's a level\nof interest in this\nabove and beyond.\nBut for him, he's just the\nkid who wants to train.\nMaybe if he rolls out\nof bed before 11:00 AM\nand doesn't have a date on Friday night,\nbut that's the guy\neverybody could relate to.\nAnd watching him transform\nand I love the fact that\neven the interest level\nwas up and down.\nLike it wasn't consistent\nfor him because he was like,\npart interested\nand then maybe not\ninterested for three months\nand then interested or not.\nAnd I never pushed it on him.\nThis is again, this was no\norchestrated experiment for me.\nIt was just like, if you want\nto do this, then do this.\nAnd also from a standpoint\nof like lending my help\nor expertise to him,\nlike I said, with my son,\nI'm not going to force it on anybody,\nI don't want to do that to anybody.\nI don't think that that's ever\ngoing to spark that desire\nfor long term adoption.\nSo he got more interested,\nhe started to learn more about it,\nhe watched just the\nvideos that we're filming.\nHe films the videos that we're filming\nand he's learning through what I'm saying\nhe's becoming more of\na student of the field.\nAnd I have to say his knowledge\nin the field has grown\nwith the growth of his physique.\nAnd he's put into practice\nsome of the things that I say,\nhe's put in practice some\nthings he hears other places\nand he winds up improving as he goes\nand he winds up starting to love this\nlike he never thought he would.\nBut it's great to see anybody grow\nand whether that be physically\nor that be emotionally\nor whether that be just in their career,\nit's great to see somebody grow.\nAnd I like to tease him.\nFunny admission here,\nthere are times when the\njabs that I will throw at him\nare something that we\nmight know ahead of time\nof what I'm going to say to him.\nPeople will say you're so mean to him.\nI can't believe it\nyou're that's so abusive.\nLike, dude, honestly, we\nlaugh after it's over.\nIt's good, we're good.\nSo of course, but like...\n- He's tougher than he\nlooks is what you're saying.\n- [Jeff] He's tougher\nthan he looks, believe me.\n- And he looks tough,\nhe's got the big beard.\n- He looks more manly than I do.\nI can't grow a beard, I don't,\nI mean, believe me, he's totally alpha\nand I'm like quickly becoming\nthe second star of this show,\nbut like he's definitely contributed\nand people enjoy his presence for sure.\n- Yeah, I certainly do.\nAnd I think that as you pointed out,\nhe's a kind of a proxy and\na template for everybody.\nWe can relate to him because\neven though I've trained for many years,\nit's been a struggle through\ngraduate school, post,\nmade it happen one way or another,\nbut with more or less attention\nand admittedly through waxing\nwaning levels of motivation\nalthough I'm fortunate that I do enjoy it.\n- What I think is nice\nabout it too is that\nit's a realistic expectation that we set.\n'Cause you're showcasing\nwhat the journey actually looks like.\nAnd he's been on the journey\nfor again devotedly for\nlet's say the last year and a half\nbut on the journey for five years.\nIf I could make the gains that he did\nstarting when I started\ntraining at 14, 15,\nand you're saying, hey, by 20,\nyou're going to have the\nstrength levels he does,\nthe physique that he does, the\nknowledge that you've gained.\nLike that seems like a blink of an eye\nnow looking back.\nAt 46 years old, I'm like, holy cow.\nLike I think it took me\n20 years, 15, 20 years\nto just even start to get into a groove.\nFor him to do in a period of five years,\nit doesn't seem long\nwhereas there's people that\nwill criticize his journey like,\noh, it's just taking so long and so like\nthere's such an instant\ngratification that people seek,\nluckily that's the minority.\nMost people are like, this is amazing,\nbut I think that it becomes\nvery uplifting because\nnot only is it relatable\nbut the journey is real\nand people can appreciate that.\nLike, this is what will happen\nif you actually put in\nconsistent hard work\nand you'll watch him transform\nand go back and watch the\nvideos like you look at.\nWe like to oftentimes throw\nback to videos where he appeared\nas smaller Jesse but also shy Jesse.\nArms crossed, head down,\nnot making eye contact with the camera\nto where now he's got\nhis own skits and intros.\nIt's like it's funny\nbecause the confidence\nwith the growth of physique\ncame confidence too,\nwhich is great.\n- Absolutely.\nPretty soon it'll be his world\nand we'll all be living in it\nas they say.\nWell, on behalf of myself\nand all the listeners,\nI really want to thank you.\nFirst of all, for the discussion today,\nI learned an immense amount\neven though I thought I\nknew your content well,\nI still learned an immense amount,\nmany things we could deploy\nfrom when to stretch,\nhow to stretch, the skipping rope.\nWe talked about nutrition,\nwe talked about heat cold\ntraining regimens.\nAnd what I love about all of this\nnow that you've given us is that\nthere's a backbone of logic\nand some consistent themes\nindeed about consistency.\nBut the logical backbone, I think is what\nwill enable people to\nreally show up to the table\nand stay there for training\nconsistently over time.\nAnd as you said, the gift of\nfitness is an immense gift.\nI can't thank you enough.\nI know you're an incredibly\nbusy human being with kids\nand dogs and a marriage and...\n- It's my pleasure.\nI'm happy I was able to make it work\n'cause I really I've been\nwatching your stuff for a while.\nAnd I really love the science of it,\nI like the way you think.\nAnd it's just, I'm just really fortunate\nthat I was able to do it.\n- Oh well, I feel very\ngratified in hearing that\nand honored to have you here.\nSo thank you so much.\n- Thank you.\n-
