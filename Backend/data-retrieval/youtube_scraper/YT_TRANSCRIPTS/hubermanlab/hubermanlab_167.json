    "transcript": "- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat guitar music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are talking about\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nor OCD.\nWe are also going to talk\nabout obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder which,\nas you will soon learn, is distinct\nfrom obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn fact, many people that\nrefer to themselves or others\nas obsessive or compulsive\nor quote-unquote,\nhaving OCD or OCD about\nthis or OCD about that\ndo not have clinically diagnosable OCD,\nrather, many people have\nobsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nHowever, there are many\npeople in the world\nthat have actual OCD,\nand for those people,\nthere's a tremendous amount of suffering.\nIn fact, OCD turns out to be number seven\non the list of most\ndebilitating illnesses,\nnot just psychiatric\nillnesses, but of all illnesses\nwhich is remarkable and\nsomewhat frightening.\nThe good news is thanks to\nthe fields of psychiatry,\npsychology, and science in general,\nthere are now excellent\ntreatments for OCD.\nWe're going to talk about\nthose treatments today.\nThose treatments range\nfrom behavioral therapies,\nto drug therapies, and brain stimulation,\nand even some of the more\nholistic or natural therapies.\nAs you'll soon learn, for certain people,\nthey may want to focus more\non the behavioral therapies,\nwhereas for others, more\non the drug-based therapies\nand so on and so forth.\nOne extremely interesting\nand important thing\nI learned from this episode\nis that the particular\nsequence that behavioral\nand/or drug and/or holistic\ntherapies are applied\nis extremely important.\nIn fact, the outcomes of studies\noften depend on whether not people start\non drug treatment and then follow\nwith cognitive behavioral\ntreatment or vice versa.\nWe're going to go into all those details\nand how they relate to\ndifferent types of OCD,\nbecause it turns out there are indeed\ndifferent types of\nobsessions and compulsions,\nand the age of onset for\nOCD, and so on and so forth.\nWhat I can assure you is\nby the end of this episode,\nyou'll have a much greater understanding\nof what OCD is and what it isn't\nand what obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder is\nand what it is not.\nAnd you'll have a rich array\nof different therapy options\nto explore in yourself or in others\nthat are suffering from OCD.\nAnd if neither you or others that you know\nsuffer from OCD or obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nthe information covered\nin today's episode will\nalso provide insight\ninto how the brain and nervous system\ntranslate thought into action generally.\nAnd also, you're going to learn a lot\nabout goal-directed behavior generally.\nMy hope is that by the end of the episode\nyou'll both understand a\nlot about this disease state\nthat we call OCD, you will\nhave access to information\nthat will allow you to\ndirect treatments to yourself\nor others in better ways,\nand that you will gain greater insight\ninto how you function and\nhow human beings function\nin general.\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis proud to announce\nthat we've partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nWe've done that for several reasons.\nFirst of all, the quality\nof their supplements\nis exceedingly high.\nSecond of all, we wanted\nto have a location\nwhere you could find all of\nthe supplements discussed\non The Huberman Lab Podcast\nin one easy-defined place.\nYou can now find that place\nat livemomentous.com/huberman.\nIn addition, Momentous\nSupplements ship internationally,\nsomething that a lot of\nother supplement companies\nsimply do not do.\nSo that's terrific whether\nor not you live in the US\nor you live abroad.\nRight now, not all of the supplements\nthat we'd discuss on The\nHuberman Lab Podcast are listed,\nbut that catalog of supplements\nis being expanded very rapidly\nand a good number of them\nthat we've talked about,\nsome of the more prominent\nones for sleep and focus\nand other aspects of\nmental and physical health\nare already there.\nAgain, you can find them at\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an\nall-in-one vitamin-mineral\nprobiotic drink that also has adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012\nand I've taken it every day since\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day is that it covers\nall of my foundational nutritional needs.\nIn fact, when people ask me,\n\"what's the one supplement I should take?\"\nI always say Athletic Greens\nbecause by taking Athletic Greens,\nyou give support to your immune system,\nto your endocrine system,\nto your nervous system\nand to the so-called gut-brain axis\nand the gut microbiome.\nAs many of you've probably heard,\nour gut, meaning everywhere from our mouth\ndown all the way through our intestine,\nis populated by trillions\nof little microbacteria\nthat support the different\nsystems of our body.\nAthletic Greens has the\nprobiotics that support\nthe microbiome, and in\nturn, support things\nlike mood, endocrine function,\nimmune system, and so on.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim their special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nMany people are deficient in vitamin D3\nand in general, vitamin D3 and K2\nsupport a huge number of factors\nin your brain and body\nthat support your immediate\nand long-term health.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim their special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics,\nand frankly, I'm not a big fan\nof the word nootropics.\nI've said that on various podcasts\nand on social media posts\nand the reason I'm not a\nfan of the word nootropics\nis it means smart drugs.\nBut as a neuroscientist,\nI know that we don't have\ncircuits in the brain\nor chemicals in the brain for being smart,\nwe have circuits in the brain for focus\nand for task switching and for creativity,\nand oftentimes those circuits\ndiffer from one another\nalthough they collaborate to create things\nthat we think of as intelligence\nor focus or creativity, et cetera.\nThesis understands this\nand for that reason,\nhas developed custom nootropics\nthat match your particular goals\nand to your particular biology.\nThey give you the opportunity to try\nseveral different blends\nover the course of a month\nand discover which ones work best for you\nand which ones don't.\nIn addition to that personalization,\nthey take it a step further\nby offering free consultations\nwith a coach to help you\noptimize your experience\nand dial in your perfect formulas.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor about eight months now\nand I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nare the best that I've ever used.\nMy go-to formula is the Clarity Formula\nor the Motivation Formula\nwhen I'm going to work or work out,\nmeaning when I'm going to\ndo focus cognitive work,\nor I'm going to exercise.\nI also like their Energy\nFormula prior to exercise.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropics starter kit,\ngo online to takethesis.com/huberman.\nYou can take a three minute\nquiz that will help match you\nto the best custom\nnootropics to start with.\nAnd Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in that first month.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman\nat checkout to get 10% off\nyour first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nthat have cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've talked many times on this podcast\nand another podcast and on social media\nabout the critical relationship\nbetween temperature and sleep.\nGenerally speaking, your\nbody temperature has to drop\nby about one to three\ndegrees in order to get\ninto and to stay in deep sleep.\nAnd waking up has a lot to do\nwith an increase in body temperature\nof about one to three degrees.\nSo for many people like\nmyself who run warm\nduring the night, I find myself waking up\nin the middle of the night.\nHowever, recently I started using\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover\nand by programming in\nthe specific temperatures\nthat work for me across the night,\nI'm staying asleep through the whole night\nand as a consequence, I'm feeling\nfar better during the day,\nmuch more focus, alertness, et cetera,\nall the great things that come\nfrom getting excellent sleep consistently.\nThe Pro Pod Cover by Eight Sleep\nis their most advanced\nsolution on the market\nfor thermal regulation during sleep,\nthat's the one I use.\nIt pairs dynamic cooling and heating\nwith biometric tracking.\nIt also has this really nice feature where\nyour mattress basically\nvibrates a little bit\nright upon waking, I like that as well.\nYou can cover any mattress with it.\nYou can start sleeping as\ncool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit,\nor as warm as 110 degrees Fahrenheit,\nAnd that range is available to you\nsimply because Eight Sleep understands\nthat people have a tremendous range\nin natural body temperatures\nand sleeping environments.\nIf you want to try Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com/huberman\nand check out their Pro Pod Cover\nand save $150 at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nwithin the USA, Canada,\nand in the United Kingdom.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman\nto save $150 at checkout.\nLet's talk about OCD or\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nFirst of all, as the name suggests,\nOCD includes thoughts or obsessions\nand compulsions which are actions.\nThe obsessions and the\ncompulsions are often linked.\nIn fact, most of the time,\nthe obsessions and the\ncompulsions are linked\nsuch that the compulsion, the behavior,\nis designed to relieve the obsession.\nHowever, one of the hallmark themes\nof obsessive-compulsive disorder\nis that the obsessions are intrusive.\nPeople don't want to have them.\nThey don't enjoy having them.\nThey just seem to pop into people's minds\nand they seem to pop into\ntheir mind recurrently.\nAnd the compulsions, unlike\nother sorts of behaviors,\nprovide brief relief to the obsession,\nbut then very quickly reinforce\nor strengthen the obsession.\nThis is a very key theme to realize\nabout obsessive-compulsive disorder\nso I'm just going to repeat it again.\nThese two features, first,\nthe fact that the obsessions\nare intrusive and recurrent,\nas well as the fact that the\ncompulsions, the behaviors,\nprovide, if anything, only\nbrief relief for the obsessions,\nbut in most cases simply serve to make\nthe obsessions stronger\nare the hallmark features\nof obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nAnd it turns out to be very important\nto keep these in mind as we go forward,\nnot just because they define\nobsessive-compulsive disorder,\nbut they also define\nthe sorts of treatments\nthat will and will not work\nfor obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nAnd then once you understand a little bit\nabout the neural circuitry underlying\nobsessive-compulsive disorder,\nwhich we'll talk about in a few moments,\nthen you will clearly understand\nwhy being a quote-unquote,\nobsessive person\nor having obsessive-compulsive personality\nis not the same as OCD.\nIn fact, we can leap ahead a little bit\nand compare and contrast OCD\nwith obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\nalong one very particular set of features.\nAgain, I'll go into this\nin more detail later,\nbut it's fair to say\nthat OCD is characterized\nby these recurrent and\nintrusive obsessions.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nthe fact that those obsessions\nget stronger as a function of people\nperforming certain behaviors.\nSo unlike an itch that you feel,\nand then you scratch\nit and it feels better,\nOCD is more like an itch that\nyou feel, you scratch it,\nand the itch intensifies.\nThat contour or that pattern of behaviors\nand thoughts interacting is very different\nthan obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nwhich mainly involves a sense\nof delayed gratification\nthat people want and somewhat enjoy\nbecause it allows them to function better\nor more in line with how they would like\nto show up in the world.\nSo again, OCD has mainly\nto do with obsessions\nthat are intrusive and recurrent,\nwhereas obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\ndoes not have that\nintrusive feature to it.\nPeople do not mind, or in fact,\noften invite or like the\nparticular patterns of thought\nthat lead them to be compulsive\nalong certain dimensions.\nSo leaving aside obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder for the moment,\nlet's focus a bit more on OCD and define\nhow it tends to show up in the world.\nFirst of all, OCD is extremely common.\nIn fact, current estimates\nare that anywhere\nfrom 2.5% to as high as 3\nor even 4% of people suffer from true OCD,\nthat is an astonishingly high number.\nNow, the reason the range is so big,\n2.5% all the way up to\n3, or maybe even 4%,\nis that a lot of the features of OCD\ngo unnoticed both in\nthe clinician's office\nand simply because people don't report it\nand don't talk about it.\nIn fact, it is possible to have recurrent\nand intrusive obsessions and not engage\nin the sorts of behaviors\nthat would ever allow\npeople to notice that somebody has OCD.\nThat can be because some\nof the intrusive thoughts\ndon't actually lead to overt behaviors\nlike hand washing or checking\nthat other people would notice.\nIt can also be because people learn\nto disguise or hide their obsessions\nand their compulsions out of shame\nor fear of looking strange\nor whatever it might be\nsuch that they have these obsessive\nand intrusive thoughts, and\nthey do little micro-behaviors\nlike they might tap their\nfingers on their thigh\nas a way to avoid, at\nleast in their own mind,\nsomething catastrophic happening.\nThat might seem crazy to you,\nit might seem bizarre, but\nthis is the sort of thing\nthat operates in a lot of people.\nAnd I really want to emphasize this\nbecause the clinical\nliterature that are out there\nreally point to the fact\nthat many people have OCD,\nfull blown OCD, and never report it\nbecause of the kind of shame and hiding\nassociated with it.\nAnother thing to point out is that OCD\nis extremely debilitating.\nI mentioned this a few minutes ago,\nbut OCD is currently\nlisted as number seven\nin terms of the most\ndebilitating illnesses,\nnot just mental illnesses or disorders,\nbut all types of illnesses\nincluding things like asthma\nand cancer, et cetera.\nSo you can imagine with that\nstanding at number seven,\nthat it is both extremely common\nand extremely debilitating.\nAnd as a consequence, it's now realized\nthat many hours, days,\nweeks, months, or even years\nof work performance or showing up at work\nof relational interactions really suffer\nas a consequence of people having OCD.\nSo this is a vital problem\nthat the scientific\nand psychiatric and psychological\ncommunities understand.\nAnd it's one of the reasons\nthat I'm doing this podcast.\nAnd of course, I received\na ton of interest in OCD\nbecause of this incredibly\nhigh incidence of OCD\nand how debilitating it is.\nWe could go really deep into\nwhy it's so debilitating.\nI don't want to spend\ntoo much time on that\nbecause I think most of\nthat is pretty obvious,\nbut some of it is not.\nFor instance, one of the\nthings that makes OCD\nso debilitating is, of course,\nthe shame that we talked about before.\nBut it's also the fact that\nwhen people are focusing\non their obsessions and their compulsions,\nthey're not able to focus on other things.\nThat's simply the way\nthat the brain works.\nWe're not able to focus on\ntoo many things at once.\nThe other thing is that\nOCD takes a lot of time\nout of people's lives.\nWith recurrent intrusive\nthoughts happening\nat very high frequency, or\neven at moderate frequency,\npeople are spending a lot of\ntime thinking about this stuff\nand they're thinking about the behaviors\nthey need to engage in, and\nthen engaging in the behaviors,\nwhich as I mentioned before,\njust serve to strengthen the compulsions\nand so they're not actually\ndoing the other things\nthat make us functional human beings\nlike commuting to work or doing homework\nor doing work or listening\nwhen people are talking\nor interacting or sports or working out,\nall the things that make\nfor a rich quality life\nare taken over by OCD in many cases.\nSo while that might be obvious to some,\nI'm not sure that it's\nobvious to everybody\njust how much time OCD can occupy.\nAnother thing you'll\nsoon learn is that sadly,\na lot of the obsessions\nand compulsions in OCD\noften relate to taboo topics.\nAnd that's because the\ngeneral categories of OCD\nfall into three different bins,\nchecking obsessions and compulsions,\nrepetition obsessions and compulsions,\nand order obsessions and compulsions.\nThe checking ones are somewhat obvious,\nchecking the stove or checking the locks,\nwhich I think we all tend to do.\nI'm somebody typically\nI'll head off to the car\nto commute to work and I'll think,\ndid I lock the front door,\nand I'll go back once,\nbut I won't go back twice or 50 times.\nPeople with OCD will often\ngo back 20 or 30 times\nbefore they'll actually allow\nthemselves to drive off.\nAnd then it's a real challenge for them\nto continue to drive off\nand discard with the idea\nthat they didn't check the stove\nor they didn't check the locks\nor they didn't check\nsomething else critical.\nRepetition obsessions and compulsions,\nobviously can dovetail\nwith the the checking ones,\nbut those tend to be\nthings like counting off\nof a certain number of numbers,\nlike one, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven,\nseven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\nPeople perform that repeatedly,\nrepeatedly, repeatedly,\nor feel that they have to.\nI remember years ago\nwatching a documentary about\nthe band, The Ramones, right?\nMost people heard of The Ramones, right?\nJeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses,\neveryone had to change\ntheir last name to Ramone.\nThey weren't actually all related\nto one another, by the way.\nYou had to change your\nlast name to Ramone.\nThe Ramones had one band member\nwho was admittedly and known\nto others as having OCD.\nAnd during that documentary,\nwhich I forget the name,\nI think it was called,\ncan't remember, anyway,\ncan't remember, hippocampal lapse there,\nbut in this documentary,\nthe band members describe Joey Ramone\nas leaving hotels, walking down the stairs\nto the parking lot, but then having\nto walk up and down them\nseven or eight times,\nand sometimes getting out of the van again\nand walking up and down\nthem seven or eight times\nand it always had to be a\ncertain number of times,\ngiven a certain number of stairs.\nThis appears, quote-unquote, crazy,\nbut of course, we don't want\nto think of this as crazy.\nThis is somebody who very\nlikely had full blown OCD.\nNow that particular\nexample, believe it or not,\nis not all that uncommon.\nIt just so happens that that example\nentailed certain compulsions and behaviors\nthat were overt and that\nother people could see.\nAnd you can imagine how\nthat would prevent somebody\nfrom moving about their daily life easily.\nA lot of people, as I mentioned before,\nhave obsessions and\ncompulsions that they hide\nand they do these little micro behaviors,\nor they'll just count off in their head\nas opposed to generating\nsome sort of walking up\nand downstairs or tapping\nor things of that sort.\nSo we have checking, we have repetition,\nand then there's order.\nOrder oftentimes is thought of\nas putting cleanliness\nor making sure everything is aligned\nand perfect and orderly.\nAnd oftentimes that is the case,\nbut there are other forms of order\nthat people with OCD can focus on\nin a obsessive and compulsive way.\nThings like incompleteness, the idea that\none can't walk away from something\nor stop doing something\nbecause something's not right\nor complete in that picture.\nIt could be the way the table is set.\nIt could be the way that\nsomething's written on a page.\nIt could be an email.\nAgain, now we're still talking\nabout OCD, the disorder.\nWe're not talking about\nobsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nI'm aware of, well, I'll just be direct,\nseveral colleagues of mine\nand it's just remarkable,\nthe order in their emails.\nEvery email is perfect,\npunctuated, perfect,\ngrammar, perfect,\neverything's spaced perfect.\nDo they have OCD?\nWell, they might, they might not.\nHow would I know unless\nthey disclose that to me.\nBut they might have obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder, or\nthey just might be able\nto generate a lot of order\nand they have a lot of discipline\naround the way they write,\nand the way they present\nany communication with anybody at all.\nSo if somebody has a OCD\nthat's in the domain of order,\nit could be incompleteness\nand the constant feeling\nof something not being completed\nand a need to complete it.\nIt can also be in terms of symmetry,\nthat everything be aligned\nin symmetric in some way.\nThis could be seen perhaps in young kids.\nThis is one example that\nI read in the literature\nof children that need to\narrange their stuffed animals\nin exact same order every day\nand in a particular order to the point\nwhere if you were to move\nthe little stuffed frog\nover next to the stuffed rabbit,\nthat the child would have\nan anxiety reaction to that\nand feel literally\ncompelled, driven to fix that\nmaybe even multiple times\nover and over again.\nWe'll talk about OCD in children\nversus adults in a little bit.\nAnd then the other aspect of order,\nwhich is a little bit less than intuitive,\nis this notion of disgust,\nthis idea that something is contaminated.\nSo we often think about OCD\nand hand washing behavior\nin response to people feeling\nthat something is contaminated,\na space, a towel, et cetera,\nor even simply somebody else's hand\nand so they're unwilling\nto shake somebody's hand.\nYou can imagine how these\ndifferent bins of obsessions\nand compulsions, checking\nrepetition and order\nbe extremely debilitating\ndepending on how severe\nthey are and how many\ndifferent domains of life\nthey show up in.\nBecause oftentimes in movies\nand even the way I'm describing it now\nit sounds as if, okay, well\nsomebody has to check the locks\nbut they don't have to\nalso check the stove,\nor somebody has the need to\ncount to seven back and forth\nup to seven and down to seven seven times\nseven times a day or\nsomething of that sort\nwhere they need symmetry in\nvery specific domains of life.\nBut it turns out that this recurrent\nand intrusive aspect of obsessions\nleads people with OCD\nto have checking repetition\nand/or order compulsions everywhere.\nSo whether or not somebody\nis at work or in school\nor trying to engage in sport\nor trying to engage in relationship\nor just something simple\nlike walking down the street,\nthe obsessions are so\nintrusive that they show up\nand they compel people to\ndo things in that domain\nindependent of whether or not\nthey happen to be in\none location or another.\nIn other words, the thought patterns\nand the behaviors take\nover the environment\nas opposed to the environment\ndriving the thought\npatterns and behaviors.\nSo it therefore becomes impossible\nto ever find a room that's clean enough,\nto find a bed that's made well enough,\nto find anything that's done well enough\nto remove the obsession.\nAnd I know I've said\nit multiple times now,\nbut I'm going to say it many\ntimes throughout this episode\nin a somewhat obsessive,\nbut I believe justified way\nthat every time that one\nengages in the compulsion\nrelated to the obsession,\nthe obsession simply becomes stronger.\nSo you can imagine what a powerful\nand debilitating loop that really is.\nSo let's drill a little bit deeper\ninto how the obsessions and compulsions\nrelate to one another.\nIf we were to draw a line\nbetween the obsessions\nand the compulsions, that\nline could be described\nas anxiety.\nNow, we need to define what anxiety is\nand to be quite honest,\nmost of psychology and science can't agree\non exactly what anxiety is.\nTypically the way we think about fear\nis that it's a heightened\nstate of autonomic arousal,\nso increased heart rate,\nincreased breathing,\nsweating, et cetera, in\nresponse to an immediate\nand present threat or perceived threat.\nWhereas anxiety, generally speaking\nin the scientific literature,\nrelates to the same\nsorts of thought patterns\nand somatic bodily responses, heart rate,\nbreathing, et cetera,\nbut without a clear and present danger\nbeing in the environment or right there.\nSo that's the way that we're\ngoing to talk about anxiety now.\nAnd anxiety is really\nwhat binds the obsessions\nand compulsions such\nthat someone will have\nan intrusive thought.\nSo for instance, someone\nwill have the thought that\nif they turn left on any street,\nthat something bad will happen.\nOkay, that's an obsession.\nIt's actually not all that uncommon.\nNow, how bad and what the specificity\nof that bad thing really is will vary.\nSome people will think, if I turn left,\nsomething generally bad will happen,\nit just makes me feel anxious,\nSo they always insist on going right.\nWhereas other people will\nthink if I turn left,\nso and so will die, or I will die,\nor something terrible will happen,\nI'll get a disease or someone\nelse will get a disease\nor I'll be cursing myself or somebody else\nin some very specific way.\nThis is unfortunately quite\ncommon in people with OCD.\nSo they have this feeling\nand the feeling can be generally\nor specifically related\nto a particular outcome.\nBut beneath that is a feeling of anxiety,\na quickening of the heartbeat,\na quickening of breathing,\na narrowing of one's visual focus.\nI've talked about this\nbefore in another podcast,\nthe Master Stress, another podcast\nbut if you haven't heard those,\nlet me just briefly describe\nthat when we are in a state of increased\nso-called autonomic arousal, alertness,\nstress, et cetera,\nour visual field literally narrows,\nthe aperture of our\nvisual field gets smaller\nand that's because of the relationship\nbetween the autonomic nervous system\nand your visual system, so\nyou start seeing the world\nthrough sort of soda straw view\nor through binocular-like view,\nas opposed to seeing the big picture.\nWhy is that important?\nWell, it literally sharpens\nand narrows your focus\ntoward the very thing that the obsessions\nand the compulsions are focused on.\nSo the person walking\ndown the street who sees\nthe opportunity to go left or right\nwill only see the bad decision,\ntheir visual field narrows very tightly\nalong that possibility\nof taking a left turn.\nAnd I know as I describe this\nseems totally irrational,\nbut I want to emphasize\nthat the person with OCD\nknows it's irrational.\nThey might feel crazy because\nthey're having these thoughts,\nbut they know it makes no sense whatsoever\nthat left somehow would\nbe different than right\nin terms of outcomes in\nthis particular case,\nand yet it feels as if it would.\nIn fact, in some cases it\nfeels as if they went left,\nthey would have a full blown panic attack.\nSo the idea here is that the\nobsessions and compulsions\nare bound by anxiety, but then by taking\na right-hand turn, again, in\nthis one particular example,\nby taking a right-hand\nturn, there's a very brief,\nI should mention, very\nbrief relief of that anxiety\nat the time of the decision\nto go right, not left\nand there's an additional drop in anxiety\nwhile one takes the right-hand turn\nas opposed to the left-hand turn.\nAnd then as I alluded to before,\nthere's a reinforcement of the compulsion.\nIn other words, by going right,\nit doesn't create a situation in the brain\nand psychology of the person\nthat, oh, you know what,\nI'm not anxious anymore, left\nwould've probably been okay.\nIt reinforces the idea that\nright made me feel better,\nor turning right made me feel better,\nand going left would've\nbeen that much worse.\nAgain, it reinforces the\nobsession even further.\nAnd again, we could swap out\nright turns and left turns\nwith something like hand washing,\nthe feeling that something is contaminated\nand the need to wash one's hands\neven though one already washed their hands\n20, 30, 50 times prior.\nAnd we're actually going\nto go back to that example\na little bit later when we talk about\none particular category of therapies\nthat are very effective\nin many people for OCD\nwhich are the cognitive\nbehavioral and exposure therapies.\nI think some of you have heard\nof cognitive behavioral\nand exposure therapies,\nbut the way they're used to treat OCD\nis very much different\nthan the way they're used\nto treat other sorts of anxiety disorders\nand other sorts of disorders generally.\nSo it's fair to say that up\nto 70% of people with OCD\nhave some sort of anxiety\nor elevated anxiety,\neither directly related to the OCD\nor indirectly related to the OCD\nand it's really hard to tease those apart\nbecause OCD can create its own anxiety,\nas I mentioned before, it can\neven increase its own anxiety.\nAnd there's also an issue of depression.\nHaving OCD can be very depressing,\nespecially if some of these\nOCD thoughts and behaviors\nstart to really impede people's ability\nto function in life.\nAt work, and school, and relationship,\nthey can start feeling\nless optimistic about life.\nAnd in fact, some people can\nbecome suicidally depressed.\nThat's how bad OCD can be for us.\nSo we have to be careful when saying\nthat 70% of people with\nOCD also have anxiety\nor X number of people with\nOCD are also depressed\nbecause we don't know whether or not\nthe depression led the OCD\nor the other way around\nor whether or not they're operating,\nas we say in science, in parallel.\nSome of the drug treatments\nfor OCD and depression\nand anxiety can tease some of that apart\nand we'll talk about that,\nbut I think it's fair to say that\nwhat binds the obsessions\nand compulsions is anxiety,\nthat there's a feeling of,\nor I should say an\nurgent feeling of a need\nto get rid of the obsession.\nAnd the person feels as if the only way\nthey can do that is to engage\nin a particular compulsive behavior.\nSome people are probably wondering\nif there's a genetic component to OCD\nand indeed there is,\nalthough the nature of\nit isn't exactly clear.\nAnd oftentimes when\npeople hear that something\nhas a genetic component,\nthey think it's always directly\ninherited from a parent,\nand that's not always the case.\nThere can be genes that\nsurface in siblings\nor genes that surface in children\nthat are not readily apparent\nin terms of what we call a phenotype.\nSo you have a genotype, the gene,\nand then you have a\nphenotype, the way it shows up\nas a body form or like eye color\nor how it shows up in terms of a behavior\nor behavioral pattern.\nBased on twin studies where researchers\nhave examined identical\ntwins, fraternal twins,\neven identical twins that\nshare the same sack in utero,\nthe what we call monochorionic,\nso sitting in the same\nlittle bag during pregnancy\nor in different little bags,\nyou can see different levels\nof what's called genetic concordance.\nBut if we were to just\nsort of cut a broad swath\nthrough all of the genetic data,\nit's fair to say that about\n40 to 50% of OCD cases\nhave some genetic component,\nsome mutation or some\ninherited aspect that's genetic\nand that one could point to\nif they got their genome mapped.\nNow, while that's interesting,\nI don't think it's terribly\nuseful for most people.\nFirst of all, you can't\nreally control your genes,\nat least at this point in history,\neven though there are things\nlike epigenetic control\nand people are very\nexcited about technologies\nlike CRISPR for modifying the genome\nin humans at some point,\nmost people can't control\ntheir genetics, right?\nYou can't pick who your\nparents were as they say.\nSo just know that there\nis a genetic component\nin about half of people\nwith OCD, but not always.\nNow as is typical for this podcast,\nI want to focus on some\nof the neural mechanisms\nand chemical systems in the brain and body\nthat generate\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn fact, if you've watched\nthis podcast before,\nlisten to this podcast before,\nthis is always how I structure things.\nFirst, we introduce a topic\nand we explore that topic in detail\nand really define what\nit is and what it isn't.\nAnd then it's very\nimportant that we focus on\nwhat is known and what is not known\nabout the biological\nmechanisms that generate\nwhatever that thing happens\nto be, in this case,\nOCD and obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nNow I want to emphasize\nthat even if you don't have\na background in biology,\nI will make this information\naccessible to you.\nAnd I also want to emphasize\nthat for those of you\nthat are interested in treatments\nand are anxiously awaiting\nthe description of things\nthat can help with OCD, I encourage you,\nif you will, to please try and digest\nsome of the material about\nthe underlying mechanisms\nbecause understanding\neven just a little bit\nof those biological\nmechanisms can really help\nshed light on why particular drug\nand behavioral treatments\nand other sorts of treatments\nwork and don't work.\nThis is especially\nimportant in the case of OCD\nwhere it turns out that the order\nand type of treatment can really vary\naccording to individual,\nand that's something really\nspecial and important about OCD\nthat we really can't say\nfor a number of the other\nsorts of disorders that we've described\non previous podcasts.\nSo let's take a step back\nand look at the neural circuitry.\nWhat's going on in the brain\nand body of people with OCD?\nWhy the intrusive recurrent thoughts?\nWhy the compulsions?\nWhy is that whole system bound by anxiety?\nAnd in some ways in thinking about that,\nI want you to keep in mind\nthat the brain has two main functions.\nThe brain's main functions are\nto take care of all\nthe housekeeping stuff,\nmake sure digestion works,\nmake sure the heart beats,\nmake sure you keep\nbreathing no matter what,\nmake sure that you can see, you can hear,\nyou can smell, et cetera,\nthe basic stuff, and then\nthere's an enormous amount\nof brain real estate that's designed\nto allow you to predict\nwhat's going to happen next,\neither in the immediate future\nor in the long-term future.\nAnd largely that's done based\non your knowledge of the past.\nSo you also have memory systems.\nAnd of course you have\nsystems in the brain and body\nthat are designed to bind what's happening\nat the housekeeping level,\nlike your heart rate,\nto your anticipation of\nwhat's going to happen next.\nSo if you're thinking about\nsomething very fearful,\nyour body will have one type of reaction.\nIf you're thinking about\nsomething very pleasant\nand relaxing, your body will\nhave another type of reaction.\nSo whenever I hear about\nthe brain-body distinction,\nI have to just remind everybody\nthat there really is no distinction\nbetween brain and body\nwhen you think about it\nthrough the nervous system.\nThe nervous system is the brain,\nthe eyes, the spinal cord,\nbut of course all their connections\nwith all the organs of the body\nand the connections of\nall the organs of the body\nwith the brain, the\nspinal cord, et cetera.\nSo as I describe these neural circuits,\nI don't want you to think of them\nas just things happening in the head,\nthey are certainly happening in the head,\nin fact, the circuits all\ndescribed most in detail\ndo exist within the confines\nof your cranial vault,\nthat's nerd speak for skull,\nbut those circuits are\ndriving particular predictions\nand therefore particular biases\ntowards particular actions in your body.\nThey're creating a state of readiness\nor a state of desire to\ncheck or desire to count\nor desire to avoid et cetera, et cetera.\nSo what are these circuits?\nWell, there's been a lot\nof wonderful research\nexploring the neural circuit's underlying\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nand that's mainly been accomplished\nthrough a couple of methods.\nMost of those methods\nwhen applied in humans\ninvolve getting some look\ninto which brain areas\nare active when people\nare having obsessions\nand when people are\nengaging in compulsions.\nNow that might seem simple to do,\nbut of course your brain is\nhoused inside the cranial vault.\nAnd in order to look inside it,\nyou have to use things like\nmagnetic resonance imaging,\nwhich is just fancy technology\nfor looking at blood flow,\nwhich relates to activation\nof neurons, nerve cells,\nor things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,\nwhich has nothing to do with the verb pet\nand has nothing to do with your house pet,\nhas everything to do with\npositron emission tomography,\nwhich is just another way of seeing\nwhich brain areas are active\nand then you can also\nuse PET to figure out\nwhat sorts of neurochemicals are active,\nlike dopamine, et cetera.\nMany studies, we can fairly say dozens\nif not hundreds of studies,\nhave now identified a particular circuit\nor loop of brain areas\nthat are interconnected\nand very active in\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nThat loop includes the cortex,\nwhich is kind of the outer\nshell of the human brain.\nThe lumpy stuff, as\nit's sometimes appears,\nif the skull is removed.\nAnd it involves an area\ncalled the striatum\nwhich is involved in action selection\nand holding back action.\nThe striatum is involved\nin what's commonly called\ngo and no-go types of behaviors.\nSo every type of behavior\nlike picking up a pen\nor a mug of coffee involves\na go type function.\nIt involves generating an action.\nBut every time I resist an action,\nmy nervous system is also doing that\nusing this brain structure, the striatum,\nwhich includes, among other\nthings, the basal ganglia.\nWe've talked about that before.\nI'm not trying to overload\nyou with terminology here,\nbut I know some people are\ninterested in terminology.\nSo you have go behaviors\nand you have no-go,\nresisting of behaviors,\nnot going toward behavior.\nThe cortex and the striatum\nare in this intricate\nback and forth talk.\nIt's really loops of connections.\nThe cortex doesn't tell\nthe striatum what to do,\nthe striatum doesn't tell\nthe cortex what to do.\nThey're in a crosstalk.\nLike any good relationship, there's a lot\nof back and forth communication.\nThere's a third element in\nthis cortico-striatal loop\nas it's called, and that's the thalamus.\nNow, the thalamus is not a structure\nI've talked a lot about\nbefore on this podcast,\nbut it's one of my favorite\nstructures to think about\nand teach about in neuroanatomy,\nwhich I teach back at Stanford\nand I've taught for many years elsewhere\nbecause the thalamus is this incredible\negg-like structure in\nthe center of your brain\nthat has different channels through it.\nChannels for relaying visual information\nor auditory information\nor touch information\nfrom your environment up into your cortex,\nand as a consequence,\nmaking certain things\nthat are happening to you and around you\napparent to you, making you aware of them,\nmaking you perceive them\nand suppressing others.\nSo for instance, right now,\nif you're hearing me say this,\nyour thalamus has what are\ncalled auditory nuclei,\nthere's collections of neurons\nthat respond to sound waves\nthat are of course coming\nin through your ears,\nand your thalamus is active in a way\nthat those particular\nregions of your thalamus\nare allowed, literally permitted\nto pass the information\ncoming from your ears\nthrough some other steps\nbut then to your thalamus,\nyour auditory thalamus,\nthen up to your cortex and you can hear\nwhat I'm saying right now.\nAt the same time, your\nthalamus is surrounded\nby a kind of a shell,\nsomething called the\nthalamic reticular nucleus.\nAgain, you don't have\nto remember the names,\nbut this thalamic reticular nucleus,\nalso sometimes called the\nreticular thalamic nucleus,\nthis is, believe it or not, a\nsubject of debate in science.\nThere are people that\nliterally hated each other,\nprobably still hate each other,\neven though one of them\nis dead for decades,\nbecause they would argue it\nwas thalamic reticular nucleus,\nthe other was reticular thalamic nucleus.\nAnyway, these are scientists,\nthey're people, they tend to debate.\nbut the thalamic reticular nucleus,\nas I'm going to call it,\nserves as a sort of gate\nas to which information\nis allowed to pass through\nup to your conscious\nexperience, and which is not.\nAnd that gating mechanism\nis strongly regulated\nby the chemical GABA.\nGABA is a neurotransmitter\nthat is inhibitory, as we say,\nit serves to shut down\nor suppress the activity\nof other neurons.\nSo the thalamic reticular\nnucleus is really saying,\nno, touch information\ncannot come in right now.\nYou should not be\nthinking about the contact\nof the back of your legs with the chair\nthat you're sitting on, Andrew,\nyou should be thinking about\nwhat you're trying to say\nand what you're hearing\nand how your voice sounds\nand what you see in\nfront of you, et cetera.\nWhereas if I'm about to get\nan injection from a doctor\nor I'm in pain, or I'm in pleasure,\nI'm going to think about\nmy somatic sensation\nat the level of touch\nand I'm probably going to think less\nabout smells in the room,\nalthough I might also think\nabout smells in the room\nor what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.\nWe can combine all these\ndifferent sensory modalities,\nbut the thalamic reticular nucleus\nreally allows us to funnel,\nto direct particular categories\nof sensory experience\ninto our conscious awareness\nand suppress other categories\nof sensory experience.\nIn addition, the thalamic\nreticular nucleus\nplays a critical role in which thoughts\nare allowed to pass up to\nour conscious perception\nand which ones are not,\nso much so that some neuroscientists\nand indeed some neurophilosophers,\nif you want call them that,\nhave theorized or philosophized that\nthe thalamic reticular nucleus\nis actually involved in our consciousness.\nNow, consciousness isn't a topic\nthat I really want to\ntalk about this episode\nand it's a very kind of mushy-murky,\nas we say in science, it's a shmooey term\nbecause it doesn't really\nhave clear definitions\nso arguments about it often get lost\nin the fact that people are\narguing about different things.\nBut when I say consciousness,\nwhat I mean is conscious awareness.\nSo let's zoom out and\ntake a look at the circuit\nthat we've got and that we now know\nbased on neuroimaging studies is\nintimately involved in\ngenerating obsessions\nand compulsions in OCD.\nWe have a cortex or neocortex,\nwhich is involved in\nperception and understanding\nof what's happening.\nWe have the striatum and basal ganglia,\nwhich are involved in\ngenerating behaviors, go,\nand suppressing behaviors, no-go.\nAnd we have the thalamus which collects\nall of our sensory experience in parallel,\nhearing, touch, smell, et cetera,\nnot so much smell through the\nthalamus, I should mention,\nbut the other senses that is.\nAnd then that thalamus is encased\nby the thalamic reticular\nnucleus, which serves\nas a kind of a guard\nsaying you can pass through\nand you can pass through,\nbut you, you, you\ncan't pass through up to conscious\nunderstanding and perception.\nSo that loop, this\ncortico-striatal-thalamic loop,\ncortico-striatal-thalamic\nloop is the circuit\nthought to underlie OCD,\nand dysfunction in that circuit\nis what's thought to underlie OCD.\nNow, again, this circuit\nexists in all of us\nand it can operate in healthy ways,\nor it can operate in ways\nthat make us feel unhealthy\nor even suffer from full blown OCD.\nHow do we know that this\ncircuit is involved in OCD?\nWell there, we can look to\nsome really interesting studies\nthat involve bringing human\nsubjects into the laboratory\nand generating their\nobsessions and compulsions\nand then imaging their brain using\nany variety of techniques\nthat we talked about before.\nWhat would such an experiment look like?\nWell, in order to do\nthat sort of experiment,\nfirst of all, you need people who have OCD\nand of course you need\ncontrol subjects that don't,\nand you need to be able to reliably evoke\nthe obsessions and the compulsions.\nNow, it turns out this is\nmost easily, or I should say\nmost simply done, 'cause it can't be easy\nfor the people with OCD,\nbut this is most straightforward,\nthat's the word I was looking for,\nmost straightforward when\nlooking at the category\nof obsessions and compulsions that relate\nto order and cleanliness.\nSo what they do typically\nis bring subjects\ninto the laboratory who have a obsession\nabout germs and contamination\nand a compulsion to hand wash,\nand they give these\npeople, believe it or not,\na sweaty towel that contains the sweat\nand the odor and the\nliquid, basically, from\nsomebody else's hands.\nIn fact, they'll sometimes have someone\nwipe their own sweat off\nthe back of their neck\nand put it on the towel\nand then they'll put it\nin front of the person,\nwhich as you can imagine\nfor someone with OCD is\nincredibly anxiety-provoking\nand almost always evokes\nthese obsessions about,\nugh, this is really, this is really bad.\nThis is really bad, I need to clean,\nI need to clean. I need to clean.\nNow they're doing all this while someone\nis in a brain scanner or\nwhile they're being imaged\nfor positron emission tomography.\nAnd then they can also look at\nthe patterns of activation in the brain\nwhile the person is doing hand washing.\nAlthough sometimes the apparati\nassociated with these imaging studies\nmake it hard to do a lot of movement,\nthey can do these sorts of studies.\nThey have done these sorts of studies\nin many subjects using\ndifferent variations\nof what I just described.\nAnd low and behold what lights up?\nAnd when I say lights up,\nwhat sorts of brain regions\nare more metabolically\nactive, more blood flow,\nmore neural activity?\nWell, it's this particular\ncortico-striatal-thalamic loop.\nIn addition to that,\nsome of the drug treatments\nthat are effective in some,\nand I want to emphasize some individuals,\nat suppressing obsessions\nand or compulsions\nsuch as the selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors\nor SSRIs, which we'll talk\nabout in a little bit,\nwhen people take those drugs,\nthey see not just a suppression of\nthe obsession and compulsion,\nbut also a suppression of these\nparticular neural circuits.\nThey become less active.\nNow I want to emphasize\nand telegraph a little bit\nof what's coming later,\nthese drugs like SSRIs do not\nwork for everybody with OCD.\nAnd as many of you know,\nthey carry other certain\nproblems and side effects\nfor many but not all individuals.\nBut nonetheless, what we have now\nis an observation that this circuit,\nthe cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,\nis active in OCD.\nWe have a manipulation that\nwhen people take a drug\nthat at least in those individuals\nis effective in suppressing or eliminating\nthe obsessions and compulsions,\nthere's less activity in this loop.\nAnd thanks to some very\ngood animal model studies,\nthat at least at this point in time,\nyou really couldn't do in humans,\nalthough soon that may change,\nwe now know in a causal way\nthat the equivalent circuitry\nexists in other animals,\nsuch as mice, such as\ncats, such as monkeys,\nand that activation of those particular\ncortico-striatal-thalamic circuits\nin animal models can indeed evoke OCD\nin an individual that prior to that\ndid not have OCD.\nSo I'm just going to\nbriefly describe one study.\nThis is a now classic study published\nin the journal Science,\none of the three apex journals in 2013.\nThe first author on this paper\nis Susanne Ahmari, A-H-M-A-R-I.\nI will provide a link to\nthis in the show notes.\nIt's a truly landmark paper done\nin Rene Hen's lab at Columbia University.\nAnd the title of the paper\nis repeated cortico-striatal\nstimulation generates,\nthat's the key word here,\ngenerates persistent OCD-like behavior.\nWhat they did is they took mice,\nmice do mouse things.\nThey move around, they play with toys,\nthey eat, they pee, they mate,\nthey do various things in their cage,\nbut they also groom.\nHumans groom, animals with fur groom,\nWell, you hope most people groom,\nsome people over-groom,\nsome people under-groom,\nbut most people groom.\nThey'll comb their hair,\nthey'll clean, et cetera.\nThose are normal behaviors\nthat humans engage in.\nI'm not aware that mice comb their hair,\nbut mice adjust their hair.\nSo they'll kind of pet their hair\nand they'll do this.\nThey'll sometimes even\ndo it to each other.\nWe used to have mice in the lab,\nnow we only do human studies,\nbut the mice will groom themselves,\nand typical, what we call wild type mice,\nnot because they're wild,\nbut because they're typical,\nwill groom themselves at\na particular frequency,\nbut not to the point where\ntheir hair is falling out.\nNot constantly, they are\ngrooming some of the time\nand they're doing other mouse\nthings other mouse times.\nSo in this particular study,\nwhat they did is they\nused some technology,\nwhich it actually was discussed\non a previous episode of\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nthis is technology that was\ndeveloped by a psychiatrist\nand bioengineer by the\nname of Karl Deisseroth,\none of my colleagues at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nThis is technology that allows researchers\nto use the presentation of light\nto control neural activity\nin particular brain areas\nin a very high fidelity way.\nYou control the activity in\nthe cortex of the striatum\nor the thalamus when you\nwant and how you want.\nIt's really a beautiful technology.\nIn any event, what they\ndid in this study is,\nor I should say what Susan Ahmari\nand colleagues did in this study\nwas to stimulate the\ncortico-striatal circuitry\nin animals that did not\nhave any OCD-like behavior.\nAnd when they did that,\nthose animals started grooming incessantly\nto the point where their hair\nwas falling out or they even,\nthey didn't take the experiments\nthis far, fortunately,\nbut the animals would have a tendency\nto almost rub themselves raw\nin the same way that\nsomebody who has a compulsion\nto hand wash would, sadly,\npeople will hand wash\nto the point where their hands\nare actually bleeding and raw.\nIt's really that bad.\nI know that's tough imagery to imagine,\nand you can't even imagine\nwhy someone would self harm\nin that way, but again,\nthat's that incredible anxiety\nrelationship between the\ncompulsion, excuse me,\nthe obsession and the compulsion,\nand the fact that\nengaging in the compulsion\nsimply strengthens the obsession\nand therefore the anxiety.\nSo that collection of studies, of data,\nFMRI, PET scanning in humans,\nthe treatment with SSRIs,\nand these experiments where\nresearchers have actively triggered\nthese particular circuits in animal models\nthat previously did not have\ntoo much activity in these circuits\nand then they observe OCD emerging\nreally points squarely to the fact\nthat the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop\nis likely to be the basis of OCD.\nNow, of course, other circuits\ncould also be involved,\nbut the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit\nseems to be the main circuit\ngenerating OCD-like behavior.\nThat's a lot of mechanism.\nHopefully it was described in a way\nthat you can digest and understand.\nAnd some of you might be\nthinking, well, so what?\nWhy does that help me?\nI mean, I can't reach into my brain\nand turn off my cortex.\nI can't reach into my brain\nand turn off my thalamus.\nAnd indeed, on the one hand, that's true.\nBut as you'll next learn\nwhen thinking about the\nvarious behavioral treatments\nand drug treatments\nand holistic treatments for OCD,\nwhat you'll notice is that each one taps\ninto a different component\nof this cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.\nAnd by understanding\nthat, you can start to see\nwhy certain treatments\nmight work at one stage\nof the illness versus others.\nYou will also start to understand why\nobsessive-compulsive personality disorder\ndoes not have the same\nsorts of engagements\nof these neural loops,\nand yet relies on other\naspects of brain and body\nand therefore responds best\nto other sorts of treatments.\nOr in some cases, people\nwith obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder are\nnot even seeking treatment\nas I alluded to before.\nThe point here is that by understanding\nthe underlying mechanism\nwhy certain drugs and\nbehavioral treatments work\nand don't work will become\nimmediately apparent\nand in thinking about\nthat, in knowing that,\nyou'll be able to make excellent choices,\nI believe, in terms of what\nsorts of treatments you pursue,\nwhat sorts of treatments you abandon,\nand most importantly, the order,\nthe sequence that you pursue\nand apply those treatments.\nBefore we go any further,\nI'd like to give people\na little bit of a window into\nwhat a diagnosis for OCD would look like.\nGive you a sense of the sorts of questions\nthat a clinician would ask to determine\nwhether or not somebody has OCD or not.\nNow, I want to be clear,\nI'm not going to do this\nin an exhaustive way.\nI wouldn't want anyone to self-diagnose.\nAlthough I'm hoping that\nby sharing some of this,\nthat some of you might get insight\ninto whether or not you do have obsessions\nand compulsions that\nmight qualify for OCD,\nand perhaps even to seek out help.\nThe most commonly used test of OCD,\nor for OCD, I should say,\nis called the Yale-Brown\nObsessive Compulsive Scale.\nAnd this is, scientists love acronyms\nas do the military, and it's the Y-BOCS,\nthe Y-B-O-C-S, the Y-BOCS.\nSo typically someone\nwill go into the clinic\neither because a family\nmember encouraged them to\nor because they feel\nthat they're suffering\nfrom obsessions and compulsions,\nand before the clinician would proceed\nwith any kind of direct questions,\nthey would very clearly define\nwhat obsessions and compulsions are.\nAnd here I'm actually\nreading from the Y-BOCS.\nSo quote, \"obsessions are\nunwelcome and distressing ideas,\nthoughts, images or impulses\nthat repeatedly enter your mind.\nThey may seem to occur against your will.\nThey may be repugnant to you,\nyou may recognize them as senseless\nand they may not fit your personality.\"\nThen there are compulsions.\nQuote, \"Compulsions, on the other hand,\nare behaviors or acts that\nyou feel driven to perform\nalthough you may recognize\nthem as senseless or excessive.\nAt times, you may try to resist doing them\nbut this may prove difficult.\nYou may experience anxiety\nthat does not diminish\nuntil the behavior is completed.\"\nAnd as I mentioned before in many cases,\nimmediately after the\nbehavior has completed,\nthe anxiety doesn't just return,\nit indeed can strengthen.\nNow, there are a tremendous\nnumber of questions\non the Y-BOCS.\nSo I'm just going to highlight\na few of the general categories.\nTypically, the person\nwill fill out a checklist,\nso they will designate whether or not\ncurrently or in the past they have,\nfor instance, aggressive obsessions,\nfear that one might harm themselves,\nfear that one might harm others,\nfear that they'll steal things,\nfear that they will act\non unwanted impulses,\ncurrently or in the past or both,\nthat's one category.\nThe other one are\ncontamination obsessions.\nSo concern with dirt or germs,\nbothered by sticky substances or residues,\net cetera, et cetera.\nSo there are a bunch\nof different categories\nthat include, for instance,\nsexual obsessions,\nwhat are called saving obsessions,\neven moral obsessions,\nexcess concern with right\nor wrong or morality,\nconcerned with sacrilege and blasphemy,\nobsession with need for\nsymmetry and exactness.\nAgain, all of these\nquestions being answered\nas either present in the past\nor not present in the past,\npresent currently or\nnot present currently.\nAnd then the test generally\ntransitions over to questions\nabout target symptoms.\nThey really try and get people to identify\nif they have obsessions, what\nare their exact obsessions?\nNow, this turns out to be really important\nbecause as we talk about some\nof the therapies that really work,\nI'll just give away a little bit\nof why they work best in certain cases\nand why they don't work\nas well in other cases,\nit turns out that it\nbecomes very important\nfor the clinician and the patient\nto not just identify the obsessions\nand the compulsions generally\nin a kind of a generic or top contour way,\nbut to really encourage\nor even force the patient\nto define very precisely what the biggest,\nmost catastrophic fear is,\nwhat the obsession really relates to.\nThat turns out to be very important\nin disrupting this\ncortico-striatal-thalamic loop\nand getting relief from symptoms\none way or the other.\nSo the Yale-Brown Obsessive\nCompulsive Scale, this Y-BOCS,\nagain, is very extensive,\nit goes on for dozens of pages actually,\nand has all these different categories,\nnot so much designed to just pinpoint\nwhat people obsess about\nor what they feel compelled to do,\nbut to also try and identify\nwhat is the fear that's driving all this.\nIn the way that we've\nset this up thus far,\nwe've been talking about\nobsessions and compulsions\nis kind of existing in a vacuum.\nYou're obsessed about germs\nand you're compelled to wash your hands,\nobsessed about germs,\ncompelled to wash your hands.\nOr obsessed about symmetry,\ncompelled to put right\nangles on everything.\nOr obsessed about counting\nand therefore counting, et cetera.\nBut beneath that\nis a cognitive component\nthat is not at all apparent\nfrom someone describing their obsession\nand from someone describing or\ndisplaying their compulsion.\nThe deeper layer to all\nthat is what is the fear,\nexactly, if one were to\nnot perform the compulsion,\nmeaning what is the fear\nthat's driving the obsession?\nSo that brings us to a\nvery powerful category\nof treatments that I\nshould say does not work\nin everybody with OCD\nbut works in many people with OCD\nand really speaks to the\nunderlying neural circuitry\nthat generates OCD and\nhow to interrupt it.\nAnd that is the treatment\nof cognitive behavioral therapy\nand in particular,\nexposure-based cognitive\nbehavioral therapy.\nSo we're going to talk about\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nand exposure therapy now,\nbut right at the outset,\nI want to distinguish the kinds\nof cognitive behavioral therapy\nand exposure therapies that are done\nfor obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nfor the sorts of cognitive\nbehavioral therapies\nthat are done for other types\nof mental challenges and disorders\nbecause cognitive\nbehavioral therapy for OCD\nreally has everything to do\nwith identifying the utmost fear.\nIn some sense, we can think of fears\nas kind of along a hierarchy.\nAn the example earlier of somebody\nbeing afraid to turn left and therefore\nfeeling compelled to turn right,\nyou would want to take that person\nand really understand\nwhat do they fear most\nabout turning left?\nNow they might not be aware of it.\nThey might not be conscious\nto what that really is,\nbut if you were to probe\nthem in a clinical setting,\nyou would eventually get to an answer.\nThat answer could be at first,\nI don't know, just, it's just bad.\nI don't know why it's\nbad, it makes no sense,\nbut it's just bad.\nI do not want to go left.\nI don't know why, I don't know why.\nBut if you were to push\nthat person a little bit\nin a respectful and kind and caring way\naimed at their treatment,\nif you were to push 'em and say,\nwell, what do you mean by bad?\nIf you turn left, you\nthink the world would end?\nThey might say, no, the\nworld's not going to end,\nbut you know, someone is\ngoing to die suddenly.\nI know that sounds crazy, but\nsomebody's going to die suddenly.\nThis almost sounds like superstition,\nwe'll talk about superstitions later,\nbut indeed it is somewhat superstitious.\nSo for instance, you would\nsay, who's going to die?\nAnd they'd say, I don't know.\nAnd you'd say, no, really\nwho's going to die?\nIf you think about this,\nare you going to die?\nIs so and so going to die?\nAnd very often,\nvery often what you find is that\npeople will start to\nreveal the underlying obsession\nat a level of detail that\nboth to the clinician\nand to them can be somewhat astonishing\neven though they've been\nliving with that detail\nin their mind for a very long time.\nNow, how could somebody\nstart to reveal detail\nabout something that's\nexisted in their mind\nfor a very long time, but\nnot known about it, right?\nNot been aware of it.\nNow, some of you might think,\noh, it's repressed or something.\nThat's not at all what's happening.\nIf you think about the\narchitecture of OCD,\ntypically, people will have an obsession\nand then they'll engage in the compulsion\nas quickly as they can to\nrelieve that obsession.\nSo in many ways, the disease itself\nprevents people from ever\ngetting to the bottom\nof that trough, ever getting to the point\nwhere they really clearly\narticulate to themselves\nexactly what it is that they fear.\nBut it becomes so essential to articulate\nexactly what it is that they fear\nfor a somewhat counterintuitive reason.\nYou might think, oh,\nthe moment they realize\nexactly what they fear, everything lifts,\nthe circuit turns off\nand they just feel better\nbecause they realized it.\nI wish I could tell you that's the case,\nbut it turns out it's the opposite.\nWhat the clinician is\nactually trying to do\nis get people to feel\nmore anxiety, not less.\nWhat they're trying to get them to do\nis to short circuit, no pun intended,\nto intervene in their own neural circuit,\nI should say, with that relief of anxiety,\nhowever brief, brought on by engaging\nin the compulsion\nrelated to the obsession.\nSo, whereas typically someone would feel\nthe obsession with, ugh,\nI don't want to turn left\n'cause something bad's going to happen,\nsomeone's going to die,\nand then they turn right,\nthey never get the\noption or the opportunity\nto really explore what would happen\nwere they to turn left or to\nnot be able to turn right.\nBy forcing them down the path of inquiry,\nthat leads them to the place\nwhere they very clearly\nidentify the fear, the anxiety,\nit raises the anxiety in them,\nand that's actually what\nthe clinician is after.\nCognitive behavioral\ntherapy and exposure therapy\nin the context of OCD, most often involves\ntrying to get people to tolerate,\nnot relieve their anxiety.\nThis is extremely important.\nAnd I realize there's variation to this\ndepending on the style of\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\nthe style of exposure therapy,\nbut almost across the board,\nThe goal, again, is to get\npeople to feel the anxiety\nthat normally they are able\nto at least partially relieve,\nhowever briefly, by\nengaging in the compulsion.\nSo if we think back to that circuit\nof cortico-striatal-thalamic,\nwhat's going on here?\nWhere is CBT intervening?\nWhat part of the circuit\nis getting interrupted?\nWell, as you recall,\nthe cortex is involved\nin conscious perception.\nThe thalamus and that\nthalamic reticular nucleus\nare involved in the\npassage of certain types\nof experience up to our\nconscious perception, not others.\nAnd the striatum is involved\nin this go, no-go type behavior.\nWhen OCD is really expressing\nitself in its fullness,\npeople feel an anxiety\naround a particular thought\nand they either have a go,\nfor instance, wash hands,\nor a no-go, do not turn\nleft type reaction.\nBy having people progressively,\nin a kind of hierarchical way,\nreveal their precise source of anxiety,\ntheir utmost fear in this context,\nwhat happens is they feel enormous amounts\nof autonomic arousal.\nNow in the context of anxiety treatment\nor other types of treatments,\nthe goal would be to\nteach people to dampen,\nto lessen their anxiety\nthrough breathing techniques\nor through visualization techniques\nor through self-talk or\nthrough social support,\nany of the number of\nthings that are well-known\nto help people self\nregulate their own anxiety.\nHere, it's the opposite.\nWhat they're trying to\nget the patient to do\nis to really feel the\nanxiety at its maximum,\nbut then do the exact opposite\nof whatever the normal compulsion is.\nSo if normally the compulsion\nis to wash one's hands,\nthen the idea is to suppress hand washing\nwhile being in the experience\nof the utmost anxiety.\nOr in the case of not turning left,\nthe person is expected to\nor would hopefully be able\nto actually turn left,\nand as you can imagine, that\nwould evoke tremendous anxiety\nand yet to tolerate that anxiety.\nNow I want to be very clear,\nthis is not the sort of thing\nyou want to do on your own.\nThis is not the sort of thing\nyou want to do for a friend.\nThis is done by trained\nlicensed psychologists\nand psychiatrists.\nBut nonetheless, it\nreally points to the fact\nthat as a anxiety-related disorder,\nOCD is distinct from\nother types of anxiety\nand anxiety-related disorders,\nthings like PTSD and\npanic disorder, et cetera,\nbecause the goal again\nis to bring the person\nright up close to the thing\nthat they fear the most\nand then to interrupt the circuit.\nAnd now you should be able to know,\njust intuitively, 'cause you\nunderstand the mechanisms,\nthat the circuit you're trying to disrupt\nis the pattern of information flow\nfrom the thinking part of the brain,\nthe perception part of the brain,\nwhich is the cortex, to the striatum.\nThe striatum has these\nneurons which are active\nthat essentially are, I\nknow it sounds a little bit\nlike a discussion about free will,\nbut they're trying to get some,\nthe person to generate a certain behavior,\nsuppress a certain behavior.\nAnd as anxiety ramps up,\nit's sort of a hydraulic\npressure to do that very thing\nthat they've done for so long\nand they suffer from so much.\nWe talked about hydraulic\npressure in the context\nof aggression in the aggression episode,\nthis is very similar.\nThere's a kind of a,\nnow when I say hydraulic pressure,\nit's not actual hydraulic pressure,\nit's the confluence of a\nlot of different systems.\nIt's neurochemicals, we'll soon learn,\nit's hormonal, it's electrical,\nit's a lot of different\nthings operating in parallel\nso we can't point to one\nchemical or transmitter.\nWhat's happening is the\nperson is feeling compelled\nto act, act, act to relieve the anxiety\nand through a progressive\ntype of exposure,\nyou don't throw people in the deep end\nin this kind of therapy right off the bat,\nyou gradually ratchet them toward\nor move them toward the discussion\nof exactly what they fear the most\nand then eventually move them toward\nthe interruption of the compulsion\nas they're feeling this\nextremely elevated anxiety,\nof course, within the context\nof a supportive clinical setting.\nBut in doing that, what\nyou are teaching people\nis that the anxiety can\nexist without the need\nto engage in the compulsion.\nNow some of this might\nsound to people like, oh,\nthis is a lot of kind of fancy\npsychological neuroscience speak\naround something that's kind of intuitive.\nBut I think for most people,\nthis is not intuitive.\nAnd for people with OCD,\nthere's no really other way to put it,\nthe impulse, the\ncompulsion to avoid anxiety\nis such a powerful driving force\nthat it should now make sense to you\nas to why being able to tolerate anxiety\nand really sit with it\nand do the exact opposite\nof what you're normally compelled to do\nis going to be the path to treatment.\nAnd indeed CBT has been shown\nto be enormously effective,\nagain for a large number\nof people with OCD,\nbut not all of them.\nAnd oftentimes it requires that it also be\nused in concert with\ncertain drug treatments,\nwhich we're going to\ntalk about in a moment.\nNext, let's talk about some\nof the really unique features\nof cognitive behavioral\ntherapy and exposure therapy\nin the context of OCD\nthat you often don't see\nin the use of CBT, that is\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\nfor other types of psychiatric\nchallenges and disorders.\nThe first element is one of stair casing.\nAnd I already mentioned this before,\nbut this gradual and progressive increase\nin the anxiety that you're\ntrying to evoke from the patient,\nfrom the person suffering from OCD.\nThat's done in the context of\nthe office or the laboratory,\nagain, by a trained\nand licensed clinician.\nBut then the person leaves, right?\nThey leave the office,\nthey leave the laboratory.\nAnd a very vital component\nof CBT and exposure\ntherapy for people with OCD\nis that they have and perform\nwhat's called homework,\nis literally what they call.\nThis might be seen in\nother sorts of treatments\nbut for OCD, homework\nis extremely important,\nbecause within the context\nof a laboratory experiment or the clinic,\npatients often feel so much support\nthat they can tolerate\nthose heightened levels\nof anxiety and interrupt\ntheir compulsions.\nWhereas when they get home,\noftentimes the familiarity\nof the environment\nbrings 'em to a place\nwhere all of a sudden\nthose obsessions and compulsions start\ninteracting the same way\nand they have a very hard time\nsuppressing the behaviors.\nWhy would that be?\nWell in neuroscience, we have a phrase,\nit's called conditioned place preference\nand conditioned place avoidance.\nThere's some other phrases too\nbut basically it all has to do\nwith a simple thing which is,\nwhen you feel something\nrepeatedly in a given environment,\nor sometimes even once\nwithin a given environment,\nyou tend to feel that same thing again\nwhen you return to that\nor similar environments.\nOkay, So conditioned place blank,\nor conditioned place that\nis simply fancy nerd speak\nfor the fact that when you're in a place\nand something good happens,\nyou tend to feel good if\nyou return to that place\nor a place like it, or\nif something bad happens\nin a given place, you tend to feel bad\nwhen you return to that\nplace or a place like it.\nI think that most salient\nexample that leaps to mind\nis in, unfortunately, the category of bad,\nbut I had some friends years\nago visit San Francisco.\nThere's been a ongoing,\nit seems like it's been happening forever,\nbut this is really in the last decade\nof daytime break-ins and\nnighttime break-ins into cars\nto steal anything from computers\nto what seems to be like a box of tissues.\nAnd there are numerous reasons for this,\nI don't want to get into,\nit's not the topic of today's podcast,\nbut I will use this as\nan opportunity to say\nif you're visiting\nanywhere in the Bay Area,\ndo not leave anything in your car\nbecause the window will get broken into,\nsometimes in broad daylight.\nSome good friends of mine\nwere visiting the Bay Area\nand I texted them and said,\nhey, by the way, when you're\nheaded to dinner, guys,\nmake sure you bring in all\nyour luggage and computers\nhowever inconvenient that might be.\nThey wrote back, too late,\neverything got stolen.\nSo some years ago now, I\nthink five, six years ago\nthis happened, sadly,\neverything got stolen.\nMost of it could be replaced,\nbut some of it was very\nsentimental to them.\nEvery time we talk, every time we consider\nhaving a meeting in a particular city,\nthis comes up as I don't want to be there,\nI don't like that city anymore, et cetera.\nAnd of course, San\nFrancisco has some wonderful\nredeeming features, but it\nonly takes one bad incident\nin one location to kind of color\nthe whole picture dark, so to speak.\nThe brain works that way.\nThe brain generalizes, it's\nnot a very specific organ,\nagain, it's a prediction machine\nin addition to other things.\nSo in the case of CBT therapy,\nthe reason there's homework\nis that when people go home,\noftentimes that's when they relapse,\nif you want to call it that,\nback into their obsessions\nand compulsions.\nAnd that location, that conditioned place\nis where it becomes most\nimportant to challenge\nthe anxiety and to deal with the anxiety,\nto not try and suppress the anxiety\nthrough compulsions or other means.\nAnd when I say other means, I\nwant to highlight something,\nit will come up again a little\nbit later in the podcast,\nthat substance abuse is very\ncommon in people with OCD\nbecause of the anxiety component\nand also because of people's feelings\nthat they just can't\nescape from the thoughts\nor behavioral patterns that\nare so characteristic of OCD.\nSo alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse,\nor other forms of narcotics abuse\nare very common in OCD.\nLater, we'll talk about\nwhether or not cannabis\ncan or cannot help with OCD.\nBut needless to say,\nsuppressing anxiety is\nexactly the wrong direction\nthat one should take if\nthe goal is to ultimately\nrelieve or eliminate the OCD.\nSo we now have two characteristics\nof CBT exposure therapy\nthat are extremely important for OCD\nand somewhat unique to\nthe treatment of OCD\nand that's the staircasing up\ntowards the really bad fear,\nthe really severe and\nspecific articulation\nand understanding and\nfeeling of how bad things\nreally would be if someone engaged\nin a particular behavior or\navoided a particular behavior.\nThen there's the component of homework\ngiven by the clinician for\nthe person to be able to\ncreate a broader set of context\nin which they can deal with the anxiety,\nnot engage in the compulsions.\nAnd then a very unique\nfeature of treatment of OCD\nthat you don't see in many\nother psychiatric disorders\nare home visits.\nAnd I find this fascinating.\nI think that the field of\npsychiatry and psychology\ntraditionally doesn't allow\nfor or invite home visits,\nbut this component of\ncontext, location and context\nbeing so vital to the\ntreatment and relief of OCD\nhas inspired many\npsychiatrists and psychologists\nto get permission to do home visits\nwhere they actually go\nvisit their patients\nin their native setting,\nin their home cages, right?\nThey're not mice, but in\ntheir home-home cages,\nI'm being facetious here, but people,\nmice live in cages, at\nleast in the laboratory,\nand humans generally live\nin houses or elsewhere,\nso they visit them in their home\nin order to see how they're interacting\nand the particular locations that evoke\nthe most anxiety and the least anxiety.\nSome of the, I don't want\nto call them crutches,\nbut some of the tools\nthat people are using\nto confront and deal with the\nobsessions and compulsions\nand in particular to try and identify\nsome of the tools and tricks\nthat people are using to try and avoid\nthat heightened anxiety,\nbecause, once again,\nand I know I'm repeating myself,\nbut I think this is just\nso vital and so unique\nabout OCD and the treatment of OCD,\nthe critical need for the\npatient to be able to tolerate\nextremely elevated levels\nof anxiety is so crucial.\nSo if people are avoiding\ncertain rooms in the house,\nor if people are avoiding certain foods\nor certain locations in the kitchen,\nthe clinician can start to identify that\nby mere observation.\nAnd I should mention here that patients\nare not always aware of\nhow they're interacting\nwith their home environment.\nSome of these patterns are\nso deeply ingrained in people\nthat they don't even realize that they're\nconstantly turning to the left,\nor they don't even realize that\nthey're only washing their\nhands on one side of the sink.\nAnd so the clinician,\nby visiting the home,\ncan start to interrogate\na bit in a polite way,\nin a friendly, in a supportive way\nas to, do you ever think\nabout why you always\nflip the faucet to the left\nor flip the faucet to\nthe right, et cetera.\nNow, we all do a lot of\nthings that are habitual.\nWe all do things that are\nsomewhat regular from day to day.\nIn fact, I would invite\nyou to ask yourself,\ndo you always put your\ntoothbrush in the same location?\nDo you always cap the toothbrush\nbefore or after you use it?\nWhat sorts of things do you-\nYou wipe the little threading\non the toothpaste or not?\nI'm somebody, I confess that I have,\nwell, I have about 3,500 pet peeves,\nbut one of my pet peeves\nis toothpaste kind of on the\nthread of the toothpaste.\nIt really bothers me, I don't know why,\nalmost as much as trying\nto wipe it off bothers me,\nwhich creates a certain challenge.\nAnd if I talk about this any further,\nthen I think I would qualify\nfor obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nBut I have to say, I don't experience\na ton of anxiety about it.\nIt doesn't govern my life.\nIn fact, I realize that right now\nthere are tubes of toothpaste\nthat have toothpaste along the thread\neverywhere in the world\nand it doesn't really bother me.\nI can still sit here and\nprovide some information\nabout OCD to you.\nIt's not intrusive, at\nleast not to my awareness.\nSo by the home visit,\nthe therapist can really start to explore\nthrough direct questioning\nand can allow the patient\nto explore through direct\nquestioning of themselves\nthe things that they might be conscious of\nand the things that they\nmight not be conscious of\nthat would qualify for OCD.\nSo I'd like to just briefly\nsummarize the key elements\nof cognitive behavioral\ntherapy and exposure therapy\nand how they can be combined\nwith drug treatments\nthat are very effective.\nMuch of what I'm going to talk about next\nrelates to the data\nand indeed the practice\nof an incredible research\nscientist and clinician.\nSo this is Helen Blair Simpson,\nor I should say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson,\nbecause she is indeed an MD medical doctor\nand a PhD research scientist\nat Columbia University School of Medicine.\nAnd one of the world's foremost experts,\nif not the expert, I would\nput her in a category\nof maybe just one to three people who\nis most knowledgeable about\nthe mechanisms of OCD,\nis actively researching OCD in humans,\ntrying to find new treatments,\ntrying to unveil new mechanisms\nand expand on our current\nunderstanding and who also treats\nOCD quite actively in her own clinic.\nDr. Simpson gave a beautiful presentation\nwhich she summarized\nsome of the core elements\nof CBT and exposure therapy\nfor the treatment of\nobsessive-compulsive disorders.\nShe describes that the key\nprocedures are exposures,\nof course, done in person\nand with the actual thing that evokes\nthe obsessions and compulsions.\nSo this could be the sweaty\ntowel as described earlier,\nor could be any number of\ndifferent triggers done\nwith the patient in real time,\nso in vivo, as we say.\nAnd it could also be\nthings that are imaginal,\nsitting somebody down in a chair,\nin an office and saying,\nokay, I want you to imagine the thing\nthat triggers the intrusive thought,\nor let's just focus on the\nintrusive thought as it arises,\nand then to explore and expose the patient\nto their obsessions and\ncompulsions that way.\nSo it can be real, or it can be imaginal.\nAnd the goal, of course, then\nis to gradually and progressively\nincrease the level of anxiety,\nbut then to intervene in\nso-called ritual prevention\nto prevent the person from\nengaging in the compulsion.\nThe goals, again I'm paraphrasing here,\nare to, as she states, disconfirm fears\nand challenge the beliefs\nabout the obsessions\nand compulsions, to\nintervene in the thoughts\nand the behaviors, and to break the habit\nof ritualizing and avoiding.\nNow, how is this typically done?\nWhat are the nuts and\nbolts of this procedure?\nTypically, this is done\nthrough two planning sessions\nwith the patient.\nSo describing to the\npatient what will happen\nand when it will happen\nand how long it will happen\nso that they're not just thrown into this\nout of the blue.\nAnd then 15 exposure sessions\ndone twice a week or more.\nSo the one thing to really understand\nabout cognitive behavioral therapy\nis that it can take some period of time,\nseveral or more weeks, as\nmany as 10 or 12 weeks.\nHowever, as you'll soon learn,\nmany of the drug treatments\nthat are effective\nin treating OCD either\nalone or in combination\nwith behavioral therapies\nalso can take 8, 10, 12 weeks\nor longer, and many of\nthose never work at all.\nSo even though 10 to 12 weeks\nseems like a long period of time,\nit's actually a pretty standard.\nIf you'd like to see\nmore complete description\nof the protocols for\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nand exposure therapy for OCD,\nI'll provide links to two papers,\nKozak and Foa, F-O-A,\nwhich is published in 1997,\nwhich might seem like a long time ago,\nbut nonetheless, that the\nprotocols are still very useful.\nAnd then the second paper\nis by that last author,\nFOA et al in 2012\nand we'll provide links to both of those.\nIn addition, Dr. Blair Simpson and others\nhave explored what are the best treatments\nfor patients with OCD by comparing\ncognitive behavioral\ntherapy alone, placebo,\nso essentially no intervention\nor something that takes an\nequivalent amount of time\nbut is not thought to be\neffective in treatment.\nAs well as selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors.\nSo what is an SSRI?\nAn SSRI is a drug that\nprevents the re-uptake\nof serotonin at the synapse.\nWhat are synapses?\nThey're the little spaces between neurons\nwhere neurons communicate with one another\nby vomiting little bits of\nchemical into the space,\nthe synapse, and then those\nchemicals either evoke\nor suppress the electrical activity\nof the next neuron across the synapse.\nAnd in this case, the neurotransmitter,\nthe chemical that we're\nreferring to is serotonin.\nSSRI, selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors\nprevent the reuptake of\nthe chemical that's left,\nin this case, the serotonin\nthat's left in the synapse.\nAfter that, I call it\nvomiting to be dramatic,\nbut it's not actually vomiting,\nthe extrusion of the\nchemical into the synapse.\nAnd as a consequence,\nthere's more serotonin around\nto have more of an effect over time,\nthe net effect being more\nserotonergic transmission,\nmore serotonin overall.\nSo not more serotonin being made,\nmore serotonin being available for use,\nthat's what an SSRI does.\nSo they compared cognitive\nbehavioral therapy, SSRIs,\nthey also had the placebo group\nand they had cognitive behavioral therapy\nplus the selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor.\nThis was a 12-week study\ndone as described before,\ntwo times a week over\nthe course of 12 weeks.\nFirst of all, the most\nimportant thing, of course,\nplacebo did nothing.\nIt did not relieve the OCD\nto any significant degree.\nHow did they know that?\nThey gave them the Y-BOCS test\nthat we talked about\nbefore, the Yale-Brown test\nwith all those questions\nof which I read a few.\nSo the OCD severity that one has to have\non the Y-BOCS is measured\nin terms of an index\nthat goes from here from\n8 all the way up to 28,\nthat shouldn't mean anything.\nSo that number eight is\nkind of meaningless here.\nIt's in terms of an index\nthat's only meaningful\nfor the Y-BOCS, but if\nsomebody has a threshold\nof 16 or higher, it means\nthat they're still having\nsomewhat debilitating symptoms\nor very debilitating symptoms.\nPlacebo did not reduce the\nobsessions or compulsions\nto any significant degree.\nHowever, and I think quite excitingly,\ncognitive behavioral\ntherapy had a dramatic\neffect in reducing the\nobsessions and compulsions\nsuch that by four weeks, that\nscore that, in this case,\nranged from 8 to 28,\ndropped all the way from\n25 down to about 11.\nSo it's a huge drop in the\nseverity of the symptoms.\nNow, what's really interesting\nis that when you look\nat the effects of SSRIs\nin the treatment of OCD symptoms,\nthey had a significant effect\nin reducing the symptoms\nof OCD that showed up first at four weeks,\nand then continued to eight weeks.\nIn fact, there was a progressive\nand further reduction\nin OCD symptoms from the\nfour to eight week period.\nAgain, these are the people\njust taking the SSRI,\nand then it sort of\nflattened out a little bit,\nsuch that by 12 weeks,\nthere was still a significant\nreduction in OCD symptoms\nfor people taking SSRIs\nas compared to placebo.\nBut the severity of their symptoms\nwas still much greater than those\nreceiving cognitive\nbehavioral therapy alone.\nSo at least in this study,\nand I should tell you which study it is,\nthis is Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005\nin the American Journal of Psychiatry,\nwe'll also provide a link to this\nso you can peruse the data if you like.\nBut at least in this study,\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nwas the most effective,\nselective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors, less effective.\nSo what happens when you combine them?\nWell, they explored that as well,\nand the combination of\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nand the SSRIs together\ndid not lead to any further\ndecrease in OCD symptoms.\nThis points to the idea that\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nis the most effective treatment.\nAnd again, when I say\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\nnow I'm still referring\nto cognitive behavioral,\nslash, exposure therapy done in the way\nthat I detailed before,\ntwice a week for 12 weeks or more.\nSo all of the data, at\nleast in this study,\npoint to the fact that\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nis really effective\nand the most effective.\nDoes it alleviate OCD\nsymptoms for everybody?\nNo.\nIs it very time consuming? Yes.\nTwice a week for two sessions\nor more of 15 minutes,\nsometimes in the office,\nplus there's homework,\nplus, in an ideal case,\nthere's also home visits\nfrom the psychiatrist or psychologist,\nthat's a lot of investment,\na lot of time investment,\nto say nothing of the\npotential financial investment.\nNow, Dr. Blair Simpson has\ngiven some beautiful talks\nwhere she describes these data\nand also emphasizes the fact that\ndespite the demonstrated power\nof cognitive behavioral therapy\nfor the treatment of OCD,\nmost people are given drug treatments\nsimply because of the availability\nof those drug treatments.\nNow, when I say most people,\nI want to emphasize that I'm referring\nto most people who\nactually go seek treatment\nbecause a really\nimportant thing to realize\nis that most people with OCD\ndo not actually go seek\nevidence-based treatment.\nI want to repeat that,\nmost people with OCD\ndo not seek evidence-based treatment,\nwhich is a tragic thing.\nOne of the motivations for\ndoing this podcast episode\nis to try and encourage people\nwho think they may have\npersistent obsessions\nand compulsions to seek treatment,\nbut most people don't\nfor a variety of reasons\nwe spelled out earlier, shame, et cetera.\nOf those that do, the first line of attack\nis typically a prescription,\nmost often an SSRI,\nalthough not always just SSRIs\nbecause soon we'll talk\nabout the somewhat common use\nof also prescribing a\nlow dose of a neuroleptic\nor an antipsychotic, not always but often.\nSo the important thing to understand here\nis that excellent\nresearchers like Dr. Simpson\nunderstand that while there are treatments\nthat we could say are best or are ideal\nbased on the data, that\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nthat's what's being deployed\nmost often in the general public.\nAs a consequence, Dr. Simpson and others\nhave explored in a very practical way\nwhether or not it matters if somebody\nis getting SSRI treatment\nand is experiencing that\nreduction in OCD symptoms\nthat as you may recall, is more than\nwhat they would experience\nwith placebo alone,\nbut not as dramatic a\nreduction in OCD symptoms\nas they would get with\ncognitive behavioral therapy.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nthere was this exploration\nof combining drug treatment\nwith cognitive behavioral\ntherapy from the outset,\nbut they also quite impressively explored\nwhat happens when people\nwho are already taking SSRIs\ninitiate cognitive behavioral therapy.\nThis is a really wonderful thing\nthat they've done this\nbecause in doing that,\nfirst of all, they're acknowledging that\nthere are many people out\nthere who have sought treatment\nand are getting some\nrelief from those SSRIs,\nbut it perhaps is not as much\nrelief as they could get.\nAnd they are actively\nacknowledging that many people\nare getting these drug treatments first.\nIn fact, most often people are getting\nthese drug treatments first.\nSo what happens when you add in\ncognitive behavioral therapy?\nWell, the good news is when you add\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nto someone who's already taking SSRIs,\nthat further improves their symptoms.\nNow that's different than the results\nthat I described before\nfrom the same laboratory in fact,\nthat if you combine\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nwith SSRIs from the outset,\nthere's no additional benefit of SSRI.\nHowever, as I just described,\nif someone is already taking an SSRI\nand they're experiencing a\nreduction in their OCD symptoms,\nby adding in cognitive behavioral therapy,\nthere is a further reduction\nin the symptoms of OCD.\nThis is very important.\nSo for those of you that\nhave sought treatment\nand you're taking a SSRI,\nor if you're thinking about treatment\nand you're prescribed an SSRI,\nthe ideal scenario really would be\nto combine the drug treatment\nwith cognitive behavioral therapy,\nor in some cases, maybe cognitive\nbehavioral therapy alone,\nalthough that's a decision\nthat you really have to make\nwith the close\nadvice and oversight of\na licensed physician,\nbecause, of course, these\nare prescription drugs.\nAnd anytime you're going to add or remove\na prescription drug or change dosage,\nyou really want to do that\nin close discussion with\nand on the advice of your physician.\nI don't just say that to protect me,\nI say that to protect you\n'cause it's just the right thing to do.\nSo again, cognitive behavioral therapy\nis extremely powerful.\nDrug treatments seem less powerful though.\nIf you're already on a drug treatment,\nadding cognitive behavioral\ntherapy can really help.\nSo I've been talking about SSRIs\nand described a little\nbit about how they work\nat a kind of superficial level of\nkeeping more serotonin in the synapse\nso that more serotonin can be in action\nas opposed to gobbled\nback up by those neurons.\nI should just mention what some\nof the selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors are.\nSo things like clomipramine,\nwhich is not entirely selective,\nI should say that that one generally falls\ninto a category of less selective.\nSo it can impair\nor can enhance some of\nthe other neurotransmitter\nor neuromodulator systems\nlike epinephrine, et cetera.\nThe selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors are,\nat least the classic ones\nare, fluoxetine, Prozac,\nfluvoxamine, Luvox,\nparoxetine, sertraline,\ncitalopram, et cetera, et cetera.\nThere are about six or classic SSRIs,\nsome of them like citalopram\nare used in children and are available\nin pediatric doses.\nSome like Prozac may or may\nnot be used in children.\nThe details of which SSRIs, et cetera,\nis a very extensive\nliterature and discussion.\nAnd I think it's safe to say that\nwhich drugs to use and which dosage\nand whether or not to continue, excuse me,\nthe same dosage over time depends a lot\non the individual variation\nthat people express\nand the responses that they have.\nAll of these drugs, in\nfact, I think we can say\nall drugs have side effects.\nThe question is how detrimental\nthose side effects are\nto daily life.\nThe SSRIs are well known to\nhave effects on appetite.\nIn some cases, they abolish appetite.\nIn some cases, they just\nreduce it a little bit.\nIn some cases, they increase appetite.\nReally is highly individual.\nThey can have effects on libido.\nFor instance, they can reduce sex drive,\nsometimes in a dose dependent way,\nsometimes in a way that's\nmore like a step function\nwhere people are fine at\nsay 5 or 10 milligrams,\nbut then they get to 15 milligrams\nand there's a cliff for their libido.\nThat can happen, it really depends.\nPlease don't take those\ndosages as exact values\n'cause this is going to depend on\nwhat they're being used for,\ndepression or anxiety or OCD,\nand it's also going to depend\non the drug, et cetera.\nI just threw out those numbers as a way\nto illustrate what a\nkind of a step function\nwould look like.\nIt's not gradual, it's\nimmediate at a given dose\nis what that means.\nThe other thing is that\nsome of these drugs\nwill have transient effects.\nSo side effects that show\nup and then disappear\nor sadly people will\nsometimes take these drugs\nfor a while and then side\neffects will surface later\nthat weren't there previously\ndepending on life factors,\nnutrition factors.\nSo it's a very complicated\nlandscape overall.\nAnd that's why it's really\nimportant to explore\nany kind of drug treatment,\nSSRI or otherwise,\nreally in close communication\nwith a psychiatrist\nwho really understands\nthe pharmacokinetics\nand has a lot of patient history\nand experience with them.\nSo what I'm about to tell you next\nis most certainly going\nto come as a big surprise,\nwhich is that despite the fact\nthat the selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors\ncan be effective in reducing\nthe symptoms of OCD,\nat least somewhat,\nand certainly more than placebo,\nthere is very little, if any evidence,\nthat the serotonin system\nis disrupted in OCD.\nAnd I have to point out that this is\na somewhat consistent theme\nin the field of psychiatry,\nthat is a given drug can be very effective\nor even partially effective\nin reducing symptoms\nor in changing the overall landscape\nof a psychiatric disorder or illness,\nand yet there is very little,\nif any evidence, that\nthat particular system\nis what's causal for OCD, or anxiety,\nor depression, et cetera.\nThis is just the landscape\nthat we're living in\nin terms of our understanding of the brain\nand psychiatry and the ways\nof treating brain disorders.\nSo as a consequence,\nthere are a huge number\nof academic reviews that\nclinicians and research scientists\nhave generated and read and share.\nOne of the more, I think, thorough ones\nin recent years was published in 2021.\nI'll provide a link to this.\nThis is by an excellent,\ntruly excellent researcher\nfrom Yale university School of Medicine,\nI should say not just a researcher\nbut a clinician scientist,\nagain, an MD-PhD.\nThis is Christopher Pittenger\nAnd the title of the review\nis Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies\nand New Targets in OCD.\nAnd again, we'll provide a link to it.\nThis is a just gorgeous review describing,\nas I just told you, that\nthe serotonin system\nisn't really disrupted in OCD\nand yet SSRIs can be very effective.\nThe review goes on to explore\neven what sorts of receptors\nfor serotonin might be involved.\nIf it's in fact the case that serotonin\nis a culprit in the\ncreation of OCD symptoms.\nTalk about the serotonin 2A receptor\nand the serotonin 1A receptor.\nWhy am I mentioning all that detail?\nIf in fact it's not clear,\nserotonin is involved because\nI'll just tell you right now,\nthere is currently a lot of interest\nin whether or not some\nof the psychedelics,\nin particular psilocybin, can be effective\nin the treatment of OCD.\nPsilocybin has been shown\nin various clinical trials\nin particular the clinical trials done\nat Johns Hopkins School of Medicine\nby Matthew Johnson and others.\nMatthew was on The Huberman Lab Podcast.\nHe's been on the Tim Ferris podcast.\nHe's been on the Lex Fridman podcast.\nHe's a world class researcher\non the use of psychedelics for depression\nand other psychiatric challenges.\nAnd their psilocybin treatment\nhas been seen, at least in those trials,\nto be very effective in the treatment\nof certain kinds of major depression.\nCurrently the exploration of psilocybin\nfor the treatment of OCD\nhas not yielded similar results,\nalthough the studies are ongoing.\nAgain, has not yielded\nsimilar effectiveness,\nbut the studies are ongoing\nAnd the serotonin 2A receptor\nand the serotonin 1A receptors\nare primary targets for\nthe drug psilocybin.\nSo I figured there were\ngoing to be some questions\nabout whether or not\npsychedelics help with OCD,\nthus far it's inconclusive.\nIf any of you have been\npart of clinical trials\nor have knowledge or intuition\nabout this relationship\nor potential relationship, I should say,\nbetween psilocybin and other psychedelics\nin OCD, please put them\nin the comment section.\nWe'd love to love to hear from you.\nOne thing I should point out\nis that even though serotonin\nhas not been directly implicated in OCD,\nserotonin and the general\nsystems of serotonin,\nthe circuits in the brain\nthat carry serotonin\nand depend on it have been shown\nto impact cognitive\nflexibility and inflexibility,\nwhich are kind of hallmark themes of OCD.\nSo in animals that have\ntheir serotonin depleted\nor in humans that have very\nlow levels of serotonin,\nyou can see evidence of\ncognitive inflexibility,\nchallenges in tasks, switching challenges\nand switching the rules by\nwhich one performs a game,\nchallenges in any kind of\ncognitive domain switching.\nAnd so that does indirectly implicate\nserotonin in some of the aspects of OCD.\nAgain, when one starts to explore\nthe different transmitter systems\nthat have been explored in\nanimal models and in humans,\nit's a vast, vast landscape,\nbut serotonergic drugs do seem to be\nthe most effective drugs in treating OCD\ndespite the fact, again, despite the fact\nthat there's no direct evidence\nthat serotonin systems\nare the problem in OCD.\nIf you recall the\ncortico-striatal-thalamic loop\nthat is so central to the etiology,\nthe presence and the\npatterns of symptoms in OCD,\nof course, serotonin is\nimpacting that system.\nSerotonin is impacting just\nabout every system in the brain,\nbut there's no evidence that\ntinkering with serotonin levels,\nspecifically in that network,\nis what's leading to\nthe improvements in OCD.\nHowever, if people go into a FMRI scanner\nand those people have OCD\nand they evoke the\nobsessions and compulsions,\nyou see activity in that\ncortico-striatal-thalamic loop.\nTreatments like SSRIs that\nreduce the symptoms of OCD\nequate to a situation where\nthere is less activity\nin that loop.\nAnd I should point out\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\nwhich we have no reason to believe\nonly taps into the serotonin system,\nI think it would be extreme stretch,\nit would be false actually to say\nthat that cognitive\nbehavioral therapy taps\nonly into the serotonin system,\nclearly it's going to affect\na huge number of circuits\nin neurochemical systems.\nWell, people who do\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nand find some relief for OCD,\nthey also show reductions\nin those cortico-striatal-thalamic loops.\nSo basically we have a situation\nwhere we have a behavioral\ntherapy that works,\nin many people, not all,\nand we have a pretty good understanding\nof about why it works.\nIt increases anxiety tolerance,\nand interference with pattern execution,\ngetting people to not engage\nin the same sorts of behaviors\nthat are detrimental to them.\nAnd we have drug treatments that work\nat least to some degree,\nbut we don't know how they work\nor where they work in the brain.\nOne of the things that really unifies\nthe behavioral treatments\nand the drug treatments\nis that they take some period of time.\nSome relief from symptoms seems to show up\naround four weeks and\ncertainly by eight weeks\nfor both cognitive behavioral\ntherapy and the SSRIs,\nbut it's really at the 10 to 12 week stage\nwhen someone's been\ndoing these twice a week,\ncognitive behavioral sessions,\nwhere they've been taking\na SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks,\nthat the really significant reduction\nin OCD symptoms starts to really show up.\nNow, up until now, I've\nbeen talking about the fact\nthat people are getting\nrelief from these treatments,\nbut sadly,\nin the case of OCD,\nthere is a significant population\nthat simply does not respond to CBT\nor to SSRIs, or to their combination,\nwhich is why psychiatrists\nalso explore the combination\nof SSRIs and neuroleptics\nor drugs that tap into the\nso-called dopamine system\nor the glutamate system.\nThese are other neurotransmitters\nand neuromodulators\nthat impact different\ncircuits in the brain.\nAnd just to really remind you\nwhat neurotransmitters\nand neuromodulators do,\nbecause this is important\nto contextualize all this,\nneurotransmitters are\ntypically involved in the\nrapid communication between neurons.\nAnd the two most common\nneurotransmitters for that\nare the neurotransmitter glutamate,\nwhich we say is excitatory,\nmeaning when it's\nreleased into the synapse,\nit causes the next neuron to\nbe more active, or active,\nand GABA which is a neurotransmitter\nthat is inhibitory,\nmeaning when it's released\ninto the synapse, typically, not always,\nbut typically, that GABA\nis going to encourage\nthe next neuron to be\nless electrically active\nor even silence its activity.\nThe neuromodulators, by contrast,\nSo not neurotransmitters,\nbut neuromodulators\nlike dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,\nand acetylcholine and others\noperate a little bit differently.\nThey tend to act a\nlittle bit more broadly.\nThey can act within the synapse,\nbut they can also change\nthe general patterns\nof activity in the brain,\nmaking certain circuits more likely\nto be active and other circuits\nless likely to be active.\nSo when we say dopamine does X\nor dopamine does Y, or serotonin does X\nor serotonin does Y,\nthey don't really do one thing,\nthey change the sort of overall tonality.\nThey make it more likely or less likely\nthat certain circuits will be active.\nYou can think of them as\nkind of activating playlists\nor genres of activity in the brain,\nrather than being involved\nin the specific communication\nor specific songs, if you will,\nin this analogy, or discussions\nbetween particular neurons.\nSo when we hear that\nSSRIs increase serotonin\nand reduce the symptoms of OCD,\nor a neuroleptic reduces\nthe amount of dopamine\nand makes people feel calmer for instance,\nor can remove some stereotype,\nrepetitive motor behavior,\nwhich they can either generate\nor reduce motor behavior it turns out.\nSo when I say that, what I'm referring to\nis the fact that these neuromodulators\nare kind of turning up the\nvolume on certain circuits\nand turning down the\nvolume on other circuits.\nI say that because if\nyou are going to explore\ndrug treatments again\nwith a licensed physician,\nif you're going to explore\ndrug treatments for OCD,\nand in particular, if you\nare not getting results\nfrom SSRIs, or you're not getting results\nfrom cognitive behavioral therapy\nor the side effect profiles of the drugs\nthat you're taking for OCD\nare causing problems that\nyou don't want to take them,\nwell, then it's important to understand\nthat anytime you take one of these drugs,\nthey're not acting specifically\non the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit.\nThat would be wonderful.\nThat's the future of psychiatry,\nbut as now, when you take a drug,\nit acts systemically.\nSo it's impacting serotonin in your gut.\nIt's also impacting serotonin\nin other areas of the brain,\nhence the effects on things\nlike digestion or libido or\nany number of different things\nthat serotonin is involved in.\nLikewise, if you take a\nneuroleptic like haloperidol\nor something that reduces\ndopamine transmission,\nwell, then it's going to\nhave some motor effects\n'cause dopamine is\ninvolved in the generation\nof motor sequences and\nsmooth limb movement.\nThat's why people with Parkinson's\nwho don't have much dopamine\nwill get a resting tremor,\nhave a hard time\ngenerating smooth movement.\nAnd so the side effects\nstart to make sense,\ngiven the huge number of\ndifferent neural circuits\nthat these different\nneuromodulators are involved in.\nI don't say that to be discouraging,\nI say that to encourage patients\nand careful systematic exploration\nof different drug treatments for OCD\nalways again with the careful and close\nguidance and oversight of a psychiatrist\nbecause psychiatrists really understand\nwhich side effect profiles make it likely\nthat you can or cannot or will never,\nor maybe someday will be\nable to take a given drug\nat a given dose.\nThey're the ones that\nreally have that knowledge.\nThis is not the sort\nof thing that you want\nto cowboy and go try\nand figure out yourself.\nNow, I also want to acknowledge\nthat there are other\nforms of drug treatments.\nWe touched on psilocybin briefly,\nbut there are other\nforms of drug treatments\nthat have been explored for OCD.\nEarlier, we talked a\nlittle bit about cannabis.\nWhy would cannabis be a\nplace of exploration at all?\nWell, first of all,\na number of people try\nand self medicate for OCD.\nThere is some clinical evidence,\nI'm not talking about recreational use,\nI'm talking about clinical evidence\nthat cannabis can reduce anxiety.\nNow earlier we were talking about\nnot reducing anxiety, but\nlearning anxiety tolerance\nin order to deal with and treat OCD\nin the context of cognitive\nbehavioral therapies.\nThat doesn't necessarily rule out cannabis\nas a candidate for the treatment of OCD.\nAnd in fact, this has been explored.\nA study from Dr. Blair Simpson\nherself looked at this.\nThis was a fairly small scale study.\nSo first of all, I'll give you the title.\nAnd again, we'll provide a link.\nThis is entitled, Acute\neffects of cannabinoids\non symptoms of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder:\nA human laboratory study.\nvery briefly, this was 14 adults with OCD.\nThey had prior experience with cannabis.\nThis was randomized, placebo-controlled.\nThe cannabis was smoked,\nthey had different varietals,\nas they're called.\nThey had a placebo.\nSo this is basically a condition\nin which certain subjects\nconsumed a cigarette that had 0% THC,\nothers had 7% THC,\nother groups that is, or\nsome had 0.4% CBD and THC.\nSo they looked at CBD.\nI know a lot of people out\nthere are interested in CBD.\nThis is one of the few\nstudies I could find\nwhere they explored different percentages\nof THC and CBD in these\ncannabis or marijuana\ncigarettes basically.\nThe total amount that they consumed,\nI believe, was 800 milligrams.\nThese, again, are not suggestions.\nThese are just simply\nreporting what's in this study.\nYou can, again, I'll provide a link.\nThey looked at OCD symptoms, ratings.\nThey looked at cardiovascular effects.\nThey had a large number\nof different things\nthat they explored.\nAnd I should say this\nstudy was done in 2020,\nand it was the first\nplacebo-controlled investigation\nof cannabis in adults with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nPretty interesting.\nAnd I'm just reading from\ntheir conclusions here.\nThe data suggests that smoked cannabis,\nwhether containing primarily THC or CBD,\nremember they looked at\ndifferent concentrations\nof those, has little acute impact,\nmeaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms\nand yield smaller reductions in anxiety\ncompared to placebo.\nSo they did not see a, when\nI say a positive effect,\nI mean a ameliorative effect,\nan effect in reducing symptoms of OCD\nfrom cannabis or CBD,\nwhich, it's unfortunate.\nI think it's unfortunate anytime\na treatment doesn't work.\nBut nonetheless, those are the data,\nI'm sure there are going\nto be other studies.\nI'm sure there are also going to be people\nin the YouTube comments section saying\nthat cannabis and CBD\nhelps their OCD symptoms,\nat least I anticipate there probably will.\nAlmost everything I say here,\nsomebody will contradict it with something\nfrom their experience, which\nI encourage, by the way.\nI want to hear about your\nexperience with certain things\neven if it's not from randomized\nplacebo-controlled studies,\nI still find it very interesting\nto know what people are doing\nand what they're experiencing.\nI think that's one of the\nbetter uses of social media\ncomment sections, is to be\nable to share some of that,\nnot in an advice-giving\nway or prescriptive way,\nbut simply as a way to share and encourage\ndifferent types of exploration.\nThere are other sorts of drug treatments\nthat are gaining popularity for OCD,\nat least in the research realm.\nOne treatment that is a legal, L-E-G-A-L.\nSometimes when I say legal,\nsometimes people think I say\nillegal, but that is legal,\nat least by prescription in\nthe United States, is ketamine.\nThe actions of ketamine\nare somewhat complex\nalthough we know, for instance,\nthat ketamine acts on\nthe glutamate system,\nit tends to disrupt the transmission\nor the relationship, I should say,\nbetween glutamate, not glutamine,\nnot the amino acid, but\nglutamate, the neurotransmitter,\nand the so-called NMDA, the\nN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,\nwhich is a receptor that's very special\nin the nervous system\nbecause when glutamate binds\nto the NMDA receptor, it tends to\noffer the opportunity for\nthat particular synapse\nto get stronger, so-called neuroplasticity\nand ketamine is a,\nessentially, an antagonist,\nalthough it works through\na complicated mechanism,\nit tends to block that\nbinding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor\nor the effectiveness of that.\nKetamine therapy is now\nbeing used quite extensively\nfor the treatment of\ntrauma and for depression.\nIt leads to a dissociative state.\nIt's a so-called dissociative analgesic\nin the variety of ways\nin which that happens.\nWe did an episode on depression.\nWe're going to do another entire\nepisode all about ketamine\ndescribing the networks that\nketamine impacts, et cetera.\nKetamine therapies are\nbeing explored for OCD.\nAs of now, the data\nlook somewhat promising,\nbut there's still a lot more\nwork that needs to be done.\nMy read of the data are that\nthe more extensive clinical trials\nhave not happened yet.\nThe smaller studies that have happened\nrevealed that some\npatients do get some relief\nfrom ketamine therapy for OCD,\nbut there was nothing\noverwhelmingly pointing to the fact\nthat ketamine is a magic\nbullet for OCD treatment.\nSo cannabis, CBD, at least now,\neven though it's one smaller study,\nthere's no real evidence that it can\nalleviate OCD symptoms.\nIf there are new studies published soon,\nI'll be sure to update you.\nAnd if you see those studies,\nplease send them to me.\nKetamine therapy, the jury is still out,\npsilocybin, The jury is still out.\nThese are early days.\nAnother treatment that's\nbecoming somewhat common,\nor at least people are\ncommonly excited about\nis transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nSo this is the use of a magnetic coil.\nThis is completely noninvasive,\nplaced on one portion of the skull,\nand one can direct magnetic\nenergy toward particular\nareas of the brain\nto either suppress, or nowadays,\nyou can also activate\nparticular brain regions.\nThere are some interesting data\nshowing that if TMS is applied\nto areas of the brain involved\nin the generation of motor action,\nso the so-called motor areas,\nor supplementary motor\nareas as they're called,\nwhile people think about\nor have intrusive thoughts,\nwe know that the TMS coil can interrupt\nthe motor behaviors, the\ncompulsive behaviors,\nand at least in a small cohort of studies\nand a small number of\npatients within those studies,\nthis has been shown to be effective,\nnot just while the coil\nis on the head, of course,\nbut after the study has been performed\nor the treatment's been performed\nin reducing OCD symptoms\nby disrupting the tendency\nfor the compulsive behavior\nto be so automatic.\nOne of the key features of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nis that, especially if it's\nbeen around for a while,\nthe person's been dealing\nwith it for a while,\nthere isn't a pattern in\nwhich the person thinks,\noh, I have this contamination fear,\nor I need symmetry, or\nI'm kind of obsessed\nto count to the number seven.\nAnd then they pause and they go,\nooh, and then they do it.\nNo, typically there's a very close\npairing of the obsession\nand the compulsion in time\nso that somebody's\nwalking down the street,\nthinking one, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven,\none, two, three, four,\nfive, six seven, seven...\nand then they're doing this\nin such rapid succession\nbecause the obsessions\nare coming up so quickly.\nThoughts can be generated very quickly.\nAnd then they're\ngenerating the compulsions\nas a way to beat down\nor to try and suppress that anxiety\nand then it comes right back up again\nat even stronger as I described earlier.\nSo transcranial magnetic stimulation\nseems to intervene in these\nvarious fast processes.\nRight now, I don't think it's fair to say\nthat TMS is a magic bullet either.\nI think there's a lot\nof excitement about TMS\nand in particular,\nI really want to nail this point home,\nin particular, there's excitement about\nthe combination of TMS\nwith drug treatments,\nor the combination of TMS with\ncognitive behavioral therapy.\nAnd this is a really important point,\nnot just for sake of discussion\nabout obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nbut also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia,\nany number of different\npsychiatric challenges\nand disorders in most cases\nare going to respond best\nto a combination of behavioral treatment\nthat's ongoing that\noccurs in the laboratory\nand clinical setting,\nbut also in the home setting\nwhere there's homework,\nmaybe even home visits.\nDrug treatments, often, not always,\nare a terrific augment to\nthose cognitive behavioral therapies\nor other behavioral therapies.\nAnd then now we are living in the age\nof brain-machine interface.\nYou have companies like Neuralink\nthat I think it's fair\nto say are going to enter\nthe brain machine-interface world first\nthrough the treatment\nof certain syndromes,\nmovement syndromes or\npsychiatric syndromes\nprobably before they\nstart putting electrodes\ninto the brain to\nstimulate enhanced memory\nor enhanced cognition, who knows,\nI don't know exactly what they're doing\nbehind the walls of Neuralink.\nBut I have to imagine, in fact,\nI would wager maybe not both arms,\nbut I'll wager my left arm\nthat the first set of\nFDA approved technologies\nto come out of companies like Neuralink\nare going to be those for\nthe treatment of things\nlike Parkinson's and movement disorders\nand cognitive disorders, rather than,\nshall we say, kind of recreational\ncognitive enhancement\nor things of that sort.\nSo transcranial magnetic\nstimulation is noninvasive.\nIt doesn't involve going\ndown below the skull,\ncan have some effect,\nbut most laboratories\nthat I'm aware of at\nStanford and elsewhere\nthat are exploring TMS for things like OCD\nand other types of psychiatric\nchallenges are using TMS in combination\nwith drug therapies, are using,\nin some cases, for instance,\na laboratory at Stanford, hope\nto get 'em on the podcast,\na psychiatrist, Nolan Williams,\nis exploring TMS in combination with\npsychedelic therapies, not\nnecessarily at the same time,\nbut nonetheless combining them\nor exploring how they\nimpact brain circuitry.\nSo if you have OCD, should\nyou run out and get TMS,\nor should you try ketamine therapy,\nof course, with a licensed physician?\nI think it's too early to say yes.\nI think the answer is\nwe need to wait and see.\nI think cognitive behavioral\ntherapy, the SSRIs,\nand some other drug\ntreatments like neuroleptics\ncombined with SSRIs and\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nare where the real bulk of the data are.\nI want to make one additional\npoint about cannabis CBD\nas it relates to\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nTo me, it's not at all surprising\nthat cannabis CBD did not\nimprove symptoms of OCD.\nBecause in my discussion\nwith Dr. Paul Conti\na few weeks ago,\nand I should mention, Dr. Conti\nis indeed a medical\ndoctor, a psychiatrist,\nwe were talking about\ncannabis and its various uses,\nbecause it does have some\nclinical applications.\nAnd he mentioned that\none of the main effects\nof cannabis is to tighten focus\nand to enhance concentration on\nand thoughts about one particular thing.\nAnd in some cases that can\nbe clinically beneficial,\nand in other cases that can\nbe clinically detrimental.\nIf you accept the idea that\ncannabis increases focus,\nand you think about OCD\nand the networks involved,\nand you think about the\nanxiety and the relationship\nbetween the obsession and compulsion,\nwell, then it shouldn't\ncome as any surprise\nthat cannabis did not\nimprove the symptoms of OCD\nbecause if anything,\nit would increase focus\non the obsessions and the compulsions.\nNow that's not what they observed.\nThey did not see an exacerbation\nor a worsening of the\nsymptoms of OCD with cannabis,\nat least that's not my read of the data,\nbut they did not see an improvement\nin OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD.\nAnd to me, that's not surprising\ngiven that cannabis CBD\nseems to increase focus.\nNext, I'd like to talk\nabout some of the research\non and the roles of hormones in OCD,\nbecause it turns out to be\na very interesting relationship there.\nBut before I do, I want\nto point out something\nthat I realize I probably\nshould have said earlier,\nwhich is one of the key\nthings for someone with OCD\nto come to understand if\nthey're going to experience\nany relief of their symptoms,\nwhether or not they're\ndoing drug treatments\nor behavioral treatments or otherwise,\nis that thoughts are\nnot as bad as actions.\nThoughts are not as bad as actions.\nOne of the kind of rules\nthat people with OCD\nseem to adopt for themselves\nis that thoughts are really,\ntruly the equivalent of actions.\nSo they'll have an intrusive thought and,\nwe haven't spent too\nmuch time on this today,\nbut earlier I touched on the fact\nthat some of the intrusive\nthoughts that people have\nin OCD are really disturbing.\nThey can be really gross,\nor at least gross to that person.\nThey can evoke imagery that\nis toxic or infectious,\nor is highly sexualized in a way\nthat is disturbing to\nthem, it can be very taboo.\nThis is not uncommon\nwhen you start talking to people with OCD\nand you start pulling on the thread.\nAgain, this would be a psychiatrist\nwho was trained to ask the right questions\nand gain the comfort\nand trust of a patient.\nAnd they start to reveal that\nthese thoughts are really\nintrusive and kind of disturbing,\nwhich is why they feel so compelled\nto try and suppress them with behaviors.\nOne of the powerful elements\nof treatment for OCD\nis to really support the patient\nand make them realize that\nthoughts are just thoughts\nand that everyone has disturbing thoughts.\nAnd that oftentimes\nthose disturbing thoughts\narise at the most\ninconvenient, and sometimes,\nwhat seems like the most\ninappropriate circumstances.\nAnd this relates to a\nwhole larger discussion\nthat we could have about what are thoughts\nand why do they surface,\nand how come when you stand\nat the edge of a bridge,\neven if you do not want to jump off,\nyou think about jumping off.\nAnd this has to do with the fact\nthat your nervous system,\nas a prediction machine,\nis oftentimes testing possibilities.\nAnd sometimes that testing\ngoes way off into the\nNetherlands of the thought patterns\nand emotional patterns that\nwe all have inside of us.\nThe big difference between\na thought and an action\nis that, of course, the nervous system is,\nin one case, not translating\nthose patterns of thinking\ninto motor sequences.\nThat nerdy way of saying\nthoughts aren't actions,\nbelieve it or not,\ncan be helpful for people if they really\nthink about that and\nuse it as an opportunity\nto realize that, first of\nall, they're not crazy.\nThey're not thinking\nand feeling this stuff\nbecause they're bad or evil.\nAnd of course, sometimes\nthis can cross over\nwith other elements of life\nwhere we place moral judgment on people\nfor certain behaviors.\nI think that's part of a\nhealthy society, of course,\nthat's why we have laws and punishments\nand rewards for that matter\nfor certain types of behaviors.\nBut this idea that thoughts\nare not as bad as actions\nand that thoughts can be tolerated\nand the anxiety around thoughts\ncan be tolerated and\nover time can diminish,\nthat's a very powerful hallmark theme\nof the treatment of OCD\nso I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.\nThoughts are not actions.\nActions can harm us, they\ncan harm other people,\nthey can soak up enormous amounts of time.\nThoughts can soak up\nenormous amounts of time.\nThey can be very troubling.\nThey can be very detrimental.\nWe of course want to be sensitive to that,\nbut when it really comes down to it,\nthe first step in treatment\nfor OCD is this realization\nwhere the approach to the realization\nthat thoughts are not as bad as actions.\nSo what about hormones in OCD?\nWell, this has been explored,\nalbeit not as extensively\nas I would've liked to find,\nbut when I went into the literature,\nI found one particularly\ninteresting study,\nentitled, Neurosteroid Levels in Patients\nwith Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\nFirst author, Erbay\nAnd as always, we'll\nprovide a link to the study.\nThe objective of this\nstudy was to explore serum\nwithin blood, neurosteroid\nlevels in people with OCD.\nWhy?\nWell, because of the relationship\nbetween OCD and anxiety\nand the fact that in\nstress-related disorders\nsuch as anxiety and depression,\nthe hormones have been\nextensively explored,\nbut not so much in OCD,\nat least until this study.\nSo they compared serum levels of a number\nof different hormones,\nprogesterone, pregnenolone,\nDHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.\nThis was done in 30 patients with OCD\nand 30 healthy controls.\nSo it's not a huge study,\nbut it's enough to draw\nsome pretty nice conclusions.\nThese subjects were 18 to 49 years old,\nand the controls were age and sex matched\nhealthy volunteers.\nAgain, no OCD.\nWhat was the basic\ntakeaway from the study?\nThe basic takeaway from the\nstudy was that in females\nwith OCD, there was evidence\nfor significantly elevated\ncortisol and DHEA.\nNow that's interesting because cortisol\nis well known to be associated\nwith the stress system.\nAlthough every day, should mention,\nwe all, male or female,\neverybody experiences\nan increase in cortisol\nshortly after awakening.\nThat's a healthy increase in cortisol.\nLate shift, I mean, late in\nthe day peaks in cortisol\nwhere a shift in that cortisol peak\nto later in the day is a known correlate\nof depression and anxiety disorders.\nSo the fact that cortisol is elevated\nand DHEA are elevated in female patients\nwith OCD suggests that\ncortisol is either reflective of or causal\nfor the increase in anxiety.\nWe don't know the\ndirection of that effect.\nNow in male patients with OCD,\nthere was evidence for increased cortisol.\nAgain, not surprising given the\nrole of anxiety in cortisol,\nor I should say, given the\nrole of cortisol in anxiety\nand the increasing anxiety seen in OCD,\nbut there are also significant\nreductions in testosterone,\nwhich should also not surprise us\nbecause cortisol and\ntestosterone more or less compete\nin some fashion for their own production,\nboth are derived from\nthe molecule cholesterol.\nAnd there are certain biochemical pathways\nthat can either direct\nthat cholesterol molecule\ntoward cortisol synthesis\nor testosterone synthesis,\nbut not both.\nSo they compete.\nSo when cortisol goes up in general,\nnot always, but in general,\ntestosterone goes down and vice versa.\nIf you want to learn more\nabout the relationship\nbetween cortisol and testosterone,\nand there are even some tools\nto try and optimize those\nratios in both males and females,\nyou can find that in our episode\non optimizing testosterone and estrogen,\nthat's at hubermanlab.com.\nNow, I would say the\nmost interesting aspect\nof this study is not\nthat DHEA and cortisol\nare elevated in females with OCD\nor that cortisol and testosterone\nhave this opposite effect,\ncortisol up and testosterone\ndown in males with OCD,\nbut rather the relationship\nbetween all of those,\nDHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.\nIn terms of GABA, GABA again\nbeing this inhibitory neurotransmitter\nthat tends to quiet\ncertain neuronal pathways,\nit does different things\nat different synapses,\nbut in general, the more\nGABA that's present,\nthe more inhibition that's present,\nand therefore the more\nsuppression of neural activity.\nAnd DHEA is known to\nbe a potent antagonist\nof the GABA system.\nSo here we have elevated DHEA in females.\nAnd I should also\nmention that testosterone\nis also known to tap into the GABA system.\nTypically, when testosterone is elevated,\nGABA transmission, at\nleast is slightly elevated.\nSo here we have a situation\nin which the pattern\nof hormones in females and males with OCD\nare different from those\nin people without OCD\nsuch that GABA transmission is altered\nand the net effect would be\nan overall reduction in GABA.\nNow GABA, as an inhibitory\nneurotransmitter,\nand broadly speaking is associated\nwith lower levels of anxiety,\nand it tends to create balance\nwithin various neural circuits.\nNow, that's a very broad statement,\nbut we know for instance, in epilepsy,\nthat GABA levels are reduced\nand therefore you get runaway excitation\nof certain circuits in the brain,\nand therefore seizures, either petite mal,\nmini seizures, or grand\nmal, massive seizures,\nor even drop seizures where\npeople completely collapse\nto the floor in seizure.\nYou may have seen this before.\nI certainly have, it's very dramatic\nand it actually is quite\ndebilitating for people\nbecause obviously they don't\nknow when these seizures\nare coming on most often, and then\nthey can fall into a stove\nor while driving, et cetera.\nSo the situation with OCD is one in which,\nfor whatever reason, we don't\nknow the direction of effect.\nCertain hormones are elevated in females\nand certain hormones are elevated in males\nand those hormones differ\nbetween males and females,\nand yet they both funnel into a system\nwhere GABAergic or GABA\ntransmission in the brain\nis reduced because of this ability\nfor those particular hormones\nto be antagonists to GABA,\nand as a consequence, there's\nlikely to be overall levels\nof increased excitation in\ncertain networks in the brain\nand that brings us back to this\ncortico-striatal-thalamic loop,\nthis repetitive loop\nthat seems to reinforce,\nwe can say reinforces\nobsession, leads to anxiety,\nleads to compulsion, leads to\ntransient relief of anxiety,\nbut then increase in anxiety,\nincreased obsession, anxiety,\ncompulsion, anxiety,\ncompulsion, anxiety, compulsion,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo I have not found\nstudies that have explored\nadjusting testosterone levels\nthrough exogenous administration,\ncream or injection or otherwise,\nor that have focused on\nreducing DHEA in females.\nIf anyone is aware of such studies,\nplease put them in the\ncomment section on YouTube\nor send them to us.\nWe have a contact site on the\nwebsite at hubermanlab.com,\nbut the comment section\non YouTube would be best.\nBut because we know that\nhormones impact neuromodulators\nand neurotransmitters,\nas I just described,\nand that those neuromodulators\nand neurotransmitters\nplay an intimate role in the generation\nand the treatment of things like OCD,\nit stands to reason that manipulations\nof those hormone systems, however subtle\nor dramatic might, I want to highlight,\nmight prove useful in\nadjusting the symptoms of OCD\nand I hope that this is\nan area that researchers\nare going to pursue in\nthe very near future\nbecause many of the\ntreatments for reducing DHEA\nor increasing testosterone\nor reducing cortisol\nhave already made it through FDA approval.\nThey're out there, they're\nreadily prescribed.\nMany of them are already in generic form\nwhich means that the\npatents have already lapsed\non the first versions of those drugs.\nSo when they're available as\ngeneric drugs, very often,\nthey're available at\nsignificantly lower cost.\nThere's a whole discussion we had there\nabout patent laws and prescription drugs.\nBut because these drugs\nare largely available\nin prescription yet generic form,\nI think there's a great opportunity\nto explore how hormones,\nnot just cortisol,\ntestosterone, and DHA,\nbut the huge category of hormones\nmight impact the symptoms of OCD,\nespecially since many\nof the symptoms of OCD\nshow up right around the time of puberty.\nWe haven't talked a lot\nabout childhood OCD,\n'cause we're going to do an entire series\non childhood psychiatric\ndisorders and challenges but\nmany children develop OCD early as young\nas three or four, believe it or not,\nor even 6 or 7 and 10\nand in adolescence, and\ncertainly around puberty.\nand in young adulthood.\nIt is rare, although it does happen,\nthat people will develop\nOCD very late in life\naround 40 or older, just\nkind of spontaneously.\nMost often when you look\nat their clinical history,\nyou find that either they were hiding it\nor is being suppressed in some way,\nor if it does spontaneously\nshow up late in life\nlike mid-thirties or in one's forties,\ntypically there's a\ntraumatic brain injury,\ncould be due to stroke or\nphysical injury to the head\nor something of that sort.\nNonetheless,\nthere is a interesting correlation\nbetween the onset of puberty\nin certain forms of OCD.\nThere's certain forms of, or I should say,\nthere's certain aspects of menopause\nthat can relate to OCD.\nYou can find all these\nthings in the literature.\nAll this to say that hormones\nimpact neurotransmitters\nand neuromodulators, which clearly impact\nthe kinds of circuits\nthat are involved in OCD\nand it makes sense that,\nand I would hope that there\nwould be an exploration\nof how these hormones impact OCD\nin the not too distant future.\nNow there is an extensive\nliterature exploring\nhow testosterone therapy,\nboth in males and\nfemales, can be effective\nin some cases in the treatment\nof anxiety-related disorders,\nbut not, at least to my\nknowledge, in OCD in particular.\nSo this whole area of the use\nof testosterone and estrogen therapies,\nDHEA, cortisol suppression,\nor maybe even enhancement\nfor the treatment of OCD\nis essentially a big black box\nthat very soon, I believe, will be lit.\nI realize that a number of\nlisteners of this podcast\nare probably interested in the non-typical\nor holistic treatments for OCD.\nDr. Blair Simpson's lab\nhas at least one study\nexploring the role of\nmindfulness meditation\nfor the treatment of OCD.\nThere, the data are a\nlittle bit complicated\nand I should mention that\ngood things are happening, at\nleast in the United States,\nprobably elsewhere as well,\nbut good things are happening in terms of\nthe exploration of things like meditation\nand other, let's call them non-traditional\nor holistic forms of treatment\nfor psychiatric disorders\nbecause of the division\nof complimentary health\nthat's now been launched\nby the National Institutes of Health.\nSo, whereas before\npeople would think about\nmeditation or yoga nidra,\nor even CBD supplementation\nfor that matter,\nas kind of fringe maybe, or kind of woo\nor non-traditional at the very least,\nthe National Institutes of\nHealth in the United States\nhas now devoted an entire division,\nan entire Institute,\npurely for the exploration\nof things like breathing\npractices, meditation, et cetera.\nSo there's a cancer institute,\nthere's a hearing and deafness institute,\nthere's a vision institute,\nand now there's this\ncomplimentary health Institute,\nwhich I think is a wonderful addition\nto the more traditional\naspects of medicine.\nI think no possible useful treatment\nshould be overlooked or\nunresearched in my opinion,\nprovided that can be done safely.\nAnd as I mentioned,\nDr. Blair Simpson's lab\nhas looked at the role\nof mindfulness meditation\nand the treatment of OCD.\nNow we should all keep in mind,\nno pun intended, that most of the data\non mindfulness meditation\nshows that it increases\nthe ability to focus.\nNow, this brings us back to a\nkind of repeating theme today,\nwhich is that increased focus\nmay not be the best thing\nfor somebody with OCD\nbecause it might increase\nfocus on the obsession\nand/or compulsion.\nTurns out that mindfulness\nmeditation can be useful\nin the treatment of OCD,\nbut mainly by way of how it impacts\nthe focus on and the ability\nto engage in cognitive\nbehavioral therapies.\nSo it's very unlikely, at\nleast by my read of the data,\nto be a direct effect of meditation\non relieving the symptoms,\nrather it seems that\nmeditation is increasing focus\non things like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy homework\nand to not focus on other things\nand therefore indirectly\nimproving the symptoms of OCD.\nNow somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,\nthere have also been a fairly\nlarge number of studies\nexploring how nutraceuticals,\nas they're sometimes called,\nsupplements that are\navailable over the counter\ncan impact the treatment of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nNow there's such an extensive\nnumber of different compounds\nand supplements that\nfall under the category\nof nutraceuticals and\nthat have been explored\nin the treatment of OCD\nthat I'd like to point you\nto a review that is entitled,\nNutraceuticals in the treatment\nof obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder: a review,\nexcuse me, of mechanistic\nand clinical evidence.\nSo it's published in 2011,\nso it's over 10-years-old.\nAnd so by now,\nI have to imagine that\nthere are an enormous number\nof additional substances\nthat could be explored,\nbut there are just one or two\nhere that I want to focus on.\nHere in this review,\nthey describe effects\nof 5-HTP and tryptophan,\nso things that are in\nthe serotonin pathway,\nwhich would make sense\ngiven what we know about the SSRIs\nthat people would explore\nhow different supplements\nthat increase serotonergic transmission\nmight impact OCD.\nWhat you find is that they\ndo have significant effects\nin improving or reducing\nthe symptoms of OCD\nin somewhat similar way\nto some of the SSRIs.\nBut you of course have to be careful.\nAnything that's going to tap into a given\nneurochemical system to the same degree\nmay very likely have the\nsame sorts of side effects\nthat a prescription drug would.\nOne compound that I like to focus on\nin a little more depth, however,\nbecause it's exciting\nand interesting to me\nis inositol.\nInositol is a compound that\nwe are going to talk about\nin several future podcasts, because,\nwell, first of all,\nit seems that it can\nhave impressive effects\non reducing anxiety.\nIt also can have pretty impressive effects\nin improving fertility\nand particular in women\nwith polycystic ovarian syndrome.\nAnd here I'm referring\nspecifically to myo-inositol\nbecause it comes in several forms.\nAnd it does appear that\n900 milligrams of inositol\ncan improve sleep and can reduce anxiety\nperhaps when taken at that\ndosage or higher dosages.\nI will just confess, first\nof all, I don't have OCD,\nalthough I will also confess\nthat when I was a child,\nI had a transient tick.\nI've talked about this on podcast before.\nIt was a grunting tick.\nSo when I was about six or seven,\nI recall a trip to\nWashington DC with my family,\nwhere I was feeling a strong\ndesire or need even as I recall,\nto grunt in order to clear something\nin my throat, but I didn't\nhave anything in my throat.\nI didn't have a cold\nor any postnasal drip,\nit was really just the feeling\nthat I needed to do that,\nto release some sort of tension.\nAnd I remember my dad at the time\ntelling me don't do that.\nDon't do that, it's not good to grunt\nor something like that.\nI think he saw that it was a\nkind of compulsive behavior.\nAnd so I would actually\nhide in the back seat\nof the rental car and do\nit, or I'd hide in my room.\nFortunately for me, it was transient,\nI think about six months or\na year later, it disappeared.\nAlthough I did notice, actually\nan ex-girlfriend of mine\npoint out that when I get very tired\nand I've been working very long hours,\nsometimes that grunting\ntick will reappear.\nWhat does that mean?\nDo I have Tourette's?\nI don't know, maybe.\nI was never diagnosed with Tourette's.\nDo I have OCD? Maybe.\nI certainly could be accused\nof having obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nwhich we'll talk about\nstill in a few minutes.\nBut the point here is that many children\ntransiently express ticks\nor low level Tourette's\nor OCD, and again, transiently\nand it disappears over time.\nSo inositol has been explored\nin a bunch of different contexts,\nincluding for ticks in OCD, et cetera.\nGoing back to inositol\nand its current use,\nor I should say my current use,\nI've been taking 900\nmilligrams of inositol\nas in addition to my\nexisting toolkit for sleep,\nwhich I've talked about\nmany times on this podcast\nand other podcasts, consists\nof magnesium threonate,\napigenin, and theanine.\nIf you want to know more about that kit,\nyou can go to our newsletter,\nNeural Network Newsletter\nat hubermanlab.com.\nThe toolkit for sleep is there.\nYou don't even have to\nsign up for the newsletter\nbut it'll give you a flavor\nof the sorts of things\nthat are in the newsletter.\nIn any case, I've been experimenting a bit\nwith taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol\neither alone or combination\nwith that sleep kit.\nAnd I must say the sleep I've been getting\non inositol is extremely deep\nand does seem to lead to enhanced levels\nof focus and alertness during the day.\nAnd perhaps you're noticing that\n'cause I'm talking more quickly\non this podcast than in previous podcast.\nNo, I'm just kidding.\nI don't think the two things relate\nin any kind of causal way.\nThe point here is that inositol is known\nto be pretty effective\nin reducing anxiety,\nbut when taken at very high dosages.\nCan it do the same at low dosages?\nWe don't know.\nI would consider 900\nmilligrams a low dose.\nMost of this, given the fact\nthat most of the studies of inositol\nhave explored very high dosages,\nlike even 10 or 12 grams per day,\nwhich I must say seems exceedingly high\nand they do report that\nsome of the subjects\nin those experiments actually stop taking\nthe inositol because of gastric discomfort\nor gastric distress as it's called.\nSo I've reported my results with sleep\nin a kind of anecdotal way.\nThey certainly aren't\npeer-reviewed studies\nthat I described about my own experience\nin an anecdotal way.\nBut nonetheless, it's been explored that\nthings like glycine, which is another,\nwhich is an amino acid,\nwhich also acts as an\ninhibitory neurotransmitter\nin the brain, taken at very high dosages,\n60 grams per day, that is a absolutely\nastonishingly high amount of glycine.\nI would not recommend\ntaking that much glycine\nunless you're part of a study\nwhere they tell you to\nand you know it's safe.\n18 grams, excuse me, of an inositol,\nthese are very, very high\ndosages used in these studies.\nNonetheless, there's some interesting data\nabout inositol leading to\nsome alleviation of OCD symptoms\nor partial alleviation of OCD symptoms\nin as little as two weeks after initiating\nthe supplement protocol.\nSo I think there's a great\nfuture for these nutraceuticals,\nmeaning I think more\nsystematic exploration\nin particular of lower dosages\nin the context of OCD treatment.\nAnd as we saw before for the SSRIs\nand other prescription drug treatments,\nI think there really\nneeds to be an exploration\nof these nutraceuticals in combination\nwith behavioral therapies.\nAnd who knows, maybe with\nbrain machine interface\nlike cranial magnetic stimulation as well.\nNow way back at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nI alluded to the fact\nthat OCD is one thing,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder,\nand it's truly a disorder\nand it's truly debilitating\nand it's extremely common,\nand then there's this other thing\ncalled obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nwhich is distinct from that\ndoes not have the intrusive component\nso people don't feel overwhelmed\nor overtaken by these thoughts,\nrather, they find that the obsessions\ncan sometimes serve them\nor they even welcome them.\nAnd I think many of us\nknow people like this,\nI perhaps even could be\naccused or who knows,\nmaybe have been accused of having\nan obsessive-compulsive\npersonality at times.\nWhy do I draw this distinction?\nWell, first of all, we've come\nto a point in human history,\nI think in large part\nbecause of social media\nbut also in large part\nbecause there are a number\nof discussions being held\nabout mental health that have\nbrought terms like trauma,\ndepression, OCD, et cetera,\ninto the common vernacular\nso that people will\nsay, ah, you're so OCD,\nor someone will say I\nwas traumatized by that,\nor I was traumatized by this.\nWe should be very careful, right?\nI'm certainly not the word police,\nbut we should be very careful in the use\nof certain types of language,\nespecially language that\nhas real psychiatric\nand psychological definitions\nbecause it can really draw us off course\nin providing relief for\nsome of these syndromes.\nFor instance,\nthe word trauma is thrown\naround left and right nowadays.\nI was traumatized by this,\nor that caused trauma,\nyou're giving me trauma.\nListen, I realize that many people\nare traumatized by certain events\nincluding things that are said to them,\nI absolutely acknowledge that,\nhence our episodes on\ntrauma and trauma treatment,\nseveral of them, in fact.\nDr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,\nand then dedicated solo episodes\nwith just me blabbing about\ntrauma and trauma treatment.\nBut as Dr. Conti so\nappropriately pointed out,\ntrauma is really something that changes\nour neural circuitry and\ntherefore our thoughts\nand our behaviors in a very persistent way\nthat is detrimental to us.\nNot every bad event is traumatizing,\nnot everything that we\ndislike or even that we hate\nor that feels terrible\nto us is traumatizing.\nFor something to reach\nthe level of trauma,\nit really needs to change\nour neural circuitry\nand therefore our\nthoughts and our behaviors\nin a persistent way that\nis maladaptive for us.\nSimilarly, just calling\nsomeone obsessive is one thing,\nsaying that someone has\nOCD or assuming one has OCD\nsimply because they have a\npersonality or a phenotype,\nas we say, where they need\nthings in perfect order,\nlike I find myself correcting these pens\nmaking sure that the caps are facing\nin the same direction\nfor instance right now,\nthat is not the same as OCD.\nIf, for instance, I\ncan tolerate these pens\nbeing at different orientation\nor even throw the cap on\nthe floor or something,\nit doesn't create a lot of anxiety for me.\nI confess, I agree it's a\nlittle bit in the moment,\nbut then I can forget\nabout it and move on.\nThat's one of the key distinctions\nbetween obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder\nin its strictest form.\nNow, once one hears that OCD\nis different than obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\nbecause of this difference\nin how intrusive the thoughts are or not,\nthen that's useful, but\nit really doesn't tell us\nanything about what is\nhappening mechanistically\nin one situation or another.\nFortunately, there are\nbeautiful data again\nfrom Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.\nAnd you can tell based\non the number of studies\nthat I've referred to from her laboratory,\nshe's truly one of the\nluminaries in this field,\nthat there really are some\nfundamental wiring differences\nand behavioral differences\nand psychological differences\nbetween people who have\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nand those who have obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nSo this is a study, first\nauthor, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O\nentitled, Capacity to\ndelay reward differentiates\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nand obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nAnd the methods in this\nstudy were to take 25 people\nwith OCD and 25 people\nwith obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder and 25 people\nwho have both, because it\nis possible to have both\nand that's important to point out,\nand 25 so-called healthy controls,\npeople that don't have\nobsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder or\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nThey take clinical assessments\nand then they took a number of tests\nthat probed their ability\nto defer gratification,\nsomething called, in the laboratory,\nwe call it delayed discounting.\nSo their ability to defer gratification\nthrough a task where they\ncan either accept reward\nright away or accept reward later.\nSome of you may have heard\nof the two marshmallow task.\nThis is based on a study\nthat was performed years ago\non young children at\nStanford and elsewhere\nwhere they take young\nchildren into a room,\nthey offer them a marshmallow,\nkids like marshmallows generally,\nand you say, you can eat\nthe marshmallow right now\nor you can wait some period of time,\nand if you are able to wait\nand not eat the marshmallow,\nyou can have two marshmallows.\nAnd in general, children\nwant two marshmallows\nmore than they want one marshmallow.\nSo really what you're probing is\ntheir ability to access\ndelayed gratification.\nAnd they're very entertaining,\neven truly amusing videos\nof this on the internet.\nSo if you just do two\nmarshmallow task video\nand you go into YouTube,\nwhat you'll find is that\nthe children will use\nall sorts of strategies\nto delay gratification.\nSome of the kids will\ncover the marshmallow.\nOthers will talk to the\nmarshmallow and say,\nI know you're not that delicious.\nYou look delicious, but\nno, you're not delicious.\nThey'll engage with the marshmallow\nin all sorts of cute ways.\nThey'll turn around and try\nto, you know, avoidance,\nwhich actually speaks to a\nwhole category of behaviors\nthat people with OCD also use.\nI'm not saying these kids had OCD,\nbut avoidance behaviors are\nvery much a component of OCD.\nPeople really trying to avoid the thing\nthat evokes the obsession.\nWell some kids are able\nto delay gratification,\nsome aren't and it's\ndebatable as to whether or not\nthe kids that are able\nto delay gratification\ngo on to have more\nsuccessful lives or not.\nInitially, that was the\nconclusion of those studies.\nThere's still a lot of debate about it,\nwe'll bring an expert on to\ngive us the final conclusion\non this 'cause there is one\nand it's very interesting\nand not intuitive.\nNonetheless, adults are also faced\nwith decisions every day, all day\nas to whether or not they\ncan delay gratification.\nAnd this study used a, not\na two marshmallow task,\nbut a game that involved rewards\nwhere people could delay in order\nto get greater rewards later.\nWhat is the conclusion?\nWell, first of all, obsessive-compulsive\nand obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder subjects\nboth showed impairments in\ntheir psychosocial functioning\nand quality of life.\nThey had compulsive behavior.\nSo these are people that\nare suffering in their life\nbecause their compulsions\nare really strong.\nSo it's not just being really nit-picky\nor really orderly in one case\nand having full blown OCD in the other,\nboth sets of subjects\nare challenged in life\nbecause they're having relationship issues\nor job-related issues, et cetera,\nbecause they are that compulsive.\nHowever, the individuals with\nobsessive-compulsive personality disorder,\nthey discounted the value\nof delayed gratification\nsignificantly less than those\nwith obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nWhat do I mean?\nThey are both impairing disorders\nthat are marked by compulsive behaviors,\nhere I'm paraphrasing,\nbut they can be\ndifferentiated by the presence\nof obsessions in OCD.\nSo obsessions in OCD.\nPeople with OCD are absolutely fixated\non certain ideas and\nthose ideas are intrusive.\nAgain, that's the hallmark theme.\nAnd by an excessive\ncapacity to delay reward\nin obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nThat is people who have\nobsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder are really good\nat delaying gratification.\nSo they are able to\nconcentrate very intensely\nand perform very intensely in ways\nthat allow them to instill order\nsuch that they can delay reward.\nNow you can see why this\ncontour of symptoms,\nmeaning that the people with OCD\nare experiencing intrusive thoughts,\nwhereas the people with\nobsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\nshow an enhanced ability\nto defer gratification.\nYou could see how that would lead\nto very different outcomes.\nPeople with obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\ncan actually leverage\nthat personality disorder\nto perform better in\ncertain domains of life,\nnot all domains of life,\nbecause remember, again,\nthese people are in this study\nand they're showing up as\nexperiencing challenges in life\nbecause of their obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nNonetheless, people with\nobsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder, you could imagine,\nwould be very good at say architecture\nor anything that involves\ninstilling a ton of order.\nMaybe sushi chef, for instance,\nmaybe a chef in general.\nI know chefs that just\nkind of throw things around\nlike the chef on the Muppets\nand just like throw things\neverywhere and still produce amazing food.\nAnd then there's some people\nthere incredibly exacting,\nthey're just incredibly precise.\nI think that movie, what is it?\nJiro Dreams of Sushi?\nThat movie is incredible.\nCertainly not saying he\nhas obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder, but\nI think it's fair to say\nthat he is obsessive or\nextremely meticulous and orderly\nabout everything from start to finish.\nYou can imagine a huge array\nof different occupations\nand life endeavors where\nthis would be beneficial,\nscience being one of them\nwhere data collection\nand analysis is exceedingly\nimportant that one be precise,\nor mathematics or physics or engineering,\nanything where precision has a payoff\nand gaining precision takes time and delay\nof immediate gratification,\nyou can imagine that obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder would synergize well\nwith those sorts of\nactivities and professions.\nWhereas obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder is really intrusive.\nIt's preventing functionality in many\ndifferent domains of life.\nSo the key takeaway here is that\nwhen we use the words\nobsessive-compulsive,\nor we call someone obsessive-compulsive,\nor we are trying to\nevaluate whether or not\nwe are obsessive compulsive,\nit's very important that we highlight\nthat obsessive compulsive\ndisorder is very intrusive.\nIt involves intrusive thoughts\nand it interrupts with\nnormal functioning in life.\nWhereas obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nwhile it can interrupt\nnormal functioning in life,\nit also can be productive.\nIt can enhance functioning\nin life, not just in work,\nbut perhaps at home as well.\nIf you are somebody and\nyou have family members\nthat really place enormous value on having\na beautiful and highly organized home,\nwell, then it could lend\nitself well to that.\nit's going to be a matter\nof degrees, of course.\nNone of these things is an absolute,\nit's going to be on a continuum,\nbut I think it is fair to\nsay that obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder, whether or\nnot in mild, moderate,\nor severe form is impairing\nnormal functioning,\nwhereas obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nthere's a range of expressions of that,\nsome of which can be adaptive,\nsome of which can be maladaptive,\nand again, it's all going\nto depend on context.\nBefore we conclude, I do\nwant to touch on something\nthat I think a lot of people experience\nand that's superstitions.\nSuperstitions are fascinating,\nand there's some fascinating\nresearch on superstitions.\nOne particular study that I'm a big fan of\nis the work of Bence Olveczky at Harvard.\nHe studies motor sequences\nand motor learning,\nand he has beautiful\ndata on how people learn,\nfor instance, a tennis swing\nand the patterns that\nthey engage in early on\nand then the patterns\nof swinging that they,\nswinging the racket that is,\nthat they engage in later\nas they acquire more skill.\nAnd basically the takeaway is that\nthe amount of error or\nvariation from swing to swing\nis dramatically reduced\nas they acquire skill.\nThat's all fine and good,\nand there's some\nbeautiful mechanistic data\nthat he and others have discovered\nto support how that comes to be,\nbut they also explore animal models,\nin particular, rats pressing\nsequences of buttons\nand levers to obtain a reward.\nBelieve it or not, rats are pretty smart.\nI've seen this with my own eyes.\nYou can teach a rat to press\na lever for a pellet of food.\nRats can also learn to press levers\nin a particular sequence in order to gain\na piece of food.\nAnd they can actually learn to press\nan enormous number of levers\nin very particular sequences\nin order to obtain pellets of food.\nYou can also give them\nlittle buttons to press\nor even a paddle to, or I\nshould say a pedal, excuse me,\nto stomp on with their foot\nin order to obtain a pellet of food.\nBasically rats can learn\nexactly what they need to do\nin order to obtain a piece of food,\nespecially if they're made\na little bit hungry first.\nBence's lab has published beautiful data\nshowing that as animals and humans\ncome to learn a particular motor sequence,\nvery often they will\nintroduce motor patterns\nin that sequence that are\nirrelevant to the outcome\nand yet that persist.\nIf you've ever watched a game of baseball,\nyou've seen this before.\nOftentimes the pitcher\nup on the mound will\nbring the ball to their chin.\nThey'll look over their shoulder,\nthey'll look back over the other shoulder,\nand then they will, of course,\nreel back and pitch the ball.\nBut if you watch closely,\noftentimes there are components\nin the motor sequence,\nwhich are completely\nunrelated to the pitch.\nThey're not looking necessarily to see\nif someone's stealing a base.\nThey're not necessarily looking\ndown at home plate where the batter is.\nThey're also doing things like\ntouching the back of their ear\nbefore they bring the ball to their chin\nor adjusting their hat.\nAnd if you watch individual pictures,\nwhat you'll find is that\nthey'll do the same sequence\nof completely irrelevant motor patterns\nbefore each and every single pitch.\nSimilarly, rats that have\nbeen trained to, for instance,\nhit two levers and step on a pedal\nwith their left hind foot, and then\ntap a button up above\nthat is the red button,\nwill do that to gain a piece of food.\nBut sometimes they'll\nalso introduce a pattern\ninto that motor sequence where they will\nshake their tail a little bit,\nor they'll turn their head a little bit,\nor they'll move their ears\na little bit, et cetera.\nMotor patterns that have nothing to do\nwith obtaining the\nparticular outcome in mind.\nIn other words, you could eliminate\ncertain components of the motor sequence\nand it would not matter, the\nrat would still get the pellet,\nthe pitcher would still be able to pitch,\nand yet that get\nintroduced because somehow\nbecause they were\nperformed again and again\nprior to successful trials,\nthe rat or the human baseball pitcher\ncomes to believe in some way\nthat it was involved in\ngenerating the outcome,\nhence superstition, right?\nI confess I have a few superstitions.\nI occasionally will knock on wood.\nI'll say something that I want to happen,\nand I'll say, oh, knock on\nwood, and I'll just do it.\nAnd occasionally I'll\nchallenge myself and think,\nah, I don't want to knock,\ndon't knock on wood,\nAndrew, don't do that.\nI don't think anyone\nwants to be superstitious,\nI certainly don't.\nAnd so every once in a while,\nI'll just challenge it, and I\nwon't actually knock on wood.\nI'm admitting this to you to kind of\nI guess normalize some of this.\nSome people have superstitions\nthat border on or even become compulsions.\nThey really come to believe\nthat if they don't knock on wood,\nthat something terrible\nis going to happen,\nmaybe something in particular.\nOr in the case of the baseball pitcher,\nthey come to believe\nthat if they don't touch\ntheir right ear before they\nreel back on the pitch,\nthat the pitch won't be any good\nor that they're going to lose the game.\nWell, I don't know what\ntheir thought process is.\nNow, I also don't know\nwhat the rat is thinking,\nbut the rat is clearly doing something\nor thinking something is\nrelated to the final outcome.\nI don't know of any studies\nwhere they've intervened\nwith the particular\nsuperstition-like behaviors\nof the rat to see whether or not the rat\nsomehow doesn't continue\nto do the motor sequence\nto get the pellet.\nWe don't know the rats, they're rats.\nI don't speak rat, most people don't,\nor if you speak to a rat,\nif it speaks back, it's not in English.\nAnyway, the point is that\nsuperstitions are beliefs\nthat we, on an individual\nscale, come to believe\nare linked to the\nprobability of an outcome\nwhen in fact we know, we actually know\nin our rational minds, they\nhave no real relationship\nto the outcome.\nSuperstitions can become full-blown\ncompulsions and obsessions\nwhen we repeat them often enough\nthat they become automatic.\nAnd I think this is what\nwe observe most of the time\nwhen we see a pitcher touching their ear,\nor for instance, in\ntennis, you see this a lot,\nyou'll see someone\nthey'll slap their shoes.\nOften, I see this, they'll like slap\nthe undersides of their soles.\nThey may tell themselves\nthat this is, I don't know,\nmaybe moving out some\nof the dust or something\nin the bottoms of their soles,\nthat gives them more\ntraction and they want that\nto be ready for the serve\nor something like that.\nAnd maybe there's some truth to that,\nbut here, what we're referring to\nare behaviors that really\nhave no rational relationship\nto the outcome, and yet we\nperform in a compulsive way.\nPeople with OCD, yes, tend\nto have more superstitions.\nPeople with more superstitions, yes,\ntend to have a tendency towards OCD\nand I should mention, obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nIf you think way back to the\nfirst part of this episode,\nwhen I was just describing\nwhat the brain does, right?\nWhat does your brain do?\nHousekeeping functions to keep you alive\nand it's a prediction machine.\nYour neural circuits, you,\nhave an enormous amount\nof biological investment\nof real estate, literally,\ncells and chemicals\nthat are there to try and\nmake your world predictable\nand to try and give you control,\nor at least the sense of\ncontrol over that world\nand that's a normal process.\nLow-level superstitions,\nmoderate superstitions\nrepresent a kind of a\nhealthy range, I would say,\nof behaviors that are aimed\nat generating predictability\nthat don't disrupt normal function.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder,\nprovided is not too severe,\nwould I think represent the next level\nalong that continuum.\nAnd then obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nas I pointed out earlier,\nis really a case of highly debilitating,\nhighly intrusive, really\novertake of neural circuitry\nover our thoughts and behaviors\nthat requires very\ndedicated, very persistent,\nand very effective\ntreatments in order to stop\nthose obsessions and compulsions\nand the anxiety that links them\nsomewhat counterintuitively\nby teaching people\nto tolerate that level\nof increased anxiety\nand interrupt those patterns.\nAnd fortunately, as we described earlier,\nsuch treatments exist,\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\ndrug treatments like\nSSRIs, also drug treatments\nthat tap into the glutamate system\nand into perhaps also the dopamine system,\nthe so-called neuroleptics.\nAnd then, as we described,\nthere's now an extensive\nexploration of things\nlike ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis,\nthe initial studies don't\nseem to hold much promise\nfor cannabis and CBD and\nthe treatment of OCD,\nbut who knows, maybe more\nstudies will come along\nthat will change that story.\nAnd then of course,\nbrain machine interface\nlike transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nAnd then just to remind you\nwhat I already told you before\ncombinations of behavioral\nand drug treatments\nand brain machine interface, I think,\nis really where the future lies.\nFortunately, good treatments exist.\nWe cannot say that any\none individual treatment\nworks for everybody.\nThere are fairly large\npercentages of people\nthat won't respond to one\nset of treatments or another,\nand therefore one has\nto try different ones.\nAnd then there are the\nso-called supplementation-based\nor more holistic therapies.\nToday, I've tried to cover each and all\nof these in a fairly\nsubstantial amount of detail.\nI realize this is a fairly long episode,\nthat is intentional.\nMuch like our episode on ADHD,\non attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder,\nI received an enormous number of requests\nto talk about OCD, and\nmy decision to make this\na very long and detailed episode about OCD\nreally doesn't stem from any desire\nto subject you to too much information\nor to avoid the opportunity\nto just list things off,\nbut what I've tried to\nprovide is an opportunity\nto really drill deep\ninto the neural circuitry\nand an understanding of\nwhere OCD comes from,\nhow OCD is different from things like\nthe personality disorders\nthat I described.\nAnd also to give you a\nsense of how the individual\nbehavioral and drug treatments work\nand perhaps don't work\nso that you can really make\nthe best informed choices,\nagain, highlighting the fact that OCD\nis an extremely common, extremely common,\nand yet extremely debilitating condition\nand one that I hope\nthat if any of you have,\nor that you know people that have it\nthat you'll both gain\nsympathy and understanding\nfor what they're dealing with,\nperhaps as a consequence of some\nof the information presented today,\nand maybe help them\ndirect their treatment,\nfind better treatment, and of course,\napply those treatments for some relief.\nIf you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease
