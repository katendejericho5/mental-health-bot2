    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Ido Portal.\nIdo Portal is somebody who\ntruly defies formal definition.\nHe is, however, accredited by many\nto be the world expert\nin all things movement.\nMovement is one of the more fascinating\nand important aspects\nof our nervous system.\nIn fact, it was the great\nNobel Prize winner Sherrington\nthat said, \"Movement is\nthe final common path.\"\nAnd what he was referring to is the fact\nthat so much of our nervous\nsystem is dedicated to movement\nand, in particular, that\nthe human nervous system\ncan generate the greatest\nvariety of forms of movement.\nWe can run, we can jump, we can crawl,\nwe can move at different speeds.\nFar more variation in movement\nand different types and speeds of movement\nthan any other animal in the\nanimal kingdom can perform.\nMy interest in bringing Ido\nPortal onto this podcast\nstemmed from a discussion about just that,\nabout Sherrington and the\nenormous range of movements\nthat humans can engage in.\nIdo is both a practitioner\nand an intellectual.\nWe all know what a practitioner is,\nit's somebody who walks the walk,\nwho actually performs the thing\nthat they are knowledgeable about.\nAnd indeed, Ido has studied capoeira,\na number of other martial arts,\ndance, gymnastics, various forms of sport,\nhe's trained top athletes\nlike Conor McGregor,\nand he has many, many\nother credits to his name\nas a practitioner and teacher.\nHowever, he is also a true\nintellectual of movement.\nI define an intellectual as somebody\nwho can both think about\nand talk about a subject\nat multiple levels of granularity\nthat is with exquisite detail\nand with exquisite simplicity\ndepending on their audience\nand depending on the topic at hand.\nAnd as you'll soon hear\nfrom my discussion with Ido,\nhe is both a practitioner\nand a true intellectual\nof all things movement.\nToday, through our discussion,\nyou will learn how the nervous\nsystem generates movement,\nand the different forms of movement,\nthe different speeds of movement.\nYou're also going to get\nan incredible insight\nthrough Ido's mind and eyes\nof how movement can serve us\nin the various context of life.\nNot just in sport, not just in exercise,\nbut in every aspect of our lives\nfrom the time we get up in the morning\nuntil the time we go to sleep at night,\nhow we engage with others,\nhow we engage with ourselves,\nindeed, how movement even informs\nrelationships of different kinds.\nI found our discussion to be\none of the most enlightening\nand interesting discussions\nthat I've ever had,\nnot just about movement, but\nabout the nervous system.\nI can assure you that by\nthe end of this episode,\nyou will not only learn a\ntremendous amount about movement\nthrough the eyes and mind of\nthe one and only Ido Portal,\nbut you also will learn a\ntremendous amount of neuroscience\nabout how the cells, and\ncircuits, and hormones,\nand neurotransmitters of your body\nassist in creating the\nvarious forms of movement\nthat you can generate,\nthat you're trying to learn and generate,\nand that perhaps you should think about\ntrying to learn and generate.\nAnd indeed, you'll learn\nsome protocols and tools\nfor how to do that.\nIn science, we have a phrase,\nactually it's a title,\nthat's reserved for only\nthe rarest of individuals,\nwe say that somebody is an n-of-1,\nmeaning a sample size of one.\nAnd as you'll soon learn,\nIdo Portal is truly an n-of-1.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin, mineral, probiotic drink\nthat also has adaptogens\nand digestive enzymes.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012,\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nIn fact, when people ask me,\n\"What's the one supplement\nthey should take?\"\nI always say, \"Athletic Greens\nbecause it covers all of those\nessential nutritional bases\nand the probiotics, adaptogens,\nand digestive enzymes\nare vital for things\nlike the gut microbiome.\"\nYour gut microbiome is trillions\nof little microbacteria\nthat live in your gut, and that\nsupport your immune system,\nyour endocrine system, and\nthe so-called gut-brain axis,\nwhich is important for mood and\nneurotransmitter production,\na huge number of biological\nsystems in your brain and body.\nAthletic Greens also taste great.\nI mix mine with water\nand I like a little bit of lemon juice\nor lime juice in there.\nAs I mentioned, I drink it twice a day,\nusually once in the morning,\nduring the phase of the day\nin which typically I'm fasting\nor around breakfast time,\nand then again in the afternoon\nor even in the evening.\nIf you like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nVitamin D3 and K2 are\nimportant for endocrine health,\nfor cardiovascular health,\nfor calcium regulation, and so on.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim this special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nthey're the absolute highest\nquality and practicality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with an\nenormous number of challenges.\nFor instance, when you\nmove from a shady area\nto a bright area, your\neyes have to adapt to that.\nROKA understands the various challenges\nthat the visual system has to face\nand they've developed\nsunglasses and eyeglasses\nwith all of that biology in mind.\nTheir glasses were developed\nby two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford.\nAnd initially, ROKA\nsunglasses and eyeglasses\nwere for athletes.\nThey designed eyeglasses\nthat then and still now\nwill stay on your face if you get sweaty.\nYou can wear them running,\nyou can wear them cycling, et cetera.\nThey're very lightweight,\nso lightweight in fact\nthat most of the time\nyou don't even remember\nthat they're on your face.\nBut ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nalso come in a terrific aesthetic\nso you can wear them anywhere.\nSo, unlike a lot of so-called\nperformance glasses out there\nthat make people look like cyborgs,\nyou can wear ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwhen exercising, to dinner, to work.\nAgain, the aesthetics are really terrific\nand really adaptable to all\nthose different environments.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's roka.com,\nand enter the code HUBERMAN to\nget 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's roka.com,\nenter the code HUBERMAN at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are customized to your sleep needs.\nI've talked a lot on this podcast,\nand on another podcast,\nand on social media\nabout the essential need for sleep.\nPut simply, sleep is the\nfoundation of all mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nJust a few nights or even\none night's poor sleep\ncan really hinder your mental health,\nphysical health, and performance\nin all aspects of life.\nHelix has customized sleep products,\nthat is mattresses and\npillows that are designed\nto your sleep needs.\nAnd you can figure out\nwhat those sleep needs\nare very easily by going\nto the helix website,\nthey have a quiz, it takes\njust about two minutes,\nand ask you questions like\ndo you sleep on your back,\nyour side, or your stomach?\nDo you tend to run hot or\ncold during sleep, et cetera?\nOr maybe you don't even know\nthe answers to those questions,\nthat's fine too,\nthat's an option that\nyou can answer as well.\nYou take the brief two-minute quiz\nand then Helix will match you\nto the ideal mattress and pillow for you.\nI matched to the so-called Dusk Mattress.\nI started sleeping on that\nwell over a year ago now,\nand it's the best sleep I've ever had.\nI'm sleeping much longer and much better\nthrough the entire night.\nAnd as a consequence,\nI'm feeling much better,\nmore clear, more physically\nalert, et cetera,\nthroughout the day.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman.\nYou can take that two-minute quiz\nand they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you,\nand you'll get up to $200\noff all mattress orders\nand two free pillows.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nyou go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off and two free pillows.\nAnd now, for my discussion\nwith Ido Portal.\nIdo, thank you for coming here today.\nI've been looking forward\nto sitting down with you\nto talk for a very long time.\nI was first exposed to your work\nfrom my post or a podcast I believe\nof you had a group of people\nwalking down handrails,\nliterally the handrails along stairwells.\nAnd as a, I don't want to\nsay former skateboarder,\nonce a skateboarder,\nalways a skateboarder.\nAs a skateboarder, handrails\nhave a particular meaning,\nbut I was really struck by, first of all,\nthe incredible range of\nskill that people had\nand yet their willingness to do this.\nRight, I think of handrails\nand walking on handrails\nor skateboarding on handrails\nas a potential hazard,\nand yet some of the incredible proficiency\nthat some of the people\nthere including yourself had.\nSo, like many people, I\nwas drawn to your practice\nand your work initially\nthrough a wide-eyed, \"Wow.\"\nYou know, they're doing\nsome incredible stuff\non natural objects,\nmuch as skateboarders or parkour folks do.\nBut over the years, we've\nbeen in communication\nand I've come to realize that\nyou're a true intellectual\nof the topic of movement.\nAnd I define it intellectual\nas somebody who can understand a topic\nat multiple levels of granularity,\ndetail, general, specific,\nconnections, et cetera.\nSo, to start off,\ncould you share with us your conception\nof this idea of movement?\nYou know, obviously movement\ninvolves translation through space,\nbut when you talk about\na movement practice,\nwhat are you really thinking about?\nWhat are we talking about\nwhen we talk about a movement practice?\n- It's a big question.\nI somehow left the definition,\nthe very tight definition\nof it out for myself\nbecause I felt it was\nstarting to constrict me\nand be around me\nand I let the practice\nitself really define it.\nBut I think part of\nour sense of everything\nis actually a sense of movement\nand then the stillness in\nthe background of that.\nSo, for me, this is the entity\nthat I refer to as movement,\nand using that perspective for\nself-evolution development,\nof course, the physical side,\nbut also movement of emotions,\nmovement of thoughts, and\nany other movement streams.\nAnd by switching these layers\nand examining it from different places,\nyou get a better and better sense of it.\nI think the visuals nowadays and media\nare what defines for people\nin the beginning things.\nAnd then little by little with experience,\nthey can dive deeper, which is good.\nThere is some aspect, sexy\naspect or not so sexy aspect,\nand then you pull on it\nand you start to examine\nand dive deeper, and then\nyou receive the gift of it,\nfinding out more.\n- I heard you say once\nthat we are not just a brain with a body,\nbut we are a body with a brain,\nwhich I absolutely love\nbecause as a student\nand a researcher of the nervous system,\nI never think about the brain\nas its own isolated thing,\nI think about the nervous system\nand the fact that the\nbrain and the spinal cord\nare connected to the body,\nand the body is connected\nto this, to the brain.\nAnd in every direction,\nit's everything truly is connected\nat the physical level,\nphysiological level.\nCould you just share for a moment\nhow you think about this\nbody-brain relationship\nin terms of you mentioned\nmovement of emotions,\nmovement of the body,\nthat you can't really separate the two.\nAnd for the typical person\nwho's listening to this,\nthey might not immediately\nunderstand what that means.\nMaybe it's something that\nhas to be experienced,\nbut when we think about\nthe body and the brain\nand the whole thing working\nas one cohesive whole,\nwhat does that mean to you?\nOr put simply,\nwhen you do a movement practice\nwhat are you focusing on?\nAre you focusing on the\nmovement of your limbs?\nI have to imagine that's true,\nbut are you also focusing\non how that makes you feel\nor how your feelings make you move?\n- Okay, okay, so some thoughts,\nI will try not to answer\nany of your questions\nduring this interview,\nbut I will definitely give some thoughts\nand then we can play with it.\nI think these definitions\nand, in general, the limitation of words\nends up creating\nsome kind of a corruptive process.\nYou know, words corrupt us\nand corrupt our understanding.\nSo, I think the brain-body,\nthis Cartesian state of mind and thinking\nbrought a lot of good, but\nalso brought a lot of problems.\nAnd movement, for me,\nis the entity that ties\neverything together.\nIt's the magic, it's the thoughts anima,\nit's when the coin spins\nand you see both sides\nappear at the same time.\nIt's a beautiful analogy\nfrom a friend of mine, Dr. Rasmus Olme.\nSo, the mind and body\nare one of those pairs,\nand I call it the\nmovement/body/mind system,\nso it's when it's\nintegrated, it's in motion.\nThere is also a stillness\nthat appears there, of course,\nand without it there can be no motion,\nbut maybe that is a very good way\nto start to think of things.\nThere is no really pure mental processes,\ncognitive processes.\nThere is no pure physical processes,\neverything touches everything,\nthere is a wholeness, and\nthat wholeness is in motion.\nYeah, the movement\npractice takes these beats\nand examined them.\nAnd here is a pragmatic thing,\nthe scientist, the cerebral\nthinking about movement,\nthis is important.\nThe emotional side coloring,\nfeeling the colors and\nthe textures of motion.\nA lot of people who are involved\nwith a movement practice\nnever end up feeling motions,\nreally focusing on how it makes you feel\nor how it feels itself.\nAnd then the actual movement, the action,\nso, it's action, emotion, and thought.\nAnd those are three streams of movement\nand they interlay together\ninto this kind of a braided experience\nand whole experience.\nAnd I try to bring all these\naspects into my practice\nand the way that I live my life.\n- I think most people who\nembark on a movement practice\nwill first want to know\nwhich movements to do, right?\nSquats, planks, push-ups,\npirouettes, right?\nPick your movement, it\ncould be any movement.\nAre there any sort of\njust basic entry points\nthat you believe everybody\nshould walk through\nas they embrace a movement\npractice the first time\nand maybe even every time\nthey do a movement practice?\nI mean, earlier today I\nhad the great privilege\nof being guided through a long\nseries of movement practices,\nand yet, the first\npractice we did involve,\nat first anyway, stillness not movement.\nSo, if you would, could\nyou inform us how people\nshould think about approaching\na movement practice?\nWhat is the first layer of\nany good movement practice?\n- So, you touched the word movement,\nand it's important for me to separate it\nfrom the word Movement with a capital M.\nMovements are the containers\nand movement is the content,\nand the content cannot be carried\nin any way without containers.\nSo, the first entry point\nis to choose containers,\nand then the second thing to make sure\nis to put specific content\ninto those containers\nand then enjoy them.\nI tell people that it's\nlike a cup of water\nand you're being handed that cup of water.\nAnd nowadays very often people\nwill start to chew on the cup\ninstead of drinking the water,\nmaking it yours and discard the cup.\nAnd then, maybe later you want\nto have bone broth or soup\nso you use a different container, a bowl.\nSo, a movement practice to\nstart can start from anywhere,\nit's a rhizome, it's an open system,\nit has no center, it's decentralized,\nand it can be approached from anywhere,\nand that's its magic and\nthat's the benefit of it.\nSome people find the\nbody a good entry point,\nsome people don't even\nenter from the body.\nSometimes you can enter\nfrom other perspectives\nand then inside the body,\nfor example, where should we enter?\nIf we decided to take the body approach,\nthe spine can be a nice decision,\nbut some will choose just the pelvis.\nAny one of those points are valid.\nAnd then, playfulness\ncan be an entry point,\nan attribute, and this is so open.\nSo, I don't want to limit\npeople and limit their minds\nin the way that they\nengage with the practice,\nbut I also want to\nencourage the self-inquiry.\nAm I doing movements practice,\nor am I doing a movement practice?\n- So, could you help\nme distinguish the two\na little bit further?\nI think I understand the difference\nbetween a sort of the\nnoun versus the verbs.\nAnd in some ways here we are\ndealing with the challenge\nof the barriers that language present\nto something that's physical, right?\nI mean, indeed, there may not be a...\nI have to assume\nthere is no perfect verbal\nlanguage for movement.\nThere are certain movements\nthat defy language.\nI could say somebody jumped\nat a particular trajectory\nat a particular speed and\nmoved this limb and that limb,\nbut by fractionating it something\nis most definitely lost.\nSo, if someone wanted to,\nlet's say, get in better touch\nwith their body, in quotes,\nin order to explore the\ninfinite space that is movement,\nhow might they begin to approach that?\nIs it does it begin with an awareness,\nwith practice, or both?\n- It begins with education.\nYou know, that's probably the\nmost stable point of entry,\nawareness to some something as a concept\nthat it is a concept,\nthat there is validity,\nor because sometimes people look for that\nto looking at this\nentity, this open entity.\nAnd that's part of the reason\nwhy answering questions\nis not something I can do\nor even attempt to do.\nI believe in the power of\nthe non-complete process,\nlike making this table,\nbut living something undone,\nnot perfecting the product, why?\nBecause it offers some kind of\na dynamic nature of evolution\nthat naturally unravels from it.\nAlmost like sometimes I do it,\nI count reps and I'll only count to nine\n'cause it tends to leave\npeople in the count\nand it keeps going instead\nof giving them the 10.\n- Everyone wants to end on 10. [laughs]\n- Yeah, which is because of\nthe decimal system, et cetera.\nSo, all kinds of things\nlike that is also important\nwith the movement idea is to discuss,\nto examine, to look, to taste, to try,\nbut then also not to try to capture\nbecause if you like the\ninvisible loop of Hoffstadt.\nIf you look at it too closely, it's gone,\nbut if you look away,\nit functions and exists\njust like us very powerfully\nand obviously gives us the\nexperiences that we have.\nSo, when people enter movement practice,\nit is about education,\nbringing some awareness to\nthe fact that they are living\nin a body, that they are living in motion,\nthat their mind is a type of movement,\nthat their life is a type of movement.\nBringing attention to the\nmovement of the emotions as well.\nBringing just attention to the fact\nthat things are in motion.\nThe Heraclitus panta rhei, all in flux,\nnothing stops besides something\nthat is the background of it\nand allows it to express,\nand this is the beauty of things.\nAnd this for me is the movement practice\nis this examination and bringing\nthis awareness into things.\nAs we sit now here, I'm\nalso aware of my body,\nI'm also aware of the way\nthat things make me feel,\nthe way that your face\nis communicating to me.\nAnd I'm not just in some limited\nand very verbal, overly verbal state\nbecause it misses a lot\nof the beautiful flux.\n- I'm going to inject some\nor project some ideas,\nand perhaps you would tell\nme if they're ridiculous,\npotentially useful, or useful.\nAs I understand what\nwe're talking about now\nand what we've discussed\nearlier is that movement\ncan and should be incorporated\ninto one's entire life.\nI've even heard you say\nthat even before getting\nout of bed in the morning,\none can experience movement,\nand it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be of the intimate kind\nwith somebody else, it's\nit can be paying attention\nto the rhythm of one's breath,\nor how you get out of the bed.\nOr actually, in anticipation\nof you arriving here today,\nI noticed that as I was\ngoing up and down the stairs\nin this house, that I was injecting\na little bit of playfulness\nin the way that I might\nhave many, many decades ago,\nbut haven't for a very long time.\nAnd I asked myself whether or not\nthat's what Ido is referring to\nwhen he talks about\nthreading this body awareness\nthroughout the day.\nAs opposed to, but of course not exclusive\nfrom just saying I have 45 minutes,\nI'm going to do movement practice\nbefore I shower and have some dinner.\nRight, I have to imagine both are helpful,\nbut in terms of moving through the day\nand having bodily awareness,\nclearly there are an\ninfinite number of ways\none could do that,\nmaybe you could just share a few.\nYou mentioned, I mean,\none could pay attention\nto their breath, could\npay attention to posture.\nAnd this notion of play\nis a very attractive\nor as we say in science,\nit's a sticky concept,\na concept that kind of draws one in.\nMaybe if you would, could you\nshare with us just some ideas\nto get people thinking about\nor maybe even incorporating\nmovement practice into their day,\nand maybe even touch on the potential role\nof play or playfulness?\n- Okay.\nYeah, those are some good directions.\nI think one thing is this\nwhat you call wordlessness.\nI have been recommending to\npeople non-verbal experiences\nand the awareness of the body,\nwhich is not really the awareness\nof the body, as you know,\nnot purely or not fully.\nThe awareness of motion is\na very good way to start\nto bring awareness to that layer.\nAnd that layer will start to get clarified\nmore and more and more,\nthe more you practice.\nAnd then, it will enable for most people,\na safe haven away from many\nstates and difficulties,\nand will unlock a lot\nof potential attributes,\nand strength, and freshness,\nand a lot of beautiful things.\nReally one of the really perspectives\nabout who we are comes from a person\nwho influenced my thinking a lot,\nMoshe Feldenkrais, the\nlate Moshe Feldenkrais.\nAnd he talks about the body\nas the core three elements,\nthe core nervous system,\ntwo is the mechanical system\nof muscle, skeleton, et cetera,\nand the third is the environment,\nwhich is a unique way to look at it.\nAnd he talks about how the nervous system\nis both receiving\ninformation from the outside\nand from the inside.\nAnd in the first years of life,\nyou work a lot on differentiating those,\nwhat is me and what is not me?\nAnd I think movement,\nwhen you feel movement,\nyou feel the movement of the outside\nthat is, of course, arriving\nto you and receiving this,\nand also your own internal movement.\nAnd the same can be said for stillness.\nSo, bringing the attention\ninto those layers,\nit's a tricky thing.\nIt's one of those elusive\nthings to look at,\nbut it's definitely of huge\nbenefit to start to train it,\nstart to practice it, to\nfeel not our thoughts,\nnot necessarily our body,\nbut to start to recognize\nthe dynamic nature, the flux, the motion,\nand it occurs in all these layers.\nSo, you will need to find\nit in multiple locations\nbefore you start to more\nand more make it your own,\nmake it really yours.\nHow, for example,\nsimple, pragmatic things\nI used to do this,\nI spent some time in Hong Kong,\nI would need to get my practice in,\nbut I'm really turned\noff from commercial gyms\nand there is not a lot of\nnature accessible there\nso I would just strap on my bag\nand I would walk the streets of Hong Kong,\nwhich are very crowded\nand then I would try to\navoid touching anyone.\nAnd it would be like two hours\nof just like moving, involved,\nfully involved, fully in my body,\nand experiencing beautiful things,\nand enjoying and developing myself as well\nin all kinds of scenarios,\nup and down in the escalators and off.\nSo, this is an example\nof a way to practice.\nAnd then, the way that we are sitting\nlike these chairs, for example,\nour chairs are not very dynamic,\nbut there is rocking chairs, right?\nAnd this is something I\nrecommend for a lot of kids\nlike in schools, I used\nto rock on the chair,\nwhich is very common.\nI'm sure-\n- I used to put my skateboard\nunderneath my chair and\nroll it back and forth,\nand the teacher would tell me to stop.\nAnd I would just slowly little by little\ntrying to get the most\nsubtle movement I could\nwithout them telling me\nthey were going to take it away, or try.\n- Which is probably\nhorrible, horrible advice\nand instruction just like sit up straight\nand chew with your mouth closed\nbecause they remove a\nlot of the self-education\nand a lot of the self-development\nand the practical discoveries\nthat are necessary\nand even will damage focus\nand thinking processes in some ways.\nSo, for example, I would make\nthe chairs even more mobile\nand I would support more motion,\nand then I would be able\nto bring attention there,\nbut I would also be able to\nbring attention away from it\ninto other things.\nAnd it keeps refreshing me\nso I don't become stale,\nthe water doesn't stand,\nthis is the beauty of movement.\nSo, you can focus for long periods of time\nand do incredible things with the mind,\nwith focus, with awareness, attention.\nAnd it's like we're skin in the game,\nso I'm not talking as some meditator\nand he's describing the\nact of being very focused,\nbut then I put a stick on\nthe edge of his fingers\nand I tell him, \"Balance it.\"\nAnd everyone can do it for 10 seconds\nand I tell him, \"Okay,\nnow hold it 10 minutes.\"\nAnd you see that the skill has,\nhe has no skin in the game.\nIt wasn't developed in various scenarios,\nbut so there is a delusion\nthat start to develop\nand that's how movement\nkeeps me very honest\nand humble in the way that I view humility\nand in a way that protects me\nand keeps me, yeah, it keeps me fresh.\n- I loved the example of moving\nthrough the crowded street\nwith a backpack because of the way\nin which it's completely adaptive\nto the situation you happened to be in\nand highlights the fact\nthat one doesn't need a gym\nor any specific scenario,\nalthough we will certainly touch\non ideal learning\ncircumstances for movement\nand some of the work that\nyou're doing, of course.\n- The less of your own personal practice,\nand understanding, and\nknowledge you've done,\nthe more toys you need.\nThe more you've really worked on yourself,\nthe more high-tech you are.\nThe more low-tech are your tools,\nthe more high-tech you are.\nAnd this is the most advanced technology\nby far on this planet.\nWith all the advancement, it\ndoesn't even start to scratch,\nand you know it,\nfrom the way that we understand the eyes\nall the way to with all the\nrespect to the Boston Robotics,\na 5-year-old motion-\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Movements.\nOr animal motion with very underdeveloped,\nstill relatively to us as systems.\nSo, important to remind ourselves.\n- A lot can be done with\nthe body and gravity\nas I-\n- Floor, a piece of floor,\na piece of wall, a corner of a\nroom is a beautiful scenario,\nwhich you can become\ndiscover in and play in.\nAnd, but we are not so developed\nso we don't see those options.\nAnd this is something\nthat I try to stimulate,\nand that's why I made it a point to avoid\nany of the big sponsorship\nand high-tech tools.\nAnd I on point brought a stick\ninto big conventions\nand/or sometimes I use\na shirt with holes in it\nthat just like a used\nshirt as a point to make\nwhen I'm addressing a crowd to keep things\nwhere it's important and it's important,\nwe are important, and our\nexperience is important.\nAnd we have to be very careful,\nthese habits and these directions,\nthey come from many times good intention,\nbut they are the devil many times,\nthey turn into the devil,\njust like our technology nowadays\nand what is happening with\npeople and with depression,\nwith meaning, meaninglessness,\nalso with the body in\nvarious perspectives,\nor even I will also flip it\ninto high performance sports\nand their price.\nBecause for me, this is\nnot a movement practice,\nit erases the person in the center of it.\nAnd then came places like\nskateboarding or break dancing\nwhere somebody with a disability\nbecomes the best in the world,\nturns it into the biggest advantage,\nbut you would never be\naccepted into gymnastics class,\nand I love that.\nAnd that change\nto place change in the\ncenter, it's important.\n- You touched on mention of a few sports,\nmaybe it was Charles Poliquin,\nor maybe it was another\ntrainer that I heard once say\nthat, \"For kids, one of the\nworst things they can do\nis overspecialize in a particular sport.\"\nThe idea being that it leads\nto improvements in performance\nin a very narrow domain,\nbut they raised the idea\nthat it could perhaps also constrains\nthe development of the nervous system,\nsuch that certain emotional states,\ncertain intellectual abilities\nwill forever be shut off\nbecause of the intense plasticity\nthat occurs early in life.\nThe more I learn from you,\nthe more I'm thinking that that statement\nreally should be extended to all of life.\nAnd I love to remind people\nbecause I started off as a\ndevelopmental neurobiologist,\nthat development doesn't start and end,\nyou don't have childhood and adulthood.\nOur life is one long developmental arc\nfrom birth until death,\nhowever long that might be.\nSo, if one is going to be anti-specialist,\nmaybe even we call that a generalist,\nwhat does that look like?\nWhat are the different\ndomains of movement practice?\nAnd as I asked this, I\nrealized I am in serious danger\nof fractionating movement\ninto a list of words\nlike strength, and speed, and\nexplosiveness, and suppleness,\na word that I've heard you use before.\nAnd yet, I think for most people\nbecause we think in words, often,\nsome of those categories can be useful.\nSo, let's say I was going to\nembark on a movement practice\nor a child was going to\nembark on a movement practice\nand either throughout the day\nor for a dedicated period of time,\nwhat are the sorts of\ncategories of movement\nthat I might want to think about,\nballistic movement, smooth movement?\nMaybe you could just enrich us\nwith some of the landscape around that.\n- Okay, first I'll address the first part\nthat you mentioned.\nAnd I've learned from\nyou about certain changes\nin the way that things\ndevelop later in life\nversus earlier in life.\nAnd you're right, it is something\nthat Charles Poliquin also mentioned\nand I learned from back in\nthe day as well from him,\nwhich can seem dark a\nbit and kind of hopeless,\nbut then you should go beyond that.\nOne thing that does seem to appear\nfor me when I look around\nis these the concepts of unique postures.\nAnd I think this is true\nfor postures of thought,\nemotional postures, and movement postures.\nTruly, earlier in life,\nwe are creating these unique postures\nand they get into these drawers\nor like language letters.\nLater in life, the process moves more\ntowards integration of\nthese unique postures\ninto all different organizations.\nThe beauty of it is that you\ncan use very few postures\nto create many possibilities,\njust like a lib needs\na search for a language\nthat contain one symbol only versus two,\nwhich he discovered.\nAnd this is something that is often seen,\nlike you take someone who\nmoves in a certain way\nand you teach them all these\nnew sports or techniques,\nbut essentially if you look\ndeeply and you're sensitive,\nyou see it's the same postures\nthat he will have to work\nwith till the end of his life,\nthe same thinking postures.\nAnd this is really problematic,\nwhere we are not freeing\nthe mind beyond this,\nhow would I say, a scaffolding of thinking\nand we are actually\nletting go of the content.\nWe get more and more focused\non the way of thinking\nversus the thinking itself,\nor habitual ways and forms of thinking,\nassociated thinking, et cetera.\nAnd emotionally the same,\nwe are constructing\nthese emotional postures\nand then we have to go\nthrough the rest of our lives\nworking with that.\nSo, this is the dark side, right?\nBut of course, there are\nalways possibilities,\nboth I think invading this early system,\nto some extent, even if it's\n5%, or 7%, or whatever percent,\nand also on the freeing yourself\nof going beyond all postures period.\nWorking with the postures you have,\nbut towards a postureless\nway of doing things.\nSo, this is something interesting to work\nwhen people work with movements,\nbut finally are able to go into movement\nand this magic starts to happen,\nand then the techniques fall\napart and something appears,\nand it's a face change,\nit's a transformation,\nit's a binary moment.\nThere is a jump there for sure,\nand it's very rare to see both\nin thinking, and emotionally,\nand other ways, we have many names for it.\nAnd some talk about enlightenment\nand some talk about all kinds\nof processes related to it.\nAnd I think most of them\nare shadows of the sun,\nbut it's not the sun itself really.\nAnd then, talking about ways\nof thinking about movement,\nthis is where I use something\nI called my slice and dice\nbecause of the problem of using words,\nand definitions, and categories,\nI try to create a lot of them\nand I write them on the paper\nand then I crumble them,\nthrow them into the bin, and\nI keep doing it all my life.\nThe writing them down\nand the geeking on it\nis very important, also\nvery important to let it go.\nI tell people what you\nforgot is not the same,\nforgetting is not the\nsame as never knowing it.\nThe crumbling and throwing\naway is a form of forgetting,\nbut it leaves some kind of a homeopathic\ntrace behind.\nSo, let's take some slice and dice,\nand try to look at it.\nHere is a physical one,\ncontraction, relaxation.\nThat's a spectrum,\nand pretty much everything\nfalls on this spectrum.\nAlso, in terms of analyzing\na person or yourself,\nyou can tell me if you\nfeel closer to this side\nor closer to that side,\nand then it allows you to\nexamine your practices.\nHow many of the practices are\nmoving you towards balance\nand how many are it's your addiction\nof just doing what you're\ngood at versus what you need?\nHere is another example, physical culture.\nSo, we have the dense realm\nworking with internal concepts\nand expressing them, abstract\nconcepts, expression.\nSecond perspective, the Marshall concept,\nbut not in the sense of just fighting,\nbut also partnering,\nworking with another person,\na dynamic entity that is\ncommunicating with you.\nThe third one is I call the elements,\nworking with the environment.\nThe next one is a somatic\none, is the internal practice.\nAnd of course, there are all gray zones,\nand another one is object manipulatory,\nwhich you can think of it\nalso as the environment,\nbut it's more small objects,\nheavy objects, many objects, few objects.\nAnd then you can look\nat this way of thinking,\nand you can say, \"Oh, I\nhave many of my practices\nin this direction, but not,\"\nand you can draw it for yourself.\nSo, that's another perspective,\nand this way I use dozens of perspectives.\nAnd with the years,\nit gives people a sense\nof where they want to go,\nhow they want to do it,\nand what they need to address\nversus what they like\nto address, et cetera.\nIs it helpful?\n- Very helpful, those different\nbins are very helpful.\nI really appreciate that you mentioned\nthat people will often\npractice what they're good at\nas opposed to what they need.\nIn gym culture, we refer to this\nas the guy that always skips\nleg day type of person, right?\nYou know, big upper body, skinny legs,\nor you you'll see people\nthat have these enormous thick torsos\nand they're bench pressing all day,\nbut they clearly need to pull on an object\nevery once in a while\nto create some balance,\nbut they don't do it because\nthey, for whatever reason,\nthey have an obsession with moving\ngreater and greater poundage\nor something like that,\nwhich in certain sports like power lifting\nor aesthetics aren't the goal,\nand it's simply to push\nmore weight off one's chest\nthat you could imagine\nthat there's something beneficial there.\nHowever, I think that\nit's really important\nin intellectual endeavors\nand in movement endeavors,\nif I understand correctly,\nto bring oneself to a\nplace of real challenge\non a regular basis.\nIn fact, earlier today,\nI was in a state of constant challenge\n'cause it was all new to me.\nAnd as much as I told\nmyself, \"Beginners' mind,\nbeginners' mind, beginners' mind,\"\nit's hard, I confess,\nto not want to do well,\nto perform well, right?\nAnd I think that's a\nnatural and healthy thing.\nYet-\n- Not only natural,\nit is necessary,\nbut I want you to keep it on that side\nand to bring something to balance it.\nIf there is not this challenge,\nthe process will not work.\nIt has to be this scale.\nAnd you're talking about\nscales of pain, pleasure,\nand this is another scale.\nAnd this discomfort again is necessary\nand should be recognized as,\n\"I'm in the right place.\"\nWhen it becomes too high\nand I'm unable to resolve,\nto make any progress,\nI went overboard, but\nwhen it's not present,\nI don't do nothing here.\nNothing that I'm truly interested in,\nI'm just gratifying myself, wankery.\nIt's in essence,\nit's not about searching\nfor the discomfort,\nbut it's a marker.\nAnd I think the question\nshould be who am I serving?\n'Cause people do not serve\nthemselves, in essence,\nthey serve part, parts of it,\nsome kind of a fraction of themselves.\nAnd this separation of\noneself from oneself,\nand this is also a result of\nthe practice, a good practice.\nI think maybe the biggest gift I received\nfrom the practice is I can say\nalthough it will take\nmaybe a certain context,\nI am not my friend.\nAt times I am,\nbut many times I am not my friend.\nAnd by creating this separation,\nI can assume a certain stability\nin the face of everything\nall the way up to our\nown mortality and death,\nwhich is, and maybe beyond, who knows?\n- Yeah, it was a striking\nmoment for me earlier today\nwhen I was really challenged\nwith one of the practices we were doing,\nand you said, \"This is\nexactly what I experienced\nthis morning, Andrew,\"\nthat's what you said.\nAnd I couldn't imagine that\nyou were having challenges\ndoing what I was attempting to do.\nAnd of course, you were,\nand I believe what you were referring to\nis that you had put yourself at that edge\nearlier in the day in which\nyou were making failures,\nyou were failing to execute\nthe way that you were\nattempting to execute movement.\nI should just to inject some neuroscience\nand neuroplasticity there,\nI can't help myself,\nit is what I do after all.\nThere are beautiful data\nin animals and humans\nshowing that in the seconds and minutes\nafter a failed attempt at a\nmotor execution of something,\nthe forebrain is in a\nheightened state of focus.\nAnd when you hear it,\nsuddenly makes perfect sense,\nof course, why would the\nnervous system change\nunless it got a cue to change?\nAnd the cue almost always comes\nin the form of frustration,\nthe [imitates buzzer] or\nas we said earlier, nah,\nthe nah signal\n[Ido laughing]\nis the one that preps you\nto extract more learning\nfrom the subsequent trials.\nAnd yet, for a lot of people,\nthey feel that ugh,\nthat failure to execute,\nor even to approximate execution\nand they feel and experience\nthat ah negative signal,\nand they lean out of the practice,\nthey start to depart either\nmentally or physically or both.\nAnd if there's anything I\nthink that perhaps we can offer\nis this understanding that that edge\nas some people call it\nor that failures aren't just necessary,\nthey are part of the learning process,\nthey are the entry gate\nto neuroplasticity.\n- Yes, contextualizing\nor recontextualizing\nthat sensation is\nsomething I work a lot with\nand I just remind people\nand I also reminded to myself,\nand if it wasn't difficult\nand we didn't need to\nredo it again and again,\nwe wouldn't be again\non this correct scale,\nwhich is dynamic and moving\njust like rolling downhill.\nSo, there is definitely a\nnecessity to succeed, to orient,\nthere is certain aspects\nthat you want to achieve,\nbut then there is also\nthe letting go of it\nand the deambitioning of it.\nAnd within that tension,\nthe plus and the minus comes movement,\nand that that's how I did it.\nAnd again, if I stretch it too far away,\nor if I increase one of them too much,\nthen I would have some issues,\nbut you will with practice\nlearn to recognize the\noptimal point of progression.\nOf course, it takes many years\nand a lot of play and\nexposure to get a sense of it,\nregardless of the layer\nin which it is applied.\nSo, I'm sure in your field\nand in your pursuits,\nyou are already aware of it\nand applying it in your life,\ntalking about focus, talking\nabout ways of thinking,\ncreativity, et cetera.\nBut then it's enough that I\npull into another perspective\nand you will see that\npeople are specialists,\nand then they don't have\nreally the real essence\nof the concept.\nIt's not theirs, it's\napplied specifically.\nThe one who changes all the time\ngets the general component\nbecause what appears\nwhen everything changes?\nThat is that new entity.\nEverything changes, something stays.\nThat's what we want to get,\nthis concept and this understanding.\n- I've heard the statement before,\nwe are just a meat vehicle, right?\nWe're just a sack of cells\nand it's I truly despise that statement\nbecause, first of all,\nit deprives us of all\nmeaning in of our lives.\nAnd we can go down the route of philosophy\nas to whether or not\nthere's meaning or not,\nbut more importantly, it\ndivorces us from the idea\nthat the body and brain are interconnected\nand have at least equal\nvalue at any one moment\nthat they're informing each other.\nEmotions inform movement,\nmovement informs emotions.\nOne thing that I've heard you say before,\nand I'd really love to\nhear you embellish on\nis this important principle\nthat human beings are truly unique\nin terms of the enormous\nrange of movements\nthat we can perform.\nAnd yet, we are excellent,\nmaybe superior to all other species\nat certain types of movement.\nThe one that comes to mind is\nwalking, strides, striding.\nSo, maybe we could just explore that idea\nbecause obviously a cheetah is very fast,\nthe gibbon seems to have\na lot of proficiency\nat grabbing and swinging from branches,\nbut human beings perform an enormous\nor can potentially perform an\nenormous array of movements.\nDo you think all human beings\nare potentially able to explore\nall the different types of movement?\nAnd if so, how does one approach that?\nSo, basically what I'm doing\nis I'm tabling a concept,\nwhich is not range of motion,\nright, for the gym rats,\ndiscard with range of motion,\nI'm talking about the\nvariety of movements.\n- First, it's not important what I think,\nif it's possible or not possible,\nor if it's even possible for\nyou or not possible for you,\nwhat is important is what\nyou truly want to do,\nwhat you truly are after.\nAnd it's important for\nme because many times,\nthis way of thinking about\nthings is already limited.\nI like to say\na man doesn't go to the ocean\nto empty it with a spoon.\nA lot of the types of dressing\nup of the concepts nowadays\nis trying to fit an elephant\ninto the hole in the needle, yeah?\nLike for example, the concept of practice,\nand then our lives, as if we have a life.\nWe have some kind of\na stream of behaviors,\nwe have there is an argument\nof free will, et cetera.\nThere is a multiplicity,\ndefinitely a man is a legion,\nthat's the real meaning of that phrase.\nOne day you wake up like this,\nI say, \"Andrew, let's\nmeet tomorrow at 7:00 am,\"\nbut I don't know who's\ngoing to wake up tomorrow.\nAnd then you send me a text message,\n\"Oh, I'm feeling off,\"\nright at 6:55 and go back to sleep.\nSo, examining that and seeing that\nI think frees you up eventually\nand start to orient you\nin a better direction.\nSo, what do you want to do and what,\nbut in the orientation of\nalso what you need to do,\nwhat you sense, and\nwhat you are developing\nas an evolutionary direction for you,\nthis is the important bit.\nIs it possible for everyone to engage\nin certain specific physical movement?\nFor example, in Scandinavian countries,\nthe squat is not very approachable,\nit's very difficult.\nThey're more built for\ndragging heavy things\nand also in this climate, I guess it,\nit makes less sense to squat\nand 'cause you're going to freeze there.\nSo, this is and then you see\nthe squat in warm climates\nand it's like so open and accessible.\nThey're very good deadlifters usually,\nnot good squatters and the-\n- They want to get away from the ground.\n- Yeah, the shallow hip socket,\nwhich allows one activity,\nbut then the stability\nof the deep hip socket\narchitecture of the hip,\nthe femur heads, the Q\nangles, the shapes, et cetera.\nSo, we are all unique and\nthere are certain elements,\nwhich like, for example,\nmy squat challenge\nis like for most people\nthere is something there, but-\n- Could you remind people\nwhat the squat challenge is?\n- The squat was my attempt to bring\na new, fresh state of\nmind into the word squat,\nnot as a strength element,\nbut it's a fundamental\nresting position really.\nActually, should be one\nof the most abundant ones,\nwe replaced it with sitting,\nwhich is not really doesn't work well\nif you're in a natural environment,\nit's not very comfortable\nactually to sit for long periods of time,\nrocks and different terrains\nso you end up lying down,\nstanding, and squatting a lot.\nAlso, when you're moving low and dynamic,\nlike even collecting berries,\nthe squat is much more dynamic and open.\nAnd then elimination is happening there,\nso it's like it's such a fundamental thing\nand we totally eliminated it.\nWe eliminated many other things,\noverhead movements, behind the back,\nall kinds of back realm\nwhat I call the back\nrealm is totally absent\nin people's awareness.\nSo, that was my attempt to\nbring it back into people,\nand I recommended to in order\nto really get the transformation,\ngoing to accumulate 30 minutes\na day in the squat position,\nunloaded, just resting down,\nnot correct, not erect, many\npeople make this mistake,\nthey didn't read through the whole thing.\nIt's just resting down there.\nAnd of course, you have\nto be mindful of dosages.\nSome people will get hurt if\nthey try to do it too quickly\nso they might need a\nbuildup process towards it.\nAnd also, I'm not talking\nabout 30 minutes straight,\nbut accumulation throughout the day.\nAnd this does a lot of good\nfor digestive problems,\nfor lower back pain, for\nhip pains, for knees,\nand generally for aging\nbecause it's basically folding your body\nin the most basic way.\nAre you folding your body?\nIf you're not folding your body,\nyou will lose the\nfoldability of your body.\nAnd this is probably the easiest\nand the most abundant\nway to fold the body.\nSo, but this is an example of something\nthat can be very useful\nwith many, many people,\nbut there will always\nbe unique individuals\nwhich needs something else.\nAnd there are benefits\nin examining things\nand also there are\nbenefits in getting hurt,\nwhich is not often discussed,\nespecially not in these parts.\nSo, I'm one of the only ones as a teacher\nthat says, \"I injured\nmany of my students.\"\nAnd if I did not do that,\nI would be totally\nuseless for them as well.\nThat totally safe system\nhas nothing to offer,\npractically nothing is totally safe.\nAnd we can, of course,\nwe don't approach it\nwith a ballsy or machoistic thing,\nbut we are aware that sometimes\nwe have to go beyond the boundaries\nand hopefully those would\nbe the small injuries\nthat will help us avoid the big injuries.\nBut if you try to avoid\nthe small injuries,\nmaybe you'll get those\nbig injuries in there.\nSo, examining which types\nand forms of movement,\nthe location of the\nbody, speed of execution,\nthe type of organization of the body,\nwhich is a whole thing\nthat we can discuss.\nAll of this is up for the grabs\nand something that we have to create\nindividual relationship with,\nhopefully with good guidance,\nwhere we can get the right scenarios,\na facilitator of good\nscenarios for our learning,\nwhich is what I try to do.\nAnd less of a technical state of mind,\ndo this ABC or, yeah, like chunking\nwhat I really dislike from a long time\nis like many people they tell me,\n\"Have you met this guy?\nHe's an amazing teacher\nbecause he chunked the\nprocess into these bits\nand not even in the\ncorrect places to chunk,\"\nit was like and it doesn't offer,\nit locks us, this state of mind.\nI talk about the chemistry model,\nI call it my chemistry\nmodel where an atom,\na molecule, and then a\ncompound is conceptualized\nversus just chunking.\nSo, there is an actual evolution\nlike I call it also sketch learning.\nI'm not going to try to draw you,\nif I know anything about art and drawing,\nI'm going to start by\ncapturing something very rough.\nAnd I need to practice that\nfirst, that dynamic entity,\nbefore I go into the rendering\nand the shading, et cetera.\nSo, the same way to learn things,\nso big picture, the small details.\nAnd unlike many of my\nteachers in that I ran into,\nand I say, with the greatest respect\nbecause I don't know who taught me more,\nmy good teachers or my worst teachers,\nbut some of them just teach\nfrom the small details\ninto a big picture that never arrives.\n- Given that humans can\ngenerate such a broad array\nof types of movement,\nrun, jump, duck, squat, leap,\nand all these types of movements.\nDo you think there's value\nin observing the movements\nof other animal species?\nI know I certainly enjoy\nwatching other animals move.\nI think the most,\none of the more spectacular animal facts\nthat was shared with me is\nwhen I was a graduate student,\nsomeone down the hall was\nworking on the little pedals\nof the chameleon, which can walk up walls.\nAnd it was a great mystery\nas to whether or not they were suction,\nbut turns out they can do it in a vacuum,\nso it's not suction.\nWhether or not there was\nsome sticky substance\nand it turned out, I don't know,\nI feel compelled to share this with you\nso I'm going to do it\nbecause I have a feeling\nit will lead us to an\ninsight of some sort,\nthat those little tiny pedals are so thin\nand so close together that the chameleon\nactually sticks to the wall\nby what are called van der Waals forces,\nmeaning it's a very weak molecular force,\nbut strong enough to stick to the wall\nbecause they are actually\nexchanging molecules\nwith the surface they're on.\n- Wow.\n- So, obviously\nwe can't do that, and yet I spent hours,\nbecause they were in the lab next door,\nwatching videos of these\nlittle chameleon walk\nand the articulation of\nthese feet is incredible\nbecause they're literally\nrolling those little pedals along\nin a way that it kind of defies\nanything else I've ever seen.\nI told myself this was useful,\nA, because I thought it was interesting,\nbut, B, because I never\nreally thought about\nhow I articulate my foot.\nI've thought about being a heel striker\nor a toe striker when I run\nand no one can tell me which\none I'm supposed to be.\nAnd maybe you can tell me,\n[Ido laughing]\nbut the point is, or I\nsuppose the question is,\ndo you think there's value in observing\nthe extremes of animal kingdom movement\nas a way to inform the play space\nand the exploration space\nof our own human movement practice?\n- I think so.\nI think, first, it's inspiring,\nit opens up, but I will take it away\nfrom the romantic point of view.\nAnd I would offer another way\nto examine all these movements exist in us\nin ways, in certain ways.\nLike the work of Gracovetsky on the spine,\n\"The Spinal Engine\",\nand to see how these old ways\nof moving even all the\nway up to exoskeletons\nand like primary, very ancient\nor even single cell\nthings are still within us\nto a certain extent.\nAnd then, of course, this gets developed\nlike the Darwinian state of mind\ngot stuck for many years on\nthe survival of the fetus.\nBut actually, I believe,\nI always believed and\nI saw some information\nabout it lately that mutation\nis the heart of the model,\nnot survival of the fittest.\n- Yeah, people often\nhear the word mutation\nand they think, \"Oh, mutations are bad.\"\nThere are maladaptive mutations\nand then there are adaptive\nmutations, for sure.\n- And then, this places the\nword change in the heart of it,\nwhat it wants to do, change.\nSo, it does not want to become better,\nthere is an inherent change in it.\nAnd then, of course, they\nbecome better at X, Y, Z,\nfittest is the secondary perspective\nthat arrives in relation\nto certain things,\nbut there is still a stronger,\nmore ancient driving\nforce into the process.\nSo, for me, this is cool\nto see these animals\ntake it all the way to this extreme,\nbut it's also still reflecting within us.\nSo, I love to do, like for example,\nI introduce with people spinal waves,\nand by bringing these waves into the body,\nsometimes you get weird\nexperiences like emotional releases\nand sometimes, and other times\nit can become an incredible\ntool to help an athlete\nwhich specialized and\nreach the top of the top.\nAnd then, you defrag\nhis system a little bit\nand offer him some freshness\nand some segmental movement.\nAnd first you fuck him up,\nthat's usually the case.\nTechnically he's off,\nhis coordination is off,\nbut later the growth will arrive.\nIt's a form of playfulness,\nit's a form of examining things\nregardless of their success or failure.\nMore understanding that\nchange is important\nand then after that,\nwe can also look at the more\ncompetitive state of mind\nand the more success\nand failure orientation,\nbut there is no game without change.\nSo, this is the primary one,\nand that's why I say, \"Okay,\nyou want to succeed in the\ntasks like we did earlier,\nbut you stayed within the\ngame, to sustain the game,\nthe infinite versus\nfinite game perspective.\"\nTo sustain the game means\nto continue to change,\ncontinue to transform,\nand then to win the game\nsometimes mean game over.\nSo, it's like, yeah, within that tension\nI think it's beautiful to\nplay, and to exist, and to be.\n- You mentioned something that for me\nis an incredibly important concept\nfor a couple of reasons,\nand you mentioned these spinal waves.\nRight, I have to assume that's\ntaking the torso for us,\nyou know, movement morons\nthat I'll just refer to in\ncoarse terms of thoracic spine.\nSo, I mean, I will stay away\nfrom the technical anatomy\nand the torso and creating movement\neither side to side undulation\nor arching and extension of the spine.\n- Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side to side,\nor rotational as well as spiraling.\n- Have you ever had the\nexperience that of yourself\nor other people engaging\nin those types of movements\nand experiencing particular\ncategories of emotions?\nAnd I have a particular\nreason for asking this,\nthere's no right or\nwrong answer, of course,\nbut I'm just curious\nwhether or not movement\nof let's call it the core of the body,\nthings close to the midline\nas opposed to far away from the\nmidline like the digits far.\nIs there any,\ndo you have any evidence\nthat that can evoke\na certain category of emotional states?\n- Evidence, I have none,\nbut I have experience and I\nhave some thoughts about it.\nIda Rolf is known to have created Rolfing\nor structural integration\nsaid, \"The issues are in the tissues.\"\nAnd around the spine, the spine is us,\nas you know, it's like can\ntake an arm off, a limb,\nbut there's been attempts,\nbut there is no brainy alone,\nthis cerebral thing alone,\nthe spine and the maybe\nmore parts of n-systems\ninside the torso are important.\nSo, that's why I like to\nstart from that core entity.\nAnd then these little\nfluctuations they create,\nthey unblock things, they\nstart to move things.\nAnd you can avoid, funny enough,\nmobilizing those areas by\ndoing big frame motions,\nand competitive motions, and\ntechniques all your life.\nSo, even most yogis, for example,\nthey look extremely mobile,\nbut then when you're actually\ngoing into the small,\nwhat I call the small frame,\nI borrowed this from Chinese martial arts,\nsmall frame, big frame.\nThe big frame is this big changes\nof our total body in space posture.\nAnd then the small frame is barely moving,\nbut mobilizing the\nlittle bits that comprise\nthe same pretty much posture.\nSo, these are very beneficial\nand it has totally disappeared\nfrom our physical culture.\nWhen you introduce it back,\nthe small frame offers the big frame,\nbut the big frame doesn't\noffer the small frame\nbecause, of course, the\nsmall detail come together\ninto the big picture.\nSo, if I want to place my\nbody in a specific position\nand I have all these bits moving well,\nI can construct it in whatever way I want.\nBut if I just work on the big one,\nmost chances are I just\nmobilize certain areas\nwhile other areas are\ntotally held or blocked\nand then I'm specialized one more time.\nTake me out of this realm\nand I'll have difficulties.\nWhat will sit there in this stagnation?\nEmotion, material, thoughts, traumas.\nThat's why people get discharges.\nThe body memory is not\nwhat we think it is,\nthat's how I believe,\nit is stored in a lot everywhere,\nand I've had those experiences.\nA lot of people have the opposite.\nWhen a certain emotion is evoked,\nthey start to undulate the spine.\nSo, this can be worked from this direction\nor from this direction.\nAnd I believe by applying such a practice,\nit is wise, you basically\nturn over the lens\nand you are allowing things\nto shift, and to move, and to adapt.\nSo, I highly recommend it\nand we teach it in a very\nelaborate and gradual way.\nAnd this is needed really\nbecause people, when they just go\ninto like some general recommendation,\nthey usually just get\nstuck into a new pattern,\n\"Ah, that spinal wave,\nokay, that's it.\"\nSo, I've been using,\nagain, this slice and dice-like teaching\ndozens of systems of moving the torso\nuntil a person is freed\nto really move the torso\nlike the language is created,\nthe small enough units are\ncreated in your understanding\nfrom all these systems\nand then you improvise,\nyou reach the highest\nlevel of the practice.\n- I love the answer.\nLet me tell you a bit of why I asked.\nSo, there's a principle in neuroscience,\nbut especially in neuroevolution,\nthey call it evo-devo sometimes,\nevolution and development,\nhow those link.\nIf you look at, so we have motor neurons,\nas you know, but for the audience,\nthat live in our spinal cord\nthat cause transmission and\ncontraction of the muscles,\nallows us to move our limbs.\nAnd then, we have motor neurons up here\ncalled upper motor neurons\nthat control the motor lower ones.\nSo, once something is\nreflexive or learned,\nwe're not thinking about it, so to speak,\nwe mainly use the lower motor neurons.\nWe know this because you\ncan do an experiment,\nit's a rather barbaric experiment,\nbut it's been done many times\ncalled creating a decerebrate cat.\nYou actually remove the neocortex\nand these cats will walk on a treadmill,\nit's called fictive\nmotion, no problem at all.\nThere are human beings\nwho don't have a neocortex\nor much of their neocortex is missing,\nthey generate perfectly fine movement.\n- The pattern has been download.\n- That's right, and it's truly\ndownloaded into the spine\nand the connection between\nthe spine and muscles.\nNow, the motor neurons\nthat control the spinal\nwaves, as you called them,\nare of a particular category.\nThey have a molecular signature,\na physiological signature,\nthey were identified by, he's dead now,\nbut a biologist at Columbia\nUniversity named Tom Jessell,\nand many of his scientific offspring.\nHere's what's interesting,\nin fish or in animals that\nreally only have the opportunity\nto undulate and flap their little fins.\nThough, motor neurons\nthat control undulation in those animals\nare identical molecularly to\nthe motor neurons that control\nthe spinal undulation in humans.\nWhat's been added in human\nevolution are extra rows,\nliterally categories, of\nmolecularly distinct neurons\nso that as you move from the\ncenter of the body outward,\nunlike a fish, which can move its fins,\nbut can't actually, it\ndoesn't have digits.\nWe have special motor neurons\nto move these little bits,\nthese bits, these bits,\nand I can't do a spinal wave,\nbut I can do the mudras thing,\nlike the belly thing.\n- Ah-ha.\n- That comes from seeing\nthe movie \"E.T.\" when I was a kid\nand puffing out my stomach\n[Ido laughing]\nand then realizing that I could wave it,\nbut only in one direction and-\nOkay.\n- apparently not up.\nAnyway, the yogis out there\ncan chuckle at that, but.\n- The yogis actually do it to the side.\n- Oh, do they?\n- Yeah.\n- I don't know if I can do that.\nAnyway, my spinal wave is\nweak, but I'll work on it.\nBut what I find so\ninteresting about these layers\nof, I don't want to say sophistication,\nbut these with evolution\ncame the addition of more\npools of opportunity.\nThese motor neuron\npools, as they're called,\nare opportunity to engage in new,\nmore elaborate types of movement.\nBut with each new pool\nbecame the opportunity\nto create combinations of new movement.\nAnd so, the reason I\nasked you why spinal waves\ncreate one category of movement\nis that if you touch a fish\non one side of its body,\nit moves to the opposite side,\nit never moves toward it.\nBut earlier we were doing a practice,\nsomewhat similar of testing\nthis similar reflex.\nAnd sometimes I or someone\nwill move toward a touch,\nwe don't deviate to the opposite side.\nSo, I have this untested,\nat least formally tested hypothesis\nthat movements of small digits\nand portions of our\ndistal, as they're called,\nfar from the midline body parts\nevoke different sensations,\nmaybe even far more subtle sensations\nthan movements of the core of our body\nand the stuff closer to the spine.\nAgain, it's just a theory,\nbut I'm grateful for your answer\nbecause it lands at least in\nthe general vector direction\nof my idea here.\n- The central orientation is\nmostly gone from our culture,\nwe don't even walk basically these days.\nIf you look at traditional culture,\nthe amount of walking you\ndo on a rest day, it's huge.\nAnd so, we started to create technologies\nto bring everything into the periphery,\ncontrolling it with the\nfingertips, et cetera.\nSo, we have incredible\nneurological development\nrelating to this, but\nour central patterns,\nswimming, running, jumping, throwing,\nthrowing is not pushing away,\nthat's an example, right?\n- Like some people when you\ngive them a ball to throw,\nthat you can tell if they've never\nthrown a ball before.\n- Yeah,\nthey throw like a girl.\n- Yeah, they don't just-\n- That is often said\n[Andrew laughing]\nhere in the US.\nAnd it's, of course, unfair,\nbut it relates to experience, right?\nThat is less maybe promoted\nor offered for females,\nso you get this peripheral pattern\ninstead of a central-generated pattern\nthat progresses towards the extremities.\nOne thing I wanted to ask you\nis I know an area that\nis not often mentioned\nis that some of these\nancient patterns and systems\nare primary in many ways,\nhence those newer\ndevelopments inside of us\nare constrained by using the connections\nrunning through these ancient systems.\nHence, we are much more limited\nby the gene pool.\nWe are hitchhikers on a\npiece of DNA, I like to say,\nand that gene pool is like is\ndriving something so primary\nthat even when you are in\nkind of the driver's seat\nin your eyes, you're actually not\nor you're being totally\nconstrained by that.\nAnd I wanted to hear about this.\n- Yeah, recently we had\na guest on the podcast\nnamed Erich Jarvis, he's a\nprofessor at Rockefeller,\nwho was offered a position to dance\nwith the Alvin Ailey dance company.\nSo, an accomplished dancer\nand comes from a musical family\nchose to become a\nneuroscientist instead and study\nspeech and language.\n- Wow.\nBut he said something incredible,\nseveral incredible things,\nand really looking forward to\ngetting your reflections on.\nFirst of all, he said that\nwhen you look at the species\nin the kingdom of animals, including us,\nthat have elaborate\nlanguage and true song,\nthey all also have the capacity to dance.\nAll the...\nIt turns out hummingbirds\nactually have a dance and a song capacity.\nThat perhaps, and this is the going idea\nnow in neuroscience and\nevolution of the brain,\nthat singing actually came before\nfinally articulated speech and language,\nthat voice involved first\nto sing, to communicate.\nI mean, to enunciate ugh, or uh, or mm.\nYou know, but then song\nmay have come first.\nWhere you have song, you have dance\nand the capacity to dance,\nwhich of course is movement of the body.\nAnd where you have song and dance,\nyou always find that those species\ncan generate elaborate language.\nNow, the simple version of this is okay,\nsophisticated brains\ntend to create clusters\nof sophisticated capabilities,\nbut the other possibility,\nand it's the one that Jarvis proposes\nand I think it's in line\nwith what you're perhaps raising here\nis the idea that movement of the body\nand range and sophistication\nof movement of the body\nthrough all these different systems\nmay have actually promoted\nor even driven the evolution\nof the things that we think\nof as speech and language\nand the ability to have multiple\nwords for the same concept,\nor to have elaborate\narticulation of speech.\nI find this incredibly\nattractive as an idea\nbecause certainly from\nas a hierarchy of needs,\nwe needed to move first to survive,\nand to mate, and to flee, and to attack.\nIt makes perfect sense\nto me that the layers\nwould be built up fundamentally\nfrom the body to the mind\nand not the other way around.\nSo, that's one piece,\nand then the other piece,\nwhich I'll just share for any\nreflections you might have\nthat just blew me away\nwas Jarvis told me that when we read,\nif, and this has been done experimentally,\nif one records the EMG,\nthe low level muscular activity\nin the larynx and pharynx,\nwe are actually repeating\nthe words that we read,\nbut so subtly so that we\ndon't actually speak them out,\nunless there's some sort\nof neurologic deficit,\nwhich some people have, some\npeople mumble while they read.\nBut what that tells me is\nthat language is movement\nand movement is language.\nSo, again, we have this convergence,\nbut at a very basic level\nI'd love your reflections\non those are all his ideas,\nI want to say, I'm just\nrepeating what he said\nand not nearly as precisely as he did,\nbut how do you think of movement\nas either the foundation of\nlanguage or as its own language\nthat perhaps even defies words?\n- Mm, [gasps].\nWow, those are beautiful perspectives,\nand I definitely feel the same.\nThere's a lot to say\nabout singing and dancing\nas well as also as a form\nof ancient programs of transmission.\nSometimes that there is this\nin some ancient practices, the mantras.\nAnd people don't realize\nthat they are tantric practices,\nthey contain a form of\nvibrating and breathing\nall tied together into very elaborate way\nto promote a certain effect.\nAnd how would you do something\nlike this in ancient times?\nThis is ingenious.\nWe, even until today,\nwe need a full book to describe something\nand it wouldn't work as well,\nso it's like a very ancient\nform of transmission.\nThe more accurate we\nbecame with the language,\nthe more dead it became,\nbecause it is less of a movement entity,\nit is less of a dynamic\nentity from its nature.\nAnd that's why Yukio Mishima\nsays, \"It's corrupting,\nit corrupts us.\"\nSo, definitely, definitely\nthe conducing force\nor the primary force for me is\nmovement that is experienced.\nEvery time we talk about movement,\nbasically, even now we are\nspilling it into a container\nto call it what it is,\nbut it is beyond that.\nSo, then it is applied into dancing,\ninto singing, into language.\nThere is no other language\nthat I see as a primary mode,\nand this is a nature of\nspace, time, things moving.\nSo, I think everything moves\ninto the direction of\nunderstanding that more and more,\nand maybe it's not so\npopular to call it movement\nor people have some connotations,\nand it's okay, you can\nthrow away this word\nand put another word, and\nwe probably need to do that\nalso like regularly,\nlike I start to see the\nend of this word for me.\nThings get corrupted\nagain, overused, abused,\nand then we need a new word.\nAnd that's even that word is\nonly needed for communication\nand for specific processes\nof education exchange,\nit's important to stay\nwithin the experiences.\nIt's important to continue\nto promote scenarios\nin which the experience is primary,\nmore open experience, let's say,\nand not try to hold down\nand define overly accurately\nor if it's done throwing\nit away and starting again.\nSo, there is no winning concept,\nyou got to the winning\nconcept, you got nothing.\nYou were able to grab\nit, you were able to,\nthis is very science, right?\nIt's like, \"We got it, we got it,\"\nand then it turns out to be nothing.\nAnd like more and more time passes\nI feel science is becoming more humble\nand things are being\ndiscussed in this way.\nAnd because really what does science do?\nReport the sun came up\na certain amount of billions of times\nand then tomorrow it will come up again.\nIt's statistics.\n- Yeah, it's good prediction.\n- Yeah, yeah, but we can go beyond,\nthere is something inside\nof us that can go beyond.\nHard to communicate, I can't\noffer it right now here,\nbut I have the experience and\nthankfully I have a practice\nand a way to sense it, to\nfeel it, and to reexamine it,\nand then we can talk about it,\nand have something from that.\n- Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist,\nhe actually founded the\nfield of sociobiology,\nE. O. Wilson, they call\nhim, Edward Wilson,\nhad this beautiful word\nand indeed named a book.\nActually, the word was better\nthan the book, sorry Wilson,\nbut the book was a little\nbit meandering for my taste,\nbut then, again, he's the\nHarvard professor, not me.\nWell, Stanford's pretty darn good.\nThis word is consilience,\nthis idea of a leaping together\nof divergent forms of knowledge\nto create a truly valuable\nconcept, which I love.\nI love it because, of\ncourse, I'm formally trained\nas a scientist, I look at things\nmainly through the lens of neuroscience,\nbut experience is real\nand observation is real.\nAnd even in the field of medicine,\nyou have double-blind\nplacebo-controlled clinical trials\nand then you have case\nstudies, n-of-1, right?\nNot often discussed,\nright, I mean, H.M.,\nthe most famous example in neuroscience\nof a patient that had no hippocampus\ninformed us more about\nthe process of memory\nand indeed the function of the hippocampus\nthan thousands of independent\nexperiments that followed.\nSo, you can't have one,\nyou need all these different\nforms of exploration,\nwhich is I think we share the belief,\nif I may, that convergent\nforms of knowledge,\neventually this process of consilience\ncan eject a new concept.\nAnd yet, the challenge,\nagain, is that if we don't\nhave a language for it,\nit becomes hard to transmit.\nOne of the things that I find incredibly,\nI'll use this word again, sticky\nis this notion of movement culture.\nI don't know who coined that phrase,\nor I've seen it in the circles\nand accounts around your\nInstagram account and others.\nI don't know if that's a\nphrase that you coined,\nbut this idea of engaging in\nmovement practice with others,\nwhether or not it's dance\nor other movement practices\nbecause it's so dynamic, there's\nthe unpredictability of it.\nEven to like today,\ntwo practitioners at vastly\ndifferent levels of knowledge\nand experience in movement practice,\nthere's information, I\nlike to think, to be gained\nfrom both sides. [laughs]\nSo-\n- 100%.\nSo, one thing that I've\nheard you say before,\nwhich really resonated with me\nis this idea that people have\nmaybe particularly in the US\nhave this concept of, \"Oh,\nI have my yoga friends\nor the people I dance with are distinct\nfrom my family friends,\nare distinct from.\"\nBut as you pointed out,\ngathering around movement\nis an age-old tradition.\nAnd that perhaps we\nbetter off not thinking\nabout people we exercise\nwith or train with,\nbut that friendship and\nconnection made through movement\nis perhaps the most\nvaluable form of connection.\n- Yeah, I think it's a\nproduct of those practices\nthat are maybe not so aware\nor not so movement-oriented\nin the open sense\nand then you get this\nsensation with people,\nbut alone, we do nothing,\nso much so that we're never alone\nalso on the inside and we will manufacture\nand produce entities inside,\nso we're constantly\nin a dynamic exchange, cultural exchange.\nAnd practically, I learned\nthis lesson in capoeira,\nit's a cultural manifestation.\nThings happen within this context,\nwe rub against reality,\nwe rub against each other\nand their movement occurs\nand their insight is to be\ngained and development happens\nand then comes other thoughts,\ncollective knowledge\nversus self-knowledge.\nWe are transmitting knowledge.\nIf we go on top of some mountain,\n20 people, 20 normal individuals,\nand we spent 20 years\njust fighting four hours in the morning,\nfour hours in the afternoon,\nand we do it for 20 years,\nbut we're isolated from any\nother source of knowledge,\nwe would still not reach anything\nthat a very young fighter these days has.\nWe will be unable to develop\nthose techniques, those insights,\nthat's where collective knowledge comes in\nand transmission jumps us forward,\nbut what is the problem with that?\nStaying within just those\ntechnical constraints\nand never making it yours,\nthat's the part of self-knowledge.\nThe digestion of this\ncollective information\nuntil it becomes digested and\nbecomes part of yourselves,\nand then you are it\nversus you are doing it.\nAnd this is a clear separation\nthat you can see in sports\non a very high level and\non a not so high level,\neven though I would be honest\nif I say that some people reach very far\njust with collective knowledge\nand a very technical approach,\nand others reach extremely\nfar with very little of it.\nAnd there is always outliers,\nthere are always the\noutliers in that case.\nAnother thought I had when\nyou mentioned evo-devo,\nevolution development is\nalso the Greek concepts\nof poiesis and physis.\nThe growing of the seed into the tree,\nand the other process\nof the manufacturing of\nthe chair from the tree.\nTwo processes of development\nevolution, very different.\nOne from everything to something,\nthe other from nothing to something.\nOne is accumulation based,\none is subtraction based.\nBoth of these processes relate\nto collective knowledge,\nself-knowledge, but they're\nnot exactly just that.\nAnd what should we do?\nThis is a question that my friend Rasmus,\nhe asks in his thesis and thoughts,\nwhat is the ultimate for us?\nShould we manufacture our chair\nor should we grow like into the tree?\nCivilize the mind, leave savage the body.\nIs it in this way or should\nthe mind also be left wild?\nWild and wise is a nice\ncombination of words\nthat I like to place together, wild, wise.\nSo, this is something that I try to bring\ninto the way that I live\nmy life and my practice.\nAnd I try to bring the information,\nand the wisdom, and the\ncollective knowledge,\nbut I also try to let go of more and more\nuntil an essence is gleaned,\nuntil something is appearing\nand because everything was already there.\nFor example, if I'm sitting here,\nall the movements are already occurring,\nall the possibilities are.\nSo, it's just about, I need to open,\nI open this window, the\nair would come from here.\nIf I open this window, the air would come.\nI don't need to drive my motion,\nI need to discover what is\nstopping it from happening.\nSomething is constantly holding,\nand when we remove this\nimmediately movement appears,\nthis is real deep movement\nversus the driven movement\nthat is a very wasteful\nof times like walking,\nyou see people pushing through the walk\ninstead of the controlled\nfalling that it should be.\nFighting, punching to\nmanufacture the strength\nand then to have someone who knows\nhow to facilitate the conditions\nin which you are knocked out.\nIt doesn't knock you out,\n\"It hits versus I hit,\"\nlike Bruce Lee said.\nSo, this is a beautiful thing to examine\nand to work within that,\nso it's to see am I skateboarding?\nAm I using this perspective?\nOr am I trying to, to control\nbecause of risk and danger,\nI'm trying to overly control something\nthat actually can never be controlled.\nThe way to control it is\nto let go of the control\nand then, okay, but what\nabout all this collection\nof information, knowledge\nthat I can bring in?\nWhere do I want to play?\nI can play down here\nor I can play up here.\nThe collective knowledge is\nmaybe take you further in,\nand then you're still going\nneed to do your individual work.\nA lot of people like\nto romanticize on that\nand it's you don't need\nteachers, we don't need nothing,\nwe don't need information.\nIt's not fully honest, you don't need,\nbut depends on where you want to function\nand how you want to function.\nThey shouldn't be demonized,\nbut they shouldn't be\noverly glorified as well.\n- You mentioned about the\nopportunity for movement,\nperhaps even all forms of\nmovement coming from deep within,\nit raises to mind in the\nneuroscience of motor systems\nwe talk about motor\nneurons, as I described,\nthe ones that actually evoke\ncontraction of muscles.\nAnd then, there's this category of neurons\nthat isn't often discussed,\nbut certainly exist.\nAren't often discussed\nin kind of popular\nnomenclature of neuroscience,\nwhich is the pre-motor system.\nMost of our movements are the reflection\nof certain patterns of transmission\nbreaking through from the\npre-motor to the actual motor.\nIn other words, we are always\nin a anticipatory mode of movement.\nAnd as and I think you,\nthe way you describe it,\nyou clearly intuitively understand this,\nyou feel it, and you recognize it.\nAnd think of it as it's\nlike a layer of neurons\nthat's constantly humming\n[hums] ready to go.\nAnd it's the release of these gates\nthat allows movement to\noccur in a particular way,\ncould be very smooth,\ncould be very ballistic.\n- Which is DNA, the same,\nturning off and on, all the\ninformation is already there.\n- Right.\n- And then the possibilities\nare just allowed.\nSo, I'm allowed,\nI don't do free will already,\nbut I am allowed to do, I am.\nThere are possibilities\nand I am dancing within that dance,\nbut I am not the only dancer.\nSo, that's, that's my sensation\nat least with most\nstates of being, let's say.\nMaybe there is other states\nthat could be reached,\na stability that will\narrive from the waters,\nfrom the movement of the waters,\nthis humming, these\npotential possibilities\nto be in that state,\nto vibrate like this is\nvery powerful for our lives.\nTo wake up in the morning\nand feel that living thing\nis the feeling of movement,\nand, for me, it's a\nresult of the practice.\nAnd so, then it's easy not to stagnate\nand then the mind can\nstay focused for hours\nlike we've done today,\nand I can listen and tune\nin and I won't lose you.\nWhich is very difficult,\nlike I haven't had a good conversation\nhere in the US it's very difficult,\nand I've had your attention\nand you're listening,\nbut it's rare.\nIt's rare that somebody can do that,\nand it's a struggle, always a struggle,\nbut it's definitely my\ntrick, my dirty trick.\n- In that you said you're allowed\nand, again, I'm taking\nsome of the language\nand what you report about your experience\nand I'm trying to map it to some concepts\nthat relate to neural circuits.\nIn the principles of neuroscience,\nwe talk about instructiveness\nversus permissiveness.\nThere are instructive cues,\nlike for instance, the ability\nto pick up this pen, right?\nThere's an instruction, clearly\nthere's a motor command,\nbut that's just one way of looking at it.\nThe way it actually works\nis that there's a pre-motor system\nthat's already generating that movement,\nand what we've done is\nwe've flung open the gate\nand allowed that movement\nto occur precisely.\n- Surfing it.\n- Right.\n- Surfing that current,\nor this current, or another current,\nor opening the window.\n- Exactly, and if you\nlook at the formal study\nof movement and improvement of movement,\nthe most basic example I can\ngive is like a tennis serve.\nAnd they, if you just,\nand they've done this many times over.\nYou map the trajectories,\nand in a novice the lines\nare all over the place,\nit ends up looking more like a tangle\nof rubber band ball, right?\nWhereas in the Federer or the expert,\nyou almost wonder if it's\njust one line being drawn,\nbut it's the trajectories\nare incredibly stereotyped.\nThat's the reflection of\none little narrow gate\nopening again, and again, and again.\nOf course-\n- Let me inject\nsomething here from an old\nneurologist, you can say,\nBernstein, the Soviet.\nAnd he talked about degrees of freedom,\nand they did in order\nto increase productivity\nin Soviet Union.\nI don't know if you\nyou've heard this story.\n- [Andrew] No.\n- He was brought in to\nexamine the movement habits\nof the workers and he\ncollected some information.\nHe placed, he was one\nof the first kinetic,\nI don't know how it's called in English,\nthe kinetic capturing of motion\nwith moving pictures in that time.\nAnd so, he placed these dots\nand they took these photos,\nwhich became kind of moving.\nAnd what he discovered was\nsomething very interesting,\nthe accuracy of the\nheat of the sledgehammer\nincreased while the variants\nin the various points\nbecame more, not less.\nSo, it wasn't a fixed pattern,\nit was a meta pattern.\nAnd this pattern is adjusted\nin this way to achieve\nthe perfect execution.\nThose were very early findings,\nand I'm not sure how does\nthat sit with everything,\nbut I'm sure there is some\ntruth to it from my experience.\nBasically, the self-adjusting\ndynamic nature of the system\nallows you to reach a very constant\nand stable end result by being so open\nand letting go of your control.\n- Mm-hmm, the example\nyou give fits very well\nwith the one that I described before\nbecause and I'm recalling the experiment.\nIf people want to look\nthis up, it's a paper,\nwe'll put it in the show note caption,\na guy also happens to be at Harvard\nnamed Bence Ölveczky, a Hungarian,\nI'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong,\nbut I know Bence.\nAnd I remember the slide in my mind's eye,\nand the trajectory that was mapped\nwas the movement of the tennis racket,\nnot of the limbs themselves\nin the Federer case.\nSo, that I think aligns well\nwith what you're describing.\nYeah, that exploration\nof degrees of freedom\nis where the opportunity\nfor real advancement\nand expansion of skill shows up.\nAs that I think the way\nit's been described to me\nis that we go from unskilled to skilled\nand then there's mastery,\nand then there's this top tier,\nwhich is this beautiful, thin layer\nthat so few people occupy,\nwhich is virtuosity,\nin which the practitioner\ninvites variability\nand chance back in as an\nopportunity to do truly new things.\n- It made me think many years ago,\nthis kind of thinking about\nso what is that entity?\nBecause obviously, it's not technique,\nand it wouldn't even be honest\nto say it's a movement pattern,\nthere is too much diversity there.\nI started to talk about,\nI called it movement\nsleeves or meta technique,\nbut the word technique\nis already misleading.\nSo, there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve\nin which you can move in\nas long as you are not out of this sleeve,\nyou are still within the boundaries\nof achieving the result that you're after.\nAnd then, the result is adaptation\nof all these elements inside\nto keep you in the sleeve.\nThe sleeve is not constricted\nas we once thought,\n\"Oh, beautiful technique.\"\nThere are many ways to skin a cat,\nand that experience, and\nthat variety, that diversity\ngoes into virtuosity.\nIt's true freedom because your\nfocus is on the right thing.\nYou don't point at the\nmoon, look at your finger,\nand that's really in\nessence being a virtuoso,\nfor me, like mastery, let's\nsay if there is such a thing.\n- Oh, there's I do believe\nthere is such a thing\nand I'll flatter and\nattempt to embarrass you\nby saying I think that I'm not alone\nin viewing you as a virtuoso of movement.\nI think that's what comes to mind\nbecause there's this notion\nthat not everything is pre-planned,\nthat even you might not know\nwhat you're going to do next\nuntil the moment of execution,\nbut that here I'm projecting\nmy own assumptions.\nI'd like to talk about mindsets\nin approaching practice a little bit more,\nbut I want to wade into that territory\nby talking about vision in the eyes,\nsomething that we both\nshare a deep interest in.\nI from the background\nof visual neuroscience,\nbut also from the realization\nthat we have this incredible ability\nto adjust the aperture\nof our visual window,\nwe can focus very narrowly\nand we can focus very broadly.\nSo, something I encountered,\nI think first as a child,\nrealizing that I could spend all day\nwatching ants play in a very fine domain\nand then look up and go inside\nand realize there's a whole\nworld and realizing, \"Wow,\nI'll never be able to consume\nthe full range of experiences\nat any one moment.\"\nThere are ants probably\nin the corner of this room\ndoing their thing.\nAnd so too our approach to movement\ncan be, as you mentioned,\nvery big and dynamic\nin terms of the broad movements\nof our limbs or fine articulation.\nWhen you begin a practice\nand as you move through a practice,\ndo you apply a regimented\nway of focusing your vision?\nAre you in panoramic vision?\nAre you in a very narrow field of view?\nOr does it entirely depend?\nAnd for the person who's a true beginner,\na true novice, like myself,\nhow should I show up to\nthe practice with my eyes?\n- The eyes are a good starting point\nas you help a lot of people to understand.\nAnd when you encounter\ndifficulties with other layers,\nit's very powerful to start with the eyes.\nAnother thing important to understand\nand to experience, you can't believe me,\nor you've got to examine it for yourself,\nwe do not move the eyes\nas well as we think we do.\n'Cause as long as you can\nsee and move the eyes,\npeople never think about\nit, that it can be trained,\nthat it can be improved, et cetera,\nand the effects of it are far reaching.\nThe eyes lead to the inner eye,\nyou can think of it in a\nbeautiful metaphorical way.\nAnd it's a representation of the way\nthat we use various\ncognitive and mind processes\nand also, of course, affect the body.\nThe eyes lead in many ways\nand the head is also a very\nbecause all of these inputs\nare coming in here.\nSo, it's very easy to lead the body\nand if you look at it\ncentrally from the head,\nit's a very powerful and easy thing.\nFor example, when you\nteach boxers how to bob,\nusually it's not done\nin the way that I believe\nit should be done,\nyou teach it with the periphery.\nThey teach it from the feet\nbecause they have the\nidea, which is correct,\nthat you need to do it\nin spatial conditions,\nin movement, in space.\nBut in reality, the head will\norganize the feet for you.\nInstead, you are now putting\ntwo elements together\nand then with years of practice,\nyou hope of tying them together well.\nI prefer to do something else\nbecause if I'll pull\nyour head now to side,\nyou will immediately start to\norganize your feet under you.\nSo, I give you just one element\nto manipulate the system from,\nthat's how I would teach\nsomeone something like this.\nMany animals hunt with the head,\nso you can see the body running forward\nwhile the head is turning to the side,\nthe whole thing follows afterwards.\nSo, it's a very powerful\nway to address movement,\nnot the only one,\nthere are many modes, thankfully,\nand we're very adaptable in that,\nbut definitely a primary one.\nAnd then, the use of\nthe eyes is, of course,\nmaybe the most important\nelement with that usually.\nYeah, what else can I say about the eyes?\nSo, how do you come in?\nWell, it depends on the practice,\nyou need to start to have\nsome kind of a checklist\nof what you're looking to do.\nAnd then by this,\nyou can start to tailor the\nway that you use your eyes.\nThe same thing I do for posture,\nthe same thing I do for stance,\nthe same thing eventually I do for state.\nAnd there is different flavors,\nthere is no correct way to use the eyes.\nSometimes it's very peripheral,\nsoft, open awareness orientation,\nsometimes it's very focused.\nNotice that I'm pulling\nthese two opposites,\nawareness and focus,\nwhich is often put together and fused,\nbut and then the eyes\nare like the immediate\nand the easiest entry point into that.\nAnother thing is the placement\nof the head and the eyes,\nlike for example, when we lower our chin,\nwe seem to see better.\nWhen we raise the eyebrows,\nthere is too much exposure\nof top light sources\nand so people would usually\nwhen looking into the distance\nwill tilt their chin in.\nAnd in many scenarios, tilting\nof the chin to the side,\nor placing just like\nlistening with the ear,\nplacing a certain eye or dominant eye,\ndepending on various scenarios.\nAnd this is all like information\nthat I can come in cerebrally,\nand think about, and\njump my practice forward.\nInstead, of just letting the\nexperience teach me that,\nI'm using some kind of a\nthinking process to improve.\nAnd this is not cheating, this is great.\nWill it work?\nWe got to try, it's a process.\nAnd those are some thoughts\nand to start to play with.\n- Yeah, I love that\nyou mentioned chin down\nbecause we all have a natural reflex\nwhen chin goes down, eyes goes up,\nand the opposite is true when\nhead goes up, eyes go down.\nAnd there are two separate\nclusters of neurons\nin these cranial nerve\nnuclei that, as we call them,\nwhen eyes are up,\nit increases our level\nof alertness overall.\nThis is not woo science,\nthis is the function of\nthese cranial nerve nuclei.\nWhen our eyes are down,\nwe go into states of\nmore calm and quiescence.\nAnd this makes perfect sense,\nyou know, and then the\neyelids usually go down\nand then people fall asleep.\nEyes up does not mean head up\n'cause, as you said, there's\na very dynamic control\nover the amount of luminance\ndepending on the environment.\nSo, that and then, as you mentioned,\nthis difference between\nfocus and awareness,\nI think is a really important one.\nWhen we are in this more\npanoramic, soft gaze\nand broad awareness, big swaths\nof visual field, as we say,\nthe neurons that control that\ncome through a pathway\ncalled magnocellular pathway.\nIn any event, those\nneurons are much thicker,\nthicker cables, they transmit much faster,\njust like thick pipes can\ncarry more water more quickly.\nAnd your reaction time\nis at least four times\nwhat it is in this awareness mode\nthan it is when you're\nnarrowly focused on something.\nAnd this is counterintuitive,\nI think, to a lot of people,\nbut the person who is\nrunning to catch the ball\nis not tracking the ball\nin a smooth movement,\nmost of their vision is\nin peripheral vision.\nWhen we drive we're in\nthis peripheral vision\nand our reaction times\nare much, much faster.\nSo, I don't know if I'm\nreluctant to encourage people\nto shift toward a\nparticular type of practice\ntoward a particular type of vision.\nI think what you and I,\nI hope agree on, correct me if I'm wrong,\nis that exploring these different extremes\nand everything in between\nis where the real value is.\nPanoramic focused,\neyes, head up, eyes down,\nhead down, eyes up,\nplaying with it and exploring it\nand as opposed to for the\nfirst 10 minutes of practice\nbeing panoramic vision.\nYou know, the sort of-\n- Yeah.\n- earlier today we were joking\nabout and kind of lamenting the fact\nthat this word biohacking exists\nor that the optimal performance,\nit's that they're unfortunate terms\nbecause they suggest that\nif you just plug it in,\nit's going to be like\ntwo plus two equals four\nand you're going to get\nit right every time.\n- Another pragmatic bit\nhere, if I can offer,\nis since our culture\nhas been more geared and\npushing us towards focus,\nthe focus use of the eyes,\nand primary language,\nreading, and other things,\nwe have less opportunities\nto work with the more open panoramic one.\nSo, it would be smart\nto start to balance things out a bit more.\nWhen you're in nature, you\ndon't look at each leaf,\neverything is moving, and you\nare kind of immersed in that.\nAnd then, something\nattracts your attention,\n\"Oh, it's a bird,\" and you focus,\nand you go back into the general state,\nthe base state, which is open awareness.\nHere, we switch things\naround in our modern culture,\nwe are mostly focused and\nthen we sometimes daydream,\nwhich is maybe some kind\nof a balancing act\nthat comes from deep within,\nI don't know, maybe you can share\nsome information about that,\nbut I see that many time people need to,\nthe focus is overly done\nby far in our lives.\n- I couldn't agree more,\nand I think a lot of I'll\neven venture so far as to say\nthat a lot of the visual deficits\nthat we now see in young people,\nmyopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs\nbecause if we look at things\nthat are too close to us\nas children or as adults,\nthe eyeball actually gets longer.\nThe lens focuses the visual image in front\nof nearer to the lens, nearsighted,\nthan in front of where it should land.\nAnd basically, it's a\nlack of panoramic vision\nthat is or open awareness\nthat's driving these changes.\nAnd nowadays, we are essentially,\nmost people are 90% of the\ntime in this narrow focus mode.\nYou know, right before recording,\nwe took a break and went\nup to look at a vista\nand to look off to the\ndistance, incredibly useful,\neasy practice at some level,\nbut I think most people are\nnot doing this sort of thing.\nAnd the way that it shapes the mind\nand the perception of time,\nof course, is a whole\nother kingdom of ideas.\nBut one thing I'd like to relate\nthis element of vision\nto and open awareness\nis earlier you mentioned the\ncone of auditory attention,\nthe other sense that we can play with\nin as in our practice\nand throughout the day.\nDo you see any value to both\npaying attention to things\nin a very narrow cone\nof auditory attention,\nbut also just walking and listening\nto all the sounds at once?\nI could imagine that could be useful.\nAnd in terms of physical\nmovement practices,\nI was going to say where are your ears?\nYour ears are always more\nor less in the same place,\nbut where is your hearing when\nyou approach your practice?\n- Another set of\nparameters to think about,\nand to play with, and to be aware of.\nAlso, I have the\nexperience that some people\nare better at using this\nsystem or that system.\nAnd you would be amazed how\ndifferently the same results\nseemingly outside results are done\nby different practitioners\nand different scenarios.\nThis goes into this\nmutation and change idea\nis what really jumps us forward eventually\nsome kind of a mutation.\nSo, it's like all of our culture,\nand practices, and success\nputs us closer and closer to each other,\nso we have the same opinions\neverywhere around the world\nbecoming more and more the same,\nless and less different,\nbut the real hope comes\nfrom the different,\nso and we have a difficulty\nin promoting that.\nAnd so, this is another\nthing that can be promoted\nwith the right practices,\nthe right, for example,\nI work with corporates\nor even worked with governments before\nto bring in some of that freshness\nwith simple habits in the workday,\nor in the education of children,\nor in companies increasing productivity.\nI don't really give a fuck,\nbut I am there to give\nwhat I view is important\nand what is important maybe\nincreases productivity,\nbut it's more important to me\nthat it improves people's\nlives who are involved\nand improves, yeah, being and becoming,\nbeing and becoming, these two entities.\nI'm not there, I'm on\nmy way, I'm a process.\nSo, thinking about hearing,\nthe way that people use their ears,\nthe way that people use listening.\nAgain, we can talk about\nplacement of the head and posture,\nsometimes angling as well,\nsharper angle, chin down,\nsome people tend to use\nthe shape of the ear,\npeople with different ears\ncloser or further out.\nThis is it's if you're very sensitive\nand you're looking around,\nyou would see this is\naffecting people's motion.\nEven the shape of our face,\nlike the development of the vocal chords\nand speaking will totally\nchange how we are, how we look,\nbut how we listen also will do the same.\nI don't have any proof of it,\nbut it is something I believe in.\n- Well, people will even make\ntheir ears bigger, right?\nWe, we try and become like\nlittle fennec foxes or something\nby, I mean, a lot of people don't realize\nthat's actually why we do this\nis to capture more sound waves, right?\nAnd the leaning is that\nthe localization of sound\nis based on a simple brainstem calculation\nof interaural time differences,\nthe time in which something,\nthe brain intuitively, it just knows\n'cause it's a pretty hardwired circuit\nthat if a sound arrives first\nto this ear then that ear,\nthat it's likely coming from over here.\nWhereas, if it's dead center,\narrives at the two at the same time,\nthat it's almost ridiculously\nsimple when one hears it,\nno pun intended,\nbut it is an incredibly\nvaluable way of thinking\nabout how the architecture of the body\nchanges our experience.\nAlong those lines earlier,\nyou mentioned something\nand it flagged an\nimportant question for me.\nWhen I see people walking\nsometimes I think, \"Wow, they\nreally move in a strange way.\"\nOccasionally you see somebody,\nthey walk really, it's\nimpressive for whatever reason,\nyou know, and you just think, \"Wow,\nthey sort of glide along.\"\nPeople come in different shapes and sizes,\nshort torsos, long arms, et cetera.\nDo you think that if\npeople have a body type\nthat facilitates certain kinds\nof movement and not others\nthat they should intentionally\ntry and move in the way\nthat is right at the edge\nof the kind of friction and challenge\nin order to shape new possibilities,\nor do you think that they should lean\ninto the smooth execution\nof what comes most naturally to them?\n- Yeah, I think a good\npractice is to have many walks\nbecause they're required.\nAnd, of course, there is a very efficient\nand endurance, stamina-oriented thing\nthat if you have the experience,\nit will naturally develops and unravel.\nAnd if not,\nyou can get some collective\nknowledge and improve.\nAnd then there is a lot of emotion,\nemotional things related to walk\nlike how I'm walking\ninto a business meeting\nand/or how I'm walking\nout of a bad situation.\nAnd there is a lot of beautiful\nthings to research there\npractically with yourself,\ntrying to approach someone\nwith the chin slightly down,\nvery linear, very efficient\nin the straightest line,\nor trying to approach someone\na little bit more rounded\nfrom the side and tilting your head,\nand you will see totally\ndifferent results,\ntotally different\ncommunication that happens\nover people's heads.\nBut if you're sensitive,\nyou realize that, \"Wow,\nthis opened the door.\"\nInstead, many people\nyou start on the minus.\nMy sister, my big sister, Atali,\nshe always says, \"I started on the minus,\nwhy don't I start on zero with them?\"\nYou know, so, but it's\npart of the approach.\nYou can affect that, and you\ncan start even on the plus\nif you are the sly man as\nthe practitioner needs to be.\nSo, this is something to\nplay with and to work with\nand then you have, of\ncourse, body proportions,\nand ways, and we have all\nthese like technical invasions,\nmathematics, and trigonometry,\nand architecture,\nthey invaded our bodies, they\ninvaded our nervous system.\nAnd now, our walk and\nour physical practices,\nthey look linear and efficient,\nthe path between two\npoints is a straight line,\nit's not, this is biomechanics,\nit's not mechanics,\nnothing there is a given,\nthere's no gospel.\nSo, the walkers is\nsometimes have to go around\nor sway from side to side,\nand there is coiling and coiling\nand there are moving bits.\nAnd what about the coordination\nof my breathing with my walk?\nBecause if I walk too linearly,\nthere is less pumping of\nthe air naturally in and out\nso now I have to forcefully\nbring it in and out, I'm wasteful.\nAnd that's why you see in last years,\nthese incredible runners,\nespecially in long distance,\ndoing things we never\nthought were possible\nin the worst possible way\nthat we used to think,\npronation and all kinds of things\nlike our technical thoughts\nwere totally misguided and wrong.\nAnd then, somebody comes\nin and does it in some way\nthat is totally wrong\nand he gets results we could never get.\nAnd that's the beauty of playfulness,\nexperimentation, change, being different.\n- As you're describing this I'm smiling\nbecause one of my\nfavorite neuroscientists,\nhe's out of the university of Chicago,\nwas in a meeting and there was an argument\nabout evolution of the nervous system\nand he said, \"At the end,\"\nand people were arguing about\nwhether or not this gene\nin one animal was homologous\nto this gene in humans, et cetera,\nit can get very dicey.\nAnd he said very, very appropriately that,\n\"One of the major jobs of evolution\nis to take existing\ncell types and circuits\nand give them new functions.\nBut that can only be done\nthrough the playful exploration\nof new possibilities,\"\nwhich I think maps very\nwell to what you're saying,\nthat at the extreme thresholds\nof technical execution,\nyou know, mastery, mastery, mastery, you,\nyour obviously performance is very high,\nbut the opportunity for\nevolution of the sport,\nor the music, or the dance,\nor the intellectual endeavor\nis limited because you're\nnot introducing variability.\nIn the attempt to get proper execution,\nyou're limiting oneself.\n- Hence, I want to offer\nsomething that is relating to you.\nWe should be wary\nof defining the mechanisms\nand putting certain meaning\nwith certain processes and ways\nbecause just history and experience shows\nit doesn't work well for us most times,\nor it becomes like this\nmuch more elaborate thing\neven if we were somewhat\nin the right direction\nbecause even thinking\nthis way can offer a lot.\nLike for example, your advice\nabout heat, dopamine, light,\noffers a lot of benefit,\nbut also can create problems\nand it can enclose something\nwhich the improviser\nwill find, the MacGyvers, right?\nLike take a pink, some paper clip,\nand you make it into something great.\nAnd this is really our,\nwe are the biggest improvisers around\nlike that's what made\nus who we are, I think,\nand this is incredible\nwhat we can do with it.\nYou know, the Russian-American\nspace exploration story\nwith the space pen,\nfamous story about the\ndevelopment of the space pen.\n- I don't know.\n- It's a-\n- A space pen?\n- Yeah.\n- No, I don't know about this.\n- I think it's an urban myth.\nI don't know if it's true,\nbut I like it so I use it.\nWell, there was this, of\ncourse, a space competition\nand the Russians put the\nfirst animal in space\nand the first.\n- He was a macaque monkey\nor something like that, yeah.\n- Yeah.\nAnd then Laika, and they\nput the first Sputnik,\nthe satellite, and men in space,\nbut Americans took the man on the moon.\nAnd on the way a lot of\ntechnologies got developed\nand the Americans because\nof lack of gravity out there\ndeveloped the space pen\nwith a huge investment,\nthe Russians used a pencil.\n[Andrew laughing]\nSo, I don't know if it's true,\nI don't think it is,\nbut it represents something\nin the state of mind.\nLike you look at, for example,\nthe military equipment\nin Soviet equipment,\nit all can do multiple things\nand it means that it's heavier,\nit's less efficient, it's not as light,\nbut even the Navy SEALs\nwill still carry an AK\nwith certain conditions, why?\nBecause you can pour\na whole bucket of sand\ninto the mechanism and\nit will keep running\nwhile the most advanced\nGerman Heckler & Koch\nand accurate and light weapons,\nfor every grain can get\nstuck and overly specialized.\nAnd there is something about this openness\nthat we humans need to keep,\nand also maybe something for our leaders\nto be more of less specialists\nand more in this openness,\nless capable in this or that way,\nbut more capable of doing the whole thing.\n- I love the story, whether\nor not it's a legend or not,\nit's legendary because it's fantastic.\nAs you say, in the laboratory,\nwhenever someone takes\non a project in my lab,\nI always say, \"You know,\nyou have to ask yourself\nhow much technical detail and\nchallenge you want to take on\nbecause with more technology,\nadvanced technology,\nyes, there's the opportunity\nfor more discovery,\nbut more downtime.\nYour PhD will literally take longer\nif you're going to use a microscope\nthat's out of commission 30% of the time,\nand you just have to understand that.\"\nSo, there's a dynamic interplay there.\n- By the way, I think that\nscientists get it right,\nit's where you transmit the knowledge\nout of the scientific field\nbecause science have\ndebate and everything,\nyou're not so connected,\nof course this can happen as well,\nbut then when it goes out\nand the simple person\nwithout the experience\ntakes it more as a\ngospel, as a fixed thing,\nand then it was just a report.\n- Right.\n- It was just reporting\nsome functions here and play with it,\nsee what it does for you.\nBecause with all the greatest\ninformation that I can give,\nthe person will examine it\nand it might be not useful at all for him.\nThis is the practitioner,\nmake it your own,\ngo practice, try heat, cold, light,\nmovement, awareness to\nthis, awareness to this.\nAnd this is up to you to make it yours,\nbut we don't like to\nhave this responsibility.\n- No, people prefer to have\nthat this will work the\nfirst time every time\nand will serve you best\ncompared to everything else.\nAnd while there are more\nreliable tools than others,\nin my mind, the more reliable tools\ntend to be ones that are\ngrounded in our innate physiology\nas opposed to some, I\ndon't like the word hack,\nin fact, I loathe the word biohack,\nas we were talking about again earlier,\nbecause a hack in my mind is something\nthat is designed for one purpose\nthat's used for another,\nit's not the most\nefficient use of that tool,\nnor is it naturally the best solution.\nWhereas, biology has\nsome very good solutions,\nbut they don't always\nwork, not every time.\nEarlier today, we did a practice\nin which involved a invasion,\nshall we say, of peripersonal space.\nWe weren't standing super close\nfor any particular reason,\nbut there was God forbid-\n- God forbid.\n- But there was we were\nclose enough together\nwe could touch one torsos\nand we were doing that\nas part of this practice.\nAnd you encouraged me to pay attention\nto how does it feel\nto have someone in your\nperipersonal space?\nAnd then, this notion of reactivity.\nI find this an immensely interesting\nand potentially powerful practice\nbecause I think a lot of people,\nI know a lot of people suffer from anxiety\njust being in a face-to-face conversation.\nSome people have a lot of anxiety\nabout being physically close to people,\nwhether or not they know them or not.\nAnd many people are reactive,\nthey are in that anticipatory state\nof something that is going to happen.\nAnd sometimes this relates to trauma\nand negative experience, but sometimes no,\nsometimes they're just not\nused to being in dynamic,\nexcuse me, exchange with other beings.\nAnd so, one thing that I love\nabout the movement practice\nand how dynamic is that\none can explore that space.\nMaybe you could talk about\nthat a little bit more.\n- Yeah.\nTouch, proximity, all these things,\nalso taking very,\nit takes a very, I think,\nlimited place in our lives.\nPeople are not touched and\nthey don't touch enough.\nThere is certain bubbles\nof peripersonal space\naccording to culture,\naccording to environment,\nwhat is right, what is wrong?\nAnd then came all the, of\ncourse, political correctness,\nand harassments, and all kinds.\nAnd this is a problem,\nit's a problem to navigate\nall this scenario.\nAnd I think we are,\nthere is definitely this\nside which is suffering.\nPeople go to BJJ classes to touch,\nnot to learn BJJ.\nMost of it, they're not even aware of it,\nbefore they would go\nto a prostitute, maybe.\nIt would not be honest to say that,\nyeah, this is not required or\nnecessary more in our lives.\nChildren who are not touched,\nthere is a lot of information\nabout that and the problems,\nbut adults who are not touched,\nthere is not a lot of information.\nAnd I think it's no less of a problem\nbecause it's something that\nhas to be constantly present.\nAnd then, proximity being\nable to, as you said,\nremove certain reactivity\nand to learn to control\nthat volume control\nover how reactive I am,\nand in other scenarios,\nhow do I remove this reactivity altogether\nis very important for performance\nand also for our lives for\nclear thinking, et cetera,\nbecause everything is moving through us\nand is being monitored by us\nso everything has the\npotential to detract us\nfrom a certain direction of exploration\nor and if you're reactive, you're a slave,\nand it becomes worse and worse and worse.\nOr as, for example, a fighter,\nor a football player, et cetera,\nhas to know what to\ntake, what not to take.\nThe fact that you can sense more\ndoesn't mean you should react to it.\nAnd the practice helps that\nby bringing people into these scenarios,\nbut oftentimes disarming them.\nLike when we were working closely today,\nand because you have a certain background\nwith boxing or fighting,\nI can tell you, you are\nmissing some kind of a way\nto be in that space that is not marshaled.\nSo, you carry a certain tone,\nalthough you're a very kind person,\nbut oftentimes you held me\nwithout realizing you're holding\nme with a lot of strength,\nfor example, and it just,\nit was clear to me you're not fully aware\nof what is unfolding\nand it's just, of course,\na question of experience.\nSo, to be able to be in this scenario,\nbut do something else,\nwhich is not geared towards\nwinning, losing competition,\nor just being able to\nplay with another person.\nLike for example, contact\nimprovisation took that\nand played with that,\nand the work of Steve Paxton\nfor the ones who are not familiar.\nSo, this is where I call it the hybrids\nbecome very useful,\nlike we don't when you are\npracticing in this open way,\nyou are not bound by specific rule set\nor ways of doing things.\nIt can be a fight, but it can be a dance\na moment after.\nAnother thing that I learned from capoeira\nthe situation's very tricky there\n'cause I've seen kids\ndoing cartwheels in Brazil\nand scissors fall from their pocket.\nWhy, why would you go to with\na scissor in your pocket?\nObviously, there is certain intentions\nand then at other times you see back flips\nand beautiful things, but people\ndie in capoeira every year.\n- Neck breaks or something?\n- Kicks through the face\nfrom various violence.\nIt's I've explored other\nmartial arts and boxing,\nI was involved with MMA and BJJ,\nbut I tell you the most violent arenas\nis that vibe 'cause it's unknown.\nOne moment, it smiles,\nanother moment, it's something\nelse and it's uncontrolled.\nThere is no categories, no weights,\nand it's a street phenomenon.\nSo, you have musical instruments,\nsometimes they break it on your head.\nPeople don't see that,\nbut you can look online on YouTube\nand see some of that side of capoeira,\nwhich is actually the day-to-day in Brazil\nand the reality and how things unfolded.\nSo, it's very important to explore\nmany ways of being within\ndifferent distances and spaces\nfrom other people and\ntouched in different ways\nand not contextualizing\nit always in the same way.\nI can touch your chest in one way,\nI can touch it with the exact\nsame pressure and speed,\nbut it will feel very different.\nThe parameters, I'm not\nsure, certain intentions,\ncertain combination of postures or ways,\nand this is beautiful exploration.\nAnd again, I would\nencourage you and others\nto explore the discomfort.\nFor example, certain\ndiscomfort to be with a man\nin a certain scenario or with a woman\nand trying to see what is that?\nBecause if we're truly strong,\nwe are not afraid of anything.\nIf we truly know who we are\nand we are in that exploration,\nwe don't know the end result,\nbut we are in a research\nand then we are not afraid\nof being in debt or this,\nand we don't come out of boundaries,\nand this will improve\nour culture tremendously.\nOf course, there must be agreement,\nyou never force yourself,\nbut you meet someone\nwho is also interested\nin that exploration and then you do it.\nAnd there are many scenarios\nto do that with traditional practices,\nlike learning to grapple\nor going to contact improvisation\nand studying there, or going to dance,\nto Latin dance class\nor and there is, of course, my favorite\nis to create and to come\nup with your own hybrids\nof that and scenarios.\nCommunicating with your\nloved one through movement,\nnot sitting around food and talking,\nmoving together in all kinds of ways.\nSometimes it's walking together,\nbut sometimes it's all\nkinds of, it can be game,\nplayful, it can be romantic.\nAnd there are many shades,\nsex doesn't start here\nand end here, right?\nIt's like a continuum,\nand we don't even need\nto define it in that way.\nSo, with time, I think it unlocks\na lot of things.\nPeople become much\nstronger in a good sense,\nin sense of becoming, being,\nand we abuse less, and we can approach,\nyeah, other aspects to us.\n- I love the idea that\nthrough the exploration\nof a range of physical contacts\nprovided one knows they can always return\nto their center, so to speak,\nthen there's a lot of\nopportunity that opens up.\nI wish there was more of that\nencouraged in children's play,\nbut also, as you mentioned,\nin adult environments.\nBecause yeah, nowadays\nfor all sorts of reasons\nthat you've touched on,\nthe idea of keeping at least\nin arms length distance\nhas become critical.\nThere are a lot of environments\nactually where hugging is not allowed.\nI don't know what it's like in Israel,\nbut in the states many\ninstitutions you're not allowed\nto touch anyone else's body.\nThere's actually a wonderful study\nthat comes to mind from\nan Israeli laboratory,\na guy named Noam Sobel, who's over there,\nwho has shown that by recording\npeople's first interactions\nthat when people meet,\nif they shake hands,\nthey almost always,\nI think it's greater than 85% of the time\nthey will then wipe the chemicals\nfrom the other person onto their own eyes,\ntypically their eyes or their face.\nThis changed a little bit\nduring the whole pandemic thing,\nbut this is thought to be a carryover\nfrom what other animals do\nin terms of exchanging\nmicrobiome elements,\nexchanging chemicals that\nwe're constantly feeding\nour subconscious with\nthe chemical knowledge\nof the chemical constituents\nof other people, right?\nSo, it goes way beyond how people smell,\nhow they look, et cetera.\nMore touch seems to me just, as you said,\nprovided it's consensual,\nit seems like it's just a\nreally good thing overall.\n- And I think maybe also\nimportant for discharging,\ndischarging certain experiences,\nremodeling, reframing.\nSo, it's like touches,\nit's very powerful in that.\nIf you're touched and\nyou're touching a lot,\nyou're unpacking and you\nexperience that touch\nthat maybe has been traumatic\nand you're reframing it,\nyou have the opportunity,\nwhich is something interesting.\nI've heard some story\nabout some traditional culture\nin which when you were burned by mistake,\nthey would immediately burn you again.\nAnd it made me think,\nand then there would not be any burn marks\nand there would not be\nthe same side effects,\nthat's the claim.\nIt made me think it's like,\n\"What's the source of this?\"\nAnd I realized that maybe it allows\na certain completion to happen\nthat in the traumatic moment is not there.\nSo, the re-exposure,\nwhile you're still open,\nthe pores are still open,\nallows you to reframe the experience\nand then the unfolding\nof the rest of the event\nis very different.\nThis is if you're touching\nin your practice in the day-to-day,\nand you're working with people,\nand you're being touched,\nand people come closer, further\naway, it happens naturally.\nYeah, and if you pass a certain limit\nand it becomes too much,\nthere is always, of course, communication\nthat has to be present.\nCertain cultures make\nthis communication pre,\ncertain cultures post.\nThe Israeli, for example, post,\nhere pre.\n- Ah, so in Israel,\nthey'll say, \"That\ndidn't feel good to me,\"\nor, \"That felt good,\" or, \"That was fine.\"\n- Yeah, it would be more common.\nHere in the airport,\nthe guys telling me, \"I'm\ngoing to slide my hands\nup towards your crotch\nuntil I meet the hard stop,\"\nand then he does this in a way\nthat is supposed to show me,\nI have no enjoyment in that\nand for me it just feels aggressive.\nBut his intention is good, showing me.\nBut if it was a loving touch,\nit would be nicer for me actually,\npersonally that's it would be gentle,\nbut he goes up there and he shows me,\n\"I have no enjoyment in this.\"\n[groans] That's my testicle right there,\nso it's different choices.\n[Andrew laughing]\nI don't think it's like worse,\nbut this description can\nbe a bit dissociated.\nAnd what does it make me think?\nIs it truly what he feels or not?\n'Cause it feels robotic, so it's not.\nSo, sometimes I'd rather not say it\nand I'm going to touch your chest\nand just place my hand on the chest.\nAnd, of course I, we\ncan't avoid a problem,\nI'm not suggesting that there is,\nbut there is an examination.\nAnd because I moved around\nand around the world,\nI've seen many things\nand I've seen benefits\nhere and benefits there.\nAnd in the practice, I think\nit's important to discuss this,\nto examine this, I don't have a solution,\nbut it's something to talk about.\n- It is something to talk about,\nand I'm glad you raised it\nbecause I think that it's so clear to me\nthat much of the value\nof a movement practice\ninvolves this dynamic\ninteraction with somebody else.\nAs you pointed out, it can\nbe performed on one's own\nand practiced throughout one's day.\nBut the unpredictability is\na key element to all of it,\nand in bringing out all the potential\nthat you've described.\nIn reference to this notion of trauma\nand burn and re-burn.\nMy colleague at Stanford, David Spiegel,\nhe works on trauma\nand has actually on this podcast,\nhe voiced that he's against\nthings like trigger warnings\nbecause of the way that\nit puts the nervous system\ninto this state of\nreadiness and reactivity\nthat can exacerbate problems.\nWhereas, it's very clear\nfrom the literature on trauma\nand trauma relief that\nthe way to deal with that\nis through a controlled,\nbut clearly a controlled\nre-exposure to the trauma\nin order to diminish the\nemotional response over time.\nI mean, it's very clear\nif we avoid the thing,\nobviously we don't want\nto re-injure ourselves\nor re-traumatize,\nbut if one avoids the\nthing that makes them upset\nover and over, all it\ndoes is serve to create\na heightened state of readiness,\nit primes more trauma.\n- Yeah.\n- So, I think\nit makes good sense.\n- I think impressions are very useful here\nalso when stepping into an\narea in which trauma can occur.\nAnd then, by going through the impression\nthat it already occurred,\nyou create some kind of a\nthermal layer of protection,\nso I've already been hit\nwhen I'm entering that space,\nit's so beneficial.\nOr I've already been touched\nin a way that I didn't like\nif I go to a contact improvisation class,\nand just running this\nscenario in your head\nprotects so well, yeah.\n- I'm glad you mentioned\nrunning scenarios in your head.\nI've been curious all\nday as to whether or not\nyou do visualization\nor mental rehearsal of physical movement.\nThis is it seems to be a\npopular idea in the states,\npeople are always asking me, \"You know,\ncan you just imagine a movement\nand learn it better than where\nyou to actually perform it?\"\nMy hunch based on and my understanding\nof the scientific literature\nis that visualization\ncan be useful to some extent\nfor people that are very\ngood at visualization,\nbut for many people, it doesn't help.\nAnd that there's nothing\nlike real physical practice\nto improve physical practice.\n- Yeah, the word visualization's\nnot good, obviously,\nit has to be experientialization\nin a very complete way, not\njust visually, of course.\nAnd unless you already developed\ncertain experience, tangible experience\nthat has benefited from\nfeedback, from outside feedback.\nIt is not a very useful thing to do,\nand it ends up being fabrications.\nBut if you are very experienced\nand you already gained the\nbenefit of being burnt here\nor overextended here,\nthen you have a certain experience\nand then you can strengthen\ncertain aspects of it,\nbut you got to be careful\nbecause you do not have feedback.\nAnd because of the missing feedback,\nyou might develop delusions.\nIt might be that you\ndevelop stronger patterning,\nbut ultimately this would lead you away\nfrom the aliveness of the movement itself.\nDrilling, for example,\nvery useful to learn\na general infrastructure\nof the movement sleeve\nor the technique, but then to dress it up,\nyou need feedback, you\nneed it to be alive,\nyou need to receive something corrective.\n- I love it.\nFor many people, they approach movement\nin the form of weight\ntraining, or yoga, or running.\nYoga's a bit more dynamic,\nbut it fairly linear types\nof exercise and movement,\nPeloton, rowing, those kinds of things.\nI think most people\nwill probably not depart\nfrom those practices entirely\nbecause they like them.\nI'm speaking about myself,\nI like some of those\nvery much, I enjoy them.\nBut in terms of thinking about\nadding a movement practice\nto one's already existing exercise regime,\nI can imagine threading\nit throughout the day,\nI can imagine having a\ndedicated movement practice.\nOne thing that I have started doing\non the basis of some of your teachings,\nand I just sort of created this idea\nis rather than statically\nstanding there and lifting weights,\nactually walking from, as\nI alternate repetitions,\nit occurred to me that\nI'd never done a curl,\na bicep curl with one foot\nin front of the other,\nand then I'd never\nactually switched that up.\nAnd it's kind of an odd stance\nto be standing in parallel\nand curling one's arm,\nit's kind of a ridiculous\nmovement when one thinks about it.\nSo, I started incorporating some of that,\nyou get some strange looks in the gym,\nbut I just give them strange looks back.\nSo, what are your thoughts\n[Ido laughing]\nabout these very linear forms of exercise?\nAnd, do you encourage people\nto expand the play space, as it were,\nfor these kinds of exercise?\nOr do you think that movement\npractice is just best explored\nthrough three dimensionality,\ngravity, and maybe a stick or a ball?\n- Hmm, it's definitely a problem,\nand it's approachable.\nPeople want a quick, people want a hack,\npeople want the icing, there is no cake.\nThere is no cake, and it's\njust like industries of icing,\nicing, icing on what?\nWhat are you putting it on?\nSo, for me that, that's why\nI'm going towards this side,\nit's like I have my life,\nnow tell me what movement\npractices I should pursue.\nYou are movement,\nin essence, you are not\nthinking of yourself\nin any serious way through my eyes.\nThere is a dynamic entity to you,\nthe body is a huge part\nof it communicating,\nyou have genetic layers,\nthere is a personalities\nthat got developed\nand built around various influences,\nbut then there is also\nsome kind of an essence,\nsomething that reeks\nfrom within the cells.\nAnd if you grew up in my family\nand I grew up in your family\nand it would still be the same,\nand that it's something that\nI always try to think about,\nwhat is that inside of me?\nSo, I think these practices,\nthey're very good,\nbut they're not designed for the goal\nthat we think they were designed to do it,\nit orients towards something else.\nFor example, yoga,\nthere is a good book\ncalled the \"Yoga Body\",\nwhich will destroy a lot\nof people's yoga practice.\nAnd it goes into how\ndid we get to this yoga,\nthe influence of Swedish gymnastics\nand Mongolian contortionists,\nand the Western, the West affecting it,\nand then the ancient practice,\nwhich was barely asana-related,\nposture, position.\nSo, actually you said yoga is less linear,\nyoga is very linear, very\nlinear these days, these lines.\nLook at all the traditional dances,\nthey look like nothing like yoga.\nLook at tai dance, look at\nChinese dances, martial arts,\nit's all rounded, it's all curved,\nit's like the like out nature,\nwhat you see in nature and\nthe movement of the animals.\nSo, where does it come from?\nThese are things to understand\nbecause it designs you now, it shapes you.\nYou're placing yourself\nin these forces of change\nand these streams of change,\nand you have a good intention,\nyou just want this or that,\nbut the joke is on us.\nAnd this is the movement practice\nfor me is first education,\nlet's start to think about this.\nI have nothing that I\ncan just sprinkle now,\nsome magic powder that\nwill help resolve this\nbecause it's a start of\na deep investigation.\nAnd then, some of the things,\nlet's talk pragmatically,\nbecause what you described\nis not about you placing the foot in front\nwhen you're curling, it's\nabout the examination,\nthis is why it is a very good direction.\nAnd then, you will need\nanother one, another one,\ndon't get stuck on that\nfoot in front of it\nand try to do with the eyes closed\nor with a different head posture,\nand you will see things arrive,\nunrelated things because\nthe associative mind,\nthe thinking, this relates,\nthis doesn't get to\nthe heart of it, never.\nSo, just infusing\nthese elements like in a cup\nwill create endless combinations,\npossibilities, and a lot of discovery.\nAnd this for me is humility\nof the practitioner.\nI don't know, I try like today with you.,\nI tried various combinations\nand oh, I discover something,\noh, there is, this is a playful approach,\nand this is a researcher approach.\nI don't try to fit my\ntruth into something,\nI'm there to examine.\nI don't have a motive yet, why?\nBecause I'm fine, I don't\ndepend on that to define myself.\nI'm a human being,\nbut if I don't have that sense of worth,\nI'm already like geared\ntowards I need to do this,\nI need to prove this, I have this agenda.\nAnd this is how we get\nall the lies in the world\nand all the problems and difficulties.\nSo, these practices,\nthey are related to it\nto prove this, that, this way,\nwhy we need muscles for X, Y, Z.\nAnd a lot of the reported outcomes\nare often from my place is like funny.\nI hear about something\nlike I heard you say\nabout gratitude practice\nthat actually experiencing from outside\nas somebody else,\nor you are receiving gratitude\nis actually more powerful.\nIt's true, but I see why it's true,\nI'm not sure everybody sees.\nIf somebody tries to feel gratitude,\njust sit with the eyes clothes\nor watch a movie and\nsense the gratitude there,\nit will be clear to you,\none is very difficult to do\nand the other is very easy.\nHence, if gratitude is\nachieved easier this way,\nthat's why it works like that.\nAlthough all the traditional\npractices are about you\nand by challenging yourself\nto sense that gratitude yourself,\nthey achieve much more powerful thing,\nbut this is not the research people\nand the people in the research,\nwe don't have a lot of those people.\nSo, a lot of the things\nthat can arrive to us,\nweight training, the benefits,\nor the way that the hormonal effect,\nthe effect of cognition, et cetera.\nWhen you open a bit and you go far out,\nyou see certain things, not the truth,\nbut maybe less delusion.\nThere is nothing definite,\nbut there is something\nmaybe more wholesome that appears.\nYeah, I think this is so this is a state,\na state of exploration.\nI don't want to have the same\nthought if I already had it,\nwhy would I want to have the same thought?\nI already had it.\nI don't want to have the same practice,\nI don't want to.\nI curled already in this way,\nI want to experience\nsomething else, I want to.\nThere is a benefit to gain,\nNo, but that was better.\nThe better is better,\nis not more, is not faster.\nIt's like better is better,\nand better isn't, we don't\nknow what better is, right?\nSo, it's like it's open.\nOh, this is better, I don't know.\nIt's just more weight, it's one more kilo,\nbut maybe if I remove one kilo,\nI discover something like,\nfor example, power development\nthat has been shown to\ngain certain benefits\nwhen you lighten the load\nand you accelerated more\nin certain conditions,\nbut who discovered it?\nA practitioner, a math person,\nnot Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky,\nthey reported something,\nbut it was already within the\ngrasp of the practitioners.\nAnd I think, and as a\nresearcher, this is very powerful\nto remind yourself this\nand to work with that.\nAnd as a practitioner,\nas a living human being, for everyone,\nI think something very useful.\nAnd then, those plays that you're doing,\npeople give you the weird looks,\nand it's like yeah, I tell people,\n\"You don't want to be normal.\nIf you don't get the weird looks,\nyou're not moving in the right direction.\"\nYou're moving in a very fixed\nand you already know the\nresult of that direction,\nlet's say at least that.\nSo, continue to play with\nthat, continue to play.\nLook elsewhere, look at\nplaces you didn't look at\nbecause this is still like\nwithin the same layer,\none foot in front, one foot behind,\nwhat happens when you do it with a smile,\nthe same workout, and when\nyou do it with a frown?\nOr what happens, breath\nholding or blood restrictions,\nall this is great play,\nand I think very beneficial\nto do, to go through.\n- Love it, I think that's\na wonderful message.\nAnd what I keep hearing\nfrom you over and over again\nis that people should\nexplore, explore, explore.\nAnd listen, I want to thank\nyou for your time today,\nfirst of all, for the incredible teachings\nhere at this table,\nbut also the introduction\nto a movement practice.\nAlthough, now I'm tempted to say\nthat I've been moving my whole life,\nI just didn't know I was-\n- It's true.\n- that it was such a vast landscape.\nAlso, that your willingness to tread out\nin this journey that is truly unique.\nYou know, that the greatest compliment\nthat one can give in science\nis the one that I'm going to tell you now\nbecause it's entirely appropriate,\nwhich is we say you're an n-of-1, right?\nThat and you truly are,\nI don't think there's anyone\nthat has been as willing to\nembrace existing practices,\nevolve them, create new practices,\nand to share so broadly\nto really be willing to give\nand teach so much knowledge.\nYou know, earlier you made\nthe mention of your goals\nof in part of being wild and wise,\nand I'm here to tell you that\nyou are both wild and wise.\nAnd so, thank you so much.\n- Thank you very much, thank you.\n- Thank you for joining\nme today for my discussion\nabout the science and practice of movement\nand movement culture with Ido
