    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to discuss\nthe science and practice\nof flexibility and stretching.\nFlexibility and stretching\nare topics that I believe\ndo not receive nearly as much\nattention as they deserve.\nFor most people, the topics\nof flexibility and stretching\nbring to mind things like yoga,\ninjury prevention, or\nmaybe even contortionism.\nBut it turns out that\nflexibility and stretching\nare features that are built\ninto our basic body plan.\nYoung children, young animals, and adults,\nand, indeed, older children and animals\nall stretch and all have\nsome degree of flexibility.\nIt turns out that having flexibility,\nand our ability to stretch,\nand the interaction between\nstretching and flexibility\nare fundamental to how we move,\nour ability to learn new movements,\nindeed also to prevent\ninjury or repair injuries,\nand to offsetting and\nreducing inflammation\nthroughout the body.\nIn fact, today I'm going to share with you\na remarkable set of studies\nthat show that stretching\ncan actually adjust\nthings like tumor growth.\nThis is work that was done\nby one of the major directors\nof the National Institutes of Health.\nSo, today's discussion will start\nwith a description of the mechanisms,\nliterally the cells\nand the connections\nfrom your nervous system\nthat mediate flexibility and stretching.\nAnd I promise that I'll make\nthat information accessible to you\nwhether or not you have a\nbiology background or not.\nThen with that information in hand,\nI'm going to present to you\nwhat the scientific literature\nsays about the best times\nand ways to stretch,\neverything right down to the detail\nof how long to hold a stretch,\nwhether or not to hold a stretch at all\nbecause it turns out there are\nmultiple kinds of stretching.\nSo, you can imagine you have stretches\nwhere you hold the stretch\nfor a very long time\nand use as little momentum as possible,\nand then there's also\nwhat's called dynamic\nand ballistic stretching\nwhere you're literally swinging your limbs\ntrying to increase the range of motion.\nI will explain the science and application\nof flexibility and stretching\nin the context of sports performance,\nwhether or not you are engaging\nin cardiovascular exercise,\nor resistance exercise, or both,\nwhether or not you're\na competitive athlete\nor simply a recreational\nexerciser, as I am,\nwhether or not you are\ntrying to increase your range\nof motion and flexibility\nfor longevity purposes,\nor whether or not you're trying to do it\nin order to access different\nparts of your nervous system\n'cause we'll soon learn today\nthat your ability to improve flexibility\nand, indeed, to engage in\nspecific stretching exercises\ncan actually be used\nto powerfully modulate\nyour ability to tolerate pain,\nboth emotional and physical pain.\nSo, this thing that we call\nflexibility and stretching\nis actually a vast landscape.\nWe're going to simplify and\norganize all that for you today\nand by the end of today's episode,\nyou're going to have a number\nof simple, easy-to-apply tools\nthat are grounded in the\nbest scientific research\nthat you can apply for\nyour specific goals.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics\nthat are designed to\nget your brain and body\ninto the optimal state for the\ncognitive and physical things\nthat you need to perform\nat the highest level.\nI have to confess, in fact\nI've said it many times before,\nI am not a fan of the word nootropics\nbecause it means smart drugs.\nAnd frankly, as a neuroscientist,\nI'd be remiss If I didn't acknowledge\nthat there's really no\ncircuit in your brain\nfor being smart,\nyou have neural circuits in\nyour brain that are designed\nto get you to focus very well,\nor to task switch very well,\nor to be creative.\nThesis understands this,\nand as a consequence\nthey've designed nootropics\nthat are tailored to your specific needs\nin the cognitive and physical realm.\nWhat I mean by that is if\nyou go to the Thesis site,\nyou fill out a short quiz,\nand they'll give you the opportunity\nto try a small kit of different nootropics\nwith different ingredients.\nYou have the opportunity to\ntry several different blends\nover the course of the month\nand discover which nootropics works best\nfor your unique brain\nchemistry and genetics.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor about eight and a half months now,\nand I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nhave been a game changer.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nThere you'll find that three-minute quiz\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman,\nand use the code HUBERMAN at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular bloodwork done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nOne issue with a lot of blood\ntests and DNA tests out there\nis that you get information\nback about hormone levels,\nmetabolic factors, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker has a very easy\nto use personalized platform\nthat lets you look at those numbers\nand then you can\nliterally move your cursor\nover those numbers and there\nare little popup windows\nthat will tell you the\nthings that you can do\nin terms of lifestyle,\nso exercise, and nutrition,\nsupplementation, and so on\nto bring those numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you.\nSo, it really takes all the\nguesswork out of what to do\nwith that bloodwork and DNA information.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's

also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nthat have cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nAnd, indeed, you can dial in,\nyou can literally program\nthe temperature of your\nsleeping environment\nfrom the time you go to sleep\nuntil the time you wake up in the morning.\nThis turns out to be immensely powerful\nbecause as I've talked\nabout on the podcast before,\nin order to fall asleep\nand stay deeply asleep\nthroughout the night,\nyour body has to drop by\nabout one to three degrees,\nand waking up in the morning\nactually involves a warming\nup of your body temperature.\nFor many people, they just\ncan't precisely control\ntheir sleep environment well enough\nin order for all that to go well.\nI was one such person.\nSo, for a long time I'd\nfall asleep pretty easily,\nbut then I'd wake up in\nthe middle of the night,\nI tended to run warm,\nbut then sometimes I'd feel\nreally tired in the morning\nas if I couldn't wake up.\nI started sleeping on an\nEight Sleep mattress cover.\nI programmed it so that the temperature\nwould be rather cool in the\nearly part of the evening\nwhen I would get into bed\nand then would drop into the\ndeeper phases of the night\nwhen I was entering deep sleep\nand then rapid eye movement sleep,\nand then would warm towards morning,\nit would help me wake up quickly.\nAnd as a consequence,\nI'm sleeping throughout the night now\nand I'm waking up feeling\ncompletely refreshed.\nIf you'd like to try an\nEight Sleep mattress cover,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com/huberman\nto

built\ninto your nervous system\nand into your body that\nallow you to be flexible.\nSome of us feel tighter than others,\nsometimes in specific\nlimbs or areas of our body,\nsome people feel really loose and limb,\nsome people even have what's\ncalled a hyper-flexibility.\nI, for instance, have a relative\nthat can take her fingers\nand bend them back to the point\nwhere they touch her wrist.\nAnd it always makes me\ncringe a little bit,\nbut she can do that without any pain,\nshe seems to have some\nhyper-flexibility in her joints.\nI do not have that feature.\nSome of you may find that\nyou are more flexible\nthan others naturally,\nand some of you might be thinking\nyou don't need to build\nin additional flexibility.\nWell, I think by the\nend of today's episode,\nyou'll realize that almost\nall of us can benefit\nfrom having some sort of\nunderstanding about flexibility\nand having some stretching protocol\nthat we incorporate into our life,\nif not just for physical\nperformance reasons\nand for postural reasons,\nthen also for cognitive\nand mental reasons,\nand I'll be sure to clarify\nwhat all of that means.\nRight now, I'd like to take a moment\nand just highlight the\nflexibility that you already have.\nFor instance, if you were to move your arm\nbehind your torso a little bit\nand then sort of let go\nor stop exerting any effort in doing that,\nyou would find that the limb would return\nmore or less to a position\nnext to your torso,\nat least I would hope so.\nAnd why is that?\nWell, it turns out that there are aspects\nof your nervous system, aspects\nof your skeletal system,\naspects of your muscles,\nand aspects of the connective tissue\nthat binds all of that together,\nthat try and restore a particular order\nor position to your limbs\nand your limbs relative to one another.\nSo, that reflects a very\nspecific set of processes\nthat it turns out are\nthe same set of processes\nthat you use when you are trying\nto enhance flexibility and stretching.\nSo, I'd like to just take a moment\nand review the basic\nelements of nervous system,\nmuscle, connective tissue,\nand skeletal tissue, bone,\nthat allow for flexibility and stretching.\nAnd here we can point\nto two major mechanisms\nby which your nervous system,\nneurons, meaning nerve cells,\ncommunicate with muscles,\nand those muscles communicate\nback to your nervous system\nto make sure that your\nlimbs don't stretch too far,\nthey don't move too far\nsuch that you get injured.\nAnd in addition to that,\nmechanisms that ensure that\nyou don't overload your muscles\ntoo much with weight, or\nwith tension, or with effort\nand damage them that way.\n'Cause it turns out that the\nsecond security mechanism\nof making sure that you\ndon't overload muscles\ncan be leveraged toward\nincreasing your flexibility\nalmost immediately.\nThat's right, there\nare protocols and tools\nthat I'll share with you\nthat are going to allow you\nto vastly improve your\nflexibility over time.\nBut there are also\nmechanisms that allow you\nto quite significantly increase\nyour degree of flexibility\nin a very short period of time,\nand within just a few seconds.\nSo, let's establish some of the\nbasic biological mechanisms.\nAny time we talk about\nbiology or physiology,\nwe're going to talk about structure,\nmeaning the cells and their connections,\nand functions, what they do.\nThere are just a few names to understand,\nyou do not have to memorize these names.\nThe important thing that\nI'd like you to know\nis that flexibility and\nthe process of stretching\nand getting more flexible\ninvolves three major components,\nneural, meaning of the nervous system,\nmuscular, muscles, and connective tissue.\nConnective tissue is the stuff\nthat surrounds the neural\nstuff and the muscular stuff,\nalthough it's all kind of weaved together\nand braided together in complicated ways.\nSome of you may have heard of fascia.\nWe're going to talk a little\nbit about fascia today,\nalthough it's such an interesting tissue\nthat's really deserving\nof its own episode.\nFascial tissue, we're going to\ntalk about some of the stuff\nthat surrounds muscles that\nreally gives you your shape,\nand holds everything together,\nand allows for flexibility to occur.\nSo, here's a key thing\nthat everyone should know\nwhether or not you're talking\nabout flexibility or not.\nYour nervous system controls your muscles,\nit's what gets your muscles to contract.\nSo, within your spinal cord,\nyou have a category of\nneurons, nerve cells,\nthat are called motor neurons.\nTo be precise, they\nare lower motor neurons\n'cause they're in your spinal cord.\nWe call them lower to distinguish them\nfrom the motor neurons\nthat are in your brain\nup in your skull.\nThose lower motor neurons,\nhereafter I'll just refer\nto them as motor neurons.\nIf I want to talk about the\nother kind of motor neurons,\nI'll say upper motor neurons.\nSo, if I say motor neurons,\nI just mean the ones in your spinal cord.\nThose motor neurons send a little wire\nor set of wires out to your muscles,\nand that creates what's called\na neuromuscular junction,\nwhich just means that the\nneurons meet the muscles\nat a particular place.\nThose neurons release a chemical,\nthat chemical is called acetylcholine.\nSome of you may have heard\nabout acetylcholine before,\nacetylcholine also exists in your brain\nand does other things in your brain,\nmainly it's involved\nin focus and attention.\nBut at the neuromuscular junction,\nthe release of acetylcholine\nfrom these nerve cells,\nthese neurons, onto the muscles\ncauses the muscles to contract.\nAnd when muscles contract,\nthey are able to move limbs\nby way of changing the\nlength of the muscle,\nadjusting the function\nof connective tissue\nlike tendons and ligaments.\nAnd for instance,\nif you're bringing your wrist\ncloser to your shoulder,\nthat biceps muscle is\ncontracting, it's getting shorter.\nI mean, in reality it hasn't\ngotten shorter overall,\nit's just temporarily shorter, of course.\nAll of that is controlled by neurons.\nAnd it's those motor\nneurons from the spinal cord\nthat are really responsible\nfor the major movement\nof your limbs by way\nof causing contraction\nof specific muscles at specific times.\nSo, the key thing to\ntake away is that nerve\ncontrols the contraction of muscles.\nNow, within the muscles themselves,\nthere are nerve connections.\nAnd these are nerve connections that arise\nfrom a different set of\nneurons in the spinal cord\nthat we call sensory neurons.\nThe sensory neurons\nexist in a different\npart of the spinal cord,\nand they send a low wire or\nset of wires into the muscles.\nAnd there's a particular\nkind of sensory neuron\nthat comes out of your spinal\ncord and into your muscles,\nwhich are called spindle neurons.\nThey create or they actually\nwrap around muscle fibers,\nkind of corkscrew around them\nand give kind of a spring-like appearance.\nAnd for you aficionados out there,\nthese are intrafusal\nconnections or neurons.\nIntrafusal means within the muscle,\nbut you really don't need to know that\nunless you're really curious about it,\nor you're going to\nbecome a neuroscientist,\nor you're in medical school or something.\nThese spindle connections\nwithin the muscle\nthat wrap around the muscle fibers\nsense the stretch of those muscle fibers.\nSo, now we have two parts to\nthe system that I've described.\nYou've got motor neurons\nthat can cause muscles\nto contract and shorten,\nand we have these spindles\nwithin the muscles themselves\nthat wrap around the muscle fibers,\nand that information\nis sent from the muscle\nback to the spinal cord.\nIt's a form of sensing what's\ngoing on in the muscle.\nMuch in the same way that\nyou have neurons in your eye\nthat sense light in your\nexternal environment,\nyou have neurons in your\near that sense sound waves\nin your external environment,\nyou have neurons in your spinal cord\nthat are sensory neurons\nthat are sensing the amount\nof stretch in the muscles.\nWhat happens is if a given\nmuscle is stretching really far,\nthose sensory neurons, those\nspindles within the muscle\nwill activate and will send\na electrical potential,\nliterally a bit of electricity\nalong that wire's length\ninto the spinal cord.\nAnd then, within the spinal cord\nthat sensory neuron communicates\nthrough a series of intermediate steps,\nbut to the motor neuron\nand makes sure that that\nmotor neuron contracts.\nNow, why would that be useful?\nWell, what this does is\nit creates a situation\nwhere if a muscle is or\nis stretching too much\nbecause the range of motion of\na limb is increased too much\nthen the muscle will contract\nto bring that limb range of\nmotion into a safe range again.\nNow, what determines whether\nor not a range of motion\nis quote-unquote safe or not\nis dictated by a number of things.\nIt's dictated by things that are happening\nin this kind of loop of neural connections\nin the spinal cord and muscle.\nIt's also determined by\nwhat's going on in your head,\nliterally in your mind cognitively\nabout whether or not the\nmovement of that limb\nits increasing range of\nmotion is good for you,\nwhether or not you're\ndoing it deliberately,\nwhether or not it's bad for you.\nAnd then there are also\nsome basic safety mechanisms\nthat are put in there that\nreally try and restrict\nour limb range of motion.\nOkay, so just to clarify,\nthis whole thing looks like a loop,\nand the essential components of the loop\nare motor neurons contract muscles,\nsensory neurons, of\nwhich there are a bunch\nof different varieties,\nwell, in this case, what\nwe're calling the spindles\nare sensing stretch within the muscles.\nAnd if a given muscle is elongating\nbecause of the increased\nrange of motion of a limb,\nthose sensory neurons\nsend an electrical signal\ninto the spinal cord\nsuch that there is an\nactivation of the motor neuron,\nwhich by now should make perfect sense\nas to why that's useful.\nIt then shortens up the muscle.\nIt actually doesn't\nreally shorten the muscle,\nbut it contracts the muscle\nthat brings the limb back\ninto a safe range of motion.\nOkay, so this process is very fast,\nit was designed to keep\nyour body together and safe.\nIt's designed to make sure\nthat you don't take your arm\nand swing it behind your torso\nand it just goes all the way back\nto the middle of your back.\nI mean, unless you're a contortionist\nor you've trained that kind\nof level of flexibility,\nthat would be terrible\nbecause it could provide a\nlot of damage to the muscles,\nand to the connective\ntissue, and so forth.\nSo, that's one basic mechanism\nthat we want to hold in mind,\nthis idea of a spindle that senses stretch\nand can activate\ncontraction of the muscles\nand shorten the muscles.\nThe next mechanism I want to describe,\nand once again there are only two\nthat you need to hold in\nmind for this episode.\nThis other mechanism has\na lot of the same features\nas the one I just described,\nbut it has less to do with stretch,\nin fact, it doesn't\nhave to do with stretch\nas much as it has to\ndo with sensing loads.\nSo, at the end of each muscles\nyou have tendons typically,\nand there are neurons that\nare closely associated\nwith those tendons\nthat are called Golgi\ntendon organs, right?\nThese are neurons that are sensory neurons\nthat sense how much load\nis on a given muscle.\nRight, so if you're lifting\nup something very, very heavy,\nthese neurons are going to fire,\nmeaning they're going to\nsend electrical activity\ninto the spinal cord.\nAnd then, those neurons have\nthe ability to shut down,\nnot activate, but shut down motor neurons\nand to prevent the\ncontraction of a given muscle.\nSo, for instance, if you were to walk over\nand try and pick up a weight\nthat is much too heavy for you,\nmeaning you could not do it\nwithout injuring yourself\nand you start to try and heave\nthat weight off the ground.\nThere are a number of reasons\nwhy you might not be able to lift it,\nbut let's say you start to get it\na little bit off the ground,\nor you start to get some force generated\nthat would allow it to move.\nBut the force that you're generating\ncould potentially rip your\nmuscles or your tendons\noff of the bone,\nright, that it could disrupt the joints\nand it could tear ligaments.\nWell, you have a safety\nmechanism in place,\nit's these Golgi tendon organs,\nthese GTOs, as they're called,\nthey get activated and\nshut down the motor neurons\nand make it impossible for\nthose muscles to contract.\nOkay, so on the one hand,\nwe have a mechanism that senses stretch\nand can figure out when\nstretch is excessive.\nAnd when this system detects\nthat stretch is excessive,\nit activates the contraction of muscles.\nAnd then, we have a second\nmechanism that senses loads,\nand when tension or\nloads is deemed excessive\nby these circuits,\nand remember these\ncircuits don't have a mind,\nthey don't go, \"Oh, this is excessive,\"\nthey just sense loads.\nAnd when those loads\nexceed a certain threshold,\nwell then those GTOs,\nthose Golgi tendon organs,\nsend signals into the spinal cord\nthat shut down your motor neuron's ability\nto contract muscle so that\nyou no longer can lift\nthat heavy load.\nSo, both of these are\nprotective mechanisms,\nbut both of these can be\nleveraged in a very logical way\nand in a very safe way\nin order to increase your\nlimb range of motion.\nSo, there are a couple of\nthings I want to point out\nbefore going a little bit further\ninto how your nervous system\ncontrols flexibility and stretching,\nand those key points are the following.\nThere are now dozens if\nnot hundreds of studies\nthat show that a dedicated\nstretching practice\ncan improve limb range of motion.\nNow, for many of you listening,\nyou're probably saying, \"Duh,\"\nbut I think it's important\nto point that out,\nthat a dedicated stretching practice\ncan increase limb range of motion.\nAnd as you'll soon learn,\nthere are specific mechanisms\nthat can explain that effect.\nThe second point is one of longevity.\nAnd when I say longevity,\nI don't necessarily mean late-stage aging.\nWe all undergo a decrease\nin limb range of motion,\nunless we do something\nto offset that decrease.\nAnd the current numbers\nvary from study to study,\nbut if you look en masse,\nyou look at all of those studies\nand what you basically find\nis that we start to experience\na decrease in flexibility\nfrom about age 20 until about\nage 49 that's pretty dramatic.\nAnd then, of course, it\nwill continue after age 49,\nbut basically it's a 10%\ndecrease every 10 years.\nSo, we could say it's\na 1% decrease per year,\nalthough it's not necessarily linear.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, it's not necessarily\nthat on your 21st birthday,\nyou are 1% less flexible\nthan you were on your 20th birthday\nand it decreased by 1% per year,\nsome of these changes can be non-linear.\nSo, you can imagine the person\nwho's doing just fine\nin terms of flexibility\nbetween 20 and 30,\nand then they get to 32\nand suddenly they've lost\n5% of their flexibility.\nNow, of course, there will be\na ton of lifestyle factors.\nIf you're a regular practitioner of yoga,\nif you have a dedicated\nstretching practice,\nif you're doing other things\nto improve your muscle contractibility,\nso you're doing resistance training\nit turns out can actually\nindirectly improve flexibility.\nThere are a number of different factors,\nbut the key point is that maintaining\nsome degree of flexibility\nand maybe even enhancing range\nof motion and flexibility\nis of immense benefit\nfor offsetting injury\nprovided it's not pushed too far.\nThere are a number of people\nwho have pushed their limb range of motion\nso far that they experience\nall sorts of injuries,\nboth acute and chronic injuries.\nToday, we'll also talk about\nhow to avoid those scenarios.\nOkay, so we've established\nthat there are mechanisms\nwithin the spinal cord,\nmuscles, and connective tissue,\nthose remember it's the motor neurons,\nthe spindles, the GTOs,\nand, of course, the muscles themselves,\nand connective tissue, tendons,\nbut also other forms of connective tissue\nthat establish whether or not a limb\nis going to stay within a\nparticular range of motion or not,\nand whether or not a limb\nis going to be allowed\nby the nervous system to pursue\nor handle a given load, a given tension.\nThere are also mechanisms that arrive\nto the neuromuscular system\nfrom higher up in the nervous\nsystem, from the brain.\nAnd those mechanisms involve\na couple of different facets\nthat are really interesting,\nand I think that we should all know about.\nIn fact, today, I'm going to\nteach you about a set of neurons\nthat I'm guessing 99.9% of\nyou have never heard of,\nincluding all you\nneuroscientists out there,\nif you're out there, and\nI know you're out there,\nthat seem uniquely enriched in humans\nand probably perform essential roles\nin our ability to regulate our physiology\nand our emotional state.\nSo, within the brain,\nwe have the ability to sense\nthings in the external world,\nsomething we called exteroception,\nand we have the ability to sense things\nin our internal world within\nour body, called interoception.\nInteroception can be the\nvolume of food in your gut,\nwhether or not you're experiencing\nany organ pain or discomfort,\nwhether or not you feel good\nin your gut and in your organs,\nthat's actually a kind of\nfeeling, \"Hmm, I feel great,\nI feel sated, I feel relaxed,\"\nbut those are all different\nforms of interoception.\nThe main brain area that's associated\nwith interpreting what's\ngoing on in our body\nis called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.\nIt's a very interesting brain region,\nit's got two major parts.\nThe front of it is mainly\nconcerned with things like smell,\nand to some extent vision, and\nto some extent other things\nthat are arriving from the external world\nand combining with what's\ngoing on internally\nand making sense of all that,\nor at least routing that\ninformation elsewhere\nin your nervous system to make decision,\nlike if you smell something\ngood to approach it,\nor if you smell something bad to avoid it.\nThe front of the insula is really doing\nall of that kind of stuff\nalong with other brain areas.\nThe posterior insula, the\nback of the insula that is,\nhas a very interesting and\ndistinct set of functions.\nThe posterior insula is mainly concerned\nwith what's going on with\nyour somatic experience.\nHow do you feel internally?\nAnd how is the movement\nthat you happen to be doing\ncombining with your internal state\nto allow you to feel,\nas I like to say the nervous\nsystem mainly batches things\ninto yum, like, \"Oh, this\nis really good for me,\"\nyuck, \"This is really bad\nfor me and I need to stop,\"\nor meh, \"This is kind of neutral.\"\nOkay, so this isn't about food,\nbut we could say for most stimuli,\nmost senses, whether or not they're senses\nof things internally or externally,\nour nervous system is\ntrying to make decisions\nabout what to do with that information,\nand so it mainly batches\ninformation into yum,\nI want to keep doing this\nor approach this thing,\nor continue down some path\nof movement, or eating,\nor staying in a temperature\nenvironment, et cetera,\nor yuck, I need to get out of here,\nI don't want any more of this,\nI don't want to keep doing this,\nthis is painful, or\naversive, or stressful.\nAnd then meh, so if it\ndoesn't really matter,\nI can just kind of stay right here or not.\nYum, yuck, and meh.\nWell, in your posterior insula,\nyou have a very interesting population\nof very large neurons,\nthese are exceptionally large neurons\ncalled von Economo neurons.\nThese are neurons that are, again,\nunbeknownst to most neuroscientists\nand they seem uniquely enriched in humans.\nChimpanzees have them\nand some other large animals have them.\nSo, they're found in whales,\nchimpanzees, elephants, and in humans.\nBut even though we are much\nsmaller than most whales\nand even though we are much\nsmaller than most elephants,\nI mean, remember there are baby elephants.\nAs far as I know, they haven't bred up\nlike mini-elephants yet,\nthey seem to have a teacup version\nof pretty much every dog breed.\nYou can look that up,\nI certainly have mixed\nfeelings about this notion\nof trying to downsize everything\nto the point where you could\nkind of like the pocket-sized bulldog\nI think of someday will arrive.\nI'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing\nof different breeds,\nbut because there aren't teacup elephants\nand teacup gorillas, and teacup\nchimpanzees, and so forth,\nmost all of those other\nspecies are larger than us.\nThey have these von Economo neurons\nand we have these von Economo neurons,\nbut we have in upwards\nof 80,000 of these things\nin our posterior insula.\nThese other species tend to have\nsomewhere in the range of\n1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so.\nWhy is that interesting?\nWell, these von Economo neurons\nhave the unique property of integrating\nour knowledge about our body movements,\nour sense of pain and discomfort,\nand can drive motivational processes\nthat allow us to lean into discomfort\nand, indeed, to overcome any discomfort\nif we decide that the discomfort\nthat we are experiencing\nis good for us or directed\ntoward a specific goal.\nThis knowledge turns out\nto be very important to keep in mind\nbecause as we migrate this conversation\ntoward the things that we can do\nto enhance flexibility and stretching,\nyou'll soon learn that there are moments\nwithin a stretching protocol\nwhere you have the opportunity\nto either override pain\nand discomfort to kind of relax through it\nor push through it.\nRight, there's a decision\nfork in the road there,\nand it'll tell you which\nfork in the road to take,\nor to say, \"Uh-uh, I'm\nnot going to do that.\nI'm going to allow these natural reflexes\nof the spindle to kick in\nand just essentially\nstop me from stretching\nif a given limb isn't designed\nor shouldn't be stretched that far.\"\nSo, I'd like you to keep these\nvon Economo neurons in mind.\nI should mention they're named von Economo\nbecause the guy, Constantin von Economo,\nthat discovered them at the\nend of the 1800s, early 1900s,\ndecided to name them after\nhimself, as many scientists do,\nor certainly the\nneurologists and physicians\nare famous for naming\nthings after themselves.\nThese von Economo neurons\nturn out to be very\nimportant to keep in mind\nas we embark on our exploration\nof what sorts of stretching practices\ncan be best applied to\nincrease flexibility\nbecause whether or not\nyou undertake a mild,\nmoderate, or intense flexibility training,\nyou will no doubt encounter\na scenario at some point\nwhere you will have to ask\nyourself, \"Do I quote-unquote\nrelax into this stretch,\nor do I try and push through\njust a little bit of discomfort?\"\nAnd I'll explain how\nto gauge that decision\nin a very specific and ideally safe way,\nand I'll give you some\ntools that will allow you\nto make that decision in a way\nthat best preserves the integrity\nof those neural circuits\nthat I described earlier\nand can keep you safe.\nThese von Economo neurons\nsit in the exact position\nthat one would want to be able to evaluate\nwhat's going on in the body,\nin particular what's going on\nin terms of limb movements,\nhow that relates to our\nfeelings of discomfort.\nAnd then there's the other aspect\nof these von Economo neurons,\nwhich is that these von Economo neurons\nare connected to a number\nof different brain areas\nthat can shift our internal state\nfrom one of so-called\nsympathetic activation.\nSo, this is a pattern of\nalertness and even stress,\nsometimes even panic,\nbut typically alertness and stress\nto one of so called\nparasympathetic activation\nto one of relaxation.\nOftentimes, you'll hear that stretching\nshould be done by\nrelaxing into the stretch.\nWell, what does it actually\nmean to relax into the stretch?\nWell, these von Economo neurons\nsit at this junction where\nthey're able to evaluate\nwhat's going on inside our body\nand allow us to access neural circuitries\nby which we can shift our\nrelative level of alertness\ndown a bit, or our relative\nlevel of stress down a bit\nand thereby to increase so-called\nparasympathetic activation\nand to literally override some\nof those spindle mechanisms,\neven the GTO mechanisms,\nbut especially the spindle mechanisms\nat the neuromuscular and\nmuscular spinal junction.\nAnd in that way,\ngently, subtly override the reflex\nthat would otherwise cause us\nto contract those muscles back.\nThe reason that's possible\nis because your brain\nhas those other kinds of motor neurons,\nthe upper motor neurons\nthat can both direct,\nmeaning control, and can\noverride lower motor neurons.\nI'll give you a brief example of this\nthat you've already done in your life,\nand that we all have the capacity for.\nWhat I'm referring to is the\nmonosynaptic stretch reflex.\nThis is something that every\nfirst year neuroscience\ngraduate student learns,\nwhich is that if you were to step\non a sharp object with a bare foot,\nyou would not need to make the decision\nto retract your foot, you\nwould automatically do that\nprovided you have a\nhealthy nervous system.\nThere are mechanisms in place\nthat cause the retraction of that limb\nby way of ensuring that\nthe proper muscles contract\nand other muscles do not contract,\nin fact, that they fully relax.\nOkay, so in the case of\nstepping on a sharp object\nlike a piece of glass,\nor a nail, or a tack,\nyou would essentially\nactivate the hip flexor\nto lift up your foot\nas quickly as possible.\nIn doing so, that same neural circuit\nwould activate a contralateral,\nmeaning opposite side of the body circuit,\nto ensure that the leg,\nthe foot that's not\nstepping on the sharp object\nwould do exactly the\nopposite and would extend\nto make sure that you don't fall over.\nAll of that happens reflexively,\nit does not require any\nthought or decision making.\nIn fact, humans without any neocortex,\nliterally that who decerebrate\nor an animal that doesn't have...\nWhen I say decerebrate, I\nmean lack of cerebral cortex.\nThey can perform that\nbecause it's all controlled by circuits\nthat are basically below the\nbrain and in the spinal cord.\nThere's a little bit of\nactivation of circuits\nin the kind of deeper parts of the brain,\nbut basically you don't need to think\nor decide in order to do that.\nHowever, if your life depended\non walking across some\nsharp objects, let's say.\nLet's make it a little less dramatic\nso it's not like the \"Die\nHard\" movie or something\nwhere he has to run\nbarefoot across the glass,\nalthough that's a pretty good example\nof what I'm describing here,\nbut let's say you had to walk\nacross some very hot stones\nto get away from something\nthat you wanted to avoid.\nYou could override that stretch reflex\nby way of a decision made\nwith your upper motor neurons,\nyour insula, and your cognition,\nand almost certainly\nthose von Economo neurons,\nwhich would be screaming, \"Don't do this,\ndon't do this, don't do this,\"\ncould shuttle that\ninformation to brain areas\nthat would allow you\nto override the reflex\nand essentially push through the pain.\nAnd maybe even, in fact,\neven not experience the pain\nto the same degree or even at all.\nSo, these von Economo neurons\nsit at a very important\njunction within the brain.\nThey pay attention to what's\ngoing on in your body,\npain, pleasure, et cetera.\nAnd that includes what's\ngoing on with your limbs\nand your limb range of motion.\nThey also are paying attention\nand can control the amount of activation,\nkind of alertness or calmness\nthat you are able to\ncreate within your body\nin response to a given sensory experience.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nthey seem to be uniquely\nenriched in humans,\nthey seem to be related to\nthe aspects of our evolution\nthat allow us to make decisions\nabout what to do with our body\nin ways that other\nanimals just simply can't.\nBefore we go any further,\nI want to give you a practical tool\nthat you can, of course, use,\nbut that will also give\nyou insight and experience\ninto your muscle spindle\nspinal cord circuit mechanisms.\nSo, what I'd like you to do\nis if you're in a proper place to do this,\nyou're going to stand with legs straight,\nmeaning knees not bent,\nand you're going to try\nand touch your toes,\nor for some of you that's\ngoing to be very easy\nand you might even be\nable to put your hands\nflat on the floor.\nI don't have that kind of flexibility,\nit's pretty easy for me to touch my toes.\nI don't care if you\nround your back or not,\nalthough ideally I would\nsay don't round your back.\nNot because it's bad to do so necessarily,\nbut just to try and keep this\nthe same from trial to trial, as it were.\nSo, try and get a sense of\nwhat your range of motion\nis in terms of bending over at the waist\nwhile maintaining a flat back\nand trying to touch your\ntoes or even touch the floor.\nMaybe, again, you can even\ngo hands flat to the floor\nor maybe even far out in front of you.\nOkay, now what I'd like\nyou to do is stand back up\nand I'd like you to\ncontract your quadriceps\nas hard as you possibly\ncan for about 5-15 seconds.\nLet's say 10 seconds\njust to keep things\nmore or less normalized.\nThis obviously is not a\nsuper controlled experiment.\nSo, to contract your quadriceps\nfor those of you who don't know,\nyou're going to extend\nyour lower limb out.\nSo, this would be like kicking,\nalthough don't do it too quickly,\nyou're going to kick out your foot,\nyou should feel your quadriceps contract\non the top of your thighs.\nAnd you're going to try and\nconsciously contract them\nas hard as you can.\nOkay, typically if you\nwant to point your toe\nback towards your knee or\nshin that's also going to help\nsomewhat to contract\neven harder and harder.\nOkay, so, do that for about 10 seconds.\nA lot of you will do\nthis just while standing,\ncontract, contract, contract.\nOkay, then release it,\nand then now go ahead\nand repeat that stretch\nwhere you're trying to touch\nyour toes or touch the floor.\nSo, this is, again, relying more or less\non hamstring flexibility\namong other things.\nOkay, what most of you will find\nis that you have an immediate increase\nin hamstring flexibility,\nor your range of motion has increased.\nIf you didn't experience that,\nthen I would encourage you\nto try and contract your\nquadriceps harder and longer,\nso maybe 20 or 30 seconds,\nand then try this\nso-called experiment again.\nWhy would contracting your quadriceps\nallow your hamstring flexibility\nto suddenly increase?\nWell, the way that our\nmuscles are organized\nis such that we have muscles\nthat are antagonistic to one another.\nSo, our quadriceps and our hamstrings\nwork in sort of a push-pull\nfashion, if you will.\nThey can antagonize one another,\nso when you move your\nheel towards your glutes,\nyou are using your hamstring,\nthe hamstring obviously\nalso does other things\nrelated to hip movement.\nAnd when you lift your knee\nor when you extend your foot\nand contract your quadriceps,\nyou are essentially\nrelaxing the hamstrings.\nNow, of course, most movements\ninvolve both quadricep and\nhamstring in synchrony.\nAnd that synchrony is\nreally an elegant one,\nbut here we're more or less isolating\nthe quadriceps from the hamstrings,\nat least to the extent\nthat it can leverage\nthese spindle stretch mechanisms.\nSo, what happens is when you\ncontract your quadriceps hard,\nyou are relaxing or\nreleasing some of the stretch\nthat's occurring in those\nintrafusal spindle sensory fibers\ngoing into your spinal cord.\nAnd as a consequence,\nyou're able then to stretch\nyour hamstrings further,\nor we can be more accurate and\nsay that your range of motion\nabout the hamstring and its related joints\nis greater when you aren't\nengaging that spindle reflex,\nwhich would cause the\nhamstrings to contract.\nOkay, so if you are somebody\nwho has tight hamstrings,\nthere could be a variety\nof reasons for that,\nbut part of the reason\nis likely to be neural\nand you can release that\nneural spindle reflex\nby contracting the opposite\nantagonistic muscle,\nwhich in this case is the quadriceps.\nThe same thing is true\nand can be leveraged\nfor stretching other muscles.\nSo, for instance, if you're\ngoing to do a tricep stretch,\nthe typical kind of overhead\nwhere you grab your elbow\nand move it toward the\nmidline of your body\nwith using your opposite hand.\nWell, you can do that,\nand then I would suggest\ntrying to flex your bicep,\ncontract your bicep that\nis, while doing that.\nAnd for most people\nyou'll notice a increase\nin the tricep range of motion\nor ability to kind of lean into,\nor to relax into, or to push that stretch,\nexcuse me, a little bit further.\nNow, for you physios out there\nand for those of you that have\nbackgrounds in kinesiology,\nI want to acknowledge,\nof course, there are other mechanisms\nthat are coming into play.\nThere are actually neural connections\nwithin the joints themselves\nthat are providing\nproprioceptive feedback,\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut this is simply to illustrate\nthat part of our range of motion\nis determined by these spindle mechanisms\nthat I spent some time\nfocusing on earlier.\nAnd indeed, this approach can be leveraged\ntoward creating increased\nlimb range of motion,\nnot just for the hamstrings,\nbut for your quadriceps.\nSo, for instance, if you\nhave tight quadriceps,\nyou can do the opposite.\nYou can contract your\nhamstring very intensely\nfor let's say 10 seconds, or\n20 seconds, or 30 seconds.\nSo, that would take some conscious effort\nof bringing your heel\nup towards your glutes.\nYou could do that in a way\nthat you're really trying to\ncontract those muscles hard,\nyou'd have to use some deliberate\nhamstring activation there,\nmeaning you have to use\nthose upper motor neurons\nand the other aspects of your\nupper brain power, as it were,\nto try and really contract your hamstrings\nas intensely as possible,\nthen you would relax that,\nand then you would do your\nquadricep stretch again.\nAnd if you did a pre-hamstring contraction\nmeasurement of your quadricep flexibility,\nand then you did a\npost-hamstring contraction\nmeasure of your quadricep flexibility,\nalmost certainly you would find\nthat that flexibility had increased.\nNow, of course, the muscle\nreally didn't change much,\nthe tendons didn't change much.\nWhat changed was the\npatterns of neural activation\nthat were restricting you\nfrom in the first case\nstretching your hamstring or having a...\nTo be more accurate we should say\nhaving a certain range of\nmotion about the hamstring\nand its related joints\nand those brake mechanisms were removed.\nAnd, of course, then when\nyou contract your hamstring,\nyou're removing some of the neural brakes,\nthe spindle acting as a brake\nand inhibiting that\nquadricep range of motion.\nOkay, so you can imagine this,\nand in fact you can apply this\nfor any number of different muscles,\nthe larger muscles and the sort of biceps,\ntriceps, and hamstrings, quadriceps\nthat are sort of the simplest\nplace to think about this\nand to apply it.\nBut in theory and, indeed, in practice,\nit really works for all\nthe various muscle groups,\nit's just sometimes harder to access\nthese so-called\nantagonistic muscle groups.\nNow, we should take a\nmoment and just discuss\nwhat actually happens\nas we get more flexible\nin the short-term and long-term.\nI just mentioned what\nhappens in the short-term,\nclearly those don't involve\nlengthening of the muscles.\nIt's not like the muscles\nslide along the bones\nor that the tendons really stretch out\nthat much more than they had\nprior to that kind of exercise.\nBut it is the case that if people stretch\nconsistently over a given\nperiod of several weeks or more\nthat there are changes in the muscles.\nThis gets a little bit tricky\nin terms of nomenclature,\nand I just want to highlight that\nbecause I think that a number of people\nget frustrated and confused,\nin fact, when we talk about\nmuscles getting longer.\nYou know, that the whole concept\nof a muscle getting longer\nisn't really in keeping with reality,\nbut there are elements within the muscles\nthat can change their confirmation.\nSo, to get a little bit detailed here,\nand we won't spend too much time on this,\nbut I just want to acknowledge this\nfor those of you that are interested\nin neuromuscular physiology\nand how it relates to flexibility.\nYou know, you have your muscle fibers\nand then you have your\nso-called myofibrils.\nSo, you can imagine\nkind of a single fiber,\nthat fiber, of course, will get input\nfrom those motor neurons.\nAnd then within those fibers,\nyou have what are called sarcomeres.\nAnd you can kind of think about sarcomeres\nas little segments, kind of\nlike the segments of bamboo.\nIf you ever look at bamboo,\nit's not just one big stalk,\nit's got those little\noutpouching along the way\nthat going to break up\nthe what would be just\none big stalk of bamboo\ninto different segments,\nbut they're all connected.\nThe sarcomeres are somewhat like that.\nAnd within the sarcomeres\nyou have a couple of different components.\nOne thing is called myosin,\nwhich is like a thick layer,\nand then the other is actin.\nAnd those are interdigitated, as we say,\nthey're kind of connected to one another,\nkind of like if you were\nput your fingers together\nfrom your two hands.\nIf you put your fingers\nin between one another,\nthat's interdigitated,\nliterally interdigitated in\nthis case, so pun intended.\nAnd that myosin and actin\nkind of move relative to one another\nand they have a lot to\ndo with your ability\nto contract muscles.\nWhen we stretch muscles,\nwhen we go through a stretching practice,\nthere are a number of things that change,\nsome neural, some related\ndirectly to connective tissue,\nbut also it appears from really nice work\nmainly done from McGill University,\nI'll provide a link to a\ncouple of these studies\nif you want to dig in there more deeply,\nthat change the confirmation,\nthe relative size and spacing\nof some of these things\nlike sarcomeres and the\nway that myosin and actin\nkind of work together.\nBut we don't want to think\nof muscles as lengthening,\nwe can, however, think about\nthe resting state of a muscle\nbeing slightly different\nor, indeed, very different\nthan the resting state of a muscle\nof somebody or of a limb\nthat has not undergone\nregular flexibility training.\nSo, that's as much time\nas I want to spend on that\nbecause we could spend an entire hour\ngetting right down into the details,\nbut I do want to emphasize, however,\nthat muscles have different\nparts, they have fibers,\nthey have sarcomeres, they\nhave myosin, they have actin.\nBut the idea of making our muscles longer,\nthat reflects a number of processes\nthat occur basically within\nan existing muscle length.\nThe length of our muscle bellies\nand where our insertions are relative\nto our connective tissue in our limbs\nis genetically determined, right?\nSome people have, for instance,\na bicep that goes all the way\nfrom the crook of their elbow\nup to their shoulder, right?\nAnd some people can if\nthey were to put their arm\nin a 90 degree angle could\nput two or three fingers\nbetween their bicep and their elbow.\nThey have, we can say, a shorter\nbicep, relatively shorter.\nNow, the reason I mentioned\nthese highly detailed cellular mechanisms\nis because as we start to\nembark on different protocols\nfor using stretching\nto increase flexibility\nand range of motion,\nwe need to ask ourselves what\nis preventing our ability\nto extend range of motion?\nIs it the spindle, right?\nIs it because the muscle\nis stretching too much?\nOftentimes, it can be because of that\nand/or because of a sense of pain\nor simply a sense that the\nmuscle is not in a position\nthat it's been in before\nthat's unrelated to pain\nor to spindle activation.\nAnd oftentimes, it can be related directly\nto these changes in the\nconfirmation of myosin and actin,\nand within the context of the sarcomeres.\nNow, of course, you can't peer into\nor sense your individual sarcomeres,\nhowever, you do have neurons\nthat innovate these areas\nand that send that sensory information\nback into the spinal cord and\nup to your brain to interpret.\nSo, you'll find that as we move along,\nthere are specific\nadjustments that you can make\nat both the macro level,\nmeaning how much movement to insert\ninto your stretching, right?\nIs it going to be a static,\nor a dynamic, or even a ballistic stretch?\nOr, for instance, at the micro level,\nthat even just a slight sub-millimeter\nor millimeter increase in the\nstretching of a given muscle\nand it related tissues\ncan translate into an increased\nrange of motion performance.\nAs a quick but relevant aside,\nI thought I'd share with\nyou something useful\nthat's also grounded in this\nnotion of antagonistic muscles.\nSo, for those of you that\ndo resistance training,\nwhether or not it's with body weight,\nor with physical weights,\nor machines, what have you,\nyou may have found that if you,\nlet's say, were to do three\nsets of a pushing exercise,\nso this could be pushups,\nthis could be bench presses,\nthis could be shoulder presses,\nsomething of that sort.\nAnd then, later in the\nworkout you were to do,\nlet's say, machine\npull-downs, or pull-ups,\nor chin-ups of some sort,\nso a pulling exercise.\nTypically, what you would find\nis if you were to do what's\noften called straight sets,\nso you would do three sets of pushups,\nlet's say, with two\nminutes of rest in between\nthat you might be able to get\na certain number of\nrepetitions on the first set.\nLet's just for sake of example,\nlet's say you can get 10\nrepetitions on the first set,\nand then you get eight\nrepetitions on the second set,\nand then you get six\nrepetitions on the third set\nwith two minutes in between,\nand then you would move on at some point\nto your pulling exercises.\nAnd similarly, let's say\nyou were doing chin-ups\nor pull-downs and you\nwould get 10 repetitions,\nrest two minutes,\neight repetitions, rest two\nminutes, and six repetitions.\nOkay, fine.\nWell, typically what people discover\nis that if they interleave\ntheir pushing and pulling exercises,\nprovided they do that for muscles\nthat are antagonistic to one another.\nSo, in this case, pushing with the chest,\nshoulders, and triceps\nfor the pushing exercises,\nand pulling with the back and biceps,\nand, of course, there are\nother muscles involved as well.\nBut because those muscle groups\nare at least in part\nantagonistic to one another,\nwhat people often find\nis that if they were\nto, say, do their pushing\nset, get 10 repetitions,\nthen move to a pulling set\nafter just say 60 seconds\nand perform that pulling set,\nthen go back to the pushing set,\nthen go back to a pulling set,\npush, pull, push, pull,\nin other words, interleaving their sets.\nEven if they were to maintain\nthe same amount of rest\nbetween sets of pushing\nand sets of pulling,\nwhat they discover often is that the drop\nin the number of repetitions that they get\nis somewhat offset.\nSo, rather than get 10, 8, 6,\nas it were with the straight sets,\nit will be 10, 9, 8.\nSo, what this means is\nnot that you're increasing\nthe total rest time to\nfour minutes between sets\nbecause then, of course,\nit wouldn't be equivalent,\nbut rather that while maintaining\nthe same amount of rest\nbetween sets for this same muscle group,\nby going from push, pull, push, pull\nof antagonistic muscles,\nyou're able to have improved performance.\nAnd the reason for that\nhas everything to do\nwith what we were describing before,\nwhich is that typically if\nyou were to do push set,\nrest, push set, rest, push set, rest.\nWell, in between those sets\nand, in fact, actually\nduring those sets of pushing,\nthe pulling muscles that would\nbe involved in the chin-ups\nor pull-downs, et cetera,\nare actually relaxing,\nor at least are being\nreleased of some tension,\nincluding the activation of the\nspindles among other things.\nSo, that's a long-winded way of saying\nthat interleaving push and\npull of antagonistic sets\ncan leverage some of\nthe same neural circuits\nthat we're talking about leveraging\nfor sake of increasing flexibility.\nNow, I offer this to you\nas a tool that you can try.\nOne of the challenges\nwith using this tool,\nhowever, is that you often\nhave to occupy multiple sites\nwithin the gym.\nYou know, if you're doing this at home\nand you have your own\ngym, that's one thing.\nIf you're doing this in a gym\nwhere you have multiple\npieces of equipment,\nwell, then you become that person\nwho has essentially taken\nover some small corner,\nor multiple corners, or\nmachines within the gym.\nAnd oftentimes, you'll\nfind that you'll walk back\nto a machine or you'll walk back\nto a given resistance exercise\nand someone has now taken it over\nand the whole thing could be thrown off.\nSo, it takes a little bit of orchestrating\nin order to do properly.\nBut in general, what people find\nis that this can allow you to\nenhance performance overall\nof these individual movements,\nagain, while maintaining\nthe same amount of rest.\nAnd even if you choose not to do this,\nI encourage you to pay\nattention to this as a concept\nbecause, again, it's leveraging this idea\nof antagonistic muscles,\nflexors and extensors,\nantagonistic neural relationships\nbetween the spinal cord mechanisms\nthat control one set of muscles\nand activating those muscles,\nallowing the opposite\nantagonistic muscle to relax\nand therefore to perform\nbetter on its next set.\nSo, now I'd like to shift to the question\nof what types of stretching\ncan and should we do\nto increase limb range of motion?\nIf our goal is to do that\nin the most efficient way possible\n'cause I realize that most people\ndon't have endless amounts of time\nto dedicate to a stretching practice.\nAnd even for those of us that do,\nI'm sure that you want\nto get the most outcome\nfor a given effort.\nAnd what are the modes of stretching\nthat are going to allow us\nto increase our flexibility\nand limb range of motion most safely?\nNow, there are a number of\ndifferent types of stretching\nor methods of stretching.\nBroadly defined, we can\ndescribe these as dynamic,\nballistic, static, and\nwhat's called PNF stretching.\nPNF stands for Proprioceptive\nNeuromuscular Facilitation,\nand it involves and leverages\nmany of the mechanisms\nthat I described to you earlier.\nThe first two that I mentioned,\ndynamic and ballistic stretching,\nboth involves some degree of momentum,\nand can be distinguished\nfrom static and PNF-type stretching.\nNow, to distinguish dynamic stretching\nfrom ballistic stretching,\nI'd like to focus on\nthis element of momentum.\nBoth involve moving a limb\nthrough a given range of motion,\nin dynamic stretching, however,\nit tends to be more controlled,\nless use of momentum,\nespecially towards the\nend range of motion.\nWhereas in ballistic stretching,\nthere tends to be a bit\nmore swinging of the limb\nor use of momentum.\nSo, I invite you to visualize what dynamic\nand ballistic stretching\nmight look like in your mind,\nyou can even try it if it's\nsafe for you to try it.\nYou know, you could imagine\nswinging your arm up overhead\nas much as possible and bringing it down.\nI'm doing this because I'm seated,\nit's kind of a ridiculous\nmovement to do while seated\nor perhaps at all.\nBut for instance,\nyou can see dynamic and\nballistic stretching.\nAnytime someone, for instance,\nis holding onto something\nwith one arm or maybe not holding on\nand swinging out their foot,\nso essentially getting\nmovement about the hip joint.\nAnd you'll notice that\nsome people raise it up,\nand pause it, and bring it down,\nthat's one form of dynamic stretching.\nWhereas others will swing it up\nand sort of let it carry\nitself a bit further\ndue to the momentum at\nthe top of the movement,\nand then just let it drop back down\nor maybe even control the descent.\nThere is an enormous range\nof parameter space here\nor variables that one could imagine,\nand there's just simply no way\nthat we could subdivide all those.\nBut again, dynamic and\nballistic stretching\nboth involve movement,\nso we have to generate some force\nin order to create that movement.\nBallistic stretching\ninvolving a bit more momentum\nor sometimes a lot more momentum,\nespecially at the end range of of motion.\nNow, both of those are highly distinct\nfrom static stretching,\nwhich involves holding\nthe end range of motion,\nso minimizing the amount\nof momentum that's used.\nSo, to stay with the simple example\nthat we are all now familiar with\nfrom our earlier discussion,\nslowly bending over at the waist\nand trying to touch your toes\nor putting your hands to the floor\nand then holding that end position\nbefore coming up in a\nslow and controlled way,\nsuch that you reduce the\namount of momentum to near zero\nwould be one example of static stretching.\nStatic stretching can\nbe further subdivided\ninto active or passive.\nRight, there are different names\nfor these kinds of approaches.\nYou can hear about the Anderson approach\nor the Jander approach,\nyou can look these sorts\nof things up online.\nAnd, again, people tend to\nname things after themselves,\nso some of these are proprietary\nrelated to specific programs,\nI'm not focusing on those.\nOthers come to be named\nafter the physiologists\nor the practitioners that\ninitially popularize them.\nAs is always the case,\nthere's always a naming and renaming\nand claiming of territory\nwith these things.\nFor the time being, I'd\nlike to just emphasize\nthat static stretching can be both active,\nwhere there's a dedicated effort\non the part of the stretcher, you,\nto put force behind the\nhold to kind of extend\nor literally to extend\nthe range of motion.\nAnd then, there's also\npassive static stretching\nin which it's more of a relaxation\ninto a further range of motion,\nand that can be a subtle distinction.\nAnd there are other ways in\nwhich we can further distinguish\nactive and passive static stretching.\nBut nonetheless, static stretching\ninvolves both those types of\nelements, active and passive,\nbut is really about eliminating momentum.\nAnd then, there's the PNF,\nthe Proprioceptive\nNeuromuscular Facilitation.\nAnd proprioception has\nseveral different meanings\nin the context of\nneuroscience and physiology.\nTo just keep it really simple for today,\nproprioception involves both\na knowledge and understanding\nof where our limbs are in\nspace and relative to our body.\nTypically, relative to the midline,\nso the brain is often trying to figure out\nwhere are our limbs\nrelative to our midline\ndown the center of our body.\nAnd we know where our limbs are\nbased on so-called\nproprioceptive feedback,\nso that's feedback that\ncomes from sensory neurons.\nRight, now you know what sensory neurons\nthat are essentially monitoring\nor responding to events within the joints,\nthe connective tissue, and the muscles,\nand within the deep\ncomponents of the muscles\nlike the spindle reflex,\nand within the tendons like the GTO,\nthe Golgi tendon organ.\nSo, PNF-type stretching\nleverages these sorts of\nmechanisms, these neural circuits,\nby way of, for instance,\nyou would lie on your back\nand if your goal is to increase\nyour hamstring flexibility\nand the flexibility and range of motion\nof other related muscle systems,\nyou might put a strap around your ankle\nand pull that muscle.\nOr I should say, excuse\nme, that limb towards you,\nyou're not going to pull\nthe muscle towards you,\nyou're going to pull that\nlimb your ankle towards you\nto try and get it sort\nof back over your head.\nAnd then, progressively\nrelaxing into that,\nor maybe even putting\nsome additional force\nto push the end range of\nmotion and then relaxing it.\nAnd then, actually trying\nto stretch that same limb\nor increase the limb range\nof motion without the strap.\nRight, sometimes these are\nassisted by other people.\nSo, people will even use loads,\nsometimes they'll even use machines.\nThere are a number of different apparati\nthat have been designed for this,\nsometimes it'll involve\na training partner.\nThere's a huge range of PNF protocols,\nand those protocols can\nbe done both by oneself\nwith or without straps, with machines,\nwith actual weights, or\nwith training partners.\nIf you're interested in\nthe variation of exercises\nto, say, target your hamstrings\nversus your quadriceps\nversus your shoulders versus\nyour chest muscles, et cetera,\nyour neck muscles, and so on,\nthere is an enormous range of information\non dynamic, ballistic,\nstatic, and PNF stretches\nfor all the various muscle groups.\nAnd I should say there\nare some excellent books\non those topics,\nthere are also some excellent videos\non YouTube and elsewhere.\nNowadays, it's pretty\neasy to find exercises\nthat allow you to target\nspecific muscle groups.\nAgain, I encourage you to be\nsafe in how you approach this,\nand I would encourage\nyou also to pay attention\nto the information that soon follows\nas to what sorts of\nprotocols one would use\nto apply those exercises.\nBut the number of exercises\nand the availability of those exercises\nfor targeting different muscle groups\nwith these four different\nkinds of stretching\nis both immense and\nfortunately, thankfully,\nimmediately accessible to\nall of us often at zero cost.\nSo, specific exercises\nto target specific muscle groups aside,\nwe've now established\nthat there are four major\ncategories of stretching,\nor at least those are\nthe four major categories\nI'm defining today.\nAnd we can further divide those categories\ninto which are the ones that\nare going to be most effective\nfor increasing range of\nmotion in the long-term,\nnot just in one individual session.\nAnd there have been a number\nof studies exploring this.\nI can list out at least four,\nand we'll put those four\nas a kind of a cluster\nunder one heading in\nthe show note captions\nthat arrive at essentially\nthe same answer,\nwhich is that for increasing\nlimb range of motion,\nit does appear that static type,\nincluding PNF, but static-type stretching\nis going to be more effective\nthan dynamic and ballistic stretching.\nSo, at least in my\nmind, this is good news.\nWhy is it good news to me?\nWell, while dynamic and\nballistic stretching\ncan be immensely useful\nfor improving performance\nof specific movements,\nin particular, in the\ncontext of particular sports\nlike tennis, or in sprinting,\nor frankly for any sport,\nthey do carry with them\na certain amount of risk\nbecause of the use of momentum.\nSo, you don't need to be highly trained\nin order to perform them.\nIn fact, there is a place\nand we will describe when one\nwould want to apply dynamic\nor ballistic stretching.\nI'll just give away for now,\nI think that most physios out there\nand certainly the ones that I spoke to,\nDr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly\nStarrett, and a few others\npoint to the fact that doing some safe\ndynamic and ballistic stretching\nprior to, say, a resistance\ntraining session,\nor maybe even prior to a\ncardiovascular training session\ncan be useful both in terms\nof range of motion effects\nand in terms of neural activation effects.\nI don't want to use the words warm-up\nbecause warming up is typically associated\nwith increasing core body\ntemperature, as it should be,\nbut for engaging the neural circuits\nand becoming familiarized\nwith the neural circuits\nthat you're about to\nuse in other movements\nwhile also increasing the\nrange of motion of the joints\ninvolved in those movements\nso that you can perform them more safely\nand more confidently.\nSo, I'm certainly not saying,\nI want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying\nthat dynamic and ballistic\nstretching are not useful,\nthey absolutely are,\nbut in terms of increasing\nlimb range of motion\nin the long-term of truly\nbecoming more flexible\nas opposed to transiently more flexible,\nstatic stretching, which includes PNF,\nappears to be the best route to go.\nSo, if your goal is to increase\nyour limb range of motion\nfor a given muscle group, or\nperhaps for all muscle groups,\nalthough you can imagine\nthat'd be pretty tough.\nI mean, you're not going to spend time,\nI could imagine, working on\nyour tongue muscle control\nor neck muscle control\nand every muscle control,\nbut most of us want to\nreduce so-called tightness\nin air quotes and increase\nlimb range of motion\nfor certain muscle groups.\nAnd it appears that\nthe best way to do that\nis going to be static\nstretching of some kind,\nwhich raises the question of how often\nto do that static stretching\nand how long to hold\nthose static stretches.\nAnd we can also ask the question,\nwe should ask the question,\nwhere to hold those static stretches?\nIs it always a good idea to\nhold those static stretches\nat the end or the point of\nmaximal range of motion?\nWe're going to address that now.\nThere's some terrific science around this.\nA slightly older study,\nbut nonetheless a powerful one\nbecause it provided a foundation\nfor a lot of subsequent work,\nwhich basically served to just confirm\nthe answer they got here is\na study from Bandy et al.\nAnd the title of this study\nis The Effect of Time and\nFrequency of Static Stretching\non the Flexibility of\nthe Hamstring Muscles.\nIt was a study involving 93 subjects,\nso 61 men, 32 women ranging\nan age from 21-39 years,\nso a pretty broad demographic\nwho had limited hamstring\nmuscle flexibility,\nhere I'm paraphrasing,\nand randomly assigned\nto one of five groups.\nSo, the four stretching groups\nstretched five days\nper week for six weeks,\nthe fifth group, which served\nas a control, did not stretch.\nThe results clearly show that quote,\n\"The change in flexibility\nappeared to be dependent\non the duration and\nfrequency of stretching.\"\nThis is great,\nthis tells us that stretching\nfor a given amount of time\nscales with the amount\nof limb range of motion\nimprovement that one will see.\nThere were many interesting\nfindings within this study,\nbut the one that I'd like\nto highlight most is quote,\n\"The results of this study\nsuggest that a 30 second duration\nis an effective amount of time\nto sustain a hamstring muscle stretch\nin order to increase range of motion.\nNo increase in flexibility occurred\nwhen the duration of\nstretching was increased\nfrom 30 seconds to 60 seconds,\nor when the frequency of\nstretching was increased\nfrom one to three times per day.\"\nOkay, so now we're starting\nto lay down some parameters.\nWhat this study reveals and\nwhat subsequent studies tell us,\nand we will get into\nthose subsequent studies,\nis that ideally one\nwould do static stretches\nthat are held for 30 seconds.\nPerhaps more in certain instances,\nand I'll explain when that can be useful,\nbut here holding those stretches\nfor more than 30 seconds\ndid not turn out to be\nadditionally useful.\nSo, if you're going to stretch\nyour quadricep, for instance,\nand you're going to hold that\nstretch in static fashion,\nremember not using momentum,\nand you can use the mental tricks\nof either trying to push through the pain,\nwhich I don't recommend necessarily,\nI think that makes us prone to injury,\nor to relax into the stretch,\nbut nonetheless providing some force\ntypically with a hand in\norder to pull your ankle back,\nif you're doing a quadricep stretch,\nsome people might do this\non the edge of a sofa.\nRemember, there are a lot\nof different exercises\nand ways to do this that\nyou can explore elsewhere.\nWell, holding that static\nstretch for 30 seconds\nappears to be sufficient\nto stimulate an increase in\nlimb range of motion over time.\nAgain, these are protocols\nthat were used repeatedly over time,\nand we'll talk about\nhow often to repeat them\nin order to get maximal effect.\nBut 30-second holds for static stretches\nis the number that I\nthink we want to focus on\nand that most of us are\ngoing to want to utilize.\nSo, now let's explore how\nmany sets of static stretching\none ought to do in order to get\na maximum range of motion improvement\nwhile not placing us into a system\nthat's going to create injury\nnor a situation where we have\nto be constantly stretching\nthroughout the day\nbecause, again, most of us\ndon't have time to do that.\nThis issue of sets is an important one.\nIn the context of cardiovascular exercise,\nwe've talked about the\ndata that support the fact\nthat doing at least 150\nand ideally as much as\n200 minutes per week\nof Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise\nis very useful for cardiovascular health\nand for other aspects of health.\nAnd, of course, there are other aspects\nof cardiovascular exercise\nthat could be layered onto and into that\nthat can be useful like 90 second\nmaximal sprints, et cetera.\nDiscussed this a lot in the\nepisode with Dr. Andy Galpin\nand on our episode about endurance.\nAnd we also talked about sets\nin the context of strength\nand hypertrophy building,\nbuilding muscle size and/or strength\nin the episode about that.\nAnd in particular, in the\nepisode with Dr. Andy Galpin,\nand there, we could also arrive\nat some specific parameters.\nAnd it's going to vary, of\ncourse, between individuals,\ndepending on how hard you train,\nwhether or not you take sets to failure,\nyour repetition range, et cetera,\nbut in the context of strength\nand hypertrophy building,\nwe arrived at a approximately six,\nmaybe as many as 10 sets\nper week per muscle group.\nSome of that work is done as direct work\nto a given muscle group, some\nof that work is indirect.\nSo, doing certain pulling exercise,\nof course, will target the\nlatissimus dorsi muscles,\nbut also the biceps.\nSo, that doesn't necessarily\nmean you have to do 10 sets\nfor the biceps and for the lats,\nsometimes you're getting some\nindirect work, et cetera.\nAll of that was delineated in the episode\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\nAnd we arrived at those numbers of sets\naccording to the same criteria\nthat we will apply here,\nwhat is the minimum number of sets\nboth to maintain and to improve\na given mode of performance?\nStrength and hypertrophy\nor cardiovascular health,\nagain, to either maintain or improve.\nAnd we can do the same thing for improving\nor maintaining range of motion\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\nthe data pointed to the fact\nthat if we don't do some dedicated work\nto improve range of motion over time,\nwe will lose our flexibility\nand limb range of motion over time\njust by virtue of the fact\nthat we're not doing\nanything to offset that.\nSo, whether or not you want to maintain,\nreestablish, or gain limb range of motion,\nstatic stretching of holds of\n30 seconds appear to be best.\nNow, the question is how\nlong should you do that?\nAnd how many sets should you do that?\nAnd how many times a\nweek should you do that?\nAnd to answer those questions,\nI'm going to turn to what I think\nis a really spectacular review.\nThis was a review that was\npublished in the year 2018,\nso it's fairly recent,\nfirst author Thomas, Ewan Thomas,\nlast author Palma.\nWe will put a link to this\nin the show note caption.\nThe title of the paper\nis The Relation Between\nStretching Typology\nand Stretching Duration: The\nEffects on Range of Motion.\nIt's a very straightforward title.\nThis is a review article that explored\na number of different studies,\nhad criteria for whether\nor not those studies\ncould be evaluated in the\ncontext of the questions here,\nhad some quality standards\nand some other standards\nthat they applied.\nAnd basically, windowed down\na large collection of studies\nto a remaining 23 articles\nthat were able to be\nconsidered quote, \"Eligible\nand included in the quantitative\nsynthesis done here.\"\nSo, key points from that quantification\nand synthesis done in this paper.\nFirst of all, and I quote,\n\"All stretching typologies\nshowed range of motion improvements\nover a long-term period.\nHowever, the static protocols\nshowed significant gains\nwith a p-value less than .05,\"\nwhich means a probability\nthat cannot be explained\nby chance alone,\n\"When compared to ballistic\nor PNF protocols.\"\nSo, again, that we're hearing\nis that static stretching\nis the preferred mode for\nincreasing limb range of motion.\nAlthough, here they make\nthe additional point\nthat static stretching\nmight even be superior,\nnot just to ballistic stretching,\nbut also to PNF protocols.\nBecause before, as you may recall,\nthere was a distinction\nbetween ballistic and dynamic,\nand static and PNF.\nAnd so, here it appears\nagain that static stretching\nis sort of rising to the top of the list\nas the optimal approach\nrelative to all other\nstretching approaches,\nat least in the context of\nincreasing limb range of motion.\nThe authors go on to say,\n\"Time spent stretching per week\nseems fundamental to elicit\nrange of movement improvements\nwhen stretches are applied\nfor at least or more\nthan five minutes per week.\"\nOkay, this is critical.\nThis is not five minutes per stretch.\nRemember, 30 seconds per static stretch,\nbut at least five minutes per week.\nWhereas the time spent stretching\nwithin a single session\ndoes not seem to have a significant effect\nfor range of motion gains.\nIf this is getting confusing,\nI'll make sure that you soon understand\nexactly what we can export\nfrom these conclusions.\nThe data indicated that\nperforming stretching\nat least five days a week.\nNow, some of you may already be groaning,\nfor at least five minutes per week.\nOkay, so five days per week, that's a lot,\nbut at least five minutes per week,\nfive minutes per week is not that much.\n\"Using static stretching may be beneficial\nto promote range of motion improvements.\"\nOkay, I've read this study in detail now,\nthey highlight, again, the\nreduction in flexibility\nthat occurs from 20-49\nyears of age and so on,\nhow acute bouts of short-term stretching\nup to three weeks can\nimprove stretch tolerance.\nI think that's a key point\nthat in the short-term,\nthe first three weeks of embarking\non a stretching and flexibility program,\nmuch of the improvements\ncome from the short-term\nneural improvements that\nwe talked about before\nof inhibiting the\nspindle reflex and so on.\nAnd also, a stretch tolerance,\na comfort with doing the movements\nand maybe even a comfort in overriding\nsome of the pain mechanisms.\nI'll talk a little bit more\nabout that in just a bit\nand the particular utility of yoga.\nSomething that I don't often practice,\nbut that after reading this article\nthat I'll mention in a little bit,\nI'm considering perhaps taking up\nsome form of yoga protocol.\nNow, I've already highlighted\nsome of the key take aways from the study,\nnamely that we need to get at\nleast five minutes per week\nof static stretching per muscle group.\nAnd based on the previous\npaper that we talked about,\nwe need to divide that five minutes\ninto sets of 30 seconds each.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nit doesn't seem to be the case\nthat you can do all of that\nin one day, unfortunately.\nIt does seem important that the frequency\nof stretching practice\ndistributed throughout\nthe week is important.\nSo, let's talk protocols.\nWe are now talking about\ndoing static stretching,\nso holding, so limiting momentum\nand holding a stretch\nfor 30 seconds per set.\nWe're talking about trying to achieve\nfive minutes per week\nof those static holds,\nbut that we can't do it all in one session\nbecause the frequency of sessions\ndistributed throughout the week\ncorrelates with the improvements\nin limb range of motion.\nSo, what this means is that\nwe should probably be doing\nanywhere from two to four sets\nof 30 second static holds stretches\nfive days per week or\nsome variant thereof.\nAnd I do say some variant\nthereof because it turns out\nthat even though there\nwas that earlier study\nthat we talked about\nthat holding a stretch\nfor more than 30 seconds,\nin that case 60 seconds,\ndidn't turn out to be\nadditionally beneficial.\nIt appears that if you\ndo hold those stretches\nfor 60 seconds per static\nstretching set, for instance,\nyou can get away with stretching\nfewer days per week overall.\nSo, in order to make\nthis as clear as possible\n'cause I do realize there\nare a lot of parameters\nand you might be asking,\n\"Why didn't you just make me a list\nof the exact things I should do?\"\nWell, it doesn't work that way\nbecause once you understand the mechanisms\nand once you understand\nyour particular goals,\nthis information is designed\nfor you to be able to construct\na stretching program that is tailored\nto your specific goals.\nIf I just gave you the stretching\nprogram that I'm doing,\nor I should say that I'm soon to be doing\n'cause I'm soon to be doing one\nbased on the research for\nthis particular episode.\nWell, that wouldn't be beneficial for you\nbecause, for instance, if you\nhave very flexible hamstrings,\nbut not very flexible quadriceps,\nor you are somebody\nwho is engaged in sport\nor not engaged in sport,\nwhat you need to do is\ngoing to vary somewhat.\nSo, what would effective\nstretching protocol look like?\nWe're all trying to improve\nlimb range of motion\nfor different limbs and\ndifferent muscle groups.\nBut just by way of example,\nand it's because the one we've been using,\nlet's talk about hamstrings\nfor the time being.\nThis could, of course, be\napplied to other muscle groups.\nLet's say you want to\nimprove hamstring flexibility\nand limb range of motion\nabout and around the hamstring\nand involving the hamstring,\nyou would want to do three sets\nof static stretching for the hamstring.\nAgain, easy to find such\nexercises on the internet.\nYou would do that by holding\nthe stretch for 30 seconds,\nresting some period of time,\nand doing it again,\nholding for 30 seconds,\nresting some period of time,\nand then holding it for 30 seconds.\nThat would be one training\nsession for the hamstrings.\nI have to imagine that you'd\nprobably want to stretch\nother muscle groups as\nwell in that same session.\nAlthough, at least as far as I could tell,\nthere was no data pointing to the fact\nthat you couldn't do\nyour hamstring stretching\none part of the day\nand your quadricep stretching\nanother part of the day.\nBut presumably, you're\ngoing to want to combine\nyour flexibility training\ninto one single session.\nSo, three sets of 30 seconds each\nget 90 seconds,\nand you would do that\nideally five times a week\nor maybe even more\nbecause it does seem like frequency\ndistributed throughout the\nweek is an important parameter.\nNow, one thing that we\nhave not highlighted\nor at least described\nis how long to rest\nbetween stretching sets.\nAnd despite my efforts,\nI could not find\nresearch-backed information\nthat pointed to whether\nor not 30 seconds of rest\nfor every 30 seconds stretching,\nor 60 seconds rest for every\n30 second stretching was ideal.\nI think it's reasonable to assume\nthat doubling the amount of time\nfor the interleaving rest\nwould be appropriate or at least doable.\nIf anyone out there has\nknowledge about rest\nbetween stretching sets\nand has some physiology,\nor some biology, or some\nexperiential information\nas to why a given ratio of\nduration of static stretch\nto rest in between static\nstretch sets ought to be used,\nplease put it in the comments on YouTube,\nthat'd be a terrific way for\nus to get that information.\nI'd love to do any follow-up\nto links that you provide and so on.\nBut now, we're starting\nto build into a protocol\nthat is backed by the scientific data.\nThree sets of 30 seconds of holds\ndone five times or maybe\neven six times per week.\nOne thing that did show\nup in my exploration\nof the peer-reviewed research\nis this notion of warming up for all this.\nWe haven't talked about that yet.\nIn general, to avoid injury,\nit's a good idea to raise your\ncore body temperature a bit\nbefore doing these kinds of stretches.\nEven these static stretches,\nwhich we can sort of ease into\nand don't involve ballistic\nmovement by definition.\nAnd the basic take away\nthat I was able to find\nwas that if we are\nalready warm from running,\nor from weight training,\nor from some other activity\nthat doing the static stretching\npractice at the end of\nthat weight training,\nor cardiovascular, or\nother physical session\nwould allow us to go immediately\ninto the stretching session\nbecause we're already warm, so to speak.\nOtherwise, raising one's core\nbody temperature by a bit\nby doing five to seven,\nmaybe even 10 minutes\nof easy cardiovascular exercise\nor calisthenic movements,\nprovided you can do those\nwithout getting injured,\nseems to be an ideal way to\nwarm up the body for stretching.\nWe should be warm or warm-up to stretch,\nalthough those warm-ups\ndon't have to be extremely extensive.\nAnd then, just by way of logic,\ndoing the static stretching\nafter resistance training\nor cardiovascular training\nseems to be most beneficial.\nIn fact, and unfortunately\nwe don't have time\nto go into this in too much detail today,\nI was able to find a number of\npapers that make the argument\nthat static stretching prior\nto cardiovascular training\nand maybe even prior\nto resistance training\ncan limit our performance\nin running and resistance training.\nI realize that's a controversial area,\nyou have those who say, \"No,\nit's immensely beneficial,\"\nyou have those who say, \"No,\nit inhibits performance,\"\nand those that say, \"No, it's a matter\nof how exactly you perform\nthat static stretching,\nand which muscle groups,\nand how you're doing this,\nand how much time in between\nstatic stretching and performance.\"\nBut to leave all that aside,\ndoing static stretching after\nsome other form of exercise\nand if not after some form of exercise,\nafter a brief warm-up to raise\nyour core body temperature\ndefinitely seems like the right way to go.\nNow, for some of you out there,\nand I confess for me as well,\ndoing something five days a week\nseems like a big commitment,\neven if that commitment is\none to only do three sets\nof 30 second static stretches.\nI say this because you've got the warm-up,\nI generally like to\nbring a kind of a focus\nand dedication to a practice.\nAnd, of course, because when\ndoing these kinds of protocols,\nit's likely that you're not\njust stretching your hamstring,\nso it's not just 90 seconds of work\nwith a minute of rest in between,\nbut very likely that we're also\ndoing quadricep stretching,\nand also doing stretching\nfor the shoulders,\nand stretching for the back,\nand the neck, and so on.\nAnd so, that entire session\nis going to take some time,\nand five days a week is a\npretty serious commitment\nfor most, especially for those\nof us that don't exercise\nor do athletics for a\nliving, which I don't.\nSo, there is some evidence\nfrom the literature\nthat one can get away with,\nor I don't even know that\nwe should think about it\nas getting away with,\nbut that one can do longer\nhold static stretches\nof up to say 60 seconds,\nbut do fewer total sessions per week.\nSo, rather than three\n30 second static holds,\ndoing three 60 second static holds\nand doing those every other day.\nAnd there really hasn't been\na systematic exploration of this.\nThe article that I was referring\nto just a few moments ago,\nthis analysis of the 23 articles\nwas combined into this\nenormous set of tables\nand some really quite nice graphs\nthat you're welcome to look at\nsince we're going to\nprovide a link to the study.\nThere are a couple of key take\naways that I want to mention\nthat are separate from this issue\nof how long to stretch and how often.\nFirst of all, they describe\nin their discussion\nthat there were improvements\nin range of motion\nindependent of whether or not\npeople did static stretching,\nactive stretching, passive stretching,\nballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.\nSo, all of those forms of stretching\nwill improve limb range of motion.\nThis is essential to point out\nand I want to emphasize this.\nStatic stretching, however,\ngave the greatest degree of\ngains in limb range of motion.\nAnd on average, they saw a 20.9% increase,\nbut some of the other\nincreases they observed\nwere also quite substantial.\nSo, ballistic stretching can also provide\nsome pretty impressive limb\nrange of motion improvements.\nHowever, they tended to be in the range\nof, here they point out, 11.65% increase,\nor in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.\nSo, it appears that the\ngreatest improvements\nin limb range of motion for\nyour time spent and effort spent\nis going to be this minimum\nof five minutes per week\nto elicit a significant response\nwith five days being the minimum\nweekly recommended frequency\nto achieve significant range\nof motion improvements.\nI confess, this was\npretty surprising to me\nwhen I compare flexibility training\nto, say, resistance training\nfor strength and hypertrophy.\nI've had the experience,\nand I know that other people\nhave had the experience,\nand I think Dr. Andy\nGalpin would probably agree\nthat provided one trains\nhard enough and appropriately\nthat you don't need to\ntrain resistance training\nfive days a week in order to\nget significant improvements\nin strength and hypertrophy.\nSome people might need to,\nbut you can get a lot of positive results\nin those variables with\nless frequent training,\ncertainly with three or four\ndays a week of training.\nAnd for cardiovascular training,\nI'm not aware of anyone having tested\nwhether or not one very long run each week\ncan actually increase\ncardiovascular fitness\nand you're not doing anything else.\nAlthough, I have to\nimagine you'd probably see\nsome improvement compared\nto not doing anything,\nbut most people are doing\nrepeated training sessions\nof cardiovascular strength training.\nNot a lot of people are\ndoing five days a week\nof strength training, at\nleast that I'm aware of.\nSome people are, but most\npeople I think are not.\nAnd some people are\ndoing five or more days\na week of cardiovascular training.\nI'm guessing that most people\nare not doing five days a week\nof dedicated static stretch\nrange of motion directed training,\nbut it does appear that that\nfrequency about the week\ngetting those repeated sessions,\neven if they are short for\nan individual muscle group,\nturns out to be important.\nAnd so, that points to perhaps the reason\nwhy so few people are doing\ndedicated range of motion work,\nbut it also reminds me\nthat all of the studies\nthat were described at\nleast in this review\nand some of the other ones that were not\nreally show impressive changes\nin limb range of motion.\nI mean, 20+%, or even 15% with PNF,\nI mean, these are big changes\nthat are going to benefit us,\nthey're going to offset\nthe age-related losses\nin flexibility, for sure,\nif one is dedicated about these practices.\nAnd in many cases,\nthey're going to increase\nlimb range of motion\nin ways that are going to\nallow us better performance\nin certain physical endeavors,\ncertainly better balance.\nAll right, we haven't really talked\nabout balance and stability,\nbut range of motion can\nimpair balance and stability\nin some extreme circumstances,\nbut by and large, limb range\nof motion, lack of tightness,\nimproved posture, improved\nphysical performance, excuse me.\nAnd things of that sort is something\nthat I think we can all benefit from,\nand that are key features of longevity.\nWe don't often think of them\nbecause we so prioritize\ncardiovascular health\nand the relationship between\nthe heart and brain health,\nand resistance training, and\nmusculoskeletal hypertrophy,\nor strength, et cetera.\nBut as I delved into this literature,\nit really highlighted for me the extent\nto which having really\ngood limb range of motion,\nat least maintaining limb range of motion\nas we age from year to year,\nand maybe even improving\nlimb range of motion\ncan be immensely beneficial\nfor reducing pain\nfor, again, improving posture,\nimproving our ability to\nperform, to walk, et cetera.\nAnd indeed, there's a whole literature\nthat relates our limb range of motion\nto things like pain management\nof things related to headache\nand so on and so forth.\nSo, limb range of motion is not just about\nbecoming a contortionist\nor being able to complete the yoga class,\nit really is about maintaining\nthe integrity and the health\nof the neuromuscular system,\nthe connective tissue,\nand the neuromuscular connective network\nbecause those are indeed\nworking as an ecosystem\nand a network.\nI'd like to just briefly touch\non PNF stretching for a moment.\nAgain, this is a vast landscape\nwith many parameters and\ndifferent practitioners,\na lot of competing opinions out there,\nto put it lightly.\nNonetheless, I do want to\nemphasize that the PNF training\nleverages those spindle mechanisms\nand GTO mechanisms that\nwe talked about earlier,\nbut I realize that in describing\nthe quadricep contraction,\nhamstring stretch little mini-experiment\nthat hopefully you did,\nthat I didn't really highlight\nthe role of the GTOs,\nthe Golgi tendon organs that much.\nAnd I just would like to just\nbriefly do that for a moment.\nThe GTOs have multiple functions.\nIn fact, I think even though GTOs\nare in every medical textbook,\nevery physiology textbook,\nevery first year neuroscientist\nlearns about them\nwhen learning about the\nneuromuscular junctions\nand the mechanisms of\ninteroception, et cetera,\nthey're likely to have\nother functions as well.\nAnd one of the reasons why\nPNF stretching does work,\nwhether or not you're\ndoing that by using a strap\nto pull back a limb,\nor whether or not you're\nactively contracting\nyour quadriceps to then\nrelease and emphasize\nstretch range of motion\nfor your hamstrings\nand related muscle groups is\nthat activation of those GTOs,\nmeaning putting loads and\ntension into that system\ncan inhibit the spindles\nin the opposite\nantagonistic muscle groups.\nOkay, so one of the reasons why flexing,\nor I should say\ncontracting your quadriceps\nreally intensely for some period of time\nallows your hamstrings to\nsubsequently experience\ngreater range of motion.\nAnd again, it's not just the hamstrings,\nbut the related connective tissue\nand neural circuits, et cetera\nis because yes, it's\nquote-unquote relaxing\nthe hamstrings and the spindle,\nbut there's also a direct relationship\nbetween activation of\nthe GTOs in the quadricep\nand release of the spindles\nin the hamstring and related muscles.\nThis has a name, it's\ncalled autogenic inhibition,\nit's a fancy name for\ncontraction of one muscle group\nproviding a relaxation\nof the other muscle group\nthat's antagonistic to it.\nAnd it relates back to this idea\nof interleaving sets in the gym.\nSo, if you think back to that example,\nnow it should make sense\nas to why, for instance,\nif you do, let's say,\na set of bench presses\nor shoulder presses,\nand you let's say you get 10 repetitions\nand you fail on the 11th,\nthat muscle is very, very fatigued.\nIf you were to rest some period of time\nand then go back and do another set,\nwell, during the rest, that\nmuscle group has been relaxing,\nit's obviously not\ncontracting the same way\nit was during the resistance set,\nbut by going and doing a pulling exercise\nthat involves the\nantagonistic muscle group,\nso strongly contracting the\nback muscles through a pull\nlike a pull-down, or a chin-up,\nor a row-type exercise,\nyou're activating or near\nactivating the GTO system\nin those pulling muscles in a way\nthat provides autogenic inhibition\nfor the pushing muscles.\nNow, again, the physios out there\nare probably either screaming\nor banging their heads\nagainst whatever sound system\nthis happens to be arriving\nthrough to them saying, \"Wait,\nbut in many cases, the GTOs\naren't activated enough\nto provide that autogenic inhibition.\"\nThat's true, but even the\nsub-threshold activation\nof those intraspinal circuits,\nso the place where the GTO circuit\nand the spindle circuit interact,\ncan provide an additional replenishment\nof, say, the pushing muscles\nwhile you're activating\nthose pulling muscles.\nAnd this is at least one, not the only,\nbut at least one mechanism\nby which interleaving push\nand pull, push and pull\nfor both strength and\nhypertrophy training,\nbut also for range of motion\nstretching-type training\ncan allow you to achieve better results\nin a shorter period of time.\nAnd I raise this because\nI want to keep in mind\nthe efficiency of any training program.\nWe just a moment ago\nestablished that doing,\nfor example, three sets\nof 30 second static holds\ncan be very useful for the hamstrings\nwith let's just say for sake\nof simplicity and practicality\na minute's rest in between.\nBut during that minute's rest,\nyou can stretch the opposite\nantagonistic muscle group,\nsuch as the quadriceps,\nor if you want to use PNF training,\nyou could do loading of\nthe quadriceps in between.\nSo, there are a number of different ways\nin which you can start to\ninterleave static stretching\nwith PNF stretching,\nyou can start to interleave\neven PNF-type protocols\nwith resistance training,\nalthough that gets a bit more complicated.\nYou can really start to construct\nand build protocols\nthat are ideal for you.\nWhat we will do\nis for an upcoming Neural\nNetwork Newsletter.\nSo, for those of you that aren't familiar,\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nhas a so-called Neural Network Newsletter,\nthese are monthly newsletters\nwhere we put distilled points\nfrom the podcast and oftentimes protocols\nin a downloadable PDF form.\nYou can access it by giving us your email,\nwe don't share your email with anybody.\nIf you want to see examples of these,\nyou can go to hubermanlab.com\nand go to the menu and see Newsletter,\nyou don't have to sign up for anything\nto see examples of what these are like.\nI'll provide a couple\nof different protocols,\none that is pure static stretching,\none that involves PNF-type stretching,\nand I'll also put down a protocol\nthat involves the antagonistic\ninterleaved muscle training\nof the sort that I've been describing\na few times throughout this episode.\nAnd then, you can try and apply those\neither separately or maybe\ncombine them in some way\nthat's useful for your goals.\nThere are a couple of key\nelements that are essential\nfor building a safe and\neffective range of motion\nincreasing program that arrived to us\nboth through the peer-reviewed research\nand, admittedly, from people\nthat have been involved\nin teaching and training range of motion\nfor a very long period of time.\nSome of you may be familiar\nwith the so-called Anderson method,\nit's been around for a long time.\nActually have never met Anderson,\nI don't, I should know this,\nI don't even know if he's still alive,\nI hope he's still alive,\nbut in any event, there are\na lot of different features\nto the Anderson and other protocols.\nBut one of the aspects\nof the Anderson protocol\nthat I think is highly relevant.\nIn fact, I know is relevant\nto the peer-reviewed research\nthat we're going to talk\nabout in a few moments\nis this notion of pushing through pain,\nand how active or how passive\nto be about static stretching.\nNow, this is somewhat subjective.\nRight, if you think about\ngetting into a stretch,\nagain, we'll just use the\nhamstrings for example.\nSo, you're either reaching\nfor your toes while seated,\nor maybe you're using a strap\nand you're raising your foot\noverhead while lying down,\nor maybe you're doing a\ntoe touch-type exercise.\nHow far should you reach?\nWhere is the end range of motion?\nShould you balance?\nShould you not balance?\nWe're going to talk a little\nbit more about that in a moment,\nbut Anderson has an\ninteresting idea and principle,\nwhich has thread through\na lot of his teachings\nthat I think are very much\nin keeping with the study\nthat I'm about to describe next,\nwhere he emphasizes to yes,\nto stretch to the end\nof the range of motion,\nbut not to focus so much on\nwhere that range of motion\nhappens to be that day.\nSo, for instance, not thinking, \"Oh,\nI can always touch my toes, for instance.\nAnd therefore that's the starting place\nfor my flexibility training today.\"\nBut rather to take the entirety\nof your system into account\neach day and understand that, okay,\nprovided your warmed up appropriately,\nthat you're now going to\nstretch your hamstrings,\nfor instance, and you're going\nto reach down for your toes,\nbut that your range of motion\nmight be adjusted that day\nby way of tension and stress,\nor by way of ambient\ntemperature in the room.\nAnd to basically define\nthe end range of motion\nas the place where you\ncan feel the stretch\nin the relevant muscle groups.\nI think this is important\nbecause unlike resistance training\nor cardiovascular training,\nwhere we can measure\ndistance traveled over time\nin the case of cardiovascular training,\nor how much weight is on the bar,\nand count repetitions, et cetera.\nWith range of motion training,\nof course, range of motion is the feature\nthat we're interested in,\nbut there is likely to be a lot\nof variation from day-to-day\nbased on a number of different internal\nand external factors.\nAnd so, the Anderson method\nis really about getting into static\nand other forms of stretching.\nI think today we've mainly been focusing\non static stretching and\nholding the end range of motion,\nbut really paying attention\nto the feel of the stretch\nand the muscles involved.\nAnd there are parallels in resistance\nand cardiovascular training\ntoo I realize, right?\nIn the case of trying\nto build hypertrophy,\nor I should say improve\nhypertrophy, muscle size,\noftentimes the best\nadvice that one can give\nis to don't try to lift weights,\nbut rather to challenge muscles.\nNow, of course, you need\nto provide adequate loads\nin order to get hypertrophy,\nbut when you're training\npurely for strength,\nit's about moving weights.\nWhen you're training\npurely for hypertrophy\nor mainly for hypertrophy,\nit's really about challenging\nmuscles using weights\nor other forms of resistance.\nAnd similarly, and in keeping\nwith this Anderson method,\nwhen trying to build limb range of motion,\ndoing static stretching at a\nplace where it's difficult,\nbut that you can experience\nthe stretch of the muscle\ncognitively, consciously being\nable to focus on the muscles\nand their stretch is at least as useful\nas is evaluating the\ncurrent range of motion\nyou're able to achieve.\nSo, what does this mean?\nThis means feel the muscles\nas you stretch them,\ndon't just go through the motions.\nAnd this means don't get so attached\nto being able to always achieve,\nfor instance, a stretch\nof a given distance\nwithin a given session.\nYou might actually find that\nby just finding the place\nwhere you can't get much further\nand holding the static stretch there,\nthat on the second and third set\nthat you happen to be doing that day,\nthat your range of motion will\nbe increased considerably.\nMaybe not, but very likely yes, you will.\nAnd, of course, evaluating\nrange of motion over time\nis the key parameter\nbecause that's the goal\nof all this type of work.\nNow, along these lines,\nthere is this variable that\nwe've mentioned a few times\nof passive versus active stretching,\nand there's this even\nmore nebulous variable,\nthis even more kind of subjective thing\nof how much effort to put into it?\nShould you push into the stretch?\nWould you even want to balance a tiny bit?\nWould you want to reach\ninto that end point\nand try and extend it within\na given set and session?\nAnd for that reason,\nI was excited to find this paper\nentitled A Comparison of\nTwo Stretching Modalities\non Lower-Limb Range of Motion Measurements\nin Recreational Dancers.\nHappens to be done in\nrecreational dancers,\nit's a six-week intervention program\nthat compared low-intensity stretching,\nwhich they call Microstretching.\nThey used a capital M,\nso I don't know if that\nmeans that it's proprietary,\nalthough I didn't see evidence\nof a conflict of interest,\nbut they call it Microstretching.\nBut to be very clear,\nMicrostretching in the\ncase of this manuscript\nis low-intensity stretching.\nAnd they compared that\nwith moderate intensity static stretching\non an active and passive ranges of motion.\nOkay, so there are a lot of\ndifferent variables are here,\nbut I'll just highlight\na few of the things\nthat are really most relevant to us,\nand I'll give you the\ntake away at the outset\nand then return to it at the end\nso that if I lose any of your attention\nin the next couple of minutes,\nat least you have that key take away.\nBasically, what they found\nwas that a six-week training program\nusing very low-intensity stretching\nhad a greater positive effect\non lower limb range of motion\nthan did moderate-intensity\nstatic stretching.\nI find that incredibly\ninteresting, so very low intensity,\nand we'll define what\nthat means in a moment.\nHere, I'm quoting them,\n\"The most interesting aspect of the study\nwas the greater increase\nin active range of motion\ncompared to passive range of motion\nby the Microstretching group.\"\nSo, this relates to what\nwe were just talking about\na few moments ago as it\nrelates to the Anderson method,\nwhich is that very\nlow-intensity stretching,\nmeaning effort that feels not painful\nand in fact might even feel\neasy or at least not straining\nto exceed a given range of motion\nturns out to not just be as effective,\nbut more effective than\nmoderate-intensity stretching.\nSo, what is low-intensity\nstatic stretching?\nWell, they define this as\nthe stretches were completed\nat an intensity of 30-40%\nwhere 100% equals the\npoint of pain, right?\nSo, 30-40% in these individuals,\nand again, I'm paraphrasing,\ninduced a relaxed state\nwithin the individual\nand the specific muscle.\nAnd here they were holding\nthese static stretches\nI should mention for one\nminute, not 30 seconds.\nNow, the control group\nwas doing the exact same overall protocol,\nso daily stretching for six weeks,\nthe same exercises, holding\neach set for 60 seconds,\nbut were using an\nintensity of stretch of 80%\nwhere, again, 100\nrepresents the point of pain\nor the point where the person\nwould want to stop stretching.\nI find these data incredibly interesting\nfor, I think, what ought\nto be obvious reasons.\nIf you're going to embark on a flexibility\nand stretching training program,\nyou don't need to push\nto the point of pain.\nIn fact, it seems that\neven just approaching\nthe point of pain is\ngoing to be less effective\nthan operating at this 30-40% of intensity\nprior to reaching that pain threshold.\nThe pain threshold being 100%.\nNow, of course, this is pretty subjective,\nbut I think all of us should be able\nto register within ourselves,\nso whether a given range of motion\nor extending a given range of motion\nbrings us to that threshold\nof pain or near pain.\nAnd according to this study at least,\noperating or performing stretching\nat an intensity that's quite\nlow, that's very relaxing\nturns out to be more beneficial\nin increasing range of motion\nthan is doing exercises aimed\nat increasing range of motion\nat a higher intensity.\nOkay, so lower intensity stretching,\nI should say lower\nintensity static stretching\nappears to be the most beneficial way\nto approach stretching.\nAnd I think that's a relief\nprobably to many of us\nbecause it also suggests\nthat the injury risk\nis going to be lower\nthan if one were pushing\ninto the pain zone, so to speak.\nThe authors offer a number\nof different explanations\nas to why this approach, this\nMicrostretching approach,\nmight be more effective.\nHere, I'm paraphrasing\nfrom their discussion\nwhere they mentioned that\nit could be hypothesized\nthat they had improved\nreciprocal inhibition\nwithin the hamstring muscle group.\nSo, this gets right back to\nthe sorts of neural mechanisms\nthat we talked about before,\nthat somehow by doing this\nlow-intensity stretching\nthat they were able to\naccess some of those spindle\nand GTO-type mechanisms that\nwe were referring to earlier,\nand the inhibition of hamstring\nand quadricep stretches.\nThey also offer a number\nof different ideas\nabout how this could shift the activation\nof the so-called sympathetic,\nremember the kind of stress\ndivision of our nervous system,\nand to reduce that relative\nto activation of the parasympathetic arm\nof the nervous system.\nI confess, they have a couple of arguments\naround sympathetic, parasympathetic\nthat are somewhat convoluted.\nI will just in fairness\nto the neuroscience\non those systems,\nI wouldn't suggest putting too much weight\non their arguments about\nsympathetic and parasympathetic.\nTo my mind, they didn't\nreally hold much water,\nbut here I'm not trying to be disparaging\nof the overall work, which I\nthink is really quite sound,\nwhich is that low intensity,\nso called Microstretching,\nis going to be the most effective way\nto increase limb range\nof movement over time.\nI want to just briefly return to this idea\nof whether or not to do\nballistic or static stretching\nbefore some sort of skill training,\nor weight training, or any kind of sport,\nor even cardiovascular\nexercise like running.\nAgain, the data are\nreally split out there.\nThere are even folks who suggest\nthat doing any kind of\nstretching prior to running\nis going to lower running efficiency,\nit's going to require\nessentially more work\nand more oxygen uptake at a given speed\nfor a variety of reasons,\nand runners and that community\nargue about this endlessly.\nThere are papers in both\nsides, in both directions,\nI'm sure I'll hear about\nsome of this in the comments.\nI'm not really going to take a\nstance on this as a consequence\nbecause the data are all over the place.\nHowever, I think there's a\ngeneral logic that we can apply,\nand here I'm borrowing\nfrom some conversations\nand some information put out\nthere by Dr. Andy Galpin,\nwho I think is, of course, both an expert\nand thinks about these things\nin a really sound and\nflexible way, no pun intended.\nThere are instances, for example,\nwhere an individual might want\nto do some static stretching\nto increase limb range of motion\nprior to doing weight training\neven if it's going to\ninhibit that person's ability\nto lift as much weight.\nWhy would you want to do that?\nWell, for instance,\nif somebody has a\ntightness or a limitation\nin their neuromuscular\nconnective tissue system\nsomeplace in their body and system\nthat prevents them from using proper form,\nthat they can overcome by\ndoing some static stretching.\nWell, that would be a great idea\nas Dr. Galpin points out.\nOr for instance, if proper\nstability within the movement\nrequires increasing limb\nrange of motion in some way,\nwell then compromising\nthe use of greater loads\ncould be greatly offset by\ndoing some static stretching\nto improve, say, hamstring flexibility\nor another muscle group flexibility.\nSo, we can't always think about\njust what's going to allow us\nor inhibit us from using\nthe maximal amount of weight\nor from running as far as we want to run\nas fast as we want to run.\nThere are instances where\npeople are trying to overcome\ninjuries where they're trying to come back\nfrom a repetitive surgery\nor something of that sort,\ncoming back from a layoff\nwhere some additional static stretching\nprior to cardiovascular,\nor weight training,\nor skill training, or sport of some kind\nis going to be useful\nbecause it's going to put us\nin a position of greater safety\nand confidence and performance overall,\neven if it's adjusting down our speed\nor the total amount of loads that we use.\nSo, it's you that needs to consider\nwhether or not for you and\nwithin a given training session\nyou want to do static training,\nI should say static stretching\nrange of motion training\nprior to or after that training session.\nAnd similarly, there are a lot of data\npointing to the fact\nthat doing some dynamic\nor even ballistic stretching\nprior to skill training,\nor cardiovascular, or weight\ntraining can be beneficial\nin part to warm-up the\nrelevant neural circuits,\njoints, and connective\ntissue, and muscles,\nand as well to perhaps\nimprove range of motion\nor ability to perform those\nmovements more accurately,\nwith more stability, and\ntherefore with more confidence.\nAnd while Dr. Andy Galpin\nwould never name any\nprotocol after himself,\nhe's far too humble to do that,\nI've named a couple of\nprotocols after him,\nparticularly the Galpin\nequation for hydration,\nbecause he was willing to\nstick his neck out there\nand put down some specific\nnumbers that people could follow\nin order to ensure proper\nhydration during training,\nyou can look up the\nGalpin equation elsewhere.\nYou can just Google it or\nlook elsewhere and find it.\nAnd Dr. Galpin has also been\nvery thoughtful and generous,\nand I think very accurate in offering\na kind of a general organizational logic\nfor how to think about the goals\nof a particular training session,\nand thereby to decide whether or not\nyou're going to do ballistic,\nor static stretching,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo, we can refer to this\ngeneral approach as Galpinian.\nGalpinian, is that right?\nGalpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic.\nThus far, we've been\ntalking about stretching\nfor sake of increasing limb\nflexibility and range of motion,\nbut there are other reasons perhaps\nto embark on a stretching protocol\nthat include both our ability to relax\nand access deep relaxation quickly,\nas well as even to reduce inflammation\nand perhaps even combat\ncertain forms of cancer.\nAnd if that sounds really far-fetched,\nI want to emphasize that the study\nI'm about to share with you in a moment\nwas actually carried out\nby one of the directors\nof a division of the National\nInstitutes of Health.\nAnd this was the work of Helene Langevin,\nwho's a medical doctor, has\ndone really important work\non the mechanisms underlying\nthings like acupuncture\nand has approached all that\nfrom a very mechanistic viewpoint.\nRight, so not looking just at\nthe effects of acupuncture,\nbut really trying to understand\nwhat sorts of cytokines,\ninflammatory molecules,\nand pathways are activated?\nWhat sorts of neural\nmechanisms get engaged\nby things like acupuncture\nthat impinges on the fascial\ntissues and so forth?\nAnd Dr. Langevin is currently\nDirector of the National Institutes\nof Complementary Health and Medicine\nat the National Institutes of Health.\nSo, this is a major division\nsupported by tax dollars\nthat support systematic\nmechanistic exploration\nof things like respiration,\nmeditation, yoga, acupuncture.\nSo, this is serious science\napplied to protocols\nand approaches that have been\nused for some period of time,\nbut really aimed at trying to understand\nwhat would the best protocols\nbe to evolve new protocols?\nSo, there's a really interesting study\ndone in animal models,\nbut I think it's a powerful enough result\nthat I think we all should\npay attention to it.\nThe title of this paper,\nand, again, the last author\nis Dr. Langevin herself,\nis Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth\nin a Mouse Breast Cancer Model.\nAnd yes, you can get mice to stretch,\nit turns out that if you gently\nlift up mice by their tail\nand they'll hold onto their cage,\nthere's a way in which you\ncan mechanically stretch them\nin a way that doesn't harm them.\nFirst, I should mention\nthat Dr. Langevin and others\nhave shown that just a brief\nwhole body stretch of that sort\ninduces an increase in activation\nof the parasympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nagain, not arm, limb arm,\nbut the aspect of the\nautonomic nervous system\nthat creates a whole body,\nwhole nervous system shift\ntoward more relaxation.\nSo, yes, indeed stretching\ninduces relaxation at a systemic level,\nnot just at a local level.\nAnd I think that's important,\nprobably not surprising to those of you\nthat use stretching regularly,\nbut yes, it does indeed relax us.\nYes, you can do this in mice\nand see that in mice as well.\nHere's what they did\nfor this current study,\nor I should say this was\na study published in 2018\nin Scientific Reports.\nThey write, \"Recent studies have shown\nthat gentle daily stretching\nfor 10 minutes can reduce\nlocal connective tissue\ninflammation and fibrosis.\"\nNow, that's local tissue\ninflammation and fibrosis\nas well we now know as\nsystemic inflammation\nand can induce relaxation systemically.\nIn this case, they focused\non mice, not humans.\nAnd mice were randomized to a stretch\nversus no stretch condition\nand were treated for 10 minutes\nonce a day for four weeks.\nSo, it's 10 minutes of this\npassive whole body stretching\na day for four weeks.\nWhat's remarkable, I mean,\njust I have to say is just striking\nis that tumor volume in these mice,\nthey were able to induce\ntumors in these mice\nand the tumor volume at the\nend point was 52% smaller\nin the stretch group compared\nto the no stretch group.\nThis is a highly significant effect,\nand they point out in the\nabsence of any other treatment.\nAnd they explored whether or\nnot cytotoxic immune responses\nwere activated and a\nnumber of other features.\nThey weren't able to get too deeply\ninto the underlying mechanisms,\nbut this is pretty remarkable.\nEven three weeks into stretching protocol,\nthis daily stretching\nprotocol for these mice\ntumor volume was reduced, I\nmean, by it's almost halved,\nthis is pretty incredible.\nSo, they have these\nmeasures of tumor volume\nand the only difference\nin the way these animals\nwere treated and handled\nwas the introduction\nof this daily stretch.\nI find this result to\nbe, of course, limited\nin to the extent that it's\ndone in an animal model,\nnot in humans, we have to point it out,\nbut as they point out in their discussion,\n\"Our results demonstrate a 52% reduction\nin mammary tumor growth over one month\nin mice undergoing stretching\nfor 10 minutes a day\nwithout any other form of therapy.\"\nDo they think that stretching itself\nis changing the tumor size?\nNo, in fact they raise the\npossibility that stretching\nbecause of its impact on the fascia\nmight even create micro environments\nthat are more permissive for tumor growth\nin certain instances,\nso they're careful to emphasize\nwhat I also believe to be the case,\nwhich is that it's unlikely\nthat the stretching itself\nwas directly acting to reduce tumor size,\nbut rather that there's this possible link\nbetween inflammation and\nimmune exhaustion mechanisms\nthat if you can periodically\nrelax a nervous system,\nhere through stretching,\nthat it can affect certain pathways\nrelated to the immune system\nthat would allow the immune\nsystem to combat tumor growth\nto a significant degree.\nSo, again, even though\nthis is a study in mice,\nit argues that relaxation\ninduced by stretching\ncan have a powerful influence\non mammary tumor growth.\nAgain, a huge effect carried out\nby one of the premier labs and individuals\nwho do this sort of work and\nthink about this sort of thing.\nAnd, of course, I want to point out\nit wasn't just Dr. Langevin\nthat did this study,\nthere are a number of\nco-authors on the study\nwe will provide a link to the co-authors,\nexcuse me, we will provide\na link to the study\nso that you can peruse it\nin more detail if you like.\nNow, as a related and\nsomewhat final point,\nI'd like to return to\nthis idea and this place,\nthis real estate within our brain\nthat we call the insular\ncortex, the insula.\nAs you recall, way back at\nthe beginning of this episode,\nwe were talking about\nthe von Economo neurons,\nthat Constantin von Economo\nthe Austrian scientist discovered.\nAnd the fact that we are able to make\nand perform interpretations of\nour internal landscape pain,\nour dedication to a practice,\nfor instance, whether\nor not we are in pain\nbecause it's a practice that\nwe are doing intentionally\nand want to improve ourselves,\nor whether or not it's\npain that's arriving\nthrough some externally\nimposed demands or situations.\nWell, the insula is handling all that.\nAnd fortunately, there's a wonderful paper\nthat was published,\nit was a few years ago now in\nthe journal Cerebral Cortex,\nwhich is a fine journal.\nThis is the year 2014\nentitled Insular Cortex Mediates\nIncreased Pain Tolerance\nin Yoga Practitioners.\nI'll tell you why I like this study.\nI'm personally not a practitioner of yoga,\nI've taken a few yoga\nclasses over the years,\nI've done some of the hot yoga classes.\nThose rooms can get really,\nreally warm, I confess,\nand I've done the kind of\nstandard yoga every now and again.\nIt's not something that\nI've kept up regularly.\nThis study explored the effects\non brain structure volume\nin yoga practitioners.\nAnd for those of you out there\nthat are aficionados in yoga,\nthey pulled subjects from\nhaving backgrounds in the...\nHere, I'm probably going to mispronounce\nthese different things, and forgive me,\nthe Vinysasa yogas, the Ashtanga yogas,\nthe Iyengar yogas, the Sivananda yogas.\nOkay, so some people were\nnew to these practices,\nsome were experienced.\nThat the important take aways\nwere that they took\nthese yoga practitioners\nand they didn't explore\ntheir brain structure\nin the context of yoga itself,\nthey looked at things like pain tolerance.\nSo, they used thermal stimulation,\nbasically they put people into conditions\nwhere they gave them very\nhot or very cold stimuli\nand compared those yoga practitioners\nof varying levels of yoga experience\nto those that had no experience with yoga,\nso-called controls.\nAnd they found some\nreally interesting things,\nthere are a lot of data in this paper,\nbut here's something\nI'd like to highlight.\nThe pain tolerance of yoga practitioners\nwas double or more to that\nof non-yoga practitioners,\neven for those that weren't\ndoing this so-called hot yoga.\nRight, they also found that pain tolerance\nwas significantly greater,\nboth for heat pain and for cold pain.\nThey also found significant\nincreases in insula,\nagain, the insula, this brain region,\ngray matter volume.\nTypically, when we talk about gray matter,\nwe're talking about the\nso-called cell bodies,\nthe location in neurons\nwhere the genome is housed\nand where the kind of all the\nhousekeeping stuff is there.\nAnd then white matter volume\ntends to be the axons,\nthe wires because they're\nensheathed with this stuff\nthat appears white in MRIs,\nand indeed is white under the microscope,\nand indeed is white, it's\nactually lipid, which is myelin.\nSo, increased gray matter\nvolume of the insula\nis a significant finding\nbecause what it suggests is\nthat people that are doing yoga\nhave an increased volume\nof these areas of the brain\nthat are associated with\ninteroceptive awareness\nand for being able to\nmake judgements about pain\nand why one is experiencing pain,\nnot just to lean away from pain,\nbut to utilize or leverage\nor even overcome pain.\nSo, there are many studies of\nyoga and meditation out there,\nfew that have as much\nmechanistic detail as this one.\nAnd in fact, there's a beautiful figure,\nFigure 3 in this paper\nthat shows that the gray matter volume\nof this particular brain region\nscales in a almost linear way\nwith the duration of yoga practice\nthat somebody has been taking on in years.\nSo, people that had, well,\nhey had a few subjects\nthat have up to 15 or 16\nyears of yoga practice\nhad much larger left\ninsula gray matter volume,\nbigger brain areas associated\nwith these abilities.\nAnd I find this interesting\nbecause there are a lot\nof activities out there\nthat don't create these kind\nof changes in brain volume,\nespecially within the insula.\nSo, it appears that it's\nnot just the performance\nof the yogic movements,\nbut the overcoming or the kind of pushing\ninto the end ranges of motion\nand to push through\ndiscomfort to some extent,\nof course, we want people doing\nthat in a healthy, safe way,\nbut that allows yoga practitioners\nto build up the structure and function\nof these brain areas that\nallow them to cope with pain\nbetter than other individuals,\nand to cope with other kinds\nof interoceptive challenges,\nif you will, not just pain but cold,\nnot just pain but discomfort\nof being in a particular\nposition to do that.\nAnd again, we wouldn't want\npeople placing themselves\ninto a compromised position\nliterally that would harm them,\nespecially given that earlier we heard\nthat Microstretching of\nthe kind of non-painful\nsort low-intensity sort is\nactually going to be more effective\nfor increasing end range of motion.\nBut this study really\nemphasizes the extent to which\npractitioners of yoga\ndon't just learn movements,\nthey learn how to control\ntheir nervous system in ways\nthat really reshapes their\nrelationship to pain,\nto flexibility, and to the kinds of things\nthat the neuromuscular\nsystem was designed to do.\nAnd as a final point,\nthere's a beautiful graph in this paper,\nbeautiful I think because it explores\nsome of the more subjective\ndimensions of yoga\nand insula function,\nwhich is a here I'll read\nit out in the nerdy form\nand then I'll explain what it means,\n\"This is a frequency histogram\nof categories of mental\nstrategies used by yogis\nversus controls during the\ncold pain tolerance task.\"\nWhat they're describing here and showing\nis quantitatively how\npeople are conceptualizing\ncold pain in order to get through it.\nAnd the different categories\nare, for instance,\ndistraction, right?\nSome people just choose to\ndistract themselves from pain\nor to attempt to, other\npeople will try to ignore it,\nit's a lot like distraction,\nbut nonetheless, to engage\nin a negative emotion,\nsort of like, \"[growls]\nlike I'm going to dig,\nI'm going to be in resistance to this.\"\nControl subjects tended\nto use those approaches,\nwhereas practitioners\nof yoga tended to use\nother sorts of subjective\napproaches like positive imagery\nto some extent,\nthe ability to relax\ndespite the extreme cold,\nthe ability to quote-unquote accept\nlike, \"This is just happening,\"\ndespite the extreme cold,\nto observe, to third person themselves.\nAnd the greatest effect,\nof course, was to breathe,\nto focus on their respiration\nas a way to deal with this\nchallenge, this cold challenge.\nNow, all of that are subjective data,\nbut I want to remind you that\nthe practitioners of yoga\nare not just using entirely\ndifferent mental strategies,\nbut they are far more\neffective at dealing with pain,\ntheir pain tolerance is much higher\nas evidenced by the other data\nin the previous graphs in the paper.\nSo, while this podcast episode\nis most certainly not about yoga per se,\nit's about flexibility and stretching,\nflexibility and stretching are elements\nwithin yogic practices.\nAnd, of course, yogic practices\ninvolve breathing and mental work,\nand a lot of other things\nbalance, et cetera.\nIt's a vast landscape\nas as many of you know.\nBut I think that if ever\nthere was a manuscript\nthat pointed to the utility\nof something like yoga\nfor sake of tapping into a\nparticular set of brain circuits\nand mechanisms that could wick out\ninto multiple dimensions of life,\nso day-to-day life, stress,\nchallenges in dealing with all\nsorts of external stressors,\ncareer-related,\nfamily-related, relationally,\net cetera, et cetera, excuse me,\nbut as well for increasing range of motion\nfor increasing flexibility.\nSo, if ever there was a practice\nthat one could embark on\nthat would not only increase flexibility\nand limb range of motion,\nbut would also allow one to cultivate\nsome improved mental functioning\nas it relates to pain tolerance\nand other features of stress management\nthat no doubt wick out\ninto other areas of life,\nappears that yoga is a\nquite useful practice.\nAnd so, for those of\nyou that are interested\nin increasing limb range of motion\nand you're already a\npractitioner of yoga, great.\nI can imagine that someday\nthere'll be another study\nlike this one and you'll be in that 10\nor 15-16 year practitioner graph.\nYou'll be that dot way out\non the far end of the graph\nthat shows that your\ninsula is that much bigger\nthan the rest of ours,\nand therefore your internal\nawareness, and pain thresholds,\nand stress management\nwill be that much better,\nbut of course, yoga isn't the only way\nto increase limb range of\nmotion and flexibility.\nUp until now, we've described\na number of different ways to do that\nand we've arrived at some\ngeneral themes and protocols.\nAgain, those themes and\nprotocols will be distilled\ninto some specific and precise list\nin our Neural Network Newsletter,\nbut we can revisit a couple of them now\njust in summary and synthesis.\nStatic stretching appears\nto be at least among\nthe more useful forms of stretching.\nSo, low or zero momentum stretching\ntypically at end range of motion.\nI love this concept of Microstretching,\neven though it's just a couple of studies\nthat have addressed whether\nor not high-intensity\nor low-intensity static stretch\nholds are more beneficial.\nThe idea and indeed the\ndata that low-intensity,\nso 30-40% of what would\none would consider painful\nappears to be more effective\nthan 80% of that threshold.\nI find that incredibly interesting.\nAnd then, there's this idea of frequency,\nit really does appear that getting\nat least five minutes per\nweek total of stretching\nfor a given muscle group\nis important for creating\nmeaningful, lasting changes\nin limb range of motion.\nAnd that is best achieved\nby five day a week,\nor six day a week, or even\nseven day a week protocols,\nbut those can be very short protocols\nlimited to, say, three sets of 30,\nmaybe in 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.\nAlthough, 30 seconds seems\nto be a key threshold there\nthat can get you maximum benefit.\nThere is no need to do\nfull 60-second holds\nunless you're doing fewer\ntotal sessions per week.\nAnd, of course, to always warm-up\nor to arrive at the\nstretching session warm.\nAnd then, of course, there are\nthe other forms of stretching\nthat we touched upon a\nbit, things like PNF.\nAnd we talked about why PNF works,\nthings like the spindle and\nthe Golgi tendon organ reflexes\nthat are built into all of us\nthat we arrive in this world with.\nAnd of course, the other\nforms of stretching\nthat are known to be\neffective and important,\nsuch as dynamic and ballistic stretching.\nAgain, stretching protocols that involve\na lot of momentum in order\nto improve range of motion\nfor performance of\nparticular types of work\nthat one is about to embark on.\nTypically, that would be physical work,\nbut a whole interesting\nand unexplored landscape\nis the extent to which\nchanging limb range of motion\nand different types of body movement\nactually shape our cognitive abilities,\nand that will be the\ntopic of a future episode\nof this podcast.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero-cost\nway to support us.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to our podcast\non Spotify and Apple.\nAnd at both Spotify and Apple,\nyou can leave us up to a five star review.\nIf you have feedback such as comments\nabout the content of\nthis or other episodes,\nor you have suggestions about topics\nthat you'd like us to explore\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nor guests that you would\nlike me to interview,\nplease put those in the\ncomment section on YouTube.\nThat's the best place for us to find them,\nwe do read them all,\nand we do take them into consideration\nwhen building out future programming.\nPlease also check out the sponsors\nmentioned at the beginning\nof today's episode,\nthat's the best way to\nsupport this podcast.\nNot so much on today's episode,\nbut in many episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nwe talk about supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people deriv\ntremendous benefit from them\nfor things like improving\nthe transition time\nand depth of sleep,\nor for improving focus, or\nfor a variety of other things\nincluding things like anxiety management.\nFor that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast\nhas decided to partner\nwith Momentous Supplements.\nFirst of all, Momentous Supplements\nare of the very highest quality,\nthey're used at various\nprofessional sports teams\nand they have contracts\nwith various government organizations\nexploring the role of\nparticular supplements\nin human performance.\nSecond of all, they ship internationally\nbecause we know a number of you\nare outside the country\nof the United States,\nwe hope that will be useful to you.\nAs well, we wanted to\nhave a single location\nwhere people could go to access\nthe most often discussed supplements\nhere on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nSo, while the full catalog\nof those supplements\nisn't quite available yet,\nmany of them are available,\nyou can find them by going to\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman\nto find supplements for sleep,\nfor recovery from exercise,\nfor focus, and many other features\nthat impact mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing Huberman Lab\non Instagram and Twitter, please do so.\nAt both places, I describe\nscience and science-related tools\nthat relate to some of the themes\ncovered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nBut oftentimes I'll do posts\nthat include information\nand tools not detailed here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nWe also have a newsletter,\nI've mentioned this a few\ntimes during today's episode,\nit is the Neural Network Newsletter.\nYou can access that newsletter\ncompletely zero of cost\nby going to hubermanlab.com,\ngo to the menu and sign\nup for our newsletter.\nYou supply your email,\nwe do not share your\nemail with anybody else,\nwe have a very clear privacy\npolicy that you can find there.\nIf you want to see examples\nof previous newsletters,\nyou can find them there\nwithout having to sign up.\nAgain, that Neural Network Newsletter\ncomes out about once a month\nand we use it to distill\nout essential protocols\nfrom the podcast,\nto synthesize information\nfrom the podcast.\nWe do believe many\npeople find them useful,\nso sign up for the\nNeural Network Newsletter\nif you're interested.\nSo, thank you once again\nfor joining me today\nfor a discussion about the neural,\nand neuromuscular, and connective tissue,\nand skeletal aspects of\nflexibility and stretching.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
