    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Rhonda Patrick.\nDr. Patrick is known to\nsome of you as a podcaster\nand one of the premier educators\nin the landscape of\nmitochondria, metabolism, stress,\nand other aspects of\nbrain and body health.\nHer podcast, FoundMyFitness,\nis one of the premier\npodcasts in the world\nfor disseminating knowledge\nabout how the brain and body work\nand how we can use behavioral\ntools, micronutrients,\nsupplements and other protocols\nin order to maximize our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nDr. Patrick did her formal\ntraining in cell biology,\nexploring the links between\nmitochondrial metabolism,\napoptosis, which is naturally\noccurring cell death,\nwhich is a healthy form of cell death\nthat occurs in our brain and\nbody throughout the lifespan,\nand cancer biology.\nShe then went on to do\npostdoctoral training\nwith Dr. Bruce Ames,\ninvestigating the effects\nof micronutrients,\nmeaning vitamins and minerals,\nand how they affect\nmetabolism, inflammation,\nDNA damage, and the aging process.\nShe has published landmark review articles\nand primary research,\nmeaning original research articles,\nin some of the premier\njournals in the world,\nincluding Science, Nature Cell Biology,\nTrends in Cell Biology, and FASEB.\nIndeed, Dr. Patrick is an expert\nin an extraordinarily\nbroad range of topics\nthat impact our health.\nFor today's episode, we focus primarily\non the major categories of micronutrients\nthat are essential for\nbrain and body health.\nI have to confess that\nbefore the discussion\nwith Dr. Patrick,\nI was aware of only one of the categories\nof micronutrients that we discuss,\nand so you'll notice that\nI'm wrapped with attention\nthroughout the discussion.\nAnd I think that you'll want\nto have a pen and paper handy\nbecause she offers not only\na very clear understanding\nof the biological mechanisms\nby which other micronutrients operate,\nbut some very clear and\nactionable tools and items\nthat we can all embark on\nif we are to optimize our\nbrain and body health.\nWe also discuss behavioral protocols.\nDr. Patrick is well known\nfor her understanding\nof the scientific literature on sauna\nand the use of heat and\ncold for optimizing things\nlike metabolism, longevity,\ncardiovascular health,\nand I'm delighted to say\nthat we discus that as well,\nand how behavioral protocols can interface\nwith supplement-based and\nnutritional protocols.\nI'm confident that you'll\nlearn a tremendous amount\nof information from Dr. Patrick,\nmuch of which is immediately actionable.\nAnd if you're not already\nfollowing and listening\nto her excellent podcast, you'll\nabsolutely want to do that.\nIt's foundmyfitness.com is the website\nwhere you can get access to that podcast.\nIt's also on Apple and Spotify\nand YouTube as FoundMyFitness.\nDr. Patrick also has a terrific newsletter\nthat I recommend signing up for.\nIt's foundmyfitness.com/newsletter\nis where you'll find it,\nand it includes research\non fasting, micronutrients,\nsleep, depression, fitness,\nlongevity, and far more,\nalong, of course, with\nactionable protocols.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nOur motivation for\npartnering with Momentous\nis to provide people one\nlocation where they can go\nto access the highest quality supplements\nin the specific dosages\nthat are best supported\nby the scientific research\nand that are discussed\nduring various episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nIf you go to livemomentus.com/huberman,\nyou will see those formulations.\nI should mention that we are going to add\nmore formulations in the months to come.\nAnd you'll see specific suggestions\nabout how best to take those supplements,\nmeaning what dosages and times of day,\nand, in fact, how to\ncombine those supplements\nwith specific behavioral protocols\nthat have been discussed on the podcast\nand are science supported\nin order to drive the maximum benefit\nfrom those supplements.\nAnd many of you will probably\nalso be pleased to learn\nthat Momentous ships not\njust within the United States\nbut also internationally.\nSo, once again, if you go to\nlivemomentus.com/huberman,\nyou'll find what we firmly believe\nto be the best quality supplements\nin the precise dosages\nand the best protocols for\ntaking those supplements\nalong with the ideal behavioral protocols\nto combine with those\nsupplement formulations.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nI'm hosting two live events\nthis May.\nThe first live event will be hosted\nin Seattle, Washington, on May 17th.\nThe second live event will be hosted\nin Portland, Oregon, on May 18th.\nBoth are part of a lecture series\nentitled \"The Brain Body Contract,\"\nduring which I will discuss\nscience and science-based tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nI should point out that,\nwhile some of the material\nI'll cover will overlap\nwith information covered here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nand on various social media posts,\nmost of the information I will\ncover is going to be distinct\nfrom information covered on\nthe podcast or elsewhere.\nSo, once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,\nPortland on May 18th.\nYou can access tickets by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com/tour,\nand I hope to see you there.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one,\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day,\nis that it helps me cover all\nof my basic nutritional needs.\nIt makes up for any\ndeficiencies that I might have.\nIn addition, it has probiotics\nwhich are vital for microbiome health.\nI've done a couple of episodes now\non the so-called gut microbiome\nand the ways in which\nthe microbiome interacts\nwith your immune system, with\nyour brain to regulate mood\nand essentially with\nevery biological system\nrelevant to health throughout\nyour brain and body.\nWith Athletic Greens, I\nget the vitamins I need,\nthe minerals I need,\nand the probiotics to\nsupport my microbiome.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it easy to\nmix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nThere are a ton of data now showing\nthat vitamin D is essential\nfor various aspects of\nour brain and body health.\nEven if we're getting a lot of sunshine,\nmany of us are still\ndeficient in vitamin D3.\nAnd K2 is also important\nbecause it regulates things\nlike cardiovascular function,\ncalcium in the body, and so on.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim the special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes what are called nootropics,\nwhich means smart drugs.\nNow, to be honest, I am not\na fan of the term nootropics.\nI don't believe in smart drugs\nin the sense that I don't believe\nthat there's any one substance\nor collection of substances\nthat can make us smarter.\nI do believe, based on science, however,\nthat there are particular neural circuits\nand brain functions that\nallow us to be more focused,\nmore alert, access creativity,\nbe more motivated, et cetera.\nThat's just the way that the brain works.\nDifferent neural circuits\nfor different brain states.\nAnd so the idea of a nootropic\nthat's just going to make\nus smarter all around\nfails to acknowledge that\nsmarter is many things, right?\nIf you're an artist, you're a\nmusician, you're doing math,\nyou're doing accounting,\na different part of the day,\nyou need to be creative,\nthese are all different brain processes.\nThesis understands this,\nand, as far as I know, they're\nthe first nootropics company\nto create targeted nootropics\nfor specific outcomes.\nThey only use the highest\nquality ingredients,\nwhich, of course, is essential.\nSome of those I've talked\nabout on the podcast,\nthings like DHA, ginkgo\nbiloba, phosphatidylserine.\nThey give you the ability to\ntry several different blends\nover the course of a month,\ndiscover which nootropics work best\nfor your unique brain chemistry\nand genetics and goals,\nand, with that personalization,\ndesign a kit of nootropics that's ideal\nfor the different brain and\nbody states you want to access.\nI've been using Thesis for\nmore than six months now,\nand I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nhave been a total game-changer.\nMy go-to formula is the Clarity formula,\nor sometimes I'll use their\nenergy formula before training.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to takethesis.com/huberman,\ntake a three-minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nfor 10% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed with\na quality blood test.\nWhat's unique about InsideTracker is that,\nwhile there are a lot of\ndifferent tests out there\nfor hormones and metabolic\nfactors, et cetera,\nwith InsideTracker, you\nget the numbers back\nin terms of your levels,\nbut they also give you\nvery clear directives\nin terms of lifestyle,\nnutrition, and supplementation\nthat can help you bring\nthose values into the ranges\nthat are best for you\nand your health goals.\nAnd that's very different than\na lot of the other programs,\nwhere you get a lot of information,\nbut you don't really know what\nto do with that information.\nInsideTracker makes that\nall very easy to understand\nand very actionable\nbased on the very easy-to-use\ndashboard at InsideTracker.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto

longer than you know\nbecause, even before we discussed\nyou coming on this podcast as a guest,\nI've been watching your\ncontent for a very long time.\nSo I want to start off\nby saying thank you.\nYou were the spearhead to break through\nfrom academic science to public education.\nSo I consider you first in,\nand the rest of us are just in your wake.\nSo, thank you for that. It's been-\n- Oh, that is so kind.\nThank you. Thank you so much.\nWell, it's absolutely true.\n- I am so excited to be here\nhaving a conversation with you.\n- Thank you.\nIt's absolutely true.\nIf anyone does their\nresearch, they'll realize\nthat the statement I just\nmade is absolutely true\nand there isn't even a close second.\nAny other public facing educators\nthat have formal science training\nand do regular posting of content\ncame in several years\nafter you initiated it,\nso we're all grateful.\nI have so many questions,\nbut I want to start off\nwith kind of a new but old theme\nthat you're very familiar with.\nSo temperature is a powerful stimulus,\nas we know, for biology,\nand you've covered a lot of material\nrelated to the utility of cold\nbut also the utility of heat,\nand, as I learn more and\nmore from your content\nand from the various papers,\nit seems that there's a bit of a conundrum\nin that cold can stimulate\na number of things,\nlike increases in metabolism, brown fat,\net cetera, et cetera.\nHopefully, you'll tell\nus more about those.\nBut heat seems to be able to\ndo a lot of the same things.\nAnd I wonder whether or\nnot the discomfort of cold,\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nand the discomfort of heat\nmight be anchoring to the same pathway.\nSo, would you mind sharing with us\na little bit about what happens\nwhen we get into a cold\nenvironment on purpose,\nand what happens when we get\ninto a hot environment on purpose?\nAnd I'm hoping that this\nmight eventually lead us\nto some point of convergent\nunderstanding, so if you would.\n- I would love to. Let's take a step back.\nI think you brought up a\nreally important point here.\nAnd I think that point\nhas to do with the intermittent\nchallenging of yourself\nand whether that is through\ntemperature changes,\nlike cold or heat,\nor through other types of\nstressors, like physical activity,\nor perhaps even dietary compounds\nthat are found in plants.\nThese are things like\npolyphenols or flavanols.\nHumans, we evolved to\nintermittently challenge ourselves.\nAnd before we had Instacart,\nwhere you could basically\njust get your food delivered to you,\nbefore the Industrial Revolution occurred,\nwe were out hunting.\nAnd I say, we, not us but humans.\nWe were out gathering.\nWe were moving, and we\nhad to be physically fit.\nYou couldn't catch your prey\nif you were a sedentary slob, right?\nYou were moving, and you\nhad to pick your berries.\nYou had to move.\nAnd so physical activity\nwas a part of everyday life,\nand caloric restriction\nor intermittent fasting\nwas also a part of it.\nThis is another type of challenge.\nWe didn't always have\na prey that we caught,\nor maybe temperatures were\nsuch that there was nothing\nfor us to gather, right?\nSo food scarcity was something common\nas well as eating plants,\nso getting these compounds\nthat I mentioned.\nThese are all types of stress,\nintermittent challenges,\nthat activate genetic\npathways in our bodies.\nThese are often referred to in science\nas stress response pathways\nbecause they respond to\na little bit of stress.\nPhysical activity is strenuous.\nFasting's a little bit\nstressful. Heat, cold.\nThese things are all types\nof little intermittent challenges.\nAnd there is a lot of crosstalk\nbetween these stressors\nand the genetic pathways\nthat they activate.\nAnd these genetic pathways\nthat are activated\nhelp you deal with stress.\nAnd they do it in a way\nthat is not only beneficial\nto help you deal with\nthat little stressor,\nexercise or heat,\nit stays active, and it helps\nyou deal with the stress\nof normal metabolism, normal\nimmune function happening,\njust life, aging, right?\nSo this concept is\nreferred to as hormesis.\nThis is a little bit\nof stressful challenge\nthat activates these\nstress response pathways\nin a beneficial way,\nthat is a net positive,\nthat actually has a very\nprofound antioxidant,\nanti-inflammatory response,\nor whatever the response is.\nIt could be the production\nof more stem cells.\nThese are cells that help regenerate\ndifferent cells within tissues,\nor something like autophagy,\nwhich is a process that can clear away\nall the gunk inside of our cells,\npieces of DNA, protein aggregates.\nSo you'll find that the\nstress response pathways\nare activated by a variety of stressors.\nSo, for example, one pathway\nis called heat shock proteins,\nand, as their name would\nimply, one would go,\n\"Oh, they're activated by heat.\"\nWell, correct. They are\nactivated very robustly by heat.\nAnd we can talk about that.\nYou can eat a plant like broccoli sprouts,\nwhich is high in something\ncalled sulforaphane.\nThis is a compound that is sort\nof like a hormetic compound,\nor, as David Sinclair likes to say,\nit's a xenohormetic compound.\nI love that. I love that term.\nAnd it activates heat shock\nproteins among other things.\nIt also activates a very\npowerful detoxification pathway\ncalled Nrf2, which helps\nyou detoxify things\nlike carcinogens that you're exposed to.\nWell, guess what? Heat activates that.\nSo what I'm getting at\nis there is overlap.\nCold also activates heat shock proteins.\nYou're like, \"Really?\nCold?\" Yes, it activates.\nThese are stress response pathways,\nand they are activated by\nvarious types of stressors.\nNow, you're going to more robustly\nactivate heat shock proteins\nfrom heat versus cold,\nbut there is some overlap.\nSo I think that sort of\nforms the foundation there.\n- Yeah, that's very helpful.\nAnd it brings to mind, in the\ncontext of the nervous system,\nI always tell people you\nonly have a small kit\nof neurochemicals to work with.\nThere isn't dopamine for Netflix,\nand then dopamine for relationship,\nand dopamine for work, et cetera.\nDopamine is a generic pathway\nby which motivation, craving,\nand pursuit emerge, et cetera,\njust like adrenaline is a generic theme\nof many different behaviors.\nIt seems that it is the\njob of biological systems\nto be able to take a\ndiverse range of inputs,\neven unknown inputs.\nLike, we don't know what technology\nwill look like in three years,\nbut you can bet that some\nof those novel technologies\nwill tap into the very systems\nthat I'm talking about now.\nAnd there certainly will be\nother stressors to come about\nthat will tap into these pathways.\nI have two questions related\nto what you just said\nbefore we talk a little bit\nmore about cold and heat.\nYou mentioned plants as a route\nto creating intermittent challenge.\nThere's a lot of debate, mostly online,\nabout whether or not\nplants are our friends\nor plants are trying to kill us.\nThe extreme version from\nthe carnivore types,\npure carnivore diet types,\nis that plants are trying to kill us.\nFrom the plant-based diet folks,\nit seems like it's more\nabout what's healthy\nfor the planet, animals, and maybe for us.\nBut, if we set aside that argument,\nand we just raise the hypothesis\nthat plants have compounds\nthat are bad for us,\nbut maybe by consuming\nthem in small amounts,\nthey're creating this\nhormesis type scenario,\nso then I think we\nconceivably solve the problem.\nWe could say, yes, plants are bad for us,\nbut, in small amounts, they\nprovide this hormetic response\nand they're good for us, right?\nSo, in the same way that\ntoo much heat is bad for us,\ntoo much cold is bad for us,\ncan kill us, can kill neurons,\nbut, appropriately dosed,\nin an intermittent\nchallenge type of scenario,\nit can be good for us.\nIs that how I should think about\nplants and these compounds?\nDo you think of them as good\nfor us or as bad for us?\nThey're a very sharp blade, and\nwe want to use them potently.\n- I actually think that\nit's almost impossible.\nI mean, you'd have to eat nothing\nbut the same plant all\nday, every day in large.\nThe bioavailability of these\ncompounds in the plants,\nthey're attached to a food matrix.\nIt's not like taking it in\na supplement form as well.\nIt's such that it's very\ndifficult to make it toxic.\nNow, there are some cases,\nfor example, if you eat cabbage,\nand I think there's some\ngroup in Africa or somewhere\nthat that's all they eat is cabbage,\nand there is a goitrogen in cabbage.\nIt's not sulforaphane.\nIt's another compound.\nBut that's all they eat,\nevery day. Nothing but that.\n- They get goiter. The thick neck.\n- Yeah, and they're iodine\ndeficient on top of that.\nSo I do think,\nyou can, of course, make.\nI mean, there are types\nof plants that are toxic\nin small quantities, right?\n- Hemlock.\n- [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly.\n- Will kill you.\nFolks, don't play this game with hemlock.\n- But you're not going to get poisoned\nfrom eating your serving of\nbroccoli at dinner, right?\nSo, I mean, it depends on the plant.\nThese generalizations are kind of,\nthey're just not useful,\nand I think that a lot of people\nonline in the blogosphere,\nthey gravitate towards them\nbecause it's just easier,\nand it's a lot more sensational.\n- I eat plants, meat, and starches.\nI'm one of those rare\nomnivores out there now.\n- I do, too.\n- I feel like it's rare to be an omnivore.\nBut I think, once you step\nout of the social media,\nas you said, the blogosphere,\nmost people, I would say,\n99% of people on the planet\nare probably omnivores.\n- Right.\n- And someone will probably correct me,\nbut I doubt the number falls below 98.\n- I think, if you look at data,\nand when we have carnivore\ndata, I can't wait to see it,\nbut, right now, it's a lot of,\nokay, well, this is a lot\nof anecdotal evidence,\nand there's a lot of good\nstarts with anecdotes,\nbut people change a\nthousand things at once,\nand they don't realize that, but they do.\nAnd so anecdotal data\nis only so good, right?\nIt's a starting point.\nAnd so we don't really know long-term\nwhat carnivore diets are going to do.\nThey may be beneficial short-term.\nThey may be beneficial for reasons\nof elimination of other things.\nWho knows, right? Lots of possibilities.\nBut I do think, with respect to plants,\nthat there's so much evidence,\nlike, for example, sulforaphane\nis one that I really like\nbecause there's just\nevidence that sulforaphane\nis a very powerful activator\nof the Nrf2 pathway.\nAnd this is a pathway that\nregulates a lot of genes,\na lot of genes that are related\nto glutathione production,\ngenes that are involved\nin detoxifying compounds\nthat we're exposed to from our food,\nlike heterocyclic amines.\nIn fact, there have been GWAS studies.\nThese are studies that are\ngenome-wide associated studies,\nfor people listening that aren't familiar.\nPeople have a variety\nof versions of genes,\nand we have a gene that's able\nto make heterocyclic amines\nto basically detoxify it\nso it's not as harmful.\nAnd people that don't have\na certain version of that\nthat's doing it well\nare very prone to colon cancer\nand increased cancer risk,\nbut if they eat a lot of broccoli\nand cruciferous vegetables,\nthat negates that risk\nbecause they're getting sulforaphane,\nwhich activates a lot of\nthe glutathione transferase\nand synthase genes.\nSo glutathione's a major\nantioxidant in our brain,\nin our vascular system,\nin our body, basically.\nSo there's evidence that\neating things like compounds\nthat are like sulforaphane or\nbroccoli or broccoli spouts,\nwhich have up to 100\ntimes more sulforaphane\nthan broccoli, are activating\nglutathione in the brain.\nThere's human evidence of that.\nI mean, that's amazing.\n- [Andrew] That is amazing.\n- In Plasma. Yeah.\n- Sorry to interrupt. I\njust want to make sure.\nSo broccoli sprouts are\ndifferent than broccoli,\nand you just told us\nthat they're much richer\nin these compounds.\nSo, note to self, I should\nhave broccoli sprouts,\nnot just broccoli.\nCan we cook the broccoli and\nstill get these nutrients,\nor do we have to eat it raw?\nI confess, eating raw broccoli\nis really aversive to me.\n- So the sulforaphane is formed\nfrom a compound called glucoraphanin,\nwhich is in the broccoli,\nand the enzyme that\nconverted into sulforaphane\nis myrosinase, and it's heat sensitive.\nSo you do somewhat lower\nthe sulforaphane levels\nwhen you cook the broccoli.\nHowever, there was a\nstudy a few years back\nthat showed adding one gram\nof mustard seed powder,\nground mustard seed powder,\nwhich also contains the myrosinase enzyme,\nto your cooked broccoli\nincreases the sulforaphane\nby fourfold, so...\n- This is great 'cause, I confess,\nI like broccoli if it's cooked\nto the appropriate density,\nnot too mushy but definitely not raw.\nThe idea of eating raw broccoli\nto me just sounds horrible,\nbut I like the way mustard seed sounds.\nSo just a little bit\nof mustard seed powder\nadded to the cooked broccoli\ncan recover some of these compounds.\n- Yes, so what I do is I will\nlightly steam my broccoli,\nand then I add a little\nbit of my Kerrygold butter,\nand then I add some mustard\nseed powder on the top of that.\nAnd it's got a little kick.\nIt's just a little spice.\nAnd if you don't taste that, it's expired.\nIt should have a little kick.\n- And because I know\npeople will want to know\nhow often and how much,\nare you eating this every\nday or most days of the week?\n- Well, I had shifted to\nsupplementation with sulforaphane.\nI'm admitting right now that\nI've been terrible about it\nthe past, I don't know, six months or so.\n- The supplementation\nor the broccoli?\n- Yes, the supplementation.\nAnd so there's another way to get.\nThere's another compound,\nand it's actually called moringa.\nAnd Dr. Jed Fahey, who's really\nthe expert on sulforaphane.\nHe's a good friend of mine.\nHe's been on the podcast\na couple of times.\nHe basically thinks,\nand has done a lot of\nresearch on marina as well,\nthat it's like the cousin,\nand it activates the Nrf2 pathways\nsimilarly to sulforaphane.\nAnd so I've been buying this\nKuli Kuli moringa powder.\nI don't have any affiliation with him.\n- Kuli Kuli is a brand?\n- Kuli Kuli's the brand.\n- That you have no affiliation to.\n- I have no affiliation, but\nJed Fahey has researched it,\nlike that specific\nbrand, and so it's legit.\nIt's science backed\nin terms of actually containing\nmoringa and activating Nrf2.\nAnd I add it to my smoothies.\nSo that's what I've been doing.\n- What are some dose ranges?\nAnd, of course, we give\nthe usual recommendations\nthat people should talk\nto their physician,\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut, if people are going\nto, what do you take?\nThat's always the...\n- A big, heaping tablespoon.\n- Let's take\nthe David Sinclairian approach,\nwhere he'll talk about what he does,\nas a way to deal with this.\nOf course, everybody's different\nand should, in all seriousness,\nanytime you add or delete\nsomething from your consumption\nshould consult some trusted\nhealthcare professional,\ntrusted by you.\nDo you recall the dosages?\n- I do a big, heaping tablespoon.\n- So Kuli Kuli moringa.\nIt sounds like a song.\n- It's with a K. I know, it does.\nBut, for people also listening,\nit's like, \"Well, why would I do that?\"\nI mentioned the glutathione in the brain.\nI mentioned it in plasma.\nIt's been shown to lower\nDNA damage in people,\nin white blood cells.\nThere's been several\ndifferent studies in China.\nIn China, there's a lot of air pollution.\nAnd I mentioned that it's a\nvery powerful activator of Nrf2.\nAnd I know you're familiar with Nrf2.\nNrf2 is a transcription factor that is,\nit is binding to a\nlittle specific sequence\nin a variety of different\ngenes, and it's turning them on,\nor, in some cases, turning them off.\nIt's regulating what's being activated\nor what's not being\nactivated, being turned off.\nAnd some of the genes are basically\nthese detoxifying pathways.\nWe talked a little bit\nabout the glutathione,\nbut there's also ones that are involved\nin airborne carcinogens, like benzene.\nSo benzene's found in air pollution.\nI mean, cigarette smoke.\nIf you're smoking cigarettes\nstill, please try to quit.\n- Yeah, you're mutating your DNA.\n- [Rhonda] Yeah, it's the worst.\n- To say nothing of the lung cancer,\nyou're mutating your DNA.\n- And heart disease\nrisk. Heart disease risk.\nBut, anyways.\nPeople, and this has been\nrepeated in more than one study,\nthat literally after 24 hours of taking,\nI can't remember off the top of my head\nwhat the dose of sulforaphane\nfrom broccoli extract,\nbroccoli seed extract was,\nor broccoli sprouts extract, not the seed.\nIt was the sprouts.\nAnyways, they started excreting\n60% benzene and acrolein.\nThat's something that\nwe get in cooked food.\n- It's coming out in their urine?\n- Coming out in their urine. Yeah.\n- Well, I'm not a smoker,\nand I have to be honest.\nIt's rare that I hear of a\nsupplement for the first time\n'cause I've been\ndeep-diving on supplements\nsince I was in my teens.\nThis is fascinating,\nand it brings back to this\nquestion that we had before,\nand I appreciate that you've\nanswered it very clearly.\nPlants have compounds\nthat are good for us.\nThey're not just stressing us.\nThey're activating pathways\nthat are reparative.\nThat's what I'm taking away\nfrom everything you're telling me.\n- Right, and that our bodies,\nwe're supposed to be getting that stress\nto have those pathways activated.\nYou know, right?\nI mean, this is conserved\namong different animals.\nThis is something that is,\nit's supposed to happen.\nAnd, in our modern day world,\nwe don't have to eat plants.\nWe don't have to move\nanywhere or exercise.\nWe don't have to go through\nperiods of not eating food\nbecause we can have it at our fingertips\nat any second, right?\nSo, I mean, we've got this conundrum of,\nwe're never activating these\nstress response pathways\nthat we're supposed to activate.\nWe're supposed to.\n- I find that fascinating, and again,\ndrawing a parallel to the nervous system,\nso what I'm hearing you\nsay is that, historically,\nwe would have to go through some stress,\nsome confront cold or confront heat,\nor confront effort or hunger,\nhave to exercise, essentially,\nin order to obtain these compounds,\nand then those compounds are reparative.\nYeah, I feel that resembles\nthe dopamine pathway.\nI always say there's\nnothing wrong with dopamine.\nPeople think about dopamine\nhits as bad or dopamine is bad.\nThere's absolutely nothing\nwrong with dopamine.\nThe problem is dopamine,\nespecially high levels of dopamine,\nreleased without the need for\neffort to access that dopamine\nis problematic.\nSo a line of cocaine gives\nyou a ton of dopamine\nwith no effort except to ingest the drug,\nwhereas working for four years\nor more to get your degree\nwill release a lot of dopamine\nand a lot of cortisol\nalong the way, as we know,\nand it's considered a healthy\naccomplishment in most cases,\na tremendous amount.\nWe're approaching the spring,\nand there'll be a lot of graduations.\nWeddings are coming up\nnow that the pandemic\nis hopefully slowing.\nAnd there'll be a lot of dopamine.\nHigh levels of dopamine are great,\nbut only after the effort\nof having done something\nin order to access it.\nAnd so that's what I'm taking\naway from what you're saying\nis that we need to go\nthrough this intermittent,\ndifferent types of intermittent challenge,\nand we are rewarded with\nparticular compounds\nthat are reparative,\nboth for the challenge,\nbut then make us stronger.\nHormesis really is, it seems,\na case of what doesn't\nkill us, makes us stronger.\nSo you mentioned-\n- Can I add to that\none thing you just said?\n- [Andrew] Please, please.\n- Because this has been shown\nwith, for example,\nsulforaphane in animal studies,\nyou precondition, give\nthe animal sulforaphane,\nand then you expose them to hypoxia\nor some kind of ischemic stroke condition,\nwhatever they do to induce that,\nand the sulforaphane, it\nbasically protects them.\nTheir precondition\nand their stress response\npathways are primed,\nand so, when they're then\nexposed to the ischemic stroke,\ntheir outcomes are so much\nbetter, so much better\nthan the animals that\ndidn't get the sulforaphane\n48 hours before or whatever it was.\nAnd this has been shown\nin multiple animal studies\nwith sulforaphane\nspecifically in the brain.\nI know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark Mattson.\nHe's often thought of as the\nintermittent fasting king,\nbut he's a neuroscientist,\nand he did publish some work\nand talks about sulforaphane as well.\n- I'm really glad you brought\nthat up, that example up,\nbecause many of the questions\nI get on social media\nand elsewhere are about\ntraumatic brain injury.\nAnd TBI is just one example.\nAnd people always think,\n\"Oh, sports. It's football.\"\nWhenever you say TBI, people\nalways think football.\nAnd I just want to just take\na moment to editorialize.\n90% or more of traumatic brain injury\nis construction work, at-home accidents.\nFootball players, hockey\nplayers, martial artists\nare a tiny fraction of\nthe people who have TBI\nand concussion of various kinds.\nIt just so happens that,\nwithin those communities,\nmany of them, 75% or\nmore, experience those.\nSo it's salient within those communities,\nbut concussion is prominent.\nPeople are always asking, \"What can I do\n\"in order to offset brain injury?\n\"I had a concussion two\nyears ago. What can I do?\"\nAnd it's been a tough question\nbecause we really don't\nhave anything for them.\nI mean, you tell them sleep\nwell, eat well, exercise,\nbut it sounds like some of\nthese reparative pathways\neither should be explored in\nthe context of brain injury\nor, I'm guessing, are being explored\nin the context of brain injury.\n- Yeah, so a couple of things there.\nOne is that, I mean,\ntraumatic brain injury,\nit's terrible, but it's so interesting\nbecause it's also like\nliteral, real-time brain aging.\nYou're able to accelerate\nit and understand.\nSo I often think of, when I\nthink of traumatic brain injury,\nI think of so much overlap\nbetween Alzheimer's disease\nand dementia and these\nneurodegenerative diseases\nbecause there are a lot\nof similarities there.\nAnd so, sulforaphane, I personally think,\nand I do think there's\nbeen some animal research\nwith TBI and sulforaphane,\nmostly preconditioning\nrather than treatment.\nSo, again, it's like, well,\nif you want a healthy lifestyle thing\nand you're a construction worker,\nor you're fill in the\nblank, that's going to.\nI mean, anyone that drives a car,\nyou're at risk to some degree, right?\n- [Andrew] Or bicycle.\n- Bicycle, yeah.\n- Around Stanford, I would say\npeople demonize motorcycles,\npeople demonize a lot of things,\nbut moving fast through\nspace on a small object\nnext to a 3,000 pound vehicle,\nI mean, we have a number\nof friends that have died.\nWe have a number of people\nwith traumatic brain injury.\nI'm not against cycling or cyclists,\nbut it's a risky sport by any stretch.\nSo, in taking things like moringa\nor eating my broccoli sprouts,\nmaybe cooking them a little less\nthan I'm currently cooking them,\nputting on the mustard seed.\nIs there evidence that?\nWell, first of all, Nrf2\nis expressed in neurons,\nso those cells should be protected.\nAre there other cells of the body\nthat could possibly gain\nprotection from these pathways?\n- Well, lungs for one, but\njust even in plasma cells.\nI think Nrf2 is pretty\nubiquitously expressed.\nLiver.\nThere's so many animal studies\nthat have looked at all those things.\nI try to kind of gravitate\ntowards human ones\n'cause it's a lot more relevant.\nBut I think, overall, like I mentioned,\nDNA damage lower.\nIt was like 24 or 34%\nlower in human blood cells\nafter broccoli sprout\npowder supplementation.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- And I made a video on\nthis years ago, 2016 maybe,\nand I think I have the references\non there to exact amounts.\nI can't remember.\n- We can link to the video.\n- But it's kind of an\nold video. It's 2016.\nBut I also had Jed on the podcast,\nand he did talk about this.\nBut it's also been shown in\nrandomized controlled trials\nto help treat autism\nand autistic symptoms.\nYet again, it's doing\ninteresting things in the brain,\nand I think it does have something to do\nwith the oxidative\nstress, the glutathione,\nwhich would be relevant for TBI treatment.\nIt hasn't been shown empirically\nthat that helps with treatment,\nbut I do think someone\ncould do that study.\nI think that it should be done, honestly,\nbecause it's a low-hanging fruit,\nI mean, if there's any impact.\nAnd there is at least\none preliminary study\nthat glutathione is increased in the brain\nafter humans are basically\ntaking sulforaphane.\n- Which is, really, for people listening,\nthat's so important because\na number of compounds\nthat people take in supplement form\ndon't cross the blood-brain barrier,\nor they get metabolized in ways\nthat what's listed on the\nbottle almost becomes irrelevant\nfor what your cells actually experience.\nSo that's very reassuring.\nWe will get back to heat and cold\nand this theme that I tried to surface,\nbut I just find this too interesting\nto diverge at this\npoint from these themes.\nSo, what other compounds or micronutrients\ndo you place in the top\ntier of useful, interesting?\nThere are animal studies.\nMaybe there are hopefully\nalso some human studies.\nWe've talked about a few.\nI know you've talked a lot\nabout omega-3 fatty acids.\nSo, if you had to do your top three,\nyour superstars of nutrients\nfor the brain and body,\nsounds like we've got one set,\nwhat would you put alongside them?\n- Omega-3, the marine omega-3 fatty acids.\nSo these are found in\nmarine types of animals,\nfish, cold water fish, fatty fish.\nSo there's three fatty acids.\nThere's one from a plant,\nand that's often referred to\nas ALA, people call it short,\nalpha-linolenic acid,\nand then there's\neicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA,\nand docosahexaenoic acid, which is DHA.\nYeah, but EPA-\n- I'm amazed you can pronounce\ntwo of the most difficult\nwords to pronounce and spell\nright next to ophthalmology,\nwhich, if you can spell it.\nI know people who have appointments\nin ophthalmology departments\nthat don't know how to\nspell ophthalmology.\nLittle secret. There's\nan extra P in there.\nSo the ALA.\nI'm not going to attempt to pronounce it\nbecause your pronunciation was perfect\nof both of these two compounds.\nAnd you said are marine sources, so fish,\nso sardines, cod, this sort of\nthing, but what about krill?\nI've seen krill oil.\nA few years back, people were saying krill\nis a better source for\nomega-3s than is fish oil.\nI took some krill oil capsules,\nmade me itch all over, so I stopped.\n- Do you have a shellfish allergy?\n- No, I don't think so.\n- No, okay.\n- I don't think so.\nI'm not a big fan of shellfish,\nbut I'll have oysters every now and again,\nor shrimp or something, and feel fine.\n- Yeah, we can talk about sources.\nSo krill is a source\nmostly of a type of DHA and EPA\nthat's in phospholipid form.\nSo it's a phosphatidylcholine\nomega-3 fatty acid,\nand that's different than most of the,\nwell, if we're talking\nabout fish oil supplements,\nthat's a different story,\nbut if you're talking about comparing fish\nto eating krill, like we're\ntalking about the food.\n- Oh, I would never eat krill.\n- Okay. Are we talking\nabout the supplements?\n- Yes, I apologize.\n- Fish oil supplements.\n- Yeah, krill supplement\nversus fish oil supplement,\nand, if it fits in the conversation,\ntalking about great sources of\nomega-3s in their whole form.\nI have a bad feeling you're\ngoing to tell me sardines.\n- Sardines are, yeah,\nthey're awesome. Anyways.\n- Except for the taste.\n- And for the potential contaminants.\nMercury, I think, was one.\nNo. Yeah, it was mercury.\nAnd Joe was telling me about,\nhe used to eat sardines everyday.\nJoe Rogan was telling me\nthat he used to eat sardines every day,\nand then he had really\nhigh mercury levels.\nAnd I was really shocked\nbecause sardines are low\nin the fish groups.\nThe higher up you get,\nlike swordfish and sharks,\nlike, really high mercury\n'cause they're eating all\nthe other fish, right?\nBut I think some brands,\nand if you look at ConsumerLab.\nConsumerLab, it's like a third-party site\nthat I'm not affiliated with,\nbut I'll use them because\nthey do a lot of analysis\nof different foods and supplements.\nAnd so you can look at\nsome of their sardines,\nand they have a list of\nones that are pretty decent.\nBut, anyways, back to your question\nabout fish oil supplements\nversus krill oil supplements.\nSo one of the major differences\nis that fish oil supplements,\nif you get a high quality one,\nit's in a triglyceride form.\nSo you've got a glycerol backbone\nwith three fatty acids that's attached,\nand those are either DHA or the EPA.\nOr, if you have a lower\nquality fish oil supplement,\nthen you have what's\ncalled ethyl ester form.\nAnd, typically, the reason for that,\nwhen fish oil is purified,\nit's run through this column\nwith alcohol or something.\nThey cleave it off, the glycerol backbone,\nand then it's just kind of\neasier to leave it like that\nthan re-esterifying it,\nwhich costs more money.\nSo you can get it in ethyl ester form,\nwhich isn't as bioavailable.\nAnd, in fact, if you\ndon't take it with food,\nyou're going to be in trouble.\nYou're not going to\nabsorb much of it at all.\n- Would you see this on the packaging?\nIs it going to say it's\nin this ethyl form?\n- Some official brands will\nput it on their website,\nperhaps on their packaging,\nbut, most of the time,\nyou'll have to dig for it\non the website and/or call them.\nBut I think, for the most part,\nones that are higher end will market it,\nlike triglyceride form.\nAnd it's not that ethyl ester's bad.\nIt just means take it with food.\nSo one of the major prescription\nomega-3s out there is,\nboth of them actually, Lovaza,\nwhich is a mixture of DHA and EPA,\nas well as Vascepa, which\nis a highly purified EPA.\nThese are both prescribed by physicians\nto patients with hypertriglyceridemia,\nso high triglycerides among other things,\nI think maybe dysregulation\nof lipids as well.\n- This is amazing.\nFor people, so these\nare prescription drugs\nthat are essentially very\nhigh-potency, purified omega-3s,\nbut they're given to\npeople for lipid issues.\nSo this is the treatment of\nissues with fat metabolism\nby giving people fat.\n- Yes.\n- I just want to push home,\nagain, I'm not carnivore keto\nor anything, I'm an omnivore,\nbut to just push home that\none thing that's so wonderful\nthat you've done over the\nyears and you continue to do\nis to move away from these\nvery broad, sweeping statements\nabout fat is bad.\nHere's a case where we're\nsaying fat is not only good,\nit can be used to combat\nissues with fat metabolism.\nAnd fats are not just one\nthing. They're many things.\nSo anyway, I just want to\nput a little highlighter\nand a point of appreciation there\nand make sure that people are\nsensitized to the fact that,\nif you hear that fat is bad,\nyou have to ask, what kind of fat?\nAnd here we're talking\nabout these omega-3s.\nOkay, so the triglyceride form\ncan be taken with or without food,\nand there's prescription forms.\nI don't know if I can get ahold\nof the prescription form unless-\n- You have high triglycerides.\n- Or I have a friend\nwith high triglycerides.\nNo. It's illegal, folks.\nDon't share prescription drugs.\n- Or you talk to your doctor and you say,\n\"I'm already taking this from...\"\nI mean, I don't know\nhow it works. Anyways.\n- What's the dosage that\nyou recommend people get?\nOne way or another.\n- All right, okay, so the\ndosage that physicians prescribe\nfor high triglycerides, for\nexample, is four grams a day.\n- Four grams of EPA.\n- Yes, of the Vascepa.\nI think Lovaza's also\nprescribed at four grams a day.\nAnd you can get either of\nthose from your physician.\nMy father-in-law just got\none of 'em prescribed.\nWe were buying our own\nomega-3 for years and years.\nIt's like, hey, you can actually get this\nand health insurance can cover it.\nAnd it's a really purified form,\nbut you have to take it with\nfood. That was the bottom line.\nI've totally gone on tangents,\nbut you're asking more\ninteresting questions anyway.\n- Well, normally I ask about mechanism\nand then I talk about\nprotocols, but in the-\n- Or the why.\n- [Andrew] Or the why.\n- I mean, we haven't gotten there yet.\n- And we definitely will get there,\nbut I think a number of people nowadays\nare just really excited\nabout what they can do\nfor their health, and so, here,\nwe're just raising the\nimportance of omega-3s,\nand then we'll definitely get to the why\nand the underlying mechanism.\n- Yeah, I think four grams is,\nI mean, in fact,\nBill Harris, Dr. Bill Harris,\nhe's just one of the pioneers\non omega-3 fatty acid research.\nHe was on our podcast last August.\nAnd he was saying the reason\nFDA chose that was literally\njust because how much they\ncould get people to take.\nIt wasn't like an upper end,\nlike anything above that is unsafe.\nThat wasn't the case.\nI mean, it was just purely cost\nand compliance,\nso what they can get into a\npill, the amount they can get,\nand how many pills they\ncan get people to take.\n- I'm smiling because our\ngood friend Satchin Panda\nat the Salk Institute,\nwho's done a lot of important\nwork on intermittent fasting\nand other incredible work on\ncircadian rhythms, et cetera.\nWhen I was talking to him\nin preparation for an episode\non intermittent fasting,\nI said, \"Why the\neight-hour feeding window?\"\nAnd he said, \"Well, the graduate student\n\"who ran those studies had a partner.\"\nI think it was a girlfriend, as I recall.\nHope I didn't get that backward.\nAnd the partner said,\n\"Listen, you can be in lab\n\"10 hours a day, but you\ncan't be in lab 14 hours a day\n\"if you want this relationship to work.\"\nAnd so it was eight\nhours of feeding window,\nplus some measurements and\ntime to walk into the lab,\npark the car, et cetera.\nAnd so the eight-hour feeding window\nthat everyone holds so holy\nwas actually just born\nout of this relationship\nbetween these two graduate students.\nHad they been single,\nI was single all through graduate school,\nor most of it anyway,\nand I lived in the lab.\nSo, if it'd been me, intermittent fasting\nwould mean eating 14 hours a day.\nThat was a joke.\nNot a good one, but just want\nto make clear. I'm joking.\nBut the point that you're\nmaking is a really good one,\nthat the four gram amount\nis not a threshold based on anything\nexcept the threshold\nof people's willingness\nto actually take this stuff.\nAnd I think that's important\nfor people to hear.\nBecause so often we hear the\neight-hour feeding window,\nfour grams of EPA, 150 minutes of cardio,\nand it's really a question\nof what you can reasonably do\nin a study.\n- So I take four grams a day.\nI take two in the morning,\ntwo grams in the morning,\nand I take two grams in the evening.\nI take my EPA in the morning,\nand I take my DHA in the evening.\n- You split them.\n- I do.\nI don't know.\nI don't think it's necessary, necessarily.\nI just happen to get a\ncertain fish oil supplement\nthat separates them.\nAnd so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's a great one,\nand it's all in one, and it's easier.\n- What if someone doesn't\nhave a prescription?\nSo I take over-the-counter fish oil.\nI know I feel better\n'cause I've done the\nexperiment of going on and off.\nI take them mainly for,\nI don't have depression,\nbut my mood is better.\nMy joints feel better. I just feel better.\nAnd I like to think that my\nplatelets are slipperier,\nand they're cruising through\nany little obstructions\nin my veins or arteries.\nThat's the image I have in my head,\nbut I don't have any data\nto support that part.\n- Yeah, I mean, so, if\nyou're asking for, like,\nwhere do people get these\nfish oil supplements?\n- Let's say I look at the bottle,\nand it says two grams per serving,\nbut then I look, and it's\n750 milligrams of EPA\nor 1,000 milligrams of EPA.\nLet's say half of it is EPA.\nThen, do I want to hit a threshold of EPA\nor a threshold of what's\nlisted on the bottle,\non the front of the bottle?\nBecause my understanding\nis that we need to hit\na threshold level of EPA\nin order to derive these\nimportant benefits.\n- I think two grams is a good threshold.\nNow, the International\nFish Oil Standards, IFSO,\nthey have a website where\nthey do third-party testing\nof a ton of different fish oil supplements\nfrom around the world, and\nthey measure the concentration\nof the omega-3 fatty acids\nin the actual supplement,\nbecause nothing is ever\nwhat it says on the bottle,\nand then they also measure contaminants,\nso mercury, PCBs, dioxins,\nthings that you'd find potentially in fish\nthat are harmful to humans,\nand they also measure mercury\nand then oxidized fatty acids.\nSo these omega-3 fatty acids\nare polyunsaturated fatty acids,\nwhich are extremely prone to oxidation.\nSo please keep your fish\noil in the refrigerator\nbecause it's colder.\nYeah, they're extremely prone.\n- Mine's in the cupboard,\nso now I know.\n- The shelf life's\nincreased. Lower oxidation.\n- No, it makes perfect sense. Yeah.\n- So, anyways, they measure that.\nAnd I typically like to look for,\nthey give you a total oxidation number.\nIt's called T-O-T-O-X.\nTOTOX is what we call it for short.\nAnd I like it to be at the least under 10,\nideally under six.\nIt's really hard to find all\nthe right mixtures of things,\nbut people can go to this website,\nand they can browse through the products.\nI've put together an Excel sheet,\nwhich I have a YouTube little screencast\nthat I'm yet to publish,\npress the publish button on,\nbut it, basically,\nyou have to go back and check and update\n'cause these are from different\nlot numbers of the products.\nThey do have up to like\n20, 27 or something.\nAnd so I've gone through\nand found my top picks\nof high EPA brands and high DHA brands.\nIf I were to buy some, the\nones that I would choose\nbecause of the low total oxidation\nand the high concentration\nof either EPA or DHA.\nNow, people can go and do this themselves.\nIt just takes some work.\n- No, I'm glad that you did the work.\nI'm going to put up a tweet every week.\n- Oh no!\n- With you tagged until this\nlist is published online.\nSorry, Rhonda, but I'm going to do it.\nI know it's very sadistic of me,\nbut in service to the community\nand myself.\n- Yes,\nand I chose five brands from each,\nand I tried to find one in Europe\nand one in Canada.\n- Great.\n- So there's a great selection\nof US and other.\n- Thank you\nfor doing that work.\nI don't want to do that\nwork, and I trust you.\nSo, yeah, I try and get\ntwo grams per day of EPA\nfrom supplementation.\nI'll now put it in the refrigerator.\nMood is better.\nI made that decision\nmainly based on the data\nthat I'm aware of,\nlooking at comparison of people doing that\nanywhere from two to\nfour grams of EPA per day\ncompared to SSRIs, selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors,\nin treatment of depression,\nand I don't want to take\nan SSRI if I don't have to,\nand fortunately, I don't have to,\nbut the data, by my read, are remarkable.\nPeople that take these\nthings in sufficient doses,\nmeaning the EPAs,\nare able to get by with much lower dosages\nof SSRIs for depression relief\nor, in some cases, to come\noff their SSRIs completely\nor avoid going on\nantidepressant medication.\nNow, of course, this is not\nsomething people should cowboy.\nMental health issues are serious.\nBut what other reasons,\nI'd love your thoughts on that,\non the mental health part,\nso maybe you could tell\nus what are some things\nthat getting to two to\nfour grams of EPA per day\nis going to help with in our\nbrain and the rest of our body.\n- So, do you know?\nSo I actually published\na paper back in 2015\nabout the role of omega-3\nand vitamin D in depression,\nbipolar disorder, schizophrenia,\nand impulsive behavior.\nBut, so, within that paper,\ndoing background research,\nand this was a review article, by the way,\nI was just connecting dots\n'cause I love doing that.\n- I'm going to grab that paper.\nI confess, I don't know the paper,\nbut I love quality reviews\nbecause the references\nthey're in are so useful.\n- Well, there's a huge\nrole for inflammation,\nthe cause of inflammation in depression.\nAnd I think we did a short\nanimated video on this as well,\nyears ago, back when I\nwas publishing that work,\nwhere people are injected\nwith lipopolysaccharide.\nThis is something that we're\ngenerating from our gut,\nmostly from our gut permeability,\nwhich happens a lot.\nEndotoxin, it's also called.\nIt's endotoxin lipopolysaccharide.\nIt's basically the outer\nmembrane of bacterial cells\nwhen bacteria die, so like when\nthe immune cells in our gut\ncome into contact with the bacteria\nbecause we drank alcohol five\ndays in a row or whatever,\nwe release endotoxin, or\nsomething stressed us out.\nWe release endotoxin into our body,\nand that causes inflammation.\nAnd so you can inject people\nwith lipopolysaccharide\nand cause depressive symptoms.\nHowever, if you take those\nsame cohort of people,\ngive them EPA,\nand I think it was\nsomewhere around two grams,\nand then inject them\nwith lipopolysaccharide.\nWe're establishing causation here, right?\nIt totally, the depressive\nsymptoms, versus a placebo.\nSo the placebo was saline control.\nSo this was a placebo controlled\nbecause obviously it's hugely\nimportant for depression.\nIt ameliorated the depressive symptoms\nthat was caused by lipopolysaccharide.\n- Amazing, and LPS,\nlipopolysaccharide, is no joke.\nYears ago, when I was working\non thermal regulation,\nwe would inject animals\nwith LPS to induce fever.\nThe vagus nerve registers\nthe presence of LPS signals\nto these particular hyperglycemic areas\nand cranks up body temperature\nbecause, basically, it's a\nsignal that the body is infected.\nAmazing.\nSo I will continue with\nmy two grams per day.\nMaybe I'll ramp it up to four.\nI'm not doing the DHA separately.\nThere's DHA\nin the same supplement.\n- Yes.\n- [Andrew] Is that okay?\n- Yes. Yeah, yeah.\nAnd to kind of...\nBoy, we've got a lot of\nthings to hit back on\nbecause one of your original questions\nwas krill oil versus fish oil.\n- Yes, still in the cue.\n- DHA, specifically,\nin phospholipid form,\nit's more bioavailable.\nSo, if you're comparing exact\nquantity or concentration\nin triglyceride form\nversus phospholipid form,\nyou will get more in your plasma cells,\nin your plasma, plasma cell,\nin your plasma with krill oil.\nHowever, krill oil\nsupplements are so low dose.\nI mean, good luck getting two grams\nof omega-3 from krill oil.\nAnd also, krill oil supplements\nare notoriously rancid.\nI don't know for whatever reason.\n- Maybe that's what\nmade me itchy all over.\n- I think they're just...\nI haven't found a good\nkrill oil supplement.\nI pretty much stay away from it.\nI mean, if you smell it too,\nI mean, it just smells rancid.\nSo, but the thing is,\nand I also published a\npaper on this back in 2019,\nyeah, something like that,\nabout DHA in phospholipid\nform getting into the brain\nthrough a different mechanism\nthan DHA in triglyceride form.\nAnd so it's going through a transporter\ncalled the MFSD2A transporter.\nAnd I think it's very relevant for people\nwith an APOE4 allele, so-\n- People with an\nAlzheimer's susceptibility.\n- Right, so like 25% of the\npopulation has an allele\nand a gene called APOE4,\nand, basically, it's APOE,\nbut the four is referred to\nas the bad kind of version of it.\nThis is something in our\nbodies. It's also in our brain.\nAnd if people have one of these versions,\nif they got one from\ntheir mom or their dad,\nthey have a twofold increased\nrisk for Alzheimer's disease.\nIf they get two, which is much more,\nit's less common.\nI think it's like 2% of\nthe population or something\nhas two alleles, but they have like a 10\nor 11-fold increased risk\nof Alzheimer's disease.\nSo there is a role for\nphospholipid form DHA in the brain,\nbut you also make phospholipid\nDHA inside your body.\nAnd you can do that by taking\nin more triglyceride forms.\nSo two grams or more is\nthe magic number, I think.\nSo kind of back to the why for fish oil.\nI personally think it is\none of the most powerful,\nanti-inflammatory things,\ndietary lifestyle,\nthings that we can get\neasily, relatively easily,\nthat is going to powerfully\nmodulate the way you think,\nthe way you feel, and the way you age.\nAnd a variety of\ndifferent types of studies\nkind of led me to that conclusion,\na variety of observational studies.\nSo there's been lots of\nwork by Dr. Bill Harris\nand his collaborators looking at,\nit's called the Omega-3 Index.\nSo this is actually the omega-3\nlevel in red blood cells.\nSo red blood cells turn\nover about every 120 days.\nSo it's a long-term\nmarker of omega-3 status.\nThis is very different from\n99.9% of any study you see\nor any lab that you go to to\nget your omega-3 levels tested.\nYou're getting your plasma\nphospholipid levels tested,\nwhich is kind of like\nyou can think of it as,\nwhat did I eat a couple days before?\nOh, I had fish. My\nomega-3 levels are great.\nBut did you eat fish like that every week,\nor was it like you went out to dinner?\nSo it's not a great biomarker\nfor long-term omega-3 status.\nIt's kind of like the\nfasting blood glucose levels\nversus the HbA1c, which\nis like a long-term marker\nof your blood glucose levels.\nSo the Omega-3 Index.\nHe's done a variety of\nstudies, observational studies.\nSo, for people listening,\nthese are studies that\nare obviously flawed\nbecause they're not\nestablishing causality.\nYou're looking at people's lifestyles.\nBut, in the case of Bill Harris's work,\nhe's measuring something.\nSo he's measuring the Omega-3 Index.\nAnd he's measuring the\nOmega-3 Index in people,\nand then looking at their\nmortality risk, for example,\nor their cardiovascular disease risk.\nAnd what he has found is that,\nfirst of all, standard American diet\nhas an Omega-3 Index of 5%.\nJapan, by contrast, has an Omega-3 Index\nof around 10 to 11%.\nBig difference there.\nAnd they also have about a five-year\nincreased life expectancy\ncompared to people in the US.\n- Do you think that's mainly\ndue to their fish intake,\nseafood intake?\n- So what he showed was,\nI think it's a big part of it.\nI mean, you can't says\nit's the only thing,\nbut what he showed in his data was that,\nand I think it was Framingham Study,\nwhere he looked at the Omega-3 Index,\nand people that had a\nOmega-3 Index of 4% or lower,\nso close to what the standard American is\nbut a little bit lower,\nthey had a five-year\ndecreased life expectancy\ncompared to people that\nhad an 8% Omega-3 Index.\nAnd so big difference there, right?\nFive years life expectancy.\nBut here's the really\ninteresting thing, Andrew.\nHe also looked at smokers,\nsmokers and their omega-3 levels,\nand so he stratified\nit, and he found smokers\nthat had no omega-3 were\nlike the worst of all.\nI mean, it was just like worse, right?\nWe all know smoking is bad for us\nand will take years off\nour life expectancy.\n- [Andrew] Absolutely.\n- But smokers that had the high level,\nlike smokers that were taking\ntheir fish oil or eating fish\nor whatever it was they were\ndoing to get them up to 8%,\nthey had the same life\nexpectancy as non-smokers\nwith the low Omega-3 Index.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- Right?\n- Wow.\nThat's amazing.\nAnd it's also amazing to me\nthat people still smoke cigarettes.\nBut I see a lot of people vaping,\nand I know a lot of\npeople consume cannabis.\nHave there been any studies\nspecifically of vaping\nor people smoking marijuana?\n- Life expectancy?\n- All-cause mortality.\n- I haven't seen those.\nI haven't seen those.\n- They're not motivated enough to come in\nas research subjects.\nThat was, again, a poor joke.\nIt is hard to study people, marijuana use,\nunless, I'm told by my\ncolleagues that study this stuff,\nunless you offer people marijuana,\nin which case they'll do it.\nBut, again, they're actually\nnot very good research subjects\nin all seriousness 'cause\nthey are not very motivated\nor consistent, and they\nforget their appointments.\nSo that's incredible.\nAnd you mentioned that\nthe data on pollution\nrelated to the plant compounds earlier.\nSo it's almost like these things are,\nagain, are acting in a reparative way.\n- The omega-3s are, I mean,\nthey are resolving inflammation.\nThey're blunting inflammation.\nThey're doing so many different.\nThey affect so many different parts\nof the inflammatory pathway,\nwhich is, I think, plays a\nhuge role in the way we age,\nthe way our brain ages, the way we feel,\nour mood, our joints, all that.\nAnd so it's amazing\nthat it's not, you know.\n- I love fish oil. I feel\nbetter when I take it.\nI try to eat some fatty\nfish a couple times a week.\nI do want to just touch on\nfood sources for a moment.\nFirst of all, are there plants\nthat are rich in omega-3s?\nAnd second, I have some friends\nwho are really into meat.\nI like meat a lot, my dad's Argentine,\nbut I don't eat very much of it.\nI try and eat high quality meats\nin relatively limited amounts,\nbut I do eat pretty often.\nBut I've been told by these sources\nof a questionable authority that,\nif an animal grazes on really\ngood grasses, for instance,\nthat the meat can contain\na lot of omega-3s,\nwhich, in principle, makes sense\nbased on this Omega-3 Index.\n'Cause you're telling me\nthat a lot of this omega-3\nis sequestered into the red blood cells.\nSo, if I'm eating high\nquality, grass-fed meat\nand the grasses had omega-3s,\ndo my steaks have omega-3s or no?\n- So there was a study published\nthat compared conventional meat,\nso meat that animals are fed\ncorn or soy or whatever it is.\n- Which is terrible.\n- [Rhonda] Yeah.\n- For animals and people,\nas far as I can tell.\nI'm sure I'll get some\nattacks, but that's okay.\nI won't read those comments.\nAgain, a joke. I read all the comments.\nBut it seems to me that these animals\nhave to either be taking fish oil\nor eat plants that are\nvery rich in omega-3s\nin order for the meat\nto actually contain sufficient omega-3s.\n- So the meat, comparing\nthe conventional meat\nto the grass-fed or\npasture-raised cows or cattle,\nthere were higher levels\nof alpha-linolenic acid.\nAnd ALA, it can be\nconverted into EPA and DHA,\nbut the conversion is very inefficient\nand very dependent on\na variety of factors,\nincluding genetics.\nGenetics, a huge regulator.\nSome people can do it much better.\nOthers, you're getting like\n5% of conversion to EPA.\nEstrogen is a major regulator\nof making that more efficient.\nIt makes sense because pregnancy,\nwhen your estrogen just\ngoes through the roof.\nThese omega-3 fatty acids\nplay a very important role\nin brain development.\nWomen are supposed to be\nconverting any ALA they can\ninto the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids.\nSo estrogen does affect that,\nbut I would say plant sources.\nSo, if you're looking for the ALA,\nplant sources would be walnuts, flaxseeds.\nThose are probably the highest.\nBut, if a person is a\nvegan or a vegetarian,\ntheir best bet is to\nactually get microalgae oil.\nAnd you can supplement with microalgae oil\nbecause microalgae, they do make the DHA.\nAnd so that would be a better source\nfor people that are vegetarian and vegan\nrather than doing the flaxseed oil\nbecause that conversion inefficiency,\nthe enzymes that convert\nALA into EPA and DHA,\nagain, it's inefficient.\n- And then, for people that eat fish,\nsardines, you said.\n- [Rhonda] Salmon.\n- Salmon, and you have to eat\nthe skin, as I understand.\n- You don't have to, but it's good.\n- [Andrew] It's rich with omegas.\n- The oil, yeah.\nAnd the reason I say,\nI think the best would\nbe wild Alaskan salmon\nversus the farm-raised because\nthe farm-raised, again,\nthey're feeding 'em corn.\nThey're feeding 'em grain and stuff.\n- [Andrew] Really?\n- And then, they give 'em astaxanthin.\nSo astaxanthin is a carotenoid.\nIt's the carotenoid that's\nin things like krill,\ncrustaceans that make their red pigment.\n- Yeah, it's also being\nused now as a supplement,\nand there's a prescription form\nto try and rescue some\nage-related vision loss\nbecause of the role of\nthe vitamin A pathway\nand photoreceptors.\n- Yeah, well, actually the\ncarotinoids themselves,\nso like lutein, zeaxathin,\nthey're really good at\nsequestering singlet oxygen,\nwhich is damaging, right?\n- Yeah, as we age,\nbecause the retinal cells,\nthe cells of the eye\nare so metabolically active,\nthey accumulate a lot of\nreactive oxygen species,\nand mitochondrial repair\nand limiting reactive oxygen species\nis a major theme of\ntrying to rescue vision.\nThat's a whole other podcast and story.\nThere's some really interesting data now\non the use of red light to try and trigger\nthese pathways.\n- I've seen some.\nThat's my good friend of many\nyears and amazing scientist\nGlen Jeffery's lab at\nUniversity College London.\nWe should talk about that\nat some point, if not today.\n- I saw that study, like 2020, was it?\n- Now, they have a second study.\n- Oh, do they? They've done, okay.\n- It's looking real.\n- [Rhonda] That's exciting.\n- I mean, they're cautious.\nThey're appropriately British\nand cautious about it.\nI always joke if those studies\nhad been done over here,\neveryone would already know about it.\nGlen is a very conservative guy,\nbut they've done this stuff\nnow in pigs, in rodent models,\nand now also two studies in humans.\nIt's looking pretty interesting.\nSo sardines but also anchovies.\nBy the way, I hate all the\nfood items that I'm describing.\nI can barely tolerate salmon.\nI don't like fish at all.\nActually, I like live fish.\n- So fish oil's good for you.\n- I had fish tanks when I was a kid.\nNo, I find fish, unless\nit's in sushi form,\nI find it absolutely repulsive,\nand I don't know why.\nI probably have some mutation.\n- So raw fish is actually\nhigher in mercury than cooked.\n- Okay, well, that's good.\nI don't really like\nsushi that much anyway.\nYou're giving me great\nreasons to not eat fish,\nexcept I should eat\nthese other fish sources\nor supplement more heavily.\nThat's the message I'm getting.\n- I eat sardines.\nEvery day, my first meal almost\nis a can of sardines and an avocado.\n- Avocado is good.\n- I love it, yeah, with\na little bit of lemon\nand then some little hot sauce.\n- Does avocado have omega-3s?\n- Avocado is very good\nin monounsaturated fat.\nIt's not really high\nin polyunsaturated fat.\nOmega-3, really, it's\neither the DHA and EPA\nthat's in the marine sources fish,\nor it's the plant ALA source,\nwhich is the flaxseed or the walnuts.\n- It's rough.\nI mean, all these companies now\nare making these plant-based\nproducts that taste like meat.\nMy wish is that they\nwould just make a fish\nthat tastes like a steak, but that's-\n- The fish come out albino,\nthe ones that they farm raise,\nbecause they don't eat any of the-\n- I'm joking.\nI don't want a genetically modified fish\nthat tastes like a steak.\nAlthough, I love the taste of steak.\nThe point here is that, if\none doesn't see themselves\nregularly consuming these\nfish sources of omega-3s,\nit seems to me that the\nonly way to really get them\nis from supplementation.\n- And supplementation is a\ngood way to get a high dose.\nAnd to get back to your dose point,\nthere was a couple of\nstudies that, basically,\nI think there was some way\nthey showed that people\nthat are in the 4% Omega-3 Index range,\nin order to get to the 8%,\nthe five-year increased life expectancy\nif we're comparing the two groups,\nwas to supplement with at least two grams.\nIt was about two grams a day.\nAnd I think it was a little bit less\nif it was triglyceride form,\nbut I think two grams\nis a good, safe number.\nSo most Americans that are\nnot eating a lot of fish\nand they're not supplementing\nare probably around a\n4 to 5% Omega-3 Index.\nAnd to get to the 8%.\nAnd I think that's a good empirical way\nof thinking about it, right?\nOkay, well, I want to get to that 8%.\nBy the way, I'm almost 16% Omega-3 Index.\n- Yeah, I was going to ask about testing.\nSo, where and how can somebody\nmeasure their Omega-3 Index?\nWhich, again, just to remind people,\nis essentially the percentage of omega-3s\nthat you have in your blood\nwith the caveat that the Omega-3 Index\nwill be heavily biased by what\nyou ate in the previous days.\n- Not the Omega-3 Index.\nOkay, so, the Omega-3-\n- Sorry, I misunderstood.\nI thought you said, in red blood cells,\nif I ate salmon two days ago,\nmy Omega-3 Index is going to go up.\n- No, that was plasma.\n- [Andrew] I misunderstood.\n- So most people are measuring,\nif you look at a lot of\nstudies, and honestly, Andrew,\nI think a lot of the\nreason for conflicting data\nis because people are measuring\nplasma omega-3 levels.\n- [Andrew] Okay.\n- The phospholipids. It's\nin a phospholipid, right?\nYour phospholipids are carrying things.\nThese are lipoproteins.\nThey're carrying things like omega-3\nand triglycerides and stuff\nand shuttling 'em around.\nThe Omega-3 Index is actually\nin the red blood cells,\nand red blood cells take\n120 days to turn over.\nSo, if you're going to do a baseline test,\nif you want to know before\nsupplementing what your level is,\nyou have to wait 120 days\nbefore doing the second test\nafter supplementing to\nknow how much you went up\nbecause that's how long it takes\nfor your red blood cell to turn over.\nSo the Omega-3 Index.\nBill Harris has a company\nthat he co-founded.\nIt's called OmegaQuant,\nand they measure the Omega-3 Index.\nThey have a variety of\ndifferent index tests.\nYou can do a basic one or\na little more advanced.\n- This is from a blood draw.\n- It's a little blood spot thing, yeah.\nAnd he uses money to funnel\nback into doing lipid research.\nHe's out there doing all\nsorts of interesting studies\non omega-3s, so it's great.\nBut the Omega-3 Index is great.\nI think that, honestly, more people\nand more researchers should be using it\nbecause the conflicting data,\nit always comes down to\nwhat we're measuring,\nthe sensitivity of it.\nAre we even measuring anything?\nSo you're giving someone\n500 milligrams of DHA,\nand you don't see any effect.\nWell, did you measure\nwhat their levels were?\nAnd did you measure the Omega-3 Index?\nThere's all sorts of problems\nwith randomized controlled trials,\nand I think that we\nneed to, as scientists,\nwe need to come together\nand make some progress.\nI mean, you know? Let's\nall talk to each other.\nLet's figure things out.\nThis test is out there. It should be used.\nIt should be used not just by\nBill's group, but everyone.\n- Yeah, well, and I'm\nlearning so much from you.\nAnd I agree we need more collaboration.\nI've always enjoyed really\nfruitful collaborations\nin my lab at Stanford.\nCollaborating is just so much more fun.\nOnline, there seems to be a\nbias more towards creating silos\nas opposed to bridges,\nbut I appreciate that\nyou bring up the need\nfor more collaboration.\nAnd knowing which measures are best,\nand, in this case, now, thank\nyou for the clarification,\nI understand this Omega-3\nIndex is going to be best.\nSo, basically, now, when I look at you,\nI think, you are 16% omega-3.\n- And dolphins are 19%. I'm almost-\n- Is that your goal?\nYou're trying to get there.\n- It is. [laughs]\n- Interesting.\nActually, they should\nprobably do something\nwhere you're trying to\nachieve the omega-3 ratio\nof your favorite species.\nNow that we've covered a bit\nof how to get these things\ninto one system, depending\non what one eats, et cetera,\nand some of the better measurements,\nhow is omega-3 and some of\nthese other related lipids,\nhow are they having\nthese positive effects?\nIn my mind, and this is\nincredibly elementary,\nbut my understanding\nis that, at some level,\nthey're making platelets more slippery.\nIs that true or not?\nI'm happy to be wrong.\nHow is it possibly impacting my mood?\nIs it through the synthesis\nof membrane on neurons\nthat allows neurons to\nrelease more transmitter,\nlike serotonin and dopamine?\nWhat are some of the purported, reported,\nand known mechanisms?\n- I think some of the\nmost well-known mechanisms\ndo have to do with the omega-3 fatty acids\nbeing very powerful regulators\nof the inflammatory process\nin some way, shape, or form,\nwhether that has to do with\nresolvins that are produced\nfrom the metabolites of DHA, for example.\nResolvins play a role in\nresolving inflammation.\nYou want your inflammatory\nresponse to be activated\nwhen it's supposed to be,\nbut you want to resolve that inflammation\nand the inflammatory response\nin a timely manner, right?\nAnd resolvins help do that.\nAnd so resolvins are one,\nand then there's these specialized\npro-mediating molecules,\nthe SPMs, that also help\nresolve the inflammation.\nThere's, like you mentioned,\nthe leukotrienes and prostaglandins,\nand these things are\nbeing affected by EPA,\nand they do affect platelets\nand platelet aggregation,\nand they do affect that\nwhole pathway as well.\nI think there's just so many\ndifferent ways and inputs.\nAnd so, when we talk about inflammation,\nhonestly, that's a big general term,\nbut when you're talking\nabout serotonin release\nat the level of neurons,\nwe know that these inflammatory molecules\ncross the blood-brain barrier.\nI just mentioned ago\nabout injecting people\nwith lipopolysaccharide and\ncausing and depressive symptoms.\nIt's known that omega-3,\nactually specifically EPA,\nis able to help serotonin.\nInflammation inhibits\nthe release of serotonin,\nand so EPA is actually able to\nblunt inflammatory responses\nalong with DHA as well.\nDHA does that through resolvins and stuff.\nAnd this then helps more\nserotonin be released\nbecause you're not having\nso much inflammation\ngetting into the brain\nand affecting serotonin release, right?\nThat's one mechanism.\nAnd then, another would be,\nwell, DHA itself has been shown,\nit's a very important fatty acid\nthat makes up cell membranes,\nmany cell membranes,\nincluding in our neurons.\nAnd, as you very well know, Andrew,\nthe structure and function\nof receptors of transporters,\nthese membrane-bound proteins\non the surface of our cells,\nincluding neurons,\nare affected by the membrane fluidity,\nlike how rigid and how\nfluid the cell membrane is,\nand DHA plays a role in that.\nAnd so, for example, in animal studies,\nif you make an animal deficient in DHA,\ntheir serotonin receptors,\ndopamine receptors,\nthey're affected because the\nstructure of them is affected\nthrough the fluidity of the membrane.\nAnd so I think that's another mechanism.\nAnd I'm talking sort of general\n'cause I'm not a neuroscientist.\n- No, but it makes perfect sense.\nWe know, for instance,\nneuroplasticity almost always\ninvolves the recruitment of more receptors\nor an improvement in some feature\nof receptors to neurotransmitters.\nAnd they literally move\nlaterally in the membrane.\nThey kind of float\naround like little rafts.\nSometimes they are, in\nfact, in lipid rafts.\nSo it makes perfect sense\nthat these molecules like DHA,\nwhich are part of the\nstructural fat of the neuron,\nbecause, of course,\nthe outsides of neurons\nare basically fat,\nnot just the myelin that\npeople have heard of,\nbut the actual membranes,\nthat getting that right,\nyou wouldn't want it as rigid as concrete,\nbut you wouldn't want it as soft as...\nNeed to come up with something here.\nWhat's that gooey stuff\nthat kids play with?\nIt's like that goo. Anyway.\n- Oh, yeah.\n- Yeah, it's disgusting,\nand it's too soft to be\na membrane for a neuron.\n- You get it in those machines,\nlike the claw machines.\n- Someone put it in the comments\nand tell me what that\ndisgusting gooey stuff is.\nYou don't want your\nneurons to be that gooey,\nand yet you don't want them\nto be like concrete either.\n- It's a balance. Yeah.\n- It's a balance.\nAnd, in mentioning DHA, I\nrealize I'm backtracking,\nbut I want to make sure that we close\nall the hatches for people.\nWe talked a lot about EPA,\nbut are food sources of DHA\nthat you find particularly attractive,\neither by taste or by potency for DHA,\nwhat are just a few\nthat we could throw out?\nBecause I am aware that\nthere are supplements\nwhere you can get a nice\nratio of EPA to DHA,\nor you take them separately, as you do.\nBut if I want to make sure\nthat I'm getting enough DHA,\nwhat do I need to be sure I'm\neating on a regular basis?\n- Well, the fish is packaging\nthe DHA and EPA in the ratio,\nbut I also do eat salmon\nroe, which is very salty,\nand it's a really high source\nof the phosphatidylcholine DHA\nthat we talked about.\n- So this is fish eggs.\n- It is, and actually-\n- [Andrew] That I like for some reason.\n- Oh, do you?\n- Yeah, so I'm discovering\nsomething about myself.\nThis was not meant to be\nnutritional psychotherapy,\nbut you're doing that for me anyway.\nI'm discovering that, yeah,\nI like eating embryonic fish.\nI just don't like eating the actual fish.\n- Okay, well.\n- Okay, so fish eggs are\nokay. So caviar, basically.\n- Caviar, yes.\nAnd that's a good source\nof the phospholipid form.\nAnd I was consuming that a lot\nbecause I wanted to get\nthe phospholipid form.\n- [Andrew] Yum!\n- And it's actually really good.\nThere's been some animal studies\nin piglets and rodents as well\nshowing that consuming phospholipid DHA\nduring fetal brain development\ngets like 10 times more DHA in the brain.\nAgain, it's-\n- Makes sense based on fetal development.\nSo, do I need to buy beluga caviar?\nStuff can get pretty expensive\nat $200 a tin.\n- I don't think you need to.\nI think it's a matter of preference.\nAnd if you're supplementing\nwith your two to four grams of fish oil,\nI mean, you're going to get\nphospholipid form anyway\n'cause your body's going to make it.\n- Okay, I've seen some containers\nof what I assume to be quality fish eggs\nthat are not at the caviar level\nthat you can find in the\nbetter grocery stores\nthat aren't super expensive.\n- [Rhonda] Right.\n- I wouldn't dip as low as to go eat,\nfor instance, like fishing bait.\nLike, when we were kids,\nwe used to go fishing,\nand you'd put the fish egg on the thing.\nThat's probably not good.\n- No.\n- Although it's good enough\nfor the fish apparently. Okay.\nOnly half joking here, folks.\nI'm just trying to protect\nyou from yourselves.\nDon't get any crazy ideas\nabout eating fishing bait.\nOkay, so that's great to know.\nSo we have these plant-based compounds,\nwe have the omega-3s, so EPA, DHA,\nand then you mentioned\nthere's a third category.\nWhat would you place\nin your third category\nof foods or supplement-based nutrients\nthat our health, brain and/or body health,\ncan really benefit from?\n- I mean, I think the most\nobvious would be vitamin D,\nwhich is actually, as you\nknow, a steroid hormone\nthat we produce when we're in the sun.\nDepending on the time of year,\nwe can make it in our skin.\nAnd depending on how much\nmelanin we have on our skin,\nor whether or not we're wearing\nsunscreen or how old we are,\nthere's a sliding scale on\nhow efficient that process is.\n- As I understand, there's\nan inverse relationship,\nwhere the darker your skin is naturally,\nthe more vitamin D you need to consume.\nIs that right?\n- Well, the darker your\nskin is, the harder it is.\nSo there was a study out of\nthe University of Chicago,\nthis was several years ago,\nwhere they looked at African Americans\nand compared African\nAmericans to Caucasians\nwith light skin, fair skin,\nand how well they could make\nvitamin D from sun exposure,\nand how long they had to be\nin the sun to make X amount.\nAnd it turns out that African Americans\nwith darker pigmentation,\nwhich protects them from\nthe burning rays of the sun,\nit's a natural sunscreen,\nhad to stay in the sun six times as long\nas someone with none of\nthat natural sunscreen.\nSo I think the take-home\nthere is a lot of people\nwith darker skin living\nin Sub-Saharan Africa,\nor people living in\nIndia with darker skin,\nor in the Philippines,\nyou know, these equatorial regions\nwhere you tend to see darker skin\nbecause it's protection from\nthe burning rays of the sun.\n- An adaptation.\n- They are in the sun more,\nand they're getting more vitamin D,\nbut people that maybe\nmoved to United States,\nto like Minnesota, or in a\nplace where UVB radiation\nisn't getting to the atmosphere\n12 months out of the year.\nIt's only getting there\nfour months, for example.\nOr even living in our modern day society,\nwhere people just don't\ngo outside anymore.\nI mean, we're inside.\nWe're at our laptops in school.\nWe're at work. We're in\nour cubicle, whatever.\nSo supplementation does play a major role,\nnot only for people with darker skin\nthat aren't outside all\nthe time, but for everyone.\n70% of the US population has\ninadequate vitamin D levels.\n70 of the whole US.\n- [Andrew] Amazing.\n- So this is everyone.\nAnd so I think that insufficient levels\ndefined as less than 30\nnanograms per milliliter,\nand that's defined by\nthe Endocrine Society,\nlooking at a lot of\ndifferent aggregate studies,\nall-cause mortality, for example.\nThere's been a lot of\ndifferent meta analyses\nof all-cause mortality studies,\nwhere vitamin D levels\nreally seem to be ideal\nbetween 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter.\nAnd so, in order to get to that level,\nif you are not outside all the time,\nlive in Southern California,\nwhere you're always outside\nwithout sunscreen on.\nI always wear sunscreen\nbecause I'm trying to protect my skin\nfrom so many wrinkles and stuff,\nbut also skin cancer is\nsomewhat of an issue as well.\nSo, basically, the point is that vitamin D\nis a steroid hormone,\nmeaning it actually binds\nto a receptor and another\nreceptor dimerizes with it,\nthe retinoid receptor,\nand that complex goes into\nthe nucleus of a cell,\nwhere your DNA is,\nand it recognizes little sequences of DNA\ncalled vitamin D response elements.\nThey're called VDREs.\nThey're specific sequences\nof DNA that this complex,\nvitamin D bound with\nthe vitamin D receptor,\ngoes inside and recognizes\nand turns on a whole host of genes,\nturns off a whole host of genes.\nI mean, this is important stuff.\nImagine 70% of the population\nhaving insufficient testosterone, right?\nIt's a steroid hormone.\n- We might be headed\nthere, but probably not.\nNo, I think that names are very important,\nand I think that one of the\nissues is that vitamin D\nis called vitamin D.\nIt's not called DHEA or\nvariant blah, blah, blah.\nIt doesn't sound like a hormone.\nI'm glad that you're mentioning\nskin as the major interface\nbetween the environment\nand vitamin D synthesis\nbecause a lot of people think of skin\nas just a protective sheath around us\nor something to adorn\nourselves with earrings\nor tattoos or whatever,\nbut skin obviously serves those roles,\nbut the skin is an endocrine organ.\nIt has the capacity to make\nthings that impact hormones\nand to make hormones.\nThere's this beautiful\nstudy out this last year.\nThis took place over in Israel,\nwhere they had people get outside\nfor 20 or 30 minutes a\nday, three times a week,\nexposing a culturally acceptable\nyet substantial amount of\ntheir skin during that time,\nand saw big increases in\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nAnd this is through a\nkeratinocyte-linked pathway\ninvolving p53.\nThis was done in humans,\nbut they did some knockout\nstudies in parallel.\nAnd what this study told me or reminded me\nis that skin is an endocrine organ.\nSo the idea that sun could\ntrigger the activation\nof production of a hormone\nis really interesting\nand makes total sense.\nSo, when vitamin D gets into cells,\nand it's binding to these VDR\n- [Rhonda] Es.\n- Es,\nwhat sorts of things are they triggering?\nSo, for testosterone,\nwe know it's going to\ntrigger protein synthesis,\nmuscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera,\nWith estrogen, it's going\nto keep your neurons going,\nyour joints feeling good.\nI always remind people that, by the way,\n'cause guys always seem to want\nto increase their testosterone\nand reduce their estrogen.\nJust remind people, if you\nreduce your estrogen, guys,\nyour libido will plummet to near zero.\nDon't crush your estrogen.\nIt'll also make you stupid.\nIf you're not already stupid,\nit will make you stupid.\nSo estrogen's vitally important\nfor males and females.\nWhen vitamin D gets into cells,\nwhat sorts of things is it stimulating?\n- Okay, so, first of all,\nit's regulating more than 5%\nof the protein-encoded human genome.\nI say more than because, when\nI was looking at this data\nreally in depth starting in 2012 to 2014,\nit was that, and then it's now grown.\nBut one of the important things\nthat you'll find interesting\nthat I published on back in 2014\nwas that I'd gone through\nthis big, published database,\nwhere someone had\npublished all these genes\nthey found VDREs in,\nand basically I found that\ntryptophan hydroxylase-1\nand tryptophan hydroxylase-2 was on there.\nAnd so then I started\nlooking at the sequence,\nand I was doing some in silico work,\nand it turns out that the VDREs\nin tryptophan hydroxylase-2.\nSo, for people listening,\ntryptophan hydroxylase\nis an enzyme that converts\ntryptophan into serotonin.\nSo tryptophan is an amino acid\nthat we get from our food.\nYou convert tryptophan\ninto serotonin in the gut,\nbut you also do it in the brain.\nHowever, serotonin does not\ncross the blood-brain barrier.\nSo tryptophan has to get into your brain,\nand then you have to convert\nit to serotonin in your brain.\nWell, the enzyme that\ndoes that in your brain\nis called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,\nand it's activated by vitamin D.\nThe one in the gut is actually\ntryptophan hydroxylase-1.\nSome of my published work hypothesized\nthat it might actually\nbe repressed by vitamin D\nbecause it has a sequence.\nThe sequence itself, this\n12 nucleotide sequence,\ncan determine, to some degree,\nwhether it's going to be\nactivated or turned off.\nAnd I was able to kind of\nlook at that and think,\noh, maybe this and that.\nSince then, there have been some groups\nthat have confirmed more with in vivo\nand/or in vitro studies.\nMine was all in silico and\nall that stuff, but anyways.\nSo serotonin, a really important one.\nThis is regulating our\nimmune cell, immune system.\nIt's regulating our blood pressure.\nThat's water retention.\nBone, of course, homeostasis.\n5%. More than 5%.\nI can't tell you. Like, so much.\n- And with 70% of the\nUS population deficient,\nI'm beginning to think that\nthis could be the linchpin\non a number of really important issues.\nSo supplementing vitamin\nD3 is what I normally hear.\nI do.\nI think I end up taking 5,000 IUs,\nsometimes 10 IUs of vitamin D3 per day.\nJust done that for a long time,\nand I've had my levels\ntested and they're in range.\nBut I have a family member,\nI'll just mention this.\nI have a family member\nwho was not feeling well,\njust kind of feeling off, a little low,\nhad some digestive issues,\nthis went on a long period of time,\nwas taking, on my\nrecommendation, 15,000 IUs of D3\nand was still deficient in D3.\nNow takes, and I'm not\nsuggesting anyone do this.\nThis is a special case, perhaps,\nbut no chronic illness\nthat we're aware of.\nNeeds to take 30,000 IUs per day\nin order to bring their\nD3 range just into normal,\nwhich, to me, is striking\nbecause they eat quite well,\nthey're a healthy weight, et cetera,\nand it's made a tremendous difference\nin terms of their mood.\nNow, of course, this is correlative.\nNow they feel better. They're doing it.\nWho knows? They're probably\nalso getting outside more.\nBut I think people need to get tested.\nThey need to get their D3 levels tested.\nBut where and what is\na good starting range\nfor people to think\nabout D3 supplementation,\nand, again, foods that can increase D3?\n- So vitamin D3 is a good\nway to supplement with it.\nVitamin D2 would be a plant source.\nYou often find it fortified in foods\nlike milk, usually D2.\n- Does anyone still\ndrink milk besides kids?\n- Out here, it's like\nyou can't find cows milk.\n- [Rhonda] I mean, all the lattes\nthat you're getting.\n- Oat milk, soy milk.\nWhat's the other one?\n- [Rhonda] They're\nfortified in those as well.\n- Oh, they are. Okay.\n- [Rhonda] They are, yeah.\nThey're fortified in-\n- I have a hard time\nfinding cows milk.\n- Almond milk and oat milk\nand all that stuff, yeah.\nThey're in all that stuff.\nVitamin D is naturally to\nsome degree in fatty fish.\nYou think about cod liver oil, right?\nIt has vitamin D,\nbut you're not going\nto correct a deficiency\nwith eating fish for your vitamin D.\nYou're either going to\ncorrect it with sun exposure,\nbeing in the right area,\nhaving the right amount of sun,\nand being the right age,\nbecause, as you get old,\nyou become very inefficient\nat converting vitamin D,\nmaking vitamin D3 in your skin.\n- Well, that's probably\nwhat was going on here\n'cause this person is\ngetting up in their age.\n- There's a lot of single\nnucleotide polymorphisms.\nWe talked about APOE4 before previously,\nbut there's a variety of\ngenes that people have,\nvery common, actually.\nIn fact, I've had many\npeople that have done\nthat exact same thing.\nSo measuring your vitamin D levels\nbefore and after supplementation\nis the only way you're going\nto figure that out, right?\nVery important.\nIf you don't measure it, you don't know.\nYou can't know what you don't measure.\nSo there's a variety of SNPs\nthat basically make that\nconversion inefficient.\nAnd, in fact, there've been a lot\nof these Mendelian randomization studies.\nSo these are studies where scientists\nwill look at commons SNPs,\npeople that have these\ncommon variations of a gene.\nThat's more than 1% of the population.\nSo it's not a random mutation.\nIt's actually found in a sizeable\npercent of the population.\nAnd then, they've looked\nat various outcomes.\nAnd a lot of times, they'll look at genes\nthat are also involved in\nsome kind of lifestyle factor,\nso vitamin D,\nand SNPs that basically\nmake the conversion\nof either vitamin D precursor into D3,\nor D3 into 25-hydroxy vitamin D,\nor into the active steroid hormone,\nwhich is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\nAnd there's a variety of\ndifferent SNPs that show.\nSo you're not looking at\nvitamin D levels at all.\nYou're looking at just the SNPs.\nAnd you know, if they have\nit, they have low vitamin D.\nSo it's really a way of doing\na beautifully randomized controlled trial\nwith an observational study\nbecause you're not biased.\nVitamin D levels are also\nassociated with health.\nPeople that have higher vitamin D\nare either outside more,\nthey're more physically active,\nor they're aware of their health\nand their supplementing, right?\nSo you always have to worry about that\nwhen you're doing an observational study.\nDealing in randomization is\nbeautiful for that reason,\nwhere you're now just random.\nPeople randomly have these genes,\nand there's no health status.\nIf you have the SNP, like your friend,\nlike your family member\nwas healthy and all.\nThey were healthy,\nand yet they couldn't get\ntheir D levels up, right?\nSo these Mendelian\nrandomization studies have found\nthat people that can't\nconvert into the precursor,\nthe 25-hydroxy vitamin D, which\nis usually what's measured.\nIt's the most stable form\nof vitamin D in the body.\nThey have a higher all-cause\nmortality, if they can't do it.\nSo people that don't have it\nhave a lower all-cause mortality.\nThey have a higher\nrespiratory-related mortality.\nThey have a higher\ncancer-related mortality.\nSo, to me... Now, why\ndid I get on this rant?\nOh, because your family member.\nSo, basically, they also are more likely\nto get multiple sclerosis.\nThis has all been done with\nMendelian randomization.\nAnd so it really does\nhammer home the importance\nof measuring your vitamin D levels\nand being very proactive about that.\nI mean, you can get it done anywhere.\nYour doctor will do it. You\nask 'em to do it, you know.\nSo supplementation wise,\ntypically, if you don't\nhave one of those SNPs,\nfor the most part, taking\n1,000 IUs of vitamin D\nwill raise blood levels\nby around five nanograms per milliliter.\nSo let's say you're deficient,\nyou're 20 nanograms per milliliter,\nand you want to get to 40.\nYou're going to need at least 4,000 IUs,\nif you are normal and don't\nhave any of these SNPs\nthat change your metabolism\nof vitamin D, right?\n- Does it matter when you take\nit relative to sun exposure,\ntime of day, with or without food?\n- I've seen some not so\ngreat preliminary evidence\nsuggesting maybe time of day is important.\nI don't think it.\nLike, I can't seem to find\nanything that really suggests.\nBecause for it to actually be\nconverted into the hormone,\nI mean, it's stored.\n- It's slow-acting.\nThese steroid hormones are slow-acting.\n- Yeah, it's not like immediate thing.\nSo maybe we'll get some new\ndata that's like otherwise,\nbut I just don't, yeah.\n- It simplifies the problem anyway.\nSo, for people who are\ngoing to be stubborn\nand not get their D3 levels\ntested or their D levels tested,\nand simply say, \"Oh,\nI'll just take some D3.\"\nThat was me, by the\nway, until I got tested.\nI threw 5,000 IUs into\nthe mix and figured,\nwell, it's not going to kill me.\nIt'll bring my vitamin D levels up.\nI realize that's a bit of a\ncoarse way to approach it,\nbut I feel fine, and I'm still\nbreathing and ambulatory.\nSo, is that reasonable?\n1,000 to 5,000 IUs for most\npeople will be reasonably safe.\nAgain, just assuming that people\nare going to just jump to it\nwithout the blood test.\n- Of course, I think that,\nif we look at the literature,\nthe scientific literature,\nit is extremely hard to get hypercalcemia,\nwhich would be the major concern\nwith really high levels of\nvitamin D3 supplementation.\nI mean, we're talking\nlike hundreds of thousands\nof IU a day for a long time.\n- Hundreds of thousands.\n- Yes, yes.\nNow, the upper tolerable intake was set\nby the Medicine Institute to be 4,000.\nIt was kind of like one of\nthose things where it's safe.\nI personally take 5,000 IUs a day as well,\nand my levels really hover\naround 50 nanograms per mill.\nI don't put sunscreen on all the time.\nI do put it on my face and I wear a hat,\nbut some of my skin is being exposed,\nso I do make it from the sun as well.\n- I'm glad you brought up the fact\nthat you keep arms exposed.\nBecause, in these studies\nthat I mentioned before,\nlooking at sun exposure on skin\nand increases in other hormones,\ntestosterone, estrogen, mainly,\nit became clear from looking at those data\nthat the amount of skin that\nyou expose is important,\nwhich makes perfect\nsense once you hear that,\nbut I think most people are thinking,\noh, I'm out in the sun,\nbut are you wearing shorts and a t-shirt,\nor are you wearing a\nsweatshirt and it's a hoodie?\nAre you all covered up out in the sun?\nWell, that might be great for\nsetting your circadian rhythm\nby way of light through the eyes\n'cause that's the primary\nmechanism for that.\nBut seems to me that the\nmore of your body surface\nthat you can safely and appropriately,\nplease, folks,\nappropriately expose to the sun,\nthe more vitamin D you're going to create.\nSo laying out on your back\ndeck in shorts and a t-shirt\nwith arms exposed and legs exposed\nis a very different stimulus\nthan walking around in\njeans and a sweatshirt.\n- Absolutely.\n- Right? Okay, okay.\nEspecially if you have\nsunscreen on your face.\nI know it almost seems\nlike trivially simple,\nbut I'm not sure that\npeople are used to thinking\nabout their skin as a interface\nto create these hormones.\n- Yeah.\n- So surface area matters.\n- And by the way, there have\nbeen studies looking at people\nthat are deficient in vitamin D.\nIn this case, it was African Americans\nthat were given a 4,000 IU\na day vitamin D supplement\nto bring them back to sufficient levels.\nThis was a smaller\nstudy than I would like,\nbut it reversed their\nepigenetic aging by three years.\nBecause, again, it's a hormone.\nIt's regulating more than 5%\nof your protein-encoding human genome.\nThere's been studies looking\nat vitamin D receptor knockout mice.\nAnd I use this a lot in my presentations\nwhen I'm talking about\nvitamin D and longevity.\nIf you look at these animals,\nthe vitamin D receptor,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nvitamin D binds to the receptor,\nand then it complexes with\nthe retinoid receptor,\nand they go into the nucleus as a complex\nand turn on and turn off genes.\nWell, if you get rid of that receptor,\nwhich is what you can\ndo in animal studies,\nyou can determine what\neffects there will be\nwith no vitamin D.\nLike, how do you study no vitamin D?\nAnd so what was found\nwas that these animals,\nand, in fact, I don't think\nit was a complete knockout\n'cause I think it might\nbe embryonic lethal, but-\n- [Andrew] Some hypomorph.\n- Yes.\n- Which is basically geek speak for a gene\nis vastly reduced in its\nfunction, number and function,\nnumber, people know what I mean,\nbut isn't eliminated completely.\n- Right, well, these animals,\nif you look at them after\nthe age of four months,\nI mean, the mice look like.\nI mean, they're accelerated aging.\nThey're wrinkled. They have no hair.\nTheir lifespan's shorter.\nI mean, you can look at this animal\nand not know anything about\nmice or work with them\nand be like, \"That animal\nlooks like it's...\"\nOf course, mice lifespans\nare only like two,\ntwo and a half years,\nbut, like, 500 years old.\n- Looks like it went to\ngraduate school twice.\n- [Rhonda] Yeah.\n- Actually, graduate\nschool's a lot of fun.\nI like to think I aged\nbackwards in graduate school,\nwhich is not true.\nI look at the photos. I\ndefinitely aged forward.\nYou, on the other hand,\nlook exactly the same\nway you did 10 years ago.\nI'm not saying that to flatter you,\nbut it's absolutely true.\nI mean, the data or the\ndata. It's remarkable.\nSo I'm definitely going to try\nand get my omega-3 percentage up there.\nI'm not going to hinge it all on that,\nbut clearly you're doing\na lot of things right.\nSo, if I'm taking vitamin D3,\nI still need to get out into the sun.\nCorrect?\n- Absolutely.\n- Okay, I think a lot of\npeople don't know that,\nor, at least, I have family members\nthat have been a little bit resistant.\nLike, \"I take my vitamin D\n\"so I don't need to get outside as much.\"\nI think people are really afraid\nof getting out into the sun\nbecause they're worried about melanomas.\nAnd, to be honest, I'm\nas scared of sunscreen\nas I am of melanoma.\nSome of the things in\nsunscreen are really spooky,\nmainly the compound.\nAnd here, I'm not one of these conspiracy.\nI drink tap water. Listen, folks.\nPeople cringe, but I drink tap water.\nI have the occasional croissant or donut.\n90%, 80% of the time,\nI'm doing the right things,\nthe right way, I think.\nAlthough, I'm now going to improve on them\nwith this new knowledge.\nBut I don't like what I\nsee in most sunscreens.\nBecause, if you look at these compounds,\nthey cross the blood-brain barrier.\nI don't want compounds crossing\nthe blood-brain barrier.\n- Titanium dioxide?\n- Dioxide, some of the triclosans\nthat are also in these cleansers.\nI mean, once you know a\nlittle bit about neurons,\nfolks, you realize the neurons you got\nare basically the ones you've\ngot for your entire life.\nThere's a reason why there's\na blood-brain barrier,\na blood-ovary, and a blood-testes barrier.\nIt's because the genetic material resides\nin the testes, the ovaries, and the brain.\nThose neurons don't turn over.\nThere are a few new neurons\nbut not that many unless\nyou're a mouse, frankly.\nAnd so protecting those is very key,\nand a lot of the things in sunscreen\nare downright dangerous.\nSo I think there are\nsunscreens that are safe,\nbut it's very hard to figure out\nwhich sunscreens are\nfree of these compounds.\nI'm amazed that they're\nstill on the market, frankly.\n- I've always geared towards\nthe ones with the minerals\nthat are reflecting it.\nIt is somewhat difficult\nto penetrate things\nall the way through the skin\nand get into the bloodstream,\nbut I don't know.\nMaybe some of these compounds\nget in there easily.\nI have seen the evidence\nwith some of those things.\n- Yeah, there is some\nevidence they go transdermal.\n- And they get in.\nOkay, well, I know that some\nof them react with the sun\nand, while they do protect\nfrom the UVA and/or B,\nthey form massive reactive\noxygen species and carcinogen.\nI mean, it's like the\nvery thing you're trying\nto protect yourself from\nmight actually cause-\n- [Andrew] Right.\n- We don't know. It's\ncompletely speculation.\nThere is, I think, some more\nand more evidence coming out\nwith some of those compounds.\nI can't remember all of\n'em off the top of my head,\nbut a lot of high-end ones also have.\nIt's the chemical sunscreen ones.\n- Right, right.\n- [Rhonda] The chemical ones.\n- I'm proposing that we do a journal club.\nA journal club, folks, is\nwhere academics get together.\nWell, they read papers,\nthen they get together,\nand they pick apart the papers.\nThere's a strong correlation\nbetween being an early graduate student\nand being the most critical.\n'Cause once you've actually\npublished some papers,\nyou realize that, most studies,\npeople are doing their best\nwithin the context of what they can do.\nBut it'd be great to do a journal club\nat some point about sunscreens\n'cause I'd love to really figure out\nwhat's in these compounds.\nPeople are using them like crazy.\nAnd I'm not one of\nthese people who's like,\noh, I won't use commercial toothpaste\nor anything like that.\nLike I said, I drink tap water.\nI use commercial toothpaste, whatever.\nBut when it comes to\nsunscreen, it freaks me out\nbecause some of these\ncompounds do go transdermal\nand some of them cross\nthe blood-brain barrier,\nand I'd like to keep my\nneurons free of that stuff.\nAnyway, we're speculating now.\n- Wear a hat.\n- Wear a hat,\nbut get out in the sun\nand get your D3 levels up.\nOkay, so, we talked about\nthese plant-based compounds,\nthe omega-3s, and D3.\nUnless there's something else\nthat you just absolutely\nmust throw into the mix,\nI probably will return\nus to the conversation\nthat I opened up with, which\nwas about cold and heat,\nwhich, admittedly, I\npulled us off that path,\nso I take full responsibility for that.\nBut before I do that,\nI just want to offer you the opportunity.\nIs there anything to supplement-based\nor food-based compounds that\nyou think are especially useful\nfor brain and/or body health?\n- I do think magnesium is\nimportant in there as well.\nI mean, I think, again, about\n40% of the US population\ndoesn't get enough magnesium.\nIt's an essential mineral\nwe're supposed to be\ngetting from our diet.\n- Involved in everything.\n- It is. It's also involved\nin vitamin D metabolism.\nAnd, in fact, being deficient in magnesium\nmay make it more difficult\nfor you to actually\nmake vitamin D hormone,\nso that 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D.\nSo one of those other factors, again,\nwe talked about genetics,\nbut there's also magnesium status as well.\nConsidering 40%, that's a big number.\nNow, magnesium's also\ninvolved in making ATP,\nthe energetic currency of our cells.\nBasically, all of our cells\nneed ATP to do anything.\nIt's also involved in utilizing ATP\nas well as DNA repair enzymes.\nThese are enzymes that are involved\nin repairing damage to our DNA.\nI personally think that\nmagnesium insufficiency\ncauses an insidious type of damage daily\nthat you can't look in the mirror and see.\nWhen you're deficient in vitamin C,\nyou're like, \"My gums are falling apart.\n\"I have scurvy, right?\"\nBut you can't see DNA damage.\nYou can't see it, but it's happening.\nIt's happening right now in my body,\nand it's happening in your body.\nIt's happening. Normal metabolism\nis happening every day.\nBut we repair that damage.\nWe have repair enzymes in our body\ncalled DNA repair enzymes.\nThey require magnesium.\nMagnesium is a co-factor for them.\nWhat that means, a co-factor means,\nenzymes need it to function properly,\nand so, without that co-factor,\nthey're not doing it properly.\nThe way I like to think\nabout magnesium. It's easy.\n'Cause people go, \"What\nfood should I eat?\"\nNaturally, that's the next question.\nWell, magnesium is at the center\nof a chlorophyll molecule.\nChlorophyll is what gives\nplants their green color.\nSo dark, leafy greens\nare high in magnesium.\nBasically, what does the 40%\ninsufficiency in the US tell us?\nPeople aren't eating their greens.\nThey're not eating their greens.\nThey're eating their packaged food.\nThey're eating their processed food.\nThe standard American\ndiet isn't really high\nin dark, leafy greens.\nSo dark, leafy greens are how\nI like to get my magnesium.\nI think it comes along with\nall these other important.\nI mean, you get calcium in\nthem. You get vitamin K1.\nYou're getting a lot of\nother micronutrients,\nand you're getting other compounds\nthat we don't know about,\nand ones that we know about,\nlike sulforaphane, right?\n- As with broccoli,\ndo I need to eat the\ndark, leafy greens raw?\nAnd, in this case, I'm\na little more open to it\nbecause I actually like the\ntaste of, dare I say, kale.\nAnd kale's a dark, leafy green, right?\n- Yes, and it's high in\nlutein and zeaxanthin as well.\n- I'm a trichromat, meaning\nI'm not color blind,\nbut I just want to make sure it falls\nunder the strict category.\n'Cause every once in a while, I'm like,\n\"Oh, I eat my vegetables.\"\nI like avocados,\nand people remind me\navocados are not a vegetable.\nI love vegetables also.\nSo kale, what are some other examples?\n- Kale, spinach, chard, like\nSwiss chard, rainbow chard,\nromaine lettuce.\n- Is the bitterness an\nimportant component to this?\n- For magnesium, no, but for sulforaphane,\nfor cruciferous vegetables.\nThat would be the brassica family.\nBut your question about cooking them.\nSo magnesium, it is\nbound to the food matrix,\nand it can be somewhat less bioavailable.\nSo cooking it can somewhat\nrelease the magnesium,\nbut it goes into the water too.\nSo you have to either steam it\nor kind of like get your water in.\n- You can drink the water.\n- Yeah, I personally don't worry about it.\n- Okay, great.\n- [Rhonda] I just don't worry.\n- Well, if you don't worry,\nI'm not going to worry.\n- But I also do supplement with magnesium.\nSo supplementation with magnesium,\nI mean, we could go on and on.\nLet's keep this short and sweet\nbecause we're going to get\nback to the other stuff.\nBut it can cause GI\ndistress at high doses.\nI personally like to take\naround 130 or 135 milligrams.\nThat way, it's not like\na huge bolus to my gut.\n- But I think it depends on\nthe form of magnesium too.\n- Yes, yeah.\nI mean, you can take magnesium\nthreonate, for example,\nand it doesn't affect the gut as much.\n- Magnesium citrate.\n- Citrate is what I take.\n- [Rhonda] I take Thorne.\n- It's a pretty potent\ngut stimulus.\nI feel like it's a little\nbit harder to digest.\n- 135 milligrams should be pretty good.\nAnd citrate, actually,\noh boy, do we want to go here?\n- I mean, it's up to\nyou. We don't have to.\nPersonally, I've been\nsupplementing with magnesium\nfor a long time.\nI use threonate and bisglycinate\nand malate for different reasons.\nSo, yes, I would love to\ngo there if you're willing.\n- I would say malate would be the best,\nand that has to do with\nthe short-chain fatty acids\nbeing good for the gut\nand a lot of work done\nby a former colleague\nof mine and good friend,\nMark Shigenaga, showing that\nthe short-chain fatty acid,\ncitrate, malate, lactate,\nbut specifically malate,\nreally, and lactate\nare the major ones that get\ninto the gut epithelial cells\nand are an energy source\nfor the mitochondria\nand the goblet cells, so anyways,\nwhole other topic.\n- That's okay.\nI take malate because I was\ntold that it would be helpful.\nFirst of all, it doesn't make me sleepy\nlike some of the other forms of magnesium,\nwhich act as a mild sedative for me.\nThey do tap into the GABAergic pathway,\na neurotransmitter, folks,\nthat, in general, broad\nsweeping generalization here,\ncan have somewhat of a sedative quality,\nwhich is why I take magnesium threonate\nand/or bisglycinate before sleep,\n30 to 60 minutes before sleep.\nDefinitely enhances my\ntransition time to sleep\nand the depth of sleep.\nNo question, in my experience.\nThere's some data that threonate\ncan be neuroprotective,\nalthough those studies are still ongoing.\nI'm getting the sense that maybe you're\na little more skeptical of that than I am.\n- Yeah, no, I've seen the\nstudies with the threonate.\nI think, looking at the actual data\nfrom the one clinical study,\nthere wasn't statistical significance\nuntil all three of the pieces\nof data were pulled together,\nbut that really could just\nbe because their sample size\nwas too small, right?\n- Yeah, I'm thinking that paired with the,\nthere's some work-\n- [Rhonda] The animal stuff.\n- Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on.\nThis is getting kind of\ninside ball of neuroscience.\nThe quality of the labs matters, folks,\nand that's something that's not accessible\nto people outside of fields.\nGuosong Liu and some of the\nother folks at that time at MIT,\nI think very highly of their work.\nAnd so the animal studies are\nindeed just animal studies,\nbut I was pretty impressed\nby what they did in those studies.\nVery pioneering when you\nthink about this being done\n10, 12, 15 years ago.\nAnd then, yes, we need\nmore human clinical data.\nBut, for me, I figured that,\ngiven the safety profile\nof mag threonate, given that\nit helps me sleep better,\nand sleeping better is just\nbetter for everything, frankly.\nThat's why I take it.\nAnd bisglycinate and threonate\nseem to be somewhat interchangeable,\nbut I don't know of any reports\nthat bisglycinate can be neuroprotective.\nBut malate I take during the daytime.\nFor me, and, again, this is subjective,\nit has a tangible effect\nin improving the recovery\ntime from exercise.\nI don't know that I've\nbeen sore from a workout\nsince I started taking malate,\nand I used to get very sore\nfrom even kind of trivial workouts.\nSo I don't know what's going\non there, but I keep taking it.\n- Malate, again, the\nshort-chain fatty acid,\nand when you do intense exercise,\nyou release endotoxin from your gut.\nI'm just going back to\nthe interesting work\n'cause the malate being\nthe short-chain fatty acid\nand Mark Shigenaga showing,\nthis is all an animal research by the way,\nbut it was feeding these animals malate.\nIt really protected the\ngut, endotoxin release,\nand it affected metabolic\nsyndrome and all sorts of things.\nBut I think malates awesome,\nand I always try to eat green apples.\nThey're really high in malic acid.\n- [Andrew] Oh, good to know.\n- And tart cherries.\nTart cherries are really\nhigh in it as well.\n- They also taste really good.\n- But I was really interested\nin the magnesium threonate stuff.\nI take a supplement called\nMagnesi-Om by Moon Juice.\nAnd it's like a little powder.\nIt's got a little bit of monk\nfruit, but it tastes good.\nSo I do it a little bit\nbefore bedtime as well.\nProbably several more hours though\nbecause I don't like to\ndrink tons and tons of fluids\nbefore I go to bed.\nAnd it has magnesium threonate,\nand a variety of other versions\nof magnesium in it as well,\nand I really like it.\nBut I thought the\nmagnesium threonate stuff\nwas super interesting.\nI would love to see more\nclinical data as well,\nbut I think, once we get\nit, it'll probably be like,\noh yeah, it's getting into\nthe brain, and it's awesome,\nso, you know, why wait?\n- And along those lines,\nI once put out a post that said,\nI feel like there are a\nnumber of different categories\nof health information consumers online\nand understanding which one\nyou're in for which topic\ncan alleviate a lot of\nthe strain and stress\nof finding the information.\nThere's some people that\nare perfectly comfortable\nwith data from a mouse study.\nIt's like, \"If it's done in\nmice, great. I'll try it.\"\nOther people say, \"No, it\nhas to be done in humans.\"\nDouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.\nRandomized clinical trials, et cetera.\nThen, other people just\nsay, \"You know what?\n\"I don't even care about any of that.\n\"Just tell me what you do.\"\nAnd then, other people\nsay, \"You know what?\n\"I don't even care what you\ndo. Just tell me what to do.\"\nAnd then, there's this other category\nwhich are, if it's in\npill form or powder form,\nthey'll take it.\nAnd so I think a lot of the battles\nof people picking apart\npeople's posts and things\nhave to do with the fact\nthat people don't realize\nthat people are showing up to the table\nin one or some combination\nof those stances.\nWe know people that will try anything,\nand we know people that\nwon't take anything.\nSo the idea here is to create\nan array of possibilities\nfor people, and I think the\nanimal data are very impressive.\nWe should have you back on to talk-\n- I take it with the hope of,\nbecause I feel like the animal data\nis very promising.\n- Right, there you go.\n- And so I'm like, it\nprobably is, so why not?\n- Well, and obviously\nyou're doing things right.\nSo cold and heat\nconverge on some common pathways\nrelated to what you called\nintermittent challenge,\nwhich I love.\nI think, intermittent\nfasting, cold, heat, exercise,\nI mean, maybe even\nintermittent sleep deprivation.\nI keep waiting for the intermittent\nsleep deprivation movement.\nI will say, I pull a few\nall-nighters per year\njust for work demands and\nprocrastination and deadlines.\nI'm the worst combination of academic\n'cause I'm both a procrastinator\nand a perfectionist,\nso you end up pulling some all-nighters.\nThe sleep I get the next\nnight is pretty amazing.\nI must say, it's the sleep of gods,\nbut I don't recommend anyone\nuse sleep deprivation for that.\nBut I could imagine that we also evolved\nhaving some sleepless nights.\nSo this idea of intermittent challenge\nis a really attractive one,\nand I want to make sure that we credit you\nwith the phrase intermittent challenge.\n- No, credit Dr. Mark Mattson.\n- Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit.\n- Who's published,\nand he has used that-\n- He used those words.\n- Oh, that phrase.\n- Yes.\n- Okay, great. We'll make sure.\n- Just like Dr. David Sinclair,\nI love the xenohormesis.\nIt was in one of his\npublications so many years ago,\nand I just love it.\nBrilliant. A brilliant term.\nSo Mark Mattson gets credit.\n- Those Harvard guys\nare pretty smart.\nI mean, it's a good school, I guess.\nOf course it's a good school.\nWe will credit the appropriate people.\nThank you for that clarification.\nSo you've talked a lot about the use\nof what I call deliberate cold exposure,\nonly to distinguish it from cold\nthat you might just be\naccidentally exposed to,\nbut it's sort of obvious\nwhen we say cold exposure.\nThere are some amazing data on cold.\nThe other day I saw a post from you,\nand you've included this in talks before.\nI did not know this until\nI learned it from you,\nso credit to you,\nthat even 20 seconds of immersion in,\nI think, it was four degree.\n- 49 degree Fahrenheit.\n- 49 degree Fahrenheit.\nOkay, I was translating to Celsius,\nbut 49 degree Fahrenheit\nwater, so cold water,\ncan lead to long-lasting increases\nin epinephrine, adrenaline,\nand I have to presume\nother neuromodulators\nand neurochemicals as well.\nWhat are some cold protocols\nthat you find particularly\ninteresting or attractive\nfrom the standpoint of, I\ndunno, pick your favorite,\nmetabolism, neuro/mood effects,\nbrown fat stimulation,\nwhich, of course, weaves\nback to metabolism.\nWe could do an entire\nepisode all about cold,\nbut what I'd love to know is,\nwhat sort of activity\nor stimulus do you think\nis a reasonable and\nparticularly potent one\nto use in terms of cold?\n- So, today, I did three minutes\nat 49 degrees Fahrenheit.\nI have a cold tub.\n- So you get in up to your neck?\n- Well, I try. I keep floating up.\nIt's like really hard.\nI would say maybe most of my shoulder.\nI mean, really I'm floating up.\nI was telling my husband.\nI was like, \"There's too\nmuch water in here for me.\"\n- Or too much salt in there?\nIs it like the Dead Sea\nwhere you float on top?\n- Is there salt in there? I don't know.\nHe takes care of all the\nstuff that, you know.\nIt's the Plunge.\n- By the way, the podcast\nnor I am sponsored by Plunge.\nThey did give me one.\nThat thing is fantastic.\nAlso, 'cause it circulates the water.\n- It does.\n- Which makes sure that you\nbreak up the thermal layer,\nand it's even colder.\n- It is even colder. It sucks!\nAnyways, so look,\nI'll be honest here.\nI wish I did more cold than I do.\nI do cold when I'm going\nto go on a podcast.\nI definitely do cold when\nI'm going to do a podcast,\nwhen I'm going to give a\ntalk or when I'm anxious.\nI need to make it more of a ritual.\nI love doing the sauna. I hate the cold.\nI hate it, unless it's summertime.\nIt's a lot easier for\nme to get in the cold\nin the summertime.\nBut what I do love about the\ncold is how I feel after.\nAnd I feel less anxious.\nI feel good.\nI feel more focused, which\nis why I'll usually do it\nbefore any type of public speaking,\nor when I'm just anxious,\nI'll just get in there.\nAnd so the 20 seconds at 49 degrees,\nI think it was 49 degrees Fahrenheit\nwas really a good number\nbecause time and temperature,\ntime, or duration, I guess,\nwould be a better word,\nand temperature do matter,\nbut you can do 20 seconds\nat a colder temperature,\nwhich is I prefer,\nor you can do a minute or\nlonger at a warmer temperature.\nI think there was another study\nshowing 59 degrees Fahrenheit at one hour\nwas like two to three, but\nwho wants to do one hour\nat 59?\n- Yeah, I'm familiar\nwith that study.\nSo this really reveals just\nhow absolutely nerdy I am\nand maybe why some times and relationships\nin my life were challenged.\nI love reading the method\nsections of papers.\nSo people can come at me\nwith a number of things\nabout papers, and I might miss something.\nSurely I miss certain\nthings, like anybody does,\nbut the methods I relish\nin reading the methods,\nand that paper is really interesting\n'cause they had people sit\nin lawn chairs basically\nin swimming pools for an hour.\nIt was chilly. It wasn't super cold.\nI mean 60 is not.\nIt's not warm, but it's\nnot ice-cold obviously.\nBut an hour is ridiculous at some level.\nBut the increases in dopamine\nwere massive and lasted hours.\nSo the mood enhancing\neffects that you report,\nyou're not imagining that.\nThose are almost certainly a consequence\nof having slowly elevating\nbut significantly elevated\ndopamine that goes on for hours.\nThat's almost a dreamlike\nprofile for dopamine.\nBecause most everything else,\nlike an Adderall or Ritalin,\na cup of coffee and a\npre-workout drink or something,\nis going to give you a big\nspike in adrenaline and dopamine\nand a big crash.\nAnd somehow, it creates this\nreally nice, contoured profile.\nSo whatever you're experiencing there\nis very nicely supported by the data.\n- Well, I need to get doing it more.\nI've had a couple of scary experiences\ngoing from hot to cold.\n- Can you explain?\n- Blood pressure changes, I think,\nwhere I basically went straight\nfrom a really hot jacuzzi.\nI was in there for like 30 minutes.\nI was doing heat stress.\n- Jacuzzi, okay.\n- Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- [Andrew] That's toasty.\n- For 30 minutes, and\nthen I went straight into,\nat the time, it was our pool,\nit was in February, it was\nwintertime, and it was 50.\nIt was in the 50s. It was cold.\nAnd I was in there,\nand I was listening to\nSimon and Garfunkel,\nI was trying to stay in a\nlong time, get on my cold,\nand I was trying to impress Dan\n'cause he'll stay in\nthere for like 15 minutes.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- But I started to feel really blinkey,\nlike low blood pressure or something,\nand I got scared, so I got out,\nand then I couldn't stand, like\nI had vertigo or something,\nand I was so scared.\nI was so scared.\nAnd I've had a couple of times too\nwhere just going straight\nfrom the sauna to it,\nto the Cold Plunge, where I'm\nstarting to feel, I'm like,\nooh, I feel a little blood\npressure change or something.\nIt makes sense.\nThe sauna is causing\nvasodilation and the Cold Plunge\nor cold exposure is\ncausing vasoconstriction,\nso it's like a very\njust shock to my system.\nAnd so, now, I wait.\nI wait like a few minutes before going in.\nBut I do need to kind of like\nmake the cold more routine.\nBecause I talk all about the science.\nI'm familiar with all the science,\nand the norepinephrine or noradrenaline,\nit's affecting brain and mood.\nYou know way more about that than I do.\nI know how I feel,\nand I know it's a neurotransmitter,\nand it is released, at least,\nin rats, they've shown.\nOr was it mice? I think\nit might've been rats.\nBut multiple studies\nshowing that it's released\nfrom the cold in the brain.\n- And now, in humans as well.\n- Oh, in the brain, they've shown.\n- So, in that study, we\ncould put a link to this,\nit's published in 2000 in\nEuropean Journal of Physiology,\nthat big dopamine increase.\nThey also looked at\nepinephrine and cortisol\nand saw some really.\nYeah, so this has been done.\n- They did brain. Oh-\n- [Andrew] Oh, no, no-\n- The plasma, yeah.\nYes, plasma.\n- Very hard to measure\ndopamine directly from the brain\nunless you're doing microdialysis.\nNo, unfortunately,\nunfortunately, their skulls were intact.\nFortunately, for them,\nunfortunately, for the research community,\ntheir skulls were intact,\nso they couldn't measure\ndirectly in the brain.\nBut obviously, there's a correlate there.\nIt's a very real effect.\nBut the advantage of\nnot doing it too often\nis that you're not cold adapted.\nNow, it's very hard for anyone\nto get truly cold adapted.\nSome people start to\nlook forward to the cold.\nAnd what I think they're\nlooking forward to\nis the feeling afterward,\nthat dopamine rush.\nBut, if you get cold adapted,\nthen it certainly blunts\nsome of the effect.\n- But I want to be cold adapted\nbecause that means I\nhave more mitochondria\nin my adipose tissue\nand perhaps even muscle.\nThat's been shown.\n- So maybe there's a good opportunity to,\nso cold and UCP1, if you\ncould educate us on UCP1.\nI find this really interesting,\nand I learned about it from you.\n- Yeah, well, so norepinephrine\nactually released in the plasma.\nIt does act as a hormone.\nVasoconstriction is one thing it does,\nbut it also regulates a\nvariety of molecular functions\nthat have to do with adaption to cold,\none happening to be,\nshivering is a very inefficient\nway to produce heat,\nwhich is what your body's trying to do\nwhen it's exposed to cold,\nand your muscles are basically contracting\nand producing heat from that,\nbut that's just not very efficient.\nSo the more eloquent way to do it,\nor elegant, I guess, way to do it\nis to basically have your mitochondria\nproduce tons and tons of heat.\nSo the way it does this\nis by activating a gene\ncalled UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.\nNorepinephrine is upstream\nof that, activating it.\nWhat that does is, essentially,\nso mitochondria are\nthese little organelles\ninside of your cells\nthat are responsible for producing energy.\nUsually, that's in the form of\nadenosine triphosphate, ATP,\nand that's what lets everything function\ninside of your body,\nfrom your neurotransmitter production\nto your heart beating, et cetera.\nHowever, you can uncouple\nyour mitochondria.\nBasically, your mitochondria,\nthey're like a little\nbattery, so they have,\nwell, they have a double membrane,\nfirst of all, their structure,\nbut they have a negative\ncharge on the inside,\nand they have a positive\ncharge on the inner membrane,\nso in between the outer\nmembrane and the inside part.\n- Like a neuron.\n- Like a neuron, yeah.\n- [Andrew] Yeah, cool.\n- So I guess,\nit's like a neuron.\nIt's like a battery,\nnegative and positive.\nWell, basically, you can\nuncouple that charge,\nand so that positive charge proton\nstart leaking out of the mitochondria,\nand your mitochondria freak out.\nSo this is called uncoupling it.\nIt's maximum respiration, as we call it.\nThey try to make as much energy.\nThey're like, \"I got to\nget that proton back,\n\"that gradient, electrochemical gradient.\"\nAnd so they just go insane.\nIn this case, it's uncoupled energy,\nso the energy they're making\nis actually heat, not ATP,\nbut you're essentially burning\nsubstrate, so who cares?\nYou're burning glucose.\nYou're burning lipids.\nYou're basically burning\nthings and making heat.\nAnd so that's what uncoupling does,\nand that is a much more efficient way\nof producing heat than shivering.\nSo, as you become more adapted,\nmaybe the longer duration\nthat you've stayed in the cold\nor the more times you've done it,\nyou'll no longer shiver anymore.\nYou will start to then just\ndo this uncoupling type\nof thermogenesis, as it's called.\nAnd another type of adaptation that occurs\nis you actually produce more mitochondria\nin your adipose tissue.\nAnd that actually happens,\nalso regulated by\nnorepinephrine or noradrenaline,\nthrough a protein called PGC-1alpha.\nAnd what that protein does\nis it makes more mitochondria\nin your adipose cell.\nSo, per adipose cell, you're\ngetting more mitochondria.\nIt's a beautiful way to\nbasically make more heat.\nIt's one of those things where it's like,\nyour body's going, \"Okay,\nI'm going to be exposed\n\"to this cold next time.\n\"How can I make sure I don't die?\n\"Oh, I can have more mitochondria,\n\"and I'm going to make more heat.\"\nAnd so you're making more mitochondria\nin your adipose tissue.\nAnd this is often referred\nto as the browning of fat.\nAnd the reason for that is because,\nif you look under a\nmicroscope at a lipid droplet,\nbasically, a fat cell,\nnot a lipid droplet, adipocyte,\nyou'll find that it looks darker\nbecause there's more\nmitochondria in there.\nSo it's referred to as browning fat.\nI don't want to get into\nthe whole beige fat, brown.\nYou know, there's this whole,\nI'm sure you've had experts\non that talk all about that.\n- No, not yet.\nI always think of white\nfat, beige fat, brown fat.\nAnd beige is kind of,\nwhite can be converted into beige.\n- Right, and beige can take on\nthermogenic characteristics essentially,\nand so you can activate beige\nfat so that it's thermogenic\nin the sense that it's burning\nglucose and/or fatty acids\nand producing heat.\nSo the more you expose yourself to cold,\nthe more you can brown\nyour fat, so to speak,\nand therefore you can tolerate\nthe cold for longer periods,\nwhich people do notice,\nand you can then have\nthe thermogenic qualities\nof having more brown adipose tissue\nor beige, activated beige, adipose tissue.\nYou'll get a lot of\nnaysayers out there saying,\n\"Oh, brown fat doesn't\nregulate metabolism at all.\"\nAnd the reality is there's\nthousands of researchers\ntrying to pill up brown\nfat and thermogenic.\nThey're trying to make it a pill\nbecause it does affect metabolism.\nIt's not the only thing.\nIt's certainly, if you're obese\nand trying to lose weight,\nyou're not going to do that\njust by doing cold exposure.\nYou need to do dietary and\nexercise changes predominantly,\nbut it does affect metabolism.\nAnd this has been shown in human studies,\nso it is an interesting,\nit's another possible mechanism\nfor affecting metabolism,\nand that's an adipose tissue,\nbut you also make more\nmitochondria and muscle tissue.\nAnd this is regulated,\nnot via norepinephrine,\nbut it is still PGC-1alpha, interestingly,\nnot that anyone else really cares but me,\nand maybe you do, Andrew.\n- I'm eating this up.\n- So PGC-1alpha responds to norepinephrine\nin adipose tissue to\nmake more mitochondria,\nbut, in muscle tissue, it's\nunclear what the regulator is.\nCold exposure does it.\nSo this was shown at least in\na couple of studies I've seen,\nwhere people that were\nexercising, I believe,\nor maybe it may have been men\nonly that were exercising,\ndid some training, and then\ndid cold water immersion,\nsomething like 50 degrees\nFahrenheit, 15 minutes,\nand PGC-1alpha, which is a biomarker\nfor mitochondrial biogenesis,\nwhich is the generation\nof new mitochondria.\nBy the way, that's awesome.\nYou want more mitochondria in your muscle.\nIt's associated with improved muscle mass,\nimproved endurance.\nMitochondria are essentially,\nthey're making energy in your cell.\nWe don't make more mitochondria normally.\nYou have certain inputs,\nhigh-intensity interval\ntraining, exercise can do it.\n- Can actually make more mitochondria.\n- Yes, yeah, and that's\nbeen shown in people.\n- Weight training or just\nhigh-intensity interval training?\n- I haven't seen weight training.\nI've seen it in high-intensity\ninterval training,\nendurance training,\nbut that doesn't mean\nthat it hasn't been shown,\nI just haven't seen it, or\nthat it hasn't been looked at.\n- That's good to know.\nI'm always looking for reasons\nto finally do more HIT type,\nhigh-intensity interval training work.\nI do weight training, and\nI do low-intensity cardio.\n- There was a brilliant study by,\nat the time, he was a\npostdoc, Matthew Robinson,\nand he's now gone on to start his own lab\nat the University of Oregon\nHealth Science Center.\n- [Andrew] Great place, yeah.\n- And he did a study where\nboth young and older people,\nthey had this whole\nhigh-intensity protocol,\nwhich I can't remember what it was,\nbut their protocol for X amount of time.\nI'm sure it was at least a month.\nThey then measured biomarkers\nof mitochondrial biogenesis\nin their muscle tissue,\nand the amount of mitochondrial biogenesis\nin old people specifically,\nit happened in both\nyoung and old from HIT,\nfrom the high-intensity interval training,\nwas, I mean, it was enormous,\nat least 50%, I think.\n- [Andrew] Fantastic.\n- So it was just like, whoa!\nAnd so, why would you want that?\nWell, mitochondria,\nyour cells are turning over.\nYou make new cells. You replace old ones.\nWith your mitochondria,\nyou don't really do\nthat for the most part.\nYou can.\nMitochondrial biogenesis does happen,\nbut you have to stimulate it to happen.\nAnd what happens with your mitochondria\nis they essentially are bobbing\naround inside of your cells,\nand then they fuse with\nother mitochondria,\nexchange all their\ncontent, mitochondrial DNA,\nand then fizz back apart.\nAnd that's how they\nkind of stay young-ish.\nBut, as you age, you keep doing that\nwith the same pool of mitochondria,\nthen you're going to get a\nbunch of old mitochondria\nmixing old stuff together, right?\nSo, why wouldn't you want\nto bring up new, healthy,\nyoung mitochondria into that pool, right?\nSo, in my mind, when I hear\nmitochondrial biogenesis,\nI'm like, aging.\nThat's the first thing I think of.\nSo, anyways, cold exposure does that.\nOther things as well, so.\n- Amazing.\nAnd please, thank you for offering\nto somehow filter the level of detail,\nbut I assure you that\nlisteners of this podcast\nare familiar with drinking from\nthe fire hose of mechanism,\nand that was really helpful.\nAnd, again, this is just\none example of maybe four\nor five other things that\nyou've said, at least,\nthat are going to inspire\nme to change my behaviors.\nI'm going to start doing some\nhigh-intensity interval training.\nDr. Andy Galpin was on\nthis podcast recently,\nand he told me that the\nsubtle zone 2 cardio\nand the weight training's great,\nbut that I really should be doing\nsome max heart rate work per week,\ngoing into max heart rate for 90 seconds,\nthen resting and repeating\nthat, maybe even mild repeats.\nI'm just curious, as a brief aside,\nbefore we talk about heat,\nwhat sort of cardiovascular\nor other types of training do you do?\nDo you do HIT?\nI imagine you are doing\nhigh-intensity interval training.\nIf you could just give\nus a sense of the contour\nof your week as it relates to exercise.\nBecause you've been very gracious\nin sharing some of what you\ndo for supplements and food,\nwhat about exercise?\n- So it all depends on my week, of course,\nand what I've got going on with\nmy son and my work schedule.\nBut I do a lot of\nhigh-intensity interval Tabatas\non a stationary cycle.\nI use Peloton because I just\nlike that instructor there\ntelling me what to do,\nand then me competing with everyone else.\nI'm like, ah, you know?\nSo it works for me.\n- You're revealing something\nabout your psychology.\nThis is good. We just learned about.\nSo this podcast is actually just a decoy\nfor psychological assessment of the guest.\nNo, I'm kidding.\nSo, now, we know you're competitive.\nGood.\n- [Rhonda] Yeah.\n- That explains a lot of how\nyou got through graduate school\nand then do what you do.\nSo you're getting on the Peloton,\nand what does it look like\nfor someone who's not\nfamiliar with Peloton?\nI know what they are, but\nI've never been on one.\nYou're pedaling against the\ninstructor for how many seconds?\n- So there's a bunch of\npeople that are online,\neither doing the class with you\nat the same time or all time doing it,\nso you can kind of\ntoggle on what you want,\nand you can try to compete\nagainst the all time number.\n- So it's really competitive.\n- [Rhonda] Oh, yeah.\n- Okay.\n- And the instructor is just\nthere to, like, whip you.\nYou know, make you.\nThe brilliance with Peloton is...\nI used to do what's called rush cycle.\nIt's basically you go in and group cycle\nand have an instructor there,\nand you do all this high-intensity\ninterval training stuff.\nAnd I loved it because there\nwas a competitive aspect to it\nthat had me working\nharder than I would work\nif it was just me in the room,\nlike without an instructor\nor anyone there,\nand it was just like,\nI'm at a gym, any gym,\nand I'm just on a stationary cycle\nlistening to a podcast, doing something,\nwhich is fine if that's\nyour groove, right?\nBut there is something\nabout that group setting\nthat kind of holds you\naccountable too, right?\nAnd the Peloton made it somehow\nvirtual. It was amazing.\nAnd I remember being back at rush cycle,\nthis is before pandemic,\nand people talking about\nPeloton in my class,\nand I'm like, \"Oh, that's\nridiculous. Why would I do that?\n\"That's never going to\nwork. I need to be here.\"\nAnd then, the pandemic hit and\nI was all over the Peloton,\nand it works for me really well.\nSo I tend to do that at\nleast three times a week.\nSometimes I do it more, like I'll do four.\nAnd I do a 10 minute, just 10,\nbecause it's efficient, and I push my ass.\nI push myself really hard.\n- That's the Tabata.\n- It's 20 seconds on, 10 seconds\noff, and it's 10 minutes.\n- And on means you're pedaling\nlike your life depended on it.\n- [Rhonda] You're maxing it.\n- And there's a lot of\nresistance in the pedals?\n- I always do resistance.\nI like the power. I do the power.\nThere's a part where\nyou're sitting cycling,\nand you're trying to go really fast,\nbut I always crank the resistance up.\nI always go above what they give me.\nAnd then, there's a part\nwhere you're standing,\nand then you really\ncrank the resistance up,\nwhich I really do, and you\nfeel it in your glutes.\n- It's like going up a hill.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nAnd so they break it up,\nand most of the time you'll\nhave those two parts.\nAnd I love the efficiency of it.\nYou get it done.\nAnd people sometimes\nhear me, go, \"10 minutes?\n\"Oh, really? You think you work?\"\nI'm like, look, you do\nmax Tabata for 10 minutes,\nand it's intense.\n- Yeah, most people\ncan't sprint for the gate\nof an airplane they're about\nto miss, carrying a backpack.\nSo, if I think about that,\nand I've just described myself,\nsprinting through the airport and going,\n\"All right, Andy Galpin,\n\"I got my 90 seconds max\nheart rate in for you,\n\"carrying this thing.\"\nBut 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off,\nrepeating that over and\nover for 10 minutes,\nso, by the time you're\ndone, you're cooked.\n- And then, because I'm competitive\nduring the recovery that\nthey give you at the end,\nI'm pushing it max, so I\nget the numbers higher.\n- Great.\nSo three times a week.\n- [Rhonda] It's a trick.\n- Yeah, three times a week,\nand then I always have my\nsauna on preheating up,\ntakes about an hour and a half,\nand I get it to about\n189 degrees Fahrenheit.\nI hop right in the sauna after my Peloton.\n- So the elevated heart rate continues.\nIs that the rationale?\n- Yeah, I literally down a bunch of water,\nand then I get in,\nand then I either read a science paper,\nprepare for a presentation or a podcast,\nor I hash over things in my mind.\nAnd it's interesting\nbecause something about\ngetting in the sauna,\nI think the stress, the heat stress of it.\nSo I started doing the sauna\nin 2009 in graduate school.\n- You're an early adopter.\n- I started doing it every\nday. I lived across the street.\nI lived in a studio apartment with Dan.\nWe lived in this small studio apartment,\nsmallest apartment you could ever imagine,\nand it was across the street from a YMCA,\n'cause I was poor in graduate school,\nvery poor, very poor.\n- I recall. I lived in my lab.\n- Wow, really?\n- But, then again, I lived\nin my lab as a postdoc.\nI admit, I lived in my lab with my bulldog\nas a faculty member for other reasons.\nBut I get it.\nWhen you're a graduate student,\nyou're poor, basically.\n- Yes, and so I used to go to the sauna\nbefore going into the lab,\nand I started noticing that\nI was, all of a sudden,\nable to handle stress better,\nlike the stress of my six-month setback\nbecause of a failed\nexperiment, which is crushing,\non top of the pressure from\nmy advisor and my own pressure\n'cause I'm very competitive with myself,\nand I put a lot of pressure on myself.\nSo I was having a hard time.\nI was very stressed\nout in graduate school.\nAnd this sauna started to\nreally noticeably affect\nmy anxiety and my\nability to handle stress.\nAnd I was like, what is going on here?\nSo I started looking into the literature\nand started getting interested\nin the effects on the brain.\nAnd, in fact, at the time, I had a friend\nwho was not actually experimentally\nbut theoretically looking\ninto the opioid system.\nSo, when you get in the sauna,\nyou release a lot of endorphins.\nEndorphins are the feel-good opioids\nthat make you feel good,\nbut you also release\nsomething called dynorphin.\nAnd dynorphin is an endogenous opioid\nthat binds to a receptor called\nthe kappa opioid receptor.\nDynorphin is responsible\nfor that dysphoric feeling\nwhen you're in the sauna and you're hot,\nand when you're running, doing exercise,\nand you feel uncomfortable.\nWell, I think that's dynorphin.\nI'm speaking absolute,\nbut I think it is.\n- No, I think it is.\nI mean, there's evidence in alcoholics\nthat some of the symptoms of\nwithdrawal that they experience\nare related to dynorphin.\nAnd dynorphin is known\nto negatively impact\nthe dopamine receptor system.\nSo, basically, it's the\nfeel-like-garbage pathway.\n- Right, you feel like garbage,\nand so you think that\nthat would not be good,\nbut this is where my friend comes in.\nHe was looking at the effects\nof treating morphine or heroin addiction.\nAnd people that are using those drugs,\nthey, basically, the endorphins\nor the morphine or heroin,\nthey bind to a receptor in the brain\ncalled the mu opioid receptor.\nAnd, as they take these drugs,\nthat mu opioid receptor\nbecomes downregulated,\nand so you need more and more of the drug\nto feel as good as you did.\nWell, endorphins also\nbind to that receptor.\nAnd he was looking into\nsome of the other drugs\nthat are like salvinoria,\nsalvinorin, or something.\nSalvia it's called. It binds\nto the kappa opioid receptor.\nIt also makes you kind\nof feel uncomfortable.\nAnyways, he had put some\nstudies in front of me\nthat showed basically\nbinding of either dynorphin\nor whatever ligand to\nthe kappa opioid receptor\nbasically sensitizes\nthe mu opioid receptor\nto the feel-good endorphins\nand also changes,\nI think it also upregulates\nit or something,\nso, basically, there's a\nlasting effect of feeling good.\nSo the endorphins that you release later\nfrom hugging someone,\nor a joke you're laughing at, or whatever,\nyou feel it for longer, right?\nAnd so, anyways, with\nrespect to the sauna,\nit's a big sort of hypothesis of mine.\nI did kind of publish\nthat part of my hypothesis\nin a review article, but\nI do wish more people\nwould kind of look into that.\nThat'd be amazing.\nBut what I was getting at, I think, was,\nI would use the sauna to memorize things.\nThis is way back in the\nday, and I still do it.\nAnd I wanted to talk to you about this\nbecause you're a neuroscientist,\nthat there's something\nabout being in the sauna.\nAnd I don't know if it has to\ndo with the stress response.\nLike, when you have an emotional trigger,\nyou remember things better, right?\n- Absolutely.\nThere is a clear and known\nexplanation mechanism for this.\n- So, in the sauna, you\nalso release norepinephrine,\njust like you do in the cold.\nThere's a lot of overlap.\nIt is a stressor, but I\nuse it to remember things.\nLike, I'm going through something.\nI want to go through a\npresentation, or a talk,\nor a podcast, or whatever.\nAnd I go in that sauna.\nAnd you should try it,\nif you haven't already.\nI don't know if you have.\n- I have a sauna and Cold Plunge now,\nand I haven't tried preparing.\nI read books in the sauna in the evening.\nIt's a time I insist on\nhaving my phone out of there,\ninitially because I\nthought I'd cook the phone,\nbut also just to get some separation\nfrom the phone and screens in\nthe evening, so I read books.\nThe only challenge,\nsometimes you're dripping\nsweat onto the books,\nbut I'm willing to forego\na few pages of a book.\nThe idea that being in this\nsemi-stressful environment\nwould aid in the learning\nand retention of information\nis really well substantiated.\nThere's this beautiful work\nby a guy named James McGaw.\nI don't know if his lab's still active,\nbut he was at UC Irvine for a while,\nand then I think at\nUniversity of Arizona as well.\nThey have a great memory\ngroup at both places,\nvery strong in learning\nand memory, both places.\nAnd he was the one that really defined\nthis kind of inverted, u-shaped function\nfor the relationship between\nadrenaline and memory.\nBasically, if you're too\nrelaxed and not stressed enough,\nyou're not going to\nremember any information.\nAt peak levels of stress, you\nactually are a memory machine,\nat least within the context\nof whatever it is you're trying to learn.\nSo what you're describing\nvery well matches with that.\nThen, of course, it tapers off\nas you really increase\nadrenaline to the point\nwhere people are starting\nto lose autonomic function,\nwhere they're panicking basically,\nbut obviously, you're keeping it in range.\nThe other thing that I would\nlike to ask you about is,\nin the sauna, of course,\nthere's vasodilation,\nand perfusion of blood to\nthe brain is a wonderful way\nto enhance cognition.\nThere's even some really\nnice data showing that,\nduring inhales as opposed to exhales,\npeople are better at learning information.\nBelieve it or not, during the inhale,\nyou're taking in and absorbing\nand remembering more than during exhales.\nAnd these are beautiful studies\ndone in humans, of course.\nSo I can imagine that vasodilation,\ngetting more perfusion\nof blood to the brain,\nplus a little bit of stress,\nor maybe a lot of stress\nfrom the epinephrine,\nand then, of course,\nthere's going to be the,\nI don't want to call it placebo,\nbut there's going to be the context,\nthe condition, place context of it.\nLike, if we had a good experience\nremembering something in the sauna once,\nthe positive association effect\nof that location is real.\nJust like, if people go to a\nnew city and they get robbed,\nlike, if you go to Cincinnati,\nI've never been to Cincinnati,\nbut you get robbed in Cincinnati,\nyour purse gets taken or\nyour wallet gets taken,\nyou kind of hate Cincinnati as a tourist.\nBut that could happen in any number\nof different cities, right?\nThe opposite is also true,\nso if something good happens someplace.\nSo I'm imagining that it's a\ncombination of those effects,\nbut it would be very hard\nto do this in the cold.\nI feel like the cold is a very potent.\nI think it takes you\ntoo far down that curve,\nthe McGaw curve.\n- I have to sing songs or\nsomething when I'm in there.\n- [Andrew] Distract yourself.\n- Oh yeah, I sing songs.\n- But afterward, you're\nvery efficient at learning.\n- After I am.\nWith respect to the sauna,\nthe vasodilation does occur,\nso there's a lot of overlap\nbetween moderate-intensity\naerobic exercise and heat stress.\nAs you can imagine,\nwhen you're exercising,\nyou're elevating your\ncore body temperature.\nYou're sweating.\nWhen you're actually in the sauna,\nblood does get redistributed to the skin\nto facilitate sweating,\nbut, much like exercise, blood\nflow in general is improved\nto the brain, to the muscles, everywhere.\nSo, I think, generally speaking,\nand there's studies showing\nthat sauna use is associated\nwith a much lower risk of\ndementia and Alzheimer's disease.\nPeople that use it four\nto seven times a week\nhave greater than 60%\nreduction in dementia\nand Alzheimer's disease risk\ncompared to once-\n- Amazing, how many?\nOh, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.\nYou said people who use it,\nI apologize, but maybe\nyou could tell us again,\npeople use it four to seven\ntimes per week have...\n- They have a greater than 60% reduction\nin dementia risk and\nAlzheimer's disease risk\ncompared to people that use\nit only one time a week.\nPeople that use it two\nto three times a week\nhave something like a 20,\na little greater than\n20% reduction in risk.\nThere's a dose-dependent\neffect on dementia risk\nand Alzheimer's disease risk.\nIt also has a profound.\nThere's a big link\nbetween the cardiovascular\nsystem and the brain.\nObviously, blood flow, a big one, right?\nYou need to get blood to your brain.\nBut cardiovascular mortality,\nso mortality from cardiovascular disease.\nIf people use, or actually this was men.\nIf men use the sauna four\nto seven times a week,\nit's a 50% reduction in\ncardiovascular related mortality\ncompared to one time a week.\nAgain, dose-dependent manner,\ntwo to three times a week\nis something like 24% lower death\nfrom cardiovascular disease.\nThere's also lower sudden cardiac deaths,\nlike a heart attack.\nThat's like 60 something,\ngreater than 60% lower,\nif men use it four to seven\ntimes a week versus once.\nAgain, a dose-dependent thing.\nThe thing that's so\nprofound there also to me\nwhen, again, looking at the methods,\nwhen I look at the data,\nand this is all work\nfrom Dr. Jari Laukkanen.\nHe's in the University of Eastern Finland\nand just one of the world\nexperts on sauna use,\nespecially with respect\nto cardiovascular health.\nWhat some of his data\nhas also shown is that,\nif you look at the duration,\nthe time spent in the sauna,\nso I mentioned the\ntemperature I do is about,\nI do 189 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTypically, I go in there.\nI'm pretty heat adapted.\nSo the more you do the sauna\nor any sort of heat stress,\nwhether it's a hot tub or\njacuzzi, you become adapted.\nYou basically start to sweat\nat a lower core body temperature\nto cool yourself down.\nAll these sort of physiological changes\nstart to happen earlier.\nAnd so, I stayed in for like 30 minutes,\nso I stayed in a long time.\nThat's a lot. You have\nto listen to your body.\nMost of the studies that\nI just talked about,\nthe duration, the time spent in the sauna,\nwhen I said 50% reduction\nin cardiovascular disease related death,\nwhat was shown was that\nmen that were in the sauna\nfor only 11 minutes,\neven if they used it four\nto seven times a week,\nthat reduction was only\nlike 8% instead of 50.\nIt had to be greater than 19 minutes,\nso like 20 minutes is the sweet spot,\nat about 174 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAnd most of the saunas\nin Finland, by the way,\nthey're humid, so they put hot water,\nthey put water on hot\nrocks to create steam,\nso it's usually between 10 to 20% humidity\nin the Finnish sauna.\nSo those studies were, I\nwould say, most of the time,\nyou're going to find that their\nhumidity is also elevated.\nBut, to me, the\ndose-dependent nature of it\nand the duration,\nto me, that's very strong\ndata that this is more causal\nthan some corollary thing.\nBecause that's always the problem\nwith observational\nstudies, including these,\nwhich they corrected for\na whole host of factors,\nlike cholesterol,\nexercise, just everything,\neverything under the sun,\nthey corrected for those.\nAnd, on top of that,\nyou have the dose-dependent\nnature of the duration,\nthe time spent in the\nsauna, and the frequency.\nSo, to me, it's like,\nsomething's going on here.\n- Yeah.\n- Plus there's been studies,\nintervention studies,\nwhere it's comparing\ndirectly, head-to-head\nmoderate-intensity aerobic\nexercise on a stationary cycle\nto 20 minutes in a sauna.\nPhysiologically the same things happen,\nso heart rate elevates while\nyou're doing the activity,\nblood pressure increases while\nyou're doing the activity,\nbut then, after, heart rate decreases,\nresting heart rate\ndecreases below baseline,\nblood pressure is improved, so\nit decreases below baseline.\nThis is happening the same\nin moderate-intensity\ncycling versus sauna.\nSo, again, the sauna, this heat stress,\nthere's something about\nit that really mimics\nthis moderate-intensity aerobic exercise,\nwhich is really great for\npeople that can't go for a run,\nthat can't even get on a\nbike, so disabled people.\nGranted, there are some safety concerns.\nThey're pretty mild, but they do exist.\nSo people that had a recent heart attack\nor have some rare kind of\nheart disease or problem.\nDrinking alcohol, never do that.\nElderly people prone\nto low blood pressure.\nAlways talk to a physician\nbefore doing the sauna.\nIt is stressful.\n- Pregnant.\n- Pregnant women, yeah.\nI definitely avoided\nsaunas when I was pregnant.\nI think it's very relevant\nfor disabled people\nand also people that are sedentary\nor been sedentary most of their life.\nLike, my mother, I've been\nable to get her in the sauna\nbecause she's not.\nI did get her on the Peloton once,\nbut it's really much easier.\nShe feels like it's a spa treatment,\nand she can listen to her music in there.\nLike, I care about her health,\nbut she's mostly been a sedentary person.\nAnd so I find it much\neasier to convince her\nto get in the sauna\nthan to get on Peloton.\nIdeally, you do both.\nThe question would be,\nwell, I exercise, I run,\nI do my high-intensity interval training.\nWhy do I need to get in the sauna?\nAnd the reality is,\nand so I published all this in a review\nin the Experimental Dermatology\nlast year, I guess, late last year.\nBasically, cardiorespiratory fitness,\nwhich is a marker of,\nit's a marker of health.\nCardiorespiratory fitness is improved\nin people that do exercise and sauna\ncompared to exercise alone or sauna alone.\nSo, for those healthy,\nfit people out there\nalready exercising,\nthere's a synergistic effect\nby also adding a sauna into that routine.\nAnd, to me, that's great.\nAnd there's so many beneficial things\nhappening with the heat stress.\nIn addition to mimicking aerobic exercise,\nthere's the heat shock proteins\nthat we talked about earlier.\nAnd those, it kind of brings me back\nto my early days of science\nwhen I at the Salk Institute\nfor Biological Studies\ndoing research on little\nnematode worms that we\nor someone else injected amyloid beta 42,\nthe peptide, the 42-amino\nacid peptide that is involved\nin amyloid plaques found in the brain\ncorrelating with Alzheimer's disease\nand other brain disorders.\nWe injected those into the\nmuscle tissue of worms.\nAnd, basically, these worms\nbecome paralyzed with age\nbecause the aggregated proteins,\nthese proteins aggregate.\nWell, heat shock proteins,\none of the main things they\ndo is they basically make sure\nthe proteins inside of your cells\nmaintain their proper\nthree-dimensional structure\nand are folded right, and so they don't,\nthey're not prone to aggregating\nand forming these plaques\nin your arteries and also in the brain.\nBack to my worm studies I was doing,\nI would elevate heat shock\nproteins in these worms,\nand it would totally correct the problem,\nwhere they would no\nlonger become paralyzed.\nThey'd move around like they were young.\nSo, many animal studies have been done\nlooking at Alzheimer's disease,\na human-like Alzheimer's\ndisease in a rodent,\nand heat shock proteins\nprotecting from it.\nHeat shock proteins are\nrobustly activated in humans.\nThis has been shown to,\neven 50% higher over baseline\nlevels after just 30 minutes\nat 163 degrees Fahrenheit in the sauna.\nAnd they stay activated,\nat least, in rodents,\nfor 48 hours, at least.\nSo having these heat\nshock proteins around,\nmaking sure they're properly\ntaking care of our proteins\nso they're not aggregating in\nour brains and in our plaques,\ncould be another potential\nway that sauna's protecting\nfrom Alzheimer's disease and\nother cardiovascular health\nas well as longevity.\nThere's people that have SNPs\nin heat shock protein factor 70\nthat, if they have one of them,\nso they got one from their parents\nwhere they have more active\nheat shock protein 70,\nthey live on average one year longer\nthan people that don't have that SNP.\nAnd if they have two versions,\nif they got one from their\nmom and one from their dad,\nthey live on average two years longer\nthan people that don't have that SNP.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- So it's also been associated\nwith human longevity as\nwell as in lower organisms.\nSo you can heat shock a worm or a fly\nand they live 15% longer.\nThis is work done by Gordon\nLithgow at the Buck Institute\nyears and years ago.\nSo, anyways,\nI guess what I was getting at\nwas the heat shock proteins\nare part of that stress response pathway\nthat we talked about earlier.\nThey're also activated by cold as well.\nCold shock does activate\nheat shock proteins.\nNot as robust. Sulforaphane\nactivates them.\nAgain, it's one of the reasons\nI think we should get all of these things\nbecause they are more robust inputs.\nThe input activating\nmechanisms are more robust\nfor different ones.\nSo there is crosstalk.\nI guess it'd be more accurate\nto say there's overlap.\nBut it's also like,\nyou want to get the most\nrobust from all of them, right?\nI do, so that's why I want\nto do the sauna and exercise\nand eat my broccoli\nsprouts and all that stuff.\n- It's super interesting.\nA couple of questions came up for me.\nOne is, you mentioned these SNPs,\nthese nucleotide repeats,\nbasically genes that\nsome people have more of\nor less of than others\nthat can predict longevity in some sense.\nIs that the FOXO3 pathway?\n- That's one that can.\nYeah, I mean, FOXO3 is, in fact,\nif you go back to the worm\nstudies I was talking about,\nthat was one of the first things\nwhen you see it with your own eyes.\nYou can take these worms that,\nyou basically decrease their\ninsulin signaling pathway\nand their IGF-1.\nWorms have what are\ncalled homologous genes,\nso they have a lot of\nsimilarities to humans.\nThey have an insulin-like receptor,\nthey have an IGF-1-like receptor,\nand they make something\nlike FOXO3, which we have.\nAnd, basically, if you decrease\nthat insulin signaling pathway,\nthen FOXO3 is always\nactive in those worms,\nand they live like 100% longer.\nAnd not only do they live longer,\nthey are like a very young worm.\nI mean, you look at this\nthing and you're like,\n\"This looks like the worm that\nwas just born like hours ago.\n\"What's going on? This thing's\nat the end of its life.\"\nNow, as a side note,\nthe thing that always got me on this was,\nby the way, this was\ndiscovered by Cynthia Kenyon.\nThis was back in the '90s.\nHonestly, I'm not sure that anything\nhas been as exciting in\nthe worm world since then,\nbut I thought it was a really big finding.\nThe only caveat there\nis that the worms go through this dauer.\nIt's called a dauer\nstage when this happens,\nwhen you decrease their\ninsulin signaling and stuff,\nand they go into this\nlike metabolic stasis.\nThey're not eating as much or moving.\nAnd so it's like, okay,\nwell they live 100% longer,\nbut they go into this\nweird state, you know?\n- I know people like this,\nsome in the longevity community.\nThey know who they are.\nBut they'll get the last\nlaugh 'cause I'll be dead,\nwell fed but dead, and\nthey'll still be going.\nSo, in terms of the many data on sauna,\nand I also just want to\nacknowledge these Finnish groups\nthat did this work.\nIt's really pioneering, right?\nWhen you think 20 years ago,\nlong before social media or any of this,\nand they're out there,\nup there, I should say,\nmeasuring cortisol and growth\nhormone and all this stuff\nin people getting in and out of sauna.\nVery, very interesting.\nSo 20 minutes seems like the threshold\nat 170 degrees Fahrenheit.\nMore times per week seems\nto be better than fewer\nin terms of all-cause\nmortality, cardiovascular risk\naccording to what I just learned from you.\n- Four would be a good, I\nthink, minimum effective dose.\n- Four times a week, and you\ncombine it with the cold.\nI've also seen a protocol, where,\nit's a very extreme protocol,\nI don't recommend this to\npeople right off the bat,\nwhere they had human subjects\nget into the sauna for 30\nminutes, get out for five,\n30 minutes, get out for five, 30 minutes,\nfor a total of two hours of exposure,\nbut that was what led to these\nmassive 16-fold increases\nin growth hormone.\nAnd they had to do it very seldom.\nSo it sounds like these\nprotocols you're describing,\n20 minutes done four times per week,\nare far more reasonable\nfor most people to access.\nBut I know people are\nprobably desperate to know,\nwhat if they don't have a sauna?\nA sauna is kind of a unique item,\nso I have a couple questions.\nCan people use hot baths?\nWith the appropriate warning, of course.\nWithout getting into description\nof the mechanics and\nthe underlying biology,\nit's pretty obvious that the testes,\nif they get too warm, you'll kill sperm.\nThat's the reason why\nthe testes are housed\nin a structure called the\nscrotum that can move around,\nso just to be, you know,\nwe are biologists, just\ntalking about realities here.\nSo, if you're trying to conceive children\nor keep your sperm healthy,\nguys should probably stay\nout of warm, hot baths.\n- For at least six months.\nThat's been shown.\n- [Andrew] Six months.\n- So sperm motility goes down\nand sperm production goes down,\nbut that is completely corrected\nif they stay out of the\nsauna for six months.\nSo through six months\nlater, it's back to normal.\n- Great, that's a very\nuseful information, I'm sure,\nto a number of people out there.\nSo, if people don't\nhave access to a sauna,\nand we get this about cold too.\nPeople always say, \"What\nabout cold showers?\"\nAnd I always say, well,\nthe studies have mainly\nbeen done on immersion\n'cause it's hard to keep things\ncontrolled in cold showers.\nIt just doesn't make for\na very good experiment\n'cause you get a bigger person,\nless of them is under the shower,\nand so it doesn't make\nfor a good experiment.\nSo it's not as good as immersion,\nbut, with heat, I could\nimagine that a hot bath\nwould work almost as well.\n- Yeah, so there's been\nsome studies looking at,\nfor example, activation\nof heat shock proteins,\nalso brain-derived\nneurotrophic factor increases\nwith heat stress.\nAnd so the hot bath at around\n104 degrees Fahrenheit,\nwhich is typically what studies\nwill use for temperature,\nwhich is actually cooler than what I.\nI crank my bath hot. It's so hot.\n- But you're very heat adapted.\n- I'm very heat adapted, yeah.\nAnd it's 20 minutes\nfrom the shoulders down,\nand that is a very robust\nactivation in heat shock proteins\nand in brain-derived neurotrophic factor.\nAnd then, heat shock\nproteins are also protecting\nagainst muscle atrophy,\nso that's also having to do\nwith the protein structure\nand the muscle tissue as well.\nAnd this has been studies in animal data\nas well as some recent human data as well.\nIt was local hyperthermia\nor local heat treatment,\nbut essentially it\nshowed that it protected.\nThere was a study where they\nwere looking at muscle disuse,\nand it was something like\nthe local heat treatment\nprevented almost 40% of the\nmuscle atrophy from disuse.\nAnd it's funny 'cause\nI used to use the sauna\nwhen I was injured and stuff.\nI would go in the sauna.\nBecause I didn't know at the time\n'cause I was a graduate student,\nbut I knew just from experiments\nthat I'm not losing as much muscle.\nI feel better.\nAt the time, I was reading\nall about the growth hormone\nand stuff back then.\nAnd I knew about heat shock proteins,\nso I kind of knew, but that\ndata wasn't around yet,\nand so now we have the data.\nAnd I've always felt like\nI wasn't losing my muscle,\nlike I should've been,\nwhen I was doing the sauna.\nAnd I was doing it\nliterally seven days a week.\nIt was hardcore.\n- This is also during graduate school?\n- Yeah, now, I'm doing the sauna,\nlike a bare minimum, I do\nthree, but I try to do four.\nIt all depends on my schedule.\nI also like to do long runs.\nLong being like three miles,\nnot like campaigns, which are long.\nBut I really, for me,\nand we were talking about\nthis earlier off camera\nthat the runs, for me, are for my brain.\nAnd I'd get this mind-wandering effect,\nwhere I daydream and I think about things.\nI work through problems.\nI get creative. I come up with ideas.\nAnd this is all happening on the runs.\nAnd so I miss my runs if I don't do 'em,\nand I miss it because of the\nbrain effects I get from it.\nAnd when I exercise, it's funny,\nbecause I'm a female, and you'd\nthink that I'd be exercising\nto stay fit and in shape\nand care about my figure,\nbut, when I exercise,\nliterally what I'm\nthinking about is my brain.\nAnd I'm like, \"This is the\nbest longevity drug there is.\n\"This is it right here, Rhonda.\n\"You're always wondering.\nYou're always wanting to know.\n\"You're wanting to do the best.\"\nIf you don't exercise, you're\nmissing that essential dose.\nAnd so that, for me, is the motivation,\nthe dopamine seeking\nthing I'm looking for.\nAdmittedly, I do not do\nenough strength training.\nAnd I have to do it. Have\nto, have to, have to.\nI'm so after the endurance and the HIT,\nand I really need to add that in.\nBecause muscle mass is\nalso extremely important\nfor aging as well, you know?\nSo that's my fault.\n- Well, the brain effects\nare really interesting.\nI also run.\nI try and get one longer run\nper week and a few other runs,\nand I do it without a phone.\nI don't listen to podcasts.\nI occasionally will listen to music,\nbut I really try not to.\nI also find that my mind solves problems.\nI feel like it washes out\nthe cobwebs, so to speak.\nSome of the most brilliant\nand prolific neuroscientists that I know\nwho've had very long careers.\nEric Kandel, Nobel Prize\nwinner at Columbia,\ncomes to mind for all his work on memory,\nused to swim a mile a day,\nand now I think swims half a mile a day,\nbut he's in his late 90s\nand he's still sharp,\nwhich is incredible.\nAnd his lab has done some work showing\nthat any load-bearing exercise\nrepeated, so endurance work,\nunlike the Peloton or cycling,\nthat's really load-bearing,\nalthough you're cycling really\nhard with the resistance,\nbut causes the release of\nosteocalcin from the bones,\nwhich acts in an endocrine\nway, sort of like a hormone,\ncan actually travel to the hippocampus\nand, at least in these animal studies,\ninduce the proliferation of\nneurons, growth of synapses,\nBDNF, a number of downstream things,\nwhich kind of makes sense,\nif we were to put a just so\nevolutionary story on this.\nA body that's active\ncan signal to the brain\nthat the body still needs cognition.\nAn inactive body, in some ways,\nis depriving the brain of any signal\nabout what the body is doing, right?\nObviously, I'm making\nthis up as conjecture,\nbut we know in various ocean animals\nthat they'll swim around for\nsome period of their life,\nand then they'll have\na completely stationary\nportion of their life,\nand basically, the brain degenerates.\nYou don't need much of a nervous system\nif you're not moving.\nSo I think there's really something there,\nand also just letting\nthe ideas and mind drift.\nI love that you,\nand I appreciate that you\nshared your protocols,\nbecause I think, right now,\nwe're in an interesting time\nin public health information history,\nwhere people are just\nkind of getting bombarded\nwith cold is good, heat is gold.\nCold is good. Heat is good.\nExcuse me, I misspoke.\nThere are all these micronutrients,\nand, of course, macronutrients\nare important too.\nToday, you've really enriched\nus with the description\nof the underlying mechanisms\nand the logic behind them,\nbut also sharing what you\ndo is really informative\nbecause I think people\nneed a jumping-off place,\nand obviously they need\nto start someplace,\nand getting heat adapted,\net cetera, takes time.\nBut I really appreciate\nthat you're willing to\nshare your protocols\nand that you do the things that you teach\nand educate people about.\nAs a final question,\nbecause I have to ask,\nred light sauna or no red light sauna?\nI've been a little bit\nvocal about my feelings\nthat none of the red light\nsaunas I've ever been in\ngot hot enough, and it was frustrating,\nso I feel like it's\nneither here nor there.\nHowever, I do acknowledge that red light\nand low-level light therapies\nare now known to do a number\nof interesting things.\nThere was a Nobel Prize in 1908\nfor phototherapy for lupus,\nso it's not like a new thing\nthe idea that light could do things\npositive for our biology.\nBut, do you have a red\nlight in your sauna?\nDo you think it's useful?\nAnd I mention this because\nthis is the number one question\nI get about sauna,\nred light or no red light,\nor some intermediate answer.\n- So I don't have an infrared sauna,\nbut I have a sauna that has lights.\nIt makes red light, but I\ndon't think it's the red light\nthat you're talking about.\n- Okay.\n- It's not activating it\nat a specific wavelength,\nwhich is...\n- It's usually, so the range\nthat seems to be helpful,\nand, I confess, I use a red\nlight panel for other things,\nis 670 nanometer\nout to about 720 nanometer,\nso it looks like red and very dim lights,\ndim red and bright red.\nAnd the idea is that red light can travel,\nthe photon and energy is\nsuch that it can travel down\nthrough the deep layers\nof the dermis of the skin.\n- I don't have a red light in my sauna.\nI don't know if it's essential\nor not. I don't think so.\nBased on all the studies\nI've talked about, I think,\nthe potential effect on\nmitochondria is interesting.\nI do think there's a lack\nof really good, solid evidence in humans,\nbut that might only be because\nit's just not studied enough.\nAnd that's usually the case, so perhaps.\nThere's the Joovv, right? The Joovv.\nThey have those red\nlight panels and stuff.\n- Joovv and KOZE are the two ones I know,\nK-O-Z-E and Joovv.\nAs far as I know,\nI'm probably going to insult\nboth companies at the same time,\nbut I'd rather insult\nthem both at the same time\nthan just compliment one or insult one.\nBoth of them seem excellent\nfor getting the appropriate\nwavelengths of red light.\nAnd I do not have a relationship\nto either of those.\n- Yeah.\nWell, I personally think that\nthe sauna in and of itself,\nit's about the heat stress.\nAnd typically the question I get is,\ninfrared sauna or regular sauna?\nAnd there are some differences as well.\nInfrared saunas.\nMaybe the infrared saunas are the ones\nthat have the red light\nthat you're talking about.\nInfrared saunas only get up to\naround 140 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSo, as I mentioned,\nthe studies were about\n174 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAnd so you really have to stay\nin a longer period of time.\nHowever, there have been some\nstudies coming out of Japan.\nThey use infrared sauna.\nThey have this whole protocol.\nIt's called Waon therapy.\nThey get people in infrared saunas,\nand then they wrap 'em in a towel,\nand they stay warm for X amount.\nSo the whole protocol ends\nup being like an hour long,\nbut, again, it's 140 degrees Fahrenheit,\nso it's an infrared sauna,\nand it's been shown to\nimprove a variety of,\nlike, coronary heart\ndisease and conditions,\nheart-related conditions.\nThere have been some improvements.\nSo, obviously, there's\nevidence that infrared saunas\ncan be beneficial for\ncardiovascular health.\nI've used infrared saunas\nmany times at my in-laws.\nThey have an infrared sauna.\nAnd I have to crank that\nthing up for a while\nuntil it's maxed,\nand then I have to sit in\nthere for an hour at least.\nI do sweat a lot,\nand that's another thing\nwe didn't talk about.\nYou do sweat some heavy metals.\nAnd some heavy metals are\nexcreted predominantly\nthrough sweat and others through urine.\nSo, for example, cadmium,\nthere's like a 125-fold increase\nin cadmium excretion from sweat\nwhen you get in the sauna.\nAlso, lead is something like\n17-fold excretions higher.\nAnother one is aluminum.\nIt's about fourfold higher.\nSo infrared, you do sweat a lot too,\nand that's because the main difference\nis that you're heating your body up\nthrough thermal radiation\nversus the ambient air.\nA standard sauna is a heater,\nand the heater's heating up the air,\nand that's how you're heating yourself up.\nSo it is a little bit of\na different mechanism.\nI prefer regular saunas.\nMost of the data out there is\nfrom the heat stress itself.\nLike, your heart rate's\nelevating when you're in there.\nYou're feeling hot. You're\ngetting that cardiovascular.\nThat's what you're feeling\nwhen you're in a hot sauna.\nAnd that, for me, takes a really long time\nin the infrared sauna,\nlike at the very end.\nBut I do think there are\nsome benefits from infrared.\nAnd they are more affordable.\nThey're less of a fire hazard.\nBut, again, hot baths are, I think,\na good alternative\nmodality for heat stress\ncompared to like a regular sauna.\n- Great, that's a really helpful answer.\nLike I said, I use the red\nlight, but not in the sauna.\nAnd thank you for reminding us\nof that 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold\nthat is mainly used in all these studies.\nWe covered a lot of territory,\nbut I just want to thank you again.\nIt was extremely thorough\nand extremely informative.\nMy notes always look a little\nbit like they were drawn out\nby a macaque monkey who has no knowledge\nof the English language,\nbut I can decipher this\nto tell you that there\nare at least 10 additions\nto my current protocols\nthat I'm going to add.\nAnd I'll have lots of questions,\nso I apologize in advance for that.\nBut, on behalf of the listeners\nand just directly from me,\nthank you so much for your time.\nI learned a ton.\n- My pleasure.
