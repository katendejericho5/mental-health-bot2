    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are talking\nabout the science of heat,\nand more specifically the\nscience of heating, the verb,\nmeaning how our body heats up\nfrom both the outside and the inside.\nHeat is a remarkable stimulus,\nmeaning when we are in a hot environment,\nit has a profound effect on our biology.\nAnd heating up from the outside,\nor as you'll soon learn, from the inside,\nhas a profound effect on\nmany different aspects\nof our health, including our metabolism,\nboth in the immediate and long term;\nour cognition, meaning\nour ability to think\nmore or less clearly.\nAnd if you're immediately\nthinking that heating up\nmakes you less capable of\nthinking, you're wrong.\nHeat applied properly as a stimulus\ncan engage certain neurochemical systems\nin your brain and body\nthat can allow your brain\nto function far better.\nWe will talk about those data today.\nSo we're going to talk about\nthe science of heat and heating,\nboth in terms of their mechanisms.\nAnd, as I know many of\nyou are interested in,\nthe tools related to the use of heat,\nthings like sauna, how often to do sauna,\nhow long to be in the sauna,\nhow hot to be in the sauna\nfor particular goals and outcomes.\nWe're also going to talk about\nthe very exciting new science\naround local heating.\nThat is the use of heat applied\nto specific areas of the\nbody in order to heal\nor improve tissues at that\nlocation that you are heating\nas well as your biology\nand health overall.\nIn fact, we are going to talk about one\nvery recently published paper\nthat came out in the journal Cell.\nCell is one of the three apex journals,\nmeaning three of the most competitive,\nmost rigorous scientific journals.\nThose are Nature, Science, and Cell.\nThis particular paper\nwas published in Cell,\nand I will go into it\nin more detail later,\nbut basically what this paper shows\nis that by locally\nheating up skin and fat,\nyou can change the identity\nof certain fat cells\nat that location and elsewhere.\nWe have three kinds of fat,\nwhite fat, beige fat, and brown fat.\nAnd as you will learn more about soon,\nwhite fat is not very\nmetabolically active.\nIt's more of a fuel reserve.\nIt's what we typically\nthink of as blubbery fat.\nBeige fat and brown fat\nare rich in mitochondria,\nand those mitochondria\nprovide a sort of furnace\nor heating mechanism for your entire body\nand increase your metabolism\nand the burning of white fat.\nSo in other words,\nhaving more beige fat and\nbrown fat is a good thing.\nAnd it turns out that\nthe proper application\nof heat to specific areas of your body\ncan increase the conversion\nof white fat to beige fat.\nIn other words, turn an\ninnocuous fuel source\ninto a metabolically active tissue\nthat can help you burn off more white fat.\nI think many people are going\nto be interested in this paper\nand the tools that emerge from this paper.\nIt's a fascinating set of findings\nthat actually emerged\nfrom an understanding\nof the biology of burn and\npeople who receive intense burns.\nAnd that is not what I'm\ngoing to recommend to you\nas a tool, of course,\nbut understanding a\nlittle bit about how burns\nimpact our biology and health\nhas allowed these pioneering researchers\nto develop new tools to combat\nobesity and metabolic disorders,\nand that you can apply for\nbasic things like fat loss.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nOur motivation for\npartnering with Momentous\nis to provide people one location\nwhere they can go to access\nthe highest quality supplements\nin the specific dosages\nthat are best supported\nby the scientific research\nand that are discussed\nduring various episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nIf you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,\nyou'll see those formulations.\nI should mention that we are\ngoing to add more formulations\nin the months to come,\nand you'll see specific suggestions\nabout how best to take those supplements,\nmeaning what dosages and times of day,\nand in fact, how to\ncombine those supplements\nwith specific behavioral protocols\nthat have been discussed on the podcast\nand are science supported\nin order to drive the maximum benefit\nfrom those supplements.\nAnd many of you will probably\nalso be pleased to learn\nthat Momentous ships not just\nwithin the United States,\nbut also internationally.\nSo once again, if you go to\nlive momentus.com/huberman,\nyou will find what we firmly believe to be\nthe best quality supplements\nin the precise dosages\nand the best protocols\nfor taking those supplements,\nalong with the ideal behavioral protocols\nto combine with those\nsupplement formulations.\nI'm pleased to announce\nthat I am hosting two\nlive events in May 2022.\nThe first live event will take place\nin Seattle, Washington on May 17th.\nThe second live event will take place\nin Portland, Oregon on May 18th.\nBoth are part of a lecture series entitled\nThe Brain Body Contract,\nduring which I will talk about science\nand science-based tools,\nmany of which overlap with the topics\ncovered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut most of which will not\nand will be completely\nnew topics and tools\nnever discussed publicly before.\nBoth live events will also include\na question and answer period,\nduring which you, the audience,\ncan ask me questions directly\nabout any aspect of science\nor science-based tools,\nand I will attempt to answer them.\nTickets for the two events, again,\nSeattle on May 17th and\nPortland on May 18th,\nare both available at\nhubermanlab.com/tour.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand none of what you\ndon't need, meaning sugar.\nIt has electrolytes, and\nthe main electrolytes\nare sodium, potassium, and magnesium,\nwhich you need in the proper ratios\nin order for your brain and\nbody to function correctly.\nLMNT was designed to\nget you the proper ratio\nof electrolytes in order to optimize\nmental and physical performance.\nPeople out there with\npre-hypertension and hypertension,\nof course, should be cautious\nabout increasing their sodium intake.\nBut many people can actually benefit\nfrom increasing their sodium intake,\nboth for health and for performance.\nLMNT contains a science-backed\nelectrolyte ratio\nof 1000 milligrams.\nThat's one gram of sodium,\n200 milligrams of potassium,\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nI consume LMNT when I first\nwake up in the morning,\nduring exercise, and after exercise,\nand sometimes again, if I've\nbeen sweating profusely,\nfor instance, after doing a sauna\nor taking a run on a hot\nday, things of that sort.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's lmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free LMNT sample pack.\nYou only cover the cost of shipping.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt, lmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free sample pack.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand longterm health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThere are a lot of blood\nand DNA tests out there,\nbut a major issue with many of them\nis that you get numbers back\nabout levels of hormones,\nmetabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker has solved that problem\nby creating a personalized dashboard.\nSo you take your blood\nand or your DNA test,\nyou get the results back,\nand where certain values\nmight be too high or too low\nfor your preference you can click on that,\nand it will direct you\nimmediately to lifestyle factors,\nnutrition, and supplementation, et cetera,\nthat can help you bring those\nnumbers back into the ranges\nthat are ideal for you.\nSo it not only gives you information\nabout where your health stands,\nit gives you directives as to\nhow to improve your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\ngo to

and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nstudying the visual system,\nand I can tell you that your visual system\nis incredibly sophisticated.\nIt allows you to do things like\nmove from a shady area outside\nto a sunny area outside\nand to adjust your visual system\nso you don't even notice that transition.\nA lot of sunglasses and\neyeglasses are not designed\nwith those sorts of biological\ntransitions in mind.\nROKA sunglasses and\neyeglasses are different.\nEvery one of their glasses is designed\nwith the biology of the\nvisual system in mind.\nFirst of all, they're\nincredibly lightweight,\nso you don't even notice\nthat they're on your face.\nSecond of all,\nthey were designed to be\nworn during activities\nlike running and cycling, et cetera,\nand they won't slip off your\nface even if you get sweaty.\nAnd they have a terrific aesthetic.\nSo even though they\nwere originally designed\nas active eyewear, they look great.\nSo you can wear them out to dinner,\nto school, at work, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nsunglasses or eyeglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's roka.com,\nand enter the code Huberman to\nsave 20% on

health benefits and tools\nrelated to heat and heating.\nThe first question that we have to answer\nis how do we heat up?\nAnd the answer to that question\nis we heat up two ways.\nWe heat up from the outside,\nmeaning the things that\nwe come into contact with,\nthe clothing that we put on our body,\nwhether or not there's heat in the room,\nor whether or not it's cold\noutside or cold in a room,\nand we heat up from the inside.\nOur body has the capacity\nto generate more heat\nor to cool down, meaning to\nturn off the heating process,\nand it can do that in ways\nthat match the external environment.\nThe simplest way to think about this\nis that we actually have\ntwo body temperatures.\nPeople will say, \"Oh,\nwhat's body temperature?\n\"98.6.\"\nThat's actually not true.\nBody temperature varies\nbetween individuals.\nIt varies across time of\nday within individuals.\nAnd at every point across\nyour entire lifespan,\nyou have two distinct temperatures.\nOne is the temperature on your skin,\nwhat scientists call your shell,\nand the temperature of your core,\nyour viscera, meaning your organs,\nyour nervous system, and your spinal cord.\nAnd as you can imagine,\nthe temperature of your core\nis always higher than the\ntemperature at your surface.\nSo the important thing to know\nis that you have a\ntemperature at your shell\nand a temperature at your core.\nNow you don't need to know exactly\nwhat those temperatures are in most cases,\nbut it is vitally important to understand\nthat you have those two temperatures\nand that your brain is constantly\nsending out signals to your body\nas to whether or not it\nshould heat up or cool down,\ndepending on the temperature of the shell,\nwhich makes total sense.\nThis is a lot like a thermostat in a room,\nwhich is essentially paying attention\nto how cold or hot it is,\nand then sending signals to\nthe heating or cooling system\nto either heat up the environment\nor cool down the environment,\ndepending on the temperature\nin that environment.\nYour brain has neurons that send signals\nto other cells in your body\nand deploy the release of\nchemicals in your brain and body\nto heat you up when you are too cold\nand to cool you down when you are too hot.\nSo, if you can understand\nthat you have two body temperatures,\none at your shell, the surface,\nand one at your core, inside,\nand that your body and\nbrain are always trying\nto balance those two temperatures\nin the appropriate way,\nwell then you're halfway there\nto understanding the biology\nof thermal regulation and heating,\nand you'll be a lot further along\nin understanding how\nspecific tools can be used\nto improve metabolism or\nimprove cognition, for instance.\nIn fact, later you will learn\nthat one way that you can heat up\nis by cooling down the\nsurface of your body.\nThat's right.\nIf I were to throw a cold\ntowel, ice cold towel,\nonto your torso right now and ask you,\n\"Well, how do you feel?\"\nYou'd say, \"Oh, that's\ncold, that's chilly.\"\nHowever, because your brain is acting like\na bit of a thermostat as the surface,\nthe shell of your body felt cool,\nit would make sense that that thermostat\nwould activate biological mechanisms\nthat would heat up your core.\nSimilarly, if I were to put you\ninto a very hot environment,\nyou'd say, \"Oh, wow, it's\nreally, really warm in here,\"\nbut your brain and your body would go\nthrough a lot of effort\nto activate mechanisms\nto cool you down.\nSo anytime we're talking about heat,\nmeaning deliberate heat\nexposure, things like sauna,\nit's very important to\nunderstand, not just the stimulus,\nhow hot something is, how long\nyou're in a sauna, et cetera,\nbut the effect that has on\nyour shell and on your core.\nIf you can understand that\nyou can design protocols\nthat are literally perfect for your goals.\nAnd as a final point about this,\nif you want to develop the best tools,\nleveraging heat for your biology\nand health and performance,\nyou want to understand heat as a process,\nas a verb, as heating, not just heat,\nbecause there's the\ntemperature that you are at\nbefore you encounter the heat stimulus,\nbefore you get in the sauna, for instance,\nduring the heat stimulus, so\nwhile you're in the sauna,\nand then afterward.\nEverything in biology is a process.\nSo as you'll soon learn,\nthere is a specific sauna\nprotocol that can allow you,\ncan allow anybody, in fact,\nto increase the amount of growth hormone\nreleased into their\nbrain and body 16 fold.\nThat's right, 16 fold.\nHowever, it involves shifting\nfrom a hot environment\nto a cool environment,\nto a hot environment,\nto a cool environment, over\nand over and over again,\nover a very short period of time,\nbecause it engages a switch, a process,\nthat compounds, it builds on itself,\nto increase growth hormone\nfurther and further.\nIn fact, if you were to\njust get into a sauna\nfor a very long period of time\nand crank up the temperature\nto match the exact temperature\nthat was used in that study,\nyou would not experience those\nincreases in growth hormone.\nIt really is the transition\nbetween hot and cool temperatures\nthat engage the process of heating\nand reheating over and over again.\nSo, today you're going to\nlearn about the use of sauna.\nYou're going to learn about the\nuse of other heat-related tools\nfor health and optimization,\nnot just for growth hormone,\nbut also metabolic health,\nfor controlling cortisol,\neven to impact mental\nhealth in positive ways.\nAnd in order to do that,\nyou need to understand a\nlittle bit about the mechanisms\nof how you heat up and how you cool down,\nwhere the cells and circuits\nare in the brain and body,\nhow those cells and circuits work.\nI promise to make the description of that\nwhich follows very clear,\neven if you don't have\na background in biology.\nAnd once you have that in hand,\nalong with the understanding you now have\nabout the fact that you\ngot a shell and a core,\nand you need to think about\nboth the shell and the core,\nwell, then you will be in\nthe best possible position\nto use sauna or hot tub or other tools,\neven just a hot shower,\nas a powerful stimulus\nto optimize your biology.\nNow, the science of heat and heating\nand cold and cooling, for that matter,\ngoes back well over a hundred years.\nIn fact, it's kind of amusing to me\nthat nowadays there's a\nkind of renewed interest\nin the use of heat and cold\nand the science of heat and cold,\nbecause this was the\nfirst topic that I studied\nas an undergraduate.\nAnd in fact, I did my graduate\nthesis on thermal regulation.\nAnd at the time, thermal\nregulation wasn't really considered\none of the hot topics in neuroscience.\nPeople were more focused on things\nlike memory and consciousness.\nAnd of course those topics\nare still of vital interest\nto many people in many laboratories,\nbut thermal regulation was considered\nmore a thing for the physiologists.\nNowadays, not just on social media,\nnot just in the landscape\nof biohackers and athletes,\nbut in the landscape of\nmental health, and frankly,\nin the general ethos\naround health optimization,\npeople are really\ninterested in heat and cold.\nAnd the reason they're so\ninterested in heat and cold\nis that a lot of the science has been done\nboth in animal models\nin mice and in humans\nand translates immediately to\nprotocols that anyone can use.\nNow, a brief warning now and\nanother brief warning later,\nanytime you're talking\nabout heating up your body,\nyou need to be very cautious,\nbecause unlike cooling down,\nwhere you have a fairly broad\nrange of cold temperatures\nthat you can go into before\nit's damaging to tissue,\nwell, you don't get to heat up\nthe brain and body very much\nbefore you start getting into\nthe realm of neuron damage,\nand neuron's in the\ncentral nervous system,\nthe brain and spinal cord,\nonce they're damaged they don't come back.\nSo hyperthermia is a\nserious thing to avoid.\nLater I'll talk about ways\nto rapidly protect against hyperthermia,\nbut I do want to give everybody\na cautionary note up front.\nObviously, if you're pregnant, nursing,\nif you're very sensitive\nto hot environments,\nyou want to stay out of saunas\nand things of that sort.\nI'm sure there are exceptions to that.\nYou definitely have to talk to your doctor\nif you're going to violate that rule.\nAnd for everybody, you want to approach\nany kind of tool related\nto heating very cautiously.\nYou always have the opportunity\nto increase the temperature later.\nSo proceed with caution.\nBe smart about it.\nI don't just say of that to protect me.\nI say that also to protect you.\nSo now let's talk about\nwhat are the circuits for heating up?\nHow does that happen?\nMany of you have probably\nexperienced a fever.\nHow does that happen?\nWhat happens when you go\ninto a cold environment\nand you're shivering,\nbut you put on a coat\nand then you feel warmer.\nWhat's really going on there?\nWell, there's a very basic circuit,\nmeaning neurons that exist in the skin,\nin the brain, and in the body\nthat communicate with one\nanother that allow you\nto heat up if you need to\nand cool down if you need to.\nI'm going to throw a\nlittle bit of nomenclature,\na few new words at you.\nYou don't need to memorize\nthese words, except for one,\nactually you need to memorize one acronym,\nbut it's very easy.\nIt's called the POA.\nIf you remember POA,\nyou'll be home free for\nthe rest of the episode,\nbut I know that there are\nsome aficionados out there\nand people interested in getting\na little bit deeper mechanism.\nAnd I do think it's important\nto understand the circuit,\nbecause once you stand this circuit\nand the way it's structured,\nthen you are going to be in a\ngreat position to use the tools\nrelated to heating.\nSo here's how this circuit is structured.\nYou have this shell,\nwhich is basically skin,\nand within the skin you\nhave neurons, nerve cells.\nThose nerve cells have\nchannels or receptors on them.\nThey're called trip channels.\nThere's some other ones as well,\nwhich basically sense changes in heat.\nSo if I were to put a hot\nobject on your hand or your arm,\nor for instance,\nif I were to put a hot\nobject on your hand or arm,\nand then remove that hot object,\nthose neurons would respond to that.\nThey would send electrical\nsignals into your spinal cord.\nAnd that's where the next\nstation of the circuit resides.\nIn your spinal cord you got\na little cluster of neurons\nthat exists at the top\npart of your spinal cord\ncalled the dorsal horn.\nThe name, again, doesn't matter.\nAnd those neurons specifically\nrelay heat information\nup to another area of your brain.\nNow here's where we get\ninto some fancy names.\nIt's the lateral parabrachial area.\nYou don't need to know\nlateral parabrachial area,\nbut it's a relay station.\nThe lateral parabrachial area\nsends electrical signals to the POA.\nAnd I would like you to know POA.\nThe POA stands for preoptic area.\nNeurons in the preoptic area\nbasically reside over\nthe roof of your mouth.\nThese are neurons within the hypothalamus,\nand neurons in the preoptic area\nhave the ability to send signals\nout to the rest of your brain and body\nto get you to heat up and\nactually to change your behavior\nso that you heat up.\nThat's right.\nIf neurons in the preoptic area\nreceive an electrical signal\nthrough the circuit I just described,\nthat goes from skin to dorsal\nhorn of the spinal cord,\nto lateral parabrachial,\nthey will start sending signals\nout to the organs of your body\nand the tissues of your body\nto get those organs and\ntissues to do things.\nAnd believe it or not, your\nPOA, your preoptic area,\nwill actually change the way\nthat you think and feel immediately.\nFor instance, if something\nwarm contacts your skin,\nor something very hot contacts your skin,\nthe preoptic area will send signals\nout to the endothelial cells,\nthe blood vessels both\nof the brain and body\nthat get them to dilate,\nto essentially increase their\nvolume and their surface area\nin order to cast off heat.\nYou will also start sweating.\nThat sweating response is initiated,\nnot by the hot day or the hot sun,\nbut by the preoptic area neurons\nthat send signals out to what's called\nthe periphery of your\nand other chemicals are released,\nthings like acetylcholine,\nthat get you to sweat.\nAnd if you happen to be shivering,\nneurons in the preoptic area\nwill make sure that you stop shivering.\nYou're probably familiar with the feeling\nof being somewhat lethargic,\nor spreading out your limbs on a hot day.\nWell, that is the result of\nneurons in your preoptic area\nimpacting your musculature\nto get you to increase your surface area\nso you can sweat off or release more heat.\nSo there are all these\ndifferent mechanisms\nby which we dump heat.\nSome of those are purely physiological,\nbelow our conscious control,\nthings like sweating,\nwhich you can't just make\nyourself sweat on demand.\nMaybe you can through a\nset of stressful thoughts,\nbut you can't just make yourself sweat.\nThat is autonomic, it's\nbelow your conscious control.\nThings like vasodilation,\nthe dilation of your veins in particular\nand capillaries in particular.\nThese sorts of things.\nAnd, of course, there\nare these behavioral,\nsomewhat voluntary\naspects of dumping heat.\nAnd the lethargy, the kind\nof tiredness that we feel\non a really hot day,\nthat's also controlled by the circuit\nthat I just described.\nIn fact, I just got back from\na visit to a very warm place,\nand it was remarkable to\nme how lethargic I felt\nin the afternoons.\nI just felt like a total slug.\nI just could not move\nor rally to do anything,\nexcept if I waited until the evening,\neven though it was later in the day,\neven though I hadn't napped,\nas the temperature in my\nenvironment cooled off,\nas my body temperature cooled off,\nI felt like I had more energy.\nI was actually waking up,\neven though I had been awake for longer.\nSo the relationship between\ntemperature and lethargy\nis a very intimate one.\nIf we're warm enough, we feel active\nand like we want to move around.\nIf we're too warm,\nwe feel like we need to stay put\nand spread out our limbs and dump heat.\nAnd that brings me to a\nquick and kind of fun point\nabout how we dump heat versus\nhow other animals dump heat.\nMany of you know, of course,\nthat we dump heat by sweating.\nOther mechanisms as well,\nsome of which I described,\nbut that's our main way of dumping heat.\nOther animals like dogs don't\nhave the capacity to sweat,\nat least not very much,\nso they pant in order to dump heat.\nAnd still other animals, like rodents,\nwhen they get too hot\nthey spit on their paws\nand they rub that spit on\nthe surface of their body,\nwhich might sound kind of gross,\nand probably will get you to think twice\nbefore petting any of those animals\nor holding any of those animals again,\nunless that's your thing.\nNow, one other key thing to understand\nabout this circuit related to heat\nis that the preoptic area\nalso can send electrical\nsignals to the amygdala,\na brain area that is often talked about\nin the context of fear,\nbut is really just a brain area\nthat can activate your\nsympathetic nervous system.\nThe sympathetic nervous system\nis part of your autonomic nervous system\nand is the one associated\nwith fight or flight,\nor with the stress response,\nor even just the excited response.\nThe sympathetic nervous system\nis also what gets activated\nwhen you're really\nexcited about something.\nThe preoptic area has the opportunity\nto trigger the activation of the amygdala.\nNow, it doesn't do it\nevery time, but it can.\nAnd it tends to do that\nwhen you are suddenly\nin an environment that feels too hot,\nthat you feel is risky levels of hot.\nIf you ever have gotten into a sauna\nthat was very, very hot,\nmaybe 210 degrees Fahrenheit,\nyou sit there for a minute.\nYou'll notice that your\nheart rate increases,\nand there are reasons for that,\nand we'll talk about some of\nthe health benefits of that\nin a few minutes, but\nit's pretty uncomfortable.\nYou may not feel like your\nskin is going to burn up,\nbut you often will feel\nthe impulse to get out,\nespecially if you stay in\nthere for a little while.\nThat impulse is the consequence\nof this preoptic area\ncommunicating with your amygdala saying,\n\"Hey, this environment is really hot,\nand I'm tryin' to cool down,\nand it's not really working.\nI'm dumping heat, but\nI'm not able to adjust\nthe core of my body temperature\nin ways that are going\nto protect my neurons.\nAnd so it's a signal that you probably\nshouldn't stay in that\nenvironment too long.\nNow later we'll talk about the advantage\nof pushing yourself a little bit through\nsome of these very hot environments,\nprovided you can do it safely,\nbut the impulse to get yourself\nout of a very hot environment\nis the consequence of the POA\ncommunicating with your amygdala,\nand the amygdala then, in turn,\nactivating your adrenal glands,\nwhich sit right above your kidneys,\nthe release of adrenaline,\nand this feeling of agitation\nlike you want to move.\nUsually you want to move out\nof whatever hot environment\nyou happen to be in.\nSo now you know the circuit.\nAgain, it's simple.\nIt goes from skin to spinal cord,\none brain area to another brain area.\nThat's the key one in this discussion,\nwhich is the POA, the preoptic area.\nAnd then the preop area can kick off\na bunch of autonomic\nsubconscious responses to heat,\nwhich make us attempt to get cooler,\nthings like sweating,\nvasodilation, et cetera,\nand it can kick off behavioral responses,\nspreading out our limbs in an attempt\nto dump even more heat;\nfeeling lethargic, so a lack\nof desire to run and move;\nand it also has the\nopportunity to kick off\na mild, or maybe not so mild,\npanic response to get us\nout of that hot environment.\nIf you can conceptualize that circuit,\nor if you can even just\nunderstand what I just said,\neven at a top contour level,\nyou're going to be in a great position\nto understand the rest of the information\nand the tools that follow.\nNext, I'd like to talk about the use\nof deliberate heat\nexposure, including sauna,\nbut other tools as well,\nas a way to understand how heat\nand heating changes our biology.\nSo, you're going to learn some mechanism\nand you're going to learn some tools.\nBut first I'd like to just emphasize\nthat the use of deliberate heat exposure\ncan be a very powerful way to\nimprove health and longevity.\nThere's a wonderful study on this\nthat was published in 2018 that includes\na lot of data from a lot of participants,\nin a lot of different conditions,\nfor instance, people\nthat only did sauna once\nversus two to three times a week\nversus four to seven\ntimes a week and so on,\nand compares all those.\nThe title of the study is\nSauna Bathing is Associated\nWith Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality\nand Improves Risk\nPrediction in Men and Women\na Prospective Cohort Study.\nThis is one of several papers\nthat clearly demonstrate\nthat regular use of sauna or other forms\nof deliberate heat exposure\ncan reduce mortality to\ncardiovascular events,\nbut also to other events,\nthings like stroke and other things\nthat basically can kill us.\nWhat I like so much about\nthis and the related studies,\nand yes, I will provide a link\nto these in the show notes,\nis that they involve\na lot of participants.\nSo for instance, in this particular paper,\nwhich was published in BMC Medicine,\nthey looked at a sample\nof 1,688 participants\nwho had a mean age of 63,\nbut there was a range of ages around 63,\nand of whom 51.4% were women.\nThe rest were men.\nSo it's a pretty nicely varied study\nin terms of the populations\nthat they looked at.\nAnd basically what they found\nwas the more often that people do sauna,\nthe better their health is\nand the lower the likelihood they will die\nfrom some sort of cardiovascular event.\nWhat do we mean by sauna?\nWe need to define some of\nthe parameters around sauna,\nand I promise to provide\nyou some alternative ways\nto access some of the health benefits\nthat were observed in\nthis and related studies\nwithout the need to have a sauna,\n'cause I do realize that a lot of people\ndon't have access to sauna.\nFirst off, the temperature\nranges that were used\nin this and pretty much all the studies\nthat I'm going to talk about,\nunless I say otherwise, are\nbetween 80 degrees Celsius,\nmeaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand 100 degrees Celsius,\nmeaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSo somewhere in that range.\nHow hot should you make the\nsauna or the environment\nthat you get into should you\ndecide to use these tools?\nWell, that will depend on\nyour tolerance for heat,\nhow heat adapted you are.\nYes, some people are better\nat sweating than others.\nAnd over time we all\nget better at sweating.\nMeaning if you go into\nthe sauna more frequently,\nyou become a better sweater,\nnot sweater you wear,\nbut the verb sweater,\nyou get better at sweating,\nat dumping heat through the loss of water.\nSo it's going to depend.\nI recommend starting on the lower end\nof the temperature scale,\nand if that's too hot for you\nthat you even lower the\ntemperature further.\nNow, how long were people\nexposing themselves\nto these hot environments?\nAnywhere from five to\n20 minutes per session.\nAnd as you'll soon learn,\nvery brief periods of just\nfive minutes of heat exposure\ncan be a powerful stimulus\nif the heat exposure is\nsignificantly great enough for you.\n20 minutes can also be beneficial,\nbut 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,\nmeaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit\nto 212 degrees Fahrenheit\nis the general range that\nthis and most studies use.\nIn this particular study,\nthey compared the effects of people\nthat did sauna once a week,\ntwo or three times per week,\nor four to seven times per week.\nAnd what they saw was really remarkable.\nWhat they observed was that people\nwho went into the sauna\ntwo or three times per week\nwere 27% less likely to die\nof a cardiovascular event\nthan people that went into\nthe sauna just once a week,\nagain at the temperature levels\nand the duration that\nI talked about earlier.\nAnd as you can imagine, the duration,\nthe temperature levels were related.\nSo if people went into\nvery hot environments\nthat were really uncomfortable for them,\nmaybe they only went in for five minutes.\nWhereas, if they were more\ncomfortable and heat adapted\nin a given environment or\ntheir tolerance for heat\nwas just simply higher\nfor whatever reason,\nwell then they tended to stay in longer.\nWe can take a sort of average\nof this five to 20 minute range,\nand today we're mainly going\nto talk about exposures\nbetween 10 and 20 minutes\nat temperatures between,\nagain, 80 degrees and 100 degrees Celsius,\n176 degrees Fahrenheit,\nor 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSo these data point to the\nfact that going in the sauna\ntwo or three times per\nweek is really beneficial\nand can lower mortality\nto cardiovascular events.\nAnd in fact, the benefits\nwere even greater\nfor people that we're going into the sauna\nfour to seven times per week.\nThose people were 50% less likely to die\nof a cardiovascular event\ncompared to people that\nwent into the sauna\njust once a week.\nSo these are really\nimpressive, and frankly,\nencouraging studies.\nCertainly they caught\nmy eye and encouraged me\nto start using deliberate heat\nexposure on a regular basis.\nWhat's particularly nice about this study,\nand the related study that, again,\nis linked in the show notes,\nis that they looked at a number\nof potentially confounding variables,\nthings like whether or not people smoked,\nthings like whether or not\npeople were overweight,\nwhether or not they tended\nto exercise or not exercise,\nand they were able to\nseparate out those variables.\nSo the percentages that\nI described earlier,\n27% less likely to die\nof a cardiovascular event\nfor those that went in the\nsauna two to three times a week\nand 50% less likely to die\nof a cardiovascular event\nfor those that went into the\nsauna four times per week,\nas compared to just once a week.\nThose effects really do seem to be\nthe consequence of the sauna exposure\nand not some other effect\nthat's correlated with sauna exposure,\nlike going to the gym where people\nare working out seven times a week\nand then also happen\nto get into the sauna,\nor quitting smoking\nright about the same time\nthey adopt a sauna protocol,\nthese sorts of things.\nAnd now there have been\nadditional analyses\nof the use of sauna for improving health,\nor I should say for offsetting mortality,\nthat have found that\nit's not just reductions\nin cardiovascular events,\nbut so called all-cause mortality.\nThis is kind of medical\ngeek speak for saying,\nhow likely are you or somebody to die\nfrom a cardiovascular event,\nbut maybe be also from some other event,\nsome other health-related event,\nlike cancer or something of that sort.\nAnd in every case,\nregular exposure to sauna starting\nat about two or three times per week,\nall the way up to seven times per week,\ngreatly improves,\nmeaning statistically significant\nimprovements in longevity\nin the sense that people are less likely\nto die of cardiovascular events\nand other things that kill us.\nSo I and many other people\nwho are interested not\njust in our own health,\nbut in educating about\nhealth-related tools\nto the general public,\nfind this really exciting.\nBut knowing what we know about\nhow heat impacts our biology,\nit probably shouldn't surprise us\nthat this sauna type exposure\nor deliberate heat exposure\nhas these incredible effects.\nSo before we get into\nthe biological mechanisms\nof how heat can have all these\nimpressive health effects,\nI want to just talk about\nthe use of sauna as a tool\nand emphasize that you\ndon't have to use a sauna\nin order to get these benefits.\nIt is simply a matter of\nmaking sure that your shell\nand your core heat up properly a bit,\nnot too much, not too little,\nbut that you heat those up.\nAnd no, you do not need to\ncarry a thermometer around\nor place a thermometer into your core.\nIn laboratory studies and in humans,\nif you really want to know\nsomeone's core temperature,\nbasically you try and\nput the thermal probe\nas close to the core as you can.\nSo typically that's done\nrectally or a mouth thermometer\nor even up the nose.\nYou don't need to do any of that.\nThis isn't a laboratory study.\nThere are ways to create a hot environment\nsuch that you heat up your\nshell and your core safely\nwithout having to measure your\ncore temperature all along.\nIf you want to do that, be my guess,\nbut I'm not going to provide a protocol.\nSo the question is, how are you\nheating up your environment?\nAnd I realize that there are dry saunas,\nthere are steam saunas,\nthere are infrared saunas,\nthere are hot tubs,\nand there are simply rooms\nthat you crank up the heat.\nThere are also ways in which you can\nincrease your shell and\nyour core temperature\nby moving around a lot\nand doing that wearing a lot of clothing.\nThere's nothing special about\nany one of these approaches or protocols.\nIt just so happens that sauna\nis one of the more\nconvenient ways to do this.\nAnd certainly for the studies\nthat I've talked about,\nnot just the ones I referenced before,\nbut all the studies that I researched\nlooking at this episode,\nit makes sense why they would use sauna,\nbecause it's very hard, for instance,\nto create conditions where you have\nfive people go out jogging,\nwearing heavy sweaters and hats,\nwool hats on the middle of summer,\nit's very hard to set up those conditions\nin a way that's controlled for everybody.\nWhereas, it's pretty straightforward\nto have a sauna where you have\none or several people just get into\nthat one uniformly hot environment.\nThat's a much easier study to run.\nSo just to be clear, the\ntemperature range is important.\nYou want to get between 80\nand 100 degrees Celsius.\nNow you know the conversion to Fahrenheit.\nYou could, however, immerse yourself\nin a hot tub or hot water\nbath up to your neck.\nThat's another way to approach it.\nIf you didn't have access\nto either of those,\nyou could also put on a hoodie\nor a wool hat and a hoodie,\nor you could do like the wrestlers do,\nand you could actually buy\none of these plastic suits.\nThey're literally called plastics\nthat wrestlers or other athletes\nthat wish to drop water weight will wear,\nand then go jogging in that.\nAll of those will increase your shell\nand your core body temperature.\nEspecially if you do it on a hot day,\nbut of course be careful,\nhydrate and don't overheat.\nDon't become excessively hyperthermic,\n'cause you can get heat stroke\nand you can potentially die.\nBut if you're going to use sauna,\noften I get the question\nhow hot should the sauna be?\nWell now you know.\nHow long should you be in there?\nFive to 20 minutes per session.\nAlthough, I will talk\nin a minute about ways\nto optimize hormone output,\nin particular growth hormone output,\nby doing four very brief sessions.\nSo maybe not a continuous session.\nWe'll get into that in a few minutes.\nAnd, of course, you have to ask yourself\nwet sauna, dry sauna.\nYou know what?\nDoesn't matter.\nUse what you prefer.\nMany people ask me, \"Well,\nwhat about infrared sauna?\"\nWe have an entire episode\nall about the use of light\nand low level light therapy,\nincluding infrared light.\nIt does have certain benefits for skin\nand other organs and tissues\nof the body, if used properly.\nMy understanding, or\nat least my assessment,\nof most infrared saunas out there\nis that they don't get hot enough.\nThey don't get up to that 80\nto 100 degrees Celsius range.\nSome do, most don't.\nSo what you end up with is a situation\nwhere you've got a red light,\nlow level light therapy stimulus,\nand you've got a sauna\nthat's not quite hot enough.\nAnd there are a lot of ideas and claims\nabout how they work together\nin order to get you improved benefits.\nI personally am of the stance,\nbased on the literature that I've read,\nthat you want to get into those ranges\nof 80 to 100 degrees Celsius\nbefore you start\nconsidering whether or not\nyou're also going to include\nred light therapies, et cetera.\nSo there's nothing special\nabout red light sauna.\nIt's really the temperature of the sauna\nthat you happen to get into.\nSo which tool?\nWhich sauna?\nWhich stimulus?\nDo you run wearing plastics\nand a hoodie and a wool hat\nor do you get into a sauna?\nThat's going to depend a\nlot on your circumstances,\nyour budget, and what you have\naccess to on a regular basis.\nThis is a lot like our\ndiscussion about the use of cold.\nMost of the studies have looked\nat immersion in cold water\nup to the neck,\nbecause that's a very controlled situation\nthat you can do in a laboratory.\nThey have not explored\ncold showers as much,\nSo there's just less data,\nor walking around in a cold environment.\nBut we'll talk a little\nbit about those data,\nbecause as you'll soon learn,\nwhen you talk about cold,\nyou're actually talking\nabout heating as well.\nSo what kind of mechanisms are activated\nin your brain and body\nthat allow for the various health benefits\nof sauna or other forms\nof deliberate heating?\nWell, we talked about reduced risk\nof cardiovascular event related mortality\nand all-cause mortality.\nAs you'll soon learn,\nthere are also tremendous benefits\nin terms of increases in growth hormone,\nreductions in cortisol, et cetera.\nI will detail those.\nSo what happens when you do\nget into a hot environment?\nWhat are the mechanisms\nthat allow for the various\nhealth effects of that?\nWell, your shell, your skin, senses that.\nAnd through the circuit\nthat I described earlier,\nactivates neurons in the\nPOA, the preoptic area,\nwhich in turn activates mechanisms\nin your autonomic nervous\nsystem, like vasodilation.\nSo blood flow increases.\nPlasma volume of your blood increases,\nand stroke volume.\nThe volume of blood that is mobilized\nwith each beat of your\nheart also increases.\nAnd your heart rate increases\nto anywhere between 100\nto 150 beats per minute.\nThat general constellation of effects\nlooks a lot like cardiovascular exercise.\nAnd in fact, for all intents and purposes,\nit really is cardiovascular exercise,\nexcept that there isn't the mobilization\nand the loading of joints and\nlimbs and things of that sort.\nAnd of course there\nare additional benefits\nof cardiovascular exercise\nthat relate to impact on the ground,\nimprovements in bone density,\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut basically your heart starts beating,\nmore blood starts circulating,\nyour vasculature changes shape, literally,\nto accommodate those increases\nin heart rate and blood volume.\nAnd you're basically getting\na cardiovascular workout\nin that hot environment, even\nif you're just sitting down.\nAnother set of positive effects\nrelated to being in these hot environments\nare hormone effects,\nshifts in the output of hormones,\nboth from or your adrenals\nand possibly from the testes and ovaries\nand even within the brain.\nOne of the more striking examples of that\ncomes from a study that\nwas published in 2021.\nThe title of the study is\n\"Endocrine Effects of\nRepeated Hot Thermal Stress\n\"and Cold Water Immersion\nin Young Adult Men.\"\nAnd indeed, this study was, in\nthis case, just done on men.\nI'll just briefly describe\nthe protocol they used.\nThey had these men attend\nfour sauna sessions\nof 12 minutes each.\nSo again, well within that\nrange of five to 20 minutes,\n12 minutes.\nThe temperature of those saunas\nwas 90 to 91 degrees Celsius.\nSo I'll just quickly do the calculation,\nadmittedly, not in my head.\nThat's 194 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand they did that four times.\nAfterwards they had a\nsix-minute cool down break\nduring which they did\nget into some cool water\nor cold water of about\n10 degrees, which is,\n10 degrees Celsius is\n50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAnd then they measured\nhormones at various times\nthroughout this study,\nbefore, during, and after.\nThey looked at testosterone,\nthey looked at DHEA, which\nis in the androgen pathway.\nThey looked at prolactin\nand they looked at cortisol.\nThe significant effects of the protocol\nthat I just described were on cortisol,\na so-called stress hormone.\nSo-called because when\nwe are very stressed\nfor long periods of time,\ncortisol levels tend to\nincrease dramatically.\nBut I should point out that a\nincrease in cortisol each day\nright about the time of waking,\nand specifically right\nabout the time of waking,\nis actually beneficial for\nour alertness and our energy.\nSo having some increasing\ncortisol every 24 hours\nis a good thing, provided\nit happens early in the day.\nLate day increases in cortisol\nare associated with depression.\nThat's been shown by studies\nat Stanford and elsewhere.\nThe major effect of this study\nis a significant decrease\nin cortisol output\nin these subjects.\nI think this is really\ninteresting and important,\nbecause many people suffer from acute,\nmeaning immediate, and longterm stress,\nand are looking for ways\nto control their stress.\nControlling your cortisol is tricky.\nIn the episode on stress,\nI talked about supplements\nsuch ashwagandha\nthat can be used to limit cortisol,\nbut you have to be careful\nnot to use ashwagandha\nfor extended periods of time,\nmeaning for longer than two weeks,\nbecause you can get into other issues.\nI talk about breath work protocols\nthat can allow you to clamp or reduce\nthe stress response in real time.\nAgain, see that episode for those,\nbut many people are overworked.\nThey're overstressed.\nThey're, for one reason or another,\nthey're subjected to\nmany too many stressors\nor their level of stress\nresilience isn't high enough\nto keep their cortisol levels\nclamped at a healthy level.\nSo the protocol I described\nof 12 minute exposures\nto 90 degree environment,\nthat's again, 90 degree Celsius,\nfollowed by a six-minute cool down break\nin cool water, 50 degrees\nor so, that's pretty cold.\nI can imagine that you could\nalso just take a cool shower\nor a cold shower afterwards,\nthat had a very significant\neffect on lowering cortisol.\nSo there you have a tool\nthat's not a completely zero cost tool,\n'cause you need to heat the water\nand you need to have access\nto hot and cold water,\nat least hot and cold\ncontrast of some sort,\nbut it's fairly minimal\ncost for most people.\nEspecially if you start getting creative\nabout maybe taking a 12-minute jog\nwearing a lot of clothing if it's hot out,\nthen getting into a cool shower.\nYou might not get the same extreme\nor significant reduction in cortisol\nthat was observed here with\nthese very specific protocols,\nbut it's likely that you would get\na similar result over all.\nNow, I mentioned they did\nlook at these other hormones,\nand I'll just tell you\nthat they did not see significant\nshifts in testosterone,\nprolactin, DHEA, et cetera,\nusing this protocol.\nAs you'll soon see, there\nare other sauna protocols\nthat can impact those other hormones.\nSo if you're seeking to\nuse sauna to reduce stress,\nI think this is a very interesting\nand potentially useful\nresearch-backed protocol.\nAnd again, we will provide\na link to the paper\nif you'd like to read more about the data.\nSo that is one set of\nbiological effects on cortisol\nand the related protocol.\nWhat about some of the\nother benefits of sauna?\nWell, we'll talk about those,\nbut I want to talk about\nthose in the context\nof the underlying mechanisms,\nbecause if you understand\nthose underlying mechanisms,\nyou can really tailor your sauna protocols\nfor your particular needs.\nOne of the more dramatic\nand important effects\nof going into a hot environment\nfor some period of time\nis the activation of so-called\nheat shock proteins, or HSPs.\nHeat shock proteins are\na protective mechanism\nin your brain and body to rescue proteins\nthat would otherwise misfold.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nWell, most of you're\nfamiliar with the fact that\nif you have protein in the kitchen,\nlike a steak or a piece of\nchicken or a piece of fish,\nand you heat it up, it\nchanges it's texture.\nRaw meat is different than cooked meat,\nto be quite blunt about it.\nHeat changes the quality of proteins,\nnot just in terms of how they taste,\nbut the way in which they are configured.\nIt changes it right down\nat the molecular level.\nWhen your body goes through\nchanges in temperature each day,\nand we'll talk about those changes,\nbut in response to hot\nenvironments or cold environments,\nheat shock proteins are\ndeployed to go and rescue\nand prevent the changes in proteins\nthat would be detrimental to your health.\nSo at least in the short term,\nactivating heat shock\nproteins is a good thing.\nYou don't want heat shock proteins\nto be activated for long periods of time,\nbecause that gets to be\nproblematic for other reasons.\nBut these heat shock proteins,\nof which there are many varieties,\nbasically have the job of\ntraveling in your brain and body\nand making sure that cells\nthat contain proteins that are misfolding\nbecause they got heated up\ntoo much, don't misfold,\nand they also, sort of\na protective mechanism,\nmaking sure that proteins within the cells\nof your brain and body don't\nfold in the wrong ways.\nAgain, I'm describing this\nin very general terms,\nbut it's well established in\nanimal models and in humans,\nthat sauna exposure of the\nsort that I described earlier\nactivates these heat shock proteins.\nThere's some interesting\nstudies that were carried out\nin animal models that really nicely\nmechanistically support the\nrole of heat shock proteins\nin some of the benefits of\ndeliberate heat exposure.\nSome of these studies were done in flies,\nmeaning Drosophila, fruit flies,\n'cause there are great model organism,\nbecause you can delete\ngenes or add genes easily.\nOther studies have been done in mice.\nAnd now there are also studies\nbeing carried out in humans,\nand I will talk about those.\nOne of the more dramatic examples\nthat's always touted in this field\nof deliberate heat exposure\nas it relates to longevity\nis that if they expose these\nflies, these fruit flies\nto 70 minutes of a heat\nstimulus that would,\nobviously didn't kill them,\nbut activated heat shock proteins,\nit could extend their life by 15%\nin a heat shock dependent way.\nMeaning if they made flies\nthat didn't have these\nheat shock proteins,\nwell then they didn't see\nthis extension in life.\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nto use model organisms.\nThis is not an experiment\nthat you could do in people.\nHowever, there have been\ninteresting studies done in humans,\nexamining some of the\ndownstream molecular pathways\nof deliberate heat exposure\nthat point to the mechanisms\nby which deliberate heat exposure\ncan help protect against\ndifferent forms of mortality,\nimprove overall, and possibly,\nand I want to highlight possibly,\npossibly extend life.\nOne such mechanism\ninvolves a genetic program\ninvolving a molecule called FOXO3.\nFOXO3 is a very interesting molecule,\nbecause it's involved\nin DNA repair pathways.\nDNA repair is part of the\nprocess of remaining healthy.\nWe'd all like to think that we're born,\nand based on the genes we have,\nwe are healthy, healthy, healthy,\nthen eventually we age and then we die.\nBut from the time we're\nborn, until the time we die,\nthere's a constant repair\nof our proteins in our cells\nin a modification of the genes\nthat are being expressed,\npuberty being the most dramatic example.\nYou see a kid before\npuberty and after puberty,\nlooks like a different kid,\nsounds like a different kid,\nthinks like a different kid.\nIn fact, it basically is\na different human being.\nIt's not just the hormones.\nIt's that hormones\nthemselves have the capacity\nto turn on and turn off certain genes,\nliterally converting\ncertain tissues and cells\nin the brain and body to do\nentirely different things.\nSo it's not just the sprouting\nof new aspects of our biology.\nIt's literally the conversion\nof different brain centers\nfrom one function to another.\nThat's puberty.\nAnd we'll do a whole\nepisode about puberty.\nWe actually did an episode\non sexual development\nthat talks a little bit\nabout those mechanisms.\nBut the point is that\nthroughout our entire lifespan,\ngenes are being turned on,\ngenes are being turned off.\nGenes are being turned on.\nGene are being turned off.\nAnd DNA, the stuff of genes,\ngets damaged in that process.\nFOXO3 sits upstream in a\npathway related to DNA repair,\nand again, clearing of\nthe senescent cells.\nSauna exposure,\nin particular sauna\nexposure two to three times\nor ideally four to seven times per week\nin that 80 to 100 degree Celsius range\nhas been shown to\nupregulate levels of FOXO3.\nFOXO3 in turn upregulates\npathways related to DNA repair\nand clearing out of these\nsenescent or dead cells,\nwhich is known to be important\nfor various aspects of\nmaintaining cognition\nand other aspects of maintaining health.\nSo these are the likely\nbiological mechanisms\nfor the improvements in lifespan,\nor rather, I should say,\nthese are the biological mechanisms\nthat apparently offset some\nof the cardiovascular risk\nand other forms of mortality\nthat were described earlier.\nOne especially interesting\nthing about FOXO3,\nthere are individuals out there\nthat have either\nadditional copies of FOXO3\nor who have versions of\nFOXO3 that are hyperactive,\nso to speak,\nthose people tend to be\n2.7 times more likely\nto live to 100 years of age or longer.\nSo these are people that\nwere just naturally,\nand fortunately for them,\nendowed with more FOXO3,\nmore clearance of senescent cells,\nmore DNA repair, et cetera.\nFor the rest of us, at\nleast to my knowledge,\nI don't have one of these\nhealth-promoting FOXO3 mutations.\nRemember, mutations can be beneficial\nor they can be detrimental.\nThis, if your goal is to live longer,\nis a beneficial mutation.\nIf you don't have these FOXO3 mutations\nthat allow you to be a centenarian\nat 2.7 times high or\nlikelihood than other people,\ndeliberate heat exposure is one way\nthat you can increase FOXO3 activity.\nAt this point in time,\nmeaning when looking at\nthe research out there,\nit isn't clear what the\noptimal sauna protocol\nis going to be, specifically\nto increase FOXO3,\nand that's probably\nbecause there isn't one.\nThere is no sauna protocol\ndesigned specifically to reduce cortisol\nor specifically to increase FOXO3\nor specifically to activate\nheat shock proteins.\nAny deliberate heat exposure\nis likely to impact all\nof those mechanisms.\nAgain, I encourage you to use this guide\nof 80 to 100 degrees Celsius\nas your kind of bookends\nfor what you can tolerate\nand where you want to start\nand eventually transition to\nin terms of deliberate heat exposure.\nAnd I would encourage you to use\nthat five to 20 minutes\nper session for the sauna\nas your rough guide of how\nlong to remain in this sauna.\nNow, there was a study\npublished just this last year\nthat was mainly focused on\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nI detailed this quite extensively\nin the episode on cold.\nThis is the beautiful\nwork of Susanna Søberg.\nAnd that study looked at\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nbut also sauna exposure.\nAnd that study found that 57,\nyes, 57 minutes per week of sauna exposure\nin conjunction with 11\nminutes per week total\nof deliberate cold exposure\nwas the threshold for getting improvements\nin metabolism and increases in brown fat,\nthis very active fat tissue\nthat improves mitochondrial\nfunction and thermogenesis,\nmeaning heating of the body.\nWe'll talk more about brown fat later.\nWhy do I mention this?\nWell, for those of you that are interested\nin increasing metabolism,\nit does seem to be most beneficial\nto do that 11 minutes per\nweek of cold exposure, again,\ndivided up across two or more sessions.\nSo it's not 11 minutes all at once,\nbut shorter sessions,\nand to get 57 minutes minimum per week\nof sauna exposure, again,\nin the temperature ranges\nthat I've talked about here.\nAnd again, it's not 57 minutes\nin the sauna all at once.\nThat's 57 minutes total per\nweek as the minimum threshold.\nSo you might divide that into\nthree sessions of 20 minutes.\nAnd again, I don't think\n57 is the magic number.\nIt could be 60, it could be 64.\nIt probably could be 55.\nRemember your biological systems\nare not counting things\noff minute by minute,\nsecond by second, least not in most cases.\nSo for those of you that are interested\nin improving metabolism,\ncheck out the episode on cold,\nor just take the Søberg\nProtocol, as I call it,\nwhich is 11 minutes total per\nweek of uncomfortably cold,\nbut safe, cold exposure.\nSo uncomfortably cold means\nyou really, really want\nto get out of the shower\nor the ice bath or whatever environment,\nbut you can stay in,\n11 minutes total per week\ndivided across a couple sessions\nand then 57 minutes per week, or so,\nof deliberate heat exposure,\nagain, uncomfortably,\nbut uncomfortably hot, excuse me,\nbut safe to stay in,\nprobably divided up across\nthree or more sessions.\nOkay, so we've talked\nabout the use of sauna\nto decrease cortisol.\nWe've talked about the use of sauna\nto increase heat shock proteins.\nWe've talked about the use of sauna\nto increase FOXO3.\nNow I'd like to talk\nabout the use of sauna\nto increase growth hormone.\nGrowth hormone is a hormone\nthat we all naturally\nsecrete from our pituitary,\nwhich also resides near\nthe roof of our mouth.\nThe signal for the pituitary\nto release growth hormone\narrives from neurons that\nexist in the hypothalamus.\nSo growth hormone releasing hormones,\nbelieve it or not, that's\nwhat they're called,\nstimulate the release of growth hormone\nfrom the anterior pituitary gland\ninto the general circulation,\nand then growth hormone\nimpacts metabolism and growth\nof cells and tissues of the body.\nIt is responsible for\ntissue repair as well.\nAnd the growth spurt\nthat everyone experiences during puberty\nis the consequence of growth hormone.\nWhat I'm about to describe is a study\nthat found dramatic, really\ndramatic I should say,\nincreases in growth hormone,\nbut I also want to emphasize\nthat these increases\nin growth hormone were not of the sort\nthat are observed in puberty or in infants\nbecoming adolescents or\nadolescents growing into teenagers.\nThose levels of growth\nhormone that are associated\nwith those massive\ntransformations, excuse me,\nof body morphology, of shape,\nare far greater than the sorts\nthat I'm talking about here.\nAnd yet, as all of us age,\nwhen we go from adolescence\nto our teenage years\nand then into a young adulthood,\nbut then starting in our early 30s or so,\nthe amount of growth\nhormone that we secrete\nis greatly diminished.\nNormally we would release\ngrowth hormone every night,\nafter we go to sleep,\nin particular in the\nearly part of the night\nwhen our sleep is comprised\nmostly of slow-wave sleep.\nAs we age, less growth hormone is released\nduring that slow wave sleep.\nThere are various things\nthat can promote the\nrelease of growth hormone,\nand we will talk about\nsome of those other things\nin a moment, things like low blood sugar,\nturns out, is a stimulus\nfor growth hormone release.\nAnd I don't mean hypoglycemia of the sort\nthat makes you dizzy and want to pass out.\nThat's bad.\nI mean, not having high\nlevels of glucose and insulin\nin your bloodstream.\nThis is one of the reasons why many people\nare drawn to intermittent fasting\nor even prolonged fasting,\nit's because of the reported\nincreases in growth hormone.\nI'll touch on those briefly,\nbut if you want to learn more about those\nand what their real impact is\nand the extent of growth hormone,\ncheck out the episode I did on fasting.\nYou can find that at hubermanlab.com.\nCertain forms of exercise\nhave also been shown\nto stimulate growth hormone release.\nAnd in a few moments,\nI'll talk about how exercise\nand fasting can be combined\nor how heat can be combined with exercise\nor certain patterns of food intake\nto further increase growth hormone.\nBut before I do that,\nI want to review some of the data,\nand one study in particular,\nthat discovered certain forms\nof deliberate heat exposure\nusing sauna can stimulate\nvery large increases\nin growth hormone output,\nwhich for people in their\n30s, 40s, and beyond\ncould be very useful,\nand may also be useful for people\nwho are just trying to stimulate\nthe release of more growth hormone\nin order to, for instance,\nrecover from exercise\nor stimulate fat loss or\nmuscle growth or repair\nof a particular injury.\nThe title of this paper\nis \"Endocrine Effects of\nRepeated Sauna Bathing.\"\nAnd this is a paper that\nwas published in 1986,\nwhich is some years ago,\nbut nonetheless serves as a basis\nfor a lot of other studies that followed.\nSo let me describe what\nthey did in this study.\nThey used an 80 degree\nCelsius environment,\nso that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand they had subjects do\nthe sauna for 30 minutes,\nfour times per day.\nSo that's two hours total in one day,\n30 minutes in the sauna, a\nperiod of cool down rest,\n30 minutes in the sauna again,\ncool down rest, a third,\nand a fourth time.\nSo, two hours total in this\n80 degree Celsius environment.\nSo that's a lot,\nbut what they observed was\nreally quite significant.\nSo they had subjects do this protocol,\nand I should mention they had\nboth male and female subjects\nin this study,\nand the entire study lasted a week.\nThey did this two hours of\nsauna exposure on day one,\nday three, and day seven of that week.\nAnd they measured a lot\nof different hormones,\ncortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone,\nthyroid hormone itself,\nluteinizing hormone, and\nfollicle stimulating hormone,\nwhich are hormones that essentially drive\nthe production of other hormones.\nWe won't get into that too deeply,\nbut if you'd like to learn about FSH,\nfollicle stimulating hormone,\nand luteinizing hormone,\nplease see the episode on optimizing\ntestosterone and estrogen\nat hubermanlab.com.\nThey looked at prolactin and\nthey looked at growth hormone.\nI'll just cut to the chase\nand tell you the effects\non growth hormone.\nIn subjects that did this two hour a day,\n80 degree Celsius protocol\nexperienced 16-fold\nincreases in growth hormone.\nSo they measured growth hormone\nbefore the sauna and after the sauna\nand growth hormone levels went up 16 fold,\nwhich is obviously an enormous,\nand it turns out statistically\nsignificant, effect.\nNow, one important caveat here.\nRemember earlier when I talked about\npeople who did sauna once a week\nversus two to three times a week\nversus four to seven times a week,\nand the more often people did sauna,\nthe less likely they were to\ndie of cardiovascular events\nor other things of that sort?\nWell, in this case,\nthe effects of sauna\nexposure on growth hormone\nactually went down the more often\nthat people did this\ndeliberate heat exposure.\nSo as I mentioned,\nthey did this two hour a day\ndivided into 30 minute sessions protocol\non day one, day three,\nand day seven of a week.\nAnd what they found was on day one,\nthere was a 16-fold\nincrease in growth hormone.\nOn day three, however,\nthere was still a significant\neffect on growth hormone\nas compared to before sauna,\nbut that effect was\nbasically cut by two thirds.\nSo now instead of getting\na 16-fold increase,\nit was more like a three\nor four-fold increase,\nwhich is still a huge increase,\nbut not as great as the\nincrease observed on day one.\nAnd then on day seven, there tended to be\na two, maybe a threefold increase,\nbut not as great as the\none observed on day one.\nWhat does this mean?\nAnd why does this happen?\nWell, the reason this\nhappens is because heat,\njust like cold, is a shock\nor a stressor to the system.\nIn the context of cold,\nif you get into a very cold ice bath,\nfor instance, a five-degree\nice bath, even for 20 seconds,\nit's known to increase\nnorepinephrine 200%.\nIt can double the amount of norepinephrine\nthat you suddenly release\ninto your brain and body,\nwhich actually can have\nsome positive effects.\nI'll talk about those in a little bit,\nbut if you were to do that every day,\nyou would become cold adapted.\nThis circuit that compares\nthe shelling core of your body\nwould adjust in ways that\nit could either predict\nthat cold stimulus,\nor more likely to create\nsome thermogenetic mechanisms\nin preparation for that cold exposure.\nThis is why, for instance,\npeople that use deliberate cold exposure\nto try and increase\nlipolysis, the burning of fat,\noftentimes will get results for a while,\nbut then if they're doing it a lot, a lot,\nthey stop getting those effects.\nI talk a lot about\navoiding cold adaptation,\nif that's your goal,\nin the episode on cold,\nbut similar mechanisms are at play here.\nSo we have to imagine that\nwhen the subjects got\ninto the sauna on day one,\nwhatever pathways went\nfrom measurement of\ntemperature at the shell\nto changes in temperature at the core\nled to these big increases\nin growth hormone,\nwhich is basically a way of\njust describing the result\nI already told you before.\nBut the fact that that\nresult diminished over time\neither means that the\ncircuit was not as efficient\nin communicating that shift in temperature\nor that that shift in\ntemperature was of less impact\nbecause the downstream effectors\nwere not engaged to the same extent\nbecause it wasn't as much of a shock.\nAnd I think the latter\nexplanation is far more likely.\nThis is very much akin to weight training\nor cardiovascular exercise,\nwhere if you run up a hill\nvery fast, for instance,\nand your lungs are burning\nand you're heaving and breathing hard,\non the first day, that's\na very painful thing.\nBut if you do it every\nday or every other day,\nprovided you allow yourself to recover,\npretty soon you're running up that hill\nand you're not breathing as hard.\nThere isn't as much\nburning in your muscles,\net cetera, et cetera.\nYour body adapts.\nSo, one of the key things to understand\nabout the use of deliberate heat exposure\nis if you're going to use it\nin order to try and\ntrigger massive increases\nin growth hormone,\nyou're going to need to be careful about\nnot doing it more than,\nlet's say, once a week.\nNow, I'm extrapolating from this study.\nMaybe once every 10 days\nwould be even better,\nbut if you start getting heat adapted,\nit's very unlikely that\nyou're going to get\nthese massive increases in growth hormone.\nSo I don't mean to be discouraging\nof using deliberate heat exposure\nto access growth hormone increases,\nbut if that's your specific\ngoal or your main goal,\nthen I think it's reasonable to say\nthat you don't want to do\ndeliberate heat exposure,\nat least not of the sort\nthat I described here,\nmore than once a week, or\nmaybe even once every 10 days,\nand that you would want to time that\nto other events in your\nlife, maybe hard workouts,\nor if you are trying to push\nthrough a fat loss barrier\nor simply in order to access\ngrowth hormone at peak levels,\nmaybe three times per month\nor four times per month.\nIf you start doing deliberate\nheat exposure more often,\nyou'll still get increases\nin growth hormone,\nbut they are not going\nto be nearly as large\nas the increases in growth hormone\nthat you're going to experience\nif you shock your system\nwith deliberate heat exposure\nevery once in a while.\nAn important way to frame this\nis actually in the context of cold.\nAnd while you might say, wait,\nthis is an episode on heat\nand heating, not cold,\nyou really can't have a\nconversation about heat and heating\nwithout talking about cold.\nBecause, as I mentioned earlier,\nif you cool the outside\nof your body, the shell,\nyou're actually heating up your body.\nIn fact, the circuits that\ncontrol heating of the body\nand that control cooling of the body,\nfor instance, the activation\nof things like shiver\nor fat loss in response\nto cold and shiver,\nthose are also controlled\nby the preoptic area\nof the hypothalamus.\nSo we can take a step back\nand start to think about\nwhat it would take to design\nthe optimal protocol for\ndeliberate heat exposure\nby looking at cold,\nand here's what I mean.\nThere have been beautiful studies\nshowing that if people get\ninto a very cold body of water,\nfour degrees Celsius for 20 seconds.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nthat will cause the a 200 to 300% increase\nin norepinephrine.\nNorepinephrine is also\ncalled noradrenaline.\nAnd norepinephrine and other\nso-called catacholamines\nlike dopamine increased dramatically\nin this very brief cold water exposure.\nAnd those increases in\nnorepinephrine and dopamine\nare known to have long-lasting effects\nthat generally lead to improvements\nin mood, focus, and alertness.\nSo they're pretty significant.\nHowever, they aren't significant enough\nto increase metabolism\nto a very high degree.\nWhereas, other studies have shown\nthat if people go outside\nin 16 degree Celsius weather\nwith a proper amount,\nbut a fairly minimum amount of clothing,\nyou can experience even greater\nincreases in norepinephrine.\nBut the time that's required in order\nto experience those\nincreases is six hours at,\nfor instance, 16 degrees Celsius.\nSo if you have six hours a day\nto be out there in the cold,\nor if you can turn the air conditioning on\nin an environment and make\nit very, very cold, fine.\nBut basically what I'm describing is that\nyou can sort of bookend the\nparameters that you can use.\nYou can use a very brief\nexposure to cold or to heat\nin order to stimulate heat shock proteins,\ngrowth hormone, et cetera,\nor you can use longer exposure\nin less intense versions of heat and cold.\nYou really have to find\nwhat's going to work for you\nand what you can do safely.\nAnd if you're confused\nabout where to start,\nplease use the parameters\nthat I described earlier.\nFirst of all, check with your doctor.\nAs always, make sure that you're somebody\nwho can do deliberate cold\nor heat exposure safely,\nbut that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,\nmeaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit\nto 212 degrees Fahrenheit,\nthat I keep repeating over and over,\n'cause I know somebody's going to ask,\neven though I repeat it over\nand over, which is fine,\nI'm delighted to keep saying it,\nand to respond if someone asks again.\nWell, those parameters\nare going to kind of\nbookend what you should do\nin terms of the intensity\nof the heat stimulus.\nHow long?\nWell, we heard earlier,\nfive to 20 minutes.\nWhy not start with five and\nthen ramp it up to 10 or 15?\nAnd then if you're feeling really bold\nand you really want to\ncrank out growth hormone,\nwell, then you could do\nthat 30 minute four\ntimes in one day stimulus\nevery once in a while.\nSo you have to really figure out\nwhat you're using heat exposure for.\nThis is one of the reasons\nwhy when people say,\nis it better to get in a\nwet sauna or dry sauna?\nWhat's the optimal temperature?\nIs it better to take a hot shower\nor a hot bath or a hot tub?\nTo be completely honest,\nit depends on what you're going\nto be able to do regularly,\nwhether or not you want\nto do it regularly,\nand what your specific goals are.\nSo the purpose of this episode\nis really to arm you with\nthe underlying mechanisms\nand to arm you with the general parameters\nthat are going to allow you\nto access the results that you're seeking.\nFor what it's worth, I\npersonally use a protocol,\nand I've been using a\nprotocol for a long time,\nthat involves trying,\nmeaning I accomplish\nthis most weeks, not all,\ntrying to get into a sauna\nfor three 20-minute sessions every week.\nI use a dry sauna, so\nit's not a steam room.\nIf I don't have access to it,\nI might take a hot bath\nor something of that sort.\nBut in general,\nI just stick to doing the\nsauna three times a week.\nAnd I generally will do\nthat either after a workout,\neither a cardiovascular\nworkout or a weight workout,\nor I will do it later in the evening.\nWhy later in the evening?\nWell, it has to do with the\ncircadian shifts in temperature\nthat we all experience.\nTalked a lot about this\nin the circadian episodes\nand the episodes related to sleep.\nBut in a nutshell, here's how it works.\nEvery early morning,\nabout two hours before\nyour typical wake up time,\nyour body temperature is\nat its all-time lowest.\nWe call that your temperature minimum.\nRight about waking your\nbody temperature increases.\nIn fact, an increase in body temperature\nis part of the reason you wake up at all,\nunless, of course,\nyou're setting an alarm.\nIncreases in body temperature\nare going to be one of the major things\nthat wakes up your brain and body.\nBody temperature will tend to continue\nto increase through the morning.\nYou'll get that increase in cortisol.\nThat's a healthy increase in cortisol.\nBody tempera will increase\ninto the afternoon,\nand then we'll start to\ndrop in the later afternoon.\nThis general contour can be shifted\nby whether or not you\nexercise, how often you eat,\nbecause of the so-called\nthermogenetic effects of food.\nThat is, every time you eat\nthere's a slight increase\nin body temperature and metabolism,\nbut it's not really that significant\nto throw off this general\ncontour and rhythm,\nbut toward the afternoon\naround four or five o'clock,\nmost days, depending on time of year,\nyour body temperature will peak,\nand then it will start to drop.\nAnd as your body temperature\ndrops by one to three degrees,\nand here I'm referring to\nyour core body temperature,\nnot your shell body temperature,\nyou will start to get sleepy\nand to transition into sleep\nand to maintain sleep\nthroughout the night.\nYour body temperature will remain low\nuntil you hit that temperature minimum,\nand then it'll start to come up again.\nWhat that means is that when you decide\nto do sauna, or cold\nexposure for that matter,\nit's going to be important.\nWhy?\nWell, as I mentioned earlier,\nif you were to make the\nsurface of your body cold,\nat least in the immediate\nperiod after that,\nyour body temperature will increase.\nSo for those of you that are\nchallenged in getting to sleep\nand are still working on your sleep,\nremember sleep is the foundation\nof all mental and physical\nhealth and optimal performance,\nyou should try to get really quality sleep\nof sufficient duration,\nat least 80% of nights.\nThat should be an ongoing\ngoal throughout your lifespan\nfor a huge number of reasons.\nWatch the master sleep episode\nif you'd like to hear\nare more of those reasons\nand the mechanisms to make\nsure that you do that.\nBut in any event,\ncold exposure late in the evening\nwill start to increase your\nbody temperature again.\nAnd that can make it hard for\nsome people to fall asleep.\nNow, if you're very, very tired,\nbecause you've been working\nhard or training hard\nor both throughout the day,\nmight not throw off your sleep so much.\nI've gone through bouts\nwhere I'm just so, so busy\nfrom morning till night,\nthat the only time I can\nget into the ice bath\nor the cold shower is late in the evening\nand I have no trouble sleeping after that.\nHowever, if you have trouble sleeping,\nI would recommend doing the\ncold exposure early in the day\nto match that natural heating,\nthat natural increase in body temperature\nthat occurs across the 24-hour\nso-called circadian rhythm.\nSimilarly, if you're going to\nuse deliberate heat exposure,\nyou'd be wise to do that later in the day.\nYou'd be wise to do it later in the day\nbecause when you get\ninto a warm environment,\nsure, the surface of your\nbody, the shell, heats up,\nthe core of your body heats up,\nbut then it also activates\ncooling mechanisms\nthrough the preoptic area,\nand when you get out of\nthat hot environment,\nsauna or otherwise, your body\nwill continue to cool down.\nAnd so many people find\nthat if they do sauna\nin the later half of the day,\nor even just before sleep\nand then take a warmish shower afterwards,\nthen they find it easier to fall asleep.\nAnd that makes sense\nbecause their body\ntemperature is dropping.\nAnd in fact, if your\ngoal is to really promote\nthe maximum amount of\ngrowth hormone release,\nthat's also going to be the\nbest time of day to do it,\nespecially if you haven't eaten\nin the two hours before sleep.\nSo if you're really going\nfor growth hormone release,\nyou're really trying to optimize sleep,\nand the two things are actually linked\nbecause of the release of growth hormone\nthat happens from the pituitary\nin the early nights sleep,\nwell, then you would be\nwise to do your sauna\nmaybe once or maybe twice a week\nin the evening or at nighttime,\nthen taking a warm or\ncool shower just briefly,\njust enough to kind of rinse off\nall the sweat from the sauna,\nand then get ready for sleep.\nAnd to do that, not necessarily fasted,\nbut to try and keep your levels\nof glucose and insulin somewhat\nlow in your bloodstream.\nThe reason I say that is that\nhaving elevated blood glucose\nand or insulin tends to blunt\nor reduce growth hormone release,\nand that's true for any\nnumber of different stimuli\nincluding exercise and including sauna.\nSo there's a really nice study on this\nthat I can point you to,\nis this study that was\npublished in the journal Stress.\nLiterally, that's the name of the journal.\nI love it when journals have these names\nlike Pain or Stress.\nI find that somewhat amusing\nfor reasons that escape me,\nbut nonetheless, amuse me.\nThe title of this study is\n\"Growth Hormone Response\n\"to Different Consecutive\nStress Stimuli in Healthy Men.\n\"Is There Any Difference?\"\nAnd I don't want to go into\nall the details of the study,\nbecause it's pretty\nextensive and complicated,\nbut basically what they\ndid is they had people\ndo sauna and then gave them a drug\nor a condition of having low,\nnot dangerously low, but low blood sugar.\nOr they had them in a condition\nwhere they had low blood\nsugar and then did sauna.\nOr they had them do an exercise protocol\nthat led them to increased growth hormone\nand then had them do low blood sugar.\nBasically mixing and\nmatching the various stimuli\nthat could increase growth hormone.\nAnd what they found was\nvery straightforward.\nWhat they found was that doing sauna once\nand then waiting some period of time\nand then later that day doing sauna again,\nthey didn't see the same increase\nin growth hormone both times.\nFirst they got a big\nincrease in growth hormone\nand then less if they did sauna again.\nIf they had people do\nexercise and then sauna,\nwhat they found was exercise\ncould stimulate growth hormone,\nbut then following it with sauna\ndid not allow you to get\ntwice as much growth hormone.\nIn general, anytime you\nrelease growth hormone,\nyou reduce the likelihood\nthat you're going to\nrelease growth hormone again\nlater that day.\nAnd this partially explains\nthat earlier study,\nwhere if people did this growth\nhormone promoting protocol\non day one, but then on day three\nthey didn't see quite as big an effect,\nand on day seven they didn't\nsee quite as big effect.\nAll it basically boils down to is that\nif you really want to crank out\nthe most amount of growth\nhormone in response to sauna,\ndo it fasted or at least\nnot having ingested any food\nin the two or three hours before.\nYou don't have to be deep into a fast,\nand the whole notion of what breaks a fast\nis kind of an interesting conversation,\nbecause it's contextual.\nWill a sip of coffee break your fast?\nWell, maybe probably not.\nWill one grain of sugar break your fast?\nNo.\nWill an entire candy bar break your fast?\nYes, it has to do with\nwhere your blood glucose is\nwhen you ingest that particular food item.\nNot so much what that\nfood item, is per say.\nBut the bottom line here\nis if you want to crank out\nthe most amount of growth hormone,\nwait a couple of hours after eating\nbefore getting into the sauna,\nor maybe do it before dinner\nand then prepare dinner...\nDo the sauna before dinner, that is,\nthen prepare dinner, then eat dinner,\nand then make sure that\nyou wait a few hours\nbefore going to sleep.\nYou're going to have to arrange\nyour schedule accordingly.\nI know most people can't\narrange their schedule perfectly\njust to get growth hormone increases,\nnor do I think people should approach\nhealth protocols that way.\nI think for 90% of people 90% of the time,\njust getting into the sauna once or twice\nor three times a week is\ngoing to be beneficial\nfor the number of reasons\nthat I described earlier.\nAnd you don't want to obsess too much\nabout out the exact conditions you need\nin order to get the greatest effect\nout of that sauna treatment.\nThese are just some additional tweaks\nrelated to food intake\nand low level hypoglycemia and exercise,\nthat if you wanted to leverage, you could.\nSo if decreases in body temperature\ntend to aid the transition of sleep\nand getting out of a hot sauna\ntends to promote decreases in body,\nit makes sense why you would want to put\nyour sauna exposure or other\ndeliberate heat exposure\nin the second half of your day,\nand maybe even right before sleep.\nNow, regardless of what\ntime of day you do sauna\nor how frequently you do it,\nyou're going to want to hydrate\nafter going in the sauna.\nWhen you go in the sauna, you lose water,\nand when you lose water,\nyou need to replace it.\nWhy?\nWell, you need water for all your cells,\nbut you also need electrolytes.\nSo make sure that you're\nreplacing the water\nthat you lose in the sauna.\nNow there's no exact formula\nof how much water to drink\nand whether or not you need electrolytes\nin that water or not.\nIt's going to depend\non how much you sweat,\nmeaning how heat adapted you are.\nIt's going to depend on how much salt\nyou tend to excrete in your sweat.\nHuge amount of variation, but in general,\none way to approach this\nwould be to make sure\nthat you drink at least 16 ounces of water\nfor every 10 minutes that you\nhappen to be in the sauna.\nYou could do that before\nand during and after,\nyou could do it during and\nafter, or you could do it after.\nNow, there are other reasons\nto do deliberate heat exposure\nthat have nothing to do\nwith cardiovascular effects,\nnothing to do with growth\nhormone or anything of that sort,\nbut rather have to do with improvements\nin mood and mental health.\nIn fact, the data related to sauna\nand other forms of\ndeliberate heat exposure\nimproving mood are very impressive,\nboth at the mechanistic level\nand in terms of the longterm consequences\nthat people experience.\nFirst of all, we need to ask,\nhow is it that deliberate heat exposure\ncan improve our mood and wellbeing?\nWell, it turns out that it\nimproves mood and wellbeing,\nbut it also improves our\ncapacity to feel good\nin response to things that\nwould ordinarily make\nus feel somewhat good.\nNow, this is not a situation\nwhere you're going to be walking\naround grinning ear to ear\nin response to nothing at all,\nsimply because you went in a sauna.\nWhat I'm talking about is the\nup regulation of pathways,\nmeaning chemical pathways\nin your brain and body\nthat allow you to experience\npleasure in all its fullness.\nSo here's how this whole\ndeliberate heat exposure,\nsauna, mood thing works.\nMany of you have probably\nheard of endorphins.\nEndorphins are a category of molecules\nthat are made naturally\nin your brain and body\nand that are released in response\nto different forms of stressors.\nThat's right, in response to stressors.\nSo, if ever you've gone out on a long run,\nand at some point in that run,\nyou feel like you're aching\nand your joints hurt,\nor maybe you have shin splints,\nand you push through that,\npart of the reason that you experience\na lack of pain at some point, usually,\nor you experience a euphoria\nduring or after that exercise\nis the exercise-induced\neffects on endorphin release.\nOr rather, to be more specific,\nI should say the\nexercise-induced consequences\non the stress system,\nwhich in turn trigger\nthe release of endorphin.\nIn other words,\nwhen we experience short\nterm or acute stress,\nthe endorphin system is activated.\nNow the endorphin system is\nnot just about feeling good,\nbelieve it or not.\nIt also about feeling bad.\nAnd there are two general\ncategories of endorphins.\nThe first are the ones that\nyou normally hear about,\nendorphins, things that bind for instance\nto receptors like the mu opioid receptor.\nOpioids are not just prescribed compounds\nor unfortunately drugs of abuse,\nwhich they are.\nWe have this opioid crisis\nin the United States and elsewhere,\nwhich is a very serious and tragic thing,\nbut we make endogenous opioids.\nWe make endorphins that\nnaturally act as pain relievers\nand that make us feel mildly euphoric.\nWe also make endorphins\nsuch as dynorphine,\nthat's D-Y-N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine,\nthat actually make us feel\nworse in response to stressors.\nWhen we get into a hot sauna,\nor a hot environment of any kind,\ndynorphins are liberated\nin the brain and body.\nAnd I should mention\nthat dynorphins are made\nby many neurons in many\ndifferent areas of the brain.\nSo you might think, well,\nwhy would I want that?\nWhy would I want to release\ndynorphine into my brain and body?\nWell, first of all,\nwhen you get into an\nuncomfortably hot situation,\nuncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,\nthis is sounding terrible.\nAnd a deliberately hot environment\nthat you are using to try and trigger\nsome sort of biological\nor psychological benefit,\nI should say,\nthe discomfort that you feel,\nthe desire to get out of that environment,\nis in part the consequence\nof the release of dynorphine.\nIt's also the consequence\nof the activation of that\nsympathetic nervous system.\nRemember, the preoptic\narea can communicate\nwith the amygdala and trigger\nthat kind of fight or flight mode,\nI want to get out of the sauna.\nThis is really, really hot.\nBut dynorphine is also liberated\nfrom a certain number of neurons.\nDynorphine binds to what's\ncalled the CAPA receptor.\nThe CAPA receptor binds dynorphine\nand triggers pathways\nin the brain and body\nthat lead to agitation, to stress,\nand believe it or not to\na general sense of pain.\nThis is why you want to\nget out of the hot sauna,\nand remember if it's unsafe levels of hot,\nthen you should get out of that sauna\nor other hot environment.\nBut if you're working in a range\nor you're exposing yourself\nto a range of heat that's uncomfortable,\nbut safe to be in,\ndynorphine will be liberated\nfrom these neurons, bind\nto the CAPA receptor.\nAnd as a downstream consequence of that,\nthere will be an increase in the receptors\nthat bind the other endorphins,\nthe endorphins that make you feel soothed,\nthat make you feel happy,\nand that make you feel mild euphoria.\nSo there've been a\nnumber of studies showing\nthat initially deliberate heat exposure,\nby sauna or otherwise,\ncauses the release of dynorphine.\nIn fact, I think it's fair to say\nthat every time we get\ninto a hot environment\nthat's uncomfortable\nor a cold environment\nthat's uncomfortable,\ndynorphine is likely released\nand binding to the CAPA receptor.\nBut over time that binding of dynorphine\ninto the CAPA receptor\nleads to downstream changes\nin the way that the feel good endorphins,\nthings like endorphin binding\nto the mu opioid receptor,\nand there are still other\nfeel good endorphins,\nso to speak.\nThat system becomes much more efficient,\nsuch that people feel an elevation\nin their baseline level of mood,\nand when a good or\nhappy event comes along,\nthey feel a heightened\nlevel of happiness or joy\nor awe or improved mood\nin response to that.\nThis is not unlike the effects of caffeine\non the dopamine receptor that\nI've described previously.\nAnd for those of you that\naren't familiar with it,\nmany of you drink caffeine and love it.\nPart of the reason you love it\nis because of the release\nof certain neurochemicals,\nlike norepinephrine, et cetera,\nthe energy that it gives you.\nMaybe the taste, I would hope, as well,\nbut caffeine ingestion\nalso causes increases\nin dopamine receptor\nconcentration and efficacy.\nIn other words, it allows\nthe receptors for dopamine\nto work better so that\nfor a given amount of dopamine release,\nyou experience more\npleasure and motivation.\nThis is a similar mechanism,\nbut within the endorphin pathway.\nSo what does it mean?\nIt means that a little bit of discomfort\nas a consequence of\ndeliberate heat exposure,\nwhile in the short term,\ndoesn't feel good, by definition,\nit is activating pathways\nthat are allowing the feel\nmolecules and neural circuitries\nthat exist in your brain and body\nto increase their efficiency,\nplacing you in a better\nposition to be joyful\nin response to the events of life.\nI confess I'm very excited about the data\non deliberate heat exposure\nand improvements in the chemical systems\nthat underlie good mood.\nAnd just to underscore this further,\nthe dynorphine system is not\nunique to heat-induced stress.\nIn fact, there are beautiful\nstudies and reviews\nout there about the role of dynorphine\nin stress and depression,\nin stress and alcoholism,\njust as a brief aside,\nand in the future we\nwill do a whole episode\non alcohol and alcoholism,\nbut turns out that chronic\nalcohol use and alcoholism\ncauses changes in dopamine receptors\nthat make it very difficult for people\nto achieve pleasure through things\nother than alcohol, and even alcohol.\nThat's kind of the really\ndiabolical nature of addiction,\nwhich is the thing that\ninitially brings pleasure,\neventually is just required\nto maintain baseline levels of dopamine.\nAnd I've talked before,\nand Dr. Anna Lembke,\nwhen she was a guest on this podcast,\ntalked about the pleasure pain balance\nthat exists within the dopamine system.\nIt is beautifully described\nin her book \"Dopamine Nation,\" by the way.\nExcellent book I recommend to\nall people, addicts or not.\nWell, in that context of pleasure and pain\nit's very clear what the\npleasure molecule is.\nIt's actually a molecule\nmore related to motivation,\nand that's dopamine.\nThe pain molecule, however,\nappears to be dynorphine.\nAnd the fact that\ndynorphine is dysregulated\nin stress and depression and alcoholism\nand the relationship between\ndynorphine and dopamine\nis something that we should\nall take very seriously.\nAnd for that reason,\nI'm very excited about the fact\nthat deliberate heat exposure\ncan leverage the dynorphine system\nin a short term and an acute way\nthat allows mood to improve\nafter the sauna exposure.\nSo, for those of you that\ndon't like heat exposure,\nkeep in mind that a lot of\nthe observed positive effects\non our biology relate to metabolism,\ncardiovascular function,\nbut also mental health.\nAnd along those lines,\nthere is a wonderful study,\nagain, published in 2018.\nI don't know why.\nI guess 2018 was a big year\nfor deliberate heat exposure studies.\nThe title of this study is \"Sauna Bathing\n\"and Risk of Psychotic Disorders.\"\nAnd this was a prospective cohort study.\nAgain, we'll provide a link to this study.\nIt's a really interesting study\nthat explored the relationship\nbetween mental health,\nso people suffering from\nvarious forms of psychoses,\nschizophrenia and other\nforms of psychoses,\nand use of sauna.\nSo essentially what this study did\nis they looked at a very\nlarge number of subjects,\nmore than 2,000 subjects,\nwho had no history of psychotic disorders.\nThey were classified into three groups\nbased on their frequency of sauna use,\neither once a week, two to\nthree to times per week,\nor four to seven times per week.\nThis should call to\nmind that earlier study\non all-risk mortality and\ncardiovascular event risk.\nAnd then they explored the hazard ratio\nfor psychosis specifically,\nmeaning how likely it was that people\nwould develop psychotic symptoms\nor full blown psychotic illness,\naccording to their\nfrequency of sauna session.\nSo, again, this isn't\ncausal, this is correlative.\nAnd according to the data in this study,\nwhat they concluded is that\nthere was a strong and inverse\nindependent association\nbetween frequent sauna bathing\nand the future risk of psychotic disorders\nin this population.\nNow, this does not mean that going\ninto a sauna seven times per week\nis going to prevent people\nfrom becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,\nor from having a psychotic\nepisode, necessarily.\nAnd of course, frequent sauna use will be\nrelated to other\nhealth-promoting activities.\nBut in this study, as\nin the previous study,\nthey went to great lengths in order to try\nand limit those so-called\nconfounding variables.\nNow, of course, this is just one study,\nand again, it's correlative, not causal,\nbut based on the large number\nof subjects they included,\nplus the rigor of the\nstatistical analysis,\nwe're starting to see a general picture\nthat using the sorts of sauna protocols\nthat I've described\nthroughout this episode,\nfive to 20 minutes or so,\ndone one to seven times per week\nis associated with a general improvement\nin cardiovascular health,\na general improvement in mental health,\nand it really points to the fact that,\nyes, sauna done acutely for\nthree or four times a day,\n30 minutes each session\nseparated by cooling,\nmaybe getting into cold bath,\nsure that can potently\nincrease growth hormone,\nbut done on a more regular\nbasis can reduce cortisol,\nimprove heart health,\nimprove mental health.\nAnd for that reason, and the\nfact that for most people,\nit is conceivable to come up with a way\nthat you could get into\ndeliberate heat exposure\nfor a minimum of cost.\nIf it's a hot bath, or\nif you had to resort to\nbundling up and going for\na jog, this sort of thing,\nor if you have access to\nit, a sauna of some sort,\nthat we're really talking about a stimulus\nto initiate a large number of\ndifferent biological cascades\nthat wick out to improve multiple aspects\nof brain and body health.\nSo up until now, I've been\ntalking about whole body heating.\nSo for instance, putting your\nwhole body into the sauna,\nwhich of course is what most people do,\nor getting into a hot tub\nor hot bath up to your neck,\nor in the cases where we were talking\nabout deliberate cold exposure as a means\nto increase core body\ntemperature and metabolism,\ngetting into an ice bath\nor cold water of some sort\nup to your neck or into\na cold shower, et cetera.\nNow I'd like to talk about\ndeliberately heating or cooling\nspecific parts of the body,\nmeaning certain surface areas of your body\nas a means to get effects\non those particular areas,\nas well as at the whole body level.\nNumerous times throughout this episode,\nI've talked about the\ndangers of overheating.\nSo what should you do if you\nthink you or someone else\nis hyperthermic, is too hot?\nWell, if you understand just a little bit\nabout the cooling and heating systems\nof your shell and core,\nthere are some terrific\ntools that you can use\nin order to cool off your core quickly.\nAnd remember the core consists\nof the nervous system,\nthe spinal cord, and the viscera,\nwhich are really the organs\nyou're trying to protect.\nSo, being able to cool off\nthe core of your body quickly\ncan be very beneficial,\nand in some cases, it\ncould even save your life.\nThere is a way to more\nquickly heat or cool the body,\nand that's through specific\nelements of your shell,\nmeaning particular skin surfaces.\nI've talked extensively about\nthis in the episode on cold.\nIt was also covered in the episode\nwith my guest, Dr. Craig Heller,\nfrom the Biology Department at Stanford.\nIt relates to the so-called\nglabrous skin surfaces\non the upper half of our face,\npalms of our hands, and\nthe bottoms of our feet.\nAnd for those of you that\nhave heard this before\nI encourage you to continue\nto listen nonetheless,\nbecause today I'm going to talk about\nspecifically how to heat\nthe body or cool the body\nthrough these glabrous skin surfaces.\nVery briefly, the mechanism is as follows.\nThe palms of our hands,\nthe bottoms of our feet,\nand the upper half of our face\noverly specific types of vasculature,\nmeaning specific types\nof veins and arteries\nthat don't have capillaries between them,\nand as a consequence,\nheat and cold can move very quickly\nfrom the palms of the hands,\nthe bottoms of the feet,\nand the upper half of our face,\nand change our core body temperature.\nThere's a name for these\nparticular vascular structures.\nThey're called AVAs or\narteriovenous astemoses.\nBasically veins and arteries\ninteracting directly\nwithout capillaries in between,\nwhich allows cooling of\nblood or heating of blood\nmuch more quickly than is possible\nby applying colder heat\nelsewhere on the body,\nwhere capillaries intervene\nbetween veins and arteries.\nThese AVAs, arteriovenous anastomoses,\ncan be leveraged to cool off\nyour core body temperature very quickly.\nThe key thing is to get\nthe palms of your hands,\nthe bottoms of your feet, and\nthe upper half of your face\nin contact with a cold surface or fluid\nthat is cold enough to cool the blood\nand the core of your body,\nbut not so cold that\nit constricts the veins\njust below the palms of your hands,\nthe bottoms of your feet, or\nthe upper half of your face.\nSo, not placing ice packs necessarily,\nbut maybe placing cool towels\non the bottoms of feet,\nthe palms of the hands, and\nthe upper half of the face,\nand as they warm up, replacing\nthose with other cool towels.\nThe exact temperature will depend\non how hot you happen to be.\nI can't know that without\nknowing your particular circumstances.\nIf you'd like to learn more about\nhow to cool off your core very quickly,\nand some of the details and\nsome of the technologies\nthat are being developed to do that,\nplease see the episode\nI did with Craig Heller\nor the episode on cold.\nIf you don't want to go to those episodes,\nhere is a good procedure\nthat you could use.\nYou could grab, for instance,\na package of frozen broccoli\nor frozen blueberries.\nIf someone is really, really warm,\nmake sure they take off\ntheir shoes and socks,\nget their feet on top of those.\nIdeally get some into their hands as well.\nGet some cool compresses and\nget them onto people's face.\nYou could, of course,\nalso put a cool compress\non the back of the neck,\non the top of the head.\nThat would be an especially good idea\nif someone were hyperthermic\nbecause of the way that\ncooling of the brain occurs\nunder conditions of hyperthermia.\nBut the key point here is that\njust putting cold\ncompresses or cold materials\nonto somebody's torso is\nnot going to be as efficient\nas cooling those glabrous skin surfaces,\nthe bottoms of the feet,\nthe palms of the hands,\nand the upper half of their face.\nSimilarly, or I suppose\nto be more accurate,\nI should say, conversely,\nthere are times when it is desirable\nto heat the core of the body.\nAnd once again,\njust simply throwing a\nhot towel over somebody\nis not going to be the most efficient way.\nIf someone is hypothermic,\nthey're too cold,\nit is not a problem to\ncover them with a blanket.\nBut ideally what you do is\nyou use some warm object\nor warm fluid to warm the\nbottoms of their feet,\ntheir hands, and the\nupper half of their face.\nOf course not so warm that\nyou burn those skin surfaces.\nThis has actually been examined in studies\nfrom the Heller Lab.\nTurns out that, for instance,\nto get people out of anesthesia,\nit is beneficial to warm\ntheir core body temperature.\nAnd of course there is fever,\nwhich you should know\nis an adaptive response.\nWhile fever is uncomfortable,\nand in fact often involves a mismatch\nbetween our perception of our shell\nand a perception of our core temperature.\nIn other words,\nthere are times when our body\ntemperature is really high,\nwe have a fever, and yet we're\nshivering and we're cold.\nAnd that's because under\nconditions of fever,\nthe immune system\nliberates certain molecules\nthat impact, and in some ways,\nintentionally disrupt the\npreoptic area, the POA,\nand the way it normally functions\nso that it can override peripheral signals\nand simply try and heat the body\nand kill whatever pathogen\nhas infected the body.\nSo for those of you that think about fever\nas always a bad thing, it's not.\nNow, of course we don't want\nour core body temperature\nto go so high that tissues of\nthe brain and body are damage.\nThis is one reason why, if\na fever ever goes above 103,\nyou need to start getting\na little bit worried, 104.\nThere are times when you\nneed to call an ambulance\nor go to a hospital,\nyou really need to employ cooling methods\nof the sort that I talked about before\nto prevent hyperthermia.\nOf course, safe ranges\nfor body temperature\nvary between infants and adults.\nSo you can look those up online,\ndepending on the person's\nage, what is a safe range,\nwhat is not.\nBut keep in mind that if\nyou are taking compounds,\npills to reduce your fever,\nyou are actually short circuiting\nthe protective mechanism\nfor burning up the pathogen.\nAnd that's because most pathogens,\nbacteria and virus, don't survive\nwell at high temperatures.\nIn fact, in laboratories,\nif we want to preserve a virus for use,\nwe put it into a freezer.\nIf we want to kill a virus,\nwe heat inoculate it.\nSo in many ways, fever\nis your natural form\nof heat inoculation\ndesigned to kill pathogens\nof various kinds.\nNow last, but certainly not least,\nI want to refer to the\nstudy that I described\nat the very beginning of this episode,\ninvolving what's called local hyperthermia\nin order to trigger a number\nof biological processes\nin fat tissue in order to\nconvert white fat to beige fat,\nwhich is the metabolically\nactive form of fat.\nMany of you, or at least some of you,\nshould be familiar with the fact\nthat deliberate cold exposure\ncan increase brown fat stores,\nthese mitochondrial dense\nfat stores that can, in turn,\nallow a person to feel more comfortable\nin cold temperatures, water, or otherwise,\nand increase core metabolism.\nI talked about this in\nthe episode on cold,\nbut very briefly, the\ngeneral protocol, again,\nis to get 11 minutes total\nper week of uncomfortable,\nyet safe deliberate cold exposure,\neither through ice bath, cold shower,\ncold immersion up to the neck,\nor some other form of cold exposure.\nThat triggers increases in brown fat.\nThat's been beautifully\nshown by Dr. Susanna Søberg.\nAnd that increase in brown fat\nin turn increases core metabolism\nand one's ability to feel\ncomfortable in cool temperatures.\nThis was a study done in humans,\nand there's now ample\nevidence from animal models\nto support that this\nis a general phenomenon\nthat I think most people\ncould use and benefit from.\nLocal hyperthermia is a\ndistinctly different phenomenon.\nIt involves heating a\nparticular surface of the body\nas a way to convert the\nwhite fat at that location\nto beige fat, which in turn\nleads to more systemic increases\nin thermogenesis and\nincreases in metabolism,\nand believe it or not, in fat loss.\nNow, the study that I'm referring to\nis a very recent study that was published,\nagain, in this terrific\napex journal, Cell,\nCell Press Journal.\nAnd again, one of the three top journals,\nNature, Science, and Cell\nare the three top journals.\nTop because they're the most competitive,\nbut also generally, not always,\nbut generally the most stringent\nin terms of the review process.\nPapers that make it into\nthese three journals\ngenerally are of very, very high quality.\nAnd certainly enough people see them that\nif they're not of high quality,\nthey get shot down pretty quickly\nin a short amount of time.\nWhereas papers in other journals\ncan sometimes last a long time\nbefore they're ever replicated, et cetera.\nThe title of this paper\nis \"Local Hyperthermia Therapy\nInduces Browning of White Fat\n\"and Treats Obesity.\"\nThis was a study that was\nperformed on mice and humans\nin the same study.\nWhat this study involved was heating\nof a local patch of skin\nto 41 degrees Celsius,\nwhich is a 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,\nbut not damaging the skin.\nSo the methods of heating\ndid not involve placing something\non the skin that would damage it.\nIn fact, in the study on the mice,\nthey used this kind of\nclever molecular chicanery\nin order to do it.\nAnd in humans, they used a thermocouple\nthat would allow them to heat the skin up\njust locally in particular\nlocations on the body\nthat I'll talk about in a moment.\nThey refer to this process as\nLHT, or local heat therapy.\nThe reason they did this\nis worth considering.\nIt's long been known from clinical data.\nAnd in fact, from a bit of research data\nthat people that\nexperience burn on a small,\nor unfortunately in some circumstances,\nsignificant portion of their body\nexperience overall decreases in body fat\nand increases in metabolism\nthat can last many years,\nNow, of course, is not\nreasonable nor would one\never want to induce burn in\norder to induce fat loss.\nBut the observed increases\nin metabolism and fat loss\nin response to skin surface burn\ncouldn't be explained by\nreductions in activity\nrelated to the burn, for instance.\nAnd in fact, there are molecular pathways\nrelated to something called UCP1,\nwhich is uncoupling protein one.\nI talked about this also\nin the cold episode,\nbut don't worry if you\ndidn't see that episode,\nor if you choose not to.\nUCP1 has the ability to\nincrease mitochondrial function\nin ways that increase core\nbody temperature overall,\nin particular, in beige and brown fat,\nwhich are these fat cells that exist\ngenerally along our\nspine, and in particular,\nin the upper part of our back\nand around our neck and clavicles.\nAnd they're responsible for\nacting as this sort of a candle,\nor I should say the fuel\nor the fat of a candle\nthat can be burned up to\nmanufacture heat in the body.\nSo, if you normally think about fat\nand you think about blubbery fat,\nyou're thinking about white fat,\nwhich again is just a storage site.\nBeige fat and brown fat exist\nat just a few locations,\nmainly internally, around our\nspinal cord and our clavicles,\nand those fat stores are responsible\nfor generating heat in our body.\nSo they're a very metabolically\nactive form of fat.\nSmall children have a lot\nof brown fat and beige fat,\nin particular because very\nyoung children can't shiver.\nA number of you probably didn't know that,\nbut very young children can't shiver,\nso they need some way to generate heat\nin order to make sure that they stay alive\nif they were ever to get cold.\nThis is also probably the\nreason why little kids\ncan run around on a cold day\noutside without their shirt on\nand they don't even seem to notice,\nwhereas adults are freezing cold.\nAs we get older, the amount\nof beige and brown fat\ntends to either reduce or\nshrink or disappear entirely.\nIt's still debated which happens.\nBut we know that white\nfat can be converted\nto this more metabolically\nactive form of beige fat\nby deliberate cold exposure,\naccording to the protocol\nI talked about earlier,\nand now it seems, based on this new study,\nthat local heating of skin\ntissue can also induce UCP1\nand the effects of UCP1 on\nincreasing mitochondria.\nAnd in fact, that local\nhyperthermia, 41 degrees Celsius,\nthat is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,\ncan actually induce the conversion\nof white fat to beige fat.\nNow that's pretty interesting,\nand I can already predict the\nway this is probably going to go\nin the kind of wellness and biohacking\nand longevity communities.\nI'm sure that pretty soon\nthere are going to be\npeople putting heating pads\non different fat pads\nof theirs on their body,\ntrying to reduce,\nor at least convert the\nwhite fat into beige fat.\nAnd who knows, maybe that'll work.\nThere have not been many\ncontrolled studies of this yet.\nThis is the first, at\nleast to my knowledge,\nof such studies looking at\nthis in non-burn conditions.\nNonetheless, the data are mechanistically\neven more interesting\nthan this whole business\nabout UCP1, and here's why.\nLocal hyperthermia,\nusing the protocol that\nI described before,\nresulted in the increase of a promoter,\nwhich is essentially a mechanism\nby which certain genes\nregulate their activity.\nThis is a DNA binding of\nsomething called HSF1.\nWe don't have to go too\ndeep into the mechanism here\nor the nomenclature,\nbut HSF stands for heat shock factor one.\nAnd HSF1 binding to a particular location\nin the genome allowed\nfor a different molecule\nwith a very long name.\nI'll just tell it to you for fun,\nbut you can just let the\nnumbers and letters stream by.\nIt's not important.\nHNRNPA2B1, shortened to A2B1,\nwhich frankly is not that\nshort to begin with, A2B1,\nis still a name that should be meaningless\nto most everybody, but\nhere's what's really cool.\nA2B1 is directly involved in\nglucose and lipid metabolism\nand regulates the genes that control\nglucose and lipid metabolism.\nSo here we have a situation\nwhere local heating of skin\nconverted a metabolically\nsluggish or inactive cell type,\nthe white fat cell, into\nthe metabolically charging,\nso to speak, beige fat cell, which in turn\nled to systemic, meaning\nbody-wide increases in metabolism,\nthrough two mechanism.\nOne mechanism is this increase in UCP1,\nwhich for those of you that want to know,\nUCP1 causes shifts in the way\nthat potential energy is\npushed from the protons\nthrough the mitochondria,\nbasically more mitochondrial function,\nwhich means more ATP,\nwhich means cells are more active,\nAKA, increased metabolism,\nand increases in things like\nheat shock factor one and A2B1,\nwhich are involved in lipid\nand glucose metabolism and regulation.\nSo I want to be very clear,\nthis study does not\nsay that spot reduction\nis possible with local heating of tissue.\nI just can see it now that once this paper\ngets out into the press,\npeople are going to say,\noh, heating up a certain patch of skin\nis going to burn fat or convert fat\nto some other cell type at that location.\nSorry, that's not the way it works.\nThey did observe increases\nin beige fat cells\nat certain locations in the body.\nBut those increases in beige fat\noccurred where beige\nfat cells always reside,\naround the spine, the upper neck,\nthe clavicles, and so on.\nThis is exciting because it provides\nyet another potential mechanism\nin addition to deliberate cold exposure\nto increase beige fat,\nmeaning the metabolically\nactive form of fat cell.\nIt also nicely provides a mechanism,\nor at least a potential mechanism,\nfor the observation that burn,\neither small patch of skin being burned,\nor again, sadly large\npatches of skin being burned,\nleading to these very\nextreme and very long lasting\nincreases in body fat loss and metabolism.\nWhat, if anything, should\nyou do with this information?\nWell, first of all, I want\nto very much caution people\nabout putting anything\nso hot that it can damage\nthe surface of your skin onto your skin.\nThat would be a terrible idea.\nHowever, I do predict a\ntime not too far from now\nwhere people will start to explore the use\nof local skin heating as a means\nto increase the conversion\nof white to beige fat,\nand in turn for beige fat stores\nto increase metabolism overall,\nand maybe even improve glucose\nmetabolism and thermogenesis.\nIf you'd like more detail\nelse about this study,\nwe will provide a link to it\nin the show notes caption.\nI should mention that the study,\nat least the portion of the study\nthat was focused on humans,\ninvolved roughly equal\nnumbers of males and females.\nThe subjects followed their\nnormal daily schedule,\nincluding time and composition\nof meals, they say,\nrest and active hours,\net cetera, et cetera.\nThe local hyperthermia therapy was done\nin the following way.\nHere I'm paraphrasing from\ntheir methods section.\nSubjects were seated\nin an upright posture.\nThey were wearing a standard test robe\nwith the head and neck\nand shoulders unclothed\nand one meter away from\na thermal imaging camera,\nwhich could basically\nmeasure the temperature\nat their skin surface to make sure\nthat it remained constant\nacross subjects and yet safe.\nThe supraclavicular fat deposits,\nmeaning the upper shoulders\nand upper back area,\nwere exposed to this thermal source,\nagain, 41 degrees for 20 minutes.\nSo it was 41 degrees for 20 minutes.\nAnd their core temperatures\nand skin temperatures\nwere monitored before and after\nthis local hyperthermic therapy.\nThe subjects were exposed to\nthis local hyperthermia therapy\nthree days per week, separated by day,\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday,\nso they had weekends off,\nfor five weeks total,\nafter which their data were collected.\nAnd the study has a number\nof other really interesting features\nthat are sure to lead to\nincreased understanding\nof both mechanism and new protocols,\nsuch as analysis of the genes and proteins\nthat are activated downstream\nof this local hyperthermia therapy.\nI find these data incredibly interesting,\nin part because of the ways\nthat local hyperthermia therapy\nmimics deliberate cold exposure therapy.\nSame downstream mechanisms, UCP1,\nand some of the other\npathways are involved,\nand all of that points to a somewhat new,\nbut certainly an important concept.\nMany of you have probably\nheard of hormesis,\nwhich is the subjecting of one's self,\nor others, I suppose,\nto enough stress to induce\nan adaptation of some kind.\nSo hormesis is the reason why\nif you get into cold water repeatedly,\nat first, it's very\npainful psychologically,\nand over time you get used to it.\nYou never get completely used to it,\nbut you get more used to it.\nHormesis is also used to\ndescribe the adaptation\nto cardiovascular exercise\nor to the hard rep sets\nof resistance training\nand the growth of muscles\nor the strengthening of muscles\nor the improvement in\ncardiovascular function\nto endurance exercise and so forth.\nHormesis is a somewhat\ncommon term nowadays.\nIf you haven't heard\nit, now you've heard it.\nIn this paper they describe\nwhat is called mitohormesis,\nwhich is, in essence,\nthe fact that any number of\ndifferent stressful stimuli,\nprovided they activate UCP1\nand some of these other\npathways that I just described,\nlike HSF1, can induce\nchanges in the mitochondria\nthat lead to increases in metabolism.\nSo it shouldn't surprise\nus that cold and heat\ncan both lead to increases\nin metabolism and conversion\nof white fat to beige fat.\nIt shouldn't surprise us because\nboth pathways are stress.\nLocal hyperthermia is stress.\nBurn certainly is stress.\nSauna is a form of stress.\nDeliberate cold exposure\nis a form of stress.\nExercise is a form of stress.\nAnd the adaptation to those\nstressors is not infinite.\nAll of those protocols, any\nprotocol for that matter,\nis going to be effective\nbecause it's going to converge\non an existing internal\nbiological mechanism.\nSo there's no unique\nmechanism for each protocol.\nEach protocol that I've\ntalked about today,\nwhether or not it's five\nminutes or 20 minutes\nor four times in a day\nor three times per week\nor seven times per week\nis tickling or pushing\nor stomping, if you will,\non a given pathway and\nreally activating it\nto a mild or to a severe degree.\nWhat I've tried to do\nis to illustrate the general mechanisms\nby which heat in particular\ncan activate certain biological pathways\nso that you can devise protocols\nthat are going to be optimal\nfor you and your needs.\nSo just to briefly recap,\nif you want to get the greatest\ngrowth hormone increases,\ndo sauna or other deliberate\nheat exposure fairly seldom,\nprobably no more than once\nper week, maybe even less,\nand do it a lot that day.\nJust make sure that you break\nit up into multiple sessions.\nIn the study I described\nearlier they did four sessions,\n30 minutes each.\nBut that was just once a week.\nIf you're interested in\nthe cardiovascular benefits\nand the potential longevity\nbenefits of sauna,\nwell then it's clear that\ndoing it three to four,\nmaybe even seven times per week\nis going to be more beneficial\nthan doing it just one\nor three times per week.\nIt stands to reason that\nfor those of you interested\nin the general health effects of sauna,\nabout an hour per week\nbroken up into three sessions\nmakes the most sense based\non my read of the data.\nAnd again, that range of\n80 to 100 degrees Celsius\nis going to be your guide.\nAnd in terms of the\nmental health benefits,\nit seems that getting a\nlittle bit uncomfortable\nin that heat environment,\nsauna or otherwise,\nprovided it's safe, is\ngoing to be the best way\nto access those mental health effects\nby way of increasing dynorphine,\nwhich, as you recall,\nwill then increase the\nability of endorphin\nto have its positive effects on mood\nafter you get out of the sauna\nor other deliberate heat exposure.\nAnd in terms of timing,\nafter a workout of any kind,\nmorning or afternoon,\nor if you're not doing it after a workout,\ncertainly in the later part of the day\nis going to be most beneficial\nas it relates to sleep.\nBut of course, there's a caveat there,\nwhich I will mention again,\nwhich is that for those of you\nthat have no trouble sleeping\n'cause you're exhausted\nor you're just one of\nthese phenomenal sleepers,\nwell then do it any time of day or night.\nBut for most people\ndoing it later in the day\nis going to be more beneficial\nbecause of the post sauna cooling effect\nand the relationship between\ncooling by a degree or more\nas a way to enter sleep.\nThank you for joining me\ntoday for my discussion\nabout the science of heat\nand heating for health.\nIf you are learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to us on
