    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the hubman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today marks the sixth episode\nin our sixth episode series all about\nsleep with expert guest Dr Matthew\nWalker today's episode focuses on sleep\nand dreaming as well as lucid dreaming\nwe talk about what's happening in your\nbrain when you dream both mundane dream\nas well as heavily emotionally Laden\ndreams and we discuss how to think about\nand perhaps even interpret the content\nof your dreams and we talk about lucid\ndreaming which are dreams that occur\nwhile in sleep of course in which you\nare aware that you are dreaming and\nbecause Unfortunately they are\nrelatively common we also talk about\nnightmares and both what to do about\nnightmares as well as how to think about\nnightmares this being the final episode\nin the six episode series all about\nsleep I put the call out on my social\nmedia handles for any and all questions\nabout sleep that I could direct to Dr\nMatthew Walker so as today's episode\ncloses I ask him those questions\nfocusing specifically on the questions\nthat were most frequently asked by you\nthe audience and he answers them in\nRapid succession before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is better help\nbetter help offers Professional Therapy\nwith a licensed therapist carried out\nonline now I've been doing therapy for\nwell over 30 years initially I had to do\ntherapy against my will but of course I\ncontinue to do it voluntarily over time\nbecause I really believe that doing\nregular therapy with a quality therapist\nis one of the best things that we can do\nfor our mental health indeed for many\npeople it's as beneficial as getting\nregular physical exercise the great\nthing about better help is that it makes\nit very easy to find a therapist that's\noptimal for your needs and I think it's\nfair to say that we can define a great\ntherapist as somebody with whom you have\nexcellent Rapport somebody with whom you\ncan talk about a variety of different\nissues and who can provide you not just\nsupport but also insight and with better\nhelp they make it extremely convenient\nso that it's matched to your schedule\nand other aspects of your life if you'd\nlike to try betterhelp you can go

everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans plenty of the electrolytes\nmagnesium potassium and sodium and no\nsugar as I mentioned before on this\npodcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want\nto be clear people who already consume a\nlot of salt or who have high blood\npressure or who happen to consume a lot\nof processed foods that typically\ncontain salt need to control their salt\nintake however if you're somebody who\neats pretty clean and you're somebody\nwho exercises and you're drinking a lot\nof water there's a decent chance that\nyou could benefit from ingesting more\nElectro ltes with your liquids the\nreason for that is that all the cells in\nour body including the nerve cells the\nneurons require the electrolytes in\norder to function properly so we don't\njust want to be hydrated we want to be\nhydrated with proper electrolyte levels\nwith element that's very easy to do what\nI do is when I wake up in the morning I\nconsume about 16 to 32 ounces of water\nand I'll dissolve a packet of element in\nthat water I'll also do the same when I\nexercise especially if it's on a hot day\nand I'm sweating a lot and sometimes\nI'll even have a third element packet\ndissolved in water if I'm exercising\nreally hard or sweating a lot or if I\njust notice that I'm not consuming\nenough salt with my food if you'd like\nto try element you can go to

Helix sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that are customized to your\nunique sleep needs it's abundantly clear\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwhen we're getting enough quality sleep\neverything in life goes so much better\nand when we are not getting enough\nquality sleep everything in life is that\nmuch more challenging now one of the key\nthings to getting a great night sleep is\nto have the appropriate mattress\neveryone however has slightly different\nneeds in terms of what would be the\noptimal mattress for them Helix\nunderstands that people have unique\nsleep needs and they've designed a brief\ntwo-minute quiz that asks you questions\nlike do you sleep on your back your side\nor your stomach do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night or maybe you\ndon't know the answers to those\nquestions if you go to the Helix site\nand take that brief quiz they'll match\nyou to to a mattress that's optimal for\nyou for me it turned out to be the dusk\nD mattress it's not too hard not too\nsoft and I sleep so much better on my\nHelix mattress than on any other type of\nmattress I've used before so if you're\ninterested in upgrading your mattress go\nto helixsleep.com\nhuberman take their brief two-minute\nsleep quiz and they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you and for this\nmonth only

Dr Walker my day good\nfellow Dr\nhubman today is the Sixth and final\nepisode in the six episode series that\nwe've been recording on sleep during\nepisode one you told us about the\nbiology of sleep and some actionable\nitems to get the basics of sleep well\nworked out for each of us and it's\nhighly particular to our individual\nneeds and you explained to define those\nneeds then you beautifully described\nin-depth protocols for let's call it\noptimizing one sleep and then a third\nepisode focused on caffeine napping and\nalso food intake and its impact on\nsleep we talked about the relationship\nbetween sleep and learning and memory\nand\ncreativity and then of course in the\nfifth episode just prior to this one you\nbeautifully described the literature and\nactionable tools for connecting sleep\nsleep to emotional health and mental\nhealth as well as the relationship\nbetween lack of sleep and certain mental\nhealth challenges or\nconditions today we are going to dive\ninto a truly exciting and fascinating\ntopic which is dreaming I can think of\nfewer topics more intriguing than dreams\nI know there's a lot of interest in\nlucid dreaming that is one dreaming\nwhile being aware that one is dreaming\nyou'll tell us more about that but I\nthink Dreams Just Intrigue and Fascinate\nus for so many reasons but not the least\nof which is that at some point we all\nseem to have them and they seem to have\na relevance for our lives they're not\njust epip phenomena as we say so today I\nknow you're going to explain what they\ndo and do not provide for us and I'm\nreally excited to dive into this topic\nit's something that I've been fascinated\nby and I know many people are fascinated\nby so just to kick things off how do we\nDefine dreaming what is a dream what is\na dream\nstate you would think it's fairly simple\nbecause when people say oh I had the\nstrangest dream last night everyone\nseems to know what a dream and by the\nway dreaming is is we take it for\ngranted we say oh I had a strange dream\nlast night just think about it though\nlast night both you and I and everyone\nlistening as long as they slept we all\nbecame flagrantly\npsychotic now now before you reject my\nmy diagnosis of your nightly psychosis\nI'll give you five good reasons first\nwhen we start to dream we see things\nwhich are not there so we hallucinate\nsecond we believe things that could not\npossibly be true so we're delusional\nthird we get confused about time place\nand person so we're suffering from\ndisorientation fourth we have these\nwildly fluctuating emotions something\nthink that's psychiatrists called being\naffectively\nlabile and then how wonderful you woke\nup this morning and you forgot most if\nnot all of that dream experience so you\nare suffering from\nAmnesia if you were to experience any\none of those five symptoms while you're\nawake we'd probably be seeking\npsychological or psychiatric treatment\nbut for reasons that we still don't\nfully understand that seems to be a\nnormal biological and psychological and\nin fact and I'll describe the data\nabsolutely necessary life support\nperhaps necessary set of experiences to\ngo\nthrough so that's the peculiarity of\ndreaming but how do we Define it one of\nthe loose definitions that we often use\nin sleep science is that a dream is any\nreport of mental activity upon Awakening\nso I'll come into the laboratory and\nI'll wake you up and I'll say what was\ngoing through your mind and if you just\nsay nothing think really then we note\nthat down as no dream\nreport but if you were to say well you\nknow what I was actually just thinking\nabout the next time you're going to come\nin and wake me\nup um then we would report that as a\ndream but that's not really what most\npeople mean when they say I had this\nstrange dream what they're referring to\nis dreaming that takes place during the\nstage of sleep called rapid eye movement\nsleep or REM sleep and during REM sleep\nthere we have these bizarre\nhallucinogenic these Vivid these\nnarrative these emotion filled story\nexperiences those are the types of\nreports that we get principally from Ram\nsleep so if I were to go back to episode\none and say think about those different\nstages of sleep light non-rm sleep deep\nnon-rm sleep and REM sleep when does\ndreaming occur well if I wake you up\nduring stage two nonrem sleep that's one\nof the lighter forms of non-rm early in\nthe night but especially later in the\nnight you typically will report a dream\nmaybe about 50% probability 50% of the\ntime I wake you up out of that stage no\nreport the other half yes if I wake you\nup out to a deep non-r sleep stages\nthree and four where down to a 0 to 20%\nchance that you'll report a dream so\nvery very unlikely if I wake you up out\nof REM sleep somewhere between 80 to 90%\nprobability that you were going to\nreport a dream there's Nuance in that\nREM sleep Story by the\nway rapid eye movement sleep is defined\nby those rapid eye movements but when\nyou're in that stage of sleep you're not\nalways having the eye movements they\ncome in these strange phases so though\nyou will be in REM sleep and we can\nDefine that with lots of different um\nsensors on your brain and your body but\nthen there will be times when your eyes\nare darting back and forth and times\nwhen your eyes are not and when those\neyes are moving during REM sleep we call\nthat phasic REM sleep and when they're\nnot we call it tonic REM sleep don't\nworry about the the\nterminology when I wake you up out of\ntonic R sleep when the eyes aren't\nmoving I'm around that 80% probability\nif I wake you up out of real sleep when\nyour eyes are darting back and forth\nthere is 95 to 100% probability that\nyou're going to report a\ndream some people theories in the past\nhave said well if that's the case then\npresumably those eye movements are\ntracking something in the dream if you\ndo careful analyses that just does not\nseem to hold up there is some evidence\nthat that may be the case\nbut your eyes are moving back and forth\nit seems that these are impulses that\nare going to your eyes that don't have a\nstrong correlation with what it is that\nyou're dreaming visually in the scene\nthat's that's not the case but that's a\nlittle bit of a definition of what\ndreaming is and also when dreaming\noccurs I should probably note by the way\nthat we human beings we seem to be\nspecial in our REM sleep dreaming\namounts now I've just done a little bit\nof a slight of hand when I say REM sleep\nI'm going to infer that it's dreaming\nbut Charles nun um wonderful scientist\nhas looked at the proportion of REM\nsleep across different mammals and what\nhe found was that we human beings are a\ncomplete anomaly when it comes to our\nrelative amounts of REM sleep in other\nwords our dream\nsleep he found that across most other\nprimates REM sleep was usually averaging\nabout 9% of the sleep\nperiod however we human beings on\naverage including When We're Young will\nhave a REM sleep proportion of about 20%\nso if you plot the amount of REM sleep\nof primates in a graph they're all sort\nof clustered around this mean and then\nall of a sudden on the our right hand\nside you've got this one single data\npoint that sticks out that's us human\nbeings and we don't fully understand why\nit is that we have such exceptional\namounts of REM sleep now I've done a lot\nof hand waving and written some theories\nabout why that is but it's still it's\nstill very\nunclear the other thing and that's a\nvery I I can go very philosophical about\nthe functions of REM sleep and how it\nchanged as we made the transition as a\nspecies from tree to ground because\ndon't forget as we mentioned in one of\nour episodes when you're hanging like a\nbird on a tree or you're resting on a\nbranch as a primate up in the trees and\nyou go into REM sleep you lose muscle\ntone so it's quite a fragile state when\nyou're 30 foot up in the air and you've\ngot um gravity desperately wanting to\nbring you and your your limbs down to\nthe ground but when we made the\ntransition down from tree to ground we\nno longer had to worry about that did\nthat open up the opportunity for more\nREM sleep to occur and that explains why\nwe human beings have that we don't know\nREM sleep however does seem to be quite\nfundamental and fundamental from a life\nnecessary perspective there were some\nstudies done back in the 1980s and there\nare studies that have not really been\nreplicated and I I think I agree as to\nwhy because ethically and and you know\nthey're right in that Gray Zone in fact\nfor me I find them quite uncomfortable\nwhen I speak about them or even teach\nthem in class they took rats and they\ndeprived them of sleep totally and what\nthey found was that Rats on average will\ndie somewhere between about 13 to 17\ndays after total sleep deprivation in\nother\nwords rats will die almost as quickly\nfrom sleep deprivation as they will from\nfood deprivation it's that that\nessential brutal but then they did\nsomething different they said well what\nabout the different stages of sleep so\nthey selectively deprived them of either\nnon-rem sleep and REM\nsleep the hypothesis was perhaps that\nnon-rm sleep is from an evolutionary\nperspective a much older form of sleep\nthe first stage of sleep that came into\nbeing was non-rm sleep and the way we\nanswer that is we look across philogyny\nand these sort of different branches and\nwhat we find is that in insects and in\nreptiles amphibians and\nfish they all seem to have non-rem sleep\nbut for the most part with a few\nexceptions they don't seem to have REM\nsleep but if you look at birds and\nmammals they do have REM sleep and in\nfact it seems as though REM sleep\nevolved twice independently once in\nBirds once in mammals which tells us\nprobably that it it's essential if it's\nbeing forced through the evolutionary\npipe twice\nindependently so you would argue well if\nI selectively deprived you of nonr the\nolder stage of sleep presumably that's\nmore life support necessary and REM\nsleep REM sleep is the new kid on the\nBlock\nevolutionarily they found the opposite\nthey found that if they selectively\ndeprive rats just of non-rem sleep they\ndid die but it took them longer they\ndied after about 60 days if you deprive\nthem of REM sleep dream sleep they died\nafter 40 days versus 60 days other words\nthis this new type of sleep REM sleep\nseems to be on that basis maybe even\nmore important to supporting life than\nnon-r sleep it's super interesting and\nas I recall from graduate school there\nare certain patterns of brain activity\nthat occur during a rapid eye movement\nsleep um maybe we could go a little bit\ndeeper into those patterns of activity I\nknow you touched on some of these\npatterns in the first EP episode um the\nthing that comes to mind here is PG\nwaves pwns geniculate occipital um pwns\nbeing an area of the brain stem that is\nchocka block full of different neurons\ninvolved in basic functions rhythmic\nbreathing um eye movements um and basic\nreflexive functions that preserve the\nthe well-being and life of the animal\nand that the neurons there then um do\nindeed connect to the thalamus this is\nlike egg like a shaped structure in the\nmiddle of the brain where you have\nsomething called the geniculate which is\na uh there's a auditory geniculate and a\nand a visual geniculate but it projects\nto this relay station for vision mainly\nand hearing and then it goes up to the\noccipital lobe the area in the back of\nour brain that incited people as\nresponsible for conscious perception of\nimages and I was taught and I don't know\nif this is um still true uh that based\non the work of people like um mer stad\nand um folks like that that these Pon\ngeniculate occipital waves of activity\nthat were ongoing during sleep I think\nduring REM sleep um were essential for\nresetting uh something essential about\nbrain function and wakefulness so that\nyou needed these pggo waves and that\nmaybe even the activation of the visual\npathway was part of the reasons why we\num often experience such robust uh\nvisual hallucinations during dreams um\nwhat is thought about PG\nare they related to rapid eye movement\nsleep and um are they somehow the reset\num that we need um and indeed is\nessential for life because as you\npointed out in the absence of rapid eye\nmovement sleep we\ndie it's a great demonstration of the\nuniqueness of your brain I mean\nessentially what we're asking is um this\nis your brain on dreams explain and REM\nsleep has many different brain features\nto it the first of which is as we spoke\nin the first episode your electrical\nbrain wave activity at the top of the\nbrain the cortex looks almost identical\nto that which you have when you're awake\nwhich is stunning because you're not\nconscious you're lying completely still\nno presence of muscle tone whatsoever\nyet your brain seems to be just as on\nfire with electrical activity as it is\nwhen you're\nawake coming down a step though there\nare these unique pulses of electrical\nalmost like lightning bursts that come\nup from the brain stem up to this\nsensory relay Center in your brain\ncalled the thalamus and then they were\ninitially recorded out in the back of\nthe brain in the visual cortex hence\nthis pgo waves describes the three sites\nthat I've just mentioned goes from the\nbrain stem the ponds up to the thalamus\na part of it called the geniculate and\nthen out to the back of the brain called\nthe ocip cortex\npgo what they found was that those\nbursts of pgo wave activity were very\nmuch linked to these rapid eye movements\nso once you got this burst of a pgo wave\num this sort of brain Stam up into the\nbrain burst then you got one of these\nrapid eye movements so it was linking\nsomething there with the eye movements\nand I told you that when you're having\nthese eye movements that's a state where\nthere's a high probability of dreaming\nand is it a surprise then that the final\ndestination of that lightning bolt where\nit sort of strikes is at the back of the\nbrain in the visual cortex probably not\nthere's also been some links with those\nPJ waves and\nlearning not so much that those pgo\nwaves seem to consolidate memories in\nother words they may not be critical for\nsleep after learning but they seem to be\nrelated almost to sleep and initial\nlearning and the more that animals learn\nthe greater the amount of pgo wave\nactivity they have when they go to\nsleep so pjo waves are unique PJ waves\ndon't simply just hit the back of your\nbrain that we've now measured them in\nall sorts of different cortical areas\nand they seem to light up the lightning\nsplits as it were and it strikes all\nsorts of cortical areas so then the\nquestion was well let's take humans and\nlet's put them inside of brain scanners\nlet's allow them to fall into REM sleep\nand then we'll start scanning the\nbrain what did we find it was very\ninteresting when you look at the brain\nduring REM sleep compared to let's say\nnon-rem sleep you see motor regions of\nthe brain lighting up you see visual\nregions of the brain lighting up just as\nwe described you see memory related\nstructures lighting up like the\nhippocampus and you see emotional\nrelated structures like the amydala and\nsomething called the anterior uh cortex\nuh the anterior singular cortex I should\nsay so if I were to just show you an\nexpert a brain Imaging map with memory\ncenters related uh in terms of their\nactivity emotion centers visual centers\nmotoric centers and I were to say to you\nAndrew this is a scan that we got from\nan individual just describe the type of\nexperience that you think this this\nperson was having in the scanner you\nwould probably look at it and say well\nthey were probably recollecting things\nfrom their past memory structures they\nseem to be having a visual experience\nbut there was also probably movement\ninvolved in that brain scanning\nexperiment and also there seems to be\nsome degree of emotionality to\nit that\nsounds strikingly similar to what we\nknow dreams are like with one exception\nthough and another part of the brain\nbucked the trend of increased activation\nduring REM sleep that part of the brain\nwith a far left and right sides of your\nfrontal lobe something that we call the\ndorsal lateral prefrontal cortex\nterrible mouthful of word salad\nessentially just means the far left and\nright sides of your prefrontal cortex\nthose are very important for logical\nrational thinking and decision making\nthose parts of the brain went down in\ntheir activity almost as though they\nwere suppressed during REM sleep\ndreaming so now let's go back to our map\nyou're having a visual experience it's\nfilled with movement and memories and\nemotions but it's utterly bizarre\ncompletely illogical and totally\nirrational if that's not a perfect\nneural definition of this thing called\nDreaming I don't know what is it's so\ninteresting we think of dreams or at\nleast I think of dreams as a\nfragmented representation of real world\nexperiences from our recent past maybe\neven the previous day you know sort of\nmeshed with um our distant past\nexperience and then of course our brain\nis also a very good anticipatory machine\nand somehow you know puts that into a\nmovie that um for all purposes when\nwe're in it we feel as if it's happening\nin real time yeah then of course uh we\ntry and untangle what the meaning of all\nthat is uh I think people are really\nintrigued by dreams um because they're\nthey just feel so real to us and yet we\nknow they're not of the same real that\nis our waking experience and um and you\nknow throughout history people have um\nalluded to the idea or have been\nconvinced of the idea that dreams are\nmeaningful and something we're going to\nget into and I I should mention by the\nway that your dreams based on those\nbrain pain scans still remained your own\nyou were the only person privy to the\nexperience of the dream itself I could\nstick you in a scanner and I could say\nyou know were you having a visual dream\nand was it you know filled with motor\nactivity and emotions and memories that\ntells me how you're dreaming it doesn't\ntell me what you're dreaming so at that\npoint you still had this degree of\nsecurity in privacy\nno longer it seems there was a great\nstudy done by a Japanese group using\nvery Advanced Brain imaging technology\nand techniques such as multivoxel\npattern analysis again word salad but\nit's a very clever technique and they\nwere able to start to understand exactly\nwhat you Andrew huberman were dreaming\nand they would know what you were\ndreaming even before you woke up and\ntold us what you were dreaming and they\ndid a two-part experiment first they\nshowed you lots of very specific images\nimages of cars of women of houses of men\nof dogs of cats of just a whole category\nof different visual elements and your\nbrain was being scanned as you were\nawake watching each of these and then\nusing this clever analysis they were\nable to build up this very specific\npattern this very specific template of\nactivity that for you Andrew huberman\nsaid he is now looking specifically at a\nset of keys or he was looking at a car\nor he was looking at a woman or a man or\na house and we knew ground truth in\nterms of what your brain looks like when\nit is seeing these different categories\nand then they did something clever then\nthey let those individuals sleep and go\ninto sleep and then they started waking\nthem up and getting dream reports but\nonce they got the dream reports the\nanalysis sort of Team remained blind to\nthose reports what they did was almost\nlike a forensic team that goes hunting\nfor DNA at a crime scene they had the\nDNA and they started going around and\nsearching to see if they could find a\nDNA match but here they weren't using\nthe DNA they were using these templates\nof a woman's face or a car or a house\nand they would search through this\nelectrical this brain activity sort of\nstatic of your dreams at night and find\nthese matches and then we could wake you\nup get the dream report and see how well\ndid our brain performing a sort of\nalgorithm match with your actual\nsubjective report when you came out and\nit was stunning how close so I could\ntell you were dreaming but you were also\ndreaming about a house and a car you're\ndreaming about a woman turns out and we\nstarted to want your dreams as I said\nwere your own but\nnow no longer because science can start\nto reveal those what we can't yet do is\nunderstand which specific woman in which\nspecific house so what you would\nprobably see my brain based on my uh own\nproclivities lighting up is it would\njust be full of cars probably sports\ncars and then maybe another special uh\nindividual woman those two things would\nbe dominant but you wouldn't know that\nI'm dreaming about the new Porsche\n911 GT2 RS you can't tell that you can\njust simply tell me he was dreaming\nabout a car so there is still some\ndistance to go I can't help but ask\nbased on what you just described when\npeople say things in their dreams when\nthey sleep talk um how Faithfully does\nthat report what's in the dream it\ndoesn't at all and the reason is because\nwhen you sleep talking or sleep walking\nor even sleep eating you're not dreaming\nbecause you're not in dream sleep this\nis one of the fallacies that\nsleepwalking or sleeptalking you're you\nknow stop dreaming wake up you're\ndreaming you're waking someone out of\nthe very depths of deep non-rm sleep and\nthese different things sleep walking\nsleep talking sleep eating um sleep um\nthere's sleep Associated sex behavior\nall of these things are what we call\nparasomnias Par meaning sort of around\nsomnia obviously sleep so these are\nthings that happen around sleep but\nthey're not quite in sleep because when\nyou have those you are launched from\nDeep non-rm Sleep up to wakefulness but\nyou don't make it all the way to\nwakefulness and so you act out these\nvery rote routine reflexive behaviors\nyou just repeat certain words you lift a\ncup to your mouth go over to the\nrefrigerator\nso they are not faithful to the dream\nbecause if I were to gently wake you as\nyou're sleeptalking and say what was\ngoing through your head you'll say\nnothing at all and you don't report a\ndream I'd like to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that\nalso can contains adaptogens and is\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs by now\nI'm sure you've all heard me say that\nI've been taking ag1 since 2012 and\nindeed that is true now of course I do\nconsume regular Whole Foods every day I\nstrive to get those Foods mostly from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources however I do find it hard to get\nenough servings of fruits and vegetables\neach day so with ag1 I ensure that I get\nenough of the vitamins minerals\nPrebiotic fiber and other things\ntypically found in fruits or vegetables\nand of course I still make sure to eat\nfruits and vegetables and in that way\nprovide a sort of insurance that I'm\ngetting enough of what I need in\naddition the adaptogens and other\nmicronutrients in ag1 really help buffer\nagainst stress and ensure that the cells\nand organs and tissues of my body are\ngetting the things they need people\noften ask me that if they were going to\ntake Just One supplement what that\nsupplement should be and I always answer\nag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go\nto drink a1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer you'll get five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman earlier in this series You\ndescrib Beautiful experiments by Matt\nWilson others at MIT um who explored\nneural activity within the brain within\nthe hippocampus in particular an area\nassociated with memory\nformation in which the\nneurons in the hippocampus fire in the\nsame sequence as they did during a\nparticular daytime activity that\npreceded that night's sleep but they do\nso at a much more rapid rate sometimes\nthey play in Reverse Etc yeah um this\nraises the question of first of all is\nthat sort of neural replay of events\nfrom the prior day is that also\nassociated with Dreaming or more\nspecifically is that Dreaming or is\ndreaming that and that's really to raise\nthe larger question which is what is\ndreaming for what is the function of\ndreaming so what we know is that Matt\nWilson's data during nonrapid ey mve and\nsleep the brain was replaying those\nmemories 10 to 20 times faster\nso but when you go into REM sleep it's\ndown to 0 five times so listening to\nthis podcast now and you hit that speed\nbutton and you drop it down to 0.5 that\nseems to be the replay speed during REM\nsleep we've not yet been able to confirm\nthat in human beings but if we did does\nthat mean we can explain the time time\ndifferences that seem to happen in the\ndream state that time is longer in the\ndream world than it is in the waking\nworld I think that's\nfascinating but you're right it does\npoint us more towards the question\nthough of what are the functions of this\nstate called Dreaming and we can get on\nto whether or not dreaming is a very\nfaithful recapitulation of our waking\nexperiences and I'll give you a spoiler\nnow\nno but I'll give you the data in a\nsecond but the functions of dreaming\ncome back to some of the functions of\nREM sleep that we described in an\nearlier episode those two related\nfunctions in the episode on learning in\nmemory um was that one function of REM\nsleep seems to be creativity associating\nmemories together so that you can come\nup with these wonderfully Divine\nsolutions to problems you couldn't\nanswer when you're awake the second came\nin our last episode about emotional and\nmental wellness and we spoke about this\ntheory that we put forward that REM\nsleep is a form of overnight therapy and\nwe described the evidence supporting\nthat\ntherapy so I would say that those are\nthe two leading theories of REM sleep\nand Associated dreaming but I perhaps\ndidn't give you the full story there\nthere is a Twist in both of those\nstories I told you that when you are in\nREM sleep and you're dreaming the next\nday you are better able to assimilate\nand Associate memories and come up with\nthese creative Insight\nSolutions it turns out that sleep is\nnecessary for that and not just sleep\nbut dream related sleep REM sleep is\nnecessary for that but it's not\nsufficient you not only have to be\nasleep and dreaming to get those\nbenefits you also have to be dreaming of\nthe very things\nthat you are trying to solve the next\nday there's a great study by a scientist\ncalled Robert stick gold at Harvard and\nhe had a whole group of individuals\nlearn a virtual Maze and they were\ndropped down in different locations of\nthe Maze and they had to try to get out\nof the Maze and gradually when you're\ndropped down in different locations you\ndo that enough times you start to build\nup this mental map of the Maze and then\nhe let one half of those participants\ntake a 9 minute nap and the other half\nremained awake and then some hours later\nthey tested them on the Maze and they\nmeasured how quickly were you able to\nnavigate and get out of the maze that\nwas the outcome measure and sure enough\njust as we described those people who\nslept versus those who didn't they were\nbetter able to navigate The Maze after\nthey had slept versus those who remained\nawake but then they went back and they\nseparated those individuals who were\nnapping into two classes because as they\nwere napping they were waking them up\nintermittently and getting dream reports\nfrom them and what they found was that\nthose people who slept and still had\ndream reports but those dreams were not\nrelated to The Maze they didn't show an\nimprovement but those individuals who\nslept and who dreamt but also dreamt of\nthe specific maze elements themselves\nthey were the only subset of people of\nparticipants who showed the benefit and\nthat's a beautiful demonstration that\nyes you need to sleep to get creative\nbenefits and in fact seemingly have\ndream sleep but you also need to be\ndreaming about specific\nthings is that rule true for the second\nfunction of REM sleep dreaming this\novernight therapy benefit yes it does\nseem to be true there were some great\nStudies by a scientists who sadly passed\naway now Rosaline cartright and she was\nlooking at different patient populations\nwho had undergone really painful\ndifficult emotional experiences for\nexample a very bitter painful\ndivorce and she would at the time that\nthose individuals were going through\nthis difficult challenge she would be\nrecording their sleep looking at their\ndifferent stages of sleep and she was\ncollecting dream reports from them and\nthen she would track them and their\nprogression clinically over the next\nyear and what she found was that some of\nthose participants about 50% of them\nended up getting clinical remission from\nthe depression that was instigated by\nthe painful experience they'd gone\nthrough the other half did not get\nclinical remission from their depression\nthey remained depressed and then she\nused those two classes to go back and\nhave a look at the sleep and dream\nreports and what she found was some\ndifferences in REM sleep but more\ninterestingly were the differences in\nthe dreams both of those sets of\nindividuals were dreaming at the time of\ngoing through those difficult emotional\nexperiences some of them however were\ndreaming of that challenging experience\nothers were not those who dreamt but\nalso dreamt of the problematic\nexperience were the ones who went on to\nget clinical resolution from their\ndepression those who dreamed but did not\ndream of those events seem to be the\nones who did not get clinical remission\nfrom their depression in other words\nhere once again is this new rule that\nwhen it comes to Dreaming it's not just\nabout sleep and it's not just about\ndreaming it's about dreaming of the\nspecific things that you're trying to\nget the functional benefit from whether\nthat's creativity and insight or whether\nit's emotional resolution and over night\ntherapy both of them seem to depend very\nmuch on the expression of dreaming of\nspecific things itself and we'll come on\nto why that's maybe relevant when we\nspeak about Lucidity too what you just\nsaid is very reassuring at least to me\nbecause uh when I'm going through a\nchallenging phase um which somehow seems\nto happen periodically in my life at a\nfrequency that uh let's just say keeps\nme dreaming um about things um You're\nNot Alone by the way I'm sure I'm not\nwhich is no no I didn't mean that I just\nmean that there are lots of people who\ncan resonate with that so thank you for\nbeing vulnerable and sharing yeah yeah\nit's um one of these things where I you\nknow put my head down on the pillow fall\nasleep and um on you know assuming I can\nget good sleep amidst those those real\nlife events which is something that um\nsometimes is the case sometimes is not I\nalways dream about things related to\nthose events or those events in\nparticular and I'm a longtime\npractitioner of of um writing down my\ndreams when I wake up from them um or as\nwe discussed in an earlier episode I'll\num my phone is on airplane mode at night\ntypically I'll grab my phone and I'll\nhit the voice memo um button yeah or\nfunction rather and I'll just you know\nin my groggy state with my eyes closed\nso I'm not getting any light in my eyes\nI'll say you know I'll describe what I\ncan recall of the dream then I'll\nsometimes go back and listen to those um\nthose recordings and they've provided me\nInsight um\nand in some cases a path to Solutions so\nI'm 100% on board the fact that our\ndreams can help us resolve challenges in\nour waking day what's always fascinating\nto me though is how the dreams are not a\none forone representation of what\nhappened during the day it's you know I\nthink symbolism is a is a is a Hallmark\nfeature of of dreams you know um and\nthat's uh something I know we're going\nto talk about you know in terms of dream\ninterpretation and much has been made of\nthis um throughout history um so it\nseems that when we're asking what are\nthe functions of dreaming one of them is\nto resolve uh challenges from our\ndaytime experience um it's emotional\nfirst aid yeah that's beautifully put\nand in an earlier episode on learning\nmemory and creativity you uh described\nhow specific sleep stages and perhaps\ndreams themselves are involved in the\nconsolidation of of memories from\ndaytime experiences or things that we're\ntrying try to learn from daytime\nexperiences and then in the episode on\nsleep and emotions it was made very\nclear that rapid eye movement sleep is a\ntime in which we get a a sort of um\ntherapy that is a disentangling of the\nemotional load of a given experience\nfrom The Experience um so to me it just\nseem so clear like dreams are critical\nsleep is critical but I think one\nquestion that Still Remains unresolved\nat least for me is are dreams really\nthere to just be a replay our waking\nlives with some Distortion because when\nthe conscious mind is asleep the\nunconscious mind can kind of throw\nthings up to the surface in ways that U\nyou know don't seem so obvious like you\nknow symbolism analogy some of us are\nmore visual than others um you know are\nthere any rules about the way that\ndreams convert our waking experiences\ninto dream content there are and the\nshort answer to your question do we\nsimply go into sleep start dreaming and\nthen rewind the videotape and Replay in\na faithful\nrecapitulation the waking day in our\ndreaming night and the answer is no and\nhere again uh the scientist I mentioned\nbefore Robert stickgold um with uh raw\nfossy they looked at this question and\nit was a very difficult study to do they\ndid what we call experience sampling\nduring the day\nand they would give you sort of like a\nlittle beeper and they would set it to\ngo off multiple times throughout the day\nand then you would write down what it is\nthat you were experiencing right in that\nmoment and again they were trying to\nbuild up this sort of time lapse\nphotography as it were of your waking\nday experience and then they would bring\npeople in and they would start to record\ntheir dreams at night and then they\nwould match those two and ask what is\nthe degree of overlap what is the ven\ndiagram proportion or percentage of\nthose two things aligning and what they\nfound was that there was really only\nabout\n2% of your dreaming life that was a very\nfaithful replay and reiteration of your\nWaking\nLife however what they did find was\nsomething even more interesting to me\nwhich comes back to this idea of\novernight therapy they found that there\nis something that runs through like a\nred thread narrative from your Waking\nLife into your dreaming life that is\nemotional concerns and people of\nsignificance if there is anything in\nterms of an algorithm that seems to\noverlap and predict where those two vend\ndiagrams sort of collide it really is in\nthe emotional personal significance\nspace once again pointing us to perhaps\na re\naffirmation that a key function of\ndreaming is about dealing with our\nwaking experiences and particularly the\nthings that are Salient to us okay so\nclearly there's a functionality to\nDreaming but what should we make of the\nspecific content of our dreams really\nmeaning should we interpret our dreams\nor should we allow anyone else to\ninterpret our dreams there are scores of\nbooks out there websites programs\nthere's a long history of this in\nclassic\npsychoanalysis what about this dream\ninterpretation\nbusiness I mean it really started you\nhave to give credit in some ways to\nFreud although if you look back at very\nancient cultures so much of their\nartwork so much of the sort of left\nimprint on the world suggests that they\nwere fascinated by dreams and use dreams\nand gods of dreams so we've always been\nthinking about what are these things\ncalled dreams and can we interpret them\nbut it was really Freud who put his\nseminal works together in\n1899 and then published it in\n1901 um called the interpretation of\ndreams and it's probably one of his if\nnot his most famous text\nand you can unfairly sum it up as um you\nknow if it's not one thing it's your\nmother when it comes to to Freud but in\nsome ways Freud with his interpretation\nattempt in my mind was 50% right and a\n100%\nwrong because until the moment that\nFreud came\nalong we left the interpretation and the\ninstigation of our dreams to things\noutside of us maybe it was there were\ncomments that it was due to our soul or\nit was from the gods on high that they\nwould descend down these these dream\nmanifestos to us but Freud full credit\nwas the first person to put dreams front\nand center into this thing called the\nbrain the mind so in some ways Freud\nshifted dream science from really more\nof a sort of spiritual\nphilosophical you know condition to very\nmuch a\nneuroscience it was of the mind and\ntherefore of the brain and earlier he\nhad he had tried to describe the neural\npatterns and he had these beautiful\ndrawings of neuronal circuits that could\ntry to explain what was going on but\nNeuroscience was so anemic at the time\nin terms of its knowledge he had no\nchance to do what we can do now so in\nsome ways it's very unfair of me to\ncriticize him as his theory being\nnon-scientific it is also non-scientific\nin the very strict sense of the word\nwhen we create create a scientific\ntheory just as though he created his\ninterpretation of Dreams\nTheory we allow that theory to be\ntestable which is to say that a\nscientific theory is only a scientific\ntheory if it can be falsified or\nsupported but Freud's theory was not a\nscientific theory it was not something\nthat you could test and therefore it was\nnot\nable to be falsified or affirmed and in\nsome ways it was\nFreud's simultaneous downfall and his\nutter genius it's the reason that Freud\nremains to this day because we we can't\nput him in way in a box and say we've\ndisproven him but we equally will never\nbe able to prove him and therefore he's\nbeen in some ways let go in hard science\nas being representative\nhis theory which we don't need to get\ninto which was um called disguised\ncensorship was really a very\ninteresting proposition which was that\nthere was something about our dreams\nthat was veiled and masked and Freud\nbelieved that he understood the\ndecryption code to our dreams and if you\ntell him your dream he has the special\nfilter that he can pull that dream\nthrough the filter and magically out on\nthe other side is the true meaning of\nthat\ndream there are several problems with\nthat uh Theory not least of which I\nthink you know at the time if you look\nat his writings it seemed that Freud was\nprobably doing enough cocaine to kill a\nsmall horse at the time but we'll put\nthat aside for a second uh the the issue\nthere is that it's not very replicable\nas an analysis method and there was a\nfascinating um study that was I remember\nfrom a conference I I should check to\nsee if it's been fully published and\nthey did something clever they took the\nFreudian method and they took a single\nDream from one individual and they had\nthree Freudian\npsychoanalysts analyze that dream so it\nwas the same dream but three different\nanalysts now in a scientific protocol if\nit's a scientifically rigorous\nassessment tool you would get back the\nvery same answer from that measure\nmement technique all three times or very\nsimilar so for example a carbon dating\nmachine if I were to take a fossil and\nput it in a carbon dating machine and\nthen another another one and another one\nfor the most part they're probably going\nto return something that's much more\nsimilar than different in terms of the\ncarbon date of that fossil why because\nit's been very well validated and\nreplicated that's what you want from a\nscientific method and Tool but when they\ngave this single dream the f as it were\nto these three different interpreters\nthe three different carbon dating\nmachines as it were they all came up\nwith completely different\ninterpretations and so that's not\nnecessarily a reliable valid method so\nin that sense we've abandoned and let go\nof Freud as being relevant or\nmeaningful however I personally and I\nthink if you look at the\ndata I don't mean that to suggest that\nyou should not try to think about and\nquote unquote interpret your dreams and\nthe term interpret when it comes to\ndreams is so loaded so I tend to I would\njust simply say see if you can\nreally deconstruct some of your dreams I\nthink dreaming just as we've spoken\nabout is a very solid window into the\nthings that you should be concerned\nabout from your Waking Life it's very\nobvious that what whatever it is that we\ntypically dream are the things that our\nbrain is telling us the human being this\nis the stuff that's essential this is\nthe stuff you need to work through this\nis please pay attention to me and any\namount of journaling or deliberation\ndigestion citation of that specific\ndream is going to be beneficial to you\nbecause in my mind a life unexamined is\nnot a life life well lived and that\nisn't just applicable to your Waking\nLife it's especially applicable to your\ndreaming life now does that mean I\nsuggesting that everyone should race out\nand start cataloging and and uh\ninterpreting their dreams not\nnecessarily but I am saying that if you\nwish to do that I as a scientist based\non the data I'm not telling you that\nthat's whoy and non-scientific I think\nit's very valid it's just that some of\nthe Freudian principles I think we've\nbeing able to dislocate ourselves from I\nwholeheartedly agree with what you just\nsaid um and I've spoken about dreams and\ntheir possible relevance to clinician\npsychiatrist such as Paul KY and others\num some who have more of a\npsychoanalytic training than others but\ncertainly folks like Paul um know a ton\nof Neuroscience they understand\npharmacology they understand family\nsystems models uh dialectical uh therapy\nand so many other man is he's\nextraordinary\nhe's not extraordinary he's\nextraordinary he is extraordinary and um\nin part because he can synthesize across\nall these different domains of\nPsychiatry psychology Neuroscience Etc\nas opposed to just be existing in one\nSilo like psychoanalysis or um or\npsychopharmacology so and there are\nothers um although few as um as as\nextraordinary as Paul which is why we\nhosted him on the series here and one of\nthe things that has come up in the\ndiscussions with Paul and others um with\nsimilar training about dreams is\nthat dreams seem to present us with\nemotional states and scenarios for which\nthere's a lot of um swapping in and out\nof of identity so for instance the\nnotion of symbols within dreams is a\nlong-standing conversation and I think\none of the mistakes as I understand it\nis to assume that every time there's an\nanimal in your dream that it represents\nchildren or that every time it's a\nparticular kind of animal it represents\nyou know uh you know your boss or\nsomething right sometimes a cigar is\njust a cigar right right uh on the other\nhand it's very clear that within our\ndreams there's rarely a completely\nlinear one forone relationship with what\nhappened in the daytime um of real\nexperience so there seems to be a\nswapping in and out and there I just\nsort of zoom out and forgive me for\ngoing long here but I think um this\nwould be a good fod for for exploring\nthis a bit more deeply you know one of\nthe best um descriptions of brain\nfunction that I've ever heard is from\nthe Nobel prize winning neuroscientist\nRichard Axel at Columbia who often talks\nabout the brain creating abstractions of\nthe outside world so if I were to take a\nphoto of your face for instance and then\nshow you that photograph you'd say yeah\nthat's me but if I Were A Painter I\nmight um you know swap some of the\npositions of of um components of your\nface and show it to you and you might\nsay well that doesn't look like me and\nI'd say but that's my abstraction of\nyour face so to me it makes sense\nbecause I understand the rules by which\nI made those swaps and moves there's\nsome algor gorithms or rules that are\nare known to me so there's a s\npreservation of real world to the\nabstraction and that's really what our\nbrain does all the time it attempts to\nFaithfully represent the the uh the\nworld around us but it is indeed an\nabstraction and when it comes to the\ncolors of things or the position of\nobjects it's as one for one as our brain\nis capable of um but when it comes to\nideas to feelings to our relationships\nto other people the brain abstracts\nthose in a in its own little neural\nSymphony of this is the relationship to\nmy dog this is the relationship to my\nfriend and colleague Matt Walker so it\nmakes sense that in dreams those\nalgorithms could be different they could\nbe faster or slower um but they could\nalso be entirely different and I don't\nthink we yet know what the algorithms of\ntransformation of real world experience\nto dream experience are and once we do\nand I think somebody we will understand\nthose through electrical recordings and\nMRI type um uh experiments and some of\nthe experiments you talked about earlier\npoint to this and so I think it's\nentirely reasonable to assume that we\neach have our own unique abstraction\nalgorithms so that indeed we can have\nconsistent representation of real world\nexperiences in symbols but that it's not\ngoing to be the same for everybody\ncorrect right your way of abstracting\nyour real life to your dream life could\nbe entirely unique to you and mine could\nbe entirely unique to me making it very\ndifficult for a third party to come in\nand say okay Matt here's what your dream\nmeans but you can know what your dream\nmeans if you explore your dreams over\ntime not just that one dream does that\nmake sense it makes total sense because\nin some ways there is no one who knows\nyour own\nautobiography by definition than you\nthan yourself now I'm not suggesting\nthat having that interpretation Guided\nby someone who also understands the\nemotional problems that you're having\nand also sees your blind spots which is\nwhat a really good therapist can do can\nthen help with that interpretation but\nyou're right because my representation\nof information in the brain is going to\nbe very biased by also what I've\nexperienced in the past and how that\npast experience augments and modulates\nthe current representation of that\ninformation and thus the meaning of it\nfor me the unique\nindividual and you're also right to say\nthat it's\nsomehow you know it's almost as though\nyou're squ inting your eyes when you're\nin dream sleep in terms of the true\nvision of things things get a little bit\nwacky and distorted this bizarre nature\nWe There is some very interesting data\nand it comes back to what we described\nearlier the neurochemistry of the REM\nsleep State I told you that during REM\nsleep levels of neur adrenaline are at\nFlor levels neur adrenaline is shut off\none of the things if you sort of drop\nneur adrenaline onto neural Circ\nit will very much increase what we call\nthe signal to noise and this is why\nnoradrenaline when it's released or if\nyou administer it to an animal you can\nbecome very you can become almost um\nmore directed you're much more Divergent\nyou're focused in attending and it's\nreally there you're very blinkered\nyou're very focused but when that goes\naway the neural circuits become a little\nbit more Loosey Goosey and I also told\nyou that the other chemical if there is\na neurochemical that defines REM sleep\ndreaming it's this thing called\nacetycholine and acetycholine seems to\ndo the opposite it seems to inject a\nlittle bit more noise relative to the\nsignal so in other words your brain\ncircuits are neurochemically modulated\nwhen you dream to inject almost what we\nwould think of as fuzzy logic and this\nis why I think the analogy that we spoke\nabout in a previous epe episode holds\nthat when you are awake and you're given\nsome information you produce the most\nobvious links and obvious associations\nbecause you're very much blinkered and\nyou have nor adrenaline on board but\nwhen you go into dream sleep the it's\nalmost like the Google search when\nyou're awake you go straight to page one\nand it's very related but do that same\nsearch when you're in the dream state\nand it you know you go straight to page\nyou know 35\nand it's an utterly bizarre page and you\nthink hang on a second this got nothing\nto do with the search term when you read\nit you think well a squint my eyes kind\nof does it's very distant very\nnon-obvious but that's a very smart\nconnection that as a waking brain I\nnever would have put together so I think\nneurochemically we can start to\nunderstand it but I think this is a very\ngood important Point were you could\nalmost say the very best

my\nlife um it's I won't share what it is um\nit's not a real world experience or at\nleast it's not a one for one of real\nworld experience but I've had this\nnightmare since I was a kid I have it\nseldom these days but every time it\nstarts again I'm like oh no and there's\na bit of Lucidity to it where I'm like I\nhear him again been working on this one\na while um as you can imagine but given\nwhat we understand about the\nrelationship between real world\nexperiences and dreams what should we\nmake of the fact that we have nightmares\nso let's just start there the phenomenon\nof nightmares does it represent\nsomething that troubled Us in the\ndaytime and that we're trying to work\nout in our sleep um and then maybe we\ncan get into some of the specifics\naround\nwhy regardless of whether or not the\nanswer to that question is yes or no\nthat we would have this thing called\nnightmares especially given that there's\nall this Machinery to make sure that we\ndon't move and the nor adrenaline is low\nin the brain While We're Dreaming um\nseems like there's all all sorts of\nmechanisms to try and ensure that our\ndreams are very pleasant or at least\nneutral but um nightmares suck but um so\nI'd love to know me that t-shirt please\nso I'd love to know that they uh serve\nsome utility so nightmares how do we\nDefine a nightmare in sort of science\nclinically it's a little bit tricky but\nusually the way we Define it is it's a\nstrongly unpleasant dream that causes\nsome time of\ndaytime um\ndispleasure so in other words some type\nof daytime dysfunction or\ndistress so everyone can have a bad\ndream but when you go up into your\nWaking Life and about your waking day it\ndoesn't seem to bother you too much and\nmaybe we'll just say that's a bad dream\nwhen it really becomes a nightmare is\nwhen I almost think of it as though you\nwake up and that blanket of strong\nnightmare emotion is still wrapped\naround you and you can feel it you can\njust know that my emotional state is\nstill heavy and I know exactly where it\ncame from and it was from that Nightmare\nand throughout the day you don't seem to\nbe able to drobe yourself from that\ncloaked affect of The Nightmare it\ndrenches you almost that's where it\nreally starts to become unpleasant and\nwe actually do have a clinical category\nit's called nightmare disorder and the\nway we typically Define that is the same\nthing as I said a very unpleasant dream\nthat causes some type of daytime\ndistress and it's happening at least\nonce a week at that point we start to\nmove it into this category of nightmare\ndisorder what are nightmares doing if\nanything at all there are at least two\ntheories one is that it's simply the\nsystem failing the system gone wrong and\nwe're not processing we're not moving\nthrough things and therefore nightmares\nare maladaptive they're not warranted\nthey're not normative the other is that\nno they are adaptive and they are\nmeaningful and it's us really trying to\ngo to a very specific pain point and we\ncontinue to process it over and over\nperhaps to the point where we get\nresolution but sometimes we just don't\nso it keeps cropping\nup we don't have good data to\ndisambiguate those two right now so I\nthink it still remains at least I don't\nknow of any data that tells me are they\nfunctional or are they\nmaladaptive even when we get that answer\nin some ways it doesn't change the fact\nthat it still leaves a patient with\nnightmares with recurring\nnightmares so then what do you do about\nthat how do we is there any treatment\nfor people out there if they're under\nthis distress is there hope and for a\nlong time there really wasn't very much\nhope at all you just had to go through\nit but recently there was a a method\nthat was developed and it's very\neffective and it is called\nIRT which stands for image rehearsal\ntherapy and its basis comes back to\nsomething that in fact we um I think\nhopefully published the first evidence\nand humans of um some years ago now\ncalled memory reconsolidation\nso in our episode on learning and memory\nwe said that there is at least sort of\ntwo main steps of memory first you have\nto imprint and learn the memory lay down\nthat memory Trace but then that memory\nis very fragile and vulnerable to being\noverwritten by competing information\nknocked out of place and for you to hold\non to that memory you have to go through\na second step called memory\nconsolidation a very slow process it's\nlike a very slow pressing of the save\nbutton because it's biological it\nrequires Pro prot synthesis and all of\nthat good stuff but that always struck\nme as a strange model because it's the\nequivalent of opening up a Word document\nyou type out all of the information into\nit and then you hit the save Buton so\nI've encoded imprinted the information\nthat I've hit save and saved it and then\nI close that file and then the next day\nI come back or some days later and I\ndouble click on that file again because\nI want to edit it I either want to add\nto it or I want to revise it and change\nit but according to that model it's been\nlogged in place and you could never edit\nthat word document that seems like a\nprofoundly useless way to store\ninformation and what we learned is that\nevery time in subsequent days when you\nreactivate which is to say when you\nrecollect the memory that has been\nConsolidated it opens that memory file\nback up to once again being plastic and\nmalleable so you can go in and update\nthe information in that memory store and\nthen the next night you consolidate it\nagain in other words you reconsolidate\nit so it's memory updating and there is\na very clear mechanism in the human\nbrain that allows us to do this memory\nupdating iteratively time and time\nagain this comes back to nightmare uh\ndisorders this therapy image rehearsal\ntherapy or IR will have you sit down\nwith a therapist and at first you'll\ndescribe the nightmare that you're going\nthrough and you'll write that narrative\ndown and then working with a therapist\nyou will agree to think about a more\nneutral ending to that that nightmare so\nlet's say that I was involved in a very\num very difficult car crash was just\nhorrific and every night since I'd say\nat least once a week I just continue to\nhave the the nightmare of the car crash\nI know that I'm traveling towards the\njunction I apply the brakes the brakes\nhave failed I am just looking around I'm\ntrying to maneuver but nothing is going\nto change this I go through the red\nlight and someone sideswipes me and\nthat's the end and I relive that time\nand time again and it's awful so you\nwith the therapist or I with a therapist\nwould then start to say well what about\nthe alternative iio I depress The Brak\nand the brakes don't work but gradually\nI think well I'm just going to reach\nover to the handbrake and I'm going to\ngradually apply the handbrake and that\nslowly is going to bring the car to a\nnice safe stop and then I'm going to\ncall the emergency services the car is\ngoing to get towed I don't go through\nthe\njunction I survive everything's\nfine so you rehearse this alternate\nending and you keep going through that\nrehearsing that and then you go to sleep\nthe next night and you'll probably have\na high chance of that nightmare again\nbut if you keep doing that once you've\ngot that alternative ending essentially\nwhat you're trying to do is every time\nyou reactivate the memory of the trauma\ncar crash and then you rehearse this\nalternate ending it's like me going into\nthe word document and editing the\nsection that was really horrific and bad\nand replacing it with something that's\nneutral or even positive and over time\nthen I sleep and I will consolidate that\nmemory I'll come back back the next day\nand I'll do some more editing and more\nupdating and Time After Time After Time\ngradually you dissipate the narrative\nthat is fixed inside of the brain and\nthe nightmare frequency decreases in\nproportion now it's not effective for\n100% of patients if if you look at the\ndata on average it's about two out of\nevery three people so about 66% of\npeople will benefit which if you look at\nsome Medical Treatments that's that's a\ngreat treatment that's still very\neffective there was a very recent study\nfrom um uh Sophie Schwarz and her\ncolleagues at the University of Geneva\nthat did an even more ingenious study\nand they were able to nudge the\neffectiveness of that treatment from 66%\nup to\n92% and they used an additional memory\nrelated research tool we've uh come up\nwith in sleep science and it's called\nTMR or targeted memory reactivation and\nhere's how it goes I'm going to have you\nlearn a set of associations have you\never played that card game I think in\nAmerica it's called memory which is very\napt where you get a deck of cards and it\nhas two of the same items two houses two\ncars two fire engines two cattles and\nyou Shuffle the cards and then you put\nthem face down in a big Square in a big\nMatrix and over time you have to turn\nover one card and it's a kettle and then\nI'm just going to randomly pick another\ncard and it's a fire engine H okay but\ngradually you start to learn where each\none of the purs are\nlocated so what's clever about that is\nwe would do that type of what's called a\nPur Association me memory test you have\nyou you learn these Pur Associates and\nthen we test you after night of sleep\nand you're better however if for as\nyou're turning those items over I play a\ncongruent sound so let's say you turn\nover the fire engine and then when you\nturn over the other fire engine I'm\ngoing to start playing a fire engine\nnoise in the background so I'm bonding\nthe association of the memory card purs\nwith this tone with this congruent sound\nand then a kettle I turn over a kettle I\nturn over the other Kettle and it's\nwhistling and then when you let people\nsleep at night if you start replaying\nthose same tones at a subway sub\nAwakening threshold so you're not waking\npeople up and you bring them back and\nlet's say that you only do those sound Q\nreactivations for half of the memories\nthat you've done and the other half you\nleave untouched so with within an\nindividual you have a unique within\nindividual control you test them on the\nthings that you didn't reactivate at\nnight and those that you\ndid it's almost like uh creating a\nbespoke playlist at night where you say\nlook I learned all of this information\nduring the day or wouldn't this be\nwonderful and then here is the stuff\nthat I really think personally to me I\nwant to remember well it turns out I'd\nbeen tagging that with particular music\nand then at night I replay that music\nand the next day it turns out that those\nthings I reactivated are much more\nstrongly Consolidated by way of sleep\nthan those things I didn't so that's the\nbasic method of what we call TMR\ntargeted memory\nreactivation what they did was something\nvery clever they had them go through\nthis process of the image rehearsal\ntherapy they were rehearsing the\nalternate ending but about every 10\nseconds they were playing them this very\npleasing piano chord in the background\nand they were just bonding the\nassociation of the new outcome ending to\nthe nightmare with this Pleasant piano\nchord and then sure enough in the\nsubsequent weeks afterwards Not only was\nthat person day after day doing the\ndiligent therapy practice of rehearsing\nthe memory whilst the piano tone was\nplaying but then at night they would\nwait until they went into REM sleep\nwhich is the state we think the\nemotional therapy begins and they would\nstart to Replay that same piano chord\nover and over again and sure enough\nthose people who had image rehearsal\ntherapy standard they improved by about\n60% in their nightmare frequency\nreduction those people who did that plus\nthe memory reactivation at night it\ndrove it from 66% all the way up to\n92% so now modern day Neuroscience with\nits techniques is starting to overlap\nwith classical Clinical Psychology and\nwe're developing these next Forefront of\nmethods that really harness and\nfine-tune the brain's ability to undergo\neffective therapy it's incredible I mean\nI think that we've known about classical\nconditioning for a long time and the uh\nyou know the the case of Pavlov's dogs\nis the most you know known of those um\nam I right in recalling that um this\npair dissociation\nway of bringing about certain memories\nor strengthening certain memories in\nsleep can also be accomplished with\nodors um that it's not just the playing\nof tones during specific experiences but\nalso for instance if one were to pair a\nparticular odor with a certain uh novel\nmemory event in the daytime or attempt\nto learn something new that if that odor\nis then infused into the room of the\nsleeping person later that night that\nsomehow the the memories would be\nstrengthened do I have that correct\nthere's nothing wrong I've said it\nbefore I'll say it again nothing wrong\nwith your memory that was one of the\nseminal papers that started this whole\nmovement and what they did was they had\nthem learn this kind of Pur associate\ncard test but they were wearing this\nMass almost looks like a fighter pilot\nmask and they were either puffing up\ninert air that was that didn't smell at\nall or they were perusing this very\npleasant Rose scent because smell in\nparticular has a very unique\nrelationship with our memory in part\nbecause we emerged you know from animals\nthat would principally use smell as\ntheir navigational tool I think everyone\nhas had this experience where you Bond a\ncertain cologne or a certain perfume\nwith a particular individual so they\nwere puffing The Rose perfume up the\nnose of these participants and then when\nthey went into sleep they started to\nreperfuse that Rose odor\nnow what was clever also about the\nexperiment you could say well look just\nanytime you get something that smells\npuffed up your nose your memory is going\nto be better now the initial experiment\nhad them learning the information when\nthey're awake with the rose scent\ngetting pushed up the nose and then when\nthey slept they had the rose odor again\nanother group did had learning but they\nhad no rose smell pushed up their nose\nto bond with the information at the time\nof learning when they were awake and\nthen when they slept they also had Rose\nodor stuffed up their nose and they\nshowed no additional benefit so it's not\njust enough to have Rose odor at night\nyou need to have made the initial bonded\nfamiliar connection with the novel\ninformation that you're learning to get\nthe subsequent targeted memory\nreactivation benefit and you could then\nthink well practical tools what should I\ndo maybe you know when I'm learning for\nstudying for a test I should blaze up my\nyou know my most preferred incense and\nI'm I have a particular proclivity to\ngreen tea incense it turns out and maybe\nthen before I go to bed at night I get a\ncouple of sticks and I you know Blaze\nthem back up took my head on the pillow\nturn the light out however do not do\nthat because it's probably a desperate\nfire hazard so do not listen to me but\nyou could think about doing something\nalong those lines perhaps anyway um so\nthat's targeted memory reactivation yeah\num it's a perf segue for what I wanted\nto talk about next which is lucid\ndreaming um but um before we move to\nlucd Dreaming I'm wondering whether or\nnot there's a an opportunity here to\nconstruct an experiment maybe even a\nprotocol of sorts to\nuncouple the negative experience of\nnightmares to our daily experience could\nyou so for instance we're talking about\npair dissociation based on odors or\nsound replayed in sleep to um sort of\nnudge um or conjure particular daytime\nmemories to the surface in the form of\ndream sleep yeah but we also know that\none can uncouple um associations so for\ninstance um if one experienced something\nnegative and maybe this is being\nattempted in the in the realm of of\ntrauma therapy um and that experience\nwas paired with a particular odor it\nwould be hard to do with visual cues and\nsleep or sound\num could one um attempt to introduce a\nsort of a competing sound you know set\nup a sort of a collision um uh stimulus\nso that in sleep the the dream would no\nlonger contain the the scary content or\nit would be less scary or is this\nexactly the wrong approach because if we\nbelieve that the nightmares are serving\nsome functional purpose allowing us to\nwork through what you really don't want\nto do right okay great then we answer\nthe question well no I I think it's I\nthink it's unclear right now but you're\non the right line because there is\nsomething that we have in in learning in\nmemory called fear\nExtinction and let's say that I were to\nsort of classic pavlovian learning\nPavlov's dogs let's say I show you a\nspecific image on the screen and then\nyou hear a specific tone and then you\nget an electric shock I show you the\nstimulus on the screen you hear the\nspecific tone and then you get an\nelectrical shock that I don't show you\nthe S stimulus on the screen but you do\nstill hear the tone and then what\nhappens is that you have a braced\nresponse to the electrical shock and\nthere's all sorts of combinations in\nbetween of that but essentially I\ncondition you to learn that these things\nseem to be associated with a negative\noutcome the inverse being the pavlovian\ndog which is that you ring a bell you\nshow the dog some food and it salivates\nyou ring the bell show the dog some food\nand it salivates and then you ring the\nbell you don't give it some food and it\nstill salivates because it knows that\nthe Bell precedes the the meat being\nshown and I actually mixed my um my\norder around there in my own experiment\nto begin with but then there's something\ndifferent that you can do you can start\nto perhaps change the sound or the\nbonded connection and then you don't\nstart getting the shock anymore so that\nsame ringing of the Bell now is no\nlonger consistently associated with the\nfood and gradually you decondition the\ndog such that after some time it learns\noh I started to learn that the Bell\npredicted food but now it no longer does\nand it takes some time to remove that\nand that's what we call Extinction\nyou've induced an association and then\nyou gradually extinguish it by way of\nthat alternate Training Method\nso the question then became could we use\nthat type of method but during sleep\ncould we train you up on a fear memory\nand then just begin the early signs of\nextinguishing of deconditioning you but\nthen we don't do that very much we wait\nuntil sleep and we continue the\ndeconditioning protocol and sure enough\nsleep seems to be as if not more\neffective at extinguishing those fear\nmemories than when you enact the\nprotocol during wakefulness so here is a\nvery good example of where you can use\nthis sleep dependent memory processing\ntapestry this opportunity to harness not\njust to strength them memories that you\nwish to keep but start to extinguish\nmemories you wish to remove and so I\nthink it's a very exciting it's right on\nthe cusp of what we're starting to do\nright now but I love it because I think\nsome people would like to experience\ncertain dreams and other people would\nlike to uh not experience certain\nnightmares which reminds me of a a tool\nthat Rick Rubin taught me um I don't\nknow of any experiments that uh support\nthis directly but I've tried this and\nand it certainly has worked first time\nand every time which is Rick said um if\nyou wake up from a dream and you want to\nremember your dream and you or and or\nyou found it Pleasant or interesting lay\nthere completely still with your eyes\nclosed and it will come to you um\nwhereas if you wake up from a nightmare\nwhich many people do and um in a state\nof anxiety and you have a hard time kind\nof shaking the the disturbing AFF effect\nassociated with that nightmare to move\nyour body get up and move your body and\nmaybe even flip some lights on something\nthat normally I don't suggest in the\nmiddle of the night but waking up from a\nnightmare can be quite quite um\ndisturbing and it can be um disturbing\nenough that it makes it difficult to\nfall back asleep um so and by the way\nhe's he's he's right I I don't know if\nhe's read the science or it's he's just\nit's knowing Rick he's probably just\nbecause he's so Yoda likee he's probably\nintuited Supernatural levels of insight\ntens of thousands of scientific articles\nbut he's absolutely right one of the\nways if you really wish to remember your\ndreams is not just jump up out of bed\nand start trying to write them down\ndon't lie in bed keep your eyes closed\nand gradually rehearse that dream over\nand over in your mind almost as though\nyou're scoring it into the etched\nsurface your memory Trace more and more\nand gradually when you've re sort of\ncapitulated and pieced back the jigsaw\npuzzle then gradually open your eyes\nstart to dictate start to write down but\ndon't do it immediately because as soon\nas you start doing it it begins to float\naway it begins to dissolve in a way\nthat's you you sort of you know you're\nrunning and you're trying to reach your\nhand out F exactly that's why I use the\nThe Voice Memos last night I woke up in\nthe middle of the night from a dream and\nI decided to turn on voice memos and I\nremember thinking I'll remember this in\nthe morning and I remember you never\nremember this in the\nmorning that is a perfect segue for\nlucid dreaming which is uh the awareness\nthat we are dreaming well in a dream uh\nis lucid dreaming real can we train\nourselves to lucid dream and what is the\nvalue of lucid dreaming is it just a fun\num game we can play is there any\nis there any reason we should attempt to\nlucid dream if we don't already or\nencourage more lucid dreaming or even\nany reason we shouldn't perhaps um lucid\ndreaming you beautifully gave the\ndefinition Loosely defined lucid\ndreaming is that you simply know that\nyou're dreaming whilst you are dreaming\nso in other words as the dream is\nunfolding you gain awareness of ah this\nis a dream but I'm still dreaming at\nthat moment by science definition you\nare in a state of Lucidity but most\npeople don't really mean that when they\nsay oh I'm a lucid dreamer they mean yes\nI'm I become aware that I'm Dreaming as\nI am dreaming and then I take over the\nReigns of control and then starting to\ndecide exactly what it is you dream and\nhow you dream so now I'm on the ground\nand I'm walking through a park and I\ndecide that I just want to take off and\nI want to fly over the river or I want\nto fly out over San Francisco Bay and\ntake a tour so I decide to start flying\nthat is what most people think of as\nlucid\ndreaming if you were to think about it\nthis thing called Dreaming as we've\ndescribed is utterly absurd as a state\nbased on its psychotic kind of Nature\nand characteristics to then start to say\nit's that idiotic and strange and\nbizarre but PS I can also take control\nof it and decide what I want to do with\nit injects a whole dose of disbelief\ninto a process that's already\nunbelievable by itself so science for a\nwhile just thought this is charlatan\ntype stuff that these people claim that\nthey can control their dreams how can\nyou ever prove that because don't forget\nwhen you go into rem's sleep and you\ndream you are paralyzed so I can't just\nwake up and say I was lucid dreaming\nthat's not proof I have to in some ways\nbe able to demonstrate that I'm lucid\ndreaming as I begin to become Lucid but\nI can't because I can't communicate with\nyou as the\nscientist well it turns out that you can\none of the things we spoke about in the\nfirst episode is that yes you get these\nrapid eye movements but think about what\nthat means I told you that when you\ndream your brain paralyzes all of your\nvoluntary muscles so that you can dream\nand dream safely and you don't act out\nyour dreams with the exception that at\nleast two muscle groups your extraocular\nmuscles that move your eyes and your\ninner ear muscles for some reason they\nare spurred from the paralysis so you\ncan still move otherwise you could never\nhave rapid eye\nmovements so the eyes all of a sudden\nbecause we have electrodes up top and\nbelow and left and right sides we can\nmeasure what you're doing with your eyes\nduring sleep in fact we have to do this\nto determine are you awake or are you in\nREM sleep the brain activity by itself\ndoesn't tell us that we measure your\nmuscle activity and if you lose muscle\nactivity and your brain is very active\nand the eye channels that we're\nrecording start to show these darting\nback and forth signals we know you're in\nRam sleep that's how we Define it so\nthat then suggested to us we can use the\neye movements to create a form of Morse\ncode signaling from the participant to\nthe\nexperiment and so let's say that with\nthis claimed Lucid dreamer who comes to\nmy sleep center we'll create a very\nspecific greed upon code which is that\nas you start dreaming I can see that and\nwhen you become Lucid in that dream\nfirstly give me three leftward flicks of\nyour eyes we never see that in dreaming\nit's a very deliberative act and then\nwhen you say okay I'm I've started the\nlucid dreaming and you've agreed with\nthe experiment that you're then going to\nstart um moving your hands you're going\nto start to move your right hand well\nwhen you start to move your right hand\ngive me four flicks to the right and\nwhen you're moving your left hand in the\ndream give me four flicks to the left\nand so there we create this very\nspecific instigation\ncode but then how does that help help us\nwell we can have you sleeping in a brain\nscanner and before the brain scanning\nsession when you sleep I have you just\ngo into the brain scanner awake and I\nsay move your left hand and your right\nmotor cortex is going to be lighting up\nand then I'm going to say move your\nright hand and your left motor cortex is\ngoing to be lighting up and for you and\nme I build up a very unique map of your\nleft hand motor memory representation\nand your right hand motor memory\nrepresentation and if it's the left hand\nas I said it's the right side of the\nbrain if it's the right hand it's the\nleft side of the brain so now I've got\nground truth as to where your hand\nrepresentation is on your motor cortex\nin my brain scanner and then I'm going\nto put you back in the brain scanner let\nyou go into sleep let you start dreaming\nthen you give me three left flicks good\nthis person has now become lucid and now\nhe's doing four rightward flicks which\nwhich means he's clasping his right hand\nover and over again and then he gives me\nfour leftwood flicks which means he\nswitched over he's now using his left\nhand in his dream by the way I'm looking\nat the participant inside of the brain\nscanner through the glass and of course\nthey're not moving their hand why\nbecause they're paralyzed but in the\ndream they are claiming based on their\neye movements that they are moving their\nhands we bring them back out of the\nbrain scanner and we analyze their brain\nscans during the period when they said\nI'm moving my right hand I'm moving my\nleft hand what did we see sure enough we\nsaw the same and we being the Royal wi\nit's a great study by a German group\nsure enough you see exactly the same\npattern it was scientific groundtruth\nevidence that when a lucid dreamer\nclaims they are doing something in the\ndream the brain scans that we received\nconfirmed that indeed that's exactly\nwhat was happening it's just that none\nof the signal is being sent out to the\nperiphery to the limbs because there's\nthat that um cut off at the spinal cord\ndescending inhibition yeah at the level\nof the alphao neurons if your spinal\ncord incredible so here we are talking\nabout lucid dreaming which is a kind of\nmixed level of Consciousness dreaming of\ncourse but also Lucidity that is an\nawareness that one is dreaming now in\njust about every one of the five\nepisodes leading up to this sixth\nepisode in this series you emphasize the\nkey importance of deep sleep and rapid\neye movement sleep and in many ways some\nof the problems that arise from waking\nup in the middle of the night too many\ntimes or being in Shallow sleep as\nopposed to Deep Sleep lucid dreaming it\nseems is a kind of a case of light sleep\nbecause of one's awareness or is it so\nthat's one the first question and then\njust very quickly an anecdote when I was\na kid I used to read these like boy life\nmagazines and those kind of things I for\nwhat they called but in the back they\nwould have these um these ads for for\nproducts like x-ray glasses or you know\nor um or sea monkeys which turned out to\nbe Brian shrimp what a disappointment\nthat was um and um I thought they were\nmonkeys on the on the package they were\nlittle monkeys but they were Brian\nshrimp\num there was a product advertised that I\nin fact purchased which was an ey mask\nthat had a little blinking red light in\none corner and it said learn to lucid\ndream and the idea was that you would\nput this thing on and look at the red\nlight just prior to going to sleep and\nthen you go to sleep with this thing on\nand then at some point in your sleep you\nwould see or think that you saw the red\nlight flashing and the idea was that\nbecause you were in the ey mask you're\nin enough of a dream that you would be\nable to link the waking State\nrecognition of the light Etc okay people\nget\nit I purchased that product I used it I\nthought perhaps there was an effect\nquote unquote where I could lucid dream\nbut I wouldn't consider myself an avid\nLucid dreamer although sometimes I am\naware that I'm dreaming and usually it's\nin um pleasant dreams in which case I'm\nusually like yeah let's keep this going\nthings like flying and and being you\nknow particularly talented in a sport\nthat in my Waking Life I had minimal\nTalent things like that okay so is lucid\ndreaming a case of shallow sleep and\ntherefore something to\navoid or is lucid dreaming something\nquite different and is there any\nadvantage to learning to lucid dream or\nenhancing one's amount of lucid dreaming\nand if so how should one go about that\nso I'll take the question should you be\nlucid dreaming and I think I can argue\nit both sides right now and we don't\nhave a very clear answer yet the first\nside is if you take a step back and ask\nfrom an evolutionary perspective let's\nassume for for want of a better worth\nthat lucid streaming is helpful it's\nmeaningful and that we should engage in\nit if that's the case that it confers\nsome type of evolutionary benefit then\nyou would expect that a lot of people\nwould be doing it but if you look at the\nstatistics somewhere between maybe just\n10 to 20% of the population are natural\nlucid dreamers and so from an\nevolutionary perspective I could say\nwell if it was so powerful it was so\nmeaningful because we know everyone\nsleeps and for the most part we can say\nthat almost everyone dreams if that's\nthe case then those must clearly serve a\npurpose but the fact that very few\npeople are lucid dreamers doesn't that\ntell us that it isn't necessarily\nbeneficial so from that perspective I\ncan play those numbers there is an\ninherent flaw in my argument there\nhowever because that assumes based on\nthe argument I've just given you that we\nhave stopped evolving and of course we\nhave not and so perhaps that 10 to 10 to\n20% of the population who are natural\nlucid dreamers are at the Forefront of\nhomonid\nevolution and they're the next Super\nrate we shouldn't be worried about AI we\nshould be worried about the lucid dreams\nbecause they're going to come and take\nover the world so I can argue it from\nthat perspective which is just a\nphilosophical argument it doesn't have\nweighted data to it but there is some\ndata some individuals have asked the\nquestion is there any changes to your\nsleep or even the benefits of sleep when\nyou are a lucid dreamer versus not and\nwhat's interesting is that for some\npapers that have been published after\nnights when people report lucid dreaming\nthey wake up and they don't feel as\nrestored they don't feel as refreshed by\ntheir sleep in the morning suggest just\nas you sort of hinted at the that the\nlucid dreaming state is associated with\nperhaps a less deep or more shallow form\nof REM sleep or a more active state of\nREM sleep perhaps too active so that\nit's fatiguing and depleting and upon\nAwakening you don't get that memory and\nthat body that brain and body\nreset there are however a few papers\nthat have not found\nthat result so I think right now we\ndon't truly know if the Lucid state is\nassociated with unrefreshing sleep and\nunrest of sleep but if that proves true\nthen I think that that's one argument\nthe other argument I would put forward\nagainst it from that perspective would\nbe think about what we've said regarding\nthe functions of dreaming memory\nprocessing but particularly emotional\ntherapy to gift us mental\nhealth if we then come along and say\npresumably you know nature through\nmillions of years of evolution has come\nup with this this blueprint Manifesto of\nexactly what should be served up on the\ndream menu this\nevening that's there's a reason for that\nand that reason has been sculpted over\nmillions of years to become wonderfully\noptimal for us and our emotional mental\nhealth and then we come along in the\nspace of a lifetime and perhaps you\ncould argue a little bit humoristic we\nthink h i perhaps know a little bit\nbetter than a couple of million years of\nevolution I'm going to push those things\noff the rank ordering chart of what gets\nserved up into my dreams and I'm going\nto supersede that and decide what I\nwould prefer to be dreaming about and\nagain I think that there's no good\nevidence that you could argue that that\nisn't true but equally that it is true\nwe just don't know yet it if that is the\ncase that lucid dreaming does produce\nunrest of sleep in some ways it also\nbegs the question well what is happening\nin your brain during lucid dreaming is\nthere anything in your brain that would\nexplain why you don't feel\nrefreshed and early studies looking at\nlucid dreamers when we put them inside\nof a brain scanner I told you at the\nstart of this episode dream sleep has a\nunique brain signature memory regions\nemotion regions motor regions and visual\nRegions they're all lighting up but then\nthere's this one part of your brain that\ndoes the opposite which is the lateral\nuh left and right sides of your\nprefrontal cortex The Logical rational\nthinking controlling regions of your\nbrain those go\noffline but early studies demonstrated\nthat the activity including the\nelectrical activity over those frontal\nregions\nwould be down as you were in non lucid\ndreaming but then when people rise back\nup and said now I'm lucid dreaming with\nthose leftward flicks that activity was\nbrought back\nonline which makes a lot of mechanistic\nsense which is all of a sudden the part\nof your brain that prevented you from\nhaving rational logical control has been\nre-engaged and as a consequence you\nyourself can re-engage in volitional\ndictation of the outcome of what you're\ndreaming some studies however have not\nreplicated that finding because when\nthey looked at it and they took out some\nuh sort of what we call these um\ncovariates or these confounding factors\nand I can bore you with what that\nprinciple is it removed that result and\nall of a sudden the prefrontal cortex\nwent back to seemingly being nonactive\nthey did find an alternate result what\nthey found is that the electrical\nactivity of the brain when you go into a\nlucid dreaming State seems to be a bit\nmore frenetic a bit more active versus\nnon-lucid dreaming states of electrical\nbrain activity and if that's the case if\nthe cortex which is already active is\nforced to become even more frenetically\nactive when you are in this lucid dream\nstate is that part of the reason that\nwhen you wake up from the lucid dreaming\nand you go about your day your brain\njust doesn't seem to be at the same\noperating ability because it's being\nfatigued above and beyond it's like\nsaying I do a standard workout and I\nalways go to you know one or two reps\nbefore failure but now as I'm lucid\ndreaming I am constantly going to\ncomplete muscle failure and then the\nnext few days if you go and do a workout\nand I've been listening you and I have\nbeen trading workouts I don't want to do\nan Andrew hubman workout trust me you\nare this man is mine are short short and\nsweet this I I'm well let we'll work out\nat some point together but it's it's\nalmost as though then no big surprise\nthat after you do a legs day if I were\nto wake you up the next day and say\nyou're back doing legs she said I can't\ndo that I'm toast I'm host my legs are\ndone and that's what we think could\nperhaps explain why you get that fatigue\ndoes that make some sense makes very\ngood sense and you know in the absence\nof of better language to put to it I've\nlong thought that one of the best things\nabout sleep is that we are not engaging\nour frontal cortex that much in sleep um\nand as we talked about in an earlier\nepisode The frontal cortex during waking\nis responsible for things such as the\nsuppression of reflexes I mean it has to\ndo that according to context of a\nsituation it's a lot of work um and the\nfrontal cortex does a great number of\nother things as well but\nI think one of the most wonderful things\nabout sleep is that we get re release\nand um a break from all of that analysis\nof duration path and outcome you know\nwhat's how long is something going to\ntake what path is it do I need to take\nin order together what's the outcome\ngoing to be all that analysis of things\npast present and future it's work it's\nit's mental it's mental work and I think\nthat if if you tell me and I think you\njust did that lucid dreaming involves\nany kind of um encroachment of\nduration path outcome type of analysis\ninto my sleep my personal preference is\ngoing to be to not lucid dream I'd\nrather just have very robust perhap you\nknow dreams of different kinds and try\nto make sense of them once I wake up but\nit's so tempting though isn't it because\nlike you I've had those experience I\nremember an amazing dream where I was\nsnowboarding and I'm I am a below\naverage\nsnowboarder and all of a sudden I was\njust taking jump and I was doing all\nsorts of X game you're sha white I was\nit was unbelievable and I felt so and I\nwas so happy in the moment and I\nremember waking up and just thinking\nfirstly I'm sad I'm waking up right and\nsecond that was\nSublime and all I want to do tomorrow\nnight is go back and now I'm going to\nswitch my snowboard out for a dirt bike\nand I'm going to do the dirt bike X\nGames version of it and going to be\ndoing all sorts of Superman can't get\ngreedy with Mother Nature know know she\nbody slams you I get it I know if people\nout there are are you know enjoying it\nor wanting to do that um and by the way\nI didn't answer I'm so sorry your um red\nlight question which is if you wanted to\ndo it how can you do it if you're not\ndoing it already there are in fact two\nscientific methods that have been\ndeveloped one of them actually has a\nvague whiff of relationship ship to the\nlight device although that's one of\nthose things where if you know if a\nfriend sent it to me or a random person\nsaid oh Dr I've seen this in the back of\na magazine do you think it works I would\njust say please go and spend your $199\non something that is going to I think I\nwas about 11 or 12 years old I think it\ncost something like I $10.99 or\nsomething which at the time for me was a\nlot of money but I had a paper rout I\nhad a paper route back then and I had a\nlittle little bit of of a a disp I\nincome but um it was cool cuz it was it\nwas probably one of my first experiments\nI've been running experiments since I\nwas a kid but but I I think self\nexperimentation can be fun provided you\ncan see that but sorry coming back to\nyour red light the two methods one of\nthem is something called the mild\ntechnique which stands for the pneumonic\ninduction of lucid dreaming m i l d\npneumonic just meaning a memory based\ntechnique induction obviously what we're\ntrying to induce something and what is\nit we're trying to induce lucid dreaming\nand it's a very simple technique which\nis that you consistently rehearse before\nbed this notion that I will remember my\ndreams and I will instigate control in\nmy dreams and you do this and it sounds\njust so hokey and non-scientific sure\nenough you do this over and over again\nthe probability that you will loci a\ndream increases I think the better one\nmaybe the more effective one is called\nthe reality testing method and it was\nprobably made famous in a brilliant\nmovie if you haven't seen it everyone\nshould watch it it's called Waking Life\nand it is an amazing Richard linklater\nuh the director it just for the\nphilosophy alone in it it will blow your\nmind it's exceptional but it's a\nbeautiful tretis on dreaming and lucid\ndreaming\nand in that they describe a method where\nduring the waking day you are constantly\nperhaps you can set an alarm and you're\nconstantly reminded to go over to let's\nsay the wall and flip the light switch\non and off on and off on and off and\nsure enough what happens the lights go\non and off why because it's the real\nworld and it complies and it's complicit\nwith the laws of\nphysics so you do this time and time\nagain and you start to train yourself\nthat at unique moments throughout your\nwaking experience you always go over and\nyou test some version of reality and it\nor it could just be I'm going to press\nmy hand into something solid and this\ntable is resisting my hand right now as\nI'm pressing and I just keep doing that\nand then at some point it becomes\nroutine enough that you start to do that\nsame thing when you are dreaming but now\nwhen I press my hand against the table\nor press my hand against the wall my\nhand goes straight through the wall or I\nflip the light switch on and off and the\nlights do nothing and all of a sudden\nthat's my cue to\nsay I'm not awake am I I'm I'm dreaming\nand therefore at that point I gain\nLucidity and it increases the\nprobability so those are the two methods\nthat people have used and statistically\nscientifically they do seem to have some\ndegree of success I love it I love it I\npersonally I'm going to opt to not\nencourage lucid dreaming because I'm and\nmyself because I'm I'm working on\ngetting my sleep deeper and longer uh\nthrough the night with uh fewer waking\nepisodes we will get that we will get\nthere using the tools described in the\nprevious and this episode of the uh of\nthe series that we're doing here my\nsleep's been excellent at times pretty\ngood at other times and and lousy at\nothers which I think makes me well\nqualified um to talk about tools for\nsleep because I feel like I've come at\nit from every level of of performance\nvery much and by the way um Shield swort\nin hand I'm right there by your side\nwe'll we'll make it happen don't worry\nwell thank you uh\ntruly okay so\nsadly we are nearing the end of this six\nepisode series and here we are in the\nsixth\nepisode however last night before\nleaving the studio I decided to put out\na word on social media on X AKA Twitter\nand on\nInstagram asking people what questions\nthey have about sleep and I made it very\nBroadband you know I said ask anything\nyou want about sleep Matt Walker will\nwill do his best to answer and of course\nwe had thousands and thousands and\nthousands of questions um and we're\ngrateful let's push on through till dawn\nwhich completely violates every one of\nthe six EP I'm they'll benefit we'll\nwe'll struggle however we were able to\num bin those responses into most\nfrequently Asked uh most frequently\nliked Etc and so while we can't ask\nevery question of you uh what I thought\nwould be fun and very informative uh for\nthe listeners is to ask 10 of the most\npopular questions um and fingers on\nbuzzers no confering here we go and\nthese are questions for which I I think\nthere are practical answers um and so\nwe'll do this not in Rapidfire Q&A but\nin uh let's just say a bridged format\nand then um perhaps we have you back\nanother time um to uh answer more of the\nthe questions before we get into these\nquestions I will say that many of the\nquestions that were asked uh of the uh\nby the audience in those comments um\nwere in fact answered in the earlier\nfive episodes of this podcast series\nwith Matt Walker as well as the one that\nthat we held today on on dreams and\nlucid dreaming so if you don't hear the\nanswer to these uh to your question here\nand you have a burning question chances\nare your question was answered in a\nprevious episode and all of those\nepisodes are um time stamped in a lot of\ndetail so people can navigate quickly to\nthe topics most of interest to them so\nwithout further Ado questions from the\naudience first question is about best\npractices for managing rumination and\nnegative thoughts when trying to fall\nasleep meaning if somebody is ruminating\nand they're having negative thoughts\nwhen they're trying to fall asleep what\nshould they do in order to get past that\nand fall asleep short circuit you need\nto Short Circuit that situation and the\nway that you can do that is through a\nvariety of methods there are multiple\nmethods for short circuiting rumination\nthe first I would recommend and it's\nsomething I practice meditation but\nreally all of these that I'll describe\nare about getting your mind off itself\nthat's the biggest problem regarding\nanxiety and sleep onset insomnia which\nis what I think this person is\ndescribing so meditation allows you it's\neither guide Ed and you're speaking\nabout what you should be doing with your\nbreathing or relaxation uh guided\nmeditations all of those stop your mind\nfrom being able to play on itself and go\nthrough that Rolodex of anxiety you can\ndo breathing techniques you can listen\nto sleep stories you can do your own\ntype of body scan anything that you can\nyou can do and something we described\nwhich is seems to be a quite effective\nmethod is taking yourself on a mental\nwalk\nclose your eyes and a walk that you know\nintensely well with Vivid 4K detail\nreplicate that to the L I left foot on\nthe first step down the steps take a\nright out the driveway up I go walk up\nthe hill look to the left the bay is out\nthere it's 5:00 p.m. the sun is starting\nto set that level of detail and usually\nwhen you do any one of these things the\nnext thing that you remember is that\nyou're waking up in the morning because\nyou are able to Short Circuit that would\nbe the best advice terrific and I must\nsay the other night I woke up in the\nmiddle of the night and was having a\nlittle bit of trouble falling back\nasleep and I used this mental walk\napproach and it and it worked um oh very\nvery well so thank you I um the next\nquestion is what is the best position to\nsleep in best body\nposition best body position is probably\nthe absence of the worst that would be\nyour back and it's ill advised mostly\nfor people who snore when you are on\nyour back the likelihood of you you\nsnoring and that Airway collapsing\nentirely and you having what's called a\nhypoxic event where you stop breathing\nentirely is significantly higher than if\nyou sleep on your side or on your front\nso I would say that for most people if\nyou know that you don't snore if your\npartner says I don't hear you snoring\nthat's partial confirmation that you do\nnot snore if you are curious and\neveryone should be everyone should be\ncurious as to whether they snore I would\nsay download an app and we can link to\nit I have no affiliation with whatsoever\nI pay my money I think it's like Pennies\non the dollar it's like $2 a month or\nsomething and it is called snore lab so\nthe word snore and then\nlab and you download it and it's an app\nand it is uh something that you install\non your phone and then you say start\nrecording and you place your phone face\ndown and it listens to you all night and\nit records your breathing nothing more\ncan't know what you're doing or saying\ndon't worry there's privacy but it\nassesses your breathing and then it will\nshow you a distribution of your snoring\nthroughout the night and it categorizes\nthat snoring from quiet no snoring to\nmild snoring to moderate to Epic\nand it literally is like a RTO shock and\nyou will see very clearly if you are\nsnoring or not wor still and impactful\nmost is that you can go to those spikes\nwhen you are snoring and you can replay\nit and it is quite frightening to hear\nyourself struggling for breath if you\nsee a confirmation of snoring by way of\nthat snor La go and see your doctor that\nis the best advice 80% of people who\nhave sleep apnea or snoring or in\nsensation of breathing are undiagnosed\nright now and it will take years off\nyour life and when you get treated it is\ntransformational patient once told me\nwhen I got treated with with my sleep\napp device I felt like I was 10 years\nyounger it was almost as though and I'll\nremember it to the day I die it was\nalmost as though someone came along and\nwiped a fogged glass clear and I could\nfinally see that was the trans\nso my advice is if you think you are\nsnoring stay away from back sleeping\nfrom sleeping on your back from sleeping\non your back and even if you don't\nsuspect you are a snorer just download\nthis app you get a couple of nights for\nfree just do it for a couple of nights\nconsistently and then ask also by the\nway if you take on board alcohol and you\nhave mild snoring it is very clear I\nwould be highly surprised if on the\nnights that you drink you don't get a\nsignificant increase in your score of\nsnoring terrific\nthe next question is why does my body\nwake up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm presuming\ntheir mind as well no matter what time I\ngo to sleep so to that question and we\nwill have spoken about this before my\nfirst response is how do you know it's\n3:30 and their response is because I\nlook at the clock that's the first\nproblem take all clock faces away from\nyour sight when you are sleeping it is\nonly going to reinforce it the second is\nthat 3:30 can sometimes or if it's a\nconsistent time it's not there's no sort\nof special thing about 3:30 it's just\nfor this person people wake up at very\nspecific times quite reliably so part of\nthat is because they're going through\nvery reliably timed sleep cycles and\nevery time we finish a REM sleep period\nwe wake up but it's normally very brief\nand the reason is because we've been in\nparalysis and the body needs to move so\nwe wake up we make a postural shift we\nmove in our bed just slightly and then\nwe go back to sleep it happens to us all\nfor some of us we will wake up and then\nwe will stay awake and that's why it\nseems to be so religiously timed to\ncertain specific moments in our night\nbut this other sort of individual\nmention no matter what time I go to bed\nI seem to always wake up there that to\nme smells of a suggestion of reinforced\nlearning that you've woken up a couple\nof times you've checked the clock and\nnow you have taught your brain very very\nquickly that I always wake up at 3:30 in\nthe morning and lo and behold what\nhappens is that you start to do that\nmore frequently the more frequently it\nhappens the more times that you check\nthe stronger that memory Association\nbecomes the more likely it is to happen\nremove the clock face from the bed\nroom terrific uh can we Bank sleep or\ncatch up on Lost\nsleep it's a great question you you can\nand you cannot Bank sleep and it is\ndirectional so what we found is that for\ncertain things such as let's say um an\nimmune um vaccination or learning in\nmemory if you are sleep deprived let's\nsay the night after learning a specific\ntask and lots of people have done this\nso you are deprived the first night\nafter learning and that first night we\nknow is critical for consolidating\nsaving those memories but then the next\nday I don't test you in the way I would\nnormally do instead I give you a full\nrecovery night of sleep or maybe I give\nyou two full recovery nights of sleep\nand then I test you do you show any\nevidence of a memory consolid\nconsolidation benefit and the answer is\nno you don't in other words if you don't\nsleep the first night after learning you\nlose the chance to consolidate those\nmemories so there sleep in that sense is\nan all in nothing think phenomenon if\nyou don't snooze you lose in that regard\nand there are other examples of that\ndownstairs in the\nbody that is what happens when you go\ninto a debt and then you try to pay it\nback with later credit and it fails you\ncan't seem to do that with sleep so in\nthat sense sleep is not like the bank in\nthat direction you can't accumulate a\ndebt and then let's say at the weekend\nafter short sleeping during the week see\nif you can pay off that debt at some lat\npointed time it doesn't work like that\nso for example if I deprive you Andrew\nhubman of sleep tonight let's say it's\nan 8 Hour opportunity and then tomorrow\nI give you all of the recovery sleep\nthat you want and then on a second night\nthird night fourth night do you sleep\nlonger those subsequent nights yes you\ndo but you only sleep back about 50%\nabout four extra hours in fact if you\nlook at the data it's usually less it's\nusually around two so only about 25% of\nthe eight hours that you lost so you are\nall always running a debt and if that's\nthe case if you can't truly pay back\nyour sleep debt and you're constantly\nrunning that short sleep cycle you are\nit's like compounding interest on the\nloan it just escalates dramatically and\nthat's why I think we see that short\nsleep really does predict ill health\noutcomes and more an early mortality the\nlater and later in life that you go\nhowever there is a different form of\nsleep banking I told you that here\nyou're going into a debt and you're\ntrying to pay it off with credit later\nwhat if you had the inverse let's say\nthat you are a a doctor or a nurse or um\nyou are working in the emergency\nservices and you know that you have two\nnights where you're on nights and it\nyou're going to be probably very busy\nand you're not going to be sleeping well\nfor the next two nights and that's going\nto be next Monday and Tuesday and I'm\nCurr L on Wednesday in the week prior\nthere is something that has been\ndemonstrated called Sleep banking which\nis where I know I'm going to go into\ndebt so I sleep longer and I create\ncredit to begin with and then I spend\nthat credit as I go into debt and it\nseems to lessen the impact of that debt\nit doesn't remove the impact entirely\nbut it does lessen it so here it's the\ninverse I'm not going into debt and then\ntrying to pay it off later I build up\ncredit and then I can spend that credit\nwith debt so there is a form of sleep\nbanking that seems to be present but\nit's not the Sleep banking that most\npeople think about does that make I know\nit's very confusing but I tried to be\nclear about made it very clear that you\ncan um buffer some of the Sleep loss\nthat you\nanticipate um but there's no there's no\nretroactive saving of of what you lost\nthat's right um what are some of the\nbest practices is for getting back to\nsleep after waking up in the middle of\nthe\nnight there I would say there are\nseveral things first don't try too hard\nbecause trying to get back to sleep and\nbecome frustrated is very much like\ntrying to remember someone's name sleep\nis just like this that the harder you\ntry the further you push it away and as\nsoon as you stop up all of a sudden that\nname just pops back into your head and\nit's the same way with sleep now\npreviously I've said you don't want to\nspend a lot of time awake in bed because\nyou learn the association that your bed\nis the place of wakefulness and every\ntime you come in at night you're always\nwide awake and you don't know why\ndespite having fallen asleep watching\ntelevision just 20 minutes\nearlier the other suggestion however is\nmost people don't want to get out of bed\nit's dark it's cold I get it I\nunderstand it the other thing to do in\nthis situation is enjoy the concept of\nrest so wouldn't it be wonderful if in\nthe middle of your working day someone\nsaid look just come away from your desk\nnow and here is a beautiful calm bedroom\nit smells very nice nice dim light I\nwould like you to lie down no need to\nfall asleep don't fall asleep just lie\ndown on the bed or on the couch and just\nrest for the next 30 or 40 minutes just\nhave a wonderful good old rest that\nsounds\nlovely and if you are struggling to fall\nback asleep and you've listened to me\nand the idiocy of what I've been\ndescribing over the past six episodes\nyou you could start to get very stressed\nand say gosh well sleep is doing this\nand this and this and and I'm now and\nit's been 20 minutes and I can't fall\nback you just get more and more stressed\ninstead take a different approach at\nthat point instead of if you all the\ntechniques that we've spoken about\ngetting your mind off itself and we list\nthem just now and we've listed them in a\nprevious episode if none of those are\nworking and you just can't catch it\ndon't worry just say to yourself you\nknow what tonight is not my night and he\ntold me it's okay and it really is it's\nit's fine tomorrow night is going to be\na better night tonight instead rather\nthan trying to force myself to sleep I'm\njust going to lie here maybe with my\neyes open I'm just going to rest I'm\njust going to enjoy and not stress I'm\njust going to enjoy a good old rest in\nmy bed and once again the next thing\nthat happens is that the sun has emerged\nit's bright in your room despite the\nblackout curtains and your alarm is\ngoing off because as soon as you relaxed\nout of the state of\ntrying sleep came back in a resplendant\ndidn't way\nterrific someone asks quote I used to be\na great sleeper but as I've gotten older\nand then they mention that they're 65\ncurrently I find that I wake up much\nearlier than I did previously and it's\ndifficult for me to get more than six\nhours of sleep what do you think is\ngoing on and what are some\nremedies the first question I would want\nto ask is how do you feel on 6 hours of\nsleep and we can go from there if you\nare imper and you're struggling during\nthe day and this person sounds as though\nthey are unhappy with that 6 hours then\nwe can start to have a conversation what\nwould that conversation sound like I\nwant to understand perhaps the reason\nthat you can't get back asleep and we'll\nbegin these techniques that we've spoken\nabout for trying to get back to sleep\nlet's say that you've gone to bed at\n10:00 and you normally would like to\nwake up at 6:00 but you're always waking\nup at 4:00 and there's just nothing you\ncan do at that stage you just don't feel\nthe sleepiness over you weighing you\ndown and there's no amount of these\nmethods are going to help you you just\nhave to get up we see this a lot in\nolder adults sleep late in the night is\nvery fragile much greater probability of\nthem waking up in the second half of the\nnight and the last\nquarter it's also miserable because most\nolder adults the Cadian Rhythm shifts\nearlier I told you that as we go through\nour teen years our Cadian Rhythm shifts\nit gets sort of pushed into the the\nfuture and we like to go to bed much\nlater and wake up much later and then\ninto older adult sort of into well\nadulthood it drags back a little bit and\nwe find our sweet spot but then as we\nget older it starts to regress back to\nwhat happened when we were children we\nwant to stay up late but we can't we go\nto bed so early and we wake up early\nsome regression happens as we get older\nby the way it's the reason that there is\nthe quote unquote early bird special in\nFlorida where a lot of people retire\nit's the early bird special because most\npeople are to bed by you know 9:00 p.m.\nand they want to be eating starting to\neat at 4 p.m. so how do you deal with\nthat one way is you can use one of the\nfour methods the four sort of macros of\ngood sleep that we spoke about Q qrt\nquantity quality regularity timing here\nI would say see if you can delay your\nbedtime as best you can if your bedtime\nis 10: and you would like and you're\nnormally waking up at 6:00 but you're\nconsistently waking up at 4:00 start\ntrying to go to bed at 11 p.m. push push\npush as hard as you can until you are so\nsleepy you sleep and then you will it\nwill take a couple of days to build up\nthat sort of remembering of from your\nbrain and the de that to begin with\nyou'll go to bed now at 11: and you'll\nwake up at 4: again and things are even\nworse but after a while you're building\nup this pressure to sleep and all of a\nsudden you're going to bed again at 11:\nbut your brain thinks I have had four\nnights of now just 5 hours of\nsleep this I'm not doing this anymore\nI'm going to sleep through until 5: and\nyou can keep moving your schedule later\nbecause when older adults are waking up\nat 4: and they can't get back it's also\nmiserable because the rest of the world\nis asleep and the people they want to\nengage with have a social life you know\ncall the kids uh speak with their\ngrandkids they can't do any of that so\nit's a very difficult situation if those\nthings don't work you can also speak to\na board-certified sleep medicine\nclinician cbti cognitive behavioral\ntherapy for insomnia which you we've\nspoken about in this episode is also\neffective for older adults to help them\nstay asleep if that doesn't work and you\ndon't like to think about a\npsychological treatment there are some\nmedications people think I'm probably a\nbit anti-m medication because I've been\nvery vocal about classic sleeping pills\nbut there are some sleeping medications\nthat I think do show promise I'm not\nanti- pharmacology by any means one of\nthem that's been shown to be effective\nfor older adults is something called\ndopin and and trazadone 2 although there\nis some sort of push back a little bit\nby the community against trazadone and\nthere's a new class of drugs that we've\nspoken about in a previous episode\ncalled the Doras the jeel orexin\nreceptor antagonists d r a small s so\nI've spoken about three there trazadone\ndopin the Doras by the way I'm a\nscientist not a medical doctor this is\nscientifically descriptive not medically\nprescriptive tesone has perhaps been\nused more so if anything to help people\nwho strug to fall asleep doyin if you\nlook at the data is a medication that's\nmuch more helpful for keeping people\nasleep and including in a especially it\nseems for older adults and there it's\nlower dose doxin I think if you look at\nthe data 3 milligrams and 6 milligram\ndoses have been effective you can get it\nin pill form although usually not in\nthose Doses and you have to end up\ncutting pills in half because it comes\nin 12 milligram there is a liquid\nsolution that is provided and there I\nthink the standard dose starts at around\nhalf a milliliter so you get a little\nsyringe and it's a 1 mm syringe and you\nsuck up that um half a milliliter and\nthen you just put it in a drink in the\nlast half an hour before bed it's\ntasteless and it helps you stay asleep\nso there are a variety of different\nthings you can do just go try for rest\nand just give yourself the chance push\nyour bed to a later time point you can\nalso try cognitive behavioral therapy\nfor insomnia and you can speak with your\nphysician about some sleep medications\nterrific there were a good number of\npeople that asked about sleep and\nmenopause um one question was quote\nsince entering menopause I have not\ngotten a good night's sleep in years um\nI think this question dovetails with the\nprevious question I mean it could be age\nrelated right could be directly related\nto menopause um so are you aware of any\nspecific treatments that you haven't\ncovered in the course of this uh Q&A\nthat are unique to menopause I think the\nanswer you just gave um to whom ever\nasked uh the question about you know how\nto get more sleep or better sleep as one\nhas gotten older should probably handle\nthe answer to this question but what of\nthe um men anda's specific requirements\nfor getting um better sleep it is a huge\nproblem in um premenopausal and\nperimenopausal uh women and of course\nwomen going through uh menopause it's\nprincipally because of what we call the\nvasom motor symptoms of of menopause\nwhich is to say these hot flashes where\nyou just get EX sort of really for the\nbody at Le quite extreme increases in\ntemperature you get so hot and don't\nforget in our um episode two we spoke\nabout how you need to regulate\ntemperature and there's a very beautiful\nand complex relationship between\ntemperature and sleep and we said you\nneed to stay cool to stay as sleep but\nhere is a situation where when you're\nasleep you're not staying cool you're\ndoing the opposite you're getting warm\nand that is the adversarial thermal\nsituation for staying asleep and so\nindividuals wake up and then they\nstruggle to get back to\nsleep I would say and we know the\nreasons why too some of the other issues\nwith sleep are problematic it has to do\nwith some of the sex hormone changes and\nuh I think I've myself have released a a\npodcast on this um specific issue and I\nwon't go into the mechanisms as to why\nI'll speak about the treatments one\ntreatment which is non-medication based\nis trying to make your bedroom cool but\nalso using these smart mattresses now\nI've spoken to Mato the CEO of eight\nsleep another fantastic product and he\nhas had a huge amount of feedback from\nmenopausal women saying that that\ncooling mattress has been very helpful\nfor their vasom motor symptoms so that's\none method you can go down the the other\nis a medication method and here I need\nto be very careful I'm going to speak\nabout bioidentical hormone replacement\ntherapy for menopause now there is a lot\nof controversy again I don't have a\nhorse in the race I would simply say if\nyou want to think about this you have\ndone a fantastic podcast on female\nhealth and female reproductive health I\nknow our friend Petra Tia has got a very\nclear stance on female hormone\nreplacement therapy and the absence of\nfear one has to have around the risk of\nbreast cancer and if you listen to him\nhe will excise or at least he has\ndisabused I think many people of the\nbelief that that is a concern but it's a\nvery personal choice it's a woman's\nchoice no one but a woman can decide but\nI would say that when women have gone\ninto bio bioidentical hormone\nreplacement therapy one of the things\nthat benefits is also sleep because it\nbrings back under control some of the\nthese symptoms it reinstates some of the\nuh renormalization of aspects of um\nreproductive hormones and those are\nthings that can promote sleep which when\nthey become absent through menopause are\ncausing sleep disruption great someone\nasks what does it mean if I can remember\nmy dreams conversely what does it mean\nif I cannot remember my dreams does this\nhave any reflection on my Sleep Quality\nwell some of this was addressed during\ntoday's episode but maybe um just to\ngive a a short recap um response uh how\nwould you respond to this so I would say\nthat just because you remember your\ndreams or you don't remember your let's\nsay you don't remember your dreams many\npeople will ask me then does that mean\nthat I don't get REM sleep or I don't\nget enough REM sleep no absolutely it\ndoesn't there seems to be no correlation\nbetween how much REM sleep that you're\ngetting and whether or not you remember\nyour dreams that's I think Point number\none point number two is that there\ndoesn't seem to be a strong correlation\nbetween you remembering your dreams and\nthe quality of the waking day that\nensues as a consequence of that dream\nremembered sleep from the night before\nversus dream nonrem remembered the only\ntime that we've got a little bit of data\ncomes on to what we've spoken about\ntoday which is Lucidity which is a\ndifferent sort of oneup level of\ndreaming there maybe there's some unrest\nsleep argument but for the most part I\nwould say do not worry if you're not\nremembering your dreams it doesn't mean\nthat you are not Dreaming by the way\nI've got a wacky Theory it doesn't mean\nthat you are also not storing those\ndreams and being influenced by them\nthere is something called implicit\nmemory and it was long sort of held you\nknow these versions of you go into a\nmovie theater and for very brief\nmilliseconds of periods of time you're\nshown images of Pepsi cans or Coke cans\nand then during the intermission you\ntrack people's purchasing of soda and\nsure enough they will buy more Pepsi see\nif they get flashed sort of so we can\nactually embed implicit information into\npeople and it changes their behavior\nthey have no recollection of the memory\nbut it's clearly there and it's clearly\ninfluencing the behavior what does this\nhave to do with dreaming I have a theory\nof dreaming where people and I told you\nmost of us forget most of our dreams and\nwe think when we forget those dreams\nhave gone they've evaporated from our\nbrain what if it's not the case have you\never had that experience where you are\nwaking up and you know you are dreaming\nand you just cannot capture it and you\nthink it's gone that's it I've forgotten\nit and then two days later you're in the\nshower you're looking at the shampoo\nbottle and the label all of a sudden\njust unlocks the memory of that dream\nand it comes flooding back as a\nneuroscientist that tells me an\nimportant thing that memory is in\nexistence but previously it was\nunavailable this is the difference\nbetween availability versus\naccessibility the memory was available\nable but you'd lost the IP address to go\nand retrieve it available not accessible\nnow if most of our dreams are still\nalways quote unquote implicitly\nremembered but we always fail to have\naccessibility those memories arguably\naccording to my theory are always\navailable they're always in our brains\nwe just don't have conscious\naccessibility to them that doesn't\nchange the fact that our dreams may\nshape huge amount of our Behavior\nimplicitly and to me that's a wild crazy\nTheory and someday when I retire I'll do\nthe study and try and disprove it anyway\nlove\nit what are the key supplements for\nsleep and I just have to say that's a\nhuge topic that that's an entire episode\nInto You and I should probably do\nintellectual jazz on that at some point\nyeah we should do that but um let's um\nconstrain the question a bit um for sake\nof time um what if any supplements do\nyou personally take or recommend to\npeople um with the understanding that\nmany people perhaps do not need\nsupplements all right we never want to\ngive the impression that that's the\nfirst lined um approach to dealing with\nsleep issues get your sunlight get your\nDarkness get your qqr right all of that\nif it's mysterious to you all of that as\nin the previous episodes of this of this\npodcast series um but assuming that\nsomeone wants to explore this supplement\nspace and uh what do what do you\nrecommend what do you take and please\nhere I'm going to encourage you to not\ntake into consideration at all what I've\never said about supplements for sleep\nbecause I think it's actually most\nuseful if people get a uh a tapestry of\nopinions um please I'm just going to say\nthat outright I don't say maybe you you\ncould say a little bit more about those\nthat you would recommend and and I think\nthey're going to probably overlap\nbecause I already sort of know some of\nthem but sure um the recommend again I\njust want to say that um never take\nanything or remove anything from your\nregimen without talking to your doctor\nfirst but uh and all always always make\nsure that you're doing all the behaviors\ncorrectly first but um and there's so\nmany of them you know don't eat too\nclose to bedtime get your morning\nsunlight on and on you know um but the\nsupplements that I recommend when people\nask and for supplement recommendations\nspecifically are magnesium 3 and\nyep um it's more or less interchangeable\nwith magnesium bisglycinate it has a\nslight sedative property a lot of people\nare deficient in magnesium anyway um and\nthis is Magnesium taken about 30 to 60\nminutes before bedtime the other one is\nappenine which is a essentially a\nderivative of chamomile yep um and then\nthe third is theanine which is known to\nhave a a mild uh anti-anxiety uh\ncomponent to it um the one caveat is\nthat theanine can be problematic for\npeople that have very vivid dreams it\ncan often people say that it makes their\ndreams even more Vivid and so if you\nsuffer from that or it's waking you up\nthen I suggest leaving out the theanine\nactually recommend people start with\njust one thing and then see how it\naffects them and then and then um bring\nmore in I'll put a link in the show note\ncaptions to the dosages that were\ncontained within a zero cost newsletter\nabout sleep rather than listof dosages\nhere and can link to that in the show\nnote captions those are the main three\nand then there's one other which and I\nuse those by the way um most every night\nbefore sleep and it has improved my\nsleep dramatically the other thing that\nI sometimes use is 900 milligrams of\ninositol um which for whatever reason\nhas I find again this is anic data makes\nit easier for me to fall back asleep\nwhen I wake up in the middle of the\nnight especially if I haven't eaten very\nmany starchy carbohydrates in the days\npreceding I try and some starches after\nhard training and things of that sort\nbut sometimes if I'm on a lower\ncarbohydrate regimen then I find it\nextra difficult to sleep so I'll throw\nin some um some anasol um I will say\nthere have been nights where I forget my\nsupplements and just fall asleep and uh\nand so you know it's tough to say\nexactly what each of those is doing and\nin what combinations you always need to\nthink about how much disposable income\nsomebody has again get your behaviors\nright get the dos and don'ts that Matt\ndescribed during the course of this\npodcast series write and then consider\nsupplementation but yeah that's pretty\nmuch what I rely on yeah I like what\nyou're saying um both the philosophy of\nit too because the things that we've\nspoken about the qqr and all the\ndifferent methods they are a log order\nmagnitude greater in terms of how they\nwill cause correct your sleep than\nprobably any supplement effect that I\nknow of to go back to your um magt mag 3\nand8 I think there is some evidence\ndefinitely interesting evidence it was\nmore so in older adults and were able to\nshow increases in the total amount of\ndeep sleep I think it was somewhere\naround about um 15 to 20% although\nthat's the relative percent difference\nif you look I think it was only about\nsix or seven minutes of total deep sleep\nbut there is some evidence there the\nevidence by way of you've heard the\nstory of that magnesium is good for\nsleep it's principally derived from\nevidence of people who are magnesium\ndeficient and when you make them\nmagnesium normative they start sleeping\nbetter that's a very different question\nthan saying I am magnesium normative I\nam in normal ranges and then I add to it\nhow do I expect any greater benefit\nthat's like me saying you know you're at\nan oxygen saturation of\n99.9 and I'm going to give you pure\noxygen it's not going to move you above\n100 you're already at ceiling whereas if\nyou are at 85% and I give you oxygen\nyou're going to get a lovely benefit\nfrom that so but I like mag 3 and8 um\nbecause it is based on the evidence the\nonly one that does cross the blood brain\nbarrier people have said well then why\ndo I get a benefit from things like the\nother one that I would speak about is\nprobably um slow mag because it can be\ntough on some people's tummy and it's a\ncoated uh form of magnesium that doesn't\nnecessarily cross the bloodb brain\nbarrier but um magnesium I would say\nwant to focus on would maybe be\nmagnesium\nchloride that seems maybe Petra has\nreleased a podcast on this too that\nseems to be I think an effective one for\nbio\nbioavailability but if it doesn't cross\nthe blood brain barrier how can it be\naffecting sleep because sleep is of the\nbrain by the brain and for the brain one\nof the reasons is because of muscle\nrelaxation so if you're to tense in your\nbody it feeds signals of stress to your\nbrain and if you're stressed as we've\nspoken about you're not going to sleep\nwell so I think there could be indirect\neffects of forms of magnesium that do\nnot cross the blood brain barrier again\nassuming that you are magnesium\ndeficient I think epogen um chamomile\nhas some good evidence valaran root\nunfortunately if you look at the state\nthe data it doesn't seem to hold up in\nterms of any sleep benefit whatsoever\nprobably two that I would add to that\nlist the first is glycine and here we're\ntalking about doses of maybe 1.5 to two\nGams of glycine has quite a reliable\nrobust literature now it's not\nrandomized control Trials of a level of\na drug because these are supplements you\ndon't get those studies but it does seem\nto have quite a reli will benefit based\non what I've seen in the literature the\nfinal one I would say which has very\ngood data to support its action is\nsomething called phosed sarine phosph\nserine and again I've got no association\nwith any supplement company whatsoever\nbut this has been reliably demonstrated\nto Tamp down the cortisol response now\nthat data you've got to be careful if\nyou look at it and read the studies\nwhich I have it's principally in\nathletes and they use an athletic\nperformance intervention to Brute Force\ncortisol to go up and then they use this\nmedication and it brings it back down\nbut it is reliable I bring this up\nbecause we spoke about in our one of our\nepisodes insomnia patients as they're\ntrying to fall asleep cortisol is coming\ndown just like it is in all healthy\npeople and it drops low just as we're\nabout to fall asleep but in insomnia\npatients it spikes back up again and\nthen it does in the middle of the night\nso here is a medication that one could\ntry to try to temp down that cortisol\nspecifically as you're going into sleep\nand that may be of helped too so those\nare the only two that I would give with\nthe same caveat that get everything else\nstraight stop worrying about buying\nsupplements and thinking it's going to\nbe a quick fix get the basics in place\nand then we can think about fine-tuning\nyou for the final couple of percent\noptimization that you get from\nsupplements terrific\nanswer the final question h of this\nSixth and\nfinal episode of this podcast series on\nsleep with Dr Matthew Walker I'm so sad\nI don't want to leave I don't want to\nstop speaking about we can always do\nanother I would love the literature\nchanges it evolves it um we can do\nanother and another is the following if\nyou could give just one tip for getting\nbetter sleep what would that\nbe\nregularity just keep things regular if\nyou get regular sleep a lot of things\nwill start to take care of themselves\nand after that if they don't we'll have\nanother conversation and we'll go back\nto the other three keys the other three\nof the four macros of sleep quantity\nquality and regularity as I've spoken\nabout in timing and then all of the\nother protocols that we've mentioned but\nstart with regularity get that straight\nand I would also say you're timing to\nthe r and the T of qqr T figure out your\nchronotype get good with your chronotype\nas best you can and then get regular if\nyou do those two things sleep in\nsynchrony with your chronotype rather\nthan against it and you are being\nregular weekdays and weekends you will\nget a long way to getting better sleep\nfantastic well I'll put one in if you\ncould give just one tip for getting\nbetter sleep what would it be I suggest\nyou listen to all six episodes of The\nhberman Lab podcast guest series with Dr\nMatthew Walker about sleep and ways to\nimprove sleep because episode one covers\nthe biology and the basics of how to get\nbetter sleep and what sleep is episode\ntwo gets into the more advanced tools\nalthough I think they are tools that\neveryone I know they are tools that\neveryone can and should consider episode\nthree gets into the power of naps\ncaffeine food and the timing of those oh\nso\npowerful episode four gets into the role\nof sleep in learning memory and\ncreativity what's more interesting than\nthat episode five we discussed sleep and\nits impact on emotional health and\nmental health and today we were\ndiscussing dreaming and lucid dreaming\nand here is where I get to say Dr\nMatthew Walker thank you oh so much oh\nso much for giving us a absolutely\nworldclass grand tour of this incredible\naspect of Our Lives that we call\nsleep and in doing so also making it\nextremely clear extremely actionable at\nevery step and very very thorough in a\nway that really honors the interest and\nintellect\nand just real sincere interest in this\ntopic on the part of the audience so I\ncould not think of a single better\nperson for this series than you alive or\ndead
