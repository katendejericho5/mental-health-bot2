    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to discuss sugar,\nin particular, how our\nnervous system regulates\nour sugar intake and our\nare seeking of sugar.\nWe're also going to discuss how sugar\nregulates our nervous system.\nAnd as you'll soon learn,\nsugar really impacts our brain and body\nby two main mechanisms.\nOne of those mechanisms is based on\nthe sweet taste of sugar,\nwhich itself is rewarding.\nEven if you're not much of a sweet tooth,\nI confess I'm not,\nmost people enjoy sweet tastes\nmore than bitter tastes.\nAnd the sweet taste of\nsugar and its various forms,\nis strongly reinforcing,\nmeaning it triggers the\nactivation of neurons,\nnerve cells in the brain and body,\nthat make us want to consume\nmore of that sweet substance.\nIncidentally, sweet tastes also\nmake us want to eat more of\nother substances as well.\nYou may be familiar with that phenomenon.\nNow sugar also triggers\nmechanisms in the brain and body\nbased on its nutritive content,\nindependent of its sweetness.\nWhat that means is that\nthe actual caloric content\nand the way that sugar interacts\nwith your nervous system\nat a subconscious level,\nwithout your awareness,\nalso impacts your craving and seeking\nof sugar and other foods.\nToday, we are going to\ndiscuss what happens\nwhen you ingest sugar in\nterms of your body's reaction\nand your brain's reaction.\nWe are also going to\ntalk about what happens\nwhen you don't ingest enough sugar.\n'Cause it turns out sugar\nis such a powerful fuel\nfor the brain\nthat under conditions\nwhere people don't ingest\nenough sugar, or where their\nso-called blood glucose,\nwhich is basically blood\nsugar of a particular form\ngets too low, their neurons\ndon't function as well.\nThat said, there are conditions\nof very low blood sugar\nin which neurons can function even better.\nSo today we are going to\ntalk about the ins and outs,\nthe ups and downs of sugar\nas it relates to your nervous system.\nAnd by the end of this episode,\nI'm confident that you\nhave a much clearer picture\nas to how much sugar\nyou should be ingesting,\nwhether or not you should avoid sugars\nthat you're currently eating,\nand you will certainly\nunderstand much, much more\nabout the energy and fuel sources\nthat your brain relies on,\nwhich I'm certain will allow you to make\nbetter informed choices about\nthe foods you eat and avoid\ntoward mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nI'm hosting two live events\nthis May.\nThe first live event will be\nhosted in Seattle, Washington\non May 17th.\nThe second live event will be hosted\nin Portland, Oregon on May 18th.\nBoth are part of a lecture series entitled\nThe Brain-Body Contract,\nduring which I will discuss\nscience and science based tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nAnd I should point out that\nwhile some of the material\nI'll cover will overlap with\ninformation covered here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nand on various social media posts.\nMost of the information I will\ncover is going to be distinct\nfrom information covered on\nthe podcast or elsewhere.\nSo once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,\nPortland on May 18th,\nyou can access tickets by\ngoing to Hubermanlab.com/tour.\nAnd I hope to see you there.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes what are called nootropics,\nwhich means smart drugs.\nNow, to be honest,\nI am not a fan of the term nootropics,\nI don't believe in smart drugs\nin the sense that I don't believe\nthat there's any one substance\nor collection of substances\nthat can make us smarter.\nI do believe, based on science, however,\nthat there are particular neural circuits\nand brain functions that\nallow us to be more focused,\nmore alert, access creativity,\nbe more motivated, et cetera.\nThat's just the way that the brain works,\ndifferent neural circuits\nfor different brain states.\nAnd so the idea of a nootropic\nthat's to make us smarter\nall around,\nfails to acknowledge that\nsmarter is many things.\nIf you're an artist, you're a musician,\nyou're doing math,\nyou're doing accounting,\nat different parts of the\nday, you need to be creative.\nThese are all different brain processes.\nThesis understands this.\nAnd as far as I know they're\nthe first nootropics company\nto create targeted nootropics\nfor specific outcomes.\nThey only use the highest\nquality ingredients,\nwhich of course is essential.\nSome of those I've talked\nabout on the podcast,\nthings like DHA, Ginkgo\nbiloba, phosphatidylserine.\nThey give you the ability to\ntry several different blends\nover the course of a month,\ndiscover which nootropics work best\nfor your unique brain chemistry\nand genetics and goals.\nAnd with that personalization,\ndesign a kit of nootropics\nthat's ideal for the different\nbrain and body states\nyou want to access.\nI've been using Thesis for\nmore than six months now,\nand I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nhave been a total game changer.\nMy go-to formula is the Clarity Formula,\nor sometimes I'll use their\nEnergy Formula, before training.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to take thesis.com/huberman.\nTake a three minute quiz\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman\ncheckout for 10% off\nyour first order.\nToday's episode is also brought to us\nby Athletic Greens, now called AG1.\nAthletic Greens is an all in one\nvitamin, mineral and probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day is\nthat it helps me cover\nall of my basic nutritional needs.\nIt makes up for any\ndeficiencies that I might have.\nIn addition, it has probiotics,\nwhich are vital for microbiome health.\nI've done a couple of\nepisodes now on the so-called\ngut microbiome and in the ways in which\nthe microbiome interacts\nwith your immune system,\nwith your brain to regulate mood,\nand essentially with\nevery biological system\nrelevant to health throughout\nyour brain and body.\nWith Athletic Greens, I\nget the vitamins I need,\nthe minerals I need,\nand the probiotics to\nsupport my microbiome.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it easy to\nmix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road.\nPlus a years supply of Vitamin D3+K2.\nThere are ton of data now\nshowing that vitamin D3\nis essential for various aspects\nof our brain and body health.\nEven if we're getting a lot of sunshine,\nmany of us are still\ndeficient in vitamin D3.\nAnd K2 is also important\nbecause it regulates things like\ncardiovascular function,\ncalcium in the body, and so on.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim the special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of Vitamin D3+K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long term health\ncan only be assessed with\na quality blood test.\nWhat's unique about InsideTracker\nis that while there are a lot\nof different tests out there\nfor hormones and metabolic\nfactors, et cetera,\nwith InsideTracker,\nyou get the numbers back\nin terms of your levels,\nbut they also give you\nvery clear directives\nin terms of lifestyle,\nnutrition, and supplementation,\nthat can help you bring\nthose values into the ranges\nthat are best for you\nand your health goals.\nAnd that's very different than\na lot of the other programs\nwhere you get a lot of information,\nbut you don't really know what\nto do with that information.\nInsideTracker makes that\nall very easy to understand\nand very actionable based\non the very easy to use\ndashboard at InsideTracker.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit inside tracker.com/huberman,\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nOkay, let's talk about sugar,\nlet's talk about how\nsugar impacts your brain,\nand how your brain impacts\nyour pursuit or your avoidance\nof sugar.\nLet's get a few things\nout of the way first.\nThe first thing is that there's nothing\ninherently bad about sugar.\nI know the word sugar\ngets a bad rap nowadays,\nand indeed, you're going to\nhear over and over again,\nduring this podcast,\nthat consuming a lot of refined sugars,\nin particular high fructose corn syrup,\nis known to have a very\nlarge number of bad effects\non the brain and body.\nI don't know that there's anyone\nthat really debates that anymore.\nEven if we just agree, and\nI think we should all agree,\non the so-called calories in,\ncalories out principle, right?\nIt's a principle thermodynamics\nthat if we ingest more\nenergy than we burn,\nwe are going to gain weight.\nIf we ingest less energy than we burn,\nwe are generally going to lose weight.\nAnd if the two things are in balance,\ningestion and burning of energy,\nwell, then we're going to maintain weight.\nSo everyone agrees on\nthat, I agree on that.\nBut beyond, there are a number of ways\nin which particular nutrients,\nin the case of today's episode, sugar,\nimpact the way that the brain works,\nsuch that we tend to seek out\nmore of particular nutrients.\nFor instance, if we eat sugar,\nthere are two, or at least two mechanisms,\nby which we will crave more sugar.\nI think most people are\naware of that experience,\nbut today I'm going to explain\nexactly how that works.\nBut also that when we ingest sugar\nit has a bunch of different effects\non the way that our neural circuits work\nthat can allow us to be\nmore or less focused,\nmore or less agitated,\na more or less happy,\nmore or less depressed in some cases.\nSo today, as we explore this\nthing we're calling sugar,\nwe are going to explore\nthat mainly in the context\nof the nervous system,\nbut also in the context of how\nthe nervous system regulates\nmany, many functions and behaviors\nthat are important to all of you,\nyour ability to think,\nyour ability to extra size,\nyour ability to gain weight, lose weight,\nwhatever your goals might happen to be,\nsugar plays a critical role\nin achieving those goals.\nAnd in some cases,\nif you're ingesting too\nmuch at the wrong times\nor the wrong forms, sugar can\nactually impede those goals.\nIn fact, sugar can prevent\nall the right behaviors\nfrom allowing you to achieve\nthe goals that you want.\nSo today we are going to place sugar\ninto its proper context.\nThe way I want to start off by doing that\nis to tell you a little bit\nof what happens when we eat\nand a little bit of what the brain does\nto respond to those events.\nSo what happens when we eat?\nWell, I've done an entire\nepisode on metabolism.\nSo if you're interested\nin the full cascade\nof hormonal and neural events\nthat occurs when we eat,\nplease check out that episode.\nBut for the sake of today's discussion,\nlet's just take a, what\nI call top contour view\nof the hormonal response\nto ingesting food.\nNow, anytime we eat,\nthat is the consequence\nof a number of things\nthat happened before we ate.\nThere's a own in our\nbrain body called Ghrelin,\nspelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.\nGhrelin is a hormone that increases\ndepending on how long it's\nbeen since we ate last.\nSo the longer it's been\nsince we had a meal,\nGhrelin levels are going to be\nhigher and higher and higher,\nand it essentially makes us hungry\nby interacting with particular neurons\nin an area of the brain called\nthe arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus\nand some other areas as well,\nlike the lateral hypothalamus.\nYou don't need to know the\nnames of those brain areas,\nbut if you'd like to\nknow them, there they are\nGhrelin increases, it\ntends to make us hungry.\nAnd then when we eat,\ntypically what happens is\nGhrelin levels go down.\nSo it's a very logical system.\nNow, when we eat, assuming\nthat we eat carbohydrates,\nbut even if we just eat\nsome protein and some fats,\nwe will experience a\nslight, or in some cases,\na large rise in blood glucose,\nblood glucose is simply blood sugar.\nAnd the body and brain, we\nshould say in particular,\nthe nervous system doesn't function well\nif blood sugar is too high or too low.\nSo as a consequence, we\nhave another hormone,\nwhich is released from the pancreas,\nwhich is called insulin,\nwhich helps regulate the amount of glucose\nin the bloodstream.\nSo even if you were to\ningest an entire cup,\nan eight ounce cup of pure table sugar,\nwhich would send your blood\nglucose very, very high,\nassuming that you have a\nnormal insulin response,\nthat you're not diabetic,\nthat insulin response would help clamp\nthat blood glucose level\nso that it did not cause\ndamage to your brain and body.\nBecause if blood sugar goes too high,\nit's actually toxic to neurons\nand other cells of your body,\nit can kill them off.\nAnd neurons of the central nervous system,\nmeaning the brain and spinal cord,\nonce they are dead, they do not come back.\nSo your biological systems understand this\nat a biological level that is,\nand prevent that death of\ncells due to high blood sugar,\nby keeping insulin around,\nin order to clamp blood glucose.\nDiabetics, we call them\ntype one diabetics,\nwho don't make insulin,\nhave to take insulin when\nthey eat in particular,\nwhen they eat foods that\nraise their blood sugar,\nspecifically to avoid that neurotoxicity\nand the other deleterious\neffects of high blood sugar.\nSo Ghrelin is a hormone that goes up\nthe longer it's been since we've eaten,\nit tends to stimulate hunger.\nWhen we eat, Ghrelin is suppressed.\nBlood glucose typically goes up,\nespecially when we eat a\ncarbohydrate containing meal.\nWhen blood glucose goes up,\nit's regulated in the body,\nmeaning its peaks and its valleys\nare more or less smoothed out,\nand that glucose is sequestered,\nit's taken away where it\nneeds to be taken away.\nAnd in certain locations,\nit's delivered to cells\nso that those cells can use the glucose.\nNow, one of the chief organs\nfor glucose utilization\nis the brain,\nneurons are tremendously\nmetabolically active.\nAnd their preferred mode of metabolism\nis glucose metabolism.\nIn other words, neurons\nbasically run on sugar,\nwhich is not to say that you\nshould eat a lot of sugar.\nAs you'll see today, there\nare states of mind and body,\nfor instance, fasted states,\nin which people report\nhaving immense amounts\nof mental clarity and their blood glucose\nis actually quite low.\nSo it is simply not the\ncase that the more sugar\nthat you ingest, the better\nthat your brain will function.\nBut it is the case that for most people,\nmeaning people who are not on a ketogenic\nor very low carbohydrate diet,\nthey're not adapted to\nlow carbohydrate diets,\nthat neurons in their brain and body\nare using glucose in order to function.\nThat's what allows those neurons\nto fire electrical potentials,\nthat's how we refer to it,\nfiring, meaning sending electrical\nsignals down their length\nto communicate with other neurons.\nTo illustrate just how\nimportant glucose is\nfor brain function,\nI'd like to describe a study\nthat just recently came out,\nthat sits on a long\nhistory of similar studies.\nBut the one that just came out\nis particularly interesting.\nNow I want to point out\nthat, unless I say otherwise,\nI'm going to refer to typical diets,\nmeaning I have to believe\nthat most people out there\nare in ingesting some starch\nsome starch or carbohydrate.\nI do realize there are people following\nvery low carbohydrate diets\nor moderately carbohydrate diets.\nI even know that there's\nsome folks out there\nwho are on the so-called carnivore diet,\nthey only eat meat and\norgans, maybe a little fruit.\nBut I'm going to assume\nthat the vast majority\nof people listening ingest\nproteins and carbohydrates.\nSo unless I say ketogenic, or\nI emphasize ketosis itself,\nwhich I will,\nI'm referring to a kind of typical diet\nwhere people are consuming fats,\nproteins and carbohydrates.\nI count myself as one such individual.\nAt some point I might try the\ncarnivore diet, who knows,\nI might I a pure vegan diet, who knows.\nBut for my entire life up\nuntil now, I'm 46 years old,\nI've been a proud omnivore,\nmeaning I've tried to eat\nhigh quality as much as I can,\nunprocessed foods,\nI try and really avoid\nhighly processed foods.\nBut I do eat from those\nthree macronutrient groups,\nproteins, carbohydrates, and fats,\nand I'm going to assume\nthat most of you do as well.\nThe study I'd like to emphasize,\nrecorded from neurons, nerve cells,\nin the brain, in particular\nin the part of the brain\n`that responds to visual images,\nthe so called visual cortex.\nAnd neurons in the visual\ncortex are beautifully tuned,\nas we say, to particular\nfeatures of what we see.\nThe primary example of this,\nthe kind of classic example,\nis if you put a little\nelectrode next to a neuron\nin your visual cortex,\nor if we put you into\nan FMRI scanner machine,\nwhich can detect neural activity,\nand I were to show you a\nbunch of just little lines,\nbars of light, they could\nbe dark bars of light,\nthey could be light bars of light,\non a screen in front of you.\nSo some would be vertical,\nsome would be horizontal,\nsome would be at 45 degrees,\nwhat we would see is that\nsome neurons respond best,\nmeaning they fire a lot\nof electrical activity\nto vertical lines,\nother ones respond to horizontal lines,\nand others respond to 45 degree lines.\nAnd this so called orientation tuning,\nmeaning because of the\norientation of the line,\nis a cardinal classic feature of the way\nthat your visual system is built.\nAnd everything that you see,\nwhether it's a face or a\ndog or a cat or a landscape,\nis built up from these very\nsimple neuron responses.\nIn other words, when you look at a face,\nthere are neurons deep in the\nbrain that respond to faces.\nBut the only reason that those neurons\ncan respond to those faces\nis because they receive\nsignals from neurons\nin your visual cortex.\nSome of which respond to vertical lines,\nsome of which respond to horizontal lines,\nand some which respond to 45 degree lines.\nAnd all of those are built up\nin what we call a\nhierarchical representation,\nwhich just fancy language for\nthose are the building blocks\nby which you see a face\nand you recognize a face.\nAnd it's really an amazing phenomenon,\nit happens very, very fast.\nYou never notice that you're doing this,\nbut everything is built up from these\nfundamental orientation-tuned neurons.\nNow orientation-tuned\nneurons are so fundamental\nthat they are the building blocks\nby which you make up all\nother things that you see,\nit's the way you read,\nit's the way that you recognize\nfaces, as I mentioned,\nand everything else.\nExperimentally, it's quite straightforward\nto measure how sharply tuned\none of these neurons is.\nIn other words, if I were\nto show you a vertical line\nand find a neuron in your brain\nthat responds to vertical lines,\nI could also ask whether\nor not that neuron fires\nany electrical activity\nin response to a line\nthat's not quite vertical,\nmaybe just 10 degrees off\nvertical or 20 degrees\nor 30 degrees.\nAnd what I eventually would\nfind is that that neuron\nwas orientation-tuned over a\nparticular range of angles.\nIt's not only going to\nrespond to vertical lines,\nit's also going to respond to lines\nthat are about 10 degrees\noff vertical on either side,\nbut probably not much more, maybe 20,\nbut usually it's going to\nbe anywhere from vertical\nto just tilted slightly.\nIn the recent experiment\nthat was published\nin the journal, \"Neuron,\"\nCell Press journal,\nexcellent journal,\nthe authors asked a really\ninteresting question,\nthey asked whether or not\nthe sharpness of tuning,\nthe precision of orientation\ntuning of these neurons\nis dependent on blood glucose level.\nSo just to cut to the chase,\nto give you the answer,\nwhat they found is that\nwhen subjects are well fed,\nneurons that responded to vertical,\nresponded very strongly to vertical,\nbut not very much at all to other angles,\nof what we call stimuli,\nso lines that are 10\ndegrees or 20 degrees off.\nIf they looked at neurons that\nwere primarily tuned, right,\nthat preferred horizontal lines,\nthey found the same thing.\nSo it wasn't something\nunique to vertical lines.\nWhat they basically\nfound was the sharpness,\nthe precision of tuning\nof neurons in the brain,\nwas best when subjects were fed.\nAnd conversely, when subjects were fasted,\nthe orientation tuning of these\nneurons became much broader.\nWhat it meant was that a neuron\nthat normally would\nonly respond to vertical\nnow responded to other\nangles of lines as well.\nYou might say, well, that's great, right,\nthese neurons that at one\npoint could only do one thing\nare now tuned to other things.\nBut it's not so great\nbecause what that means\nis that in the fasted state,\nyour perception of the outside\nworld is actually distorted,\nit's blurred, it's not as\nprecise as it is when you're fed.\nAnd when I say fed,\nwhat I really mean is when\nglucose is available to neurons.\nNow, for some of you, maybe many of you,\nand including myself,\nintermittent fasting,\nor some variant thereof, is\nactually a state that I like.\nIt allows me to focus.\nFor instance, as I mentioned before,\nand even earlier in this podcast,\nI tend to eat my first meal\nsometime around 11:00 AM.\nAnd then I generally eat my last meal\nsometime around 8:00 PM,\nplus or minus an hour\non either side, I'm not\nsuper strict about it.\nAnd occasionally I'll\nwake up really hungry\nand I'll eat something before 11:00 AM.\nI'm not super strict about this\nintermittent fasting thing.\nIt just seems to be how\nmy appetite works best,\ngiven my schedule, et cetera.\nIn the morning, I tend to be most focused.\nAnd I always associated that with the fact\nthat I was fasted.\nI ingest water and some caffeine about\n90 minutes after waking\nup, I drink my caffeine,\nbut I hydrate from the time I\nget up, et cetera, et cetera.\nAnd I know a lot of other people\nhave had the experience of being fasted\nand feeling like they have\na lot of mental clarity.\nWhen you are in a fasted state,\ntypically you are going to use fuels\nthat are available to the neurons,\nbased on your intake\nof food the day before,\nmaybe you're using some glycogen,\nmaybe you're using some fat,\nmaybe you're using some blood sugar,\nthat's derived from other\nstorage sites in the body.\nYou don't actually use\nfat as a fuel source\nfor neurons under typical conditions.\nBut there are ways in\nwhich proteins and fats\nand glycogen, et cetera,\nare converted into fuel\nthat neurons can use.\nWhat's interesting about this study\nis that the study says that when well fed,\nmeaning when blood glucose, sugar,\nis at a properly elevated\nlevel in the bloodstream,\nit can be delivered to the brain\nin a way that allows neurons to work best,\nwhich is really all just\nto underscore the point\nthat I made earlier,\nwhich is that your nervous system\nis extremely metabolically\ndemanding, and it loves glucose,\nneurons love glucose.\nSo the takeaway from this study\nis not that you should avoid fasting,\nthe takeaway from this study\nis that there are elements\nof the fasted state\nin particular the elevations in things\nlike epinephrine and norepinephrine,\nalso called adrenaline and noradrenaline,\nthat can give us this\nkind of clarity of mind\nthat many people are\npursuing when they fast.\nThat's kind of one of the\nreasons a lot of people fast,\nthey like the way that they\nfeel, mentally and physically.\nBut I think it's only fair to point out\nthat glucose is the preferred\nsource of fuel for the brain.\nAnd this study that I mentioned\nis one of many studies\nthat have explored how nutritional status\nor blood glucose status\nin the brain and body\ninfluence neuronal tuning\nand neuronal function.\nAnd it really points to\nthe fact that ultimately,\nyour brain as an organ, is\na glucose consuming machine.\nNow, when you eat a food,\nthat food is broken down and\nif it contains carbohydrates,\nit's going to be converted into glucose.\nAnd that glucose can't get\ndirectly into the brain\nas a fuel source.\nIt actually has to be carried across\nthe so-called blood\nbrain barrier, the BBB,\nand the actual metabolism of glucose\nand the delivery of the\nglucose to the neurons\nis carried out by a different cell type.\nAnd it's a cell type that\nyou should all know about\nbecause it's the most abundant\ncell type in your brain,\nand maybe even in your\nentire nervous system,\nand that's the so-called astrocyte.\nAstrocytes are one of\nseveral types of glia,\nthe word glia means glue.\nBut many people have taken\nthat name, glia, glue,\nto think that, oh,\nthe only thing that the\nastrocytes are doing\nis just kind of holding things together.\nActually, the astrocytes\nare involved in delivering\nglucose to the neurons,\nthey are critically involved in shaping\nyour neuronal function\nand brain plasticity,\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nSo these astrocytes are like the little\nwaiters and waitresses\nbringing glucose to the neurons\nand the neurons are going\nto do the heavy lifting\nthat's involved in perception\nand behavior and action.\nSo if prior to this episode,\nyou didn't already realize\nthat glucose, blood sugar,\nis vital to the function of your brain\nand other neurons of your\nnervous system, now you know.\nAnd for those of you that have experienced\nthe increase in mental clarity\nthat comes after a properly\ntimed, properly composed,\nmeaning it has the right\nmacronutrients in the right ratios,\nand a properly sized meal,\nwell then now you have justification\nfor eating something as\na way to improve the way\nthat your brain works.\nIt turns out that your\nbrain is going to work best\nwhen it's got glucose available,\nwhether you like to fast or not,\nthat's just the reality of things.\nThe same thing is also true\nfor the neurons in your body.\nThe way that you are able to\nmove the limbs of your body,\nthe way you are able to perform exercise\nor movement of any kind for that matter,\nis because as neurons,\ncalled motor neurons,\nsend electrical potentials\nto the muscle fibers,\nthey release a neurotransmitter\ncalled acetylcholine,\nwhich causes contraction\nin the muscle fibers,\nand allows you to move your limbs.\nThose neurons are also very\nmetabolically demanding,\nespecially when you're doing\ndemanding types of physical work,\nand that could be cycling\nor running or weightlifting\nor yoga or whatever it may be.\nThose neurons require a ton of glucose.\nIf you've ever had the\nexperience of having to\nthink very hard about how\nyou're generating a movement\nor force yourself to continue\nto endure in a given exercise,\nyou might have thought,\noh, you know, I'm running out of fuel,\nthat's why I'm getting\ntired, it's hard to do.\nThat's actually the case sometimes,\nbut that's not always the case.\nOne of the reasons that it feels like work\nis because your so called\nupper motor neurons,\nthe ones that control\nthe lower motor neurons\nin your spinal cord, which\ncontrol your muscles,\nthey have to be very metabolically active.\nIt's one thing to engage\nin a reflexive movement\nwhere you're just walking around\nor if you're running continuously.\nBut when you suddenly have to\nfocus on what you're doing,\nand you have to generate specific patterns\nof motor movement,\nwell, that feels demanding because one,\nit increases the release of adrenaline\nin your brain and body,\nwhich makes you feel a little\nbit agitated and more alert,\nbut also deliberate thought,\ndeliberately controlling the way\nthat your brain and body is moving,\nrequires more glucose uptake,\nmore energy in those very neurons.\nAnd this is also why after\ndoing a long about of exercise,\nyou might be tired,\nbut also if you do a about of\nskill learning of any kind,\nor if you've been reading\nand thinking about\nwhat you're reading,\nor if you had a intense\nconversation with somebody\nwhere you're really\nforcing yourself to listen,\nand hopefully they're\nlistening to you too,\nand you're really trying to\nparse what they're saying,\nand maybe you're doing that right now,\nand you're trying to really\ntrack something, that's work,\nand that work requires\nglucose uptake by neurons,\nboth in the brain and in your body.\nNow that we've established that glucose\nis the preferred source of\nfuel for the nervous system,\nI'd like to concentrate on\na few of the other types of\nsugars that we ingest on a common basis,\nand the impact that those have\non brain function and body function.\nI'd particularly like\nto focus on fructose.\nFructose, of course, is found in fruit,\nit's also found in the infamous\nhigh fructose corn syrup,\nwhich we will talk about today.\nIt's worth pointing out\nthat the concentrations\nof fructose in fruit\nis quite low compared to the\nconcentrations of fructose\nin high fructose corn syrup.\nHigh fructose corn syrup is\napproximately 50% fructose,\nwhich turns out to be\nan enormously high percentage\nof anything, really,\nespecially when we cut contrast that\nto the concentrations\nof fructose in fruit.\nFruits have other types\nof sugars in them as well.\nYou know, the sucrose\ncontent of most fruit\nand fruit juices is low.\nAlthough there are some\nfruits like melons, peaches,\npineapples, and so forth,\nthat contain a little less\nthan 10% or so of sucrose.\nThings like mangoES can\nhave a lot of sucrose.\nBut typically the amount of fructose,\nfructose, I think is the\nproper pronunciation,\npeople are always correcting me.\nFructose is anywhere from\n1% to about 10%, right?\nIt's really going to vary quite a bit.\nAnd many of you have probably heard\nof the so-called glycemic index,\nwhich is basically a measure\nof how fast blood sugar rises\nafter eating particular foods, et cetera.\nWe're going to set aside\nthe glycemic index for now,\nwe will come back to it.\nIt has some relationship\nto the concentrations\nof fructose in fruit.\nBut the point that I'd like to make\nis that fructose as a sugar,\nis handled very differently\nin the body than is glucose.\nBut I also want to emphasize that\nbecause the percentage of\nfructose in fruit is rather low,\nespecially compared to\nhigh fructose corn syrup,\nmany people have demonized fructose\nsaying that fructose makes you fat,\nor that fruit makes you fat.\nIf you look at the data,\nthat's not really the case.\nThe fact of the matter is that\nthe concentrations of fructose in fruit\nare so low that unless someone\nis consuming a lot of fruit,\nor they're consuming a lot of fruit\non the backdrop of a highly processed diet\nor a diet that has a lot of other stuff\nthat they might not want to be ingesting,\nyou can't really say that\nfructose is fattening.\nI don't really think that\nthere's any basis for saying that\nfructose itself is bad.\nNow high fructose corn\nsyrup is a different issue,\nand too much consumption of\nanything, fructose included,\nwhether or not it comes\nfruit or otherwise,\ncan be a problem for\nthe ways that it impacts\nthe neural circuits that process sugar,\nnot just glucose, but fructose.\nAnd so we'll illustrate those\nneural circuits in a bit,\nand it'll become very clear to all of you,\nregardless of whether or not\nyou have a background in\nbiology or metabolism,\nnutrition, or otherwise,\nwhy ingesting very high\nconcentrations of fructose\nis not going to be a good thing\nfor the way that your brain functions.\nOne of the key distinctions\nbetween glucose and fructose\nis that fructose most likely\ncannot directly access the brain.\nIt actually needs to be converted\ninto glucose in the liver.\nAnd the way that conversion occurs\nfeeds back to a set of\nhormones and neural pathways\nthat we talked about earlier,\nwhich have a lot to do with appetite.\nAnd to just summarize what is\nnow a lot of very solid data,\nfructose and specifically fructose,\nhas the ability to reduce\ncertain hormones and peptides\nin our body whose main job\nis to suppress Ghrelin.\nAs you recall, Ghrelin is\na hormone that increases\nthe longer it's been since we've eaten,\nand Ghrelin makes us hungry\nby stimulating particular\nneurons in our hypothalamus,\nit actually makes us really want to eat.\nAnd in particular, really\nmakes us want to eat sugary\nand fatty foods.\nFructose reduces the\nactivity of the hormones\nthat reduce Ghrelin .\nAnd so the net consequence of that\nis that fructose increases Ghrelin.\nSo, although I and I think\npretty much everyone out there,\nsay for a few individuals,\nagrees that calories in and calories out\nis the fundamental\nprinciple of weight loss,\nweight maintenance or weight gain.\nIngesting fructose shifts\nour hormone system,\nand as a consequence, our neural\npathways within our brain,\nthe hypothalamus,\nto be hungrier regardless of\nhow many calories we've eaten.\nNow I also want to be absolutely clear,\nthis does not mean that eating\nan apple or eating a melon\nor eating a couple of\napricots or something\nis going to make you hyperphagic,\nmeaning it's going to\nmake you just want to\neat, eat, and eat, that's\nsimply not the case.\nBut if you compare fructose\nand you compare glucose,\nnot only are they metabolized differently\nin the brain and body,\nbut in addition to that,\nfructose has this impact\nof reducing the hormones\nthat reduce hunger hormones\nin neural circuits.\nAnd so fructose does\nhave this kind of twist\nin its phenotype, right?\nOr I guess if fructose\nhad a dating profile,\nthis would be a kind of a\nred flag in that profile,\nbecause fructose itself,\nwhile it's actually a pretty\ngood fuel source in many ways,\nand it's often packaged\nin things like fruits,\nwhich bring along fiber\nand vitamins and minerals,\nthat I think for many of us are things\nthat we should be eating more\nof and ingesting more of,\nit can suppress the pathways\nthat suppress hunger.\nAnd as a consequence,\nit can increase hunger.\nSo current recommendations for most people\nare to eat more fruits and vegetables.\nBut for those of you that are\ntrying to control your hunger,\ningesting a lot of fruit to\nis probably not going to be\na good idea.\nCertainly, ingesting it from\nhigh fructose corn syrup\nis not going to be a good idea\nbecause of the enormous\npercentages of fructose\nin high fructose corn syrup,\n50%, or sometimes even more.\nBut even from fruit,\nsome people will find that fruit\nreally quenches their appetite.\nOther people will find that\nfruit stimulates their appetite.\nAnd I suppose if you're trying\nto stimulate your appetite,\nthen ingesting more fruit\nmight actually be advantageous\nto you.\nSo fructose provides a bridge for us\nbetween a particular kind\nof sugar, hormone function,\nin this case Ghrelin and the hypothalamus.\nwhich leads us to the next question,\nwhich is what is it about sugar\nthat makes it such an\nattractive thing for us?\nWhy do we like it so much?\nAnd the obvious answer that\nmost people arrive at is,\nwell, it just tastes really, really good.\nBut that's actually not the way it works.\nThe rewarding property\nis as we say of sugar,\nwhether or not they come in\nthe form of sucrose or fructose\nor foods that increase\nglucose to a very high level,\nactually is not just related\nto the taste of the foods\nthat produce that elevation\nin glucose, sucrose, or fructose.\nIt is in part, but that's\nonly part of the story,\nand the rest of the story,\nonce you understand it,\ncan actually place you in a\nposition to much better control\nyour sugar intake of all kinds,\nbut also your food intake\nin ways that can allow you\nto make much better choices\nabout the foods you ingest.\nAnd actually at this point,\nI should probably give a confession,\nI've said today, and I'll say it again,\nand I've said it I'm pretty podcast.\nI don't have much of a sweet\ntooth and indeed that's true.\nAnd I can kind of pass\non chocolate or ice cream\nor things like that,\nit seems like with each successive year,\nsweet things are less\nand less appealing to me.\nOf course, savory foods,\nanything that is really fatty,\nsalty, savory, those don't\nlast long in my presence,\nbut I always say, I don't really\nlike sweet things so much,\nand I like sweet people,\nbut I don't tend to like\nsweet foods, which is true.\nBut there's probably one\nexception and that's mangoes.\nAnd it turns out that mangoes\nhave the highest percentage\nof sugar in them,\nin particular fructose, as\nwell as other forms of sugars.\nSo what I do, because\nI love mango so much,\nis I will have mangoes\nprobably twice a week,\nbut I'll have them after some\nsort of resistance training\nor hard run or something like that.\nBecause it is the case that\nafter you exercise hard,\nin particular exercise that is\nof the high intensity variety,\nthat your body is more efficient\nat using circulating sugar.\nIt's able to store that\nor use that for fuel.\nAnd so what I'll typically\ndo is just take the mango,\nI actually eat the peels too.\nI know there probably some\npeople are going to cringe\nwhen they hear that,\nI find them delicious.\nSo I'll just bite into\nthose things like apples,\nI don't eat the pits, however.\nSo now I want to take us on a journey\ninto the nervous system to explain,\nthe pathways in the brain and body\nthat regulate our appetite for sugar.\nNow, keep in mind what I\nalready told you before,\nwhich is that when we ingest foods,\nthey're broken down\ninto various components\nand glucose is going to\nbe shuttled to the brain,\nand of course, to other\nneurons in our spinal cord\nand elsewhere, and to our muscles, cetera,\nin order for all of those\ncells and organs and tissues\nis to be able to function.\nThe fact that so many cells\nand organs and tissues\nrequire glucose in order to function\nhas led to a situation where you have\ndedicated neural machinery,\npieces of your brain,\nthat are almost entirely,\nif not entirely devoted,\nto seeking out of sugar or\nfoods that contain sugars.\nAnd to make sure that you\nnot only seek those out,\nbut you know where those foods are\nand that you ingest more\nand more and more of them.\nAnd there are two main ways\nthat these neural circuits work.\nIn fact, we can see that\nthere are two neural circuits\nentirely that work in parallel.\nAnd this is a common theme\nthroughout the nervous system,\nand that's parallel pathways.\nParallel pathways are the\nways that you can distinguish\nlight from dark,\nparallel pathways are\nthe ways that you can\ndistinguish high pitched\nsounds from low pitched sounds,\nparallel pathways are the ways\nthat you can flex your muscles\nversus extend your muscles.\nFor instance,\nif you move your wrist\ncloser to your shoulder,\nyou're flexing your bicep and\nyou're actually inhibiting,\nyou're actually preventing\nthe action of your tricep.\nIf you move your wrist\naway from your shoulder,\nyou are essentially using\nyour extensor, your tricep,\nand you're inhibiting the\nactivity of your bicep.\nSo for every function in your body\nthat you might think is\ncontrolled by one brain area\nor one neural circuit,\nalmost always there are\ntwo or more so called\nparallel pathways that ensure\nthat that particular behavior happens.\nNow, in the case of sugar consumption,\nthe two parallel pathways\ninvolve one pathway\nrelated to the actual taste\nand the perception of taste\nthat lead, not just you,\nbut every animal that we're aware of,\nto seek more sweet containing foods.\nThe other parallel pathway\nis related to the nutritive\ncomponent of sweet foods.\nMeaning the degree to which a given food\nwill raise blood glucose.\nI want to repeat that.\nOne pathway in your brain\nand body is devoted to\ngetting you to seek out\nsweet tasting things\nthat you perceive as sweet,\nand another parallel pathway is devoted\nto getting you to seek out foods\nthat lead to increases in blood glucose.\nIt just so happens that the foods\nthat lead to big\nincreases in blood glucose\ntypically are associated\nwith that sweet taste.\nNow, this is distinctly different\nthan the neural pathways\nthat control seeking\nof savory foods or salty\nfoods or spicy foods,\nfor that matter, or bitter foods.\nThe sweet pathway is what\nwe would call hardwired.\nIt exists, as far as we\nknow, in every mammal,\nit even exists in fruit\nflies, hence fruit fly.\nBasically getting sweet\nstuff into the body\nmight seem like it has a\nlot to do with the taste,\nbut it has just as much to do\nwith the nutritive components\nthat sweet tasting foods carry,\nand the fact that your nervous system\nand so many cells in your\nbrain and body run on glucose.\nIf you recall earlier, I said,\neven if you ingest fructose,\nfructose can be converted\ninto glucose in the liver.\nAnd I mentioned, of course,\nthat fructose may actually\nwork directly on the brain,\nthat's still unclear for humans,\nthe jury's still out on that, we will see.\nBut the fundamental\nthing to understand here\nis that when you think you\nwant a piece of chocolate\nor you think you want a piece of cake\nor you're craving something sweet,\nyou are both craving the taste\nand your neurons are literally craving\nthe nutritive components\nthat arrive with that taste.\nAnd simply by understanding that\ncan allow you to circumvent\nsome of the sugar cravings\nthat you might otherwise be a\ncomplete hopeless victim to.\nAlso in this episode,\nI will talk about ways\nthat you can sort of undermine\nor short circuit these\ncircuits, if you will,\nin order to reduce sugar\ncravings on a regular basis,\nif that's your goal.\nTwo parallel pathways,\none of the parallel pathways\nhas to do with conscious perception.\nSo animals of all kinds\nof mice, rats and humans,\nwill prefer sugary taste\nto non-sugary taste.\nWhen we eat something that tastes sweet,\nwe register that sweet taste\nby way of sweet receptors,\nliterally little ports\nor portals of neurons\non our tongue and on our pallet,\na lot of people don't realize this,\nbut there are a lot of taste\nreceptors on the soft pallet\nand around the mouth, on\nthe sides of the mouth.\nSo you're actually tasting things,\nnot just with your tongue,\nbut with your entire mouth\nand your pallet.\nSo when you ingest something sweet,\nvery quickly there are signals\nsent from those neurons\nin your mouth to brain areas\nthat cause you to seek out\nor at least pay attention to,\nthe source and the abundance\nof those sweet things.\nThey literally change your perception.\nIn fact, there are beautiful\nneuroimaging studies\nthat show that when people\ningest a sugary drink,\ntheir perception of images\nof foods change very much\nto make those foods\nappear more appetizing,\nand not just foods that contain sugar.\nResults of those studies do show\nthat there's an increase for instance,\nin the perception of detail\nand images of ice cream,\nafter you ingest a sweet drink\nor even if you put like a\nhard candy into your mouth,\nit will make you seek\nout sugary things more,\nit will make sugary things\nlook more appetizing,\nbut also other foods, more appetizing.\nSo I think it's important that\npeople recognize that fact,\nthat when you have a\nsweet taste in your mouth\nor when you've tasted something\nsweet within your mouth,\nI should say, your perception\nof has immediately shifted.\nThese are fast neural pathways.\nWe'll get into some of the\nbrain structures in a moment,\nbut these are fast neural pathways\nthat shift your entire self\ntoward seeking more sugary stuff\nand more food generally.\nNow, does that mean that\nyou should never ingest\nanything sweet?\nNo, certainly I'm not saying that,\neveryone has to decide for themselves\nwhat the appropriate\namount of sugar intake is,\nbut I find it remarkable when people say,\noh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix,\nor I need to have my chocolate,\nor I need to have a\nlittle bit of something\nto just kind of take care\nof that sugar appetite.\nBecause in taking care\nof that sugar appetite,\nmaybe for the very disciplined of you,\nyou can just have that\none piece of chocolate\nand it's great, and you can relish in it,\nbut it does shift the\nway that you perceive\nother foods as well.\nAnd the way it does that is through our,\nprobably if you're listener\nthis podcast, now old friend,\nbut incredible neuro modulator, dopamine.\nDopamine is a molecule\nthat is released from\nseveral places in the brain.\nThere's a so-called\nmesolimbic reward pathway,\nwhich is a whole set of places\nin the brain or circuits,\ndesigned to get us motivated and craving\nand in pursuit of things.\nAnd then of course there\nare areas of the brain\nthat are involved in movement\nthat are linked up with those\nareas involved in motivation.\nThat makes perfect sense.\nWhy would you have a brain\narea involved in motivation\nif you couldn't actually do\nsomething with that motivation?\nSo the way that your brain is designed\nis when there's an increase in dopamine,\nin the mesolimbic reward pathway,\nthere are signals sent\nto an area of the brain\ncalled the striatum,\nwe're going to spend a\nlittle bit of time today\nin the striatum.\nIt's got a dorsal part,\nmeaning in an upper part\nand a ventral part,\nwhich means a lower part.\nAnd the dopamine sent to those area,\nplaces us, excuse me,\ninto modes of action,\nto pursue particular things.\nSugar or sweet tastes, I should\nsay, to be more specific,\nhave an incredibly potent ability\nto activate dopamine release\nwithin the mesolimbic reward pathway.\nThis has been shown over\nand over and over again\nin animal models and in humans.\nThis is especially true, I should mention,\nthrough the ingestion of sweet liquids.\nNow this becomes a very\nimportant point to us\na little later on when we\ntalk about the proliferation\nof sodas and sweet drinks,\nand dare I even say,\nnon-sugar or diet sodas,\nwe're going to get into\nthat a little bit later.\nThey are perhaps one of\nthe most third rail topics\nin nutrition.\nBut when we ingest something sweet,\nthe perception of that sweet taste\nincreases dopamine in the\nmesolimbic reward pathways,\nwhich then are conveyed to\npathways for motor behavior,\nand in general, place us\ninto modes of focused action\ntoward getting more of whatever was sweet.\nAgain, for those of you\nthat are very disciplined,\nyou can probably eat that\none piece of chocolate\nand be just fine.\nBut if you understand the\nway that dopamine works,\nwhat you'll realize is that\nwhen this dopamine pathway\nis triggered,\nit tends to create not the\nsensation or the perception\nof satiety, of feeling\nlike something is enough,\nbut rather to produce the\nsensation of wanting more.\nAs described in the episode that I hosted\nwith my phenomenal colleague\nfrom Stanford School of\nMedicine, Dr. Anna Lembke,\nshe's an expert on addiction\nand dopamine pathways,\nthe dopamine circuits of the brain\nhave what we call a pleasure pain balance.\nAnd there I'm paraphrasing\nwhat Dr. Anna Lembke has said,\nand has written about\nin her beautiful book,\n\"Dopamine Nation.\"\nIf you haven't read that\nbook, I highly recommend it.\nWhether or not you have\nissues with addiction\nor you know people that do, or you don't,\nit's an incredibly important read,\nespecially if you're\ninterested in understanding\nmotivated behaviors and ways\nto channel your behaviors\nin life toward healthy,\nmotivated behaviors,\nand make sure that you avoid\nsome of the common pitfalls\nthat people fall into, not just addiction,\nbut things like overuse of social media\nor wasting time in general,\nit's a phenomenal book.\nIn that book, and of course,\nwithin research articles,\nyou will find evidence of this so-called\npleasure pain balance that exists\nwithin our dopamine circuits.\nNobody has dopamine\ncircuits that allow them\nto escape this pleasure pain balance.\nAnd the way this works is that anytime\nthat we engage in a behavior\nor we ingest something\nthat increases our levels of dopamine,\nthere is a subsequent increase\nin the neural circuits\nthat control our sense of\nfrustration, pain, and lack.\nYou can actually notice this phenomenon\nif, for instance,\nyou're somebody who\nreally likes chocolate,\nor you really like something else,\npay attention to the\nway that you experience\nindulging in that thing.\nIf you eat that piece of chocolate\nand you really focus on\nsavoring its amazing taste,\nyou'll notice that it provides\nsome quenching of your desire\nfor let's say sweet stuff\nor chocolate or both,\nbut right as you stop experiencing that,\nright as that chocolate intake tapers off,\nas you swallow it down your throat,\nor you just pause for a second afterwards,\nwhat you'll notice is\nthat your brain and body\nactually orient toward wanting more.\nAnd that wanting of more\nis really the action\nof the neural circuits that underlie pain\nand are pushing your\ndopamine levels back down.\nAnd when these circuits\ngo awry or I should say,\nwhen people fail to who control themselves\nwithin the context of that\npleasure pain balance,\nthe typical behavior is to\nreach for yet another chocolate\nor to then look for something\nthat will quench that desire\nand get dopamine levels back up.\nNow the way these pleasure\npain circuits work\nis very diabolical.\nBecause it turns out that were you to take\nanother piece of chocolate,\nyes, your dopamine\nlevels would go back up,\nbut not to the same extent that they did\nthe first bite of chocolate that you had.\nIn fact, we can say that\nthe longer it's been\nsince you've indulged in\nsomething that you really enjoy\nor would like,\nthe greater the dopamine\nyou will experience\nwhen you finally engage in that behavior\nor indulge to that\nthing, ingest that thing,\nand the greater the dopamine increase,\nthe greater the subsequent\naction of those pain circuits.\nSo this puts you on a\nvery complicated seesaw.\nIt's a very wobbly\nprecarious state to be in.\nWhich is not to say you shouldn't\nhave a piece of chocolate,\nit's just to say that the\nsweet taste of sweet things\nin particular, things\nthat we crave very much\nand we wait and wait and wait,\nand then we allow ourselves to indulge.\nThose trigger changes\nin our neurochemistry,\nin our neuro circuits,\nthat place us in a very vulnerable place,\nto either want more and more of that thing\nor to seek out other ways to\nfill that kind of emptiness\nthat we feel or that gap,\nlike, oh, I would love more,\nbut I'm not going to allow myself more.\nNow again, I'm not saying\nthat you shouldn't pursue\npleasurable things.\nI mean this molecule\ndopamine exists for a reason.\nFrankly, because of its involvement\nin sex and reproduction,\nit's the reason we're all\nhere in the first place.\nBecause last time I checked,\nthe only way any of us got\nhere was one way or another,\nsperm met egg and there was conception.\nI still believe there are\nno exceptions to that,\nthat I'm aware of anyways,\nthat is a process, or I should say,\nthe events leading up to that process\ntypically involve dopamine\nin one way or another.\nThere are exceptions to that\ntoo, but you get the idea.\nThese dopamine pathways are\nnot evil, they're not bad,\nbut once you understand the way they work,\nyou can leverage them to your advantage\nas opposed to them leveraging\nyou to their advantage.\nSo when you ingest something sweet,\nyou perceive that sweet\ntaste and a cascade ensues\nwithin your brain that makes you want more\nof the sweet thing.\nThat's the conscious pathway\nfor sugar perception,\nfor sweet perception.\nNow there's the second pathway,\nthe second pathway is what's called\nthe post-ingestive reinforcing\nproperties of sugar,\nwhich is really just a fancy\nnerd speak way of saying\nthere are events that\nhappen within your stomach\nand below your conscious detection,\nthat are also driving you to\nseek out sweet tasting things,\nindependent of their taste,\nand foods that increase blood glucose,\nindependent of their taste.\nIn order to illustrate the immense power\nof these subconscious\ncircuits for sugar seeking,\nI'd like to describe an experiment.\nAnd this is just one experiment of many,\nof dozens or more experiments\ndone in animal models\nand humans, which essentially\nillustrate the same thing.\nAnd as I describe this experiment,\nI think you will come to understand\nthe power of these circuits.\nI'll provide a link to\nthis study in the caption.\nThe first author is Freeman.\nThe paper was published in\nFrontiers in Bioscience,\nbut there have been others,\npapers in Nature Neuroscience,\npapers in Neuron,\nCell Press journals, et cetera,\nmany, many journals, many, many papers.\nIf subjects are given the\nchoice of drinking plain water\nor a sweet tasting fluid,\ntheir preference for\nthe sweet tasting fluid\nis much, much higher, right?\nSweet tastes better than plain water,\nat least for most people\nand certainly for animals.\nNow, if, for instance,\nyou take an animal which\ncompletely lacks sweet receptors,\nand you can do this through\nsome molecular genetic tools\nand gymnastics in the laboratory,\nwe call these knockout mice,\nwhere you can knock out\na particular receptor\nfor sweet taste,\nyou can confirm that there's\nno perception of sweet things\nor at least no preference for sweet things\nin those animals.\nIn humans, you can numb the mouth,\nthere are other pharmacologic ways\nthat you can eliminate sweet\nreceptors in the mouth.\nAnd by doing that, you\npeople will tell you,\nno, I can't taste anything sweet.\nYou could give them a ice cream,\nyou could give them pure sucrose,\nyou could give them table sugar,\nand they wouldn't be able\nto perceive it as sweet.\nIf you eliminate the perception\nof sweet taste in the mouth\nand you offer people\nor laboratory animals,\nwater versus some sugar\ncontaining solution,\nyou eliminate the preference\nfor the sugary solution.\nWhich tells us that\nthe perception of sweet\nis important for the preference\nfor sweet tasting drink.\nThis is also true for sweet\ntasting foods, I should mention.\nHowever, in both animal\nmodels and in humans,\nafter about 15 minutes,\nsubjects start preferring\nthe sugary water,\neven though they can't\ntaste that it is sweeter.\nSo to repeat that,\nif you eliminate the\nability to sense sweet,\nto perceive sweetness in foods,\nthen you eliminate the preference\nfor sweet beverages or sweet foods.\nSo that's not surprising.\nBut if you wait about 15 minutes,\nthe preference for the sweet beverage\nor the sweet food comes back.\nNow that doesn't mean that they\ncan perceive the sweetness.\nIn fact, the way these experiments\nare done is very clever.\nYou offer people various\ncups of different things\nor different food items.\nAnd then you just look\nat what they eat more of\nor what they prefer to eat more of.\nSo this experiment is so crucial\nbecause what it says\nis that the preference\nfor sugar containing foods is in part\ndue to the sweetness of those foods,\nbut in part due to something else.\nAnd this something else is what we call\nthe post-ingestive effect,\nand as I mentioned before,\nit took about 15 minutes.\nAnd you've actually experienced this,\nwhether you realize it or not,\nthis phenomenon of post-ingestive\nrewarding properties\nof sweet foods,\nmeaning what happens in your body\nwhen you ingest something that increases\nyour blood glucose very much,\nhas no doubt controlled\nyou from the inside,\nbelow your awareness,\nthis was happening to you\nand you didn't realize it.\nAnd here's how it works.\nWe all have neurons within our gut.\nThese neurons have a name,\nthey're called neuropod cells.\nNeuropod cells were famously discovered\nby Professor, Dr. Diego\nBohorquez at Duke University.\nAnd these cells respond\nto, among other things,\nto the presence of sugar within the gut.\nSo when we ingest a sugary food or drink,\nor we ingest a food or\ndrink that simply contains\nfructose, sucrose, glucose,\nor some other form of sugar\nthat later, through metabolism,\nwill be converted into glucose,\nthe neuropod cells are able to register\nthe presence of those sweet\nor glucose stimulating foods.\nAnd in response to that,\nsend electrical signals,\nbecause electrical signals are\nthe way neurons communicate,\nup to the brain, via the\nso-called vagus nerve.\nThe vagus nerve, of course,\nbeing a nerve pathway,\nfamous for its role in relaxation.\nThat's kind of the assumption out there,\nthat it's always involved in relaxation,\nthat's not the case.\nIt's involved in a lot of\nthings besides relaxation.\nBut nonetheless,\nthese neuropod cells\nsend electrical signals\nthrough a particular\nhighway within the vagus\nto the so-called nodose\nganglion, and this is a cluster,\na ganglion is just a cluster of neurons.\nAnd then the nodose ganglion\nsends on information\nto the nucleus of the solitary tract.\nThe nucleus of the solitary\ntract is an area of the brain\nthat we're going to talk\nabout extensively today.\nIt's very important for\nunderstanding sugar preference.\nThese neuropod cells\nalso trigger activation\nof dopamine pathways within\nthe mesolimbic reward pathway.\nIn other words, there are\nsignals conveyed from the gut,\nmeaning stomach and\nintestines, to the brain\nanytime we ingest sweet foods,\nbut it has nothing to\ndo with our perception\nof them being sweet, it has\neverything to do with the fact\nthat sweetness of food is\nalmost always correlated\nwith an ability to increase blood glucose.\nAnd the net effect of\nthis is a parallel pathway\nby which dopamine is increased further.\nNow, the experiment\nthat I described before\nof animals or humans ingesting something\nthat contains sugar,\nbut not being able to\nperceive its sweetness,\nand yet, after a period of time,\nstill preferring that food or drink\nto non-sugar containing food or drinks,\neven though they can't\ndistinguish their taste,\nis dependent on these neuropod\ncells and related pathways.\nWhat this may for you is that anytime\nyou eat something sweet,\nthat substance is\nactually causing your gut,\nyour stomach and your intestine,\nor to be more precise,\nI should say, that\nsubstance, food substance,\nis causing the neuropod cells\nin your stomach and intestines\nto send a parallel set of\nsignals up to your brain saying,\neat more of that, or simply\neat more, eat more, eat more,\nand preferably eat more sweet foods.\nSo we've all heard of hidden sugars,\nmeaning the sugars that\nmanufacturers have put into foods\nand disguised them with other flavors.\nI talked about this in\nthe episode on salt,\nusing salt to mask the taste of sweetness\nso that people ingest more sugar.\nThat is not an accident\nthat hidden sugars are\noften hidden with salt\nor with other flavors.\nIt's done so that people\nwill, meaning you or me,\nwill want to ingest more\nof a particular food,\nindependent of how sweet that food tastes.\nAnd in fact, some crackers, for instance,\nchips for instance, you might\nthink, oh, well, you know,\nchips, they're not sweet,\nthey're salty and savory.\nAnd again, I'll mention, I\nlove salty and savory foods,\nincluding certain foods, I love\nkettle chips, for instance,\nI try not to walk by them\nin the grocery store.\nI usually have to eat one\nbag while I'm in the store,\nand then another later.\nThe savory foods are often\nladen with these hidden sugars\nthat we can't register as sweetness,\nbut trigger the neuropod cells,\nwhich then further trigger dopamine,\nwhich make us want more of them.\nNow we may be able to\nresist eating more of them,\nbut it makes us crave\nmore food in general.\nNow we will talk about ways\nto regulate this pathway,\nto sort of intervene in\nthis subconscious pathway.\nBut for now I'm hoping\nthat just the understanding\nthat we all have this pathway,\nthis is hardwired into our body,\ncould potentially allow\npeople to better understand\nwhy is it that their\ncravings are so intense,\nthat it's not necessarily just\nabout the taste of that food.\nAnd when you consider this\nin concert with the fact\nthat we have this dopamine pain\npleasure balance, excuse me,\nthat I referred to earlier,\nyou start to realize that\nthere are multiple mechanisms\nhardwired into us, that make\nit especially hard to not eat\nthe sweet thing or to not eat\nthe food that we're craving.\nAnd indeed, that's the case.\nWe have two major accelerators.\nIt's like a car with two accelerators,\nand we will talk about the brakes,\nbut two ways that really\nget us into forward motion\ntoward pursuing the\nconsumption of sweet foods.\nNow, if it doesn't already\nseem diabolical enough,\nthat sweet things that\nwe perceive as sweet,\nmake us want to eat more of those\nbecause of dopamine and then send us down\nthis pain pleasure pathway\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nand the fact that we have\nthis subconscious circuit\ncoming from the neuropod cells in our gut\nthat are registering the presence of sugar\nor glucose increasing foods in our gut\nand sending those signals to\nthe brain for yet more dopamine\nand pain pleasure challenges,\nthere's a third layer to this whole thing.\nAnd that has to do with how sugar\nis metabolized in the brain.\nOr I should say how glucose is used.\nWithout getting into too much detail,\nsome of the more beautiful\nstudies of neuroimaging\nand evaluating which\nbrain areas are active\nwhen we eat certain foods\nwere done by Dr. Dana Small's\nlab at Yale University,\nand in some of her previous\nwork when she was elsewhere,\nand of course by other laboratories too.\nAnd they used an approach called\npositron emission tomography,\nand they and others have used\nPET scanning as it's called,\npositron mission tomography,\nalong with an tool\ncalled 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.\n2-Deoxy-D-glucose is actually\ninvolved in the procedure\nof seeing which brain areas are active\nwhen people eat foods or engage\nin other types of behaviors.\nBut the way that 2-Deoxy-D-glucose,\nsometimes shortened 2DG.\nThe way that it works is\nto block glucose uptake\nfrom neurons.\nAnd instead, bring along with it,\na marker that one can see through imaging.\nSo in other words,\na tool for looking at what\nparts of the brain are active\nwhen eating particular foods,\nactually prevents foods such as sugar,\nfrom allowing glucose to\nget into particular neurons.\nNow that might seem like a bad situation,\nyou'd say, well, wait,\nyou're trying to understand\nhow sugar works in the brain,\nand then you block the\nability for sugar, glucose,\nto bind to, or be used by these neurons,\nbecause of the thing that\nyou're using for the experiment.\nExactly, it's a huge problem,\nbut it turns out to be a huge problem\nthat led to a great insight.\nAnd the great insight is this,\nthe preference for sweet\ntasting foods and liquids\nis actually blocked by 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.\nWhat that means, experimentally,\nbut also in terms of what\nit means for you and me\nin the real world, is that there's yet\na third parallel pathway\nthat's related to the use of blood sugar,\nthe use of glucose by neurons,\nthat further reinforces our\ndesire to eat more sweet things.\nAnd the preference for sweet foods\ncan actually be eliminated\nthrough 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.\nNow I am definitely don't\nwant people going out\nand consuming 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.\nThis is a laboratory tool,\nit is not something that\nyou should be ingesting.\nSo don't go look it up\nand try and get some,\nthere might be other uses for\nit, but that's not the point.\nThe point is that it is the\nsweet taste of sugary foods.\nIt is the signals coming from your gut,\nfrom your digestive tract to your brain,\nand it's the use of the\nmetabolic consequences\nof sugary foods that are\nacting as a three pronged push\non your desire to consume\nmore sugary foods.\nSo this car analogy that I used before,\nwhere it's some weird car\nthat has two accelerators,\nit actually has three accelerators.\nAnd so with three accelerators,\nall pushing the system hard,\nwe can say, wow,\nthere must be something really\nspecial about this pathway.\nAnd indeed there is,\nthis pathway is the quickest\nsource of fuel for the brain\nand the rest of the nervous system,\nit's the source of fuel for\nthe brain and nervous system.\nAnd I realize, as I say\nthat all the ketonistas\nare probably going no,\nactually ketones are the preferred source.\nOkay, i acknowledge that\nthere are conditions\nunder which you can bring\nyour blood glucose very low,\nand there are reasons to do that.\nActually ketosis has been a\nterrifically successful treatment\nfor a lot of forms of epilepsy,\nin particular, pediatric epilepsy.\nMany people do derive\nbenefit from ketogenic diets,\nso I'm not knocking ketogenic diets,\nbut if you were to look at\nwhat neurons normally prefer,\nmeaning in a typical diet\nregimen, it would be glucose.\nAnd the fact that fructose\nis eventually converted to glucose,\nthe fact that when we ingest sucrose,\nit's eventually converted into\na fuel that neurons can use,\nthat's very much in the glucose pathway,\nwhat you basically arrive at is the fact\nthat your nervous system is\na glucose consuming machine.\nAnd you've got at least three pathways,\nof which I've described,\nthat are pushing on your brain consciously\nand subconsciously to get\nyou to seek and consume\nmore sugar.\nNow that all sounds like a\npretty depressing picture,\nat least for those of you\nthat are trying to reduce\nyour sugar intake.\nAnd of course we can\nall reduce sugar intake\nby way of sheer will,\nwe can not have those foods at home,\nwe can restrict ourselves from those.\nBut there are some things that we all can\nand perhaps should do in order\nto regulate these pathways\nsuch that we don't feel\nso controlled by them,\nbut rather that we control their output.\nAnd of course they are us and we are them,\nso this gets into all sorts\nof issues of consciousness\nand freewill that I\ncertainly don't want to cover\nin this episode.\nBut nonetheless, I think\nonce you understand\nthat these circuits exist\nand you understand that there\nare simple substitutions\nand modifications that one\ncan make to their food intake\nthat can work within these pathways\nand even bypass some of these pathways,\nyou start to realize that\nyou have a lot more control\nover sugar intake and sugar appetite\nthan you previously thought.\nNow, many of you have heard of\nthe so-called glycemic index.\nThe glycemic index is a measure of\nhow quickly blood sugar rises\nafter ingesting particular foods.\nAnd very broadly speaking,\nwe can say that there are\nlow glycemic index foods,\nof less than 55, typically,\nis the measurement,\nor medium glycemic index foods,\nwhich go from about 55 to 69,\nand then so called high glycemic\nfoods, which are above 70.\nAnd of course there's additional nuance\nrelated to glycemic load\nand many more features\nof the glycemic index.\nA couple of things to understand\nabout how the glycemic index is measured.\nAnd then I'd like to\njust briefly talk about\nhow the glycemic index can\nbe leveraged to short circuit\nsome of the neural circuits\nthat would otherwise lead us\nto crave and perhaps\neven ingest sugar foods.\nFirst of all, measurements\nof glycemic indices of food\nare typically made by having\npeople ingest those foods\nin isolation.\nAnd in general, we can say\nthat anytime we ingest fiber\nand/or fat, lipids, along\nwith a particular food,\nit will reduce the glycemic\nindex of that particular food,\neither the absolute level of blood glucose\nthat a particular food causes\nor the rate at which that\nelevation in blood glucose occurs.\nAnd this is why there are some\nseemingly paradoxical aspects\nto sweet stuff in terms\nof the glycemic index.\nFor instance, Ice cream\nhas a lower glycemic index,\nprovided its ice cream that includes fat,\nwhich I hope it would,\n'cause that's the good tasting ice cream,\nin my opinion,\ncompared to something like\nmangoes or table sugar, right?\nSo the glycemic index is\nnot something to hold holy,\nin most cases,\nbecause most people are not\ningesting foods in isolation.\nAnd there's actually a lot of argument\nas to whether or not the glycemic index\nis really as vital as some people claim.\nThere's also the context\nin which you ingest particular foods.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nafter I do hard training of any kind,\nmeaning training that\nought to deplete glycogen,\nso hard resistance training,\nI actually make it a point to ingest\nsome very sweet high\nglycemic foods like a mango,\nI'll also ingest some starches\n'cause I'm trying to replenish glycogen.\nI'm also trying to spike\nmy blood sugar a little bit\nbecause that can be advantageous\nin terms of certain strength\nand hypertrophy protocols,\net cetera.\nBut most of the time I'm avoiding\nthese high glycemic foods\nand high sugar foods, I\nshould point that out.\nNow, why am I telling you\nabout the glycemic index?\nWell, if we zoom out\nand take our perspective\non all of this discussion\nabout the glycemic index,\nthrough the lens of the nervous system,\nand we remind ourselves that neurons\nprefer glucose for energy\nand that all sweet things,\nor things that we perceive as sweet,\nbut also sweet things that\nare ingested and registered\nby those neuropod cells in our gut\ntrigger the release of dopamine\nand trigger these neural circuits\nto make us want to eat\nmore of these foods,\nwhat we start to realize\nis that a sharp rise\nin blood glucose or a very\nhigh degree of elevation\nin blood glucose,\nis going to be a much more potent signal\nthan would a more moderate\nrise in blood glucose\nor a slower rise in blood glucose.\nSo if we think about the\nanalogy of three accelerators,\nmeaning three parallel neural circuits,\nall essentially there\nto get us to seek out\nand consume more sweet\ntasting and sugary foods,\nwell then the glycemic index\nis sort of our measurement\nof how hard we are pushing down\nor how fast we are pushing down\non those three accelerators.\nAnd so for those of you that are trying to\nreduce sugar take,\nand you want to do that\nthrough an understanding\nof how these neural circuits work,\nand you want to short circuit\nsome of the dopamine release\nthat's caused by ingesting sugary foods.\nIt can be advantageous\nto ingest sweet foods,\neither alone or in combination with foods\nthat reduce glycemic index\nor reduce glycemic load.\nSo that might mean making\ndifferent food choices.\nSo paying attention to sweet tasting foods\nthat can satisfy sugar cravings,\nbut do not have as steep or I should say,\ndo not cause as steep\na rise in blood sugar,\nor it could mean consuming other foods\nalong with sweet foods\nin order to reduce the glycemic index\nand thereby, slow or blunt\nthe release of dopamine.\nYou might think, well, why\nwould I want to do that?\nI want the maximum dopamine output\nin response to a given sweet food.\nI don't just want the you know, level 10.\nI want the level 100 output of dopamine.\nBut you really don't,\nbecause of the pleasure pain\nbalance that dopamine causes.\nAnd in fact, if we consider\nsome of the non-food substances\nthat really push hard on\nthese dopamine pathways,\nwe can come up with a somewhat sinister,\nbut nonetheless appropriate analogy.\nThe drug, cocaine, causes\nvery robust, potent increases\nin dopamine within the brain,\nand typically causes people\nto want to ingest more cocaine\nbecause of those sharp\nincreases in dopamine.\nBut within the category\nof the drug cocaine,\nthere are various modes of ingestion.\nSome people inhale it,\nsome people will inject it intravenously,\nsome people will smoke it,\nand those different\nforms of taking cocaine\nactually impact the dopamine\ncircuits differently.\nAnd it turns out that crack cocaine,\nthe smokable form of cocaine rock,\nincreases dopamine to a very high degree,\nbut also very quickly.\nAnd it is the sharp rise\nin dopamine over time,\nnot so much the absolute\nlevel of dopamine,\nthat makes crack cocaine\nso absolutely addictive.\nSo sometimes you'll hear, you know,\nsugar is like crack,\nwell, and that's getting a little extreme\nbecause even though I don't\nthink the measurements\nhave been done in the same experiment,\nI think it's reasonable to think\nthat the absolute level of dopamine caused\nby ingesting sugar, at\nleast for most people,\nis not going to be as high as\nthe absolute level of dopamine\ncaused by smoking crack.\nOf course it goes without saying,\nplease don't do cocaine\nin any form, by the way.\nIt is appropriate to say that\nthe rate of dopamine increase\nover time has a profound\neffect on how people will,\nand if people will,\ngo on to want to pursue\nmore of what caused\nthat increase in dopamine.\nSo what I'm basically saying\nis if you're going to ingest\nsweet foods in order to\nsatisfy a sweet craving,\ningesting sweet foods for which\nthe glycemic index is lower\nor in which you've adjusted\nthose glycemic index foods\nthrough the co-ingestion\nof fiber, or maybe fat,\nmight be beneficial.\nSo is this justification\nfor putting peanut butter\non that piece of chocolate\nor for having a of ice\ncream along with the mango\nthat you're craving?\nIn some sense, yes, however,\nthere's also the issue of\nhow sweet and how delicious\nsomething tastes.\nHighly palatable foods,\nabsolutely delicious foods,\ntrigger that one neural circuit,\nthat one accelerator that\nwe were talking about\nin terms of our analogy\nof three accelerators,\nand the more delicious something\ntastes within our mouth,\nthe further increase in dopamine.\nSo if you really wanted to\nadjust your sugar cravings\nand you really still want\nto ingest some sugary foods,\nyou probably would better\noff combining fiber\nwith that sugary or sweet food.\nNow I do realize that\nit's somewhat unusual\nand you probably get some strange stares,\nif you decided to consume broccoli,\nfor instance, along with your chocolate,\nor with a another dessert\nthat would otherwise\ncause a steep increase in blood sugar\nand has a high glycemic index.\nBut nonetheless, if your goal is to blunt\nyour sugar cravings,\nwhat you really need to do is\nblunt that dopamine increase.\nSo what we're really talking about here\nis trying to reduce the dopamine signal\nthat is the consequence\nof ingesting sweet foods.\nAnd we're talking about doing that\nthrough these different parallel pathways,\nnot just by preventing sweet taste,\nbut also by preventing\nthe post-ingestive effects\nof sweet foods.\nAnd of course the backdrop to all of this\nis that most of us, again,\nmost of us, not all of us,\nshould probably be ingesting\nfewer refined sugars.\nCertainly there are exceptions to that.\nBut I think the bulk of\ndata point to the fact\nthat ingesting these highly palatable,\ncertainly highly palatable,\nhighly processed foods,\nor foods that contain a lot\nof high fructose corn syrup,\ncan be really deleterious to our health,\nespecially in kids.\nAnd I'm not going to cite\noff a bunch of statistics,\nyou've all heard them before,\nthat you know, for hundreds of\nyears, we ingested, you know,\nthe equivalent of a few cups\nor pounds of sugar per year.\nAnd you know, now people are ingesting\nhundreds of pounds of sugar per year.\nThe major culprit always\nseems to be sugary drinks,\nmeaning soft drinks, and I\nthink indeed that's the case.\nI do want to point out the incredible work\nof Dr. Robert Lustig,\nwho's a pediatric endocrinologist\nat the University of\nCalifornia San Francisco,\nwho was really early in the\ngame of voicing the dangers\nof so-called hidden sugars\nand highly processed foods,\nthere are other people, of\ncourse, now talking about this.\nHis laboratory has done important\nwork showing for instance,\nthat if high fructose corn syrup\nor even just fructose is\nreplaced with glucose,\neven if the same number\ncalories is ingested,\nthat there are important\nmeaning significant reductions\nin type two diabetes,\nsome of the metabolic syndromes\nassociated with high fructose corn syrup\nand on and on and on.\nAnd of course there are other\nculprits in type two diabetes,\nthere are other factors that\nare going to lead to obesity.\nBut I think that work\nfrom Lustig and others\nhas really illustrated that\nwe should all be trying\nto reduce our intake of\nhighly refined sugars\nand high fructose corn syrup.\nAnd certainly trying to reduce our intake\nof very sugary drinks,\nnot just soft drinks,\nbut also fruit juices that\ncontain a lot of sugar.\nNow, even for people that\nare of healthy weight\nand who don't have metabolic syndromes,\nthere may be an additional reason\nto not want to ingest very sweet foods\nand highly refined sugars.\nAnd this has to do with\na new and emerging area\nof nutrition neuroscience.\nAnd I want to point out that\nthese are new data, right,\nso it's not a lock,\nthe double blind placebo\ncontrolled studies\nin large populations\nhave not been finished.\nSo I want to make sure that that's clear,\nbut I also want to make clear\nwhat some of the really exciting data,\ncoming from Dana Small's lab at Yale,\nand from other laboratories are showing.\nAnd this has to do with what's called\nconditioned taste preference.\nUsing a kind of Pavlovian\nparadigm, what they do,\nis they have people, and these\nstudies were done in people,\ningest maltodextrin, which\nincreases blood glucose,\ndoesn't have much flavor,\nbut even if it does have a\nlittle bit of subtle flavor,\nthe maltodextrin is cloaked\nby some other flavor.\nAnd by cloaking it with that other flavor\nor pairing it with that other flavor,\nwhat they find is that over time,\nbecause the maltodextrin\nincreases blood glucose,\nand they're ingesting a particular flavor\nalong with that maltodextrin,\nthey can then remove the maltodextrin,\nand the flavor will induce\nan increase in insulin.\nThe increase in insulin of course,\nis the consequence of\nthe fact that anytime\nthere's a rise in blood glucose,\nprovided the person isn't diabetic,\nthere's a parallel increase in insulin.\nNow this is very interesting\nbecause what it says is,\nwell at a first pass, it says\nthat we are very Pavlovian\nin terms of our physiological\nresponses to foods\nand particular flavors\ncome to be associated\nwith particular patterns\nof blood glucose increase\nand hence patterns of insulin increase,\nbecause of course,\ninsulin manages glucose in the bloodstream\nas I mentioned earlier.\nThis also has implications\nfor understanding\nthings like artificial sweeteners.\nAnd here I want to\nhighlight that this is still\nvery controversial work, needs\nmore data, but nonetheless,\nI'd like to share it with\nyou for consideration.\nThe small laboratory has\ndone studies in humans,\nboth in adults and in children,\nshowing that if the flavor\nof artificial sweeteners\nis paired with maltodextrin,\nand then the maltodextrin is removed,\nthat the artificial sweetener taste itself\ncan subsequently increase\ninsulin in the bloodstream.\nIn other words, taking something\nthat increases blood sugar,\nattaching a flavor experience to that,\nhaving children or\nadults ingest that thing,\nallows the nervous system\nto associate that flavor\nwith that increase in blood glucose.\nBut then you can remove the\nglucose increasing substance,\nand the flavor alone will increase insulin\nbecause insulin typically\nfollows blood glucose.\nSo this is a conditioning effect.\nNow, the reason these\ndata are controversial\nis several fold.\nFirst of all, the landscape\naround the discussion\naround artificial sweeteners\nis definitely what I would call\na barbed wire topic.\nAnd I want to preface what I'm\nabout to say next by saying,\nI actually ingest artificial sweeteners.\nI will have the occasional\ndiet soda, not every day,\nmaybe I don't know, once or twice a month.\nI don't particularly like the taste,\nbut I'll do it just 'cause it's around,\nand I want some caffeine\nand I like the carbonation\nif I'm on a plane or something,\nI do ingest plant-based\nnon-caloric sweeteners.\nTo my knowledge, there have\nnot been high quality studies\nof plant-based non-caloric sweeteners\nin the context that I'm referring to here.\nNonetheless, these studies\nshow that particular flavors\ncan be conditioned to\ncause an insulin increase.\nAnd the flavor associated with\ncertain artificial sweeteners\nis included in that category of flavors\nthat can induce insulin,\neven in the absence of something\nthat can increase blood glucose.\nNow the simple takeaway from these studies\nwould be the following,\nand this is actually one\ninterpretation that Dana Small\nhas offered to her data,\nbut she offers other\ninterpretations as well.\nOne of interpretation is that if people\nare going to ingest artificial sweeteners,\nand they do that along with foods\nthat very sharply increase blood glucose,\nthen there is the potential,\nI highlight the potential,\nfor those same artificial\nsweeteners to increase insulin,\neven in the absence of food.\nIn other words, let's\njust draw the scenario out\nin the real world.\nYou're having a diet soda\nalong with a cheeseburger and fries.\nYou do that every day for lunch, okay?\nSomewhat extreme example,\nbut natural world example,\nyou do that every day for lunch.\nAnd then you just have a diet soda alone.\nThe extreme interpretation of the data\nthat they've collected says,\nwell, that diet soda alone\nwill increase insulin,\neven though there's no\nincrease in blood glucose\nbecause you haven't ingested food with it\nbecause you conditioned that\ntaste of artificial sweetener\nto the experience of a rise\nin glucose and hence insulin.\nNow the counter argument to this would be,\nwell, that's a very unusual situation,\nmaltodextrin causes big\nincreases in blood glucose,\nso that's not really a fair experiment\nor it's not a natural world experiment.\nAnd I think that's a decent assessment.\nAlthough I will point out\nthat one of the reasons\nwhy this study is so controversial\nor why these data are so controversial,\nis that the experiment\nactually had to be stopped.\nAnd particularly the\nexperiment in children\nhad to be stopped because\nthe changes in insulin\nthat were observed early in\nthe study were so detrimental,\nthat the institutional review\nboard, quite appropriately,\nsaid, we can't do this to these kids.\nThey're experiencing these\nodd shifts in insulin\nthat are not healthy for them\nwhen they're just ingesting\nartificial sweeteners\nin the absence of these\nglucose increasing foods.\nSo once again, I do ingest\nartificial sweeteners,\nI'm not saying that they are dangerous,\nI'm not saying that\nthey are not dangerous,\nI'm saying that you have\nto decide for yourself.\nIn previous episodes,\nI've highlighted that\nartificial sweeteners\nhave been shown in studies of animals,\nthat when given in very high\ndoses, sucralose in particular,\nthere can be fairly robust\ndisruption to the gut microbiome,\nwhich is vital for immune\nhealth and brain health,\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut thus far, our knowledge\nof how artificial sweeteners\nnegatively impacts or positively\nimpacts, I should say,\nthe microbiome and other\ndeleterious effects on the body,\nhas mainly been explored\nin animal studies.\nAgain, the work by Dana Small\nhas been done in humans.\nThere's some parallel work\nby others in animal models.\nI bring it up today to\nillustrate the following point.\nNormally we have a pathway\nthat we don't have to condition at all,\nit's there from birth,\nwhereby ingestion of sweet foods\ncauses increases in dopamine.\nAnd there are parallel pathways\nby which neurons in our gut\nand elsewhere in our body,\ntrigger further increases in dopamine.\nThere's no need for a conditioned response\nor to become Pavlovian about this, right?\nYou're hardwired to want\nto eat sweet things,\nby at least two and probably\nthree parallel pathways.\nNow the work from Dana\nSmall's lab and others\nthat have illustrated this\nconditioned flavor preference,\nI think beautifully show that any flavor\nthat's associated with a glucose spike\nor a long sustained increase in glucose\ncan also be conditioned.\nIn other words, the circuits for dopamine\nthat reinforce the desire\nto eat particular things\nis not unique to the sugar pathway.\nAnd this is one of the reasons I believe,\nwhy ingestion of sweet foods\ndoesn't just us to want\nto eat more sweet foods,\nI think that is absolutely clear\nbased on animal data and on human data,\nI think that's robust,\nit's actually the stuff of textbooks now,\nbut in addition, ingesting sweet foods\nand/or foods that raise blood glucose,\nbut that we don't perceive as sweet.\nSo for instance, foods with hidden sugars,\nsugars that have been masked\nasked by salty or spicy taste,\nincreases our desire for\nglucose elevating foods\nand food, generally,\nI think that's the only\nlogical interpretation\nof the data that I can arrive at.\nSo for people that struggle\nwith regulating their appetite\nor with regulating their sugar appetite,\nI think the understanding of\nconditioned flavor preference,\nwhile a little bit complicated,\nought to be useful in\ntrying to navigate reducing\nsugar cravings and sugar intake.\nAs a segue into tools\nto control sugar intake,\nas a means to both regulate\nsugar intake itself,\nas well as food intake overall\nand steer us towards healthier choices.\nI'd like to talk about some\nof the special populations\nout there that might want\nto be especially wary\nof having a dysregulated\nsugar appetite system.\nAnd the group I'm\nreferring to specifically\nare those with attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder\nor, I should say, and/or,\npeople who have issues with\nfocus and attention, generally.\nAnd I think more and more nowadays,\nI'm hearing that people are\nhaving a hard time focusing.\nThis probably has something\nto do with our interactions\nwith electronic devices.\nAs I always say, if a picture\nis worth a thousand words,\na movie is worth a million pictures,\nand the fact that we\ncan access so any movies\njust by scrolling with our thumb,\nis something that the nervous system\nhas just never contended\nwith before in human history.\nI'm confident in that.\nAnd it's not that it can't deal with it,\nthe question is what's the trade off?\nWhat are the consequences of that?\nSo attention and ability\nto focus is obviously key\nto success in school,\nsuccess in relationships,\nsuccess in the workplace,\nand success in life.\nWe could probably even go so\nfar as to say one's ability\nto succeed in anything is\nproportional to one's ability\nto focus and then deliberately defocus\nwhen the time comes to defocus, right?\n'Cause we all need rest\nand we need to disengage\nand then reengage,\nIf you look at the sum\ntotal of the meta-analysis\nand the clinical data\non ADHD and nutrition,\nyou arrive at a pretty clear answer,\nwhich is that sugar consumption,\nin particular, highly refined sugars,\nis just not good for people with ADHD\nor with attentional issues.\nNow, as I say that, I\nalso want you to recall\nthe earlier study that I referred to,\nwhereby the tuning of neurons in the brain\nis highly dependent on glucose.\nSo this doesn't mean consuming no glucose\nis going to be a good idea.\nIt doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet\nis necessarily the best diet for ADHD.\nAlthough there are some\npeople pursuing that\nand exploring that, and we'll\ndo yet another episode on ADHD\nat some point that go was a\nlittle bit deeper into that,\nbecause there's some new data.\nI did do a very long and fairly\nextensive episode on ADHD.\nYou're welcome to look that\nup if you like in our archive,\nexcuse me, in our archive\nat hubermanlab.com,\nit's all timestamped.\nSo, you know, because the\nnumber of people said,\noh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD\nand you made it two and a half hours long.\nYes we did, because we wanted\nit to be as comprehensive\nas we could at the time.\nBut it is timestamped,\nyou can just jump to the\nparticular topics of interest\nand there's short little cassettes there.\nNow, if you'd like to\nknow upon what I'm basing\nthis statement that sugar consumption\nand highly refined sugar consumption\nis potentially bad for ADHD,\nI'm basing this mainly on the conclusions\nof a really nice paper,\nthe title of the paper is\n\"Sugar Consumption, Sugar\nSweetened Beverages,\nand Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder:\nA Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\"\nAnd this is a paper,\nwe'll put a link to this in the caption.\nThis was published in\nComplementary Therapies in Medicine\nwhich is a bit of an atypical\njournal in some sense.\nBut I really like this meta-analysis.\nThe sum total of this\nmeta-analysis is really that when,\nespecially kids, get beyond\nfour sugary drinks per week,\nso four sodas of a typical 12 ounce soda,\nwhen they get past four\n12 ounce sugary sodas,\nthey didn't, as far as I know,\nlook at artificially sweetened sodas.\nThat's when you start\nto see a shift towards\nmore negative outcomes, more\nsymptoms of existing ADHD.\nNow where the controversy comes in\nis whether or not sugar consumption\ncan actually trigger or cause ADHD.\nAnd I don't think we can conclude\nthat at all at this time.\nAnd this review, if you\ndecide to check it out,\nreview/meta-analysis, I should say,\nif you decide to check it out,\ngoes into some of the nuance around that.\nWhat's also interesting in\nterms of ADHD and sugar intake,\nand it probably has\nrelevance to all of us,\nis that they also cover\nsome of the interesting data\nshowing that supplementation\nwith omega-3 fatty acids\ncan actually beneficial for people,\nin particular kids with ADHD,\nI've talked before about\nthe utility of omega-3s,\nthat's been shown in various studies\nthat have compared\nomega-3 fatty acid intake\nto say prescription\nantidepressants, like SSRIs,\nlike Prozac, Zoloft,\nand similar, Fluoxetine,\nand the results of those\nstudies are pretty clear,\nat least to me,\nthat provided that one gets\nat least one gram of EPA,\nessential fatty acids,\nso it's not just getting one gram per day,\nbut one or more grams\nper day of the EPA form\nof essential fatty acid,\ncan rival some prescription\nantidepressants\nand/or decrease the\namount of antidepressants\nthat's required to take.\nWhich for a lot of people\ncan be a very useful thing\nbecause of the side effect profile\nof many of those antidepressants.\nOf course, talk to your\npsychiatrist, talk to your doctor,\nbut the omega-3s are no doubt powerful.\nAnd then of course there's a whole story\nabout omega-3s and heart health.\nAnd of course, like anything else,\nthere's some controversy around omega-3s,\nbut I think the data\nare clear enough to me\naround mood and cardiovascular health,\nthat certainly I personally ingest them.\nBut as always, I always say,\nanytime you're going to\nadd or remove anything\nfrom your nutrition,\nsupplementation, exercise,\nor otherwise your lifestyle,\ndefinitely consult with a\nboard certified physician.\nI don't just say that to protect me,\nI say that to protect you,\nyou are responsible for\nyour health ultimately.\nSo omega-3 supplementation\nhas been shown to be\nbeneficial for ADHD.\nWhy am I talking about this in the context\nof an episode on sugar\nand the nervous system?\nWell, if you remember\nthose neuropod cells,\nthose cells in your gut\nthat respond to sugar\nand send signals up to the brain\nto cause the release of dopamine.\nWell, it turns out that\nneuropod cells also respond to\namino acids and to fatty acids,\nin particular, essential fatty acids.\nSo these cells that we\ncall neuropod cells,\nhave three jobs.\nOne is to levels of sugar in the gut,\nthe other is to detect\nlevels of amino acids,\nand to detect levels of\nparticular essential fatty acids,\nand communicate that\ninformation to the brain.\nAnd I should point out\nwhen I say communicate\nthat information, they're\nnot actually saying,\nhey, there's amino acids here,\nor hey, there's sugar here,\nor, hey, there's essential fatty acids,\nbecause the language of these\ncells is somewhat generic.\nIt's just the firing of\nelectrical potentials.\nBut that's the key point,\nit's generic and all three\nor any of those three,\nsugar, essential fatty\nacids, or amino acids,\nwill trigger these neurons to signal\nto the brain to increase dopamine.\nAnd it is not coincidental\nthat omega-3 fatty acid\nsupplementation can help ameliorate\nsome of the symptoms of ADHD\nby way of presumably increasing dopamine\nin this neuropod to dopamine pathway\nthat we talked about earlier.\nThe whole thing has a very\nnice logical structure to it.\nAnd points to yet again,\nthe immense value of\nbringing the proper amounts,\nmaybe even supplementing\nthe proper amounts\nof omega-3 fatty acids and the\nproper amounts of amino acids\ninto the gut as a way to supplant\nsome of the stimulation of these pathways\nthat would otherwise be caused by sugar.\nThere's actually a version\nof this where one could say,\nif you want to reduce sugar cravings,\nyou might consider\nincreasing certain forms\nof amino acid intake or certain\nforms of fatty acid intake.\nSo what are some ways that we\ncan reduce our sugar cravings,\nand ideally ways that we can do that,\nthat also benefit us in other ways,\nboth nutritionally and from\nthe neuroscience standpoint?\nWell, these neuropod cells that respond to\nand signal the brain when we\ningest sugar, as I mentioned,\nalso respond to amino acids\nand essential fatty acids.\nWe already talked about\nthe essential fatty acids.\nI make it a particular\npoint to ingest anywhere\nfrom one to three grams, that's grams,\nof EPA essential fatty acid per day.\nI make it a point to do\nthat with the ingestion\nof high quality omega-3s.\nFor me, the simplest way to do that,\nand I think for most people,\nthe lowest cost way to do that,\nis to use some liquid form of fish oil\nor some capsule form of fish oil.\nYou really do have to see\nhow much essential fatty acid\nin the form of EPA is in those.\nIf you try and do that\nonly through capsules,\nit can get kind of expensive,\ndepending on which\nparticular brands you use,\nsome have more EPA, some less.\nYou can, of course also\ndo this through foods,\nyou can do this with non fish sources,\nthrough things like algae,\nand there's some other forms,\nyou can look it up online now,\nplant-based sources of EPAs,\nyou can do this with\nhigh quality fish oil.\nIn any case, that does\nseem at least based on\na modest amount, but\nnonetheless solid literature,\nto reduce sugar cravings somewhat,\nbut that could easily be by\nmere replacement of calories.\nSo we don't know yet\nbased on human studies,\nwhether or not the ingestion of those EPAs\nis specifically activating\nthe neuropod cells,\nwhich specifically\nactivates dopamine release\nand bypasses the need for,\nor the craving for sugar.\nWe don't know that yet.\nBut logically, it holds up to assume that.\nThe fact that these neuropod cells\nand I should say other\nneurons within the gut\nrespond very robustly to the presence\nof particular amino acids\nis also a potential lever\nby which one could reduce sugar cravings.\nAnd there's an interesting literature\naround the amino acid, glutamine,\nin particular supplementing\nwith the amino acid, glutamine,\nas it relates to sugar cravings,\nand certainly as it relates\nto other aspects of the gut,\nin particular leaky gut.\nThe use of supplemental glutamine\nto try and treat leaky gut\nis not a new phenomenon.\nThere are other approaches too, of course.\nBut there are many people\nwho are experimenting\nwith supplementing with\nglutamine, several grams per day,\noften even, you know, five\ngrams distributed through\nthree or four different\nservings throughout the day\nas a way to blunt their sugar cravings.\nNow there has not yet been\na large scale clinical trial\nusing glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,\nbut the results of the few\nstudies that I looked at,\nas well as my understanding of the logic\nof these neuro circuits,\nincluding the neuropod cells,\nbrings us to a conclusion\nthat it makes sense\nwhy if there's a population\nof neurons within our gut,\nthat responds very robustly\nto the presence of sugar,\nfatty acids, or amino acids,\nthat the intake of particular amino acids\nwould allow the dopamine pathways\nthat might otherwise be triggered by sugar\nto be triggered by\nsomething like glutamine,\nwhich has very few or no calories.\nAnd in fact, having talked\nabout this previously,\na number of people that I\nknow went out and tried this,\nnow this is of course is\nwhat I call anec data, right?\nThis is not a quality peer reviewed study,\nthis is anec data.\nMany of them have reported back\nthat they actually feel\nas if their sugar cravings\nare reduced.\nI know some people who\nactually take glutamine\nand mix it with full fat cream\nand take it kind of like\na shot of full fat cream,\nwhich sounds absolutely\ndelicious by the way,\nglutamine is a little bit chalky,\nso it's not that great\ntasting to ingest with sugar.\nI should mention, if you do\ntry and take this approach\nof ingesting glutamine\nto reduce sugar cravings,\nyou want to increase\nthe amount of glutamine\nthat you take somewhat gradually.\nIt can create some gastric distress\nif you just, you know,\nI certainly wouldn't take\na big table spoon of it,\nthrow it in water and chug\nit down three times a day.\nSome of you with very hardy stomachs\ncan probably tolerate that.\nYou know, if you're like my bulldog,\nwhich unfortunately\npassed away, but Costello,\nI always imagine that if ever\nwe did an autopsy on him,\nhe'd have like a license plate\nand like a human being in his gut,\n'cause it seemed like\nhe could ingest anything\nwith no issues,\nbut of course, many people\nhave kind of sensitive guts.\nSo if you're going to try taking glutamine\nas a means to reduce sugar cravings,\njust know that the\nstudies are still ongoing.\nSome people have achieved benefit.\nPlease also realize that\nthere's an entire literature\ndevoted to the potential\nhazards of increasing glutamine\nif you have a preexisting cancer.\nSo if you have cancer\nor you're cancer prone,\nI would really discourage\nyou from this approach.\nAnd in any case, as always,\ntalk to your doctor.\nThe logic nonetheless is there,\nwhy increasing amino acid\nintake or fatty acid intake\nmight decrease sugar craving.\nNow there are other ways\nto reduce sugar craving\nand there are certainly\nways to reduce the sharp\nrise in blood glucose that can occur\nwhen we ingest sugary sweet foods\nor even just an abundance\nof carbohydrate foods,\nand there are a huge\nnumber of these things.\nI'm going to sort of\nlayer up through the ones\nthat you might find in your\ncupboard, at the grocery store,\nand then get into some\nof the more extravagant\nor I should say, esoteric ones,\nmany of which however can be quite potent.\nThe first of which is\nsimple lemon juice, right,\nor lime juice.\nThere was an old lore\nand actually some papers,\npointing to the idea that\nthe ingestion of vinegar,\neither white vinegar or wine vinegar,\ncould somehow blunt blood glucose\nafter the ingestion of sugary foods\nor the ingestion of a lot\nof carbohydrate foods,\nor even just a big meal.\nActually, Tim Ferris, I should\nsay the great Tim Ferris,\n'cause I do have great\nrespect for the fact\nthat he seems to be about 10\nyears ahead of everything,\nboth in terms of nutrition\nand skill learning\nand things of that sort,\nmany of the things that\nhe predicted in his books,\n\"The Four Hour Body\"\nand \"The Four Hour Chef\"\nactually turned out to be\ntrue based on scientific data,\nsome of which only exists\nin the animal models,\nbut now also some predictions\nthat played out to be true\nin both the animal models\nand and the human models.\nSo I think that Tim\ncertainly deserves a hat tip\nfor the fact that he\nexperimented with these methods\nand reported his experiences\nwith those methods\nand that now some of them, many of them,\nhave been validated by\nwhat I perceive to be\nquality science.\nHe talked about the fact that,\nat least in his experiments on himself,\nthe ingestion of vinegar\ndid not seem to blunt\nblood glucose, and he was using\ncontinuous glucose monitors.\nThese incidentally, another\nexample of where Ferris\nwas early to the game and the rest of us\nare kind of just in his wake.\nHe talked about the use\nof blood glucose monitors,\nthose, I think at the time\nwere implanted below the skin.\nNowadays there are less\ninvasive blood glucose monitors,\nthings like Levels and so forth,\nand these are actually\nbecoming pretty popular.\nI've worn one of these before.\nThey're actually pretty informative.\nI learned for instance,\nthat when I go in the sauna\nthat I experience a sharp\nrise in blood glucose.\nAnd that makes sense because\nof the dehydration associated\nwith being in the sauna,\na lot of sweating,\nthe concentration of sugar\nin the bloodstream goes up.\nSo there's some other\nthings that certain foods\naffect my blood glucose\none way or another.\nIt's kind of an interesting\nand fun experiment\nthat some of you might be\ninterested in doing as well.\nRegardless, there are now\ndata pointing to the fact\nthat lemon juice and lime juice,\na couple tablespoons or so,\nif ingested before, or\neven during, or even after,\nconsumption of sugary foods,\nor I should say foods that\nsharply increase blood glucose\nor large carbohydrate meals,\ncan actually blunt the\nblood glucose response.\nAnd I did see that when I did\nmy own experiments on myself\nwith a continuous glucose monitor,\nit was kind of fun to\ndo those experiments.\nI preferred to do those experiments\nby eating somewhat larger meals\nof things that didn't\ncontain a lot of sugar.\nI saw some big increases in blood glucose\nin certain instances,\nand then I would ingest some\nlemon juice or lime juice,\ntypically mixed in with water.\nAnd sure enough, you could see a blunting\nof the blood glucose response.\nAnd of course this was\nreal time, continuous,\nhence continuous, blood\nglucose monitoring.\nSo for those of you that are interested\nin blunting your blood sugar\nresponse, certain foods,\nthat's a simple, low cost way to do that,\nif you want to explore it.\nI will say, if you are fasting\nand you already have low blood glucose,\nand you ingest lemon juice,\nor I should say some lemon juice and water\nor lime juice and water,\nbe careful because you can\nactually become hypoglycemic.\nFor the very same reasons\nthat that lemon juice\nand lime juice can blunt blood glucose\nwhen your blood glucose\nlevels are moderate to high,\nyou can also reduce blood\nglucose levels even further\nwhen blood glucose levels are low.\nNow that's lemon juice\nand lime juice there.\nBut we can't say that has\nto do with acidic things,\ngenerally.\nAnd just as a side point,\nmany of you have probably\nseen in the store,\nso called adjusted pH\nwaters or foods and drinks\nthat are supposed to adjust your pH.\nHate to break it to you,\nbut your pH is very tightly regulated\nthroughout your brain and body.\nYou do not want this to change.\nIt is entirely impossible,\nat least in any safe way,\nthat you would become\nquote unquote more alkaline\nby ingesting an alkaline\nwater or something like that.\nIt is true that the pH,\nyour alkalinity and acidity\nvaries in different\ncompartments in your body,\nthat's important.\nUnless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting,\nor there's something badly\nwrong with you, health wise,\nand you're in a really dire circumstance,\nyou don't want big shifts in your body pH\nand your body has all sorts\nof ways of buffering against\nchanges in pH.\nSo I encourage you not to fall on the,\nor hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH\nand becoming less acidic,\nand that kind of thing.\nWhen you ingest lemon juice or lime juice,\nthe mechanism by which\nit blunts blood glucose\nis probably twofold.\nOne is probably through\nthe post-ingestive effects\nof glucose in the gut,\nmeaning the way in which\nsugars are interacting\nwith neurons and other\ncomponents of your gut circuitry\nto impact things like\ngastric emptying time,\nto impact things like the\nfiring of those neuropod cells\nand their signaling to the brain.\nBut almost certainly it\nhas something to do also\nwith the perception of\nsour taste on the tongue.\nWe didn't go into this too\nmuch today, but you, of course,\ndon't just have sweet taste\nreceptors in your mouth,\nyou also have bitter taste receptors,\nyou have salty taste receptors,\nyou have sour taste\nreceptors in your mouth\nand of course, that means\nyour tongue and palate.\nAnd those are interacting.\nIf you ingest a substance that's\njust sweet or mostly sweet,\nthat causes a certain set of\neffects on your blood glucose,\nbut also your brain, dopamine,\nand the other neuro\ncircuits of your brain.\nIf you also ingest something that's sour\nlike lemon juice or lime juice,\nit adjusts the output\nof those neural circuits\nin your brain.\nSo again, where you have a situation\nwhere you have two parallel pathways,\none that's post-ingestive\ncoming from phenomenon\nwithin our gut neurons,\nbut also things like\ngastric emptying time,\nthe clearance and transfer of food,\nand the conversion of food\ninto particular nutrients\nand the circulation of\nglucose in your bloodstream\nand how it gets into the brain.\nBut also simply by\ningesting something sour,\nyou are changing the way\nthat sweet things impact your brain.\nAnd so I think it stands to reason\nthat the lemon juice/lime juice effect\nis not going to be magic.\nIt's going to have\neverything to do with the way\nthat ingesting sour foods\ncan adjust the taste.\nExcuse me, can adjust the neural response\nto taste of sweet foods.\nAnd in fact, we know based\non the beautiful work\nof Charles Zuker at\nColumbia Medical School,\nthat that's exactly what I happens.\nThey've measured the activity of neurons\nat various locations in the so-called\ntaste pathways of the brain.\nAnd they found that when particular tastes\nlike just sweet or just\nbitter or just sour\nevoke certain ensembles of neurons to fire\nin particular sequences,\nwhen sweet and sour are co-ingested,\nwhen bitter and sour are co-ingested,\nyou get distinct ensembles,\nmeaning distinct patterns of\nactivity of those neurons.\nAnd of course, distinct\npatterns of downstream activity\nwithin the brain and body.\nSo while it is still somewhat mysterious\nas to how exactly things like\nlemon juice and lime juice\ncan reduce our blood glucose spikes.\nWhen we ingest those with sweet foods\nor carbohydrate laden\nfoods, or with big meals,\nyou can use this as a tool\nwith the understanding\nthat there's a grounding in the biology\nof the way these circuits work.\nNow, some of you have\nprobably heard that cinnamon\ncan be a useful tool for\ncontrolling blood sugar.\nAnd indeed that's the case.\nIt's very clear that cinnamon can adjust\nthe rate of glucose entry into the stream,\npossibly by changing the\nrate of gastric emptying,\nit might slow the rate of gastric emptying\nand thereby also reduce the glycemic index\nof particular foods.\nSo I suppose if I were\ngoing to eat a mango,\nand I hadn't just done a\nbunch of hard training,\nI might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here.\nI always enjoy kind of\ncoming up with new ideas\nof ways that I can eat\nfoods during these podcasts.\nIn any event, there's\nsome debate out there,\nif you look online as to\nwhether or not Saigon Cinnamon,\nCassia cinnamon, excuse me,\nor Ceylon cinnamon is best\nfor purposes of blunting\nblood glucose spikes.\nBut I think the, at least\nby my read of the data\nand from what I've found,\nit doesn't really matter\nprovided it's real cinnamon.\nAnd you have to actually\nlook and make sure\nthat it's real cinnamon,\nbecause a lot of cinnamon\nthat you buy is not real.\nI do want to provide a cautionary\nnote about cinnamon however.\nCinnamon contains\nsomething called coumarin.\nwhich can be toxic at high levels.\nSo you don't want to ingest\nmore than about a teaspoon,\nmaybe a teaspoon and a\nhalf of cinnamon per day,\nbecause you'll start\nto exceed the threshold\nat which cinnamon could\nstart to be problematic.\nBut certainly if you're\ngoing to have a big meal\nor a meal that has a lot of sugar in it,\nor a lot of carbohydrate laden foods,\nand you don't want an\nincrease in blood glucose,\nyou could put cinnamon in a beverage,\nyou could put cinnamon on food\nin order to blunt that\nblood glucose increase,\nreduce the glycemic index\nby way of reducing gastric emptying time.\nAgain, just making sure\nthat you don't get out past\nthat one and a half teaspoons per day,\n'cause you really don't\nwant to start dealing\nwith any of the toxicity\nrelated to coumarin.\nSo we've talked about\nlemon juice and lime juice\nand cinnamon, these\nare kind of commonplace\nin many kitchens.\nThen of course we can venture\ninto the more esoteric\nor I would say the more advanced tools\nfor adjusting sugar intake.\nAnd the one that comes to\nmind is of course Berberine.\nBerberine is a derivative of tree bark\nand it is a very, very potent substance\nfor reducing blood glucose.\nSo much so that it is on par with\nMetformin or Glibenclamide,\nwhich are prescription\ndrugs specifically used\nto reduce blood glucose.\nSo using Berberine is a serious step,\nyou should absolutely talk\nto your doctor about it.\nI know of a number of people that use it\nto lower blood glucose when\nthey eat really large meals.\nI know the number of\npeople that are using it\nto get to some of the\nother effects of Metformin\nthat people have discussed,\nthings like activating or\ntapping into the so-called\nAMPK pathway, reducing mTOR,\nthese are people that are\naiming their activities\nat increasing longevity,\na somewhat controversial approach, still,\nbut I know many people are doing it.\nIt is true that if you ingest Berberine,\nyour blood glucose will plummet.\nAnd I point that out because\nI've actually tried it before,\nit gave me brutal headaches\nand I felt really dizzy,\nand I felt like I couldn't see straight.\nAnd actually I couldn't see\nstraight, why did it do that?\nWell, it made me hypoglycemic.\nIt actually drove my blood\nglucose down too far.\nAnd the reason it did that\nis that I took Berberine\non an empty stomach.\nI know some people can tolerate it.\nI would say, be very cautious\nabout ingesting Berberine\non an empty stomach,\nor if you are in a low carbohydrate diet,\nunless you really know what you're doing\nand you have a medical professional\nto kind of guide you through that.\nIf I took Berberine along\nwith a very large meal,\nthat included a lot of\ncarbohydrates, you know,\nI can recall the days in\nwhich Costello and I would eat\na couple of pizzas and then\nwe might get ice cream,\nthat kind of thing.\nThen I felt perfectly fine\non even up to 750 milligrams\nor a gram of Berberine.\nIt has the kind of unique\nproperty of making you feel\nnot overwhelmed by the amount\nof blood glucose increase\nthat you're experiencing\nfrom eating a big meal.\nI don't quite know how\nelse to describe it.\nIt's almost as if you can keep\neating and eating and eating,\nand of course you have to\nprotect your gastric volume.\nI mean, you only have so\nmuch space in your stomach\nto ingest food.\nI wasn't using it to gorge on\nfood, I just heard about it,\nI was interested in experimenting with it.\nI don't have any chronic\nblood sugar issues.\nBut again, when I took\nit on an empty stomach,\nit made me hypoglycemic on\na low carbohydrate intake,\nhypoglycemic, not a good experience.\nAnd again, an experience I think to avoid.\nBut provided there's a lot of\nglucose in your bloodstream,\nand certainly if you are\nof the experimental type\nor you're trying to\nregulate blood glucose,\nBerberine might be a good option.\nBut again, talk to your doctor.\nIt does have some other\ninteresting effects\nin terms of lowering total cholesterol\nthat are research supported\nof reducing insulin a little bit.\nWell, that's not surprising\nif you reduce blood glucose,\nyou're going to reduce\ninsulin because of course,\ninsulin manages blood\nglucose in the bloodstream.\nSo I would place Berberine and of course,\nMetformin and Glibenclamide in\nthe kind of the heavy hitting\npotent tools for regulating blood glucose.\nNow, this is an episode,\nnot about sugar per se,\nbut sugar viewed through the\nlens of the nervous system.\nAnd what's interesting about\nBerberine, Metformin, Glibenclamide\nand related substances,\nis that some of the\neffects are of course on\ngastric emptying or\nbuffering blood glucose\nwithin the bloodstream, et cetera.\nBut there appeared to also\nbe some neural effects\nof having chronically low glucose\nor blunting blood glucose\nthrough things like Berberine.\nAnd some of those neural effects include\nlongstanding changes in\nthe hormonal cascades\nthat are the consequence\nof having low blood sugar\nand thereby, changes\nin the neural circuits\nthat manage blood glucose overall.\nThe simple way of saying\nthis is that by maintaining\nlow to moderate blood glucose,\neither by not ingesting heavily\ncarbohydrate laden foods.\nSo here I'm speaking to the\nlow carb or the ketogenic types\nor by blunting blood\nglucose through things like\nMetformin or Berberine,\neven if ingesting carbohydrates,\nmaybe even some sugars,\nover time, it seems that\nthere's a adjustment,\nwhat we call a homeostatic regulation\nof the neural circuits\nthat control things like\nsugar craving, and indeed,\nsome people report feeling\nfewer sugar cravings over time.\nNow I didn't use Berberine for\na very long period of time,\nI've never used Metformin.\nI have experienced a somewhat\nodd but welcome phenomenon\nof with each progressive year of my life,\nI have fewer and fewer sugar cravings.\nWhy that is, I don't know.\nI suspect it might have\nsomething to do with my sleep.\nAnd I'll talk about that in a few minutes.\nBut if you're going to explore\nBerberine or Metformin or otherwise,\nin addition to working with a doctor,\nI think you should understand\nwhy you're doing it, right.\nI think that many of the\neffects can be quite potent.\nThey can happen in both the immediate term\nin terms of regulating blood glucose,\nthey can send you hypoglycemic\nif you aren't careful,\nthey can also cause longstanding changes\nto the neural circuitry that regulates\nblood sugar over time.\nSome of which might be\nwelcome changes, right?\nReduce sugar cravings for instance.\nAnd if you are really, really serious\nabout modulating blood glucose\nthrough things like Berberine,\nthe typical dose range, again,\nis anywhere from half a\ngram to 1.5 grams daily,\nthat's the typical dosages\nthat have been explored.\nAnd there are some other\nsubstances like sodium caprate\nwhich are known to augment\nthe effects of Berberine\nvia the AMPK pathways.\nThey basically can increase\nthe ability for Berberine\nto have its glucose lowering actions.\nBut that of course is getting\ninto the really potent,\nwhat I would call sharp blade tools\nfor controlling blood glucose.\nAnd listen, anytime you're\ndealing with blood glucose,\nyou are dealing with the brain's\npreferred source of fuel.\nAnd anytime you're dealing\nwith the brain's preferred source of fuel,\nyou have to be especially cautious\nabout depriving the\nbrain of what it needs.\nSo whether or not you're\nlow carb, high carb,\nyou know, keto, vegan,\ncarnivore, these substances,\nlike Berberine, are very, very potent\nand you need to take them seriously.\nThere is yet another tool for\ncontrolling sugar cravings\nand the neural circuits\nthat regulate sugar craving\nand its downstream consequences.\nAnd this tool is what I would\ncall a high performance tool,\nbut it's one that you\nprobably didn't suspect\nand that's sleep.\nI've done extensive episodes about sleep,\nand we actually have an episode\ncalled master your sleep.\nYou can find that episode\neasily at hubermanlab.com.\nIt's available in all the various formats,\nYouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera.\nand it provides a lot of tools.\nAnd on social media, I\nprovide a lot of tools,\noften we have a newsletter\nthat provides tools\non how to maximize sleep.\nWhat is the role of sleep\nin sugar metabolism,\nsugar, hunger, and the way that the brain\nregulates those things?\nWell, there's a really\nexciting study that came out\njust last year.\nThis study was published in\nthe journal, Cell Report,\na Cell Press journal, excellent journal.\nAnd the reason I love this study so much,\nis it involved having people,\nso yes, this was done in\nhumans, sleep in the laboratory.\nThat's not unusual, there's\na sleep lab at Stanford,\nthere's sleep labs elsewhere.\nBut what they did was\nthey actually measured\nfrom the breath of these people,\nand they extracted from their breath,\nthe metabolites that would allow them\nto understand what sorts of metabolism\nwas occurring in these people's bodies\nat different phases of sleep.\nAnd this is a really remarkable study.\nThey actually did this every 10 seconds\nthroughout the entire night.\nSo in little tiny 10 second bits,\nmeaning at very high resolution,\nthey could evaluate what is the metabolism\nin the brain and body\nthat people experience\nas they go from REM sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep\nto slow wave, sleep, and so on.\nAnd I'll go deeper into the\nstudy again in the future,\nbecause it's so interesting,\nand I think so important.\nBut what they discovered\nwas that each stage of sleep\nwas associated with a very\nparticular signature pattern\nof metabolism and\nparticular phases of sleep\nare associated with sugar metabolism,\nor more with fat metabolism,\nor more with other aspects of metabolism.\nAnd the reason why I think\nthis study is important\nto discuss in the context\nof today's discussion\nabout sugar in the brain,\nis that many people have experienced\nthe effects of disrupted\nsleep on their appetite.\nAnd in particular, it's been\nreported that when people\nare sleep deprived or the quality\nof their sleep is disrupted,\nthat their appetite for\nsugary food increases.\nNow that was always assumed to\nbe due to some metabolic need\nthat was triggered by\nthe sleep deprivation\nor by the poor sleep.\nBut in reading over this study,\nsome of the more important\npoints made by the authors\nrelate to the fact that well,\nsleep is known to have\nincredibly important effects\non brain and body, for\na variety of systems,\nimmune system, neural\nfunctioning, et cetera.\nThis very organized sequence of particular\nforms of metabolism being active\nduring particular phases of sleep,\nwhich are very, very well orchestrated,\nas we know, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep\nbeing orchestrated in 90 minutes,\nso-called ultradian cycles\nand so on and so forth,\nis thought to of perhaps\nset up the brain and body\nto be able to regulate\nitself in the waking hours.\nAnd therefore, when\npeople are sleep deprived\nor deprived of certain forms\nor states within sleep,\nsuch as rapid eye movement sleep,\nthat it creates a disruption\nin a particular set of metabolic pathways.\nNow we don't a leap\ntoo far from this study\nto sugar metabolism\nand the neural circuits\ncontrolling sugar metabolism.\nBut I will say this, if\nyou look at the sum total\nof the data on obesity\nor on type two diabetes\nor on metabolic syndromes of any kind,\nyou almost always see\ndisruptions in sleep.\nNow, some of those could\nbe you do to sleep apnea\ncaused by even just the\nsize of somebody's neck\nor the weight of their body.\nIn other words, we don't know\nthe direction of the effect,\nmetabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep,\nwhich disrupt metabolic syndromes.\nAnd indeed the authors point\nout quite appropriately,\nthat they don't understand the direction\nof the effects that they observe either.\nBut there is now a plethora\nof data pointing to the fact\nthat getting quality sleep each night\nhelps regulate not only appetite,\nbut also the specific forms of metabolism\nthat drive specific appetites.\nSo the takeaway is,\nwhile there are extravagant\nand potent and interesting ways\nto regulate blood glucose,\neverything from cinnamon to\nlemon juice, to Berberine,\nto sodium caprate, to behavioral tools,\nto the mere understanding of how\nthe direct and indirect pathways\ngo from the gut to dopamine, et cetera,\nif you're not establishing\nthe firm foundation\nof proper metabolism,\nall of those things are going\nto be sort of rearranging\ndeck chairs on the Titanic\nas it's sometimes described.\nSo we can't overstate the importance\nof getting regular sufficient\namount of high quality sleep,\nat least 80% of the time,\nnot for sake of immune system\nfunction, for clear thinking,\net cetera, but also for properly\nregulating our metabolism,\nincluding our sugar metabolism.\nThank you for joining\nme for this discussion\nabout sugar and the nervous system\nand how they are regulating each other\nin both the brain and body.\nIf
