    "transcript": "[upbeat music]\n- Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to\ndiscuss the gut and the brain,\nand we are going to discuss how your gut\ninfluences your brain and your\nbrain influences your gut.\nAs many of you probably know,\nthere is a phenomenon\ncalled your gut feeling,\nwhich tends to be something\nthat you seem to know\nwithout really knowing how you know it.\nThat's one version of the gut feeling.\nThe other is that you sense\nsomething in your actual gut,\nin your body, and that somehow drives you\nto think or feel or act\nin a particular way,\nmaybe to move towards something\nor to move away from something.\nNow, today, we aren't\ngoing to focus so much\non the psychology of gut feelings\nbut on the biology of gut feelings\nand how the gut and brain interact.\nBecause indeed your gut is\ncommunicating to your brain\nboth directly by way of\nneurons, nerve cells,\nand indirectly by changing\nthe chemistry of your body,\nwhich permeates up to your brain\nand impacts various\naspects of brain function.\nBut it works in the other direction, too.\nYour brain is influencing your entire gut.\nAnd when I say entire gut, I\ndon't just mean your stomach,\nI mean, your entire digestive tract.\nYour brain is impacting things\nlike how quickly your food is digesting,\nthe chemistry of your gut,\nif you happen to be\nstressed or not stressed.\nWhether or not you are under\na particular social challenge\nor whether or not you're\nparticularly happy\nwill in fact adjust the\nchemistry of your gut\nand the chemistry of your gut in turn\nwill change the way that your brain works.\nI'll put all that together for you\nin the context of what we\ncall the gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome are the\ntrillions of little bacteria\nthat live all the way\nalong your digestive tract\nand that strongly impact the\nway that your entire body works\nat the level of metabolism,\nimmune system, and brain function.\nAnd of course, we will discuss to tools,\nthings that you can do\nin order to maintain\nor improve your gut health.\nBecause as you'll also soon see,\ngut health is immensely important\nfor all aspects of our wellbeing\nat the level of our brain,\nat the level of our body,\nAnd there are simple, actionable\nthings that we can all do\nin order to optimize our gut health\nin ways that optimize\nour overall nervous system functioning.\nSo we will be sure to review those today.\nThis episode also serves\nas a bit of a primer\nfor our guest episode\nthat's coming up next week\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg\nfrom Stanford University.\nDr. Sonnenburg is a world\nexpert in the gut microbiome\nand so we will dive really\ndeep into the gut microbiome\nin all its complexity.\nWe'll make it all very simple for you.\nWe will also talk about\nactionable tools in that episode.\nThis episode is a standalone episode,\nso you'll get a lot of\ninformation and tools,\nbut if you have the opportunity\nto see this episode first,\nI think it will serve as a nice\nprimer for the conversation\nwith Dr. Sonnenburg.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI've been using Athletic Greens,\nwhich is now called AG1, since 2012\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day\nis that it covers\nall of my foundational\nvitamin and mineral needs\nand also because it contains\nhigh quality probiotics and prebiotics,\nwhich is a topic that we're\ngoing to talk a lot about today.\nWith Athletic Greens, I can\nbe sure that I'm getting\nall the vitamins and minerals that I need.\nSo if I'm missing anything in my diet,\nI can compensate for that\nwith the Athletic Greens.\nPlus it has the probiotics and prebiotics\nthat can also compensate\nfor any deficiencies\nthat I might have in creating\nthe right environment\nfor my gut microbiome.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're in the car or on a plane\nor otherwise on the move,\nand they'll give year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nWhile not everyone needs\nadditional vitamin D3,\nmany people do even if they're\ngetting sufficient sunlight.\nSo you get the year's\nsupply of vitamin D3,\nand it also has K2 in there.\nK2 has been shown to be important\nfor various aspects of calcium regulation,\ncardiovascular health, and so on.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim this special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat contains no sugar.\nIt does however contain sodium,\nmagnesium, and potassium.\nI've talked about sodium\non the podcast before.\nI think sodium can indeed be\nproblematic for some people\nwith hypertension or pre-hypertension,\nbut for many people,\nsodium is a great thing.\nIt can increase blood volume\nin ways that can be helpful to them.\nIt can improve nerve cell function in ways\nthat can be helpful to them,\nand for me, anytime I'm\nexercising and sweating a lot,\nI want to replace my electrolytes\nand that means replacing sodium\nfor adequate neuron function,\nmuscle function, and so on.\nLMNT is formulated to help anyone\nwith their electrolyte needs\nand is perfectly suited for people\nwho are following a\nketogenic, low carbohydrate,\nor paleo diet.\nLMNT contains a science-backed\nelectrolyte ratio\nof 1000 milligrams of sodium,\n200 milligrams of potassium,\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free LMNT sample pack.\nYou only pay the cost of shipping.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free sample pack.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the things that impact\nyour immediate and long-term\nhealth can only be assessed\nwith a quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get insights\ninto, for instance,\nwhat your biological age\nis and how that compares\nto your chronological age.\nNow, one of the major problems\nwith a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there is\nthat you get numbers back,\nthey'll tell you if those\nnumbers are in range\nand out of range\nbut they don't tell you\nanything about what to do\nwith that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they\nmake everything very simple\nin terms of directing you\ntowards particular protocols.\nSo these could be nutrition protocols,\nsupplementation protocols, or\nlifestyle behavioral protocols\nto help you bring those numbers\ninto the ranges that are best for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou

and your brain\ncommunicate in both directions.\nBecause as I mentioned before,\nyour gut is communicating all the time\nwith your brain and your brain\nis communicating all the time\nwith your gut.\nAnd so the two are in this\nongoing dance with one another,\nthat ordinarily is below\nyour conscious detection\nalthough you're probably\nfamiliar with the experience\nof every once in a while\ngetting a stomach ache\nor of eating something that\ndoesn't agree with you,\nor conversely eating something\nthat you find particularly delicious\nand that sensation or\nthat experience rather\nbeing a whole body experience.\nYour mind is excited about\nwhat you're eating or just ate,\nyour gut is excited about what\nyou're eating or just ate,\nand it seems to be a kind\nof unified perception\nof both brain and body.\nToday, we're going to talk\nabout how that comes about\nin the negative sense.\nLike, you know, when you meet\nsomeone you really dislike\nor when you have a stomach ache,\nand in the positive sense,\nwhen you interact with somebody\nthat you really, really like\nand you'd like to spend more\ntime with them, for instance,\nor when you eat something\nthat you really, really like\nand you'd like to spend\nmore time with that food,\nso to speak.\nNow, the gut and the brain\nrepresent what we call\na biological circuit,\nmeaning they include different stations.\nSo station A communicates with station B,\nwhich communicates with\nstation C, and so on.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nit is bidirectional.\nIt's a two-way street\nbetween gut and brain.\nI want to make the important\npoint at the outset\nthat when I say the word gut,\nwhen I refer to the gut,\nI am not just referring to the stomach.\nMost of us think that the\ngut equates to the stomach\nbecause we think of having\na gut or not having a gut\nor having a gut feeling of some sort.\nBut in the context of gut-brain signaling\nand the related microbiome,\nthe gut includes the\nentire digestive tract.\nThat's right, from start to finish\nthe entire digestive tract\nso much so that today\nwe're going to talk about,\nfor instance, the presence\nof neurons, nerve cells,\nthat reside in your gut\nthat communicate to specific\nlocations in the brain\nand cause the release of\nspecific neurochemicals,\nsuch as the neurochemical\ndopamine or serotonin,\nthat can motivate you to seek\nmore of a particular food\nor type of interaction or behavior,\nor to avoid particular foods,\ninteractions, and behaviors.\nAnd some of those neurons,\nmany of those neurons, in fact,\nreside in your intestines,\nnot in your stomach.\nThey can be in the small\nintestine or the large intestine.\nIn fact, you actually have\ntaste receptors and neurons\nlocated all along your digestive tract.\nYou have neurons that are located\nall along your digestive tract\nand they are communicating to your brain\nto impact what you think, what\nyou feel, and what you do.\nOkay, so for the gut-brain axis,\nwe need to deal with the brain part\nand then we need to\ndeal with the gut part.\nLet's just quickly talk\nabout the brain part\nbecause there the word brain\nis also a bit of a misnomer\nin that when we say the gut-brain axis,\nit does include the brain\nbut includes a lot of\nother things as well.\nSo as many of you probably know by now,\nif you're listeners of this podcast,\nand if you don't, that's fine,\nyour nervous system includes your brain\nand your spinal cord\nand those together constitute\nwhat's called the central nervous system.\nYour neural retinas,\nwhich are lining the back of your eyes\nand are the light sensing\nportion of your eyes\nare also part of your\ncentral nervous system.\nSo actually your eyes\nare part of your brain.\nThey're the only parts of your brain\nthat are outside the cranial vault.\nSo your retinas, your brain proper,\nand your spinal cord make up\nthe central nervous system.\nThe other parts of your\nnervous system constitute\nwhat's called the\nperipheral nervous system,\nwhich are the components\nof your nervous system\nthat reside outside the\nretinas, brain, and spinal cord.\nNow, this is very important\nbecause today we're going to talk a lot\nabout how the gut\ncommunicates with the brain.\nAnd it does that by way\nof peripheral nervous system components,\nmeaning nerve cells that reside in the gut\nand elsewhere in the body\nthat communicate to the brain\nand cross into the central nervous system\nto influence what you think\nand what you feel, okay?\nSo that's the nervous\nsystem part of what we call\nthe gut-brain axis,\nbrain, again, just being a shorthand\nfor including all the\nelements I just described.\nGut, as you now know,\nincludes all the elements\nof the digestive tract.\nLet's talk about the\narchitecture or the structure\nof the gut of your digestive system.\nNow, not surprisingly\nyour digestive system,\naka your gut, begins at your\nmouth and ends at your anus.\nAnd all along its length,\nthere are a series of sphincters\nthat cut off certain chambers\nof the digestive tract\nfrom the other chambers.\nNow, also along this tube that\nwe call the digestive tract,\nthere's great variation\nin the degree of acidity,\nor pH as it's sometimes called.\nThat variation in acidity\nturns out to give rise\nto different little microenvironments\nin which particular\nmicrobiota, microbacteria,\ncan thrive or fail to thrive.\nAnd so the way I'd like you to think\nabout the digestive tract,\nthis gut component of the gut-brain axis,\nis that it's not just one component.\nIt's not just your stomach\nwith a particular acidity\nand a bunch of microorganisms\nthat work particularly well\nto make you feel good\nand make your digestive\npathways work well.\nIt's a series of chambers,\nlittle microenvironments,\nin which particular microbiota thrive\nand other microbiota do not.\nAnd certain behaviors that you undertake\nand certain experiences that you have\nwill adjust those\nmicroenvironments in ways\nthat make particular\nmicrobiota, certain bacteria,\nmore likely to thrive and\nothers less likely to thrive.\nWe'll talk about how that was\nset up for you early in life.\nActually from the moment\nthat you came into the world,\nthat microbiome was being established.\nIt was actually strongly impacted\ndepending on whether or not\nyou were born by C-section\nor by vaginal birth.\nAnd it was strongly\nimpacted by who handled you\nwhen you came into the world,\nliterally the hands that were on you.\nHow much skin contact you had,\nwhether or not you were\na preemie baby or not,\nwhether or not you had pets at home,\nwhether or not you were\nallowed to play in the dirt,\nwhether or not you were\nallowed to eat snails\nor whether or not you were kept\nin a very antiseptic environment.\nAll of those experiences\nshaped these little microenvironments\nand shaped what constitutes best or worst\nfor those microenvironments, okay?\nSo you have this long tube that\nwe call the digestive tract\nand it's very, very long.\nIn fact, if we were to splay it out,\nwe were to take all the curves and turns\nout of the intestine, we would\nfind that it is very long.\nIt's approximately nine meters long.\nNow, the structure of that digestive tract\nturns out to be very important\nin terms of gut-brain signaling.\nOnce again, it's a tube\nand the hollow of that tube\nis called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.\nBut the walls of the tube\nare not necessarily smooth,\nat least not for significant portions\nof the digestive tract.\nFor much of the digestive tract,\nthere are bumps and\ngrooves that look very much\nlike the folds in the brain,\nbut these bumps and grooves\nare made up of other tissues.\nThey're made up of what's\ncalled a mucosal lining,\nso there's a lot of mucus there.\nAnd if we were to look really closely,\nwhat we'd find is that there are\nlittle hairy-like cellular processes\nthat we call microvilli\nthat are able to push things\nalong the digestive tract.\nThe microbiota reside\neverywhere along the lumen\nof the digestive tract,\nstarting at the mouth and\nall the way to the other end.\nAnd they reside within those microvilli\nand they reside within the lumen.\nAnd if we were to look really closely\nat the bumps and grooves\nalong the digestive tract,\nwhat we would find is that\nthere are little niches,\nlittle areas in which particular things\ncan grow and reside best.\nNow, that might sound kind of gross,\nbut it actually is a good thing,\nespecially what's growing\nand residing there\nare microbacterial organisms\nthat are good for your gut\nand that signal good things to your brain.\nAnd we will talk about what\nthat signaling looks like\nand how that's done and\naccomplished in just a few moments.\nBut I want you to get a clear\nmental picture of your gut,\nsomething that we don't often see.\nAnd often when we think about the gut,\nagain, we just think about\nthe hollow of the stomach,\nfood going in there, and getting digested,\nbut it's far more complex\nand actually far more\ninteresting than that.\nNow, I've been referring\nto the gut microbiome\nand to the microbiota and these bacteria.\nLet me define those terms a\nlittle bit more specifically\njust to avoid any confusion.\nThe microbiota are the actual bacteria.\nThe microbiome is used\nto refer to the bacteria\nbut also all the genes as bacteria make,\nbecause it turns out that\nthey make some important genes\nthat actually impact all of us.\nYou have loads and loads\nof these little\nmicrobiota, these bacteria.\nIn fact, right now you\nare carrying with you\nabout two to three kilograms,\nso that's more than six pounds,\nof these microbiota, these bacteria.\nAnd if we were to look at\nthem under a microscope,\nwhat we would see\nis these are relatively\nsimple little organisms.\nSome remain stationary\nso they might plop down\ninto the mucosal lining\nor they might hang out on\na particular microvilli\nor they might be in one\nof those little niches,\nand others can move about,\nbut they basically fill the entire lumen.\nThey surround and kind of coat the surface\nof the microvilli and they're tucked up\ninto any of those little niches\nthat are available to them\nto tuck into.\nIf you were to take the head of a pin\nand look at it under the microscope,\nyou could fit many, many hundreds,\nif not thousands or more of\nthese little microbacteria.\nAnd the reason I say many,\nmany thousands or more,\nI'm giving a kind of broad range there,\nis that they do vary in size\nand, again, they vary as to\nwhether or not they can move\nor they don't move.\nNow, they're constantly\nturning over in your gut,\nmeaning they're being born so to speak\nand they're dying off.\nAnd some will stay there\nfor very long periods\nof time within your gut\nand others will get excreted.\nAbout 60% of your stool,\nas unpleasant as that\nmight be to think about,\nis made up of live and dead microbacteria.\nSo you're constantly making\nand excreting these microbacteria.\nAnd which microbacteria you make\nand how many stay inside\nyour gut and how many leave,\nmeaning how many are excreted,\ndepends a lot on the chemistry of your gut\nand depends very strongly\non the foods that you eat\nand the foods that you do not eat.\nNow, just because what we\neat strongly influences\nour microbiome, meaning our microbacteria,\ndoes not mean that there\nare not other influences\non what constitutes our microbiome.\nOur microbiome is also\nmade up by microbacteria\nthat access our digestive\ntract through our mouth,\nthrough breathing, through kissing,\nand through skin contact.\nIn fact, one of the major\ndeterminants of our microbiome\nis who we interact with\nand the environment\nthat we happen to be in.\nAnd that actually includes whether or not\nwe interact with animals.\nIn a little bit, I'll talk about some data\nas to whether or not you grew\nup in a home that had animals,\nwhether or not you grew up in the home,\nwhether or not there was\na lot of social contact,\nmeaning skin contact,\nor whether or not you grew up\nin a more animal sparse,\ncontact sparse environment\nand how that shapes your microbiome.\nBut the simple point is that what you eat\ninfluences your microbiome,\nbut also what you do,\nwhat you think, and what you feel,\nand many of the low microbacteria\nthat get into your digestive tract\ndo so by way of social interactions.\nIn fact, if you ask a neurobiologist\nwhat the role of the microbiome is,\nthey'll tell you almost certainly\nthat it's there to impact brain function.\nBut if you have friends\nthat are microbiologists,\nsuch as I do, they'll tell you,\nwell, maybe the brain and\nnervous system are there\nto support the microbiome.\nIt's the other way around.\nYou have all these little microorganisms\nthat are taking residence in our body.\nThey don't really know what\nthey're doing as far as we know.\nWe don't know that they have\nconsciousness or they don't.\nWe can't rule that out, but\nit seems pretty unlikely.\nNonetheless, they are taking advantage\nof the different environments\nall along your digestive tract.\nThey are taking advantage\nof the sorts of social interactions,\nfor instance, the people you talk to\nand that breathe on you,\nthe people that you shake hands with,\nthe people that you kiss or don't kiss,\nthe people that you happen to be\nromantically involved with or not,\nyour dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,\nwhatever pet you happen to own\nis impacting your microbiome.\nThere's absolutely no question about that.\nSo hopefully now you have\nsome sense of the architecture\nof the digestive pathway\nand you have some sense of the trillions\nof little microbacteria that are living\nall along the different components\nof that digestive pathway.\nBut what we haven't talked about yet,\nand what I'd like to talk about now,\nis what those little\nmicrobiota are actually doing\nin your digestive tract.\nIn addition to just living there\nfor their own intents and purposes,\nthey are contributing, for\ninstance, to your digestion.\nMany of the genes that\nthose microbiota make\nare genes that are\ninvolved in fermentation\nand genes that are involved in digestion\nof particular types of nutrients.\nAnd in a little bit, we will talk\nabout how what you eat can\nactually change the enzymes\nthat those microbiome components make,\nenzymes largely being things\nthat are responsible for digestion.\nThey catalyze other\nsorts of cellular events\nbut in the context of\nthe digestive pathway,\nwe're talking about enzymes\nthat help digest your food.\nSo those microbiota are indeed\nhelping you in many ways.\nAnd if you lack certain microbiota\nthat can help you digest,\nit stands to reason that\nyou would have challenges\ndigesting certain types of foods.\nThe other amazing thing\nthat these microbiota do\nis they change the way\nthat your brain functions\nby way of metabolizing or facilitating\nthe metabolism of particular\nneurotransmitters.\nSo one of the ways that having\ncertain microbiota present\nin your gut can improve your\nmood or degrade your mood,\nfor instance, is by way\nof certain microbiota\nbeing converted into or\nfacilitating the conversion\nof chemicals, such as GABA.\nGABA is what we call an\ninhibitory neurotransmitter.\nIt's involved in suppressing the action\nof other neurons.\nAnd that might sound like a bad thing,\nbut all types of sedatives, for instance,\nalcohol, and a lot of neurons\nthat naturally make GABA\ncan help quiet certain\ncircuits in the brain,\nfor instance, circuits\nresponsible for anxiety.\nIn people who have epilepsy,\nthe GABAergic neurons, as they're called,\ncan all often be disrupted\nin their signaling,\nmeaning they're not\ncranking out as much GABA\nand therefore the excitatory neurons,\nwhich typically release other\nmolecules like glutamate\ncan engage in what's\ncalled runaway excitation\nand that can give rise to seizures.\nSo the simple message here\nis that the microbiota\nby way of making neurochemicals\ncan influence the way\nthat your brain functions.\nSo you want to support those microbiota\nand we will give you tools\nto support those microbiota.\nBut the takeaway at this point\nis that those microbiota\nare making things locally\nto help digest food.\nOther microbiota are helping to make\ncertain neurotransmitters like GABA,\nand we'll also talk about\ndopamine and serotonin.\nAnd so the very specific\nmicrobiota that reside in your gut\nhave a profound influence\non many, many biological functions,\nespecially immune system function,\nbrain function, and digestion.\nSo that should give you\na fairly complete picture\nof your gut microbiome.\nNow I'd like to talk\nabout how your microbiome\nand your brain communicate,\nor more accurately, how your microbiome\nand the rest of your\nnervous system communicate.\nNeurons, which simply means nerve cells,\nare the cells that do\nmost of the heavy lifting\nin your nervous system.\nThere are of course other\ncell types that are important.\nGlial cell, for instance, very,\nvery important cell types.\nYou have endothelial cells,\nwhich are responsible for blood flow,\npericytes and other types of cells,\nbut the neurons are really\ndoing most of the heavy lifting\nfor most of the things we think about\nin terms of nervous system function.\nYou have neurons in your gut\nand that should not surprise you.\nNeurons reside in your brain,\nyour spinal cord, your eyes,\nin fact, all over your body,\nand you've got them on your\nheart and in your heart,\nand you've got them in your lungs,\nand you've got them in your spleen,\nand they connect to all\nthe different organs\nand tissues of your body.\nSo that's not surprising that\nyou have neurons in your gut.\nWhat is surprising, however,\nis the presence of\nparticular types of neurons\nthat reside near or in the mucosal lining\njust next to that lumen of the gut\nand that are paying attention,\nand I'll explain what I\nmean by paying attention,\nto the components of the\ngut, both the nutrients\nand the microbiota,\nand thereby can send signals\nup to the brain by way of a long wire\nthat we call an axon, and can communicate\nwhat the chemistry and what\nthe nutritional quality\nand what the other aspects of\nthe environment are at the gut\nat a given location up to the brain\nin ways that can influence\nthe brain to, for instance,\nseek out more of a particular food.\nLet me give you a sort of\naction-based picture of this.\nLet's say like most people,\nyou enjoy sweet foods.\nI don't particularly enjoy sweet foods\nbut there are a few that I like.\nI'm a sucker for a really\ngood dark chocolate\nor really good ice cream\nor I got this thing for donuts\nthat seems to just not quit\nalthough I don't tend to\nindulge it very often,\nI do like them.\nIf I eat that particular food,\nobviously digestion starts in the mouth.\nThere are enzymes there,\nit gets chewed up,\nthe food goes down into the gut.\nThese neurons are activated,\nmeaning that causes the neurons\nto be electrically active\nwhen particular components,\ncertain nutrients in\nthose foods are present.\nAnd for the cell types,\nor I should say the neuron\ntypes that matter here,\nthe nutrients that really\ntrigger their activation\nare sugar, fatty acids,\nand amino acids.\nNow, these particular neurons\nhave the name enteroendocrine cells\nbut more recently they've been\ndefined as neuropod cells.\nNeuropod cells were discovered\nby Diego Bohorquez's\nlab at Duke University.\nThis is a phenomenal set of discoveries\nmade mostly in the last 10 years.\nThese neuropod cells, as I mentioned,\nare activated by sugar,\nfatty acids, or amino acids,\nbut have a particularly\nstrong activation to sugars.\nThey do seem to be part of\nthe sweet sensing system.\nAnd even though I'm focusing\non this particular example,\nthey represent a really nice example\nof how a particular set\nof neuro cells in our gut\nis collecting information\nabout what is there\nat a particular location in the gut,\nand sending that\ninformation up to our brain.\nNow, they do that by\nway of a nerve pathway\ncalled the vagus nerve.\nThe vagus nerve is part of\nthe peripheral nervous system.\nAnd the vagus nerve is a\nlittle bit complex to describe\nif you're just listening to this.\nIf you are watching this,\nI'll try and use my hands as a diagram\nbut really the best thing to do\nif you want really want\nto learn neuroanatomy\nis to just imagine it in\nyour mind as best you can\nand if you can track down\na picture of it, terrific,\nbut here's how it works.\nNeurons have a cell body\nthat we call a soma,\nthat's where all the DNA are contained.\nThat's where a lot of\nthe operating machinery\nof the cells are contained\nand a lot of the\ninstructions for that cell\nof what to be and how to\noperate are contained.\nThe cell bodies of these\nneurons or the relevant neurons\nare actually up near the neck.\nSo you can think of them\nas a clump of grapes,\n'cause cell bodies tend\nto be round or oval-ish.\nAnd then they send a\nprocess that we call an axon\nin one direction out to the gut\nand they'll send another\nprocess up into the brain.\nAnd that little cluster near the neck\nthat's relevant here is called\nthe nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.\nThe nodose ganglion is a\nlittle cluster of neurons\non either side of the neck.\nIt has a process that goes out to the gut\nand a process that goes up into the brain.\nAnd again, these are just one component\nof the so-called vagus nerve.\nThe vagus nerve has many, many branches,\nnot just to the gut.\nThere are also branches to the liver,\nbranches to the lungs,\nbranches to the heart,\nbranches to the larynx,\nand even to the spleen,\nand other areas of the\nbody that are important.\nBut right now we're just\nconcentrating on the neurons\nthat are in the gut that\nsignal up to the brain.\nAnd what the Bohorquez lab has shown\nis that these neuropod\ncells are part of network.\nThey're sensing several\ndifferent nutrients,\nbut in particular, when they sense sugar,\nthey send signals in the\nform of electrical firing\nup to the brain in ways\nthat trigger activation\nof other brain stations that\ncause you to seek out more\nof that particular food.\nNow, this brings us to\nsome classic experiments\nthat at least to me are incredible.\nAnd these are highly reproducible findings\nshowing, for instance,\nthat even if you bypass taste\nby infusing sweet liquid\nor putting sweet foods into the gut,\nand people can never taste\nthem with their mouth,\npeople will seek out more\nof that particular food.\nAnd if you give them the option\nto have a sweet food\ninfused into their gut\nor a bitter food infused into their gut\nor a sweet versus sour,\nor a more sweet versus less sweet food,\npeople have a selective\npreference for sweet foods\neven if they can't taste them.\nNow, this is important to understand\nin the context of gut-brain signaling\nbecause we always think\nthat we like sweet foods\nbecause of the way they taste.\nAnd indeed that's still true,\nbut much of what we consider\nthe great taste of a sweet food\nalso has to do with a gut sensation\nthat is below our conscious detection.\nHow do we know that?\nWell, the Bohorquez lab\nhas performed experiments\nusing modern methods and\nthey're classic experiments\nshowing that animals and humans\nwill actively seek out more\nof a particular sweet food\neven if it bypasses this taste system.\nAnd the reverse is also true.\nThere have been experiments\ndone in animals and in humans\nthat have allowed animals or humans\nto select and eat sweet foods,\nand indeed that's what they do\nif they're given the option.\nAnd yet to somehow eliminate\nthe activation of these neurons\nwithin the gut that can sense sweet foods.\nNow, there are a couple different ways\nthat those experiments ave been done.\nIn classic experiments\nthat date back to the '80s,\nthis was done by what's called\nsubdiaphragmatic vagotomy.\nSo this means cutting off\nthe branch of the vagus\nthat enervates the gut below the diaphragm\nso that the other organs\ncan still function\nbecause the vagus is very important,\nbut basically cutting off\nthe sweet sensing in the gut,\nstill giving people the\nopportunity to taste sweet foods\nwith their mouth,\nand they don't actively seek out\nquite as much of the sweet food\nwhen they don't have this\ngut sensing mechanism\nthat we now know to be dependent\non these neuropod cells.\nMore recent experiments\ninvolve selective silencing\nof these neuropod cells.\nAnd there have been a lot\nof different derivations\nof this sort of thing,\nbut the takeaway from it\nis that our experience of\nand our desire for particular foods\nhas everything to do with\nhow those foods taste.\nIt also has to do, as you probably know,\nwith their texture and the\nsensation of those foods\nin our mouth, and even indeed\nhow they go down our throat\nsometimes can be very\npleasing or very unpleasant.\nAnd it also has to do with\nthis subconscious processing\nof taste that occurs in the gut itself.\nAnd again, when I say gut, I\ndon't just mean in the stomach.\nThere are actually\nneurons, neuropod cells,\nfurther down your digestive tract\nwhich are signaling to your brain\nabout the presence of sweet foods,\nas well as foods such\nas amino acid rich foods\nor foods that are rich in\nparticular types of fatty acids\nsignaling up to your brain\nand causing you to seek\nout more of those foods\nor to consume more of those foods.\nNow, you're probably\nasking, what is the signal?\nHow does it actually make\nme want more of those foods\nwithout me realizing it?\nWell, it does that by\nadjusting the release\nof particular neuromodulators.\nFor those of you that are not\nfamiliar with neuromodulators,\nthese are similar to neurotransmitters,\nbut they tend to act more broadly.\nThey tend to impact many\nmore neurons all at once\nand they go by names\nlike dopamine, serotonin,\nacetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.\nSometimes people refer to\nthose as neurotransmitters.\nTechnically they are neuromodulators.\nI'll refer to them almost\nalways as neuromodulators.\nThe neuropod cells signal by way\nof a particular branch of the vagus\nthrough that nodose ganglion\nthat we talked about before\nand through a number of different stations\nin the brain stem,\neventually cause the release\nof the neuromodulator dopamine.\nDopamine is often associated\nwith a sense of pleasure and reward\nbut it is more appropriately\nthought of as a neuromodulator\nthat impacts motivation,\ncraving, and pursuit.\nIt tends to put us into modes of action,\nnot necessarily running\nand moving through space,\nalthough it can do that too,\nbut in the context of feeding,\nit tends to make us look around more,\nchew more, reach for things more,\nand seek out more of whatever it is\nthat's giving us that sensation\nof delight or satisfaction.\nAnd again, that sense of\ndelight and satisfaction,\nyou might experience only consciously\nas the way that something\ntastes on your mouth\nbut it actually is caused again\nby both the sensations in your mouth\nbut also by the activation\nof these neuropod cells.\nSo this is an incredible\nsystem of gut-brain signaling,\nand it is but one system\nof gut-brain signaling.\nIt turns out it's the system\nthat we know the most about\nat this point in time.\nThere are other components\nof gut-brain signaling\nthat we'll talk about in\na moment, for instance,\nthe serotonin system.\nBut in terms of examples\nof gut-brain signaling\nfor which we know a lot\nof the individual elements\nand how they work,\nI think this neuropod, neuron\nsensing of sweet foods,\nfatty acids, and amino acids in the gut\nand communicating that up to the brain\nby way of the vagus and causing us\nto seek out more of the foods\nthat deliver those nutrients\nis an incredible pathway\nthat really delineates\nthe beauty and the power\nof this gut-brain axis.\nLet me talk about timescales.\nHere I'm talking about a\nparticular type of neuron\nthat is signaling up to the\nbrain using electrical signals\nto cause us to want to seek out\na particular category of foods.\nThat's happening relatively fast\ncompared to the hormone\npathways of the gut\nwhich also involve neurons.\nSo your gut is also\ncommunicating to your brain\nby way of neurons, nerve cells.\nBut some of those nerve\ncells also release hormones.\nAnd those hormones go by names like CCK,\nglucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera.\nA good example of a hormone pathway,\nor what's sometimes called\na hormone peptide pathway,\nthat is similar to the pathway\nI've talked about before\nbut a little bit slower\nis the ghrelin pathway.\nGhrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N,\nincreases with fasting.\nSo the longer it's been\nsince you've eaten,\nor if you're just eating very little food\ncompared to your caloric needs,\nghrelin levels are going to\ngo up in your bloodstream\nand they go up because of processes\nthat include processes within the gut\nand include the nervous system.\nSo it's a slow pathway driving you\nto seek out food generally.\nAs far as we know, the\nghrelin system is not partial\nto seeking out of sweet foods\nor fatty foods or so on.\nGhrelin increases the longer it's been\nsince you've eaten sufficient calories\nand it stimulates a feeling of\nyou wanting to seek out food.\nWell, how does it do that?\nIt does that again by\nimpacting neural circuits\nwithin the brain, neural\ncircuits that include\nwhat we call the brain\nstem autonomic center.\nSo it tends to make you feel alert\nand quite, we say, high\nlevels of autonomic arousal.\nIf you haven't eaten in a while,\nyou might think that you just\nget really exhausted, right?\nBecause we all hear that food is energy\nand caloric energy is\nwhat we need to burn,\nbut you actually have a lot\nof energy stored in your body\nthat you would be able to use\nif you really needed energy.\nBut typically if we\nhaven't eaten in a while,\nwe start to get agitated\nand we get agitated by way way of release\nof the neuromodulator epinephrine,\nwhich causes us to look\naround more, move around more,\nand seek out food.\nThat all occurs in brain\nstem autonomic centers\nand in the hypothalamus.\nWe did an entire episode\non feeding behavior\nand metabolism as well\nand you can find those\nepisodes at hubermanlab.com\nso I don't want to go into a lot of detail\nabout hypothalamic and\nbrains stem centers.\nBut there's a particular area of the brain\ncalled the nucleus of the solitary tract,\nthe NST as it's called,\nthat's very strongly impacted\nby these circulating hormones\nand tends to drive us\ntoward feeding behavior.\nSo the important point here\nis that we have a fast system\nthat is paying attention\nto the nutrients in our gut\nor the absence of nutrients in our gut,\nand stimulating us to seek out food\nor to stop eating certain foods,\nand we have a slower\nhormone-related system\nthat also originates in the\ngut and impacts the brain.\nBut all of those converge on\nneural circuits for feeding.\nThe neural circuits for feeding\ninclude things like the arcuate\nnucleus of the hypothalamus,\nthey include a bunch of\nother neurochemicals,\nbut the point is that\nyou've got a fast route\nand a slow route to drive\nyou to eat more or eat less,\nright, to seek out food and\nconsume it or to stop eating,\nto essentially kickstart\nthe satiety mechanisms\nas they're called,\nand those are operating in parallel.\nIt's not like one happens first\nthen stops then the other.\nThey're always operating in parallel.\nAnd I bring this up because\nthere's a bigger theme here\nwhich we see over and\nover again in biology,\nwhich is the concept of parallel pathways.\nYou've always got multiple\naccelerators and multiple brakes\non a system.\nIt's very, very rare to\nhave just one accelerator\nand one brake on the system.\nAnd this will become important later\nwhen we talk about tools for\noptimizing your gut microbiome\nfor healthy eating and for\nhealth healthy digestion\nand for healthy brain function.\nI want to take a moment and talk\nabout glucagon-like peptide 1,\nwhich is also called GLP-1.\nGLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut\nand by neurons in the brain.\nThis is a fairly recent discovery\nbut it's an important one.\nGLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding\nand tends to reduce appetite.\nThere are a number of drugs\nreleased on the market now,\none for instance goes\nby the name semaglutide,\nwhich is essentially an GLP-1 agonist.\nIt causes the release of more GLP-1.\nIt's being used to treat type II diabetes,\nwhich is insulin resistant diabetes.\nThis is different than type I diabetes\nwhere people don't actually make insulin.\nIt's also being used as\na drug to reduce obesity.\nAnd it seems pretty effective\nat least in certain populations.\nThere are certain foods and\nsubstances that increase GLP-1.\nI've talked about a few\nof these on the podcast.\nOne that I'm a particular fan\nof for entirely other reasons\nis yerba mate tea can\nstimulate the release of GLP-1.\nIn South America, it's often used\nas an appetite suppressant,\nprobably in large part\nbecause of its effect on GLP-1 release,\nbut probably also because\nit does contain caffeine,\nwhich is a bit of a stimulant,\nwhich also can be involved in lipolysis,\nwhich is the utilization of fat stores\nfor energy and so forth.\nA brief mention about yerba mate.\nThere are some reports\nout there that yerba mate\ncan increase certain types of cancers.\nThe data that I've seen on this\nis that it tends to\nrelate to whether or not\nthose are smoked versions\nof the yerba mate tea,\nthe amount of consumption,\nand the debate is still out.\nSo I invite you to look at those papers.\nYou can search for those online.\nNonetheless, yerba mate is one\nsource of GLP-1 stimulation.\nSemaglutide is another source.\nIt also can be stimulated\nby various foods, nuts,\navocados, eggs, and so forth.\nCertain high fiber complex grains\nwill also stimulate GLP-1.\nI raise this as not necessarily a route\nthat you want to take in\norder to reduce food intake.\nI don't even know that that's your goal.\nBut that GLP-1 is another one\nof these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms\nthat adjusts appetite\nthat is dependent on diet,\ndepends on what you eat or drink,\nand that the GLP-1 pathway\ndoes seem particularly sensitive\nto the constituents of diet.\nThere's at least one quality study\nI was able to find showing\nthat the ketogenic diet for instance,\nwhich almost always involves ingestion\nof very low levels of carbohydrate\ncan increase GLP-1.\nAlthough, as I mentioned before,\nthere are other foods that fall\noutside the range of what\nwe would consider ketogenic\nthat can also stimulate GLP-1,\nand as I mentioned,\nthere are prescription\ndrugs, like semaglutide,\nthere are other ones as well now,\nthat stimulate GLP-1.\nSo how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?\nIt does that, in part, by\nchanging the activity of neurons\nin the hypothalamus,\nthis cluster of neurons just\nabove the roof of our mouth,\nthat themselves make GLP-1\nand that cause the\nactivation of motor circuits\nfor reaching, chewing, all the things\nthat we associate with feeding behavior.\nSo I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway\nthat you might choose to tap into\nby ingestion of yerba mate\nor by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,\nor if it's something that\ninterests you, ketogenic diet.\nBut I also mention it simply\nbecause it's another beautiful example\nof how a hormone pathway\ncan impact the activity\nof brain circuits that\nare directly involved\nin a particular behavior.\nSo yet another example of how\ngut is communicating to brain\nin order to change what we think we want\nor to change what our\nactual behaviors are.\nSo the next time you find\nyourself reaching for food,\nor you find yourself wanting\na particular sweet thing\nor fatty thing or something that contains\na lot of amino acids,\na protein rich food,\nkeep in mind that that's not just\nabout the taste of the food,\nand it's not even necessarily\nabout the nutrients\nthat you need or don't need.\nIt could be,\nbut it's also about this\nsubconscious signaling\nthat's coming from your body all the time,\nwaves of hormones, waves\nof nerve cell signals,\nelectrical signals that\nare changing the way\nthat your brain works.\nAnd this raises for me\na memory of the episode that I\ndid with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,\nwho's a world expert\ncolleague of mine at Stanford,\nwho is expert on things\nlike hormones and behavior.\nBut we got into the topic of free will,\nwhich is a bit of a barbed wire topic\nas many of you know.\nIt gets into the realm\nof philosophy, et cetera.\nAnd we were kind of batting back and forth\nthe idea, I was saying, \"Well,\nI think there's free will,\nand can't there certainly be free will\nor certainly the idea that we\ncan avoid certain choices?\"\nAnd Robert was saying, \"No.\"\nIn fact, he said, \"Nah,\"\nhe doesn't believe\nthat we have any free will.\nHe thinks that events in\nour brain are determined\nby biological events that are\nbelow our conscious detection\nand that occur seconds to milliseconds\nbefore we make decisions or assessments\nand, therefore, we just\ncan't control what we do,\nwhat we think, and what we feel.\nAnd at the time I sort of didn't buy it.\nI thought, I don't know.\nI just, I guess I really\nwanted to believe in free will.\nAnd to some extent I still do\nbut as we talk about how\nthese neurons in our gut\nand these hormones in our\ngut are influencing our brain\nand the decisions that we are making,\nat the level of circuits,\nlike the hypothalamus\nand the nucleus of the solitary tract,\nthese are areas of the brain\nway below our frontal cortex\nand our conscious perception.\nThink these are examples that really fall\nin favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,\nwhich is that events that\nare happening within our body\nare actually changing\nthe way our brain works.\nSo we might think that\nwe want the cupcake.\nWe might think that we\ndon't need to eat something\nor do need to eat something\nand that is entirely on the\nbasis of prior knowledge\nand decision-making that\nwe're making with our head,\nbut in fact,\nit's very clear to me based on the work\nfrom the Bohorquez lab,\nclassic work over the years\ndating back to the '80s,\nand indeed back to the '50s\nthat we'll talk about in a moment,\nthat our body is shaping the decisions\nthat our brain is making and\nwe're not aware of it at all.\nNow, the good news is that\nwhether or not you believe\nin free will or not, the simple knowledge\nthat this whole process is happening\ncan perhaps be a benefit to you.\nYou can perhaps leverage\nit to get some insight\nand understanding and perhaps even a wedge\ninto your own behavior.\nYou might think, ah, I think\nI want that particular food,\nor I think I want to avoid\nthat particular food,\nbut actually that's not a decision\nthat I'm making on a\npurely rational basis.\nHas a lot to do with what\nmy gut is telling my brain.\nSo we've largely been talking\nabout chemical communication\nbetween the gut and the brain.\nChemical because even\nthough these neuropod cells\nare communicating with the brain\nby way of electrical activity,\nwhat we call action potentials,\nand in neural language\nwe call those spikes,\nspikes of action potentials,\nspikes of action potentials,\nmeaning those neural signals,\ncause the release of chemicals\nin the brain like dopamine.\nSo it's chemical transmission.\nSimilarly, hormones, even\nthough they act more slowly,\nhormones like neuropeptide\nY like CCK, like ghrelin,\nthey are signaling chemically.\nThey're moving through the body,\nthey're going in there\naffecting the chemical output\nof different cells,\nand they're changing the\nchemistry of those cells\nand the chemistry of the cells\nthat those cells talk to.\nSo that gives us one particular\ncategory of signaling\nfrom gut to brain, which\nis chemical signaling.\nBut of course there are\nother forms of signals\nand those fall under the\ncategory of mechanical signaling.\nYou're probably familiar with this.\nIf you've ever eaten a very large meal\nor consumed a lot of fluid,\nyou experience that as\ndistension of the gut\nand that doesn't just have to\nbe distension of the stomach,\nbut distension of your intestines as well.\nThat distension is registered by neurons\nthat reside in your gut,\nthe signals go up to your brain,\nand communicate with areas of the brain\nthat are responsible for suppressing\nfurther consumption of food and/or fluid,\nand, under certain circumstances,\ncan also be associated with the activation\nof neural circuits that cause vomiting\nor the desire to vomit.\nSo if ever you've eaten too\nmuch or you've eaten something\nthat doesn't agree with you,\nthat information is communicated\nby way of mechanosensors\nthat sense the mechanics of your gut,\npossibly also the chemistry of your gut,\nbut mostly the mechanics of your gut,\nsignal up to the brain,\nand activate brain\ncenters that are involved\nin stopping the eating behavior,\nand activation of an\narea of the brain stem\nthat is affectionately referred to\nas the vomit center among neuroanatomists.\nThis is a area that more appropriately\nis called the chemoreceptor\ntrigger zone, the CTZ,\nor area postrema\nand neurons in this area\nactually will trigger\nthe vomiting reflex.\nSo the way that the gut\nand the brain communicate\nis both chemical and mechanical,\nand it can be both for sake\nof increasing certain types of behavior.\nToday, we're talking mainly\nabout feeding behavior\nup until now anyway\nbut also ceasing to\neat, closing your mouth,\nmoving away from food,\nturning away from food,\nall behaviors that we're familiar with\nanytime we feel kind of sick\non the basis of activation\nof this mechanosensor\nfor gastric distress.\nSo we've got chemical signaling\nand mechanical signaling.\nAnd I also want to emphasize that we have\ndirect and indirect signaling\nfrom the gut to the brain.\nDirect signaling is the kind of signaling\nof the sort I've been talking\nabout mainly up until now,\nwhich is neurons in the gut\ncommunicating with\nneurons in the brain stem\nthat communicate with\nneurons in the hypothalamus.\nAnd, of course, those are\nalso going to interact\nwith neurons of the prefrontal cortex\nwhich is the area of a brain\ninvolved in decision making\nthe, you know, I think it was\nthe shrimp that made me sick.\nI'm going to, I just don't\nwant any more of that.\nOr I'm never going back\nto that restaurant again\nbecause after I ate there\nabout an hour later,\nI started feeling really not well.\nI felt, you know, kind of feverish,\nbut my gut didn't feel well,\nmy digestion was really off.\nAll of that kind of information\nis handled in the prefrontal\ncortex at a conscious level,\nbut the immediate decision to stop eating\nor to eat more of something\nto move towards something\nor away from it, that's\nmade by neural circuits\nthat reside at the, we would say,\nthe subconscious level\nbut what we really mean is below\nthe level of the neocortex.\nBelow the cortex means\nessentially below our level\nof conscious awareness.\nSo we talked about two types\nof information within the gut\nthat are communicated to the brain,\nchemical information, meaning information\nabout the nutrients\nthat happen to be there,\nand mechanical information,\ndistention of the gut or lack\nof distention and so forth.\nAnd we talked about how\nthese neuropod cells\ncan signal the release\nof dopamine and circuits\nwithin the brain to cause you\nto seek out more of something.\nNow, in a very logically consistent way,\ndopamine is also involved in\nthe whole business of vomiting.\nYou might think, well, that\ndoesn't make any sense.\nI thought dopamine was\nalways a good thing.\nIt's involved in moderation\nand reward, et cetera.\nBut it turns out the area postrema,\nthis vomit center in the brain stem,\nis chockablock full of dopamine receptors.\nAnd if dopamine levels go too high,\nit can actually trigger vomiting.\nAnd this we see in the\ncontext of various drugs\nthat are used to treat\nthings like Parkinson's.\nParkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine\nor a lack of dopamine neurons typically\nthat causes a resting tremor,\ndifficulty in movement,\nbecause dopamine's also associated\nwith a lot of the neural\ncircuits for movement.\nMany drugs that are used\nto treat Parkinson's\nlike L-DOPA increase\nlevels of dopamine so much,\nor at least activate dopamine receptors\nto such a great degree in\ncertain areas of the brain\nthat they can cause activation of things\nlike the trigger to vomit.\nNow, this should also make\nsense in the natural context\nof if you gorge yourself with food,\ngorge yourself with food,\ngorge yourself with food,\nthe neurons in your gut\nthat respond to that\nare simply detecting the\npresence of nutrients\nbut they don't really\nmake decisions themselves.\nThey don't know to stop eating.\nYour brain knows to stop\neating or to eject that food.\nAnd so it's a wonderful\nthing that those neurons\nare communicating with areas of the brain\nnot just that stimulate\nconsuming more food\nbut that are communicating\nwith areas of the brain,\nfor instance, area postrema,\nthat when dopamine levels get too high,\ncause us to either stop eating that food\nor in the case of vomiting\nto eject that food.\nSo I raise this not to give you\na kind of a disgusting counterexample\nto what we call appetitive behaviors,\nthe things that we like to do more of,\nbut simply to give you a\nsense of just how strongly\neven these reflexes that we think of\nas feeling sick and vomiting\nor the desire to seek out more food\nare really being controlled\nby a kind of push-pull system,\nby parallel pathways that\nare arriving from our gut\nand the same neurochemicals,\nin this case dopamine,\nare being used to create\ntwo opposite type behaviors,\none behavior to consume more,\none behavior to get rid of everything\nyou've already consumed.\nSo our brain is actually sensitive\nto the amount of signaling\ncoming from our gut\nnot just the path by\nwhich that signal arrives.\nOur brain is very\ncarefully paying attention\nto whether or not the levels of dopamine\nthat are being triggered\nare within a normal range\nfor typical eating behavior\nor whether or not we've gorged ourselves\nto the point where enough already.\nNow, of course, mechanical signals\nwill also play into area postrema\nand into the vomiting reflex.\nIf we have a very distended gut,\nwe feel lousy.\nIt just, it actually can hurt very badly,\nand we will have the desire to vomit,\nor we will just simply vomit.\nMechanical and chemical signals\nare always arriving in parallel.\nThey never work in unison.\nAnd so now we have chemical\nsignals, mechanical signals,\nand now I'd like to talk about\ndirect and indirect signals\nbecause almost everything\nI've talked about up until now\nare direct signals, a neural\npathway that converges\nin the brain to create\na particular feeling,\nthought, or behavior,\nbut there are also indirect pathways.\nAnd that's what takes us\nback to the gut microbiome\nand to these little microbiota.\nAnd to just give you the takeaway\nmessage at the front here\nand then I'll give you\na little more detail\nas to how it comes about,\nyou have neurotransmitters in your brain\nand in your spinal cord and in your eyes\nand in your peripheral nervous system.\nThey cause the activation\nor the suppression\nof nerve activity,\nmeaning they either electrically\nactivate other nerve cells\nor they cause other nerve cells\nto be less electrically active.\nAnd they do that by way\nof neurotransmitters.\nBut as it turns out,\nthe gut microbiota are capable\nof influencing metabolic events\nand in some cases are capable\nof synthesizing\nneurotransmitters themselves.\nSo what that means is\nthat these little bugs,\nthese little microbiota\nthat are cargo in your gut,\nthe six pounds of cargo,\nthey actually can make neurochemicals\nthat can pass into the bloodstream\nand into your brain and actually impact\nthe other cells of your\nbody and brain indirectly,\nso without involving these\nvery intricate nerve pathways\nthat we've been talking about.\nIn other words, the foods you eat,\nthe environment of your gut microbiome,\ncan actually create\nthe chemical substrates\nthat allow your brain to\nfeel one way or the other,\nto feel great or to feel lousy,\nto seek out more of a\nparticular type of behavior\nor to avoid that behavior.\nAnd that would constitute\nindirect signaling.\nSo I've been talking a lot\nabout the structure and function\nof the gut-to-brain pathway,\nfocusing mainly on feeding behaviors\nand in some cases avoiding\nfeeding or even ejecting food\nfrom the digestive tract,\nI'd like to drill a little bit deeper\ninto this indirect signaling pathway\nfrom the gut to the brain\nbecause it bridges us\nnicely from neuronal signals\nin the gut to the brain,\nhormonal signals from\nthe gut to the brain,\nto what also includes the microbiome,\nwhich is what we started talking about\nat the beginning of the episode.\nAs I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,\ncertain gut microbiota\ncan actually synthesize\ncertain neurotransmitters\nthat can go impact the brain.\nAnd we actually have some\nknowledge about which microbiota\ncan synthesize particular\nneurotransmitters.\nFor instance, the neuromodulator dopamine\ncan be synthesized\nby or from bacillus and serratia.\nNow, these are just names of microbiota.\nI don't expect that any of you\nwould necessarily recognize them.\nThese aren't the sorts of\nthings that you necessarily\nwould run out and buy\nto get more dopamine.\nBut the point is that\nparticular gut microbiota\ncan create dopamine in our gut\nthat can get into our bloodstream\nand can generally change our\nbaseline levels of dopamine\nwithin the brain and\nother areas of the body.\nI mentioned baseline levels of dopamine\nbecause as I talked about on\nan episode all about dopamine\nbut I'll just repeat the basics here now,\nwe have baseline levels\nof transmitters or neuromodulators\nthat act as sort of the level of the tide,\nthe overall level,\nand then we can have peaks of dopamine\nthat are created by behaviors\nor by ingestion of particular\nfoods or drugs, et cetera.\nSo bacillus and serratia tend to increase\nour baseline levels of dopamine.\nSo if it turns out that we are creating\nthe right gut microbiome environment\nthat these particular gut\nmicrobiota can thrive in,\nwell, then our baseline levels\nof dopamine will be elevated\nand in general, that leads\nto enhancement of mood.\nSimilarly, there are other gut microbiota,\nfor instance, candida,\nstreptococus, various enterococcus,\nthese always have these kind of strange\nand not so attractive\nnames, at least to me\nas a neurobiologist.\nNonetheless, those particular microbiota\nsupport the production of\nor can even be metabolized\ninto serotonin, which is a neuromodulator\nassociated with mood,\nwith social interactions,\nwith a huge number of different types\nof events and behaviors.\nAgain, these gut microbiota when present\nand allowed to thrive in our gut\nwill increase our overall\nlevels of serotonin\nand riding on top of\nthat level of serotonin\nwill be the serotonin\nthat's specifically released\nin response to certain behaviors.\nAnd I really want to drive home this point\nof baselines and peaks.\nThe baseline level of serotonin\nmight set our overall mood,\nwhether or not we wake\nup feeling pretty good\nor really lousy if our serotonin levels\nhappen to be very, very low,\nwhether or not we tend to\nbe in a kind of a calm space\nor whether or not we tend\nto be somewhat irritable.\nBut then of course individual\nevents as we go about our day,\nmaybe a compliment that we get\nor maybe somebody says\nsomething irritating to us,\nwhatever it may be will also\ninfluence levels of serotonin,\nbut those serotonin events\nare going to be related\nto events at particular\nneural circuits in the brain.\nAnd this is an important topic\nbecause I think that a lot of\npeople hear quite accurately,\noh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin\nis manufactured in the gut.\nAnd indeed that's true.\nIt's manufactured from\nthe sorts of microbiota\nthat I just described.\nAnd there are many, many experiments now,\nmostly in animal models,\nbut also some in humans that\nshow that if the gut microbiome\nis deficient in some way to\nthese particular bacteria,\nthat serotonin levels drop\nand people's mood suffers,\nmaybe even their immune system functions,\nmaybe even it exacerbates\ncertain psychiatric illnesses.\nHowever, a lot of people take that to mean\nthat the serotonin of the\nbrain all comes from the gut\nor mostly comes from the gut.\nThat's not the case.\nIt's still the case that you\nhave neurons in the brain\nthat are responsible\nfor releasing serotonin\ndirectly in response to certain\nthings like social touch\nor through other types of\npositive social experiences.\nSo we've got gut microbiota\nthat can literally be turned into dopamine\nand raise our baseline levels of dopamine.\nWe've got gut microbiota\nthat can literally raise our\nbaseline levels of serotonin.\nAnd indeed there are other gut\nmicrobiota like lactobacillus\nor bifidobacterium, excuse me,\nhard complex names to pronounce,\nbifidobacterium that can give rise\nto increases in GABA levels,\nthis inhibitory neurotransmitter\nthat can act as a little\nbit of a mild sedative,\ncan reduce irritability, et cetera,\nbut that's just the baseline,\nthe kind of tide of those neuromodulators.\nAgain, I want to emphasize\nthat we still have\nneurocircuits within the brain and body\nthat are specifically\nreleasing in a very potent way\ndopamine, serotonin, and GABA.\nSo the two things act in concert.\nEven though the gut and\nthe brain are acting\nboth in parallel and directly\ninfluencing one another,\nit is a powerful synergistic effect.\nAnd there are now hundreds of studies,\nmaybe even thousands by this point,\nmostly performed in animal models,\ntypically mice, but also\nsome studies in humans\nthat show that creating\nthe correct environment\nfor these gut microbiota to thrive\nreally does enhance mood and wellbeing.\nAnd that when our gut\nmicrobiome is not healthy,\nthat it really can deplete our\nmood and sense of wellbeing.\nNow, there are two major phases\nto creating a healthy gut microbiome.\nOne you can control and the other one\nis less under your control.\nI get into this in a lot of detail\nin the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg,\nwhich is coming out\nimmediately after this one,\nthe following Monday, that is.\nBut for now I want to just\ncapture a few of the main points\nabout the early establishment\nof the gut microbiome.\nIt turns out that the environment\nthat we are exposed to,\nthe things that come into\ncontact with our skin\nand digestive tract and\nany other mucosal lining,\neven the urethra, the nasal passages,\nany opening to the outside world\nthat brings in certain, excuse me,\ncertain microbiota in the\nfirst three years of life\nis going to have a profound impact\non the overall menu of microbiota\nthat we will be able to\ncarry within our body.\nAnd it really does seem\nthat getting exposure to\nand building a diverse microbiome\nin those first three years is critical.\nThere's a lot of speculation and some data\nas to cesarean delivered babies\nhaving less diverse microbiomes\ncompared to vaginally delivered babies.\nThere have been attempts,\nalthough not conclusive attempts,\nto link that to the presence\nof autism spectrum disorders,\nwhich at least by some statistics\nseem to be of higher probability\nin cesarean deliveries\nalthough there are other\nstudies that refute that,\nand I want to make that clear.\nHowever, it's clear that\nbabies do not get much,\nif any, exposure to\nmicrobiota inside of the womb,\nmaybe a little bit, but not much.\nBut that is during the birth process\nand in the days and\nweeks immediately after\nthey arrive in the world\nthat their gut microbiome\nis established, that those gut microbiota\ntake residence within the gut.\nSo it will depend on whether\nor not they were breastfed\nor bottle fed.\nIt'll depend on whether\nor not they were exposed\nto a household pet or not,\nwhether or not they were\nheld by multiple caregivers\nor just by one,\nwhether or not they were a preemie baby\nand were contained in a\nparticularly restrictive environment\nin order to encourage\ntheir further development\nbefore they could be brought home or not.\nI don't want to give the picture\nthat if you were isolated\nor you were delivered by C-section,\nthat you're somehow doomed\nto have a poor microbiome.\nThat's simply not the case.\nHowever, it is the case\nthat the more diversity\nof microbiota that one\ncan create early in life\nis really helpful for long-term outcomes\nin terms of brain-to-gut signaling,\ngut-to-brain signaling,\nand for sake of the immune system.\nThere are some decent studies showing\nthat if children are exposed\nto a lot of antibiotic\ntreatment early in life,\nthat can be very\ndetrimental to establishment\nof a healthy gut microbiome.\nAnd fortunately that reestablishing\na healthy gut microbiome\ncan help rescue some of those deficits.\nSo doctors nowadays are much more cautious\nabout the prescription of\nantibiotic drugs to children\nin their early years, not\njust up to three years,\nbut extending out to five\nand seven and 10 years.\nAnd even in adults, they're\nvery, very careful about that,\nor they ought to be.\nOne reason is the\nexistence, or I would say,\nthe proliferation of\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria\nthat are becoming more common\nin hospitals and elsewhere\nand that can cause serious problems.\nBut in addition to that,\nbecause of this understanding\nthat the gut microbiome\nis influencing and actually\ncreating neurotransmitters\nthat can impact mood and mental health,\nimpact immune health, and so on.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds\nif not thousands of studies\nemphasizing the key role\nof the microbiome on brain health,\npsychiatric health, et cetera.\nI want to just highlight\na few of those studies\nand in particular, some recent\nstudies that come from labs\nthat have been working\non this sort of thing\nfor a very long time.\nOne of the more exciting\nstudies comes from the work\nof Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab,\nwhich is at Baylor College of Medicine.\nMauro's lab has been\nworking on mouse models\nof autism spectrum\ndisorder for a long time,\nand looking at social behavior\nusing a mouse model for a long time.\nAnd they've been able to identify\nparticular types of microbiota\nthat when they take resonance in the gut\ncan help offset some of\nthe symptoms of autism,\nat least the symptoms of autism\nthat exist in these mouse models, okay?\nSo again, this is not human work.\nThis is work being done on mouse models\nfor the simple reason that you can do\nthese kinds of manipulations,\nwhere basically they took mice\nthat were in germ free-environments\nor non-germ-free environments,\nor they exposed mice to\nparticular microbiota\nand not other microbiota\nand they discovered that\na particular microbiota\ncalled L. reuteri,\nit's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I.\nTreatment with L. reuteri\ncorrects the social deficits\npresent in these autism models\nand it does so by way of\nactivating our old friend\nthe vagus nerve,\nbut not simply because the vagus nerve\ntriggers the release of dopamine,\nbut it turns out that this\nparticular gut microbiota\nL. reuteri can correct the social deficits\nin this autism spectrum disorder model.\nIt does that by way of\na vagal nerve pathway\nthat stimulates both dopamine\nrelease and oxytocin release.\nAnd they establish this\nreally mechanistically\nby showing, for instance,\nif you get rid of the oxytocin receptor,\nyou don't see this rescue.\nNow, those are mouse models\nso we have to take those with\nthe appropriate grain of salt,\nbut they're really exciting.\nAnd they come to us in\nparallel with other studies\nthat are being done,\ntaking the microbiomes of people\nwho have one condition\nor lack of condition,\nand putting it into people\nwho have one condition\nor another condition.\nLet me explain what I mean by that.\nThe early discovery of the gut microbiome\nand its potential to impact health\nwas not in the context of\nthe gut-to-brain pathway\nbut rather it was in\nthe context of colitis.\nThis dates back to studies in the '50s,\nwhereby people with very\nsevere intractable colitis\nfor which no other\ntreatment was going to work\nreceived fecal transplants.\nSo yes, that's exactly as it sounds.\nTaking the stool of healthy\npeople who do not have colitis,\ntransplanting those stools\ninto the lower digestive tract\nof people who do have colitis,\nand they saw significant improvement,\nif not rescue of the colitis.\nThat was one of the first indications\nthat something within\nstool, of all things,\ncould actually rescue another\nindividual from disease,\nwhich sounds kind of wild and crazy,\nand may even sound\ndisgusting to some of you,\nbut as I mentioned at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nalmost 60% of stool is\nlive or dead bacteria,\nmicrobiota, and it really\nopened up this entire field\nof exploring how different microbiota\nmight have therapeutic effects.\nAnd indeed, that has\nbeen shown to be the case\nalso in fecal transplants for\ncertain psychiatric illnesses.\nThese are still ongoing studies.\nThey vary in quality.\nThese are hard studies to\ndo for all sorts of reasons,\ngetting the appropriate\npatient populations,\ngetting agreement, et cetera,\nmaking sure that everything's\nhandled properly.\nBut what this involves\nis fecal transplants\nfrom individuals that lack\na particular psychiatric condition\nor metabolic condition into people\nwho have a particular metabolic condition\nand there has been tremendous\nsuccess in some cases.\nOne of the more powerful\nand salient examples\nis for obesity.\nThere's some people for\nwhich even if they ingest\nvery low numbers of calories,\neven if they go on a liquid protein diet,\nsimply can't lose weight.\nThese are somewhat rare disorders\nbut these are people that would\neither get gastric bypass surgery.\nSome people are now getting\nthese fecal transplants\nfrom people that have\nhealthy weight and they\ntake the stool from them,\nthey put it into lower digestive tract,\nand they can see substantial\nimprovement in weight loss\nin people that were\notherwise unable to do that.\nIn some cases, actually\nthey can start eating\nrelatively normal levels of\nfood and still lose weight.\nSo pretty remarkable\nand that tells us there's\nsomething in these microbiota\nthat's really powerful.\nNow, how those effects\nare generated isn't clear.\nOne idea is that it's\nimpacting the metabolome,\ncomponents of the metabolism,\nalmost certainly that's\ngoing to be the case.\nAnother idea is that it's\nimpacting neurotransmitters\nwhich change behavior and\nfood choices within the brain.\nAlthough, as I mentioned,\nsome of these people\nare already eating very\nlittle food to begin with\nso that's a little bit harder\nof an argument to create.\nThere are also some\nsomewhat famous examples now\nof how fecal transplants can\nlead to negative outcomes.\nBut those negative\noutcomes further underscore\nthe power of the microbiome\nin impacting bodily health.\nOne key example of this, for instance,\nis transfer of fecal\nmatter into another person\nin order to treat something like colitis\nand it effectively does that,\nbut if the donor of the\nstool, of the fecal matter\nhappened to be obese or have\nsome other metabolic syndrome,\nit's been observed that the recipient\ncan also develop that metabolic syndrome\nsimply by way of receiving\nthat donor's particular microbiota.\nSo these microbiota can\ncreate positive outcomes\nor they can create negative outcomes.\nNow, most of us of course,\nare not interested in\nor pursuing fecal transplants.\nMost people are interested\nin just creating\na healthy gut microbiome environment\nfor sake of immune system\nand brain function.\nAnd we will talk about how to\ndo that in just a few minutes.\nBut I just want to further underscore\nthe power of the microbiota\nin shaping brain chemistry\nand in shaping things like mood\nor other aspects of mental health\nthat typically we don't\nassociate with our gut.\nThere are several studies\npublished in recent years,\none that I'll just highlight now,\nfirst author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom\nwith Gut Microbial\nDiversity and Composition,\nan Exploratory Study\".\nIt's an interesting study.\nLooked at 184 community\ndwelling adults, excuse me,\nranging from 28 to 97 years old.\nThey explored whether or not\nhaving enhanced microbial diversity\nsomehow related to these variables\nthat they refer to as\nloneliness and wisdom.\nThey used a number of different\ntests to evaluate those.\nThose are common tests in\nthe psychology literature,\nnot so much in the biology literature,\nbut nonetheless, there are\nways of measuring things\nlike loneliness and wisdom,\nwisdom in this case, being\nthe opposite of loneliness,\nat least in the context of this study.\nAnd what they found was the\nmore microbial diversity,\nthe more diverse one's microbiome was,\nthe lower incidence of loneliness.\nAnd they did this by taking fecal samples,\nprofiling them for RNA.\nSo essentially doing gene\nsequencing of the stool\nof these individuals,\ngetting ratings of how lonely\nor not lonely they felt,\nand correlating those.\nAnd that's just but one study.\nI point it out because\nit's particularly recent\nand it looked like it was\nparticularly well done.\nThere is another study that\nI'll just refer you to.\nThis was a study published in\n2020 in \"Scientific Reports\".\nThe title of the study\nis \"Emotional Wellbeing\nand Gut Microbiome\nProfiles by Enterotype\".\nWhat I particularly like about this study\nis that they were able\nto correlate the presence\nof certain microbiota with\nfeelings of subjective wellbeing\nand lack of or presence\nof depressive symptoms.\nThey did high-throughput gene sequencing\nof the microbiomes of individuals.\nSo that meant measuring the microbiota,\nfiguring out which\nmicrobiota were present,\nhow diverse their\nmicrobiome was in general.\nGut microbiome diversity is a good thing.\nAnd then to correlate\nthat with what's called\nthe PANAS score.\nPANAS stands for positive\naffect negative affect schedule.\nThis is a test that my\nlab has used extensively,\nthat other labs to use to\nevaluate mood and wellbeing.\nAnd they defined what were\ncalled three enterotypes,\nthree different categories of people\nthat ate very different diets\nthat tended to fall into\ncategories of having more\nor fewer emotional\nsymptoms that were negative\nor more fewer emotional\nsymptoms that were positive\nand whether or not they tend\nto be more depressed, anxious,\nor have more stress-related\nbehaviors, et cetera.\nAnd what they were able\nto derive from this study\nwas some strong indications\nabout what types of things\nwe should ingest in our diet,\nmaybe even certain things\nthat we should avoid,\nbut certainly the types of\nthings that we should ingest,\nthat can enhance mood and wellbeing\nand can tend to shift people away\nfrom more depressive-like anxiety\nand stress-related symptoms.\nBefore we get into what the\nparticular food items were\nthat lend themselves to\na healthy microbiome,\nI want to raise a bigger and\nperhaps more important issue,\nwhich is what is a healthy microbiome.\nI think if you asked any\nnumber of world experts,\nand I certainly ask\nthis of Dr. Sonnenburg,\nwhat is a healthy microbiome,\nthey're all going to tell you\nit's a microbiome that\nhas a lot of diversity,\nthat includes a lot of\ndifferent types of bacteria.\nAnd that makes sense\nbecause it logically\nwould include the bacteria\nthat produce GABA and\ndopamine and serotonin,\nand that support the immune system,\nand do a number of different things.\nBut is it simply the case that\nadding microbiota diversity\nis always a good thing?\nWell, that doesn't seem to be the case.\nProbiotics and prebiotics,\nboth of which can enhance\nmicrobiotal diversity,\ncan improve mood, digestion,\nimmune system, and so on.\nThat's been established but\nit's mainly been established\nin the context of\npost-antibiotic treatment\nor people that are recovering from illness\nor people that have been very stressed\nor have been dealing with\nall sorts of challenges,\nmental or physical,\nand they are an attempt to\nreplenish the gut microbiome.\nHowever, it's also clear\nthat excessive microbiota\nbrought about by excessive\nintake of probiotics\ncan lead to things like brain fog.\nThere's actually some good\nstudies that point to the fact\nthat certain metabolites\nof the microbiome,\ncertain chemicals produced in the gut\nand in the body can actually\nlead to brain fog states.\nThis is thought to come about\nthrough the lactate pathways\nof the gut that can then impact the brain.\nIf you want to look more into this issue\nof whether or not probiotics\ntaken in excess perhaps\ncan lead to brain fog,\nI'd encourage you to look\nat a particular paper.\nThis is a paper published\nin \"Clinical and Translational\nGastroenterology\".\nAnd the title of the paper\nis \"Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,\na Link Between SIBO Probiotics\nand Metabolic Acidosis\".\nIt was published in 2018.\nWe can provide a link to this study.\nAnd there are several other\nstudies in the references\nthat point to the fact that in some cases,\nexcessive intake of probiotics\nand excessive proliferation\nof gut microbiota can\nactually be problematic.\nI mention this not to confuse you\nbut because it is confusing out there.\nWe all would think that just increasing\nmicrobiotal diversity\nis always a good thing\nbut there are thresholds\nbeyond which excessive\nmicrobiotal diversity\nmight be problematic.\nI think everyone agrees that having\ntoo few microbial species\nliving in us is not a good idea.\nNow, none of that answers the questions\nthat I think everyone\nreally wants answers to,\nwhich are, what should we do,\nwhat should we not do to\nimprove our gut microbiome?\nI mean, clearly we can't time travel back\nto when we were zero to three years old\nand get a dog if we didn't have a dog,\nget breastfed if we weren't breastfed,\nbe delivered vaginally as\nopposed to by C-section\nif we didn't have that opportunity.\nWe just can't time travel and do that.\nAll of us, however, should\nbe seeking to improve\nthe conditions of our gut microbiome\nbecause of the critical\nways in which it impacts\nthe rest of our brain and bodily health.\nSo what should we do,\nwhat shouldn't we do?\nClearly we know that stress\ncan negatively impact\nthe gut microbiome.\nHowever, some forms of\nstress that can quote unquote\nnegatively impact the microbiome\ninclude fasting, long periods of fasts,\nwhich makes sense because a\nlot of microbiota need food\nin order to thrive.\nIn fact, many if not all\nof them do at some point.\nThere are other questions\nsuch as should we eat particular foods\nand how often should we eat those foods?\nWe've all been told that\nfiber is incredibly important\nbecause of the presence\nof prebiotic fiber,\nwhich can essentially feed the microbiome,\nbut is fiber really necessary\nand how necessary is it to\nencourage a healthy microbiome?\nClearly, there are a number of people\nfollowing relatively low fiber diets,\nsuch as ketogenic diets,\nand those can have, in some cases,\nanti-inflammatory\neffects and can sometimes\nalso improve certain microbiota species.\nSo it can all be rather confusing.\nAnd for that matter, I\nasked our resident expert,\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford,\nall of these questions.\nAnd he answers them very systematically\nin the episode that\ncomes out after this one.\nBut I don't want to\nwithhold anything from you\nso I'll just give a\nvery top contour version\nof those answers and then\nyou'll get more in-depth answers\nduring that episode.\nI asked about fasting.\nAnd the reason I asked about\nfasting is that years ago,\nI was at a meeting as part\nof the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting\nand one of the other\nPew Biomedical Scholars\nwas an expert in gut microbiome\nand I said, \"Hey, are probiotics\ngood for the microbiome?\nAnd if so, which ones should I take?\"\nAnd his answer was very interesting.\nHe said, \"You know, in\ncertain cases they can be,\nespecially if you're\ntraveling or you're stressed,\nbut it turns out that\nthe particular bacteria\nthat they put in most probiotics\ndon't actually replenish the\nmicrobiota that you need most.\"\nAnd I thought, \"Oh, well,\nwhy don't they make ones\nthat replenish the microbiota\nthat you need most?\"\nAnd his answer was, \"Well,\nthey don't replenish those\nbut they replenish other ones\nthat then in turn\nencourage the development\nof the microbiota that you do want\nonce you start eating\nthe appropriate foods.\nSo they change the environment\nwhich makes the environment better,\nwhich indirectly supports\nthe proliferation\nof quote unquote good microbiota.\"\nOkay, so that was a\nsomewhat convoluted answer\nbut I did appreciate his answer.\nThen I asked him about fasting.\nI said, \"Well, a lot of\npeople are getting interested\nin intermittent fasting now.\nPeople are spending a significant portion\nof each 24-hour cycle avoiding food\nfor sake of time restrictive feeding.\nWhat does that do to the gut microbiome?\nDoes it make it healthier or\ndoes it make it unhealthier?\"\nWell, my colleague from\nYale and Dr. Sonnenburg\nboth confirmed that\nduring periods of fasting,\nespecially prolonged periods of fasting,\nwe actually start to digest away\nmuch of our digestive tract.\nNow, the whole thing\ndoesn't start to disappear\nbut there's thinning of the mucosal lining\nor the least disruption\nof the mucosal lining.\nA lot of the microbiota\nspecies can start to die off.\nAnd so it was surprising to\nme, but nonetheless interesting\nthat fasting may actually\ncause a disruption\nto certain healthy elements\nof the gut microbiome.\nBut again, there's a caveat.\nThe caveat is that when people\neat after a period of fast,\nthere may be a compensatory proliferation,\nmeaning an increase in\nhealthy gut microbiota.\nSo you start to get the picture\nthat fasting is neither good nor bad.\nYou start to get the picture\nthat particular diets,\nmeaning certain restriction diets\nor macronutrient-rich diets\nmay not be good or bad\nfor the microbiome.\nAnd yet there are some\nanswers that arrive to us\nfrom Dr. Sonnenburg, but from\nother experts in the field,\nthat there are certain foods\nand certain things that we can ingest\nwhich definitely enhance the microbiome\nand make it healthier than it would be\nwere we to not ingest those foods.\nSo next I'd like to\ntalk about what I think\nis a really pioneering and\nimportant study in this area.\nThis is a study that was carried\nout by the Sonnenburg lab\nin collaboration with Chris\nGardner's lab, also at Stanford,\nwhere they compared two general\ntypes of diets in humans,\ndiets that were fiber rich,\nwhich has been proposed\ntime and time again\nto enhance microbiota diversity\nand to enhance gut-brain signaling even\nand to enhance the immune system perhaps,\nand diets that were enriched\nin so-called low-sugar fermented foods.\nBefore I dive into that study\nand what the conclusions were\nbecause they are very interesting\nand very actionable for all of us,\nI do want to touch on probiotics\nbecause I want to avoid confusion.\nIt is not the case that\ningestion of probiotics\nwill always lead to brain fog.\nI want to make that clear.\nIt is the case that\ningestion of probiotics,\neven if those probiotics\ndon't directly contain\nthe microbiota species that\none is trying to proliferate,\ncan be useful for improving\nmicrobiotal diversity.\nIn general, it seems that maintaining\na healthy gut microbiome\ninvolves ingesting certain types of foods,\nand we'll talk about those in a moment,\nbut perhaps also augmenting\nthe microbiota system\nthrough prebiotics or\nprobiotics at a fairly low level\non a consistent basis.\nSo these are not high dose probiotics\nexcept under conditions of dysbiosis\nwhere, for instance, if somebody has done\na round of antibiotics\nand they need to replenish\ntheir gut microbiome,\nthere are foods and there are pill form\nand powder form prebiotics and probiotics\nthat can be very useful.\nOr in cases where people\nhave been very stressed\nor are undergoing excessive travel\nor have shifted their diet radically,\nmaybe that's due to travel,\nmaybe that's due to illness,\nmaybe that's due to stress.\nBut when there are a number\nof different converging events\nthat are stressing or depleting\nmicrobiotal diversity,\nthat's when at least I\nbelieve it can be useful\nto support the gut microbiome\nthrough the ingestion of quality\nprobiotics or prebiotics.\nSo it would be under conditions\nwhere people are stressed\nor their system is generally stressed\nfor environmental or\nillness-related reasons\nthat it might be useful to\nlean towards higher doses\nof prebiotics or probiotics\nthan one might normally use\nbut that under normal conditions,\nthat one would focus on quality nutrients\nthrough diet and focus on\ningestion of probiotics\nat a fairly low to moderate level,\nand/or prebiotics at a\nfairly low to moderate level.\nThat just seems like the logical approach\nbased on the experts that I've spoken to.\nBut certainly if your doctor prescribes\nor suggests that you take\nhigh levels of probiotics\nfor any reason,\nyou should definitely pay\nattention to your physician,\nand you should obviously pay\nattention to your physician\nin any a case.\nYou should never add or remove anything\nfrom your nutritional plan\nor supplementation plan\nwithout consulting a physician.\nSo what should we do in\norder to maximize the health\nof our gut-brain axis as it's called?\nHow should we support the\ndiversity of the good microbiota\nthat help us create all\nthese neurotransmitters\nthat we want, improve our\nimmune system function,\nand so on and so forth?\nWell, some of that is going\nto be through the basics.\nWhen I say the basics,\nI mean the foundational\nthings that really set us up\nfor overall health.\nSo this is going to be getting deep sleep\nof sufficient duration 80\nplus percent of the time.\nI mean, if you could get a\nhundred percent of the time,\nthat'd be great but very\nfew people accomplish that.\nIt's going to be proper hydration.\nIt's going to be proper\nsocial interactions.\nIt's going to be proper nutrition.\nAnd we'll talk more about\nnutrition in a moment.\nIt's going to be limiting\nexcessive, prolonged stressors or stress.\nAnd indeed we've done episodes about,\njust about all of those things\nbut certainly about stress\nwe have an episode of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nthat you can find at hubermanlab.com\nall about mastering stress,\nhow to avoid long periods\nof intense stress,\nwhat to do to offset those.\nGiven that stress can\ndisrupt the microbiome,\nwhether or not you're fasting or not,\nthose tools ought to be useful.\nNow, in what I consider\nto be a landmark study\nexploring the relationship\nbetween the gut microbiome,\nfood intake, and overall\nhealth is this paper\nfrom Justin Sonnenburg's\nlab and Chris Gardner's lab,\nboth of which are at Stanford.\nAnd the paper entitled \"Gut\nMicrobiome-Targeted Diets\nModulate Human Immune Status\"\nwas published in the journal \"Cell\",\nwhich is among the three top\njournals perhaps in the world,\n\"Nature\", \"Science\", and \"Cell\"\nreally being the apex\njournals for overall science,\nand especially for biomedical sciences.\nNow, this is a very interesting study.\nIt was done on humans.\nThere were two major groups.\nOne group of humans was\ninstructed to increase\nthe amount of fiber in their diet\nand in fact ate a high fiber diet.\nThe other group was instructed to eat\na high fermented food diet.\nNow, both groups started\noff not having eaten\na lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods\nand were told to increase\nthe amount of either fiber\nor fermented foods that\nthey were ingesting\nover a four-week ramp up period\nand that was to avoid any\nmajor gastric distress.\nIt turns out that if you're\nnot already accustomed\nto eating a lot of fiber,\nincreasing your amount\nof fiber dramatically\ncan cause some gastric distress\nbut if you ease into it\nover time, as we'll see,\nthere's a mechanism behind this,\nwhich was unveiled in this study,\nbut if you ease into it over time,\nthen the system can tolerate it.\nLikewise high fermented foods\ncan be readily tolerated\nif there's a ramp up phase of ingesting\nmaybe one serving a day,\nthen maybe two servings,\nand ramping up in this case\nas high as six servings per day.\nHowever, after this ramp up period,\nthe group assigned to\nthe high fiber condition\nmaintained high fiber intake for six weeks\nand the high fermented\nfood group maintained\nhigh fermented food intake for six weeks\nafter which they went off\neither the high fiber or\nthe high fermented food diet\nand there was a four-week follow up period\nduring which they gradually\nreturned to baseline.\nThroughout the study their\ngut microbiome was evaluated\nfor the diversity of gut microbiota.\nAnd there were also a number of measures\nof immune system function,\nin particular measures of\nthe so-called inflammatome.\nThe immune system has a lot of\ndifferent molecules involved.\nI did a whole episode\nabout the immune system\nif you're interested in learning\nwhat some of those molecules are,\nvarious cytokines and signaling molecules\nthat reflect either\nhigh inflammation states\nor reduced inflammation\nstates in the brain and body.\nYou're welcome to check that episode.\nIt's also at hubermanlab.com.\nRegardless, in this study,\nthey explored the sorts of immune markers\nthat were expressed in\neither of the two groups\nand compared those.\nThe basic takeaway of this paper\nwas that contrary to what they predicted,\nthe high fiber diet did not lead\nto increased microbiota diversity,\nat least not in all cases.\nAnd that was somewhat surprising.\nYou know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber\nand a lot of the material\nin fruits and vegetables\nand grains and so forth\nare supposed to support\nmicrobiotal diversity\nand the proliferation\nof existing microbiota.\nAnd that is not what they observed,\nalthough I want to be\nvery clear in pointing out\nthat the results do\nnot indicate that fiber\nis not useful for health overall,\nbut it does point to the fact\nthat increasing fiber intake\ndid not increase microbiota diversity,\nwhich in general, as I mentioned before,\nis associated with improvements\nin microbiota function,\nhealth, and overall wellbeing.\nNow, the high fermented\nfood diet condition\nwas very interesting.\nIt resulted in increased\nmicrobiome diversity\nand decrease inflammatory\nsignals and activity.\nSo there was a twofer.\nBasically by ingesting\nhigh fermented foods\nin fair abundance, right?\nYou know, four to six\nservings or more per day\nis a lot of fermented food intake.\nWe'll talk about what\nsome of those foods were.\nBut the outcome was very positive.\nThere was a clear increase\nin microbiome diversity\nand decreased inflammatory signals.\nSo things like interleukin-6,\na number of other\ninterleukins and cytokines\nthat are associated with\nincreased inflammation\nin the brain and body were\nreduced significantly.\nNow, let's talk a little\nbit about this notion\nof number of servings, et cetera.\nOne somewhat minor point of the study,\nbut I think is useful in terms\nof taking an actionable stance with this\nis that the number of\nservings of fermented foods\nwas not as strong a\npredictor of improvements\nin the inflammatome,\nmeaning reduced inflammation\nand improvements in microbiota diversity,\nas was the duration of\ntime that the individuals\nwere ingesting fermented foods.\nIn other words, the longer that one\nis consistently ingesting\nfermented foods on a daily basis,\nthe better the outcomes in\nterms of the gut microbiome\nand for reducing inflammation.\nSo I think that's an important point.\nAnd I make that point,\nespecially because for a lot of people,\neven if you do this ramp up phase,\nsix servings per day of fermented foods\ncan seem like quite a lot.\nSo what are these fermented foods?\nI think many of us are\nfamiliar with certain cheeses\nand being fermented and\nbeer being fermented\nand kombucha is fermented.\nIn this study, they focus specifically\non low-sugar fermented foods.\nSo this would be plain yogurt,\nin some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.\nAn important consideration, however,\nis that it needs to contain\nwhat are called live active cultures,\nwhich means there actually\nhave to be microbiota\nthat are alive inside the sauerkraut.\nOne way you know whether\nor not that's happening\nis if you purchase sauerkraut\nor pickles or kimchi\nfrom a jar or a container\nthat's on the non-refrigerated shelf\nor the non-refrigerated\nsection of your grocery store,\nit is not going to contain\nlive active cultures of microbiota.\nAnd likewise, if you consume yogurt\nthat has a lot of sugar or\nother components added to it,\nit's not going to have\nthe same positive effect\non the microbiome,\nat least that's the prediction\ngiven some of the relationship\nbetween the sorts of\nmicrobiota that live in sugar\nversus plain type yogurts.\nThey gave people the option of consuming\nany number of different\nlow-sugar fermented food.\nSo that again that could\nbe sauerkraut, kimchi,\nthings like kefir, natto.\nIn Japan, they consume natto\nwhich is a fermented food.\nBeer was not one of the fermented foods\nthat was included in\nthe fermented food list.\nAnd when we say six servings per day,\nthat is indeed six, six ounce servings,\nor six, four to six ounce servings.\nIt was not six servings of\nwhat's listed on the package.\nSo again, that turns\nout to be a fair amount\nof fermented foods.\nHow should you gauge\nwhether or not you're\ngetting enough of this?\nWell, if you decide to\ntake on this protocol\nof ingesting more fermented foods,\nwhich at least by my read of this study\nand some of the follow up\nwork that's being done,\nsounds like a terrific idea\nif you want to improve your gut microbiome\nfor all the great reasons\nthat one would want to,\nbrain-body health, reduced\ninflammation, and on and on,\nwell then you definitely want to focus\non fermented foods that\nyou enjoy consuming.\nSo for you if that's kefir,\nor for you that's plain yogurt,\nor for you that's sauerkraut,\nwhich happens to be my personal favorite,\nthen you want to make sure\nthat it's going to be something\nthat you are going to enjoy\ningesting quite a lot of\nand that you're going to\nbe okay with ingesting\nprobably throughout the day.\nNow, people follow different\nmeal schedules, of course,\nbut this does require not just eating\nall the fermented foods just\nbefore bedtime or at one meal.\nI suppose you could do that,\nbut in general, it's going\nto work best in terms\nof limiting gastric distress\nby spreading it out throughout the day.\nI also want to mention brine.\nBrine is the liquid that\nsurrounds sauerkraut.\nIt's that very salty fluid.\nAnd that contains a lot\nof active live cultures.\nAnd they did include or they\nallowed people to include\nbrine in this study.\nAnd in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg,\nwhich we'll go into in\nmore detail on the episode\nthat comes out next week,\nwe talk a lot about the particular value\nthat brine might hold\nin terms of bringing\nabout microbiota diversity\nbecause of the richness of\nlive cultures that it contains.\nI do want to focus for a moment\non the high fiber condition\nbecause there were some\ninteresting observations\nabout the people that were\nplaced into that condition.\nFirst of all, increasing\nthe amount of fiber\ndefinitely increased the number of enzymes\nthat can be used to digest fiber.\nThis is in keeping with this\nidea of this ramp up phase\nwhere accumulation of more fiber intake\ncan over time lead to\nless gastric distress\nbut also to more utilization of fiber\nwhich overall should be a good thing.\nSo while they didn't observe an increase\nin immune system function\nor an increase in microbiota diversity,\nthere was an increase in\nthese fiber digesting enzymes.\nThey also observed what they called\npersonalized immune responses.\nThere were some subgroups\nwithin the high fiber group\nthat had interesting changes in terms\nof their reactions to, or I\nshould say their inflammatome,\nmeaning the inflammatory\nmarkers they expressed,\nas well as their microbiota diversity.\nSo there were essentially three groups.\nOne group actually showed an increase\nin inflammatory markers.\nSo that was quite surprising\nand probably not wonderful for the message\nthat fiber is always good for us\nbut that was a small cohort\nwithin the fiber intake group.\nAnother group and still another group,\nboth showed reductions in\nbaseline microbiota diversity\nalthough to varying degrees.\nSo I don't want to paint the\npicture that fiber is bad\nbut fiber certainly did not\nhave the positive effects\non microbiota diversity\nthat the high fermented food diet did.\nSo my read of this study,\nand I think the stance\nthat many others have taken\nas a consequence of these data,\nis that we should be increasing\nour fermented food intake,\nthat that's simply a good\nthing to do in order to support\nour gut microbiome and to\nreduce inflammatory signals\nin our brain and body.\nAnd there are a number of\ndifferent ways to do that.\nI mentioned some of the particular foods.\nHowever, anytime you're talking\nabout ingesting fermented foods,\nespecially the high quality ones\nthat come from the refrigerated section\nof the grocery store,\nand that have low sugar\ncontent, et cetera,\nwe do have to be considerate of cost\nbecause certain things like\nkombuchas, for instance,\ncan be quite costly.\nI should also mention some kombuchas\nactually contain alcohol, some do not,\nor contain very little amounts of alcohol.\nOne way to avoid the high\ncost of fermented foods\nwhile still being able to accumulate\na lot of fermented food intake\nis to simply make those\nfermented foods yourself.\nAnd this is something that\nwe've started exploring\nand experimenting with in our home.\nOne simple way to do this\nis to just make your own sauerkraut.\nIt involves very few ingredients.\nIt basically involves\ncabbage, water, and salt,\nbut there's a specific process\nthat you need to follow\nin order to create these large\nvolumes of sauerkraut at home\nusing that low cost method.\nThe best resource that I know of\nin order to follow a great recipe\nto make homemade sauerkraut\nwould be the recipe\nfor homemade sauerkraut that's contained\nin Tim Ferriss's book, \"The 4-Hour Chef\".\nThere's an excellent protocol there.\nIt involves chopping up the\ncabbage, putting into a bowl,\nmashing it up with your hands,\nwhich can be fun,\nputting water in there,\nsome salt, covering it,\nand then keeping it in a\nparticular environment,\nand then routinely scraping off\nsome of the material from the surface.\nYou have to do that in order to make sure\nthat you're not getting\nmicrobes and things\ngrowing in it that are bad for you.\nSo you definitely want\nto pay careful attention\nto the protocol, but that's\na very, very low cost way\nof generating lots and\nlots of fermented foods\nso you don't go broke trying\nto improve your microbiome.\nThe other thing that you can do\nif you're really obsessed with kombucha\nor something like that, to\navoid the high cost of kombucha\nis there are ways that\nyou can get the scoby,\nwhich basically allows you to make\nyour own kombucha at home.\nI've never tried this,\nbut when I was a post doc,\nthere was an undergraduate in the lab,\nI think, well, I won't out him,\nbut he's now gone on to medical school\nand I think he's passed his residency\nand is a practicing doctor,\nbut nonetheless, he was always\nmaking kombucha at home.\nHe told me it was exceedingly\neasy, but then again,\nhe had a number of other\nskills and attributes\nthat made me think that he could do\npretty much anything with ease,\nwhereas I tend to struggle\nwith even basic cooking.\nSo maybe if you're feeling\na little more adventurous,\nyou could explore making\nyour own kombucha.\nBut there are a number of\ndifferent protocols and recipes\nout there for making your own\nlow-sugar fermented foods.\nSo you needn't run out\nand buy fresh sauerkraut\nall the time.\nI should also mention for those\nof you that are interested\nin getting your fermented\nintake from pickles,\njarred pickles rarely\nif ever contain ferment.\nMostly they're just\nsoaked in vinegar, water,\nand with some spices,\nbut there are some that contain ferment.\nYou actually have to look\nfor that on the container.\nAnd I don't know, maybe someone out there\nknows how to make natto and\nknows how to make kimchi well\nand things of that sort.\nIt certainly is the case based\non the data from the study\nthat ingesting more servings\nof fermented food per day\nought to be beneficial\nfor our gut microbiome.\nAnd since this is an episode\nnot just about gut microbiome\nbut gut-brain health,\nI should mention that\none form of signaling\nbetween the gut microbiome and the brain\nwhich we did not discuss\nand I'll just touch on briefly\nis that when the inflammatome\nor the genes and markers\nof inflammation are\nkept in a healthy range,\nthere's an active signaling\nof that immune system status\nto the brain.\nThere's an intermediate\ncell type that communicates\nimmune status to the brain.\nAnd that cell type is the microglial cell.\nIt's a type of glia as the name suggests.\nWhen there's a lot of\ninflammation in the body,\nthese microglia actually get activated\nand can start eating away\nat various components\nof the brain and nervous system.\nAnd I don't mean massive eating away.\nThey're not going to\ndigest the whole brain\nbut these microglia are sort\nof the resident macrophages\nof the brain.\nMacrophages are in the periphery\nand they gobble up debris\nand things of that sort.\nThe microglia on a regular\nbasis are eating up debris\nthat accumulates across waking cycles\nand in response to\nmicro-damage to the brain\nthat occurs on a daily basis.\nSo they have a lot of\nimportant basic everyday\nwhat we call housekeeping functions.\nBut when there's a lot of\ninflammation in the body,\nwhen there's a massive immune response,\nthe microglia can be hyperactivated\nand that's thought to lead to any number\nof different cognitive defects\nor challenges thinking,\nor maybe even some forms of\nneurodegeneration over time,\nalthough that last point\nis more of a hypothesis\nthan a well tamped down\nfact at this point.\nThere's still a lot of\ninvestigation to be done in humans.\nThe animal data, however,\nare very, very strong\nthat when the immune system is activated\nor chronically activated or hyperactivated\nthat neural tissue, meaning brain tissue\nand other central nervous\nsystem tissue can suffer.\nSo there are a lot of reasons to want\nto not just improve microbiome diversity,\nbut to also improve immune system function\nand to limit the number\nof inflammatory markers\nthat are present in the body\nbecause of the way those\ninflammatory markers\ncan signal deleterious\nevents in the brain.\nAnd while eating fermented foods\nand making your own fermented foods\nand buying high quality fermented foods\nmight seem like an inconvenience,\nI would say that from the perspective\nof cost-benefit or effort-benefit,\nit's actually quite a good situation\nwhere if you can just ramp up\nthe number of fermented foods\nor servings of fermented foods\nthat you're eating per day\nover a period of a few weeks\nso that you're tolerating that well,\nthat ought to have a very positive effect\non your microbiome diversity\nand indeed on gut-brain function.\nAnd I'll be the last to suggest\nthat people completely forego on fiber.\nI think there's some debate out there\nas to how much fiber we\nneed and whether or not\ncertain forms of fiber\nare better than others.\nI'm not going to get into that debate.\nIt's barbed wire enough without\nme injecting my own views\ninto that debate.\nBut I think there's ample\nevidence to support the fact\nthat for most people ingesting\na fair amount of fiber\nis going to be a good idea.\nI would just say that\nmake sure that you're also\ningesting a fair amount\nof fermented foods.\nAnd along the lines of fiber,\nin an accompanying article\npublished in \"Cell\",\nwhich was sort of a what we\ncall a news and views piece\nabout the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper,\nthey make a quite good point,\nwhich is that the increase in fiber intake\nthat led to the increase in\ncarbohydrate active enzymes,\nthese CAZymes as they're called,\nthese are enzymes that help digest fiber,\nquote, \"indicating an enhanced\ncapacity for the microbiome\nto degrade complex carbohydrates\npresent in fibrous foods\".\nSo in other words, eating\nmore fiber and fibrous foods\nallowed for an increase in these enzymes\nthat allow you to eat\nstill more fibrous foods\nor to better digest fibrous\nfoods that are coming in\nthrough other sources.\nSo there is at least one\nutility for increasing fiber\neven though it's separate from\nthe gut microbiotal diversity\nand reducing inflammation.\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't\ntouch on some of the data\nand controversy about\nartificial sweeteners\nand the gut microbiome.\nI want to be very clear that\nwhat I'm about to tell you\nhas only been established\nin animal models,\nin a mouse model, at\nleast to my knowledge.\nWhat the studies have shown,\nand there were several,\nbut one published in the journal \"Nature\"\na few years back is the one\nthat got the most amount of attention\nis that animals that consume large amounts\nof artificial sweeteners.\nin particular things like\nsaccharin or sucralose\nshow disruptions in their gut microbiome.\nI'm not aware of any studies in humans\nthat show the equivalent effect.\nAnd I'm not aware of any\nstudies in humans that show\nthe equivalent effect for things\nlike plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners,\nthings like Stevia, monk\nfruit, and things of that sort.\nAnd at least by my exploration,\nI couldn't find any data specifically\nrelated to the sweetener aspartame.\nSo right now it's somewhat controversial\nand actually this is kind of\na third rail topic out there.\nWhen one group will come out saying\nthat artificial sweeteners are bad\nbecause they disrupt the gut microbiome,\nthe response generally from\na number of people as well,\nthat's only been shown in animal models.\nAnd indeed that's true.\nSo right now I don't think\nthat there's a strong case\none way or the other.\nI think that people should\nbasically ask themselves\nwhether or not they like\nartificial sweeteners or not,\nwhether or not they're\nwilling to risk it or not,\nand obviously that's an individual choice.\nI also want to point out a recent study\nfrom Diego Bohorquez's lab,\nwhich actually shows, however,\nthat neurons in the gut,\nthose neuropod cells, are\nactually capable of distinguishing\nbetween real sugars and\nartificial sweeteners.\nThis is a really interesting body of work.\nIt was published just now, just recently,\nI should say, February 2022.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"The Preference for Sugar\nover Sweetener Depends\non a Gut Sensor Cell\".\nAnd to make a long story short,\nwhat they showed was there's\na category of neuropod cells\nthat recognize sugar in the\ngut and signal that information\nabout the presence of sugar\nin the gut to the brain\nvia the pathways we talked about before,\nthe nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine,\net cetera, et cetera.\nInterestingly, the very\nsame category of neurons\ncan respond to artificial sweeteners\nand signal that information to the brain,\nbut the pattern of signaling\nand indeed the signature pattern\nthat is conveyed to the brain\nand received by the brain\nis actually quite a bit different\nwhen these same neurons are responding\nto artificial sweeteners\nversus actual sugar.\nAnd this is very interesting\nbecause what it means\nis first of all that neurons\nhave incredible specificity\nin terms of what they are\nsignaling from the gut\nto the brain.\nAnd it also means that there\nmay be a particular signal\nthat the brain receives that says\nI'm receiving some intake of food or drink\nthat tastes sweet but doesn't\nactually offer much nutrients\nin the direction of sweetness,\nmeaning that it doesn't have\ncalories despite being sweet.\nNow, again, this is all\nsubconscious processing.\nAnd like with the previous studies\nwe were just discussing\nabout artificial sweeteners\ngenerally and the gut\nmicrobiome generally,\nit's unclear how this relates to humans\nat this point in time.\nBut given the similarity\nof cellular processes\nand molecular processes at the\nlevel of gut-brain in mice,\nI think it stands to reason\nthat these neuropod cells\nvery likely are capable of\nsignaling sweet presence\nof real sweetener versus\nartificial sweetener\nin humans as well,\nalthough that still remains\nto be determined empirically.\nSo I'd like to just briefly\nrecap what I've covered today.\nI started off by talking about\nthe structure and function\nof the gut-brain axis.\nI described the basic\nstructure and function\nof the digestive pathway,\nand how that digestive pathway\nharbors microbiotal species,\nmeaning many, many little\nbacteria that can signal\nall sorts of things to the\nrest of the brain and body.\nAnd indeed, we talked about\nthe various ways they do that.\nWe talked about direct pathways,\nliterally nerve networks\nthat extend from the gut\nup to the brain and from\nthe brain back to the gut.\nAnd we talked about indirect pathways,\nhow some of the gut microbiota\ncan actually synthesize\nneurotransmitters that get\nout into the bloodstream,\ncan impact the body,\ncan impact the immune system,\nand can get into the brain\nand act as neurotransmitters\nin the brain just as\nwould neurotransmitters\nthat originate from within the brain.\nWe also talked about what constitutes\na healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.\nAnd it's very clear that\nhaving a diverse microbiome\nis healthier than having\na non-diverse microbiome.\nBut as I pointed out,\nthere's still a lot of\nquestions as to exactly\nwhat microbiota species\nyou want to enhance\nand which ones you want\nto suppress in the gut\nin order to achieve the best\ngut-brain axis function.\nWe talked about how things\nlike fasting might impact\nthe microbiome and how\nsome of that might be\na little bit counterintuitive\nbased on some of the other\npositive effects of fasting,\nor if we're not just discussing fasting,\nsome other types of\nsomewhat restrictive diets\neither restrictive in time or restrictive\nin terms of macronutrient intake,\nhow those may or may\nnot improve the health\nof gut microbiome.\nAnd the basic takeaway was\nthat because we don't know\nexactly how specific diets\nimpact the gut microbiome,\nand we don't know how fasting\neither promotes or\ndegrades the microbiome,\nwe really can't say whether\nor not they are improving\nor degrading the microbiome at this time.\nHowever, it is clear that stress,\nin particular chronic stress,\ncan disrupt the gut microbiome.\nIt's also clear, of course,\nthat antibiotics can\ndisrupt the gut microbiome.\nAnd that brings us to the topic\nof prebiotics and probiotics.\nAnd I emphasized the fact\nthat for most people,\ningesting high quality non-processed foods\nthat includes some prebiotic fiber\nbut also that includes some probiotics\nwill probably be healthy\nbut not excessive levels of probiotics.\nHigh levels of supplemented probiotics\nof the sort that would\ncome in a probiotic pill\nor even prescription probiotics\nwould probably lend\nthemselves best to when people\nwere under severe chronic stress\nor had just come off a serious round\nor an ongoing or repeated\nrounds of antibiotics.\nThat does not mean that\ningesting probiotics\nin any form or any kind is not good.\nIt just means that the\nvery high dose probiotics,\nagain, typically found\nin prescription form\nor capsule pill form\nprobably are best reserved\nto cases where of course\nyour doctor prescribes them.\nYou should always follow\nyour doctor's advice.\nBut in cases where\nperhaps you are jetlagged,\nyou're traveling\nexcessively for any reason,\nor working excessively,\nyou're not getting enough sleep,\nor your diet is radically\nchanged from normal.\nAnd we talked about how\nincreasing the amount of fiber\nin your diet might be\nuseful for increasing\nfiber digesting enzymes\nand the assimilation\nof fibrous foods\nbut that it's really the\ningestion of fermented foods\nand, in fact, getting anywhere from four\nor even up to six servings\na day of fermented foods\ncan be immensely beneficial for reducing\ninflammatory markers in the body\nand for improving microbiota diversity\nall along the gut and\nthereby improving signaling\nand outcomes along the gut-brain axis.\nSo we went all the way\nfrom structure to function\nto the four kinds of signaling,\nmechanical, chemical, indirect, direct,\nprobiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.\nAnd I tossed in a little\nbit at the end there also\nabout ways that you can make\nyour own fermented foods\nat home in order to try and\noffset some of the costs.\nAlso, it's just kind of fun to do.\nAnd some of those\nactually taste quite good.\nI've actually found that\nthe fermented sauerkraut\nthat we're making at home actually rivals\nthe sauerkraut that you can buy\nout of the refrigerated\nsection at the grocery store.\nAnd I am by no means\na skilled cook or chef\nand basically have no\nculinary skill whatsoever.\nSo if I can do it, you can do it.\nI hope you found this information useful\nand perhaps also actionable.\nOne of my motivations\nfor doing this episode\nwas, again, as a primer for the episode\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg\nwhere we go really deep\ninto the gut microbiome,\nless so into the gut-brain axis,\nbut really deep into the gut microbiome,\nwhat it is, what it\ndoes, what it doesn't do,\nand some of the emerging\nfindings from his lab\nthat are yet to be published.\nAnd I also was excited to do this episode\nbecause I think many of us have heard\nabout the gut microbiome.\nWe hear about these bacteria\nthat live in our gut.\nWe hear about the gut-brain axis\nor that 90% or more of\nthe serotonin that we make\nis made in our gut.\nWe hear about the gut as a\nsecond brain and so forth.\nBut I think for many people,\nthey don't really have a clear picture\nof what the gut microbiome is\nand the pathways and mechanisms\nby which it can signal\nto the brain and to the\nother parts of the body.\nSo I hope that today's\ninformation at least improved\nthe clarity around that topic\nand leaves you with a more vivid picture\nof this incredible system\nthat is our gut-brain axis.\nIf you're enjoying and/or\nlearning from this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific,\nzero-cost
