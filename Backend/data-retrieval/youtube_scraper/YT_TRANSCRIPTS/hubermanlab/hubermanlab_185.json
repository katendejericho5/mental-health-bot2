    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\n[upbeat music]\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology,\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. David Spiegel.\nDr. Spiegel is the associate\nchair of psychiatry,\nand behavioral neurosciences,\nat Stanford University School of Medicine.\nHe is also the director,\nof the Stanford Center\non Stress and Health.\nDr. Spiegel is both a\nresearcher and a clinician,\nmeaning he runs a laboratory\nthat studies the brain,\nand the body.\nAnd neural mechanisms of how\nthe brain and body interact.\nAnd he sees patients as a\npsychiatrist at Stanford.\nHis work is incredibly unique,\nin that it bridges mind and body,\nbut it also has a particular focus\non the clinical applications of hypnosis.\nAs you'll learn today,\nhypnosis is a unique brain state,\nin which neuroplasticity,\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience,\nmay be heightened and indeed\nthe use of clinical hypnosis,\nby Dr. Spiegel and\ncolleagues has been shown\nto improve symptoms of stress,\nchronic anxiety, chronic pain\nand various other illnesses,\nincluding many psychiatric illnesses\nand even outcomes in cancer.\nToday, we discuss hypnosis in\nthe context of what's called,\nself-hypnosis to distinguish\nit from stage hypnosis.\nMany of you are probably\nfamiliar with stage hypnosis,\nwhich is really about a\nhypnotist getting a person\nto do things they would not otherwise do,\nin contrast, clinical hypnosis,\nand the use of hypnosis for the treatment\nof various ailments of mind\nand body is vastly different.\nIt involves getting people\nto change their brain state\nand to use that brain state as a portal\nto make adjustments in\ntheir brain and body,\nand other aspects of their\nbiology and psychology\nthat benefit them.\nAnd it's been shown over and over again,\nin studies by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues\nthat those changes can\noccur extremely quickly.\nNow, not everybody can be\nhypnotized as readily as the next.\nAnd so today we also\ndiscuss a simple test,\ndeveloped by Dr. Spiegel.\nThe it can help you determine,\nwhether or not you have a\nhigh, medium or low degree,\nof what we call hypnotizability.\nDr. Spiegel is truly\nan expert in this area.\nHe has published over\n480 journal articles,\n170 book chapters on hypnosis,\nand on things like psychosocial oncology,\nwhich is the interaction of mind and body\nin the treatment of cancer\nand cancer outcomes,\non stress physiology, trauma\nand other aspects of psychotherapy.\nHe's published 13 books.\nSo, he's truly the world expert\nin hypnosis and clinical\napplications of hypnosis\nfor mind and body.\nI'm certain that in\nlistening to today's episode,\nyou're going to learn a tremendous amount\nabout how the brain and body interact,\nabout various treatments\nfor all sorts of common\nailments of mind and body.\nAnd you are going to get access to tools,\nin particular, a tool that\nwas developed by Dr. Spiegel,\nwhich is the Reveri app, R-E-V-E-R-I,\nthe Reveri app is currently\nonly available for Apple,\nbut will soon also be\navailable for Android.\nIt does carry a nominal cost,\nbut there is a seven day free trial.\nIf you'd like to try it,\nwe're providing a link in the show notes.\nThe Reveri app is special,\nin that it is based on clinical studies\nand research done in the\nSpiegel lab at Stanford.\nSo, unlike a lot of\nhypnosis apps out there\nand resources for hypnosis,\nit was developed with\nclinical treatments in mind.\nToday, we also discuss\nthe use of breathwork\nand I'm very fortunate that\nmy research lab at Stanford,\nhas been collaborating very\nclosely with Dr. Spiegel\nin testing and developing\nspecific breathwork protocols\nto adjust mind and body\nfor things like anxiety,\nimproving mood and improving sleep.\nBased on his incredible\nand unique expertise,\nand the clarity with which,\nDr. Spiegel communicates information.\nI anticipate that you will\nreally enjoy today's episode\nand that you'll come away from it,\nwith a lot of actionable tools.\nSome of you might be curious,\nwhat a clinical hypnosis\nsession looks like.\nAnd for that reason, we had\nDr. Spiegel hypnotize me.\nA clip of that hypnosis session,\nis going to be posted to the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel,\nwhich is available on YouTube.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public,\nin keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one,\nvitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012.\nSo, I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens,\nonce or twice a day,\nis that it covers all of my foundational,\nvitamin, mineral, probiotic needs.\nThere is now ample evidence\nthat probiotics can be very helpful\nfor supporting what is\ncalled the gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome is an\naspect of our biology in which,\nlittle gut microbiota live all\nalong our digestive pathway\nand help support various\naspects of our biology,\nincluding our immune system,\nour metabolic system,\nour hormone or endocrine system,\nas well as what's called\nthe gut brain access,\nwhich is literally\ncommunication between the gut\nand the brain to support things like mood,\nmotivation and various other\naspects of brain health.\nWith Athletic Greens, I get the probiotics\nthat I need to support\na healthy gut microbiome\nand the vitamins and minerals tap off,\nany deficiencies I might have,\nbased on lack of certain foods\nand lack of certain nutrients in my diet.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey give you five free travel packs,\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nThere's a lot of evidence\nnow that vitamin D3\nis critically important\nfor various aspects\nof immediate and long term health.\nAnd while many people\nget enough vitamin D3,\nmany people do not.\nSo, the year supply of vitamin D3,\nought to be very useful for many people,\nand K2 has been shown to be important for,\ncalcium regulation, various\naspects of metabolic health\nand so forth.\nSo again, if you'd like\nto try Athletic Greens\nand get that special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nand a year supply of vitamin D3 K2,\ngo to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics,\na nootropic is a smart drug.\nAnd personally, I'm not a big fan\nof the concept of a smart drug.\nAt least not the way that\nmost people talk about,\nsmart drugs or nootropics,\nfor the following reason,\nbeing smart involves various things.\nThere is creativity, there's focus,\nthere's task switching and so on.\nAnd each one of those\ninvolves different operations\nin the brain, different neural circuits,\ndifferent neurochemicals\nhave to be deployed,\nin order for us to, for\ninstance, be very focused\nor for us to be very creative\nor for us to be able\nto switch tasks easily.\nThesis understands this\nand for that reason,\nthey've developed custom nootropics,\nthat are aimed at getting\nyour brain and body\ninto particular states for\nparticular types of work\nor physical activity.\nIn order to accomplish that,\nthey created unique blends\nof high quality ingredients.\nAnd each of those blends is designed\nto get your brain and body\ninto a particular mode,\nsuch as focus, clarity or motivation.\nI've been using Thesis nootropics\nfor over six months now.\nAnd I have to say it's\nbeen a total game changer\nand very unique from\nthe experience of using,\nsort of what I call, catchall nootropics.\nSo with Thesis, it's really directed\ntoward particular brain-body states.\nI should also mention\nthat they tailor those\ncustom blends to you.\nSo, by taking a quiz on their site,\nthey will tailor the blend to\nyou and your specific needs\nand the things you don't want.\nSo, if you want to try your own,\npersonalized nootropics starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman\nyou'll take a three minute quiz\nand thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAnd then based on the outcomes with those,\nthey can update your formulations for you.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout,\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat I believe are of the utmost quality.\nThe company was found by,\ntwo All-American Swimmers from Stanford\nand everything about the design\nof ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nwas created with performance in mind.\nThere are a number of things about,\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat I particularly like,\nfirst of all, they're\nextremely lightweight.\nYou basically forget\nthat you're wearing them.\nSecond of all, you can wear them for work,\nfor going out to dinner, et cetera.\nThey have great aesthetics,\nso you can wear them anywhere,\nbut also for exercise.\nYou can wear them when running or cycling,\nand even if you get sweaty,\nthey're designed so that they\ndon't slip off your face.\nAnother terrific feature of\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nis that they were designed\nwith the biology of the\nvisual system in mind.\nWe all have the experience\nof being in a shaded area\nand then going to a bright area,\nit takes some time for your\neyes to adjust or to adapt.\nMany sunglasses make it hard to see\nas you move from one\nenvironment to the next\nand therefore, you have to take\non and off your sunglasses,\nwith ROKA sunglasses, you\ndon't have to do that.\nYou don't even notice the transitions\nbetween those bright areas\nand those dimer areas.\nSo, you can wear them anywhere, anytime.\nAnd again, most of the time,\nyou don't even realize\nthat they're on your face.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\ngo to roka.com, that's roka.com\nand enter the code

much for being here.\n- Andrew, my pleasure.\n- Can you tell us, what is hypnosis?\n- Hypnosis is a state of\nhighly focused attention.\nIt's something like looking\nthrough the telephoto lens\nof a camera in consciousness,\nwhat you see, you see with great detail,\nbut devoid of context.\nIf you've had the experience\nof getting so caught up in a good movie,\nthat you forget you're watching a movie\nand a enter the imaginary world.\nYou're part of the movie,\nnot part of the audience,\nyou're experiencing it,\nyou're not evaluating it.\nThat's a hypnotic like experience\nthat many people have\nin their everyday lives.\n- So, is any experience\nthat really draws us in,\nhypnotic in that sense?\nOr let me give a different example.\nIf I'm watching a sports game\nand I'm really wrapped up in the game,\nbut I'm also in touch with how\nit makes me feel in my body\nkind of registering the\nexcitement or the anticipation.\nIs that a state of hypnosis also,\nbecause you mentioned there's kind of,\na narrowing of context.\n- Right.\n- But a kind of losing of the self,\nor is it, do I have that right?\n- Yes, it is true that you're-\n[indistinct] to the extent\nthat you're somatic,\nyour body experience is\na part of the sport event\nthat you're engaged with.\nI'd say that is a self\naltering hypnotic experience.\nIf your physical reactions\nare distracting you\nor make you think about something else,\nthat's when it's less hypnotic like,\nand more, just one of a\nseries of experiences.\n- Okay.\nSo I have to ask,\nhow did you get into this\nbusiness of hypnosis?\nBecause,\nI think for most people,\nwhen they hear hypnosis or\nthey think about hypnosis,\nthey think of stage hypnosis.\n- Right.\n- They think of somebody with\na pendant going back and forth\nor people up on a stage,\nbehaving abnormally for the\nentertainment of others.\n- Yeah.\n- How did you get into hypnosis\nas an interest, as a practice?\nAnd if you would,\ncould you contrast the sort\nof hypnosis that you do\nin the clinical setting\nwith a sort of hypnosis\nthat a stage hypnotist does?\n- Sure.\nWell, it is something of a\ngenetic illness in my family.\nBoth of my parents were\npsychiatrists and psychoanalysts\nand they told me I was free\nto be any kind of\npsychiatrist I wanted to be.\nSo, here I am.\nMy father was training to\nbe a psychoanalyst in 1943.\nAnd,\nhe ran into a Vietnamese refugee,\nwho couldn't serve in the army,\nbut who had studied hypnosis.\nAnd actually it would interest you,\ndoing your ophthalmological research.\nHe had a smallpox scar right\nin the middle of his forehead,\nand he did forensic examinations.\nAnd he noticed that some of the prisoners,\nwould focus on that spot on his forehead\nand then close their eyes\nand seem to go to sleep.\nBut they were in some altered state.\nSo he got interested in hypnosis.\nHe used it forensically\nand his name was Gustav von Aschaffenburg.\nAnd he offered to teach\nyoung psychiatrists,\nhow to use hypnosis when\nthey went off into the war.\nAnd so he trained my father\nand my got off the\nanalytic couch and asked,\nthe analyst mentioned it to him.\nThat's how he found out about it.\nAnd my father said, did I say\nsomething wrong in analysis?\nWhy is he talking to me [laughs] now?\nAnd he found it very\nuseful in helping soldiers\nwho had acute pain when they were wounded\nand helping people with conversion\nin post-traumatic stress disorders.\nAnd when he came back, he\nwent back to his training,\nbut he still was sort of interested in it.\nAnd he had his, one of his supervisors\nwas Frieda Fromm-Reichmann,\nwho was a very famous psychoanalyst.\nAnd he said that he had been\ntold to stop doing hypnosis\nbecause it would ruin his\nreputation as an analyst.\nAnd she said to him,\nwhat are you so worried of\nabout your reputation for?\nYou're going to give a course\nat the institute in hypnosis,\nand I know you're going to do\nit because I'm going to take it.\nSo he was teaching Frieda\nFromm-Reichmann hypnosis,\nand he just kept doing it.\nAnd after a while,\nhe discovered that he was\ngetting better results\nwith a few sessions of hypnosis\nthan he was with daily\npsychoanalysis with his patients.\nAnd so he switched his practice.\nAnd so the dinner table conversations,\nwere pretty interesting.\nAnd occasionally when he was\nmaking a movie of a patient,\nI would get to watch that.\nAnd so, when I went to medical school,\nI figured I'll take a course.\n[mumbles] Tom Hackett,\nwho was a chair of psychiatry\nof mass general was teaching\nand it was a very interesting course.\nAnd the day that converted me was,\nI was doing my rotation at\nChildren's Hospital in Boston.\nAnd the nurse is telling me,\nSpiegel, your next patient is an asthmatic\nin room 437 or something.\nAnd I'm just following,\nthe sound of the wheezes down the hall.\nI go in the room, there's\na 16 year old girl,\nknuckles white, bolt upright\nin bed, struggling for breath.\nYou can hear the wheezing.\nShe twice had subcutaneous\nepinephrine, didn't work.\nThey were thinking\nabout general anesthesia\nand starting her on steroids.\nAnd her mother's there crying.\nAnd I said, I don't know what else to do.\nSo I said, you want to\nlearn a breathing exercise?\nAnd she nods.\nAnd I got her hypnotized.\nAnd then I realized we\nhadn't gotten to asthma\nin the course yet.\nSo, I made up something very complex.\nI said, each breath you\ntake will be a little deeper\nand a little easier.\nAnd within five minutes,\nshe's lying back in bed.\nHer knuckles aren't\nwhite, she's not wheezing.\nHer mother stopped crying.\nThe nurse ran out of the room,\nand the intern, my intern comes to find me\nand I figured he is going to\npat me on the back and say,\nnice job, Spiegel.\nHe said, the nurse has filed a complaint\nwith a nursing supervisor\nthat you violated a\nMassachusetts law by hypnotizing,\na minor without parental consent.\nAnd I thought, oh, that's nice.\nI doubt there is a law like this.\nSo, the interns says,\nyou're going to have to\nstop doing this with her.\nAnd I said, why?\nHe said, it's dangerous.\nI said, you're going to\ngive her general anesthesia\nand put her on steroids,\nand talking to her is dangerous?\nHe said, well, you'll have to do it.\nAnd I said, I'll tell you what,\ntake me off the case if you want,\nbut I'm not going to\ntell a patient of mine,\nanything I know is not true.\nSo, there was a battle over\nthe weekend about what to do,\nand the intern, the chief\nresident, the attending,\nwere all arguing about it.\nAnd on Monday they came\nback with a radical idea.\nThey said, let's ask the patient.\nI don't think this has ever been done\nat children's [chuckles] hospital before.\nAnd she said, oh, I like this.\nShe'd been hospitalized every month\nfor three months in status asthmaticus,\nshe did a one subsequent\nhospitalization but after that,\nwent on to study to be\na respiratory therapist.\nAnd I thought that anything,\nthat can help a patient that much,\nviolate a nonexistent Massachusetts law,\nfrustrate the nursing supervisor,\nhad to be worth looking into.\nSo, I just kept doing it.\nI discovered that there were,\nall of my classmates in medical school,\nhad just read the new issue\nof the New England Journal\nand had some new medication to suggest.\nAnd I would, you know,\nsurgeons would say, look,\nif you can help this guy\nwith his pain or his anxiety,\nanything above the neck,\nthat's yours, do it, Spiegel.\nSo, I was having fun and being able\nto learn how to help people\nin a way that just otherwise\nwas not being done.\nAnd so, it got me thinking\nabout the fact that,\nwe're born with this brain\nbut we don't have a user's manual for it.\nAnd we don't use it\nnearly as well as we can.\nAnd that's something your\nresearch is all about too.\nAnd so, I thought,\nI want to understand this better.\nAnd I want to see what we can do.\nStage hypnotists drive me nuts.\nThey make fools out of people.\nThere was one.\nThis is a case my father was involved.\nHe got a call from, he was\nat Columbia, he got a call,\nSpiegel, you got to come see\nthis woman, she's in the ER.\nAnd she's in some kind of weird\nupset state that happened.\nAnd it turned out she'd been on the show\nwith a stage hypnotist who,\nand what they do by the way is,\nthey cycle around, you know,\nThe beginning of the show,\nthey don't just grab somebody\nand say, we're doing this.\nThey get a bunch of people up.\nThey do what [indistinct] testing,\nto see if people-\nand they get the ones who\nare the most hypnotizable.\nSo she was the one.\nAnd he said, there's now a\nlittle bird in your hand,\nand you're going to play with the bird.\nAnd she starts to cry and scream.\nAnd he just gets her off the stage,\n'cause it's very upsetting.\nAnd she's wandering around New York City\nin the middle of the night dissociated\nand brought to Columbia.\nAnd that's where my father saw her.\nShe was still in a kind of\nuncomfortable trance like state.\nAnd it turned out,\nthat she was the trophy\nwife of a very wealthy guy.\nAnd she felt like a bird in a gilded cage.\nAnd so to her,\nthat image just triggered\nall of this sense of,\ndissatisfaction and discomfort,\nfear about her life.\nAnd he was able to get her\nreoriented and talk with her\nabout what she was going to of her life.\nBut I don't like stage hypnosis.\nYou're making fools out of people\nand you're using the fact,\nand that's what scares\npeople about hypnosis.\nThey think you're losing control.\nYou're gaining control.\nSelf-hypnosis is a way of\nenhancing your control,\nover your mind and your body.\nIt can work very well,\nbut because it gives you a\nkind of cognitive flexibility,\nyou're able to shift sets very easily.\nTo give up judging and\nevaluating the way you usually do\nand see something from a\ndifferent point of view.\nThat's a great therapeutic opportunity,\nbut if misused, it could be a danger too,\nand that's what scares people about it.\nIt is that very ability to\nsuspend critical judgment\nand just have an experience\nand see what happens.\nThat can be a great\ntherapeutic opportunity,\nbut if somebody's misusing it,\nit can be a way to harm people.\nAnd there are plenty\nof examples of people,\nhaving fantasies imposed on them,\nthat they come to think are realities.\nIt's not unusual these days.\nSo,\nit's an ability that,\nif people learn to\nrecognize and understand it,\ncan be a tremendous therapeutic tool.\n- I've been stage hypnotized\nand I've been clinically\nhypnotized many times\nthrough a self-hypnosis app.\nWe'll talk about later.\nAnd then I know we have plans\nfor you to hypnotize me today.\nYou've done it once before.\n- Mm-hm.\n- [Andrew] And I'm very hypnotizable\nas we both know.\n- Right.\n- We'll talk about,\nhow one can gauge their hypnotizability.\n- Sure.\n- But the stage hypnosis,\nwas interesting.\nThis was in college,\nthey brought someone out to the dormitory\nand,\nI recall being one of the people\nthat was selected.\n- Mm-hm.\n- And engaging in very\nbizarre behavior, right?\nIt wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,\nbut it was pretty embarrassing.\nAnd then being sent off the stage,\nand as I was exiting,\nsuddenly screaming something out\nbecause he had planted a\nsuggestion of some sort.\n- Ah, mm-hm.\n- And then I was told\nto look in my pocket and there was,\nlike a, I think, a torn up dollar bill.\nThere were a bunch of things\nthat I have vague recollection of.\n- Mm-hm.\nBut it raises set of questions\nthat really boil down to,\nas a biologist, I always think that,\nthere's no events in the\nbrain, there are processes.\nAnd so hypnosis, we know has an induction.\nThen one is hypnotized, I imagine.\nAnd then it sounds like this woman\nand this example of the bird\nand being distraught in New York City,\nis a failure to exit the hypnotic state.\nDo we know what sorts of\nbrain areas are active\nduring the induction,\nlet's call it the deep hypnosis\nand then what's shutting off\nor changing as people exit hypnosis.\n- Yes, we do, we've studied that.\nWe've been very interested in that.\nAnd so, we did a study\nwhere we selected highly\nand non-hypnotizable people\nso we could do the comparison.\nAnd then hypnotize them in\nthe functional MRI scanner.\nAnd we found three things\ncharacterized the entry\ninto the hypnotic state.\nThe first is turning down activity\nin the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.\nSo the DACC is in the central\nfront-middle part of the brain\nas you well know.\nAnd it's part of what we\ncall the salience network.\nIt's a conflict detector.\nSo if you're engaged in work\nand you hear a loud noise\nthat you think might be a gunshot,\nthat's your anterior\ncingulate cortex saying,\nhey, wait a minute,\nthere's some potential danger over there.\nYou better pay attention to it.\nSo, it compares what you're doing\nwith what else is going on\nand helps you decide what to do.\nAnd as you can imagine,\nturning down activity in that region,\nmake it less likely that\nyou'll be distracted\nand pulled out of whatever you're in.\nAnd in another study,\nwe found that highly hypnotizable people,\neven without being hypnotized,\nhave more functional\nconnectivity between the DACC,\nthe anterior cingulate cortex\nand the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex.\nSo, which is part of a key region\nin the executive control network.\nSo, when you're engaging in tasks,\nyou're enacting a plan,\nyou're writing a paper, you're\ndoing whatever you're doing.\nThat's the prefrontal\ncortex who's doing that.\nAnd so, if that is coordinated,\nwe found more functional connectivity.\nSo, when one is up, the other's up\nand one is down, the other's down.\nThat coordination implies\nthat the brain is saying,\nokay, go ahead, I know what you're doing.\nCarry out that plan.\nAnd don't worry about other possibilities.\nSo, two other things happen\nwhen people are hypnotized.\nOne is that that DLPFC has\nhigher functional connectivity\nwith the insula.\nAnother part of the salience network.\nIt's a part of the\nmind-body control system,\nsensitive to what's happening in the body.\nIt's part of the pain network as well,\nbut it's also a region of the brain where,\nyou can control things in your body\nthat you wouldn't have think you could.\nFor example, we did a study years ago,\nwhere we took people who\nwere highly hypnotizable,\nhypnotized them and told them,\nwe went on a imaginary culinary tour.\nSo, they would eat their\nfavorite foods and we found that,\nthey increased their gastric\nacid secretion, like by 87%.\nSo, their stomach was acting\nas though it was about to get,\nI mean, there was one woman,\nit was so vivid for her that\nhalfway through, she said,\nlet's stop, I'm full, [laughs]\neating these imaginary-\n- Having never eaten-\n- Having never eaten anything-\n- Actual food?\n- No.\n- Incredible.\n- And then we got them\nto relax and think of\nanything but food or drink.\nAnd we got like a 40% decrease\nin gastric acid secretions.\nAnd that was DLPFC through the insula,\ntelling the stomach you're getting food\nor you're not getting food.\nAnd even, we injected\nthem with Pentagastrin,\nwhich triggers gastric acid release.\nAnd even then in the hypnosis condition,\nthey had a 19% reduction in gastric acid.\nSo, the brain has this amazing ability\nto control what's going on in the body\nin ways that we don't think\nwe have ability to control.\nThat's just one example.\nSo, that's the DLPFC insula connection.\nThe third thing that happens,\nand this relates to what\nyou did on the stage,\nis you have inverse\nfunctional connectivity\nbetween the DLPFC and the\nposterior cingulate cortex.\nThe posterior cingulate is part\nof the default mode network.\nIt's in the back of the brain.\nAnd it's an area whose\nactivity goes down for example,\nin meditators.\nAnd in meditation, you're\nsupposed to be selfless.\nYou're supposed to, [indistinct]\nself is an illusion,\nyou're supposed to let it dissolve\nand just experience things.\nAnd when you're doing that,\nthe posterior cingulate\nis decreasing in activity,\nthe inverse connection is,\nI'm doing something\nbut I'm not thinking about\nwhat it means for me.\nI may not even remember much of it.\nif I do, I don't care that much about it.\nAnd so, that is part of the dissociation\nthat I occur with hypnosis.\nSo, it's how you put things\noutside of conscious awareness,\nand don't worry about what it means.\nIt also adds to cognitive flexibility.\nIf you're thinking,\nwell, people like me\ndon't usually do this.\nThat may inhibit you from,\nenacting a new form of\npsychotherapy for example,\nthat you've never done before.\nBut if you're having\nthis decreased activity\nin the part of your brain that\nreflects on what it means,\nyou're more likely to\nbe cognitively flexible\nand willing to give it a try.\nAnd that's one of the\ntherapeutic advantages\nof hypnosis as well.\n- Fascinating, and it's really,\nI'm going to embarrass\nyou here a little bit.\n[David laughing]\nIn the positive sense,\nyour laboratory is really the one\nthat's pioneered brain\nimaging of hypnotic states.\nAnd, it sounds like it,\nthat's my understanding, is that correct?\n- Yeah, I mean, there are other people,\nwho've done excellent research too.\n- Sure.\nPierre Rainville in Montreal\nand several other people,\nbut we're one of the leading labs\nin neuroimaging of hypnosis.\n- I have to ask about,\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nI get a lot of questions about this.\nAnd I think a lot of people just struggle\nwith holding attention nowadays,\nbecause of interference\nwith phones and devices.\nAnd of course, there is a lot of,\nclinically legitimate ADHD out there,\nbut the way that you describe,\n- Sure.\n- the dorsal anterior cingulate\nand the salience network and\nthis a conflict detector of,\nam I focusing on something or\nam I splitting my attention?\nHow distractable am I?\nSeems to relate to some extent to activity\nin the anterior cingulate cortex.\nDo people with ADHD,\ndisplay disruptions in\nelements of these networks\nand has hypnosis ever been used to,\nor self-hypnosis, I should be,\nto distinguish from stage hypnosis,\nclinical and self-hypnosis been used\nto enhance people's ability to focus\nand hold attention?\nBecause that's such a built in component\nof the hypnotic state.\n- It's a great question.\nThere's sort of two\nways to think about it,\nin terms of enhancing focus, yes.\nIt has been very helpful\nin teaching people\nto just prepare your mind\nto narrow in and focus on something.\nAnd when you're really\nengaged in reading something,\nor you're writing a pa-\nI mean, I'll have that,\nsometimes I'm thinking,\noh God, I have to do\nthis for another hour.\nOther times an hour will\ngo by and I'll think,\nhey, great, because when you're in that,\nit feels game-like to you,\nyou're just assembling\nthe parts of the puzzle\nand putting 'em together.\nIt's fun, you just get absorbed,\nthat for me, that's a\nhypnotic like experience,\nwhen I'm having trouble,\nwhen I'm struggling,\nsometimes doing things like\nself-hypnosis can help.\nI'm not an expert on ADHD.\nMy impression is that you're right,\nthat these are people who\nare constantly distracted\nand rather rigid.\nThe other part of it is\nthey're easily distractable.\nThey're very upset when\nthey get distracted\nand they're rather rigid in\nwhat they want to attend to\nand what they can.\nI think, as a way of controlling this,\ndistractibility, frankly.\nMy guess is that many people with ADHD,\nwould not be that hypnotizable,\nbut I haven't studied it.\nSo, it's possible that for\nsome people with that disorder,\ntraining in self-hypnosis might help,\nbut we'd have to see how\nhypnotizable they were\nand take it from there.\n- I want to return to some of\nthe underlying neural networks\nand the clinical applications but,\nwhat sorts of things\naside from the asthma,\nhave you used hypnosis successfully for\nor have others used clinical hypnosis for?\nAnd are there any particular areas of,\npsychiatric challenges or\nillnesses, I guess they're called,\nthat are particularly amenable\nto hypnotic treatment.\n- Yes, there are.\nHypnosis is very good as a\nproblem focused treatment.\nIt's the oldest western\nconception of a psychotherapy,\nand it can be used for specific problems\nin a way that's very helpful.\nWe found it very helpful\nfor stress reduction.\nFor helping people deal,\nwe're all dealing with stress these days.\nAnd it's helpful, that mind-body\nconnection is very helpful\nbecause part of the problem\nwith stress is your perception.\nYou mentioned earlier\nin a sort of good sense,\nyou're at a football game or something,\nand you feel the physical reaction.\nThat can be a reinforcing thing.\nWow, this is exciting, let's do it.\nIt can also be very distracting.\nSo, you're worried about getting COVID\nor you're worried about,\nsome other physical problem you have.\nAnd you notice it in your\nbody, your body tenses up,\nyou start to sweat.\nThe sympathetic nervous system goes,\nyour heart rate goes up.\nAnd when you notice that you think,\noh God, this is really bad.\nAnd then you feel worse.\nSo, it's like a snowball rolling downhill.\nAnd then you feel worse and\nthen your body gets worse.\nHypnosis can be very helpful\nin dissociating somatic reaction\nfrom psychological reactions.\nSo, we teach people\nto imagine their body\nfloating somewhere safe\nand comfortable like a bath, a lake,\na hot tub or floating in space,\nand then picture the problem\nthat's stressing them\non an imaginary screen,\nwith the rule, no matter\nwhat you see on the screen,\nyou keep your body comfortable.\nSo, at this point, you still\ncan't control the stress,\nbut you can control your\nphysical reaction to it.\nAnd that starts you\nfeeling more in control.\nAt least there's one thing I can manage.\nAnd then you can use it to think through\nor visualize through\none thing you might do\nabout that stressor.\nSo, hypnosis is very\nhelpful in controlling\nmind-body interaction\nin relation to stress.\nIt's very helpful for\npeople to get to sleep.\nWe're having a lot of fun with that.\nI'm getting emails from people who said,\nI haven't slept right in 15 years,\nand now for the first time,\nI'm listening to your app\nand I can sleep at night.\nSo it's very helpful and again,\nif you wake up in the middle of the night,\nI tell people, don't look at the clock.\nThat's an arousal cue.\nYou'll wake up more,\nbut picture whatever you're\nthinking about or worrying about\non that imaginary screen\nwhile your body is floating.\nSo, watch your own movie,\nbut keep your body floating.\nAnd many people can use\nthat to get back to sleep.\n- I've been using self-hypnosis\nfor sleep for a long time.\nAnd now the Reveri app,\nand we'll talk about our\nrelationship to the Reveri app\nand its uses.\nI find it incredibly useful\nfor falling back asleep\nin the middle of the night.\nAnd it raises a question,\nI've found and I think I\nunderstand this correctly,\nthat one can do self-hypnosis\nduring the daytime.\nAnd then if there's an\nissue that comes up later,\nlike, so for instance,\ndo self-hypnosis for stress reduction,\naway from the stressful\nevent to prepare one\nto deal with stress better.\n- Right.\n- Or do hypnosis for\nimproving the return to sleep.\nAnd that can be done when you\nactually want to go to sleep.\nBut it's kind of a training\nup of these networks,\nright?\n- That's right.\n- So, is there evidence that,\nthese brain networks actually\nform stronger connections,\nwhen people do self-hypnosis over time?\n- Well, there's a rule in\nneurobiology as you know,\nthat neurons that fire\ntogether wire together.\n- Our friend, Carla Shatz.\n- Yes, Carla-\n- Not Donald Hebb, by the way.\n[David laughing]\nI keep trying to,\nthere's a widespread myth in the world\nthat is unfortunately,\nall over the internet,\nwhich is that, fire together\nwire together was said by,\nthis psychologist, Donald Hebb\nDonald Hebb did many important things,\nbut it is the neurobiologist Carla Shatz-\n- That's exactly right.\n- Who,\nYes, is at Stanford but was\nalso at Berkeley and Harvard.\nSo, also decent schools.\n- That's exactly right.\n- But is at Stanford, who said,\nfire together wire together.\nAnd so she deserves,\n- Right.\n- the credit for that statement.\nYeah, so with repeated\nuse of self-hypnosis,\none could imagine that these\nnetworks are getting stronger.\n- I would think so.\nWe don't have evidence of that yet,\nbut long term potentiation\nprovides a pathway\nand you've described them on\nyour program, a number of times\nthat allow for repeated\nactivation of a network\nto actually build new\nconnections that work.\nAnd at the least,\neven from a learning and\nmemory point of view,\nmemory is all a network of associations.\nThat's how we remember things.\nAnd the example I'd like to give is,\nyou go back to your grade school\nand you see these little tiny lockers\nand the size is all wrong.\nAnd you suddenly have a flood of memories\nthat were obviously stored there,\nbut you just didn't think of.\nSo, context and association\nis what memory's about.\nIf you start to acquire\nmemories about a problem.\nSo, one thing we use hypnosis for\nis treating phobias, for example.\nAnd the problem with\npeople who have phobias,\nlike airplane phobias\nor crossing a bridge or being up high,\nis that the more they avoid it the more,\nthe only source of associations\nand memories is their fear.\nThey don't have any\ngood experiences with it\n'cause they avoid it.\nIt's like get back on the horse\nafter you fall off kind of thing.\nAnd with hypnosis,\nif you can start people able\nto manage their anxiety enough\nthat they can have more, a\nwider array of experiences,\nthey start to have a\nnetwork of associations\nthat isn't so negative\nand may even be positive.\n- So it's almost like\na, sorry to interrupt,\nbut I have to ask.\n- Sure\n- It's almost like a,\nexposure therapy done in the mind.\n- Yes.\n- It's always in the mind.\nI mean, even that exposure\nto, if I have a snake phobia,\nwhich I don't, I don't like snakes,\nbut I don't think it qualifies\nas a full blown phobia.\nI think I have a healthy fear of snakes.\n- Yeah.\n- But if,\nlet's say I had a snake phobia,\nthe typical approach in, would be,\ncognitive behavioral approaches, right,\nwould be to show a picture of a snake,\nthen a rubber snake, then a real snake.\nEventually the person is,\n- Yeah.\n- holding a boa constrictor\nor something like that.\n- [David] Right.\n- That's all in the mind\nbecause it's all translate\ninto nervous system signals.\nBut with hypnosis,\nsounds like you can give a\nnumber of positive experiences\nwithout having to use any props,\nwithout having bring any\nanimals into the room.\n- Right, I-\n- Drive someone across\nthe bridge, is that right?\n- Yes, I had a woman,\nwho was a very successful business woman,\nhigh level in a corporation.\nI had a terrible dog phobia.\nAnd so I had her imagine that\nsomebody brought in the dog\nto the room and I said,\n\"what are you doing?\"\nAnd you could see her getting tense.\nAnd she said, \"Well, I'm waiting\nto see what the dog does.\"\nAnd I said, \"If somebody\nwho works for you,\ncomes into your office,\nwould you freeze and wait\nto see what they did?\"\nAnd she said, \"Of course not,\nI tell 'em what to do.\"\n[laughs] And I said, \"Well, so\nyou're immobilizing yourself,\nthe power isn't with\nthe dog it's with you,\nso, imagine what you\nmight do to engage the dog\nand help control the situation.\"\nAnd she said, \"Thanks.\"\nAnd this reminds me of,\none of my favorite stories\nabout hypnosis that,\nmy father was seeing a woman\nwho lived in Midtown Manhattan\nand had a horrible dog phobia.\nShe'd dropped things, she'd\nspill coffee if she saw a dog.\nShe would time her trips to the store,\nwhen she thought it was least likely\nthat people would be walking dogs.\n- Now that wouldn't be\npossible, everyone in-\n- [laughs] Everyone in New York has a dog\n- It's like a fleet of French Bulldogs,\n- Right, exactly.\n- taking over New York City.\n- So, he taught her to\nthink of dog as a friend,\nhave a neighbor who had a dog,\nbring the dog over but\nhold the dog by the collar\nand make sure,\nand gradually she was able\nto stroke the dog and say,\ndog friend and distinguish\nbetween wild and tame animals.\nThere are animals, you should\nbe afraid of [murmurs].\nSo, she seemed to be doing better.\nHe called back about three months later\nand asked for her.\n\"Well, who's calling?\" the son said.\nAnd he said, \"Dr. Spiegel.\"\nAnd the boy said, \"That's weird.\"\nAnd my father said, \"What's weird?\"\nHe said, \"Spiegel's in heat.\"\nShe had bought a dog,\n- I love it.\n- and named it, Spiegel.\n- I love it.\n- Talk about transference.\n- I love it.\n[David laughing]\nBut it really speaks to the power of this.\nAnd it brings me back to this issue.\nSo, what is different about,\nwhat your father did in\nthat case with this woman,\nin terms of what happened in hypnosis\nthat allowed her to go\nfrom being completely terrified of dogs\nto owning a dog and naming\nit after your father?\nWhich I find amusing.\n- Yeah.\n- But that's different\nthan just the two of them sitting down\nand talking about it, right?\nYou know, in therapy,\nnarrative is a huge component.\n- Right.\n- And in hypnosis narrative\nis a huge component.\n- Right.\n- So it must be that,\nthe brain state is what\nis really different.\nBecause we'll talk about\ntrauma in a few minutes.\nBut I think people who\nhave trauma or phobias,\ncertainly could have a\nconversation about it.\nSome of them might freeze up.\nSome of them might lose their\narticulation and so forth.\nBut what is different about that state\nthat combines with narrative,\nyou think to allow these\nunderlying neural networks\nto engage her to change?\n'Cause I find this so\nfascinating because we're a-\nEvery attempt at dealing\nwith stress or phobia\nin the clinical setting\ninvolves some discussion\nabout what it is.\n- Yes.\n- But, here we're not talking about\nany medication being introduced,\nat least not in these\nparticular circumstances.\n- Right.\n- So,\nI realize it's kind of an obvious question\nlike, it has to be some\ndifference in brain activity,\nbut I find that to be incredible.\nThe control variable\nthere is the brain state.\nIt's not, what's spoken.\n- You're raising a couple of\nvery important issues, Andrew.\nWe talked earlier about with\nsystematic desensitization,\nwhere you sort of lay\nout a hierarchy of things\nand do it one at a time.\nI think of this as\nunsystematic desensitization,\nbecause you're changing mental states.\nAnd I think there's more and more evidence\nthat mental state change itself\nhas therapeutic potential.\nWe're seeing that with\nketamine treating depression,\nthe dissociogenic drug.\nWe know it every morning when we wake up,\nthat problem, when you know,\nyou made the mistake of reading\na nasty email at 11:00 PM.\nYou didn't know what to do.\nYou wake up in the morning thinking,\noh, that idiot, yeah,\nhere's what I'm going to do.\nSo, just changing mental state,\nitself has therapeutic potential.\nAnd I think we underestimate\nour ability to regulate\nand change responses to be cognitively,\nemotionally and somatically flexible.\nAnd so, we do things, you're right,\nthat follow similar principles\nof facing a problem,\nseeing it from a different point of view.\nAnd you've done a really,\na nice podcast on trauma and stress\nand how you have to expose yourself to it,\nnot avoid it, as we talked about before.\nAnd then find some way to reconnect to it,\nto substitute something\nthat can make you feel good,\nrather than bad,\nso that you activate\nother centers of the brain\nlike mesolimbic reward system.\nAnd so, I that with hypnosis\nand you can do it much faster.\nPeople don't think they can but they can.\nIf you are having, right now\nthat physical experience,\nI'm thinking about this\nbut I'm not feeling as bad as I used to.\nThat can be a powerful thing\nand you can do it with hypnosis.\nSo, a woman came to see me,\nwho had suffered an attempted rape.\nIt was getting dark,\nshe was coming back from the grocery store\nand this guy grabs her\nand wants to get her\nup into her apartment.\nIt's outside her apartment.\nAnd she starts fighting with him\nand she winds up with a\nbasilar skull fracture.\nHe runs away.\nThe cops come,\nsince she hadn't been raped, they left,\nthey weren't interested.\nAnd she wanted to use hypnosis\nto get a better image of\nwhat this guy looked like,\nwhich is a painful, upsetting thing.\nSo, she was quite hypnotizable.\nI got her floating.\nI say, you're safe and comfortable, now,\nnothing can happen that\nwill harm your body.\nBut on the left side of the screen,\nI want you to picture this guy\nand his approaching and what's happening.\nAnd she said, I really, the light,\nit was getting dark.\nI really can't see much\nof his facial features,\nbut I do recognize something,\nI hadn't allowed myself to remember.\nIf he gets me upstairs,\nhe doesn't just want to rape\nme, he's going to kill me.\nAnd so, in some ways, what\nshe was seeing was even worse.\nSo, you're thinking, good, Spiegel,\nyou made her even more\nfrightened than she was before.\nBut as you had pointed out\nin your PTSD stress lecture,\nyou've got to confront the trauma,\nto restructure your understanding of it.\nSo, on the other side of the screen,\nI had her picture,\nwhat are you doing to protect yourself?\nAnd everybody in a trauma\nsituation engages in some strategy\nof self protection.\nThat's the salience network kicking in.\nAnd she said, \"You know what?\"\nHe's surprised that\nI'm fighting that hard.\nHe didn't think I would.\nAnd so, she realized on the one hand\nthat it was even worse\nthan she thought it was.\nBut on the other hand\nthat she actually probably saved her life.\nAnd so, it was a way of,\nhelping her restructure her\nexperience of the trauma\nand make it more tolerable.\nSo that helped with her-\nShe didn't recog-\nShe couldn't identify the guy,\nbut it helped her restructure\nand understand her experience.\nAnd that's something that you can do\nin just talking, straight\nout psychotherapy.\nBut sometimes you can do\nit a hell of a lot faster\nand more efficiently using hypnosis.\nAnd there is one randomized\ntrial out of Israel\nthat shows that adding\nhypnosis to PTSD treatment,\nactually improves outcome.\nSo it's a way of accomplishing\nthings that we understand\nin the broader psychotherapy\nworld, but much more quickly\nand sometimes effectively.\n- Yeah, it sounds like going\nsomewhat into the state\nthat one is trying to deal with,\nbut then dissociating\nfrom that state is key.\nAnd I could imagine,\nand I've been open about\nthis on various podcasts.\nI've done a lot of an\nanalysis over the years.\nI've experienced myself\nthat in those sessions,\ndepending on how I show up to them,\nI might just get kind of a\nlaundry list of what happened\nas opposed to actually feeling anything,\naround what happened.\n- Right.\n- And I think people\nprobably vary in the extent\nto which they can drop into feeling states\nand it can depend on the day.\nIt can depend on how well\nyou slept the night before\nand so on.\n- There's one thing I might add, Andrew,\n- Yes.\n- And that is,\nthere's a notion to late Gordon Bower,\nwe just had a memorial\nfor Gordon at Stanford.\nHe died about a year ago.\nBrilliant cognitive psychologist,\none of the founders of\ncognitive psychology at Stanford\nand a great pitcher.\nHe almost became a Major League pitcher\nbut he decided to go\nto grad school instead,\nand I'm glad he did.\nBut Gordon helped establish the concept of\nstate dependent memory\nthat when you're in a\ncertain mental state,\nyou enhance your ability to\nremember things about it.\nAnd sort of the bad example of that is\nthe drunk who hides the bottle\nand can't remember where he put it\nuntil he gets drunk again\nand he's in that same mental state.\nPeople go into dissociative\nstates when they're traumatized.\nSo in a way, hypnosis\nis helping them remember\nand deal with the memories better\nbecause they're more in the mental state\nthat is more like what happened.\nAnd most rape victims will tell you,\nI was floating above my body,\nfeeling sorry for the woman\nbeing assaulted below.\nPeople in traumatic\nepisodes, they just say,\nyou know, I blank out, I\ndon't know what's happening,\nI'm on autopilot\nand that's a kind of self hypnotic state.\nSo, when you use hypnosis\nto help them deal\nwith a traumatic memory,\nyou're making the state they're in,\nright there in your office with you,\nmore congruent to the\nstate they were likely in,\nwhen the trauma happened.\nAnd I think that is part of\nwhat helps facilitate treatment\nof trauma related disorders.\n- I see.\nSo that makes me have to ask,\nevery question I have to ask,\n'cause I really feel it as\na almost like compulsion,\nthen if dissociation during\na traumatic episode is,\nit's a part of the adaptive strategy.\n- Right.\n- But it creates certain issues,\nit creates problems, right?\nWhy would something like ketamine,\nwhich creates a dissociative state,\nbe useful for the treatment of trauma?\nThis is what I'm confused about these days\nbecause our colleague, Karl Deisseroth,\nwho's also been on this podcast\nand his coworkers have figured out,\nokay, there's these layer one\nnetworks in the neocortex,\nand those are involved\nin dissociative state.\nAnd so we're starting to\ngain some understanding\nof how ketamine works at a neural level.\n- Right.\n- It does seem,\nas if for certain populations\nit can be a useful treatment.\nI don't know, I've never tried it.\nI don't know what the\ncurrent status of that is,\nbut it is legal.\nIt is allowed at least in,\nit's FDA approved and it's in use.\nWhy would dissociative states be useful\nif some element of dissociation\nis what gave rise to the trauma\nmemory in the first place?\n- Well, yeah, and Karl\nhad a brilliant paper\nin nature where he,\nit was from rats to humans in one paper.\nAnd he showed that there's\nthis rhythmic discharge\nin the retrosplenial region,\nthat is triggered by ketamine.\nAnd the rats actually showed\ndissociative like behavior,\nin that they would a hot pad\nthat they ordinarily wouldn't\nand they didn't seem to\nhave much pain in their paw.\nAnd he then had a male subject\nwho had implanted electrodes-\n- Human, yeah.\n- A human subject, yeah.\nAnd the electrodes had picked\nup this rhythmic activity.\nAnd when they did,\nhe would report being\nin a dissociative state.\nAnd his description was,\nit's like being a pilot of an airplane.\nAnd then I felt myself\nwalking out of the cockpit\nand the plane was still flying and-\n- It sounds terrifying to me.\n[David laughing]\nIt sounds terrify terrifying.\n- That's the thing-\n- I want to be in my body,\n[David laughing]\nmost of the time, you know.\n- That's right but,\nthe point is, in a way\nthe principal, Andrew,\nis like, the principle you said,\nthat you need to re-confront\na traumatic situation\nbefore you can modulate\nyour associations to it.\nSo, you have to accept\nit, accept the arousal,\nput some boundaries around it\nand then figure out how you\ncan approach that problem\nor how you did approach that problem\nfrom a different point of view.\nSo, it does not surprise-\nIn fact, we've studied,\npeople who disassociated during\nthe Loma Prieta earthquake\nand the Oakland-Berkeley firestorm.\n- I remember both those well.\n- Yeah.\n- Earthquakes follow me.\nThen I move south and\nthen the Northridge quake-\n- I'm going to keep away from\nSo, there'll be one later, this afternoon.\n[David laughing]\n- I'm starting to dissociating.\nSo, dissociation does\ncompartmentalize experience,\nbut that means from the point\nof view of treating trauma,\nit's an inhibition.\nYou don't engage it.\nIt's like it happened over there.\nAnd I think what happens is that people,\nare sometimes too good at being able\nto separate themselves\nfrom their recollection.\nSo it's in there somewhere.\nIt's out of sight but\nit's not out of mind.\nIt's having effects on you,\nbut you can't deal with it.\nYou can't reprocess it.\nSo I do think one reason\nketamine might work\nis that in fact, it allows you to keep,\nto re-approach the dissociative experience\nin a way that you can\nthen start to think about\nand do something about it.\nAnd just the fact you\ncan turn it on and off.\nAnd that's also where\nself-hypnosis is so helpful.\nIt's not something that\njust comes over you\nand happens to you.\nIt's something you can make happen.\nYou can control it, you\ncan do something with it.\nSo, you feel less helpless\nand out of control.\nThe essence of trauma is helplessness.\nIt's not fear, it's not pain.\nIt's helplessness.\nYou become an object.\nYou become just your body.\nYou don't control what's going on.\nAnd we're not used to that.\nYou and I have discussed\nthis breathing paper\non anticipation of breathing.\nAnd it's not whether you breathe,\ninhale or exhale or hold your breath,\nit's that if you think you\ncan inhale and you can't,\nthat is really upsetting, understandably.\nAnd so, the issue is control\nand hypnosis, which has\nthis terrible reputation\nof taking away control\nis actually a superb way\nof enhancing your control\nover mind and body.\n- I love that and it reminds\nme that naming is so important.\nYou almost wonder if self-hypnosis\nand clinical hypnosis had\nbeen called something else,\nthat it would've been separated\nout from stage hypnosis\nin a way that would make it less scary,\nweird, complicated for people to embrace.\nBut,\n- Yeah.\n- part of the reason for\nhaving this discussion is,\nI've had great experiences with hypnosis,\nthat I've seen the data,\nwe're talking about a\nlot of clinical examples.\nIt's incredibly powerful\nand it boils right down\nto neural brain states.\n- Right.\n- And,\nI think in the years to come,\nit's going to become more\nwidespread along those lines.\nHow quickly,\nyou've described some examples\nof people getting relief very quickly.\n- Right.\n- How permanent,\nare those changes?\nIs there a need for follow\nup and related to that,\nI'm sure a number of people\nare listening to this\nand thinking, wonderful,\nI'd love to get hypnotized\nfor any number of different\nthings by Dr. Spiegel\nor somebody else expert\nin clinical hypnosis,\nbut they might not have access to you\nor somebody with similar training.\nSo what is the power?\nSo, how quickly does it work?\nHow long lasting are those changes?\nAnd then,\nis it necessary to work\nwith a clinical hypnotist?\nAnd is it better to do that\nthan self-hypnosis and so on and so forth?\nMaybe you could just give us a contour\nof the landscape of directed\nand self-directed treatment.\n- Well, typically,\nmost people start by coming\nto see a clinician like me.\nIt's better to see\nsomeone who has licensing\nand training in their\nprofessional discipline,\nmedicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever.\n- 'Cause there are a lot\nof hypnotists out there,\nwho are just hypnotist.\n- Right.\nJust hypnotists.\n- Oh, okay.\n- And the key issue is,\nsomebody who can really\nassess what your problem is\nand make sure that you're not,\ntalking someone into\nreducing their chest pain,\nrather than getting their\ncoronary artery problem-\n- 'Cause they could\nhave a real issue there.\n- They could, right.\n- That hypnosis might adjust\nbut wouldn't deal with the\ndeeper underlying issue.\n- That's right.\nOn the other hand.\nAnd typically when I use it with people,\nI often only see them once\nor twice or periodically,\nbut not every week.\nAnd certainly not every day,\nif they have a pain problem\nand hypnosis is very helpful for pain.\nAnd so, what I'm doing is,\nidentifying how hypnotizable they are.\nI give them a standard brief test\nof their ability to experience hypnosis,\nand then going through a\nself-hypnosis exercise with them\nto deal with the problem,\nseeing how they respond to it,\nand then teaching them how\nto do it for themselves.\nAnd in the old days,\nI used to have them use\ntheir iPhone and record\nthat part of the session.\nSo they could play back\nthe hypnosis experience.\nNow we've developed an app, \"Reveri,\"\nthat can teach people\nand step them through,\ndealing with pain, stress,\nfocus, insomnia and help people eat better\nand stop smoking.\nBut we have elements that\ntake about 15 minutes\nand elements that just\ntake one or two minutes\nthat people can refresh and reinforce.\n- Two minute hypnosis,\n[indistinct] one minute.\n- Yes.\n- Yeah.\n- And it's one to two,\nwe're one to two minutes now,\nand we're finding that two\nthirds of the people find\nthat even just the one minute refresher,\nhelps them feel better.\nThey're reporting, they feel better.\nSo, the nice thing is,\nyou know right away,\nwhether it's likely to help you or not.\nAnd we've found, we've done studies,\nlooking at hypnosis for pain relief\nin acute medical procedures.\nWe did a randomized trial that\nwe published in The Lancet,\nthree conditions, people\ngetting arterial cutdowns\nto chemoembolized tumors in the liver\nor visualize renal artery stenosis.\nYou don't use general anesthesia for this.\nIt's very uncomfortable\nand people are anxious\nand we had three conditions.\nOne was standard care,\nthey could push a button\nand get opioids, IV.\n- This is during the surgery?\n- During the surgery.\nThe second is, they could do that,\nplus they had a friendly\nnurse, comforting them.\nSo, we controlled for pleasant\nattention and support.\nAnd the third was, we\ntaught them self-hypnosis\nfor pain control.\nSo, you're feeling, you\ncan change the temperature,\nyou're your body is\ncool, tingling, and numb,\nyou're floating in ice water\nand feeling comfortable.\nOr go somewhere else,\nleave your body here and\ngo to a desert island\nand enjoy yourself.\nAnd we found that,\nit's about two and a half hour procedure,\nthat by an hour and a half,\nthe hypnosis group had\nreduced their pain by 80%,\ncompared to the standard,\n- Wow.\ncare group, using half\nthe amount of opioids,\nthey had fewer complications\nand the procedure took\n17 minutes less time\non average to get done.\nBecause not only was the\npatient more relaxed.\nSo was the treatment staff.\nThey weren't dealing with someone\nwho's struggling and uncomfortable.\nWe measured their anxiety and same thing.\nThey hypnosis group, I was\nworried they were all dead.\nThey had no anxiety\nafter an hour and a half,\nthey were saying, I'm fine, you know,\nand they were fine.\nAnd the standard care group,\nhad 5 out of 10 anxiety\nscores at that point.\nSo, we published that in The Lancet,\nbig randomized trial.\nIf we had a drug that did that,\nevery hospital in the country\nwould be using it now,\nbut there's no industry to push it.\nSo, that's part of what helped us decide\nthat we needed to help people,\ndo this with Reveri\nand teach them how to do it\nand provide interactive\nsupport for them to do it.\nAnd does it, the question, although is,\ndoes it work long term?\n'Cause what we can do acutely\ndoesn't necessarily carry on.\nSo, we did around\nrandomized trial of women\nwith metastatic breast cancer.\nThey had advancing disease.\nWe met with them in a\nsupport group once a week\nand taught them self-hypnosis,\nfor stress and anxiety and\npain control at the end.\nAnd by the end of a year,\nthe treatment group had half\nthe pain the control group did,\non the same, in very low\namounts of medication.\nSo, it lasts.\nAnd they would say,\nwhen I felt that pain in my chest\nand thought it was a metastasis,\nI just did the exercise.\nI got myself in a warm\nbath and I felt fine.\nSo, it works because it becomes\na skill that people acquire,\nbut they can tell right away,\nwhether it's likely to help them,\nworking with a clinician\nor now using the app\nor other ways of helping them\nlearn to use it as a skill.\nSo, the nice thing is you\nwill know very quickly,\nwhether it's likely to help you or not.\nAnd if it is, you can learn\nto do it for yourself.\n- That's great and we will,\nagain, there'll be a link\nto Reveri in the caption,\nit's available for Apple and Android.\nAnd I think even though\nthere's a nominal cost there,\nI think that, as you mentioned,\nmedications and other\napproaches to dealing\nwith these problems are quite expensive,\nand have all the potential\nfor side effects and things.\nNot that some of those aren't also useful.\n- Could I, before you get to that,\n- Please.\n- just one thing.\nWe've worked very hard on the app.\nWe have an iOS app for Apple.\nWe decided to table for a\nmoment, redoing the Android app.\nSo, it was available,\nwhen we were working\nthrough the Alexa platform.\nIt's not at the moment\nbut it will be soon.\nSo, I just don't want\npeople to be disappointed\nif they're looking for it for Android,\nit's on our agenda but we\ndon't have it at the moment.\n- Great, thanks for that clarification.\nSo hopefully, in time for both,\nI get asked a lot about obsessive thoughts\nor intrusive thoughts.\nI also get asked a lot about OCD.\nIs there any evidence that hypnosis\nor self-hypnosis can be used for,\ndealing with obsessive thoughts?\n- Sometimes, there are some\nvery obsessional people,\nwho just turn out not to\nbe that hypnotizable for,\nyeah, and it's not random.\nThey tend to be so over\ncontrolling of thought,\nthey're all busy evaluating\nrather than experiencing, so-\n- I know a few people like that.\n[David laughing]\nIt sounds like an adaptive\nmindset for a lot of professions.\n- That's right.\n- And then we get trained up in that,\n- Yeah.\n- during school,\nhow to obsess over the exam,\nobsess over the,\n- Yeah.\n- our social interactions.\nI mean, it's part of becoming\na functional human being.\nAnd yet, it can take us down a different-\n- We sometimes overdo it.\nI mean, I'll tell you one\nexample from extreme situations,\nthat, you know, you're\njudging, evaluating,\nyou're not letting yourself experience,\nincluding emotionally.\nI know somebody,\nwho listens to the tapes\nfrom airplanes that go down.\nSo, they get the black\nbox and they listen to it.\nAnd he said to me, you know-\n- That's his profession or\nhe does this recreational-\n- No, it's his profession.\n- Okay.\n- That's what he did.\n'Cause they're trying to\ndo accident prevention\nand how to handle things.\nAnd he said that you worry\nabout people panicking, right?\nAnd here these guys know\nthat they've got 30 seconds\nor some 45 seconds\nand they're just going\nthrough their checklist.\nHe said, they don't panic enough.\nThey're taught that this is what you do.\nAnd there is reason,\nthere's good reason for it.\nBut sometimes they overdo it.\nAnd it's painful to listen to this\n'cause you know what's going to happen.\nSo, it's kind of a balance we have to hit.\nAnd sometimes we get too\nemotional and too absorbed\nand you're not with that enough\nto sort of see other possibilities.\nThat can be a problem.\nBut on the other hand,\nsometimes you're too rigid and controlled\nand you don't let your emotions guide you\nto what you need to do to protect yourself\nor protect others.\nSo, I would say in general\nthat people with OCD are,\non the less hypnotizable\nside of the spectrum,\nthey're less likely to allow\nthemselves to engage in any,\nand the typical example is the checking\nwith OCD for example,\nthey don't remember,\nwhether they locked the door\nor turned off the gas in the\noven and they keep going back\nand they keep checking.\nSo, there the evaluative\ncomponent of the brain,\nkind of overrides the experiential one\nand sometimes people can get some benefit,\nbut they're not a group\nthat I would select\nfor being the most likely to respond\nto self hypnotic approaches.\n- Are superstitions similar?\n- Superstitions, I think that's more,\nthere are people who\nare very hypnotizable,\nwho keep getting caught up\nin things like superstitions\nand there, the imagination\nsupplants the reality.\nAnd we've seen a lot of\nthat happening recently.\nAnd so I think there,\nit's by possible that they\ncould be helped by learning\nto sort of see it but put it in context,\nsee it from a different point of view.\n- I developed a pretty\nvicious superstition,\nwhen I was in college and it\nwas hard to break, actually.\nI always feel, when I talk to clinicians,\nI have to reveal certain things\nabout my own pathology.\n- Please do.\n- And so-\n- You'll get my bill later.\n- Thank you, yes,\nit's part of the reason I arranged this.\n[David laughing]\nNo, I'm just kidding.\nBut yeah, I did.\nI had a habit of knocking\non wood for things\nand I noticed it started to,\nI would sneak knocking on\nwood every once in a while\n'cause I didn't want people to\nthink I was doing too often.\nAnd then I started to realize that,\nit was becoming a little bit of a reflex.\nAnd then I saw this incredible video\nfrom Bence Olveczky's lab at Harvard.\nHe studies motor patterns.\nAnd he has these rats that\npress different sequences\nof levers and turn dials in\norder to get a pellet of food.\nBut as they do that,\nthey'll start to introduce these behaviors\nthat have nothing to do with\nthe actual lever pressing,\nlike they'll start scratching\ntheir hind quarters\nand things like that.\nAnd their hat, their heads, excuse me,\nthey don't wear hats\nand flipping their ears.\nAnd this is just like a pitcher\nbefore throwing a baseball.\nThat we do this,\n- Oh, yeah.\n- we start to incorporate motor behaviors\nthat are unrelated to the outcome,\nbut our mind somehow starts to think\nthat they're necessary for the outcome.\nAnd so then you incorporate it.\nSo, I decided to break it\nby simply forcing myself\nto not do it for about a week.\n- Mm-hm.\nAnd then it just seemed like a ridiculous,\n- [Both] thing to do.\nYeah, well-\n- Knock on wood.\n- We call that response\nprevention and it works.\nWhat you do is,\nyou set up a new context in your brain,\nwhere you get the outcome you want,\ndevoid of the extraneous behavior.\n- Yeah, and I knew it was nuts, right.\nI knew it was illogical.\n- Right.\n- But somehow these\nthings take on meaning.\n- [David] Right.\n- So, we talked about,\nthe utility of hypnosis\nfor stress reduction,\nphobias, pain,\npossibly, we don't know but for,\nthings like ADHD and OCD,\nit just will depend on hypnotizability.\n- Right.\n- You talked about this\nbeautiful study on the,\nmetastatic breast cancer\noutcome or patients.\nHypnotizability is clearly a key variable.\n- Yes.\n- So could you please tell us,\nwhat hypnotizability is,\nhow it's evaluated\nand what The Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is?\n- Okay, sure.\nSo, hypnotizability is just a capacity\nto have hypnotic experiences.\nAnd we have a test called the\nhypnotic conduction profile.\nWhere we give a highly\nstructured hypnotic experience.\nAnd the old tradition in\nclinical hypnosis was,\nthat you try a bunch of different things,\ntalking, walking upstairs and downstairs\nand other images and time what you say\nto the breathing of the\nsubject and all that.\nAnd the more you change\nwhat you do as a clinician,\nthe less you can make of\nvariation and outcome.\nAnd it could take a long time, you know,\n20 minutes, 30 minutes.\nAnd I just view that as a kind of complex,\nnot very effective way\nof assessing the person's\nhypnotic capacity.\nWe know that the peak period\nof hypnotizability in the human life,\nis the latency years in childhood.\nSo, every eight year old is\nin a trance all the time.\nYou call all 'em in for\ndinner, they don't hear ya,\nthey're doing their thing.\nAnd that's why childhood is\nsuch a wonderful experience.\nWork and play are all the same thing.\nAnd we try to make them\ninto little adults,\nwhich I think is a terrible mistake.\nEverything is fun for them.\nThey enjoy learning,\nthey enjoy everything.\n- So what age are they in this-\n- This is like 6 to 10, 6 to 11.\nAnd they're playful,\nthey enjoy everything.\nEverything is sort of a game and fun\nand we try to make it miserable for them,\nbut they've got it.\nAnd then when, what Piaget called,\na more adult cognitive framework,\nwhere we learn abstract concepts,\nwe learn that even if\none bottle looks bigger\nthan the other, they\ncan have equal volume.\nAnd so, we at imposing logic,\nwe're growing our DLPFC at that point\nand imposing cognitive\nstructure on experience.\nSome people start to lose\nthat hypnotic ability.\nBy the time you're in your early 20s,\nyour hypnotizability\nbecomes extremely fixed.\nAnd there was a study done at Stanford,\nErnest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo\ndid this, looking at,\nthey've tracked down students\nwho were in psych one,\nhad their hypnotizability measured\nand retested them blindly 25 years later.\nAnd the test, retest correlation was,\nyou want to guess what it was?\n- I'm guessing it's, I\ndon't know, 0.6 something.\n- Yeah, very close.\nIt was 0.7, IQ would be 0.6,\non the 25 year interval.\n- Wow.\n- So, it's more stable than\nIQ over a 25 year interval.\nSo, once you're at that\npoint, that's where you are.\nWhat are the factors that lead to that?\nWell, and so what it means is that,\nabout a third of that adults\nare just not hypnotizable.\nTwo thirds are,\nabout 15% are extremely hypnotizable\nand we can measure that\nand give it a number\nfrom 0 to 10.\nAnd that's very useful.\nFor some of my patients when I do it,\nI say, look, I'm sorry,\nyou're not hypnotizable\nbut we're going to do something else.\nMedication, systematic desensitization,\nmindfulness, other things\nor if they're very\nhypnotizable, I just go for it.\nI don't do a lot of explaining.\nPeople who are low to\nmoderate hypnotizable,\nlike explanations about what you're doing,\nbut then they can still get the benefits.\nSo, it helps me guide the\nnature of my treatment\nwith these people.\nNow, the eye roll is,\nmy father used to use an\neye fixation induction,\nhe used to say, look up at the ceiling\nand now close your eyes\nwhile you're looking up.\nYou're very, yes,\nyou're very-\n- Yeah [indistinct] [laughs].\n- He noticed he had two\npatients back to back.\nAnd one was a woman who\nI'd seen him work with,\nwho had hysterical seizures.\nShe would just suddenly start shaking.\nAnd-\n- Real epileptic seizures?\n- No, pseudo epileptic seizures.\n- I see, so hysteria.\n- Hysteria, and although\nsome people have both,\nthat is the,\nfor some people, real\nepilepsy becomes a framework\nthat gets elaborated on,\nfor when you're stressed,\nyou have seizures.\nShe just had pseudo epilepsy,\nno EEG abnormalities.\nAnd she was really something to watch.\nHer husband had to move his\nwork bench near the door,\nso that if she started to have a seizure,\nhe could run home and\ntry and help her with it.\nIt was that bad.\nAnd he noticed that when\nshe did what you did,\nwhen she looked up,\nwhen she would have one\nof her seizure events,\nall you see is sclera, you\ndon't see Iris anymore.\nAnd she would start to seize.\nSo he did a great thing with her.\nHe taught her to have seizures.\nEverybody else was telling her to stop.\nHe made her have one.\nSo he hypnotized her,\n[indistinct] let's go back\nto the last time you had one\nand sure enough, she'd start to shake.\nAnd gradually he'd make\nthem smaller and smaller.\nSo, she was learning she could control,\nshe'd have access, it's like with PTSD,\nyou confront, you don't avoid\nit, you don't suppress it.\nYou confront it and figure\nout how to deal with it.\nThe next patient he had was a\nrigid obsessional businessman\nwho wanted to stop being so controlling\nand all this [chuckles], it reminded me,\nthere was a New Yorker\ncartoon of a driver,\nwho comes to a yield sign\nand he yells, \"Never!\"\nIt's always [indistinct].\n- That sounds about right,\nyou're a New Yorker.\n- Yeah, I'm a New Yorker.\nAnd so, this guy, when\nhe tried to look up,\nhe couldn't keep his eyes\nup while he closed them.\nAnd so, my father started testing people.\nAnd it seemed that there\nis a rough correlation\nbetween the capacity to keep your eyes up,\nwhile you closed them and\nmeasured hypnotizability.\n- So that people who are\nlistening [stutters],\nand watching on video.\nSo, the Spiegel Eye-Roll Test,\ninvolves looking up at the ceiling.\nSo, it's tilting the head back,\nI'm tilting my chin back and\nlooking up at the ceiling now.\nBut I'm also directing my eyes\nupward and my eyes are open.\nAnd then the eye roll test involves then,\nclosing the eyelids\nwhile the eyes are open.\n- Are open.\n- And whether or not,\nthe eyes roll back and as you said it,\nthen you see sclera,\nthe white part.\n- You see sclera,\nthe white part.\n- That means you're,\nvery hypnotizable\nor moderately hypnotizable.\n- Right.\n- Whereas if the eyes move\ndown and you see iris,\nthe colored part of the\neye as the eyes close,\nless hypnotizable.\n- Right.\n- So you can look this up online there,\nyou just put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test\nand you'll find it.\nAnd we are also going to do\nan actual example of hypnosis\non video later.\n- Right.\nSo, you're asking the brain\nto do something difficult,\nto keep the eyes up while\nclosing the eyelids.\nAnd so that's contradictory signals\nfor the third, fourth and\nsixth cranial nerve nuclei\nthat control eye movement.\n- You said the third-\n- Fourth and six,\n- Yup.\n- cranial nerve nuclei.\nAnd so you're suspending one activity,\nwhile asking them to do another\nand eye movements have a lot to do\nwith levels of consciousness.\nThe periaqueductal gray,\nsurrounds these cranial nerve nuclei.\nAnd when we close our eyes when we sleep,\nwe have rapid eye movement when we dream.\nMost drugs, that affect\nlevel of consciousness,\ncan affect eyes and eye movements,\neither the dilation or\ncontraction of the pupils,\ndepending on whether it's\na stimulant or an opioid.\n- Stimulants, make the pupils big.\n- Big, right?\n- Yeah.\nLike cocaine, amphetamine.\n- Right, exactly.\n- Things that sort.\n- And opioids,\nyou get constricted pupils.\n- This is what the parents looking\nat their kids coming in\nthe door late at night,\nthey're looking for substance abuse.\n- That's right.\n- Yeah.\n- So, there's something about the eyes\nthat has a lot to do with\nlevel of consciousness.\nI mean, obviously, you close\nyour eyes when you go to sleep,\nyou have rapid eye movement\nwhen you're dreaming.\nSo, it's not surprising.\nAnd there's an old Zen practice called,\nlooking at the third eye.\nAnd I think part of the\nreason that this happens is,\nwhere you're looking up inside\nit's like there's a third eye\nbetween the other two in your forehead.\nAnd I think it's because\nwe are visual creatures,\nwe're pretty pathetic from\na physical point of view.\nMany animals can outrun us,\nor outs smell us or eagles\ncould read the newsprint\nat a hundred yards and we can't.\nSo, our major defensive\nsensory input is vision.\nAnd that's why animals,\npredator animals have eyes\nin the front of their head,\nso that they have very good,\ndetailed vision of prey.\nWhereas prey animals like deer,\nhave eyes on the side of their head.\nSo, they don't see things that well,\nbut they have a much bigger range\nof potential to see threat.\nAnd we mainly use,\nand in fact, it's interesting,\nthere have been social\nanthropologists that say,\nwhy do we gather where we do,\non coastlines and at the edge\nof a forest or something,\nit's because you've got\nprotection in the back.\nSomething can attack you from one side\nand you have a big vision\nof what might threaten you.\nAnd we tend to be attracted\nto those kinds of physical situations, so-\n- Yeah, we love vistas.\n- We love vistas, that's right.\n- Vistas are very calming.\nThey take us into that panoramic vision.\n- That's right.\n- I didn't know this,\nbut it turns out that\nmost of the scenic spots\nat any location in national parks\nand where people naturally\naggregated it was-\nwhich makes sense.\n- Sure.\n- But, that those signs and\nlocations were built up around,\npeople's tendency and animals tendencies.\n- Oh, really [indistinct]?\n- To aggregate there.\nYeah, there's a interesting book\non the history of the\nnational parks that says,\nthat they didn't give a\nresearch study to support it,\nbut there was no Google Maps, obviously.\n- That's very interesting.\n- Yeah, panorama\nand visual boundaries\nare really interesting.\nI think, so the eyes, as we both know,\nare two pieces of the\ncentral nervous system\nof the brain, outside the-\n- Right.\nI used to say that the\neyes are outside the skull\nand a neuro-ophthalmologist wrote to me\nand vehemently pointed out\nthat they are outside the\ncranial vault, so, you know.\nThey're outside the cranial vault\nbut they are two pieces of\nbrain they're out there.\nAnd so, you mentioned cranial\nnerves, three, four and six.\nThis isn't a neuroanatomy course\nbut maybe we could go\na little deeper there.\nSo, you said there's\ncontradictory activity,\nlooking up is controlled by\nthe one set of cranial nerves.\nAnd then the closing of the eyelids,\nis controlled by another cranial nerve.\n- No, it's the same one.\nI think it's six that\nwhen you close your eyes,\nyou activate,\nno, it's the facial, I\nguess it's the facial nerve.\nIt's 7, yeah.\n- 7, yeah.\n- But you're looking up,\nyou're activating the muscles\nthat force your eyes to look up.\nAnd closing your eyelids\nnormally relaxes those,\nit relaxes that upper movement,\nbecause your eyes are closed\nand you don't need to do it.\nSo you're breaking a\nusual customary pattern.\n- It's like the rubbing the,\n- Right.\n- hey, I can't even do it,\nsee it's like the,\n- Right.\n[Andrew and David laughing]\n- That's exactly right.\n- Rubbing your tummy\nand patting your head.\nThere's a bit of a conflict there,\n- Right.\n- But clinically,\nit's been a good probe for you,\n- It has.\n- and for your father.\nSo, was it Spiegel senior\nor Spiegel junior?\n- That's Spiegel senior.\n- That developed The\nSpiegel Eye-Roll Test.\n- But the key issue is this,\nthat normally when we close our eyes also,\nwe're going to sleep.\nYou're not worried about\nwhat's going on in the world anymore.\nHere, you're maintaining\nresting alertness.\nSo, you're focusing but\nyou're turning inward.\nThat's an unusual state.\nNormally we close our eyes\nperiodically, we have to,\nbut when you close your eyes\nfor some period of time,\nit's normally to go to sleep\nand you're not worried about\ndetecting risk or threat.\nSo, it's an interesting state\nbecause you're turning inward, basically,\nyou're looking up,\nyou're shutting your eyes\nand you're allowing whatever\nhappens outside you to happen\nand focusing on what's going on inward.\nSo, I think it's a signal to\nyour brain to turn inward.\n- Very interesting.\nAnd meditation of course,\ncould be done with eyes open\nbut almost always is\ndone with eyes closed.\n- Yes, that's right.\n- Very interesting.\nSo, you can very quickly determine\nwhether or not someone\nis highly hypnotizable.\n- Right.\n- not at all hypnotizable.\nYou said about two thirds\nof people can be hypnotized.\n- Right.\n- Obviously a third cannot.\nBut within the two thirds that can,\nthere's a range,\nand you said 15% of people fall into this,\nhighly hypnotizable category.\n- Right, that's correct.\n- That I seem to be a member of.\n- Yeah.\n- And,\ndoes repeated use of self-hypnosis\nor clinical hypnosis,\nincrease or change hypnotizability,\nfor those that can access\nit in the first place?\n- I would say in general, it\nmay increase a little bit,\nbut not a hell of a lot,\nand it's not worth the effort\nto increase your\nhypnotizability at that point.\nIt's worth trying to\ndeal with the problem,\nyou're dealing with.\nSo, you can get better\nat using it at the level that you have.\nThere was a study done in which\nthey tried to train people\nto be more hypnotizable and obviously,\nthere're subjective and\nbehavioral components to the test,\nyou can learn to do a\nlittle better on them.\nBut what we found was when\nwe reanalyze this data,\nthat we could account for\nthree times the final score,\nbased on the initial\nhypnotizability measurement,\nrather than whether or\nnot they had been trained\nto do better.\nSo, you can improve it a little\nbut it's not worth the trouble.\n- Got it.\nAlong the lines of eyes and eye movements,\na lot of interest out there about EMDR,\nEye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing.\n- Yeah.\n- Shapiro herself was working,\nshe wasn't at Stanford directly,\nbut was the local to Stanford.\n- Yeah.\n- I think in Palo Alto.\n- MRI, yeah.\n- So what are your thoughts on EMDR?\nWhere is it useful, where do\nyou think it's less useful?\nAre there things that EMDR\ncould be combined with\nto make it more useful?\nThe listeners of this podcast come to,\nI think, come to the podcast\nwith a range of backgrounds\nand interests.\nTo me, it makes sense why EMDR,\nlateralized eye movements might work,\ngiven the newer data that it\ncan suppress amygdala activity\nin some animals and animal\nmodels and in humans as well.\nBut it really hasn't been\nexplored much, neurally.\nI've heard things like,\nit coordinates the two sides of the brain,\nwhich it, to me is just a throwaway.\nI don't think there's any evidence that,\ncoordinating the two sides of the brain\nis better than not coordinating.\nI wouldn't be speaking right now\nif the two sides of my brain,\nwere well correlated.\n- Yeah.\n- Because language is lateralized so,\n- Right, exactly.\n- I heard that it mimics,\nrapid eye movements during\nsleep, but actually it doesn't.\nSo,\n- Right.\n- But I have heard people talk\nabout their positive\nexperiences with EMDR.\nWhat are your thoughts about EMDR?\n- Yeah, you had a good comment on that\nin one of your recent podcasts.\nAnd I'll tell you,\none way I sort of think about it\nfrom a bemused point of view,\nis the old, you mentioned it earlier,\nthe oldest sort of idea\nof a hypnotic induction,\nwas a dangling watch, right?\nAnd [indistinct] watch.\nAnd, in fact, there was\nenough concern about it\nthat when automobiles were invented,\nthere was a movement to prevent\ninstalling windshield wipers\nbecause people were afraid\nthat they would be hypnotized,\nif they watched the windshield\nwipers go back and forth\non a car.\nNow, it turns out fortunately that,\nyou tend not to look at\nthe windshield wipers.\nYou keep looking through the windshield.\nAnd so, we have windshield wipers today.\nBut that movement is,\nwhat exactly used to be\na hypnotic induction.\nI think there is a lot\nof hypnosis in EMDR.\n- Ah.\n- And I think,\nit's a combination of that\nwith exposure based treatments,\nwhere you use EMDR to think about it.\nYou tend not to process\nthe experience as much\nand just do the physical part of it,\nwhich I personally think is a drawback.\nAnd, every study I've seen\nthat was a dismantling study.\nThere's no question that\npeople who go through EMDR,\nmany of them get better\nwith trauma related problems\nand the VA has a big\nprogram using it and so on.\nBut every program that has dismantled,\ngoing through the treatment\nwith having the lateral eye movement,\nhas shown that the lateral eye movement,\ndoesn't add anything to it.\nAnd toward the end of her career,\nFrancine was doing [indistinct]\ncontralateral touching\nor something, it wasn't\neye movements anymore.\nIt was other things.\nSo, I tend to think that,\nEMDR is another form of exposure\nbased therapy for trauma,\nbut as you've implied\nwith the exception of\nthis possible new data,\nit certainly doesn't have to do with,\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd I don't think moving\nthe eyes is the issue.\nI think it's a way of sitting\ndown and confronting trauma.\nAnd I would rather,\nthat the trauma itself\nbe processed a bit more\nthan often happens in EMDR.\nSo, a lot of people have gotten therapy.\nSome of them have been helped.\nFrancine used to originally claim\nthat just one session would\ndesensitize people and do it.\nAnd that's clearly not true.\nI see a lot of people who said,\nyeah, it helped for a\nwhile but I need more.\nSo, I think it became a kind of a,\noverly simplistic approach to\nunderstanding brain physiology\nand that part is wrong.\nAnd the interesting thing,\nyou mentioned suppressing\namygdala activity.\nIt's very interesting that,\nmy late friend Allen Hobson,\nwho was a brilliant sleep researcher,\nyou know Alan-\n- Sleep researcher.\nWell, I don't know him,\nbut I read his book when I was in college\nabout the chemistry of sleep.\n- Right.\nAnd the similarities between dream states\nand hallucinations.\n- Yes.\n- And it's one of the reasons\nI got into this business.\n- Yes, well, I worked with him\nin a MacArthur mind-body\nnetwork for many years.\n- Wow.\n- He was a brilliant guy,\npoints out that we need to get into,\nprimarily a parasympathetic\nstate to go to sleep,\nthat we have to shut off the\nsympathetic nervous system.\nAnd that's why a loud noise wakes you up,\nwhen your heart rate goes up and all this.\nSo, he was brilliant at documenting\nwhat happens in the brain at sleep.\nHe pointed out something also\nvery interesting about dreams,\nwhich is that the stories in dreams,\nand even the images in dreams\ncan change all over the place\nin crazy ways.\nBut usually the affect is constant,\nhe said, usually if it's\na frustration dream,\nwhatever happens, you end up frustrated.\nAnd if it's a enjoyment dream,\nyou enjoy whatever's going on.\nSo, there's an odd consistency\nand affect in dreams\nthat you don't have in other states.\nAnd the idea of lateral eye movement,\nsuppressing amygdala activity\nwould kind of fit with that,\nthat you don't allow intrusions\nof fear and anger and upset in dreams.\nIt may be there all the time,\nbut it may not be there\nwhen you think it should be.\nSo, why is it that you can\nbe falling off a building\nand somehow not that scared,\nyou're just having this\nexperience of flying in a dream.\nSo, I think there may\nbe something going on\nabout regulating affect, but there are,\nwe have elaborated better\nways to regulate affect.\n- Great, so EMDR,\nmight incorporate some\nelements of hypnosis,\nso the lateralized eye movements,\nperhaps by way of\nsuppressing the amygdala,\nthis fear associated center,\nmight bring people into a more\nparasympathetic calm state.\nSo, it might be pseudo hypnosis,\nand then an exposure therapy\nthrough the discussion about the issue.\n- Right.\n- Okay.\nMore research needed on EMDR out there.\nAnd obviously,\nsomething that's come up\na lot in this discussion\nand in our discussions that,\nhave the great fortune of\ntalking to you every week is,\nand working together is,\nthis idea of getting close to the phobia,\ngetting close to the trauma,\nre-experiencing it as a portal\nto then adjusting the response\nto it and rewiring something.\nSo, the troubling thing\nor the horrible thing is no\nlonger as horrible to us.\nbut the repeating theme is we can't expect\nto get over something without\ngetting really close to it.\nMaybe even experiencing it somatically.\nNowadays, we hear a lot about,\ntriggers and trigger warnings.\nAnd certainly, one can\nunderstand why those exist,\nbut it seems like in\nthe general population,\nthere's this idea that\nwe want to move away\nfrom anything that upsets us and yet,\n- Right.\n- I think it's fair to say,\neven though I haven't\ngathered the statistics that,\non the whole,\nthat human beings are\nbecoming more and more anxious\nand more and more stressed,\nperhaps because of but\ncertainly in parallel,\nwith the fact that we're\ntrying to move away\nfrom troubling things.\nSo, I've heard you say before,\nthat in terms of therapeutic approaches,\nit's not just about\nthe state you get into,\nbut whether or not you brought\nyourself there voluntarily.\n- That's exactly right.\n- So, this element of\ndeliberate self exposure,\ndeciding I'm going to confront the trauma,\nI'm going to confront the pain.\nI'm going to confront the insomnia.\nI'm going to confront the, you know,\nand fill in the blank.\nAnd then readjusting\none's emotional response,\nright up next to that troubling thing.\nThat seems to be the\nhallmark of this treatment.\nAnd,\nif I'm thinking about it correctly,\nof pretty much all treatments\nfor getting over stuff.\nIf people don't have access\nto a really good clinician, like yourself,\nhow should they carry these\nthoughts and these ideas?\nI mean, I think almost\neverybody of any reasonable age,\nhas memories or things that upset them,\nbut we learn to suppress them.\nWhat does one do?\nObviously, the Reveri app has approaches\nto dealing with some of\nthis, inside of the app,\nbut how does one start to think about,\nactually dealing with something like this\nand avoiding the hazards\nof just kind of reactivating\na lot of painful experiences?\nBecause a lot of being\na functional human being\nis also going to work each day,\ninteracting with people and\nnot bringing one's trauma,\nand dumping it out all on the table\nor being able to just\nfunction is so crucial.\nSo, how do you think\nabout this as a clinician?\n- Well, the image it comes to mind\nis the Greek myth of Pandora's Box.\nThat it opened and the Furies got out\nand you couldn't put 'em back in.\nAnd we have this kind of fantasy\nthat once you get into these memories,\nthey'll take you over\nand you'll never get them back in the box.\nAnd I think that's wrong.\nPeople who use hypnosis say that,\nthere are ways to present things to people\nthat will be helpful and ways that won't.\nAnd one real mistake is to tell someone,\ndon't think about purple elephants.\nWhat are you thinking about?\n- Purple elephants.\n- It doesn't work.\nSo, you want to find a way to\nfeel in control of the access\nand to define what\nhappened on your own terms.\nAnd so, I'm not a big\nfan of trigger warnings.\nI think we're going crazy over,\nthis could be upsetting,\nthat could be upsetting.\nYeah, there are lots of\nthings that are upsetting.\nThe average kid has\nwatched 20,000 murders,\nby the time he's 20 years old,\nwatching television and movies these days.\nSo, we see terrible things\nand it's not a matter of,\nare you exposed to\nsomething that's upsetting,\nbut how do you handle it?\nWhat do you make of it and\nare you feeling in control?\nIt's not like,\nwhat Putin is doing to\nhis rival in Russia,\nforcing him to watch propaganda\nmovies 10 hours a day,\nwhile he is in prison.\nIt's a matter of thinking about a problem,\nin a way that leaves you\nfeeling, you understand better.\nYou're in more control, you\ncan turn it off when you want,\nyou can turn it on when you want.\nAnd so we have to, in life,\ndeal with stressful things,\nthere are studies,\nKaren Parker at Stanford has\ndone some wonderful studies\nwith primates about stress inoculation.\nThat if you separate a\nbaby monkey from his mother\nfor two hours a day and then reunite them,\nand then you stress\nthat baby monkey later,\nthey actually handle stress better.\nThere's less cortisol arousal\nin the face of distress,\nstress inoculation, that's been called.\nSo, mere exposure to trauma or stress.\nIt's a part of living anyway.\nWe can't avoid it, even if we'd like to,\nand,\nit's not pleasant, it's not great\nbut it's sometimes things\nyou need to learn about life.\nAnd if you can find an\nalgorithm for facing it,\nputting it into perspective,\ndealing with it,\nyou become a stronger\nperson not a weaker person.\nSo, this idea that,\ncollege students are such fragile flowers,\nthat if you talk about a\nsexual assault or something,\nyou're doing something terrible to them,\nit's just wrong.\nAnd I think we need to build our ability\nto recognize and manage stress.\nAnd you can't do that without doing it.\nYou can't ride a bicycle\nwithout taking the risk of falling off it.\nAnd so, I think that's the way,\nI think of dealing with stress.\n- Yeah, I really\nappreciate you saying that.\nYou and I were both at a gathering,\nlet's say where this\nissue was being discussed,\nand around an issue of a\npublicized sexual trauma.\nAnd you made an excellent case\nfor why this stuff can't\nbe pushed under the rug.\nAnd that actually, in my observation,\nled to a lot of healing\nfor the people that\nand the families of people\nthat suffered from this.\nI do think people are resilient.\nBut we don't really teach\nhow to think about feelings.\nWe're told that we need\nto feel our feelings,\nbut then again, we are also told\nthat feelings don't hold\nall the information.\nAnd so, I think that as you mentioned,\nthere's no operating or users manual\nfor this nervous system thing.\nBrings me to another issue,\nwhich is the mind-body connection.\nSomething that we're very interested in\nand you've done extensive work on.\nWe all like to think that,\ngetting more in touch with our body,\nwould be a great thing,\nlearning to interocept,\npaying attention to\nour internal landscape,\nwould be a great thing.\nBut as we often discuss,\nwhen we're feeling lousy,\nthen being really in touch\nwith that lousy feeling,\nmay or may not be a good thing, right?\nSo, how should we think about mind-body?\nI can see examples in hypnosis,\nfrom your descriptions of hypnosis,\nwhere you want to unify\nthe mind-body connection.\nFeel what you're thinking,\nthink what you're feeling, et cetera.\nBut I could also point to elements\nwithin the hypnotic process\nin which you are actively\ntrying to uncouple those.\n- That's.\n- So, it sounds to me like,\nthis whole mind-body thing\nis a bit more like a car.\nYou can't say that 40 miles\nper hour is the optimal speed.\nIt kind of depends on the road you're on\nand the turn you may or may not be taking.\n- Right.\n- How should we think about\nmind-body in terms of,\nnavigating daily life?\nWhat do you think is the adaptive way,\nto conceptualize the mind-body?\nIt's a big question.\n- It is.\nIt's a very interesting one.\nI guess, I think that\nit's a matter or not of,\nabsolute control but more control,\nthat we need to think\nof our brain as a tool\nand our body's signals as tools as well,\nto help us understand what's\ngoing on in the world,\nwhat we need, what matters,\nwhat's important, what isn't,\nbut also something that can be managed,\nnot simply absorbed.\nAnd so, hypnosis I think\nis a kind of limiting case,\nwhere you can push it about\nas far as we can push it\nin terms of regulating pain.\nPain is a good example of that.\nObviously, you need to pay attention.\nIf you just broke your ankle,\nyou better pay attention\nto it and get help\nor you're having crushing\nsubsternal chest pain.\nYou better do something about it.\nBut our brain,\nis sort of programmed to\ntreat all pain signals\nas if they were novel pain signals.\nIf it's a sudden new problem\nthat needs to be attended to.\nI teach people to think of\nthe pain and categorize it,\ndoes the pain mean that\nif you put weight on this,\nyou're going to re-injure\nyour ankle for example,\nor does it simply mean\nthat your body is healing\nand the pain is a sign that,\ngradually things are\ngetting back to normal\nand so, you can modify\nthe way you process pain,\nbased on what your brain\ntells you the pain means.\nAnd that's true for\nemotional pain as well.\nAnd particularly where I think\na strategy that really helps,\nis if you think of an\ninterpersonal problem\nor a threat of something\ncoming as an opportunity\nto do something to\nameliorate the situation.\nSo, it's not just it's happening to you,\nbut something that you can\ninfluence and do something about.\nSo, it's blending the receptive\nwith the active response,\nthat I think can make a difference.\nSo, you try and process it in a way\nthat gives you a deeper\nunderstanding of what's happening.\nYou face it but you also say,\nthis is an opportunity for\nme to do something about it.\nAnd the minute you realistically enha-\nand this doesn't mean,\nimagine away a heart attack.\nIt means figure out how to\nrehabilitate from a heart attack\nor a broken leg or something like that\nin a way that you get as much control\ninto the situation as you can.\n- I love it.\nGrief.\nGrief is one of those\nstates that is very hard\nto remove oneself from.\nAnd a lot of people asked me,\nhow do I deal with grief?\nAnd I'm not a clinician\nso I'm deferring to you.\n- Mm-hm.\n- On the one hand,\nactually someone at Stanford\nrecently came to me and said,\nmy mother passed away and I\nhad a sibling that passed away\nand they were the only people that I had.\nAnd I'm also living alone\nand I'm challenged with\na number of things.\nAnd,\nthey looked like they\nwere holding it together,\n- Mm-hm.\n- very well, in fact,\ngiven what they were describing.\nAnd on the one hand,\nwell, I certainly pointed\nout that I'm not a clinician,\nbut I said on the one hand,\nyou could imagine that it\nwould be necessary and useful\nto go into the grief's state,\nif you want to transition through it.\n- Right.\n- On the other hand there,\nI've heard before that the cathartic model\nof just really diving into an emotion,\ncan also be potentially hazardous.\nIf you don't have any\nanchors to grab onto.\nWhat is view of psychiatry\nor your view of grief\nand how to deal with grief?\nBecause I think grief is,\none of those all encompassing\nemotions for many people.\n- Yeah, it is.\nAnd it's a very important,\nnatural, necessary stage of life.\nAnd the reason we have\nall these grief rituals\nfrom burials and memorials and headstones\nand sitting shiva and other\nthings that people do.\nIt's a way of making it real,\nthat an incomprehensible\nloss has to be comprehended.\nYou have to realize that you're\nnow going to have to live life\nwithout your loved one, your\nparent, your sibling, whoever.\nAnd we've all gone through\nthis at one time or another,\nI certainly have.\nAnd it's very hard to\njust come to terms with,\nbut one principle is to sort of say,\nit's never all or none, it's more or less.\nSo yes, it's all or none\nthat you've lost a loved one,\nbut I ask people as part of their grieving\nto say to themselves,\nand I do this in hypnosis sometimes too.\nYou've lost them but what\nhave they left you with?\nWhat have they bequeathed to\nyou even though they're gone?\nAnd I'll sometimes ask them to say,\nif your mother could be here right now,\nwhat would she say to you?\nHow would she feel about your life now?\nWhat would she advise you to do?\nSo, in our support groups\nfor women with advanced\nbreast cancer, we lost people.\nAnd I got to tell you that we\nwere warned by oncologists,\nthat we demoralized people that,\nI mean, they were wonderful oncologists,\nbut there are some that were very afraid\nthat we would harm them in some way,\nbecause the mortality rate is fairly high\nwith metastatic breast cancer.\nThey're going to watch people\ndie of the same disease\nand you'll demoralize them.\nSo, we actually measured their emotion\nand the content of\nspeech every five minutes\nthroughout a bunch of groups to make sure\nthat wasn't happening.\nWhat we found was,\nthat they talked about\nmore serious issues,\nbut the mood didn't actually get worse.\nAnd we found in general that\nexpressing negative emotion\non the long run helps\npeople be less anxious\nand depressed over time.\nAnd we've shown this in\nrandomized clinical trials.\nSo, it's not just my clinical impression.\nAnd what we try to get them to do,\nis to face a loss,\nlive with the emotion that comes with it\nbut also see that the\nreason it hurts so much,\nis how much that person gave you.\nSo, we would do a self-hypnosis exercise\nat the [indistinct] say,\nI want you to get your body\nfloating, safe and comfortable.\nNow, picture Mary and sit\nwith the feeling of sadness\nthat she's no longer with us.\nAnd we do that for a few minutes.\nAnd then we'd say on the other side,\npicture one thing she left\nwith you that you still have,\nthat you carry on in your heart,\nher tradition of what she gave to you.\nAnd so just seeing it,\nnot as a complete loss,\nbut as a real loss, a painful loss\nbut one that helps you to reflect on,\nwhat you gained from her and knowing her,\nI think can be very helpful\nin the grieving process.\n- That's very helpful\nway to conceptualize it.\nCouple quick questions.\nCan children be safely\nhypnotized or do self-hypnosis?\n- It's sometimes harder for\nthem to do self-hypnosis,\nthey need more structure to do it.\nYou've got to share your\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nwith 'em a little bit,\nbut yes, absolutely, children\ncan be very hypnotizable.\nAnd I know pediatricians,\nwho use it wonderfully all the time.\nThey get them to focus on something else.\nSo, they're going to\nhave to give them a shot\nor draw blood or something.\nAnd they'll say,\nI'm going to press your happy button\nand he presses their belly button.\nAnd they start to giggle the way kids do.\nAnd meanwhile, the nurse\nis drawing the blood\nand they don't even notice it.\nDentists, good dentists\ncan use it to help kids\nwith fear and pain.\nSo yes, it can be very\neffective for children.\nWe did a randomized trial.\nI have a publication in pediatrics,\nmy late sister, who was a pediatrician,\nand who always used to joke that,\nshe was the only one in our\nfamily who was a real doctor.\nI said, I gotcha.\nI got a paper in pediatrics\n[Andrew laughing]\nand the paper was children\nhaving to undergo,\na voiding cystourethrogram.\nSo, the anatomy of the kidney,\nif you'll forgive me, is\nsort of interesting in that,\nthe ureter that goes into the bladder,\nnormally goes into the\nbladder at an angle.\nAnd so that means,\nthat when the bladder\ncontracts to expel urine,\nit automatically closes off the ureter\nbecause it's sideways to the bladder.\nSome kids are born with it perpendicular,\nand then you'll get\nreflux into the kidney.\nAnd some children outgrow it,\nsome need pretty complicated\nsurgery to fix that.\nAnd so, you image them every year or so\nto see whether they're\ngetting kidney damage or not.\nAnd it's a pretty miserable experience.\nYou're a nine year old girl.\nYou have to go and lie\non a hard cold table,\nhave strangers pull your legs apart\nand stick a catheter into your urethra\nand hold in the bladder\nand then expel urine.\nAnd so, you get into\nthese struggling fights.\nAnd of course the more they struggle,\nthe more they constrict and\nit makes it harder to do it.\nSo, I was asked if we could test this.\nSo, we did a randomized\ntrial at children's hospital.\nThey either got training in self-hypnosis.\nI would meet with them and\nthe mother the week before,\nwe find out from the kids\nwhere they like to be.\nAnd I'd say, you're going to\nplay a trick on your doctors.\nYour body's there, you're somewhere else,\ngo visit your friend, go to\nDisneyland, do something else.\nAnd the mother would work on this with me\nat the head of the table.\nAnd we found that these children\nwere much easier to image.\nOne got so relaxed that, so\nyour guy [indistinct] he's said,\nnormally it takes us 10\nminutes to get them to pee\nafter they're doing this.\nShe was so relaxed, she started peeing\nbefore I could even get the\nbed pan under her [laughs].\nAnd I had to clean up the table.\nAnd they also, 17 minutes\nshorter procedures.\nAnd that's a long 17\nminutes for a little kid.\nSo, it can be very\neffective with children.\nThey're less anxious, they have less pain\nand get through these\ndifficult procedures very well.\n- That's great.\nHas hypnosis ever been done for couples,\nlike couples therapy?\nI'm thinking of pretty much\nevery clinical setting here.\nBoth people have to be hypnotizable,\nof course.\n- Mm-hm, yes.\n- But the reason I ask about this,\nis next, I'm going to\nask about psychedelics\nand there's a lot of interest in,\ncoordinating states through the use,\nof drugs of different kinds.\n- Mm-hm.\n- We actually do this when\nwe treat depression, right?\nYou have a depressed\nperson with family members\nwho are not depressed, and you say,\nwell, let's make them all\nnot depressed [chuckles],\n[David laughing]\nright, I mean,\nbut and I'm only half kidding there,\nbecause that is kind of the\nunderlying logic in some sense.\nBut are you aware of any of\nany coordinated hypnosis?\n- That's interesting, I mean,\nI've done plenty of it in\ngroups not with couples.\n- You can hypnotize large groups,\nat once?\n- Oh yeah.\n- Are we hypnotized right now?\n- Yeah, you are.\nAnd I hope you've been enjoying it.\n[Andrew laughing]\nBut the metastatic breast cancer,\nthere was a group of like 10 women,\nwho would meet once a week\nand we would all go\ninto hypnosis together.\n- I didn't realize that,\nyou were hypnotizing them collectively.\n- Yes, right.\n- Fascinating.\n- And that, if anything,\nI think it brings out the\nbest in people's abilities\nbecause it's a shared social experience\nand they would talk about it afterwards.\nAnd so, yes, that's\nabsolutely doable, yeah.\n- And I don't want to focus\non psychedelics specifically.\nMaybe that's a topic for a future episode.\nBut is there any basis\nfor combining hypnosis\nwith drug therapies inside\nof the hypnotic episode?\nSo, I realize that some patients of yours,\nmight be prescribed a antidepressant\nor a medication for some purpose,\nmaybe same or different\nthan the hypnosis is\nbeing directed toward.\nBut is there any evidence that,\nif people are relaxed through\nthe use of a propranolol\nor one of these many things\nin the psychiatrist's kit,\nthat hypnosis can be more effective?\n- Well, interestingly,\none study that I haven't mentioned is,\nwe did spectroscopy on\npeople who were hypnotized.\nAnd we found that,\nthere was a correlation\nbetween hypnotizability\nand GABA activity in the\nanterior cingulate cortex,\nwhich fits with turning down activity.\nTo the extent that we can self-medicate\nand GABA receptors basically are doing\nwhat benzodiazepines do to the brain,\nthat can happen when\npeople are hypnotized.\n- So you're saying inside of the hypnosis,\nyou have neural evidence that,\nthere's a kind of a\nsedative effect of hypnosis\nat the chemical level.\n- Yeah, right.\n- Amazing.\n- The people who are more hypnotizable,\nhave more of those GABA receptives\nand it's related to the degree\nof their hypnotizability.\n- Fascinating.\n- In terms of, there have been studies,\nwhere they give people\nmedications as well.\nAnd the interesting thing\nwith benzodiazepines,\nwhich activate inhibitory\nactivity in the brain.\nIf you are very anxious,\nit might improve your\nhypnotic response a bit.\nIf you're just so anxious\nand [indistinct] you can't do it.\nIf you're not very anxious,\nit actually inhibits hypnotic activity\nbecause you get sort of\nsedated and just out of it.\nAnd you can't focus\nyour attention, as well.\nSo, by and large,\nwe don't use drugs as an\nadjuvant to hypnotic experience.\nMost of the time you don't need to.\nAnd sometimes it can make\nit worse rather than better.\nThere's some evidence that,\nmild stimulants might enhance\nhypnotic responsiveness,\na little reliably, but too much,\nWell, [indistinct] scatter attention\nand you'll have less control over it.\nSo, they might be adjuvants,\nbut I frankly think hypnosis\nis more of a replacement\nthan a need of supplementation.\n- Your laboratory and my laboratory have,\nwell, have sort of snuck into your lab\nand then trying to emerge the two,\nit's been a lot of fun,\n- It sure has,\nbeen learning a lot about,\nthe power of respiration of breathing\nto shift brain states, not just\nduring breathing protocols,\nbut at all times.\nAnd we will do an entire\nepisode about those protocols.\nI think we,\n- Cool.\n- after those are published and so on.\nBut breathing itself is,\nyou've described as a bridge\nbetween conscious and unconscious states.\n- Right.\n- So, I have to ask,\nhow important is the\npatient's breathing pattern?\nHow closely are you monitoring\ntheir breathing pattern?\nHow closely do you monitor\nyour own breathing pattern\nas you're inducing hypnosis?\nPut simply, what is\nthe role of respiration\nin shifting the brain's state,\nduring a hypnotic protocol?\n- Yeah, that's very interesting.\nYou had a great show with Jack-\n- Yeah, Jack Feldman\n- Feldman.\n[Andrew indistinct]\nAnd he is.\nAnd the issue,\nI watch it,\nI try [stutters].\nThe work that we're enjoying\ndoing together shows\nthat there are breathing patterns\nthat may increase sympathetic\narousal or may decrease.\nIt may [indistinct]\ncyclic sighing seems to,\nactually, where you have\nmore time spent exhaling\nthan inhaling.\nAnd there's reason to believe\nthat it induces parasympathetic activity,\n'cause you're increasing\npressure in the chest\nand therefore allowing\nthe heart to slow down\nbecause blood is being returned\nto the atrium more easily.\nI do use it.\nI ask people to take a deep\nbreath as part of the induction\nand then slowly exhale.\nAnd partly as a result\nof our research together,\nI'm emphasizing this slow exhale more,\nas part of [stutters],\nto enhance the idea in the induction\nthat this is a period of relaxation,\n'cause I think they are inducing that\nand perhaps perceiving it as well.\nSo, there there's no,\nyou're absolutely right that\nbreathing is very interesting\n'cause it's right at the edge of conscious\nand Jack talked about that too,\nof conscious and unconscious control,\nthat it will go on automatically\nbut we can control it.\nAnd so, it's a kind of way\nfor us to demonstrate to ourselves,\ngreater ways of modulating\nour internal state.\nSo, you can either do it,\nthinking about it,\nthe way we do with pain\ncontrol in hypnosis\nor you can do it to some extent,\nby taking charge of your breathing\nand doing things that\nwill produce a change\nthat you want to see happen in your body.\nSo, I like it because\nit's right at that margin,\nwhere you can enhance,\nfor me, I like that as a\nway of augmenting hypnosis,\nmore than medication,\nI think this is a powerful\nway of doing that.\n- Great, I'm really excited\nto see where all of this goes.\n- Yes.\n- Breathing, vision,\nbodily states are clearly the-\nand directed mental focus,\nseem to be the key elements of hypnosis.\nAm I missing any other ingredients?\n- Yeah, I think that's right.\n- It's-\n- Breathing, vision,\n- Breathing, vision, how\nyou change your vision\nand you don't, you know,\ntypically you're in a\nphysically relaxed state,\nbut frankly there are people\nat the peak of performance,\nincluding physical athletic performance\nor musical performance when\nthey're in hypnotic states too.\nI've talked to classical pianists who say,\nI'm not thinking, if\nI start thinking about\nwhat my fingers are doing now, I screw up.\nI'm floating above the piano,\nthinking about the tone\nthat I want to feel exuding\nfrom the instrument.\nSo that's a hypnotic like state too.\nAnd many athletes who\nare in peak performance,\nare just flowing with it.\nThey're not thinking step\nby step, what am I doing?\nAnd that's when you're doing your best\nor when we're working\nor giving a talk and doing it well,\nwe're in a hypnotic like states.\nSo, it usually requires,\nbut doesn't necessarily\nrequire physical comfort\nor quietness.\nIt can sometimes be intense activity.\n- Incredible.\nWell, this has been an amazing discussion.\nI've learned so much as\nI always do from you.\nWhere can people learn more about,\nhow they can get hypnotized?\nWe mentioned Reveri,\nwe'll put a link to it,\nR-E-V-E-R-I.com is the way to access that.\n- Or it's the Reveri\napp from the app store,\nis the other way.\nreveri.com is the website,\nyou can get to it through that\nor download the Reveri\napp from the app store.\n- Great.\nSo, currently on apple,\nhopefully soon, also on Android,\nbut in the meantime,\nwhat if people are interested\nin exploring clinical hypnosis,\nworking with you or somebody similar?\nIs there a centralized resource\nthat people can go to to find,\nreally well-trained hypnotists?\n- There are two good\nprofessional organizations\nthat will help you with that.\nOne is the society for clinical\nand experimental hypnosis.\nAnd I think that's sceh.us is their-\n- Okay, we'll look it\nup and provide a link.\n- And the American society\nfor clinical hypnosis,\nand they both provide referral\nservices for professionals.\nYou can look it up.\nI would just say in general,\nlook for someone who\nis licensed and trained\nin their primary professional discipline,\npsychiatry, psychology,\nmedicine, dentistry\nand who has training and\ninterest in using hypnosis,\nis a way to do it.\n- Great and then one more\nquestion and then a comment.\nThe question is, will\nyou be my psychiatrist?\n- [laughs] I'm honored.\n- It's a tall task.\nI might be that the most stubborn patient.\n- I think the hardest work's\nalready been done, Andrew.\n- Thank you.\n- You're fine, now.\n- I appreciate that.\n[David laughing]\nWell, and the final thing is a comment.\nFirst of all,\nthank you so much for being here today,\nfor sharing your knowledge.\n- You're welcome.\n- I hope we can do it again and again.\n- I hope so.\n- I love working with your laboratory\nand with you.\n- Likewise [indistinct].\n- Because when you speak,\nI learn and I know others do as well.\n- Thank you.\n- We will put resources\nto get to you but I also just want to say,\nthank you for doing the work that you do.\n- Well, thank you.\n- It's an incredible thing\nthat in this world\nwhere we are discovering so\nmuch about how the body works,\nthe mind is still rather mysterious\nand people are struggling\nwith a lot of things,\nbut also I think people\nare really excited about,\napplying tools like\nhypnosis to perform better,\nfeel better mentally and physically.\nAnd so you've pointed us\nto a tremendous amount of resources\nand how these tools work\nand where they've already\nbeen demonstrated to work.\nSo just, thank you.\nI know this is your\nprofessional commitment in life\nand we all benefit.\nSo, thank you so.\n- Well, thank you,\nbut it's been a real joy for me\nto be collaborating with you\nand for you to be using your precision\nand knowledge about neuroanatomy,\nneurobiology to address problems\nthat often people who are that disciplined\nin the primary neurobiological end,\naren't as interested in as you are.\nAnd so, it's really been a pleasure\nto try and bring together\nwhat we both know\nfrom these different perspectives\nto build something that\nneither of us could do alone.\nAnd so, it's been a real\njoy for me to do it.\n- Thank you, I'm honored.\n- Thank you.\n- Thank you very much, David.\n- You're welcome.\n- Thank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel.\nI hope you found it as\nfascinating as I did.\nAnd if you'd like to see the video\nof Dr. Spiegel hypnotizing
