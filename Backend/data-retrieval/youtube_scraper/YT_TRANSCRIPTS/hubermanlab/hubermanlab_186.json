    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk about the psychology\nand the biology of desire,\nlove and attachment.\nToday happens to be Valentine's day, 2022.\nHowever, the themes we\nare going to discuss\npertain to desire, love and\nattachment on any given day.\nAnd indeed the mechanisms\nwe are going to discuss\nalmost certainly were at\nplay thousands of years ago,\nhundreds of years ago, and no\ndoubt will still be at play\nin our minds, and in our\nbodies, and in our psychologies\nfor the decades, centuries and\nthousands of years to come.\nIndeed today, I want to\nfocus on core mechanisms\nthat lead individuals to\nseek out other individuals\nwith whom to mate with,\nwith whom to have children with or not,\nwith whom to enter short\nor long-term relationships with,\nand for perhaps to end those relationships\nor to seek relationships on\nthe side, so-called infidelity.\nI'm certainly not going\nto encourage or discourage\nany of these behaviors.\nI'm simply going to cover the\npeer-reviewed scientific data\non all these aspects of\ndesire, love, and attachment.\nI'm going to discuss how our\nchildhood attachment styles,\nas they're called, influence\nour adult attachment styles.\nYes, you heard that right.\nHow we attached or did not\nattach to primary caregivers\nin our childhood has much\nto do with how we attach\nor fail to attach to\nromantic partners as adults,\nbecause the same neural circuits,\nthe neurons and their\nconnections in the brain and body\nthat underlie attachment\nbetween infant and caregiver,\nbetween toddler and\nparent or other caregiver,\nand during adolescence\nand in our teenage years\nare repurposed for adult\nromantic attachments.\nI know that might be a\nlittle eerie to think about,\nbut indeed that is true.\nNow the fortunate thing is that\nregardless of our childhood\nattachment styles and\nexperiences, the neural circuits\nfor desire, love and\nattachment are quite plastic.\nThey are amenable to\nchange in response to both\nwhat we think and what we\nfeel as well as what we do.\nHowever, all three aspects\nthat we're discussing today,\ndesire, love and attachment\nare also strongly biologically driven.\nWe're going to talk about\nbiological mechanisms\nsuch as hormones,\nbiological mechanisms\nsuch as neurochemicals,\nthings like dopamine,\noxytocin and serotonin,\nand neural circuits, brain\nareas, and indeed areas\nof the body that interact\nwith the brain that control\nwhether or not we desire somebody or not,\nwhether or not we lose\nor increase our desire\nfor somebody over time,\nwhether or not we fall in love,\nwhat love means, and whether\nor not the relationships\nwe form continue to include the elements\nof desire and love over time or not.\nIn order to illustrate just\nhow powerfully our biology\ncan shape our perception\nof the attractiveness\nof other people, I want to\nshare with you the results\nof a couple of studies.\nBoth studies explore\nhow people rate other\npeople's attractiveness.\nAnd in both studies, the\nmajor variable is that women\nare at different stages\nof their menstrual cycle.\nNow in the first study, men\nare rating the attractiveness\nof women according to\nthe smell of those women.\nNow they're not smelling them directly.\nThey're smelling clothing\nthat women wore for a couple\nof days at different phases\nof their menstrual cycle.\nAnd what they find is that men\nwill rate the odors of women\nas most attractive if those women wore\nthose shirts, that clothing,\nin the pre-ovulatory phase\nof their cycle, okay?\nSo this is not to say that men\ndo not find women attractive\nat other stages of their cycle.\nIt is to say that men find women's odors\nparticularly attractive, if\nthose odors were worn by women\nthat are in the pre-ovulatory phase\nof their menstrual cycle, okay?\nNow, there was also a study\nthat was done where women\nat different stages of\ntheir menstrual cycle\nare rating the odors of men.\nAnd a similar but mirror\nsymmetric result was found\nsuch that women who are\nin the pre-ovulatory phase\nof their menstrual cycle\nwill rate men's odors\nas more attractive than at\nother stages of their cycle.\nSo the simple way to put\nthis is that there seems\nto be something special\nabout the pre-ovulatory phase\nof a woman's menstrual cycle\nthat makes men rate them\nas more attractive during\nthat time and women rate men\nas more attractive during\nthat particular time as well.\nSo this is a bidirectional effect.\nThe way that the second study was done,\nwhere women are rating men was\nnot just to smell the odors\nof those men on t-shirts, they did that,\nbut they correlated\nthat with whether or not\nthe shirts were worn by men\nthat were particularly\nphysically symmetrical.\nThey actually had these\nmen divided into groups.\nIt was more of a continuum rather,\nrated according to body\nsymmetry and face symmetry.\nAnd women preferred more symmetrical men\nwhen they were doing the preference test\nduring the pre-ovulatory\nphase of their cycle.\nSo again, the point is\nthat that pre-ovulatory\nphase of the cycle seems to create\na bidirectional mutual attractiveness.\nNow, also extremely\ninteresting is that this effect\ndoes really seem to have\nsomething to do with ovulation.\nBecause in both studies,\nthey had women that were taking\noral contraception or not.\nAnd what they found was\nif a woman is taking\noral contraception, it prevented\nthat peak and perceived\nattractiveness by the men,\nmeaning men no longer perceived\na woman to be more attractive\nat a particular phase of their cycle.\nAnd also women taking oral\ncontraception no longer preferred\nthe odors of more symmetrical men\nduring the pre-ovulatory\nphase of their cycle.\nNow, I want to make sure\nthat it's especially clear\nthat it is not the case that\noral contraception reduced\nthe perception of a woman as attractive,\nthat did not happen in these studies.\nIt reduced the further\nincrease in a male's perception\nof her as attractive.\nAnd if women took oral contraception,\nit prevented them from\npreferring more symmetrical men\nbased on the odors of those men.\nNow I realize there are\na lot of variables here.\nWe've got odors, we've got symmetry,\nwe've got menstrual cycle,\npre-ovulatory, non pre-ovulatory.\nAnd we have whether or not people\nare taking contraception or not.\nBut the basic finding is that\ndepending on where women are\nin their menstrual cycle,\ninfluences both men's perception\nof them as attractive and\ntheir perception of men\nas attractive and oral contraception\neliminates that effect.\nSo I share with you those\ndata to illustrate that\nwe often think that somebody\nis attractive or not based on,\nI don't know, how they look,\ntheir skin, their hair, et cetera,\nbut it also illustrates that\ntheir odor is a powerful cue\nfor some people more than others.\nSome of us tend to be more\nfactory driven than others.\nAlthough if you watched the\n\"Huberman Lab Podcast\" episode\nthat I did with Professor David Buss\nfrom the University of Texas, Austin,\nwho's a luminary in the field\nof evolutionary psychology\nand has studied mate choice\nand mate selection bias over decades,\nhe's really one of the\nfounders of that field,\nhe emphasized findings\nthat odor for many people\nis a maker or a deal breaker.\nMeaning, there are some people\nthat even if somebody has\nall the characteristics that\nthey're looking for in terms\nof kindness, and\nattractiveness, and values,\nand other features that\nwould and should be\nof very high priority in selecting a mate,\nthat if someone does not like\nthe way that person smells,\ntheir innate body odor\nindependent of colognes,\nand perfumes, and soaps, et cetera,\nthat that's often a complete\nand total deal breaker.\nI'm sure there are some of\nyou that can relate to that.\nAnd there's some of you\nperhaps for which that is\nnot the case, and you can't\neven imagine that being\nsuch a powerful variable.\nAnd yet the data suggested\nindeed it is a powerful variable\nfor many people out there.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nNow nootropics is not a word\nthat I'm usually a fan of,\nbecause nootropic means smart drug.\nAnd there are a lot of different aspects\nto being smart or to intelligence.\nThere's the ability to focus.\nThere's the ability to task switch.\nThere's the ability to be creative.\nAnd each of those different\nforms of intelligence\nor expressions of intelligence involves\ndifferent brain circuits,\ndifferent neurochemicals,\nand indeed different hormones in the body.\nSo I think it's rather naive to think that\nthere could be one\nsmart drug or nootropic.\nThesis understands this.\nAnd so they've developed custom\nnootropics that are tailored\nto the specific goals that you might have\nin terms of cognitive\nwork, or physical exercise,\nor skill learning of any kind.\nAnd they tailor them to the individual.\nThey only use the highest\nquality ingredients,\nmany of which I've talked\nabout here on the podcast.\nThings like alpha GPC,\nwhich I personally use,\nthings like phosphatidylserine,\nwhich I also use on occasion.\nHowever, they've taken\ndifferent combinations\nof those ingredients and\nput them into different\nformulations designed for\nparticular goals or endpoints.\nFor instance, I have Thesis nootropics\nthat are for motivation,\nothers that are for clarity,\nfor mental clarity, others\nthat I take pre-workout,\nothers that I take post-workout,\nand so on and so forth.\nNow, in addition to that\nThesis understands that\nnot every ingredient is\nterrific for everybody.\nIn fact, one particular\nsubstance that I've talked about\non the podcast, Ginkgo\nbiloba is very useful\nfor a lot of people.\nHowever, I don't tolerate it well.\nI get vicious headaches\nfrom Ginkgo biloba.\nSo none of the formulations\nthat they've made\nfor me include Ginkgo biloba.\nSo again, these are custom\nnootropics that are tailored\nfor your particular goals,\nand where the ingredients really match\nyour particular needs,\nand don't include things that\naren't going to work for you,\nor that create things like headaches.\nSo the personalization\nand the targeted effects\nof the nootropics is really\nwhere or the power comes from.\nI've been using Thesis nootropics\nfor close to six months now.\nAnd I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nhave been a total game changer for me.\nMy go-to formula is\nthe motivation formula.\nIf I'm going to be\ntraining, or working out,\nor I need extra energy,\nand I use the clarity formula nowadays\nfor any kind of writing or creative work.\nThose are the two that I've\nmainly been taking lately.\nIf you want to try your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit, you can go online\nto takethesis.com/huberman.\nYou'll take a three minute\nquiz and Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas to\ntry in your first month.\nYou'll have the ability to\ntry those different blends\nacross that month,\ndiscover which nootropics\nwork best for you, your unique\nbrain chemistry in genetics.\nYou can have a consult with them,\nand then they will give you\nthe best nootropics for you.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto gain 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nNow called AG1.\nI've been taking AG1 since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1\nand the reason I still take\nAG1 once or twice a day\nis that it covers all of my\nvitamin mineral probiotic needs.\nProbiotics are essential because\nthey support what's called\na healthy gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome is\nvital for things like\nmetabolism, hormone function,\nand also we now know our brain function,\nthings like focus and memory\nand our general immune system.\nWith AG1, I get the probiotics I need,\nI get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need\nto cover any nutritional gaps,\nif I'm not eating optimally.\nAnd even if I am eating\noptimally, AG1 can further support\nmetabolism, hormone function, et cetera.\nIn fact, whenever people ask me,\nwhat's the one supplement\nthat I should take\nif I can only take one supplement?\nI always say AG1.\nI take mine early in the day.\nI mix it with water and\nsome lemon or lime juice.\nI love the way it tastes.\nAnd I'll take it again later in the day,\ntypically in the late afternoon.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThey're giving you five free travel packs\nthat make it really easy to mix up AG1\nwhile you're on the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera, and a\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nThere's a ton of data now\nsupporting the fact that\nvitamin D3 is critical and that\nmost of us don't get enough\nvitamin D3 even if we're\ngetting ample sunlight.\nVitamin D three is\nimportant from metabolism,\nhormone function, brain function,\nand many other aspects of our biology.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can get a special offer\nof the Athletic Greens,\nfive free travel packs and the\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done.\nFor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat influence your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be discovered\nfrom a quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get information\nfor instance about\nhow your biological age compares\nto your chronological age,\nwhich of course is a vital measurement.\nNow, one of the major issues\nwith blood tests and DNA tests\nout there is that people\nget the information back\nthat lipid marker of one\ntype, it might be high or low,\nor that a hormone of another\ntype might be high or low,\nbut they don't give\nyou any for information\nabout what to do with that information.\nInside Tracker makes that\nall very easy to navigate.\nOnce you get your results back,\nyou can click on any of those results.\nAnd Inside Tracker will\nimmediately show you things\nthat you can do, for\ninstance, with your nutrition,\nor supplementation, or lifestyle factors\nto help you bring those\nnumbers into the ranges\nthat are appropriate for you.\nSo it's immensely\npowerful, not just in terms\nof the measurements, but also\nit provides some directives\nthat can help bring those\nmeasurements into the ranges\nthat are best for your\nimmediate and long-term health.\nIf you'd like to try Inside Tracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInside Tracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at

further.\nOf course, we can have many\ndifferent kinds of loves.\nThere's romantic love,\nthere's love of family,\nso-called familial love,\nthere's love of pets.\nWe can even love objects,\nwhere we can feel as if we love objects.\nWe can love certain activities.\nWe can have friends that we\nlove and so on and so forth.\nThe word love is used to encompass\na lot of different types of relationships.\nToday, we are mainly going to\nbe focused on romantic love\nand the neural mechanisms\nof romantic love.\nI want to acknowledge here at the outset\nthat most of the studies of romantic love\nhave focused on monogamous\nheterosexual love.\nAnd also when we talk about\nstudies focused on desire,\nand attractiveness, and\nattachment, that's also the case.\nAnd that simply reflects the\ngeneral bias of the literature\nover the last 50 to 100 years.\nIt does, of course, not\nrule out that similar\nor different mechanisms could be at play\nin non-monogamous relationships,\nin homosexual relationships,\nor in relationships of\nany kind or variation.\nIt's also worth us defining\nour terms around desire.\nIt can mean lust, it can mean the desire\nfor long-term partnership.\nSo we need to define our\nterms and throughout I will do\nmy best to very carefully\ndefine what I mean by desire,\nwhat I mean by love, and\nwhat I mean by attachment.\nThe formal study of love,\nand desire, and attachment\ngoes back to the early 1900s.\nOne of the classic studies\non this is entitled\n\"Love and Desire.\"\nIt was published in\n1912 and really focused\non two opposing themes within romance.\nOne is love which in that paper\nwas really meant to include\nattachment and dependence\nor interdependence\nbetween individuals, right?\nAnd the other end of the\nspectrum being desire,\nor the sexual desire for another.\nAnd romance was meant to\nencapsulate both those things,\nlove and desire.\nAnd for much of the 1900s,\nit was thought that love\nand desire were on opposing\nends or in a push pull.\nAnd it was the dynamic push and\npull between love and desire\nthat one could define romance.\nAnd that actually led to\nmuch of what's out there\nin the psychological literature.\nToday, we are going to explore\nsome neurobiological studies,\nsome studies of the endocrine system,\nmeaning the hormone system\nthat actually support that general model.\nAnd I'll point you toward what\nI think is a very useful book\nin thinking about how relationships\ncan both form and last\nover long periods of time\nand how those relationships\ncan include both desire\nand interdependence.\nI'll also talk about some\nstudies that have really focused\non why relationships\nsucceed and why they fail,\nand how that relates to whether\nor not there is sufficient\namounts of attachment and desire.\nSo today we're going to\ntalk about the science\nand indeed you'll also get some tools.\nThose tools should be useful\nto you, whether or not\nyou happen to be in a relationship or not,\nwhether or not you're seeking\na relationship or not.\nI'd like to begin with an anecdote.\nAnd this is not an anecdote\nabout my relationship history,\nit's an anecdote about\nmy scientific history.\nWhen I started graduate school,\nthe chairman of the department\nI was in at the time\nsaid to me, \"Most PhDs last\nlonger than most marriages.\"\nAnd indeed he was right.\nAnd also most marriages in\nthis country end in divorce.\nI think it's about 50% with a\nslight skew toward more ending\nin divorce than persist\nuntil death do them part.\nBut nonetheless, it's about half,\nand most marriages end before\nthe eight-year period is up.\nMost PhDs take anywhere\nfrom four to nine years.\nSo there was a bit of a\nsmearing of averages there,\nbut the point he was trying to make\nreally landed home for me.\nIt did not scare me out of relationships\nnor did it scare me out\nof a PhD, obviously.\nWhat it did illustrate\nwas that there's something\nabout our attachment machinery\nthat can be very, very compelling,\nsuch that people take on\ntremendous levels of commitment.\nI have to imagine that\nmost people enter marriages\nassuming that they're going\nto stay in those marriages.\nI don't think most people\nenter marriages thinking\nthey're going to get divorced.\nBut that if 50% of those\ncommitments end in divorce,\nthere must also be mechanisms\nby which our attachments can break.\nAnd today we're going to\ntalk about both the forming\nof attachments and the\nbreaking of attachments,\nwhat can prevent those\nbreaks in attachments,\nand indeed what can\nlead to re-attachments.\nThere are biological\nmechanisms to desire, love\nand attachment, that's abundantly clear.\nNow there's a robust and\nvery large literature\nin animal models.\nWhat I mean by that are field\nstudies and laboratory studies\nin primates of different kinds,\nsuch as macaque monkeys or bonobos.\nPeople have looked at\nthese sorts of things,\nbelieve it or not, in\nducks, in laboratory mice,\nin different types of birds, et cetera.\nAnd if you look at that literature,\nyou can essentially find\nbiological examples in the\nanimal kingdom for just about\nany behavior that you can\neasily map to human behavior.\nSo for instance, there's\na species of animal called\nthe prairie vole.\nIn one portion of the United States,\nthis prairie vole species is monogamous.\nThey only mate with\none other prairie vole,\nonly raise the young with\none other prairie vole\nfor their entire life.\nAnd in another region\nof the United States,\nthe same species of animal, prairie vole,\nwill mate with many individuals,\nthey're non-monogamous.\nAnd the major difference,\nat least as far as we know\nbetween the prairie voles in one location\nand another location is\nthe levels of a molecule\ncalled vasopressin in the brain and body.\nVasopressin is present in humans.\nIt has numerous biological roles.\nIt's responsible, for\ninstance, for controlling\nthe amount of urine that you excrete,\nthe amount of water that you retain,\nand for sexual desire,\nas well as mate seeking.\nLevels of vasopressin in prairie voles\nare strongly determinant of\nwhether or not a prairie vole\nis going to be a monogamous\nor non-monogamous.\nWhy do I raise this?\nWell, I raise this because the\nliterature on prairie voles\nis quite beautiful and has\nbeen discussed quite a lot\nin the popular press.\nYou can look it up with an\neasily, just Web Edge search.\nYou'll find lots of\ninformation about this,\nlots of news articles about this,\nand lots of interpretations\nas to how vasopressin might\nbe involved in similar or\ndifferent mechanisms in humans.\nNow, I don't have a problem\nwith mapping animal studies to humans.\nI think there's certainly\na place for that.\nBut if we just lean back\nand look at the giant mass\nof studies in animals and\ntheir mating behavior,\nand their mate selection behavior,\nyou can essentially find\nexamples of anything.\nYou can find examples of polygamy,\nyou can find examples of\ncheating, of infidelity,\nyou can find examples of all\nsorts of different behaviors\nthat in your own mind, you\ncan map to human behavior.\nBut it's really hard to make\nthe leap from animal models\nto humans in any kind of direct way.\nAnd so thankfully there's\nbeen tremendous work done\nin the last mainly 20 years or so,\nlooking at human mate selection,\nhuman desire, human love\nand human attachment.\nSo we're mainly going to\nfocus on those studies today,\nand where appropriate, we\nwill map those findings back\nto the findings in animals to\nsee if there's some universal\ntruths or some universal principles\nabout how the neural circuits\nand biological mechanisms work.\nBut by and large, we're going\nto focus on human studies today.\nSo unless I say otherwise,\nthe data that I'm referring\nto today are entirely from human beings.\nSo let's talk about attachment\nand attachment styles.\nAnd this will offer you the opportunity\nto answer some important\nquestions for yourself,\nsuch as what is my, meaning,\nyour attachment style in relationship?\nOne of the most robust findings\nin the field of psychology\nis this notion of attachment styles.\nAnd this was something that was discovered\nthrough a beautiful set\nof studies that were done\nby Mary Ainsworth in the 1980s,\nin which she developed\na laboratory condition\ncalled the strange situation task.\nNow, the strange situation\ntask has been studied\nover and over again in different cultures,\nin different locations\nthroughout the world.\nAnd in preparing for this episode,\nI actually spoke to three\ndifferent psychologists.\nI spoke to a psychoanalyst,\nI spoke to a cognitive\nbehavioral psychologist,\nand I actually spoke to a\npsychiatrist, excuse me,\nnot a psychologist, but a\npsychiatrist with a medical degree\nand asked, is the strange situation task\nand the various attachment\nstyles that emerge\nfrom that task, are those\nstill considered valid?\nAnd indeed all three of\nthem said if ever there was\na literature in psychology\nthat is absolutely tamped down\nand has a firm basis in both\ndata and real world principles\nand real world examples,\nit's this notion of attachment styles.\nSo what is the strange situation task?\nThe strange situation\ntask involves a parent,\ntypically a mother in the\nstudies that were done,\nbut a parent or other\ncaregiver bringing their child,\ntheir actual child into a laboratory.\nAnd there's a room with a\nstranger and the mother enters\nthe room with the child and\nthere are some toys in the room.\nAnd typically the mother\nand the stranger will talk.\nObviously the stranger is\npart of the experiment,\nis not just some random\nperson off the street.\nAnd the child is allowed\nto move about the room.\nThey can observe the mother interacting\nwith the other person or not,\nthey can play with toys or not,\nbut then at some point the mother leaves.\nAnd then at some point later\ndesignated by the experimenter,\nthe mother comes back.\nAnd what is measured in these\nstudies is both how the child,\nthe toddler reacts to the mother leaving,\nand how the child reacts\nto the mother returning\nat the end of the experiment.\nAnd oftentimes this will have\ntwo or three different phases\nwhere the mother will bring\nthe child in then leave,\nthen come back in and leave.\nThere are also studies in\nwhich the behavior of the child\nwith the stranger is also examined.\nSo there are a lot of variations of this,\nbut the basic findings are\nthat toddlers, children\nfall into four different\ncategories of attachment style.\nAnd that these attachment\nstyles can predict many features\nof adolescent, teen, young\nadult, and even adult\nattachment styles, not\nin strange situations\nof the sort that I just ascribed,\nbut in romantic attachments.\nI should mention also that\nattachment style is plastic,\nmeaning it can change across the lifespan.\nSo as I describe the results,\nI describe the different\nattachment styles that are out there,\nand if any of those resonate\nwith you or bring to mind\ncertain people in your life,\nplease do not assume that\nthose attachment styles\nare rigid and fixed\nfor the entire lifespan.\nThere are also terrific\ndata that indicate that\nthrough specific processes,\nboth psychological\nand some biological adjustments\nthat people can change\ntheir attachment style,\nand that indeed people who have\ndifferent attachment styles\ncan change the attachment\nstyles of others.\nBut just to make very\nclear what the results\nof the study were, I want to\nreview what the four different\nattachment styles are,\nand typically people fall\ninto one group or another but not several.\nSo the four patterns of\nattachment that were revealed\nby these studies, again,\nwere revealed by examining\nthe behavior of the child in\nresponse to the mother leaving\nand the mother returning,\nand the child's response\nto the stranger that is\nin the room with them.\nThe first style is the so-called\nsecure attachment style.\nIn the nomenclature of this kind of study,\nthese are the so-called B babies,\nas in the letter B, bulldog, B.\nNot for bulldogs, but just\nto designate this category.\nThe secure attachment style\nis one in which the child\nwill engage with the stranger,\nwith the experimenter\nwhile the parent is present in the room.\nBut that when the parent,\ntypically it's a mother,\nbut when the parent or\nother caregiver leaves,\nthe child does get visibly upset.\nThey might whine, they might cry,\nthey might even tantrum a bit.\nHowever, when the caregiver,\nmeaning the mother, or father,\nor other caregiver returns,\nthe child visibly expresses\nhappiness that the caregiver\nhas returned, okay?\nSo that's the hallmark of\nthe secure attachment style.\nAnd again, this is all pre-verbal.\nThis is happening long\nbefore the child can express\nhow they feel with words.\nAnd the interpretation of\nthis is that the secure child\nfeels confident that the\ncaregiver is available\nand will be responsive to their needs\nand their communications.\nSo that when the child\nwhines and, or is distressed,\nthe parent doesn't come\nright back into the room.\nBut at some point they do\nand they seem to have a sense\nof trust that if the\nparent or caregiver leaves\nthat the parent will come back,\nand that they're happy that they do.\nThese children are also\nvery good at exploring\nnovel environments after\nthe parent is gone,\nand while the parent is there.\nAnd almost always, when\nthe parent is there,\nthey will explore more broadly,\nliterally in space,\nthey'll venture out further\nthan they will when the parent is gone.\nThey also tend to engage\nwith the caregiver in a way\nthat's not immediately\nand completely trusting,\nbut that over time\nseems to evolve from one\nin which they're kind of\nsuspicious of this person\nto one in which they're at\nleast somewhat trusting, okay?\nSo these were the general contours\nof the secure attachment style.\nAnd fortunately, nowadays\nthere are physiological studies\nmeasuring things like\nheart rate and breathing\nand other measures that\ncorrelate with the subjective\nassessment of what these\nchildren are feeling.\nOkay, so first category\nis secure attached.\nThe second category is a\nso-called anxious-avoidant\nor insecurely attached, which\nare the category A babies.\nThe children with\nanxious-avoidant insecure\nattachment patterns\ngenerally tend to avoid\nor ignore the caregiver, all right?\nMeaning the parent, and\nshow very little emotion\nwhen the parent leaves or returns.\nSo this is the reason\nthey call them avoidant\nor anxious-avoidant and kind of insecure.\nThere isn't this happiness or\njoy that the parent is back.\nThey don't seem to express that.\nThey do not exhibit\ndistress on separation.\nAnd they generally tend to\nhave some tendency to approach\nthe caregiver when they return,\nbut there doesn't seem to be\na general expression of joy.\nAnd again, physiological\nmeasures support that as well.\nThings like changes in heart\nrate tend to be less dramatic\nin the anxious-avoidant\ninsecure attachment style\nthan in the secure attachment style.\nOkay, so that's the second one.\nThe third category is the so-called\nanxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure\ncategory.\nOkay, I didn't name these categories.\nSo you have to blame others\nin this one instance.\nFor everything else blame\nme, but in this instance,\nyou have to blame the psychologists\nthat named this category.\nThe anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure\ncategory\nalso called the C babies,\nfor the letter C just as a categorization.\nThe anxious-ambivalent,\nresistant-insecure toddlers, really,\nshow distress even before\nseparation from their mother\nor other caregiver.\nAnd they tend to be very\nclingy and difficult to comfort\nwhen the caregiver returns, okay?\nSo they're distressed even\nbefore the mother leaves the room\nand they tend to be very clingy\nand really hard to calm down\nwhen the mother returns.\nThey tend to show either\nwhat seems to be resentment\nin response to the parent's absence.\nWe don't really know what they're feeling.\nOr some helpless passivity.\nAnd there's actually subcategorizations\nthat the psychologists have\ncome up with, C one subtypes\nand C two subtypes.\nWe don't have to get bogged down in that.\nBut just know that there\nisn't one absolute measure\nthat says, oh, well, this person\nis anxious-ambivalent, resistant-insecure.\nThey could be somewhat\npassive, or they could be,\nseem somewhat angry at the caregiver.\nBut the basic idea is that\nbefore and after the separation,\nthey are clingy and difficult to comfort.\nThey just can't seem to\ncalm themselves down,\nand physiological measures\nof heart rate and hormone\nmeasurements such as cortisol\nalso support that statement.\nAnd the third category of\nattachment style is the so-called\ndisorganized or disoriented\nor D for the letter D babies.\nThis is a categorization\nthat was added later\nto this strange situation task.\nThat is a real hallmark of\ndevelopmental psychology studies.\nIt was developed by Mary\nAinsworth, graduate student,\nMary Maine, who I actually had\nthe great fortune of taking\na course from and learning\nfrom when I was a graduate\nstudent at Berkeley many years ago.\nAnd this fourth categorization\nwas controversial\nfor a while, but now\nis generally accepted.\nThe key feature of the\ndisorganized, disoriented category\nis that the toddlers tend to be tense\nand they tend to encompass a\nlot of odd physical postures.\nThey tend to hunch their shoulders.\nThey'll put their hands behind their neck.\nThey'll cock their head to the side.\nFor those of you listening,\nI'm doing this on the video version.\nIt's not where you don't\nhave to go see that.\nBut for those of you that\nare watching this on video,\nthey tend to constrain\ntheir body size a bit\nand going to odd postures\nthat they normally wouldn't\ndo anywhere else.\nSo this is why it's\ncalled the disorganized\nor disoriented category.\nIt seems like these children\njust don't really know\nhow to react to a separation.\nAnd they just start to manifest\nbehaviors and emotional\ntones that aren't observed\nin other situations.\nOkay, so we've got our four categories.\nI'll try and use the\nshortest possible names\nfor each category.\nWe've got category one,\nwhich is securely attached.\nWe've got category two,\nwhich is insecurely attached,\nalso sometimes called anxious-avoidant.\nThen we've got category three,\nwhich is the resistant-insecure category,\nwhich is anxious-ambivalent.\nAnd then there's this fourth category,\nthe disorganized, disoriented category\nwhere they're so-called D babies.\nNow, what's interesting about\nthis from the perspective\nof desire, love and attachment\nis that the categorizations\nof children into one of these\nfour different categories\nas toddlers is strongly predictive\nof their attachment style\nin romantic partnerships later in life.\nWhich is to me both amazing and surprising\nand not surprising all at the same time.\nAmazing because it means\nthat, first of all,\nwe are relatively\nhardwired for attachment.\nI think that that's\nincredible and beautiful,\nthat we have designated\nneurons, nerve cells\nand hormonal systems\nthat are there to ensure\nthat we have some response\nto a caregiver being there,\nor not being there, or\nreturning, or leaving,\nbut also that the same neural\ncircuitries, the same hormonal\nresponses are at least\nin some way repurposed\nfor entirely different types\nof attachments later in life.\nSo when we hear the psychologist\ntalk about how we formed\na template early in life\nbased on experiences\nthat were even pre-verbal\nbefore we had language,\nand those templates are\nsuperimposed on our relationships,\nor we should say, our later\nrelationships are superimposed\non those templates, there\nreally is a basis for that.\nWe now have neuroimaging studies\nto support, for instance,\nthe work of Allan Schore\nfrom UCLA, showing that\nwhen a mother and child\ninteract, either through very\nsoothing interactions,\nlike bottle feeding,\nor breastfeeding, or\nsinging to one's baby,\nor putting them to sleep,\nthat the brain of the child\nand the brain of the mother\nare entering a coordinated\nstate of relaxation.\nAnd it's not one\ndirection, mother to child,\nthe child is also calming the mother.\nTypically these studies were\ndone with mothers again,\nsometimes with fathers,\nbut typically with mothers.\nAnd in addition to that, when\nthe mother or other caregiver\nacts very excited and raises their voice,\nor puts a lilt in their\nvoice, or widens their eyes,\nthat the child will do the same.\nAnd again, there's a\nbidirectional interaction\nin that case of excitement.\nAnd there's the release of\nneurochemicals like dopamine\ninto the bloodstream, whereas\nin the relaxation scenario\nand the soothing scenario,\nthere's we know the release\nof things like serotonin and oxytocin.\nSo the neural systems for\nattachment and the neural systems\nfor what we call autonomic\narousal for being alert and calm\ndon't act in a vacuum.\nThey are tethered to other\npeople in our environment.\nAnd of course we know this, right?\nWe sometimes hear the statement,\nno one can make you feel anything.\nI've always had a little bit of a problem\nwith that statement.\nI don't think I'm contradicting\nanyone in particular,\nbut you hear that a lot, no\none can make you feel anything.\nIndeed they can, right?\nA physical injury can\nmake you feel something.\nIf somebody says something\nthat you very much like,\nit can make you feel something.\nAnd if somebody says something\nthat you very much dislike,\nit will make you feel something.\nSo the idea that no one\ncan make us feel anything\nisn't actually true.\nOur nervous system is tethered\nto the nervous systems of others.\nAnd that is true from the very\nearliest stages of our lives.\nAnd in this case, we're\ntalking about how our templates\nfor attachment in romantic\nrelationships, how we find them,\nhow we maintain them, and\nindeed how we break them\nand reform them is based on a\ntemplate that was established\nthrough an entirely\ndifferent set of priorities,\nwhich was how we feel safe and\nsecure in novel environments,\ndepending on whether or\nnot our primary caregiver\nis there or not.\nNeuroimaging supports that.\nWhen I say neuroimaging, I\nmean, brain scan support that,\nmeasures of hormones in the\nbody and brain support that,\nmeasures of neurochemicals support that.\nThere's simply no way around this truth,\nthat we have a set of roadmaps\nin our mind that are reused\nfor entirely different\npurposes later in life.\nThat is vitally important to understand.\nBecause if one is successful in forming\nromantic attachments, maintaining\nthem, et cetera, or not,\ndoes in fact reflect the earlier templates\nthat you've created.\nBut as I've mentioned\nbefore, the good news is\nthat these templates can shift over time.\nAnd one of the more powerful\nways to shift those templates\nover time is purely by the\nknowledge that they exist,\nand the understanding that\nthose templates are malleable.\nThey can change through the\nprocess of neuroplasticity.\nAgain, neuroplasticity is just a rewiring\nof nerve connection.\nThat is very much present in childhood,\nbut also very much present in adulthood.\nSo if you're somebody who\nyou think falls into category\none, two, three, or four,\nor you know somebody,\nor involved with somebody\nwho falls into category\none, two, three, and four,\nthe mere knowledge of\nthat can be very useful.\nBut you might ask, well, what\ndo I do with that knowledge?\nWell, fortunately, both\npsychologists and biologists\nhave started to leverage that\nknowledge toward establishing\nbetter, more secure bonds in\nadult romantic relationships.\nAnd there's a book that has\nreally tapped into this.\nI think it's the first book\nthat has really addressed\nthis head on.\nAnd that book comes from\ntwo Columbia professors.\nAnd title of the book is\n\"Attached: The New Science of Adult\nAttachment and How It Can\nHelp You Find and Keep Love.\"\nThe authors of this book are\nAmir Levine and Rachel Heller.\nAgain, both of them are skilled\nacademics and researchers\nwho have really taken the\nliterature that I described\non the strange situation task\nand mapped it to adult attachment styles.\nAnd also they've mapped out\nways that they've observed\nin their clinical practice.\nAnd that is laboratory\nsupported for, for instance,\npeople that have an anxious-ambivalent\nor what we were calling\ninsecure attachment style,\nor for people that fall\ninto the disorganized or\ndisoriented attachment style,\nhow they can modify that\nattachment style in or out\nof relationships in order\nto establish what I think\neverybody wants, which\nis secure attachment.\nWhy does everybody want that?\nWell, secure attachment\nallows people to be both\nin relationship, or if they\nchoose to be on their own,\nor to be in relationship\nbut physically separated\nfrom somebody else, or\neven emotionally separated\nfrom somebody else and maintain\nwhat we call a stable\nautonomic equilibrium,\nthe ability to remain calm, clearheaded.\nYou might not like what's happening,\nbut you're able to navigate\nthat with some sense of clarity\nand not excessive discomfort.\nSo, is there a goal in all of this stuff\nabout love, desire, and attachment?\nIndeed, there is.\nThe secure attachment\nstyle is the one that leads\nto the most stable and predictable\nlong-term relationships.\nPut differently, babies,\ntoddlers, adolescents, teens,\nand young adults that have\na secure attachment style\nare more likely to find and\nform long-term relationships\nthan are people in the other categories.\nBut people in other categories\ncan learn and eventually\nmigrate into the secure attachment style.\nAnd I think that book \"Attached...\"\nI have no affiliation to the\nauthors or the book itself,\nI should just mention that.\n\"Attached: The New Science\nof Adult Attachment\nand How It Can Help You\nFind and Keep Love,\"\nreally it sounds very pop psychology, yes,\nbut it is really grounded\nin the research psychology literature.\nAnd there's also some\ninteresting biology there.\nAnother point to make\nabout attachment styles\nis that it is possible.\nAnd some of you may be\nfamiliar with circumstances\nwhereby people who are securely attached,\neither because they grew\nup in an environment\nwhere secure attachment was cultivated,\nor because they developed\nthat on their own,\ncan also migrate out of the\nsecurely attached category\ninto insecurely attached,\nor into avoidant types\nof attachment styles as\nteens, or as young adults,\nor as adults at any age\nor any stage of life,\nby virtue of being with\nsomebody who has a different,\nperhaps less adaptive\nattachment style, right?\nWhat this means is that\nif you have or you develop\na secure attachment style,\nit's vitally important\nto protect that attachment\nstyle because it is possible\nto become anxiously attached,\neven if you grew up in a\nstable attachment framework.\nAnd again, this can happen at any stage.\nSo if you're interested\nin attachment styles\nand how they influence\nadult romantic attachments,\nand certainly if you are a\nparent, I would encourage you\nto check out the book, \"Attached.\"\nAgain, it's quite good and I\nthink that it offers a number\nof actionable tools to both form\nand hold onto secure attachment styles.\nSo I mentioned that the neural\ncircuits for child-parent\nor child-caregiver\nattachment are repurposed\nfor romantic attachment later in life.\nBut what are these neural circuits?\nWhat do they do?\nI mean, it's so attractive, if you will,\nto think about a brain\narea that controls love,\nor a brain area that controls desire,\nor a brain area that controls attachment,\nbut it simply doesn't work that way.\nAs I've talked about\nbefore on this podcast\nand I will say again and\nagain because it will persist\nto be true long after I'm gone,\nis that no one brain area\ncan give rise to anything\nas complex as desire,\nor love, or attachment.\nInstead, there are\nmultiple brain areas that\nthrough their coordinated action create\na song that we call desire,\nor a song that we call love,\nor a song that we call attachment.\nNot a literal song,\nalthough there are songs\nabout desire, love, and\nattachment, of course, many songs,\nsome good, some not so good.\nBut rather different brain\nareas being active in different\nsequences and with different\nintensities can make us feel\nas if we are in the mode\nthat we call desire,\nor in the mode of love, or\nin the mode of attachment.\nBut beneath all of that is this element\nof autonomic arousal.\nAnd I want to focus on autonomic arousal\njust for a bit longer,\nbecause it really is one\nof the three core elements\nby which we form and\nmaintain loving attachments,\nand by which we break loving attachments.\nThe autonomic nervous system\nas the name suggests is automatic.\nIn fact, that's what autonomic means.\nNow it's actually the\ncase that we can control\nour autonomic nervous system\nto some degree or another.\nBut the autonomic nervous\nsystem controls things like\ndigestion, our breathing,\nwhether or not we're conscious\nof that breathing or not.\nIt controls things like how\nalert we are or sleepy we are.\nAnd the autonomic nervous system,\nas I just briefly described earlier,\nis really something that we\ncome into the world with.\nIt's hardwired, all\nthe elements are there.\nBut through interactions with our parent,\neither soothing interactions,\nor fun, playful interactions,\nor dare I say, scary interactions,\nour autonomic nervous\nsystem gets tuned up.\nMeaning, we each develop a\ntendency to either be more alert\nand anxious, or more calm, or\na balance of alert and calm.\nNow, of course, this\nchanges across each day\nand depending how tired\nwe are late in the day.\nIf we've been awake for a while,\nwe tend to get sleepy early in the day.\nIf we're very rested,\nwe tend to wake up and feel very alert.\nSo the way to think about\nthe autonomic nervous system\nis it's kind of a seesaw.\nWe go back and forth\nbetween being very alert,\nwe can be alert and calm, or\nwe can be very, very alert,\nwe can be in a state of panic,\nwe can be fast asleep so\nwe can be extremely calm,\nor we can just be sleepy, semi\ncalm but still also alert.\nSo think about it like a seesaw.\nAnd that seesaw has a hinge,\nand that hinge defines how\ntight or loose that seesaw is,\nhow readily it can tilt back and forth.\nOur autonomic tone is\nhow tight that hinge is.\nAnd there are biological\nmechanisms to explain this,\nbut here I just want to\nstay with the analogy\nof the seesaw for now.\nThe interactions between child\nand caregiver early in life\ntake the child and the caregiver\nfrom one end of the seesaw to the other.\nFrom being very alert in a\nstate of play, for instance,\nto being nursed and being very\nsoothed until we go to sleep.\nAnd of course, we each have a seesaw,\nthe parent and the child has a seesaw,\nand they're interacting.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, there are beautiful\nstudies, and beautiful\nnot in the sense that they\nfocused on a pleasant topic,\nbut beautiful because they\nwere done so beautifully well,\nthat looked at, for instance,\nthe response of mothers\nand their physiologies and\nthe response of children\nand their physiologies\nduring the bombing of cities\nduring World War II.\nSo an unpleasant situation.\nBut what was revealed during\nthe course of these studies\nwas that if the mothers were very stressed\nduring an onslaught of\nbombing of the city,\nthe children's physiologies\ntended to be stressed also,\nand persisted in being stressed\nlong after that stressful\nepisode was done.\nThey actually followed that these children\nwell out from many decades afterwards.\nConversely, if the parent,\nand in this case, again,\nit was mothers that were\nexplored in these studies,\nhad turned this whole business of going\ninto the bomb shelters into\nsomewhat of a game, right?\nTaking it seriously, but\nessentially telling the children,\n\"Okay, it's time to go,\"\nbut not expressing much\nstress or distress,\nthe children also didn't\ndevelop much stress,\nor distress, or trauma.\nNow there were exceptions\nto this, of course,\nbut in general, that was the rule\nthat the autonomic nervous\nsystems of children tend to mimic\nthe autonomic nervous systems\nof the primary caregiver.\nAnd the mechanisms by which\nthis occurs has been explored.\nAnd again I just refer to the\nbeautiful work of Allan Schore\nat University of California, Los Angeles.\nAnd again, his name is\nSchore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.\nI'm looking down briefly at the floor here\nbecause I'll just reach for the book.\nHe has a wonderful book called\n\"Right Brain Psychotherapy.\"\nIt's a little bit technical,\nbut if you're interested\nin some of the studies,\nthis book \"Right Brain\nPsychotherapy\" details how everything\nfrom nursing of children\nto playtime behavior,\nto strange situation type\ntask behavior that we talked\nabout before which of\ncourse occurs when children\nget dropped off at\ndaycare, or nursery school,\nor with babysitters, et cetera.\nAnd indeed all types of\ncaregiver-child interactions\ntune up that autonomic nervous system,\nso that the child ends up with\nan autonomic nervous system\nthat either tends to lean more\ntowards alert and anxious,\nor can be very alert but calm,\nor can be very calm and hard to budge.\nAgain, it's the tightness of that hinge\nthat really underlies\nthese attachment styles\nthat we were talking about earlier,\nand not on this episode of\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\nbut on many other previous\nprevious episodes,\nsuch as the master stress episode,\nor some of the optimized health episodes.\nYou can find these if you\nwant at hubermanlab.com.\nA lot of the tools and techniques\nthat are recommended there\nhave to do with readjusting\nthe autonomic nervous system\nin deliberate ways as an adult.\nAgain, I won't go into the specific tools,\nbut for instance, the physiological sigh.\nThis tool that I've talked\nabout extensively of two inhales\nthrough the nose, as deeply\nas you can on the first one,\nsneaking in a little bit\nmore air on the second one,\nand then a long exhale through the mouth\nis a way of adjusting\nthat autonomic seesaw.\nIt tends to make us more calm.\nIt activates what we call\nthe parasympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous\nsystem, which is just fancy nerd\nspeak for it's a quick way\nto calm yourself down, right?\nThings like ice baths, or cold\nshowers, or cold immersion,\nor deliberate\nhyperventilation by contrast,\nor ways in which we can\ndeliberately increase the level\nof our so-called sympathetic\narm of our autonomic nervous\nsystem to make ourselves more alert.\nWhy would you want to do that?\nWell, you can do that to be more alert,\nto be more awake, if you like,\nor as a form of self-induced\nstress inoculation\nto be able to tolerate\nhigher levels of adrenaline\nby making it a practice\nthat you self-direct.\nThe reason those tools are out\nthere is because many of us,\nfor whatever reason, we\ndon't have to blame anyone,\nbut because of our childhood templates,\nbecause of things that\nhappened and didn't happen\nin terms of our interactions\nwith caregivers,\nhave autonomic nervous systems\nthat are tilted to one side\nor the other more than we would like.\nOr in which the hinge that I'm\ntalking about in this analogy\nis too loose or that is too tight.\nAnd we're stuck in a mode of anxiousness,\nor stuck in a mode of lack of energy.\nThat's what those tools are really about.\nBut at a deeper level, the\nautonomic nervous system\nis really the system that\ngoverns how we will react\nin response to a romantic\npartner being present or leaving.\nAnd I don't necessarily mean\nleaving the relationship\nentirely, although it\ncould mean that, right?\nWe know people, I'm sure you\nknow people that upon the end\nof a relationship that\nthey wanted very much,\nare absolutely crushed.\nAnd actually in researching\nthis episode there,\nI discovered there's an\nextensive literature finding\nthat the feelings that one has\nafter a breakup are very much\nlike a clinical depression in many cases.\nBut there are individuals\nthat can look at a breakup\nas a transient event\nthat they don't interpret\nas going to mean so much for\nall aspects of their life\nor reshaping their view\nof themselves, why?\nWell, we have different\nlevels of autonomic function.\nAnd depending on where our\nseesaw is, if you will,\nsome of us become extremely\ndistraught and can't recalibrate\nourselves, can't adjust ourselves\ndown from stress to calm,\nor can't take ourselves\nfrom exhausted to more alert\nif we need to do that on our own.\nAnd so that's why tools\nfor doing that exist.\nBut attachment itself is about\nwhere our autonomic\nnervous system resides.\nSo if I were to offer a set\nof tools around these topics\nof desire, love and attachment,\nI would say, first of all,\nyou might want to think\nabout whether or not you fall\ninto the secure, insecure,\nor other attachment styles.\nSecond, I think it is vitally\nimportant for all of us,\nbut certainly for people\nthat are in relationships\nor seeking relationships to\nbe able to at least have some\nrecognition of where our\nautonomic nervous system tends\nto reside both in terms of\nwhen we are with somebody\nand when they leave.\nWhen we are apart for\nlong periods of time,\ncan we calm ourselves? Can we self-soothe?\nOr are we very much dependent\non the presence of another\nin order to feel soothed?\nNow, I absolutely want to emphasize\nthat there is nothing wrong.\nIn fact, there's everything\nright with feeling great\nin the presence of somebody else.\nThat is actually a hallmark\nof strong and quality attachments.\nThese days, we hear the\nterm codependent a lot.\nThis was a, I believe,\nthe term was first coined\nby Pia Mellody.\nAnd it actually does occupy\nan important role in the world\nof trauma, trauma healing,\nso-called trauma bonding,\ntopics of another episode.\nActually, did an episode\non fear and trauma.\nAnd we will do one all\nabout trauma bonding\nwith an expert at some\npoint in the future.\nBut codependence and codependency,\nthe term can sometimes\nbe misinterpreted as any\ndependence on another isn't good.\nInterdependence, a\nhealthy interdependence,\nof course is good.\nIt is the hallmark of healthy\nchild-parent relations,\nsibling relations and romantic relations.\nBut a key element of healthy\ninterdependence is that,\nyes, our autonomic\nnervous system is adjusted\nby the presence of another, but\nthat also that we can adjust\nour own autonomic nervous system,\neven in the absence of that person.\nThat if the person goes away\ntemporarily or permanently,\nthat we can still regulate our\nown autonomic nervous system,\nboth from states of\nstress to states of calm,\nboth from states of exhaustion\nto states of more alertness.\nAnd of course, we all need sleep\nto go from exhaustion to alertness.\nBut what I'm referring to here\nis the ability to regulate\nwhen distraught, or\nregulate when fatigued,\nor feeling depressed.\nAnd that is and is all about\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nSo as we talk about attachment styles,\nand we talk about infant and toddler\nand adult attachment styles,\nwhat we are really talking\nabout is a complex set\nof neural circuitries.\nAnd one of those neural\ncircuitries, which is absolutely\ncrucial is this autonomic nervous system.\nSo if the autonomic nervous\nsystem is one key component\nof desire, love and attachment,\nwhat are the other two?\nAnd what I'm going to tell you\nnext is largely the pioneering\nwork of Helen Fisher, who\nis really an anthropologist,\nwho's become a bit of a\nneuroscientist and has collaborated\nwith neuroscientists to\nestablish brain areas\nand neural circuits that are associated\nwith different aspects of\nattachment, love and desire.\nI think the first really\nhigh quality study\nof neural circuits\nassociated with these themes\nwas a paper published in 2005\nin a very fine anatomical\njournal, perhaps the best\nneural anatomical journal,\nwhich is the Journal of\nComparative Neurology.\nThe Journal of Comparative\nNeurology has been around\nfor more than 100 years and\nis considered the archival\nlocation for placing really\nhigh quality anatomy.\nThey have tremendously high standards.\nAnd the study that I'm\nreferring to is entitled,\n\"Romantic Love: An fMRI,\"\nmeaning functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging,\n\"Study of a Neural\nMechanism for Mate Choice.\"\nAnd Dr. Fisher is a author on this paper\nas is Arthur Aron, and Lucy Brown.\nSo all very fine researchers.\nAnd this study as well\nas several other studies\nusing magnetic resonance imaging,\nthings like EEG, neuro\nanatomical tracing, et cetera,\nhave identified a large\nnumber of brain areas\nthat are associated with different aspects\nof desire, love, and attachment.\nAnd I'll just throw out a few\nnames of those brain areas\nand what they control.\nAnd then I'll tell you how those anchor\nto the other two categories\nof neural circuits\nessential for desire,\nlove, and attachment.\nSo not surprisingly the\ndopamine system in the brain\nis associated with desire,\nlove, and attachment,\nand mainly with desire,\nalthough to some extent, love.\nDopamine is a neurochemical sometimes\nassociated with reward.\nBut as some of you have\nheard me say before,\nit is mainly a molecule of\nmotivation, craving and pursuit.\nAnd that motivation, craving\nand pursuit that relates\nto dopamine is not unique to\nattachment, or love, or sex,\nor mating, et cetera.\nIt is a universal generic\ncurrency in the brain\nfor pursuing something.\nFood when you're hungry,\na mate when you want one,\nto mate when you want to,\nwarmth when you're cold,\net cetera, et cetera, okay?\nSo it's not for one specific purpose.\nBut the brain areas associated\nwith dopamine involve,\nfor instance, the ventral tegmental area,\nthe substantia nigra, areas of\nthat sort, the basal ganglia.\nYou don't need to know these names,\njust understand that these\nare networks of neurons\nthat tend to have put the\nperson, you into a state\nof forward action and pursuit\nand craving and motivation.\nThey are not about being\nquiescent, relaxed, et cetera.\nThe neural circuits for\nquiescence and relaxation\nare most associated with\nlove and attachment,\nnot surprisingly, and\nthey're the neurochemical\nserotonin, and to some extent, oxytocin\nare the predominant\nneurochemicals involved.\nAnd those are released from brain areas,\nsuch as the raphe nucleus\nin the back of the brain.\nYou may have heard that\nthe majority of serotonin\nin your body is made in your\ngut, and indeed, that's true,\nbut I hate to break it to\nyou, the serotonin in your gut\nis not responsible for your\nfeelings of love and attachment,\nat least not to a high degree.\nThat's mainly going to be\nthe reflection of neurons\nin your brain that make serotonin.\nAnd there are other areas of\nthe brain that make serotonin\nas well and oxytocin as well,\nbut they tend to be associated\nwith the warmth and calm,\nand the soothing that we feel\nin the presence of another.\nAnd again, these are not\nstrictly divided circuits.\nWe can have dopamine and\nserotonin present in our brain\nand body at the same time to\nequal or different degrees.\nAnd we return in a little bit\nto what happens when levels\nof dopamine are very high and\nlevels of serotonin are low\nand vice versa and so on,\nincluding in states of\nneurochemically modified states,\nas it were in, when we talk\nabout things like MDMA,\nso-called ecstasy.\nBut in the meantime,\nI want to just discuss\nthe two neural circuits that use dopamine,\nthat use serotonin and oxytocin,\nand that collaborate with\nthe autonomic nervous system\nto drive what we call\ndesire, love and attachment.\nAnd the three circuits are\nautonomic nervous system,\nwe talked about that one.\nThen there's the nervous system components\nor the neural circuits for\nempathy, for being able to see\nand respond to indeed\nmatch the emotional tone\nor the autonomic tone of another.\nAnd then there's the third category,\nand this might surprise some of you,\nit certainly surprised me,\nbut the data point to the fact\nthat the third neural circuit\nthat's very important\nfor establishing bonds\nis one associated with positive delusions.\nSo given that the neural\ncircuits for empathy\nare absolutely crucial for falling in love\nand maintaining stable attachments,\nI'd like to talk about\nthose neural circuits\nand what they are.\nNow, often when we hear empathy, we think,\noh, empathy is really about\nlistening to and really\nunderstanding what\nsomebody else is feeling.\nMaybe even feeling what they're feeling.\nAnd indeed that's the case,\nbut what do we mean by that?\nRight? What is it to\nfeel what another feels?\nWell, what it means is that their seesaw\nis driving your seesaw,\nor your seesaw is somehow\ndriving their seesaw.\nThat there's a match in terms\nof the tilt of those seesaws.\nNow it doesn't have to\nbe an exact match, right?\nIf someone that you really he care about\nis very, very stressed, you\ncould also become very stressed.\nThat's a form of empathic matching,\nand there are indeed\nneural circuits for that.\nI'll describe what those neural\ncircuits are in a moment.\nBut sometimes the best role\nfor us to take is actually one\nin which we are calm when\nthe person that we care about\nor that we are romantically involved\nwith is very, very anxious.\nAnd in a few minutes, I'll\ntalk about how matching\nof emotional tone can be good or bad\nfor the stability of a relationship,\nand complementarity of autonomic matching\ncan be good or bad.\nIn other words, sometimes it's\nbeneficial for a relationship\nto go into the same state as the other.\nAnd sometimes it's more\nbeneficial for us to not go\ninto the same state as the other.\nBut the important feature here\nis that when we talk about\nemotional matching or empathy\nor going into the same state\nor not going into the same\nstate, what we are really talking\nabout is whether or not\nthe autonomic seesaw\nof one individual is\ndriving the autonomic seesaw\nof the other individual.\nAnd this is a vital principle\nfor how we fall in love\nand form attachments.\nAnd it's actually part of the desire\nand mating process itself.\nI would go so far as to say\nthat one of the prerequisites\nto the propagation and\nexpansion of our species\nis this notion of autonomic regulation.\nAnd to some extent, matching\nof autonomic nervous systems.\nLet me explain what I mean.\nLast I checked, the only way\nthat new humans can be created\nis by way of sperm meeting\negg, either in body or in dish,\nbut sperm meets egg and then\ntypically nine months later,\nwe have a human baby.\nThe process of bringing\nsperm to egg, right?\nMating behavior, sex behavior in humans\nis one of autonomic regulation.\nAnd what I mean by that is\nthe process of finding a mate,\nand in this case, I mean,\nactually someone to mate with,\ntypically, well,\nscenarios vary, typically,\nis one of elevated autonomic arousal,\nmeaning increased activation\nof the so-called\nsympathetic nervous system.\nThis is related to dopamine release\nand it's related to epinephrine release.\nThere has to be a pursuit\nor at least there has to be\na mobilization to arrive\nin the same location\nwhereby one can mate, right?\nThat almost always is the case.\nHowever, the sexual arousal itself\nin both males and females\nis actually driven primarily\nby the parasympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nSo while pursuit is one of\nalertness and sympathetic drive,\nas we say, again, sympathy is not really\nwhat's at play here,\nthe word simple means together,\nand the activation of the\nautonomic nervous system\ntoward more alert state\nis because of a\nsympathetic nervous system,\nmeaning the co-activation\ntogether of many neurons\nin the brain and spinal cord.\nBut then the actual\nphysiological arousal state\nthat we call sexual\narousal is predominantly\nparasympathetically driven, okay?\nTo be quite direct about this,\nif the sympathetic nervous\nsystem activation is too high,\nthe sexual arousal response\ncannot happen in either males\nor in females, it's inhibited.\nHowever, the orgasm and\nejaculation response,\nwhich if you think about\nit is required for sperm\nto meet egg is sympathetic driven.\nAnd then after orgasm and ejaculation,\nthe parasympathetic nervousness\nsystem kicks back in,\nand there's a calming and relaxation.\nSo the arc of mating involves\nsympathetic arousal, okay?\nNot sympathy, but alertness\nand arousal for pursuit,\nthen a tilt of the seesaw\nat least to some degree\nfor arousal of the sort\nthat we typically hear\nof sexual arousal.\nThen at the point of orgasm\nand ejaculation is back\nto a sympathetic response.\nAnd how can I say that?\nHow do I know that?\nThe sympathetic nervous\nsystem meaning neurons\nwithin the sympathetic arm of\nthe autonomic nervous system\nare what drive ejaculation and orgasm.\nAnd then afterward there's a return\nto increased parasympathetic activation.\nAnd we don't know for\nsure why that happens,\nbut it's thought that in\nspecies that pair bond,\nhumans generally pair bond, not always,\nthere the return to more\nparasympathetic activation\nafter orgasm and ejaculation\nis thought to increase\nthe exchange of pheromonal\norders, odors, excuse me,\nand to increase pillow\ntalk and pair bonding\nof different kinds, okay?\nSo that's the seesaw going back\nand forth is actually built\ninto the process by which our\nentire species propagates.\nSo in some ways, every human\nis required to navigate\nthat process if they want\ntheir offspring to persist.\nAnd of course, nowadays\nthere are technologies like\nin vitro fertilization,\nintrauterine insemination,\nthere are a variety of ways\nthat technology has allowed\npeople to circumvent the\nactual physical mating process\nin the way that I described.\nBut by and large, that's\nthe way it it's done.\nAnd certainly that's the\nway it was done historically\nfor if not tens of thousands\nor hundreds of thousands of years.\nThat process is also what happens\nin all mammalian species that mate.\nOkay, so I'm overlooking\nan entire literature\nof animal studies that classic\nstudies of this were done\nby two individuals, I'll\njust briefly mention them\nin case you want to\nlook at the literature.\nThere's a guy at the\nRockefeller University named\nDonald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, who\nhas done beautiful studies\nidentifying the neural circuitry,\nwhat's called the lordosis response.\nUnlike in humans, the\nmating behavior of animals\nis rather stereotyped in\nterms of the positions\nthat they occupy.\nAnd the lordosis response is a U-shaping\nor a bending up of the hindquarters\nof typically of rodents,\nbut of other animals as well.\nThe the male mounting is\nalmost always from behind\nexcept in some species of primates.\nAnd that lordosis response\nis only going to occur\nduring particular phases\nof the estrous cycle.\nThe estrous cycle is the\nanalog to the menstrual cycle,\nbut it's not 28 days, it's four\ndays or some other duration\nin other animals, depending on the animal.\nThe lordosis response is\nstrongly regulated by odors,\nby contact and is estrogen\nand testosterone controlled.\nAnd then the male portion of\nthe mating sequence in animals,\nthe mounting and thrusting and\nejaculation as they're called\nor mounting, thrusting,\nintromission and ejaculation.\nThose are the four scientific categories\nthat have been described,\nthat's presence in\nrodents and also in dogs\nwhere it was primarily\nstudied by Frank Beach,\nwho was at University\nof California, Berkeley\nfor a long time.\nAnd the entire literature\naround the neural circuitry\nfor sexual mating behavior\nin animals largely stemmed\nfrom the work of Donald\nPfaff and Frank Beach\nand their scientific offspring,\nnot their actual offspring.\nYou can look at that\nliterature, if you like.\nThere have been human neuroimaging\nstudies of the process\nthat I described a few minutes\nago, believe it or not,\nof people in brain scanners,\nnot necessarily mating\nwith other people, but going\nthrough that arc of arousal,\nsympathetic activation\nduring orgasm or ejaculation\nand then the post-ejaculatory\nor orgasmic phase\nin both men and women.\nAnd the brain areas associated with those\nhave all been mapped out now.\nThe spinal cord areas that\ncontrol things like erection,\nvaginal lubrication,\nejaculation and orgasm,\nthose have also been mapped out.\nAnd this has all been\nexplored from the perspective\nof both basic science, just\nto get an understanding\nof how our species has sexual\ninteractions and reproduces,\nbut also from the\nperspective of, for instance,\ntrying to repair sexual function\nafter spinal cord injury,\nwhich is a prominent\nconcern for a lot of people,\ndepending on where they have their injury,\nbut in the number of people\nthat have spinal cord injuries.\nSo this is both vital\nbiological and clinical data.\nThe neural circuits for\neverything that I just described\nreside in the autonomic nervous\nsystem and are coordinated\nwith the neural circuits that\nare associated with empathy.\nThe neural circuits for\nempathy, again, there are many,\nbut mainly two structures\nthat you should know about,\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nwhich is how we perceive\nthings outside of us\nand make decisions on the\nbasis of those perceptions,\nhow we organize those decisions,\nand an area of the brain\ncalled the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.\nThe insula is a really interesting\nbrain area that allows us\nto interocept, to pay attention\nto what's going on inside\nour body and to split some of\nour attention, to exterocept.\nAnd the mating dance, whether\nor not it's the dinner\nand date portion of the mating dance,\nor the actual physical dance\npart of the main dance,\nor actual mating and sexual\nbehavior, kissing or otherwise,\nthat is a coordinated\nactivity of two bodies,\ntypically it's two.\nI realize sometimes it's\nmore, sometimes it's only one,\nbut typically it's two bodies\nat least in the framework\nwe're using here.\nThat coordinated dance is one\nin which the autonomic nervous\nsystem of one individual\nin general is coordinating with\nthe autonomic nervous system\nof the other individual.\nAnd the insula is essentially\nsplitting one's attention\nbetween how we feel\nourselves, how our body feels,\nwhat we're thinking with the thinking\nand the bodily sensations of the other.\nAnd that can be communicated,\nobviously, through words,\nit can be communicated through sounds,\nit can be communicated through touch,\nand it can be communicated\nthrough a number\nof more subtle cues like\npupil size or whether or not,\ncertainly in cases where\nwe recognize the person\nand we know their responses,\ntheir autonomic responses\nunder different conditions.\nWe can assess, is the person comfortable?\nAre they uncomfortable?\nAre they more focused\non me or on themselves?\nThis is the coordinated silent dance that\nif we look out in neurobiological terms,\nwe can really see is all about\nthe autonomic nervous system,\nwhether or not it's time to\ntip the seesaw to one side\nor the other, depending on\nwhether or not the other person's\nseesaw is tilted higher\nor lower than the other.\nOkay, so we have the\nautonomic nervous system,\nand then we have this thing\nthat we're calling empathy,\nwhich is really about autonomic matching.\nAnd again, the insula\nand the prefrontal cortex\nare neural circuits that are\ncrucial for autonomic matching,\nbecause they allow us to\nsay, what's out there,\nand do I want to match to it or not? Okay?\nAnd then the third\ncategory of neural circuit\nthat Helen Fisher and others\nhave found to be important\nfor desire, love and attachment\nis the neural circuit\nassociated with self-delusion.\nWhat do we mean by that?\nWell, first of all, self-delusion\nimplies a kind of cynicism\nabout love and attachment.\nAnd I think it was George\nBernard Shaw that said,\n\"Love is really about overestimating\nthe differences between individuals.\"\nActually, when I hear\nthat, and as I say it,\nI really don't like that quote.\nI have no bone to pick\nwith George Bernard Shaw,\nbut what it suggests and I\nthink what he meant was that,\nin love and attachment, we\ntend to put so much value\nin the other that we forget\nthat many of the processes\nthat are going on in our brain and body\nactually could be evoked\nby many other people too.\nBut I think it somewhat\noverlooks the enormous power\nof attachment and the ways\nin which somebody's smell,\nsomebody's voice, somebody's everything,\nor somebody's particular\nthing or things can really\nbecome so vital for our\nautonomic nervous system\nto feel soothed and to\nfeel elated, et cetera.\nSo I think that while\nthe quote is accurate,\nin the one sense, I think it does overlook\nthe neural circuits for attachment\nand just how deeply wired\nthose can become for us.\nSo I will balance that quote\nwith an enormous number\nof other quotes that I won't\nmention, but that you can find\nout there that really point to\nhow incredible the person is\nthat one tends to be attached\nto that there's really\nonly one or several people\nthat could ever exist\nthat could evoke those feelings from us.\nAnd of course you can\nread your Neruda poetry,\nand you can find these\nthings all over the place,\nin music, and poetry, and writing.\nSo for every cynical quote\nabout these neural circuits\nbeing generic and could\nbe activated by anybody,\nI think you'll find an ample\nnumber of opposing quotes\nthat these neural circuits\ncan only be activated\nby that special someone,\nor that particular person,\nor maybe in just a small\nset of those people.\nSo what of delusion?\nWell, the work of Helen Fisher\nand others has really pointed\nto the fact that desire,\nlove and attachment\nare three separate phases\nof what we call romantic relationships.\nThat typically, not always,\nbut typically desire tends\nto come first or falls in the early phase.\nThat the process of\nromantic/sexual interactions,\nit doesn't necessarily\nhave to be sex itself,\nbut certainly something\nthat involves intimacy\nof some kind, right?\nAnd generally touch of some kind,\neventually transitions\ninto what we call love,\nwhich eventually transitions\ninto what we call attachment.\nAnd I should just mention\ntouch because touch\nis a fundamental aspect\nof this whole process.\nThere's an article, a research\narticle, I should say,\nthe title of it is,\n\"Relationship-specific\nEncoding of Social Touch\nin Somatosensory and Insular Cortices.\"\nCortices being cortex.\nCortex's plural, cortices.\nAnd again, there's our friend the insula.\nSo this is a study that\nexplored what brain areas\nand what body areas are\nactivated by specific forms\nof attachment and social touch.\nAnd what they found not\nsurprisingly is that the areas\nof the brain that are\nassociated with touch,\nthe somatosensory areas,\nbut more interestingly,\nthe insular cortex are\nstrongly activated by touch.\nSo touch in the amount of\ntouching, and proximity,\nand skin contact, not\nsurprisingly activates brain areas\nassociated with somatosensory, touch,\nbut also the insular cortex, which again,\nis this brain area that links the internal\nor feelings about what's\ngoing on inside us\nand at the surface of our\nskin with events external.\nAnd they found activation\nof a number of brain areas,\nthe amygdala, orbitofrontal\ncortex, and so on and so on.\nThat's not as essential\nas just understanding\nthat the insular is the place\nin which we start to take\nour experience of our internal landscape,\nattach that to our perceptions\nof the external landscape,\nand then assign that\na value or assign that\nsome sort of interpretation.\nAnd positive delusion is\npredictive of long-term attachment.\nWhat do we mean by positive delusion?\nPositive delusion is the contradiction\nof that George Bernard Shaw quote.\nIt's the belief that only this person\ncan make me feel this way.\nThis other person holds the\ncapacity to make me feel\nthis way physically or\nemotionally or both.\nAnd so, as we move from\ndesire to love to attachment,\nour brain circuitry is literally\ngetting tuned up such that\nthat individual that we\nhappen to be attached to,\nagain, here thinking about\nmonogamous relationships,\nbut I guess for non-monogamous\nrelationship individuals\nis and are the way in which\nour autonomic nervous system\ncan be regulated.\nThey actually get access\nto our control panel.\nSo it's our autonomic\nnervous system empathy\nand this positive delusion.\nNow positive delusion is critical.\nIf you look at the stability\nof relationships over time,\nsomething that's been extensively studied\nmainly by psychologists, but\nnow also by neurobiologists,\nwhat you find is that\nthere are some key features\nof interactions between\nindividuals that predict\nthat a relationship will last.\nAnd those are many,\nbut mainly fall under this\ncategory of positive delusions.\nI'll return to those in what\nthose exactly look like.\nBut there are also just a\nhandful of things that predict\nthat a relationship will fail over time.\nThis is largely the work of the Gottman's,\nis actually a husband and wife team\nup at the University of\nWashington in Seattle.\nThe Gottman's have, run a laboratory\nin the department of\npsychology for a long time.\nThey've also done a lot of public facing\nwork around relationships.\nAnd they've talked about\nthe various aspects\nof relationships and\ninteractions between people\nthat predict either staying\ntogether or breaking up.\nSo much so that they've\nestablished a method\nby which they can look at video\ninteractions between couples\nand with very high degree\nof certainty predict\nwhether or not those\ncouples will stay together\nor break up over time.\nAnd they've identified what they call\nthe four horsemen of relationships.\nThese are things that essentially,\nalmost always predict that\na couple will break up.\nAnd I think the current\nnumber on this is that Gottman\ncan predict divorce with 94% accuracy,\nwhich if you think about\nis pretty remarkable.\nSo even though these are\npurely psychological studies,\nI'm not aware of any analysis\nof underlying physiology,\nthere are some things that they\ncan observe between couples\nthat can lead them to predict\nwhether or not a couple\nwill stay together or\nbreak up with 94% accuracy.\nSo what are those things?\nThose four behaviors, what\nthey call the Four Horsemen\nof the Apocalypse\n[laughs] for relationships\nare one, criticism, two,\ndefensiveness, three, stonewalling,\nand four, contempt, with\ncontempt being the most powerful\npredictor of breaking up.\nCriticism, of course, does\nnot mean that there's no place\nfor criticism in stable relationships.\nOf course, there is.\nHas to do with how\nfrequent and how intensely\nthat criticism is voiced.\nDefensiveness, of\ncourse, is defensiveness.\nWe know as the lack of\nability to hear another\nor to adopt their stance.\nSo lack of empathy,\nI think is one way to\ninterpret defensiveness.\nStonewalling, which is\nactually another form\nof lack of empathy.\nIt's a turning off of this neural circuit\nthat's so critical for\ndesire, love and attachment.\nThe stonewalling essentially\nmeans the emotional response\nor the request of another\nis completely cut off.\nSo it's, I don't think there's\nbeen brain imaging of this,\nbut I think, we can reasonably\nimagine that it involves\nuntethering your insular\nresponse from the other\nand what they're dealing with,\nand focusing your insular response,\n[giggles] no pun intended,\non your own internal state\nor perhaps the state of\nsomeone else entirely.\nI'll talk about infidelity in a moment.\nAnd then contempt.\nAnd contempt has actually been referred\nto as the sulfuric acid of relationship.\nI didn't say that, but\nGottman and colleagues have.\nThat it is such a powerful predictor\nof divorce and breakups in the future.\nAnd contempt, of course, by\ndefinition is the feeling\nthat a person or thing\nis beneath consideration,\nworthlessness or deserving scorn.\nAnd apparently they can\nidentify this in the videos\nof couples having\ndiscussions and interacting\nby very elaborate eye rolls,\nby expressions of anger\nin one individual when their\npartner is actually expressing\nenthusiasm or excitement about something.\nIt's the, oh yeah, you would say that,\nor deep seated resentment\ntoward the other,\nso much so that it's apparent\nthat one actively dislikes\nthe other partner.\nSo contempt, disregard for\nsomething that should be taken\ninto account is the other\nway to think about it.\nThat runs counter to all\nof the neural circuits,\nall three of the neural circuits\nthat we talked about before.\nIt certainly, it is the\nantithesis of empathy.\nIt is anything but a positive delusion.\nIt's really looking at\nthe other individual,\neither accurately or inaccurately\nas somebody that you despise.\nAnd then it is an absolute\ninversion of the autonomic\nseesaw matching that I\nwas talking about before.\nIt's a dissociating of your\nseesaw from their seesaw.\nThey're very excited about something,\nyou're unexcited by it.\nIn fact, it's an inversion of their seesaw\nwhere they're excited, you're down.\nThey're down, you are up, okay?\nSo it's basically an inversion\nof all of the neural circuits\nthat Helen Fisher and others\nhave identified as critical\nfor desire, love, and attachment.\nAnd therefore it's not\nsurprising that it is so strongly\npredictive of breakups,\nand in the case of married\ncouples, of divorce.\nFor those of you that are\ninterested in the work\nof the Gottman's and similar work,\nthey've written several popular books.\nThey're fairly easy to find.\nWe can link to one of\nthose in the caption.\nBut they've also developed\nsome quite interesting online resources\nin their so-called Love Lab.\nI guess it's fortunate that\nthey didn't call it the Hate Lab\nor the Breakup Lab,\n'cause they focused a lot\non what predicts breakups.\nBut they've also written\nextensively and researched\nextensively in peer-reviewed studies\nwhat makes people find\nappropriate partners for them,\nand to maintain those\npartnerships over time.\nSo you can go, you can\nsearch for Love Lab,\nUniversity of Washington, Gottman,\nor any number of their various books.\nI think you'll find some\nuseful resources there.\nI want to shift back to\nthe work of Helen Fisher.\nShe's made some very\ninteresting statements\nand some very interesting observations\nthat at least to my mind map very well\nonto the knowledge of neural\ncircuitry both in humans\nand in non-human primates\nand in other species.\nI realize that she's the\nonly name in the game.\nBut she's made some observations\nthat I think are very,\nas we say, parsimonious, meaning\nthey allow us to organize\na lot of this stuff into\nsome distinct frameworks.\nNow, she's also done some\nreally beautiful studies\nthat involve data from millions\nor even tens of millions\nof individuals on dating sites.\nSo I'm going to share\nthose with you in a moment.\nBut before I do that, I just\nwant to paraphrase Dr. Fisher,\nwho said that sex drive\nor desire that the pursuit\nof someone to mate with,\nmeaning to mate, the verb,\nnot necessarily to find a mate, may be,\nshe didn't say definitively,\nbut may be a way to forage\nfor potential love partners\nthat the arc of this\nwhole business is really the\norder that we're describing it,\nthat it's desire, then\nlove, and then attachment.\nAnd that oftentimes\npeople can get confused.\nYou may know some of these people,\nyou may be one of these individuals\nwho might confuse desire\nfor attachment or might\nconfuse love for attachment,\nbut that there's a sequence of recruitment\nof these neural circuits\nthat's established first\nfrom the pursuit of someone to mate with.\nAnd she's placed us in the\ncontext of more modern dating\nthemes where depending on\nculture, people might explore\nseveral, maybe many,\nmany individuals before,\nquote, unquote, settling\ndown with somebody,\nat least for some period of time.\nI think that's an interesting framework\nbecause it circumvents a lot\nof the, frankly, unanswerable\nquestions about whether\nor not humans were meant\nto be monogamous or whether\nor not they weren't.\nThose are conversations\nthat hold cultural context,\nthat hold all sorts of context,\nthat really can't be addressed\nin a laboratory setting.\nBut this idea that sex\ndrive is a way to forage\nfor potential love partners\nand that love is a litmus test\nfor whether or not longer\nterm or deeper attachments\ncan and will form, is one that\nat least makes sense to me.\nLater in the episode, we'll\ntalk about this notion\nof sex drive and desire.\nI'll actually talk about some\ntools that have very strong\ndata really to support them\nin terms of things that people\ncan do or take to increase\nlibido, both men and women,\nbecause there's actually\nquite good data on that now.\nBut in the meantime, I want\nto talk about some of the work\nthat Dr. Fisher has done in terms\nof categorizing people into...\nAgain, we have four groups.\nThese are distinct from the A, B, C, and D\nattachment styles described earlier.\nAlthough as I describe them,\nyou might be able to map\nthem somewhat onto those.\nAnd these four groups are\ngroups that were defined\nthrough her studies of\npeople that were, or are,\nI don't know if they were or\nif they are still on match.com,\nbut a very extensive dataset.\nSo again, millions if not tens\nof millions of individuals.\nThe number I heard her quote,\nand forgive me if this is not accurate,\nis that in upwards of\n40 million individuals,\nin terms of whether or\nnot their neurochemical\nand hormone systems are tuned\ntoward particular types of behaviors.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, both men and\nwomen, males and females\nhave both testosterone and estrogen.\nTypically, again, these\nare averages, but typically\nmen have more testosterone\nthan they do estrogen,\nand they have more\ntestosterone than do women,\nand less estrogen then do women.\nTypically women have more estrogen\nthan they do testosterone,\nagain, averages.\nAnd they have less testosterone than men,\nmore estrogen than men,\nand so on and so forth.\nBut both hormone systems are active\nin both sets of individuals.\nAnd of course, all\nhumans, as far as we know,\nmanufacture both dopamine and serotonin.\nDopamine, as I mentioned\nearlier, has a number of effects\nin the brain and body.\nBut one of the primary\neffects is that it places us\ninto states of motivation and\npursuit for various things.\nThere is somewhat close\nrelationship between the dopamine\nsystem and the testosterone\nsystem in the hypothalamus,\nthis brain area above\nthe roof of your mouth.\nAnd the pituitary gland,\nwhich is responsible\nfor making hormones that make\nthe ovaries and or testes,\nsecrete testosterone or estrogen.\nSo there's a lot of signaling\nthat occurs such that dopamine\nand testosterone tend to\noperate as close cousins\nin a system of pursuit.\nAnd conversely, the serotonin\nsystem tends to on average\ncollaborate with the estrogen\nsystem to impart certain\nphysiological functions and behaviors.\nSo these aren't hard and fast,\nor I guess better stated,\nthese aren't strict black\nand white categorizations,\nbut I think those general themes hold\nwhen you look at the\nanimal and human data.\nSo Dr. Fisher has taken some\nliberties, but I think they are\nwhat I would call logically,\nand scientifically,\nand neurobiologically grounded liberties\nin classifying individuals\nwho are on these dating sites\naccording to the types\nof things they report\nabout themselves and the\ntype of people they tend\nto match with on these dating sites,\nand created these four categories.\nThe four categories are, she calls one,\nthe dopamine category.\nSo these are people who\nwould have high dopamine.\nAnd again, that's just a name.\nIt doesn't mean they\nhave low anything else,\nbut they are high on the dopamine scale.\nPeople who rate high on the\ndopamine scale tend to be\nwhat the scientists and psychologists call\nhigh sensation seeking, novel seeking.\nThey like new things,\nthey like spontaneity,\nthey tend to be very adventurous.\nAnd I think that's largely true.\nIf you look at the conditions\nwhere dopamine is super physiological,\nit's elevated beyond abnormal levels.\nThings like mania or when\npeople take certain drugs\nof abuse, like cocaine or amphetamine\nthat really raise dopamine\nlevels up very, very high.\nFor some period of time,\nthey do tend to increase\nenergy motivation and novelty seeking.\nAnd of course, drugs like\namphetamine and cocaine\nhave all sorts of deleterious effects\nthat I don't need to go into here,\nbut it's worth pointing out.\nBut they don't tend to make\npeople calm and relaxed\nand seek soothing interactions.\nConversely, the group\nthat Dr. Fisher calls\nthe serotonin group\ntend to be more grounded\nin soothing activities,\nquiescent type activities.\nThey actually tend to be, on average,\nthey tend to like rules and follow rules,\nthey tend to be homebodies,\nthis sort of thing.\nThey're really, you can\nimagine them this stable types,\nbut they really like stability.\nThey're not really into\nspontaneity as much,\nagain, averages.\nAnd then she created two other categories,\nthe testosterone category\nof high testosterone.\nThis again, could be males or females.\nAnd then the estrogen category,\nagain, could be males or females.\nAnd she gave these different names\nthat I won't go into here.\nYou can look up her work online,\nbut she names like the\ndirector, and the follower,\nand things like that.\nBut I don't really want to use\nthose as much as I want to stick\nto the biological terms.\nSo we have dopamine, serotonin,\ntestosterone, and estrogen.\nNow that might seem like an\nunfair overgeneralization,\nbut what's interesting is\nnot necessarily the name\nor the neurochemical system, right?\nThose could have just been\ncalled category one, two, three\nand four for all that matters here.\nWhat is interesting is seeing\nhow those different groups\nof individuals that she\nabsolutely can categorize\nbased on their self-reported preferences\nabout behaviors and certain\nkinds of interactions.\nHow those groups tend\nto pair up with people\nin the same or opposite categories.\nSo what her studies reveal\nis that people that fall\ninto the high sensation\nseeking, novelty seeking,\nspontaneity category,\nthe one that she calls\nthe high dopamine category\ntend to pair up with, at least\nin the short term, tend\nto pair up with people\nwho are also in that\ndopaminergic category.\nSo these would be people\nthat would spontaneously\ntake a trip or explore\nsomething new or new restaurant.\nThey tend to be creative\nand explorative types.\nSo that group on average\ntends to date and mate,\nand potentially form long-term\nrelationships within category.\nAgain, averages.\nIndividuals that she placed\ninto the serotonin group\nor what she hypothesized would\nbe a high serotonin group,\nagain, they didn't measure serotonin,\nbut people that tend to place\nvalue on stability, on rules,\non certain forms of\ntraditional organization\nat home and in relationships,\nthose people also tended to\npair up with select date,\nwe presume mate with and\nform stable relationships\nwith people in the same category.\nNow, individuals in the\nother two categories,\nthe high testosterone group,\nand again, testosterone wasn't measured,\nbut she called it the\nhigh testosterone group,\nbut these are people that\ntend to be very directive,\nthey tend to know what they\nwant and are comfortable telling\nother people what they want.\nAnd from them, these are\nindividuals that in her studies\nand in other studies tend to\nbe a little bit challenging,\nmeaning they not necessarily\nchallenging to be around,\nbut they tend to challenge other people,\npush them in order to\nexpand their boundaries,\neither for sake of the\nrelationship or just in general.\nAnd the people they tend\nto push are the people that\nthey pair up with, which are the people\nin the estrogen category,\nwhat she called high estrogen.\nAgain, they didn't measure estrogen,\nbut the people in the estrogen\ncategory were the ones\nthat described themselves\nand their choices in life\nand their preferences as being nurturing.\nThey actually seem to\nlike it when someone else\nis making the major\ndecisions, not every decision.\nThey certainly like to\nbe heard, of course,\nin terms of their preferences.\nBut that those two types, what\nshe called the testosterone\nand the estrogen type tend to pair up.\nSo why are these categorizations\nand these averages interesting to me,\nat least interesting\nenough to convey to you?\nThe reason they're interesting to me is,\nagain, not because of their names,\nthese molecules were not\nmeasured in these individuals,\nbut that they once again\nbring us to the themes\nthat we addressed before,\nwhich are the autonomic nervous\nsystem and whether or not\nit tends to be shifted more\ntowards alertness in action\nor more towards a stable\nequilibrium or more towards calm,\nand whether or not individuals\nare selecting for people\nwho have autonomic nervous\nsystems that are more or less\nlike theirs before they even meet, right?\nSo again, going back\nto this seesaw analogy,\nit's almost like people\nwho have the flat seesaw,\nalert but calm, but not extremely alert,\nnot extremely overly calm in\nsituations but in the middle,\nseem to be seeking out\npeople that are also\nat that autonomic equilibrium.\nPeople in the, what she\ncalled the dopamine category,\nwhich are really can just be described\nas high sensation\nseeking, novelty seeking,\nthey seem to want to\npair with one another.\nSo there's a selection for similar,\nin two of the groups, autonomic tone.\nI find that very interesting\nbecause in that decision\nor that preference for\nsimilar autonomic tone,\nit essentially eliminates\na lot of the requirement\nfor figuring out how to match\none's autonomic nervous system to another.\nThey simply find someone with\na similar tendency, okay?\nWhereas in the other two\ngroups that she called\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nthe director type\nand the nurturing somewhat follower type,\nthere's an establishment of balance,\nbut not in between two who\nindividuals as a match,\nbut rather on the whole\nin the relationship.\nOne person is driving the novelty seeking\nin the course of decisions and actions,\nand the other person is\nessentially agreeing to those.\nNow, assuming that those decisions\nare good for both people.\nAnd I emphasize good for both people,\nbecause one of the themes\nthat Dr. Fisher underscores,\nand I'd like to underscore here as well,\nis that it need not be the\ncase that people pair up\nexactly according to these categorizations\nthat I've described,\ndopamine with dopamine,\nserotonin with serotonin,\ntestosterone with estrogen,\nand so on.\nWhat is important is that\nthere be a recognition\nand a respect for the other types,\nor a recognition and a\nrespect for the fact that\nboth are of the same type.\nYou could actually imagine,\nfor instance, that two people\nof this high sensation\nseeking, novelty seeking\ncould have a terrifically\nexciting relationship,\nbut that it actually\nmight be a relationship\nin which the financial\nstability isn't quite there,\nor in which the basic\nstability isn't there.\nYou could imagine, for\ninstance, a situation\nin which a relationship between two people\nof what she called the\nhigh serotonin preference\nwould have a relationship\nthat was actually dull,\nin which both of them found\nthemselves bored at some point,\nor in which there wasn't\nenough of the dynamic tension\nthat sometimes is required\nin order to keep this cycle\nof desire, love, and attachment going.\nSomething that we will\ntalk about in a moment.\nSo the point here is not that\none should necessarily pair up\naccording to these\narrangements that I described.\nThe point is that on average,\nthat's what tends to happen.\nAnd that through a recognition\nthat these categorizations\nexist similar to the\nrecognition that the type\nA, B, C, and D infant and\ntoddler type attachments exist,\nthat we can gain better\nself-awareness of who we are\nand how we tend to show up\nin romantic attachments,\nand thereby navigate\nhealthier mate seeking,\nhealthier breakups, if\nthe case dictates it,\nand in some cases healthy\nlong-term relationships\nby understanding that the other\nperson can either be similar\nor complimentary to us.\nOne is neither better than the other.\nIt's simply the case that\nin all romantic attachments,\nfrom the initial inception\nof the romantic attachment,\ndesire, love, and attachment,\nthere is an autonomic coordination.\nAnd of course there's\ncoordination of all sorts\nof other things like food,\nsex, and sleep, and finances,\nand where people are going to\nlive, and many other features,\nbut that at the core of\nall that is a seeking\nof either autonomic likeness\nor autonomic differences.\nAnd I think that recognition\ncan be extremely valuable\nin thinking about tools to enter\nand maintain relationships.\nIf one thinks about their\nautonomic nervous system,\nnot simply as something that\nis driven by external people\nand events, but that we can\nactually gain some control over\nthrough techniques of the sort\nthat I talked about earlier\nand on previous podcasts,\nbut also generally, if\nwe are able to adjust\nour autonomic nervous system\nin order to at least appreciate\nor get some empathy into what\nsomeone else is experiencing,\nthen we gain actual cognitive empathy.\nAnd this episode isn't\nabout empathy per se,\nbut the theme keeps\ncoming up again and again.\nAnd I think it's worth\nmentioning that when you talk\nto psychologists, whether\nor not they're psychoanalyst\nor from another source of training,\nwhat you find is that they\ndon't talk about empathy\nas a general term, they will\ntalk about emotional empathy,\nthey'll talk about cognitive empathy.\nAnd what I'm talking\nabout here today is that\nyet a third category that\nis very strongly determinant\nof relationship dynamics,\nand that's autonomic empathy.\nI'm a biologist, I'm not a psychologist.\nSo I love mechanism.\nAnd fortunately there are\nstudies that have been done\nrecently using modern techniques\nto look at neural mechanisms\nof romantic attachment.\nI mentioned earlier some of\nthe brain imaging studies\nthat have been done on child\nand mother literally imaging\nthe activity of neurons in\nthe brain as child is nursing,\nor as a mother is soothing baby,\nand as you learned earlier,\nbaby is soothing mother as well.\nThose are remarkable studies.\nYou may have seen some\nof these pictures online.\nYou can see the silhouette\nof the infant and mother,\nand their brains and even\nsome of the brain activation\npatterns, really, really\nbeautiful studies.\nSimilar studies have been\ndone in romantic couples\nwith those couples, either\ntouching one another,\ntouching and kissing,\nor in clever, I think,\ncontrol experiments of the\nperson just touching a pillow,\n[laughs] or something, or kissing a pillow\nin order to try and create\nthe most reasonable control\nfor what are actually pretty\ncomplicated interpersonal dynamics\nto do in a brain imaging scanner.\nBut some of the other studies\nthat have been done recently\ninvolved so called EEG.\nSo these are electrical recordings\nthat are done noninvasively,\nputting a bunch of electrodes\non the outside of the scalp.\nEEG is useful in that you\ncan do it noninvasively,\nyou can do it while people\nare moving and doing things,\nkissing, touching, et cetera.\nIt doesn't allow one to image\nor to evaluate neural activity\nvery deeply in the brain.\nSo you can miss out on a lot of things.\nIt's like looking at the\nwave structure on the ocean\nwithout actually looking\ninto the depths of the ocean.\nSo you can miss certain things,\nbut if you see things generally\nyou trust they're there,\nbut you can't see what you don't see.\nNonetheless, there's some studies\nthat I'll just point you\nto and that form the segue\nfor what I'm going to discuss in a moment,\nwhich is a study published in\nScientific Reports in 2021,\nentitled \"Investigating Real Life Emotions\nin Romantic Couples: a Mobile EEG Study.\"\nSo this is, as the title\nsuggests, having people wear\nthese EEG caps of electrodes,\nget engage in very passionate,\nemotional kisses, emotional\nspeech toward one another\nstanding at different distances.\nSo a lot of cool stuff that\nyou can do that you really\ncouldn't do in a brain scanner,\nbecause in a brain scanner,\npeople have to be there\nusually in a bite bar,\nthey're actually jaw flicked like this.\nI've been in one of these things.\nThere's not a lot of\nmoving around to be heard,\nat least not using the current technology.\nIn any case, what they found was\nthere is a shift in brain\nwaves, brain states,\nthings like alpha waves or\njust a particular frequency\nof brain waves in the\nneocortex, the outer shell\nof the brain just beneath the skull.\nAnd in people that are kissing\nor in people that are engaged\nin romantic speech, or I didn't\nactually hear what they said\nto one another, but what\nthe couple seems exciting,\nromantic and arousing to\nthem, they see more alpha wave\nactivity compared to\nthe control conditions.\nAnd there was some what\nwe call lateralization,\nwhere the left hemisphere was\nmore active than the right\nand so forth.\nAnd these studies are\nimportant because we know that\nthe autonomic nervous\nsystems of individuals tend\nto start to collaborate\nand actually synchronize\nat the level of heartbeats,\nat the level of breathing\nduring romantic interactions\nof different kinds.\nBut these studies are some of the first\nof their kind to start looking\nat neural synchronization\nbetween individuals.\nNow, the simple version of looking at this\nand the way I would've\nthought this would all go was,\nokay, two people start\nkissing, they start talking\nabout what they find particularly romantic\nand arousing for them.\nAnd their brain waves will\njust match to one another.\nAnd that's really the basis\nof romantic attachment\nand romantic engagement\nin that sort of thing.\nBut it turns out that\nthe opposite is true.\nSo a really nice study published\nin a really fine journal,\nCerebral Cortex is a\njournal that I've known\nabout for many years, they\npublished strong anatomy,\nphysiology and neuroimaging.\nThere's a study that was\npublished, first author, Kajimura,\nand this paper really points...\nAgain, this is 2021.\nAnd the title of this paper is,\n\"Brain Knows Who Is on\nthe Same Wavelength:\nResting-State Connectivity\nCan Predict Compatibility\nof a Female-Male Relationship.\"\nNow what this study did\nwas a little bit different.\nThey looked at the resting or default mode\nactivity of the brain.\nSo rather than evoked\nactivity, as it's called,\nwhere people are kissing or\nare engaged in some activity,\nthis was a neuroimaging\nstudy, not EEG, but fMRI,\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging,\nwhich is similar to EEG in principle,\nbut allows you to look\ndeep into the brain.\nAnd it has a very good\nresolution in time and space.\nSo fast events can be monitored\nand the precise location\nof those events can be monitored\nsomewhat better than EEG.\nAnd there are exceptions to this.\nSo for you EEGers out there.\nEEG don't come after me with electrodes.\nJust understand that fMRI\ngives you a fuller picture\nof what's going on.\nAnd what Kajimura et al\nfound was that contrary\nto what your reflexive\nprediction might be,\npeople tend to select people\nthat have resting brain states\nthat different than theirs,\nor sometimes they found\nthat are actually opposite\nto their own resting brain state.\nAnd you might say, \"Well,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\nI thought this is all about\nautonomic coordination.\"\nBut actually if we go back to\nHelen Fisher's categorizations\nof the dopamine types, the\nsensation seeking types,\nthat is serotonin, the\nstable rule following types,\ntestosterone and estrogen types,\nremember that the two\ncategories that she called\ntestosterone and estrogen type,\nthe director and the\nfollower, the nurturer,\nI guess it would be the more accurate way,\nthe director and the nurturer,\nthose tend to pair up across categories,\nnot within category.\nAnd so I think what's\nreally needed for this field\nwhich to my knowledge hasn't happened yet,\nis to really start to\nmap the neuroanatomical\nand neurophysiological\nfindings of, in this case,\nthat resting brain state is\nin one form in one individual,\nand they tend to seek out\npeople whose resting brain state\nis different than theirs, not similar.\nThat needs to be mapped\nonto the more subjective\npsychological categorizations\nthat Helen Fisher\nand indeed the Gottman's\nand others have created,\nthat sort of the state of the field now.\nAnd I mentioned this not to confuse you,\nbut to the contrary, to\nillustrate that it's not just\nabout finding someone just like you,\nand it's not just about finding someone\nwho's opposite to you.\nThis is actually the reason\nthat I decided to become\na biologist at some point\nin my life, which is that\nwe can find verbal sayings,\nand stories, and examples\nto support just about anything.\nThis is not a knock on\nthe field of psychology,\nas you can probably tell\nfrom today's episode.\nI have great respect for in reverence\nfor the field of psychology,\nespecially its collaboration\nwith neuroscience and vice versa.\nBut in the popular culture,\nwe can find examples and\nsayings that support essentially\nanything as it relates to a relationship.\nFor instance, I've heard\nand you've probably heard,\nabsence makes the heart grow fonder.\nAnd indeed I've experienced\nthat and I believe it's true.\nBut I also have experienced\nand I believe to be true\nthat out of sight out of mind also exists\nand that there will be a\nbiological mechanism for that.\nThe point here is that\nmatching of same to same\nor same to different can\nboth be effective in creating\nthe desire, love, attachment process.\nIt's a matter of, who is looking for same,\nand who is looking for different?\nAnd there, I think Dr. Fisher and the work\nof these neurophysiologist\nand brain imagers\nreally does point in a direction whereby\nthere is not one form of attachment\nthat is going to be\nwholly above [indistinct]\nwill predict good outcomes.\nThere is not going to be a case\nin which opposites attract,\nand that's always the best rule to follow.\nSometimes it will, sometimes it won't.\nThere is also not the\ncase that people tend\nto pair up with similar.\nSometimes it will be the\ncase, sometimes it won't.\nNow there are certain statistics\nthat support that statement.\nFor instance, people, on average,\npeople pair up with individuals\nof similar educational\nbackground, income, and attractiveness.\nThat is true on average, but\nit's not always the case.\nAnd again, a knowledge of and\na respect for the different\ncategorizations of attachment,\nthe different categorizations\nof mate seeking described\nby Fisher and others,\nand the recognition that\nmatching of autonomic nervous\nsystems but also mismatching\nof resting state brain networks\nare all at play in driving\nwhat we are calling\ndesire, love and attachment.\nSo in keeping with the\nexploration of the fact that\nthere's a saying, or a book,\nor a song, or an example\nof pretty much any relationship dynamic,\nI want to now talk about an\narticle that came out a little\nover 10 years ago that talked\nabout the universality of love\nand the ability to fall in love.\nSo this would be very much in line\nwith the George Bernard Shaw\nquote that I mentioned earlier\nthat \"Love is really overestimating\nthe differences between individuals.\"\nAnd again, I should say\nthat is not something\nthat I personally believe,\nalthough maybe I'm just diluting myself.\nI like to think that the\npeople that we fall in love\nwith are really special for us,\nthat they could not easily be\nreplaced with anybody else.\nThat's simply my stance.\nI'm not basing that\non any hardcore neurobiological mechanism.\nBut nonetheless, an article was published\nin The New York Times in 2015 that related\nto some psychological\nstudies that were done,\nas well as some clinical\nwork, as well as some,\nwhat I would call pop\npsychology or things that fall\noutside the domains of academic science.\nAnd the whole basis of this article was\n36 questions that lead to love.\nAnd it involved a listing\nout indeed of 36 questions,\ndivided into set one, set two,\nand set three that progressed\nfrom somewhat ordinary\nquestions about life experience\nand self-report to more,\nlet's call them deep questions\nabout people's values\nand things that are\nemotionally close to them.\nAnd I'll just give an\nexample of a few of these.\nYou can find this easily\nonline by just putting\ninto your search engine, 36\nquestions that lead to love.\nSome of the questions in set\nnumber one, where for instance,\nwhat would constitute\na perfect day for you?\nFor what in your life do\nyou feel most grateful?\nKind of standard questionnaire stuff.\nIn set two, what is your\nmost treasured memory?\nWhat is your most terrible memory?\nSo these, as you can tell, are\ndrilling a little bit deeper\ninto one's personal experience\nand emotional system.\nAnd then set three, questions\n25 through 36 are things,\nwhat is a very embarrassing\nmoment in your life?\nWhen did you last cry in\nfront of another person\nand by yourself?\nWhat is something that's too\nserious to be joked about?\nSo it's going deeper into\none's emotional system.\nAnd even questions like, of\nall the people in your family,\nwhose death would you find\nmost disturbing and why?\nSo pretty, pretty heavy\nstuff there at the end.\nNow, the reason this article\ngot so much traction,\nand the reason I'm bringing\nit up today is that\nthere was a statement that\nwas made in and around\nthis article that if two\npeople went on a date\nor simply sat down and asked\neach other these questions,\nand each answered these questions\nand the other was paying\nattention carefully and at some\nlevel emotionally responding\nor not out responding, but\ncertainly paying attention\nto the answers of the other person,\nthat by the end of that\nexchange, where one person asks\n36 questions and the other\nperson answers all 36,\nand then the other person asks\nall 36 and the other person\nanswers all 36, that they\nwould fall in love, right?\nWhich seems like a ridiculous thing.\nAnd yet it is the case that people who go\nthrough this exercise report\nfeeling as if they know\nthe other person quite well\nand feeling certain levels\nof attachment or even love and\ndesire for the other person\nthat they were, would not\nhave predicted, excuse me,\nwould not have predicted\nhad they not gone through that process.\nSo what's going on in\nthis exchange of questions\nand answers of a\nprogressively more emotional\nand deep level?\nWell, what I predict is\ngoing on is that inside\nof that exchange, people are\ncreating a delusional story\nabout the nature of the\nexchange being a reflection\nof some deeper attachment.\nAnd so even though people\nare just exchanging words,\nthey're not physically touching,\nthey are not, at least not\nat the point where they're\nrunning these kinds\nof questionnaire studies.\nThey may touch afterwards for all I know,\nand probably did in some cases,\nbut they're not exchanging life experience\nin an immediate way.\nThey're not actually\ngoing off into the world\nand doing things together yet.\nThey are simply exchanging narrative.\nBut we know based on recent\nstudies and I've covered\nthis before on this podcast,\nbut I'll mention again,\nthere was a study\npublished in Cell Reports,\na Cell Press journal, excellent journal\nshowing that when individuals\nlisten to the same narrative,\ntheir heart rates tend to synchronize\nor at least follow a very similar pattern,\neven if they're not in the same room\nlistening to a given narrative.\nWhereas in this case, people\nare facing one another\nlistening to the narratives of each other.\nCertainly they are having\nautonomic responses.\nAnd it stands to reason that\ntheir autonomic nervous systems\nare synchronizing much\nin the same way that\nthe Cell Report study found\nthat people will synchronize\ntheir autonomic nervous\nsystems to a shared,\nheard story from another.\nIn other words, whether\nor not we hear a story,\nwatch a movie, listen to a song,\nor exchange our own individual stories,\nour autonomic nervous\nsystems have the potential\nto map onto one another.\nSo I'm not all that\nsurprised that people find\nthat they fall in love, in quotes,\nafter answering these\nquestions to one another,\nbecause essentially\nthe way these questions\nare laid out is they\nestablish a narrative.\nThey establish a very personal narrative\nand the other person is\nlistening very closely.\nAnd we don't have physiological\nor brain imaging studies\nto support what I'm about to say,\nbut the reasonable interpretation is that\nthat's causing some\nautonomic synchronization.\nSo if you want to try this on\na date or even it's actually\nbeen hypothesized that\nthis could be useful\nfor existing couples, even if\nthey already know the answers\nto some of these questions.\nAnd that doesn't surprise me either.\nI think the autonomic\ncoordination is present\nduring mating behavior,\nit's present during shared\nexperience of the outside world,\nmovies, concerts, watching one's children\nwith somebody else, et cetera.\nAnd it's established by\nsharing one's own narrative\nof their own personal experience.\nSo I don't want to seem\noverly reductionist.\nI'll never propose that all\nof our sensation, perception,\naction and experience in life\nboils down to us just being\nbags of chemicals and the\naction of those chemicals,\nor any aspect of our nervous system.\nAnd yet in looking across\nthe psychological literature\nof development of attachment,\nin the psychological\nliterature of adult and\nromantic attachment,\nand what makes and\nbreaks those attachments,\nit's very clear to me.\nAnd I think courses through\nthe literature multiple levels,\nthat autonomic coordination\nis absolutely key\nfor the establishment of\ndesire, love and attachment.\nIn fact, I talked earlier\nabout how our actual conception\nis born out of autonomic coordination\nof one sort or another.\nSo again, it doesn't necessarily\nmean that autonomic nervous\nsystems always be synchronized\nin the case of the two\ncategorizations that Fisher proposed\nof the director/testosterone type\nand the nurturing follower/estrogen type.\nIt was actually the coordination\nbut in opposite directions\nof individuals that fall\ninto each of those categories\nthat led to more stable attachments\nor the seeking out of those\nattachments, I should say.\nBut nonetheless, it's, at\nleast to my mind, very clear\nthat autonomic coordination\nis a hallmark feature\nof desire, a hallmark\nfeature of what we call love,\nand a hallmark feature of\nwhat we call attachment.\nAnd that the breaking of\nattachments were the failures\nof desire, the failures of love,\nand the failures of attachment over time\nin line with the work\nof Gottman and others.\nAnd in even just simply what's\nrequired for mating behavior\nis also reflected in the\nautonomic nervous system.\nBut in that case, a failure to coordinate\nthe autonomic nervous systems\nin some sort of concerted way.\nAny discussion about\ndesire, love, and attachment\nwould be incomplete\nif we didn't talk about the\ndreaded infidelity and cheating.\nMuch has been made of\ninfidelity and cheating\nand whether or not people\nwho are higher on dopamine\nand sensation seeking tend\nto cheat more or less.\nFrankly, I don't think there's\nany solid evidence for that.\nI think there are a lot of\nexamples that we can draw\nfrom in our own lives and\nin the lives of others\nthat would generally support\none or the other model,\nbut I'm not aware of any\ndecent physiological studies\nor psychological studies\nthat really point to that.\nFor instance, I would never\nsay that the serotonergic\nphenotype as described by\nFisher is less prone to cheat,\nor that the people who\nhave an insecure attachment\nare more likely to cheat,\net cetera, for instance.\nI don't think those\ncorrelations have been drawn\nin any kind of meaningful way yet.\nSo I would be cautious\nabout assigning them\nwithout that evidence.\nHowever, there are some\ninteresting studies involving,\nagain, neuroimaging and some\nsubjective measures in humans,\nmeaning asking them questions\nthat they're good ways to\ntease out lies from truths\nin these sorts of studies and\nwhether or not people tend\nto find their partner or\nothers more or less attractive\ndepending on how people\nfeel about themselves.\nAnd I think this is a\nvery interesting aspect\nto desire, love, and attachment\nfor the following reason.\nYou hear a lot out out there that in order\nto form a really strong relationship,\nyou have to have a good\nrelationship with yourself,\nor you have to love yourself.\nOr you often hear for instance\nthat it's exactly when you're\nnot looking for a relationship\nthat you're going to find one.\nYou hear this stuff, right?\nBut none of that is really\ngrounded in any studies.\nAgain, that's like out\nof sight out of mind,\nor absence makes the heart grow fonder.\nThere are many life examples\nto support those statements.\nAnd there are many life examples\nto support statements to the opposite.\nThere's a particular study that I found.\nThis was published in\nFrontiers in Psychology,\nbut it's a experimental study\nthat involves neuroimaging.\nThe title of this study is\n\"Manipulation of Self-Expansion\nAlters Responses to Attractive\nAlternative Partners.\"\nAnd I love the design of this study.\nWhat they did in this\nstudy is they took couples\nand they evaluated members\nof that relationship\nfor what's called self-expansion.\nNow self-expansion is\na metric that involves\none's perception of self\nas seen through the\nrelationship to the other.\nAnd this is something\nthat was developed by,\nthe authors are Aron and Aron.\nSo they have the same last name.\nSo I'm assuming this was\neither a sibling team\nor a somehow related team\nor a romantic couple team.\nA-R-O-N and A-R-O-N,\nAron and Aron, in 1986,\nproposed this self-expansion\nmodel of close relationships.\nAnd they proposed \"That\npeople are motivated\nto enter relationships...\"\nI'm reading here.\n\"In order to enhance the self\nand increase self-efficacy.\"\nIn other words, that one of\nthe reasons why many people\nenter relationships is\nthat it makes us feel good\nabout ourselves and more capable.\nAnd I would see that as a\nhealthy interdependence,\nnot necessarily codependence.\nThis is especially strong at the beginning\nof a relationship, it turns out,\nwhen people are forming pair bonds,\nand it's the case that pleasure,\narousal and excitement,\nagain, all hallmark features\nof autonomic nervous system function,\npleasure, arousal and excitement,\ngive rise to self-expansion,\nmeaning to self-efficacy.\nSo what this self-expansion\nmodel is really about is\nhow great other people that we\nare close to and romantically\nattached to can potentially make us feel,\nin terms of what they say,\nin terms of what they do,\nin terms of the way in which\nwe believe they feel about us.\nSo it doesn't necessarily\nhave to involve explicit\nstatements of them telling\nus how great we are,\nor them doing great gestures for us,\nbut how we actually\nfeel they feel about us.\nTurns out to be a very\nstrong parameter in terms\nof how we feel about ourselves\nand the relationship overall.\nNow, some of you out there\nare probably thinking,\n\"Oh yeah, isn't there this thing\nof the love languages?\" Right?\nI don't have any neuroscience\nto support, I think,\nthe love languages, I'm not\nsuper familiar with this,\nand I didn't list it out,\nbut that some people are...\nTheir autonomic nervous\nsystem, if you will,\ntends to be very responsive\nto gifts, or to quality time,\nor to physical touch, or acts of kindness.\nI think I've got a few of these right.\nI probably have a few wrong.\nAnyway, they're easy to find online.\nAnd people do tend to have\na bias toward two or three\nof these things that are especially\nmeaningful for them.\nAnd when I hear meaningful,\nI hear they tend to push\nthe autonomic nervous system\nand neurochemical systems\nof the brain and body in a\ndirection that makes us feel good\nas opposed to lousy or neutral.\nIn any event, this study\nlooked at whether or not\npeople have high levels of self-expansion\nthrough the actions or statements\nof their significant other,\nand how that influences\ntheir perception of people\noutside the relationship.\nMeaning how attractive\nthey perceive people\noutside the relationship to be,\nturns out to be strongly influenced\nby, A, whether or not their\nself-expansion is very strongly\ndriven by the other person\nthat they are involved with,\nthat they're in the\nromantic relationship with,\nand whether or not that's\nbeing expressed to them.\nSo here's how the study went.\nFirst of all, they rated\nor categorized individuals\non the basis of the self-expansion metric.\nSome people have more of\na potential to experience\nself-expansion through others, right?\nSome of us feel great about\nourselves and we're topped off,\nthe others don't feel so\ngreat about themselves,\nbut they can feel much\nbetter in response to praise,\nin particular praise or\nself-expansion type behaviors\nor statements from people\nthat we really care about.\nAnd still other people\nare a mixture of the two.\nThey moderate levels of both.\nSo they rated them on this scale.\nAnd then they had people\nexperience self-expansion narratives.\nThey heard their significant\nothers say really terrific\nthings about them and about the\nrelationship, in particular,\nthat the relationship that\nthey have was exciting,\nnovel and challenging.\nSo that was one form of self-expansion.\nAnd they went into some detail\nas to why that was the case\nin their particular relationship.\nOr they heard a narrative\nfrom their significant other\nabout strong feelings\nof love between the two\nthat had been experienced\npreviously in the relationship.\nSo in the one case, it\ndirected more towards them.\nAnd in the other case,\nit's more about the relationship itself.\nAnd then they did brain\nimaging of one person\nin the relationship while\nthat person assessed\nthe attractiveness of people\noutside the relationship.\nAnd what they found was\nthat people who were primed\nfor this self-expansion had\nlower activation of brain areas\nassociated with assessing\nothers' attractiveness\nthan did the people who experienced\na lot of self-expansion.\nNow the takeaway from that,\nat least the way I read\nthe study is if you're with\nsomebody who really benefits\nfrom or experiences a\nlot of self-expansion,\nunless you really want\nthem to pay attention\nto the attractiveness of other people,\nit stands to reason\nthat they would benefit\nfrom more self-expansion type\ngestures or statements, okay?\nNot so much centered on the relationship.\nWe have such a great relationship.\nThere's so much love,\nit's so great, that too,\nbut in the context of this\nstudy and these findings,\nthat the person is really\nterrific, that the relationship\nthat they've created\ntogether is really exciting,\nnovel, and challenging, that\nthere's a narrative around\nthe relationship that\nreally has a lot to do\nwith the dynamics between the\nindividuals, in particular,\nthat the person who really\nlikes self-expansion\nis vital to that dynamic, okay?\nSo it's not looking\ndown at the relationship\nas a set of equals.\nThere is this bias\nwritten into this of that\nthis person is really\nessential for the relationship.\nI'm not saying this is\nsomething that anyone has to do.\nI'm not not saying this is right or wrong.\nThis is just what the data say.\nBut what's remarkable\nis that in the absence\nof those statements, people who have,\nor that rate high on this\nscale of self-expansion\nrate attractive alternative\npartners as more attractive.\nNow, that's interesting to\nme, because it may means that\ntheir actual perception\nof others is changing.\nIt's not that their opportunity\nto see others is changing, right?\nThis is not a matter of\nthem somehow getting access\nor no access to attractive\nalternative partners.\nAgain, attractive alternative partners,\nliterally the language in\nthe title of this paper,\nthey're still seeing all\nthese attractive people.\nIt's just that if they're\nfeeling filled up, in air quotes,\npsychologically filled\nup, emotionally filled up,\nautonomically filled,\nenhanced in the language\nthat we're using today by\nthe self-expansion narrative,\nwell then the same set of\nattractive faces appear\nless attractive to a given individual.\nNow, whether or not this\npredicts cheating or loyalty,\n[laughs] I certainly can't say.\nThat would be very hard\nto assess in neuroimaging.\nAnd there, of course,\npeople rarely if ever\nreport accurately their cheating behavior.\nThere's some studies in which\nconfidentiality is assured\nto the point where people\nseem to be more trusting\nand willing to reveal cheating behavior.\nBut if you look at the\nstatistics on cheating behavior,\nit's very hard to track\nbecause people lie all the time\nabout their cheating in\nand outside of the context\nof psychological and neuroimaging studies.\nBut I find this study, again, the title,\n\"Manipulation of\nSelf-expansion Alters Responses\nto Attractive Alternative Partners\"\nto be absolutely fascinating,\nbecause again, it points\nto the fact that the\ninteractions with our significant\nothers shapes our autonomic\narousal, shapes our perception\nof self and thereby shapes our\nperception of other potential\npartners in the outside world,\nor shuts us down to the\npotential of other people\nin the outside world.\nSo when I hear statements such as,\nit's important that you love yourself\nin order to really fall in\nlove with somebody else,\nor it is when one is not\nlooking for a relationship\nthat they're most likely to fall in love\nand form a stable relationship,\nI can filter that through\nthese findings to say that\nit's really the person who\nneeds a lot of self-expansion,\nstimulating statements or\nactions coming from other people\nthat is most prone to seeing\nother potential partners\nout in the world as attractive.\nAnd in this sense,\nwe can return to the\nautonomic nervous system\nas a glass that it can be filled up\nthrough various contexts.\nIt can be filled up through\nour own ability to regulate it.\nIt can be filled up through\nother people's ability\nto enhance our sense of wellbeing.\nAnd in some sense, this points\nto an idea where it is true\nthat the better that we\ncan feel about ourselves\nin the absence of any\nself-expansion type input\nfrom somebody else really does place us\non more stable grounds,\nsuch that when we do receive\nthat praise, or we do receive\nthose acts of kindness,\nor service, or physical\ntouch or whatever they are,\nthat we are able to further\nenhance the way that we feel,\nbut that we don't necessarily\ntether all of our feelings\nof self-worth or self-expansion\nto that one individual.\nSo you might think that if\nperson A can only receive\nthe self-expansion from the\nstatements, from the action\nof the they're involved with, person B,\nthat that will form a very stable bond,\nbut what this study\npoints to is the fact that\nthat's a very unstable bond.\nThat person A is actually very susceptible\nto the attractiveness of others,\nbecause they're so desperately\nattached to this notion\nof self-expansion, even\nif they don't realize it.\nAnd so this really does\npoint to the idea that,\nwell, it is important to link\nour autonomic nervous systems\nto establish desire, love, and attachment\nthat we want to have a stable\ninternal representation\nof ourselves, a stable\nautonomic nervous system\nto some degree in other so\nthat we can be in stable\nromantic partnership\nwith another individual,\nif that what we're really trying to do.\nSo until now, I've been\nweaving together studies\nfrom the field of experimental psychology\nand the fields of neuroscience\nin particular neuroimaging.\nBut if you recall back to the\nvery beginning of the episode,\nwhen I was discussing how\nodors, and how hormones,\nand how even birth control\ncan shape people's ratings\nof attractiveness of others,\nyou'll realize that there's\na deeper layer to all this,\nwhich is that our biology that\nresides below our conscious\nawareness, things like our hormones,\nthings like pheromones\neven are shaping the way\nthat we choose, interpret\nand act with other potential\nromantic partners or the romantic partners\nthat we already have.\nNow, this cannot be\nover-emphasized, right?\nNo matter how much we would like to create\na top-down description,\nmeaning from the cortex\nand our understanding of things\nonto what we find attractive,\nwho we find attractive,\nwhat we enjoy, what we\ndon't enjoy in the pursuit\nin romantic interactions with others,\nthere always seems to be,\nand indeed, there always is\na deeper layer in which\nour subconscious processing\ndrives us to find a particular person\nto be particularly attractive,\nor in which we have\nchemistry with somebody,\nor in which we lack\nchemistry with somebody.\nAnd I would say that one of\nthe more exciting, fascinating,\nand indeed mysterious aspects\nof desire, love and attachment\nare those subconscious processes,\nthose things that we\ncall chemistry, right?\nI mean, people will report,\nfor instance, that somebody's\nsmell is just absolutely\npositively intoxicating for them,\nor that somebody's smell is\nabsolutely repulsive to them\nand they don't know why.\nThat the taste of someone's\nbreath, and I don't mean that\nin any kind of poetic sense,\nI literally mean the taste\nof somebody's breath in some cases\ncan be very exciting to somebody.\nAnd believe it or not, we can\ntaste each other's breath.\nI talked about this in the\nchemical sensing episode\nsome months back, but we\nactually have receptors for taste\nand smell that engage\nin coordinated action,\nsuch that we can't really\nseparate taste and smell\nat some level.\nAnd this is especially true\nwhen it comes to the formation\nof romantic relationships\nand what we call chemistry.\nNow is chemistry absolutely required\nfor forming stable attachments\nfor love and for desire?\nNo, of course, they're not.\nBut in general, these\nare primitive mechanisms\nthat exist in all animals,\nthey exist in special forms in humans,\nbut that they drive us\ntoward behaviors that will,\nas the theory goes, lead\nto love and attachment.\nNot always, as Dr. Fisher pointed\nout that sex and sex drive\nis one way to explore\npotential love relationships,\nand to explore potential attachments,\nwhich, of course, are major investments\nthat extend well beyond one\nnight, or a week, or a vacation,\nor even a year.\nWhen we talk about stable attachments,\nin general, that means\nlong-term attachments in humans.\nNow, there is a biology to\nall of that chemistry stuff.\nAnd the studies of oral\ncontraception and men finding women\nmore attractive at certain\nphases of their menstrual cycle,\nand women finding men more\nattractive at certain phases\nof the women's menstrual cycle\npoint to the incredible power\nof those deeper biological mechanisms.\nIn the \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\nI discuss both science\nand science-based tools.\nAnd so I'd be remiss if\nI didn't actually cover\nsome of the tools that relate\nto those deeper biological mechanisms.\nNow, the hormones,\ntestosterone and estrogen\nare almost always the\nfirst biological chemicals\nand hormones that are mentioned,\nand described, and explored\nwhen thinking about desire,\nand love and attachment, too,\nfor that matter since love and\nattachment stem from desire.\nI did an entire episode about\nthe biology of testosterone\nand estrogen and ways to optimize\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nYou can easily find that\nepisode at hubermanlab.com.\nIt's timestamped, there\nyou can find all sorts\nof information about how\ncertain behaviors or absence\nof behaviors drive up or down\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nI also dispel some myths\nabout sexual behavior\nand things like masturbation\nand how they relate to\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nas well as some myths about\nhow those hormones change\nacross the lifespan.\nI also talk about the role of exercise,\nI talk about supplementation,\nand I also talk a little bit\nabout hormone replacement therapy,\nalthough that will be the\ntopic for a future episode.\nSo if you're interested in\nthe biology of testosterone\nand estrogen, two hormones\nthat absolutely influence\nthings like libido and desire,\nplease check out that episode\nas well as what I'm going to\ntalk about in just a moment here.\nThe simple stereotyped\nversion of the hormones,\ntestosterone and estrogen\nare that testosterone drives\nlibido or increases it aka sex drive,\nand that estrogen somehow\nblunts it or is not involved\nin libido and sex drive.\nAnd that is simply not the case.\nAs I describe in that\ntestosterone and estrogen\noptimization episode and\nas I'll tell you now,\nyes, testosterone and\nsome of its other forms\nlike dihydrotestosterone are\nstrongly related to libido\nand sex drive and the\npursuit and ability to mate.\nHowever, the hormone estrogen\nis also strongly associated\nwith libido and mating behavior.\nSo much so that for people\nthat either chemically\nor for some other reason\nhave very low estrogen,\nlibido can severely suffer.\nSo it's a coordinated dance\nof estrogen and testosterone\nin both males and females that\nleads to libido or sex drive.\nSo I absolutely want to make\nclear that it's not a simple\nrelationship between\ntestosterone and sex drive,\nor estrogen and sex drive.\nBoth are required at appropriate ratios.\nNow, with that said, there are\nthings that can shift libido\nin both men and women in\nthe direction of more desire\nor more desire to mate,\neither to seek mates\nor to mate with existing partners.\nAnd there's a quite solid literature\naround a few of those substances.\nNow, a common misconception\nis that because dopamine\nis involved in motivation and\ndrive that simply increasing\ndopamine through any number of\ndifferent mechanisms or tools\nwill increase libido and sex drive.\nAnd that's simply not the case either.\nIt is true that some level\nof dopamine or increase\nin dopamine is required\nfor increases in libido.\nHowever, because of\ndopamine's relationship\nto the autonomic nervous system,\nand because the autonomic nervous system\nis so intimately\ninvolved, no pun intended,\nin sexual activity in seeking\nan actual mating behavior,\nas I described earlier,\nit's actually the case that\nif people drive their\ndopamine system too high,\nthey will be in states of\narousal that are high enough\nsuch that they seek and\nwant sexual activity,\nbut they can't actually\nengage the parasympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system sufficient\nto become physically aroused.\nThere's a whole description\nof this that awaits us\nin a future episode.\nBut I'll summarize now\nby saying for people\nthat are taking substances just\nsimply to increase dopamine\nin order to increase libido,\nthat can be a potentially\nhazardous route to follow.\nBecause depending on whether\nor not that dopamine level\nis high enough that it puts\nthem into a mode of seeking\nmates or mating, but they\ncan't adjust their autonomic\nnervous system during\nactual mating behavior,\nwhat essentially is I'm\nsaying is it can place people\ninto a chronic pursuit but in\ninability to perform sexually.\nAnd this is true for men and women.\nOkay, so I would just caution\npeople against just thinking,\n\"Oh, a lack of libido is\nsimply a lack of dopamine.\"\nThat is not the case.\nIt could be from lower levels of dopamine,\nbut it could also be for other reasons.\nAnd so these systems,\nthese signaling systems\nand these neurochemicals\nare very intricate.\nAnd just simply ramping up\ndopamine has actually been found,\nfor instance, in amphetamine\nand cocaine users,\nthere's a phenomenon in which\nthey become hyper aroused,\nbut can't perform sexually.\nThis is also true for people\nwho take elevated levels\nof other recreational drugs\nor who take antidepressants\nthat increase the dopamine\nsystem too much, right?\nDosage has to be worked\nout with your physician,\nwith your psychiatrist,\nsuch that mood is enhanced\nand the various aspects\nof a healthy wellbeing,\nmind and body are enhanced,\nbut not so much so that\nthat what we call the arousal\narc is locked with the seesaw\nin the sympathetic drive position\nsuch that sexual arousal\ncan't occur, okay?\nSo this is an important point to make,\nbecause I think that a lot of people\nare under the impression that\nif they just drive up\ntestosterone, increase dopamine,\nand generally get\nthemselves into high states\nof autonomic arousal that that's\ngoing to increase the libido.\nBut that's simply not\nthe way the system works.\nIt's that seesaw and that\nseesawing back and forth\nthat is the arc of arousal\nthat we talked about earlier.\nNow, there are substances, legal\nover-the-counter substances\nthat fall under the\ncategorization of supplements\nthat do indeed increase\nlibido and arousal.\nAnd so I'm going to talk about\nsome of those in the context\nof peer-reviewed literature now.\nI want to be clear, however,\nthat these are by no means required.\nMany people have healthy\nlibidos or have libidos\nthat are healthy for their life\nand what they need and want.\nAnd as always in any discussion\nabout supplementation,\nyou absolutely have to\ncheck with your physician.\nI don't just say that to protect us.\nI say that to protect you.\nYour health and wellbeing is\ndependent on you doing certain\nthings and not doing others,\nand everybody is different.\nNonetheless, there are studies that point\nto specific substances that\nare sold over the counter\nthat at least in the\nUnited States are legal\nand that have been shown to\nbe statistically significant\nin increasing measures of libido.\nThere are many such substances,\nbut three that in particular\nhave good peer-reviewed\nresearch to support them\nare Maca, M-A-C-A, which\nis actually a root.\nTongkat Ali, also\nsometimes called longjack,\nI didn't name them, forgive\nme, and Tribulus, or Tribulus,\nit's sometimes called.\nI'm going to talk about\neach of these in sequence.\nBut on the whole, the studies\non Maca are quite convincing\nthat consumption of two to\nthree grams per day of Maca,\nwhich generally is sold\nas a powder or a capsule,\ntypically consumed early in the day,\nbecause it can be somewhat of a stimulant,\nmeaning it can increase alertness\nand you wouldn't want it\nto interfere with sleep by\ntaking it too late in the day.\nBut in studies that include\nboth men and women of durations\nanywhere from eight to 12 weeks\nof athletes and non-athletes,\nand different variations of Maca,\nturns out there's black\nMaca, red Maca, yellow Maca.\nThere are a bunch of\ndifferent forms of Maca.\nBut that they can increase\nsubjective reports\nof sexual desire, independent\nof hormone systems.\nMeaning, it does not seem at\nleast based on the existing\nliterature that Maca\nincreases testosterone\nor changes estrogen, at\nleast not on the time scales\nthat these studies were done,\nor with the measures that were\nperformed in these studies.\nBut that Maca, again,\nconsumed in doses of anywhere\nfrom two to three grams per day,\nhas been shown to\nsignificantly increase libido.\nAnd in fact, those dosages of\nMaca have been shown to offset\nso-called SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.\nSo there are various routes\nto sexual dysfunction.\nThe SSRIs are selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors.\nThey go by name brands\nlike Prozac and Zoloft,\nand there are many others now\non generic forms and so forth.\nThose don't always, I should point out,\nlead to sexual dysfunction.\nThere's a dose dependence.\nSome people do quite well on\nSSRIs and don't have any issues\nwith sexual function.\nOther people suffer quite a\nlot from sexual dysfunction\nwhile taking SSRIs, highly variable.\nYou need to work with a physician,\na qualified psychiatrist.\nBut nonetheless, everything\nI've been saying about Maca\nthus far has also been\nexplored in the context of SSRI\ninduced sexual dysfunction.\nThe paper that I'm referring to here is\n\"A Double‐Blind, Randomized,\nPilot Dose‐Finding Study\nof Maca Root...\"\nIt goes by the name L. meyenii.\nThese always have fancy names.\nAnd the Latin names in biology\nare always more complicated,\nbut it's Maca root.\n\"for the Management of\nSSRI‐Induced Sexual Dysfunction.\"\nFirst author is Dording, D-O-R-D-I-N-G.\nThis was a study done at Mass General,\nwhich is one of the satellite\nlocations around Harvard Med.\nIt's associated with Harvard Med,\nthat found significant\nimprovements in libido\nwhen people were taking a pretty low dose.\nIt was actually in this\ncase, just 1.5 grams per day,\nup to a high dose, three\ngrams per day of Maca.\nAnd they were doing this\nin 20 remitted depressed outpatients.\nSo these are people that had depression,\ntheir depression was\nsuccessfully treated with SSRIs,\nbut they were suffering from\nsome of these SSRI related\nsexual effects and Maca seemed to offset\nsome of those effects\nsignificantly in this population.\nThe other studies exploring\nthe lack of effect on serum\ntestosterone in adult healthy\nmen was a 12-week study,\nagain, consuming anywhere\nfrom 1.5 to three milligrams,\nmeaning one, excuse me, 1500 milligrams\nto 3000 milligrams or placebo.\nSo again, this is 1.5 up to\nthree grams of Maca or placebo,\nand they rated sexual desire,\ndepression, and other measures\nsuch as testosterone in the blood.\nAgain, no change in\ntestosterone or estrogen\nestradiol levels in men treated with Maca\nand those treated with placebo.\nBut nonetheless, there was a\nsignificant and positive effect\non libido with this dosage of 1.5\nto three grams per day of Maca.\nAnd there are several other\nstudies that also show this.\nAgain, in people that taking\nSSRIs and people that are not\ntaking SSRIs, in chronically\nover-trained athletes,\nthis was also found to be the case.\nSo seems like across the board,\nMaca is a fairly useful supplement\nfor those that are seeking\nto increase their libido.\nAnd there are fewer\nstudies involving women,\nbut there are a few such studies\nthat also point to the same\ngeneral positive effect on\nlibido in women taking Maca\nat equivalent doses to\nthose I just described.\nI think it's noteworthy\nthat Maca supplementation\ndoes not seem to adjust\ntestosterone or estrogen levels\nto any significant degree,\nbut it does change libido.\nI think that points to the\nfact that there are multiple\nsystems in the brain and\nbody that influence libido,\nnot just testosterone and estrogen.\nAnd indeed we know that to be the case.\nThings like PEA, which is a\nsubstance found in chocolate\nand is a substance that\nsome people supplement,\nis known, for instance,\nto increase sexual desire,\nbut also the perception\nof sexual experiences\nas more stimulating for instance.\nSo there are a lot of pathways\nin the brain, in particular,\nin the hypothalamus, this\nancient area of our brain,\nthat harbors neurons and\nhormone secreting cells,\nincluding neurons that\ncan shape our perceptions\nof even just our tactile experience\nof others and their attractiveness.\nAnd indeed can shift levels\nof desire, independent\nof changing levels of\ncirculating hormones.\nAnother substance that has\nbeen shown to increase libido\nacross a range of human populations\nis so-called Tongkat Ali.\nI've talked a little bit about this before\non the \"Huberman Lab Podcast\"\nin reference to testosterone.\nAnd I've talked about it\nextensively as a guest\non other podcasts.\nTongkat Ali goes by a\nnumber of different names.\nOne of them is exceedingly\ndifficult for me to pronounce.\nIt's Eurycoma longifolia,\nalso called longjack.\nBut Tongkat Ali is the typical name.\nThis is an herb, there's\na Malaysian version\nand an Indonesian version.\nMy understanding is that\nthe Indonesian variety\nof Tongkat Ali is the\none that is most potent\nfor its effects on libido.\nPreviously, I've talked about Tongkat Ali\ntaken in 400 milligram per day capsules\nas a means to increase the amount of free,\nmeaning unbound testosterone.\nSo testosterone has a both\nbound form and an unbound form.\nVery briefly, the bound\nform is bound to albumin\nin the blood or to so-called\nsex hormone binding globulin.\nWhen it's bound, it can't\nbe biologically active\nat many cells.\nIt is important that some\nof it be bound in order\nto get a time release\nand proper distribution\nof testosterone through the body,\nbut is the unbound free\ntestosterone that can really\nhave its most potent effects.\nAnd there's some evidence\nthat Tongkat Ali can increase\nthe amount of unbound\nso-called free testosterone\nby lowering sex hormone binding globulin,\nalthough it is almost certain\nthat it has other routes\nof mechanism as well.\nNonetheless, there are\nsome reports of Tongkat Ali\nincreasing libido.\nOne particular article,\nlast author, or I should say\nlast name of first author,\nexcuse me, Ismail, I-S-M-A-I-L.\nThis was published in\nEvidence-Based Complementary\nand Alternative Medicine, it's from 2012.\nReports a significant increase in libido\nand sexual function.\nThere are other studies,\nnot a lot of them,\nnot as many robust, controlled,\nquality peer-reviewed\nstudies as there are from Maca.\nNonetheless, a number of people,\nmen and women that I know\ndo take Tongkat Ali and it\nseems to work well for them.\nThe question always comes up around\ndiscussion of supplements.\nDo you need to cycle these things?\nThe only way to determine that is really\nto do your blood work,\nmonitor liver enzymes,\nmonitor hormone levels and so forth.\nSo I simply can't say\nwhether or not you need to,\nor you don't need to cycle them.\nTypically Tongkat Ali\nand Maca are not cycled\nin any regular kind of\nway that I'm aware of.\nBut again, you really need\nto check with your doctor\nif you're going to initiate\ntaking any of these things.\nAnd you certainly should\ndo your best to monitor\nyour blood work as well as\nsubjective measures in evaluating\nwhether or not they're working for you,\nsafe for you and so forth.\nThe third and final substance/supplement\nthat I want to touch on\nas it relates to libido\nis called Tribulus Terrestris.\nSo that's T-R-I-B-U-L-U-S,\nterrestris, T-E-R-R-E-S-T-R-I-S.\nThis is a commonly sold\nover-the-counter supplement\nfor increasing testosterone,\nfor fitness purposes and so on.\nWhether or not it actually does that\nto a meaningful degree, isn't clear.\nBut I'm aware of four\npeer-reviewed studies\nthat were focused on\nboth males and females\nranging anywhere from 18 years old\nall the way up to 65 plus.\nThey say 65 plus.\nI guess it could be 70, it could be 80.\nI don't know.\nBut a fairly broad age range\nwhere people took anywhere\nfrom 750 milligrams per day\ndivided into three equal doses.\nSo 750 total per day divided\ninto three equal doses\nof Tribulus or placebo for 120 days.\nThis particular study\nwas focused on females.\nAnd according to the female\nsexual function index\nquestionnaire, no significant difference\nbetween any of the groups,\nhowever free and bio-available\ntestosterone increased in the group taking\nTribulus Terrestris, total testosterone\ndid not reach statistical significance.\nSo this is the inverse\nof what we see with Maca,\nwhere there do seem to be\nincreases in testosterone,\nwhich would predict that there\nwould be increase in libido.\nIn this case, this was\npostmenopausal women,\nthere was no increase in libido.\nThere was an increase in testosterone.\nI mentioned it only because\nthere might be instances\nin which people want to\nincrease their testosterone.\nIt does seem that Tribulus,\nat least in that population\nis capable of doing that.\nNow there's a separate\nstudy that was done,\na double-blind study lasting\nanywhere from one to six months\nthat had a clear and\nsignificant increase in libido.\nNow this was taking six grams.\nSo that's 6,000 milligrams\nof Tribulus root for 60 days.\nAnd it did seem to\nincrease various aspects\nof sexual function.\nAnd there was what appeared\nto be a substantial 16.3%\nincrease in testosterone,\nbut in this particular study\nbecause of the variability\nacross individuals\nthat did not actually arrive\nat statistical significance.\nNow, there were a number of\nother studies that explored\nthe role of Tribulus, in\nparticular, in females.\nAnd one of those studies was a study\nthat was actually quite short,\nit was two to four weeks.\nIt involved 67 subjects.\nThese were subjects that had\nexperienced a loss of libido\nand took Tribulus divided\ninto two equal doses,\ncompared that to placebo.\nAnd they did see a significant\nimprovement in these measures\nof sexual desire and function\non this female sexual function index.\nSo there is some evidence\nthat Tribulus can be effective\nin increasing testosterone\nin certain populations,\nin increasing sexual desire and function\nin certain populations\nin particular in females.\nI think more studies are certainly needed.\nBut these three substances/supplements,\nMaca, Tongkat Ali, in particular,\nIndonesian Tongkat Ali,\nand Tribulus can indeed create significant\nincreases in sexual desire.\nAnd in some cases by\nadjusting the testosterone\nand estrogen system, in\nsome cases not by adjusting\nthe testosterone and estrogen system.\nAgain, pointing to the\ncomplexity of neurochemicals\nand features that adjust\nthings like libido aka desire.\nSo we covered a lot of\nmaterial today related\nto desire, love, and attachment.\nAnd yet I acknowledge\nthat it is not exhaustive\nof the vast landscape that\nis the psychology and biology\nof desire, love and attachment.\nNonetheless, I hope that\nyou found the
