    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're talking all about goals\nand the science of goal setting\nand achieving your goals.\nThere's a tremendous amount of information\non the internet and in books and so forth,\nabout how to set goals\nand assess your progress towards goals\nand update your goals and so forth.\nIn fact, there are so\nmany programs out there,\nthat includes so many different acronyms\nthat it can be a little bit overwhelming.\nToday's conversation about goals,\nis going to be quite a bit different.\nIndeed, we are going to\ntalk about setting goals.\nWe are also going to talk\nabout how to assess progress\ntowards goals.\nAnd we are going to talk\nabout goal execution.\nHowever, we're going to do all of this\nin the context of neuroscience,\nbecause it turns out that there\nare not hundreds or dozens\nor even several neural\ncircuits in your brain,\nthat control goal setting and\nmovement toward your goals.\nThere is one\nand while it includes many\ndifferent brain areas,\nthat one circuit is the same circuit,\nthat's responsible for pursuing all goals.\nAnd it relates to some very\nbasic neurochemical mechanisms\nthat are understood.\nSo while there's a wealth\nof information out there\nabout goals and goal setting\nand goal achievement and so forth,\nthere's comparatively little information\nthat's been available to the public\nabout the neuroscience of goal\nsetting and goal achievement.\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to focus on today.\nI promise that we're going\nto get into the neuroscience,\nwe're going to touch on a\nlittle bit of the psychology\nand how the neuroscience\nrelates to what's known\nin the psychology literature.\nAnd we are going to\nestablish several, in fact,\nfour specific protocols that\nyou can use for goal setting,\ngoal assessment and goal\nexecution in an ongoing basis,\nregardless of what your\npersonal goals happen to be.\nBefore we dive into our\nconversation about goals\nand goal setting and goal achievement,\nI'd like to highlight some\nrecent scientific findings,\nthat I think are going to be interesting\nand actionable for many of you out there.\nIn earlier podcasts, we\ntalked about neuro-plasticity,\nwhich is the brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nIn fact, neuroplasticity\nunderlies all forms of learning,\nwhether or not it's language\nlearning or learning music\nor math or a physical skill,\nall forms of learning\ninvolve the reorganization\nof connections in the nervous system,\nthe brain and spinal cord and body.\nOne of the key principles\nof neuroplasticity,\nis this notion of making\nerrors as a good thing\ntoward neuroplasticity.\nIt is a little bit counterintuitive,\nbut what the scientific\nliterature tells us,\nis that whenever we're trying\nto learn something new,\nif we make an error, we\nknow it feels frustrating,\nbut that state of frustration,\nactually queues up particular\nbrain areas to be more alert,\nso that on subsequent\nattempts to learn that thing,\nwe have a heightened level of focus\nand a higher probability\nof learning the new skill,\nregardless of what that skill is.\nAnd I've talked about this\nbefore in various episodes,\nas encouraging people to\nembrace errors or pursue errors,\nnot as their own end goal,\nbut errors as an entry point\nfor making the brain more plastic.\nAnd if you think about\nit really makes sense,\nwhy would the brain change at all,\nif it's performing everything perfectly?\nWhen you make errors, well\nin the immediate seconds\nand minutes after those errors,\nyou are in a better position to learn.\nA common question I get, however,\nis what should be the rate\nof errors?\nWhich is really just a way of saying,\nhow hard should the given task be\nthat you're trying to learn or perform?\nAnd it turns out there's an answer.\nThere's a recent paper that was published\nin a great journal,\n\"Nature Communications\".\nThis is a paper, our last\nauthor, Jonathan Cohen,\nand the paper is entitled,\n\"The Eighty Five Percent\nRule for optimal learning\".\nThis paper, we will\nmake available by a link\nin the show note captions,\nbut basically what this paper shows,\nis that when trying to\nlearn something new,\nyou want to make the difficulty\nof what you're trying to learn, such that,\nyou are getting things\nright about 85% of the time.\nThat you're making errors\nabout 15% of the time.\nAnd the reason I like this paper,\nis it really points\nspecifically to some protocols\nthat we can implement\nbecause people always say, okay,\nyou want to set a high goal.\nYou want to try and achieve\nsomething that's really lofty,\nbut you don't want to\nmake the goal so lofty\nthat you don't make any progress at all.\nOther people say, you really want to start\nwith really small goals\nand make things very, very incremental.\nOnly set out to do things that\nyou know you can accomplish\nand that will feed back on\nyour self-esteem and all these\npositive feedback loops.\nAnd then, you know, layer\nby layer, layer by layer,\nyou'll eventually get\nwhere you want to go.\nWell, it turns out that neither is true\nyou need to set the level of difficulty,\nsuch that you're making\nerrors about 15% of the time.\nAnd I want to emphasize\nabout 15% of the time,\nbecause there's no way to\nfigure protocols for sport\nor language or math or anything else,\nwhere you're going to\nhave exactly 15% errors.\nSo, anyway, this paper, the\n85% rule for optimal learning,\nagain, we will supply the link,\nbut it really points to the idea\nof making things pretty hard,\nbut not so hard that you're\nfailing every attempt\nor even half of the attempts.\nFailing about 15% of the time\nseems optimal for learning.\nHopefully that information\nwill be useful to any of you\nthat are trying to learn something.\nHopefully it will also\nbe useful to those of you\nthat are teaching kids or other adults.\nIf you're teaching,\nkeep in mind that you want\nto keep the students reaching\nfor higher and higher\nlevels of proficiency\nin whatever that is that you're teaching.\nAnd that 15% of the time\nthey should be failing,\nif it gets to 20%, that's probably okay.\nIf they start failing about half the time,\nthen probably what they're\ntrying to learn is too difficult\nfor them at that point.\nNow, of course, this is going\nto be controlled by all sorts\nof external factors,\nlike whether or not they\nslept well the night before,\nwhether or not you slept\nwell the night before\nand you're being clear\nin your instructions\nto them, et cetera.\nBut I think the 15%\nrule as we may call it,\nis a good metric to aim for\nand it can serve both\nstudents and teachers.\nIn other words, it can\nserve both those teaching\nand those that are learning.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast,\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort,\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT,\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nmixed with everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means lots of salt,\nsome other electrolytes and no sugar.\nAs I've mentioned before on this podcast\nand in various interviews,\nI'm a big fan of salt.\nI sort of discovered this a few years ago,\nwhen \"Science Magazine\",\none of the pre-eminent\nmagazines out there,\nthat publishes research on science,\nbut also news articles about science,\ntalked about the myth of salt research.\nIt turns out, that contrary\nto what I had believed,\nwhich was that salt is\ngoing to cause hypertension\nor that salt is really bad for us.\nThere's an innate need\nfor salt in our system\nand indeed, if you dive into\nthe textbooks on salt balance,\nwe have entire biological\nsystems of our kidneys\nand fluid management, et cetera,\nthat are involved in making\nsure that we get enough salt.\nIn fact, neurons, nerve cells, function\nbecause salt, sodium actually\nenters those cells quickly\nand that's what causes them\nto fire action potentials.\nThe common syllable or a\nlanguage of neurons, if you will,\nwhen we are low in sodium,\nour neurons don't work as well.\nAnd a few years later,\nI had the experience of\nfeeling kind of shaky\nand I thought I had blood sugar issues.\nI went and got my blood sugar\nchecked and it was fine.\nAnd a physician made the recommendation,\nthat I actually up my salt intake.\nMy intake wasn't particularly\nlow, I didn't think,\nbut I quickly found,\nwas that if I consumed enough salt,\nusually I would do this in the form\nof putting a little pinch\nof salt into some water,\nadding a little lemon juice\nor something like that,\nor salting my food a little bit more.\nThat I lost any kind of\nshakiness in my hands,\nthat my mental functioning was better,\nmy sports performance\nwas better, et cetera.\nSo it was really interesting\nto see that shift simply\nby increasing my salt intake,\nsomething that's really counterintuitive,\nto a lot of what's out there.\nSalt isn't just important\nfor the function of neurons,\nit's important for blood volume\nand working alongside the\nother electrolytes, magnesium\nand potassium,\nit ensures that cells in\nour body function properly.\nAnd I think we're starting\nto see a shift out there now,\nin the perception of what salt\nand the other electrolytes do.\nAnd really seeing magnesium,\nwhich is one of the\nelectrolytes, potassium\nand especially salt, as not\nnecessarily something to avoid,\nbut in fact something to embrace,\nprovided that they're used properly.\nLMNT is formulated to help anyone,\nreach their electrolyte needs\nand is particularly well-suited\nto people following a keto,\nlow carb or paleo diet.\nFor people following a low carb diet\nor doing intermittent fasting,\nwhat many people don't know,\nis that carbohydrate holds water.\nIt actually brings water into the system\nand you don't want your\nsystem to be low on water,\nthat's one form of dehydration..\nSalt holds water as well,\nmeaning it keeps the water in your system,\nwhich is beneficial for\nbrain and body function.\nLMNT contains a science-backed\nelectrolyte ratio\nof 1000 milligrams,\nthat's one gram of sodium,\n200 milligrams of potassium\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nAnd they use the very best\nforms of salt, potassium,\nand magnesium that are out there.\nSo the way I use LMNT, is I\nusually will mix up one packet\ninto about 16 to 30 ounces\nof water in the morning\nand drink that first thing\nin the morning when I wake up\nor around breakfast time,\ndoesn't really matter.\nI kind of sip on it through the morning\nor if I'm really thirsty,\nI'll drink it all at once.\nAnd then I always make sure\nto drink a volume of water\nwith an LMNT packet in it,\nsomewhere around my exercise.\nSometimes it's during the exercise,\nif I'm running, I'll\nwait until afterwards.\nI'll hydrate with it before and after,\nif it's a really hot day.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to\ndrinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T.com/huberman,\nto claim a free element sample pack.\nYou only cover the cost of shipping,\notherwise it's completely free.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free sample pack.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an\nall-in-one vitamin mineral,\nprobiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens,\nis that it covers all of\nmy foundational vitamin,\nmineral, probiotic needs.\nWe of course need vitamins.\nWe of course need minerals\nand we do need a healthy gut microbiome\nand probiotics, support\na healthy gut microbiome.\nThere is now a wealth of quality\nscientific published data,\nshowing that the microbiota,\nmeaning the little microbes\nthat live in our gut,\nare good for us.\nAnd our gut when it functions properly,\ncommunicates with our brain\nand our brain communicates with our gut\nthrough the so-called, gut-brain axis.\nAnd that gut-brain axis,\nis vital for things like immune system,\nendocrine system, meaning hormones\nand for mood and overall brain function.\nWith Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins,\nmy minerals and the probiotics I need,\nto support a healthy gut\nmicrobiome and gut-brain axis\nwithout having to worry\nabout taking a bunch\nof other things.\nIn fact, when people ask me,\nwhat's the one supplement I should take,\nthat's going to make me feel better?\nI always say Athletic Greens\nbecause indeed it makes me feel better\nand it happens to taste terrific.\nI drink it twice a day, typically,\nI'll have one in the morning,\nI mix it with water and a little\nbit of lemon or lime juice.\nAnd I'll typically have\nit again in the afternoon\nor late afternoon,\nagain, mixed with water,\nsome lemon or lime juice.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens,\nwhile you're in the car or\ntraveling by plane, et cetera.\nPlus, they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 + K2.\nMany of us are deficient in vitamin D3\nand even for those of us\nthat are getting sufficient sunshine,\nmany of us still need to\nsupplement with vitamin D3.\nVitamin D3 is involved in\nmetabolism, immune system,\nbrain function, hormones, et cetera.\nIt has so many important functions,\nand K2 has been shown to be important\nfor a variety of things,\nnot the least, which is\ncardiovascular health.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 + K2.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nto claim this special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nthat have the absolute highest quality.\nI spent a lifetime working on the science\nof the visual system\nand I can tell you that your\nvisual system everywhere\nfrom your eyes to your brain,\nincludes a ton of different mechanisms,\nso that as you move through\ndifferent environments,\nyou can see things clearly.\nAnd even if it's bright\nout or there are shadows\nor it's really dim outside,\nor it's getting dark,\nthat your visual system\ncan try and manage,\nto resolve what's out there in the world,\nso you can see things clearly.\nMany people need corrective\nlenses, they need eyeglasses.\nOther people, they need\nsunglasses as well,\nor just simply need sunglasses\nbecause if it's too bright,\nit's very hard to see things.\nOne problem with a lot of eyeglasses\nand sunglasses out there, however,\nis they don't take into account,\nthe nuanced biology, the visual system.\nYou may have experienced this.\nHave you ever put on a pair of sunglasses\nthat aren't so great?\nYou move from a really bright\narea into a dimly lit area\nand you have to take the eyeglasses off,\nyour eyes just don't seem to adjust.\nWith ROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses,\neverything they've done to\ndesign those glasses and lenses,\nis with the science of\nthe visual system in mind.\nSo you can move seamlessly from\none environment to the next\nand you always see things\nwith crystal clarity.\nTheir sunglasses and\neyeglasses are really terrific\nbecause they can be used for anything.\nThey have a terrific aesthetic,\nso you can wear them,\nto work to dinner, et\ncetera, they look great.\nAnd, they're also designed\nfor athletic performance,\nyou can use them while\nrunning or while cycling,\nif you get sweaty, they\nwon't slip off your face.\nThey're extremely lightweight,\nin fact, I often forget that\nthey're even on my face.\nI wear readers at night\nand sometimes when I drive\nand I wear sunglasses when\nit's really bright outside\nand I need sunglasses.\nIf you want to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\nyou can go to roka.com\nThat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code Huberman,\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA,\nR-O-K-A.com and enter the\ncode Huberman at checkout.\nLet's talk about the\nscience and in particular,\nthe biology and neuroscience\nof setting and achieving goals.\nSetting and achieving goals,\nis not a uniquely human endeavor.\nOther animals set and\nattempt to achieve goals,\na honeybee attempts to collect honey\nand bring it back to the hive.\nA herbivore will go out\nand forage for plants\nand will also have a need to reproduce\nat some point in its life.\nSo, will need to find a mate\nand maybe even raise the young,\ndepending on what species that is.\nPredators will have to hunt\nand kill and eat their food\nand they have to avoid getting\ninjured in that process.\nThey also have to raise young, et cetera.\nSo humans are among the other animals,\nor we could say the animals are among us\nin the need to set goals\nand to make efforts to\nachieve those goals.\nNow, why do I emphasize\nthis commonality of process?\nThe reason I emphasize this\ncommonality of process,\nis that it turns out that\nthere is one basic system\nby which all animals, including humans,\nset and attempt to achieve goals.\nNow humans are unique in our\nability to orient our mind\ntoward immediate goals,\nmoderately termed goals,\nmeaning things that might\nexist on the scale of a week\nor a month or even a year\nand very long-term goals,\nlike a lifetime goal\nor a goal that lasts a decade,\nor it takes a decade to achieve.\nThat's what makes us unique.\nAnd of course we don't\nhave access to the mindset\nor the thinking or the\nemotions of other animals,\nbut what we do know is that,\ncommon neural circuits,\nmeaning brain areas,\nthat are present in animal\nspecies and in humans,\nare responsible for orienting\nour thinking and our action\ntoward particular goals.\nAnother thing that's really\nunique about the human brain,\nis that we are able to have\nmultiple goals interacting\nat once.\nSo, for instance, we probably\nall have fitness goals,\ngoals in relationships of\ndifferent kinds, friendships,\nand romantic partnerships\nas well as maybe scholastic goals.\nMaybe you're in school\nor you're pursuing some\nkind of learning outside\nof the school environment\nor indoor, you have business\ngoals or financial goals,\nwe are able to have\nmultiple goals at once.\nAnd other animals do this,\nbut humans are unique in the ability\nto juggle a lot of goals.\nAnd actually one of the major\nchallenges in pursuing goals,\nis that goal pursuit often interacts,\nmeaning if you can spend 100%\nof your time chasing one particular goal,\nthat might be very\neffective for that goal,\nbut then we tend to fall back\non some of our other goals.\nYou can imagine how this plays out.\nIf you're working very, very hard,\nyou're solely focused on business often,\nyour health will suffer.\nIf you're solely focused\non your health often,\nother things will suffer.\nAnd so we have to juggle\nboth our goal setting\nand our goal pursuits.\nAnd so today, we're going\nto talk about a number\nof different ways,\nto work with what could\nvery well be called,\nthese interleaving goals,\nby focusing on a common practice\nor common set of mechanisms\nthat are present in all\naspects of goal seeking.\nWhat is that process?\nWell, it turns out, it's a neural circuit.\nA neural circuit, is simply\na collection of brain areas,\nthat when active in a\nparticular sequence give rise\nto a particular behavior or perception.\nSo for instance, when you feel happy,\nit's not because you have a brain area,\nthat's the happy brain area,\nthat is electrically active.\nRather, it's going to\ninvolve numerous brain areas,\nbeing active in concert\nand to different degrees.\nIn the same way, that the\nkeys on a piano, together,\nplayed in the appropriate sequence,\nrepresent a particular song.\nYou would never say that one key\non the piano represents that song,\nbut that key is necessary.\nSimilarly, in the brain,\nwe can say that a brain\narea might be necessary,\nbut not sufficient to give\nus a particular experience\nor generate a particular behavior.\nSo when we think about goal\nseeking and the pursuit of goals\nof any kind in the brain,\nit doesn't matter what the goal is.\nIt involves a common\nset of neural circuits\nand the neural circuit\nthat I'd like to orient us\ntoward today.\nAnd we will return to it a few times,\ninvolves learning a couple of names,\nbut you don't have to worry so\nmuch about memorizing these.\nJust more important is\nto understand the logic\nof how it's put together\nand I will explain that\nand make it very clear.\nIf you want to learn\nthe names, that's great.\nOne of the brain areas is\nthe so-called, amygdala.\nThe amygdala is most often\nassociated with fear,\nso you might say, wow,\nhow is that involved in\ngoal directed behavior?\nWell, a lot of our goal directed behavior,\nis to avoid punishments,\nincluding things like\nembarrassment or financial ruin\nor things of that sort.\nAnd so the amygdala and some\nsense of anxiety or fear,\nis actually built in to the circuits\nthat generate goal seeking\nand our motivation to pursuit goals.\nThe other areas are the\nso-called, ventral striatum.\nThe striatum is part of what's\ncalled, the basal ganglia.\nThe basal ganglia, is a neural circuit,\nthat can very simply be\ndescribed as a neural circuit\nthat helps us generate go,\nmeaning the initiation of action\nand no-go, the prevention\nof action type scenarios.\nLet me make that even simpler.\nThe ventral striatum is\npart of this thing called,\nthe basal ganglia.\nThe basal ganglia has sort\nof two circuits within it.\nOne circuit is involved in\ngetting us to do things,\nlike I'm going to get up tomorrow\nand I'm going to run five miles\nfirst thing in the morning.\nI don't know if I'm\nactually going to do that,\nbut I'm just using that as an example.\nAnother circuit within the basal ganglia,\nis a no-go circuit, it's\nthe one that says, no,\nI'm not going to go for the second cookie\nor the third cookie.\nI'm not going to eat that.\nAnd then the go circuit would\nbe the one that's responsible\nfor instead eating something else.\nOkay, so we have go and no-go circuits\nwithin the basal ganglia.\nSo we've got amygdala,\nso what you think of as\nkind of fear and anxiety\nand avoidance.\nWe've got, the basal ganglia,\nwhich are for initiating\naction and preventing action.\nAnd then there is the so-called, cortex.\nThe cortex is the outer\nshell of the brain,\nand there are two sub\nregions of the cortex,\nthat are involved in\ngoal-directed behavior.\nOne is the lateral prefrontal cortex,\nprefrontal cortex is involved in,\nso-called, executive function,\nthings like planning.\nThinking about things\nunder different timescales,\nso not just what we want\nin the immediate term,\nbut what we might want\ntomorrow or the next day\nand how our actions currently\nare going to relate,\nto the future.\nAnd the so-called, orbitofrontal cortex,\norbitofrontal cortex has a\nlarge number of functions,\nbut one of the key functions\nof the orbitofrontal cortex,\nit's involved in meshing some emotionality\nwith our current state of progress\nand comparing that emotionality\nto where it might be,\nwhen we are closer to a goal.\nSo, there are basically four areas,\none involved in anxiety,\none involved in emotion,\none involved in planning\nand another involved in\nthis go, no-go action.\nSo that's a bunch of detail,\nbut if I wanted to make it\nreally simple for everyone,\nI would say there are four areas.\nOne is an area associated\nwith anxiety and fear,\nit's the amygdala.\nThe second is involved\nin action and inaction,\nremember go, and no-go, so\nthat's the basal ganglia.\nThe other one is involved\nin planning and thinking\nacross different timescales,\nso that's lateral prefrontal cortex.\nAnd then the fourth one, is\ninvolved in emotionality,\nwhere we sit emotionally present,\ncompared to where we think\nwe will be emotionally,\nwhen we reach some particular goal\nand that's the orbitofrontal cortex.\nAgain, you don't need\nto know all those names.\nYou don't need to know all the details,\njust understand that those\ndifferent elements are involved\nin the decision-making\nprocesses that lead us\ntoward particular goals\nand have us update our\ngoal seeking, et cetera.\nOne key thing is it doesn't\nmatter what the goal is,\nthe same circuits are involved.\nSo whether or not you're\ntrying to build a company,\nthat's a billion dollar company\nthat's going to go public,\nor you're thinking about\nplanning a craft day at home\nwith the kids or for yourself,\nor you're thinking about\nwhat movie to go see.\nGoals, goal seeking and\nassessing progress towards goals,\nall involve the exact\nsame neural circuits.\nIt's really remarkable.\nIt's also very convenient\nfor our discussion today.\nWhat's going on in these circuits,\ncan basically be boiled down\nto two particular things.\nThe first is, value information,\ntrying to understand whether or not,\nsomething is really worth pursuing or not.\nSo, placing a value on a particular goal.\nThe other component of\nthis neural circuit,\nis associated with action,\nwhich actions to take and\nwhich actions not to take,\ngiven the value of a particular goal\nin a given moments time.\nI want to say that again.\nThe other component of the\ncircuit is involved in action,\nwhether or not you should\nact or should not act,\nbased on your assessment\nof the value of a goal\nat a particular moment in time.\nAnd you're going to hear\nme say over and over again,\nin this episode,\nthe value information\nabout a goal is so key.\nHere's why, there is basically\none neuro-transmitter\nor rather neuromodulator system,\nthat governs our goal\nsetting, goal assessment\nand goal pursuit.\nAnd that is the neuromodulator dopamine.\nDopamine is the common currency\nby which we assess our progress\ntoward particular things\nof particular value.\nIn fact, dopamine, is the\nway that we assess value\nof our pursuits.\nAnd so, as we take a moment\nand we shift our attention,\nto the psychology of goal setting.\nThe things that you've probably\nheard a bit more about,\nabout what sorts of goals\nare good and how to set goals\nand how to categorize goals.\nI want you to think about how dopamine,\ncould possibly be involved\nin these different processes.\nAnd the reason I want you to do this,\nis that all of the\npsychology of goal setting\nand goal pursuit, is wonderful\nbecause it places things\ninto different categories.\nIt allows us to parse our thinking\nand organize our thinking.\nBut what's not often seen,\nin fact, I'm not aware of\nany literature out there,\nscientific or literature\nin the popular press\nor in popular books,\nis an understanding of how\nthe underlying neurobiology,\ncan be layered on top of the\npsychology of goal setting,\nto allow us to set and pursue\nour goals more effectively.\nAnd that's what we're going to do today.\nWe are eventually going to arrive\nat a set of four practices,\nthat when performed on a regular basis,\nwill allow you to assess,\nwhat is the value of this\nnext particular action step?\nHow worthwhile is it, to do\nbehavior A versus behavior B\nin order to achieve a particular goal?\nIf any of this is vague now,\nI'm going to make it\nall very clear for you.\nYou're going to come away\nwith some very specific lists\nof takeaways that you can put\ndown on paper, if you like.\nAnd that you can use to\nset goals, assess goals,\nand execute goals more effectively,\nusing the neuroscience of\nthe circuits I just described\nand an understanding of the\nneuromodulator dopamine.\nLet's take a look at the\npsychology of goal setting\nand goal pursuit.\nThis is an enormous literature,\nmeaning there are tens of thousands,\nif not hundreds of thousands\nof scientific papers\nabout the topic of goal\nsetting and goal pursuit.\nThere's also a lot of\ninformation on the internet\nabout goal pursuit.\nAnd in looking over this information,\none comes to appreciate pretty quickly,\nthat acronyms are a big thing.\nAcronyms, seem to dominate\nthe area of goal setting,\nespecially as it relates to\nthings in the business sector,\nbut also in the relationship sector.\nNow, acronyms are wonderful,\nthey allow us to organize\nour thinking into less\nand conceptually they can be very useful.\nBut as I moved through this literature,\nI started to see some redundant themes.\nAnd so what I've attempted to do,\nis distill out the redundant themes,\nthat regardless of the person teaching\nor the scientific laboratory\nthat happened to come up\nwith these acronyms,\nthat they boil down to\nsome common features.\nSo let's talk about that literature\nand I think we'll come\naway with an understanding\nof some basic elements that\nare common to all goals.\nNow, the modern science or the\nmodern psychological science\nof trying to understand\ngoal setting and pursuit,\nactually dates back to the 1930s.\nAnd we have to be sure that\nmembers of our species,\nwere focused on goal\nsetting and goal pursuit,\nlong before the scientific\nliterature emerged.\nIt just stands to reason that,\nsince the human brain\nhasn't evolved that much,\nwe don't think, in the last 10,000 years,\nthat people would be\nthinking about these things.\nThey just didn't get\nthem down into papers,\nthat we could evaluate\non PubMed and so forth,\nbut now we can,\nso we can look at those papers.\nAnd what you find is\nthat acronyms are abound\nin the psychology literature\nabout goal setting and goal pursuit.\nSo for instance, you'll\nhear about the work\nof Larkin Small, for instance,\nthese are the last names\nof various researchers.\nThe so-called, ABC method, that\na goal should be achievable,\nit should be believable,\nand that the person be committed.\nIt's sort of obvious once you\nhear about the ABC method.\nThen people came along\nand expanded on that,\nthey talked about the\nso-called, SMART method.\nSMART being another acronym,\nthat it be specific,\nthat the goal be measurable,\nthat the goal be attainable,\nthat the goal be realistic\nand that it be time-bound,\nmeaning that you set up\ncertain period of time\nin which a given goal should be performed.\nAnd then people come\nalong and modify these,\nthis is the way that\npsychology research is done.\nI'm not laughing at it.\nI'm just chuckling because,\nit seems like the acronyms get\nlonger and longer and longer.\nThey developed the, SMARTER approach,\nadding an ER to the acronym,\nSMART, S-M-A-R-T-E-R.\nThey added ethical and\nrewarding, which fortunately,\nare good things I believe,\nethical and rewarding.\nWhat does all this mean?\nWell, what it means is that\nany kind of goal pursuit,\nany kind of goal setting,\nreally has to involve a\nnumber of different states\nand neural circuits in the brain and body,\nat least that's how I\nview this literature.\nWhy would I do that?\nWell, let's think about\nthe very modern version\nof the kind of acronyms that\nI talked about a moment ago,\ndating back to the 1930s and\nextending into the 1990s.\nYou can find beautiful talks online\nfrom people who have worked\nwith some of the biggest companies\nand greatest high performers out there,\nto achieve incredible things.\nAnd they will talk about generating a sort\nof objective mindset for goal setting.\nThey'll talk about goals\nneeding to be significant.\nThat it has to be a big goal.\nThat it has to be concrete,\nso you have to be able to\ndescribe what the goal is.\nIt has to be action-oriented,\nhas to be inspirational,\nhas to be time-bound.\nYou have to have reasonable,\nrealistic, verifiable measures.\nYou have to constantly up the ante.\nIf it's starting to sound repetitive,\nit's because it is repetitive.\nThere are basically only\nthree or four elements,\nto goal setting and goal pursuit.\nBasically, an individual\nor set of individuals,\nhas to identify a specific thing\nthat they're going to attain.\nIn some communities, they talk about,\nknowing what right looks like,\nmeaning being able to\ndefine a very specific goal.\nYou can't just say, I want\nto be a champion athlete.\nYou have to say what sport,\nand you have to understand\nwhat the path to that is.\nSo any big goal of course,\nis broken up into a\nseries of smaller goals,\nbut the whole thing starts with thinking\nabout the end in mind.\nAnd in a few minutes, we will talk about,\nwhether or not visualization\nof the end in mind,\nis actually beneficial or\ndetrimental to achieving goals.\nThere's actually great\nneuroscience and psychology data\non that now.\nSo, I mentioned all these acronyms,\nnot as an attempt to disparage them.\nI think they're wonderful.\nAnd I mentioned all that\npsychology literature,\nnot in an attempt to disparage it,\nbut rather just say that, goal\nsetting is the first step,\nassessment of whether or\nnot one is making progress\ntowards those goals is the\nsecond but necessary step.\nAnd then there's the\nbusiness of goal execution.\nAnd that brings us back to\nthe neural circuit components,\nremember, this neural circuit,\ninvolving those four things earlier,\nthe amygdala, striatum,\norbitofrontal cortex\nand the prefrontal cortex.\nThey work together,\nto divide the whole process\nas I mentioned before,\ninto two general categories.\nThe first is, assessing value,\nknowing whether or not where\none is at one given moment,\nrelates to some external thing.\nAre things going well\nor things going poorly?\nAnd knowing how to gauge that accurately.\nAnd then, action steps, goes and no goes,\ndo more of this, do less of that,\ndo this, don't do that, et cetera.\nSo, now we are going to shift\nback to the neuroscience\nand we're going to talk about\nthe practical applications\nof the information I just described.\nBecause I've given you a lot\nof kind of academic information.\nAnd as we do this, I'd\nlike you to keep in mind,\nwhat are some things that\nyou've either accomplished\nor that you'd like to\naccomplish going forward?\nBecause as we do this,\nwe can build toward a set of protocols,\nthat at the end, you'll be\nable to very quickly plug in,\nyour particular goals and a\nroute to those particular goals,\nthat's grounded in the science.\nThat I think are going\nto be very effective\nin allowing you to reach\nthose goals, more quickly\nand with indeed less effort.\nIn fact, let's start with a tool now\nbecause as we move through\nall this information,\nI want to make sure that\npeople are coming away\nwith some practical things\nthat they can implement.\nAnd indeed, some things\nthat you can even do\nduring the course of listening\nto or watching this podcast.\nThe first thing to do, is\nto understand the difference\nbetween peripersonal space\nand extra personal space.\nPeripersonal space, is\nall the space, literally,\nthat's within inside your body,\nthe surface of your skin and\nin your immediate environment.\nPeripersonal space, is a\nkey concept in neuroscience\nbecause you have\nparticular neural circuits\nand particular chemicals,\nthat are geared toward,\nwhat are called consummatory\nbehaviors, meaning,\nusing things and consuming\nthings and enjoying things,\nthat are in your immediate\nperipersonal space.\nLet me give you an example\nof this for myself,\njust to make it concrete.\nYou can imagine similar\nexamples for yourself right now.\nWithin my current peripersonal\nspace, is my interoception,\nmy understanding or perception\nof my internal body.\nSo, how quickly I'm\nbreathing, my heart rate,\nthe feelings on the surface\nof my skin, et cetera.\nBut also, within the confines\nof my peripersonal space,\nis this coffee mug,\nthat if you're listening to\nthis, you can't see this,\nbut I'm lifting up a coffee mug,\nI'm going to take a sip of coffee.\nThat's a consummatory\nbehavior, I have the coffee,\nI don't have to do much or\nmotivate much to get it.\nI have other things here,\npens and computer, et cetera.\nSo things in your peripersonal space\nand consuming those things,\nis generally governed by\na set of neurochemicals,\nthat center around the\nneuromodulator serotonin.\nAnd there are a few others as well,\nthings like oxytocin,\nbut mainly serotonin.\nContrast that, with the\nso-called, extra personal space.\nExtrapersonal space is everything\nbeyond the confines of my reach.\nIt would be something in the next room.\nIt will be something down the street.\nIt will be something\nat some other location,\nin space and time.\nAnd the neuromodulators\nand neurochemicals,\nthat are associated with\nany kind of thinking about,\nanything in the extra personal space,\nare distinct from the\nneurochemicals and neuromodulators,\nthat are involved in thinking\nabout or making actions\ntowards the peripersonal space.\nAnd the molecule that's most\nassociated with thinking about\nor orienting toward the\nextra personal space,\nagain, things beyond\nthe confines of my skin\nor your skin, is dopamine.\nAnd this is a vitally important\nconcept to understand,\nwhen you're setting\ngoals and seeking goals.\nIf we are to be good at goal seeking,\nif we are to be good at setting\ngoals and assessing goals,\nif we are to achieve our goals,\nwe have to be able to\ntoggle back and forth\nbetween a clear understanding\nof our peripersonal space,\nwhat we have and how we feel\nin the immediate present.\nAnd our ability to\nunderstand what's out there\nin the extra personal space\nand our ability to move into\nthat extra personal space.\nAnd a simple way to conceive of all this,\nis that we evaluate our progress\nin the peripersonal space.\nWe evaluate how we feel,\nabout some pursuit,\neven if we haven't\ninitiated that pursuit yet.\nHow we feel about a particular goal,\nis truly a feeling that we\nexperience in the here and now,\neven though the goal is in the future.\nIf we are going to\nevaluate whether or not,\nwe made progress today\nor yesterday or not,\nthat's an evaluation of how we feel\nin the immediate peripersonal space.\nHowever, moving toward any goal,\ninvolves orienting our thinking\ntowards the extra personal space.\nAnd as we go through today's episode,\nI'm going to teach you a technique\nor rather a neuroscience-based tool,\nthat will allow you to continually\ntransition back and forth\nbetween the peripersonal space\nand the extra personal space\nin a way that will allow\nyou to update and evaluate\nand better execute your goal seeking.\nThe whole principle behind\nthis, is that human beings,\nlike other animals,\nhave to make evaluations\nabout whether or not they\nare on the right track.\nHowever, the important\nthing to understand,\nis that humans in particular can do this\nover different timescales.\nWe don't just pursue food\n'cause we are hungry,\nwe pursue food, excuse\nme, for a particular meal,\nthat we might be having\nwith people tomorrow.\nWe can modulate the timescale\nin a way that other animals don't.\nThat's how we adjust our goal seeking,\nto different timescales.\nAnd in addition to that,\nhumans are exquisitely good\nat biasing our behavior\ntoward particular goals over\nvery long periods of time.\nBut there are a lot of mistakes out there,\nin fact, things that are\noutright wrong in the literature\nand in particular, in the internet,\nand then the kind of wellness and fitness\nand cognitive fitness space,\nthat send people down the wrong path\nand those things we will\ntalk about in a few minutes.\nBut things like visualization,\nthat visualization\nand visualization of this big goal,\nis the best way to achieve your goals.\nIn fact, that's not the case,\nthere's a much approach to doing all this.\nSo now I'd like to shift gears\ntowards talking about a few of the things,\nthat most people get badly wrong\nin setting and assessing\nand executing goals.\nThis is based on peer reviewed research,\nso I think it's very solid.\nI know it is very solid.\nAnd it runs counter to what\nmany of us have been taught.\nLet's start with a simple one.\nWe've all heard that multitasking is bad.\nWe've heard multitasking is\nbad, it doesn't allow for focus.\nIf you want to achieve anything,\nif you want to accomplish\nanything, you should not multitask.\nWell, it turns out, that's wrong.\nIt turns out that there is\na role for multitasking,\nbut the multitasking has to\nbe placed at a particular time\nwithin your goal seeking behavior\nin order to be effective.\nReally nice studies done at\nCarnegie Mellon University,\nand the Davis Lab,\nevaluated how long\npeople are able to focus\nin different environments.\nHow long they were able to stay\nconcentrated on their work.\nAnd it turns out that\nnumber is exceedingly low.\nIt turns out that most people,\nwhether or not they're doing computer work\nor whether or not they're doing writing\nor accounting work or\nanything of that sort,\ncan hold their attention for\nabout three minutes at a time\nbefore they shift their attention off.\nAnd that's ridiculously\nlow when you first hear it,\nbut, that probably reflects a\nbasic state of brain function.\nThat hearkens back to a time\nwhen we were hunter gatherers,\nI doubt that we were maintaining\nfocus solidly for hours\nand hours and hours,\nunless we were under\nsome particular threat\nor in some particular crisis.\nRather, you could imagine\nthat people collected seeds\nand nuts and berries\nfor about three minutes\nand then probably stood up, looked around\nand then kept going.\nOr that they were hunting animals\nor in some sort of pursuit,\nfishing, et cetera,\nand focused, focused, focused\nand every three minutes or\nso, they might've looked up\nand, you know, take a look at the sky\nor looked around to make sure\nthat other people were there\nor not there, et cetera.\nIt all stands to reason\nthat that will be the case.\nAgain, the neural circuits\nhaven't evolved much.\nNow, multitasking, has been shown\nto have a very interesting\nphysiological signature,\nwhen we multitask,\nwhen we jump back and\nforth between things,\nthere is an increase in the\nlevel of the neurotransmitter,\nalso sometimes called a neuromodulator,\nbut basically same thing\nfor sake of this discussion.\nThere's an increase in the\nneurotransmitter epinephrine,\nwhich is adrenaline.\nAnd so, there are really nice studies now,\npointing the fact that doing\na bit of multitasking prior,\nto jumping into some focused,\ngoal directed behavior,\nwhether or not it's mental\nbehavior or physical behavior,\ncan actually be useful\nbecause it gets us into action.\nSo we've all been told that\nmultitasking is terrible,\nbut if you, for instance,\nfind yourself cleaning up your house\nand also checking your phone\nand doing a number of things,\nright at the point where you\nshould be sitting down to write\nor do some focused work.\nIt probably reflects\nsome adaptive mechanism,\nwhere you use action and somewhat\nvaried multitasking action\nin order to generate\nadrenaline in your system,\nbecause adrenaline just\ngets you in the action.\nNow, that's great,\nbut, you don't want to multitask\nthroughout any kind of goal seeking\nor goal pursuit behavior.\nBecause, what's also very clear\nand we're going to talk about\nthis in exquisite depth today,\nis that visual focus\nand in particular contracting\nyour visual window,\nbringing the aperture of what\nyou see, to a very fine point,\ncan absolutely increase\nyour clarity of goal seeking\nand the likelihood that\nyou will pursue your goals.\nI've talked about this a little\nbit before on the podcast\nas a way of increasing focus\nfor any kind of pursuit.\nI've talked about a practice,\nwhereby you can literally\nlook at a dot or a line,\nplaced on a wall or on your\ncomputer in front of you\nfor 30 to 60 seconds,\nand then moving into some dedicated work,\nwhere you need to focus.\nAnd indeed, just looking at a narrow piece\nof the visual world, a small\npiece of the visual world\nfor some period of time\nand forcing yourself to hold\nthat gaze on that location\nas best you can,\ncan increase your level\nof cognitive attention\nand your ability to\nfocus and stay focused.\nAnd this is not magic.\nIt is the consequence of the fact,\nthat most of your cognition\nfollows your visual perception.\nFor those of you that are\nlow vision or no vision,\nmeaning you're blind, or\nyou have trouble seeing,\nmy lab does a lot of work with people,\nwho are low vision, no vision.\nThey tend to use their\nauditory system, their hearing,\nas a way to anchor their\nattention to particular things.\nBut most people out there\ncan see and see pretty well\nand visual focus is the way to do that.\nNow, earlier, we were\ntalking about this notion\nof peripersonal space\nversus extra personal space.\nAnd I'm just going to seed a little bit\nof the later conversation by saying,\nthat when we focus on an external point.\nWe are in a process of exteroception,\nis the focus on the extra personal space,\nnot the peripersonal space.\nSo when we focus on something,\nsay a line on the wall\nfor 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer\nfor 30 to 60 seconds and just look at it\nand then move into any kind of action,\nwhether or not it's work\naction or physical action.\nWe are at its very core.\nWe are engaging in this pursuit\nof extra personal space.\nWe are placing our focus outside our body\nand therefore we are placing the brain\ninto goal pursuit mode.\nWork at NYU, in particular,\nin the laboratory\nof a phenomenal researcher in\ntheir Psychology Department,\nby the name of Emily\nBalcetis, B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S.\nEmily Balcetis, has done\nreally nice work on this.\nThey've done is, they've had,\npeople focus their visual attention\non a goal line of some sort\nand then to engage in\nsome sort of behavior,\nthat requires a lot of effort.\nAnd they've done a lot of\ndifferent experiments like this,\nbut I'll just explain one.\nThey always include a control group,\nwhere people have to go through\nthe same physical effort\nor mental effort,\nbut they don't focus their\nattention just on one location.\nThe long and short of\nthese studies is that,\nwhen people have to focus their\nattention on one location,\nlike a goal line,\nthey are much more effective\nin reaching those goals\nand they achieve them with the perception,\nthat they expended less effort.\nI'll give you an example of\none particularly nice study\nfrom the Balcetis Lab.\nSo this particular study\ninvolves, physical exercise.\nAlthough, as I mentioned before,\nthey've done similar studies\nlooking at cognitive type work.\nAnd what they did is they\nhad a group of people,\nexercise, wearing 15 pound ankle weights,\nand they had to basically\nmove a certain distance\nor run a certain distance\nto reach a goal line.\nOne group was focused on the goal line,\nvisually focused, on the goal line.\nThe other group was not\ntold to visually focus\non the goal line.\nAnd what they found, was\nthat the group that focused\non the goal line, was able\nto achieve reaching that goal\nwith 17% less effort.\nThey measured effort and\nthey got there 23% quicker.\nThat's a remarkable difference.\nSo same distance traveled,\nwith same workload\nbecause everyone's wearing\nthe same 15 pound weights\non their ankles.\nOne group is simply\nlooking at the goal line,\nthe other group is not told\nto look at the goal line,\nsimply by looking at the goal line,\ndoes something to the psychology\nand end physiology of these people,\nthat allows them to move forward\nwith less perceived effort\nand to do it more quickly.\nThat's remarkable.\nAnd in this case, they're\nfocused on the goal line,\nbut in a few moments,\nwe'll talk about how one can\nuse updating of goal line,\nso incremental goal line.\nStarting with an intermediate goal,\nand then extending the goal\nline further and further.\nBut just sit back for a\nsecond and think about that,\njust by changing where a person looks,\nthey changed their perceived effort\nand their ability to do\nsomething, more effectively,\nmore quickly, than a group that\nis not deliberately focusing\ntheir visual attention on one location.\nThat's incredible.\nAnd it's so incredible,\nin fact, you might say,\nwell, how could that possibly be?\nWell, it turns out, it\nhas a very specific,\nunderlying physiological reason\nand that has to do with changes\nin our so-called,\nautonomic nervous system.\nThe aspects of our nervous system,\nthat prepare us for readiness and action,\nor that prepare us for\nresting and relaxing.\nSo what is special about\nfocusing one's visual attention\nat a given location?\nWell, it turns out that\nwe have two branches\nof our visual system.\nSo visual information all\ncomes in through our eyes,\nbut then it can head down\ntwo different pathways.\nOne pathway is engaged\nwhen our vision is brought\nto a common point,\nwhat we call, a vergence eye movement.\nSo if we're focusing very\nintensely on a given point,\nregardless of how far away\nfrom us that point is,\nour visual system engages\na certain set of neurons,\nneural circuits that are\ninvolved in resolving fine detail\nand that can evaluate small changes\nover small periods of time.\nJust think of it as a very detailed camera\nof the visual world.\nIt tends to be very restricted.\nThe other pathway through\nthe visual system,\nis the so-called, magnocellular pathway.\nAnd this is a pathway that's involved\nin taking in global information\nabout lots of things,\nthat are happening around us.\nMovement of things to our right,\nmovement of things to our left,\nthings are happening down on\nthe ground and all around us.\nAnd that pathway involves a\nsort of relaxation, if you will,\nof the neural circuits that are associated\nwith alertness and attention.\nWhen you walk down the street\nand you're not thinking about much,\nprovided you're not looking at your phone,\nyou're not focusing on one location,\nyou're more or less in a relaxed state,\ncompared to when you're\nlooking for a particular sign,\nyou're looking for a bus\nor a train that's coming,\nor a particular person.\nAnd that should inherently make sense,\nwhen your level of attention\nand alertness goes up,\nthere's sort of a small,\nbut perceptible increase\nin your level of arousal.\nIt's not really stress necessarily,\nbut arousal of alertness.\nAnd it turns out that the visual system,\naccomplishes this increase\nin alertness by communicating\nwith your circulatory system\nand the system that\ndelivers blood and nutrients\nand oxygen to the rest of\nthe tissues in your body.\nSo let's talk for a second\nabout what focusing our vision\non a particular location does\nbecause in this study\nfrom the Balcetis Lab,\nwhat they found was, focusing\non a goal line allows people,\nto move more effectively toward that goal.\nThis is something you can\nleverage in all aspects\nof all goal pursuits.\nWhat happens when we focus\non a particular location?\nBelieve it or not,\nthere's an increase in\na particular feature\nof our blood pressure.\nNow your body has, of course, arteries,\nveins and capillaries,\nand your heart pumps blood,\nfirst to the arteries,\nand then to the other components\nof your vascular system.\nAnd we have so-called, blood pressure.\nBlood pressure is just how much,\nthe fluid volume is\npressing on those arteries,\nveins and capillaries.\nSo you can imagine a pipe\nwith very little fluid moving\nthrough it, that's low pressure.\nYou have a pipe with a lot\nof fluid moving through it,\nthat's even more pressure.\nYou have a pipe with a lot\nof very viscous, meaning,\nvery kind of sticky, thick\nstuff, moving forward,\nthat's even more pressure.\nWe have blood pressure\nand you've probably had your\nblood pressure measured.\nThere's always two numbers.\nYou have a top number, which\nis the systolic blood pressure.\nAnd then there's the bottom\nnumber, below the line,\nwhich is the diastolic pressure.\nSo the important thing to understand,\nis that your blood pressure\nwill rise when your heart beats,\nbecause there's more fluid\nmoving through those pipes\nthat are your arteries or\nveins and your capillaries.\nAnd that top number is called the systole\nor the systolic blood pressure,\nbecause that's the pressure at the time,\nwhen your heart contracts.\nSo the top number, which normally,\nif you have a healthy blood pressure,\nis somewhere in the range\nof 90 to 120 millimeters\nof mercury. Millimeters of\nmercury is just the way,\nthat pressure is measured.\nThat top number, your systole,\nor your systolic blood pressure,\nis what's measured when\nthe heart contracts.\nSo, that's the amount of\npressure when there's a heartbeat\nand it's moving through your vasculature.\nNow, between beats, the\nheartbeats, but then it relaxes,\nyour blood pressure is going\nto drop to a lower value\nbecause fluid isn't being\npumped through the system\nat those moments.\nAnd that's the bottom,\nthe diastolic pressure.\nAnd typically for healthy people,\nthat's going to be 60 to\n80 millimeters of mercury.\nSo you might hear about a normal\nblood pressure being about,\nagain, this is an\napproximate, 120 over 80.\nWhat that means is,\nat the point where blood was\nbeing pumped through there,\nyour arteries and veins, boom,\nthat it's 120 millimeters of mercury,\nbut then, when the heart\nrelaxes for a second\nbefore the next beat, then it drops to 80.\nSo there's high pressure, low pressure,\nhigh pressure, low pressure.\nThe fluid is being pumped\nthrough the system.\nNow, why am I telling you all this?\nWell, it turns out, that\nthere are neural circuits\nthat link your visual system\nand focusing on a particular\npoint with that top number,\nthe systolic blood pressure.\nAnd when you focus your eyes\non a particular location,\nthat systolic blood pressure goes up,\nand there are some other systems\nthat are coordinated with\nit in your brain and body,\nthat start releasing adrenaline,\nlow amounts of adrenaline in most cases.\nAnd that adrenaline, further\nreadies your body for action.\nSo, bringing our visual focus\nto a particular location,\ndoes a number of things to the brain\nand the whole system of\nthe body, to prepare it,\nto place it into a state of readiness\nthat makes us more likely\nto lean into our goals\ninto action. And if we step\nback and think about this,\nthis makes perfect sense.\nThe brain and body need to be coordinated.\nWe can't just think about a goal.\nIn fact, a deer or a lion,\ncan't just think about a goal.\nIt has to think about a goal\nand then has to feel some sort\nof activation energy,\nsome willingness or desire to move forward\nin pursuit of that goal.\nSo imagining a goal, has to be coupled\nto the physical pursuit of the goal.\nSo our visual system in a beautiful way,\nbrings together a focus, literally,\na visual focus on a\nparticular point outside us.\nThen it recruits an increase\nin systolic blood pressure,\nwhich creates a systemic, a body-wide\nand brain-wide increase\nin fuel utilization,\nin oxygen availability,\nin our willingness to\nmove forward as a body,\nas a whole coherent system.\nAnd then there are also\nneurotransmitter systems,\nlike epinephrine, as we\nwill soon see dopamine,\nthat get recruited as well\nto place us into a\ncontinual mode of action.\nThis to me is a remarkable\nfeature of our physiology\nand it gets right to the point\nof some of the psychological phenomenon\nthat we were talking about earlier.\nLet's just recall what some of those are.\nI won't list them all,\nbut, a goal has to be\nsignificant, they say.\nAll the psychologists, all\nthe popular stuff online says,\nit has to be significant,\nhas to be inspirational\nand has to be action oriented.\nSo let's say you look\nout into the landscape\nof what's available to you,\nwhether or not it's just in your mind,\nor you look at a specific point, you say,\nI want to go to that\nparticular restaurant,\nto eat that particular food.\nAnd you orient towards it\nand you move towards it.\nThis is the way that your brain and body,\nare coordinating their actions together.\nConversely, when our visual system,\nis in a mode of looking at everything.\nWhen the aperture of our\nvisual system is very broad,\nwe know that there's also a reduction\nin our goal directed behavior\nand a reduction in the\nsystolic blood pressure.\nIt's as if our peripersonal\nspace is sufficient,\nwe don't need to get\nbeyond our current state.\nWe're not oriented toward\nany one thing in particular.\nSo I've now described\nsome of the psychology\nand some of the underlying physiology.\nNow, I'd like to mesh\nthis within the context\nof actual specific goal\nsetting and goal pursuit.\nBecause what many of you\nare probably thinking is,\nwell, that's some physiology,\nthere's some psychology,\nbut how do you actually apply this\ntowards setting and achieving goals?\nWell, you do that, by understanding\nthat your mental frame\nand your attention are\nalways either positioned,\nto your peripersonal space,\nfocused on your immediate\npossessions and state,\nor towards things outside you.\nBut then you also have the ability,\nto dynamically travel back\nand forth between those.\nAnd so next, we're going to talk about,\nwhat the literature says about\nthings like visualization,\nimmediate and intermediate goals,\nlong-term goals and how\nto best achieve those.\nAnd then we're going to move specifically\ninto the protocols that you can use.\nIt's a protocol that I've\nspecifically developed\nfor you, the listeners,\nin order to incorporate all\nthe signs into a best practice,\nthat you can do any time, any place,\nto really identify what\nit is specifically,\nthat you want to pursue\nand the best route to pursue\nand achieve that goal.\nFocusing our visual attention\non one particular point,\nis incredibly effective for\nall types of goal pursuit.\nAnd if you'd like to read\nsome of the scientific studies\nor read a review of\nthe scientific studies,\nthat have looked at how,\nnarrowing one's visual attention,\ncan really enhance the\neffectiveness of pursuing goals,\nI'll put a link to this study.\nThe title of the study is,\nkeeping the goal in sight,\ntesting the influence of\nnarrowed visual attention\non physical activity.\nAnd this is a paper from\nEmily Balcetis's Lab,\nfocuses mainly on physical activities,\nbut it mentioned some\nother things as well.\nThis is an article published in\nPersonality and Social\nPsychology Bulletin in 2020,\nso it's recent.\nIt's an exceptional paper in my opinion,\nreally gets to the heart\nof how all this works\nand some of the examples of\nwhere it's been implemented.\nSo let's apply this visual\ntool, in a very simple way,\nto any type of goal\nthat you want to pursue.\nIf you already know what\ngoal you want to pursue,\nmaybe it's a workout,\nmaybe it's a cognitive work\nof some particular sort.\nAgain, the process is very simple.\nYou're going to focus your\nvisual attention on one point\nbeyond your peripersonal space,\nso it could be on your computer.\nIt could be on the wall,\nit could be a horizon.\nIt could be at a distance\nand you're going to focus\nyour visual attention there.\nAnd with some effort you're going\nto hold your visual attention\nfor 30 to 60 seconds, you\nmight blink, that's okay,\nbut you're going to try\nand hold your visual attention there.\nSo no moving your head around.\nNo diverting your attention\nto other locations.\nSome people will find it very easy to do.\nOther people will find it quite hard.\nYour mind may drift\ncognitively, that's okay,\nbut try and bring your visual attention\nto that common point.\nSeveral episodes ago, I talked about how,\nthere are actually studies\nlooking at developing this kind\nof training in students, for ADHD\nand the data on that are\nactually quite encouraging.\nSo for people who have ADHD\nand focus issues and attentional issues,\nthis can be effective.\nFor people who don't, this\ncan also be effective.\nAgain, it places your brain and body\ninto a state of readiness\nand then the idea is to move\ninto the particular actions,\nthat bring you closer to your goal.\nWe haven't yet talked\nabout how to set goals\nand how to assess progress.\nThis is simply how to pursue goals.\nBut the visual component is important,\nin fact, I would argue\nthat the visual system\nand harnessing your visual\nattention to a narrow point,\nis going to be the most effective way,\nto get your brain and body\ninto a mode of action,\nto pursue whatever goal it\nis you're trying to pursue.\nThat practice is in stark\ncontrast to multitasking,\nwhere by definition\nyour attention is moving\nfrom place to place to place.\nI mentioned that\nmultitasking can be effective\nin getting your system into somewhat\nof an increased level of activation,\nso that you can pursue\na more focused goal.\nBut the visual attention\nto a particular point,\nis going to be the most effective\nway to bring your system\ninto a state of readiness\nand action for goal pursuit.\nThere's another really interesting way,\nthat you can leverage your visual system\ntoward long-term goals.\nThe Balcetis Lab has also done,\nsome really interesting experiments,\nlooking at people's ability to set\nand stick to long-term goals.\nAnd the long-term goal\nthat they looked at,\nwas one related to saving\nmoney for later in life.\nThis is something that a\nlot of people struggle with,\na lot of people have a\nhard time investing money\nor saving money for later in life.\nSimply because as human beings,\nwe vary in the extent to which we worry\nabout what's going to happen later.\nThere's also a phenomenon of\nso-called, delay discounting.\nDelay discounting, is the fact that goals,\nbecome less rewarding when\nthey exist further out\nin the future.\nYou may have experienced this\nwalking past a donut shop.\nI love donuts\nI'm just going to admit it,\nover and over again on the spot.\nI love the smell of them.\nI love the taste of them.\nI try to eat them\n'cause I'm told they're\nnot that good for me\nand indeed, I don't think they are.\nI occasionally cave and\nI'll eat one or many.\nBut in general,\nI try not to cave to the\nimmediately rewarding properties\nof the smell and the taste of the donut.\nBut, what we know is\nthat if you smell a donut\nor you smell a wonderful piece of food,\nin the immediate term, it\nbrings your level of focus,\nyour mental focus to the immediate phase.\nAnd it feels very rewarding,\nlike if you had it now,\nit would just be so good.\nBut if you actually extend\nthat reward out to tomorrow\nor the next thing you think,\ntoday happens to be a\nSaturday, that we're recording,\nbut, on Tuesday morning,\nI'm going to get a donut.\nIt doesn't have the same value\nbecause the reward system,\ndoesn't work as well for long-term goals.\nIt's not as salient.\nIt's not as tangible, a goal,\nespecially for something like a donut.\nWhereas the kinds of goals that work,\nwhen you place them out to the longer term\nand can create a heightened\nsense of motivation,\ntend to be things that are\nmuch more rewarding to us.\nSo delay discounting simply says that,\nthe further out in time\nthat a given goal is,\nthe less effective that reward will be\nin motivating one's behavior.\nAnd indeed you see this with\nsaving money for retirement,\nyou see this with all sorts\nof long-term investment,\nThe Balcetis Lab, therefore\ndid an experiment,\nwhere they looked at people's tendency\nto save money for later in life.\nBut the groups that they\ncreated in this study,\nwere really interesting.\nThey had one group,\nimagine, what it would be like\nto be 30 or 40 years older.\nAnd then to invest a\ncertain amount of money,\naccording to whatever it is they thought\nthat they would need.\nAnd they measured the amount\nthat they had set aside and saved\nfor later in life.\nThe other group, actually\nviewed photos of themselves,\nso picture, images of themselves\nthat were artificially, digitally aged,\nso that they could see\nthemselves 30 or 40 years\ninto the future.\nAnd it turns out\nthat people in that second group,\nsimply by perceiving their\nown image, in the future,\ninvested far more money into later life.\nThey set aside more money.\nSomehow it bridged the gap\nbetween their immediate experience of life\nand the longer arc\ntoward what it was going to\nbe like in 30 or 40 years.\nSo very powerful result in my opinion,\nbecause what it says again,\nis that our visual\nperception of the future\nor our visual perception of the present,\nis what allows us to anchor\nour goal directed systems\nand our motivation to take on things\nthat in the immediate term\nmight not seem that useful.\nSo, you can imagine all\nsorts of variations on this.\nYou can imagine that\nevery time I want a donut,\nI'd see a vision of myself\nor an actual physical picture of myself\nas a consequence of having\neaten many donuts every day\nfor the next 10 years.\nI don't know what that\nimage would look like\n'cause I've never seen it.\nThat's not an experiment\nthat I necessarily need to do\nbecause I'm not that\nmotivated to eat donuts,\nbut I have to confess, I am somebody\nwho I think I'm pretty\ngood at managing resources.\nBut I think if I were to see\nan image of myself at 70 or 75,\nthere's so many things\nthat are associated with visual images.\nLike what our body must feel like,\nwhat our needs are\nprobably going to be like\nin that state or in that age.\nWhat sorts of things we may\nor may not still be\nable to do at that age.\nAnd that anchors back\nto immediate goal-directed behaviors,\nsuch as setting aside\nmoney for retirement.\nSuch as investing in\none's health practices.\nAnd indeed there's a study\nthat has looked at how people will invest\nin exercise and healthy eating.\nIf they just think about the future\nand what they might be like in the future\nversus seeing images of\nthemselves in the future,\nif they were to go down a\nhealthy or unhealthy route.\nSo again, the point is\nthat the visual system, what we see,\nis principally important\nin defining what we do\nin the immediate term.\nEven if what we see relates to something\nin the far off distance.\nI think these are phenomenal studies\nand they get right down\nto an important issue\nthat's been kicked around\nover and over in the literature\nand in the discussion about goal seeking,\nwhich is visualization.\nWe here keep the big goal in mind,\nfocus on the big goal.\nSo now we're going to address,\nwhat does the science say\nabout visualizing big goals?\nIf you're somebody who's\ninterested in business,\nor let's say you're\nfocused on relationship,\nis thinking about the perfect relationship\nand what that would look like\nand the family that you would have\nand where you would live.\nIs that effective in generating the kinds\nof behaviors that will lead you to that?\nIs it effective to think\nabout the big win at the end?\nWell, it turns out it is,\nbut you have to be very, very careful\nwith when and how you\nimplement that visualization.\n'Cause if you do it correctly,\nit can really serve\nyour goal seeking well.\nAnd if you do it incorrectly,\nit can undermine the entire process.\nSo, does visualization work?\nWell, turns out,\nthat visualization of the\nbig win, the end goal.\nSo the Superbowl win\nor eight gold medals in the Olympics\nor graduation from the\nuniversity of your choice\nor making a certain amount of money\nor finding the partner of\nyour choice, et cetera.\nThat visualization is effective\nin getting the goal\npursuit process started,\nbut it actually is a pretty lousy\nand maybe even counterproductive way\nof maintaining pursuit of that goal.\nMeaning continuing to\nengage the sort of actions\nthat are going to get you to\neventually achieve that goal.\nI think this is going to be\nsurprising to people, at first,\nbut if we think back to our discussion\nabout the physiology of\nthe blood pressure system,\nit'll make sense.\nGood scientific studies have been done\nwhere people are told to imagine,\nor even script out\ntheir long-term vision\nand goal for themselves.\nWhat is the big goal?\nAnd they're talked to,\nor told to imagine it with\na rich amount of detail.\nTo think about how it's going to feel\nin their body and the big win.\nAnd basically what happens is,\nif you measure people's blood pressure\nor other metrics of physiology,\nyou see an increase in that\nsystolic blood pressure.\nThere's an kind of a\nramping up of the readiness\nand excitement for that goal,\nbut that increase in blood\npressure quickly wanes.\nAnd over time,\nthat visual of the long-term goal,\nbecomes a poor thing\nto rely on in order to\ngenerate the actions\nthat are required to reach that goal.\nIn fact, there's a much better way\nto maintain ongoing action toward a goal\nthat also involves visualization,\nbut it turns out it's not\nabout visualizing success.\nIt's about visualizing failure.\nThe Balcetis Lab and other labs\nhave looked at whether or\nnot people make progress\ntoward goals of different types.\nWhether or not they're\nthinking about the goal.\nThey're thinking about that goal line\nand what they want to achieve,\nthat long-term goal\nand all the wonderful\nthings associated with it,\nor whether or not they're thinking\nabout all the ways in\nwhich they could fail,\nen route to that goal.\nThis is not typically what\nwe are encouraged to do.\nTypically, we are told\ndon't imagine failure,\npush failure out of your mind,\nonly focus on success.\nFake it till you make it,\nor is a phrase that I\nabsolutely hate, frankly,\nbecause it's not even\nclear what that means.\nAnd it's not even clear\nwhat the ethical form of that is.\nI think it means continue\ndespite any anxiety\nor fear that things won't work out.\nBut if you look at the literature,\nthe scientific literature,\nwhat the Balcetis Lab and\nother labs have shown,\nis that there's a near\ndoubling, near doubling\nin the probability of reaching one's goal,\nif you focus routinely\non foreshadowing failure.\nYou think about the ways\nin which things could fail,\nif you take action A or you take action B\nand instead, therefore, you take action C.\nYou're supposed to think\nabout how things could fail,\nif you don't get up and run each morning,\nif your goal is, say a fitness goal.\nSo let's use that as an example,\nbecause even though I realized,\npeople are in pursuit of many\nthings, not just fitness.\nFitness goals and physical\ngoals are a very concrete thing\nthat we can all get on the same page about\n'cause they're related to actions.\nLet's say, somebody sets a goal\nof running five miles,\nfour times a week, minimum,\nand as many as seven,\nfour times a week, minimum\nbefore 8:00 AM.\nIn a previous podcast on habits,\nI talked about the benefits\nof not necessarily setting specific times\nthat one will do things,\nbut setting time blocks\nthat one we'll do things.\nSo you say before 8:00 AM,\nyou're going to run five miles\nand that's going to happen\nup to seven days a week.\nOne version of this would be,\nokay, sit back in a chair\nand think about how great\nyou're going to feel and look,\nif you're doing this every day.\nHow your health is going to improve.\nHow everything's going to be,\nyour blood markers, of lipids, et cetera,\nare going to improve, okay, fine.\nThat's the visualization goal\nof visualizing the end point.\nIt turns out that is far less effective\nand maybe even counterproductive,\ncompared to thinking about\nwhat's going to happen,\nif you don't do this.\nThe negative health outcomes\nthat are going to occur,\nthe disappointment you're\ngoing to have in yourself.\nThe fact that you're\ngoing to wait until 7.30,\nthat's not long enough\nfor many people to run five miles.\nYou got to put on your shoes\nas there could be pouring rain\nor even hailing or snowing, outside.\nAnd now you're not going\noutside unless you're somebody\nwho's particularly motivated to do that.\nSo, foreshadowing failure turns out\nto be the best way to\nmotivate toward goal pursuit.\nIn fact, as I mentioned before,\nthere's a near doubling in the likelihood\nthat people will reach goals of any kind.\nWhen they're constantly thinking\nabout how bad it's going\nto be, if they fail.\nIf we think back to the\nneural circuit associated\nwith assessing value in our goal pursuits,\nthis makes perfect sense.\nThe amygdala, that center of the brain\nthat's involved in anxiety\nand fear and worry.\nWell, the amygdala, is one\nof the four core components\nof our goal setting and\ngoal pursuit circuitry.\nAnd there's no bypassing that.\nthere is no one listening to this\nor watching this who's\namygdala is not involved\nin their goal setting and\ngoal pursuit behavior.\nAnd so, while I'd love\nto be able to tell you\nthat all you should think\nabout is rainbows and puppies\nand all the wonderful, rewarding things\nthat are going to happen\nwhen you achieve your goals.\nThe truth is, you should\nbe thinking mainly\nabout how bad it's really going to get,\nif you don't do it.\nHow disappointed in yourself,\nyou're going to feel.\nHow it will negatively impact you,\nif not in the immediate\nterm, in the long-term,\nif indeed your goal is to reach your goal.\nSo, I want to emphasize\nthat I'm not interested\nin encouraging people\nto flagellate themselves.\nI'm encouraging people\nto achieve their goals.\nAnd it turns out the best way to do that,\nis by foreshadowing failure.\nAnd the more specific you can get\nby writing down or thinking about\nor talking about,\nhow bad it will be if you\ndon't achieve your goals,\nthe more likely you are\nto achieve those goals.\nPart of the reason for that\nalmost certainly has to do with increases\nin systolic blood pressure\nand increases in readiness in your system,\nwhen you imagine failure.\nThe brain and body are much better\nat moving away from fearful things\nthan towards things we want.\nI wish I could tell you\nthat wasn't the case,\nbut there is a true asymmetry\nin the way we are built.\nIn fact, the brain and body can engage\nin what's called, one trial learning.\nWhen something bad happens,\nwe eat a food that makes us sick.\nWe have an interaction\nwith a person or place\nthat we really don't like.\nIt only takes one trial to really...\nOne event, one time to reorient\nor rewire our neural circuitry,\nso that we have a bias toward moving away\nfrom that thing in the future.\nWhen things go well, unfortunately,\nthat doesn't often occur.\nIf things go really, really well,\nit might orient our brain and body\ntoward wanting more of that thing.\nAnd we'll have neural circuitry changes\nthat will lead us to engage\nin that particular behavior\nor interaction again,\nbut it is never as effective\nas these avoidance circuits.\nSo again, foreshadow failure,\nif you're going to\nvisualize in a positive way,\ndo that at the very beginning\nof some goal pursuit.\nMaybe intermittently\nevery once in a while,\nyou imagine the big win\nof scoring perfect on exam\nor winning the championship\nor the great relationship.\nBut most of the time,\nif you want to be effective,\nyou should be focusing on avoiding failure\nand you should be really clear\nabout what those failures would look like\nand feel like.\nNow, let's talk about goal setting.\nGoing back to that prominent literature,\nthe psychology and popular literature,\nagain, we can hear some of\nthese themes start to emerge.\nThe goal should be\nsignificant, we are told.\nIt should be inspirational.\nIt should be aggressive, yet realistic.\nWell, okay, that's all fine and good,\nbut let's get semi\nquantitative about this.\nLet's at least get biological about this.\nHow inspirational does it need to be?\nDoes it need to be the kind of thing\nthat is so inspiring to me\nthat I can't sleep at all?\nWell, that wouldn't be good\nbecause as I believe and I know,\nmany of you have heard me\nsay many, many times before,\nregular deep sleep, 80%\nor more of the nights\nthat you go to sleep,\nis going to be crucial to your cognitive\nand mental functioning and your ability\nto achieve your goals in the long-term.\nThat's absolutely clear.\nSo, it's got to be,\ninspirational and exciting,\nbut what does that really look like\nand what does that correspond to\nand how do we actually make that happen?\nWell, once again, there is a mismatch\nbetween what the real data show\nand what we're most often told.\nTurns out, that again,\nwork in Balcetis Lab,\nbut also other laboratories,\nhas addressed whether\nor not the probability\nof achieving a goal, goes up or down,\ndepending on whether or not one visualizes\nor sets a goal that is easy,\nmoderate or impossible.\nAn impossible goal would\nbe, for instance, if I say,\nI'm going to jump from my front driveway,\nall the way up to the road,\nthe road's, quite a distance away,\nit's more than 20 meters away.\nIt's just not going to happen.\nIt's not going to happen in this lifetime,\nit's not going to happen\nin any other lifetime.\nNot unless it involves\nsome elaborate technology\nthat I'm not aware of,\na jet pack or something like that.\nIt's just not going to happen.\nAn easy goal would be\nsomething like, can you jump?\nOr could I jump, two feet in\nfront of me, obviously, yes.\nNow I'm using a trivial example here,\nbut this could be translated\nto any kind of goal,\nschool goal, physical goal, et cetera.\nIt turns out that,\nwhen people set goals,\nwhether or not they are nutritional goals,\neat more of this or eat less of that.\nWhether or not they're fitness goals,\nrun more, lift more.\nSome other goals, swim less, swim more,\nwhatever it is their goal happens to be.\nSome learning goal,\nsome relationship goal,\nsome attempt to modify their behavior.\nIt turns out that if the goal is too easy,\nit's too within reach,\nit doesn't recruit enough\nof the autonomic nervous system\nto make pursuit of that goal, likely.\nNow that might be surprising,\nat least it was surprising\nto me, you think,\nwell, something is really, really easy.\nthere's a very low bar to achieve it.\nPeople are probably more likely to do it.\nBut turns out that's not the case,\nwhen we hear that a goal\nneeds to be inspirational,\nwhat do we mean?\nWhen we hear that something's too easy,\nto recruit our action, what do we mean?\nWell, Balcetis Lab measured,\nsystolic blood pressure,\nand found that,\nwhen goals were too easy\nfor people to attain,\nthey didn't get that increase\nin systolic blood pressure\nand recruitment of the other\nneural and vascular systems,\nmeaning the blood systems\nand the nervous system\nthat would place them into ongoing effort.\nAnd so they quickly gave up.\nAlso, if a goal was too lofty,\nif it was too far from\ntheir current abilities,\nit didn't recruit enough\nsystolic blood pressure.\nEven if people could get very excited\nabout something mentally,\nit simply didn't place their\nbody into a state of readiness\nbecause it wasn't tangible\nthat they could actually\nperhaps really achieve it.\nSo it turns out that\nwhen goals were moderate,\nwhen they were just outside\nof one's immediate abilities\nor that one felt that yeah,\nthat would take a lot of effort.\nBut it's within range or maybe in range,\nlike maybe I can do it, maybe I can't.\nThen there was a near doubling\nof the systolic blood\npressure in the good sense.\nIt didn't go into the unhealthy range\nand a doubling or more of the likelihood\nthat they would engage\nin the ongoing pursuit\nof that particular goal.\nSo here we're talking about goal setting.,\nwhat we're saying is, set\ngoals that are realistic,\nbut that aren't so\nrealistic, that they're easy.\nThe goals need to be realistic\nand truly challenging.\nDon't set goals that are\nso challenging and so lofty\nthat they crash that blood pressure system\nin the other direction and make you\nor anyone feel unmotivated.\nIn hearing this, it makes sense,\nbut I don't think I\nwould have predicted it,\nhad they not done this\nvery controlled study.\nI would have thought,\nthe loftier the goal, the bigger the goal,\nthe more that it recruits\nthe autonomic system\nand the more that people are likely,\nto lean into the energy\nand effort to pursue and attain that goal.\nI also would have thought\nthat if a goal is really easy to achieve,\nthat it would engage the systems\nof action in the brain and body enough\nthat people would sort of get into motion\nand pursue that goal.\nBut neither is the case.\nAgain, set goals that\nare difficult to achieve,\nbut that are not so lofty,\nthat they collapse your system\nand that you feel overwhelmed.\nAnd the important thing here,\nis that how we perceive a goal,\nwhether or not we think\nit's within reach or not,\nof course will vary,\ndepending on whether or not we are rested.\nDepending on whether or not other aspects\nof our life are going well.\nI mean, we can think that\nwe are hot on the heels\nof a lifetime goal and\neverything's going well,\nand then there'll be some\ncrisis interpersonal crisis,\nor there'll be a health crisis\nand you'll be shut down.\nAnd then that goal seems\nvery, very hard to attain.\nSo we will talk about how to update goals\nunder different context in a few minutes.\nBut, of course this is\ngoing to be an averaging,\nthis isn't something\nthat you do just once.\nBut the takeaway again is very simple,\nset goals that are\nmoderately hard to hard,\nbut not so hard nor so easy\nthat they don't engage your\nbrain and body properly.\nModerate goals are best,\nif you want to achieve your goals.\nNow I'd like to talk about\nthree particular areas\nof scientific study,\nthat point to goal pursuit,\ngoal assessment and goal achievement.\nPreviously I told you,\nthat it's great to foreshadow failure.\nThat that's a great way to get your system\ninto a state of activation.\nI also told you\nthat you want to set goals,\nthat are challenging but possible.\nAnd again, here, I'm paraphrasing\nfrom the work of Emily Balcetis.\nI want to be very clear.\nThere are a few other\nthings that one can do\nin order to bias the likelihood,\nthat you will succeed in\ntrying to achieve your goals.\nFirst of all, limit your options,\ntrying to pursue too many goals at once,\ncan definitely be counter productive.\nNow I realized that life is complicated.\nWe all have multiple goals\nthat we're trying to pursue,\nbut if we have particular\ngoals that are important to us,\nwe have to be careful to not\nget distracted by other goals.\nAnd many people run into this problem.\nSo setting one or two\nor maybe three major\ngoals for a given year,\nis going to be more than\nenough for most people\nand is actually going to be\nchallenging for most people.\nNow, of course we have daily\ngoals and monthly goals\nand yearly goals, but if\nwe have big lofty goals,\nwe need to be careful not to\ncontaminate our mental space\nand our visual space with too many goals.\nAnd why do I say visual goals? Well,\nwhat various department stores\nand supermarkets have discovered is that,\nthe greater, the number of\nthings in our visual attention,\nthe more that we can draw our attention\nand our goals off a line of pursuit.\nWhat does that mean?\nWell, let's think about it\nin the practical context.\nThis has actually been done.\nBig department stores have figured out\nthat if they stock their\nshelves, chock-a-block\nwith many, many options of food\nor clothing items or objects\nor anything like that,\npeople simply buy more stuff.\nPeople are very prone to\norienting their attention\nto whatever's in front of them.\nYou put a lot of stuff in front of them,\ntheir attention drifts,\nyou put fewer things in front of them,\ntheir attention is more narrow.\nIn a later episode, we'll talk\nabout designing a workspace,\nthat's optimized on the basis of this.\nIt doesn't mean being in a room\nwith nothing except just\nyour desk and a computer.\nDoesn't have to be that sparse,\nbut visual sparseness,\nactually can help us orient\nour focus and our behavior.\nWhen we have a lot of things\nin our visual environment,\nor a lot of things in our\ncognitive environment.\nIt's the same thing.\nAnd so if you're going to try\nand pursue a fitness goal,\na relationship goal, an academic goal,\nand a longterm life\nfinancial goal all at once,\nthat's four things.\nAnd you're going to have\nto come up with systems\nthat allow you to isolate those\ngoals in a very rigid way.\nAnd if you do have\nmultiple interleaving goals\nand overlapping goals\nand simultaneous goals,\nin a few minutes, we're going to talk\nabout a process that will allow you\nto use your visual system,\nto align towards each of\nthose goals, sequentially,\nin a way that makes it much more likely\nthat you'll achieve them.\nSo now let's talk about\nspecificity of goals.\nWe've all heard that the\nmore specific a goal is,\nand the more specific we are\nabout when and how we are\ngoing to execute that goal,\nthe higher probability\nthat we will actually achieve that goal.\nAnd indeed that's the case,\nbut there's an additional feature,\nthat's not often discussed.\nThat is vitally important.\nAnd in fact, maybe more important\nthan having a specific time of day\nor a specific end point in mind.\nThere's a really nice study,\nthat was done looking at recycling.\nThis is something that a number of groups,\nbusinesses, households,\nand individuals are trying to do more of.\nThey're trying to lower carbon footprint\nor contribute to the\nworld in some general way\nby throwing away fewer things\nthat could potentially be recycled.\nSo this has been studied\nin the context of the work environment,\nwhere a business decides\nand lets everybody know,\nthat there's going to be a greater effort\ntoward recycling cans or bottles\nor bottles and cans, et cetera.\nAnd then, the way these studies were done,\nis that the janitorial staff\nwas swapped out temporarily\nfor researchers that actually measured\nthe number of recyclable items\nthat showed up in the trash\nand not in the recycle,\nas a function of the\ntotal amount of trash.\nWhy'd I say, as a function\nof the total amount of trash?\nWhat's a way of controlling\nfor differences in beverage consumption\nfrom one week to the next?\nAnyway, the point is they were able\nto very carefully measure,\nhow much people are recycling\nbefore and after this call\nto action to recycle more.\nAnd what they found was,\nif they said, we are going\nto try and recycle more,\ntry not to put cans and\nbottles in the trash.\nThere of course was an\nimprovement in recycling,\nbut it was pretty modest.\nWhereas when there was\na very concrete plan\nand everyone knew what\nthat concrete plan was,\nfor instance, to place all bottles\nand cans into the recycle, not the trash\nor to limit the amount of trash by 50%,\nor to eliminate all recyclable\nitems from the trash.\nSo when they made it very concrete,\nexactly what the action steps were,\nthere was a remarkable,\nI mean, close to a hundred fold\nor more improvement in recycling behavior\nthat lasted many months\nafter this call to action was made.\nThe takeaway from this\nis quite straightforward.\nIt means that having a\nconcrete plan is essential.\nYou can't just say,\nI'm going to become a better recycler\nor I'm going to do things\nthat are better for the environment\nor I'm going to become\nmore physically fit.\nIt has to be a specific\nset of action steps\nthat get right down to details\nabout what success would look like.\nI've heard this before described\nas what does right look like?\nWhat is the actual outcome\nthat one would like to achieve\nin terms of action steps?\nSo not necessarily feeling states,\nit wasn't that they all\nsat around and said,\nhow great we're all going to feel\nabout ourselves in the world\nwhen we accomplish this goal?\nIt was very concrete\nstatements, very concrete plans\nabout action steps that would\ndeliver one to one's goal.\nSomewhat straightforward and intuitive,\nbut nonetheless worthwhile.\nWhat it suggests is that for all of us,\nif we have certain goals\nthat we want to achieve,\nwe need to be exquisitely detailed\nabout what the action steps are,\nthat we are going to take\nand to constantly update\nthose action steps,\nso that we have a higher probability\nof meeting those action steps.\nSome of you may be asking,\nhow often should one assess progress?\nWell, that of course will\ndepend on the given goal\nthat you're trying to pursue.\nBut in the studies\nthat I've been referring to here,\nthe assessment of progress\nand the updating of concrete\nplans was done weekly.\nSo it seems like weekly\nis a good starting place,\nto address how well one performed\nin the previous week.\nAnd then based on that performance\nto update the action plan\nfor the upcoming week.\nSo weekly seems like a\ngood solid rule of thumb\nfor setting particular action goals\nand assessing one's progress\ntowards the immediate\nand longer term goals.\nAny discussion about\ngoals and goal pursuit,\nwould be incomplete without a discussion\nabout the molecule, dopamine.\nDopamine is often thought of\nas the molecule of pleasure and reward,\nbut actually it is the\nmolecule of motivation.\nThis is best illustrated\nby a classic set of studies,\nthat have been carried out in\nboth animals and in humans.\nThe animal study can be\ndescribed the following way,\ntwo rats, each in a separate cage.\nYou can provide those rats\nwith the opportunity to indulge\nin something that they like,\nlike food or mating.\nOr heat, if it's cold in the environment,\nor a cool spot in the cage,\nif it's warm in the\nenvironment and so forth.\nAnd what you find is that,\nrats will very readily\napproach the rewarding thing.\nThey will, mate.\nThey will eat.\nThey will pursue something\nthat is of pleasure.\nNow, if you are to take one of those rats\nand deplete its dopamine neurons,\nyou can eliminate it's dopamine neurons\nor block dopamine in the brain.\nWhat you find,\nis that those animals\nwill still enjoy pleasure.\nThey will consume the food,\nthey will mate, et cetera.\nHowever, their motivation,\nto achieve pleasure is vastly reduced.\nIn fact, if you place\nthe item of pleasure,\nthe mate, the food, et cetera,\neven just one rat's\nlength away from that rat,\nthe rat without dopamine\nwill not even move one length\nof its own body in order\nto achieve that pleasure.\nAnd there are naturally\noccurring experiments\nin humans that mimic that\nresult, very accurately.\nThere are certain conditions in humans\nwhere there's a depletion of dopamine.\nAnd what you find is that,\nthe depletion of dopamine\ndoes not inhibit an ability\nto experience pleasure, necessarily.\nIt inhibits an ability to pursue\nor go through the series of action steps\nin order to achieve pleasure.\nSo dopamine, really sits\nat the heart of our motivational state,\nto seek out goals and to seek pleasure.\nAnd this is true for immediate goals\nthat take place within\na timeframe of minutes\nor a timeframe of a day,\nor the timeframe of a week or\nthe timeframe of a lifetime.\nDopamine, is the common currency\nby which we pursue goals.\nNow, dopamine does a number of things\nthat are very interesting.\nI'm going to describe a few of them\nas they relate to goal seeking behavior.\nFirst of all, there's\na fundamental feature\nof how our brain releases\nand uses dopamine,\nthat's called, reward prediction error.\nAnd the simplest way to think\nabout dopamine reward prediction error,\nis that dopamine is released\nin the greatest amount\nand places us into a\ngreater state of motivation,\nwhen something happens\nthat's positive and novel.\nNow, an important thing to\nunderstand about dopamine,\nis that it's not always released\non the same schedule.\nThere are a couple of different ways\nthat dopamine is released.\nAnd when it is released\nrelative to your anticipation\nof a reward, is key.\nIf you don't expect\nsomething positive to happen,\nyou're just going about your day\nand something positive happens,\ndopamine and a lot of\ndopamine is released.\nI had this happen recently.\nI had no idea\nthat I was going to be\nreceiving something in the mail,\nbut I went to the mail.\nI looked in the mail and I\ngot something very positive.\nAnd I was really, really\nexcited about this.\nThis is a real event that\nhappened, just today.\nHowever, if we anticipate\nsomething positive\nis going to happen\nand then that thing happens,\nwe experience dopamine as\npart of the anticipation.\nSo even before we get the reward,\nthere's an increase in dopamine.\nIt's not as high as it would be,\nif something really novel and unexpected\nand positive happened,\nbut we do get an increase in dopamine.\nAnd then, when we actually\nexperience the reward,\nwe experience the positive thing,\nthere's a smaller increase in dopamine.\nSo again, the biggest increases\nin dopamine are response\nto things that are\npositive and unexpected.\nLesser dopamine is released\nwhen we anticipate\nsomething good will happen\nand when that happens,\nyes, we get some dopamine.\nAnd we also get some dopamine\nwhen the positive thing happens,\nthink about anticipating\na great meal with friends.\nWe have some dopamine churning,\nour friends come over,\nthen we have the meal\nand we also get some dopamine from that,\nbut not nearly as much as we would,\nif it had all happened as\na part of a big surprise.\nThen, there's also the\ncase in which we predict\nthat something good will happen,\nwhen that happens, there's\nan increase in dopamine just\nas it was before,\nbut then if that thing doesn't happen,\nfor instance, our friends\ndon't show up for dinner,\nthen there's a drop in dopamine\nbelow our initial baseline.\nThat drop in dopamine,\nis the chemical essence of\nwhat we call, disappointment.\nNow, this dopamine reward\nprediction error, as it's called,\ncan be leveraged toward\ntrying to reach our goals\nbecause it tells us\nwhere we should set our milestones.\nWe can't be in a mode\nof simply being focused\non the finish line.\nVery few people can do that\nover long periods of time\nin a way that's effective.\nNow, earlier I talked about a study\nwhere people were focused\non a finish line visually,\nand they were moving through space\nwith these ankle weights on,\nbut that was a very short-term goal.\nSo, if a goal is within minutes,\nor maybe even within an hour\nor as in with our immediate\nvisuals environment,\nmaybe we can do that.\nBut most goals of the sort\nthat most people are\npursuing, fitness goals,\nacademic goals, business goals,\nrelationship goals, et cetera,\ninvolve some milestones.\nSo, understanding what we know\nabout reward prediction error,\nwe can make better choices\nabout where to place the milestones,\nhow far out in the future\nto place milestones.\nSo then the question becomes,\nhow often or at what intervals\nshould one assess progress?\nAnd it turns out this is very subjective,\nbut that there's a way\nto make it objective.\nNow, in a previous episode of\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast\",\nI had a discussion with\nthe great Robert Sapolsky\nand we were talking about,\nhow the brain can subjectively change\nwhether or not a given\nbehavior or experience,\nis positive or negative.\nAnd the example that Robert gave,\nis a really phenomenal one.\nIt's a study that's been done in rats\nand also in humans\nwhere they took a rat\nand they had a rat run on a running wheel.\nRats turns out like to\nrun them running wheels\nand the blood pressure of that animal,\nthe health metrics for that animal,\nthe lipid profiles, many,\nmany things improved.\nThe rat was exercising\nand it got healthier\nand presumably happier,\nwe don't know, we could've asked it,\nbut we wouldn't know. It\ndoesn't know how to tell us,\nbut we can measure blood lipids.\nWe can measure blood pressure\nand all sorts of things.\nAnd indeed, when that rat\nexercised or when people exercise,\nthey generally get healthier.\nExcept, in that particular experiment,\nthey had another animal\nwhere every time rat number one, ran,\nrat number two was forced to run.\nIt was on a running wheel\nand it was forced to run,\nnot because it wanted to,\nbut because it was forced to.\nAnd what was remarkable,\nis that the physiological effects\nof being forced to do something,\nwere in the complete opposite\ndirection as they were\nwhen those same behaviors\nwere undertaken voluntarily.\nIn other words, the rat\nthat was choosing to run,\ngot healthier\nand the rat that was forced\nto run became unhealthy,\nblood pressure went up in a direction\nthat wasn't effective and useful.\nBlood lipids got worse.\nStress hormones went up,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAnd you see the same thing in humans.\nNow, what this says,\nis that our subjective understanding\nof why we are doing something,\nis fundamentally important for the effects\nthat we will get from that behavior.\nAnd indeed the effects of\nthat behavior will have on us.\nSo this has two major implications.\nFirst of all, in terms\nof reward schedules,\nwe can decide to use any\nreward schedule that we want\nfor a given behavior.\nWe can decide that the milestones for a...\nLet's say a plan of getting\nin really terrific cardiovascular\nshape over the next year.\nWe can decide to assess every day\nand ask ourselves how\ngood was our progress.\nAnd if we made progress, then\nwe're going to reward ourselves.\nWe could do that every third day.\nWe could do it every week.\nWe could do it every five minutes,\nif we actually had the time to do that.\nThe reward schedule, the dopamine system,\nis highly susceptible to\nthe subjective effects.\nThese so-called, top-down effects\nof when we decide that something\nis going to be good for us,\nif we analyze it on a given timeframe,\nwell, then it's going to be good for us.\nSo, what I suggest people do\nis pick a particular interval\nat which they are going\nto assess progress.\nAnd if you've been making\nregular progress towards a goal\nthat you reward yourself\nand the reward indeed is all cognitive.\nIt's all mental.\nIt's telling yourself, yes,\nI'm on the right track.\nNow, some people will say, wait,\nbut I want to know exactly\nhow often I should do that.\nYou need to do that at an interval\nthat you can maintain consistently.\nSo you're not going to\nreward yourself every minute\nor every step of every jog that you take,\nunless you can do it,\nevery minute of every step\nof every jog that you take.\nFor that reason, I think that daily\nor ideally, weekly assessments\nare going to be best.\nI think that checking\nin at the end of a week,\nlooking back on the previous week\nand assessing how well you performed\nin pursuit of a given goal.\nHow many times a week you ran,\nor how many times you studied,\nor how many times you did\nsomething that you wanted to do\nor avoided something that\nyou didn't want to do.\nI think that's a reasonable\nand tractable schedule\nto assess once a week.\nSo that's one point,\nthat pick a milestone that\nyou can maintain consistently\nthroughout the pursuit of a goal.\nThe second thing, is that\nthe subjective effects\nthat were described by that Sapolsky study\nor that Sapolsky described\nrather, are absolutely essential\nfor all aspects of goal seeking behavior.\nWe cannot underestimate the extent\nto which the dopamine system and our sense\nof whether or not we\nare on the right track,\nis under our cognitive control.\nIf we constantly place ourselves\ninto a mode of thinking\nthat we are failing, well,\nthen indeed, we are not going\nto churn out much dopamine.\nNow, earlier, I said, we need to predict\nand visualize failure,\nbut that is not the same thing\nas thinking about ourselves as failing.\nWe need to predict what the\noutcome would be if we failed,\nbut then encountering that\nand in behaving in a certain way,\nand thinking in a certain way,\nin pursuing our goals in an effective way.\nMaybe checking in on that each week,\nwe definitely need to\nreward ourselves cognitively\nfor the correct and successful pursuit.\nWhat this means is that\nanticipate and think about failure\nas a mechanism of generating motivation\nand indeed fear and anxiety,\nso that you lean into\nthe correct behaviors\nand you lean away from\nthe incorrect behaviors\nto reach your goal.\nBut then weekly or so,\nwhatever you can maintain consistently,\nyou absolutely want to\nreward yourself cognitively\nby telling yourself,\nI'm on the right track.\nI got another week where I accomplish,\nwhatever it is that I'm\ntrying to accomplish.\nA concrete example that I'm following now,\nis this 150 to 200 minutes\nof zone two cardio per week,\nbecause that's shown to be very effective\nin improving mental and\nphysical health metrics.\nSo once a week, I'll check in with myself.\nIf I reach that 150 to\n200 minutes threshold,\nthen I'll reward myself simply\nby checking off a box and\nsaying, okay, I'm on track.\nI'm on track.\nI'm on track.\nThis dopamine system is critical to re-up,\nto remind ourselves that we are on track,\nif indeed we are on track\nbecause dopamine itself\nprovides a state of motivation\nand readiness to continue\nin the regular pursuit of our goals.\nDopamine, the molecule, is actually used\nto manufacture epinephrine\nand norepinephrine.\nWhich are other molecules\nin our brain and body,\nwhich put us into that\nreadiness and action state.\nThere are actually the molecules\nthat help generate that increase\nin systolic blood pressure,\nthat puts us into a state of readiness.\nSo you can think about dopamine\nas a self amplifying system,\nprovided that you are\nleveraging the dopamine system\non a consistent schedule.\nNow, by also following a\nconsistent schedule of self reward,\nyou set yourself up for any\npositive unanticipated rewards,\nthat may happen.\nSo for instance, if you're\nchecking in with yourself weekly,\ntelling yourself that you're doing well,\nif indeed you are.\nAnd then out of nowhere,\nfor instance, you're out on a run\nor you're doing something,\nI'm using fitness as an example.\nBut you're doing something,\nyou find yourself performing\nparticularly well,\nthat's a unexpected dopamine reward\nthat will further amplify the system.\nNow I know many people out there,\nhaving heard me talk about\ndopamine before, worry,\nwell, can I release too much dopamine\nand then the whole system will crash\nand then I'll run out of motivation?\nIn general, that doesn't happen\nunless people are using pharmacology,\nsupplements or prescription\ndrugs or illicit drugs\nto increase dopamine.\nThis is why I'm a big fan\nof things like, cold showers\nand cold water exposure,\nwhich has been shown to lead\nto long-lasting 2.5 X\nincreases in dopamine,\nor in some cases,\nsupplementation with\nthings like L-Tyrosine,\nwhich are precursors to dopamine.\nOr in some cases, caffeine,\nwhich can increase the number\nof dopamine receptors that we have,\nso that whatever dopamine\nwe have floating around\ncan be more effective\nin activating these motivational states.\nBut things that really increase dopamine\nand then cause it to\ncrash, can be problematic.\nOne way to conceive of dopamine,\nis as a sort of dopamine wave pool.\nYou've probably seen these wave pools,\nwhere some pressure is\npushed into the pool\nand then you get these waves going.\nIf those waves are consistent enough,\nand they're are of high enough amplitude,\nthe waves can continue to go\nup and down and up and down.\nBut if it's a giant wave,\nif you get a huge blast of dopamine,\nwell then a bunch of the water\nsloshes out of the wave pool\nand then you basically\nhave to take some time off,\nreset that dopamine level.\nThat's what happens in addiction\nand when people start\npushing in a lot of drugs\nor other things into the system\nthat increase dopamine too much.\nSo today we've almost\nexclusively been talking\nabout behavioral tools.\nIt is possible to incorporate supplements\nand things of that sort, that\ncan increase dopamine as a way\nto getting into ongoing\nmotivational states.\nBut I caution people about\nrelying on those too much.\nReally what you want,\nis you want a situation where\nyour own positive feedback,\nyour own understanding,\nthat you are reaching the milestones\nthat you've set out for yourself.\nThat you're achieving those,\nand that is what's causing these waves\nor these increases in dopamine\nthat will further amplify\nyour motivational states.\nAnother very interesting\naspect of dopamine\nthat I've not talked about at all\non this podcast before,\nis actually how the\ndopamine system interacts\nwith the visual system.\nWe've talked a lot about\nhow harnessing your visual attention,\nto a particular point is great\nand can help serve your\nability to both set\nand achieve goals.\nReally wonderful work that\nwas done by Wolfram Schultz,\nwho's one of the great pioneers\nin this area of dopamine\nand dopamine reward prediction error,\nshowed that for people that\nhave normal levels of dopamine,\ntheir visual search,\nmeaning how they scanned\nvisual environments,\ntends to be pretty constrained.\nThey might move their eyes\naround a particular visual\nenvironment, searching somewhat.\nFor people that lack dopamine,\nthey actually have very\nlittle movement of their eyes.\nThey don't actually tend to\nlook very far into the horizon.\nThey're don't have that\nvery focused vergence point\nthat we're talking about that kind of a...\nI guess for lack of a better phrase,\nthat kind of eye of the\ntiger, focus on a goal.\nRather, their eye movements are depleted\nand they're not actually\nevaluating horizons\noff in their future,\nthey're not focused so much\non the extrapersonal space.\nAnd this actually can be restored\nand some of these took place\nin Parkinson's patients\nand other people who\nhave dopamine depleted,\nthat when dopamine is\nrestored pharmacologically,\ntheir visual focus is re-enhanced again.\nNow, there are a lot of\ndetails to this study\nthat don't map perfectly onto everything\nthat I've talked about.\nBut the point is this, when we are focused\non a particular point in visual space\nor a particular goal or horizon.\nAll those systems, our\nblood pressure, epinephrine\nand indeed dopamine, get recruited\nto put us into a state of readiness\nand willingness to go pursue things\nin that extrapersonal space.\nWhen our visual attention is very diffuse,\nall of that relaxes,\nand we tend to be more comfortable staying\nin the place that we are,\nin our peripersonal space\nand the effect works in\nthe other direction too.\nWhen dopamine is increased,\nour visual attention for\nparticular things out in space,\nincrease.\nSo the way it works is reciprocal.\nWhen we use our visual system\nand in a particular way,\nbring it to a point of focus,\nit recruits chemical and neural systems\nin our brain and body\nthat put us into a state\nof readiness and pursuit.\nAnd, when we increase certain chemicals\nin our brain and body, like\nepinephrine, like dopamine,\nthen we also allow our visual system\nto be in a state of looking\nout at particular locations\nin our visual world.\nSo the system works in both directions\nand some people leverage this\nby using things like caffeine\nor taking things like\nL-Tyrosine to increase dopamine.\nAnd again, it works both ways,\nthere's no right or wrong way to do it.\nI'm a particular fan of\nusing behavioral tools,\nalways prior to using supplementation\nor any kinds of other tools\nbecause behavioral tools\nhave a very unique feature\nthat supplementation and\nother chemical tools don't.\nWhich is that behavioral\ntools used over time,\nengage neuroplasticity.\nAs we start to practice,\nusing our visual system\nto harness our attention\nto particular locations\nand in that way, move\nto our particular goals,\nwe get better and better\nat using those systems.\nIn fact, the systems for\nfocus and motivation,\nthemselves have plasticity,\nso we get better at being\nmotivated and focused\nwhen we place our visual\nattention at a given location.\nUsing chemical assistance of a safe kind,\nof course, check with your doctor.\nBut things like L-Tyrosine or\ncaffeine or those combined,\nyes, it will increase dopamine\nand will increase our ability,\nto engage in visual focus somewhat.\nBut those compounds alone,\ndon't modify the circuitry\nin the way that we want.\nSo I always say, behavioral tools first,\nthen nutritional tools,\nthen supplementation tools\nand then if it's right for you and safe,\nmaybe you advance into some\nof the other more sophisticated tools.\nI'd like to just briefly recap\nwhat I've covered up until now.\nAnd again, emphasize that much\nof what I've covered has been based\non the beautiful work of\nEmily Balcetis and colleagues.\nI do hope to get her as a guest\non the podcast, by the way.\nFirst of all, set goals that\nare challenging, but possible,\nthose moderate goals, not super\neasy, not super difficult.\nBut moderately challenging goals,\nseem to be the most effective\nin moving people towards their goals\nover the short and longterm.\nSecond, plan concretely,\nyou need a concrete set of actions\nthat you're going to follow\nin order to reach your goals.\nThird, foreshadow failure.\nThis is a somewhat surprising one to me.\nI would have anticipated,\nthat imagining success is the way to go.\nIt turns out that imagining\nsuccess and visualizing success,\ncan be useful at the outset of a goal\nand maybe every once in a while\nin pursuit of that goal.\nBut that it's not terrific for putting you\nin constant pursuit of that goal,\nrather, foreshadowing\nfailure, visualizing failure\nand all the terrible things\nthat it's going to bring,\nseems to be more effective.\nAnd that maps very well to what's known\nabout the neural circuitry\nand the involvement of the amygdala.\nFocus on particular visual points\nas a way to harness your attention\nand to remove distractors.\nRemoving distractors and\ngetting your body and brain\ninto a mode of activation.\nGetting that healthy increase\nin systolic blood pressure,\nthat puts you into forward motion\ntowards your goals, is absolutely key.\nSo that's a brief summary\nof what I've covered up until now.\nThere were other things too,\nof course, the dopamine system\nand the power of\nsubjective top-down control\nin regulating that dopamine system.\nBut I want to be sure to include a tool,\nthat's been especially powerful for me,\nthat's grounded in the\nneuroscience research\nand in the psychology research.\nAnd as I describe this tool next,\nI think you'll see the ways\nin which it measures nicely\nwith the work that Emily Balcetis\nand colleagues have done.\nThis is something that,\nI've personally been doing for many years,\nbased on my understanding\nof the visual system\nand the understanding that\nindeed we can move our cognition\nand our perception from\na place of interoception\nand focusing on our peripersonal space.\nThat space within us and\nimmediately around us\nand on the things that are\nimmediately accessible to us.\nThat we can shift from that mode\nto this mode of exteroception\nof focusing on things outside\nthe confines of our skin\nand that are beyond our reach,\nthat are literally goal directed behaviors\nand goal directed thoughts.\nAnd this is something that in the past,\nI have talked about a little bit\nand I've talked about something\ncalled, space-time bridging.\nAnd we haven't talked too much\nabout the time domain of\nthe visual system today.\nBut space-time bridging, is simply a way\nof using one's visual system\nto focus on the peripersonal\nspace and interoception.\nAnd then gradually in a deliberate way,\nstepping one's focus into\nthe extra personal space\nand then back to the peripersonal space\nin a way that gives you a lot\nof flexibility and control\nover that ability in your daily life.\nSo, I'm going to first describe the tool,\nand then I will explain more\nabout the underlying science\nand the underlying mechanism.\nHere's how you would do this.\nYou could do this indoors or outdoors,\nalthough, ideally, you\nwould do it in a location\nwhere you could view a horizon.\nIt could be through a window\nor ideally outdoors, without a window.\nIt could be done anytime of day.\nAt night, it might be a\nlittle more challenging,\nbut it goes the following way.\nWhat you first do, is you\nwould close your eyes,\nthis could be done sitting or standing.\nBut you would close your eyes\nand you would focus as\nmuch of your attention,\nincluding your visual attention\non your inner landscape,\non your interoception.\nSo that would be your\nbreathing, your heart rate,\nmaybe even the surface of your skin,\nbut really focusing internally.\nNow, how can you focus your\nvisual attention internally,\nif your eyes are closed?\nWell, you do that by imagining\nyour inner landscape.\nSo you don't have to\nimagine your heart beating\nand so forth.\nBut what you're trying to\ndo is eliminate perception\nof the outside world.\nYou're eliminating exteroception\nand you're focusing all of\nyour cognitive attention\nand your perceptual attention\non what you're experiencing\nwithin the confines of your skin\nor at the level of the\nsurface of your skin\nand inside your body.\nAnd you would do that for a duration\nof approximately three slow breaths.\nSo close your eyes.\nYou do breath one, breath\ntwo and breath three,\nconcentrating all your attention\non your internal landscape.\nThen you would open your eyes\nand you would focus your visual attention\non some area on the surface of your body.\nSo for me, the way that\nI typically do this,\nwill be to focus on,\nsay the palm of my hand.\nSo I'll focus my visual\nattention on the palm of my hand.\nAnd I then do three breaths again,\nfocusing on my internal state,\nbut now I'm splitting out a little bit\nof my attention from\ninteroception to exteroception.\nI'm focusing on something outside me,\nthe ratio or the split of\nattention is about 90, 10,\nabout 90% of my attention\nis focused internally,\nbut I'm also focusing some\nof my attention externally.\nMost people can do this pretty easily.\nThen, there's a third,\nwhat I call, station.\nI now move my visual\nattention to outside my body,\nto some location in the room,\nor if I'm outside in the\nexternal environment,\nsomething in the range\nof five to 15 feet away.\nAnd I'm trying to move 90% of my attention\nto that external object.\nSo now I'm really biasing my\nperception and my attention\ntowards exteroception.\nAs I breathe, I'm paying\nattention to those three breaths,\nso that's why there's still 10%,\nthat's focused on my internal landscape\nbecause I want to pay attention\nto those three breasts.\nBut I'm focusing as much of my attention,\noutside of myself,\nmaintaining just a little bit\non my internal state,\nso I can measure the cadence\nof those three breaths.\nThen I move my visual attention\nto yet another station,\nwhich is further away,\ntypically, a horizon\nor something as far off in the distance,\nas I can possibly see.\nAgain for the duration of three breaths.\nAnd at that point, I'm trying\nmy very best to move 99,\nif not 100% of my attention\nto that external location.\nAnd then, what I typically will do,\nis I will try and expand both my vision\nand my cognition to a much broader sphere.\nThis is that, magnocellular vision\nthat we talked about before,\nwhere I'm not focusing\non a particular location on the horizon.\nI'm trying to dilate the\naperture of my field of view,\nso I can see as much\nof the visual landscape\nas I'm in as possible.\nIf you're in an internal, excuse me,\nif you're in indoors,\nthen that might be the ceiling, the walls\nand the floor of the\nenvironment you're in.\nIf you're outdoors, it would\nbe to expand your visual focus\nas broadly as you possibly can.\nAgain, for the duration of three breaths,\nthen I would return immediately\nto my internal landscape.\nI would close my eyes\nand I would do three more\nbreasts focusing entirely\non my interoception, on\nmy internal landscape\nor what we called before,\nmy peripersonal space.\nAnd I would then repeat that,\nperipersonal space, 100%,\nfocus on my hand, 90%,\n10% on my peripersonal space\nor my internal landscape.\nStepping out to another location\nwhere it's mostly exteroception,\nmaybe a little bit of\nrecognition of my internal state,\nthen to the horizon,\nthen to this broader visual\nsphere, then back into my body.\nAnd I would work through\neach of those stations,\nmaybe two or three times.\nThe entire thing takes about\n90 seconds to three minutes,\ndepending on how many breaths you do.\nI said three,\nbut you could do one or 10.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nOr, it's also going to depend on,\nfor instance, how slowly your breathing.\n'Cause your breathing might be faster\nthan mine or vice versa.\nWhat is all of this doing?\nWhy do I call this space-time bridging?\nAnd why is this useful for goal setting?\nThe reason I call it space-time bridging,\nis that the visual system,\nis not just about analyzing space.\nIt's actually how we batch time.\nIt's how we carve up time.\nAnd the simple way to state this is that,\nwhen we focus our visual attention\non a very narrow point,\nthat's close to our body\nand our immediate experience.\nWe tend to slice up time, very finely.\nWe're focused on our breathing.\nWe're focused on our heartbeats.\nIn fact, our breathing\nand our internal landscape\nand our heartbeats\nbecome the sort of\nseconds hand, if you will\non our experience.\nWe are carving up time,\naccording to our immediate\nphysiological experience.\nWhereas when we focus our visual\nattention outside our body,\nnot only do we engage that exteroceptive,\nextra personal space system,\nand we start to engage\nthe dopamine system,\nthe goal-directed system,\nbut we also start\nbatching time differently.\nWhen we focus our visual system\ninto a broader sphere\nof space or into a space\nbeyond the confines of our skin,\nwe start carving up time,\nour frame rate changes.\nNow this is useful in the\ncontext of goal setting,\ngoal assessment and goal pursuit.\nBecause with the exception of\na very few isolated examples,\nalmost all goals, involve\nsetting some goal,\nthat's off in the future,\nand then carving up the time between now\nand the achievement of\nthat goal into milestones,\nthat range in duration.\nAnd the rewards, even if we try\nand just make them every week,\nare going to come at\nsome unexpected intervals\nand that's actually can be helpful\nfor reinforcing behavior,\nintermittent reward.\nThat's intermittent\nand random is the most effective\nreward schedule we know,\nbut the problem is always,\nhow do we keep our cognition\nin line with the long-term goal\nwhile also being focused\non these more immediate goals?\nAnd so this particular practice,\nthat I call space-time bridging,\nbut we could give it a different name.\nI'm sure there are better names.\nMaybe you can suggest some\nin the comment section on YouTube,\nthat are more accurate\nor map to it better.\nBut this behavior or this practice rather,\nis teaching us to use our visual system\nand thereby our cognitive system\nand thereby our reward systems,\nto orient to different locations in space\nand therefore different locations in time.\nAnd that is the essence\nof goal directed behavior.\nThat is the essence of setting a goal.\nIt's about thinking about what you want.\nThen it's about setting milestones\nthat are intermediate to that goal.\nThen it's about assessing whether\nor not you're reaching those milestones.\nAnd then, it's of course\nabout updating your goals,\nif you need to update your goals.\nAll of that is an enormously\nconfusing batch of challenges,\nif you think about it all at once,\nbut if you break it down\ninto these elements,\nthat the visual system can help you find\nand move towards those milestones.\nI think there's ample\nevidence to support that\nand that your control\nover your visual system,\nis indeed yours,\nthat you can deliberately set\nit to different locations.\nAnd then you make a practice\nof stepping through\nthese different stations\non a regular basis.\nAgain, I do this each morning.\nI do this once a day.\nRarely have I done it twice a day.\nRarely have I missed a day.\nBut by doing that, you\ncan be very effective\nin teaching the systems of your brain\nthat are related to\ngoal setting and reward,\nto map to different timeframes.\nSo, I found this to be a\nvery effective protocol,\nthe Balcetis work has mainly focused\non visual tools that\nare of a single horizon.\nHere I'm talking about multiple\nwhat I called stations or horizons.\nBut what's very clear, is\nthat an ability to move\nfrom different visual stations\nand to do that in a deliberate way\nin a focused and conscious way.\nClearly maps to an ability,\nto conceive of different goals\nover different periods of time.\nAnd I do believe can be greatly beneficial\nin allowing one to set particular goals\nand then move through the\nmilestones to those goals\nand to constantly update one's pursuit\nand reward in reaching those milestones\nand eventually, the overall goal.\nPer usual, I covered a\nlot of material today.\nWe talked about some of the neuroscience\nand psychology and popular understanding\nof goal seeking behavior.\nHow to assess goals, et cetera.\nTalked about the beautiful\nwork of Emily Balcetis\nat New York University\nand her work on the use\nof the visual system,\nto better achieve goals.\nAnd indeed things like visualization\nand why forecasting failure\ncan be more effective\nthan forecasting success\nas counter intuitive as that might seem.\nThat's what the data point to.\nAnd we talked about the importance\nof setting concrete plans\nand really what that means.\nAnd what intervals at\nwhich to assess progress.\nAnd what intervals at\nwhich to assess reward\nand how the dopamine system is involved.\nAnd in addition, I described this practice\nthat one can incorporate as a daily\nor semi-daily practice of\nso-called, space-time bridging\nof using the visual system\nand your ability to deliberately\nstep your visual system\nfrom stations that are within your body.\nSo-called peripersonal or\ninteroceptive space out\ninto the world further and further.\nAnd then back again in sequence\nas a way to harness and cultivate\nand build up these\nsystems that link vision,\nspace, time, reward systems and so forth.\nUltimately, as you set out\nto accomplish your goals,\nthere are going to be\na number of basic steps\nthat everyone will have to follow.\nYou have to clearly identify,\nwhat the long arching ultimate goal is.\nYou have to identify what\nthe milestones will be.\nYou might not know all\nof them at the outset,\nbut you ought to have some idea\nabout the intervals at which you are going\nto set those milestones\nand set your reward schedule\nfor assessing progress\nin route to those milestones\nin your ultimate goal.\nMy hope is that you'll be able\nto incorporate these

today's episode and\nin previous episodes\nof the \"Huberman Lab Podcast\",\nwe talked about supplements,\nwhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people drive tremendous\nbenefit from them.\nFor things like sleep\nand focus and so forth.\nIt's really important that if\nyou're going to take supplements,\nthat they be of the\nabsolute highest quality.\nFor that reason, we\npartner Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E\nbecause Thorne supplements,\nhave the highest levels of stringency\nwith respect to the\ningredients they include\nand the precision of the amounts\nof the ingredients they\ninclude in their products.\nIf you want to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman.\nAnd you can see the\nsupplements that I take\nand get 20% off any of those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate further\ninto the Thorne site\nthrough thorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already
