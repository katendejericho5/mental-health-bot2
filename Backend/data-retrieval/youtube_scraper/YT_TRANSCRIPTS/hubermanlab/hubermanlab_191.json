    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman.\nDr. Jack Feldman\nis a distinguished\nProfessor of Neurobiology\nat the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles.\nHe is known for his pioneering work\non the neuroscience of breathing.\nWe are all familiar with breathing\nand how essential breathing is to life.\nWe require oxygen, and\nit is only by breathing\nthat we can bring oxygen to all the cells\nof our brain and body.\nHowever, as the work from Dr. Feldman\nand colleagues tells us,\nbreathing is also fundamental\nto organ health and function\nat an enormous number of other levels.\nIn fact, how we breathe,\nincluding how often we breathe,\nthe depth of our breathing and the ratio\nof inhales to exhales actually\npredicts how focused we are,\nhow easily we get into sleep,\nhow easily we can exit from sleep.\nDr. Feldman gets credit for the discovery\nof the two major brain\ncenters that control\nthe different patterns of breathing.\nToday, you'll learn\nabout those brain centers\nand the patterns of\nbreathing they control,\nand how those different\npatterns of breathing influence\nall aspects of your\nmental and physical life.\nWhat's especially wonderful\nabout Dr. Feldman and his work\nis that it not only points\nto the critical role\nof respiration in disease,\nin health and in daily life,\nbut he's also a practitioner.\nHe understands how to\nleverage particular aspects\nof the breathing process\nin order to bias the brain\nto be in particular states\nthat can benefit us all.\nWhether or not you are a person\nwho already practices breathwork,\nor whether or not you're somebody\nwho simply breathes to stay alive,\nby the end of today's discussion\nyou're going to understand\na tremendous amount\nabout how the breathing system works\nand how you can leverage\nthat breathing system\ntoward particular goals in your life.\nDr. Feldman shares with us\nhis own particular breathing\nprotocols that he uses,\nand he suggests different\navenues for exploring respiration\nin ways that can allow you, for instance,\nto be more focused for work,\nto disengage from work\nand high stress endeavors\nto calm down quickly.\nAnd indeed, he explains\nnot only how to do that,\nbut all the underlying science\nin ways that will allow\nyou to customize your own\nprotocols for your needs.\nAll the guests that we bring\non The Huberman Lab Podcast\nare considered at the\nvery top of their fields.\nToday's guest, Dr. Feldman,\nis not only at the top of his\nfield, he founded the field.\nPrior to his coming into neuroscience\nfrom the field of physics,\nthere really wasn't much information\nabout how the brain controls breathing.\nThere was a little bit of information,\nbut we can really credit Dr. Feldman\nand his laboratory for identifying\nthe particular brain areas\nthat control different\npatterns of breathing\nand how that information can\nbe leveraged towards health,\nhigh performance and\nfor combating disease.\nSo, today's conversation you're going\nto learn a tremendous amount\nfrom the top researcher in this field.\nIt's a really wonderful\nand special opportunity\nto be able to his knowledge with you,\nand I know that you're not\nonly going to enjoy it,\nbut you are going to\nlearn a tremendous amount.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis as a company that makes nootropics.\nNow, I've talked before on\nthe podcast and elsewhere\nabout the fact that I don't\nreally like the term nootropics,\nwhich means smart drugs,\nbecause smart means many different things\nin many different contexts.\nYou've got creativity, you've got focus,\nyou've got task switching.\nSo, the idea that there will\nbe one pill or one formula\nthat could make us smarter and better\nat all those things at once,\njust doesn't stand up to logic.\nIn fact, different chemicals\nand different brain systems underlie\nour ability to be creative\nor our ability to task switch\nor to be focused.\nAnd that's the basis of Thesis.\nThesis as a company that\nmakes targeted nootropics\nfor specific outcomes.\nIn other words, specific\nnootropics to get your brain\ninto states that are ideal\nfor what you're trying to accomplish.\nThesis uses very high quality ingredients,\nmany of which I've talked\nabout before on the podcast,\nsuch as DHA, Gingko biloba,\nand phosphatidylserine.\nI talked about those in the ADHD podcast.\nThose are some of the ingredients\nin their so-called Logic formula.\nThere's a lot of research\nshowing that Gingko biloba\ncan be very helpful for\nincreasing levels of focus,\nand even for people with ADHD.\nHowever, I can't take it.\nWhen I take it, I get really bad headaches\nand I know some people who do\nand some people who don't get headaches\nwhen they take Gingko biloba.\nThis is a great example\nof why nootropics need\nto be personalized to the individual.\nThesis gives you the ability\nto try different blends\nover the course of a month\nand discover which\nnootropic formulas work best\nfor your unique brain\nchemistry and genetics,\nand which ones are best for\nparticular circumstances.\nSo, they have a formulation for instance,\nwhich is Motivation.\nThey have another formulation,\nwhich has Clarity.\nThey've got another\nformulation, which is Logic.\nAnd each of these is\nformulated specifically to you\nand formulated to a specific\nend point or goal state of mind\nfor your particular work.\nSo as a consequence, the\nformulations that you arrive at\nwill have a very high probability\nof giving you the results that you want.\nIn addition to that detailed\nlevel of personalization,\nThesis takes a step further\nby offering free consultations\nwith a brain coach to help\nyou optimize your experience,\nand dial in your favorite\nand best formulas.\nI've been using Thesis for\nclose to six months now,\nand I can confidently say\nthat their nootropics have been\na total game changer for me.\nMy favorite of the formulations\nis their Motivation formula\nthat they've tailored to me.\nWhen I use that formula,\nI have very clear state of\nmind, I have even energy,\nand I use that early in the\nday until the early afternoon\nto get the bulk of my\nmost important work done.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman,\ntake a three minute quiz and Thesis\nwill send you four different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman\nat checkout to get 10%\noff your first order.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens\nis an all-in-one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink.\nI've been using Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nis that it covers all of my vitamin,\nmineral and probiotic foundational needs.\nThere's now a wealth of data showing\nthat not only do we need\nvitamins and minerals,\nbut we also need to have\na healthy gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome is a\nset of nerve connections\nthat link the microbiota,\nliterally microbacteria\nthat live in our guts\nand that are healthy for\nus with our brain function.\nAnd our brain is also talking to our gut\nin a bi-directional way.\nAnd that conversation\nis vital for metabolism,\nfor the endocrine system,\nmeaning the hormonal system\nand for overall mood and cognition.\nThere's just so much data\nnow pointing to the fact\nthat we need a healthy gut microbiome\nand a healthy brain gut\naxis as it's called.\nBy taking Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day,\nI can get the vitamins and minerals\nand the probiotics needed\nfor all those systems\nto function optimally.\nAnd again, it tastes\ngreat, it's great for me.\nIn fact, if people ask me,\n\"What's the one supplement\nthat I should take,\"\nand they can only take one supplement,\nI recommend Athletic Greens for\nall the reasons I mentioned.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey're giving you five free travel packs,\nwhich are these little\ntravel packs to make it easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road\nor in the car or on the plane, et cetera,\nand a year supply of Vitamin D3+K2.\nThere is also a wealth of evidence showing\nthat Vitamin D3 is vital\nto our overall health,\nand K2 is important for\ncardiovascular health\nand other systems as well.\nMost of us are not getting\nenough vitamin D3 or K2,\neven if we're getting some sunshine.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou get the five free travel packs,\na year supply of Vitamin D3+K2.\nAthleticgreens.com/huberman\nis where you go\nto claim that special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation\napp that's supported\nby 25 published studies and benefits\nfrom over 600,000 five-star reviews.\nI've long been a believer in meditating.\nThere is so much data\nnow pointing to the fact\nthat regular meditation leads\nto reduced stress levels,\nheightened levels of focus,\nbetter task switching,\nand cognitive ability.\nIt just goes on and on.\nI mean, there are literally thousands\nof peer reviewed studies now\nin quality journals pointing\nto the benefits of having a\nregular meditation practice.\nThe problem with meditation\nis many people, including myself,\nhave struggled with\nsticking to that practice.\nWith Headspace, it makes\nit very easy to start\nand continue a meditation protocol.\nThe reason for that is\nthey have meditations\nthat are of different\nlengths and different styles\nso you don't get bored of meditation.\nAnd even if you just have five minutes,\nthere are five minute meditations.\nIf you've got 20 minutes,\nwhich would be even better,\nthere are 20 minute meditations.\nEver since I started using Headspace,\nI've been consistent about my meditation.\nI do meditation anywhere from\nfive to seven times a week\nin my best weeks, and\nsometimes that's drops to three\nand then I find with Headspace,\nI can quickly get back to\ndoing meditation every day\nbecause of the huge variety\nof great meditations that they have.\nIf you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou can get a free one month trial\nwith Headspace's full\nlibrary of meditations\nfor every situation.\nThat's the best deal offered\nby Headspace right now.\nSo again, if you're interested,\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nOne quick mention before we dive\ninto the conversation with Dr. Feldman.\nDuring today's episode,\nwe discuss a lot of breathwork practices\nand by the end of the episode,\nall those will be accessible to you.\nHowever, I'm aware that there are a number\nof people out there that\nwant to go even further\ninto the science and\npractical tools of breathwork.\nAnd for that reason, I want\nto mention a resource to you.\nThere is a cost associated\nwith this resource,\nbut it's a terrific platform\nfor learning about breathwork practices\nand for building a number\nof different routines\nthat you can do, or that you could teach.\nIt's called Our Breathwork Collective.\nI'm not associated with\nthe Breathwork Collective,\nbut Dr. Feldman is an advisor to the group\nand they offer daily live\nguided breathing sessions\nand an on-demand library\nthat you can practice any time\nfree workshops on breathwork.\nAnd these are really developed\nby experts in the field,\nincluding Dr. Feldman.\nSo, as I mentioned, I'm not\non their advisory board,\nbut I do know them and their work\nand it is of the utmost quality.\nSo anyone wanting to\nlearn or teach breathwork\ncould really benefit from\nthis course, I believe.\nIf you'd like to learn more,\nyou can click on the\nlink in the show notes\nor visit ourbreathcollective.com/huberman,\nand use the code Huberman at checkout.\nAnd if you do that,\nthey're offering you\n$10 off the first month.\nAgain, it's\nourbreathcollective.com/huberman\nto access the Our Breath Collective.\nAnd now for my conversation\nwith Dr. Jack Feldman.\nThanks for joining me today.\n- It's a pleasure to be here, Andrew.\n- Yeah, it's been a long time coming.\nYou're my go-to source for\nall things respiration.\nI mean, I breathe on my own,\nbut when I want to\nunderstand how I breathe\nand how the brain and breathing interact,\nyou're the person I call.\n- Well, I'll do my best.\nAs you know, there's a lot\nthat we don't understand,\nwhich still keeps me employed and engaged,\nbut we do know a lot.\n- Why don't we start off by just talking\nabout what's involved\nin generating breath.\nAnd if you would, could\nyou comment on some\nof the mechanisms for rhythmic breathing\nversus non rhythmic breathing?\n- Okay, so on the mechanical side,\nwhich is obvious to everyone,\nwe want to have air flow in, inhale,\nand we need to have air flow out\nand the reason we need to do this\nis because for body\nmetabolism, we need oxygen.\nAnd when oxygen is utilized through\nthe aerobic metabolic process,\nwe produce carbon dioxide.\nAnd so, we have to get\nrid of the carbon dioxide\nthat we produce in particular\nbecause the carbon dioxide affects\nthe acid base balance\nof the blood, the pH,\nand all living cells are very sensitive\nto what the pH value is,\nso your body is very interested\nin regulating that pH.\nSo we have to have enough oxygen\nfor our normal metabolism,\nand we have to get rid of\nthe CO2 that we produce.\nSo, how do we generate this air flow?\nWell, the air comes into the lungs.\nWe have to expand the lungs\nand as the lungs expand,\nbasically, it's like a balloon\nthat you would pull apart.\nThe pressure inside that balloon drops\nand the air will flow into the balloon.\nSo we expand, put pressure on\nthe lungs to pull it apart,\nthat lowers the pressure in\nthe air sacks called alveoli\nand air will flow in because\npressure outside the body\nis higher than pressure inside the body\nwhen you're doing this\nexpansion, when you're inhaling.\nWhat produces that?\nWell, the principle\nmuscle is the diaphragm,\nwhich is sitting inside the\nbody just below the lung,\nand when you want to inhale,\nyou basically contract the\ndiaphragm and it pulls it down.\nAnd as it pulls it down,\nit's inserting pressure\nforces on the lung,\nthe lung wants to expand.\nAt the same time, the rib cage\nis going to rotate up and out,\nand therefore expanding the\ncavity, the thoracic cavity.\nAt the end of inspiration,\nunder normal conditions\nwhen you're aggressed,\nyou just relax and it's\nlike pulling on a spring.\nYou pull down a spring\nand you let go and relax.\nSo, you inhale and you exhale.\nInhale, relax, and exhale.\n- So, the exhale is passive?\n- At rest it's passive.\nWe'll get into what happens\nwhen you need to increase\nthe amount of air you're bringing in\nbecause your ventilation,\nyour metabolism goes up\nlike during exercise.\nNow the muscles themselves,\nskeletal muscles don't do anything unless\nthe nervous system tells\nthem to do something.\nAnd when the nervous system tells\nthem to do something, they contract.\nSo, there are specialized\nneurons in the spinal cord,\nand then above the spinal cord,\nthe region called the brainstem,\nwhich go to respiratory muscles,\nin particular for\ninspiration in the diaphragm\nand the external intercostal\nmuscles in the rib cage.\nAnd they contract.\nSo, these respiratory muscles\nthese inspiratory muscles\nbecome active and they become\nactive for a period of time,\nthen they become silent and\nwhen they become silent,\nthe muscles then relax back to\ntheir original resting level.\nWhere does that activity in these neurons\nthat innovate the muscle,\nwhich are called motor neurons,\nwhere does that originate?\nWell, this was a question\nthat's been bandied around\nfor thousands of years,\nand when I was a beginning\nassistant professor,\nit was fairly high priority for me\nto try and figure that out,\nbecause I wanted to understand\nwhere this rhythm of\nbreathing was coming from\nand you couldn't know\nwhere it was coming from\nuntil you knew where it was coming from.\nAnd I didn't phrase that properly.\nYou couldn't understand\nhow it was being done\nuntil you know where to look.\nSo, we did a lot of experiments,\nwhich I can go into\ndetail and finally found,\nthere was a region in the brainstem,\nthat's once again this region\nsort of above the spinal cord,\nwhich was critical for\ngenerating this rhythm.\nIt's called the pre-Botzinger complex.\nAnd we can talk about how that was named.\nThis small site, which contains in humans,\na few thousand neurons,\nit's located on either\nside and works in tandem\nand every breath begins with neurons\nin this region beginning to be active,\nand those neurons then connect ultimately\nto these motor neurons\ngoing to the diaphragm\nand to the external\nintercostals causing them\nto be active and causing\nthis inspiratory effort.\nWhen the neurons in the\npre-Botzinger complex finish\ntheir burst of activity,\nthen inspiration stops and then you begin\nto exhale because of this passive recoil\nof the lung and rib cage.\n- Could I just briefly\ninterrupt you to ask\na few quick questions\n- Of course.\n- before we move forward in\nthis very informative answer.\nThe two questions are,\nis there anything known\nabout the activation\nof the diaphragm and\nthe intercostal muscles\nbetween the ribs as it relates\nto nose versus mouth breathing,\nor are they activated\nin the equivalent way,\nregardless of whether or not someone\nis breathing through their nose or mouth?\n- I don't think we fully\nhave the answer to that.\nClearly there are differences\nbetween nasal and mouth breathing.\nAt rest the tendency is\nto do nasal breathing\nbecause the air flows that are necessary\nfor normal breathing as easily managed\nby passing through the nasal cavities.\nHowever, when your\nventilation needs to increase\nlike during exercise, you\nneed to move more air,\nyou do that through your\nmouth because the airways\nare much larger then,\nand therefore you can move much more air,\nbut at the level of the\nintercostals and the diaphragm,\ntheir contraction is not,\nis almost agnostic to whether or not\nthe nose and mouth are open.\n- Okay, so if I understand correctly,\nthere's no reason to suspect\nthat there are particular,\nperhaps even non\noverlapping sets of neurons\nin pre-Botzinger area of the brainstem\nthat triggered nasal versus mouth inhales?\n- No, I would say that it's not\nthat the pre-Botzinger\ncomplex is not concerned\nand cannot influence that,\nbut it does not appear as\nif there's any modulation\nof whether or not it's where\nthe air is coming from,\nwhether it's coming through\nyour nasal passages or through your mouth.\n- Great. Thank you.\nAnd then the other question I have\nis that these intercostal muscles\nbetween the ribs then\nmove the ribs up and out\nif I understand correctly,\nand the diaphragm,\nare those skeletal or\nas the Brits would say,\nskeletal muscles or smooth muscles?\nWhat type of muscle are\nwe talking about here?\n- As I said earlier, these are skeletal,\nI didn't say there was skeletal muscles,\nbut they're muscles that need neural input\nin order to move.\nYou talked about smooth muscles.\nThey are specialized muscles like we have\nin the gut and in the heart,\nand these are muscles that are capable\nof actually contracting\nand relaxing on their own.\nSo, the heart beats,\nit doesn't need neural\ninput in order to beat.\nThe neural inputs modulate the strength\nof it and the frequency,\nbut they beat on their own.\nThe skeletal muscles involved\nin breathing need neural input.\nNow, there are smooth muscles\nthat have an influence on breathing,\nand these are muscles that\nare lining the airways.\nAnd so, the airways have smooth muscle\nand when they become activated,\nthe smooth muscle can contract or relax,\nand when they contract inappropriately\nis when you have problems\nbreathing like in asthma.\nAsthma is a condition\nwhere you get inappropriate constriction\nof the smooth muscles of the airways.\n- So, there's no reason\nto think that in asthma\nthat the pre-Botzinger or\nthese other neuronal centers\nin the brain that activate breathing,\nthat they are involved or\ncausal for things like asthma?\n- As of now, I would say the\npreponderance of evidence\nis that it's not involved,\nbut we've not really\nfully investigated that.\n- Thank you.\nSorry to break your flow,\nbut I was terribly\ninterested in knowing answers\nto those questions and you\nprovided them, so thank you.\n- Now, remind me again, where I was in my-\n- We were just landing in pre-Botzinger\nand we will return to the naming\nof pre-Botzinger because it's a wonderful\nand important story really,\nthat I think people should be aware of.\nBut maybe you could march\nus through the brain centers\nthat you've discovered\nand others have worked\non as well that control breathing,\npre-Botzinger as well\nas related structures.\n- Okay.\nSo, when we discovered the pre-Botzinger,\nwe thought that it was the primary source\nof all rhythmic respiratory movements,\nboth inspiration and expiration.\nTheir notion of a single\nsource is like day or night.\nIt's like they're all coming,\nthey all have the same origin\nthat the Earth rotates\nand day follows night\nand we thought that the\npre-Botzinger complex\nwould be inhalation, exhalation.\nAnd then in a series of experiments\nwe did in the early part of 2000,\nwe discovered that there\nseemed to be another region\nwhich was dominant in\nproducing expiratory movements,\nthat is the exhalation.\nWe had made a fundamental mistake\nwith the discovery of the pre-Botzinger,\nnot taking into account\nthat at rest expiratory muscle activity\nor exhalation is passive.\nSo, if that's the case,\na group of neurons that might\ngenerate active expiration,\nthat is to contract\nthe expiratory muscles,\nlike the abdominal muscles\nor the internal intercostals\nare just silent.\nWe just thought it wasn't,\nthe air was coming from one place,\nbut we got evidence that in fact,\nit may have been coming\nfrom another place.\nAnd following up on these experiments,\nwe discovered that there\nwas a second oscillator\nand that oscillator is involved\nin generating what we\ncall active expiration.\nThat is this act of-\n- If I go [exhales].\n- Yeah [exhales], or when\nyou begin to exercise,\nyou have to go [panting], and\nactually move that air out.\nThis group of cells,\nwhich is silent at rest\nsuddenly becomes active\nto drive those muscles,\nand it appears that it's an\nindependent oscillator when-\n- Maybe you could just clarify\nfor people what an oscillator is.\n- Okay, an oscillator is\nsomething that goes in a cycle.\nSo, you can have a pendulum\nas an oscillator going back and forth.\nThe Earth is an oscillator\nbecause it goes around\nand it's day and night.\n- Some people's moods are oscillating.\n- Oscillating.\nAnd it depends how regular they are.\nYou can have oscillators\nthat are highly regular\nor that are in a watch,\nor you can have those that\nare sporadic or episodic.\nBreathing is one of those oscillators\nthat for life has to be\nworking continuously 24/7.\nIt starts late in the third trimester\nbecause it has to be\nworking when you're born,\nand basically works throughout\nlife and if it stops,\nif there's no intervention\nbeyond a few minutes,\nit will likely be fatal.\n- What is this second oscillator called?\n- Well, we found that in a\nregion around the facial nucleus,\nso we initially,\nwhen this region was initially identified,\nwe thought it was involved\nin sensing carbon dioxide.\nIt was what we call a\ncentral chemo receptor.\nThat is, we want to keep\ncarbon dioxide levels,\nparticularly in the brain\nat a relatively stable level\n'cause the brain is\nextraordinarily sensitive\nto changes in pH.\nIf there's a big shift in carbon dioxide\nthere'll be a big shift in brain pH,\nand that'll throw your brain,\nif I can use the technical\nterm, out of whack.\nAnd so, you want to regulate that\nand the way to regulate\nsomething in the brain\nis you have a sensor in the brain.\nAnd others basically identified\nthat the ventral surface of the brainstem,\nthat is the part of the\nbrainstem that's on this side,\nwas critical for that\nand then we identified\na structure that was near\nthe trapezoid nucleus.\nIt was not named in any of\nthese noranatomical atlases,\nso we just picked the name out of the hat\nand we called it the\nretro trapezoid nucleus.\n- I should clarify for people.\nWhen Jack is saying trapezoid,\nit doesn't mean the trapezoid muscles.\nTrapezoid refers to the\nshape of this nucleus,\nthis cluster of neurons.\nParafacial makes me think\nthat this general area\nis involved in something\nrelated to mouth or face.\nIs it an area rich with\nneurons controlling other parts\nof the face, eye blinks,\nnose twitches, lip curls, lip smacks?\n- If you go back in an evolutionary sense\nand a lot of things that\nare hard to figure out\nbegin to make sense when you look\nat the evolution of the nervous system.\nWhen control of facial muscles,\ngoing back to more primitive creatures\nbecause they had to take things\nin their mouth for eating,\nso we call that the\nface sort of developed,\nthe eyes were there, the mouth is there,\nthese nuclei, the modem that\ncontained the motor neurons,\na lot of the control\nsystems for them developed\nin the immediate vicinity.\nSo, if you think about the face,\nthere's a lot of sudden\nnuclei around there\nthat had various roles\nat various different times in evolution.\nAnd at one point in evolution,\nthe facial muscles were\nprobably very important\nin moving fluid in and out of the mouth\nand moving air in and out of the mouth,\nand so part of these\nmany different sub nuclei\nnow seems to be in mammals to be involved\nin the control of expiratory muscles.\nBut we have to remember that mammals\nare very special when\nit comes to breathing,\nbecause we're the only\nclass of vertebrates\nthat have a diaphragm.\nIf you look at amphibians and reptiles,\nthey don't have a diaphragm.\nAnd the way they breathe is\nnot by actively inspiring\nand passively expiring.\nThey breathe by actively\nexpiring and passively inspiring\nbecause they don't have a\npowerful inspiratory muscle.\nAnd somewhere along the line,\nthe diaphragm developed,\nand there are lots of theories\nabout how it developed.\nI don't think it's particularly clear.\nThere was something that\nyou can find in alligators\nand lizards that could\nhave turned into a muscle\nthat was the diaphragm.\nThe amazing thing about the diaphragm\nis that it's mechanically\nextremely efficient.\nAnd what do I mean by that?\nWell, if you look at how oxygen gets\nfrom outside the body\ninto the bloodstream,\nthe critical passage is across\nthe membrane in the lung.\nIt's called the alveolar\ncapillary membrane.\nThe alveolus is part of the lung\nand the blood runs through capillaries,\nwhich are the smallest tubes\nin the circulatory system.\nAnd at that point,\noxygen can go from the air\nfilled alveolus into the blood.\n- Which is amazing.\nI find that amazing,\neven though it's just purely mechanical,\nthe idea we had these\nlittle sacks in our lungs,\nwe inhale and the air\ngoes in and literally\nthe oxygen can pass into the bloodstream-\n- Passes into the bloodstream.\nBut the rate of which\nit passes will depend\non the characteristics of the membrane,\nwhat the distance is between the alveolus\nand the blood vessel, the capillary.\nBut the key element is the surface area.\nThe bigger the surface area,\nthe more oxygen that can pass through,\nit's entirely a passive process.\nThere's no magic about\nmaking oxygen go in.\nNow, how do you get a pack,\na large surface area in a small chest?\nWell, you start out with one\ntube, which is the trachea,\nthe trachea expands.\nNow you have two tubes.\nThen you have four tubes\nand it keeps branching.\nAt some point, at the\nend of those branches,\nyou put a little sphere,\nwhich is an alveolus,\nand that determines what the\nsurface area is going to be.\nNow, you then have a mechanical problem.\nYou have the surface area,\nyou have to be able to pull it apart.\nSo, imagine you have a little\nsquare of elastic membrane,\nit doesn't take a lot of\nforce to pull it apart,\nbut now if you increase it by 50 times,\nyou need a lot more\nforce to pull it apart.\nSo, amphibians who were breathing,\nnot by compressing the lungs\nand then just passively expanding it\nweren't able to generate a lot of force,\nso they have relatively few branches.\nSo, if you look at the surface area\nthat they pack in their lungs\nrelative to their body size,\nit's not very impressive.\nWhereas when you get to mammals,\nthe amount of branching that you have\nis you have four to 500,000,000 alveoli.\n- If we were to take\nthose four to 5,000,000-\n- 100,000,000, four to 500,000,000.\n- 100,000,000, excuse me,\nand lay those out flat,\nwhat sort of surface area\nare we talking about?\n- About 70 square meters,\nwhich is about a third the\nsize of a tennis court.\n- Wow.\n- So you have a membrane inside of you\na third the size of a tennis court\nthat you actually have\nto expand every breath.\nAnd you do that without\nexerting much of a,\nyou don't feel it,\nand that's because you\nhave this amazing muscle,\nthe diaphragm, which\nbecause of its positioning\njust by moving two thirds of an inch down\nis able to expand that membrane enough\nto move air into the lungs.\nNow, the at rest,\n- Wow.\n- the volume of air in your lungs\nis about two and a half liters.\nDo we need to convert that to quartz?\n- No.\n- Right, so about two and a half liters.\nWhen you take a breath,\nyou're taking another 500\nmilliliters or half a liter.\nThat's the size maybe of my fist.\nSo, you're increasing the volume by 20%,\nbut you're doing that by pulling\non this 70 square meter membrane.\nBut that's enough to\nbring enough fresh air\ninto the lung to mix in with\nthe air that's already there,\nthat the oxygen levels in your bloodstream\ngoes from a partial pressure of oxygen,\nwhich is 40 millimeters of mercury\nto 100 millimeters of mercury.\nSo, that's a huge increase in oxygen\nand that's enough to\nsustain normal metabolism.\nSo, we have this amazing\nmechanical advantage\nby having a diaphragm.\n- Do you think that our brains are larger\nthan that of other mammals in part,\nbecause of the amount of oxygen\nthat we have been able\nto bring into our system?\n- I would say a key step in the ability\nto develop a large brain\nthat has a continuous demand\nfor oxygen is the diaphragm.\nWithout a diaphragm, you're an amphibian,\nand there's another solution\nto increasing oxygen uptake\nwhich is the way birds breathe,\nbut birds have other limitations\nand they still can't get\nbrains as big as mammals have.\nSo, the brain utilizes\nmaybe 20% of all the oxygen\nthat we intake and it\nneeds to continuously.\nThe brain doesn't want to be neglected.\nSo, this puts certain\ndemands on breathing system.\nIn other words, you can't\nshut it down for awhile,\nwhich poses other issues.\nYou're born, and you have to mature.\nYou have the small body,\nyou have a small lung,\nyou have a very pliant rib cage,\nand now you have to develop into an adult,\nwhich has a stiffer rib cage.\nAnd so, there are changes happening\nin your brain and your body,\nwhere the neural control of breathing\nhas to change on the fly.\nIt's not like for things like vision\nwhere you have the opportunity to sleep\nand while you're sleeping,\nthe brain is capable of doing things\nthat are not easy to\ndoing during wakefulness,\nlike the construction crew\ncomes in during sleep.\nThe change in breathing has been described\nas trying to build an\nairplane while it's flying.\n- Basically what Jack is saying\nis that respiration\nscience is more complex\nand hardworking than vision science,\nwhich is a direct jab at me that some\nof you might've missed, but\nI definitely did not miss,\nand I appreciate that you\nalways take the opportunity\nlike a good New Yorker to give me a good,\nhealthy intellectual jab.\nA question related to\ndiaphragmatic breathing\nversus non diaphragmatic breathing\nbecause the way you describe it,\nthe diaphragm is always involved\nbut over the years whether it be\nfor yoga class or a breathwork thing,\nor you hear online that we should\nbe breathing with our diaphragm,\nthat rather than lifting our rib cage\nwhen we breathe [inhales] and our chest,\nthat it is \"healthier\" in air quotes\nor better somehow to have the\nbelly expand when we inhale.\nI'm not aware of any particular studies\nthat have really examined\nthe direct health\nbenefits of diaphragmatic\nversus non diaphragmatic breathing,\nbut if you don't mind\ncommenting on anything\nyou're aware of as it relates\nto diaphragmatic versus non\ndiaphragmatic breathing,\nwhether or not people tend\nto be diaphragmatic breathers\nby default, et cetera,\nthat would be, I think\ninteresting to a number of people.\n- Well, I think by default,\nwe are obligate diaphragm breathers.\nThere may be pathologies\nwhere the diaphragm\nis compromised and you\nhave to use other muscles,\nand that's a challenge.\nCertainly at rest other\nmuscles can take over,\nbut if you need to\nincrease your ventilation,\nthe diaphragm is very important.\nIt would be hard to increase\nyour ventilation otherwise.\n- Do you pay attention to whether or not\nyou are breathing in a manner\nwhere your belly goes out\na little bit as you inhale,\nbecause I can do it both ways, right?\nI can inhale [inhales], bring my belly in,\nor I can inhale [inhales], push\nmy diaphragm and belly out.\nNot the diaphragm out,\nbut and that's interesting, right?\nBecause it's a completely\ndifferent muscle set\nfor each version.\n- Well, in the context of\nthings like breath practice,\nI'm a bit agnostic about the effects\nof some of the different\npatterns are breathing.\nClearly, some are going to work\nthrough different mechanisms,\nand we can talk about that,\nbut at a certain level for example,\nwhether it's primarily diaphragm\nwhere you move your abdomen or\nnot, I am agnostic about it.\nI think that the changes\nthat breathing induces\nin emotion and cognition,\nI have different ideas\nabout what the influence is\nand I don't see that primarily as how,\nwhich particular muscles you're choosing,\nbut that just could be my own prejudice.\n- Okay.\nWe will return to that as a\ngeneral theme in a little bit.\nI want to ask you about sighing.\nOne of the many great gifts\nthat you've given us over\nthe years is an\nunderstanding of these things\nthat we call physiological sighs.\nCould you tell us about\nphysiological sighs?\nWhat's known about them,\nwhat your particular interest in them is\nand what they're good for?\n- A very interesting\nand important question.\nSo, everyone has a\nsense of what a sigh is.\nWe certainly, when we're emotional,\nin some ways we're stressed,\nwe're particularly happy,\n[inhales] we'll take a little sigh.\nIt turns out that we're\nsighing all the time.\nAnd when I would ask people\nwho are not particularly knowledgeable\nthat have read my papers\nor James Nestor's book\nor listened to your podcast,\nthey're usually off by\ntwo orders of magnitude\nabout how frequently we\nsigh on the low side.\nIn other words, they say\nonce an hour, 10 times a day.\nWe sigh about every five minutes,\nand I would encourage\nanyone who finds that\nto be a unbelievable fact,\nis to lie down in a quiet room\nand just breathe normally,\njust relax, just let go,\nand just pay attention to your breathing\nand you'll find that\nevery couple of minutes,\nyou're [inhales] taking a deep\nbreath and you can't stop it.\nIt just happens.\nNow, why?\nWell, we have to go\nback to the lung again.\nThe lung has these 500,000,000 alveoli,\nand they're very tiny.\nThey're 200 microns across.\nSo, they're really, really tiny.\nAnd you can think of them as fluid filled.\nThey're fluid lined.\nAnd the reason their fluid lined\nhas to do with the esoterica\nof the mechanics of that.\nIt makes it a little easier to stretch\nthem with this fluid line,\nwhich is called surfactant.\nAnd surfactant is important\nduring development,\nit is a determining factor in the,\nwhen premature infants are born.\nIf they have not do not\nhave lung surfactant\nit makes it much more\nchallenging to take care of them\nthan after they have lung surfactant,\nwhich is sometime, if\nI remember correctly,\nin the late second, early third\ntrimester, which it appears.\nIn any case it's fluid line.\nNow, think of a balloon\nthat you would blow up,\nbut now before you blow it up,\nfill the balloon with water,\nsqueeze all the water out and now,\nwhen you squeeze all the water out\nyou notice the sides of the\nballoon stick to each other.\nWhy is that?\nWell, that's because water\nhas what's called surface tension.\nAnd when you have two\nsurfaces of water together,\nthey actually tend to stick to each other.\nNow, when you try and\nblow that balloon up,\nyou know that it,\nor you'll notice if you've\never done it before,\nthat the balloon is a\nlittle harder to inflate\nthan if we're dry on the inside.\nWhy is that?\nBecause you have to overcome\nthat surface tension.\nWell, your alveoli have\na tendency to collapse.\nThere's 500,000,000 in them.\nThey're not collapsing\nat a very high rate,\nbut it's a slow rate that's not trivial.\nAnd when an alveolus\ncollapses it no longer\ncan receive oxygen or\ntake carbon dioxide out.\nIt's sort of taken out of the equation.\nNow, if you have 500,000,000\nin them and you lose 10,\nno big deal, but if they keep collapsing,\nyou can lose a significant part\nof the surface area of your lung.\nNow, a normal breath is not\nenough to pop them open,\nbut if you take [inhales] a deep breath\nit pops them open.\n- Through nose or your mouth?\n- Doesn't matter.\n- Okay.\n- Doesn't matter.\n- Or-\n- It just increased that lung volume\n'cause you're just pulling on the lungs,\nthey'll pop open every\nabout every five minutes.\nAnd so, we're doing it every five minutes\nin order to maintain\nthe health of our lung.\nIn the early days of\nmechanical ventilation,\nwhich was used to treat polio victims\nwho had weakness of their\nrespiratory muscles,\nthey'd be put in these big steel tubes\nand the way that would work\nis that the pressure outside\nthe body would drop.\nThat would put a expansion\npressure on the lungs, excuse me,\non the rib cage.\nThe rib cage would expand and\nthen the lung would expand.\nAnd then the pressure\nwould go back to normal\nand the lung and rib cage\nwould go back to normal.\nThis was great for getting ventilation,\nbut there was a relatively\nhigh mortality rate.\nIt was a bit of a mystery.\nAnd one solution was to\njust give bigger breaths.\nThey'd give bigger breaths and\nthe mortality rate dropped,\nand it wasn't until I\nthink it was the '50s\nwhere they realized that they didn't\nhave to increase every breath to be big.\nWhat they needed to do\nwas every so often they\nto have one big breath.\nSo, you have a couple of\nminutes of normal breaths,\nand then one big breath just mimicking\nthe physiological sighs,\nand then the mortality\nrate dropped significantly.\nAnd if you see someone on a\nventilator in the hospital,\nif you watch every couple\nof minutes that you see\nthe membrane move up and down,\nevery couple of minutes\nthere'll be a super breath\nand that pops it open.\nSo, there are these mechanisms\nfor these physiological sighs.\nSo, just like with the\ncollapse of the lungs,\nwhere you need a big\npressure to pop it open,\nit's the same thing with the alveola.\nYou need a bigger pressure\nand a normal breath is not enough.\nSo, you have to take a big inhale.\n[Jack inhales]\n[Jack exhales]\nAnd what nature has done\nis instead of requiring\nus to remember to do it,\nit does it automatically.\nAnd it does it about every five minutes.\nAnd one of the questions we asked\nis how is this happening?\nWhy every five minutes?\nWhat's doing it?\nAnd we got into it through a back door.\nTypical of the way a lot\nof science gets done.\nThis is serendipitous event\nwhere you run across a paper\nand something clicks and\nyou just, you follow it up.\nSometimes you go down blind ends,\nbut this turned out to\nbe incredibly productive.\nOne of the guys in my lab was\nreading a paper about stress,\nand during stress lots of\nthings happen in the body,\none of which is that the hypothalamus,\nwhich is very reactive to\nbody state releases peptides,\nwhich are specialized molecules,\nwhich then circulate\nthroughout the brain and body,\nthat particular effects usually\nto help deal better with the stress.\nAnd one class of the\npeptides that are released\nare called Bombesin related peptides.\nAnd he also realize because\nhe was a breathing guy,\nthat when you're stressed you sigh more.\nSo we said, \"All right,\nmaybe they're related.\"\nBombesin is relatively cheap to buy.\nWe said, Let's buy some Bombesin\nand throw it in the brainstem,\nlet's see what happens.\"\nAnd one of the nice things\nabout some experiments\nthat we try to design is to fail quickly.\nSo here we had the idea,\nwe throw Bombesin in and\nthe Bombesin did nothin',\nnothing lost, maybe $50\nto buy the Bombesin.\nBut if it did something it\nmight be of some interest.\nSo, one afternoon we did the\nexperiment and he comes to me,\nhe says, I won't quote\nexactly what he said,\nbecause that might need to be censored,\nbut he said, \"Look at this.\"\nAnd it was in a rat.\nRats sigh about every two minutes.\nThey're smaller than we are\nand they need to sigh more often.\nTheir sigh rate went from 20\nto 30 per hour to 500 per hour\nwhen you put Bombesin into\nthe pre-Botzinger complex.\n- [Andrew] Amazing.\n- And the way he did\nthat is he took a very,\nvery fine glass needle\nand anesthetized a rat,\nand inserted that needle directly\ninto the pre-Botzinger complex.\nSo, it wasn't an internalized\ndelivery of the peptide.\nIt was localized in the pre-Botzinger,\nand the sigh rate went through the roof.\n- And I would add that that\nwas an important experiment\nto deliver the Bombesin\ndirectly to that site\nbecause one could have\nconcluded that the injection\nof the Bombesin increased sighing\nbecause it increased stress\nrather than directly increased sighing.\n- Amongst hundreds of other\npossible interpretations.\nSo, the precision here is very important,\nand that goes back to what I\nsaid at the very beginning,\nknowing where this is happening allows\nyou to do the proper investigations.\nIf we didn't know where\nthe inspiratory rhythm\nwas originating,\nwe've never could have\ndone this experiment.\nAnd so, then we did another experiment.\nWe said, \"Okay, what\nhappens if we take the cells\nin the pre-Botzinger that are\nresponding to the peptides?\nSo, neurons will respond to a peptide\nbecause they have specialized\nreceptors for that peptide.\nAnd not every neuron\nexpresses those receptors.\nIn the pre-Botzinger complex,\nit's probably a few\nhundred out of thousands.\nSo, we used the technique\nwe had used before,\nand this is a technique developed\nby Doug Laffey down in San Diego,\nwhere you could take a peptide\nand conjugate it with a\nmolecule called saporin.\nSaporin is a plant derived molecule,\nwhich is a cousin to ricin.\nAnd many of your listeners\nmay have heard of ricin and-\n- It's a ribosomal toxin.\n- It's very nasty.\nA single stab with an\numbrella will kill you,\nwhich is something that\nsupposedly happened\nto a Bulgarian diplomat\nby a Russian operative\non a bridge in London.\nHe got stabbed and the way ricin works\nis it goes inside a cell,\ncrosses the cell membrane,\ngoes inside the cell, kills the cell,\nthen it goes to the next\ncell and then the next cell,\nand then the next cell.\nIt's extremely dangerous.\nIn fact, it's virtually impossible\nto work on in a lab in the United States.\nThey won't let you touch it.\n- Ricin?\n- Ricin 'cause-\n- We've worked with saporin many times.\n- Saporin is safe because it\ndoesn't cross cell membranes.\nSo, you got an injection of saporin,\nit won't do anything because\nit stays outside of cells.\n- Please, nobody do that,\neven though it doesn't\ncross cell membranes,\nplease, nobody inject saporin\nwhether or not you are a\noperative or otherwise.\n- Thank you, Andrew,\nfor protecting me there.\nSo, but what Doug Laffey figured out\nis that when a ligand binds the receptor,\nthat's when a molecule\nbinds to its receptor,\nin many cases that receptor ligand complex\ngets pulled inside the cell.\nSo, it goes from the membrane\nof the cell inside the cell.\n- Sort of like you can't\ngo to the dance alone,\nbut if you're coupled\nup, you get in the door.\n- That's right.\nSo, what he figured out is he\nput saporin to the peptide,\nthe peptide binds to its\nreceptor, it gets internalized\nand then when it's inside the cell,\nsaporin does the same\nthing that ricin does.\nIt kills the cell,\nbut then it can't go into the next cell.\nSo, the only cells that get killed,\nor the more polite term ablated,\nare cells that express that receptor.\nSo, if you have a big\nconglomeration of cells,\nyou have a few thousand and only 50\nof them which express that receptor,\nthen you inject the saporin conjugated\nto the ligand for the peptide,\nand only those 50 cells die.\nSo, we took Bombesin\nconjugated the saporin,\ninject in the pre-Botzinger\ncomplex of rats,\nand it took about a couple of days\nfor the saporin to actually ablate cells.\nAnd what happened is that\nthe mice started sighing\nless and less, excuse me,\nthe rats started sighing less\nand less and less and less,\nand essentially stopped signing.\n- So, your student or postdoc, was it?\nMurdered these cells,\nand as a consequence,\nthe sighing goes away.\n- Right.\n- What was the consequence\nof eliminating sighing\non the internal state or\nthe behavior of the rats?\nDid they, in other words,\nif one can't sigh, generate\nphysiological sighs,\nwhat is the consequence on state of mind?\nYou would imagine that carbon dioxide\nwould build up more readily\nor to higher levels in the bloodstream\nand that the animals\nwould be more stressed.\nThat's a kind of logical\nextension of the way we set it up.\n- It was less benign than that.\nWhen the animals got to the point\nwhere they weren't sighing then,\nand we did not determine this,\nbut the presumption was\nthat their lung function\nsignificantly deteriorated,\nand their whole health\ndeteriorated significantly\nand we had to sacrifice them.\nSo, I can't tell you whether\nthey were stressed or not,\nbut their breathing got to\nbe significantly deteriorated\nthat we sacrificed them at that point.\nNow, we don't know whether\nthat is specifically related\nto the fact they didn't sigh\nor that there was secondary damage due\nto the fact that some cells die,\nso we never determined that.\nNow, after we did this study,\nto be candid, it wasn't a high priority\nfor us to get this out\nthe door and publish it.\nSo, it stayed on the shelf.\nAnd then I got a phone call\nfrom a graduate student\nat Stanford, Kevin Yackle,\nwho starts askin' me\nall these interesting\nquestions about breathing,\nand I'm happy to answer them\nbut at some point it concerned\nme because he was working\nfor a renowned biochemist who worked\non lung in drosophila, fruit flies,\nMark Krasnow.\n- Yeah, got my next door colleague.\n- Right.\n- Yeah.\n- And I said, \"Why are\nyou asking me this?\"\nAnd he said, \"I was an\nundergraduate at UCLA\nand you gave a lecture\nin my undergraduate class\nand I was curious about\nbreathing ever since.\"\nSo, that's one of those\nthings which as a professor,\nyou love to hear that actually\nit's something you really\naffected the life of a student.\n- When you birthed the competitor,\nbut you had only yourself to blame.\n- No, I don't look at\nthat as a competitor.\nI think that there's enough\ninteresting things to go on.\nI know some of our\nneuroscience colleagues say,\n\"You can work in my lab, but\nthen when you leave my lab,\nyou've got to work on\nsomething different.\"\n- No one I ever trained\nwould've said that.\nIt's open field.\nYou want to work on\nsomething, you hop in the mix.\n- And, but there are people like that,\nneuroscientists like that.\nI never felt that-\n- I hear that they're breathing apparati\nare disrupted and that\ncauses a brain dysfunction\nthat leads to the behavior\nyou just described.\nIt's actually not true,\nbut in terms of the-\n- So-\n- So, before we talk\nabout the beautiful story\nwith Yackle and Krasnow and Feldman Lab,\nI want to just make\nsure that I understand.\nSo, if physiological sighs don't happen,\nbasically breathing overall suffers?\n- Well, that would go\nback to the observations\nin polio victims and these iron lungs\nwhere the principal deficit\nwas there was no hyperinflation\nof the lungs and many of\nthem deteriorated and died.\n- And just to stay on this one more moment\nbefore we moved to what\nyou were about to describe,\nwe hear often that people\nwill overdose on drugs\nof various kinds because\nthey stopped breathing.\nSo, barbiturates, alcohol\ncombined with barbiturates\nis a common cause of death for drug users\nand contra-indications of drugs,\nand these kinds of things.\nYou hear all the time\nabout celebrities dying\nbecause they combined\nalcohol with barbiturates.\nIs there any evidence that the sighs\nthat occurred during\nsleep or during states\nof deep, deep relaxation and sedation\nthat sighs recover the brain?\nBecause you can imagine that\nif the sighs don't happen\nas a consequence of some drug\nimpacting these brain centers,\nthat that could be one cause\nof basically asphyxiation and death.\n- If you look at the progression\nof any mammal to death,\nyou find that their breathing slows down,\na death due to natural causes,\ntheir breathing slows down,\nit will stop, and then they'll gasp.\nSo, we have the phrase\ndying gasp [inhales].\nSuper large breaths.\nThey're often described as an\nattempt to auto resuscitate,\nthat as you take that super deep breath\nand that maybe it can\nkickstart the engine again.\nWe do not know the degree\nto such things as gasp\nare really sighs that\nare particularly large.\nAnd so, if you suppress\nthe ability to gasp\nin an individual who is\nsubject to an overdose,\nthen whereas they might been able\nto re-arouse their breathing,\nif that's prevented, they\ndon't get re-aroused.\nSo, that is certainly a possibility,\nbut this has not been investigated.\nI mean, one of the things\nthat I'm interested in\nis in individuals who have diseases,\nwhich will affect pre-Botzinger complex.\nAnd there's data in Parkinson's disease\nand multiple system atrophy,\nwhich is another form of neurodegeneration\nwhere there's loss of\nneurons in pre-Botzinger.\nAnd the question is, and\nit also may happen in ALS,\nsometimes referred to\nas Lou Gehrig's disease,\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nThese individuals often die during sleep.\nWe have an idea that we have not been able\nto get anyone to test is that\npatients with Parkinson's,\npatients with MLS typically breathe\nnormally during wakefulness.\nThe disturbances that they have\nin breathing is during sleep.\nSo, Parkinson's patients at\nthe end stages of the disease\noften have significant disturbances\nin their sleep pattern,\nbut not during wakefulness.\nAnd we think that what could be happening\nis that the proximate cause\nof death is not heart failure,\nis that they become apneic.\nThey stop breathing and don't resuscitate.\nAnd that resuscitation\nmay or may not be due\nto an explicit suppression of sighs,\nbut to an overall suppression\nof the whole apparatus of\nthe pre-Botzinger complex.\n- Got it. Thank you.\nSo, Yackle calls you up.\n- So, he calls me up and\nhe's, great kid, super smart,\nand he tells me about these\nexperiments that he's doing\nwhere he's looking in a database to try\nand find out what molecules are enriched\nin regions of the brain that\nare critical for breathing.\nSo, we and others have mapped out\nthese regions in the brainstem,\nand he was looking at\none of these databases\nto see what's enriched.\nAnd I said, \"That's great.\nWill you be willing to sort\nof share our work together?\"\nHe says, \"No, my advisor\ndoesn't want me to do that.\"\nSo I said, \"Okay,\" but\nKevin's a great kid,\nand I enjoy talking to\nhim and he's a smart guy,\nand what I found in academia is that\nthe smartest people only\nwant to hire people smarter\nthan them and have the preference\nto interact with people smarter than them.\nThe faculty who are not\nat the highest level\nand at every institution,\nthere's a distribution.\nOne's above the mean,\nand those below the mean,\nthose whom below the mean\nare very threatened by that.\nAnd I saw Kevin as like a shining light,\nand I didn't care whether he\nwas going to out-compete me\nbecause whatever he did was\ngoing to help me in the field,\nso I did whatever I can to\nhelp him, to work with Kevin.\nSo, at one point I got invited\nto give grand rounds in\nneurology at Stanford.\nIt turns out an undergraduate\nstudent who had worked with me\nwas now head of the training program\nfor neurologists at\nStanford and he invited me.\nAnd at the end of my visit,\nI go to Mark Krasnow's\noffice, and Kevin is there,\nand a post-doc punctually\nwho was also working\non a project was there.\nAnd towards the end of the conversation,\nMark says to me,\n\"We found this one molecule\nwhich is highly concentrated\nin an important region for breathing.\"\nI said, \"Oh, that's great.\nWhat is it?\"\nAnd he says, \"I can't tell you\nbecause we want to work on it.\"\nSo, I'm of course I'm disappointed,\nbut I realized that the ethic\nin some areas of science or the custom\nin some areas of science\nis that until you get a publication,\nyou'll be relatively restricted\nin sharing the information.\n- Mark and I\nare going to have a chat\nwhen I come back.\n- Okay, all right.\n- Yeah.\n- Well, he may remember\nthe story differently,\nbut I said okay, and as\nI'm walking out the door,\nI remember these experiments I described\nto you about Bombesin,\nand that was the only unusual\nmolecule we're working.\nSo, the reason I'm rushing out the door\nis I have a flight to catch.\nSo, I stick my head in and I said,\n\"Is this molecule related to Bombesin?\"\nAnd then I run off, I don't\neven wait for them to reply.\nI can be up for it.\nMark calls me and he says, \"Bombesin?\nThe peptide we found\nis related to Bombesin.\nWhat does it do?\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm not telling.\"\n[Andrew laughs]\n- Oh my.\nI'm so glad I wasn't involved\nin this collaboration.\n- No, no, but that was sort\nof a tease 'cause I said,\n\"Well, let's work together on this.\"\nAnd then we worked together on this.\n- It was a prisoner's\ndilemma at that point, yeah.\nSo, Kevin Yackle is spectacular,\nhas his own lab at UCF,\nand the work that I'm\nfamiliar with from Kevin\nis worth mentioning now, or\nI'll ask you to mention it,\nwhich is this reciprocal\nrelationship between brain state,\nor we could even say\nemotional state and breathing.\nAnd I'd love to get your thoughts\non how breathing interacts\nwith other things in the brain.\nYou've beautifully described\nhow breathing controls\nthe lungs, the diaphragm,\nand the interactions between oxygen\nand carbon dioxide and so forth.\nBut as we know, when we get\nstressed, our breathing changes.\nWhen we're happy and relaxed,\nour breathing changes.\nBut also if we change our breathing,\nwe, in some sense can\nadjust our internal state.\nWhat is the relationship between\nbrain state and breathing?\nAnd if you would,\nbecause I know you have a particular love\nof one particular aspect of this,\nwhat is the relationship\nbetween brain rhythms,\noscillations if you will, and breathing?\n- This is a topic which has\nreally intrigued me over\nthe past decade.\nI would say before that I was in my silo,\njust interested about how the rhythm\nof breathing is generated,\nand didn't really pay much\nattention to this other stuff.\nFor some reason I got interested in it,\nand I think it was triggered by an article\nin \"The New York Times\" about mindfulness.\nNow, believe it or not,\nalthough I had lived in California\nfor 20 years at that time, I\nnever heard of mindfulness.\nIt's staggering how isolated\nyou can be from the real world.\nAnd I Googled it and there\nwas a mindfulness institute at UCLA,\nand they were giving\ncourses in meditation.\nSo I said, \"Oh, this is great\nbecause I can now see whether or not\nthe breathing part of\nmeditation has anything\nto do with the purported\neffects of meditation.\"\nSo I signed up for the course,\nand as I joked to you\nbefore, I had two goals.\nOne was to see whether or not\na breathing had an effect,\nand the other was to levitate\nbecause I grew up with\nall these Kung Fu things\nand all the monks could levitate\nwhen they meditated, so why not?\nWe have a motto in the lab,\nyou can't do anything interesting\nif you're afraid of failing,\nand if I fail to levitate,\nwell, at least I tried.\nAnd I should tell you now,\nI still haven't done it yet,\nbut I haven't given up yet.\n- Yet.\n- Yet. I haven't given up.\nSo, I took this course in mindfulness\nand it became apparent to me\nthat the breathing part\nwas actually critical.\nIt wasn't simply a distraction or a focus.\nThey could have had you\nmove your index finger\nto the same effect.\nReally we believed that the\nbreathing part was involved.\nNow, I'm not an unbiased\nobserver so the question is,\nhow can I demonstrate that?\nI didn't feel competent to\ndo experiments in humans,\nand I didn't feel I could design\nthe right experiments in humans,\nbut I felt maybe I can\nstudy this in rodents.\nSo we got this idea that we're going\nto teach rodents to meditate\nand that's laughable,\nbut we said, but if we can,\nthen we can actually\nstudy how this happens.\nSo, believe it or not,\nI was able to get a\nsort of a startup grant,\nan R21 from NCCIH,\nthat's the National\nComplementary Medicine Institute.\n- A wonderful institute I should mention.\nOur government puts major\ntax dollars toward studies\nof things like meditation,\nbreathwork, supplements,\nherbs, acupuncture.\nThis is I think not well-known,\nand it's an incredible thing\nthat our government does that,\nand I think it deserves a nod\nand more funding [chuckles].\n- I totally agree with you.\nI think that it's the kind\nof thing that many of us,\nincluding many scientists thinks\nis to woo woo and unsubstantiated,\nbut we're learning more and more.\nWe used to laugh at neuroimmunology,\nthat the nervous system\ndidn't have anything\nto do with the immune\nsystem and pain itself\ncan influence your immune system.\nI mean, there are all these things\nthat we're learning\nthat we use to dismiss,\nand I think there's real\nnuggets to be learned here.\nSo, they went out on a limb\nand they funded this particular project.\nAnd now I'm going to leap\nahead because for three years\nwe threw stuff up against\nthe wall that didn't work.\nAnd recently we had a major breakthrough.\nWe found a protocol by which\nwe can get mice to breathe slowly,\nawake mice to breathe slowly.\nI won't tell you.\n- Normally they don't breathe slowly.\n- No, no.\nIn other words, whatever\ntheir normal breath is,\nwe could slow it down by a factor of 10\nand they're fine doing that.\nSo, we could do that for,\nwe did that 30 minutes a\nday for four weeks, okay?\nLike a breath practice.\n- Do they levitate?\n- We haven't measured that yet [laughs].\nI would say a priority,\nwe haven't seen them floating\nto the top of that cage,\nbut we haven't weighed them.\nMaybe they weigh less.\nMaybe levitation is graded.\nAnd so, maybe if you weigh less\nit's sort of partial levitation.\nIn any case,\nwe then tested them.\nAnd we had control animals, mice,\nwhere we did everything the same,\nexcept the manipulation we made\ndid not slow down their breathing.\nSo, but they went through everything else.\nWe then put them through a\nstandard for air conditioning,\nwhich we did with my\ncolleague, Michael Fanselow,\nwho's one of the real gurus of fear.\nAnd we measured a standard\ntest is to put mice\nin a condition where they're concerned\nthey'll receive a shock and their response\nis that they freeze,\nand the measure of how fearful they are\nis how long they freeze.\nThis is well validated and\nit's way above my pay grade\nto describe the validity of\nthe test, but it's very valid.\nThe control mice had a freezing time,\nwhich was just the same as\nordinary mice would have.\nThe ones that went\nthrough our protocol\nfroze much, much less.\nAccording to Michael,\nthe degree to which they\nshowed less freezing\nwas as much as if there\nwas a major manipulation in the amygdala,\nwhich is a part of the brain\nthat's important in fear processing.\nIt's a staggering change.\nThe problem we have now is\nthe grant ran out of money,\nthe postdoc working on it left,\nand now we have to try and\npiece together everything,\nbut the data is spectacular.\n- Well, I think it's,\nI'll just pause you for a moment there\nbecause I think that the,\nyou're talking about a rodent study,\nbut I think the benefits\nof doing rodent study\nis that you can get deep into mechanism\nand for people that might think,\nwell, we've known that\nmeditation has these benefits,\nwhy do you need to get\nmechanistic science?\nI think that one thing that's important\nfor people to remember\nis that first of all,\nas many people as one might think\nare meditating out there\nor doing breathwork,\na far, far, far, far greater number\nof people are not, right?\nI mean, the majority of\npeople don't take any time\nto do dedicated breathwork nor meditate.\nSo, whatever can incentivize\npeople would be wonderful.\nBut the other thing is that\nit's never really been clear\nto me just how much meditation\nis required for a real effect,\nmeaning a practical effect.\nPeople say 30 minutes a\nday, 20 minutes a day,\nonce a week, twice a week,\nsame thing with breathwork.\nFinding minimum or effective thresholds\nfor changing neural circuitry\nis what I think is the holy\ngrail of all these practices.\nAnd that's only going to be determined\nby the sorts of mechanistic\nstudies that you described.\nSo, this is wonderful.\nI do hope the work gets\ncompleted and we can talk\nabout ways that we can ensure\nthat that happens, but-\n- But let me add one thing to\nwhat you're saying, Andrew.\nOne of the issues, I\nthink for a lot of people\nis that there's a placebo effect.\nThat is in humans, they\ncan respond to something\neven though the mechanism has nothing\nto do with what the intervention is.\nAnd so, it's easy to say\nthat the meditative response\nhas a big component,\nwhich is a placebo effect.\nMy mice don't believe\nin the placebo effect.\nAnd so, if we could show there's\na bonafide effect in mice,\nit is convincing in ways that no matter\nhow many human experiments you did,\nthe control for the placebo effect\nis extremely difficult in humans.\nIn mice, it's a non-issue.\nSo, I think that that in of itself\nwould be an enormous message to send.\n- Excellent, and indeed, a better point.\nI think a 30 minute a day\nmeditation in these mice,\nif I understand correctly, the meditation,\nwe don't know what they're\nthinking about, but-\n- Well, it's breath practice really.\n- Right, so it's breath practice.\nSo, because presumably\nthey're not thinking\nabout their third eye center,\nlotus position,\nlevitation, whatever it is.\nThey're not instructed as to what to do,\nand if they were, they\nprobably wouldn't do it anyway.\nSo, 30 minutes a day in which breathing\nis deliberately slowed\nor is slowed relative\nto their normal patterns of breathing.\nGot it.\nWhat was the frequency of\nsighing during that 30 minutes?\nUnclear?\n- We don't know yet.\n- Oh.\n- Well, no, we have the data.\nWe just, we're analyzing that data.\n- To be determined, or to\nbe announced at some point.\nSo, the fear centers\nare altered in some way\nthat creates a shorter fear\nresponse to a foot shock.\n- [Jack] Right.\n- What are some other examples\nthat you are aware of from\nwork in your laboratory\nor work in other\nlaboratories for that matter\nabout interactions between breathing\nand brain state or emotional state?\n- So, this goes back to\nour prior conversation.\nI sort of went off on a tangent.\nI think we need to think\nseparately of the effect\nof volitional changes\nof breathing on emotion\nversus the effect of\nbrain state on breathing.\nSo, the effect of brain state on breathing\nlike when you're stressed is a affect,\npresumably originating in higher centers\nif I can use that term\naffecting breathing.\nIt's the reciprocal is that\nwhen you change breathing,\nit affects your emotional state.\nI think of those two things as different\nand they're ultimately tied together.\nSo, there's a landmark\npaper published in the '50s\nwhere they stimulated\nin the amygdala of cats,\nand depending on where they stimulated,\nthey got profound changes in breathing.\nThere's like every pattern of breathing\ncould possibly imagine,\nthey found the site in the amygdala,\nwhich could produce that.\nSo, there's clearly a powerful\ndescending effect coming\nfrom the amygdala which is a major site\nfor processing emotion,\nfear, stress and whatnot\nthat can affect breathing.\nAnd clearly we have volitional\ncontrol over breathing.\nSo, we have profound effects there.\nNow, I should say about\nemotional control of breathing,\nI need to segue into talking\nabout locked-in syndrome.\nLocked-in syndrome is a devastating lesion\nthat happens in a part of the brainstem\nwhere signals that controlled\nmuscles are transmitted.\nSo the fibers coming\nfrom your motor cortex\ngo down to this part of the brainstem,\nwhich is called the ventral pons.\nAnd if there's a stroke there,\nit can damage these pathways.\nWhat happens in individuals\nwho have locked-in syndrome\nis they lose all volitional movement\nexcept lateral movement of the eyes\nand maybe the ability to blink.\nThe reason they're able to\nstill blink and move their eyes\nis that those control centers\nare rostal, closer to,\nare not interrupted.\nIn other words, the\ninterruption is below that.\nThey continue to breathe\nbecause the centers\nfor breathing don't require\nthat volitional command.\nIn any case, they're below\nthat, so they're fine.\nSo, these people continue to breathe.\nNormal intelligence, but they can't move.\nThere's a great book called\n\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\"\nabout a young man who this happens to,\nand he describes his life\nand it's a real testament\nto the human condition that he does this.\nIt's a remarkable book, it's a short book.\n- Did he write the book by blinking?\nDid they translate it?\n- He did it by blinking to his caretaker.\nIt's pretty amazing.\nAnd there was a movie\nwhich I've never seen\nwith Javier Bardem as the protagonist,\nbut the book I highly recommend\nthis to anyone to read.\nSo, I had colleagues\nstudying an individual\nthat had locked-in syndrome and they,\nthis patient breathed very robotically,\ntotally consistent, very regular.\nThey gave the patient a low\noxygen mixture to breathe.\nVentilation went up, a\nCO2 mixture to breathe,\nventilation went up.\nSo, all the regulatory apparatus\nfor breathing was there.\nThey asked the patient\nto hold his breath or to breathe\nfaster [blows raspberry].\nNothing happened.\nJust the patient recognized the command,\nbut couldn't change it.\nThen all of a sudden,\nthe patient's breathing\nchanged considerably,\nand they said to their\npatient, \"What happened?\"\nThey said, \"You told\na joke and I laughed.\"\nAnd they went back and\nwhenever they told a joke\nthat the patient found funny,\nthe patient's breathing pattern changed.\nAnd you know your breathing\npattern when you laugh\nis [inhales] you inhale,\nyou go ha, ha, ha, ha.\nBut it's also very distinctive.\nWe have some neuroscience\ncolleagues who will go un-named,\nwho, if you heard them\nlaugh 50 yards away,\nyou know exactly who they are.\n- Yeah, well, I'll name him.\nEric Kandel,\n- For one.\n- has an inspiratory laugh.\nHe's famous for a [inhaling],\nas opposed to a ha, ha.\n- Exactly, exactly.\n- Yeah.\nSo, it's very stereotyped,\nbut it's maintained\nand these people lose\nvolitional control of breathing.\nSo, there's an emotive component\ncontrolling your breathing,\nwhich has nothing to do\nwith your volitional control,\nand it goes down to a different pathway\nbecause it's not disrupted\nby this locked-in syndrome.\nIf you look at motor control of the face,\nwe have the volitional\ncontrol of the face,\nbut we also have emotional\ncontrol of the face,\nwhich most of us can't control.\nSo, when we look at another person,\nwe're able to read a lot about\nwhat their emotional state is,\nand that's a lot about\nhow primates communicate,\nhumans communicate and you have people\nwho are good deceivers.\nProbably used car salesman, poker players.\nNow poker players have tells,\nbut many of them now wear dark glasses\nbecause a lot of the tells\nyou blink or whatnot.\n- Pupil sizes and stuff.\n- Pupil size.\nPupil size is a tell, which\nis an autonomic function,\nnot a skeletal muscle function,\nbut we have all these skeletal muscles,\nwhich we're controlling,\nwhich give us away.\nI've tried to get my imaging friends\nto image some of the great actors\nthat we have in Los Angeles.\n- You mean brain imagers.\n- Brain imagers, I'm sorry.\n- Yeah. No, that's all right.\n- I mean, yeah, no, brain imagers.\nBecause I think when I ask you to smile,\nI could tell that you're not happy\nthat you're smiling because\nI asked you to smile.\nI think that you're-\n- I thought you were\nabout to crack a joke,\nbut we're old friends, so, yeah.\n- No, I'm not...\nWhen you see a picture like\nat a birthday or whatnot,\nand say cheese, you could tell\nthat at least half of the people\nare not happy to saying cheese,\nwhereas a great actor when they're able\nto dissemble and the fact that they're sad\nor they're happy, you believe\nthat they're not faking it.\nIt's like, that's great acting.\nAnd I don't think everyone could do that.\nI think that the individuals\nwho are able to do that\nhave some connection to the parts\nof their motive control system\nthat the rest of us don't have.\nMaybe they develop it through\ntraining and maybe not,\nbut I think that this can be imaged\nso I would like to get\none of these great actors\nin a imager and have them go through that\nand then get a normal person,\nand see whether or not\nthey can emulate that\nand I think you're going\nto find big differences\nin the way they control\nthis emotive thing.\nSo, this emotive control\nof the facial muscles,\nI think is in large part,\nsimilar to the emotive\ncontrol of breathing.\nSo, there's that emotive control,\nand there's that volitional\ncontrol and they're different.\nThey're different.\nNow, you asked me about the Yackle stuff.\nThe Yackle paper had to do with ascending,\nthat the effect of breathing on emotion.\nWhat Kevin found was that\nthere was a population\nof neurons in the pre-Botzinger complex\nthat we're always looking at the things\nthat are projecting\nultimately on motor neurons.\nHe found the population of cells\nthat projected to locus coeruleus.\nLocus coeruleus, excuse me,\nis one of those places in the brain\nthat seems to go everywhere.\n- It's like a sprinkler system.\n- Exactly, exactly.\nAnd influence mood, and you've\nhad podcasts about this.\nI mean, there's a lot of stuff\ngoing on with the amygdala,\nso, excuse me, the locus coeruleus.\nSo you get into the locus coeruleus,\nyou can now spray information\nout throughout the entire brain.\nHe found specific cells that projected\nfrom pre-Botzinger to locus coeruleus,\nand that these cells are\ninspiratory modulated.\nNow, it's been known for\na long time since the '60s\nthat if you look in the\nlocus coeruleus of cats\nwhen they're awake,\nyou find many neurons that\nhave respiratory modulation.\nNo one paid much attention.\nWhy bother?\nNot why bother paying attention,\nbut why would the brain\nbother to have these inputs?\nSo, what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwarz\nin Liqun Luo's lab,\nis they killed, ablated,\nthose cells going to locus coeruleus\nfrom pre-Botzinger and\nthe animals became calmer,\nand their EEG levels changed in ways\nthat are indicative\nthat they became calmer.\n- And as I recall, they\ndidn't just become calmer,\nbut they weren't really\ncapable of high arousal states.\nThey were kind of flat.\n- I don't think we really\npursued that in the paper.\nAnd so, we'd have to ask\nJohn Huguenard about that,\nbut I-\n- He's on the other side\nof my lab so we'll ask him.\nBut nonetheless,\nthat beautifully illustrates\nhow there is a bi-directional\ncontrol, right?\nOf emotion-\n- Well, that's ascending.\n- Well, no, the two stories\nof the locked-in syndrome,\nplus the Yackle paper shows\nthat emotional states influence breathing\nand breathing influences emotional states,\nwhich, but you mentioned inspiration,\nwhich I always call inhalation,\nbut people will follow.\nNo, that's fine.\nThose are interchangeable.\nPeople can follow that.\nThere's some interesting\npapers from Noam Sobel's group\nand from a number of other groups\nthat as we inhale or right\nafter we inhale [inhales],\nthe brain is actually\nmore alert and capable\nof storing information\nthan during exhales,\nwhich I find incredible\nbut it also makes sense.\nI'm able to see things far\nbetter when my eyes are open\nthan when my eyelids are\nclosed, for that matter.\n- Maybe, right?\nI mean, I don't doubt,\nNoam's work is great.\nLet me backtrack a bit\nbecause I want people\nto understand that when we're talking\nabout breathing affecting\nemotional cognitive state,\nit's not simply coming from pre-Botzinger.\nThere are at least, well,\nthere are several other sites\nand let me sort of describe,\nI need to sort of go through that.\nOne is olfaction.\nSo, when you're breathing,\nnormal breathing,\nyou're inhaling and exhaling.\nThis is creating signals\ncoming from the nasal mucosa\nthat is going back into\nthe olfactory bulb.\nThat's respiratory modulating.\nAnd the olfactory bulb\nhas a profound influence\nand projections through\nmany parts of the brain.\nSo, there's a signal arising\nfrom this rhythmic moving\nof air in and out of the nose\nthat's going into the brain\nthat has contained in it\na respiratory modulation.\nSo, that signal is there.\nThe brain doesn't have to be using it,\nbut when it's the discriminating\nowner and whatnot,\nthat's riding on a oscillation,\nwhich is respiratory related.\nAnother potential source\nis the vagus nerve.\nThe vagus nerve is a major nerve,\nwhich is containing efferents\nfrom all of the viscera.\n- Efferents just being-\n- A signal.\n- Signals to.\n- Yes.\nSignals from the viscera.\nIt also has signals coming\nfrom the brainstem down,\nwhich are called efferents,\nbut it's getting major signals\nfrom the lung, from the gut.\nAnd this is going up into the brain stem.\nSo, it's there.\nThere are very powerful\nreceptors in the lung\nthat are responding to the lung volume.\nThe lungs stretch.\n- So, bareovers?\nOh, sorry.\nWe have a number of,\n- They're pressure receptors.\n- Like the PA0 receptors of\nthis year's Nobel Prize, yeah.\n- Yeah.\nSo, they're responding to the expansion\nand relaxation in the lung.\nAnd so, if you record\nfrom the vagus nerve,\nyou'll see that there's a huge\nrespiratory modulation due\nto the mechanical changes in the lung.\nNow, why that is of interest is that\nfor some forms of refractory depression,\nelectrical stimulation of the vagus nerve\ncan provide tremendous relief.\nWhy this is the case still\nremains to be determined,\nbut it's clear that\nsignals in the vagus nerve,\nat least artificial\nsignals in the vagus nerve\ncan have a positive effect\non reducing depression.\nSo, it's not a leap to think\nthat under normal circumstances,\nthat that rhythm coming\nin from the vagus nerve\nis playing a role in normal processing.\nOkay, let me continue.\nCarbon dioxide and oxygen levels.\nNow, under normal circumstances,\nyour oxygen levels are fine.\nAnd unless you go to altitude,\nthey don't really change very much,\nbut your CO2 levels can change quite a bit\nwith even a relatively small change\nin your overall breathing.\nThat's going to change your pH level.\nI have a colleague, Alicia Maurette,\nwho has working with patients\nwho are anxious and many\nof them hyperventilate.\nAnd as a result of that hyperventilation,\ntheir carbon dioxide levels are low.\nAnd she has developed\na therapeutic treatment\nwhere she trains these people\nto breathe slower and to restore\ntheir CO2 levels back to normal,\nand she gets relief in their anxiety.\nSo, CO2 levels, which are not\ngoing to affect brain function\non a breath by breath level,\nalthough it does fluctuate\nbreath by breath,\nbut it's sort of this continuous\nbackground can change,\nand if it's changed chronically,\nwe know that highly elevated levels of CO2\ncan produce panic attacks.\nAnd we don't know the degree\nto that gets exacerbated\nby people who have a panic attack,\nthe agree to which\ntheir ambient CO2 levels\nare affecting their degree of discomfort.\n- What about people who\nare, tend to be too calm,\nmeaning that they're feeling sleepy,\nthey're under breathing as\nopposed to over-breathing?\nIs there any knowledge of what the status\nof CO2 is in their system?\n- I don't know which doesn't\nmean there's no knowledge,\nbut I'm unaware but\nthat's blissfully unaware.\nI've not looked at that\nliterature, so I don't know.\n- And I have a feeling, I mean,\nmost people, or excuse me,\nmost of the scientific\nliterature around breathing\nin humans that I'm aware of relates\nto these stressed states because they're\na little bit easier to study in the lab,\nwhereas people feeling under-stimulated\nor exhausted all the time,\nit's a complicated thing to measure.\nI mean, you can do it, but it's not as-\n- Well, CO2's easy to measure.\n- But in terms of sort of the\nmeasures for feeling fatigue,\nthey're somewhat indirect,\nwhereas stress we can get a pulse rates\nin HRV and things of that sort.\n- Well, I'd imagine that these devices\nthat we're all wearing will\nsoon be able to measure,\nwell, now they can measure oxygen levels,\noxygen saturation.\n- Just amazing.\n- Yeah, but oxygen will pretty much stay\nabove 90% unless there's some pathology\nor you go to altitude.\nBut CO2 levels vary\nquite a bit and in fact,\nbecause they vary, your\nbody is so sensitive,\nthe control of breathing,\nlike how much you breathe per minute\nis determined in a very sensitive way\nby the CO2 level.\nSo, even a small change in your CO2\nwill have a significant\neffect on your ventilation.\nSo, this is another thing\nthat not only changes the ventilation,\nbut affects your brain state.\nNow, another thing that\ncould affect breathing,\nor how breathing practice can affect\nyour emotional state is\nsimply descending command\nbecause breathing practice\ninvolves volitional control\nof your breathing,\nand therefore there's a signal\nthat's originating somewhere\nin your motor cortex.\nThat is not, of course,\nthat's going to go down to pre-Botzinger,\nbut it's also going to send off\ncollaterals to other places.\nThose collaterals could\nobviously influence\nyour emotional state.\nSo, we have quite a few\ndifferent potential sources.\nNone of them that are exclusive.\nThere's an interesting paper,\nwhich shows that if you\nblock nasal breathing,\nyou still don't see breathing\nrelated oscillations in the brain.\nAnd this is where I think the mechanism\nis occurring is that these breathing\nrelated oscillations in the brain,\nthey are playing a role\nin signal processing.\nAnd maybe, should I talk a\nlittle bit about the role\nthat oscillations may be\nplaying in signal processing?\n- Definitely, but before you do,\nI just want to ask you\na intermediate question.\nWe've talked a lot about inhalation,\ninspiration and exhalation.\nWhat about breath holds?\nIn apnea, for instance, people\nare holding their breath,\nwhether or not it's\nconscious or unconscious,\nthey're holding their breath.\nWhat's known about breath holds in terms\nof how it might interact with\nbrain state or oxygen CO2,\nand I'm particularly\ninterested in how breath holds\nwith lungs empty versus breath holds\nwith lungs full might differ\nin terms of their impact on the brain.\nI'm not aware of any\nstudies on this looking\nat a mechanistic level,\nbut I find it really interesting\nand even if there are no studies,\nI'd love if you care to speculate.\n- Well, one of the breath practices\nthat intrigued me is where\nyou basically hyperventilate\nfor a minute and then hold your breath\nfor as long as you can.\n- Tummo style,\n- Yeah, brief shots of air.\n- Wim Hof style or,\nwe call it in the laboratory,\nbecause frankly before\nTummo, and before Wim,\nit was referred to as\ncyclic hyperventilation.\nSo, it was basically [panting], right?\nFollowed by a breath\nhold and that breath hold\ncould be done with lungs\nfull or lungs empty.\n- Right, yeah.\nSo, I had a long talk with some colleagues\nabout what they might think\ninline mechanisms are,\nparticularly for the breath hold.\nAnd I certainly envisioned that there's\na component with respect to the presence\nor absence of that\nrhythmicity in your cortex,\nwhich is having effect.\nBut the other thing with\nthe hyperventilation,\nhypoventilation or the apnea\nis your CO2 levels are\ngoing from low to high.\n- Anytime you're holding your breath.\n- Anytime you hold your breath, okay?\nAnd those are going to\nhave a profound influence.\nNow, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia\nbecause there's a lot of work going on\nparticularly with Gordon Mitchell\nat the University of Florida\nis doing some extraordinary\nwork on episodic hypoxia.\nSo, in the '80s,\nDavid Millhorn did some\nreally intriguing work.\nIf I ask you to hold\nyour breath, excuse me.\nIf I gave you a low oxygen\nmixture for a couple of minutes,\nyour breathing level would\ngo up 'cause you want to\nhave more oxygen.\n- You're starving for air.\n- [Andrew and Jack] Yeah.\n- No, you're starving for oxygen.\n- All right.\n- Okay?\nAnd for a couple of minutes, you'd go up.\nYou can reach some steady state level.\nNot so hypoxic that you\ncan't reach an equilibrium.\nAnd then I give you room air again,\nthe ventilation quickly\nrelaxes back down to normal.\nIf on the other hand, I gave\nyou three minutes of hypoxia,\nfive minutes of normoxia,\nthree minutes of hypoxia,\nfive minutes of normoxia,\nthree minutes of hypoxia,\nfive minutes in normoxia-\n- Normoxia being normal air.\n- Normal air.\nYour ventilation goes up, down,\nup, down, up, down, up, down.\nAfter the last episode,\nyour breathing comes down and\ndoesn't continue to come down,\nbut rises again and\nstays up for hours, okay?\nThis is well validated now.\nThis was originally done in animals,\nbut in humans all the time,\nit seems to have profound benefit\non motor function and cognitive function.\n- In what direction?\n- Positive, positive.\nI've often toyed with the\nidea of getting an 8% oxygen,\ndon't do this, listeners,\ngetting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk\nwhen I'm writing a grant and\ndoing like in \"Blue Velvet\"\nand going through the episodic hypoxia\nto improve my cognitive functioning,\n'cause certainly could use improvement\nwhen I'm writing grants.\n- But you could do this\nwithout the low oxygen.\nI mean, you could do this\nthrough breathwork, presumably?\n- It's hard to lower your oxygen enough.\nOkay?\nIn the experimental studies,\nthey typically use 8% oxygen.\nIt's hard to hold your breath long enough.\nAnd there is another difference here,\nthat is what's happening\nto your CO2 levels.\nWhen you hold your breath,\nyour oxygen levels are dropping,\nyour CO2 levels are going up.\nWhen you're doing episodic hypoxia,\nyour CO2 levels are going\nto stay pretty normal\nbecause you're still breathing,\nit's just the oxygen levels are gone.\n- So, unlike normal conditions,\nwhich you described before,\nwhere oxygen is relatively\nconstant and CO2\nis fluctuating depending\non emotional state\nand activity and things of that sort,\nin episodic hypoxia, CO2\nis relatively constant,\nbut you're varying the oxygen level coming\ninto the system quite a bit.\n- I would say it's relatively,\nI would say CO2 is relatively constant,\nbut it's not going to go in a direction\nwhich is going to be\nsignificantly far from normal.\nWhereas when you're holding your breath,\nyou're going to become both hypoxic\nand hypercapnic at the same time.\n- We should explain to people what hypoxic\nand hypercapnic are because we\nhaven't done it.\n- Okay, hypoxic is just\nthe technical term for\nlow levels of oxygen,\nhyper, or you could\nhypoxic, low, hyper is high.\nSo, hyperoxia or hypocapnia,\nlow CO2 or hypercapnia,\nyour highest levels of CO2.\nSo, when you're, in episodic\nhypoxia, if anything,\nyou're going to become\nhypocapnic, not hypercapnic.\nAnd that could play an influence in this.\nOne example that I remember,\nand Gordon will have to forgive\nme if I'm misquoting this,\nis they had a patient who had a stroke\nand had weakness and ankle flection.\nThat is, excuse me, ankle\nextension, to extend the ankle.\nAnd so, they had the patient\nin a seat where they can\nmeasure ankle extension,\nand then they measured it\nand then they exposed the patient\nto episodic hypoxia and\nthey measured again,\nthe strength of the ankle\nextension went way up.\nAnd so, Gordon is looking at this,\nthey're looking at this\nnow for spinal cord rehab.\n- And I imagine for all sorts\nof neuromuscular performance,\nit could be beneficial.\n- Gordon is looking into\nathletic performance.\nWe have a project which\nwe haven't been able\nto push to the next level to do golf.\nSo, I find-\n- Why golf?\n'Cause you love golf?\n- Well, it's because it's\nmotor performance coordination.\nSo, it's not simply\nrunning as fast as you can.\nIt's coordination, it's concentration,\nit's a whole variety of things.\nAnd so, the idea would be\nto get a group of golfers\nand give them the placebo control,\nso they don't know whether\nthey're breathing a gas mixture,\nwhich is just normal air\nor a hypoxic gas mixture,\nalthough they may be able to figure\nit out based on their response.\nDo it under controlled\ncircumstances that do it into a net,\nmeasure their length of their drives,\ntheir dispersion and whatnot,\nand see what happens.\nLook, if we could find that\nthis works for golfers,\nforget about cognitive function.\nWe could sell this for\nunbelievable amounts of money.\n- That sounds like a terrible idea.\n[Jack laughs]\n- By the way, I'm not serious\nabout selling it, but-\n- I know you're joking.\nI mean, maybe people should know\nthat you are joking about that.\nNo, I think that anything\nthat can improve cognitive\nand neuromuscular performance\nis going to be of interest\nfor a wide range of both pathologic states\nlike injury, TBI, et cetera.\nI mean, one of the most frequent questions\nI get is about recovery from concussion\nor traumatic brain injury.\nA lot of people think\nsports, they think football,\nthey think rugby, they think hockey.\nBut if you look at the statistics\non traumatic brain injury,\nmost of it is construction workers,\ncar crashes, bicycle accidents.\nI mean it, the sports\npart of it is a tiny,\ntiny minuscule fraction\nof the total amount\nof traumatic brain injury out there.\nI think these protocols\ntested in the context of golf\nwould be very interesting\nbecause of the constraints\nof the measures as you mentioned,\nand it could be exported\nto a number of things.\nI want to just try and\nimagine whether or not\nthere is any kind of breathing\npattern or breathwork,\njust to be direct about it,\nthat even partially\nmimics what you described\nin terms of episodic hypoxia.\nI've done a lot of Tummo,\nWim Hof cyclic hyperventilation\ntype breathing before.\nMy lab studies this in humans,\nand what we find is that\nif people do cyclic hyperventilation,\nso for about a minute, then exhale,\nhold their breath for 15 to 60 seconds,\ndepending on what they can do,\nand just keep repeating\nthat for about five minutes,\nit seems to me that it\nat least partially mimics\nthe state that you're talking about\nbecause afterwards people\nreport heightened levels\nof alertness, lower levels\nof kind of triggering due\nto stressful events.\nThey feel comfortable at a higher level\nof autonomic arousal, cognitive focus,\na number of improvements\nthat are pretty impressive\nthat any practitioner of Wim Hof or Tummo\nwill be familiar with.\nIs that pattern of breathing even,\ncan we say that it maps\nto what you're describing\nin some general sense?\n- Well, the expert in this\nwould be Gordon Mitchell.\nI would say it moves in that direction,\nbut it's not as extreme\nbecause I don't think\nyou can get down to the levels\nof hypoxia that they do clinically.\nI know that our pals at Our\nBreath Collective actually\njust bought a machine because you buy\na machine that does this.\n- [Andrew] I see.\n- And they bought it and they're going to\ndo their own self testing\nto see whether or not\nthis has any effect on\nanything that they can measure.\nOf course, you have to be concerned\nabout self-experimentation,\nbut I applaud their\ncuriosity and going after it.\n- Hyperbaric chambers.\nI hear a lot nowadays\nabout hyperbaric chambers.\nPeople are buying 'em and using 'em,\nand what are your thoughts\non hyperbaric chambers\nas it relates to any of the-\n- Hyper or hypo?\n- Hyperbaric chambers.\n- Oh, so you're not\ntalkin' about altitude?\n- [Andrew] No.\n- I don't really have much to say.\nI mean, your oxygen levels would\nprobably go up a little bit\nand that could have a beneficial effect,\nbut that's way outside my area of comfort.\n- 2022 I think is going to\nbe the year of two things\nI keep hearing a lot about,\nwhich is the deliberate\nuse of high salt intake\nfor performance increasing\nblood volume, et cetera,\nand hyperbaric chambers\nseem to be catching on much\nin the same way that ice baths were\nand saunas seemed to be\nright now but anyway,\na prediction we can\nreturn to at some point.\nI want to ask you about\nsome of the studies\nthat I've seen out there exploring\nhow deliberately\nrestricting one's breathing\nto nasal breathing can do\nthings like improve memory.\nThere's a couple of papers\nin \"Journal of Neuroscience,\"\nwhich is a respectable\njournal in our field,\none looking at olfactory memory.\nSo, that kind of made\nsense because you can smell\nthings better through\nyour nose than your mouth,\nunless you're some sort of elk\nor something where they can,\npresumably they have some sense\nof smell in their mouth as well.\nBut humans generally\nsmell with their nose.\nThat wasn't terribly surprising,\nbut there was a companion\nstudy that showed\nthat the hippocampus, an area\ninvolved in encoding memories\nin one form or another was\nmore active if you will\nand memory and recall was better\nwhen people learned information\nwhile nasal breathing,\nas opposed to mouth breathing.\nDoes that make sense from\nany mechanistic perspective?\n- Well, given that there's\na major pathway going\nfrom the olfactory system into the brain\nand you cut that and not one\nfrom any receptors in the mouth,\nthe degree of respiratory modulation\nyou're going to see\nthroughout the forebrain\nis going to be less with mouth breathing\nthan nose breathing.\nSo, it's certainly plausible.\nI think there are a lot of experiments\nthat need to be done to distinguish\nbetween the two that\nis the nasal component\nand the non nasal component\nof these breathing related signals.\nBut there's a tendency\nsometimes when you have\na strong effect to be exclusive,\nand I think what's going\non here is that there\nare many inputs that can have an effect.\nNow, whether they're parceled,\nthat some effect this part of behavior\nand some effect that\npart of behavior remains\nto be investigated.\nThere's certainly a strong\nolfactory component.\nMy interest is trying to\nfollow the central component\n'cause we know that there's\na strong central component in this.\nIn fact, there's a\nstrong central projection\nto the olfactory bulb.\nSo, regardless of whether or\nnot there's any air flowing\nin and out of the nose,\nthere's a respiratory input\ninto the olfactory bulb,\nwhich combines with the\nrespiratory modulated signals\ncoming from the sensory receptors.\n- Interesting.\nAnd as long as we are poking\naround, forgive the pun,\nthe nose, what about one nostril\nversus the other nostril?\nI know it sounds a\nlittle crazy to imagine,\nbut there have been\ntheories in yoga traditions\nand others that breathing\nthrough one nostril\nsomehow activates certain brain centers,\nmaybe hemispherically one side\nof the brain versus the other\nor that right nostril and\nleft nostril breathing\nmight differ in terms of the levels\nof alertness or calmness they produce.\nI'm not aware of any\nmechanistic data on that,\nbut if there's anything worthwhile\nabout right nostril versus\nleft nostril breathing\nthat you're aware of, I'd love to know.\n- Well, it certainly plausible.\nI don't know of any data demonstrating it,\nexcept the anecdotal reports of the,\nas you know the brain\nis highly lateralized\nand we have speech on one side\nand a dominant hand that's on one side.\nAnd so, the notion that if you\nhave this huge signal coming\nfrom the olfactory system and it,\nto some degree is lateralized,\nis not perfectly symmetrical.\nThat is one side is not\ngoing evenly to both sides,\nthen you can imagine that once\nthe signal gets distributed\nin a way that's not uniform,\nthat the effectiveness or the response\nis going to be particular to the cortex\nin which either the signal still remains\nor the signal is removed from.\n- I see.\nWhat are some of the other\nfeatures of our brain and body,\nbe it blinking, or eye movements,\nor ability to encode sounds,\nor any features of the\nway that we function\nand move and perceive things\nthat are coordinated with\nbreathing in some interesting way?\n- Thank you for that question.\nAlmost everything.\nSo, we have, for example,\non the autonomic side,\nwe have respiratory sinus arrhythmia.\nThat is during expiration\nthe heart slows down.\nYour pupils oscillate with\nthe respiratory cycle.\nI don't know what the\nfunctional basis for that is,\nbut they do oscillate with\nthe respiratory cycle.\n- When we inhale our pupils constrict,\npresumably 'cause you there's an increase\nin heart rate and sympathetic tone,\nI would think of constriction\nand I'm guessing as you\nrelax the pupil will get,\nand you exhale the pupil will get bigger-\n- I think you're right,\nbut I always get the valance of that-\n- Yeah, well, it's counterintuitive\nbecause people wouldn't think\nthat when the pupils get,\nI mean, it depends.\nI mean, well, you can get\nvery alert and aroused\nin that for stress or for good reasons,\nand the peoples get wider,\nbut your visual field narrows\nand then the opposite is true.\nAnyway, I guess the\nidea is that the pupils\nare changing size and\ntherefore the aperture\nof your visual window is changing\nin coordination with breathing.\n- Okay.\nYour fear response changes\nwith the respiratory cycle.\n- Can you tell us more about that?\n- Well, there's a paper by Solano,\nwhich I think showed rather clearly\nthat if you show individuals fearful faces\nthat their measured response\nof fearfulness changes\nbetween inspiration and expiration.\nI don't know why, but it does.\nYour reaction time changes.\nSo you talk about blinking.\nThe reaction time changes\nbetween inspiration and expiration.\nIf I ask you to punch something that time\nwill change between\ninspiration and expiration.\nIn fact, I don't know the degree\nto which martial artists exploit that.\nYou watch the breathing\npattern and your opponent\nwill actually move slower\nduring one cycle compared to the other.\n- Meaning as they're, in which direction?\nIf they're exhaling,\nthey can punch faster?\n- I have to say, I don't\nkeep a table of which\nis which direction things move in\n'cause I'm out of the\nmartial arts field now.\n- My vague understanding\nis that exhales on strikes\nis the more typical way to do that,\nand so as people strike, they exhale.\nIn many-\n- As you exhale,\nbut there are other components to striking\nbecause you want to stiffen your rib cage,\nyou want to make a Valsalva maneuver.\nSo that's both an\ninspiration and expiration.\nIt's at the same time.\nSo, I don't know enough about,\nwhen you say during expiration,\nI would assume that when\nyou make your strike,\nyou're actually sort of\nwanting to stiffen here,\nwhich is a Valsalva like maneuver.\n- And oftentimes they'll clench\ntheir fist at the last moment.\nAnyway, there's a whole\nset of motor things\nthat we can talk to some fighters.\nWe know people who know fighters,\nso what we can ask them.\nInteresting.\nWhat are some other things that\nare modulated by breathing?\n- I think anything anyone looks at seems\nto have a breathing component\nbecause it's all over your brain,\nand it's hard to imagine\nit not being effective.\nNow, whether it's incidental\nor just background\nand doesn't really have\nany behavioral advantage is possible.\nIn other cases, it might\nhave a behavioral advantage.\nI mean, the big, this eye-opening thing\nfor me probably a decade ago,\nwas digging into literature\nand seeing how much of cortical activity\nand subcortical activity\nhad a respiratory\nmodulator component to it.\nAnd I think a lot of my colleagues\nwho were studying cortex\nare oblivious to this, and they find,\nI heard a talk the other day\nfrom a person who will go un-named,\nwho found a lot of things correlated\nwith a particular movement.\nAnd I think it all, when\nI looked, I said, gee,\nthat's the list of things that\nare respiratory modulated.\nAnd rather than it being correlated\nto the movement they we're looking at,\nI think the movement they were looking at\nwas modulated by breathing,\nas was everything else.\nSo, there wasn't that the movement itself\nwas driving that correlation.\nIt was that they were all\ncorrelated to something else,\nwhich is the breathing movement\nand whether or not that\nis behaviorally relevant,\nor behaviorally something you\ncan exploit, I don't know.\n- I suspect you're right,\nthat breathing is if not the\nfoundational driver of many,\nif not all of these things\nthat it's at least one of\nthe foundational drivers.\n- It's in the background,\nit's in the brain,\nand oscillations play an\nimportant part in brain function.\nAnd they vary in frequency\nfrom maybe 100 hertz down to,\nwell, we can get to circadian\nand sort of monthly cycles,\nbut breathing occupies\na rather unusual place\nin all that because...\nSo, let me talk about what people think\nthe oscillation's is doing,\nparticularly faster ones.\nThey're important in coordinating\nsignals across neurons.\nJust like in a computer, a computer steps.\nSo, a computer knows when\ninformation is coming\nfrom another part of a computer\nso that it was originated\nat a particular time.\nAnd so, that the screen\nby step-by-step thing\nis important in computer control.\nNow, the brain is not a digital device,\nand it's an analog device,\nbut when I have a signal that's\ncoming in my ear and my eye,\nwhich is Andrew Huberman speaking\nand I'm looking at his\nface, I see that as a whole,\nbut the signal is coming into\ndifferent parts of my brain.\nHow do I unify that?\nWell, my neurons are\nvery sensitive to changes\nin signals arriving by\nfractions of a millisecond.\nSo, I know we're sure that those signals\ncoming in represent the same signal.\nWell, if I have throughout my brain\nand isolation and the signals\nride on that oscillation,\nlet's say the peak of the oscillation,\nI can then have a much better handle\non the road of timing and say,\n\"Those two signals came\nin at the same time.\nThey may relate to the\nsame object and ah ha,\nI see you as one unified\nthing spouting talking.\"\nAnd so, these oscillations come\nin many different frequency ranges\nand are important in memory formation\nand all sorts of things.\nI don't think people pay\nmuch attention to breathing\nbecause it's relatively slow to the range\nwhen you think about milliseconds,\nbut we have important\nthings that are thought\nto be important in cognitive function,\nwhich are a few cycles per second\nto 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second.\nBreathing in humans is\nmaybe .2 cycles per second,\nevery five seconds.\nAlthough in rodents they're\nup to four per second,\nwhich is pretty fast.\nSo, but breathing has one\nthing which is special,\nthat is you can readily change it.\nSo, the degree to which the brain is using\nthat slow signal for anything,\nif that becomes part of its\nnormal signal processing,\nyou now change it.\nThat signal processing has to change.\nAnd as that signal processing changes,\nacutely there's a change.\nSo, you asked about breath practice,\nhow long do you have to do it?\nWell, a single breath\nwill change your state.\nYou're nervous, you take a deep breath\nand it seems to help relax,\nso-\n- Or a sigh.\n- Call it what you will,\ncall it what you will.\nIt seems to work.\nNow, it doesn't have a permanent change,\nbut when I'm getting up to bat\nor getting up to the first tee or getting\nto give a big talk or\ncoming to do a podcast,\nI get a little bit anxious, a deep breath,\nor a few deep breaths are\ntremendously effective\nin calming one down.\nAnd so, you can get a\ntransient disruption,\nbut on the other hand, let's\ntake something like depression.\nI think it's, you can envision depression\nas activities sort of\ngoing around in a circuit.\nAnd because it's continuous\nin the nervous system,\nas signals keep repeating,\nthey tend to get stronger\nand they can get so strong,\nyou can't break them.\nSo, you can imagine the depression\nbeing something going on and on and on,\nand you can't break it.\nAnd so, we have trouble\nwhen we get for certain\nlevels of depression,\nI mean, all of us get\ndepressed at some point,\nbut if it's not continuous,\nit's not long lasting,\nwe're able to break it.\nBut if it's long lasting and\nvery deep, we can't break it.\nSo, the question is how do we break it?\nWell, there are extreme\nmeasures to break it.\nWe could do electroconvulsive shock.\nWe shock the whole brain.\nThat's disrupting activity\nin the whole brain.\nAnd when this circuit starts\nto get back together again,\nit's been disruptive.\nAnd we know that the brain,\nwhen signals get disrupted a little bit,\nwe can weaken the\nconnections and weakening\nthe connections of this then\nin this circuit involved in depression,\nwe may get some relief and\nelectroconvulsive shock\ndoes work for relieving\nmany kinds of depression.\nThat's pretty heroic.\nFocal deep brain stimulation\ndoes the same thing,\nbut more localized or\ntranscranial stimulation.\nYou're disrupting a network.\nAnd while it's getting back together,\nit may weaken some of the connections.\nIf breathing is playing\nsome role in this circuit,\nand now, instead of doing\nlike a one second shock,\nI do 30 minutes of disruption\nby doing slow breathing\nor other breathing practice,\nthose circuits begin to\nbreak down a little bit,\nand I get some relief.\nAnd if I continue to do\nit before the circuit\ncan then build back up again,\nI gradually can wear that circuit down.\nI sort of liken this,\nI tell people it's like\nwalking around on a dirt path.\nYou build a rut, the rut gets so deep\nyou can't get out of it.\nAnd what breathing is\ndoing is sort of filling\nin the right rut bit by bit\nto the point that you can\nclimb out of that rut.\nAnd that is because the breathing signal\nis playing some role in\nthe way the circuit works,\nand then when you disrupt that,\nthe circuit gets a\nlittle thrown off kilter,\nand as you know when\ncircuits get thrown off,\nthe nervous system tries to\nadjust in some way or another,\nand it turns out at least for breathing\nfor some evolutionary reason,\nor just by happenstance,\nit seems to improve\nour emotional function,\nand our cognitive function.\nAnd we're very fortunate\nthat that's the case.\n- It's a terrific segue into\nwhat I want to ask you next,\nand this is part of a set of questions\nI want to make sure we\ntouch on before we wrap up,\nwhich is what do you do\nwith all this knowledge\nin terms of a breathing practice?\nYou mentioned that one breath can shift\nyour brain state and that\nitself can be powerful.\nI think that's absolutely true.\nYou've also talked about 30\nminute breathwork practices,\nwhich is 30 minutes of breathwork,\nis a pretty serious commitment\nI think, but it's doable.\nCertainly a zero cost,\nexcept for the time in most cases.\nWhat do you see out there in\nthe landscape of breathwork\nthat's being done that you\nlike, and why do you like it?\nWhat do you think you,\nor what would you like to see more of\nin terms of exploration of\nbreathwork and what do you do?\n- Well, I'm a relatively\nnew convert to breathwork.\nThrough my own investigation of it,\nI became convinced that it's real,\nand I'm basically a beginner\nin terms of my own practice.\nAnd I like to keep things simple,\nand I think I've discussed this before.\nI liken it to someone who's a couch potato\nwho was told they got\nto begin to exercise.\nYou don't go out and run a marathon.\nSo, couch potato, you say,\nokay, get up and walk for\nfive minutes and 10 minutes.\nAnd then, okay, now you're\nwalking for a longer period.\nYou'll begin to run, and\nthen you reach a point,\nyou say, well, gee, I'm\ninterested in this sport.\nAnd there may be particular\nkinds of practices\nthat you can use that could be helpful\nin optimizing performance of that sport.\nI'm not there yet.\nI find I get tremendous benefit\nby relatively short periods\nbetween five and maybe 20 minutes\nof doing box breathing.\nIt's very simple to do.\nI have a simple app, which\nhelps me keep the timing.\n- Do you recall which app it is?\nIs it the Apnea Trainer?\nIs that the one?\n- Well, I was using Calm for a long time,\nbut I let my subscription lapse\nand I have another one whose\nname I don't remember but it's,\nso it's very simple and it works for me.\nI'm now trying this Tummo,\nbecause I'm just curious\nand exploring it because it may be acting\nfor a different way and I want to see\nif I respond differently.\nSo, I don't have a\nparticular point of view.\nNow, I have friends and colleagues\nwho are into particular\nstyles like Wim Hof.\nAnd I think what he's doing is great\nand getting people who are interested.\nI think the notion is that I would like\nto see more people exploring\nthis and to some degree,\nas you point out, 30 minutes a day,\nsome of the breath patterns\nthat some of these stars\nlike Wim Hof are a little\nintimidating to newbies.\nAnd so, I would like to\nsee something very simple,\nthat what I tell my friends is, look,\njust try it five or 10 minutes.\nSee if you feel better,\ndo it for a few days.\nIf you don't like it, stop\nit, it doesn't cost anything.\nAnd invariably, they\nfind that it's helpful.\nI will often interrupt my day\nto take five or 10 minutes.\nLike, if I find that I'm lagging...\nI think there's some pretty good data\nthat your performance\nafter lunch declines.\nAnd so, very often what\nI'll do after lunch,\nwhich I didn't do today\nis take five or 10 minutes\nand just sort of breath practice.\n- And lately, what does that\nbreath practice look like?\n- It's just box breathing\nfor five to 10 minutes.\n- And the duration of\nyour inhales and holds\nand exhales and holds is set by the app?\nIs that right?\n- Well, I do five seconds.\n- So, five seconds\ninhale, five second hold,\nfive second, exhale, five second hold.\n- Yeah, and sometimes I'll do doubles.\nI'll do 10 seconds just\nbecause I get bored.\nIt's just, I feel like doing\nit and it's very helpful.\nI mean...\nNow, that's not the only thing I do\nwith respect to trying to\nmaintain my sanity and my health.\n- No, I can imagine there'd\nbe a number of things,\nalthough, because you seem\nvery sane and very healthy,\nI in fact, know that you\nare both of those things.\n- Right, you suspect that I am.\n- I suspect that there's data.\nAwhile back we had a conversation,\na casual conversation,\nbut you said something that\nreally stuck in my mind,\nwhich is that it might be\nthat the specific pattern of breathwork\nthat one does is not as important\nas experiencing transitions\nbetween states based\non deliberate breathwork or\nsomething to that extent,\nwhich I interpreted to mean that if I were\nto do box breathing with five second in,\nfive seconds hold, five second exhale,\nfive second hold for a couple of days,\nor maybe even a couple of\nminutes and then switch\nto 10 seconds or then switch to Tummo,\nthat there's something powerful perhaps\nin the transitions and\nrealizing the relationship\nbetween different patterns of breathing\nin those transitions,\nmuch in the same way that you can get\ninto one of these cars\nat an amusement park\nthat just goes at a constant\nrate and then stops.\nVery different than\nlearning how to shift gears.\nI used to drive a manual.\nI still can so I'm thinking\nabout a manual transmission,\nbut even with an automatic transmission,\nyou start to get a sense\nof how the vehicle behaves\nunder different conditions.\nAnd I thought that was a beautiful seed\nfor a potential breathwork practice\nthat at least to my awareness,\nnobody has really formalized,\nwhich is that you\nintroduce some variability\nwithin the practice that's somewhat random\nin order to be able to\nsense the relationship\nbetween different speeds\nand depths of inhales,\nexhales and holds and so forth.\nAnd essentially, it's like\ndriving around the track,\nbut with obstacles at different rates\nand breaking and restarting\nand things of that sort,\nthat's how you learn how to drive.\nWhat do you think about that\nand if you like it enough,\ncan we call it the Feldman protocol?\n- Oh, please [laughs].\nI was asked in this BBC interview once why\ndidn't I name it the Feldman complex,\ninstead of pre-Botzinger complex?\n- You said I already\nhave a Feldman complex.\n- Well, it sounds like\na psychiatric disorder,\nbut I think the primary effect\nis this disruptive effect,\nwhich I described,\nbut the particular responses\nmay clearly vary depending\non what that disruption is.\nI don't know of any particular data,\nwhich are as in well\ncontrolled experiments,\nwhich can actually work\nthrough the different types\nof breathing patterns or\nsimply with a box pattern,\njust varying the durations.\nI mean, pranayama is sort of similar,\nbut the amount of time you spend\ngoing around the box is different.\nSo, I don't really have\nmuch to say about this.\nI mean, this is why we need\nbetter controlled experiments\nin humans and I think\nthis is where being able\nto study in rodents where you can have\na wide range of perturbations\nwhile you're doing more invasive studies\nto really get down as to\nwhich regions are affected,\nhow was the signal processing disrupted,\nwhich is still a hypothesis,\nbut how it's disrupted could tell us a lot\nabout maybe there's a resonant point\nat which there's an optimal effect\nwhen you take a particular\nbreathing practice.\nAnd then when we talked about the fact\nthat different breathing practices\ncould be affecting the outcomes\nthrough different pathways.\nYou have the olfactory pathway,\nyou have a central pathway,\nyou have a vagal pathway, you\nhave a descending pathway,\nhow different practices may change\nthe summation of those things\nbecause I think all those\nthings are probably involved,\nand we're just beginning\nto scratch the surface.\nAnd I just hope that we can\nget serious neuroscientists\nand psychologists to do\nthe right experiments\nto get at this because I think\nthere's a lot of value\nto human health here.\n- I do too, and it's one\nof the reasons my lab\nhas shifted to these\nsorts of things in humans.\nI'm delighted that you're continuing\nto do the hardcore\nmechanistic work in mice\nand probably do work in\nhumans already as well,\nif you're not already.\nAnd there are other\ngroups, Epel Lab at UCF,\nand a number of, I'm starting\nto see some papers out there\nabout respiration in humans a little bit,\nsome more brain imaging.\nI can't help but ask about\na somewhat unrelated topic,\nbut it is important in\nlight of this conversation\nbecause you're here,\nand one of the things that I really enjoy\nabout conversations with you as it relates\nto health and neuroscience\nand so forth is that,\nyou're one of the few colleagues I have\nwho openly admits to\nexploring supplementation.\nI'm a long time supplement fan.\nI think there's power in compounds,\nboth prescription, non-prescription,\nnatural, synthesized.\nI don't use these haphazardly,\nbut I think there's\ncertainly power in them.\nAnd one of the places\nwhere you and I converge\nis in terms of our interest\nin the nervous system\nand supplementation is\nvis-a-vis magnesium.\nNow, I've talked endlessly on the podcast\nand elsewhere about\nmagnesium for sake of sleep,\nand improving transit transitions\nto sleep and so forth.\nBut you have a somewhat\ndifferent interest in magnesium\nas it relates to cognitive function\nand durability of cognitive function.\nWould you mind just sharing\nwith us a little bit\nabout what that interest\nis, where it stems from,\nand because it's The Huberman Podcast,\nand we often talk about supplementation,\nwhat you do with that information.\n- So, I need to disclose\nthat I am a scientific advisor\nto a company called Neurocentria,\nwhich my graduate student,\nGuosong Liu is CEO.\nSo that said, I can give\nyou some background.\nGuosong, although when he was\nin my lab worked on breathing,\nhad a deep interest in\nlearning and memory.\nAnd when he left my lab,\nhe went to work for it\nwith a renowned learning memory\nguy at Stanford, Dick Chen.\nAnd when he finished there,\nhe was hired by Susumu Tonegawa at MIT.\n- Who also knows a thing\nor two about memory.\nI'm teasing.\nSusumu Tonegawa has a Nobel for\nhis work on immunoglobulins,\nbut then is a world-class\nmemory researcher.\n- Yeah, and more.\n- He's many things.\n- And Guosong had very\ncurious, very bright guy,\nand he was interested in how signals\nbetween neurons get strengthened,\nwhich is called long-term\npotentiation or LTP.\nAnd one of the questions that arose\nwas if I have inputs to\na neuron and I get LTP,\nis the LTP bigger if the signal is bigger\nor the noise is less?\nSo, we can imagine that when\nwe're listening to something,\nif it's louder, we can hear it better.\nOr if this less noise,\nwe can hear it better.\nAnd he wanted to investigate this.\nSo I did this in tissue\nculture of hippocampal neurons,\nand what he found was that if he lowered\nthe background activity\nin all of the neurons,\nthat the LTP he elicited got stronger,\nand the way he did that was increasing\nthe level of magnesium\nin the bathing solution.\nThis gets into some\nesoteric electrophysiology,\nbut basically there's a background level\nof noise in all neurons,\nand that part of it is\nregulated by the degree\nof magnesium in the extracellular bath.\n- And you mean electrical noise.\n- Electrical noise, I'm\nsorry, electrical noise.\nAnd if you, in what's called\nthe physiological range,\nwhich is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar,\nwhich don't worry about the number.\n- I can't believe you\nremember the millimolar\nof the magnesium.\n- Well, I'm always frightened that I get,\nI say micro or femto or something,\nI go off by several orders of magnitude,\nbut so in that physiological range,\nthere's a big difference\nin the amount of noise\nin a neuron between\n0.8 and 1.2 millimolar.\nSo, he played around with the magnesium,\nand he found out that when\nthe magnesium was elevated,\nit was more LTP.\nAll right, that's an\nobservation in a tissue culture.\n- Right, and I should just mention\nthat more LTP essentially translates\nto more neuro-plasticity,\nmore rewiring of connections in essence.\n- So, he tested this\nin mice and basically,\nhe offered them a,\nhe had control mice,\nwhich got a normal diet and one that had,\none enriched in magnesium,\nand the ones that lived\nenriched with magnesium\nhad higher cognitive\nfunction, lived longer,\neverything you'd want in some magic pill,\nthose mice did that.\nExcuse me, rats.\nThe problem was that you\ncouldn't imagine taking this\ninto humans because most magnesium salts\ndon't passively get from the\ngut into the bloodstream,\ninto the brain.\nThey pass via what's called a transporter.\nTransporter is something in a membrane\nthat grabs a magnesium molecule or atom,\nand pulls it into the other side.\nSo if you're imagining you\nhave magnesium in your gut,\nyou have transporters\nthat pull the magnesium\nin the gut into the bloodstream.\nWell, if you take a normal\nmagnesium supplement\nthat you can buy at the pharmacy,\nit doesn't cross the gut very easily.\nAnd if you would take enough\nof it to get it in your bloodstream,\nyou start getting diarrhea.\nSo it's not a good way to go.\n- Well, it is a good way to go.\nI couldn't help myself.\n- [laughs] Well said.\nSo, he worked with this\nbrilliant chemist, Fay Mow,\nand Fay looked at a whole\nrange of magnesium compounds\nand he found that magnesium threonate\nwas much more effective in\ncrossing the gut blood barrier.\nNow, they didn't realize at the time,\nbut threonate is a\nmetabolite of vitamin C,\nand there's lots of\nthreonate in your body.\nSo magnesium threonate\nwould appear to be safe\nand maybe part of the role\nor now they believe it's part of the role\nof the threonate is that it supercharges\nthe transporter to get the magnesium in.\nAnd remember, you need\na transporter at the gut\ninto the brain and into cells.\nSo, they gave magnesium\nthreonate to mice who had,\nno, let me backtrack a bit.\nThey did a study in humans.\nThey hired a company to do a\ntest that was a hands-off test.\nIt's one of these\ncompanies that gets hired\nby the big pharma to\ndo their test for them,\nand they got patients who were diagnosed\nas mild cognitive decline.\nThese are people who\nhad cognitive disorder,\nwhich was age inappropriate.\nAnd the metric that they\nuse for a determining\nhow far off they were\nis Spearman's G factor,\nwhich is a generalized\nmeasure of intelligence\nthat most psychologists except,\nand the biological age\nof the subjects was,\nI think 51 and the\ncognitive age was 61 based\non the Spearman's G's test.\nOh, I should say the\nSpearman G factor starts\nat a particular level in the population\nat age 20 and declines about 1% a year.\nSo, sorry to say, we're\nnot 20 year olds anymore,\nbut when you get a number from that,\nyou can put on the curve and see whether\nit's about your age or not.\nThese people were about\n10 years older according\nto that metric and long story\nshort after three months\nthis is a placebo controlled\ndouble blind study.\nThe people who were in the\nplacebo arm improved two years,\nwhich is common for human\nstudies 'cause a placebo effect.\nThe people who got the compound\nimproved eight years on average,\nand some improved more than eight years.\nThey didn't do any further\ndiagnosis as to what caused\nthe molecule to decline but it was pretty,\nit was extraordinarily impressive.\n- So, it moved their cognition closer\nto their biological age?\n- Biological age.\nBiological age.\n- Do you recall what the\ndoses of magnesium threonate-\n- It's in the paper and it's basically\nwhat they have in the compound,\nwhich is sold commercially.\nSo, the compound which\nis sold commercially\nis handled by a nutraceutical wholesaler\nwho sells it to the retailers\nand they make whatever\nformulation they want.\nBut it's a dosage which is,\nmy understanding is rarely tolerable.\nI take half a dose.\nThe reason I take half a dose\nis that I had my blood magnesium measured,\nand it was low normal for my age.\nI took half a dose, it became high normal,\nand I felt comfortable\nstaying in the normal range,\nbut a lot of people are taking\nthe full dose and at my age,\nI'm not looking to get smarter,\nI'm looking to decline more slowly.\nAnd it's hard for me to tell you whether\nor not it's effective or not.\n- Well, you remembered the\nmillimolar of the magnesium\nand the solution and on\nthe high and low end,\nso I would say it's not\na well controlled study\nand it's an N of one, but\nit seems to be working.\n- When I've recommended it to my friends,\nacademics who are not by nature skeptical,\nif not cynical, and I\ninsist that they try it,\nthey usually don't report a major change\nin their cognitive function,\nalthough sometimes they do report,\n\"Well, I feel a little\nbit more alert than my,\nmy physical movements are better,\"\nbut many of them report they sleep better.\n- And that makes sense.\nI think there's good\nevidence that threonate\ncan accelerate the transition\ninto sleep and maybe even access\nto deeper modes of sleep for some people.\nFor many people actually,\na small percentage of\npeople who take threonate\nincluding one of our podcast staff here\nhave stomach issues with it.\nThey can't tolerate it.\nSo, I would say just anecdotally,\nabout 5% of people don't\ntolerate threonate well.\nStop taking it and then they're fine.\nIt caused them diarrhea\nor something of that sort,\nbut most people tolerate it well\nand most people report that it\nvastly improves their sleep.\nAnd again, that's anecdotally.\nThere are a few studies and\nthere are more on the way,\nbut that's very interesting because I,\nuntil you and I had the\ndiscussion about threonate,\nI wasn't aware of the\ncognitive enhancing effects,\nbut the story makes sense from\na mechanistic perspective.\nAnd it brings it around to a bigger\nand more important statement,\nwhich is that I so appreciate\nyour attention to mechanism.\nI guess this stems from\nyour early training\nas a physicist and the\ndesire to get numbers\nand to really parse\nthings at a fine level.\nSo, we've covered a lot today.\nI know there's much more\nthat we could cover.\nI'm going to insist on a\npart two at some point,\nbut I really want to speak on behalf\nof a huge number of\npeople and just thank you,\nnot just for your time and\nenergy and attention to detail\nand accuracy and clarity\naround this topic today,\nbut also what I should\nhave said at the beginning,\nwhich is that you really are a pioneer\nin this field of studying respiration\nand the mechanisms underlying respiration\nwith modern tools for\nnow for many decades,\nand the field of neuroscience was one\nthat was perfectly\ncontent to address issues\nlike memory and vision and\nsensation perception, et cetera.\nBut the respiratory system\nwas largely overlooked\nfor a long time and you've just\nbeen steadily clipping away\nand clipping away and\nmuch cause of the events\nof related to COVID and\na number of other things,\nand this huge interest in breathwork\nand brain states and wellness,\nthe field of respiration\nand interest in respiration\nhas just exploded.\nSo, I really want to\nextend a sincere thanks.\nIt means a lot to me,\nand I know to the audience of this podcast\nas someone with your depth\nand rigor in this area\nis both a scientist and a practitioner,\nand that you would share this with us.\nSo, thank you.\n- Well, I want to thank you.\nThis is actually a great\nopportunity for me.\nI've been isolated in\nmy silo for a long time,\nand it's been a wonderful\nexperience to communicate\nto people outside the silo\nwho have an interest in this.\nAnd I think that there's a\nlot that remains to be done,\nand I enjoy speaking to people\nwho have interest in this.\nI find the interest to\nbe quite mind-boggling\nand it's quite wonderful\nthat people are willing to,\nand listen to things that can\nbe quite esoteric at times,\nbut it gets down to deep\nthings about who we are\nand how we are going to live our lives.\nSo, I appreciate the opportunity\nand I would be delighted\nto come back at any time.\n- Wonderful.\nWe will absolutely do it.\nThanks again, Jack.\n- Bye now.\n- Thank you for joining\nme for my conversation\nwith Dr. Jack Feldman.\nI hope you

Podcast\nat any level that you like.\nIn addition, if you're\nnot already following us\non Instagram and Twitter,\nI teach neuroscience on\nInstagram and Twitter.\nSome of that information\ncovers information covered\non the podcast,\nsome of that information\nis unique information,\nand that includes science\nand science-based tools\nthat you can apply in everyday life.\nDuring today's podcast,\nand on many previous podcast episodes,\nwe talk about supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them.\nOne of the key issues with supplements\nif you're going to take\nthem is that they be\nof the utmost quality.\nFor that reason, The Huberman Lab Podcast\nhas partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.\nThorne Supplements are of\nthe very highest quality,\nboth with respect to the quality\nof the ingredients themselves,\nand the precision of the\namounts of the ingredients.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, many supplement companies\nout there list amounts\nof particular substances on the bottle,\nand when they've been tested,\nthey do not match up to what's\nactually in those products.\nThorne has the highest\nlevels of stringency\nfor quality and the particular amounts\nthat are in each product.\nThey partnered with the Mayo Clinic\nand all the major sports teams,\nso there's tremendous\ntrust in Thorne products.\nThat's why we partnered with them.\nIf you're interested in seeing\nthe supplements that I take,\nyou can go to thorne.com/\nthe letter U /huberman.\nYou can see the supplements\nthat I take from Thorne.\nIf you purchase any of\nthose supplements there,\nyou can get 20% off and\nif you navigate further\ninto the Thorne site to see the huge array\nof other products that they make,\nif you go in through\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou'll also get 20% off any\nof the products that Thorne makes.\nI also want to just mention one more time,\nthe program that I\nmentioned at the beginning\nof the episode, which is\nOur Breath Collective,\nthe Our Breath Collective\nhas an advisory board that includes people\nlike Dr. Jack Feldman,\nwhere you can learn detailed\nbreathwork protocols.\nIf you're interested in\ndoing or teaching breathwork,\nI highly recommend checking it out.\nYou can find it at\nourbreathcollective.com/huberman,\nand that will give you\n$10 off your first month.\nSo, I want to thank you\nonce again for joining me\nfor my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman,\nand last but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat
