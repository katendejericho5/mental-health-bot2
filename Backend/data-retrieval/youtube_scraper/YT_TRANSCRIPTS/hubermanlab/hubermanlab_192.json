    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[mellow music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman and I'm\na Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday we're talking all about habits.\nIn particular,\nwe're going to discuss the\nbiology of habit formation\nand the biology of how we break habits.\nI think we can all appreciate\nthe value of having habits.\nHabits organize our behavior\ninto more or less reflexive actions\nso we don't have to think too much\nabout performing the various\nbehaviors that, for instance,\nallow us to brush our teeth\nor which side of bed we\nroll out of in the morning.\nAnd then of course, habits\ncan be more elaborate too.\nWe can be in the habit of exercising\nat a particular time of day.\nWe can be in the habit\nof eating certain foods.\nWe can be in the habit of\nsaying or saying certain things.\nBut of course,\nthere are many habits\nthat don't serve us well,\nor that perhaps even\nundermine our immediate\nand long term health goals\nand psychological goals.\nAnd even some habits\nthat can really undermine\nour overall life goals.\nSo today we're going to talk\nabout making, meaning forming,\nand breaking, meaning\nstopping, various habits.\nThere's a lot of information\nout there about habits.\nYou'll find this in the popular sphere.\nThere are books, there are\narticles, there are workshops,\nand so forth.\nHowever, lesser known is that\nthere's a whole neuroscience\nof habit formation and habit breaking.\nAnd there's a whole field\nof psychology devoted\nto understanding habit\nformation and habit breaking.\nAnd within those scientific literatures,\nI think there are some real gems that,\nat least to my knowledge,\nwe haven't paid too much attention to\nin the popular sphere.\nSo today,\nwe're going to talk about the\nbiology of habit formation\nand habit breaking.\nI'm going to boil these down\nto some very explicit steps\nthat anyone can use.\nMy reasoning for doing\nthat is, first of all,\nit's the end of 2021.\nMany people are thinking\nabout new year's resolutions.\nThey're thinking about leaving\nsome things behind from 2021\nand previous.\nAnd acquiring some new behaviors,\ntaking on some new challenges,\nand trying to bring new\nthings to their lives.\nBut regardless of when\nyou're listening to this,\nthe programs that I'll outline\nare grounded in the neuroscience\nand biology of habit formation.\nAnd they map very well\nto what the psychologists have described,\nin terms of habit formation and breaking.\nSo today you're going to\nlearn a lot of science,\nyou're also going to come\naway with some practical tools\nand I'm certain that regardless\nof your present state\nor goals, there'll be\nsomething of value to you.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic greens is in all-in-one vitamin,\nmineral, probiotic drink.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens is\nthat because of the\ningredients it contains,\nI know that I'm covering\nall of my foundation needs\nfor vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge\nnow pointing to the fact\nthat the so-called\ngut-brain axis is important\nfor our brain health,\nfor our metabolic health,\nfor our hormone health,\nfor our immune system,\nso the probiotics, vitamins,\nand minerals really support that system.\nAnd many of the other things it contains\ngenerally support our health,\nin terms of neural\nsystem, meaning the brain,\nthe spinal cord, et cetera.\nBasically, Athletic Greens\nhas all the things I need,\nnothing I don't, and by\ntaking it once or twice a day,\nI always feel better\nand I know that I'm covering all my bases.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road, in the car,\nor on the plane, et cetera.\nPlus, a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim this special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood-work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat most of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays, with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get insight\ninto your particular needs\nfor your genetic type.\nNow, a major issue with\na lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there is\nyou get the numbers back,\nyou get a lot of information back,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes that very easy.\nThey have a personalized platform\nwhere you get your numbers\nand it points to specific\nthings that you can do,\nin terms of behavioral protocols,\nmeaning things you perhaps\nshould do more of or less of,\nnutritional protocols,\nthings that you perhaps should\ningest more of or less of,\nand various things that you might consider\nfor more elaborate, directed approaches\nto adjusting the numbers in\nyour blood and DNA profiles.\nAnother feature of InsideTracker,\nis that it has what's\ncalled \"The Inner Age Test\".\nThis test allows you to see\nwhat your biological age is\nand compare that to\nyour chronological age.\nOf course,\nyour biological age is the\none that you can control\nand that's the one that's really important\nto your immediate and long-term health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat I truly believe\nare the best out there.\nI've been sleeping on a Helix mattress\nfor about a year now\nand it's the best sleep I've ever had.\nOne thing that makes Helix\nmattresses really unique\nis that they are tailored\nto your unique sleep needs.\nYou can go to their\nwebsite, you take a quiz,\nit only takes about two minutes,\nand it will match your body\ntype and sleep preferences\nto a particular mattress.\nSo, it will ask you questions such as,\n\"Do you sleep on your side,\nyou back, or your stomach?\"\n\"Do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night?\"\nMaybe you don't know.\nYou answer those questions\nand it matches you\nto the mattress that's right for you.\nFor me, that turned out to be\nthe Dusk Mattress, D U S K.\nI wanted a mattress that\nwasn't too firm, not too soft.\nAnyway, I matched to the Dusk.\nI've been sleeping on a Dusk Mattress,\nas I mentioned before.\nIt's been the best experience for me.\nMy sleep is so improved.\nSo if you're interested\nin upgrading your mattress\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two-minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you.\nAnd you'll get up to $200\noff all mattress orders\nand two free pillows.\nAgain, go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their quiz, match to the\nmattress that's right for you,\nand if you decide to purchase it,\nyou'll get up to $200\noff all mattress orders\nand two free pillows.\nThey have a ten-year warrantee\nand if you want to try\nit out, you can do that\nfor 100 nights risk-free.\nThey'll even pick the mattress up for you\nif you don't love it,\nbut I'm pretty confident that you will.\nAgain, helixsleep.com/huberman\nis where you'll find the\nHelix mattress for you.\nLet's talk about habits.\nAnd anytime we're talking about habits,\nthat means our nervous\nsystem learns something.\nNow, many people think that\nhabits are just like reflexes,\nbut pure reflexes are things\nlike the eye blink reflex.\nYou know, something comes towards your eye\nand you don't want it to get\nin your eye, you'll blink.\nOr if you happen to\nstep on a sharp object,\nor get too close to\nsomething that's too hot,\nyou'll reflexively move away.\nThose aren't habits.\nThose are what we call\nhard-wired reflexes.\nHabits are things that our\nnervous system learned,\nbut not always consciously.\nSometimes we develop habits\nthat we're not even aware of\nuntil they become a problem\nor maybe they serve us well.\nWho knows?\nBut the fact of the matter is\nthat habits are a big part of who we are.\nWhat we do habitually makes up\nmuch of what we do entirely.\nIn fact, it's estimated\nthat up to 70% of our\nwaking behavior is made up\nof habitual behavior.\nSo, you can imagine that\nthere's a lot of biology,\nmeaning cells and hormones and\nneural pathways, et cetera,\nthat are going to support\ndevelopment of those habits.\nSo if habits are largely, learned,\nconsciously or unconsciously,\nwe have to ask ourselves,\nwhat is learning?\nWell, learning is neuroplasticity.\nNeuroplasticity is simply the process\nby which our nervous system changes\nin response to experience.\nWe have to ask, what changes?\nWell, what changes are the\nconnections between neurons.\nNeurons are just nerve cells.\nThey communicate with one\nanother by electricity\nand by sending chemical\nsignals to one another\nthat inspire the next\nneuron and the next neuron\nto either electrically active or not.\nBut at the end of the day,\nneuroplasticity is about\nforming new neural circuits,\nnew pathways by which certain\nhabits are likely to occur,\nand other ones are less likely to occur.\nSo, we've got habits.\nWe have that habits are learned,\nwe have that learning\ninvolves neuroplasticity,\nand that neuroplasticity involves changes\nin the connections between\nneurons, nerve cells.\nOkay, so that describes\nhabits through the lens\nof neuroscience and biology,\nbut as many of you are well aware,\nthere are popular books about habits\nand there's a whole psychological\nliterature about habits,\nand those two areas point\nto some very interesting aspects of habits\nthat I think are worth mentioning.\nFirst of all is this notion\nof immediate goal-based habits\nversus identity-based habits.\nImmediate goal-based habits\nare going to be habits\nthat are designed to bring\nyou a specific outcome\nas you do them,\nso each and every time you do them.\nSo for instance,\nit might be that you want to\ndevelop a habit of getting,\nyou know, 60 minutes of\nzone II cardio each day,\nor perhaps 3-4 times per week,\nas we head into the new year.\nI've talked before on the\npodcast about the fact\nthat the scientific literature\nand the health literature really points\nto the incredibly positive effects\nof getting 150 minutes to\n180 minutes per week minimum\nof what's called zone II cardio.\nZone II cardio is basically\nany cardiovascular exercise\nthat gets you moving,\nand your heart pumping,\nand breathing,\nbut not so hard that you\ncan't hold a conversation,\nand so that kind of puts\nyou at the threshold\nof just being just able\nto have a conversation\nthat's a little bit strained,\nbut if you were to exercise\na little bit harder,\nyou know, run a little\nbit faster, et cetera,\nyou wouldn't be able to\ntalk while you did it.\nThere's a lot of literature\nthat points to that\nas a healthy practice.\nSo maybe you're somebody that wants\nto get more of zone II\ncardio, for instance.\nThat would be an\nimmediate goal-based habit\nif your goal is to get that cardio,\nmaybe 4 times a week.\nEvery time you do it you\ncheck off a little box\nand you say, \"Okay, I did\nit.\" You met the goal.\nThat is different than\nso-called identity-based habits\nwhere there's a larger,\nover-arching theme to the habit,\nwhere you're trying to\nbecome, quote unquote,\n\"a fit person\".\nOr you're somebody who\nwants to be an athlete\nor something of that sort.\nIt's where you start to attach\nsome sort of larger picture\nabout yourself or what it\nmeans for you to do that habit\nwhere there's both the\nimmediate goal, right?\nComplete the exercise,\ncomplete the session,\nor whatever it is, check off that box.\nBut that you're linking it\nto some sort of larger goal.\nNow, why am I making this distinction?\nI mean, first of all,\nI'm not the one to first\nmake this distinction.\nOthers have made the\ndistinction between identity\nversus immediate\ngoal-based habit formation.\nBut the reason I'm\nmaking the distinction is\nthat pretty soon in our discussion today\nwe are going to talk about dopamine,\na molecule that's associated\nwith motivation and reward,\nthat we make in our brain,\nand how different schedules\nof dopamine release\npredict where we will\nstick to a habit or not.\nAnd in particular,\nwhether or not we will be able\nto form that habit quickly\nor not.\nNow, this is absolutely\ncritical to understand\nfor the following reason.\nAnother thing that you'll hear\nout there in the literature\nis that it takes 21 days to form a habit.\nSome people say 18, some people say 21,\nsome people say 30 days,\nsome people say 60 days.\nSo which one is it?\nDoes it depend on the habit\nthat one is trying to form?\nOr does it depend on the person\nthat's trying to form the habit?\nWell, it turns out\nthat there's excellent\npeer-reviewed data on this.\nThere's a study published in 2010,\nfirst author Lally, L A L L Y.\nThis study found that,\nfor the same habit to be formed,\nit can take anywhere from 18 days\nto as many as 254 days\nfor different individuals\nto form that habit.\nThe reason I bring this up,\nis that I always get asked,\n\"Is it true that it takes\n21 days to form a habit?\"\n\"Is it true that your nervous\nsystem changes in six days\"\n\"when you're doing something repeatedly?\"\nAnd the answer is, as I mentioned before,\nit's highly variable.\nWhat I didn't tell you actually,\nis what specific habit\nthey were looking at\nin that Lally study.\nAnd it's interesting that\nthe specific behavior\nwas a health-related behavior.\nThat's pretty relevant\nto our discussion here,\non the podcast.\nWhich was taking walks after dinner.\nThere's actually a really nice literature\nshowing that walks after a meal\ncan speed glucose clearance\nfrom the blood stream,\ncan be beneficial for\nnot just weight loss,\nbut cardiovascular health, et cetera.\nSo a walk after dinner seems\npretty straight-forward, right?\nWell, in order to form that habit,\nit took some people 18 days\nand other people 254 days.\nHow did they know when\nthey formed the habit?\nWell, they were doing\nit about 85% of the time\nand they also reported not having to spend\nthat much mental effort in\norder to get into to the mode\nof taking a walk after dinner.\nSo, for those of you listening,\nsome of you might be thinking,\n\"I can't believe that it would\ntake certain people 254 days\"\n\"to get into that habit.\"\nAs I said, people are highly variable\nand if you can't form one habit easily,\nit doesn't mean that you can't\nform other habits easily.\nThe mystery of why certain people\ncan form certain habits\nmore easily than others?\nProbably has something to\ndo with how people manage\nwhat's called limbic friction.\nNow, limbic friction is not a\nterm that you're going to find\nin the formal neurobiological literature\nor even some of the\npsychological literature.\nIt's, frankly, a term that I coined\nto encompass a number of different pieces\nof the psychology and\nneuroscience literature.\nLimbic friction is a short-hand way\nthat I use to describe\nthe strain that's required\nin order to overcome one of\ntwo states within your body.\nOne state is one of anxiousness,\nwhere you're really anxious\nand therefore you can't\ncalm down, you can't relax,\nand therefore you can't engage\nin some particular activity\nor thought pattern that you would like.\nThe other state is one in\nwhich you're feeling too tired\nor lazy or not motivated.\nBoth of those states, feeling too alert\nand too calm, if you will,\nrelate to the function\nof the so-called autonomic nervous system,\na set of neurons and hormones\nand chemicals in your brain\nand body that act as sort of a see-saw.\nYou're either alert or calm.\nYou're either asleep or stressed.\nThose two states are not\ncompatible with one another.\nYou've probably heard of \"wired and tired\"\nbut that's really once\nyou've been very stressed\nfor a long time, to the\npoint where you're exhausted.\nWhat does the autonomic\nnervous system have to do\nwith any of this?\nWell, limbic friction is a phrase\nthat can be used to\ndescribe how much effort,\nhow much activation energy you need\nin order to engage in\na particular behavior.\nSo, using this Lally study as an example,\nsome people would eat\ndinner, and then say,\n\"Oh, that's right, I've been\ntrying to develop the habit\"\n\"of taking a walk after dinner.\"\n\"So, let's get up and go.\"\nOther people will feel like,\n\"I just don't want to do it today.\"\nThey're going to feel\ntoo much limbic friction\nand that limbic friction\ncould arrive, again,\nfrom one of two sources.\nIt could be because they\nare too tired to do it\nor it could be because they're too anxious\nand distracted in order to do it.\nSo, this is a key distinction.\nA lot of habit formation has to do\nwith being in the right state of mind\nand being able to control\nyour state of body and mind.\nSo as we march forward,\nwhat you're going to\nfind is that this phrase\nor this term, limbic friction,\nis going to be a useful metric\nor a way for you to touch in with yourself\nand address whether or not you are likely\nto be able to form a certain habit easily\nor whether or not it's going\nto be very challenging.\nAnd I'm going to teach you a way\nto measure your degree of limbic friction.\nThat is, how much activation\nenergy it will take\nin order for you to execute a new habit.\nAnd I'm going to teach you\nhow to measure your limbic friction\nand activation energy for how likely it is\nthat you're going to be\nable to break a habit\nthat you don't want to have.\nThe other key concept for us to address\nthat's really mainly found in the books\nand articles out there about habits,\nis this notions of what\nI call linchpin habits.\nLinchpin habits are certain habits\nthat make a lot of other\nhabits easier to execute.\nNow, the sorts of linchpin habits\nthat I'm referring to are\nalways going to be things\nthat you enjoy doing.\nI'll just give you an\nexample from my life.\nI happen to like exercise.\nNot all forms of exercise,\nbut I happen to like resistance training\nand I happen to like running.\nSo I'm personally in the habit\nof getting cardiovascular\nexercise 3 or 4 times per week.\nMaybe 30-60 minutes per session.\nAnd I'm in the habit of\ndoing resistance training 3\nor 4 times per week,\ntypically also for about 45\nto 60 minutes per session.\nNow, I enjoy those,\nand for reasons that I'll\nget into a little bit later,\nI enjoy those activities\ntypically early in the day\nbecause of the neurochemistry\nand the various types\nof hormones, et cetera,\nthat are associates with\nperforming those activities.\nBut I really place those\nactivities under the umbrella\nof what I call linchpin habits.\nWhy? Because those\nparticular habits are easy\nto execute because I enjoy them.\nBut they also make a lot of\nother habits easier to execute.\nThings like being alert for work,\nthings like making sure\nthat I get good sleep the night before,\nthings like hydration,\nthings like making sure\nthat I eat the foods\nthat are better for me than\nsome of the other foods\nthat maybe I would more\nreflexively reach to\nif I weren't doing that training.\nSo certain habits act as linchpins,\nmeaning that they shift\na lot of other things.\nThey can control and\nbias the likelihood that,\nin this case you or me,\nwill perform other habits\nthat are harder to access,\nthat we have less of an affinity for.\nSo again,\nthere's three concepts that\nwe need to include here.\nWe've got identity-based\nversus goal-based habits.\nWe've got the concept that\ntypically different habits\ntake different periods of time to adopt,\ndepending on the person and the habit.\nAnd that there are these,\nwhat I call linchpin habits.\nCertain habits that make other\nhabits easier to execute.\nAnd those linchpin habits\nalways, always, always are\nthings that we enjoy doing.\nSo our goal throughout this\nepisode is for you to identify\nwhich habits are easy for you to perform,\nwhich ones are hard for you to perform,\nand which habits you want to break.\nIf you want to grab a pen\nand paper, you can do that.\nOr if you want to dictate\nsome of that into your phone,\nyou can.\nBut right now, actually,\nif you just want to think\nabout these concepts,\nyou can always go back later,\nI'll be sure to spell\nout a very specific way\nthat you can chart out a map\ntowards forming particular habits\nand breaking particular habits later on.\nWhat I'd like us to do at this point is\nto take that concepts of limbic friction\nand for you to ask yourself\nwhat habits you perform on a daily basis,\nand these could be things as basic\nas brushing your teeth before breakfast,\nor brushing your teeth after breakfast.\nIt could be, for instance,\nthat you get exercise\nor you get it at a particular time of day,\nor even that you take a\nparticular route to work, right?\nWe are very habitual\nand we tend to do things\nmore or less over and over\nin the same way, unless\nwe intervene in ourselves.\nThat's just the way that we are wired.\nSo now I'd like you to shift\nto thinking about a\nparticular aspect of habits\nand that's habit strength.\nNow, you all have different habits.\nYou probably brush your teeth\nat a particular time of day,\nyou probably exercise at\nparticular times of week,\nyou probably go to the refrigerator\nin a very habitual way.\nWe are incredibly habitual organisms.\nUnless we intervene in our habits,\nthey tend to carry out the\nsame way that they always have\nonce they've formed.\nSo you can do this exercise now,\nyou don't have to write this\ndown if you don't want to,\nbut you certainly are welcome.\nWe're going to evaluate\nwhat's called habit strength.\nThat's not a concept that I created.\nHabit strength is something\nthat you will find in the\npsychological literature.\nHabit strength is measured\nby two main criteria.\nThe first, is how\ncontext-dependent a give habit is.\nSo, context dependence is,\nif you go from one\nenvironment to the next,\ndo you tend to do the same thing,\nin the same way, at the same time of day?\nSo, for instance,\nbrushing your teeth firs\nthing in the morning.\nMaybe some of you do\nthat before breakfast,\nmaybe some of you do that later,\nmaybe some of you, like me,\ndon't even eat breakfast.\nBut when I travel, I tend\nto brush my teeth at more\nor less the same time of day\nrelative to when I wake up\nas I do when I'm at home.\nSo it's context independent.\nSo it's a very strong habit, right?\nThere are certain behaviors,\nlike perhaps what you eat,\nor, you know, perhaps how you dress,\nthat are context independent,\nthat you might perform\none way in one context,\nand another way in another context.\nThe other aspect of habit strength is\nhow much limbic friction is required\nto perform that habit on a regular basis.\nThis is extremely important\nbecause if you are in the\nprocess of building habits\nand consolidating those habits,\nthen it's probably going to\ntake more limbic friction\nto execute those habits.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, let's say you set out to get,\nlet's say 45 minutes of zone\nII cardio exercise every day,\n5 or maybe even 7 days a week.\nWell, if at first you're highly motivated,\nlimbic friction might be pretty low.\nLimbic friction is how much top-down,\nmeaning from your fore-brain\nto your limbic system,\nthe part of you brain that\ngenerates autonomic responses,\nhow much limbic friction,\nmeaning conscious over-ride\nof your state is required\nin order to engage in\nthat particular behavior.\nSo, if you're feeling particularly tired\nand you don't want to get out of bed,\nand you don't want to go out\nand do your zone II cardio,\nthen there's a high\ndegree of limbic friction.\nIt takes, some people\nthink of it as motivation,\nbut motivation is a\nbit of a vague concept,\nwhereas limbic friction involves\nspecific neural circuits\nand you can think of it in a\nmore or less quantitative way.\nYou can think of that\nyour body is very tired,\nso it's going to take more limbic friction\nin order to get into action.\nRight?\nYou're going to have to\novercome more limbic friction,\nexcuse me.\nWhereas if you're very, very alert,\nthere's less limbic friction\nbecause you're moving toward something\nthat's action oriented.\nHowever, the inverse is also true.\nLet's say that you are\ntrying to get into the habit,\nor you're in the early\nstages of forming a habit\nto meditate regularly.\nThat's a pretty quiescent\nor calming activity,\nso if you're somebody\nwho comes home from work\nand you're very anxious and\nyou have a lot of work to do\nand you have to deal\nwith a bunch of things,\nthere's a lot of limbic\nfriction to overcome\nin order to get into that calm state.\nSo these two aspects, context dependence,\nwhether or not you're like to do the thing\nregardless of where you are.\nRight? On travel, at home, on vacation,\nwith people around, not\npeople around, et cetera.\nAnd how much limbic friction is required\nto execute that habit,\nwill tell you whether or\nnot that habit is deeply\nor just shallowly embedded\nwithin your nervous system.\nThe goal of any habit that we want to form\nis to get into what's called automaticity.\nAutomaticity is fancy language\nfor the neural circuits can\nperform it automatically,\nand that's the ultimate place to be.\nAll right, if you have all these goals\nand things that you want to\nbe doing on a regular basis,\nyou'd love for them to be habitual\nbecause it takes less\nmental and physical effort,\nless limbic friction,\nin order to execute those.\nAnd so much of what's out there,\nagain in the popular\npsychology literature,\nin books that you'll find\non the bookstore shelf\nand on Amazon, and in the airports,\nare about how to get\nfrom that mode of high\ndegree of limbic friction\nto automaticity.\nAnd they offer a number of different ways,\nI think many of which are useful,\ntrying to get you to organize\ndifferent types of habits\ninto different bins, like\nvalue-based, and goal-based,\nand trying to persuade you\nthat structuring habits at\nthe particular times of day\nor in a particular way are\ngoing to be beneficial,\nand indeed, I think they\nhave helped a lot of people.\nSo what I'd like to do is to\ntake the scientific literature\nof how the nervous system learns\nand engages in plasticity,\nand apply that to habit formation,\nhabit maintenance, and if so desired,\nhow to break particular habits.\nI'd like to give you a particular tool\nthat's gleaned from the\nresearch psychology literature.\nI should mention that I learned about this\nfrom an excellent review article\nthat's available online.\nIt's called Psychology of Habit.\nThe authors are Wendy\nWood and Dennis Ruenger,\nthis is published in Annual\nReview of Psychology.\nThe Annual Reviews series is\na very high quality series.\nThere are annual reviews of neuroscience,\nannual reviews of psychology,\nannual reviews of nutrition\nscience, et cetera.\nFor those of you\nthat are interested in\nexploring review articles\nthat are grounded in hundreds of quality,\npeer-reviewed studies,\nthe Annual Review series\nis really terrific.\nCertainly among the best, if not the best.\nAnd they also tend to be quite\nlong and quite comprehensive.\nSo this review, Psychology\nof Habit by Wood\nand Ruenger, is excellent.\nAnd here I'm more or less\nparaphrasing from them,\nso I want to be clear that\nthese are their words, not mine.\nThey're talking about the various ways\nthat habits form in the nervous system\nand they mention, with\neach repetition of a habit,\nsmall changes occur in the\ncognitive and neural mechanisms\nassociated with procedural memory.\nSo I just want to talk for a second\nabout what procedural memory is.\nIn the neuroscience of memory,\nwe distinguish between\nwhat's called episodic memory\nand procedural memory.\nEpisodic memory is a recall\nof a particular set of events\nthat happened,\nwhereas procedural memory\nis holding in mind the\nspecific sequence of things\nthat need to happen\nin order for a particular\noutcome to occur.\nSo think of it like a\nrecipe or a protocol,\nor for the sake of exercise,\nit's like sets and reps,\nor a particular course that\nyou're going to run or cycle,\nor the number of laps you're going to swim\nand how you're going to perform it.\nIt's very clear that for anyone\ntrying to adopt new habits,\ngetting into the mindset of\nprocedural memory is very useful\nfor overcoming that barrier\nthat we call limbic friction.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, a simple visualization exercise,\nor it doesn't even have\nto be done eyes closed.\nYou know, often times we\nhear visualization exercise,\nyou think about sitting in a\nlotus position, eyes closed,\nyou know, trying really\nhard to visualize something.\nDoesn't need to be anything like that.\nIt can simply be, if you are\ndeciding to adopt a new habit,\nto just think about the very\nspecific sequence of steps\nthat's required to execute that habit.\nAnd I'll use a trivial example,\nbut this could be applied to anything.\nLet's say I want to get into\nthe habit of making myself,\nor someone else in my household,\na cup of espresso every morning,\nI would actually think\nthrough each of those steps.\nWalk into the kitchen, turn\non the espresso machine,\ndraw the espresso.\nWalking through each of those\nsteps, from start to finish,\nand it turns out just that\nsimple mental exercise done once\ncan shift people towards\na much higher likelihood\nof performing that habit regularly,\nnot just the first time,\nbut as they continue out into the days\nand weeks that follow.\nSo that's remarkable to me\nand the literature is really robust.\nJust one mental exercise\nof thinking through\nwhat are the sequence of steps required\nin order to perform this\nhabit from start to finish\ncan shift the likelihood of\nbeing able to perform that habit\nfrom unlikely or moderately likely,\nto very likely over time.\nAnd that's because it\npulls from this process\nthat involves our\nhippocampus and our neocortex\nand other areas of our\nbrain and nervous system,\nthat engage in procedural memory.\nIt shifts the brain towards\na mindset, if you will.\nIt's more of a neural circuit\nset, would be more accurate.\nBut a mindset/neural circuit set\nof doing things in a particular sequence,\nwhich allows that limbic\nfriction to come down\nand increases the likelihood\nthat we're going to perform that thing.\nSimple tool but very powerful too,\naccording to the psychology literature.\nAnd actually, the cellular\nand molecular mechanisms\nthat underlie that sort\nof procedural memory,\nstepping through phenomenon are known.\nIn this article I mentioned,\nthis beautiful review,\nthey talk about so\ncalled Hebbian learning.\nDonald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada\nand birthed this field\nthat has now lasted, gosh,\nmore than 50 years and\nis still very strong\nin neuroscience and psychology\nof Hebbian learning.\nHebbian learning is when\nparticular neurons are co-active,\nmeaning when they fire together,\nthey tend to strengthen their connections\nwith one another.\nAnd it has a number of different cellular\nand molecular features\nthat we don't have to go into in detail,\nbut for those of you that want to know,\nI know some of you are hungry\nfor a little bit more neuroscience,\nthis involves things like NMDA receptors\nand methyl-D-aspartate receptors.\nNMDA receptors are\nreally important I think\nfor everyone to understand.\nSo I'll just tell you a\nlittle bit about them.\nThese are receptors that\nare on the neuron's surface\nand normally they don't contribute much\nto the activity of those neurons.\nThose neurons are perfectly\ncapable of doing their thing\nwithout activation of this NMDA receptor.\nBut when a neuron gets\na very strong input,\na strong stimulus,\nthat NMDA receptor triggers\na number of mechanisms\nthat recruit\nto the surface of the\nneuron more other receptors.\nIn other words, it makes\nthat neuron more responsive\nto input in the future\nsuch that it doesn't\nrequire so much input.\nIn other words, it takes a neuron\nthat is very unlikely to fire\nand makes it more likely to fire.\nSo this procedural stepping through\nof the steps of the recipe\nor the series of actions\nsteps that are involved\nin sitting down to study\nand writing for an hour,\nor generating exercise,\nwhatever is the habit that\nyou're trying to learn.\nWhen you're doing that exercise,\nit's not as if your nervous system\nthinks you're actually\nperforming that behavior.\nYour nervous system isn't stupid.\nIt's actually a lot smarter than that.\nIt knows the difference between\na thought and an action,\nbut when you do that,\nit sets in motion the same neurons\nthat are going to be required\nfor the execution of that habit.\nAnd so when you actually show\nup to perform that habit,\nit's as if the dominoes fall more easily.\nIt's a lower threshold, as we say,\nin order to get the habit to perform.\nSo, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors,\nall that nuts and bolts stuff.\nReally the guts of the\nmechanisms of how this works.\nBut for those of you that just want\nto be more habitual about certain things,\nbe able to perform certain\nthings more reflexively,\nthat you would like in your life,\nsimply take the time,\ndo it once, maybe twice,\nand just sit down, close\nyour eyes if you like,\nand just step through the procedure\nof what it's going to take in\norder to perform that habit.\nThe psychology literature, as I mentioned,\nand also the neuroscience literature,\nstrongly supports the fact\nthat it is going to make it far easier\nfor you to adopt and maintain that habit.\nAnd if you are somebody who\nused to perform a habit,\nand you don't understand\nwhy you dropped it,\nand you're frustrated with yourself,\nand you're trying to figure out\nhow you can get back into that habit,\nwell by all means,\nlean right back into that habit,\nbut if you're having trouble doing that,\nalso just use the\nprocedural memory exercise\nin order to shift your nervous system\ntowards a higher likelihood\nthat you will return to that habit\njust the same way I described for trying\nto initiate a new habit.\nSo now I'd like to discuss a second,\nand what I think is perhaps\nthe most powerful tool\nfor being able to acquire\nand stick to new habits.\nThis tool is rooted in what\nwe call neural circuits\nand I do think it is important\nto understand a little bit\nabout how those neural circuits work.\nFor those of you that are saying,\n\"Just tell me what to do.\"\nI have to say, as I always say,\nunderstanding a little bit or\na lot of underlying mechanism\nwill help solidify these concepts for you\nand will help ensure that the tools\nthat I offer are going to make sense\nand that they're going\nto make sense in differing contexts\nand for different types of habits\nthat you're tying to learn.\nSo, rather than just tell you what to do,\nI'm going to tell you how\nthis particular tool works,\nand then in doing that,\nyou should be able to\napply it to any habit,\nunder any conditions.\nThe tool that I'm referring to\nis something called task-bracketing\nand the neural circuits\nassociated with task-bracketing\nare basically the neural circuits\nthat are going to allow you\nto learn any new type of habit\nor break any habit that\nyou'd like to break.\nWe have in our brain a\nset of neural circuits\nthat fall under the umbrella\nterm of the basal ganglia.\nThe basal ganglia are\ninvolved in action execution,\nmeaning doing certain things,\nand action suppression,\nnot doing certain things.\nIn the experimental realm,\nthese are referred to as go, meaning do,\nor no go, don't do, certain things.\nAnd some of us fall more into the category\nof we find it very easy\nto do certain things,\nbut harder to not do other things.\nSome people have a lot\nof no go type circuits\nthat are very robust,\nand they have a lot of\nbehavioral constraint,\nbut they have a harder\ntime getting into action.\nAnd some people have a\nperfect balance of both,\nbut I've never met one of those people.\nSo again, drawing from,\nmore or less paraphrasing\nfrom this beautiful review\nthat I described earlier\nin Annual Review of Psychology, excuse me,\nby Wood and Ruenger,\ntask-bracketing involves a\nparticular set of neural circuits\nwithin the basal ganglia,\nso I'm going to describe this\nhere, again paraphrasing,\na sensory-motor loop.\nSensory means just input\ncoming in about sight, sounds,\ntaste, et cetera.\nAnd then the motor systems,\nthe systems of the brain and\nbody that generate action,\ntaking that information\nand generating action.\nSo it turns out that there's\nan area of our basal ganglia\ncalled the dorsolateral striatum,\nwe can use the acronym DLS.\nAgain, dorsolateral striatum.\nDorso means up. Lateral means to the side.\nSo dorsolateral.\nAnd striatum is a subdivision\nof the basal ganglia.\nAnd it's very important\nfor the establishment of behaviors\nthat are associated with a habit,\nbut not necessarily the habit itself.\nAnd beautiful studies in\nboth animals and humans\nthat record the activity in\nthe dorsolateral striatum\nfind that the dorsolateral\nstriatum is associated,\nmeaning it becomes active at the beginning\nof a particular habit,\nand at the very end and\nafter a particular habit.\nHence the phrase task-bracketing.\nIt brackets the habit.\nNow, other sets of neurons\nare going to be active\nduring the actual execution of the habit,\nbut what the literature on\nthe dorsolateral striatum\ntells us is that we have\nparticular circuits in our brain\nthat are devoted to framing the events\nthat happened just before\nand as we initiate a habit,\nand just after and as\nwe terminate a habit.\nIn other words, it acts\nas a sort of marker\nfor the habit execution,\nbut not the execution of the habit per se.\nThis is very important\nbecause task-bracketing\nis what underlies whether\nor not a habit will be\ncontext dependent or not,\nwhether or not it will be strong\nand likely to occur\neven if we didn't get good\nnight's sleep the night before,\neven if we're feeling distracted,\neven if we're not feeling like\ndoing something emotionally,\nor if we are, you know,\ncompletely overwhelmed\nby other events.\nIf the neural circuits\nare task bracketing,\nare deeply embedded in us,\nmeaning they are very robust\naround a particular habit,\nwell then it's likely\nthat we're going to go out\nfor that zone II cardio no matter what,\nthat we're going to brush\nour teeth no matter what.\nI'm fact, brushing our teeth\nis a pretty good example\nbecause, for most people,\neven if you got a terrible night's sleep,\neven If everything in\nyour life is going wrong,\nchances are, unless you're very depressed,\nif you're going to leave to work,\nor even if you're not,\nthat you're going to still\ncarry out the behavior\nof brushing your teeth in the morning.\nI would hope so, actually.\nBut you are probably less likely\nto perform particular habits\nthat are not what you deem as necessary.\nBut if you think about it,\nbrushing your teeth, exercise,\neating particular foods,\nmaybe engaging socially\nin particular ways,\nyou are the one that places\nany kind of value assessment\non which ones are essential,\nand which ones are negotiable.\nSo task-bracketing sets a neural imprint,\na kind of a finger print in your brain,\nof this thing has to happen\nat this particular time of day\nso much so that it's reflexive.\nAnd as we'll talk about in a moment,\nthere's a way that you can\nbuild up task-bracketing\nso that regardless of what\nit is you're trying to learn,\nthere's a much higher probability\nthat you're going to do that thing.\nAnd when I say learn,\nmeaning let's say you're\ntrying to acquire a habit\nthat for you is really challenging.\nMaybe it's that you're going\nto write for an hour a day\non a book project that\nyou've been thinking about\nor you're going to work on mathematics,\nor you're going to do any sort of thing\nthat for you there's a\nlot of limbic friction.\nWhile it is important to think\nabout the sequence of events\nthat would be required in order\nto engage in that behavior,\nthat procedural memory\nvisualization exercise\nwe talked about before, that will help,\nthere's a way also that you\ncan orient your nervous system\ntowards this task-bracketing process,\nso that your nervous system is shifted\nor oriented towards the\nexecution of a given habit.\nSo this is sort of like warming\nup your body to exercise.\nWhen the dorsolateral striatum is engaged,\nyour body and you brain are\nprimed to execute a habit\nand that you get to consciously insert\nwhich habit you want to perform.\nSo in order to leverage\nthe neural mechanisms\nof task-bracketing,\nin order to increase the likelihood\nthat you're going to\nperform a particular habit,\nI have to break it to you\nthat one thing that you've\nprobably heard over and over\nabout habit formation\nis not true.\nAnd what I'm referring to is this idea\nthat if you're very specific\nabout exactly when you're going\nto perform a particular habit,\nthat you're more likely\nto perform that habit.\nAnd while that is true in the short term,\nit is not true in the long term.\nAnd the reason for that is\nthat our nervous system tends\nto generate particular kinds of behavior\nbased not on time, but on our state.\nMeaning what level of\nactivation is taking place\nin our brain and body.\nHow much focus we happen to have,\nhow fatigued we are, how energized we are.\nSo while schedules are important,\nit's not the particular time of day per se\nthat's going to allow\nyou to get into a habit,\nand form that habit, and\nconsolidate that habit.\nRather, it's the state that your brain\nand body are in that's\nimportant to anchor yourself to.\nSo now I'm going to offer you a tool.\nIt's actually an entire program\nby which you can insert\nparticular habits and activities\nat particular phases of the day,\nnot times of day, but phases of the day,\nbecause it turns out that\nparticular phases of the day\nare associated with particular\nbiological underpinnings,\nchemicals and neural\ncircuits and so forth,\nand in doing so it will\nmake it far more likely\nthat you will be able to\nregularly engage in these habits\nand activities over a long period of time.\nAnd whether or not that\nwill move you from somebody\nwho ordinarily would take\n200 days to form a habit\nto one of those 18 days to habit people\nin that earlier study I\nmentioned, I don't know.\nBut I am certain that will\nhave a significant shift\non allowing you to engage in\nparticular habits more easily\nand to consolidate those\nhabits more quickly.\nSo the program I am about to describe,\nI formulated for you based on\nthe neuroscience literature,\nand the psychology literature of learning,\nand this concepts of task-bracketing.\nIt involves the 24 hour days\ninto what I call three phases.\nThe first is phase one,\nwhich is 0 to 8 hours after\nwaking up, approximately.\nOkay, you can put a plus\nor minus 30 minutes on this\nfor yourself.\nThe second phase is the\n9 to 14, maybe 15 hours\nafter you wake up.\nAnd the third phase is 16\nto 24 hours after waking up.\nSo we've taken the 24 hour cycle,\nwe've carved it up into three phases,\nphase one, phase two, and phase three.\nNow, everything I'm describing,\nor at least the way I'm\ngoing to describe it,\nis based on what I would\ncall a typical schedule,\ndiurnal schedule.\nYou've heard of nocturnal?\nWell, we are diurnal.\nMost of us are asleep at night\nand awake during the day.\nI do realize that a number\nof people have shift work\nor they have newborns or other reasons\nwhy they have to be up in\nthe middle of the night\nand sleeping during the day.\nIf that's the case,\nplease listen to the\nepisode we did on jet-lag\nand shift work because\nthat has a lot of tools\nspecifically for that population.\nBut most people go to sleep\nsomewhere around 10:00 PM,\nplus or minus two hours,\nand wake up some time around 7:00 AM,\nplus or minus two hours.\nSo today, I'm going to\nuse the to bed at 10:00 PM\nand a wake up time of 7:00\nAM as the framework for this,\nbut you could adopt it easily\nto your particular schedule.\nPhase one, which again, is\n0 to 8 hours after waking,\nhas a particular neurochemical signature.\nRegardless of what you do,\nthe neuromodulators norepinephrine\nas well as epinephrine,\nso that's noradrenaline and adrenaline,\nas well as the neuromodulator dopamine\ntend to be elevated during\nthat first 0 to 8 hours\nafter waking.\nThere are a number of reasons\nfor this related to the fact\nthat also cortisol is higher\nin our brain and bloodstream,\nit's a healthy level of\ncortisol upon waking,\nbody temperature is increased, et cetera.\nAnd there's several things\nthat perhaps we should all be doing,\nI've talked about many of\nthese on the podcast before,\nthat in addition to those chemicals,\nfurther support an\nalert and focused state.\nAnd I'll just list those off.\nI've done many podcasts on each of these\nif you'd like to access those\npodcasts you can find them\nin the menu of podcasts on YouTube,\nApple, Spotify, et cetera.\nThey involve, for instance,\nviewing sunlight or\nbright artificial light\nif you can't access sunlight,\nwithin the first 30 minutes of waking.\nPhysical exercise of some kind\nin this phase of the day,\n0 to 8 hours of the day,\nideally pretty early in that phase,\nbut, you know,\nif it has to be at the 7\nto 8 hour transition point\nthat's fine too.\nCold exposure in the form\nof cold showers or ice baths\nor outside with minimal clothing,\nappropriate yet minimal clothing.\nCaffeine ingestion.\nFasting, for instance,\nnot ingesting calories,\nalso will lend itself to\nincreased norepinephrine\nand dopamine, et cetera.\nIf you are going to consume foods,\nfoods that are rich in\nthings like tyrosine,\nwhich is a precursor for dopamine.\nYou can look up foods\nthat are high in tyrosine.\nAnd for those of you that are\ninterested in supplementation\nand like to use those routes,\nthings like alpha GPC or\nphenylethylamine, think,\nor L-tyrosine,\nif that's in keeping with\nwhat you're able to do.\nOf course, consult your doctor\nif you're going to rely\non supplementation.\nWhat's this all about?\nWell, the already elevated norepinephrine\nand dopamine, the sunlight, exercise,\ncold exposure, caffeine,\ntyrosine, et cetera,\nall of those place the\nbrain and body into a state\nin which you are better able,\nor I would say, more easily able,\nto engage in activities\nthat have a high degree limbic friction\nand where you need to\noverride that limbic friction.\nRight? We've heard that the\nmorning is kind of sacred,\nconquer the hardest things\nfirst thing in the morning,\nand that's been discussed in\nthe pop psychology literature\nand in the habit formation literature\nmerely from the perspective of\nget it out of the way so you can feel good\nabout having done it.\nBut what I'm referring\nto is quite different.\nWhat I'm referring to is\na particular phase of day\nthat after rising, after\nwaking up, that is,\nfor 0 to 8 hours, right,\nin that first phase,\nyour whole system is\naction and focus oriented.\nAnd we know that when you're\naction and focus oriented\nand because of the neurochemicals\nthat are naturally released\nin your brain and body\nthat you will be more likely\nto overcome any limbic friction\nthat stands in the way of\nperforming particular habits.\nSo, as you list out or think\nabout the various habits\nthat you'd like to adopt in\nyour life, take the habits\nfor which you know\nthere's the highest degree\nof limbic friction,\nthey are the hardest for you to engage in,\nthey require the most activation energy,\nand put those in this 0\nto 8 hours after waking.\nThis will greatly\nfacilitate your performance\nof those new habits.\nI'm certain of that.\nAnd in addition to that,\nby doing them in this\nparticular phase of the day,\nnot necessarily the same time,\nI mean, if you want to be very habitual,\nand you want to do,\nyou know, the exercise,\nor the sunlight viewing\nalways at the same time,\nor you want to do,\nyou want to drink your caffeine\nalways at the exact\nsame time, that's fine,\nbut by placing them in this broader window\nof 0 to 8 hours after waking,\nwhat you're doing is you're\ncreating task-bracketing.\nYou're making it such\nthat your nervous system\nwill predict when you are going to lean in\nagainst limbic friction\nin order to perform\nparticular types of habits.\nAnd this is very different than saying,\n\"I'm always going to run\" or,\n\"I'm always going to study from\n10 to 12 AM every morning.\"\nThat's great, and if you\ncan do that, terrific.\nBut the literature indicates\nthat people who do that,\nwho are very rigid about\nwhen they do things tend,\nbecause of context dependence,\nto not necessarily stick\nto those habits over time.\nSome people do, but\nmany, many people don't.\nSo think about the hardest habits to form\nand the habits that you most want to form\nthat are hardest for you\nto adopt and to maintain\nand I highly suggest\nplacing those somewhere\nwithin this phase one of\n0 to 8 hours after waking.\nNow of course, some of\nthe things I listed out,\nsunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure,\ncaffeine, fasting,\nthose might be the\nactual habits themselves,\nbut here I realize, or\nrather I want to acknowledge\nthat many people, including myself,\nare doing some or all\nof these things already\nand many people, including myself,\nare trying to adopt new habits\nthat don't fall into the category\nof just trying to set your overall state.\nAgain, norepinephrine, dopamine,\nand all these neural systems\nwill be greatly elevated in\nthis 0 to 8 hours after waking.\nHowever, the other things I mentioned,\nsunlight exposure,\nexercise, cold exposure,\ncaffeine, fasting, if that's for you,\nor if you're eating during that phase,\neating things that contain some\nor elevated levels of tyrosine,\nmaybe supplementing alpha\nGPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera.\nAll of those things further\nfacilitate the neurochemistry\nand therefore the state of mind\nthat's going to be ideal for\nleaning into limbic friction\nand overriding that limbic friction\nso that you can regularly\nperform that habit.\nWhat we're really talking about here\nis leveraging neural systems\nin order to help you make it more likely\nthat you're going to be able to engage\nand maintain a particular habit.\nSo what I'm referring to as\nphase one of each day is useful\nfor acquiring certain habits,\nbut there are other phases of the day,\nand those turn out to be useful\nfor acquiring other types of habits.\nPhase two, as I mentioned, is about,\nagain these aren't specifics,\nbut about 9 to 14 or\n15 hours after waking.\nDuring this phase of the day,\nbecause of the circadian\nshifts in our biology,\nthe amount of dopamine and norepinephrine\nthat's circulating in our brain\nand bloodstream tends\nto start to come down\nand levels of cortisol\ntend to start to come down.\nThat's the ideal circumstance.\nIn fact,\nyou don't really want elevated\ncortisol late in the day.\nThat's actually a signature of depression\nand anxiety and a number of\nother unfortunate things.\nSo, 9 to 14 hours after waking dopamine\nand norepinephrine and cortisol\nare starting to taper down,\njust naturally.\nAnd a different neuromodulator, serotonin,\nis starting to rise.\nSerotonin is definitely\ngoing to be highest\nin this second half of the day\nand tends to lend itself to a\nmore relaxed state of being.\nNow of course,\nI do realize that some people\nare less of morning people\nand do find that they really come alive\nand awake in the afternoon,\nbut most people don't\nfall into that category.\nMost people feel more\nalert early in the day,\neven anxious early in the day,\nand then, as the afternoon progresses,\nthey tend to be a bit more\nsleepy, a bit more relaxed,\na bit more calm.\nThere's certain things that we all can\nand should do during this\nphase two of each day\nthat lend themselves to a state of mind\nand a state of body that\nis going to be beneficial\nfor the generation and consolidation\nof certain types of habits.\nWhat are those things?\nFirst of all, as the day goes on,\nyou should try if you can\nto start tapering the amount\nof light that you're viewing.\nNow, this doesn't mean putting yourself\ninto dim light at 3 o'clock\n4 o'clock in the afternoon.\nThat's certainly not the case.\nSimply that you want to\nstart tapering off the amount\nof really bright light\nthat you're getting,\nunless it's sunlight.\nTalked about this before on the podcast,\nbut if you haven't heard,\nviewing the sun as it's at\nwhat we call low solar angle\nso it's headed toward the horizon,\nyou don't necessarily\nhave to watch the sunset,\nalthough that can be nice.\nBut getting some sun light in your eyes\nin the second half of the\nday can also be beneficial\nfor a number of brain systems\nand psychological systems\nso you can get some\nsome light in your eyes,\nyou can certainly have\nartificial lights on,\nbut you want to start dimming those lights\nand bringing them actually\nphysically lower in the room\nbecause the neurons in your eye\nthat view the upper visual field\nthey actually trigger\nthis alertness mechanism\nin the brain and body.\nAnd in the second half of the day,\neven if you're humming\naround and doing work at 3\nor 4 or 5 or even 7 PM,\nyou are probably headed toward\nsleep a few hours later,\nso things like limiting\nthe total amount of light\nif you can,\nthings like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,\nanother thing that I've\ntalked about on this podcast.\nIf you haven't heard about this before,\nnon-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term\nfor things like\nmeditation, for Yoga Nidra,\na very powerful science supported tool\nfor teaching you how to relax,\nthings like self-hypnosis\nwhich might sound a little\nkooky to some of you,\nbut actually is a clinically based tool\nfor which there's a lot\nof scientific literature.\nIf you're interested in that\nthere's a great free\nresource called Reverie,\nR E V E R I E .com.\nThere's a app for both Apple and Android.\nThis is an app that was\ndeveloped by colleagues of mine\nand researchers at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine.\nYou can do these short\n15 self hypnosis script,\nas they're called.\nThey can teach you how to relax yourself,\nthere's even one for focus,\nfor sleep, for chronic pain,\nAgain, all very strongly supported\nby quality peer-reviewed literature.\nSo things like Reverie, meditation,\nthings like heat and sauna,\nhot baths, hot showers.\nThose are terrific things\nto do in the second half\nof the day,\nthey tend to support this serotonergic,\nor high serotonin like state\nand lend themselves to\nmore calm and relaxation.\nFor those that are interested\nin supplementation,\nthere's always ashwagandha,\nwhich reduces cortisol,\nagain peaks in cortisol\nlate in the afternoon\nand evening are associated\nwith depression,\nanxiety, and so forth.\nAshwagandha has a pretty potent\ncortisol inhibiting tool.\nI personally don't use it very often\nand I caution people about using it\nfor longer than two-week periods of time\nwithout taking some breaks.\nYou can look up more about\nashwagandha on examine.com.\nThere's a lot of traffic literature\nwith links to studies there.\nBut basically this phase two of the day\nis one in which you're\nalert, you are present\nyou are working, you\nare engaging socially,\nyou're cooking dinner probably,\npaying attention to a number of things,\nbut you should really be trying\nto taper off your stress level.\nSo how do you leverage\nphase two of the day\nfor habit formation?\nWell, given what we know\nabout the neurochemistry\nof learning and memory,\ngiven what we know about task formation\nand its reliance on certain\nforms of neuroplasticity,\nthe second half of the\nday is a terrific time\nto take on habits and things\nthat you're already doing\nthat require very little\noverride of limbic friction.\nSo these might be things that\ncategorize in common terms\nas kind of mellower activities.\nIt might be journaling,\nit might be that you\nalready are performing music\nor I should say,\npracticing music regularly,\nbut there's a particular type of music\nthat is hard for you\nor that you're working on a\nparticular piece of music,\nor you're trying to learn a language.\nSomething that's a little bit challenging,\nbut doesn't require a ton of energy\nin order to override that limbic friction.\nThe second half of the day is\na much better time to do that.\nLess resistance, as we might say.\nBut of course, resistance\nhas a neural substrate\nand the reason for doing those things\nin the second part of the\nday, the so-called phase two,\nas I've called it, part of the day is\nbecause your ability\nto override resistance\nis really diminished\nin this second phase of the day.\nSome of you might say,\n\"Whoa wait,\"\n\"I like to exercise in the\nsecond half of the day.\"\n\"That's actually when I\nhave the most energy.\"\n\"That's when I feel warmer\"\n\"I'm not a morning exerciser.\"\nThat's absolutely fine,\nbut what I'm referring\nto is the acquisition\nof new behaviors\nand placing those consistently\nat the second half of the day\nin order to engage these\ntask-bracketing mechanisms\nthat I talked about before.\nOne of the hallmark features\nof those basal ganglia circuits for go\nand no-go is that they are associated\nwith certain neurochemicals,\ndopamine and serotonin,\nacetylcholine, and other neurochemicals.\nAnd by placing particular habits\nat particular phases of the day,\nthose neurochemical states\nstart to be associated\nwith the leaning in and\nthe process of beginning,\nand as I mentioned, ending\nthose particular habits.\nAnd in doing so they shift\nthe whole nervous system\ntoward being able to predict\nthat certain things are going to happen\nat particular times a day,\nthat you're going to be leaning very hard\nagainst limbic friction early\nin the day in phase one,\nand that you're going to be doing things\nthat require less conscious\noverride of limbic friction\nin phase two.\nAnd in doing so, set up\ntask-bracketing system\nso that the individual\nhabits that you're learning\nor that you're trying to learn\nhave a much greater\nprobability of being executed\nand consolidated,\nmeaning that pretty soon that they\nwill just naturally become reflexive.\nAnd as with phase one, many\nof the things that I mentioned\nthat support this, what I'm\ncalling a serotonergic state\nor more relaxed state in phase two,\nthings like seeing\nsunlight in the afternoon,\nbut not a lot of bright light\nfrom artificial sources,\nthings like NSDR,\nthings like heat and sauna,\nhot baths et cetera, ashwagandha,\nagain all of those things\nthemselves could be habits\nthat you're trying to adopt, right?\nIn that case, do those if\nyou'd like to explore them.\nThey are quite beneficial\nfor a number of reasons,\nnot just related to execution\nof particular habits\nin phase two of the day,\nbut also for improving quality of sleep\nand consolidating any learning\nthat you might have\ntriggered earlier in the day.\nI've talked about that before,\nbut just briefly, as a relevant aside,\nneuroplasticity involves\ntriggering the neural plasticity,\nsetting it in motion,\nbut the actual rewiring of the brain\nand the reconfiguration of neurons\nthat will allow that\nlearning to be reflexive,\nthat actually occurs\nduring states of deep rest,\nlike an NSDR and like deep sleep.\nAnd I should just mention,\nfor those of you that can only exercise\nor prefer to exercise in\nphase two of the day, right,\n9 to 14 hours or 15 hours after waking,\nthat's absolutely fine.\nHowever, because of\nthe importance of sleep\nand in particular deep\nsleep throughout the night\nfor not just neuroplasticity,\nbut recovery of muscle and other tissues\nthat are taxed during physical exercise,\nif you do train in phase two,\nI highly recommend, highly recommend\nthat you start doing some\nNSDR activity after you train,\nwithin an hour or two,\nbecause that will allow\nyou to taper down and relax\nso that you can get into\nthe next phase we're going\nto talk about, which is phase three.\nPhase three of the 24-hour schedule runs\nfrom about 16 to 24 hours after waking.\nDuring that period of time,\nthere are few things\nthat are going to support\nbeing in a state of mind,\nstate of body that are going\nto allow neuroplasticity\nto occur, that are going\nto allow the rewiring\nthat you've triggered during\nthe waking part of the day\nto actually take place.\nThose things are very low to no light,\nmeaning keeping your environment very dark\nor very, very dim.\nI don't think it's\nnecessary to sleep in a room\nthat's complete blackness.\nI think that's a little bit overkill,\nbut for most people keeping the room dark\nand keeping the room temperature\nlow is very beneficial\nfor getting and staying in deep sleep.\nThe body has to drop\nby about 1 to 3 degrees\nin order to get into\nsleep and stay asleep,\nso low light, low temperature environment,\nyou can always pile on blankets of course\nif you don't want to be cold at night,\nyou want to be warm enough,\nbut you want your environment to be cold.\nTypically people aren't eating\nin the middle of the night,\nalthough one thing that can\nbe useful is to make sure\nthat you're at least well-fed enough\nwhen you head into this third\nphase of every 24-hour day\nthat you're not awake\nbecause you're hungry.\nA lot of people recommend putting a gap\nbetween your final bite of food\nand when you got to sleep at night.\nSome people say that\ngap should be 4 hours,\nother people say 2 hours,\nif you're me, I generally\nhave something, I don't know,\nwithin 2 hours or 90\nminutes of going to sleep,\nbut it's not a big meal,\nbut that's just me,\nand I fall asleep and stay\nasleep fine with that.\nYou have to experiment for yourself.\nI've talked about supplements\nthat can support sleep in\nprevious episode of the podcast,\nthings like magnesium threonate,\nor magnesium bisglycinate,\nthings like theonine, apigenin.\nIf you'd like to read more about those,\nwe actually have a newsletter\nthat I'll just quickly refer you to\nthis is the Huberman Lab\nNeural Network Newsletter,\nyou can sign up for it by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com,\nit's very easy to find,\nbut even if you don't sign up,\nyou can go to the toolkit\nfor sleep that's listed there\nand that tool kit is not just supplements,\nthat tool kit is a number\nof different things,\nboth behavioral and supplement-based\nand nutrition-based, et cetera,\nthat can allow you to get in to sleep\nand to stay asleep more readily.\nIt's totally zero cost,\nyou can find that again\nat hubermanlab.com.\nSo things like low light, low temperature,\nthe supplements I mentioned,\nadjusting your eating\nschedule appropriately,\nobviously not drinking caffeine\nin the middle of the night\nor too close to bed,\nthat's going to be critical.\nIn fact, ideally you\nwouldn't ingest any caffeine\nin phase two of the day,\nso that you could get into\nthis deeper state of rest\nin which habit formation and\nneural plasticity can occur.\nWhat if you wake up?\nThe way I've cast phase three is\nthat you're supposed to\nbe in this deep slumber,\nyou're not supposed to wake up at all,\nyou're supposed to be in low light\nand your brain is rewiring\nand those habits are getting\nconsolidated, et cetera.\nWell, if you're like me,\nyou probably get up once\nin the middle of the night.\nMaybe go use the restroom.\nPerfectly normal, perfectly normal,\nbut a lot of people have\ntrouble falling back asleep.\nVery important if you get up\nin the middle of the night\nto use a minimum of light\nin order to navigate your surroundings,\njust as much as you need\nin order to safely do so,\nbecause light inhibits hormone melatonin,\ncan make it very hard\nto fall back to sleep\nif you inhibit melatonin.\nThe effects of light inhibiting melatonin\nare actually very potent.\nIt happens very, very quickly,\nso try and keep the lights low.\nAnd you have trouble falling back asleep,\nthat's when you might\nalso want to use something\nlike a Reverie app,\nthey have a sleep script there\nthat can hopefully help\nyou get back to sleep.\nOr something like NSDR,\nyou can find NSDR scripts on YouTube.\nThese are zero cost.\nYou can look up one\nthat I particularly like is NSDR Madefor.\nIt's a company I'm associated with,\nbut the NSDR is completely zero cost,\nand there are other things,\nlike Yoga Nidra, which you can\nfind scripts for elsewhere.\nAgain, all of these\nhabits or these behaviors,\nthese do's and don'ts around phase three,\nthemselves might be habits\nthat you're trying to create for yourself.\nBut again, phase three is\nreally about making sure\nthat whatever limbic\nfriction you've been able\nto override in phase one\nand trigger some new habit, right?\nForcing yourself to write\nor forcing yourself to study\nor forcing yourself to exercise\nduring that high limbic friction state.\nAnd then whatever things\nyou've been doing in phase two,\nwhich are habits\nthat hopefully have moved\na little bit further\nalong the continuum of newly-formed\nversus all the way to reflexive,\nor things that take less limbic\nfriction in in order to do.\nPhase three is when all\nof that gets really locked\ninto the nervous system\nthrough those Hebbian mechanisms,\nlike NMDA receptors, et cetera,\nthat I talked about before.\nAgain, neuroplasticity is\nthe basis of habit formation\nand neuroplasticity and the\nrewiring of neural circuits\nhappens in these states of deep sleep.\nSo if you're not obeying this phase three,\nif you're not giving phase\nthree the material it needs,\nand you're and you're not\navoiding the certain things,\nlike caffeine and bright light\nand stress during phase 3,\nyou're simply not going to\nbe able to build those habits\nthat you've been working so\nhard to trigger in phase one\nand phase two of the day.\nAgain, these are things\nthat I've talked about previous\nepisodes of the podcast\nand elsewhere, but really\nthis is about habit formation.\nAnd the whole reason\nfor placing particular types of behaviors\nat particular phases of the\nday is to set a framework\nfor that task-bracketing.\nAgain, task-bracketing\nand the circuits of the basal ganglia\nindicate that it's not\njust the neural circuits\nthat are engaged by the task itself,\nbut the neural circuits\nthat are engaged before\nand after that task execution.\nThat's what gets consolidated.\nSo when you do things that\nparticular phases of the day,\nunder particular conditions\nof neurochemistry,\nwhat you're doing is\nyou're giving the brain a very\npredictable set of sequences\nthat during sleep it can start\nto put into your hard drive,\nif you will.\nIt can really program it\ninto your nervous system,\nso that within a short period of time,\nhopefully within 18 or maybe even 6 days\nor who knows? Maybe even fewer days,\nyou'll find that executing\nthose behaviors is very,\nvery straightforward for you\nand that you won't have to\nfeel so much limbic friction\nor override so much limbic friction.\nSome of you are probably asking, okay,\nif I perform a particular\nhabit during phase one,\nand then I do other\nhabits during phase two,\nand I eventually get to the point\nwhere I'm engaging in those habits\nin a pretty effortless way,\ndo I keep them in the\nsame phase of the day?\nAnd the good news is, the\nliterature says it doesn't matter.\nAnd in fact,\nmoving that particular habit\naround somewhat randomly\ncan actually be beneficial to you\nbecause actually moving\nit from one time a day\nto the other is that context independence\nthat we really are seeking.\nBy being able to do the same\nthing that we want to do\nregardless of time of day or circumstances\nthat's how we know\nthat we've achieved a\nreal habit formation,\nthat's how we know that\nthe habit has been moved\ninto certain components\nof our neural circuity\nthat just allow us to do it\nwhat seems like reflexively.\nAlthough earlier I pointed out\nthat these aren't reflexes\nin the traditional sense.\nThe reason for that is\nthat this brain area,\nthe hippocampus, that many\nof you know is associated\nwith learning and memory,\nis not actually where memories are stored.\nThe hippocampus is where\nmemories are formed,\nit's where procedures, like\nwe talked about before,\nprocedural memory of how you're going\nto execute a particular sequence,\nwhere that's maintained.\nSo like if we use the recipe model,\nthat's where the recipe is maintained\nuntil you know how to cook that dish\nand then the procedural\nmemory literally migrates off\ninto a different set of neural circuits,\nwhich are the neural\ncircuits of the neocortex\nwhere we have maps of sensory experience,\nmaps of all kinds experiences,\nincluding motor maps of\nhow to execute things.\nSo we use one part of the\nbrain to learn something,\nbut then that information,\nin the form of the electrical\nactivity of neurons,\nis passed off to a different brain area.\nNow, the neurons themselves don't move\nfrom the hippocampus to the cortex,\nthat doesn't happen.\nWhat happens is the signals,\nthe sequence of electrical firing,\nmuch like a script for a movie\nor the notes on a sheet of paper\nfor a particular musical piece\nis transferred off to\na different brain area.\nSo, that whole process\nof really leaning into\nsomething that's hard,\nand then it becoming easier,\nand then eventually that\nthings becoming more\nor less reflexive involves a migration\nof the information in the brain.\nAnd once it's migrated out\nto a different location in the brain,\nat that point it's achieved\ncontext-independence.\nIt doesn't have to be\nbracketed by, you know,\nyour caffeine and your lunch.\nIt doesn't have to occur immediately\nafter your afternoon NSDR,\nbut before your four\nO'clock meeting on Zoom,\nor something of that sort.\nSo all this is to say\nthat once something has become reflexive,\nyou should play with it a\nlittle bit about time of day.\nIf you want to keep it in\nthe same phase of day, great.\nBut if you one day decide\nyou're going to exercise in the afternoon,\nthe next day you decide\nyou're going to exercise in the morning,\nand that's the habit that\nyou're concerned with,\nthat's terrific.\nIf you're able to do that, that means\nthat it's truly achieved\ncontext-independence.\nIt means that you have\nofficially formed that habit.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nmuch earlier at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nthe strength of a habit is dictated by\nhow much limbic friction, that was one,\nand how much context dependence there is.\nSo when it doesn't take\nmuch activation energy\nto get into the execution of that habit\nand you can do it in any context, well,\nthen you have formed a habit.\nWe really can't have a discussion\nabout learning anything,\nhabits or otherwise,\nunless we talk about\nreward prediction error.\nReward prediction error is associated\nwith the molecule dopamine,\nalthough I should say there\nare other neurochemicals\nin our brain and body\nthat are also related to\nreward prediction error.\nBut reward prediction error\nis a very good system,\nor I should say, a lens\nthrough which to think about,\nwhether or not we should reward ourselves\nfor performing a given habit.\nAnd this is a much larger discussion\nthat actually relates\nto things like parenting\nand self-regulation.\nYou know, should we reward\nkids just for effort?\nShould we reward\nourselves just for effort?\nWhat should we reward?\nHow much should we reward ourselves?\nWhen should we withdraw reward?\nShould we use punishment?\nThese kinds of things.\nThis is a vast literature.\nWe don't have time to\ngo into all the details,\nbut the notion of reward\nprediction error is so powerful\nthat it can predict most\nif not all forms of learning,\nincluding habit formation.\nAnd you can deploy or\nuse particular features\nof reward prediction error\nif you would like to reinforce\nor accelerate the formation\nof certain habits.\nSo, reward prediction\nerror, quite simply, is\nif you expect a reward\nand the reward comes,\na particular behavior that was associated\nwith generating that reward is more likely\nto occur again.\nThat's pretty straight forward.\nHowever, the amount of reward,\nin the form of this molecule dopamine,\nthat you will experience is even greater\nif a reward arrives\nthat's unexpected. Okay.\nSo let me repeat that again.\nIf I think that something's\ncoming that's going to be great,\nlet's say I lean into a habit,\nI manage to override my limbic friction,\nand I'm doing my 45 minutes\nof writing in the morning\nwith no phone and no internet\nand I'm getting toward the end,\nand I'm anticipating how\nI'm actually doing this,\nthis is great, I did it,\nI'm feeling really, really good.\nI finish, I definitely will\nreceive a dopamine reward,\nI'll make my own dopamine reward,\nthat's where it comes from.\nRemember, this is all internal.\nHowever, I will also\nreceive a dopamine reward\nif unexpectedly something\npositive happens.\nAnd typically if something unexpected\nbut positive happens,\nthe amount of dopamine reward\nthat we get is actually much greater\nthan in any other conditions.\nHowever, it's hard to surprise yourself\nabout a behavior that you're\ndeliberately engaging in.\nSo that becomes a bit of a tricky one.\nReward prediction error also says\nthat if we expect a reward\nand the reward doesn't come\nthat the pattern of dopamine release\nwill follow a particular contour\nand that contour is very important.\nHere's how it goes.\nLet's say that I'm writing\nand I'm about 30 or 45 minutes in,\nI'm thinking, \"Ah, this is great.\"\n\"I'm actually, I managed to do this\"\n\"I'm succeeding in\nexecuting the behaviors\"\n\"that I need to in order\nto perform this habit.\"\n\"I'm overriding limbic friction.\"\nJust that series of thoughts will start\nto generate the dopamine release\nwithin my brain and body.\nHowever, if at the 15\nminute mark the phone rings\nand I pick up the phone\nor I break my own protocol, I\nbreak my own self-discipline\nand I go on and check social media\nor I do something that\ntakes me out of that,\nwhat's going to happen is\nthat my level of dopamine\nis actually going\nto drop below the baseline,\nmeaning below the level of dopamine I had\nbefore I even started the\nhabit execution. Okay?\nSo what this is, is this\nsystem that predicts whether\nor not rewards are going to come.\nWhen we think a reward is going to come,\nit starts to actually arrive earlier\nin the form of dopamine release.\nThis is the feeling\nthat we experience as\npositive anticipation.\nYou tell a kid,\n\"Hey, we're going to go\nto the amusement park.\" Or\n\"We're going to go get ice cream.\"\nThey haven't had the ice cream yet,\nthey're not at the amusement park,\nbut they're excited, the\ndopamine release comes earlier.\nOkay? They get to the amusement park\nor they get the ice cream,\nthey will also have some dopamine release\nassociated with that.\nBut most of it, believe it or not,\ncame in the form of the anticipation.\nAnd dopamine has some qualities\nthat make the actual ice cream\nand the actual amusement park\nexperience more pleasurable\nthan it would be had that\ndopamine release not happened.\nNow of course, the other way\nto do is to surprise a kid.\nYou tell them,\n\"Listen, we're going to the\nclass that you absolutely hate.\"\nOr \"We're going to go see the person\"\n\"that you absolutely despise.\"\nAnd then you drive them\nto the amusement park\nthat's the big release of dopamine.\nBut reward prediction error also says\nthat if you tell the kid, or yourself,\n\"Okay, we're headed to\nthe amusement park.\"\n\"We're going to get some ice cream.\"\nThey're really, really excited.\nAnd then you get there and it's closed,\nor they're not letting any more people in,\nwell then the dopamine level\ndrops way below what it was\nbefore you told them that\nyou were headed there. Okay?\nI've given a number of different examples\nthat hopefully make this clear.\nReward prediction error\ngoverns virtually all aspects\nof effort and all aspects of learning.\nWhy? Because when dopamine\nis released in the brain\nand body, the neural circuits\nof our brain and body change.\nThere's a state change.\nOur over level, excuse me,\nour overall level of energy,\nbut also the sorts of sensory events\nthat we're paying attention to changes\nwhen there's a lot of\ndopamine in our system.\nNow you can leverage\nthis for habit formation.\nThink back to task bracketing.\nThink back to limbic friction.\nIf you are considering\nadopting a new habit\nor if you are trying to break a habit,\nsomething we haven't\ntalked too much about,\nbut we will in a moment, it's very useful\nto think not just about\nthe procedural aspects\nof what you're going to do,\nbut also think about\nthe events that precede\nand follow that particular habit,\nand the execution, or at least the effort\nto execute that habit.\nWhat you're doing is you're\ncasting a kind of a spotlight\naround a bin of time, or a set of events,\nfor which dopamine can be associated.\nWhat does this look like\nin the practical sense?\nWell again,\nI'll just try and use very\nsimple concrete examples,\nbut this could carry over to anything.\nLet's say I were somebody who\nhas a hard time getting in\nthat 30 to 60 minutes\nof zone II cardiovascular\nexercise mid-morning.\nThis is actually an issue for me.\nI much prefer to do resistance exercise\nthan cardiovascular exercise,\nalthough once I do it, I\nalways feel much better\nthat I've done it.\nWhat I should do is positively\nanticipate the onset\nand the offset of that session. Right?\nSo thinking about leaning into the effort,\ngoing out and doing that\nzone II cardio session,\nand I should think about\nhow I'm going to feel after.\nSo, not just thinking about\nhow great I'm going to feel after,\nbut also thinking about\nhow hard it's going to be\nat the beginning,\nand then trying to reward\nmyself subjectively\nfor the entire experience.\nIn other words, start\nrewarding task-bracketing\nin addition to rewarding the\nexecution of the habit itself.\nNow some of you might be saying,\n\"Well, wait this is all self-talk.\"\n\"This is just positive self-talk.\"\nBut it's not positive self-talk,\nit's not saying, you know,\n\"I feel so great about doing something\"\n\"that I actually hate.\"\nYou can't lie to yourself,\nor you're welcome to lie to yourself,\nbut the neuroscience literature,\nthe literature of growth mindset,\nall the literature basically of mindset\nspeaks to the fact that\nwhen you lie to yourself,\nyou know you're lying,\nand you actually set up the\nopposite of a reward system.\nSo, you have to be brutally\nhonest with yourself\nthat, for instance,\n\"I don't like initiating\nthis cardiovascular exercise\"\n\"but I do like the fact that I've done it\"\n\"after I've done it.\"\nSo what you are doing is\nyou are applying reward prediction error\nto the entire sequence of things\nthat's involved in getting\ninto the habit execution,\ngetting through the habit execution,\nand getting out of the habit of execution.\nHow do you do this?\nWell, I take us back\nto our procedural memory\nvisualization exercises\nwe talked about earlier.\nWhen I talked about it in that context,\nI talked about walking through\nmentally the series of steps\nthat's required to perform\na particular habit.\nSo in the case of the zone\nII cardio thing it would be,\n\"Okay up and put on my shoes,\"\n\"then I'm going to head out the door,\"\n\"then I'm going to drive up the road.\"\nThere is a particular\ncanyon near here that,\nif I'm going to run,\nI happen to like running, or\nI don't hate running enough\nthat I tend to do it.\nGoing through that, heading\nback, et cetera, et cetera.\nThat's great, but even better\nwould be to broaden the time bin\nand start to positively\nanticipate the period headed\ninto the habit, so even\nbefore you put on your shoes.\nThe fact that you are\nsuccessfully placing the habit in,\nin this case, phase one of the day\nand that afterwards I'm going\nto feel a particular set\nof positive benefits,\nelevated mood, et cetera.\nI like being hungry and quickly\nafter I exercise I'm hungry,\nso I like being hungry\nbecause I like eating,\nso there's a whole set of things\nthat link up with one another.\nSo I'm not just thinking\nabout habit execution\nas this isolated little set of events,\nor this little time bin,\nbut rather, I'm drawing a\nlarger envelope around it\nand starting to positively\nassociate dopamine reward\nwith that larger envelope.\nAnd for those of you that are thinking,\n\"Well, this is just a\npsychological trick.\"\nYou know, you're kind of like,\n\"This is sort of like lying to yourself.\"\nIt's not because you're not\nactually contradicting the fact\nthat some of this is unpleasant.\nWhat you're doing is\nyou're taking this\nentire series of events,\nwhat I'm calling this\nkind of time envelope,\nand you're associating it\nwith a particular reward\nthat comes later,\nwhich for me would be the\nfeeling that, you know,\nthat I've completed this.\nRight? Because for me that's\nusually a good feeling.\nSo reward prediction error is beautiful,\nnot just because it's a\nsort of math of anticipation\nand reward, or a math of anticipation\nand disappointment,\nit's beautiful because you can stretch out\nor make more narrow the time bins\nin which reward prediction error works.\nReward prediction error is the way\nin which people navigate\nfour year degrees.\nRight? I mean, you go, sure, final exam\nto final exam, et cetera.\nBut ultimately, there's\na big payoff at the end\nand it's all basically\nfor that big payoff.\nAnd of course, I understand\nthat it's the journey,\nnot the destination, but let's face it,\nfor a lot of us goals\nand habits are about achieving\nsome sort of destination.\nIn the case of zone II cardio,\nfor me it's about trying to\nstay alive for as long as I can,\nas long as I can with vitality, that is.\nAnd it's also the fact\nthat if I'm doing that,\nI get to eat the foods that I like.\nI tend to be able to eat more,\nwhich I happen to really enjoy eating,\nso much so that I'd like\nit just as an activity.\nSo basically what you're trying to do\nis not restrict your\nthinking to just the habit\nthat you're trying to form, but rather,\nto grab ahold of the timing before\nand after that particular habit\nand start to positively\nassociate reward mechanisms\nin your brain with that entire time bin.\nThis is a very useful\nand very powerful tool\nin order to form habits.\nAnd I should say that it's not something\nthat comes naturally to most people.\nIn fact, even as I describe it,\nyou might find it's still\na little bit abstract,\nbut what I encourage you to do,\nif you are finding it to\nbe a little bit vague,\nwould be to pick the habit\nthat you want to form,\nwrite down or think about very concretely\nwhat is the sequence of steps involved\nin the execution of that habit,\nand then write down or think about\nwhat is the sequence of events\nthat need to precede that habit,\nmaybe the immediate 10\nor 15 minutes before,\nas well as the immediate\nsequence of events\nand/or feelings that will\noccur after that habit,\nand then call the whole\nthing a habit execution.\nThe whole thing a effort to\nengage in that particular habit.\nAnd in doing that, and\nin positively associating\nwith the idea that you're going\nto complete that entire sequence,\nyou will engage reward prediction error\nin the proper way that the dopamine surge\ncan lend itself towards motivation.\nBecause ultimately, dopamine\nis not about feeling good,\nit's about feeling motivated.\nThis is something\nthat I've talked about\nnumerous times before,\nbut dopamine, contrary to popular belief,\nis not a reward molecule,\nso much as it is a molecule\nof motivation and drive.\nAnd the natural consequence\nof doing the exercise I just described,\nof writing things out that precede,\nare involved in the immediate\nexecution of the habit,\nand follow the habit,\nwill allow you to experience\nan increase in energy\nand thereby an increase in likelihood\nthat you're going to engage\nin that entire sequence of events.\nAnd the reason for that is\nthat dopamine gives us energy,\nand the reason for that is\nthat the molecule epinephrine,\nadrenaline, is actually\nmanufactured from dopamine.\nBiochemically, it comes from dopamine.\nSo, dopamine is powerful\nand you can access more dopamine\naround even habits that\nyou haven't yet formed\nby taking this broader time envelope\nand task-bracketing that\nspecific task execution\nor habit execution.\nWay back at the beginning of the episode,\nIn promised you that I\nwould deliver two programs\nthat are geared towards habit formation.\nAnd I promised that I would give you ways\nin which you could gauge whether\nor not certain habits had\nmoved from high effort,\nwhat I call high limbic\nfriction, to reflexive.\nAnd we talked about a\nnumber of way to gauge that.\nIn researching this episode,\nI found a tremendous\nnumber of different systems\nfor habit formation.\nIt's really amazing how much is out there.\nThere, one says 60 days to this,\nor 21 days to that, or 18 days to this.\nI mean,\nit's just rampant in the\npopular psychology literature\nand in the self-help literature.\nI want to spell out a particular system\nthat I think could be very useful\nto most if not all people\nthat's rooted in the\nbiology of habit formation,\nrooted in the psychology\nof habit formation,\nand that is entirely\ncompatible with that phase one,\nphase two, phase three type program\nthat I talked about earlier,\nbut encompasses a bit\nof a longer time scale\nand really arrives at a kind\nof a system, if you will,\nfor how to build in habits\nand then to test whether\nor not those habits\nhave really stuck\nand whether or not they're\nlikely to stick going forward.\nAnd so this, at least for\nthe sake of this example,\na 21 day system.\nI picked 21 days because\nthat seems to be the average\nor most typical system for\nengaging neuroplasticity\nas it relates to the\nformation of new habits.\nThis 21 day system, actually,\nis one that someone I know very well uses\nand has used for a very long time.\nThey actually, their kids use it as well.\nAnd it has a certain elegance to it\nand I think as I describe it that elegance\nwill begin to reveal itself.\nSo basically what this\ninvolves is you set out\nto perform 6 new habits per day\nacross the course of 21 days.\nWhy 6 and why 21?\nWell, we'll talk about that in a moment.\nBut the idea is, you write down 6 things\nthat you would like to\ndo every day for 21 days.\nWhat phase of the day\nthose things fall into?\nWell, that will depend on what they are\nand how they relate to\nthose earlier phase one,\nphase two, phase three, but for now,\n21 days, 6 things per day. However,\nthe expectation is that\nyou'll only complete 4\nto 5 of those each day. Okay?\nSo built into this is a\nkind of permission to fail,\nbut it's not failure,\nbecause it turns out that this approach\nto forming habits is based\nnot so much on the specific habits\nthat you're trying to form,\nbut the habit of performing habits. Right?\nIt's the habit of doing a\ncertain number of things per day.\nSo, you set out to perform 6.\nNow, another reason for not\nnecessarily performing all 6 is\nthat some activities probably\nshouldn't be performed each day.\nFor instance, in my case,\nif I were to weight train\nor even run every day, I'm of the sort,\nor my biology is of the sort\nthat I don't recover so well.\nSo I wouldn't want to do\nresistance training every day,\nbut I might want to do it 4\ndays a week, for instance.\nSo by having 6 things in that list,\nyou could shuffle out\nthat particular activity\non particular days of the week,\nand simply do 4 or 5 other activities.\nSo 21 days, you list out 4 to 5 things.\nSo it might be zone II\ncardio, resistance training,\nsunlight viewing, writing\ncould be journaling,\nit could be learning a\nlanguage, mathematics.\nAgain this is going to vary\ndepending on your particular goal\nand the habits that\nyou're trying to create.\nBut no more than six\nand the expectation is\nthat you're not going to\nperform more than 4 to 5.\nIf you miss a day, meaning you\ndon't perform 4 to 5 things,\nthere is no punishment.\nAnd in fact it's important\nthat you don't actually try\nand do what, in the literature,\nis called a habit slip compensation,\nwhich is just fancy psychological language\nfor if you screw up and you\ndon't get all 4 or 5 in one day,\nyou don't do 8 the next\nday in order to compensate.\nThis actually brings me\nback to an example I had\nfrom graduate school.\nI remember when I started graduate school\nfeeling very excited, but\na little bit overwhelmed\nby the amount of things that I had to do\nbecause I had to both do\nresearch, I was doing coursework,\nat the time graduate students stipends,\nand still now unfortunately,\nwere depressingly low\nso it was financially stressful.\nThere were a number of things happening\nand I remember a neurologist,\nthis was at UC Berkeley,\nhe was a really fantastic\nscientist and person,\nhis name was Bob Knight,\nsome of you may know him.\nI remember he, I went to\nhim and I asked, you know,\n\"What is the process by which someone\"\n\"actually navigates graduate\nschool successfully?\"\nAnd he said, \"Listen, you\ndon't want to do anything\"\n\"or engage in a routine in any way\"\n\"that you can't keep up consistently\"\n\"for at least five and\nideally 6 days per week.\"\nI thought, \"Oh, that's pretty good.\"\nAnd he said, \"Every 4 or 5 years\"\n\"you might have to update that,\"\n\"but you need to decide what\nyou can do consistently,\"\n\"what you can do every day\nor at least six days a week,\"\n\"or 5 days a week.\"\nAnd that was very very useful to me\nand it fits well with this\nnotion of habit slips,\nthat if you happen to screw\nup and not be able to engage\nin whatever habits you're trying to learn\nfor whatever reason, that the next day,\nyou just get right back on on\nthe on the horse, so to speak.\nHowever, there's a really\ninteresting feature\nfrom the neuroscience literature\nand from the psychology that says\nthat chunking this 21 days into 2 day bins\ncan be very, very useful.\nWhile it is true that the unit of the day\nthat our cells use is a\ncircadian one, a 24-hour clock,\nthere does seem to be something powerful\nabout engaging in particular habits,\nin a particular sequence,\nfor two days in a row,\nand then resetting, so thinking,\n\"Okay I can do this for a day\"\n\"and if I can do it for a day,\"\n\"I can probably do it for 2 days.\"\nAnd then resetting. So every\n2 days you're resetting.\nSo you're kind of chunking 21 days\ninto a series of 2 day bins,\nin which you are trying\nto perform 4 to 5 new habits\nand then completing that 21 days.\nNow, everything I've described\nabout this 21-day program\nwith 6 things that you're\ntrying to do with new habits\nand only performing 4 to 5 and\nnot compensating, et cetera.\nThere's nothing neuroscientifically\nunique about it,\nexcept for the fact that\nit's not just 21 days,\nbroken up into two day chunks.\nAfter 21 days, you stop engaging\nin this 21-day deliberate\n4 to 5 things per day,\ntight schedule, and you\nsimply go into autopilot.\nYou ask yourself how many\nof those particular habits\nthat I was deliberately trying to learn\nin the previous 21 days are\nautomatically incorporated\ninto my schedule?\nHow many of them am I naturally doing?\nIn other words, every\n21 days you don't update\nand start adding new habits.\nYou simply try and maintain the ones\nthat you built in that first 21 days.\nAnd this I think is extremely important\nbecause in all the habit\nliterature that I could find,\nsure, there was a lot\nof psychological data\nand neuroscience data,\nbehavioral science data\naround here's how you form a habit,\nhere's how you break a habit.\nThere was even some\nkind of test for whether\nor not a habit had really\nachieved context independence,\nwhether or not it was a\nstrongly formed habit.\nBut there wasn't a lot of information,\nat least by my search,\nof what to do once you've formed a habit,\nand how to evaluate whether\nor not that habit is likely to\npersist long into the future.\nSo here's the idea, you\nset out these 6 things\nthat you would like to learn,\nor that you would like\nto acquire in your life,\nthese habits, you only expect\nthat you're going to\nperform 4 or 5 each day,\nyou do that for 21 days.\nAgain, if you miss a day,\nyou just hop right back on the next day.\nHowever, you should think\nabout the functional units\nwithin this 21 day period as 2 days.\nYou can try and nail 4 to 5\nof these things for 2 days.\nIf you happen to get all 6, great,\nbut that's not necessarily required.\nSo you can do it for 2\ndays then reset 2 days,\nthen reset 2 days, and\nthen in the next 21 days,\nyou're not trying to\nacquire any new habits,\nyou're not going to throw in 6 more habits\nthat you want to learn,\nyou're simply going to assess\nhow well, how deeply, you\nrewired your nervous system\nto be able to perform those 6 habits\nof the previous 21 days.\nAnd this is extremely useful, I believe,\nbecause it will allow you to asses whether\nor not you can indeed make room,\nif you even have room, I\nshould say, for more habits.\nMany people are trying to\ncram so many new behaviors\ninto their nervous system,\nthat they don't stand a chance\nof learning all those behaviors.\nWhat you may find,\nis that you kept up 2 of\nthose things very consistently\nthroughout the 21 days.\nAnd perhaps there was one of\nthem that you did sporadically,\nand that there were 3\nothers that, frankly,\nyou didn't manage to execute.\nYou may also be one of these\npeople, one of these mutants,\nthat sets out to do 6 new\nthings per day for 21 days\nand performs every single one of them.\nTerrific. More power to you. In that case,\nfor the following 21\ndays, let's see whether\nor not you can continue to\nperform those very same 6 things\nevery day for 21 days,\nand then, and only then,\nwould you want to add more habits in.\nSo you could repeat this\n21 day process, you know,\n21 days of new habit, 21 days\nof testing those new habits\nas to whether or not\nthey're reflexive or not.\nYou could do that forever, if you wanted.\nBut the idea is that this isn't something\nthat you're doing all year long.\nIt's that you're perhaps\nstarting the new year\nor regardless of when\nyou're listening to this,\nyou set out to make that 21\nday really the stimulus period\nin which the habits get wired in\nand then the following month,\nand maybe even the following\nmonths, or periods of 21 days,\nare really the kind of\nthermometer or the test bed\nof how well you've embedded\nthose particular habits.\nAnd if indeed you want to\ncontinue to add new habits\nor you find that certain\nhabits that you weren't able\nto embed in your nervous\nsystem and make reflexive,\nyou want to then bring\nthose in, fantastic.\nBut it's only once you've\nachieved all those 6 habits\nas reflexive, that you would move forward.\nAnd I think this sort of system,\nwhile it could have been replaced\nwith many other different systems.\nAgain, there's nothing\nholy about this system.\nBut this particular system\nhas a number of features,\nthe lack of compensation for missed days,\nthe fact that it's a fairly\nhigh intensity program\nfor 21 days, but then you test yourself,\na kind of competition test\nwith yourself, if you will.\nThose features and the\nfact that habit slips,\nmissing of particular habits\nand not doing all 6 is kind\nof built into the system,\nI think makes it a very reasonable one.\nIt's very adaptable to the real world.\nAnd I think it's one that,\nprovided you obey the phase one,\nphase two, phase three type system\nthat we talked about earlier,\nyou collapse these two\nprograms with one another,\nwhich hopefully will be easy,\nbased on the descriptions I've\ngiven. Well, if you do that,\nand I think there's a\nvery high probability\nthat the habits that you try and form\nwill achieve this context dependence\nand that it will take\nprogressively less limbic friction\nto try and perform them.\nThus far, we've almost\nexclusively been discussing\nhow to form habits.\nBut what about breaking habits?\nCertainly many people out there\nwould like to break habits\nthat they feel don't serve them well.\nOne of the challenges\nin breaking habits is\nthat many habits occur very, very quickly\nand so there isn't an\nopportunity to intervene\nuntil the habit has already been initiated\nand in some cases completed.\nWell, there are a couple of tools\nthat neuroscience and psychology tell us\ncan be very beneficial.\nSome of those things\nare somewhat intuitive\nand relate to what I call\nfoundation practices.\nMeaning things that set the overall tone\nin your body and brain, such\nthat you would be less likely\nto engage in a particular habit\nor that would raise\nyour level of awareness,\nboth of your situation and\nto how you feel inside.\nSo things like stress reduction.\nThings like getting good sleep.\nThings like quality nutrition.\nThings like having positive routines\narranged throughout your day.\nAll of those, of course, will support you\nin trying to break particular habits.\nAnd while that can be very useful,\nit's admittedly very generic advice.\nIt doesn't point to any\none specific protocol.\nIn order to identify a specific protocol\nthat one could apply in\norder to break habits,\nwe have to look at the mirror image\nof the sort of neuroplasticity\nthat we talked about at the\nbeginning of the episode.\nAt the beginning of the episode,\nwe talked about a form of neuroplasticity\ncalled long term potentiation,\ninvolving the NMDA receptor.\nJust to refresh your memory a little bit,\nit says that if a set of neurons\nis very electrically active\nit's likely that those\nneurons will communicate\nwith themselves more easily\nbecause of changes in things\nlike NMDA receptor activity,\nthe recruitment of additional\nreceptors, et cetera.\nIt's essentially a cellular\nand molecular explanation\nfor how something goes from unlearned,\nto learned, to reflexive.\nNow, in order to break synapses,\nor to break apart neural connections\nthat are serving a habit that\nyou don't want to engage in,\nwe need to engage the process\ncalled long term depression.\nAnd long term depression has nothing to do\nwith a state of mental depression\nor a reduction in mood.\nSo I really want to be clear that\nwhen I say depression in this context\nit has nothing to do with\npsychological depression,\nit has nothing to do with mood.\nIt's simply called long term depression\nbecause just as long\nterm potentiation says\nif neuron A triggers\nthe firing of neuron B,\nand it does so very robustly\nover and over and over again,\nthen neuron A will not\nhave to fire as intensely,\nor as frequently, in\norder to activate neuron B\nin the future because\nthey become potentiated.\nRight? The threshold for\nco-activation has been reduced.\nThere's a much higher probability\nthat they will be activated together\nat low levels of intensity.\nThat's essentially what\nlong term potentiation is.\nLong term depression says\nthat if neuron A is active\nand neuron B is not active\nwithin a particular time window,\nthen the connection between\nneuron A and B will weaken\nover time, even if they started\noff very strongly connected.\nOkay? So, I'm going to repeat that\nbecause this is a pretty detailed\nneurobiological mechanism\nwhereby if neuron A,\nand neuron B is active,\nbut at a different time\nor outside a particular,\nwhat we call, temporal window,\nmeaning outside a particular time window,\nthen through long term depression,\nthe connection between neuron\nA and neuron B will weaken.\nAnd just as a point of interest,\nthe NMDA receptor is also\ninvolved in long term depression,\nalthough there are other\nmolecular components involved\nas well.\nSo how do you take two neurons\nthat underlie a habit out of synchrony?\nHow do you get them to\nfire asynchronously?\nThis is pretty interesting\nwith respect to the cellular\nand molecular biology, but\nat the behavioral level,\nit's especially interesting.\nThey way that one would do this\nis, let's say for instance,\nyou have a habit of picking up\nyour phone mid work session.\nOkay? That's a reflexive habit I think\nthat most people have experienced.\nAnd we often hear the idea that, oh,\nthe phone is so filled\nwith access to dopamine\nand incredible things that\nwe're just drawn to it.\nBut if you noticed what's\nhappened with phone use over time,\nmost people, including\nmyself sometimes I admit,\nfind ourselves just looking at our phone,\nor find ourselves in a particular app\nwithout actually having engaged\nin the conscious set of steps of,\n\"Oh I'm really curious\"\n\"what's going on in this particular app.\"\n\"I'm really curious\"\n\"what's going on in this\nparticular website.\"\nAnd you just kind of \"find\nyourself\", in air quotes,\nfor those of you listening,\nI'm making air quotes.\nYou just sort of find yourself\ndoing it because the behavior\nof picking up your phone\nis sort of reflexive,\nor has become fully reflexive.\nYou see this a lot at meals\nwhere multiple people are there\nand no one's looking at their phone\nand then all of a sudden\nsomeone takes out their phone\nand you'll notice\nthat other people just\nnaturally take out their phone.\nIt's this kind observation induced reflex.\nAnd I would wager that most\npeople aren't consciously aware\nof the immediate steps involved.\nSo the literature says\nthere are a number of ways\nto break these sorts\nof habitual behaviors,\nor reflexive behaviors.\nMost of those approaches\ninvolve establishing some sort\nof reward for not performing the activity\nor some sort of punishment\nfor forming the activity.\nI've heard of some basic things\nthat some people will do,\nlike they'll even put like a\nrubber band on their wrist,\nand every time they complain,\nor every time they do some behavior,\nlike pick up their phone,\nthey'll give themselves\na snap on the wrist.\nAnd yeah, the rationale\nthere is that you're trying\nto create a somatic, a very\nphysical representation\nof something that makes it very real\nand harder to overlook.\nOther people will just do a\ntick mark on a piece of paper.\nThis sort of, \"What gets\nmeasured is what gets managed\"\nkind of mindset, where if\nevery time you do something,\nyou take away the judgment,\nthis is very new age-y,\nI realize, but this is\nwhat you find out there,\nif you search the literature.\nEven on PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,\nthat every time you engage in a behavior,\nyou just measure the fact\nthat you did that behavior,\nyou just mark it down.\nAt the end of the day, people\nare supposed to look at that\nand say, \"Oh my goodness!\"\n\"I can't believe that I\nspent, you know, 3 hours.\"\nOr, \"I did it 46 times.\"\nAnd in fact, a lot of\napps, social media apps,\nwill start to give you\nwarnings now, if you opt in,\nthat you've been on the app for an hour,\nwould you like to leave?\nMost people just click right\npast it and go back in.\nI think very few people\nsay, \"Oh my goodness!\"\n\"It's been an hour and\ntherefor you're right,\"\n\"I absolutely shouldn't\nengage in this any more.\"\nIt's just far to easy to just\nblow past those reminders.\nWell, the literature on habit formation\nand habit reduction, breaking\nhabits, has been analyzed.\nThere's a beautiful meta-analysis,\nwhich involves looking at a number\nof different studies all together,\ncomparing the statistical\nstrength of each of those studies,\nlooking in different conditions\nwhat sorts of habits were\ntrying to be made or broken.\nThe first author on this\nreview is Fritz, F R I T Z.\nI'll certainly put a link to this.\nIt's Heather Fritz and it's\n\"Intervention to modify\nhabits: a scoping review.\"\nAnd it is indeed a very\nbroad scale review. It's from\nthe Journal of Occupation\nParticipation and Health.\nIt's published in 2020.\nIt's a really nice article.\nA couple of things I\nlearned from this article\nand then I'll get into the specific tool\nfor breaking habits.\nPerhaps the most interesting\nthing that I took\nfrom this review was the finding\nthat notifications to\neither engage in habits\nor to not engage in habits\nactually were not very\neffective over time.\nThey were effective in\nthe immediate period\nwhen people started using\nthese notifications,\nas were little sticky notes, like,\n\"Don't go into the refrigerator\"\n\"between the hours of\nwhatever and whatever.\"\nOr just visual reminders,\nphysical reminders or electronic reminders\nwere effective in the immediate term,\nbut in the long term,\ndid not predict whether\nor not people would effectively stick\nto habits they were trying to stick to,\nor break habits that they\nwere trying to break.\nSo sadly, that doesn't\nseem to work very well.\nAnd perhaps they just need to come up\nwith more robust reminders.\nI don't know, mild electric shock\nor something like that\nbecause what we do know,\nonly sort of kidding\nabout mild electric shock,\nbut what we do know from both human\nand animal studies is that\nthings like electric shock,\nthings like monetary penalties, right?\nHaving to pay out every time you engage\nin a particular behavior.\nThose are pretty effective\nways to break habits.\nThe problems is when people\nare not being monitored\nfor habit use, for instance,\nyou can imagine a situation where you say,\n\"I'm not going to pick up my phone\"\n\"for the 4 hours in the\nearly part of the day\"\n\"so I can get, you know, real\ndedicated focused work done.\"\nUnless someone's monitoring\nthem, then people don't tend\nto monitor themselves completely enough\nthat they punish themselves\ncompletely enough,\nthat they break the behavior.\nIn other words, the\npunishment isn't bad enough,\nin order to break the habit,\nwhich just speaks to how\npowerful these habits are\nonce they become reflexive.\nThey're just very, very hard to override.\nSo it turns out that the key\nto generating long term\ndepression in these pathways\nis actually to take the period\nimmediately following\nthe bad habit execution,\nmeaning, let's say you tell yourself\nyou're not going to pick up your phone,\nyou're not going to bite your nails,\nyou're not going to reflexively walk\nto the refrigerator at a\nparticular time or day,\nbut you find yourself doing it anyway,\nand what actually has to happen\nis bringing conscious awareness\nto the period immediately afterwards,\nwhich I think most people recognize,\nthey realize \"Ugh I just did\nit again. I just did it again.\"\nAnd in that moment, capture\nthe sequence of events,\nnot that led to the bad habit execution,\nbut actually to take advantage of the fact\nthat the neurons that were responsible\nfor generating that bad habit\nwere active a moment ago,\nand to actually engage\nin a replacement behavior\nimmediately afterward.\nNow, this is really interesting\nand I think powerful\nbecause I would have thought\nthat you have to engage\nin a replacement behavior\nthat truly replaces the\nbad habit behavior, right?\nThat you would have to be able\nto identify your state of mind\nor the sequence of events\nleading into the bad habit,\nbut rather, the stage\nor the period immediately\nafter the bad habit execution,\nis a unique opportunity to\ninsert a different type of,\nwhat we would call adaptive behavior,\nbut that could be any\nbehavior that's not in line\nwith the bad behavior, so\nlet's give it an example.\nLet's say you find yourself,\nyou're trying to do focused\nwork, you pick up your phone,\nyou're disappointed in yourself\nfor picking up your phone,\nyou could of course just put it down,\nand re-engage in the work behavior,\nbut if you were good at that,\nthen you probably wouldn't have\ndone it in the first place.\nAnd so, what turns out\nto be very effective,\nis to go engage in some\nother positive habit.\nNow, this has two major effects.\nThe first one is you start\nto link in time the\nexecution of a bad behavior\nto this other good behavior.\nAnd in doing so, you start to\nrecruit other neural circuits,\nother neurons, that can start\nto somewhat dismantle sequence of firing\nassociated with the bad behavior.\nIn other words, you start to\ncreate a kind of a double habit\nthat starts with a bad habit,\nand then ends with a good habit.\nAnd that seems to create\nenough of a temporal mismatch\nso that then recognizing\nwhen you're heading toward to bad habit\nbecomes more apparent to you.\nSo again, I want to make\nthis very, very concrete.\nLet's say\nthat the behavior is reflexively\npicking up one's phone.\nYou do that, you think, \"Ugh,\ngoodness, I did it again.\"\nHere's what I'm going to do,\nyou would set that down\nand then you would engage in\nsome other positive behavior,\nthat you've deemed positive.\nAnd here, it's very\nsubjective, so it's hard\nfor me to give an example\nthat will necessarily\nmake sense to everybody,\nbut perhaps you're working on hydration,\nso maybe you go have a glass of water.\nMaybe you're trying to do\nbreath work or something.\nMaybe you're trying to enhance\nyour language speaking skills\nso you go and you spend 5 minutes\ndoing a particular type\nof language learning.\nYou literally exit whatever you were doing\nand perform that other new positive habit\nin the immediate period right after that,\neven for a short period of time.\nIt's a little bit counterintuitive,\nbut what this does it\ncreates kind of a cognitive\nand a temporal mismatch between\nthe initial bad behavior,\nwhich before is what we would\ncall sort of a closed loop,\nand the engineers out there will know\nwhat I'm talking about.\nBut in a closed loop, so one behavior,\none set of neural\nfirings, leads to another,\nleads to another,\nand then just kind of sets\nthe same thing in motion.\nIt can be kind of a self\nperpetuating system.\nBy changing the number of\nfeatures that are in that loop,\nit disrupts the closed\nnature of that loop,\nit creates what we call an open loop,\nand in an open loop, you are\nbetter able to intervene.\nSo, as I mentioned before, this\nmight seem counterintuitive,\nyou might think,\n\"Why would I want to reward\nthe execution of a bad habit\"\n\"with a good habit.\"\n\"I don't want to reward\nmyself for the bad habit.\"\nBut really what you're\ntrying to do is you're trying\nto change the nature\nof the neural circuits\nthat are firing so that\nyou can rewrite the script\nfor that bad habit.\nA different way to put it would be,\nimagine that the bad habit\nis like a chord on the piano\nthat you play, or a chord notes,\nor a sequence of notes\nthat you would play,\nand it comes very easily.\nYou can play it every single time.\nBut, let's say,\nas you're trying to learn\na new piece of music,\nyou're just constantly inserting that\nat the inappropriate time.\nThat was, you know, I think\nit was a decent enough analogy\nfor a bad habit because it\ninvolves some motor execution.\nYou just find yourself doing it.\nRather than trying to prevent\nyourself from doing it,\nthe next time you do\nit, add in a new chord\nor sequence that you're trying to learn.\nWhat this does then is it\nchanges the whole nature\nof the sequence of neurons\nthat are firing from bad habit\nthrough to the end of this\nnewly applied good habit.\nSo, this is the way in which\nyou start to dismantle or,\nwhen I say dismantle,\nreally weaken the likelihood\nthat if neuron A fires,\nneuron B will fire.\nBecause, as you're\nstarting off in the mode\nof very reflexively\nperforming a bad habit,\nthose neurons are firing together\nwithout you consciously being aware of it.\nIt's almost impossible for\nyou to intervene in yourself\nwithout a number of other features,\nlike severe punishment, severe\nconsequence type outcomes.\nRather, tacking on some\nadditional sequences,\nlike if neuron A, neuron B\nfires, and then you're saying,\n\"Okay well, if neuron B fires,\"\n\"I'm going to start inserting\nneuron C, D, E, F to fire.\"\nRight? That's the, C, D, E,\nF being the positive behavior\nthat you're going to insert.\nAnd in doing so, you create a\nchain of neuronal activation\nthat then is very easy to dismantle.\nAnd so, when people have\napplied this kind of approach,\nit removes the need to have\nconstant conscious awareness\nof one's own behavior\nprior to that behavior,\nwhich is very, very difficult to achieve.\nRather, what they find is\nthat they are able to engage\nin re-mapping of neural circuits\nassociated with bad habits\nin ways that are very,\nvery straightforward.\nRight? Because you can always identify\nwhen you've done the\nthing you don't want to do\nand then tack on to that\nsomething additional\nthat's positive.\nNow, the nature of that\npositive thing is important.\nYou don't want it to be something\nthat's very hard to execute.\nYou want it to be\nsomething that's positive\nand fairly easy to execute,\nso that you're not struggling all the time\nto insert this on top\nof this bad behavior,\nwhatever that bad behavior\nmight happen to be.\nBut again,\nthis is rooted in the biology\nof long term depression,\nit maps very well to the\nbehavioral change literature\nthat I was able to glean that really shows\nthat rather than just get reminders,\nrather than try and instill punishment,\nrather than setting up reward\nfor breaking bad habits,\nthat perhaps the simplest\nway to approach this is\nto tack on additional\nbehaviors to the bad habits,\nmake sure those behaviors\nare good behaviors,\nor behaviors that are adaptive for you,\nand in doing so, you will soon find\nthat the initiation of the bad habit\ntakes on a whole new form\nor that you're not even\ninspired to do it at all.\nAnd of course, I want to acknowledge\nthat breaking bad habits is really hard.\nWe had an episode all about addiction\nwith Dr. Anna Lembke from\nStanford Medical School.\nShe's a colleague of mine\nwho runs the Dual-Diagnosis\nAddiction Clinic at Stanford.\nAnd in that episode, we\ntalked a lot about how addicts\nfor drugs, alcohol, people have addictions\nto certain types of behaviors,\nor avoidance behaviors even,\nthat in the case of addiction,\nthere has to be a tremendous\nkind of full-scale campaign\nfor them to be able to\nintervene in their behavior.\nSo, for those of you\nthat are thinking about bad habit breaking\nin the context of\naddictive type behaviors,\ndefinitely check out that episode.\nAddiction does employ\nsome of these principles\naround habit making and\nhabit breaking, as it were,\nbut of course, because the consequences\nof certain habits in\naddiction can be so severe,\nthere's other sets of protocols\nand there's a kind of a\npsychological backdrop to it\nthat's very important.\nIt also relates to the\nbiology of dopamine,\nand you can find all\nof that in the episode\nwith Dr. Anna Lembke.\nSo today we've covered\na lot about the biology\nand the psychology of habit formation\nand habit breaking.\nWe talked about why certain\nhabits are so hard to wire in,\nwhy certain habits are\nso hard to break down\nand eliminate, and how we can determine\nwhich habits are going to\nbe easier for us to access\nand which habits are going to be harder\nfor us to access and break.\nWe talked a lot about this\nnotion of limbic friction\nand we talked about context dependence.\nAnd we talked about a\nnumber of different things\nas it relates to neural circuits\nand the formation of new\nconnections in the brain,\nand strengthening and weakening\nof connections in the brain.\nWe also discussed two programs.\nPrograms designed specifically for you\non the basis of the\nneurobiology literature\nand the literature on the\npsychology of habit formation\nand habit breaking.\nJust to briefly recap,\none program involves\ndividing the 24 hour day\ninto three phases, phase\none, phase two, phase three,\nand to try and tackle specific habits\nat particular phases of the 24 hour cycle.\nThe second program\ninvolved a 21 day process\nof engaging approximately\n6 new habits per day,\nalthough the expectation,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nis that you're not going\nto perform all 6 of those.\nAnd an assessment in the following 21 days\nas to whether or not you have\nindeed formed those new habits\nor not.\nAnd there were a number of other features\nthat I mentioned that were related\nto those two general programs.\nPhase one, phase two, phase\nthree, and the 21 day program,\nand how those could be meshed together.\nSo, I'm guessing some of you\nwill probably have questions\nabout those programs\nand how to apply them,\nbut hopefully they were clear\nenough for you to get started.\nThis is a good opportunity\nfor me to mention\nthat the Huberman Lab Podcast\nhas something called the\nNeural Network Newsletter\nthat is sent out\napproximately once a month.\nFor the next newsletter,\nI will release a on-paper\nversion of these two systems\nand how they mesh together\nfor habit formation\nand habit breaking, and if\nyou'd like to access that,\nyou can go to hubermanlab.com,\nyou go to the menu,\nyou can sign up for the newsletter.\nFirst of all, it's zero cost.\nSecond of all, we have\nour privacy policy there,\nbut I can tell you right now,\nwe don't share your email with any vendors\nor with any other sources.\nThose emails stay internal to us.\nAnd if you'd like to see\nwhat the sort of flavor\nof those newsletters is,\nthe previous newsletters, for instance,\none on tools for sleep,\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nor tools for neuroplasticity,\nin the classroom\nand outside the classroom as well,\nfor teachers and for\nstudents of various kinds,\nthose are also posted there\nso you can access any of\nthe previous newsletters.\nMy hope is that today you've learned\nboth the biological mechanisms\nand the practical tools\nby which you can start\nto establish habits that, for you,\nyou deem adaptive, healthy,\nand that are going to\nsupport you in your goals.\nAnd that you can start to\ndismantle some of the habits\nthat you find to be\nunhealthy or maladaptive\nfor you and for your goals.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific way to support us.\nIn addition,\non

supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive tremendous\nbenefit from supplements.\nSupplements for sleep,\nsupplements for focus,\nsupplements for various other things\nrelated to mental and physical\nhealth and performance.\nOne key issue any time\nthere's a discussion\nabout supplements, you have to be sure\nthat the supplements you are taking\nare of the very highest quality.\nAnd for that reason, we've\npartnered with Thorne,\nbecause Thorne has the\nvery highest stringency,\nwith respect to the quality of\nthe ingredients they include,\nand the precision of the\namounts of the ingredients\nthat they include in their supplements.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nand get 20% off any of those supplements,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman and,\nin addition to being able 20%\noff any of those supplements,\nif you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site\nthrough that web portal,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing us on Instagram\nand Twitter, please feel free to do so.\nThere, I teach neuroscience\nand neuroscience related tools\nin short format.\nSome of that material overlaps\nwith what you hear on the podcast,\nsome of it is unique and different\nfrom what's on the podcast.\nAnd once again,\nI want to thank you for\ngoing on this journey\nof exploring the neuroscience\nand the psychology of habit\nformation and habit breaking.\nI hope it supports you in your goals.\nAnd last but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[mellow music]"
