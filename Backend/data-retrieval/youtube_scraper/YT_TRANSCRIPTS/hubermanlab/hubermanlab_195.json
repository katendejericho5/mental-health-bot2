    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman and I'm\na Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. David Berson,\nProfessor of Medical Science,\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Brown University.\nDr. Berson's laboratory is credited\nwith discovering the cells in the eye\nthat set your circadian rhythms.\nThese are the so-called intrinsically\nphotosensitive melanopsin cells.\nAnd while that's a mouthful,\nall you need to know for sake\nof this introduction is that,\nthose are the cells that\ninform your brain and body\nabout the time of day.\nDr. Berson's laboratory has also made\na number of other important discoveries\nabout how we convert our\nperceptions of the outside world\ninto motor action.\nMore personally, Dr. Berson\nhas been my go-to resource\nfor all things neuroscience\nfor nearly two decades.\nI knew of his reputation\nas a spectacular researcher\nfor a long period of time.\nAnd then many years ago, I cold\ncalled him out of the blue,\nI basically corralled him\ninto a long conversation\nover the phone after which\nhe invited me out to Brown\nand we've been discussing neuroscience\nand how the brain works and\nthe emerging new technologies\nand the emerging new\nconcepts in neuroscience\nfor a very long time now.\nYou're going to realize today\nwhy Dr. Berson is my go-to source.\nHe has an exceptionally\nclear and organized view\nof how the nervous system works.\nThere are many many parts\nof the nervous system,\ndifferent nuclei and connections\nand circuits and chemicals\nand so forth, but it takes\na special kind of person\nto be able to organize that\ninformation into a structured\nand logical framework that\ncan allow us to make sense\nof how we function in\nterms of what we feel,\nwhat we experience, how\nwe move through the world.\nDr. Berson is truly one\nof a kind in his ability\nto synthesize and organize and\ncommunicate that information.\nAnd I give him credit\nas one of my mentors,\nand one of the people that I respect most\nin the field of science and\nmedical science generally.\nToday Dr. Berson takes us on a journey\nfrom the periphery of the nervous system,\nmeaning from the outside,\ndeep into the nervous\nsystem layer by layer,\nstructure by structure, circuit by circuit\nmaking clear to us\nhow each of these individual circuits work\nand how they work together as a whole.\nIt's a really magnificent description\nthat you simply cannot\nget from any textbook,\nfrom any popular book and\nfrankly, as far as I know,\nfrom any podcast that\ncurrently exists out there.\nSo it's a real gift to\nhave this opportunity\nto learn from Dr. Berson.\nAgain, I consider him my\nmentor in the field of learning\nand teaching neuroscience,\nand I'm excited for you to learn from him.\nOne thing is for certain,\nby the end of this podcast,\nyou will know far more about\nhow your nervous system works\nthan the vast majority of people out there\nincluding many expert\nbiologists and neuroscientists.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost to consumer\ninformation about science,\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens every day since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still take\nAthletic Greens is that,\nit covers all of my vitamin\nmineral and probiotic needs.\nNowadays there's a lot of data out there\npointing to the fact that\na healthy gut microbiome\nliterally, little microbes\nthat live in our gut,\nthat are good for us\nis important to support\nour immune system, our nervous\nsystem, our endocrine system,\nand various aspects of our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nWith Athletic Greens I get\nall the vitamins and minerals\nthat I need plus the probiotics\nensure a healthy gut microbiome.\nIt also tastes really good, I\nmix mine up with some water,\na little bit of lemon juice,\nI'll have that early in the day\nand sometimes a second time\nlater in the day as well.\nIt's compatible with intermittent fasting,\nit's compatible with vegan\ndiets, with keto diets,\nand essentially every diet\nthat you could possibly imagine out there.\nIt's also filled with\nadaptogens for recovery,\nit has digestive enzymes for gut health,\nand has a number of other things\nthat support the immune system.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim their special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nand they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3K2.\nThere's now a lot of\nevidence that vitamin D3\nsupports a huge number\nof metabolic factors,\nimmune system factors, endocrine factors,\nbasically, we need vitamin D3,\nwe can get it from the sun,\nbut many people are\ndeficient in vitamin D3\neven if they are getting\nwhat they think is sufficient sunlight.\nAnd K2 is important for\ncardiovascular health.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can claim their special offer,\nthe five free travel packs,\nplus the year supply of vitamin D3K2.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get information\nabout how your specific genes\nare impacting your immediate\nand long-term health.\nNow a problem with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there,\nis you get the numbers back\nbut you don't know what\nto do with those numbers,\nwith InsideTracker they make\nit very simple to figure out\nwhat to do to bring those\nnumbers into the ranges\nthat are right for you.\nThey have a dashboard\nthat's very easy to use,\nyou can see the numbers from\nyour blood and/or DNA tests,\nand it will point to\nspecific lifestyle factors,\nnutritional factors as\nwell as supplementation\nmaybe even prescription factors\nthat would be right for you\nto bring the numbers\ninto range that are ideal\nfor your immediate and\nlong-term health goals.\nAnother feature the InsideTracker has\nis their inner age test.\nThis test shows you what\nyour biological age is\nand compares that to\nyour chronological age\nand what you can do to\nimprove your biological age,\nwhich of course is the important number.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAlso an interview I did with\nLongevity Research Doctor\nand InsideTracker's\nFounder Dr. Gil Blander,\nis out now on their podcast,\nthe longevity by design podcast\nand a link to that interview\ncan be found in today's show notes.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Magic Spoon.\nMagic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,\nketo-friendly cereal.\nI don't follow a ketogenic diet.\nThe way that I eat is basically geared\ntoward feeling alert\nwhen I want to be alert\nand feeling sleepy when\nI want to go to sleep.\nWhich for me means fasting\nuntil about 11:00 am or noon\nmost days, then I eat\nlow carb during the day.\nSo I'll have some meat or\nfish or chicken and some salad\nthat's what works for\nme, and in the afternoon,\nI remain on a more or\nless low carb-ish diet,\nand then in the evening, I eat\npastas and things primarily\nand I throttle back on the protein\nand that's what allows me\nto fall asleep at night.\nThat's just what works for me.\nSo if I want a snack in the afternoon,\nI want that to be a\nketogenic or low carb snack\nand that snack these days is Magic Spoon.\nMagic Spoon is really terrific,\nit has zero grams of sugar,\n13 to 14 grams of protein,\nand only four net grams of\ncarbohydrates in each serving.\nIt's really delicious,\nthey have a number of\ndifferent flavors like cocoa,\nfruity, peanut butter and frosted,\nI particularly like frosted.\nIt tastes like donuts\nand I really like donuts\nalthough I try not to eat\ndonuts too often if ever.\nWhat I do lately, is I take Magic Spoon,\nI put it in some Bulgarian\nyogurt which is really good\nand I mix that up, I put those in there\nand sometimes I put some cinnamon on them.\nAnd as I'm describing this,\nI'm getting hungry for Magic Spoon.\nSo if you want to try Magic Spoon,\nyou can go to magicspoon.com/huberman\nto get their variety pack.\nJust use the promo code\nHuberman at checkout\nto get $5 off your order.\nAgain, that's magicspoon.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman to get $5 off.\nAnd now for my discussion with\nDr. David Berson, welcome.\n- Thank you.\n- Yeah.\n- So nice to be here.\n- Great to have you.\nFor more than 20 years\nyou've been my go-to source\nfor all things, nervous\nsystem how it works,\nhow it's structured.\nSo today I want to ask you\nsome questions about that.\nI think people would gain a lot\nof insight into this machine\nthat makes them think and\nfeel and see, et cetera.\nIf you would, could\nyou tell us how we see?\nA photon of light enters\nthe eye, what happens?\n- Right.\n- How is it that I look\noutside, I see a truck drive by,\nor I look on the wall I\nsee a photo of my dog,\nhow does that work?\n- Right, so this is an\nold question obviously.\nAnd clearly in the end,\nthe reason you have a visual experience\nis that your brain is got\nsome pattern of activity\nthat associates with the\ninput from the periphery.\nBut you can have a visual experience\nwith no input from the periphery as well.\nWhen you're dreaming, you're seeing things\nthat aren't coming through your eyes.\n- Are those memories?\n- I would say in a sense\nthey may reflect your visual experience\nthey're not necessarily\nspecific visual memories,\nbut of course they can be.\nBut the point is, that\nthe experience of seeing\nis actually a brain phenomenon.\nBut of course, under normal circumstances,\nwe see the world because\nwe're looking at it\nand we're using our eyes to look at it.\nAnd fundamentally, when we're\nlooking at the exterior world,\nit's what the retina is\ntelling the brain that matters.\nSo there are cells called ganglion cells,\nthese are neurons that are the\nkey cells for communicating\nbetween eye and brain, the\neye is like the camera,\nit's detecting the initial image,\ndoing some initial processing,\nand then that signal gets\nsent back to the brain proper\nand of course, it's there\nat the level of the cortex\nthat we have this conscious\nvisual experience.\nThere are many other places in the brain\nthat get visual input as\nwell doing other things\nwith that kind of information.\n- So I get a lot of\nquestions about color vision.\nIf you would, could you explain\nhow is it that we can perceive\nreds and greens and blues\nand things of that sort.\n- Right, so the first thing\nto understand about light,\nis that it's just a form of\nelectromagnetic radiation,\nit's vibrating, it's oscillating, but.\n- When you say it's\nvibrating, it's oscillating,\nyou mean that photons are actually moving?\n- Well in a sense, photons\nthey're certainly moving\nthrough space, we think\nabout photons as particles\nand that's one way of\nthinking about light,\nbut we can also think of it\nas a wave like a radio wave,\neither way is acceptable.\nAnd the radio waves have frequencies\nlike the frequencies\non the your radio dial,\nand certain frequencies in\nthe electromagnetic spectrum\ncan be detected by neurons in the retina,\nthose are the things we see,\nbut there's still different\nwavelengths within the light\nthat can be seen by the eye.\nAnd those different wavelengths\nare unpacked in a sense\nor decoded by the nervous system\nto lead to our experience of color.\nEssentially, different\nwavelengths give us the sensation\nof different colors through the auspices\nof different neurons that are tuned\nto different wavelengths of light.\n- So when a photon, so\nwhen a little bit of light\nhits my eye goes in,\nthe photoreceptors convert\nthat into electrical signal?\n- Right.\n- How is it that a given photon of light\ngives me the perception eventually,\nleads the perception of red\nversus green versus blue?\n- Right, so if you imagine\nthat in the first layer\nof the retina where this\ntransformation occurs\nfrom electromagnetic\nradiation into neural signals\nthat you have different\nkinds of sensitive cells\nthat are expressing, they're\nmaking different molecules\nwithin themselves for this express purpose\nof absorbing photons\nwhich is the first step\nin the process of seeing, now\nit turns out that altogether,\nthere are about five proteins like this\nthat we need to think about\nin the typical retina,\nbut for seeing color\nreally it's three of them.\nSo they're three different proteins,\neach absorbs light with a\ndifferent preferred frequency,\nand then the nervous system\nkeeps track of those signals\ncompares and contrasts them\nto extract some understanding\nof the wavelength composition of light.\nSo you can see just by\nlooking at a landscape,\nor it must be late in the day\nbecause things are looking golden\nthat's all a function of\nour absorbing the light\nthat's coming from the world\nand interpreting that with our brain\nbecause of the different\ncomposition of the light\nthat's reaching our eyes.\n- Is it fair to assume\nthat my perception of red\nis the same as your perception of red?\n- Well, that's a great question.\n- And that mine is better?\nI'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.\n[laughs]\n- It's a great question, it's\na deep philosophical question.\nIt's a question that really\nprobably can't even ultimately\nbe answered by the usual\nempirical scientific processes,\n'cause it's really about\nan individual's experience.\nWhat we can say is that\nthe biological mechanisms\nthat we think are important\nfor seeing color for example,\nseem to be very highly similar\nfrom one individual to the next\nwhether it be human beings,\nor other animals.\nAnd so we think that the\nphysiological process\nlooks very similar on the front end,\nbut once you're at the level\nof perception or understanding\nor experience, that's something\nthat's a little bit tougher\nto nail down with the sorts\nof scientific approaches\nthat we approach biological\nvision let's say.\n- You mentioned that there\nare five different cone types\nessentially, the cones being\nthe cells that absorb light\nof different wavelengths.\nI often wondered when I had my dog,\nwhat he saw and how his vision\ndiffers from our vision.\nAnd certainly, there are\nanimals that can see things\nthat we can't see.\n- Right?\n- What are some of the more\noutrageous examples of that?\n- I've seen things.\n- And same things in the extreme.\n- Right.\n- Dogs I'm guessing see reds\nmore as oranges, is that right?\n'Cause they don't have the\nsame array of of neurons\nthat we have for seeing color.\n- Right, so the first thing is,\nit's not really five types of colons,\nthere are really three types of colons.\nAnd if you look at the\nway that color vision\nis thought to work, you can sort of see\nthat it has to be three different signals.\nThere are a couple of\nother types of pigments.\nOne is really mostly for dim light vision.\nWhen you're walking\naround in a moonless night\nand you're seeing things\nwith very low light\nthat's the rod cell that\nuses its own pigment.\nAnd then there's another class of pigments\nwe'll probably talk\nabout a little bit later,\nthis melanopsin pigment.\n- I thought you were\nreferring to like ultraviolet\nand infrared and things like that.\n- Right, so in the case of a typical,\nwell, let's put it this way.\nIn human beings, most of\nus have three cone types\nand we can see colors that stem from that.\nIn most mammals including\nyour dog or your cat,\nthere really are only two cone types\nand that limits the kind of\nvision that they can have\nin the domain of wavelength\nor color as you would say.\nSo really, a dog sees the\nworld kind of like a particular\nkind of color blind human\nmight see the world,\nbecause instead of having\nthree channels to compare\nand contrast they only have two channels\nand that makes it much more\ndifficult to figure out exactly\nwhich wavelength you're looking at.\n- Do colorblind people\nsuffer much as a consequence\nof being colorblind?\n- Well, it's like so\nmany other disabilities.\nThe world is built for people\nof the most common type.\nSo in some cases, the\nexpectation can be there\nthat somebody can see something\nthat they won't be able to\nif they're missing one of\ntheir cone types let's say.\nSo in those moments, that\ncan be a real problem.\nIf there's a lack of contrast\nto their visual system,\nthey will be blind to that.\nIn general, it's a fairly\nmodest visual limitation\nas things go.\nFor example, if not\nbeing able to see acutely\ncan be much more damaging,\nnot being able to read\nfine print for example.\n- Yeah, I suppose if I had to give up\nthe ability to see certain colors\nor give up the ability to see clearly,\nI could certainly trade\nout color for clarity.\n- Right, of course, color\nis very meaningful to us\nas human beings, so we\nwould hate to give it up.\nBut obviously, dogs and cats\nand all kinds of other mammals\ndo perfectly well in the world.\n- Yeah, because we take care of them.\nI spent most of my time\ntaking care of that dog.\n- He took care of me too.\nLet's talk about that odd photopigment.\nPhotopigment of course being\nthe thing that absorbs light\nof a particular wavelength,\nand let's talk about these\nspecialized ganglion cells\nthat communicate certain\ntypes of information\nfrom eye to the brain\nthat are so important\nfor so many things.\nWhat I'm referring to here of course is,\nyour co-discovery of the so-called\nintrinsically photosensitive cells,\nthe neurons in the eye that\ndo so many of the things\nthat don't actually have\nto do with perception,\nbut have to do with important\nbiological functions.\nWhat I would love for you to do\nis explain to me why once I heard you say\nwe have a bit of fly eye in our eye.\n- Yeah.\n- And you showed this slide\nof a giant fly from a horror movie.\n- Yeah.\n- Trying to attack this woman.\n- Yeah.\n- And maybe it was an eye also.\nSo what does it mean that\nwe have a bit of a fly eye\nin our eye?\n- Yeah, so this last pigment\nis a really peculiar one.\nOne can think about it\nas really the initial\nsensitive element in a system\nthat's designed to tell your brain\nabout how bright things are in your world.\nAnd the thing that's really\npeculiar about this pigment,\nis that it's in the\nwrong place in a sense.\nWhen you think about the\nstructure of the retina,\nyou think about a layer cake essentially.\nYou've got this thin membrane\nat the back of your eye,\nbut it's actually a stack of thin layers\nand the outermost of those layers\nis where these photoreceptors\nyou were talking about\nearlier are sitting.\nThat's where the film of\nyour camera is essentially,\nthat's where the photons do their magic\nwith the photo pigments and\nturn it into a neural signal.\n- I like that I've never really thought\nof the photoreceptors is\nthe film of the camera,\nbut that makes sense.\n- Or like the sensitive chip\non CCD chip in your cell phone.\nIt's the surface on which\nthe light pattern is imaged\nby the optics of the eye,\nand now you've got an array of sensors\nthat's capturing that information\nand creating a bitmap essentially,\nbut now it's in neural signals\ndistributed across the\nsurface of the retina.\nSo all of that was known to\nbe going on 150 years ago,\na couple of types of\nphotoreceptors cones and rods.\nIf you look a little bit more closely,\nthree types of cones, that's\nwhere the transformation\nfrom electromagnetic\nradiation to neural signals\nwas thought to take place.\nBut it turns out that\nthis last photopigment\nis in the other end of the retina,\nthe innermost part of the retina,\nthat's where the so-called\nganglion cells are.\nThose are the cells\nthat talk to the brain,\nthe ones that actually\ncan communicate directly\nwhat information comes to\nthem from the photoreceptors.\nAnd here you've got a case where actually,\nsome of the output neurons\nthat we didn't think had any business\nbeing directly sensitive to light\nwere actually making this\nphotopigment, absorbing light,\nand converting that to neural signals\nand sending it to the brain.\nSo that made it pretty\nsurprising and unexpected,\nbut there are many surprising\nthings about these cells.\n- So, and what is the\nrelationship to the fly eye?\n- Right, so the link there is,\nthat if you ask how the photopigment\nnow communicates downstream\nfrom the initial absorption event\nto get to the electrical signal,\nthat's a complex cellular process\ninvolves many chemical steps.\nAnd if you look at how\nphotoreceptors in our eyes work,\nyou can see what that cascade\nis, how that chain works.\nIf you look in the eyes\nof flies or other insects\nor other invertebrates,\nthere's a very similar kind of chain.\nBut the specifics of how the signals\nget from the absorption\nevent by the pigment\nto the electrical response\nthat the nervous system can understand,\nare characteristically different\nbetween fuzzy furry creatures like us\nand insects for example like the fly.\n- I see.\n- So these funny extra photoreceptors\nthat are in the wrong layer\ndoing something completely different\nare actually using a chemical cascade\nthat looks much more\nlike what you would see\nin a fly photoreceptor,\nthan what you would see\nin a human photoreceptor,\na rod or a cone for example.\nSo it sounds like it's a very\nprimitive aspect of biology\nthat we maintain.\n- Exactly right, exactly.\n- And despite the fact that\ndogs can't see as many colors\nas we can and cats can't see\nas many colors as we can,\nwe have all this extravagant\nstuff for seeing color\nand then you got this other pigment\nsitting in the wrong not wrong,\nbut in a different part of the eye\nsending processing light very differently.\n- Right.\n- And sending that\ninformation into the brain.\nSo, what do these cells do?\nPresumably, they're there for a reason.\n- They are, and the\ninteresting thing is that,\none cell type like this\ncarrying one kind of signal\nwhich I would call a\nbrightness signal essentially,\ncan do many things in the brain.\n- When you say brightness\nsignal you mean that,\nlike right now, I have these\ncells do I have these cells?\nOf course.\n- You do.\n- I'm joking, I hope I\nhave these cells in my eye.\nAnd they're paying attention\nto how bright it is overall,\nbut they're not paying attention\nfor instance to the edge of area\nor what else is going on in the room.\n- Right, so it's the difference\nbetween knowing what the\nobjects are on the table\nand knowing whether it's bright enough\nto be daylight right now.\nSo why does your nervous\nsystem need to know\nwhether it's daylight right now?\nWell, one thing that needs to know\nthat is your circadian clock.\nIf you travel across time zones to Europe,\nnow your internal clock\nthinks it's California time,\nbut the rotation of the earth\nis for different part of the planet.\nThe rising and setting of the sun\nis not at all what your\nbody is anticipating.\nSo you've got an internal representation\nof the rotation of the\nearth in your own brain,\nthat's your circadian\nsystem it's keeping time.\nBut now you've played a\ntrick on your nervous system,\nyou put yourself in a different place\nwhere the sun is rising\nat the quote wrong time.\nWell, that's not good for you, right?\nSo you got to get back on track.\nOne of the things this system does,\nis sends a oh, it's daylight\nnow signal to the brain,\nwhich compares with its internal clock.\nAnd if that's not right, it\ntweaks the clock gradually\nuntil you get over your jet lag\nand you feel back on track again.\n- So the jet lag case\nmakes a lot of sense to me,\nbut presumably, these elements\ndidn't evolve for jet lag.\n- Right.\n- So, what are they doing\non a day-to-day basis?\n- Right, well one way to\nthink about this is that,\nthe clock that you have\nin not just your brain,\nin all the cells, almost all\nof the cells of your body,\nthey're all oscillating, they're all.\n- They got local little clocks in them.\n- They got local little\nclocks in themselves,\nthey're all clocks.\nThey need to be\nsynchronized appropriately,\nand the whole thing has to be\nbuilt in biological machinery.\nThis is actually a beautiful\nstory about how gene expression\ncan control gene expression,\nand if you set it up right,\nyou can set up a little thing\nthat just sort of hums along\nat a particular frequency.\nIn our case it's humming\nalong at 24 hours,\n'cause that's how our earth rotates\nand it's all built into our biology.\nSo this is great, but the reality is,\nthat the clock can only be so good.\nI mean, we're talking about biology here.\nIt's not precision engineering,\nand so it can be a little bit off.\n- Well, also it's in our brain,\nso it doesn't have access to\nany regular unerring signal?\n- Well, if in the absence of the rising\nand setting of the sun it doesn't,\nif you put someone in a cave,\ntheir biological clock will keep time\nto within a handful of\nminutes of 24 hours,\nthat's no problem for one day.\nBut if this went on\nwithout any correction,\neventually you'd be out of phase\nand this is actually one of the things\nthat blind patients often complain about.\nIf they've got retinal\nblindness is insomnia.\n[indistinct]\nExactly, they're not synchronized,\ntheir clock is there,\nbut they're drifting out of phase\nbecause their clock's only good\nto 24.2 hours or 23.8 hours\nlittle by little if they're drifting.\nSo you need a synchronization signal.\nSo even if you never across time zones\nand of course we didn't\nback on the Savannah\nwe stayed within walking\ndistance of where we were,\nyou still need a synchronizer,\n'cause otherwise,\nyou have nothing to actually confirm\nwhen the rising and the\nsetting of the sun is,\nthat's what you're trying\nto synchronize yourself to.\n- I'm fascinated by the circadian clock\nand the fact that all\nthe cells of our body\nhave essentially a\n24-hour-ish clock in them.\n- Right.\n- We hear a lot about\nthese circadian rhythms\nand circadian clocks the\nfact that we need light input\nfrom these special neurons\nin order to set the clock.\nBut I've never really heard it described\nhow the clock itself works\nand how the clock signals\nto all the rest of the body\nwhen the liver should be doing one thing\nand the stomach should be doing another.\nI know you've done some work on the clock.\nSo if you would just\nmaybe briefly describe\nwhere the clock is, what it does,\nand some of the top contour\nof how it tells the cells\nof the body what to do.\n- Right, so the first thing\nto say is that, as you said,\nthe clock is all over the place.\nMost of the tissues in\nyour body have clocks.\n- We probably have what,\nmillions of clocks in our body.\n- Yeah, I would say that's probably fair.\nIf you have millions of cell types,\nyou might have millions of clocks.\nThe role of the central pacemaker\nfor the circadian system\nis to coordinate all of these.\nAnd there's a little nucleus,\na little collection of\nnerve cells in your brain\nit's called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus the SCN,\nand it is sitting in a funny place\nfor the rest of the structures\nin the nervous system\nthat get direct retinal input.\nIt's sitting in the hypothalamus,\nwhich you can think about as\nsort of the great coordinator\nof drives and.\n- The source of all our\npleasures and all our problems.\n- Right.\n- Or most our problems.\n- Yes, it really is.\nBut it's sort of deep in your brain\nthings that drive you to do things.\nIf you're freezing cold, you\nput on a coat, you shiver,\nall these things are\ncoordinated by hypothalamus.\nSo this pathway that we're\ntalking about from the retina\nand from these peculiar cells\nthat are encoding light intensity,\nare sending signals directly into a center\nthat's surrounded by all of these centers\nthat control autonomic nervous system\nand your hormonal systems.\nSo this is a part of your visual system\nthat doesn't really reach\nthe level of consciousness,\nit's not something you think about,\nit's happening under the\nradar kind of all the time\nand the signal is working its way\ninto this central clock\ncoordinating center.\nNow what happens then is\nnot that well understood,\nbut it's clear that\nthis is a neural center\nthat has the same ability to communicate\nwith other parts of your brain\nas any other neural center.\nAnd clearly, there are circuits\nthat involve connections\nbetween neurons that are conventional.\nBut in addition, it's quite clear\nthat there are also\nsort of humeral effects\nthat things are being oozing\nout of the cells in the center\nand maybe into the circulation\nor just diffusing through\nthe brain to some extent\nthat can also affect neurons elsewhere.\nBut the hypothalamus uses everything\nto control the rest of the body.\nAnd that's true, the supracosmetic nucleus\nthis circadian center as well,\nit can get its fingers into\nthe autonomic nervous system,\nthe humeral system and of\ncourse, up to the centers\nof the brain that organize\ncoordinated rational behavior.\nSo if I understand correctly,\nwe have this group of cells,\nthe suprachiasmatic nucleus,\nit's got a 24-hour rhythm,\nthat rhythm is more or less matched\nto what's going on in our external world\nby the specialized set\nof neurons in our eye.\nBut then the master clock itself the SCN,\nreleases things in the\nblood humeral signals\nthat go out various places in the body.\nAnd you said to the autonomic system\nwhich is regulating more or\nless how alert or calm we are,\nas well as our thinking and our cognition.\nSo I'd love to talk to you\nabout the autonomic part,\npresumably that's through melatonin,\nit's through adrenaline\nhow is it that this clock\nis impacting how the autonomic system,\nhow alert or calm we feel?\n- Right, so there are pathways\nby which the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus can access\nboth the parasympathetic and\nsympathetic nervous system.\n- Just so people know the\nsympathetic nervous system\nis the one that tends\nto make us more alert,\nand the parasympathetic nervous system\nis the portion of the\nautonomic nervous system\nmakes us feel more calm.\n- Right.\n- In broadcasting.\nRight, to first approximation, right?\nSo, this is both of these systems\nare within the grasp\nof the circadian system\nthrough hypothalamic circuits.\nOne of the circuits that will be I think,\nof particular interest\nto some of your listeners\nis a pathway that involves\nthis sympathetic branch\nof the autonomic nervous system\nthe fight or flight system\nthat is actually through\na very circuitous route\ninnervating the pineal gland\nwhich is sitting in the\nmiddle of your brain.\n- The so-called third eye.\n- Right, so this is.\n- We'll have to get back to\nwhy it's called the third eye,\nbecause, yeah.\n- That's an interesting thing.\n- You can't call something\nthe third eye and just.\n- Just leave it there.\n- Just leave it there.\n- Right.\n- Right.\n- Anyway, this is the\nmajor source of melatonin\nin your body.\n- So light comes in to my eye.\n- Yes.\n- Passed off to the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus\nessentially, not the light itself,\nbut the signal representing the light.\n- Sure.\n- Then the SCN, the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus\ncan impact the melatonin system.\n- Right.\n- Via the pineal?\n- Right, the way this is seen is that,\nif you were to measure\nyour melatonin level\nover the course of the day,\nif you could do this hour by hour,\nyou'd see that it's\nreally low during the day,\nvery high at night.\nBut if you get up in\nthe middle of the night\nand go to the bathroom\nand turn on the bright\nfull fluorescent light,\nyour melatonin level is\nslammed to the floor.\nLight is directly impacting\nyour hormonal levels\nthrough this mechanism\nthat we just described.\nSo this is one of the routes\nby which light can act\non your hormonal status\nthrough pathways that\nare completely beyond\nwhat you normally would\nthink about, right?\nYou're thinking about the\nthings in the bathroom.\nOh, there's the toothbrush,\nthere's the tube of toothpaste.\nBut meanwhile, this other\nsystem is just counting photons\nand saying oh wow, there's\na lot of photons right now\nlet's shut down the melatonin release.\n- This is one of the main reasons\nwhy I've encouraged people\nto avoid bright light exposure\nin the middle of the night.\nNot just blue light, but\nbright light of any wavelength,\nbecause there's this myth\nout there that blue light\nbecause it's the optimal signal\nfor activating this pathway\nand shutting down melatonin,\nis the only wavelength of\nlight that can shut it down.\nBut am I correct in thinking that\nif a light is bright enough.\n- Right.\n- It doesn't matter if it's\nblue light, green light,\npurple light, even red light.\n- Right.\n- You're going to slam\nmelatonin down to the ground\nwhich is not a good thing to happen\nin the middle of the night.\n- Right.\n- Correct?\nRight, yeah, any light\nwill affect the system\nto some extent, the blue light\nis somewhat more effective,\nbut don't fool yourself into thinking\nthat if you use red light\nthat means you're avoiding the effect,\nit's certainly still there.\nAnd certainly, if it's very bright,\nit'll be more effective\nin driving the system\nthan dim blue light would be.\n- Interesting, a lot of\npeople wear blue blockers.\n- Right.\n- And in a kind of odd twist\nof misinformation out there,\na lot of people wear blue blockers\nduring the middle of the day,\nwhich basically makes no sense\nbecause during the middle of the day\nis when you want to get\na lot of bright light\nand including blue light\ninto your eyes, correct?\n- Absolutely, and not just for the reasons\nwe've been talking about in\nterms of circadian effects,\nthere are major effects of light on mood.\nAnd seasonal affective\ndisorder apparently,\nis essentially a reflection of\nthis same system in reverse.\nIf you're living in the northern climes\nand you're not getting that much light\nduring the middle of\nthe winter in Stockholm,\nyou might be prone to depression\nand phototherapy might be\njust the ticket for you\nand that's because there's a\ndirect effect of light on mood,\nthere's an example where if\nyou don't have enough light\nit's a problem.\nSo I think you're exactly right.\nIt's not about is like\ngood or bad for you,\nit's about what kind of light and when\nthat makes the difference.\nYeah, the general rule of\nthumb that I've been living by,\nis to get as much bright light in my eyes\nideally from sunlight\nanytime I want to be alert.\n- Right.\n- And doing exactly the opposite\nwhen I want to be asleep.\n- Yeah.\n- We're getting drowsy.\n- And there are aspects\nof this that spin out\nway beyond the conversation\nwe're having now\nto things like this.\nIt turns out that the incidence of myopia.\n- Nearsightedness.\n- Nearsightedness, right.\nIs strongly related to the amount of time\nthat kids spend outdoors.\n- In what direction of effect?\n- The more they spend time outdoors,\nthe less nearsightedness they have.\n- So this is not because\nthey're viewing things\nat a distance,\nor because they're getting a\nlot of blue light, sunlight?\n- It's a great question,\nit is not fully resolved\nwhat the epidemiological,\nwhat the basis of that\nepidemiological finding is,\none possibility is the amount of light\nwhich would make me think\nabout this melanopsin system again.\nBut it might very well be\na question of accommodation\nthat is the process by which\nyou focus on near or far things\nif you're never outdoors,\neverything is nearby.\nIf you're outdoors, you're\nfocusing far, so this is.\n- Or unless you are on your phone?\n- Right, exactly.\n- There's a tremendous\namount of interest these days\nin watches and things that count steps.\nI'm beginning to realize\nthat we should probably have a\ndevice that can count photons\nduring the day.\n- Right.\n- And can also count photons at night\nand tell us hey, you're\ngetting too many photons,\nyou're going to shut down\nyour melatonin at night,\nor you're not getting enough photons,\ntoday you didn't get enough bright light,\nwhether or not it's from\nartificial light or from sunlight.\nI guess that, where would you put?\nI guess you put on the top of your head\nor you'd probably want it\nsomeplace outward facing?\n- Right, probably what you\nneed is as many photons\nover as much of the retina as possible\nto recruit as much of\nthe system as possible.\n- In thinking about other effects\nof this non-image forming pathway\nthat involves these special\ncells in the eye and the SCN,\nyou had a paper a few years ago\nlooking at retinal input\nto an area of the brain\nwhich has a fancy name the peri-habenular,\nbut names don't necessarily matter\nthat had some important effects on mood\nand other aspects of light.\nMaybe you could tell us a little bit\nabout what is the peri-habenular?\n- Oh, wow, so that's a fancy term,\nbut I think the way to think about this,\nis a chunk of the brain\nthat is sitting as part of a bigger chunk\nthat's really the linker\nbetween peripheral sensory input\nof all kinds, virtually all kinds,\nwhether it's auditory\ninput or tactile input\nor visual input to the region\nof your brain the cortex\nthat allows you to\nthink about these things\nand make plans around\nthem and to integrate them\nand that kind of thing.\nSo, we've known about a pathway\nthat gets from the retina through\nthis sort of linker center\nwhich it's called the thalamus, and then.\n[indistinct]\nExactly, but you want to\narrive at the destination.\nRight now you're at grand central\nand now you can do your thing\n'cause you're up at the cortex.\nSo this is the standard pattern.\nYou have sensory input\ncoming from the periphery,\nyou've got these peripheral elements\nthat are doing the initial stages of.\n- The eye, the ear, the nose.\n- Your skin of your fingertips, right?\nThe taste buds on your tongue\nthey're taking this raw information in\nand they're doing some pre-processing\nmaybe or the early circuits are.\nBut eventually, most of these signals\nhave to pass through the\ngateway to the cortex\nwhich is the thalamus.\nAnd we've known for years,\nfor decades, many decades,\nwhat the major throughput\npathway from the retina\nto the cortex is and where it ends up.\nIt ends up in the visual cortex.\nYou pat the back of your head\nthat's where the receiving center is\nfor the main pathway\nfrom retina to cortex.\nBut wait a minute, there's more.\nThere's this little side pathway\nthat goes through a different part\nof that linking thalamus center.\n[indistinct]\n- Like a local train.\n- Yeah.\n- From grand central to.\n- It's in a weird part of\nthe neighborhood, right?\nIt's a completely different,\nit's like a little trunk line\nthat branches off and goes\nout into the hinterlands\nand it's going to the\npart of this linker center\nthat's talking to a completely\ndifferent part of cortex\nway up front, frontal lobe,\nwhich is much more involved\nin things like planning,\nor self-image or.\n- Self-image literally, how one.\n- Views oneself, do you\nfeel good about yourself,\nor what's your plan for next Thursday.\nIt's a very high level center\nin the highest level\nof your nervous system\nand this is the region\nthat is getting input\nfrom this pathway which is\nmostly worked out in its function\nby [indistinct] Tara's Lab.\nI know you had him on the podcast.\n- We didn't talk about this path.\n- This pathway at all right.\nSo Dale Fernandez and [indistinct]\nand the folks that work with them,\nwere able to show that this\npathway doesn't just exist\nand get you to a weird place.\nBut if you activate it at\nkind of the wrong time of day,\nanimals can become depressed.\nAnd if you silence it under\nthe right circumstances,\nthen weird lighting cycles that\nwould normally make them act\nsort of depressed, no\nlonger have that effect.\n- So it sounds to me like\nthere's this pathway from eye\nto this unusual train\nroute through the structure\nwe call the thalamus,\nthen up to the front of the brain\nthat relates to things of self-perception,\nkind of higher level functions.\nI find that really interesting,\nbecause most of what I think about\nwhen I think about these fancy,\nwell, or these primitive rather,\nneurons that don't pay attention\nto the shapes of things,\nbut instead to brightness I think of well,\nit regulates melatonin\nand circadian clock,\nmood, hunger, the really\nkind of vegetative stuff\nif you will.\n- Right.\n- And this is interesting\nbecause I think a lot of people\nexperience depression\nnot just people that live in Scandinavia\nin the middle of winter, and\nwe are very much divorced\nfrom our normal interactions with light.\nIt also makes me realize\nthat these intrinsically\nphotosensitive cells\nthat set the clock et cetera,\nare involved in a lot of things.\nThey seem to regulate a dozen\nor more different basic functions.\nI want to ask you about a different aspect\nof the visual system now,\nwhich is the one that relates\nto our sense of balance.\nSo I love boats but I hate being on them.\nI love the ocean from shore,\nbecause I get incredibly\nseasick, it's awful.\nI think I'm going to get seasick\nif I think about it too much.\n[laughs]\nAnd once I went on a boat trip,\nI came back and I actually got\nmotion sick or wasn't seasick\n'cause I was rafting.\nSo there's a system that\nsomehow gets messed up.\nThey always tell us if you're feeling sick\nto look at the horizon\net cetera, et cetera.\n- Right.\n- So what is the link\nbetween our visual system\nand our balance system\nand why does it make us nauseous sometimes\nwhen the world is moving in a way\nthat we're not accustomed to?\n- Right.\n- I realize this is a big question,\nbecause it involves eye\nmovement, et cetera.\n- Right.\n- But let's maybe just walk in\nat the simplest layers\nof vision, vestibular,\nso-called balance system\nand then maybe we can piece\nthe system together for people\nso that they can understand,\nand then also we should\ngive them some tools\nfor adjusting their nausea\nwhen their vestibular\nsystem is out of whack.\n- Cool, so the first thing to think about\nis that the vestibular system\nis designed to allow you\nto see how your or detect sense\nhow you're moving in the\nworld, through the world.\nIt's a funny one because\nit's about your movement\nin relationship to the world in a sense,\nand yet it's sort of interoceptive\nin the sense that it is really\nin the end sensing the\nmovement of your own body.\n- Okay, so interoception\nwe should probably delineate for people\nis when you're focusing\non your internal state\nas opposed to something outside you.\n- Right.\n- It's a gravity sensing system.\n- Well, it's partly a\ngravity sensing system\nin the sense that gravity is\na force that's acting on you\nas if you were moving through the world\nin the opposite direction.\n- All right, now you got to explain that.\nYou got to explain that to me.\n- Okay, so basically the idea is that,\nif we leave gravity inside,\nwe're just sitting in a car,\nin the passenger seat and the\ndriver hits the accelerator\nand you start moving\nforward, you sense that.\nIf your eyes were closed, you'd sense it.\nIf your ears were plugged\nin, your eyes would close,\nyou'd still know it.\n- Yeah, many people take\noff on the plane like this\nthey're dreading the flight\nand they know when the\nplane is taking off.\n- Sure, that's your\nvestibular system talking,\nbecause anything that jostles you out\nof the current position\nyou're in right now\nwill be detected by the\nvestibular system pretty much.\nSo this is a complicated system,\nbut it's basically in your inner ear\nvery close to where you're hearing.\n- That they put it there.\nAnd I don't know.\n- And I don't really know,\nthey're sort of derived.\n[indistinct]\n- Now I'm just kidding.\nTo steal our friend Russ\nVan Gelder's explanation,\nwe weren't consulted the\ndesign phase and no one.\n- That's a great [indistinct].\n- But it's interesting it's in the ear.\n- Yeah.\n- Right?\n- Yeah, it's deep in there\nand it's served by the same nerve actually\nthat serves the hearing system.\nOne way to think about it\nis both the hearing system\nand this vestibular\nself-motion sensing system\nare really detecting the signal\nin the same way they're hairy\ncells and they're exciting.\n[indistinct]\n- Yeah, sort of they got\nlittle cilia sticking up\noff the surfaces.\nAnd depending on which way you bend those,\nthe cells will either\nbe inhibited or excited,\nthey're not even neurons but\nthen they talk to neurons\nwith a neuron-like process and off you go.\nNow you've got an auditory signal\nif you're sensing things\nbouncing around in your cochlea\nwhich is.\n- Sound waves.\n- Sympathetically the\nbouncing of your eardrum\nwhich is symmetrically the\nsound waves in the world.\nBut in the case of the\nvestibular apparatus,\nevolution has built a system\nthat detects the motion of say\nfluid going by those hairs.\nAnd if you put a sensor\nlike that in a tube\nthat's fluid filled,\nnow you've got a sensor\nthat will be activated\nwhen you rotate that tube around the axis\nthat passes through the middle of it,\nthose we're just listening won't be able.\n[indistinct]\n- I was thinking of it\nas three hula hoops.\n- Right, three hoops.\n- One standing up, one\nlying down on the ground.\n- Right.\n- The other one the other way.\n- Three directions, the people who fly\nwill talk about roll pitch and\nyou all that kind of thing.\nSo three axes of encoding\njust like in the.\n[indistinct]\n- Sort of the yes, the no\nand then I always say\nit's the puppy head tilt.\n- Yeah, that puppy tilt.\n- That's the other one.\nSo the point is that,\nyour brain is eventually\ngoing to be able to unpack\nwhat these sensors are telling you\nabout how you just rotated your head\nin very much the way that\nthe three types of cones\nwe were talking about before\nare reading the incoming photons\nin the wavelength domain\ndifferently, and if.\n- Red, green, blue.\n- Yeah, you can compare and\ntrust you get red, green, blue.\nSo same basic idea if\nyou have three sensors\nand you array them properly,\nnow you can tell if you're\nrotating your head left or right,\nup or down that's the sensory signal\ncoming back into your brain\nconfirming that you've just\nmade a movement that you will.\n- But what about on the plane?\nBecause when I'm on the plane,\nI'm completely stationary\nthe plane's moving.\n- Right.\n- But my head hasn't moved.\n- Right.\n- So I'm just moving\nforward, gravity is constant.\n- Exactly.\n- How do I know I'm accelerating?\n- So what's happening now\nis your brain is sensing the motion,\nand the brain is smart\nenough also to ask itself,\ndid I will that movement or\ndid that come from the outside?\nSo now in terms of sort of understanding\nwhat the the vestibular signal means,\nit's got to be embedded in the context\nof what you tried to do,\nor what your other sensory\nsystems are telling you\nabout what's happening.\n- I see, so it's very interesting.\nBut it's not conscious or\nat least if it's conscious,\nit's very not conscious, it's\ndefinitely very fast, right?\nThe moment that plane starts moving,\nI know that I didn't get up out\nof my chair and run forward.\n- Right.\n- But I'm not really thinking about\ngetting up out of my chair I just know.\n- I guess the way i\nthink about it is that,\nthe nervous system is\nquote, aware at many levels\nwhen it gets all the way up to the cortex\nand we're thinking about it,\nyou're talking about it, that's cortical.\nBut the lower levels of the brain\nthat don't require you to\nactually actively think about it\nthey're just doing their thing\nare also made aware, right?\nA lot of this is happening\nunder the surface\nof what you're thinking,\nthese are reflexes.\n- Okay, so we've got this\ngravity sensing system?\n- Right.\n- I'm nodding for those that are listening\nfor a yes movement of the head,\na no movement of the head\nor the tilting of the head\nfrom side to side.\n- Right.\n- And then you said that\nknowledge about whether or not\nactivation of that system\ncomes from my own movements,\nor something acting upon\nme like the plane moving.\n- Right.\n- Has to be combined with other signals.\nAnd so, how is the visual information\nor information about the visual world\ncombined with balance information?\n- Right, so yeah.\nI guess maybe the best way to think about\nhow these two systems work together,\nis to think about what\nhappens when you suddenly\nrotate your head to the left.\nWhen you suddenly rotate\nyour head to the left,\nyour eyes are actually\nrotating to the right.\nAutomatically, you do\nthis in complete darkness.\nIf you had an infrared\ncamera and watched yourself\nin complete darkness,\nyou can't see anything.\nRotating your head to the left,\nyour eyes would rotate to the right.\nThat's your vestibular system saying,\nI'm going to try to compensate\nfor the head rotation.\nSo my eyes are still\nlooking in the same place.\nWhy is that useful, well,\nif it's always doing that,\nthen the image of the world on your retina\nwill be pretty stable most of the time\nand that actually helps vision.\n- Have they built this into\ncameras for image stabilization\n'cause when I move, when I\ntake a picture with my phone,\nit's blurry, it's not clear?\n- Well actually, you might\nwant to get a better phone,\nbecause now what they have is\nsoftware in the better apps\nthat will do a kind of\nimage stabilization post-hoc\nby doing a registration of the images\nthat are bouncing around,\nthey say the edge of the house was here,\nso let's get that aligned\nin each of your images.\nSo you may not be aware if\nyou're using a good new phone\nthat if you walk around a\nlandscape and hold your phone,\nthat there's all this image\nstabilization going on.\nBut it's built into standard\ncinematic technology now,\nbecause if we tried to\ndo a handheld camera,\nthings would be bouncing around,\nthings would be unwatchable,\nyou wouldn't be able to really understand\nwhat's going on in the scene.\nSo the brain works really hard\nto mostly stabilize the image\nof the world on your retina\nand of course you're\nmoving through the world\nso you can't stabilize everything.\nBut the more you can\nstabilize most of the time,\nthe better you can see.\nAnd that's why when we're scanning a scene\nlooking around at things,\nwe're making very rapid eye movements\nfor very short periods of\ntime and then we just rest,\nbut we're not the only ones that do that.\nIf you ever watch a hummingbird,\nit does exactly the same\nthing at a feeder, right?\n[indistinct]\nIt is with its body.\nIt's going to make a quick movement,\nand then it's going to be stable.\nAnd when you watch a pigeon\nwalking on the sidewalk,\nit does this funny head bobbing thing.\nBut what it's really doing,\nis racking its head back on its neck\nwhile its body goes forward\nso that the image of the\nvisual world stays static.\n- Is that why they're doing it?\n- Yes, and you've seen\nthe funny chicken videos\non YouTube, right?\n- You take a chicken move it up and down\nthe head stays in one place,\nit's all the same thing.\nAll of these animals are trying hard\nto keep the image of the\nworld stable on their retina\nas much of the time as they possibly can.\nAnd then when they've got\nto move, make it fast,\nmake it quick and then stabilize again.\n- That's why the pigeons\nhave their head back?\n- It is, yeah.\n- Wow.\n- Yeah.\n- I just need to pause there for a second\nand digest that, amazing.\nIn case people aren't.\nWell, there's no reason\nwhy people would know\nwhat we're doing here, but essentially,\nwhat we're doing is we're\nbuilding up from sensory\nlight onto the eye, make\ncolor to what the brain does\nwith the integration of\nthat circadian clock,\nmelatonin, et cetera.\nAnd now what we're doing\nis we're talking about\nmulti-sensory or multimodal\ncombining one sense vision\nwith another sense balance.\n- Right.\n- And it turns out that pigeons\nknow more about this than I do,\nbecause pigeons know\nto keep their head back\nas they walk forward.\n- Right.\n- All right, so that gets us to this issue\nof motion sickness.\n- Right.\n- And you don't have to go out on a boat.\nAnytime I go to New York, I sit in an Uber\nor in a cab in the back.\nAnd if I'm looking at my phone\nwhile the car is driving,\nI feel nauseous by time I\narrive at my destination.\n- Right.\n- I always try and look out\nthe front of the windshield,\nbecause I'm told that helps\nbut it's a little tiny window.\n- Right.\n- And I end up feeling slightly\nless sick if I do that.\nSo what's going on with the\nvision and the balance system\nthat causes a kind of a nausea?\nAnd actually, if I keep\ntalking about this.\n[indistinct]\n[laughs]\nI don't throw up easily, but\nfor some reason motion sickness\nis a real thing for me.\n- It's a problem for a lot of people.\nI think the fundamental problem typically,\nwhen you get motion sick\nis what they call visual\nvestibular conflict.\nThat is, you have two sensory systems\nthat are talking to your brain\nabout how you're moving through the world.\nAnd as long as they agree you're fine.\nSo if you're driving,\nyour body senses that\nyou're moving forward.\nYour vestibular system is picking up\nthis acceleration of the car,\nand your visual system is\nseeing the consequences\nof forward motion in the\nsweeping of the scene past you.\nEverything is honky-dory,\nright, no problem.\nBut when you are headed forward\nbut you're looking at your cell phone,\nwhat is your retina seeing?\nYour retina is seeing the\nstable image of the screen.\nThere's absolutely no motion in that.\n- Or the motion is just or some\nother emotion like a movie.\n- If you're playing a game\nor you're watching a video,\na football game, the motion is uncoupled\nwith what's actually\nhappening to your body.\nYour brain doesn't like that,\nyour brain likes everything to be aligned.\nAnd if it's not, it's\ngoing to complain to you.\n- By making me feel nauseous.\n- By making you feel nauseous\nand maybe you'll change your behavior.\nSo you're getting.\n- I'm getting punished.\n- Yeah, for setting it up.\n[indistinct]\n- Right.\n- By the vestibular?\n- You'll learn.\n- Visuals.\n[laughs]\nIn time, I love it.\nI love the idea of reward signals\nand we've done a lot of\ndiscussion about this\non this podcast of things like\ndopamine reward and things,\nbut also punishment signals\nand I love this example.\nWell, maybe marching a little bit further\nalong this pathway,\nvisual input is combined\nwith balance input.\nWhere does that occur,\nand maybe 'cause I have some\nhint of where it occurs.\nYou could tell us a little bit\nabout this kind of\nmysterious little mini-brain\nthat they call the cerebellum.\n- Cerebellum, yeah.\nSo the way I tried to describe\nthe cerebellum to my students\nis that, it serves sort of like\nthe air traffic control system\nfunctions in air travel.\nSo that it's a system\nthat's very complicated\nand it's really dependent\non great information.\nSo it's taking in information\nabout everything that's\nhappening everywhere\nnot only through your sensory systems,\nbut it's listening into\nall the little centers\nelsewhere in your brain\nthat are computing what\nyou're going to be doing next\nand so forth.\nSo it's just ravenous for\nthat kind of information.\n- So it really is like\na little mini-brain.\n- It is, it's got access\nto all those signals.\nand it really has an\nimportant role in coordinating\nand shaping movements, but\nif you suddenly eliminated\nthe air traffic control system,\nplanes could still take off and land\nbut you might have some unhappy\naccidents in the process.\nSo the cerebellum is kind of like that.\nIt's not that you would be paralyzed\nif your cerebellum was gone\nbecause you still have motor neurons,\nyou still have ways to\ntalk to your muscles,\nyou still have reflex centers,\nand it's not like you\nwould have any sensory laws\nbecause you still have your cortex\ngetting all of those beautiful signals\nthat you can think about,\nbut you wouldn't be coordinating\nthings so well anymore.\nThe timing between input\nand output might be off.\nOr if you were trying to\npractice a new athletic move\nlike an overhead serve in tennis,\nyou'd be just terrible at learning.\nAll the sequences of muscle movements\nand the feedback from\nyour sensory apparatus\nthat would let you really\nhit that ball exactly\nwhere you wanted to\nafter the nth rep, right?\nNow 1000th rep or something\nyou get much better at it.\nSo the cerebellum is all involved\nin things like motor learning\nand refining the precisions\nof movement so that they\nget you where you want to go\nif you reach for a glass of champagne\nthat you don't knock\nit over or stop short.\n[indistinct]\n- People who have selective\ndamage to the cerebellum.\n- Absolutely.\n- And I'm familiar with.\nWell, Korsakoff's is different, right?\nIsn't that a B vitamin\ndeficiency in chronic alcoholics?\n- Right.\n- And they tend to walk\nkind of bow-legged and they\ncan't coordinate their movements.\nThat has some that not memory\nbodies but also a cerebellum?\n- I'm not sure about the\ncerebellar involvement there.\nBut the typical thing would be a patient\nwho has a cerebral or stroke\nor a tumor for example,\nmight be not that steady on their feet\nif the dynamics of the\nsituation you're standing\non a street car with no\nhandle pull to hold on to,\nthey might not be as good at adjusting\nall the little movements of the car.\nThere's a kind of tremor that can occur\nas they're reaching for things,\nbecause they reach a little too far\nand then they over correct and\ncome back, things like that.\nSo it's very common neurological\nphenomenon actually.\nCerebellar ataxia is what\nthe neurologists call it,\nand it can happen not just\nwith cerebellar damage,\nbut damage to the tracts\nthat feed the information\ninto the cerebellum.\n- Right, it is the private structure.\n- Exactly, or output from the cerebellum.\n- And so, the cerebellum\nis where a lot of visual\nand balance information is combined.\n- In a very key place in the cerebellum,\nwhich it's really one of the oldest parts.\n- In terms of flocculus.\n- The flocculus, right.\nIt's a critical place in\nthe cerebellum where visual\nand vestibular information comes together\nrecording just the kinds of\nmovements we were talking about.\nThis image stabilizing network\nit's all happening there.\nAnd there's learning\nhappening there as well.\nSo that if your vestibular apparatus\nis a little bit damaged somehow,\nyour visual system is actually\ntalking to your cerebellum\nsaying there's a problem\nhere, there's an error,\nand your cerebellum is\nlearning to do better\nby increasing the output\nof the vestibular system\nto compensate for whatever that loss was.\nSo it's a little error correction system\nthat's sort of typical\nof a cerebellar function\nand it can happen in many,\nmany different domains.\nThis is just one of the domains\nof sensory motor integration\nthat takes place there.\n- So I should stay off\nmy phone in the Ubers.\nif I'm on a boat, I\nshould essentially look\nand as much as possible act\nas if I'm driving the machine.\n- Right.\n- That'd be weird\nif I was in the passenger seat\npretending I was driving the machine.\nBut i do always feel better\nif I'm sitting in the\nfront seat passenger.\n- Right, so more of the\nvisual world that you can see\nas if you were actually\nthe one doing the motion\nI would think.\n- Let's stay in the inner ear for a minute\nas we continue to march\naround the nervous system.\nWhen you take off in the\nplane or when you land\nor sometimes in the middle of there,\nyour ears get clogged or at\nleast my ears get clogged,\nthat's because of pressure\nbuildup in the various tubes\nof the inner ear, et\ncetera, we'll get into this.\nBut years ago, our good\nfriend Harvey Karten,\nis a another world-class neuroanatomist\ngave a lecture and talked\nabout how plugging your nose\nand blowing out versus plugging\nyour nose and sucking in\nshould be done at different times\ndepending on whether or not\nyou're taking off or landing.\nAnd I always see people\ntrying to unpop their ears.\n- Right.\n- And when you do scuba diving\nyou learn how to do this\nwithout necessarily I can do it\nby just kind of moving my jaw now\n'cause I've done a little bit of diving.\nBut what's the story there?\nWe don't have to get\ninto all the differences\nin atmospheric pressure, et cetera,\nbut if I'm taking off\nand my ears are plugged,\nI've recently ascended, plane\ntake off, my ears are plugged,\ndo I plug my nose and blow out,\nor do I plug my nose and suck in?\n- Right, so the basic idea is that,\nif your ears feel bad because\nyou're going into an area\nof higher pressure, so if\nthey pressurize the cabin\nmore than the pressure that\nyou have on the surface\nof the planet, your\neardrums will be bending in\nand they don't like that.\nIf you push them more\nthey'll hurt even more.\n- It's a good description\nthat the pressure goes up\nthen they're going to bend in.\n- Bend in and then reverse would be true\nif you go into an area of low pressure.\nSo if you knew you started\nto drive up the mountain side\nthe pressure's getting\nlower and lower outside,\nnow the air behind your\neardrum is ballooning out.\n- Yep.\n- Right?\nSo it's just a question\nof are you trying to get more\npressure or less pressure\nbehind the eardrum and there's\na little tube that does that\nand comes down into\nback your throat there.\nAnd if you force pressure up that tube,\nyou're going to be\nputting more air pressure\ninto the compartment.\n- To counter it.\n- If it's not enough and if you're sucking\nyou're going the other way.\nIn reality, I think as long\nas you open the passageway,\nI think the pressure differential\nis going to solve your problem.\nSo I think you could actually blow in\nwhen you're not supposed to.\n- Okay, so you could just hold\nyour nose and blow air out,\nor hold your nose and suck in the.\n- Right.\n- Effect either way is fine?\n- I think so.\n- Excellent, I just won\n$100 from Harvey Karten.\n[laughs]\n- Thank you very much, this is a lot.\nHarvey and I used to teach\nneuroanatomy together\nand I was like I don't think it matters,\nbut thank you very much,\nI'll split that with you.\n- Okay.\n[laughs]\n- This is important stuff.\nBut it's true you hear this.\nSo it doesn't matter either way.\n- I'm no expert in this area.\n- Don't worry.\n- Don't quote me.\n- He's not going to, well,\nI'm going to quote you.\nBut, okay, so we've talked\nabout the inner ear,\nwe've talked about the cerebellum.\nI want to talk about an area of the brain\nthat is rarely discussed\nwhich is the midbrain.\n- Yeah.\n- And for those that don't know,\nthe midbrain is an area\nbeneath the cortex.\nI guess we never really defined cortex\nwas kind of the outer layers\nor are the outer layers\nof the at least mammalian\nbrain or human brain.\nBut the midbrain is super interesting,\nbecause it controls a\nlot of unconscious stuff,\nreflexes, et cetera.\nAnd then there's this phenomenon\neven called blind sight.\nSo could you please tell\nus about the midbrain\nabout what it does, and\nwhat in the world is sight?\n- Yeah, so there's a lot of pieces there.\nI think the first thing to say is,\nif you imagine the nervous\nsystem in your mind's eye,\nyou see this big honking brain\nand then there's this little wand\nthat dangles down into your\nvertical column the spinal cord\nand that's kind of your visual impression.\nWhat you have to imagine is\nstarting in the spinal cord\nand working your way up into\nthis big magnificent brain\nand what you would do\nas you enter the skull,\nis get into a little place\nwhere the spinal cord\nkind of thickens out.\nIt still has that sort of long,\nskinny trunk-like feeling.\n- It's more like a\npaddle or a spoon shape.\n- Right, it starts to\nspread out a little bit\nand that's 'cause your evolutionists\npacked more interesting goodies in there\nfor processing information\nand generating movement.\nSo beyond that is this tween\nbrain we were talking about.\nThis linker brain with\ndiencephalon really means\nthe between brain.\n- Oh, I thought you said tween.\n- Well, it is, yes.\n- No, no, no, between.\nBetween.\n- Between.\n[indistinct]\n- You said tween.\n- Yeah, it's the between,\nit's the between brain\nis what the name means.\nIt's the linker from the\nspinal cord in the periphery\nup to these grand centers of the cortex.\nBut this midbrain you're\ntalking about is the last bit\nof this enlarged sort of spinal\ncordy thing in your skull,\nwhich is really the brain\nstem is what we call it.\nThe last bit of that before\nyou get to this relay up\nto the cortex is the midbrain.\nAnd there's a really\nimportant visual center there,\nit's called the superior colliculus.\nThere's a similar center in the brains\nof other vertebrate animals a\nfrog for example or a lizard,\nwould have this is called\nthe optic tectum there\nbut it's a center, then in\nthese non-mammalian vertebrates,\nis really the main visual center.\nThey don't really have what\nwe would call a visual cortex\nalthough there's something\nsort of like that.\nBut this is where most of the action is\nin terms of interpreting visual input\nand organizing behavior around that.\nYou can sort of think about this region\nof the brain stem as a reflex center\nthat can reorient the\nanimal's gaze or body\nor maybe even attention to\nparticular regions of space\nout there around the animal\nand that could be for\nall kinds of reasons.\nIt might be a predator just\nshowed up in one corner\nof the forest and you pick that up\nand you're trying to avoid it.\n- Or just any movement.\n- Any movement, right?\nIt might be that suddenly\nsomething splats on the page\nwhen you're reading a novel\nand your eye reflexively looks at it.\nYou don't have to think\nabout that, that's a reflex.\n- What if you throw me a ball\nbut I'm not expecting it?\n- Right.\n- And I just reach up\ntry and grab it touch it or not.\nIs that handled by the midbrain?\n- Well, that's probably not the midbrain\nalthough by itself, because\nit's going to involve\nall these limb movements,\nthis movement of your arm and body.\n- What about ducking\nif something's suddenly\nthrown in your head?\n- Sure, right, things like that\nwill certainly have a brainstem component,\na midbrain component,\nsomething looms and you duck.\nIt may not be the superior colliculus\nwe're talking about now,\nit might be another part\nof the visual midbrain.\nBut these are centers that emerged early\nin the evolution of brains like ours\nto handle complicated visual events\nthat have significance for the animal\nin terms of space, where is it in space?\nAnd in fact, this same center\nactually gets input from all\nkinds of other sensory systems\nthat take information\nfrom the external world\nfrom particular locations\nand where you might want to\neither avoid or approach things\naccording to their significance to you.\nSo you get input from the touch system,\nyou get input from the auditory system.\nI work for a while in rattlesnakes,\nthey get input from a\npart of their warm sensors\non their face, they're in\nthese little pits on the face.\n- To work on baby rattlesnakes, right?\n- They were adults.\n- Oh, I wasn't trying\nto diminish the danger.\nI thought for some reason\nthey were little ones.\n- No.\n- Why in the world\nwould you work on rattlesnakes?\n- Well, because they have a version\nof an extra receptive sensory system\nthat is they're looking out into the world\nusing a completely\ndifferent set of sensors.\nThey're using the same sensors\nthat would feel the warmth on your face\nif you stood in front of a bonfire.\nExcept, evolution has given them\nthis very nice specialized system\nthat lets them image where\nthe heat's coming from.\nYou can sort of do that anyway, right?\nIf you walk around the fire,\nyou can feel where the\nfire is from the heat\nhitting your face.\n- Is that the primary way\nin which they detect prey?\n- It's one of one of the major ways.\nAnd in fact, they use vision as well\nand they bring these two systems together\nin the same place in this tectum regions\nbrain stem, midbrain.\n- What's the tongue jutting\nabout when the snakes?\n- That I don't know.\nThat may be old factory, they're maybe.\n- They're sniffing the\nair with their tongue?\n- Yeah, there may be, 'cause.\n- On our drive you told me that\nflies actually taste things\nwith their feet.\n- They do, yeah.\n- That's so weird.\n- Yeah, they have taste receptors\nand lots of funny places.\nI want to pause here just for one second\nbefore we get back into the midbrain.\nI think what's so interesting\nin all seriousness\nabout taste receptors\non feet, heat sensors,\ntongues shutting out of snakes and vision\nand all this integration is that,\nit really speaks to the fact\nthat all these sensory neurons\nare trying to gather information\nand stuff it into a system\nthat can make meaningful\ndecisions and actions.\nAnd that it really doesn't\nmatter whether or not\nit's coming from eyes or ears\nor nose or bottoms of feet,\nbecause in the end, it's\njust electricity flowing in.\nAnd so it sounds like it's\nplaced on each animal,\nit always feels weird\nto call fly an animal.\nBut they are creatures, they are animals.\nIt's placed in different\nlocations on different animals\ndepending on the particular\nneeds of that animal.\n- Right, but how much more powerful\nif the nervous systems\ncan also cross-correlate\nacross sensory systems?\nSo if you've got a weak signal\nfrom one sensory system,\nyou're not quite sure\nthere's something there.\nAnd a weak signal from\nan another sensory system\nthat's telling you the same locations\nis a little bit interesting.\nThere might be something there\nif you've got those two together\nyou've got corroboration.\nYour brain now says it's much more likely\nthat that's going to be something\nworth paying attention to.\n- Right, so maybe I'm feeling some heat\non one side of my face\nand I also smell something\nbaking in the oven.\n- Right.\n- So now there's,\nit's neither is particularly\nstrong, but as you said,\nthere's some corroboration.\n- Right.\nAnd that corroboration\nis occurring in the midbrain.\n- Right, and then if you\nthrow things into conflict,\nnow the brain is confused\nand that may be where your\nemotion sickness comes from.\nSo it is great to have, as a brain,\nit's great to have as many\nsources of information\nas you can have, just like if you're a spy\nor a journalist, you don't\nwant as much information\nas you can get about what's out there,\nbut if things conflict,\nthat's problematic, right?\nYour sources are giving\nyou different information\nabout what's going on.\nNow you've got a problem on\nyour hands, what do you publish?\n- The midbrain is so fascinating.\nI don't want to eject us from the midbrain\nand go back to the vestibular system,\nbut I do have a question\nthat I forgot to ask\nabout the vestibular system which is,\nwhy is it that for many\npeople including me,\ndespite my motion sickness in cabs,\nthat there's a sense of pleasure\nin moving through space\nand getting tilted relative\nto the gravitational pull of the earth?\nFor me growing up it was skateboarding,\nbut people like to corner\nin cars, corner on bikes,\nmaybe for some people it's\ndone running or dance.\nBut what is it about moving through space\nand getting tilted a lot\nof surfers around here.\nGetting tilted that can tap\ninto some of the pleasure centers.\nDo we have any idea why\nthat would feel like?\n- I have no clue.\n- Is there dopaminergic\ninput to this system?\n- Well, the dopaminergic\nsystem gets a lot of places.\nIt's pretty much to some\nextent everywhere in the cortex\na lot more in the frontal lobe of course,\nbut that's just for starters.\nThere's basically dopaminergic\ninnervation most places\nin the central nervous system.\nSo there's the potential for\ndopamine urging involvement\nbut I really have no clue\nabout the tilting phenomenon.\n- People pay money to\ngo on roller coasters.\n- Right, well, I think that\nmay be as much about the thrill\nas anything.\n- Sure.\nAnd the falling reflex is\nvery robust in all of us\nwhen the visual world's going up very fast\nit usually means that we're falling.\n- Right.\n- But some people like that,\nsome people don't.\n- Right.\nAnd kids tolerate a lot more\nsort of vestibular craziness\nspinning around until they've dropped.\n- And I've friends, it always\nyou worries me a little bit\nthat they throw their kids.\nI'm not recommending anyone do this.\nWhen they're little like throwing the kids\nreally far back and forth,\nsome kids seem to love it.\n- Yeah, yeah, our son loved\nbeing shaken up and down\nvery vigorously, that's the only thing\nthat would calm him down sometimes.\n- Interesting, yeah, so I'm guessing\nwe can guess that maybe\nthere's some activation\nof the reward systems from.\n- Yeah.\n- Being moving through space.\n- Well, if you think\nabout how rewarding it is\nto be able to move through space\nand how unhappy people\nare who are used to that\nwho suddenly aren't able to do that,\nthere is a sense of agency, right?\nIf you can choose to move\nthrough the world and to tilt,\nthat's not only you're\nmoving through the world,\nbut you're doing it with a\ncertain amount of finesse,\nmaybe that's what it is.\nYou can feel like you're the\nmaster of your own movement\nin a way that you wouldn't\nif you're going straight.\nI'm just blowing smoke here, right?\n- Yeah, well, we can\nspeculate, that's fine.\nI couldn't help but ask the question.\nOkay, so if we move ourselves pun intended\nback into the midbrain,\nthe midbrain is combining\nall these different signals\nfor reflexive action.\nAt what point does this\nbecome deliberate action?\nBecause if I look at something\nI want and I want to pursue it,\nI'm going to go toward it\nand many times that's\na deliberate decision.\n- Right, so this gets\nvery slippery I think,\nbecause what you have to try to imagine\nis all these different parts of the brain\nworking on the problem of staying alive\nand surviving in the world,\nthey're working on the\nproblem simultaneously,\nand there's not one right\nanswer how to do that.\nBut one way to think about it is that,\nyou have high levels\nof your nervous system\nthat are very well designed to override\nan otherwise automatic\nmovement if it's inappropriate.\nSo if you imagine you've been\ninvited to tea with the queen\nand she hands you very fancy\nWedgewood teacup very thin.\n- Wedgewood teacup?\n- Yes, with very hot tea in it\nand you're burning your hand,\nyou probably will try to find\na way to put that back down\non the saucer rather than\njust dropping it on the floor\nbecause you're with the queen.\nYou're trying to be appropriate to that.\nSo you have ways of reining\nin automatic behaviors\nif they're going to be maladaptive.\nBut you also want the\nreflex to work quickly\nif it's the only thing\nthat's going to save you.\nThe looming object coming at your head,\nyou don't have time to think about that.\nSo this is the interplay\nin these hierarchically organized centers\nof the nervous system at the lowest level.\nYou've got the automatic\nsensors and centers\nand reflex arcs that will keep you safe\neven if you don't have\ntime to think about it,\nand then you've got the\nhigher center saying,\nwell, maybe we could do this as well\nor maybe we shouldn't\ndo that at all, right?\nSo you have all these different levels\noperating simultaneously\nand you need bi-directional communication\nbetween high-level, cognitive centers,\ndecision-making on the one hand,\nand these low-level very\nhelpful reflexive centers,\nbut they're a little bit\nrigid, a little hard-wired\nso they need some nuance.\nSo they're both of these\nthings are operating in tandem\nin real time, all the time in our brains\nand sometimes we listen\nmore to one than the other.\nYou've heard people in sports\ntalking about messing up\nat the play 'cause they over thought it.\nThinking too hard about it.\nThat's partly you've already\ntrained your cerebellum\nhow to hit a fastball\nright down the middle.\n- Right, and if you start looking\nfor something new or different,\nyou're going to mess up\nyour reflexive swing.\n- Right, if you're trying to think\nabout the physics of the\nball as it's coming at you,\nyou've already missed, right?\nBecause you're not using\nyour, all those reps\nhave built a kind of knowledge\nis what you want to rely on\nwhen you don't have enough\ntime to contemplate.\n- This is important and a great segue\nfor what I'd like to discuss next\nwhich is the basal ganglia.\nThis really interesting\nof the area of the brain\nthat's involved in go-type commands\nand behaviors instructing us to do things\nand no-go preventing us from doing things.\nBecause so much of motor\nlearning and skill execution\nand not saying the wrong thing\nor sitting still in class\nor as you use with the\ntea with the queen example\nfeeling discomfort involves\nsuppressing behavior\nand sometimes it's activating behavior.\n- Right.\n- A tremendous amount of online attention\nis devoted to trying to\nget people motivated.\nThis isn't the main focus of our podcast.\nWe touch on some of the\nunderlying neural circuits\nof motivation dopamine and so forth.\nBut so much of what people\nstruggle with out there\nare elements around\nfailure to pay attention.\n- Right.\n- Or challenges in paying attention\nwhich is essentially like\nputting the blinders on\nand they're getting a soda\nstraw view of the world\nand maintaining that for a about of work\nor something of that sort and\ntrying to get into action.\nSo of course, this is carried\nout by many neural circuits\nnot just the basal ganglia.\nBut what are the basal ganglia,\nand what are their primary\nroles in controlling\ngo type behavior and no-go type behavior?\n- Yeah, so the basal\nganglia are sitting deep\nin what you would call the forebrains\nor the highest levels of the brain.\nThey are sort of cousins\nto the cerebral cortex\nwhich we talked about as\nsort of the highest level\nof your brain, the thing\nyou're thinking with.\n- The cerebral cortex\nbeing the refined cousins\nand then you've got the.\n- Right.\n- The brute, yeah.\n- Yeah.\nThat's probably totally unfair, but.\n- That's right, I like the basal ganglia.\nI can relate to the\nbrutish parts of the brain.\nA little bit of hypothalamus,\na little bit of basal ganglia, sure.\n- We need it all, we need it all.\nAnd this area of the brain\nhas gotten a lot bigger\nas the cortex has gotten bigger\nand it's deeply intertwined\nwith cortical function.\nThe cortex can't really\ndo what it needs to do\nwithout the help of the\nbasal ganglia and vice versa.\nSo they're really intertwined.\nAnd in a way you can think\nabout this logically is saying,\nif you have the ability\nto withhold behavior\nor to execute it, how do\nyou decide which to do?\nWell, the cortex is going to\nhave to do that thinking for you.\nYou have to be looking\nat all the contingencies\nof your situation to decide\nis this a crazy move,\nor is this a really smart\ninvestment right now or what?\n- I don't want to go out\nfor a run in the morning,\nbut I'm going to make\nmyself go out for a run,\nor I'm having a great time out on a run\nand I know I need to get back\nbut I kind of want to go another mile.\n- I mean, another great example is that,\nthe marshmallow test for the little kids.\nThey can get two\nmarshmallows if they hold off\njust 30 seconds initially,\nthey can have one right away.\nBut if they can wait 30\nseconds, they got two.\nSo that's the no go because\ntheir cortex is saying,\nI would really like to have\ntwo more than having one.\nBut they're not going to get the two\nunless they can not reach for the one.\nSo they've got to hold off the action\nand that has to result\nfrom a cognitive process.\nSo the cortex is involved\nin this in a major way.\n- Yeah, as I recall in that experiment,\nthe kids used a variety of tools.\nSome would distract themselves.\nI particularly related to the kid\nthat would just put himself\nright next to the marshmallows\nand then some of the\nkids covered their eyes,\nsome of them would count or sing.\nYeah, so that's all very cortical, right?\nComing up with a novel strategy,\nsimple example that we're using here.\nBut of course, this is at\nplay anytime someone decides\nthey want to go watch\na motivational speech\nor something just a Steve\nJobs commencement speech\njust to get motivated\nto engage in their day.\n- Should I take this new job?\nIt's got great benefits,\nbut it's in a lousy part of the country.\n- Why do you think that some\npeople have a harder time\nrunning these go no-go circuits\nand other people seem to have\nvery low activation energy\nwe would say, they could\njust, they have a task,\nthey just lean into the task.\n- Right.\n- Whereas some people\ngetting into task completion\nor things of that sort is\nvery challenging for them?\n- Yeah, I think it's really just another,\nit's a special case of a\nvery general phenomenon\nwhich is brains are complicated.\nAnd the brains we have\nare the result of genetics\nand experience, and my genes\nare different from your genes\nand my experiences are\ndifferent from your experiences.\nSo the things that would\nbe easy or hard for us\nwon't necessarily be aligned,\nthey might just happen to be\njust because they are,\nbut the point is that,\nyou're dealt a certain set of cards,\nyou have certain set of\ngenes, you are handed a brain,\nyou don't choose your\nbrain it's handed to you.\nThen there's all this\nstuff you can do with it.\nYou can learn to have new\nskills or to act differently\nor to show more restraint\nwhich is kind of relevant\nto what we're talking about here.\nOr maybe show less restraint\nif your problem is\nyou're so buttoned down,\nyou never have any fun in life\nand you should loosen up a little bit.\n- Thank you, I appreciate that.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n[laughs]\nDavid's always encouraging me\nto have a little more fun in life.\n[laughs]\nSo basil ganglia they're\nkind of the disciplinarian\nor they're sort of the instructor\nconductor of sorts, right?\nGo, no-go, you be quiet, you start now.\n- I wish I knew more about\nthe basal ganglia than I do.\nMy sense is that, this system is key\nfor implementing the plans that\nget cooked up in the cortex,\nbut they also influence the plans\nthat the cortex is dishing out\nbecause this is a major source\nof information to the cortex.\nSo it becomes almost\nimpossible to figure out\nwhere the computation\nbegins and where it ends\nand who's doing what\nbecause these things are all interacting\nin a complex network, and it's all of it.\nIt's the whole network,\nit's not one is the leader\nand the other is the follower.\n- Right, of course, yeah,\nthese are all the structures\nthat we're discussing\nare working in parallel.\n- Right.\n- And there's a lot of changing crosstalk.\nI have this somewhat sick habit David.\nEvery day I try and do 21 no-gos.\nSo if I want to reach for my phone,\nI try and not do it just to\nsee if I can prevent myself\nfrom engaging in that\nbehavior, if it was reflexive,\nif it's something I want\nto do a deliberate choice,\nthen I certainly allow myself to do it.\n- Right.\n- I don't tend to have too\nmuch trouble with motivation\nwith go type functions,\nmostly because I'm so busy\nthat I'd wish I had more time\nfor more goes so to speak.\nBut do you think these circuits\nhave genuine plasticity in them?\n- Absolutely, everybody\nknows how they've learned\nover time to wait for the\ntwo marshmallows, right?\nYou don't have to have instant\ngratification all the time.\nYou're willing to do a job\nsometimes it isn't your favorite job\nbecause it comes with the territory\nand you want the salary that\ncomes at the end of the week\nor the end of the month, right?\nSo we can defer gratification.\nWe can choose not to say the thing\nthat we know is going\nto inflame our partner\nand create a meltdown for the next week.\nWe learn this control,\nbut I think these are\nskills like any other\nyou can get better at\nthem if you practice them.\nSo I think you're choosing\nto do that to spontaneously,\nis kind of a mental\npractice, it's a discipline,\nit's a way of building a\nskill that you want to have.\n- Yeah, I find it to be something\nthat when I engage in\na no-go type situation,\nthen the next time and the next time\nthat I find myself about\nto move reflexively,\nthere's a little gap in consciousness\nthat I can make a decision whether or not\nthis is really the best use of my time.\nBecause sometimes I wonder\nwhether or not all this business\naround attention certainly\nthere's the case of ADHD\nand clinical diagnosed ADHD.\nBut all the issue around\nfocus and attention\nis really that people just\nhave not really learned\nhow to short circuit a reflex.\nAnd so much of what makes us\ndifferent than rattlesnakes,\nor well, actually they\ncould be deliberate,\nbut from the other animals\nand is our ability to suppress reflex.\n- Yeah, well, that's the cortex.\nOr let's say the forebrain.\nCortex and basal ganglia\nare working together\nsitting on top of this lizard brain\nthat's giving you all these\ngreat adaptive reflexes\nthat help you survive.\nYou just hope you don't\nget the surprising case\nwhere the thing that your\nreflex is telling you\nis actually exactly the wrong thing\nand you make a mistake, right?\n[indistinct]\nRight, so that's what the cortex is for.\nIt's adding nuance and\ncontext and experience,\npast association and in\nhuman beings obviously,\nlearning from others\nthrough communication.\n- Well, I was, you went right to it\nand it was where I was going to go.\nSo let's talk about the cortex.\nWe've worked our way up\nthe so-called neuraxis\nas the aficionados will\nknow, so we're in the cortex.\nThis is the seat of our\nhigher consciousness,\nself-image, planning and action.\nBut as you mentioned, the\ncortex isn't just about that,\nit's got other regions that\nare involved in other things.\nSo maybe we should staying with vision,\nlet's talk a little bit\nabout visual cortex.\nYou told me an amazing\nstory about visual cortex\nand it was somewhat of a sad story\nunfortunately about\nsomeone who had a stroke\nto visual cortex.\nMaybe if you would share that story\nbecause I think it illustrates\nmany important principles\nabout what the cortex does.\n- Right, so the visual cortex\nyou could say the projection screen.\nThe first place where\nthis information streaming\nfrom the retina through this\nthalamus connecting linker\ngets played out for the highest\nlevel of your brain to see.\nIt's a representation,\nit's a map of things going\non in the visual world\nthat's in your brain.\nAnd when we describe a scene to a friend,\nwe're using this chunk of our\nbrain to be able to put words\nwhich are coming from a\ndifferent part of our cortex\nto the objects and movements\nand colors that we see\nin the world.\nSo that's a key part of\nyour visual experience\nwhen you can describe\nthe things you're seeing,\nyou're looking at your\nvisual cortex, and this is.\n- Could I just ask a quick question?\nSo right now because I'm\nlooking at your face.\n- Right.\n- As we're talking,\nthere are neurons in my brain\nmore or less in the\nconfiguration of your face\nthat are active as you move about.\nAnd what if I were to close\nmy eyes and just imagine,\nI do this all the time by the way David.\nI close my eyes and i\nimagine David Berson's face.\n[laughs]\nI don't tend to do that\nas often, maybe I should.\nBut you get the point, I'm\nnow using visualization\nof what you look like by way of memory.\n- Right.\n- If we were to image\nthe neurons in my brain,\nwould the activity of neurons\nresemble the activity of\nneurons that's present\nwhen I open my eyes and\nlook at your actual face?\n- This is a deep question,\nwe don't really have a full.\n- It seems like.\n[indistinct]\n- Yes, except you're talking\nabout looking in detail\nat the activity of\nneurons in a human brain\nand that's not as easy to do\nas it would be in some\nkind of animal model.\nBut the bottom line is that,\nyou have a spatial representation\nof the visual world\nlate as a map of the visual world\nlay down on the surface of your cortex.\nThe thing that's surprising is that,\nit's not one map, it's\nactually dozens of maps.\n- What do each of those maps do?\n- Well, we don't really have a\nfull accounting there either,\nbut it looks a little bit\nlike the diversification\nof the output neurons of the retina,\nthe ganglion cells we\nwere talking about before.\nThere are different\ntypes of ganglion cells\nthat are encoding different\nkinds of information\nabout the visual world,\nwe talk about the ones that\nwere encoding the brightness.\nbut other ones are\nencoding motion or color\nthese kinds of things, the\nsame kinds of specializations\nin different representations\nof the visual world\nin the cortex seem to be true.\nIt's a complex story, we don't\nhave the whole picture yet,\nbut it does look as if\nsome parts of the brain\nare much more important\nfor things like reaching for\nthings in the space around you.\nAnd other parts of the\ncortex are really important\nfor making associations between\nparticular visual things\nyou're looking at now\nand their significance.\nWhat is that object,\nwhat can it do for me,\nhow can I use it?\n- What about the really\nspecialized areas of cortex\nlike neurons that respond\nto particular faces,\nor neurons that I don't\nknow can help me understand\nwhere I am relative to\nsome other specific object?\n- Right, so these are\nour properties of neurons\nthat are extracted from detected\nby recording the activity\nof single neurons in\nsome experimental system.\nWhat's going on when you actually\nperceive your grandmother's face,\nis a much more complicated question\nand it clearly involves\nhundreds and thousands\nand probably millions of neurons\nacting in a cooperative way.\nSo you can pick out any one little element\nin this very complicated system\nand see that it's\nresponding differentially\nto certain kinds of visual patterns\nand you think you're seeing a glimpse\nof some part of the process\nby which you recognize\nyour grandmother's face.\nBut that's a long way from\na complete description\nand it certainly isn't\ngoing to be at the level\nof a magic single neuron\nthat has the special stuff\nto recognize your grandmother,\nit's going to be in some pattern\nof activity across many, many cells\nresonating in some kind of special way\nthat will represent the\ninternal memory of your mother.\n- So it's really incredible?\n- Yeah.\n- I mean that every time\nwe do this deep dive\nwhich we do from time to time,\nyou and I we kind of like\nmarch into the nervous system\nand explore how different\naspects of our life experiences\nis handled there and how it's organized.\nAfter so many decades of doing this,\nit still boggles my mind that\nthe collection of neurons\none through seven active\nin a particular sequence\ngives the memory of a particular face\nand run backwards seven through to one,\nit gives you a, it could be rattlesnake\npit viper heat sensing organs.\n- Right.\n- You were talking about earlier.\nSo it sounds,\nis it true that there's\na lot of multi-purposing\nof the circuitry, like we can't say\none area of the brain does A\nand another area of the brain does B.\nSo areas can multitask\nor have multiple jobs.\nThey can moonlight.\n- Right, but I think in my career,\nthe hard problem has been to square that\nwith the fact that things are specialized\nthat there are specific genes expressed\nin specific neurons that make\nthem make synaptic connections\nwith only certain other neurons.\nAnd that particular synaptic arrangement\nactually results in the\nprocessing of information\nthat's useful to the\nanimal to survive, right?\nSo it's not as if it's either\na big undifferentiated network\nof cells and looking at any one\nis never going to tell you anything\nthat's too extreme on the one hand,\nnor is it the case that\neverything is hardwired\nand every neuron has one function\nand this all happens in\none place in the brain,\nit's way more complicated and interactive\nand interconnected than that.\n- So we're not hardwired or soft-wired?\n- Both.\n- We're sort of,\nI don't know what the analogy\nshould be what substance\nwould work best David?\n- No idea there, but the idea is that,\nit's always network activity.\nThere's always many, many neurons involved\nand yet there's tremendous\nspecificity in the neurons\nthat might or might not be participating\nin any distributed\nfunction like that, right?\nSo you have to get your mind\naround the fact that\nit's both very specific\nand very non-specific at the same time.\nIt's a little tricky to do,\nbut I think that's kind\nof where the truth lies.\n- Yeah, and so this example\nthat you mentioned to me\nonce before about a woman\nwho had a stroke in visual cortex,\nI think it speaks to some of this.\n- Right.\n- Could you share with us that story?\n- Sure, so the point is\nthat, all those of us who see\nhave representations of the visual world\nin our visual cortex.\nWhat happens to somebody\nwhen they become blind\nbecause of problems in the\neye, the retina perhaps?\nYou have a big chunk of the cortex,\nthis really valuable [indistinct]\nfor neural processing\nthat has come to expect\ninput from the visual system\nand there isn't any anymore.\nSo you might think about\nthat as fallow land, right?\nIt's just used by the nervous system\nand that would be a pity,\nbut it turns out that it is in fact used.\nAnd the the case that you're\ntalking about is of a woman\nwho was blind from very early in her life\nand who had risen through the ranks\nto a very high level\nexecutive secretarial position\nin a major corporation.\nAnd she was extremely\ngood at braille reading\nand she had a braille typewriter\nand that's how everything was done.\nAnd apparently, she had a stroke\nand was discovered at work,\ncollapsed and brought her to the hospital.\nAnd apparently, the\nneurologist who saw her\nwhen she finally came to said,\n\"I've got good news and bad news.\"\nBad news is you've had a stroke,\nthe good news is that it\nwas in an area of your brain\nyou're not even using\nit's your visual cortex\nand I know you're blind from birth\nso there shouldn't be any issue here.\"\nThe problem was, she lost\nher ability to read braille.\nSo what appears to have been the case\nand this has been confirmed in other ways\nby imaging experiments in humans is that,\nin people who are blind\nfrom very early in birth,\nthe visual cortex gets repurposed\nas a center for processing\ntactile information.\nAnd especially if you train\nto be a good braille reader,\nyou're actually reallocating\nsomehow that real estate\nto your fingertips.\nA part of the cortex that\nshould be listening to the eyes.\nSo that's an extreme level of plasticity.\nBut what it shows, is the visual cortex\nis kind of a general\npurpose processing machine,\nit's good at spatial information\nand the skin of your fingers\nis just another spatial sense\nand deprived of any other input\nthe brain seems smart enough\nif you want to put it\nthat way to rewire itself\nto use that real estate\nfor something useful,\nin this case, reading braille.\n- Incredible, somewhat\ntragic, but incredible.\nAt least in that case tragic, yeah.\n- Very informative.\n- Very informative.\nAnd of course it can go the other way too.\n- Right.\n- Where people can gain function\nin particular modalities\nlike improved hearing or tactile function\nin the absence of vision.\n- Right.\n- Tell us about connectomes,\nwe hear about genomes,\nproteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms\nthese days.\n- Yeah.\n- What's a connectome\nand why is it valuable?\n- Yeah, so the connectome\nactually now has two meanings.\nSo I'll only refer to one\nthat is my passion right now.\nAnd that is really trying\nto understand the structure\nof nervous tissue at a scale\nthat's very, very fine.\n- Smaller than a millimeter.\n- Way smaller than a\nmillimeter, a nanometer or less,\nas that's 1,000 times smaller,\nor it's actually a million times smaller.\nSo really, really tiny\non the scale of individual synapses\nbetween individual neurons\nor even smaller like the\nindividual synaptic vesicles\ncontaining little packets\nof neurotransmitter\nthey're going to get it\nreleased to allow one neuron\nto communicate to the next.\nSo very, very fine, but\nthe notion here is that,\nyou're doing this section after\nsection at very fine scale.\nSo in theory what you have\nis a complete description\nof a chunk of nervous\ntissue that is so complete\nthat if you took enough time to identify\nwhere the boundaries of all the cells are,\nyou could come up with\na complete description\nof the synaptic wiring of\nthat chunk of nervous tissue\nbecause you have a complete description\nof where all the cells are\nand where all the synapses\nbetween where all the cells are.\nSo now you essentially\nhave a wiring diagram\nof this complicated piece of tissue.\nSo the omics part is\nthe exhaustiveness of it\nrather than looking at\na couple of synapses\nthat are interesting to you\nfrom two different cell types.\nYou're looking at all the\nsynapses of all of the cell types\nwhich of course is this massive\navalanche of data, right?\n- So in genetics, you have genetics\nand then you have genomics\nwhich is the idea of\ngetting the whole genome.\n- All of it.\n- And we don't really have an\nanalogous word for genetics,\nbut it would be connectivity\nand [indistinct].\n- Right.\n[indistinct]\n- Right, so it's wanting it all\nand of course it's crazy ambitious,\nbut that's where it gets fun.\nReally it's a use of electron microscopy,\na very high resolution\nmicroscopic imaging system\non a new scale with way more payoff\nin terms of understanding the connectivity\nof the nervous system\nand it's just emerging,\nbut I really think it's going\nto revolutionize the field\nbecause we're going to be\nable to query these circuits\nhow do they actually do\nit, look at the hardware\nin a way that's never\nbeen possible before.\n- The the way that I\ndescribe this to people\nis if you were to take a\nchunk of kind of cooked\nbut cold spaghetti.\n- Right.\n- And slice it up very thin\nyou're trying to connect up\neach image of each slice of\nthe edge of the spaghetti\nas figure out which ropes of spaghetti\nbelong to which.\n- And have a complete description\nof where this piece of spaghetti\ntouches that piece of spaghetti\nis there's something\nspecial there obviously.\n- Meat sauces and all the other cell types\nand the pesto where it all\nis around the spaghetti\nbecause those are the other\ncells, the blood vessels\nand the glial cells.\nAnd so, what's it good for?\nMaps are great, I always think\nof connectomics and genomics\nand proteomics, et cetera as necessary,\nbut not sufficient.\n- Right.\nRight, so I mean in many cases\nwhat you do is you go out\nand probe the function\nand you understand how the\nbrain does the function\nby finding neurons that seem to be firing\nin association with this\nfunction that you're observing.\nAnd little by little\nyou're work your way in\nand now you want to know\nwhat the conductivity is\nmaybe the anatomy could help you.\nBut this connectomics approach\nor at least the serial electron microscopy\nreconstruction of neurons approach,\nreally is allowing us to frame questions\nstarting from the anatomy and saying,\nI see a synaptic circuit here,\nmy prediction would be that\nthese cell types would interact\nin a particular way, is that right?\nAnd then you can go and\nprobe the physiology\nand you might be right\nor you might be wrong.\nBut more often than not,\nit looks like the structure\nis pointing us in the right direction.\nSo in my case, I'm using this\nto try to understand a circuit\nthat is involved in this\nimage stabilization network\nwe're talking about, keeping\nthings stable on the retina\nand this thing will only respond\nat certain speeds of motion.\nThese cells in the circuit\nlike slow motion they won't\nrespond to fast motion,\nhow does that come about?\nWell, I was able to probe the circuitry,\nI knew what my cells looked like,\nI could see which other\ncells were talking to it,\nI could categorize all the cells\nthat might be the players here\nthat are involved in this\nmechanism of tuning the thing\nfor slow speeds,\nand then we said it looks\nlike it's that cell type\nand we went and looked\nand the data bore that up.\nBut the anatomy drove the search\nfor the particular cell type\nbecause we could see it\nconnected in the right place\nto the right cells.\nSo creates the hypothesis\nthat lets you go query the physiology,\nbut it can go the other way as well.\nSo it's always the synergy\nbetween these functional\nand structural approaches\nit gives you the most lift.\nBut in many cases,\nthe anatomy has been a little\nbit the weak sister in this.\nThe structure trying\nto work out the diagram\nbecause we haven't had the methods.\nNow the methods exist\nand this whole field is\nexpanding very quickly,\nbecause people want these circuit diagrams\nfor the particular part\nof the nervous system\nthat they're working on.\nIf you don't know the cell\ntypes and the connections,\nhow do you really understand\nhow the machine works?\n- Yeah, what I love about is,\nwe don't know what we don't know.\n- Right.\n- And scientists we don't ask\nquestions, we pose hypotheses.\nHypotheses being of course some prediction\nthat you wager your time on basically.\n- Right.\n- And it either turns out\nto be true or not true,\nbut if you don't know\nthat a particular cell type is there,\nyou could never in any\nconfiguration of life or a career\nor exploration of a nervous\nsystem wager a hypothesis\nbecause you didn't know it was there.\nSo this allows you to say ah,\nthere's a little interesting\nlittle connection\nbetween this cell that\nI know is interesting\nin another cell that's a little\nmysterious but interesting,\nI'm going to hypothesize\nthat it's doing blank,\nblank and blank and go test that.\nAnd in the absence of these connectomes,\nyou would never know that\nthat cell was lurking there\nin the shadows.\n- Right, right, yeah.\nAnd if you're just trying to understand\nhow information flows through\nthis biological machine,\nyou want to know where things are.\nNeurotransmitters are\ndumped out of the terminals\nof one cell and they\ndiffuse across the space\nbetween the two cells which\nis kind of a liquidy space\nand they hit some receptors\non the postsynaptic cell\nand they have some impact.\nSometimes that's not\nthrough a regular synapse,\nsometimes it's through a neuromodulator\nlike you often talk about on your podcast\nthat are sort of.\n- Dopamine.\n- Dopamine, exactly.\nOozing into the space between the cells\nand it may be acting at some distance\nfar from where it was released, right?\nBut if you don't know where\nthe release is happening\nand where other things\nare that might respond to that release\nyou're groping around in the dark.\n- Well, I love that you are doing this\nand I have to share\nwith the listeners that,\nthe first time I ever met David\nand every time I've ever\nmet with him in-person\nat least at his laboratory at Brown,\nhe was in his office, door closed,\ndrawing neurons and their connections.\n[laughs]\nAnd this is somewhat unusual\nfor somebody who's a endowed\nfull professor or chairman\nof the department et cetera for many years\nto be doing the hands-on work.\nTypically, that's the stuff\nthat's done by technicians\nor graduate students or postdocs.\nBut I think it's fair to say\nthat you really love\nlooking at nervous systems\nand drawing the accurate renditions\nof how those nervous systems are organized\nand thinking about how they work.\n- Yeah, it's pure joy for me.\nI mean, I'm a very visual\nperson, my wife is an artist,\nwe look a lot of art together\njust the forms of things are\ngorgeous in their own right.\nBut to know that the form\nis in a sense the function\nthat the architecture of the connectivity\nis how the computation happens\nin the brain at some level\neven though we don't fully\nunderstand that in most contexts,\ngives me great joy 'cause\nI'm working on something\nthat's both visually beautiful\nbut also deeply beautiful\nin a sort of a higher\nsort of knowledge context,\nwhat is it all about.\n- I love it, well, as a final question,\nI get asked very often about how people\nshould learn about neuroscience,\nor how they should go about\npursuing maybe an education\nin neuroscience if they're\nat that stage of their life\nor that's appropriate for\ntheir current trajectory.\nDo you have any advice to\nyoung people, old people,\nanything in between about how to learn\nabout the nervous system more\nmaybe in a more formal way?\nI mean obviously, we have our podcast,\nthere are other sources of\nneuroscience information\nout there, but for the young person\nwho thinks they want to\nunderstand the brain,\nthey want to learn about the\nbrain, what should we tell them?\n- Well, that's a great question.\nAnd there's so many sources out there.\nIt's almost a question\nof how do you deal with this\navalanche of information\nout there, I think your podcast\nis a great way for people\nto learn more about the nervous\nsystem in an accessible way.\nBut there's so much stuff out there\nand it's not just that.\nI mean, the resources are\nbecoming more and more available\nfor average folks to participate\nin neuroscience research\non some level.\nThere's this famous Eyewire\nproject of Sebastian.\n- Oh yeah, maybe you let us about Eyewire.\n- Yeah, so that's connectomics\nand that's a situation\nwhere a very clever scientist realized\nthat the physical work of\ndoing all this reconstruction\nof neurons from these\nelectron micro-graphs,\nthere's a lot of time involved.\nMany, many person hours\nhave to go into that\nto come up with the map that you want\nof where the cells are,\nand he was very clever\nabout setting up a context\nin which he could crowdsource this\nand people who were interested\nin getting a little experience\nlooking at nervous tissue\nand participating in a research project\ncould learn how to do\nthis and do a little bit.\n- From their living room.\n- From their living room.\n- We'll put a link to Eyewire,\nit also is a great bridge\nbetween what we were just\ntalking about connectomics\nand actually participating in research.\n- Right.\n- And you don't need a graduate mentor\nor anything like that.\n- Right.\nSo more of this is coming\nand I'm actually interested\nin building more of this\nso that people who are interested,\nwant to participate at some level\ndon't necessarily have\nthe time or resources\nto get involved in laboratory research\ncan get exposed to it and participate\nand actually contribute, so\nI think that's one thing.\nI mean, just asking questions\nof the people around you\nwho know a little bit more\nand have them point you\nin the right direction.\nHere's a book you might like to read,\nthere's lots of great\npopular books out there\nthat are accessible that\nwill give you some more sense\nof the full range of what's\nout there in the neurosciences.\n- We can put some links to\na few of those that we like.\n- Right.\n- On basic neuroscience.\n- Right.\n- Our good friend\nDick Masland, the late Richard,\npeople call him Dick\nMasland had a good book.\nI forget the title at the moment.\nIt's sitting behind me somewhere\nover there on the shelf\nabout vision and how nervous systems work.\nA pretty accessible book\nfor the general public.\n- Right\n- Yeah.\n- Right, so that, and there's\nso many sources out there.\nI mean, Wikipedia is a great way.\nIf you have a particular\nquestion about visual function,\nI would say by all means,\nhead to Wikipedians\nand get the first look\nand follow the the references from there,\nor go to your library,\nor there's so many ways\nto get into it, it's such\nan exciting field now.\nThere's so many,\nI mean, any particular\nrealm that's special to you,\nyour experience, your\nstrengths, your passions,\nthere's a field of\nneuroscience devoted to that.\nIf you know somebody who's\ngot a neurological problem\nor a psychiatric problem,\nthere's a branch of neuroscience\nthat is devoted to\ntrying to understand that\nand to solve these kinds\nof problems down the line.\nSo feel the buzz, it's an\nexciting time to get involved.\n- Great, those are great\nresources that people can access\nfrom anywhere zero-cost as you\nneed an internet connection.\nBut aside from that, we'll\nput the links to some.\nAnd I'm remembering,\nDick's book is called,\n\"We Know It When We See It.\"\n- Right, one of my heroes.\n- Yeah, a wonderful colleague\nwho unfortunately we lost a few years ago.\nBut listen David, this has been wonderful.\n- It's been a blast.\n- We really appreciate you\ntaking the time to do this\nas people probably realize by now\nyou're an incredible wealth of knowledge\nabout the entire nervous system,\ntoday we just hit this top contour\nof a number of different areas\nto give a flavor of the different ways\nthat the nervous system\nworks and is organized\nand how that's put together,\nhow these areas are\ntalking to one another.\nWhat I love about you\nis that you're such an incredible educator\nand I've taught so many\nstudents over the years.\nBut also for me personally as friends,\nbut also any time that I want\nto touch into the the beauty\nof the nervous system, I\nrarely lose touch with it.\nBut anytime I want to touch into it\nand start thinking about new problems\nand ways that the nervous\nsystem is doing things\nthat I hadn't thought about, I call you.\nSo please forgive me for the\ncalls past, present and future\nunless you change your number.\nAnd even if you do, I'll be calling.\n- It's been such a blast Andy.\nThis has been a great session\nand it's always fun talking to you.\nIt always gets my brain\nracing, so thank you.\n- Thank you, thank you\nfor joining me today\nfor my discussion with Dr. David Berson.\nBy now, you should have a\nmuch clearer understanding\nof how the brain is\norganized and how it works\nto do all the incredible\nthings that it does.\nIf you're enjoying
