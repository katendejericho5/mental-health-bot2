    "transcript": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[bright music]\n- I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're going to talk\nabout the Neuroscience of fear.\nWe are also going to talk about trauma\nand post-traumatic stress disorders.\nThe Neuroscience of fear has\na long history in biology\nand in the field of psychology.\nHowever, I think it's fair to\nsay that in the last 10 years,\nthe field of Neuroscience has\nshed light on not just the\nneural circuits, meaning\nthe areas of the brain\nthat control the fear response\nand the ways that it does it,\nbut some important ways\nto extinguish fears\nusing behavioral\ntherapies, drug therapies,\nand what we call brain machine interfaces.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk about all of those,\nand you're going to come away\nwith both an understanding\nof the biology of fear and trauma,\nas well as many practical tools\nto confront fear and trauma.\nIn fact, we are going to discuss\none very recently published study\nin which five minutes a day\nof deliberate exposure to stress\nwas shown to alleviate\nlongstanding depressive\nand fear related symptoms.\nWe will get into the details\nof that study and the protocol\nthat emerges from that study\na little later in the podcast.\nBut it stands as a\nreally important somewhat\ncounter-intuitive example of\nhow stress itself can be used\nto combat fear.\nTo give you a sense of where we are going,\nI'll just lay out the\nframework for today's podcast.\nFirst, I'm going to teach\nyou about the biology of fear\nand trauma.\nLiterally the cells and circuits\nand connections in the body\nand chemicals in the body that\ngive rise to the so-called\nfear response.\nAnd why sometimes, but not\nalways fear can turn into trauma.\nI will also describe the\nbiology of how fear is unlearned\nor what we call extinguished.\nAnd there too, you're going\nto get some serious surprises.\nYou're going to learn for instance,\nthat we can't just eliminate fears.\nWe actually have to replace\nfears with a new positive event.\nAnd again, there are tools\nwith which to do that,\nand I will teach you those tools today.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens every day since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nis that it covers all\nof my vitamin mineral\nand probiotic needs.\nNowadays, there's a lot of data out there\npointing to the fact that\na healthy gut microbiome,\nliterally little microbes\nthat live in our gut\nthat are good for us\nis important to support\nour immune system, our nervous\nsystem, our endocrine system,\nand various aspects of our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nWith Athletic Greens,\nI get all the vitamins\nand minerals that I need.\nPlus the probiotics ensure\na healthy gut microbiome.\nIt also tastes really good.\nI mix mine up with some water,\na little bit of lemon juice.\nI'll have that early in the day,\nand sometimes a second time\nlater in the day as well.\nIt's compatible with intermittent fasting,\nit's compatible with vegan diets,\nwith keto diets and essentially every diet\nthat you could possibly imagine out there.\nIt's also filled with\nadaptogens for recovery.\nIt has digestive enzymes for gut health\nand has a number of\nother things that support\nthe immune system.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nto claim their special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of Vitamin D3 K2.\nThere's now a lot of\nevidence that vitamin D3\nsupports a huge number\nof metabolic factors,\nimmune system factors, endocrine factors.\nBasically we need vitamin D3.\nWe can get it from the sun,\nbut many people are\ndeficient in vitamin D3\neven if they are getting what they think\nis sufficient sunlight.\nAnd K2 is important for\ncardiovascular health.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman.\nYou can claim their special offer,\nthe five free travel packs\nplus the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long-term\nhealth can only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get information\nabout how your specific genes\nare impacting your immediate\nand long-term health.\nNow a problem with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there is\nyou get the numbers back\nbut you don't know what\nto do with those numbers.\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey make it very simple\nto figure out what to do\nto bring those numbers\ninto the ranges that are right for you.\nThey have a dashboard\nthat's very easy to use.\nYou can see the numbers from\nyour blood and or DNA tests.\nAnd it will point to\nspecific lifestyle factors,\nnutritional factors, as\nwell as supplementation,\nmaybe even prescription factors\nthat would be right for you to\nbring the numbers into range\nthat are ideal for your immediate\nand long-term health goals.\nAnother feature that InsideTracker has\nis their inner age test.\nThis test shows you what\nyour biological age is\nand compares that to\nyour chronological age\nand what you can do to\nimprove your biological age,\nwhich of course is the important number.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've been sleeping on a Helix mattress\nfor close to a year now,\nand it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had.\nHelix has a quiz that takes\nabout two minutes to complete\nand matches your body\ntype and sleep preferences\nto the perfect mattress for you.\nSome people sleep on their side,\nsome people sleep on their backs,\nsome people sleep on their stomach.\nSome people run hot, some people run cold.\nSome people don't know\nwhich part of their body\nthey sleep on.\nYou take this test, it's\nvery brief, two minutes.\nAnd after that test Helix we'll match you\nto the mattress that's ideal for you.\nI match to the so-called\nDusk, D-U-S-K mattress,\nbecause I wanted a mattress\nthat wasn't too firm,\nnot too soft.\nAnd I like to sleep sort of on my stomach\nand kind of a crawling soldier position.\nThat seems to be always how I\nwake up in the morning anyway.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minutes sleep quiz\nand they'll match it to\na customized mattress\nand you'll get up to $200\noff all mattress orders\nand you'll get two free pillows.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nplease go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nSo what is fear?\nWell, fear falls into a category\nof nervous system phenomenon\nthat we can reliably call\nan emotion.\nAnd it is hotly debated nowadays.\nAnd it's been hotly debated\nreally for centuries\nwhat an emotion is and\nwhat an emotion isn't.\nNow that's not a debate that\nI want to get into today.\nI think it's fair to say\nthat emotions include\nresponses within our body.\nQuickening of heart rate,\nchanges in blood flow,\nthings that we experience as a warming\nor a cooling of our skin.\nBut that there's also\na cognitive component.\nThere are thoughts, there are memories.\nThere's all sorts of stuff\nthat goes on in our mind\nand in our body that\ntogether we call an emotion.\nAnd there's a vast amount of\ninterest in literature devoted\nto try and understand how many\ndifferent emotions there are,\nhow different people experience emotions.\nAnd that's certainly a\ntopic that we will embrace\nin a future podcast episode.\nBut today I just want to talk\nabout fear as a response.\nBecause when we talk about fear\nas a physiological response\nand as a cognitive response,\nthen we can get down to some\nvery concrete mechanisms\nand some very concrete and practical tools\nthat can be used to deal with\nfear when fear is not wanted.\nSo let's talk first about what fear isn't.\nMost people are familiar with stress,\nboth as a concept and as an experience.\nStress is a physiological response.\nIt involves quickening of the heart rate.\nTypically quickening a breathing,\nblood flow getting\nshuttled to certain areas\nof the brain and body and not to others.\nIt can create a hypervigilance\nor an awareness.\nTypically that awareness is narrower,\nliterally narrower in space,\nlike a soda straw view of the world\nthan when we are relaxed.\nAnd it is fair to say\nthat we cannot have fear\nwithout having several,\nif not all of the elements\nof the stress response.\nHowever, we can have\nstress without having fear.\nLikewise, people are\nfamiliar with the phrase\nor the word rather, anxiety.\nAnxiety tends to be stress\nabout some future event,\nalthough it can mean other things as well.\nWe can't really have fear\nwithout seeing or observing\nor experiencing some of\nthe elements of anxiety,\nbut we can have anxiety\nwithout having fear.\nSo what you're starting to\nrealize is that fear is built up\nfrom certain basic elements\nthat include stress and anxiety.\nAnd then there is trauma.\nAnd trauma also requires a specific,\nwhat we will call operational definition.\nAn operational definition is\njust a definition that allows\nus to have a conversation\nbecause we both agree on\nor mostly agree on what the\nmeaning of a given word is.\nIt makes conversations much easier.\nIn fact, I would argue if we\nall had operational definitions\nfor more things in the world,\nthat there would be fewer\nmisunderstandings and arguments\nand we'd all move a lot\nfurther as a species.\nBut that's another topic entirely.\nThe operational definition of trauma\nis that some fear took place,\nwhich of course includes\nstress and anxiety.\nAnd that fear somehow gets embedded\nor activated in our nervous system,\nsuch that it shows up at\ntimes when it's maladaptive.\nMeaning that fear doesn't serve us well\nand it gets reactivated at various times.\nLike when you first\nwake up in the morning,\nif you're not in the presence\nof something that scared you,\nbut you suddenly have what\nfeels like a panic attack\nand you're in deep fear.\nWell, that's post-traumatic stress.\nThat's post-traumatic fear.\nSo I don't want to get bogged down\ntoo much in the nomenclature\nbut what I'm doing here is building up\na sort of a series of layers\nwhere stress and anxiety\nform the foundation of what\nwe're calling fear and trauma.\nAnd then there are other phrases out there\nthat we would be remiss if\nwe didn't mention things\nlike phobias and panic attacks.\nPanic attacks are the\nexperience of extreme fear\nbut without any fear inducing stimulus.\nSo it's kind of like trauma.\nAnd a phobia tends to be extreme\nfear of something specific.\nFear of spiders, fear of\nheights, fear of flying,\nfear of dying, these\nkinds of things, okay?\nThe reason for laying all that\nout there is not to create\na word soup to confuse us rather\nit is to simplify the issue\nbecause now that we\nacknowledge that there are many\ndifferent phrases to describe\nthis thing that we call fear\nand unrelated phenomenon.\nWe can start to just focus\non two of these issues,\nfear and trauma.\nAs it relates to specific\nbiological processes,\nspecific cognitive processes.\nAnd we can start to dissect\nhow fears are formed,\nhow fears are unformed\nand how new memories\ncan come to replace previously\nfearful experiences.\nSo in this effort to\nestablish a common language\naround fear and trauma,\nI want to point out autonomic arousal.\nAutonomic arousal relates to this aspect\nof our nervous system,\nthat we call the autonomic nervous system.\nAutonomic means automatic\nthat somewhat of a misnomer,\nbecause there are aspects of\nyour autonomic nervous system\nthat you can control.\nBut your autonomic nervous\nsystem controls things like\ndigestion, urination,\nsexual behavior, stress.\nWhen you want to be awake,\nwhen you want to be asleep,\nit basically has two branches to it.\nTwo branches, meaning\ntwo different systems.\nOne is the so-called sympathetic\nautonomic nervous system.\nHas nothing to do with sympathy,\nit has everything to do\nwith increasing alertness.\nThink of the sympathetic nervous system\nas the alertness nervous system.\nIt's what ramps up your\nlevels of alertness,\nramps up your levels of vigilant.\nThink about it as the\naccelerator on your alertness\nand attention.\nThe other branch of the\nautonomic nervous system\nis the so-called,\nparasympathetic branch of\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nI know that's a mouthful.\nThe parasympathetic branch of\nthe autonomic nervous system\nare the cells and neurons and chemicals\nand other aspects of your brain and body\nthat are involved in the\ncalming nervous system.\nSo sympathetic is alerting,\nparasympathetic is calming.\nAnd it acts as sort of a seesaw\nto adjust your overall level of alertness.\nSo for instance, right now I'm alert,\nbut I feel pretty calm.\nI'm not ready to go to\nsleep or anything like that.\nI don't feel like I need a nap.\nI'm alert, but I'm calm.\nI'm not in a state of stress or panic.\nSo that seesaw we could\nimagine is more or less level.\nMaybe it's tilted up a little bit\nto the side of increased\nsympathetic or alertness\nrather than parasympathetic\nbecause I feel wide awake.\nIf I were sleepy, the\nopposite would be true.\nThe parasympathetic side\nwould be increased relative\nto the sympathetic side.\nThere are many different aspects\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nbut one of the main aspects is an aspect\nthat's going to come up again\nand again and again today,\nit's very important that\nyou understand what it is.\nIt's called the HPA axis.\nThe HPA axis stands for\nHypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis.\nThe hypothalamus is a\ncollection of neurons.\nIt's an area of your brain real estate,\nthat's deep in the brain\nat the base of the brain\nthat contains many, many different areas\nthat control things like temperature,\nand desire to have sex,\ndesire to eat, thirst.\nIt also controls the desire\nto not mate, to have sex,\nnot to eat, not drink more water\nor any other type of fluid.\nSo it has accelerators and\nbrakes in there as well.\nThe hypothalamus connects\nto the so-called pituitary,\nthe pituitary lives close\nto the roof of your mouth.\nIt releases hormones\ninto your bloodstream.\nAnd so the hypothalamus\nhas this ability to trigger\nthe release or prevent the\nrelease of particular hormones\nlike cortisol or the hormones\nthat go stimulate ovaries\nto produce estrogen or testes\nto produce testosterone\nor adrenals to produce Adrenaline.\nAnd speaking of the adrenals\nthat [indistinct] and the HPA\nare the adrenals.\nYou have two glands that\nsit above your kidneys\nand your lower back.\nThey receive signals by\nway of nerve cells neurons,\nand by way of hormones and other things\nreleased from the brain\nand elsewhere in the body.\nAnd they release different hormones\nand other types of\nchemicals into the body.\nAnd the two main ones that\nyou need to know about today\nare Adrenaline also called\nEpinephrine and Cortisol.\nBoth of those are\nso-called stress hormones,\nbut they're not always involved in stress.\nThey're also involved in\nwaking up in the morning\nwhen you arrive...\nExcuse me, when you rise from sleep.\nAnd so this HPA axis,\nshould be thought of in the following way.\nThe HPA axis includes\na piece of the brain,\nthe hypothalamus, the\npituitary, and the adrenals.\nSo it's a beautiful three part system\nthat can use your brain to\nalert or wake up your body\nand prepare it for action.\nAnd it can do that in the short term,\nby triggering the release\nof hormones and chemicals\nthat make you alert and\nready to go right away\nand by triggering the\nrelease of neurotransmitters\nand hormones and other chemicals\nthat give that alertness a very long tail,\na very long latency before it shuts off.\nAnd that's important because\none of the hallmarks of fear\nand one of the hallmarks of trauma\nis that they involve fear\nresponses that are long lasting.\nEven if those fearful events,\nthe events in the world\nthat trigger the HPA axis\ncan be very brief, like a\ncar that almost hits you\nas you step off the curb or something...\nA gunshot that goes off suddenly,\nand it's just a very quick,\nlike, you know, 500\nmillisecond or 1 second event.\nThe fear response can\nreverberate through your system\nbecause the chemicals that\nare involved in this HPA axis\nhave a fast component and\na longer-lasting component.\nAnd the longer-lasting\ncomponent can actually change\nnot just the connections of\ndifferent areas of the brain\nand the way that our\norgans work like our heart\nand the way that we breathe.\nIt actually can feed back to the brain\nand literally control gene expression.\nWhich can take many days\nand build out new circuits\nand new chemicals that can embed\nfear in our brain and body.\nAnd that might sound very\ndepressing but there's a reason.\nAnd there's an adaptive\nreason why there's the slow\nand fast phase of the HPA\naxis and the fear response.\nAnd fortunately, that gene expression\nand the long arc of the fear response,\nthe way it kind of lives in our system\nkind of like a phantom in some\nways can also be leveraged\nto undo the fear response,\nto extinguish the fear\nresponse and replace it\nwith non fearful associations.\nSo let's dig a little deeper\ninto the neural circuits\nand biology of fear.\nBecause in doing that,\nwe can start to reveal the\nlogic of how to attack fear\nif that's the goal.\nWe can't have a discussion about fear\nwithout discussing the famous amygdala.\nFamous because I think most people by now\nhave heard of the amygdala.\nAmygdala means almond.\nIt's an almond shaped structure\non both sides of the brain.\nSo you have one on the\nright side of your brain,\nand one on the left side of your brain.\nThe amygdala is part of what\nwe can call the threat reflex.\nAnd this is very important\nto conceptualize fear\nas including a reflex.\nSo much as you have\nreflexes that cause you\nto lift your foot up\nif you are just step on\nsomething sharp.\nYou literally have a reflex\nwithin your spinal cord\nthat causes you to lift up one\nfoot and extend the other one\ntoward the ground.\nBelieve it or not,\nyou always think you\nstep on something sharp\nyou pull your foot up.\nBut you actually step on something sharp,\nyou pull your foot up and in pulling it up\nthere's another reflex that's activated\nthat as you extend your other legs\nso that you don't fall over.\nSimilarly in the process\nof experiencing fear,\nyou have a reflex for particular events\nin your brain and body.\nAnd that reflex involves things like,\nquickening of your heart\nrate, hypervigilance,\nyour attentional systems pop on,\nincreased ability to access\nenergy stores for movement\nand thought and so forth.\nBut just like that step on\nthe tack reflex example,\nall of the neural circuits\nthat are associated\nwith being calm, with\nbeing able to go to sleep,\nwith being able to\nvisualize the full picture\nof your environment,\nliterally to see your entire environment,\nor to hear other things around you.\nAll of those get shut down when\nthe so-called threat reflex\ngets activated.\nAnd the amygdala is part\nof the threat reflect\nso much so that we can really say,\nthat it's the final common pathway\nthrough which the threat reflex flows.\nIn other words,\nthe amygdala is essential\nfor the threat response.\nBut the threat reflex\nand the threat response\nis kind of a dumb response.\nIt's not a sophisticated\nthing, it's very generic.\nAnd this is also a very important point.\nOne of the beauties of the fear system\nis that it's very generalizable.\nIt's not designed for you to\nbe afraid of any one thing.\nSure, there are some debates\nand probably some good data out there\nthat support the fact that\nhuman babies are innately,\nmeaning requires no learning.\nInnately afraid of certain\nthings like heights,\nor snakes or spiders.\nThere's debate about this.\nAnd they depends on the\nquality of the experiment,\net cetera.\nBut the real capacity of the fear system\nis that we can become afraid of anything\nprovided that this threat\nsystem is activated\nin conjunction with some\nexternal experience.\nSo the way I'd like you to\nthink about the amygdala\nis not as a fear center,\nbut that it's a critical\ncomponent of the threat reflex.\nI'd like you to also internalize the idea\nthat the threat reflex involves\nthis activation of certain systems\nand suppression of all the systems\nfor calming the parasympathetic system.\nAnd now I'm going to describe\nthe way that information flows\ninto and through this threat reflex.\nAnd in doing that, it will\nreveal how specific things,\nlike a spider, like a snake,\nlike a physical trauma,\nlike a car accident, like\na fear of public speaking,\nwhatever happens to scare\nyou or scare somebody,\nhow that gets attached to this reflex.\nBecause this reflex is very generic.\nIt doesn't really know\nwhat to be afraid of.\nIt only knows how to\ncreate this sensation,\nthis internal landscape\nthat we think of as fear.\nSo while the amygdala\nmight look like an almond,\nit's actually part of\na much bigger complex\nor collection of neurons\ncalled the amygdaloid complex.\nThat complex has anywhere\nfrom 12 to 14 areas\ndepending on who's...\nWhich neuroanatomist is naming\nthings and carving it up\nin Neuroscience and in much of biology.\nWe like to joke that there are lumpers\nand there are splitters.\nSo some people like to draw boundaries\nbetween every little distinct difference\nand say, \"Oh, that's a separate area\nand other people are lumpers.\"\nAnd they say, \"Well, listen,\nyou know why complicate things?\nLet's lump those together.\"\nI'm neither a lumper nor a splitter,\nI'm somewhere in between.\nI think the number 12 is a good number\nin terms of the number of\ndifferent areas of the amygdala.\nWhy is that important to us?\nWell, it turns out that\nthe amygdala is not just\na area for threat,\nit's an area for generating\nthreat reflexes that integrates\nlots of different types of information.\nSo for those of you that want to know,\nI'm going to give you some\nnames, some nomenclature,\nfor those of you that don't,\nyou can tune out for this.\nBut basically information\nfrom our memory systems,\nlike the hippocampus and\nfrom our sensory systems,\nour eyes, our ears, our\nnose, our mouth, et cetera.\nSo taste information, vision,\nauditory information, touch, et cetera.\nFlow into the so-called lateral\nportion of the amygdala.\nFlows into...\nOr the amygdaloid complex.\nIt flows into the lateral portion.\nAnd then there are multiple\noutputs from the amygdala.\nAnd this is where things\nget particularly interesting\nbecause the outputs of the amygdala\nhave a lot of different areas,\nbut there are two main pathways.\nOne involves the hypothalamus,\nwhich you heard about before\nthis collection of neurons\nthat control a lot of our\nprimitive drives for sex,\nfor food, for thirst and\nfor warmth, et cetera.\nAnd it also feeds out to our adrenals.\nThose glands that you learned\nabout a few minutes ago\nto create a sense of alertness and action.\nIt also feeds out what I mean\nby feeds out, by the way,\nis there are neurons that send wires.\nWe call those wires axons connections.\nWhere they can release chemicals\nand trigger the activation\nof different brain areas.\nSo it feeds out to other\nbrain areas such as the PAG.\nPAG is very interesting\nfor our discussion today.\nIt's the periaqueductal gray.\nThe periaqueductal gray contains neurons\nthat can trigger freezing,\ncan trigger the...\nSome people talk about\nthe fawning response,\nwhich has kind of an appeasing\nresponse to traumatic events.\nBut some people outright freeze\nin response to fear, right?\nWe've heard of fight or flight.\nAnd indeed the pathway that I'm describing\ncan create a sense of fight\nand cause people to want to lean in,\nin an aggressive way to combat\nthings that they're afraid of\nor flight to run away.\nEssentially to avoid\nby mobilizing the thing\nthat they feel they're threatened by.\nNow, even in the absence of some threat,\nsomebody that has say a\nfear of public speaking\nmight hesitate or move away from a podium\nor hesitate or move away\nfrom raising their hand.\nIf raising their hand meant\nthat they might be called on\nand would be public speaking.\nSo there's fight and flight,\nbut there's also the freeze response.\nAnd the freeze response is controlled by\na number of brain centers,\nbut the periaqueductal gray, the PAG,\nis central for this freeze\nresponse and neurons.\nThey're also create what are\ncalled Endogenous opioids.\nMany of you have heard\nof the opioid crisis,\nwhich is a crisis of\nprescription medication\ngiven out too broadly for\npeople that don't need it,\nwho are become addicted to opioids.\nThose are Exogenous opioid.\nBut Endogenous opioids\nare chemicals released\nfrom neurons in the PAG\nand from elsewhere in the body\nthat give us a sense of numbing.\nThey actually numb us against pain.\nAnd you can imagine why biology\nwould be organized this way.\nA threat occurs or something\nthat we perceive as a threat,\nwe're afraid of it.\nAnd a natural analgesic\nis released into our body\nbecause there's likely\nto be an interaction\nthat's very uncomfortable.\nThat's physically uncomfortable.\nSo it's like we have our\nown Endogenous release\nof these opioids and that's\noccurring in the PAG.\nThe other area and again,\nsorry to litter the conversation\nwith these names of structures,\nbut some people seem to enjoy\nknowing these structures.\nYou're fine if you just\nunderstand what the structures do.\nIf you want to know the names that's fine.\nBut the other structure\nis the locus coeruleus.\nThe locus coeruleus\ncreates a sense of arousal,\nby releasing Adrenaline,\nEpinephrine and Norepinephrine,\nor related chemical into the brain.\nSo basically the activation\nof the amygdaloid complex\ncould be from any number\nof different things,\na memory of something fearful.\nAn actual sensory experience\nof something that's fearful.\nAnd but then the fear\nresponse itself is taking part\nbecause of the threat\nreflex gets activated.\nAnd that threat reflex\nthen sends a whole set\nof other functions into action.\nFreezing, activation of the adrenals,\nactivation of locus coeruleus\nfor arousal and alertness,\nactivation of this endogenous pain system\nor anti-pain system in the PAG.\nThat's one pathway out of the amygdala.\nThe other pathway out of the amygdala\nis to a very interesting\narea that typically\nis associated with reward\nand even addiction.\nSo this might come as a\nsurprise to many of you.\nIn fact, it came as a surprise to me.\nI remember when these data were published,\nbut the amygdala complex\nactually projects to areas\nof the Dopamine system.\nThe so-called nucleus accumbens,\nthe mesolimbic reward pathway,\nfor those of you that want to look that up\nor that remember from\nthe Dopamine episodes.\nWe have pathways in our\nbrain that are associated\nwith pursuit, motivation and reward.\nAnd the neuromodulator\nDopamine is largely responsible\nfor that feeling of\ncraving, pursuit and reward.\nAnd this threat center is\nactually able to communicate with\nand activate the Dopamine system.\nAnd later you will realize\nwhy that is very important\nand why you can leverage\nthe Dopamine system\nin order to wire in new memories\nto replace fearful ones.\nSo I've been hitting you with\na lot of names of things,\nbut for the moment,\neven if you're interested in\nall the Neuroscience names\nand structures and so forth.\nI'd like you to just conceptualize\nthat you have a circuit in your brain,\nmeaning a set of cells and connections\nthat are arranged in the following way.\nYou have a threat reflex that\ncan be activated at any time\nvery easily, but what\nactivates that threat reflex\ncan depend on two things.\nOne are prior memories\ncoming from brain areas\nthat are involved in storage of memories,\nor it can be immediate experiences.\nThings are happening in the now, okay?\nSo were something fearful\nto happen right now,\nyour threat reflux could be activated.\nWhere you to remember something very scary\nthat happened to you in the past?\nYour threat reflex could be activated.\nAnd that threat reflex\ncircuit has two major outputs.\nOne of the major outputs is\nto areas that are involved in\nthe threat response, freezing\npain management and alertness.\nAnd the other major output\nis to areas involved\nin reward, motivation\nand reinforcement, okay?\nThere's a fourth component.\nAnd I promise this is the last component\nthat we need to put into this picture\nof the neural circuits for fear.\nAnd this is a circuit that\ninvolves an area of the brain\ncalled the prefrontal cortex\nand some of its subdivision.\nSo literally in the front.\nAnd it's involved in what\nwe call top-down processing.\nTop-down processing is the way\nthat your prefrontal cortex\nand other areas of the brain\ncan control or suppress\na reflex, okay?\nA good example of this would\nbe the step on the tack example\nthat I gave before.\nSo when you step on a tack,\nyou immediately pull up your foot\nand you extend the other leg.\nThat's the reflex that prevents\nyou from injuring yourself\nand from falling over.\nHowever, if you wanted,\nnot that you would want to.\nBut if you wanted, you could for instance,\nplace your foot onto a tack\nand decide not to pull your foot away.\nIt would be difficult.\nAnd again, I don't\nrecommend that you do that,\nbut you could override that reflex, okay?\nThere are other examples of reflexes,\nlike for instance,\ngetting into cold water,\nmost people will start\nto huddle their body.\nMost people won't want to\nget into the cold water.\nMany people will jump out.\nBut all of that is reflexive.\nAnd should you want to, you\ncould override that reflex\nthrough top-down processing.\nYou could tell yourself,\n\"Oh, I heard on a previous\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nor on an Instagram post\nthat cold water exposure\ncan be beneficial for metabolism\nand resilience, et cetera.\"\nAnd indeed it can, and you can\ndecide to get into the water\nand to stretch out your\nbody, not to huddle,\nand you can fight those reflexes, okay?\nThe fighting of reflex\nis carried out through\ntop-down processing, largely\nthrough the prefrontal cortex.\nYou provide a narrative.\nYou tell yourself, \"I want to\ndo this or I should do this.\nOr even though I don't want\nto, I'm going to do it anyway.\"\nSo top-down processing\nis not just for getting into cold water,\nand it certainly isn't\nfor overriding reflexes\nthat can damage us like a\nstepping on the tack example.\nIt is the way in which we can override\nany number of internal reflexes,\nincluding the threat reflex.\nAnd the way that we do that\nis by giving a new story\nor a new narrative to this\nexperience that we call threat.\nAnd you know the threat response,\nthe threat response is\nquickening of the heart rate,\nquickening of the breathing.\nWe don't generally like the feeling\nof Adrenaline in our system.\nSome people are so-called\nAdrenaline junkies,\nand they get a mixture of\nDopamine and Adrenaline\nfrom certain high intensity events.\nI confess in previous aspects of my life,\nI've tended to like Adrenaline.\nI don't think I was at the\nextreme of thrill seeking,\nbut I'm somebody that for\ninstance, I tend to like...\nI like roller coasters,\nI've done various things\nwhere I'm familiar with\nand I enjoy the sensation\nof Adrenaline in my body.\nBut I enjoy it because of\nthe alertness that it brings\nand the hyperacuity that it brings,\nmany people don't feel that way.\nIn fact, most people\ndon't like the sensation\nof a lot of Adrenaline in their system.\nThat it makes them feel very uncomfortable\nand out of control.\nWe will do an entire\nepisode about Adrenaline\nand Adrenaline junkies\nand Adrenaline aversives\nin the future.\nBut the threat reflex inevitably involves\nthe release of Adrenaline into the system.\nAnd then it becomes a\nquestion of whether or not\nyou remain still, move forward or retreat\nfrom that Adrenaline experience.\nAnd when I say the Adrenaline experience,\nI mean the threat reflex.\nSo this fourth component of\nfear is really our ability\nto attach narrative, to attach a meaning\nand to attach purpose to\nwhat is by all accounts\nand purposes, a generic response.\nThere's no negotiating\nwhat fear feels like.\nThere's only negotiating what it means.\nThere's only negotiating\nwhether or not you persist,\nwhether or not you pause or\nwhether or not you retreat.\nSo this is usually the\npoint in the podcast\nwhere I think people start asking,\n\"Okay, well, there's the biology,\nthere's the mechanism, there's the logic.\nHow do I eliminate fear?\"\nWell, it's not quite that simple.\nAlthough by understanding\nthe logic and the mechanisms\nby which these circuits are built,\nwe can eventually get to that place.\nI do want to plant a flag\naround a particular type of tool\nor a logical framework around a particular\nset of tools rather,\nthat we are going to build\nout through this episode.\nAnd based on what you now\nknow that the threat reflex\ngets input and it has outputs\nand it's subject to these\ntop-down processing events,\nthese narratives.\nYou should be asking yourself,\nwhat sort of narratives should\nI apply to eliminate fear?\nWell, first let's take a step back\nand just acknowledged the reality,\nwhich is that fear is in some\ncases, an adaptive response.\nWe don't want people eliminating fears\nthat can get them\ninjured or killed, right?\nThe reason that the fear threat response\nand reflex exists at all\nis to help us from dying,\nto help us from making\nreally bad decisions.\nIt just so happens that a\nnumber of things happened to us\nthat are not lethal, that don't harm us,\nbut that harm us from the inside.\nAnd I think that and here\nI'm borrowing language\nfrom an excellent researcher\nwho's done important work\nin this area at Harvard.\nHis name is Dr. Kerry Ressler.\nHe's both a medical doctor\nand a PhD, so an MD-PhD.\nHe's the chief scientific\nofficer at McLean Hospital.\nHe's a professor of psychiatry\nat Harvard Medical School,\nand he's done extensive\nand important work on fear.\nI'm going to refer back\nto Dr. Ressler's work\nseveral times during this podcast,\nincluding important and\nsuper interesting work\non transgenerational passage of trauma.\nHe's a absolutely world-class biologist,\nabsolutely world-class clinician.\nAnd Dr. Ressler has described\nfear before as containing\na historical component.\nSo it's not just about a\nreadiness for things that might\ninjure us or kill us in\nthe immediate circumstance\nbut also protecting us for the future\nbecause of our important need\nand ability to anticipate.\nAnd what he describes our\nmemories as protective\nor memories as dangerous.\nYou know, some memories,\neven if they evoke a sense\nof fear in us are protective.\nThey protect us from making bad mistakes\nthat could get us injured or killed,\nor put us into really\nhorrible circumstances.\nOther memories are dangerous\nbecause they create a\nsense in us of discomfort,\nand they tend to limit our behavior\nin ways that are maladaptive.\nThat prevent us from having\nhealthy relationships to others,\nhealthy job relationships,\nhealthy relationship\nto ourselves, frankly.\nSo this language of memories as protective\nor memories as dangerous\nin the context of fear\nis not something that I said,\nit's really something that\nI lifted from Dr. Ressler\nin one of his many impressive lectures.\nAnd it's an important aspect of fear\nbecause much of the fear\nsystem is a memory system.\nIs designed to embed a memory\nof certain previous experiences in us.\nSuch that the threat reflex is activated\nin anticipation of what\nmight happen, okay?\nSo let's talk for a second\nabout how certain memories\nget attached to this fear system.\nAnd this brings us to a beautiful\nand indeed Nobel Prize winning aspect\nof biology and physiology,\nwhich is Pavlovian conditioning.\nMany of you are probably\nfamiliar with Pavlov's dogs\nand the famous Pavlovian\nconditioning experiments.\nThey go something like this.\nAnd Pavlov did these\nexperiments and ring a bell,\na dog doesn't do much\nin response to a bell.\nIt might attend to it\nbut it doesn't salivate typically\nin response to the bell.\nHowever, if you pair the ringing of a bell\nwith a presentation of food enough times,\nthe dog will salivate\nin response to the food.\nEventually you take away the food,\nyou just rang the bell\nand the dog will salivate\nin response to the bell, okay?\nSo in the context of so-called\nPavlovian conditioning,\nthese things have names\nlike conditioned stimulus,\nand unconditional stimulus and responses.\nPeople often get these mixed up\nand it can be a little confusing,\nbut I'm just going to make\nit really simple for you.\nThe unconditioned stimulus\nis the thing that evokes\na response unconditionally.\nSo food is the unconditioned stimulus\nin the example I just gave.\nA foot shock or a loud bang\nwould be the unconditioned\nstimulus in a...\nFor instance say,\nan experiment geared\ntoward exploring fear.\nThat unconditioned\nstimulus is unconditional.\nIt unconditionally evokes a startle\nor in the case of food salivating.\nThe bell in the previous\nexample is what we call\nthe conditioned stimulus or\nthe conditioning stimulus.\nSometimes people mix these up.\nThe condition stimulus is\npaired with the thing that\nnaturally creates a response.\nAnd then eventually the condition stimulus\ncreates the response itself.\nYou might think, well,\nthat just seems endlessly\nboring and simple, but\nthis is actually the way\nthat our fear systems work.\nExcept unlike Pavlov's\ndogs, you don't need many,\nmany pairings of a bell with\nsome unconditioned stimulus\nin order to get a response.\nYou can get what's called\none trial learning.\nAnd in this circuit that\ninvolves the amygdala,\nthe threat reflex,\nand all this other stuff that\nI was talking about earlier,\nthe system is set up for learning.\nIt's set up to create memories\nand to anticipate problems.\nIt's a very good system\nbecause it was designed to keep us safe.\nAnd so the way to think about\nthis is that for many people,\none intense experience,\none burn, one bad breakup,\none bad experience, public speaking.\nOne bad experience with somebody pet snake\nor whatever it happens to\nbe can cause intense fear\nin the moment, a long\n[indistinct] experience of fear,\nlike trouble sleeping that\nnight and the following night.\nMemories of the experience\nthat are troubling,\nphysiological responses\nthat are troubling.\nEssentially it gets wired\nin as a fear with one trial.\nWhich is quite different\nthan the other forms\nof neuroplasticity.\nNeuroplasticity, of course,\njust being the nervous\nsystem's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nOther forms of neuroplasticity\nlike learning a language, learning music,\nlearning math, those take a while.\nWe don't generally get one trial learning\nto positive or neutral experiences.\nWe get one trial learning\nto negative experiences.\nSo there's this asymmetry\nin how we're wired.\nSo now you should understand\nhow classical conditioning\nas it's called occurs.\nYou go to give a piano recital as a kid,\nyou sit down and you freeze up\nand it's horribly embarrassing.\nAnd even if you just freeze\nup for a few seconds,\nthe heart rate increase\nand the perspiring,\nthe sweating and the shame that you feel\nleads you to want to\navoid playing instruments\nor public displays of performances\nfor a long period of time\nunless you do something to overcome it.\nThat's one trial learning.\nSome people,\nit tends to be more an\naccumulation of experiences.\nThey have a bad relationship\nthat lasts an entire summer,\nan entire year, or God forbid a decade.\nAnd then they have what they feel\nis of a general sense of fear\nabout closeness to others,\nan attachment.\nThese are common fears\nthat people experience.\nFears can be in the short-term,\nfears can be in the long-term,\nthey can be in the medium term.\nAgain, the fear system is very generic.\nIt's wired to include\nmemories that are very acute,\nthat happened within a\nmoment, or that include many,\nmany events in long periods of time.\nThat kind of funnel into a general sense\nof relationships are bad\nor this particular city\nor location is bad.\nSo there's a key what we\ncall temporal component.\nThere's a component of the fear system\nbeing able to batch many events in time\nand create one specific fear\nor take one very specific\nisolated incident\nthat happened very briefly\nand create one very large\ngeneral sense of fears.\nAnd I'll give an example of the latter,\njust to kind of flesh\nthis out a little bit.\nI had a friend come\nvisit me in San Francisco\nsome years ago, and their\ncar got broken into.\nUnfortunately, a frequent\noccurrence in San Francisco\neven in the middle of the day.\nNever leave anything\nyour car in San Francisco\nthey'll break in, in the middle\nof the day, doesn't matter.\nPolice can be having coffee right there\nin front of them they'll still do it,\nfor reasons we could\ndiscuss, this is a problem.\nThey got their belongings\ntaken and they decided\nthey were never coming\nback to San Francisco.\nThis was an isolated\nincident that forever colored\ntheir view of the city.\nWhich I frankly,\nunderstanding the fear system,\nI can understand.\nWe can have isolated\nincidents that wick out\nto broad decisions about entire places,\nor we can have many experiences\nthat funnel into very\nspecific isolated fears about\nparticular circumstances,\nplaces and things.\nSo I like to think that by\nnow you have a pretty good\nunderstanding of the\ncircuits that underlie\nthe threat reflex, the fear response,\nand how we have top-down control,\nmeaning we can attach a\nnarrative to the fear response.\nAnd that the fear response can be learned\nin association with\nparticular events, okay?\nI haven't really talked about\nhow the learning occurs.\nAnd so I just want to take\na moment and describe that\nbecause it leads right into our discussion\nabout how to eliminate fears,\nand indeed how to replace fears\nwith more positive experiences.\nThere's a process in our nervous system\nthat we call neuroplasticity.\nNeuroplasticity broadly defined\nis the nervous system's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nBut at a cellular level,\nthat occurs through a couple\nof different mechanisms.\nOne of the main mechanisms\nis something called\nlong-term potentiation.\nLong-term potentiation\ninvolves the strengthening\nof particular connections between neurons.\nThe connection sites between\nneurons we call synapses,\nactually technically synapses are the gaps\nbetween those connections.\nBut nonetheless, synapses are\nthe point of communication\nbetween neurons and\nthose can be strengthened\nso that certain neurons\ncan talk to other neurons\nmore robustly than they\nhappened to before.\nAnd anytime we talk\nabout a particular event,\nthe car, the snake, the\npublic speaking, the trauma,\nthe horrible experience,\nwiring into the fear system.\nWhat we're talking about is a\nchange in synaptic strengths.\nWe're talking about\nneurons that previously\ndid not communicate well,\ncommunicating very well.\nIt's like going from a old\nschool dial up connection,\nor even an old school telephone connection\nor Morse code connection of communication\nto high speed ethernet, okay?\nTo a 5G connection.\nIt gets faster, it gets more robust,\nand it's very, very clear.\nThat's what happens when you\nget long-term potentiation.\nAnd long-term potentiation involves\na couple of cellular mechanisms\nthat are going to be\nrelevant to our discussion\nabout treatments to undue fear.\nAnd I'll just throw out\na couple of the names\nof some of those cellular\nelements right now.\nThe main one is the\nso-called N-M-D-A receptor,\nN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.\nAnd what this is, is this\nis a little docking site,\nlike a little parking slot on a neuron.\nAnd when a neuron gets\nactivated very strongly\nlike from an intense event\nin the example of my friend,\nthe intense event.\nAlmost certainly activated\nand NMDA receptors\nrelated to their concept of\nprotecting their property\nin their cars, the break into their car\ncaused the NMDA receptor to be activated.\nNormally that NMDA receptor\nis not easily activated\nwhen it is activated\nit sets off a cascade,\na series of signals within those neurons\nthat change those neurons.\nIt changes the genes they express,\nit shuttles more parking spots\nto the surface of those cells\nso that the communication to\nthose cells becomes easier,\nit becomes faster.\nAnd so the way to think\nabout the NMDA receptor\nis it's used sometimes for normal things\nthat we do every day,\nmaking cups of coffee\nand things like that.\nBut it's often used for learning.\nIt's used for creating a new associations\nin our nervous system.\nAnd so the activation of\nthe NMDA receptor and LTP,\nand it involves some other things\nthat you may have heard of like,\nbrain-derived neurotrophic\nfactor and calcium entry,\nthings that we can leave for a\ndiscussion for a future time.\nBut basically a whole cascade\nof events happen within cells\nthat then make just even the\nmere thought of something\nor somebody or some event that happened\nable to activate that threat reflex, okay?\nSo long-term potentiation is\none of the main mechanisms\nby which we take formerly\ninnocuous or irrelevant events,\nand we make them scary.\nWe make them traumatic.\nOur neurons have mechanisms to do this.\nNow, fortunately, the NMDA receptor\nand long-term potentiation\ncan also run the whole system in reverse.\nYou can get what's called\na long-term depression,\nand that doesn't have anything\nto do with the depression\nassociated with low mood.\nWhat we're talking about is\na weakening of connections.\nYou can go from having a very\nhigh speed ethernet connection\nbetween neurons, so to speak,\nto a connection that's\nmore like Morse code,\nor as like a poor dial up\nconnection or really weak signal.\nAnd that's what's happening\nwhen you extinguish a fear,\nwhen you unlearn a fear.\nSo now I'd like to talk about\ntherapies that are carried out\nin humans that allow fears to be undone,\nthat allow traumas to be reversed,\nsuch that people no longer feel bad about\na particular person, place or thing.\nEither real interactions with\nthat person, place or thing,\nor imagine interactions with\nthat person, place or thing.\nThat process as I just mentioned\nalso involves things\nlike the NMDA receptor\nbut rather than\nstrengthening the connections\nthe first thing that has\nto happen is there needs\nto be a weakening of\nconnections that associate\nthe person, place or thing\nwith that threat reflex.\nSubsequent to that,\nwe will see there needs\nto be a strengthening\nof some new experience\nthat's positive, okay?\nThis is a key element\nof where we are headed\ncontrary to popular belief,\nit is not going to work to\nsimply extinguish a fear.\nOne needs to extinguish\na fear and or trauma\nand replace that fearful\nor traumatic memory\nor idea or response with\na positive response.\nAnd this is something\nthat's rarely discussed\nboth in the scientific literature,\nbut certainly in the general discussion\naround fear and trauma.\nThere's this idea that\nwe can extinguish fears,\nwe can rewire ourselves, we\ncan eliminate our traumas\nand indeed we can.\nBut that process has to\ninvolve not just becoming\ncomfortable with a particular\nfearful event or trauma,\nbut also attaching a\nnew positive experience\nto that previously fearful\nor traumatic event.\nThere are a lot of different\napproaches out there\nthat are in clinical\nuse to try and alleviate\nfear and trauma and indeed PTSD,\npost-traumatic stress disorder.\nIt might be surprising to learn\nthat many of those\ntreatments such as SSRIs,\nthe selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor.\nThings like Prozac and Zoloft and similar\nand other antidepressants.\nOr things like Benzodiazepines,\nwhich are essentially like painkillers.\nThey create elevation in certain\ntransmitters in the brain\nlike GABA among others.\nThey can have a pain relieving effect.\nThey are generally however,\nconsidered anxiolytics,\nthey reduce anxiety and\neven antipsychotic drugs\nor Beta blockers sometimes\ncalled adrenergic blockers.\nDrugs that are designed\nto prevent the heart\nfrom beating too fast or\nto reduce blood pressure,\nto reduce some elements\nof the hypothalamic-pituitary\naxis response\nthat we talked about earlier.\nMany people experienced\nsome degree of relief\nfrom the symptoms of\nanxiety and fear and PTSD\nin taking these various compounds.\nIndeed, that's why they're\nprescribed so broadly.\nBut you may find it interesting to note\nthat none of those current treatments\nare based on the neurobiology of fear,\nat least not directly, right?\nPeople that take SSRIs\noftentimes will experience\na reduction in anxiety.\nIt depends on the dosage\nand the individual of course, right?\nAnd you have to work with\na doctor, a psychiatrist,\nto determine whether or\nnot they're right for you\nin the correct dosage, if\nthey are right for you.\nBut that modulation of\nanxiety can indirectly\nreduce the likelihood that\none will have a panic attack\nor experience of fear, an\nintense experience of fear\nor reliving of a trauma.\nBut the SSRIs themselves are not plugging\ninto some specific mechanism\nrelated to how fear\ncomes about in the system.\nIt's an indirect support.\nThat's important because if\nthe goal of modern psychiatry\nand the goal of modern\nbiology is to provide\nmechanistic understanding\nthat leads to treatments.\nWe need to think about what\nare the sorts of treatments\nthat tap into the very fear circuits\nthat we described before.\nThe fact that there are memories attached\nto a generic threat reflex and response.\nAnd the threat reflex and\nresponse can be linked up\nwith the Dopamine system\nand can be linked up with other systems\nthat are involved in pain,\nrelief and anxiety and so forth.\nAnd so that brings us to which treatments\nare directly related to the fear circuitry\nand the circuitry related to trauma?\nAnd the primary one to\nbegin with is the so-called\nbehavioral therapies.\nNow, oftentimes we all wish\nI think from time to time\nthat there's some specific\npill that we can take\nor there's some machine or device\nthat we can plug our finger into\nor that we can put on a headset\nand all of a sudden we just\nrewire our nervous system.\nFear has gone, trauma's gone,\nbut it doesn't work that way.\nAnd when we think of language\nand narrative as a tool\nto rewire our nervous system\nin comparison to those\nkinds of ideas about pills\nand machines and potions,\nit starts to seem a\nlittle bit weak, right?\nIf we just think, \"Oh,\nwell, how could talking\nactually change the way that\nwe respond to something?\"\nBut actually there are\nthree forms of therapy\nthat purely through the use of language\nhave been shown to have\nvery strong positive impact,\nmeaning reduce fears and traumas.\nAnd those three are\nprolonged exposure therapy,\ncognitive processing, or CPT\nand cognitive behavioral therapy.\nAnd I not going to go\ninto the entire literature\naround prolonged exposure,\ncognitive processing,\nand cognitive behavioral therapy.\nBut I will just illustrate\nthe central theme\nthat allows them to work.\nNow, remember that the circuit for fear,\nthe circuit for trauma\ninvolves this generic reflex.\nAnd then there are those top-down elements\ncoming from the forebrain.\nIt's very clear because it's been measured\nthat if you look at the amount of anxiety,\nthe pure physiological anxiety response\nof quickening of heart\nrate, flushing of the skin,\nsometimes quaking of the hands,\nthat the experience of fear over time\nwhen people recount or retell their trauma\nthat the first time they do that\nespecially when it's\nrecounted in a lot of detail\nthere's a tremendous anxiety response.\nSometimes even as great or\ngreater than the actual exposure\nto the fearful event or trauma.\nAnd obviously this is\nsomething that is done\nwith a clinician present,\nbecause it is very\ntraumatic to the person.\nThey're literally reliving the\ntrauma in full rich detail,\nand they are encouraged to\nprovide full rich detail.\nThey're often encouraged to\nspeak in complete sentences\nto flush out details about\nhow they felt in inside,\nto flush out details about their memories\ngoing into this traumatic\nor fearful event,\ngoing through it.\nAnd after really digging\ninto all the nuance\nand contours of these\nhorrible experiences.\nBut what's remarkable is that\nin the second and the third\nand the fourth retelling\nof these traumatic\nor fearful events that anxiety response\nand the amount of the\nphysiological response,\nI should say that the\namplitude of the physiological\nbecomes progressively\ndiminished with each retelling.\nNow, some of you might be saying,\n\"Well, duh, you know, you\ntell a story enough times,\nthat eventually it wears off.\"\nJust like if you watch\na movie enough times\nand you hear the same joke enough times\neventually it doesn't\nhave the same impact.\nBut that [indistinct] be the case, right?\nYou could imagine that this\nhigh amplitude anxiety response,\nthis high amplitude activation\nof the sympathetic nervous\nsystem in retelling\nwould actually create a even\ndeeper routed fear response\nand trauma but that's not what happens.\nAnd every clinician I\nspoke to in anticipation\nof this episode which include\nclinical psychologists,\npsychiatrists and people who actually\nwork on the fear system\nat a biological level\nsaid the exact same thing which is that,\n\"A detailed recounting of the traumatic\nand fearful events is absolutely essential\nin order to get the positive\neffects of prolonged exposure,\ncognitive processing and\ncognitive behavioral therapy.\"\nAgain, this has to be done\nwith the appropriate support.\nThis isn't something that\nshould be taken lightly\nbecause as we've mentioned before\nthe fear response can\nhave a very long lasting\ncontour to it.\nPeople can sometimes have trouble sleeping\nfor days and days.\nAnd afterwards we'll talk\nabout sleep in a little bit.\nBut the point is that the\nretelling is important.\nAnd the idea here is to\ntake what was a terrible\nand extremely troubling,\nmeaning physiologically troubling,\npsychologically troubling story,\nand turn it into what\nis essentially a boring,\nbad story, okay?\nIt never really becomes a\ngood story at this point\nin the treatment process\nthat we're describing.\nSo a terrible event is\na terrible event period.\nBut there's a way in which\nthe retelling of that event\nstarts to uncouple the threat\nreflex from the narrative.\nAnd with each successive\nretelling in detail\nof these traumatic events,\nof these fearful events,\nthe threat reflex is\nactivated at a progressively\nlower and lower amplitude.\nSuch that eventually it\njust becomes a really bad,\nreally boring story.\nNow that's one part of the\nprocess of getting over a fear.\nIt's what we call fear extinction.\nAnd we can bring ourselves\nback to our earlier example\nof Pavlovian conditioning,\nbecause many studies have been done\nboth in animals and in\nhumans showing that,\nfor instance, if you pair\na tone, a bell or a buzzer\nwith a foot shock that\nan animal or a person\nwill brace themselves for the foot shock.\nEventually you can just\ngive the bell or a tone\nand the person will experience\nthat same freezing up\nor the same fight or\nflight or freeze response.\nSo you conditioned that.\nBut if you give the tone\nor the bell over and over,\nand there's no foot\nshock, there's no pain,\nand in human [indistinct]\nsometimes I'm with foot shocks,\nsometimes believe it\nor not with mild burn,\neven some studies, there is older studies\nyou couldn't do those now,\nnor would you want to.\nBut eventually what happens is the tone...\nThe bell no longer evokes\nthat response, okay?\nSo you see this as a reversal\nof the classical conditioning\nand we call that reversal extinction.\nSo the retelling of this traumatic\nor fearful narrative, excuse me,\nfearful narrative is essentially\nan extinction process.\nNow, how is this done?\nOne can do this in a\ntherapist office face-to-face,\nthat's sometimes done.\nIt's sometimes done in group type settings\nwhere people actually stand up\nor sit in front of a group small or large\nand recount in detail\ntheir traumatic experience.\nIt's sometimes done by people writing out\nthe experience in detail.\nAnd which one of these\nis the most effective?\nIsn't really clear.\nThe literature points to the\nfact that a feeling of trust\nobviously between the\npatient and the clinician\nor the person and the group is essential.\nSome people don't have\naccess to because of finances\nor other limitations to\ntherapy of that sort.\nIn that case, journaling in detail\nhas been shown to be effective.\nAlthough, again, I want to caution people\nabout reactivating traumas\nwithout consideration\nfor the kinds of social\nsupport they might need\naround that reactivation.\nAnd we will talk a little bit later about\nsome of the chemicals\ninvolved in social support\nand why those help extinguish fears.\nSo the thing to embed in\nyour mind is that recognition\nof the early traumatic or\nfearful event in detail\nover and over is key to forming\na new non-traumatic association\nwith that event or person.\nSo that's part one, you need\nto diminish the old experience.\nAnd when I say diminish,\nI mean, reduce the amplitude\nof the physiological response.\nNow this is just but one approach.\nI'm going to talk about other approaches\nto eliminating fear and\ntrauma as we go forward.\nBut I want to emphasize that\ndiminishing the amplitude\nof the physiological\nresponse is the first step.\nSo it's like a clearing\naway of the association\nbetween the person, place or\nthing and that threat reflex.\nBut even after that's occurred,\nthere's an essential need\nto relearn a new narrative.\nWhy is their essential need\nto relearn a new narrative\nor create a new association?\nWell, that has to do with\nthat fear reflect circuitry.\nAs you recall, there outputs\ntwo areas of the brain\nthat are associated with Dopamine\nrelease and reinforcement.\nAnd that we now know offers the capacity\nfor these fear circuits\nin these circuits that underlie trauma\nto be mapped onto new experiences\nthat are of positive association.\nSo I'm going to give a\nkind of basic example.\nIt's a kind of a silly example,\nbut I'm giving it as a\ntemplate for what could be\nany number of other different examples.\nExample I'll give is\nlet's say a kid is biking\nto play soccer, soccer practice,\nand they get into a\nbad car accident, okay?\nTerrible thing to\nhappen, but they survive.\nThey recover.\nAnd somehow...\nAnd we really don't know\nwhy certain fear memories\nget wired in more\nbroadly or more narrowly.\nSomehow this kid just doesn't\neven want to bicycle anymore.\nAnd they actually don't\neven want to play sports.\nAnd they actually just\ndon't want to go anywhere.\nThey're kind of isolating and\nnot interacting with friends\nvery much at all.\nIt's a pretty broad response.\nIt didn't have to be that way.\nSome kids would just decide they\ndon't want to cycle any more\ndown that particular street.\nWell, the process of\nretelling the narrative\nto a clinician would allow an extinction\nof the fear response, right?\nSo a reduction in the heart rate,\na reduction in the narrowing of focus,\na reduction in all the\nthings that we consider fear.\nBut a really good cognitive\nbehavioral therapist\nor somebody that understands\nthe Neuroscience of fear\nand trauma would understand\nthat that's not sufficient.\nThat's what it's really\nimportant is that this child,\nthis hypothetical child\nrelearn a new narrative\nthat they don't just manage\nto bike to soccer practice\nor manage to spend time with friends,\nbut that they actually start\nwiring in new positive associations\nwith biking to practice,\nwith playing soccer,\nwith social events.\nAnd, and this is the somewhat\nsurprising feature of this\nand that they link that back\nto that early traumatic experience.\nThat it's not just that they're replacing\nthat bad experience and memory\nwith a good experience and memory,\nbut they're actually holding in mind\nin these top-down narrative\ncircuits, if you will.\nThey're holding in mind,\n\"Ah, I'm not just biking\nto soccer practice.\nI'm actually biking to soccer\npractice and I'm enjoying it\ndespite the fact that I\nwas in a bad car accident.\nDespite the fact that two\nmonths ago or two years ago,\nor maybe even 10 years ago,\nI couldn't even leave my room\nor I didn't want to\nassociate with anybody.\"\nSo the building up of the\npositive associations are key.\nAnd the linking of those\npositive associations with the\nearlier traumatic event is\nkey for the following reason,\nthe top-down circuitry\nfrom the prefrontal cortex\nto this threat reflex circuit\nis not like the other\nconnections in that circuit.\nThe other connections in that circuit\nare what we call\nglutamatergic and excitatory.\nThey are all about\nactivating other neurons,\nlike a chain reaction.\nOne neuron activates, the next activates,\nthe next like dominoes falling.\nThese top-down circuits that\nfeed into the threat reflex\nand all its parts is\nwhat we call inhibitory.\nIt tends to prevent activation\nof those given circuitries.\nIt tends to prevent activation\nof the threat reflex.\nSo it's acting as a break.\nAnd so when we think\nof positive experiences\nbeing associated with what was previously\na negative experience,\nwe're not talking about\nforgetting that the car\naccident was horrible\nor forgetting that the assault\nwas absolutely dreadful.\nWe're talking about attaching\na new positive memory\nto the circuitry so that\nthe previous fear response\nis far less likely to occur\nand that it remains extinguished.\nSo just to make sure\nthis is absolutely clear,\nthere's a first step which\ninvolves retelling and reliving\nin order to extinguish\nthe fear and the trauma,\nto reduce the amplitude of the response.\nThen there's a need to replace or attach\npositive experiences to the earlier\nwhat would be traumatic response.\nThe extinction has to\ngo first, this is key.\nYou can't simply say, \"Oh, you know,\nthe car accident was actually a good thing\nbecause I stayed home a lot\nthat year and I got to study.\"\nYou can tell yourself that\nand that could also be true.\nBut that won't necessarily\nand probably won't\neliminate the fear or\nthe traumatic association\nof the car accident.\nAnd again, I'm using car\naccidents as a general example\nor a generic example here, okay?\nSo there's a three-part process.\nOne diminished the old experience through\nrepetitive narrative.\nAnd almost inevitably\nthe initial repetition\nof that is going to be very high amplitude\nand quite troubling.\nBut over time it will reduce, right?\nYou're turning that terrible\nreally upsetting story\ninto a terrible boring story.\nThat's the extinction process.\nThen there's a relearning\nof a new narrative\nthat includes some sort\nof sense of reward.\nAnd that sense of reward\nhas to be tacked back\non to the traumatic event\nor what was previously a traumatic event.\nAnd that is all through narrative.\nIt's all through cognition.\nAnd I think this is a\nvery important point.\nOftentimes I think we tend to undervalue\nthe importance of rationalization\nand of story and of narrative.\nBut the prefrontal cortex\nis this amazing capacity\nof our brain real estate\nto create meaning,\nto attach meaning and purpose\nto things that otherwise\nare just reflexive.\nAnd in the example of an ice bath,\nit might be a little trivial.\nIn the example of the\nkid with a car accident,\nit becomes a little more relevant.\nAnd in the example of things\nlike people surviving,\nyou know, genocide or attaching\nstories of great victory\nto what were previously thought\nof as stories of great loss\nof time, of people, of\nany number of things.\nThat process of narrative\nis one of the major ways\nthat the human brain rewires itself.\nNarrative should not be\nundervalued as a tool\nfor relieving fear and trauma.\nIn fact, narrative is one of the best\nand most potent ways that we\ncan rewire our fear circuitry.\nAnd that indeed we can form\ncompletely new relationships\nto things over time.\nSo basically narratives\nshould not be undervalued\nas a tool to rewire our nervous system\nbut it has to be engaged\nin the correct sequence.\nAnd that correct sequence\nis first extinction,\nthen relearning a new narrative\nwith positive associations\nand attaching those positive associations\nto the formerly traumatic\nor fearful event.\nNow I mentioned prolonged\nexposure therapy,\ncognitive processing, and\ncognitive behavioral therapy.\nFor those of you that are\nseeking relief from fear\nand traumatic events,\nyou can look up licensed\nclinicians that can carry out\nthose one or several of\nthose types of therapies.\nI get a lot of questions\nabout other forms of therapy.\nOne of the ones that comes\nup a lot is so-called\nEMDR, Eye Movement\nDesensitization and Reprocessing\ndeveloped by Francine Shapiro in the 80s.\nEye Movement Desensitization\nand Reprocessing involves\nmoving the eyes side to side\nwhile recounting a traumatic\nor fearful narrative typically\nwith a clinician present.\nWhy would that work?\nWell, basically when I\nfirst heard about EMDR\nfrom my stance as a vision scientist\nI thought the whole\nthing was kind of crazy\nand half-baked frankly.\nI heard these theories that,\n\"Oh, it recreates the eye movements\nin rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep.\"\nAnd that's completely false.\nIt does not.\nI heard the argument EMDR\nactivates both sides of the brain,\nwhich I guess hypothetically\nwas thought to be important somehow.\nAnd frankly, there's\nno evidence whatsoever\nthat EMDR activates\nboth sides of the brain\nin a way that's beneficial.\nI mean, by looking from side to side,\njust because of the way that\nbinocular vision circuits\nare organized it will do that.\nBut it never made any sense\nto me why EMDR would work\nuntil several years ago when I saw.\nBecause I reviewed no\nfewer than five papers.\nSome in animal models, others in humans\nlooking at lateral eye movements.\nMeaning I moving from side\nto side with eyes open,\nnot eyes up or down.\nAnd what was observed in these experiments\nin all of them actually,\nall five of those papers\nwas a dramatic reduction\nin the activation and\nactually an inhibition\na suppression of the fear\nor threat reflect circuitry\nwhich was a jaw dropper for me.\nI thought, \"Wow, it\nactually was a jaw dropper.\"\nI widened that.\nFor me, I thought, \"Oh my goodness,\nmaybe this EMDR stuff works\naccording to some mechanism.\nAnd maybe this is the mechanism.\"\nAnd indeed many laboratories, not mine,\nbut many laboratories are\nnow pursuing that idea.\nAnd it's looking very likely.\nWhy would that happen?\nWell, just very briefly,\na lateralized eye movements of\nthe sort that I'm describing\nand I'm moving my hand like this\nbut I'll just do it with my eyes\neven though it's a little\nembarrassing to do that.\nCause I know it looks\nstrange, I don't mind\ncause I'm doing EMDR and\nEMDR reduces activation\nof the amygdala and related circuitries\nwhich reduces anxiety\nand reduces the amplitude\nof the threat reflex.\nReduces sympathetic autonomic arousal.\nIn other words, we feel\ncalmer or we feel less alert,\nless stressed when moving\nour eyes from side to side.\nI just heard a story about this is that\nthese are the sorts of\neye movements that we do\nwhen we are ambulating,\nmoving through space,\nthrough some sort of\nself-generated motion.\nAnd one can make up a\npretty reasonable story\nin the evolutionary context\nor ecological context\nthat forward movement and fear\nare generally incompatible\nwith one another.\nThat generally a fear\nresponse involves a freezing\nor a retreating.\nSome people will advance,\nbut that's usually a trained\nadvance in response to fear\nso first responders and so forth.\nMost people freeze or\nretreat when they're afraid.\nForward movement generates\nthese eye movements.\nIt does seem to suppress\nactivation of this threat reflex\nand the amygdala in particular.\nSo for the many EMDR\npractitioners out there\nthese papers I think\nare a great celebration.\nAnd I think there is now\nincreasing excitement about EMDR\nin the psychiatric and\npsychological community\nfor its utility, for treating\nfear, trauma and PTSD.\nHowever, I should point\nout that in discussing EMDR\nwith various colleagues of\nmine at Stanford and elsewhere,\nI was told that EMDR has\nbeen shown to be beneficial\nin particular for single\nevent type traumas\nor fearful experiences.\nNot so much for relieving the trauma\nor feelings of fear associated.\nFor instance, with an entire bad marriage\nor an entire childhood.\nBut more for single more acute\nevents that can be described\nwithin a very kind of brief narrative.\nBrief, not necessarily in time,\nbut that the car accident,\nthe bad interaction\nwith another individual,\nthe assault, God forbid,\nthese sorts of things.\nAnd I realize we're down\nin the weeds of topics\nthat are unpleasant.\nAnd so I have great sensitivity to that\nbut I think it's also\nimportant that we be realistic\nabout the kinds of things\nthat traumatize people.\nSo is EMDR useful?\nWell, it seems like it\nworks for these single event\nor kind of constrained event type traumas\nthat people can describe\nwhile moving their eyes from side to side\ngenerally in the presence of a clinician.\nHowever, if we think back to the model\nof how you extinguish and\nthen replace a trauma or fear,\nremember you have to\ndiminish the old experience\nthe amplitude of that.\nYou need to...\nThat's the extinguish portion.\nThen you need to relearn a new narrative\nand attach reward to\nthe old traumatic event.\nEMDR only really taps into the extinction\nof the physiological response\nto the old experience.\nI'm sure that there are\nEMDR practitioners out there\nthat are thinking about the attaching\nof the new narrative and reward,\nbut there I've heard less\nand I've seen fewer\npeer-reviewed papers on that.\nSo let's think about this logically.\nLet's say, and indeed it's the case\nthat I'm sitting down in a chair\nand moving eyes side to side deliberately\nfor some period of time\nreduces activation of the threat reflex.\nI or the patient in this case,\nrecites or repeats over and\nover the traumatic event\nor the fearful event.\nI'm doing that in the presence\nof a lower amplitude response.\nRemember back to where we\ntalked about how the retelling\nworks best if the first time it's done\nthere's a huge amplitude response.\nAnd then with each successive\nrepeat that response\nthe threat response gets lower and lower.\nWith EMDR, you're sort of short circuiting\nyou're kind of sneaking around the corner\nof that high amplitude response.\nAnd so it's taking a\nsomewhat different approach\nof trying to extinguish the bad feelings\nin body and mind associated\nwith an experience\nby reducing the physiological response.\nSo it's somewhat different.\nAnd at least to my knowledge\nand EMDR practitioners\nplease correct me, but\nat least to my knowledge,\nthere isn't an active component to EMDR\nof relearning a new narrative\nand attaching reward.\nNow reward and attaching reward requires\na somewhat high amplitude\nsympathetic arousal.\nIt requires a feeling of a\nvictory which is arousal, okay?\nIt's positive arousal,\nnot negative arousal,\nbut it is arousal.\nSo I'm not focusing on\nthis to try and diminish\nthe potential impact of EMDR.\nI know many people have\nachieved great relief from EMDR\nbut it doesn't tap into all\nthe aspects of the extinction\nand relearning that we\ntalked about previously.\nAnd therefore, I think on its own\nat least in many cases is\nunlikely to be a complete therapy\nfor fear and trauma.\nIf there are people out there\nwho've had terrific results\nwith the EMDR, please let us\nknow in the comment section,\non YouTube would be the ideal place.\nIf you've had bad experiences with EMDR\nor it didn't work for\nyou also let us know.\nI think that EMDR practitioners\nlike most practitioners\nin the psychiatric and psychological space\nare eager to expand their practices\nin order to make them more effective\nrather than clinging\nardently to something that\nperhaps is incomplete or that doesn't work\nfor certain individuals.\nSo I think they would appreciate\nthat feedback as would I.\nSo, as I mentioned before,\nmost of these therapies\nare done in conjunction\nwith a skilled often one would\nhope credentialed clinician.\nThere are many people however,\nthat don't have access to that\nor who are working through stuff.\nThey have things in their past\nthat are very uncomfortable to them.\nAnd I'm aware that many people are working\nthrough those things.\nThrough journaling, through\ntalking to a friend,\nthrough any number of different\nsort of non-traditional approaches.\nOne thing that really\npertains to everybody\nwho's working through fear\nand trauma of any kind\nis the importance of social connection\nas it relates to the chemical systems\nand the neural circuits\nassociated with fear and trauma.\nAnd this is a emerging\nliterature in Neuroscience\nthat is really a beautiful one because\nit's a very conserved biology.\nWe see it, believe it or not\nin flies and fruit flies,\na commonly used model system.\nIn mice and indeed in humans as well.\nAnd this is the work of David\nAnderson's group at Caltech,\nagain, of Dr. Ressler's\ngroup at Harvard Medical\nand elsewhere, of course.\nAnd this is the work as\nit relates to Tachykinin.\nTachykinin is a very interesting\nmolecule in our brain\nand it turns out the\nTachykinin is activated\nin neurons of what's\ncalled the central amygdala\nand some nearby structures.\nSo really smack dab within the\nmiddle of this threat reflex.\nVery soon after some traumatic\nor fear inducing event occurs.\nAnd it actually sets in motion\na number of other things\nincluding changes in gene\nexpression and potentiation\nmeaning long-term potentiation,\nactivation of an NMDA receptors and so on.\nIn the circuits that\nreinforce that fearful\nor traumatic experience.\nNow what's interesting about Tachykinin\nis also that it's been shown to lead\nto low to moderate levels of anxiety\nand even kind of aggression, irritability.\nTachykinin levels are further\nincreased by social isolation.\nAnd that social isolation is\noftentimes what can exacerbate\npre-existing traumas or fearful events.\nAnd in a kind of\nbeautiful symmetry to that\nkind of dark and depressing story,\nsocial connection with\npeople that we trust.\nAnd it doesn't have to be\ndirect physical contact\nbut just social connection\nconversing with,\nsharing a meal with,\nit could be physical touch\nif that's appropriate.\nThose sorts of connections\nactually serve to reduce\nthe effectiveness or even\nthe levels of Tachykinin.\nSo the important point here is that\ntrauma is traumatic in and of itself.\nFearful events are hard\nin and of themselves.\nAnd if people are working through them\neither through clinical work\nor through individual work.\nIt is important and in ideally\none would still be trying\nto access social connection\noutside of that specific\nwork-related to the trauma.\nNow it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be outside of that.\nFor instance, if you\nhave a good relationship\nwith a clinician or therapist\nto the point where there's real trust\nand you feel a social\nconnection with them, wonderful.\nBut for many people,\nthey have a more\ntransactional relationship\nto the EMDR practitioner\nor to their therapist,\nor they're working through\nthings on their own.\nAnd it's really important to understand\nthat regular social connection,\ntrusting social connection of any kind\nis going to be very\nbeneficial for that process.\nAnd so this is not the\nkind of just hand-wavy,\na new agey stuff like,\n\"Oh, you know you need social connection.\"\nThere's a actual neurochemical\nbasis for social isolation\nthat has an amplifying\neffect on fear and trauma.\nAnd there is a neurochemical\nbasis for the relief\nfrom fear and trauma and isolation.\nAnd in the ideal circumstance,\none is working through\nthese traumas and fears\nvery intensely in a very dedicated way.\nBut then is also engaging\nin the sorts of social interactions\nthat are going to diminish\nthe amount of Tachykinin\nand going to suppress those very circuits\nthat would otherwise be amplified.\nSo next I'd like to talk\nabout some really interesting\nand almost kind of eerie\nscientific findings.\nAnd that's the transgenerational\npassage of trauma\nor predisposition to fear and trauma.\nThis is a scientific\nliterature that's been debated\nmany times over the last\nreally 50 plus years.\nBut in more recent\nstudies have really proven\nthat we as humans have\nthe capacity to inherit\na predisposition to trauma or fear.\nNow that doesn't necessarily\nmean that we will become\ntraumatized or experience extreme fear\njust because our parents or\ngrandparents experienced that.\nIt's a predisposition, it's a bias.\nLet me explain the\npapers that focus on this\nfor a little bit.\nAnd then we'll talk about what\nthis means for each of us.\nOne of the most important\npapers in this area\ncomes to us from someone\nI mentioned earlier,\nDr. Kerry Ressler at Harvard.\nAnd the title of the paper is,\nAssociation of FKBP5\npolymorphisms and childhood abuse\nwith risk of posttraumatic\nstress disorder symptoms\nin adults.\nAnd there are other papers as well.\nAnother one from the Ressler's Lab,\nfirst author, Brian Dias, D-I-A-S.\nParental olfactory experience\ninfluences behavior\nand neural structure in\nsubsequent generations.\nI'm going to summarize these\npapers and their general contour\nand papers related to them.\nAlthough, feel free to look up\nthe papers I just described.\nWe will provide a link\nto them in the caption\nif you'd like to go further.\nBut basically these explorations involve\nlooking at the histories\nof human individuals\nwho had trauma or abuse of\nsome kind in their childhood.\nAnd then looking at the likelihood of fear\nand PTSD type symptomology\nin their offspring.\nAnd essentially what they\nidentified is that indeed,\nif you had a parent and there does seem\nto be a kind of a bias\ntoward an effect where\nif the father had abuse\nand it's severe abuse\nor moderate abuse.\nThat abuse causes a\nchange in his genetics,\nin his sperm that can be\npassed on to offspring\nsuch that the offspring\nhave a lower threshold\nto develop trauma or extreme fear\nto certain types of events.\nNow what's important to point\nout is that predisposition\nor bias is not necessarily\nto the same sorts of events.\nIt's not that the abuse itself gets passed\nfrom one generation to the\nnext it's a predisposition.\nAnd the title of that paper mentioned,\nFKB5, excuse me, FKBP5 polymorphisms.\nAnd the FKBP5 polymorphisms\nmaps to a location\nin the genome that's associated\nwith the so-called glucocorticoid system\nwith cortisol release.\nSo the predisposition\nthat one might inherit\nfrom having a parent father or mother\nbut stronger tendency to\ninherit it from the father.\nWho experienced abuse is one in which\nthe glucocorticoid system,\nthe cortisol system,\nand that HPA axis that\nwe talked about before\nthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis is sensitized\nor reactive in a way that\nsets a lower threshold\nto become traumatized or very afraid\nof certain types of events.\nBut it's not unique to\nthe specific type of abuse\nthat the parent experienced.\nNow, this is really, really important\nbecause a lot of times out there\nI will hear that there's passage\nor transgenerational\npassage of actual trauma,\nthe specific trauma.\nNow that could be through\nnarrative telling,\nif somebody is exposed\nto a lot of narrative\nabout their parents' trauma\nin one form or another.\nIt may be that they start to internalize\nsome of that trauma.\nAnd there could be because we\nobviously can't rule it out.\nThere could be some other signatures\nof prior specific traumas they\nget passed on to offspring.\nBut more likely and\ncertainly what these data\nabout these polymorphisms point to\nis that what gets passed\non is a propensity\nfor the threat reflex to\nget activated and attached\nto a wider variety or to\nless intense types of inputs\nand experiences.\nAnd the important point\nto take away from this\nis that it's not some magical, mysterious,\nand mystical thing\nthat's being transplanted\nfrom parent to child.\nIt's a gene or it's a\nmodification in a set of genes\nthat gives a heightened\nlevel of responsivity\nto fearful type events.\nOr even a high level of responsivity\nsuch that things that\nwouldn't be fear inducing\nor trauma inducing to certain individuals\ncan trigger fear and\ntrauma in these children\nthat inherit this particular gene.\nNow that doesn't necessarily\nmean that they are faded\nto forever be traumatized or live in fear.\nIt's simply not the case.\nIt's just a genetic predisposition\nregardless of whether or not\nyou had a parent or parents\nthat were traumatized or not.\nThere's no evidence, at\nleast as far as I'm aware\nthat the treatments for trauma\nshould be any different.\nAs far as I know there\naren't gene therapies\ncurrently aimed at these\nparticular variants,\nlike FKBP5 and so forth that\ncould reverse those particular\ngenetic underpinnings of\nthe trauma predisposition.\nSo this transgenerational\npassage of trauma,\nI think is extremely\ninteresting in large part\nbecause it brings us back to this idea\nthat the threat reflux is part\nof a larger sensory system.\nYou know, normally we think\nof seeing as a sensory system\nor hearing as a sensory system.\nBut the threat detection\nand threat learning system,\nthe fear learning system is\nin many ways a sensory system.\nIt's just a sensory system\nthat is very generic\nin its response.\nThat generic response again is good\nbecause it allows for flexibility\nbut it's bad because it\nreduces specificity, right?\nWe can essentially become fearful\nor traumatized by anything if\nthe circuit gets activated.\nAnd these particular children\ninherit a predisposition\nfor more things and less intense\nthings to traumatize them.\nIn a few minutes, we are going to discuss\nsome of the behavioral treatments\nincluding some really\nnew exciting protocols\nfor dealing with fear and trauma.\nBut for a few minutes,\nI'd like to discuss some\nof the drug treatments\nthat are starting to emerge\nas potential therapeutics\nin particular for PTSD.\nThe two drug treatments\nI'd like to focus on\nare Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy,\nand MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.\nCurrently Ketamine-Assisted\nPsychotherapy is legal.\nIt is approved, provided it is prescribed\nby a board certified physician\nin the United States.\nI'm not certain about\nother areas of the world.\nMDMA also sometimes called Ecstasy therapy\nis in clinical trials in the U S,\nit is still an illegal\ndrug to possess or to sell.\nSo I want to be very clear about that.\nHowever, MDMA is being explored\nas a potential therapeutic for PTSD\nand other forms of trauma.\nAnd of course, Ketamine and MDMA\nare also both being explored\nfor chronic depression,\neating disorders and a number of other\npsychiatric disorders.\nBut for the moment I would\njust like to touch on\nKetamine and MDMA as they relate\nto the fear circuitry and trauma circuitry\nthat we've described in the\nearly part of the episode\nand throughout the episode.\nBecause I think that in\nviewing them through that lens,\nwe can gain some additional insight\ninto how they might be\nproviding the sorts of relief\nthat some of the early clinical studies\nare starting to point to.\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic.\nThat's right.\nIt's a dissociative anesthetic.\nIt's main function is to\ncreate a state of dissociation.\nAnd I've never taken ketamine personally\nso I can't describe the experience of it.\nBut a colleague of mine in psychiatry\nshared their experience with\na patient's experience of it\nas making that patient feel as if,\n\"They were getting out of\nthe cockpit of a plane,\nbut that they were observing\nthemselves doing it.\"\nAnd this was of course,\nduring a approved therapeutic session\nthat they were doing this\nand they were in some sort\nof intense visualization\nabout a traumatic experience.\nThey were describing some\nof their depressive symptoms\nas well as the trauma.\nAnd their narrative that\nthey basically created\nor took away from this.\nAnd that was relayed\nto me was one in which\nthe patient felt like they\nwere in their own body\nbut they were also viewing\ntheir own body from the outside.\nSo dissociative, in other words.\nAgain, I've never had this experience.\nSome of you may have with\nKetamine or through other means.\nBut we might want to just\ntake a moment and think about\nwhat Ketamine actually does\nand what dissociation actually does\nat the level of neurocircuits?\nAnd for that, we can look to\nthis really beautiful paper\nthat was published by my colleagues,\nKarl Deisseroth in psychiatry,\nRobert Malenka, also in\npsychiatry, Liqun Luo,\nalso at Stanford.\nThey paired up or teamed\nup rather to explore\nhow systemic Ketamine adjust\ncircuitries in the brain.\nAnd what they discovered was that\nit changes the rhythm of cortical activity\nin certain layers of the cortex.\nThe cortex is like a layered sandwich.\nThe cortex of course, being\nthe outside of the brain.\nAnd there was a particular rhythm\na one to three hertz rhythm.\nOne to three hertz just\nmeans a particular frequency\nof electrical activity.\nIn this case,\nin these layer 5 neurons\nof Retrosplenial cortex.\nSo you don't need to know much\nabout Retrosplenial cortex\nor a one to three hertz rhythms.\nI think the important thing\nto just take away from this\nis that there is now starting\nto be an understanding\nof how drugs like Ketamine work\nto create this subjective\nexperience that this patient\nand other patients\ndescribe as dissociation.\nYou know, dissociation in its essence\nis really about not\nfeeling what's happening.\nIt's about viewing what's happening\nfrom a different perspective\nthan what normally\none would view that experience from.\nAnd so if we add a plug that\ngeneral notion of dissociation\nand Ketamine induced\nassociation into the circuit\nthat we talked about before,\nwhere we have this threat\nreflex involving the amygdala.\nThese outputs for freezing or\nfor reward and the accumbens.\nAnd we've got this prefrontal\nnarrative coming down\nas top-down processing.\nIt brings us right to that\nprefrontal cortical input\nto the threat system and that narrative.\nWhat seems to be the case\nin my review of the paper\nI just described,\nplus a review on how\nKetamine-assisted trauma relief\nmight work is that it\nsomehow allows the patient,\nthe individual to recount\ntheir trauma while feeling\neither none or a very different\nset of emotional experiences\nthat they experienced in the actual trauma\nor fearful experience.\nSo it's a remapping of new onto old.\nNew meaning new feelings onto\nold feelings while staying\nin the exact same narrative.\nSo it's a little bit\nlike EMDR of suppressing\nthe threat reflex but it seems\nto bring in a replacement\nof previous emotional\nexperiences and sensations\nin the body with new ones.\nAnd so in that way we can sort of view\nor we can try and view\nKetamine-Assisted Psychotherapy\nfor the treatment of\ntrauma as bringing together\nthe three elements that\nwe talked about before.\nYou want to diminish the intensity,\nthe potency of the old\noriginal trauma experience\nor fear experience.\nSo that seems to be accomplished\nthrough this dissociation\nand maybe through the kind\nof anesthetic component.\nSo it's a reduction in pain\nin the body, a dissociation,\na kind of observing of the self\nthat leads to the extinction\nof the trauma and the fear.\nBut then there also\nseems to be an automatic\nor kind of built in a\nrelearning of a new narrative,\na new set of experiences\nwhich is the next step\nthat we described earlier.\nSo it's an intriguing therapy.\nIt's one that's really catching on\nand there are many, many\nclinics around the U S\nthat are now doing it.\nWhether or not it turns out\nto be the ultimate treatment\nfor trauma and for fear isn't clear.\nMy colleagues in psychiatry\ntell me that that's unlikely,\nalthough it does seem to be beneficial\nfor a number of people.\nEspecially people that\nare experiencing trauma\nor have existing traumas and fear\nthat are coupled with depressive symptoms.\nBecause the data on\nKetamine and depression\nseems to be quite strong.\nSo now let's talk about MDMA.\nMDMA also sometimes\ncalled Ecstasy or Molly\nin its recreational form is\na powerful synthetic drug\nthat at least as far as we know,\ncreates a state in the brain\nand body that is unlike\nany other chemical state\nin the brain and body\nthat's normally experienced.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, we have several\nNeuromodulator systems in our body.\nNeuromodulators are chemicals\nthat change the likelihood\nthat certain neural\ncircuits will be active.\nMeaning they can make it very\nlikely that certain circuits\nwill be active and make it\nvery unlikely that other\nneural circuits will be active.\nGood examples of neuromodulators\nare dopamine, serotonin,\nacetylcholine, norepinephrine.\nThese tend to work on different systems\nin the brain and body but\nthey tend to be activated\nmore or less in parallel, right?\nYou can have Dopamine\nreleased in your brain\nand also Norepinephrine.\nYou can have Serotonin\nreleased in your brain\nand also Acetylcholine.\nSo it's not an all or none kind of thing,\nbut the degrees to which\nthese things are activated\ntends to vary.\nAnd there is a little bit\nof a seesaw type phenomenon\nwith Dopamine and Serotonin.\nDopamine most commonly\nassociated with activating\nneurocircuits related to\nmotivation, craving, and reward.\nAnd Serotonin more typically activated\nin response to situations or conditions\nin which we are very happy\nand content with what we have.\nSo Dopamine is more about\npursuing and seeking.\nSerotonin is more about kind\nof pleasure and satisfaction\nwith resources that we have\nin our immediate sphere.\nThey don't tend to...\nSerotonin doesn't tend to\nplace the brain and body\ninto a mode of action\nquite as much as Dopamine\ndoes, more or less.\nMDMA is a unique compound in that it leads\nto very large increases\nin the amount of both\nDopamine and Serotonin in the\nbrain and body simultaneously.\nAnd that's a unique circumstance\nthat is just simply not\nseen under normal conditions.\nFrom a subjective standpoint,\npeople under the influence of MDMA\nin the therapeutic setting,\ntend to report immense feelings\nof connection or resonance\nwith people or even things\nwith music, with objects.\nCertainly if it's being\ndone in conjunction\nwith a family member or a\npartner or with a therapist,\nthey will feel extremely\nconnected to that person.\nThey'll feel a very close\nunderstanding and association.\nOftentimes that goes beyond words.\nThere is a chemical reason for that.\nIt turns out that MDMA causes\nmassive release of oxytocin.\nThis neuropeptide that's\nassociated with pair bonding\nand with bonding generally.\nThe oxytocin system and\nthe Serotonin system\nare closely linked to one\nanother in the brain and body.\nAnd they tend to be co-released\noften at the same times\nand by the same sorts of events.\nSo MDMA is one mechanism by\nwhich oxytocin is released\nin these massive amounts.\nAnd I should just relay some\nof the levels of oxytocin\nbecause they're really quite striking,\ngives a kind of a more vivid\npicture of why it is the MDMA\nwould make people feel so\nassociated in a positive way\nwith the various things\nthat are happening them\nwhile they're under the\ninfluence of the drug.\nSo the paper related to this\nthat I'd like to highlight\nis in the journal\nPsychoneuroendocrinology.\nThe title of the paper is\nPlasma oxytocin concentrations\nfollowing MDMA or intranasal\noxytocin in humans.\nAnd just remarkably MDMA\nincreased plasma oxytocin levels\nto 83.7, this is an average,\n83.7 picograms per milliliter.\nAbout 90 to 120 minutes\ninto the MDMA session\ncompared to a typical level of 18.6.\nSo this is a massive increase in oxytocin.\nAnd I think that massive\nincrease in oxytocin\nis part of the reason\nwhy people have these\nfeelings of close\nresonance and association.\nNow, the Dopamine increases\nare generally what lead\nto the feelings of euphoria\ninside of the MDMA session.\nAnd then the Serotonin\nincreases it is thought\nare what lead to the feelings\nof safety and comfort.\nSo again, a very unusual chemical cocktail\nthat would never be seen at\nleast not at this amplitude\nunder any normal conditions\noutside of an MDMA\nclinical psychotherapeutic session.\nWhy would this state of mind\nand body be potentially useful\nfor the treatment of trauma?\nWell, indeed it is revealing\nitself to be useful\nfor the treatment of trauma.\nAgain, these are legal clinical trials\nwhere people are doing\nthis and discovering this.\nWhat it seems to allow\nis a very fast relearning\nor new associations to be tacked on\nto the previously traumatic experience.\nSo again, it brings us\nback to the same model\nof how people extinguish fears and traumas\nand replace them with new experiences\nwhen there is no drug treatment involved.\nThere needs to be a diminishing\nof the old experience,\nmeaning an extinction\nand then a relearning\nof a new narrative.\nWhat the chemical [indistinct] of MDMA\nseems to be doing is\ncreating an opportunity\nfor all that to happen very fast\nwithout the need for many\nrepetitions of the original trauma\nand reliving of the original trauma.\nProbably because the reliving of it inside\nof one of these MDMA sessions\nis very acute, very intense,\nplus it seems to be\noffering the opportunity\nto extinguish and rewrite in or write in\na new narrative associated\nwith that trauma\nvery quickly as well.\nSo what this means is\nthat treatments like MDMA\nthat are under investigation\nin these clinical trials\nare unlikely to be magic\npotions, if you will,\nthat allow access to a particular process\nthat would otherwise not be accessible.\nIt's more that the\ntypical process of trauma\nand fear reduction that's\ncarried out in things like\nprolonged exposure, cognitive processing,\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nseems to be compacted\ninto a much shorter session.\nAnd that session is performed\nat a much higher intensity.\nHigher intensity because\nthe chemical [indistinct]\nof the brain is completely different.\nI mean, the experience of\nMDMA is one in which people\nhave a very heightened sense of euphoria,\nvery heightened sense of connection.\nSo those positive experiences\nare essentially primed\nto be written in and over\nthe traumatic experience\nand because of the high levels\nof Serotonin in the system\nand probably oxytocin as well,\nthere's a safety that's\nwritten into the situation\nthat allows people to lean\ninto perhaps narratives\nor components of narratives\nthat they would otherwise\nbe holding back from.\nSo these are powerful compounds,\nand I think the future of\nMDMA-assisted psychotherapy\nfor a trauma in particular\nis holding great promise.\nAs of now, meaning at\nthe time of the recording\nof this podcast.\nAgain, I want to reiterate\nthat these are clinical trials\nare being done legally.\nThese drugs are still\nillegal to possess or sell\noutside of clinical trials.\nDoing this sort of thing is punishable.\nBut it does seem that the FDA\nand some of the related bodies\nthat control these sorts of things\nare eyes open to this stuff.\nAnd I think it's very likely\nin the next few years,\nthings like MDMA and\ncertainly Ketamine has already\nin widespread use within\nthe psychiatric community.\nAnd I think we're going to\nbe seeing a lot more of that.\nOne thing we have not touched on yet\nis how do you know if you're traumatized?\nHow do you know if you have chronic fear\nor a debilitating fear?\nYou know, much of the\npsychiatric community\nfocuses on how many other\nproblems people might have.\nTrouble sleeping, trouble eating,\ntrouble maintaining\nquality work, or schoolwork\nand so forth.\nAnd all of those are\ncertainly very valid criteria\nand necessary criteria for determining\nwhether or not somebody meets\na clinical diagnosis or not.\nBut there's a biological component\nthat I think we can all\nassess for ourselves.\nAnd that's one of\ninteroceptive versus\nexteroception balance.\nAnd that sounds confusing,\nbut it's actually really\neasy to understand.\nWe can focus our perception\non the external world,\nevents going on around us,\nbeyond the confines of our skin\nor within the confines of our skin.\nA focus and a perception\non the external world\nis what's called exteroception\nand a focus on what's happening\ninside us is interoception.\nAnd we have the capacity\nto build mental appraisal\ninto that, right?\nI can for instance, stop\nfor a moment and assess\nhow my stomach feels, how hungry I feel,\nhow quick my heart is beating.\nSome people by the way\nare much better at sensing\nwhether or not their heart is\nbeating at a particular rate\nand others, not so much.\nSome people can actually\ncount their heartbeats without\nhaving to take their\npulse by placing pressure\non their wrist or their neck.\nSome people can't.\nIn other words, some people have very high\ninteroceptive awareness\nand other people less so.\nThis whole business of fear\nand trauma relates to taking\nexternal experiences and\nfunneling those experiences\ninto this thing that I'm\ncalling a threat reflux\nor the fear circuitry.\nA recent paper published\nin the journal Science.\nSo absolutely spectacular\njournal, science, nature and cell\nbeing the apex journals\nof scientific publishing.\nGets at this issue of where in our mind\nand how do we assess whether or not\nwhat we are feeling\ninternally is reasonable\ngiven what's going on externally.\nAnd it's a really fascinating study.\nI'm just going to highlight\na little bit of it for you\nand then I'll touch on some\nof the relevant aspects\nand how that can be\nadopted into a practice\nto assess and reduce fear and anxiety.\nThe title of this paper\npublished just a few weeks ago\nin Science is,\nFear balance is maintained\nby bodily feedback\nto the insular cortex in mice.\nWe've not talked too\nmuch about the insular,\nalso called the insular cortex.\nThis is a brain area\nthat my lab has worked on\nand other labs have worked on.\nIt's a brain area that has within it\na map of our internal\ninteroceptive landscape.\nIt's a map of our internal\nbodily sensations.\nAnd it's a really interesting structure.\nSo the way this study\nwas carried out is that\nsubjects were taught or conditioned\nto a particular danger signal\nthrough repeated presentation\nof a sound with a foot shock.\nSo there's a sound and\nthere's a foot shock.\nAnd as you know, from\nour earlier discussion\nabout Pavlovian learning,\nconditions stimulate,\nan unconditioned stimulate.\nEventually the sound alone comes\nto evoke the fear response.\nAnd that's just classic,\nclassical conditioning.\nThe insular is this brain\narea that's associated\nwith determining whether or\nnot one's internal sensations,\ngut, heart, lungs, et cetera,\nare reasonable or not given\nthe external circumstances.\nIt can even measure or is associated with\nour understanding of what are\ncalled arterial baroreceptors.\nThese are blood pressure sensors.\nSo believe or not, when you\nknow your pulse rate increases\nor you feel like you're stressed out,\nyour arterial baroreceptors\nare sending a signal\nto your insular cortex and\nyour insular cortex is saying,\nwow, like I'm really stressed out,\nmy blood pressure is up, right?\nYou don't actually have to\nmeasure your blood pressure\nwith a cuff, your insular\nis doing it for you.\nIt's not getting a quantitative readout,\nbut it's getting a qualitative readout.\nThe main effect of inhibiting\nor reducing the activity\nof the insular was that the intensity\nof an outside world\nexperience led to a range\nof different internal effects.\nIn other words, for most people\na mild shock would induce a\nmild increase in heart rate,\na mild increase in blood pressure.\nWhereas an intense shock to the skin\nwould lead to a big increase in heart rate\nand a big increase in blood pressure.\nTurns out the insular is\nimportant for establishing\nthat match of intensity.\nAnd when the insular is inhibited,\nwhat ends up happening\nis that a mild shock\ncan create a big increase\nin blood pressure.\nAnd that can be maintained\nsuch that anything\nthat's paired with that shock like a bell,\nor a tone would lead to a big\nincrease in blood pressure.\nYou've probably seen examples\nof this in the real world.\nMaybe this is even you.\nSome people are very jumpy in response\nto just even small changes\nin their environment.\nSo if somebody is working and you walk in\nand you say, \"Hello.\"\nAnd they'll go, they're jumpy.\nThey have a low threshold to a\nbig anxiety or fear response.\nOther people are really calm.\nI recall my bulldog,\nunfortunately passed away,\nbut before he passed away,\nif you walked in the room\nand he said, \"Hey, Costello.\"\nHe might turn his eyes in your direction.\nHe had a very high threshold to respond.\nHe was pretty low anxiety animal.\nA lot of people are like that.\nYou'd come up behind\nsomeone you say, \"Hello.\"\nAnd they just turn around real slow,\nor they might just turn\naround at normal speeds\nand say, \"Hello.\"\nWhereas other people\njump out of their seat.\nThe insular seems to be\ninvolved in calibrating\nhow big or how high amplitude\na given physiological response is.\nSo it's pairing the internal landscape\nwith the external world.\nAnd this might seem\nlike just a mechanistic,\nbut non-actionable point.\nBut what you'll see from the next study\nthat I'm going to describe\nis that recalibrating\nthe relationship between outside events\nand internal responses,\nwhich is the job of the\ninsular is actually something\nthat's under our control.\nAnd through a very simple,\nvery short protocol,\nwe can actually recalibrate\nthat system so much so\nthat we can potentially reduce the amount\nof fear and trauma that we experience,\nin response to a memory\nor to a real event.\nAnd the entire process\ncan occur very quickly.\nSo I'm really excited to tell\nyou about this next study\nfor a number of reasons.\nFirst of all, it's extremely recent.\nSecond of all, it's very well grounded\nin our current understanding\nof the mechanisms of stress,\ntrauma and PTSD and unlearning\nof stress, trauma and PTSD.\nAnd third, it points to\na actionable protocol\nthat while certainly is\nnot the only approach\nthat I think people could or should take\nfor fear, trauma and PTSD.\nIs one that I think we are\ngoing to see implemented\ninto the clinical setting very soon\nif it's not happening already.\nNow, there's a fourth reason\nI'm very interested in it,\nwhich is that my lab works on stress,\nstress-relief and tools for managing sleep\nand improving focus, et cetera.\nAnd one of the hallmarks of the studies\nwe've been doing lately is\nvery brief five minute a day\ninterventions of the sort that was used\nin this particular study.\nAlthough I should emphasize,\nI had nothing to do with\nthis particular study.\nNow this particular study was carried out\nin an animal model in mice.\nThe work in my laboratory\nfocuses on human subjects.\nBut the similarities of the stress system\nat least at the level that\nit was explored in this study\nI think have great relevance\nmaybe even direct relevance to humans.\nSo the title of this study is,\nRepeated exposure with\nshort-term behavioral stress\nresolves pre-existing stress-induced\ndepressive-like behavior in mice.\nAgain, this study was in mice.\nAnd basically what they did\nis they stressed out mice,\ngot them depressed, and you\nactually can do that in a mouse\nusing a restraint protocol.\nAnd that's a long lasting\nrestraint protocol,\na 15 minutes or more.\nMice Don't like it,\nyou do it often enough.\nThey stop working so hard in their life,\nin their mouse life to\ngain food, to gain mates.\nThey show depressive symptoms\nin a number of levels.\nThey show elevated glucocorticoids.\nYou see the same thing in humans, Okay?\nChronic stress in humans\nlasting weeks or more\ndoes the same exact thing.\nSo again, a very close match here in terms\nof mechanism overall.\nAnd then what they did was a\nvery counterintuitive thing.\nRather than give these\nanimals stress relief\nat the level of reducing their anxiety\nwith Benzodiazepines,\nor giving them a nice\nlittle mouse vacation,\nor enriched environment.\nThings that have been done\nin a lot of previous studies.\nWhat they did is they subjected\nthem to five minutes a day\nof intense stress, but\nonly five minutes a day.\nAnd what they found was miraculously,\nbut also very convincingly.\nDaily short bouts of intense\nstress actually undid,\nreversed the effects of chronic stress.\nAnd it did this at the\nlevel of glucocorticoids,\nof hormones, of neurotransmitters\nand a number of other\ndifferent mechanisms.\nNow, I find this very exciting\nfor a number of reasons\nbut in particular, because my\nlaboratory in collaboration\nwith David Spiegel laboratory,\nour associate chair of\npsychiatry at Stanford.\nBeen exploring how five minute\na day respiration protocols\ncan alleviate stress.\nAnd while those data\nare not yet published,\nthey are at the stage\nwhere I'm comfortable\ntalking about them.\nAnd we are seeing some very impressive\nand significant effects\non stress reduction\nnot just from respiration\nprotocols that allow people\nto calm themselves but\nalso respiration protocols\nthat bring people into a heightened state\nof autonomic sympathetic\narousal, AKA stress.\nAs my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,\nhe's an MD psychiatrist and PhD.\nLikes to say, \"When it comes\nto trauma, anxiety and PTSD,\nand the treatment of\ntrauma, anxiety, and PTSD,\nit's not just the state that\nyou are in or that you go into.\nIt's how you got there and\nwhether or not you had anything\nto do with it.\"\nAnd this brings us right back to those\ntop-down mechanisms and the narrative\naround what we are\nexperiencing internally.\nSo let's zoom out and I'll\nexplain how this works\nand what to do about it.\nWe have this brain structure\ncalled the insular.\nWe talked about the\ninsular a few minutes ago.\nThe insular is calibrating\nhow we feel internally\nversus what's going on externally.\nIt's involved in setting whether or not\nwhat we are feeling is appropriate\ngiven what's happening.\nWe have a system that can\ngenerate threat responses.\nAnd in the case of trauma,\nPTSD, and extreme stress,\nchronic stress, that system gets ramped up\nso that it takes very little,\nmaybe even just a memory\nor maybe even an association\nthat we're not even aware of,\nour location trigger something,\nwe're not even aware of it.\nAnd we start experiencing\nthat symptomology.\nHow do we recalibrate the system?\nWell, most of the approaches\nthat are out there\ninvolving drug treatments,\ntypical drug treatments would\ninvolve suppressing the level\nof internal arousal.\nJust trying to bring that down.\nNow, some of those drug treatments work.\nBut oftentimes they don't.\nAnd if you think about it,\nit's probably not\nsurprising that they don't\nbecause by taking a drug\nthat just lowers your anxiety overall\nyou're creating a different\nsort of miscalibration\nof the system.\nSo what we've been doing in human subjects\nis having them do either breathing\nprotocols that calm them,\nand I'll explain what that is in a moment,\nor doing breathing protocols that increase\ntheir level of autonomic arousal\nand seeing how that impacts their response\nto stress overall not just\nduring that particular\nbreathing protocol.\nSo the calming protocol that we use\ninvolves these physiological size.\nI've talked about these\npreviously on the podcast\nand elsewhere but if you\njust need a reminder,\nif you haven't heard about it.\nThere's a pattern of breathing\nthat we all do in sleep.\nWhen our carbon dioxide\nlevels in our bloodstream\nget too high.\nAnd we do this when we get claustrophobic,\nmeaning we do it reflexively.\nAnd that's a double\ninhale through the nose\nfollowed by a long exhale.\nSo it's,\n[Andrew breathing]\nAnd yes, the inhales\nshould be through the nose\nand yes, the exhales should be done\nthrough the mouth, ideally.\nSo it's a big filling of the\nlungs through two breaths\nback to back.\nInhales.\n[Andrew breathing]\nEven if you could only\nsneak in a little air\non that second one,\nno talking to if you're\ngoing to do it right.\nAnd then a long exhale,\nwhich allows you to offload\na lot of carbon dioxide\nin the exhale.\nAnd we have people doing that in real time\nanytime they experienced stress\nbut the particular breathing protocol\nthat we've been giving human subjects\nis for them to do the repeated...\nWhat we call cyclic sign.\nSo double inhale, exhale,\ndouble inhale, exhale,\ndouble inhale, exhale\nrepeatedly for five minutes.\nWhich is actually a pretty\nlong time to repeat that.\nBut you can do it pretty\nslowly and people report\nand the data point to the\nfact that it's very calming.\nPeople feel more relaxed afterwards\nand that relaxation wicks\nout into other aspects\nof their life.\nNow, we did not look at stress\nand trauma in that condition.\nWe also have another\ncondition where people do\nwhat's called cyclic hyperventilation,\nwhich is very different and\ncreates a very different\ninternal state and is somewhat stressful.\nIt's five minutes a day of stress\nmuch like the study that I just described.\nAnd involves basically doing this,\nwhat I'll do in a moment for five minutes\nwhich is hyperventilating.\nWhich is,\n[Andrew breathing]\nBut not continuously for the five minutes\nbecause many people would pass out\nor feel extremely uncomfortable.\nIt involves inhale,\nexhale, inhale, exhale,\nvery deep inhale through the\nnose, exhale through the mouth.\nAnd then every 25 or 30 breaths\nor so doing a full exhale\nand holding one's breath, lungs empty\nfor about 25, maybe 30,\nmaybe even 60 seconds.\nAnd then continuing\nuntil five minutes is up.\nSubjects report and our\ndata indicate that people\nfeel a heightened level\nof autonomic arousal.\nIn fact, I can feel it right now\neven from a very brief\ncyclic hyperventilation about\nI just did.\nYou feel a heating up, you feel a...\nSome people will perspire,\nsome people get wide-eyed,\nsome people feel agitated.\nThat's Adrenaline being\nreleased into your system.\nNow I'm not suggesting\neveryone run out and do this.\nAnd if you have a\npredisposition to panic attack\nor anxiety attacks please\ndon't do this because\nit is very stimulating\nand can trigger those sorts of attacks.\nBut this five minute a day protocol\nof cyclic hyperventilation\ndoes lead to big increases\nin autonomic arousal.\nSo it's \"Stressful\" but to bring us back\nto my colleague, David Spiegel's quote.\nIt really was him that said it, not me.\nIt's not just about the\nstate that you're in.\nIt's about the state that\nyou're in plus how you got there\nand whether or not you\ndirected entry into that state.\nAnd that point one directs\ntheir own entry into a state\ndeliberately is really key.\nAnd I think has an important\nimplications for whether or not\ntheir stress relief and fear\nrelief and trauma relief\nfrom bringing oneself into a state\nof increased autonomic arousal.\nWhy?\nBecause of the way that that\nfear and trauma circuitry\nis organized.\nIf you recall, it's got these components\nof how external events can trigger\nan internal stress\nresponse and fear response\nand trauma response.\nBut there's that top-down\nprefrontal component\nthat can inhibit certain\naspects of that fear\nand threat circuitry.\nNow, earlier we were talking about\nthat prefrontal circuit being\nengaged through narrative,\nthrough self-directed\ndeliberate narrative.\nIt's the person deliberately\nretelling the story?\nHere we're talking about\na deliberate reactivation\nof the sensations in the body.\nSo where I think this is all going,\nmeaning where my laboratory\nand the Spiegel laboratory\nand other laboratories\nout there are taking this.\nIs you can imagine a very\nbrief five minutes a day,\ntwo weeks was the time that they did this\nfor five minutes a day for two weeks.\nIntervention in which people,\nwith the support of a\nclinician we would hope,\nwould deliberately induce\na physiological state\nthat's very stressful, right?\nNot shying away from the stress response\nbut increasing their own\nstress response deliberately.\nAnd maybe in conjunction\nwith recounting the traumatic\nor fearful circumstance.\nThis is far and away different\nthan the kind of state of mind and body\nthat would come about\nin a Ketamine-assisted trauma\ninduced psychotherapy session,\nor a MDMA-assisted trauma\npsychotherapy session.\nOr in a purely narrative\nbased psychotherapy session\naimed at alleviating fear or trauma.\nThe reason I like these sorts\nof interventions is that,\nA, they are very low cost\nor even zero cost, right?\nOne you could imagine\ndoing this while journaling\nor while recounting a\nparticular experience.\nAgain, they're very\ncompact five minutes a day\nfor two weeks is what was done\nin this particular mouse study.\nWe don't know if that translates directly\nto the human study or not.\nWhat was interesting is that if they use\nthe longer daily bouts of\nstress, like 15 minutes a day,\nthat actually exacerbated the trauma\nand exacerbated the fear.\nSo one has to be very careful.\nStress and deliberate entry into stress\nand self stressing are very potent tools.\nThey're very sharp blades\nthat it does appear\nor it's likely can help\nalleviate trauma and fear.\nBut how long to do this?\nExactly what the protocol should be\nis still something that\nneeds to be cultivated.\nI know there are going to\nbe people out there that\nthat nonetheless are going\nto want to experiment\nwith some of this.\nI will say that I do not think it matters\nhow one gets into that stressed state\nprovided it as self-directed\nand that therefore could be cold shower.\nIt could be ice bath.\nIt could be anything\nthat induces an acute,\nmeaning a sudden onset of\nAdrenaline and is self-directed\nthat's really the key feature here.\nSo I'm very excited about these data\nboth the five minute intervention data\nfrom the animal study.\nThe work that's ongoing in my laboratory\nand Dr. Spiegel's laboratory,\nand the work that's being\ndone on the insular.\nBecause I think what\nwe're starting to see now\nis a picture of fear and trauma and PTSD\nthat has the sensory component,\nwhat's happening in the world around us.\nThis internal interoceptive component,\nhow appropriate are the signals\nthat are occurring in my body?\nI mean, let's face it.\nIf you almost get hit by\na car and your heart rate\nis 140 beats per second.\nAnd that lasts for a little\nwhile and you're stressed out,\nyou don't get the best night's\nsleep, that's pretty normal.\nThat means you have a healthy fear system.\nIf that persists and you're\ndealing with a lot of issues\na week later, six weeks\nlater, two years later.\nThen it's moved into the\nrealm of trauma and PTSD.\nSo we need to always\nbe taking into account\nthe different components of the circuitry.\nI do think that deliberate\nself-directed entry\ninto these short bouts of stress\nis a very promising approach.\nAnd it's one that if people\nare going to experiment\nI just again, want to\ncaution people with anxiety\nor panic disorders be very\ncautious, probably don't do it.\nIdeally you would do this\nin conjunction with support\nfrom a clinician.\nBut I'm also aware that there\nare a lot of people out there\nthat are dealing with trauma\nand dealing with post-traumatic\nstress of various kinds.\nAnd that they're desperate for various\nself directed intervention approaches.\nSo just very briefly, I want to\ntouch on some of the lifestyle\nand supplementation factors\nthat can impact things\nlike fear and trauma and\ngetting over fear and trauma.\nTo make a long story short.\nThere are many things that\nwe all can and should do\nto support our overall\nmental and physical health.\nAnd these are the foundational elements\nof quality nutrition.\nWhat that means to you?\nQuality sleep on a regular basis,\nample sleep on a regular basis.\nWe have an episode on how\nto master sleep in bed.\nWe have four episodes that\nyou can go to hubermanlab.com\nor elsewhere and scroll down\nand you can find those episodes\nin order to get your sleep\nreally dialed in as they say.\nIf you're sleeping regularly\nand for sufficient duration,\nall of the systems of your fear circuitry\nare going to function better.\nMainly because the\nautonomic nervous system\nbecomes very dysregulated\nwhen we are not getting good\nsleep on a regular basis.\nDysregulated means that out of nowhere\nwe can have a higher propensity\nto have sympathetic activation\nor we can feel really tired and wired.\nThat seesaw that I described\nearlier of alertness\nand calmness of sympathetic\nand parasympathetic.\nIn that analogy we can imagine that seesaw\nhas a hinge and that hinge\ncan neither be too tight\nnor too loose.\nIf it's too tight,\nyou can get locked into\nchronic activation of alertness\nor chronic fatigue.\nIf it's too loose, you're\nbouncing all over the place\nand you might be [indistinct]\ntired and wired one moment\nand then really hyper alert.\nSleep resets that balance\nand resets that hinge\nto the appropriate tightness, if you will.\nSo that all these circuits\nand not just the circuits related to fear\nbut also the circuits\nrelated to cognition,\nclear thinking to be able to spell out\nvery clear detailed narratives,\nto feel like you are in control.\nYou are deliberately bringing\nyourself into these protocols\nif that's what you intend to use.\nAll of that functions much better\nwhen you're sleeping well and eating well.\nWe talked about social connection.\nThose are all indirect\nsupports of trauma relief\nand of getting over fear\nbut they are essentia, okay?\nI think of them sort of like the tide.\nWhen the tide is high enough\na boat can leave harbor.\nAnd if the tide is not high enough,\nthen that boat is going\nto be stranded on shore.\nAnd in this analogy,\nthe boat stranded on shore is your attempt\nor anybody's attempt to try\nand work through something.\nVery hard to do when we're sleep deprived,\nvery hard to do when we're not fed enough\nor fed the proper foods for you.\nAnd that's a highly individual thing.\nAnd social connection as\nwe talked about earlier,\ncreates a general sense\nof support for the ability\nto move through things.\nBut also chemical support at the level\nof suppressing Tachykinin, okay?\nSo those foundational\nelements are absolutely key,\nbut they are indirect.\nI just want to briefly\nmention a few of the things\nthat some people find great benefit from\nin the supplementation realm\nas it relates to anxiety,\nstress, fear and PTSD.\nBut I want to point out that again,\nthese are somewhat\nindirect in their support\nand most of them focus on\nreducing anxiety overall.\nThe two that I want to focus\non are two that I've never\ntalked about on this podcast before\nbecause I've done\npodcasts before on stress\nand managing stress in\nthe kind of shorter term.\nSo we've talked about Ashwagandha\nin a previous podcast,\ncheck out the podcast on stress,\nif you're interested in\nhow that might be relevant\nas well as other tools.\nBut the two are interesting ones.\nThe first one is Saffron of all things.\nBut there are 12 studies,\nbelieve it or not.\nThat orally ingested\nSaffron at 30 milligrams\nseems to be a reliable\ndose for reducing anxiety\non the standard inventories.\nThe Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,\nfor those of you that want to know.\nAnd these are significant effects.\nAnd these were carried out in\nboth male and female subjects.\nHere I'm only referring to human studies.\nSeveral of these were\ndouble-blind studies.\nThere's a meta analysis\nof the positive effects.\nMeaning anxiolytic affects,\nanxiety reducing effects that\nis of things like Saffron.\nDefinitely have to check with your doctor\nand make sure it's right for you.\nBut they're fairly impressive effects\nwhen you really think about it\ngiven that these are legal\nover the counter substances.\nAgain, check with a doctor.\nThe other one is a Inositol.\nInositol has been shown to\ncreate a very notable decrease\nin anxiety symptoms.\nIt's a fairly high dose that's\nused but believe it or not,\nthe potency of this\neffect is on par with many\nof the prescription antidepressants.\nThat's pretty impressive.\nThese studies again are\ndouble-blind studies\nthat all showed decreases in anxiety.\nThese were done in males and females.\nThe age range is very broad,\nwhich is great 18 all the way up to 64\nacross the studies that I at.\nOne of the more important things is that\nthe dosages are quite\nhigh 18 grams of Inositol\ntaken for a full month.\nAnd it does take some\ntime for these symptoms\nof anxiety to be improved.\nThe low dose range was\nabout 12 grams of Inositol,\nso as high as 18 as low as 12 grams.\nBut then again, pretty impressive results\nconsidering that these\nare over the counter\nsupplement compounds.\nThere's even some evidence,\nI should just mention\nthat the Inositol is\nalso used for things like\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nWe will do a full episode\non OCD in the future,\nyou can count on that.\nBut in the meantime, Inositol does seem\nto have some positive effects on anxiety.\nAnd therefore it might\nprovide a kind of supportive\nindirect effect for people that are trying\nto work through trauma and PTSD.\nNow, the question is\nwhen would you take it?\nWell, by the logic of\nwhat we spelled out today,\nyou probably would not want\nto take it during a session\nor prior to a session where\nyou were trying to amplify\nthe intensity of an\nexperience and the recounting\nof an experience in efforts to eventually\nextinguish that experience, right?\nBecause if you put a drug\nor a compound of any kind\nprescription drug or\nsupplement or any kind\ninto your system you are\nessentially short-circuiting\nthe extinguishing effect, right?\nSo you could imagine doing\nthis outside of that session\nas a way to kind of bring your system\nback to baseline, perhaps.\nSo if you're going to\nuse these sorts of things\nyou want to think about them logically.\nAnd this also really\npoints to the fact that\nmany of the things that\npeople are doing out there\nto self-medicate over use of alcohol\nor other substances to\ntry and calm themselves\nbecause they have fear, anxiety and PTSD\nare actually driving that\nfear, anxiety and PTSD\ndeeper into their system.\nOr at least is not allowing\nit to relieve itself\nthrough any attempts to recount or replay\nand using these top-down\nnarrative circuits\nor other approaches.\nAnd the last compound I want to mention\nis a particularly interesting one,\nbecause it's neither an anxiolytic,\nnor is it something that increases\noverall levels of stress and alertness.\nBut it has some kind of MDMA\nish light contour to it.\nIt does not produce as far as we know,\nthe same mental effects or\nphysical effects as MDMA\nby any stretch but that's...\nThe substance I'm referring\nto rather is Kava.\nKava has been shown in eight\nstudies to have a very potent\neffect on reducing anxiety.\nBut what's interesting about\nkava is that kava functions\nby increasing GABA,\nthis inhibitory\nneurotransmitter in the brain.\nRemember GABA is the\ninhibitory neurotransmitter\nthat is used, that's\nemployed by the very neurons\nin the prefrontal cortex\nthat serve to inhibit\nthe threat reflex.\nSo it seems to increase GABA,\nbut it also increases Dopamine.\nAnd that's a somewhat unusual compound.\nI'm not aware of many compounds\nthat simultaneously increase\nGABA and increase Dopamine.\nAnd as you recall, that\nthreat reflex has outputs\nthat tap into the Dopamine system.\nNow that's a big leap\nto go from a compound\nthat increases GABA and Dopamine\nand look at a circuit spelled out on paper\nin front of us and say,\n\"Oh, there's GABA and\nDopamine in this circuit\nand therefore this is a\ngood compound to take.\"\nBut the effects of Kava in human studies\nare pretty interesting\nas it relates to anxiety,\nstress, PTSD and fear.\nI'm not going to summarize\nall of these because\nthere are eight studies that I'm aware of.\nBut I'll just mention, again,\nthese are double blind studies.\nSo the trial design is solid.\nThe age ranges are anywhere from 18 to 64\nwhich is a nice broad age range.\nThe number of subjects is\nquite high both men and women.\nNo signs of hepatotoxic signal\nso meaning liver toxicity,\nalthough of course,\ncheck with your doctor.\nBut what was interesting\nis that after a period\nof about three weeks of treatment\nwith anywhere from 150 milligrams\nof what are called active\nkava lactones, okay?\nSo there are dosages\nthat relate to that kava.\nSo a hundred milligrams of extract of Kava\nis a kind of a reasonable\ntypical dose in these studies.\nBut that spells out to a\ncertain amount of Kava lactone.\nSo you have to kind of boil down\nto what is the appropriate dosage.\nAnd it turns out it's extremely broad.\nYou'll see evidence of 50 milligrams,\nyou'll see evidence of 300 milligrams,\nis kind of all over the place.\nBut each of these studies\nalone and together\npoint to the fact that\nKava does seem to produce\na very potent anxiolytic and\ngeneral kind of improvement\nin depressive symptoms and\nreduction in generalized anxiety\nacross the board.\nSo it's an interesting compound.\nI've never actually tried\nany of the compounds\nI just mentioned.\nKava, Saffron or Inositol.\nSo I can't report on them personally.\nI just know that a number\nof listeners of this podcast\nare interested in supplements\nand legal over the counter\napproaches to their biology\nand psychology.\nAnd so that's why I mentioned them.\nThose were the three for which I found\nthe most convincing evidence\nand the largest bulk of evidence.\nSo if you're interested in exploring those\nproceed with caution but they\ndo seem quite interesting.\nSo today we've reviewed a\nlarge amount of information\nabout the biology of pathways\nin the brain and body\nthat underlie the fear response.\nAnd they give rise to chronic fear\nand in some cases to trauma and PTSD.\nWe also touched on a large\nvariety of approaches\nto dealing with fear, trauma and PTSD\nthat currently exist in the\nclinical landscape out there.\nI also touch on some\nof the emerging themes,\nfor instance, this short five minute a day\ndeliberate self-directed\nstress of any kind\nthrough respiration or other approaches\nof increasing Adrenaline.\nAs an approach that might be viable,\nI should emphasize might,\nbe viable for enhancing the speed\nor the potency of\ntreatments to reduce fear\nor eliminate trauma.\nMost important I believe is to understand\nand really think about\nthe logical structure\nof the circuits that\nunderlie fear and PTSD.\nBecause in doing that\neach of us, all of us,\ncan think about what sorts\nof treatments and approaches\nmake the most sense for them.\nI also hope that it will help people\nlean into certain practices\ninvolving re-exposure,\nprovided that's done in\na supportive environment.\nRe-exposure to a given traumatic event\nin an attempt to extinguish that.\nObviously you want to do that safely,\nmeaning psychologically\nsafely and physically safely.\nThere are great practitioners out there\nthat can help you with that work.\nThere are also a number\nof people out there\nI am certain that are\ncarrying certain traumas\nor certain fears that they\nwould like to alleviate\nthat are not in the\nextreme clinical realm.\nAnd that's the reason why I\ntouched on a number of things\nincluding some self-directed practices\nthat might be useful and\nreasonable for them to explore.\nI realize we covered a\nlot of information today.\nIf you're enjoying and are\nlearning from this podcast\nand you're not traumatized\nby the amount of information covered,\nplease

supplements aren't necessary\nand perhaps aren't right for everybody\nmany people derive great\nbenefit from supplements.\nIt is important however,\nthat if you're going to use supplements\nthat they be a very high quality\nand that you can trust that\nthe amounts of supplement\nlisted on the supplement bottle\nare actually what's\ncontained in the bottle.\nThat's a serious issue with a\nlot of supplements out there.\nFor that reason, we partnered\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-E.\nBecause Thorne has the\nhighest levels of stringency\nwith respect to the quality\nof their supplements\nand the amounts of the\nsupplements listed on the bottle\nare actually what's are\ncontained in the bottle.\nThey've partnered with\nall the major sports teams\nas well as the Mayo Clinic.\nSo we have a very high degree\nof trust with Thorne products.\nIf you want to see the Thorne products\nthat I take you can go\nto Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\n.com/u/huberman.\nAnd there you can see the\nsupplements that I take.\nYou can get 20% off any\nof those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site,\nthrough that portal,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing Huberman Lab\non Twitter and Instagram,\nthere I do short neuroscience tutorials.\nI offer a lot of tools\noftentimes that don't overlap\nwith the content of the podcast.\nAnd last but not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[bright music]"
