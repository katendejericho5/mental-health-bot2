    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[bright guitar music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are talking\nabout time perception.\nOur perception of time is\nperhaps the most important factor\nin how we gauge our life,\nthat is whether or not we\nthink we are being successful,\nwhether or not we are failing,\nwhether or not we live in fear,\nwhether or not we live\nin relation to things\nin a way that's positive,\nand the reason for that\nis that our perception of\ntime is directly linked\nto the neurochemical\nstates that control mood,\nstress, happiness, excitement,\nand of course it frames the way\nin which we evaluate our past,\nso whether or not we think of our past\nas successful or unsuccessful.\nIt frames our present,\nwhether or not we think we\nare on track or off track.\nAnd it frames our sense of the future,\nwhether or not we think\nwe have a bright future,\na dim future,\nor whether or not the future\nis very uncertain or not.\nToday, we're going to\ntalk about the science\nof time perception and we\nare going to talk about tools\nand protocols that you can use\nthat can enhance your ability\nto dilate and contract time.\nWhat do we mean by\ndilate and contract time?\nWe can control the speed at\nwhich we experience life.\nWe can slow things down\nor we can speed our experience of life up.\nAnd we can do that in a\nvery direct and dynamic way.\nIt's actually not that hard\nonce you understand how\ntime perception works.\nSo that's where we're headed.\nI think you're going to come\naway from today's episode\nwith a lot of new knowledge\nand certainly with many tools\nthat you can try in your daily life,\nwhether or not that's work, sport,\nrelational, emotional, and so on.\nBefore we begin our discussion\nabout time perception,\nI'd like to answer some\nquestions that I received\nrelated to the episode on fasting\nand time-restricted feeding.\nIf you haven't seen that episode,\nthis information should\nstill be of use to you.\nTime-restricted feeding involves eating\nfor a particular period of time\nin each 24-hour cycle\nthat's fairly regular.\nSo this would be an eight-hour most often\nor a 10-hour block.\nSome people do shorter feeding\nwindows, but regardless,\nthat feeding window is supposed to fall\nat more or less the same\nperiod within each 24-hour day.\nThis has a number of positive\neffects on gene expression\nthat regulate a number of positive effects\non the different tissues of\nthe body, and for some people,\nnot all, but for some people\nmakes weight loss easier\nbecause of the way that\nthey are not eating\nfor large periods of each 24-hour cycle.\nIn any event, one of the\nmajor questions I got\nafter that episode was do\nsupplements break a fast?\nAnd during that episode,\nI talked about what breaks\na fast is highly contextual.\nIt basically boils down\nto whether or not something you ingest,\nwhether it be liquid or food,\nincreases your resting blood glucose,\nhow much it increases that\nresting blood glucose,\nand how long that increase lasts.\nSo you can check out the episode\nfor more about what breaks a fast,\nbut to address this\nissue about supplements\nand whether or not supplements\nin particular break a fast,\nmany of the questions were\nabout Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is a\nsponsor of this podcast.\nIt is also a terrific\nsupplement that I'd been taking\nfor more than a decade\nbefore this podcast launched.\nAnd many people have been using\nand continue to use Athletic Greens.\nDoes Athletic Greens break a fast?\nWell, that will somewhat depend\non whether or not your\nresting blood glucose\ntends to run high or\nlow, but for most people,\nincluding me, because I've measured it,\ningesting Athletic Greens\ndoes not break a fast\nand if it happens to break a fast,\nit would be a very\ntransient break in fast.\nSo without knowing your\nresting blood glucose levels\non an individual basis, there's\nno way I can say for sure\nthat it doesn't break a fast,\nbut chances are it does not\nbecause it doesn't contain\nmuch carbohydrate or sugar\nand it doesn't tend to therefore pull you\nout of the molecular mill you associated\nwith low blood glucose states.\nThe other question I get\nis whether or not things\nlike fish oil break a\nfast, and once again,\nthis will be contextual,\nbut because fish oil is\na fat, an essential fat,\nmainly essential fatty acids,\nin particular EPA and DHA,\nthose don't tend to raise\nblood glucose very much.\nIn my case, having measured\nusing a continuous glucose\nmonitor my resting blood glucose,\nfish oil does not in any way change\nmy resting blood glucose.\nChances are it won't do that\nfor most people as well.\nSo does fish oil break a\nfast? Chances are it does not.\nAnd of course people wanted to know\nabout pill-type supplements, you know,\ncaffeine and things that raise dopamine\nand their vitamins and minerals.\nIn general, if something\ndoesn't contain sugar\nor much carbohydrate of any kind,\nit's not going to raise\nblood glucose very much.\nNow, of course, protein\ncan raise blood glucose\nand fat can too as well,\nalthough to a lesser extent.\nSo again, this is all contextual,\nbut at least by the logic\nthat I just spelled out,\nAthletic Greens, fish oil,\nand most forms of supplements,\nprovided they don't have any\nsugar or protein content,\nshould not quote unquote break a fast.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system\nand one of the key things\nabout our visual system\nis that it's designed so\nthat when you move into areas\nwhere it's sunny or\nwhere there are shadows,\nyou can still see things\nwith crystal clarity.\nMany sunglasses out there have the problem\nthat you have to keep taking them off\nand putting them back on\ndepending on the overall\nso-called ambient environment\nthat you're in.\nROKA sunglasses have solved this problem\nand their eyeglasses\nalso have super clarity\nregardless of overall\nambient lighting, as we say.\nIn other words, you see\neverything very clearly\nno matter where you are.\nThey also come in a number\nof different styles.\nThe aesthetics are really terrific.\nSo unlike a lot of\nperformance glasses out there\nthat make people look like cyborgs,\nyou can wear them anywhere.\nYou can wear them to dinner.\nYou can wear them to school or work\nor in social engagements and\nyou can wear them running\nand cycling and out doing\nyour various activities.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to ROKA that's R-O-K-A, .com\nand enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI started using Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason that I started\nusing Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice every day is that it covers\nall of my foundational needs for vitamins,\nminerals, and probiotics.\nIn fact, when people ask me\nwhat supplements they should take,\nif I were going to recommend\njust one supplement,\nit would be Athletic Greens\nbecause of the enormous number\nof biological factors that\nit impacts in a positive way.\nIt has, as I mentioned,\nvitamins and minerals.\nThe probiotics are really\nimportant for the gut microbiome\nand gut health which is\nimportant for the immune system\nand for brain health and for mood\nand a number of other important factors\nincluding hormones and so on.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim their special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nwhich make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road or in the car.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nVitamin D3 and K2 have been\nshown to be really important\nfor a number of important\naspects of your immediate\nand long-term health\nincluding blood lipid profiles\nand a number of other things.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs,\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test\nand it's for that reason\nthat I get my blood work done\nonce every four to six months.\nMight seem like a lot,\nbut it has been vital\nin order to keep my health where I want it\nand to ensure that my\nhealth trajectory is heading\nin the direction that I'd like it to go\nwith each passing year.\nThe other thing about InsideTracker\nis they have DNA tests\nwhich can tell you about the\nspecific makeup of your genes\nthat can impact your particular nutrition,\nlifestyle, and supplementation regimes.\nThey can also help you\nsteer your immediate\nand long-term health in the\ndirection that you want to go.\nThey make the whole thing very, very easy.\nYou can have the blood test taken at home\nor you can go to a local clinic.\nThen the results come back\nand the wonderful thing is\nthe platform, the dashboard that they use\nwalks you through your data\nand points to specific\nthings related to nutrition.\nMaybe you should be eating\nmore of certain things,\neating less of others, supplementing\nin certain ways or not.\nAnd lifestyle factors like exercise\nin order to bring the\nnumbers into the ranges\nthat are right for your\nimmediate and long-term health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nJust

internal processes,\nyour biology and your psychology,\nare linked to some external thing.\nAnd the most basic form of entrainment\nthat we are all a slave to all year round\nfor our entire life are\nso-called circannual rhythms.\nWe have neurons, nerve cells\nin our eye, in our brain,\nand in our body that are\nmarking off the passage of time\nthroughout the year,\nliterally a calendar system\nin your brain and body.\nAnd the way this works\nis beautifully simple.\nLight seen by your eyes\ninhibits, meaning it reduces,\nthe amount of a hormone released\nin your brain called melatonin.\nMelatonin has two major functions.\nOne function is to make\nyou sleepy at night\nand the other is to regulate\nsome of the other hormones\nof the body, in particular\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nWhen we view light,\nwe reduce the amount\nof melatonin released.\nIn fact, if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night,\nwhen melatonin typically is\npretty high in your brain\nand body and you flip on a\nbright light in the bathroom,\nyour melatonin levels crash down\nto almost zero and stay there.\nLight is a very powerful\nmodulator of melatonin\nand light inhibits melatonin.\nThroughout the year,\ndepending on where you live,\nday length varies, and as a consequence,\nthe amount of light from the sun\nthat is available to you varies.\nSo when days are long,\nthe amount of melatonin\nin your brain and body that's\nreleased tends to be less.\nThere's less of it and it's released\nfor shorter amounts of time, okay?\nBecause light inhibits melatonin.\nWhen days are very short,\nthe amount of melatonin\nthat's released and the duration\nthat that melatonin exists\nin your brain and body\ntends to be much longer.\nSo melatonin correlates with day length.\nAnd if we are viewing more\nlight, we have less melatonin.\nWe view less light, we\nhave more melatonin.\nYou see different\namounts of light each day\nbut we have a process\nin our brain and body\nthat averages the amount\nof light that you're seeing\nboth from artificial\nsources and from sunlight\nand measures that off, and\nit's so exquisitely precise\nthat for a given, say,\neight-hour day in the spring,\n'cause spring in the Northern\nHemisphere or elsewhere,\nyou know, days are getting longer,\nthat means that the amount of melatonin\nis getting progressively less and less\nand that signal is\nconveyed to all the systems\nof your brain and body.\nAnd this is why most people, not all,\nbut most people feel like\nthey have more energy\nin the spring.\nConversely, when you\nhave an eight-hour day\nin the winter, the amount of melatonin\nthat corresponds to that eight-hour day\nis getting progressively\ngreater and greater because why?\nDays are getting shorter\nso melatonin is increasing\nfrom day to day to day.\nEvery cell and system of your\nbody pays attention to this,\nand as a consequence,\nmost people, not all,\nbut most people feel\nthey have a little less\nor sometimes a lot less energy\nand a slightly lower mood\nin the winter months.\nNow, there are exceptions\nto this, of course,\nbut the melatonin signal is the way\nin which your internal state, your mood,\nyour sense of energy, even\nyour appetite is entrained,\nis matched to some external event.\nIn this case, the event is the rotation\nof the Earth around the sun.\nThere are other forms of entrainment,\nmeaning the matching\nof your brain and body\nto things that are happening\nin your external environment.\nOne particularly\ninteresting example of this\nwas published last year by\nParikh et al. in \"Cell Reports,\"\nCell Press journal, excellent journal,\nshowing that across the calendar year,\nthe amount of testosterone and estrogen\nthat human beings make varies\nsuch that in longer days,\nthey tend to make more\ntestosterone and estrogen\nthan in shorter days.\nAnd this was correlated\nwith things like desire\nto seek out romantic partners\nor have romantic interactions\nwith their existing\npartners, even aggression,\nalthough not violent aggression,\nbut sense of kind of willingness to argue\nand to get into kind of combative states\nand overall energy and mood.\nThis is something that had been\nhypothesized for a long time\nbut it had never really\nbeen cleanly demonstrated.\nAnd what they showed was\nthat it's actually the skin\nthat's taking information\nabout the amount of light\nand converting it into these increases\nin testosterone and estrogen.\nLight exposure to the skin,\nturns out about two hours a day,\nthis was sunlight, in this\ncase, to the upper body,\nthese people weren't naked,\nthey were wearing clothes\nbut their arms were exposed,\ntheir upper back and neck\nand face were exposed,\nthey were not wearing hats,\nresulted in large increases,\nsignificant increases in\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nNow you could probably export\na tool from that if you liked.\nThat's not really what\nthis podcast is about\nbut it's very clear that\nbecause the skin is acting\nas an endocrine orman, organ, excuse me,\nas kind of a hormone-influencing organ,\nthat getting light on the\nskin, not just to the eyes,\ncan influence our sense of wellbeing\nby these hormone pathways,\nand the threshold there again\nseemed to be about two hours a day.\nIt doesn't have to be very bright outside.\nThere can be cloud cover and so on.\nMany people will probably ask\nwill sunscreen inhibit this effect?\nAnd it doesn't appear that it does.\nObviously prioritize skin\nhealth and avoiding skin cancer.\nSunscreen is kind of a\ncontroversial topic nowadays,\nmaybe the topic for another\npodcast episode at some point,\nbut nonetheless, what the\nParikh et al. study shows\nand that's most relevant\nto today's podcast\nis that we are entrained, we are matched\nto the external light-dark cycle\nand as the day length\nchanges, our hormones change.\nAnd we can override that with\nexposure to bright lights.\nYou know, people go sit on tanning beds.\nThat's not a practice I\nparticularly myself engage in,\nbut, you know, there are\na number of different ways\nthat people can override these processes.\nBut the point is very simple.\nThe point is that our perception\nof time is both conscious,\nyou know, it's waiting,\nwatching the clock tick down,\nand there are these slower,\nwhat we call oscillatory,\nmeaning up and down repeatedly,\nslower oscillatory events\nrelated to day length that\nare influencing our hormones\nlike melatonin,\ntestosterone, and estrogen,\nand therefore our mood, our\noutlook, and even our behavior.\nThe next level of time or\nbin of time, as we say,\nthat we are all entrained or matched to\nis the so-called circadian time cycle,\nwhich is 24-hour rhythm.\nThis is perhaps the most powerful rhythm\nthat we all contain and that\nnone of us can escape from.\nWe all have this circadian clock\nthat resides over the roof of our mouth.\nThe cells in that circadian clock fire,\nmeaning they release chemicals\ninto our brain and body\non a very regular rhythm.\nSo across the 24-hour cycle,\nthey will be very active at some periods\nand less active at others.\nNot surprisingly, there are\nperiods of every 24-hour cycle\nwhen we are very active\nand we tend to be alert\nand others when we are asleep.\nNow, I've talked a lot\nabout circadian rhythms\nand sleep on this podcast previously\nand so I don't want to repeat\ntoo much of that information\nin detail, but I'm just\ngoing to give a summary\nof how circadian entrainment works\nbecause I haven't really covered that\nin the context of time perception.\nWe have the circadian\nclock. It oscillates.\nIt goes up and down once every\n24 hours and then repeats.\nEvery cell of our body\nhas a 24-hour oscillation\nin the expression of various genes.\nHow that works is actually really simple,\nelegant, and interesting.\nDNA, genes, make RNA. RNA\nis converted into proteins.\nEvery cell in our body has\nthis beautiful 24-hour timer\nwhere a gene is expressed.\nAnd the important thing to\nunderstand about a given gene\nin this context is that\nthat gene is inhibited,\nmeaning it's reduced,\nby a particular protein,\nby a little biological\nmolecule in that cell.\nSo the gene gets expressed\nwhen there's very little\nof that other molecule around.\nDNA then becomes RNA.\nRNA is translated into a protein\nand that protein goes way, way\nup and the gene shuts down.\nBut as that protein gets used up\nand its levels eventually\ndrop low, low, low, low, low\nto zero, the gene cycle kicks in again\nand the gene gets expressed.\nThe RNA gets expressed\nin the protein again.\nThis all happens on a 24-hour cycle.\nSo it's a little built-in timer\nin each and every one of our cells.\nAnd I didn't list off the genes,\nbut for the aficionados out there,\nthey go by names like\nPER for period, BMAL,\nCLOCK, and all these different things.\nWe call them the clock genes\nand those clock genes regulate\na number of different functions.\nSo every cell in our\nbody has a 24-hour cycle\nof gene and protein expression\nand the Earth rotates once every 24 hours\nand the processes that are happening\nin every cell of our body are linked.\nThey are entrained, as we say,\nto the outside light-dark cycle\nbecause morning sunlight,\nevening sunlight,\nand the lack of light in\nthe middle of the night\nmake sure that the changes,\nthese oscillations that are occurring\nwithin the cells of our\nbrain and body are matched\nto the outside light-dark cycle.\nDon't want to go into all the\ndetails of how that happens\nbut there's some very simple\ntools that one can use\nto ensure that your entrainment,\nyour circadian entrainment, is precise.\nAnd I cannot emphasize\nenough how important it is\nthat your circadian\nentrainment be precise, why?\nBecause disruptions in\ncircadian entrainment\ncause huge health problems.\nThey increase cancer risk.\nThey increase obesity.\nThey increase mental health issues.\nThey decrease wound healing.\nThey decrease physical\nand mental performance.\nThey disrupt hormones.\nYou want your cells to be\nlinked to the circadian cycle\nthat's outside you and the\ncircadian cycle outside you\nmainly consists of when there's sunlight\nand when there is not.\nAnd that's why the simple protocols\nto fall out of this whole discussion\nabout circadian entrainment\nare the following.\nView 10 to 30 minutes of bright light,\nideally sunlight, within an hour of waking\nassuming that you're waking\nearly in the day especially.\nYou wake up early in the day,\nget outside, see sunlight.\nDo that again in the\nafternoon or around evening,\n10 to 30 minutes, depending\non how bright it is outside.\nArtificial lights throughout the day,\nor if you want to be awake\nand you wake up early\nand there's no sunlight outside,\nyou can of course turn\non artificial lights\nif you want to be awake\nbut basically you want\nas much bright light,\nideally from sunlight,\ncoming in through your\neyes throughout the day.\nAnd then in the evening,\nyou want as little bright light\ncoming in through your eyes.\nI've said this over and over\nand over again on this podcast.\nThere's always a lot of negotiations,\nbut I want to make a few things clear.\nTry not to wear sunglasses\nif you can do it safely.\nFine to wear eye glasses or contacts.\nThat's not going be a problem.\nThe light viewing that you\ndo and the avoidance of light\nat night set the fundamental\nlayer of your time perception.\nOne of the best ways to\ndisrupt your perception of time\nin the ways that we're going to talk about\nin the subsequent portions of the podcast\nis to disrupt your circadian clock\nand that is not a good thing\nfor a number of different reasons.\nThere are other ways\nto so-called entrain your circadian clock.\nOne of the best ways\nto do that is to engage\nin physical activity at\nfairly regular times of day.\nYou don't have to do it every day\nbut if you're going to exercise,\ntry and exercise at a fairly\nconsistent time of day.\nProbably better to exercise\nthan to not exercise,\neven if you have to move that time of day,\nbut light activity and,\nwe'll talk about the third\nin a minute, food, are the major ways\nthat you entrain your\ninternal perception of time\nto the external events of the world,\nmeaning the turning of the Earth\nand therefore the exposure\nto sunlight or not.\nSo in addition to sunlight\nviewing in the morning\nand throughout the day\nand avoiding bright light\nat night of any kind, not just blue light,\ntrying to get your activity,\nyour exercise at fairly regular,\nwithin plus or minus two hours,\nfrom each day to the next\nis going to have a very positive effect\non so-called circadian entrainment,\nand also eating at fairly regular times.\nHowever, this is exciting.\nThe data mainly point to the\nfact that you need to eat\nwithin more or less the\nsame time window each day,\nnot that you always need to eat your meals\nat exactly the same time.\nSo you don't necessarily\nhave to eat lunch at noon\nand a snack at four and dinner at eight\nin order to keep your\ncircadian entrainment\naligned or sharp.\nYou could for instance\nhave a small snack at noon\nand then eat at two and\nthen have dinner at six\nand then a small snack at eight.\nIt doesn't so much matter\nwhen the exact meals fall\nso much as that they fall more or less\nwithin a consistent period or\nphase of each 24-hour cycle.\nWhat happens when this circadian clock\nstarts getting disrupted?\nI mean, this is after all an\nepisode about time perception.\nIt's not an episode about\ncircadian rhythms and entrainment.\nWell, there's a classic\nstudy by Aschoff done in 1985\nthat's now been repeated many times\nwhere they had people go into environments\nwhere they didn't have clocks\nand they didn't have windows\nand they didn't have watches\nand they were sometimes\neven in constant dark\nor constant light, and they evaluated\nhow well people perceive\nthe passage of time\non shorter timescales\nand what they found\nwas really interesting.\nWhat they found is that\npeople underestimate\nhow long they were in these\nisolated environments.\nSo after 42 days or so, they'd ask people\nhow long do you think you've been in here?\nAnd people would say 28 days or 36 days.\nThey generally underestimated\nhow long they had been\nin this very odd\nenvironment with no clocks\nor watches or exposure to sunlight\nor regular rhythms of artificial light.\nIn addition, they found\nthat their perception\nof shorter time intervals\nwas also really disrupted.\nSo if they ask them to\nmeasure off two minutes,\nnormally people are pretty good\nat measuring off two minutes.\nPeople come within, you know,\n5 to 15 seconds at most.\nIf you'd kind of have to\nsit there and just wait,\nyou have a pretty good idea\nof when two minutes is up.\nYou say two minutes is up.\nWell, when people's circadian clocks\nor circadian entrainment, I\nshould say, was disrupted,\ntheir perception of time\nmeasurement on shorter timescales\nof minutes or even seconds\nwas greatly disrupted.\nAnd as we'll see in a couple of minutes,\nthat actually causes great problems\nfor how you contend with work,\nhow you contend with\nchallenges of different kinds.\nYou want your circadian\nentrainment to be pretty locked in\nor pretty entrained to the\noutside light-dark cycle\nso that your perception of time\non shorter time intervals can be precise\nbecause the ability to\nperceive time accurately\nfor the given task or given thing\nthat you're involved in turns out\nto be one of the most\nfundamental ways that predicts\nhow well or poorly you\nperform that thing or task.\nSo we've talked about\ncircannual entrainment,\nthe matching of the cells and\ntissues and organs of our body\nto the 365-day journey\nthat the Earth takes\naround the sun each year\nand we talked about circadian entrainment,\nthe way that the 24-hour\ngenetic and protein clocks\nof each and every one\nof our cells is matched\nto the rotation of the Earth on its axis\nand the exposure or lack\nof exposure to the sun\nbecause of that rotation on its axis.\nNext I'd like to talk about\nso-called ultradian entrainment.\nUltradian rhythms are rhythms\nof about 90 minutes or so\nand all of our existence is broken up\ninto these 90-minute ultradian cycles.\nWhen you go to sleep at night,\nwhether or not you sleep\nsix hours or four hours\nor eight hours or 10 hours,\nthat entire period of sleep is broken up\ninto these 90-minute ultradian cycles.\nEarly in the night, you tend\nto have more slow-wave sleep.\nLater in the night, you\ntend to have more REM sleep.\nBut nonetheless, your sleep is broken up\ninto these 90-minute cycles.\nHowever, when you wake up in the morning,\nmany of the things that\nyou do are governed\nby these ultradian rhythms.\nFor instance, if you were to work,\nmeaning do math or try\nand learn a language\nor do physical work of\nany kind or work out,\nthe 90-minute time block\nseems to be the one\nin which the brain can\nenter a state of focus\nand alertness and do hard\nwork and focus, focus, focus\nand then at about 90 minutes,\nthere's a significant drop\nin your ability to engage in\nthis mental or physical work.\nNow, everybody from, you\nknow, the self-help literature\nto the business literature to\nthe pop psychology literature\nhas tried to leverage\nthese ultradian cycles\nby saying if you're going\nto do something hard\nand you want to focus on it,\nlimit it to 90 minutes or less.\nAnd I am one of those people\nwho's also joined that conversation\nand indeed I use 90-minute work cycles,\nand I think they are extremely powerful.\nOne should never expect\nthat you're going to drop immediately\ninto a state of high\nfocus at the beginning\nand then remain there for 90 minutes.\nWe all struggle to varying\ndegrees to achieve focus\nand motivation and drive\nwithin those 90-minute cycles.\nBut it is true, meaning\nthere is ample literature\nto support the idea that\nafter about 90 minutes,\nwe tend to go into a state\nof less ability to focus.\nSo while this isn't\ntime perception per se,\nit is again an example of entrainment.\nWhat are we entraining to, right?\nJust because we can focus for 90 minutes\nand then not so well at\n100 minutes or 120 minutes,\nwhat are we entraining to?\nWell, what you're\nentraining to is the release\nof particular neurochemicals,\nin this case, acetylcholine and dopamine\nthat allow your brain to focus\nfor particular periods of\ntime, 90 minutes or so,\nand after about 90 minutes or so,\nthe amount of those chemicals\nthat can be released\ntends to drop very low,\nwhich is why your ability\nto focus becomes diminished.\nIf one would like to explore\nmore about the kind of backbone\nand basis of these ultradian rhythms,\nit goes by a different name.\nThis was originally called\nthe basic rest-activity cycle.\nThis was proposed many years\nago by Nathaniel Kleitman.\nIt was established to be true\nwithin sleep states as I mentioned before.\nThen it was debated for a long time\nwhether or not these\n90-minute cycles also control\nour ability to focus and\nperform work in wakeful states\nand it turns out that they do.\nNow there's a lot of\nliterature to support that.\nI always get the question how do you know\nwhen the 90 minute cycle begins?\nIn other words, let's\nsay you wake up at 8 AM\nand you just finished a\n90-minute sleep cycle.\nDoes that mean that your\nnext 90-minute cycle\nwhere you could do work\nbegins right at 8:01?\nNo, the interesting thing\nabout these basic rest-activity cycles,\nthese ultradian rhythms,\nis that you can initiate\nthem whenever you want.\nThis is not like a circadian rhythm\nwhich is a hardwired\nunerring signal of 24 hours.\nThe ultradian rhythms that occur\nduring sleep are hardwired, unerring.\nYou don't get the option\nof making your sleep cycles\n120 minutes or five minutes.\nYou don't get that option.\nBut if you decide that you\nwant to apply ultradian rhythms\nto work and performance,\nyou can set a clock\nand decide, okay, now the focus begins.\nNow the work begins and this\n90-minute cycle is the period\nin which I'm going to do work.\nAnd I actually do this, you know,\nmid morning and sometimes twice a day,\nI do a 90-minute cycle where\nI limit all distraction\nas much as possible, put away my phone,\noften turn off the internet as well.\nI talked about this in an episode\non kind of an optimal\nworkday, at least for me,\njust to give an example\nof how this might work.\nBut I want to emphasize again\nthat these ultradian rhythms\nare ones that you set.\nSo you decide I'm going\nto work for 90 minutes.\nWhat you can't negotiate, however,\nis that at about 100\nminutes or 120 minutes,\nno matter who you are,\nyou're going to see a\ndiminishment in performance.\nYou're not going to focus as well.\nAnd that's again because of the way\nthat these 90-minute cycles\nare linked to the ability\nof the neurons that release\nacetylcholine and dopamine\nand to some extent norepinephrine,\nthe things that give us narrow focus,\nmotivation, and drive, the way\nthat these 90-minute cycles\nare involved in those circuits.\nAfter about 90 minutes,\nthose circuits are far\nless willing to engage\nand therefore it's much harder to continue\nto focus to a high degree.\nSome people like to do\nmultiple 90-minute cycles\nper day of focus.\nIn that case, you need\nto separate them out.\nYou can't do one 90-minute cycle,\nthen go right into\nanother 90-minute cycle,\nthen another 90-minutes cycle.\nYou can't cheat these circuits\nrelated to acetylcholine\nand dopamine and\nnorepinephrine unfortunately.\nI suggest that people\ndo no more than three\nand ideally it would be two\nor just one of these 90-minute cycles.\nWhy did I say ideally?\nWell, they are very taxing.\nYou are in a very narrow tunnel of focus.\nSo for me, I can do one mid morning.\nI can probably do another\none in the afternoon.\nThis is not the kind of work\nthat's like checking email\nor text messaging or social media.\nThis is very focused hard work,\nworking on hard problems of various kinds,\nand this will be different for everybody.\nSo I recommend that they be spaced\nby at least two to four hours\nand most people probably won't be able\nto handle more than two per day.\nThere are probably some mutants out there\nthat could do three or four,\nbut that's exceedingly rare.\nI think even one a day is going to feel\nlike a significant mental investment,\nand afterwards you're\ngoing to feel pretty taxed.\nSo now we've talked about circannual,\ncircadian, and ultradian rhythms,\nbut we haven't really talked\nabout time perception per se.\nWe've mainly talked\nabout the subconscious\nslow oscillatory ways\nin which we are entrained\nor matched to the year\nor to the day and these ultradian cycles\nthat we can impose on our work\nand that we can leverage\ntoward more focus if we like.\nBut what about the actual\nperception of time?\nWhat actually controls how fast\nor how slowly we perceive time going by?\nThere are basically three\nforms of time perception\nthat we should all be aware of.\nOne is our perception of the\npassage of time in the present,\nhow quickly or slowly things\nseem to be happening for us.\nThis is kind of like an\ninterval timer ticking off time.\nTick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.\nIt's either fine-slicing like that,\nor tick, tick, tick.\nWe have interval timers.\nI'll discuss the basis\nof those interval timers.\nWe also engage in what's\ncalled prospective timing\nwhich is like a stopwatch\nmeasuring off things\nas they go forward.\nThat might sound a little bit\nlike what I just described\nbut it's actually a little bit different.\nFor instance, if I told\nyou to start measuring off\na two-minute time\ninterval into the future,\nyou could do that pretty well.\nBut if I told you you had to measure\na five-minute time\ninterval into the future\nand you couldn't use any clocks or watches\nor your phone or anything like that,\nyou would have to set the tick marks.\nYou'd have to decide how many\ntimes you were going to count off\nduring that five-minute time block.\nThere's also retrospective time\nwhich is how you measure\noff time in the past.\nSo if I say, you know, last week,\nI know you went to the park,\nyou did some things\nwith friends, you know,\nyou went out in the evening.\nHow long was it between lunch\nand when you went to dinner with friends?\nYou'd probably think, okay, well,\nI remember I went to dinner at seven\nand we had lunch right around two.\nYou're using memory to\nreconstruct certain sets of events\nin the past and get a sense\nof their relative positioning\nwithin time, okay?\nSo we have retrospective,\ncurrent time interval measurements,\nand then prospective time\nmeasurement into the future.\nThe beauty of time perception\nin the human nervous system\nis that it boils down to a\ncouple of simple molecules\nthat govern whether or not\nwe are fine-slicing time\nor whether or not we are\nbatching time in larger bins.\nThose molecules go by names\nthat maybe you've heard,\nthings like dopamine and norepinephrine,\nneuromodulators, called neuromodulators\nbecause they modulate, they change the way\nthat other neural circuits work.\nAlso things like serotonin.\nSerotonin is released\nfrom a different site\nin the brain than\ndopamine or epinephrin is\nand has a different\neffect on time perception.\nSo just to give you an example\nof how things like dopamine\nand serotonin can modulate\nour perception of time,\nwant to focus on a\nlittle bit of literature\nthat now has been done\nfortunately in animals and humans\nand which essentially shows\nthat the more dopamine\nthat's released into our brain,\nthe more we tend to\noverestimate the amount of time\nthat has just passed.\nLet me repeat that.\nThe more dopamine that is\nreleased into our brain,\nthe more we tend to overestimate\nhow much time has passed.\nThese experiments are very\nstraight, straightforward,\nexcuse me, and they're very\nobjective, which is really nice,\nwhich is you can give\npeople or an animal a drug\nthat increases the amount of dopamine\nand then ask them to measure off\nwithout any measurement\ndevice like a watch or a clock\nwhen one minute has passed.\nAs dopamine levels rise in the brain,\npeople tend to think that the\nminute is up before a minute.\nSo they, at the 38-second\nmark, they'll say,\nokay, I think a minute is up.\nSo they've overestimated how\nmuch time has passed, okay?\nThe higher the level of dopamine,\nthe more people tend to overestimate.\nNow, it's also true that norepinephrine,\nalso called noradrenaline, plays a role\nand its role is very\nsimilar to that of dopamine\nand that's because norepinephrine\nand dopamine are close cousins,\nas some of you may recall\nthat they are actually manufactured\nfrom one another, okay?\nSo dopamine can actually make epinephrin\nand norepinephrine biochemically.\nThere's a cascade in\nwhich dopamine can be made\ninto norepinephrine and\nepinephrin, which is remarkable.\nHow does having elevated\nlevels of dopamine\nand norepinephrine cause\none to overestimate\nhow much time has passed?\nWell, it does it because of the way\nthat it causes fine-slicing\nof your time bins.\nSo fine-slicing of time bins\nis like increasing the frame\nrate on your camera, right?\nSlow motion is achieved in movies\nand elsewhere by\nincreasing the frame rate.\nSo if you take a movie at 30\nframes per second and watch it,\nit will appear to have\na certain speed, right?\n'Cause those are just\nsnapshots, 30 frames per second.\nIn contrast, if you took that same movie\nat 4,000 frames per second,\nyou are fine-slicing\nand you're going to\nsee every little detail\nand as you play each one of those frames,\nit's going to look like\nit moved slower, okay?\nWhatever, so the kind of\njump shot in basketball\nthat's done slowly, any slow motion\nis the consequence of higher frame rate.\nSo dopamine and norepinephrine\nincrease frame rate,\nand as a consequence, they tend to lead us\nto overestimate the amount\nof time that's passed.\nConversely, the neuromodulator\nserotonin causes people\nto underestimate the amount\nof time that's passed.\nSo they've done these experiments.\nThey actually have done\nthese experiments using,\nin humans, with drugs\nthat increase serotonin.\nThey've also done them with cannabis\nwhich increases serotonin\namong other things\nincluding the cannabinoid\nreceptor activation.\nAnd when people have\nelevated levels of 5-HT\nor whether or not they've\ningested cannabis,\nthey tend to underestimate\nhow much time has passed.\nYou do the equivalent experiment.\nYou tell people that they have to guess\nor tell you when five minutes,\nfor instance, has passed.\nJust use five minutes\nas an example this time.\nAnd generally they will\nmiss the five-minute mark.\nThey will think, they'll\nlet six minutes pass\nand they'll think it was five minutes\nwhen they've underestimated\nhow much time has passed.\nAnd that's because serotonin\nand some of the related\nmolecules in the brain\ntend to lead to slower frame rates, right?\nThey take the frame rate in\nthe example I used before\nfrom 4,000 frames per second down\nto, say, 20 frames per second.\nSo this is very interesting.\nIt's interesting in terms of\nhow pharmacology can be used\nto adjust time perception\nbut it's also interesting\nin the context of that circadian rhythm.\nThere's some emerging evidence\nthat throughout the 24-hour cycle,\nthere are robust changes\nin the amount of dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, and\nserotonin that are present\nin the brain and bloodstream and body\ndepending on time of day\nwithin the circadian cycle.\nNow, I'm not talking about during sleep.\nDuring sleep, there are\ndefinitely variations\nin things like dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, and serotonin.\nI talked about that in\nthe episodes on sleep.\nHere I'm just talking about\nthe role of these molecules\nin time perception during wakefulness.\nSo much of the evidence points to the fact\nthat in the first half of the day,\napproximate first half of the day,\ndopamine and norepinephrine\nare elevated in the brain,\nbody, and bloodstream much\nmore than is serotonin\nand that in the second half of the day\nand in particular towards\nevening and nighttime,\nserotonin levels are going up.\nI think that's fairly\nwell-established now.\nWhat that means based on\nwhat we just discussed\nabout the role of dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, and serotonin\nin setting the frame\nrate of time perception\nis that our perception\nof the passage of time\nwill be very different in\nthe early part of the day\nand in the latter half of the day.\nAnd there's starting to be some evidence\nto support this, that early in the day,\npeople tend to overestimate\nhow much time has passed\nand later in the day,\nthey tend to underestimate\nhow much time has passed.\nAnd this is independent of\ntaking any kind of substance\nthat would increase or\ndecrease dopamine or serotonin.\nNow, this is important in terms\nof how one thinks about\nstructuring their day,\nbecause I know many people are thinking\nabout the various tasks\nthat they need to do\nthroughout their day.\nMany, or I should say\nall of the literature,\nat least that I can find on productivity\nand things of that sort point to the idea\nthat we should be doing the hardest task,\nthe thing that we want to do the least\nor the most important\ntask early in the day\nas a kind of a psychological\ntool for getting it done\nand feeling as if we\naccomplished something\nand I think that's an\nexcellent protocol, frankly,\nbut I'm not sure it's\nan excellent protocol\nbecause of the way that\nwe sense accomplishment\nor at least it's not only\nan excellent protocol\nbecause of the way that\nwe sense accomplishment.\nAnother reason to move\nsomething that's very hard\ninto the early part of the day\nis that if indeed the dopaminergic\nand noradrenergic circuits\nare more active at that time,\nwe are actually in a\nbetter position cognitively\nto parse that hard\nproblem because of the way\nthat we are able to fine-slice\nour perception of time\nand fine-slice all the\nperceptual events outside us.\nSo what I'm really saying\nis that early in the day,\nyou are a much more\nhigh resolution camera,\nso to speak, than you\nare later in the day.\nNow, different types of tasks\nand different types of things\nrequire different frame rates\nor different ways of perceiving time,\nand indeed, this also\nlends itself to a tool\nwhereby for activities that involve\nmore kind of creative thinking\nthat aren't as constrained\nby particular answers or outcomes\nand in which we need to kind\nof blend different aspects\nof our memory, different\naspects of task utilization,\nin other words, for creative\nworks, for brainstorming,\nfor things that are a bit\nmore fluid, so to speak,\nthe more serotonergic\nsecond half of the day,\nand because of the way the\nserotonergic second half\nof the day lends itself\nto our time perception,\nmay actually be more beneficial\nfor those sorts of tasks.\nAnd I'll put a reference\nto a couple of the studies\nthat point to this idea\nthat in these higher dopaminergic states,\nwe are better at doing\ncertain sorts of tasks\nand in these more serotonergic states,\nwe're better at doing other sorts of tasks\nand how the dopamine tends\nto be earlier in the day\nand the serotonin later\nin the day, so to speak.\nThese are broad, I'm painting\nwith broad strokes here,\nbut I think these lend themselves\nto some really excellent tools\nbecause I think we all\nunderstand the value\nof doing something that's hard\nor challenging early in the day,\nbut we should ask ourselves\nhard or challenging how?\nWhat does that task\nactually really require\nin terms of time perception?\nSome people might appreciate some examples\nof how this might work.\nBasically what I'm saying\nis if you are doing work\nthat involves adhering\nto some rigid rules,\nso math or a recipe or\nexecution of musical scales\nor physical skills or accounting\nor something that requires\na lot of precision\nwhere there's a right and\nwrong answer and it's hard,\nI would suggest that you do that\nin the early part of the\nday because of the way\nthat dopamine and norepinephrine\nimpact time perception.\nYou are literally better\nat slicing up time,\nyou are a higher resolution\nbrain during those times,\nand so that's going to lend\nitself better to events\nand demands that require high resolution,\nwhereas in the afternoon\nin this more what I'm\ncalling serotonergic state,\nthat's when you're going to\nbe better at brainstorming\nand creative works where\nthere's some flexibility\nin terms of how you're batching\ntime and perceiving time\nand there isn't so much rigid oversight\nof a right or wrong answer.\nAnd as an aside to support what I said\nbut also to take us back\nto this critical role\nof the circadian rhythm,\nthere is a lot of evidence\nthat when one's sleep is disrupted,\nwhen sleep is either too\nshort or is fragmented\nor is not of high enough\nquality for enough days,\none of the first things to happen\nis that there is a dysregulation\nof these dopaminergic, noradrenergic,\nand serotonergic states\nthroughout the day.\nThey get kind of mish-mashed up.\nIt's not that they're a total mess\nbut they aren't as cleanly defined.\nAnd I think this is one of the reasons why\nwhen we haven't slept well\nor we haven't slept enough,\nwe tend to feel a little off,\nlike we can't concentrate.\nPart of that lack of concentration\nis due to other things\nbut part of that concentration\ncould be due to the fact\nthat our sense of the\npassage of time is disrupted.\nSo there seems to be some value in keeping\nthe dopaminergic noradrenergic\nstate kind of limited\nto the early part of the day\nand this serotonergic\nstate, as we're calling it,\nkind of pushed towards the\nsecond half of the day.\nNow, there is a version of how\ndopamine and norepinephrine\ncan impact our perception\nof the passage of time\nin ways that can be very\ndisruptive or even maladaptive\nand the best example that\nI'm aware of is trauma.\nMany people who have been in car accidents\nor who have experienced some\nother form of major trauma\ndo what's called overclocking.\nOverclocking is when levels\nof dopamine and norepinephrine\nincrease so much during\na particular event,\nour level of alertness\nis increased so much\nduring a given event that we fine-slice.\nIn other words, the frame\nrate is increased so much so\nthat we perceive things as\nhappening in ultra slow motion.\nNow, that might not seem\nlike a bad thing overall\nbut the problem with\noverclocking is the way\nin which that information\ngets stamped down\ninto the memory system.\nSo the memory system, which\ninvolves areas of the brain\nlike the hippocampus\nbut also the neocortex,\nis basically a space-time recorder.\nWhat do I mean by space-time recorder?\nWell, your nervous system, of course,\nis housed in the darkness of your skull.\nIt doesn't have a whole lot of information\nabout the outside world\nexcept light coming in\nthrough the eyes and whatever\nhappens to hit our ears\nin terms of sound waves\nand skin and so forth\nso it has to take all those neural signals\nand it has to create a\nrecord of what happened.\nNow, it doesn't create a record\nof everything that happened\nbut car accidents and trauma\nand things of that sort\noftentimes are stamped down\ninto our record of what happened.\nAnd what gets stamped down,\nwhat we actually mean by\nthe phrase stamped down\nis that the precise firing\nof the sequence of neurons\nthat reflected some events,\nso let's say I'm in a car accident,\ncertain neurons are firing\nbecause of the flipping\nof the car or their\nscreams or there's blood,\nor, you know, things of that sort,\nall of that neural activity gets repeated\nin the hippocampus and then the sequence\nof the firing of those\nneurons is also remembered.\nSo it's not just that\nneuron one, two, three, four\nfired in that sequence.\nIt's also that neuron\none, two, three, four\nfired at a particular rate.\nSo it would be one, two, three, four\nduring the actual event and\nthen the memory is stored\nas firing of those neurons as\none, two, three, four, right?\nIf during the event, it\nwas one, two, three, four\nat that rate, the storage of the memory\nis not going to be one,\ntwo, three, four, okay?\nIn other words, there's both\na space code, as we say,\nmeaning the particular neurons\nthat fire is important,\nand there's a rate code, how\nquickly those neurons fire\nor the relative firing,\nthe timing of the firing\nof those neurons is\nalso part of the memory.\nThis affords our memory\nsystem tremendous flexibility.\nWhat it means is that you can\ntake the same set of neurons\nin the hippocampus and stamp\ndown many, many more memories\nbecause all you have to do is use a match\nof the different rates\nof the different neurons\nthat were firing in order\nto set that code, right?\nOtherwise, if you needed\na different set of neurons\nfor every memory, you'd need\nan enormous hippocampus.\nYou'd need an enormous head.\nSo I think you get the basic idea.\nOverclocking is a case in\nwhich the frame rate is so high\nthat a memory gets stamped down\nand people have a very hard\ntime shaking that memory\nand the emotions associated\nwith that memory.\nAnd it's not the topic\nof today's conversation\nbut we will cover trauma in\na future episode in detail,\nbut many of the treatments for trauma,\nEMDR, nowadays there's\na lot of excitement also\nabout ketamine therapies,\nexposure therapies,\nyou know, like cognitive\nbehavioral therapies\ninvolve not just trying to\nreduce the amount of emotion\nassociated with a memory, but\nalso a deliberate speeding up\nor slowing down of that memory.\nIn other words, trying to allow the person\nwho experienced the trauma to take control\nof the rate of the\nexperience in their memory,\nnot just whether or not\nthe memory happened at all.\nIn fact, you know, one of the first things\nthat trauma victims learn\nis that they aren't going\nto forget what happened.\nWhat's eventually going to happen ideally\nwith good treatment is\nthat the emotional weight\nof the experience will\neventually be divorced\nfrom the memory of the experience.\nAnd that's done again by trying to reduce\nthe amount of emotional activation\nduring the recall of that experience\nand one of the best ways to do that\nis to alter the rate\nof the memory playback.\nIn other words, taking\nthat firing of neurons\nthat might've been one, two, three, four,\nagain, it would be much more complicated,\nbut one, two, three,\nfour for the car crash\nand getting the memory\nto play back at a rate\nof one, two, three, four,\nor even one, two, three, four,\none, two, three, four.\nIn other words, allowing the person\nor instructing the person to take control\nof the rate of the\nplayback, and in that way,\nthere seems to be still\nyet unknown mechanism\nby which people can uncouple\nsome of the emotional weight\nthat's associated with that memory.\nSo overclocking is a\nkind of extreme example\nof where the dopaminergic\nand the neurogenetic system\nis ramped up so high\nthat people have this,\nunfortunately, what\nseems like indelible mark\nin their brain of a particular event.\nBut again, trauma treatment is designed\nto uncouple the emotional\nload of that event.\nSome of you are probably saying\nwhy dopamine during trauma?\nI thought dopamine was\nthe feel-good molecule.\nWell, in reality,\ndopamine is not necessarily\na molecule of reward.\nIt's a molecule of motivation,\npursuit, and drive.\nAnd because of the close relationship\nbetween dopamine and norepinephrine,\noftentimes they are co-released.\nSo whether or not dopamine is\nreleased during car crashes\nor other forms of trauma, we don't know\nbut what we do know is that\nboth the dopamine system\nand noradrenergic system,\nwhen we say noradrenergic,\nwe mean norepinephrine, those\nsystems are greatly increased\nanytime there's a\nheightened state of arousal.\nAnd arousal can have negative valence,\nlike meaning associated with\nan event that we really hate,\nthat we would prefer\nnot to be involved in,\nor can positive valence, but\ndopamine and norepinephrine\nare kind of the common hallmark\nof all things of elevated arousal.\nAnd so that's why we see\nevidence for dopamine\nbeing associated with these\nchanges in time perception\nboth for positive events\nand for negative events.\nThere's a very interesting\nrelationship between arousal,\ndopamine, time perception, and blinking,\nand this is all supported by\na really interesting paper,\nfirst author, Terhune is the\nlast name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.\nIt's published in \"Current Biology.\"\nCell Press journal. Excellent journal.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking.\"\nSo heightened states of\narousal are associated\nwith heightened levels of dopamine.\nYou now know that dopamine leads\nto a kind of fine-slicing of time\nand one of the ways that we\nfine-slice time is by blinking.\nYou know, we think of\nblinking as just a thing\nto lubricate our eyes or to limit\nthe amount of light coming into our eyes,\nbut it's a shutter on our experience.\nSo much of the information\ncoming into the brain\nthrough our eyes impacts our attention.\nI've said it before on this podcast,\nthat cognitive attention\nfollows visual attention,\nat least for sighted individuals.\nWell, it turns out that dopamine\nand increases in dopamine are associated\nwith increases in spontaneous blink rate.\nSo the more aroused we\nare, the more awake we are,\nthere are a number of effects.\nPupils dilate, heart rate\nincreases, et cetera,\nbut also blink rate increases.\nAnd every time we blink,\nthis study cleanly shows,\nwe shift our perception\nof time, leading to,\nas I mentioned before,\noverestimations of time.\nSo it seems as though in some way,\nblink rate is actually\nrelated to frame rate.\nSo this is very, very interesting\nand the way that you could\nthink about leveraging this\nwould be if you wanted\nto actually slow down\nyour perception of time,\nyou would blink less.\nAnd if you want to speed\nup your perception of time,\nyou would blink more.\nNow, you'd have to think of a scenario\nin which that would be useful to you.\nObviously if you're going to blink,\nyou're going to miss things as well.\nBut I think it's a very\ninteresting parameter\nof our visual attention as it\nrelates to time perception,\nbecause what it really speaks to\nis that these\nneuromodulators like dopamine\nor serotonin that adjust frame rate,\nthey're not doing it through\nsome magical mechanism.\nIn fact, there's no single brain area\nthat we can say controls time perception.\nI haven't said today, oh,\nyou know, it's the striatum.\nWell, it involves the striatum\nbut I'm not going to say,\nfor instance, oh, it's the cerebellum.\nThe cerebellum is definitely involved\nin timing of movement,\nsomething for a future podcast,\nbut time perception is what we call\na distributed phenomenon.\nIt's a network of areas in\nthe brain working together.\nBut dopamine and the way that it relates\nto the shuttering of your eyes\nseems to be controlling the\nframe rate on your experience.\nNumerous times on this podcast,\nI've talked about cold exposure\nand nowadays there's a lot of interest\nin things like cold showers, ice baths,\nimmersion in cold water tanks\nand lakes and oceans\nand things of that sort.\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent positive effects\nof cold exposure provided\nit's done properly.\nIt can lead to increases in\nmetabolism, brown fat stores,\nwhich are the good fat\nstores that you want.\nThey're sort of like a furnace\nthat allow you to heat yourself up,\nstay warm in cold environments,\nto reduce inflammation,\nto increase resilience and so forth.\nThere's a study published\nin the \"European Journal of Physiology\"\nshowing that cold exposure can increase\nour baseline levels of\ndopamine robustly, 2.5x,\nand it's a long-lasting\nincrease in dopamine\nand appears to be a healthy one,\nmeaning it doesn't seem to be addictive.\nI'm sure there are some\npeople out there addicted\nto ice baths, but, you know,\nwhen you think about the range\nof dopamine-inducing\nbehaviors that are addictive,\nit seems to be more on\nthe health-promoting side.\nWhat's interesting is that\nbecause cold water exposure\nincreases dopamine, it will also change\nyour perception of time\nand if you've ever done\none of these cold water exposures,\nyou've experienced this.\nYou've experienced getting\nin and feeling like, wow,\nmaking it three minutes is\na really, really long time,\nand you are fine-slicing time.\nYour frame rate is going up.\nPart of that, just at a\nkind of a coarse level\nis you're thinking, this is painful.\nI don't like this. I\nwant to get out, right?\nBut part of it is also\nthat your dopamine levels\nare going up very quickly\nand therefore your perception\nof that discomfort is\nalso being fine-sliced.\nAnd so you could leverage\na tool, for instance,\nwhere you try and entrain your thinking\nto something other than your\nimmediate experience, right?\nThis is a kind of a\ncontroversy, if you will,\nin the cold exposure world.\nThe question is do you try\nand lean into the experience\nand really feel it, or do you\ntry and distract yourself,\nyou know, sing a song or count off,\nyou know, from one to a hundred.\nJust know that whatever tactic you use\nto get through the cold exposure\nthat the dopamine level\nthat's now increased\nin your system is going\nto cause you to fine-slice\nor experience that at slow motion.\nSo a minute is going to\nseem like a lot longer\nthan a minute in reality.\nSo you could, for instance,\ndecide to pay attention\nto some external cue.\nMaybe it's a metronome that\nticks once every 10 seconds.\nYou could decide to think\nabout something else.\nYou could decide to\nsing a song in your head\nor sing a song out loud.\nAll of that will divorce\nyou from the sensation\nthat you experience somewhat,\nbut more so it will divorce you\nfrom the perception of\nyour experience as governed\nby that dopamine increase in frame rate.\nIf that isn't clear, just know this.\nWhen you're in the ice bath,\nyour dopamine levels are high.\nWhen your dopamine levels are high,\nyour experience of the discomfort\nof that ice bath is at higher resolution.\nNow, up until now, I've been\ntalking about how dopamine,\nand to some extent, serotonin\ncan differentially impact\nyour perception of how fast\nor how slowly things are\nhappening in the moment.\nBut remember, we have prospective time,\nwe have our experience\nof time in the moment,\nand we have retrospective time\nand there are beautiful\nstudies that have showed\nthat the dopaminergic\nstate changes the way\nnot just that we experience things now,\nbut that it changes the way\nin which we remember things\nin the past and the rate at\nwhich those things occurred.\nAnd those are in opposite direction.\nSo to make this very simple,\nif something that you\nexperience is fun or varied,\nmeaning it has a lot of\ndifferent components in it\nand is, in other words, is associated\nwith an increase in\ndopamine in your brain,\nyou will experience that\nas going by very fast.\nNow, this is different than the ice bath\nwhich I just said you experienced\nas going by very slowly,\nbut here I'm talking\nabout something that's fun\nand varied that you really like\nand you feel like it\ngoes by very, very fast.\nImagine an amazing day for\na kid at an amusement park.\nThey can do a ton of things. It's all new.\nThey're very excited and they'll feel\nlike it goes by very fast,\nbut later they will\nremember that experience\nas being very long,\nthat it was a long day\nfull of many, many events.\nAnd so there's this\nparadoxical relationship\nbetween how we perceive\nfun, exciting, varied events\nin the present and how we\nremember them in the past.\nFor those of you who've gone on vacation,\nif you've had an amazing day\non vacation, it'll seem like,\nor an amazing vacation overall,\nit will seem like it goes by very fast.\nThe last day of vacation,\nyou sort of go, whoa,\nit went by so fast 'cause\nthere's so much happening.\nBut in memory six to eight\nmonths later, you remember, wow,\nthat just went, you know,\nthat was a long, long thing.\nWe had this. Then we had that.\nThen we did this. Then we had that.\nIt tends to spool out in a longer memory\nthan the actual experience.\nConversely, if you are\nbored with something\nor it's something you really don't like,\nit's going to seem like\nit takes a long time\nto go through that\nexperience in the moment,\nbut retroactively, looking back,\nit will seem like that\nmoment was very short.\nSo the other day I was\nwaiting in the waiting room\nfor the dentist, it was pretty boring.\nI was just kind of sitting there.\nThere wasn't much going on.\nAnd it did seem like it was\ngoing on an awfully long time,\nbut indeed, looking back,\nit just seems like, okay,\nI sat in that room, not much happened.\nAnd so it seems like\na very short time bin.\nThis seems to be an efficiency\nof how the brain stores information,\ndopamine being associated, of course,\nwith fun and varied experiences\nand low dopamine being associated\nwith kind of empty, boring,\nor what at the time seem\nlike long experiences.\nAnd this whole thing has been stamped down\ninto the scientific literature\nby those earlier experiments\nwhere they take human\nbeings and isolate them\nin certain environments.\nYou know, take away all their\nclocks and watches and cues\nand about what time of day it is\nand what time of night it is\nand allow people to have a life\nwhere they can either read\nand work and do things\nor where they have very little to do.\nWhen people are isolated\nin very boring environments\nand they don't have access\nto time cues, time dilates.\nThey tend to assume that time\nhas gone on very, very long.\nAnd so the reason I bring this\nup is we aren't just driven\nby these circadian clocks\nand these circannual clocks\nand these ultradian clocks.\nWe are driven by these timers that vary\ndepending on our level of excitement\nand they vary depending\non our level of excitement\nbecause of these neuromodulators,\ndopamine and serotonin.\nSo the way I like to think about it\nis that you have two\nclocks, two stopwatches.\nOne is a dopaminergic stopwatch\nthat fine-slices really closely.\nIt's like, counts off milliseconds\nand it's grabbing a movie\nof your experience at\nvery high resolution.\nAnd in the other hand,\nyou have a stopwatch\nthat's gathering big time bins,\nbig ticks along the, you know,\nthe hand is moving at bigger intervals,\nyou know, marking off time.\nAnd depending on whether\nor not you're excited\nor whether or not you're bored,\nyou're using different stopwatches on time\nand therefore you're perceiving\nyour experience differently.\nOne very interesting aspect to the way\nthat neuromodulators like\ndopamine and novelty interact\nwith time perception and memory\nis how we perceive our\nrelationship to places and people.\nSo really interesting literature showing\nthat the more novel\nexperiences we have in a place,\nthe more we feel we know\nthat place, obviously,\nbut the longer we feel we've been there.\nSo here's the kind of\ngedanken or thought experiment\nthat illustrates what's in the literature.\nLet's say I were to move to New York City.\nI happen to really like New York City.\nI've never lived there, but\nlet's say I lived there.\nI lived in a given apartment for a year\nand I would have a number\nof different experiences\nin this mental experiment.\nLet's say I had 100 different\nexciting and new experiences.\nI would at the end of that\nyear feel as if I lived there\na certain period of time, one year.\nI would actually know\nI lived there one year.\nIf however I lived in\nthree different places\nin New York City and I met\nthree times as many people\nand I had three times as\nmany novel experiences,\nI would actually feel as if\nI had been there much longer\nthan had I only lived in one location.\nThis is also true for social interactions.\nWhen we move to multiple\nor several novel environments\nwith somebody else,\nwe tend to feel as if we\nknow that person much better\nand that they know us much better.\nNow, of course, we get the\nopportunity to interact\nwith those people in different contexts\nand so indeed we do get the\nopportunity to see them,\nfor instance, at the coffee\nshop, how they order coffee.\nYou maybe go to a sports\nevent, how they act there.\nMaybe how they interact with your family.\nYou're getting a sense of\nthem in different contexts.\nThat's certainly playing a role,\nbut it seems as if the\nmore novelty you experience\nwith somebody, not only the\nmore familiar they are to you,\nbut the more time you feel\nyou've spent with them,\neven though the total amount of time\ncan be exactly the same.\nAnd so that's a very interesting aspect\nof how our perception of time\nand these neuromodulators\nand novelty can shape the\nway not just that we perceive\na given event in our\nworld, but how we relate\nto a place or relate to a person.\nSo we've talked a lot about\nthe different neurochemicals\nand how those neurochemicals can influence\nour perception of time.\nWe haven't talked a lot\nabout the neural circuits\nand the various areas of the\nbrain that underlie this.\nI do want to touch on that\nby highlighting a really wonderful study.\nThis was a study published in \"Neuron,\"\nalso a Cell Press journal,\nexcellent journal.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"Behavioral, Physiological,\nand Neural Signatures of Surprise\nDuring Naturalistic Sports Viewing.\"\nThis experiment is really cool.\nThey did brain imaging on individuals\nwho are watching basketball games.\nThese were basketball games\nthat actually took\nplace that were recorded\nand the subjects watching\nthese basketball games\nin some cases, not all, had some interest\nin who would win or lose,\nand in some cases, not all,\nthe subjects in these studies\nhad some prior knowledge\nof which team they thought was better,\nwhich team was likely to\nwin or not likely to win.\nThe basic findings of the study\nwere that they could measure surprise\nby the release of dopamine\nin two areas of the brain,\npart of what are called,\nis called, excuse me,\nthe mesolimbic reward pathway.\nSo the two areas of the\nbrain that are important here\nare the nucleus accumbens and the VTA,\nthe ventral tegmental area.\nThese are areas that release dopamine\nas kind of a token of reward\nany time something is surprising\nor a positive expectation is met, okay?\nSo if I predict that my\nteam dribbling down court\nis going to score on this drive\nand they get the ball in the basket,\na little bit of dopamine is released.\nThese two brain areas light up\nin the functional imaging so-called FSRI,\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\nthat they used in this study.\nWhat's really interesting about this study\nis not just that dopamine\nwas released any time\nthat something the subject\nwanted to see happened, right,\nany time they wanted to see\ntheir team score, they scored,\nbut also during surprise.\nSo if they thought for instance,\nand they would hit a button to predict\nthat their team was going to\nscore in this particular drive\nand they didn't, well, then\ndopamine could also be released\nin response to that surprise.\nSo this speaks again to\ndopamine being something\nthat's important not\njust for positive events,\nbut for unexpected events.\nNow, that's all very interesting\nand speaks to the fact\nthat dopamine is a kind of\nflexible currency in the brain.\nIt's doled out, if you will, or released\nwhen something that one\nhopes will happen happens\nand it's released when there's a surprise,\neven if it's a kind of\na negative surprise.\nIt's not something that the\nsubject wanted to happen.\nBut the more interesting thing\nis how that relates to time perception.\nWhat they found was\nregardless of what caused\nthe dopamine release, the\nfrequency of dopamine release\npredicted how the subjects\nparsed the time bins\nof the game they were watching.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, when you watch a basketball game\nor you watch anything,\nchildren playing or talking\nto your spouse or whatever,\nyou're batching time.\nHow are you batching time?\nWell, you could batch a\nmeal by the, I don't know,\nthe appetizer, the main\ncourse, and the dessert,\nbut it turns out that's\nnot what you're doing.\nYou're batching time according\nto the frequency of dopamine pulses,\nthe frequency of dopamine release.\nAnd that's what they saw in this study.\nIf they evaluated people's perceptions\nof the passage of time,\nwhat they found is that that matched\nnot whether or not the, you know,\nit was a particular\ntime point in the game,\nnot whether or not their\nteam was going down court\nor running back up court to play defense,\nbut the dopamine released\nserved as markers\nwhich would predict the frame rate\nof their perception of the experience.\nAnd if that sounds complicated,\nwhat I mean is how often\nand when you release\ndopamine is actually setting\nthe frame rate on the entire\nperception of everything,\nnot just for positive\nevents or negative events.\nSo what this means is as\nyou're going through life,\ndopamine and the release of\ndopamine is saying that's over\nand now you're in a new phase of your life\neven if it's very short, right?\nSo if I get up in the morning\nand I really need a cup of\ncoffee, as you probably all know,\nI wait 90 minutes to 120 minutes\nbefore I drink my coffee,\nbut then I get my coffee\nand surely there's a dopamine\nhit there, I promise you,\nI actually am starting to carve up my day\naccording to dopamine hits.\nConsciously or subconsciously,\nI'm actually carving up my experience\naccording to when I'm getting\ndopamine throughout my day.\nThis governance over\nour perception of time\nthat dopamine has points to a very clear,\nvery actionable, and very powerful tool.\nAnd that is a tool that many\npeople have talked about before\nwhich are habits.\nPeople have discussed habits\nin a variety of contexts\nbut in the context of dopamine reward\nand time perception, what this means\nis that placing specific habitual routines\nat particular intervals\nthroughout your day\nis a very, not just convenient,\nbut a very good way to\nincorporate the dopamine system\nso that you divide your day into a series\nof what I would call functional units.\nWhat would this look like?\nIt would mean waking up and\nhaving one specific habit\nthat you always engage in that\ncauses a release of dopamine.\nYou can say, well, great.\nThat'll make me feel\ngood. And I would agree.\nDopamine released generally\nmakes us feel motivated\nBut it would have an\nadditional effect of marking\nthat time of day as the beginning\nof a particular time bin.\nThen inserting another habit,\nperhaps the beginning of,\nI don't know, your breakfast or something,\nbut recognizing that that's a habit\nand being fairly habitual, you\ndon't have to be, you know,\nobsessively precise about the timing,\nbut that regular sequencing of things\nis going to lead not\njust to dopamine release\nas it relates to reward and\nmotivation and feeling good,\nbut it actually becomes the way\nin which we carve up our\nentire experience of our day.\nAnd this is almost a circular argument.\nYou could say, well, of course, you know,\nI do one thing, then I do the next,\nthen I do the next, and\nthat's how I perceive my day.\nThat's my day. It's my list.\nIt's my to-do list, et cetera.\nBut what I'm saying is that\non the basis of this study,\nI should mention the first\nauthor, his last name is Antony.\nIt was Antony et al. It\nwas published in 2020.\nThe study on basketball\nviewing, what it points to\nis that by engaging in specific habits\nthat we know we can perform well,\nwe are actually setting\nthe frame rate on our day.\nAnd so I think there will soon come a time\nwhere human beings are not\njust thinking of, okay,\nmy morning routine and\nmy afternoon routine,\nI think that can be useful, and in fact,\nI used or mentioned a structure\nof that sort earlier in the episode,\nbut rather thinking about\nwhat's actually going on\nat the level of our biology,\nwhich is that dopamine is marking time.\nHabits are a very clear way\nin which we can invoke dopamine release\nand therefore provide time\nmarkers, and what this means\nis that, for instance,\nduring your morning,\nyou might insert habit one and habit two\nat, say, I don't know, 8 AM and 10 AM,\nand in doing that, that marks an epoch,\na little batch of time\nin your morning routine\nthat's distinct from the\nsecond half of your morning.\nIn other words, habits serve as flankers\nor markers for the passage of your day.\nNow, if that seems kind of hyper-neurotic\nor why would I want to\nstructure my life like that,\nI would say that many people would do well\nto structure their life like\nthat and to utilize habits\nnot just for the sake of\nwhat you do during the habit,\nbut because of the fact that\nthe habits serve as a marker\nbecause of the way they\ncan evoke dopamine release.\nAnd in doing that, you are\nable to segment your day\ninto a bunch of smaller, if\nyou want them to be smaller,\nor larger functional units.\nIf anyone wants to experiment with this,\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nputs out a newsletter.\nIt's called the Neural Network Newsletter.\nYou can sign up for it at hubermanlab.com.\nWe put it out each month.\nYou can see the previous newsletters.\nThere's zero cost.
