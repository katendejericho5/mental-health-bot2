    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the hubman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today marks the fifth episode\nin our sixth episode series all about\nsleep with expert guest Dr Matthew\nWalker today's episode focuses on the\ninextricable link between sleep and our\nmental health for instance a specific\nstage of sleep called rapid eye movement\nor REM sleep is critical for removing\nthe emotional content of our previous\ndays memories and in doing so provides a\nsort of therapy within sleep that allows\nus to feel emotionally restored when we\nwake the next morning we discuss what\nhappens when you are deprived of REM\nsleep to a small or greater degree and\nwe discuss how to improve the quality\nand quantity of your REM sleep in order\nto ensure mental health we also discuss\nscience-based protocols for reducing\nrumination and negative thoughts before\nsleep the information shared by Dr\nWalker in today's episode is sure to be\ncritical for anyone that is either\nstruggling with mental health issues or\nwho simply wants to bolster their\noverall mental health before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\neight sleep eight sleep makes Smart\nmattress covers with with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity many\ntimes on this podcast we discuss how in\norder to fall and stay deeply asleep\nyour body temperature actually needs to\ndrop by about 1 to 3° and in order to\nwake up feeling maximally refreshed and\nenergized your body temperature needs to\nheat up by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmakes it very easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nso that it's easy to fall and stay\nasleep and wake up feeling refreshed I\nstarted sleeping on an eight- Sleep\nmattress cover several years ago and it\nhas completely and positively\ntransformed my sleep so much so that\nwhen I travel to hotels or airbnbs I\nreally miss my eight sleep I've even\nshipped my eight sleep out to hotels\nthat I've been staying in because it\nimproves my sleep that much if you'd\nlike to try eightsleep you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman

Us by element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans plenty of the electrolytes\nmagnesium potassium and sodium and no\nsugar as I mentioned before on this\npodcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want\nto be clear people who already consume a\nlot of salt or who have high blood\npressure or who happen to consume a lot\nof processed foods that typically\ncontain salt need to control their salt\nintake however if you're somebody who\neats pretty clean and you're somebody\nwho exercises and you're drinking a lot\nof water there's a decent chance that\nyou could benefit from ingesting more\nelectrolytes with your liquids the\nreason for that is that all the cells in\nour body including the nerve cells the\nneurons require the electrolytes in\norder to function properly so we don't\njust want to be hydrated we want to be\nhydrated with proper electrolyte levels\nwith element that's very easy to do what\nI do is when I wake up in the morning I\nconsume about 16 to 32 ounces of water\nand I'll dissolve a packet of element in\nthat water I'll also do the same when I\nexercise especially if it's on a hot day\nand I'm sweating a lot and sometimes\nI'll even have a third element packet\ndissolved in water if I'm exercising\nreally hard or sweating a lot or if I\njust noticed that I'm not consuming\nenough salt with

today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers\nProfessional Therapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out entirely online\nI've been doing therapy for over 30\nyears initially it was a requirement for\nbeing let back in school but I decided\nto keep up with that therapy because Ed\nthe therapy has three essential\ncomponents which are excellent rapport\nwith the therapist support from the\ntherapist and valuable insights from the\ntherapist that we wouldn't otherwise be\nable to arrive at well then it's a\nterrific way to improve our mental\nlandscape both our emotional state and\nour behaviors better help allows you to\nfind a therapist with whom you have\nthose three key components and it also\nmakes it very easy to schedule again the\nsessions are carried out entirely online\nand even if you're extremely busy or\ntraveling a lot or have a lot of family\nand business obligations better help\nallows you to access those therapy\nsessions regularly so that you can\nconstantly improve there's just oh so\nmuch data supporting that quality\ntherapy can improve our mental health\nand the overall landscape of our lives\nin fact I view quality therapy as\nimportant as physical exercise and I\nknow many others do as well there\ncertainly aren't a replacement for one\nanother but if you're doing physical\nexercise meaning resistance training and\ncardiovascular training and you're doing\nregular quality therapy of the sort that\nbetter help can provide well then you're\nessentially doing as much as anyone\npossibly can to improve your mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com\nhuberman to get 10% off your first month\nagain that's betterhelp.com\nhuberman and now for my conversation\nwith Dr Matthew Walker Dr Matthew Walker\nwelcome back Dr Andrew huberman Delight\nto be back during the course of this\nseries we've of course been talking\nabout sleep and you've talked about the\nbiology of sleep ways to improve maybe\neven optimize sleep you defined what\noptimizing one's sleep actually\nis talked about learning and memory\ncreativity caffeine naps food exercise\nand so much more\ntoday I'm excited that you're going to\nteach us about the relationship between\nsleep and emotion regulation but also\nmental health mental health challenges\nbut I sometimes like to remind people\nthat mental health includes the word\nHealth it's not all about mental illness\nit's also about how to improve one's\nHealth as well as ways to combat certain\nforms of mental illness or challenges so\nto start things off maybe you could just\ngive us the basics of the relationship\nbetween sleep and emotional states or\none's ability to regulate their own\nemotions this is an area of work that\nwe've been uh interested in and doing a\nlot of research on for about 20 or so\nyears\nnow and I would say that probably the\nmost striking statement I can offer\nupfront is the following in that 20\nyears of research we have not been able\nto discover a single psychiatric\ncondition in which sleep is\nnormal and to me it has taught me\neverything that I need to know about\nthis very intimate bidirectional\nrelationship between your sleep health\nand your mental health and you're right\nto emphasize that notion of mental\nhealth because we're not just going to\nspeak about some of the sort of\nchallenging aspects of sleep and\npsychiatric disorders but we'll speak\nabout some of the benefits that sleep\ncan provide when you get it to turn the\ntables and we move in the direction not\nof Mental Illness but we move in the\ndirection of mental Wellness so I'm\nexcited sort of make sure that I I don't\nfall prey to\nthat stepping back still though what\nabout this relationship between just\nsleep and our basic emotional regulation\nand our emotional\nstability I'm sure everyone has seen the\nexample or had the example as a parent\nof that parent holding a child and the\nchild is crying and they look at you and\nthey say well they just didn't sleep\nwell last night as if there's some\nmiraculous parental knowledge that bad\nsleep the night before equals bad mood\nand emotional reactivity and regulation\nthe next day and some years ago now we\nwere fascinated by this but we couldn't\nreally unearth basic science that would\nhelp us explain what was going on and\nwhy that was so clearly the case so we\ndid an initial study where we took a\ngroup of healthy people no signs of\npsychiatric illness or emotional\ninstability and we gave them a full\nnight of sleep or we sleep deprive them\nand then the next day we put them inside\nof a brain scanner and we showed them a\nwhole range of emotional visual images\nis ranging from very neutral all the way\nup to quite unpleasant and negative and\nwe were looking at how the brain was\nreacting to those emotional experiences\nwith versus without sleep and the\nstructure that we'd initially focused on\nwas a structure that you've spoken about\nbefore called the amydala and you\nactually have one on the left and the\nright side of your brain and the amydala\nis the centerpiece region for the\ngeneration of emotional reactions both\npositive and negative but here we're\nfocusing on that aversive that negative\naspect and when we looked at that\nstructure in people who are sleep\ndeprived what we saw relative to the\npeople who'd had a full night of sleep\nwas a 60% 60 60% increase in amydala\n[Music]\nresponsivity under conditions of sleep\ndeprivation that is quite a striking\namplification in fact we to that date\nwith all of us that these on sleep and\nsleep loss had not quite seen an effect\nsize within the brain that was that was\nthat big sorry to interrupt but just to\nmake sure that everyone's on the same\npage so people are being shown images\nwith varying degrees of emotionality\nincluding images that are known to evoke\nnegative averse emotions as we call them\nin the laboratory um could be feelings\nof fear anger disgust revulsion what\nwhatever negative\nveilance was it the case that sleep\ndeprivation increased the activity in\nthe amydala to such images by 60% only\nfor the aversive images or for let's say\na neutral image um presented to somebody\nwho has had plenty of quality\nsleep um let's say it is I'm making up\nthe units here gives us two out of 10\nunits of Amal activation this isn't the\nway Neuroscience is done but for sake of\ndiscussion is it the case then that that\nneutral image would provide a you know a\nsix out of 10 a level of activation or\nwas it only for aversive images so the\nway we did the analysis first was we\nused almost a a correlation approach so\nwe sort of told the brain Imaging\nanalysis to say look here are the the\nratings of these pictures and they go\nfrom very neutral to increasingly\nnegative and aversive and show me what\nin the brain is reacting to that curve\nthat gradient curve and sure enough\nyou've got the magnitude overall was 60%\nbut it's a very interesting point that\nyou make because worthy amydala started\nto respond and that res responsivity\nstarted to hook up in the activation and\nthe sort of aggravation Direction was\nmuch earlier in the curve of\nemotionality in other words things that\npreviously when you've had a good night\nof sleep do not feel particularly\nemotional started to become rather\nemotional when you were not getting\nsufficient sleep\nso it heightened the sensitivity of the\ninitial triggering of the emotional\nresponse and then the more emotional it\nbecame the more separate those two sort\nof reactivity curves became from the\nAmala when you had sleep versus when you\nhad not sleep or had not slept I should\nsay to us then the question became well\nwhy why is the amydala so reactive and\ncontrolled when you are absent sleep and\nwe did another analysis and what we\nfound was that there was a structure in\nyour frontal lobe and the frontal lobe\njust sits directly sort of if you think\nabout your eyes and you go directly up\nyour in your frontal lobe and it was a\nparticular part of the frontal lobe the\nmiddle part that sits right between your\neyes something that we call the medial\nprefrontal cortex and what we found was\nthat with a night of sleep the med Al\nprefrontal cortex was strongly connected\nto the amydala why is that important\nit's because that part of the your\nfrontal lobe is very good at acting like\na control rational mechanism on your\ndeep sort of you know it's not\nNeanderthal but your deep emotional\nbrain centers but without sleep we found\nthat that connection had been\nsevered and so it was almost as though\nwithout sleep you become all emotional\ngas pedal and too little regulatory\ncontrol break and so you couldn't\nmodulate those emotions anywhere near as\neffectively now some people may say well\nhang on a second you that was a total\nnight of sleep deprivation and that's\nnot really relevant for me because I I\ndon't sleep enough I know that from all\nof the previous episodes that uh I've\ngone through here hopefully if you've\nlistened to them but I'm usually maybe\ngetting five or 6 hours of sleep is this\nreally relevant so we started doing that\nstudy we wanted to say Let's do an what\nwe call an ecological study more of a\nreal world sleep restriction rather than\ntotal\ndeprivation and we were about halfway\nthrough that study when a wonderful\nJapanese research group essentially\npublished the study that we were doing\nand what was great is that they did it\neven in a more rigorous way and\nessentially what they were able to do is\nreplicate exactly what we'd found but\nnow by putting people on sort of less\nthan 6 hours of sleep for five nights\nand sure enough you got the same\nresponse so that was very clear to us\nthat there is some sensitivity there's a\nreason why you become so\nunbuckled emotionally when you are not\ngetting sufficient sleep it's the reason\nthat you have almost this sort of\nerratic pendulum like sort of\nresponsivity when you're not getting\nsufficient sleep that notion of I just\nsnap dot dot dot or you apologize and\nyou say look I am so sorry I just bit\nyour H off I just haven't been getting\nenough sleep and so we could start to\nunderstand what in the brain was\nhappening when you didn't get sleep it\nsuch an important finding uh for a\ncouple of reasons that maybe we can\nexplore um previously on the podcast we\nhad a guest um doctor he's a\nneurosurgeon Matt McDougall he's the\nlead neurosurgeon at um neurolink yeah\nhe came up through Stanford works on\ndeep brain stimulation Etc and I love\nhis description of what the prefrontal\ncortex does it jbes perfectly with the\nway you describe it which is he said the\nmain function of the prefrontal cortex\nis to\nsay to specific brain areas under\nspecific contexts so um the sh of course\nis a you know his way of describing\nneural inhibition so quieting of neural\nactivity in certain brain circuits under\ncertain conditions because there are\nconditions under which you want your\namydala activation to be very robust you\nknow fast and um there's time for uh you\nknow protecting oneself maybe even\ncertain situations for Swift violent\naction to protect your family Etc but\nthe prefrontal cortex seems to be able\nto hold it in mind so to speak what the\ncontext is under which that would be\nappropriate versus when it would be\ninappropriate a great example of that\npeople can think of if all of a sudden a\ngun is pointed in your\nface you would want your amydala to\nreact if it's in the real world but if\nyou're at the movie theaters and you see\na gun pointed in your face your igula\ndoesn't really react as much why because\nyou're prefontal cortex understood the\nword that you describe which is\ncontext but in some ways it seems as\nthough you\nbecome almost regress to this more basic\nfundament mental\nElemental you know emotional brain and\nthe Red Mist descends and you really\ncan't see much more because your\nprefrontal cortex seems to be absent you\nbecome very reflex driven and we don't\nwant to um go too uh far a tangent of on\nprefrontal cortex but one of the most\nbeautiful descriptions of prefrontal\nCortex I ever heard was also from a\ncolleague Eric nudson at Stanford who's\nnow retired does beautiful work on\nneuroplasticity and he described how\nwhen people or animals have lesions to\ncertain regions of the prefrontal cortex\nthey become stimulus-driven machines\nsuch that you know if you if you go like\nthis to a you know to a puppy or to Baby\nthey'll look to the snapping finger but\nat some point you know we all learn that\nyou know there must be a reason for us\nto follow the snapping of the fingers in\ndifferent locations in space but with a\nprefrontal damage people and animals\njust become like machines whatever\nstimulus is there they Orient to and\nthis has implications for ADHD Etc one\nof the things that I want to um ask\nabout to take us back to the specific\nrelationship between sleep reduced\nmedial prefrontal activity and\nemotionality is this feeling when we're\nsleep deprived that certain things just\ngreat on us a bit more you know I had\nthis experience recently unfortunately\nthere was a night where I didn't get\nmuch sleep at all and then the next day\nI was on a phone call and the person I\nwas talking to I I I'm quite fond of but\nthey were they had a lot of energy and\nthey were talking they were kind of\ncoming at me with a bunch of stuff that\nthey wanted to and it just felt like you\nknow it was grading on my system and I\nknew because I was sleep deprived that\nyou know they were entirely well-meaning\nand so you just kind of resist but it's\nincredible how cold water loud noises uh\nrequests of our time things like that\nbecome very irritating and they grate on\nus yeah when we're sleep deprived\nwhereas when we're rested it's like oh\nyeah okay they're you know talking kind\nof faster kind of loud okay somebody is\nrequesting something else I'll put it in\nmy list or maybe I'll the Ator or you\nknow the the uh cold shower that you\nknow feels like got to get over this\nthreshold to get into like when you're\nrested you're like all right let's do\nthis right you know maybe even let's go\nI I'm excited for it but when you're\ntired o it is as if the um the brain is\nfighting for any sense of Peace it can\npossibly get and that peace is\ninterrupted by almost anything and\neverything it is a grim situation and\nwe've certainly heard that from you know\npatients and individuals it's almost as\nthough the world that they are\nexperiencing they look at and they say\nyou know what you're in an 11 and I need\nyou at a seven right now it is just too\nmuch and this comes back to that result\nthat we described that when the amydala\ncrosses the threshold and says okay\nthings are getting emotional things are\ngetting unpleasant I'm going to be\nresponding\nnegatively in an angry way or a fearful\nway that starts much earlier so the\nthreshold for triggering your emotional\naversive reaction is much lower and\nthat's why the person's voice when you\nhear it first normally if you had a\ngreat night of sleep you'd say gosh you\nknow what today I really love your\nenergy it's it's really it's so\ninfectious versus a day when you're not\nsleeping you just think I just I'm\nlifting my earbuds out of my ears I\ndon't know if I can take this much\nlonger and so that was where we were\nable to manipulate sleep one way which\nis to say I dial sleep down and then I\nlook at the emotional brain and you can\nsee this ramping up of the emotional\nreactivity in these basic kind of gutur\nall centers but then we wanted to do the\ninverse we wanted to instead see if we\ncould insert sleep back in in other\nwords manipulate sleep and dial it back\nup could you get a disapp ation in the\nemotional\nreaction and here we decided to throw a\nsecond ingredient into the equation not\njust simply looking at your emotional\nreactivity but we wanted to look at\nemotional memory now in a previous\nepisode we've spoken a lot about sleep\nand memory but there we were speaking\nabout really quite neutral memory\ntextbook like memory fact-based memory\nemotional memory is very different and\nif I were to ask you you Andrew cast\nyour mind back to some of your earliest\nchildhood memories or your team memories\nand if anyone listening were to do that\nmy guess is that almost all of the\nmemories that you recall are memories of\nan emotional nature positive or\nnegative why is that it's because one of\nthe functions of emotions when it comes\nto memory is to R flag and prioritize\nthat experience that memory as being\nSalient because it's emotional and that\ninstructs the brain that this\ninformation in particular is very\nrelevant to us as an organism why\nbecause the rest of the brain is\nshouting at me this is emotional so\nthere is something very privileged and\nvery special about an emotional memory\nlike a red flag that tags it for\npriority in the brain but something I\nstarted to notice when I would read the\ndata both the neural data and the\nsubjective data on emotional memory led\nme to get very interested in what\nhappens with emotional memories over\ntime because what you will hear is that\nif I were to ask you you know recall an\nemotional memory just try to remember it\nmy guess is that now at the time of\nrecollection much later on you are not\nhaving the same regurgitation of the\nsame visceral emotional reaction that\nyou had at the time of the experience\nwhat that sort of turned a light bulb\nmoment on for me was that somewhere\nbetween the initial experience and the\nlater recollection of that emotional\nmemory the brain has done a very clever\ntrick it has divorced the emotion from\nthe memory so now when you come to\nrecollect that emotional memory let's\nsay days later or even months later in\nsome ways it is a memory of an emotional\nevent but it is no longer as powerfully\nemotional itself as it was at the time\nof the experience right and I started to\nwonder is that time or is that time\nasleep so we did a study and we had\npeople experience these emotional\nmemories sort of essentially make\nemotional memories and they were doing\nit inside of a scanner and then we gave\nthem a night of sleep or even a nap and\nthen we brought them back or we just had\nthem learn those emotional memories in\nthe morning and then bring them back\nafter an identical amount of time to try\nto soften those emotional memories but\nwithout sleep and we put them back in\nthe scanner and we were able to look to\nsee when you come back later in that\nsecond session is your emotional and you\nrecollect those experiences and you\nrelive them is the emotional reactivity\nat that second session any different to\nthe first session and is that different\nif that time elapse has contained a full\nnight of sleep versus you've just been\nawake and what we found is that in those\npeople who remained awake across the day\nhaving had those emotional memories\nessentially implanted implanted sounds a\nlittle bit sort of Big Brother I don't\nmean it that way but they'd learned them\nthe amydala was just still as responsive\nas they were recalling and reliving and\nreexperiencing those emotional memories\nbut in those people who had the same\namount of time to process the memories\nbut had had a full night of sleep we saw\nthis incredible emotional amygdala dep\npotentiation and what that taught me was\nthat the sleeping brain was able\nto almost detox the emotional memory it\nis think about it like um an\ninformational orange that the emotional\nmemory Has This Bitter emotional rind\naround it and then you've got the\ninformational orange in the middle and\nwhat sleep was doing was stripping the\nbitter emotional rind off the\ninformational orange so that then when\nyou came back the next day again it is\nnow a memory of an emotional event but\nit's no longer triggering that strong\nvisceral reaction in other words and we\ndescribe this Theory as something called\novernight\nforgetting which is that when it comes\nto an emotional memory you both sleep to\nforget and sleep to remember\nrespectively which is that you sleep to\nremember the information the memory of\nthe experience but it is no longer\nemotional\nitself and from there we built a\nbiological model of exactly how this\nworks because when we looked at the\nSleep group who'd had that full 8-hour\nopportunity we asked the question\nbecause we'd measured their sleep what\nis it about that sleep that seems to\nprovide this form of it's almost\novernight\ntherapy how is it doing that what stage\nof sleep is doing that and sure enough\nwhat we found was that it was REM sleep\nrapid eye movement sleep associated with\ndreaming and the greater the amount of\nREM sleep the greater the amount of\nemotional depotentiation the greater the\namount of sort of emotion detox that you\ngot the next\nday and one of the fascinating things\nthat we didn't um quite mention in uh\nthe episode where we described what is\nsleep and we described the different\nstages including RAM and we spoke about\nthe brain\nchanges something utterly unique happens\nduring REM sleep levels of a brain\nchemical called noradrenaline are\ncompletely shut off it is the only time\nduring the 24-hour period when you see\nthe complete cessation of neur\nadrenaline in the brain and of course\nneur adrenaline is associated with many\ndifferent functions and you've elegantly\ndescribed them one of the functions is\nthat it's associated with emotional\nresponsivity and the focus and that sort\nof strong um sort of emotional energy\nand people will know we speak about it\nhas two names noradrenaline or\nnorepinephrine same thing us UK but\npeople of course are familiar with the\nsister chemical in the body called\nadrenaline upstairs in the brain we can\nthink about noradrenaline and during REM\nsleep neur adrenaline is completely shut\noff this stress Associated neurochemical\nit's not only associated with stress but\nit's associated with lots of things but\nstress included is noradrenaline shut\noff in the brain and body during uh\nrapid eye movement sleep no it's not it\nseems to be specifically within the\nbrain that there is this blockade of\nnoradrenaline and serot goes down too\nwhereas another chemical called atile\ncholine which is another\nneurotransmitter that ramps up in the\nbrain so if there is a brain chemical\nthat seems to be underlying REM sleep or\ndream sleep it seems to be acetycholine\nand in fact in some parts of the brain\nyou can see almost a 30% greater amount\nof acetel choline in some brain regions\nthan when we're awake yet on the other\nhand when we think about noradrenaline\nand serotonin they are both shut off so\nthe stress related chemical within the\nbrain is Switched Off during REM sleep\nhowever if you look at other parts of\nthe brain the memory related centers of\nthe brain such as the hippocampus that\nwe've spoken about before and the\namydala that I just mentioned too those\nare very active during REM sleep so we\nlaid out this biological model that is\nalmost beautiful that REM sleep is this\nperfect condition for emotional\novernight therapy where you can re\nactivate and re sort of experience and\nreprocess those emotional memories but\nyou're doing it in a neurochemically\nquote unquote safe environment that\nallows you to strip away the emotion\nfrom the memory I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge our sponsor ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens and is\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs by now\nI'm sure you've all heard me say that\nI've been taking ag1 since 2012 and\nindeed that is true now of course I do\nconsume regular Whole Foods every day I\nstrive to get those Foods mostly from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources however I do find it hard to get\nenough servings of fruits and vegetables\neach day so with ag1 I ensure that I get\nenough of the vitamins minerals\nPrebiotic fiber and other things\ntypically found in fruits or vegetables\nand of course I still make sure to eat\nfruits and vegetables and in that way\nprovide a sort of insurance that I'm\ngetting enough of what I need in\naddition the ad adaptogens and other\nmicronutrients in ag1 really help buffer\nagainst stress and ensure that the cells\nand organs and tissues of my body are\ngetting the things they need people\noften ask me that if they were going to\ntake Just One supplement what that\nsupplement should be and I always answer\nag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go\nto drink a1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer you'll get five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman in some ways it does resemble\nbehavioral desensitization therapy\nwhereby under the care of a qualified\nyou know psychiatrist or psychologist\nsomebody will um be encouraged to recall\nin a great degree of detail some very\ndifficult maybe even traumatic event um\nand through repetition and of course\nthrough the knowledge that there's\nsupport in the immediate environment\nthat will allow them to um you know\nsafely move through that experience you\nknow should their their heart rate go up\nthey're sweating profusely having\ntrouble getting the words out there very\nunfortunately common features of trauma\nand and negative memories but the idea\nas I understand is to repeat the recall\nmany times often in that safe\nenvironment such that eventually what\nwas initially a really\nterrible event remains a terrible event\nbut the emotional load of that event is\nremoved from the person's sort of neural\nunderstanding of the event is the way\nI've heard it described is what starts\nas a tragic traumatic story eventually\nbecomes a kind of a sad boring story\nboring to the person who's saying it\nmeaning it doesn't evoke as much\nautonomic arousal exactly and in some\nways that's the perfect description of\nthis overnight therapy process\nthat it becomes a memory that is no\nlonger triggering an emotional reaction\nand in some ways that's what you want if\nyou go back to my description from an\nevolutionary perspective I told you that\none of the functions of emotions is to\nred flag and prioritize the memory at\nthe time of learning to say that it's\nimportant that's a very adaptive process\nit helps us prioritize which things we\nreally should be focusing on and\nremembering but it's not not adaptive\nfor you to hold on to that emotion long\nterm once you've started and there has\nbeen some suggestion in the literature\nbefore we were doing this work that\nmaybe one thing you can do with trauma\nand Trauma memories is sleep deprive\nindividuals the very first night after\nthe trauma because we knew at the time\nsleep is important for memory and what\nyou would like to do and it's very\nsimilar to that movie Sunshine Spotless\nMind I always forget the Eternal Eternal\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\nthank you I didn't see the movie but I\nhear it's good yeah and what they try to\ndo is Target in the brain these you know\ndifficult painful experiences and just\nexcise them from the brain and that was\nthe suggestion could you pop those\nmemories out of the biography of that\nindividual and save them the trauma I\nwould argue that's not really what you\nwant to do because let's say that I am\num I have a trauma experience where I\nwas walking home at night from The Sleep\nlaboratory late at night and I was\ncoming down the kind of an alley to take\na shortcut and someone sticks me up with\na gun maybe some\nviolence I don't want to remove that\nmemory I would like to remove the trauma\nresponse associated with that memory but\nI would argue for me as an organism it's\nstill very important for me to remember\nthat that alley was associated with a\nbad experience and I should forego going\ndown that very same route again I want\nto hold on to the memory the information\nI want to let go of the emotion I want\nto sleep to remember and I want to sleep\nto\nforget and I'll come on to why I think\nthat's relevant to PTSD when we perhaps\nspeak about that condition and it's very\nvery relevant but coming back to REM\nsleep we looked back in the literature\nto see if we could find signs that REM\nsleep had this relationship with even\njust your basic emotional reactivity and\nthere was some wonderful work by a\ngentleman that you will know from\nStanford probably one of the founding\nfathers of modern day sleep research a\ngentleman called William DeMent yeah who\npassed away a few years ago he did um\nmight have been one of the people who\ncoined the term rapid eye movement sleep\nbut I don't think he was the one who\ndiscovered it correct he was not but he\nwas well up there in terms of\nunderstanding both sort of what its term\nwas and also what its function\nwas he Legend as he was very early on\nthis was probably in the 60s he would\ntake individuals because we didn't\nreally have the first published report\nof these two types of sleep of REM and\nnon-rem until they collected the data or\nfound the data in 1953 it was published\nin 1954 so in other words we discovered\nthat you know even up to then prior to\nthen we just thought sleep was sleep we\ndidn't have any knowledge that the these\ndifferent stages so in the same year\nthat um Francis Crick you know un\nunveiled this incredible helical\nstructure that was called a DNA strand\nwe also discovered the different stages\nof sleep but in the 60s then William\nDeMent knowing that there were these two\ntypes of sleep and knowing that there\nwas something that was going on with REM\nsleep were people were dreaming and he\nwould be waking people up from these\ndifferent stages and found that it's far\nmore likely to for people to report a\ndream he wondered what the consequence\nwould be if you selectively deprive\npeople of this stage of sleep of dream\nsleep so he brought individuals into his\nlaboratory and every time they would go\ninto REM sleep they would go into the\nroom they would wake them up have them\ndo some mathematical problems for 2 or 3\nminutes and then put them back asleep\nand they go back into nonr and then as\nsoon as they went back into REM they\nwould wake them up again and the first\nnight they would have to go into the\nroom maybe six or seven times still\nbrutal for the uh for the person in the\nexperiment not not too much fun and but\nby the end of the 5 days or six days I\nthink they were going back into the room\nsomething like 17 18 times why because\nthe people were building up this growing\nREM sleep debt and the Brain had such a\nhunger for it that by Night five of no\nsleep all it wanted to do was rock it\ninto this thing called REM sleep and\nstart devouring it with high volume but\nthat wasn't the interesting part the\ninteresting part was the consequence to\nthese subjects they were all well\nadjusted perfectly normal individuals by\nabout day three of selective R sleep\ndeprivation they started to show signs\nof paranoia they started to believe\npeople were out after them they started\nto have hallucinate ations and delusions\nand by day\nfive they were bordering on having you\nknow aspects of quite severe\npsychosis and so what all of this\nresearch has taught us in some ways is\nthat it's almost as though REM sleep and\nagain it's\nhyperbolic is the difference between\nsanity versus Insanity it's the thing\nthat separates those two and there's a\nwonderful quote from an American uh\nentrepreneur called e Joseph Cosman and\nfor all of the years of work that we've\nbeen doing in this field and I I've\nspilled so much ink over this including\nin the the book he summarized it in a\nsingle\nsentence the best bridge between Despair\nand hope is a good night of sleep and\nthat's exactly what the data is\ndemonstrating in terms of basic\nemotional brain\nfunction so a powerful link there and um\nI think it's appropriate therefore if we\nexplore a little bit about what the link\nactually consists of um in a way that\nwill provide people a a kind of a a\ncompass for when they're feeling a\nlittle bit less emotionally regulated or\nif they would like to improve their\nlevels of emotion regulation uh this is\ngoing to be a little bit of an\nexploration but uh you may recall this\nis an exploration that you and I had\nsome years ago when we were talking\nabout the Rel relationship between rapid\neye movement sleep and\nemotionality\nand here you've described that the\nmedial prefrontal cortex normally plays\nthis kind of\nsh role uh this suppressive role over\nthe amydala under conditions where there\nis something to consider is it averse is\nit not averse how averse is it right\num but in terms of what we know about\nstress and emotion you the autonomic\nnervous system this incredible system\nthat balances sympathetic meaning\nalertness arousal sometimes called the\nfight ORF flight system and\nparasympathetic activation sometimes\ncalled the rest and digest system it's\nthe balance of the two that dictates\none's emotional state and alertness um\nlevel of stress Etc and I've always\nimagined the autonomic nervous system\nthe sympathetic and parasympathetic\nnervous system as sort of a seesaw yeah\nbut on this seesaw sits us right and we\ncan move back and forth across this\nseesaw but there's an component of the\nSeesaw that um in my mental model um\nwhich is the hinge how tight the Seesaw\nis meaning how easily or how challenging\nit is to tilt the Seesaw to one or the\nother side and I don't know if the\nmechanism has been discovered but I feel\nlike what happens under conditions of\nREM deprivation or sleep\ndeprivation that is sleep deprivation\nbut you've beautifully described how\nit's REM deprivation in particular that\ncan do this that the hinge becomes loose\nbut the hinge doesn't become loose\ntoward us becoming more parasympathetic\nand relax there's an asymmetry there\nit's as if the Seesaw now wants to flop\nto sympathetic activation until we're so\nexhausted that we just disappear into\nsleep so the question is this and maybe\nall we have here is is uh opportunity\nfor speculation but is there any\nunderstanding of what the hinge might be\nand how sleep would adjust the tightness\nof that hinge and if people are\nfollowing this what we're really trying\nto get to is you know you described a\nneural circuit mechanism within the\nbrain but is this for instance the\ngating of the release of epinephrine\nadrenaline and cortisol I mean is that I\ncould imagine that's regulated by the\nbrain but when we're deprived of REM\nsleep that process becomes less poorly\ngated and then we just will punch out a\nbunch of adrenaline in response to you\nknow a phone call from a close friend\nthat you adore but is their voic is just\na little bit loud and like H this is\nrough yeah Etc do we do we understand\nthe nature of the hinge we do a little\nbit and it's something that we started\noff trying to test with one specific um\nbelief and then we were beautifully\ncourse corrected by the data we thought\nthat the hinge was going to be once you\nwere sleep deprived and you started to\nslide down into that fight or flight\nBranch the more sympathetic and away\nfrom the the par sympathetic that the\nhinge would get ever tighter the further\ninto that sympathetic stress related\nfight ORF flight dip that you had and\nthere you would stay it wasn't quite\nthat simple what we found was that when\nI challenge you or put you either under\na very simple cardiovascular challenge\nlet's say I'm just having you grip a bar\nfor a long period of time or we have you\nunder some other maybe even if it's a um\nan exercise regiment\nwhen you are in a sleep deprived State\nand you are largely inert and not\ninteracting with the world you actually\nare in a more strong parasympathetic\nState it's almost as though you do not\nwant to interact with the world per se\nand this comes on to\nmotivation we and others have found that\none of the earliest and strongest\neffects of a lack of sleep is just\nabsence of motivation I don't want to\ninteract with the world I don't want to\nbe social I don't want to learn I don't\nwant to exert effort I don't want to\nexercise I just don't want to do much of\nanything however when you provoke me and\nyou force me to interact or there is a\nvery strong emotional event that I\nexperience I go all the way over into\nthe strongly sympathetic so it's almost\nas though we had the prediction that it\nwas going to be a very tight hinge and\nthe screw was tightening the more\nsympathetic you became it was much more\nthat you were in this sort of\nparasympathetic State this sort of\nnon-motivational state and the the hinge\nwas so loose however that even just the\ntiniest flick of a challenge whoosh you\nwent straight over to the sympathetic\nthere was no sweet spot of a tightening\nwhere you were nicely balancing between\nthose two states and this comes back to\nsomething else that we found that's you\nswitching flip-flopping back and forth\nbetween parasympathetic and\nsympathetic I spoke about the emotional\nreactivity to negative aversive events\nbut that's only one half of what we call\nthe affective veilance domain it's not\njust that you can have negative\nemotional reactions of course you can\nhave positive emotional\nreactions so we did a sister study to\nthat amigdala study and we asked rather\nthan showing you increasingly negative\nimages and how your amigdala would\nrespond much more strongly to those as\nwe provoked it we then started to show\nyou much more positive rewarding images\nand because one hypothesis would be that\nyou just simply slide down the scale and\nyou move towards more negative and away\nfrom more reward-based\nreactivity or you could imagine that\nit's both that when you are sleep\ndeprived you are equally excessively\nreactive to both of those domains and\nwhat we found was that it was the latter\nthat you were very abnormally reactive\noverreactive to negative events but you\nwere equally hyper sensitive to very\nreward-based stimuli and this fits\nbeautifully with what we know from sleep\ndeprivation you are much more impulsive\nyou are much more reward seeking you are\nmuch greater in terms of your sensation\nseeking and your addiction potential\nwhen you are not getting sufficient\nsleep is significantly higher and sure\nenough when we looked in the brain many\nof these dopamine related circuits that\nyou've described before were\noveractive when you were under slapped\nand so I bring this back because it\nrelates to your seesaw sort of analogy\nyes you can think about the Seesaw from\nwith sleep deprivation from a\nsympathetic parasympathetic you can also\nthink about it from a positive versus\nnegative veilance and once again our\nhypothesis was that you're just going to\nslide down into the negative and you're\njust going to be less responsive to the\nrewarding positive it was the opposite\nyou were abnormally and excessively\nsensitive to both of the those domains\nwhich you could argue is perhaps the\nvery worst of all adaptive responses\nabsolutely as an organism you don't want\nto be non-reactive emotions are powerful\nand we've spoken about the benefits you\nneed to have emotions to be a\nfunctioning human being or organism in\nthe world they are designed to\nadaptively help us survive but you can't\ngo to the extremes that's maladaptive\nrather than adaptive but that's where\nyou go when you are sleep to Pride\nit's this loose hinge and you become\nvery very erratically and extremely\nreactive from a neural\nperspective yeah my understanding is\nthat um you know sleep deprivation\ndefinitely increases impulsivity and\naddictive potential it's um yes so best\nworst of Both Worlds in this case and\nand given that um now would probably be\nan appropriate time to just um cue\npeople to some of the things that they\ncan do to improve or maximize their\nrapid eye movement sleep this was\ncovered in detail in episodes one and\ntwo um and to some extent in episodes uh\nthree and four as well but they're in\nreference to um to other things um\nlearning memory creativity the role of\nnaps Etc and I'll refer people back to\nthis um beautiful formula uh q qrt that\nit's not just about getting enough sleep\nit's about the quantity indeed but also\nthe quality QQ regularity and timing of\nsleep and knowing one's chronotype that\nis the best time to go to bed and the\nbest time to wake up in the morning for\nthem is going to be critical here and\nand I can raise my hand I'll raise both\nhands in fact uh metaphorically and say\nthat when\nI've gone to sleep early and woken up\nearly so for me 8:30 9 p.m. and then\nwaking up at 4:35 a.m. which for me\nmatches my chronotype\nuh it has served as a powerful\nanti-depressant effect and when I've\ngotten an equal amount of sleep but\ngoing to bed too late for me that is you\nknow midnight 1 a.m. and sleeping in\nuntil 8: or 9:00 a.m. um I always carry\na low-level depression um fortunately\nnot something that needed to be uh\nmedicated but uh it's it's a striking\neffect in the positive direction when\nobeying qqr and in in the negative\nDirection when not so maybe just for\nbecause we can provide some links to um\nthose segments in the show note captions\nbut maybe just um for people that are\nhere now um if we were going to list out\nyou know two or three things that one\ncan do to try and maximize um the\nquality and quantity of REM sleep uh\nwithout going on too much of a tangent\nbut um at the same time we do want to\nhighlight that addressing that Q qrt\nformula um for ourselves is going to be\ncritical so maybe so for REM sleep um\nyeah you know in the domain of exercise\ntemperature Etc are there any kind of\nquick quick bullet points that we can\nrefer people to I would say just to keep\nit high level and and brief the single\nbest way\ncheapest non-pharmacological way that\nyou can enhance your REM sleep is to\njust sleep an extra 15 or 20 minutes\nlater into the morning don't try to put\nif I tell you this is about by the way\nthis is about the the quantity the your\nsleep\nopportunity don't try to add that 30\nminutes or 20 minutes if your goal is to\nincrease real sleep at the start of the\nnight at the front end instead take that\ndesire that I've offered you of adding\njust 20 minutes or 25 minutes of extra\nsleep now to the last part of your night\nwake up that sort of much later 20 25\nminutes later\nthat's the REM sleep Rich phase so if\npeople go back and listen to episode one\nwe'll describe to you exactly how the\ndifferent stages of sleep unfold across\nthe night and they're not evenly\ndistributed it's not as though you get\njust as much REM sleep as well as deep\nnon-rem sleep in the first half of the\nnight as you do in the second you get\nmost of your deep sleep in the first\nhalf and you get most of your REM sleep\nin the second half and particularly in\nthe last quarter of the night and this\nleads us to understand that the later\ninto the morning hours that we go the\ngreater the hunger preference and The\nTaste desire there is of your brain to\nstart sampling from the finger Buffet of\nall of those different stages this thing\ncalled REM sleep and the later that you\nsleep into the morning the more of that\nREM sleep that you will have and many\npeople will have experienced this at the\nweekend where they have this pattern\nthat we don't Rec recommend based on the\nqqr T um QQ our regularity go to bed at\nthe same time wake up at the same time\nwhat we see often in society is\nsomething what we call social jetl where\nyou're short sleeping during the week\nand then at the weekend you're out with\nfriends or you're out sort of on the\ntown you go to bed late and you wake up\nlate and maybe you're doing that by 2\nhours maybe you're normally in bed by\n10: p.m. during the week but now at the\nweekends you're going to sleep maybe 12\n12:30 and you're waking up 2 3 hours\nlater on a Saturday and Sunday and then\nthe problem with that parenthetically is\non Sunday evening you've now got to go\nback to work the next day so you have to\npush yourself back to 10:30 or 10:00\nwhereas you were going to bed let's say\nat 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday night\nthat's a 3-hour Time shift and people\nare doing that very frequently that's\nthe equivalent of you and I flying back\nand forth from Los Angeles to New York\nevery single weekend in terms of oaan\nRhythm and it's brutal on it but this is\nseparate from this notion of your timing\nthe final part of the Q qrt and by\npushing your timing a little bit later\ninto the morning when you wake up you\nwill experience more REM sleep and as I\nsaid when people sleep later they go to\nbed later at night and they wake up much\nlater in the morning at the weekend I\nstrongly suspect that if they paid\nattention they would say at weekends I\nalways dream more I always can remember\nmy dreams and they're more intense it's\nnot because there's something magical\nabout how your memory recollection of\nDreams operates on Saturdays and Sundays\nit's because you've slept in later\nyou've gone into that REM sleep Rich\npreferential phase in the morning and\ntherefore you've increased your REM\nsleep so I would say that that's\nprobably the easiest way that you can\nstart to modulate REM sleep so that's a\nterrific do and um I think we can\nprobably summarize the the top don't as\nuh don't drink alcohol because it\nabolishes REM sleep alcohol and THC are\nboth very potent ways that will remove\nor obliterate your REM sleep and we\nspoke about this in the episode on um on\nTHC when we discussed this I think just\nyesterday I got a very long email and\nyou know I'm sure you get lots of emails\nfrom um from delightful people in the\npublic and a Gentleman just saying you\nknow I was using cannabis for probably\nabout 7 years and then I watched um or\nlisten to some of your content and I\nstopped and I just had this\nexplosion of dreams and I was never\nrecollecting any of my dreams before but\nnow they came back and goodness were\nthey Vivid they were Rich they were and\nI could not believe it and that's REM\nsleep and that's because during the kind\nuse by way of the THC not the CBD you've\nbeen blocking that REM sleep you've\nbuilt up that pressure just as we\ndescribed in the dementi these and then\nwhen you finally do take away the agent\nthat is blocking the generation of REM\nsleep the THC all of a sudden your brain\ndoesn't just go back to having its\nstandard amount of REM sleep and\ndreaming it has that plus it tries to\nget back as much of it as it possibly\ncan by having what we call a REM sleep\nrebound and that's why people when they\nthey stop using they end up having this\nintense real sleep by the way to your\npoint about reward and um addiction\nsensitivity with sleep deprivation one\nof the things that we um we did in a\ncollaboration gosh this was years ago\nwhen I was at Harvard with Carl Hart who\nI think you I don't know if you colia\nyeah Colombia you know him yeah he's\nfantastic researcher very interesting\nman too um and what we found was that a\nlack of sleep was not only predictive of\nyour addiction potential but when you\nwent into a clinic to abstain and trying\nto come off some of those and here we\nwere looking at cocaine um addiction a\nlack of sleep was a strong predictor of\nyour abstinence and you falling off the\nwagon and going back to you so sleep is\nso critical not just for um maintaining\nor pushing you away from that addiction\npotential but once you are addicted and\nyou're trying to abstain it gives you\nthat lift of altitude to try to resist\nfalling off the wagon and when sleep\ngets short that's when you become\nvulnerable again probably because your\nreward circuitry becomes enhanced and\nall of a sudden you just cannot resist\nthe temptation anymore I want to take a\nbrief break and acknowledge our sponsor\ninsid tracker insid tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA a\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals now\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason the many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test the problem with a\nlot of blood tests out there however is\nthat you get information back about\nmetabolic factors hormones Etc but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy to understand your\nresults and they also point you to\nspecific directives that you can follow\nin the realm of nutrition exercise\nsupplementation a even prescription\ndrugs that can help bring the levels\nback into the ranges that are optimal\nfor you insid tracker also offers insid\nTracker Pro

Emotional\nSelf that is in order to be able to\naccess positive emotions to their full\namplitude uh motivation um learning as\nwe also covered in a previous episode\nbut also to stay out of those um\nirritable emotional traps of life um and\nto be a regulated person calm and and\njoyful person um it stands to reason to\nuh minimize alcohol and cannabis use\nunless there's some I don't know medical\nreason why uh someone should otherwise\nbut the the real take-home message here\nis get as much rapid eye movement sleep\nas possible and don't do anything to\ninhibit it yeah get as much sleep so\nfocus on all of those four uh macros of\nsleep quantity quality regularity and\ntiming and notice that if you want to\ntry to optimize some of those that\nemotional reactivity and balance you may\nwant to slightly over index on your REM\nsleep in that regard and one easy cheap\nway of doing that if you can lifestyle\npermitting an and again of course I\nunderstand everyone is has a life to\nlive and pressures but that's the way\nthat if you were to ask me can you do it\nand do it simply yes you probably can\ngreat but you touched on trauma a little\nbit already but um now would be the\nappropriate time I think to talk about\nPTSD post-traumatic stress disorder\nwhich um I think we can use the\ndefinition of PTSD and Trauma that the\ngreat Paul kti a former guest on this\npodcast who also did series\nyeah an incredible man what a what a\nwhat a mind on him and what a generosity\nof of sharing information in clear ways\nabout mental health as he did in the\nfour episode series on Mental Health\nhere and he's been on other podcasts as\nwell wrote A M marvelous book on trauma\nPaul defined trauma as some event that\nis aversive that changes the way that\nour nervous system works such that we\nfunction less well in the future it's\nnot that every negative event\nevery uh negative emotion Associated\nmemory is trauma I think that's a a\nmisconception um but there are things\nthat happen to people um or that they\nobserve happening to other people so\nthere's you know first person trauma\nthird person observational trauma Etc\nand these can be single events multiple\nevents you know sadly this stuff happens\num it can be neglect so sometimes it's\nthe absence of an event right which\nbecomes the traumatic event that\nfundamentally rewire some component of\nneur neural circuitry such that we don't\nfunction as well in terms of\nrelationship to anything work food sex\nsleep relationships uh Baseline levels\nof emotionality and on and on so what is\nthe relationship between sleep and\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nspecifically I think some of what we've\ncovered already certainly touches on\nthis but PTSD seems to me that it it\nmight be its own unique case\nit is because if you look at the\ndiagnostic criteria for\nPTSD firstly you see sleep disturbance\nand as I said right at the top of this\nepisode there is no major psychiatric\ndisorder where there isn't some mention\nof sleep problems in its diagnostic\ncriteria but something else was\nintriguing about PTSD that compelled me\nto think about it and then create a\ntheory around it it's not just sleep\nproblems it's also\nnightmares and specifically repetitive\nnightmares in fact repetitive nightmares\nform part of the diagnostic criteria for\nyou to receive a diagnosis of PTSD\nthat's how reliable they\nare and as I thought more about this\nmodel of overnight therapy this notion\nthat sleep and particularly REM sleep\nprovides a form of emotional first\naid PTSD stood out to me as something\nthink that I had to return to to explain\nwhy because if you think about PTSD and\na veteran it is the perfect example of\nthe process that I described of\nemotional deep potentiation\nfailing because what I started to\nrealize is that in PTSD there is this\ntrauma\nexperience and then perhaps what's\nhappening is that sleep the brain goes\nback to sleep that night and says okay\nplease do your elegant trick of\nstripping away the emotion from the\nmemory and it fails so then what happens\nthe next night the brain comes back and\nsays I'm sorry but I still got this very\nemotionally charged memory please do\nyour elegant dissipation depotentiation\nof the emotion from memory and it fails\nagain almost like this broken record\nthat was so indicative of these\nrepetitive\nnightmares and then when you looked at\nPTSD I told you that REM sleep is a time\nof this remarkable decrease in\nnoradrenaline but if you look at PTSD\npatients they actually have heightened\nlevels of neur adrenaline and also in\nthe body adrenaline as well in sleep in\nsleep and also when you look just as a\nbasil State as well so there's something\nnot quite right with the noradrenaline\nstory in REM sleep in PTSD patients so I\nhad just published this paper and I was\nup um at a conference in I think it was\nPortland and I presented the theory that\nor the data that we had on healthy\npeople and I put forward this theory of\num of PTSD and then later that afternoon\na psychiatrist came on uh the stage\ncalled Murray Raskin and he was working\na lot with PTSD\nvets and he describe data which I\ncouldn't believe it's one of those\nmoments Andrew where you're at a\nscientific\nconference and I think it happens maybe\nonce in a career if you're lucky all of\nthe hers on the back of my neck stood on\nSharp end because he was saying we've\ngot this data and we don't quite\nunderstand it we've been treating our\nveterans for blood pressure for\nhypertension using a generic drug called\nprasin and prasin blocked\nthe um adrenergic response in the body\nbecause you're trying to sort of Tamp\ndown that sympathetic activation in the\nbody beta blocker so it's an it's an\nalpha\nadrenergic antagonist not a beta blocker\nso it's not a beta blocker but it's\nblocking the adrenergic\nsystem and so and it's a you know it's a\ngeneric pretty cheap drug but it turns\nout that it crosses the blood brain\nbarrier so it doesn't just stay within\nthe body it goes up into the brain and\nhe said we don't really understand it\nbecause I've been giving patients this\nmedication and it works to a degree but\nsomething else happens they come into\nthe clinic and they say Doc I'm not\nhaving those nightmares anymore they\nseem to have gone away and these\npatients seem to start to show signs of\nresolution so all of a sudden I had had\na model a clinical model that was in\nsearch of data and he had data that was\nin search of a theoretical\nmodel I couldn't believe it because it's\nexactly what I would predict which is\nthat if neur adrenaline is too high in\nPTSD you're not processing and stripping\nthe emotion from the memory so it keeps\ncoming back over and over like this\nrepetitive nightmare but then if you\nblock and help bring back down that\nlevel of neur adrenaline to that which\nwould be seen in a normal healthy person\nin other words completely blocking it or\nall of a sudden the emotional memory\ngets the chance to be processed and you\nfinally start to get symptom resolution\nso we couldn't believe it he flew down\nto Berkeley we spent several days\ntogether we went out to dinner we just\ncould not stop talking he subsequently\ndid some incredible work in this area\nand presin went on to become the um an\nFDA approved medication for PTSD and\nrepetitive nightmares that was approved\nby the Veterans Administration Bravo and\nso no it's not me it's all all of his\nwork no you can't no this to me is the\nuh scientific collaborative um\nconceptual equivalent of the old rees's\num peanut butter cup commercials for\nthose of us old enough to remember it's\ntwo people running toward one another on\nthe beach one with a jar of peanut\nbutter one with a with a piece with a\nbar of chocolate and then they crash\ninto one another and then they both you\nknow share in the Delight of the the\nchocolate peanut butter combination\nwhich is an amazing combination um but\nhere a far more um important example uh\nbecause it's led to a clinical relief in\nin patients with PTSD um so I'm not\nmaking light of that at all but um this\nis one of the reasons to go to\nScientific meetings seriously this is\none of the reasons why scientists need\nto talk this is one of the reasons to do\npodcasts is it is it uh Fosters\nhybridization of ideas which um is\nCentral to to new discoveries um and in\nthis case a clinical Discovery I I have\na question about um this notion of\nblocking norepinephrine um in the brain\nand body um you know on the one hand it\nseems that during rapid eye movement\nsleep we know we're paralyzed um or we\nare paralyzed that's a fact of rapid eye\nmovement sleep the um the brain is\nrecalling memories often in in great\ndetail sometimes through symbolic\nrepresentation SpaceTime is disrupted\nit's either faster or slower so because\nyou're dreaming um and\nit seems that there's something powerful\nabout being able to replay the\nmemories and yet divorce them from\ncertain\nneurochemical uh release in the brain\nand body to essentially uncouple them\nand then to me it makes perfect sense\nwhy taking a a drug that would reduce\nthe amount of sympathetic arousal in\nsleep would help especially PTSD because\nyou said with\nPTSD sort of an invasion of the\nnoradrenaline response into rapid ey\nMoon sleep that is inappropriate so does\nthat mean that rapid eye movement sleep\nin people with PTSD is not truly rapid\neye movement sleep it's as if it's been\nabolished and replaced with something\nthat's kind of pseudo waking stress\ninvaded you know it's like a zombie REM\num and it's not good is that is that is\nthat correct it seems to be an and you\ncan look at this in terms of the\nelectrical activity of REM sleep the\nelectrical brain waves of R sleep in\nthese patients and you're right it\ndoesn't seem to be of the same\nelectrical quality but what was\ninteresting in Marie Raskin studies when\nhe started to treat patients with the\npricin and Tamp down that\nnoradrenaline one of the other things\nthat returned back to normality was not\njust that the symptoms dissipated their\nREM sleep started to return with a\ngreater amount and so I think it fits\nvery well with this notion that whatever\nREM sleep that was going on may not\nnecessarily have been electrical or\nneurochemically identical to normative\nREM sleep but when you assisted the\nsystem with a chemical to bring it back\ninto normality REM sleep was gifted back\nto the brain and emotional resolution\nstarted to unfold now I should note that\nthere have been um a number of studies\nthat have replicated the finding some\nStudies have not though and so we still\nneed to understand exactly why this is\nthe case and there are other therapies\nthat we'll probably discuss in a later\nepisode on dreaming that are as if not\nmore effective than that drug therapy\nfor repetitive nightmares that is a\npsychological intervention rather than a\npharmacological intervention and that\nseems to be very effective too in 2017\nas my laboratory was starting to explore\nsome studies on humans on fear and\nTrauma I visited a a trauma Addiction\nCenter on the East Coast um the guy who\nruns it will be a guest on this podcast\nin the future\nan amazingly talented uh trauma and\naddiction therapist by the name of Ryan\nSuave and there it\nwas that I learned about Yoga Nidra\nnon-sleep deep rest and here's why they\nwere taking heroin addicts gambling\naddicts sex addicts alcoholics people\nwith what they're call behavioral\nprocess addictions and substance abuse\naddictions um and every morning after\nthey woke up the first thing that they\nwould do was 1 hour of non-sleep deep\nbre you know placing people into this\nlinal state and I asked why and um and\nRyan said this is especially important\nto do with um addicts when they arrive\nin inpatient recovery in the first week\nand um even more so in the first three\ndays because typically they are badly\nsleep\ndeprived and in addition to that many of\nthem are just not good at getting and\nstaying asleep at night without the use\nof pharmacology or in some cases their\nbehavioral addictions depending on what\nit what it was\nand so it was a a kind of a\nself-directed relaxation training of\nsorts uh first thing in the morning that\nin addition um perhaps could compensate\npartially for some of the sleep\ndeprivation that they no doubt were\nexperiencing when they arrived it's also\nnovel environment and sleeping novel\nenvironments can be challenging so uh\nthere is as far as I know no uh\nrandomized control Trials of of this\npractice uh yet but there are a good\nnumber of um clinics and treatment\ncenters that are now employing non-sleep\ndeep breast AKA Yoga Nidra um for 30\nminutes to an hour first thing upon\nwaking um as one of the you know core\ncomponents of treatment for helping\npeople get and stay sober I think it's\nabsolutely fascinating because that\nmorning time period as well can be for\nthose who are struggling with sleep\nespecially difficult and you and I have\nspoken on this podcast series about sort\nof Awakening at night or later in the\nmorning when you really want to be\nasleep and it's just a struggle to get\nback and as you noted there he was\nsaying they often come in underslept and\nmy suspicion is that they're probably\ngetting sleep at the front end in part\nbecause they're heavily medicated but\nself-medicating in terms of helping\ntheir sleep but then of course because\nthey are asleep they can't continue to\nmedicate so which part of sleep is\nfragile it's those morning hours and\ntherefore if you have something that is\na compensatory tool that is not going to\nbe the trigger of saying just get back\ninto bed get under those sheets and\nsleep you know sleep doesn't work like\nthat sleep is not something that we do\nsleep is something that arrives to us\nwith us and if it's not you can't force\nit and it's not it's a little bit like\nsomeone's name in fact quite the\nopposite that the harder you try to\nremember the further you push sleep away\nand when you stop it all of a sudden\ncomes back but I love this idea of\ninserting something like that as a\ncompensatory tool and that's why I think\nyou and I have discussed um openly here\nin fact on this series at some point\nwe're going to collaborate and we're\ngoing to look to see exactly what is\nhappening electrically at High Fidelity\nmapping inside of the brain when we are\ngoing through these linal states and\nwhat is the benefit of that is it a very\nsimilar benefit for sleep and it's\nfascinating because it's Poss possible\nthat what we find at the level of the\nbrain is that it's not sleep like it's\nsomething else like maybe it's just a\nLial State like and what's also\ninteresting is that it provides\nseemingly many of the benefits of sleep\nbut it's not sleep in other words you\ncan arrive at the same destination of\nmental and physical health through two\ndifferent routs one thing called Sleep\none thing called these lional states or\nthey both op operate on the same Highway\nin terms of mechanistic transaction\nbenefits there's so much that we\nneed we could stay here all all night\nand all day hopefully not all night well\nwell we will absolutely do those studies\nand um because I think that people are\nin desperate need of zero cost tools to\ntry and um access the the the\nreplenishment and Recovery that comes\nfrom sleep and when sleep is available\nto us when we can access it that's going\nto be the best option there's no\nquestion but then some of these tools um\nin theory and in practice provide a a\nportal to get better at sleeping as well\nso I was going to say one of the other\nthings I I'd be fascinated for us to do\nis not just look at that model of what\nhappens in the morning but can we use\nthat for people who have the opposite\ninsomnia problem which is that I can't\nfall asleep and we spoke about this in a\nprevious episode of tools and techniques\nand methods to help you fall asleep\ncould this be one of them where you just\nstart to help move yourself into this\nLial State you take the stress off one\nof the things I hear so much at the\ncenter when people come in and they say\nI've just I always struggle to sleep and\nyou go into depth and it's because they\ntheir mind starts to roll it X through\nthat anxiety of what I need to do and\nwhat I should do but also then the the\nlater it gets and the the absent the\nSleep becomes the more stress they get\nnot just about the next day The more\nstress that they get about this thing\ncalled not being able to fall asleep and\nif there's something a practice that\nyou've taught someone that says that's\nokay I know this place and I know this\nsituation and there's a tool I have and\nit's\ncalled this ainal state and if you were\nto train people on that sort of that\nmethod is it a way that they finally can\nthen cast themselves\noff and it's the it's the bridge not\nnecessarily just between Despair and\nhope but the bridge between wakefulness\nand sleep so put it at the back end at\nthe end of the day rather than the front\nend a lot for us to discover there and\num you know at risk of of uh being\nhyperbolic I mean what what would be\nmore useful than a zeroc cost\nnon-pharmacologic tool for people to get\num the rest and restoration they need\nand to get better at getting the\nultimate form of rest and restoration\nwhich is sleep yeah and it you know I\nlove the Paradox of it that non-sleep\ndeep rest allows you to go into sleep\ndeep rest right it is after all a\ntransition or Lial State maybe this will\nbecome the the stage before stage one of\nsleep who knows who knows we Define off\nstage in criteria that's right okay so\nspeaking of challenges sleeping because\nof one's concern AKA anxiety about the\nimportance of sleep what about the\nrelationship between sleep and anxiety\nmeaning many people in the world\nexperience low-level anxiety or have a\nlow threshold to what could be a\nfull-blown anxiety or panic attack but\nmore often than not is this feeling of\nbeing tired and wired or um having a a\nquick uh you know prepulse startle as we\ncall it in our business a nerd speak for\num you know kind of a reactive um to\ninput anxiety and I don't think there's\nany clean definition between anxiety\nstress um and PTSD these run along a\nContinuum and they PSD is an anxiety\ndisorder it's one of many right they\nthese things braid together in a way\nthat it would be a waste of our time to\ntry and disentangle those um but many\npeople have anxiety that is anywhere\nfrom minor to debilitating um but that\nis separate from PTSD although people\nwith PTSD can have\nanxiety so what do we know about the\nrelationship between\nsleep and anxiety and perhaps we could\nframe this in the context of the\nqqr you know um I'll just toss out a\nquestion that perhaps highlights what I\nmean is it possible that somebody's\ngetting eight hours of sleep a night\nwhich for them meets their quantity\nrequirement in the um the quality\nis relatively high but it's not as high\nas it could be because the regularity\nand timing of their sleep isn't great is\nthat person going to be more prone to\nanxiety than somebody who's really\nmatched to their chronotype and is still\ngetting enough sleep no one's done the\nhead-to-head comparison where you kind\nof do the how I going do the Coke Pepsi\nDr Pepper Sprite QQ RT challenge between\nall of those what we do know is that if\nyou look at each one independently qqr T\nquantity quality regularity timing if\nany one of those is off it's very\ndifficult not to see a coexisting anxiet\ndisorder or increase in anxiety or a\nmood disorder and I think to me anxiety\nis part of that class of a broader class\nthat I would call mood\ndisorders it's relevant that we make\nthat distinction at least in my eyes and\nI know some people may disagree because\nmood and anxiety are different than\nemotions and many of us Clump them\ntogether the way I think about the\ndifference is the following time scale\nemot ions are short punctate events that\nusually last anywhere from seconds to\ntoo many minutes mood States however\nlike anxiety or depression those operate\non a slightly different time scale from\nminutes to hours to months to years and\nso it's very unlikely that we can\nexperience an emotional reaction that\nfrom a sort of a chronometry point of\nview lack lasts for 2 years but you can\ncertainly see someone who has a mood\nState abnormality of depression that\nlasts for several years or who has been\nchronically anxious for several years\nand I'll come back to why I think that\ndistinction is is relevant for a second\nto your point though about the\nrelationship with sleep here again it's\na very strong bidirectional relationship\nand I would say that probably in the\nlast eight or nine years we've been\ndoing a considerable amount of work can\nsleep in anxiety rather than just sleep\nin basic emotional\nreactivity what we found is it's very\nstrongly\nbidirectional that if you have anxiety\nit's very difficult to sleep and if you\nare having difficulty sleeping it's very\nlikely that you will increase your\nanxiety but before we really unpacked\nthat we started with a a very basic\nstudy similar to those we've described\nwe took a group of people and we were\nvery careful to make sure that they had\num completely normative levels of\nanxiety they showed no signs of an\nanxiety related disorder and by the way\nanxiety disorders are it seems one of if\nnot the most common of all psychiatric\nconditions just to put it in context for\npeople listening and these individuals\nno signs of anxiety disorders whatsoever\nthey were normative and then we had them\ngo through a full night of sleep or we\nthen sleep deprived them and the next\nday we were measuring their anxiety and\nin those people who were sleep deprived\nwe were actually measuring the level of\nanxiety every hour so we could almost\nget this timelapse photography of what\nhappened to the anxiety state as it\nunfolded across the sleep deprivation\nperiod it wasn't a linear response that\nthe more and more hours that you were\nawake Beyond\n16 the more exponential\nthat rise in anxiety became so it wasn't\nsimply a linear dose response curve it\nwas an exponential meaning that there\nwas this hockey shaped swing up and in\nfact by the next morning compared to\nwhen you'd had a full night of sleep\nthose individuals were so anxious that\nalmost 50% of the participants in that\ngroup who had no signs of anxiety before\nhad a level of anxiety that was so\nstrong that they would reach the\ndiagnostic threshold for having an\nanxiety disorder and that was simply by\nway of the absence of\nsleep but again that brought me back to\nthis notion of this is a good\nexperimental tool for us scientists to\nunderstand what is the benefit of sleep\nwhen it's present and the absence of\nsleep when it's not by taking sleep\ncompletely out of the equation by way of\ntotal deprivation but of course that's\nnot real life so we did a slightly\ndifferent study\nhere what we did was we tracked\nindividuals essentially in the wild as\nit were just going about their daily\nlives and we had different sleep\ntracking monitor uh monitoring equipment\non them so we were tracking their sleep\nfrom one night to the next to the next\nto the next and from one day to the next\nto the next we were tracking their level\nof anxiety and what we found here was\nthat even small perturbations in their\nsleep from one night to the next to the\nnext\naccurately predicted the increase or\ndecrease in their anxiety from one day\nto the next to the next what was the\ncritical ingredient here well in the\nfirst experiment I'd essentially\nmanipulated both quantity and quality\nthe two qqs of the qqr had removed the\nquantity of sleep and also they had no\nquality of sleep why because they had no\nquantity of sleep but when we looked at\nthat day to day to day night to night\ntoight study it wasn't quantity that was\nthe best predictor it wasn't shortening\nof quantity that determined next day\nincreases in anxiety it was quality the\nworse the quality was night to night to\nnight the worse their anxiety\nbecame so that started to lead us to\nthink a lot more about what is it\nregarding the quality of sleep that\nseemed to offer when it was present what\nI would describe as an angio itic\nbenefit in other words it's lessening\nanxiety a lack of sleep is an anxiogenic\nit's going to produce anxiety what in\nsleep is\nanxiolytic we started off with a\nhypothesis that was profoundly incorrect\nwe thought well for emotions which are\nthese short bursts of um of affective\nstate it was REM sleep that seemed to be\nthe Principal ingredient well wouldn't\nthat be the case for mood States well\nhere with anxi it wasn't it was deep\nnon-rm sleep and we couldn't get away\nfrom it and so what we found was that\nwhen we looked at the sleep in the\nlaboratory and asked what was predictive\nfrom the night before so you measure\nyour anxiety the night before and then\nwe measure it the next morning and\nbasically we calculate a change score\nhas your anxiety the next morning\nincreased stayed the same or decreased\nand then we correlate that with the\ndifferent stages and what we found was\nthat the electrical quality of your deep\nnonrem sleep was very much\npredictive of your dissipation of\nanxiety\novernight and this helped me realize\ngosh it's much more complex these are\nbeautiful surprises you get from\nresearch when you you have like you have\nthis hypothesis and you look at you see\nREM sleep no signal of predictive\nrelationship with anxiety and I say of\ncourse because I'm idiotic rerun the\nanalysis just go back to Raw data and\nyou know the r sleep signal was so\nstrong rerun the analysis and you get\nexactly the same result it's deep non-rm\nsleep great okay then what is that deep\nnon-rm sleep doing to help dissipate the\nanxiety but here again was a commonality\nwith emotion what we found is that the\ngreater the amount of Deep non-rm Sleep\nthe greater the re-engagement of your\nfrontal lobe was the next day and that\nwas predicting the dissipation of your\nanxiety the next morning so we really\nstarted to understand this sort of\ncritical bidirectional relationship but\nit was a very complex one that yes\nanxiety can disrupt your sleep and yes\ndisrupted sleep can predict your next\nday anxiety but it wasn't the same stage\nof sleep that we thought before it was\nthe the opposite it was deep non-rm\nsleep what we've come to realize is that\ndeep nonr sleep in part seems to be\nalmost shifting you from that\nsympathetic State over to the\nparasympathetic state it seems to engage\nthat nice rest and digest it seems to\nreduce your heart rate it seems to drop\nlevels of cortisol and we think that\nperhaps is a resetting brain body\nliterally an embodied mechanism by way\nof Deep non-r Sleep helping you just\nrelieve that anxiety pressure so it does\ncome back to your question which is yes\nquantity if I manipulated quality if I\nmanipulate regularity or timing\nmanipulate any one of those I can change\nyour anxiety but the story coming\nthrough here if anything was that it\nwasn't quantity it was quality I told\nyou that from one night to the next to\nthe next the quality of your sleep that\nwe were measuring was predictive of your\nanxiety and then when we bring you into\nthe laboratory and we look at the\nelectrical activity of your brain I also\nmentioned in that episode on the first\nepisode another way we measure quality\nis not just subjectively what's going on\nor objectively what is the efficiency of\nyour sleep is it filled with lots of\nAwakenings which was the measure that we\nused in the day-to-day study and night\nto night study but we looked at the\nelectrical quality of your sleep once\nagain it was quality that was predicting\nit it's something about getting good\ncontinuous sleep that is replete with\nthis deep non-rem electrical brain\nactivity that provides an angiolytic\nbenefit to your brain the next day and I\nthink it's strategic CU so many of us\ndeal with\nanxiety and some of us would prefer not\nto necessarily be on medication or even\nlook to that well here again is a\nstrategic tool think about your sleep it\nreally does seem to be a buffer for\nanxiety along those lines maybe you can\njust recap a few of the things covered\nin previous episodes that are known to\nimprove the quality and quantity of Deep\nnonm Sleep\num I can think of a couple but I'm\nyou're the expert here um not rush to\njudgment on that one well I think it's\nan established fact uh which is why\nyou're here um so let's\num perhaps list a few of those off in\nthe domains of you know exercise\ntemperature Etc what what what would you\nplace in that you know is there top\nthree like three greatest hits for uh\nfor improving deep non-rem sleep for uh\nbecause of its important relationship to\nanxiety management or reducing anxiety I\nthink there are the first thing I would\ntell you is that regularity is going to\nbe key here when you are giving your\nbrain the signals of regularity it\nunderstands exactly how to instigate\nthat that deep sleep and that's one of\nthe two qualitative measures of sleep\nthat I spoke about so QQ the quality the\nsecond Q I spoke about it's regarding\nthe continuity of your sleep and the\nelectrical quality of your sleep\nregularity is probably best for the\ncontinuity of your sleep if you're very\nirregular with the timing of your sleep\nyour brain almost doesn't know you know\nare we on are We off are we on and we\noff and your sleep can become quite\nfragmented because it's confused based\non regularity when you give it\nregularity sleep starts to become more\nstable more stable means that it's less\nlikely to be littered with Awakenings\nmeaning that it's better quality of\nsleep in terms of electrical quality of\nsleep we did mention this um in a prior\nepisode when we spoke about sort of food\nand exercise exercise seems to be one of\nthose things that's very good at\nimproving the quality of your deep sleep\nand here I'm talking about the\nelectrical quality of your deep sleep\ntry to make sure that you're physically\nactive to a degree and and I think this\nis a protocol and I think it's a\nmeaningful protocol but to go so to the\nextreme where I would to say you need to\ndo at least 32 and a half minutes on a\nspin bike at this wattage or you know we\ncan't prescribe quite at that point you\nknow scientific prescription not MediCal\nand so I would say exercise is one then\nwe spoke about another which was\ntemperature and we said that getting\nyour bedroom cool seems to be a way to\npromote the increase in deep sleep so\nthese are two dos which is get regular\nget cool the don'ts we've already spoken\na little bit about too one of the things\nthat I probably didn't mention enough\nwith alcohol not only does it seem to\ncompromise your rapid eye movement sleep\nbut it will fragment your sleep it will\nmake your sleep more unstable and an\nindirect consequence of that is alcohol\nis going to be in highest concentrations\nin your system after drinking in the\nevening with sleep in the first four to\n5 hours now that depends on how quickly\nyou metabolize it and how much you've\nhad but let's assume some degree of\nstandardization in other words I said\nthat alcohol will not just block your M\nsleep it will fragment your sleep makes\nyour sleep more vulnerable to you waking\nup well you're especially vulnerable in\nthe first four or so hours because\nthat's when alcohol concentration is\nhighest in your system and therefore the\nfirst 4 hours can also fall prey to the\ngreatest culling of your sleep quality\nand if you're removing or restricting\nsome of that quality in the first four\nhours what type of sleep are you\nprincipally restricting you're\nrestricting deep sleep because we've\nsaid deep sleep comes in the first half\ndream sleep REM sleep in the second half\nso don'ts would be try to stay away from\nyou know excessive alcohol in the\nevening we also know that Al alcohol is\nassociated\nwith longer term chronic anxiety and the\ntragedy is that it's often used as a way\nto blunt the anxiety because alcohol is\na sedative and it can help just\nalleviate take you know take the edge\noff but it's a short-term quote unquote\nwin for a long-term loss because overall\nit will increase anxiety levels so I\nwould say those are some dos and perhaps\na don't if you want to try to optimize\nyour sleep quality quality including the\nIntegrity of your sleep and also the\nelectrical quality of your sleep\nterrific I think um because so many\npeople struggle with anxiety ranging\nfrom mild to severe anxiety the tips you\njust provided are going to be immensely\nbeneficial and in addition to that the\nprevious four episodes that we've\nrecorded for this series each and all\ninclude tools that is protocols for\nimproving the Q qrt aspects of sleep so\num all the more reason for people to uh\ndig into those and and to glean the the\ngems that you've laid out for people\nbecause they're they really are very\nactionable and um you know most all\nperhaps even all of the tools that we've\ndiscussed in those episodes are zero\ncost they require a little bit of time\ninvestment some um thought and\nconsideration but they're not really\nthat difficult to implement they just\nrequire a little bit of um being one's\nown scientist of self and being your own\nown Corner when it comes to sleep and\nanother lowcost method that we um\nmentioned was not just temperature in\nterms of keeping your room cool but warm\nbath or shower before bed I mentioned\nimproved sleep but one of the things\nthat improves most is deep non-r sleep\nso there's another technique get your\nroom cool to go into but warm up to cool\ndown to fall asleep which then keeps you\ncool so that you stay asleep and you'll\nget more deep sleep very\nfantastic although it's a terribly um uh\nunhappy\ntopic suicide is a is an important topic\nfor us to to cover here um you know I\ncan think of few things more tragic than\nsuicide um and yet sadly it U it\naccompanies certain uh psychiatric\nconditions I think um people with manic\nbipolar have a 20 to 30 times greater um\nprobability of suicide than others but\nyou know suicide accompanies major\ndepression anxiety PTSD you know again\nit's it's um a tough topic to to get\ninto um but an important one to get into\nwhat is the relationship between\nsuicidality and sleep um and I suppose\nwe could look at this from the\nperspective of to what degree does sleep\ndeprivation um correlate with suicide or\nattempted suicides and what sort of inoc\nulatory effects does um sleep provide\ntowards\nsuicide unfortunately we don't know much\nabout the second part of the question\nwhich is how can sleep be used as a risk\nmitigating tool when you know that there\nis the risk of suicide in place um\nthere's been a number of people who are\ndoing this work including my colleague\nAllison Harvey again at uh the\nUniversity of uh of California Berkeley\nand Sher Johnson who's also there too I\nwould say though that the first question\nis is quite answerable which is what do\nwe know firstly about how a lack of\nsleep can impact suicide some of the\nearliest data that we found were\nassociational relationships what we\nfound is that short sleep or poor\nquality of sleep predicted three things\nit\npredicted suicidal ideation meaning that\nyou had thoughts of\nsuicide bad sleep seemed to predict\nsuicide attempts and then tragically\nmore recent data a lack of sleep\npredicts suicide\ncompletion and what makes me think more\ncausely about it and we've been trying\nto get some grants and we've failed to\ndo so so far to do more of this work\nbecause I'm I'm just so compelled by it\nand you're right it's one of the most\ntragic\nsituations those sleep relationships\naren't simply happening at the same\nmoment in time what I mean is that the\nsleep disturbance that we see\nprecedes the onset of having suicidal\nthoughts it precedes the onset of\nsuicide attempt and it precedes the\nsuicide completion so what this has been\nteaching me is I've been looking at the\ndata and we've looked at a little bit of\nour own data sleep disruption when it\ncomes to suicide is almost the canary in\nthe coal mine it's almost like a tragic\ncrystal ball that when you see that\nsleep start starting to\ndismantle it is a foreshadowing sign of\na very dark series of events that will\nunfold in other words could we now start\nto think and this is one of the things\nthat we want to do is sleep a biomarker\nis sleep disruption I should say a\nbiomarker for upcoming suicide risk\nbefore it begins the idea of finding a\nbiomarker or collection of biomarkers\nfor SU side I think is one of the more\nimportant missions of Neuroscience Ai\nand mental health uh generally there's a\nbrilliant young researcher up at the\nUniversity of Washington named Sam\ngolden he's um spent a lot of his career\nstudying animal models of um aggression\num and rage um and of course some forms\nof suicide are thought to be forms of\nself-directed aggression and rage it\nmakes sense um some forms of suicide\nperhaps are different I don't think we\nquite understand what suicide represents\nin the brain just yet and I think\nthey're having spoken to Paul kti and\nand others about suicide um it's clear\nthat there are unfortunately many paths\nto Suicide there's in one brain State\nnonetheless um Sam's laboratory has been\ndeveloping tools that help people with\nSuicidal Tendencies or people who have\nhad suicidal ideation or plans in the\npast um with these AI based tools where\nit detects changes in their\nvoice in their sleep patterns and in a\nfew other metrics that I don't recall\nthat together become very good\npredictors of um later suicidal ideation\nso the idea here is that um people who\nare prone to Suicide um often don't\nrealize that they're drifting that way\nuntil it can sadly be too late so um\nthe point here is uh a biomarkers are\nkey B these biomarkers are being\ndeveloped uh C AI is critical but that\naccording to Sam um changes in sleep\npatterns is absolutely Central to these\nalgorithms for allowing people to detect\ntheir own um potential for suicide I\nthink it's it's critical and we've\nthought about this when we started to\nsee these sleep signals that were\npreemptive that were almost precognitive\nin the sense of of prediction\noccurred to me that we're at the stage\nof\ntechnological\nEvolution that if we get consent to many\nindividuals who become\nsuicidal are they are interested in some\ndegree of\nsupport and we often but of course some\npeople will just recoil and go into\nthemselves and that's that's when things\ncan get very problematic as well but it\nwould require some degree of consenting\nthat if you have a history of suicide\nadiation in the past what if you were to\nbe able to consent and say I would like\nto risk mitigate and you have a wearable\nlike a watch and that watch is connected\nto your phone and there is a signal that\ncan come from your watch that dials a\nseries of phone numbers in order of\npreference and when your watch starts to\ndetect that your sleep has this one the\nthings we really want to understand is\nwhat is the specific signature of sleep\nabnormalities it's not just that your\nsleep gets short but is it that your\nsleep gets long and then short and then\nlong and then short but it constantly\nhas poor quality of sleep and the\nregularity is all over the place but the\nchronotype timing is still in place what\nsort of specific pattern of those things\nis the Hallmark that is most predictive\nof suicide let's say that I can come up\nwith that algorithm finally and then we\ncan implement it into a watch or a\ntracking device of some sort and when it\nstarts to see that pattern it's\nconstantly pattern matching and it\nstarts to see that across whatever\nnumber of days we say if you see this\nacross six nights or across 13 nights\nthis is serious it then triggers that\nphone to send a message to those\nindividuals who the designated support\ncarers and those people then reach out\nand start to say how are you doing would\nyou like to have a phone call can I come\nover can I make you some food and I'd\nlove to have a chat with you can you\nfind a way to bootstrap a condition\nwhere you constantly then otherwise\nbecome asocial or antisocial and lose\nall support network so that would be the\nthe sort of the grandiose idea the other\nthing that's very interesting is that we\ncould measure their activity and their\nwakefulness at night and the reason I\nbring this up is some great work by\nMichael peus and U Michael grandner\nwho've looked at\nsuicide um both attempts and suicide\ncompletion across the 24-hour period\nit's not constant it's not that you see\nsuicide ideation and suicide attempts\nand completion in a distributed manner\nequally across the 24-hour period when\ndo they principally occur they occur in\nthe late middle of the night and there's\nthis almost a four to five hour period\nyou know somewhere on average and again\nit's just an average somewhere between\nlet's say 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. which it\nturns out to be right at the lowest dip\nof your Cadian Rhythm and it could be\nCadian Rhythm but I also think that\nthere's something about of course the\nnight ESS when no one else is around\naround and it is just you bad point\nnumber one second as we've spoken about\nbefore on this episode negative thoughts\nare 10 times worse in the darkness of\nnight than they are in the light of\nday and third at that point if you're\nawake you're not asleep and we know\nsleep is providing this balast to your\nmental health so on all three of those\ncounts you see this very strong spike in\nsuicide ideation suicide attempt and\nalso suicide completion in this\nbewitching hour in the middle of the\nnight there's a final piece in the\nsuicide story though that is only just\nemerging if you are not getting\nsufficient sleep you are somewhere\nbetween two to three times more likely\nto go into that suicidal state which is\na very significant number however when\npeople started to measure another factor\nof sleep and particularly dream sleep\nwhich was the dream content itself it\nbecame even more predictive and we've\nnot really seen this very much in\npsychiatric conditions but what they\nfound was that instead of using your\nsleep disruption or your lack of sleep\nas a predictor of your suicide risk we\nuse nightmares as a predictor of your\nsuicide risk that predictive value that\nrisk went from about two to three times\nmore likely to somewhere between 5 to8\ntimes more likely there is something\nspecial going on with bad dreams and\nspecifically nightmares that is even\nmore predictive than this physiological\nthing that we call Sleep itself and\nwe'll probably come on to maybe some of\nthe reasons why dreaming and\nparticularly nightmares in the next\nepisode on dreaming could explain\nexactly why that is but it's a new\nfinding I don't think we can say much\nmore about it now but it is one of the\nmost I think novel findings in the\npsychiatric sleep story that now dreams\nhave come above and beyond simply sleep\nitself as a predictor of mental illness\nand specifically a form that will take\nyour life tragically very\nquickly when I think about depression\nI immediately associate that with\nexcessive amounts of\nsleep after all it's called depression\nbut what is the real link between major\ndepression which is you know the\nclassical um you know signs of you know\nmala's um one of the Hallmark features\nalso being a uh a lack of optimism about\nthe future or Andor ability to sense\ninto the future that's what it's not the\nonly criteria um when Dr Carl daero the\ngreat neuroscientist that he is was on\nthis podcast and of course he's also a\npracticing clinical psychiatrist I when\nwe were talking about depression he\nmentioned that another Hallmark of major\ndepression is people waking up at 2: or\n3:00 a.m. and not being able to fall\nback asleep um this just seems like a\nrecipe for disaster all around um that\nthe very condition that you're trying to\nperhaps amarate with additional sleep is\npreventing you from sleeping it's like I\ncouldn't imagine very cruel is a whole a\nwhole lot of things more diabolical um\nin terms of the sleep sleep science so\nwhat's the relationship between sleep\nand depression and how how should one um\nuntangle that like seemingly gordi and\nnot it\nis like the other conditions\nbidirectional that depression can\ndisrupt sleep very much and disrupted\nsleep can trigger depression depression\nis interesting by the way some people\nhave conceptualized it as being\ndifferent to anxiety based in some ways\non memory which is that when you think\nabout anxiety people consider anxiety a\ndisorder of the future that you are\nconstantly worried about what's coming\nup in the future I I didn't do this\ntoday so I need to do that tomorrow and\nthen I've got that other thing next week\nor I'm fearful of going out to see them\ntomorrow I just I'm fearful of taking\nthat flight tomorrow it seems to be so\nmuch about prospective future whereas\nother people have suggested depression\nis the opposite it's about rumination of\nthe past I went through this event I had\nthis bereavement I had this painful\ndivorce I just can't get over my past\nnow I don't necessarily know if that's\nentirely true but it it is interesting\nin the sense that both of those abnormal\nprospection worry of the future and\nabnormal\nretrospection sort of ruminating on the\npast seem to disrupt sleep before um you\ncontinue I just wanted to drill into\nthat that idea just a little bit because\nI think it's a really interesting one\nworth exploring again I'm no\npsychiatrist but I have heard and I've\nexperienced the I've had a depression I\nthink it's my understanding is it's\nnormal for um people to experience a\nmajor depressive episode at some point\nin their lives could be situationally\ntriggered or not but that um for others\nUnfortunately they have repeating major\ndepressive episodes and hopefully some\npeople go through life never having had\na depressive episode but as I recall\nthat one of the more Salient um thought\npatterns was that I used to have\nsomething that somehow was lost and I\ncouldn't quite figure out what it was it\nwas this curring feeling of right like\nthings were on track and then they got\noff track but not being able to to tack\nthe uh progression from on track to off\ntrack to one particular event it was\nthis sort of sense that like I had\nsomething that them was lost now\nfortunately for me it eventually lifted\nuh and you know it didn't get um\ndangerously bad um but I I've had some\nclose friends who've gone through\nindividual or several major depressions\nand I I hear this like this idea that\nthey had they had it or they think\nsomething was there that then they lost\nso I think I I agree with well if you\nthink about the word that you just used\nhad is about right it's it's about it's\nthe past right right it's past tense\nright and then if if we apply the\ncriteria that is is indeed part of the\ncriteria for determining if somebody has\nmajor depression which is a lack of\noptimistic outlook on the future one can\nsee how one could be very much stuck in\nthe present and focused on the past and\nyou know just stuck in that spin cycle\num anyway we're not here to um to uh\ndecide what depression is or isn't in\nevery case but I I'm I'm not a\npsychiatrist either right but but I\nthink this distinction between anxiety\nbeing about the future in a way that\ndisrupts one's present and depression\nbeing about often the past in a way that\ndisrupts one's sense of the present and\nthe future um makes a lot of sense it's\njust a a nice um not nice it's\nunfortunate but it's a um it could be a\nuseful a useful contextualization yeah\nthank you and I to your question though\nabout sleep it's it's been a little bit\ninteresting with depression firstly what\nwe know is that depression will disrupt\nyour sleep and make your sleep shorter\nand it comes back to um your comment\nfrom uh from Carl from Carl di we often\nsee that patients will have problems\nstaying asleep they wake up in the\nmiddle of the night they can't get back\nto sleep it's\nproblematic and therefore their sleep\nduration and their Sleep Quality\ndecrease however on the other hand there\nis an interesting question by the way of\ncan you get too much sleep which I\nshould probably come back as there's a\nwhole episode to do on that probably but\none of the places where we see quote\nunquote too much sleep is in the\ndepression literature and it's a\ncondition that we call hypersomnia in\nother words increased or excessive\ndegrees of sleep hypersomnia here but a\na great PhD student at Berkeley looked\nat the data um Kate Kaplan who's a\nfantastic um cognitive behavioral\ntherapist now and a clinical\npsychologist looked a little bit at the\ndata and others have looked at this\ntoo when you examine what people were\nasking those patients where there is\nthis conclusion that patients with\ndepression can sleep too long really\nwhat they were asking in those studies\nwas what time you go to bed and what\ntime do you wake up and there what you\nclearly find is that people with\ndepression will be in bed for\nsignificantly longer periods of time and\nthe inference there and you could argue\nalmost the conflation is that if you're\nin bed for longer then you're sleeping\nfor longer and therefore depression is a\ncondition of\nhypersomnia but when people looked at\nthis a little bit more in a nuanced way\nand asked a different question what time\ndid you go to sleep and what time did\nyou wake up that hypersomnia phenomenon\nis nowhere near as strong as you would\nhave been led to believe otherwise from\nthe what time did you go to bed and what\ntime did you wake up and I think part of\nthe reason comes back to depression as a\ncondition when you think about\ndepression one of the aspects one of the\nfeatures is that you're depressed to the\npoint where you just don't want to\ninteract with the world and what better\nplace to spend if that's your mentality\nthan this thing called bed I just don't\nwant to get out of bed I'm just going to\nstay here and lie in bed I'm awake I'm\nnot asleep and so we don't quite know\nyet if depression is a condition that is\nassociated with long sleep we certainly\nKnow It's associated with short sleep\nand disrupted sleep or that is\nmasquerading as this thing called\nhypersomnia but when you really look at\nthe data it's not quite so clear\nthat was the first peculiarity in\ndepression that there could be this\nParadox of yes long sleep but also not\nenough sleep too short sleep one of the\nearliest findings in depression and\nsleep and has been quite well replicated\nis a change in REM sleep but now it\nwasn't necessarily that individuals who\nhad depression slept or had excessive\namounts of REM sleep they had a little\nbit more what was interesting is that\nwhen that REM sleep emerged during the\nnight was much earlier and in the first\nepisode I was telling you that when you\nyour head hits the pillow you go down to\nthe light stages of nonr then into the\ndeeper stages and then maybe after about\n50 60 70 80 minutes you'll pop up and\nyou'll have your short REM sleep period\nbut that first REM sleep period in\npeople with depression seem to have been\ncalled up by the brain abnormally or not\nmuch earlier so it's what we call REM\nsleep latency from the moment that you\nfell asleep what is the time what is the\nlatency of the first arrival of REM\nsleep and that REM sleep latency was\nsignificantly shorter in those people\nwith depression Ram sleep was arriving\nearlier now it's hard because you can\nargue and this is these are the most\ndangerous hypotheses you can argue both\nsides of it you can say well perhaps\nthat's because Matt you also spoke to me\nthat REM sleep may be important for some\naspects of the emotional brain and when\nyou are depressed the brain knows that\nREM sleep is required and it calls it up\non the menu of the series of dishes that\nyou're going to be served earlier on in\nthe night because it's needed more\nsignificantly the other and that's the\nadaptive theory the other is the\nmaladaptive Theory which is that\narriving with your REM sleep too early\ndoes not do your brain good things and\ntherefore it's some abnormality of\nemotional\nprocessing the data that's interesting\nthere is that if you look at some\nanti-depressants many of them will\neither delay the onset of REM sleep or\nthey will reduce it significantly now\nthere's a huge debate about the efficacy\nand the utility of anti-depressants and\nI I don't have a horse in that race and\nI don't know know enough about that\nliterature to comment I would simply say\nthough that it's at least intriguing to\nme that some\nmedications that are commonly prescribed\nas anti-depressants will alter\nspecifically rem's sleep and push it\nlater or try to reduce it down and that\nwould fit with the maladaptive\nhypothesis that this arrival of REM\nsleep so early in depression and perhaps\nhaving a little too much REM sleep isn't\noptimal and when you push back against\nthat with pharmacology I.E\nanti-depressants you seem to get some\ndegree of resolution or reduction in the\ndepression\nsymptomatology again I don't think we've\nwe clearly understand\nthat the another strange thing that is\nhas been often cited to me many times\nabout sleep and depression is a\nliterature that suggests that if you\ndeprive people of sleep which time and\nagain in this episode we've said leads\nto bad outcomes for mental health it\ndoes exactly the opposite in depression\nthat if you sleep deprive a depressed\npatient you get a resolution of the\ndepression and that is the claim that's\noften made to me now it is a very clear\nset of data in the literature but there\nare two potential concerns with it the\nfirst concern is that not all patients\nrespond to sleep deprivation in fact if\nyou look at the data it's somewhere\nbetween 30 to 55% of patients will be\nresponders to sleep depravation the\nother proportion of those patients don't\nrespond or if anything get worse when\nyou sleep deprive them and then the\nquestion is well how would you know and\nright now and there have been some brain\nImaging studies some pet studies done\nway back at UC irine U and other\nlocations where they were trying to say\nis there something about the metabolic\nactivity of your brain that can predict\nif you're a responder or not sleep\ndeprivation because at least then we\nwould know who should we push through\nthis quote unquote treatment and who\nshould we not because it's going to be\nbad for them that's the first issue and\nwe don't have a clear understanding the\nsecond issue is that as soon as those\npatients with depression sleep after the\ndeprivation the anti-depressant benefit\ngoes away and they go right back to\nbeing depressed again so yes it's a\nmechanistic interesting process what is\nit about sleep deprivation that could\nalleviate depression and I'll explain\nwhy I think it\ncan but it's not a sustainable one it's\nnot a clinically viable\none why would it have that effect if it\ndoes well you and I discussed earlier in\nthis episode that when you are sleep\ndeprived not only does your emotional\nbrain become much more responsive to\nnegative things also becomes much more\nresponsive to rewarding\npositive things and one of the\ninteresting things that I think people\nmistake about depression they just think\nthat when I'm depressed I have sad mood\nI have negative mood that's not entirely\ntrue one of the principal features of\ndepression is something that we call\nanhedonia which is an absence of having\nthe ability to have honic responses in\nother words you can't get pleasure from\nnormally pleasurable things it's not an\nissue about sliding down to the negative\nit's the absence of being able to\nexperience the positive that puts you on\na track towards depression and what you\nand I discussed earlier in this episode\nis some of the work that we've been\ndoing where when you sleep deprive\nindividuals but you show them very\nrewarding based stimuli they become much\nmore reward sensitive and perhaps this\nis why patients will respond to sleep\ndeprivation with depression because\nthey're too far away from that positive\nend of the spectrum they're not reward\nsensitive enough they don't get a\npositive good feeling now if you're\nsomeone who is healthy and you're sleep\ndeprived you go too far in the reward\ndirection and you become vulnerable to\nreward and sensation seeking but if\nyou're depressed and you're shifted to\nsort of away from that and sleep\ndeprivation brings you back closer to a\nnormative reward-based\nreactivity maybe that's the reason why\nyou get this anti-press present benefit\nand why when you start sleeping again\nyou take away that enhanced reward\nsensitivity and you lose the\nanti-depressant benefit so I think we\nstill don't know enough\nabout depression and sleep yet if you\nwere to ask me of the four quantity\nquality regularity and timing which\nwould be\nideal I would say all four are\ndefinitely players but timing may have\nsome of the best evidence because it's\nnot just about sleep when it comes to\ndepression it's also about your\ncircadian rhythm that if you are not\naligned with your natural chronotype\nyour natural 24-hour Rhythm Cadian\nmisalignment when you fall out of\nsynchrony with your natural chronotype\nis a strong predictor of depression so\nif there is an actionable item first it\nwould be to say from a big picture\nperspective understand that sleep is one\nof\nthe least\npainful available options for you as a\nno cost to try to stabilize your mental\nhealth now I'm not suggesting that all\npsychiatric conditions are Sleep\nDisorders that's not true and I'm not\nsuggesting that you should stop simply\nat the place of getting your sleep\nstraight to help with your mental\nconditions not at all I am saying\nhowever that if you do get your sleep\nstraight it's only going to help and may\nhelp quite a significant amount based on\nthe data but when it comes to depression\nI would say of those four qqr T there's\nvery strong emerging data that Cadian\nmisalignment not matching your\nchronotype to the time when you are\nsleeping and the time you are awake is\none of the strongest factors so if you\nwant to say I can't do all of them Matt\nI can't do all of this Q qrt nonsense\njust tell me one of them to start with I\nwould say don't worry we'll get to the\nthree others let's just start with\ngetting your timing right let's\nunderstand what type you are take the um\ngo online you can take one of these\ntests the um meq the morningness\neveningness questionnaire you can just\nGoogle it it's free you can we'll\nprovide a link to it in the show note\ncaption that's great um understand what\ntype you are and then try to understand\nbased on what time I'm currently\nAwakening sleep is it matched is it\nmismatched and if it's mismatched try to\nsee what you can do with your lifestyle\naccommodating of course to match that\nthings will more than likely start there\ngetting\nbetter along those lines um and if I may\nuh I'd like to just mention a recent\nstudy that I think dovetails with what\nyou just said beautifully and seems\nhighly actionable to me this was a study\npublished in um nature mental health\nwhich is a relatively new Journal um but\nit involved exploring the light exposure\nand dark exposure patterns of I believe\nit was more than 80,000 individuals I'll\nhave to go back and check that but what\nwas interesting is that um when they\nlooked at light exposure in particular\nsunlight exposure and they looked at\nDarkness exposure across the 24-hour\nschedule what they concluded was that\nthere was a near linear relationship\nbetween the amount of light that one\ngets in the morning and throughout the\nday and reduction in mental\nhealth challenges at the in terms of\ndepression PTSD there were a few others\nsome of the effects were less robust for\ncertain psychiatric conditions than they\nwere for say depression what was equally\ninteresting is that Darkness the absence\nof light turned out to be as important a\nvariable as light during the day Made\nSimple\nif people tended to be in dim or dark\nlight at night they experien reductions\nin their suicidal depressive anxiety and\nPTSD symptoms independent of how much\nlight they were getting during the day\nso what this says is get as much light\nas one can possibly and safely get in\ntheir eyes by the way in the morning and\nthroughout the day and then do one's\nvery best to be in very dim or dark\nenvironments at night yeah and even goes\nso far as to say that if you didn't get\nsunlight during the day then you would\nbe especially well off being in a very\ndark environment at night and it's\nindependent so don't worry yes it's\nalways good to get that daylight but\nwhat that paper also teaches us is that\nbecause those things can be independent\nyou can still get some benefit even if\nthough you've not made it good on your\ndaylight during the day getting that\nDarkness at night is still going to be\nbeneficial and I should probably resolve\nwhat some people may think of as\nconfusing we spoke about for example\nsuicide risk and it being highest in\nthat in the the depths of the Darkness\nat night I think what's clear from that\npaper comes on to one of the fundamental\nconventional tips that we spoke about in\nhow to optimize your sleep not just an\nunconventional but the conventional\nwhich was I told you we are a dark\ndeprived society and we need Darkness at\nnight to help keep our sleep regular so\nthe sort of the the r in the Q\nqrt and I think there in that paper the\ninference of course is that if you're\ngetting dark at night it's going to give\nyou a nice sleep onset signal so that\nyou are asleep at night in the darkness\nand that sleep at night in the darkness\nprovides this beneficial you know sort\nof not immunization but at least\npallative help to certain psychiatric\nconditions we're not suggesting that\nDarkness at night if you're awake at\nnight however is beneficial that seems\nto be not beneficial um but it was such\na a great paper and very elegant in how\nit dissected the independent nature of\nthese things which fits very well with I\nthink your mission in part in life both\nas a scientist and as an educator which\nis how can I curate information gather\nit together and give you some type of\nactionable boots on the ground feet in\nthe trenches advice as to what to do it\nwas a great paper um so thank you for\nbringing it up yeah I only wish I had\ndone that study but I'm so glad that\nothers did one thing that's been helpful\nto me to um encourage uh more darkness\nand dim light at night uh for myself in\nmy home environment is to think about uh\nartificial photons coming from\nartificial sources as sort of um empty\ncalories\nand how sunlight provided one isn't\ngetting a burn and you know people\ndebate uh you know how best to do that\nphysical barrier everyone agrees on\ncertain sunscreens are are safer than\nothers some are very safe some are\nperhaps less safe in any event the point\nis\nthat trying to make one's home\nenvironment dark at night is in my mind\nnow uh akin to trying to avoid eating\nsugary uh you know non-nutritious\ncalories at night as well it just lends\nitself to a a um just overall feelings\nof well-being improved sleep and of\ncourse improved daytime wakefulness and\nthen getting sunlight even on uh through\ncloud cover in one's eyes early in the\nday and as much as as safely possible\nthroughout the day and if one can't get\nsunlight getting light from Bright\nartificial sources um seems to be the\nbest alternative um but I think there's\nthis asymmetry of Light Dark requirement\nin the same way that I think most\neveryone agrees that eating during one's\nactive hours of the day is going to be\nthe best way to go as opposed to eating\nduring the Ina less active hours of of\nthe late night and um and certainly\nprior to sleep such a good point and\nsince it's only you and I here and no\none else watching and witnessing this I\nam thoroughly going to steal that phrase\nof junk light and help educate people\nbecause that's a perfect description\nit's like empty photons yeah you've all\nheard of junk food well there's\nsomething called Junk light and if you\nget you know your whole foods during the\nday just like you get your whole kind of\nencompassed light during the day that's\ngreat but then if you start binging on\njunk light at night it's profoundly\ndeleterious to your sleep and everything\nthat sleep depends on it's lovely so\nwhen people hear me in future um public\nspheres talking about junk light you\nknow where it came from I will give you\nfull credit it's a delightful statement\nbecause I I may have I may have lifted\nfrom somebody else inadvertently um we\nall stand on the shoulders of other\nGiants that's right or other Twitter\naccounts or something like that well I\nplace myself firly uh underneath a\npedestal but yes we all try to stand on\nthose shoulders of giants well wherever\nyou place yourself the the information\nthat that uh emerges from you and that\nemerged today is absolutely spectacular\nuh you know I can't think of topics U\nmore interesting and important then\nemotion regulation anxiety PTSD suicide\nsadly depress all all these things are\nare tragic challenges that but they are\na real part of of Life some argue even\nmore so nowadays perhaps even because of\num the Advent of so much artificial\nlight and smartphone use in the middle\nof the night who knows it's um I think\nit's reasonable to assume it's at least\none variable today you've provided a ton\nof depth of understanding about why\nsleep and these mental health and\nemotional states are linked just a\nreally clear logical framework for both\nthe non-rem sleep and and REM sleep and\nhow it impacts mood and and reactivity\nduring the daytime and also some really\nactionable tools um to improve one's\nmental health and emotion emotionality\nexcuse me um and in addition to that\nwe'll refer people back to episodes 1\ntwo 3 and four all of which include\ntools to improve every aspect of sleep\nand to really really nail down the QQ\nart T that quality do you put quality\nfirst or quantity quantity quantity I'm\njust making sure that qqr t to really\nnail down the quantity quality\nregularity and timing of sleep um we can\nno longer consider sleep just uh 6 to\neight hours or get your nine hours or\nget your um get your seven hours clearly\nthere are other variables involved and\nyou've made those variables very clear\nto us and you've given us the road map\nto plug in the best variables for\nourselves so thank you Matt ever so much\nthank you for allowing me to both um\nvoice and narrate the important story of\nsleep in mental health it's something\nI'm immensely passionate about both from\na personal perspective but also
