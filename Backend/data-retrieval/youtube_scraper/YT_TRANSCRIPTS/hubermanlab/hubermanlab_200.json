    "video_title": "Dr. Duncan French: How to Exercise for Strength Gains & Hormone Optimization",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, I have the pleasure of\nintroducing Dr. Duncan French\nas my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nDr. French is the Vice\nPresident of Performance\nat the UFC Performance Institute,\nand he has over 20 years of experience\nworking with elite, professional,\nand Olympic athletes.\nPrior to joining the UFC,\nFrench was the Director\nof Performance Science\nat the University of Notre Dame,\nand he has many, many\nquality peer-reviewed studies\nto his name, exploring, for instance,\nhow the particular order of exercise,\nwhether or not one\nperforms endurance exercise\nprior to resistance\ntraining or vice versa,\nhow that impacts performance\nof various movements\nand endurance training protocols,\nas well as the impact on hormones,\nsuch as testosterone, estrogen,\nand some of the stress\nhormones such as cortisol.\nHe's also done fascinating work\nexploring how neurotransmitters,\nthings like dopamine and epinephrin,\nalso called adrenaline,\ncan impact hormones,\nand how hormones can impact\nneurotransmitter release.\nWhat's particularly unique\nabout Dr. French's work\nis that he's figured out\nspecific training protocols\nthat can maximize, for\ninstance, testosterone output\nor reduce stress hormone output\nin order to maximize\nthe effects of training\nin the short-term and in the longterm.\nSo, today, you're going to\nlearn a lot of protocols.\nWhether or not you're\ninto resistance training\nor endurance training, you\nwill learn, for instance,\nhow to regulate the\nduration of your training\nand the type of training that you do\nin order to get the maximum benefit\nfrom that training over time.\nSo whether or not you are somebody\nwho just exercises\nrecreationally for your health,\nwhether or not you're an\namateur or professional athlete,\nor whether or not you're just\ntrying to maximize your health\nthrough the use of endurance\nand/or resistance training,\ntoday's discussion will have\na wealth of takeaways for you.\nThere are only a handful of people\nworking at the intersection\nof elite performance,\nmechanistic science, and\nthat can do so in a way\nthat leads to direct,\nimmediately applicable protocols\nthat anybody can benefit from.\nDr. French also provides some\nincredibly important insights\nabout the direction\nthat sport and exercise\nare taking in the world today,\nand their applications towards\nperformance and health.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI have spent my career\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that everything\nabout the way that ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwas with performance in mind.\nFirst of all, they're\nextremely lightweight\nso you actually forget\nthat you're wearing them\nmost of the time.\nSecond of all, even if you get sweaty,\nif you're running or\nbiking or it's a hot day\nor you're running around and just happen\nto be perspiring quite a lot,\nthey don't slip off your\nface, which is terrific.\nThey also have a great aesthetic\nand they have a lot of\ndifferent styles to choose from.\nThe clarity of the lenses is superb.\nI don't think there's\na match for the clarity\nof ROKA glasses out there.\nAnd if there is, I'm not aware of it.\nThey are absolutely crystal clear.\nAnd that's true in any environment,\nwhether or not you're\nworking in a dim environment\nor a bright environment,\nthe clarity is unmatched.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\nyou can go to roka.com.\nThat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code \"Huberman\"\nto save 20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are uniquely tailored\nto your sleep needs.\nAll of us have unique sleep needs,\nand we should be sleeping on a\nmattress that's ideal for us.\nIf you go to the Helix site,\nthey have a quick two minute quiz,\nask you a number of questions\nabout whether or not\nyou sleep on your side,\nyour back, your stomach.\nDo you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera?\nMaybe you don't have the\nanswers to those questions,\nwhich is fine.\nThey'll match you to the mattress\nthat's ideal for your sleep needs.\nI took that quiz and about 10 months ago\nI started sleeping on\nthe Dusk Helix mattress.\nThat's D-U-S-K.\nThat's the mattress that's ideal for me,\nand I'm sleeping better\nthan I ever have before.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/Huberman,\ntake their two minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you\nto a customized mattress\nand you'll get up to $200\noff all mattress orders\nand two free pillows.\nThat's helixsleep.com/Huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app\nthat's backed by 25 published studies.\nBy now I think most\npeople have heard about\nor experienced the benefits of meditation;\nimproved focus, better\nsleep, reduced stress,\nmore creativity and insight.\nThere are just so many studies out there\nthat support those claims.\nThe challenge, however,\nis sticking to a meditation practice.\nAnd over the years, I\nconfess there have been times\nwhen I've meditated regularly\nand then I stopped meditating,\neven though it always\nprovides benefits for me\nthe first time I do it\nand every time I do it.\nWith the Headspace app,\nit makes it very easy\nto meditate consistently\nbecause they have different\ntypes of meditations\nto select from, and they\ncome in different durations.\nSo sometimes I only have three\nor four minutes to meditate.\nThey have those sorts of meditations.\nThey also have longer meditations\nof 20 minutes or more.\nIf you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nget a free one month trial\nwith Headspace's full\nlibrary of meditations\nthat you can use in any situation.\nThis is the best deal offered\nby Headspace right now.\nSo, again, if you're interested,\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd now, my conversation\nwith Dr. Duncan French.\nDuncan French, great to see you again.\n- Likewise, likewise, thank you.\nI don't often have many\nStanford professors\nin the Performance Institute,\nso I'm really excited.\n- Oh, well, this place is amazing,\nand you have a huge role\nin making it what it is.\nThe reason I'm so excited\nto talk with you is that\nyou're one of these rare beasts\nthat you have been involved\nin human performance\nand athletic performance\nat the collegiate level.\nYou are obviously very\ninvolved in MMA now,\nin the UFC Performance Institute.\nAnd you also had the fortunate experience,\nI like to think, of doing a PhD in...\nWhat exactly was the PhD in?\n- It was exercise physiology.\n- Exercise physiology.\nSo, you're familiar also\nwith designing studies,\ncontrol groups, all the sorts\nof things that in my opinion,\nanyway, are kind of lacking\nfrom the internet social media\nversion of exercise science,\nwhich is that people throw\nout all sorts of ideas\nabout how people should be training,\nwhat they should be doing and eating\nand not eating and doing.\nAnd certainly, science\ndoesn't have all the answers,\nbut I just think it's\nso rare to find somebody\nthat's at the convergence of\nall those different fields.\nAnd so, I have a lot of\nquestions for you today\nthat I'm sure the audience are going to be\nreally interested in.\n- Well, listen,\nI mean, I appreciate that.\nIt's very humbling, and yeah,\nI've worked hard to get to where I am,\nbut I've always tried to be authentic.\nAnd I think authenticity comes\nalongside academic rigor,\nand objectivity, and insight\nand knowledge base, right?\nAt the end of the day, it's\nabout having confidence,\nhaving expertise and being\nable to deliver that expertise\nto, in my world, to athletes.\nAnd I think, and that's what\nI've always tried to do.\nI've tried to have many strings to my bow\nso that I can talk with\nmany different hats on.\nYou know, one day I'm talking to a coach,\nthe next day I'm talking to an athlete,\nthe next day I'm talking to a CEO,\nthe next day I'm talking\nto an academic professor.\nAnd so, I think being able\nto wear those different hats\nis certainly a skillset\nthat I've tried to build\nthroughout my career.\nAnd like you said, I've\nbeen blessed to work with,\nI think it was 36 different\nprofessional or Olympic sports\nlast time I counted.\n- Amazing.\n- So, yeah, it's been a wild ride.\nIt's been great.\n- Which of those sports\nwas the most unusual?\n- I've worked with crown green bowling.\n- Wait, what?\n- Which I don't know,\nas an American guy, I don't know-\n- I've never heard of it.\n- How well you'd know that,\nbut basically imagine a 20\nfoot by 20 foot square of turf\nwith a small raise in the\nmiddle, i.e. the crown.\nSo, it slopes to the edges.\n- Okay.\n- And then, you throw out a\nwhite jack, a smaller ball,\nand then you roll out larger balls\nto try and get closest to the jack.\nIt's a very European thing, let's say.\n- Interesting.\n- But yeah, sports performance\nin crown green bowling, and there you go.\n- All right.\n[Duncan laughing]\nWow, and then to mixed\nmartial arts, fighters-\n- Absolutely, there you go.\n- And everything in between.\nSo, along those lines,\ncan you give us a little\nbit about your background?\nWhere'd you start out?\nWhere are you from originally?\n- Yeah, I'm from the northeast of England.\nSo I'm from a town called\nHarrogate, which is in Yorkshire,\nwhich is a northern kind of area\nof the UK-\n- Nice sunny weather\nall year long?\n- Yeah, you can imagine.\nYeah, with the two weeks of\nsummer that we get, you know?\n[Duncan laughs]\nBut yeah, I mean, I did\nmy undergraduate studies\nthere in sports science.\nI did teacher training to be\na physical education teacher after that.\nLike most people I then\nworked as a high school\nphysical education teacher.\nYou know, great experience\nworking with kids,\ndeveloping athletic qualities.\nBut something in the\nback of my mind always,\nI wanted more, I wanted\nto be at the higher end\nof elite sport.\nI was a failed athlete like many people.\nI represented my country in\ndifferent sports and things,\nbut I never made it professionally.\nSo, that little seed was sown\nand as much as I then started\nto reach out to different\nareas to do a PhD,\nwhether it was in the UK or also,\nchance my arm, took a punt,\nsee if I could get over to the states.\nI mean, all my buddies\nwere going on gap years\nafter they finish university or whatever,\nand going to Bali and\nhanging out or whatever,\ntraveling through Thailand.\nAnd I figured, well, I've\nalways loved the states\nand can I go and kill\ntwo birds with one stone\nand do something academic,\ncontinue my studies,\nbut also do it in a different environment\nand get some life experience.\nAnd many, many rejections,\nas I'm sure you kind of aware\nfrom different professors,\nwhether it was Roger\nNoecker or William Kramer-\n- So you wrote to these folks?\n- I just cold called and send\nout information and saying,\n\"Yeah, so have you got any opportunities?\"\nPushed back from them all,\nbut dogged and kept asking,\nand yeah, Dr. William Kramer,\nwho was at Ball State University\nin Indiana at the time,\na muscle neuroendocrinologist\nand researcher\nin muscle physiology\nusing resistance training,\nhe basically said, listen,\nI can guarantee your funding\nfor the first year of your\nstudies, but not the next three.\n- Sounds like a typical academic response.\n- Yeah.\n- I can take care of you,\nbut not that well necessarily.\n- Right.\n- Right, yeah.\n- Yeah, so, I spoke\nto my parents and said,\n\"Hey, can we take a punt?\"\nAnd they were great in supporting me.\nAnd yeah, long story short,\ncame out to begin my PhD at Ball State.\nAfter a year, Dr. Kramer\ntransferred to UConn,\nConnecticut, in Storrs,\nin the Northeast there.\nAnd I transferred with him and yeah,\nfour great years with my\nPhD and getting my PhD\nwith a really prolific\nresearch group that looked at\nneuroendocrinology, hormonal work,\nbut using a resistance training\nprimarily as an exercise\nstressor as a major mechanism,\nand then looking at all\nthe different physiologies\noff the back of resistance training.\n- Yeah, you guys were\nenormously productive.\nI found dozens of papers\non how weight training\nimpacts hormones and your\nname is on all of 'em.\nAnd it's remarkable.\nI have a question about this.\nI'll just inject a question\nabout weight training and hormones.\nYou hear this all the\ntime that doing these big,\nheavy compound movements\nor resistance training\nincreases androgens, things\nlike testosterone, DHT,\nDHEA, and so forth.\nDoes anyone know how\nthat actually happens?\nLike what is it about\nengaging motor neurons\nunder heavy loads sends a\nsignal to the endocrine system,\n\"Hey, release testosterone.\"\nI've never actually been able\nto find that in a textbook.\n- [Duncan] Yeah, well, I mean-\n- And how can I do more of that?\n[both laughing]\n- Yeah, as much as I know, and again,\nI'm digging out into the\nannals of Duncan French's\nkind of brain now, but yeah.\nI mean, I think it's a\nstress response, right?\nIt's mechanical stress\nand it's metabolic stress.\nAnd these are the downstream\nregulation of testosterone\nrelease at the gonads comes\nfrom many different areas.\nMy work primarily looked at catecholamines\nand sympathetic arousal.\n- So things like epinephrin, adrenaline?\n- Correct, yeah, epinephrin,\nadrenaline, and noradrenaline,\nhow they were signaling;\nthe signaling cascade using the HPA axis,\nreleasing cortisol,\nand then looking at how\nthat also influenced the\nadrenal medulla to release\nandrogens and then signaling\nthat at the gonads.\n- That raises an interesting question.\nSo, in presumably weight\ntraining in women,\npeople who don't have testes\nalso it increases testosterone.\n- Yes, yeah.\n- And is that purely\nthrough the adrenals?\nWhen women lift weights,\ntheir adrenal glands release testosterone?\n- Absolutely.\nI mean, that is the only area\nof testosterone release for females.\nAnd yes, it's the same downstream cascade.\nObviously the extent to which it happens\nis significantly less in females,\nbut there's good data out there that shows\nfemales can increase their\nanabolic environment,\ntheir internal anabolic milieu\nusing resistance training as a stressor.\nAnd then they get the\nconsequent muscle tissue growth,\nwhether it's tendon,\nligament, adaptations,\nthe beneficial consequences\nof resistance training,\nwhich is driven by anabolic stimuli.\n- Yeah, I have two questions about that.\nThe first one is something\nthat you mentioned,\nwhich is that the androgens,\nthe testosterone comes from\nthe adrenals under\nresistance loads in women.\nIs the same true in men?\nI mean, we hear that the\ntestes produce testosterone\nwhen we weight train for\nmen that have testes,\nbut do we know whether\nor not it's the adrenals\nor the testes in men that\nare increasing testosterone\nmore or both-\n- Yeah I think that-\n- A little bit from each?\n- The field is divided presently\nin as much as understanding\nthe acute adrenergic response\nin terms of anabolic response\nto exercise in an acute phase\nand the exposure to a stimulus\nthat is stress driven,\nwhich might be partly\nfrom the adrenal glands,\npartly from the gonads,\nversus a longitudinal exposure\nto anabolic environments,\nwhich is primarily driven\nby obviously the gonads\nand the endocrine\nenvironment from testosterone\nrelease at the gonads.\nSo, the field is split in terms\nof how exercise is promoting\nhypertrophy, muscle tissue growth.\nAnd whether that is very\nmuch an adrenal stimuli,\nor if that's significant\nenough in these acute responses\nversus the longitudinal\nexposure to just elevated\nbasal levels of anabolic\ntestosterone habitual level.\n- So, it sounds like with most\nthings, it's probably both.\nIt's probably the adrenals-\n- Absolutely, yeah.\n- And the gonads.\nAnd then you mentioned that testosterone\ncan have enhancing\neffects or growth effects\non tendon and ligament also.\nYou don't often hear about that.\nPeople always think, testosterone, muscle.\nBut testosterone has a lot\nof effects on other tissues\nthat are important for\nperformance it sounds like?\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah what's the story there?\n- Yeah, absolutely, I think\nthe testosterone hormone is...\nI mean, listen, there's androgen receptors\non neural tissue on neural axons.\n- Pretty much everywhere.\nYeah.\n- Exactly, so,\nthe binding capacity of\ntestosterone and influence\nin different tissues within the body,\nI touched on muscle tissue,\nbut the ligaments, the tendons,\neven bone to some extent,\ntestosterone has potential\nto influence that\nin terms of removing osteopenic\nkind of characteristics, et cetera.\nSo, yeah, it's a magic hormone let's say,\nand with many end impacts\nin terms of adaptation.\n- I definitely want to get\nback to your trajectory,\nbut as long as we're on the\ninteractions between androgens,\ntestosterone and its derivatives\nand different tissues,\nfrom the work that you\ndid as a PhD student\nand throughout your career,\ncould you say that there\nare some general principles\nof training that favor\ntestosterone production,\nin terms of that somebody who's not\nan elite athlete could use?\nSomebody who's already adapted\nto weight training somewhat,\nlike they know the difference between\na dumbbell and a barbell,\nand they know the various movements,\nthey're not going to damage themselves.\nBut once they're doing that, I mean,\nI've heard shorter sessions are better\nthan longer sessions, but\nin rep loads, weight...\nNow, there's a lot of parameter space.\nBut if you were going to throw\nout some of the parameters\nthat you think are most\nimportant to pay attention to\nfor the typical person who's\ntrying to use weight training\nto build or maintain muscle.\n- Yeah.\n- Lose body fat, so body\nrecomposition and/or stay strong\nand healthy for sport of a different kind.\n- Yeah, so the work that we obviously,\nI was exposed to back in my PhD,\nit was a double-edged sword.\nAnd as much as testosterone\nis really stimulated\nby an intensity factor\nand also a volume factor.\nNow, growth hormone is\na little bit different.\nThat's largely driven by\nan intensity factor alone.\n- Oh, really?\n- Correct.\n- I always thought the growth\nhormone was driven my volume,\nwhich just goes to show you.\n- Maybe I've got that wrong.\n- No, no, no, no.\nI think you're probably right\nwhich just goes to show you\nthat most of what's out\nthere on the internet-\n- Right, right.\n- Is completely...\nNot only is it wrong,\nit's usually backwards.\nSo, no trust-\n- I trust my instinct.\n- No, trust your instinct\nbecause I think people\njust make this stuff up.\n- Right.\n- Because it's very hard to measure\ngrowth hormone and testosterone.\nAnd I can't imagine most of\nthe stuff that I see out there\nthey're taking drips and\nmeasuring free versus bound\nand all this kind of stuff,\nbut that's what you do in laboratories.\n- Right, yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- You look at total composition\nand you look at how much\nof that is free circulating-\n- Yeah.\n- In the system, how much is bound,\nand therefore biologically\nactive bound to receptor,\ncreating an adaptation.\n- Right.\n- But yeah, coming back\nto testosterone in terms\nof the training strategies,\nit's largely driven by both an intensity\nand a volume factor.\nSo if you look at many of\nthe exercise interventions\nthat we use to try and investigate\nand interrogate testosterone,\nit was usually a six by 10 protocol.\nSo, you're touching at about-\n- Six by 10 meaning?\n- Yeah, six sets of 10 repetitions,\nwhich is quite a large...\n60 repetitions is quite a large volume\nfor a single exercise.\nAnd that was usually\npitched at about 80% intense\nof one repetition max intensity.\n- Okay, so 80% of the one\nrep max, six sets of 10 reps,\nseparated by rest of like-\n- Two minutes.\n- Two minutes,\nwhich is actually pretty fast.\n- Yeah.\n- At least to me.\nAnytime you see these\ntwo to three minutes,\nwhen you're actually watching the clock,\nthose two minute rest\nperiods go by pretty fast.\n- By the third, fourth set\nyou're dying for more, yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- And I think we formulated\nthat kind of exercise\nprotocol to really target\nthe release of testosterone\nand try and drive up\nthese anabolic environments to study\nthe endocrine consequences.\nBut I think that's the type of protocol\nthat is most advantageous for\ndriving anabolic environment.\n- And that was it for the workout?\nThat was it?\n- Yeah, I mean,\nwe would do that in a back squat.\nSo, a multi-joint, challenging exercise,\nmulti-muscle, multi-joint,\n80% load of your one repetition max.\nAnd then, six by 10.\nWe did play around with your\nclassic German Volume Type,\n10 by 10 kind of protocols,\nbut they were just\nunsustainable at that 80%.\nThe key to what we also did was\nwe always adjusted the loads\nto make sure that it was 10\nrepetitions that were sustained.\nSo if the load was too high\nand an athlete or participant\nhad to drop the weights\non the sixth repetition,\nwe would unload the bar and make sure\nthey completed the 10 repetitions.\n- I see.\n- Bringing me back\nto the point of it's an\nintensity and a volume derivative\nthat is going to be most advantageous\nfor testosterone release.\n- That's really interesting.\nAnd one thing that you mentioned there\nis especially interesting to me,\nwhich is you said when\nyou go from six sets\nof 10 repetitions to 10\nsets of 10 repetitions,\nit's not as beneficial and\nmight even be counterproductive.\nBut to me, the difference\nbetween six and 10 sets\nis only four sets.\nIt doesn't even sound that much.\nSo that sort of hints at the\npossibility that the thresholds\nfor going from a workout\nthat increases testosterone\nto a workout that diminishes testosterone\nis actually a pretty narrow margin.\n- Yeah and I think it comes back\nto that intensity factor then.\nWhat we saw were that 10\nby 10 protocol really sees\npretty significant drop-offs in the load.\nAnd again, we're trying to\nstimulate with intensity,\nwith mechanical strain through intensity,\nas well as metabolic\nstrain through volume.\nAnd I think that's the paradigm\nthat you've got to look at\nis that the mechanical\nload has to come from\nthe actual weight on the bar,\nand the volume is the metabolic stimulus.\nHow much are we driving lactate?\nHow much you were driving glycogenolysis\nin terms of that type of energy system for\nexecuting a 10 by 10 protocol?\nAnd what we often saw was\njust a significant reduction\nin the intensity capabilities\nof an athlete to sustain that.\nSo we shortened the volume to try\nand maintain the intensity.\n- Interesting.\nAnd you could imagine just\ntaking very long rest,\nkeeping the session, being a big,\nlazy bear in training.\n- Right.\n- I sometimes do this.\nI tell myself I'm going\nto work out for 45 minutes\nand then two hours later, I'm done,\nbut not because I was huffing\nand puffing the whole time,\nbut because I was training really slowly.\n- Right.\n- Is there any evidence\nthat training slowly can offset\nsome of the negative effects\nof doing a lot of volume?\n- Well, it's an old adage of...\nTwo responses to your question.\nI mean, the first one, I\nwould say there's a difference\nbetween 10 sets of six and six sets of 10.\nAnd I think that comes back\nto the volume conversation.\nSix sets of 10 is driving\nup metabolic stimulus.\nIf you're doing 10 sets of six,\nyou can probably take it\nto a higher intensity,\nbut you're not going to get\nthe same metabolic load.\nYou're not going to get the same\ninternal metabolic environment\nthat drives the lactate release,\nthat they will then signal\nfurther anabolic testosterone\nrelease because of the\nlactate in your body.\nThat's a key consideration.\nThe rest is often the\nconsideration that's overlooked\nout there in general population,\nand in many sporting environments.\nThat the rest is as important\na program and variable\nas the load and the intensity of the load,\nthe volume, et cetera.\nAnd yes, if you extend the volume,\nif you extend the duration\nof your rest periods,\nwhat you're ultimately\ndoing is influencing\nthat metabolic stimulus again.\nYou're allowing the flushing of the body,\nthe removal of waste products,\nlactate to be removed from the body,\nand then the metabolic\nenvironment is reduced.\n- So, if I understand correctly,\nyou want to create a metabolic stress.\n- Absolutely.\n- So, the way that I've\nbeen training, slow and lazy,\nis not necessarily the best way to go?\nI could, in theory, do a\n45 or 60 minute session\nwhere I pack in more work per unit time.\nI'm not going to be able to\nquote unquote perform as well.\nI won't be able to lift as much.\n- Yep.\n- I might have to unweight\nthe bar between sets or\nmaybe even during sets\nif I have someone who could do that,\nbut it sounds like that's the way to go.\nSo, the old adage of high\nintensity, short duration\nis probably the way to go.\n- Correct.\nAnd in layman's terms,\nif the same objective,\nthe same training goal is\njust muscle tissue growth,\nand we're not talking\nabout maximal strength\nor any of those type of parameters,\nwe're just talking about growing muscle.\nIf there's an athlete A\nand they do six sets of 10\nwith two minutes rest,\nand there's athlete B\nthat does six sets of 10\nwith three minute rest,\nathlete A will likely see\nthe highest muscle gains.\n- Hm.\n- Muscle hypertrophy gains\nbecause of the metabolic\nstimulus that they're driving\nwith the shorter rest periods.\n- Interesting.\nAnd for all the years that I've spent\nexploring exercise\nscience and trying to get\nthis information from the\ninternet and various places\nthat this is the first time it's ever been\ntold to me clearly.\nSo, basically I need to put my ego aside\nand I need to not focus so\nmuch on getting as many reps\nwith a given weight and\nkeep the rest restricted\nto about two minutes.\n- Yeah.\n- Get the work in, and then\nI'll derive the benefits.\n- I mean, you've absolutely\nnailed it to be honest.\nAnd again, if you think about human nature\nand how we approach, we're\ninherently lazy, right?\nAs humans, we want to take that rest.\nWe want to take the time out\nto recover and feel refreshed,\nbut we're trying to create\na training stimulus.\nWe're trying to create\na very specific stimulus\ninternal to the body,\nand that is often driven by\nthe metabolic environment\nat that moment in time.\nNow, if we allow the metabolic\nenvironment to change\nby extending the rest periods,\nwe're not going to see as\nbeneficial gains at the end of it.\n- Very interesting.\n- So, it is very much\na motivational and ego\nthing rather than saying,\n\"Okay, I'm going to push\nmy loads as high as I can,\nand really challenge maximal strength,\ndo fewer repetitions, take\nlonger periods of time.\"\nIt's a completely different\napproach to training.\nIt's a different end goal.\n- Interesting.\nAnd you mentioned lactate,\nso it seems still a bit\ncontroversial as to what\nactually triggers hypertrophy.\nYou hear about lactate buildup or people,\nthe common language is the muscle\ngets torn and then repairs,\nbut I don't know, does\nthe muscle actually tear?\n- I mean microtrauma.\n- Okay, microtrauma.\n- Yeah, disruption within\nthe muscle tissue for sure.\n- Interesting.\nAnd we're talking now about\nnon-drug assisted people-\n- Correct, yeah.\n- Whose, let's just say,\nlet's define our terms here.\nThat whose testosterone\nlevels are within the range\nof somewhere between 300 and\n1,500 or whatever, 1,200,\nbecause it does seem that\nathletes who take high levels\nof exogenous androgens can do more work\nand just get protein synthesis\nfrom just doing work.\n- Yeah.\n- I've seen these guys in the gym, right?\nThe telltale signs are\nnot that hard to spot\nwhere they're just doing a ton of volume,\nnot necessarily moving that much weight,\nthey're just bringing\nblood into the tissue.\nAnd then they're loading up on,\nthey're eating a ton of protein,\npresumably 'cause they're\nbasically in puberty part 15.\n- Right.\n- Right, they're on their\n15th round of puberty\nwhere during puberty,\nyou are a protein synthesis machine.\nI mean, to me, that's\npretty clear about puberty.\nInteresting.\nSo, and then, in terms of,\nbecause I know the audience\nlikes to try protocols,\nso you described a protocol very nicely.\nWhat about day-to-day recovery?\nI mean, the workout that you described\nis intense, but short,\nhow many days a week can\nthe typical person do that\nand sustain progress?\n- Yeah, I mean, I think that\ncomes back to your training age\nand your training history.\nObviously there's a\nresilience and a robustness\nwith an incremental training age.\nSo, that's not a protocol\nthat I would advise\nanyone to go out and start tomorrow.\n- They'll be mopping\nthem off the gym floor.\n- Right, but at the same time,\nit's also relative, right?\nSo 80% of your maximum at a\nyoung training age is still 80%\nversus I've been training\n10 years, it's still 80%.\nBut yes, the mechanical load\nis going to be significant,\nit's just more tonnage, right?\nBut yeah, I think a protocol like that,\nwe would look at two times a week,\nsomething that's pretty intensive\nlike that, because again,\nit comes back to the point you make\nis that you really need to\nbe, for want of a better term,\nsuffering a little bit\nthrough that type of protocol,\nboth in terms of the\nchallenge of the load,\nbut also being able to\ntolerate the metabolic stress\nthat you're exposed to.\nIt's a bit of a sicko feeling\nbecause of the lactate\nthat you're driving up.\nSo, I wouldn't promote an athlete doing\nthat type of modality\nmultiple, multiple times unless\nyou are from the realms of bodybuilding.\nAnd then, you really,\nthat's the sole purpose\nof what you're trying to achieve.\nMost athletes in most sports\nhave diverse requirements\nin terms of outcomes that\nthey're trying to achieve.\nThey're not just targeting muscle growth.\nMuscle growth is a conduit\nto increased strength,\nincreased power, increased\nspeed, obviously.\nSo, yes, trying to get a\nbigger cross-sectional area\nof a muscle means that\nwe can produce more force\ninto the ground or wherever it may be,\nif we're a locomotive athlete.\nBut usually, sports, men and women,\nare not just purely seeking muscle growth.\nThey look for different\nfacets of muscle endurance\nor maximal muscle power, muscle strength.\nSo, then you've got to be very creative\nin how you build the workout.\nIf it's a bodybuilder,\nabsolutely they're chasing\nmuscle growth and they're going to do so\nwith these types of protocols,\nwhich sees high intensities\nand high volumes of workload\non a pretty regular basis.\nIf it's just somebody, a\nweekend warrior that wants\nto keep in shape and\nlook good, I would say,\ntwo times a week for a really\nchallenging workout like that,\nand then flex the other types\nof workouts within the week\nto have more of a volume emphasis,\nwhere you reduce the intensity\nand you might just look\nat larger rep ranges\nfrom 12 to 15 to 20.\nAnother workout where you're\nlooking at reducing the volume,\nbut increasing the intensity\nand really trying to drive\ndifferent stimulus to give you\nmore end points of success.\n- Mm hm, great.\nNo, that's really informative.\nAlong the lines of\nandrogens and intensity.\nWhen I think intensity, I\nthink epinephrin, adrenaline.\nAnd since you have a background\nin catacholamines and testosterone,\nlast time I was here at the\nUFC Performance Institute,\nwe had a brief conversation,\nand I want to make sure\nI got the details right.\nThat in the short term, and a\nbig increase in stress hormone\ncan lead to an increase in testosterone,\nlike a parachute jump.\n- Correct.\n- But so, stress can promote\nthe release of testosterone?\n- Yeah.\n- That was news to me.\n- Right.\n- We always hear about stress\nsuppressing testosterone,\nstress suppressing the immune system,\nall these terrible things.\nBut in the short term,\nyou're saying it can actually\nincrease the release of testosterone.\nSo, I have that right?\n- Correct, yeah, yeah.\n- Okay, and so then\nthe second question is,\ndoes my cognitive\ninterpretation of the stressor\nmake a difference?\nIn other words, if I\nvoluntarily jump out of a plane\nwith a parachute, does it\nhave a different effect\non my testosterone than if\nyou shove me out of the plane\nagainst my will?\nWell, presumably with a parachute too.\n- Right, I mean, so this\nwas what all my PhD work\nwas looking at was the\nexposure to a stressor,\nand the pre-arousal of\nhow your body essentially\nprepares for that stressor,\nand then how it manages it throughout\nthe exposure to the stress.\nAnd it was actually motivated\nfrom parachute jumpers.\nThere was an older study looking\nat parachute jumpers into combat.\nAnd then, they were studying the cortisol,\nthe stress response, and\nthe epinephrin response\nof these parachute jumpers.\nSo, it got us thinking about, hold on,\nthere's certain workouts\nthat you do that are just,\nthey're daunting, you know?\nIt's like, okay, it's squat\nSaturday or whatever it may be.\nOh my gosh, this is going to destroy me.\n- Or I have to talk to this\nperson I don't want to talk to\nor you know, right?\n- Exactly, yeah.\n- I mean, something, or\na PhD dissertation exam-\n- Exactly or speaking-\n- Or something, yeah.\n- Giving public speaking\nor whatever it may be.\nNow, we used an exercise,\nwe used a resistance training\nprotocol that these athletes\nknew was going to be\nvery, very challenging.\nThere's going to have\nsome anxiety to doing it,\nthey knew there were going\nto be some physical distress\nfrom doing it.\nAnd therefore, their mindset\nof how they were going to\napproach that was already set.\nSo what we saw 15 minutes\nprior to the start\nof an exposure to the\nworkout, the epinephrin,\nthe noradrenaline, the\nadrenaline was already starting\nto prepare the body sympathetically\nto go into what it knew\nwas going to be a very,\nvery challenging workout.\nSo, that brings you back\nto exercise preparation,\ncompetition for certain preparation...\nPreparation for certain\ncompetition, excuse me.\nPre-workout routines, the use of music,\nall these different things\nthat we know can now\nanecdotally in the gym we put into place,\nbut the data that I\npresented showed that...\nIt was a first of its kind to\nshow that this link between\nepinephrine and norepinephrine\nrelease and arousal,\nand then consequent performance.\nSo, force output throughout the workout\nwas intimately linked.\n- So, what was the takeaway there?\nIs it beneficial for people\nto get a little stressed\nabout the upcoming impending event?\nWhether or not it's a lift in the gym\nor whether or not it's talking\nto somebody that you might be\nintimidated to talk to, or an exam?\nIs the stress good for\nperformance or is it harmful?\n- Yeah, and I think\nthat's a great question.\nAnd I think I can only\ntalk to physical exertion,\nwhich is what we were exploring.\nAnd I don't want to tread on\nthe toes of the psychologists\nwith flow state and these types\nof things, because clearly-\n- I think you're in the\nposition of scientific strength\non this one.\n- Right.\n- I think you have the leverage.\n- All right.\n- I mean, I have a lot\nof friends in that community\nas I'll just say as a buffer\nto the answer you're about to give,\nthat there's very little\nscience around flow,\nand there's very little neuroscience\nrelated to most\npsychological states anyway.\nSo I think we've got a lot\nof degrees of freedom here.\n- All right, I can breathe easy.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Thank you for that.\n- Anything you like, credit Duncan,\nanything you dislike, send\nthe mean comments to me.\n- Yeah, I think from my data, certainly,\nthe greater the arousal, the\nhigher the performance was\nfrom a physical exertion perspective.\nAnd I think that was the\nintriguing part of some\nof my findings were there's definitely\nan individual biokinetics to some of these\nhormonal kind of releases.\nAnd as much as those\nguys that had the highest\nandrogenic response in\nterms of epinephrin release,\nnorepinephrine release\nalso sustained force output\nfor a longer period of the\nworkout than those that didn't.\nSo, the individuals that\nhad a lower stimulus\nof the sympathetic arousal, let's say,\ncertainly didn't perform as\nwell throughout the workout.\nNow, the intriguing thing\nthen becomes is okay,\nand I think this really segues\ninto what we're doing here\nwith combat athletes, with\nmixed martial artists.\nThere's a philosophy, there's\na paradigm now for myself\nin terms of the exposure, repeat exposure.\nYou know, the more you do\nthat challenging workout,\ndo you get the same\npsychological stimulus?\nDo you still get the same stress response?\nAnd the assumption is unlikely.\nYou accommodate, you become\naccustomed to the stress\nor your body will therefore adapt.\nAnd that's the classic\noverload principle, right?\nYou then need to take the\nstressor down a different route.\nBut I think when you look at the athletes\nthat we work with here,\nit's a fist fight at the end of the day.\nThere's nothing more stressful than that.\nBut I think just the exposure\nto the rigors of training,\nto understand the bad\npositions, the bad situations,\nto know that they can get\nout of certain situations,\nout of certain submission\nholds or whatever it may be,\nI think that really ties\nin with some of my PhD work\nin terms of what these guys do to approach\nwhat is a really\nchallenging sporting arena\nin mixed martial arts.\n- Yeah, it's definitely the\nextreme of what's possible\nin terms of asking does stress\nfavor or hinder performance?\nBecause yeah, like you\nsaid, at the end of the day,\nit's someone trying to hurt you as much\nas they possibly can within\nthe bounds of the rules.\n- Right.\n- And you're trying to do the same.\nSo, I find your thesis work fascinating.\nWere you never to be at the\nUFC Performance Institute,\nluckily they made the right\nchoice and brought you here,\nbut were you have never to come here,\nI was still fascinated by\nthis because over and over\nwe hear that stress is bad,\nstress is bad, stress is bad,\nbut everything I read from\nthe scientific literature\nis that stress and\nepinephrin in particular\nis coupled to the testosterone\nresponse to performance\nand to adaptation, provided\nit doesn't go on too long.\nSo, unless I'm saying\nsomething that violates that.\n- Absolutely, I agree.\n- I mean, that's your work.\nSo it's a really important\nand beautiful work.\nAnd I refer to it often,\nso I'm just glad that-\n- Thank you.\n- We could bolt that down,\nbecause I think the\npeople need to know this,\nthat that discomfort is beneficial.\nNow, there's another side to\nthis that I want to ask about,\nwhich is the use of cold, in particular,\nthings like ice baths, cold showers,\nor any other type of cold\ntemperature exposure.\nIn theory, that's stress\nalso, it's epinephrin.\nAnd so, how should one think about\nthe use of cold for recovery?\nSo, if colds causes stress,\nthen how is cold used for recovery?\nThat's what I don't understand.\nAnd maybe you just want to\nshare your thoughts on that.\n- Yeah, no, and I think\nit's a great question,\nand I think the jury is\nstill out there, certainly,\nknowing some of the conversations\nthat we've been having.\nBut I think, when we talk about stress,\nit's your classic fight,\nflight or freeze approach.\nAnd throwing your body into\na cold tub, an ice bath,\nor whatever it may be\ncertainly is going to have\na physiological stress response.\nNow, people are using that\nfor different end goals.\nAnd again, I think that's\nwhere the narrative\nhas to be explained.\nIf you are using the stress specifically\nto manage the mindset,\nto use it as a specific stress stimulus,\nthat's the same as me\ndoing six by 10 at 80%.\nYou're just trying to find\nsomething to disrupt the system,\nto do something that's very,\nfor want of a better term,\npainful, discomfort, whatever.\nYou're just finding a\nstressor and then being able\nto manage the mindset.\nBut if you're using cold,\nspecifically from a physiological\nperspective to promote\nredistribution of vascularity,\nof blood flow to different\nvascular areas of muscle\nthat you feel have gone through a workout,\nthat are damaged or whatever it may be,\nI think we've got to understand\nwhat that stress mechanism is.\nAnd the data, the literature\nis certainly still out there\nwith respect to\ncryotherapy and cold baths,\nand some of these cold exposures\nin terms of what they do\nat the level of the muscle tissue.\nIf that's the target,\nif you're trying to promote\na flushing mechanism,\nor you're trying to promote redistribution\nof the blood flow,\nwhat you've got to understand\nis that cold is going to\nclamp down every part\nof the vascular system.\nAnd we've really got to\nunderstand how the muscle\nwould be redistributed\nto areas of interest.\nSo, I think the stress\nresponse is a real thing\nwith respect to cold exposure.\nBut I think the narrative around\nwhat are you using the\ncold for has to precede\nthe conversation because yes,\nit's like putting your hand\nover a hot coal.\nThat's a stress the same way as jumping\nin a cold bath is.\n- Yeah, I think most\npeople don't realize that.\nYou're going to get the\nepinephrin release from holding\nyour hand too close to flame.\n- Absolutely.\n- And you're going to get it\nfrom getting in the ice bath.\n- Your body doesn't know\nthe difference, right?\nYour body does not know the difference.\nIt has a primordial kind\nof physiological response\nthat it's created over\nmillions and millions of years.\nAnd I think that that\nphysiology is not changing.\nAnd it's fixed in a\nparticular way right now,\nthat it doesn't understand\nthe difference between whether\nit's six by 10 doing a\nchallenging workout over here,\nwhether it's putting my\nhands on the hot coal,\nwhether there's a lion stood\nin front of me or whatever,\nthat epinephrin response\nfrom the level of the brain\ndown to the whole signaling\ncascade is the same.\n- Mm hm, and cold, I've\nheard can actually prevent\nsome of the beneficial\neffects of training.\nThat it can actually get in the way\nof muscle growth, et cetera.\n- Yeah, there's some pretty\nrobust data out there now\nshowing that it definitely\nhas an influence\non performance variables like strength\nand power in particular,\nbut absolutely in terms\nof muscle hypertrophy.\nAnd there's a big kind\nof theme in the world\nof athletic performance right now,\nin terms of periodization of cold exposure\nas a recovery modality.\n- Interesting.\n- When do you use cold?\nShould you be using cold\nfor recovery in periods\nof high training load when\nyou're actually pursuing,\nit might be general preparatory work,\nor are actually trying\nto pursue muscle growth?\nWell, that's usually where\nyou get the most sore.\nIt's usually where you\nfeel the most fatigued,\nbut it's probably not the\nmost beneficial approach\nto use an ice bath in that scenario,\nbecause you're dampening,\nyou're dulling the mTOR pathway\nand the hypertrophic signaling pathway.\nWhereas in a competition\nphase where actually\nquality of exercise and\nquality of execution of skill\nand technical work has to be maintained,\nyou want to throw the kitchen\nsink of recovery capabilities\nand recovery interventions\nin that scenario\nbecause the muscle building\nactivity should be in the bank.\nThat should have been done in\nthe general preparatory work.\nAnd now you're focusing\non technical execution.\nSo, you're absolutely right.\n- No, it's interesting.\nSo, if I understand correctly,\nif I want to maximize\nmuscle growth or power\nor improvements and adaptations,\nthen the inflammation response,\nthe delayed onset muscle soreness,\nall the stuff that's\nuncomfortable and that we hear\nis so terrible is actually\nthe stimulus for adaptation.\nAnd so, using cold in that situation\nmight short circuit my progress.\nBut if I'm, I don't know\nthat I'll ever do this,\nbut if I were to do an\niron man or something,\nor run a marathon, under those conditions,\nI'm basically coming to\nthe race, so to speak,\nwith all the power and\nstrength I'm going to have.\nAnd so, there, reducing\ninflammation is good\nbecause it's going to allow me to perform\nmore work, essentially.\n- Absolutely, yeah.\nYou have to be strategic\nabout when you use\nsome of these interventions.\nAnd the time when you\npreparing for a competition\nis not the appropriate time...\nExcuse me, is the appropriate\ntime when you want\nto drive recovery and make sure\nthat your body is optimized.\nWhen you're far away\nfrom a competition date\nor out of season or whatever it may be,\nand you're really trying to just tear up\nthe body a little bit, to\nallow its natural healing\nand adaptation processes to take place,\nwell, you don't want to negate that.\nYou want the body to optimize\nits internal recovery\nand that's how muscle growth\nis going to happen, so.\n- So interesting.\n- There's a time kind of\nconsideration that you need to make\nwith these interventions, for sure.\n- At the UFC Performance Center,\nare the fighters periodizing\ntheir cold exposure?\nOr are they just doing cold at will?\n- Well, it's not just the UFC.\nAnd again, I talk about\nmy personal experiences\nwith different sports.\nI think just education\naround where science is at\nand our understanding of concepts\nlike the use of cold exposure\nfor recovery, ice bath.\nEveryone wants to jump in an ice bath.\nBut I think as we've\nstepped back and scientists\nhave started to figure out\nand look at some of the data,\nwe're now more intuitive about, well,\nactually that might not be the best\nor the most optimal approach.\nAnd I think that's any given sport.\nSo, yes, certainly here at the UFC,\nwe're trying to educate\nour athletes around\nappropriate timing.\nAnd it's the same with nutrition,\nit's the same with an\nice bath intervention,\nit's the same with lifting weights,\nit's the same with going for a run\nor working out on the bike.\nThere's tactics to when you do things\nand when you don't do things.\nAnd I think stress and cold exposure,\nwe have to have a consideration\naround that as well,\nbut it's not just MMA\nfighters, that's any athlete.\nAnd I think it's the best professionals,\nthe most successful professionals\ndo that really well.\nThey listen, number one,\nthey educate themselves,\nand then they build structure.\nAnd I think at the most elite level,\nwe always talk about it here at the UFC,\nbut at the most elite level,\nyou're not necessarily training\nharder than anybody else.\nEverybody in the UFC trains hard,\nlike everyone is training super\nhard, but the best athletes,\nthe true elite levels are\nthe ones that can do it\nagain and again and again on a daily basis\nand sustain a technical\noutput for skill development,\ntherefore their skills can improve,\nor physical development,\ntheir physical attributes can improve.\nSo that ability to reproduce\non a day-to-day basis\nfalls into a recovery conversation.\nNow, when is the right\ntime to use something\nlike an ice bath and when isn't,\nis part of the high-performance\nconversation, for sure.\n- So really they're scientists;\nthey're building structure,\nthey're figuring out variables.\n- Yeah.\n- But it sounds like\nthe ability to do more\nquality work over time\nis one of the key variables.\n- I mean, it's fundamental.\nI mean, garbage in, garbage out.\nQuality in, quality out.\nBut in our sport, I talk\nabout mixed martial arts,\nit's truly a decathlon of combat.\nSo there's so many different attributes,\nwhether it's the grappling,\nwhether it's the wrestling,\nwhether it's the transition work,\nwhether it's a standup striking.\nSo, the different facets\nof a training program\nin this sport are significantly large\ncompared to something like\na wide receiver in football.\nAnd that's no disrespect\nfor wide receivers,\nbut they run routes.\nThey're going to run a\nroute, a passing tree,\nand that's all they need to do.\nThese guys have to be on the ground.\nThey've got to be great on the ground.\nThey've got to be great standing up.\nThey've got to be great with\nthe back against the fence.\nSo there's so many different\nkind of facets to our sport.\nSo managing the distribution\nof all the training components\nis one of the biggest\nchallenges of mixed martial arts\nand the best guys get that right.\nThey allow their body to\noptimize the training.\nAnd remember, why are we doing training?\nWe're doing training for technical\nand tactical improvement.\nNow, if your body is\nfatigued or you just can't\nexpose yourself to more\ntactical development\nor technical development,\nthen you're essentially\ndoing yourself a disservice.\nYou're going to be behind the\ncurve with respect to those guys\nthat can reproduce that\nday-in and day-out.\n- On the topic of skill\ndevelopment, regardless of sport,\nwe hear all the time and it\ncertainly is intuitive to me\nthat the person who can focus the best\nwill progress the fastest.\nBut it's kind of interesting,\nsometimes I talk to athletes and they seem\na little bit laid back about\ntheir training sometimes,\nand yet they obviously\nknow how to flip the switch\nand they can really dial in the intensity.\nDo you think that there\nare optimal protocols\nfor skill learning in terms\nof physical skill learning?\nLike, could it ever be parametrized\nlike the six sets of 10 reps?\nAnd this gets to the\nheart of neuroplasticity,\nwhich is still, it's not a black box,\nbut it's kind of a black box\nwith portions of it\nilluminated, I like to say.\nBut what are your thoughts\non skill development?\nFor somebody that wants\nto get better at sport,\ndo you recommend a particularly long\nor short training session?\nDoes intensity matter or is it just reps?\n- Yeah, I think, no, it's\nnot a volume driven exercise.\nIt's a quality driven exercise.\nAnd listen, my expertise\nis not in motor learning\nand motor skill acquisition.\nI tend to default to\nDr. Gabriele Wulf here\nat UNLV for that.\nShe's one of the leading\nproponents in this area.\nBut if you look at true skill development,\nit is about rehearsal\nof accurate movement,\naccurate movement mechanics.\nAnd as soon as that becomes impacted\nby fatigue or inaccurate movement,\nyou're now losing the motor learning,\nyou're losing the accuracy of the skill.\nPeople can call it muscle memory\nor whatever they want, right?\nBut essentially you're\ngrooving neural axons\nto create movement patterns\nand they're situational\nthroughout sport, right?\nWhether it's a Cruyff turn in soccer\nor a jump shot in basketball,\nor a forehand down the line,\nyou can carve out that particular posture\nand position and skill,\nand you can isolate it,\nand you can drill it\nagain and again and again.\nNow, as soon as fatigue is\ninfluencing that repetition,\nit's time to stop.\nAnd the best coaches understand that.\nThey understand that it's\nquality over quantity\nwhen it comes to skill acquisition.\nSo to answer your question\nin a roundabout way,\nI would say, yes, it's shorter sessions\nthat are very high quality.\nAnd I think the best\nathletes in my experience\nare the ones that\nconsciously and cognitively\nare aware of it at every\nmoment of the training session.\nThey should leave the training session\nnot necessarily just physically fatigued,\nbut mentally fatigued because\nthey're completely engaged\nin the learning process.\nThe problem then becomes okay,\nif we just do lots of 30 minutes sessions,\nwe've got to do a lot of\n30 minutes sessions to get\nthe volume exposure of the repetition\nand the rehearsal of this skill\nagain and again and again.\nSo, it's a bit of a paradox.\nIt's a bit of a double-edged sword,\nbut a three hour session\nversus a 90 minute session,\nwe'll take the 90 minute session any day\nwhen it comes to skill acquisition,\nbecause that's going to be\ndriven by quality over quantity.\n- Yeah, training and skill learning\nis incredibly mentally fatiguing.\nI've often wondered why\nwhen one works out hard,\nwhether or not it's with\nrun or with the weights,\nwhy it's hard to think later in the day.\n- Right.\n- Yeah, there really does\nseem to be something to it.\nAnd I've wondered is it depletion\nof adrenaline, dopamine?\nI sometimes think it might be dopamine,\nand here I'm totally speculating.\nI don't have any data to support this,\nbut if you hit a really\nhard workout or run\nearly in the day, oftentimes\nthe brain just doesn't\nwant to do hard mental work.\nWhich gives me great\nadmiration for these athletes\nthat are drilling their mind and body\nall day, every day, with breaks.\nBut so what are your thoughts?\nWhat leads to the mental fatigue\nafter physical performance?\n- Well, again, I don't want to talk out,\nI'm talking to the man here, you know?\n- Well, we're just two scientists-\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Speculating on this point.\nUp until now, you've\nbeen giving us concrete\npeer-reviewed study based\nfeedback on my questions.\nBut if we were to speculate,\nI mean, I think this\nis a common occurrence.\nPeople think if I get that\nreally good workout in\nin the morning, I feel better all day.\n- Right.\n- That's true,\nunless that workout is really\nintense or really long.\n- Yeah.\n- And then you just,\nthe mind just somehow won't\nlatch on to mental work\nquite as well.\n- I mean, just philosophically\nand I think coming back\nto this kind of stress consideration,\nlike public speaking or taking an exam.\nI mean, if you have an amazing\ncoach who is setting up\ntraining in a particular\nway, it's challenging,\nthere's a strain related to it,\nand I'm not talking physical strain,\nI'm talking figuring things\nout, figuring out the skill.\nAnd I think that can be stressful.\nLike the learning\nprocess can be stressful.\nSo, we've touched on stress.\nI also think if they\nhit the right technique,\nthat reward center in the brain,\nthat dopamine shot is\ngoing to fly up there.\nAnd there's only so many\ntimes that we can get that\nbefore that becomes dampened.\nAnd I think there's an\nenergetic piece to it.\nThere's the fueling of the brain.\nThere's the carbohydrate fuel\nin exercise that actually\nthe strategy around how\nyou fuel for learning\nand fuel for physical training\nis actually pretty similar.\n- Glucose.\n- Yeah, it's glucose,\nit's sugar at the end of the day, right?\nSo, are you fueling accordingly\naround your training sessions,\nbe that very physical,\nbecause everyone thinks,\nokay, I'm going to jump on a treadmill\nand I'm going to bang out\n15 sprints at max effort,\nand I'm going to be dropping\noff and laying on the floor\nat the end of it.\nI need to refuel.\nWell, what about the\nrefueling of the brain\nin a very demanding\nexercise or drilling session\nwhere you're looking at technique,\nthat you're trying to figure out,\nthat's very challenging\nfor your mind to figure out\nthe complexity of it,\nthat still needs to be fueled\nor refueled afterwards.\nAnd I think that's obviously\nmight be an area where athletes\ndo themselves a disservice\nby not appropriately fueling\nfrom what might be considered to be\na lower intensity session,\nbut the cognitive challenge\nhas been significantly high.\n- So, they're skill work or drill work,\nand it's taxing the brain.\n- Correct, yeah.\n- And they're thinking, oh,\nI wasn't pushing hard lifts\nor doing sprints, and so I can just go off\ninto the rest of my day, but\nthen their mind is drifting.\n- Yeah, I mean, I speculate.\n- Yeah, that sounds very reasonable.\nI mean, I know that here and presumably\nwith the other athletes\nyou've worked with,\nnutrition is a huge aspect of that.\nAnd I think the general\npublic can learn a lot\nfrom athletic nutrition\nbecause at the end of the day,\nthe general public is trying\nto attend to their kids,\nattend to their work, whether\nor not they're lawyers\nor whatever, they need to focus.\nNutrition is a barbed wire topic.\n- Oh yeah [chuckling].\n- But since we're free\nto do what we would do\nif we were just sitting\nin each other's offices,\nwhich is to just speculate a bit,\nfor the typical person,\ndo you think these low\ncarbohydrate diets...\nA typical person who\nexercises, runs, swims, yoga,\nlifts weights, maybe not all those things,\nbut some collection of those,\npushes themselves to do those\nthings and to do them well,\nbut isn't necessarily a\nhighly competitive athlete.\nDo you think that nutrition\nthat doesn't include\na lot of glucose, doesn't\ninclude a lot of carbohydrates,\nis a problem or is it okay?\nWhat do you recommend for athletes?\nWhat do you recommend for typical people?\n- Yeah, again, disclaimer,\nI'm not a dietician, but I-\n- That's okay, the dieticians don't know\nwhat to recommend to athletes either.\nAnd I say that from\nhaving spent a lot of time\nwith the literature now,\nit's a complete mess.\n- Right, yeah.\n- It's like, I thought\nwe didn't understand\nanything about the brain,\nthe nutrition science stuff\nis all over the place.\n- Right.\n- So I think we have, again-\n- We have some freedom.\n- Large degrees of freedom.\n- Right, right, right.\nI mean, I think it comes\ndown to metabolic efficiency.\nSo we would never advocate a high...\nI never say never, okay?\nBut we rarely advocate a\nhigh performance athlete\nin a high intensity\nintermittent sport, like MMA,\nbeing totally ketogenic or-\n- You do not recommend that?\n- No, because at the end of the day,\nsome of those high intensity\nefforts usually require\ncarbohydrate fueling for\nthe energy that's produced\nat those high intensities.\nSo, we try to navigate around that.\nNow, listen, there are fighters\nin the UFC and elsewhere,\nMatt Brown is a great example,\nwho promotes the ketogenic\napproach and it works for him.\nBut we look at the science and the nature\nof the characteristics of our sport,\nand we don't necessarily promote that.\n- Can I interrupt you real quick?\nWhat about ketones for people\nthat are ingesting carbohydrates?\nThis is an interesting area\nbecause people always hear\nketones and they think,\noh, I have to be ketogenic\nto benefit from taking ketones.\n- Right.\n- But there are a number\nof athletes and recreational\nathletes now as well,\ntaking liquid or powder-based ketones,\neven though they do eat rice and oatmeal\nand bread and other things.\nSo are there any known\nbenefits of ketones,\neven if one is not in a state of ketosis?\n- So, the use of ketones\nthat I'm primarily aware of\nin our sport, is after the event.\nIn terms of the brain health with athletes\nthat are potentially taking\ntrauma to the brain, et cetera,\nand looking to maintain the fueling\nand the energy supply to the brain.\nBut yes, it's probably a\nlittle bit out of my remit.\nSo I don't want to talk\non that because I'm not\nfully familiar with that.\n- Well, I've heard that\nketones after head injury\ncan provide a buffering component.\n- Correct.\n- It's not going to reverse\nbrain damage, but it\nmight be able to offset\nsome of the micro-damage.\n- Right, so that's how we use it,\njust to sustain the\nenergy supply to the brain\nthat might be compromised\nthrough brain trauma.\nSo that's why we use ketones.\nTo come back to your original question.\nIf it's a general population then yes,\nI think there's a place\nto argue that actually\nbeing on a ketogenic diet at times,\nand maybe it's a cycling\nexercise, maybe not...\nI don't mean cycling a\nbike, I mean cycling ketosis\nis beneficial because I\nthink it's going to lead\nto better metabolic management\nand metabolic efficiency,\nat those lower intensities\nwhere we should be fueling\nour metabolism with lipids and fats.\nClearly the Western diet\nand the modern day diet\nis heavily driven by processed\nfoods and carbohydrates\nthat people become\npredisposed to utilization\nof that fuel source\nabove lipid use, fat use,\nat intensities that are very low.\nSo, some of our data with the\nfighters shows that as well.\nBut I think the challenge for\nus is that we're working with\na clientele that require high\nintensity bouts of effort.\nSo, fueling appropriately\nis very important for that.\nNow, we use tactics here where\nwe essentially have athletes\non what you would say,\nkind of is a largely\na ketogenic diet, but then\nwe will fuel carbohydrates\naround training sessions.\nSo, we'll do very timed\nexposure to carbohydrates.\nSo it's not-\n- Post-training?\n- Post-training, immediately pre, during,\nand then immediately post.\nAnd then the rest of their diets,\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner,\nare what would look like\nketogenic type approaches.\nSo we're trying to be very\ntactical in the exposure\nto maximize the intensity for the training\nand then return to a\nmetabolically efficient diet,\nwhich is heavily reduced in carbohydrate\nbecause we've fueled the\nsessions that need it.\n- I'm smiling because\nonce again, this place,\nthe UFC Performance Center is\ndoing things scientifically,\nwhich to me, the idea, and\nI'm pleased to hear that,\nbecause to me this idea\nthat the ketogenic diet\nis the best and only diet or carbohydrates\nand low protein diets are the best diet.\nIt's just, it's ludicrous.\n- Right.\n- Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency.\nI think some people might\nbe familiar with that term,\nsome perhaps not,\nbut the way I understand\nmetabolic efficiency is that\nyou teach the body to\nuse fats by maybe doing\nlong bouts of cardio, maybe\nlowering carbohydrates a bit.\nSo teaching the body to\ntap into its fat stores\nfor certain periods of training.\nAnd then you also teach the\nbody to utilize carbohydrates\nby supplying carbohydrates\nimmediately after training\nand before training.\nYou teach the body to use ketones,\nand then you use them\nat the appropriate time,\nas opposed to just deciding\nthat one of these fuel sources\nis good and all the others\nare bad or dispensable.\nDo I have that correct?\n- You've nailed it.\nI mean, from Bob Seebohar,\nformerly of USA Triathlon,\nis the guy that kind of came up with\nthe concept of metabolic efficiency,\nbut yes, you're absolutely right.\nI mean, at low intensities of exercise\nor just day-to-day living,\nwe shouldn't be tapping into\nour carbohydrate fuel sources extensively.\nThat's for higher intensity work\nor the fight or flight needs of stress.\nIf athletes or any individual\nhas a high carbohydrate diet,\nthey're going to start to\nbecome predisposed to utilizing\nthat fuel source preferentially.\nNow, at low intensity,\nthat can be problematic,\ncertainly for an athlete,\nbecause if they preferentially\nuse carbohydrate\nat lower intensities,\nwhen the exercise demand\ngoes to a higher intensity,\nthey've already exhausted\ntheir fuel stores.\nThey can't draw upon fat\nbecause the oxidation\nof that fat is just too slow.\nSo they're essentially now become fatigued\nbecause they've already utilized\ntheir carbohydrate stores.\nSo what we try to do yes,\nthrough diet manipulation\nand a little bit of exercise\nmanipulation is as you say,\nteach the body or train\nthe body to preferentially\nuse a specific fuel source;\nfat, obviously at lower intensities,\nand carbohydrate at high intensities.\nAnd we will look at\nspecifically the crossover point\nbetween the two, tell us a lot in terms of\nhow an athlete is ultimately,\nhow their metabolism is working.\n- Well, again, I'm smiling\nbecause I love this\nbecause it's grounded in\nsomething real and scientific,\nwhich is that we have these\ndifferent fuel sources.\nThe body can adapt to use any\nnumber of them or one of them.\nI think most people are looking for that\none pattern of eating, that\none pattern of exercising\nthat's going to be best\nfor them or sustain them.\nAnd they often look back\nto the time when they felt\nso much better switching\nfrom one thing to the next,\nbut the adaptation process\nitself is also key, right?\nTeaching the body.\nSo if we were to just riff on this\njust a little bit further, if somebody,\nI'll use myself as an example,\nsince I can only speculate\nwhat other people's\ncurrent nutrition protocols are,\nbut if somebody is eating\nin a particular way\nand they want to try this kind\nof periodization of nutrition,\ncould one say, okay, for a\nfew weeks I'm going to do more\nhigh intensity interval\ntraining and weight training,\nand I'm going to eat a\nbit more carbohydrate\n'cause I'm depleting more glycogen.\nThen if I switch to a phase\nof my training where I'm doing\nsome longer runs, maybe I'm training less,\nmaybe I'm just working at\nmy desk a little bit more,\nthen I might switch to a\nlower carbohydrate diet.\nDo I have that right?\nAnd then if I'm going to enter\na competition of some sort,\ncertainly not UFC-\n- Right.\n- Or MMA of any kind to be clear,\nnot because it isn't a wonderful sport,\nbut because that wouldn't be\ngood for my other profession.\nBut if I were going to do that,\nthen I would think about\nstacking carbohydrates,\nketones, and fats.\nDo I have that more or less right?\n- Yeah, you've said it eloquently.\nAt the end of the day, you're\nconsciously understanding\nwhat the exposure to physical exertion is,\nand you're flexing your day\naccordingly and I think that-\n- So, it's need-based eating.\n- Exactly, for want of a better term,\nyou can call it whatever fancy terminology\nthere is out there, but yes,\nit's needs-based eating,\nbut you're very conscious and cognizant\nof what is my current exercise status.\nIf I'm taking some time off,\nthen don't gorge on the carbohydrates.\nWe probably need to be cut,\nit's going to be lower intensity work,\nor even just habitual\nday-to-day walking around,\ndoing your groceries.\nThat doesn't require massive\namounts of glycogen storage\nand carbohydrate fueling.\nSo, you can potentially go\nmore ketogenic in nature,\noxidizing lipids for that fuel.\nIf you are in a high period\nof high intensity training,\nthen you have to consciously\nflex your diet to support that.\nThat's not normal, you've made a change,\nyou've elevated the demand.\nSo, the fueling requirements\nfor the regenerative,\nnot only fueling the exercise,\nbut the regenerative\nrequirements of your body\nafter that type of work is going to be\nreally important as well.\nSo, yes, take on more carbohydrates.\nSo, I think it's consciously\ninterpreting the nature\nof your diet against where\nyou are at any moment in time.\n- Yeah, I like that.\nI think the listeners of my podcast\ngenerally are experimenters.\n- Right.\n- They are scientists of themselves,\nwhich makes me happy obviously.\nAnd I like to think that\nthey're paying attention\nto the changes they're making\nand how they're affecting themselves.\nAnd they seem more open to trying things,\nprovided they can do it safely,\nand seeing what works for them.\nAnd I'm certainly going to\ntry some of the change up.\nI also am really a creature of habit.\nAnd I think that talking to you today,\nI realize I'm probably\ndoing a number of things\ntruly wrong in my training,\nbut also that I don't\ntend to vary my nutrition\nwith my training quite\nas much as I should.\nI'm just locked into a protocol.\nWe covered a number of things related\nto your PhD thesis work,\nbut I cut you off early on\nrelated to your trajectory.\nAfter you finished your thesis.\n- Yeah.\n- I know you were\nat Notre Dame for a while.\nWas that your first spot\nafter your PhD thesis?\n- No, no, I basically finished my PhD\nand I dropped into the\nBritish Olympic system\nfor about 14 years.\n- Oh my, okay.\n- I've done three full Olympic\ncycles with different sports,\nlargely as strength and conditioning coach\nas a practitioner.\nI was always working in\nuniversities and academia alongside,\nin terms of continuing\nto publish and write\nand do research and teach as well.\n'Cause I enjoy teaching.\n- That explains the huge\nvolume of publications.\n- Yeah [chuckling].\n- I don't think people\nrealize all the work\nthat goes into getting a quality\npeer-reviewed publication.\nIt's not, what do they call\nit now on Instagram, anecdata?\nWhere people would do something once.\n- Right.\n- They have this experience\nand then they put it in\nthe world that it's a-\n- Yeah.\n- Anecdata are,\nI don't even know that\nwe should call it data.\nSo, 14 years in working with\nthe British Olympic team.\n- Yeah, so whether it was GB boxing,\nprimarily with the Beijing cycle,\nbut also lightweight\nrowers and gymnastics.\nAnd for the London Olympic games,\nthat cycle I was the lead\nstrength and conditioning\nand physical performance\ncoach for British basketball.\nSo, GB basketball.\nI had about three years in\nthe English Premier League\nwith Newcastle United and the soccer team,\nand then for the Rio Olympic cycle,\nI was with Great Britain Tae Kwon Do.\nSo, again, another combat sport.\nAfter I'd finished there,\nI kind of moved to the\nUniversity of Notre Dame,\nwhere I went into more\nof a managerial position\nworking across all the\ndifferent technical services;\nmedical, nutrition,\nstrength and conditioning,\nsports psychology and sports\nscience, whatever it may be,\nas the Director of Performance Sciences\nfor Notre Dame athletics.\nAnd then, after about 16 months there,\nthe UFC came knocking\nand they recruited me\nout of Notre Dame.\nSo, it's been a great ride,\nand I've got lots of\nathletes have taught me\na lot along the way, lots of coaches.\nEvery day is a school day,\nI still try and keep that mentality.\nAnd in this world we call\nit white belt mentality.\nI'm a PhD, I've got 25 years of experience\nin high performance\nsport, but I still learn\nevery single day from these\npeople out on the mats\nand in the ring and it's\nimpressive to see what they do.\n- Yeah, it certainly is.\nI got introduced to MMA\njust a few years ago.\nI think the first time I came\nout here was one of the first\ntimes I'd heard of MMA\n'cause I was kind of\nin my laboratory, nose down.\nAnd it's a really interesting\nsport because it incorporates\nso many different types\nof movement as you said-\n- Right.\n- It's not just\nstand up boxing, it's not just kicking,\nit's ground game, everything,\nand I'm still learning about it.\nBut as you mentioned, going\nin with that beginner's mind,\nthe white belt mentality,\nwhat has been the most\nsurprising thing for you\nin terms of being exposed\nto MMA in particular,\nas opposed to other sports?\nLike what's unique about MMA fighters,\nbesides that they have this\nhuge variety of tactical skills\nthat they have to learn and perfect?\n- Yeah, that's a great question.\nI would say two things.\nI'm going to answer two questions.\nOne actually reiterates\nwhat you've already said.\nLike the degrees of freedom\nin mixed martial arts\nare exponential, like no other sport.\nWe've got 11 different weight classes.\nWe have men's classes.\nWe have women's classes.\nWe have kickboxers,\nwrestlers, jujitsu fighters,\njudoka, karate fighters.\nThe stylistic backgrounds are infinite.\nWe're a weight classification sport.\nThere's a whole issue\nrelating to making weight\nand then rebounding to\nfight about 24 to 30 hours.\nLike just the variability in this sport,\nthe considerations that you\nhave to make are unprecedented\ncompared to any other sport\nthat I've worked with.\nAnd a lot of them go against\nand are the antithesis\nof what you would expect\nfor high performance.\nIn terms of we don't\nalways have a very clearly\ndefined competition schedule.\nOnce these guys fight,\nthey don't necessarily know\nwhen their next fight is going to be.\n- What's the closest spacing of a fight?\n- I mean, listen, I think\nthe record is around,\nit's just over a month, I believe.\n- Oh, my goodness.\n- So, you know, that's a quick turnaround,\nbut most of these guys are fighting\nthree or four times a year,\nthree times a year is pretty normal.\nThe bigger fighters,\nmaybe two times a year.\nBut invariably, the guys\ndon't know when that next date\nis going to be.\nSo we're in this gray area\nof, okay, what do we do?\nLike, are we taking some time off?\nAre we just going to do\nsome general prep work?\nAre we going to try and keep the\nknife sharpened in case I get-\n- I didn't realize this.\nIn that way it's a lot\nlike special operations.\n- Absolutely, you don't know when the call\nis going to happen.\n- They have to be ready\nat all times.\nThere isn't this, like, let's\nget ready for the season.\n- Right, yeah.\nLike when I was with the\nBritish Olympic Association,\nI knew it was the British\nOpen, the Spanish Open,\nthe French Open, the\nEuropean Championships,\nthe Israeli Open, the American Open,\nthe Canadian Open, the Olympic games.\n- It's a circuit in your brain.\n- Right, yeah.\n- I can tell, yeah.\n- You just plan like you know\nwhere all the targets are going to be.\nHere, it's a moving\ntarget because you might\nbe just hanging out doing\nsome general prep work,\nand then you might get\na short notice fight.\nThey give you a quick call\nand it's in six weeks or five weeks.\nAnd okay, I've got to ramp\neverything up really quickly.\nSo, that's a real challenge\nin terms of just managing\nall these different components\nof a mixed martial arts alone.\nTo come back to your question,\nthe other thing which is truly fascinating\nabout these individuals is\njust their mental resilience.\nAnd again, we've touched\non it in the talk,\nbut the ability to do what\nthey do on a daily basis,\nto look at all the different skillsets\nthat they have to try and engage in\nand bring into their training.\nTo do that and embrace the grind,\nembrace the process of just learning,\nthe physical side of our\nsport is unprecedented.\nBut the mental side, we\nhave a funny saying here.\nWe always say it's 90% mental\napart from the 60% that's physical.\nSo, it's just more and more and more.\nAnd these guys' ability to\njust do that on a daily basis\nis very impressive.\nLike their resilience,\ntheir internal drive\nand their resilience is\nreally impressive to see.\n- Yeah, all the fighters I've met here\nhave been really terrific.\nIt's interesting every\ntime I meet a fighter,\nI shouldn't be surprised when they're\noften very soft-spoken.\n- Right.\n- [Andrew] They're\nalways extremely polite.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- You know?\nAnd fighting is such a...\nIt comes from a very primitive\nportion of the brain, right?\nBut a large portion of\nthe brain, nonetheless.\n- But I think that's another\nskill is that switch.\nAnd again, that's the\nrecoverability piece, right?\nLike you cannot be Taipei\nor you cannot be like super\ncharged 24 hours a day\nbecause you're going to\njust fry your system, right?\nAnd I think that's something\nelse where we're really trying\nto manage this whole process,\nbe it through nutritional interventions,\nbe it through education around sleep,\nbe it through training program management,\nbe it through psychological interventions.\nYou could look at fighters and\nsay like, these guys are go,\nlike they're red alert and\nthey'll run through a brick wall,\nbut actually again, their\nability to turn it on and off\nmeans that they can do what they do.\nThey can bring it down and be very normal,\nvery polite, very accommodating.\n- Maybe even better than most people\nbecause one of the reasons I'm obsessed\nwith human performance,\nand high-performance,\nand people like fighters,\nand elite military,\nor even bodybuilders for that\nmatters that they experiment.\n- Yeah.\n- They find the outer\nlimits of what's possible.\nBut one of the things\nthat they have discovered,\nas you're describing, is\nthis ability to toggle\nbetween high alert states and calm states.\nMost typical people can't do this.\nThey see something that\nupsets them on the internet\nor something on the news\nor some external event\npressures down on them\nand they're stressed\nfor many, many days and weeks,\nand sometimes it goes pathological, right?\nAnd I don't say this as a criticism,\nit's just that most human\nbeings, within our species,\nmost members of our species never learn\nto either flip the switch\nor to just voluntarily\ntoggle between states.\nI think athletes learn how\nto do that extremely well.\nAnd it sounds like MMA\nfighters do that even better\nthan perhaps many other athletes.\n- I mean, yeah, there's the odd one or two\nthat would struggle with,\nbut I think in terms of\nthat chronic exposure,\nwe see that coming from challenges around\ncyclical weight cutting,\nand metabolic disruption,\nand metabolic injury,\nnot necessarily from\nthe psychological drive.\nThey do understand that\nthis is a job for them.\nAnd the time on the mats,\nmost of them can turn it off a little bit\nand downgrade things when\nthey're off the mats.\nIt's impressive to see, because again,\nlike, as a layman, just\nlooking at the fight game,\nyou think it's going to be crazy chaotic,\n100 miles an hour every hour of every day,\nbut that's clearly not the case.\nThey manage their energy and\ntheir efforts pretty well.\n- So it's a little bit like science.\nAlthough maybe scientists\ncould take a lesson from-\n- Yeah, that evidence-based practice\nor practice-based evidence, right?\n- Oh, I like that.\n[Duncan chuckling]\nThat's good.\nA couple more questions,\nI can't help myself.\nI know we talked about temperature earlier\nwhen we discussed cold,\nbut I can't help myself,\nI have to ask you about heat.\nBecause earlier we were\nhaving a conversation\nabout heat adaptation,\nabout how long does it take\nfor the human body or\nathlete or typical person\nthat's maybe exploring\nsauna or things of that sort\nto learn to be a better sweater?\nIt sounds like something\nnone of us would want to do.\nWe all want to stay\ncool, calm and collected.\nBut one of the reasons to deliberately\nexpose oneself to heat is for things\nlike growth hormone release, et cetera.\nWe can talk about this,\nbut a couple of questions.\nOne, is heat exposure\nstress in the same way\nthat the ice bath or\ncold exposure is stress?\nThe second one is, is there any difference\nthere that's important?\nAnd the other one is\nhow does one get better\nat heat adaptation or at\nleast what are you doing\nwith the fighters to get them\nbetter at dealing with heat?\nHow long does that take?\nSo the first question,\njust 'cause I threw\nthree questions at you,\n[Duncan chuckling]\nis heat stress like cold is stress?\n- Yeah, I think it is.\nAnd I think heat shock\nproteins for example,\nare driven by that stressful exposure\nto a change in environment.\nSo, I think we do graded response in terms\nof heat acclimation strategies, but yes,\nwe've touched on it earlier\nin the conversation.\nFor me, heat is still a stressor.\nAnd if it's managed incorrectly,\nyou can have detrimental responses\nrather than beneficial responses.\n- So barring like hyperthermia and death,\nlike I mean, obviously you\nheat up the brain too much,\npeople will have seizures and\ndie, but you lose neurons.\nBut what's the right\nway to acclimate heat?\nTaking into account\nthat people should check\nwith their doctor, et cetera.\nWe do all these disclaimers,\nbut let's just say,\nI want to get better at dealing with heat,\nor I want to extract\nmore benefit from heat.\nI mean, how many minutes a day are people\ntypically exposing themselves to heat?\nHow often and over what periods of time?\n- Yeah, so, we normally start with\nabout 15 minutes of exposure.\nNow, if someone's really\nlacking acclimation to heat,\nyou can do that in three,\nfive minute efforts.\nDo you know what I mean?\nAnd actually take-\n- This is a hot sauna?\n- [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna,\ntake time to step out-\n- 200 degrees or something like it?\n- Correct, yeah.\n- Fahrenheit, yeah.\n- 200 Fahrenheit, yes.\nAnd we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes\nto 45 minutes in the sauna continuous.\nNow, we have to understand,\nwhat's the advantage of heat\nacclimation for our athletes?\nUltimately their ability to\nsweat and to lose body fluids\nis going to be advantageous\nto their weight cut process.\nSo, their ability to make weight.\nIt is a technique that\nsome of these guys adopt.\nSo, if you don't have high sweat rates,\nit means you're going to\nhave to sit in the sauna\nfor longer and longer and longer\nto get the same delta in sweat release.\nSo the more acclimated you are,\nthe more your body is\nthermogenically adapted,\nthe more sweat glands you\nhave, there's more pores,\nyou can sweat more and\ntherefore you'll lose\nthat fluid quicker, and you\nspend less time in the sauna.\nSo, that's why we do it,\nto try and promote...\nTo limit the exposure.\nAnd it comes back to your first\nquestion, is it a stressor?\nIt absolutely it's a stressor\nif you've got to spend\ntwo hours over a four hour period,\ntwo hours of it sat in a sauna.\n- Yeah, where the phone-\n- Because you just don't\nsweat enough.\n- Doesn't work, so you can't.\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n- Right.\n- People, divorce them from their phone\nand that's a stressor in itself.\n- Right, I mean, yes, I think there's a...\nWhat we do is like anything,\nwe build up in temperature,\nbut we build up in volume of exposure.\nSo, we start with 15 minutes\nand then we just try to add on\nand add on across a time.\nAnd now, for us, we kind of\nfound about 14 sauna exposures\nstarts to really then\ndrive the adaptations\nthat we're looking for.\nSo it's not a quick fix.\nA heat acclimation strategy\nhas to happen long before\nfight week or long before the fights.\nThis is a process that has\nto begin eight to 10 weeks\nbefore the fight so that we can actually\nget that adaptation and that\ntolerance to the stressor,\nto the exposure of heat.\n- This is interesting, until today,\nwhen we were talking about\nthis earlier, and again now,\nI didn't realize that,\nbut it makes perfect\nsense now that I hear it,\nthat heat adaptation is possible,\nthat you basically can train the body\nto become better at cooling itself,\nwhich is what sweating is.\n- Yeah.\n- I mean, I should have known that before,\nbut you don't see that in\nthe textbooks and so, yeah.\n- I mean, listen, it's the same\nas the ketogenic conversation.\nYou're training your body to\nbe more metabolic efficient,\nyou're training your body\nto tolerate heat more,\nyou're training your body...\nLike the body as an organism,\nas an organic system,\nit's hugely adaptable,\nit's hugely plastic.\nBut I think the skill is\nunderstanding the whens,\nthe whys and the whereofs in\nterms of changing the overload,\nchanging the stimulus to\ndrive specific adaptation.\nAnd philosophically that's\nhow we go about our work here.\nWe talk about adaptation-led programming.\nNow, adaptation-led programming fits into\nevery single category,\nnot just lifting weights\nor running track.\nIt fits into nutrition.\nIt fits into sitting in the sauna.\nIt fits into being in a cold bath or not.\nIt fits into so many\ndifferent things because\nwe're driven by scientific insights.\nAnd that's how we really want\nto go about our business.\n- I love it, I love this concept\nof adaptation-led\nprogramming and doing that,\nnot just in the context of\nthrowing another plate on the bar\nor something like that,\nbut in every aspect of one's\ntraining and performance.\nAnd I think there's a lot\nhere that's applicable\nto the recreational athlete, too.\n- Yeah.\n- Would you say that,\nwhat comes to mind is 12 weeks.\nIt feels like 12 weeks is a\nnice block of time for someone\nto try something in terms\nof to try something new,\nsee how they adapt, adapt,\nand then maybe switch to something new.\nI realized that it's very\nhard to throw a kind of pan\ntimeframe around something,\nbut in terms of if someone\nwanted to experiment with heat adaptation\nor experiment with cold adaptation\nor change up their\ntraining regimen or diet,\nand look at metabolic efficiency,\ndo you think 12 weeks\nis a good period of time\nto really give something a thorough go?\nAnd gain an understanding of how well\nor how poorly something works for oneself?\nOr would you say eight is enough?\nOr three?\n- I mean, that's the how\nlong is a piece of string\nkind of response, right?\n- Yeah.\n- I mean, yes, if we're just\ntalking arbitrary numbers-\n- Recreational experimenter.\n- Yeah, like three months\nexposure, 12 week training strategy,\n12 week intervention is\nmore than adequate to say\nfor 99% of things that\nchange within the body,\nthat physiologically adapt\nto a training stimulus\nor an overload stimulus,\nyou're going to start to see\neither regression or progression,\nbeneficial or detrimental\neffects within three months.\nAbsolutely, I would say so.\nNow, listen, I say that in as\nmuch as we do training blocks\nhere that are three weeks long.\n- Right, well, that's\nbecause of this constraint\nthat sometimes people suddenly have to,\nthey get the call to fight.\n- Correct, yeah.\nSo it's like super condensed.\nAnd in that scenario,\nwe're always conscious of is\ntheir body or this individual,\ndo they have the ability to\ntolerate that super overload,\nthat super condensed exposure?\nNow, we might be doing that purposefully.\nWe might be trying to do\nan overreaching strategy\nwhere we're really trying\nto damage or flex something.\nAnd I don't mean like negatively damage,\nbut like we're trying to damage tissue\nto really get an adaptive\nresponse versus a more drawn out\n12 week strategy, which is more coherent,\nmore planned out, more\nstructured in nature.\nBut yeah, for all your listeners,\nI would say 12 weeks\nto engage in a process\nof trying to change and adapt your body\nor expose yourself to something\nis more than sufficient\nto see if it's going to be\nthe right approach for you.\nAnd I think, the\nindividual interpretation,\nit always has to be considered.\nAnd I think that's where\nit comes back to be\na thinking man's athlete or\nbe a thinking man's trainer,\nlike someone that's\ngoing through exercise,\nyou have to consciously\nunderstand where your body's at\nany moment in time, you know?\nYou've got to be real with yourself.\nYou create a journal, create\na log of your training,\ncreate a log of your feelings,\nyour subjective feedback\nof how you felt, your mood, your sleep.\n- Do your athletes do that?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nWe try to promote that because again,\nthat's part of this process, you know?\nIt might be 12 weeks for you,\nbut I might get the same\nresponses in eight weeks.\nAnd I think that's another\ncritical theme here is that\nwe could put 15 guys on the mat\nand give them the same workout,\nand there's going to be\n15 different responses\nto that same workout\nbecause the human organism\nis so complex.\nAnd in nature, it's going\nto adapt differently.\nSome people will tolerate it.\nSome people are going\nto be challenged by it.\nSome people have got a metabolic makeup\nthat's going to promote it.\nSome people are metabolically\nchallenged by it.\nThere's just so many different things\nthat we have to consider.\nAnd that's what we try to do here.\nIt's the cross we bear is\nthat we try to understand\non an individual level how to\noptimize athletic performance.\n- I think it's terrific,\nand the athletes here are\nso fortunate to have this.\nAnd most people out there,\nI've certainly been\ntrying to encourage people\nto learn some science and some mechanism\nand become scientists\nof their own pursuits,\nwhether or not skill learning\nor athletic pursuit, et cetera.\nAs sort of a final question,\nwhat are some things about\nthe UFC or something about\nthe UFC that perhaps people don't know\nin terms of its overall mission\nor what you guys are trying to do here?\nI mean, I think, I've become a fan of MMA\nand I am more and more as time moves on.\nSome people might be into MMA,\nsome people not into watching MMA,\nbut what are some things\nthat the UFC is interested in\nand doing that most people\nmight not know about,\nand certainly I might not know about?\n- Yeah, I mean, I think,\nwe try to be cutting edge.\nWe try to be super progressive.\nWe think we've got an\namazing platform here,\nparticularly at the Performance Institute\nto do some really cool things that can\ninform many different people.\nAnd that doesn't just mean\nthe 600 or so athletes\nthat are on our global roster.\nWhat we're trying to do is,\nis influence global community\naround optimizing human performance.\nSo, any moment in time,\nwe're engaging in different technologies\nwith different vendors,\ndifferent partners,\nexploring opportunities\nto learn more, share data,\nunderstand what's the best mechanisms\nfor interpreting your body,\ninterpreting how your body's\nresponding to training,\ninterpreting your nutrition\nor whatever it may be.\nWe're in a really privileged\nposition to do that.\nBut we've also, hence\nyou being here today,\nwe're also trying to venture\ninto some really cool areas\nof science and research\nthat's got applicability,\nthat you can take from\nhigh performance athletes\nand apply to yourself, to Joe\nBlow walking down the street,\nout there that is really interesting.\nAnd that's everything\nfrom whether it's CBD\nand psychedelics, through\nto different technologies\nfor thermal monitoring and\nBluetooth heart rate monitoring\nor whatever it may be,\nthrough to data management, et cetera,\nand anything in between.\nWe've got some great partners\non the nutrition side,\non the psychology side, on the data side.\nAnd I think we always try\nto just push the envelope\na little bit more.\nI think we keep our core\nmission with our athletes,\nbut I think a lot of what\nwe do, hence your podcast,\nan amazing platform, you\ndo such a great job of it,\nthat we can all learn\nand take from the elite\nand interpret how it might help us,\nand just in the general population.\nSo, I think that's our north\nstar is to provide our athletes\nthe best integrated service of care,\nbut we also want to influence\njust the global community\nand put the UFC at the forefront of that.\n- That's great, well, you\nguys are certainly doing it,\nand we can't let the cat\nout of the bag just yet.\nBut the things that we're gearing up\nto do with my laboratory-\n- Yeah, I'm excited.\n- And the work together,\nhopefully we'll be able\nto talk about that and share\nthat in the year to come,\nbut we're very excited about that.\nAnd, Duncan, look, I have\nthis filter that I use\nwhen I talk to people,\nacademics or otherwise,\nwhich is some people,\nthey open their mouth,\nand it doesn't make much difference,\nbut when you speak, I learn so much.\nI'm going to take the protocols\nthat I've heard about today,\nI'm going to think about how I'm training\nand how I could train\ndifferently and better,\nhow I'm eating, how I could\neat differently and better\nfor sake of performance\nand just in general.\nThank you so much for your\ntime, your scientific expertise,\nthe stuff you're doing in the\npractical realm, it's immense.\nSo, hopefully we can do it again.\n- Yes, thank you.\nThis has been a blast.\nI appreciate it and yeah,\nkeep doing what you're doing\n'cause I know there's a\nlot of people out there\nthat love the platform.\nSo, thanks for the invite.\nIt's been awesome.\n- Oh, thank you.\nThanks so much.\nThank you for joining\nme for my conversation\nwith Dr. Duncan French.\nI hope you found it as insightful\nand informative as I did.\nIf you're enjoying

level that you like.\nMany previous episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nwe discuss supplements;\nsupplements for sleep,\nsupplements for focus and for\nother health benefits as well.\nWhile supplements may\nnot be for everybody,\nif you're going to use supplements,\nyou want to make sure\nthat those supplements\nare of the very highest quality.\nFor that reason, we've partnered\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne supplements are\nof the very highest quality\nand the amounts of ingredients\nlisted on the label\nof Thorne supplements precisely matches\nwhat is actually contained\nin those capsules,\nbottles and pills and\npowders and so forth.\nThis is extremely important.\nA lot of analysis of supplements\nand supplement companies\nhave shown that what's listed\non the bottle is often not\nwhat's actually contained in the bottle.\nThorne's stringency is unmatched.\nThey've partnered with all\nthe major sports teams,\nwith the Mayo Clinic.\nAnd so, there's a lot of\ntrust in Thorne supplements\nfor all the right reasons.\nIf you'd like to try Thorne supplements,\nyou can see the supplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman.\nThere, you can see the\nsupplements that I take.\nYou can get 20% off any\nof those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate into the Thorne site\nthrough that portal, you can get 20% off\nany of the supplements that Thorne makes.\nI'd also like to mention\nthat if you're not already\nfollowing us on Instagram @hubermanlab,\nyou might want to do so.\nThere I do brief science\ntutorials and offer science-based\nprotocols for all sorts of\nthings that are often separate\nfrom the protocols and information\ncovered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nWe're also on Twitter as hubermanlab.\nAnd last and certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[light music]"
