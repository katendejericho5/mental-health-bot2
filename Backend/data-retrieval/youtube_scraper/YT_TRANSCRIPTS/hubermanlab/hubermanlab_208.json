    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford school of medicine.\nToday, we are going to talk\nall about attention deficit,\nhyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.\nWe are also going to talk\nabout normal levels of focus.\nWhat are normal levels of\nfocus and how all of us,\nwhether or not we have ADHD\nor not can improve our ability\nto focus our ability to\nrule out distraction.\nIt turns out those are\ntwo separate things,\nas well as remember information better.\nWe are also going to talk about\nhow we can learn to relax while focusing,\nwhich turns out to be a critical\ncomponent of learning new\ninformation and for coming\nup with new creative ideas.\nSo whether or not you have\nADHD or know someone who does,\nor if you're somebody who feels\nthat they do not have ADHD,\nbut would simply like to\nimprove their ability to focus\nor to be more creative.\nThis episode is definitely\nfor you as well.\nWe are going to talk\nabout drug based tools\nthat are out there.\nWe are going to talk\nabout behavioral tools.\nWe will talk about the role\nof diet and supplementation,\nand we will talk about new emerging\nbrain machine interface devices,\nthings like transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation.\nIf you don't know what\nthat is, don't worry,\nI will explain it to you.\nThese are non-invasive methods\nfor rewiring your brain\nin order to make focusing\nmore natural for you\nand to teach you how to\nincrease your depth of focus.\nNow, just a quick reminder\nthat any time we discuss\na psychiatric disorder,\nit's important that we remember\nthat all of us have the\ntemptation to self-diagnose\nor to diagnose others.\nSo, as I list off some of\nthe symptomology of ADHD,\nsome of that symptomology\nmight resonate with you.\nYou might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD\nor you might decide that someone you know,\ndefinitely has ADHD.\nHowever, it is very important\nthat you don't self-diagnose\nor diagnose somebody else\nthe clear and real diagnosis of ADHD\nreally should be carried out\nby a psychiatrist, a physician,\nor a very well-trained\nclinical psychologist.\nThere are clear criteria\nfor what constitutes\nfull-blown ADHD.\nHowever, many of us have\nconstellations of symptoms\nthat make us somewhat\nlike somebody with ADHD\nand if you're struggling\nwith focus nowadays,\nas a lot of people are because of stress,\nbecause of smartphone use,\nwhich turns out can induce adult ADHD.\nWe'll talk about that.\nWe'll then pay attention\nto the symptomology.\nYou may actually require\nprofessional treatment\nyou might not,\nequally important is to remember\nthat some of the terms that we cover,\nlike impulse control and\nattention and concentration\nare somewhat subjective and\nthey can change over time.\nSometimes we have a better\nlevel of attention than others.\nMaybe it depends on how we slept\nor other events going on in our life\nwhere something that\nwe're entirely unaware of.\nThe important thing to remember\nis that we can all improve\nour attentional capacity.\nWe can all rewire the circuits\nthat make heightened levels\nof focus, more accessible to us.\nWe can do that through multiple\ntypes of interventions,\nand we are going to cover all\nthose interventions today.\nBefore we march into the material,\nI'd like to remind that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nAnd keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the utmost quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system\nand I can tell you that\nthere are many features\nbuilt into our visual system\nthat allows us to see things clearly,\nwhether or not we are in shade\nor bright sunlight, et cetera.\nA lot of sunglasses have the problem\nthat you have to constantly take them off\nand put them back on again,\nbecause of changes in background\nluminance, as we call it,\nRoka, sunglasses have solved this problem.\nIt doesn't matter if you're\nstanding in tree shade\nor a bright light, or what have you,\nyou can always see things\nwith perfect clarity\nand that shows that they really understand\nthe way that the visual system works\nand their eyeglasses\nare built accordingly.\nI wear readers at night,\nso I wear eye glasses to read at night,\nor when I drive at night and their readers\nand eyeglasses are terrific as well.\nOne thing I like so much\nabout their eyeglasses\nand their sunglasses\nis that despite being,\n\"Performance glasses\" mean\nyou can wear them on running\nor swimming or biking, they\ndon't fall off your face,\neven if you get sweaty,\nthey're very lightweight.\nYou don't even notice that they're on\nis that the aesthetic is really good.\nA lot of performance glasses,\nthey look kind of ridiculous, frankly,\nthey make people look like cyborgs,\nbut their aesthetics are terrific,\nthey have a lot of different styles,\nyou can select from.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything\nabout their sunglasses\nand eyeglasses were designed\nwith optical clarity\nand performance in mind.\nIf you'd like to try Roca,\nyou can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Belcampo.\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic grass fed\nand finished certified humane meat.\nI tend to eat meat about once a day.\nSo typically I'll fast\nuntil about noon or one\nand then my lunch consists\nof a small piece of steak\nor chicken and some salad\nand then I tend to eat my\ncarbohydrates in the evening\nbefore I go to sleep.\nSometimes and especially\nlately I'm eating my protein\nearlier in the day\nbecause I'm playing around\nwith some of the findings\nrelated to protein\nintake early in the day.\nBut regardless, I'm eating\nmeat about once a day.\nFor me, it's extremely important\nthat any meat that I consume\ncome from humanely raised animals\nand that the meat be of\nthe very highest quality.\nSo with Belcampo meets the\nanimals graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses,\nwhich results in meats,\nthat's much higher in\nnutrients and healthy fats,\nincluding omega-3s,\nwhich I've talked a lot\nabout on this podcast,\nthe importance of\nomega-3s for heart health,\nfor brain health, for mood, et cetera.\nPersonally, I love their rib eye steaks,\ntheir New York steaks,\ntheir chicken is terrific\nand I also liked the organic meatballs.\nAll the elk meat is organic and grass fed,\nand grass-finished, if\nyou'd like to try Belcampo,\nfirst time customers can get 20% off\nby going to belcampo.com/Huberman\nand using the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix sleep.\nHelix sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are absolutely second to none.\nI started sleeping on a\nHelix mattress about eight,\nnine months ago, and I've\nnever slept better in my life.\nIf you go to the Helix site,\nthey have a short two minute quiz,\nand that quiz asks you questions like,\ndo you sleep on your back?\nDo you sleep on your side?\nDo you sleep on your stomach?\nDo you tend to run hot or cold\nin the middle of the night?\nMaybe you don't know\nand they actually have an\noption to select, I don't know\nand Helix will match you to a mattress\nthat specific to your sleep needs.\nIt turns out to be really important.\nSome people have the tendency to run hot\nand sleep on their stomach.\nOther people lie on their back\nand they're waking up cold\nin the middle of the night.\nSo you really need a mattress\nthat's matched to your sleep needs.\nI did that and I matched to\nthe dusk mattress, D-U-S-K\nand it turns out to be perfect\nfor me and my sleep needs\nas well their pillows are really terrific.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minutes sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you\nto a customized mattress\nand you'll get up to $200\noff any of their mattresses\nand you'll get two free\npillows with your order.\nThey have a 10 year warranty.\nYou have to try it out\nfor 100 nights risk-free\nit's more than three months\nand if you don't like it,\nthey'll pick it up for you\nand they'll take it away\nand you get all your money back.\nSo if you're interested, go\nto helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off your\nmattress and two free pillows.\nSo let's talk about ADHD,\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\nLet's also talk about focus and attention\nand everybody's ability\nto focus and attend\nnot just people with ADHD.\nWe are also going to talk about tools\nthat would allow anyone,\nwhether or not they have ADHD or not\nto enhance their level of\nconcentration and focus.\nNow, ADHD used to be called\nADD Attention Deficit Disorder.\nWe have record of ADD in\nthe medical literature\ndating back to as early as 1904.\nNow there's nothing special about 1904.\nThat's just the first\ntime that it showed up\nin the standard medical literature.\nWe have to believe that ADD,\nwhich we now call ADHD existed before 1904\nand probably long before 1904, why?\nWell, because it has a\nstrong genetic component.\nIf you have a close\nrelative that has ADHD,\nthere's a much higher probability\nthat you will have ADHD\nand that probability goes\nup depending on how closely\nrelated to that person you happen to be.\nSo for instance,\nif you're an identical twin\nand your twin has ADHD,\nthere's a very high concordance as we say,\na very high probability\nthat you will have ADHD\nup to 75% chance.\nIf you have a fraternal twin with ADHD,\nthat number goes down a\nbit in the 50 to 60% range\nand so on.\nIf you have a parent with ADHD,\nthat number ranges anywhere\nfrom 10 to 25% likelihood,\nthat you will have ADHD\nif you have two parents\nand so on and so on, okay?\nSo there's a genetic component\nthat genetic component it turns out,\nrelates directly to how\nspecific neural circuits\nin the brain wire up,\nthe chemicals they use and the\nway they use those chemicals,\na topic that we are going\nto discuss in depth today.\nNow, if you have a close\nrelative with ADHD,\nthat does not mean that\nyou are faded to have ADHD\nand if you happen to have ADHD,\nthere are ways to overcome those symptoms\nof lack of attention,\nimpulsivity and so on.\nAnother important point about ADHD\nis that it has nothing\nto do with intelligence,\nwhether or not we're\ntalking about intelligence\nmeasured by a standard IQ test\na rather controversial issue\nas many of you probably know,\nthere are lots of forms of intelligence\nthat a standard IQ test\njust wouldn't pick up\nemotional intelligence,\nmusical intelligence,\nspatial intelligence, all\nsorts of intelligences.\nNone of them are related to ADHD.\nBeing very high functioning\ndoesn't make you\nmore likely to have ADHD and being ADHD\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nthat you have a low IQ.\nSo there are people with\nADHD who have low IQs\npeople with ADHD with high IQ,\npeople with ADHD with high\nemotional IQ or with low IQ\nin the emotional scale,\nit's all over the place.\nThe important point is that\nyour ability to attend and focus\ndoes not relate to how smart\nyou are or your IQ of any type,\nnot just a standard IQ.\nThe renaming of the ADD to ADHD took place\nin the mid to late 1980s\nwhen the psychiatric community\nand the psychological community\nstarted taking better\nnotice of the fact that\nso-called hyperactive kids\nalso had attentional issues.\nThis might seem obvious,\nbut there's been extensive\nand ongoing revision\nof the criteria for designating\na psychiatric disorder\nand this is still an\nongoing process even today.\nSo in the mid eighties,\nwe started hearing about ADHD\nand then gradually that term\nADD has been dropped away.\nHowever, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD\nhas led to much better\ndiagnosis and detection of ADHD.\nSo right now the current\nestimates are that\nabout one in 10 children\nand probably more have ADHD.\nThe current estimates are\nanywhere from 10%, one in 10\nto as high as 12%.\nNow, fortunately about half of those\nwill resolve with proper treatment,\nbut the other half typically don't.\nThe other thing that we\nare seeing a lot nowadays\nis increased levels of ADHD in adults\nand there's some question\nas to whether or not\nthose adults had ADHD that went undetected\nduring their childhood or whether or not\nADHD is now cropping up in adulthood\ndue to the way that we are\ninteracting with the world\nin particular smart phone use,\nthe combination of email,\ntext, real-world interactions,\nmultiple apps and streams\nof media and social media\nall coming in at once\ntrying to manage life.\nAll of the things that are going on\nare creating a kind of cloud\nof poles on our attention\nand so there is this\nquestion to whether or not\nwe are creating ADHD in\nadults that never had ADHD\nprior to being an adult.\nSo let's talk about attention\nand first let's just define\nwhat we mean by attention\nout there in the scientific literature\nand in discussions about ADHD,\nwe will hear things\nlike attention and focus\nand concentration and impulse control\nfor sake of today's discussion,\nattention, focus, and concentration\nare essentially the same thing, okay?\nWe could split hairs and\nthe scientific literature\ndoes split hairs about these.\nBut if we want to understand the biology\nand we want to have\na straightforward conversation about ADHD,\nif I say attention or focus,\nI'm basically referring to the same thing,\nunless I specify otherwise, okay?\nSo people with ADHD have\ntrouble holding their attention.\nWhat is attention?\nWell, attention is perception.\nIt's how we are perceiving\nthe sensory world.\nSo just a little bit of neurobiology 101,\nwe are sensing things all the time.\nThere's information coming\ninto our nervous system\nall the time.\nFor instance, right now\nyou're hearing sound waves.\nYou are seeing things,\nyou are sensing things against your skin,\nbut you're only paying\nattention to some of those\nand the ones that you're\npaying attention to\nare your perceptions.\nSo if you hear my voice,\nyou are perceiving my voice.\nYou are not paying attention\nto your other senses\nat the moment, okay?\nYou might even be outside in a breeze\nand until I said that,\nyou might not be perceiving that breeze,\nbut your body was sensing it all along.\nSo attention and focus are\nmore or less the same thing,\nbut impulse control is something\nseparate because impulse\ncontrol requires pushing out\nor putting the blinders on\nto sensory events in our environment.\nIt means lack of perception,\nimpulse control is about\nlimiting our perception.\nPeople with ADHD have poor attention\nand they have high levels of impulsivity\nthey're easily distractable.\nBut the way that shows\nup is very surprising.\nYou might think that people with ADHD\njust simply can't attend anything.\nThey really can't focus,\neven if they really want to,\nbut that's simply not the case.\nPeople with ADHD yes,\nthey are distractable.\nYes, they are impulsive.\nYes, they are easily annoyed\nby things happening in the room.\nThey sometimes have a high\nlevel of emotionality as well.\nNot always, but often\nhowever people with ADHD\ncan have a hyper focus\nand incredible ability to focus\non things that they really enjoy\nor and are intrigued by.\nNow, this is a very important point\nbecause typically we think\nof somebody with ADHD\nas being really wild and hyperactive,\nor having no ability whatsoever\nto sit still and attend\nand while that phenotype as we call it\nthat contour of behavior\nand cognition can exist,\nmany people, if not all people with ADHD,\nif you give them something\nthey really love,\nlike if the child loves video games\nor if a child loves to draw,\nor if an adult loves a\nparticular type of movie\nor a person very much, they\nwill obtain laser-focus\nwithout any effort.\nSo that tells us that people with ADHD\nhave the capacity to attend,\nbut they can't engage that attention\nfor things that they don't\nreally, really want to do\nand as we all know much of life,\nwhether or not you're a child or an adult\ninvolves doing a lot of things\nthat we don't want to do,\nmuch of our schooling\ninvolves doing things\nthat we would prefer not to do\nand sort of forcing ourselves\nto do it, to attend,\neven though we are not super interested\nin what we are attending to.\nThere are a couple other things\nthat people with ADHD display quite often.\nOne is challenges with time perception.\nNow time perception is\na fascinating aspect\nof how our brain works\nand later we're going to\ntalk about time perception\nand how you can actually get\nbetter at time perception.\nIt's very likely that right\nnow you are doing things\nthat get in the way of\noptimal time perception\nand I will tell you how\nto adjust your ability\nto measure time with your brain.\nPeople with ADHD often run late.\nThey often procrastinate,\nbut what's interesting and surprising\nis that if they are given a deadline,\nthey actually can perceive time very well\nand they often can focus very well\nif the consequences of\nnot completing a task\nor not attending are severe enough.\nIt's a little bit like the\nway that people with ADHD\ncan really focus if they like something.\nWell, if they're scared\nenough about the consequences\nof not attending, oftentimes not always,\nbut oftentimes they can attend.\nIf they're not really\nconcerned about a deadline\nor a consequence,\nwell, then they tend to lose track of time\nand they tend to underestimate\nhow long things will take.\nNow many people do that,\nnot just people with ADHD,\nbut people with ADHD have challenges,\nunderstanding how to line up\nthe activities of their day\nin order to meet particular deadlines\neven if it's just a simple thing,\nlike finishing one set\nof tasks before lunch,\noftentimes they will remember\nthat lunch starts at noon,\nbut somehow they aren't able\nto fill the intervening time\nin a way that's productive\nand they can obsess about\nthe upcoming deadline for instance,\nwe will talk about how to remedy this.\nIn addition,\ntheir spatial organization\nskills are often subpar,\nnot always, but often you will\nfind that somebody with ADHD\nuses what's called the pile system\nin order to organize things,\nthey will take many belongings\nand this could be in the\nkitchen or in their bedroom\nor in their office or in any space\nand they will start piling things up\naccording to a categorization system\nthat makes sense to them and only them.\nIt doesn't really have\nany logical framework.\nNow, many people use the pile system\nand if you use the pile system,\nthat doesn't mean that you have ADHD\nin fact, if you're unpacking a house\nor you've moved recently,\nor you've received a lot\nof presence recently,\nthe pile system makes perfect\nsense to organize your space.\nBut people with ADHD\ntend to organize things\naccording to the pile system all the time\nand that pile system\ndoesn't work for them.\nOkay, so that's the key distinction\nthat they use a filing system,\nand it's not really files,\nthey're piling things up in a\nway that makes sense to them,\nbut then it doesn't work for\nthem in terms of what tasks\nthey actually need to perform.\nThey can't find things\nor if anyone moves one thing\nthen it's very disruptive\nto their overall plan\nbecause their overall plan\ndoesn't really work in the first place.\nSo that's a common\nphenotype as we call it.\nA phenotype by the way,\nis just an expression of a\nparticular set of underlying\ngenetic or psychological components, okay?\nSo we say the phenotype.\nSo a phenotype can brown\nhair and green eyes,\nlike for me,\na phenotype could also be\nthat somebody uses the\npiling system, okay?\nThe other thing that people\nwith ADHD have real trouble with\nis so-called working memory.\nNow you might think that people with ADHD\nwould have really poor memories,\nbut in fact, that's not the case.\nPeople with ADHD often\ncan have a terrific memory\nfor past events,\nthey can remember upcoming\nevents quite well.\nTheir memory is clearly working.\nHowever, one aspect of\nmemory in particular\nthat we call working\nmemory is often disrupted.\nWorking memory is the ability to keep\nspecific information online,\nto recycle it in your\nbrain over and over again,\nso that you can use it in\nthe immediate or short term.\nA good example of this\nwould be you meet somebody,\nthey tell you their name,\nthey give you their phone number verbally,\nand you have to walk back to your phone\nand enter it into your phone.\nPeople without ADHD might have\nto put some effort into it,\nit might feel like a bit of a struggle,\nbut typically they will be able\nto recite that phone number\nin their mind over and over,\nand then put into their phone.\nPeople with ADHD,\ntend to lose the ability\nor lack the ability\nto remember things that they\njust need to keep online for\nanywhere from 10 seconds\nto a minute or two, okay?\nSo a string of numbers like 6,\n4, 3, 7, 8, 1 for most people\nwould be pretty easy.\n6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1,\nyou could probably remember\nthat a minute from now\nwithout writing it down.\nBut if you add one more number\nto that 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3,\nit gets tougher, okay?\nSo there's a reason why\nphone numbers typically have\nseven digits in them, of\ncourse, there's an area code,\nbut remembering information\nthat strings out longer\nthan seven numbers or a sentence or two\nthat's challenging for most people,\npeople with ADHD have severe challenges,\neven with much smaller\nbatches of information\nover even much smaller batches of time.\nDeficits in working memory are also\nsomething that we see in people who have\nfrontotemporal dementia,\nso damage to the frontal lobes\nor age-related cognitive decline\nand so it will come as\nno surprise that later\nwhen we discuss treatments, supplements,\nand other tools for ADHD,\nthat many of those treatments,\nsupplements and tools for\nADHD are similar to the ones\nthat work for age-related\ncognitive decline.\nOkay, so we've more or less established\nthe kind of menu of items that\npeople with ADHD tend to have\nsome have all of them.\nSome have just a subset of them.\nTheir severity can range\nfrom very intense to mild,\nbut in general,\nit's challenges with attention and focus,\nchallenges with impulse control,\nthey get annoyed easily.\nThey have kind of an impulsivity,\nthey can't stay on task.\nTime perception can be off,\nthey use the piling system\nor a system that doesn't\nwork well for them\nin order to organize their\nthings in physical space\nand they have a hard time\nwith anything that's mundane\nthat they're not really interested in.\nBut again, I just want to\nhighlight that people with ADHD\nare able to obtain\nheightened levels of focus,\neven hyper-focus for things\nthat are exciting to them\nand that they really want to engage in.\nSo now you have the\ncontour of what ADHD is,\nand if you're somebody\nwho doesn't have ADHD,\nyou should also be asking\nyourself which aspects of ADHD\nare similar to things\nI've experienced before.\nBecause what we know\nabout the healthy brain\nis that there's also a\nrange of abilities to focus.\nSome people focus very well on any task.\nYou give them a task, they can\njust laser in on that task.\nOther people that have to kind\nof fight an internal battle,\nthey have to convince themselves\nthat it's important or interesting.\nThey have to kind of incentivize\nthemselves internally.\nOther people doesn't matter,\nthey could be bored to\ntears with the information,\nbut they can do it just because they are,\n\"Very disciplined people.\"\nWe tend to admire those people\nbut as you'll see a little bit later,\nit's not clear that that's the best way\nto run your attentional system.\nThere might be something to this business\nof having heightened levels of attention\nfor the things that you are\nmost interested or excited by.\nSo let's drill into this\nissue of why people with ADHD\nactually can focus very intensely\non things that they enjoy\nand are curious about.\nNow, enjoyment and curiosity\nare psychological terms,\nthey're not even really\npsychological terms.\nThey're just the way that we\ndescribe our human experience\nof liking things, wanting\nto know more about them.\nBut from a neuro-biological perspective,\nthey have a very clear\nidentity and signature\nand that's dopamine.\nDopamine is released from neurons,\nit's what we call a neuromodulator\nand as a neuromodulator\nit changes the activity\nof the circuits in the brain,\nsuch that certain circuits\nare more active than others\nand in particular,\ndopamine creates a\nheightened state of focus.\nIt tends to contract our visual world\nand it tends to make us\npay attention to things\nthat are outside and beyond\nthe confines of our skin.\nThat's what we call exteroception.\nDopamine also tends to put\nus in a state of motivation\nand wanting things outside\nthe confines of our skin.\nSo whether or not we're pursuing something\nphysical in our world,\nor whether or not we're\npursuing information\nin our outside world,\ndopamine is largely\nresponsible for our ability\nand our drive to do that.\nBut dopamine as a\nneuromodulator is also involved\nin changing the way that\nwe perceive the world.\nSo, as I mentioned earlier\nyou have all these senses coming in\nand you can only perceive some of them\nbecause you're only paying\nattention to some of them.\nDopamine when it's released in our brain\ntends to turn on areas of our brain\nthat narrow our visual focus\nand our auditory focus,\nso it creates a cone\nof auditory attention,\nthat's very narrow,\ncreates a tunnel of visual\nattention that's very narrow.\nWhereas when we have less dopamine,\nwe tend to view the entire world,\nwe tend to see the whole\nscene that we are in,\nwe tend to hear everything all at once.\nSo as I describe this,\nhopefully you're already\nstarting to see and understand\nhow having dopamine\nrelease can allow a person,\nwhether or not they have ADHD or not\nto direct their attention\nto particular things\nin their environment, all right?\nSo now what we're doing is\nwe're moving away from attention\nas this kind of vague ambiguous term,\nand we're giving it a\nneurochemical identity dopamine,\nand we are giving it a\nneural circuit identity\nand just to put a little\nbit of flavor and detail\non which neurocircuits those are,\nI want to discuss two general\ntypes of neurocircuits\nthat dopamine tends to enhance.\nSo let's talk neurocircuits\nand for those of you that\nlove hearing neuroscience,\nnomenclature, you're\ngoing to eat this part up\nand for those of you that\ndon't like a lot of names\nof brain areas I invite you to tune out\nor just try and grab\nthe top contour of this.\nI will describe it in\npretty general terms,\nbut I will give some detail\nbecause I know there are\nsome of you out there who\nreally want to dig deeper into\nwhat the exact structures\nand connectivities are, okay?\nSo there are two main\ntypes of circuits that\nwe need to think about\nwith respect to ADHD,\nattention and dopamine.\nThe first one is called\nthe default mode network.\nThe default mode network is\nthe network of brain areas\nin your brain and my brain\nand in everybody's brain\nthat is active when\nwe're not doing anything\nwhen we're just sitting\nthere idle at rest.\nNow it's very hard to\nnot think about anything,\nbut when you're not engaged\nin any type of specific task,\nso you're not driving, you're\nnot playing a video game,\nyou're not trying to study,\nyou're not trying to listen,\nyou're just sitting\nthere letting your brain\nkind of go wherever it wants to go.\nYour default mode network\nunderlies that state of mind.\nThe other set of circuits that\nwe're going to think about\nand talk about with respect\nto ADHD are the task networks,\nthe networks of the brain\nthat make you goal oriented,\nor that are at least trying\nto make you goal oriented\nand those are a completely\ndifferent set of brain areas.\nHowever, the default mode network\nand these tasks networks are\ncommunicating with one another\nand they're doing that\nin very interesting ways.\nSo first I want to describe how these two\nsets of brain areas,\nthe default mode network\nand the task networks\nnormally interact, okay?\nSo little bit of naming here\nagain feel free to ignore it\nif you don't want this level of detail,\nbut the default mode network includes\nan area called the\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex,\nfrontal cortex, no surprises in the front\nand you have a dorsal, the top\nand side lateral part\ndorsolateral, prefrontal cortex.\nYou got one on each side\nof your brain, right?\nAnd then you have a brain area called\nthe posterior cingulate cortex\nand then you have an area called\nthe lateral parietal lobe.\nAgain, you don't need to\nremember these names for,\nthese are three brain areas that normally\nare synchronized in their activity.\nSo when one of these areas is\nactive in a typical person,\nthe other areas would be active as well.\nSo it's a little bit\nlike a symphony or a band\nlike a three-piece band\nis like drums, guitar,\nand bass they're playing together, okay?\nThat's how it is in a typical person\nand in a person with ADHD,\nor even a person who has subclinical ADHD\nor in any human being\nwho hasn't slept well,\nwhat you find is the default mode network\nis not synchronized.\nThese brain areas are just\nnot playing well together.\nNow the task networks include\na different set of structures.\nIt still involves the prefrontal cortex,\nbut it's a different part of\nthe prefrontal cortex, okay?\nTends to be the medial prefrontal cortex\nand there are some other brain areas\nthat the medial prefrontal\ncortex is communicating to\nall the time, mainly to suppress impulses.\nIt's shutting down the desire to stand up\nor to scratch the side of\nyour cheek or your nose,\nif you're trying not to do that,\nanytime you're restricting your behavior,\nThese task directed networks\nare very active, okay?\nNow normally in a person without ADHD,\nthe task networks and\nthe default mode networks\nare going in kind of Seesaw fashion,\nthey are actually what\nwe call anti-correlated.\nSo it's not just that\nthey are not correlated,\nthey're actually opposing one another\nthey are anti-correlated.\nIn a person with ADHD,\nthe default mode networks\nand the tasks networks\nare actually more coordinated.\nThat might come a surprising,\nI think that we all have this tendency\nto kind of jump to conclusion\nand assume that somebody\nwho doesn't have an easy time\npaying attention or has ADHD,\nthat their brain must\nbe completely incoherent\nthat it's not working well\nand because everything's out of whack,\nbut there's something interesting\nabout people with ADHD\nwhereby the task networks\nand the default mode networks\nare actually working together\nin a way that's correlated\nand that is what's abnormal.\nSo this would be like the\nguitar bass and the drums\nplaying together in a way where\nthe bass isn't keeping the\nbackbeat and the drums,\naren't keeping the backbeat\nthat they're playing together,\nthey're all playing the\nmelodies and harmonies\nin a way that just doesn't sound right.\nThat's what's going on in the\nbrain of somebody with ADHD\nand we can now confidently say\nbased on brain imaging studies,\nthat when somebody gets better,\nwhen they're treated for ADHD\nor when they age out of ADHD,\nas sometimes it's the case\nthat the default mode networks\nand the task networks tend to become\nanti-correlated again, okay?\nSo that's the underlying neurobiology,\nbut you'll notice that I\ndidn't mention dopamine at all.\nWhat dopamine is doing in this context\nis dopamine is acting like a conductor.\nDopamine is saying this\ncircuit should be active\nthen that circuit should be active.\nIt should be default mode network\nand then when the default\nmode network is not active,\nthen it should be the task network.\nSo it's really acting as a\nconductor saying, you go,\nnow you go, now you go, now you go.\nAnd in ADHD,\nthere's something about\nthe dopamine system\nthat is not allowing it\nto conduct these networks\nand make sure that they stay what,\nthe engineers or physicists\nor mathematicians would say\nout of phase to be anti-correlated, okay?\nOut of phase and anti correlate,\nessentially the same thing,\nat least for purposes of this discussion.\nSo that raises two questions,\ncould it be that dopamine is\nnot at sufficiently high levels\nor could it be that dopamine\nis just doing it all wrong?\nIn other words,\nis there no conductor or is\nthe conductor playing with like\nlittle tiny toothpicks\nand so the instruments can't see\nwhat they're supposed to do.\nThey can't get the instruction\n'cause it's just not\nloud enough, so to speak,\nor could it be that the\ninformation is getting out,\nbut the information that's\ngetting out is wrong,\nthe conductor's there,\nbut the conductor is in\nvery good at conducting.\nNow we can gain insight\ninto how the system works\nand fails and how to treat it\nby looking at some of the current\nand previous treatments for ADHD,\nas well as some of the recreational drugs\nthat people with ADHD\ntend to pursue and like\nnow I'm certainly not a\nproponent of people with ADHD\ntaking drugs recreationally,\nthat's not what this is about,\nbut if you look at their\ndrug seeking behavior\nand you couple that drug seeking behavior\nto their desire to remedy\ntheir attention deficit,\nyou start gaining some\nreally interesting insight\ninto how dopamine is\nregulating these circuits\nin normal circumstances\nand in people with ADHD.\nSo what exactly is going on\nwith the dopamine system,\nin people with ADHD\nand what's going on\nwith the dopamine system\nin people that have\nterrific levels of attention\nfor any task?\nWell, in the year 2015, an\nimportant paper came out.\nThe first author is Spencer,\nand it came out in a journal\ncalled Biological Psychiatry,\nand it formalized the so-called\nlow dopamine hypothesis of ADHD.\nThe idea that dopamine\nwas somehow involved\nor not at the appropriate\nlevels in people with ADHD\nhad been around for a pretty long time,\nbut a formal proposition of\nthe low dopamine hypothesis\nled to some really important\nexperiments and understanding\nof what goes wrong in ADHD.\nIt turns out that if\ndopamine levels are too low\nin particular circuits in the brain,\nthat it leads to unnecessary\nfiring of neurons in the brain\nthat are unrelated to the\ntask that one is trying to do\nand that is unrelated to the information\nthat one is trying to focus on.\nSo if you think back\nbefore you've got this\ndefault mode network and\na task-related network,\nand they need to be in\nthis kind of concert of\nanti-correlation and an ADHD\nthey're firing together.\nWell, the problem seems to\nbe that when dopamine is low,\ncertain neurons are firing\nwhen they shouldn't be,\nthis is like a band, right?\nWe'll go back to our band,\nthat's a guitar bass in it,\nand the person playing the drums\nand it's as if one of those or\nseveral of those instruments\nare playing notes when they\nshouldn't be playing, right?\nThe pauses and music are just as important\nas the actual playing of notes.\nWhen dopamine is too low neurons fire,\nmore than they should in these networks\nthat govern attention.\nThis is the so-called\nlow dopamine hypothesis\nand if you start looking anecdotally\nat what people with ADHD\nhave done for decades,\nnot just recently since\nthe low dopamine hypothesis\nhas been proposed,\nbut what they were doing in\nthe 1950s and then the 1940s\nand the 1960s.\nWhat you find is that they\ntend to use recreational drugs,\nor they tend to indulge\nin non drug stimulants.\nSo things like drinking,\nsix cups of coffee\nor quadruple espressos,\nor when it was more prominent\nsmoking a half a pack of cigarettes\nand drinking four cups of coffee a day\nor if the person had access to it\nusing cocaine as a recreational drug\nor amphetamine as a recreational drug.\nAll of those substances\nthat I just described\nin particular cocaine and amphetamine,\nbut also coffee and cigarettes\nincrease levels of\nmultiple neurotransmitters,\nbut all have the quality\nof increasing levels\nof dopamine in the\nbrain and in particular,\nin the regions of the brain\nthat regulate attention\nand these task related and\ndefault mode networks okay?\nNow young children,\nfortunately don't have access\nto those kinds of stimulants\nmost of the time\nand those stimulants\nall have high potential\nfor abuse in adults.\nSo we will talk about\nthe potential for abuse\nin a few minutes.\nBut if you look at children,\neven very young children with ADHD,\nthey show things like\npreference for sugary foods,\nwhich also act as dopamine\ninducing stimulants.\nNow, of course, once they\nget access to soda pop\nand coffee and tea,\nthey start to indulge in\nthose more than other people.\nFor a long time,\nit was thought that children with ADHD\nconsumed too many sugary\nfoods or drank too much soda\nor adults with ADHD\nwould take recreational\ndrugs like methamphetamine\nor cocaine or would drink coffee to excess\nor smoke cigarettes to excess\nbecause they had poor levels of attention\nand because they couldn't\nmake good decisions,\nthey were too impulsive and so forth\nand while that certainly\ncould be the case,\nknowing what we now know about dopamine,\nand the fact that having\nenough dopamine is required\nin order to coordinate\nthese neural circuits\nthat allow for focus and\nquality decision-making\nan equally valid idea\nis that these children\nand these adults are actually\ntrying to self-medicate\nby pursuing these compounds, right?\nThings like cocaine lead to\nhuge increases in dopamine.\nWell, what happens was\nwhen somebody with ADHD\ntakes that drug,\nit turns out they actually obtain\nheightened levels of focus,\ntheir ability to focus on things\nother than things they absolutely care\nintensely about goes up,\nlikewise, children who consume anything\nthat increases their levels of dopamine,\nif those children have ADHD,\nthey tend to be calmer,\nthey tend to be able to focus more.\nNow, this is very different than children\nwho do not have ADHD.\nWhen they consume too much sugar,\nthey tend to become super hyperactive.\nWhen they consume any kind of stimulant,\nthey tend to go wild and\nrun around like crazy.\nActually, I have an anecdote about this\njust to illustrate it.\nI have a friend,\nhe has two children that\nare now in their teens\nand twenties, but when they were little,\none time, I brought them some\nchocolate just as a gift,\nwhen I showed up at their\nhouse and within 30 minutes,\nthe kids were running around like crazy\nI mean they were pretty high energy kids,\nbut they were going bonkers\nand that's actually when the\nmother, my friend at the time,\nunfortunately, still now\nlooked at the chocolate,\nrealized that it was chocolate\nwith espresso beans in it.\nIt was like dark chocolate\nwith espresso beans\nso I was really at fault there,\nyou don't want to give kids dark chocolate\nwith espresso beans,\nbut what you're really\nseeing that hyperactivity\nthat is dopamine, okay?\nIt's the sugar combined with\nthe caffeine in this case,\ncombined with a few other\ncompounds that exist in chocolate,\nthat really increase\nour levels of alertness\nand our tendency to want\nto move around a lot, okay?\nSo dopamine and low levels of dopamine\napparently are what's\nwrong in people with ADHD,\nthat dopamine hypothesis\nis what led to the idea\nthat treating people,\nchildren and adults included\nwith dopaminergic compounds\nwould somehow increase\ntheir ability to focus\nand if you look at the major\ndrugs that were developed\nand now marketed by\npharmaceutical companies\nfor the treatment of ADHD,\nthose drugs have names like Ritalin.\nNowadays, it's typically\nthings like Adderall, Modafinil\nand some of the other derivatives,\nthey all serve to increase\nlevels of dopamine\nin particular dopamine in the networks\nthat control task directed behavior,\nand that coordinate the\ndefault mode network\nand these task-related networks.\nSo many of you have\nprobably heard of Ritalin.\nRitalin is a prescription\nstimulant that is\nprescribed for ADHD as\nwell as for narcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy is a condition\nin which people tend to fall asleep\nduring the day time, quite a lot,\nexcessive daytime sleepiness,\nnot due to lack of sleep at night,\nbut also tend to fall asleep\nwhen they get excited,\nif they're really emotionally\nexcited or about to eat\nor any other kind of activity that\nwould normally get somebody\nreally aroused and alert\npeople with narcolepsy\ntend to fall asleep,\nor they tend to become\nwhat's called cataplectic.\nThey tend to just sort of\ngo limp in the muscles.\nSo it's this invasion of\nsleep into the daytime.\nIt's dysregulated by emotion.\nYou can imagine why a stimulant,\nsomething that would wake\nyou up, make you very alert,\nfocused and motivated\nwould be a good treatment for narcolepsy.\nAdderall also is used to treat\nADHD and to treat narcolepsy\nthings like Modafinil\nalso used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.\nSo you're sensing a theme here.\nSo what are the differences\nand similarities\nbetween these drugs\nand what can that tell us about ADHD?\nWell, Ritalin was one of\nthe first-generation drugs\nthat was prescribed for ADHD\nin order to deal head on\nwith this dopamine hypothesis.\nThis idea that in ADHD,\ndopamine levels are too low.\nNowadays, Adderall is the\nmore typically prescribed drug\nfor ADHD that has to do\nwith some of the so-called\npharmacokinetics,\nthe rate at which those\ndrugs enter the system\nand how long they last in the system.\nSo for instance,\nRitalin was a drug that was packaged\ninto various time-release formulas.\nWhereas initially Adderall was\nonly released in a form that\nhad a very short life,\nSo meaning that it wasn't\nin the bloodstream very long\nand didn't affect the brain for very long\nand so the dosages could be\ncontrolled in a more typical way\nwithout going into a lot\nof tangential detail.\nAs you all know, at\ndifferent times of day,\nyou tend to be more or less alert.\nSo a long sustained release drug\nwhile that might sound like\na really terrific thing.\nIf that drug is having an effect\nof making you more alert\nand it's released across\nvery many hours of your day,\nthere might be periods of your day\nwhen you feel too alert,\nperiods of your day,\nwhen you feel just right\nand periods of your day,\nwhen you wished that you were more alert.\nThese are some of the\npharmacokinetics, kinetics,\nmeaning movement of\nthe different compounds\nwithin the bloodstream\nand brain that could,\nyou could imagine in a very real way,\nwould impact whether or not\nsomeone would feel really good\non one of these drugs or whether or not\nthey would feel too anxious\nor too sleepy and so on.\nLet's take a step back\nfor a second and just ask,\nwhat are these drugs?\nWe know they increase dopamine,\nbut what are they really?\nWell, Ritalin also called methylphenidate\nis very similar to amphetamine speed,\nor what's typically call speed\nin the street drug nomenclature.\nAdderall, which goes by\nvarious other names, okay?\nSo Adderall, Adderall XR, my\ndialysis, things like that.\nAdderall is basically a combination of\namphetamine and dextroamphetamine.\nNow some of you probably realize this,\nthat Adderall is amphetamine,\nbut I'm guessing that there a\ngood number of you out there,\nperhaps even parents and\nkids that don't realize that\nthese drugs like cocaine and\namphetamine methamphetamine,\nwhich are incredibly dangerous\nand incredibly habit forming\nand have high potential for abuse.\nWell, the pharmaceutical versions of those\nare exactly what are used to treat ADHD\nand they're not exactly like\ncocaine or methamphetamine,\nbut they are structurally\nand chemically very similar\nand their net effect in the brain and body\nis essentially the same,\nwhich is to increase dopamine primarily,\nbut also to increase\nlevels of a neuromodulator\ncalled epinephrin or norepinephrine\nalso called noradrenaline and adrenaline\nthose names are the\nsame and to some extent\nto increase levels of serotonin\nin the brain and blood,\nbut not so much serotonin,\nthat's just kind of a small\nsmidgen of effect, okay?\nSo dopamine way up norepinephrine\nand adrenaline way up.\nSo that's motivation\ndrive, focus and energy\nand to some extent, a\nlittle bit of serotonin,\nwhich is really more about\nfeeling calm and relaxed\nand you can imagine why that would be\na good balancing effect for\ndopamine and norepinephrine.\nSo what I'm essentially\nsaying is that the drugs\nthat are used to treat\nADHD are stimulants,\nand they look very much alike.\nIn fact, nearly identical to\nsome of the so-called street drugs,\nstimulants that we all\nhere are so terrible.\nHowever, I do want to emphasize\nthat at the appropriate dosages\nand working with a quality psychiatrist\nor neurologist or family physician\ndoes have to be a board certified MD\nthat prescribes these things,\nmany people with ADHD\nachieve excellent relief\nwith these drugs, not all of\nthem, but many of them do,\nespecially if these treatments\nare started early in life.\nSo now knowing what these drugs are,\nI want to raise the question\nof why prescribe these drugs?\nI mean, everyone has to make\na decision for themselves\nor for their child as to whether or not\nthey're going to take these things or not.\nI also want to acknowledge\nthat many people out there,\nmany, many people out there\nare taking these drugs,\neven though they have not\nbeen clinically diagnosed\nwith ADHD when I say these drugs,\nI'm specifically referring\nto Ritalin and Adderall\nand Modafinil, but more\ntypically it's Adderall, okay?\nPeople using cocaine and amphetamine\nfor recreational purposes,\nthat's a completely different beast\nand it is indeed a beast\nand it's something that\nI strongly discourage.\nHowever, I'm aware that up\nto 25% of college students,\nand perhaps as many as\n35% of all individuals\nbetween the ages of 17\nand 30 are taking Adderall\non a regular or semi-regular basis\nin order to work, in order to study\nand in order to function and\nfocus in their daily life.\nEven though they have not\nbeen diagnosed with ADHD,\nthere's a whole black market for this.\nThey're getting it from\npeople with prescriptions.\nI'm not here to pass judgment.\nI just want to emphasize\nhow these drugs work.\nSome of the things that\nthey do to enhance cognition\nand focus that actually\nserve the brain well\nin certain individuals and how\nthey can be very detrimental\nin other individuals.\nI sort of blew right past it.\nBut the fact that in upwards\nof 25% of young people\nare taking things like Adderall,\ndespite not having a\nclinical diagnosis of ADHD.\nWell, that's a ridiculously high number.\nA few years ago,\nit was estimated that\nAdderall use and Ritalin use\nwithout diagnosis of ADHD\nwas second in incident\nonly to cannabis,\nbut actually now the\nconsumption of Adderall\nwithout prescription is higher than\nthe consumption of\ncannabis in that age group.\nSo what that means is that\nthere's a lot of stimulant use\nin that age group\nand there are a lot of adults also\nusing and abusing stimulants\nin order to gain focus.\nThen we can have a whole\ndiscussion about whether or not\nlife is becoming more demanding,\nwhether or not the need\nfor focus is excessive\nand that's why people are doing that.\nBut frankly, it's an\ninteresting discussion,\nbut it's not one that would\ndeliver us to any answers.\nRather, I'd like to focus\non the ways that people now\nand people have always\nbeen self-medicating\nto increase, focus, right?\nCaffeine, which I can indulge\nsome, I don't think to\naccess has long been used\nas a stimulant to increase dopamine,\nincrease norepinephrine,\nincreased focus and energy\nand in addition to that,\nit works through the so-called cyclic amp,\nphosphodiesterase pathway,\nremember anytime you see,\nyou hear an ASE, that's an enzyme.\nPhosphodiesterase is involved in the\nconversion of things like cyclic amp into\nenergy for cells and so forth.\nBasically coffee gives you\nenergy it makes you feel good\nand it increases focus\nbecause of the circuits\nthat it engages in the brain.\nPeople have been taking caffeine\nand continue to take it caffeine for ages.\nPeople also used to smoke cigarettes,\nnicotine in order to gain focus.\nNowadays, that's less common\nbecause of the concerns,\nquite valid concerns about\nlung cancer from smoking,\nbut there's a lot of vaping out there.\nThere are a lot of people\nnow consuming nicotine,\nwhich is the active\nsubstance in cigarettes\nand in most nicotine vapes\nthat stimulates the brain\nto be more focused and more alert.\nSo the idea of taking\nstimulants of consuming things\nor smoking things in order\nto increase alertness\nis not a new idea.\nIt's just that in ADHD,\nit's surprising that these\nthings would work, right?\nI mean, if the problem is\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,\nwhat we're really talking about here,\nor children that are prescribed a drug\nthat ought to be a stimulant,\nit ought to make them hyper hyperactive\nand rather than doing that,\nit actually somehow\nserves to calm them a bit,\nor at least allow them to focus.\nHere's the reason, children have a brain\nthat's a very plastic\nmeaning it can remodel itself\nand change in response to\nexperience very, very quickly\ncompared to adults.\nTaking stimulants as a child,\nif you are a child diagnosed with ADHD\nallows that forebrain task\nrelated network to come online,\nto be active at the appropriate times\nand because those children are young,\nit allows those children\nto learn what focus is\nand to sort of follow or\nenter that tunnel of focus.\nNow, by taking a drug, it's\ncreating focus artificially,\nit's not creating focus because\nthey're super interested\nin something it's chemically\ninducing, a state of focus,\nand let's face it a lot\nof childhood and school\nand becoming a functional adult\nis about learning how to focus\neven though you don't\nwant to do something.\nIn fact, when I was in college,\nI had this little trick\nthat may or may not work\nfor some of you,\nwhich is if I couldn't\nfocus on the material\nI was trying to learn,\nI would delude myself into thinking\nthat it was the most\ninteresting thing in the world.\nI would just kind of lie\nto myself and tell myself,\nokay, this, I won't mention the subjects,\nI absolutely love this.\nI would just, I would tell\nmyself that I loved it\nand I noticed that just that selective\nor deliberate engagement of\nthat desire to know circuit,\nwhatever that is in my brain,\nno doubt involves dopamine,\nallowed me to focus and\nremember the information\nand somewhat surprisingly\nor perhaps not surprisingly,\nI would often fall in\nlove with the information.\nI find that that was my favorite class.\nSo it was what I wanted to learn the most.\nSo that's one way you\ncan do it artificially,\nbut kids with ADHD, they\ncan't do that, right?\nThey're told to sit still\nand they end up getting up 11 times.\nThey are told that they\ncan't speak out in class\nor that they have to remain\nin their seats for 10 minutes\nand they just, despite their best effort,\nthey simply cannot do it,\nthey're highly distractable.\nSo what are we to make\nof this whole picture\nthat we need more dopamine,\nbut these kids with ADHD,\nthey're getting their\ndopamine by way of a drug,\nwhich is for all the\nworld amphetamines, right?\nIt's speed, that's really what it is.\nWhat are the long-term consequences,\nwhere the short-term consequences\nand what should we make of\npeople taking these drugs\nwithout a clinical need?\nWhat are the consequences there?\nWell, in order to get to\nsome of those answers,\nI went to one of my colleagues,\nthis is a colleague\nthat I've actually known\nfor a very long time, I was\ntheir teaching assistant\nwhen they were an undergraduate,\nthey went on to get an\nMD, a medical degree,\nas well as a PhD and become\na pediatric neurologist\nthat specializes in the\ntreatment of epilepsy\nand ADHD in kids of all\nages, from age three to 21,\nthat's the age range,\npretty broad age range and has\nextensive knowledge in this\nand what makes them particularly\ninteresting for sake of\nthis discussion is that they\nhave a child, a young boy,\nwho's now showing signs of ADHD\nand they are on the\nthreshold of trying to decide\nwhether or not they\nwill prescribe Adderall\nor something similar.\nSo we had a discussion about this\nand prior to learning that\ntheir child may have ADHD.\nI asked the following questions.\nFirst of all, I asked,\nwhat do you think about\ngiving young kids amphetamine?\nAnd their answer was, on the\nface of it, it seems crazy,\nbut provided that the\nlowest possible dose is used\nand that that dosage is\nmodulating as they grow older\nand develop those powers of attention,\ntheir observation was that\nthey've seen more kids benefit\nthan not benefit from that.\nNow I'm certainly not saying\nwhat people should do.\nYou obviously have to go to a doctor\nbecause as I always say, I'm not a doctor,\nI don't prescribe anything,\nI'm a professor so I profess things\nand here I'm professing that\nyou talk to your doctor,\nif you're considering\ngiving Ritalin or Adderall\nor any type of stimulant\nto your child, of course,\nwhat could be more important\nthan the health of your child.\nBut it was a very\ninteresting answer because\ntypically we hear yes,\nmedicator don't medicate.\nRarely do we hear that the\nmedication should be adjusted\nacross the lifespan and in\nany particular kind of way.\nNow the fact that this person,\nthis now friend of mine\nand colleague of mine\nhas so much expertise in\nthe way that the brain works\nand is considering putting\ntheir child on such medication.\nI said, why wouldn't you wait\nuntil your kid reaches puberty?\nI mean, we know that in boys and in girls,\nthere are increases in testosterone\nand estrogen during puberty,\nthat dramatically change the\nway that the body appears.\nBut also that dramatically change\nthe way that the brain functions\nin particular we know this,\nthat puberty triggers the\nactivation of so-called\nfrontotemporal task related\nexecutive functioning.\nThat's just fancy science\nspeak for being able to focus,\nbeing able to direct your attention,\nbeing able to control your\nimpulses, look at a small child,\nor look at a puppy and then\nlook at an older child,\nor look at a dog, very different levels,\npatterns of spontaneous behavior.\nYoung children move around a lot they're,\nI don't want to say shifty,\ncause that makes it sound like\nthey're up to something bad,\nwhich they might be,\nbut they don't have to\nbe up to something bad,\nthey fidget a lot.\nSo to puppies,\neverything's a stimulus as\nanimals and humans get older,\nthey learn how to control\ntheir behavior and sit, still,\nlisten and focus even\nif they don't want to.\nSo giving a drug that allows\na child to access that\nstillness early on it's\nthought will allow them\nto maintain that ability as time goes on.\nBut I decided to push\na little bit further,\nI said, well, why would you do it now\nas opposed to during\npuberty or after puberty?\nAnd their answer was very specific\nand I think very important,\nwhat they said was look,\nneuroplasticity is greatest in childhood\nand tapers off after about age 25,\nbut neuroplasticity from\nage three until age 12 or 13\nis exceedingly high and they're right,\nwhen you sit back\nand you look at the\nliterature on neuroplasticity,\nyou'd say childhood plasticity\nand young adult plasticity\nis much greater than adult plasticity,\nbut that early childhood\nplasticity is far and away\nthe period in which you\ncan reshape the brain\nat an accelerated rate.\nSo this lines up really well\nwith the clinical literature.\nNot surprisingly,\nthere are clinician that\nearly treatment is key.\nIf you have the opportunity to\nwork with a quality physician\nand treat these things early,\nthese drugs can allow\nthese frontal circuits,\nthese task-related circuits\nto achieve their appropriate\nlevels of functioning and for\nkids to learn how to focus\nin a variety of different contexts.\nNow, is that the only thing\nthat they should be doing?\nOf course not.\nSo the next question I asked was\nwhat should we make of all\nthis diet related stuff, right?\nI've heard before that the\nso-called elimination diet\nor ingesting no sugars\nor no dairy or no gluten,\nthat all of these things\nhave been purported\nto improve symptoms of ADHD and\npeople and parents with ADHD\ngo to fanatic lanes to try\nand find the exact foods\nthat are causing problems\nand the exact foods\nthat the kids can eat in order to try\nand get their brain wired up right,\nand correctly, and to avoid lifelong ADHD\nand their answer was really interesting.\nBut before I tell you their answer,\nI want to tell you the\nstudies and the data\nrelated to this question\nof whether or not food\nand the constellation\nof foods that one avoids\nand will eat has anything to\ndo with our levels of attention\nand in particular,\nwhether or not that can be\nused as a leverage point\nto treat ADHD.\nSo you can imagine the\nchallenges of exploring the role\nof diet and nutrition in any study,\nbut especially in a study on ADHD, why?\nWell, because as I mentioned\nbefore, children with ADHD,\nand it turns out adults with ADHD\ntend to pursue sugary\nfoods or any types of food\nthat increase their levels of dopamine.\nThey are naturally drawn to those foods,\nwhether or not they realize it or not,\npresumably as a way to try and treat\ntheir lack of focus and impulsivity.\nSo in this study that I'm\nabout to share with you,\nthere was no drug treatment,\nit was just a study,\nmanipulating diet and\ninvolved 100 children,\n50 in the so-called\nelimination diet group,\nthe special diet where\ncertain foods were eliminated\nand 50 in the so-called control group.\nHowever, being a well-designed\nrandomized controlled trial,\nthis study also included a crossover,\nmeaning where the kids would\nserve as their own control\nor control group at a\ncertain portion of the study.\nSo there'll be in one group\nwhere they eliminated certain foods\nand then after a period\nof time in the study,\nthey would swap to the other group.\nThis is a powerful way to design a study\nfor reasons that you can imagine,\nbecause you start to\neliminate changes and effects\ndue to individual differences.\nIn any case, 100 children\ntotal 50 in each group\nat any one period in time\nand the effects that they\nobserved were extremely dramatic.\nIn the world of statistics and\nanalysis of scientific data,\nwe talk about P-values,\nprobability values.\nWhat's the likelihood that something\ncould happen according to chance\nand typically the cutoff would be\nsomething like P less than 0.05,\nthat's less than 0.05 chance essentially,\nof the effect being due to chance.\nHowever, in this study,\nevery single one of the\neffects is P less than 0.0001,\nvery, very infant decimally small\nprobability that the effect\nobserved could be due to chance.\nSo what were these effects?\nThese effects were\nenhanced ability to focus,\nless impulsivity,\neven less tendency to move\nwhen trying to sit still.\nSo everything from mental focus\nto the ability to control\ntheir bodies improved\nwhen they were in the\nelimination diet group,\nwhat was eliminated?\nWell, the elimination diet\nin this particular study\nwas a so-called oligoantigenic diet.\nIt was a diet in which each\nkid took a test to determine\nwhich foods they had antibodies for,\nmeaning that they were mildly allergic to.\nNow in this study, it was very important\nthat the kids not be\nextremely allergic to any food\nbecause as I mentioned before,\nthey actually served as a\ncontrol at one point in the study\nwhere they were eating all sorts of foods,\nincluding foods that\nhad mild allergies to.\nSo basically what the study\nsaid was that eliminating foods\nto which children have allergies\ncan dramatically improve\ntheir symptoms of ADHD.\nAnd this study,\nnot surprisingly because it was published\nin such a high quality\njournal Lancet, et cetera,\nlarge number of subjects\nset the world on fire.\nPeople were extremely\nexcited about these results\nbecause here in the absence\nof any drug treatment,\nthere was a significant improvement\nin ADHD symptoms observed\nand then came the criticisms.\nSo many papers were published\nafter this specifically\ndealing with re-analysis of these data\nand I want to be fair in saying that\nthe data in the paper look good,\nbut there are criticisms\nof the overall structural\ndesign of the study.\nI don't want to go into\nall the details exactly\n'cause it gets really nuanced\nabout some of the statistics\nand the way that one\nexamines these types of data,\nbut there was skepticism\nand in science, skepticism is healthy,\nespecially when making decisions about\nwhether or not to treat or feed children\none food or another, or give\nthem one drug or another.\nNow I want to return to\nthe story of my friend,\nwho is a pediatric\nneurologist and treats ADHD\nand has a child who is on the precipice of\nperhaps starting to take drugs\nfor the treatment of ADHD.\nI asked the simple question,\ndo you see an effect of diet?\nMeaning when parents control\nthe diet of their children,\ndoes it make a positive or\nnegative or no difference in\nterms of the way that\nthe kids respond to ADHD,\ndrugs like Ritalin and\nAdderall or whether or not\nit can help them avoid treating\nwith those drugs entirely?\nAnd her response was very\nstraightforward, she said,\nelimination of simple sugars\nhas a dramatic and positive effect.\nShe's observed that over\nand over and over again\nin many dozens, if not\nhundreds of patients, okay?\nNow that's not a peer reviewed study,\nthat's a statement that I'm\nconveying to you anecdotally,\nbut it's a highly, highly informed one.\nI said, what about\nthese elimination diets?\nShe said, and I found other\nsources to support this,\nthat these oligoantigenic\ndiets are controversial.\nThere are many people who really believe\nin identifying all the things\nthat you're allergic to\nand making sure that you\nand especially your\nkids avoid those foods.\nHowever, there's another camp\nthat's starting to emerge\nin the peer reviewed\nscientific literature,\nshowing that when kids are\nnot exposed to certain foods\nin particular nuts and\nthings of that sort,\nthey develop allergies to those foods\nand then when exposed to them later,\nthey cause real problems.\nSo there's a whole galaxy of\ndiscussion and controversy\nand outright fighting about allergies\nand kids and whether or\nnot the oligoantigenic diet\nis the appropriate one.\nHowever, out of the four\nneurologists and psychiatrists\nthat I spoke to about ADHD\nin preparation for this,\nevery single one said children with ADHD,\nas much as possible,\nshould be encouraged to avoid high sugar\nand simple sugar foods of most kinds\nand if they can find particular foods\nthat exacerbate their symptoms,\nobviously eliminating\nthose foods is beneficial\nand the foods that\nexacerbate their symptoms\nchange over time.\nSo I don't like giving\na complicated answer,\nbut I also don't like\ngiving an incomplete answer.\nWhat this tells me is that children,\nespecially young children who have ADHD\nshould probably not eat much sugar\nin particular simple sugars.\nIn addition to that,\nexploring whether or not\nthey have existing allergies\nto foods, they already\nconsume might be a good idea.\nAt least that's what this paper,\nthe Pelsser et. al Lancet\npaper seems to speak to\nand I should mention that that\npaper was published in 2011.\nSince then there have been many\ndozens of studies exploring\nthe same thing, as well as\nmeta analysis of all those data\nand it does appear that diet can have\na highly significant role in eliminating\nor at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD\nso much so that some of the children\nare able to not take medication at all,\nor eventually wean\nthemselves off medication\nas young adults and as adults.\nOne interesting question\nis whether or not adults\nshould modify their diet in order to\nincrease their levels of focus,\nif they're already having\nnormal levels of focus,\nbut we'd like more or would like to reduce\nexisting adult ADHD,\nthat's an interesting,\nand even more controversial topic,\nit brings us right into the\nrealm of what are called\nomega-3 fatty acids.\nI've talked many times\non this podcast about\nthe known benefits of omega-3\nfatty acids in particular,\ngetting a one gram 1000 milligrams or more\neven as much as 2000\nmilligrams each day of\nthe so-called EPA component\nof omega-3 fatty acids\nknown to have antidepressant effects,\nmood elevating effects,\nknown to have important effects\nprotecting the cardiovascular system.\nI think it's now clear that\nthe immune system also benefits\nthat omega-3 fatty acids that\ninclude a gram or more of EPA\nthat are very beneficial typically\nthat's done through fish oil,\nliquid fish oil is going to\nbe the most cost efficient,\nbut they're capsule forms\nfor those of you that don't like fish oil,\nyou can ingest this through other means\nyou can get it from certain\nalgaes or krill, et cetera.\nYou have to make it compatible\nwith your particular diet,\nwhether or not you're vegan\nor vegetarian or omnivore, et cetera.\nOmega-3s have shown,\nbeen shown to have all these\npositive health benefits.\nDo they have positive effects\non focus and attention?\nAnd the answer is you can find studies\nthat support that statement and\nthe effects are significant,\nbut the effects are modest.\nYou can also find studies\nthat show no effect,\nhowever much like with\nomega-3s and antidepressants,\nwhereby ingestion of omega-3\nfatty acids of a gram or\nmore of EPA per day allows\npeople with major depression\nto get away with taking lower doses\nof antidepressant medication.\nIt does seem that ingestion of\nomega-3 fatty acids in adults\nthat include EPA is of\n1000 milligrams or more\ncan allow adults with ADHD\nor mild attention deficit issues\nto function well on\nlower doses of medication\nand in rare cases to\neliminate medication entirely.\nSo what this says is once again,\nthat the omega-3 fatty\nacids are beneficial,\nwill they cure or eliminate ADHD?\nI think it's safe to say, no,\nthey are playing a supportive\nor what we call a modulatory role.\nJust like good sleep,\nplays a supportive and modulatory role\nfor essentially everything,\nyour immune system,\nyour ability to think your\nability to regulate your emotion,\nit's modulating that process.\nThis component of modulation\nis extremely important to highlight\nand I think I want to spend\na moment on it because\nthis is especially important\nin the context of ADHD\nand all the information that's out there.\nThere are biological\nprocesses that are mediated\nby particular compounds like dopamine.\nSo for instance, the\nability to feel motivated,\nto attend to focus is mediated\nby the circuits in the brain\nthat release dopamine.\nHowever, attention is also\nmodulating by how rested you are.\nIf you want to eliminate your\nability to think well at all,\njust stay up for two nights\nand don't sleep at all right?\nIf you do that,\nyou will have modulating\nthe circuits in your brain\nthat respond to various things\nand you will be highly distractible.\nYou'll be highly emotional.\nYou will feel like garbage,\nbut that doesn't mean that sleep mediates,\nfocus and attention.\nIt modulates it indirectly.\nLikewise, I think these\nomega-3 fatty acids\nin particular the EPA is which\nare so beneficial for mood\nand apparently also for attention,\nthey directly mediate attention and mood,\nwhat they do is they\nmodulate those circuits,\nthey make dopamine more available.\nThey make whatever dopamine is available,\nmore likely to bind to\nthe various receptors\nthat are present on neurons and so forth\nand I think this is very\nimportant because likewise diet\nin any discussion about nutrition\nhas to include this\nframework of is the diet,\nthe elimination diet,\nor whether or not it's some\nother diet or esoteric diet,\nketogenic diet, is it modulating\nor mediating a process?\nAnd most likely in the context of ADHD,\nit's modulating that process.\nSo if the ADHD is mild or\nif it's caught early enough,\nor if it's in conjunction\nwith pharmacology\nwith a prescription treatment,\nwell, then it might help\nguide the child or adult\nto a better place of being able to focus.\nBut it's not going to be the\nswitch that flips everything.\nNow that does not mean that\nconsuming the wrong foods,\nsugary foods or foods that\nyou happen to be allergic to\nis a good idea it will\nstill be detrimental.\nSo I hope that conceptual framework helps\nbecause if you go online,\nif you're somebody with ADHD\nor not your going to be\nbombarded with the ADHD diet,\nthe oligoantigenic diet,\nthe elimination this,\nthis supplement that EPA\nand I think it's very important\nto understand whether or not\nyou're talking about\nsomething mediating a process\nor modulating a process.\nNow drugs like Ritalin,\ndrugs like Adderall,\nthey are tapping into the circuitries\nand the neurochemistries that\nmediate attention and focus.\nThey are not the only\nalternatives or the only choices\nrather for treatment of these circuits\nand enhancement of the circuits for focus.\nI'm going to talk about other alternatives\nand some behavioral alternatives\nthat are not very well known,\nbut are very, very\neffective in a few minutes.\nBut I really want to make\nthis clear distinction\nbetween modulation and mediation,\nbecause it's vital for anyone\nthat's trying to modulate\nor mediate anything\nwithin their own brain.\nIf any of you are interested\nin this oligoantigenic diet,\nas it relates to ADHD,\nand you want to explore\na more recent study\nbesides that classic 2011 Lancet study,\nthat's rather controversial.\nThere's a paper that was\npublished in frontiers\nin psychiatry just last year, 2020.\nThe title of the paper is,\n\"Oligoantigenic diet\nimproves children's ADHD\nrating scale scores reliably\nin added video rating.\"\nThe added video rating is\njust that they're using\nan additional measure\nof focus and attention.\nAgain, that's Frontiers\nin psychiatry, 2020,\nI'll put a link to it in the caption,\nand that's a more recent\nstudy for you to peruse.\nSo we've talked about the\nneural circuits of focus\nand the chemistry of focus,\nbut we haven't talked yet\nabout what would make us better\nat focusing and what\nfocusing better really is.\nSo let's take a step back and think about\nhow we focus and how\nto get better at focus\nand I'm going to share with\nyou a tool for which there are\nterrific research data\nthat will allow you in a single session\nto enhance your ability to\nfocus in theory forever.\nWhat am I about to read you\nis from an excellent book\nthat I recommend,\nif any of you are\ninterested in neuroscience\nand things like meditation\nand default mode networks\nand things of that sort,\nthe book is called, \"Altered Traits.\"\nScience reveals how\nmeditation changes your mind,\nbrain and body and no,\nI'm not going to try\nand convince you to meditate.\nI'm going to share with you\na small passage in the book\nthat relates some research\ndata related to focus\nthat are very important.\nIf you want to meditate,\nthat's your choice.\nThat's a separate matter.\nThis is a book by Daniel\nGoleman and Richard Davidson\nand I should just mention that\nGoleman is a well-known author\nhas written books on emotional\nintelligence and so forth.\nRichard Davidson is also a PhD.\nHe's a professor of\npsychology and psychiatry,\nand he's at a University\nof Wisconsin Madison,\nhe's done terrific work on brain states\nand modulation of brain\nstates and so forth.\nWhat we're about to talk about is\nwhen attention works and\nwhen attention falters\nand what we are specifically\ngoing to talk about\nare what are called attentional blinks,\nnot actual eye blinks.\nWe're going to talk about\nthat in a few minutes,\nbut we're going to talk\nabout attentional blinks.\nI'm paraphrasing here because\nGoleman and Davidson wrote\nabout this so beautifully.\nI'd rather paraphrase from\nthem than try and just\nmake up a new way to say it\nthat is less interesting or less good,\nbut I want to credit them.\nAttentional blinks are\nreally easy to understand,\nif you think about a where's Waldo task,\nyou know this task where's Waldo where,\nthere are a bunch of people and objects\nand things in a picture\nand somewhere in there is Waldo\nwith the striped hat and the\nglasses and go skinny dude,\nand you have to find Waldo\nand so it's a visual search\nand it's visual search for an object\nthat has distinct features,\nbut is embedded in this\nocean of other things that\ncould easily be confused as Waldo.\nSo you tend to look, look,\nlook, look, look, look, look, look, look,\nand then you find Waldo.\nKids can do this they enjoy doing this.\nAdults may or may not enjoy it,\nbut they can do it too.\nThey find Waldo, when you find Waldo\nor when you search for a target\nin some other visual\nsearch task at that moment,\nyour nervous system\ncelebrates a little bit\nand it celebrates through\nthe release of neurochemicals\nthat make you feel good,\nyou found it and you pause.\nNow, the pause is interesting\nbecause when you pause,\nwhat we know from many experiments is that\nin that moment of pause\nand mild celebration,\nhowever, mild you are not\nable to see another Waldo\nsitting right next to it.\nSo what this means is in\nattending to something\nin searching and in\nidentifying a visual target\nyour attention blinked\nit shut off for a second\nand there's a more formal\nand more laboratory type\nway that we look at this.\nThe more typical way to\ndo this is to give someone\na string of letters or a string of numbers\nand beforehand you tell them\nbe on the lookout for the\nletters R and Z, okay?\nYou're just going to watch\nthis string of numbers go by\nand there will be a letter R in there,\nand there will be a letter Z in there\nand try and spot them both\nand what you find is when you present\nthat string of numbers,\nand then they see the R,\nthey see the R they\nregister it consciously\nand they tend to miss the Z,\njust like in the Waldo type example.\nNow, of course the numbers\nare going by pretty quickly,\nbut they can spot the R.\nThey could also spot the Z,\nif you told them\nbeforehand, just spot the Z\nand the numbers are moving\nthrough at the same rate\nin both conditions.\nSo what that means is that in every case,\nyou are capable of seeing the R or the Z\nit's when you try and see\nboth that seeing the first one\nprevents you from seeing the second one,\nit's what we call an attentional blink.\nWe do this all the time\nand people with ADHD\ntend to have many more\nattentional blinks than people that don't\nand this is true for\nchildren and for adults.\nThis is an important point.\nSo important that I want\nto emphasize it twice\nin case you attentionally blinked.\nIf you see something\nthat you're looking for,\nor you're very interested in something,\nyou are definitely\nmissing other information\nin part because you're\nover focusing on something\nand this leads to a very\ninteresting hypothesis\nabout what might go wrong in ADHD,\nwhere we've always thought\nthat they cannot focus\nand yet we know they can focus on things\nthey care very much about,\nwell, maybe just maybe\nthey are experiencing\nmore attentional blinks\nthan people who do not have ADHD\nand indeed, there are data\nnow to support the possibility\nthat that's actually what's happening\nand that should be exciting\nto anyone that has ADHD.\nIt should also be exciting\nto anyone that cares about\nincreasing their focus and\ntheir ability to attend.\nWhat this is saying is\nthat these circuits,\nthat underlie focus in\nour ability to attend\nand our ability to eliminate distraction,\nthey aren't just failing to focus.\nThat's just a semantic way\nof describing the outcome.\nThey are over focusing on certain things\nand thereby missing other things.\nAnd so our distractability\nor the distractability\nof somebody with ADHD could exist because\nthey are over focusing on certain elements\nand there are there for missing\nother elements that they\nshould be attending to.\nSo what they really need is this property\nthat we call open monitoring.\nNow open monitoring is something\nthat's described in the\nbook that I just referred to\nand that typically is\nassociated with people\nwho have done a lot of meditation,\nso called Vipassana meditation,\nor have spent a lot of\ntime learning how to\ndo what's called open gaze visual analysis\nand open gaze thinking.\nBut there's a simpler version of this\nthat allows us to bypass all that.\nFirst of all,\nyour visual system has\ntwo modes of processing.\nIt can be highly focused,\na soda straw view.\nSo looking for the R in\nthis string of numbers\nin the example that I just gave,\nor if you're very excited about something\nyou're in that soda\nstraw view of the world,\nand you're missing other things, okay,\nthat's high levels of attention.\nHowever, there's also a\nproperty of your visual system\nthat allows you to dilate your gaze,\nto be in so-called panoramic vision.\nPanoramic vision is something\nyou can do right now,\nno matter where you are,\nand I can do it right now,\nyou won't know that I'm doing it,\nbut even though I'm still\nlooking directly at you,\nI'm consciously dilating my\ngaze so that I can see the\nceiling, the floor and\nthe walls all around me.\nThat panoramic vision\nis actually mediated by\na separate stream or\nset of neural circuits\ngoing from the eye into the brain\nand it's a stream or set of circuits\nthat isn't just wide angle view.\nIt also is better at\nprocessing things in time.\nIts frame rate is higher.\nSo you've seen slow motion video,\nand you've seen standard video,\nslow motion video gives\nyou that slow motion look,\nbecause it's a higher frame rate.\nYou're thin slicing time, okay?\nYou can use panoramic\nvision to access the state\nthat we call open monitoring.\nWhen people do that,\nthey are able to attend to and recognize\nmultiple targets within\nthis string of numbers.\nThey can see the R and they can see the Z\nand they can see additional things.\nSo this is something\nthat can be trained up\nand people can practice whether or not\nthey have ADHD or not.\nWhat involves is learning\nhow to dilate your gaze consciously,\nthat's actually quite\neasy for most people,\nwhether or not you wear corrective lenses\nor contacts or not\nyou can consciously go into open gaze\nand then you can contract\nyour field of view as well.\nThere have also been studies done\nwhere people were taught to\nthink in a particular way\nfor a very short period of time,\nand that forever changed\ntheir ability to limit\nor reduce the number of\nthese attentional blinks.\nThere are now published\naccounts in the literature\nof a simple practice done\nfor about 15 minutes,\nwhere subjects were asked to\njust sit quietly eyes closed\nand do what is sort of akin to meditation,\nbut to not direct their mind\ninto any particular state or place,\nbut simply to think about their breathing\nand to focus on their\nso-called interoception,\nfocus on how their body feels,\ntheir mind drifted to bring it back, okay?\nSo it's basically meditation\nfor about 15 minutes.\nThat might not seem like a\nsignificant or unusual practice\nor that it would have any impact at all.\nBut remarkably, just doing\nthat once for 17 minutes,\nsignificantly reduced the\nnumber of attentional blinks\nthat people would carry out.\nIn other words, their focus got better\nin a near permanent way without\nany additional training.\nThere's something about that\npractice of reducing the amount\nof visual information coming in\nand learning to pay attention\nto one's internal state,\nwhat we call interoception\nthat allow them an awareness,\nsuch that when they needed\nto look for visual targets,\nwhen they need to focus on\nmultiple things in sequence,\nthey didn't experience\nthe same number of attentional blinks\nand I should mention not\nincidentally as people age\nand their working memory gets worse\nand their ability to focus gets worse,\nthe number of attentional blinks\nthat they carry out goes up,\nand there are now studies\nexploring whether or not\nthe simple meditation like\npractice of 15 to 20 minutes\nor so of sitting and just quietly resting\nand paying attention to one's breathing\nand internal state can\nalso offset some of that\nage-related what is\ncalled cognitive decline.\nSo what these data tell me is that\nregardless of whether\nor not you're a child\nor you're an adult,\nwhether or not you have ADHD or not,\nwhether or not you're experiencing\nage-related cognitive decline,\nor you would simply like to avoid\nage-related cognitive decline,\na simple practice of taking 17 minutes\nsitting and paying attention\nto your internal state,\njust interocepting,\nregistering your breathing,\nregistering the contact of your skin\nwith whatever surface you're on,\ncan forever rewire your brain\nto be able to attend better\nand possibly even offset\nsome of that age related\nattentional drift.\nNow, I don't expect anyone to\nstart meditating regularly.\nI don't expect anyone to do\nanything they don't want to do,\nbut I think most of us could handle\none meditation's session\nof 17 minutes or so\nand so if ever there was a\ntool that stood to rewire\nour attentional circuitry\nin a powerful way.\nThis seems to be it\nand in addition, the ability\nto engage in panoramic vision,\nto dilate our gaze,\nthe so-called open monitoring\nthat allows the brain\nto function in a way\nthat it can detect more\ninformation faster,\nthat's a powerful tool as well\nand the beauty of that tool is\nthat it works the first time\nand it works every time.\nNow, how exactly it works\nis a little bit unclear.\nIs it for instance,\norchestrating this synchrony or asynchrony\nbetween the default mode network\nand the task related\nnetworks we don't know.\nThose studies have not\nyet been carried out.\nNonetheless, the effects are significant,\nthey are long lasting\nand they appear to exist\nafter just one session of this quiet\n17 minute interoception,\nwhich to me makes it seem like\na very worthwhile thing\nto do for everybody.\nSo we just talked about\nattentional blinks,\nwhich are essentially blinks of thinking\nit's your mind shutting off for a moment\nand missing information.\nNow let's talk about actual blinks,\nthe sort that you do with your eyelids.\nNow, this might come\nacross as somewhat obvious,\nbut you can do fast, what\nare called spontaneous blinks\nand they're always coordinated\nbetween the two eyes\nor you can do long blinks\nlike when you go to sleep at night,\nyou do one very long blink,\nand I'm not being facetious.\nWhen you go to sleep at night,\nyou are shutting your eyelids\nand you are limiting the\namount of information coming in\nand your perception of\ntime starts to drift\nas you go into sleep.\nYour perception of time\nchanges from very fast,\nat one moment to very slow\nmeaning the frame rate\nat which you are analyzing\ninformation dreaming, et cetera,\nis variable when you were in sleep,\nsometimes it's very fast.\nMeaning you experienced\nthings in slow motion.\nSometimes it's very fast.\nIn waking to your experience of time\ncan sometimes be very fast\nsometimes be very slow.\nTypically the more alert you\nare, the higher the frame rate,\nyour thin slicing your experience.\nYou've probably had this happen.\nIf you're ever very stressed\nand you're waiting for\nsomething or somebody,\nit seems like it takes forever because\nyour frame rate is higher\nyou're analyzing time more finely.\nConversely, if you are very\nrelaxed or even sleepy,\nyou wake up and you have to think of\nall the things you have to do.\nIt will seem like the world\nis going by very, very fast\nand that you are moving very slow.\nTime is going at the same rate,\nbut your perception of\ntime is what's changed.\nBelieve it or not.\nYour perception of time is\nalso changed on a rapid basis.\nMoment to moment basis\nby how often you blink.\nThis is a well-established literature\nin the world of neuroscience\nthat unlike the literature\nand claims about blinking and sociopathy,\nwhich have no basis,\nthe science of blinking as\nit relates to time perception\nhas some very good data to support it.\nI want to just emphasize\none study in particular,\nwhich is quite appropriately titled,\n\"Time dilates after spontaneous blinking.\"\nThis is a paper that was\npublished in current biology.\nThe first author is\nTerhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.\nIt's a wonderful paper.\nThey examine the relationship\nbetween fluctuations in timing\nand blinking and to\nmake a long story short\nwhat they found is that\nright after blinks,\nwe reset our perception of time, okay?\nSo blinks in that sense\nare a little bit like\nthe curtain coming down on a scene\nbetween scenes in a play\nor takes in a movie, and\nthey clap the clap thing,\nthey started take in our,\nwhat do they say, action\nand then at the end they do the\nthing and they click it down\nand they say, it's a take that's one take\nwhen you blink it's a take, okay?\nNow what's interesting\nand will immediately make\nsense to you as to why\nthis is important is\nthat the rate of blinking\nis controlled by dopamine.\nSo what this means is that dopamine\nis controlling attention.\nBlinks relate to attention and focus,\nand therefore the dopamine\nand blinking system is one way\nthat you constantly modulate and update\nyour perception of time\nand fortunately, it's also\none that you can control.\nSo the basic takeaway of\nthis study was that blinking\ncontrols time perception,\nbut also that levels of dopamine\ncan alter your sense of\ntime and stay with me here,\nand that blinking and dopamine\nare inextricably linked.\nThey are working together\nto control your attention.\nWhen dopamine levels go up,\npeople tend to overestimate\nhow long something lasted, why?\nBecause they are\nprocessing time more finely\nit's slow motion mode.\nWhen dopamine levels are lower,\nthey tend to underestimate time intervals.\nLet's remember back to the\nvery beginning of the episode,\nwhat's going on in people with ADHD,\nthey are not good at managing their time,\nthey tend to run late,\nor they are disorganized.\nThey are not just disorganized in space,\nmeaning in that physical\nspace, around them,\nthey're disorganized in time.\nTheir dopamine is low,\nwe know that as well\nand so they are\nunderestimating time intervals\nand so it makes perfect sense\nthat they would be late.\nIt makes perfect sense that\nthey would lose track of time\nor the ability to focus.\nThis is really exciting\nbecause what it means is that\nchildren with ADHD, adults, with ADHD\nor people with normal levels of focus\nthat want to improve\ntheir ability to focus\ncan do so through a training that involves\nlearning how often to blink and when,\nand how to keep their visual\nfocus on a given target\nand it turns out this study\nhas actually been done.\nThere's a study again,\nI'll link to the study,\nentitled \"Improvement of attention\nin elementary school students\nthrough fixation focused\ntraining activity.\"\nI won't go through all the details,\nbut what they found was a short period of\nfocusing on a visual target,\nallowed the school\nchildren to greatly enhance\ntheir ability to focus on\nother types of information\nand a significant component\nof the effect was due\nto the way that they were\ncontrolling the shutters\non their eyes, their eyelids,\nand controlling their blinks.\nSo what they did in this\nstudy is they had these kids\nfocus their visual attention\non some object that was relatively close,\nlike their hand for a minute or so,\nwhich actually takes some\neffort if you try and do that,\nthey were allowed to blink.\nHowever, it's known from other work\nthat if people can consciously\noverride the desire to blink,\nat least to the point where\nthey feel like they have to,\nor else their eyes were dry out,\nthat actually can increase\nattention even further\nand they had conditions where\nthey would look at a point\nfurther across the room and\neven further across the room.\nIt only took a few minutes\neach day to do this\n30 seconds in one\ncondition, or maybe a minute\nand then at another station\nof looking a little bit further out\nand a little bit further out, however,\nthere was an important\nfeature of this study\nthat is definitely worth mentioning,\nwhich is before they did this\nvisual focus, task or training,\nthey did a series of physical\nmovements with the kids\nso that the kids could sort\nof eliminate or move out\nsome of their desire to move\nand would thereby enhance\ntheir ability to sit still.\nNow it's long been known\nthat kids need a recess,\nthey need time to run around\nand play and roll around,\ndo whatever it is that they do\nin order to be able to sit still at all.\nAdults probably need this too, frankly,\nbut kids need it more because\nthe circuits in the brain\nthat control reflexive\nmovements and as we say,\nkind of rhythmic undulating\nbehavior and things like that,\nthat's an active suppression\nand kids have less of\nthat circuitry built up\nuntil they hit about age 15 or 16.\nSo they had the kids move around a bit\nand then do this focus training.\nThat brings me to another treatment\nthat's actively used nowadays\nin schools for kids with ADHD,\nbut also is starting\nto be used by many kids\nand by parents in order to\nkeep their kids focusing\nand not going crazy in the car\nor not acting out in general\nand that's the prevalence of\nthese so-called fidgeter toys\nor things that kids can do actively\nand repetitively in order to move out\nsome of their underlying\nreverberatory activity\nin their nervous system.\nSo what you will find is\nthat some kids with ADHD\nare now given a rubber band on their desk,\nliterally a rubber band\nthat's attached to their desk\nand they're able to pull on it,\neven snap it against the desk,\nif I had done that when I was a kid,\nI think my teachers were\nthrow me out of class,\nbut I think it's great\nthat they're allowing them\nto do this now as a way of moving\nsome of their physical energy out\nor engage their physical energy, rather,\nas opposed to trying to sit\nstatue still all the time and attend\nand it turns out that does\nenhance these children's ability\nto focus mentally when they\nhave some physical activity\nto attend to and it turns out\nit also can work for adults.\nI'll share with you I related anecdote\nbecause it illustrates\nthe underlying mechanism.\nI've had the great privilege\nof being able to do a number of\nsurgeries, brain surgeries\nduring my career.\nSo one thing you find when\nyou do brain surgeries,\nis that the brain's pretty small\nregardless of the species\nthat you're working on\nand you're in there\nand you're trying to do\nsomething very specific\nand the more you try\nand hold your hands really steady,\nthe more they want to shake, all right?\nSo it's not natural for any of our limbs\nto sit perfectly still,\ndepending on how much coffee you had,\nhow well rested you are\nand your sort of baseline\nlevel of autonomic arousal.\nSome of you may find that\nyou can hold out your hand,\nabsolutely rock solid, others\nwill shake a little bit more.\nIt doesn't mean you're if you're shaking,\ndoesn't mean you're calm if you're still.\nWhat it relates to\nis the amount of what we\ncall premotor activity,\nthe number of commands to move\nthat are being sent through the system\nand that's what I mean\nby reverberatory activity\nand it does seem that kids\nwith ADHD and adults with ADHD\nhave a lot of reverberatory activity\nin their nervous system\nand so that's that constant desire to move\nit's hard for them to sit still\nand therefore it's hard\nfor them to attend,\nto harness their attention.\nWhen you do a surgery\nand you find that your hands are shaking,\nwhat you learn from your mentors,\nwhich I did and what works extremely well,\nwhether or not you're\ndoing a surgery or not,\nis that you simply tap your foot\nor you bounce your knee a little bit,\nwhich you might think would\nmake your hand shake even more,\nbut provided that it's subtle.\nWhat it does is it actually\nshuttle some of the activity\nfrom those premotor circuits\nto elsewhere in the body\nand then you're able to sit\nmuch more still with your hand,\nyou're able to perform the\nsurgery with much more precision.\nYou are able to write with\nmuch better handwriting\nand for those of you who\nengage in public speaking,\nif you ever too nervous,\nthat's why pacing while\nyou public speak helps\nif you're nervous,\nthat's why bouncing your\nknee behind the podium\nworks as well.\nThat's why nodding your head\nand gesticulating can help.\nIt's not a matter of,\n\"Moving energy out of the body.\"\nThat doesn't actually happen,\nwhat it is you're engaging\nthose premotor circuits\nthat are sending through commands.\nIt's like trying to stuff,\na bunch of stuff through a funnel,\nand it creates this tension,\nso you're giving it an outlet\nfor the neural circuitry\nto be able to move something\nso that you can keep other\ncomponents of your body\nand your mental attention engaged\nand locked onto something\nwhat we call focus.\nOne thing related to this\nwhole business of blinking\nand focus and training yourself to focus\nand not blinking, et cetera,\nis that most all of the drugs,\nRitalin, Adderall, and recreational drugs\nthat increase dopamine,\neven coffee and tea and\nother forms of caffeine,\nthey tend to make us blink less\nand when we get tired,\nwe tend to blink more.\nNow this is sort of a duh, right?\nBut being wide-eyed\nwith excitement or fear\nor with your eyes, barely\nbeing able to keep them open,\nnow it should make perfect\nsense that these shutters\non the front of your eyes,\nthey aren't just there for winking\nand they aren't just there\nfor cosmetic purposes.\nThey are there to regulate\nthe amount of information\ngoing into your nervous system\nand they're there to regulate how long\nyou are bringing information\ninto your nervous system\nand in what bins, how widely or finely\nyou are binning time is\nset by how often you blink\nand how widely or specifically\nyou are grabbing attention\nfrom the visual world is set\nby whether or not you're\nviewing things very specifically\nlike a cross area through a\nsoda straw view like this,\nor whether or not you\nwere in this panoramic\nsort of whole environment mode,\nthis kind of fisheye lens\nor wide angle lens mode\nand in fairness to the\npharmacology and the circuitry,\nwhile dopamine and heightened\nlevels of alertness\nand excitement tend to make\nus blink less and attend more.\nThere's actually a study that's looked at\nthe other neurochemical systems\nand drugs and how those relate to blinking\nand so this will all be obvious\nby the title of the paper\nI'm about to share with you.\nThis is a paper entitled,\n\"Decreased spontaneous eyeblink rates\nin chronic cannabis users,\nevidence for stride or cannabinoid,\ndopamine interactions.\"\nOkay, I'm not going to go\ninto all the details here,\nbut one thing that is\nsomewhat surprising is that\nmany people with ADHD\nuse or abuse cannabis,\nyou might think, well,\nwhy would they do that?\nBecause I thought that\na increase in dopamine\nis actually what's going to lead\nto heightened levels of attention\nand that's what these\npeople in children crave.\nWell, it turns out that cannabis also\nincreases dopamine\ntransmission in the brain,\nbut because of the other chemicals,\nit increases namely serotonin\nand some components of the\ncannabinoid and opioid system,\nit creates that kind of\nalert, but mellow feel\nand again, here I'm not\na proponent of this,\nI personally am not a\nTHC or cannabis user.\nIt's just not my thing\nand obviously it's illegal some places\nand so you have to\ndetermine that for yourself\nit does have medical purposes\nin some places it is legal,\nbut THC increases dopamine\nand increases neurochemicals\nthat can also create a state of calm.\nSo it's that sort of middle ground\nand this paper has a\nbeautiful demonstration\nwhereby not just while\npeople are using cannabis,\nbut depending on how\nlong they've been using\ncannabis across their lifespan,\nthe rates of eye blinking change.\nSo if you look at the number of years\nthat people have been using\ncannabis on a regular basis,\neither daily or up to excuse\nme, weekly, or up to daily,\nwhat you find is that for people\nthat have not been using cannabis at all,\nor have only been using\nit for about two years,\ntheir rates of eye blinks are much higher\nthan people who've been using\nit chronically for 10 years.\nIn other words, people\nwho may be using cannabis for 10 years,\ndon't blink very often at all.\nNow cannabis has well known\neffects in depleting memory,\nbut it does seem to engage the focus\nand blinking system in a\nway that increases focus.\nSo basically what I'm saying is\nmarijuana seems to\nincrease people's focus,\nbut then they can't remember\nwhat they were focusing on.\nSomething I'd like to discuss\njust briefly is the so-called\ninteroceptive awareness that's\npresent in people with ADHD,\nboth children and adults.\nInteroceptive awareness is one sense\nof one's own internal state heartbeat,\nbreathing contact of skin with\na given surface, et cetera.\nFor a long time, there\nwas this hypothesis,\nthis idea that people with ADHD,\nwere just not in touch with how they felt\nthat somehow they weren't registering\nall the stuff that was\ngoing on inside them\nchanges in heart rate and so forth\nand so they were behaving in a way\nthat was dysregulated\nor appear dysregulated,\nand that if they could\njust learn to attend\nto their internal state better,\nthat somehow they would\nfunction better in the world.\nNow, before we described a process,\nliterally a 17 minute\ninteroceptive exercise\nthat does seem to lead to improvements\nin one's ability to focus\nfor a longer period of time.\nHowever, it's very unlikely\nthat that was due to\nincreasing interoceptive awareness per se.\nIt probably wasn't because\npeople gain a much heightened\nor improved ability to understand\nwhat's going on internally.\nIn fact, you can imagine\nhow that might actually\nprevent one's ability to\npay attention to things\nin the outside world.\nSo while there is benefit\nto just sitting there\nand being in stillness, as they say,\nor focusing on one's\nbreathing and internal state\nfor sake of then accessing information\nin the external world,\na really nice study called\ninteroceptive awareness\nand attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder\nexplored whether or not\ninteroceptive awareness\nwas different in people with\nADHD or did not have ADHD\nand the findings were essentially\nthat there's no difference\nthat people with ADHD,\nchildren, and adults,\nthey are aware of what's\ngoing on inside them\njust as much as anyone else's\nand the typical measure\nof interoceptive awareness\nis one's ability to count\ntheir own heartbeats.\nThis is actually challenging\nfor some individuals\nand very easy for other individuals,\nregardless of their attentional capacity.\nSome people just can\nreally feel their heartbeat\nwithout taking their\npulse other people cannot\nand these studies are pretty\nstraightforward to do.\nYou ask people to sit there\nand to count their heartbeats,\nand then you are\nmonitoring their heartbeats\nand you get to gauge\nhow accurate they are.\nSo it's important to understand\nthat people with ADHD\nare in touch with how they feel.\nIt's really a question of whether or not\nthey can take the demands\nthat are placed upon them\nand enter a cognitive\nstate of mental state\nthat allows them to access the information\nthey need to access\nin other words, whether\nor not they can focus,\nbut it is absolutely wrong to think that\nthe child that's getting\nup 11 times during a short\nsix minute interaction at the table,\nor whether or not a child who\nsomehow has to venture off every moment\nor a coworker of yours\nwho's an adult who's constantly fidgeting\nor moving things around that\nsomehow they are unaware\nthat they are oblivious,\nthey're not oblivious to how they feel.\nChances are they're very\nchallenged in the situations\nthat they're in\nand they're doing\neverything they can to try\nand regulate their attention.\nSo I think it's an\nimportant study to highlight\nbecause it really\nunderscores the fact that\nsomething else is going on\nand that something else\nhas everything to do\nwith this ability to coordinate\nthese tasks directed networks,\nand to coordinate that in the proper way\nwith that default mode network\nand that is a process as you now know,\nthat's regulated exquisitely\nby certain neurochemicals\nand in particular the\nneurochemicals, dopamine,\nnorepinephrine and serotonin,\nand a fourth one I'd like\nto throw into the mix,\nwhich is acetylcholine,\nwhich is very vital for cognitive focus.\nSo now I want to switch\nback to talking about\nsome of the drugs that are typically used\nto access those systems,\nprescription drugs\nand I want to talk about\nsome of the new and emerging\nnon-prescription approaches\nto increasing the levels of dopamine,\nacetylcholine and serotonin in the brain\nusing various supplement type compounds,\nbecause several of them are showing\nreally remarkable efficacy\nin excellent peer reviewed studies.\nSo before moving to some of\nthe newer atypical compounds\nand things sold over the counter,\nI'd like to just briefly\nreturn to the classic drugs\nthat are used to treat ADHD.\nThese are the ones I mentioned earlier,\nmethylphenidate also called Ritalin,\nModafinil or armodafinil is\nanother one and Adderall,\nagain, all of these work by\nincreasing levels of\ndopamine and norepinephrine.\nTypically they're taken\norally in pill form,\nor sometimes in capsule form\nthe dosages that are appropriate vary,\naccording to severity of the condition\nfor a given person and\nthe age of the person.\nThis is a complicated\nlandscape for each individual.\nThey have to figure out the pharmacology\nthat's best for them.\nSome individuals are even layering long\nor time to release Ritalin\nwith Adderall in smaller doses,\nit can get quite complex or it\ncan be quite straightforward\nif you are really\ninterested in these drugs\nand how they work\nand you'd like to get a glance\nat a table of all the results\nfrom all the studies of\nwhich there are now hundreds,\nthere's an excellent review\nabout these drugs and their use\nand their comparison to\nsimilarly structured drugs\nin particular MDMA and\ncocaine and amphetamine,\nmeaning Street Amphetamine\nto really illustrate the similarities\nof action and some of\nthe problems associated\nwith long-term use.\nI don't expect you to\nread this article in full\nI'm here so that you don't\nhave to go read these articles,\nbut in case you want a ton of information,\nthe paper is Esposito et al\nFrontiers and bio-sciences,\nit's an excellent, excellent\nreview of the entire literature.\nIt is quite long.\nI can put a link to that\nstudy in our caption,\nand it essentially\ndescribes all the studies\nthat have been done, peer\nreviewed and published,\nand it refers to these\ndrugs in an interesting way.\nIt doesn't just refer these\ndrugs as for treatment of ADHD.\nIt actually refers to them\nusing language that ordinarily\nI'm not very fond of,\nbut I'll agree to here,\nwhich is so-called smart\ndrugs or nootropics.\nIt also covers caffeine, which\nagain as I mentioned earlier,\nincreases dopamine norepinephrine\nand to some extent serotonin,\nbut what I like about this\nreview so much is that\nin putting, these drugs of abuse,\nmethamphetamine, and cocaine,\nright alongside these drugs,\nlike Ritalin and Adderall\nand also caffeine,\nwe start to realize that\nthe distinction between\ndrugs of abuse\nand the distinction\nbetween drugs of treatment\nis actually a very fine and\nsometimes even a blurry line\nand in thinking about whether\nor not one wants to use\nthese prescription, I want\nto emphasize prescription,\nnot drugs of abuse,\nbut prescription drugs\nfor treatment of one's\nown attentional capacity.\nI think it is important to understand\nthe extent to which they all carry\nmore or less the same side effects.\nThe one exception being\ncaffeine caffeine side effects\ncan be anxiety if you ingest\ntoo much of it, insomnia,\nif you drink it too late in the day,\nbut typically it will not\ncause the major side effects\nof the other drugs,\nsuch as high propensity\nfor addiction and abuse.\nAmphetamines of any\nkind as well as cocaine\ncan cause sexual side effects\nbecause they're vasoconstrictors.\nSo, men have trouble achieving erection,\nthere can often be the intense\ndesire or libido for sex,\nbut an inability to actually perform.\nSo that's an issue with\nany kind of stimulant.\nSo these drugs are not\nwithout their consequences.\nIn addition, and here I'd lump\ncaffeine back into the mix.\nIn addition, they almost all\ncarry cardiac effects, right?\nThey increase heart rate,\nbut they also have effects on\nconstriction of blood vessels\nand arteries and veins\nand so forth in ways\nthat can create cardiovascular problems.\nNow, caffeine is a bit\nof a complicated one.\nI talked about this on a podcast long ago,\nbut I'll just remind you that it turns out\nthat if you are caffeine\nadapted, in other words,\nif you are used to drinking caffeine\nthen the ingestion of caffeine,\nmost often will cause vasodilation\nwho actually allow more\nblood flow through.\nHowever, if you are not caffeine adapted,\nit will cause vasoconstriction\ndue to an increased stress response.\nSo if you're familiar with caffeine,\ncaffeine can actually\nhave a little bit more\nof a relaxation response\nalthough if you drink enough of it,\nit will make you amped up.\nThese other drugs, almost\nalways lead to vasoconstriction,\nincreased heart rate dilation\nof the pupils, less blinking,\nheightened levels of attention,\nwhich looks very much like stress\nand at its extremes looks very much\nlike the effects of street drugs,\nlike cocaine and amphetamine.\nBecause of the large amounts of\ndopamine that released in the brain.\nPeople tend to crave\nthat state over and over\nand yet with each subsequent use\nare able to get less and less\nof that euphoric feeling\nor that really, really focused feeling.\nSo one thing that's being\nexplored quite extensively now\nin the treatment of\nADHD are drug schedules.\nWhether or not people should\ntake Adderall every day\nor every other day,\nwhether or not they should take it\nonly every once in a while,\nwhether or not young children\ncan take it just a few times\nand engage in behavioral\ntraining of the sort\nthat I talked about before,\nwhere they're doing,\nmaybe it's a 17 minute\nmeditation type exercise,\nbut more likely it would be the movement\nfollowed by the visual focusing,\ncause that's only done for\n20 or 30 or 60 seconds.\nWhy would you do that?\nWell in a chemically enhanced state,\nyour brain is more plastic.\nThe circuits are able to\nmodify and learn better.\nThat's the optimal time to engage in focus\nin a very deliberate way.\nSo just taking a drug and expecting\nfocus to just work at any point\nand being able to turn\nfocus on and off at will,\nthat's an unrealistic expectation, right?\nMore likely the best use of\nthings like Adderall, Modafinil,\narmodafinil and Ritalin is going to be\nto combine those treatments\nwith behavioral exercises\nthat actively engage the very circuits\nthat you're trying to train up and enhance\nand then perhaps I want\nto highlight perhaps\ntapering off those drugs\nso that then one can use those circuits\nwithout any need for\nchemical intervention.\nSo despite any controversy\nthat might be out there,\nI think it's fair to say that\nthe consumption of omega-3 fatty acids\ncan positively modulate\nthe systems for attention and focus.\nSo then the question becomes how much EPA,\nhow much DHA does that differ for,\nwhat's helpful for depression, et cetera\nand actually it does differ\nin reviewing the studies for this\nit appears that a threshold\nlevel of 300 milligrams of DHA\nturns out to be an\nimportant inflection point.\nSo typically fish oils or\nother sources of omega-3s\nwill have DHA and EPA\nand typically it's the EPA\nthat's harder to get at sufficient levels,\nmeaning you have to take\nquite a lot of fish oil\nin order to get above that 1000 milligram\nor 2000 milligram\nthreshold to improve mood\nand other functions.\nBut for sake of attention,\nthere are 10 studies that\nhave explored this in detail\nand while the EPA component is important,\nthe most convincing studies\npoint to the fact that getting\nabove 300 milligrams per day\nof DHA is really where you\nstart to see the attentional effects.\nNow, fortunately, if you're\ngetting sufficient EPA\nfor sake of mood and other\nbiological functions,\nalmost without question,\nyou're getting 300\nmilligrams or more of DHA.\nSo that usually checks that box just fine.\nWhat's interesting is that\nthere's another compound\nphosphatidylserine that has\nbeen explored for its capacity\nto improve the symptoms of ADHD.\nAgain, I don't think\nthis is any direct way,\nbut rather in a modulatory way,\nbut it appears that phosphatidylserine\ntaken for two months for\n200 milligrams per day,\nwas able to reduce the\nsymptoms of ADHD in children.\nIt has not been looked\nat in adults yet as,\nat least as far as I know,\nbut that this effect was greatly enhanced\nby the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.\nSo now we're starting to\nsee synergistic effects\nof omega-3 fatty acids\nand phosphatidylserine\nagain that was 200 milligrams per day.\nThis is something that sold\nover the counter in capsule\nform, at least in the U.S.\nthere were two studies,\nboth were double-blind studies.\nI carried out for anywhere\nfrom one to six months on both\nboys and girls and it\nreally was boys and girls,\nnot men and women.\nThis was kids age one\nto six or seven to 12,\nand it was a fairly\nlarge number of subjects.\nSo 147 subjects in one\ncase in 36 in the other,\nthe takeaway is that getting\nsufficient levels of EPA\nand particularly there's 300\nmilligram threshold of DHA,\nplus, if you are interested\nin it and it's right for you,\n200 milligrams of phosphatidylserine\ncan be an important augment\nfor improving the symptoms of ADHD.\nYou'll also find literature out there\nand many claims about\nso-called Ginkgo Biloba,\nwhich has been shown to have minor effects\nin improving the symptoms of ADHD,\nnot nearly as effective\nas Ritalin and Adderall.\nGinkgo Biloba is not\nappropriate for many people.\nI am one such person, I don't have ADHD,\nbut when I'd taken Gingko,\neven at very low doses,\nI get absolutely splitting headaches.\nSome people do not\nexperience those headaches,\nbut it's known to have very\npotent vasoconstrictive\nand vasodilating properties\nthat vary depending on\nwhen you took the compound.\nSo for those of you that\nare exploring Ginkgo Biloba,\nand you will see a lot of\nclaims about Ginkgo Biloba\nfor attention in ADHD\ndefinitely take the vasodilation\nvasoconstriction headache\nissue into consideration.\nSo I'd like to talk\nabout the drug Modafinil\nand the closely related drug armodafinil\nthat's AR Modafinil.\nBecause Modafinil and armodafinil\nare gaining popularity out there,\nboth for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy,\nbut also for communities of people\nthat are trying to stay\nawake long periods of time.\nSo it's actively used in the\nmilitary by first responders,\nit's gaining popularity\non college campuses\nand people are using it more\nand more as an alternative\nto Adderall and Ritalin and\nexcessive amounts of coffee.\nIt does increase focus\nand to a dramatic extent,\nModafinil typically was very expensive,\nI don't know if it's still this expensive,\nbut when one has a prescription for it,\nit could still cost as\nmuch as eight or $900\neven $1000 a month.\nArmodafinil is a far\nless expensive version,\nthat's chemically slightly\ndifferent than Modafinil.\nRegardless of price\npeople are taking\nModafinil and armodafinil.\nWant to emphasize that\nunlike Ritalin and Adderall,\nModafinil and armodafinil\nare weak dopamine\nre-uptake inhibitors,\nand that's how they lead\nto increases in dopamine.\nSo, whereas Ritalin and\nAdderall, amphetamine,\nand cocaine lead to big\nincreases in dopamine\nalso through re-uptake\nmechanisms and so forth\nModafinil is a weaker\ndopamine re-uptake stimulator\nand so what that means is that it leaves\nmore dopamine around to\nbe active at the synopsis,\nthe gaps between neurons,\nhowever, it also activates other systems.\nIt acts on the orexin system,\nwhich is actually a peptide\nthat we talked about\nin the episode on hunger,\nbecause it regulates hunger and appetite,\nand it regulates sleepiness\nand feelings of sleepiness.\nIn fact, the, excuse me, orexin\nalso called hypocretin system,\nthe orexin hypocretin system\nis what's disrupted in narcolepsy.\nThat was the important\ndiscovery of my colleagues,\nEmmanuel Mignot and Seiji Nishino\nat Stanford some years ago,\nthey identified the\nbiological basis of narcolepsy\nand it's a disruption in the\nso orexin hypocretin system\nand Modafinil is one of the\nprimary treatments for narcolepsy.\nIt also has these other\neffects on the dopamine system\nand on the norepinephrine system,\neven though it doesn't lead\nto quite as intense levels\nof dopamine and arousal and focus,\nit does have the property of\nraising levels of attention\nand focus, and that's\nwhy people are using it.\nSo it's a somewhat\nmilder form of Adderall.\nArmodafinil for some people\nworks as well as Modafinil\nand as I mentioned before,\nit's much lower cost for\nother people it doesn't.\nI have an experience,\nmeaning I do have an experience\nthat I'll share with you with armodafinil.\nA few years ago,\nI was suffering from\njet lag, really terribly\nand I was traveling overseas.\nI went to a meeting to give a talk,\nI took half of the prescribed\ndose of armodafinil.\nIt was prescribed to me.\nI took that half dose\nand I gave my lecture\nand then I stayed around\nto answer questions\nand then four hours later,\na friend of mine came up to me and said,\nyou've been talking for\nfour and a half hours,\nand they're only a few people still here.\nLuckily there were still a\nfew people be a lot weirder,\nif the room was completely empty,\n'cause it wasn't being recorded.\nSo I have firsthand knowledge\nof the sorts of cognitive\neffects that it can create.\nI personally would not\nwant to be in that state\nfor sake of studying or learning\nor for doing this podcast, for instance\nand I can honestly say that today,\nall I've adjusted is some coffee\nand some Yerba latte tea and some water.\nI'm not on any of the compounds\nthat I've described during\nthe course of today's episode.\nYou might ask why I took\nhalf the recommended dose\nof armodafinil and the reason\nis that I'm somebody who's\nfairly hypersensitive to\nmedication of any kind,\nwhat you find if you\nlook in the literature,\nis that about 5% of people\nare hyper hyper sensitive to medication.\nThey require far lower\ndoses of any medication\nthan other people in order to\nexperience the same effects.\nI'm somebody that I think has,\nor modest a hyper if that\nsort of oxymoronic statement,\nbut a modest hypersensitivity\nto medication.\nSo I've almost always been able to get by,\non taking less of whatever\nwas prescribed for me\nand feel just fine\nor in this case to feel\nlike it was still too much,\nit turned out that the right\ndose of armodafinil for me\nwas zero milligrams.\nNow you may notice that\nI haven't talked much about acetylcholine.\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter\nthat at the neuron to muscle connections,\nthe so called neuromuscular junctions\nis involved in generating\nmuscular contractions\nof all kinds for all movements.\nAcetylcholine is also released\nfrom two sites in the brain.\nSo a little bit of\nnomenclature here again,\nfeel free to ignore the nomenclature,\nbut there is a collection of\nneurons in your brain stem\nthat send projections forward,\nkind of like a sprinkler system\nthat's very diffuse to\nrelease acetylcholine\nand those neurons reside\nin an area or a structure\nthat's called the\npedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN\nand then there's a separate\ncollection of neurons\nin the basal forebrain called\nunimaginatively nucleus\nbasalis the nucleus at the base\nand they also hose the\nbrain with acetylcholine,\nbut in a much more specific way.\nSo one is sort of like a sprinkler system\nand the other one is more like a fire hose\nto a particular location\nand those two sources of acetylcholine,\ncollaborate to activate\nparticular locations in the brain,\nand really bring about a\ntremendous degree of focus\nto whatever is happening at\nthose particular synapses.\nSo it could be a focus\non visual information\nor auditory information,\nif you're listening closely\nto what I'm saying right now,\nand you just heard closely\nstep out from the rest of my sentence,\nno doubt there was acetylcholine\nreleased at the sites in your brain\nwhere the neurons that\nrepresent your recognition\nof the word closely occurred, okay?\nSo now you have an example\nand you have an understanding\nand hopefully a picture in your mind\nof how all this is working,\nnot surprisingly then drugs\nthat increase cholinergic\nor acetycholine transmission\nwill increase focus and cognition.\nOne such compound is so-called alpha GPC,\nwhich is a form of choline\nand increases acetycholine\ntransmission dosages as high\nas 1200 milligrams per day,\nwhich has a very high dosage spread out,\ntypically it's 300 or\n400 milligrams spread out\nthroughout the day have\nbeen shown to offset\nsome of the effects of\nage-related cognitive decline,\nimproved cognitive functioning\npeople that don't have\nage-related cognitive decline\nthat's a very high dose.\nTypically when people are\nusing alpha-GPC to study\nor to enhance learning of any kind,\nthey will take somewhere\nbetween 300 and 600 milligrams\nthat's more typical.\nAgain, you have to check with your doctor,\nyou have to decide if the safety margins\nare appropriate for you\nobviously you'll want to check that out,\nbut alpha-GPC is effective in creating\nmore focused by way of\nthis cholinergic system,\nIt stimulates acetylcholine release\nfrom both of those locations,\nthe PPN in the back of the\nbrain and nucleus basalis\nin the front of the brain.\nThere are two other over\nthe counter compounds\nthat are in active use out\nthere for treatment of ADHD\nand in use for simply\ntrying to improve focus\nand the first one is L-Tyrosine\nit's an amino acid that\nacts as a precursor\nto the neuromodulator dopamine\nand now knowing everything you know about\ndopamine, attention and\nthe circuits involved,\nit should come as no surprise as to why\npeople are exploring the use\nof L-tyrosine for that purpose.\nL-tyrosine does lead to\nincreases in dopamine.\nThey are fairly long lived\nand L-tyrosine can improve\none's ability to focus, however,\nthe dosaging can be\nvery tricky to dial in.\nSometimes it makes\npeople feel too euphoric\nor too jittery or too\nalert that they are then\nunable to focus well.\nSo the dosage ranges are huge,\nyou see evidence for 100 milligrams\nall the way up to 1200 milligrams.\nIt's something that really\nshould be approached with caution,\nespecially for people that have any kind\nof underlying psychiatric\nor mood disorder,\nbecause dysregulation of\nthe dopamine system is\ncentral to many of the mood\ndisorders such as depression,\nbut also especially\nmania bipolar disorder,\nschizophrenia, things of that sort.\nSo it's something that\nreally should be approached\nwith caution, nonetheless,\nin exploring what's out there\nand even some studies online\nthat were done in either animal\nstudies or human studies,\nit's clear that L-tyrosine\nis being explored for that\npurpose as is PEA and Phenethylamine,\nwhich is a essentially PEA,\nbut some related compounds.\nSo there's a whole class of dopaminergic\nor dopamine stimulating supplements\nthat people are using to try\nand get their dopamine\nlevels up and again,\nit's kind of a fine line\nbetween too little enough\nand too much.\nIf you want to get the literature on\nthose two compounds\nthere, I will refer you to\nthis great website at\nexamine.com just as it sounds\nand you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA,\nand you can get the details on that.\nBut I highly recommend also\ngoing to their section on ADHD\nto see how those particular\ncomment OENs relate specifically\nto ADHD and cognitive focus.\nAnd last but not least\nin terms of these different compounds,\nI do want to mention the Racetams.\nThese are somewhat esoteric\nand probably most of you\nhaven't heard about them,\nbut some of you probably\nknow a lot about them\nand they are becoming more popular.\nThey go by names like New\npepped and things of that sort.\nThe Racetams. are illegal\nin certain countries.\nThey are gray market in other countries,\nand they are sold over the\ncounter in this country,\nin the U.S. so they have\ndifferent margins for safety\nyou definitely need to\nconsult your doctor,\nespecially if you have ADHD,\nbut new pepped has been shown when taken,\nat 10 milligrams, twice\ndaily can be more effective\nthan some of the other Racetams.\nWhat is Noopept? Noopept taps\ninto the cholinergic system,\nthe acetylcholine system in\nways, very similar to alpha-GPC,\nbut seems to have a slightly\nhigher affinity for some of the\nreceptors involved and can\nlead to those heightened states\nof cognitive capacity\nand there are these\nstudies one in particular,\ncomparative studies of new pepped,\nRacetams in the treatment of patients\nwith mild cognitive disorders\nand brain diseases of\nvascular and traumatic origin.\nThat's a mouthful.\nWhat this study basically points to\nis the fact that people who\nare experiencing some degree\nof inability to focus\ndue to prior concussion\nor some vascular event, a\nstroke or a schemey of any kind,\nbecause neurons need blood,\nwhen the blood supply\nis cut off to neurons,\nor when there's a bleed in the brain.\nSubsequent to that, often\nthere are challenges in maintaining focus.\nThis is very common for\npeople who have done sports,\nwhere there's a lot of\nrunning into each other\nwith your head like rugby\nfootball, hockey, and so forth,\nbut also people who have\nexperienced head blows\nor often overlooked is the fact that\nmost traumatic head injury\nis not actually from sports,\neven football it's from\nthings like construction work\nfrom high-impact work of that kind.\nSo there does seem to be some efficacy\nof new Pepped and Racetams.\nand things like it.\nIt's an emerging area and\nas I mentioned in the U.S.\nthese things are sold over the counter.\nAgain, you have to figure\nout if it's right for you,\nbut they are beginning\nto show some promise,\nand I'm intrigued by\nthem because of the way\nthat they tap into the cholinergic system,\nwhich is both directly involved in focus,\nand the ability to focus,\nbut is also important for things related\nto age-related cognitive decline.\nSo a decline in cholinergic\ntransmission or acetylcholine\nas we call it in the\nbrain is one of the things\nassociated with cognitive decline\nand it does seem that increasing\ncholinergic transmission\ncan offset some of that cognitive decline\nand perhaps even more so in conditions\nsuch as vascular damage or\nconcussion to the brain.\nIf you're interested in\natypical treatments for ADHD\ncompounds or improve\nfocus and related themes,\nand you like reading about this stuff,\nthere's an excellent review article\nthat I can refer you to it's\nby Ahn et al, AHN it was published in 2016\nso it's a little bit behind the times,\nalthough it's surprisingly\ncomprehensive given that,\nwhich lines up all the various\ndrugs that I've discussed,\nRacetams., and Adderall and Ritalin,\nand various forms of dopaminergic agents\nand cholinergic agents\nspells out whether or not\nthey are sold over the\ncounter by prescription,\nand really lines them\nup in all their effects,\ntheir drawbacks, et cetera.\nI'll refer you to that study.\nIt's available in its full\nlength form online for free\nit's Hen et al the journal\nis neuro plasticity,\nneural plasticity, 2016\nshould be very easy to find\nif you put those keywords in,\nand while it is a review,\nit is a very comprehensive review\nand if you're really into this stuff,\nand you also want to\nlearn a thing or two about\nhow these things interact\nwith neurofeedback, et cetera,\nthere's some information in there as well.\nI know I've already covered\na lot of information,\nbut there is one more\ncategory of technology\nfor the treatment of ADHD\nand for enhancement of focus\nin anyone that I would like to emphasize\nand that's transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation.\nTranscranial magnetic\nstimulation also called TMS\nis achieving increasing\npopularity nowadays\nfor the treatment of all\nsorts of neurologic conditions\nand psychiatric conditions.\nIt is a non-invasive tool,\nit involves taking a coil\nit's a device with a coil\nthat's placed over particular\nlocations in the brain,\nand then sends magnetic\nstimulation into the brain\nand it can actually pass through the skull\nwithout having to drill through the skull\nand nowadays can be used to both\nlower the amount of activity\nor increase the amount of activity\nin specific brain areas.\nIt's spatial, precision is not remarkable.\nThat doesn't mean it's not of use,\nbut it is not a super\nfine green tool, okay?\nIt's not a canon, but\nit's also not a needle.\nIt is somewhere in between.\nIt can direct the activity\nof particular brain regions\nat particular depths and as I mentioned,\nit can increase or decrease that activity.\nSo for instance,\nI've had a TMS coil placed on my head,\nnot for therapeutic purposes, even it was,\nI wouldn't tell you, but rather just for,\nwell, I'm a neuroscientist\nand I worked in a lab with\none for entertainment,\nexploratory purposes, please\ndon't do this at home.\nIt was placed over my motor cortex,\nwhich generates voluntary action\nand it was a coil that at that time\ncould only inhibit neurons\nand so what I was doing\nas I was moving objects\naround on a table, just like I am now,\nit was actually a pencil, not a pen\nand I was tapping the pencil\nand then the TMS coil was turned\non and for the life of me,\nI could not move that pencil, okay?\nBecause it was inhibiting\nmy upper motor neurons\nin the portion of my cortex\nthat controls voluntary activity.\nAs soon as the coil was turned off,\nI could return to\ntapping the pencil again,\nnowadays it's possible\nto stimulate motor cortex\nor any area of the brain\nwith some degree of precision\nthat could create the impulse to move\nwithout actually making\nthe decision to move.\nSo you can literally engage\ncertain neural circuits\nand therefore behaviors\nand certain thought\nand emotional patterns\nby way of transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation.\nThis has far reaching\nand vast implications,\nas you can probably imagine\nin discussing ADHD with a\ncolleague that uses TMS,\nwhat they are doing is they\nare taking the TMS coil\nto children and adults that have ADHD,\nand they're using it to\nstimulate the portions\nof the prefrontal cortex\nthat we talked about earlier\nthat engage task directed focused states.\nSo rather than using a drug\nthat generally increases dopamine,\nand some of the other chemicals involved\nthere you using directed TMS\nstimulation of the circuits\nand fortunately, I was\nquite relieved to hear this,\nthey are combining that with\na focused learning task.\nSo they're literally\nteaching the brain to learn\nin a noninvasive way, no drug at all\nand right now there are\nexperiments clinical trials\ngoing on, comparing TMS of this sort\nto the drug treatments of the\nsort that we described earlier\nthat engaged these circuits\nthrough pharmacologic mechanisms.\nSo very exciting times for TMS,\nvery exciting times for\npharmacology related to ADHD\nand for enhancing focus in general\nand when I say very exciting times,\nI mean, no drug is perfect,\nbut the constellation of\ndrugs that's out there\nis getting much larger,\nbut because they tap\ninto different aspects\nof their circuitry,\nI do think that we are well on our way\nto identifying the ideal\ncombinations of drug treatments,\ntechnological treatments,\nand behavioral paradigms\nfor increasing focus in both\nchildren and adults with ADHD.\nAnd as a final final point,\nI also want to mention\nsomething about technologies\nthat are making it harder\nfor all of us to focus,\nregardless of whether or not\nwe have pre-existing ADHD or not.\nYou can probably guess\nwhere this is going.\nEverybody nowadays seems\nto have a smartphone.\nI'm sure there are a few\nindividuals out there\nthat don't have a smartphone.\nNonetheless, most people have them.\nMost kids want one, as\nsoon as they can get them\nand they are small, they\ngrab our attention entirely.\nBut within that small box of attention,\nthere are millions of attentional windows\nscrolling by, right?\nSo just because it's one\ndevice that we look at\ndoes not mean that we are focused,\nwe are focused on our phone,\nbut because of the way,\nin which context switches\nup so fast within the phone,\nit's thought that the\nbrain is struggling now\nto leave that rapid\nturnover of context, right?\nMany, many shows, many,\nmany Instagram pages,\nmany, many Twitter feeds\nmany, many websites.\nBasically the whole world,\nat least in virtual format is available\nwithin that small box.\nUnlike any other technology\nhumans have ever dealt with before,\neven though there are trillions\ninfinite number of bits of information\nin the actual physical world,\nyour attentional window,\nthat aperture of constriction\nand dilating that visual window\nis the way in which you cope with all that\noverwhelming information typically.\nWell within the phone,\nyour visual aperture\nis set to a given width\nit's about this big,\ntypically the phone seem\nto be getting bigger,\nbut nonetheless, it's about that big\nand within there,\nyour attentional window is\ngrabbing it near infinite\nnumber of bits of\ninformation, colors, movies.\nIf a picture is worth 1000 words,\na movie is worth a billion pictures,\nthe brain loves visual motion\nand so the question is,\ndoes that sort of interaction\non a regular basis\nlead to deficits in the types of attention\nthat we need in order to perform well\nin work, in school,\nrelationships, et cetera\nand the short answer is\nyes, it does appear so\nwe are inducing a sort of ADHD\nand while the studies on this\nare ongoing because prominent\nuse of smartphones really\ntook off right around 2010\nand we're only in 2021\nlongstanding studies take time,\nwhich is essentially to say the\nsame thing as long standing.\nThere are some studies\nand one in particular\nthat I'd like to highlight\none was actually carried\nout pretty early in 2014.\nThis is a study that\nexplored smartphone use\nat the time they called\nit mobile phone use,\nbut smartphone use and inattention,\ndifficulties in attending\nin 7,102 adolescents\nthat's a huge study,\na population based cross-sectional study\nand you will be probably\nsurprised and somewhat dismayed\nto hear that in order\nto avoid this decrease\nin attentional capacity,\nadolescents needed to use their smartphone\nfor less than 60 minutes per day,\nin order to stay focused and\ncentered on their other tasks.\nOtherwise they started to really run\ninto significant issues.\nSo 60 minutes is not much,\nI've a feeling that most young people\nare using their phone more\nthan 60 minutes per day,\nI know I am.\nI think for adults,\nthe number's probably higher\nmeaning if you're an adult,\nI'm going to just extrapolate\nfrom what I read in this study.\nIt seems that probably two\nhours a day on the phone\nwould be the upper limit beyond which\nyou would probably experience\npretty severe attentional deficits.\nI'm a big fan of Cal Newport\nwho wrote the book \"Deep work.\"\nHe's also written an excellent book,\n\"A world without Email.\"\nI've never met him, but I'm\na huge admirer of his work\nand I will paraphrase\nsomething that he said\nfar more eloquently than I ever could,\nwhich is that the brain does\nnot do well with constant\ncontext switching, meaning it can do it,\nbut it diminishes our\ncapacity to do meaningful work\nof any other kind.\nAnd so Cal, as I understand is very\nhe's our computer science professor\nat Georgetown, by the way,\nis very structured and very disciplined\nin his avoidance of cell phone use.\nI think we're all striving to do that.\nI'm not here to tell you what to do,\nbut I think whether or\nnot you have ADHD or not,\nif you're an adolescent\nlimiting your smartphone use\nto 60 minutes per day or less\nand if you are an adult to\ntwo hours per day or less\nis going to be among the\nvery best ways to maintain,\njust to maintain your ability to focus\nat whatever level you can\nnow and as I always say,\nmost of the things that we get recognized\nfor in life success in\nlife, in every endeavor,\nwhether or not it's school\nrelationships, sport,\ncreative works of any kind\nare always proportional\nto the amount of focus that\nwe can bring that activity.\nIt is important to rest of\ncourse, to get proper sleep.\nBut I stand behind that statement\nand I leave you with that\nstudy about attention\nand cell phones and how cell\nphones are indeed eroding\nour attentional capacities.\nSo I realized I covered a\nlot of information about ADHD\nand the biology of focus and\nhow to get better at focusing.\nWe talked about the behavioral\nand psychological phenotypes of ADHD.\nWe talked about the\nunderlying neural circuitry.\nWe also talked about the neurochemistry\nand we talked about the\nvarious prescription\ndrug treatments that are\naimed at that neurochemistry\nand aimed at increasing focus in children\nand adults with ADHD.\nWe also talked about over\nthe counter compounds,\nthe role of particular types\nof diets and elimination diets\nand we talked about interactions\nbetween these various\nfeatures in dictating outcomes for ADHD\nand enhancing focus in general,\nwe also talked a little bit\nabout emerging neurotechnologies\nand how certain technologies\nlike the smartphone\nare no doubt hindering\nour ability to focus\nand put us at greater risk of\ndeveloping ADHD at all ages.\nI do acknowledge the irony\nand somewhat the contradiction\nof doing a two hour plus episode on ADHD\nIf indeed, people who are watching this\nhave challenges with attention,\nI want to emphasize that this podcast,\nlike all of our podcast episodes\nare timestamped for a specific reason.\nThey are designed to be digested\nin whatever batch one chooses, right?\nYou don't have to watch or\nlisten to the entire thing\nall at once however,\nif you've gotten to this\npoint in the podcast,\nI want to thank you.\nI do hope that you've learned\na lot about this condition.\nI hope you've also learned a lot\nabout your own capacity to focus\nand things that you can\ndo to enhance your focus.\nWe even talked about\na tool that takes just\none 17 minute session to\nenhance your ability to focus\nthereafter, presumably forever.\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\nand you're learning from it,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel\nthat really helps
