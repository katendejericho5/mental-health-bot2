answering your\nquestions the first question is about\nscheduling Fitness that is how to ensure\nthat you get sufficient number of\nresistance training and cardiovascular\nworkouts per week in order to best\nbenefit your immediate and long-term\nHealth now I did episode of The hubin\nLab podcast all about what I call a\nfoundational Fitness protocol the\nfoundational Fitness protocol is the one\nthat I've followed more or less for the\nlast 30 plus years and it certainly is\nnot the only protocol that works out\nthere but it's a schedule that most\npeople can adhere to over time and that\nchecks off the boxes for what the\ncurrent research tells us we need in\norder to maximize our cardiovascular\nhealth to maximize our neuromuscular\nhealth and to do so with a minimal time\ncommitment now I've already put together\nand I provide a link in the show note\ncaptions for the foundational Fitness\nprotocol in the form of a PDF which\nspells out which workouts are done on\nwhich days what the various workouts\nlook like including sets and Reps what\noptions you have in terms of\ncardiovascular exercise I personally\nlike to run but you could also use a\nrower you can use a stationary bike\nthere's a lot of optionality inside of\nthe foundational Fitness protocol and by\nthe way the foundational Fitness\nprotocol is available to all of you\ncompletely zero cost you don't even need\nto sign up for our neural network\nnewsletter although you can if you like\nand again you can find that by following\na link in the show note captions or\nsimply going to hubman lab.com going to\nthe menu tab scrolling down to\nnewsletter and then you can scroll down\nto the foundational Fitness protocol you\ncan view it online print it out again\ndoesn't cost anything and there's no\nbarrier to entry meaning you don't need\nto do anything to access it you can just\nlook at it or download it or print it\nwhatever you like the basic structure of\nthe foundational Fitness protocol is\nthree resistance training sessions per\nweek and three cardiovascular training\nsessions per week and then one complete\nrest day now that might sound like a lot\nto some of you but in fact none of the\nworkouts is particularly long I think\nthe longest workout in that entire\nfoundational Fitness protocol is about\n60 minutes maybe 75 minutes if you're\nmoving slowly through the gym because\nsomebody else is in the way or because\nyou're you know checking your phone a\nlittle too often as we all sometimes do\nthat sort of thing but the basic\nstructure is as follows for me the\nfoundational Fitness protocol starts as\nday one on Monday but you could start it\nas day one on any day of the week\nfrankly so day one for me is to train\nlegs so that's quadriceps hamstrings and\ncalves and tibialis work the front of\nthe shin uh for those of you that uh\ndon't know I'm a big fan of doing\ntibialis work then the next day is a\ncomplete day off during which you could\ndo if you wanted something like\ndeliberate heat or deliberate cold\nexposure or both but you don't have to\nit's just nice to have a complete day\noff after training legs because if you\ntrain legs properly often times it can\nbe a bit tiring and the next day you're\nrecovering then the following day is\neither a cardiovascular training session\nof about 20 to 30 minutes of say a jog\nat a slightly more rapid clip than one\nwould consider Zone 2 cardio Zone 2\ncardio is where you can carry out a\nconversation so a little bit faster than\nthat or if you're not feeling like your\nlegs are recovered enough to do that you\ncould do the resistance training work on\nthat day the resistance training work\nthat falls in the middle of the week is\nBelieve It or Not torso I know that's\nfor some of you that are into more kind\nof bodybuilding type routines training\nyour entire torso on one day might seem\nlike a lot but really that day just\ninvolves some pushing so some overhead\nshoulder press type workouts or dips\nmaybe some bench presses if that's your\nthing as well as some pulling so some\nrows and some pull-ups or chin-ups\nthings of that sort again all tailored\nto you so that you're not doing anything\nthat aggravates any pre-existing\ninjuries and you're not going to do\nanything that's going to induce injuries\nokay so there's some pushing and pulling\nmaybe a little bit of neck work if you\nneed some additional neck strength that\nsort of thing so with legs on Monday\nrest on Tuesday that falls either on\nWednesday or Thursday depending on how\nrecovered your legs were then the next\nday which for me typically falls on a\nFriday is a high-intensity interval\ntraining session although really it's\njust about VO2 max it's about getting\nmaximum heart rate where you're\nbreathing really really hard and that's\na very short workout the total duration\nof that workout is anywhere from 8 to 15\nminutes total so for me it involves\ngetting on an airdine bike those are\nthose bikes with some resistance cuz\nthere's a fan although you could do this\non a row or basically anything where you\ncan exert yourself to get your heart\nrate way way up and breathe very very\nhard where not going to injure your\nmuscular skeletal system you're not\ngoing to do any soft tissue damage so\nyou need to figure out what that is for\nyou again the PDF explains how to select\nthat for me it typically means getting\non the airdine bike and pedaling very\nhard for about 20 seconds then resting\n10 seconds 20 seconds hard 10 seconds\nrest 20 seconds hard for a total of\nabout eight Cycles by the end of which\nI'm breathing extremely hard my heart\nrate is way way up and then I'll just\nshower and head about my day and then\nthe following day which typically for me\nfalls on a Saturday although again we're\ngoing to talk about flexibility and how\nto build flexibility into the schedule\nthe Saturday workout is typically things\nlike biceps triceps some calves maybe a\nbit more neck work and some abdominal\nwork excuse me so basically small body\nparts that can recover pretty quickly\nand that workout typically takes only\nabout 45 to 50 minutes maybe 60 minutes\nmaximum and then the following day which\nis of course Sunday is a day in which I\ntry and get outside and move as much as\npossible so I'll typically do the longer\nSunday cardio workout as either a rock\nso a backpack with a weight in it by the\nway if you don't own a ruck sack you can\njust put a you know a gallon water a jug\nin there full and then you know drink it\nas you go it'll lighten as you go or you\ncould get a weight vest if you have the\nresources to do that there's some great\nweight vests out there um a varying\nweight uh you can uh throw a kid on your\nshoulders if you got a kid that wants to\nbe carried on your shoulders um you can\ndo it alone listening to an Audi book\nlistening to music or in total silence\nI've done all these various versions by\nthe way you can do it with family\nmembers or with friends I'll sometimes\ndo this with my significant other one of\nthe great things about this long Sunday\nworkout is that it's extremely flexible\nin terms of how social you are or uh\nwhether or not you do it in isolation\nwhether or not you do it on concrete or\non dirt it's very versatile for instance\nif I have friends over and I want to\nspend time with them but I also want to\nget outdoors and do this workout and if\nthey're interested in getting some\noutdoor movement as well we'll all just\nhead out for a hike and if they are less\nfit than I am or intend to move more\nslowly well then I'll throw on a you\nknow a 10 or 15 maybe even 30 lb um\nbackpack so that I get a good workout\nout of it and if they're faster than I\nam and they're the sort of person who\nyou know is a triathlete I've got some\nfriends who are triathletes and they\nwant to move at a really fast clip well\nthen I'm not bringing any weight pack\nand I'm just going to ask them to you\nknow uh wait up for me because I'm going\nto have a hard time keeping up but I'll\nhave to really push myself as I go along\nso a lot of Versatility I don't measure\nmy heart rate during any of these\nworkouts by the way that's not my\npreferred way to do things I know other\npeople like to measure heart rate as\nthey go I find it's just really nice to\nget out once a week if possible out ofd\ndoors and just move my body as much as\npossible so that I head into the week\nknowing that I got some really terrific\noutdoor time in nature while benefiting\nmy cardiovascular system and often while\nsocializing with important people in my\nlife as well okay so that's the summary\nof the foundational Fitness protocol and\none thing that I really like about it is\nthat the total time commitment is\nactually not that great if you step back\nfrom it you realize there's you know a\nbrief 12-minute workout there's an\nhourong weight training workout there's\na long hike sure but then there's a\n20-minute jog it's really not that much\ntime when you consider the overall\nbenefits to one's Health now one very\nimportant feature of the foundational\nFitness protocol is to build some\nflexibility into it you know the way I\ndescribed it up until now was okay\nMonday legs Tuesday rest Wednesday\ncardio Thursday torso Friday\nhigh-intensity interval training VO2 max\nSaturday small body parts biceps triceps\ncalves Etc Sunday long slow distance\ncardio but in reality sometimes I have\nto travel on a Monday so I don't have\nthe option to train legs that day in\nwhich case what I will do is either\nslide that workout to\nSunday meaning I'm doing both long slow\ndistance cardio and the leg workout or\nI'll slide it to Tuesday which is\ntypically a rest day however sometimes\nI'm traveling on a Monday I don't have\naccess to a gym to train my legs\nproperly so what do I do do I skip leg\nday no I don't skip leg day typically\nunless I'm sick or I'm extremely sleep\ndeprived or there's some other major\nstress in my life what I'll typically do\nis I will plan for it by training my\nlegs on Sunday or if I don't have access\nto a place where I can train my legs\nproperly on Sunday I'll just shift it to\nTuesday okay now the question always\nbecomes if I were to move that leg\nworkout to Sunday just by way of\nnecessity because I'm traveling on a\nMonday do I also do the long slow\ndistance work that I typically do on\nSunday and the answer is yes if I'm well\nrested so if I'm well rested and well\nfed I'm not feeling like I'm fighting\noff any kind of illness and I have the\ntime what I'll do is I'll train my legs\nin the gym on Sunday and then I'll head\nout for I don't know an hourlong walk in\nthe neighborhood or something like that\nso I'm probably not training my legs\nhard and then going hiking hard all day\nalthough I've done that before but then\nI'm sure to rest completely the next day\nwhich is Monday now what if I move the\nleg workout to Tuesday do then I take\nWednesday off completely\nwell for me the way I train legs is\ntypically with a lot of intensity so if\nI'm going to train legs typically the\nnext day will be a complete day off no\nmatter what but that's not always the\ncase I think as long as you're not\nmoving your workouts around constantly\nit's perfectly fine to train your legs\nreally hard on a Tuesday because you\nhave to because you couldn't train them\non Monday and then on Wednesday rather\nthan go out for a jog I might train\ntorso and I might back off on the\nintensity a little bit and then I'll\ntake a day off I will say that anytime I\ndo resistance training workouts two days\nin a row I make sure that I take a\ncomplete day off the following third day\njust for sake of recovery I'm not\nsomebody that recovers particularly well\nfrom any form of exercise I find that if\nI train longer than 90 minutes\nespecially with resistance training if I\ncrank up the intensity too much I tend\nto get sick or I tend to stop making\nprogress with my resistance training\nsessions so the basic takeaway here is\nit's perfectly fine to slide a\nresistance training session such as legs\nforward a day or back a day okay so I\nguess back a day would be from Monday to\nSunday or forward from Monday to Tuesday\nbut then you're going to want to make\nsome adjustments accordingly so that you\ndon't get sick or you don't overtrain\nand that sort of thing now let's say\nthat I train my legs on Tuesday then I\ndo torso work on Wednesday and then I\ntake the next day completely off so I\ntake Thursday completely off well then\nFriday rolls around and I haven't done\nany cardiovascular training that week\nexcept for the walk that I did on Sunday\nwhat am I going to do do I do my V2 Max\nand a 30-minute jog sure that's what I\nwould do I would combine the two\ncardiovascular workouts that I normally\ndo in the middle of the week by for\ninstance going out for a 20 or 30 minute\nJog and then at the end doing some V2\nMax work such that by the end of Friday\nI'm caught up with that cardiovascular\ntraining and then on Saturday I would\njust go right ahead and do those small\nbody parts training and then on Sunday I\nwould take a hike and that sort of thing\nso basically what I'm saying is the\nfoundation Fitness protocol provides a\nscaffold of Ideal what you would do if\nyou had a completely non-negotiable\nmindset where you said okay Monday's\nalways legs Wednesday is always this\nThursday is always that so basically\nwhat I'm describing is trying to achieve\noptimal right training certain things on\ncertain days doing certain things in\ncertain ways that wasn't meant to rhyme\nby the way but the reality is we all\nhave travel we all get run down we all\nhave lack of sleep at times we have\nstressful episodes in life so for me the\nbest solution to that is to basically\nallow any one workout either resistance\ntraining or cardiovascular workout to\nslide back or forward by one day which\nmeans sometimes doubling up on workouts\nfor a given day to make sure that I\ncheck off those boxes of getting three\nresistance training sessions per week\nand three cardiovascular training\nsessions per week again for the\ncardiovascular training sessions it's a\nlong slow distance it's a moderate 20 a\n30 minute cardiovascular training\nsession and then it's that shorter VO2\nmax cardiovascular training s and\nsometimes doubling those up on the same\nday so that I make sure that by the end\nof the week I've achieved what I want to\nachieve which is I've trained my legs\nI've trained my torso I've trained my\narms any small body parts that need\nadditional work for balance or\nstabilization or aesthetic reasons you\nget that in but also that you get the\nbase of the long slow distance endurance\nyou get the slightly more intense or\nrather faster cardiovascular training\nsession and then you get your heart rate\nup up up at least once per week doing\nthat high-intensity interval training\nnow as I describ this I realized that I\nmight be taking what a few minutes ago\nwas fairly simple in design and making\nit more complex why well some people\nfeel that as soon as you introduce\nflexibility into a schedule you remove\nof course the non-negotiable aspect of\nit and then people get really confused\nare they overtraining are they under\ntrining is it okay for instance if you\ncan't train Monday Tuesday Wednesday to\nthen just train Thursday Friday Saturday\nSunday I think everybody is an\nindividual everybody needs to modify\ntheir schedule Accord according to the\ndemands on their life and their\nparticular Fitness needs but I will say\nthis I've found having tried many many\ndifferent Fitness schedules many many\ndifferent combinations of resistance\ntraining and cardiovascular training\nthat the best solution is to find what\nyou can do on a consistent basis and to\ntry and do that as many days and weeks\nof the year as possible with the\nunderstanding that sometimes you're\nsimply not going to be able to meet that\nschedule which is why you allow for this\nsliding back and forward of individual\nworkouts doubling occasionally two\nworkouts per day in order to stay on\nschedule but and this is very important\nalso allowing yourself to sometimes just\nskip a training day yes I said it so\nsometimes just skip a training day\nyou're feeling a little rundown it's\nlate in the day you don't want to drink\ncaffeine to train because then it's\ngoing to throw off your sleep well I'm\nthe first person to say you know Skip\ntorso training day and then maybe on\nsmall body parts day which for me falls\non Saturday instead of just doing biceps\ntriceps with some isolation exercises\nmake sure you do a few chins pull-ups\ndips and things like that to make sure\nthat you hit those torso muscles as well\nskipping a workout every once in a while\nis not going to Crater your entire\nfitness program it's simply not that\nsaid for sake of physical health and for\nsake of just feeling good about your\ncommitment and follow-through to your\nfitness regimen you should try on\naverage to make somewhere between 85 and\n95% of your workouts and if you schedule\nthings well and in particular if you\nleave your phone out of the gym uh if\nyou're able to do that I know sometimes\nwe need the phone to communicate with\npeople or the potential to communicate\nwith people if people need to get a hold\nof us but if you can leave your phone\noutside of the gym you'll be amazed at\nhow quickly you move through these\nworkouts likewise with your\ncardiovascular training sessions now one\nimportant feature of flexibility that I\nhaven't talked about yet is flexibility\nwithin a day so for me just personally\nagain this is my personal preference\nthis is by no means Dogma I prefer to\nget my workouts done first thing in the\nmorning so I like to get up hydrate get\nsome electrolytes in my system get some\ncaffeine in my system if I'm going to\nwork out that's right I said it I do\nbelieve if you experience a crash in\nenergy in the afternoon delaying your\ncaffeine by about 90 minutes or so after\nwaking could be very beneficial I know\nthere's some controversy around that but\nalmost everybody that tries it finds\nthat that's the case again no obligation\nto do that it's just a suggestion to you\nknow perhaps experiment with if you have\nan afternoon crash but for me and I\nthink for most people if you're going to\nworkout first thing in the morning and\nyou like caffeine before a workout drink\ncaffeine for first thing in the morning\nthat's certainly what I do if I'm going\nto work out that day I like to have my\nworkouts done before 9:00 a.m. and\nideally before 8:30 a.m. so that I can\nmove into my workday however there are\ndays where that simply doesn't happen\nand then the question is is it okay to\nmove a workout from its typical time\nlike for me 7:30 a.m. or so to the\nafternoon and the answer is yes there's\nsimply no reason why that's not okay\nit's not going to cause a significant\ndiminishment in performance if anything\nthat data point to the fact that for\nsake of physical performance and output\nworkouts in the afternoon are probably\nmore beneficial I don't know about that\nresult I mean that's certainly what the\ndata say I know for me I'm most alert\nand have the most amount of energy first\nthing in the morning and so that's when\nmy workouts tend to be best but if I\ncan't make a workout in the morning I'll\nsometimes do it in the afternoon around\n2:00 or 3 p.m. making sure however that\nI don't consume so much caffeine before\nthat workout that it's going to disrupt\nmy sleep now there's another feature of\ntraining which is like sunlight like\nmeals like\nsocialization physical exercise provides\nan entrainment mechanism that is a\npredictive mechanism for your so-called\nautonomic nervous system that makes it\nsuch that at a given hour of the day\nthat you normally train so for me around\n7:30 a.m. or so you'll notice that\nthere's going to be a peak in physical\nand mental energy that's right if you\nwork out at a given time pretty\nconsistently your autonomic nervous\nsystem will start to anticipate that\ntiming and you'll start to feel an\nincrease in energy around that time that\nis not an imagined thing it's a real\nthing it's a short-term entrainment as\nwe call it this is something that I'll\nprobably visit in a future full length\nepisode of The hubman Lab podcast but\nwhat you'll notice is that around the\ntime that you normally train or run or\nwhatever you want to call it you start\nto feel an increase in energy and you\ncan leverage that by going ahead and\ntraining but if you don't have the\nopportunity to train then I do think\nit's a good idea to still get that\ntraining session in at a later time\nduring the day if you have the\nopportunity otherwise you may have to\nslide it to uh the day before or the day\nafter as we talked about a few minutes\nago or you may have to skip entirely the\npoint here is that it's always going to\nbe best to complete the workout if you\ncan complete the workout safely and\nwithout disrupting your nighttime sleep\nI think that's really the biggest\ntakeaway I personally am not going to\ncompromise sleep and my overall health\nin order to get workouts in every once\nin a while I'll force myself to wake up\nespecially early meaning I'll cash out a\ncouple hours of sleep that I would\nnormally get so I normally get up around\nI don't know 6:00 a.m. or 6:30 kind of\ndepends on when I went to sleep but\nsometimes I'll give up 2 hours as sleep\nto get a workout in in the morning if\nI'm going to fly that day I will\nsometimes do that however if I'm very\nfatigued if I've been exposed to colds\nand flu I'm feeling kind of rundown then\nI won't do that I'll prioritize sleep\nmost of the time I prioritize sleep but\nthere are those occasions in which I'll\nprioritize the workout each and all of\nus have those options and my suggestion\nis to really look at things on a Case by\ncase meaning you as an individual and on\na daily basis taking into account what\nhappened the day before how stressed you\nare how much sleep you're getting how\nmuch Expos exposure to colds and flu and\nto pay attention to how hard you've been\ntraining recently you know if you're on\na family vacation and you want more time\nwith family are you really going to\ncompromise time with family in order to\nget your workouts in I think that would\nbe probably a bad idea you know if I'm\nhonest I think um you want to prioritize\nsocial life that's super important but\nthen of course you don't want to\nprioritize social life to the detriment\nof your physical health so it's all a\nbit of give and take and what I've tried\nto describe here is again a recap of the\nfoundational Fitness protocol the places\nwhere there's some flexibility you can\nmove workouts back a day or forward a\nday if you like you could double up if\nyou like especially if you're getting\ngreat rest and you're well fed Etc and\nyou can also move the workout up or down\nin the day depending on how much energy\nyou have how much sleep you've gotten\nand of course how you know rigid you are\nwith yourself some people are just\nreally rigid they are completely in the\nnon-negotiable stance they get their\nworkout in no matter what because they\nfeel as if they don't then they're going\nto be grumpy or they're going to fall\noff schedule other people like me try to\nget the workouts done I would say\nanywhere from 85 to 95% of the time I\nget those workouts done occasionally I\nskip them typically because life stress\ntravel or some sort of low-grade um\nillness you know a cold or a flu or\nsomething of that sort I get those\npretty rarely but they do happen so\nthat's really how I answer this question\nof how to build flexibility into one's\nfitness schedule I should also mention\nthat I'm a big believer in periodization\nso I will do four-month blocks of\ntraining heavier with the weights so\nthat's in the 3 to 5 repetition range\nthen another 3 to four month block will\nfollow where I'm training slightly less\nheavy so I'll typically be using\nanywhere from 5 to 8 repetition range\nand then for the next four month block\nI'll be using somewhere between 8 and 15\nrepetition range every once in a while\nI'll mix it up so that you know if I've\nbeen training heavy a lot I might do a\nlighter workout or if I've been training\nlighter I might do a heavy workout again\nnot super rigid I personally find that\nby being strict and rigid about the\nscheduling about the Reps and the sets\netc for most of the time meaning about\n85 to 95% of workouts and across the\nyear that things just work out great\nyou'll make constant progress without\nhaving to drive yourself and everybody\nelse crazy with uh extreme rigidity and\ncompulsivity around training and then of\ncourse you can enjoy those days off you\ncan enjoy the flexibility in your\nschedule because yes physical fitness is\nwonderful but unless you're an athlete\nespecially a professional athlete really\nphysical fitness is about being able to\nlean into other aspects of life with\nmore Vigor at least that's what it's\nabout for me and I think that's what\nit's about for most people thank you for\njoining for the beginning of this ask me\nanything episode to hear the full\nepisode and to hear future episodes of\nthese ask me anything
