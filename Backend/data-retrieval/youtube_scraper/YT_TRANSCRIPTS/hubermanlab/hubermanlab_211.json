    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nThis month, we're talking all\nabout disorders of the mind,\nthings like depression,\nattention deficit disorders,\neating disorders, schizophrenia,\nand bipolar disorder.\nDuring the course of this month,\nwe are going to discuss the psychological\nand biological underpinnings\nof mood disorders of all kinds.\nYou'll learn a lot of science.\nYou'll also learn a lot\nabout the various treatments\nthat exist and that are in development\nfor these various mood disorders.\nWe will talk about behavioral\ntools, things like exercise,\nmeditation, breath work,\nbut also prescription drugs,\nsupplements and novel compounds\nthat are now being tested\nin various clinical trials.\nAcross the month, I think\nyou'll start to realize\nthat there are common pathways\nunderlying many mood disorders.\nIn fact, mood disorders\nthat look quite different\nfrom one another often\ndepend on the action\nof the same neurochemicals\nor neural circuits\nin the brain and body.\nThat actually should be\na point of great relief\nbecause what it means is that\nby understanding the biology\nof one mood disorder or\nunderstanding how one treatment\nor behavioral intervention\ncan impact a mood disorder,\nwe gain insight into other\nmood disorders as well.\nAs always, we will discuss\nscience and science related tools\nthat people could implement\nshould they choose.\nBefore we dive into today's topic,\nI'd like to discuss a very particular\nset of scientific findings\nthat relate to today's topic,\nand that are important for\nunderstanding all mood disorders\nand all states of motivation,\nhappiness, and sadness,\nas well as depression.\nBasically, I'm going to\nparaphrase a brief segment\nof my discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,\nwho I sat down with to discuss addiction\nand the biological basis of addiction\nand addiction treatment.\nA very important aspect of that discussion\nwas when Dr. Lembke described\nthe pleasure pain balance,\nliterally the circuits in our brains\nthat control our sense\nof pleasure and pain,\nand ultimately whether\nor not we remain happy\nin our pursuit of pleasure or not.\nThis is an absolutely crucial aspect\nto the way that we\nfunction in everyday life,\nand especially under\nconditions of mood disorders.\nThe pathway that she was describing\nis the so-called pleasure system.\nHowever, what most people don't realize\nis that the pleasure system\nis also directly associated with,\nand in fact is the very same system\nthat modulates mental or\npsychological anguish and pain.\nEssentially what she described\nis that whenever we pursue something\nthat we think will bring us pleasure,\nand that could be anything that we think\nwill bring us pleasure from\nfood, to video games, to sex,\nto a particular job or goal,\nshort-term or long-term,\nthat we experience release of\nthe neuromodulator dopamine.\nNow, dopamine is associated\nwith increased levels\nof motivation and drive.\nIt is not the molecule of reward,\nit is the molecule of\ncraving motivation and drive.\nHowever, as Dr. Lembke pointed out,\nwhen we are in pursuit of something,\nthere is a release of\ndopamine in our brain\nthat makes us feel motivated,\nand in general, it makes us feel good.\nBut very shortly thereafter\nand beneath our conscious awareness,\nthere is a tilt of the pleasure\npain balance in the brain,\nliterally a shift in the neural circuits\nthat underlie pleasure and pain,\nsuch that every bit of\npleasure or pleasure seeking\nthat causes release of dopamine\nwill be balanced out by\na little bit of pain.\nAnd we don't experience\nthis as physical pain,\nat least not at first,\nwe experience it as craving for more\nof the thing that brought us pleasure.\nNow, that sounds pretty good.\nYou get pleasure and then\nyou get a little bit of pain\nto balance it out.\nIt's subconscious and you experience it\nas the desire to seek out more pleasure.\nHowever, it's actually\nmore diabolical than that.\nAnd we really need to keep an eye on this\nif we are to remain happy,\nif we are to remain in\npursuit of our goals.\nThe crucial thing to\nunderstand is that if we remain\nin constant pursuit of pleasure,\nthe pain side of the balance tips\nso that each time we are in pursuit\nof that pleasureful thing,\nactivity, or substance,\nwe are going to experience,\nwe literally achieve less dopamine release\neach subsequent time.\nSo we get less pleasure and the\namount of craving increases.\nNow, after a certain point or threshold,\nwe call that addiction.\nAnd the way to reset the balance,\nand this is very important,\nthe way to reset the balance\nis actually to enter into states\nin which we are not in\npursuit of pleasure,\nto literally enter states\nin which we are bored,\nmaybe even a little bored and anxious,\nand that resets the pleasure pain balance\nso that we can return to\nour pursuit of pleasure\nin a way that's healthy,\nand then in an ongoing way,\nwon't lead to this over\ntipping or this increase\nin the amount of pain or addiction.\nSo this is very important.\nAnd if this seemed vague,\nwhat this means is we\nshould always be cautious\nof any state of mind\nor body or any pursuit\nthat leads to very large\nincreases in dopamine.\nAnd if it does, we should be very careful\nto not pursue that repeatedly over time.\nDuring today's episode, I'm\ngoing to give an example,\na real life example of a\ndiscussion that I've been in\nwith a young man who's 21 years old\nwho's dealing with a disruption\nin this pleasure pain balance.\nHe is essentially depressed\nand he's depressed\nbecause of his ongoing pursuit\nof a particular activity\nthat initially led to a lot of dopamine,\nbut over time has led to\nless and less dopamine\nand more and more of this\npain side of the balance.\nWe could call him addicted\nto that particular activity.\nWhether or not he's addicted\nby clinical standards or not,\nreally, isn't important.\nWhat is important is that he\nexperiences this as depression,\nas low affect as it's called or anhedonia,\nan inability to experience\npleasure from that thing\nor from anything else.\nAnd he's currently undergoing treatment\nthrough a rebalancing of\nhis pleasure pain pathway.\nSo while I can't reveal\nhis identity to you,\nthat wouldn't be appropriate.\nHe did give me permission to reveal\nthe general architecture\nof what he's coping with.\nAnd I spent some hours with\nhim on the phone this week,\ntalking to him as well\nas to the various people\nthat he's working with\nto really understand\nwhat's going on here 'cause\nI think it can illustrate\nthe relationship between\ndopamine, pleasure, and pain\nfor sake of addiction,\nbut also for understanding how\nto avoid depressive states,\nhow to remove ourselves\nfrom depressive states.\nAnd as you'll see today,\nas we discussed depression,\nmany of the molecules and neural pathways\nand biological mechanisms\nthat we know can be used\nto counter depression,\nfeed back onto this pleasure pain balance.\nBefore we begin, I'd like\nto say that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be detected from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with most\nblood tests, however,\nis that you get information\nback about hormone levels,\nmetabolic factors, et cetera,\nbut you don't really know what\nto do with that information.\nSome things might be flagged\nas too high or too low,\nbut really interpreting\nthose data and taking action\nto bring those numbers into\nthe ranges that you want\nis what it's really about.\nAn InsideTracker makes all that very easy.\nThey have a platform, it's a dashboard\nthat will tell you for instance,\nwhat sorts of dietary changes\nor supplementation changes\nor exercise changes will help\nyou bring various hormones,\nmetabolic factors, and other\nfactors into the ranges\nthat are right for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code \"huberman\" at checkout.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an\nall-in-one vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink.\nI've been using athletic\ngreens since way back in 2012.\nAnd so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand that I still take Athletic Greens\nis that it really covers\nall of my foundational\nnutrient and micronutrient needs.\nIt has vitamins, minerals,\nand the thing that's especially\nimportant to me these days\nis the probiotics,\nbecause there are so many data\nthat show that having a\nhealthy gut microbiome\nis vital to having a healthy immune system\nand for healthy gut brain axis,\nliterally the functioning\nof your brain, your mood,\nvarious aspects of brain inflammation\nor limiting brain\ninflammation are facilitated\nby having a healthy gut microbiome.\nAnd that's facilitated by\ngetting the proper probiotics.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you can\nclaim their special offer.\nThe special offer is\nfive free travel packs,\nwhich make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road or in the car,\nand a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\nVitamin D3K2 have been shown\nto have a number of different\npositive health effects on hormones,\non cardiovascular health, and so on.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim their special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Belcampo.\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic,\ngrass fed, and finished\ncertified humane meats.\nI don't need a lot of meat.\nTypically my diet regime\nis one in which I fast\nuntil about noon,\nand then I have a lunch\nwhich is fairly low carbs.\nSo I'll have some piece\nof meat or chicken or fish\nand some salad typically.\nAnd then in the evening is when I tend\nto emphasize carbohydrates.\nThat helps me be really\nalert during the day\nand sleep well at night.\nWhen I do eat meat, I insist that the meat\nbe of the very highest quality\nand that it is sourced in humane ways.\nBelcampo's animals graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses,\nand that results in meat\nthat is higher in nutrients\nand healthy fats.\nThere are now a lot of\ndata pointing to the fact\nthat high levels of omega-3\nfatty acids are vital for mood,\nfor cardiovascular health\nand various aspects\nof maintaining what's called\na healthy Inflammatone,\nthe various things in our brain and body\nthat maintain a healthy\ninflammation response,\nbut one that doesn't go out\nof whack or get unchecked\nin any way that is detrimental to us.\nIf you'd like to try\nBelcampo, first-time customers\ncan get 20% off by going\nto belcampo.com/huberman\nand using the code \"Huberman\" at

phrase major depression\nis used to distinguish\none form of depression from the other,\nthe other one being bipolar depression.\nBipolar depression, sometimes\ncalled bipolar disorder,\nis really characterized by manic highs.\nSo where people aren't sleeping\nand they're talking very fast,\nand they're buying things\nand pursuing resources\nthat they can't afford,\nthey're starting\nrelationships left and right,\nthey're manic,\nfollowed by periods of\ncrashes of feeling very low,\nlethargic, and so on.\nBipolar depression is an\nabsolutely crucial thing\nfor us to discuss.\nAnd therefore we are\ngoing to have an entire\nseparate episode related\nto bipolar depression.\nToday, we're going to talk\nabout major depression,\nalso sometimes called unipolar depression,\njust because it doesn't\nhave the highs and lows.\nIt's more characterized by the lows.\nWe're going to talk about the biology,\nthe psychology, and\nthe various treatments,\nbehavioral, drug,\nsupplementation, diet, exercise,\nall of that.\nBefore we go forward into the material,\nI just want to emphasize\nthat any discussion\nabout mood disorders carries with it\na particular sensitivity,\nand that sensitivity is one\nrelated to self-diagnosis.\nToday's episode, and indeed\nin the future episodes\nfor this month on mood disorders,\nyou're going to hear various\nsymptomologies that are used\nto diagnose and characterize\nthese disorders.\nIf you recognize some of these\nsymptomologies in yourself\nor in others that you know,\nthat's an important thing to take note of.\nHowever, accurate diagnosis\nreally should be done\nby a qualified healthcare professional.\nSo at once I'm saying, keep\nyour eyes and your ears up\nfor things that sound familiar to you\nthat might be of concern.\nAnd at the same time,\nI'm saying don't necessarily\nleap to conclusions.\nTake those flags of\nconcern if they're there\nand bring them to a qualified\nhealthcare professional,\nand they'll be able to\nproperly diagnose you\nas having a particular mood\ndisorder or diagnose somebody\nas having a particular\nmood disorder or not.\nAnd that's an essential step.\nI don't say this to protect us,\nI said this really to protect you.\nOkay, let's have a fact-based\ndiscussion about depression.\nAnd I promise you that where\nwe don't know certain things\nabout depression, I will\nbe clear to tell you.\nIn fact, we are going to\ntalk about some treatments\nfor depression that are\nlooking very promising,\nand that right now are actually\nbeing used more and more.\nAnd from my read of the\nmechanistic literature,\nwe're still a bit in the\ndark as to how these work.\nThat's actually a common\ntheme of medicine.\nMany times there are\ntreatments that seem promising\nor that look really terrific.\nAnd there isn't a lot of\nunderstanding about mechanism.\nHowever, any good discussion\nabout neuroscience\nand in particular about mood disorders,\nhas to get into mechanisms.\nSo we're going to do that.\nAnd in doing that, we're\ngoing to frame the discussion\nfor the tools of how to\nkeep depression at bay\nand how to deal with it\nif you happen to find yourself depressed,\nor if you know somebody\nelse who's depressed.\nWhat is this thing we call depression?\nWas I mentioned before, it has two forms,\nbipolar depression, which\nwe're not talking about today,\nand major depression, also\ncalled unipolar depression\nis the other.\nMajor depression impacts\n5% of the population.\nThat is any enormous number.\nThat means if you're in\na class of 100 people,\nfive of them are dealing\nwith major depression\nor have at some point.\nLook around you in any environment\nand you can be sure that a\ngood portion of the people\nthat you're surrounded by\nis impacted by depression,\nor will be at some point.\nSo this is something we\nreally have to take seriously\nand that we want to understand.\nIt is the number four cause of disability.\nA lot of people miss work, miss school,\nand before then likely perform\npoorly in work or school\ndue to major depression.\nNow there's a very serious\nchallenge in having a discussion\nabout depression and it relates\ndirectly to the challenges\nin diagnosing depression.\nEarlier, I did an episode\nwith Dr. Karl Deisseroth,\nwho is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD.\nHe's a psychiatrist.\nAnd he made a very important point,\nwhich is that the field of\npsychiatry and psychology\nare confronted with a challenge,\nwhich is they're trying to\nunderstand what's going on\nwithin the stuff that's in our brains\nthat's deep to our skulls.\nWe don't have access to\nthat without brain imaging\nand electrodes and things like that.\nSomeone just comes into the\noffice and the dissection tool\nfor depression so to speak is language.\nIn order to determine if\nsomebody has depression or not,\nwe have to use language,\nhow they talk about things,\nalso how they carry their body.\nAlso some general patterns of health.\nSo let's talk about depression\nthe way that clinicians\ntalk about depression,\nbecause one of the issues is that\nwe use the word depression loosely.\nA lot of people say,\n\"Oh, I'm so depressed.\n\"I didn't get this job\nor I'm so depressed.\n\"I just don't know, I\nhad a really rough week\n\"or I'm exhausted.\n\"I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed\n\"I thought I was going to go on vacation\n\"and then they canceled the flight.\" Okay.\nThat is not clinical depression.\nThat's called being bummed\nout, being sad or disappointed.\nNow that person might be depressed,\nbut clinical depression\nactually has some very specific criteria.\nAnd those criteria are\nmainly characterized\nby the presence of certain things\nand the absence of a\nfew particular things.\nSo let's talk about the\nthings that are present\nin somebody that has major depression.\nFirst of all, there tends\nto be a lot of grief.\nThere tends to be a lot of sadness.\nThat's no surprise.\nThe threshold to cry is often\na signature of depression.\nNow that doesn't mean\nthat if you cry easily,\nthat you're depressed.\nSome people cry more easily than others,\nbut if you're somebody who\ntypically didn't cry easily\nand suddenly you find\nyourself crying very easily,\nthat could be a sign of depression.\nAnd I want to emphasize, could.\nThere's also this thing\nthat we call anhedonia,\na general lack of ability to enjoy things,\nthings that typically or\npreviously we enjoyed.\nThings like food, things like\nsex, things like exercise,\nthings like social gatherings,\na kind of lack of enjoyment\nfrom those things.\nSometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,\nand sometimes it's just flat,\nit's just kind of neutral.\nIt doesn't feel good\nbecause nothing there.\nIt's like bland food.\nIt's like these experiences are analogous\nto biting into your\nfavorite article of food\nand it just not tasting very good.\nIt just doesn't taste\nlike anything at all.\nAnd that's a common symptom\nof major depression.\nThe other one is guilt.\nOftentimes people with\ndepression will feel very guilty\nabout things they have done in the past,\nor they'll just generally\nfeel badly about themselves.\nAnd we're going to talk\nabout this because it relates\nto some of the more serious symptomology\nseen in depression sometimes,\nthings like self harm,\nmutilation, or even suicide.\nBut for the time being, we\nwant to frame up anhedonia,\nthis lack of ability to\nachieve or experience pleasure,\nor kind of a flat affect as it's called.\nSometimes even delusional thinking,\nnegative delusional thinking,\nand in particular anti-self confabulation.\nWhat is anti-self confabulation?\nWell, first of all, confabulation\nis an incredible aspect\nof our mind and our nervous system.\nYou sometimes see other\nforms of confabulation\nin people who have memory deficits\neither because they have brain damage\nor they have age-related dementia.\nA good example of this would be someone\nwith age related dementia\nsometimes will find themselves\nin a location in the house and\nnot know how they got there.\nAnd if you ask them, \"Oh,\nwhat are you doing here?\"\nThey will create these elaborate stories.\n\"Oh, I was thinking about\ngoing to the shopping today,\n\"and I was going to take the bus,\n\"and then I was going to do this.\"\nThey create these elaborate\nstories, they confabulate.\nAnd yet that person hasn't\nleft the house in weeks\nand that person doesn't\nhave a driver's license.\nAnd so they're really\njust creating this stuff.\nThey're not lying to get out of anything,\nthey're confabulating.\nIt's as if a brain circuit\nthat writes stories,\njust starts generating content.\nIn major depression,\nthere's often a state of\ndelusional anti-self confabulation,\nwhere the confabulation are not directly\nor completely linked to reality,\nbut they are ones that make the self,\nthe person describing them,\nseem sick or in some way not well.\nA good example would be somebody\nwho experiences a physical injury perhaps.\nMaybe they break their\nankle, maybe it's an athlete,\nand they also happen to become depressed.\nAnd you'll talk to them and\nsay, \"How are things going?\n\"How's your rehab though?\"\nAnd they go, \"Oh, it's\nokay. And I don't know.\n\"I feel like I'm getting\nweaker and weaker by the day.\n\"I'm just not performing well.\"\nAnd then you'll talk to the person\nthat they're working with,\ntheir kinesiologist or whoever\nthe physical therapist is.\nAnd they'll say, \"No, they're\nactually really improving.\n\"And I tell them they're improving,\n\"but somehow they're not\nseeing that improvement,\n\"they're not registering\nthat improvement.\"\nYou notice that sometimes it's subtle\nand sometimes it's severe, but\nthey'll start confabulating.\nYou'll say, \"I actually heard\nyou're doing much better.\n\"You're getting better,\nyou're taking multiple trips\n\"around the building now\n\"before you could barely get out of bed.\"\nAnd they'll say,\n\"Yeah, well basically,\nthey changed some things\n\"about the parking lot that\nmake it easier to move around.\n\"So it's not really me.\"\nAnd these aren't people that\nare just explaining away\ntheir accomplishments\n'cause they're trying to brush off praise.\nThey are viewing themselves\nand they're confabulating\naccording to a view\nthat is very self-deprecating\nto the point where it doesn't\nmatch up with reality.\nIt's not what other people see\nand it's actually not\nmatched up with reality.\nAnd that's a symptom of depression\nthat I think we don't often think about\nor conceptualize enough.\nSo it's not just telling people,\n\"oh yeah, it's not as good as\nit seems. Everything's bad.\"\nThese people really believe that\nand it becomes disconnected from reality.\nSo it's if they're sort\nof sinking into a pit\nand they're losing touch with\nthe realities of the world,\nincluding data about themselves,\ntheir ability to move and get around it,\nfor example, in that particular instance\nthat I used as an example,\nbut there are others as well.\nThe other common symptomology\nof major depression\nis what they call\nvegetative symptoms, okay?\nSo vegetative symptoms\nare symptoms that occur\nwithout any thinking, without any doing,\nor without any confabulation.\nThese are things that are\nrelated to our core physiology.\nThe word vegetative,\nyou might know it sounds like vegetable.\nIt actually relates to\na system in the body\nthat nowadays is more commonly called\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nThe vegetative nervous system\nand the autonomic nervous system,\nhistorically were considered\nsort of one in the same.\nAnd it relates to things\nlike the stress response\nor to our ability to sleep.\nSo vegetative symptoms\nbe things like constantly being exhausted.\nThe person just feels exhausted.\nIt's not because they exercise too much,\nit's not necessarily because\nof a life event, it could be,\nbut they're just worn out.\nThey don't have the energy they once had.\nSo it's not in their heads, it's probably,\nand now I think we have good\ndata to support the fact\nthat there's something off,\nsomething is disrupted in the autonomic\nor so-called vegetative nervous system.\nAnd one of the most common symptoms\nof people with major depression,\none of the signs of major\ndepression is early waking\nand not being able to fall back asleep\ndespite being exhausted.\nSo waking up at 3:00 AM\nor 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM\njust spontaneously and not\nbeing able to go back to sleep.\nI want to emphasize that that could happen\nfor other reasons as well,\nbut it is a common symptom\nor warning sign of major depression.\nSo let's talk more about\nsleep and depression.\nIt's well-known that the\narchitecture of sleep\nis disrupted in depression.\nWhat's the architecture of sleep?\nI've done entire episodes about this,\nbut very briefly in two sentences,\nalthough they're probably\nbe run on sentences,\nearly in the night,\nyou tend to have slow wave\nsleep more than REM sleep\nor Rapid Eye Movement sleep.\nAs the night goes on,\nyou tend to have more\nRapid Eye Movement sleep.\nThat architecture of slow wave sleep\npreceding Rapid Eye Movement sleep\nis radically disrupted\nin major depression.\nIn addition, the pattern\nof activity in the brain\nduring particular phases\nof sleep is disrupted.\nNow this is during sleep.\nSo this can't be that people\nare creating this\nsituation for themselves.\nThese are real physiological\nsigns that something is off\nin this so-called autonomic\nor vegetative nervous system.\nAnd then there are some\nother things that relate\nto the autonomic nervous system,\nbut that we normally think of\nas more voluntary in nature.\nAnd these are things\nlike decreased appetite.\nSo you can imagine that one\ncould have decreased appetite\nbecause of the anhedonia,\nthe lack of pleasure from food, right?\nIf you don't enjoy food,\nthen you might be less\nmotivated to eat it.\nThat makes sense.\nAs well because of these disruptions\nin the autonomic nervous system,\nthese vegetative symptoms,\nas they're called,\nyou can imagine that someone\nwould have decreased appetite\nbecause some of the hormones\nassociated with appetite,\nhypocretin orexin and things\nof that sort, ghrelin,\nthat those will be disrupted.\nAnd if those names of\nhypocretin orexin and ghrelin\ndon't make any sense to\nyou, don't worry about it.\nWhat those are just hormones\nthat impact when we eat,\nwhen we feel hungry, and\nwhen we crave food more,\nas well as when we feel full,\nwe have enough so-called satiety.\nIf you want to learn more about those,\nwe did entire episodes\non eating and metabolism.\nSo you can see that the\nsymptomology of major depression\nimpacts us at multiple levels.\nThere's the conscious level of\nhow excited we are generally.\nWell, that's reduced.\nThere's grief, there's\nguilt, there's crying,\nbut then there's also\nthese vegetative things.\nThere's disruptions in sleep,\nwhich of course make\neverything more challenging\nwhen we're awake.\nWe know that sleep is\nso vital for resetting.\nYou're waking up early, you\ncan't get back to sleep.\nThat's going to adjust your affect,\nyour emotions in negative ways.\nWe know this.\nAnd appetite is off.\nAnd there are hormones that get disrupted.\nSo cortisol levels are increased.\nIn particular, there's a\nsignature pattern of depression\nwhereby cortisol, the\nstress hormone that normally\nis released in a healthy way\nonly in the early part of the day\nis shifted to late in the day.\nIn fact, a 9:00 PM peak in cortisol\nis one of the physiological signatures\nof depressive like states.\nIt's not the only one, but\nit is an important one.\nSo there are a lot of things\ngoing on in major depression.\nAnd by now you're probably thinking,\ngoodness, this is dreadful.\nLike there's all this terrible stuff.\nAnd indeed it is terrible.\nIt is a terrible thing to find oneself\nin a mode where things\nfeel sad, you feel guilty,\nyou're exhausted.\nAnd oftentimes there's also an association\nwith the anxiety system.\nSo just because people are exhausted\nand lethargic and they don't enjoy things,\ndoesn't necessarily mean that\nthere's an absence of anxiety.\nThere can also be a lot of anxiety\nabout what's going to happen to me.\nAm I going to be able to\nachieve my goals in life?\nWill I ever get out of this state?\nAnd so things really start to layer on.\nAnd if this sounds depressing to you,\nit is indeed depressing.\nThis is really the place that\nmany people find themselves.\nAnd it's a pit that they just don't know\nhow to climb out of.\nSo let's just take a few minutes\nand talk about some of\nthe underlying biology\nthat creates this cloud\nor this constellation\nof symptomology.\nI think that's really important to do\nbecause if we want to understand\nthe various treatments,\nhow they work and why they\nwork and how to implement them,\nwe have to understand some\nof the underlying biology.\nSo let's spend a few minutes\ntalking about the biology of depression,\nwhat's known and what's not known.\nBecause in doing that,\nI think you'll get a much clearer picture\nabout why certain tools\nwork to relieve depression\nand why others might not.\nSo one of the most\nimportant early findings\nin the search for a\nbiological basis of depression\nwas this finding that there are drugs\nthat relieve some of the\nsymptoms of depression.\nThose drugs generally fall\ninto three major categories,\nbut the first set of\nones that were discovered\nwere the so-called\ntricyclic antidepressants,\nand the MAO inhibitors, the\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors.\nYou don't need to understand\nthat nomenclature,\nbut I'm going to give you\na little bit of detail\nso that if you want to\nunderstand it, you can.\nMost of this work took\nplace in the late 1950s\nand in the 1960s, and\ncontinued well until the 1980s\nwhen new classes of drugs were discovered.\nAnd these tricyclic antidepressants\nand the MAO inhibitors\nlargely worked by increasing\nlevels of norepinephrine\nin the brain, as well as\nin the body, in some cases.\nAnd they were discovered\nthrough a kind of odd\nset of circumstances.\nWe don't have time to\ngo into all the history,\nbut suffice to say that\nthey were discovered\nbecause of the exploration for drugs\nthat alter blood pressure.\nNorepinephrine impacts blood pressure,\nand drugs that lower blood pressure\nreduce levels of norepinephrine.\nAnd that in many cases, was\nshown to lead to depression\nor depressive like symptoms.\nAnd so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs,\nand the MAO inhibitors actually\nincrease norepinephrine.\nAnd frankly, they do quite a\ngood job of relieving some,\nif not all of the symptoms\nof major depression.\nHowever, they carry with\nthe many side effects.\nSome of those side\neffects are side effects\nrelated to blood pressure itself,\nby increasing noradrenaline,\nnorepinephrine as it's called,\nyou raise blood pressure.\nThat can be dangerous,\nthat can be uncomfortable.\nBut they also have a lot\nof other side effects.\nThe reason they have other side effects\nis because they impact systems\nin the brain and in the body\nthat impact things like\nlibido, appetite, digestion,\nand others.\nAnd we'll talk about each\nof those in sequence.\nOkay, so the experience\nthat clinicians had\nof observing some relief for depression\nwith the tricyclic antidepressants\nand with MAO inhibitors\nwas terrific, but there\nwere all these side effects,\nside effects that people\nreally did not like,\nthey didn't like these drugs at all.\nA lot of people get dry mouth,\nI mentioned the low libido,\nthey'd have sleep issues,\nappetite issues, weight gain.\nThey made some people so uncomfortable\nthat they preferred not to take them,\neven though when they didn't take them,\nthey had a worsening or a maintenance\nof their depressive symptoms.\nA decade or so later,\nthere was the discovery\nof the so-called pleasure\npathways in the brain.\nThese are pathways,\nliterally groups of neurons\nthat reside in different\nlocations in the brain\nbut connect to one another.\nSo it's a circuit.\nAnd when you stimulate these\nneurons with certain behaviors\nor with electrical\nstimulation in an experiment,\nbelieve it or not,\nthat's been done in\nboth animals and humans,\nanimals and humans become\nvery, very motivated\nto get more stimulation of these pathways.\nSo this pleasure pathway or\nthese circuits for pleasure\nare very what we call reinforcing.\nIn fact, animals and humans will work hard\nto get stimulation of these brain areas\neven more than they will\nwork to obtain sex, drugs,\nor even if they are addicted\nto a particular drug\nand they are in a state of withdrawal,\nthe ultimate state of craving,\nif given a choice, a person or an animal\nwill select to have stimulation\nof this pleasure pathway\ninstead of the drug itself.\nAnd that is a major and\nsignificant finding.\nThis pleasure pathway,\nas it's sometimes called,\ninvolves areas like the nucleus accumbens\nand the ventral tegmental area.\nThese are areas of the brain\nthat are rich with neurons\nthat make dopamine.\nAnd if you think to the\nsymptoms of depression,\nof anhedonia, lack of pleasure,\na lack of ability to experience pleasure,\nwell, that was a smoking gun\nthat there's something wrong\nwith the dopamine pathway in depression.\nAnd indeed that's the case.\nSo it's not just norepinephrine,\nit's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway\nis somehow disrupted.\nAnd then in the 1980s,\nthere was the discovery\nof the so-called SSRIs\nMost people are now\nfamiliar with the SSRIs,\nthe Selective Serotonin\nRe-Uptake Inhibitors.\nThe SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms\nfrom the tricyclic antidepressants\nand the MAO inhibitors.\nAs their name suggests, SSRI,\nSelective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors\nprevent serotonin from being\nwiped up from the synapse\nafter two neurons talk to one another.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, here's some very\nbasic Neurobiology 101.\nIf you don't know any neurobiology,\nyou're going to know\nsome in about 15 seconds.\nNeurons communicate with one another\nby spitting out chemicals into\nthe little gap between them.\nThe little gap between\nthem is called the synapse\nor by the Brits, the synapse.\nThose chemicals bind to the\nneuron on the opposite side\nand cause changes in the\nelectrical activity of that neuron\non the other side of the synapse.\nSerotonin is one such neurotransmitter\nor more specifically,\nit's a neuromodulator,\ncan change the activity\nof large groups of neurons\nin very meaningful ways.\nSelective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor\nmeans when a person takes this drug,\nsome of those drugs include\nthings like Prozac or Zoloft,\nthe more typical names\nor more generic names\nare things like fluoxetine,\nwhen people take those,\nmore serotonin hangs out\nin the synapse and is able to be taken up\nby the neuron on the opposite side\nbecause of this selective\nre-uptake inhibition.\nIt prevents the clearance of\nserotonin from the synapse\nand thereby more serotonin\ncan have an effect.\nSo SSRIs don't increase the\ntotal amount of serotonin\nin the brain.\nThey change how effective the serotonin\nthat's already in the brain is\nat changing the activity of neurons, okay?\nSo they don't increase serotonin,\nthey increase the efficacy\nor the function of serotonin\nin the way that I just described.\nSo that was more than 15 seconds,\nbut now you understand how SSRIs work.\nAnd I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs\nif they didn't in fact work.\nYes, there are many problems with SSRIs.\nThey do carry certain side\neffects in many individuals.\nAlso, about a third of\npeople that take SSRIs\ndon't derive any benefit,\nit doesn't relieve their\nsymptoms of depression.\nHowever, for the other two thirds,\nthere's often a relief of some,\nif not all of the symptoms\nof major depression.\nThe problem is the side effects\nthat accompany those SSRIs.\nAnd so these days SSRIs\nare a complicated topic.\nIt's sort of what I would\ncall a barbed wire topic\nbecause we often hear about\nall the problems with them,\nbut these drugs also have\nsaved a lot of lives.\nThey've also improved a lot of lives.\nThe issue is that they tend\nto have varying effects\non different individuals,\nand sometimes varying effects over time.\nSo they'll work for awhile then\nthey won't work for a while.\nThere are also a lot of\nmysteries about the SSRIs,\nand those mysteries bother people.\nWhat mysteries am I referring to?\nWell, SSRIs increase\nthe amount of serotonin\nor more specifically,\nthey increase the efficacy\nof serotonin at the synapse,\nthat happens immediately,\nor very soon after people\nstart taking SSRIs.\nBut people generally don't\nstart experiencing any relief\nfrom their symptoms of depression\nif they're going to\nexperience them at all,\nuntil about two weeks after\nthey start taking these drugs.\nSo there's something going\non there that's not clear.\nOne idea is that the SSRIs\nactually can improve symptoms\nof depression or even remove\nsymptoms of depression\nthrough so-called neuro-plasticity\nby changing the way that\nneural circuits function.\nAnd there are many on this,\nbut the main categories\nof studies on SSRIs\nthat relate to neuroplasticity\nfall into two camps.\nOne is that the ways in which SSRIs might,\nand I want to emphasize,\nmight be able to trigger\nthe production of more\nneurons in the brain,\nin particular areas of the hippocampus\ncalled the dentate gyrus and\nothers, that impact memory.\nThis is important. We're\ngoing to come back to memory.\nThe other is that the\nSSRIs have been shown\nin various scientific studies to reopen\ncritical periods of plasticity.\nI'll just briefly describe\none of those studies.\nThere was a study done by\nLamberto Maffei's group in Pisa,\nthat explored brain plasticity\nthat's known to be\npresent in young animals\nand disappear in older animals.\nAnd this is also true in\nhumans that younger humans\nhave a far more plastic\nbrain that can change\nin many more ways more easily\nthan can the older brain.\nAnd what they showed was\nthat fluoxetine, Prozac,\ngiven to adult animals can reopen\nthis incredible period of plasticity,\ncan allow more plasticity to occur.\nThat was interesting.\nI mean, it's purely through increases\nin serotonin transmission.\nAnd there are other studies\nshowing that fluoxetine\ncan increase the number of new neurons\nthat are born into the adult brain,\nso called neurogenesis, the\nproduction of new neurons.\nSo it's very clear that there are at least\nthree major chemical systems in the brain;\nnorepinephrine, dopamine,\nand serotonin that relate to\nand can adjust the symptoms of depression.\nAnd those actually can be\ndivided into separate categories.\nSo for instance, epinephrin\nor norepinephrine\nis thought to relate to the\nso-called psychomotor defects,\nsometimes called psychomotor retardation.\nThis is the lethargy,\nthis is the exhaustion,\nthis is the inability to get\nout of bed in the morning.\nDopamine is thought to\nrelate to the anhedonia,\nor I should say lack of\ndopamine in depressive patients\nis thought to lead to the anhedonia.\nThe lack of ability to\nexperience pleasure.\nAnd serotonin is thought to\nrelate to the grief, the guilt,\nsome of the more cognitive\nor more emotional aspects\nof depression.\nSo we've got the norepinephrine system\nrelated to activity and alertness,\nthe dopamine system\nrelating to motivation,\npleasure, and the ability to\nseek and experience pleasure,\nand then the serotonin system\nthat's related to grief.\nAnd unfortunately, brains and organisms\ndon't work in a simple mathematical way\nwhere you just say, oh, well,\nthis person's experiencing a lot of grief,\nbut they don't have any\nproblems with lethargy.\nAnd so let's just boost\nup their serotonin.\nOn paper it works,\nbut oftentimes it doesn't work clinically.\nAnd another patient,\nyou might get somebody\nwho can't experience pleasure,\nbut they're kind of anxious.\nThey don't have any trouble sleeping,\nbut they're just much more\nanxious and frustrated\nthan they normally are,\nand they meet the symptoms of depression.\nWell, you might think, oh, well,\ndo you just give that person\nsome drugs increase dopamine\nand everything will be better?\nAnd indeed, in some cases that's true.\nThere are drugs like Wellbutrin,\nwhich function more specifically\non the dopamine system\nto increase dopamine and they\nalso increase norepinephrine.\nMany people get great relief\nfrom things like Wellbutrin.\nThey don't really impact the\nserotonin system so much.\nAnd therefore you don't get\na lot of the serotonergic\nor serotonin related side effects.\nHowever, some people feel far\ntoo anxious on those drugs,\nsome people get addicted\nto those drugs in a way,\nbecause a lot of those\ndrugs that increase dopamine\nmake you want more of those drugs.\nSo you start to realize that\nwhat makes sense on paper\ndoesn't always make sense clinically.\nAnd this is why it's complicated.\nAnd a really good psychologist\nand a really good psychiatrist\nwill work with someone\nto try and pull and push\non these various systems\nto find the combination\nof drugs that may be\nor may not be correct for them.\nThere's a fourth aspect of\nthe chemistry of depression\nthat's really important to understand.\nAnd that's pain.\nWe've talked about pain\non this podcast before,\nbut even if you didn't hear\nthe episode on pleasure\nand pain, just want to\nemphasize that pain is something\nthat we experience in our\nbody, no surprise there,\nan injury, a cut, et cetera,\nbut that we also\nexperience emotional pain.\nAnd those systems are linked\nin very intricate ways.\nThere's actually some data\nshowing that pain relievers,\nTylenol, Aspirin, these sorts of things,\ncan help certain people\nwith emotional pain.\nNow I'm not recommending people run out\nand take those things for emotional pain.\nBut actually, if you think about it,\nthat shouldn't come as any surprise.\ngiven the enormous number of\npeople that take painkillers,\nopioids and things like\nthem to try and relieve\ntheir psychological pain.\nAnd as we know, those drugs\nare very, very problematic\nfor many individuals.\nThey can help certain individuals,\nbut they are very prone to abuse\nand they can induce addiction very easily\nin a number of people.\nThere's a substance that's\nliterally called substance P,\nthe letter P, that's manufactured\nby neurons in our brain\nand body, which underlies\nour sensation of pain.\nAnd indeed substance P\ninhibitors have been used\nto treat depression,\nand in some cases works.\nA lot of people with depression\nare hypersensitive to pain,\nand of course they could have\nmultiple things going on.\nThey could have chronic\npain or chronic injury\nand major depression.\nSo you start to get the constellation\nof the many things that could happen.\nSo that's all I want to say\ntoday about the chemistry\nunderlying depression or major depression.\nThere's a lot more there,\nbut I think if you understand\nthe norepinephrine system\nand that it relates to some\nof these things like lethargy,\nthe psychomotor defects,\nas they're called,\ndopamine and how it relates to motivation\nand lack of motivation and lack\nof dopamine and depression,\nand serotonin and its\nrelationship to grief,\nand that low serotonin can\nlead to extreme grief and shame\nand higher serotonin levels\ncan sometimes restore\na sense of wellbeing and safety\nand feeling good about oneself.\nIf you understand that and you\nunderstand that physical pain\nis somehow involved in certain cases,\nI think you will know\nmore about depression\nand its underlying chemistry\nthan most all people out there.\nAnd if you'd like to learn more,\nI invite you to pursue\nsearching those terms\nfurther on the internet.\nAnd we'll certainly go\ninto them in more depth.\nBut that really sets the stage\nfor where we're headed next.\nSo next I'd like to talk about hormones\nand how they relate to depression.\nAnd I'd also like to talk about stress\nand how it relates to depression,\nas well as talk about some of the genetics\nor the predispositions to depression.\nAnd for those of you that are thinking,\nhey, I want the tools.\nI want to know how to fix depression.\nI understand the desire for that.\nI will just ask if you\nhang in here with me\na little bit longer, not only\nwill you learn a lot more\nabout how this complicated\nmood disorder works,\nsome of the more\ninteresting things about it,\nbut it will also position\nyou to get a lot more\nout of the tools that we will describe.\nYou always have the option\nto skip forward of course,\nbut I think it's important to understand\nsome of the hormonal and stress-related\naspects of depression.\nSo let's talk about hormones.\n20% of people that have major depression\nhave low thyroid hormone.\nThyroid hormone is related to metabolism.\nOftentimes we think about\nthyroid is only related\nto having a fast metabolism,\nbut thyroid is related to\nall forms of metabolism,\nincluding our ability to\nsynthesize new tissues\nlike protein and repair injuries.\nI did a whole episode on\nthyroid and growth hormone.\nIf you want to check that out,\nall of that is archived\nat hubermanlab.com.\nIt's all timestamped, et cetera.\nYou can find on YouTube, Apple,\nSpotify, all those places.\nSo if you're curious about thyroid hormone\nand growth hormone, and you want\nto do the deep dive on those,\nand you want to learn\nhow to alter their levels\nusing various approaches, check that out.\nBut 20% of people with major\ndepression are hypo thyroidal.\nThey don't make enough thyroid.\nAnd that leads to low energy,\nlow metabolism in the brain and body.\nAnd there's a condition\ncalled Hashimoto's,\nwhich is essentially low thyroid output.\nAnd again, I don't want\nto get into all the tools\nrelated to thyroid.\nSometimes a psychiatrists will\nprescribe thyroid medication\nto increase thyroid output\nin people that are depressed\nand that will work to\nrelieve the symptoms.\nSo there isn't necessarily\na direct problem\nwith serotonin, dopamine,\nand norepinephrine\nor substance abuse.\nSometimes it's a thyroid problem.\nSo there are certain\nsituations or conditions\nthat can impact the thyroid hormone system\nand make people more\nsusceptible to depression\nor make a pre-existing depression worse.\nAnd those are things like childbirth.\nSo it's well-known that\nwomen who give birth\ncan often undergo what's\ncalled postpartum depression.\nIt actually comes from the word\npost parturition depression.\nThey give birth,\nwhat's happier, what's\nmore joyful than the birth\nof a new healthy child,\nand they will lapse into a depression.\nAnd that's thought to\nbe hormonally related,\neither directly to the thyroid system\nor perhaps to the cortisol system as well.\nWe'll talk about cortisol in a moment.\nAs well, certain women\nduring certain phases\nof their menstrual cycle\nexperience symptoms\nthat are very much like\nclinical depression,\nand oftentimes are diagnosed\nwith clinical depression appropriately.\nAnd of course the menstrual\ncycle is associated\nwith shifts in hormone levels.\nAs well, menopausal and\npost-menopausal women\nare more susceptible to major depression,\nregardless of whether or not they've had\nthat major depression\nearlier in their life.\nSo these are things to\nbe on the lookout for\nand to definitely talk to a\ndoctor and get a blood panel\nthat hopefully includes\nmeasures of thyroid hormone\nand cortisol hormone.\nWhy cortisol hormone?\nWell more stress is\ncorrelated with more bouts\nof major depression across the lifespan.\nHow many bouts?\nWell, it turns out that as you go\nfrom having one to two to three,\nwell, when you hit four to five bouts\nof really intense,\nstressful episodes in life,\nthese tend to be long-term\nstressful episodes,\nyour risk for major\ndepression goes way up.\nSo whether or not you have\na genetic predisposition\nto depression or not,\none of the best things you can do\nto try and avoid getting depressed\nis to learn to control your stress system,\nto not go from short-term stress,\nwhich everybody experiences,\nwe all have short-term stressors,\nto medium term stress to long-term stress,\nand to not have too many\nbouts of long-term stress\nbecause that probability\nof getting depressed\ngoes way, way up.\nAnd this is something I've\nseen over and over again,\nnot just in my scientific\ncareer, but just throughout life.\nPeople in all sorts of\ndomains, young and old,\nI've seen that people will go through\na very intense relationship, a breakup,\nsometimes it's the staying\ntogether that stressful,\nsometimes it's a graduate\nschool that can be stressful,\nsometimes it's some other event.\nAnd then some months later\nthey become depressed.\nAnd that's because the stress system\nis associated with the\nrelease of cortisol.\nThe cortisol system\ncan dramatically impact\nthe way that these\ndifferent neuromodulators,\ndopamine, norepinephrine\nand serotonin function.\nAnd so there's this kind of\nlatent or longer lasting impact\non the systems that\nimpact mood and wellbeing.\nSo learning how to control\nyour stress is really key.\nIf you're not depressed or you're somebody\nthat has not lapsed into\na depression recently,\ntake control of your stress system.\nAnd we did an entire episode\non how to conquer stress,\nand that involves dealing\nwith stress in the short term,\nthe medium term, and in the long-term.\nAnd there are a lot of\ndifferent ways to do that.\nOne of the more important reasons\nfor learning how to counter stress\nin order to offset depression\nis that there is a genetic predisposition\nthat certain people carry\nto become depressed.\nThere are these studies now\nof many, many thousands of individuals,\nthese were mainly done in New Zealand,\nbut these studies have\nnow been done elsewhere,\nlooking at many tens of\nthousands of individuals\nwho carry particular copies of genes,\nwhat they call polymorphisms,\nin particular of a gene called 5HTTLPR,\nwhich is a serotonin transporter.\nSo this is a gene that\ncontrols or regulates\nhow much serotonin is\navailable in the brain.\nIf you have this gene, this polymorphism,\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you will be depressed,\nbut it greatly shifts your\nsusceptibility to depression\nunder conditions of stress.\nSo I realize some people\nare listening to this\nand some people are\nwatching it on YouTube.\nSo I'm going to describe this in a way\nthat doesn't require\nlooking at any graphs.\nWhat I want you to imagine\nis a very, shallow hill,\nlike a very mellow hill.\nIt's just a ramp set at\nabout 10 or 15 degrees, okay.\nWhat we're plotting there in your mind\nis that with each about of serious stress,\nso that could be trying to finish a degree\nor a relationship breakup, or\na family member that's sick,\nor the loss of a loved one or a pet,\nwith each about of stress, the probability\nthat you will experience a\nmajor depression goes up.\nHowever, if you carry this\ngene, this HTTLPR gene,\nthe steepness of that\ncurve goes way, way up\nwhere it's actually more like a line\nsuch that you need far\nfewer bouts of stress\nin order to lapse into a\nmajor depression, okay?\nSo if the typical person who\ndoesn't carry this polymorphism\nhas to experience two or\nthree or four or five bouts\nof stress before they\nlapse into a depression,\nsomebody with this gene is\nsusceptible to getting depression\nafter just one about or two\nbouts of intense stress, okay?\nSo that's how these genes work.\nThey don't preordain or\ndetermine you to be depressed.\nThey raise a susceptibility.\nAnd many genes,\nmany things related to\nheritability in general,\nwork in that way.\nAnd we know there's a\nstrong genetic component\nto depression.\nHow do we know?\nWell, in what are called\nconcordant monozygotic twins.\nSo these will be identical twins.\nAnd they can either be\nin one biological sack\nor two biological sacks while in utero,\nwhat's called monochorionic\nor dichorionic.\nWell, typically it's monochorionic.\nAnd identical twins, for\nwhich one of those twins\ngoes on to have major depression,\nthere's a 50% probability\nthat the other one\nwill have major depression.\nSo it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited,\nit's not 100% generic, as you might say,\nbut there's a much higher\npredisposition for depression.\nWhereas in fraternal\ntwins, that number drops,\nand in siblings, that\nnumber drops to about 25%,\nand in half siblings, it's about 10%.\nThe numbers vary from study to study,\nbut basically the more\nclosely related you are\nto somebody who has major\ndepression, the more likely it is\nthat you will also get major depression.\nAnd therefore, if you haven't\ngotten major depression,\nthe more likely it is\nthat you should take steps\nto learn to mitigate stress\nbecause stress is the major factor\nthat can trigger one of\nthese depressive episodes.\nSo we've covered a lot\nrelated to the stress\nand the hormones and the\nneurochemistry of depression.\nIn fact, I think this is probably\nthe deepest I've ever gone\ninto the biology of any\ntopic on this podcast\nbefore getting to any specific tools.\nI mentioned that learning\nhow to mitigate stress\nand deal with stress,\nlearning how to measure and\nadjust your thyroid hormone,\nthose might be useful.\nBut next I'd like to turn\nto some very specific tools\nthat people who both have depression\nor who are prone to depression,\nas well as people who\ndon't have depression\nand simply want to maintain a good mood,\nwho want to maintain a positive affect\nand pursuit of things in life,\nwhat are the things that you can do?\nIt turns out there are\nthings that you can do\nand all of the biology that underlies\nthe utility of those things.\nMeaning the reasons those things work\nwill now make sense to you\nbecause they adjust things\nlike serotonin and dopamine,\nand they adjust them through\nvery specific pathways.\nI know for many people\nlearning about mechanism\nis kind of grueling.\nI realized this podcast\nisn't necessarily one\nthat you can listen to passively\nwhile doing other things.\nAlthough I would hope\nthat you could do that\nand still enjoy it and\nextract the information.\nWhy mechanism?\nMechanism is so key\nbecause mechanism is a\nlittle bit like understanding\nsome of the chemistry of cooking.\nIf you read a recipe and\nyou can follow a recipe,\nyou often hear people say,\noh, I can follow a recipe.\nThat means that if you have\nevery ingredient in that recipe,\nyou're good.\nYou likely can make that\ndish. You can make that meal.\nHowever, if you understand a\nlittle bit of the chemistry\nof why salt has to be\nadded third and not first,\nor why the heat has to be\nadjusted at a particular time,\nwell then not only can\nyou follow a recipe,\nbut that also gives you flexibility\nfor when salt isn't available,\nor when you want to adjust\nthe flavor of the dish,\nor when you want to try a new dish,\nor you want to get experimental.\nSo when you understand mechanism,\nit puts you in a tremendous place of power\nto work with your system.\nSo it's not just plug and chug,\nlike take 12 milligrams of this,\nyou either feel better or you don't.\nYou can really start to\nunderstand how prescription drugs,\nsupplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,\nhow those things weave\ntogether to either work for you\nor not work for you and get you to paths\nof healthy mind and body.\nSo let's think about\nwhy any tool would work\nto relieve depression.\nWe've talked about how some of the drugs\nthat impact these different\nchemical systems might work\nand why they create some of\nthe problems they create.\nProblems are mainly created\nby the fact that they impact\nlots of systems in the brain and body.\nSo you take a drug to increase serotonin,\nbut that serotonin is also\nrelated, not just to mood,\nbut to things related\nto libido and appetite.\nAnd so you start disrupting\nmultiple systems.\nThe same could be said for\nbehavioral tools, right?\nThat any behavioral tool\nthat adjusts the levels\nof a particular chemical ought to perhaps,\nprovide some relief for\nsome of the symptoms\nof major depression.\nLet's take an example that\nI've talked about before\non the podcast, which is,\nif you get into a very cold\nshower, you take an ice bath,\nyou will release\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine\nin your brain and body.\nThere's no question about that.\nI don't think anyone\ncan really escape that.\nIt's a kind of a universal\nresponse to being in cold water.\nWell, if some aspects of depression\nare related to low\nlevels of norepinephrine,\nwill taking cold showers\nrelieve your depression?\nPerhaps it might even\nrelieve certain aspects\nof that depression.\nIs it a cure? Well, that's going\nto depend on the individual.\nWill exercise help?\nWell, if you go out for a run,\nyou're going to increase\nthe amount of norepinephrine\nin your body.\nIf you enjoy that run, it's\nlikely that you'll increase\nthe levels of dopamine\nand probably serotonin\nin your brain and body as well.\nWill that cure your depression?\nWell, there are a lot of studies exploring\nhow exercise can impact depression.\nAnd indeed, regular\nexercise is known to be\na protective behavior against depression,\nbut it also can help relieve\nsome of the symptoms of depression.\nSo you may ask yourself, why\nwould you need drugs at all?\nWhy would there be prescription drugs\nor the need for\nsupplementation or other things\nto alleviate the symptoms of depression?\nAh, well, that's the diabolical\nnature of depression,\nwhich is if people are far\nenough along in this thing,\nthis sometimes called disease,\nsometimes called disorder,\nbut major depression, oftentimes\nthey can't get the energy\nto even get up and take\na bath or a shower.\nThey have no motivation to do it,\nthey have no desire to go for a run.\nSo you say, \"Come on, let's\ngo, you'll feel better.\n\"I know you feel better, it\ngenerates all these chemicals\n\"I heard on the whatever\npodcast, Huberman Lab podcast,\n\"or another podcast\nthat getting into action\n\"does all these things.\"\nAnd they just don't want to do it.\nAnd to you, a person who's\nnot experiencing depression,\nthat perhaps could just seem\nlike the most frustrating\nand confusing thing in the world.\nBut it's very important to highlight\nthe fact that these circuits\nthat are accessible to some of us,\nthe circuits for happiness,\nfor pursuit of pleasure,\nfor exercise, for\ngetting in a cold shower,\nif that's your thing,\nthat those circuits are\npresent in all people,\nbut for certain people\nthat are experiencing major depression\nand are really in the\ndepths of their depression,\nthey can't really access\nthose circuits in the same way\nthat people who are not\nsuffering from depression can.\nSo I hope that makes it clear.\nIt's not offering any excuses for them.\nAnd indeed, I think those\nbehaviors would help\njolt them out of some of the\nsymptomology of depression,\nbut they're just not\naccessible to everybody.\nSo let's talk about the\nthings that people can do\nto deal with depression.\nAnd again, anytime you add a behavior\nor a tool or a supplement,\nor subtract a behavior, tool,\nsupplement, drug, et cetera,\nyou absolutely should\ntalk to your physician,\nespecially if you're somebody\nthat's dealing with major depression.\nI want to focus on the stress system.\nAnd I'm not just going to tell you\nto get sunlight in your eyes\nand to get a good night's sleep,\nalthough I think everybody should do that\non a regular basis, ideally every day,\ntalked about those ad\nnauseum on this podcast.\nThey will help your sleep,\nthey will help you alleviate stress.\nI think you should have\ntools to deal with stress\nin real time, et cetera.\nBut let's look at depression\nfrom the standpoint\nof a deeper biological phenomenon,\nwhich is inflammation\nand the immune system.\nThere's growing evidence now\nthat many forms of major depression,\nif not all of them, relate\nto excessive inflammation.\nNow inflammation plays an\nimportant role in wound healing.\nIt is a positive aspect\nof our immune system.\nOur ability to combat wounds,\ncombat illnesses, et cetera,\nbut inflammation gone unchecked,\ninflammation that lasts too long,\nor is of too high amplitude,\nmeaning too many anti-inflammatory\nor inflammatory cytokines\nand things of that sort\nin the body is bad.\nAnd there's decent evidence\nnow that inflammation\ncan lead to or exacerbate depression.\nAnd that if we want to control depression,\nor limit or eliminate depression,\nthat focusing on reducing inflammation\nand its associated pathways\nis a really good thing to do.\nAnd I think this is a really\ngood thing for everybody to do\nregardless of whether or not\nyou suffer from depression\nor not.\nAnd today we're going to talk\nabout exactly how depression\ncomes about through the\ninflammation pathway.\nSo, first of all, who\nare the major players\nin creating chronic inflammation\nin the brain and body?\nThey are the inflammatory cytokines.\nThings like IL-6, interleukin-6,\nthings like Tumor\nNecrosis Alpha, TNF alpha,\nthings like C reactive protein, alright?\nNot all of these are cytokines.\nYou have interferons and prostoglandins\nand a lot of these things.\nBut when we are stressed,\nchronically stressed,\nwe get inflamed, our brain\nand various locations\nof the brain become inflamed\nbecause certain classes\nof cells, in particular,\nthose glial cells,\nthe cells that are typically thought\nto just be support cells,\nthose cells and their biochemistry\nand their dialogue with the neurons\nof the brain and body\nstarts to become disrupted.\nI may have mentioned it\nearlier, I don't recall.\nBut I certainly mentioned\nit in an earlier podcast\nthat adrenaline epinephrin,\nwhen it's released in the body,\nit doesn't cross the blood brain barrier,\nbut there are certain things\nthat are able to cross\nthe blood-brain barrier\nwhen we are stressed.\nThings like the E2 prostoglandins,\nthose cross the blood brain barrier.\nAnd our blood and our brain,\ntherefore our brain and\nour body can communicate\nbecause certain things can\npass through this barrier\nwe call the BBB or the\nBlood Brain Barrier.\nAnd also we have something\ncalled the glymphatic system,\nwhich is really a plumbing system\nthat links the brain and body.\nIt's the link between the\nimmune system and the brain.\nWell, there is a set of\nactions that we can take\nin order to limit inflammation.\nAnd this has been shown\nin several quality peer\nreviewed studies now\nto reduce inflammation\nand to relieve some,\nand in some cases, all of the\nsymptoms of major depression.\nOne of those approaches\nis to increase our intake\nof so-called EPAs or\nEssential Fatty Acids.\nThere's now a very long list of papers\nin quality peer review journals\nshowing that when people ingest\na certain level of EPA\nomega-3 fatty acids,\nthe relief from depressive\nsymptoms matches the SSRIs.\nThat's incredible, right?\nThat essential fatty acids\ncould relieve symptoms of depression,\nas well as some of the\nprescription antidepressants.\nNow, this doesn't\nnecessarily mean you run off\nand stop taking your antidepressants\nif you've been prescribed\nthem, please don't do that.\nPlease talk to your physician.\nAnd I should mention that\nsome of the same studies\nhave shown that increasing our intake\nof these essential fatty acids,\nin particular, the EPA\nvariety of omega-3s,\ncan lower the effective\ndose of things like SSRIs.\nMeaning if we required a 50\nmilligram or 40 milligram dose\nof fluoxetine, that one\ncan get by on a lower dose\nand thereby perhaps not experience as many\nor as severe side effects\nby taking or supplementing with EPAs.\nNow, the threshold level\nseems to be about one gram,\n1000 milligrams of EPA.\nSo you will sometimes see\non a bottle of krill oil\nor fish oil or any other\nsource, even plant source\nor other source of EPA\nthat it's 1000 milligrams\nor 1200 milligrams.\nBut what's really important to look at\nis whether or not there's more\nthan 1000 milligrams of EPA,\nbecause the EPA in particular\nis what's important here.\nAnd actually in exploring\nsome of the literature\non the effects of EPAs on\ncardiovascular health, excuse me,\nas well as their effects on depression,\nthere's some interesting\ndose dependent responses,\nsuch that people who took\nanywhere from 400 milligrams\nto 5,000 milligrams of EPAs,\nachieved a variety of different benefits.\nAnd in some cases, some side effects,\nwe'll talk about those.\nAnd it does seem that this 1000 milligrams\nis the critical threshold for benefiting\nor getting some relief\nfrom depressive symptoms.\nBut people who took two\ngrams seem to do better.\nAnd in the cardiovascular health realm,\nthere it's a little more complicated.\nSome studies point to\na very positive effect\non cardiovascular health\nby taking increasing amounts\nof EPA, others, not so much.\nThe current data point to the fact\nthat for every gram of\nEPA that one ingest,\nthere's about a 9% improvement\nin cardiovascular health,\nthe same dose dependent\nimprovement on psychological health\nin combating depression\ncan't really be stated.\nI wouldn't say that the more EPA you take,\nthe better you're going\nto feel so to speak.\nI don't think the data point to that.\nHowever, it does seem\nthat if you take a gram,\n1000 milligrams or 2000 milligrams of EPA,\nthere does seem to be\nsome substantial relief\nfor many people, should\nemphasize many, not all,\nfor many people in major\ndepressive symptoms.\nSo how would this work?\nWell, turns out that these\ninflammatory cytokines,\nthey impact neurons and\nthe circuits of the brain\nthat relate to things like serotonin,\ndopamine, and norepinephrine.\nThese inflammatory cytokines\nact in a variety of different ways,\nbut they mainly act to inhibit\nthe release of serotonin,\nnorepinephrine, and dopamine,\nor the synthesis of serotonin,\nnorepinephrine and dopamine.\nAnd I'll give you one example of how EPAs\ncan positively impact this process.\nAnd then it points to a second tool,\nwhich is the proper\nutilization of exercise\nto offset the effects of depression.\nSo now you should understand\nwhy having healthy levels\nof serotonin is important\nfor maintaining healthy mood.\nIt's not responsible for all the aspects\nof having a healthy mood,\nthere's also dopamine and norepinephrine,\nbut it is a very important one.\nDopamine also called 5HT,\nessentially derives from a\nprecursor called tryptophan.\nTryptophan arrives into our\nsystem through our diet,\nokay, tryptophan is an amino acid.\nTryptophan is found in Turkey,\nit's found in carbohydrates.\nAnd that should therefore raise the idea,\nhmm, I wonder if one of\nthe reasons why people\nwho are depressed have such an appetite\nfor carbohydrate late in foods\nis because they're trying\nto get more tryptophan,\nand therefore more serotonin.\nAnd indeed that's the case.\nTryptophan is eventually\nconverted into serotonin.\nHowever, if there's excessive\namounts of inflammation,\nthese inflammatory\ncytokines cause tryptophan\nto not be converted so\nmuch into serotonin,\nbut to be diverted down\na different pathway.\nThe pathway involves something\ncalled IDO, Indoleamine,\nwhich converts tryptophan into kynurenine.\nKynurenine actually acts as a neurotoxin\nby way of converting into\nsomething called quinolinic acid.\nAnd quinolinic acid is pro depressive.\nSo if that seems like a\ncomplicated biochemical pathway,\nwhat's basically happening\nhere is that the tryptophan\nthat normally would be\nmade into serotonin,\nunder conditions of\ninflammation is being diverted\ninto a neurotoxic pathway.\nAnd ingestion of EPAs,\nbecause it limits these\ninflammatory cytokines,\nthings like IL-6, C-reactive\nprotein, et cetera,\ncan cause more of the\ntryptophan that one ingests\nor has in their body to be diverted\ntowards the serotoninergic pathway.\nExercise, it turns out,\nalso has a positive effect\non the tryptophan to\nserotonin conversion pathway.\nAnd the way it does it\nis really interesting.\nYou now know that tryptophan\ncan either be converted\ninto serotonin or it can be\nconverted into this neurotoxin,\nwhich is a bad thing.\nExercise, the activation of the muscles\nthrough rhythmic repeated use,\nin particular aerobic exercise,\nbut also resistance training\nhas been shown to do this to some extent,\ntends to sequester or shuttle\nthe contouring into the muscle\nso that it isn't converted\ninto this neurotoxin\nthat is pro depression, okay?\nThere are a lot of steps in the pathway\nleading to depression,\nbut what this essentially means\nis that hitting a certain\nthreshold level of EPA intake,\nwhether by supplementation\nwith fish oil or krill oil\nor through some plant source\nif you're not into\ningesting fish or krill,\nor trying to get up above\nthat 1000 milligram threshold\nfor EPA by ingesting\nparticular food sources,\nyou certainly can do it through food,\nyou don't have to supplement,\nbut it's easier to do with supplements,\nthat doing that will\nlimit the inflammation\nthat diverts tryptophan into\nthis neurotoxic pathway.\nAnd exercise as well, augments\nthis conversion of tryptophan\ninto serotonin because it takes this thing\nthat would potentially be a\nneurotoxin and it sequesters it,\nit pulls it away so that it can't actually\ngo have its pro depressive effects.\nSo you've got multiple steps here.\nWe're describing two tools,\nincreasing EPA and regular exercise\nas a way of increasing serotonin,\nsomewhat indirectly, right?\nIt's by limiting this bad pathway\nto promote the activity of a good pathway.\nBut from the data that are published\nin Quality Peer Review journals,\nit really appears that\nthis inflammation pathway\ndoes function to increase\ndepression through these pathways.\nAnd so knowing that there\nare behavioral steps\nand supplementation based steps,\nor if you prefer getting\nyour EPAs from typical food,\nfrom nutritional approaches,\nI find that very reassuring\nthat the mechanisms\nall converge on a common\npathway, serotonin.\nThat gives me great peace of\nmind that when people say,\nhey, go out for a run,\nor you should get outdoors exercise,\nor you should take fish oil\nlike the Scandinavians do,\nI have Scandinavian family\nmembers and they are known to,\nor I should say they are\nquite open about the fact\nthat during the winter\nmonths in particular\nwhen depression is more likely,\nbut throughout the year, really,\nthey make an effort to regularly\ningest high levels of EPA,\neither through ingesting\nfatty fish and its skin,\nI'm not a particular fan of ingesting\nthe skin of fatty fish,\nor by supplementing with Cod liver oil\nor other types of fish oil, sardines,\nand things of that sort, sardine oils.\nThere are a number of\ndifferent things out there\nthat one could use.\nSo I find it very reassuring\nthat there's a common biochemical pathway\nthat can explain why these\nthings not just work,\nbut why they should work.\nThey should work because they operate\nin the very same biochemical pathways\nthat antidepressants that\nare prescribed to people do.\nSo what does this mean for you?\nWell, if you're somebody who\nsuffers from major depression,\nagain, don't stop taking\nyour prescribed medication.\nTalk to your doctor,\nbut talk to them perhaps\nabout the EPAs and exercise\nand how these things can impinge\non the same biochemical pathways.\nIf you're somebody who is not suffering\nfrom major depression, I\nstill think these pathways\nare really important to understand.\nAnd actually knowing these\npathways is additional motivation\nto get regular exercise.\nI think we all know that\nwe should be getting\nanywhere from 150 minutes\nto 180 minutes per week\nof so-called zone two cardio\nfor cardiovascular effects.\nZone two is the kind of melowish cardio\nwhere you can sort of hold a\nconversation if you needed to.\nBut it's a little bit tough,\nyou're kind of sucking\nfor air a little bit.\nAnd that's going to limit\nthese depressive like symptoms,\nI think in all of us.\nI don't think that we\nshould think of depression\nas a strict threshold.\nI'm somebody who personally\nhas made the choice\nto take 1000 milligrams of EPA per day.\nI do that by supplementing fish oil.\nThere's debate out there\nas to whether or not\nit's better to take EPA\nNDHA in particular ratios,\nand whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,\nwhich is the so-called bad cholesterol.\nThat's getting really down into the weeds.\nAnd we can talk about\nthat in a future episode.\nBut for myself, I notice\na pretty substantial\npositive effect of taking anywhere\nfrom 1000 milligrams to 2000\nmilligrams of EPA per day.\nI do that through supplementation\nand I do strive to try and eat some fish,\neven though frankly, I've\nnever liked the taste of fish.\nFor those of you that would\nlike a little more detail\nor perhaps a lot more detail\ninto the effects of EPA\non depression and in\nrelieving depressive symptoms,\nand if you want to get into\nthe nitty gritty of it,\nI invite you to go to examine.com,\nput in depression, EPA,\nthey list off and have links to 28 studies\non the effects of EPA on major depression.\nIf you go to pub med,\nthere are many, many studies on this now\nthat date back several decades, really.\nIf you're interested in the\nspecific effects of EPA,\nas opposed to DHA,\nI want to point you towards\na particular study entitled,\nnot surprisingly EPA, but not\nDHA appears to be responsible\nfor the efficacy of omega-3\nlong chain polyunsaturated\nfatty acids supplementation\nand depression,\nevidence from a meta analysis\nof randomized control trials.\nThis is a really wonderful paper.\nThe author is Julian\nMartins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.\nIt was published in 2009.\nWe will provide a link to\nthis study in the caption.\nAnd that study is really\nthe one that at least to me,\npoints to why EPA in\nparticular is what's effective,\nand that whether or not\nDHA is problematic or not\nas a separate issue,\nbut it's really the EPA\nthat one wants to hit a\ncertain threshold level of\nif one's goal is to get\nrelief from depression\nor to keep depression at bay\nby keeping mood elevated,\nwhich is why I take a high-dose EPA.\nSo we've got EPA, we got exercise,\nnow you understand how\nthey work to adjust mood.\nNow, I want to talk about\nsomething that at least for me,\nwas quite surprising when\nI first learned about it\nfor sake of treatment of mood disorders,\nand that's creatine.\nCreatine has a number of\nvery important functions\nthroughout the body.\nFor those of you that are\ninto resistance training,\nand actually for those of you\nthat are into endurance training as well,\ncreatine has achieved a lot\nof popularity in recent years\nbecause supplementation with\ncreatine can draw more water\ninto muscles and can increase\npower output from muscles.\nSo it's something that does indeed work.\nThere have been debates\nabout whether or not\nit's unhealthy for the kidneys\nto take long-term creatine,\nsupplementation at high doses.\nAnd I invite you to go\ndown that rabbit hole.\nI think most people now accept the idea\nthat for most people, not\nall, but for most people,\nlow dose creatine\nsupplementation of anywhere\nfrom one gram to five grams per day\ncan have a number of positive effects\non physical performance.\nPeople with kidney issues, et cetera,\nneed to be especially cautious,\nbut creatine is interesting\nfor that purpose.\nHowever, there's also a\nso-called phosphocreatine system\nin the brain, and that\nphosphocreatine system\nhas everything to do with\nthe dialogue between neurons\nand these other cell types called, glial,\nand glial comprise several cell types,\nmicroglia, astrocytes, et cetera,\nbut the foster creatine system\nin the forebrain in particular,\nin the front of our brain,\nhas been shown to be involved\nin regulation of mood\nand some of the reward pathways\nas well as in depression.\nAnd there are now several\nstudies, at least three,\nalthough they're probably more\nby the time this comes out\nbecause they're coming\nout very quickly now,\nat least three quality\nstudies pointing to the fact\nthat creatine supplementation\ndoesn't just have these positive effects\non physical performance,\nbut can also be used as\na way to increase mood\nand to improve the symptoms\nof major depression.\nThis has been now done\nin several double blind\nplacebo controlled studies.\nThe studies have looked at women,\nhave it looked at men,\nhave looked at adolescents,\nsome of whom were taking\nSSRIs, some of whom were not,\nthey've done magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy.\nSo spectroscopy is a way that you can look\nat the concentrations of\nparticular in the brain\nin real time in humans,\nit can be used for other\nthings as well, of course.\nAnd basically what's been\nobserved is that increasing\nthe activity of the phosphocreatine\nsystem in the forebrain\ncan be beneficial or\nat least is correlated\nwith improvements in mood.\nSo let's just talk for a\nmoment about what's involved\nwith using or supplementing creatine\nin order to improve mood and\nperhaps even treat depression.\nFirst of all, when I talk about creatine,\nI'm talking about creatine monohydrate,\nthere are a number of\ndifferent forms of creatine.\nHere I'm talking about\ncreatine monohydrate.\nThe American Journal\nof Psychiatry in 2012,\npublished a study, which was a randomized,\ndouble blind placebo controlled trial\nof oral creatine monohydrate.\nAnd what it found is that it could augment\nor enhance the response\nto a selective serotonin\nre-uptake inhibitor,\nin particular, in women with\nmajor depressive disorder.\nSo like EPA, creatine supplementation\nseems to either lower the required dose\nof SSRI that's required\nto treat depression,\nor can improve the effectiveness\nof a given dose of SSRI.\nHowever, there are other studies\nthat have looked directly\nat creating supplementation\nin the absence of SSRIs.\nAnd those are interesting as well.\nThere's a wonderful and\nvery comprehensive review\non creatine for the\ntreatment of major depression\nthat includes beautiful\ntables of all the subjects\nand the dosages, et cetera.\nI'm not going to read off every line\nand every column in that review,\nbut we will provide a link\nto that review as well.\nOne of the things that's really striking\nabout the lists of\nstudies that they include\nis that most of them used dosages\nthat are pretty reasonable\nfor most people,\nanywhere from three grams to five grams,\nsometimes up to as many 10\ngrams per day of creatine.\nMany of these also were shown to increase\nactivity of this phosphocreatine\nsystem in the forebrain,\nand some show a relationship\nbetween that phosphocreatine system\nand a particular category\nof receptors in the brain\ncalled the NMDA receptor,\nN-methyl D-aspartate receptor.\nThe NMDA receptor is\none of the first things\nthat every budding\nneuroscientists learns about\nbecause it is the receptor\nthat has particular electrical\nand chemical properties\nthat make it a critical gate\nfor so-called neuroplasticity.\nSo it's not a receptor that's\nactivated in the brain,\ntypically for just the\nfunctioning of the brain\non a day-to-day basis.\nIt's a receptor that's activated\nwhen circuits are going to change,\nwhen they are inspired to change\nby some very strong stimulus,\nmeaning some experience,\nor in some cases a drug, or\nin some cases something else.\nBut the NMDA receptor\nis a kind of a key node\nfor shifting brain circuitry.\nAnd so while the details\naren't entirely clear,\nit seems that creatine supplementation\nleads to increases in the\nphosphocreatine system\nin the forebrain.\nAnd that increases in the\nactivity of the forebrain\nphosphocreatine system relate to changes\nin the way the NMDA receptors function\nand may lead to some of the plasticity,\nthe changes in neural\ncircuits that underlie\nthe shift from negative mood\nand affect to positive mood.\nNow, there are a lot of gaps.\nThere are a lot of little\nboxes or bins in the diagram\nI just laid out for you.\nAnd some of them are still\ntruly black boxes, as we say,\nmeaning, we don't really\nknow what's in them yet.\nAnd more mechanistic data are coming.\nHowever, when you look over\nthe data in this review,\nor when I look over the\ndata in this review,\nwhat you find is that\nthey're pretty striking\npositive effects of creatine.\nAnd one of the more interesting effects\nis that creatine has actually been shown\nto increase mania in people\nthat are already manic.\nAnd that's interesting,\nwe're not talking about\nbipolar depression today,\nbut it seems that creatine\nelevates levels of activation\nand kind of mood overall.\nAnd you could see why\nthat would be a problem\nfor somebody that's\nalready in a manic phase,\nbut it actually might be\nbeneficial for somebody\nwho is very low affect\nand has major depression.\nSo should you supplement with creatine?\nWell, as always, talk to\nyour healthcare provider,\nbut if you're somebody who\nis thinking about things\nthat you can do and\nthings that you can take\nin order to improve your\nmood, keep depression at bay,\nmaybe even support other\ntreatments for major depression.\nthe creatine system\nseems like a logical one.\nThere's at least strong studies\nand a good number of them\nto look to, to determine whether or not\nthat's right for you.\nI personally take five grams\nof creatine for other reasons.\nI take it for the physical\nperformance, enhancing effects,\nbut it's kind of nice\nto think that perhaps\nit's also helping me improve my mood.\nThat's a choice that I've made for me\nis in within the margins of\nsafety for me in my life.\nI don't know that it's\nright for everybody,\nbut I find it very interesting.\nAnd again, I find it\nparticularly interesting\nbecause there's a logical\nbiochemical pathway\nto support the finding\nthat it improves mood\nand can offset the effects\nof major depression\nin some cases, or can improve the effects\nof antidepressant\nmedication in many cases.\nWhen I see mechanism\nand I see effectiveness,\nand the mechanism and\nthe effectiveness map\nto a lot of the same mechanisms\nthat are involved in prescription drugs,\nthat gives me great reassurance\nthat this isn't just\nsome sort of mysterious\npathway or mysterious compound\nby which a creatine might be working.\nSo now we've kind of\nclustered together EPAs,\nexercise, and their\nrelationship to inflammation,\ncreatine and its relationship\nto forebrain function,\nand the phosphocreatine\nsystem, and this NMDA receptor.\nAnd as you'll see in a few minutes,\nthat NMDA receptor turns\nout to be vitally important\nand is actually one of\nthe main nodes of action\nfor some of the more novel\nand exciting therapeutics\nthat are being explored\nnow in psychiatric clinics.\nSo let's talk a little bit\nmore about this NMDA receptor\nand how it relates to some\nof the more experimental\nor novel therapeutic\ncompounds for the treatment\nof major depression.\nAnd the compounds that we're\ngoing to be talking about,\nyou may have heard of\nbefore, one is ketamine,\nwhich is getting increasing\ninterest in psychiatric clinics\nand in various experimental\nand clinical studies,\nand the other is PCP.\nBoth ketamine and PCP\nare known drugs of abuse.\nFor many years, people\nhave abused these drugs,\ngo by the street name,\nspecial K, et cetera.\nAnd they create dissociative\nanesthetic states.\nSo dissociative states\nwhere people don't feel\nas closely meshed with their\nemotions and their perceptions.\nIt's an odd state, I hear.\nAnd it's an odd state that clinicians\nare now leveraging for the\ntreatment of depression.\nAnd we'll talk about why that is,\nbut let's talk a little bit\nabout this NMDA receptor\nand why ketamine and PCP\nmight work for the treatment\nof depression or how they even could work.\nI want to be very direct\nthat this is an area\nthat still needs a lot of data.\nThere are however, some excellent papers\nfrom really terrific groups.\nOne of them is a paper that\nwas published in nature\nlast year, 2020.\nFirst author is Vesuna,\nSam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A,\nand the last author and\nthe lead on the study,\nwho was Dr. Karl Deisseroth,\nwho was a guest on the\nHuberman Lab podcast\na few months ago.\nHe's world expert in\nneuroscience, he's a psychiatrist.\nAnd this paper from Sam\nVesuna and Karl and colleagues\nexplored how these\ndissociative states come about.\nAnd they looked at this both\nin animals and in humans\nand found that there was a,\nessentially a common mechanism\nwhereby a particular layer of cortex,\nso your brain has this\nouter shell of tissue\nthat is called the neocortex.\nIt's where our perceptions lie,\nit's where our associations lie,\nit's a very important area for processing\ndecision-making and planning, et cetera.\nIt's literally stacks of cells,\nand one of those layers in the\nstack of cells is layer five.\nAnd the layer five neurons in particular,\nwent into a particular rhythm\nof electrical activity,\nthis one to three Hertz\nrhythm after mice or humans\nwere administered ketamine or PCP.\nThere was activation of a\nparticular area of the brain,\nthis retro splenium cortex as it's called.\nAnd the dissociative state that emerged\nwas an interesting one.\nAnd clinically what's\ndescribed in the trials\nfor ketamine and things like it,\nthat people who are\ndepressed will take ketamine,\nwill experience a kind of separateness\nfrom their grief and from their emotions.\nAnd that possibly there's plasticity,\nthere actually shifts\nin the neural circuitry,\nsuch that their emotions don't\nweigh on them so heavily,\nI'm using very loose language here,\nbut that they don't feel as over written\nor as burdened by their own emotions\nas they did previously\nto the ketamine therapy.\nNow, absolutely in no way, shape or form\nam I suggesting that people\nrun out and take ketamine\nin order to treat their own depression.\nThese drugs are still\nvery much experimental,\nalthough they are approved\nin certain contexts,\nat least in the U S,\nby prescription for the\ntreatment of depression.\nWhat's interesting to me is\nthat these dissociative states\nsound at least at the outset\nto be more of a separateness\nfrom everything.\nIt sounds a little bit\nlike depression itself.\nThat's sort of like\nanhedonia and an inability\nto experience pleasure.\nAnd then one takes a\ndissociative anesthetic\nand somehow is able to get relief\nby getting even further\naway from an experience.\nTo me, that doesn't make sense,\nbut that just speaks to\nthe fact that these drugs\nand these receptors and these pathways\noperate through very cryptic means.\nAnd we really don't understand\nall the pathways in the brain\nthat relate to motivation\nand mood and so forth.\nAnd the results with these ketamine trials\nare looking very promising.\nIn fact, there are a number of trials\nthat show that a fair number\nof people that take ketamine\nin a therapeutic setting\nlegally with a psychiatrist\nguiding the experience\nare able to get relief from their symptoms\nwithout the need for many,\nmany treatments with the drug.\nJust how many treatments varies\nfrom individual to individual,\nbut it's not like people have\nto take this stuff ongoing.\nThis is really an attempt to\ntap into this NMDA receptor\nthat is related to neuroplasticity.\nBoth ketamine and PCP\nessentially act as antagonists,\nwhich means they block the NMDA receptor.\nThey do it through different methods,\nnon-competitive and competitive for you\nchemists and pharmacologists out there.\nYou can look it up if you like.\nBut what's therefore even more surprising\nis that every neuroscientist\nlearns that activation\nof the NMDA receptor,\nnot antagonism or blocking\nof the NMDA receptor\nleads to changes in neural\ncircuitry in very profound ways.\nIn fact experimentally,\nand I've done these experiments myself,\nif you want to prevent plasticity,\nyou want to prevent an experience\nfrom reshaping neural circuitry,\nyou give an MDA receptor blocker.\nI've done that many times\nin the course of my experimental\nneuroscience career,\nnot to myself, obviously,\nbut in the course of doing experiments.\nSo it's still a bit mysterious\nto me how this could work.\nA couple things.\nOne is this layer five\nactivation is pretty interesting.\nWe're going to come back to layer five\nwhen we talk about yet another emerging\ntreatment for depression,\nwhich has psilocybin,\nso-called magic mushrooms,\nand the effects of psilocybin\non layer five neurons\nin the cortex.\nSo there's a common theme emerging here,\nwhich is that layer five\nactivity in the cortex\nmay be important for rewiring\nthe brain in certain ways\nthat can lead to recovery\nor to an alleviation\nof some of the symptoms\nof major depression.\nSo if this is sounding a\nlittle bit vague to you,\nit's because this is still\ntruly experimental and new,\nand still very much on the cutting edge\nof what's happening now.\nWe don't have all the answers.\nSo if it sounds like I'm\nmoving slowly through this,\nand I'm being extra\ncareful about what I say,\nyou are correct.\nYour antenna are correct in this case.\nI never want to misstep and\nsay something that's not true,\nbut that's especially the case\nwhen we're talking about\nexperimental therapies and drugs,\nwhich formerly were\ntaken as drugs of abuse,\nwhich are now being used as\ndrugs for therapeutic treatment\nin the clinic.\nThere is a very interesting study.\nThis was published in science in 2019.\nSo these are very recent studies.\nThe last author on this\nis Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"Sustained Rescue of\nPrefrontal Circuit Dysfunction\n\"by Antidepressant\nInduced Spine Formation.\"\nAnd here, when we hear spine,\nwe're not referring to\nspine as in your vertebrae,\nrunning down your spinal column,\nwe're talking about the spines,\nwhich are these little\nprotrusions on neurons.\nNeurons are not smooth by any stretch.\nIf you zoom in on a neuron,\nif you were to come to my lab\nand look down the microscope\nat a neuron and zoom in on it,\nyou'd find that some neurons are smooth,\nbut most neurons have\nthese little protrusions.\nAnd those little protrusions\nare called spines.\nAnd those little spiny\nprotrusions are little sites\nwhere neurons can reach\nout and form and receive\nnew synapses from neighboring neurons.\nSo they increase the\nsurface area of a neuron\nand allow new connections to be formed.\nAnd so spine formation is\nsynonymous with neuroplasticity,\nwhich is synonymous with\nchanges in circuit function,\nwhich is synonymous with changes\nin the ways that we think,\nwe feel, and we behave.\nAnd what was shown in the\nstudy is really interesting.\nWhat they showed is that ketamine\ncan relieve depressive symptoms rapidly\nby changing or increasing in this case,\nthe spines on these neurons\nin the prefrontal cortex.\nAnd if that word prefrontal rings a bell,\nwell, now you remember the\nphosphocreatine system,\nthe ingestion of creatine\nmonohydrate, and the forebrain,\nactivation of the\nforebrain were related to,\nin some way or another,\nto relief or improvement\nof major depressive symptoms.\nSo we're starting to\nconverge on a picture here\nwhereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,\nused in a therapeutic context,\nmay be increasing neuroplasticity.\nLiterally the changing of\nneurocircuits in the forebrain\nsomehow through dissociative states.\nAnd I don't want to speculate too much\nabout how that might come about,\nbut one of the things\nthat's such a resounding\nor repeating theme of major depression\nis that when you talk to somebody\nwho has major depression,\nit is a real downer.\nAnd I'm not being\ndisparaging of those people.\nBut if you've ever had a conversation\nwith someone who's depressed,\nthey're always talking about\nhow exhausted they are,\nor in really severe cases,\nthey are not even responsive at all.\nThey just kind of stare at you\nblankly, or they fall asleep.\nI mean, they're truly depressed.\nTheir system is lowered in\nterms of its activation state.\nSo I think that it's\ninteresting that the application\nof drugs that allow people\nto separate from that state\nof not caring or being\nuninterested or unwilling\nto do anything is actually\none of the paths to treatment.\nIt's not always about\njust getting people peppy\nand excited and happy.\nThere also seems to be requirement\nfor getting them distanced\nfrom their own grief.\nAnd this brings us back to\nsomething that we talked about\nway back at the beginning of this episode,\nwhich was this particular feature\nof the anti self confabulation,\nthat everything that\nhappens is a reflection\nthat I should say for\nthe depressed person,\nthat everything that\nhappens is a reflection\nof how life is bad and their experiences\njust point to the fact that\nnothing is going to get better.\nThis is the common language of depression.\nIf this is very depressing\nto hear me talk about it,\nit is heavy.\nAnd that's what it's like\nto hear these things,\nit's even heavier, of course,\nfor somebody to experience them.\nAnd those beliefs, those\npatterns of guilt and grief\nand anhedonia and delusional\nanti self confabulation,\nthose are the things that eventually,\nif they get severe enough,\nstart to convert into things\nlike self harm mutilation,\nand in the most tragic of\ncases, of course, suicide.\nAnd so I think we can\nlook to these treatments\nsuch as ketamine and PCP,\nbut in particular ketamine\nand its use in the clinic,\nas ways for people to get\ndistanced from the negative affect\nthat they feel isn't just\ninside them or overwhelms them,\nbut that for the very\nseverely depressed person,\nthey feel is them.\nAnd we hear this sometimes,\nyou are not your emotions.\nThat's a statement that I've\nalways been a little bit\nchallenged by.\nI mean, yes, indeed\nemotions are not who we are.\nThey are states that\nwe go into and out of,\nincluding happiness and sadness,\nbut they are very much a part\nof us when we experience them.\nWe don't experience them\nas next to us or behind us\nor across the room from us.\nWe experienced them as our emotions.\nThey are so much part and\nparcel with our experience\nof ourself that a statement\nlike we aren't our emotions\nis a very hard statement to digest,\nespecially for the depressed person.\nAnd so I think that the NMDA\nreceptor and its capacity\nto induce neuroplasticity,\ncircuit changes,\nthe fact that PCP and\nketamine are both showing\nactivation of neural circuits\nby way of suppressing\nactivity of the NMDA receptor,\nand some of the positive or\nexciting therapeutic outcomes\nthat are coming from this\nreally point to the fact\nthat ketamine and PCP and\nremoval of negative experiences\nor the experience of\na negative experience,\nsort of getting meta there.\nBut the experience of\na negative experience\nmay be an important path by which people\ntreat their depression, especially\nin its most severe forms\nwhere people are veering\ntowards self-harm, mutilation,\nand suicide.\nSo you may have noticed a theme,\nwhich is that certain\ncategories of approaches\nthat we've been discussing for offsetting\nthe symptoms of depression,\nsuch as exercise,\ningesting EPAs, reducing inflammation,\nor even the SSRIs for\nincreasing serotonin,\nfocus on changing some\ncore biological function,\nlike raising the amount\nof a chemical, serotonin,\nor reducing the amount\nof inflammatory cytokines\nin the brain and body.\nAnd yet things like ketamine\nfocus more on rewiring circuitry,\nchanging neural circuitry\nso that it functions better\nin the immediate and hopefully\nin the long-term as well,\nand keep people with major depression\nin what they call, remission,\naway from major depression.\nAnother category of treatments\nthat's being actively\nexplored now in laboratories\nand in the psychiatry\nrealm are the psychedelics.\nAnd that's a huge category of compounds.\nHowever, one in particular,\npsilocybin is one that's\nbeing most intensely\nand actively pursued for its capacity\nto treat major depressive disorder.\nI want to be very clear that the work\nthat I'm going to describe\nas work that's being done\nin university settings,\nuniversity hospitals,\nby scientists and psychiatrists,\nand these are clinical\nstudies, clinical trials,\nleading to peer reviewed data.\nAnd those are the data\nthat we'll be discussing.\nSome of the major luminaries\nin this area include,\nof course aren't limited to,\nbut include people like Matthew Johnson\nwho's at Johns Hopkins.\nWe'll discuss some of his\nwork now, and fortunate to say\nthat he will be coming\non the podcast as a guest\nto just scribe the studies\nin a variety of laboratories,\nworking on a variety of\ndifferent psychedelic compounds,\nbut let's focus on\npsilocybin for its capacity\nto rewire neural circuits\nand alleviate depression.\nThere have been anecdotal data\nor evidence over the years\nthat psilocybin has this capacity,\nhow does psilocybin work?\nWell, psilocybin, magic mushrooms,\nas it's sometimes called,\nmainly works on what's called\nthe serotonin 5H2A receptor\nwith some affinity for the 5HT1 receptor.\nWhat does that mean?\nWell, basically, you've\ngot a lot of different\nkinds of serotonin\nreceptors just as you have\na lot of different kinds\nof dopamine receptors\nor other types of receptors.\nThe advantage of having\ndifferent receptors\nexpressed in different\nparts of the brain and body,\neven on different parts\nof individual cells\nin the brain and body is that\nthe same compound, serotonin,\ncan have a diverse set of effects\non different cells and tissues.\nThis is also the basis of some\nof the side effect profiles\nof SSRIs, because maybe for instance,\nwe know that taking Prozac fluoxetine\nwill increase serotonin in one area,\nbut also in another area.\nAnd then they will go have diverse effects\non different brain circuits\nbecause of the variety of receptors.\nReceptors are just like parking slots\nwhere the molecule serotonin parks\nand has different effects.\nWell psilocybin engages\nor increases serotonin transmission,\nmeaning it increases\nthe amount of serotonin,\nmainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors,\nbut where in the brain does it happen\nand what are the major effects?\nFirst, let's talk about the major effects\n'cause I think that's what\npeople are interested in.\nThe study that I'd like to\nhighlight is a fairly recent one.\nIt was published in may of 2021 in Journal\nof the American Medical\nAssociation Psychiatry,\nso JAMA Psychiatry, and it's entitled,\n\"Effects of Psilocybin Assisted Therapy\n\"on Major Depressive Disorder,\na Randomized Clinical Trial.\"\nIt's an absolutely beautiful\nstudy, a very important study.\nIt includes some of the\nluminaries in this area\nlike Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan,\nRoland Griffiths, and others.\nWe will provide a link to this study.\nIt is available in its\nfull form at zero cost\nif you want to read it.\nIt's got a lot of detail.\nSo I'm just going to\nsummarize a few things,\nbut basically what they did\nwas they screened for patients\nto come into the clinic.\nThese were people that suffered\nfrom major depressive disorder,\nand administered either one\nor two rounds of psilocybin.\nThey used particular dosages\nthat are listed in the study.\nSo you can look it up if\nyou're really interested\nin that level of detail.\nTypically it was 20 milligrams\nper kilogram of body weight.\nSo it depends on body weight.\nOr 30 milligrams of\npsilocybin per 70 kilograms\nof body weight.\nThey were given in capsule form.\nSo people weren't eating the mushrooms.\nThis is obviously a very controlled study\nand they wanted to control\nthe dosages appropriately.\nThey were randomized to begin\nthe treatment immediately\nor after an eight week delay.\nThey had all the\nappropriate control groups\nthat one would like to see.\nWhat's really striking this study\nis that there was a very\nsignificant improvement\nin mood and affect and relief\nfrom depressive symptoms\nin anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people\nthat were subjects in\nthe study who received\nthe psilocybin treatment.\nAnd whether or not it was 50\nor whether or not it was 71%,\nvaried according to how\nlong after the study\nthey maintain these\nantidepressive effects,\nwhether or not they stayed in\nremission from the depression,\nbut these are really enormous\ninsignificant effects,\nand very exciting and are\npointing in the direction\nof psilocybin very soon,\nbecoming a treatment\nfor various forms of depression,\nincluding major depression.\nNow, of course, this is\nlimited to the laboratory\nat present.\nThere are a number of\nelements of these studies\nthat are important to take\ninto consideration too,\nwhich is that there are\nhighly trained guides,\nmeaning people to direct\npeople through the experience.\nAs Matthew Johnson has told me,\nthere is the occurrence from time to time\nof people having so-called bad trips\nof having anxiety attacks\nduring the hallucinations\nand all that.\nAnd they have ways to mitigate\nthat and deal with that\nbecause the guides are trained.\nThey have all the sorts of\nmedical monitoring devices\nfor heart rate and temperature and things\nthat one would like to\nsee for a study like this,\nbecause these are very powerful compounds.\nI don't want to give away any\nelements of the discussion\nwith Matthew Johnson,\nbecause it will be\nreleased in podcast form\nreasonably soon here,\nthe Huberman Lab podcast.\nBut one of the things that came up\nand is a fundamental question that I had,\nthat I think probably\nmany of you are asking,\nis does the experience that\none has on these compounds\nmake a difference for whether\nor not somebody gains relief\nfrom depression, from these\npsilocybin journeys or not?\nIn other words, does it\nmatter what they talk about?\nDoes it matter what they think about?\nDoes it matter if they have\na good trip or a bad trip?\nAnd I don't want to hold\nyou in too much suspense,\nI'll let Matthew provide\nthe more thorough answer.\nBut what's really interesting\nis there are some common themes\nto psilocybin administration\nand experience that lead to\nrelief from depressive symptoms,\nbut they are subjectively very varied,\nmeaning that whether or not people feel\nthey had a good experience\nor a bad experience,\nwhether or not people\nthought about their parents\nor thought about the color of the ceiling,\ndoesn't seem to have too much of an impact\non whether or not they receive relief\nduring these studies in\nthese clinical studies.\nIt seems like different people can have\nlots of different experiences\nand still receive benefit.\nAnd that points to something deeper.\nIt points to the fact that these drugs,\nwhich is really what they are,\nare rewiring neural\ncircuitry in a common way\ndespite a diversity of\nexperience while on the drug.\nAnd that itself is really interesting.\nAnd it takes us back to a\nplace that we've been before\nin this discussion, which\nis layer five of the cortex.\nThis area that ketamine\nseems to impact as well\nby generating rhythms of the,\nI mentioned one to three Hertz activity\nin layer five of certain\nareas of the cortex.\nWell, the 5HT1A receptor\nis known to be enriched\nin layer five of the cortex,\nand layer five of the cortex\nis a very interesting area\nbecause it's an area in which\nthere's a lot of lateral connectivity.\nSo connections between\ndifferent brain areas laterally,\ngenerally is what allows us\nto merge different senses.\nSo for instance, when we\nhear a sound off to our right\nover here, we turn to our right.\nThere's a very hardwired response.\nAnd typically we hear\nsomething off to our right,\nwe don't look to our left.\nThat's how hardwired some\nof these circuits are.\nWhat appears to be happening\nis that the activation\nof the serotonin system and\n5HT1A receptor in layer five\nis offering up or providing an experience\nwhereby the lateral\nconnections are able to engage\nmuch more broadly than\nthey would normally.\nNow that also could be a bad thing.\nAnd I asked Matt about this,\nthat sounds kind of spooky.\nI don't know that when I hear\nsomething off to my right,\nthat I want to look off to my left.\nThat could be highly maladaptive,\nespecially if it's a car\ncoming at me from my right.\nThat doesn't seem to be what's happening.\nIt's not really rewiring these\ndeeply reflexive circuits.\nIt's somehow rewiring\nassociations between events,\nemotional events, past\nevents, current events,\nand future events in\nways that allow people\nto get some sort of relief or distance\nfrom these narratives,\nthese depressive stories\nabout their past and\npresent and allow them\nto see new opportunity and\noptimism in the future.\nIt's really a fascinating thing\nif you really think about it,\nbecause I would have thought\nthat simply by ramping up\nlaterality of connections,\nmeaning that cross associations,\nthat things could either\nbe rewired randomly\nin ways that don't serve us,\nor would perhaps just\ncause no effect at all.\nSo it's either going to be bad or neutral,\nbut that's not really the\nway things are turning out.\nAgain, these are highly\ncontrolled studies.\nI do want to emphasize\nthat ketamine, psilocybin,\nthese things are still illegal.\nMost all places.\nThere are some regions and\ncities in the United States\nwhere they are locally decriminalized,\nbut they are not legal.\nThey're still illegal.\nSo what we're referring to here\nare indeed clinical studies\nin which people are taking them legally.\nI think it's very likely\nwe will see a shift\nin the legislature around psychedelics,\nand in particular, psilocybin\nin the not too distant future.\nAnd I think that for\nnow, what we should know\nis what Matt told me and what\nyou'll hear far more about,\nwhich is that psilocybin.\nthis one where in most cases,\ntwo dose treatments done in\na highly clinical setting,\ncontrolled setting with patients\nthat are carefully\nselected, can in many cases,\nthe majority of people\nreceive and maintain relief\nfrom their depressive symptoms,\nsimply through the experience\nof this psychedelic journey.\nI did ask them about micro dosing.\nI made it sound as if I'd\nnever heard about it before.\nMicrodosing, not micro dosing.\nMicrodosing, and his\nanswer was interesting.\nHis answer was that\nthe microdosing effects\ndon't seem to be nearly as\nimpactful as some of these,\nwell, let's just call them what they are.\nThese kind of high amplitude sessions\nthat there are just one or two,\nthere are some studies ongoing\nwhere there's more than two,\nbut that the microdosing\ndoesn't seem to compare\nto these macrodosing, I\nmentioned the dosages before,\nthis 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms\nor 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages\ngiven several weeks apart.\nSo you'll hear more about microdosing\nand other psychedelics and their impact\non depressive states and major depression\nin the episode with Matt.\nBut for the time being, it\nreally seems as if, again,\nwe're looking at neuroplasticity,\nwe're coming back to layer five,\njust like with ketamine and PCP.\nWe're hearing about layer five,\nwe're hearing about rewiring of circuitry,\nwe're hearing about a\ndissociation or a distancing\nof oneself from these\nnegative moods and affects\nand narratives, but\nthere's a key distinction\nbetween the ketamine work\nand the psilocybin work,\nwhich is that in the ketamine work,\nit really is about\ndissociating from experience\nduring the session with the psychiatrist,\nwhereas during the psilocybin journey,\nit's really about immersing\noneself in the experience\nand being fully present\nto that experience.\nThat does seem to be\nan important component\nand what the difference is there\nand why they both seem\nto provide some relief\nfrom major depression isn't clear.\nI think most likely it\ntakes us back to the fact\nthat this thing we call major depression\nclearly involves serotonin,\ndopamine, and norepinephrine.\nAnd in some individuals,\nthey may be more deficient\nin one or several of\nthose or all of those,\nwhereas in other individuals,\nit might be a different\ncollection of chemicals.\nAnd of course there\nare a tremendous number\nof other psychedelic compounds\nthat people are exploring\nfor treatment of major depression.\nBut really psilocybin is the one\nthat we have the most data on.\nMDMA has mainly been explored\nin the clinical realm\nfor treatment of trauma.\nThere are some trials ongoing\nfor treatment of depression,\nbut the big breakthrough\nseemed to be happening\nin the realm of trauma treatment,\nthe so-called maps\ngroup that's doing this,\nagain, legally in a clinical setting.\nAnd there are other groups\nthat are starting to do it as well.\nWe are going to do an\nentire podcast about MDMA\nand some related compounds.\nSo I'll save that discussion for then.\nOne of the most common\nquestions I get for this podcast\nis about different\ndiets, different regimes,\ndifferent nutritional\nplans, things like keto,\nketogenic diet, or vegan\ndiets, or intermittent fasting,\nor the all meat diet, the\nso-called lion diet, et cetera.\nThere are actually really interesting data\nrelating nutrition and diet\nto major depressive disorder.\nAnd I think we just need to frame this\nby returning to something\nthat was said earlier,\nwhich is that the\ningestion of carbohydrates,\nin particular carbohydrates\nand some meats like turkey,\nthat are rich in tryptophan,\nthis precursor to serotonin,\nare in many ways the\nself-medicating version\nof depression treatment.\nNow, to be clear, I'm not saying\nthat people should use food\nto medicate their depression.\nMany people do that reflexively however,\nthey reach for carbohydrate rich foods\nto blunt their cortisol, because\nthat's indeed what it does.\nIt blunts cortisol when you\ningest high carbohydrate foods,\nin particular starchy foods,\nand it does increase serotonin,\nin particular, if those\nfoods rather are rich\nin the amino acid tryptophan.\nNow ingesting food is wonderful\nand important and great,\nbut ingesting excessive\nfoods of any kinds,\ncarbohydrate or otherwise\nit's not healthy, of course.\nThere have been some explorations\nof whether or not a vegan diet can improve\nsymptoms of depression.\nNot a lot of data, not impressive data.\nThere have been very\nfew controlled studies\nlooking at the carnivore or all meat diet.\nOn that, I think there are now some\nthat are starting to spin up,\nmeaning those studies\nare starting to spin up.\nHowever, the ketogenic\ndiet has been explored\nfor its ability to relieve\ncertain symptoms of depression,\nin particular to what's\ncalled maintain euthymia.\nEuthymia is the kind\nof state of equilibrium\nbetween a manic episode\nand a depressive episode\nin a manic bipolar person.\nWe'll return to this\nmore in a future episode,\nbut it basically, maniacs\nhave highs and they have lows,\nbipolars, either cycle back\nand forth really quickly.\nSo rapid cycling bipolars\nor slow, some people\nSo really quickly can be day to day,\nother people it's month\nto month or week to week,\nthey're going highs and lows.\nAnd you hear about mania and\nyou hear about dysphoria,\neuthymia is that kind\nof place in the middle\nwhere people feel neither\ntoo high nor too low.\nAnd there are some interesting studies\nlooking at the ketogenic\ndiet for maintaining euthymia\nin manic depressives,\nbut also in people with\nmajor depressive disorder.\nWhy would this work?\nWell, we have to remember\nthat the ketogenic diet\nwasn't discovered so that\nself appointed nutrition gurus\ncould talk about it\nonline or so that people\ncould make money selling\nanything related to ketosis.\nAnd here I'm not disparaging\nof the ketogenic diet.\nIt's helped a lot of people.\nThe ketogenic diet was actually shown\nto be medically relevant for\nits use to treat epilepsy.\nIt turns out that in epilepsy,\nor in particular pediatric epilepsy,\nthat a ketogenic diet and\nthe shift of brain metabolism\nto predominantly one in which\nketones are being metabolized\nrather than more standard\nglucose tight metabolism,\ncan greatly reduce the\nnumber of epileptic seizures\nthat these children experience.\nIt's not always the case,\nbut it's often the case.\nAnd so you talk to a\nneurologist or a neurosurgeon\nwho's specialized in epilepsy,\nin particular pediatric epilepsy,\nand they'll tell you this,\n\"Oh yeah, the ketogenic\ndiet, in many cases, not all,\n\"can be very effective\nfor this treatment.\"\nHow?\nHow is it that a ketogenic\ndiet reduces seizures?\nWell, the way it reduces seizures\nis by increasing what's\ncalled GABA transmission.\nGABA is a substance that is\nnaturally released in our brain.\nIt's an inhibitory neurotransmitter,\nmeaning that when it's\nreleased into the synapse,\nit has the tendency to reduce the firing,\nto reduce the electrical\nactivity of the next neuron\nor sets of neurons.\nThere are various compounds\nthat increase GABA,\nin particular, GABA in the forebrain.\nOne common example would\nbe something like alcohol,\ndrinking alcoholic drink or two\nwill increase GABA transmission,\nironically will lower\nyour social inhibitions\nby increasing your\nneurochemical inhibition.\nIt basically suppresses the\nself-monitoring pathways.\nAnd if people drink enough,\nit will suppress all pathways\nand people will urinate\nthemselves and fall over.\nIt will eventually inhibit\nall sorts of pathways.\nSo the GABA system has\na rich array of effects\nall over the brain and body.\nBut alcohol tends to\nactivate the release of GABA.\nYou might say, well then\nwhy not just take alcohol\nto suppress seizures?\nWell, that be a terrible idea\nbecause there tends to\nbe a rebound excitability\nafter alcohol stops having its effects\non the GABA receptors.\nAnd so then there's an excitability\nfor which an epilepsy would be terrible.\nThe reason why the epileptic\ndiet is useful for epilepsy\nis that increases what\nwe call the tonic level,\nthe sort of the ti, the\nlevel of GABA in the brain,\nand that suppresses some\nof the hyperexcitability,\nthat is the characteristic\nfeature of epilepsy.\nAnd there are other drugs, for instance,\nthe benzodiazepines and\nthings of the Xanax, variety,\nValium, and so forth.\nThose increased GABA transmission.\nThose drugs also have a\nlot of potential for abuse\nand addiction, et cetera,\nand they're problematic for other reasons.\nBut the ketogenic diet,\nby way of increasing ketone metabolism\nor shifting brain's\nmetabolism over to ketones\ntends to modulate GABA such\nthat GABA is more active\nand adjust the so-called\nGABA glutamate balance.\nThis is getting technical,\nbut glutamate is an\nexcitatory neurotransmitter,\nGABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter,\nand their balance is\nvital for neuroplasticity,\nfor maintaining healthy levels\nof activity in the brain,\net cetera.\nAnd so there is decent evidence\nthat people with major\ndepressive disorders,\nin particular, the people with\nmajor depressive disorders\nthat are refractory,\nmeaning they don't respond\nto classical antidepressants,\ncan benefit, it seems,\nfrom the ketogenic diet.\nNow this is not always the case,\nbut for those of you out\nthere who are struggling\nwith major depression, and for\nwhich drugs have not worked,\nplease talk to your psychiatrist.\nI don't know how many of\nthem are up on the literature\nabout the ketogenic diet\nor the EPAs and the rest.\nPsychiatrists vary in\nterms of how involved\nin the current literature they tend to be,\nbut there are many excellent\npsychiatrists out there.\nMost of them in my experience,\nare actually quite avid\nlearners about what's happening\nand what's new in this realm\nthat they call psychiatry.\nSo it's really interesting that\neating in a particular way,\nlowering carbohydrates to\nthe point where you rely\non ketogenic metabolism in the brain,\nincreases GABA and can provide some relief\nfor depressive symptoms.\nAnd that in particular, that\nseems to have positive effects\nin people that are\nrefractory or don't respond\nto classic antidepressants.\nAnd that would include things\nlike fluoxetine, et cetera.\nI'll make one final point\nabout ketogenic diets\nand GABA and depression,\nwhich is that it's also been shown\nthat for people that\nrespond well to these drugs\nthat impact the serotonin\nsystem, dopamine system,\nor norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet,\nthere may improve the ability\nfor those drugs to work at lower dosages,\nwhich is reminiscent of\nwhat we saw with the EPA\nsupplementation.\nSo today we've covered\nwhat at least feels to me,\nlike a tremendous amount of material.\nThis topic of depression\nis indeed an enormous topic\nto try and get our arms around.\nWe talked about the symptomology,\nwe talked about some of the\nunderlying neurochemistry\nand biology,\nand then we talked about\napproaches to deal with it\nthat are really grounded in\nthe neurochemistry in biology.\nI just want to recap a few of those tools\nand what those things are.\nFirst of all,\nwe talked about making the\neffort to not overwhelm\nthe pleasure system.\nThat might seem counterintuitive.\nTo not overly seek out pleasure,\nor else one can find themselves\nin a place of depression.\nI mentioned way back at the\nbeginning of the episode,\na young man who I know\nto be really struggling\nwith depression, and it is thought,\nand we don't know for sure, but is thought\nthat some of that depression\nwas probably triggered\nby an overindulgence in video games\nand other highly dopaminergic activities\nto the point where those\nactivities eventually\nwere countered by the pain balance that\nDr. Anna Lembke described.\nAnd he now has to do those\nactivities repeatedly\nand for many, many hours\neach day, just to feel okay,\nnot even to derive pleasure from them.\nAnd worse, many other activities,\npractically all other\nactivities have lost their zest,\nthey've lost their excitement\nand his sense of pleasure\nfor them.\nAnd so there's a really\nactive campaign now\nto reset that system.\nSo, number one, don't\noverwhelm your pleasure centers\neither through activities or compounds.\nMight seem counterintuitive,\nbut you're setting yourself up\nfor anhedonia and depression\nif you do that.\nIt's not just about addiction that too,\nbut it's also about setting\nyourself for anhedonia\nand depression.\nHow often can you engage\nin these activities?\nWell, that's going to differ\nfrom person to person,\neveryone's slightly different,\nbut you should really\nmind your extreme highs\nand your extreme lows and\nbe cautious about those.\nWe'll probably have a Dr.\nLembke on again at a future time\nto try and get some more\nspecifics about that.\nBut if you do feel like you\nneed to reset that system,\nit really does seem like\na 30 day complete detox\nfrom whatever activity\nor substance that is.\nAnd ideally it doesn't\ncontinue after that 30 days,\nespecially in conditions\nof drugs of abuse.\nSecond of all, talks about\nthe norepinephrine system\nand how the norepinephrine\nsystem is really deficient\nin many forms of major depression.\nAnd in depression, there is\nnow more deliberate pursuit\nof nor epinephrin inducing\nactivities that are healthy,\nthat aren't adrenaline seeking per se,\nthings like cold showers,\nthings like particular\npatterns of breathing\nthat engage and tend\nto make us more alert,\nthings like exercise that\nwill increase our levels\nof noradrenaline.\nI'd be remiss if I said\nthat these activities\ncould completely eliminate\ndepressive symptoms\nin people with major depressive disorder.\nI don't think that's the case.\nAnd again, I want to acknowledge\nthat people with major depressive symptoms\noften don't have the\nenergy, the willingness,\nor the capacity to engage\nin some of these activities,\nbut things like cold shower,\ndeliberate cold showers,\nthings like regular exercise,\nthey aren't just feel good activities.\nThey actually engage the\nnorepinephrine system\nand keep that system tuned\nup and allow us to increase\nour norepinephrine levels\nat will on a regular basis.\nAnd their mood enhancing\neffects are real effects\nat the level of neurochemistry,\nthen we talked about EPAs,\nEssential Fatty Acids,\nand it's clear that for most people,\ngetting above 1000 milligrams\nand probably even closer to\n2000 milligrams per day of EPAs\ncan be beneficial for mood,\nespecially in attempts to treat\nor offset major depressive disorder.\nAre there side effects?\nWell, you need to explore\nthose for yourself\nand with your doctor,\neveryone has a different\nhealth background.\nFor the margins of safety,\nfor most people would\nprobably be quite large,\nbut for some people that\nmight not be the case.\nSo definitely check with your physician.\nWe also talked about exercise\nand how EPA and exercise\non a regular basis can offset\nthese inflammatory pathways.\nI want to mention something I've mentioned\non a previous podcast,\nbut in terms of keeping the Inflammatone,\nall these molecules that\ncreate inflammation,\nand then the inflammation can\nlimit the amount of serotonin\nthrough the pathways we described.\nIn order to do that, it's\nalso very, very useful\nto ingest two to four\nservings of fermented foods\non a daily basis or near daily basis.\nThese are data that were\npublished by the Sonnenberg Lab\nat Stanford recently in the journal Cell,\nCell Press Journal, excellent journal\nthat ingestion of these fermented foods\nreally keeps the gut microbiome\ntuned up, so to speak,\nwell in order to offset\nthese inflammatory cytokines,\nkeeping inflammation at bay,\nit just turns out to\nbe a really good thing\nin order to keep our mood in a good place.\nSo EPA, exercise, fermented foods,\ncreatine as a potential source\nof relief from depression\nor offsetting, or keeping us\naway from major depression\nor relapse into depression.\nAnd then we talked about\nthe prescription compounds\nand the compounds that are being used\nmainly in the course of\nstudies and of psychiatry\nand depression, things like\nketamine, PCP, psilocybin,\nand related compounds.\nAnd then lastly, we talked about ketosis,\nwhich may not be right for everybody,\nbut might be right for\ncertain individuals out there\nwho are grappling with this.\nIf you're learning from this podcast\nand hopefully enjoying it and\napplying some of the tools\nthat we describe,\nplease subscribe
