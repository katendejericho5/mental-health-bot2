    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're going to talk\nall about hearing and balance\nand how you can use your\nability to hear specific things\nand your balance system in\norder to learn anything faster.\nThe auditory system,\nmeaning the hearing system,\nand your balance system, which is called\nthe vestibular system, interact\nwith all the other systems\nof the brain and body and, used properly,\ncan allow you to learn\ninformation more quickly,\nremember that information\nlonger and with more ease\nand you can also improve\nthe way you can hear.\nYou can improve your balance.\nWe're going to talk about\ntools for all of that.\nThis is one area of science,\nwhere we understand a lot about the cells\nand the mechanisms in the ear\nand in the brain and so forth.\nSo we're going to talk\nabout that a little bit,\nand then we're going to get\ndirectly into protocols,\nmeaning tools.\nWe're also going to talk about ways\nin which the auditory and\nbalance system suffer.\nWe're going to talk about tinnitus,\nwhich is this ringing of the ears that,\nunfortunately, for people\nthat suffer from it,\nthey really suffer.\nIt's very intrusive for them.\nWe're going to talk about some treatments\nthat can work in some circumstances\nand some of the more\nrecent emerging treatments\nthat I think many people aren't aware of.\nWe're also going to talk about this,\nwhat seems like kind of a weird fact,\nwhich is that 70% of people, all people,\nmake what are called\notoacoustic emissions,\ntheir ears actually make noises.\nChances are your ears are\nmaking noises right now,\nbut you can't perceive them.\nAnd yet those can have an\ninfluence on other people\nand animals in your environment.\nIt's a fascinating aspect of your biology.\nYou're going to learn a\nlot about how your biology\nand brain and ears and\nthe so-called inner ear\nthat's associated with balance,\nyou're going to learn a lot\nabout how all those work,\nyou're going to learn\na lot of neuroscience.\nI'll even tell you what\ntype of music to listen to.\nAnd if you listen to me,\nyou can leverage that\nin order to learn faster.\nBefore we begin talking about the science\nof hearing and balance and tools\nthat leverage hearing and\nbalance for learning faster,\nI want to provide some information\nabout another way to learn much faster.\nThere's a paper that\nwas published recently.\nThis is a paper that was published\nin Cell Reports, an excellent journal.\nIt's a peer-reviewed paper\nfrom a really excellent group,\nlooking at skill-learning.\nNow, previously, I've talked about how,\nin the attempt to learn\nskills, the vital thing to do\nis to get lots of repetitions.\nYou've heard of the 10,000 hours thing,\nyou've heard of lots\nof different strategies\nfor learning faster,\n80/20 rule and all that;\nthe bottom line is you need to generate\nmany, many repetitions of something\nthat you're trying to learn.\nAnd the errors that you generate\nare also very important for learning.\nIt also turns out that taking rest\nwithin the learning\nepisode is very important.\nI want to be really clear\nwhat I'm referring to here.\nIn earlier episodes, I've\ndiscussed how when you're trying\nto learn something it's beneficial,\nit's been shown in scientific studies,\nthat if you take a 20-minute shallow nap\nor you simply do nothing\nafter a period of learning,\nthat it enhances the rates of learning\nand the depth of learning,\nyour ability to learn\nand remember that information.\nWhat I'm about to describe are new data\nthat say that you actually\nshould be injecting rest\nwithin the learning episode.\nNow I'm not talking about\ngoing to sleep while learning.\nThis is the way that the study was done:\nthe study involved, having\npeople learn sequences\nof numbers or keys on a piano.\nSo let's use the keys on a piano example.\nI'm not a musician, but I\nthink I'll get this correct.\nThey asked people to\npractice a sequence of keys,\nG-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G.\nAnd they would practice\nthat either continually\nfor a given amount of time,\nor they would just do that\nfor 10 seconds, they would play G-D-F-E-G,\nG-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,\nG-D-F-E-G for 10 seconds.\nAnd then they would take\na 10-second pause or rest.\nThey would just space take\na space or a period of time\nwhere they do nothing for 10 seconds\nthen they would go back\nto G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G.\nSo the two conditions, essentially,\nwere to have people practice continually,\nlots of repetitions,\nor to inject or insert\nthese periods of 10 seconds idle time\nwhere they're not doing anything,\nthey're not looking at their phone,\nthey're not focusing on anything,\nthey're just letting their mind drift\nwherever it wants to go\nand they are not touching\nthe keys on the keyboard.\nWhat they found was that\nthe rates of learning,\nthe skill acquisition and\nthe retention of the skill\nwas significantly faster\nwhen they injected\nthese short periods of rest,\nthese 10-second rest periods.\nAnd the rates of learning were,\nwhen I say significantly faster,\nwere much, much faster.\nI'll reveal what that\nwas in just a moment,\nbut you might ask why would this work?\nWhy would it be that injecting\nthese 10-second rest periods\nwould enhance rates of learning?\nWhat they called them\nwas micro-offline gains\nbecause they're taking their brain offline\nfrom the learning task for a moment.\nWell, turns out the brain\nisn't going offline at all.\nYou've probably heard of the hippocampus,\nthe area of the brain involved\nin memory and the neocortex,\nthe area of the brain that's involved\nin processing sensory information.\nWell, it turns out that during\nthese brief periods of rest,\nthese 10-second rest periods,\nthe hippocampus and the\ncortex are active in ways\nsuch that you get a 20 times\nrepeat of the G-D-F-E-G.\nIt's a temporal compression, as they say.\nSo basically, the rehearsal\ncontinues while you rest,\nbut at 20 times the speed.\nSo if you were normally getting just,\nlet's just say five repetitions\nof G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,\nG-D-F-E-G per 10 seconds.\nNow you multiply that times 20.\nIn the rest periods, you've\npracticed it 100 times.\nYour brain has practiced it.\nWe know this because they\nwere doing brain imaging,\nfunctional imaging of these people\nwith brain scanners while\nthey were doing this.\nThis is an absolutely staggering effect\nand it's one that, believe it or not,\nhas been hypothesized or thought to exist\nfor a very long time.\nThis effect is called the spacing effect.\nAnd it was actually first\nproposed by Ebbington in 1885.\nAnd since then, it's been demonstrated\nfor a huge number of different,\nwhat they call domains,\nin the cognitive domain.\nSo for learning languages,\nin the physical domain,\nso for learning skills that\ninvolve a motor sequence.\nIt's been demonstrated for a huge number\nof different categories of learning.\nIf you want to learn all\nabout the spacing effect\nand the categories of\nlearning that it can impact,\nthere's a wonderful review article.\nI'll provide a link to it.\nThe title of the review\narticle is parallels\nbetween spacing effects during behavioral\nand cellular learning.\nWhat that review really does\nis it ties the behavioral learning\nand the improvement of skill\nto the underlying changes\nin neurons that can explain that learning.\nI should mention that the\npaper that I'm referring to,\nthe more recent paper that injects\nthese 10-second little\nmicro-offline gains,\nrest periods is the work of the\nlaboratory of Leonard Cohen,\nnot the musician, Leonard Cohen.\nHe passed away, he was\nnot a neuroscientist;\na wonderful poet and musician,\nbut not a neuroscientist.\nAgain, the paper was\npublished in Cell Reports\nand we will provide a link\nto the full paper as well.\nSo the takeaway is if you're\ntrying to learn something,\nyou need to get those reps in,\nbut one way that you can get 20 times,\nthe number of reps in is by injecting\nthese little 10-second\nperiods of doing nothing.\nAgain, during those rest periods,\nyou really don't want to\nattend to anything else,\nas much as possible.\nYou could close your eyes if you want,\nor you can just simply wait\nand then get right back\ninto generating repetitions.\nI find these papers that Cell\nReports and other journals\nhave been publishing\nrecently to be fascinating\nbecause they're really\nhelping us understand\nwhat are the best protocols\nfor learning anything.\nAnd they really leverage\nthe fact that the brain\nis willing to generate repetitions for us,\nprovided that we give it\nthe rest that it needs.\nSo inject rest throughout\nthe learning period.\nAnd if you can, based\non the scientific data,\nyou would also want to\ntake a 20-minute nap\nor a 20-minute decompress period\nwhere you're not doing anything\nafter a period of learning.\nI think those could both synergize\nin order to enhance learning even further,\nalthough that hasn't been looked at yet.\nBefore we begin talking\nabout hearing and balance,\nI just want to mention that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI want to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast and make it clear\nthat we only work with sponsors\nwhose products we absolutely love,\nand that we think you\nwill benefit from as well.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses,\nthat, in my opinion are the\nvery highest quality available.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything\nabout their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were created\nwith performance in mind.\nThese eyeglasses and sunglasses\nhave a number of features\nthat really make them unique.\nFirst of all, they're\nextremely lightweight,\nthe optical clarity of\nthe lenses is spectacular.\nAnd for the sunglasses, they\nhave this really great feature,\nwhich is as you move\nin and out of shadows,\nor across the day, the amount\nof sunshine might change,\nyou always experience the\nworld as clear and bright,\nand that can only come\nfrom really understanding\nhow the visual system works.\nThe visual system has all these mechanisms\nfor adaptation and habituation.\nYou don't need to know\nhow those things work,\nbut the folks at Roka clearly do\nbecause you put these glasses on\nand you don't even notice that they're on.\nThey also stay on your face\neven if you get sweaty.\nThey were designed to\nbe used while active,\nso running and biking,\net cetera or indoors.\nOne thing that I really like\nabout Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nis that the aesthetic is terrific.\nEven though they were\ndesigned for performance,\nunlike a lot of sunglasses out there\nthat were designed for performance\nthat look kind of ridiculous,\nkind of space-age,\nRoka eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou could wear anywhere.\nThe aesthetic is really clean\nand they have a huge\nnumber of different styles\nto select from.\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,\nyou can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A, .com\nand enter the code\nHuberman to save 20% off\nyour first order.\nThat's Roka, R-O-K-A, .com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nour immediate and long-term\nhealth can only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent of DNA tests,\nwe can get further insight and information\ninto how our metabolism is working,\nhow our brain is functioning,\nhow our endocrine system,\nmeaning our hormone system is functioning.\nOne of the issues with a lot of companies\nand programs that involve\ngetting blood and DNA tests,\nhowever, is that you get\nthe information back,\nyou don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they\nmake all of that very easy.\nFirst of all, they can send someone\nto your home to take\nthe samples, if you like\nor you can go to a local clinic.\nYou get the information\nback and, of course,\nyou get all the numbers and\nlevels of hormone factors,\nmetabolic factors, et cetera,\nbut the dashboard at\nInsideTracker provides directives\nso that if you want to\nbring those numbers up\nor bring them down, or\nif you want to keep them\nin the same range, it\npoints to specific regimens\nrelated to nutrition, exercise,\nand other lifestyle factors\nso you can really move\naround those numbers\nto best suit your health\ngoals and health status.\nIf you want to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,\nand you'll get 25% off any\nof InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation\napp that's backed\nby 25 published studies.\nAnd in addition to those,\nthere are hundreds of studies showing\nthat meditation is\nbeneficial for our brain\nand for our body.\nOne of the challenges, however,\nis maintaining a meditation practice.\nI started meditating a long time ago,\nbut I found it very hard to\nkeep that practice going.\nThen I discovered the\nHeadspace meditation app\nand what I found was that\nbecause they have meditations\nthat are very short, as\nwell as some that are longer\nand some that are much longer,\nI could maintain my meditation practice.\nSometimes I do a short\nfive-minute meditation,\nsometimes I do 20-minute meditation,\nI try and meditate at\nleast 20 minutes per day,\nbut sometimes, some weeks, I\nonly do it five times a week\nand I'll just meditate for longer.\nSo with Headspace, you\nhave the full palette\nof meditations to select from.\nIf you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nget a free one-month trial\nso no cost whatsoever,\nwith their full library of meditations.\nSo that's the best offer that they have.\nSo, again, if you want to try Headspace\nand you want to get access to\nall their meditations for free\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\nOkay, well, if you can\nhear me, that's amazing\nbecause what it means is that my voice\nis causing little tiny\nchanges in the airwaves\nwherever you happen to be.\nAnd that your ears and whatever's\ncontained in those ears\nand in your brain can\ntake those sound waves\nand make sense of them.\nAnd that is an absolutely fantastic\nand staggering feat of\nbiology and yet we understand\na lot about how that process works.\nSo I'm going to teach it\nto you now in simple terms\nover the next few minutes.\nSo what we call ears\nhave a technical name.\nThat technical name is oracles,\nbut more often they're called pinna,\nthe pinnas, P-I-N-N-A, pinna.\nAnd the pinnas of your ears,\nthis outer part that is\nmade of cartilage and stuff\nis arranged such that it can capture sound\nin the best way for your head size.\nWe're going to talk about ear size also,\n'cause it turns out that\nyour ears change size\nacross the lifespan and\nthat how big your ears are\nor rather how fast your\nears are changing size\nis a pretty good indication\nof how fast you're aging.\nSo we'll get to that in a few minutes,\nbut I want to talk about\nthese things that we call ears\nand some of the stuff\ncontained within them\nthat allow us to hear.\nSo the shape of these ears that we have\nis such that it amplifies\nhigh-frequency sounds.\nHigh frequency sounds,\nas the name suggests,\nis the squeakier stuff.\nSo low frequency sound, Costello\nsnoring in the background\nthat's a low frequency sound\nor high frequency sound, okay?\nSo we have low frequency sounds\nand high frequency sounds\nand everything in between.\nNow those sound waves\nget captured by our ears.\nAnd those sound waves, for those of you\nthat don't maybe fully\nconceptualize sound waves,\nare literally just fluctuations or shifts\nin the way that air is\nmoving toward your ear\nand through space.\nIn the same way that water can have waves,\nair can have waves.\nSo it's reverberation of air.\nThose come in through your ears\nand you have what's called your eardrum.\nAnd on the inside of your eardrum,\nthere's a little bony thing that shaped\nlike a little hammer.\nSo attached to that eardrum,\nwhich can move back and forth like a drum,\nit's a little membrane, you\ngot this hammer attached to it.\nAnd that hammer has three parts.\nFor those of you that want to know,\nthose three parts are called\nmalleus, incus and stapes.\nBut basically, you can just\nthink about it as a hammer.\nSo you've got this\neardrum and then a hammer.\nAnd then that hammer has\nto hammer on something.\nAnd what it does is it hammers\non a little coiled piece\nof tissue that we call the cochlea,\nsometimes called the cochlea,\ndepending on where somebody\nlives in the country.\nSo, typically, in the\nMidwest, on the East Coast,\nthey call them coh-chleah.\nAnd on the West Coast, we call\nthem caw-cochlea, same thing.\nSo this snail-shaped\nstructure in your inner ear\nis where sound gets converted\ninto electrical signals\nthat the brain can understand.\nBut I want to just bring your attention\nto that little hammer\nbecause that little hammer\nis really, really cool.\nWhat it means is that sound\nwaves come in through your ears,\nthat's what's happening right now,\nthat eardrum that you have,\nit's like the top of a drum.\nIt's like a membrane, or\nit can move back and forth.\nIt's not super rigid and it\nmoves that little hammer.\nAnd then the hammer\ngoes, doom-doom-doom-doom\nand hits this coil-shaped thing\nthat we're calling the cochlea.\nNow the cochlea, at one end,\nis more rigid than the other.\nSo one part can move really easily\nand the other part\ndoesn't move very easily.\nAnd that turns out to be very important\nfor decoding or separating\nsounds that are low frequency\nlike Costello's snoring and sounds\nthat are of high frequency,\nlike a shriek or a shrill.\nAnd that's because within\nthat little coil thing,\nwe call the cochlea, you\nhave all these tiny little\nwhat are called hair cells.\nNow they look like hairs, but\nthey're not at all related\nto the hairs on your head\nor elsewhere on your body.\nThey're just shaped like hair,\nso we call them hair cells.\nThose hair cells, if they move,\nsend signals into the brain\nthat a particular sound\nis in our environment.\nAnd if those hair cells don't move,\nit means that particular sound\nis not in our environment.\nSo just to give you the\nmental picture of this,\nsound waves are coming in,\nbecause there's stuff out there,\nmaking noises like my voice;\nit's changing the\npatterns of air around you\nin very, very subtle ways;\nthat information is getting\nfunneled into your ears\nbecause your pinnas are\nshaped in a particular way.\nThe eardrum then moves this little hammer\nand the hammer bangs on this\nlittle snail-shaped thing.\nAnd because that snail-shaped\nthing, at one end,\nis very rigid, it doesn't want to move\nand at the other end, it's very flexible,\nit can separate out high-frequency\nand low-frequency sounds.\nAnd the fact that this\nthing in your inner ear\nthat we call the cochlea is coiled,\nis actually really important to understand\nbecause along its length,\nit varies in how rigid or flexible it is,\nI already mentioned that\nbefore and at the base,\nit's very rigid and that's\nwhere the hair cells,\nif they move, will make\nhigh-frequency sounds,\nand at the top, what's called the apex,\nit's very flexible and\nit's more like a bass drum.\nSo basically what happens\nis sound waves come\ninto your ears and then\nat one end of this thing\nthat we call the cochlea, at the top,\nit's essentially encoding\nor only responding\nto sounds that are like,\ndoom-doom-doom-doom.\nWhereas, at the bottom, it\nresponds to high-frequency sounds\nlike a cymbal, [clanging].\nAnd everywhere in between,\nwe have other frequencies,\nmedium frequencies.\nNow this should stagger your mind.\nIf it doesn't already, it should.\nBecause what this means is that everything\nthat's happening around us,\nwhether or not it's\nmusic or voices or crying\nor screaming or screaming of\ndelight from small children\nwho are excited, 'cause they're playing\nor 'cause they get cake;\nall of that is being broken\ndown into its component parts\nand then your brain is making\nsense of what it means.\nThese things that I've been talking about,\nlike the pinna of your\nears and this little hammer\nand the cochlea, that's\nall purely mechanical.\nIt has no mind of its own.\nIt's just breaking things\ndown into high frequencies,\nmedium frequencies and low frequencies.\nAnd if you don't\nunderstand sound frequency,\nit's really simple to understand,\njust imagine ripples on a pond.\nAnd if those ripples\nare very close together,\nthat's high frequency; they\noccur at high frequency.\nIf those ripples are further\napart, it's low frequency.\nAnd obviously, medium\nfrequency is in between.\nSo just like you can have waves in water,\nyou can have waves in air.\nSo that's really how it works.\nNow we are all familiar with light\nand how, if you take a prism\nand put it in front of light,\nit will split that light into\nits different wavelengths,\nits different colors, red,\ngreen, blue, et cetera.\nSo like the Pink Floyd \"Dark\nSide of the Moon\" album,\nI think, has a prism and\nit's converting white light\ninto all the colors, all the wavelengths\nthat are contained in white light.\nYour cochlea, essentially,\nacts as a prism.\nIt takes all the sound in your environment\nand it splits up those sounds\ninto different frequencies.\nSo you can think of the\ncochlea of your ear,\nsort of like a prism\nand then the brain takes\nthat information and puts it back together\nand makes sense of it.\nSo those hair cells in\neach of your two cochlea,\nbecause you have two ears,\nyou also have two cochlea,\nsend little wires, what we call axons\nthat convey their patterns\nof activity into the brain.\nAnd there are a number\nof different stations\nwithin the brain that\ninformation arrives at\nbefore it gets up to\nthe parts of your brain,\nwhere you are consciously aware.\nAnd because some of you\nhave asked for more names\nand nomenclature, I'll give that to you.\nIf you don't want a lot of detailed names,\nyou can just ignore what I'm about to say.\nBut, basically, the\ncochlea send information\nto what's called the spiral ganglion.\nA ganglion, by the way,\nif you're going to learn\nany neuroscience, just know\nthat anytime you hear ganglion,\na ganglion is just a clump, so\nit means a bunch of neurons.\nSo a clump of cells.\nSo the spiral ganglion\nis a bunch of neurons\nthat the information then goes off\nto what are called the cochlear\nnuclei in the brainstem.\nBrainstem is down near your neck,\nthen up to a structure\nthat has a really cool name\ncalled the superior olive,\nbecause you have one on\neach side of your brain.\nAnd if I were to bring\nyou to my lab and show you\nthe superior olives in your\nbrain or anyone else's brain,\nthey look like little olives,\neven that little divot in them that to me,\nit looks like a pimiento,\nbut they just call them\nthe superior olive.\nAnd then the neurons\nin the superior olive,\nthen they send information up\nto what's called the inferior colliculus,\nonly called inferior because it sits below\na structure called the\nsuperior colliculus.\nAnd then the information\ngoes up to what's called\nthe medial geniculate nucleus.\nAnd then up to your neocortex\nwhere you make sense of it all.\nNow you don't have to remember all that,\nbut you should know that\nthere are a lot of stations\nin which auditory information is processed\nbefore it gets up to\nour conscious detection.\nAnd there is a good reason for that,\nwhich is that more important than knowing\nwhat you're hearing, you need to know\nwhere it's coming from.\nIt's vital to our survival,\nthat if something, for instance,\nis falling toward us, that\nwe know if it's coming\nto our right side, if it's\ngoing to hit us from behind,\nwe have to know, for instance,\nif a car is coming at us from\nour left or from our right.\nAnd our visual system can help with that.\nBut our auditory and our\nvisual system collaborate\nto help us find and locate the\nposition of things in space.\nThat should come as no surprise.\nIf you hear somebody\ntalking off to your right,\nyou tend to turn to your\nright, not to your left.\nIf you see somebody's mouth\nmoving in front of you,\nyou tend to assume that\nthe sound is going to come\nfrom right in front of you.\nDisruptions in this auditory hearing\nand visual matching are actually the basis\nof what's called the ventriloquism effect,\nwhich we'll talk about in a\nfew minutes in more depth.\nBut the ventriloquism effect\ncan basically be described\nin simple terms as when\nyou essentially think\nthat a sound is coming from a location\nthat it's not actually coming from.\nWe'll talk about that in a moment\nbut what I'd like you to realize\nis that one of these stations,\ndeep in your brainstem\nis responsible for helping\nyou identify where sounds\nare coming from through a process\nthat's called interaural time differences.\nAnd that sounds fancy, but really,\nthe way you know where\nthings are coming from,\nwhat direction a car or a boss\nor a person is coming from\nis because the sound lands\nin one ear before the other.\nAnd you have stations in your brain,\nmeaning you have neurons in your brain\nthat calculate the\ndifference in time of arrival\nfor those sound waves in your\nright versus your left ear.\nAnd if they arrive at the same time,\nyou assume that thing is making\nnoise right in front of you.\nIf it's off to your right,\nyou assume it's over on your right.\nAnd if the sound arrives\nfirst to your left ear,\nyou assume, quite correctly,\nthat the thing is coming\ntoward your left ear.\nSo it's a very simple\nand mechanical system\nat the level of sound localization.\nBut what about up and down?\nIf you think about it, a\nsound coming from above\nis going to land on your right ear\nand your left ear at the same time.\nA sound from below is going\nto land on your right ear\nand your left ear at the same time.\nSo the way that we know where things are\nin terms of what's called elevation,\nwhere they are in the up and down plane\nis by the frequencies.\nThe shape of your ears\nactually modifies the sound\ndepending on whether or not\nit's coming straight at you,\nfrom the floor or from high above.\nAnd so already at the level of your ears,\nyou are taking information\nabout the outside world\nand determining where that\ninformation is coming from.\nNow, this all happens very,\nvery fast and it's subconscious\nbut now you know why if people\nreally want to hear something,\nthey make a cup around their ear.\nThey essentially make their ear\ninto more of a fennec fox type ear.\nIf you've ever seen those\ncute little fennec fox things,\nthey have these big spiky ears,\nthey look like a French bulldog,\nalthough the fox version\nversion of the French bulldog.\nThis big, tall ears,\nand they have excellent\nsound localization.\nAnd so when people lean in with their ear,\nwith their hand like this,\nif you're listening to this,\nI'm just cupping my hand at my ear,\nI'm giving myself a bigger pinna.\nAnd if I do it on the left\nside, I can do this side.\nAnd if I really want to hear\nsomething, I do it on both sides.\nSo this isn't just gesturing,\nthis actually serves a mechanical role.\nAnd actually, if you\nwant to hear where things\nare coming from with a much\ngreater degree of accuracy,\nthis can actually help because\nyou're capturing sound waves\nand funneling them better.\nIt's really remarkable, this whole system.\nSo you've got these two ears\nand because of the differences\nin the timing of when things\narrive in those two ears,\nas well as these differences\nin the frequencies\nthat certain things sound,\nor I should say the\ndifferences in the frequencies\nthat arrive at your ears,\ndepending on whether or\nnot the thing is above you\nor right in front of you or below you,\nyou're able to make out where things are\nin space pretty well.\nSo now you're probably starting to realize\nthat these two things\non the side of our head\nthat we call ears are there for a lot more\nthan hanging earrings on or\nfor other aesthetic purposes\nor for putting sunglasses on top of.\nThey are very powerful devices\nfor allowing us to capture sound\nwaves from our environment.\nNow I have a question for you,\nwhich is, can you move your ears?\nIt turns out that unlike other animals,\nhumans are not terrifically\ngood at moving their ears.\nOther animals can move their\nears even independently.\nSo Costello is pretty\ngood at raising his ears,\nthe two of them together,\nHe can't really move his ear separately.\nSome dogs can do that really well.\nIn fact, sighthounds and some scenthounds\ndo that exquisitely well.\nSome animals like deer and other animals\nthat really have very acute hearing\nwill put one ear down to\na very particular angle\nand will tilt the other one\nand they will actually capture information\nabout two distant sound-making organisms,\nthose could be hunters coming after them\nor other animals coming after them.\nThey are very good at doing this.\nWe're not so good at it.\nBut about 60% of people, it's thought,\ncan move their ears consciously\nwithout having to touch their ear.\nSo can you do that?\nMaybe you should try it.\nAsk someone to look at you\nand see whether or not you can do it.\nThe typical distances\nthat people can move it\nis usually no more than\ntwo or three millimeters.\nIt's subtle but can you flap your pinna\nwith just using mental control?\nIf you can, or if you can't,\ntry looking all the way to your right\nor all the way to your left.\nObviously, if you're driving a car\nor doing something or exercising,\ndon't put yourself in danger right now.\nBut if you move your eyes\nall the way to your left,\nwhich I'm doing now or\nall the way to my right,\nyou might feel a little bit of\na contraction of the muscles\nthat control ear movement.\nNow I want to ask you this:\ncan you raise one eyebrow?\nI'm not very good at it,\nI can do a little bit,\nbut it's mostly by like cramping\ndown my face on one side.\nAnd I certainly can't\nraise my right eyebrow.\nI can only do my left eyebrow.\nTrying to talk while I'm doing this,\nthat's why it looks strange.\nPeople who can raise\none eyebrow very easily,\nalmost always, can move their ears\nwithout having to touch them.\nIt's controlled by the same motor pathway.\nAnd there does seem to be a small,\nbut statistically\nsignificant sex difference\nin the ability to move one's ears.\nTypically, men can do\nthis more than women can,\nalthough plenty of women\ncan move their ears as well.\nNow, if you think that is all\na little strange or off topic,\nit's not because what we're\nreally talking about here\nis a system of the brain,\nbut also of the body\nof the musculature for\nlocalizing things in space.\nAnd so you might find\nit interesting to note\nthat one of the things\nthat we share very closely\nwith other primates,\nwith non-human primates,\nlike macaque monkeys and chimpanzees,\nif you look at their ears,\ntheir ears are remarkably\nsimilar to our ears,\nor rather our ears are\nremarkably similar to their ears.\nThe eyes of certain monkeys\nlike macaque monkeys\nare remarkably similar to human eyes.\nThis is one of the reasons why,\nif you look at a baby macaque monkey,\nit has this unbelievably\nhuman element to it.\nBut the ears of these\nprimates is very similar\nto our ears; our ears,\nsimilar to their ears.\nIf you're interested in ear movements\nand what they could mean\nand some of the things\nthat ear movements correlate\nwith in other aspects\nof our biology, there's\na nice paper, actually,\na scientific paper.\nThe author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E,\nit was published in 1995.\nI'll give a reference to that.\nIt's a review article that discusses\nsome of the sex differences\nin ear movement control,\nas well as the relationship\nbetween ear movements\nand eye movements.\nAnd it's a pretty accessible paper.\nIt's one that I think any\nof you who are interested\nin this topic could parse fairly easily.\nAnd there's some very\ninteresting underlying biology\nand some theories as to why humans\nwould have this so-called vestigial\nor ancient carry-over of a\nsystem for moving our ears.\nNow, if ear movement seems strange,\nnext, I want to talk\nabout a different feature\nof your hearing and ears\nthat's even stranger,\nbut that has some really\ninteresting implications\nfor your biology.\nAnd I'm guessing that\nyou've not heard of this.\nWhat am I about to describe\nare called otoacoustic emissions.\nAnd otoacoustic emissions,\nas the name suggests,\nare sounds that your ears make.\nBelieve it or not, 70%\nof people make noises\nwith their ears, but they\ndon't actually detect them.\nLike I said, you've never heard of this.\nOkay, that's not what I mean.\nBut what I do mean is\nthat 70% of people's ears\nare making noise that's\ncast out of the ear.\nAnd these otoacoustic emissions, actually,\ncan be detected by microphones.\nSometimes they can be\ndetected by other people\nin the room if they\nhave very good hearing.\nNow, it turns out that women\nor, I should be technical here,\nfemales who report\nthemselves as heterosexual,\nhave a higher frequency,\nnot frequency of sound,\nbut a higher frequency\nof otoacoustic emissions\nthan do men who report\nthemselves as heterosexual.\nWomen who report themselves\nas homosexual or bisexual,\nmake fewer otoacoustic emissions\nthan heterosexual women.\nThese are data that come\nfrom Dennis McFadden's lab\nat the University of Texas, Austin.\nHe actually discovered these,\nwhat are called sexual\ndimorphisms and differences\nbased on sexual orientation\nwithout looking for them.\nHe was studying hearing.\nHe's a auditory scientist\nand people were coming\ninto his laboratory\nand they were detecting\nthese otoacoustic emissions.\nAnd they started to notice\nthe group differences\nin otoacoustic emissions.\nSo they started asking\npeople about their sex\nand about their sexual orientation.\nAnd these differences fell\nout of the data, as we say.\nAnd it's interesting because\notoacoustic emissions\nare not something that we associate\nwith sex or sexual dimorphism.\nBut what these data really\nunderscore is, first of all,\na lot of us are making\nnoises with our ears,\nsome of us more than others.\nAnd that exposure to certain\ncombinations of hormones\nduring development are\nvery likely shaping the way\nthat our hearing apparati,\nmeaning the cochlea\nand the pinna and all sorts of things,\nhow those develop and how those functions\nthroughout the lifespan.\nWe did do an episode on\nhormones and sexual development,\nwhich gets much deeper\ninto the other effects\nthat hormones have on the\ndeveloping brain and body.\nIf you want to check out that episode,\nwe will put a link to it in the captions.\nSo now I want to shift to talking\nabout ways to leverage\nyour hearing system,\nyour auditory system so\nthat you can learn anything,\nnot just auditory information,\nbut anything faster.\nI get a lot of questions about\nso-called binaural beats.\nBinaural beats, as their name suggests,\ninvolve playing one\nfrequency of sound to one ear\nand a different frequency\nof sound to the other ear.\nSo it might be doomed, doon,\ndoon, doon to your right ear,\nand it might be to\nding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding\nto the left ear.\nAnd the idea is that the brain\nwill take those two frequencies of sound\nand because the pathways\nthat bring information\nfrom the ears into the\nbrain, eventually crossover,\nthey actually share that\ninformation with both sides\nof the brain, that the brain\nwill average that information\nand come up with this sort\nof intermediate frequency.\nAnd the rationale is that\nthose intermediate frequencies\nplace the brain into a state\nthat is better for learning.\nAnd when I say better for learning,\nI want to be precise about what I mean.\nThat could mean more focus for encoding\nor bringing the information in.\nAs you may have heard me say before,\nwe have to be alert and\nfocused in order to learn.\nThere is no passive learning\nunless we're little tiny infants.\nSo can binaural beats\nmake us more focused?\nCan binaural beats allow us to\nrelax more if we're anxious?\nI know some people, they go to the dentist\nand the dentist offers binaural beats\nas they drill into your\nteeth and give root canals\nand things of that sort,\nprobably causing some anxiety\njust describing those things right now.\nBut those are available\nin many dental practices.\nBinaural beats have been\nthought to increase creativity,\nor at least they have been\nproposed to increase creativity.\nSo what does the scientific\ndata say about binaural beats?\nThere are a number of\ndifferent apps out there\nthat offer binaural beats.\nThere are a number of different programs.\nI think you can also even\njust find these on YouTube\nand on the internet.\nBut typically, it's an\napp and you'll program in\na particular outcome that you want:\nmore focused, more creative, fall asleep,\nless anxious, et cetera.\nSo what does the scientific data say?\nSo believe it or not, the\nscience on binaural beats\nis actually quite\nextensive and very precise.\nSo sound waves are measured, typically,\nin hertz or kilohertz.\nI know many of you aren't familiar\nwith thinking about things\nin hertz or kilohertz.\nBut again, just remember\nthose waves on a pond,\nthose ripples on a pond.\nIf they're close together, then\nthey are of high-frequency.\nAnd if they're far apart, than\nthey are of low frequency.\nSo when you hear more hertz,\nwhat you're essentially\nhearing is higher frequency.\nAnd so if it's many more kilohertz\nthen it's much higher frequency\nthan if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz.\nAnd so you may have heard of\nthese things as delta waves\nor theta waves or alpha waves\nor beta waves, et cetera.\nDelta waves would be big,\nslow waves, so low frequency.\nAnd, indeed, there is quality evidence\nfrom peer-reviewed studies\nthat are not sponsored\nby companies that make binaural beat apps\nthat tell us that delta\nwaves like one to four hertz,\nso very low frequency sounds,\nthink Costello's snoring,\ncan help in the transition to\nsleep and for staying asleep.\nAnd that theta rhythms,\nwhich are more like four to eight hertz\ncan bring the brain into\na state of subtle sleep\nor meditation, so deeply\nrelaxed, but not fully asleep.\nAnd then you can sort of ascend\nthe staircase of findings\nhere, so to speak.\nAnd you'll find evidence that alpha waves,\neight to 13 hertz can increase alertness\nto a moderate level.\nThat's a great state\nfor the brain to be in\nfor recall of existing information.\nAnd that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz\nare great for bringing the brain\ninto focus states for sustained thought\nor for incorporating new information\nand especially gamma waves,\nthe highest frequency,\nthe most frequent ripples\nof sound, so to speak,\n32 to 100 hertz for learning\nand problem-solving.\nNow, all of this matches, or I should say,\nmaps onto what I've said before\nabout learning really nicely,\nwhich is that you need to\nbe in a highly alert state\nin order to bring new information in,\nin order to access a state of mind\nin which you can tell\nyour brain or the brain\nis telling itself, okay,\nI need to learn this.\nThis is why stress and\nunfortunate circumstances\nare so memorable is because our brain gets\ninto a really high alert system.\nHere, we're talking about\nthe use of binaural beats\nin order to increase\nour level of alertness\nor our level of calmness.\nNow that's important to\nunderscore because it's not\nthat there's something\nfundamentally important\nabout the binaural beats.\nThey are yet another way\nof bringing the brain\ninto states of deep relaxation\nthrough low frequency sound\nor highly alert states\nfor focused learning with\nmore high-frequency sound.\nSo they are effective and\nI'll review a little bit\nof the data in detail, they're effective,\nbut it's not that they're\nuniquely special for learning.\nIt's just that they can\nhelp some people bring\ntheir brain into the state that\nallows them to learn better.\nSo there are a lot of studies\nthat allowed us to arrive,\nor I should say allowed\nthe field to arrive\non these parameters of slow, slow,\nlow frequency waves are going to\nbring you into relaxed states,\nhigh frequency waves\ninto more alert states.\nThere's very good evidence\nfor anxiety reduction\nfrom the use of binaural beats.\nAnd what's interesting is\nanxiety reduction seems\nto be most effective\nwhen the binaural beats\nare bringing the brain into delta,\nso those slow big waves like\nsleep, theta and alpha states.\nAnd I'll link to a couple of these studies\nalthough I will probably\nlink more to the list\nthat really segregates them out one by one\nso you can see them all\nnext to one another.\nThere's good evidence that binaural beats\ncan be used to treat pain, chronic pain.\nThere's three studies in\npeer-reviewed journals\nwhich I took a look at, and\nthey seem to be of good quality,\nnot sponsored research, as we say,\nnot paid for by any specific company.\nBinaural beats have been shown\nto modestly improve cognition,\nattention, working memory\nand even creativity.\nBut the real boost from\nbinaural beats appears\nto be for anxiety reduction\nand pain reduction.\nSome people might find these beneficial\nfor these oral surgeries, right?\nBelieve it or not, there are people\nwho would rather have\nthe entire root canal\nor cavity drilled without Novocaine.\nAnd that's because they\nsometimes have a syringe phobia\nor something of that sort\nor they just don't like being\nnumb from the Novocaine,\nor maybe there's an\nunderlying medical reason.\nBut I think most people\ndo don't enjoy getting\ntheir teeth drilled even if\nthey have Novocaine in there\nor a root canal.\nAnd so it seems that binaural\nbeats can be effective\nin that environment.\nAnd you don't have to go\ninto that sort of extreme environment\nto benefit from binaural beats.\nBinaural beats are a either\nrelatively inexpensive thing\nto access, most of the apps\nare pretty inexpensive.\nI don't have a favorite binaural beats app\nto recommend to you.\nI confess I did use binaural\nbeats a few years ago.\nI shifted over to other what I call NSDR,\nnon-sleep deep rest\nprotocols in favor of those,\nbut many people like binaural beats\nand say that they benefit from them,\nespecially while studying or learning.\nI think part of the\nreason for that relates\nto the ability to channel our focus\nwhen we have some background noise.\nAnd this is something I\nalso get asked about a lot.\nIs it better to listen to\nmusic and have background noise\nwhen studying or is it better\nto have complete silence?\nWell, there's actually\na quite good literature\non this as well, but not\nso much as it relates\nto binaural beats, but\nrather whether or not people\nare listening to music, so-called\nwhite noise, brown noise;\nbelieve it or not, there's white noise\nand there's brown noise,\nthere's even pink noise\nand how that impacts brain states\nthat allow us to learn\ninformation better or not.\nSo now I'd like to talk about white noise\nand I want to be very\nclear that white noise\nhas been shown to really enhance\nbrain states for learning\nin certain individuals,\nin particular, in adults.\nBut white noise actually can\nhave a detrimental effect\non auditory learning and\nmaybe even the development\nof the auditory system\nin very young children\nin particular in infants.\nSo first I'd like to talk\nabout the beneficial effects\nof white noise on learning.\nThere are some really\nexcellent studies on this.\nThe first one that I'd like\nto just highlight is one that's entitled:\nLow Intensity White Noise\nImproves Performance\nin Auditory Working Memory\nTask, an fMRI Study.\nThis is a study that explored\nwhether or not learning could be enhanced\nby playing white noise in the background.\nBut the strength of the\nstudy is that they looked\nat some of the underlying neural circuitry\nand the activation of the neural circuitry\nin these people as they\ndid the learning task.\nAnd what it, essentially, illustrates\nis that white noise,\nprovided that white noise\nis of low enough intensity,\nmeaning not super loud,\nnot imperceptible, so not so\nquiet that you can't hear it,\nbut not super loud either,\nit actually could enhance\nlearning to a significant degree.\nAnd this has been shown now\nfor a huge number of\ndifferent types of learning.\nThere's a terrific article as well\nin a somewhat obscure journal, at least,\nobscure to me, which is:\nThe Effects of Noise Exposure\non Cognitive Performance\nand Brain Activity Patterns.\nThat's a study involving 54 subjects.\nThey, basically, were\nevaluated for mental workload\nand attention under different\nlevels of noise exposure,\nbackground noise and\ndifferent, essentially,\nloudness of noise.\nAnd the reason I like this\nstudy is that they looked\nat different levels of\nnoise and types of noise,\nand they varied a number\nof different things,\nas opposed to just doing a two-condition,\neither white noise or no\nwhite noise type thing.\nAnd what they found, again, is\nthat provided the white noise\nis not extremely loud,\nit could really enhance brain function\nfor sake of learning any number\nof different kinds of information.\nNow that's all great, but\nit really doesn't get to\nthe deeper guts of mechanism.\nAnd as a neuroscientist,\nwhat I really want to see\nis not just that something has an effect.\nThat's always nice.\nIt's always nice to see in\na nice peer-reviewed study\nwithout any kind of commercial biases\nthat there's an effect, binaural\nbeats can enhance learning\nor listening to white noise, not too loud\ncan enhance learning.\nBut you really want to\nunderstand mechanism\nbecause once you understand mechanism,\nnot only does it start to make sense,\nbut you can also imagine ways in which\nyou could develop better\ntools and protocols.\nSo I was very relieved to find,\nor I should say excited to\nfind this study published\nin the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,\nthis is a 2014 paper, White\nNoise Improves Learning\nby Modulating Activity in\nDopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions\nand Right Superior Temporal Sulcus.\nNow I don't expect you to know\nwhat the right spirit temporal sulcus is.\nI don't expect you to know\nwhat the dopamine midbrain\nregion is, but if you're like me,\nyou probably took highlighted notice\nof the word dopaminergic.\nDopamine is a neuromodulator,\nmeaning it's a chemical\nthat's released in our brain and body,\nbut mostly in our brain that modulates,\nmeaning controls the likelihood\nthat certain brain areas will be active\nand other brain areas won't be active.\nAnd dopamine is associated\nwith motivation.\nDopamine is associated with craving.\nMotivation is associated with\nall sorts of different things,\nincluding movement but what\nthis study so nicely shows\nis that white noise can really enhance\nthe activity of neurons in what's called\nthe substantia nigra VTA.\nThe substantia nigra VTA is a\nvery rich source of dopamine\nand that's because it's\nvery chockablock full\nof dopamine neurons.\nIt's an area of the\nbrain that is, perhaps,\nthe richest source of dopamine neurons.\nAnd you actually can see this brain region\nunder the microscope if\nyou take a slice of brain\nor you look at a brain\nwithout even staining it\nfor any proteins or dopamine or anything.\nIt's two very dark regions\nat the bottom of the brain.\nAnd the reason it's\ncalled substantia nigra,\nnigra meaning dark is\nbecause the dopamine neurons\nactually make something that\nmakes those neurons dark.\nAnd so you've got these\ntwo regions down there,\nthat contain dopamine\nand can release dopamine\nand, essentially, activate\nother brain regions\nand activate our sense of motivation\nand activate our sense of desire\nto continue focusing and learning.\nBut you can't just snap your fingers\nand make them release dopamine.\nYou actually have to trigger\ndopamine release from them.\nNow that trigger can be\ncaused by being very excited\nabout something or the fact\nthat that thing gave you\na lot of pleasure in the past,\nor you're highly motivated\nby fear or desire.\nBut what's so interesting\nto me is that it appears\nthat white noise itself can\nraise what we call the basal,\nthe baseline levels of dopamine\nthat are being released\nfrom this area, the substantia nigra.\nSo now we're starting to\nget a more full picture\nof how particular sounds\nin our environment\ncan increase learning.\nAnd that's, in part, I believe,\nthrough the release of\ndopamine from substantia nigra.\nSo I'm not trying to shift\nyou away from binaural beats,\nif that's your thing, but it does appear\nthat turning on white noise\nat a low level, not too loud.\nYou may say, \"Well, how loud?\"\nAnd I'll tell you in a moment,\nbut not too loud can\nallow you to learn better\nbecause of the ways that it's modulating\nyour brain chemistry.\nSo how loud or how soft\nshould that white noise be\nwhile you learn?\nWell, in these studies,\nit seemed that white noise\nthat could be heard by the person,\nso it wasn't imperceptible to them,\nso it was loud enough that they\ncould hear, but not so loud\nthat they felt it was intrusive\nor irritating to them.\nSo that's going to differ\nfrom person to person\nbecause people have different levels\nof auditory sensitivity.\nIt's going to depend\non age, going to depend\non a number of different factors.\nSo I can't tell you turn to level two\non your volume controller.\nThat's just not going to work.\nAlso, I don't know how far you are\nfrom a given speaker in the room\nor if you've got earphones in your head\nor you've got speakers in the room\nor if it's coming out of your computer.\nI don't know those things.\nSo what you're going\nto have to do is adjust\nthat white noise to the place\nwhere it's not interfering\nwith your ability to focus,\nbut rather it's enhancing\nyour ability to focus.\nI think a good rule of thumb\nis going to be to put it\nprobably on the lower third\nof any kind of volume dial,\nas opposed to in the upper third,\nwhere it would really be blasting.\nAnd really blasting any\nnoise, frankly, is not good,\nbut that's especially not good,\nmeaning it's especially bad\nif you have headphones in.\nI do want to mention\nsomething about headphones\nbefore I talk about white noise\nin the developmental context\nand why it can be dangerous there.\nWhen you put headphones in your ears,\nit has this incredible\neffect of making the sounds\nlike they come from inside your head,\nnot from out in the room.\nAnd now that might seem\nlike kind of a duh,\nbut that's actually really amazing, right?\nYour brain assumes that the sounds\nare coming from inside your head,\nas opposed from the environment\nthat you're in the moment\nyou put headphones in.\nSo if you're listening to an audiobook\nor maybe you're listening to\nthis podcast with headphones,\nthat's very different\nthan when you're listening\nto something out in the room\nand there are other sounds,\nother sound waves, especially if you use\nthese noise-cancellation headphones.\nSo if you're going to use\nwhite noise to enhance studying\nor learning of any\nkind, this also could be\nfor skill-learning, motor skill-learning\nwhile you're exercising,\nmy suggestion would be\nthat if you're using headphones,\nto keep it quite low.\nThis is an effect on the\nmidbrain dopamine neurons\nthat's a background effect of raising\nthe baseline of dopamine release.\nThe way that dopamine neurons\nfires, they're always firing;\nyours are firing right now, so are mine,\nwhen something exciting\nhappens, they fire a lot.\nAnd when something disappointing happens,\nthat firing, the release of dopamine\ngoes down below baseline.\nWhat you're talking about here is raising\nyour overall levels of\nattention and motivation,\nwhich translate to better learning\nby just tickling those\nneurons a little bit,\nraising the baseline firing.\nYou're not turning up the white noise\nto the point where you're feeling amazing.\nThis isn't like turning\non your favorite song.\nThis is actually the opposite.\nThis is about getting that\nbaseline up just a bit.\nSo I recommend turning\nthe volume up just a bit\nso that you can focus entirely on the task\nthat you're trying to do.\nAnd, of course, you've\nturned on white noise\nso your attention might\ndrift to that for a moment.\nIs it too loud? Is it too soft?\nIf you can disappear into\nthe work, so to speak,\nif your attention can\ndisappear into the work,\nthen that's probably sufficiently quiet.\nAnd for those of you that say,\nwell, I like really loud music\nand if I just blast the music,\nthen I forget about the music.\nI don't suggest blasting music.\nAnd this is coming from somebody\nwho really likes loud music.\nI grew up with kind of a\nloud fast rules mentality,\nand if you don't know what\nloud fast rules means,\nthen I can't help you, but\nthere's a time and a place,\nperhaps, to listen to music loud\nbut, especially, with headphones,\nyou can trigger, excuse me,\nhearing loss quite rapidly.\nAnd unfortunately,\nbecause these hair cells\nthat we talked about earlier,\nour central nervous system\nneurons, they do not regenerate,\nthey do not come back.\nNow along the lines of hearing loss,\nI should just say that the best way\nto blow out your hearing for good,\nto eliminate your hearing\nis to have very loud sounds\nsuper imposed on a loud environment.\nSo loud environments can\ncause hearing loss over time.\nSo if you work at a construction\nsite, clanging really loud,\nor if you work the sound\nboard in a club or something,\nyou are headed towards hearing loss\nunless you protect your hearing\nwith earplugs and headphones.\nNowadays, some of the ear\nplugs are very low profile,\nmeaning you can't see them.\nSo that's kind of nice,\nso you're not like the,\nwhen I was younger, like you\ndidn't want to be the dork\nto go to the concert with the earplugs,\nbut it turns out those dorks were smarter\nthan everybody else,\nbecause they're not the ones\nwho are craning their neck to\ntry and hear trivial things\nat the age of 30 or so 'cause\nthey blew out their hearing.\nSo if you are working\nin a loud environment\nor you expose yourselves\nto a loud environment,\nyou really want to avoid big inflections\nin sound above that.\nSo loud environment plus fireworks,\nloud environment plus gunshot,\nloud environments plus very\nhigh-frequency intense sound,\nthat's what we call the two-hit model,\nthis is also true for concussion,\nthat you can take a stimulus that normally\nwould be below the threshold of injury,\nyou add another stimulus at the same time,\nthat would be below the\nthreshold of injury.\nAnd then, suddenly,\nyou killed the neurons.\nSo I don't want to make people paranoid,\nbut you do want to protect your hearing.\nIt's no fun to lose your hearing.\nIf you're going to use\nheadphones and you feel\nlike you want to crank it up all the way,\njust remember that the\nmore that you can get\nout of a lower volume, meaning the longer\nthat you can go listening\nto things at lower volume,\nthe longer you'll be able to\nhear that music or that thing.\nSo again, I'm not the hearing cop.\nThat's not my job, but\nas somebody who's lost\nsome of his high-frequency hearing,\nI can tell you it's not a pleasure.\nThe old argument that it\nhelps you not have to hear\nor listen to people that\nyou don't want to listen to,\nthat does it doesn't really work.\nThey just send you text messages instead.\nSo what about white noise and\nhearing loss in development?\nI know a lot of people with children\nhave these noise machines like sound waves\nand things like that,\nthat help the kids sleep.\nAnd look, I think kids getting good sleep\nand parents getting good sleep is vital\nto physical and mental\nhealth and family health.\nSo I certainly sympathize\nwith those needs.\nHowever, there are data that indicate\nthat white noise during development\ncan be detrimental to the auditory system.\nI don't want to frighten any parents\nif you played white noise to your kids,\nthis doesn't mean that\ntheir auditory system\nor their speech patterns\nare going to be disrupted\nor that their interpretation of speech\nis going to be disrupted forever.\nBut there are data published\nin the journal, Science,\nand Science being one of\nthe three, APEX Journal,\nScience, Nature, Cell, the\nmost stringent journals,\ndata published in the journal,\nScience, some years ago,\nactually by a scientist\nwho I know quite well,\nhis name is Edward Chang,\nhe's a medical doctor now,\nhe's a neurosurgeon, he's actually\nthe chair of neurosurgery at UCSF\nand he runs a laboratory where\nthey study auditory learning,\nneuroplasticity, et cetera,\nhe and his mentor at the time,\nMike Merzenich published a paper showing\nthat if young animals and\nthis was in animal models\nwere exposed to white noise, so [shushing]\nthe very type of noise that\nI'm saying as a older person,\nand when I say older,\nI mean, somebody who's\nin their late teens, early 20s and older\ncould benefit from listening\nto that at a low level\nin the background for sake of learning,\nwell, they exposed very young\nanimals to this white noise,\nit actually disrupted the\nmaps of the auditory world\nwithin the brain.\nAnd we haven't talked\nabout these maps yet,\nbut I want to take a\nmoment and talk about them\nand explain this effect and\nwhat it might mean for you\nif you have kids or if you were exposed\nto a lot of white noise early on.\nSo auditory information goes\nup into our cortex, into these,\nessentially, the outside\nportion of our brain\nthat's responsible for all\nour higher level cognition\nand our planning, our\ndecision-making, et cetera,\ncreativity and up there,\nwe have what are called tonotopic maps.\nWhat's a tonotopic map?\nWell, remember the\ncochlea, how it's coiled\nand at one end, it responds\nto high frequencies\nand the other end, it\nresponds to low frequencies?\nLike a piano, the keys sound different\nas you extend down and up the piano keys.\nAnd it's organized in\na very systematic way.\nIt's not all intermixed high frequencies\nand low frequencies.\nIt's organized in a very systematic way\nfrom one end to the other.\nYour visual system is in,\nwhat's called a retinotopic map.\nSo neighboring points in\nspace off to my right,\nlike my two fingers off to my right\nare mapped to neighboring\npoints in space in my brain.\nAnd that space right in front of me\nis mapped to a different\nlocation in my brain,\nbut it's systematic, it's regular.\nIt's not random. It's not salt and pepper.\nIt goes from high to low or\nfrom right to center to left.\nIn the auditory system,\nwe have what are called tonotopic maps,\nwhere frequency, high\nfrequency to low frequency\nand everything in between is organized\nin a very systematic way.\nNow our experience of life from the time\nwe're a baby until the time\nthat we die is not systematic.\nWe don't hear low frequencies\nat one part of the room\nor at one part of the\nday and high frequencies\nis another part of the room\nand other part of the day,\nthey're all intermixed.\nBut if you remember, the\ncochlea separates them out.\nJust like a prism of light separates out\nthe different wavelengths of light,\nthe cochlea separates out\nthe different frequencies.\nAnd the developing brain takes\nthose separated out frequencies\nand learns this relationship\nbetween itself, meaning the\nchild and the outside world.\nWhite noise, essentially contains\nno tonotopic information.\nThe frequencies are all intermixed.\nIt's just noise.\nWhereas when I speak, my voice has,\nnow I'm getting technical,\nbut it has what's called\na certain envelope, meaning\nit has some low frequencies\nand some slightly higher frequency.\nLike I might a voice higher,\nalthough I'm not very good at that.\nMy voice starts to crack and\nI can make my voice lower,\nalthough not as low as Costello's snore.\nSo it has an envelope, it has a container.\nWhite noise has no container.\nIt's like all the colors of the\nrainbow spread out together,\nwhich is actually what you\nget when you get white light\nwhite noise is analogous to white light.\nSo one of the reasons why\nhearing a lot of white noise\nduring development for\nlong periods of time can be\ndetrimental to the development\nof the auditory system\nis that these tonotopic\nmaps don't form normally;\nat least, they don't in\nexperimental animals.\nNow, the reason I'm raising this\nis that many people I know, in particular,\nfriends who have small children, they say,\n\"I want to use a white\nnoise machine while I sleep.\nBut is it okay for my baby to\nuse a white noise machine?\"\nAnd I consulted with various\npeople, scientists about this.\nAnd they said, \"Well,\nthe baby is also hearing\nthe parent's voices and is hearing music\nand it's hearing the dog bark.\nSo it's not the only\nthing they're hearing.\"\nHowever, every single person\nthat I consulted with said,\n\"But there's neuroplasticity during sleep.\nThat's when the kid is sleeping.\nAnd I don't know that you'd\nwant to expose a child\nto white noise the entire night,\nbecause it might degrade\nthat tonotopic map.\"\nIt might not destroy it.\nIt might not eliminate it,\nbut it could make it a little less clear,\nlike taking the keys on the piano\nand taping a few of them together, right?\nSo you still got the highs and\nlows in the appropriate order\nand everything in between.\nBut when you take the keys together,\nyou don't get the same fidelity.\nYou don't get the same\nprecision of the noise\nthat comes out of that piano.\nSo, again, I don't want to scare anybody,\nbut I would say if you are in a position\nto make the choice of\neither using white noise\nor something similar, pink\nnoise is just a variation.\nIt's got a little bit more\nof a certain frequency,\njust like pink light has a little bit more\nof a certain wavelength than white light.\nIf you are in a position to make choices\nabout things, to put in a young,\nespecially very young\nchild's sleeping environment,\nwhite noise might be something\nto consider avoiding.\nAgain, I'm not telling you what to do,\nbut it's something to\nperhaps consider avoiding.\nI don't think most pediatricians\nare going to be aware of these data,\nbut if you talk to any\nauditory physiologists\nor an audiologist or somebody\nwho studies auditory development,\nI'm fairly certain that they\nwould have opinions about that.\nNow, whether or not their\nopinions agree with mine\nand these folks that I\nconsulted with or not\nis a separate matter.\nI don't know, cause I don't know them,\nbut it's something that I\nfelt was important enough\nto cue you to, especially\nsince I've highlighted,\nexcuse me, the opposite\neffect is true in adulthood.\nOnce your auditory system has formed,\nonce it's established\nthese tonotopic maps,\nthen the presence of\nbackground white noise\nshould not be a problem at all.\nIn fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all\nbecause you're also not attending to it.\nThe idea is that it's playing\nat a low enough volume\nthat you forget it in the background\nand that it's supporting learning\nby bringing your brain into a\nheightened state of alertness\nand, especially, this\nheightened state of dopamine,\ndopaminergic activation of the brain,\nwhich will make it easier to learn faster\nand easier to learn the information.\nSo now I want to talk\nabout auditory learning\nand actually how you can get better\nat learning information that you hear,\nnot just information\nthat you see on a page\nor motor skill learning.\nThere are a lot of reasons\nto want to do this.\nA lot of classroom teaching,\nwhether or not it's by Zoom\nor in-person is auditory in nature.\nNot everything is necessarily\nwritten down for us.\nIt's also good to get better\nat listening or so I'm told.\nSo there's a phenomenon called\nthe cocktail party effect.\nNow, even if you've never\nbeen to a cocktail party,\nyou've experienced and participated\nin what's called the\ncocktail party effect.\nThe cocktail party effect is where you are\nin an environment that's rich with sound,\nmany sound waves coming\nfrom many different sources,\nmany different things,\nso in a city, in a classroom,\nin a car that contains people\nhaving various conversations,\nyou somehow need to be able to\nattend to specific components\nof those sound waves, meaning you need\nto hear certain people and not others.\nThe reason it's called\nthe cocktail party effect\nis that you and meaning your brain\nare exquisitely good at creating\na cone of auditory attention,\na narrow band of attention\nwith which you can extract\nthe information you care about\nand wipe away or erase all the rest.\nNow this takes work, it takes attention.\nOne of the reasons why\nyou might come home from\na loud gathering, maybe\na stadium, a sports event\nor a cocktail party, for that matter,\nand feel just exhausted is\nbecause if you were listening\nto conversations there or trying to listen\nto those conversations\nwhile watching the game\nand people moving past you\nand hearing all this noise,\nclinking of glasses, et cetera,\nit takes attentional effort\nand the brain uses up\na lot of energy just at rest,\nbut it uses up even more energy\nwhen you are paying strong\nattention to something,\nliterally caloric energy\nburning up things like glucose,\net cetera, even if you're\nketogenic, it's burning up energy.\nSo the cocktail party effect\nhas been studied extensively\nin the field of\nneuroscience and we now know\nat a mechanistic level,\nhow one accomplishes\nthis feat of attending to certain sounds,\ndespite the fact that\nwe are being bombarded\nwith all sorts of other sounds.\nSo there are a couple\nways that we do this.\nFirst of all, much as\nwith our visual system,\nwe can expand or contract\nour visual field of view,\nso we can go from panoramic vision,\nsee the entire scene that we\nare in by dilating our gaze,\ntalked a lot about this on\nthis podcast and elsewhere.\nWe can, for instance, keep\nour head and eyes stationary\nor mostly stationary, you don't\nhave to be rigid about it,\nand you can expand your field of view\nso you can see the walls\nand ceiling and floor,\ncan see yourself in the\nenvironment, that's panoramic view.\nIt's what you would accomplish\nwithout having to try at all\nif you went to a horizon, for instance,\nor we can contract our field of view,\nI can bring my focus to\na particular location,\nwhat we call a vergence point,\ndirectly in front of me.\nNow I'm pointing at the camera\ndirectly in front of me.\nWe can do that, we can expand and contract\nour visual field of view.\nWell, we can expand and contract\nour auditory field of view,\nso to speak, our auditory window.\nYou can try this next time\nyou are in an environment\nthat's rich with noise, meaning\nlots of different sounds.\nYou can just tune out all the\nnoise to a background chatter.\nYou try not focus on\nany one particular sound\nand you get the background\nchatter of noise.\nAnd you'll find that it's\nactually very relaxing\nin comparison to trying\nto listen to somebody\nat a cocktail party or\nshouting back and forth.\nNow, if you're very, very\ninterested in that person,\nor getting to know them better\nor what they're telling you,\nor some combination of those things,\nthen you'll be very motivated to do it\nbut nonetheless, it requires energy\nand effort and attention.\nHow do we do this?\nWell, it's actually quite simple\nor, at least, it's simple, in essence,\nalthough the underlying\nmechanisms are complex.\nHere, I have to credit the laboratory\nof a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R,\nup at the University of\nOregon who essentially\nfigured out that we are able to accomplish\nthis extraction of particular sounds.\nWe can really hear one person\nor a small number of people\namidst a huge background of chatter\nbecause we pay attention\nto the onset of words,\nbut also to the offset of words.\nNow, the way to visualize this\nis if the background noise\nis just like a bunch of waves of noise,\nit's literally just sound\nwaves coming every frequency,\nlow frequency, high frequency,\nglasses clinking together.\nIf you've got a game, people are shouting,\npeople are talking on their phone,\nthere's the crack of the ball,\nif somebody actually\nmanages to hit the ball,\nthe announcer, et cetera,\nbut whatever we were paying attention to,\nwe set up a cone of auditory attention,\na tunnel of auditory attention,\nwhere we are listening\nalthough we don't realize\nit, we are listening\nfor the onset and the\noffset of those words.\nNow this is powerful\nfor a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, it's a call\nto arms, so to speak,\nto disengage your auditory system\nwhen you don't need to\nfocus your attention\non something particular.\nSo if you are somebody,\nyou're coming home from work,\nyou've had a very long day\nand you're trying to make out\na particular conversation\non background noise,\nyou might consider just not\nhaving that conversation,\njust letting your auditory\nlandscape be very broad,\nalmost like panoramic vision.\nIf you're trying to learn how\nto extract sound information,\nit could be notes of music,\nit could be scales of music,\nit could be words spoken by somebody else,\nmaybe somebody is telling\nyou what you need to say\nfor a particular speech or the information\nthat you need to learn\nfor a particular topic,\nand they're telling it to you,\ndeliberately paying\nattention both to the onset\nand to the offset of those\nwords can be beneficial\nbecause it is exactly the way\nthat the auditory system likes\nto bring in information.\nSo one of the more common phenomenon\nthat I think we all experience\nis you go to a party\nor you meet somebody new and you say hi,\nI would say, \"Hi, I'm Andrew.\"\nAnd they'd say, \"Hi,\nI'm Jeff,\" for instance.\n\"Great to meet you.\"\nAnd then a minute later, I\ncan't remember the guy's name.\nNow, is it because I don't\ncare what his name is?\nNo, somehow the presence\nof other auditory information interfered.\nIt's not that my mind was\nnecessarily someplace else.\nIt's that the signal-to-noise\nas we say wasn't high enough.\nSomehow the way he said it or\nthe way it landed on my ears,\nwhich is really all that matters,\nwhen it comes down to\nlearning, is such that\nit just didn't achieve high\nenough signal-to-noise.\nThe noise was too high\nor the signal was too low\nor some combination of those.\nSo the next time you ask somebody's name,\nremember listen to the\nonset of what they say\nand the offset.\nSo it would be paying\nattention to the j in Jeff\nand it would be paying\nattention to that in f in F,\nin Jeff, excuse me.\nAnd chances are, you'll be\nable to remember that name.\nNow, I don't know if people\nwho are super learners\nof names do this naturally or not.\nI don't have access to their brains.\nI don't think they're\ngoing to give me access\nto their brains either.\nBut it's a very interesting\nway to take the natural biology\nof auditory attention and\nlearning and apply it to scenarios\nwhere you're trying to\nremember either people's names\nor specific information.\nNow, I do acknowledge that\ntrying to learn every word\nin a sentence by paying attention\nto its onset and offset\ncould actually be disruptive\nto the learning process.\nSo this would be more\nfor specific attention,\nlike you're asking directions\nin a city and somebody says,\nokay, you say you're\nlost and they say, okay,\nyou're going to go two blocks down,\nyou're going to turn left.\nAnd then you're going to see\na landmark on your right.\nAnd then you're going to go in\nthe third door on your left.\nThat's a lot of information,\nat least, for me.\nSo the way you would\nwant to listen to that\nis you're going to go down the road.\nSee, I already forgot.\nYou're going to go left and\nyou're just going to program\nand instead of just hearing the word left,\nyou're going to think the L at\nthe front of left and the T.\nYou're going to left, okay.\nSo you're coding in specific words.\nAnd what this does is this hijacks\nthese naturally-occurring\nattention mechanisms\nthat the auditory system likes to use.\nSo a little bit of data\nthat for auditory encoding,\nthis kind of thing can be beneficial.\nThere are a lot of data that attention\nfor auditory coding is beneficial.\nThere are a little bit of data showing\nthat deliberately encoding\nauditory information this way,\nmeaning trying to learn\nauditory information this way\ncan be beneficial or\ncan accelerate learning.\nAnd some of these features\nof what I'm describing here,\nmap onto some of the work that\nof Mike Merzenich and others\nthat have been designed\nto try and overcome things\nlike stutter and to treat various forms\nof auditory learning disorders.\nBut more importantly,\nand perhaps more powerful\nis the work of Mike\nMerzenich that was done\nwith his then graduate\nstudent, Gregg Recanzone\nthat showed that, using\nthe attentional system,\nwe can actually learn much faster\nand we can actually\nactivate neuroplasticity\nin the adult brain, something\nthat's very challenging to do.\nAnd that the auditory system\nis one of the main ways\nin which we can access\nneuroplasticity more broadly.\nSo I just want to take a couple of minutes\nand describe the work of\nRecanzone and Merzenich,\nbecause it's absolutely\nfantastic and fascinating.\nWhat they did is they had subjects try\nto learn auditory information,\nexcept that they told\nthem to pay attention\nto particular frequencies.\nSo now you know what frequencies are\nso, essentially, high-pitched\nsounds or low-pitched sounds.\nWhat they found was\njust passively listening\nto a bunch of stuff does not\nallow the brain to change\nand for that stuff to\nbe remembered at all.\nThat's not a surprise.\nWe've all experienced the phenomenon\nof having someone talk and\nwe see their mouth moving\nand we're like, yeah,\nthis is really important,\nthis is really important.\nWe're listening. We're trying to listen.\nAnd then they walk away and we think\nI didn't get any of that.\nAnd you wonder whether or not it was them,\nmaybe this is happening to you right now.\nYou wonder whether or not it was you,\nyou wonder whether or not you\nhave trouble with learning\nor you have attention deficit.\nIt could be any number\nof different things.\nBut what Recanzone and\nMerzenich discovered\nwas that if you instruct\nsubjects to listen\nfor particular cues within\nspeech, or within sounds,\nthat not only can you learn\nthose things more quickly,\nbut that you can remap these\ntonotopic maps in the cortex\nthat I referred to earlier.\nYou actually get changes\nin the neural architecture,\nthe neural circuitry in the brain,\nand this can occur not only very rapidly,\nbut they can occur in the adult brain,\nwhich prior to their work was not thought\nto be amenable to change.\nIt was long thought that neuroplasticity\ncould only occur in the developing brain,\nbut the work of Recanzone and Merzenich\nin the auditory system\nactually was some of the first\nthat really opened up\neverybody's eyes and ears\nto the idea that the brain\ncan change in adulthood.\nSo here's how this sort\nof process would work\nand how you might apply it.\nIf you are trying to learn music,\nor you're trying to learn information\nthat you're going to then recite,\nyou can decide to highlight certain words\nor certain frequencies of sound\nor certain scales or\ncertain keys on the piano,\nand to only focus on those\nfor certain learning bouts.\nSo I'll give an example\nthat's real time for me,\nmeaning it's happening right now.\nI know generally what I want\nto say when I arrive here,\nI even know specifically certain things\nthat I want to make\nsure get across to you,\nbut I don't think about every single word\nthat I'm going to say\nand the precise order\nin which I'm going to say those things.\nThat would be actually very disruptive\nbecause it wouldn't match\nmy normal patterns of speech\nand you'd probably think I\nwas sounding rather robotic\nif I were to do that.\nSo one way that we can\nremember information\nis as we write out, for instance,\nsomething that we want to say,\nwe can highlight particular\nwords, we can underline those.\nIf we're listening to somebody\nand they're telling us information,\nwe can decide just to\nhighlight particular words\nthat they said to us and write those down.\nNow, of course, we're listening\nto all the information,\nbut the work of Recanzone and Merzenich\nand the work of others in\naddition to his former student\nor former post-doc, I don't know which,\nMichael Kilgard who's now\ngot his own lab down in Texas\nor others have shown that\nthe cuing of attention\nto particular features of speech,\nparticular components of speech,\nthe way in which it increases\nour level of attention overall\nallows us to capture more\nof the information overall.\nAnd so I don't want this\nto be abstract at all.\nWhat this means is when you're listening,\nyou don't have to listen to every word.\nYou're already listening to every word.\nAll the information is\ncoming in through your ears.\nWhat you're trying to\nextract is particular things\nor themes within the content.\nSo maybe you decide if\nyou're listening to me\nthat you're only going to\nlisten to the word tools,\nor you're only going to listen\nto when my voice goes above background,\nyou get to decide what you\ndecide to listen to or not.\nAnd what you decide to\nfocus on isn't necessarily\nas important as the fact\nthat you're focusing.\nSo I hope that's clear.\nThe auditory system does this all the time\nwith the cocktail party effect.\nWhat I'm talking about is\nexporting certain elements\nof the mechanisms of the\ncocktail party effect,\npaying attention to the\nonset and offset of words\nor particular notes within\nmusic or particular scales,\nor you can make it even\nbroader and particular motifs\nof music or particular sentences of words\nor particular phrases.\nAnd in doing that, you extract more\nof the information overall,\neven though you're not paying attention\nto all the information at once.\nNow, I'd like to talk about a phenomenon\nthat you've all experienced\nbefore, which is called Doppler.\nSo the Doppler effect is the\nway that we experience sound\nwhen the thing that's\nmaking that sound is moving.\nThe simplest way to explain\nthis is to translate the sound\ninto the visual world once again.\nSo if you've ever seen a\nduck or a goose sitting\nin a pond or a lake and\nit's bobbing up and down,\nwhat you'll notice is\nthat the ripples of water\nthat extend out from that duck or goose\nare fairly regularly\nspaced in all directions.\nAnd that's because that\nduck or goose is stationary.\nIt's moving up and down,\nbut it's not moving forward\nor backward or to the side.\nNow, if that duck or\ngoose were to swim forward\nby paddling its little webbed\nfeet under the surface,\nyou would immediately notice\nthat the ripples of water\nthat are close to and in\nfront of that duck or goose\nwould be closer together than\nthe ones that trailed it,\nthat were behind.\nAnd that is essentially what\nhappens with sound as well.\nWith the Doppler effect,\nwe experience sounds\nthat are closer to us at higher frequency,\nthe ripples are closer together,\nand sounds that are further\naway at lower frequency,\nespecially when they're moving past us.\nSo if you've ever, for\ninstance, heard a siren\nin the distance, [humming]\nthat's essentially my\nrendition of a siren,\nI don't know what ambulance\nor police or what,\npassing you on a street,\nthat is the Doppler effect.\nThe Doppler effect is one of the main ways\nthat we make out the direction\nthat things are arriving\nfrom and their speeds and trajectories.\nAnd we get very good,\nfrom a very young age,\nat discerning what direction\nthings are arriving from\nand the direction that they\nare going to pass us in.\nAnd the Doppler effect has probably saved\nyour life many, many times.\nIn this way, you just don't realize it\nbecause you'll step off the curb\nor you're driving your car\nand you pull to the side\nso that the ambulance\nor firetruck can go by\nbecause you heard that\nsiren off in the distance,\nand then you pull away from the curb\nand you get back on the road in part,\nbecause you don't see it any longer,\nbut also you don't hear any\nother sirens in the distance.\nNow, some animals such as\nbats are exquisitely good\nat navigating their\nenvironments according to sound.\nNow, we've all heard that bats don't see.\nThat's actually not true.\nThey actually have vision,\nbut they just rely more heavily\non their auditory system.\nAnd the way that bats navigate in the dark\nand the way that bats navigate using sound\nis through Doppler.\nNow, they don't simply listen\nto whether or not things\nare coming at them or\nmoving away from them\nand pay attention to the\nDoppler like the siren example\nI gave for you.\nWhat they do is they\ngenerate their own sounds.\nSo a bat, as it flies around\nis sending out clicks,\n[Andrew clicks tongue]\nI think that's my best\nbat sound or maybe it's\n[Andrew clicks tongue]\nand they're clicking, they're\nactually propelling sound out\nat a particular frequency that they know.\nNow, whether or not they're\nconscious of it, I don't know.\nI've never asked them.\nAnd if I did ask them, I\ndon't think they could answer.\nAnd if they could answer,\nthey couldn't answer\nin a language that I could understand.\nBut the bat is essentially flying around,\nsending out sound waves,\npinging its environment\nwith sound waves of a particular frequency\nand then depending on the\nfrequency of sound waves\nthat come back, they know\nif they're getting closer\nto an object or further away from it.\nSo if they send out\nsounds at a frequency of,\nthis was much slower than\nit would actually occur,\nbut let's say one every\nhalf second, [whining]\nand it's coming back even faster [roars]\nthen they know they're getting closer\nbecause of the Doppler effect.\nAnd if it comes back more slowly,\nthey know that there's\nnothing in front of them.\nSo the bat is essentially\nnavigating its world\nby creating these auras of sound\nthat bounce back on to them\nfrom the various objects,\ntrees, et cetera,\nbuildings and people, it's\nkind of eerie to think about.\nBut yes, they see you, they\nexperience you with their sound,\nthey sense you and they're\nusing Doppler to accomplish it.\nNow I'd like to talk\nabout ringing in the ears.\nThis is something that\nI get asked about a lot.\nAnd speaking of signal-to-noise,\nI don't know if I get\nasked about it a lot,\nbecause many people suffer\nfrom ringing in their ears,\nor because the people\nwho suffer from ringing\nin their ears suffer so much\nthat they are more prone to ask.\nSo it could be a sampling\nbias, I don't know,\nbut I've been asked enough times\nand some of the experiences\nof discomfort that people have expressed\nabout having this ringing of the ears\nreally motivated me to go\ndeep into this literature.\nSo the ringing of the\nears that one experiences\nis called tinnitus, not\nti-nahy-tus, but tinnitus.\nAnd tinnitus can vary in intensity\nand it can vary according\nto stress levels,\nit can vary across the\nlifespan or even time of day.\nSo it's very subject to background effects\nand contextual effects.\nSo I think we all know\nthat we should do our best\nto maximize healthy sleep.\nWe did a number of episodes on that.\nEssentially, the first four episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwere all about sleep\nand how to get better sleep.\nWe all know that we should\ntry and limit our stress.\nAnd we had an episode about stress\nand ways to mitigate stress as well.\nHowever, there are people, it seems,\nthat are suffering from tinnitus,\nfor which stress or lack of sleep\njust can't explain the\npresence of the tinnitus.\nTinnitus can be caused by disruption\nto these hair cells that\nwe talked about earlier\nor damage to the hair cells.\nSo that's another reason why,\neven if you have good hearing now\nthat you want to protect that hearing\nand really avoid putting yourself\ninto these two-hit environments,\nenvironments where there's\na lot of background noise,\nand then you add another\nreally loud auditory stimulus.\nThis also can happen at different\ntimes, I should mention.\nIf you go to a concert or\nyou listen to loud music\nwith your headphones and\nthen you go to a concert,\nor you go into a very\nloud work environment,\nthe hair cells can still be vulnerable.\nAnd once those hair cells\nare knocked out, currently,\nwe don't have the\ntechnology to put them back.\nAlthough many groups,\nincluding some excellent groups\nat Stanford and elsewhere, too, of course,\nare working on ways to\nreplenish those hair cells\nand restore hearing.\nThere are treatments for tinnitus\nthat involve taking certain substances.\nThere are medications for tinnitus.\nIn the non-prescription landscape,\nwhich is typically what we\ndiscuss on this podcast,\nwhen we discuss taking anything,\nthere are, essentially, four compounds\nfor which there are\nquality peer-reviewed data,\nwhere there does not appear to\nbe any overt commercial bias,\nmeaning that nothing's\nreported in the papers\nas funding from a particular company\nand those are melatonin, Ginkgo\nbilboa, zinc and magnesium.\nNow I've talked about melatonin before.\nI'm personally not a fan of\nmelatonin as a sleep aid,\nbut there are four studies,\nfirst one entitled:\nThe Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus,\ntinnitus, excuse me, and Sleep.\nSecond one, Treatment of Central\nand Sensory Neural Tinnitus\nwith orally-administered melatonin.\nAnd then the title goes on much longer,\nbut it's a randomized study.\nI'm not going to read out all these.\nMelatonin: Can it Stop The ringing?\nwhich is an interesting\narticle, double-blinded study,\nand The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus.\nEach one of these studies\nhas anywhere from 30\nto more than 100 subjects,\nin one case 102 subjects;\nboth genders as they list them out,\ntypically, it's listed as\nsex, not gender in studies\nso it should say both\nsexes, but nonetheless;\nan age range anywhere from 30 years old,\nall the way up to 65 plus.\nI didn't see any studies\nof people younger than 30.\nAll three focused on\nmelatonin, not surprisingly,\nbecause of the titles, looking at a range\nof dosages anywhere from\nthree milligrams per day,\nwhich is sort of typical of\nmany supplements for melatonin,\nstill much higher than one\nwould manufacture endogenously\nthrough your own pineal gland,\nbut three milligrams in these studies\nfor a duration of anywhere from 30 days\nto much longer in some cases, six months.\nAnd all four of these studies found modest\nyet still statistically\nsignificant effects\nof taking melatonin by mouth,\nso it's orally-administered melatonin\nin reducing the severity of tinnitus.\nSo that's compelling, at least to me.\nIt doesn't sound like a cure.\nAnd, of course, as always,\nI'm not a physician,\nI'm a scientist, so I\ndon't prescribe anything.\nI only profess things, I\nreport to you the science.\nYou have to decide if\nmelatonin is right for you\nif you have tinnitus.\nAnd certainly, I say that\nboth to protect myself,\nbut also protect you.\nYou're responsible for\nyour health and wellbeing.\nAnd I'm not telling anyone to run out\nand start taking melatonin for tinnitus,\nbut it does seem that\nit can have some effects\nin reducing its symptoms.\nGinkgo Boaboa is an interesting compound.\nIt's been prescribed for or recommended\nfor many, many things, but\nthere are a few studies,\nagain, double-blinded studies\nlasting one to six months,\none that has have an\nimpressive number of subjects,\n978 subjects ranging from\nage 18 all the way up to 65\nso on and so forth that show\nnot huge effects of Ginkgo,\nbut as they quote,\nlimited evidence suggests\nthat if tinnitus is a side\neffect of something else,\nin particular, cognitive decline,\nso age-related tinnitus might\nbe helped by Ginkgo Boaboa.\nI won't go through all the\ndetails of the zinc studies,\nbut it seems that zinc supplementation\nat higher levels than are typical\nof most people's intakes\nof 50 milligrams per day,\ndo appear to be able to\nreduce subjective symptoms\nof tinnitus in most of the people\nthat took the supplemented zinc.\nThere aren't a lot of studies on that.\nSo I could only find one\ndouble-blinded study.\nIt lasted anywhere from one to six months,\n41 subjects, both genders\nlisted out again here, 45 to 64,\nand they saw a decrease in the\nseverity of tinnitus symptoms\nwith 50 milligrams of\nelemental zinc supplementation.\nAnd then last but not least\nis the magnesium study.\nAgain, only a single study.\nIt's a Phase II study looking\nat a fairly limited number of subjects,\nso only 19 subjects taking 532 milligrams\nof elemental magnesium.\nFor those of you that take magnesium,\nthere's magnesium and elemental magnesium,\nand it's always translated on the bottle,\nbut it was associated with\na lessening of symptoms\nrelated to tinnitus.\nSo for you tinnitus sufferers out there,\nyou may already be aware of this,\nyou may already be taking these things\nand had no positive effects,\nmeaning they didn't help, maybe not.\nI hope that you'll, at\nleast, consider these,\ntalk to your doctor about them.\nI do realize that tinnitus\nis extremely disruptive.\nI can't say I empathize because I don't,\nfrom a place of experience, that is,\nbecause I don't have tinnitus,\nbut for those of you that\ndon't include myself,\nyou can imagine that\nhearing sounds of things\nthat aren't there and\nthe ringing in one's ears\ncan be very disruptive and I\nthink would be very disruptive\nand explains why people with\ntinnitus reach out so often\nwith questions about\nhow to alleviate that.\nAnd I hope this information\nwas useful to you.\nI'd like to now talk about\nbalance and our sense of balance,\nwhich is controlled by, believe it or not,\nour ears and things in our ears,\nas well as by our brain and\nelements of our spinal cord.\nBut before I do that, I want\nto ask you another question\nor I would rather, I'd like\nto ask you to ask yourself\na question and answer it,\nwhich is how big are your ears.\nIt turns out that the\nears grow our entire life.\nIn the early stage of our\nlife, they grow more slowly.\nAnd then as we age,\nthey grow more quickly.\nYou may have noticed if\nyou have family members\nwho are well into their 70s and 80s,\nand if you're fortunate, into their 90s\nand maybe even 100s, is that the ears\nof some of these individuals\nget very, very big,\nrelative to their previous ear sizes.\nSo it turns out that biological age\ncan actually be measured\naccording to ear size.\nNow you have to take a few\nmeasurements but there's,\nbelieve it or not, there is a formula\nin the scientific literature,\nif you know your ear circumference,\nso the distance around\nyour ear, ears, plural,\npresumably you have two, most people do,\nin millimeters, so you're\ngoing to take the circumference\nof your ears in millimeters.\nHow would you do this?\nHow would you do this?\nMaybe you take a string and\nyou put it around your ear,\nand then you measure the string.\nThat's probably going to be\neasier than marching around\nyour ear or somebody\nelse's ear with a ruler\nand measuring in millimeters.\nSo what's your ear\ncircumference, on the outside,\ndon't go in on the divot or anything.\nYou're just going around\nas if you're going to trace\nthe closest fitting oval,\nassuming your ears are\noval, closest fitting oval\nthat matches your ear circumference.\nTake that number in\nmillimeters, subtract from it...\nOh, excuse me, I should do this correctly.\nDo that for both ears, add them together,\nadd those numbers together, divide by two,\nget the average for your two ears,\nget your average ear circumference,\nof course, your two ears.\nThen take that number in millimeters,\nsubtract 88.1 and then\nwhatever value that is,\nmultiply it times 1.96\nand that will tell you\nyour biological age.\nNow why in the world\nwould this be accurate?\nAs we age, there are changes in number\nof different biological pathways.\nOne of those pathways\nis the pathways related\nto collagen synthesis.\nSo not only are our ears growing,\nbut our noses are growing too,\nand my nose seems to be growing a lot.\nBut then again, I did\nsports where I would get\nmy nose broken, something\nI don't recommend.\nAs I always point out, you don't get\na nose like mine doing\nyoga, but nonetheless,\nmy nose is still growing and\nmy ears are still growing.\nAnd I suspect as I get older,\nif I have the good fortune of\nliving into my 80s and 90s,\nmy ears are going to continue to grow.\nA comparison between chronological\nage and biological age\nis something that's a really\ndeep interest these days\nin the work of David Sinclair\nat Harvard Medical School and others.\nSo called Horvath clocks\nthat people have developed\nhave tapped into how the\nepigenome and the genome\ncan give us some insight\ninto our biological age\nand how that compares to\nour chronological age.\nMost of us know our chronological age,\nbecause we know when we were born\nand we know where we are\nrelative to that now.\nBut you can start to make a little chart,\nif you like, about your\nrates of ear growth.\nYour rates of ear growth\nactually correlate pretty well\nwith your rates of biological progression\nthrough this thing that we call life.\nSo it's not something that\nwe think about too often,\nbut just like our DNA and our epigenome,\nand some other markers of metabolic health\nand hormone health relate to our age,\nso does our collagen synthesis.\nAnd one of the places\nthat shows up the most\nis in these two little goodies\non the sides of our heads,\nwhich are our ears.\nSo even though it's a little\nbit of a bizarre metric,\nit makes perfect sense in\nthe biological context.\nSo let's talk about balance\nand how to get better at balancing.\nThe reason why we're talking about balance\nand how to get better at balancing\nin the episode about hearing\nis that all the goodies\nthat are going to allow you\nto do that are in your ears.\nThey're also in your brain, but\nthey're mostly in your ears.\nSo as you recall from the\nbeginning of this episode,\nyou have two cochlea, cochleas,\nthat are one on each side of your head.\nAnd that's a little\nspiral snail-shaped thing\nthat converts sound waves\ninto electrical signals\nthat the rest of your\nbrain can understand.\nRight next to those,\nyou have what are called\nsemicircular canals.\nThe semicircular canals\ncan be best visualized\nas thinking about three hula\nhoops with marbles in them.\nSo imagine that you have a hula hoop\nand it's not filled with\nmarbles all the way around,\nit's just got some marbles\ndown there at the base.\nSo if you were to move\nthat hula hoop around,\nthe marbles would move around, [shushing].\nYou've got three of those and\neach one of those hula hoops\nhas these marbles that can move around.\nOne of those hula hoops\nis positioned vertically\nwith respect to gravity.\nSo it's basically parallel to your nose.\nIt sits like this, if\nyou're watching on a video,\nbut basically it's upright.\nAnother one of those\nhula hoops is basically\nat a 90-degree angle to your nose.\nIt's basically parallel to the floor\nif you're standing up right\nnow, if you're seated.\nAnd the other one, it's kind of tilted\nabout 45 degrees in between those.\nNow why is the system there?\nWell, those marbles within\neach one of those hula hoops\ncan move around, but\nthey'll only move around\nif your head moves in a particular way,\nand there are three planes or three ways\nthat your head can move.\nYour head can move up and down\nlike I'm nodding right now.\nSo that's called pitch,\nit's pitching forward or pitching back.\nSo it's a nod, up and down,\nor I can shake my head no, side to side.\nThat's called a yaw.\nYou pilots will be very\nfamiliar with this, yaw.\nNot yawn, yaw.\nAnd then there's roll, tilting\nthe head from side to side,\nthe way that a cute\npuppy might look at you\nfrom side to side or that if somebody\ndoesn't really understand or\nbelieve what you're saying,\nthey might tilt their head,\nvery common phenomenon.\nI mean, nobody does that to me,\nbut they do that to each other.\nSo pitch, yaw and roll are\nthe movements of the head\nin each of the three major\nplanes of motion, as we say.\nAnd each one of those causes those marbles\nto move in one or two of\nthe various hula hoops.\nSo if I move my head\nup and down when I nod,\none of those hula hoops,\nliterally, right now,\nthe marbles are moving back and forth.\nThey aren't actually marbles by the way,\nthese are little, kind of\nlike little stones, basically,\nlittle calcium-like deposits\nand when they roll back and forth,\nthey deflect little hairs,\nlittle hair cells that\naren't like the hair cells\nthat we use for measuring sound waves.\nThey're not too different, but\nthey are different from them,\nnot like the hairs on our heads,\nbut they're basically rolling past\nthese little hair cells\nand causing them to deflect\nand when they deflect\ndownward, the neurons,\nbecause hair cells are neurons,\nsend information up to the brain.\nSo if I move my head like this,\nthere's a physical movement\nof these little stones\nin this hula hoop as I'm referring to it,\nbut they deflect these\nhairs, send those hairs,\nwhich are neurons, those hair cells,\nsend information off to the brain.\nIf I move my head from side to side,\ndifferent little stones move.\nIf I roll my head, different stones move.\nThis is an exquisite system\nthat exists in all animals\nthat have a jaw.\nSo any fish that has\na jaw has this system,\na puppy has the system,\nany animal that has a jaw has\nthis so-called balance system,\nwhich we call the vestibular system.\nOne of the more important things to know\nabout the vestibular, the balance system\nis that it works together\nwith the visual system.\nLet's say I hear something off to my left\nand I swing my head over to\nthe left to see what it is.\nThere are two sources of\ninformation about where my head is\nrelative to my body and\nI need to know that.\nFirst of all, when I quickly\nmove my head to the side,\nthose little stones, as\nI'm referring to them,\nI realize they're not actually stones,\nbut as I'm referring to them,\nthey quickly, whoom,\nactivate those hair cells\nin that one semicircular canal,\nand send a signal off to my brain\nthat my head just moved\nto the side like this,\nnot that it went like\nthis and pitched back\nor not that it tilted, but\nit just moved to the side.\nBut also visual information\nslid past my field of view.\nI didn't have to think about it,\nbut just slid past my field of view.\nAnd when those two signals combine,\nmy eyes then lock to\na particular location.\nNow, if this is at all complicated,\nyou can actually uncouple these things.\nIt's very easy to do. You\ncan do this right now.\nIn fact, I'd like you\nto do this experiment\nif you're not already doing something else\nthat requires your attention.\nAnd certainly, don't do\nthis if you're driving.\nYou're going to sit down and\nyou're going to move your head\nto the left very slowly\nwith your eyes open.\nSo you're going to move\nit very, very slowly.\nThe whole thing should\ntake about five, six,\nmaybe even 10 seconds to complete.\nOkay, I just did it.\nNow, I'm going to do it very quickly.\nI'd like you to do it\nvery quickly as well.\nNow do it slowly again.\nWhat you probably noticed\nis that it's very\nuncomfortable to do it slowly,\nbut you can do it very quickly\nwithout much discomfort at all.\nYou just move your head to the side.\nThe reason is when you move\nyour head, very slowly,\nthose little stones at the\nbase of that hula hoop,\nthey don't get enough momentum to move.\nSo you're actually not\ngenerating this signal\nto the brain that your head is moving.\nAnd what you'll notice is\nthat your eyes have to go,\nboom, boom, boom, jumping\nover step-by-step.\nWhereas if you move your\nhead really quickly,\nthe signal gets off to\nyour brain and your eyes\njust go boom, right to the\nlocation you want to look at.\nSo moving your body slowly\nis actually very disruptive\nto the vestibular system.\nAnd it's very disruptive\nto your visual system.\nNow, if you've ever had the misfortune\nof being on a boat and you're\ngoing through big oscillations\non the boat, for those of you seasick,\nfolks that get seasick,\nthis can actually make\ncertain people seasick\njust to hear about it,\nthose big oscillations\ngoing up and down and up and down.\nThose are very disruptive.\nWe'll talk about nausea in a minute\nand how to offset that kind of nausea.\nI get pretty seasick, but there are ways\nthat you can deal with\nthis but this is incredible\nbecause what it means is\na purely physical system\nof these little stones\nrolling around in there\nand directing where your eyes should go.\nSo you can do this also\njust by looking up.\nSo let's just say, you're\nsitting in a chair,\nyou're going to look\nup towards the ceiling\nand your eyes will just go there.\nYou're doing this eyes\nopen and you look down.\nNow try doing it right\nreally, really slowly.\nSome people even get\nmotion sick doing this,\nwhich if you do, then just stop.\nOkay, so you can do this also to the side,\nalthough it works best if\nyou're moving your head\nfrom side to side and\nwe're nodding up and down.\nSo what we're doing\nhere is we're uncoupling\nthese two mechanisms,\nwe're pulling them apart,\nthe visual part and the vestibular part,\njust to illustrate to you that, normally,\nthese mechanisms in your\ninner ear tell your eyes\nwhere to go, but as well,\nyour eyes tell your balance\nsystem, your vestibular system,\nhow to function.\nSo I'd like you to do\na different experiment.\nI'm not going to do it right\nnow, but basically stand up.\nIf you get the opportunity,\nyou can do this safely,\nwherever you are, you're going to stand up\nand you're going to look\nforward about 10, 12 feet.\nPick a point on a wall or you can,\nanywhere that you like,\nif you're out in public,\njust do it anyway.\nJust tell them you're listening\nto Huberman Lab Podcasts,\nand someone's telling you to do it.\nAnyway, if you don't want\nto do it, don't do it.\nBut, basically, do it.\nStand on one leg and\nlift up the other leg.\nYou can bend your knee, if you like\nand just look off into the\ndistance about 10, 12 feet.\nIf you can do that, if\nyou can stand on one leg,\nnow close your eyes,\nchances are you're going\nto suddenly feel what\nscientists call postural sway.\nYou're going to start\nswaying around a lot.\nIt is very hard to balance\nwith your eyes closed.\nAnd if you think about that,\nit's like, why is that?\nThat's crazy.\nWhy would it be that it's hard to balance\nwith your eyes closed?\nWell, information about the\nvisual world also feeds back\nonto this vestibular system.\nSo the vestibular system\ninforms your vision\nand tells you where to move your eyes\nand your eyes and their positioning tell\nyour balance system,\nyour vestibular system\nhow it should function.\nSo there's a really cool way\nthat you can learn to optimize balance.\nYou're not going to try\nand do this by learning\nto balance with your eyes closed.\nWhat you can do is you can raise one leg\nand you can look at a short distance,\nmaybe off to just the distance\nthat your thumb would be\nif you were to reach your\narm out in front of you.\nAlthough you don't necessarily have to put\nyour thumb in front of you.\nSo maybe just about two\nfeet in front of you.\nThen while still balancing,\nyou're going to step your\nvision out a further distance,\nand then a further distance\nand as far as you can possibly see\nin the environment that you're in.\nAnd then you're going\nto march it back to you.\nNow, what the literature shows\nis that this kind of balance training\nwhere you incorporate the\nvisual system and extending out,\nand then marching back in the point\nat which you direct your visual focus,\nsends robust information\nabout the relationship\nbetween your visual world\nand your balance system.\nAnd, of course, the\nbalance system includes\nnot just these hula hoops,\nthese semicircular canals,\nbut they communicate with the cerebellum,\nthe so-called mini-brain,\nit actually means mini-brain\nin the back of your brain,\ncombines that with visual information\nand your map of the body surface.\nThat pattern of training\nis very beneficial\nfor enhancing your ability to balance\nbecause the ability to balance\nis, in part, the activation of\nparticular postural muscles,\nbut just as much, perhaps even moreso,\nit's about being able to\nadjust those postural muscles,\nexcuse me, it's about the ability\nto adjust those postural muscles\nas you experience changes\nin your visual world.\nAnd one of the most robust ways\nthat you can engage changes\nin your visual world\nis through your own movement.\nAnd so most people are not trying\nto balance in place, right?\nThey're not just trying to stand there\nlike a statue on one leg.\nMost of what we think about\nwhen we think about balance\nis for sake of sport or dynamic balance\nof being able to break ourselves,\nwhen we're lunging in\none particular direction\nto stop ourselves, that is,\nand then to move in another direction\nor for skateboarding or surfing or cycling\nor any number of different\nthings, gymnastics.\nSo the visual system is the primary input\nby which you develop balance,\nbut you can't do it just\nwith the visual system.\nSo what I'm recommending\nis if you're interested\nin cultivating a sense of balance,\nunderstand the relationship\nbetween the semicircular canals,\nunderstand that they are\nboth driving eye movements\nand they are driven by eye movements.\nIt's a reciprocal relationship.\nAnd then even just two\nor three minutes a day,\nor every once in a while,\neven three times a week,\nmaybe five minutes, maybe\n10 minutes, you pick,\nbut if you want to enhance balance,\nyou have to combine changes\nin your visual environment\nwith a static posture, standing on one leg\nand shifting your visual\nenvironment or static visual view,\nlooking at one thing and\nchanging your body posture.\nSo those two things,\nwe now know from the\nscientific literature,\ncombine in order to give an\nenhanced sense of balance.\nAnd there's a really nice paper\nthat was published in 2015\ncalled Effects of Balance\nTraining on Balance Performance.\nThis was in healthy adults.\nIt's a systematic review\nand a meta analysis.\nA meta analysis is when you combine\na lot of literature from\na lot of different papers\nand extract the really robust\nand the less robust statistical effects.\nSo it's a really nice paper as well.\nThere are some papers\nout there, for instance,\ncomparison of static balance\nand the role of vision\nin the elite athletes.\nThis is essentially the paper\nthat I've extracted\nmost of the information\nthat I just gave you from.\nAnd that paper, and there\nare some others as well,\nbut basically I distilled them down\ninto their core components.\nThe core components are\nmove your vision around\nwhile staying static, still\nbut in a balanced position\nlike standing on one leg,\ncould be something more complicated\nif you're somebody who can do\nmore complicated movements.\nUnilateral movement\nseemed to be important,\nso standing on one leg as opposed to both,\nor trying to generate\nsome tilt is another way\nto go about it or imbalance,\nmeaning one limb\nasymmetrically being activated\ncompared to the other limb.\nAnd then the other way to encourage\nor to cultivate and build\nup this vestibular system\nand your sense of balance\nactually involves movement itself,\nacceleration.\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to talk about now.\nSo up until now, I've\nbeen talking about balance\nonly in the static sense,\nlike standing on one leg for instance,\nbut that's a very artificial situation.\nEven though you can\ntrain balance that way,\nmost people who want to\nenhance their sense of balance\nfor sport or dance, or\nsome other endeavor,\nwant to engage balance in a dynamic way,\nmeaning moving through lots of\ndifferent planes of movement,\nmaybe even sometimes\nwhile squatting down low\nor jumping and landing\nor making trajectories\nthat are different angles.\nFor that, we need to consider\nthat the vestibular system\nalso cares about acceleration.\nSo it cares about head position,\nit cares about eye position\nand where the eyes are\nand where you're looking,\nbut it also cares\nabout what direction\nyou're moving and how fast.\nAnd one of the best things that you can do\nto enhance your sense of balance\nis to start to bring\ntogether your visual system,\nthe semicircular canals of the inner ear\nand what we call linear acceleration.\nSo if I move forward in\nspace rigidly upright,\nit's a vastly different situation\nthan if I'm leaning to the side.\nOne of the best ways to cultivate\na better sense of balance, literally,\nwithin the sense organs and the neurons\nand the biology of the\nbrain is to get into modes\nwhere we are accelerating\nforward, typically,\nit's forward while also tilted\nwith respect to gravity.\nNow this would be the\ncarve on a skateboard\nor on a surf board or a snowboard.\nThis would be the taking\na corner on a bike\nwhile being able to\nlean, safely, of course,\nlean into the turn so that your head\nis actually tilted with\nrespect to the earth.\nSo anytime that we are rigidly upright,\nwe aren't really exercising the\nvestibular system imbalance.\nAnd this is why you see people in the gym\non these, one of those bouncy balls,\nBocce balls are the one that\nthe guys roll in the park.\nBouncy balls, where they're\nbalancing back and forth,\nthat will work the small\nstabilizing muscles.\nBut what I'm talking about\nis getting into modes\nwhere you actually tilt\nthe body and the head\nwith respect to earth.\nWhat I mean is with respect\nto Earth's gravitational pull.\nNow the cerebellum is a\nvery interesting structure\nbecause not only is it\ninvolved in balance,\nbut it's also involved in skill-learning\nand in generating timing of movements.\nIt's a fascinating structure deserving\nof an entire episode or several\nepisodes all on its own,\nbut some of the outputs of the cerebellum,\nmeaning the neurons in\nthe cerebellum get inputs,\nbut they also send information out.\nThe outputs of the cerebellum\nare strongly linked\nto areas of the brain that\nrelease neuromodulators\nthat make us feel really\ngood, in particular,\nserotonin and dopamine.\nAnd this is an early emerging\nsub-field within neuroscience,\nbut a lot of what are\ncalled the non-motor outputs\nof the cerebellum have\na profound influence,\nnot just on our ability to\nlearn how to balance better,\nbut also how we feel overall.\nSo for you exercisers out there,\nI do hope people are getting\nregular healthy amounts of exercise.\nWe've talked about what that\nmeans in previous episodes,\nso at least 150 minutes\na week of endurance work,\nsome strength training,\na minimum five sets per body\npart to maintain musculature\neven if you don't want to grow muscles,\nyou want to do that in\norder to maintain healthy,\nstrengthened bones, et cetera.\nIf you're doing that but\nyou're only doing things\nlike curls in the gym, squats in the gym,\nriding the Peloton, or even\nif you're outside running,\nand you're getting forward acceleration,\nbut you're never actually getting tilted,\nyou're never actually getting tilted\nwith respect to Earth's\ngravitational pull,\nyou're not really exercising\nand getting the most\nout of your nervous system.\nActivation of the cerebellum in this way\nof being tilted or the head being tilted\nand the body being tilted\nwhile in acceleration,\ntypically forward acceleration,\nbut sometimes side to side has a profound\nand positive effect on our\nsense of mood and wellbeing.\nAnd as I talked about in previous episode,\nit can also enhance our\nability to learn information\nin the period after\ngenerating those tilts.\nAnd the acceleration.\nAnd that's because the\ncerebellum has these outputs\nto these areas of the brain\nthat release these neuromodulators,\nlike serotonin and dopamine.\nAnd they make us feel really good.\nI think this is one of the\nreasons why, growing up,\nI had some friends, some\nof whom might've been\nthe world heavyweight\nchampions of laziness\nfor essentially everything,\nexcept they would wake up at\n4:30 in the morning to go surf.\nThey would drive, they would\nget up so early to go surf.\nIt's not just surfers and\nsome surfers, by the way,\nI should point out are not lazy humans.\nThey do a lot of other things.\nBut I knew people that couldn't\nbe motivated to do anything,\nbut they were highly driven\nto get into these experiences\nof forward acceleration while tilted\nwith respect to gravity,\nlikewise, with snowboarding\nor skiing or cycling.\nThose modes of exercise seem\nto have an outsized effect\nboth on our wellbeing and our ability\nto translate the vestibular\nbalance that we achieve\nin those endeavors to\nour ability to balance\nwhile doing other things,\nand I don't mean psychological\nbalance necessarily.\nI mean physical balance.\nSo for those of you that\ndon't think of yourselves\nas very coordinated or\nwith very good balance,\ngetting into these modes of\nacceleration forward movement\nor lateral movement while getting tilted,\neven if you have to do it\nslowly, could be beneficial,\nI do believe, and the\nscientific literature points\nto the fact that it will be beneficial\nfor cultivating better\nsense of physical balance.\nIt can really build up the circuits\nof this vestibular system.\nAnd then, of course,\nthe feel-good components\nof acceleration while tilted\nor while getting the head\ninto different orientations\nrelative to gravity,\nwell, that's the explanation\nfor roller-coasters.\nSome people hate roller-coasters.\nThey make them feel nauseous.\nMany people love roller-coasters\nand one of the reasons\nthey love roller-coasters\nis because of the way that\nwhen you get the body,\neven if you're not\ngenerating the movement,\nyou get the body into forward acceleration\nand you're going upside\ndown and tilted to the side\nas the tracks go from side\nto side and tilt, et cetera,\nyou're getting activation\nof these deeper brain nuclei\nthat trigger the release\nof neuromodulators\nthat just make us feel\nreally, really good.\nIn fact, some people get a long arc,\na long duration buzz from having gone\nthrough those experiences.\nSome people who hate roller-coasters\nare probably getting nauseous,\njust hearing about that.\nSo I encourage people to get\ninto modes of acceleration\nwhile tilted every once in a while,\nprovided you can do it safely.\nIt's an immensely powerful\nway to build up your skills\nin the realm of balance.\nAnd it's also, for most\npeople, very, very pleasing.\nIt feels really good because\nof the chemical relationship\nbetween forward acceleration\nand head tilt and body tilt.\nNow, speaking of feeling nauseous,\nsome people suffer from vertigo.\nSome people feel dizzy,\nsome people get lightheaded.\nAn important question\nto ask yourself, always,\nif you're feeling quote-unquote\ndizzy or lightheaded,\nis are you dizzy or are you lightheaded?\nNow, we're not going to\ndiagnose anything here\nbecause there's just\nno way we can do that.\nThis is essentially me\nshouting into a tunnel.\nSo we don't know what's going on\nwith each and every one of you\nbut if ever you feel that\nyour world is spinning,\nbut that you can focus on\nyour thumb, for instance,\nbut the rest of the world is spinning\nand your thumb is stationary,\nthat's called being dizzy.\nNow, if you feel like you're falling\nor that you feel like you need to get down\nonto the ground because\nyou feel light-headed,\nthat's being light-headed.\nAnd, oftentimes, with\nlanguage we don't distinguish\nbetween being dizzy and being lightheaded.\nNow there are a lot of ways that dizziness\nand lightheadedness can occur.\nAnd I don't even want to\nbegin to guess at the number\nof different things and\nways that it could happen\nfor those of you that suffer from it\nbecause it could be any number of them.\nBut, oftentimes, if people\nare lightheaded, yes,\nit could be low blood sugar.\nIt could also be that you're dehydrated.\nIt could also be that you\nare low in electrolytes.\nWe talked about this\nin a previous episode,\nbut we will talk about it\nmore in a future episode.\nMany people have too little\nsodium in their system, salt,\nand that's why they feel lightheaded.\nI have family members who, for years,\nthought they had disrupted blood sugar.\nThey would get shaky,\njittery, lightheaded,\nfeel like they were nauseous, et cetera.\nAnd simply the addition of little sea salt\nto their water remedied\nthe problem entirely.\nI don't think it's going\nto remedy every issue\nof lightheadedness out\nthere by any stretch,\nbut just the addition of\nsalt, in this particular case,\nhelped the person.\nAnd they are not alone.\nMany people who think that\nthey have low blood sugar,\nactually are lightheaded\nbecause of low electrolytes\nand because of the way\nthat salt carries water\ninto the system and creates\nchanges in blood volume,\net cetera.\nLow sodium can often be a\nsource of lightheadedness\nas can low blood sugar and, of course,\nother things as well.\nNow for dizziness or seasickness,\nwe were all taught that\nyou need to pick a point\non the horizon and focus on it.\nBut actually, that's not correct.\nIt is true that if you are\ndown in the cabin of a boat\nor you're on the lower\ndeck and all you can see\nare things up close to you,\nthat getting sloshed around, like so\nor the boat going up and down, like so,\nI think I'm getting a little\nseasick, even as I do this\nand I describe it,\nfocusing on things close\nto you can be problematic.\nAnd in that case, the\nadvice to go up on deck\nand get fresh air and to\nlook off into the horizon,\nthat part is correct.\nBut focusing your eyes\non a particular location\non the horizon is effectively like trying\nto move very slowly as\nI had you do before,\nwhere you're trying to\nmove your head very slowly\nwhile fixating on one location.\nYour eyes and your balance\nsystem were designed\nto move together.\nSo really, what you want to\ndo is allow your visual system\nto track with your vestibular system.\nThis is why sitting in the\nback of an Uber or a taxi\nand being on your phone\ncan make you suddenly feel very nauseous.\nSometimes the cabs,\nparticularly in New York City,\nthey have a lot of occluders,\nthey have a lot of stuff\nblocking your field of view.\nThere's usually a little\nportal where you can see out\nto the front of the front windshield,\nbut there's all this stuff now,\ntelevisions in the back\nseat and you're watching\nthat television and the cab is moving.\nYou're in linear acceleration,\nand sometimes you're taking\ncorners, you're braking\nso then your vestibular\nsystem has to adjust to that.\nIf you're looking at your phone or a book,\nor even if you're talking\nto somebody, actually,\nI'm starting to feel a little nauseous\njust talking about it.\nI promise I'm not going\nto finish this episode\nby vomiting at the end, at least not here,\nbut what can happen is\nthat you're uncoupling\nthe visual information from your motion,\nfrom your vestibular information.\nYou want those to be coupled.\nThis is why a lot of people have to drive,\nthey can't be in the passenger seat.\nBecause when you drive,\nyou also get what's called\nproprioceptive feedback.\nYour body is sending signals\nalso to the vestibular system\nabout where you are in space.\nWhen you're the passenger,\nyou're just getting jolted\naround as the person is driving.\nAnd if you're looking at\nyour phone, it's even worse.\nAnd if you're looking at the occluder\nbetween you and the two front\nseats, that's even worse.\nSo this is why staring out\nthe front windshield is great\nbut you don't want to fixate.\nSo, hopefully, I spared a\nfew people and, hopefully,\na few cab drivers of\nhaving people get sick\nin their cars or Ubers.\nLet your visual system\nand your vestibular system work together.\nIf appropriate, get into\nlinear acceleration,\nand you'll improve your sense of balance.\nOnce again, we've covered\na tremendous amount of information.\nNow, you know how you hear,\nhow you make sense of the\nsounds in your environment,\nhow those come into your ears\nand how your brain processes them.\nIn addition, we talked about things\nlike low level white noise\nand even binaural beats,\nwhich can be used to enhance\ncertain brain states,\ncertain rhythms within the brain,\nand even dopamine release in ways\nthat allow you to learn better.\nAnd we talked about the balance system\nand this incredible relationship\nbetween your vestibular apparatus,\nmeaning the portions of your inner ear\nthat are responsible for balance\nand your visual system and gravity.\nAnd you can use those to\nenhance your learning as well,\nas well as just to enhance\nyour sense of balance.\nIf you're learning from this podcast,\nplease subscribe on YouTube,\nthat really helps us.\nIn
