    "transcript": "[gentle upbeat music]\n- [Andrew] Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, I have the pleasure of\nintroducing the first guest\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nMy guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth.\nDr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical doctor,\nhe's a psychiatrist and\na research scientist\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nIn his clinical practice, he sees patients\ndealing with a range of\nnervous system disorders,\nincluding obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, autism,\nattention deficit disorders,\nschizophrenia, mania,\nanxiety disorders, and eating disorders.\nHis laboratory develops and explores tools\nwith which to understand\nhow the nervous system works\nin the healthy situation,\nas well as in disorders of the mind.\nDr. Deisseroth's laboratory\nhas pioneered the development\nand use of what are called channelopsins,\nproteins that come from algae,\nwhich can now be introduced\nto the nervous systems\nof animals and humans, in\norder to precisely control\nthe activity of neurons\nin the brain and body\nwith the use of light.\nThis is a absolutely\ntransformative technology,\nbecause whereas certain drug treatments\ncan often relieve certain\nsymptoms of disorders,\nthey often carry various side effects.\nAnd in some individuals,\noften many individuals,\nthese drug treatments simply do not work.\nThe channelopsins and their\nrelated technologies stand\nto transform the way that we\ntreat psychiatric illness,\nand various disorders of\nmovement and perception.\nIn fact, just recently,\nthe channelopsins were\napplied in a human patient,\nto allow an adult fully blind\nhuman being to see light,\nfor the very first time.\nWe also discuss Dr. Deisseroth's\nnewly released book,\nwhich is entitled \"Projections:\nA Story of Human Emotions\".\nThis is an absolutely remarkable book,\nthat uses stories about his\ninteractions with his patients,\nto teach you how the brain works\nin the healthy and diseased state,\nand also reveals the\nmotivation for and discovery\nof these channelopsins\nand other technologies\nby Karl's laboratory,\nthat are being used now\nto treat various disorders\nof the nervous system,\nand that in the future,\nare certain to transform\nthe fields of psychiatry,\nmental health, and health in general.\nI found our conversation to be\nan absolutely fascinating one\nabout how the brain functions\nin the healthy state,\nand why and how it breaks\ndown in disorders of the mind.\nWe also discuss the\ncurrent status and future\nof psychedelic treatments\nfor psychiatric illness,\nas well as we're understanding\nhow the brain works more generally.\nWe also discuss issues of consciousness,\nand we even delve into\nhow somebody like Karl\nwho's managing a full-time\nclinical practice\nand a 40 plus person laboratory,\nand a family of five children\nand is happily married,\nhow he organizes his internal landscape,\nhis own thinking in order to\nmanage that immense workload\nand to progress forward\nfor the sake of medicine\nand his pursuits in science.\nI found this to be an\nincredible conversation,\nI learned so much.\nI also learned, through the course\nof reading Karl's book, \"Projections\",\nthat not only is he an\naccomplished psychiatrist,\nand obviously an accomplished\nresearch scientist\nand a family man, but he's\nalso a phenomenal writer.\n\"Projections\" is absolutely\nmasterfully written.\nIt's just beautiful, and\nit's accessible to anybody,\neven if you don't have\na science background.\nSo, I hope that you'll\nenjoy my conversation\nwith Karl Deisseroth as much as I did,\nand thank you for tuning in.\nBefore we begin, I want to point out\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIn my desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto consumer information about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public,\nI'd like to acknowledge the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat in my opinion, are the\nvery highest quality out there.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford, and everything\nabout the eyeglasses\nand sunglasses was developed\nwith performance in mind.\nOne of the things I really\nlove about Roka sunglasses,\nis that unlike other sunglasses\nthat make it hard to see\nwhen there's a lot of cloud cover,\nor when the shadows change\nor environmental conditions change,\nwith Roka sunglasses,\nthey clearly understand\nthe signs of the visual system,\nbecause when I put them\non for the first time,\nI noticed that as I moved into shadows\nor the cloud cover changed\nor the day got brighter\nor dimmer, everything\nwas still crystal clear.\nAnd that's also because the lenses\nare tremendously high optical clarity,\nand the glasses are really lightweight.\nYou don't even notice that they're on.\nThe other thing is that the eyeglasses,\nI wear readers at night,\nthey're incredibly lightweight,\nand for both the\nsunglasses and eyeglasses,\nthe aesthetic is terrific.\nUnlike a lot of performance eyewear,\nwhich frankly can look kind of cyborg-like\nand kind of ridiculous, the\naesthetic of the glasses\nis such that you could\nreally wear them anywhere,\nindoors or outdoors.\nIf you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses,\nyou can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,\nand enter the code \"Huberman\",\nto save 20% on your first order.\nThat's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,\nand enter the code\n\"Huberman\", at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from\nyour blood and DNA,\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done.\nAnd now with the advent\nof good genetic DNA tests,\nI'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.\nThe simple reason for this\nis that many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate\nand longterm health,\ncan only be measured and evaluated\nwith a quality blood test.\nAnd now, the DNA tests\nfurther inform our immediate\nand long-term health.\nOne of the problems with a lot\nof DNA tests and blood tests\nout there however, is that\nyou get the information back,\nand you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, you\nget the numbers back\nof different metabolic\nfactors, hormones, et cetera,\nbut it also provides simple directives,\nas to how perhaps you might want to change\nyour nutritional intake\nor your exercise regimen,\nor other lifestyle factors,\nto bring those numbers\ninto alignment with where\nyou'd like them to be.\nInsideTracker also makes this really easy.\nThey have a dashboard that\nmakes organizing that all\nvery simple, and they can\neven have someone come\nto your house to take\nthe blood and DNA test.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code \"Huberman\", at checkout.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012,\nand I've taken it ever since,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand that I continue to\ntake Athletic Greens,\nis that it covers all my\nvitamin and mineral bases,\nand it covers my probiotic needs.\nThere's now a wealth of data showing\nthat probiotics support\na healthy gut microbiome,\nand that a healthy gut microbiome supports\nthe gut brain access for healthy mood.\nIt also supports\nmetabolism, immune function,\nendocrine, that means hormone function,\nand a host of other important\nbiological functions.\nI drink it once or twice a day.\nI mix it with water and a\nlittle bit of lemon juice\nor some lime juice, and\nit's absolutely delicious.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer,\nwhere they will give you a\nyear's supply of vitamin D3.\nIn addition, they'll give\nyou five free travel packs.\nVitamin D3 as we all\nknow, is very important\nfor a huge range of biological\nfunctions and health.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nfor your Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs,\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3.\nAnd now, my conversation\nwith Dr. Karl Deisseroth.\nWell, thanks for being here.\n- Thanks for having me.\n- It's been a long time coming for me,\nbecause you may not know this,\nbut one of the reasons\nI started this podcast\nwas actually so I could\nhave this conversation.\n[Karl laughs]\nIt's but one, there are other reasons,\nbut one of the goals is to\nbe able to hold conversations\nwith colleagues of mine that\nare doing incredible work\nin the realm of science,\nand then here we also have\nthis really special opportunity\nbecause you're also a clinician.\nYou see patients and have for a long time.\nSo for people that\nmight not be so familiar\nwith the fields of\nneuroscience, et cetera,\nwhat is the difference between\nneurology and psychiatry?\n- Well, I'm married to a\nneurologist and I am a psychiatrist\nand we make fun of each\nother all the time.\nA lot of neuroscientists and\na lot of brain clinicians\nactually think these two\nshould be in the same field\nat some point in the future,\nthey were in the past,\nthey started together.\nPsychiatry though, focuses on disorders\nwhere we can't see something\nthat's physically wrong,\nwhere we don't have a measurable,\nwhere there's no blood test\nthat makes the diagnosis,\nthere's no brain scan that\ntells us this is schizophrenia,\nand this is depression\nfor an individual patient.\nAnd so psychiatry is much more mysterious,\nand the only tools we have are words.\nNeurologists are fantastic physicians.\nThey see the stroke on brain scans,\nthey see the seizure and\nthe pre-seizure activity\nwith an EEG, and they can measure\nand treat based on those measureables.\nIn psychiatry, we have\na harder job, I think.\nWe use words, we have\nrating scales for symptoms,\nwe can measure depression and\nautism with rating scales,\nbut those are words still.\nAnd ultimately, that's what\npsychiatry is built around.\nIt's an odd situation because\nwe've got the most complex,\nbeautiful, mysterious,\nincredibly engineered\nobject in the universe,\nand yet all we have are\nwords to find our way in.\n- So, do you find that if\na patient is very verbal or\nhyper-verbal, that you have an\neasier time diagnosing them,\nas opposed to somebody who's\nmore quiet and reserved?\nOr it's, I could imagine the\nopposite might be true as well.\n- Well, because we only have words,\nyou've put your finger on a key point.\nIf they don't speak that much,\nin principle, it's harder.\nThe lack of speech can be a symptom.\nWe can see that in depression,\nwe can see that in the negative\nsymptoms of schizophrenia,\nwe can see that in autism.\nSometimes by itself, that is\na symptom, reduced speech,\nbut ultimately you do need something.\nYou need some words to help guide you\nand in fact, there's challenges\nthat I can tell you about\nwhere patients with depression\nwere so depressed, they can't speak.\nThat makes it a bit of a challenge\nto distinguish depression\nfrom some of the other reasons\nthey might not be speaking.\nAnd this is sort of the art\nand the science of psychiatry.\n- Do you find that there are patients\nthat have, well, let's call\nthem comorbidities or conditions\nwhere they would land in both\npsychiatry and neurology,\nmeaning there's damage to a\nparticular area of the brain\nand therefore they're depressed?\nAnd how do you tease that\nout as a psychiatrist?\n- Yeah, this happens all the time.\nParkinson's disease is a great example.\nIt can be debilitating in so many ways.\nPeople have trouble moving,\nthey have trouble walking,\nthey have trouble swallowing,\nand they can have a\ntruly severe depression.\nAnd this is where you\nmight say, \"Oh, well,\nthey've got a life-threatening illness\",\nbut there are plenty of\nneurological disorders\nwhere depression is not a\nstrongly comorbid symptom,\nlike ALS, Lou Gehrig's\ndisease, for example,\ndepression is not strongly\ncomorbid in that disease,\nbut in Parkinson's, it\nis extremely common.\nAnd as you know, in Parkinson's disease,\nwe have loss of the dopamine\nneurons in the midbrain.\nAnd this is a very specific\npopulation of cells\nthat's dying, and probably that leads\nto both the movement\ndisorder and the depression.\nThere are many examples of that\nwhere these two fields come together\nand you really need to work as a team.\nI've had patients in my clinic,\nthat I treat the depression\nassociated with their Parkinson's,\nand a neurologist treats the movement\nassociated with the Parkinson's\nand we work together.\n- Do you think we will\never have a blood test\nfor depression or schizophrenia or autism?\nAnd would that be a good or a bad thing?\n- I think ultimately there\nwill be quantitative tests.\nAlready, efforts are being made\nto look at certain rhythms in\nthe brain using external EEGs\nto look at brain waves effectively,\nlook at the ratios of certain frequencies\nto other frequencies,\nand there's some progress\nbeing made on that front.\nIt's not as good as it could be.\nIt doesn't really give you the confidence\nfor the individual patient\nthat you would like,\nbut ultimately, what's\ngoing on in the brain\nin psychiatric disease is physical,\nand it's due to the\ncircuits and the connections\nand the projections in the\nbrain that are not working\nas they would in a typical situation.\nAnd I do think we'll have those\nmeasureables at some point.\nNow, is that good or bad?\nI think that will be good,\nand one of the challenges\nwe have with psychiatry\nis it is an art as well as a science\nto elicit these symptoms in a precise way.\nIt does take some time,\nand it would be great\nif we could just do quick measurements.\nCould it be abused or misused?\nCertainly.\nBut that's I think true,\nfor all of medicine.\n- I want to know, and I'm\nsure there are several,\nbut what do you see as\nthe biggest challenge\nfacing psychiatry and the\ntreatment of mental illness today?\n- I think we're making progress\non what the biggest challenge is,\nwhich I think there's\nstill such a strong stigma\nfor psychiatric disease\nthat patients often don't come to us,\nand they feel that they\nshould be able to handle this\non their own.\nAnd that can slow treatment.\nIt can lead to worsening symptoms.\nWe know, for example,\npatients who have\nuntreated anxiety issues.\nIf you go for a year or more\nwith a serious untreated anxiety issue,\nthat can convert to depression.\nYou can add another problem\non top of the anxiety.\nAnd so it would be...\nWhy do people not come for treatment?\nThey feel like this is\nsomething they should be able\nto master on their own, which can be true,\nbut usually, some help is a good thing.\n- That raises a question\nrelated to something\nI heard you say many\nyears ago at a lecture,\nwhich was that, this\nwas a scientific lecture\nand you said, \"We don't\nknow how other people feel.\nMost of the time, we don't\neven really know how we feel.\"\n- [chuckles] Yeah.\n- [Andrew] Maybe you could\nelaborate on that a little bit\nand the dearth of ways that we\nhave to talk about feelings.\nI mean, there's so many words.\nI don't know how many,\nbut I'm guessing they're more\nthan a dozen words to describe\nthe state that I call sadness,\nbut as far as I understand,\nwe don't have any way of comparing that\nin a real objective sense.\nAs a psychiatrist, when\nyour job is to use words\nto diagnose, words of\nthe patient to diagnose,\ndo you maneuver around that?\nAnd what is this landscape\nthat we call feelings or emotions?\n- This is really interesting.\nHere there's a tension between\nthe words that we've built up\nin the clinic that mean\nsomething to the physicians,\nand then there's the\ncolloquial use of words\nthat may not be the same,\nand so that's the first\nlevel we have to sort out\nwhen someone says, \"I'm depressed\",\nwhat exactly do they mean by that?\nAnd that may be different\nfrom what we're talking about\nin terms of depression.\nSo part of psychiatry is\nto get beyond that word,\nand to get into how\nthey're actually feeling,\nget rid of the jargon and\nget to real world examples\nof how they're feeling.\nSo, how much do you look\nforward into the future?\nHow much hope do you have?\nHow much planning are\nyou doing for the future?\nSo here now you're\ngetting into actual things\nyou can talk about that are unambiguous.\nIf someone says, \"Yeah, I can't\neven think about tomorrow.\nI don't see how I'm going\nto get to tomorrow\".\nThat's a nice, precise\nthing that you know,\nit's sad, it's tragic, but\nalso, that means something.\nAnd we know what that means.\nThat's the hopelessness\nsymptom of depression.\nAnd that is what I try to do\nwhen I do a psychiatric interview.\nI try to get past the jargon,\nand get to what's actually\nhappening in a patient's life\nand in their mind.\nBut as you say, ultimately,\n[chuckles] and this shows up across...\nI address this issue every day in my life,\nwhether it's in the lab where\nwe're looking at animals,\nwhether fish or mice or rats\nand studying their behavior,\nor when I'm in a conversation\nwith just a friend\nor a colleague, or when\nI'm talking to a patient,\nI never really know what's going on\ninside the mind of the other person.\nI get some feedback, I get words,\nI get behaviors, I get actions,\nbut I never really know.\nAnd as you said at the very\nbeginning of the question,\noften we don't even have\nthe words and the insight\nto even understand what's\ngoing on in our own mind.\nI think a lot of psychiatrists\nare pretty introspective.\nThat's part of the reason\nthey end up in that specialty,\nand so, maybe we spend a little more time\nthan the average person\nthinking about what's going on within,\nbut it doesn't mean we have the answers.\n- So in this area of trying to figure out\nwhat's going on under\nthe hood through words,\nit sounds like certain words would relate\nto this idea of anticipation and hope.\nIs it fair to say that\nthat somehow relates\nto the dopamine system in the sense\nthat dopamine is involved\nin motivated behaviors?\nI mean, if I say for instance,\nand I won't ask you to\nrun a session with me here\n[chuckles] for free.\n[Karl laughs]\n- We'll do that off camera.\n- [Andrew] Off camera. Right.\nIf I were to say, \"I just\ncan't imagine tomorrow.\nI just can't do it.\"\nSo that's not an action-based,\nthat's purely based on\nmy internal narrative,\nbut I could imagine things like, you know,\nI have a terrible time\nsleeping, I'm not hungry,\nI'm not eating, so statements\nabout physical actions,\nI'm guessing also have validity.\n- Absolutely.\n- And there are now ways to measure\nthe accuracy of those statements.\nLike for instance, if\nI gave you permission,\nyou could know if I slept last night,\nor whether or not I was just saying\nI had a poor night's sleep.\n- Yes. That's right.\n- So in moving forward through 2021\nand into the next 10 and\n100 years of psychiatry,\ndo you think that the body\nreporting some of the actions\nof a human are going to become useful\nand mesh with the words in a way\nthat's going to make your job easier?\n- I do think that's true.\nAnd the two things you've\nmentioned, eating and sleeping,\nthose are additional criteria\nthat we use to diagnose depression.\nThese are the vegetative signs,\nwe call them of depression,\npoor sleep, and poor eating.\nAnd if you have a baseline for somebody,\nthat's the real challenge there.\nWhat's different in that person?\nSome people with\ndepressed, they sleep more.\nSome people who are\ndepressed, they sleep less.\nSome people who are depressed,\nthey're more physically agitated,\nand they move around more.\nSome people who are depressed,\nthey move less even while they're awake.\nAnd so you need...\nHere's the challenge is\nthat you can't just look\nat how they are now.\nYou have to get a baseline,\nand then see how it's changed.\nAnd that can be a challenge\nthat raises ethical issues,\nand how do you collect\nthat baseline information\nfrom someone healthy?\nI don't think that's\nsomething we have solved.\nOf course, with phones and\naccelerometers and phones,\nyou could in principle,\ncollect a lot of baseline\ninformation from people,\nbut that would have to be treated\nvery carefully for privacy reasons.\n- And in terms of measuring\none's own behavior,\nI've heard of work that's going on.\nSam Golden up in the\nUniversity of Washington\nwho works on aggression in animal models\nwas telling me that there's\nsome efforts that he's making,\nand perhaps you're involved\nin this work as well,\nI don't know, of devices\nthat would allow people\nto detect, for instance,\nwhen they're veering\ntowards a depressive episode\nfor themselves, that they\nmay choose or not choose\nto report that to their clinician,\nmaybe they don't even have a clinician.\nMaybe this person that you\nreferred to at the beginning,\nthis person who doesn't feel comfortable\ncoming to talk to you,\nmaybe something is measuring\nchanges in the inflection\nof their voice, or the speed\nat which they get up from a chair.\nDo you think that those kind of metrics\nwill eventually inform\nsomebody, \"Hey, you know,\nyou're in trouble\"?\nThis is getting to back to the statement\nthat I heard you make and\nit rung in my mind now,\nI think for more than a decade,\nwhich is, \"Oftentimes, we\ndon't even know how we feel.\"\n- Yeah.\nYou know, that I do like,\nbecause that gives the\npatient the agency to detect\nwhat's going on, and even\nseparate from modern technology,\nthis has been part of\nthe art of psychiatry\nis to help patients realize\nthat sometimes other people observing them\ncan give them the earliest\nwarning signs of depression.\nWe see this very often in family.\nThey'll notice when\nthe patient is changing\nbefore the patient does.\nAnd then there are things\nthe patient may notice,\nbut not correctly ascribe\nto the onset of depression.\nAnd a classic example of that\nis what we call 'early morning awakening'.\nAnd this is something\nthat can happen very early\nas people start to slide into depression.\nThey start to wake up earlier and earlier,\njust inexplicably, they're awake at-\n- This is like 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM awakening?\n- It could start...\nYeah, it could start at\n5:00 AM, could go to four,\nand three-\n- And are unable\nto fall back asleep?\n- Unable to fall back asleep. Exactly.\nAnd they may not know\nwhat to do with that.\nIt could just be, [chuckles]\nfrom their perspective,\nit's just something that's happening.\nBut if you put enough of\nthat information together,\nthat could be a useful\nwarning sign for the patient\nand it could help them seek treatment.\nAnd I think that is something\nthat could be really valuable.\n- Interesting.\nSo, in this framework of\nneeding words to self-report\nor machines to detect how we feel\nand maybe inform a psychiatrist\nhow a patient feels,\ntouch on some of the technologies\nthat you've been involved in building,\nbut as a way to march into that,\nare there any very good treatments\nfor psychiatric disease?\nMeaning, are there currently\nany pills, potions,\nforms of communication that\nreliably work every time,\nor work in most patients?\nAnd could you give a couple\nexamples of great successes\nof psychiatry if they exist?\n- Yes.\nYeah, we are fortunate.\nAnd this [chuckles] coming\nback to my, you know,\nthe joking between my wife and myself\nin terms of neurology and psychiatry,\nwe actually in psychiatry,\ndespite the depths\nof the mystery we struggled with,\nmany of our treatments are actually...\nWe may be doing better\nthan some other specialties\nin terms of actually\ncausing therapeutic benefit\nfor patients.\nWe do help patients, the\npatients who suffer from...\nBy the way, both\nmedications and talk therapy\nhave been shown to be extremely\neffective in many cases,\nfor example, people with panic disorder,\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\njust working with words,\nhelping people identify the early signs\nof when they're starting to\nmove toward a panic attack,\nwhat are the cognitions\nthat are happening?\nYou can train people to derail that,\nand you can very potently\ntreat panic disorder that way.\n- How long does something\nlike that take on average?\n- For a motivated, insightful patient,\nyou can have a very\ncookbooky series of sessions,\nthat's six to 12 sessions, or even less\nfor someone who's very\ninsightful and motivated\nand it can have a very\npowerful effect that quickly.\nAnd that's just with words,\nthere are many psychiatric medications\nthat are very effective for the conditions\nthat they're treating.\nAnti-psychotic medications,\nthey have side effects,\nbut boy, do they work!\nThey really can clear up\nparticularly the positive symptoms\nof schizophrenia for example,\nthe auditory hallucinations,\nthe paranoia, people's lives\ncan be turned around by these-\n- We should clarify positive symptoms.\nYou mean not positive in\nthe qualitative sense,\nyou mean positive meaning\nthat the appearance\nof something abnormal.\n- Exactly. Yeah.\nThank you for that clarification.\nWhen we say positive symptoms,\nwe do mean the addition of something\nthat wasn't there before,\nlike a hallucination or a paranoia,\nand that stands in contrast\nto the negative symptoms\nwhere something is taken away,\nand these are patients who are withdrawn.\nThey have what we call thought blocking.\nThey can't even progress forward\nin a sequence of thoughts.\nBoth of those can be\npart of schizophrenia,\nthe hallucinations and the paranoia\nare more effectively treated right now,\nbut they are effectively treated.\nAnd then, this is a frustrating,\nand yet heartening aspect of psychiatry.\nThere are treatments like\nelectroconvulsive therapy,\nwhere it's extremely\neffective for depression.\nWe have patients who\nnothing else works for them,\nwhere they can't tolerate medications,\nand you can administer under a very safe,\ncontrolled condition,\nwhere the patient's body is not moving.\nThey're put into a very safe situation\nwhere the body doesn't move or cease,\nit's just an internal process\nthat's triggered in the brain.\nThis is an extraordinarily\neffective treatment\nfor treatment-resistant depression.\nAt the same time, I find it [chuckles]\nas heartening as it is to\nsee patients respond to this\nwho have severe depression,\nI'm also frustrated by it.\nWhy can't we do something\nmore precise than this,\nfor these very severe cases?\nAnd people have sought\nfor decades to understand,\nhow is it that a seizure is leading\nto the relief of depression?\nAnd we don't know the answer yet.\nWe would love to do that.\nPeople are working hard on that,\nbut that is a treatment\nthat does work too.\nIn all of these cases\nthough in psychiatry,\nthe frustrating thing\nis that we don't have\nthe level of understanding\nthat a cardiologist has\nin thinking about the heart.\nYou know, the heart is,\nwe now know it's a pump.\nIt's pumping blood. and so\nyou can look at everything\nabout how it's working or not working,\nin terms of that frame,\nit's clearly a pump.\nWe don't really have that level\nof, what is the circuit really\nthere for in psychiatry?\nAnd that's what is missing.\nThat's what we need to find,\nso we can design truly effective\nand specific treatments.\n- So, what are the pieces\nthat are going to be required\nto cure autism, cure\nParkinson's, cure schizophrenia?\nI would imagine there are several\nelements and 'beens here',\nunderstanding the natural biology,\nunderstanding what the\nactivity patterns are,\nhow to modify those, maybe\nyou could just tell us\nwhat you think, what is the\nBento Box of the perfect cure?\n- I think the first thing\nwe need is understanding.\nAlmost every psychiatric treatment\nhas been serendipitously identified,\njust noting by chance that\nsomething that was done\nfor some person also had a side effect-\n- Like lithium or something-\n- Like lithium, is a good example.\n- Is it true that it was\nthe urine of guinea pigs\n[Karl laughs]\ngiven lithium\nthat was given to manic patients\nthat made them not manic?\nIs that true?\n- I don't have firsthand\nknowledge of that,\nbut I would defer that,\nbut it's true for\nessentially every treatment,\nthat the antidepressants originally arose\nas anti-tuberculosis drugs, for example.\n- I did not know that.\n- Yeah, and so this is a\nclassic example for illnesses\nacross all of psychiatry,\nand of course there's\nthe seizures as well.\nThat was noticed that\npatients who had epilepsy,\nthey had a seizure there\nand also had depression,\nthat they became much,\nat least for awhile,\nthey were improved after that seizure.\n- That's amazing.\nI don't want to take you\noff course of the question\nanswering the question I asked,\nbut I've heard before that if\nautistic children get a fever,\nthat their symptoms improve, is that true?\n- I've done a fair bit\nof work with autism.\nIn my clinical practice,\nI work with adult autism\nand I have heard statements like that\nand descriptions like that from\npatients and their families.\nThat is very hard to study quantitatively\nbecause often with the\nchildren, you have this\nnot as quantitative as you'd like\ncollection of symptom\ninformation from home.\nBut I have heard that enough that I think\nthere may well be something to that.\nAnd anytime you have a\nfever, what's going on?\nWell, we know all the cells in the brain,\nand I know this as an electrophysiologist,\nif you just change the\ntemperature by a few degrees,\neverything changes about how neurons work\nand that's even just a single neuron.\nIt's even more likely to\nbe complex and different\nwith a circuit of neurons that\nare all affecting each other.\nJust elevate the temperature a little bit,\neverything's different.\nAnd so, it's plausible for sure,\nthat things like that\ncould happen and do happen.\nAnd yet, when you think about\nautism, to take your example,\nyes, we see changes,\nbut what is the elements of\nthe brain that's analogous\nto the pumping heart?\nWhen we think about the\nsymptoms of depression,\nwe think about motivation\nand dopamine neurons.\nWhen we think about autism,\nit's a little more challenging.\nThere's a deficit in social interaction\nand in communication.\nAnd so where is that?\n[chuckles] Where is that situated?\nWhat is the key principle\ngoverning the social interaction?\nThis is where we need the basic science\nto bring us a step forward,\nso we can say okay, this is\nthe process that's going on.\nThis is what's needed for\nthe incredibly complex task\nof social interaction,\nwhere you've got incredibly\nrich data streams of sound\nand meaning, eye contact, body movement,\nand that's just for one person.\nWhat if there's a group of people?\nThis is overwhelming\nfor people with autism.\nWhat's the unifying thing there?\nIt's a lot of information,\nand that maybe is unmatched\nin any realm of biology,\nthe amount of information coming in\nthrough a social interaction,\nparticularly with words and language.\nAnd so then, that turns our\nattention as neuroscientists,\nwe think, okay, let's think\nabout the parts of the brain\nthat are involved in dealing with merging\ncomplex data streams that\nare very high in bit rate\nthat need to be fused together\ninto a unitary concept.\nAnd that starts to guide us,\nand we know other animals\nare social in their own way,\nand we can study those animals.\nAnd so that's how I think about it.\nThere's hope for the future,\nthinking about the symptoms\nas an engineer might,\nand trying to identify the\ncircuits that are likely working\nto make this typical behavior happen,\nand that will help us understand\nhow it becomes atypical.\n- So that seems like the first to me,\nthe first been of this,\nwhat I call the Bento Box\nfor lack of a better analogy,\nthat we need to know the circuits.\nWe need to know the cells\nin the various brain regions\nand end portions of the body\nand how they connect to one another,\nand what the patterns of activity are\nunder a normal 'healthy interaction'.\n- [Karl] Yeah.\n- If we understand that, then\nit seems that the next step,\nwhich of course could be\ncarried out in parallel, right?\nThough that work can\nbe done alongside work\nwhere various elements within\nthose circuits are tweaked\njust right, like the tuning\nof a piano in the subtle way,\nor maybe even like the\nreplacement of a whole set of keys\nif the piano is lacking keys, so to speak.\n- Right.\n- You've been very involved\nin trying to generate those tools.\nTell us about channelopsins,\nwhy you created them,\nand where they're at now\nin the laboratory and\nperhaps also in the clinic.\n- Well, first of all, I\ngive nature the credit\nfor creating channelrhodopsins.\nThese are beautiful little\nproteins that are made by algae,\nsingle-celled green algae.\nAnd there's a great story in basic science\nthat our understanding of animal behavior,\nsensation, cognition\nand action in our brains\nall the way back to a botanist\nin the 1850s and 1860s\nin Russia, is where the story begins.\nSo this was a botanist\nnamed Andrei Famintsyn\nwho worked at St. Petersburg,\nand he had noticed in the\nriver near his laboratory,\nthat there were algae\nthat he could look at\nin a dish, in a saucer.\nHe could put them there and he had light\nshining from the side.\nThe green tinge in the saucer of water\nwould move to a particular\ndistance from the light\nthat he was shining from the side,\nwhich was an amazing thing.\nIf he made the light brighter,\nthe green tinge would\nback off a little bit\nto a more optimal location,\nso just the right light level.\nSo this was plant behavior.\nIt was light-driven plant behavior,\nand he delves into this a little bit.\nHe identified that with microscopy,\nhe could see that there were\nlittle single-cell algae\nwith flagella that were swimming\nto the right light level.\nSo behaving plants, and\nthis has been the secret\nthat's helped us unlock so many principles\nof animal behavior.\nSo turns out,\nthese algae achieve this amazing results\nwith a single gene that\nencodes a single protein.\nWhat's a protein?\nIt's just a little bio-molecule\nthat does a job in a cell.\nAnd these are proteins that\nsit in the surface of cells\nin their surface membrane,\nand when a photon, a\nlight particle hits them,\nthey open a little pore, a\nlittle hole in the membrane\nand charged particles, ions like sodium\nrush across the pore.\nNow, why do they do that?\nThey do that to guide their\nflagella, that signal coming in,\nthose ions coming in through the pore\nin response to light,\nguide their flagella motor,\nthat guides them to a\nparticular spot in the saucer.\nNow, that's plant\nbehavior, but it turns out,\nas you know, this movement\nof ions across the membrane,\nthis happens to also be a neural code\nin our brains for on or off.\nSodium ions rushing into\nthe cells, turns them on.\nIt makes them fire away, fire\naction potentials communicate\nto the next cell down the chain,\nand this is an amazing opportunity\nbecause we can borrow these proteins.\nIn fact, we can take the gene\nthat directs the creation of the protein,\nand we can use genetic\ntricks, modern genetic tricks\nto put that gene into neurons\nin the brains of mammals,\nand then use light to turn those cells,\nthe specific cells that\nwe put this gene into,\nturn them on.\nThere are other opsins, we call them,\nthat you can use to turn cells off.\nIt's all fast, real time.\nYou can play in patterns\nof activity in real time\ninto cells or kinds of\ncells, just as a conductor\nelicits the music from the orchestra,\nthe strings and the woodwinds.\nAnd you can see what matters.\nWhat matters for sensation,\nwhat matters for cognition,\nwhat matters for action, and\nwe call this optogenetics.\n- Beautiful, and I must\nsay it was quite an honor\nand a privilege to watch optogenetics move\nfrom idea to discovery to the laboratory.\nI think we were postdocs at the same time,\n- We were, huh?\n- which is living proof that\npeople move at different rates,\nbecause [laughs] it's a joke\nat my expense by the way,\n[Karl laughing]\nbut it's really-\n- We end up in the same spot. [laughs]\n- That's right, [laughs]\nyeah, more or less.\nPhysically, if not professionally,\nbut nonetheless, it's been\na marvelous story thus far.\nAnd I'd like to...\nMaybe you could give us...\nI'd like to just touch\non a couple examples\nof where the technology\nresides in laboratories now,\nso maybe the range of animals\nthat it's being used in,\nand some of the phenomenon\nthat channelrhodopsins\nand their related genes\nand proteins are starting\nto elicit, what you've seen,\nand then I'd like to talk\nabout their applicability\nto the clinic, which is I\nthink the bigger mission,\nif you will.\n- Yeah.\nSo this whole thing, you know,\nit's been about, now going on 17 years\nthat we've been putting\nchannelrhodopsins into neurons.\nIt started just like Andre\nFamintsyn's work in a dish,\nthat was in 2004.\nIn 2007, we were putting\nthese into behaving mice,\nand we were able to with\na flick of a switch,\ncause them to move one\ndirection or another,\nby 2009-\n- So basically, you're\ncontrolling the mouse's behavior?\n- Yeah, exactly. In real time.\nSo we could make a mouse\nthat was just sitting there\ndoing nothing, to then turn\nleft very consistently,\nin fact, go around in a circle\nand as soon as we turn off\nthe light, it would stop.\nThat was an eye-opening moment.\nIt took really a few years\nto make optogenetics work.\nThere was a lot of putting all the...\nThere are a lot of problems\nthat had to be solved.\nThese channelrhodopsins\nactually don't move many ions.\nThey have a small current,\nsmall conductance, as we say.\nAnd so we had to figure out\nways to pack a lot of them\ninto cells without damaging cells,\nand still make them targetable,\nso we don't want them to\njust be in all the cells,\n'cause then it becomes\njust like an electrode.\nYou're just stimulating all\nthe cells that are nearby.\nWe had to keep that specificity,\nmake them targetable to just\none kind of cell or another,\nwhile still packing in\nlarge numbers of them\ninto those cells.\nAnd we had to get in the light\nin safe and specific ways,\nand so it took probably\nabout four or five years\nto really create optogenetics\nbetween 2004 and 2009.\nBy the end of that time though,\nwe had all the basic light\ndelivery, gene delivery,\nprinciples worked out, and\npeople started to apply\nthe technology to fish, to rats, to mice,\nto non-human primates like monkeys,\nand just a couple months ago,\nmy colleague, Botond Rosca in Switzerland,\nsucceeded in putting channelrhodopsins\ninto the eyes of human beings\nand making a blind person to see.\nAnd so that's pretty cool.\nThis was a patient with\nretinal degeneration,\nand he provided a channelrhodopsin\ninto the eye of this patient\nand was able to confer\nsome light sensitivity\nonto this patient that\nwasn't there before.\n- An amazing paper and discovery.\nI realize it was one patient,\nbut it's such an important milestone.\n- Well, as you say, it's\na very important milestone\nand the history of that is very deep.\nAlmost 10 years earlier,\nBotond Rosca and I\nhad published a paper in\nscience in human retina,\nbut X plants taken from cadavers\nfrom someone who had died,\nthe living retina taken out,\nopsins put into this retinal tissue\nand showing that it worked,\nrecording from the cells\nshowing that in these\nhuman retinal neurons,\nthat you could get light responses.\nBut then, from that moment,\nalmost 10 years of how\nclinical development goes,\nand this is a gene therapy\nand so you've got all the regulations\nand concerns and all that.\nIt took almost 10 years\nto get to this point now\nwhere a living human being\nhas a new functionality\nthat wasn't there before.\nNow, that's incredibly inspiring,\nand it's a beautiful thing.\nI would say though,\nthat the broader\nsignificance of optogenetics\nis really still understanding,\nbecause once you understand\nhow the circuitry works and\nwhich cells actually matter,\nthen any kind of treatment\nbecomes more grounded and logical\nand specific and principled.\nAnd whether it's a\nmedication, or a talk therapy\nor brain stimulation treatment\nwith electrical or magnetic means,\nif you actually know what matters,\n[chuckles] that is incredibly powerful.\nAnd I think,\nnot intended to disparage\nthe beautiful retinal work\nand conferring vision on\nsomeone who couldn't see,\nof course that's wonderful,\nand that's direct what you might call\ndirect optogenetics in patients.\nIndirect is everything that\ncomes from understanding.\nOkay, we know these cells\nmatter now, for this symptom.\nWell, how can we target those cells\nand help them work better\nin patients by any means?\nAnd I think that's the\nbroader significance\nof optogenetics, clinically.\n- I know Botond well,\nand you and Botond share\nthis incredible big vision,\nthat I think only a clinician\ncan really understand,\nbeing in close contact within\nthe suffering of patients\nas a ultimate motivator of\ndeveloping technologies,\nwhich makes me have to ask,\ndid you decide to become a scientist\nto find cures for mental disease?\n- [chuckles] No, I didn't.\nIt's a really important\nquestion to actually look back\nand see the steps that brought\nyou to a particular place.\nAnd that was not what brought\nme initially to science\nand it's okay I think,\nto embrace [chuckles]\nthe twists and turns\nthat life brings to you,\nbut I was always interested in the brain.\nAnd so, that was something\nthat for me started\nfrom a very early age.\nWe talked about being introspective.\nI noticed very early on I\nhad a deep love of poetry\nand stories, and I was a voracious reader,\nand I was amazed by how\nwords could make me feel\nin particular ways.\nEven separate from their, of\ncourse, dictionary meanings,\nthe rhythm, and how they work together,\neven separate from meaning.\nAnd I was stunned by poets that\ncould use words in new ways\nthat were even divorced\nfrom their meaning at all,\nand yet could still\ntrigger specific emotions.\nAnd this was always fascinating to me.\nSo, I wanted to understand that,\nand so I was interested and I\nbecame interested in the brain\nand I thought, well, I'm\ngoing to to have to study\nthe human brain, because only\nhuman beings can describe\nwhat's going on inside enough.\nSo in college, I began to\nsteer myself toward medicine,\nwith the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.\nAnd so I came here to medical school,\nand did an MD PhD program,\nplanning neurosurgery all the way through.\nThe first rotation I did at\nthe end of medical school,\nas you know, you do rotations,\nyou go through different specialties,\nand some of these are required rotations,\neverybody has to do this summary elective\nwhere you can pick what you want to do.\nI elected to do the\nneurosurgery first, [chuckles]\neven before regular surgery.\nI was that sure I wanted\nto do it, and I loved it.\nI had a fantastic time.\nThere was an amazing patient\nwho had a thalamic damage,\nand there was a neglect syndrome\nwhere the patient was not\nable to be aware of something\nthat was right in front of him-\n- Even though their\nvision was perfectly fine?\n- Even though their vision\nwas perfectly fine, exactly.\nAnd I loved the operating room,\nI loved the rhythm of suturing\nand the precision of it,\nand I loved being able to\nhelp patients immediately,\nbut then a required\nrotation was in psychiatry,\nwhich I was not looking forward to at all.\nAnd that completely reset my whole life,\nthat experience in psychiatry.\nAnd it was at that moment that I saw\nthis is first of all, the greatest need,\nthe depth of suffering\nand the depth of the mystery together.\nAnd also it was, I almost feel\na little guilty about this.\nIt's so interesting too.\nYes, we can help.\nYes, there's need, but as a scientist,\nthis is amazing, that someone's\nreality can be different\nfrom my own, with everything physically,\nas far as we can tell the same\nwith the measures we have,\nand yet we've got a different reality.\nThat is an amazing thing,\nand if we can understand that\nand help these people,\nthat would be just more\nthan anybody could ask for.\nAnd so that's how I ended\nup taking this path,\njust a required rotation in psychiatry.\n- It all started with poetry?\n- And it started with poetry.\n- Out of respect for poetry,\nare there any favorites\nthat you spend time with\non a regular basis?\n- I mean, the ones who\ngot me down this path\nearly on, I remember in\nchildhood and high school,\nBorges had an immense influence on me.\nI studied Spanish all the way\nthrough and reading his work.\nHe was a great writer.\nHe wrote both in English and in Spanish\nand being able to appreciate his poetry\nboth in English and in Spanish\nwas a pretty amazing thing.\nNot many poets can do that.\n- You're bilingual?\n- I'm not, I wouldn't say.\nNow I became, at one point\nI was effectively fluent\nin Spanish, and I'm pretty\ngood with medical Spanish still\nbecause we use Spanish all\nthe time in the clinic here.\nI wouldn't claim full fluency,\nbut it's something I can\ndefinitely use all the time.\nAnd that's been very\nhelpful in the clinic.\n- Yeah, Borges is wonderful.\nAs the son of an Argentine,\nI grew up hearing about it\nand I learned that Borges'\nfavorite city was Geneva.\nSo I spent time in Geneva\nonly for that reason.\nIt's also turns out\n[Karl laughs]\nto be an interesting city.\n- Yes.\n- So you developed\nmethods to control neurons\nwith these algae proteins using light?\n- Yeah.\n- In 2015, there was what I\nthought was a very nice article\npublished in the New\nYorker, describing your work\nand the current state of your work\nin the laboratory and the clinic,\nand an interaction with a patient.\nSo this as I recall, a woman\nwho was severely depressed,\nand you reported in that article\nsome of the discussion with this patient,\nand then in real time,\nincreased the activation of\nthe so-called vagus nerve,\nthis 10th cranial nerve that\nextends out of the skull\nand innervates many of\nthe viscera and body.\nWhat is the potential\nfor channelrhodopsins\nor related types of algae engineering\nto be used to manipulate the vagus?\nBecause I believe in that instance,\nit wasn't channelopsin stimulation,\nit was electrical stimulation, right?\nOr to manipulate for instance,\na very small localized\nregion of the brain?\nLet me frame it a little bit differently\nin light of what we were talking\nabout a couple minutes ago.\nMy understanding is that if\nsomebody has severe depression\nand they take any number\nof the available pharmaceutical\nagents that are out there,\nSSRI, serotonergic agents,\nincreased dopamine,\nincreased whatever, that\nsometimes they experience relief,\nbut they're often serious side effects.\nSometimes they don't experience relief,\nbut as I understand it,\nchannelopsins and their related\ntechnology, in principle,\nwould allow you to turn on\nor off the specific regions\nof the brain that lead to\nthe depressive symptoms,\nor maybe you turn up a happiness circuit,\nor a positive anticipation circuit.\nWhere are we at now in terms\nof bringing this technology\nto the nervous system?\nAnd let's start with the body,\nand then move into the skull.\n- Yup.\nSo starting with the\nbody is a good example\nbecause it highlights the opportunity\nand how far we have to go.\nSo let's take this example\nof vagus nerve stimulation.\nSo the vagus nerve, it's\nthe 10th cranial nerve.\nIt comes from the brain, it goes down\nand innervates the heart\nand innervates the gut.\nAnd by innervate, I mean it\nsends little connections down\nto help guide what happens in these organs\nin the abdomen and chest.\nIt also collects information back,\nand there's information coming\nback from all those organs\nthat also go through this vagus nerve,\nthe 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain.\nAnd so this is somewhat of a\nsuper highway to the brain,\nand it was the idea.\nAnd maybe the idea is maybe\nwe could put a little cuff,\na little electrical device\naround the vagus nerve itself,\nand maybe have just like\na pacemaker battery,\nhave a little power source\nhere under the clavicle,\neverything under the skin,\nand have a little cuff\nand drive signals, and maybe\nthey'll get back to the brain.\nSo a way of getting into the brain\nwithout putting something\nphysical into the brain.\n- And why the vagus?\nI mean, it's there and it's accessible-\n- That's the reason.\n- [chuckles] That's the reason?\n- [chuckles] That's the reason, yes.\n- Really?\n- Yeah.\n- You're not kidding?\n- [Karl] I'm not kidding.\n- So stimulating the\nvagus to treat depression,\nsimply because it's accessible.\n- It started actually\nas an epilepsy treatment\nand it can help with epilepsy,\nbut yes, it's simple.\n- God, you got to love medicine.\nAs a scientist, this is\nwhere I get to chuckle\nand you say, I'm in the field of medicine\nfrom that perspective.\nFrom the perspective of\na scientist and outsider,\nthe field of medicine\nis a field that goes in\nand tickles pathways\nbecause they're there.\nI don't know what to say.\nIt's a little shocking.\n- Yeah.\nAnd at least in my laboratory,\nI always say you never do an\nexperiment because you can,\nyou do an experiment to\ntest a specific hypothesis.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\nI mean, there are stories people tell\nso that the vagus nerve\nlands on a particular spot\non the brain called the\nsolitary tract nucleus,\nwhich is just one snaps\naway from the serotonin\nand dopamine and the norepinephrine-\n- So there's a link to\nchemical systems in the brain-\nthat make an irrational choice?\n- Yes.\nIt's not irrational,\nbut I can tell you that\neven if that were not true,\nthe same thing would have been tried.\n[Andrew laughs]\n- You guys would have done it anyway.\n- Because it's accessible. Yeah.\n- [Andrew] I see. Okay.\n- And why?\nWell, it's again, not to disparage\nwhat's been happening in\nthis branch of medicine.\nThere's immense suffering,\nmany treatments don't work,\nand we try things.\nAnd this is how so many\nadvances in medicine happen.\nWhen think about kidney dialysis\nwhich has kept many people alive,\nthat was just started by someone saying,\n\"Hey, let's try this.\nMaybe there's something\nbuilding up in the blood\nand maybe we can dialyze\nsomething and help them.\"\nYeah, it worked.\nAnd it was just sort of\na test pilot mentality.\nWe can access the blood,\nlet's run it across a dialysis membrane,\nput it back in the body, oh\nmy God, that actually works.\nAnd sometimes you do need\nthat test pilot mentality,\nof course, to do it in a rigorous, safe,\ncontrolled way-\n- Sure.\n- which is what we do.\nAnd so, anyway, that's how we ended up,\nbut still with the vagus\nnerve stimulation, okay,\nso what is it? Does it work?\nIt has, it's FDA approved for depression,\nthis vagus nerve stimulation,\nbut on a population level,\nif you average across all people,\nthe effect sizes are pretty small.\nSome patients it has an amazing effect in,\nbut some patients it doesn't work at all,\nand average across everybody,\nthe effect size is pretty small.\n- How do you think it's\nworking when it does work?\nIs it triggering the activation of neurons\nthat release more serotonin or dopamine?\n- It could be, but I would\nsay we don't have evidence\nfor that and so I just don't know.\nBut what is clear, is\nthat it's dose-limited\nin how high and strongly we can stimulate\nand why, it's because it's an electrode,\nand it's stimulating everything nearby.\nAnd when you turn on the\nvagus nerve stimulator,\nthe patient's voice becomes\nstrangulated and hoarse,\nthey can have trouble swallowing,\nthey can have trouble speaking for sure,\neven some trouble breathing,\nbecause everything in the neck,\nevery electrically responsive cell\nand projection in the\nneck is being affected\nby this electrode.\nAnd so you can go up just\nso far with the intensity,\nand then you have to stop.\nSo, to your initial question,\ncould a more precise stimulation\nmethod like optogenetics\nhelp in the setting?\nIn principle, it could,\nbecause if you would target\nthe light sensitivity\nto just the right kind of cell,\nlet's say cell X that goes\nfrom point A to point B\nthat you know, causes symptom\nrelief of a particular kind,\nthen you're in business.\nYou can have that be the only\ncell that's light sensitive.\nYou're not going to affect\nany of the other cells,\nthe larynx and the pharynx\nand the projections passing through.\nSo that's the hope,\nthat's the opportunity.\nThe problem, is that we\ndon't yet have that level\nof specific knowledge.\nWe don't know, okay, it's\nthe cells starting at point A\ngoing to point B, that relieves\nthis particular symptom.\n- We want to fix this key on the piano?\n- Yeah.\n- And then I see two other\nsteps that are required.\nOne is to get the channelopsin\ngene into the cell.\nIn the case of Botond Rosca and colleagues\nrescuing vision in this patient,\nthey did that by an injection of a virus\nthat doesn't damage the neurons.\nThe virus itself is fairly innocuous,\nbut carries a cargo, and\nit's a one-time injection,\nthe cells express, and then\nthey used light to stimulate.\nSo, let's say I'm depressed,\nwhich I don't think I am,\nalthough now sitting in\nfront of a psychiatrist,\n[Karl laughs]\nyou probably can see signs that maybe I am\nor maybe I'm not, but let's\nsay we put channelopsin\ninto a specific branch of\nthe vagus that we understand\nis responsible for mood,\nhow are we going to get it in there?\nAnd, then how are we going\nto deliver the light?\n'Cause we're not talking about sunlight\nor standing in front of\na light bulb necessarily,\nwhat are the mechanisms for the body?\n- Yeah.\nSo we had to solve exactly\nthese questions you're saying.\nHow do you get the light in?\nHow do you get the gene in,\nin a potent and robust and safe way?\nAnd that's now solved, and\nthat's not a challenge.\nSo there are very safe,\nwell-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms\nthat are called\nadeno-associated viruses, AAVs,\nand these are things that are associated\nwith the common cold.\nThey themselves don't cause any symptoms.\nThey've been engineered, and\nthere's been a broad community\nof viral engineering that's\nbeen going on for decades\nmaking these safer,\nwell-tolerated, and so on.\nWe can put the channelrhodopsin\ngene into these\nviral vectors that deliver the gene\nand we can have little\nbits of additional DNA\nthat govern expression\nonly in one kind of cell,\nbut not another.\nThese are called promoters and enhancers,\nall genetic tricks built up\nby a very broad community\nof great scientists over the decades.\nWe can put these different bits of DNA,\npackage them into this\nAAV, this little virus,\nand that can be then injected\ninto a particular part of the body,\nand sticking with this\nvagus nerve example,\nwe know that there are\nparticular clumps of neurons.\nThere's one called the nodose ganglion\nthat has a clump of cells\nrelated to the vagus nerve,\nand you could for example,\ntarget a little injection\ninto that ganglion-\n- Would that be an outpatient procedure?\n- Yep. Yep.\n- So you come in in the\nmorning, get your injection,\nmaybe walk out a few hours later?\n- Yeah. That's right.\nAnd so that's the gene,\nthen the light delivery,\nthis is also something\nthat we've worked out.\nWe've worked on making very,\nvery light-sensitive opsins.\nOne challenge, and Botond would\nbe the first to state this\nin fact, [chuckles] in solving\nthis problem for the patient,\nhe had to build goggles that\ncreated much brighter light\nthan the normal ambient light delivery,\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\nyou have to pack a lot of\nthese channelrhodopsins in,\nthey don't have much current.\nYou have to really make sure\nthat you've got a tense enough light\nto activate enough of them\nto cause a stimulation-\n- And it has to be the\nright wavelength, right?\n- It has to be the right wavelength-\n- And going back to your\nexample of the algae\nmoving toward or away the light,\nit has to be tuned just right.\nSo I'm imagining in my\nmind as a non-engineer,\nI know you're [chuckles]\nalso a bioengineer,\nI'm imagining a little tiny\nblue light-emitting object,\nthat's a little bigger\nthan a clump of cells,\nor maybe about the size\nof a clump of cells.\nAnd for those that don't know,\nyour credit card is about 200\nmicrons thick on the side,\nand a micron is a\nthousandths of a millimeter,\nand so we're talking\nabout a little tiny stamp\nthat's basically half a\nmillimeter in size all around.\nEach edge, half a millimeter in size.\nI can imagine that\nbeing put under my skin,\nand then I would what, I'd\nhit an app on my phone,\nand I'd say, \"Dr. Deisseroth,\nI'm not feeling great today.\nCan I increase the stimulation?\"\nAnd you'd say, \"Go for it.\"\nAnd then I'd ramp it up.\nIs that how it would go?\n- I mean, that's effectively\nwhat we already do\nwith the vagus nerve stimulation.\nThe doctor in this case, and I have this\nin some of my patients in the clinic,\nI do vagus nerve stimulation.\nI talk to them, I say, \"How are you?\"\nI go through the symptoms, I\nuse the psychiatric interview\nto elicit their internal states,\nand then I have a radio\nfrequency controller\nthat I can dial in-\n- Right there in real time?\n- Right there in real time.\n- You're holding the remote control\nessentially to their brain,\nalthough it's remote controlled?\n- Yeah, through a couple\nof steps, but yeah.\nAnd I can turn up the frequency,\nI can turn up the intensity,\nall with the radio frequency and control,\nand then it's reprogrammed or redosed,\nand then the patient can then\nleave at this altered dose.\n- So this is happening now?\n- This is happening\nright now, electrically.\n- You do this routinely?\n- I do it routinely in my\nclinic, electrically, yeah.\n- And you're getting the verbal content,\nwhich as you described\nearlier, is the indication\nof how well something\nis working in real time?\n- Yes.\n- So this is what, maybe\nyou could just describe\na little bit of the interaction\nwith that particular patient\nor another patient, what's a typical arc\nof narrative as you go from no stimulation\nto increased stimulation?\n- In most patients, the\nactual therapeutic effects,\nthe benefits actually\ntake many days to weeks,\nand so what I'm mostly\nfocusing on in the office\nin real time, is making sure\nI'm in a safe, low side effect regime.\nAnd so first I talk to the patient\nwho has been on a particular\ndose of the stimulation\nfor weeks or longer, and\nI talk about symptoms,\nhow were things over the past month?\nHow was your hope?\nHow was your energy level?\nSleep? What is your mood?\nAnd then we talk with the patient\nand we decide, well, this is\nnot yet where we'd like to be.\nAnd so then, I can turn up the\nintensity of the stimulation\nin real time in the office.\nIn most patients, I don't\nexpect an immediate mood change.\nWhat I do, is I increase the\ndose until a next level up,\nwhile asking the patient for side effects.\nCan you still breathe? Okay.\nCan you still swallow? Okay.\nAnd I can hear their voice as well.\nAnd I can get a sense-\n- And you're looking at their face?\n- And I'm looking at their face.\n- Yeah.\n- And so I can get a sense,\nam I still on a safe side effect regime?\nAnd then, I stop at a particular\npoint that looks safe,\nand then the patient goes\nhome, comes back a month later,\nand I get the report on how\nthings were over that month.\n- I asked if you're looking at their face,\n'cause in your book,\nyou describe the incredible complexity\nof social interactions.\nAnd at one point,\nyou describe the incredible\namount of information\nthat the eyes inform about the brain\nand the context of\nsomebody's inner experience,\nwhether depressed or happy or otherwise.\n- Yeah.\n- I want to make sure that we\nget back to how to maneuver\nand manipulate the nervous system\nfor the sake of mental health.\nBut, what are you looking for?\nSo as a vision scientist,\nI think pupils dilating\nis a sign of arousal,\nbut that could be a positive\narousal, positive valence,\nlike excitement, or it could be terror.\n- Yeah.\n- You're going to get the\nsame dilation of the pupils.\nAnd I'm always reminding people\nthat these two little goodies\nare two pieces of brain,\nbasically,\n[Karl chuckles]\nthey're just outside the cranial vault.\nSo they're not unlike\nthe vagus in that sense,\nbut they're more of a\nreport than a control knob,\nalthough I'd like to\nthink they could be used\nas control knobs too.\nSo, without putting you on the spot,\nagain, to diagnose me,\n[Karl laughs]\nthat's something I would\nnever ask you to do\n[Karl laughing]\nwith the cameras rolling,\nbut what are you looking for\nthat the patient might not be aware of?\nIn other words, can you see\ndepression in somebody's eyes?\nAnd if you know a patient or if you don't,\ncan you see it in their body\nposture when they walk in?\nRealizing of course, that\na trained psychiatrist\nlike yourself, develops an intuitive sense\nthat's aggregating lots of\ndifferent features of a patient,\nbut what about the eyes?\nWhat's going on there?\n- Yeah.\nThe eyes are incredibly\nrich in information.\nAnd as you alluded to though,\nit's not as if any one measurable\nconveys all the information you need.\nIt's what an engineer would\nsay, joint statistics.\nIt's many things all at once,\nwhether they're in synchrony\nor out of synchrony,\nthat actually turns out to matter.\nAnd the eye contact question,\nwe all know eye contact\nis incredibly important.\nYou don't feel you've\nconnected with somebody,\nunless there's eye contact, but\neye contact can go awry too.\nIt can be too intense,\nor it can be mistimed, or if\nthere's someone with autism,\nit can be barely there at all.\nAnd this is one of the most\nstriking symptoms of autism,\nis the avoidance of eye contact,\nalmost as if it's a harmful quantity.\nAnd so there's an immense\namount of information\nyou get from the eyes,\nbut it's the pairing of\nwhat's going on in the eyes,\nwith everything else going\non, the body language,\nthe verbal content of what's coming out.\nAll that together is the art of psychiatry\nand social interaction.\nBut sometimes you don't\nhave the eye contact.\nAnd this is an amazing thing\nand I do talk about this\nin the book as well.\nIn many cases in psychiatry,\nsometimes it's over the phone\nthat you have to make key decisions.\nAnd as I recall, vividly\nbeing as a resident,\nvery often you have to\ntake these phone calls\nfrom people who are not in the hospital,\npeople you can't see,\nyou can't see their eyes,\nyou can't see their body\nor anything about them,\njust the sound of their voice.\nAnd you can ask them questions,\nand you have to make, in some cases,\nlife or death decisions.\nIs this person truly suicidal?\nSomething like that, as\nit comes up all the time.\nAnd so I developed over\nthe course of training,\nand I think all psychiatrists do this,\nis you develop a way that\ndata stream you have,\nwhether it's the eyes or\nwhether it's just the sound\nof a voice coming over the phone,\nyou learn to hone in on\nthat data stream you have\nand focus on it and identify changes\nand it's quite amazing.\nI found that you can actually...\nIf you know a patient, you can\ndetect very precise changes\nin mood, just from the sound of the voice.\nAnd you can have a realization\nthat oh, this patient's\ndepression has improved\nby about half, just by\nthe tone of their voice.\nAnd same with eyes, with enough practice,\nyou can get enough information\nfrom a single data stream\nto give you some information,\nbut when you do have the whole picture\nof that, of course, is best.\n- So, so many theories out\nthere about excessive blinking\nand lying, lack of\nblinking and sociopathy.\nI like to remind people\nthat people have varying degrees\nof lubrication of the eyes,\n[Karl laughs]\nwhich also influence\nthe frequency of blinking and\npresumably have nothing to do\nwith whether or not what\nthey're saying is true or not.\nBut incredible, nonetheless,\nthat the eyes are a portal\nto overall arousal state.\nI'm fascinated by the effects\nof light on circadian biology\nand just overall desire to be\nawake or asleep, et cetera.\nSo the eyes are on the\noutside of the cranial vault.\nThe vagus is outside the\ncranial vault, obviously.\nWhat about the goodies in here?\nParkinson's, we know at\nleast one of the major sites\nof degeneration and failure\nthat lead to those symptoms.\nI can name off any number of other things.\nIn your book, you talk about\nthe beautiful work done\nwith optogenetics of active\nversus passive coping,\nthat there are areas of\nthe brain like the habenula\nthat when active, make\nanimals and presumably people,\npassive and unwilling, or\nuninterested in fighting back\nagainst pressures of life,\nwhereas another region,\nthe raphe, you stimulate\nthat, and they actively cope.\nThey get their grit going,\nand they are able to lean into life.\nSo, how does one get to those\nstructures in a focused way?\nAnd what does the next two to\nfive, to 10 years look like?\n- Well, this is the promise on that,\nand it is on a timescale\nthat I think things may start to play out.\nThe specificity of optogenetics\nis really only useful\nif you have some idea of\nhow to use that specificity.\nAnd actually, it's a\nfrustrating aspect of psychiatry\nthat in many cases, the most\neffective treatments we have,\nhave the least specificity,\nelectroconvulsive therapy\nbeing a great example,\nwhere you're causing a brainwide-\n- Which looks barbaric, but\nas you mentioned is effective.\n- I mean, it is.\nThese days, it's much\nmore clinically safe-\n- It doesn't look like one\nfluid there last seen in the lab\n[indistinct]\n- No it doesn't.\nNow it's a very clinically\nsafe and stable procedure,\nbut I would say yeah,\nit's got this almost\nmedieval lack of specificity,\neven if the procedure is\nwell-controlled and clinically safe\nand stable, and it's not very specific.\nYou're causing a brainwide seizure.\nHow could you be less specific than that?\n- And we don't know the\nsource of the relief.\n- [Karl] We don't know-\n- Presumably it's a\ndump of neuromodulators\nlike dopamine and serotonin,\nbut we don't really know-\n- There certainly is a\ndump of neuromodulators.\nWe don't know that that's\nthe cause for the relief.\nAnd likewise with medications,\nthis is an awesome and interesting thing.\nSome of the most\neffective antidepressants,\nsome of the most effective anti-psychotics\nare the ones that have\nthe most side effects\nand there are many examples of this.\nFor example, the most\neffective anti-psychotic\nis something called clozapine,\nwhich unquestionably has\nthe most side effects.\nIt has terrible, terrible side effects.\n- The D4 antagonist?\n- It has basically\nevery receptor. [laughs]\n- Does it really?\n- Yeah.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah, it has prominent\nserotonin, prominent muscarinic,\ncertainly acts on dopamine receptors,\nbut it causes blood cell\ncounts change- [laughs]\n- How do people feel?\nSo if I were schizophrenic\nand I was getting auditory\nhallucinations, et cetera,\nand I took clozapine, what\ncould I expect to feel?\n- Well, so you would notice side effects,\nand you would notice resolution\nof symptoms both and-\n- So the voices would go away?\n- Yeah.\n- But in a good situation,\nthe voices would go away?\n- That's right.\n- But I would feel not good in my body?\n- You might have dizziness,\nyou might have drooling,\nyou might have any number\nof physical sensations\nthat would be due to these\noff target effects, the medication acting\non these other receptors-\n- I'm certainly not suggesting this,\nbut what if somebody without\nschizophrenia took clozapine?\n- They'd have the same side\neffects presumably, yeah.\nAnd so it would not be something\nthat I would recommend.\n- Yeah.\nDo psychiatrists take the\ndrugs that they prescribe?\n[Karl laughs]\nI just finished for the third time,\nOliver Sacks' autobiography\nwhich is marvelous\nand I highly recommend to people.\nHe certainly took a lot of drugs,\nnot as part of his professional role,\nbut just out of curiosity,\nwhat is the interest\nor kind of role of drugs\nin the field of psychiatry?\nBecause I would imagine for a group\nof very curious introspective people\nwho are making recommendations\nabout what to take,\nthere could actually be some\nbenefit for understanding\nwhat the experience of\nthose drugs was like\nfor their patients.\n- I think that's true.\nAnd I will say that probably\nmany or most psychiatrists\nhave sampled the number of\nthese for exactly the reason\nthat you're saying is to understand better\nand to help treat their patients better.\nAnd I've spoken to people\nwho have found this very helpful to know,\nokay, this sleep disruption\ncaused by this medication\nor the libido disruption caused\nby this other medication.\nWow, that is a big effect.\nAnd it really helps with empathy\nfor the patients to understand.\n- I'm not suggesting that\nphysicians or anybody\nexperiment with drugs, but\nI am relieved to hear that,\nbecause I think that when you're talking\nabout accessing somebody's mind\nand their basic physiology,\nas you've mentioned, relate\nto appetite, libido and sleep,\nreally, one is acting as a mechanic\nof the person's whole experience.\nThey walk out of the office\nand they have a life experience\nthat extends beyond the script.\n- Yeah.\nAnd so at the same time though,\nyou can't let that completely\nguide your clinical decisions,\nbecause as I mentioned,\nsome of these medications\nthat have the most side effects,\nthey are also the most effective\nand clozapine is a great example.\nThat will work in patients\nwhere nothing else works.\nAnd believe me, we don't take the step\nof clozapine prescription lightly,\nbecause of all these side effects.\nYou have to come in for\na weekly blood cell,\nor every few weeks of blood cell check,\nto make sure that the blood\ncounts are not off for example,\nbut there are patients where\nno other medication works\nfor the schizophrenia and\nclozapine works amazingly well-\n- That's marvelous.\n- And so we do it, even though\nthere are the side effects.\nAnd so then this comes\nback to your question,\nwhat if we had better\nand better specificity?\nWell, only if we know exactly\nwhat we're doing is the point.\nAnd so because as we become more refined,\nwe'd better be right about\nwhere we we're refining to..\n- And do you imagine\na day where it will be\na single, maybe even\noutpatient neurosurgery,\nwould go in through the\nskull or the back of the ear,\ndeliver a small viral injection\nof one of these adenoviruses,\na little sticker of light-emitting diode,\ndeep in the brain, is that\nhow you envision this someday?\n- That certainly could happen.\nWhat I actually prefer as a\nvision is still medications,\nbecause those are minimally invasive.\nIf we knew what we were doing,\nwe could make them more specific,\nhave fewer side effects,\nbut optogenetics, that will arm us\nwith true causal understanding.\nAnd so we'll know,\nand we're already moving\nrapidly toward this point,\nwe'll know okay, this symptom,\nloss of pleasure in life\nthat we call anhedonia,\nor the loss of motivation or energy\nto overcome challenges, active coping,\nthese are largely subserved,\nlargely controlled\nby this circuit or that\ncircuit or the cell\nthat inhabits this other circuit.\n- And we will know that\nbecause of the work done\nwith channelopsins?\n- Exactly.\n- Yeah. I agree.\n- In ways that we never could\nhave the confidence otherwise.\nAnd so we'll know that this is the circuit\nthat underlies the\nsymptom or its resolution.\nAnd then we'll get to understand\nthese cells very deeply,\nokay, these cells that are\ncausal, that do matter,\nwho are they? What's their wiring?\nWhat are the proteins that they make?\nWhat are the little things\nthat are on the surface\nof the cell that could be\nreceptors for specific medications\nor combinations of receptors\nthat would give us the\nspecificity we need?\nAnd then, armed with\nthat causal and precise\nand rigorous knowledge,\nthen you can imagine\nmedication development\nbecoming totally different,\nno longer serendipitous, but\ntruly grounded in causality.\n- I see.\nSo using channelopsins as a\nway to probe the circuitry\nand figure out the sites\nthat are disrupted,\nwhat patterns of activity are required?\nAnd then, by understanding the\nconstituents of those cells,\nlike what they express and what they make,\nthen developing drugs that\ncould target those cells,\nnot necessarily putting\nlight-inducing diodes\ninto the brain, or walking\naround with wire packs\nattached to our skull\nor something like that.\n- [Karl] Right. Exactly.\n- That's fantastic.\nAnd I realized no one has a crystal ball,\nbut what do you think the arc of that is?\nMeaning, are we going\nto see that in a year?\nIn two years? Three years?\nLet me reframe that.\nHow soon will a pill-based treatment\nfor a psychiatric disease be available,\nthat targets a specific set of cells\nthat we know are important\nbecause of the work done\nwith channelopsins?\n- I think that in some\nways it's already happening\nat the level of individual patients-\n- Here at Stanford?\n- Yeah. Yup.\nAnd more broadly in terms of new drugs,\nnew multi-centered clinical\ntrials that will play out\nover the next few years.\nAnd these could be drugs\nthat are already safe\nand approved for other purposes,\nbut we might say okay, now we know\nthat this medication,\nbased on what we know\nfrom causal optogenetics,\nthis could be useful\nfor this other purpose,\nthis psychiatric symptom.\nAnd so the path to helping patients\ncould be relatively swift.\n- That's very exciting.\nWhat are your thoughts about\nbrain machine interface\nand Neuralink always comes up,\nalthough I do want to point\nout a tremendous respect\nfor the folks at Neuralink\nincluding someone who\ncame up through my lab,\nis now there as a neurosurgeon,\nbut the brain machine\ninterface is something\nthat's been happening for a long time now,\nsome of the best work, among\nthe best work being done here\nat Stanford and elsewhere too of course,\nis what you just described compatible with\nor different than brain machine interface,\nmeaning devices, little\nprobes are going to stimulate\ndifferent patterns of activity\nand ensembles of neurons?\nAnd what are your general thoughts\nabout brain machine\ninterfaces going forward?\n- I mean, first of all,\nit's an amazing scientific\ndiscovery approach,\nas you mentioned, we and\nothers here at Stanford\nare using electrodes,\ncollecting information\nfrom tens of thousands of neurons-\n- In humans, I should\nadd. Yeah. [chuckles]\n- And even, yes, it is quite even separate\nfrom the Neuralink work as you point out,\nmany people have been\ndoing this in humans,\nas well as in non-human primates.\nAnd this is pretty\npowerful, it's important.\nThis will let us understand\nwhat's going on in the brain,\nin psychiatric disease\nand neurological disease,\nand will give us ideas for treatment.\nIt is, of course still invasive.\nYou still are talking about\nputting a device into the brain.\nAnd that has to be treated\nas a situation that has some risks,\nand a step that has to be taken carefully.\nI see that as something\nthat will be part of\npsychiatry in the long run,\nalready with deep brain\nstimulation approaches,\nwe can help people with\npsychiatric disorders.\nAnd that's putting just\na single electrode,\nnot even a complex closed loop system\nwhere you're both playing in\nand getting information back,\neven just a single stimulation\nelectrode in the brain\ncan help people with OCD, for\nexample, quite powerfully.\nAnd that will become much more powerful\nwhen we get to a true\nbrain machine interface,\ncollecting information back,\nstimulating only when you need to.\nIf we could identify a\npathological activity pattern,\na particular, almost like the prodrome\nor the early stage of a seizure,\nmaybe there are events\nthat happened leading up to\non some timescale, a psychiatric symptom\nthat we could intervene\nin a closed loop way\nto detect what's happening,\nwhat's starting to go wrong,\nfeed that back to the brain\nstimulation electrode,\nhave it be in that way more\nefficient and more principled.\nI think it's great.\nIt's something that of\ncourse will be grounded again\nand causal understanding,\nwe'll need to know,\nwhat is that pathological\npattern that we're detecting?\nAnd we need to know that it matters.\nAnd so again, that's where\noptogenetics is helping us.\nIt's helping us know, okay,\nthis pattern of activity\nin these cells and these\ncircuits, this does mean\nthat there's a particular kind\nof symptom that's happening.\nBut armed with that knowledge, absolutely,\neven the simple closed loop\ndevice detect and stimulate\nis going to be part of\npsychiatry in the future.\nAnd then of course, as\nyou get to more cells,\nmore connections, the ability\nthat we have to help people\nwill become more powerful.\n- One of the questions I get\nasked a lot is about ADHD\nand attention deficit of various kinds.\nI have a hunch, that one\nreason I get asked so often\nis that people are feeling\nreally distracted and challenged\nin funneling their attention\nand their behavior.\nAnd there are number of\nreasons for that, of course,\nbut what is true ADHD, and\nwhat does it look like?\nWhat can be done for it?\nAnd what if any role for channelopsins\nor these downstream technologies\nthat you're developing,\nwhat do they offer for\npeople that suffer from ADHD\nor have a family member\nthat suffers from ADHD?\n- This is a pretty interesting\nbranch of psychiatry.\nThere's no question that\npeople have been helped\nby the treatments, there's active debate\nover what fraction of people\nwho have these symptoms\ncan or should be treated?\n- This is typically Adderall\nor stimulants of some kind?\n- Yeah, for example the\nstimulants, that's right.\nSo ADHD as its name\nsuggests, it has symptoms of,\nit can have either a hyperactive state\nor an inattentive state,\nand those can be completely\nseparate from each other.\nYou could have a patient who effectively\nis not hyperactive at all,\nbut can remain focused\non what's going on around them-\n- So the body can be still,\nbut their mind is darting around?\n- That's right.\n- Or they can be very\nhyperactive with their body.\n- Yeah, it happens both ways.\n- Probably rarely is somebody\nhyperactive with their body\nbut their mind is still,\n[Karl laughs]\nalthough I have to say,\nand this is a benevolent\nshout out to Botond Rosca,\nBotond has an incredibly\nsharp and focused mind.\n- Yeah.\n- And his hand movements\n[Karl laughs]\nare extremely exact also,\nso I do sometimes wonder, whether or not\nour body movements and our head movements,\nwhether or not they're coordinated or not\nis a readout of how\ndirected our attention is.\n- I noticed, I have to think\ncomplex, abstract thoughts.\nI noticed I have to be very still.\nSo my body has to be\nalmost completely on moving\nfor me to think very\nabstractly and deeply.\nOther people are different.\nSome people, when they're running,\nthey get their best thoughts.\nI can't even imagine that.\nMy brain does not work that way at all.\nI have to be totally motionless, [laughs]\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n- How do you go about that?\n- I sit much like this, I\ntry to have time in each day\nwhere I'm literally sitting\nalmost in this position,\nbut without distraction and thinking,\nand so it's almost\nmeditative in some ways,\nexcept it's not true meditation,\nbut I am thinking, well, I'm not moving-\n- You're trying to structure\nyour thoughts in that time?\n- Yeah.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah.\nSo, but everybody, as you\nsay is very different.\nAnd so with ADHD, the key\nthing is we want to make sure\nthat this is present across\ndifferent domains of life,\nschool and home, to show that it really\nis a pervasive pattern,\nand not something specific\nto the teacher or the home\nsituation or something.\nAnd then you can help patients.\nIt's interesting that ADHD\nis one of those disorders\nwhere people are trying to work\non quantitative EEG-based diagnoses,\nand so there's some progress\ntoward making a diagnosis\nlooking at particular,\nexternally detectable brainwave rhythm-\n- So skullcap with some electrodes\nthat don't penetrate the skull?\n- That's right.\n- And this can be done in\nan hour or two-hour session?\n- Yeah, that's right.\n- It has to be done in a clinic, right?\n- Yeah, in the clinic, right,\nand you have to have the\nright recording apparatus\nand so on,\nbut in principle, increase\nin confidence comes\nin exactly which measurements\none could even imagine\nmoving toward home tests,\nbut we're not there yet.\n- Amazing.\nI think one of the reasons\nI get asked about it so much\nis a lot of people\nwonder if they have ADHD.\nDo you think that some\nof the lifestyle factors\nthat inhabit us all these days,\ncould induce a subclinical\nor a clinical-like ADHD?\nI look at people's phone\nuse including my own,\nand I don't think of it like addiction,\nit looks to me and feels\nto me more like OCD.\nAnd I'll come clean here by\nsaying when I was younger,\nwhen I was a kid, I had a grunting tic.\nI used to hide it.\nI actually used to hide in the closet,\n'cause my dad would make me stop.\nAnd I couldn't feel any relief of my mind\nuntil I [grunts] would do this.\nAnd actually now, if I get very tired,\nif I've been pushing long\nhours, it'll come back.\n- Interesting.\n- I was not treated for it,\nbut I will confess that\nI've had the experience\nof, I always liked sports where\nI involved a lot of impact,\nfortunately not football,\nbecause I went to a high school\nwhere the football team was terrible.\nMaybe that would have avoided more impact,\n[Karl laughs]\nbut things like skateboarding, boxing,\nthey bring relief.\nI feel clarity after a\nhead hit, which I avoid,\n[Karl laughs]\nbut I used to say that's the only time\nI feel truly clear for a while.\nAnd then eventually it dissipated.\nBy about age 16, 17, it just disappeared.\nSo I have great empathy\nfor those that feel\nlike there's something contained in them\nthat won't allow them to focus\non what they want to focus on.\nAnd these days, with the phone\nand all these email, et cetera, I wonder\nand I empathize a bit\nwhen I hear people saying\nlike, \"I think I might have ADHD or ADD\".\nDo you think it's possible\nthat our behaviors\nand our interaction\nwith the sensory world,\nwhich is really what phones\nand email really are,\ncould induce ADD or reactivate it?\n- This is a great question.\nI think about it a lot,\nand you mentioned this\ntic-like behavior in yourself,\nit's very common that people who have tics\nhave this building up of something\nthat can only be relieved\nby executing the tic which\ncan be a motor movement\nor a vocalization or even a thought.\nAnd people do, I think\nthese days, do have this.\nIf they haven't checked\ntheir phone in a while,\nthey do have a buildup\nand buildup and buildup\nuntil they can check it and relieve it.\nAnd there's some similarities,\nthere is a little reward\nthat comes with the checking.\nBut the key question in all of psychiatry,\nwhat we do is we don't diagnose something\nunless it's disrupting what we call social\nor occupational functioning.\nLike you could have\nany number of symptoms,\nbut literally every\npsychiatric diagnosis requires\nthat it has to be\ndisrupting someone's social\nor occupational functioning.\nAnd these days, checking your\nphone is pretty adaptive.\nThat pretty much helps your social\nand occupational functioning.\nAnd so we can't make [chuckles]\nit a psychiatric diagnosis.\n- Interesting.\n- At least in the world of today.\n- Yeah, opting out of communication now,\nmakes you in some ways less adaptive,\nthough I would point to you as an example\nof somebody who is quite good\nat managing his interactions,\nat least from the outsider perspective,\nI do want to ask you a\nlittle bit about you.\nAnd first of all, and I realize\nthis is only a partial list,\nbut you're a clinician, you see patients,\nyou run a big laboratory,\nhow many people are in\nyour laboratory now?\nThat's a huge laboratory.\nFrom experience, I can say\nthat's an enormous laboratory.\nYou have a family of five children,\nand you're happily married to\na wonderful colleague of ours\nas well, who does incredible work.\nHow do you organize at a\nkind of conceptual level,\nthe day and the week?\nAnd I should say, what stress\nmitigation practices if any,\ndo you incorporate?\nI've received emails from\nyou at three in the morning.\nI sometimes send emails\nat three in the morning,\nbut that's when I wake\nup, maybe I'm depressed,\nbut I go back to sleep.\nSo, maybe just describe\nthe arc of the blocks\nof the day, not hour by hour,\nnecessarily the details of\nwhat are in those blocks,\nbut how do you conceptualize the day?\nHow do you conceptualize the week?\nAnd how do you feel\nabout how that's lined up\nwith your larger goals\nof making sure these five\nyoung people flourish?\nWhich I hear they are,\nbut how do you go about\nthis, what for most people\nwould just be an\noverwhelming set of items?\n- Well, of course sometimes\nit's just take it day by day,\nand so I don't claim-\n- So you bring the horizon\ninto the unit of the day?\n- I do, I do.\nThe unit is the day, that's right.\nAnd I try to have in each\nday, as I mentioned earlier,\nat least an hour of\ntime where I can think,\nand it can be when kids are napping,\nactually, because while\ndriving I can do that too,\nbecause I'm sitting still, [clears throat]\nbut that's the one\nthing I try to preserve.\nWhen I was writing the\nbook, I adapted that time\nto be my writing time,\nbut it wasn't enough,\nso I had to add in a new block of time\nwhich was sort of midnight\nto 2:00 AM, writing time.\n[chuckles] And carving out\nthese, even small protected times\nare very important.\nOf course, obligations will expand\nto fill the time available and\nyou have to be disciplined.\nAt least I found I had to be disciplined\nin truly protecting those\ntimes where one can think.\n- So that means no phone?\n- That means no phone,\nno checking of the phone.\nWhen I was writing the book,\nthere's a focus mode on the MacBook\nwhich kind of rules the border,\nand you just have your\ndocuments and it's very pure,\nand you don't have the\ntemptation of distraction.\n- I'm a big believer in because\nthe vision and the eyes play\nsuch a prominent role in\ndirecting our cognition,\nsomething you talk about in the book,\nreally beautifully, and with\na lot of depth and rigor,\nusing visual tools\nto harness one's complete\nmental attention.\nWhen you do this practice of\nsitting and just thinking,\nsitting still and thinking,\nyou said your eyes are open.\nAre you hearing your own verbal voice,\nalthough in your head?\n- Yes.\n- So you're actually in\nconversation with yourself?\n- Yes.\nAnd hearing literally, I\nmean, not quite literally,\nI don't actually hear information,\nbut I'm hearing words,\nand so I discovered this about myself.\nOther people, I think\nmay operate differently,\nbut I'm extremely verbal in how I think.\nThat's how all my reasoning is done.\nIt's with sentences and\n[chuckles] construction\nof almost equations with words.\n- Complete sentences?\n- Complete sentences\nor complete-ish anyway,\nmostly complete, and\nwhen writing the book,\neverything about the writing,\nevery sentence was always\nplayed out in my mind,\nlistening for rhythm and timing,\nand I would obsess over\nexact placement of words\nto get the right rhythm of the\nspoken sentence in my mind.\n- I don't mean to interrupt your flow,\nbut when you do that, and\nhaving experienced this process\na bit, although differently,\ndo you experience any kind\nof welling up of anxiety\nwhen you're hitting the friction points?\nAnd if so, do you have tools or ways\nthat you quell that anxiety in real time?\n'Cause what we're really\ntalking about here is your mind.\nBut what we're really\ntalking about is this process\nof converting the activity of neurons,\ninto something physically\nconcrete in the world.\nAnd these intermediate steps\nare so mysterious to everybody.\nWe hear, \"Just write the book\",\n\"Just do it\", whatever that means.\nIn fact, statements like that to me\nare kind of empty and meaningless,\nbut when you hear your voice\nand you're trying to find the correct word\nand you keep hitting, it\ndoesn't sound quite right,\nwhat is the experience in your body?\n- Yeah, when it's not right,\nit's definitely evasive,\nit doesn't feel good,\nbut there's also a hope because\nI know I can solve it too,\nand it's almost like you're almost there.\nThere's a path that you know is there,\nyou don't quite see it, but it's there.\nAnd I keep that in mind,\nand so there's this\npropulsive force forward\nbecause I know that the solution is there.\nAnd that said, there were single words\nthat I would spend days on,\nbecause I was just not\nhappy until I got it right.\nAnd there were some things\nthat I never quite got perfect,\nand so I left out of the book entirely\nbecause it was so close,\nbut not quite there.\nAnd I was like, no, I can't put that in.\n- Everything you just said\nis entirely consistent\nwith my experience of you,\n[both laughing]\nand the way you go about everything.\nI have to ask, are your kids writers?\nDo they like books and words and poetry?\nI know one of your children is going on\nto a career in medicine and science.\n- Yeah.\nThey're each different which is amazing,\nyet they all, I think do\nhave some appreciation\nor a lot of appreciation for reading,\nbut some are very musical.\nTwo of the five are extremely musical,\nvery, very talented with\nguitar and singing and vocal,\nimpressions, it's just astonishing.\nAnd some of them are great\nwith drawing and artistry\nand some are very physical and vigorous\nand are never happy\nexcept when leaping about.\nAnd so, it's just amazing how\ndifferent they are, honestly.\nBut I think there is a shared\nappreciation for language.\n- Do you think that one\ncan train their mind\nin using these practices?\nI really like your description\nof the staying physically still\nand learning to grapple\nwith those challenges.\nIt's something that, especially\nin laboratory science,\nwe aren't really trained to do.\nLike many professions\nwe're taught to come in\nand just get into motion, and\nI found that very relaxing\nas someone who probably\nhas an underlying tic\n[Karl chuckles]\nor something like that,\nit felt great to be in motion.\nOne of the hardest things\nabout becoming a university\nprofessor and running a lab,\nwas that I no longer\nworking with my hands.\nAnd it felt like some big\nimportant part of my life\nhad been amputated.\nBut what sorts of practices\ndo you incorporate there?\nAnd do you think people can\nlearn to get better at focusing\nthrough a dedicated practice\nof the sort that you described?\n- I remember the rhythms of physical work\nin the laboratory very well.\nMy work these days as\nthe laboratory leader,\nmy job has returned mostly\nto words now, again.\nAnd so it's kind of coming full circle.\nSo it's a different mode.\nI think you just have to\nembrace the different stages\nof life, come with the different modes,\nbut you can definitely train\nyourself for each mode.\nI loved, as I mentioned,\nthe rhythm of sewing\nand suturing and surgery,\nand I worked really hard on\nthat and became good at it.\nAnd now, I never do it, but\nit's what's the next challenge.\nThere's all the various\nexperimental techniques\nthe dissections of the brain,\nI can't tell you how many\nthousands of brain dissections\nI've done in my life, and\nnow I don't do them at all.\n[Karl laughs]\n- And then you developed a method\nso that we don't have to dissect brains.\n- That's right. [chuckles]\n- As you mentioned there,\nmaybe tell us for a moment about clarity,\nand for people who will\nprobably never set foot\ninto a laboratory, what an incredible,\nyet another incredible discovery\nand development clarity is,\nand why it helps us understand\nhow the brain is structured.\n- Yeah.\nSo this is a different technology\nalso developed in my lab\nhere, and it's part of a broader approach\nthat we call hydrogel-tissue chemistry.\nAnd what this is, is it's building a gel,\nlike a clear jello-like substance\nfrom within all the cells\nof a tissue or even an\nanimal, all at once.\nSo you're effectively building a gel\ninside all the cells at once.\nNow, that's an odd thing to do.\nWhy do we do it?\nWell, we do it to transform the tissue\ninto a more tractable accessible object.\nAnd the reason that works\nis having built this gel,\nthis new infrastructure inside the tissue,\nwe can then use chemical tricks,\nand we can link the\nmolecules we care about,\nlike proteins or RNAs\nwhich are the things,\nas you know, right before\nthey become proteins,\nwe can link them, physically\nanchor them to this gel,\nwhich is a scaffold basically,\nit's an interlocking network of polymers.\nWe can link all these\ninteresting molecules in place,\nlock them in where they were\ninitially in the tissue,\nin the cell, in all the cells.\nAnd then we can remove very vigorously,\neverything we don't care about\nthat's blocking our light,\nthat's blocking our molecules,\ncoming in to exchange\ninformation with the tissue.\nWe can get rid of everything\nelse, like the lipids,\nthe fats, we can\neffectively use detergents\nto get them all out,\nand then we can see in\nall the things that were\nabsorbing or scattering light\nare gone, you can have a brain\nthat's completely transparent,\nand yet, all the interesting\nmolecules are still locked\ninto place there, at the\ncellular and sub cellular level.\nAnd so this is hydrogel-tissue chemistry.\nThe first form we described\nwas called clarity.\nWe use that quite a bit still,\nbut there are many variants now,\nthat we and others have\ndeveloped on this basic concept\nof building this gel within the tissue\nand anchoring molecules into place.\n- Literally glass-clear brains.\nI've done this, I've taken a\nbrain cleared with this method,\nand looked at somebody through it,\n[Karl laughing]\nand although you don't want to\nget it too close to your eye,\nyou don't want to touch\nit to your own eye,\nand you can see direct\nall the way through it.\n- [Karl] Yeah.\n- That's incredible for it\nraises an important question,\nwhich is again, about the human brain,\nand as somebody who essentially\nstarted out in neuroanatomy\nand then got into other things,\nI always am bothered by the\nfact that we actually know\nvery little about the\nmicrostructure of the human brain,\ncompared to the brains of other organisms.\n- Yeah.\n- And in thinking about\nunderstanding the circuitry\nand the piano, so to speak\nand how to manipulate it\nin order to relieve suffering,\none wonders, are the structures\nin these animal brains\nand how they behave, and\nactive coping, passive coping,\nADD, et cetera, those models,\nhow well they translate\nto the human condition.\nDo you think it's fair to say\nthat there are entire regions\nof the human brain that\naren't just bigger,\nbut that exist only in\nthe brains of humans?\nEspecially given that we have this speech,\nalthough I do wonder sometimes\nif animals report in to each other there.\nMaybe they have little\npsychiatric sessions\nwith one another.\n- You know, I'm always\ncareful to not assume\nwe do things better.\nWe certainly understand what we're doing\nbetter than we understand\nwhat animals are doing,\nand they certainly do\nthings better than we do.\nThat said, we do have\namazing, wonderful brains\nand many structures that\nare very highly developed\nin our brains that are\nnot nearly so developed\nin mice and fish for example.\nNow, that said, when I\nlook at the big picture,\nwhat is the mammalian brain really doing?\nThere are things that you\nwould never have thought\nwe could study in animals and\nlaboratory mammals like mice,\nthat it turns out you can, actually,\nand so I would never draw the line\nand say, here's something\nyou can't study in mice,\nor here's something that\nhas no parallel in mice.\nI would be very careful\nbefore making any statement like that.\nAnd a good example of that\nis we've been able to study\njust in the past year,\ncome to an understanding\nof dissociation, and we had a paper\nthat came out in late 2020,\nboth mouse and human work,\nin which we got to the\nsort of the circuit basis\nfor dissociation.\nNow, what is dissociation?\nA lot of people might\nnot have experienced it,\nbut it's actually very common.\nMore than 70% of people\nwho've been through trauma\nexperience dissociation,\nit shows up in borderline\npersonality, it shows up in PTSD.\nWhat it is, is a separation\nof the sense of self,\nfrom the body.\nSo you can have someone who,\nit's not as if you're numb,\nyou're not anesthetized.\nYou can still know that\nsomething's happening to the body,\nbut you just don't care,\nbecause you don't ascribe it to yourself,\nwhich is very interesting, right?\nHow interesting is that?\n- The cells report narrative.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\n- In your book, you touch on this.\nAnd I will say is the most precise,\nand meaningful and eloquent description\nof what might be consciousness,\nthis narrative toward\nthe self or of the self,\nand where it might reside.\nSo in dissociative conditions,\npeople are feeling as kind\nof an absence of a merge\nbetween mind and body.\n- Right.\n- Is that one way to describe it?\n- That's right.\n- And as I recall,\nthis paper involved an\nexploration of ketamine.\n- Ketamine was a big part of it.\nYeah, that's right.\nAnd so ketamine is\nanother one of those cases\nwhere people can experience dissociation.\nKetamine or PCP, we call\nthese the dissociative drugs.\nThey cause it just like these\nother psychiatric conditions\ncan cause it.\nBut we were able to manifest this in mice,\nadministering these\ndissociative agents in mice.\nWe could make them still\nable to detect stimulus,\nbut not care that it was happening.\nAll the while we were recording\nthe activity of individual\ncells in the brain\nto see what was going on,\nwhat was happening along\nwith this dissociation,\nand then use optogenetics\nto see that it mattered\nto actually provide\nthat pattern of activity\nand see, oh, that actually\ncauses the dissociation.\nSo we could do all that in mice,\nwhich who would've thought\nthat you could study something\nlike this in mice?\nAnd we were able to go back\nand forth with human work\nbecause here in our Stanford\nComprehensive Epilepsy Center,\nthere's a lot of what we\ncall Stereo EEG Recording.\nPatients who come in\nand in the course of normal clinical care,\nthey have electrodes\nrecording in their brain\nto identify where the seizure is,\nso they can be candidates\nfor removing a little patch\nof the brain that's causing the seizure.\nThis has done for patients who\nmedications are not helping\ntheir seizure disorder.\nAnd there was a patient who\nhad a dissociative state\nbefore every seizure, so\nthis was a human being\nwho was really dissociating,\nwho could tell us literally\nas it was happening.\nAnd we could see this\npattern, the same pattern\nthat was happening in the\nmice, in the same patch\nof the brain, we could see that happening\nin the human being at\nexactly the right time,\nin the same patch of the\nbrain that's homologous\nacross these immense\nevolutionary distances.\nAnd we knew that it mattered\nto both the mouse and human\nbecause in the human we\ncould cause it to happen.\n- I just want to underscore the power\nof optogenetics and the ability\nto not just remove a particular\nexperience or behavior\nby lesioning or destroying,\nbut then to go back\nand actually activate same\nstructure or group of structures\nand see the emergences.\nSo essentially, these days you hear a lot\nabout gain of function research\nin the context of viral manipulation,\nbut gain of function is something\nthat we do in the laboratory\nand you do in patients, to\nboth take away something\nand put it back, which\ngives you causality.\n- That's right.\nYeah, and exactly.\nAnd so with optogenetics,\nwe were able to provide\nin animals without being\non any ketamine or any drug\nand we could cause the dissociative state\nby playing in a precise\npattern of activity.\nAnd who would have\nthought you could do that?\nBut that was a combined\nmouse and human paper.\nLikewise, we've been able\nto play in visual sensations\ninto the brains of mice,\nand by observing which cells\nin the visual part of\nthe brain, visual cortex,\nare naturally responsive to\nfor example, vertical bars,\ninstead of horizontal\nbars in the visual world,\nwe could see which cells\nwere normally reporting\non vertical bars, and then\nwe could use optogenetics\nto come and play in activity\njust to those cells.\n- So these animals are\nnot viewing anything?\n- Not viewing anything at all.\nAnd we could activate just\nthe vertical bar cells,\nand not only did the animal act\nas if it was seeing a vertical bar,\nbehaviorally, it was trained\nto do a particular thing\nif it saw a vertical bar, and it did that,\njust as if it was seeing\nsomething visually.\nBut everything in the brain\nthat we were recording\nto the internal representation\nof this external world\nwas naturalistic too.\nIt looked like the brain\nwas seeing something visual.\nSo that's gain of function too, you know,\nplaying in, providing a\ncomplex sensation or percept\nthat wasn't there before.\nAnd we can do that across species.\nSo, and of course mice are social,\nand they do amazing acts\nof information processing\nand I try not to disparage\nour cousins too much.\n- They certainly have helped\nthe field of neuroscience\nand medicine I should mention,\nand I know that people\nhave various sensitivities\nabout animal research, but the\nwork that's been carried out\nin mice has been absolutely\nvital and instructional\nfor treatment of human disease.\n- That's right.\n- Since we talked about\ndissociation and dissociative states\nrather and ketamine,\nI'd love your thoughts\non psychedelic medicine.\nYou know, I sort of half joke\nhaving grown up in this area\nin Northern California when it\nwas much more counter-culture\nthan it is now, that many of the things\nthat we're hearing about now,\nat least from my read\nof the history books,\nhappened before.\nThere was a movement\naimed at taking the very\nsame compounds essentially,\nputting them into patients\nor people who were obviously\nusing them recreationally,\nbut putting them into patients,\nand seeing tremendous positive effects,\nbut also tremendous examples\nof induced psychiatric illness.\nIn other words, many\npeople lost their minds\nas a consequence of\noveruse of psychedelics.\nI'll probably lose a few people out there,\nbut I do want to talk\nabout, what is the state\nof these compounds?\nAnd I realize it's a huge\ncategory of compounds,\nbut LSD and psilocybin, as I\nunderstand trigger activation\nof particular serotonin\nreceptor mechanisms,\nmay or may not lead to\nmore widespread activation\nof the brain that one\nwouldn't see otherwise.\nBut when you look at the clinical\nand experimental literature,\nwhat is your sort of top contour sense\nof how effective these\ntools are going to be\nfor treating depression?\nAnd then if we have the time,\nwe could talk about trauma\nand MDMA and some of that work.\n- Well, you're right to\nhighlight both the opportunity\nand the parallel that is there.\nAnd of course we want to help patients\nand of course we want to explore anything\nthat might be helpful,\nbut we want to do it in\na safe and rigorous way.\nBut I do think we should\nexplore these avenues.\nThese are agents that alter reality\nand alter the experience\nof reality I should say,\nin relatively precise ways.\nThey do have problems,\nthey can be addictive,\nthey can cause lasting\nchange that is not desirable,\nbut we have to see these as opportunities.\nWe have to first of all,\nstudy in the laboratory,\nand I'm doing this here.\nYou know we have [chuckles] big...\nWe have safes with many\ninteresting psychedelics\nthat are all very carefully regulated.\nWe get inspections from the DEA and so on.\n- If anyone's hoping to find these labs,\n[Karl laughing]\nthey exist in outer space,\nso you need to be on board\none of the SpaceX missions\nin order to access them.\nSo don't try and come find them.\n- No, that's exactly true. Yes.\nAnd we're doing exactly this.\nWe're saying this is an\nincredible opportunity.\nIf we could understand how\nthe perception of reality is altered,\nwe could be creating new\nkinds of intervention\nthat don't have the risks\nand the problems of causing\nlasting change or addiction.\nNow, that said, even as\nthese medications exist now,\nas you know, there's\nan impulse to use them\nin very small doses and to use\nthem as adjunctive treatments\nfor the therapy of various kinds.\nAnd I'm also supportive\nof that if done carefully\nand rigorously, of course there's risk,\nbut there's risk with many\nother kinds of treatments.\nAnd I'm not sure that the\nrisks for these medications\nvastly outweigh the risks\nthat we normally tolerate\nin other branches of medicine.\n- Why would they work?\nI mean, let's say that\nindeed their main effect\nis to create more connectivity,\nat least in the moment\nbetween brain areas.\nSo the way I think about the two extremes\nof my experience anyways,\na high degree of stress and\nfocus for whatever reason,\nis going to create\nchanges in my visual field\nand changes in the way\nthat I perceive times,\nso that I'm on a micro-sliced time,\nI might be in a very contracted view\nof whatever my experience is,\nwhereas on the opposite\nextreme in a dream or in sleep,\nspace and time are very fluid,\nand I'm essentially relaxed,\nalthough it might be a\nvery interesting dream,\nor it might not be.\nPsychedelics seemed to be a trajectory.\nI'm not too far off from the dream state\nwhere space and time are\nessentially not as rigid.\nAnd there is this element of synesthesia,\nblending of the senses, you know,\nfeeling colors and hearing\nlight and things of that sort.\nYou hear these reports, anyway.\nWhy would having that\ndream-like experience\nsomehow relieve depression, long-term?\nDo we have any idea why that might be?\n- Yeah.\nWe have some ideas, and\nno deep understanding.\nOne way I think about the psychedelics\nis they increase our willingness to...\nThey increase the willingness of our brain\nto accept unlikely ways\nof constructing the world,\nunlikely hypothesis, as it\nwere, as to what's going on.\nThe brain, in particular\nour cortex, I think,\nis a hypothesis generation\nand testing machine.\nIt's coming up with\nmodels about everything.\nIt's got a lot of bits of data coming in,\nand it's making models\nand updating the models\nand changing them, theories,\nhypothesis for what's going on.\nAnd some of those never\nreach our conscious mind.\nAnd this is something I\ntalk about in \"Projections\"\nin the book quite a bit, is\nmany of these are filtered out\nbefore they get to our\nconscious mind, and that's good.\nThink how distracted we'd be\nif we were constantly\nhaving to evaluate all these\nhypotheses about what\nkinds of shapes or objects\nor processes were out there.\nAnd so a lot of this is handled\nbefore it gets to consciousness.\nWhat the psychedelics seem to do,\nis they change the threshold\nfor us to become aware\nof these incomplete hypotheses\nor wrong hypotheses,\nor concepts that might be\nnoise but are just wrong,\nand so are never allowed to\nget into our conscious mind.\nNow, that's pretty interesting,\nand it goes wrong in\npsychiatric disorders.\nI think in schizophrenia\nthere's some of the times\nthe paranoid delusions that people have\nare examples of these poor models\nthat escape into the conscious mind\nand become accepted as reality\nand they never should've gotten out there.\nNow, how could something\nlike this in the right way,\nhelp with something like depression?\nPatients with depression often are stuck.\nThey can't look into the\nfuture world of possibilities\nas effectively.\nEverything seems hopeless.\nAnd what does that really mean?\nThey discount the value\nof their own action,\nthey discount the value of the world\nat giving rise to a future that matters.\nEverything seems to run out like a river\njust running out into\na desert and drying up,\nand what these agents may do\nthat increase the flow through\ncircuitry, if you will,\nthe percolation of\nactivity through circuitry\nmay end up doing for depression\nis increasing the escape of some tendrils\nof process of forward\nprogression through the world.\nThat's a concept, that's\nhow I think about it.\nThere are ways we can make that rigorous.\nWe can indeed identify in\nthe brain by recording,\nwe can see cells that\nrepresent steps along a path\nand look into the future,\nand we can rigorously define these cells\nand we can see if these are\naltered on psychedelics.\nAnd so that's one of the reasons\nthat we're working with these\nagents in the laboratory\nto say, all right, is\nthis really the case?\nAre these opening up new paths\nor representations of\npaths into the future?\n- MDMA, ecstasy is a unique compound\nin that it leads to big increases\nin brain levels of dopamine\nand serotonin simultaneously.\nAnd I realized that the neuromodulators\nlike dopamine and serotonin\noften work in concert,\nnot alone, the way\nthey're commonly described\nin the more general popular discussions.\nHowever, it is a unique compound,\nand it's different than\nthe serotonergic compounds,\nlike LSD and psilocybin.\nAnd there are now data,\nstill emerging that it might be,\nand in some cases can be useful\nfor the treatment of trauma,\nPTSD and similar things.\nWhy would that work?\nAnd a larger question, perhaps\nthe more important question\nis, psychedelics, MDMA,\nLSD, all those compounds,\nin my mind there are two components.\nThere's the experience you\nhave while you're on them,\nand then there's the\neffect they have after.\nPeople are generating\nvariations of these compounds\nthat are non-hallucinatory variations.\nBut, how crucial do you think it is\nto have, let's stay with MDMA,\nthe experience of huge levels of dopamine,\nhuge levels of serotonin,\natypical levels of dopamine\nand serotonin released,\nhaving this highly abnormal experience\nin order to be normal again?\n- Yeah.\nI think the brain learns\nfrom those experiences.\nThat's the way I see\nit, and so for example,\npeople who have taken MDMA,\nas you say, there will be the acute phase\nof being on the drug\nand experiencing this\nextreme connectedness\nwith other people for example,\nand then the drug wears off,\nbut the brain learned\nfrom that experience.\nAnd so what people will report is,\nyeah, I'm not in that state,\nbut I saw what was possible.\nI saw it. Yeah.\nThere don't need to be barriers,\nor at least not as many\nbarriers as I thought.\nI can connect with more people\nin a way that that is helpful.\nAnd so I think it's the learning\nthat happens in that state,\nthat actually matters.\n- And as you described that,\nthat sounds a lot like what I understand\nto be the hallmark feature of\nreally good psychoanalysis,\nthat the relationship between\npatient and therapist,\nhopefully evolves to the point\nwhere these kinds of tests can be run\nwithin the context of that relationship,\nand then exported to other relations.\n- Exactly right. Yeah.\n- And that probably, I'm assuming\nis still the goal of really\ngood psychiatry also.\n- As a part of-\n- Intimacy, really.\n- It should be.\nWhen we have time, I think\nall good psychiatrists\ntry to achieve that level\nof connection and learning,\ntry to help patients create\na new model that is stable,\nthat is learned, and that can\nhelp instruct future behavior.\n- One of the things that I\ntook from reading your book,\nin addition to learning so much science\nand the future of psychiatry\nand brain science was,\namidst this very tragic cases and sadness,\nand a lot of the weight that\nthat puts on the clinician,\non you also, that there's\na central cord of optimism,\nthat where we're headed\nis not just possible\nbut very likely, and better.\n- Yeah.\n- And, are you an optimist?\n- [chuckles] I am.\nAnd by the way, this was a\nreally interesting experience\nin writing \"Projections\",\nbecause I had a dual goal.\nI wanted it to be for everybody,\nliterally everybody in the\nworld who wants to read it.\nAnd yet at the same time,\nI wanted to stay absolutely\nrigorously close to the science,\nwhat was actually known, when\nI was speaking about science.\nWhen I was speaking about\nthe neurobiology of the brain\nor psychiatry, I wanted to not have\nany of my scientific colleagues\nthink, oh, he's going too\nfar, he's saying too much.\nAnd so I had these two goals\nwhich I kept on my mind the entire time.\nAnd a lot of this trying to\nfind exactly the right word\nwe talked about was, on this path\nof staying excruciatingly\nrigorous in the science\nand yet, letting people see the hope,\nwhere things were, have everybody see\nthat we've come a long way,\nwe have a long way to go,\nbut the trajectory and\nthe path is beautiful.\nAnd so that was the goal, I think.\nOf course that sounds almost impossible\n[chuckles] to jointly\nsatisfy those two goals,\nbut I kept that in my mind\nthe whole way through.\nAnd yes, I am optimistic\nand I hope that it came\nthrough in the book\n- It certainly did, and at\nleast from this colleague,\nyou did achieve both.\nAnd it's a wonderful, it's\na masterful book, really,\nand one that as a scientist\nand somebody who is a\nfellow brain explorer,\nhits all the marks of rigor\nand is incredibly interesting\nand there's a ton of storytelling.\nI don't want to give\naway too much about it,\nbut people should definitely\ncheck out the book.\nAre you active on social media?\nIf people want to follow you\nand connect with what you're\ndoing now and going forward?\n- Yeah. I have Twitter.\nThat's where I mainly do exchange,\ntell people about things\nthat are happening.\n- We'll provide a link to it,\nbut that's Karl Deisseroth,\nas I recall, with a K?\n- That's right.\n- Yeah.\n- That's right.\n- And so you're on Twitter,\nand people will hear this,\ndefinitely check out the book.\nThere are other people in our community\nthat of course are going to be\nreaching out on your behalf,\nbut it's incredible that you juggle\nthis enormous number of things,\nperhaps even more important however,\nis that it's all in service\nto this larger thing\nof relieving suffering.\nSo thank you so much for your time today,\nfor the book, and the\nwork that [chuckles] went\ninto the book, I can't even imagine,\n[Karl laughs]\nfor the laboratory work\nand the development of\nchannelopsins, clarity,\nand all the related technologies\nand for the clinical work you're doing\nand for sharing with us.\n- Well, thank you for all\nyou're doing in reaching out.\nI'm very impressed by it.\nIt's important and it's so valuable,\nand thank you for taking the time\nand for all your gracious\nwords about the book.\nThank you.\n- I hope you enjoyed today's\ndiscussion with Dr. Deisseroth\nas much as I did.\nBe sure to check out his new book,\n\"Projections: A Story of Human Emotions\".\nIt's available on Amazon, Audible,\nand all the other standard\nplaces where books are found.\nIf you'd like to support this podcast,\nplease subscribe to us on YouTube.\nAs well, you can subscribe\nto us on Apple or Spotify.\nAt Apple, you also have the opportunity\nto leave us a five-star review,\nand to give us feedback.\nPlease put any questions you\nhave in the comment section\nbelow the YouTube video,\nif you'd like us to address certain things\nin future episodes, or\nif you have questions\nabout this particular episode.\nIn addition, please\ncheck out our sponsors.\nThat's a terrific way to support us.\nWe also have a Patreon, it's\npatreon.com/andrewhuberman.\nThere you can support us at\nany level that you'd like.\nLast but not least, if you're\ninterested in understanding\nmore about how the brain\nworks and how it functions,\nand how it breaks down\nin various conditions,\ncheck out the first episode\nof the \"Huberman Lab Podcast\".\nThe title of that episode\nis \"How your nervous\nsystem works and changes\".\nIf you're watching this\nright now on YouTube,\nyou can simply click on the\ntitle card for that episode.\nAnd last but not least,\n[upbeat music]\nthank you for your interest in science."
