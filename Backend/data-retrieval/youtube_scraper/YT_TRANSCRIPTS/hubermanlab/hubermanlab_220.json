    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[gentle music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat in my opinion are the\nabsolute best out there.\nThe sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are made by Roka\nhave a number of properties\nthat are really unique.\nFirst of all, they're\nextremely lightweight,\nyou never even notice\nthat they're on your face.\nSecond, the optical clarity is fantastic.\nOne of the things that's\nreally hard to accomplish,\nbut that Roka succeeded in accomplishing\nis making sunglasses that you can wear\nin lots of different environments.\nAs you move from bright to\nshadowed regions for instance,\nor as the amount of sunlight changes\nmany eyeglasses will make it such\nthat it's hard to see your environment\nand you need to take the eyeglasses off,\nor you can't see or detect borders.\nWith Roka sunglasses,\nall of that is seamless,\nthey clearly understand\nthe adaptation mechanisms\nand habituation mechanisms,\nall these fancy details\nabout the human visual system\nhave allowed them to design a sunglass\nthat allows you to be in any environment\nand to see that\nenvironment extremely well.\nThe eyeglasses are terrific,\nI wear readers at night\nand again, they just make the\nwhole experience of reading\nor working on a screen\nat night very, very easy,\nvery easy on the eyes.\nThe aesthetic of the eyeglasses\nand sunglasses is also suburb.\nYou know, I chuckle sometimes\nwhen I see sports frames\nor sports glasses,\na lot of them just look\nridiculous frankly,\nbut the Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nhave a terrific aesthetic,\nthey have a huge variety to select from.\nIf you'd like to try Roka glasses,\nyou can go to Roka,\nthat's roka.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nand you'll get 20% off your first order,\nthat's roka.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto get 20% off your first order.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be detected from\na quality blood test.\nOne of the major problems\nwith blood tests however\nis that oftentimes you'll\nget information back\nabout levels of metabolic\nfactors, hormones, et cetera,\nand there won't be any directives\nabout what to do with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, it\nmakes all of that very easy.\nFirst of all, they can come to your home\nto do the blood test and DNA test\nor you can go to a local clinic,\nthey make that very easy.\nSecond of all, when you\nget the information back\nabout the levels of hormones,\nand metabolic factors, and\nother things in your blood\nit gives you simple directives.\nThey have a dashboard\nthat allows you to assess\nfor instance, whether or not\nyou ought to make changes\nin your nutrition, or\nchanges in your exercise,\nor changes in your sleep regimen,\nany number of different lifestyle factors\nthat can help bring the\nmarkers and the various factors\nin your blood and DNA to\nthe appropriate levels.\nSo, really they're putting you\nin the driver's seat for your health.\nIn fact, one of the\nlisteners of this podcast\ncontacted me recently and said\nI took an InsideTracker test,\nI felt like I was in great health,\nbut I noticed from the test\nthat I had high CRP, C-reactive protein.\nC-reactive protein is a\nmarker that if it's too high\nis a cautionary note\nabout various cardiac\nand even eye diseases,\nso it's something that they\nare now taking actions on\nas a consequence of getting\ntheir blood work done\nand taking the InsideTracker test.\nSo, I think that's just\none of many examples\nthat we hear about.\nI have examples from my own life\nfor instance of different\nfactors in my blood being off\nand making adjustments to nutrition\nand other aspects of my life\nthat have allowed me to bring\nthose into the proper range.\nSo, if you care about your health\nInsideTracker may very\nwell be right for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans,\njust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,\nmineral probiotic drink.\nI've been using Athletic Greens since 2012\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nAthletic Greens is terrific\nbecause it covers your nutritional bases.\nIf I drink Athletic Greens once\nand I sometimes drink it twice a day,\nthen I'm sure that all\nthe vitamins I need,\nI'm getting those.\nAll the minerals I\nneed, I'm getting those,\nand the probiotics.\nThere's now a ton of data\nshowing that a healthy gut microbiome\nis vital to brain function,\nvital to immune function,\nand vital to all aspects of our health.\nSo with Athletic Greens,\nyou get the vitamins,\nthe minerals, and the probiotics\nto cover all your bases.\nIn fact, anytime people ask\nme what should they take\nor what could they do\nto support their health,\nprovided that they\nalready have their sleep\nand other aspects of their life in order,\nAthletic Greens is the\nthing that I recommend\nbecause it covers all the\nfoundations, all the bases\nof what one really wants from a supplement\nwithout having to take a\nton of different things.\nIt also tastes great,\nalmost everybody that tries it\nand then reported back to me has told me\nthat they really liked the taste.\nI mix mine with water,\na little bit of lemon and lime juice,\nand I really like the\ntaste, it's delicious to me.\nI drink it once or twice a day.\nIt's keto compatible,\nit's compatible with\nmost fasting regimens,\nit's compatible with if you're a vegan\nor if you're not vegan, it's compatible\nwith essentially every\nnutritional plan out there,\nso it's just a terrific\nall around supplement\nand benefit to one's health and diet.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nclaim a special offer,\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it easy to\nmix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nand they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nThis month, we've been\ntalking about the senses,\nhow we detect things in our environment.\nThe last episode was all about vision,\nhow we take light and\nconvert that information\ninto things that we can perceive\nlike colors, and faces, and motion,\nthings of that sort\nas well as how we use\nlight to change our biology\nin ways that are subconscious\nthat we don't realize,\nthings like mood, and metabolism,\nand levels of alertness.\nToday, we're going to talk\nabout chemical sensing,\nwe're going to talk\nabout the sense of smell,\nour ability to detect\nodors in our environment.\nWe're also going to talk about taste,\nour ability to detect chemicals\nand make sense of chemicals\nthat are put in our mouth\nand into our digestive tract.\nAnd we are going to talk about chemicals\nthat are made by other human beings\nthat powerfully modulator\nthe way that we feel,\nour hormones, and our health.\nNow, that last category are\nsometimes called pheromones.\nHowever, whether or not\npheromones exist in humans\nis rather controversial,\nthere actually hasn't been a clear example\nof a true human pheromonal effect,\nbut what is absolutely\nclear, what is undeniable\nis that there are chemicals\nthat human beings make\nand release in things\nlike tears onto our skin,\nand sweat, and even breath\nthat powerfully modulate\nor control the biology\nof other individuals.\nIn fact right now, even if\nyou're completely alone,\nyour chemical environment\ninternally is being controlled\nby external chemicals,\nyour nervous system, and your\nhormones, and your metabolism\nare being modified by\nthings in your environment,\nso we're going to talk about those.\nIt's an absolutely fascinating\naspect to our biology,\nit's one of our most primordial,\nmeaning primitive aspects of our biology,\nbut it's still very\nactive in all of us today.\nThis episode, believe it or not,\nwill have a lot of tools,\na lot of protocols.\nEven though I'm guessing most of you\ncan probably smell your\nenvironment just fine,\nthat you know what you like\nto eat and what tastes good,\nand what doesn't taste good to you,\ntoday's episode is going\nto talk about tools\nthat will allow you to actually leverage\nthese chemical sensing mechanisms,\nincluding how you smell\nnot how you smell in\nthe qualitative sense,\nbut how you smell in the verb sense,\nthe action of sniffing and smelling\nto enhance your sense of smell\nand to enhance your\nsense of taste as well,\nbelieve it or not, to\nenhance your cognition,\nyour ability to learn and remember things.\nEverything we're going\nto talk about as always\nis grounded in quality\npeer-reviewed studies\nfrom some excellent laboratories,\nI'll provide some resources along the way,\nso that means tools and protocols\nand also basic information.\nYou're going to learn\na ton of neuroscience\nand lot of biology in general.\nAnd I think what you'll\ncome to realize by the end\nis that while we are clearly different\nfrom the other animals,\nthere are aspects to our\nbiology that are very similar\nto that of other animals\nin very interesting ways.\nBefore we dive into chemical sensing,\nI want to just briefly\ntouch on a few things\nfrom the vision episode.\nOne is a summary of a protocol.\nSo, I covered 13 protocols last episode,\nif you haven't seen that\nepisode, check it out.\nThose protocols will\nallow you to be more alert\nand to see better over\ntime if you follow them.\nAll of them are zero cost,\nyou can find any and all\nof them at hubermanlab.com,\nthere's a link to those videos\nand tools and protocols,\neverything is timestamped.\nThe two protocols that I just\nwant to remind everybody of\nare the protocol of near-far\nviewing that all of us\nregardless of age, should\nprobably spend about five minutes\nthree times a week, doing some\nnear-far viewing exercises.\nSo, that would be bringing a pen or pencil\nup close to the point where\nyou're about to cross your eyes,\nbut you don't cross your eyes\nand then out at some distance.\nAnd then look beyond that pen\nor other object that you're using\noff as far as you can into the distance.\nIt would be great if you could\ndo this on a balcony or deck\nand then look way off in the distance\nand then bring it back in.\nThis is going to exercise\nthat accommodation reflex,\nthe change in the shape of the lens\ncan help offset a number of things\nincluding myopia, near-sightedness.\nThe other one is this incredible study\nthat showed that two hours a day outside,\neven if you're doing other\nthings while you're outside\ncan help offset myopia, nearsightedness.\nSo, try and get outside,\nit's really the sunlight\nand the blue light, right?\nEveryone's been demonizing\nblue light out there,\nbut blue light is great\nprovided it's not super, super bright\nand really close to your eyes.\nBlue is terrific if it\ncomes from sunlight.\nTwo hours a day outside\nis going to help offset\nmyopia, nearsightedness.\nNow, that's a lot of time,\nI think most of us are\nnot getting that time,\nbut since you can do other\nthings like gardening,\nor reading, or walking, or running.\nIf you can get that two hours outside\nyour visual system and\nyour brain will benefit.\nI also would like to\nmake one brief correction\nto something that I said incorrectly\nin the previous episode.\nAt the end of the episode,\nI talked about lutein,\nand how lutein may help offset\nsome moderate to severe\nage-related macular degeneration.\nAs well, I talked about how some people\nare supplementing with lutein\neven though they don't have\nage-related macular degeneration\nwith the idea in mind\nthat it might help offset some vision loss\nas they get older.\nI said lutein, and lutein\nwas the correct thing to say,\nbut once or twice, when\nI started speaking fast\nI said leucine and not lutein.\nI want to emphasize that leucine,\nan amino acid, very interesting,\nimportant for muscle building\ncovered in previous episodes,\nbut lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N,\nis the molecule and compound\nthat I was referring to\nin terms of supplementing\nfor sake of vision.\nSo I apologize, please\nforgive me I misspoke,\na couple of you caught that right away,\nin listening to the\nepisode after it went up\nI realized that I had misspoken.\nSo, lutein for vision,\nleucine for muscles, and muscle growth,\nand strength, et cetera.\nBefore we dive into the\ncontent of today's episode,\nI want to just briefly\ntouch on color vision.\nMany of you asked questions\nabout color vision\nand color perception.\nAnd indeed color perception\nis a fascinating aspect\nof the human visual system,\nit's one of the things\nthat makes us unique.\nThere are certainly\nother animals out there\nthat can detect all the\ncolors of the rainbow,\nsome can even detect into the\ninfrared, into the far-red\nthat we can't see,\nbut nonetheless, human color vision,\nprovided that somebody isn't colorblind,\nis really remarkable.\nAnd if you're interested in color vision\nor you want to answer questions\nabout art or about for instance\nwhy that dress that showed\nup online a few years ago\nlooks blue to you and\nyellow to somebody else.\nAll the answers to that\nare in this terrific book\nwhich is \"What Is Color?:\n50 Questions and Answers\non the Science of Color\".\nI did not write this book, I wish I had,\nthe book is by Arielle and Joann Eckstut,\nthat E-C-K-S-T-U-T.\nSo, it's \"What Is Color?:\n50 Questions and Answers\non the Science of Color\".\nIt's an absolutely fabulous book,\nI've no business relationship to them.\nI did help them get in contact\nwith some color vision scientists\nwhen they reached out to me.\nAnd you can know that all\nthe information in the book\nwas vetted by excellent\ncolor vision scientists.\nIt's a really wonderful\nand beautiful book,\nthe illustrations are beautiful.\nIf you're somebody who's\ninterested in design or art,\nor you're just curious\nabout the science of color,\nit's a terrific book,\nI highly recommend it.\nIf you just look it up online,\nthere are a variety of places\nthat will allow you to access the book.\nSo, let's talk about sensing chemicals\nand how chemicals control us.\nIn our environment,\nthere are a lot of\ndifferent physical stimuli.\nThere is light,\nphotons, which are light energy\nand those land on your retinas\nand your retinas tell\nyour brain about them,\nand your brain creates\nthis thing we call vision.\nThere are sound waves,\nliterally particles moving through the air\nand reverberations that create\nwhat we call sound and hearing.\nAnd of course there\nare mechanical stimuli,\npressure, light touch, scratch,\ntickle, et cetera, that lands on our skin\nor the blowing of a breeze\nthat deflects the hairs on our skin,\nand we can sense mechanical\ntouch, mechanical sensation.\nAnd there are chemicals,\nthere are things floating\naround in the environment\nwhich we call volatile chemicals.\nSo, volatile sounds oftentimes\nlike emotionally volatile,\nbut it just means that they're\nfloating around out there.\nSo, when you actually smell something\nlike let's say you smell\na wonderfully smelling rose or cake.\nYes, you are inhaling the\nparticles into your nose,\nthey're literally little particles\nof those chemicals are\ngoing up into your nose\nand being detected by your brain.\nAlso, if you smell something putrid,\ndisgusting, or awful,\nuse your imagination,\nthose particles are\ngoing up into your nose\nand being detected by neurons\nthat are part of your brain.\nOther ways of getting\nchemicals into our system\nis by putting them in our mouth,\nby literally taking\nfoods and chewing them,\nor sucking on them and breaking them down\ninto their component parts,\nand that's one way that we sense chemicals\nwith this thing, our tongue.\nAnd there are chemicals that can enter\nthrough other mucosal linings\nand other kind of just think damp,\nsticky linings of your body.\nAnd the main ones would be the eyes,\nso you've got your nose,\nyour eyes and your mouth.\nBut mainly when we have\nchemicals coming into our system\nit's through our nose\nor through our mouth.\nAlthough, sometimes through our skin\ncertain things can go\ntransdermal, not many,\nand through our eyes.\nSo these chemicals,\nwe sometimes bring into\nour body, into our biology,\nthrough deliberate action.\nWe select a food, we chew that food,\nand we do it intentionally.\nSometimes they're coming into our body\nthrough non-deliberate action.\nWe enter an environment,\nand there's smoke and we smell the smoke,\nand as a consequence we take action.\nSometimes we are forced to eat something\nbecause somebody tells us we should eat it\nor we do it to be polite.\nSo, there are all these ways\nthat chemicals can make it into our body.\nSometimes however, other people\nare actively making\nchemicals with their body,\ntypically this would be with their breath,\nwith their tears,\nor possibly, I want to\nunderscore possibly,\nby making what are called pheromones,\nmolecules that they release\ninto the environment\ntypically through the breath\nthat enter our system through our nose,\nor our eyes, or our mouth\nthat fundamentally change our biology.\nI will explain how smell and taste\nand these pheromone effects work,\nbut I'll just give an example,\nwhich is a very salient\nand interesting one\nthat was published about 10 years ago\nin the Journal Science.\nScience Magazine is one of the three\nwhat we call apex journals.\nThere are a lot of journals out there,\nbut for those of you that want to know,\nScience Magazine, Nature\nMagazine, and Cell\nare considered the three\ntop kind of apex journals,\nthey are the most stringent\nin terms of getting papers accepted,\nthey're even reviewed there.\nThey have about a 95% rejection\nrate at the front gate,\nmeaning they don't even review 95%\nof what gets sent to them.\nOf the things that they\ndo decide to review\nthen get sent out,\na very small percentage\nof those get published,\nit's very stringent.\nThis paper came out in Science\nshowing that humans, men in\nparticular in this study,\nhave a strong biological\nresponse and hormonal response\nto the tears of women.\nWhat they did is they had women,\nand in this case it was only\nwomen for whatever reason,\ncry and they collected their tears.\nThen those tears were\nsmelled by male subjects,\nor male subjects got what\nwas essentially the control,\nwhich was the saline.\nMen that smelled these tears\nthat were evoked by sadness\nhad a reduction in their\ntestosterone levels\nthat was significant.\nThey also had a reduction in brain areas\nthat were associated with sexual arousal.\nNow, before you run off\nwith your interpretations\nabout what this means\nand criticize the study\nfor any variety of reasons,\nlet's just take a step back.\nI will criticize the study\nfor a variety of reasons too.\nOne is that they only used\nfemale tiers and male subjects,\nso it would have been nice for\nthem to also use female tears\nand female subjects smelling those,\nmale tears and male\nsubjects smelling those,\nmale tears and female subjects\nsmelling those, and so on.\nThey didn't do that,\nthey did have a large number of subjects,\nso that's good, that\nadds power to the study.\nAnd they did have to collect these tears\nby having the women watch\nwhat was essentially\na sad scene from a movie.\nThey actually recruited subjects\nthat had a high propensity\nfor crying at sad movies,\nwhich was not all women.\nIt turns out that the\npeople that they recruited\nfor the study were people who said, \"Yes,\nI tend to cry when I see\nsad things in movies.\"\nWhat they're really trying to do\nis get just get tears that\nwere authentically cried\nin response to sadness,\nas opposed to putting\nsome irritant in the eye\nand collecting tears that\nwere evoked by something else\nlike just having the eyes irritated.\nNonetheless, what this study illustrates\nis that there are chemicals in tears\nthat are evoking or changing the biology\nof other individuals.\nNow, most of us don't think about sniffing\nor smelling other people's tears,\nbut you can imagine how in close couples,\nor in family members,\nor even close friendships, et cetera,\nthat we are often in close proximity\nto other people's tears.\nNow, I didn't select\nthis study as an example\nbecause I want to focus on the effects\nof tears on hormones, per se,\nalthough I do find the\nresults really interesting.\nI chose it because I\nwanted to just emphasize\nor underscore the fact\nthat chemicals that are\nmade by other individuals\nare powerfully modulating\nour internal state,\nand that's something that\nmost of us don't appreciate.\nI think most of us can appreciate the fact\nthat if we smell something\nputrid, we tend to retract,\nor if we smell something\ndelicious, we tend to lean into it.\nBut there are all these\nways in which chemicals\nare affecting our biology,\nand interpersonal\ncommunication using chemicals\nis not something that we\nhear that often about,\nbut it's super interesting.\nSo, let's talk about smell\nand what smell is and how it works.\nI'm going to make this very basic,\nbut I am going to touch on\nsome of the core elements\nof the neurobiology.\nSo, here's how smell works.\nSmell starts with sniffing.\nNow, that may come as no surprise,\nbut no volatile chemicals\ncan enter our nose\nunless we inhale them.\nIf our nose is occluded, or\nif we're actively exhaling\nit's much more difficult for\nsmells to enter our nose,\nwhich is why people cover their nose\nwhen something smells bad.\nNow, the way that these volatile odors\ncome into the nose is interesting.\nThe nose has a mucosal lining,\nmucus that is designed to trap things,\nto actually bring things\nin and get stuck there.\nAt the base of your brain,\nso you could actually imagine this\nor if you wanted, you could\ntouch the roof of your mouth.\nSo, right above the roof of the mouth,\nabout two centimeters\nis your olfactory bulb.\nThe olfactory bulb is\na collection of neurons\nand those neurons actually\nextend out of the skull,\nout of your skull into your nose\ninto the mucosal lining.\nSo, what this means in\nkind of a literal sense\nis that you have neurons that extend\ntheir little dendrites\nand axon-like things,\nthey're little processes as we call them,\nout into the mucus,\nand they respond to\ndifferent odorant compounds.\nNow, the olfactory neurons\nalso send a branch deeper into the brain\nand they split off into\nthree different paths.\nSo, one path is for what we\ncall innate odor responses,\nso you have some hard wired aspects\nto the way that you smell the world\nthat were there from the day you were born\nand that will be there\nuntil the day you die.\nThese are the pathways and\nthe neurons that respond\nto things like smoke,\nwhich as you can imagine there's\na highly adaptive function\nto being able to detect burning things\nbecause burning things\ngenerally means lack of safety\nor impending threat of some kind.\nIt calls for action,\nand indeed these neurons project\nto the central area of the\nbrain called the amygdala,\nwhich is often discussed in terms of fear,\nbut it's really fear and threat detection.\nSo some compounds, some\nchemicals in your environment\nwhen you smell them, unless\nyou're trained to overcome them\nbecause you're a firefighter\nyou will naturally have a\nheightened level of alertness,\nyou will sense threat,\nand if you're in sleep,\neven it will wake you up.\nAll right, so that's a good thing,\nit's kind of an emergency system.\nYou also have neurons in your nose\nthat respond to odorants\nor combinations of odorants\nthat evoke a sense of desire\nand what we call appetitive\nbehaviors, approach behaviors,\nthat make you want to\nmove toward something.\nSo, when you smell a delicious cookie,\nor some dish that's really\nsavory that you really like,\nor a wonderful orange,\nand you say, \"Mmm,\"\nor it feels delicious,\nor it smells delicious\nthat's because of these innate pathway,\nthese pathways that require\nno learning whatsoever.\nNow, some of the pathways from the nose,\nthese olfactory neurons into the brain\nare involved in learned\nassociations with odors.\nMany people have this experience\nthat they can remember the smell\nof their grandmother's home,\nor their grandmother's hands even,\nor the smell of particular items baking,\nor on the stove in a\nparticular environment.\nTypically, these memories tend\nto be of a kind of nurturing\nsort of feeling safe and protected.\nBut one of the reasons why olfaction smell\nis so closely tied to memory\nis because olfaction is the\nmost ancient sense that we have,\nor I should say chemical sensing\nis among the most primitive\nand ancient senses that we have,\nprobably almost certainly evolved\nbefore vision and before hearing.\nBut when we come into the world\nbecause we're still learning\nabout the statistics of life\nabout who's friendly\nand who's not friendly,\nand where's a fun place to be\nand where's a boring place to be,\nthat all takes a long time to learn.\nBut the olfactory system seems to imprint,\nseems to lay down memories very early\nand create these very\npowerful associations.\nAnd if you think about it\nlong enough and hard enough\nmany of you can probably realize\nthat there are certain\nsmells that evoke a memory\nof a particular place,\nor person, or context.\nAnd that's because you also\nhave pathways out of the nose\nthat are not for innate\nbehaviors like cringing,\nor repulsion, or gagging,\nor for that appetitive mmm sensation,\nbut that just remind you of a place,\nor a thing, or a context,\ncould be flowers in spring,\ncould be grandmother's home and cookies.\nThis is a very common occurrence,\nand it's a very common occurrence\nbecause this generally\nexists in all of us.\nSo, we have pathway for innate responses\nand a pathway for learned responses.\nAnd then we have this other pathway,\nand in humans it's a\nlittle bit controversial\nas to whether or not\nit sits truly separate\nfrom the standard olfactory system\nor whether or not it's its\nown system embedded in there,\nbut that they call the\naccessory olfactory pathway.\nAccessory olfactory pathway\nis what in other animals\nis responsible for true pheromone effects.\nWe will talk about true pheromone effects,\nbut for example in rodents\nand in some primates, including mandrills.\nIf you've ever seen a mandrill,\nthey have these like\nbig beak noses things,\nyou may have seen them at the zoo,\nlook them up if you\nhaven't seen them already,\nM-A-N-D-R-I-L-S\nmandrills, there are\nstrong pheromone effects.\nSome of those include things like\nif you take a pregnant\nfemale rodent or mandrill,\nyou take away the father\nthat created those\nfetuses or fetus,\nand you introduce the scent of the urine\nor the fur of a novel male,\nshe will spontaneously abort\nor miscarry those fetuses,\nit's a very powerful effect.\nIn humans, it's still controversial\nwhether or not anything\nlike that can happen,\nbut it's a very powerful\npheromonal effect in other animals.\nAnother example of a pheromone effect\nis called the Vandenbergh effect\nnamed after the person who\ndiscovered this effect,\nwhere you take a female\nof a given species that\nhas not entered puberty,\nyou expose her to the scent or the urine\nfrom a sexually competent,\nmeaning post-pubertal male,\nand she spontaneously\ngoes into puberty earlier.\nSo, something about the scent\ntriggers something through this\naccessory olfactory system,\nthis is a true pheromonal effect\nand creates ovulation,\nright and menstruation.\nOr in rodents it's an estrous\ncycle, not a menstrual cycle.\nSo, this is not to say\nthat the exact same things\nhappen in humans.\nIn humans, as I mentioned earlier,\nthere are chemical sensing\nbetween individuals\nthat may be independent of the nose.\nAnd we will talk about those,\nbut those are basically the three paths\nby which smells, odors impact us.\nSo, I want to talk about\nthe act of smelling,\nand if you are not somebody who\nis very interested in smell,\nbut you are somebody who is interested\nin making your brain work better,\nlearning faster, remembering more things,\nthis next little segment is for you\nbecause it turns out that how you smell,\nmeaning the act of smelling,\nnot how good or bad you smell,\nbut the act of smelling,\nsniffing, and inhalation\npowerfully impacts\nhow your brain functions\nand what you can learn\nand what you can't learn.\nBreathing generally\nconsists of two actions,\ninhaling and exhaling,\nand we have the option of course\nto do that through our nose or our mouth.\nI've talked on previous\nepisodes about the fact\nthat there are great advantages\nto being a nasal breather,\nand there are a great disadvantages\nto being a mouth breather.\nThere are excellent\nbooks and data on this,\nthere's the recent book\n\"Breath\" by James Nestor,\nwhich is an excellent book\nthat describes some of\nthe positive effects\nof nasal breathing as well\nas other breathing practices.\nThere's also the book\n\"Jaws\" by my colleagues,\nPaul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,\nwith a foreword by Jared Diamond\nand an introduction by Robert\nSapolsky from Stanford.\nSo, that's a book chockablock\nwith heavy hitter authors that describes\nhow being a nasal breather is\nbeneficial for jaw structure,\nfor immune system function, et cetera\nBreathing in through your nose,\nsniffing actually has positive effects\non the way that you can acquire\nand remember information.\nNoam Sobel's group\noriginally at UC Berkeley\nand then at the Weizmann Institute\nhas published a number of papers\nthat I'd like to discuss today.\nOne of them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition\nPhase-Locked with Inhalation,\nthis was published in\nNature Human Behavior,\nan excellent journal.\nShowed that the act of inhaling\n[Andrew inhales deeply]\nhas a couple of interesting\nand powerful consequences.\nFirst of all, as we inhale\nthe brain increases in arousal,\nour level of alertness\nand attention increases\nwhen we inhale as compared\nto when we exhale.\nNow, of course with every\ninhale, there's an exhale,\nyou could probably\ndouble up on your inhales\nif you're doing size or something,\nphysiological size I've\ntalked about these before,\nso double inhales [inhales twice]\nfollowed by an exhale [exhales],\nsomething like that.\nOr if you're speaking, you're\ngoing to change your cadence\nand ratio of inhales and exhales,\nbut typically we inhale, then we exhale.\nAs we inhale, what this paper shows\nis that the level of alertness\ngoes up in the brain,\nand this makes sense because\nas the most primitive\nand primordial sense by which we interact\nwith our environment and bring\nchemicals into our system\nand detect our environment,\ninhaling is a cue for\nthe rest of the brain\nto essentially to pay\nattention to what's happening,\nnot just to the odors\nas the name of this paper suggests,\nHuman Non-Olfactory Cognition\nPhase-Locked with Inhalation.\nWhat that means is that\nthe act of inhaling itself\nwakes up the brain,\nit's not about what you're perceiving\nor what you're smelling.\nAnd indeed sniffing as an action,\ninhaling as an action\nhas a powerful effect\non your ability to be alert,\nyour ability to attend, to focus,\nand your ability to remember information.\nWhen we exhale, the brain\ngoes through a subtle,\nbut nonetheless significant dip\nin level of arousal and ability to learn.\nSo, what does this mean?\nHow should you use this knowledge?\nWell, you could imagine,\nand I think this will be\nbeneficial for most people\nto focus on nasal breathing\nwhile doing any kind of focused\nwork that doesn't require\nthat you speak, or eat,\nor ingest something.\nThere's a separate paper published\nin the journal of neuroscience that showed\nthat indeed if subjects, human subjects,\nare restricted to breathing\nthrough their nose,\nthey learn better than\nif they have the option\nof breathing through their mouth,\nor a combination of their nose and mouth.\nThese are significant effects\nin humans using modern\ntechniques from excellent groups.\nSo, sniffing itself is\na powerful modulator\nof our cognition and our ability to learn.\nYou can imagine all sorts of ways\nthat you might apply that as a tool.\nAnd I suggest that you play with it a bit\nthat if you're having a hard\ntime staying awake and alert,\nyou're having a hard time\nremembering information,\nyou feel like you have a\nkind of attention deficit,\nnonclinical of course,\nnasal breathing ought to help,\nextending or making your inhales\nmore intense ought to help.\nNow, this isn't really about\nchemical sensing per se,\nbut here's where it gets\ninteresting and exciting.\nIf you are somebody\nwho doesn't have a very\ngood sense of smell,\nor you're somebody who\nsimply wants to get better\nat smelling and tasting things,\nyou can actually practice sniffing.\nI know that sounds ridiculous,\nbut it turns out that\nsimply sniffing nothing.\nSo, doing something like this.\n[Andrew sniffs deeply]\nI guess the microphone sort\nof has a smell [sniffs],\nI guess my pen doesn't have a smell.\n[Andrew sniffs deeply]\nIt turns out that doing\na series of inhales,\nand of course each one\nis followed by an exhale,\n10 or 15 times and then smelling an object\nlike an orange or another item of food,\nor even the skin of somebody else\nwill lead to an increase in your ability\nto perceive those odors.\nNow, there are probably\ntwo reasons for that.\nOne reason is that the brain systems\nof detecting things are waking up\nas a mere consequence of inhaling.\nOkay, so this is sort of\nthe olfactory equivalent\nof opening your eyes wider in\norder to see, more or less.\nOkay, last episode I talked about\nhow opening your eyes wider\nactually increases your\nlevel of alertness,\nit's not just that your level of alertness\ncauses your eyes to be open wider.\nOpening your eyes wider\ncan actually increase\nyour level of alertness.\nWell, it turns out that\nbreathing more deeply\nthrough the nose, wakes up your brain\nand it creates a heightened sensitivity\nof the neurons that relate to smell.\nAnd there's a close crossover,\nI'm sure you know this,\nbetween smell and taste.\nIf any of you have ever had a cold\nor you have for whatever reason\nyou've lost your sense of smell,\nyou become what they call anosmic,\nyour sense of taste suffers also.\nWe'll talk a little bit more\nabout why that is in a few minutes,\nbut as a first protocol,\nI'd really like all of you to consider\nbecoming nasal breathers\nwhile you're trying to learn,\nwhile you're trying to listen,\nwhile you're trying to wake\nup your brain in any way\nand learn and retain information,\nthis is a powerful tool.\nNow, there are other ways\nto wake up your brain more as well.\nFor instance, the use of smelling salts.\nI'm not recommending that\nyou do this necessarily,\nbut there are excellent peer reviewed data\nshowing that indeed, if\nyou use smelling salts,\nwhich are mostly of the\nsort that include ammonia,\nammonia is a very toxic scent,\nbut it's toxic in a way that\ntriggers this innate pathway,\nthe pathway from the nose to the amygdala,\nand wakes up the brain\nand body in a major way.\nThis is why they use smelling salts\nwhen people pass out,\nthis is why fighters used to use\nor maybe sometimes\nstill use smelling salts\nin order to heighten\ntheir level of alertness,\nthis is why powerlifters\nwill inhale smelling salts.\nThey work because they trigger the fear\nand kind of overall arousal\nsystems of the brain,\nthis is why I think most\npeople probably shouldn't\nuse ammonia or smelling\nsalts to try and wake up,\nbut they really do work.\nIf you've ever smelled smelling salts\nand I have, I tried this,\nthey give you a serious jolt,\nit's like six espresso\ninfused into your bloodstream all at once,\nyou are wide awake immediately\nand you feel a heightened\nsense of kind of desire to move\nbecause you release\nadrenaline into your body.\nNow, inhaling through your nose\nand doing nasal breathing\nis not going to do that,\nit's going to be a more subtle\nversion of waking up your system\nof alerting your brain overall.\nAnd for those of you that are\ninterested in having a richer,\na more deep connection\nto the things that you smell and taste,\nincluding other individuals\nperhaps not just food,\npracticing or enhancing\nyour sense of sniffing,\nyour ability to sniff\nmight sound like a kind\nof ridiculous protocol,\nbut it's actually a kind\nof fun and cool experiment\nthat you can do.\nYou just do the simple\nexperiment of taking for instance\nan orange, you smell it,\ntry and gauge your level of perception\nof how orange-ish it smells,\nor lemony, lemonish, lemony, I don't know\nis it lemonish or lemony?\nLemony it smells, then set it away,\ndo 10 or 15 inhales\n[Andrew inhales and exhales]\nfollowed by exhales of course,\nor just through the nose.\n[Andrew breaths rapidly]\nI'm not going to do all 10 or 15.\nAnd then smell it again,\nand you'll notice that your\nperception of that smell,\nthe kind of richness of that smell\nwill be significantly increased.\nAnd that's again, for two reasons,\none, the brain is in a position\nto respond to it better,\nyour brain has been aroused\nby the mere act of sniffing,\nbut also the neurons that respond\nto that lemon odor, that lemony or odor\nare going to respond better.\nSo, you can actually have\na heightened experience\nof something, and that of\ncourse will also be true\nfor the taste system.\nYou also can really\ntrain your sense of smell\nto get much, much better.\nWhen Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley\nI happened to be a graduate\nstudent around that time,\nand every once in a while I'd look outside\nand there would be people\ncrawling around on the grass\nwith goggles on, gloves on,\nand these hoods on with earmuffs.\nAnd they looked ridiculous,\nbut what they were doing\nis they were actually\nlearning to follow scent trails.\nSo, in the world of dogs\nyou have sight hounds that use their eyes\nin order to navigate and find things,\nand you have scent towns\nthat use their nose.\nAnd the scent hounds are remarkable,\nthey can be trained to detect a scent.\nThese are the sniffing,\nyou know, the bomb sniffing\nand the drug sniffing dogs in airports.\nThere are now dogs actually that can sniff\nout COVID infections with a\nvery high degree of accuracy,\nthey can be trained to do that.\nThere's something about the COVID\nand similar infections\nthat the body produces\nprobably in the immune response,\nsome odors and the dogs\nare I think as high as 90%\nin some cases, maybe even 95% accuracy,\njust remarkable.\nThere are theories that\ndogs can sniff out cancer,\nthis stuff all exceeds\nstatistical significance.\nIt's still a little bit\nmysterious in some ways,\nbut you may not ever achieve\nthe olfactory capabilities\nof a scent hound,\nbut what Noam Sobel's lab\ndid is they had people\ncompletely eliminate\ntheir visual experience\nby having them wear\ndark glasses or goggles,\nso they couldn't see,\nand they couldn't hear,\nthey couldn't sense anything\nwith their sense of touch,\nthey had thick gloves on.\nBut they had these masks on\nwhere just their nasal passages were open\nand people could in a\nfairly short amount of time\nlearn to follow a chocolate\nscent trail on the ground,\nwhich is not something that\nmost people want to do,\nbut what they showed using\nbrain imaging, et cetera\nin subsequent studies\nis that the human brain,\nyou can learn to really\nenhance your sense of smell\nand become very astute in distinguishing\nwhether or not one particular odor\nor combinations of odors\nis such that it's less than,\nor more than a different\nodor for instance.\nNow, why would you want to do this?\nWell, if you like to eat as much as I do,\none of the things\nthat can really enhance\nyour sense of pleasure\nfrom the experience of ingesting food\nis to enhance your sense of smell.\nAnd if you don't have\na great sense of smell,\nor if you have a sense of smell\nthat's really so good that it's\nalways picking up bad odors,\nwe'll talk about that in a minute.\nWell, then you might want to\ntune up your sense of smell\nby doing this practice\nof 10 or 15 breaths,\nexcuse me, sniffs, not breaths,\nsniffs and then interacting\nwith some food item\nor thing that you're\ninterested in smelling more of.\nSo, these could be the ingredients\nthat you're cooking with,\nI really encourage you to\ntry and really smell them.\nYou sometimes hear this\nas kind of a mindfulness practice\nlike ooh, really smell the\nfood, really taste the food.\nAnd we always hear about that\nas kind of a mindfulness\nand presence thing,\nbut you actually can\nincrease the sensitivity\nof your olfactory and your\ntaste system by doing this.\nAnd it has long-term effects,\nthat's what's so interesting.\nThis isn't the kind of thing\nthat you have to do every time you eat.\nYou don't have to be the\nweirdo in the restaurant\nthat's like picking up the radish\nand like jamming it up your\nnostrils, please don't do that.\nYou don't have to\nnecessarily smell everything,\nalthough it's nice\nsometimes to smell the food\nthat you're about to\neat and as you eat it,\nbut it has long-term effects\nin terms of your ability to distinguish\nand discriminate different types of odors.\nAnd these don't even have\nto be very pungent foods\nit turns out,\nthe studies show that doesn't have\nto be some really stinky cheese,\nyou know, there are cheese shops\nthat I've walked into where\nlike I just basically gag,\nI can't handle it, I\njust can't be in there,\nit just overwhelms me.\nOther people, they love that smell.\nSo, you have to tune it to\nyour interest and experience,\nbut I think even for\nyou fasters out there,\neverybody eats at some point,\neverybody ingests chemicals\nthrough their mouth.\nAnd one of the ways that\nyou can powerfully increase\nyour relationship to that experience\nand make it much more positive\nis through just the occasional practice\nof 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing,\nwhich almost sounds ridiculous\nlike how could that be?\nBut now, you understand why,\nit's because of the way that\nthe sniffing action increases\nthe alertness of the brain\nas well as increasing the\nsensitivity of the system.\nNo other system that\nI'm aware of in our body\nis as amenable to these kinds\nof behavioral training shifts\nand allow them to happen so quickly.\nI would love to be able to tell you\nthat just doing 10 or 15\nnear-far exercises with a pen\nor going outside for 10\nor 15 seconds each morning\nis going to completely change\nthe way that you see the world.\nBut it actually isn't the case,\nyou actually, it requires more training,\na little bit more effort\nin the visual system.\nIn the olfactory system,\nand your smell system,\nand in your taste system\njust the tiniest bit of\ntraining and attention,\nand sniffing, inhaling\ncan radically change\nyour relationship to food\nsuch that you actually\nstart to feel very different\nas a consequence of ingesting those foods\nas well as becoming more\ndiscerning about which foods\nyou like and which ones you don't like.\nAnd we're going to talk about that\nbecause there's a really wonderful thing\nthat happens when you start\ndeveloping a sensitive palate\nand a sensitive sense of smell\nin a way that allows\nyou to guide your eating\nand smelling decisions,\nand maybe even interpersonal decisions\nabout who you spend time with,\nor mate with, or whatever,\nin a way that is really\nin line with your biology.\nIn fact, how well we can\nsmell and taste things\nis actually a very strong\nindication of our brain health.\nNow, that's not to say\nthat if you have a poor sense of smell\nor a poor sense of taste, that\nyou're somehow brain damaged\nor you're going to have dementia,\nalthough sometimes early signs of dementia\nor loss of neurons in\nother regions of the brain\nrelated to say Parkinson's\ncan show up first\nas a loss of sense of smell.\nAgain, it's not causal,\nand it's certainly not\nthe case that every time\nyou have a sudden loss of smell\nthat there's necessarily brain damage,\nI want to be very about that,\nbut they are often correlated.\nThere's also a lot of interest right now\nin loss of sense of smell\nbecause one of the early\ndetection signs of COVID-19\nwas a loss of sense of smell.\nSo, I just briefly want to talk\nabout loss of sense of smell\nand regaining sense of smell and taste\nbecause these have powerful\nimplications for overall health.\nAnd in fact can indicate\nsomething about brain damage\nand can even inform how\nquickly we might be recovering\nfrom something like a concussion.\nSo, our olfactory neurons,\nthese neurons in our\nnose that detect odors\nare really unique among\nother brain neurons\nbecause they get\nreplenished throughout life,\nthey don't just regenerate,\nbut they get replenished.\nSo regeneration is when something\nis damaged and it regrows,\nthese neurons are constantly turning\nover throughout our lifespan,\nthey're constantly being replenished,\nthey're dying off and they're\nbeing replaced by new ones.\nThis is an amazing aspect of our brain\nthat's basically unique to these neurons,\nthere's one other region of the brain\nwhere there's a little bit of this maybe,\nbut these olfactory neurons\nabout every three or four weeks they die.\nAnd when they die, they're replaced\nby new ones that come from a\ndifferent region of the brain,\na region called the subventricular zone.\nThe name isn't as important,\nbut as the phenomenon,\nbut these neurons are\nborn in the ventricle,\nthe area of your brain that's\na hole that contains...\nIt's not an empty hole,\nit's a hole basically that\ncontains cerebral spinal fluid.\nWell, there's a little\nsubventricular zone,\nthere's a little zone\nbelow, sub ventricles.\nAnd that zone, if you\nare exercising regularly,\nif your dopamine levels are high enough,\nthose little cells there\nare like stem cells.\nThey are stem cells and they spit out\nwhat are called little neuroblasts,\nthose little neuroblasts migrate\ninto the front of your\nbrain and then shimmy,\nthey kind of move through\nwhat's called the\nrostral migratory stream.\nThey kind of shimmy along\nand land back in your olfactory bulb,\nsettle down and extend little wires\ninto your olfactory mucosa.\nThis is an ongoing process\nof what we call neurogenesis\nor the birth of new neurons.\nNow, this is really interesting\nbecause other neurons in\nyour cortex, in your retina,\nin your cerebellum, they do not do this,\nthey are not continually\nreplenished throughout life.\nBut these neurons, these\nolfactory neurons are,\nthey are special.\nAnd there are a number of things\nthat seem to increase the amount\nof olfactory neuron neurogenesis.\nThere is evidence that\nexercise, blood flow,\ncan increase olfactory\nneuron neurogenesis.\nAlthough, those data are fewer\nin comparison to things\nlike social interactions,\nor actually interacting with\nodorants of different kinds.\nSo, if you're somebody who\ndoesn't smell things well,\nyou have a poor sense of smell,\nyour olfactory system\ndoesn't seem very sensitive,\nmore sniffing, more smelling\nis going to be good.\nAnd then the molecule\ndopamine, this neuromodulator,\nthat is associated with\nmotivation and drive.\nAnd in some cases, if it's\nvery, very high with mania,\nor if it's very, very low with\ndepression or Parkinson's,\nbut for most people where dopamine\nis in essentially normal ranges\ndopamine is also a powerful\ntrigger of the establishment\nof these new neurons and their migration\ninto the olfactory bulb\nand your ability to smell.\nNow, you don't want to confuse\ncorrelation with causation,\nso if you're not good at smelling\ndoes that mean you have low dopamine?\nNo, not necessarily.\nIf you have low dopamine,\ndoes that mean that you\nhave a poor sense of smell?\nNo, not necessarily.\nSome people who take\nantidepressants of the sort\nthat impact the dopamine\nsystem strongly like Wellbutrin\nwill report a sudden, meaning\nwithin a couple of days,\nincrease in their ability\nto smell particular odors,\nand it's a very striking effect.\nSome people when they\nare in a new relationship\nbecause dopamine and the hormones,\ntestosterone and estrogen\nare associated with novelty\nand the sorts of behaviors\nthat often are associated\nwith new relationships\nthose three molecules;\ndopamine, testosterone, and\nestrogen kind of work together.\nAnd oftentimes people will say\nor report when they're newly in love\nor in a new relationship that\nthey're just obsessed with,\nor they just so enjoy the\nscent of another person\nso much so that they like to borrow\nthe other person's clothing\nor they'll sniff the\nother person's clothing\nor they can even just in\nthe absence of the person\nthey can imagine their smell\nand feel a biological response,\nsomething that we'll talk more about.\nSo, these neurons turnover\nthroughout the lifespan\nand as we age, we actually\ncan lose our sense of smell.\nAnd it's likely, I want\nto underscore likely,\nthat that loss of sense of smell as we age\nis correlated with a loss of other neurons\nin the retina, in the\nears, a loss of vision,\nloss of hearing, loss of smell,\nloss of the sense apparati\nwhich our neurons is\ncorrelated with aging.\nSo, what we've been talking about today\nis the ability to sense these odors,\nbut what I'd like to do\nis empower you with tools\nthat will allow you to keep\nthese systems tuned up.\nLast time, we talked about tuning up\nand keeping your visual\nsystem tuned up and healthy\nregardless of age.\nHere, we're talking about really enhancing\nyour olfactory abilities,\nyour taste abilities as well\nby interacting a lot with odors,\npreferably positive odors,\nand sniffing more, inhaling more,\nwhich almost sounds crazy,\nbut now you understand why.\nEven though it might sound crazy\nit's grounded in real mechanistic biology\nof how the brain wakes up and\nresponds to these chemicals.\nNow, speaking of brain injury,\nolfactory dysfunction is a common theme\nin traumatic brain injury\nfor the following reason,\nthese olfactory neurons as I mention\nextend wires into the mucosa of the nose,\nbut they also extend a\nwire up into the skull.\nAnd they extend up into the skull\nthrough what's called\nthe cribriform plate,\nit's like a Swiss cheese type plate\nwhere they're going through.\nAnd if you get a head hit,\nthat bone, the cribriform plate,\nsheers those little wires off\nand those neurons die.\nNow, eventually they'll be replaced,\nbut there's a phenomenon\nby which concussion\nand the severity of concussion\nand the recovery from a head injury\ncan actually be gauged in part,\nin part, not in whole,\nbut in part by how well\nor fully one recovers\ntheir sense of smell.\nSo, if you're somebody that unfortunately\nhas suffered a concussion,\nyour sense of smell is one readout\nby which you might evaluate\nwhether or not you're regaining\nsome of your sensory performance.\nOf course, there will be others\nlike balance, and cognition,\nand sleep, et cetera.\nBut I'd like to refer you\nto a really nice paper\nwhich is entitled Olfactory Dysfunction\nin Traumatic Brain Injury:\nthe Role of Neurogenesis\nthe first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N.\nThe paper was published\nin Current Allergy and\nAsthma Report, this is 2020.\nI spent some time with this\npaper, it's quite good,\nit's a review article,\nI like reviews if they're\npeer-reviewed reviews\nand in quality journals.\nAnd what they discuss\nis and I'll just read here briefly\n'cause they said it better than I could,\n\"Olfactory functioning\ndisturbances are common\nfollowing traumatic brain injury, TBI,\nand can have a significant\nimpact on the quality of life.\nAlthough there is no standard\ntreatment for patients\nwith the loss of smell.\"\nNow I'm paraphrasing,\n\"Post-injury olfactory training\nhas shown promise for beneficial effects.\nSome of this involves,\"\nthey go on to tell us\nthe role of dopamine,\ndopaminergic signaling,\nas I mentioned before,\nbut what does this mean?\nThis means that if\nyou've had a head injury\nor repeated head injuries that\nenhancing your sense of smell\nis one way by which you\ncan create new neurons.\nAnd now, you know how to\nenhance your sense of smell\nby interacting with things\nthat have an odor very closely,\nand by essentially inhaling more,\nfocusing on the inhale\nto wake up the brain\nand to really focus on some\nof the nuance of those smells.\nSo, you might do for instance a smell test\nby which you smell something like a lemon,\nput it down, do 10 inhales or so,\nsmell again, et cetera.\nYou might also just\ntake a more active role\nin trying to taste and smell your food,\nand taste and smell various things.\nI mean, please don't ingest anything\nthat's poisonous that you're\nnot supposed to be ingesting,\nbut you know what I mean,\nreally tuning up this system,\nI think is an excellent review,\nwe're going to do an entire episode\nall about the use of the\nvisual system in particular,\nbut also the olfactory\nsystem for treatment\nof traumatic brain injury,\nas well as other methods.\nBut I wanted to just mention it here\nbecause a number of\npeople asked me about TBI.\nAnd here again, we're in\nthis place where the senses\nand our ability to sense these chemicals\nthrough these two holes\nin the front of our face,\nour nostrils is a powerful readout\nand way to control brain function\nand nervous system function generally.\nJust a quick note about\nthe use of smelling salts,\nI have a feeling that some of\nyou may be interested in that\nand its application.\nIf you are interested in that,\nI recommend you go to the\nscientific literature first\nrather than straight to some vendor\nor to the what do they call it these days?\nCostello bro science, he says,\nbro science, the bro science.\nYou can go to this\npaper, which is excellent\nand is real science, which\nis Acute Effects of Ammonia\nInhalants on Strength and Power\nPerformance in Trained Men.\nIt's a randomized controlled\ntrial, it was published\nin the Journal of Strength\nand Conditioning Research\nin 2018, and it should\nbe very easy to find.\nI will provide a link to\nthe so-called PubMed ID,\nwhich is a string of numbers,\nand we'll put that in the caption\nif you want to go\nstraight to that article,\ndoes show a significant what they call,\nthis is what the words they\nuse literally in quotes,\n\"psyching up effect through the use\nof these ammonia inhalants\nand a significant\nincrease in maximal force\nin force development in a\nvariety of different movements.\"\nSo, for those of you that are interested\nin ammonia inhalants,\nso-called smelling salts,\nthat might be a good reference.\nThe other thing I wanted to talk about\nwith reference to odors is this myth\nwhich is that we don't actually\nsmell things in our dreams,\nthat we don't have a sense of smell.\nThat's pure fiction, I don't\nknow who came up with that,\nit's very clear that we are capable\nof smelling things in our sleep.\nHowever, when we are in REM sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep,\nwhich is the sleep that predominates\ntoward the second half of the night\nour ability to wake up in\nresponse to odors is diminished.\nIt's not absent, but it's diminished.\nIf smoke comes into the\nroom, we will likely wake up\nif the concentration\nof smoke is high enough\nregardless of the stage of sleep we're in,\nbut in REM sleep we tend to be less likely\nto smell, to sniff.\nAnd that actually was measured\nin a number of studies\nthat sniffing in sleep is possible.\nSo, if you put an odor like a lemon\nunderneath someone's nostrils\nin the early portion of\nthe night, they will smell,\nand they will later...\nThey will sniff, excuse me,\nwhether or not they smell or\nnot, I guess depends on them\nand when they showered last,\nbut they will definitely sniff\nand they will report later,\nespecially if you wake them up\nsoon after that, they had a dream\nor a percept of the scent\nof a lemon for instance.\nLater in the night, it's\nharder for that relationship\nto be established,\nit's likely that because\nof some of the paralysis\nassociated with rapid eye movement sleep,\nwhich is a healthy paralysis,\nso-called sleep atonia,\nyou don't want to act out\nyour dreams in REM sleep\nthat there is a less\nactive tendency to sniff.\nAnd actually this has real\nclinical implications,\nthe ability to sniff\nin response to the introduction of an odor\nis actually one way in\nwhich clinicians assess\nwhether or not somebody's\nbrain is so-called brain dead.\nThat's not a nice term, but brain dead,\nor whether or not they have the capacity\nto recover from things like coma\nand other states of deep unconsciousness,\nor I guess you'd call it subconsciousness.\nSo, what will happen is\nif someone has an injury\nand they're essentially out cold,\nthe production of a sniffing reflex,\nor a sniffing response to say a lemon\nor some other odor\npresented below the nostrils\nis considered a sign that the\nbrain is capable of waking up.\nNow, that's not always the\ncase, but it's one indication.\nSo just like you could\nuse mechano sensation,\nso, a toe pinch for instance,\nyou know, or scraping the\nbottom of somebody's barefoot\nto see if they're conscious,\nor shining light in their eyes,\nthese are all things that you've seen\nin movies and television,\nor maybe if you've seen\nin real life as well.\nWell, odors and chemical\nsensing is another way\nby which you can assess\nwhether or not the brain\nis capable of arousal.\nAnd actually olfactory stimulation\nis one of the more prominent ones\nthat's being used in various clinics.\nAs a last point about\nspecific odors and compounds\nthat can increase arousal and alertness,\nand this was simply through sniffing them\nnot through ingesting them.\nThere are data, believe it\nor not, there are good data\non peppermint and the smell of peppermint,\nminty type sense,\nwhether you like them or\nnot will increase attention,\nand they can create the same\nsort of arousal response\nalthough not as intensely\nor as dramatically as ammonia\nsalts can for instance.\nBy the way, please don't\ngo sniff real ammonia,\nyou could actually damage\nyour olfactory epithelium\nif you do that too close to the ammonia.\nIf you're going to use smelling salts\nbe sure you work with someone\nor you know what you're getting\nand how you're using this.\nYou can damage your olfactory pathway\nin ways that are pretty severe,\nyou can also damage your vision.\nIf you've ever teared up\nbecause you inhaled something\nthat was really noxious,\nthat is not a good thing,\nit doesn't mean you\nnecessarily cause damage,\nbut it means that you have\nirritated the mucosal lining\nand possibly even the\nsurfaces of your eyes,\nso please be very, very careful.\nScents like peppermint,\nlike these ammonia smelling salts,\nthe reason they wake you up\nis because they trigger\nspecific olfactory neurons\nthat communicate with the\nspecific centers of the brain,\nnamely the amygdala and\nassociated neurocircuitry\nand pathways that trigger alertness\nof the same sort that a\ncold shower or an ice bath,\nor a sudden surprise,\nor a stressful text message would evoke.\nRemember, the systems of your\nbody that produce arousal,\nand alertness, and attention,\nand that cue you for\noptimal learning, aka focus.\nThose are very general mechanisms,\nthey involve very basic\nmolecules like adrenaline\nand epinephrin same thing actually,\nadrenaline and epinephrin.\nThe number of stimuli, whether\nit's peppermint or ammonia,\nor a loud blast,\nthe number of stimuli that can evoke\nthat adrenaline response\nand that wake up response\nare near infinite.\nAnd that's the beauty\nof your nervous system,\nit was designed to take any\nvariety of different stimuli\nplaced them into categories,\nand then evoke different categories\nof very general responses.\nNow, you know a lot about olfaction\nand how the sense of smell works,\nhere's another experiment that you can do.\nI'll ask you right now.\nDo you like, hate, or are you indifferent\nto the smell of microwave popcorn?\nSome people, including one\nmember of my podcast staff\nsays it's absolutely disgusting to them,\nthey feel like it's completely nauseating.\nI don't mind it at all,\nin fact, I kind of like it.\nI think the smell of a microwave popcorn\nis kind of pleasant.\nI don't particularly like it,\nbut it's certainly not unpleasant.\nSome people have a gene\nthat makes them sensitive\nto the smell of things\nlike microwave popcorn\nsuch that it smells like vomit.\nI probably don't have that gene\nbecause I find the smell\nof microwaved popcorn pretty pleasant.\nSome people hate the smell of cilantro,\nsome people ingest asparagus,\nand when they urinate they\ncan smell the asparagus\nin a very pungent way,\nother people can't smell it at all.\nThese are variants in genes that encode\nfor what are called olfactory receptors.\nEach olfactory sensory neuron\nexpresses one odorant gene,\none gene that codes for a receptor\nthat responds to a particular odor.\nIf you don't have that gene\nyou will not respond to that odor.\nSo, the reason why some\npeople find the smell\nof microwave popcorn to be\nvery noxious, putrid in fact,\nis because they have a\ngene that allows them\nto smell the kind of\nputrid odor within that.\nOther people who lack that gene\njust simply can't smell it,\nso we are not all the same\nwith respect to our sensory experience.\nWhat one person finds delicious,\nanother person might find disgusting.\nI'll give a good example\nwhich is that I absolutely despise\nGorgonzola and blue cheese,\nabsolutely despise it,\nit smells and tastes\nlike dirty moldy socks to me.\nSome people love it, they crave it,\nactually, some people get\na visceral response to it,\nand we will talk about how certain tastes\ncan actually evoke very\ndeep biological responses,\neven hormonal responses\nwhen we talk about taste in a few minutes.\nBut there are these odors,\nfor instance in popcorn\nit's the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline,\nnot proline but pyrroline,\nthat gives off to some people like me\na toasted smell as the\nsugars in the kernels heat,\nbut the compound is also found\nin things like white\nbread and jasmine rice,\nwhich don't have as pungent an odor,\nbut some people smell that\nand it smells like cat urine.\nNow, there are scents like\nmusky scents and musty scents\nthat are secreted by animals like skunks\nand other animals of the\nso-called Mustelidae family.\nSo, these would be ferrets and\nother animals that can spray\nin response to fear, or if they\njust want to mark a territory\nbecause they want to say that's mine.\nDogs incidentally have scent\nglands that they rub on things,\ncats have them too.\nThis musty odor, some people\nfind actually quite pleasant,\nsome people find it to be very noxious\nand that will depend of course\non the concentration, right?\nI'll never forget the first time\nCostello got sprayed by\na skunk and it was awful.\nI actually don't mind the\nsmell of skunk at a distance,\nit's actually a little bit pleasant,\nI admit it's a little bit pleasant to me.\nI don't think that makes me too weird\nbecause if you ever read the book\n\"All Quiet on the Western\nFront\" about World War I,\nthere's a description in\nthere about the smell of skunk\nat a distance being mildly pleasant,\nso the author of that book probably shared\na similar olfactory profile\nto me, or I to them rather,\nbut some people find even the tiniest bit\nof the smell of skunk or\nmusk to be noxious or awful.\nNow, of course in high\nconcentrations, it's really awful.\nAnd unfortunately, poor Costello,\nhe was like literally\nred-eyed and just snorting,\nand it was awful.\nThere's a joke about\ndogs that says that dogs\neither get skunked one\ntime and never again\nor 50 or a hundred times.\nCostello has been skunked no fewer,\nI'm not making this up,\nhas been skunked no fewer than 103 times.\nAnd that's because if he sees something\nor hears something in the\nbushes, he just goes straight in,\nhe does not learn.\nBut if you like this, that\nmusty scent or musky scent,\nwell that says something about\nthe genes that you express\nin your olfactory neurons,\nit is completely inherited.\nAnd if you don't like that scent,\nif it's really noxious\nor you have this response\nto microwave popcorn,\nwell, that means you have\na different compliment,\na different constellation if you will\nof genes that make up for\nthese olfactory sensory neurons\nand the receptors that they express.\nLet's talk about taste.\nNot whether or not you have\ntaste or you don't have taste,\nthere's no way for me to assess that,\nbut rather how we taste things,\nmeaning how we sense chemicals\nin food and in drink.\nThere are essentially five,\nbut scientists now believe\nthere may be six things\nthat we taste alone or in combination,\nthey are sweet tastes,\nsalty tastes, bitter tastes,\nsour tastes, and umami taste.\nMost of you probably\nheard of umami by now,\nit's U-M-A-M-I.\nUmami is actually the name\nfor a particular receptor\nthat you express on your tongue\nthat detects savory tastes,\nso it's the kind of\nthing in braised meats.\nSometimes people can even\nget the activation of umami\nby tomatoes or tomato sauces.\nWhat are each of these tastes\nand taste receptors responsible for?\nAnd then we'll talk about the sixth,\nmaybe you can guess what it is,\nI don't know if you can guess it now.\nI couldn't guess it,\nbut of the five tastes\neach one has a specific\nutility or function.\nEach one has a particular\ngroup of neurons in your mouth,\nin your tongue, believe it or not,\nthat responds to particular chemicals\nand particular chemical structures.\nIt is a total myth, complete fiction,\nthat different parts of your tongue\nharbor different taste receptors.\nYou know, that high\nschool textbook diagram\nthat you know sweet is\nin one part of the tongue\nand sour is in another,\nand bitters in another, complete fiction,\njust total fiction related\nto very old studies\nthat were performed in a\nvery poorly controlled way,\nno serious biologists\nand certainly no one that works on tastes\nwould contend that that's the way\nthat the taste receptors are organized,\nthey are completely\nintermixed along your tongue.\nIf you have heightened\nor decreased sensitivity\nto one of those five things I mentioned;\nsweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour\nat one location in your tongue,\nit likely reflects the\ndensity of overall receptors\nor something going on in your brain,\nbut not the differential\ndistribution of those receptors.\nSo, the sweet receptors\nare neurons that express\na receptor that respond to sugars,\nin the same way that you\nhave cones, photoreceptors,\nin your eye that respond to short,\nmedium, or long wavelength light,\nmeaning blueish, greenish,\nor reddish light.\nYou have a neuron, or neurons plural,\nin your tongue that respond to sugars.\nAnd then those neurons,\nthey don't say sweet,\nthey don't actually send\nany sugar into the brain,\nthey send what we call a volley,\na barrage of action potentials\nof electrical signals\noff into the brain.\nIt's an amazing system.\nSo, all these receptors in your tongue\nmake up what are called the neurons\nthat give rise to a nerve,\na collection of wires, nerve bundles\nof what's called the gustatory nerve,\nit goes from the tongue\nto the so-called nucleus\nof the solitary tract.\nAnd some of you requested names,\nI usually don't like to\ninclude too many names\nfor sake of clarity,\nbut the gustatory nerve from the tongue\ngoes to the nucleus of the solitary tract\nand then to the thalamus\nand to insular cortex.\nYou don't have to remember\nany of those names\nif you don't want to,\nbut if you want mechanism,\nyou want neural circuits,\nthat's the circuit, gustatory\nnerve from the tongue,\nnucleus of the solitary\ntract in the brainstem,\nthen the thalamus, and\nthen insular cortex.\nAnd it is in insular cortex,\nthis regenerate cortex that we sort out\nand make sense of and\nperceive the various tastes.\nNow, it's amazing because\njust taking a little bit\nof sugar or something sour\nlike a little bit of lemon juice\nand touching it to the tongue\nwithin 100 milliseconds, right?\nJust 100 milliseconds,\nfar less than one second,\nyou can immediately distinguish\nah, that's sour,\nthat sweet, that's bitter, that's umami,\nand that's an assessment\nthat's made by the cortex.\nNow, what to these different\nfive receptors encode for?\nWell, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,\nbut what are they really looking for?\nWhat are they sensing?\nWell, sweet stuff signals the\npresence of energy, of sugars.\nAnd while we're all trying\nor we're told that we\nshould eat less sugar\nfor a variety of reasons,\nthe ability to sense whether or not a food\nhas rapid energy source\nor could give rise to glucose is essential\nso we have sweet receptors.\nThe salty receptors, these\nneurons are trying to sense\nwhether or not there are electrolytes\nin a given food or drink.\nElectrolytes are vitally important\nfor the function of our nervous system,\nand for our entire body,\nsodium is what allows neurons to fire.\nWhat allows them to be\nelectrically active.\nWe also need potassium and magnesium,\nthose are the ions that allow\nthe neurons to be active.\nSo the salty receptors,\nthe reason that they are there\nis to make sure that\nwe are getting enough,\nbut not too much salt,\nwe don't want to ingest\nthings that are far too salty.\nBitter receptors are there\nto make sure we don't ingest\nthings that are poisonous.\nHow do I know this?\nHow can I say that?\nEven though I was definitely not consulted\nat the design phase, how can I say that?\nWell, the bitter receptors\ncreate a what we call labeled line,\na unique trajectory to the neurons\nof the brainstem that control the [gags],\nthe gag reflex.\nIf we taste something very bitter\nit automatically triggers the gag reflex.\nNow, some people like bitter taste,\nI actually liked the\ntaste of bitter coffee,\nchildren generally like sweet tastes\nmore than bitter tastes,\nbut even babies if they\ntaste something bitter,\nthey'll just immediately spit it up,\nit's like the gag reflex.\nPutrid smells will also\nevoke the same neurons,\nso some people are very sensitive,\nthey have a very sensitive\nor low threshold vomit reflex,\nyou're going to and there was\nsomebody in my lab early on.\nAnd we never did this intentionally,\nand we're just laughing\n'cause it was so dramatic.\nHow we would have a discussion,\nsomeone would say something\nabout something kind of gross,\nappropriate for the workplace,\nbut nonetheless gross,\nwe are biologists,\nwould say something and they\nwould say, \"Stop, stop stop,\nI'm going to throw up.\"\nYou know and some people\nhave a very low threshold\nquick gag reflex.\nOther people don't, other people\nhave a very stable stomach,\nthey don't, you know,\nthey rarely, if ever vomit.\nThe umami receptor isn't sensing savory\nbecause the body loves savory,\nit's because savory is a signal\nfor the presence of amino acids.\nAnd we'll talk more about this,\nbut the presence of amino acids\nin our gut and in our digestive system,\nand the presence of\nfatty acids is essential,\nthere is in fact, no essential\ncarbohydrate or sugar.\nNow, I'm not a huge\nproponent of ketogenic diets\nnor am I against them, I\nthink it's highly individual,\nyou have to decide what's right for you,\nbut everybody needs\namino acids to survive,\nthe brain needs them\nand we need fatty acids,\nespecially to build a healthy\nbrain during development,\nyou need amino acids and fatty acids.\nAnd the sour receptor, why\nwould we have a sour receptor?\nSo, that we could have those\nreally like sour candies?\nI think they've gotten more\nand more sour over the years.\nI admit I don't eat candy much,\nbut I do have a particular weakness\nfor like a really good\nreally sour like gummy peach\nor they if the gummy cherries are dipped\nin whatever that sour powder,\nso I was a kid who I admit it,\nI liked the LIK-M-AID thing,\nI'd like drink the powder.\nPlease don't do this, don't\ngive this garbage to your kids,\nbut I liked it, it was tasty,\nbut sour receptors are not there\nso that you can ingest\ngummy sour gummy peaches\nor something like that, that's\nnot why the system evolved,\nit's there and we know it's there\nto detect the presence of\nspoiled or fermented food.\nFermented fruit has a sour element to it,\nand fermented things while\ncertainly some fermented foods\nlike sauerkraut, and kimchi,\nand things of that sort\ncan be very healthy for us\nand are very healthy in\nreducing inflammation,\nthere's great data on that,\npro quality microbiome, et cetera.\nFermented fruit can be poisonous, right?\nAlcohols are poisonous in\nmany forms to our system\nand the sour receptor bearing neurons\ncommunicate to an area of the brainstem\nthat evokes the pucker response,\nclosing of the eyes and\nessentially shutting of the mouth,\nand cringing away.\nI think cringe is like a thing now,\nmy niece, whenever I seem to\nsay something or do something\nit's either an eye-roll, a\ncringe, or both in combination.\nSo the sour, the sweet,\nthe salty, the bitter,\nand the umami system,\nwere not there so that we could\nhave this wonderful pallet\nof foods that we enjoy so much,\nthey'll allow us to do that,\nbut they're there to make sure\nthat we bring in certain things\nto our system and that we\ndon't ingest other things.\nNow, what's the sixth sense\nwithin the taste system?\nNot sixth sense generally,\nbut within the taste system.\nWhat's this putative\npossible sixth receptor?\nI already kind of hinted at it\nwhen I talked about fatty acids,\nthere are now data to support the idea\nalthough there's still more\nwork that needs to be done\nthat we also have receptors\non our tongue that sense fat.\nAnd that because fat is\nso vital for the function\nof our nervous system and\nthe other organs of our body\nthat we are sensing the\nfat content in food,\nmaybe this is why I can only eat half,\nbut no less than half of\na jar of almond butter\nor peanut butter in one sitting.\nI just can't, unless it's not salted,\nin which case, it makes no sense to me.\nBut it's remarkable how that texture,\nand also the flavor,\nbut that texture of fat.\nI love butter, I am guilty,\nand Costello is definitely\nguilty of eating pats of butter\nfrom time to time, I\nhave no guilt about this.\nPeople eat pats of cheese,\nwhy shouldn't we eat a pat of butter?\nIf you think that's gross\nthen maybe I have a greater abundance\nof the fat receptors in my tongue,\nmaybe I have a fat tongue than you do.\nBut nonetheless, the ability\nto sense fat here in our mouth\nseems to be critical,\nyou can imagine why that is.\nI want to talk about the tongue\nand the mouth as an extension\nof your digestive tract.\nI know that might not be\npleasant to think about,\nbut when you look at it\nthrough the lens that\nI'm about to provide,\nit will completely\nchange the way you think\nabout the gut brain\nand about all the stuff that you've heard\nin these recent years about\noh, we have this second brain,\nit's all these neurons in our gut,\nI've been chuckling through\nthese last few years\nas people have gotten so\nexcited about the gut brain,\nnot because of their excitement,\nI think that excitement is wonderful,\nbut we always knew that the nervous system\nextended out of the\nbrain and into the body,\nand people seem kind of overwhelmed\nand surprised by the idea that\nwe have neurons in our gut\nthat can sense things like\nsugars and fatty acids.\nAnd I think those are\nbeautiful discoveries,\ndon't get me wrong.\nDiego Bohorquez's lab\nout of Duke University\nhas done beautiful studies showing that\nwithin the mucosal lining of our gut\nwe have neurons that sense fatty acids,\nsugars, and amino acids,\nand that when we ingest something\nthat contains one or two\nor three of those things,\nthere's a signal sent via the vagus nerve\nup into what's called the nodose ganglion,\nN-O-D-O-S-E,\nand then into the brain\nwhere it secretes dopamine\nwhich makes us want more of that thing,\nit makes us more motivated to pursue\nand eat more of that thing,\nthat's either fatty, or umami, savory,\nor has a sweet taste,\nany one or two or three\nof those qualities,\nindependent of the taste.\nNow, I think those are beautiful data,\nbut we know that this thing, the mouth.\nAnd for those of you listening\nI've just got my couple\nof fingers in my mouth,\nthat's why I sound like I've\ngot something in my mouth.\nThis thing in the front of our face,\nwe use it for speaking,\nbut it is the front of\nour digestive tract.\nWe are essentially a series of tubes\nand that tube starts with your mouth\nand heads down into your stomach.\nAnd so, that you would sense\nso much of the chemical constituents\nof the stuff that you\nmight bring into your body\nor that you might want\nto expel and not swallow\nor not interact with by being\nable to smell is it putrid?\nDoes it smell good?\nDoes it taste good?\nIs this safe?\nIs it salty?\nIs it so sour that it's fermented\nand it's going to poison me?\nIs it so bitter that it could poison me?\nIs it so savory that, mmm,\nyes. I want more and more of this.\nWell, then you'd want to trigger dopamine,\nthat's all starting in the mouth.\nSo, you have to understand\nthat you were equipped\nwith this amazing chemical\nsensing apparatus,\nwe call your mouth and your tongue.\nAnd those little bumps on your tongue\nthat they call the papillae,\nthose are not your taste buds.\nSurrounding those little papillae\nlike little rivers are these\nlittle dents and indentations.\nAnd what dents and\nindentations do in a tissue\nis they allow more surface area,\nthey allow you to pack more receptors.\nSo, down in those grooves are\nwhere all these little neurons\nand their little processes are\nwith these little receptors\nfor sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,\nand maybe fat as well.\nAnd so, it's this incredible device\nthat you've been equipped with,\nthat you can use to interact\nwith various components\nof the outside world\nand decide whether or not you\nwant to bring them in or not.\nJust as you can lose\nthose olfactory neurons,\nif you happen to get hit on the head\nor you have some other thing,\nmaybe it was an infection that caused loss\nof those olfactory sensory neurons,\nyou can also lose taste\nreceptors in your mouth.\nIf you've ever eaten\nsomething that's too hot,\nnot spicy hot, but too hot,\nyou burn your tongue, you burn receptors.\nIt takes about a week to\nrecover those receptors.\nFor some people it's a\nlittle bit more quickly,\nbut if you burn your tongue badly\nby ingesting a soup that's too hot\nor a beverage that's too hot,\nyou will greatly reduce\nyour sense of taste\nfor essentially all tastes.\nAnd that's because those\nneurons sit very shallow\nbeneath the tongue's surface,\nand so that if you put\nsomething too hot on,\nyou literally just burn\nthose neurons away.\nLuckily those neurons also\ncan replenish themselves.\nThose neurons are of the\nperipheral nervous system,\nand like all peripheral system neurons\nthey can replenish or regenerate.\nSo, if you burn your mouth\nin about a week or so\nhopefully sooner you'll\nbe able to taste again.\nIn fact, everybody's ability to taste\nis highly subject to training.\nYou can really enhance\nyour ability to taste\nand taste the different component\nparts of different foods\nsimply by paying attention to\nwhat you're trying to taste,\nthis is an amazing aspect\nof the taste system.\nI think more than any other system,\nthe taste system and perhaps\nthe smell system as well\ncan be trained so that you can\nlearn to pick out the tones,\nif you will of different ice cream,\nor different beverages.\nI'm somebody who, you know,\nI don't drink much alcohol,\nI'll occasionally have\na drink or something,\nbut a while ago I got to\ntaste a bunch of different\nwhite tequilas, these are\ndifferent kinds of tequilas\nthat are, they're not\nbrown, they're white.\nAnd I sort of assumed that\nall tequila was disgusting,\nthat was my assumption before doing this.\nAnd then I tasted a\ncouple of white tequilas\nand I realized oh, those\naren't aren't too bad.\nI tasted a few more,\nand then pretty soon I\ncould really start to detect\nthe nuance and the difference.\nNow, I haven't had a\ntequilas in a long time,\nnow I sort of tend to not\ndrink at all these days,\nbut in a very short period\nof time like a couple of days\nI got very good at detecting\nwhich things I liked\nand I could start to pick out tones.\nSo, I'm not a wine drinker,\nbut for those of you that are,\nyou know, you hear about\noh, it has floral tones,\nor berry tones, or chocolate tones.\nYou know, some of that is\njust kind of menu-based\nand kind of marketing-based silliness\ndesigned to get you excited\nabout what you're about to ingest.\nBut some of it is real,\nand for people that are skilled\nin assessing wines or assessing foods.\nI'm much more of an eater than a drinker,\nyou can really start to\ndevelop a sensitive palate,\na nuanced palette through what\nwe call top-down mechanisms.\nThis olfactory cortex\nthat takes these five,\nmaybe the sixth fat receptor too,\ninformation and tries to make sense\nof what's out there in the world.\nAnd what its utility is,\nis it good? Is it bad?\nDo I want more of it or less than it?\nThat neural circuitry is\nunlike other neural circuitry\nin that it seems very amenable\nto behavioral plasticity\nfor whatever reason,\nand we could talk about\nwhat those reasons might be.\nYou know, it's interesting sometimes\nto think about how your taste\nliterally, chemical taste,\nis probably very different\nthan that of other people,\nhow a food tastes to you\nis probably very different\nthan how it tastes to somebody else.\nThe same probably cannot\nbe said of something\nlike vision or hearing,\nunless you're somebody\nwho has perfect pitch or your\ncolor vision is disrupted,\nor you're a mantis shrimp,\nchances are when we\nlook at the same object\ntwo people are seeing more\nor less the same object\nor perceiving it in a very similar way.\nThere are experiments that\nessentially establish that.\nNow we, have taste receptors\nand a lot of those tastes receptors,\ntheir chemical structures are known,\nthey come with fancy names\nlike the T1R1 or the T1R2,\nwhich were identified as the\nsweet and umami receptors.\nSo, what's interesting\nis that this umami flavor\nis the savory flavor rather\nthat's sensed by umami\nreceptors is very close\nto the receptor that detects sweet things.\nSimilarly, bitter is sensed\nby a whole other set of receptors.\nNow, there's a fun naturally\noccurring experiment\nthat will forever change the\nway that you look at animals,\nand the way certainly\nthat I think about dogs\nand Costello in particular.\nCarnivorous large animals like tigers\nand some grizzly bears for instance,\nwe know that they have no\nability to detect sweet,\nthey don't actually have the receptors\nfor sweet on their tongue,\nbut their concentration of umami receptors\nof their ability to detect savory\nis at least 5,000 times\nthat which it is in humans.\nIn other words, if I eat\na little piece of steak,\nor Costello eats a little piece of steak,\nthat steak probably tastes much,\nmuch more savory than it does to me.\nSo dogs, and tigers, and bears, et cetera,\nthey're going to taste savory\nthings and smell savory things\nwith a much higher degree of sensitivity,\nbut they can't taste sweet things.\nOther large animals, which\nare mostly herbivores\nlike the panda bear for instance.\nIt's hard to believe that\nthing is even a bear,\nI got nothing against pandas,\nI just think that they\nget a little bit too much\nof the limelight frankly.\nSo, no vendetta against\nPanda, save the pandas,\nI hope they replenish all the pandas,\nbut pandas in all their whatever\nhave no umami receptors,\nthey can't taste savory,\nbut they have greatly heightened\ndensity of sweet receptors.\nSo, there they are eating\nthese whatever bamboos all day\nor not bamboozle, but bamboos all day\nand they can taste things\nthat are very sweet\nwith a much higher degree of intensity.\nAnd in general, animals\nthat are more gentle\nthat are herbivores, excuse me.\nOr animals that have the\npropensity for aggression,\nthat's where you really see the divergence\nof the umami receptor\nbecause it's associated\nwith meat and amino acids.\nAnd where you see the enhancement\nof the sweet receptors\nfor animals that eat a\nlot of plants and fruits,\nand they probably taste\nvery different to them\nthan they do to you and me.\nAnd, so it's interesting to note\nthat animals that eat meat,\nthat eat other organisms\ncan actually extract more\nsavory experience from that.\nWhat does this mean for you?\nAll right, do you associate\nyourself as a tiger,\nor a grizzly bear, or a panda,\nor a combination of both?\nMost people are omnivores.\nHowever, you may find it\ninteresting that people\nthat for instance eat a\npure carnivore type diet\nor a keto diet where they\nare ingesting a lot of meat,\nso therefore are sensing\na lot of umami flavors.\nAnd I realized not everyone\nwho's keto eats meat,\nbut those who do that will\ndevelop a more sensitive palate\nand likely there are some\ndata, although early data,\ncraving for umami-like foods.\nWhereas people that eat\na more plant-based diet\nare likely developing a\nheightened sensitivity\nand desire for, and maybe even\ndopamine response to sugars\nand plant-based foods.\nNow, this is my partial\nattempt to reconcile\nthe kind of online battle\nthat seems to exist\nbetween plant-based versus animal-based,\npurely plant-based or\npurely animal-based diets.\nI think most people are omnivores,\nbut it's kind of interesting to think\nthat the systems are plastic\nsuch that people might want more meat\nif they eat more meat,\npeople might want more plants\nif they eat enough plants\nfor a long period of time.\nAnd this might explain some\nof the chasm that exists\nbetween these two groups.\nNow, this is not to say\nanything about the ethical\nor the environmental\nimpacts of different things,\nI don't even want to get into that\nbecause the meat people say\nthat the plant-based diets\nhave as much a negative impact\nas the plant people say\nthat the meat based diets,\nthat's a totally different discussion.\nWhat I'm talking about here is\nfood craving and food seeking\nand one's ability to detect\nthese umami, savory flavors\nis going to be enhanced\nby ingesting more meat\nand less activation of\nthe sweet receptors.\nSo in other words, the more meat you eat\nthe more you're going to become\nlike a tiger, so to speak.\nAnd the more that you avoid\nthese umami flavors and meats\nand the more that you\nwould eat plant-based foods\nand in particular sweet foods,\nthe more you will likely\nsuppress that umami system\nand that you will have\na heightened desire for,\nappetite for and sensing of sweet foods\nor foods that contain sugars.\nWhat I'm about to tell you\nis going to seem crazy,\nbut is extremely interesting\nwith respect to taste and taste receptors.\nRemember, even though we can enjoy food\nand we can evolve our sense\nof what's tasty or not tasty,\ndepending on life decisions,\nenvironmental changes, et cetera,\nthe taste system just\nlike the olfactory system\nand the visual system\nwas laid down for the purpose\nof moving towards things\nthat are good for us\nand moving away from\nthings that are bad for us,\nthat's the kind of core\nfunction of the nervous system.\nWell, taste receptors are not\njust expressed on the tongue,\nthey are expressed in other\ncells and other tissues as well.\nSome of you may be able to imagine foods\nthat are so delicious to you\nthat they make your entire body feel good.\nOr foods that are so\nhorrifically awful to think about\nlet alone taste, that they\ncreate a whole body shuddering\nor kind of repellent-type response\nwhere you just either cringe\nor turn your face away\neven in the absence of that food.\nThat's sort of how I feel about\npungent, Gorgonzola cheese.\nIf you like Gorgonzola\ncheese, I don't judge you,\nI just, that's an individual difference.\nI happen to love certain foods,\nI do like savory foods very much.\nI, when I think about them,\nthey just they make me feel good.\nAnd I'm oftentimes not even associating\nwith the taste of those foods,\nit feels almost like a visceral thing.\nWell, it turns out that\nsome of the taste receptors\nextend beyond the tongue,\nthat they actually can extend\ninto portions of the gut\nand digestive system.\nAnd if that's not strange enough,\nturns out that some of the taste receptors\nare actually expressed on\nthe ovaries and the testes.\nSo, what that means is that the gonads,\nthe very cells, and tissues,\nand organs in our body\nthat make up the reproductive axis\nare expressing taste receptors.\nOkay, so how do we interpret this?\nDoes this mean that when you eat something\nthat's very savory or\nvery sweet for instance,\nthat it's triggering activation\nof the ovaries or of the testes?\nWell, it's possible.\nNow, how those molecules,\nthose chemical molecules\nwould actually get there\nisn't clear, the digestive\ntrack does not run directly\nto the testes or to the ovaries.\nBut nonetheless, what this\nmeans is that chemical sensing\nof the very things that\nwe detect on our tongue\nand that we call taste in quotes in food\nis also evoking\ncellular responses within\nthe reproductive gonads.\nNow, whether or not this\nunderlies the positive association\nthat we have with certain\nfoods isn't clear,\nbut I'd be remiss if I\ndidn't point out the obvious,\nwhich is that the relationship\nbetween the sensual nature\nof particular foods\nand sensuality generally\nand the reproductive axis\nis something that's been\ncovered in many movies,\nthere are entire movies that are focused\non the relationship between for instance,\nchocolate and love and\nreproductive behaviors,\nor certain feasts of meat\nand their wonderful tastes\nand the kind of sensuality around feasts\nof different types of foods,\nbut in general, it's the\nsweet and the savory,\nrarely is it the sour or the\nbitter, the salty or the fat.\nAnd not surprisingly perhaps,\nit is the T2Rs and the T1Rs,\nthe receptors that are\nassociated with the sweet\nand with the umami, the savory flavors\nthat are expressed not just on the tongue\nand in portions of the digestive tract,\nbut on the gonads themselves.\nSo, what does this mean?\nDoes this mean that eating certain foods\ncan stimulate the gonads?\nMaybe, there's no data that immediately\nsupport that right now, but\nthis is an emerging area.\nIf you'd like to read more about this\nthere's a great review,\nentitled Taste perception:\nFrom the tongue to the testis,\nalthough they do also\ntalk about the ovaries.\nWhy they didn't include that in the title\nis I think a reflection\nof the bias of the author.\nThe author indeed not\nincidentally is Feng Li,\nlast name L-I.\nIt's a very interesting paper published\nin Molecular Human Reproduction.\nYou can find it easily\nonline, it's downloadable,\nI'll also provide a link to it.\nI just think it's fascinating\nthat these taste receptors are\nexpressed in other tissues.\nAnd I should mention\nthat they're expressed\nin tissues of other areas\nof the body as well,\nincluding the respiratory system,\nbut the richest aggregation\nor concentration of these receptors\nfor umami and sweet of\ncourse is on the tongue,\nbut also on the gonads.\nAnd I think it does speak\nto the possible bridge between\nwhat we think of as a sensory\nor a sensual experience of food\nand the deeper kind of\nvisceral sense within the gut,\nand maybe even within the gonads as well\nof something that we find\nextremely pleasurable,\nor even appetitive that\nwe want to move toward it.\nWe are actually going to\nreturn to that general theme\nin the discussion about touch sensation.\nSome people for instance,\nwhen they touch certain\nsurfaces like furs,\nor sheep skins, or velvet,\nor soft, smooth surfaces\nit feels good elsewhere in their body,\nnot just at the point of\ncontact with that surface.\nAnd similarly, if there's the...\nHow about this one?\nThe screech of chalk on a\nchalkboard, it's a sound,\nbut it has a very strong\nvisceral component,\nor sandpaper, like\nfingernails on a chalkboard,\nnot the sound, but the feeling, right?\nExactly, so our whole\nnervous system is tuned\nto either be drawn toward appetitive,\nor repelled by aversive behaviors, right?\nSo there's this push-pull that exists,\nand what I'm referring to\nin terms of these receptors\non the tongue that are also\nexpressed on the gonads\nis yet another example of\nwhat at least in this case\nseems to be an appetitive thing,\na desire to move toward certain foods\nand maybe even the experiences\nthat are associated with those foods.\nI want to talk about a particular aspect\nof food and a chemical reaction in cooking\ncalled the Maillard reaction.\nSome of you have probably\nheard of the Maillard reaction,\nit's spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.\nThe D is silent, so don't\ncall it the Maillard reaction,\nand it's not the Maillard reaction,\nit is the Maillard reaction.\nAnd the Maillard reaction is a reaction\nthat for the aficionados is\na non-enzymatic browning.\nThe other form of non-enzymatic\nbrowning is caramelization,\nalthough when you hear caramel, carmel,\nI think it's caramel.\nYou think sweet, and indeed\ncaramelization is a sugar-sugar\nchemical interaction that leads\nto a kind of nicely toasted\nnot burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.\nWhereas the Maillard reaction\nis that really savory reaction\nthat occurs when you have a\nsugar amino acid reaction.\nRemember, we have neurons in our gut,\nbut also neurons in our tongue\nand neurons deep in the brain\nthat are comparing the amount\nof sugar to savory.\nOkay, and the Maillard\nreaction is very interesting\nfor you chemists out there,\nthis is going to be way too elementary.\nAnd for you non-chemists\nit's probably going to be\na little bit of a reach,\nbut just bear with me, all\nthese chemicals that we sense\nhave a different structure,\nit's like hydrogens, and oxygens,\nand aldehyde groups, and all these things.\nAnd basically the Maillard reaction\ninvolves what's called a free aldehyde.\nIf you didn't like chemistry,\ndon't worry about it,\nit's basically got a group\nthere that kind of sits open\nthat allows it to interact\nwith other things and actually\nthrough the use of heat\nand the process that we call brazing,\nwhich I'll talk about in a moment\nyou create a what's called a ketone group.\nNow, most people now have heard of ketones\n'cause they think about\nthe ketogenic diet,\nbut a ketone group is\nactually a chemical compound\nthat can be used for energy,\nand that's why people say you\ncan use ketones for energy,\nbut if you've ever actually\nencountered ketones,\nif you for instance, get liquid ketones,\na ketone ester, and you smell it,\nwhat does it smell like?\nIt smells a little bit like an alcohol,\nbut it has a kind of savory taste,\neven when you smell it.\nOkay, there are other smells\nthat have these tastes too,\nbut for the Maillard reaction\nwhich could be created for instance\nlike if you took a piece of meat,\nor if you're not a meat eater\nif you took tomatoes and\nyou cook them in a pan\nand you cooked it nice and\nslow till it's simmered\nand almost started to brown\nand burn a little bit.\nUsually if I do it burns,\nI'm not a good cook\nas Costello points out a lot,\nbut it gets that like almost\ntangy, very umami-like flavor.\nAnd sometimes it will\neven stick to the pan,\nif you scrape it off\nand actually you can\ntaste it in your mouth\nas you're cooking it.\nThat's the Maillard reaction,\nthat's that free aldehyde group,\nand that's the production\nof a ketone group.\nWhen you smell ketones, it\nsmells very much like that.\nOkay, some people talk about the ketones\nwill produce like fruity breath.\nAnd that's true if people\nare really far into ketosis,\ntheir breath has a kind of fruity odor,\nthat's a little bit of a different thing.\nSo, the relationship\nbetween smell and taste\nis a very, very close one.\nAnd this is why when people drink wine\nthey often will inhale and then sip,\nsome of that is just kind of like pomp\nand circumstance frankly,\nthey make a big deal of it,\nbut they can sense\nthings with their mouth.\nThe combination of odor receptors\nbeing activated in a particular way,\nand taste receptors in\nthe mouth being activated\nin a particular way,\ntriggers the activation\nof multiple brain areas that\nare associated with taste,\nand circuitry within the body\nthat's associated with the behaviors\nthat relate to that taste\nlike leaning toward it,\nor leaning away from it\ndepending on whether or not\nit's appetitive or aversive.\nSo the Maillard reaction is\na very interesting reaction\ninvolving this sugar amino acid thing,\nbut really it's what it's\ndoing is heating up food\nsuch that the amino\nacids are more available\nliterally in their chemical form\nfor detection by the neurons.\nThis is a phenomenon that occurs\nin other domains of the taste system.\nFor instance, a lot of what's happened\nwith highly processed foods\nis that manufacturers have figured out\nhow to trigger more dopamine response\nby ingestion of these sugary\nfoods and created textures,\nand created essentially design\nof foods for two purposes.\nI'm not out to completely\ndemonize processed food,\nI did that in a previous episode,\nbut processed foods are\nreally designed to take foods\nthat ordinarily would spoil,\nthat would have a shelf life\nand extend their shelf life\nto turn foods which are not\na commodity into a commodity.\nSomething could be stored and\nused essentially as a tradable\npurchasable, sellable resource.\nIn doing that they change,\nthey've also decided to change the texture\nso that you want to chew more of them.\nLike I have this thing\nI don't know what it is for\nthose Triscuit crackers.\nI don't know why are those things so good?\nIt's probably the\ntexture, got those layers,\nthey're just kind of perfectly salty.\nI haven't had one in a long time,\nso I bet if I had one now\nit wouldn't taste as good\nas I'm imagining it.\nBut those combinations of\ntexture, smell, and taste\nare what combine to activate\nthese different brain areas\nthat make you really\nwant to desire something.\nAnd the people who make foods,\nprocessed foods in particular,\nare phenomenally good at figuring out\nwhat drives the dopamine\nsystem and makes you want more\nof these things either\nbecause of the way they taste\nand/or because of the\nway they trigger neurons\nin your gut that have\nnothing to do with taste\nthat simply make you\ndesire more of the food.\nIn other words, many of the\nfoods that are processed foods\nmake you desire more of them,\nit's impossible to eat\none chip kind of thing.\nNot because they taste good,\nbut because in your gut\nthey're activating the neurons\nthat activate dopamine\nwhich make you seek more of those foods\nindependent of blood\nsugar or anything else.\nSo, you may actually be\neating more particular foods\nnot because they taste good,\nbut because they feel good\non your tongue and mouth,\nand because the neurons in your gut\nwhich are totally independent\nof conscious taste\nare triggering the release of dopamine\nwhich is a molecule that\nmakes you seek more of,\nand do more of anything\nthat led to the ingestion of that food.\nThere's a fun experiment that you can do,\nwhich is to completely invert\nyour sense of sweet and sour,\nthere's actually a way to do this readily.\nWhen I was a post-doc,\nI used to have a journal club at my house,\npeople would come over in\nthe evening once a month,\nand we would read a paper,\ntypically the weirdest paper we could find\nand we would eat food and hang out,\nthat's what nerds did and do for fun,\nso that's what we did.\nAnd one time someone brought\nwhat's called miracle berry.\nOkay, so this isn't some\npsychedelic plant medicine thing,\nmiracle berry, you can purchase online,\nit's relatively inexpensive.\nIt actually causes a change\nin the configuration of taste receptors\nsuch that when you eat\nsomething sour, it tastes sweet.\nAnd so what's really wild\nis you ingest miracle berry,\nand then you bite into a lemon,\nmaybe even the lemon and peel\nand it tastes as sweet as a peach.\nAnd this effect lasts several hours.\nDefinitely, you know, check any warnings,\nI don't know what sort of warnings these,\na miracle berry carries,\nbut I'm sure there's always\nsomething, you can imagine.\nThere are a number of\npapers on miracle berry\nor miracle fruit it's called,\nbut it changes your perception of sour\nat a perceptual level,\nbut it does that by changing the activity\nof the receptors in the mouth and tongue.\nNow, this is important as a\nprinciple and it's underscored\nby experiments that have\nbeen done by for instance\nCharles Zuker's lab at\nColumbia University,\nwhere they've essentially\ngenetically engineered animals\nsuch that the bitter receptor is swapped\nwith the sweet receptor,\nor the sweet receptor is swapped\nwith the bitter receptor.\nAnd what they show is\nthat the actual food,\nthe experience on the tongue\ndrives different pathways in the brain.\nHere's what they did,\nthey essentially took mice\nand swapped out the sweet receptor\nand put in a bitter receptor.\nAnd then what they found is that\nwhereas normally mice\nwould actively seek out\nand even work for sugar water, sucrose,\nthey really like that.\nIf they replace the sweet\nreceptor with the bitter receptor,\nthe mice would avoid sugar water.\nAnd the reverse was also true,\nthat mice would drink a\nbitter solution avidly,\nthey liked a bitter solution\nif they swapped out the bitter\nreceptor for sweet receptor.\nWhat this means is that\nour entire experience\nof what we taste is dependent\non how we experience that\ntaste the level of the tongue.\nAnd so, you're hopefully not\ngoing to do genetic engineering\nof your taste receptors,\nbut if you'd like to do\nthis sort of experiment\nyou actually can do it very\neasily using miracle fruit,\nthe instructions of how\nmuch to ingest, et cetera,\nany safety concerns are\nusually on the package\nand should be easy to find.\nAnd there's a lot of science\nto support how this works,\nit's kind of a fun\nexperiment that anyone can do\nand will completely change your perception\nof any food that you're\naccustomed to eating.\nIn fact, you can figure out how much sweet\nor the sense of sweetness\nis contributing to your\nexperience of a food,\neven if you don't think\nof it as a sweet food\nthrough this miracle fruit experiment.\nYou could take miracle fruit,\nyou could eat a slice of\npepperoni pizza or cheese pizza,\nwhich perhaps normally to you\nwould taste just like pizza,\nand you'll notice it\ntastes very different.\nWhat you are detecting is\nhow much the sense of sweet\nwas contributing to\nthat particular flavor.\nNow, I'd like to return to pheromones.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\ntrue pheromonal effects are\nwell-established in animals.\nAnd one of the most\nremarkable pheromone effects\nthat's ever been described\nis one that actually I've\nmentioned before on this podcast,\nbut I'll mention again just briefly,\nwhich is the Coolidge effect.\nThe Coolidge effect is the effect\nof a male of a given species,\nin most cases, it tended to be\na rodent or a rooster mating.\nAnd at some point reaching exhaustion\nor the inability to mate again\nbecause they just simply\ncouldn't for whatever reason.\nThe Coolidge effect establishes\nthat if you swap out the hen\nwith a new hen, or the female\nrat or mouse with a new one\nthen the rat or the rooster\nspontaneously regains\ntheir ability to mate,\nsomehow their vigor is returned,\nthe refractory period after\nmating that normally occurs\nis abolished and they can mate again.\nIt turns out that the Coolidge effect\nruns in the opposite direction too.\nI did not know this, but I\nrecently learned of a study,\nit was actually done in\nhamsters, not in in mice,\nbut it turns out that females also will,\nfemale rodents will mate to exhaustion.\nAnd at some port...\nAt some point, excuse me,\nthey will refuse to mate any longer\nunless you swap in a new male.\nAnd then because mating in rodents\ninvolves the female being receptive,\nthere are certain number of behaviors\nthat mean that tell you that she's willing\nand wanting to mate,\nso-called lordosis reflex.\nThen if there's a new male,\nshe will spontaneously\nregain the lordosis reflex\nand the desire to mate.\nAnd how do you know this?\nHow do we know it's a pheromonal effect?\nWell, this recovery of the\ndesire and ability to mate\nboth in males and in females\ncan be evoked completely by the odor\nof a new male or female,\nit doesn't even have\nto be the presentation\nof the actual animal.\nAnd that's how you know\nthat it's not some visual interaction\nor some other interaction,\nit's a pheromonal interaction.\nNow, as I mentioned\nearlier, pheromonal effects\nin humans have been debated\nfor a long period of time.\nWe are thought to have a vestigial,\nmeaning a kind of shrunken down\nminiature accessory olfactory\nbulb called Jacobson's organ,\nor the vomeronasal organ.\nSome people don't believe\nthat Jacobson's organ exists,\nsome people do, there is\nanatomical evidence for it\nin some cadavers.\nIt sits not very high up in the brain\nor where your olfactory bulb is,\nbut it's actually in the nasal passages,\nso there's like little dents\nas you go up through your nasal passages,\nand there is evidence of\nsomething that's vomeronasal-like.\nVomeronasal is the pheromonal organ,\nthey call it Jacobson's organ\nif it's present in humans,\nkind of tucked into some of the\ndivots in the nasal passage.\nEven if that organ,\nJacobson's organ isn't there\nor is not responsible\nfor the chemical signaling\nbetween individuals,\nthere is chemical signaling\nbetween human beings.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nthe effect of tears\nin suppressing the areas of the brain\nthat are involved in sexual desire\nand testosterone of males,\nthat's a concrete result,\nthat's a very good result\npublished by an excellent group\nwith no pre-existing bias going in,\nthat's just what they found.\nThere is also evidence\nboth for and against\nchemical signaling between females\nin terms of synchronization\nof menstrual cycles.\nNow, the original paper on\nthis was published in the 1970s\nby McClintock, and it essentially said\nthat when women live together\nin group housing, dormitories,\nand similar that their menstrual\ncycles were synchronized\nand that was due to what was hypothesized\nto be pheromonal effects.\nOver the years,\nthat study has been\nchallenged many, many times.\nThe more recent data point to the idea\nthat there is chemical-chemical\nsignaling between women\nin ways that impact the\ntiming of the menstrual cycle,\nbut that depending on whether or not\nsome of the women are\nin the ovulation phase,\nthe ovulatory phase of that cycle\nor whether or not they are\nin the follicular phase,\nthe phase when the follicle is maturing\nbefore the egg actually obviates.\nSo two separate phases of\nthe 28 day menstrual cycle\nwill either lengthen or\nshorten the menstrual cycle\nof the person that smells those women.\nTranslated into English what that means\nis that it is very likely it seems\nthat something, maybe pheromones,\nbut maybe some other chemical\nthat is independent of\npheromones is being conveyed\nbetween women that are housed together\nor spend a lot of time together\nto shift their menstrual cycle,\nbut it doesn't necessarily\nmean that they synchronize.\nSo for instance, if one woman\nis in the follicular phase\nof the menstrual cycle,\nit might shorten or delay ovulation.\nExcuse me, it might accelerate\novulation in another woman,\nwhereas if somebody is\nin the ovulatory phase\nof their cycle, it might\nlengthen the menstrual cycle\nout so that they, the woman\nwho smells that person's scent\nor who smells her sweat,\nwe still don't know the\norigin of the chemical\nwould ovulate later.\nSo, all of this is to say\nis that chemical-chemical\nsignaling is happening\nfrom females to males\nthrough tears, we know that.\nIs that a pheromonal effect?\nWell, by the strict\ndefinition of a pheromone,\na molecule that's released\nfrom one individual\nthat impacts the biology\nof another individual, yes.\nBut in terms of identifying\nwhat the pheromone is in tears,\nthat's still unknown,\nit's not clear what the\nchemical compound is.\nSo, we're reluctant as scientists\nto call it a true pheromonal effect.\nThe menstrual cycle\nand the synchronization\nof the menstrual cycle\neffect seems to hold up\nunder some conditions.\nBut in some cases,\nthere's a kind of clash of\nmenstrual cycles that's created\nby chemicals that are emitted\nfrom one female to another.\nSo, there are many\nexamples of this in humans,\nfor instance, people can recognize\nthe t-shirt of their mate.\nIf you give...\nThis experiment has been done many times,\nI know it's been challenged\na number of times,\nbut the data are pretty good\nby now that if you offer,\nyou take a collection of women\nwho are in stable\nrelationships with somebody,\nyou offer them the smell of\na hundred different shirts\nand they can very readily pick out\ntheir significant others scent.\nOkay, that's pure olfaction,\nthat's not pheromonal,\nbut nonetheless is a remarkable\ndegree of discrimination,\nolfactory discrimination.\nYou can dilute their partner's scent\ndown to the point where they themselves\ncan't consciously detect the difference\nbetween the sweat or the t-shirt\nof a hundred different t-shirts or so,\nthey might say, \"I don't\nreally smell the difference,\nbut I think it's this one.\nYeah, this one belongs to the\nperson that I've been with.\"\nAnd they are much greater than chance\nat detecting the t-shirt\nor identifying the t-shirt correctly.\nSo, there's no question really\nthat there is chemical-chemical\nsignaling between humans,\nthe question is whether or not\nit's truly pheromonal in basis.\nNow, you'll notice that a\nlot of the examples I gave\naside from the one of tears\nis women detecting the scents\nof men or of other women.\nAnd it turns out that there\nare a number of papers,\nthe best one I think\nthat I could find is published\nin Physiology and Behavior\nin 2009, it's a review\nentitled Sex Differences and\nReproductive Hormone Influences\non Human Odor Perception\nby Doty, D-O-T-Y, and Cameron.\nI encourage you to check out this review\nit's available free as a download,\nwe'll provide a link to it,\nyou can get the full PDF if you want.\nBut it does seem that women\nare better at detecting\nodors in these odor\ndiscrimination tasks than are men.\nAnd yes, that it does vary\naccording to where they are\nin their menstrual cycle.\nAnd yes, they also looked at people\nwho had received gonadectomy,\nthey had their ovaries removed,\na number of different important controls.\nNone of this surprises me,\nnone of this should surprise you,\nit's very clear that hormones\nhave a profound effect\non enlarge number of systems\nin our biology and that smell, and taste,\nand the ability to sense the\nchemical states of others,\neither consciously or subconsciously\nhave a profound influence\non whether or not we might\nwant to spend time with them,\nwhether or not this is somebody\nthat we're pair bonded with,\nwhether or not this is somebody\nthat we just met and don't\ntrust yet, things of this sort.\nAnd given what's at stake in\nterms of reproductive biology,\nnot just offspring, but\ngiven the possibility\nof transmission of diseases, et cetera,\nyou know, the risks of\nchildbirth, et cetera.\nIt makes so much sense\nthat much of our biology\nis wired toward detecting\nand sensing whether or not\nthings and people are things\nthat we should approach\nor avoid, whether or not reproduction\nwith that person is the\nappropriate response\nor suppression of the\nreproductive response\nis the appropriate response, right?\nAs in that's the case with the tears.\nSo, I think these are fascinating studies,\nit's an area that still\nneeds a lot of work,\nbut there are some really\nwonderful papers on this.\nAnd the one that I\nmentioned a few minutes ago,\nSex Differences and\nReproductive Hormone Influences\non Human Odor Perception\nis one of the better\nreviews that are out there.\nThere are also a number of other reviews\nfor instance that talk\nabout pheromone effects\nand their impact on mood,\nand sexual responses,\nand things of that sort,\nand we will also provide\nsome links to those.\nA lot of this is still speculative,\nbut I want to say I know\nI said it three times,\nwhat I really want to underscore\nbecause it is vitally important,\nand people seem to get a little triggered\nby the notion of pheromones.\nJust because we haven't identified\nthe actual chemical compound\nthat's acting as a pheromone\nor putative pheromone\ndoes not mean that\nchemical-chemical signaling\nbetween individuals doesn't\nexist, clearly it does.\nActually, you and every other human\nfrom the time you're born\nuntil the time you die\nare actively seeking out\nand sensing and evaluating\nthe chemicals that come\nfrom other individuals.\nThere's a really nice study that was done\nby the Weizmann Institute, a group there,\nI think it was also Noam Sobel's group,\nbut another group as well as I recall\nlooking at human-human interactions\nwhen they meet for the first time.\nIt's a remarkable study\nbecause what they found\nwas people would reach\nout and shake hands.\nIt's is a typical response,\nyou know pre-pandemic, people would meet,\nthey'd reach out and\nthey would shake hands.\nAnd what they observed\nwas almost every time\nwithin just a few seconds\nof having shaken hands\nwith this new individual,\npeople will touch their\neyes almost without fail.\nOccasionally, they would\ntouch their eyebrow,\noccasionally someone\nwould touch their hair.\nWe always associate that with\npeople having some sort of...\nOr us having some sort of\nself-conscious response\nlike oh, we want to make\nsure shirt tucked in\nand all prim and proper, whatever it is,\nor looking right, is there\nsomething you're like teeth?\nThis kind of thing,\nbut actually people are doing that\neven if the person they\njust met left the room.\nSo, someone's sitting there,\nsomeone comes in, they shake hands,\nand the person inevitably\nsubconsciously touches their eyes.\nThey are taking chemicals\nfrom the skin contact\nand they are placing it on a\nmucosal membrane of some sort,\ntypically not up to their\nnose or in their mouth,\ntypically on their eyes.\nNow, animals do this all the time,\nthere's a phenomenon in\nanimals called bunting.\nIf you have a overeager dog\nthat when you meet them\nor you see them again\nafter you've been away for the day\nthey'll rub their head against you, right?\nCats will do this too,\nit's called bunting,\nthey're rubbing their scent glands on you,\nthey're marking you.\nAnd believe it or not,\nyou're marking other people\nwhen you shake their hand,\nand they are then taking your mark\nand rubbing it on\nthemselves subconsciously.\nSo, we all do these kinds of behaviors,\nand now that you're aware of it\nyou can watch for it in your environment,\nyou can pay attention to people.\nSome of this has probably changed\nin light of the events of 2020, et cetera,\nbut nonetheless, we are evaluating\nthe molecules on people's breath,\nwe are evaluating the\nmolecules on people's skin\nby actively rubbing it on ourselves.\nAnd we are actively involved\nin sensing not just\ntheir facial expressions,\nthe size of their pupils,\nand things like that,\nbut the chemicals that they are emitting,\ntheir hormone status, how they smell.\nWe're detecting the pheromones possibly,\nbut certainly the odors in their breath.\nYou might say, \"Well, I\ndon't actually go around\nsniffing people's breath.\nI don't, you know, unless if it's bad,\"\nin which case it's aversive,\nbut breath is communicating\na lot of signals.\nAnd this handshake eye rub experiment\nshows that we are actively\ngoing through behaviors\nreflexively to wipe ourselves\nor smear ourselves with\nother people's chemicals.\nNow, that might seem odd\nor even gross to you,\nbut I think it's beautiful,\nI think that it illustrates\nthe extent to which we as human beings\nare in some ways among the other animals\nin our subconscious, sometimes conscious,\nbut certainly subconscious\ntendency to try and evaluate\nour chemical environment\nthrough what we inhale through our nose,\nwhat we ingest through our mouth,\nand what we actively take\noff other people's skin\nand rub on ourselves to evaluate it\nand what we should do about it,\nand perhaps that person as well.\nSo today, we talked a\nlot about olfaction taste\nand chemical sensing between individuals.\nI'd like to think that you now know a lot\nabout how your smell system works\nand why inhaling is a really\ngood thing to do in general\nfor waking up your brain,\nand for cognitive function,\nand for enhancing your sense of smell.\nWe talked about how to\nenhance your sense of taste,\nand we talked about chemical signaling\nbetween individuals as\na way of communicating\nsome important aspects about biology.\nPeople are shaping each\nother's biology all the time\nby way of these chemicals\nthat are being traded\nfrom one body to the next\nthrough air, and skin to\nskin contact, and tears.\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\nand you're finding the information useful\nplease subscribe on YouTube,\nthat's one of the best ways to support us.\nYou can
