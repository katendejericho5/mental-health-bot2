    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[gentle music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nFounded by two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford,\nRoka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nhave really been designed\nwith the utmost care\nand the utmost attention\nto the science of optics\nand the visual system.\nSo one of the things I like so much\nabout Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nis that they're extremely lightweight.\nIf you get sweaty, so for instance,\nif you wear them while\nrunning, or walking, or hiking,\nthey don't slip off.\nAnd with the sunglasses,\nwhen you're outdoors,\nif there's cloud cover,\nor if there's shadows,\nor if the day gets brighter or dimmer,\nyou can still see your\nsurroundings perfectly well.\nAnd that's because the designers at Roka\nreally understand the way\nthe visual system works\nhow it habituates, how it adapts.\nYou don't need to understand the science\nbehind all that, but they do,\nand as a consequence the\neyeglasses perform extremely well\nunder all conditions,\nwhether or not that's indoors or outdoors.\nSo they put a ton of science\nand purpose into the design.\nThey also happen to look really good.\nThey have a really nice aesthetic.\nA lot of, as you know,\nperformance active wear eyeglasses\nlook rather ridiculous, but\nthe Roka glasses, I think,\nhave a very nice aesthetic to them\nthat you can wear anywhere.\nIf you'd like to check out Roka glasses,\nyou can go to Roka, that's roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout,\nand you'll get 20% off your first order.\nThat's Roka, R-O-K-A .com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout\nfor 20% off your order.\nToday's podcast is also brought\nto us by Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate\nand longterm health\ncan only be analyzed from a blood test.\nAnd now, with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nwe can also get insight\ninto our specific DNA makeup\nand how that influences\nour lifestyle choices\nand our health status.\nThe problem with a lot of blood tests\nis that you get a lot of information back,\nbut you don't always know what\nto do with that information.\nWith Inside Tracker, they\nhave a very easy to use,\npersonalized dashboard platform\nthat informs you what sorts of lifestyle,\nnutrition, exercise, changes\nyou might want to make,\naccording to the levels of\nparticular metabolic factors,\nhormone factors, et cetera,\nin your blood and DNA.\nSo it makes everything very simple,\nboth in terms of where\nyou're at health-wise\nand what you should or could do,\nin order to improve your health,\nsomething I do believe most\neverybody would like to do.\nWith Inside Tracker, it\nmakes all that very easy.\nThey also have something\ncalled the inner age test.\nThis is a test that shows\nyou what your biological age\nand compares to that, of course,\nto your chronological age.\nAnd, of course, your biological age\nis really what you want to know,\nbecause it's a predictor of\nhow long you're going to live\nand the quality of your life.\nIf you'd like to try Inside Tracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of Inside Tracker's plans,\njust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are ideally suited\nto your sleep needs.\nEverybody needs something different\nin terms of what to sleep on.\nSome people like a hard mattress.\nSome people like a soft mattress.\nSome people tend to run warm.\nSome people tend to run cold.\nWith Helix Sleep, you go to their website,\nyou take a very brief two-minute quiz,\nand you answer some questions such as,\ndo you tend to sleep on your stomach,\nor your side, or your back?\nMaybe you don't know.\nDo you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera.\nAt the end of that quiz, you\nmatch to a specific mattress.\nI took that quiz about six months ago,\nand I matched to the Dusk Mattress,\nand I've been sleeping on\na Dusk mattress from Helix\nfor the last six months,\nand I've been sleeping better\nthan I ever have before.\nBasically, everyone's unique,\nand Helix understands that,\nand that's built into the\ndesign of their mattresses\nand this two-minute quiz that\nyou take to match you to one.\nIf you'd like to try a\nHelix Sleep mattress,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two-minute quiz,\nand they'll match you to\na customized mattress.\nYou'll also get up to $200\noff any mattress order\nand two free pillows.\nThey make terrific pillows.\nYou'll get a 10-year\nwarranty on that mattress,\nand you get to try it out\nfor 100 nights risk-free.\nIf you don't like it,\nthey'll come pick it up and take it away.\nYou won't get charged,\nyou'll get your money back, et cetera.\nSo that's helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off and two free pillows.\nWe are now beginning a new topic\nfor the next four to five episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nBefore we move into that,\nI want to just briefly\ntouch on a couple questions\nthat I got from the last episode,\nwhich was related to the\nscience of endurance training.\nI described the four kinds\nof endurance training.\nWe posted protocols of\nthe specific four kinds\nof endurance training at hubermanlab.com.\nJust go to that episode,\nyou can see the download,\nit's a zero-cost PDF.\nI got a lot of questions\nabout what's called concurrent training,\nwhich is how to program endurance training\nif you are also interested\nin strength and hypertrophy training.\nOr how to incorporate strength\nand hypertrophy training,\nwhich was in the previous\nepisode, with endurance training.\nThis can all be made very simple.\nAsk yourself, what are\nyou trying to emphasize,\nand then emphasize that\nfor a 10 to 12 week cycle.\nSo if you're mostly\ninterested in endurance,\nI would say use a three to two ratio,\nmaybe get three endurance\ntraining workouts per week,\nmaybe four, and two strength\nand hypertrophy workouts.\nIf you're mainly focusing\non strength and hypertrophy,\nget three or four workouts\nfor strength and hypertrophy\nand do two endurance workouts.\nStart with the minimum number\nof sets that's required\nto get the result that you want.\nSo if you're not accustomed\nto doing endurance work,\nyou would start with the minimum number\nthat's listed on that protocol.\nSo if it says three to five sets,\nyou would start with\nthree, maybe even just two,\nand then work your way up\nby adding sets each week.\nI do suggest that people get\nat least one complete rest day per week.\nAnd although I know a lot\nof people don't like that,\nI benefit from that.\nI actually benefit from having\ntwo complete rest days each week.\nI just continue to make progress that way,\nwhether or not it's for\nstrength and hypertrophy\nor for endurance.\nI am a big believer in rest\ndays, other people are not.\nAnd those could be active rest days,\nhiking, relaxing, et cetera.\nAfter a 10 to 12 week cycle,\nthen I also suggest taking anywhere\nfrom five to seven days completely off.\nYou can still enjoy life and do things,\nI know for you addicted exercisers\nthat you're going to loathe to do that,\nbut that's one way to stay injury free,\nkeep your joints and\ntissues healthy over time,\nand continue to make progress.\nIf you don't want to do\nthat week off, don't do it.\nNone of this is holy.\nNone of it is a strict prescriptive.\nJust ask yourself, what\nare you going to emphasize\nand emphasize that, in\nterms of the total volume\nof workouts that you do,\nand work up incrementally,\nand then move into another cycle.\nThat's what I suggest.\nSo go to hubermanlab.com,\nyou can get the protocol there.\nWe are now going to move into a new topic\nunrelated to physical performance.\nStarting with this episode\nand for the next four to five episodes,\nwe are going to talk all about the senses.\nThat's sight, eyesight,\nhearing, touch, taste, smell,\nand we're also going to talk\nabout this critical sense\nthat we call interoception,\nor our sense of our internal real estate.\nNow, the reason that we are\ntalking about the senses\nis because if you understand\nhow the senses are perceived,\nwhat they're about, what\nthe underlying cells\nand connections are about,\nyou will be in a terrific position\nto understand the month's\ntopic that follows,\nwhich is all about mental health.\nNow, I want to emphasize\nthat if you're somebody\nwho doesn't have any trouble\nseeing, hearing, tasting, smelling\nand has an excellent\nsense of interoception,\nI do believe that these episodes\nwill still be very relevant to you,\nbecause they have everything to do with\nhow you move through the world,\nhow you make sense of information,\nand how you organize your\nthoughts and your emotions.\nI also want to emphasize\nthat we're going to cover\na lot of practical tools.\nSo today's episode is going to be\nall about vision and eyesight,\na topic that's very near\nand dear to my heart,\nbecause it's the one that\nI've been focusing on\nfor well over 25 years of my career.\nBut we're not just going to get\ninto the mechanistic details\nabout how light is converted\ninto electrical potentials\nand things like that.\nWe are going to talk about practical tools\nthat you can and should use\nto help maintain the health\nof your visual system and your eyesight.\nVery often, young people\nwill say, what should I do?\nYou know, you're always talking about,\nyou know, neuroplasticity and\nhow it tapers off over time,\nbut I'm a young person, what should I do?\nYou should absolutely train\nand support your eyesight.\nIn fact, if you're a young\nperson and you see perfectly,\nor you feel as if you\nsee the world perfectly,\nyou are in the best position to bolster,\nto reinforce that visual system,\nso that you don't lose\nyour vision as you age.\nIn addition, you can\nleverage your visual system\nfor better mental and\nphysical performance,\nand we're going to talk about that.\nIf you're somebody who suffers\nfrom a clinical disorder of vision,\nyou have trouble seeing,\nor if you need corrective\nlenses in order to see,\nthis episode is definitely for you.\nAnd while of course I can't\nmake clinical diagnoses,\nI can't have a one-to-one conversation\nwith any of you in this\nformat, nor am I a clinician,\nI'm a scientist, not a physician.\nI did consult with our\nchair of ophthalmology,\nDr. Jeffrey Goldberg\nat Stanford University School of Medicine,\nas well as several other people\nto really vet the information\nand make sure that the protocols\nthat I'm describing are consistent\nwith the clinical literature.\nIf you have a severe eye problem,\nyou should be working with\na really good ophthalmologist\nand/or optometrist,\nbut certainly an an ophthalmologist\nwho's a medical doctor.\nBut I do believe that the information\nthat we're going to discuss today\nis going to be relevant to everybody\nand will set the stage for the month\non mental health and mental performance.\nSo, let's get started.\nWhen we hear the word vision,\nwe most often think about eyesight,\nor our ability to perceive\nshapes, and objects,\nand faces, and colors.\nAnd indeed, vision involves eyesight,\nour ability to see shapes,\nand objects, and faces,\nand colors, and so forth.\nHowever, our eyes are responsible\nfor much more than that,\nincluding our mood,\nour level of alertness,\nand all of that is included\nin what we call vision.\nSo I just want to take about\nthree, maybe four minutes,\nand talk about how the visual\nsystem works, how it's built,\nand how you are able to\nso-called see things around you.\nI also want to describe the ways\nin which your eyes and your visual system\nimpact your mood and\nyour level of alertness.\nAnd then, we are going to get\nright into some protocols,\nsome specific things that\neach and all of you should do\nif you want to enhance your vision\nand maintain your vision as you get older.\nAnd again, if you're a\n15-year-old or a 12-year-old,\nthis episode is especially for you,\nbecause your nervous system\nis far more plastic than mine is.\nIt's much more amenable to change,\nso you can really build a\nvery strong visual system.\nAnd in doing that,\nand if you adopt specific behaviors\nat any age of light viewing\nat particular times and particular ways,\nthen you can build an emotional system\nthat's also reinforced\nby your visual system.\nSo, let's talk about vision.\nWhat is vision?\nWell, vision starts with the eyes.\nWe have no what's called\nextraocular light perception.\nWhile it feels good to\nhave light on our skin,\nwhile it feels good to be outside\nin the sunlight for most people,\nthe only way that light information\ncan get to the cells of your body\nis through these two little goodies\non the front of your face.\nAnd for those of you listening,\nI'm just pointing to my eyes.\nAs many of you have heard me say before,\non this and other podcasts,\nyour eyes, in particular,\nyour neural retinas\nare part of your central nervous system.\nThey are part of your brain.\nThey're the only part of your brain\nthat sits outside the cranial vault.\nIn other words, you have\ntwo pieces of your brain\nthat deliberately got squeezed\nout of the skull during development\nand placed in these things\nwe call eye sockets.\nThere's a genetic program\nfor the specific purpose\nof making sure that three\nlittle layers of neurons,\nnerve cells, got squeezed out\nand form what are called\nyour neural retinas.\nNow, the eyes have a lot\nof other goodies in them\nthat are very important,\nand those are the goodies\nthat we're going to focus on a lot today.\nThere's a lens to focus light,\nprecisely to the retina.\nIf you're somebody who requires\neyeglasses or contacts,\nchances are, you don't do that correctly,\nand so, that's why you use other lenses,\nlike eyeglasses or contacts.\nThere are also other pieces of the eye\nthat are designed to\nkeep the eye lubricated.\nYou also have these things\nthat we call eyelashes.\nMost people don't know this,\nbut eyelashes are there to\ntrigger the blink reflex\nif a piece of dust or something\ngets in front of your eye.\nIt's a beautiful adaptation of nature.\nThey aren't just aesthetically nice.\nCostello happens to have\nvery long eyelashes.\nHe gets compliments\nabout this all the time.\nMaybe you have long eyelashes.\nI don't have particularly long eyelashes.\nBut the eyelashes are there,\nso that if a piece of dust or something\nstarts to head towards the cornea,\nthe eye blinks very, very fast.\nIt's the fastest reflex you\nown is your eye blink reflex.\nWe also have these things called eyelids.\nNow, eyelids might seem like\nthe most boring topic of all,\nbut they are incredibly fascinating.\nToday, we're going to talk\nabout how you can actually\nuse your visual system to\nincrease your levels of alertness\nbased on the neural circuits\nthat link your brainstem\nwith your eyelids.\nAnd no, we are not going\nto have a blinking contest,\nbecause I would win and you would lose,\nand that wouldn't be fun for you.\nSo, let's talk about what\nthe eyes do for vision.\nBasically, the entire job of the eyes\nis to collect light information\nand send it off to the rest of the brain,\nin a form that the brain can understand.\nRemember, no light actually gets in\npast those neural retinas.\nIt gets to the neural retina,\nand we have specific cells in\nthe eye called photoreceptors.\nThey come in two different\ntypes, rods and cones.\nCones are mainly responsible\nfor daytime vision,\nand the rods are mainly\nresponsible for vision at night\nor under low light conditions,\ngenerally speaking.\nSo basically what happens\nis if your eyelids are open,\nlight comes into the eye,\nthe lens focuses that light,\nlight is also just called\nphotons, light energy,\nonto the retina.\nThese photoreceptors, the rods and cones,\nhave chemical reactions inside them\nthat involve things like vitamin A\nand that chemical reaction\nconverts the light into electricity.\nNow, that might seem incredibly abstract,\nbut the way to think about\nthis is very similar to,\nfor instance, you have\ntouch receptors on your skin\nand when you press on\nthose touch receptors,\nthey convert pressure, physical pressure,\ninto electrical information\nand those neurons send it up\nto your spinal cord and brain,\nand you can register that somebody or you\nare touching the top of\nyour hand, as I'm doing now.\nWith the eyes and the retina,\nit's just that light gets converted\ninto electrical information.\nWithin the eye, within the retina,\nthere are then a series\nof stages of processing,\nand that information eventually\ngets sent into the brain\nby a very specific class of neurons.\nI would like you to know\nthe names of these neurons.\nThey're called retinal ganglion cells.\nSo the only thing you need to know\nabout the neuroscience\nof the eye at this point\nare that there are rods and cones.\nThe cones are involved\nin bright daytime vision\nand rods are involved in more\ndusk or nighttime vision.\nAnd you've got these cells\ncalled retinal ganglion cells\nthat send the information\noff to the rest of the brain.\nNow, here's what's incredible.\nI just want you to\nponder this for a second.\nThis still blows my mind.\nEverything you see around you,\nyou're not actually seeing\nthose objects directly.\nWhat you're doing is\nyou're making a best guess\nabout what's there based on\nthe pattern of electricity\nthat arrives in your brain.\nNow, that might just seem totally wild\nand hard to wrap your head around,\nbut think about it this way,\nbecause this is the way it actually works.\nLet's take an example of a\ncolor, like green or blue.\nYou have cones in your eye\nthat respond best to\nthe wavelength of light\nthat is reflected off, say, a green apple.\nSo, you don't actually\nsee the green apple.\nWhat you see is the light\nbouncing off that green apple,\nand it goes into your eye,\nand you see it and perceive\nit as round and green,\nbut not because you see anything green.\nNo green light arrives in your brain.\nWhat happens is your\nbrain actually compares\nthe amount of green reflection\ncoming off that apple\nto the amount of red and blue around it.\nWell, you might say, well, the green apple\nis sitting on a brown\ntable or a white surface.\nWell, then, it will appear very green.\nBecause the amount of wavelength of light\nfor green is very high,\nand the amount for red is very low,\nand so, it looks very green, okay?\nSo, we don't actually\nsee anything directly.\nWhat the brain is receiving\nis a series of signals,\nelectrical signals, and it's\ncomparing electrical signals,\nin order to come up with what\nwe call these perceptions.\nLike I see something green,\na green apple, or I see red.\nLet me give you a slightly\ndifferent example.\nIf you were to play a key on the piano,\nlet's say you play, I'm not a musician,\nbut I'm going to, so hopefully\nI won't get this too incorrectly\nbut let's say you have like E sharp,\nand maybe it's like ding,\nding, ding, ding, ding.\nIf the brain gets that signal,\nit doesn't actually know E that's what,\nit doesn't recognize it\nuntil you were to play\nanother key next to it,\ndun, dun, dun, dun,\nand what it does, it does the math,\nit does the subtraction,\nand it compares those two.\nSo when we see something green,\nor we see something red,\nor we see something blue,\nwe're not actually seeing it directly.\nThe brain is making a guess about\nhow green or red or blue that thing is\nby comparing what's around it, okay?\nAnd if that seems hard\nto wrap your head around,\ndon't worry, because we will explain it\nin more depth going forward.\nBut I really want people\nto understand this,\nthat vision, eyesight, is not\nlooking at things directly,\nand that information getting\ndirectly into your brain,\nit is translated.\nLight information is transformed\ninto electrical signals\nthat your visual system\nexquisitely understands.\nNow, what does this mean?\nWhy should you care about this?\nWell, if you have a dog\nlike I do, or a cat,\nthey are not colorblind,\nbut they lack the cones\nthat respond to red,\nmeaning long wavelength light.\nSo what does that mean?\nThat means that when they see green,\nit's different than the green you see.\nNot because that apple\nis invisible to them,\nbut because they aren't\nable to compare it to red,\nand you are.\nAs a consequence, when\nthey look at a green lawn,\nit looks more brownish or orange to them.\nWhen you wear a red shirt\nin front of your dog or cat,\nif you see a stop sign\nand they see a stop sign,\nthey see orangish-brown, and you see red.\npresuming that you are a trichromat,\nmeaning you have three-color vision.\nSo, this is all to say that every animal\nsees the world differently,\ndepending on whether or not they have\none or two or three of\nthese different cones,\nthe red, blue, or green cones.\nIf you are a mantis shrimp of all things,\nyou see hundreds of colors\nthat human beings can't see, okay?\nMany things animals see into visual ranges\nthat you and I can't see in.\nSo for instance, a pit\nviper senses heat emissions,\nit literally sees the\nheat coming off of you\nor of an animal that they want to eat.\nIf you are a ground squirrel,\nyou can see ultraviolet light.\nThis is going to sound kind of weird,\nbut ground squirrels\nactually signal one another\nby standing up outside\nand shining sunlight\noff each other's stomachs to each other,\nsignaling at a distance,\njust like, you know,\nyou could signal somebody with a mirror\nin sunlight at distance.\nThere are species of primates,\nthis isn't very pleasant to think about,\nthat urinate on their hands,\nand then wipe it all over their stomach.\nand then use that sunlight\nto reflect different\nsignals to each other.\nI don't know what they're saying.\nWe always assume it's\nsomething cute and nice,\nbut maybe they're insulting each other.\nSo this actually gets right down\nto the heart of these bigger questions,\nlike consciousness, what do we see?\nWhat's out there?\nHow much of life is\nreally accessible to us?\nAnd I could go on and on, you know,\nthis used to be kind\nof an obsession of mine\nwhen I was coming up in the\nfield of visual neuroscience\nto understand how different\nanimals see the world\ncompared to us.\nYou know, I'll give one\nmore example, a diving bird,\nyou know, a bird that\nflies over the ocean.\nIt has an incredible task.\nIt has to both view the horizon,\nand it has to view schools of fish,\nand then, it has to make a trajectory\ndown into the water and grab\none of those fish to eat.\nAnd the water has what's\ncalled a refractory index.\nIt actually shifts like a prism,\nthe impression or the perception\nof where that fish is, right?\nIf the bird sees the fish\nright below it, it has to know,\nit has to adjust its diving\ntrajectory just right,\nbecause it knows that that fish\nactually isn't where it sees it.\nIt's probably a few inches\nahead or to the side of that,\nbecause of the way that\nwater diverts the image.\nIf you've ever dropped a\ncoin to the bottom of a pool,\nif you go straight down\nlooking at that location.\nIf you were to look from\nthe top of the pool,\nand you dive straight down\nwith your eyes closed,\nyou will miss, because the water refracts,\nit shifts the visual image.\nWell, diving birds have an arrangement\nof these retinal cells that\ncommunicate to the brain\nthat's both a streak to view the horizon,\n'cause they need to know where they are\nrelative to the horizon,\nand they have a pupil like we\ndo on the bottom of their eye,\nso that they can make very\naccurate dive and attacks\non these schools of fish,\nand catch fish, and eat those fish.\nWe just have pupils in\nthe middle of our eyes.\nSo there's a ton about\nthe optics of the eye,\nand the way that it\ncommunicates with the brain\nthat allows us to see.\nWe could spend hours talking about this,\nbut what I'd like to embed in your mind\nis that what you experience\nin the outside world\nis bottlenecked, it's\nlimited by which wavelengths,\nwhich colors if you will,\nof light that you can see.\nThat your brain is coming up\nwith a best guess about what's there.\nIt doesn't actually know what's there.\nAnd that your vision\nis distinctly different\nfrom say, the vision of a dog\nor from the vision of\nsomebody who's a dichromat,\nmeaning they don't have a red cone.\nA lot of people, in particular\nabout 1 in 80 males,\nlacks a red cone and\ntherefore, sees the world\nmuch the same way that Costello does.\nAlthough, he sees it from just\nmuch lower toward the ground.\nSo, that's what I'd like you to understand\nabout the way the eye\ncommunicates with the brain.\nI would also like you to understand\nthat the brain itself\nis making these guesses\nand that those guesses are largely right.\nHow do I know that?\nWell, they're right\nbecause when you reach out\nto grab a glass, most of\nthe time you grab the glass,\nand you don't miss, right?\nMost of the time, when you make judgments\nabout the world around you,\nbased on your visual impression of them,\nit allows you to move\nfunctionally through the world.\nBut let me give you some examples\nof where this guessing\nis happening right now.\nAnd it's so incredible that, to this day,\nthis still blows my mind.\nCover one eye with one hand.\nIf you're driving, maybe don't do this.\nIf you're viewing the world around you,\npresumably you can see\neverything that's out there.\nI could do this with one\neye or the other eye.\nYou probably see better\nout of one or the other,\nand we'll talk about that.\nYou have a giant blind spot\nin the middle of your visual field.\nIt's called your blind spot.\nIt is the spot in which\nthe connections, the wires,\nfrom all those retinal ganglion cells\nexit the back of the eye and\nhead off toward the brain.\nIn other words, you are\nblind for a huge spot\nof your central vision.\nThe part of your vision\nthat's highest acuity, highest detail,\nand yet, you don't see that ever.\nYou cover one eye, and\nyou see perfectly fine.\nAnd it's not just because your eye\nis moving around really quickly.\nYour brain is guessing\nwhat's in that spot,\nwhich is absolutely incredible,\nand so, you don't see that blind spot.\nThis is happening all the time.\nNow, when you have two eyes open,\nthe way that your eyes are\npositioned in your head\nand the way they view the world is such\nthat they fill in each\nother's blind spots,\nso it's pretty convenient.\nBut if you cover one\neye, that's impossible,\nand yet, you still see\nthe world as complete.\nSo the brain is doing\nthese incredible things.\nIt's also creating\ndepth, a sense of depth.\nEven though what arrives from the retina\nis essentially a readout of a\ntwo-dimensional, flat image,\nso it can sense depth.\nHow do you know depth?\nWell, this is very simple.\nThings that are closer\nto you tend to be larger\nthan things that are far away.\nThings that are closer to you\ntend to look like they're moving faster.\nIf you've ever been in a train\nand you look to your side,\nthe rungs on a fence, or the\ntrain tracks going by you,\nlook like they're going very fast.\nIf you look off in the distance,\nthey look like they're moving very slowly.\nAnd there are differences\nbetween what's close to you\nand what's further away.\nSo, a little house on the horizon,\nyou don't look at it and say,\noh, that must be a tiny, little house.\nYou have some prior knowledge\nthat things further away are smaller.\nSo that's the main way that you do that.\nAnd you compare the location,\nat which information about\nlight lands on the two eyes.\nSo your eyes are slightly\noffset from one another.\nSo that, for instance, if I look at you,\nif you were standing right\nin front of me right now,\nand I were to look at you,\nthe image of your face,\nthe light bouncing off your\nface to be more precise,\nlands on one eye in a\nslightly different location\nthan it does in the other eye,\nand then the brain does math.\nIt basically does the equivalent\nof geometry and trigonometry,\nand essentially figures out\nhow far away you are from me,\nwhich is just incredible.\nSo the brain does all\nthis very, very fast,\nand the brain uses about 40 to 50%\nof its total real estate for vision.\nThat's how important vision is.\nNow, for those of you that are blind,\nor low vision, or no vision,\nthat real estate in the brain\nwill be taken over by neurons\nthat control sense of touch\nand a sense of hearing,\nand your, indeed, hearing\nand touch are much better,\nhigher acuity, and faster in blind people.\nBut for most of you, who\nI presume are sighted,\nthis is how it works.\nSo, that's kind of vision from\neye to brain in a nutshell.\nThere are a bunch of different stations\nin the brain that do different things.\nThat's eyesight.\nNow, I want to talk about\nthe other aspect of vision,\nwhich is the stuff that\nyou don't perceive,\nthe subconscious stuff.\nAnd then, we'll transition directly\ninto how you can use light and eyesight\nto control this other stuff\nbecause it's very important\nand that other stuff is\nmood, sleep, and appetite.\nAnd there are ways in which\nyou can use the same protocols\nthat I will describe,\nin order to preserve and\neven enhance your vision,\nyour ability to see things\nand consciously perceive them.\nSo the protocols we will describe\nhave a lot of carry over\nto both conscious eyesight\nand to these subconscious\naspects of vision.\nAnd I just want you to\nunderstand a little bit more\nabout the science of seeing,\nof eyesight and vision,\nand then all the protocols\nwill make perfect sense.\nSo as amazing as eyesight is,\nit actually did not evolve for us\nto see shapes and colors\nand motion and form.\nThe most ancient cells in our eyes,\nand the reason we have eyes,\nis to communicate information\nabout time of day to the\nrest of the brain and body.\nRemember, there's no\nextraocular photo reception.\nThere's no way for light information\nto get to all the cells of your body,\nbut every cell in your body needs to know\nif it's night or day.\nAnd I talked a little bit about this\non the, in the episodes on sleep,\nand this episode is not about sleep.\nBut I want to emphasize that\nthere is a particular category\nof retinal ganglion cell,\nremember the neurons that\nconnect the retina to the brain,\nthat is involved in a\nspecial kind of vision\nthat has nothing to do\nwith conscious perception\nof what's around you,\nand it's happening right now,\nit's happening all the time.\nThese are so-called melanopsin\nretinal ganglion cells,\nnamed after the opsin that\nthey contain within them.\nThey are essentially photoreceptors,\nremember before I said\nthere are photoreceptors\nand then these ganglion cells?\nWell, these melanopsin\ncells, as the name suggests,\nmelanopsin, have their own\nphotoreceptor built inside them.\nThe opsin that they contain\nis actually very similar to the melanopsin\nthat is present in the\nskin of some amphibians\nand that causes those amphibians\nto change their skin color\nin different light conditions.\nSo you have, believe it or not,\na little bit of frog skin\nin your eye, so to speak.\nOkay, not exactly, but you\nessentially have the equivalent\nof what frogs have on\ntheir skin in your eye.\nIf you are low vision or no vision,\nas long as you have retinas,\nit's very likely you\nstill have these cells,\neven though you can't see\nor you don't see well.\nThese cells, retinal ganglion cells,\ncommunicate to areas of the brain\nwhen particular qualities of light\nare present in your environment\nand signal to the brain,\ntherefore, that it's early\nday or late in the day.\nThese melanopsin ganglion cells\nare sometimes also called\nintrinsically photosensitive cells\nbecause they behave like photoreceptors.\nWhat do these cells respond to,\nand why should you care about them?\nWell, you should care about them,\nbecause they regulate\nwhen you'll get sleepy,\nwhen you'll feel awake, how\nfast your metabolism is,\nexcuse me, your blood sugar levels,\nyour dopamine levels,\nand your pain threshold.\nThere are other factors\nthat impact those things,\nbut they are one of the,\nif not the most powerful determinant,\nof those other things like\nmood and pain threshold,\nsleepiness, wakefulness, et cetera.\nThese melanopsin ganglion cells\nhave been shown by the\nNitz Group, N-I-T-Z,\nup at University of Washington,\nand by Samer Hattar's lab\nand David Burson's lab,\nand a number of other people's labs,\nSatchin Panda, Prevencio, et cetera,\na number of excellent labs in neuroscience\nto set the circadian clock\nand to respond best to the contrast\nbetween blue and yellow light\nof the sort that lands on the\ncells when you view the sun,\nwhen it's a so-called low solar angle,\nwhen it's low in the sky,\neither in the morning or in the evening,\nwhat does all this mean?\nIt means, and here's the first protocol,\nand you've probably\nheard me say this before,\nbut is appropriate to this\nepisode to say it again.\nIf you are not viewing the sun, sunlight,\neven through cloud cover,\nfor two to 10 minutes in\nthe early part of the day,\nwhen the sun is still low in the sky\nand doing the same thing\nagain in the evening,\nyou are severely disrupting\nyour sleep rhythms,\nyour mood, your hormones, your metabolism,\nyour pain threshold,\nand many other factors,\nincluding your ability to\nlearn and remember information.\nThe most central and important\naspect of our biology,\nand perhaps our psychology as well,\nis to anchor ourselves in\ntime, to know when we exist.\nOkay, it sounds a little bit\nabstract and philosophical,\nbut it's not.\nAnd we don't know time as a real thing\nbecause of watches and clocks.\nWe know time at a biological level,\nbased on where the sun is and where,\nwhich of course is where\nwe are relative to the sun,\nbecause the earth is spinning around.\nNow, what does this mean for a protocol?\nIt means, see, get that light\nin your eyes early in the day,\nand anytime you want to be awake.\nSo try and get as much sunlight\nin your eyes during the\nday as you safely can.\nWe'll talk about eye safety\nthis episode in depth.\nAnd the blue light and the\ncontrast of that blue yellow,\nremember we don't see blue,\nthis is all subconscious.\nThis is blue reflections\ncoming off of sunlight.\nBlue light, we've been\ntold is so terrible for us,\nit is absolutely essential and wonderful\nfor waking up the brain,\nfor triggering all sorts of\npositive biological reactions,\nbut it needs to be\nviewed early in the day.\nIf you can't see sunlight,\nbecause it's the thick\ncloud cover of say a,\nyou know, you're in\nthe UK and it's winter,\nthen artificial lights,\nespecially blue lights,\nwould be very beneficial to you.\nWe need a lot of this light\nand its contrast with yellow,\nin order to trigger\nthese melanopsin cells,\nwhich will then trigger\nyour circadian clock,\nwhich sits above the roof of your mouth,\nwhich will signal every cell in your body,\nincluding temperature, rhythms, et cetera.\nSo first things first, your visual system\nwas not for seeing\nfaces, motion, et cetera.\nThe most ancient cells in your eye,\nwhich are there right now as we speak,\nare there to inform your body\nand brain about time of day,\nso you want to get that\nbright light early in the day.\nAbsolutely essential, two to 10 minutes,\nyou can download the light meter app\nif you want to measure lux.\nWhen we, when I explained how\nto do that in earlier episodes\nit got a little convoluted,\nget that two to 10 minutes,\nideally without sunglasses.\nNow, here's another reason to do this,\nand I've never spoken about\nthis before on any podcast,\nwhich is that there have\nbeen several studies now\nin thousands of subjects,\nexploring what can be done\nto prevent myopia, nearsightedness,\nand other visual defects.\nAnd it turns out, in a series\nof large clinical trials,\nthe conclusion has emerged\nthat getting two hours a day\nof outdoor time without sunglasses,\nblue light, this blue light\nthat everyone has demonized,\ngetting that sunlight during\nthe day for two hours,\neven if you're reading other things,\nand doing other things outside,\nhas a significant effect\non reducing the probability\nthat you will get myopia, nearsightedness.\nNow, whether or not that's also due\nto the fact that myopia can be caused\nby viewing things up close to too much.\nSo if you're indoors,\nwe tend to be looking at\nthings more closely, right?\nUnless you have a very large house\nwith walls that are\nvery far away from you,\nbut the effect does seem\nto be directly related\nto getting sunlight,\nand not just to the distance\nthat you're viewing.\nI'm going to describe\nthis study just briefly,\nbut this is a second protocol.\nSo we have one protocol\nabout getting sunlight\nto set your circadian\nclocks, meaning wake you up,\nestablish your sleep, will occur\nabout 12 to 16 hours later,\nthat's all in the sleep episode.\nBut also to enhance your mood,\nto enhance your metabolism,\nto optimize your hormone levels,\nand to optimize learning\nand dopamine levels,\nthis feel good neuromodulator\nthat's essential to not\ngetting depressed, et cetera.\nBut now's the second protocol,\nwhich is ideally, and\nthis includes children,\nas long as they're not very small infants,\nideally, we're all getting\ntwo hours of outdoor time,\neven if there's cloud cover.\nRemember, we evolved mostly\nunder outdoor conditions,\nnot indoor conditions,\nand no artificial blue light\nwill not replace this\naspect of your visual system\nand offsetting myopia.\nSo I just want to briefly\ndescribe this study,\nbecause it's a very important one,\nand I don't think it's\ndiscussed often enough.\nThere are many studies exploring this,\nbut one of the ones I liked the most,\nlooked at 693 students,\nand a subset of them were encouraged\nto spend 11 hours a week outdoors.\nOkay, so most kids are in\nschool five days a week or so,\nso they're spending 11\nhours a week outdoors.\nThey are sometimes reading outdoors.\nThey're not always just playing outdoors,\nthey might be reading books, et cetera.\nThey used eight different schools.\nAnd the reason they did the study,\nI probably should have mentioned,\nis that myopia, nearsightedness,\nis a global epidemic.\nAt least, that's how it was\nreferred to in the study.\nI don't know who decides\nwhat's an epidemic or not.\nI think there are thresholds for that.\nThis paper published in the\njournal Ophthalmology in 2018\ndescribed the fact that being\noutdoors for two hours a day\ncould significantly reduce the probability\nthat these children would\ndevelop nearsightedness.\nAnd it turns out based on other studies,\nthat adults who spend\ntwo hours a day outside,\nthat would be reading\noutside, talking outside.\nNo, it does not include light\ncoming through the windshield of your car,\nI'll explain why in a few moments,\noffset the formation of myopia.\nNow, myopia, or nearsightedness,\nhas to do with the way that the lens\nfocuses light onto the retina.\nI don't want to get into a\nlong description of this now,\nbut basically the lens has\nbring light to the retina,\nnot in front of it, not behind it.\nIf it brings light to a\nposition in front of the retina,\nthen you won't see clearly, you\nwill need corrective lenses.\nIf it brings light directly to the retina,\nthen you will see clearly,\nthat should be intuitive why\nthat makes, why it makes sense.\nSo you might say, well,\nwhy would being outside,\ngetting this blue light\nor this blue-yellow contrast from sunlight\nactually offset myopia?\nWell, it probably, and I\nwant to emphasize probably\nhas to do with the fact\nthat these melanopsin ganglion cells,\nthese intrinsically\nphotosensitive ganglion cells,\nare not just responsible for sleep,\nand talking to your circadian\nclock, and that sort of thing,\nthey also make connections\nwithin the retina.\nThey connect to things like,\nthis is for the aficionados,\nthe ciliary body, the iris,\nthe muscles and the\nstructures within the eye\nthat actually move the lens\nand allow you to adjust your vision\nto things up close or far away.\nAnd in doing so, they\nincrease or improve the health\nof the little tiny muscles within the eye\nthat move the lens.\nAnd they probably, again, this\nneeds a little bit more work,\nin order to really tamp\ndown the mechanism.\nThey're probably also involved\nin bringing growth\nfactors and blood supply\nto the muscles and to the\nneurons that are responsible\nfor this focusing\nmechanism within the eye.\nSo remember, your eye\nis an optical device.\nYou were born with lenses,\nyou don't have to use glasses,\nor maybe you do because you\nhave lenses in your eyes\nand those lenses need to move.\nIt's not a rigid lens, like a glass lens.\nIt's a dynamic lens,\nand it has little muscles that pull on it,\nand squeeze it, and make\nit thicker or thinner,\nas you look at things close and far away,\nand I'll describe how\nthat works in a moment.\nThese melanopsin cells and\ntheir activation by sunlight,\ncompletely subconsciously,\nunaware, you're unaware of this,\npromote the health of\nthis system within the eye\nand allow you to offset the\nmyopia, nearsightedness.\nIn other words, getting\noutside for two hours a day,\neach day, on average, even\nif there's cloud cover,\nwithout sunglasses on,\nwill allow you to offset\nthe formation of myopia.\nNow, you might still form myopia\nif you have certain structural features\nor a genetic basis for that,\nwe will talk about things\nthat you can do as well.\nBut for everybody, we\nshould be doing this.\nAnd that might seem like a lot,\nbut this is the way that\nyour visual system works.\nStaying indoors, just\ngetting artificial light,\nand looking at things up\nclose leads to visual defects.\nOkay, it's a form of kind of\nlike visual obesity, right?\nThe posture of your visual\nsystem, if you will,\nis going to be unhealthy\nif you're just indoors\nand you're not getting\nsunlight early in the day\nand for at least two hours per day.\nI want to talk a little bit\nmore about how our eyes adjust\nto things that are\nclose to us or far away.\nThis is an absolutely\nbrilliant consequence\nof our nature and our design.\nAnd whenever I say nature and design,\npeople always ask me, you know,\nwhat are you really trying to say?\nAre you trying to talk about creators?\nAre you talking about intelligent design?\nLook, I want to be very frank with you.\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase,\nand neither were you.\nAnd so, that is all very interesting,\nbut it's not the topic of this discussion.\nWhat is clear and what is\nthe topic of this discussion\nis that the eye can dynamically adjust\nwhere light lands by moving the lens\nand changing the shape\nof the lens in your eye,\nthrough a process called accommodation.\nAnd if you understand this\nprocess of accommodation,\nyou not only can enhance\nthe health of your eyes\nin the immediate and long-term,\nbut you also can work better.\nYou'll be able to focus better\non physical and mental work.\nYou will be able to\nconcentrate for longer.\nAnd I want to emphasize that\nso much of our mental focus,\nwhether or not it's\nfor cognitive endeavors\nor physical endeavors,\nis grounded in where we\nplace our visual focus, okay?\nWhat we look at and our ability\nto hold our concentration there\nis critically determining how we think.\nSo, in other words, if\nyou can hold visual focus,\nyou can hold mental\nfocus, cognitive focus,\nbut holding visual focus is\nchallenging, it's tiring,\nbecause it requires movement of the lens.\nAnd that movement of the lens\nrequires activation of muscles.\nAnd the activation of muscles,\nas you know from the physical\nperformance episodes,\nif you saw them and even if you don't,\nis dictated by neurons.\nSo, what is accommodation?\nWell, it's actually very\nsimple and very elegant.\nAnd again, this is another case where\nwhenever I look at this stuff,\neven though I've been\nlooking at for years,\nlearning about it for years,\nit still boggles my mind\nthat we have these apparati\nbuilt into our eyes.\nSo, we have lenses in our eyes,\nand we have these things\ncalled the irises.\nYou know, you're all\nfamiliar with the iris,\nbecause you'll see people's\npupils get bigger or smaller,\nand we intuitively think of\neyes as having the pupils.\nIf you actually draw two\ncircles on a sheet of paper,\nand you just, they look like two circles.\nBut if you put little dots\nin the middle of them,\nthey look like eyes.\nYour brain recognizes those as eyes,\nbecause one of the first things you see\nwhen you come into this world are eyes.\nAnd actually, if you put the\nlittle dots close together,\nit'll look kind of wrong,\nlike it's cross-eyed.\nAnd if you put them at different locations\nwithin those two dots,\nof opposing locations,\nit'll look google-eyed.\nAnd so, your brain is actually filling in\nall the face and other information,\neven emotional information,\njust based on this recognition of eyes.\nAnd so, there's clearly we know this,\nthere's real estate deep up in,\nyou know, further up in the brain,\nthat's responsible for\nanalyzing and recognizing faces\nand the eyes and the position\nof these little things we call irises,\nand pupils, et cetera, is really important\nfor how we interpret the status of others.\nAnd that's why it's such a powerful thing\njust to put two circles and, you know,\nmove the pupils around on paper.\nIn fact, I want to get into accommodation,\nbut if you think about it,\nif one of my pupils was up there\nand the other one was down there,\none was really big, and\none was really small,\nthat would actually be a\nsign of pretty severe damage.\nIf someone gets hit hard\non the side of the head,\nyou'll notice that they\nshine a light in one eye.\nYou know why they're doing that?\nThey're actually looking at the other eye.\nWhen you shine light of the\neye that pupil constricts\nto limit the amount of\nlight that comes in,\nso it doesn't damage the eye.\nThis also happens when you\nwalk outside, and it's bright,\nit constricts, but we have what's called\nthe consensual pupil reflex.\nThere's a connection\ndeep in the brainstem,\ndeep back here in the brain near my neck,\nthat connects the pupil\nmechanism for the two eyes,\nand they're looking at the other eye.\nAnd if you shine light in one eye,\nand that people constricts\nbut the other one doesn't,\nthere's a good chance\nthere's brainstem damage.\nThis is what they do on the side\nof a, you know, football\nfield or a boxing match,\nor if someone unfortunately\nhits their head.\nSo, two pupils and don't\nfreak out if one pupil\nis a little bit smaller than the other,\nthat doesn't necessarily\nmean brain damage.\nBut if you suddenly have one\npupil bigger than the other,\nyou absolutely want to go\nsee a neurologist right away.\nSo, the eyes and the pupils\nare indicative of things\nthat are happening deep in the brain.\nNow, accommodation is our\nability to accommodate\nto things that are up\nclose here or further away.\nAnd the way this works is that the iris,\nand the musculature, and a structure\ncalled the ciliary body move the lens.\nSo, when you look far away,\nokay, when you see things far away,\nyour lens actually relaxes,\nit can flatten out.\nSo I want you to think about this.\nWhen you look far away,\nwhen it may be anywhere from\nlike 20 feet away from you\nout to a horizon that's miles\nor kilometers away from you,\nthe lens can just relax.\nIt can flatten out.\nAnd you'll notice that\nit actually is relaxing\nto look at a horizon.\nIt's relaxing to look far away.\nWhereas if I look at\nsomething up close to me\nlike this pen, or my phone,\nor a computer screen,\nor this microphone, it takes effort.\nYou'll sense the effort.\nNow, some of that effort\nis actually eye movements,\nbecause you have muscles\nthat can move your eyes\nwithin their sockets.\nBut a lot of the work, quote unquote,\nis neural work of the muscles\nhaving to move and contract,\nsuch that the lens actually gets thicker,\nin order to bring the light to the retina\nand not to a location in\nfront of it or behind it,\nso called accommodation.\nThere's also changes in\nthe size of the pupil,\nas things are closer and\nfurther away from you.\nIn fact, there's a simple\nway to think about this.\nHealthy pupils are going to dilate\nwhen you look at something\nfar away from you.\nNow, when you see\nsomething that excites you\nor stresses you out,\nyour pupils also get big.\nYour eyes get wide.\nBut if you look at something far away,\nyour pupils are going to dilate.\nAnd when you look at things\nthat are closer to you,\nwhen you move them up close,\nthe pupils are going to shrink.\nThat's all part of this\naccommodation mechanism.\nNow, you might say,\nwhy are you telling me\nabout accommodation?\nThis is crazy.\nWhy are you telling me about this?\nWell, these days we're\nspending a lot of time\nlooking at things, mainly\nour phones up close,\nand computers up close,\nand we are indoors.\nIf you are a young person, and\neven if you are 25 or older,\nand you are spending a lot of time\nlooking at things up close,\nand you are not allowing\nyour vision to relax.\nIn other words, you are\nnot giving your lens\nthe opportunity to flatten out,\nand for these muscles to\nrelieve themselves of this work,\nyou may or may not have\nmigraine headaches.\nYou may or may not have headaches.\nYou might, and that could\nbe the cause of those.\nBut you are also training your eyes\nto be good at looking at things\nup close and not far away,\nand as a consequence,\nyou are reshaping the neural\ncircuitry in your brain,\nand it is not good.\nIt is not healthy to only\nlook at things up close.\nNow, there are a lot of\nrecommendations out there right now,\nespecially with all the lockdowns\nof the last, you know, 12 to 18 months\nthat people should look up from\nZoom every once in a while.\nOr maybe now, I'm hearing\nthat people should take calls\ninstead of doing Zoom,\nwhere you should look up\nfrom your computer screen.\nIt's actually not going\nto solve the problem,\njust to look up from your computer screen.\nYou need to go to a window.\nYou need to look out at a distance.\nIdeally, you would even open the window,\nbecause those windows actually filter out\na lot of the blue light that\nyou want during the daytime.\nA lot of the sunlight,\nit's actually 50 times less gets through.\nYou want to get out onto a balcony.\nYou want to relax your eyes\nand look out at the horizon.\nYou want to go into what's\ncalled panoramic vision,\nand let your vision expand.\nYou want this lens mechanism\nto be very elastic.\nYou don't want it to get stuck\nin that configuration of\nlooking at things up close.\nAccommodation is a wonderful\nfeature of your visual system,\nbut you don't want to push that too hard,\ntoo often, or for too long.\nYou want to view the horizon.\nYou want to get outside,\nnot just to lighten the load on your mind,\nor to think about other things,\nbut to maintain the health\nof your visual system.\nIn other words, you want\nto exercise these muscles\nand that involves both the lens moving\nand getting kind of thicker\nand relaxing that lens.\nAnd the relaxation of the lens\nis actually one of the\nbest things you can do\nfor the musculature of the inner eye.\nSo what's the protocol, how\noften should you do this?\nYou might be surprised,\nbut for every 30 minutes of focused work,\nyou probably want to look\nup every once in a while\nand just try and relax\nyour face and eye muscles,\nincluding your jaw muscles,\nbecause all these things are\nclosely linked in the brainstem\nand allow your eyes to go into\na so-called panoramic vision,\nwhere you're just not\nreally focusing on anything\nand then refocus on your work.\nAt least every 90 minutes of\nlooking at things up close,\nor even if you're looking at a screen,\nyou know, television screen,\nor you're watching a\nmovie, or you're indoors,\nfor every 90 minutes of that,\nyou ideally would have at least 20,\nprobably more like 30 minutes\nof being outside, ideally.\nBut if you can't be outside,\nof non up-close vision.\nAnd you might say, that's impossible,\nhow am I supposed to do that?\nYou know, I'm in an office\nor I'm in a building.\nGet to a window, get outside\nif you can do it safely,\nget onto a balcony, and\njust let your eyes relax.\nMany people are experiencing\nsevere vision problems,\nbecause they're not getting\nenough sunlight during the day.\nThey have sleep problems,\nbecause they're not viewing\nsunlight early in the day.\nAnd as I've mentioned\nin previous episodes,\nthey're getting a lot of\nartificial stimulation,\nartificial light stimulation,\nof the eye in the middle of the night,\nall of this is through the visual system.\nSo migraines, fatigue,\nchallenges with your eyesight\ngetting worse as you age,\nor even in young people, there's a,\nyou know, at least\naccording to the articles,\nthey describe it as\nthis epidemic of myopia\ncan largely be dealt\nwith by getting outside,\ngoing into panoramic vision,\nexperiencing some distanced vision,\nlook at things off in the horizon.\nIf you're walking or hiking or biking,\nnot looking at your phone the whole time\nthat you're doing that.\nIf you're at the bus\nstop or you're commuting,\ncertainly not looking at your phone\nthe entire time you're doing that.\nSo this is vital.\nAnd I want to emphasize another protocol,\nthough I don't want to get\ninto it in too much depth,\n'cause I want to make sure\nthat I also talk about a number\nof other important aspects\nof the visual system that\nare more related to sight,\nbut getting into optic\nflow is very important\nfor de-stressing your system.\nWhen you move through space,\nwhether or not it's through\nwalking, biking, even swimming,\nif it's self-generated optic flow,\nso probably not driving or motorcycling,\nbut yes, bicycling or I\ndon't know, unicycling.\nI don't know why I\nthought about unicycling.\nThere used to be a graduate\nstudent at Stanford\nwho was a really impressive unicycler,\nthose are pretty rare.\nAs long as it's self-generated optic flow,\nmeaning you're generating\nmotion of your body\nand the visual images around you\nare passing by on your eyes,\nthat is very good for the visual system.\nAnd it's very good for the mood systems\nand the neuromodulator\nsystems of the brain and body\nthat regulate mood.\nThis is well-established.\nSo I'm not telling people to get away\nfrom their phone and their computers.\nI spend a lot of time staring at a page,\ndrawing, writing, texting,\net cetera, just like you do,\nbut we're really talking about\nsome very simple protocols\nthat aren't just designed\nto improve your sleep,\nbut are really designed to\nbolster and enhance your vision.\nAnd of course, because it's this podcast,\nwe will also talk about things\nthat you can take to improve your vision.\nBut if your visual behavior isn't right,\nand I do believe we should\nalways start with behaviors,\nand then think about nutrition,\nsupplementation, et cetera,\nif your behaviors around\nvision aren't right,\nyou cannot expect to have\ngood, healthy eyesight\nfor a long time, meaning\nthroughout your lifespan.\nAnd if your vision is already poor,\nmany of these things that\nI'm talking about today,\nperhaps all of them,\nwill improve your vision to some degree.\nAnd if your vision is starting to go,\nthen doing these behaviors\nis likely to really enhance\nthe quality of the vision\nthat you will build\nand maintain over time.\nAnd all of these are\nessentially zero cost, okay?\nIf you live in a very dark environment,\nlike a cave or outer space,\nit's going to be hard to\ndo some of this stuff.\nBut if you're on planet earth,\neven if there's cloud cover,\nchances are you can do some, or most,\nor even all of these\nsome, most, or all days.\nWhat I'm about to describe next\nis going to seem so\nsilly on the face of it,\nbut has deep mechanism to support it.\nPut simply, when you get\ntired, your eyelids close,\nand when you're alert,\nyour eyelids are open.\nThat is because you have\nneurons in your brain,\nthat depending on your level of alertness,\nwill make it easy or hard\nto keep your eyes open.\nNow, that's a complete duh,\nexcept that we don't often\nthink about the relationship\nbetween alertness and where we\nare looking and our eyelids.\nNow, I learned this from a\ncolleague of mine in psychiatry,\nwho happens to work on hypnosis.\nI'm not going to hypnotize you right now.\nThat's actually for a future episode.\nBut what happens when we get tired?\nOur eyelids close, and\nour chin moves down.\nWe tend to nod out this way.\nIf you have ever been in a classroom,\ncertainly not one of mine,\nbut if you've been in a classroom\nand the lecturer is kind of drawing on,\nor it's the afternoon,\nwhat you'll notice is\nthat a number of students,\ntheir heads are jolt, kind\nof their eyelids are closing,\nand their chin is dropping, and they,\nyou'll see a bunch of heads\nbouncing back up, right?\nI was definitely one of\nthose people in class.\nIf it was post-lunch in the afternoon,\nit's warm, the hum of the air conditioner,\nor whatever it is, and I'm just out, okay?\nWhen we're wide awake,\nthe opposite happens.\nOur eyelids are open all the way,\nand our chin happens to be up.\nAnd no, this is not me telling\nyou to have good posture.\nHowever, what I learned from\nmy colleague at Stanford\nis that these circuits\nactually act in loops.\nWhen we look up, maybe it's\nbecause these melanopsin cells\nare in the bottom of our retina, they are,\nand maybe it's because they're there\nin order to view sunlight,\nwhich is overhead, which it is,\nbut that system of alertness\nis linked to the position of our eyes.\nSo when we look up and our eyelids are up,\nit actually has a purpose.\nIt actually creates a\nwakefulness signal for the brain.\nAnd so, while this might seem like\nthe silliest and simple tool\nthat I might ever\ndescribe on this podcast,\nif you are feeling tired, it\nactually can be beneficial\nto the wakefulness systems of the brain,\nincluding the locus coeruleus\nand these areas that\nrelease norepinephrine\nto actually look up,\nto actually look up toward the ceiling.\nYou don't want your chin all the way back,\nbut to look up and to raise\nyour eyes toward the ceiling\nand to look up and try and\nhold that for 10 to 15 seconds.\nSo this isn't looking up\nand closing your eyes,\nlike on a nice sunny day, that's relaxing.\nThis is looking up and actually\nlooking up at the ceiling.\nIt actually triggers some\nof the areas of the brain\nthat are involved in wakefulness.\nSo if you're somebody who's\nfalling asleep at your work,\nthis can be very beneficial.\nLikewise, many people are\nlooking at their phone all day,\nand their chin is down,\nand then they're sitting at a computer\nthat's positioned below them,\nand they're having trouble\nstaying awake or focusing.\nIt can be very, I tell\nCostello this all the time,\n'cause he's always falling asleep\nwhile he's trying to do his work,\npositioning your computer\nscreen up at eye level,\nor sometimes having it\nactually above eye level,\ncan actually create\nwakefulness and alertness\nfor the work that you're going to do.\nThis is simply because of this connection\nbetween the brainstem circuits\nand the other neural circuits\nthat control wakefulness\nand eyelids opening and looking up.\nOkay, so it, again,\nit's remarkably simple,\nalmost laughably simple, but it's grounded\nin some of the most hardwired,\nmeaning present from birth,\naspects of our neural circuitry.\nAnd norepinephrine released\nfrom locus coeruleus\nisn't just a mouthful,\nit's a really interesting\nand powerful mechanism\nfor how the rest of the brain wakes up.\nLocus coeruleus hoses\nthe rest of your brain\nwith norepinephrine, in order\nto wake up those circuits\nfor work and attention.\nAnd so, eyes up is actually a way,\na route into increased alertness.\nEyes down is a route into sleepiness,\ninto reduced alertness.\nAnd I have only one\nfriend that texts up here,\nlike on the street\nholds his phone up here.\nIt looks ridiculous.\nAnd yet, you know, if we were trying\nto create more sense of alertness,\nif that's your goal,\npositioning computer\nscreens up high, chin up,\nlooking up if you need to kind\nof create an alertness signal,\nnot always being chin down and texting,\nor working into typewriters,\nor reading below us.\nis actually going to send a\nrecurring wakefulness signal.\nWhen things are up, we tend to be alert.\nWhen everything's focused\ndown, including our eyes,\nit tends to have a more suppressive\nor sedative type signaling\nto the deeper centers of the brain.\nNow, before we move on to\nthe science, and tools,\nand protocols related to pattern vision,\nI want to mention another\nstudy that was done\nby the University of Pennsylvania.\nThey have a terrific group\nthere that works on sleep.\nThey made an important discovery\nthat I think everybody should know about,\nwhich is that children that sleep in rooms\nthat have a nightlight or dim\nlights are much more likely\nto develop myopia, nearsightedness.\nConversely, children that\nsleep in very dark rooms,\nso either very dim\nnightlights or complete black,\nthey have a much lower,\nstatistically speaking,\na significantly lower probability\nof developing myopia, nearsightedness.\nNow, why is that?\nIt's because the wavelengths\nof light that matter\nfor these melanopsin cells,\noftentimes can get through the eyelids.\nAnd that's particularly true for children\nand people that have thin eyelids.\nSome people, like me,\nhave very thin eyelids.\nI've been told this before.\nNot many people touch my eyelids,\nbut among those that have,\nI have very thin eyelids.\nI notice I have very thin eyelids\ncompared to say, Costello.\nNow, Costello's eyes droop.\nHe can't even close his eyes\nall the way they're so droopy.\nBut many people have thin eyelids,\nand those people are going\nto be even more prone\nto light coming in through the eyelid.\nSo for parents, for kids, and for adults,\nyou really want to try to get to a place\nwhere you can sleep in a completely black\nor dark environment.\nOne little exposure to light, no big deal.\nBut this ties back to the other protocol\nthat I've described before in\nthe mood and sleep episodes,\nwhich is that viewing light,\neven a very low intensity\nbetween the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM\nis extremely detrimental to the dopamine\nand other mood producing\nsystems of the brain.\nIt can negatively impact\nlearning, and immunity,\nand even blood sugar,\nand make people type two diabetes prone\nby way of communication\nfrom these melanopsin cells\nto a structure in the\nbrain called the habenula.\nWhy am I throwing out all this verbiage?\nWell, because people have\nasked for more mechanisms.\nSo, if you really want to know,\nwhen you look at blue light\nor if blue light is getting\nin through your eyelids\nin the middle of the night,\nit is likely distorting\nthis lens accommodation\nmechanism in the eye\nand leading to myopia in some cases.\nSo, that's one reason to\navoid blue light exposure\nand bright light exposure,\neven nightlight exposure,\nin middle of the night.\nViewing any light of bright intensity\nbetween the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM\non a consistent basis is\ngoing to suppress dopamine,\nbecause of the way that that light\nactivates these melanopsin cells,\nand the habenula, and the dopamine system.\nSo it's all very simple,\nget as much bright light\nas you can safely, right?\nYou never want to look\nat any light so bright\nthat it's painful look\nat, during the daytime.\nTry and go without sunglasses,\nunless you need them.\nNow, I wear sunglasses for sake of sport\nand sake when it's really bright out,\nbut I try to get two hours a day\nof working outside or being outside,\neven if there's cloud cover,\nthat's going to offset myopia.\nIt's going to help you get better sleep.\nIt's going to support mood\nand metabolism, et cetera.\nAnd at night, if you're sleeping\nwith a lot of lights in the room,\nand especially, if there are\nkids that need a nightlight,\nyou should try and wean\nthem off that nightlight,\nbecause it's going to be beneficial\nfor their vision to wean\nthem off that nightlight\nand put them into a darker environment.\nObviously, you want to get\nthem emotionally comfortable\nwith that first.\nNow, let's talk about pattern\nvision, actual seeing things,\nlike faces and colors, et cetera.\nI'm presuming that some of\nyou out there are colorblind.\nWe can all help the red-green\ncolorblind folks out there\nby not using red in slides and diagrams,\nand on menus, and things of that sort.\nTry and use magenta instead.\nThey can see the contrast\nbetween magenta and green\nbetter than if there's red and green.\nSo, be kind to the\ncolorblind folks out there.\nIt's actually a fair percentage.\nAnd there are a lot of\ndifferent kinds of colorblind.\nI should just mention some\npeople are true monochromats.\nThey see the world in black and white.\nThat's exceedingly rare.\nMost colorblind people,\ncolorblind in quotes,\nare red-green colorblind,\nmeaning they lack red cone photo pigment,\nmeaning they can't see\nlong wavelengths of light.\nSo they see the world much\nas a canine or a cat does,\nwhere they don't get\nthe green-red contrast.\nThat's why we call it\nred-green colorblind.\nThey have the green cones,\nbut they can't do the contrast comparison\nthat I described at the\nbeginning of the episode.\nSo use magenta, and they\nwill be able to see things.\nYou wonder why stop signs and stop lights\nand things aren't in magenta.\nWell, because the world is unkind\nto the red-green color blind individuals,\nand they have to learn the\nposition of those lights\nin the street lights.\nAnd they have to learn\nthe shapes of signs,\nwhich they can do readily,\nand it usually says stop on it as well.\nBut if you care about\ncolorblind folks, which I do,\nthen we could all do them a service\nby, I think by law actually in the U.S.,\nmenus are required to be\ncolorblind accessible.\nHow can you improve your vision?\nHow can you get better at seeing things?\nWell, one way is to make sure\nthat you spend at least\n10 minutes a day total,\nat least, viewing things\noff in the distance.\nSo that would be well\nover half a mile or more,\ntry and see a horizon,\ntry and get your vision out to a location\nthat's beyond the four walls\nof your house or apartment,\nor the doors of your car, and\nthe windshield of your car.\nI know that can be hard to\ndo, but it's very valuable.\nIf you live in a city like New York\nand it's skyscrapers everywhere,\nyou've probably experienced\nthe incredible sense of relaxation,\nand it's aesthetically beautiful,\nwhen you are walking down\none of these long avenues,\nand you turn, and I think they have\na name for this in New York,\nwhere the sunset is suddenly visible\nalong a long avenue\nbetween some skyscrapers.\nAnd it's just very relaxing to be able,\nsuddenly, to see at a distance,\nand that's actually\nbecause this eye mechanism\nof relaxing the lens\nand relaxing some of the\nmusculature around the eyes\nsends signals deep into the brainstem\nthat release some of the centers\nthat are involved in\nalertness, AKA stress.\nAnd it's very pleasant for a reason.\nIt's not a, it's not a\nplacebo effect if you will.\nThere are a bunch of neurochemicals\nand things that are associated with that.\nSo try and see at a distance,\nbecause it's good for your eyesight.\nIt'll keep this lens nice and elastic,\nand the muscles nice and\nstrong that move the lens,\nand it has this relaxing component to it.\nNow, our visual system is\nexquisitely tuned to motion,\nnot just our self-generated motion,\nbut the motion of things around us.\nAnd one of the things that it does\nis something called smooth pursuit.\nSmooth pursuit is our ability\nto track individual objects\nmoving, as the name suggests,\nsmoothly through space\nin various trajectories.\nYou can actually train\nor improve your vision\nby looking at smooth pursuit stimuli,\nand that sounds really boring.\nWhat you can do is, and\nI'll provide a link to some\nthat I think are pretty good\nthat are used in various clinics,\nophthalmology and optometry clinics.\nYou can actually take\na few minutes each day,\nor maybe if you don't do it each day,\nyou could every third day or so,\nand actually just visually track a ball.\nSometimes it's moving in and\nkind of an infinity symbol.\nSometimes it's more of a sawtooth.\nSometimes it's changing speed.\nSometimes the cue that you're following,\nthe little target, is\ndilating and contracting.\nThis is going to keep the\nmuscles, I want to be clear,\nthis is going to keep\nthe extraocular muscles\nconditioned and strong\nand allow you to have a\nhealthy smooth pursuit system.\nRemember, the brain follows the eye.\nIt follows the movements of the eye.\nIt has to deal with that.\nAnd the neural circuits within the brain\nhave to cope with changes\nin smooth pursuit.\nSo if you're doing a\nlot of reading up close,\nyou're not viewing horizons,\nyou're not getting a lot of\nsmooth pursuit type stimulation\nfrom your life, or you're just getting it\nwithin the confines of a\nlittle box on your phone,\nlike your smooth pursuit is\nover, you know, millimeters\nor what we always talk\nin terms of visual angle,\nbut the amount of degrees of visual angle.\nBut if you're just\nlooking at smooth pursuit\nin this little tiny box on your phone,\nor on your computer screen,\nand you're not looking at\nobjects in your environment\nlike swooping birds and things like that,\nwhich I'm guessing many of you\nare not spending your time doing,\nwell, these mechanisms for smooth pursuit\nwill get worse over time.\nYour vision will get worse.\nAnd so, while I prefer that people\nget out into the real world\nand experience smooth pursuit\ntracking of visual objects,\nI don't know, maybe it's a good reason\nto go to a hockey game or, you know,\nand try and keep your eye on the puck,\nwhich I can never seem to do.\nIt moves so fast.\nOr I guess this is a good\nreason to watch live sports\nif that's your thing, or\nto watch a tennis match,\nlike a cat, like a kitten,\nwatching the ball go back and forth,\nwhatever, watching kids play,\nit doesn't really matter.\nThe idea is that you want to\nuse the visual system regularly\nfor what it was designed for,\nand smooth pursuit is a great way\nto keep the visual and\nmotion tracking systems\nof the brain and the eye\nand the extraocular muscles\nworking in a really\nnice coordinate fashion.\nI would say five to 10 minutes,\nthree times a week will be great.\nIf you care about your vision,\nyou can train your vision in this way.\nThe other one is to train accommodation.\nThere are a lot of videos out\nthere, I want to be clear,\non the internet, some of\nwhich are from clinicians,\nsome of which are not.\nSome of which are from scientists,\nsome of which are from other sources,\ntalking about things you can do\nto make your vision better,\nto improve your vision.\nMost of those are geared\ntoward improving the\nextraocular eye muscles,\nbut I did consult with\nour chair of ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of\nMedicine, Jeff Goldberg,\nwho's an MD and a PhD,\na phenomenal scientist,\nand a phenomenal clinician,\nand incidentally, a\nphenomenal chairman as well,\nabout what sorts of things, tools,\nare actually beneficial for\npattern vision and sight,\nbecause there's just so much\nout there on the internet.\nNot all of which is\naccurate or good, frankly.\nAnd he agreed that a\nsmooth pursuit stimulus,\nthat kind of training,\nas well as, or exercise,\nas well as near far.\nSo spending a few minutes,\nyou might even just do this\nfor two minutes of looking\nat something up close,\nthat's going to activate these\naccommodation mechanisms,\nand then moving it at arms length,\nand focusing on it for five, 10 seconds,\nmaybe more, maybe 15 or 20 seconds,\nthen slowly moving it into\na location, and then out.\nThis is actually a lot\nlike the visual training\nthat's done post-concussion\nto try and repair,\nactually repair some of\nthe balance, and motor,\nand visual, and cognitive\naspects of the brain.\nAnd we are going to have a guest on\nat a future time that,\nto deal with concussion and\nsome post-concussion training.\nA lot of post concussion\nrecovery and training\ncenters around the visual system.\nNot just because people are\ntrying to recover their vision\nand their sense of balance,\nbut because, as I mentioned earlier,\nthe brain's ability to make\nsense of its environment,\nand the brain's ability to parse time,\nnot just on the day-night schedule,\nbut also shorter time intervals,\nfollows the visual system.\nSomething we'll turn to a\nlittle bit more at the end.\nSo what does this mean?\nThe tool is, spend two to three minutes\ndoing smooth pursuit.\nThere's some programs on YouTube,\nor you can just look up\nsmooth pursuit stimulus,\nand I'll provide a link to\na couple I like as well.\nYou could do this with\na pen if you wanted.\nYou could do this.\nSomeone else could hold a\nwand, and you could do that,\nif you've got someone\nthat can do that for you.\nPractice accommodation for a few minutes,\nmaybe every other day,\njust bringing something in close.\nYou'll feel the strain\nof your eyes doing that.\nI can feel it right now, move it out.\nYou'll feel a relaxation point.\nMove it past that relaxation point,\nwhere you will have to do\nwhat's called the vergence eye movement\nto maintain focus on that\nlocation as it moves out,\nbring it back in.\nAt the point where you\nactually have to go cross-eyed,\nthis will differ for different people,\ndepending on how far apart your eyes are,\nso called interpupillary distance.\nSo for me, I have been teased before,\nI have a very short\ninterpupillary distance.\nI'm not a cyclops, but I'm heading there.\nSome people are more\nwalleyed, like a flounder.\nWell, depending on your\ninterpupillary distance,\nthe point at which things\nget blurry and cross-eyed will vary.\nBut for me, you know, as I get about,\noh gosh, I guess it's about\nsix inches from my nose.\nIt's really hard, I can't\naccommodate any longer.\nI move it out another inch,\nand everything's in nice focus.\nTry and see whether or not\nyou can get things closer.\nNow, you don't want to get cross-eyed.\nRemember what your parents told you,\nor my parents told me,\nthat if you cross your\neyes, when you're young,\nthat they can stay that way.\nActually, they won't\nnecessarily stay that way,\nbut your brain can\nstart losing information\nand the ability to see binocular depth,\nsomething we'll talk about in a moment.\nBut for now, the protocol would be,\nyou know, two to three,\nmaybe five minutes,\njust practice that,\npractice accommodation,\nand then be sure to give\nyour eyes some rest,\nget outside, look at a\nhorizon, or do nothing,\njust kind of let your eyes go soft.\nI guess what the yogis\nwould call soft gaze.\nJust kind of relax your eyelids,\nnot this, not eyes closed.\nJust relaxed, panoramic vision,\ntry and see the walls around\nyou without moving your head.\nExercise your eye muscles,\nexercise the accommodation\nmechanisms of your eyes,\npractice a little bit of smooth pursuit.\nYou don't have to be neurotic about this,\nbut if you do this often\nenough, meaning every other day,\nevery third day or so, you\ncan be the strange person\non the plane or in the\nclassroom doing this.\nYou know, that people might\nchuckle or look at you funny,\nor tease you, but that's okay,\nbecause you'll be able to see\nwhen they are losing their vision,\nso you'll get the last laugh.\nPlease don't laugh at them,\nbut maybe you can help them.\nAt that point, you can\nhold the pen for them.\nIt's worth doing.\nIt's really worth preserving your vision.\nAnd again, if you're a\nyoung person, this is great,\nbecause then you can actually build\nan extra strong visual system,\nusing all the tools that we're describing.\nI do want to talk about\na new set of findings\nthat are related to red light\nand offsetting age-related\nmacular degeneration.\nThere are a lot of ways\nin which our visual system\ngets worse over time,\nbut one is so called age-related\nmacular degeneration.\nGlen Jeffrey at the\nUniversity College London,\nsomebody I've known for decades as a,\nbecause he's a scientist,\nhas done beautiful work on\ndevelopment and function\nof the visual system,\nhas published a number of papers recently,\none that got a particularly high amount\nof attention in the press\nwas one that showed that\nflashing red light into the eyes\nearly in the day, not late\nin the day, early in the day,\ncan help offset some age-related\nmacular degeneration,\npresumably by enhancing\nthe mitochondrial function\nin the photoreceptors.\nThere does seem to be\nsome evidence for that.\nAlthough, it's still early days,\nI want to emphasize\nyou don't want to shine\nreally bright lights into your eyes.\nYou never want to look at any light\nthat's so bright that it's painful,\nand you never want to force\nyour eyelids to stay open.\nIf you need to close your eyes\nin order to be comfortable,\nwell, then chances are\nthat light is too bright.\nBut doing just a couple minutes a day,\nlike two minutes a day of flashing\nthis red light into one\neye, and then the other.\nAs long as it was early in\nthe day before noon time,\nand as long as it was in individuals\nthat were 40 years or older,\ndid seem to have a significant effect\nin offsetting some of the\nage-related macular degeneration\nthat would otherwise occur.\nAgain, these are early findings.\nIf you want to do this, please be careful.\nPlease talk to your optometrist\nand/or ophthalmologist.\nYour eyesight is precious.\nYou don't want to damage\nit, but it is interesting.\nAnd it does seem like red light\ncan improve the function\nof the mitochondria.\nThese photoreceptors have\na lot of mitochondria,\nthe energy-producing\norganelles within the cells,\nbecause they are some of the\nmost metabolically active cells\nin your entire body.\nYour photoreceptors\nare active all the time\nas you're looking around,\nand even when your eyes\nare closed, they're active.\nIn fact, through a weird\ntwist of the biology,\nand please look this up if\nyou're really interested in this,\nyour photoreceptors are actually\nmost active in the dark.\nThis is so weird.\nIt's a twist of biology, the\nway the system's arranged,\nthat when light comes on,\nthey shut off their activity.\nSo actually whether or\nnot you see something\nin front of you, like this pen or my face,\nis because the way your photoreceptors\nare turning off not turning on.\nIt's a really cool twist,\nand I don't want to go too\nfar down that rabbit hole,\nbut check it out if you're interested\nin how photoreceptors work.\nIt's an absolutely incredible literature.\nJust Google, excuse\nme, look up on the web.\nWe are not partial just to Google.\nI happen to use Google,\nbut use your web browser\nto look up photoreceptors\nhyperpolarization site.\nAnd you can learn a lot about that,\nif you're a real nerd for\nthis stuff, like I am.\nOkay, so red light to the eye,\ncan perhaps, it seems,\nhelp maintain vision,\ndoing smooth pursuit exercises,\nand accommodation near-far exercises.\nSome people suffer from poor eyesight,\nsimply because their eyes get dry.\nThere are incredible, believe it or not,\nlubricating mechanisms for the eye,\nnot just tears, but a thin sheet of oil.\nI mean, it's just amazing.\nUnless you have some\nsort of corneal abrasion,\nthe cornea is the clear stuff\non the outside of your eye,\ncorneal abrasion, when\nyou blink, it's smooth,\nyou don't feel it.\nIt's just really, really smooth.\nAnd yet, if you've ever\nhad a corneal scratch,\nI've had this, it's really\nrough, it is so painful.\nYou have a ton of pain\nreceptors in the cornea.\nThe lubrication of the cornea\nis supported by blinking.\nAnd while it seems a little silly,\nsome people actually\nbenefit from doing some,\nyou know, five or 10 or\n15 seconds of blinking,\nand then doing their focused work.\nSome people, their eyes are drying out,\nbecause as we focus, if\nwe're trying to do something,\nour eyelids stay open,\nthe eyes can dry out,\nbut it also can make it such,\nthat when we blink the next time,\nthere's a kind of a need to focus,\nbecause there's some distortions\nin these oils and liquids\nacross the corneal surface.\nIf you're somebody who\nsuffers from dry eye,\nI do hope they'll find a treatment\nor a cure for dry eye soon.\nThere isn't one at present.\nSomeone stands to make\na lot of money out there\nif you can find a cure for dry eye.\nLet the companies know or start a company,\nright now it's still a\nmystery as to how to do that.\nBut blinking for five 15 seconds,\nprobably slowly, not as quickly\nas I'm doing here on video,\nbut just, you know, maybe a\nblink every a second or two\nfor 15 seconds can lubricate the eyes.\nAnd that's not directly\nrelated to anything neural,\nit's just going to allow the\noptics of your eye to be clear.\nJust like when the screen\nof your phone gets dirty,\nlike when Costello's texting on my phone,\nand I pick it up, and it's\nlike covered with smudge,\nto clean it off in order\nto see things clearly,\nthe same thing is happening\nfor these optical devices\non the front of your brain.\nRemember, these are brain.\nOkay, so a lot of protocols today,\nalmost all of them behavioral protocols.\nI do want to talk a little\nbit more about vision\nand how it works internally.\nAnd then I also want to talk about\nsome of the foods and supplements\nthat have been shown to support vision\nand offset visual loss,\nand maybe even reverse some visual loss.\nLet's talk about binocular\nvision and lazy eye.\nI'm very familiar with lazy eye,\nbecause when I was a kid,\nI went swimming one day,\none day, and I didn't have my goggles.\nAnd so, something must\nhave been happening,\nas I recall, with the eye\nmoving down through the water,\nI've always had this problem\nthat I can only do the freestyle\nstroke off to one side.\nThe people I swim with\nare always laughing.\nSomehow, I kind of move toward drowning\nwhen I try and breathe on the right side.\nI think there's some asymmetry\nin the way I'm organized.\nAnyway, I was off to my left,\nand my eye kept going\nin and out of the water,\nand there was chlorine in the water,\nand it was making my own uncomfortable,\nso I just closed my eye.\nI just decided, you know,\nI knew more or less how\nto swim straight-ish.\nMight've bounced off the\nlane lines a few times,\nbut I just use the other\neye to kind of steer\nfor that mark on the wall.\nGot out of the pool,\ntook a shower, dried off,\nand then completely lost by\nbinocular vision for three days,\ncompletely.\nThe young brain, up until about age seven,\nbut maybe even extending\nout until about age 12\nis extremely vulnerable to differences\nin ocular input between the two eyes.\nMy scientific great-grandparents\nwon the Nobel Prize\nfor discovering so\ncalled critical periods,\nperiods of time in which\nthe brain is more plastic,\nmore able to change.\nThose two guys, David\nHubel and Torsten Wiesel,\nthank you, David and Torsten,\nforever changed the face\nof visual neuroscience\nand forever changed the way\nwe think about treatment\nof the young brain.\nIt used to be thought that\nyou wouldn't want to do\na surgery on a young kid,\nbecause of risk of anesthesia\nin young individuals.\nBut we now know that you need\nto repair these imbalances,\nthat even a few hours,\nokay, I don't want to scare\nanybody, I'll talk about reversal.\nBut a few hours of occluding\none eye early in life\ncan lead to permanent,\nunless something's done,\npermanent changes in the way\nthat the brain perceives\nthe outside world,\nsuch that when that\neye is opened up again,\nthe brain actually can't make sense\nof anything that's coming through it.\nIt shuts down that visual pathway somehow.\nSo what happened to me was,\nI actually was, my eye was fine.\nI got out of the pool, I opened my eye,\nbut I couldn't see through that eye.\nEverything was blurry, double vision,\nunless I covered this eye,\nand then I could see perfectly fine.\nFortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist\nwho understood the literature.\nThank you, Dr. Mark Lurie,\nwho understood the\nliterature and made it clear\nthat what I needed to do was\nto occlude the other eye,\nthe eye that was working very well.\nClearly, he understood the\nwork of you Huber and Wiesel.\nNow, again, you don't want\nto start playing games\nwith this kind of stuff when you're a kid.\nIf you wear, let's say you\nhave a Halloween costume\nand you wear an eye patch,\nyou're a pirate or\nsomething for Halloween,\nand you cover it up on one side,\nprobably for the night\nof Halloween, it's okay.\nI do not recommend doing\nthat recreationally\nif you don't need that\nif you're a young child\nor for your child to do that.\nBecause, indeed, you create imbalances\nin the brain machinery\nthat compares information\ncoming in through the two eyes,\nand it can shut down\nthe neural information\nfor the occluded, the closed eye.\nNow, I was able to reverse this issue,\nbut my binocular vision\nhas never been terrific.\nI'm much better at the dart board\nand still not very good\nif I close one eye.\nI'm much better at the pool table,\nif I close one eye, and\nI still am terrible.\nI was the kid in, you\nknow, in the outfield.\nYou know, the ball is coming towards me,\nthe ball's coming towards me,\nI'm going to catch the ball,\nand like it hit me square in the lip.\nMy binocular vision isn't great\nas a consequence of this early event.\nAnd I have a hard time with\nthose binocular stereograms,\nthose images that are kind of,\nyou're supposed to look at them,\nand then the binocular\ndepth image like pops out.\nAll the other kids were going,\noh, there's the, whatever,\nthe Statue of Liberty.\nThere's the [inaudible], and I see dots.\nOkay, so I have binocular\nvision, but I use other cues.\nI use the near-far cues\nthat I talked about before.\nMotion parallax, the fact\nthat things are closer to me\nare moving faster than\nthings further away,\nin order to judge depth.\nAnd years later, when I got involved in,\nand I don't suggest this for most people,\nI got involved in boxing and martial arts\nwhen I was younger.\nYou sometimes will see fighters,\nthis is a slip to avoid getting punched.\nIt's also generating motion parallax.\nMany animals judge depth\nby moving their head,\nnot by using other mechanisms\nof accommodation, okay?\nSo a lot of birds and monkeys and animals\nwill judge depth by moving\ntheir head like this,\nor they'll move from side to side.\nAnimals that will undulate sometimes\nare actually doing a depth measurement,\nbecause as you move from side to side,\nthe brain is able to do the math of depth.\nSo what does this all mean\nin terms of protocols?\nIf you're a young person,\ndo your best to get really\ngood binocular vision,\nnot just at level of your\nphone or your tablet,\nbut also at distance,\nyou will build strong\nbinocular visual machinery\nin the brain and at the level of the eyes\nand the eye musculature.\nNow, if you're somebody\nwho did have an occlusion,\nwhat's needed is to cover up the other eye\nto create an imbalance,\nso that the weak eye,\nthe so-called lazy eye,\nthis is sometimes\nreferred to as amblyopia,\nthat eye has to work harder.\nSo for me, they patched this other eye\nand made this eye,\neventually, I got vision\nthrough that eye back.\nthen they opened them both up.\nNow, you might ask,\nwhat happens if you cover\nboth eyes early in life?\nAnd this is where it gets interesting.\nYou might think, well, if covering one eye\nleads to poor vision for that\neye after that eye is open,\ncovering both eyes will\nprobably make you blind, right?\nActually, that's not what happens.\nWhat Hubel and Wiesel discovered\nand what's been affirmed\nmany, many more times over\nin subsequent studies is\nthat it's competitive,\nthat the two eyes are competing\nfor real estate up in the brain.\nSo if you actually cover both eyes,\nyou actually extend the\nperiod of critical plasticity.\nThis is a really interesting aspect\nthat other people are\nstarting to leverage now,\nin terms of how to reopen\nplasticity later in life.\nBut please don't, you know,\ngo around with your eyes\ncovered for too long.\nThere are some like retreats and stuff\nwhere people go into caves\nwith absolutely no vision.\nIt creates hallucinations.\nWe'll talk about why\nthat is in just a moment,\nbut here's my suggestion.\nTry and get balanced visual\ninput through the two eyes.\nAlmost everybody has a dominant eye.\nIt usually doesn't relate\nto your dominant hand,\nalthough it can.\nAnd so for me, if I cover up my right eye,\nI see much less well, much more poorly.\nIt's a little bit fuzzy,\nand I have to work harder\nin order to see the camera for instance.\nThen, if I cover up my left eye,\nit's actually really easy for me to relax.\nI have a dominant eye.\nNow, you can balance that out\nby covering up the dominant\neye a little bit each day,\nbut I would warn any young people,\nmeaning, you know, 12 or younger,\nagainst creating these imbalances\nif there isn't a clinical need to do that.\nAnd if you do have strong\nimbalances between the two eyes,\nwhich can be caused by\ncataract and lens issues,\ncan be caused by neuromuscular\nissues, et cetera,\nto try and get those dealt\nwith as early as possible\nby contacting a really\ngood ophthalmologist\nand ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.\nIt is very normal,\nI should say, it's very common\nfor young children, babies\nto have an eye that, with strabismus,\nthat either deviates\nout or that deviates in.\nIt is important to correct that.\nIf you would like to\nhave balanced division\nbetween the two eyes and for the brain\nto respond equally to the two eyes\nand to have, I would say high\nfidelity, quality vision.\nAlthough some people who\nhave an eye that drifts\ncan function normally in life,\nyou have an opportunity\nearly in life to rescue that.\nI won't do, well, maybe I will do this,\nbut I can actually relax this eye.\nIt's so weak, in some cases,\nthat it actually can start to deviate.\nHere, I'll just do this here.\nIt's not crossing my eyes.\nSo I actually can move my,\nI can misalign my eyes,\nbecause I have to fight very hard\nto have the musculature for this eye,\nkeep that eye aligned with the other eye.\nAnd that's because I've\nbeen doing eye exercises,\nsince I was in my twenties,\n'cause I noticed when I would study a lot,\nthis eye would start to drift\nin, I'd start to see double,\nand I would then, next thing you know,\nI was just covering the eye up,\nand it was getting weaker and weaker,\njust like the atrophy of a muscle.\nSo I went to the doctor, what did they do?\nThey did the exact wrong thing.\nThe optometrist I went to gave me a prism,\nwhich adjusted it so that I\ncould see things normally,\nwhich just made the eye weaker and weaker.\nIt's like putting a weak arm into a sling.\nSo I had to spend at least\nthree years of 10 minutes a day,\nis what I recommend, doing near-far,\ncovering up my good eye, doing\nnear-far with my bad eye.\nAnd now, it's been about 10, 12 years\nthat I have pretty\ndecent binocular vision.\nNow, many of you aren't dealing with this,\nor have these early childhood issues.\nSome of you might be experiencing\nchallenges with fatigued eyes\nor with differences in\nfocus with the two eyes.\nThese eye exercises of\nnear-far, smooth pursuit,\nand checking for dominant\nand non-dominant eye\ncan be very beneficial.\nI'm again, I'm not a\nclinician, so I don't want to,\nyou know, give you protocols\nor enforce protocols on anybody.\nYou need to figure out what's\nright and safe for you,\ngiven your vision history.\nI do recommend talking to a\nreally good ophthalmologist\nif you have severe vision\nproblems of any kind,\nor if you want to offset\nvision problems of any kind.\nAn optometrist as well,\nbut ideally would be a\nneuro-ophthalmologist.\nOkay, I did mention hallucinations,\nand they're fun to talk\nabout and think about.\nAnd for years, people have asked,\nwhy do people get visual hallucinations.\nCostello's in sleep right now,\nyou can probably hear him\nsnoring, he's snoring so loud.\nHe's probably having hallucinations\nabout rabbits, pizza, and\nthose are mainly his favorite,\nand sleep.\nHe's dreaming about sleep in sleep.\nHallucinations are a property\nof the visual system,\nand it was always thought\nthat hallucinations arise,\nbecause of over-activation or activation\nof certain aspects of the visual system.\nI just briefly want to mention a paper\nthat was published by my good friend\nand phenomenal scientist and\nphysicist for that matter,\nCris Niell who's up at the\nUniversity of Oregon in Eugene.\nThey studied LSD light compounds\nand discovered that\nhallucinations actually occur,\nbecause portions of your\nbrain become underactive.\nThe visual portions of your\nbrain are under-stimulated.\nThis is probably why,\nwhen people go into these cave retreats,\nsomething I've never done, I\ndon't think I ever will do,\nwhere it's completely black,\npretty soon, they start hallucinating.\nThey start seeing things, even\nthough there's nothing there.\nThe visual system is desperate\nto make guesses about\nwhat's out in the world.\nIt's like the eager beaver of your brain.\nIt's like, what's out\nthere, what's out there,\nwhat's out there?\nEven in low to no vision\npeople, blind people,\nthey are, their brain is\ngoing to be making guesses\nabout what's out there\nin the auditory world.\nWhat sounds are there? What\ntouch sensations are there?\nFor sighted folks, it's going to be,\nwhat's out there in terms of light?\nLight is the dominant way.\nVision is the dominant way\nthat we evaluate the world around us.\nSo it turns out that hallucinations\nare an under-activation\nof the visual system,\nand then a compensatory, a compensation,\nby which the visual system\ncreates activity and hallucinations.\nSo if you're in the dark long enough,\nyou start to hallucinate and see things.\nSo, that's a little note\nabout hallucinations.\nOne of the things that you\ncan do to improve your vision,\nand it's also kind of fun\nis to put a Snellen chart in your home.\nA Snellen chart is that list of letters.\nOr if you go to the dreaded\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles,\nactually I'm up for renewal soon,\nso I love the Department\nof Motor Vehicles.\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles,\nthey'll have you cover up an eye,\nread the letters on the chart,\nthe letters of course\ngets smaller and smaller,\nthey're trying to figure out\nroughly what your vision is.\nCover up the other eye, you'll do that.\nSome people including nerdy,\nvision scientists like me\nhave had Snellen charts in their office\nor in their home for many years now,\nand you can just practice,\nand you can see how you're doing\nsitting at a particular distance.\nYour, this is something\nthat's not often mentioned,\nbut your performance on the Snellen chart\nwill vary depending on time of day,\nbecause your level of fatigue\nand your ability to\ncontrol that accommodation\nand other mechanisms of\nthe eye muscles will vary,\nso you can take it as an average.\nIt's also a good thing,\nif you're going to get your vision tested\nfor corrective lenses,\nor maybe you're going to do laser surgery,\nor something of that sort,\nif you're thinking about any of that,\nto really get it measured\nby a professional.\nThe ones that you get\nin those supermarkets,\nor in many eyeglass stores,\napologies to the eyeglass stores,\nare often wrong by an order of magnitude.\nAnd then, when you start\nputting corrective lenses on\nthat are over-correcting\nor under-correcting,\nbut more often are over-correcting,\nwell, then you're essentially\nweakening the system.\nIt's like putting a prosthetic on a limb\nthat you didn't necessarily need,\nor robot arm when you didn't need\nthe use of the robot arm.\nAlthough now there's so much\nexcitement about robots,\nI think people are going\nto be doing that anyway.\nNonetheless, get your vision tested\nby somebody who really understands vision,\nlike an ophthalmologist or\na really good optometrist.\nIf you put a Snellen chart in your home,\nyou know, you can do that as\npart of your visual training.\nNow, this might seem excessively nerdy,\nbut what is more important\nthan your eyesight, right?\nEyesight is so vital.\nIt's right up there with\nmovement and our ability to move,\nto generate, to get up out of chairs,\nand to walk and to run, and\nto take care of ourselves.\nEyesight and movement are the main ways\nthat we are able to take care of ourselves\nand take care of others.\nWhen you start having compromised eyesight\nor compromised movement,\npeople need to take care of us,\nand we become much more challenged\nin moving through our daily life.\nSo while it might seem nerdy\nto have a Snellen chart in your home,\nor to do a smooth pursuit\nexercise a couple of times a week,\nor to get outside for a few hours a day\nand do your reading or\nyour laptop work there,\npreserving your eyesight\nand preserving your vision\nis one of the most life-enhancing\nor quality of life enhancing\nthings that you can do.\nAnd if you're a young person,\nand you can build some of\nthis into your framework\nof exercise or brain training,\nif you want to call it that,\nthat can be immensely beneficial\nand will really set you up\nto have really good vision\nover a long period of time.\nNow, of course, there are genetic factors,\nand there are injury-related factors\nthat can compromise eyesight\nand our ability to see.\nAnd, of course, the things\nI'm talking about today\naren't going to solve all those issues,\nbut they can have a\ntremendous, positive impact\nif you're willing to do\njust a little bit of work,\nand none of this is\ninvolving any cost, right?\nIt's just time cost.\nSo I want, I do want to talk\nabout a few other things\nthat can perhaps improve vision.\nI want to dispel a few myths about stuff\nto take to improve vision.\nAnd then, I want to just\nclose by talking about\nhow we perceive time using our vision,\nbecause that will nicely set the stage\nfor what we're going to\ntalk about next episode.\nSo now, you understand a lot\nabout the biology of vision.\nYou understand that light\nhas to arrive at the retina\nand get converted into electrical signals.\nThat process requires\nthings like vitamin A,\na fat soluble vitamin.\nIt requires things like the carotinoids.\nThat metabolic cascade,\nthe biochemical cascade,\nis essential for vision.\nAnd this is why you've been told\nthat carrots help you see better\n'cause they're high in vitamin A.\nThere are a few simple things you can do\nto support your vision.\nFirst of all, it is true\nthat eating vegetables,\nthe dark, leafy vegetables\nand things like carrots that\nhave vitamin A in abundance,\nand eating them in\nclose to their raw form,\nso naturally occurring foods\nthat contain a lot of\nvitamin A in their raw form\ncan help support vision.\nNow, does that mean that if you ingest\nsuper physiological amounts of that stuff,\nthat it's going to make your\nvision that much better?\nNo, but you do need a\nthreshold level of vitamin A\nin order to see and in order to see well.\nNow, there's a lot of excitement nowadays\nabout supplementation to\nhelp support the health\nof the visual system.\nAnd I'm somebody who's pretty open\nto novel forms of supplementation.\nYou've probably gathered that,\nif you've been listening\nto this podcast for awhile.\nYou have to determine what's safe,\nand economical, and right for you,\nwhat your risk tolerance is, et cetera.\nBut I want to talk about a molecule\nthat's in a lot of\nsupplements to support vision,\nand there are some really good\ndata on, and that's lutein.\nNow, the study I want to describe\nis actually published in 2016.\nIt's from the Journal of Ophthalmology.\nIt's a good journal.\nAnd the title of this paper is,\nit might catch your attention,\nit's \"Increased macular\npigment optical density,\"\nthat just means that macula,\nis an area of the eye for central vision,\nfor high acuity vision.\nPigment density there is\ngood, you want pigment there.\n\"Increase macular pigment optical density\n\"and visual acuity,\"\nVisual acuity is your ability\nto see things in fine detail.\n\"Following consumption\nof a buttermilk drink\n\"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks.\"\nRemember, raw foods?\nLutein-enriched egg yolks.\nSounds like a Rocky movie,\nwhere he would drink the raw egg yolks.\n\"A randomized double-blind\nplacebo controlled trial.\"\nNow, I'm not suggesting you\ngo out and eat raw egg yolks.\nThere's the risk of salmonella.\nAlthough, I did hear this,\nsomeone correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut the salmonella is actually\non the outside of the egg,\nnot actually in the egg\nitself, it's on the shell.\nFor reasons that relate to how\nthat egg got into the world,\nthat's where the salmonella lives,\nbut I could be wrong about that.\nBut raw egg yolks are not something\nthat most people want to consume.\nWhat is this lutein stuff?\nWell, lutein is in the pathway\nthat relates to vitamin A\nand the formation of the\nOPs in the photopigment\nthat captures light in\nthe back of your eye,\nliterally absorbs light\npigment in your eye,\nand converts that into electrical signals,\nand allows you to see.\nAnd there is some evidence,\nI spoke to our chair of ophthalmology,\nthere is some evidence through\nquality peer-reviewed studies\nthat supplementing with\nlutein can help offset\nsome of the detrimental effects\nof age-related macular degeneration.\nBut, I want to emphasize\nbut, or emphasize however,\nonly for individuals with moderate\nto severe macular degeneration.\nFor people that have normal vision,\nor with a, just a low-degree\nof macular degeneration,\nthese studies did not see\na significant improvement\nof vision from supplementing with lutein.\nSo, I'm not going to to tell you\nto supplement with lutein or not.\nI don't think any study\nis holy, but it does seem\nthat if you have moderate to\nsevere macular degeneration,\ntalk to your physician, of course,\ntalk to your ophthalmologist,\nI'll always say that, and\nI'll say it three times,\nsupplementing with lutein\ncould perhaps support vision\nand offset some vision loss in that case.\nProbably also talk to your ophthalmologist\nor consider the red light therapy\nthat I talked about earlier.\nWhereas, if you have normal vision,\nor a low amount of macular degeneration,\nit does not seem, at\nleast from these studies,\nthat lutein had much of an effect.\nNow, I know, and I confess\nI'm sort of of the mind\nthat if I personally had\nage-related macular degeneration,\nor a propensity for it in my family,\nwhich fortunately I\ndon't, but in that case,\nI would think that\nsupplementing with lutein,\nprovided it's safe, could\nperhaps be of benefit.\nYou might want to consider\na low dose of that.\nSo again, I'm not pushing any of this\non anybody by any means,\nbut you should know that,\nunder certain conditions of\nsevere macular degeneration\nor moderate macular degeneration,\nit does seem like lutein\ncan be beneficial.\nIt does not have to be\nconsumed through raw egg yolks,\nalthough that is the\nhighest density source.\nCooking the egg yolk, cooking your eggs,\nif you like your scrambled eggs dry,\nor you like your eggs not easy\nover or whatever, not runny,\nthen you aren't going to get\nthe benefits of the leucine.\nThere are other sources of leucine,\nnon-animal sources of leucine as well.\nYou can look those up on the internet.\nNow, there are other\ncompounds that have been shown\nto perhaps be important for offsetting\nor helping different forms of vision loss.\nOne is, I'm going to spell\nthis out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E,\nidebenone, idebenone, idebenone,\nI can never pronounce these\ncompounds, forgive me,\nunless I've worked with them.\nThere is evidence that\nit can be beneficial\nfor Leber's congenital eye disease.\nI would definitely go on to examine.com,\nput in I-D-E-B-N-O-N-E.\nAnd for things like\nLeber's optic neuropathies,\nwhich is a degenerative\ncondition of the eye,\nwhether or not people should\njust be taking this stuff anyway\nis still an open question.\nThere aren't a lot of studies about it.\nA lot of people that are interested\nin taking things to support their vision\nare taking lutein as a\npreventative measure.\nI don't pass any judgment\none way or the other.\nTypically, those supplements\nalso include the zeaxanthins\nand astaxanthins.\nOkay, the pronunciation of\nthis is terrible, I'm sure,\nbut that's not too far off,\nbut basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.\nYou can see why it's hard to pronounce,\nZ-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.\nAnd the other one is\nA-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.\nBoth of these have been shown, excuse me,\nboth of these have been shown\nto offset some of the disruption in vision\nthat occurs with aging.\nWhat is astaxanthin?\nIt's a really interesting compound.\nIt's the red-pink pigment\nfound in various seafoods.\nSo shrimp, I'm not a big seafood fan,\nbut like certain fish, like the,\nyou'll see at the fish market\nwill have that red-pink pigment.\nAnd it's also in the\nfeathers of flamingos,\nplease don't eat the\nfeathers of flamingos,\nand please also don't eat flamingos.\nIt's structurally similar to betacarotene,\nso it's very pro vitamin A,\nbut it has some chemical differences,\nwhich may make it safer than vitamin A.\nRemember, vitamin A is\na lipid-soluble vitamin,\nso it can be stored in our\nbody for long periods of time.\nWhat is the deal with this astaxanthin?\nYou know, what are its drawbacks?\nWell, we can go to our\never favorite examine.com.\nWhat does it do?\nWell, it has a number\nof different effects,\na huge number in fact, but it\ndoes seem to notably increase,\nit's now been shown in three studies,\nthe antioxidant enzyme profile.\nIt has a number of different effects,\nbut the most notable for\nsake of this episode,\nis the one on ocular blood flow.\nIt does seem to increase the\namount of ocular blood flow,\nso the blood supply to the eyes,\nso that makes it an interesting compound.\nIt has a number of other effects.\nFor whatever reason, it\nalso has a notable effect,\nseveral studies have shown\nthis, on fertility in males.\nSo it seems to at least\ndouble the pregnancy rate\nwhen men take astaxanthin\nand works as, in particular, it seems here\nin men that were previously infertile.\nSo, I don't know if that has something\nto do with the blood flow\nto the eyes, probably not.\nIt probably has something to do\nwith something unrelated to the eyes.\nNonetheless, that's an\neffect of this molecule.\nIt's also been shown to\nhave positive effects\non things like skin\nelasticity, skin moisture,\nskin quality, et cetera,\nprobably due to its effects on blood flow.\nSo lutein, astaxanthin,\nA-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N,\nand for people who have concerns\nabout Leber's optic neuropathies,\nwhich is going to be a small\npercentage of people out there,\nbut that is a pretty severe condition,\nthere are supplements that\nare available out there.\nI do encourage you, as always,\nto talk to your ophthalmologist\nand physician about them.\nAnd I will say that there\nare a number of people\nthat take lutein and some\nof these other things\nas a precautionary measure, in\norder to bolster their health\nin the same way that some people\ntake vitamins and minerals\nto bolster their health,\nand some people are\nvery health, excuse me,\nand some people are very averse\nto taking vitamins and minerals,\n'cause they feel like\nthey can get all that\nfrom healthy, whole foods.\nAnd of course, you can get\nthese things from whole foods.\nThe question is whether\nor not you can get them\nin concentrations that are sufficient.\nI do think that in the years to come,\nwe are going to see more about lutein.\nI think we are going to see more\nabout some of these other\ncompounds like astaxanthin,\nand hopefully by then I'll\nbe able to pronounce it.\nBut, at present, these\nthings are more or less\nin the kind of experimental\nor self-experimental phase.\nThere are some good double-blind\nplacebo controlled studies,\nlike the egg yolk buttermilk\nstudy of all things\npublished in really good journals.\nJournal of Ophthalmology,\nJournal of Investigative\nOphthalmology and Vision Sciences,\nthese are good journals.\nThese are journals are\npeer-reviewed by experts.\nThe study that I mentioned\nearlier about keeping rooms dark\nthat was also published\nin an excellent journal,\nI think it was JAMA.\nI'll go back and look, it's\nnot on my screen any longer,\nbut very easy to find,\nand there been some\nfollow-up studies as well\nfrom the University of Pennsylvania\nand other universities.\nSo everything I've talked about today\nrelates to studies that were done\nand published in quality,\npeer-reviewed journals.\nThat doesn't necessarily\nmean you want to run out\nand start taking this\nstuff that I've described,\nor even doing the\nprotocols I've described,\nI've given you an array, a\npalette, a buffet if you will,\nof things that you could\ndo to try and enhance\nor support your vision.\nDepending on how good your vision is,\nyour family history of\nvision and vision loss,\nyour occupational hazards.\nYou know, people that\nwork with metal filings\nthat are flying out of machines\nare going to have a\nhigher degree of vision,\nyou know, risk to their visual system\nthan well, people who just do office work.\nAlthough, if you're doing\na lot of office work,\nchances are you're not getting\na lot of long-view vision.\nYour accommodation mechanisms\nare going to start to suffer over time.\nI think we can reliably predict that.\nSo I've tried to give you an\narray of behavioral tools,\nand we did touch upon some\nsupplementation tools.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't say that,\nbecause blood flow is so critical\nfor the neurons of the eye,\nremember, these are the most\nmetabolically active cells\nin your entire body, the\ncells within your retina,\nbecause blood flow is required to get them\nthe energy and nutrients they need,\nhaving a healthy\ncardiovascular system, right,\ndoing endurance work,\ndoing strength training work regularly,\nis going to support your\neyes, and your brain,\nand your vision.\nIt's indirect, but it's essential, right?\nIt's necessary, but it's\nnot going to be sufficient.\nYou're going to have to do other things\nto support your eyesight, as well.\nBut having a healthy\ncardiovascular system,\nbecause it's going to deliver\nblood and oxygen and nutrients\nto this incredible apparati\non the front of your face,\nthese two pieces of brain,\nis going to support your\noverall brain health\nand vision over time.\nSo early in the podcast,\nI talked about how the optimal window\nfor learning is 90 minutes.\nThat's the so called\nultradian cycle for learning.\nThat's why we had all our\nepisodes to about 90 minutes.\nThey're now starting to extend\ninto the hour and 50\nminute and two hour mark.\nThat simply reflects my\nenthusiasm and excitement\nabout these topics and\nmy desire to give you\nas much information as I\npossibly can in
