    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate from\nmy teaching and research roles\nat Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've been getting my blood\nwork done for many years now,\nand that's where the simple reason\nthat only through quality blood work,\nand now through the advent of DNA test\ncan one really get a clear picture\nof what's going on with their health.\nThings like metabolic\nfactors and hormones,\nall the various triglycerides.\nThese are things that can only be measured\nfrom a quality blood test.\nAnd now with DNA tests,\nyou can get an additional window\ninto your current health status\nand the trajectory of your health.\nWhat's really wonderful\nabout InsideTracker\nis that you don't just get numbers back\nabout the specific levels\nof various hormones\nand metabolic factors,\nyou also get a lot of information about\nwhat you could or should do in\norder to adjust those numbers\nto put you on the course to better health.\nSo for instance, it will\ngive recommendations\nabout particular foods to eat or avoid,\nparticular exercise regimens\nthat you might want to adopt\nand the frequency of those regimens\nin order to move those markers\nin the correct direction.\nInsideTracker has also added a new feature\nthat makes tracking your progress\nand analyzing your data even easier.\nFor those of you that use\na Garmin fitness tracker\nsuch as the Garmin watch,\nthat's now compatible with their platform.\nSo you can couple your\ndata from your Garmin\nwith your blood and DNA for\neven more personalization\nand insights on your health.\nHowever, if you don't\nhave a Garmin device,\nthere's still a lot that you\ncan get from InsideTracker\nand their tests.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\nwww.insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nUse the code Huberman at checkout,\nthat's www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans\nand use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also brought to us\nby ExpressVPN.\nExpressVPN is a virtual private network\nthat keeps your data secure and private.\nIt does that by routing\nyour internet activity\nthrough their servers and encrypting it,\nso that no one can see or sell your data.\nI'm familiar with the effects\nof not securing my data\nwell enough.\nA few years back I had\nmy bank accounts hacked.\nI don't know exactly how it\nhappened, but it happened.\nAnd it was a terrible amount of work\nto have that reversed and secured.\nThe great thing about ExpressVPN\nis I don't even notice\nthat it's running.\nI have it on my computer,\nI turn it on anytime I work at home\nor when traveling or in\na cafe airport anywhere,\nand it runs in the background,\nit doesn't change anything\nabout the interface\nwith my computer or the wifi.\nIt just secures my data and\nit secures any information\nabout what I happen to be\nsearching for, et cetera.\nI don't feel like I have\nanything particular to hide\nexcept my bank account passwords\nand things of that sort.\nBut with ExpressVPN, it basically\nmakes everything secure,\nyou can't be tracked and no one can access\nor steal your data, which is terrific.\nSo again, I use it when I'm\ntraveling and when I'm at home.\nIf you want to start protecting\nyour internet activity\nusing ExpressVPN, you can go\nto www.expressvpn.com/huberman\nand you'll get an extra three months free\non a one-year package.\nThat's www.expressvpn.com/huberman\nto get three months free\non any of their one-year packages.\nToday's podcast is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,\nmineral, probiotic drink,\nthat gives you a total foundation\nof vitamins and minerals\nand probiotics to support\nyour health and wellbeing.\nI've been using Athletic\nGreens since 2012.\nAnd so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nI started using Athletic Greens\nand I still use Athletic\nGreens once or twice a day\nbecause it's the simplest\nand most straightforward way\nto get my basis of\nimportant vitamins, minerals\nand probiotic taken care off.\nAll of those things combined\nto support various aspects\nof my health,\nsuch as brain health, such as gut health.\nFor instance, there's a\ntremendous amount of evidence now\nshowing that probiotics support gut health\nand that the gut brain access\nis important for things like\nfocus and cognition, as\nwell as for immune function\nand various aspects of physical\nhealth, like metabolism.\nThe list sort of goes on and on.\nWith Athletic Greens,\nit has all these vitamins and minerals\nand various other things\nthat are good for me,\nand I actually really\nliked the way it tastes.\nSo the way I use it is once a day,\nsometimes twice a day,\nI'll mix it up with water,\nI add a little bit of lemon or lime juice.\nI think it tastes great without\nthe lemon or lime juice.\nBut when I add that, it's\ntruly delicious to me.\nAnd I'll drink that\nfirst thing in the day,\nmid-morning sometimes instead\nand sometimes again in\nthe later afternoon.\nI'm able to drink Athletic\nGreens late in the day\nand not have it keep me awake.\nIf you want to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nwww.athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make mixing up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nreally simple and easy.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3+K2.\nVitamin D3, as many of you know,\nyou can get from the sun,\nbut many people even if\nthey're already getting\na lot of sun exposure,\nstill have vitamin D3\nlevels that are too low.\nAnd vitamin D3 is very important\nfor a huge number of\ncardiovascular, immune,\nmetabolic and other aspects of health.\nSo once again, if you go to\nwww.athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou'll get the five travel packs\nand a year supply of vitamin D3+K2.\nToday is the third episode\nin our series of episodes\nabout physical and\nathletic skill performance\nand skill learning in general.\nAnd today we're going to talk\nabout the science of tools\nfor fat loss.\nAnd fat loss is something\nthat interests a large number of people.\nMany people want to lose fat,\nmany people are athletes\nwho need to lose fat.\nAnd in general, we know that\nhaving body fat percentages\nthat are too high is unhealthy for us.\nAnd most people struggle to lose fat.\nMost people struggled to\nlose weight generally,\nbut most people especially\nstruggled to lose body fat\nor what we call adipose tissue.\nNow, this is a huge topic on the internet.\nThere's a lot of controversy.\nToday, we're going to\ntalk about some things\nrelated to fat loss,\nand that are powerful for fat loss\nthat I'm guessing most of you\nhave never heard about before.\nYou may have heard about a few of them,\nbut I'm guessing you haven't\nheard about all of them.\nThis episode is going to be\nrich with science-based tools\nthat are gleaned from a variety of aspects\nof the literature,\nincluding the use of cold,\nincluding brown fat,\nincluding something called beige fat.\nWe're going to talk about\nsomething called NEAT.\nWe're going to talk about all\nsorts of aspects of fat loss\nthat are governed by your nervous system.\nAnd this is I think an important gap\nthat's missing in the\ndiscussion about fat loss.\nYou can hear a lot of\ninformation out there\nabout the role of things like insulin\nand various diets like ketogenic diets\nor vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.\nAnd there's some great stuff out there,\nand there's some really\nterrible information out there,\nand there's a lot of controversy.\nWe did a number of episodes talking\nabout the role of hormones on metabolism\nand the role of food\non mood and wellbeing.\nSo if you're interested in those topics,\nplease check them out.\nI will touch a little\nbit on hormones today.\nThings like insulin and\nleptin, just a little bit.\nBut today's episode is mainly\ngoing to be focused on,\nhow the nervous system, neurons,\nand some of the cells\nthey collaborate with,\nlike glioma and macrophages,\nhow those encourage or can\nencourage accelerated fat loss.\nBecause it turns out they can.\nRemember your nervous system\nwhich includes your brain\nand your spinal cord\nand all the connections\nthat they make with\nthe organs of the body,\ngoverns everything.\nIt's the on switch and the\noff switch for immune system.\nIt's the on switch and the off switch.\nIt turns out also for fat burning.\nAnd so the nervous system\nand the role of the brain\nand other neurons has\nbeen vastly overlooked\nin the discussion about losing fat.\nNow, I would be remiss\nand I'd probably come under\na pretty considerable attack,\nif I didn't just acknowledge upfront\na core truth of metabolic science\nand also of neuroscience, frankly,\nwhich is that calories\nin versus calories out,\nmeaning how many calories you ingest,\nversus how many calories you burn\nis the fundamental and\nmost important formula\nin this business of fat loss\nand weight management in general.\nThere's simply no way around the fact\nthat if you ingest far more\ncalories than you burn,\nyou're likely to gain weight.\nAnd a good portion of that weight\nis likely to be adipose tissue fat.\nIt's also true that if\nyou ingest fewer calories\nthan you burn,\nthat you will lose weight,\nand that a significant portion\nof that will come from body fat.\nWhat portion?\nDepends on a number of factors.\nBut that simple formula is important.\nOn a previous episode, I\nmentioned the complications\nwith the statements of\na calorie is a calorie.\nAnd indeed there is\nevidence from for instance\nRobert Lustig, who's a\npediatric endocrinologist\nat UC San Francisco has talked\nabout how highly processed\nfoods change the way\nthat we utilize food,\nand can lead to higher\nincidences of obesity\nand other metabolic syndromes\nthat go against the idea\nthat a calorie is a calorie and that's it.\nSo a calorie is a calorie\nas a unit of energy,\nand we need to accept and\nacknowledge this calories in,\nmeaning calories ingested\nversus calories burned formula.\nBut the calories burn portion\nis strongly influenced\nby a number of things that you can control\nthat can greatly accelerate\nor increase the amount of adipose tissue\nor the proportion of adipose tissue\nthat you burn in response\nto exercise and food.\nSo your hormones are important.\nYour thermogenic milieu,\nmeaning how warm or how cold your body is?\nHow cold you make it,\nhow warm you make it?\nBut also your level of metabolism.\nYour levels of thyroid hormone\nand something that's\nhardly ever discussed,\nbut is well supported by\nthe scientific literature,\nhow much innervation?\nMeaning how much connectivity there is,\nbetween your nervous system and fat.\nToday, we're going to talk about the fact\nthat your body fat of various kinds,\nand there are several kinds of body fat\nare actually innervated by neurons.\nNeurons connect to your body fat\nand can change the probability\nthat that body fat will be burned or not.\nSo your nervous system\nis the master controller\nof this process,\nand it plays a strong\nrole in the calories out,\nthe calories burned component.\nSo as usual, we're going to\ndiscuss a little bit of science.\nI promise I won't go\ntoo deep into lipolysis\nand all sorts of things\nrelated to fat oxidation.\nWe're going to break down that process\ninto two important steps.\nAnd if you can understand\nthose two important steps\nthen the rest of the tools\nwill be very straightforward\nto understand and manage.\nAnd I do believe that\ntoday you will walk away\nwith many new tools that\nyou could incorporate\ninto any kind of fat loss regimen\nthat will greatly accelerate that process,\nbecause it's grounded in\nquality peer-reviewed science.\nThroughout the episode,\nI'm going to talk about\nsome behavioral tools.\nIn fact, I'll mostly talk\nabout behavioral tools.\nI will also talk about\ncompound, supplements.\nMany of you are into supplements.\nSome of you aren't, and that's fine.\nFor those of you that\nare into supplements,\nan important issue in a\ndiscussion about supplements\nfor fat loss or otherwise\nis going to be the quality\nof those supplements and the accuracy\nabout what's in those\nsupplement bottles and tablets,\net cetera.\nI usually mention this at\nthe end of the podcast,\nbut this podcast we've partnered\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.\nBecause Thorne we believe\nhas the highest levels\nof stringency in terms of\nthe quality of the compounds\nin their supplements and the\namounts of those compounds.\nIf you want to see the supplements I take,\nyou can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.\nYou can see the supplements that I take,\nthat will also allow you to get 20% off\nany of those supplements,\nor 20% off any of the other\nsupplements that Thorne makes.\nThorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic\nand all the major sports teams.\nSo there's a very strong\nbasis for their stringency.\nAgain, you don't need to use supplements.\nI'm certainly not encouraging\nanyone to use supplements\nif that's not your thing,\nbut if you're going to use supplements,\nmake sure that your supplement source\nis one a very high quality.\nWith that said, I want to get started\nand talk about the\nvarious tools for fat loss\nand how neuroscience,\nneurons control fat loss.\nBefore I do that,\nI want to set the context correctly\nand extract some of the key takeaways\nfrom previous episodes,\nbecause if your foundation of health\nand your foundation of hormones\nand your foundation of\nmetabolism isn't right,\nit's going to be very hard to get the most\nout of any kind of exercise\nor fat loss protocol.\nIn previous episodes, I\ntalked all about the science\nand the details going\ninto particular protocols.\nWe don't have time to do that now,\nand I want to get to the new material.\nHowever, there are a couple bins,\na couple items that you should make sure\nyou're getting correctly.\nAnd if you're not perfect about\nthese, don't worry about it,\nmost people are not perfect about them,\nI'm certainly not perfect about them.\nBut we should all be\nstriving to get quality\nand sufficient sleep.\nI did four full episodes on sleep\nand how to get better at sleeping\nthrough things like light\nexposure, temperature,\ntiming your sleep correctly\nfor your so-called chronotype,\nif you're a night owl or a morning person.\nThat's the first four\nor I think five episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nGet your sleep right,\nget your light exposure right,\navoid bright light in your eyes\nat times you wanted to be asleep,\nand get bright light in your eyes\nat times you want to be awake.\nSo get your sleep right.\nThe other thing is essential fatty acids.\nI talked about this in\nthe food and mood episode,\nbut I also talked about it\nduring the hormones episodes.\nWe need fatty acids.\nThey are vital to so many\naspects of our health.\nYou don't have to get\nthem from supplements.\nYou can, if you want to,\nbut you need to get them from your food.\nThey are essential.\nThere's a reason there's an\nE the essential part there.\nOf the fatty acids,\nthere are multiple kinds,\nbut for the antidepressant effects\nwhere the levels of fatty acids\nthat will promote good mood\nand also healthy metabolism\nand we'll start to shift the\nneedle in the right direction\non bloodborne cardiovascular factors.\nThe key thing is to get the levels of EPA\nthat you ingest above\n1000 milligrams per day.\nSo that doesn't mean just\ntaking a thousand milligrams\nor more of say fish oil or krill oil\nor whatever your preferred source is.\nIt means getting above a\nthousand milligrams of EPA\nwhich may require that you\ningest more essential fatty acids\nthan just a thousand milligrams per day.\nThat of course can be\ndone through food sources,\nthings like fatty fish,\nor if you're not into eating fish,\nyou've quality meats that\nare grass raised can do that.\nThere are other sources\nof essential fatty acids,\nof course also from plant sources.\nSo look, those up online.\nIt's really easy to find.\nBut the research and the literature shows\nthat you want to get above\na thousand milligrams\nof EPA per day,\nbecause that's when you can\nbest support your metabolism\nand position yourself for good fat loss.\nAs well for people who\nhave cravings issues,\nthey crave sweets all the time,\nI talked about this in\nthe gut-brain episode\nand hormones and food.\nThat you have neurons in\nyour gut that are craving,\nthey're seeking essential fatty acids\nand they're craving and seeking\namino acids from your food.\nNow, these are not supplements\nthat they crave per se,\nthey're craving those things\nbecause that's what your body\nneeds and your brain needs.\nBut those same neurons\nwill respond to sugars.\nAnd so many people who are craving sugar\ncan satisfy that sugar\ncraving by giving the neurons\nso to speak what they actually want,\nwhich are amino acids and\nessential fatty acids.\nThat includes EPA, but\nalso things like glutamine\nand amino acid that can\nreally reduce sugar cravings\nif you take a teaspoon of that,\nor even a tablespoon of\nthat a few times a day.\nYou have to ease into that a little bit,\nbecause some people can get\na little bit of GI distress\nfrom too much glutamine.\nBut glutamine has also been\nshown to improve symptoms\nof leaky gut.\nIt's a powerful amino acid.\nAnd yes, you can also get it from food.\nThings like cottage cheese are\nhigh in glutamine, et cetera.\nAnd then finally you can't\nreally position yourself\nto have a strong metabolism\nif your iodine levels\naren't correct,\nand your thyroid levels aren't correct.\nYou can overdo iodine.\nSo you don't want to do that.\nA lot of table salt\nhas iodine added to it,\nbut some people need to add iodine,\nby ingesting things like kelp, et cetera..\nBut one of the best ways to\nsupport the thyroid system\nand metabolism in general,\nis to make sure you're\ngetting enough selenium.\nSometimes called selenium each day.\nSimple way to do that is to ingest\nthe highest concentration of selenium food\nthat I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts,\none or two or three of those per day.\nYou'll have more than enough selenium\nto meet the thyroid needs.\nYou don't want your\nselenium to be too high,\nyou don't want a diet\ntoo high in anything.\nSo again, sleep, sufficient EPAs,\nglutamine if you have\nissues with leaky gut\nor sugar cravings can really help.\nGet your gut microbiome, right?\nI may have missed saying that,\nbut get your gut microbiome right.\nThat does not necessarily mean\nyou need to ingest probiotics.\nYou can, if you want to,\nbut you can also just\nsimply ingest a serving\nor two of fermented foods per day,\nthat can greatly assess.\nSo things like sauerkraut, kimchi,\nevery culture has a different source\nor sources of fermented foods,\nthose can really help the gut microbiome,\nand then make sure that\nyour thyroid hormone\nis supported through the ingestion\nof sufficient iodine not too much\nand sufficient selenium, not too much.\nOkay?\nSleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods,\niodine and selenium.\nThat sets the basis for how things\nlike exercise, cold and\nsome of the compounds\nand other things that we're\ngoing to talk about today\nthat are I'm guessing going\nto be truly new to many of you\nthat can really increase the\nburn factor in the equation\nof calories in versus calories burned.\nOkay?\nSo on the one hand we have\nthis reality of calories in,\nversus calories burned.\nHowever, I would also be\nremiss if I didn't mention\nan incredible study that\nwas done by my colleague,\nAlia Crum at Stanford.\nShe's a faculty member,\nprofessor in the psychology department.\nLooking at how belief affects,\njust thinking can impact\nthe effects of things\nlike exercise on weight loss.\nThese are just incredible results.\nWhat they did was they took subjects\nwho were hotel service people\nthat would clean the hotels\nand come in and change\nthe linens and so forth.\nDivide them into two groups.\nOne group, they were told moving around\nand doing your duties for your job,\nmeet the standards for US\nguidelines for activity\nand movement, et cetera.\nAnd a basic lecture about how movement\nis good for you, et cetera.\nBut mostly just that\ntheir daily activities\nmet the standards for the US.\nThe other group, however, was\ngiven a bunch of information\nabout how movement and their daily routine\nwas very good for cardiovascular health,\nit could be good for\nweight loss, et cetera.\nAnd then they tracked these subjects\nover a period of many weeks.\nThe take home message from this study\nwas that simply being told\nthat movement is good for you\ncan lead to weight loss, et cetera.\nLed to significantly more body fat loss,\nwaist-to-hip ratio\nchanges in the direction\nthat most people would want.\nBut essentially a slimming\ndown, if you will.\nAnd all sorts of other positive effects\non things like cardiovascular health.\nSimply by the knowledge\nthat movement and exercise\ncan help various health markers.\nSo this is remarkable and it speaks\nto the power of the nervous system\nand the power of belief in\ngoverning aspects of our body\nand our physiology that\none would otherwise think\nwe're outside our conscious control.\nNow, of course, any of you\nthat think scientifically\nwhich I imagine if you watch this podcast\nor listen to this podcast\nis all of you by now\nprobably thinking,\nwell, maybe they just moved around more,\nor maybe they stood up and sat down more,\nmaybe they did something\nelse that was different.\nAnd indeed there's a strong possibility\nthat they did things differently\nthan the other group,\nbut the mere knowledge that\nexercise is good for you,\nthat movement is good for you,\nshifted their behavior\nand their physiology\nin the direction of enhanced weight loss,\nfat loss, et cetera.\nSo how we think about a\ngiven set of activities\naffects how we perform those activities.\nAnd how we think about and\nperform those activities\nhas a real effect on our physiology.\nSo somewhere between\nthe hard and fast rule\nthat governs fat loss and weight loss,\nwhich is if you ingest more\ncalories than you burn,\nyou'll either maintain or gain weight.\nTypically, you'll gain weight,\nalthough not always.\nIf you ingest about as\nmany calories as you burn,\nyou'll maintain weight, typically.\nAnd if you ingest fewer\ncalories than you burn,\ntypically you'll lose weight.\nThat's the kind of rule of fat loss.\nAnd yet we also have these\nbelief effects which show,\nand this has been\nreplicated again and again,\nthat how we think about a process,\nwhether or not we think it's beneficial\ncan change our physiology in ways\nthat can be beneficial to us.\nSomewhere in between those two extremes\nof hardcore metabolic science\nand belief of why a bunch of protocols\nthat are grounded in quality\npeer-reviewed science\nand in physiology that you can leverage\nto increase the rates of fat loss.\nAnd so that's what we're\ngoing to talk about today.\nI love this topic and it's not\nthat I'm so obsessed with fat loss,\nbut rather the first the project\nI ever worked on in science\nwas thermogenesis and fat loss.\nI joined a laboratory as an undergraduate,\nand the guy I worked for\nloved to explore new compounds\nand how they impacted thermogenesis.\nAnd so we looked at how\nthings like MDMA/Ecstasy,\nhow antipsychotics, antidepressants,\nvarious weight loss drugs\nthat were on the market.\nHow those impacted body temperature\nand fat loss and metabolism?\nAnd we just had so much fun doing it.\nSo if you detect a smile on my face,\nthat's what that's about.\nAnd I also learned a lot,\nand I also came to really appreciate\nthat this tissue of our bodies,\nadipose tissue and fat,\nwe think of as just this unfortunate thing\nthat's like we're told\nit's a core energy source\nif we ever entered a famine\nand that's all true, et cetera.\nYou come to realize that\nthe cells in our body,\nthey are there as fuel for\nthe furnace of our body,\nwhich is our metabolism.\nAnd there's a third player.\nAnd that's where it\nreally gets interesting.\nThat the nervous system,\nneurons has the opportunity\nto turn up the intensity of that furnace.\nIt has the opportunity to\nincrease the amount of heat\nthat we produce and therefore\nthe amount of energy\nthat we burn.\nAnd I was also really intrigued\nby something which is that,\ngrowing up, I think we all know people\nwho can eat a tone and never\nseem to gain any body fat.\nOr people who seem to eat very little\nand seem to gain body fat very easily.\nAnd I was always intrigued by that.\nAnd it turns out there are a\nnumber of different factors\nthat relate to that.\nBut the nervous system is the one\nthat we can really control.\nBoth through behaviors and what we eat,\nbut also in terms of this thing\nthat we call thermogenesis.\nThere was one particular\nstory I want to relate to,\nthat does not suggest any protocol.\nIn fact, I'm going to discourage you\nfrom following this protocol.\nPlease do not try the compound\nthat I'm about to describe.\nOne of the favorite things\nthat we like to do in that lab\nwas to find rare compounds and test them.\nAnd at the time I was\nreading about thermogenesis\nand I learned about a compound\nthat was actually discovered\nin the armory factories\nof World War II.\nAnd it was discovered\nbecause women in particular\nwho were working in these factories\nwould take a brush and\ndip it in a compound\nor a paint rather,\nand they would then paint\nthe numbers with a stencil\nonto things like bombs and\nammunition of various kinds.\nAnd they were losing weight like crazy.\nIt turns out that occasionally\nthey'd lick the brush,\nand then they would go back\njust to get a sharper point\non the brush,\nand then they would paint\nonto these various bullets\nand missiles and so forth.\nBombs and so forth.\nAnd they started shedding\nall their body fat.\nAnd many of them losed, excuse\nme, lost a lot of weight,\na significant portion of their weight\nwithout changing anything\nelse that they were doing,\nwhat they were eating, et cetera.\nIt turned out that that compound\nis something called Dinitrophenol, DNP.\nAnd over the years Dinatrophenol,\nDNP has gained popularity\nin some niche cultures,\nmainly bodybuilders, athletes\neven in the modeling industry.\nIt is a absolutely terrible\ncompound for anyone to use,\nbecause it's highly fatal\nif your body temperature\ngoes too high.\nHyperthermia will kill you.\nAnd indeed many people have\ndied using Dinatrophenol\nas a weight loss drug or attempting\nto use it as a weight loss drug.\nBut Dinitophenol really\nillustrates a principle\nwhich is that your\nmetabolism includes things\nlike thyroid hormone and\ngrowth hormone, et cetera.\nBut your body temperature\nand the way you utilize energy\nis controlled by your nervous system.\nAnd the way Dinatrophenol works\nis by changing the neurons\nand the way that the\nneurons that connect to fat\nchange the way fat burns up.\nSo we are not going to suggest,\nI am not suggesting that\nyou use Dinatrophenol.\nHowever, there are other things\nthat you can do that can\nchange the relationship\nbetween these neurons\nand the fat of your body\nin ways that can powerfully\naccelerate fat loss.\nAnd I don't know why we don't\nhear about these things more,\nbut probably because most of what you see\nout there on the internet focuses\nmore on what you could eat and should eat\nor shouldn't eat.\nIt concentrates on exercise regimens\nwhich we will also talk about.\nBut the burn factor,\nyour thermogenic\nenvironment is one of the,\nif not the most important factors\nin this business of fat loss.\nAnd since I'm a neuroscientist\nthat's what we're going to talk about.\nSo let's talk about fat utilization.\nLet's talk about how fat\nis converted into energy\nwhich is sometimes also\ncalled fat burning.\nWhat I'd like you to know\nis that this is a two-part process.\nOkay?\nIn reality, there are\nmany biochemical steps.\nAnd if you log onto the internet,\nor you open up a textbook\nand you want to learn about\nfat utilization,\nyou're going to see a lot of chemistry.\nAnd I'm happy to go deep into\nthat chemistry if you like.\nBut I think most of you\nare probably interested\nin what are the leverage points?\nWhere can you exert control\nover this process in ways\nthat benefit you?\nSo I'm going to focus mainly on those.\nOkay?\nThis is not to upset the aficionados\nand I will put in some\nnomenclature, but here we go.\nThere's two parts to this process.\nOne, is fat mobilization.\nAnd the second is fat\noxidation or utilization.\nOkay?\nSo the first thing that\nhas to happen for body fat\nto get burned up or used and reduced\nis that it has to get mobilized.\nAnd that's a process called lipolysis,\nbut I actually don't care if\nyou know the name lipolysis,\nyou just have to move that\nfat out of the position\nthat it's in.\nYou have to get it out of the fat cells.\nAll right?\nFat cells can be visceral\naround our visceral organs\nor they can be subcutaneous\nunder our skin.\nMost people are thinking\nabout subcutaneous fat\nwhen they think about fat.\nSo here's the deal.\nAnd if you want more detail,\ngreat, I'll touch on that in a bit.\nBut basically stored fat has two parts\nthat are relevant here.\nIt's got the fatty acid part,\nand that's the part\nthat your body can use.\nAnd that's attached to\nsomething called glycerol\nand they're linked by a backbone.\nSo already, probably too much\nchemistry for both of you.\nBut what you want is you\nwant to break the backbone.\nSo if you just can\nremember to mobilize fat,\nyou got to break the backbone\nbetween glycerol and these fatty acids.\nOkay?\nThat's accomplished by\nan enzyme called lipase,\nbut you can forget all that if you want.\nRemember, we're just\ntrying to mobilize fat.\nSo the first step is to\nget those fatty acids\nmoving around in the bloodstream\nto get them out of those fat cells.\nAnd then they can travel\nand be used for energy.\nAnd that second part,\nremember first part is mobilization.\nThe second part is oxidation.\nIs then those fatty acids,\nthose are potential fuel.\nThey're just potential fuel,\nbut you haven't burned the fat yet,\nyou've just moved it\nout of your fat cells.\nThey're going to go into cells\nthat can use them for energy.\nAnd once they are inside those cells,\nthey're still not burned up.\nYou need to oxidize them.\nThink oxidation is the burnup part.\nThey need to be moved\ninto the mitochondria\nand then they can be converted\ninto ATP into energy.\nSo just to really zoom\nout again to make sure\nI don't lose anybody.\nYou got to mobilize the fat,\nthen you have to oxidize the fat.\nIn other words, you have to mobilize it,\nthen you actually have to\nconvert it into energy.\nIf you just mobilize it,\nand you don't convert it into energy,\nyou don't oxidize it,\nit can be returned to body fat.\nAnd many of the things that\nthe nervous system can do,\nis to increase the mobilization of fat,\nbut also the oxidation of fat.\nOkay?\nSo you have two opportunities\nto burn more fat,\nand both of those\nopportunities are governed\nby your nervous system.\nBy neurons that literally\nsend little wires\nthat we call axons into\nfat and release chemicals\nthat provide a stimulus\nfor more of that fat\nto be mobilized,\nand then later for more of\nthat fat to be burned up.\nOkay?\nSo we could go really deep on this,\nbut I'm not going to go\nmuch deeper than that,\nbecause this isn't a biochemistry\nof fatty acid metabolism lecture.\nThis is about how to burn fat\nusing your nervous system.\nBut remember, there's a mobilization step,\nand then there's an oxidation step.\nI think anyone of you,\nall of you should be\nable to internalize that.\nMobilize then oxidize.\nOkay?\nMobilize then oxidize.\nSo what are these neurons\nthat connect a fat doing?\nWhat are they releasing exactly?\nHow do they actually\nincrease fat mobilization?\nAnd how do they increase fat oxidation?\nBurning of fat.\nWell, there are a couple\nof things that they release\nthat encourage that process.\nAnd the main one that you need\nto know about is epinephrine\nor adrenaline.\nThe conversion of these\nfatty acids into ATP\nin the mitochondria of cells\nis favored by adrenaline.\nOkay?\nAnd adrenaline is\nreleased from two sources.\nAdrenaline is released\nfrom the adrenal glands,\nwhich set a top our\nkidneys and our lower back.\nAnd it's also released\nfrom the so-called\nsympathetic nervous system.\nAlthough that name is a bit of a misnomer,\nbecause it has nothing\nto do with sympathy,\nhas to do with stimulating alertness\nand promoting action of the body.\nThere's a big mistake in the literature\nthat is finally being\ncorrected among those who know.\nThe mistake in the literature\nis that the adrenal glands\nand the release of adrenaline\nis what stimulates fat loss\nand fat oxidation.\nIn fact, it was thought for a long time\nthat adrenaline swimming\naround in your body\nof when you're fasted,\nbecause fasting can increase adrenaline\nor when you're engaging\nin intense exercise\nor when you're stressed is\ngoing to promote fat oxidation.\nThat's actually not the case.\nThe adrenaline that\nstimulates fat oxidation,\nthe burning of fat is coming from neurons\nthat actually connect to the fat,\nnot hormones like adrenaline\nthat are swimming around\nin your system.\nIt's a local process.\nAnd this is very important\nbecause it means that,\nwhat you do, the specific\npatterns of movements\nand the specific environment you create\nthat can stimulate these\nparticular neurons to activate fat,\nmeaning to release fat,\nto mobilize it and then to burn it,\nis going to be a powerful\nlever that you can use\nin order to increase fat loss.\nSo what have we said so far?\nWe've said that you've got to\nmobilize and you got to burn fat\nand that your nervous system\nis in control of that process.\nIt's not just about calorie deficit.\nOkay, so let's talk about how to activate\nthe nervous system in\nways that it promotes\nmore liberation, movement,\nmobilization of fat\nand more oxidation of fat.\nSo one of the most powerful\nways to stimulate epinephrin\nwhich is also called\nadrenaline from these neurons\nthat connect to fat and\nto thereby stimulate\nmore fat mobilization and\noxidation is through movement.\nBut I'm not talking about exercise.\nThe type of movement\nthat I'm referring to,\nis extremely subtle.\nAnd some of you may be familiar\nwith this type of movement,\nbut I'm guessing you're\nprobably not familiar\nwith what I'm about to tell you,\nwhich is that shiver or\nshivering is a strong stimulus\nfor the release of adrenaline\nepinephrin into fat\nand the increase in fat\noxidation and mobilization.\nBut shiver is not just induced by cold,\nand there are other\nsubtle forms of movement\nthat can greatly increase\nfat metabolism and fat loss.\nThere was a group in England\nduring the 1960s and 70s\nthat discovered a pathway by\nwhich subtle forms of movement\ncan greatly increase fat loss.\nThis is the work of Rothwell and Stock.\nIt's very famous in the\nthermogenesis literature.\nAnd I learned about this early on,\nwhen I was an undergraduate and I asked,\nhow did they come across this?\nAnd here's how the story goes.\nThey were aware that some people overeat\nand yet don't put on weight.\nOther people overeat\neven just a little bit\nand they seem to accumulate\nextra adipose tissue.\nNow, this is long before\nall the discussions\nabout microbiome and\nhormone factors, you know\nit was long before many\nof the hormone factors\nbesides insulin had even been discovered.\nWhat they did was they\nexamined people who overate\nand did not gain weight.\nAnd what they observed was\nthat those people engaged\nin lots of subtle movement\nthroughout the day.\nIn other words, they were fidgeters.\nAnd that's what they call them.\nI'm not going to do the British\naccent version of fidgeters.\nBut Roth and Stock were British.\nWhat they found were people that overeat\nbut don't gain weight as a consequence.\nAnd in fact, many people who\nhad low levels of body fat\nhad a lot of resting tremor,\nnot of the Parkinsonian type,\nbut they would bounce their\nknee while they were sitting,\nwhen they would talk,\nthey would engage in\nvery angular movements,\nthey were sort of electric.\nIn fact, now in science,\nI was chuckling about\nthis as I was diving back\ninto this literature,\nbecause the other day I\nheard a wonderful lecture\non a totally different topic\nfrom a colleague of mine\nand we all adore him.\nHe's over in Europe\nand he's this tremendously\nsuccessful scientist.\nSo we like to poke fun at him.\nAnd every one of his movements\nis incredibly electric\nand staccato.\nAnd he's rail thin and\nhe eats like a horse.\nAnd so it fits very\nwell into the discovery\nof Rothwell and Stock who discovered\nthat fidgeters people\nthat bounce their knee,\npeople that have a head bob\nwhile they're listening,\npeople that nod a lot,\npeople that stand up and sit\ndown a lot throughout the day,\nand people that pace\nburn anywhere from 800\nto 2,500 calories more\nthan the control group\nin the experiments that they looked at.\nAnd indeed, there's been a\nmodern look into all this,\nand these numbers check out\nthat simply moving around a lot,\neven if those are subtle movements,\ngreatly increases the amount\nof energy that you burn.\nAnd people who overeat,\nthe people who can have the\nsecond or the third doughnut\nor doughnuts at all and\ndon't seem to put on weight\nto the same degree,\nthey are people that move\naround a lot even when seated.\nThey're are people that\nwill often move their limbs\nvery quickly as well.\nThere even have been studies\nthat have explored other things\nthat correlate with fidgeters.\nFidgeters stand up very\nquickly at the end of a lecture\nor they start to gather\ntheir things very quickly,\nwhereas non fidgeters don't.\nSo dogs like my bulldog Costello,\ndefinitely not a fidgeter.\nEvery movement is incredibly\nslow and deliberate.\nSitting down as a process,\nif you ask him to sit down\nand sort of a slow motion.\nYou ask him to get up\nand he kind of looks at\nyou sighs and stands up.\nThe fidgeter is the\nopposite of that, right?\nYou say, how are you doing?\nThey go, great.\nSo even sometimes their\nspeech will be accelerated\nalthough not always.\nBut staccato movements,\nfidgeting, et cetera.\nAnd in 2015, and again in 2017,\nthere've been studies\nthat have explored this,\nusing some modern metabolic tracking\nand indeed simply moving a lot,\nbeing a fidgeter, bouncing your knee,\nstanding up and pacing several times\nor many times throughout the day\nled to considerable amounts\nof fat loss and weight loss\nwhen people were ingesting\nthe same amount of food,\nif they overate, they\nwere able to compensate\nand burn off that food.\nAnd if they were trying to lose weight\nand they incorporated\nthis fidgeting protocol\nof deliberately trying to fidget more\nand move around during the day,\npace, stand up more quickly,\nsit down more often,\nsit down and stand up more often rather.\nThey found that they greatly\nincreased their weight loss\nanywhere from 20 to 30% increases.\nAnd in some cases, you know,\nthere always those few people\nwho burned a lot more.\nIt seems to work best in people\nwho are already slightly overweight.\nSo for people that are overweight,\nwho are kind of averse to exercise,\nfidgeting might actually\nbe a good entry point.\nAnd 800 to 2,500 calories\nis a considerable amount\nof calories when you\nreally think about it.\nNow, why am I telling you this?\nWell, there's clearly a\ntool to export from this,\nwhich is that you can increase\nthe amount of calories burned\nwithout having to go on\nadditional long runs.\nI do hope that people\nare exercising regularly\nbecause it's so important\nfor other aspects of brain\nand body health.\nBut nonetheless, we are all time limited\nand we are not all so\nready to embrace exercise.\nI have a family member\nwho has been slowly coaxed\ninto exercise,\nbut if I were to tell her, for instance,\nyou need to fidget more,\nshe'd probably go for it.\nSo this is a powerful way\nto increase the calories\nthat are burned.\nNow, that's great.\nAnd you can think about the protocols.\nBut I want to nest that protocol\nin what I said before,\nwhich is that, fat is\ncontrolled by these neurons\nand the epinephrin they release.\nYou might say, well, how could\nthese little micro movements\nlead to so much caloric burn?\nAnd that's where it\nreally gets interesting.\nRothwell and Stock and\nothers that they worked with,\nsubsequently found that these\nlittle fidgety movements,\nthe engagement of certain\naspects of our musculature\nthat are nothing like exercise.\nIt's not these large coordinated\nor rhythmic body movements,\nbut rather subtle little\nbits of fidgety movement.\nAnd here I am doing a lot of\nfidgety movement as an example,\ntapping the pen, this kind of thing.\nI was probably that kid\nin class most of the time.\nAnd I was like, I try not\nto do it to irritate people,\nbut I was definitely a knee bouncer.\nI'm not particularly lean or not.\nBut I was definitely...\nThis is a common activity for me.\nPeople that do that sort of thing,\nit turns out that it's not\nthe kind of caloric burn\nthat we normally think of,\nof like, oh, you'll\nrunning, lifting weights,\nswimming, yoga, et cetera.\nThose subtle movements\nof our core musculature,\nnot just the core, but all our limbs\nand our musculature,\nthose low level movements,\nthey trigger epinephrin\nrelease from these neurons,\nand they stimulate the\nmobilization of fat.\nAnd then that fat is\noxidized at higher rates.\nAnd I find this fascinating.\nI wish more people knew about it,\nwhich is why I'm telling\nyou about it today.\nThis has nothing to do with exercise\nin the traditional form,\nand yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day.\nThat's a considerable\namount of fat oxidized.\nIf you are in a calorie maintenance mode\nor if you're sub caloric,\nthat's going to add to it\nstill additional fat loss.\nThe data on this are tremendous.\nI'll link to a few studies.\nIf you're really interested in learning\nabout what's called neat.\nN-E-A-T which is non-exercise\nactivity thermogenesis.\nNEAT.\nSo what's the protocol?\nFidget.\nIf you're really interested\nin burning calories\nand you already exercise,\nyou want to burn more\nor you don't have the\nopportunity to exercise\nor you're averse to exercise\nfor whatever reason,\nfidgeting, movements, staccato movement,\nstanding up, walking around, pacing,\nall the sort of nervous activities\nthat were so critical of other people\nand sometimes in ourselves\nare actually mobilizing and oxidizing\na lot of fat and a lot of energy.\nAnd while this probably won't compensate\nfor chronic overeating,\nthe caloric burn from\nthis is considerable,\nand very likely can offset a meal\nthat had excessive calories\nor a kind of steady\nstate of eating too much.\nAnd it also starts to open\nup all sorts of thoughts\nand discussion about when you travel,\nyou tend to eat foods\nthat are kind of outside\nyour normal ones.\nWe tend to eat foods that\naren't so great for us,\nwe also tend to be a\nlittle bit more sedentary\nwhen we travel we're on\nthe plane, et cetera.\nBut all of that aside,\njust the use of something\nlike low-level movement.\nAnd it's almost like a tremor,\nbut also these select short,\nsmall fidgety movements.\nI'm intentionally doing\na lot of these today.\nSo you have examples that you can use\nto select from if you like.\nThese can have a major effect on fat loss\nand it raises a second tool.\nIf these low, meaning\nthese small movements\nthat we engage in trigger\nepinephrin adrenaline release\nfrom these neurons of the\nsympathetic nervous system\nthat innervate fat and increase\nfat mobilization and oxidation.\nNow, it should make sense why shivering\nis one of the strongest stimuli\nthat one can incorporate\nto stimulate fat loss.\nNow, shivering is almost\nalways associated with cold.\nWe think shivering, we think cold,\nbecause when we get cold, we shiver.\nAnd there are two ways that\nshivering can increase fat loss.\nAnd there are several ways\nthat you can use shivering,\nyou can leverage shivering\nand you can leverage cold\nto accelerate fat loss.\nBut you have to do it correctly.\nAnd most of the people that are using cold\nand frankly suggesting cold\nas a means to increase metabolism fat loss\nare suggesting the exact wrong protocol.\nIn fact, the one I'm going\nto recommend is 180 degrees\nin the opposite direction\nto the typical protocol\nthat you'd hear about.\nSo let's talk about how to use cold\nand how to leverage shiver as\na particularly strong stimulus\nto increase fat loss through\nmobilization and oxidation\nof these fatty acids.\nSo in recent years there's\nbeen a growing interest\nin the use of cold for\nvarious things like,\nimproving stress tolerance,\nimproving metabolism,\nrecovery from exercise.\nI've talked about a number of those things\nand the uses of cold on this podcast.\nIn fact, did an episode on\nhow to supercharge performance\nthrough palmer cooling, cooling the palms\nin specific ways or the\nbottoms of the feet.\nAnd if you're interested in that,\nand how to improve performance\nin endurance and strength,\nyou can check out that episode.\nBut most people out there\nare using cold exposure\ntypically by taking cold showers\nor by getting into cold\nwater of some other kind,\na lake or a river or a\ncold bath or an ice bath.\nAnd they are doing that\nprobably with mixed goals,\nmeaning they both would like\nto increase their metabolism\nand burn fat, as well as\nimprove mental resilience.\nSince today, we're talking\nabout accelerating fat loss\nthrough the use of science-based tools.\nI want to emphasize a study\nthat was published in nature\njust a couple of years ago,\nshowing exactly how cold\nincreases metabolism and fat loss.\nOkay?\nSo we have several kinds of fat.\nThree kinds in fact.\nWe have white fat, white adipose tissue,\nand we have brown fat\nor brown adipose tissue.\nAnd there's a third kind\nwhich is beige adipose tissue.\nWhite fat is the type\nthat we traditionally\nthink of as fat, subcutaneous fat.\nAnd it is not particularly\nrich in mitochondria.\nIt is there as an energy storage site\nand we have to mobilize the fat out\nas we talked about before\nand burn it up elsewhere.\nBrown fat largely exists\nbetween our shoulder blades\nand on the back of our\nneck, between the scapulae.\nAnd it's rich with mitochondria\nwhich is why it's called brown fat.\nAnd brown fat has a\nparticular biochemical cascade\nwhereby it can take food energy,\nit can take food, basically,\nbreak it down and convert it\ninto energy within those cells.\nAnd there's some\nadditional steps involved,\nbut unlike fatty acids from white fat\nwhich have to travel elsewhere\nget broken down in mitochondria\nand convert into ATP, et cetera.\nUsed by the mitochondria rather.\nBrown fat is thermogenic.\nIt can actually use energy directly.\nIt skips a step, and I\ndon't want to get diverted\nby going into all the biochemistry of it.\nBeige fat is sort of in between.\nIt's white fat that could be brown fat,\nbecause it has some mitochondria in it,\nbut not as many as brown fat.\nNow, cold exposure does several things.\nMaking ourselves cold\ncan allow us to build up\nmental resilience because\ngetting into cold of any kind,\ndoesn't matter if it's a cryochamber,\ndoesn't matter if it's a cold day\nand you forgot your sweater or your parka.\nIt doesn't matter if it's an ice bath\nor you're lying down in the snow.\nCold causes the release of\nadrenaline from your adrenals.\nAnd it causes the release of epinephrin\nfrom these neurons that connect to fat.\nNow, the big effects of cold on metabolism\nand fat burning are going\nto be through two routes.\nOne, is that if you\nexpose yourself to cold,\nyou have the opportunity to\ntrigger activation of brown fat\nas well as to convert more\nbeige fat into true brown fat.\nSo you essentially create a\nstronger or a hotter furnace.\nThat's the way to think about brown fat.\nIt's like a furnace.\nAnd so with this principle\nthat we started with a calories\nin versus calories burned.\nWhat you're doing is you're\nincreasing the amount\nof burning,\nyou're increasing the burn of energy\nby increasing the intensity\nof the heat inside you\nso to speak.\nOkay?\nI'm talking here kind of metaphorically.\nNow, how can you do that?\nWell, if you get into cold water\nor an ice bath or a cold day,\nand you try and remain\ncalm and resist shivering,\nyou actually short circuit\nthis mechanism for increasing\nbrown fat thermogenesis.\nThe paper published in nature shows\nthat it is shivering itself\nthat causes the brown fat\nto increase your burning,\nyour burn rate and your metabolism.\nAnd it works like this,\nwhen you get into cold and you shiver,\nthe shivering that low level\nmovement of the muscle,\nthose small movements triggers\nthe release of a molecule\ncalled succinate.\nS-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.\nAnd succinate acts on the brown fat\nto increase brown fat thermogenesis\nand fat burning overall.\nIt actually increases body heat\nthrough this brown fat\nthermogenesis pathway.\nAnd it also over time can\nincrease the amount of brown fat\nby converting beige fat\ninto true brown fat.\nNow, how much cold exposure and how often?\nThat's the key.\nBut before I give that\ndetail or set of details.\nRemember if you resist the shiver,\nyou are not going to get the\nincreased metabolic effect,\nbecause you are not going to\nget the succinate release.\nSo if you want to get your body heat,\nyour thermogenic level to go up,\nyou need to shiver.\nSo now we have the NEAT,\nthe non-exercise activity thermogenesis.\nSo low levels of activity\nas I described before,\nwhich are done away from cold,\nmaybe do them in cold as well.\nAs well as shiver in response to cold.\nAnd so the shiver itself is valuable\nfor triggering the release of succinate.\nIn fact, succinate is being evolved now\nby various drug manufacturers\nas a potential treatment for obesity.\nAlthough it hasn't really hit the market\nin its final form yet.\nSuccinate is powerful for\nits effects on brown fat.\nSo how many times a week do you need\nto expose yourself to cold?\nWill depend on how much\nfat you're trying to lose,\nand how much you're trying\nto increase your metabolism.\nThere are studies that describe\npositive effects on fat loss\nof exposing yourself to cold,\neither through cold\nshower or through ice bath\nor other cold water.\nIt doesn't have to\nactually have ice in it,\nprovided it's cold enough\nfor anytime, anywhere,\nexcuse me, between one\nand five times per week.\nBut it turns out that\njust one exposure per week\ncan be valuable.\nThe question then is how long to get\ninto that cold environment?\nAnd how cold should that environment be?\nSo first let's talk about how long\nto get into that cold environment?\nThe answer here might be\na little bit different\nthan you might imagine.\nMost of you might think,\noh, well if one minute is\ngood, three minutes is better,\nand if three minutes is better\nthan 10 minutes is best.\nBut remember the goal is\nto get the shiver induced\nrelease of succinate,\nso that succinate can\ntrigger the brown fat.\nIt turns out that if you\nwant to trigger the shiver,\nwhat you want to do is\nto get into the cold\nand then get out of the cold\nand typically not dry off,\nand then get back into the\ncold and out of the cold,\nthat will definitely\nstimulate more shivering\nthan just getting into the cold itself.\nSo what I'm not referring to,\nis getting into the cold\nenvironment like an ice bath\nand waiting until you shiver\nand staying there shivering.\nOkay?\nYou also don't want to get hypothermic.\nAnd I want to be clear.\nYou want to get approval from your doctor\nbefore you do any of this.\nWhen you get into cold water,\nthere are two factors that will dictate\nwhether or not you shiver.\nProbably three,\nbut let's just talk about the main two.\nOne, is how cold it is.\nSo how cold should it be?\nAnd look, if you get into\nwater, that's very, very cold.\nIt can actually shock your heart.\nIt can actually give you a heart attack\nif it's truly, truly ice cold,\nand you're not adapted to that.\nSo proceed with caution, please.\nI'm not a physician and I don't\nwant to see anyone get hurt.\nJust cold enough to be uncomfortable\nis a good place to start.\nSo for some of you that's\ngoing to be 60 degrees,\nfor some of you that's\ngoing to be 55 degrees,\nfor some of you it's going\nto be high thirties, right?\nDepends on how cold adapted you are,\nand people vary in terms of how\nwell they tolerate the cold.\nSo what you need to do\nis find a temperature\nthat you can get into one to five,\nprobably one to three times a week.\nIf you really want this\nto accelerate fat loss.\nAnd you want to get in until\nyou just start to shiver,\nand then you want to\nget out and not dry off,\nwait anywhere from one to three minutes\nand then get back into the cold.\nNow, you'll notice when\nyou get back into the cold,\nit'll almost seem soothing,\nit might actually not induce shiv...\nIt might take away the\nshiver that you had.\nSo here's a potential\nkind of sets reps protocol\nthat you can play with.\nFind a temperature then\ninduce a shiver for you.\nThat's going to vary depending\non your cold tolerance\nand how cold adapted you are.\nOne to three,\nmaybe five times a week,\nget in until you...\nOr get under the shower or whatever it is,\nuntil you start to shiver.\nGenuinely shiver.\nThen after about a minute or so, get out,\nspend one to three minutes\nout, but don't dry off,\nget back in for anywhere\nfrom one to three minutes,\nbut try and access the shiver point again.\nAnd you might do three\nrepetitions of that.\nSo it's three times in\nand three times out total.\nOkay?\nThat's a great starting place.\nAnd what you don't want to\ndo is build up your tolerance\nto cold so fast,\nthat pretty soon you're\nable to resist the shiver,\nbecause remember the shiver\nis the source of the succinate release\nthat will trigger brown fat thermogenesis.\nSo if you'd like to see\nthis protocol spelled out,\nyou can access it zero cost at a website\nwhich is www.thecoldplunge.com.\nThe Cold Plunge is a company\nthey make cold plunges,\nand they were kind enough to gift one\nto the Human Lab Podcast.\nBut I want to emphasize that\nthese protocols are free of cost.\nThe folks at the Cold Plunge\nare not just interested\nin marketing their product,\nbut one of their main\ninterests is encouraging people\nto engage in cold exposure\nfor particular end points\nand goals like fat loss,\nresilience, et cetera.\nResisting inflammation.\nBut their main focus is\nproviding people protocols\nand encouraging people to use\ncold exposure of various kinds\nnot just through their products,\nbut through cold rivers\nand jumps in the ocean\nand things like cold showers,\nwhatever is most convenient\nand accessible for various people.\nAnd so we needed a place\nwhere we could house\nthese protocols in a permanent way,\nand not just for this episode.\nBut so what they've agreed to do is,\nto post the protocols there,\nthey should be very easy\nto find on their website.\nThis particular protocol we're referring\nto as the fat loss optimization protocol\nfor lack of a better name.\nAnd it's really grounded in how cold\nit can be used to induce shiver.\nAnd again, it doesn't really matter\nhow you're accessing that cold,\nprovided you access to the shiver,\nand you're moving from\nthe cold environment\nto a slightly warmer environment.\nSo getting out of the cold shower\nor getting out of the ice bath, et cetera,\nor out of the cold plunge,\nand then back in.\nBecause it turns out that the cooling\nand rewarming process of the\nbody is where shiver kicks in.\nAnd so that's distinctly different\nthan just trying to get into the cold\nand stay in the cold\nfor as long as possible.\nAnd if you zoom out a little bit\nand think about some examples in life,\nyou'll understand why\nthat must be the case.\nFor instance, people who do\na lot of cold water swims,\nyou have these polar bear clubs,\nI think they call themselves.\nThey do these cold water swims.\nI would sometimes see these\npeople swimming back and forth\nto Alcatraz and stuff like\nthat, which it seems risky.\nand they tell me it's very stimulating\nfor the mind and body.\nGreat.\nSometimes those people are very lean,\noftentimes they're not,\nand they're getting a\nlot of cold exposure.\nAnd one of the things that happens is,\nif you expose yourself\nto cold over and over,\nyou adapt,\nyou become cold adapted.\nAnd when you do that,\nyou no longer get the epinephrine,\nthe adrenaline release from the cold\nand therefore you don't\nget the succinate release\nand the shivering and the\nbrown fat thermogenic effect\nquite as intensely.\nSo if you want to use\ncold for other reasons,\nand certainly cold water swims can be fun.\nAnd there's, you know, long\nas you can do them safely,\nthey're great.\nI've gotten into cold water swimming\nfor some period of time.\nYou can use cold for\nresilience, et cetera.\nBut if you want to use\ncold to increase fat loss,\nthen getting this shiver\nprocess going the cooling\nand rewarming which\naccelerates the amount of,\nor increases the amount of shiver.\nThat's going to be the way to go.\nOne note about cold\nand some of the factors\nthat it releases.\nA few years back there\nwas a lot of excitement\nabout this hormone called\nirisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,\nwhich was associated with cold.\nAnd there was a lot of excitement\nabout its potential role\nin increasing metabolism\nso much so that people\nwere starting to explore\nthis as a potential fat loss drug.\nTo my knowledge that went nowhere.\nThe science eventually\nshifted over to succinate\nas the main factor in\ncold induced thermogenesis\nthrough this brown fat pathway.\nBut if anyone out there is aware\nof any positive effects of iricin\nor of any signs of irisin\nthat I'm overlooking here,\nor that I'm speaking about\nincorrectly, please let me know.\nI'd be very curious to learn.\nNow, I want to just talk about\nbrown fat a little bit more,\nand talk about a period in your life\nin which you were rich with brown fat,\nyou had a ton of brown fat,\nand that's when you were a baby.\nBabies can't shiver.\nThese neurons that release\nepinephrin into fat\nare not wired up and really aren't present\nat sufficient levels or\nin sufficient numbers\nwhen you are a baby.\nAnd therefore you can't shiver as a baby,\nand you can't warm yourself\nup in cold environments\nvery well.\nTo compensate for that,\nmother nature installed in all of us\nan excess of brown fat early in life\nthat exists again in the upper back,\nand the middle of the back\nand the back of the neck.\nOver time if we don't expose\nourselves to cold environments\nor do other things that make a shiver,\nwe lose a lot of that brown fat,\nbut what's interesting about brown fat\nis that there's some evidence\nthat brown fat just like white fat\ncan both increase in size,\nbut that you can also add new cells.\nNow, there's a little bit controversial.\nPeople always say you can't\nchange the number of fat cells,\nyou can just shrink them\nor increase their size.\nWell, it turns out that\nepinephrin released\nfrom these little nerve\nendings in brown fat\nand succinate circulating in the body may\nand I want to underscore\nmay have the effect\nof increasing the amount\nof brown fat cells\nprobably by converting these\nbeige fat cells into brown fat.\nSo that allows us to become\nmuch as we were early in life,\nwhere we metabolized like crazy\nand we'd heat ourselves\nup without shivering.\nSome people have taken the\ncold thing to the extreme,\nputting ice packs on\nthe back of their neck\nthroughout the day.\nDid a episode all about\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nand there's this, let's\njust call it a very niche,\nI have to imagine very,\nvery niche culture of people\nwho are wearing literally, I'm not joking.\nThey are these cool pack\nice pack underpants.\nThey go by a name that I'm\nnot going to repeat on here,\nbut you can find them on Amazon.\nThose are people that are\nusing cold packs on the body\nand on the groin to\ntry and increase things\nlike testosterone.\nBut as well to try and\nincrease thermogenesis\nand trying to increase their metabolism.\nJust remember if you become cold adapted,\nyou're not going to get\nthe fat burning effects\nto the same degree.\nSo cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,\nbut you don't want to adapt.\nThis is reminiscent of a rule\nthat you hear about in endurance exercise\nand in strength exercise as well,\nwhich is, that you want to use\nthe minimal effective stimulus\nto promote growth or progress.\nSo growth of a muscle or\nimprovements in endurance.\nIf you go 10% further\non a run or 10% faster,\nyou will likely see an\nimprovement in performance\nprovided your recovery the\nnext time you come back\nand do that same round of exercise.\nYou'll be able to do more work\nor complete the work\nmore easily, et cetera.\nYou've adapted.\nIf you do 20% more distance\nor 20% more weight,\nyou won't necessarily see the same\ncommiserate level of gain or improvement.\nAnd so likewise with cold,\nif you're quickly moving\nfrom 30 seconds of exposure\nto 10 minutes of exposure,\nyou're overlooking the opportunity\nto get the most fat loss\nand increase in metabolism\nby stepping it up\nin smaller increments.\nOkay?\nAnd this also speaks to the rationale\nfor using cold exposure\nto accelerate fat loss\nfor certain periods,\nbut then maybe not doing it year round.\nIf fat loss is your goal,\nmaybe use it for two,\nthree months at a time\nand then stop for two,\nthree months at a time,\nbecause it is such a potent stimulus\nprovided you engage in the shiver.\nNext I'd like to move to exercise\nand how particular timing\nand types of exercise can\nvastly improve fat loss.\nBefore I do that,\nI just want to mention a\nreally important reference\nfor those of you that are\ninterested in learning more about\nhow neurons connect to fat?\nThis is certainly a paper\nthat you'd want to look at,\nif you're interested in diving\ndeep into the literature\nand reading all the various studies.\nIt's a review.\nAnd the title of the review\nis neural innervation\nof white adipose tissue and\nthe control of lipolysis.\nThat's neural innervation\nof white adipose tissue\nand the control of lipolysis.\nIt was published in Frontiers\nin Neuroendocrinology.\nYou can find that free online.\nThey have the full text available.\nThe first author is\nBartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.\nIt's a great review.\nAnd I've talked about a number of things\nthat are mentioned in the review.\nFollow the references in that review\nand the reference trail as we say,\nif you're interested\nin learning more about\nalso how neurons control brown fat.\nAnd before I moved to exercise,\nI also just want to highlight something\nthat comes up every few years\nand has largely been considered myth now,\nbut that is actually more interesting\nthan most people might think,\nwhich is this issue of spot reduction.\nYou know, in the 80s and 90s,\nthere were a lot of commercials,\nlate night infomercials,\nwhere they would talk\nabout spot reduction.\nIf you do sit ups, will\nyou lose abdominal fat?\nIf you do hip raises or glute raises,\nwill you lose gluten hip fat.\nAnd I think everybody\nknows now believes that,\nand understands that fat metabolism\nis something that happens\nsystemically throughout the body.\nThat some body fat is\nquote unquote more stubborn\nthan others.\nEveryone varies in where\nthey tend to store fat\nor lose fat last.\nNumber of factors that influence that,\nand in particular hormone receptors.\nBut now at least in the\nscientific literature,\nspot reduction and the possibility of real\ntrue spot reduction reductions\nin fat in a targeted way,\na body part or body area targeted way\nis becoming more of a reality\nand may be a reality soon,\nbecause exercise that\ntriggers the activation\nof these nerve fibers,\nthese neurons that innervate fat.\nIn theory, if you can increase\nthe amount of epinephrin\nreleased at those particular\nfat pads as they're called,\nthey're actually called fat pads\nin the scientific literature.\nIn theory, you could increase mobilization\nfrom those particular body fat sites.\nOkay?\nSo because the new view that\nthe modern understanding\nis that it's not adrenaline\nreleased systemically\nkind of bathing all your fat tissue,\nbut rather its neurons\nreleasing adrenaline\nepinephrin locally that in theory,\nexercise that stimulates\nthe release of epinephrin\nor exercise coupled\nwith things like shiver\nor low grade shaking movement,\nor the NEAT, the non-exercise\nactivity thermogenesis\ncould in theory lead to local enhancement\nof mobilization of fat tissue.\nSo I think that spot reduction\nactually will soon be\nsomething that's possible\nusing the appropriate technology.\nWhat does this mean for you now?\nWhat could you possibly do\nwith this information now?\nWell, I think it speaks to the fact\nthat if one is going to engage in exercise\nthat doing exercises that involve\nlots of different body parts and movements\nis likely to encourage the maintenance\nand or growth of these neurons\nthat innervate fat throughout the body.\nWhat this means is changing\nup the pattern of exercise,\nengaging in novel types of movements\nmay actually be one\nway that one can access\nthese so-called stubborn body fat pads.\nNow, there's a little bit of speculation\nin the statement that I'm making,\nbut if you think about it it makes sense.\nIf you become very adapted\nto a particular pattern\nof exercise,\nwhether or not you're subcaloric or not,\nyou're on maintenance calories are not,\nyou are oxidizing some fat always,\nand you're utilizing the\nneurons that innervate fat\nin a regular way.\nAnd pretty soon this innervation\nis going to shut off,\nbecause there's no reason why\nthis neural innervation of fat\nshould continue to release epinephrin\nunless you give it a\nstrong stimulus like cold\nor the fidgeting or in this case\nto do novel forms of exercise.\nAnd there's some anecdotal evidence\nand I don't even want to call it data,\nbut anecdotal evidence\nthat people who have,\nquote on quote stubborn body fat,\nif they start to adopt\nnew patterns of exercise,\nthey can start to access\nthose stubborn fat pads.\nAnd again, fat pads is the correct way\nto refer to these in the\nscientific literature.\nSo what we're focusing\non today is the fact\nthat fat indeed will be\nmobilized and oxidized\nin response to a deficit in calories.\nBut that the way that neurons\ncontrol those fat pads\nand those body fat stores,\naffords you a lot more control\nthan perhaps you ever previously thought.\nSo let's talk about movement.\nAnd the more traditional\nkinds of movement,\naka exercise has been\nshown to lead to increases\nin metabolism and fat\nloss to greater degrees\ndepending on whether or not for,\ninstance you're fasted\nwhen you do it or not,\nwhether or not you do your cardio first\nor your resistance training first.\nAnd this is again in the literature\nfor which there's a lot of controversy,\nbut in digging through\nall the studies on this,\nwe're finally starting to\narrive at a consensus of,\nwhen is best to do exercise?\nAnd what types of exercise to\ndo if your goal is fat loss?\nThe topic of exercise is a\nkind of controversial one,\nnot as controversial as nutrition and diet\nwhich we will talk about in a few minutes.\nBut it's a particularly interesting one,\nbecause different types\nof exercising gauge\nthe musculature of the body\nand the heart and the lungs\nin different ways,\nand can have vastly\ndifferent effects on things\nlike hormones and metabolism\ndepending on whether\nor not it's of high intensity,\nmoderate intensity or low intensity.\nSo rather than think about weight training\nversus cardiovascular exercise,\nI think the most simple way,\nthe most fluid way to have this\nconversation about exercise\nand fat loss is in terms of\nthree general types of training.\nWhether or not it's done\nwith weights or body weight\ndoesn't really matter.\nAnd those are high\nintensity interval training.\nSomething that's seems to have\ngained a lot of popularity\nin recent years.\nSo-called HITT, H-I-I-T.\nSo high intensity interval training.\nSprint interval training.\nSo that's going to be very\nhigh intensity or SIT,\nor moderate intensity\ncontinuous training, M-I-C-T.\nSo we've got HIIT, SIT and MICT, M-I-C-T.\nAnd we can get a little bit\nmore precise if you'd like.\nI'm not somebody who measures\nmy VO2 max or anything\nwhile I exercise.\nI generally know whether\nor not I'm doing something\nI could continue for a very long time,\nor whether or not I'm doing something\nthat I realize is going\nto be of short duration\nhigh-intensity.\nBut if you'd like to\nmap this to VO2 max SIT,\nthis sprint interval training was defined\nas all out greater than 100% of VO2 max\nbursts of activity that\nlasts eight to 30 seconds\nintersperse with less\nintense recovery periods.\nSo this would be sprinting downfield\nfor eight to 30 seconds,\nthen maybe walking back\nfor about a minute or two\nand then sprinting again\nand then continuing.\nSo that would be SIT.\nHIIT, H-I-I-T is defined as submaximal,\nso 80 to a hundred percent\nof VO2 max bursts of activity\nthat lasts 60 to 240 seconds\nintersperse with less\nintense recovery periods.\nSo on a standard 400 meter track,\njust to give this a\nlittle bit of a visual,\na four minute mile would be\nfantastic for most people,\nalthough people run faster\nthan that of course.\nSo that's four 60 seconds laps,\nbut that's back to back to back.\nI think in my best shape or\nmaybe it was in my dreams,\nI don't recall which I\nwas able to do 60 seconds\naround the track,\nbut of course I couldn't\nget that on the second\nor third or fourth if I\ndid that was certainly\nin the fantasy land and not reality.\nBut 60 seconds would\nbe about one revolution\naround the track,\nmaybe 90 seconds, depending\non how fast a one is running.\nSo 60 to 240 seconds.\nMICT okay.\nThis moderate intensity\ncontinuous training\nis steady state cardio\nsometimes called Zone 2 cardio\nthese days on the internet,\nwhich has performed continuously\nfor 20 to 60 minutes\nat moderate intensity\nof 40 to 60% of VO2 max\nor if you prefer heart rate\n55 to 70% of max heart rate.\nOkay?\nSo we can think about high, medium\nand low intensity exercise.\nAlthough low intensity usually means\nthat you could carry on a conversation,\nor maybe you have to gasp\nevery few steps or so,\nwhile trying to talk and run.\nThat's I think going to\nbe the most useful way\nto have this conversation\nthat we're having now,\nbecause there's so many\ndifferent forms of exercise\nthat people do and intensity is important.\nLet's ask the question\nthat I think many people\nare wondering about,\nwhich is, is it better?\nMeaning do you burn more fat\nif you do your exercise fasted?\nAnd fasted in this respect\ncould be that you wake up\nin the morning,\nyou've been fasting all night,\nyou just hydrate and you exercise\nor sometimes people will ingest caffeine,\nthere's controversy as to whether\nor not that quote on quote\nbreaks the fast.\nIt has to do with whether\nor not your caffeine adapted\nsomething for another episode.\nIn any case that would be fasted.\nSo probably not having eaten anything\nfor anywhere from three to\n24 hours or maybe even more.\nAs you could also be\nfasted in the afternoon.\nIf you had lunch at noon and it's four\nor five or 6:00 p.m.\nIs it, will you burn more fat\nif you exercise without\nan eating anything first,\nwithout ingesting any calories first?\nAnd people have tried to\nreally split hairs on this,\nevery which way people say,\nwell, you can fat fast,\nbecause fat and protein doesn't lead\nto as great increases in\ninsulin as other things,\nmaybe you can have a few\nalmonds and then still train.\nAnd indeed insulin will\nprevent fat oxidation.\nI want to be really clear.\nThe burning part of fat in the cell,\nthe movement of the fatty\nacid and into mitochondria\nand the conversion ATP,\ninsulin inhibits that process.\nHowever, it's been shown\nthat it least for short\nperiods of training,\nit doesn't really seem to\nmatter whether or not you eat\nbefore training or you don't,\nif your goal is fat oxidation.\nNow, I want to put an asterix near that,\nbecause there are some exceptions.\nBut there were several studies done that,\nand the kind of the classic ones of these,\nI'll read out to you.\nWhat they basically did is they\ngave people glucose, sugar,\nto increase their blood\nsugar before training or not.\nAnd the kind of classic study\nof this is Al Borg at all.\nSo in 1976, so it goes way back,\nwhich is that glucose reduces\nfat burning and exercise.\nAnd then some other studies\nif you want to look these up,\nthey're very easy to find on PubMed.\nYou put in Horowitz 1999,\n[indistinct] is another\none where they have people\ndrink milk with glucose in it.\nSo sweet sugary milk\nbefore exercise, et cetera.\nAnd you can find a number of examples\nwhere eating before exercise\nreduces the amount of fat\nthat's oxidized during the exercise.\nAnd you can also find a lot\nof studies showing that,\neating during exercise\nor prior to exercise\nwill not reduce the amount\nof fat that is oxidized.\nHowever, the types of exercise\nwhether I was medium\nintensity or high intensity\nor low intensity is all over\nthe map for these studies.\nSo it's very hard to\ntarget an ideal protocol.\nAnd then if you look really\ndeep in the literature,\nyou start to find meta analysis\nwhere people have actually\naggregated all the findings\nand some modern studies where it points\nto some very specific\nand useful protocols.\nAnd so here's the rule\nthat or the protocol\nthat I extracted from that literature.\nAt a period of about 90 minutes\nof moderate intensity exercise,\nI want to be clear,\nat about or after 90 minutes\nof moderate intensity exercise.\nThere's a switchover point\nwhereby if you ate before the exercise,\nyou will reduce, excuse me,\nyou will burn far less fat\nfrom the 90 minute point onward\nthan you would if you had\ngone into the training fasted.\nSo let me repeat that.\nIf it's moderate intensity,\nso-called zone two cardio type exercise,\nat the 90 minute point,\nif you happen to have\neaten before the exercise\nwithin one to three hours\nprior to the exercise,\nthen you reduce the amount\nof fat that you will burn\nfrom 90 minutes onward,\nwhereas if you had fasted\nprior to the exercise,\nyou hadn't eaten anything\nfor three hours or more prior\nto the exercise.\nAt the 90 minute point,\n90 minutes of exercise\nyou will start to burn\nmore fat than you would\nhad you eaten.\nNow, 90 minutes of moderate\nintensity exercises is a lot.\nSo that's a pretty long run.\nEven if you're running\nat a pretty slow pace\nlike a 10 or 12 minute mile,\nthat's a lot of running,\nthat's a lot of swimming.\nSo that's a lot of walking,\nthat's a lot of hiking.\nHowever, there are people who\nare going out hiking all day\nor running all day or walking all day.\nAnd if you want to burn\nmore fat per unit time,\nyou want to oxidize more fat\nthen you would do that fasted.\nNow, there are also studies\nthat pointed the fact\nthat you don't have to wait to 90 minutes\nin order to get this\nenhanced fat burning effect.\nThe studies I was able to find\nand that looked to me like\nquality peer-reviewed studies\nwith no company bias or no\nproduct bias of any kind.\nThese are studies that were largely funded\nby the federal government\nin the university context\npointed the fact that if one\ndoes high-intensity training,\nor even the very high\nintensity forms of training\nlike sprints or squats or deadlifts\nor any kind of activity\nthat can't be maintained\nfor more than these, you know, eight\nor I would say up to 60 seconds.\nSo a set of lifting\nweights repeated, repeated,\nif that's done for\nanywhere from 20 minutes,\nso weight training or power lifting\nor these kinds of things\nor kettlebell swings\nor up to 60 minutes,\nwe'll then the switchover point\nin which you can burn more fat,\nif you go into that fasted comes earlier.\nAnd this makes sense\nbecause there's nothing holy\nabout the 90 minute point\nfor a medium intensity\nZone 2 cardio.\nThat 90 minute point is the point\nin which the body shifts over\nfrom mainly burning glycogen,\nbasically, sugar that comes\nfrom muscles or the liver\nand realizes this is going on for a while,\nI'm going to shift over\nto a storage site fuel\nthat is in reserve like body fat.\nThis is going to happen for a while,\nso I'm going to start\ntapping into body fat stores.\nNow, fat doesn't have\na little brain there.\nIt is innervated by neurons,\nbut it doesn't have thoughts.\nAnd you don't actually control\nthis switch with your mind.\nThis is something that\nhas to do with the milieu\nof various hormones.\nWhat has to happen is insulin\nhas to go down far enough.\nSo if you ate before the exercise,\nyou'd have an increase in insulin,\nif you ate carbohydrates\nyou'd have a bigger increase\nin insulin, fat and proteins\nindeed you'll have\nlower amounts of insulin\nand fasting will give you\nthe lowest amount of insulin.\nWell, then that switch over\npoint is going to come earlier\nin the exercise.\nAnd if you think about if\nyou were to do something\nhigh intensity for 20, 30, 40 minutes,\nso maybe lift weights and\nthen get into Zone 2 cardio.\nIf you are fasted, the literature says\nthat you're going to burn\nmore body fat per unit time\nthan if you had eaten before\nor during the exercise.\nSo what does this mean?\nThis means if you want\nto burn more body fat,\nif it's in your protocols\nand you have been approved\nto do this safely,\nexercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes,\nthe higher the intensity\nobviously the shorter\nthat about is going to be,\nand then move over into Zone 2 cardio.\nAnd if you do that fasted or\nthe medium intensity cardio\nI should say.\nAnd if you do that fasted,\nthen indeed you will burn a\nhigher percentage of body fat.\nIf you need to eat or you\nlike to eat before you train\nthat also can work.\nAnd if you train very intensely,\nyou're likely to shift over\nto the fat burning pattern\nmore quickly as well.\nSo again, this isn't really an issue\nof how long you exercise.\nIt's an issue of how\nintensely you exercise\nand therefore what fuel\nsource you're drawing from.\nSo hopefully I've made that clear,\nbut basically you need to deplete glycogen\nor through high intensity exercise\nand then move to a steady state exercise\nthat will allow you to burn more fat.\nOr you need to perform a medium intensity\nor low intensity type exercise\nfor a long period of time\nbefore you shift over to burning fat.\nAnd indeed it seems that\ngoing into all that fasted\nwill facilitate the burning\nof more fat overall.\nBut if you can't even get to the exercise,\nif you're somebody who just\ncan't do the training at all,\nyou're unwilling to or\nyou're incapable of training,\nunless you eat something,\nthen obviously eating\nsomething makes the most sense.\nAnd what you eat prior to exercise,\nthat's a whole other biz\nthat people argue about\nand fight about whether\nor not you should go\ninto it with low carbohydrates\nor higher carbs, all of that.\nBut in general, the theme\nthere is very simple.\nWhich is that you want insulin\nlevels to be pretty low\nif your goal is body fat reduction,\nif you want to oxidize body fat.\nSo fasting in some cases,\nfat fasting and other cases\nwhere you're just ingesting fats.\nFat and protein, in some\ncases or for some people\nit will be eating carbohydrates.\nI'm not here to dictate a\nparticular nutrition regimen.\nThat's just how the hormone\nbalance of these things\nand fat oxidation works.\nNow, one thing that's very interesting\nand cannot be overlooked is this issue\nof how much energy you burn\nduring and after the activity.\nAnd some of you probably\nalready know about this,\nbut the whole business of\ncalories in versus calories out,\nand people counting the number of calories\nthey burn during their aerobic session\nor during their whatever session\nis only one half of the equation\nand it really eclipses\nthe more important issue,\nwhich is how much of an\nincrease in metabolism\ndoes a given exercise\ncreate after the exercise?\nAnd we could talk for hours about this,\nbut the simple way to view this is that,\nhigh intensity training,\nanaerobic training\nof weight training, sprints,\nburpees, any kind of thing.\nI don't know these days I\nhear that you're not supposed\nto do burpees that people\nthink burpees are dangerous.\nSo I'm not suggesting any\nparticular movements here.\nYou have to decide what's right for you.\nI do burpees.\nI don't seem to be injured from them,\nbut I hear that they're\nterrible for some people.\nSo anyway, push-ups, sit-ups,\nwhatever it happens to be\nthat anaerobic exercise\nthat's of higher intensity or sprints\ntaps into glycogen stores\nduring the movement\nand we'll burn more energy per unit time\nthan moderate intensity.\nHigh intensity burns more\nthan modern intensity.\nThat's straightforward.\nWhat's interesting is that all the studies\nthat I was able to find on what happens\nafter that type of exercise showed\nthat the percentage of fat that you burn\nafter high intensity\nexercise is actually greater.\nIn other words, you burn a lot of glycogen\nduring the high intensity exercise.\nAnd then after the exercise,\nthe post exercise oxygen consumption\nas it sometimes called goes up.\nWe know this after you train intensely\nthat post exercise oxygen\nconsumption goes up\nsometimes for up to 24 hours.\nAnd it is during that period of time\nthat you oxidize more fat not glycogen.\nNow, what's interesting is\nthat the reverse is also true,\nfor people that do long bouts of low\nor moderate intensity exercise.\nSo typically this would\nbe things like running,\nswimming, biking, et cetera.\nSo 60, 90 minutes, two hours\nmaybe even people that\nare training for marathons\nor half marathons,\nwhen they stop training,\nthey burn more glycogen,\nmore carbohydrate,\neven though they were burning\nmore body fat per unit time\nduring the low intensity exercise.\nSo there's this kind of inversion.\nHigh-intensity burns more\nglycogen during the activity,\nmore body fat afterwards.\nModerate to low intensity\nburns more percentage-wise\nmore body fat is oxidized than glycogen\nduring the actual exercise\nafterward it's more glycogen.\nSo I don't want this\nto get too complicated.\nThe point is you should\npick exercise that you like,\nthat you're going to do regularly,\nbut it does seem that the\nhigh intensity exercise\nfollowed by moderate intensity exercise\nis going to be optimal\nfor fat burning overall.\nBecause when you look at the\npercentage of body fat burned,\nand you look at the overall increase\nin basal metabolic rate,\nmoderate and high intensity training\nfollowed by low intensity training\nor even just followed\nby going back into life\nis going to be the best way\nto continue to burn body fat\nbecause of the ways that it\nincreases basal metabolic rate.\nThis could be distilled\ninto a simple protocol\nwhereby three or four times a week\nyou do high intensity training\nfollowed by either nothing\nor followed by low intensity training\nespecially if you're\nable to do that fasted.\nAnd I should just mention\nthat none of this stuff\nabout fasted is about performance.\nIf you want to perform really well,\nthis is for reasons of performance\nand you want to, you know, it's\nfor a sport or a competition,\nit's not for body fat purposes.\nWell, then all of this kind of falls away\nand is modified by what's\nideal to eat for performance.\nBut what we're talking about today\nis how to optimize body fat loss.\nSo train moderately to very high intensity\nand then moderate to low intensity,\nor train moderate to high intensity,\nand then go about life.\nAnd in fact, I have a friend\nwho uses this strategy.\nHe likes the train intensely\nand not that often protocol\ncause he's a very busy person.\nSo he'll train for 20\nor 30 minutes intensely\nwith weights or just body\nweight movement doing a lot,\nhe does burpees and push-ups\nand sit-ups and pull-ups\nand just kind of moving and\nkind of circuit type training.\nBut where he's breathing really hard,\nthe goal he always says is,\nI want to breathe hard\nfor 30 minutes every day.\nAnd then afterwards he\nhydrates and drinks coffee\nand moves into his day.\nAnd he's walking around and taking calls\nand carrying around his children\nand doing all these kinds of things\nthat keep him really busy\nwhich is kind of like low intensity work.\nSo I think you get the principle now.\nBut you should all be asking yourselves\nas scientists of yourselves.\nWhy would it be that\ncertain patterns of exercise\nwould lead to more or less fat loss?\nI mean, it can't just be\nabout the energy burn.\nWe already established that.\nAnd again, it has to do with the neurons.\nIt has to do with how we\nengage the nervous system.\nSo while non-exercise activity\ninduced thermogenesis, NEAT,\nthe fidgeting and cold\ncan induce thermogenesis\nby engaging shiver tight\nmovement or low-level movements.\nBig movements that are\nof very high intensity,\nmeaning they require a lot of effort,\ndeploy a lot of adrenaline\nepinephrin from our neurons\nand signal particular types\nand amounts of fat\nthermogenesis, fat oxidation,\nwhereas low level intensity exercise,\nlow or moderate intensity exercise,\nwalking, running, biking\nwhere you can do that easily,\nthere's not very much adrenaline release.\nSo adrenaline aka epinephrin\nis really the final common path\nby which movement of any kind,\nwhether or not it's low level shiver,\nwhether or not it's lifting\na barbell sprinting up a hill\nor doing a long bike ride.\nAdrenaline is the effector of fat loss.\nIt's the trigger end, it's the effector.\nSo now I want to turn our\nattention to compounds\nthat increase epinephrin and adrenaline,\nas well as compounds that work outside\nthe adrenaline epinephrin pathway\nto increase the rates of fat loss.\nI almost always save\ncompounds and supplements\nand things of that sort to the end,\nbecause I do believe that\npeople should look first\ntowards behavioral tools and\nan understanding of the science\nbefore they look toward a supplement\nor a particular thing that\nthey can extract from diet.\nThis is mainly to try\nand shift people away\nfrom the kind of magic\npill phenomenon or the idea\nthat there is a magic pill\nbecause there really isn't.\nAnd frankly, there never will be.\nBut there are some compounds\nthat can greatly increase fat\noxidation and mobilization.\nAnd understanding which\ncompounds increase oxidation\nor mobilization can be very useful\nif your goal is to accelerate fat loss.\nThere are things that people can ingest\nthat will allow them to oxidize more fat.\nAnd that occurs mainly\nby increasing the amount\nof epinephrin that is\nreleased from neurons\nthat innovate fat tissue.\nOne of the more common ones is one\nthat you may already be\nusing which is caffeine.\nIt's well-established that\ncaffeine can enhance performance,\nif you're caffeine adapted.\nI talked about this in an earlier episode\nso I want to make sure\nI'm very clear about this.\nIf you are not used to drinking caffeine\nand you suddenly decide I'm going to drink\na big cup of coffee before training,\nyou will vasoconstrict and\nyou will limit performance.\nSo that's performance.\nIf you're caffeine adapted however,\nthere's this kind of\ninteresting phenomenon\nwhere ingestion of caffeine\nserves more as a performance enhancer,\nboth by increasing alertness,\nbut also by way of dilating vasculature\nof allowing more blood flow.\nNow, caffeine for burning\nmore fat for oxidizing\nand mobilizing more fat\nis an interesting one.\nIt can be effective at\ndosages up to 400 milligrams.\nYou have to be careful if\nyou're caffeine sensitive.\nSome people have just the\nlittlest bit of caffeine\nand their mind goes crazy,\nand they're very uncomfortable.\nIt can have cardiovascular\neffects for some people\nor hypertension, et cetera.\nSo please check with your doctor.\nBut 400 milligrams is roughly\na cup and a half a coffee\nor two cups of coffee.\nNowadays, there's a lot\nmore caffeine in coffee.\nSo if you go to a typical cafe\nand you were to get their medium-sized\nthat would have close\nto a gram of caffeine,\nwhich is why, if you're a\nregular caffeine consumer\nand you don't get that gram of caffeine\nin your coffee each day,\nyou will get a headache.\nIt can cause constriction\nand dilation of blood vessels\nin ways that's complicated,\nbut you'll get a headache.\nSome people like the\nway they feel drinking\n100 to 200, 300 maybe 400\nmilligrams of caffeine\nbefore training.\nAnd indeed that will lead\nto increase fat oxidation.\nIt will do that because you\nwill release more epinephrin\nand adrenaline.\nSo let's just place this in the context\nof what we said previously.\nLet's say you normally do Zone 2 cardio,\nso you're going out for\na moderately intense run\nfor 30 to 60 minutes or so.\nI think the current recommendation\nguidelines in the States\nare that people engage in 30 minutes\nof moderate intensity\nexercise five days a week\nfor that's 150 minutes.\nIf their goal is to improve\nor maintain health of the\ncardiovascular system.\n80% of people in the United\nStates fail to do that,\nor anything close to it.\nWe are way below threshold\nfor what the government\nhas recommended.\nIn this case, the\ngovernment recommendations,\nI think are pretty good.\nThat's one could always\ndo better of course.\nBut 80% of people aren't even doing that.\nHowever, just using the logic\nand the understanding of\nhow epinephrin adrenaline\nis affecting this fat oxidation process.\nIf you were to go out for 15 minutes\nand you drank caffeine before you went,\nyes, you'll probably oxidize\nmore fat per unit time.\nCan you compensate for the exercise\nyou're not doing just\nby drinking caffeine?\nWell, probably if you were\njust talking about fat loss,\nif that caffeine makes\nyou fidget a lot, right?\nThe amount of calories that\nyou burn in a 30 minute run,\nunless the run is very intense\nand you're wearing a weight\nvest and it's up a hill,\nit's not that great, right?\nThen you probably get you in somewhere\ninto the 400, 500 calories burned area.\nBut I said earlier, and\nthere are a lot of data now\nto support that fidgeting for a day\ncan burn anywhere from 800\nto 2,500 calories a day.\nSo you might say, well,\nfidgeting is better than running,\nah, but it doesn't trigger the activation\nand the positive health effects\nof the cardiovascular system.\nSo fidgeting alone can be great,\nbut you need exercise for other reasons.\nCaffeine can enhance the amount of fat\nthat you burn in any duration of exercise.\nAnd it can shift the percentage of fat\nthat you oxidize compared to glycogen.\nUnless you take that caffeine\nand it ramps you up so much\nthat you're training\nreally, really intensely.\nThe bottom line is,\nif you like caffeine and\nyou can use it safely,\ningesting somewhere between\n104 milligrams of caffeine\nprior to exercise somewhere\nbetween 30 to 40 minutes\nbefore exercise can be beneficial\nif we're talking about fat\noxidation burning more body fat.\nSo that's caffeine.\nThere are a number of other things\nthat have existed over the\nyears that are in this pathway,\nthings like ephedrine which\nis now illegal in most states,\nI think maybe an all states\nbecause people were dropping\ndead from taking ephedrine,\nbecause they were heating up too much.\nIt's interesting it wasn't\ndirect effects on the heart\ncausing heart attack.\nIt could trigger by way\nof adrenergic receptors.\nIf you'd like to know,\nincreases in body temperature and heat.\nNow, those drugs turned\nout to be dangerous,\nbecause people were overheating and dying.\nThere was also the big Fen-Phen craze.\nThat was a drug that was\nreleased fenfluramine\nwhich actually was quite effective\nas an anti obesity drug,\na treatment for obesity that\nhad to be outlawed as well.\nIt was FDA approval was removed\nbecause again people were dying\nbecause of cardiovascular effects.\nI don't know if people were\noverheating on it as well.\nSo what is the solution?\nIf caffeine is the kind of the\nentry point for most people\nof using compounds to increase the rate\nor percentage of fat loss in\nexercise and even at rest,\nwhat are some of the other\nthings that are useful\nand interesting?\nWell, in terms of tools\nthat are actionable\nand have reasonable safety margins,\nI've talked before about\nsomething called GLP-1.\nThis is something that can be triggered\nby the ingestion of yerba\nmate, which is a tea,\nand I guess because I'm half Argentine,\nwe grew up drinking mate.\nI think I was drinking mate from the time\nI was about three or four years old.\nI don't suggest that for kids.\nI don't think kids should\nbe ingesting caffeine.\nBut anyway I did it and\nI still ingest mate.\nMate increases GLP-1.\nGLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.\nSo let's just quickly\nreturn to our biochemistry.\nAs you recall, fat is\nmobilized from body fat stores\nand then it's burned up.\nIt's oxidized in cells.\nIt actually needs to\nbe converted into ATP.\nAnd those fatty acids are\nessentially converted into ATP\nin the mitochondria of the cell.\nHigh insulin prevents that from happening\nand glucagon facilitates that process.\nGlucagon facilitates that process\nthrough increases in GLP-1.\nThe short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1\nand yes, increases the percentage\nof fat that you will burn.\nIt increases fat burning.\nAnd that is especially true,\nit turns out from the\nscientific literature,\nif you ingest mate prior\nto exercise of any kind.\nSo if you want to burn\nmore fat drinking mate\nbefore exercise is good.\nDrinking it at rest when\nyou're not exercising\nwill also help shift your metabolism\ntoward enhanced burning of fat\nby increasing fat oxidation.\nNow, there's a whole\ncategory of pharmaceuticals\nthat's being developed right now\nthat are in late stage trials\nor are in use for the\ntreatment of diabetes\nwhich capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.\nThey go by various names\nand there are people on the internet\nwho are selling these things.\nThey are prescription drugs\nand I want to emphasize that\nthey are prescription drugs\nand you obviously wouldn't want to use\nany of these without a\nprescription and a requirement.\nIt does seem that they are effective\nfor the treatment of\ncertain kinds of diabetes\nand lead to fairly significant weight loss\nand reduction in appetite.\nSo this is kind of the\nmodern version of GLP-1\nis pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism\nare drugs such as somatical,\nI can never pronounce this.\nI can't seem to pronounce\nmany things it seems.\nSemaglutide is the way\nI would pronounce it.\nS-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.\nSemaglutide but that's not\nthe way you pronounce it.\nBut Semaglutide is the way\nthat it's been described\non the internet.\nIn any case, this\ncompound increases GLP-1.\nIt's actually a GLP-1\nanalog in some cases,\nand they go by various\ntypes of trade names.\nSo the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.\nMost people, including myself,\nare not interested in\ntaking a prescription drug\nto increase GLP-1,\nI do it through the ingestion of mate.\nI just get the mate leaves,\npour water over it and drink it.\nWhat's kind of interesting,\nthat's not often discussed\nis that you can increase\nthe amount of GLP-1 by,\nyou can essentially reuse the tea.\nThe first time you drink it\nit can be very, very intense.\nAnd in fact, some people find that mate\nalmost tastes like burnt leaves.\nIt's too intense.\nYou don't want the water to be too hot.\nBut I learned this trick from a friend.\nYou can reuse the leaves\nover and over again,\nprobably for about a\nday before they go bad.\nAnd in doing that, you start\nto extract more and more\nof the compounds from the mate\nleaf that increased GLP-1.\nSo it's kind of cool.\nYou can kind of get an increased effect.\nSo what I'll typically do is\nmake a about 16 to 30 ounces\nand just sip it throughout the day,\nand I do like it before I train.\nSome people who don't like mate\nmight prefer something like guayusa,\nwhich is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.\nG-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa\nwhich is from Ecuador,\ndespite the USA ending to it.\nIt's from Ecuador.\nAnd it's a sweeter tasting tea.\nIt doesn't have any sweetener in it,\nbut the leaf of the\nguayusa plant is sweeter\nthan the mate plant.\nI sometimes will mix the two\nand then make the tea with that.\nThere's no mate or guayusa\nsponsor of the podcast.\nThese are just tools to increase\nGLP-1 and fat oxidation.\nAnd again, the Semaglutide\nis the prescription version\nof the that's kind of the heavy\nartillery GLP-1 stimulant,\nand again should be only\nexplored with a prescription.\nSo those are the compounds\nthat really increase\nfat oxidation directly.\nThere are going to be a number\nof things that impact insulin\nand glucagon that are\ngoing to shift the body\ntoward more fat burning.\nWe talked about a lot of\nthese during the episode\non hormones.\nWe talked about it.\nWe did a whole episode on\nhormones and metabolism.\nAnd so for instance, berberine,\nwhich comes from a plant\nor metformin are compounds\nthat are now in kind of growing use\nfor reducing blood glucose.\nThey are very potent at\nreducing blood glucose,\nwhich will reduce insulin because the job\nof the hormone insulin is to\nessentially manage glucose\nin the bloodstream.\nSo there are a huge gallery of compounds\nthat will reduce insulin\nand thereby can increase fat oxidation.\nAnd that's because, as I mentioned before,\nfat oxidation, this conversion\nof fatty acids into ATP\nin the mitochondria is\ninhibited by insulin.\nSo if you keep insulin low,\nyou're going to increase that process.\nWhich brings us full circle back\nto the issue of diet and nutrition.\nThere is really solid\nevidence from the Gardner Lab\nat Stanford and from\nother labs showing that,\nwhen you look at different diets,\nyou look at low fat diets,\nhigh fat diets,\nketo diets, intermittent fasting,\nprovided people stick to\ntheir particular diet,\nit doesn't really matter\nwhich diet you follow.\nYou can still get a caloric deficit\nand you get weight loss.\nAdherence however is always an issue.\nAnd so what I always say is,\nthat you want to use the eating plan\nthat is obviously\nbeneficial to your health,\nbut the one that allows you to adhere\nto whatever it is that the\nparticular nutrition protocol is,\nright?\nIf you can't stick with something,\nthen it's not very worthwhile.\nBut from the purely scientific standpoint,\nthere's also an advantage\nto keeping insulin low.\nNow, that doesn't necessarily mean\nyou go to zero carbohydrate.\nI've talked before about\nmy preferred way of eating\nis to go lower or no\ncarbohydrates throughout the day\nfor alertness to get that\nadrenaline release and the focus\nthat goes with it, et cetera,\nand the ability to think and move\nand do all the things I\nneed to do during the day.\nAnd then I eat carbohydrates at night\n'cause it facilitates\nthe transition to sleep.\nThat's what works for me.\nBut when insulin is low,\nyou do place your system in a\nposition to oxidize more fat.\nAnd so that's why I think a\nlot of people do see benefit\nfrom lower carbohydrate or\nmoderate carbohydrate diets,\nbecause when insulin is low,\nyou are in a position to oxidize more fat.\nBoth from exercise and at rest.\nAnd I should mention,\nbecause I often mention\nand it's appropriate to mention\nthat if you're interested\nin looking at the effects\nof caffeine, of mate,\nguayusa things of that sort,\nGLP-1 you want to learn more about those.\nYou can go to this wonderful website\nwhich is free www.examine.com.\nYou can put in yerba mate,\nit will describe the three studies\nthat show increased fat oxidation,\nboth during exercise and at rest,\nand as a consequence not\nsurprisingly and increase\nin metabolic rate.\nOne thing that's interesting about mate\nis it causes a slight\ndecrease in heart rate\nfor reasons that still escape me.\nThere's a single study showing\nthat heart rate is slightly reduced\nwhich is kind of nice because if,\nwhen I drink too much caffeine\nmy heart rate goes up,\nmaybe that would increase my\nfidgeting and my fat burning,\nbut I don't like the feeling\nof having my basal heart rate\nbeing up too high.\nI like my heart rate\nelevate during exercise,\nbut not when I'm just kind of resting\nor working and throughout the day.\nAnd for some reason\nthat I don't understand\nthere's an effect of mate\nof increasing fat oxidation\nbut reducing heart rate just slightly.\nSo that's interesting.\nAnd it probably lends itself [indistinct]\nexplains the subjective experience\nthat I've had of that mate\nhas kind of a little nice\neven mellow stimulant.\nIt's not this really supercharged\nstimulant like caffeine\nfrom coffee or other sources.\nAlthough if you drink too much mate\nit will also make you jittery.\nAnd there's one more compound\nthat I think we should discuss\nin terms of increasing fat loss,\nand that's carnitine\nor acetyl-L-carnitine,\nthey lie in the same pathway.\nWe can return to our basic\nknowledge now of fat mobilization\nand oxidation.\nAfter fat is mobilized\nand makes it into cells\nand needs to be oxidized.\nSo the literally the burning of fat\nand conversion of it into energy\nthat is accomplished and is facilitated\nby the presence of\nglucagon being elevated,\nGLP increases that process\nand insulin being low.\nAnd we talked about some\nways to manage insulin\nboth in this episode\nand in previous episode.\nL-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine\nin particular facilitates fat oxidation.\nIt helps convert fatty acids into ATP.\nAnd indeed supplementing\nL-carnitine can increase fat loss.\nThat's been shown.\nAt what dosages?\nWell, people ingest\nanywhere from 500 milligrams\nto two grams per day in\ndivided doses typically.\nSome people who are really extreme\nare taking injectable L-carnitine,\nI've certainly not tried that.\nI confess I have used it in\npill form from time to time\nbut in part, because of\nthe fat oxidation effects,\nbut also because of the other\neffects that it tends to have.\nSo in exploring the effects\nthat acetyl-L-carnitine has,\nit has a huge variety of\neffects on cellar metabolism.\nIt can reduce ammonia in the blood\nthat is actually a quite strong effect.\nIt can reduce things\nlike C-reactive protein,\nwhich is you want to\nC-reactive protein levels\nto be managed.\nYou do not want them too high.\nCan slightly reduce blood glucose.\nI can slightly increase HDLC,\nthe good form of the blood lipid\nand slightly reduce overall cholesterol.\nAnd as I mentioned, it can slightly modify\nthe pathway involving glucagon,\nsuch that you get a considerable effect,\nnot a huge effect on fat oxidation,\nso it can improve pat oxidation rates.\nIt has a number of other effects,\nsome of which I talked\nduring the month on hormones\nand that sort of thing.\nIt has strong effects\non rates of pregnancy\nand sperm quality.\nSo clearly carnitine is doing\nlots of different things\nand lots of different cells.\nIt's impacting sperm motility.\nThey're in a large number\nof studies supporting that.\nSlight reductions in blood pressure\nand has these interesting\neffects on reducing fatigue\nduring exercise,\nreducing inflammatory\nmarkers like interleukin 6.\nSo it has a number of\neffects that on the whole\nare quote unquote positive\nor at least in the direction\nof things that you may want.\nAnd I should emphasize may.\nYou certainly don't need\na acetyl-L-carnitine\nin order to lose fat,\nbut now that you understand\nthe cellular process\nby which fat is mobilized and oxidized,\nit should make sense that if L-carnitine\nis important for converting\nfatty acids into energy,\nthen supplementing L-carnitine make sense.\nAcetyl-L-carnitine is\nthe type of L-carnitine\nor the form of L-carnitine I should say,\nthat is transported and utilized\nmost easily by the body.\nAnd so that's why sometimes we distinguish\nbetween L-carnitine\nand acetyl-L-carnitine.\nSo once again, we've covered\nan enormous amount of material.\nWe've talked about the science of fat loss\nand in particular, we've\nexplored this topic\nfrom the perspective\nof the nervous system.\nHow neurons and in particular\nthe release of things\nlike adrenaline, epinephrin\ncan facilitate fat mobilization\nand oxidation.\nWe talked about NEAT, fidgeting,\nthis non-exercise type movement\nthat can greatly increase caloric burn.\nAnd why that is.\nWe talked about shiver,\nanother form of non-exercise movement\nthat can really increase\nboth caloric expenditure\ndue to the shiver, due to the movement,\nas well as increase thermogenesis\nthe heating up of the body\nthrough things like brown fat,\nand even the conversion\nof white fat to brown fat\nwhich is a good thing if\nyou want to oxidize fat.\nWe talked about cold as\na particular stimulus\nto induce shiver and\nhow to use getting into,\nan out of cold as a\nway to stimulate shiver\nand avoid cold adaptation\nso that you continue\nto oxidize and burn fat,\nif that's your goal.\nIf you want to check out\nthe protocols for that,\nthere at www.thecoldplunge.com\nand in weeks to come\nwe're going to be adding\nmore protocols to that website\nnot just for fat loss,\nbut for things like resilience,\nreducing inflammation, et cetera.\nSo be sure to check those out again,\nthose are totally cost-free.\nTalked about exercise.\nHow rather than thinking\nabout cardiovascular\nor weight training exercise,\nthat we should perhaps\nlook through the lens\nof this adrenaline system\nand how it interacts\nwith fat stores and\nthink about low, medium\nor high intensity exercise.\nWhether or not we show\nup to that fasted or not.\nTurns out showing up to\nthat fasted can be useful,\nif you start with high intensity movements\nand then move into lower\nintensity type exercise.\nIf you're going to go long duration,\nit probably doesn't matter\nunless you're exercising longer\nthan 90 minutes, whether\nor not you eat or not.\nWe talked about caffeine as a stimulant\nand a stimulus for epinephrin\nand adrenaline release\nas a way to access more fat metabolism.\nAnd we talked about compounds\nthat come from things like\nyerba mate and guayusa tea,\nthis GLP-1 pathway that can\ntrigger increased fat oxidation\nso much so that the\npharmaceutical companies\nare now developing compounds specifically\nto increase GLP-1 for treatment\nof diabetes and obesity.\nBut you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway\nthrough the ingestion of things like mate\nor guayusa if that's of interest to you.\nAnd then we talked about L-carnitine\nand how L-carnitine itself is critical\nfor the fat oxidation\nwithin individual cells.\nThe conversion of fatty acids to energy.\nAnd why having your insulin low\nand things like L-carnitine\nand glucagon levels\nhigh or sufficient at least can facilitate\nthe burning of fat, fat oxidation.\nSo we covered a lot of material.\nThat's a lot of protocols\nI realize that didn't...\nThe little list I just gave right there\ndidn't even begin to\nget into all the details\nand corners that we discussed.\nI hope you found this\nconversation interesting\nboth for sake of understanding fat loss\nand how to lose fat more\nquickly and to lose more of it,\nif that's your goal.\nAs well as simply to\nunderstand the biology\nof fat metabolism from\na different perspective,\nfrom the perspective\nof the nervous system.\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\nand you're benefiting from the information\nthat you're
