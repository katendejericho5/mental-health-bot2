    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[instrumental music]\n- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is\nBelcampo Meat Company.\nBelcampo Meat Company\nis a regenerative farm\nin Northern California that\nraises organic grass fed\nand grass-finished certified humane meats.\nI eat meat about once a day.\nI'm neither pure carnivore,\nnor am I a vegetarian.\nObviously I eat meat.\nThe way I eat is I tend\nto fast until about noon\nand then I have my first meal\nwhich generally consists\nof a piece of beef.\nIt's either ground beef or a steak.\nI like ribeyes, I like flat\nirons, these kinds of things\nand a small salad,\nsometimes a large salad.\nAnd then throughout the\nday, I generally am low carb\nuntil the evening when\nI eat pasta and rice\nand things of that sort.\nEating that way is what\noptimizes my levels of alertness\nand optimizes my sleep.\nI've talked about this on\nprevious podcast episodes,\nNow, because I eat meat\nessentially every day,\nthe source of that meat is\nextremely important to me.\nI want it to be healthy for me\nand I want the animals that it comes from\nto be healthy and to\nhave lived a good life.\nConventionally raised animals\nare confined to feedlots\nand they eat a diet of\ninflammatory grains,\nwhich is terrible for them\nand it's terrible for us\nwhen we eat those meats.\nBelcampo's animals graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses,\nwhich results in meat\nthat is higher in\nnutrients and healthy fats.\nThey actually have very\nhigh levels of Omega threes\nwhich I've also talked\nabout on this podcast,\nare important for mental\nand physical health\nfor a variety of reasons.\nThe way Belcampo raises its animals\nis also good for the environment.\nThey practice regenerative agriculture,\nwhich means it's climate\npositive and carbon negative\nwhich translates to good for\nus and good for the planet.\nYou can order Belcampo\nsustainably raised meats\nto be delivered straight to your door\nusing my code Huberman by\ngoing to belcampo.com/huberman\nand you'll get 20% off\nyour first time order.\nThat's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting blood work done\nfor the simple reason that many,\nif not most of the factors that impact\nour immediate and longterm health\ncan only be assessed from a blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nwe can get additional information\nabout our current health status\nand our health trajectory.\nOne of major problems with\nblood tests and DNA tests\navailable for most sources is\nthat you get the numbers back\nand you can easily see\nwhether or not those numbers\nare within the standard\nrange or outside the range.\nBut it's very hard to know what\nto do with that information.\nAlso what the various factors are\nthat are being measured\nis often very cryptic.\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey clarify everything.\nThey make it very clear and simple\nas to what each of those\nfactors relates to,\nso they give you some\nunderstanding of what those are\nand they give you ideas and suggestions\nabout things that you can\ndo with your lifestyle,\nchanges to your diet, changes\nto your supplementation,\nchanges to your sleep\nschedule or exercise patterns\nthat can serve to optimize the levels\nof those various factors and your DNA.\nIn addition, they have something\ncalled the inner age test\nwhich compares your chronological age\nwhich you already know\nwith your biological age\nwhich gives you a sense of your lifespan\nor predicted lifespan.\nSo that's crucially\nimportant, and you can imagine\nwhy many people, including me\nwould want that information.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nand you'll get 25% off any\nof InsideTracker's plans.\nUse the code Huberman at checkout,\nthat's

an\nall-in-one vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink.\nI've been using Athletic Greens\nfor well over a decade now.\nI started using Athletic\nGreens and I still use\nAthletic Greens because\nI find it rather dizzying\nto know which vitamins\nand minerals to take.\nAnd with Athletic Greens,\nI cover all my bases\nof vitamins and minerals.\nIn addition, it has\nprobiotics and we now know\nfrom an enormous number of\nquality peer reviewed studies\nthat the gut microbiome\nis critically important\nfor our immune system function,\nfor the gut brain access\nand for our mental functions\nand probiotics are one way\nto support the gut brain axis\nand the gut health generally.\nWith Athletic Greens, I\nbasically just add water,\nput in a little bit of lemon juice\n'cause that's the way I like it.\nMix it up, it tastes delicious.\nI'll do that once or twice a day.\nIt's compatible with\nfasting at least for me,\nit doesn't take me out of a fasting mode\nwhich I do early in the day.\nSo most often I'll have my\nAthletic Greens early in the day.\nAnd then sometimes I'll\nalso have another one\nlate in the evening, or\nsometimes even before bed.\nI'm able to sleep after\ndrinking it without a problem.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich are these little\npacks that make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road\nor in the car or on a plane.\nIt makes all of that very simple.\nAnd in addition, they will\ngive you a year supply\nof vitamin D3 K2.\nThere are also a lot of\ndata supporting the fact\nthat vitamin D3 is critical\nfor a variety of health metrics.\nWe all know that we can get vitamin D3\nfrom the sun, but many people including me\nwere not getting enough sunlight or D3\neven if I was getting a lot of sunlight.\nI know that 'cause I had my\nblood levels measured of D3.\nSo I use vitamin D3 every day\nin addition to the other things I take,\nincluding Athletic Greens.\nIf you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou'll get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs\nand a year supply of\nthe vitamin D3 and K2,\nThat's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim the special offer.\nThis month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe're talking all about\nphysical performance.\nSo that means athletic\nperformance, recreational exercise,\nweightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,\nskills and skill learning.\nToday, we're going to talk about and focus\non skill learning.\nWe are going to focus on how\nto learn skills more quickly\nin particular motor skills.\nThis will also translate to things\nlike musical skills and\nplaying instruments,\nbut we're mainly going to\nfocus on physical movements\nof the body that extend beyond the hands\nlike just playing the piano or the fingers\nlike playing the guitar.\nBut everything we're going to talk about\nwill also serve the formation\nand the consolidation\nand the performance of\nother types of skills.\nSo if you're interested\nin how to perform better,\nwhether or not it's dance or yoga\nor even something that's\njust very repetitive\nlike running or swimming, this\npodcast episode is for you.\nWe're going to go deep into\nthe science of skill learning.\nAnd we are going to talk\nabout very specific protocols\nthat the science points\nto and has verified,\nallow you to learn more\nquickly to embed that learning\nso that you remember it and\nto be able to build up skills\nmore quickly than you would otherwise.\nWe are also going to touch on a few things\nthat I get asked about a\nlot, but fortunately recently\nI've had the time to go\ndeep into the literature,\nextract the data for you and\nthat's mental visualization.\nHow does visualizing a\nparticular skill or practice\nserve the learning and\nor the consolidation\nof that practice.\nIt turns out there are some\nabsolutely striking protocols\nthat one can use, striking\nmeaning they allow you\nto learn faster and they\nallow you to remember\nhow to do things more quickly and better\nthan if you were not doing\nthis mental rehearsal.\nBut the pattern of mental rehearsal\nand when you do that mental rehearsal\nturns out to be vitally important.\nSo I'm excited for today's episode.\nWe're going to share a lot\nof information with you\nand they're going to be a\nlot of very simple takeaways.\nSo let's get started.\nBefore we get into the\ntopic of skill learning\nand tools for accelerating skill learning,\nI want to briefly revisit\nthe topic of temperature\nwhich was covered in the last episode\nand just highlight a\nfew things and clear up\nsome misunderstandings.\nSo last episode talked\nabout these incredible data\nfrom my colleague, Craig\nHeller's lab at Stanford.\nHe's in the department of biology,\nshowing that cooling the\npalms in particular ways\nand at particular times can allow athletes\nor just recreational\nexercisers to do more pull-ups,\ndips, bench presses per\nunit time, to run further,\nto cycle further and to\nfeel better doing it.\nThere really are incredible\ndata that are anchored\nin the biology of the vascular\nsystem, the blood supply\nand how it's involved in cooling us.\nMany of you, dozens of you in fact said,\n\"Wait a second, you gave us\na protocol in this episode\n\"which says that we should\ncool our palms periodically\n\"throughout exercise in order\nto be able to do more work.\n\"But on the episode, before\nthat on growth hormone\n\"and thyroid hormone, you\nsaid that heating up the body\n\"is good for release of growth hormone.\"\nAnd I just want to clarify\nthat both things are true.\nThese are two separate protocols.\nYou should always warm\nup before you exercise.\nThat warmup will not increase\nyour body temperature\nor the muscle temperature to the point\nwhere it's going to\ndiminish your work capacity,\nthat it's going to harm your performance.\nThe cooling of the palms,\nwhich is really just a route\nto cool your core in an efficient way,\nthe most efficient way, in fact\nis about improving performance.\nHeating up the body with exercise\nand focusing on heat\nincreases or using sauna\nfor heat increases is geared\ntoward growth hormone release,\nwhich is a separate matter.\nSo you can do both of these protocols\nbut you would want to do\nthem at separate times.\nSo just to make this very concrete\nbefore I move on to today's topic.\nIf you're interested in doing more work,\nbeing able to do more sets\nand reps per unit time\nand feel better doing it or to run further\nor to cycle further, then\ncooling the palms periodically\nas I described in the previous episode\nis going to be the way to go.\nIf you're interested in\ngetting growth hormone release,\nwell then hot sauna.\nAnd I offered some other tools\nif you don't have a sauna\nin the episode on growth\nhormone and thyroid hormone\nis going to be the way to go.\nSo those are separate protocols.\nYou can include them\nin your fitness regime\nand your training regime,\nbut you do want to do them\nat separate times.\nAnd as a last point about this,\nI also mentioned that\ncaffeine can either help\nor hinder performance\ndepending on whether or not\nyou're caffeine adapted\nbecause of the ways\nthat caffeine impacts body temperature\nand all sorts of things like\nvasodilation and constriction.\nIt's very simple.\nIf you enjoy caffeine before your workouts\nand you're accustomed to\ncaffeine, meaning you drink it\nthree or five times or more a week.\n100 to 300 milligrams this\nis a typical daily dose\nof caffeine.\nSome of you are ingesting more, some less.\nIf you do that regularly,\nwell, then it's going to be\njust fine to ingest caffeine\nbefore you train.\nIt's not going to impact\nyour body temperature\nand your vasodilation or constriction\nin ways that will hinder you.\nHowever, if you're not\na regular caffeine user\nand you're thinking, \"Oh, I'm\ngoing to drink a cup of coffee\n\"and get this huge\nperformance enhancing effect.\"\nWell, that's not going to happen.\nChances are it's going\nto lead to increases\nin body temperature and changes\nin the way that blood flow\nis happening in your\nbody, and in particular\non these palmer surfaces and in your face\nthat is going to likely\ndiminish performance.\nSo if you enjoy caffeine\nand you're accustomed to it,\nso-called caffeine adapted,\nenjoy it before your training.\nIf you regularly, excuse\nme, if you do not regularly\nuse caffeine, then you probably\ndo not want to view caffeine\nas a performance enhancing tool.\nAnd while we're on the topic of tools\nand because this is a month\non athletic performance\nand exercise and physical skill learning,\nI want to offer an additional tool\nthat I've certainly found\nuseful, which is how to relieve\nthe so-called side stitch or side cramp\nwhen running or swimming.\nThis actually relates to respiration\nand to the nervous system\nand it is not a cramp.\nIf you've ever been out\nrunning and you felt like\nyou had a pain on your side,\nthat pain could be any number of things,\nbut what feels like cramping of your side\nis actually due to what's\ncalled collateralization\nof the phrenic nerve which\nis a lot harder to say\nthan a side cramp or a side stitch.\nBut here's the situation.\nYou have a set of nerves, which\nis called the phrenic nerve\nP-H-R-E-N-I-C.\nThe phrenic nerve, which\nextends down from your brainstem\nessentially, this region to your diaphragm\nto control your breathing.\nIt has a collateral,\nmeaning it has a branch\njust like the branch on a tree\nthat innovates your liver.\nAnd if you are not\nbreathing deeply enough,\nwhat can happen is you can\nget what's called sometimes\na referenced pain.\nReference pain is probably\ngoing to be familiar\nto any of you have ever read\nabout how to recognize heart attack.\nPeople have heart attacks\nwill sometimes have pain\non one side of their body, the left arm,\nsometimes people that have\npain in a part of their back\nor suddenly also get\npain in their shoulder\nor part of their face.\nThis has to do with the fact\nthat many of our nerves branch,\nmeaning they're collateralized\nto different organs and areas of the body.\nAnd the way those nerves\nare woven together,\nit's often the case that\nif we disrupt the pattern\nof firing of electrical activity\nin one of those nerve branches\nthat the other ones are affected too.\nThe side stitch, the pain\nin your side as often\nbecause of the contractions\nof the diaphragm\nbecause of the way you're\nbreathing while you're exercising,\nrunning, or swimming or biking.\nAnd as a consequence, you\nfeel pain in your side\nbut that's not a cramp.\nThe way to relieve it is very simple.\nYou do the physiological\nside that I've talked about\nin previous episodes of\nthe podcast and elsewhere\nwhich has a double\ninhale through the nose,\nvery deep and then a long exhale.\nAnd you might want to repeat\nthat two or three times.\nTypically that will\nrelieve the side stitch\nbecause of the way that it\nchanges the firing patterns\nof the phrenic nerve.\nSo the side stitch is\nannoying, it's painful,\nsometimes we think we're dehydrated\nand you might be dehydrated.\nBut oftentimes it's just\nthat we're breathing\nin a way that causes some\nreferenced pain of the liver.\nWe call it a side stitch or a side cramp,\nand you can relieve it very easily\nthrough the double inhale, long exhale.\nThat pattern done two or three times,\noften you can continue\nto engage in the exercise\nwhile you do the double inhale exhale,\nand it will just relieve itself that way.\nSo give it a try if you\nexperience the side stitch.\nSome people I know are also\ndoing the double inhale,\nlong exhale during long\ncontinuous bouts of exercise.\nI actually do this when I run.\nWe have decent data\nalthough these are still\nunpublished data that that can engage\na kind of regular cadence\nof heart rate variability.\nSo there are a number of reasons\nwhy this physiological side\ncan be useful, but it\ncertainly can be useful\nfor relieving the side stitch\nor so-called side cramp.\nLet's talk about the\nacquisition of new skills.\nThese could be skills such as\na golf swing or a tennis swing\nor you're shooting free throws\nor you're learning to dance\nor you're learning an instrument.\nI'm mainly going to focus\non athletic performance.\nThere are basically two types of skills.\nOpen loop and closed loop.\nOpen loop skills are\nskills where you perform\nsome sort of motor\naction and then you wait\nand you get immediate feedback\nas to whether or not it\nwas done correctly or not.\nA good example will be\nthrowing darts at a dartboard.\nSo if you throw the dart, you get feedback\nabout whether or not you hit the bullseye,\nyou're off the dart board,\nor you're some other location\non the dart board, that's open loop.\nClosed loop would be something\nthat's more continuous.\nSo let's say you're a\nrunner and you're starting\nto do some speed work and some sprints.\nAnd you're running and\nyou can kind of feel\nwhether or not you're running correctly,\nor maybe even have a coach\nand they're correcting\nyour stride or you're trying\nto do some sort of skill,\nlike a hopscotch skill,\nwhich maybe you're doing\nthe ladder work where you're stepping\nbetween designated spaces on the ground.\nThat's closed loop because as you go,\nyou can adjust your behavior\nand you can adjust the distance\nof your steps, or you\ncan adjust your speed\nor you can adjust your\nposture and you are able\nto essentially do more\npractice per unit time\nbut you're getting feedback\non a moment to moment basis.\nSo you have open loop and closed loop.\nAnd just to make this very clear,\nopen loop would be\npracticing your tennis serve.\nSo let's say that you set a target\non the other side of the net.\nYou throw the ball up\nand you hit the ball,\nit goes over that's open-loop.\nYou'll know whether or\nnot you were in the court,\nyou were on the location you wanted to hit\nor close to it or not, that's open loop.\nClosed loop would be if\nyou're in a regular can.\nSo maybe you're learning a swim stroke,\nor maybe you're trying to\nlearn a particular rhythm\non the drum.\nSo maybe you're trying to\nlearn a particular beat.\nI'm not very musical, so I'm\nnot going to embarrass myself\nby giving an example of\nthis, although later I will,\nwhere you're trying to get\na particular rhythm down.\nAnd if you're not getting it,\nyou can adjust in real time\nand try and catch up or slow\ndown or speed up, et cetera.\nSo hopefully you'll understand\nopen loop and closed loop.\nYou should always know before\nyou try and learn a skill,\nwhether or not it's\nopen loop or closed loop\nand I'll return to why\nthat's important shortly.\nBut if you want to learn something,\nask is it open loop or closed loop.\nThere are essentially three\ncomponents of any skill\nthat involves motor movement.\nAnd those are sensory\nperception, actually perceiving\nwhat you are doing and\nwhat's happening around you.\nSo what you see, what you hear,\nsometimes you're paying\nattention to what you're doing\nspecifically like the\ntrajectory of your arm\nor how you're moving your feet.\nIf you're learning to dance,\nsometimes you're more focused\non something that's\nhappening outside of you,\nlike you're listening\nfor something in music\nor you're paying attention\nto the way your partner\nis moving, et cetera.\nSo there's sensory input.\nThen there are the actual movements.\nSo they're the movements\nof your limbs and body.\nAnd then there's something\ncalled proprioception\nand proprioception is often discussed\nas kind of a sixth sense of\nknowing where your limbs are\nin relation to your body.\nSo proprioception is vitally important.\nIf I reached down and pick\nup this pen and pick it up,\nI'm not thinking about\nwhere the pen in my hand is\nrelative to my body, but\nproprioceptively, I'm aware of it\nat kind of a six sense\ndeeper subconscious level.\nI can also make myself\naware of where my limbs are.\nAnd typically when we learn,\nwe are placing more focus\non proprioception than we do ordinarily.\nSo if I get up from this\nchair and I happen to walk\nout of the room, I don't\nthink about where my feet\nare landing relative to one another.\nBut if my leg had fallen asleep\nbecause I had been leaning on\none of the nerves of my leg\nor something like that, and my\nleg feels all tingly or numb.\nI and you, if this were to happen to you,\nwould immediately notice a shift in gait.\nIt would feel strange,\nI'd have to pay attention\nto how I'm stepping.\nAnd the reason is I'm not getting\nany proprioceptive feedback.\nNow, skill learning has a\nlot of other dimensions too,\nbut those are the main ones\nthat we're going to focus on.\nSo just to remind you,\nyou need to know open loop\nor closed loop and you need\nto know whether or not,\nexcuse me, you need to know\nthat there's sensory perception\nwhat you're paying attention to,\nmovements themselves and proprioception.\nAnd there's one other important\nthing that you need to know\nwhich is that movement\nof any kind is generated\nfrom one, two or three sources\nwithin your nervous system,\nwithin your brain and body.\nThese are central pattern generators\nwhich are sometimes called\nCSPGs, excuse me, CPGSs,\nCSPGs are something entirely\ndifferent in biology.\nCPGSs, this just goes to\nshow that I have a module.\nCSPGs are chondroid and\nsulfate proteoglycans.\nThey have nothing to do with this topic.\nCPGSs are central pattern\ngenerators or CPGs,\nthey're sometimes called.\nThese CPGs are in your\nspinal cord, mine and yours,\ndifferent ones and they\ngenerate repetitive movements.\nSo if you're walking, if you're\nrunning, if you're cycling,\nif you're breathing,\nwhich presumably you are\nand you're doing that in a\nregular rhythmic cadence,\ncentral pattern generators\nare controlling that movement.\nAfter you learn how to\nwalk, run, swim, cycle,\ndo anything really, much\nof the work is handed off\nto the central pattern generators.\nAnd there were experiments that were done\nin the 60s, 70s and 80s\nthat actually looked\nat decerebrate animals and\neven decerebrate humans.\nThese are humans and animals\nthat lack a cerebral cortex.\nThey lack much of the brain\nand yet they can engage\nin what's called a fictive movement.\nSo it sounds like a kind\nof barbaric experiment.\nI'm glad I wasn't the\none to have to do them\nbut this is the stuff of\nneuroscience textbooks\nthat cats or dogs or mice that\nhave their neocortex removed\nput them on a treadmill,\nthey'll walk just fine.\nAnd they will adjust their\nspeed of walking just fine\neven though they basically\nlack all their thinking\nand decision-making brain.\nAnd it turns out humans that have,\nunfortunately, massive\nstrokes to their cortex\nand lack any neocortex but preserve\nthe central pattern generators\nwill also walk just fine,\neven though they lack any of\nthe other stuff in the brain.\nSo these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing,\nand they control a lot of\nour already learned behavior.\nWhen you're really good at something,\nCPGs are controlling a\nlot of that behavior.\nAnd that's true also for a golf swing.\nEven if it's not really repetitive,\nsomebody who's really good\nat golf it's going to,\nI guess you call it a T.\nYou put the ball on the T.\nI show with my knowledge of golf.\nI've only done mini golf, frankly,\nbut someday maybe I'll learn how to golf,\nbut you set the golf ball down and swing,\nset the golf ball down, swing.\nCentral pattern generators\nare going to handle\na lot of that.\nIf I were to go to the golf course.\nStanford has a beautiful golf course.\nIf I were to go out there\nand put a ball on the T,\nmy central pattern generators\nwould not be involved\nin that at all.\nThe moment I bring the club back to swing,\nit's going to engage other things.\nAnd the other things\nthat's going to engage\nbecause I don't know\nthat behavior now or then\nis upper motor neurons.\nWe have motor neurons in our cortex,\nin our neocortex that\ncontrol deliberate action.\nAnd those are the ones\nthat you're engaging\nwhen you are learning.\nThose are the ones that\nyou have to pay attention\nin order to engage.\nAnd that's what's happening, for instance,\nif I decide I'm going to\nreach down and pick up my pen,\nwhich I rarely think about,\nbut now I'm thinking about it\nand I'm going to do this\nin a very deliberate way.\nI'm going to grab with\nthese two fingers and lift.\nMy upper motor neurons are now involved.\nSo upper motor neurons are very important\nbecause a little bit later in the episode\nwhen we talk about how\nto use visualization\nin order to accelerate skill learning,\nit's going to leverage\nthese upper motor neurons\nin very particular ways.\nSo we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,\nupper motor neurons for\ndeliberate unlearned movements\nor movements that we are\nin the process of learning.\nAnd then we have what are\ncalled lower motor neurons.\nLower motor neurons are\nthe ones in our spinal cord\nthat send little wires out to our muscles\nwhich actually caused the\nfiring of those muscle fibers.\nSo the way to think\nabout this as you've got\nupper motor neurons which talk to CPGs\nand the lower motor neurons.\nSo it's really simple.\nAnd now, you know most\neverything there is to know\nabout the neural pathways\ncontrolling movement,\nat least for sake of this discussion.\nSo anytime we learn\nsomething, we have to decide\nwhat to place our sensory perception on,\nmeaning what are we going to focus on.\nThat's critical if\nyou're listening to this\nand you're the type of person\nwho likes taking notes,\nthis should be the\nsecond question you ask.\nRemember the first question\nis, is it open loop\nor closed loop?\nThe second question should be,\nwhat should I focus my attention\non, auditory attention,\nvisual attention or proprioception.\nShould I focus on where my\nlimbs are relative to my body\nor should I focus on the outcome?\nThis is a critical distinction.\nYou can decide to learn\nhow to do a golf swing\nor learn how to shoot free throws\nor learn how to dance tango\nand decide that you are going to focus\non the movements of your partner\nor the positions of your feet.\nYou maybe are going to look at them,\nmaybe you're going to sense them.\nYou're going to actually\nfeel where they are,\nor maybe you're going\nto sense the position\nand posture of your body,\nwhich is more proprioception.\nSo you have to allocate your attention.\nAnd I'm going to tell you how\nto allocate your attention\nbest in order to learn faster.\nSo these are the sorts of\ndecisions that you have to make.\nFortunately for you,\nyou don't have to think\nabout whether or not you're going to use\nyour upper motor neurons\nand your lower motor neurons\nor not, because if you don't\nknow how to do something,\nyou're automatically going to engage\nyour upper motor neurons.\nAnd if you do, then\nyou're not going to use\nyour upper motor neurons.\nYou're mainly going to rely\non central pattern generators.\nYou are always using\nyour lower motor neurons\nto move muscle.\nSo we can really simplify things now.\nI've given you a lot of\ninformation but we can simplify it.\nBasically open loop or closed\nloop, that's one question\nand what am I going to focus on?\nAnd then your neurology\nwill take care of the rest.\nSo now I want to talk about\nrealistic expectations.\nSomewhere in Hollywood presumably,\nit got embedded in somebody's mind\nthat instant skill\nacquisition was possible,\nthat you could take a particular pill\nor you could touch a particular object\nor you could have a wand wave over you\nand you would suddenly have a skill.\nAnd so that is the result\nof Hollywood at all.\nIt doesn't exist, at least not in reality.\nAnd I love movies, but\nit simply doesn't exist.\nThen the self-help literature\ncreated another rule\ncalled the 10,000 hours rule.\nAnd frankly, that doesn't\nreally match the literature,\nat least the scientific literature either.\nI like it because it implies\nthat learning takes time,\nwhich is more accurate\nthan the Hollywood at all\ninstant skill acquisition rule,\nwhich isn't really a rule, it's a myth.\nBut the 10,000 hours rule\noverlook something crucial,\nwhich is that it's not about hours,\nit's about repetitions.\nNow, of course there's a\nrelationship between time\nand repetitions, but there\nare some beautiful experiments\nthat point to the fact\nthat by simple adjustment\nof what you are focused\non as you attempt to learn\na new skill, you can adjust\nthe number of repetitions\nthat you do, you adjust\nyour motivation for learning\nand you can vastly accelerate learning.\nSome of you may recognize\nthis by its internet name,\nwhich is not a scientific term,\nwhich is the super Mario effect.\nThere's actually a quite\ngood video on YouTube\ndescribing the super Mario effect.\nI think it was a YouTuber\nwho has I think a background\nin science and he did an\ninteresting experiment.\nAnd I'll talk about his experiment first\nand then I will talk\nabout the neurobiology\nthat supports the result that he got.\nThe super Mario effect relates to the game\nsuper Mario brothers, but\nyou'll see why at the end.\nBut basically what they did\nwas they had 50,000 subjects,\nwhich is a enormous number\nof subjects learn a program,\nessentially taking words\nfrom a computer program\nor the commands for a computer program\nthat were kind of clustered\nin a column on the right.\nSo these are the sorts of\nthings that computer programmers\nwill be familiar with\nbut other people won't.\nAnd those commands are essentially,\nthey essentially translate\nto things like go forward.\nAnd then if it's a right\nhand turn in the maze,\nthen go right and continue\nuntil you hit a choice point,\net cetera.\nSo it's a bunch of instructions,\nbut the job of the subjects\nin these experiments were to\norganize those instructions\nin a particular way that\nwould allow a little cursor\nto move through the main successfully.\nSo basically the goal was,\nor at least what the subjects\nwere told is that anyone can\nlearn to computer program.\nAnd if somebody can just\norganize the instructions\nin the right way, then they can program\nthis little cursor to move\nthrough amaze, very simple.\nAnd yet, if you don't have any background\nin computer programming,\nor even if you do,\nit takes some skill.\nYou have to know what commands to give\nin what particular order.\nAnd they made that very easy.\nYou could just assemble them in a list\nover onto the right.\nSo people started doing this.\nNow there were two groups and\nsome one half of the subjects,\nif they got it wrong, meaning\nthey entered a command\nand the cursor would move\nand it was the wrong command\nfor this little cursor\nto move through the maze,\nthey saw a signal jump up\non their screen that said,\nthat did not work, please try again.\nThat's it, if they put\nin the wrong command\nor is in the wrong sequence,\nit'll say that did not work\nplease try again.\nAnd then the subjects would\nreorganize the instructions\nand then the little cursor would continue.\nAnd if they got it wrong again,\nit would say that does not\nwork, please try again.\nThe other half of the subjects,\nif they got something wrong\nwere told you just lost five\npoints, please continue.\nSo, that's the only\ndifference in the feedback\nthat they got.\nNow I have to confess,\nI would have predicted\nbased on my knowledge\nof dopamine circuitry\nand reward contingency\nand epinephrin and stress\nand motivated learning.\nAnd this other thing that we've been told\nin many many books on behavioral economics\nand in the self-help literature,\nwhich is that people will work much harder\nto prevent losing something than they will\nto gain something, that\nyou hear all the time.\nAnd it turns out that that's\nnot at all what happened.\nIf they looked at the\nsuccess rate of the subjects,\nwhat they found was that\nthe subjects that were told\nthat did not work, please try\nagain, had a 68% success rate.\n68% of them went on to\nsuccessfully program this cursor\nmoving through the maze.\nWhereas the ones that were\ntold you lost five points\nhad a 52% success rate, which\nis a significant difference.\nBut the source of the success\nor the lack of success\nis really interesting.\nThe subjects that were\ntold that did not work,\nplease try again, tried many,\nmany more times per unit time.\nIn other words, they made\nmore attempts at programming\nthis thing to allow this cursor\nto move through the maze.\nWhereas the people that were\ntold you lost five points\ngave up earlier or gave up entirely.\nOkay, so let's just step back from this\nbecause to me, this was very surprising.\nIt violates a lot of things that I'd heard\nin the kind of popular culture\nor the self-help literature\nthat people will work much\nharder to avoid losing something\nthan they will to gain something.\nAnd it didn't really fit\nwith what I understood\nabout reward contingencies and dopamine,\nbut it did fit well with\nanother set of experiments\nthat I'm very familiar with\nfrom the neuroscience literature.\nAnd I'll give you the punchline first.\nAnd then we're going to\ntake what these data mean\nand we're going to talk\nabout a learning protocol\nthat you can use that will\nallow you to learn skills faster\nby willingly participating\nin more repetitions\nof the skill learning,\nmeaning you will want\nto do more repetitions even\nif you're getting it wrong\nsome or most of the time.\nSo the experiment that\nI want to tell you about\nis called the tube test.\nAnd this is generally done in mice,\nalthough it's sometimes been done in rats\nand it has a lot of\nparallels to some things\nthat you've probably\nseen and experienced even\nin human life, in regular\nlife, maybe even in your life.\nSo here's the experiment.\nYou take two rats, you put\nthem in a tube or two mice,\nyou put them in a tube.\nAnd mice and rats, they don't\nlike to share the same tube.\nSo what they'll do is they'll\nstart pushing each other\nback and forth, back and forth.\nSooner or later, one of the rats or mice\npushes the other one out.\nThe one that got pushed out is the loser,\nthe one that gets the tube is the winner.\nNow you take the winner, you\ngive it a new competitor.\nAnd what you find is that the mouse or rat\nthat won previously has a much higher\nthan chance probability of\nwinning the second time.\nIn other words, winning\nbefore leads to winning again.\nAnd the reverse is also true.\nIf you take the loser\nand you put that loser in\nwith another mouse,\nfresh mouse, new mouse,\nthe loser typically will lose\nat much greater probability\nthan chance.\nAnd this is not related to\ndifferences in strength or size\nor testosterone or any other things\nthat might leap to mind\nas explanations for this\nbecause those were all controlled for.\nNow that results have been\nknown about for decades.\nBut three years ago, there\nwas a paper published\nin the Journal Science,\nphenomenal journal.\nIt's one of the three apex journals,\nthat examined the brain area\nthat's involved in this.\nTurns out a particular\narea of the frontal cortex\nfor those of you that want to know.\nAnd they did a simple experiment\nwhere the experimenters\nincreased or decreased the\nactivity of this brain area\nin the prefrontal cortex,\nlittle sub region of\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nAnd what they found is if they\nstimulated this brain area,\na mouse or rat, regardless\nof whether or not\nit had been a winner or loser before,\nbecame a winner every single time.\nAnd they showed that if\nthey blocked the activity\nof this brain area,\nregardless of whether or not\nthe mouse or rat had\nbeen a winner or loser,\nit became a loser every single time.\nAnd this translated to other scenarios,\nother competitive scenarios\nwhere they'd put a bunch of mice\nor rats in a kind of cool chamber,\nthey'd have a little\nheat lamp in the corner\nand mice like heat.\nAnd there was only enough\nspace for one mouse\nto be under the heat.\nAnd the one that had won in the tube test\nor that had the brain area stimulated\nalways got the nice warm spot.\nSo what is this magic brain\narea, what is it doing?\nWell, the reason I'm\nbringing this up today\nand the reason I'm\nbringing it up on the heels\nof the super Mario effect\nis that stimulation\nof this brain area had a very simple\nand very important effect,\nwhich was, it led to more\nforward steps, more repetitions,\nmore effort, but not in terms\nof sheer might and will,\nnot digging deeper, just more\nrepetitions per unit time.\nAnd the losers had fewer\nrepetitions per unit time.\nSo the super Mario effect,\nthis online experiment\nand the tube test, which has been done\nby various labs and\nrepeated again and again\npoint to a simple but very important rule,\nwhich is neither the 10,000 hours rule\nnor the magic wand Hollywood\nversion of learning.\nBut rather the\nneuro-biological explanation\nfor learning a skill\nis you want to perform\nas many repetitions per unit\ntime, as you possibly can.\nAt least when you're first\ntrying to learn a skill.\nI want to repeat that, you want\nto perform as many repetitions\nas you possibly can at least\nwhen you're first trying\nto learn a skill.\nNow that might sound like\na duh, it just more reps,\nbut it's not so obvious.\nThere's no reason why more repetitions\nshould necessarily lead to faster learning\nbecause you could also say,\nwell, more repetitions,\nyou can make more errors\nand those errors would\nlead to poor performance\nlike misstepping a number of times.\nAnd in these cases, there's\nvery little feedback.\nIt's not like every time\nthe rat pushes forward\nor moves back that it is sensing,\noh I'm winning, I'm losing,\nI'm winning, I'm losing\non a micro level.\nIt probably does that as it\nstarts to push the other one out\nthe rat or mouse probably\nthinks, \"I'm winning.\"\nAnd as it's backing up, it\nprobably thinks, \"I'm losing.\"\nAs you play the game,\nthe super Mario game,\nyou are told, nope, that didn't work.\nNope, that didn't work, please try again.\nBut the important thing\nis that the winners\nare always generating more\nrepetitions per unit time.\nIt's just a repeat of\nperformance, repeat of performance\neven if there are errors.\nAnd that points to\nsomething vitally important,\nwhich is reps are important\nbut making error reps\nis also important.\nIn fact, it might be the\nmost important factor.\nSo let's talk about errors and\nwhy those solve the problem\nof what to focus on.\nBecause as I said earlier, if\nyou want to learn something,\nyou need to know if it's\nopen loop or closed loop\nand you need to know what to focus on,\nwhere to place your perception.\nAnd that seems like a tough task\nbut errors will tell you\nexactly what to focus on.\nSo let's talk about errors and\nwhy you can leverage errors\nto accelerate skill learning.\nOkay, so we've established that performing\nthe maximum number of\nrepetitions per training session\nis going to be advantageous.\nAnd that might seem obvious\nbut there's a shadowy side\nto that, which is, well why\nwould I want to just repeat\nthe same thing over and over\nagain if I'm getting it wrong,\n90% of the time.\nAnd the reason is that\nthe errors actually cue\nyour nervous system to two things;\none to error correction and\nthe other is it opens the door\nor the window for neuroplasticity.\nNeuroplasticity is the brain\nand nervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience,\nessentially to custom modify itself\nin order to perform anything better.\nWe did an entire month on neuroplasticity\nand I talked a little bit about errors\nand why they're important.\nNow we're going to make this very concrete\nand operationalize it,\nmake it very actionable.\nThere was a paper that\nwas published in 2021\nfrom Norman at all.\nThis is a very important paper.\nIt was published in the Journal Neuron\nwhich is a cell press\njournal, excellent journal.\nThe title of the paper\ngives it away essentially,\nwhich is post error\nrecruitment of frontal sensory\ncortical projections promotes attention.\nNow, what that says is that\nwhen you make an error,\nit causes an activation of the brain areas\nthat anchor your attention.\nRemember we need perception, attention,\nwhich they're essentially the same thing.\nWe need proprioception\nand we need the upper\nand lower motor neurons to\ncommunicate in the proper ways.\nAnd this vital question is\nwhat to pay attention to.\nErrors tell your nervous system\nthat something needs to change.\nSo if you are performing a task or a skill\nlike you're learning how to\ndance and you're stepping\non the other person's\ntoes or you're fumbling\nor you're not getting it right,\nthose errors are opening the\npossibility for plasticity.\nIf you walk away at that point,\nyou've made the exact wrong choice.\nUnless the errors are somehow\nhazardous to your health\nor somebody else's wellbeing,\nyou want to continue\nto engage at a high repetition rate.\nThat's really where the\nlearning is possible.\nWithout errors, the brain\nis not in a position\nto change itself.\nErrors actually cue the\nfrontal cortex networks,\nwhat we call top-down processing\nand the neuromodulators,\nthings like dopamine and\nacetylcholine and epinephrin\nthat will allow for plasticity.\nSo while the super Mario experiment,\nthe maze experiment was only\nfocused on generating errors,\ntelling people that wasn't\nright, please try again\nor that wasn't right,\nyou lost five points.\nThe key distinction is\nthat the errors themselves\ncued people to the fact that they needed\nto change something.\nSo if you're trying to learn a new skill\nand you're screwing up and\nyou're making mistakes,\nthe more mistakes you\nmake, the more plastic\nyour brain becomes such\nthat when you get it right,\nthat correct pattern will be\nrewarded and consolidated.\nAnd you can trust that it will\nbecause the performance\nof something correctly\nis associated with the release\nof this neuromodulator dopamine.\nDopamine is involved in\ncraving and motivation.\nIt's involved in a lot of things,\nbut it's also involved in learning.\nWe will do an entire episode\non dopamine and learning\nbut because some of you\nare probably wondering,\nthis does not mean that just\nincreasing your dopamine levels\nbefore learning will\nallow you to learn faster.\nIn fact, increasing your\ndopamine levels before learning\nusing pharmacology will actually reduce\nwhat's called the signal to noise.\nIt will make these increases in dopamine\nthat pop up in your brain that\nsuddenly make you realize,\n\"Oh, I got that one right.\"\nIt will make those smaller relative\nto the background levels of dopamine.\nYou want a big spike in\ndopamine when you perform\na motor pattern correctly and\nyou want to make lots of errors,\nmany, many repetitions of errors\nin order to get to that\ncorrect performance.\nNow, if you're like most\npeople you're going to do this\nin a way that's somewhat random.\nMeaning let's say it's a tennis serve.\nI can't play tennis,\nI think I've probably played tennis twice.\nSo if I throw the ball\nup in the air and hit it,\nI'm going to get it wrong\nand probably hit the net,\nthen it hit the net.\nThen I'll probably go too long\nthen I'll probably go over the fence.\nAt some point, I like to\nthink I'll get it correct.\nThe dopamine signal for that\nis going to be quite big\nand I'll think, \"Okay,\nwhat did I do there?\n\"I actually don't know, I\nwasn't paying attention.\n\"What I was paying attention\nto is whether or not\n\"the ball went to the correct location\n\"on the opposite side of the net.\"\nRemember it's an open loop move,\nso I don't actually know\nwhat I did correctly.\nBut your nervous system\nwill take care of that\nprovided I in this case\ncomplete more and more\nand more repetitions.\nNow, if I were to just elevate\nmy basil level of dopamine\nby taking, I don't know,\n1500 milligrams L tyrasine\nor something, that would\nbe bad because the increase\nin dopamine would actually be much lower.\nWe would say the delta is smaller.\nThe signal to noise is smaller\nif my overall levels of\ndopamine are very, very high.\nSo I'm actually going to learn less well.\nSo for skill learning,\nmotor skill learning,\nincreasing your dopamine levels\nprior is not a good idea.\nIt might help with motivation\nto get to the learning\nbut it's not going to improve\nthe plasticity process itself\nand it's likely to hinder it.\nAnd so that's very important.\nSo these errors cue the brain\nthat something was wrong\nand they open up the\npossibility for plasticity.\nIt's what sometimes\ncalled the framing effect,\nit frames what's important.\nAnd so I think this is a\nshift that we've heard about,\ngrowth mindset which is the\nincredible discovery and theory\nand practice of my colleague,\nCarol Dweck at Stanford.\nThis is distinct from that.\nThis isn't about motivation to learn,\nthis is about how you actually learn.\nSo the key is designate a\nparticular block of time\nthat you are going to perform repetitions.\nSo maybe that's 30 minutes,\nmaybe that's an hour.\nWork for time and then try and perform\nthe maximum number of repetitions\nthat you can do safely\nfor you and others per unit time.\nThat's going to be the best\nway to approach learning\nfor most sessions.\nI will talk about other\nthings that one can do,\nbut making errors is key.\nAnd this isn't a motivational speech.\nI'm not saying, \"Oh, go make errors,\n\"errors are good for you.\n\"You have to fail in order to win.\"\nNo, you have to fail in order\nto open up the possibility\nof plasticity, but you\nhave to fail many times\nwithin the same session.\nAnd those failures will cue your attention\nto the appropriate sensory events.\nNow, sometimes we're working with a coach.\nAnd so this is a shout\nout to all the coaches,\nthank you for doing what you do.\nHowever, there needs to be at least\nwhat the scientific literature say.\nThere needs to be a period\nof each training session\nwhereby the athlete or\nthe person of any kind\ncan simply pay attention to their errors\nwithout their attention\nbeing cued to something else.\nA really well-trained coach will say,\n\"Oh, your elbows swinging too high,\n\"or you're not gripping the racket\n\"in the appropriate way,\" et cetera.\nThey can see things that\nthe practitioner can't see.\nAnd of course that's\nthe vitally important.\nBut the practitioner also needs to use\nthis error recognition signal,\nthey need to basically focus on something\nand the errors are going to\ntell them what to focus on.\nSo put simply there needs\nto be a period of time\nin which it's just\nrepetition after repetition,\nafter repetition.\nI think many people including coaches\nare afraid that bad\nhabits will get ingrained.\nAnd while indeed that's possible,\nit's very important\nthat these errors occur\nin order to cue the attentional systems\nand to open the door for plasticity.\nSo if I'm told, \"Look, I'm\nstanding a little wide,\n\"I need to tighten up\nmy stance a little bit.\"\nGreat, but then I need to\ngenerate many repetitions\nfrom that tighten stance.\nSo if I'm constantly being\ncued from the outside\nabout what I'm incorrectly,\nthat's not going to be as efficient.\nSo for some people,\nthese learning sessions\nmight be 10 minutes, for some\npeople, it might be an hour.\nWhatever you can allocate\nbecause your lifestyles\nwill vary in your whether or not\nyou're a professional\nathlete, et cetera will vary.\nYou want to get the maximum\nnumber of repetitions in\nand you want to make errors.\nThat's allowing for plasticity.\nSo science points to the fact\nthat there's a particular\nsequencing of learning sessions\nthat will allow you to learn faster\nand to retain the skill learning\nand involves doing exactly\nas I just described,\nwhich is getting as many\nrepetitions as you can\nin the learning session,\npaying attention to the errors\nthat you make.\nAnd then the rewards\nthat will be generated,\nagain, these are neurochemical rewards\nfrom the successful\nperformance of a movement\nor the approximate successful performance.\nSo maybe you get the golf\nswing better but not perfect,\nbut that's still going to be rewarded\nwith this neurochemical mechanism.\nAnd then after the session,\nyou need to do something very specific\nwhich is nothing.\nThat's right.\nThere are beautiful\ndata describing neurons\nin our hippocampus, this\narea of our brain involved\nin the consolidation of new memories.\nThose data points to\nthe fact that in sleep,\nthere's a replay of\nthe sequence of neurons\nthat were involved in certain\nbehaviors the previous day\nand sometimes the\nprevious day before that.\nHowever, there are also data that show\nthat after a skill learning session,\nany kind of motor movement\nprovided you're not bringing in\na lot more additional new sensory stimuli,\nthere's a replay of the motor sequence\nthat you performed correctly\nand there's an elimination\nof the motor sequences that\nyou performed incorrectly\nand they are run backward in time.\nSo to be very clear about\nthis, if I were to learn\na new skill or navigate a new city\nor let's just stay with the motor skill,\nlet's say the free-throw or a\ngolf swing or a tennis serve,\ndance move, novice.\nSo I'm still going to\nmake a lot of errors,\ndon't get it perfectly,\nbut maybe I get a little bit better\nor I perform it correctly\nthree times out of 1000.\nAnd it sounds like something I might do\nand there I'm probably\nbeing generous to myself.\nAfter I finished the training session,\nif I do nothing, I'm not focused\non some additional learning.\nI'm not bringing a lot of\nsensory information in.\nIf I just sit there and close my eyes\nfor five to 10 minutes, even one minute,\nthe brain starts to\nreplay the motor sequence\ncorresponding to the\ncorrect pattern movement,\nbut it plays that sequence backward.\nNow why it plays it\nbackward, we don't know.\nIf I were to wait until\nsleep or regardless\nof when I sleep later that night,\nthe sequence will be replayed forwards\nin the proper sequence.\nImmediately afterward\nit's played a backward\nfor reasons that are still unclear.\nBut the replay of that sequence backwards\nappears to be important\nfor the consolidation\nof the skill learning.\nNow, this is important because many people\nare finishing their jujitsu class\nor they're finishing their yoga class\nor they're finishing their dance class\nor they're finishing some skill learning\nand then they're immediately\ndevoting their attention\nto something else.\nYou hear a lot about visualization\nand we are going to talk\nabout visualization.\nBut in the kind of obsession with the idea\nthat we can learn things,\njust sitting there\nwith our eyes closed without\nhaving to perform a movement,\nwe've overlooked something\nperhaps even more important\nor at least equally important,\nwhich is after skill\nlearning, after putting effort\ninto something, sitting\nquietly with the eyes closed\nfor one to five to 10\nminutes allows the brain\nto replay the sequence in a\nway that appears important\nfor the more rapid consolidation\nof the motor sequence\nof the pattern and to\naccelerated learning.\nIf you'd like to learn more about this,\nthis is not work that I was involved in,\nI want to be very clear.\nThere's an excellent paper\nthat covers this and much more\nfor those of you that really\nwant to dive deep on this\nand we will dive deeper in a moment.\nThis is a review that was\npublished in the Journal Neuron,\nexcellent journal.\nMany of the papers that I'm referring to\nwere covered in this\nreview which is titled,\nNeuroplasticity Subserving\nMotor Skill Learning by Dayan\nD-A-Y-A-N, I hope I'm not\nbutchering the pronunciation\nand Cohen, by Leonard Cohen,\nbut not the Leonard Cohen\nmost of us are familiar with,\nthe musician, Leonard Cohen.\nDayan and Cohen, neuroplasticity\nsubserving motor skill learning.\nAnd this was published in\n2011, but there've been\na number of updates and the\nliterature that I've described\nin other portions of today's episode\ncome from the more recent literature\nsuch as the more recent 2021 paper.\nSo you have this basic learning session\nand then a period of time afterwards\nin which the brain can\nrehearse what it just did.\nWe hear so much about mental rehearsal\nand we always think about mental rehearsal\nas the thing you do before you\ntrain or instead of training.\nBut this is rehearsal\nthat's done afterward\nwhere the brain is just automatically\nscripting through the sequence.\nAnd for some reason,\nthat's still not clear\nas to why this would be\nthe case it runs backward.\nThen in sleep, it runs forwards\nand certainly absolutely,\nsleep and quality sleep of\nthe appropriate duration,\net cetera is going to be important\nfor learning of all kinds,\nincluding skill learning.\nWe did an entire four episodes on sleep\nand how to get better at sleeping.\nThose are the episodes\nback in January episodes,\nessentially one, two, three, and four\nand maybe even episode\nfive, I don't recall.\nBut you can go there to find out\nall about how to get better at sleeping.\nNow there are other\ntraining sessions involved.\nI'm not going to learn\nthe perfect golf swing\nor the tennis serve or how\nto dance in one session\nand I doubt you will either.\nSo the question is when to come back\nand what to do when you come\nback to the training set.\nNow, first of all, this\nprinciple of errors\nqueuing attention and\nopening the opportunity\nfor plasticity, that's\nnever going to change.\nThat's going to be true for\nsomebody who is hyper skilled\nwho's even has mastery or even\nvirtuosity in a given skill.\nRemember, when you're\nunskilled at something,\nuncertainty is very high.\nAs you become more\nskilled, certainty goes up.\nThen eventually you\nachieve levels of mastery\nwhere certainty is very\nvery high about your ability\nto perform, yours certainty\nen that of other people.\nAnd then there's this fourth\ncategory of virtuosity\nwhere somebody, maybe\nyou invites uncertainty\nback into the practice because\nonly with that uncertainty,\ncan you express your\nfull range of abilities\nwhich you aren't even aware of\nuntil uncertainty comes into the picture.\nI happened to have the great privilege\nof being friends with Laird\nHamilton, the big wave surfer\nwho's phenomenal.\nI don't surf, I certainly\ndon't surf with Laird,\nbut he, and another guy that\nhe starts with Luca Patua,\nthese guys, they're virtuosos at surfing.\nThey don't just want the\nwave that they can master,\nthey want uncertainty.\nThey're at the point in their practice\nwhere when uncertainty\nshows up like a wave\nthat's either so big or is\nmoving in a particular way\nthat it brings an element\nof uncertainty for them\nabout what they're going to\ndo that they recognize that\nas the opportunity to perform better\nthan they would otherwise.\nSo they're actually trying\nto eliminate uncertainty.\nAt the beginning of learning any skill\nand as we approach from\nuncertain to skilled to mastery,\nwe want to reduce uncertainty.\nAnd that's really what the\nnervous system is doing,\nit's trying to eliminate\nerrors and hone in\non the correct trajectories.\nIf you perform a lot of repetitions\nand then you use a\nperiod immediately after,\nwe don't really have a name for this,\nmaybe someone will come up with it\nand put it in the comment section\nif you're on YouTube, if you're\nwatching this on YouTube,\na name for this post\nlearning kind of idle time\nfor the brain.\nThe brain is an idol at\nall, it's actually scripting\nall these things in reverse\nthat allow for deeper learning\nand more quick learning.\nBut if we fill that with other things,\nif we are focused on our\nphones or we're focused\non learning something else,\nwe're focusing on our performance,\nthat's not going to serve us well,\nit's at least it's not going to\nserve the skill learning well.\nSo please, if you're interested\nin more rapid skill learning\ntry introducing these sessions,\nthey can be quite powerful.\nAnd then on subsequent sessions,\npresumably after a night's sleep\nor maybe you're doing two sessions a day,\nalthough two sessions a\nday is going to be a lot\nfor most people, unless\nyou're a professional\nor a high-level athlete,\nthe subsequent sessions\nare where you get to express the gains\nof the previous session,\nwhere you get to perform well,\npresumably more often\neven if it's just subtle.\nSometimes there'll be a\ndecrease in performance,\nbut most often you're\ngoing to perform better\non subsequent and subsequent\ntraining sessions.\nAnd there is the opportunity\nto devote attention\nin very specific ways, not\njust let the errors inform you\nwhere to place your attention,\nbut rather to direct\nyour perception to particular\nelements of the movement\nin order to accelerate learning further.\nSo to be very clear,\n'cause I know many of you\nare interested in concrete protocols.\nIt's not just that you\nwould only let errors\ncue your attention on the first session.\nYou might do that for one\nsession or five sessions,\nis going to depend.\nBut once you're familiar with something\nand you're performing it\nwell every once in a while,\nyou're accomplishing it\nbetter every once in a while,\nthen you can start to cue your attention\nin very deliberate ways.\nAnd the question therefore becomes\nwhat to cue your attention to.\nAnd the good news is it doesn't matter.\nThere is a beautiful set of\nexperiments that have been done\nlooking at sequences of keys\nbeing played on a piano.\nThis is work that was published\njust a couple of years ago.\nThere are actually several papers now\nthat are focused on this.\nOne of them was published in 2018.\nThis is from Claudia Lappe\nand colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.\nShe's done some really nice\nwork, which talks about\nthe influence of pitch feedback\non learning of motor\ntiming and sequencing.\nAnd this was done with piano\nbut it carries over to\nathletic performance as well.\nSo I'm going to describe the study to you,\nbut before I describe it,\nwhat is so interesting\nabout this study that I\nwant you to know about\nis that it turns out it\ndoesn't matter so much\nwhat you pay attention to\nduring the learning sequence\nprovided it's something\nrelated to the motor behavior\nthat you're performing.\nThat seems incredible.\nI'm not good at a tennis serve.\nSo if I've done let's say\na thousand repetitions\nof the tennis serve.\nMaybe I got it right three to 10 times.\nNow I'm being even more\ngenerous with myself.\nAnd I do this post-training session\nwhere I let my brain idle\nand I get some good sleep\nand I come back and now I\nstart generating errors again,\npresumably or hopefully fewer errors,\nbut I decide I'm going to cue my attention\nto something very specific,\nlike maybe how tightly\nI'm holding the racket\nor maybe it's my stance,\nor maybe it's whether or not\nI rotate my right shoulder in\nas I hit the ball across.\nAnd I'm making this up,\nagain I don't play tennis.\nTurns out that it as long\nas it's the same thing\nthroughout the session,\nlearning is accelerated.\nAnd I'll explain why this\nmake sense in a moment.\nBut just to be really clear,\nyou can and one should\nuse your powers of attention\nto direct your attention\nto particular aspects of a motor movement\nonce you're familiar with the\ngeneral theme of the movement.\nBut what you pay attention\nto exactly is not important.\nWhat's important is that you pay attention\nto one specific thing.\nSo what Claudia Lappe\nand colleagues showed\nwas that if people are trying\nto learn a sequence of keys\non the piano, there are\nmultiple forms of feedback.\nThere are error signals if for instance,\nthey hear a piece of music\nand then they're told\nto press the keys in a particular sequence\nand the noise that comes\nout, the sound that comes out\nof the piano does not sound\nlike the song they just heard.\nSo instead of, and here, forgive me\nbecause I'm neither\nmusical, nor can I sing.\nBut instead of dah, dah\ndah, dah, they hear that,\ndah, dah dah, dah\nand then instead when they play.\nIf it were me, it sounds something like,\ndah, dah dah [indistinct],\nit wouldn't sound right.\nIt wouldn't sound right, because\nI likely got the sequence\nwrong, or I was pressing\ntoo hard on the keys\nor too lightly on the keys, et cetera.\nWhat they showed was if\nthey just instruct people\nabout the correct sequence\nto press on the keys,\nit actually doesn't matter\nwhat sound comes back,\nprovided it's the correct\nsound or it's the same sound.\nAll right, so here's the experiment.\nThey had people press on these keys\nand it was a typical\npiano and it generated\nthe particular sequence of\nsounds that would be generated\nby pressing the keys on the piano.\nOr they modified the keyboard\nin this case or piano\nsuch that when people pressed on the keys,\na random tone different tones were played\neach time they pressed on the keys.\nSo it sounded crazy,\nit sounded like noise,\nbut the motor sequence was the same.\nOr they had a single tone\nthat was played every time\nthey pressed a key and the\njob or the task of the subject\nwas just oppressed the keys\nin the proper sequence.\nSo instead of dunt,\ndunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,\nit it was just dunt,\ndunt, dunt, dunt, dunt.\nInstead of dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,\nit's dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\nIt's even hard for me to\nsay it in even a tone,\nbut you get the idea.\nSo a singular tone, just\nthink a doorbell being rung\nwith each press of the key\nwill be really annoying.\nBut it turns out that the\nrate to motor learning\nwas the same, whether or not\nthey were getting feedback\nthat was accurate to the keys of the piano\nor whether or not it was a constant tone.\nPerformance was terrible\nand the rates of learning\nwere terrible if they were\ngetting random tones back.\nSo what this means is that\nlearning to play the piano\nat least at these early stages\nis really just about\ngenerating the motor commands.\nIt's not about paying\nattention to the sound\nthat's coming out of the piano.\nAnd this makes sense because\nwhen we are beginners,\nwe are trying to focus our\nattention on the things\nthat we can control.\nAnd if you think about this,\nif you conceptualize this,\npressing the keys on the\npiano and paying attention\nto the sounds that are\ncoming out are two things.\nSo what this means is\nthat as you get deeper\nand deeper into a practice,\nfocusing purely on the motor\nexecution can be beneficial.\nNow, this is going to be harder to do\nwith open loop type things\nwhere you're getting feedback.\nI guess a good example of open loop\nwould be the attempt at a back flip.\nIf you get it wrong, you\nwill immediately know,\nif you get it right,\nyou'll immediately know.\nPlease don't go out and\ntry and do a back flip\non the solid ground,\nor even on a trampoline\nif you don't know what you're doing\nbecause very likely you'll get it wrong\nand you'll get injured.\nBut if it's something that is closed loop\nwhere you can repeat again and\nagain, and again and again,\nthat is advantageous\nbecause you can perform\nmany many repetitions and\nyou can start to focus\nor learn to focus your attention\njust on the pattern of movement.\nIn other words, you can\nlearn to play the piano\njust as fast or maybe even faster\nby just focusing on the\nsequence that you are moving\nyour digits, your fingers\nand not the feedback.\nNow, I'm sure there are\nmusic teachers out there\nand piano teachers that are screaming,\n\"No you're going to ruin the practice\n\"that all of us have embedded in our minds\n\"and in our students.\"\nAnd I agree, at some\npoint you need to start\nincluding feedback about whether or not\nthings sound correct.\nBut one of the beauties of skill learning\nis that you can choose to parameterize it,\nmeaning you can choose to just\nfocus on the motor sequence\nor just focus on the\nsounds that are coming back\nand then integrate those.\nAnd so we hear a lot about chunking,\nabout breaking things down\ninto their component parts.\nBut one of the biggest\nchallenges for skill learning\nis knowing where to place your attention.\nSo to dial out again,\nwe're building a protocol\nacross this episode, early sessions,\nmaybe it's the first one,\nmaybe it's the first 10,\nmaybe it's the first 100.\nIt depends on how many\nrepetitions you're packing in.\nBut during those initial sessions,\nthe key is to make many errors\nto let the reward process\ngovern the plasticity, let the\nerrors open the plasticity.\nAnd then after the learning sessions,\nto let the brain go idle\nat least for a short period of time\nand of course, to maximize sleep.\nAs you start incorporating more sessions,\nyou start to gain some skill level,\nlearning to harness and\nfocus your attention\non particular features of the movement\nindependent of the\nrewards and the feedback.\nSo the reward is no longer in\nthe tone coming from the piano\nor whether or not you\nstruck the target correctly\nbut simply the motor\nmovement focusing your,\nfor instance in a dart throw,\non the action of your arm.\nThat is embedding the\nplasticity in the motor pattern\nmost deeply, that's what's been shown\nby the scientific literature.\nI'm sure there are coaches\nand teachers out there\nthat will entirely disagree\nwith me and that's great.\nPlease let me know what you prefer,\nlet me know where you think this is wrong\nand it rarely happens, but\nlet me know where you think\nthis might be right as well.\nSo we're breaking the\nlearning process down\ninto its component parts.\nAs we get more and more skilled,\nmeaning as we make fewer and fewer errors\nper a given session per unit\ntime, that's when attention\ncan start to migrate from one feature\nsuch as the motor sequence\nto another feature\nwhich is perhaps one's\nstance and another sequence,\ncomponent of the sequence,\nwhich would be the result\nthat's one getting on\na trial to trial basis.\nSo changing it up each time.\nSo maybe I served the tennis ball\nand I'm focusing on where the ball lands\nand then I'm focusing on the speed,\nthen I'm focusing on my grip,\nthen I'm focusing on my stance\nfrom trial to trial.\nBut until we've mastered\nthe core motor movements\nwhich has done session to session,\nthat at least according to the literature\nthat I have access to here,\nseems to be suboptimal.\nSo hopefully this is\nstarting to make sense,\nwhich is that these connections\nbetween upper motor neurons,\nlower motor neurons and\ncentral pattern generators,\nyou can't attack them all at once.\nYou can't try and change them all at once.\nAnd so what we're doing is\nwe're breaking things down\ninto their component parts.\nSome of you may be wondering\nabout speed of movement.\nThere are some data, meaning\nsome decent papers out there\nshowing that ultra slow movements,\nperforming a movement\nessentially in slow motion\ncan be beneficial for enhancing\nthe rate of skill learning.\nHowever, at least from my\nread of the literature,\nit appears that ultra slow\nmovements should be performed\nafter some degree of proficiency\nhas already been gained\nin that particular movement.\nNow that's not the way I\nwould have thought about it.\nI would have thought, well,\nif you're learning how to do\na proper kick or a paunch in martial arts\nor something that ultra\nslow movements at first\nare going to be the way\nthat one can best learn\nhow to perform a movement\nand then you just gradually\nincrease the speed.\nIt turns out that's not the case\nand I probably should have known that.\nAnd you should probably know\nthat because it turns out\nthat when you do ultra slow movements,\ntwo things aren't available to you.\nOne is the proprioceptive\nfeedback is not accurate\nbecause of fast movements\nof limbs are very different\nthan slow movements of limbs.\nSo you don't get the opportunity\nto build in the proprioceptive feedback.\nBut the other reason why it doesn't work\nis that it's too accurate,\nyou don't generate errors.\nAnd so the data that I was able to find\nshow that very slow\nmovements can be beneficial\nif one is already\nproficient in a practice,\nbut very slow movements at the beginning\ndon't allow you to learn more quickly\nbecause you never generate errors\nand therefore the brain doesn't,\nit's not open for change.\nThe window for plasticity has\nnever swung open, so to speak.\nSo it brings us back to this theme\nthat errors allow for plasticity,\ncorrect performance of movements\nor semi correct performance of\nmovements, cues the synapses\nin the brain areas and spinal\ncircuits that need to change.\nAnd then those changes occur in the period\nimmediately after skill\nlearning and in sleep.\nSo super slow movements can be beneficial\nonce you already have some proficiencies.\nSo this might be standing\nin your living room\nand just in ultra slow motion,\nperforming your tennis serve, learning to,\nor thinking about how\nyou're adjusting your elbow\nand your arm and the trajectory\nexactly how you were taught\nby your tennis coach.\nBut trying to learn it\nthat way from the outset\ndoes not appear to be the\nbest way to learn a skill.\nWhen should you start to\nintroduce slow learning?\nWell, obviously talk to\nyour coaches about this,\nbut if you're doing this recreationally\nor you don't have a coach,\nI realize many of you don't.\nI don't have a coach\nfor anything that I do.\nI'm going to have just navigating it\nby using the scientific literature.\nIt appears that once you're\nhitting success rates\nof about 25 or 30%, that's\nwhere the super slow movements\ncan start to be beneficial.\nBut if you're still\nperforming things at a rate\nof five or 10% correct\nand the rest are errors,\nthen the super slow movements\nare probably not going\nto benefit you that much.\nAlso super slow movements\nare not really applicable\nto a lot of things.\nFor instance, you could\nimagine throwing a dart\nsuper slow motion, but if you actually try\nand throw an actual dart,\nthe dart's just going to\nfall to the floor, obviously.\nSo there are a number of\nthings like baseball bat swing\nwhich you can practice\nin super slow motion.\nBut if you try and do that\nwith an actual baseball\nor softball or something like that,\nthat's not going to give\nyou any kind of feedback\nabout how effective it was.\nSo super slow movements\nor a decelerated movement\nhas its place but once you're\nalready performing things\nreasonably well like maybe\n25 to 30% success rate.\nAnd I've tried this, I actually,\nI struggle with basketball\nfor whatever reason and\nmy free throw is terrible.\nSo I practiced free throws\nin super slow motion\nand I nailed them every time,\nthe problem is there's no ball.\nSome of you already have a\nfair degree of proficiency,\nof skill in a given practice\nor sport or instrument.\nAnd if you're in this sort\nof advanced intermediate\nor advanced levels of\nproficiency for something,\nthere is a practice that you\ncan find interesting data for\nin the literature, which\ninvolves metronoming.\nSo this you'll realize relates\nto generating repetitions\nand it relates to the tone experiment\nwhere it doesn't really\nmatter what your attention\nis cued to as long as you are performing\nmany many reps of the motor sequence.\nYou can use a metronome and\nobviously musicians do this,\nbut athletes can do this too.\nYou can use a metronome to set the cadence\nof your repetitions.\nNow for swimmers, there's\nactually a device.\nI was able to find online,\nI forgot what the brand name was\nand that's not what this is\nabout, but that actually goes\nin the swim cap that can cue you\nto when you need to\nperform another stroke.\nAnd for runners, there are\nother metronome type devices\nthat through headphones or\nthrough a tone in the room\nif you're running\nindoors or on a treadmill\nwe'll cue you to when you basically\nyou need to lift your heels.\nAnd if you do that, what athletes find\nis they can perform more repetitions,\nthey can generate more output,\nyou can increase speed.\nA number of really interesting\nthings are being done\nwith auditory metronoming.\nAnd then I'm involved in\na little bit of work now\nthat hopefully I'll be\nable to report back to you\nabout using stroboscopic metronoming.\nSo actually changing the speed\nof the visual environment.\nThese are fun experiments,\nbasically changing\none's perception of how fast\nthey're moving through space\nby playing with the visual system,\nsomething for a future discussion.\nBut you can start to\nuse auditory metronoming\nfor generating more\nmovements per unit time\nand generating more errors\nand therefore more successes\nand more neuroplasticity.\nThere are a number of\ndifferent apps out there.\nI found several free\napps where you can set in\na metronome pace, or\nit might be tick, tick,\ntick, tick, tick, tick.\nThat's a little fast for most things,\nbut you can imagine if this were darts\nor this were golf swings\nthat it might be tick,\ntick, tick, tick or something\nmore like tick, tick.\nAnd every time the\nmetronome goes, you swing.\nEvery time the metronome\ngoes, you throw a dart.\nActually there's some wild\nexperiments out there.\nYou know there's a world\nchampionship of cup stacking.\nThere's a young lady who I\nsaw could take all these cups\nspread out on a table and\nbasically just stack them\ninto the perfect pyramid in\nthe least amount of times\nand all the kids go wild.\nThis is something I'd\nnever thought to pursue\nand frankly never will pursue\nunless my life depends\non it for some reason,\nbut it's really impressive.\nAnd if you look at the sequence\n'cause these have been recorded,\nyou can look this up on YouTube.\nWhat you'll find is that\nthese expert cup stackers,\nit's just all about error elimination.\nBut they're two metronomic\nand auditory cues\ncan actually cue them to\npick up the cups faster\nthan they would ordinarily\nand to learn to do that.\nYou can do this for anything.\nI think cup stacking\nis probably not a skill\nmost of you are interested in doing,\nbut for any skill, if you\nfigure out at what rate\nyou are performing\nrepetitions per unit time\nand you want to increase that slightly,\nyou set a metronome\nwhich is slightly faster\nthan your current rate and\nyou just start generating\nmore repetitions.\nNow what's interesting\nabout this and is cool\nis it relates back to the experiment\nfrom Lappe and colleagues,\nwhich is your attention\nis now harnessed to the\ntone, to the metronome,\nnot necessarily to what you're doing\nin terms of the motor movement.\nAnd so really you need\na bit of proficiency.\nAgain, this is for people\nwho are in intermediate\nor advanced intermediate or advanced.\nBut what you're essentially\ndoing is you're creating\nan outside pressure, a\ncontingency so that you generate,\nagain, more errors.\nSo it's all about the errors that you get.\nNow, these aren't errors\nwhere all the cups tumble\nor you have to stop or you can't keep up,\nyou have to set the pace just a little bit\nbeyond what you currently can do.\nAnd when you do that,\nyou're essentially forcing\nthe nervous system to make\nerrors and correct the errors\ninside of the session.\nI find this really interesting\nbecause what it means\nis, again you've got sensory perception,\nwhat you're paying attention to,\nproprioception where your\nlimbs are and the motor neurons\nin your upper lower motor neurons\nand central pattern generators.\nAnd you can't pay attention to,\n\"Well, they're my upper motor neurons,\n\"they're my lower motor neurons.\"\nForget that, you're not going to do that.\nYou can't pay attention to\nyour proprioception too much.\nThat would be the super slow motion\nwould be the proprioception.\nBut you have to harness\nyour attention to something.\nAnd if you harness your attention\nto this outside\ncontingency, this metronome\nthat's firing off and saying,\nnow go, now go, now go.\nNot only can you increase the\nnumber of repetitions, errors\nand successes, but for some\nreason and we don't know why,\nthe regular cadence of\nthe tone of the metronome\nand the fact that you are\nanchoring your movements\nto some external force,\nto some external pressure\nor cue seems to accelerate the plasticity\nand the changes and the\nacquisition of skills\nbeyond what it would be if\nyou just did the same number\nof repetitions without\nthat outside pressure.\nWe don't know exactly\nwhat the mechanism is.\nPresumably it's neurochemical,\nlike there's something\nabout keeping up with\na timer or with a pace\nthat presumably and I'm speculating here,\ncauses the release of\nparticular chemicals.\nBut I think it's really cool.\nMetronomes, they're totally inexpensive,\nat least the ones that\nyou use outside of water\nare very inexpensive.\nYou can find these free apps,\nyou can use a musical metronome.\nSo metronomes are a powerful tool as well\nin particular for speed work.\nSo for sprinting or swimming or running\nwhere the goal is to generate more strokes\nor more efficient strokes\nor more steps, et cetera.\nThe rate of the metronome obviously\nis going to be very important.\nSometimes you're trying\nto lengthen your stride,\nsometimes you're trying\nto take fewer strokes\nbut glide further in\nthe pool for instance.\nBut the value of occasionally\njust the number of repetitions,\nthe number of strokes\nor steps, et cetera per unit time is also\nthat you're training the\ncentral pattern generators\nto operate at that higher speed.\nOne of the sports has\nkind of interesting to me\nis speed walking.\nIt's not one I engage in or\never planned to engage in,\nbut if you've ever tried\nto really speed walk,\nit's actually difficult\nto walk very very fast\nwithout breaking into a run.\nAll animals have these\nkinds of crossover points\nwhere you go.\nI think with horses it's\nlike it was that they trot,\nthen they gallop on, or\nwhat's the next thing.\nClearly, I don't know\nanything about horses\nexcept that they're beautiful\nand I liked them very much.\nBut they break into a\ndifferent kind of stride.\nAnd that's because you shift over\nto different central pattern generators.\nSo when you're walking or a\nhorse is moving very slowly\nand then it breaks into a jog\nand then into a full sprint\nor gallop for the horse,\nyou're actually engaging different\ncentral pattern generators.\nAnd those central pattern generators\nalways have a range of\nspeeds that they're happiest\nto function at.\nSo with the metronoming\nfor speed purposes,\nwhat you do is you can\nbasically bring the activity\nof those central pattern generators\ninto their upper range and\nmaybe even extend their range.\nAnd there's a fascinating biology\nof how central pattern\ngenerators work together.\nThere's coupling of central\npattern generators, et cetera\nin order to achieve maximum\nspeeds and et cetera.\nIt's a topic for a kind\nof an advanced session.\nCosta loves this topic, he just barked.\nAnd he loves it so much, he barked again.\nIn any event, the metronome\nis a powerful tool,\nagain for more advanced practitioners\nor for advanced\nintermediate practitioners.\nBut it's interesting\nbecause it brings back\nthe point that what we\nput our attention to\nwhile we're still learning is important\nto the extent that it's on one thing\nat least for the moment or trial to trial,\nbut that what we focus our\nattention on can be external,\nit can be internal and\nultimately the skill learning\nis where all that is brought together.\nSo let's talk about where\nskill learning occurs\nin the nervous system.\nAnd then I'm going to give you a really,\nwhat I think is a really cool tool\nthat can increase flexibility\nand range of motion\nbased on this particular brain area.\nIt's a tool that I used and\nwhen I first heard about,\nI did not believe would work.\nThis is not a hack, this\nis actually anchored deeply\nin the biology of a particular\nbrain region that we all have\nwhose meaning is mini brain.\nAnd that mini brain that we all have\nis called your cerebellum.\nThe cerebellum is called the mini brain\nbecause it's in the back of your brain.\nIt looks like a little mini version\nof the rest of your brain.\nIt's an absolutely incredible structure\nthat's involved in movement.\nIt also has a lot of non-movement\nassociated functions.\nIn brief, the cerebellum\ngets input from your senses,\nparticularly, your eyes and pays attention\nto where your eyes are in\nspace, what you're looking at.\nIt basically takes information\nabout three aspects\nof your eyes and eye\nmovements which are occurring\nwhen your head goes like\nthis, which is called pitch.\nSo this is pitch.\nFor those of you that are\nlistening I'm just nodding\nup and down then there's yaw,\nwhich is like shaking your\nhead, no, from side to side.\nAnd then there's roll,\nwhich is that like sometimes\nif you see a primate, like\na Marmoset or something,\nthey will roll their head\nwhen they look at you.\nActually, the reason they\ndo that is it helps generate\ndepth perception, it's a kind\nof form of motion parallax\nif you're curious why they do that.\nIt's not to look cute, they do\nit because when they do that,\neven if you're stationary\nand they're stationary,\nthey get better depth perception\nas to how far away from them you are.\nSo you've got pitch, yaw and roll.\nAnd as you move your head\nand as you move your body\nand you move through space,\nthe image on your retina moves,\npitch, yaw on roll in some combination,\nthat information is\nrelayed to your cerebellum.\nSo it's rich with visual information.\nThere's also a map of your body surface\nand your movements and\ntiming in the cerebellum.\nSo it's an incredible\nstructure that brings together\ntiming of movements,\nwhich limbs are moving\nand has proprioceptive information.\nIt really is a mini brain,\nit's just the coolest\nlittle structure back there.\nAnd in humans, it's\nactually not that little,\nit's just an incredible structure.\nNow, all this information\nis integrated there,\nbut what most people don't tell\nus is that a lot of learning\nof motor sequences of skill\nlearning that involves timing\noccurs in the cerebellum.\nNow, you can't really use that information\nexcept to know that after you\nlearn something pretty well,\nit's handed off or kind of\nhandled by your cerebellum,\nbut there is something that\nyou can do with your cerebellum\nto increase range of\nmotion and flexibility.\nMuch of our flexibility, believe it or not\nis not because our tendons\nare particular length\nor a elasticity, although\nthat plays some role,\nit's not because our muscles are short.\nI don't know what that would even mean.\nSome people have longer muscle bellies\nor shorter muscle bellies,\nbut your muscles always\nessentially span the\nentire length of the bone\nor limb or close to it,\nalong with your tendons.\nBut has to do with the\nneural innervation of muscle\nand the fact that when\nmuscles are elongated,\nthere's a point at which\nthey won't stretch out\nany longer and the nerves\nfire, and they shut down\nthat you actually have inhibitory pathways\nthat prevent you from\ncontracting the muscles\nor from extending them, from\nstretching them out any more.\nSo you can do this right now.\nIf you're driving, don't do\nit because unless you have\na self-driving car, you'll\nneed to take your hands\noff the steering.\nBut because of the way that\nvision and your muscles\nare represented in your cerebellum,\nit turns out that your\nrange of visual motion\nand your range of vision,\nliterally how wide a field of view\nyou take impacts how far\nyou can extend your limbs.\nSo we'll talk about this in a second\nexactly how to do this and explore this.\nBut as you move through\nspace, as you walk forward\nor you walk backward,\nor you tilt your head\nor you learn a skill, or you\njust operate in the normal ways\nthroughout your day,\ndriving, biking, et cetera,\nyour eyes are generating\nspontaneous movements\nto offset visual slip.\nIn other words, you don't\nsee the world as blurry\neven though you're\nmoving because your eyes\nare generating low\ncompensatory eye movements\nto offset your motion.\nSo if I spin, we could do this experiment.\nThere's a fun experiment\nwe do with medical students\nwhere you spin them around in\na chair with their eyes closed\nand then you stop and you\nhave them open their eyes\nand their eyes are going\nlike this, is nystagmus.\nI don't suggest you do this experiment.\nWhen we were kids, we did\na different experiment\nwhich was to take a stick\nand to look at the top\nof the stick and to\nspin around on the lawn\nlooking at the top of the\nstick then put it down\non the ground and try and jump over it.\nAnd you ended up like jumping to the side,\nyou miss the thing entirely.\nThe reason those two \"experiments\"\nwhich I hope you don't do\nor for somebody else to do.\nThe reason they work is because\nnormally your eye movements\nand your balance and your limb\nmovements are coordinated.\nBut when you spin around\nlooking up at the stick,\nwhat you're doing is\nyou're fixating your eyes\non one location while you're moving.\nAnd then when you stop\nthose two mechanisms\nare completely uncoupled\nand it's like being thrown\ninto outer space.\nI've never been to outer space,\nbut probably something like\nthat, low gravity, zero gravity.\nIf you spin around in your\nchair with your eyes closed,\nyou're not giving the visual\ninput that you're spinning.\nAnd then you open the eyes\nand then the eyes only have\nwhat we call the vestibular,\nyour eyes jolting\nback and forth, back and forth.\nAgain, these aren't\nexperiments you need to do\n'cause I just told you the result.\nHowever, if you want to\nextend your range of motion,\nyou can do that by...\nThese things always look\ngoofy, but at this point\nI'm just kind of used\nto doing these things.\nIf I want to extend my range of movement,\nfirst, I want to measure\nmy range of motion.\nIf you're listening what I'm\ndoing is I'm stretching out\nmy arms like a T on either side\nand I'm trying to push\nthem as far back as I can,\nwhich for me feels like it's\nin line with my shoulders\nand I can't get much further.\nI'm not really super flexible\nnor am I particularly\ninflexible at least physically.\nSo what I would then do is stop.\nI would move my eyes to the far periphery.\nSo I'm moving my eyes\nall the way to the left\nwhile keeping my head and body stationary.\nI'm trying to look over my\nleft shoulder as far as I can\nthen off to the right.\nIt's a little awkward to\ndo this, then up then down\nbut I'm mostly going to just focus on left\nand then right.\nNow what that's doing\nis it's sending a signal\nto my cerebellum that my field\nof view is way over to there\nand way over to there.\nRemember your visual\nattention has an aperture.\nIt can be narrow, or it can be broad.\nAnd I've talked about some of the benefits\nof taking a broad visual aperture\nin order to relax the nervous system.\nThis is just moving my eyes, not my head,\nlike I just did for a\nsecond, from side to side.\nNow I can retest.\nAnd actually you get about\na five to 15 degree increase\nin your range of motion.\nNow I'm doing this for you.\nYou can say, \"Well, he\ngamed it 'cause he knew\n\"the result that he was hoping for.\"\nBut you can try this.\nAnd you can do this for legs too.\nYou can do this for any limb essentially.\nAnd that's it's purely cerebellar.\nAnd it's because the proprioceptive visual\nand limb movement feedback converge\nin the ways that we\ncontrol our muscle spindles\nand the way we control the\nmuscle fibers and the tendons\nand essentially you can\nget bigger range of motion.\nSo actually we'll warm up before exercise\nor before skill learning by\nboth doing movements for my body\nbut also moving my eyes from side to side\nin order to generate\nlarger range of motion\nif range of motion is something\nthat I'm interested in.\nSo that's a fun one that you\ncan play with a little bit\nand it's purely cerebellar.\nSome other time we'll get back\ninto a cerebellar function.\nThere's all sorts of just incredible stuff\nthat you can do with cerebellum.\nI talked in an earlier\nepisode on neuro-plasticity\nabout how you can disrupt\nyour vestibular world.\nIn other words, by getting\ninto modes of acceleration,\nmoving through space where\nyou're tilted in certain ways,\nit can open up the windows for plasticity\nand yet other ways.\nSo you can check that out, it's\none of the earlier episodes\non neuroplasticity\neverything's timestamped.\nBut meanwhile, if you want to\nexpand your range of motion\nbefore doing skill learning or\nafterward, this is a fun one.\nIt's also kind of neat because\nI have this kind of aversion\nto stretching work.\nIt never seems like something I want to do\nand so I always put it off.\nSo if I start with the\nvisual practice of expanding\nmy field of view to off to\none side or the other side\nor up or down, then what\nI find is I'm naturally\nmore flexible.\nI'm not naturally more flexible.\nWhat's happened is I've\nexpanded my range of motion.\nLet's talk about visualization\nand mental rehearsal.\nI've been asked about this a lot,\nand I think it relates\nback to that kind of matrix\nHollywood idea that we can\njust be embedded with a skill.\nAlthough in this case, in fairness,\nvisualization involves some work.\nAnd I've talked about\nthis on an earlier episode\nthat some people find it very hard\nto mentally visualize things.\nAnd some people find it very easy.\nThere was great work that\nwas done in the 1960s\nby Roger Shepherd at\nStanford and by others,\nlooking at people's ability to rotate\nthree-dimensional objects in their mind.\nAnd some people really good at this\nand some people are less good at this.\nAnd one can get better\nat it by repeating it.\nBut the question we're\ngoing to deal with today\nis does it help, does it\nlet you learn things faster?\nAnd indeed the answer\nappears to be yes, it can.\nHowever, despite what you've\nheard, it is not as good.\nIt is not a total replacement\nfor physical performance itself.\nSo I'm going to be really\nconcrete about this.\nI hear all the time that just imagining\ncontracting a muscle can\nlead to the same gains\nas actually contracting that muscle.\nJust imagining a skill can\nlead to the same increases\nin performance as actually\nexecuting that skill.\nAnd that's simply not the case.\nHowever, it can supplement\nor support physical training\nand skill learning in ways\nthat are quite powerful.\nOne of the more\ninteresting studies on this\nwas from Rang Ganason at all,\nforgive me for the pronunciation.\nThis was a slightly older paper, 2004,\nbut nonetheless was one that I thought\nhad particularly impressive results\nand included all the\nappropriate controls, et cetera.\nAnd what they did is they\nlooked at 30 subjects.\nThey divide them into different groups.\nThey had one group perform\nessentially finger flection.\nSo it actually sort of the\nimagine if you're just listening\nto this, the come here a finger movement.\nThey also had elbow flection,\nso bicep curl type movement.\nAnd they either had subjects\ndo a actual physical movement\nagainst resistance, or to\nimagine moving their finger\nor their wrist towards the shoulder,\nmeaning at the bending at the elbow\ntowards actual resistance.\nJust to make a long story short,\nwhat they found was that\nthere were increases\nin this finger, adduction\nstrength, abduction,\nexcuse me, strength of about\n35% and the elbow flection\nstrength by about 13.5%,\nwhich are pretty impressive\nconsidering that was just done mentally.\nSo they had people imagine\nmoving against a weight,\na very heavyweight or had\nimagined people moving their wrist\ntowards their shoulder\nagainst a very heavyweight.\nBut again, they weren't doing it,\nthey were just imagining it.\nOther experiments looked at the brain\nand what was happening in\nthe brain during this time.\nSo we'll talk about that in a moment.\nBut essentially what they\nfound were improvements\nin strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.\nHowever, the actual\nphysical training group,\nthe groups that actually moved their wrist\nor moved their finger against\nan actual physical weight\nhad improvements of about 53%.\nSo this repeats over and over\nthroughout the literature\nmental rehearsal can cause\nincreases in strength.\nIt can create increases in\nskill acquisition and learning,\nbut they are never as great if done alone\nas compared to the\nactual physical execution\nof those movements or\nthe physical movement\nof those weights, which\nshouldn't come as so surprising.\nHowever, if we step back and we say,\n\"Well, what is the source\nof this improvement?\"\nYou might not care what the source is\nbecause I could tell\nyou it's one brain area\nor another brain area.\nWhat difference would it make?\nBut again, if you can understand\nmechanism a little bit,\nyou're in a position to create newer\nand even better protocols.\nWhat mental rehearsal appears\nto do is engage the activity\nof those upper motor\nneurons that we talked about\nway back at the beginning of the episode.\nRemember you have upper motor neurons\nthat control deliberate action,\nyou've got lower motor\nneurons that actually\nconnect to the muscles\nand move those muscles\nand you have central pattern generators.\nMental rehearsal, closing\none's eyes typically\nand thinking about a\nparticular sequence of movement\nand visualizing it in one's \"mind's eye\"\ncreates activation of\nthe upper motor neurons\nthat's very similar if not the\nsame as the actual movement.\nAnd that makes sense because\nthe upper motor neurons\nare all about the command for movement.\nThey are not the ones that\nactually execute the movement.\nRemember, upper motor neurons are the ones\nthat generate the command for movement,\nnot the actual movement.\nThe ones that generate the actual movement\nare the lower motor neurons\nand the central pattern generators.\nSo visualization is a powerful tool.\nHow can you use visualization?\nWell, in this study, they\nhad people perform this\nfive days a week.\nI believe that it was 15.\nYes, it was 15 minutes\nper day, five days a week\nfor 12 weeks.\nSo that's a lot of mental rehearsal.\nIt's not a ton of time each\nday, 15 minutes per day.\nBut sitting down, closing your eyes\nand imagining going through\na particular skill practice\nor moving a weight.\nMaybe it's playing keys on\na piano if that's your thing\nor strings on a guitar,\nfor 15 minutes a day,\nfive days per week for\n12 weeks is considerable.\nI think most people, given the fact\nthat the actual practice,\nthe physical practice\nis going to lead to larger improvements,\ngreater improvements then\nwould the mental training\nwould opt for the actual\nphysical training.\nBut of course, if you're on a plane\nand you don't have access to your guitar\nand you're certainly not\ngoing to be sprinting\nup and down the aisle\nor you are very serious\nabout your craft and you want\nto accelerate performance\nof your craft or strength increases\nor something of that sort,\nthen augmenting or adding in\nthe visualization training\nvery likely will compound\nthe effects of the\nactual physical training.\nThere are not a lot of studies\nlooking at how visualization\non top of pure physical training\ncan increase the rates of learning\nand consolidation of learning, et cetera.\nIt's actually a hard study to\ndo because hard to control for\nbecause what would you do in its place.\nYou would probably add\nactual physical training\nand then that's always going\nto lead to greater effects.\nSo the point is if you want\nto use visualization training,\ngreat, but forget the idea\nthat visualization training\nis as good as the actual behavior.\nYou hear this all the time.\nPeople say, do you know that\nif you imagine an experience\nto your brain and to your body,\nit's exactly the same as\nthe actual experience.\nAbsolutely not.\nThis is not the way the\nnervous system works.\nI'm sorry, I don't mean\nto burst anybody's bubble,\nbut your bubble is made of myths.\nAnd the fact of the\nmatter is that the brain,\nwhen it executes a movement is generating\nproprioceptive feedback.\nAnd that proprioceptive\nfeedback is critically involved\nin generating our sense of the experience\nand in things like learning.\nSo I don't say this because\nI don't like the idea\nthat visualization couldn't work.\nIn fact visualization does work,\nbut it doesn't work as well,\nit doesn't create the same millu,\nthe same chemical millu,\nthe same environment\nas actual, physically\nengaging in the behavior,\nthe skill the resistance\ntraining, et cetera.\nAnd I'd be willing to\nwager that the same is true\nfor experiences of all kinds.\nPTSD is this incredibly\nunfortunate circumstance\nin which there's a replay\noften of the traumatic event\nthat feels very real.\nBut that's not to say\nthat the replay itself\nis the same as the actual event.\nAnd of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with\nwith the utmost level of\nseriousness, it should be treated.\nIn fact, my lab works on\nthese sorts of things,\nbut my point about visualization\nand imagining something\nnot being the same as\nthe actual experience\nis grounded in this\nidea of proprioception.\nAnd the fact that feedback\nto the cerebellum,\nthe cerebellum, talking to\nother areas of the brain\nare critically involved in communicating\nto the rest of our nervous system.\nThat not just that we believe\nsomething is happening\nbut something is actually happening.\nAnd in the case of muscle loads,\nmuscles actually feeling tension,\nthe actual feeling of\ntension in the muscle.\nThe contracting of the\nmuscle under that tension\nis part of the important\nadaptation process.\nIn a future episode, we'll\ntalk about hypertrophy\nand how that works at the\nlevel of upper motor neurons,\nlower motor neurons and muscle itself.\nBut for now just know that\nvisualization can work.\nIt doesn't work as well\nas real physical training\nand practice, but these effects of 35%\nor 13.5% increases are\npretty considerable.\nThey're just not as great\nas the 53% increases\nthat come from actual physical training.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin some of this skill\nlearning that more relates\nto musical training, but also\nhow cadence and metronomes\nand tones, et cetera, can\nsupport physical learning.\nIf you're interested in that,\nif are you a fussy and autos,\nthere is a wonderful\nreview, also published\nin the Journal Neuron\nagain, excellent journal\nby Herholz and Zatorre,\nthat's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z\nand Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E.\nThat really describes in\ndetail how musical training\ncan impact all sorts of different things\nand how cadence training,\nwhether or not with tones\nor auditory feedback\nand things of that sort\ncarries over to not just\ninstrumental music training\nbut also physical skill\nlearning of various kinds.\nSo if you want to do the deep dive,\nthat would be the place you\ncan find it easily online.\nIt's available as a complete article\nfree of charge, et cetera.\nMany of you are probably\nasking what can I take\nin order to accelerate skill learning?\nWell, the conditions are going to vary,\nbut motivation is key.\nYou have to show up to\nthe training session\nmotivated enough to focus your attention\nand to perform a lot of repetitions\nin the training sequence.\nThat's just a prerequisite.\nThere's no pill that's\ngoing to allow you to do\nfewer repetitions and\nextract more learning\nout of fewer repetitions.\nIt's actually more a question\nof what are the conditions\nthat you can create for yourself\nsuch that you can generate\nmore repetitions per unit time.\nI think that's the right\nway to think about it.\nWhat are the conditions\nthat you can create\nfor yourself in your mind and in your body\nthat are going to allow you to focus?\nAnd I've talked about focus and plasticity\nand motivation in previous episodes.\nPlease see those episodes if\nyou have questions about that.\nI've detailed a lot of tools\nin the underlying science.\nSo for some people, it might\nbe drinking a cup of coffee\nand getting hydrated before\nthe training session.\nFor some of you, it\nmight be avoiding coffee\nbecause it makes you too jittery\nand your attention jumps\nall over the place.\nIt's going to vary tremendously.\nThere is no magic pill\nthat's going to allow you\nto get more out of less, that's\njust not going to happen.\nIt's simply not going to happen.\nYou're not going to get more learning\nout of fewer repetitions or less time.\nHowever, there are a few compounds\nI think are worth mentioning\nbecause of their ability\nto improve the actual\nphysical performance,\nthe actual execution of\ncertain types of movements.\nAnd some of these have also been shown\nto improve cognitive function,\nespecially in older population.\nSo I'd be remiss if I didn't\nat least mention them.\nI'm only going to mention\none today in fact.\nThe one that's particularly interesting\nand for which there really\nare a lot of data is alpha GPC\nand I'm going to attempt to pronounce\nwhat alpha GPC actually is.\nIt's alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.\nAlpha GPC, alpha\nglycerylphosphorylcholine.\nSee, if I keep doing it\nover and over repetitions,\nalpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.\nThere I made an error.\nOkay, so the point is that alpha GPC,\nwhich is at least in the United States\nis sold over the counter\ntypically is taken in dosages\nof about 300 to 600 milligrams.\nThat's a single dose or\nhave been shown to do\na number of things that for\nsome of you might be beneficial.\nOne is to enhance power output.\nSo if you're engaging in\nsomething like Shotput throwing\nor resistance training or sprinting\nor something where you have\nto generate a lot of power,\nmaybe you're doing rock\nclimbing, but you're working\non a particular aspect\nof your rock climbing\nthat involves generating a\nlot of force, a lot of power.\nWell then in theory, alpha GPC\ncould be beneficial to you.\nFor the cognitive effects,\nthe dosages are much higher\nup to 1200 milligrams daily\ndivided into three doses\nof 400 milligrams is what the studies\nthat I was able to find show or used.\nThe effects on cognitive decline\nare described as notable.\nNotable, meaning several\nstudies showed a significant\nbut modest effect on in\noffsetting cognitive decline,\nin particular in older populations\nand some populations,\neven with some reported\nneuro degeneration.\nPower output was notable.\nHow notable, what does that mean, notable?\nA study noted a 14%\nincrease in power output.\nThat's pretty substantial, 14%.\nAnd if you think about it,\nbut it wasn't like a doubling\nor something of that sort.\nBelieve it or not, the\nsymptoms of Alzheimer's\nhave been shown at least\namong the nutraceuticals\nof which alpha GPC is to\nsignificantly improve cognition\nin people with Alzheimer's.\nNow this episode, isn't\nabout cognitive decline\nand longevity, we will talk about that,\nbut this is a so-called\nanother effect of alpha GPC.\nFat oxidation is increased by alpha GPC,\ngrowth hormone release\nis promoted by alpha GPC\nalthough to a small degree.\nSo as you can see, things\nlike alpha GPC in particular\nwhen they are combined\nwith low levels of caffeine\ncan have these effects of\nimproving power output,\ncan improve growth hormone release,\ncan improve fat oxidation.\nAll these things in theory\ncan support skill learning.\nBut what they're really\ndoing is they're adjusting\nthe foundation upon which\nyou are going to execute\nthese many, many repetitions.\nThe same thing would be\nsaid for caffeine itself.\nIf that's something that motivates you\nand gets you out of a chair to actually do\nthe physical training,\nthen that's something\nthat can perhaps improve or enhance\nthe rate of skill learning\nand how well you retain those skills.\nNow on a previous episode I talked about,\nand this was the episode on\nepinephrin on adrenaline.\nI talked about how for mental,\nfor cognitive learning,\nit makes sense to spike epinephrin,\nto bump epinephrin levels\nup adrenaline levels up\nafter cognitive learning.\nFor physical learning, it\nappears to be the opposite\nthat if caffeine is in your practice\nor if you decide to try alpha GPC\nthat you would want to do\nthat before the training,\ntake it before the training use it.\nIts effect should extend\ninto the training,\npresumably throughout, and then afterward\nif you're thinking about\nfollowing some of the protocols\nthat we discussed today,\nthat you would use\nsome sort of idle time\nwhere the brain can replay\nthese motor sequences in reverse.\nAnd then of course, you want to do things\nthat optimize your sleep.\nA lot of the questions I\nget are about how different\nprotocols and things that I described\nstart to collide with one another.\nSo let's say for instance,\nyou go to bed at 10:30\nand you're going to do your\nskill training at 9:30,\nwell, taking a lot of caffeine\nthen is not going to be\na good idea 'cause it's going\nto compromise your sleep.\nSo I'm not here to design\nthe perfect schedule for you\nbecause everyone's situation's vary.\nSo the things to optimize\nare repetitions, failures,\nmore repetitions, more failures\nat the offset of training.\nHaving some idle time that\ncan be straight into sleep\nor it could be simply letting\nthe brain just go idle\nfor five to 10 minutes, mean\nnot focusing on anything,\nnot scrolling, social media, not emailing,\nnot ideally not even talking\nto somebody just lying down\nor sitting quietly with your eyes closed\nletting those motor sequences replay.\nThen we talked about how one can come back\nfor additional training sessions,\nuse things like metronoming\nwhere you're queuing\nyour attention to some\nexternal cue, some stimulus,\nin this case, an auditory\nstimulus most likely\nand trying to generate more\nrepetitions per unit time.\nSo again, it's repetitions\nand errors, that's key.\nAnd then we also talked about some things\nthat you can do involving\ncerebellar neurophysiology\nto extend range of motion if\nthat's what's limiting for you\nor to use visualization\nto augment the practice\nor let's say your particular\nskill involves nice weather\nand it's raining or snowing outside\nand you can't get outside or thunderstorm,\nthen that's where visualization training\nmight be a good replacement\nunder those conditions.\nOr in most cases is going\nto be the kind of thing\nthat you're going to want to do\nin addition to the actual physical skill\nor strength training session done,\nat least in the study that we described\nfor 15 minutes a day, five days a week\nover a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.\nSo hopefully that makes it clear.\nToday we've covered a lot of mechanism.\nWe talked so much about the\ndifferent motor pathway,\ncentral pattern generator.\nSo you now are armed\nwith a lot of information\nabout how you generate movement.\nAnd I like to think that you're also armed\nwith a lot of information\nabout how to design protocols\nthat are optimized for\nyou or if you're a coach,\nfor your trainees in order to optimize\ntheir learning of skills various kinds.\nToday we focused almost\nentirely on motor skills,\nthings like musical\nskills or physical skills.\nThese have some overlap,\nthey're partially overlapping\nwith neuroplasticity, for\nlearning things like languages\nor math or engineering or\nneuroscience for that matter.\nBefore we depart, I just want to make sure\nthat I return to a concept,\nwhich is the ultradian cycle.\nUltradian cycles are\nthese 90 minute cycles\nthat we go through throughout\nsleep and wakefulness\nthat are optimal for\nlearning and attention.\nIn the waking state, they\nare the stages of sleep\nin which we have either\npredominantly slowey sleep\nor rem sleep.\nSome of you who have been\nfollowing this podcast\nfor a while might be asking,\nwell should a physical practice\nbe 90 minutes.\nThat's going to depend because\nwith physical practices,\noftentimes for instance,\nwith strength training,\nthat might be too long.\nYou're not going to be able to\ngenerate enough force output\nfor it to be worthwhile.\nFor golfing, I don't know.\nI've never played golf with\nall my friends that play golf,\nthey disappear onto the\ngolf course for many hours.\nSo I know there's a lot\nof walking and driving\nand other stuff, I even hear that somebody\ncarries your stuff around for\nyou sometimes, not always.\nBut it's going to differ.\nA four hour golf game,\nyou're probably not swinging\nthe golf club for four hours,\nso it's going to depend.\nI would say that the ultradian\ncycle is not necessarily\na good constraint for skill\nlearning in most cases.\nAnd I should say that for\nthose of you that are short\non time or have limited amounts of time,\n10 minutes of maximum repetitions,\nmaximum focus skill learning work is going\nto be very beneficial.\nWhereas two hours of kind of haphazard\nnot really focused work or\nwhere you're not generating\nvery many repetitions 'cause you're doing\nfew repetitions then you're\ntexting on your phone\nor pay attention to something else,\nthat's not going to be beneficial.\nIt's really about the density of training\ninside of a session.\nSo I think you should let the...\nWork toward maximal or\nnear maximum density\nof repetitions and failures\nprovided they're failures\nyou can perform safely in order\nto accelerate skill learning\nand don't let some\narbitrary or in this case,\nthe ultradian constraint prevent you\nfrom engaging in that practice.\nIn other words, get the work\nin, get as much work done\nas you can per unit time.\nAnd based on the science,\nbased on things that I've seen,\nbased on things that I'm now involved in\nwith various communities, you\nwill see the skill improve\nvastly at various stages.\nSometimes it's a little bit stutter start,\nit's not always a linear improvement\nbut you will see incredible\nimprovement in skill.\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\nand you're finding the\ninformation
