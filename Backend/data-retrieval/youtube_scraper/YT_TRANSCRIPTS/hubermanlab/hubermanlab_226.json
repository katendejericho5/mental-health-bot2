    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring you zero cost\nto consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nAnd keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood tests\nand the simple reason for that\nis that so many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate and\nlongterm health and wellbeing\ncan only be analyzed from blood.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can get additional\nlayers of information\nthat can really support your understanding\nabout what's going on deep\nunder the hood, so to speak\ninside your body and brain\nand what to do about it.\nAnd I think that's really\nwhere InsideTracker\nsets itself apart from\nother similar tests.\nWhat InsideTracker\noffers is, first of all,\nthey make the tests very easy.\nThey can come to your home to\ntake your blood and DNA test\nor you can go to a\ntesting center nearby you.\nThen you get the information back\nand rather than just getting information\nabout whether or not the\nlevels of various things\nare high or low,\nyou also get to find\nout what to do about it.\nSo it offers directives\nrelated to nutrition,\nto exercise and so forth.\nIt's really allow you to be in control\nof your overall health,\nboth where you are now\nand its long-term trajectory.\nWith InsideTracker, they\nalso have something which is\nit can give you a readout\nof your inner age.\nThey have something\ncalled the inner age test\nthat really compares your biological age\nto your chronological age,\nsomething that's of extreme\nimportance and interest\nbecause it has to do with\nlifespan or predicted lifespan.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nand if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker plans.\nUse the code Huberman at checkout.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans\nand use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep is a company that\nmakes mattresses and pillows\nideally suited to your sleep needs.\nI've been sleeping on a Helix mattress\nfor the last six months,\nand I can honestly say\nit's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.\nHelix Sleep has a quiz that can match you\nto the ideal mattress and pillows for you.\nIt's a quiz that takes\njust about two minutes,\nasks you questions like do\nyou tend to sleep on your side\nor your back on your stomach?\nOr maybe you don't know,\nwhether or not you tend to wake up\nfeeling too warm or too cold?\nVarious questions about your sleep habits.\nAt the end of that quiz,\nit matches you to a specific mattress\nthat's perfect for your sleep needs.\nFor me, it matched me to the dusk, D-U-S-K\nbecause I wanted a mattress\nthat wasn't too firm nor too soft\nand I really love the mattress.\nAs I mentioned, I've been\nsleeping terrifically well\never since I got that mattress.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minutes sleep quiz\nand they'll match you\nto a customized mattress\nand then you'll get up to\n$200 off all mattresses\nand you'll get two free pillows.\nThey have a 10 year warranty.\nYou get to try it out for a\nhundred nights, risk-free,\nif you don't like it, they'll\neven pick it up for free,\ntake it away but I really think you will,\nI certainly love mine.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Theragun.\nTheragun is a handheld\npercussive therapy device\nthat releases deep muscle tension.\nI first learned about\nTheragun on a lab expedition.\nWe're actually headed out to ocean\nwhere we were doing diving\nwith great white sharks,\nfilming those for our VR fear\nexperiments in the laboratory\nand it was very long days\nof carrying Pelican cases,\nthose are cases these hard\nplastic cases with equipment,\nit was diving, we were all\nsore and tired all the time.\nAnd someone had brought along a Theragun.\nIt was the first time I had seen one\nand pretty soon that thing\nwas getting passed along\nand became one of the more\ncoveted devices on board.\nEveryone wanted time with this\nthing because it was great,\nyou could give yourself\na really terrific massage\nand get deep into the\ntissue and relieve soreness.\nWhen I got back, I got a Theragun\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nWhether or not you want\nto treat your muscles\nbecause they're tense from working out\nor whether or not you just\nwant to release stress,\nit's a terrific tool.\nMany of you are familiar probably\nwith professional massages\nbut Theragun is\ninteresting because you can\nbasically give yourself\na deep tissue massage,\nanytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet.\nIf you want to try Theragun,\nyou can try it for 30 days.\nThey start at only $199.\nYou can go to\ntheragun.com/huberman right now\nand you can get your gen\nfourth Theragun today,\nthat's the one that I use or\nanother one of their models.\nThat's Theragun.com/huberman\nto try Theragun.\nThis episode marks the\nbeginning of a new topic\nfor the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nAs many of you already know,\nwe go deep into a\nparticular topic over four,\nsometimes even five episodes.\nWe just closed out the\nepisodes on hormones.\nNow we are going to talk\nabout how to optimize physical performance\nand skill learning.\nWe're going to look deep\nat the science behind this\nas well as specific practices.\nIn fact, today, you're going\nto hear about specific tools\nthat you can use to improve\nendurance and strength by up to,\nI'm not making this up,\nthree or four times your current capacity.\nThis is based on studies\nthat were done at Stanford\nand are currently in use\nby collegiate and professional teams.\nIf you're not a professional\nathlete or a serious athlete,\nthat's okay.\nThe topics, this month\nand all the information\nwe are going to cover\nare going to make you\na better recreational exerciser as well.\nIf you're not an exerciser\nand you're thinking\nabout getting into that\nor if you live in the Northern hemisphere\nand you're just thinking\nabout the beach this summer\nor fat loss, muscle\nbuilding, that sort of thing,\nthis month we're going to\ncover all of that as well.\nThere's so much confusion out there\nabout how to optimize fat\nloss, muscle building,\nimprovements in flexibility, for instance,\nor skill learning.\nI know many of you, aren't so focused\non the cosmetic aspects\nof physical exercise\nbut are interested in\nactual skill learning,\nwe're going to talk about that too.\nI want to just take a moment\nto reflect on something\nthat came up last episode.\nIf you didn't see that episode,\nthat's quite all right.\nBut last episode, we were talking\nabout the hormones,\nadrenaline, and cortisol\nand how to leverage those\ntowards attention and learning\nand there was a little bit of confusion\nthat I want to clarify.\nI mentioned an optimal\nprotocol for learning\nthat involves leveraging\nadrenaline also called epinephrin\nand it involved four steps.\nThe four steps that I spelled out\nwere to be calm and focused\nwhile one is trying to acquire\nor learn the new skill,\ncognitive skill or motor skill,\nthen to have a spike in adrenaline.\nI mentioned ways to do that,\nusing cold or breathing or other tools,\nimmediately after the learning episode\nthen to incorporate what I\ncall non sleep deep rest,\na 20 minute episode of a shallow\nnap or some other protocol\nlike NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol\nof which we always provide\nlinks in the captions.\nAnd then to try and optimize\nsleep later that night\nand the subsequent night.\nSome of you heard this\nand it sunk in right away\nand it was straight forward.\nOthers said, wait, I thought\nfrom a previous episode\neven before that, you said you're supposed\nto do non sleep deep rest\nimmediately after learning, no.\nWe added another step,\nthe logic still follows\nthat you want to be calm\nand focused during learning,\nthen you want to spike\nadrenaline at the end.\nMost people get that backward,\nthey're drinking too much coffee\nor even taking nootropics and things,\ntrying to be really\nfocused while learning.\nSome people are taking\nAdderall recreationally\nsomething I don't recommend,\nthat's actually getting\nthe whole process backwards\nif you look at the data in the physiology.\nYou want to spike adrenaline at the end\nor immediately after a learning episode\nand then non sleep deep rest\nand then sleep itself, okay?\nFour steps, hope that\nclarifies things for you,\nif you have any additional questions\nplease put them in the\ncomment section below.\nOkay, so let's talk about\nphysical performance.\nThere are so many variables\nto physical performance\nand we can manage physical\nperformance and skill learning\nfrom a variety of contexts.\nI made just a short list\nof some of the things\nthat come to mind that\ncan powerfully impact\nphysical performance and skill learning.\nSome of them are what I\nwould consider foundational.\nThey allow you to show\nup your current ability\nand if you were to disrupt those,\nyou would perform less well.\nSo things like getting\na good night's sleep,\nthings like being properly hydrated,\nthings like being well nourished,\nwhatever that means to you.\nI know some of you like\nto exercise fasted,\nsome of you prefer to\nhave food in your stomach\nor have eaten a couple hours before.\nThere are supplements, there are drugs,\nthere are different ways to breathe,\nthere are so many tools related\nto mindset, visualization,\nthere are machines and devices,\nit's just a vast space,\nbut it's not infinite.\nAnd there are a few things\nin the list of things\nthat can impact and even\noptimize physical performance\nand skill learning that\nhave an outsized effect\nthat any of you can use.\nMany of them, most of them\nare low to zero costs.\nSo today we are going to\nfocus on what I believe to be\none of the most powerful tools\nto improve physical performance\nand skill learning and recovery\nand we'll talk about why that's important\nand that's temperature.\nNow many of you might think,\noh, well that's kind of boring,\nI want to know about the\nmagic pill that I can take\nthat's going to allow\nme to dunk a basketball\nif I currently can't or I\nwant to know about the thing\nthat's going to let me\nrun further and faster\nis going to shed fat.\nBelieve it or not, temperature\nis the most powerful variable\nfor improving physical\nperformance and for recovery.\nI would argue it's even\nmore important than sleep\nbecause temperature itself\nis going to dictate how well\nand when you sleep and the\ndepth of your total recovery.\nThere are two aspects to\ntemperature of course,\nthere's heat and there's cold.\nWe are mainly going to focus on cold\nas a way to buffer heat.\nIn a previous podcast episode,\nI talked all about growth hormone.\nYou can find that episode about\nfibroid and growth hormone\nand how heat can be a powerful stimulus\nfor increasing growth hormone\nwhich is involved in\ntissue repair and et cetera\nand burn fat and improve\nmetabolism in various ways.\nHowever, cold I would argue\nis even more powerful than heat as a tool\nand I'm not just talking\nabout putting ice packs\non sore muscles or slightly\nsprained limbs and ankles\nand things of that sort.\nWe're going to talk about cold\nfrom the standpoint of thermal physiology.\nThis is a literature that's\nrich in scientific information\nthat goes back very deep\ninto the last century\nwhere physiologists and\nneuroscientists figured out\nthat there are different\ncompartments in your body\nthat heat and cool you differently\nand that you can leverage\nthose in order to double\nand as I mentioned before\neven triple or quadruple your work output\nboth strength, repetitions, and endurance.\nSo this is not weak sauces that they say,\nthis is the stuff that can\nreally shift the needle quite a bit\nand it's not just about well once,\nit's about being able to\nperform well and recover\nfrom that performance so\nthat you do even better\nwhen you're not incorporating these tools\non days where for instance,\nyou can't access cold\nor an ice pack or an ice bath\nor things of that sort, okay?\nSo we're going to cover cold,\nwe're going to talk a little bit\nabout the physiology of cold\nand heat and how they work\nbecause as you've probably\nheard me say before\nif you can understand some mechanism,\nif you can just push yourself\nthrough a little bit of new knowledge,\ninto understanding a\nlittle bit of mechanism\nabout how you work, you'll\nbe in a far better position\nto implement the tools in the\nbest and most flexible ways\nfor your needs.\nThis is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nI never ever do a just list of the things\nthat you should do.\nI don't believe in that,\njust tell me what to do.\nFirst, I tell you why\nyou should do something.\nWhat's the logical framework\nthat it's grounded in\nand then we distill that\ndown to specific protocols.\nFor those of you that are\ntoo impatient for that,\nthere are millions, if not billions\nof other resources out\nthere that will take you\ninto the cul-de-sac of one\nprotocol that will work\nand then stop working or might\nwork for you indefinitely,\nthat's not how we work here.\nThis is about really\nunderstanding the mechanism\nso that you can tweak\nthings and modify things,\nadjust the timing and the dosage of things\nand really get the most out\nof these tools and protocols.\nEverything I'm going to talk about\npertains to both endurance exercise\nand strength and speed type exercise.\nSo sprints, weightlifting, endurance work\nand to some extent, flexibility\nbut we're going to cover\nflexibility in depth\nas well as another feature\nthat's not often talked about\nwhich is suppleness or\nsmoothness of movement\nover different ranges of\nmovement in a subsequent episode.\nLet's start by talking about temperature.\nWhat is temperature?\nHow does temperature impact the body\nand its ability to perform,\nincluding learn new skills?\nSo everyone probably remembers,\nor has at least heard of\nthe word homeostasis, right?\nThat the body wants to remain\nin a particular range of temperatures,\nthat it doesn't like to\nbe too hot or too cold.\nAnd I want to emphasize from the outset\nthat there are many mechanisms\nthat are installed into us\nby way of our evolutionary\ndesign and our genome\nmeaning we were just born\nwith this stuff ready\nto keep our body temperature\nin a particular narrow range.\nHeating up too much is just plain bad.\nIt's not just bad for\nphysical performance,\nit's bad for all tissue health.\nIf your brain heats up too\nmuch, neurons start dying\nand those neurons don't come back, okay?\nYou may have heard about neurogenesis,\nthe ability for the brain\nto regenerate itself\nor generate new neurons and adulthood,\nthere's very little neurogenesis\nexcuse me, in adulthood,\neven after anytime after puberty really\nand you don't want to lose neurons\nin the central nervous system.\nIf you get too hot, that'll happen.\nIt's called hyperthermia, you\nwant to avoid hyperthermia\nand you have many mechanisms\nthat are built into you to\navoid becoming hyperthermic.\nThe other thing that\nhappens when we get too warm\nis that we have in all of our cells,\nwhat are called enzymes.\nYou generally know if\nsomething's an enzyme\nbecause it ends in the\nletters, A-S-E, right?\nSo lipase is an enzyme\nthat exists to digest fats.\nYou have proteases that are\nthere to digest proteins, right?\nSo anytime you see A-S-E\nchances are it's an enzyme.\nEnzymes are proteins, and they\nhave a particular structure\nand their structure becomes\nmodified when heat increases\nand that's not good.\nYou want their structure\nto be of a particular type.\nImagine a car with four wheels,\nlet's just say the car is the enzyme.\nIf it gets too hot, it's like\ntwo of the wheels fall off\nand that thing can't function.\nSo one of the reasons\nwhy the body and nature\ngoes through so much effort\nto build in mechanisms\nto make sure that we don't become too warm\nis because when we get to warm,\nthese enzymes don't function,\ncells stop functioning,\nthey stop being able to generate energy,\nthey stop being able to digest things,\nyou stop being able to think\nand eventually those cells\nstart dying off entirely.\nSo keeping temperature in a\nparticular range is really good,\nyou don't want to get too hot.\nWe have much more flexibility\nin terms of getting cold.\nNow you don't want to\nbecome hypothermic either.\nYou can die from hypothermia\njust like you can die from hyperthermia.\nHowever that you have a\nlot more range to be cold\nthan you do to be too warm, okay?\nAnd in general, the idea is\nto keep the body and brain\nin a particular range but\nanytime we do anything,\nour body temperature can shift.\nSo for instance, if you were\nto stand next to a campfire\nor you were outside on a hot day,\nvarious things would happen\nto dump heat from your body.\nIf you were outside on a cold day\nor you were to get into a\ncold shower or a cold lake,\nvarious things would happen\nto insulate heat within your body.\nThis is all pretty straightforward\nand obvious I realize.\nNow, what are those things?\nWell, there are a huge category of them.\nWhen you get into cold water,\nyou secrete adrenaline.\nOn a hot day, if it's really\nhot or in a very hot sauna\nor in the hot desert,\nyou will generate what are\ncalled heat shock proteins\nwhich will set off other sets of cascades,\nmetabolic cascades, biological cascades.\nBut the simplest way to think\nabout this process is that\nwhen we get cold, we\ntend to vasoconstrict.\nOur blood vessels tend to constrict\nand we tend to push energy\ntoward the core of our body\nto preserve our core organs, okay?\nSo our periphery, our hands\nand our feet and our toes\nand our legs become colder\nand our core therefore can\nmaintain blood to that area\nand we are insulating our core.\nConversely, when we heat up\nour blood vessels vasodilate,\nthey expand a bit and more\nblood flows to our periphery\nand more blood can move\nthroughout the body generally\nand we will perspire, we will\nsweat, water will actually\nget pulled out of the\nblood to some extent,\nmoved up through sweat glands\nand will be brought to the skin surface\nso that it can be dumped,\nwe are dumping heat.\nAnimals, as you know vary\nin their capacity to sweat.\nSome animals like camels\nwon't start sweating at first\nif they heat up, what\nthey'll do is they'll spit,\nthey'll dump heat by spitting, okay?\nDogs pant, Castilla is\noff to my left here,\nhe pants when he gets\ntoo warm, he can't sweat\nor dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.\nBut we can sweat and\nyou've probably noticed\nthat on a humid hot day,\nyou'll feel much warmer\njust walking or running than you would\nwith the equivalent exercise or movement\nthan you would on a cold day.\nAnd some of you probably\nknow this, but if you don't\nthe reason is you sweat on a cold day,\nbut because the air is dry typically,\nyou will bring that sweat to the surface\nand provided you're wearing clothes\nthat allow some air to get\nout away from the body,\nso you're not wearing,\nyou know, really tight,\nyou know spandex type clothing\nor something like that,\nor, you know seal type\nsaran wrap type clothing\nthat sweat will evaporate\noff into the dry atmosphere.\nWhereas on a humid day,\nthe reason you see people\nin New York and Florida\non a humid summer day\nand they're like moving\ntheir shirts off themselves\nand you see people with, you know\nbig sweat stains and back sweat stains\nand all this kind of stuff\nis because they're sweating\nas they normally would, but it's humid\nand so there is the humidity,\nthe air doesn't allow transfer\nof that sweat into the\natmosphere as readily\nand so you're hot, okay?\nSo without the evaporation,\nyou're going to be warmer.\nSo we evaporate off sweat, we sweat\nand we vasodilate when\nwe want to dump heat.\nWhen we want to maintain\nheat, we vasoconstrict\nand we tend to not sweat.\nThe other thing that happens\nis you'll get goosebumps.\nSo-called goose pimples\nthey're sometimes called.\nThose are a throwback to the time\nwhere we had fur over\nmost, not all of our body.\nAll mammals in the cold have a process\nwhereby adrenaline is\nreleased at low levels\ntypically into the body,\nthat adrenaline activates\nwhat are called sympathetic fibers,\nthey have nothing to do with sympathy,\nthose little fibers, which are neurons,\nthose fibers that what I'm\nsaying are fibers are neurons,\nnot clothing fibers,\nreach up into the skin\nso your whole body is covered\nwith these little tiny neurons\nthat reach up into the\nskin and when we are cold,\nthey actually mechanically\ntake the hair follicle\nand bend it up, it's a\nprocess called pilo erection,\nP-I-L-O erection, okay?\nSo on a hot day, you\nwant to dump heat, okay?\nSo on a hot day, what would happen is\nyou'd actually not see those goose pimples\nbecause you want the hairs lying down\nwhich actually you would think\nthat might insulate you more\nbut we'll actually let\nmore heat dissipate out\nthrough the skin.\nOn a cold day, you get these\ngoose pimples or goosebumps\nwhich are really just\nan ancient carry over\nfrom the body's attempt to\nmake hair stand up on end.\nAnd when hair step stand up on end\nand they're very close together\nthat traps air in between\nthem and actually creates\na sort of insulated blanket of warm air.\nIf you've ever seen an animal\nlike a a Malamute or a Husky,\nyou might think, oh that\npoor thing on a hot day,\nwhat does it do?\nYou know, with all that hair?\nWell, it can be warm so the\nanimal will typically pant\nand its hair will lay down,\nwhich you might think would act\nas more of a blanket, but on a cold day\nwhat'll happen is they'll\nbecome very puffy.\nTheir hair will stand up on end\nand that's actually trapping\nheat between the hairs\nand they're actually quite well insulated.\nSo it's very important that\nif you want to understand\nhow you can leverage temperature\nfor physical performance,\nyou have to understand\nthat you have vasoconstriction\nto conserve heat,\nvasodilation to dump heat,\nthat you are sweating to dump heat,\nand you have conservation of fluids\nin order to preserve heat.\nThat's the most important thing\nin terms of understanding the mechanisms\nof maintaining and dumping heat.\nAnd now the most important\nthing to understand is that\nif you get too hot, not only\ndo those enzymes stop working\nbut your ability to contract\nyour muscles stops, okay?\nI'm going to repeat this\nbecause it's vitally important.\nATP is involved in the process\nof generating muscle contractions,\nit doesn't matter if\nyou're running a marathon,\ndoesn't matter if you're\ndoing a yoga class,\ndoesn't matter if you're\ngoing for a 700 pound squat,\nthe range of temperatures\nwithin which ATP can function\nand muscles can contract is very narrow.\nSomewhere around 39 or 40\ndegrees Celsius, it drops off\nand you will not be able to\ngenerate more contractions.\nNow that's pretty hot,\nbut that temperature\ncan be generated locally really fast.\nNow, if you're too cold,\nit's true it's hard to\ngenerate muscle contractions.\nI got into doing some cold water\nswimming a little while ago\nand we would joke that, you\nknow, you come out of the water,\nwe do no wetsuits,\nI'm not recommending\npeople do this necessarily\nunless you're with certainly\nwith somebody else who's skilled\nat doing it, which I was.\nAnd you come out\nand you feel like you\nhave claws for hands.\nYou can, you know, you\ncould never text on a phone\nfor the first few minutes,\nI mean, the water was very, very cold\nand you can't even move your face\nand so muscles will become rigid\nbut heating up muscles causes\nthem to fail to be able\nto generate more contractions.\nPut simply if you get too\nhot, you stop exercising.\nYou may not even realize it\nbut your will to exercise further,\nyour ability to push harder\nis entirely dependent on\nthe heat of the muscle\nboth locally and your whole system.\nSo let's talk about your whole system\nbecause I just described heat\ndumping and heat maintaining.\nI told you that increasing heat\nmakes it hard for muscles to contract.\nIt will stop you from being\nable to run further and faster,\nit will stop you from being\nable to lift more weights,\nmore sets, more repetitions.\nIf you can keep temperature\nin range however,\nin a proper range, you will\nbe able to do more work,\nyou will be able to create greater output,\nyou'll be able to lift more\nweight, more sets, more reps\nand you'll be able to run further.\nNow, there are data that I'm going to talk\nabout in a little bit that\nare absolutely striking\nthat underscore that statement.\nThere are data from my\ncolleague Craig Heller's lab\nin the department of biology at Stanford\nand there are data that\nare now being implemented.\nThey were first implemented\nin a grant funded by DARPA\nbut now in professional sports teams.\nMany, if not all the NFL teams\nare now using this technology\nas well as military uses it\nand not just for sports\nperformance, but also firefighters,\nconstruction workers, other professions\nwhere elevated heat becomes\na barrier to performance\nand you can leverage this to\nreally improve your workouts.\nAnd when I say really\nimprove, it is striking.\nI'm going to give away a\nlittle hint of this now\nand then I'm going to\ntell you a little bit more\nof the data later after\nI tell you the protocols.\nProper cooling of the body,\nwhich has to be done\nin a very specific way,\nhas allowed recreational athletes,\ncollege students and typical adults\nas well as professional athletes\nto go from doing their usual output.\nIn this case what comes to mind best\nwould be a particular\nprofessional athletes\nthat a member of the 49ers at the time\nwas able to do 40 dips on\nhis first set, 30, 20, 20,\nbasically to 10 sets of dips\nunassisted with anything else.\nThat's an impressive\nespecially since he's a really large guy,\n40 dips is as a respectable,\nthese are strict, full, full range dips.\nAnd then by the 10th set,\nthere's a steep drop-off.\nUsing proper cooling of\nparticular body compartments,\nhe was able to triple that\nwithin less than a week\nand maintain that performance\neven without the cooling approach.\nSo it was actually a\nconditioning effect, all right?\nI'll get back to this in a little bit\nbut there are other\nfantastic leaps of effort\nand leaps of performance\nthat were demonstrated\nincluding endurance running.\nBefore I continue any, I\njust want to underscore again\nthat overheating is terrible.\nThere's a famous example of this.\nThis was about 10, 15 years ago\nwhen a number of dietary supplements\nthat included things like\nepinephrin which is a stimulant,\nit's a beta adrenergic stimulant,\ndrugs like Clenbuterol,\nwhich were then banned from the Olympics,\nwhich are still out there\nhave been in recreational use\nwhich were beta adrenergic\nagonist so these are drugs\nthat sort of mimic epinephrin\nadrenaline to some extent,\nI know I'm oversimplifying this here.\nThey improve flat loss because\nof the effects on metabolism\nbut they heat up the body.\nAnd what happened was, this\nhit the press very widely\nis high school football players\nand various professional\nathletes were dropping dead\nbecause they were overheating\nduring practice or in competition.\nSo much so that Clenbuterol was banned.\nAlthough every once in a while,\nsomebody gets in trouble for using this,\nthere was an incidence of this recently\nin professional boxing which\nwas attributed to a bad meat\nthat had contained the Clenbuterol.\nI don't know what the source was,\nI don't have any commentary about that,\nbut it still is in use,\nbut these drugs increased\nbody temperature,\nincreased fat loss, but\ncarry is severe danger\nand that's the danger of hyperthermia.\nIn fact, I would argue and I\nthink in talking to some folks\nat in various professional\nfighting organizations\nit's very clear that a lot\nof the deaths that one sees\nin professional combat\nsports may have to do\nas much with dehydration and overheating\nas it does with getting hit in\nthe head, which is also bad,\nbut that things can compound\nthat can have a synergistic effect.\nAnd just a note about\nthat and hyperthermia\nand it's dangerous as well.\nMy first project ever in science\nwas to evaluate the thermogenic\neffects of MDMA or ecstasy.\nThat was my senior thesis\nin college actually.\nAnd what we found was that indeed drugs\nthat remove your understanding\nof how warm you are\ncause you to not take on\nthe appropriate behaviors\nto cool yourself, right?\nSo your vasoconstriction\nand you're sweating,\nthose are autonomic,\nthose are going to happen no matter what\nunless you happen to take\nsomething that blocks that effect.\nHowever, there are a lot of things\nthat we as humans do to prevent\nourselves from overheating\nand the main one is stop.\nWhen we are running in the desert\nor when we're running very\nhard and suddenly we stop,\noftentimes that's because\nthe muscles are overheating,\nit's a subconscious thing.\nWe won't often think, oh,\nI'm really much too warm,\nit's just that we stop\nand it's a self-preservation mechanisms.\nSometimes it kicks into early,\nsometimes it kicks into late.\nKicks in too late, you can die.\nThere's an instance in the 1984 Olympics\nwhere there was the first year I believe\nthat there was a women's marathon,\nI think that's correct.\nAnd one of the front runners\nor top picks for winning\nwas heading into the stadium\nand all of a sudden, it\nseemed as if she was lost,\nshe was kind of wandering around\nnot knowing where she should go\nand in fact, she was in a position to win\nor at least take second\nplace, at least take silver,\ngot totally disoriented and\ndid miserably in the race\nand she was hyperthermic,\nshe was running against\nthat reflex to stop.\nSo dumping heat is key.\nSo how do you dump heat in\norder to perform longer safely?\nWell, in order to understand\nthat you have to understand\nthat the body has three main compartments\nfor regulating temperature, okay?\nWe don't just have a\ncenter and a periphery,\nwe have three main compartments\nand there's one compartment in particular\nthat all of you or most all\nof you, I have to assume have\nand if you can understand how that works,\nyou can do tremendous\nthings for your performance\nand for your recovery.\nSo what I'm about to tell you\nwill allow you to perform\nbetter in all forms of exercise\nand it is not commonly known,\nunfortunately, I'm here\nto try and change that.\nYou have three compartments\nfor increasing or dumping\nheat in your body.\nOne is your core, we\nalready talked about that.\nYour core organs, your heart,\nyour lungs, your pancreas, your liver,\nthis is the core of your body.\nThe other is your periphery,\nwhich are obviously your arms\nand your legs and your\nfeet and your hands.\nBut then there's a third component\nwhich has their three\nlocations on your body\nthat are far better at\npassing heat out of the body\nand bringing cool into the body\nsuch that you can heat up\nor cool your body everywhere very quickly.\nThose three areas are your\nface, the palms of your hands\nand the bottoms of your feet.\nNow, the skin on your hands\nand on the bottoms of your feet\nand to some extent on your\nface are called glaborous skin.\nThat's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S glaborous skin.\nAnd what's special about\nthose areas of your body\nand the glaborous skin\nis that the arrangement\nof vasculature, of blood\nvessels, capillaries and arteries\nthat serve those regions is very different\nthan it is elsewhere in your body.\nNow, this has ancient roots.\nTypically, if you were\nanother mammal, like a bear\nor some sort of ape, you would\nhave hair all over your body.\nNow we all know some pretty hairy people.\nI presume you've heard that\nthere are these hairy people,\nI know a few excessively hairy people\nand Castilla is excessively hairy\nbut he's not a person obviously\nbut all mammals have hair\non their bodies, too.\nSome people have very light\nhair or very fine hair.\nWe don't have hair on these\nglaborous skin regions.\nNow, of course you can have\nbeard or facial hair growth\nbut there are still\nregions like the cheeks\nand other areas that maintain\nthis special vasculature.\nOkay, so technically the hands and feet\nare real glaborous skin\nand the face is not always\nquite classified as glaborous\nbut these three locations\nface, palms of hands\nnot tops and bottoms of feet\nare very good at dumping heat\nand bringing in cool.\nAnd the reason is there's\na rule in vascular biology\nthat blood moves from\narteries to capillaries\nand then to veins, and then\nback to the heart, okay?\nSo arteries which are\nthe big ones obviously,\ncapillaries which are the little fine ones\nwhere oxygen and carbon\ndioxide are exchanged\nand veins which then bring\nblood back to the heart\nand other tissues of course.\nIn these three regions\nof your hands, your face\nand the bottoms of your feet,\nwe have what are called AVAs.\nAVAs are a very special\npattern of vasculature.\nAVAs are described in\nthe medical textbooks.\nYou can find them in Grey's anatomy\nnot the television show\nbut the actual Grey's anatomy textbook\nwhich is a real thing that exists\nand in all medical textbooks, okay?\nSo let's talk about AVAs and what they are\nand why they allow these\nthree regions of the body\nto heat or cool ourselves more readily.\nSo what are AVAs?\nAVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis.\nSo if you want to look that up\nyou can just look up\nAVAs veins, capillaries,\narteries if you like, but\nI'll spell it for you.\nA-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio\nvenous, V-E-N-O-U-S,\narterio-venous anastomosis,\nA-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.\nArterio-venous anastomosis, okay?\nYou want to know about\nArterio-venous anastomosis, trust me\nand you want to remember\nthat they are in your hands,\nthe bottoms of your feet and on your face,\nand in particular on\nthe palms of your hands,\nnot the tops of your hands.\nNow, before I said blood flows typically\nfrom arteries to capillaries, to veins,\nand then back to the heart.\nBut AVAs are direct connections\nbetween the small arteries\nand the small veins.\nThey bypass the\ncapillaries to some extent.\nThey are little short vessel segments,\nthey have a big, large inner diameter\nand they have this very\nthick, muscular wall.\nAnd they get input from what\nare called adrenergic neurons.\nThey get input from neurons\nthat release norepinephrine\nand epinephrine,\nwhich allows them to contract or dilate.\nNow there's some rules of physics\nthat talk about how the radius of a pipe\nand small changes in the radius of a pipe\nleads to massive increases in\nthe rate and amount of stuff\nthat can flow through that pipe, okay?\nThere's a rule of physics\nthat says essentially\nthat the radius is proportional\nto the amount of stuff\nthat can flow through\nsomething to the fourth power.\nWe're not going to make\nthis a physics class,\nbut if you want to look that up, you can,\nyou can just look up how\ndoes the radius of a tube\nor pipe relate to how quickly\nor how much stuff can flow through it?\nWhat you need to know,\neven if you don't want to know\nany of the underlying physics\nis that these AVAs allow more heat\nto leave the body more quickly\nand more cool to enter\nthe body more quickly\nthan other venous arterial capillary beds\nthroughout the body.\nIn other words, you can heat\nup best at the face, the palms\nand the bottoms of the feet,\nand you can cool down best\nat the face, the palms and\nthe bottoms of the feet\nthan you can anywhere else on your body.\nAnd when I say heat up or cool down,\nI mean actually heat or cool\nthe core end your brain.\nOkay, so this is vitally important.\nI realize we're getting down\ninto the mechanistic weeds\nhere, but you need to know\nthat these three\ncompartments of your body,\npalms, bottoms of feet and face\nare your best leverage points\nfor manipulating temperature\nto vastly improve physical\nperformance, okay?\nI also want to point out\nthat the work that I'm\ngoing to tell you about\nis not work from my laboratory.\nIt's the work of, as I mentioned,\nmy colleague Craig Heller's\nlaboratory at Stanford\nand we're going to have\nCraig on as a guest\nto talk more about these discoveries,\nthey are his and his\ncolleagues discoveries\nand how you can leverage them.\nThey're building out\nsome amazing technology.\nI had a conversation with Craig yesterday\nas a prelude to this episode\nand to the future conversation with him\nso you're getting the\nvery latest on this topic.\nSo what Craig and his colleagues did\nreally illustrates perfectly\nwhat these body surfaces can do and why.\nThey were studying overheating\nin athletes and in military\nand in construction workers\nand trying to prevent it.\nAnd they did a bunch of experiments,\nI won't go into all of them now\nbut what they essentially found\nwas that cooling the palms,\npalmer cooling allowed people, athletes,\nand recreational athletes\nto run much further,\nto lift more weight and\nto do more sets and reps\nto a absolutely staggering degree.\nLet's talk for a second, a\nbit more about why we stop,\nwhy we shut off effort when we get too hot\nbecause in doing so,\nyou'll really understand\nhow and why the best protocols exist\nfor being able to do more work,\nto be able to exercise longer\nand actually to feel good doing it.\nYou actually can make\na doubling of your dips\nor believe it or not a\ntripling or quadrupling or more\nof your pull-ups fairly straightforward.\nI mentioned before that\nwhen muscle heats up,\nenzymes start getting disrupted\nand ATP and muscles can't work so well\nand those muscles can't contract.\nLet's get a little more\nspecific about that.\nThe enzyme that's involved here\nis something called pyruvate kinase.\nYou don't need to know\nabout pyruvate kinase\nbut what you do need to\nknow is that it ends A-S-E\nwhich means it's an\nenzyme and pyruvate kinase\nis essentially a rate limiting step.\nIt's a critical step that you can't bypass\nif you want muscles to contract\nand it's very temperature sensitive.\nTherefore, if you can\nkeep temperature lower,\nyou can do more work per unit time,\nyou can do more pull-ups\nand that actually was done by Craig\nand his colleagues, excuse me.\nThe pull-ups weren't\nactually done by Craig,\nI don't know how many\npull-ups Craig can do,\nI'll ask him next time,\nboth cooled and uncooled,\nhow many pullups he can do.\nBut what they essentially did\nis they brought someone\ninto their laboratory\nwho could do 10 pull ups on the first set\nand they were able to get 10,\nrest two or three minutes get another 10,\nrest or three minutes and\nif you've ever tried this,\nwhat you find is that you start dropping\nto eight, seven, six, et cetera.\nNow, the person might not necessarily feel\nlike they're overheating,\nbut the muscle is heating up.\nThen with their knowledge that these AVAs,\nthat these that these portals\nin the palms are a great way\nto both heat the body, but also\nto dump heat from the body,\nthey used the device\nand I'll talk about\nwhat you can do at home\nbut a device where they had people hold on\nto what was essentially a cold tube.\nNow this is crucial, the\ntube can't be so cold\nthat it causes vasoconstriction\nbecause then the cold\nwon't pass from the tube\nto the hand and to the core.\nBut if it's the right temperature,\nit's neither too hot nor too cold,\nthat cool from the cold\ntube passes into the hand,\nthese so-called palmer regions\nand then cools the core\nand in theory by lowering body temperature\nwould allow the person or\nthe athlete to do more work\nand indeed that's what they saw.\nThe actual data, the specific data showed\nthat subjects could do,\nat least the subjects they worked with,\non their first day with no\ncooling about a hundred pull-ups\nacross the timeframe that they had, okay?\nSo it might've taken\nanywhere from 10 to 15\nor maybe more sets depending\non how skilled that person was\nbut in a fixed amount of time.\nThen they came back and did the cooling.\nThey did it the very next day\nwhich if you've ever trained a muscle,\nthe very next day typically\nyou wouldn't do as well in its training\nif it took any damage\nfrom the previous session\nor you at least do as well,\nbut you probably wouldn't\ndo what they then observed,\nwhich was, they started\nafter every other set,\nthe person would just hold the cold tube,\ncool down the body after every other set,\nrest everything else was kept the same\nand they found that they\nwent to 180 pull-ups,\nwhich is incredible, it's a near doubling.\nAnd by doing this repeatedly\nover several sessions,\nover several weeks, they quickly\nwent in the cooling group\nfrom a maximum of somewhere\nbetween 180 and 200 as I recall,\nI'm sort of estimating now,\nto 600 pull-ups in the\nequivalent amount of time\nwhich is absolutely incredible.\nThey then repeated this in\na study on the bench press\nand actually the bench press\nstudy was pretty interesting\nbecause they actually had a control group\nthat was admittedly\ntaking specific amounts\nof anabolic steroids,\nthe antibiotic steroid\nwas testosterone cypionate\nwhich is essentially testosterone,\nand indeed the testosterone cypionate,\nthe steroid group improved at\na rate of about 1% per week.\nThere were differences\nand the cooling group\nbasically left all other\ngroups in the dust,\nit was just remarkable.\nSo cooling the core, I\nwant to be very clear\nthat it's not cooling the muscle,\nwasn't about cooling the chest alone\nor just cooling the palms,\nit was about allowing cold\nto pass through the palms\nbecause of the unique vasculature\nthat's there, these AVAs\nallowed the subjects to do\nfar more work per unit time.\nAnd the important thing is that\nif they were to come back\nafter doing 600 pull-ups\nor 500 pull-ups, you might say,\nwell, wow that's going\nto create a situation\nwhere recovery is going to\nbe absolutely impossible.\nThey could come back, not use the cooling\nand they still saw a\nhighly significant increase\nin the amount or the\nnumber of pull-ups or dips\nor bench press weight\nthat they could do, okay?\nSo what that meant is that\nit was both an excellent performance\nand an excellent training stimulus\nthat they were able to recover from, okay?\nI don't know if all of\nyou are following this\nbut these are the sorts of increases\nin exercise output that\nare absolutely staggering\nand that's why professional\nteams and the military\nand others capitalized on them\nvery quickly and use these.\nOkay, now you may be asking\nwhat about endurance, right?\nNot everyone wants to be\nable to bench press a lot\nfor multiple reps and sets.\nAnd I should just mention\nfor the bench pressing,\nit was, I believe they were\nthey found people that\ncould bench press two 25,\nso that's two 45 pound plates\non the 45 pound standard Olympic bar\nfor repetitions of anywhere from six to 10\nand then they had them do the same thing.\nThey did a set, they'd\nrest two or three minutes,\nsometimes up to four minutes,\nthen do another set,\nrepeat, repeat, repeat,\nand with cooling, they were able\nto increase the amount of work,\nthe number of reps with the same weight.\nSometimes they did have to increase sets\nto approximately double,\nso it was pretty fantastic.\nSo with endurance, similar\nincreases have been shown\nand the way that they do those tests\nare a little bit different\nand they also point to a\nreally important mechanism\nof why we stopped doing work at all\nwhen we perceive that we are\nputting in too much effort.\nSo it gets right to the\nheart of the relationship\nbetween temperature in\nmuscle and your willpower,\nthose are directly related.\nYour body heat and your willpower\nare linked in a physiological way.\nSo I'm not talking about the kind of stuff\nthat you see as kind of like\nclickbait on the internet,\nor like increase willpower\nnow or become resilient now,\nor never do this again if you\nwant to be mentally strong,\nI'm talking about a\nphysiological mechanism\nthat exists in the body and\nbrain that causes you to stop\nor that will allow you to\ncontinue to go harder and further\nthan you normally would.\nOkay, so let's talk\nabout willpower and heat\nand how heat shuts you down.\nIn other words, if you are cool,\nif your body temperature\nis in a particular range,\nnot only can you go further,\nbut you will go further if you want to.\nSaid differently, if you heat up too much,\nyou will stop or you will die.\nTypically people stop, there\nare individuals who will push\nto the point where they black out and die,\nin the same way that, and\nplease don't do this experiment,\nthere are people who can\nsit down face to face\nand say, let's hold our breath\nand whoever breathes first loses.\nSome people will just\ngo until it's painful\nand then they'll gasp\nand take a big breath.\nThere are always those individuals\nwho can override that reflex\nand they will go until\nthey pass out, okay?\nAnd if you do that in water,\nyou can very easily die,\nso please don't do that experiment.\nBut there's a reflex that\nrelates the body to the brain\nand the brain to the body\nthat shuts off our effort\nwhen we get too hot.\nSo what Craig and his colleagues\nand now others have done\nis to do a test in the laboratory\nwhere rather than ask\npeople to run outside\nuntil they absolutely\ndon't want to run anymore,\nyou put them on a treadmill\nand you set the speed, okay?\nSo they have to keep up with the treadmill\nand at some point they quit.\nAnd you take groups and you do those\nin different temperature environments.\nSo some people are running\nin a nice chilly laboratory,\nthey get their heart rate up.\nSo maybe their heart rate goes from,\nyou know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate,\nmaybe it gets up to 80 or a hundred\nand then they keep the rate of\nthe treadmill going the same\nand they'll just plateau.\nSo they're getting into a\nsteady state cadence or rhythm\nand their heart is beating it\nmore or less a steady state.\nEventually they'll probably stop\n'cause they have something else to do\nbut people will continue\nat that temperature\nand at that heart rate,\nunless you start turning up\nthe temperature in the room\nand at some point they will stop\nand they'll stop much\nearlier when it gets hot\nbecause of something\ncalled cardiac drift, okay?\nSo let's say I'm running\nand I'm running at a steady\ncadence on this treadmill\nand my heart rate is 85 beats per minute\nor a hundred beats per\nminute, doesn't matter,\nlet's say a hundred just\nfor sake of example.\nWell, just making the room hotter\nis going to increase\nmy heart rate further,\neven though I'm at the same output\nand the brain does a computation,\nit somehow figures out that\nthere's a heat component\nthat's increasing heart rate\nand there's an effort\ncomponent from running\nthat's driving heart rate.\nAnd if the heat component\nand the heart rate output\nfrom the effort, get to hit\na certain threshold, I stop.\nOkay, ad some of you may think,\nwell there are people who just run\nand run and run and never stop,\neventually everyone stops.\nMaybe it's because of the race ended,\nmaybe it's because, you\nknow, everyone else quit.\nI actually saw some stuff online,\nthere are these races where people\njust will continuously do the same loop\nuntil everyone else drops out\nand then one guy or girl\nkeeps going past everybody.\nBut typically it stops\nbecause the race is over\nor because people quit.\nIncreasing temperature\nincreases the rate of quitting\nin part, not entirely, but in part\nbecause of this thing called cardiac drift\nwhich you've probably experienced\nif you've been out on a hot\nday and you're walking uphill\nyou might stop to take a breath.\nIf you sit in a sauna, your\nheart rate will increase.\nHeat increases heart rate,\neffort increases heart rate.\nAt a steady effort, you'll\nhave a steady heart rate.\nIf you increase the\nheat in the environment\nthat you're engaging in\nthat steady heart rate,\nyour heart rate will now\ngo up due to cardiac drift\nand you will quit, okay?\nSo Heller and colleagues\nhave done experiments\nwhere they do palmer cooling\nunder these environments.\nAnd that's wonderful because\nnot only does it enable people\nto go further and faster for much longer\nthat's been shown statistically\nsignificant every time\nbut it also protects the brain and body\nagainst hyperthermia,\noverheating, coma, nerve injury,\nnerve death, and actual death, okay?\nSo you can see why this\nis such a valuable tool.\nSo what are they doing?\nWell, in this case too they're\nhaving them cool their hands\nand they're cooling the palms.\nCooling the bottoms of the\nfeet is a little trickier\nbut cooling the face could\nactually work as well.\nAnd we're going to talk\nabout cooling the face\nand how to incorporate this.\nSo at this point, I've just really wanted\nto impress upon you not impress\nyou, but impress upon you\nthe fact that you have these\nthree surfaces of your body\nthat are very good at\npassing cold into the body,\nsuch that it cools the\ncore body temperature\nand that's a good thing\nfor health and safety\nand in order to maintain work output\nover longer periods of time,\nor actually just do more work.\nI mean to me the result\nis just so staggering\nis the hundred to 180\npull-ups in the controls\nand then 600 pull-ups in the\ncooled individuals, right?\nThey actually also feel mentally\nas if they can do more work.\nIt's not just that they can,\ntheir willpower is adjusted somehow\nby these shifts in temperature.\nNow, before we continue\nand get to the exact ways\nthat any number of us can\nstart to use this information,\nI want to talk about the\nopposite thing, which is heating.\nAnd you have to remember\nthat these surfaces,\nthe palms and the bottoms\nof the feet and the face\nwill not just a range with these AVAs,\nthese special ways to pass\nblood from arteries to veins\nin order to cool us for\nbetter athletic performance\nor to heat us for on cold days\nbut for both of those things.\nNow Heller and colleagues\nand others have also explored\nhow these can be used to heat up the core.\nThere are times when we\nwant to heat up our core.\nTypically we hear that most of the heat\nescapes through our heads,\nso we'll put on a hat when we go outside,\nthat's actually not true.\nMost of your heat escapes\nthrough your face,\nthe palms of your hands and\nthe bottoms of your feet.\nNow you should know why that's the case.\nWhat this means is that\nfor post-surgery patients\nor for people that are hypothermic,\nindeed you want to heat the core, right?\nBut actually I was on a swim recently\nwhere a friend became hypothermic.\nHe was kind of slurring his words\nand kind of staggering around\nwhen we got him back on the beach,\nwe brought him over to\nthe lifeguard station,\nhe turned out to be fine.\nAgain, this is why cold water swims\nare something that you\nreally need to do in groups,\nnot alone and you really have\nto know what you're doing.\nThere were reasons for why\nthis happened that day,\nbut, you know we were basically\npeople thought we were a little strange\nuntil they realized what was happening.\nWe were walking down the beach\nbasically sandwiching him\nbetween at our chest\nbecause we were still warmer\nthan the ambient environment,\nthe environment around us.\nAnd we were pushing our chest against him\nto try and warm him up\nto warm up his core.\nIn retrospect, that was\nthe wrong thing to do.\nIn talking with Craig and\ntalking to other colleagues\nthat work on thermogenesis.\nWhat we should have done was warm,\nhit the palms of his hands,\nthe bottoms of his feet\nand his face because that\nwould insulate the heat loss.\nNow he was very cold\nso presumably there was vasoconstriction\nof the veins at these locations.\nAnd so it's not clear\nthat that would have been\nthe only strategy to use\nbut they have explored how to\nheat up post-surgery patients\nand one of the best ways to do that\nis to get warm socks on\nthe bottoms of the feet,\nget gloves on the hands\nand if it can be done\nsafely to warm the face.\nNow, of course you don't\nwant to obstruct respiration\nand things of that sort.\nBut again the ability to\npass heat into the body\nor to remove heat to the body\nis best done through these three surfaces.\nI can't emphasize that enough.\nSo I mentioned before that\nyou want to cool the palms\nor the bottoms of the feet\nalthough that's a little\nharder to do or the face\nbut not so much that the\nblood vessels constrict\nbecause then you won't be able\nto pass cool into the body\nbecause those pipes got smaller\nand therefore you can't\npass cool into the body.\nSo how can you start to incorporate this?\nWell, Craig and colleagues have a company\nthat they've spun out through Stanford.\nWe'll talk about that when\nwe sit down with Craig\nthat has made engineered devices\nthat are optimal for this\nthat are going to keep\nthose passages open,\nkeep the size of the, those\nveins correct to pass cool\ninto the body quickly for sake\nof elite sports performance\nand even recreational sports performance\nbut you can actually\nstart to incorporate this.\nFirst of all, I always get asked\nhow cold should the water be?\nShould it be ice water?\nShould it be very cold water?\nThe answer is no.\nIf you want to experience\nsome of this effect\nwithout a device, one thing you could do\nwould be for instance to do, I dunno,\nI'll use the, the, the gym or\nthe treadmill as an example.\nYou could do your maximum\nnumber of pull-ups, stop\nand then you could actually\nput your hands into\nor on the surface of a sink\nthat is presumably stopped up\nwith cool water.\nSo not ice water, not\nfreezing cold, but cool water,\nslightly cooler than body temperature\nbefore you started training\nwould be a good place to start.\nYou do that for 10 to 30 seconds.\nThen you could go back\nand do your next set.\nYou would repeat the cooling,\nyou would want to extend the\namount of cooling somewhat\nso you might want to do that\nfor 30 seconds to a minute.\nThis is not going to be perfect,\nyou're going to have to play\nwith how cold to make it\nin order to get the optimal effect\nbut you ought to see\nan effect nonetheless.\nThe same is true if you're\nrunning and you're fatiguing,\nobviously you don't want\nto become hyperthermic,\ncooling the hands or the\nbottoms of your feet or the face\nwould be the ideal way to dump heat\nin order to be able to\ngenerate more output.\nNow, the face is something\nthat we haven't talked a lot about.\nEverything I've told you\nup until now also says\nthat if you are somebody\nwho tends to get cold\nwhen you are outside, say in\nthe winter or even in the fall,\nyou tend to run cold, warming your face\nis going to be the most important thing\nthat you can do.\nNow, it's kind of hard to do\nthat without looking strange\nlike wearing a ski mask\nor something like that\nbut that is going to be more effective\nthan covering and warming\nany other part of your body\nalthough it'd be quite strange\nif you only had a ski mask on\nand you weren't wearing clothes\nanywhere else on your body,\nI don't recommend doing that outside,\nthat will get you into all\nsorts of other kinds of trouble.\nThat wouldn't be good for anybody.\nBut now you understand the\nprinciple and the locations\nat which to deliver heat and cold.\nSo let's say that you are out for a run\nand you want to incorporate\nthis cooling mechanism,\nI talked to Craig about this,\nI said, what would be the\nkind of poor person's approach\nto this before this devices\ncommercially available?\nAnd he said, well, you, you\ncould take a frozen juice can,\nif you have one of those\nor a very cold can of soda\nand you would want to\npass it back and forth\nbetween your two hands.\nThe reason the passing back\nand forth is really important\nis because you, again you\ndon't want it to be so cold\nthat you constrict those veins portals\nthat it will allow cold\nto go into the body.\nNow, there are certainly people\nthat are working on bike handles,\nand that can actually cool the hands.\nYou can expect with\nthe Olympics coming up,\npeople are aware of these data\nand are starting to incorporate\nit into a number of things.\nHere's what you don't want to\ndo and there are sports teams\nthat I won't mention by name or brand\nthat have made this mistake\nand it costs them dearly.\nYou don't want to cool the core\nif you want to cool the body, right?\nIf it's very hot day and\nyou're going to train,\ngetting into an ice bath first,\nsure it will cool you down,\nbut it's not going to be as\neffective as cooling the palms,\nthe bottoms of the feet and the face.\nI have a friend who does some\nimportant work in this space\nwith people in various,\nlet's just say cultures\nwhere heat is generated quite a lot\nand they need to dump heat,\nice packs delivered to the face\nare something that they actually use\nin order to dump heat quickly.\nNow, again, you don't want\nto keep the ice pack on your face.\nThese are people that are\nvery high work output, right?\nFirefighters and similar,\nat very high work output\nand then they'll put this essentially,\nit's like a cool face mask on their face.\nIt allow their core body\ntemperature come down\nand then they remove it,\nthey're not keeping it on there so long\nthat they're getting the\nvasoconstriction, okay?\nSo there are a number of\nways that you could do this.\nAnd again, I'm not giving\nspecific temperatures\nbecause it depends on how hot that day\nand how hot your body temperature is.\nSo you can see why there's a\nneed to create more devices\nfor this, but you can see\na considerable improvement\nin endurance, in strength\nand in all kinds of explosive\nand sort of, you know,\nexplosive power type output\nin athletics by using\nthese surfaces of the hands\nand bottoms of the feet and face.\nThe one that I've tried\nbecause in anticipation of\nthis episode was the dips\nwhere then I would cool my hands,\nI actually decided to cool the\nbottoms of my feet as well,\nbecause it just feels good\nand it's particularly hot out lately,\nso no shoes or socks on,\nput my feet into the bottoms of my feet\njust kind of hovering\nabout a centimeter or two\nbelow the surface of a bucket of water\nthat was just slightly, it felt cool,\nslightly cooler than\nbody temperature or so.\nIt just basically what\ncame out of the spigot\nafter I let it run for a little bit.\nAnd indeed I saw a 60% increase\nin the number of dips I\ncan do in a single session.\nSo it's actually a\nquite significant effect\nand you don't have to be perfectly precise\nin order to do it.\nAnd of course, if you want to\nheat up for whatever reason,\nlike you're camping or you're\nlost in the environment,\nremember these three surfaces\nare going to be the best\nway to heat your as well.\nSo up until now, we've been\ntalking about how to use cold\nduring a workout in order\nto improve performance\nand indeed cold applied\nto the appropriate parts of\nthe body, the appropriate times\ncan vastly improve our performance\nand endurance and strength.\nNow, I want to talk about\nthe use of temperature\nin particular cold to improve the speed\nand the depth of recovery.\nRecovery is obviously vital, right?\nDuring a weight training session\nor during an endurance session,\nthat's just the stimulus for\ngetting better the next time\nand if you don't recover, you\nnot only won't get better,\nbut you'll get worse.\nThere's a lot of interest\nin the use of cold\nin order to improve\nrecovery in the short term.\nWe see this and probably\nthe best example of this\nwould be fighters in combat sports\nbetween rounds or athletes during\nin between quarters or halftime,\nthat's one form of recovery.\nThe ability to go back\ninto the sport very soon\non an order of minutes,\nanywhere from like one minute\nin between rounds and\ntypical combat sports\nor several minutes and\na half time, et cetera.\nTypically what we see is\npeople cooling their core,\ncooling the back of their neck,\ncooling the top of their heads.\nSo it might be, you know,\na sponge with cold water\nover the top of the head\nor an ice pack on the back of the neck,\nor in some cases even\nwearing cold ice vests,\nthat's actually been done.\nThat's going to be a very inefficient way\nto improve recovery of that kind.\nFar better would be to cool the face,\nthe palms of the hands\nor the bottoms the feet\nfor the reasons that I\ndescribed up until now.\nSubmerging the body in an ice\nbath, or taking a cold shower,\nsay up to the neck or up to the chest\nor getting under cold water\nor jumping in a cold lake\nor something of that sort,\nor in the locker room,\ngetting under the cold shower\nalso would be a terrible way\nto cool off the body quickly\ncompared to the ways that I described\nthrough the palms of the\nhands, the bottoms of the feet\nor the face for the following reason.\nFirst of all, it's not optimizing\nthose portals of the face,\npalms the hands and the feet\nand in addition, if it's\nvery cold and you submerge\nor you cover a lot of\nthe body with that cold,\nyou're going to cause constriction\nof the very vessels and pathways\nthat allow the body to\nefficiently dump heat.\nSo again, the key thing\nis to cool these one\nor two or three of these surfaces\nbut not so cold that you\ncause the vasoconstriction.\nSo what does this mean for you?\nIt means that getting in an\nice bath or a cold shower\nor putting an ice pack\non the back of your neck\nin most cases is not going to be as good\nas splashing cold water on your face\nor even just holding your\nface in a damp cool cloth\nor something of that sort.\nIt seems kind of counterintuitive,\nyou think, oh if I just\njump into an ice bath,\nI'm going to cool down much faster\nthan if I just cooled these,\nyou know one or two or three\nof these select regions of the body\nbut that's actually not the case.\nAnd then of course\nthere's recovery that occurs\nfrom session to session.\nSo outside of the game or the\nmatch or the exercise session\nand many people are now relying\non things like cryotherapy\nwhich requires a lot\nof expensive equipment,\nbig, you know liquid\nnitrogen driven machine.\nThose aren't so common for most people\nor accessible for most\npeople, but a lot of people\nare using cold baths or\nice baths or cold showers.\nAnd again, that's not\ngoing to optimize recovery.\nIn fact, it's going to\nhave an additional effect\nthat is going to potentially\nblock the training stimulus.\nWhen you get into an ice\nbath indeed, there are,\nprovided it's not very, very cold,\nif you get into a cold shower,\nprovided is not very, very cold,\nyou are indeed blocking\nsome of the inflammation\nthat occurs because of\nthe training session.\nBut in doing so you also\nare blocking pathways,\nsuch as mTOR, mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin,\nwhich are involved in the adaptation\nfor a muscle to become stronger or bigger.\nPut simply, covering the body in cold\nor immersing the body\nin cold after training\ncan short circuit or\nprevent the hypertrophy\nor muscle growth response.\nIt has other effects that\ncan be positive, right?\nIt can induce thermogenesis, et cetera,\nit can reduce inflammation\nbut it can prevent some of the\npositive effects of exercise.\nNow, it hasn't been examined\nso much for endurance work\nbut let's say you come back\nfrom around of endurance work\nor run or a bike or a swim,\ngetting into a cool bath\nor cooling the palms, the\nbottoms of the feet or the face,\nin my opinion, based on\nthe science would be better\nthan completely immersing\nthe body in the ice bath\nor the cold shower.\nThere is a time and a place\nfor the use of the ice\nbath or the cold shower\nor the cold plunge, those tend to be\nwhen you want to deliberately\nincrease brown fat thermogenesis\nor when you want to deliberately\nwork on mental resilience.\nAnd in a subsequent episode on fat loss\nI'm going to talk about how\nto optimize the use of cold\nspecifically for increasing\nmetabolism and fat loss.\nBut for now, since we're\ntalking about the use of cold\nfor improving performance and recovery,\nthe suggestion that I'm going\nto provide is based on the work\nof Craig Heller and colleagues\nthat I've been talking about\nas well as a excellent book\nI mainly rely on textbooks\nand special volume books which\nare collections of papers\nfrom experts in a particular area\nthat go beyond standard kind\nof college level textbooks.\nThe one that I've been relying on\nis called \"Thermoregulation\nin Human Performance,\nPhysiological and Biological\nAspects\" by Effie Marino.\nI don't know the publisher,\nI don't know the author.\nI do recognize some of the names\nof the particular papers there,\nbut I just want to be clear\nthere's no sort of business\nrelationship or deal with them\nbut it's an excellent text,\nit's called \"Thermoregulation\nin Human Performance\".\nYou can find it online\nif you want to go really deep into this\nbut basically what they show is that\nif you can cool the body back\nto its resting temperature,\nfor and by resting temperature, I mean\nwithin the range that you would see\nat any time of waking\nday, but not in exercise.\nSo just bringing that the body\ntemperature down to baseline.\nIf you can do that,\nthe sooner you can do\nthat after a workout,\nthe sooner that the muscle will recover,\nthat the tendons will recover\nand that the person you\ncan get back into more endurance training,\nmore weight training, et cetera.\nSo cold actually can be a very\npowerful tool for recovery\nbut to maximize return to\nbaseline levels of temperature,\nit's my belief based on the studies\nthat are published in this book\nas well as my discussions with\nmy colleague, Craig Heller\nand in reviewing the literature overall\nthat just simply cooling the entire body\nby jumping into an ice\nbath or a cold shower\nis not the best way to go.\nYou really want to rely\non one of these three\nglaborous skin portals of the palms,\nthe bottoms of the feet or the face.\nSo now you probably know more\nthan you ever wanted to know\nabout how we regulate body temperature\nand how it can be applied to exercise\nboth during the exercise session\nand afterward to optimize recovery.\nMany of us, all of us, presumably\nare also eating and drinking\nthings and taking things\nat various times that\ncan impact this process.\nAnd so, because of that, we should ask\nwhether or not those things\nare impacting body temperature.\nAnd when we do that, we find\nthat there are certain things\nthat many of us are doing\nthat are actually\nimpairing our performance.\nSo for instance, if you are\ntaking a pre-workout drink\nor you're ingesting a lot of\ncaffeine or other substance\nto bring your body temperature\nup before exercise,\nyou are limiting the amount\nof exercise that you can do.\nI can recall a time in college\nwhen I would drink a lot of espresso\nback then ephedrine was\nsold over the counter,\nI remember taking it,\nit will really energize you for workouts.\nYou can generate a lot of energy\nand get extremely focused\ntaking those things.\nThey do increase heart rate,\nthey can be quite dangerous,\nI don't recommend people take them.\nIn fact, I think ephedrine\nis now off the shelves\nas a non prescription compound\nbecause various people died from taking it\nwho were sensitive to\nit or exercised in heat.\nBut looking back at that,\nI realized it was a foolish approach.\nIt was increasing core thermogenesis.\nSure I might've burned a few more calories\nbut actually when I look at the data\nthat are coming from specific cooling\nand how that can so\nincrease in performance\nif done properly and then I\ncompare that to the effects\nof taking some sort of thermogenic\ncompound, whatever it is\nsome pre-workout or some pill\nor high levels of caffeine,\nit's very clear that\nincreasing body temperature\nprior to working out is\nthe exact wrong thing\nthat one would want to do.\nYou don't want to stay so cold\nthat you can't generate\ngood muscle contractions.\nYou don't want to be like I am\ncoming out of the cold ocean,\nyou know, with claws for hands\nbut one wants to have your\nbody temperature in a range\nthat still allows you to\nwork hard and perform well.\nNow, in terms of recovery,\nthings like alcohol,\nwe know our vasodilator.\nSo those are going to cause\npeople to drop body temperature.\nSo you might think, oh, well\nthat sounds great for recovery\nand I don't think people\nshould be drinking who are\nyou know, have problems\nwith alcohol intake,\nyou know, alcoholics\nor they're not of drinking age, et cetera.\nI'm not a drinker, but\nI do have a good friend\nwho's a quite accomplished athlete\nwho basically drinks a beer or two\nafter his long runs or cycling\nand you know, his argument\nis well, I'm dumping body\nheat and I like a beer\nand he's probably right, it's\nprobably a really good tool\nprovided you don't have\nissues with alcohol\nthat would preclude that as a tool\nor you're not of drinking age.\nBut anything that you\ningest after exercise\nthat would increase body temperature\nis going to impede recovery.\nAnything that you do that\nlowers body temperature\nprovides it's in safe ranges\nis going to accelerate recovery.\nAnd that brings us to the\nwhole host of compounds\nthat people take that can\nincrease body temperature.\nAnd many people are taking these things\nin order to increase fat\nburning and increase metabolism\nbut in my opinion\nit's impeding their\nability to perform well.\nAnd especially if the performance\nis something that you're focused on\naside from body recomposition,\nlosing fat building muscle.\nBut even if you're focused on\nlosing fat, building muscle\nyou have to ask yourself, is\nthe body temperature increase\nthat I'm getting from these\ncompounds really worth it\ngiven that it can block\nor prevent my performance\nfrom being as good as it could?\nIn other words, is it\nworth taking something\nthat makes you feel very\nenergized to go work out\nbut then you now know that\nyou are stopping earlier\nand you're performing\nless well, fewer reps,\nfewer steps overall, is it worth it?\nIf you had not taken that thing\nthen you could perform much longer\nand at much higher capacity.\nSome of you are probably\nsaying, well, that's ridiculous\nbecause when I drink a quadruple espresso\nand I pop a whatever pre-workout\nor drink a pre-workout\nthen I know I can go much further.\nAh, that might be true but\nthe increase in temperature\nis also costing you on the recovery side.\nAnd unless you're doing other things\nto improve your recovery and\nI know many people that are,\nI don't judge but many people\nwho are doing those things\nare also augmenting their recovery\nthrough hormone augmentation\nand other performance enhancing tools,\nthen for the typical\nperson who's not doing that\nit's probably shooting\nyourself in the foot.\nSo let's take a look at what\nsome of those compounds are\nand what they and just briefly review\nwhether or not they would be a\ngood or a bad idea to include\nif your main goals are performance\nor your main goals are\nbody recomposition or both.\nSo let's just briefly discuss stimulants.\nThis could be caffeine,\nthis could be any other kind of stimulant\nthat are typically in a pre-workout drink\nor anything that might get you\nrevved up before exercising.\nThis could even be very strong tea,\nI've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.\nI like a yerba mate, I love that stuff\nand I also drink caffeine.\nI drink love coffee of various kinds\nmushroom coffee, black\ncoffee, espresso, et cetera.\nI'm a chronic caffeine user,\nI don't think I'm an addict\nbut I'm a chronic caffeine user.\nMeaning when I drink caffeine\nmy heart rate doesn't increase so much\nthat it feels like a shock to my system.\nSome people are not caffeine adapted\nor they're very caffeine sensitive.\nHere's the straightforward rule.\nCaffeine for somebody who\ndoesn't drink caffeine very much\nwill constrict the blood vessels\nand will increase retention of body heat\nand it's probably a bad\nidea before exercise.\nFor somebody who's caffeine adapted\nand is used to drinking caffeine,\nit won't have that\nvasoconstriction effect,\nthat's what the data point\ntoo, because I'm adapted to it\nbut it will cause vasodilation\nand will allow me to dump body heat.\nSo for me, I use it before I train\nor do any kind of exercise\nbecause I tend to do\nthat early in the day,\nit won't prevent me from sleeping\nand it causes vasodilation.\nAnd then afterwards I'm aware\nthat it causes vasoconstriction\nafter the caffeine wears off.\nSo for somebody who drinks two or three\nor more cups of coffee\na day or mate a day,\nso we're talking intake\nof anywhere from a hundred to\n400 milligrams of caffeine,\nwhat you want to do is\nyou want to make sure\nthat you would do that before exercise\nand probably not after exercise,\nnot just makes logical sense\ngiven what we know about\nthermal regulation.\nAnd if you're somebody who\ndoesn't drink caffeine,\ndrinking caffeine before a workout\nis going to be about the worst thing\nthat you could possibly do\nbecause it's going to\nincrease core body temperature\nthrough its thermogenic effects\nand it's going to constrict\nyour blood vessels\nand make it even harder to dump heat.\nSo I don't suggest that\npeople drink caffeine or not,\nI just suggest that you think about\nwhether or not your\ncaffeine adapted or not,\nand decide whether or not\nyou want to drink caffeine.\nIn general, you're going to be\nbetter not drinking any caffeine\nthan you are drinking caffeine\nunless you're a heavy\ncaffeine user or abuser.\nIn which case not drinking caffeine\nis going to give you vicious headaches\nand is going to make it\nvery hard to get motivated\nbecause you're just not used to it.\nIt takes about three weeks\nto get used to no caffeine.\nIt's brutal, I've done it\nbefore, I've done caffeine fast,\nI don't know that I ever\nwant to do it again,\nthat's how painful it was.\nBut you get headaches\nbecause of the effects on\nvasodilation and constriction.\nIf you like caffeine\nuse in moderate amounts\nand use it before your not after.\nIf you don't like caffeine or\nyou don't use it very often,\nstay away from it\nanywhere close to exercise\nbefore or after for that matter.\nOne of the more commonly used compounds\nthat's sold over the counter\nare non-steroid anti-inflammatories\nso things like Tylenol and\nAdvil and other trade names\nand Neproxin sodium things of that sort,\nalmost all of those drop body\ntemperature to some extent.\nAnd that's why it's often recommended\nthat people take them\nwhen they have a fever\nalthough the whole business\nof dropping body temperature artificially\nwhen you have a fever is itself\nan interesting discussion\nwhether or not that's the most\nadaptive or best thing to do\ncertainly you don't want\nfever to go too high,\ncan be very dangerous, can kill you\nbut artificially dropping body temperature\nwith these compounds can be tricky.\nNow, a number of athletes\nespecially endurance athletes\nwill rely on these non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs\nspecifically to keep\nbody temperature lower\nduring long bouts of exertion.\nThis is a little bit of\na pharmacologic version\nof dumping heat instead\nof using palmer cooling\nor you know, face ice pack cooling,\nthey're relying on pharmacology\nto drop their core body temperature.\nThat has certain obvious advantages,\nthose advantages should be obvious\nand the reasons for them should be obvious\nbased on everything we've\ntalked about up until now\nlower temperature allows\nyou to go further harder\nwith more intensity.\nHowever, they do have effects on the liver\nand they can also have\neffects on the kidneys\nand during long bouts of exercise\nor even short bouts of exercise,\nwater balance and salt balance\nare also going to be vital\nto maintain in order to perform well,\ngenerate the best muscle\ncontraction, stay mentally alert\nand also to stay alive.\nWe will do an episode on\nsalt electrolytes and water\nand water balance but you\nprobably want to think carefully\nabout whether or not\nyou want to use non-steroid\nanti-inflammatories\nbefore any training session\njust for the performance\naugmentation effect\nunless you're working\ncarefully with a coach\nwhether or not you've\ndone that in practices\nand of course, whether or\nnot you are in a situation\nwhere monitoring your\nbody temperature carefully\nis going to be important.\nYou might ask, well, when would that be?\nWell, desert races, summer\ntraining and races, winter rides,\nyou certainly don't want\nto get too cool either.\nSo alcohol, caffeine and\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\nbecause of their effects on temperature\nwill impact performance and recovery\nbut you want to be cautious\nabout how you approach them.\nI personally am more a\nfan of using caffeine\nin moderate doses for the\nreasons I described before\nas well to use the cooling of the palms,\ncooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,\nby placing them into a\nbucket or into a cool bath\nafter training or cooling\nthe face after training\nor sometimes even during training.\nIt just seems like\nthere's more of a margin\nto play with the variables,\nto heat up the water\nor cool it down a little\nbit to include one palm\nor the other palm.\nThere's all sorts of good parameter space\nas we call it in science\nthat you can play with\nand work with to find what works for you\nwhereas when you pop a pill,\nsure you can adjust the dose\nand you can adjust it next time\nbut once it's in you, it's in you\nand there's going to\nbe some period of time\nbefore you can modulate it.\nWhat I've offered today\nare ways in which you can use temperature\nto powerfully improve performance.\nAnd if you think about it,\nyou can vary that from set to set,\nyou could do your pull ups or your sprints\nand then cool your palms,\nand then try and go with\ncolder water the next round\nor warmer water the next round\nor do both feet and palms and face.\nI mean, you can do all sorts\nof things moment to moment\nand see what works for you again\nessentially zero cost or no cost.\nWhereas when you pop\nsomething, you take a pill,\nyou're basically in that regimen\nfor the next hour or two or more.\nYou can always take more, but\nyou can't really take less.\nYou can't really extract it\nfrom your body in real time\nso it doesn't give you\na lot of opportunity\nto play scientists, which\nis what I like to do\nbecause what I'm always trying to do\nis trying to dial in the\nbest protocols possible\nbased on the mechanisms and data.\nAnd if you can do that moment to moment\nthat places you in a position of power.\nOnce again, we covered a lot of material.\nBy now, after seeing this episode\nor listening to this episode,\nyou should understand a lot\nabout how your body heats and cools itself\nand the value of that\nfor physical performance.\nI hope you'll also appreciate\nthat you have tools at your disposal\nto vastly improve your\nphysical performance.\nAnd should you try those,\nplease let us know how it goes.\nIf you decide to do palmer\ncooling during your runs\nor after your runs, during\nyour weight workouts,\nduring your yoga sessions,\nwhatever it is, let us know,\nplease place that in the comments.\nI've given you specific\nprotocols and some direction,\nbut I've also left it slightly vague\nbecause it, as I mentioned earlier\nI don't know all the\nenvironmental conditions,\nI don't know how hot your yoga studio is\nor how cool your gym happens to be\nor your body temperature or time of day.\nRemember your temperature will vary\naccording to the time of day,\nwe did a whole episode\nabout that related to sleep.\nTypically your body temperature\nis rising early in the day\nand is coming down as you\napproach the late evening\nand late night hours for sleep,\nin the middle of the night\nyour temperature is very low\nat its absolute lowest\nsomething we call the temperature minimum.\nSo we don't know exactly where you're at.\nYou need to take the information\nthat you receive today\nand should you try and incorporate it\ntry and do it intelligently.\nDon't cool yourself off\nso much that you know\nbecome cryogenic and please\ndon't warm yourself up.\nIn fact, we didn't talk at\nall about warming yourself up\nbecause warming yourself up too\nmuch can be quite dangerous.\nYou never, ever, ever\nwant to be hypothermic,\nthat's what your body and your\nbrain are trying to avoid.\nWe talked a little bit about supplements\nbut not the standard sorts of supplements\nI usually list off on these episodes.\nRather, we talked about caffeine,\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatories\nand how those can impact temperature,\nhow alcohol can impact temperature.\nAnd I should just mention in closing\nthat every time we eat, we\nalso increased temperature.\nThere's a eating induced\nthermogenic effect\nbut that's a minor one,\nthat's a small one.\nSo you wouldn't worry about\neating before training\nbecause of its effects on temperature\nbecause it tends to be really minor.\nGoing forward, we're going to\ntalk more about temperature\nand other ways to improve\nphysical performance\nand skill learning.\nWe're going to talk about specific ways\nto accelerate fat loss,\nto improve muscle growth,\nto improve suppleness and flexibility.\nThese approaches and\nmechanisms are anchored deeply\nin neuroscience and physiology\nand the relationship\nbetween our peripheral\norgans, which include our skin\nand our brain and all\nthe organs in between.\nSo it's really a pleasure for\nme because I'm able to look\nto the textbook literature that exists\nand really came out over the\nlast 50 to a hundred years\nand unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience\nwhich are still sort of mystical,\nlike consciousness and dreaming,\nof which we understand a little bit\nabout these core mechanisms\nof temperature and physiology\nwhich are so powerful,\ninvolve very concrete studies\nthat as you learn today\nare very actionable.\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\nand you like the information\nthat
