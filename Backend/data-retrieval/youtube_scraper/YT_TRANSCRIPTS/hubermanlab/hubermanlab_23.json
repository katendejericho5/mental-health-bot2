    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the hubman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine today's episode marks the\nfourth in our sixth episode series all\nabout sleep with expert guest Dr Matthew\nWalker during today's episode we discuss\nsleep and learning as well as the impact\nof sleep and the specific stages of\nsleep on creativity and memory we talk\nabout when and how long to sleep\nrelative to different bouts of learning\nas well as the role of naps in\nconsolidating information that you are\ntrying to learn we discuss the science\nand Protocols of sleep as it relates to\nboth cognitive learning and motor\nlearning and the mechanism by which\nsleep encodes memories as with the\nprevious episodes in this series today's\nepisode includes information about the\nbiology of sleep as well as practical\ntools that is protocols in which you can\nuse sleep to improve your learning\nmemory and creativity before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nHelix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that are customized to your\nunique sleep needs it's abundantly clear\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwhen we're getting enough quality sleep\neverything in life goes so much better\nand when we are not getting enough\nquality sleep everything in life is that\nmuch more challenging now one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis to have the appropriate mattress\neveryone however has slightly different\nneeds in terms of what would be the\noptimal mattress for them Helix\nunderstands that people have unique\nsleep needs and they've designed a brief\ntwo-minute quiz that asks you questions\nlike do you sleep on your back your side\nor your stomach do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night or maybe you\ndon't know the answers to those\nquestions if you go to the Helix site\nand take that brief quiz they'll match\nyou to a mattress that's optimal for you\nfor me it turned out to be the dusk DS\nmattress it's not too hard not too soft\nand I sleep so much better on my Helix\nmattress than on any other type of\nmattress I've used before so if you're\ninterested in upgrading your mattress go\nto helixsleep.com\nhuberman take their brief two-minute\nsleep quiz and they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you and you'll\nget up to $350 off any mattress order\nand two free pillows again that's\nhelixsleep.com\nhuberman to save up to $350 off and two\nfree pillows today today episode is also\nbrought To Us by whooop whoop is a\nfitness wearable device that tracks your\ndaily activity and sleep but also goes\nbeyond that by providing real-time\nfeedback on how to adjust your training\nand sleep schedule to perform better\nI've been working with whoop on their\nscientific advisory Council to try and\nhelp Advance wop's mission of unlocking\nHuman Performance as a whoop user I've\nexperienced the health benefits of their\ntechnology firsthand for sleep tracking\nfor monitoring other features of my\nphysiology and for giving me a lot of\nfeedback about metrics within my brain\nand body body that tell me how hard I\nshould train or not train and basically\npoint to the things that I'm doing\ncorrectly and incorrectly in my daily\nlife that I can adjust using protocols\nsome of which are actually within the\nwhoop app given that many of us have\ngoals such as improving our sleep\nbuilding better habits or just focusing\nmore on our overall health whoop is one\nof the tools that can really help you\nget personalized data recommendations\nand coaching toward your overall health\nin addition to being one of the most\naccurate sleep trackers in the world\nwhoop allows you to recover more quickly\nand fully from physical exercise and\nother kinds of stress and thereby to\ntrain more effectively and sleep better\nif you're interested in trying whoop you\ncan go to join. whoop.com huberman today\nto get your first month free again\nthat's join. woop.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by waking up the waking up app is\na meditation app that offers hundreds of\nguided meditations mindfulness trainings\nyoga need your sessions and more I\nstarted meditating over 30 years ago at\nthat time there wasn't very much science\non meditation\nbut by now we know that there's a lot of\nstrong science supporting the fact that\na daily meditation practice can improve\nmood focus and alertness and can reduce\nstress and improve sleep and overall\nhealth one thing that I and many others\nhave noticed is that while meditation is\nexcellent for buffering stress it's\noften times during periods of stress\nthat we let our meditation practice go\nthe waking up app overcomes this by\noffering meditations of different\ndurations so they have some longer ones\nof 30 to 60 minutes but also some much\nbriefer ones 10 five and even one minute\nmeditations that are known to be\neffective so no matter how busy or\nstress you get you always make time for\nyour meditation practice the fact that\nthey have lots of different types of\nmeditations and Yoga Nidra sessions and\nnon-sleep deep rest protocols also make\nsure that your meditations are kept\nfresh and interesting you never get\nbored of them I personally use the\nwaking up app to do a 5 to 10 minute\nmeditation or a non-sleep deep rest\nprotocol which is similar to Yoga Nidra\neach and every day and if I miss a day I\ntry and double up the amount of time\nthat I do nsdr Yoga Nidra or medit the\nfollowing day yoga NRA and non-sleep\ndeep rest protocols can be done\nessentially any time of day in order to\nrestore mental and physical Vigor I'll\nsometimes do one first thing in the\nmorning if I wake up and I feel I didn't\nget quite enough sleep the previous\nnight you can also do yoga NRA or nsdr\nin the middle of the night if you wake\nup and you're having trouble falling\nback asleep sometimes they will allow\nyou to fall back asleep and if they\ndon't you'll still feel more refreshed\nthan you would have had you been tossing\nand turning and worrying about not\ngetting sleep so nsdr and yoga Nedra are\nterrific for both restoring mental and\nphysical Vigor and potentially for\nrestoring sleep that you otherwise would\nhave missed if you'd like to try the\nwaking up app you can go to waking\nup.com huberman to get a free 30-day\ntrial again that's waking up.com\nhuberman and now for my conversation\nwith Dr Matthew Walker Dr Walker Dr\nhubman welcome back we have covered a\nlot of material first episode of this\nseries you gave us an overview of sleep\nand some actionable items about sleep\nthen in the second episode you gave us\nfar more actionable items of how to\nthink about one sleep in a way that\nleads to very concrete decisions about\ncontrolling light temperature when to\nsleep and then some really\nin-depth Advanced tools or protocols as\nwe call them and then in the third\nepisode we talked about caffeine and\nnapping and some other things that\npeople can do to really supercharg their\nalertness through sleep augmentation in\nthe daytime and today we're going to\ntalk about sleep learning in memory and\na topic that I know everybody is very\ninterested in creativity indeed\nresplendant pleasure to be back on the\nshow thank you for having me yeah\nabsolutely so I think nowadays most\npeople understand that there's some\nrelationship between sleep and learning\nbut I think it would still be a good\nidea for us to zoom out a bit and and\nestablish what that relationship is you\nknow I I think most people are familiar\nwith being exposed to some new material\ncognitive material physical uh skill\nmaterial and not being able to learn it\nright away but then having a few days in\nbetween and then all of a sudden voila\nyeah there's uh the skill has been\nembedded it seems but not obvious in\nthat scenario is that sleep is perhaps\nthe pivotal event that allowed the\nlearning process to take place so how do\nyou think about sleep as it relates to\nlearning and memory I think I've\nconceptualized it in three different\nstages or three different buckets of a\nbenefit the first is that we need sleep\nbefore learning to prepare your brain to\ninitially imprint and lay those memory\ntraces down but then you need to sleep\nafter learning to take those sort of\nfreshly minted memories and then save\nthem and cement them into the brain so\nthat you don't lose them the third\ndomain is that sleep will then take\nthose new memories that you've been\nlearning and it will start to collide\nthem with all of this back catalog of\ninformation that you've already got\nstored in your brain and it updates the\niOS of your informational systems so\nthat then you come back the next day and\nyou have a better abled ability to\nunderstand how the world Works in other\nwords the difference between knowledge\nwhich is learning the facts and wisdom\nwhich is knowing what it all means when\nyou put it together that's the third\ncategory and why is that beneficial\nbecause it provides you with creative\ninsights and so we will will perhaps\njust double click on each of those three\nand I can I can expand them because the\ndata behind them is utterly fascinating\nas you said I think many people\nsubjectively have a sense that sleep\nhelps me with my memory in some way but\nin what way and for people I think one\nof the things that you do here is not\njust protocols but you help explain the\nconceptual understanding or the\nconceptual mechanisms underlying the\nreasons for all of the these protocols\nand I would love to dive into detail\nyeah so let's do that let's talk about\nthis business of sleeping before\nlearning you know\nessentially establishing a millu within\nthe brain that is optimal for learning\nwhat what is that about and\nneurochemically at the level of circuits\nand um what is the evidence that\nproviding some I don't know additional\nsleep or just adequate sleep prior to\nthe exposure to the new material can be\nbeneficial yeah I that word that optimal\nmillu and it beautifully describes what\nwe found we started off asking a very\nsimple question at my sleep center is\npulling the allnighter a wise\nidea so we took a group of perfectly\nhealthy smart individuals and we\nassigned them to one of two experimental\ngroups a sleep group and a sleep\ndeprivation\ngroup and both of those groups went\nthrough those two different protocols\nand then the next next day after sleep\nor after no sleep we put them inside of\na brain scanner and we had them try and\nlearn a whole list of new facts as we\nwere taking snapshots of brain activity\nand then we tested them to see how\neffective that learning had been when we\nlooked at the group that had had a full\nnight of sleep they had incredibly\nefficient learning capacity so in other\nwords they had learned and imprinted\nthat information initially very well\nwell when we looked at the sleep\ndeprivation group not so much in fact\nthere was a 40% deficit in the ability\nof the brain to make new memories\nwithout sleep and we've used lots of\ndifferent types we've replicated that\nnow we've had visual information we've\nhad textbook like information and the\nrange is somewhere between 20 to\n40% I find that by the way striking and\nwe can come back to this based on what\nwe are seeing in our Educational Systems\nright now there is this parcity of sleep\nbecause of this model of early school\nstart times and I'll explain exactly\nwhat's happened there and what we've\nbeen doing to try to change that but\ncoming back to those two groups the\nSleep group and the sleep deprivation\ngroup what was going on as you said\ninside of the brain that would help us\nunderstand why they couldn't learn or at\nleast couldn't learn\neffectively and the structure that we\nfocused on is one you've spoken about\nbefore called the\nhippocampus and you have one on the left\nside and the right side of your brain it\nlooks like a long cigar that runs down\nthe left and right side of your brain\nand people listening can think of the\nhippocampus almost like the\ninformational inbox of your brain it's\nvery good at receiving new memory files\nand then holding on to them and when we\nlooked at that structure and its\nactivity during learning in the Sleep\ngroup they had wonderful powerful\nactivation of the hippocampus as if it\nwas gobbling up all of that new\ninformation into the inbox when we\nlooked at the sleep deprivation group\nhowever we couldn't find any significant\nsignal\nwhatsoever so it was almost as though\nsleep deprivation had shut down the\nmemory inbox and any new incoming files\nthey were just being bounced you\ncouldn't effectively commit new\nexperiences to\nmemory and then subsequent stes that\nwere not done by us but uh looking at\nanimal models they were looking at how\nable the synapses are in that memory\nstructure the hippocampus how capable\nthose synapses are for building new\nconnections and the synapses are just\nthose connections between neurons and we\nthink that part of the way that we make\nmemories is by strengthening the\nconnection in the memory circuit itself\nand what they found was that when they\nrestricted the sleep of these rats or\nthe mice that part of the brain became\nvery stubborn it just wouldn't form\nthose new synaptic connections and\nsomething that we call synaptic\nplasticity so we started to understand\nthis was the bad that happened when you\ntake sleep away but let's come back to\nthat control group that I said got a\nfull night of sleep exactly what is it\nabout sleep when you do get it that\nseems to support and promote your\nlearning\nability so we decided just do another\ndifferent study instead of manipulating\nsleep by dialing it down we instead\ntried to dial it up by way of a daytime\nnap and again we took two groups and we\nhad them initially learn again a huge\namount of factual information they\nlearned it over and over and over again\nand then we brought them back 6 hours\nlater at 6pm and now we had them learn a\nwhole new set of information and after\neach one of of those fresh novel\nlearning sessions we tested them to see\nhow effective that learning had been\nagain one of those groups spent that 6\nhours of time awake doing just relaxing\nactivities the other group was able to\nobtain a 90-minute nap and we Ed that\n90-minute nap to allow them to go\nthrough a full sort of average cycle to\nget some non-rem and to get some\nREM what was interesting is that when we\ntested the group that remained awake\nlater that fall following day the\nlearning capacity had\ndeclined but in the nap group it seemed\nto restore the brain's capacity to learn\nand you didn't get that decline in\nmemory in fact if anything you got a\nlittle boost and the difference between\nthose two was about 20% so it's quite a\nnice benefit yeah not trivial not\ntrivial at all and then we said okay\nwell if sleep is doing something what is\nit about that sleep so we unpacked the\nphysiology of sleep and the different\nstages of sleep that we discussed in the\nfirst episode and what we found was that\nit was the nonrapid eye movement sleep\nor the non-rm sleep and particularly\nthose sleep spindles those short bursts\nof electrical activity that we have\ndiscussed before that seemed to predict\nhow restored and refreshed your learning\nability\nwas and the best way that I've been\nthinking about this in terms of sleep\nstoring or refreshing your encoding\nability and it's a crash analogy and I\ndon't mean to make a direct brain to\ncomputer analogy but think of that\nhippocampus almost like a USB stick\nthat's very good during the day at going\naround and grabbing new files but it has\na limited storage\ncapacity and what sleep was doing seemed\nto be shifting those memories from the\nUSB stick of your hippocampus over up to\nthe cortex which you can think of almost\nlike your hard drive a much bigger\nstorage capacity and by way of doing\nthat when you woke up after the nap or\nafter a full night of sleep you had this\ncleared out USB stick so what could you\ndo you could go around and start\nacquiring all these new files\nagain so that started to teach us a\nlittle bit about why sleep before\nlearning is critical but also\nmechanistically how sleep is doing this\nremarkable work of memory restoration\nwe then wanted to say well can we\ntranslate this out into the real world\nand I think there are two regions that\nwe've moved this workout into one is\neducation one is is medicine and\nAlzheimer's disease but the education\npiece was very\ninteresting in the United States I think\nthe last time I checked the average\nschool start time is somewhere around\n7:30 745 sounds about right and if you\nthink about that for 7:30 school start\ntime\nschool buses will begin leaving around\n5:30 5:45 in the morning mhm that means\nthat some kids are having to wake up at\n5:00 a.m. maybe even earlier this is\nlunacy when you think about it there's a\ngreat study in edner I hope I'm\npronouncing that correct edner which is\na small suburb or it sits in a small\nsuburb outside of Minneapolis in\nMinnesota and they shifted their school\nstart times from 7:25 5 to 8:30 in the\nmorning and then they wanted to ask what\nis the consequence of that on the\nacademic performance of their students\nand the metric that they used in these\nteenagers that they were focusing on was\nsomething called the SAT score which is\na score I had to learn when I first came\nto the United States is a critical\nassessment test that will largely\ndetermine which university you go to and\nthey did an analysis which was clever\nthey focused on the top 10% performing\nstudents which you could argue those are\nthe ones that are closest to the ceiling\nperformance and the hardest to expect\nany benefit from sleep so in the year\nbefore they made the time change the\naverage score of those top 10%\nperforming students was\n1,288 which turns out to be a pretty\ngood SAT score the following year after\nthey made the time change the average\nscore for that top 10%\nwas\n1,500 that difference is non-trivial and\nit will change exactly where those\nindividuals will go to university in\nterms of the tier of the university and\nlikely change the trajectory of their\nlives as a consequence now some people\nhave argued that data you know in terms\nof its source and its reliability may\nnot have necessarily been accurate but\nnow we've got very consistent data when\nyou start school times later academic\ngrades improve psychological and\npsychiatric problems decrease truancy\nrates\ndecrease but something else happened in\nthat story of later school start times\nthat we didn't expect which was that the\nlife expectancy of students increased\nand you think well hang on a second how\ndo you determine that the number one\ncause of death in teenagers 16 to 18 is\nactually not suicide turns out to be\nsecond it's road traffic\naccidents and here sleep matters\nenormously there was another great\nexample from tetan County in Wyoming and\nthey shifted their school start times\nfrom I think it was 7:35 in the morning\nto\n8:55 and the only thing more remarkable\nthan the extra 1 hour of sleep those\nkids reported getting was the drop in\ncar accidents that following year there\nwas a 70% reduction in car crashes in\nthat age range of 16 to 18 what time are\nthey getting out of school well they\nwill probably be ejected out of school\nthat's another interesting part by the\nway maybe around\n4:30 and people have said well look all\nof this idea of later school start times\nit means that it's going to cost us more\ncuz you've got to change the school bus\nsystem and they've argued push back\nagainst that and I would say\nprobably two things first I know it's\ndifficult and I'm not saying it's an\neasy problem to do it's a complex\nproblem and I'm sympathetic to that but\nI I think we've put people on the moon\nand so I suspect that we can also solve\nthe problem of early school start\ntimes the the other component of that\nis what are we doing as Educators if our\ngoal as educated is true truly to\neducate and not risk lives in the\nprocess then we are failing our children\nin a most spectacular manner with this\nincessant model of early school start\ntimes and if you look at the data it's\nvery clear when sleep is abundant Minds\nflourish and when it's not they\ndon't and so that's the reason why\nmyself and a whole group of sleep\nscientists we started to try to create a\nmovement for later school start times\nand we got this bill passed firstly in\nCalifornia we got it on the governor's\ndesk at the time who was governor uh\nBrown and unfortunately he didn't sign\nit into law then when the organization\nchanged and Governor nusum came in as\ngovernor of California we got the bill\nback on the on his desk and he did sign\nit and then uh the next state to go was\nNew York they started to put in\nlegislation for recommendations for\nlater school start times I think Florida\nis about to fall as well in that regard\nso there's gradual movement happening\nbut it's hard fought and it's it's\nproblematic I still think that it's it's\nimpossible to deny that data I mean it\nwas an interesting thing I remember when\nI was a professor back at Harvard we\nwere doing this work on sleep and and\nlearning and they said and it was sort\nof published in these sort of um kindly\nI don't know how we did it but in nice\njournals and they said okay based on the\nmedia attraction would you write an\neditorial for the Harvard newspaper\nwhich was called the Harvard Crimson I\nsaid I'd love to so at first I thought\nI'm just going to write a straight piece\nabout sleep and memory and why it's\nimportant then I realized no there's a\nbetter opportunity because teaching\nthere and you know this as well as I do\nthere is this bizarre system where we\nteach for an entire semester and then we\nendload the semester full of exam in\nthis stressful 2 we period and what do\nyou think is going to happen they're not\ngoing to sleep especially at a time when\nthey're trying to cram information so\nespecially in college where you don't\nactually have the material four weeks\nbefore so there's not really the option\nto learn it in advance no everything's\nabout University to me was about getting\na bunch of information and needing to\nincorporate it very quickly and then\nmove to the next item right next item\nnext item and then all of a sudden\nthere's this cataclysmic moment at the\nend of the semester and you are supposed\nto regurgitate this by cramming\neverything into your brain in this\nSleepless twoe period so rather than\nsaying look the students need to change\ntheir behavior they need to understand\nthis is problem it's not their fault I\nsaid it's us as Educators and\nadministrators we have created a system\nthat forces them to undergo deliberate\nsleep deprivation and we are educating\nthem amnesic quite\nliterally so I put this uh editorial out\nit received a um a rather Baltic if not\nArctic response and um that was the last\neditorial I was ever invited to to write\nfor the newspaper but you know you've\ngot to say your piece well so but I'm\ncurious why there's resistance to\nshifting to later School times and to\nimproving the conditions for learning if\nthe goal is to learn I mean tradition\ndies hard um maybe that's why um I think\nthere's also the idea certainly in the\nmedical profession that you know well\nwhen I was doing my training we would\npull all nighters all the time um and so\nthe idea then is that it's just part of\nThe self-directed Hazing process that is\ngetting a degree that you're going to be\ndoing a lot of allnighters and cramming\nand things of that sort is that is that\nwhy you think motivates the the\nresistance to change I think so I think\nyou've hit all the points I think you\nknow Zeitgeist die one generation at a\ntime and we see that resistance\ncertainly there\ntoo I also think that when you come back\nto later school start\ntimes they have suggested that there is\nthis cost when they tally it up but you\nmade a point which is when did they get\nout of school and let's say it's around\n4:30 one of the interesting analyses\nthat was published and we latched on to\nthis\nthat is this strange bewitching hour\nwhen kids get out of school but often\ntheir parents are not home to work and\nif you look at the Teenage Crime rate\nand you look at when those crimes are\ncommitted it's usually in that\nbewitching hour after they get out of\nschool but they don't have a home or\nparents yet to go to that filled but by\npushing school start times later they\nget out later they go home\nand if you were to even half that debt\nthat those crimes cause you would easily\npay for the education system so it's\nvery interesting I think that also\nnotion of well we went through it and\nhere I am so you can go through it too\nis very prevalent in medicine this is\nanother good\nexample we and mostly um colleagues at\nmine such as Charles Eisler at Harvard\nhave really done a great job job at\ncataloging exactly why we need to\nabandon this resident program which has\na fascinating history by the\nway which is Young residents should be\nworking 30-hour shifts often without any\nsleep whatsoever and when you look at\nthat data residents who are working a\n30-hour shift are going to be almost 460\nmore likely to make diagnostic errors in\nthe Intensive Care Unit if you have a\nsurgeon and you're getting elective\nsurgery who's had less than 6 hours of\nsleep in the previous 24 they are almost\n70% more likely to cause a surgical\nerror which could result in non-trivial\nconsequences and then the irony is that\nwhen young residents after a 30-hour\nshift get back into their car at the end\nof the shift and drive home there is\n168% increased risk that they get into a\ncar accident and then end up back in the\nER from from where they just came but\nnow as a patient rather than a physician\nand you think what are we doing I\nCharles E I think has\ndescribed they provided this evidence to\nthe council and at first they just I\nthink the idea was look our minds are\nmade up don't confuse me with the\ndata and you appeal on the empathetic\nbasis but it wasn't well received so\nthen if you go back and you say no I'm\ngoing to give you a different argument\nif you look at the cost of malpractice\ncaused by insufficient sleep and if you\nget the administrators into the room all\nof a sudden the schedules change so then\nbased on that data there was a policy\nthat you couldn't work any longer than I\nthink it was a 16h hour continuous\nshift the problem was that they only\nsaid that that was apparent for the\nfirst year residence and not the\nremaining years and the question was\nwell why I said well the data that you\nshowed us you only collected in firste\nResidence as if something magical was\ngoing to happen when you become a\nsecond-year resident and you Dawn this\nTEF long coat of immunity against sleep\ndeprivation well if anything it would\ncompound to get worse so so it seems to\nme that um there's there's like zero\nquestion that getting adequate sleep is\ngood for learning but and when the\nstakes when it's high-risk High\nconsequences scenarios or even high\nconsequences scenarios like a\nmedical situation um just seems like uh\nshould almost come down to Legal\nliability yeah I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge our sponsor ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens and is\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs by now\nI'm sure you've all heard me say that\nI've been taking ag1 since 2012 and\nindeed that is true now of course I do\nconsume regular Whole Foods every day I\nstrive to get those Foods mostly from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources however I do find it hard to get\nenough servings of fruits and vegetables\neach day so with ag1 I ensure that I get\nenough of the vitamins minerals\nPrebiotic fiber and other things\ntypically found in fruits or vegetables\nand of course I still make sure to eat\nfruits and vegetables and in that way\nprovide a sort of insurance that I'm\ngetting enough of what I need in\naddition the adaptogens and other\nmicronutrients in ag1 really help buffer\nagainst stress and ensure that the cells\nand organs and tissues of my body are\ngetting the things they need people\noften ask me that if they were going to\ntake Just One supplement what that\nsupplement should be and I always answer\nag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go\nto drink a1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer you'll get five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman so are the\nerrors of sleep deprivation in these\nscenarios both in students and medical\nprofessional are they due to errors in\nmemory per se I mean so I mean because\nyou can imagine all sorts of Errors so\nwith a surgeon they like cut the wrong\nthing or they cut too far the margin on\nthe surgical side is too big Etc but\nsince we're talking about learning in\nmemory um and its relationship to sleep\nuh is it that people are forgetting what\nthey did are they forgetting what they\ndidn't do I mean um or is it a deficit\nin motor skills or all of the above it's\nall of the above above plus which is\nthat learning in memory your\nrecollection of both what you did or\nwhat you need to do or what you should\ndo based on your training is going to be\ncompromised because your recall of that\ninformation it turns out is also\ncompromised but it's also\ndecision-making too that what we know is\nthat your frontal lobe is especially\nsensitive to a lack of sleep and it's\nthat frontal lobe that really takes\ncomplex situations to Stills them down\nand comes up with the correct output\nscenario of decisions that you need to\nmake\nnot so much when you're sleep deprived\nso how should I establish the\nproper neural millu for learning by\nsleeping prior should I make sure that I\nI mean in an Ideal World I get excellent\nnight sleep for the you know every day\nof my life leading up to about of\nlearning being Expo and here I'm\nreferring to about of learning as being\nexposed to new material\nbut life happens um so if I know that\ntomorrow I'm going to take a class in\nsomething or I'm going to need to\nperform a skill that it's pretty nent\nskill for me I only learned it recently\nwhat should I do the night\nbefore I would say think about what you\ncan get in terms of your sleep under\ncurrent conditions and understand that\nthat\nis staying awake and foregoing\nsleep is not the right equation that you\nmay think in other words think of sleep\nthat night as an investment in tomorrow\nrather than a cost opportunity of now or\ntoday that would be the message I think\nfor learning in memory some people will\nsay logically and rationally well but if\nI stay awake I can at least be learning\nand going over that material for many\nmore hours so doesn't that compensate\nfor me going to bed let's say I haven't\nlearned it well enough well surely I\nshould just you know say I I should just\nfocus and stay awake CU at least then I\ncan just go over the material Time and\nTime and Time Again doesn't that offset\nthe the deficit and to a degree it does\nwe did that study but what was really\ninteresting is that the next day were\nyou able to at least learn and recall\nsome of that information to a degree yes\nyou were and the more that you kept\ngoing over it the better you performed\neven when you were not getting\nsufficient sleep but then we did\nsomething interesting we then brought\nthem back we haven't published this this\nSt I should do we brought them back a\nmonth later and then we tested them\nagain and what you find is that the\ngroup that slept was far better able to\nhave retained and remember that\ninformation whereas the group that did\nnot sleep as much they performed much\nmore similar to the group that got a\nfull night of sleep the next day but\nwhen you test them a month later almost\nnone of that material is residing in\ntheir brain anymore got it so this is\nthe cramming effect that's right right\nand and if one knows this from teaching\nuniversity courses um or if they've\ncrammed that you can learn a bunch of\nmaterial but then you regurgitate it for\nthe exam and then it's gone yeah so so\nit's almost like a it just never passes\nfrom short-term to long-term memory\nessentially that's correct okay and that\nseems to be in some ways that's a\nbeautiful description of then what\nhappens next in the Sleep process it's\nnot just about sleep before learning you\nthen have to sleep after learning to do\nexactly what you just described\nso I have an class in the morning or I'm\ngoing to learn something new the next\nday afternoon my goal presumably should\nbe to maximize the amount of sleep I\nget and to be on the same sleep schedule\nso this gets back to qqr that was\npresented in the first episode quantity\nquality regularity and timing I people\nshould refer to that um nothing wrong\nwith your memory by the way well I don't\nknow about that but um the um the qqt\nformula was was described in the first\nepisode um let's come up with a what I\nthink is a fairly common scenario so I\nlike to go to bed early between 800 and\n900 p.m. I discovered this recently\nthanks to conversations with you this is\nclearly what works best for me I kind of\nalways inted it but I um it clearly is\nwhat works best if I go to bed at 10:00\nI probably want to wake up sometime\naround I don't know 6:00 a.m. or or 6:30\nand um if I go to bed any later than\n10:30 I start running into problems I\ndon't feel good the next day even if I\nget sufficient hours of sleep so this is\nthe importance of regularity and timing\nkeeping things more or less locked to\nthat 8:30 to 9:30 to bedtime for me 4:30\nto 5:30 wake up time that's me just by\nway of example in an Ideal World\ntherefore I would stick to that schedule\nwake up the next day and go do my\nlearning or my performance of something\nthat IID learned someone else might have\nthe chronotype we're going to bed at\n11:00 p.m. and waking up at 7:30 a.m. is\ntheir preferred schedule\nhowever often because of travel because\nof courses because of Life\ncircumstances the night before something\ncritical that we need to learn or to\nperform some critical task physical or\ncognitive the Sleep the night before is\ndisrupted in some way either by virtue\nof timing or quantity and then of course\nby extension regularity so is there\nanything that we can do heading into a\nbout of learning meaning the night\npreceding that bout of learning that can\nkind of um provide a buffer or or set us\nup for the best possible learning\nscenario if we're not able to stick to\nour perfect\nschedule I think there may be two things\nthere's been a little bit of work that's\nbeen done um to suggest that caffeine\nmay actually enhance the hippocampus\nthis memory encoding structure and boost\nits ability to encode now what they\nhaven't yet done is the study where you\nsleep deprive someone then you give them\ncaffeine the next day and then you have\nthem try to learn and ask can caffeine\nby way of its effect on the\nhippocampus rescue and restore what\nwould otherwise be an encoding deficit\nnow that is entirely possible and I\nthink it's a fascinating question by how\nmuch we don't know but if it doesn't\nit's equally likely that the hippocampus\nby way of being sleep deprived is not\nreceptive to the benefit of caffeine\nunder conditions of sleep deprivation\nand I told you in the rat studies when\nthose rats were deprived the hippocampus\nonce again became stubborn in its\nability to form new synapses and it may\nbe that it's equally stubborn to receive\nthe normal benefit of caffeine when you\nare sleep rested but I would love to do\nthat study the second is to then say\nwell if I have the choice of when I'm\ngoing to be learning during the day\nlet's say that you've had a bad night of\nsleep or you just had a short night of\nsleep non-negotiable couldn't do\nanything about it and the next day I've\ngot to cram in some information I would\nsay think about your chronotype and\nthink about when you are at your best\noperating temperature so your scenario\nlet's say going to bed at 9: waking up\nat\n4:35 your Peak is probably going to be\nmaybe 10 11:00 in the morning where your\nbiology and your Cadian rhythm is on its\nalmost Crescendo Peak at that point we\nknow for Cadian influences on learning\nand this is independent of sleep\ninfluences on learning that's where\nthings are better now for me you\nactually described me which is I'm a\nkind of an 11 to 730 type person for me\nit's probably going to be much closer to\nabout midday or 1: p.m. where I feel at\nmy operating Peak both for physical\nperformance and also mental performance\nso if you've got the choice and you are\nunderslept there's nothing you can do\nabout the sleep that you've lost the\nnight before but at least recognize that\nyour Cadian rhythm is going to come to\nyour rescue and help offset that as long\nas you time you're learning to that\nknown peak of your Cadian Rhythm does\nthat help a little bit yes that that\nmakes good sense so the idea gets us\nback to something you described in\nprevious episodes which is that you have\nthis sleep pressure due to the buildup\nof the molecule adenosine which the\nlonger we are awake the more adenosine\nin our nervous system which makes us\nsleepy but separate from that there's\nthis circadian circadia about 24-hour\nRhythm right\num that causes fairly dramatic shifts in\nwakeful fullness and sleepiness\nindependent of the adenosine signal now\nsometimes the two signals overlap so\nthat late in the evening for instance we\nhave a lot of adenosine we've been up\nall day and our circadian rhythm is such\nthat our alertness is starting to\ndiminish so they're aligned and in the\nearly part of the day assuming\neverything is normal the adenosine\nlevels are low because we slept well the\nnight before and our circadian rhythm is\non the upswing so to speak um and we are\nalert so if I understand correctly the\ngoal is to of course Maxim the quality\nquantity regularity and timing of sleep\nqqr but that in the absence of the\nability to really anchor any one of\nthose things to 10 out of 10 you know A+\nperformance if one knows that okay\ntypically around you know between 10:00\na.m. and noon is when I'm at my sharpest\nthat would be the time to be exposed to\nnew material or ideally take an exam if\none can control that sort of thing and\nthen perhaps in the afternoon there's\nanother opportunity be uh after the\npostp perenial dip that's right but\nbefore the post perenial dip sometime\nbetween 1 and 4 pm usually lasting about\nan hour to 90 minutes this is a dip\nnatural dip in energy but then after\nthat is another opportunity to learn um\nsure there'll be a lot of adenosine in\none system because you've been a long\ntime um but the Circadian system is on\nits sort of uh upswing again before the\ndown swing that occurs in the evening is\nthat right right opportunities um and by\nthe way it's strange you were to ask if\nyou look at the Cadian Rhythm right\nbefore sort of bedtime there is this\nsort of strange little blip this peak um\nthat Folks at um back at Harvard have\nhave discovered and you think well why\nwould my Cadian system which needs to\nreally ratchet down for us to get to\nsleep well why would it have this little\nJag\nupwards in the evening hours right\nbefore we need to sleep and it then\ndrops precipitously right makes no sense\nuntil you think about Evolution because\nafter foraging for food during the day\nwhat you need is this final spurt to get\nyou home safely to your nest or to your\nhome yeah to batten down the hatches\nexactly so there is this beautiful\nlittle built-in Cadian upswing to say\nokay I know you're returning to home\nthis is probably a time when there's\nsome maybe Potential Threat to you I'm\ngoing to just boost your alertness very\nquickly so you travel home safely good\nto go great and now I stopped my\ndownswing I think this is a really\nimportant thing for people to know about\num I'm familiar with the data uh\nalthough just in top Contour but the\nidea here as I understand it is that\nmany people will feel like okay around\n6:00 p.m. 6:30 they're getting sleepy\n7:30 8:00 p.m. and then they want to get\nto bed at 10:30 and suddenly for them\nbased on their chronotype around 9:00\np.m. they're like Wide Awake second wind\nright the second wind and they're like\noh no I need to sleep tonight um now\nmaybe it's the case that they a they\nwould be better off going to bed far\nearlier and waking up earlier the next\nmorning but in many cases it's just that\ntransient 45 to 6 you know 70 minute\nwindow of increased uh alertness this\nkind of um uptick in the in the\nCircadian system so to there's two shell\npass and then also just set yourself up\nfor success and we discuss a little bit\nabout the methods of really ratcheting\nthings down dimming Down the Lights\nhaving a tiet alarm these types of\nthings will just gradually back you off\nand after that second wind comes give\nyou the greatest ability to decline\nphysiologically which then permits this\nbeautiful thing called Sleep to come in\nits place well speaking of sleep post\nlearning um what is the role of sleep\nthat follows about of learning and here\nagain we want to Define learning as the\nexposure to novel information that one\nis trying to encode either cognitive\ninformation motor information or or\ncombination of the two um and I say that\nbecause learning AKA neuroplasticity has\nmany different stages it's a process not\nan event but um so let's say that uh\nearlier in the day I took a dance class\nLord knows I need one or um you and both\nor a musical lesson or was exposed to\nsome interesting information who knows\nmaybe on a podcast and I was you know\ntrying to engage in that information and\nand pay attention and then that night I\nI plan to sleep um or perhaps one could\ntake a nap after this bout of\nlearning how close to the learning\nepisode about as I'm calling it does the\nsleep have to arrive in order for sleep\nto maximize the amount of learning that\noccurs is very good question which\nis what would happen if I were to be\nlearning information and I'm listening\nto um this odd British gentleman should\nI then immediately dive into bed so that\nI maximize the retention of that\ninformation and the answer is no don't\nworry and I'll come back to why not to\nworry um but to your point not only do\nyou need sleep before learning as we've\nbeen discussing but there is something\nunique and equally necessary of and\ncausally necessary I should say for\nsleep after learning but it does\nsomething different sleep before\nlearning gets your brain ready to lay\ndown those new memory traces after\nyou've imprinted them into the brain\nsleep after learning then takes those\nfreshly minted memories and then it\nstrengthens them it all essentially it's\nalmost like sleep will hit the save\nbutton on those new memories so that you\ndon't forget so in other words sleep is\nfuture proofing that information within\nyour brain so that you don't\nforget and then the question and we've\nbeen able to and we and many others have\nreplicated this in fact it's nothing new\nif you look at the literature on this\nsleep after learning um\ngig it goes back as best we can tell to\n1929 although I'll argue with that in a\nsecond but two researchers Jenkins and\ndback did a landmark study they had\nparticipants learn a whole bunch of\nnonsense syllables and they had them\nlearn them over and over and over again\nand gradually they got better and then\nthey started to test them across an 8\nhour period they tested them 2 hours\nlater 4 hours later 6 hours later and 8\nhours later the only difference is that\nin one of those testing sessions that 2\nhours 4 hours 6 hours 8 hours was a\ncross awaking day in the other they had\nthem learn that information to near\nPerfection before sleep just as they did\nin the waking group but now they woke\nthem up after 2 hours and tested them\nafter 4 hours and tested them after 6\nhours and then again when they woke up\nin the morning 8 hours later and what\nthey found is that in those people who\nstayed awake after learning there was\nessentially just catastrophic forgetting\nthe amount of information 2 hours 4\nhours 6 hours 8 hours later just\ndeclined dramatically\nbut when they repeated that in the same\nindividuals after learning things to the\nsame degree 2 hours 4 hours later memory\nwas starting to decline but after about\ntwo and a half three hours of being\nasleep all of a sudden sleep had fixated\nthose memories almost like um like an\nanimal that's been trapped in Amber and\nset in Amber like a fossil and then\nthose memories just would not Decay any\nfurther and you retained them what was\nstunning about that study is it has been\nreplicated time and time again that's\nnot the surprising part the surprising\npart is that in that study they tested a\nvast number of subjects in fact a sum\ntootal of two\nparticipants but what's stunning is that\nthat finding has gone and been\nreplicated time and time again so that\ndemonstrated to us that there's\nsomething special about sleep that is\nconcretizing almost literally like\ntaking things and setting it in\nconcrete and then the question became\nagain mechanistically how how is it and\nit's important to understand mechanism\nbecause it has ramifications for\ndiseases and Medicine how is sleep doing\nthis fantastic saving of memories and we\nnow have at least two non-mutually\nexclusive mechanisms so in other words\nboth seem to occur the first is what we\ncall memory translocation\nsleep and particularly what we found for\nfact-based memories and I should note by\nthe way that this story of sleep after\nlearning is a two-part or it runs in two\ndifferent narratives one is sleep after\nlearning for fact-based memory what we\ndescribe as declarative memory and\nyou've uh done a fantastic uh previous\nepisode on working memory and describe\nall of these different types of memory\nso one story line has been sleep after\nlearning for fact-based memory but the\nother which is equally interesting is\nsleep for non declarative or procedural\nskill memory in other words what we\nthink of as motor memory but I'll come\nback to motor memory in a\nsecond what we then found for this sleep\nand textbook like memory is that there\nare two mechanisms the first\ntranslocation and here what we found is\nthat it's deep nonrem sleep for\nfact-based memories and it's those big\nslow powerful brain waves that we spoke\nabout in the first episode combined with\nthose sleep spindles that ride on top of\nthem almost like a surfer on a huge\namplitude\nwave and it's the combination of those\ntwo brain waves that acts like a file\ntransfer mechanism and it moves and\nshifts memories from a short-term\nvulnerable Reservoir the hippocampus to\nthe more permanent long-term storage\nsite the cortex in the brain and\ntherefore protect protecting them and\nmaking them\nsafe so that's one mechanism is the the\nshifting of memories around the brain\nand through different storage sites from\nshort term to long\nterm the second I think is perhaps even\nmore fascinating it's called memory\nreplay and this was discovered back in\nthe probably 1990s Bruce mcnorton um at\nthe University of Arizona working with a\nyoung Matt Wilson who not uh Matt Walker\nhe's Matt Wilson at MIT now\nthey were looking at rats and they were\nlooking at how rats learn a maze and\nthey had these electrodes in these\nhippocampal brain regions um these\nmemory related regions that we've been\ndiscussing and they were listening to\nthe individual firing patterns of those\nmemory cells in the hippocampus as they\nwere running around the Maze and sure\nenough as they ran around the maze\nstatistically you would build up what\nlooked like the signature pattern of\nlearning so think about those neurons\nthat they each had a special tone to\nthem and as the rat is running around\nthe maze you can hear the signature of\nlearning and just me it over and over\nagain but then they did something clever\nwhen the rats went to sleep after\nlearning they kept\nlistening what did they hear they didn't\njust hear noise they heard that same\nmemory signature replayed\nhowever it wasn't replayed at the same\nspeed it was replayed somewhere between\n10 to 20 times faster so now all of a\nsudden instead of\nhearing you\nheard just going over and over again and\nwhat we've learned is that this replay\nof memories for that type of information\nnow for rats that's the version\nessentially of that spatial navigation\nis their version of fact-based memory\nand I won't go into detail but yeah cuz\nnavigating novel environments is\nespecially important for all species but\nrodents to know where they cashed food\nwhere escapes are and things of that\nsort yeah perhaps even more so than as\nhumans that locational memory is\nnecessary and nowadays there's Google\nMaps and Uber and things of that sort\nbut in the the old days as it were I\nrecall the the London taxi drivers were\nconsidered the um you know the world\nheavyweight champions of of uh memory\nand there were some decent brain imag\nstudies of their hippocamp ey and indeed\nthey have amazing spatial memory of the\ncity of London um now that's probably\nchanged because of Google Maps there\nthere's no need to rely on on um\ninternal memory stores when you have no\nyou still actually there's still a now\nyou can drive you know these ridea apps\nbut for London taxi drivers they still\nhave to go through in some ways it's\nalmost like a hazing it's called the\nknowledge and if you if you are visiting\nLondon you will see these strange guys\nwho are going around on mopeds and they\njust have this huge kind of map in front\nof them and they are doing the knowledge\nwhich is that they are learning\nexquisitly the entire road map of London\nand what they found in those studies was\nthat the size of the hippocampus this\nmemory structure related to fact-based\nmemories and also spatial memories was\nsignificantly larger in cab drivers than\nit was in matched controls now you could\nsay well this is a self- selecting\nprocess\nthat people who already have large\nhippocampi as we would say they're just\ngoing to be the people who can do the\nknowledge well and pass as it were but\nwhat they also found was that a\ncorrelation the longer that you've been\ndoing the knowledge and being a taxi\ndriver the bigger and bigger your\nhippocampus so it's time on task so\ncoming back to the the the rats in this\nspatial learning it's almost as though\nsleep after learning is taking that\nmemory trace and it's like etching into\na glass surface you just go over that\nmemory circuit over and over again and\nyou're strengthening that memory\ncircuit what was also fascinating\nhowever I would I'm telling you that\nit's during non-r sleep that you do all\nof this memory replay and certainly what\nwe found is that for textbook memory\nit's deep non-rem sleep that's the\nimportant stage of sleep but Matt Wilson\npublished at MIT an interesting study\nlooking at REM sleep what happens to the\nmemory Trace in REM sleep and REM sleep\nwhich we know is associated with\ndreaming there the memory replay didn't\nslow back down to normal waking speed it\nslowed down even further to point five\ntimes relative to waking speed so the\nwaking speed versus the dreaming speed\nin dreaming sort of in REM sleep I\nshould say because we don't know if rats\ndream or not but in REM sleep things had\nslowed down by essentially\n50% and this comes back to our\nconversation in a previous episode that\nwe had about time and you and I were\ndiscussing how there's this strange\nphenomenon where you are woken up by\nyour alarm and you're in a dream and you\nhave a snooze button that lasts 5\nminutes you hit the snooze button you go\nback to sleep and you feel as though\nyou've been dreaming for I don't know 10\nminutes 15 minutes but it's been 5\nminutes in the real world but time has\nslowed down time has dilated it's almost\nlike a satina that's stretched out and\nall of a sudden we were finding in or\nMatt Wilson because we don't do animal\nresearch was finding that this replay\nwas slowed down by 50% so I always\nwonder whether or not there is neuronal\nevidence that helps us explain why\ndreams seem to pack more\ntime despite being in real world time a\nshorter amount absolutely fascinating\nyeah I have to imagine that um rat dream\nand dog dream and other animal stream I\nmean why wouldn't they um you know if uh\nall the components of REM sleep that are\nexpressed in humans appear in these\nanimals and vice versa you imagine it\nalmost has to be the case it does and I\nthink there is some interesting\nsupportive evidence that you can argue\nthere is a sleep disorder that we\nunderstood in humans first called rapid\neye movement disorder or REM sleep\nbehavioral disorder and in the first\nepisode we said that one of the\nfascinating features of REM sleep which\nis when we principally dream is that\nyour brain and specifically your brain\nstem paralyzes your body so that your\nmind can dream safely so you're shut\ndown into this motor paralysis\nincarceration rightly\nso but what also happens is that as we\nget older it seems to be particularly\nmore so in men than in women but it can\nbe both both once we get past our 50s\nthere's a higher likelihood that that\nmechanism starts to\ndegrade and you can start to act out\nyour dreams now this is not sleepwalking\nor sleeptalking that actually comes from\ndeep non-rm sleep and there what happens\nis that there is a trigger an Awakening\neither a brain response almost like a\nstress response that wakes the brain up\nand you're in the deepest stages of\nsleep and you are trying to get forced\nback up to wakefulness sort of the back\nto that analogy of going from the\nbasement to the to the penthouse and\ninstead you just get locked into this\nmixed state of consciousness of and as a\nconsequence you start to enact very rot\nbasic behaviors you'll go over to the\nrefrigerator open the door close the\ndoor pick up a glass put it to your\nmouth put it back down and if you wake\nsomeone up which you shouldn't\nnecessarily do unless there's there's\nharm that and ask them what was going\nthrough your mind just a few minutes\nminutes ago they all say nothing and the\nreason is because it wasn't coming from\ndream sleep it was from deep non-re\nsleep I see however there is a very\ndifferent condition that sometimes\npeople will mix up as the very same\nthing which is REM sleep behavioral\ndisorder and there you're acting out\nyour dreams it can be quite violent some\npeople have enacted violence on their\npartner and woken up and being\nabsolutely\ndevastated I bring this up however\nbecause human beings are not the only\nspecies that suffers from REM sleep\nBehavioral disorder dogs suffer from\nthis as well and when you see it and you\ncan understand it's very clear you have\nelectrodes on the head they go into this\nREM sleep State and all of a sudden they\ncome out of the paralysis and they start\nenacting what very much looks like a\nbehavior of wakefulness it's quite\ncomplex and at that point you look at\nthat and you\nsay okay I'm I'm sorry but that looks\nvery much like dreaming now we can't of\nof course ask dogs a question you know\nwhat was going through your mind you can\nask them but they're not going yeah but\nyeah you can ask them but it turns out\nthat the response is is less than it's\njust a look to say give me a treat but\nyou know in science sometimes if it\nlooks like a duck talks like a duck\nwalks like a duck maybe it's a\nduck what what about um this phenomenon\nwhich I've experienced before of being\nasleep presumably in rapid eye movement\nsleep and being completely paralyzed but\nthen waking up and I'm still in\nparalysis but I'm not asleep and um this\nwas a long time ago uh probably the 10th\ngrade which for me I was what 15 years\nold I'm 48 now and um it was at a party\nthat I I fell asleep on the couch and I\ngoodness I I don't believe in underage\ndrinking but there's a there's a\npossibility that I might have been\ninebriated I I\nwas kids parents that you know I I just\nI actively dissuade young people from\ndrinking and many older people from\ndrinking but yeah I started drinking far\ntoo young um and but I remember I drank\nthe night before I got drunk the night\nbefore again something I'm not um\nsuggesting or proud of I woke up and I\nwas wide awake gosh I remember this so\nwell and I was paralyzed I could not\nmove and it was terrifying and then all\nof a sudden boom I could jolt myself\nawake and I was like oh my goodness and\num it must have been in an invasion of\nthat atonia that sleep induced paralysis\ninto the waking state so I can explain\nthis and you have this is the perfect\nprototypical situation when we see this\nwhat you're describing to me is\nsomething that many people listening\nwill have experienced called REM sleep\nparalysis and it's not necessarily a\nproblem or a sign of a condition that\nyou need to be worried about although if\nit's happening frequently we can think\nabout that what Norm happens when we\nwake up out of REM sleep and REM sleep\nas we spoke about in the first episode\ndominates the second half of the night\nand particularly the last quarter of the\nnight as you're coming out of REM sleep\nand waking up out of REM sleep which you\nknow you've got a 50/50% chance perhaps\ncu the other state that you're in a\nstage two light non remm as you're\ncoming out of REM sleep you're regaining\nConsciousness to the external world and\nthen normally in lock step with that\nperfect lock step if not a little before\nyour brain is realizing this and it's\nreleasing you from the paralysis and we\nall wake up and we don't even think\nabout it I just wake up and I lean over\nI turn off you know the alarm and I get\nout of bed everything's fine every now\nand again however the waking up and\nConsciousness re-engaging occurs however\nthe brain does not release you from the\nREM sleep paralysis so at that point\nit's almost like a locked in body\nphenomenon and it's very frightening\nbecause because you begin to be aware of\nyour surroundings but you cannot make\nany voluntary movements because I told\nyou that the voluntary sceletal muscle\nsystem is imper by the atonia the\nabsence of muscle your involuntary\nyou're still breathing and all but your\neyelids turn out to be part of\nyour voluntary muscle set so you can't\nlift up your eyelids and then normally\nwhat happens is that it's associated\nwith a strong sense of often an in Ruder\nit seems to be if you're doing it sort\nof in bed by yourself at home now your\ncontext was a little different and it\nturns out that if you look at these\ndescriptions of sleep paralysis where\nyou can't wake up you can't shout out\nyou can't move you have this sense of\nanother presence or another being in the\nroom it adequately explains most if not\nall alien abduction stories because when\nwas the last time you saw a news article\nor on the news that someone said okay\ntoday it was very clear that Jimmy in\nWisconsin in the middle of the day was\nabducted by aliens and everyone saw it\nyou know you're at the meeting table and\nwhoosh what happened that was Jimmy he\njust got whisked off by alien doesn't\nhappen that way it's normally that\nyou're in bed at night it's the early\nmorning hours just before you're waking\nup these aliens came into the room they\ninjected something into you they\nparalyzed you you couldn't shout you\ncouldn't move\nit's simply REM sleep paralysis now when\ndo we see that there are ways and not\nways because these are not protocols\nthat we advise there are circumstances\nwhere the probability of that increases\nand I've experienced this too when you\nare sleep deprived or you are highly\nstressed the likelihood that you will\nexperience these REM sleep paralysis\nevents upon Awakening is increased and\nfor me it was happening when I was um a\na young uh PhD student and I was\nstudying sleep and then I would be awake\nall night because I'd be monitoring the\npatients and looking at their sleep the\nirony of sleep studies exactly that you\nhave to deprive yourself of the very\nthing that you are trying to study and\nis which by the way gives you some\namazing insights for experiments that\nI've had as a consequence not that I\nwould advise that as the way and we'll\ncome on to why that's not wise when we\nspeak about creativity but we were um\ndoing these studies and then I would go\nhome and then I would take a short\nperiod of sleep maybe just 2 and 1 half\nhours of\nsleep and then I would wake up I didn't\nwant to cuz I was ready to go deep into\nsleep but I would wake up and then I\nwould force myself to be awake\nthroughout the day and try to get to bed\nat a reasonable time because if I slept\nall day what's going to happen I'm just\ngoing to be awake all the next night and\nI'm going to be out of my rhythm but\nwhat's interesting is that when I would\nwake up then I would be waking up maybe\nat 10 10 a.m. in the morning 11: and at\nthat point if you're sleeping there with\nsomeone like my face you are in a very\nREM sleep Desiring state that it's in\nthose last morning hours and into the\nearly morning hours when your brain\nwants to devour off the menu of sleep\nstages this thing called REM in vast\nquantities so I was sleep deprived Point\nnumber one second I was going into a\nvery REM sleep Rich phase in other words\nhigher likelihood of paralysis and that\noccurred to me your description is also\nprototypical you've been drinking the\nnight before went out to the party we\nspoke about in one of our previous\nepisodes that one of the problems with\nalcohol is that it's very good at\nblocking your REM sleep so you'd been\nabsent of REM sleep the PRI night you\nbuilt up what we call a REM sleep debt\nand when you slept all of a sudden what\nyour brain wanted more because it at\nleast got some sleep and there you're\ngoing to get mostly your deep sleep the\ndeath on the sheets of your balance\naccount for sleep was not so great for\ndeep nonrem but you were very much in\ndebt with REM so what happened as soon\nas you conked out on the couch whoosh\nyou were probably straight into REM\nsleep and then when you woke up you had\nthis mismatch in timing between\nConsciousness and the release of\nparalysis what did you experience REM\nsleep paralysis love it I mean hate it I\ndid not enjoy it but I love your\ndescription it's because it makes so\nvery clear what happened and for those\nthat have had the experience it can be\nmildly stressful to terrifying so thank\nyou for um providing the therapy that is\nknowledge and uh so that people don't\nstress it too much but we still dissuade\npeople from consuming alcohol prior to\nsleep correct I want to take a brief\nbreak and

to\nmove let's talk about the ability to\nmove meaning motor learning what is the\nrelationship between sleep and learning\nphysical skills either coordination of\nmotor movement or who knows maybe\nincreased power output or endurance um\nand if you would could you comment on\nwhether or not there are specific phases\nof sleep that are specifically linked to\nmotor learning yeah great questions so\nwhat we've spoken about so far is that\nyou need sleep after learning for that\ntextbook like memory and that is one\ncategory of memory that resides within\nyour brain there's another type of\nmemory that you've spoken about which\nmany of us don't realize is memory and\nthat's what we call non- declarative or\nprocedural skill memory so if I were to\nyou know ask you okay Andrew you know\nlast night for dinner or yesterday for\nlunch do you remember what it was that\nyou had to eat and my guess is that you\ncould probably tell me so do you recall\nwhat what some of that my diet is pretty\nboring um in the sense I tend to eat\nmore or less the same thing every day\nalthough I'm open to being flexible\nyesterday for lunch I had two grass-fed\nhamburger patties maybe a little bit of\nrice sliced cucumber some tomatoes and\nbecause I'm a driveby blueberry eater\nthere were some blueberries out on the\ncounter and I had several large fistfuls\nof those and then I washed it down with\nsome water and I half mug just like this\nof some cold brew sugar-free yerba mate\nand I can confirm folks I was there at\nthe incident and that's exactly what he\nhad but did everyone who was watching or\nlistening just realize what happened in\nthis room today something that Einstein\nsuggested would never be possible that\nAndrew just travel back in time that\nusing this Incredible Gift of memory you\nyou folded time almost like a concertina\ncompressing it and you race back within\nmilliseconds you were shaking your head\nyes I know what I had and you race back\ninto that catalog of all of your\nprevious lunches you found the correct\nmanila folder for that specific lunch\nall of the details and out it popped\nthat is a spectacular complex\ncomputational process that your brain's\nmemory system accomplished Within\nmilliseconds it's stunning what we have\nas this gift of memory but as I said\nthere's another type of memory so if I\nwere to ask you okay how do you ride a\nbike it's very difficult there is no\ntextbook for here is how to ride a bike\nthe way that you do it when you're a\nchild is that you are taught how to\nlearn how to ride a bike by being on it\nso if I were to say how cuz I'm a\nlongtime cyclist how do I take uh a\nright turn with my bicycle the obvious\nsuggestion would be well you turn the\nhandlebars if you turn the handlebars at\n30 m an hour trying to go around a right\nBend you going crash very quickly what\nin fact you do is you alter the steering\nangle just a little but you\nlean and that is what we call non\ndeclarative meaning you can't declare to\nme what it is that you know you just\nhave to show me through action and\nbehavior this is skill learning and we\nuse it for things like sports surgical\nprocedures flying planes there are so\nmany musical performance as well so many\naspects so we wanted to then say well\nsleep is helpful after learning for\nfact-based memory but what about this\nother type of memory and in truth I\ndidn't come up with the idea it was\ngiven to me back in the gosh I'm aging\nmyself in the early 2000s I was back in\nthe UK I gave a lecture at the for the\ndecade of the brain which it was back\nthen and at the end of the course I'd\nspoken a little bit about sleep and this\ninformational processing but no evidence\nfor motor skill memory and this\ngentleman be lovely gentleman Old\nGentleman with a sort of a white beard I\nremember his tweed jacket this green Hue\nwas beautiful and he came up to me at\nthe end and he said look I'm a musician\nI'm a Pianist and I was fascinated by\nwhat you said about sleep sometimes I'll\nsit down and I'm learning a new piece\nand I just don't seem to be able to get\nit and I practice practice and practice\ninto the evening and then I just stop\nand then I come back the next day and I\nsit down at the piano and I can just\nplay do you think that's\nsleep and of course at that moment my\nmind starts just relexing with ideas and\nI'm thinking gosh there's the next 10\nyears of my work and grants and so I\nsort of said look I I think it's a\nfascinating hypothesis it could also be\nthat you're just maybe a little bit\ntired in the evening and but it's it's\nentirely possible I don't know of any\nevidence yet that supports that I\nsuppose the alternative hypothesis that\nthere's simply a certain amount of time\nthat needs to elapse After experiencing\nsomething new that one wants to learn\nthe trigger for learning is I don't know\nsome biochemical SL neural signal that's\nlike a wavefront and it takes a while\nfor that wave to go ashore which is\nlearning and that independent of how\nmuch sleep one gets or the quality of\nsleep that the learning could occur I\nsuppose that's one idea no that's in\nfact precisely the central hypothesis\nthat we then set out to test which is\nthat your maybe it's it's practice then\nsome time that helps you create that\nperfect motor routine that's one\nhypothesis but let's split that apart\nmaybe it's time but time spent awake or\nis it time but time spent asleep so we\ndesigned a study to disambiguate between\nthose two both groups learned a motor\nskill task and it's very much like\nlearning a piano and you learn a\nsequence of movements let's just say\n41324 and we have you type that out over\nand over again for periods of 30 seconds\nand then you rest for 30 seconds and\nthen you do it again you do 12 of those\ntrials and sure enough practice seemed\nto get you better and you were learning\nand your learning curve went up and then\nwe brought those participants back 12\nhours later and we retested them on that\nsame motor memory half of those\nparticipants spent that 12 hours awake\nthe others had a night of sleep in\nbetween an 8 Hour night of sleep when we\nbrought the people who had learned in\nthe morning and tested in the evening\nwithout sleep they had retained that\nmemory they were no worse they were just\nno better but in the people who had\nslept\nwhat was stunning was that they had\nimproved their performance output speed\nby 20% and they'd improved their\naccuracy by almost\n37% wow so in other words it wasn't time\nthat you needed to produce Perfection it\nwas time with sleep in other words\nyou've often heard the statement\npractice makes perfect but we violated\nthat edict it wasn't practice that makes\nperfect it's practice with a night of\nsleep that makes or leads to perfection\nin other words after learning your brain\ncontinues to improve in the absence of\nany further practice however that\nlearning occurs exclusively during\nperiods of offline sleep and not across\nequivalent time periods while you're\nawake now what was interesting in the\ngroup that remained awake across those\n12 hours\nwe then actually brought them back after\na further 12 hours but now after a night\nof sleep and they showed that beautiful\nbenefit so the\nsleep that can let's say enhance\nalthough I think what we're really\ntalking about here that consolidates\nmotor learning yeah can arrive the night\nafter meaning one finishes let's say\nlearning at I don't know 11:00 a.m. and\nthen they sleep later that night or the\nfollowing night and in both instances\nthat sleep can enhance or let's say\nconsolidate the motor learning that\noccurred that's right so it was to your\nquestion actually that we discussed\nearlier and I recall now I didn't answer\nit which is that you the things that you\nlearn throughout the day you don't have\nto worry about learning them really\nclose to bedtime so that they're\navailable and accessible for this sleep\ndependent work of sleep after learning\nit seems to be that the human\nbrain and we've plotted this we've\nlooked at how\nat what point does the brain sort of\nfail in terms of its ability to place on\nhold sort of on the runway ready to take\noff into the consolidation phase and it\nseems to be about 16 hours MH that you\ncan hold on to those freshly formed\nmemories for about 16 hours and then you\nget the chance to sleep and consolidate\nthem so if you learn at 11:00 in the\nmorning or if you learn at 7:00 p.m. in\nthe evening don't worry about that those\nmemories are still going to be gathered\ntogether in the beautiful receptive arms\nof sleep and then knitted up and\nenhanced when it comes to procedural\nmemories and by the way that's a key\ndifference to those two types of memory\nsleep will take fact based memories and\nsimply save them so that you don't\nforget it doesn't necessarily boost them\nanymore it just simply prevents you from\nForgetting which is what would happen\notherwise across a waking day ah key\npoint it's it's not enhancement it's\nconsolidation of or\nessentially\num the way I might think about it is the\nnew information is put into a potential\nmemory bank and that information is\neither flushed or maintained depending\non whether or not you get sleep that's\nright there's no enhancement enhancement\nwould be supranormal levels of memory if\nyou sleep and that's the case for\ntextbook like memory in other words\nsleep comes in and it stems the blood\nflow of forgetting from the memory wound\nas it were to get I don't know why it\ncame up that's a terrible analogy no I\nlike it I guess we might say Hemorrhage\nright like it is okay and but so sleep\ncomes in and prevents that from\nhappening but with motor memories it is\nenhancement it's that when you're awake\nacross the day you don't get any worse\nwhich is what happens with fact textbook\nmemory you hold that performance but\nthen sleep comes in and it boosts you\neven further\nyou get a nice benefit without doing\nanything\nfurther so then the question became to\nyour point if sleep is doing that if\nit's not practice that makes perfect but\npractice with sleep what is it about the\nsleep so we looked at their sleep\nphysiology and what we found were two\ninteresting components first it seemed\nto be related to that lighter form of\nstage two nonrem sleep I told you that\ntextbook memory requires deep non-rem\nsleep stages three and four casting back\nto episode one motor memory more\ndependent on stage two and those\nbeautiful spindles that are the Hallmark\nof beginning your stage two the more of\nthose that you had the greater the\nmemory benefit the next day we then\nwanted to say well is this effect simply\nsomething to do with the\nnighttime because that's the other\nhypothesis it's not really about sleep\nit's just something about night ESS\nbecause in all of the studies i'\ndescribed so far they're all happening\nat night and at night they were sleeping\nso is it really nighttime or is it\nspecifically sleep so now we did a nap\nstudy with motor skill learning we\nrepeated that and sure enough even\nthough that time period was across the\nday not during night n they showed this\nbeautiful motor skill benefit if they\nnapped versus if they did not and then\nin that naps City I was telling you that\nthey were learning the sequence with the\num right non-dominant hand and they were\nall we selected all right handers to to\nmake it equal and they were typing 41324\n41324 and that right hand as well you\nknow is controlled by the left motor\ncortex so after in the nap study when we\nrecorded their sleep we used very high\ndensity EEG so lots and lots of sensors\non top of the head so we could map with\nHigh Fidelity resolution the surface of\nthe brain or the surface of the scalp\nand infer what's going on in the brain\nand what was interesting is that yes\nthose sleep spindles the more of them\nthat you had in the nap the better your\nmotor skill learning was but there\nseemed to be a lateralized effect such\nthat the Sleep spindle activity on the\nright side of the brain which controls\nthe left hand which was not working that\nshowed no spindle increased in activity\nhowever on the right hand activity that\ninvoked activation in the left motor\ncortex that left motor cortex and\nspecifically Al the hand region showed a\nlocal increase in spindle activity and\nsubsequent work and work prior to our\nhad demonstrated that it's not sleep\nphysiology globally it's almost as\nthough your sleep physiology responds to\nthe mapping of the memory in the brain\nwherever the memory is that's where\nsleep when you go to sleep sort of\nstarts massaging the cortex so that you\nget that plasticity it's almost like a\ngood masseuse you know you sort of sit\ndown they say where are your problem\npoints and you say it's it's here and\nhere and so they don't give you a\ngeneral massage they go to work on the\nregions that have been working hardest\nthat require greatest attention sleep\ndoes that it's a amazing and reminds me\nof some of this work that was done I\nthink in the late 90s early 2000s\nRichard Morris and um colleagues over in\nI think he was in Edinburgh\num talked about synaptic tagging you\nknow this notion that animals or humans\nperform or learn some new motor skill\nmaybe navigation of a novel environment\nmaybe a motor skill of the 41234 that\nyou described you know keys on a piano\nor something like that and then it was\nacknowledged that the the changes in the\nconnections between neurons don't occur\nimmediately which meant that there had\nto be some sort of tag or label to the\nsynapsis that marked them for\nconsolidation later for plasticity\nlong-term potentiation things of that\nsort the names don't really matter um I\nthink later it became clear based on\nMarcus Frank's work and others that\nindeed during sleep the hard rewiring of\nthe nervous system occurs plasticity\noccurs but what you're saying is that\nthere's a high degree of\nspecificity meaning the specific\ncircuits that were active and required\nfor the learning are the specific\ncircuits that are modified which on the\nface of it one could say well of course\nwhat that means is that during sleep the\nbrain is um somehow able to uh the\nneurons of the brain that is are able\nto chemically or electrically or both\nsignal like this is where that there\nneeds to be some modifications done and\nthen then like a night crew um the the\nbrain self- induces its own changes\nwhich is remarkable it really is it's\nalmost as though there are red flags\nthat are planted in the territories that\nhave undergone learning dependent\nplasticity and they are calling out\nalmost like you know hungry mouths that\nare in plasticity famine for the feast\nrelief that comes by way of sleep do we\nknow what the factors are that are\nreleased in sleep that allow that to\noccur or is it I'm guessing there are\nmany people love to talk about brain\nderived neutrophic Factor bdnf but which\nis a very interesting molecule but um\nit's probably just one of a panoply of\nof molecules that are that are important\nwe we don't know necessarily the\nneurochemical processes although some\npeople have manipulated plasticity and\nthen blocked it with different types of\nnmda which is a certain type of receptor\nin the brain for excitatory activity\nwhich is the underlying basis of brain\nplasticity so that certainly is\ndependent but what's interesting about\nthe sleep spindles I said in the first\nepisode that they burst somewhere\nbetween about 12 to 15 times per\nsecond if you apply that type of\nstimulation to a particular neuronal\ncircuit within the brain that seems to\nbe one of the and it's not the only but\none of the ideal sort of Sweet Spot\ntickling of neurons that forces them to\nsay oh I think I should strengthen this\ncircuit so it's almost as though these\nsleep spindles are ideally designed at\nthe frequency at the sort of tickling\nlevel of neurons to stimulate exactly\nwhat we think is the underlying basis of\nstrengthening a memory which is at the\nlevel of the neurons the\nstrengthening of synapses so interesting\num because we hear this fire together\nwire together high frequency\ntransmission between neurons is what\ncreates plasticity but this is literally\na replay of previously meaning earlier\nthat day or the previous day as you\npointed out activity in the given\ncircuit being replayed not unlike the\nthe the work that you talked about\nearlier the fast replay of neurons in in\nthe hippocampus but here it's not\nnecessarily just in the hippocampus it\ncan be in the neocortex or other\nstructures that then builds up the uh\nthe the Vigor with which that circuit\ncan function in the daytime AKA learning\num is it's super interesting you\nmentioned that this is occurring largely\nin stage two of sleep not in rapid eye\nmovement sleep is this business of stage\ntwo being the the main period of sleep\nin which motor learning occurs unique to\nmotor learning in other words cognitive\ninformation um surely can get um wired\ninto the brain at night but is that\nlargely Associated just with rapid eye\nmovement sleep what this would suggest\nin other words is that the earlier\nstages of sleep 1 and two and heading\ninto three and four serves a specific\npurpose which\nis consolidation of motor skills and and\nmotor learning from the previous one or\ntwo days it does seem to be that stage\ntwo stage one is we now think of more of\na transitional stage but we will speak\nperhaps when we discuss the idea of\ncreativity that it also may have a\nmemory function that very light first\nstep of sleep stage two is certainly\nrelated to motor skill in fact stage two\nis fascinating we used to think of it as\njust the stage that you had to go into\nto get to deep sleep and the stage that\nyou had to go back through to get up to\nREM sleep never made any sense to me why\nbecause stage two non-r sleep is about\n40 to 50% of your night why would you\nspend 40 to 50% of your time asleep when\nit's just simply a gate to get to\nsomething better you would spend more\ntime in the something to something\nthat's better stages\nso we started to find functions and\nstage two is dist distributed throughout\nthe night but those sleep spindles in\nstage two are not evenly distributed\nthroughout the night you get some of\nthem in the first quarter more of them\nin the second quarter of sleep certainly\nmore in the third quarter but you get a\nlot more of those sleep spindles in the\nlast quarter of the night and in fact\nwhen we looked at the overnight study\nwhere we' had people learn in the\nevening tested the next day we recorded\ntheir sleep in between\nyes sleep spindles predicted and stage\ntwo predicted how much better they were\nthe next day but it was especially stage\ntwo in the last quarter of the night\nlet's say I'm going to bed at I'm just\nfor argument sake for ease midnight and\nI'm waking up at 8 it's in that sort of\n6:00 a.m. to 8 a.m. range when I if I\nwas going to sleep at that time would be\ngetting my stage two and I find that\ninteresting because it is the time of\nnight that we all feel it's okay to cut\nshort to get a jump start on the day\nit's this Modern Life erosion of our\nsleep time and what these findings would\nsuggest is that you are short changing\nyour brain of some significant motor\nmemory performance especially those\nclassic Olympic coaches that have their\nAthletes Training until you know 8 in\nthe evening and then you know they're in\nbed by sort of 10 or 11: but they have\nthem waking up at 5: back on the\nathletic field at 6 but they would gain\nsome additional motor memory benefit if\nyou just let them sleep a little bit\nlonger I recall there was a study done\nat Stanford relatively small study um\nbut interesting nonetheless because I\nthink it was the basketball team that\nwas asked to um spend I think an\nadditional two hours in bed there a\nsleep extensions today um and they were\neven told that they could do other\nthings in bed uh besides sleep um there\nmight have been some specifications of\nyou know things they should not do in\nbed during that time um but at least by\nself-report some of the students said\nthat they slept a bit more or they\nrelaxed a bit more in bed and indeed\nwhen compared to the control group there\nwas a significant Improvement in their\num I forget if it was three throw free\nthrow percentage excuse me um or other\nmetrics of a basketball performance yeah\nit was the point scoring performance it\nwas the speed up and down the court and\nit was a great study done by Sher Mah at\nuh Stanford University um and she's done\nepic work with athletes to to sort of\nreplicate those findings and the athlete\nstory is interesting some people may be\nsaying well didn't you just make a hop\nskip and a jump from you know 41324 to\ninferring complex motor skill I thought\nabout that so we did a a new series of\nstudies where we this is control that's\nthe nice thing about the sort of typing\non a sequence you can really measure\nthat performance with high sort of\naccuracy but we then switched it to a b\nmanual task much more like learning to\nplay a piano and you were learning\nsequences that were 12 14 items in\nlength and you had to learn them over\nand over and we had a hypothesis would\nsleep fail at the the task when motor\nskill performance became much more\ncomplex or would it be different and\nwhat we found was that the more and more\ncomplex the motor skill became the\ngreater and the greater the benefit of\nsleep um by way of that consolidation\neffect and then I started to hear\nsomething cuz I would often be in the\nroom as these participants were learning\nthe sequence and then as they were\ntesting and my ears started to hear\nsomething that I I couldn't quite\nbelieve to begin with they would start\nto learn these motor\nsequences but they would seem to have\nthese pauses and it's what we call\nchunking in motor skill memory so\ninstead of 41324 41324 they would do\n41324\n41324 and I would have them be using the\nsame keyboard and I got to know the\nsound of the the keyboard so I could\nhear it 41324 41324 and then when they\ncame back the next day yes they were\nperforming faster but they weren't just\ndoing 413 2 4\n41324 they were simply doing 413 24 4 3\nthere was no Gap at all so we went into\nthe individual responses individual\nmotor sort of finger responses and sure\nenough before sleep there were these\nvery clear problem points on these pain\npoints in the motor memory sequence but\nthen when we came back after a night of\nsleep and looked at their data it wasn't\nas though sleep simply grabbed the motor\nskill memory sort of profile and lifted\neverything up sleep was selectively\ngoing after those pain points and\nimproving them and that to me was\ninteresting because that's the goal of a\ngood athlete it is\nautomaticity you don't want to be\nthinking about it at some point you go\nfrom a very conscious Act of\ndeliberately trying to remember what you\nshould be doing to then not thinking\nabout it at all it's only automaticity\nthat gives you that ability not to think\nand it operates below the level of\nConsciousness super interesting and here\nwe're talking about specific changes in\nthe\nbrain terms of neural activity Etc that\noccur during sleep when we've been\nexposed to or engaged in a particular\nnovel for us motor skill and you see\nthis you know these spindles in stage\ntwo Etc but does it work the other way\nas well meaning does the process of\ntrying to learn a new motor skill\nenhance certain components of sleep or\nmaybe even one's ability to sleep you\nknow years ago I heard uh\nthat\npracticing\nunilateral leg movements this is a\nperhaps a crazy idea but but it makes\nsense in the context of what we're\ntalking about practicing unilateral leg\nmovements things like you know\neveryone's familiar with squats and\ndeadlifts and things of that sort but\nthere are some one-legged movements like\na pistol Squad a pistol Squad that's\npretty hard um if one can do them I'm\nalways impressed um Bulgarian split\nsquats you know foot up on the bench and\nthen squatting down with a dumbbell\nthings like that were just unilateral\nmovements that require a lot of mental\nattention to the performance of that\nmovement could be in the gym but it\ncould be something else as well you\nthink about a dancer trying to learn how\nto um organize their their steps um\nwhere they have to pay careful attention\nto right versus Left Foot Right they\nalways say you know like two people have\ntwo right feet that can't people can't\ndance have two right feet or two left\nfeet by the way for those listening\nAndrew is looking at me right now when\nhe's saying two right feet rightfully so\nno I I have no knowledge of your your\ndancing ability or or or challenges\nthereof um as I recall there may have\nbeen some some uh very preliminary data\nabout changes in\nthe amount of certain sleep stages\naccording to whether or not someone had\ntried to learn a skill in this case\nunilateral uh uh\nlimb performance the previous day so in\nother words if one wants to improve\ntheir sleep would the attempt to learn a\nnew motor skill be one Avenue to to\nimprove one's sleep it's it's\ninteresting if you look at some of the\ndata it's a little bit mixed in terms of\nmotor skill learning but there are some\nstudies demonstrating that it's true for\ntextbook like memory and there's a study\ngosh done many years ago Again by the\ngreat German group of yan born and they\nsimply ask the question if you were\nto just not be learning very\ndeliberately and intensively through a\ntextbook like set of information and\nthen we just measure your sleep to get a\nBaseline and then we force you to have a\nvery long very intensive learning\nsession of these facts and then when we\nmeasure your sleep again is there any\ndifference relative to the non-intensive\nlearning day versus the Intensive\nlearning day and indeed what they found\nwas that there was an increase in their\ndeep non-rem sleep in their deep slow\nwave sleep and again we think it's\nalmost we describe it as a homeostatic\nresponse which is just a fancy way of\nsaying that when the brain is driven to\nundergo a demand then sleep will respond\nto try to accommodate that demand and so\nI would say that there are probably many\nother things and we discussed this in\nepisode two in terms of a how to\noptimize your sleep that probably carry\na bigger bang for your buck in terms of\noptimizing and enhancing your sleep but\nis there any evidence to suggest that\nthat's the case there does seem to be\nsome evidence in the literature yeah so\ninteresting I I certainly know the\nexperience of trying to learn a lot of\ninformation and then feeling like my\nsleep is that much deeper although I've\nalso experienced the challenges in quote\nunquote turning my brain off when I've\nbeen trying to learn something and then\nit's late in the evening forget the\ncaffeine component you know just that\nthe the information is spooling in my\nhead maybe some pre uh test anxiety that\nkind of thing so I think the the tools\nand protocols that um you offered so\ngenerously in episodes one two and three\nare especially important under those\nconditions learning how to really taper\noff one's level of of thinking and\nplanning and arousal in the evening\nreally bring things down so that one can\naccess that sleep I mean one only wishes\nthat the more we did during the day the\neasier it would be to sleep I think to\nsome extent that's true but there's a\nthere's some um there's some conditions\nin which doing more thinking about more\nand and I guess that's sort of the the\nirony right I interrupted myself but on\npurpose that wouldn't it be wonderful if\nthe amount and ease of sleep was\ndirectly proport to how much we needed\nto sleep that's that's one of the the\ntricks in this whole business system\nsometimes right like sometimes when we\nreally need sleep we're dealing with\nsomething psychologically challenging or\nwe need to learn something we have an\nexam that often can be when it's most\ndifficult to sleep gets right in the way\nof what we need most although coming\nback to your point I think physical\nactivity does seem to be one of those\nthings that is very good and I'm I I'm\nremiss to have not included it in the\noptimization or the unconventional tips\nthere is a very good robust literature\nnow demonstrating that if you are\nPhysically Active during the day you can\nboost the quality of your sleep\nparticularly your deep sleep at\nnight it seems to be there are some\nsubtle differences in terms of whether\nyou're doing aerobic versus anerobic so\nlet's say versus you know doing a spin\nbike class for an hour versus lifting\nresistance uh or doing resistance\ntraining for an hour or strength\ntraining there's subtle differences but\nnetet overall the big picture of you is\nthat when you perform exercise you drive\na response from enhanced sleep\nparticularly deep sleep at night and I\nthink many people have had that\nexperience you've been out on a long\nhike maybe a 10 12 mile hike or you've\njust been working in the garden doing\nreally you know sort of long Landscaping\nwork throughout the day six or seven\nhours and you just come in and you go to\nbed that night and you you just know\nthat this is going to be the most Royal\nnight of sleep that you could you know\nit ahead of time you know sort of\nearhole to to Elbow um and that evidence\nis now very clear the the one\ninteresting thing if you dig into that\ndata though you can drive increases in\ndeep Sleep by way of exercise it does\nseem to come at a little bit of cost to\nREM sleep exercise May throttle back\nsome of your REM sleep now don't fear\nthat it may just simply be that every\nnight and we know this my sleep and my\nstage stages of sleep are going to be\nmuch different to to yours in how they\nare structured and how they play out but\neven within me the same individual Matt\nmy sleep stages vary from one night to\nthe next to the next some of that is\nidiosyncratic others are or other\nreasons depend on what I've been doing\nduring the day and so it may be that we\ndon't need to get concerned about that\nmodest reduction in rem due to exercise\nenhanced non-rem because it's simply\nthat when you've gone through that form\nof activity as a human being during the\nday what you need is that type of sleep\nmore so than perhaps REM sleep and\ntherefore the next night things\ncalibrate back down let's say I wasn't\nas active I just sort of went to work\ndurly and I'm back to Baseline again so\nI don't get too concerned about that but\nI just want to bring it up it's there in\nthe literature yeah I think it's a very\ninteresting point and one just has to\ntrust that nature Knows Best in\nmodifying the percentage of different\nsleep stages according to our daytime\nactivity again highlighting the the key\nuh relationship I mean the the closely\ntethered relationship between daytime\nactivity and sleeve and vice versa\ncorrect yeah and it's a it's a\nreciprocal Loop because what we found is\nthat exercise during the day can enhance\nsleep at night but also what we found is\nthat sleep at night enhances your\nathletic performance the following day\nand I'm not just talking about motor\nskill memory upstairs in the brain I'm\ntalking about physical activity in the\nbody and if you limit sleep to let's say\nless than 6 hours the data demonstrates\nthat your Peak muscle performance is\ndecreased your Peak vertical jump height\ndecreases your time to exhaustion\ndecreases by in some studies it was up\nto 30% so if you're training for a 10K\nMarathon but you don't get enough sleep\nthe night before you're done by seven we\nalso know that it decreases perhaps more\nthan almost any of those and it's\nstriking the brain's motivation to\nexercise at all so in fact many people\nmay be able to get close to their Peak\nmuscle strength when they are underslept\nchances are they're probably never going\nto get to the chance to express that\nbecause their motivation to exercise\njust drops off and I think many people\nwill resonate that you had a bad night\nof sleep I just don't want to go go to\nthe gym the next day the final part of\nthat is injury risk there is a\nsignificantly elevated injury risk and\nif you ask most athletes okay what am I\nparticularly concerned about is it my\nperformance or if I had some kind of\ninjury that knocks me out for the rest\nof the season and so I've had the\nfortunate chance to work with many\nprofessional teams uh of different kinds\nand gradually they are realizing what\nI've sort of long said and it's a crash\nstatement but I think sleep is probably\nthe greatest legal performance-enhancing\ndrug that most athletes are not abusing\nenough I could not agree more I mean I\nfeel like every time I say sleep is the\nBedrock of mental health physical health\nand performance it\num it's sometimes perceived is just kind\nof like oh yeah sleep we need to sleep\num but there's no question that it the\npositive effects of getting excellent\nsleep on a consistent basis um far out\nway and perform any kind of\nsupplement or even performance enhancing\ndrug in fact those Mo most supplements\nand performance enhancing drugs that can\nindeed improve performance of various\nkinds seem to only function or function\nbest certainly on a backdrop of\nexcellent sleep and I should say that\nyou I think you've done a brilliant job\nof being very explicit about the fact\nthat you need to get all of the basics\nin place and then it's great to think\nabout fine tweaking with optimization of\nthings like supplement ation and all of\nthese other things and I think sometimes\nthat message has been maybe a little bit\nmore mixed in the social media\nenvironment that we often don't think\nabout the basics and we go straight to\nsupplementation where you would say gosh\nthere's actually a log order of\nmagnitude benefit that's on the table if\nonly you to do some of the basic things\nthat your your grandmother would\nprobably tell you you know eat right get\nyour stress sorted out do some physical\nactivity and make sure that you get some\nsleep do those things and you're very\nfar along now there's more opportunity\non the table for fine tuning as as\nyou've elegantly discussed but I think I\njust want to acknowledge that I think\nyou've done a really great job of being\nbalanced in that message um and I hope\npeople um in the general sphere can\nappreciate how hard that is to do it's\nnot an easy thing when you are talking\nabout supplementation because at first\nit sounds as though gosh all of this\nspeak and you describe great data means\nthat it is the Holy Grail\nof enhanced human beings but you're\nalways careful to say this after the\nfoundation and I can give a very good\nexample with sleep let's say that you're\ntrying to manage your weight and lose\nweight and you're dieting but you're not\ngetting sufficient sleep what we've\ndiscovered is that yes you will lose\nweight when you're dieting even though\nyou're not getting enough sleep the\nproblem is that almost 60% of the weight\nthat you lose will come from lean muscle\nmass\nand not fat in other words when you are\nunderslept and dieting you keep what\nyou're trying to lose which is the fat\nand you lose what you wish to keep which\nis the muscle so your body does\nsomething very interesting in its um\nremoval of different types of energy\nstores in your body when you are not\nslept it becomes very stingy with fat\nand it will not give it up when you are\nsleep deprived which is very why would\nthat be by the way muscle such a\nmetabolically demanding tissue you know\nif you're you're send by not sleeping\nwell you're sending signals that there\nreally isn't the capacity to take care\nof what you already have much less uh\nincrease the size of the engine that's\nexactly right and then think about fat\nwhich is in terms of its energy you know\nunit benefit it has you know at least\nperhaps twice the caloric value that\nprotein does so if you are underslept\nthat is a warning sign to any\nevolutionary species past that things\nare dire so whatever I'm going to do\nthis is break glass in case of emergency\nsituation and if you're not getting\nenough calories I'm going to hold on to\nthe thing that has the highest caloric\nvalue right until the end which is fat\nand I'm going to give away the stuff\nthat doesn't have as much caloric\nbenefit because I am in a caloric\ndeficit right now now of course that's\nstrange because the person trying to\nlose weight perhaps is rightfully trying\nto lose weight based on them being\nsomewhat overweight but that's the\nbiology that we think explains why that\nthat's the case it's not just a strange\nphenomenon it's a very logical one yeah\nit is a logical one and and thanks for\nthe um the support around um you know my\nconstant um voicing and revoicing of the\nthe pillars of Health you mention you\nknow exercise SLE well I put it in the\norder of sleep as the the most important\npillar um and then one could argue about\nthe the order of the others but in no\nspecific order um light which dovet\nTales was sleep but um\nnutrition movement exercise uh social\nconnection stress modulation these these\nkinds of things yeah the fact the speed\nwith which that comes out of your mouth\ntells you how many times you've you\nyou've said it and you've said it over\nand over it's wonderful well thank you\nit's it's interesting because they are\nthe basics but um they are Basics that\nneed to be re-up every 24 hours so often\nI feel like we all need to be reminded\nevery 24 hours I also you know one of\nthe most common questions I get is what\nshould I take people like if I had a\ndollar for every time somebody said what\nshould I take you know i' I'd keep\npodcasting but I'd be a gazillionaire um\nbut my response is always the same which\nis how's your sleep the first question I\nsay is how's your sleep and then they\nthink I'm going to suggest a sleep\nsupplement but I want to know whether or\nnot people are sleeping well on a\nconsistent basis and that that opens up\na a whole set of discussions and that um\ninevitably we forget about the what one\nshould take conversation I think it's\nthe rare individual who's sleeping very\nwell every n of their life there are\nsuch individuals and then the the what\nshould I take conversation makes sense\nin a certain context there's something I\nwanted to just uh return to uh for a\nmoment before I move on to the next\ntopic which is you mentioned all the um\nsignificant deficits that occur in Motor\nPerformance when one has not slept that\nwell the night before grip strength a\nvertical jump motivation Etc um you know\nwe're not here to um to deliver anything\nexcept the facts to people we're\ncertainly not here to uh soften the blow\nof reality but there are a good number\nof people that will have say a physical\nperformance like a race they're training\nfor a half marathon or um they have a a\nbig game the next day or um they have\nsome Performance Event the next day and\nby virtue of butterflies um anxiety\ntravel\nan alarm going off in a hotel in the\nmiddle of the night I've had that\nexperience Etc that they may not get the\nbest night sleep the night before and\nand obviously there are going to be\nramifications of that but\num I'm reminded of a study that was done\nby Ali crumbs Lab at Stanford where\nthey people wear sleep\ntrackers and then and they actually knew\nhow much and how well or poorly they s\nslept the night before I don't know how\ndetailed the analysis was but it stford\nsleep center so presumably it was it was\nreasonably detailed and then the next\nday with that knowledge in\nhand either lied to the people or told\nthem the truth about how well they had\nslept the night before or poorly for\ninstance if someone had got eight hours\nof great sleep the night before they\nmight have told them hey you got eight\nhours of great sleep the night before or\nthey might have been in a condition\nwhere they said hey you know what your\nsleep last night wasn't that great yeah\nor if somebody got five hours of sleep\nthey might have said hey you know you\ngot eight hours of great sleep so there\nwas a ly a lot of lying involved in this\nstudy but basically what they observed\nis that\nperformance in I think it was motor\nskill performance but it might have been\ncognitive but the the that's not the the\nissue here the the point is that much of\nour performance can be dependent on our\nsubjective understanding of how well or\npoorly we slept the night before in\nother words there can be belief effects\nthat's right so this one the concerns\nabout placing too too much emphasis on\nthe one poor night sleep you know and\nobviously people should be mindful of\ninjury as you pointed out but if someone\nhas a big race or a big event the next\nday and they just don't sleep well yeah\nI think the that we have to be careful\nthat the mere knowledge that they're not\ngoing to perform as well because that's\nwhat the data say um Can potentially be\noffset by the the Ali crumb study which\nis if they they believe like hey a lot\nof it is about what they believe their\nown sleep to be which just tells you\nthat performance can and motivation\npresumably can override some of the the\nphysiology there a you know and again we\nwe you can't rescue what you can't\nrescue no and I think it's a very good\npoint because it comes back to our\ndiscussion about the placebo effect in\nsome ways which is this is mind over\nmatter and that your biological state so\none of the things I do when I'm working\nwith professional athletes and we're\ndoing sleep tracking of I'm working with\na coach and I will say during that\nperiod where they're really you know\nit's they're on the road and now it's\nthey've got seven games to play in the\nplayoffs let's keep tracking their sleep\nand let's you and I make sure that we're\ntrying to optimize this athlete because\nthey've given consent they want to have\ntheir sleep as good as possible and they\nwant us to help them do that but I say\nat that point we will simply look at the\ndata night after night and then we can\ndescribe the data that they've been\nhaving\nat the end of the week after they\nfinished the\nseries because for exactly that reason\nif you start giving them feedback we\ndon't want to erode confidence and with\nsleep trackers there is such a thing\ncalled\northosomnia and it's now a described\nsituation\northosomnia in medicine words mean\nsomething so although people will be\nfamiliar with in medicine Orthopedics\nOrthodontics it's about getting things\nstraight Orthopedics getting your sort\nof bone straight Orthodontics getting\nyour teeth straight\northosomnia is about trying to get your\nsleep straight and being so worried\nabout that that it compromises your\nsleep now we don't know exactly what\nproportion of people it may be less than\n10% who use sleep trackers but I would\nsay that to anyone listening if you are\ntracking your sleep with a Tracker and\nyou're experiencing this sleep related\nanxiety do one of two things first take\nmy recommend Commendation which is that\nonly on let's say a Sunday afternoon do\nyou open up the app and check your data\nso that way you can still be measuring\nyour sleep which is very helpful but you\ndon't have to get the anxiety morning\nafter morning the other is that if you\nare truly starting to get a very\nnegative experience take it off put it\nin the drawer and just get your sleep\nconfidence back using some of the\nsuggestions that we had in the\noptimization episode and only then\nreturn to using that tracker what's also\ninteresting it relates to what you were\nsaying about beliefs and intention they\ndid another another great study where\nthey looked at this cortisol rise in the\nmorning that you and I have discussed on\nthis series many times which starts to\nhappen sort of just before you're waking\nup and really Rises into the\nmorning what they did was they brought\nparticipants into the laboratory and\nthey had them go to sleep around 11:00\nuh at night and then in one group they\nsaid we're going to wake you up at 7:00\na.m. in the morning\nthe other group they said we're going to\nwake you up at 5 a.m. in the morning\nwell it turns out that both of those\ngroups were woken up at 7 a.m. but what\nwas bizarre is that in the group that\nwas told they were going to wake up at\n5:00 a.m. their cortisol release started\nto rise around 5: a.m. in other words\njust the knowledge before sleep that\nyou're going to be woken up at 5:00 a.m.\nchange the non-conscious brain's release\nof a stock standard prototypical\nhormonal release mechanism and that\ncomes right back to this idea that we we\nwere speaking about with time that\nconsciously we have lost time perception\nwhen we're sleeping but non-consciously\nit seems as though the brain is still\nknowing what's going on because for that\nearly morning flight you wake up 2\nminutes before your alarm well perhaps\nthe reason why is that you're you've\nlearned that you have to wake up at that\ntime and you've changed your cortisol\nresponse which would normally because\nyou don't wake up for an early morning\nflight every day would normally not come\nfor 2 hours but it's arriving earlier it\njust blew me away I couldn't believe\nthat the brain non-consciously could\nchange a hormonal profile simply based\non me telling you what time you're going\nto wake up the next morning spectacular\nand and really as you pointed out really\nspeaks to the fact that during sleep\nthere is a lot of problem processing\ngoing on you know un you subconscious\nunconscious cognitive processing and we\nknow this in the form of Dreams uh a\ntopic that we'll talk about um in a\nsubsequent episode of this series but\nokay so you've shared with us the clear\nvalue of getting the best possible\nnight's sleep before what I call a bout\nof learning y you also shared with us\nthe clear value of getting sleep after\nbeing exposed to some new\ninformation AKA about of learning and\nyou've explained to us the key\nrelationship between sleep and motor\nlearning learning of new motor skills\nwhat are some other aspects of brain and\ncognition for which sleep exerts a\nsignificant positive effect so those for\na while were the first two things that\nwe really thought sleep was doing for\nlearning in memory sleep before learning\nto make those memories sleep after\nlearning to consolidate them and and hit\nthe save button but then data started to\nemerge and we started to look at this\ntoo that sleep was much more intelligent\nthan we ever imagined when it comes to\ninformation processing sleep doesn't\nsimply just strengthen individual\nmemories like isolate Islands\nunconnected sleep after learning is\nalmost a form of informational alchemy\nthat sleep will take these new memories\nand it will start to interconnect them\nand Crosslink them with the new\ninformation that you've learned because\nusually information that you're learning\nduring the day is interconnected and\nsleep was building those connections\nbetween new memories but also it was\nintegrating them into the back catalog\nof all of your past autobiographical\nmemory systems so that you woke up the\nnext day and you had a revised mindwise\nweb of\nassociations and a good example of this\nwe did a study gosh very early on where\nwe asked the question which stage of\nsleep then is important for this type of\nI almost think of it it's probably\nstrange analogy but almost like group\ntherapy for me memories that at the end\nof the day every new memory gets a name\nbadge and sleep gathers in all of these\nmemories into the same room and it\nforces you however to speak to the\npeople not at the front of the room that\nyou think you've got the most obvious\nconnection with it forces you to speak\nto the people all the way at the back of\nthe room that you don't think you've got\nreally any connection with at all but it\nturns out that you do because sleep\ndoesn't simply build associations and\nconnections it does it seems to bias the\nbrain towards building the most\nnon-obvious distant\nassociations it's almost it's almost\nlike a a Google search gone\nwrong that during the waking day our\nmemories which are still our brains are\nstill associative in how they can build\nlinks and connections that's like page\none of the Google search so let's say\nthat I type in you know Andrew hubman\nand I the first page I get the first hit\nis the hubman lab website great but if I\ngo to page 20 it's about a field hockey\ngame in Utah and I think he a second\nwhat's what's Andrew doing you didn't\nknow but yeah I know exactly I don't\nthink I've ever played field hockey I've\nbeen to Utah it's a beautiful state it's\nbeautiful but if I look I can see that\nthere is a very distant non-obvious\nAssociation I can understand why it's\nthere that's what sleep seems to be over\nindexing for in this associational\nframework so then we asked well what is\nit about sleep so we had participants\nperform anagram solving tasks and\nanagrams are simply these words that are\nthe letters are all jumbled up and you\nhave to kind of stare at them or work\nthrough them and all of a sudden you\nstart to see which word it really is\nbecause at first all jumbled up and it\nmakes no sense but we didn't teach them\nit before sleep and after sleep we did\nsomething different we woke them up out\nof different stages of sleep why well\nwhen you come out of different stages of\nsleep you there is still some degree of\nthe biology of that sleep state that\nlingers in your brain almost like Vapors\ncoming off the stage of sleep that\nyou've just exited and it only lasts for\nabout 2 minutes or so but what was nice\nis that that this anagram test you could\ndo within 2 minutes so we would wake\nthem up out of different stages of sleep\nand then we'd have them quickly do these\nanagrams and I told you that for\nfact-based memory that sleep after\nlearning was important to strengthen the\nindividual memories and it it was\nparticularly nonrapid eye movement sleep\nthat was doing that strengthening of the\nindividual facts now what we found is\nthat the association creativity benefit\nof sleep was very different that\ncrosslinking benefit came by way it\nseemed of REM sleep because when we woke\nthem up out of REM sleep compared to\nnon-rem sleep they were 30% more capable\nof solving these\nanagrams and when we looked at how they\nwere solving them it was interesting\ncoming out of non-rm sleep it was very\nsort of analogical it was very what we\nthink of as um very sort of convergent\nvery focused way of trying to logically\nsolve the problem but with REM sleep it\nwas much more Divergent fluid\nintelligence it was almost as though\nthey were just standing back and waiting\nfor it and then it just popped out in\nfront of them all the letters kind of\nreorganized and and clicked into\nplace and then there was a subsequent\nstudy that did something different it\nlooked specifically at creative\ninsight and it was a lovely study and\nthey performed something called the\nnumeric number reduction test which is\none of those test that psychologists\nlove to administer and participants hate\nto perform and here's what happens\nyou're shown a whole string of numbers\nand you are given a certain set of rules\nand you have to work through those\nnumber problems and come out with a\nfinal end answer and you're told that\nyou're going to be judged simply on how\nmany correct Final End answers that you\nget and you work through hundreds of\nthese\nproblems what they don't tell you in the\ninstructions however is that there is a\nhidden rule here\nembedded in that all of those sequences\nall of the sequences are different that\nyou have to solve but there is one\ncommon rule that binds them all together\nwhich is that the second part sort of\nthe second component of the solution so\nyou're working through let's say it's a\n10 digigit string number and you have to\napply these rules to the first number\nthen carry it through to the second\nnumber and then to the third number and\nthe the second partial number that you\nproduce in this string of calculations\nto get to the Final End answer it turns\nout to be always the same end answer so\nin other words if you clue on to this\nhidden rule all you have to do is work\nup to the first let's say 10% of every\nproblem you can just shortcut the rest\nof it and you just write down the number\nbecause you are told that the only thing\nwe're going to judge you on is the end\nanswer so they train participants on\nthese sort of numeric number reduction\nuh trials and then they brought them\nback after 12 hours of being awake and\nno one seemed to have that light bulb\nmoment of the sort of okay I get it but\nthen they did the same thing they\ntrained them but now they trained them\nin the evening they get gave them a\nfull8 hours of sleep came back the next\nmorning and there was a threefold\nincrease in Creative Insight problem\nsolving ability in other words people\nwere coming back with that aha moment of\nyou know the gig is up I've got it I\nknow what you guys are trying to do and\nI'm going to show\nyou then they did something clever they\nsaid back to question of motor skill\nlearning well is that really sleep or is\nit just Cadian that it's just something\nabout going through the night that gives\nyou this kind of Dale creative benefit\nso they took another group they taught\nthem the information in the evening and\nthey tested them the next morning just\nlike the Sleep group but they kept them\nup all night so they went through\nnighttime n for that time period and\nthey showed no benefit in the problem\nsolving and my experience is that sleep\ndeprivation leads to all sorts of ideas\nabout how one um is coming up with novel\nideas and solutions all of which\ncompletely suck after two good night\nsleep um but but most of the time it\nseems that sleep deprivation\nintoxication of any kind um it it gives\none the impression that you know you're\ncoming up with novel Solutions but\nreally they're just novel that D is very\nclear that you know there was this Moma\nthat if if I sort of go through the\nnight and work sort of through into the\nmorning I'm just much more creative when\nI'm sleep deprived and and it's been\ntested and it's just it's the opposite\nquite the opposite in fact what I I also\nfind interesting though about this the\nsleep and creativity log it was always\nthere in the literature that there are\ninnumerable anecdotes of people having\nsleep inspired Insight it's almost as\nthough when you wake up the next morning\nhaving had that revised set of web\nConnections in your brain you can divine\nsolutions to previously impenetrable\nproblems and there's a great example I\nthink Dimitri Mev um who at the time was\ntrying to answer one of the most epic\nquestions in human history how do all of\nthe known elements in the universe fit\ntogether in some logical order and he\nwas failing he just could not and he was\nso obsessed with this problem he created\nplaying cards with all of the different\nelements of the universe and their\natomic weights and their electron and he\nwould go on these long train rides and\nhe would just Shuffle the cards and he\nwould deal the cards on the table he was\njust desperate to try to see what the\npattern was he was shuffling and\nshuffling and shuffling and then the\nstory goes and it's written that one\nnight he fell asleep and he dreamed and\nhe could start to see all of the cards\njust dancing around in front of his eyes\nand then they snap together in this\nlogical grid based on the atomic weight\nand the different electron properties\nand he wrote it down on the back of an\nenvelope which still exists to this date\nreally yeah and you can see it out and\nthat was the initial basis for what we\ncall the periodic table of elements\namazing and it revolutionized human\nhistory and it's not just in science I\nmean there's great scientific you know\npeople have won Nobel prizes for\nunderstanding neural transmission uto ly\nwell and maybe it's worth um rattling\noff a few brief examples because they're\nthey're so spectacular Einstein was\nknown for taking naps in the middle of\nthe day multiple times throughout the\nday in order to come up with novel\nSolutions um I think the the discovery\nof the um some of the organic you know\nring the Benzene ring was uh came to uh\nI'm\nforgetting in a dream thank you um there\nare numerous examples of fundamental\nscientific\ndiscoveries that is creative insights\nthat were anchored to real world\nexperiments um and Theory pure Theory as\nwell that came to people in their dreams\nso what's interesting though is that\nthere seems to be some sort of hydraulic\npressure created by the the the waking\nor within wakefulness attempt to like\nfigure something out so all of these\npeople um to be very clear didn't didn't\njust sleep to come up with solutions\nthey put a lot of kind of hydraulic\npressure feeding a lot of information\nyou thinking about a problem in a in a\nstructured or unstructured way taking\nwalks focusing on their other demands of\nthe day but then when they went to sleep\nclearly that information was still being\nworked with in in in important ways and\nthen you going to mention some examples\nuh from uh the Arts I think yeah there's\nsome great you know I'm um I was born\nand raised in uh Liverpool uh in England\nand of course famous for the Beatles and\nfor Liverpool Football Club uh and event\nas well that I'm a Lial supporter\nhowever Paul McCartney has gone on\nrecord very clearly to say that two\nsongs that were probably some of the the\nthe most successful songs yesterday and\nlet it be both came to him by way of\ndream inspired Insight there's a lovely\ndescription I think in his biography he\nwas filming it was either help or a hard\ndays night down in London with the rest\nof the Beatles And he was staying in a\nrental in wimpole street in London and\nhe was staying on the third floor and in\nhis bedroom fortunately there was a\npiano on the opposite side of the room\nand he describes how he woke up one\nmorning with this beautiful Melody by\nway of um it was a string quartet that\nwas playing it and it was the melody for\num yesterday and he went straight over\nto the piano and he started playing it\nand he said it was just so Sumptuous and\nhe couldn't remember where he had heard\nit and then after a while he remembered\nI haven't heard it anywhere before it\ncame to me by way of sleep same thing\nwith um Let It Be the the obviously you\nknow Mother Mary comes to me singing\nsongs singing words of wisdom let it be\nand there's often been a suggestion that\nthat has religious overtones um in terms\nof mother Mary it actually is not um\nit's his mother Mary\nMcCarney and was having a hard time\nstruggling with the fame of The Beatles\nat that moment and one night he slept\nand his mother Mary came to him and just\nsaid Relax it's going to be okay stay\ntrue to yourself continue doing what\nyou're doing just let it be and he woke\nup and he wrote the song I love that\nstory um and there's some actionable\ntakeaways here that um if if I may I I\njust wanted to um mention um a previous\nguest on this episode in fact he's been\non the the podcast twice is the the\ngreat Rick Rubin oh I've listened to\nthose yeah one of one of the most\nlegendary music producers of all time\nand and the second episode that we did\nwith Rick gets heavily into some of his\nprotocols for lack of a better way to\ndescribe them and one of the things that\nRick does is when he wakes up in the\nmorning he makes it a point to he takes\nwalks he gets Sunshine he hydrates he\ndoes all of those things but to try and\nmake the transition between sleep and\nwakefulness to be rather gradual almost\nto allow some of the the components of\nsleep to um kind of bleed into the\nmorning and then allow wakefulness to to\ncome about um and in his case he's able\nto push some of the more uh linear\nprocessing and procedural things to\nlater in the day um and I've spent a lot\nof time with Rick I'm fortunate to be\nclose friends with Rick and and I can\ntell you that he also spends a fair\namount of time you know sitting or lying\ndown typically very still with his eyes\nclosed just thinking or allowing\nthoughts to emerge as part of um his\ncreative process now he's certainly not\nthe only one to do this um but he's he's\na notable example but what's the\ntakeaway here should everyone be you\nknow lying with their eyes closed um\nwhen they first wake up perhaps but\nthere's a some potential dos but I think\nthere's a really strong don't if one\nsubscribes to the idea that during sleep\nthere is substantial reorganization of\nneural circuitry AKA learning but also\nexpansion of creative opportunity as\nyou've clearly pointed out and there are\ndata to support that statement then it\nstands to reason that upon waking\nthere's a key opportunity to capture\nsome of\nthat information that is now in your\nmind um that was created the night\nbefore but that if you immediately look\nat your phone that you Eclipse that\nprocess with sensory input from somebody\nelse's ideas and what's going on in the\nworld and it's not to say that looking\nyour phone first thing in the morning is\na is a is a cardinal sin or a violation\nof any kind of neural neural circuit\nrequirement but I in an attempt to try\nand capture some of the learning and\ncreativity that occurs during sleep have\ntried for a while now to not look at my\nphone for at least the first 30 minutes\nafter waking it's very challenging to do\nfor for most everybody but rather to let\nsome of the ideas um from sleep\npercolate up and I will often go you\nknow be you know making a morning of tea\nor something and then go running to my\noffice to write something down that\nsuddenly Springs to mind and then I'll\nremember that this was something that\ncame to me in a dream the night before\nnone of which as significant as the\nBenzene ring or the periodic table or\nthe kind of works that uh Rick has\nproduced but I think that we need to be\ncautious about um not short circuiting\nthese um these creative insights that no\ndoubt can come to us and sleep I think\nit's very well worth just even for your\nown mental health firstly not to just\nwake up up and start your reception of\nthe world but to do some as we've\nmentioned reflection on what you've just\nexperienced by way of sleeping and it\ndoesn't necessarily have to be that\nyou're trying to recall your dreams just\nsit with whatever your thoughts are\nthink about the the day ahead think\nabout the days prior and there is some\nbenefit and the creative benefit there\nyou mentioned Einstein another one that\nis often mentioned to me is Edison uh\nThomas Edison the in ventor and Edison\nwas claimed to be a short sleeper people\nwill say well he was a brilliant\ninventor but you know he said that he\ndidn't sleep very much it turns out that\nEdison was a habitual Napper during the\nday and I've got lots of pictures of him\nhim napping on his workbench um in his\nStudio him napping in the garden I love\nit well I took a 45 minute nap today\nyeah and it was he and I'm no Edison but\nI subscribed to his protocols um but you\nknow he he understood the creative\nBrilliance of sleep to your point about\nwriting things down and he used it\nruthlessly as a tool and here's what he\nwould do it's genius he would take a\npair of Steel bull bearings in his right\nhand he would sit in his office on a\nreclining chair with a rest for his arm\nand then he would put a pad of paper and\na pen next to him and then he would\ngradually start to relax off but what\nhe' done was he' used a metal saucein\nand turned it upside down and placed it\nunderneath the armrest and as he was\ndrifting off into that state into that\nsort of lional state so he didn't go too\nfar into sleep what would happen is that\nhis muscle tone would gradually relax he\nwould release the steel ball bearings\nthey would crash on the saucepan wake\nhim up and then he would start to write\ndown all of the ideas that he was having\nfrom that linal state oh you said\nsaucepan saucepan sorry that's why no no\nthat's okay but uh very so what made a\nit made a a a metal sauce underneath you\nknow or a water pale whatever it was and\nit would crash that wake him up and then\nhe would write down these ideas\ninteresting and in fact if you look at\nhis house which is preserved um\nhistorical you can walk around and he\nhad nap Cuts installed in his house so\nhe could go into different rooms and\ntake naps in these little cuts for his\ngenius brilliant isn't it it is\nbrilliant sorry I didn't mean to\ninterrupt but it was out of enthusiasm I\nI mean I I don't want to um like give\ntoo much detailed information about\nRick's working environment but yet let's\njust say there are a lot of places to\nlie down and access these these states\nof mind um and you know it looks like\nsomebody just lying there with their\neyes closed but there's an extremely\nactive mind in there obviously look at\nthe look at the um productive output of\nRick's career is you know it's truly\nsomething to behold behold in capital\nbold underline highlighted letters um\nbut it's so clear to me um based on all\nthe examples you gave the ones that\nwe're kind of batting back and forth now\nand I think there's a book the title is\nsomething like Winston Churchill's nap\nor something like that that my dad has\nalways talking my dad's a theoretical\nphysicist always talks about napping is\nso key um to one's ability to come up\nwith novel Solutions um you know I guess\nuh that napping frequently throughout\nthe day perhaps violates some of the\ntenants that you um described in the\nuh episode on napping and caffeine\nepisode three we put I think you we put\nin guard rails and we put in the\nprotocols to say okay naps under certain\ncircumstances are no bad thing at all\nand if you're going to do it here are\nthe suggested guidelines as to exactly\nhow you optimize naps with a protocol um\nbut it is I think it's very worthwhile\nto just appreciate exactly how complex\nsleep is in terms of what it's doing for\ninformation processing and if you to ask\nme look what's the the take-home of this\nfinal\nsection I think it's no one has ever\ntold you Andrew you really need to stay\nawake on a\nproblem they've told you that you should\nsleep now many times on a problem go to\nsleep yeah sleep on a problem and what's\ninteresting is that in every language\nthat I've inquired about today from you\nknow English to Swahili that phrase\nsleeping on a problem or something like\nit\nvery much exist I think the Spanish\nsomeone was telling me is translated is\nyou have a conversation with your pillow\nwhich I thought was lovely what I also\nwas struck by a fellow who was um French\nsaid you in in England you say you you\nsleep on a problem well the French\ntranslation is much closer to you sleep\nwith a problem and I thought that's much\nso much about the Romantic difference\nbetween the beautiful French and the the\nEng you know you sleep on a problem ver\nas you sleep with a problem yes I agree\nI I think um not only does it have more\nromantic Notions but but I like it\nbecause it there's a a um a symbiotic\naspect to you know sleeping with the\nproblem there's kind of a meshing with\nthe challenge in a way that um isn't as\nuh combative like this thing that's\nWeighing on you you go to sleep with and\nyou're supposed to wake up and and feel\nlike you've solved it like Eureka right\npush down on it rather than it's\nelaboration with sleep rather than a\ndemand from it but I also think it's you\nknow I make that notion about language\ntranslation and maybe a slight joke but\nwhat it also tells me is this that that\nphenomenon of sleep dependent creativity\ntranscends cultural boundaries it is\ncommon across the globe it's a universal\nphenomenon why well because sleep is a\nuniversal phenomenon not just even in\nhumans but in almost every species that\nwe've studied carefully to\ndat as you uh described the um the the\nFrench notion of sleeping with a problem\nI think um what the that comes to mind\nis that perhaps the the idea is um if\nyou're going to sleep with a problem\nthat um you should be the big spoon and\nthey should be the little spoon as\nopposed as opposed to the problem being\nthe big spoon and you're kind of wrapped\nin the problem maybe the the problem\nneeds to mesh with you but maybe I'm\ntaking this this IM a little too far\nbefore we close out this discussion\nabout sleep and creativity I can't help\nbut bring up um a set of questions\naround a different\nnonsleep protocol that in many ways\nseems to mimic sleep and that for some\nindividuals throughout history in\nparticular the great physicist Richard\nFineman um another habitual Napper yeah\nand an absolute Idol of mine uh wrote\nabout and spoke about his fondness for\num these flotation tanks that are\ncontain a temperature of water that is\num fairly neutral so one doesn't\nrecognize um the difference between body\ntemperature and the surrounding water\nand there's a certain amount of of salt\nsalinity in the water that allows one to\nfloat at a at a um kind of a depth\nwithin the water that one loses their\nsense of proprioceptive awareness as you\ndescribed earlier in in this series a\nkey component of falling asleep and he\ntalked about how under those conditions\nin the flotation tank there was a um\nkind of an untethering of the of one's\nNotions of space and time that were very\nsleep-like and that that was one of his\num go-to for Creative Solutions um\npeople talked about walks um as a go-to\nfor Creative Solutions in the shower\npeople seem to come up with Creative\nSolutions states of Mind where that\nthey're um an activi is where it's only\nsomewhat goal directed but basically the\nidea is to just lose track of one's body\npositioning and let the mind go so to\nspeak and for that matter psychedelics\nare um have on occasion been um\nattributed as at least one of the\nsources of Creative Solutions um I\nraised these ideas understanding that\neach one of those could be a podcast\ninto itself but it seems to me that\nsleep\nand in particular dream sleep is\nNature's Way of creating these um you\nknow these states of untethering our our\nour rigid linear understanding of what\nrelates to what and it provides this\nthis you know near magical mixing of of\nthings learned the day before and um and\nthat's the essence of creativity and\nhumans have been trying to tap into the\ncreative process through all these other\nportals for a long time with expensive\nTechnologies and um but it it it's\nbecoming very clear to me that the\ntechnology already exists and that it\ncosts absolutely nothing and that it has\ntremendous health benefits uh uh in\naddition to its benefits for creativity\nand that that uh technology is this This\nbrilliant technology of of sleep yeah\nand dreaming it's a stunning State Matt\nthank you so much for today's discussion\nabout sleep memory learning and\ncreativity um we are now four episodes\ninto this series on sleep uh first\nepisode we discussed rather you taught\nus about sleep and the biology of sleep\nas well as some actionable um takeaways\nso actually some I would say some uh\nimportant guidelines for getting one\nsleep correct and then in this second\nepisode you went much further into\nprotocols both basic Advanced for\ngetting one sleep right maybe even\noptimized and the third episode you\ntaught us about naps and caffeine and\ntoday you've taken us on a beautiful\nexploration of the relationship between\nsleep and learning are what's more\ninteresting than neuroplasticity and\nlearning I mean after all um you know\nhumans are unique in our ability to\nlearn so many things throughout the\nlifespan it's one of the things that\ndistinguishes us from the other species\non the planet the the the very very long\nwindow perhaps lifelong window for the\nopportunity to learn and of course\ncreativity and novel solutions to\nchallenging problems in the world but\nalso great works of art and music Etc I\nthink we can fairly say based on what\nyou've taught us today that sleep has\nbeen not only the Bedrock of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nsince the beginning of time and still\nnow but also has been one of the\nfundamental drivers of human evolution\nbecause of all the creative insights\nthat have OCC occurred and all the\nlearning that's occurred in sleep that's\nthen been transformed into real world\nTechnologies indeed it's much of the way\nthat we have the the blessing of being\nright here right now if that's the flag\nthat you're raising I will salute it uh\nfive we still Tuesday very much yes well\nI'll salute that flag right with you and\nalso point to the exciting fact that the\nnext episode episode five in this series\nyou're going to teach us about the\nreally tight relationship between sleep\nand emotional processing and\nemotionality and I can't think of a more\ninteresting topic to get into especially\nat this point in the series and I look\nforward to that discussion with\nemotional enthusiasm I can't wait if\nfolks are interested in trying to\nmodulate their mental health um I think\nthat next discussion should be very\nhelpful with regard to sleep I
