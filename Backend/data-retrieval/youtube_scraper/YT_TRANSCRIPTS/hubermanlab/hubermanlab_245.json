    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n(energetic music)\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday's podcast episode\nis all about sleep,\nand we're also going to talk about\nthe mirror image of sleep,\nwhich is wakefulness.\nNow, these two phases of our life,\nsleep and wakefulness,\ngovern everything about our\nmental and physical health,\nand we're not just gonna talk about\nwhat's useful about sleep,\nwe're also gonna talk about\nhow to get better at sleeping,\nand that will include how to\nget better at falling asleep,\ntiming your sleep, and\naccessing better sleep quality.\nIn doing so, we're also gonna discuss\nhow to get more focused\nand alert in wakefulness,\nso because sleep and\nwakefulness are related,\nwe really can't have a\nconversation about one\nwithout the other.\nNow, in keeping with this theme,\nyou may catch a few\nsnores in the background.\nUnlike me, my bulldog, Costello,\ncan fall asleep anywhere, anytime,\nand he happens to be sleeping\nover there in the corner,\nso if you hear snoring,\nthat's what that's about.\nAs always, I wanna just\nmention that this podcast\nis part of my effort to bring\nzero-cost-to-consumer public education\nabout science and science-related tools,\nit is unrelated to my\nteaching and research roles\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday's podcast is brought\nto us by Helix mattresses,\nhaving the proper sleep environment,\nboth the environment you're sleeping in\nand the object you're sleeping on,\nis critically important to\ngetting a good night's sleep.\nHelix mattresses are a\nlittle different than most\nbecause they're matched to\nyour specific sleep needs,\nas well as whether or not\nyou tend to run hot or cold\nas you sleep through the night,\nwhat position you sleep in, and so forth,\nso if you go to their website,\nthey have a quiz that you can take\nthat matches you to\nthe particular mattress\nthat's gonna be best for your sleep needs.\nI've always had a lot of trouble sleeping,\nI'm one of these people\nthat can fall asleep easily,\nbut then I wake up\nand I have a hard time\ngetting back to sleep,\nand once I switched to a Helix mattress\nthat was precisely\nmatched to my sleep needs,\nI found I could sleep through the night,\nwhich has made a tremendous\ndifference for me.\nIf you wanna try Helix mattresses,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\nand that will give you up to\n$200 off on a mattress order,\nas well as two pillows free\nwith your mattress order,\nand of course, having the proper pillows\nis just as important as\nhaving the proper mattress.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by Headspace,\nHeadspace is a meditation app\nthat teaches you how to meditate.\nIt's fair to say that now there's\na ton of research out there\nin peer-reviewed journals\nsupporting the fact that\nmindfulness meditation\ncan support mental and physical health,\nbut many people find it hard to meditate,\nin fact, I'm one of these people.\nI started meditating in my teens,\nbut then I would drop\nit every few weeks or so\nand then I'd get back to it\nmaybe the following week or every year,\nI just was not very regular\nabout my meditation practice,\nand then a few years ago I\nwas flying a lot for work\nand I was on JetBlue flights,\nand they have Headspace as\npart of the choice of things\nthat you can watch on the TV screen,\nand as I started\nmeditating more regularly,\nwhat I found is my sleep was better,\nI would arrive feeling more rested,\nit was just a tremendous effects\non my work performance and\nother aspects of my life.\nIf you wanna try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,\nif you do that, you'll get one month\nof all of Headspace's\nmeditations for free,\nthat's the best offer right now,\nso if interested, go to\nheadspace.com/specialoffer.\nSo let's talk about sleep,\nsleep is this incredible\nperiod of our lives\nwhere we are not conscious.\nWe might dream, we might\ntwitch, we might even wake up,\nbut in sleep, we are only in relation\nto things that are happening\nwithin our brain and body.\nOutside sensory experience, in most cases,\ncan't really impact us,\nand yet, sleep is this tremendously\nimportant period of life\nbecause it resets our ability\nto be focused, alert,\nand emotionally stable\nin the wakeful period,\nso we can't really talk\nabout wakefulness, focus,\nmotivation, mood, wellbeing\nwithout thinking about sleep,\nand that's why we're\ndevoting this entire month\nto the discussion about sleep.\nNow, we also can't talk about\nsleep and think about sleep\nwithout thinking about wakefulness\nbecause it turns out that\nthe period that we call sleep\nand the period we call wakefulness\nare tethered to one another.\nWhat we do in the waking state\ndetermines when we fall asleep,\nhow quickly we fall asleep,\nwhether or not we stay asleep,\nand how we feel when we\nwake up the next day,\nand today, we're going to talk mostly\nabout how to get better at sleeping,\nand the reason for starting\nthe conversation that way\nas opposed to just diving into\na lot of biology about sleep,\nis because first of all,\nthere's a lot of information\nout there already\nabout the biology of sleep.\nWe're gonna touch on a little bit of this,\nthings like stages of\nsleep and sleep spindles,\nmelatonin, and dreaming,\nbut I think that by now,\nmost people are aware\nthat getting a really good night's sleep\non a consistent basis\nis critically important,\nbut most people don't know how to do that.\nIn fact, I'm guessing that\nvery few of you out there\nare consistently getting\nseven to nine hours\nof really terrific sleep,\nwaking up feeling rested\nand like you're ready to attack the day,\nand being able to go through the day\nfeeling focused and alert\nwithout dips in energy or focus,\nso if you're like most\npeople, which includes me,\nyou have some challenges with sleep\nat least every third or fifth night or so\nand maybe even more often,\nso we're really gonna go tool-heavy today\nand talk about tools that\ncan help you fall asleep,\nsleep better, and emerge from\nsleep feeling more rested,\nand we're gonna do that by\ngrounding our discussion of tools\nin peer-reviewed studies,\nmostly from the last 10 years,\nalthough some even more recent than that,\nand we're gonna start by\ndiscussing what is sleep\nand what governs the timing\nof the onset of sleep,\nin other words, what makes you get sleepy\nat a particular time of day.\nSo what determines how well we sleep\nand the quality of our wakeful state?\nTurns out that's governed by two forces,\nthe first force is a chemical force,\nit's called adenosine.\nAdenosine is a molecule in\nour nervous system and body\nthat builds up the longer we are awake,\nso if you've just slept for 8, or 9,\nor 10 really deep, restful hours,\nadenosine is gonna be very\nlow in your brain and body.\nIf, however, you've been awake\nfor 10, 15, or more hours,\nadenosine levels are\ngoing to be much higher.\nAdenosine creates a sort of\nsleep drive or a sleep hunger,\nand actually, hunger is\nthe appropriate word here\nbecause for most of what\nwe're gonna discuss today,\nwe can think of it in an\nanalogous way to nutrition.\nYour nutrition and how well you feel\nafter you eat certain foods,\nyour overall level of fitness\nand your cellular health\nand your heart health\nisn't governed by any one food item\nthat you might eat or not eat,\nit's governed by a number\nof different factors,\nhow often you eat, how much you eat,\nwhich items you eat, et cetera,\nand what works best for you.\nIn the same way, your\nsleep and your wakefulness\nare the product of kind of the average\nof a number of different behaviors,\nhow long you've been awake is a key one\nbecause of this molecule, adenosine.\nSo the reason you get sleepy\nwhen you've been up for a while\nis because adenosine\nis creeping up steadily\nthe longer you've been awake,\nand a good way to remember\nthis and think about adenosine\nis to think about caffeine.\nCaffeine, for most people,\nexcept a very small percentage of people,\nwakes them up, it makes\nthem feel more alert,\nin fact, some people are\nso sensitive to caffeine\nthat they feel jittery if they drink it\neven in small amounts,\nother people can drink\nlarge amounts of caffeine\nand not feel jittery at all.\nCaffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist,\nwhat that means is that\nwhen you ingest caffeine,\nwhether or not it's coffee or soda or tea,\nor in any other form,\nit binds to the adenosine receptor,\nit sort of parks there just like a car\nwould park in a given parking slot,\nand therefore, adenosine\ncan't park in that slot.\nNow, when caffeine parks in\nthe adenosine receptor slot,\nnothing really happens\ndownstream of that receptor,\nthe receptor can't engage\nthe normal cellular\nfunctions of making that cell\nand you feel sleepy.\nSo the reason caffeine wakes you up\nis because it blocks\nthe sleepiness receptor,\nit blocks the sleepy signal,\nand this is why when\nthat caffeine wears off,\nadenosine will bind to that receptor,\nsometimes with even greater,\nwhat we call affinity,\nand you feel the crash,\nyou feel especially tired.\nNow, I'm not here to demonize\ncaffeine, I love caffeine,\nand I drink it in the morning\nand I drink it in the afternoon,\nbut I'm one of these people\nthat, either because of my tolerance\nor because of some genetic variations\nthat exist among people\nin terms of their adenosine receptors,\nI can drink caffeine\nas late as 4:00 or 5:00\np.m. in the evening\nand still fall asleep just fine.\nSome people can't have any caffeine at all\nor can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m.\nor else their sleep is totally disrupted.\nAll of this has to do\nwith the relationship\nbetween adenosine and\nthese adenosine receptors,\ngenetic variation,\nthings that are very hard to\nfind out except experimentally,\nmeaning each of you needs to decide\nand figure out for yourselves\nwhether or not you can tolerate caffeine\nand at what times of day\nyou can tolerate caffeine\nin order to still fall asleep\neasily and get good sleep,\nso rather than demonize caffeine,\nor say that everyone can\ndrink caffeine until late,\nyou need to figure out\nwhat's right for you.\nCaffeine has a lot of health benefits,\nit also, for some people,\ncan be problematic for health,\nit can raise blood pressure, et cetera,\ncaffeine increases this molecule\nthat's a neuromodulator\nthat we call dopamine,\nwe discussed this in episode one,\nwhich tends to make us\nfeel good, motivated,\nand give us energy\nbecause, as you may have\nlearned in episode one,\ndopamine is related to\nanother neuromodulator\ncalled epinephrine, which gives us energy,\nin fact, epinephrine\nis made from dopamine.\nSo let's just take a step back\nand think about what we're talking about\nwhen we're talking about sleepiness,\nsleepiness is driven by\nincreases in adenosine\nthat happen naturally,\ncaffeine prevents the adenosine\nfrom having its action of making us sleepy\nby blocking that receptor,\nso it gives us energy and it\nincreases our dopamine levels,\nbut some people can't\ntolerate caffeine very well,\nother people can tolerate it just fine,\nso you need to determine\nthat experimentally.\nAll the data say there's\ntremendous variation,\nand right now, the only\nway that I'm aware of\nfor you to decide whether or not\ncaffeine is a good or a bad thing for you,\nand whether or not you should ingest it\nat a given time of day or at all\nis really to figure that out on your own,\nin fact, there's a small subset of people\nthat can drink caffeine until very late\nand they have no trouble falling asleep\nbecause they actually have a mutant form\nof the adenosine receptor,\nso in keeping with the theme\nof science and science-related tools,\nthis is one of those cases\nwhere I can't give you a\none-size-fits-all prescription\nexcept to say you need to\nexperiment with caffeine\nin a way that's safe for you\nand explore that and figure\nout what works for you,\nand then stick with that.\nOkay, so adenosine is\ndriving this sleep hunger,\nwhen adenosine is low,\nit's like we're well-fed,\nwe're not very hungry,\nand when adenosine is high,\nit's like we're fasted for a long time\nand we tend to be very hungry,\nso that when adenosine is high,\nwe really wanna fall asleep.\nIf you want, I'm not suggesting\nyou do this experiment,\nbut you can do it,\nyou can stay up for four more hours\nthan you're used to staying up\nand you'll find that\nyou're very, very sleepy.\nThat's because adenosine is building up\nat levels higher and higher\nbecause you've been awake\nfor those extra four hours.\nHowever, if you've ever\npulled an all-nighter,\nyou'll notice something interesting,\nas morning rolls around,\nyou'll suddenly feel an increase\nin your energy and alertness again,\neven though adenosine has been building up\nfor the entire night.\nNow, why is that?\nThe reason that is is because\nthere's a second force\nwhich is governing when you\nsleep and when you're awake,\nand that force is a\nso-called circadian force,\ncircadian means about a\nday or about 24 hours,\nand inside all of us is a clock\nthat exists in your brain and my brain,\nand the brain of every\nanimal that we're aware of,\nthat determines when we want to be sleepy\nand when we want to be awake.\nJust think about it,\nwe don't go through the day\nwanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes\nand then feeling like we're wide awake,\nour sleep and our period of sleepiness\ntends to be condensed into one block,\ntypically one 6- to 10-hour block,\nalthough there's also variation\nin terms of how much people want to sleep,\nand we're going to discuss\nhow you can diagnose\nyour absolute sleep need\nas well as how to recover\nsleep that you've lost.\nThat block of sleep\nand when it falls within\neach 24-hour cycle\nis governed by a number\nof different things,\nbut the most powerful thing\nthat's governing when\nyou want to be asleep\nand when you want to be awake is light,\nand in particular, it's\ngoverned by sunlight,\nand I can't emphasize enough\nhow important and how\nactionable this relationship is\nbetween light and when you want to sleep.\nIt's quite simple on the face of it\nand it's quite simple to resolve,\nbut people tend to make a big mess\nof this whole circadian\nliterature, frankly,\nso let's just break it\ndown from the standpoint\nof what's going on in your brain and body\nas you go through one 24-hour day.\nLet's start with waking,\nso regardless of how\nwell you slept at night\nor whether or not you were up all night,\nmost people tend to wake up\nsometime around when the sun rises,\nmaybe not right at sunrise,\nbut within an hour or two\nor maybe three of sunrise.\nNow, I realize there\nare night-shift workers\nand there are people traveling\nand experiencing jet lag\nwhere this is not going to be the case,\nwe are gonna deal with\njet lag and shift work\nat the end of this podcast,\nbut for most people, we tend to wake up\nabout the time that the\nsun is rising or so,\nand as we do that,\nadenosine levels tend to\nbe low if we've been asleep\nfor reasons that you now understand,\nand our system generates\nan internal signal\nthat is in the form of a hormone.\nNow, I've talked a lot about\nneuromodulators and neurotransmitters,\nI haven't talked a lot about\nhormones yet on this podcast.\nThe definition of a hormone\nis it's a substance,\na chemical that's released\nfrom one organ in your body\nthat goes and acts on other\norgans elsewhere in your body,\nincluding your nervous system.\nWhen you wake up in the morning,\nyou wake up because a particular\nhormone called cortisol\nis released from your adrenal glands,\nyour adrenal glands sit\nright above your kidneys,\nand there's a little pulse of cortisol.\nThere's also a pulse of some,\nand when I say a pulse,\nI just mean the release of a little bit,\nthere's also a pulse of\nepinephrine, which is adrenaline,\nfrom your adrenals and also in your brain,\nand you feel awake.\nNow, that pulse of cortisol\nand adrenaline and epinephrine\nmight come from your alarm clock,\nit might come from you\nnaturally waking up,\nbut it tends to alert your\nwhole system in your body\nthat it's time to\nincrease your heart rate,\nit's time to start tensing your muscles,\nit's time to start moving about.\nIt's very important\nthat that cortisol pulse\ncome early in the day,\nor at least, early in your\nperiod of wakefulness,\nI say that because some people\nare waking up at 8:00 p.m.\nand are sleeping all day,\nbut it's very important\nthat that pulse of cortisol\noccur early in the day and\nthat it happens all at once,\nit sort of sets a rising tide\nof cortisol in your system.\nNow, many of you have\nprobably heard about cortisol\nin relation to stress,\nand indeed, as we go through\nour day and our life,\ndifferent stressors, different\nevents happen in our life\nthat make us feel more alert.\nSome of the more stressful ones\nmight be looking at your credit card bill\nand seeing what seems to\nbe a fraudulent charge,\nor looking at your phone\nand suddenly seeing a text that something\nyou thought was gonna\nhappen at a particular time\nis not gonna happen,\nor you're running late,\nthose will tend to increase norepinephrine\nand epinephrine and\nadrenaline in your system,\nand if they're severe enough,\nyou'll start getting\nsome pulses of cortisol\nreleased from your adrenals\nthroughout the day,\nbut there's this normal,\nhealthy rising tide of cortisol\nthat happens early in the day,\nand I say healthy because it wakes you up,\nit makes you feel alert,\nand it makes you feel able\nto move and wanting to move\nand to go about your day\nfor work, for exercise,\nfor school, for social\nrelations, et cetera.\nSo when you wake up in the morning\nis when that cortisol pulse takes off,\nand something else important happens,\na timer is set in your body\nand in your nervous system\nthat dictates when a different\nhormone called melatonin,\nwhich makes you sleepy,\nwill be secreted from a\nparticular brain region,\nso let's talk about that.\nWhen you wake up in the morning\nand you experience that rise in cortisol,\nthere's a timer that starts going,\nand these are cellular timers\nand they're dictated by the relation\nbetween different organs in your body,\nthat says to your brain and body\nthat in about 12 to 14 hours,\na different hormone, this\nhormone we're calling melatonin,\nwill be released from your pineal gland.\nSo there's two mechanisms here,\na wakefulness signal\nand a sleepiness signal,\nand the wakefulness signal\ntriggers the onset of the timer\nfor the sleepiness signal.\nNow, that sleepiness signal\nthat we call melatonin\nthat's released from the pineal\ncomes only from the pineal.\nUnless you're taking exogenous melatonin,\nyou're supplementing with melatonin,\nthe only source of melatonin in your body\nis going to be this pineal gland,\nso let's talk about the\npineal gland for a second.\nThe pineal gland is a gland\nthat sits kind of in the\nlittle structure near,\nfor the aficionados out there,\nit's kind of near the fourth ventricle,\nit's about the size of a pea,\nDescartes, the philosopher,\nsaid that the pineal was\nthe seat of the soul,\nhe said that because it's\none of the few structures\nin the human brain\nthat there's only one of them,\nyou know, most structures,\nthere's one on either side of the brain,\nso-called bihemispheric,\nbut the pineal, there's only one.\nI don't know anything about souls, really,\ncertainly not the science of souls,\nbut I think it's very unlikely\nthat the pineal is the seat of the soul,\nbut it is a very interesting organ\nbecause it's the only organ in our body\nthat releases melatonin,\nand that melatonin makes us\nsleepy and lets us fall asleep.\nNow, I'm guessing that many\nof you are probably asking,\n\"Should I take melatonin?\"\nMy personal bias on this is,\nexcept in rare cases, no,\nfor the following reason,\nmelatonin has a second function,\nwhich is that melatonin\nalso suppresses the onset of puberty.\nIn kids, and especially in babies,\nmelatonin isn't just\nreleased in the evening\n12 to 16 hours after we wake,\nmelatonin is released\nchronically, or tonically,\nthroughout the day and night,\nand that chronic or tonic\nrelease of melatonin\nis known to suppress some\nof the other hormones\nin other regions of the brain\nthat trigger the onset of puberty.\nNow, if you or your child\nhas been taking melatonin,\ndon't freak out,\nas always, any kind of supplement\nor anything that you're going\nto take or think about taking,\nyou really need to\nconsult with your doctor,\nI've said this many times on this podcast\nand it's in the show notes, et cetera,\nbut before you remove anything\nor add anything to what\nyou're already doing,\nplease do consult with a\nhealthcare professional.\nHowever, melatonin is known\nto suppress the onset of puberty,\nso much so that regular, cyclic,\ncycled periods of melatonin\nrelease from the pineal\nreally correlate with the onset of puberty\nand early adulthood,\nmeaning as we start secreting\nmelatonin only at night,\nthat's also when we tend to\ntransition out of puberty.\nNow, there are a lot of\nthings that correlate\nin our nervous system,\nso that doesn't necessarily\nmean it controls it,\nbut in this case we know,\nbased on lots of data,\nendocrinology and so forth,\nthat melatonin suppresses\nthe onset of puberty,\nso supplementing melatonin\ncould be problematic\nfor that reason,\nbut if you've already\ngone through puberty,\nit could also have some impact\non other hormone systems in your body,\nso that's why I personally\ndon't like to use\nmelatonin to fall asleep.\nThere's another reason,\nwhich is that melatonin\nwill help you fall asleep\nbut it won't help you stay asleep,\nand many people who take melatonin\nfind that they wake up\nthree to five hours later\nunable to fall back asleep.\nPart of the reason for that might be\nthat melatonin purchased at,\nyou can buy it over the counter\nin most areas of the world\neven though it's a hormone,\nwhich is a little unusual,\nyou can't just go into a\npharmacy, at least in the US,\nand buy testosterone or\ncortisol or estrogen,\nyou need a prescription,\nbut you can go buy melatonin\nfor whatever reason,\nI don't know the reasons\nfor that legality,\nbut it's been shown many times,\nand now I'm borrowing from some items\nthat were in Matt Walker's\nbook, \"Why We Sleep,\"\nwhere he stated there is evidence\nthat, in commercially available melatonin,\nthe amount of melatonin has\nbeen tested for various brands,\nit can range anywhere from being\n15% of what's listed on the bottle,\nokay, so if they list\nthis as 100 milligrams,\nit would be a tremendously high dose,\nit turns out it's only 15 milligrams\nin that particular pill or capsule,\nor up to 400 times more than\nwhat's listed on the bottle,\nso it's completely unregulated,\nand so for those of you taking melatonin,\nI will discuss at the end of the podcast\nsome other potential alternatives\nthat are probably safer\nand don't have these issues.\nSo should you take melatonin?\nMy personal bias is no,\nbut for many people, they\nfind that it does help them,\nand so if you do find it helps you,\nthen just consider what I'm saying\nin light of the other\npractices that you're doing\nand talk to your healthcare professional.\nOkay, so the rhythm of\ncortisol and melatonin\nis what we call endogenous,\nit's happening in us all the time\nwithout any external input,\nin fact, if we were in complete darkness,\nliving in a cave with no\nartificial lights whatsoever,\nor we were in complete brightness\nwhere we never experienced any darkness,\nthese rhythms of cortisol\nand melatonin would continue,\nyou would have a bump in\ncortisol, or a pulse in cortisol,\nthat would drop off with time,\nand then melatonin would come\nup about 12 to 14 hours later,\nbut these endogenous systems of our body,\nwhich are both hormonal and neural,\nwere set so that external things\ncould govern when they happen.\nNow, this takes us back to\nepisode one of the podcast\nthat if you haven't listened to already,\nyou might wanna listen to,\nwhere we talked about sensation\nand perception and all that,\nI'm not gonna review it again here,\nbut there's one particular sensory event,\none particular influence\non your nervous system\nthat determines when that cortisol\nis going to start to rise,\nso if you were in complete darkness,\nit would happen once per 24-hour cycle,\nbut it would be somewhat\nlater and later each day,\nwhereas under normal circumstances,\nwhat happens is you wake up,\nand what happens when you wake up?\nYou open your eyes.\nWhen your open your eyes,\nlight comes into your eyes.\nNow, the way this system works\nis that you have a particular\nset of neurons in your eye,\nthey're called retinal ganglion cells,\nyou don't have to remember\nthat if you don't want to,\nbut these retinal ganglion\ncells are brain neurons,\nagain, the retina is just\nthe one piece of your brain,\nactually, two pieces because\nmost of you have two retinas,\nthat resides outside the skull, per se.\nWhen light comes into the eye,\nthere's a particular group\nof retinal ganglion cells,\nor type of retinal ganglion cells,\nthat perceives a particular type of light\nand communicates that to this clock\nthat resides right above\nthe roof of your mouth\ncalled the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?\nSo I know this can get\na little complicated,\nbut these retinal ganglion cells,\nwhen you open your eyes, light comes in,\nand an electrical signal is\nsent to this central clock\nwe call the suprachiasmatic nucleus,\nand the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus has connections\nwith essentially every cell\nand organ of your body.\nNow, it's vitally important\nthat we get light communicated\nto this central clock\nin order to time the cortisol\nand melatonin properly,\nand when I say properly, I\ncan say that with confidence\nbecause we know based on a lot of evidence\nthat if you don't get\nyour cortisol and melatonin rhythms right,\nthere are tremendously\nbroad and bad effects\non cardiovascular health,\ndementia, metabolic effects,\nlearning, depression, dementia,\nin fact, there're so many negative effects\nassociated with getting this wrong\nthat I don't wanna get\ninto it in too much detail,\nin fact, I feel like we've been bombarded\nwith all this information about\nhow we're not sleeping well,\nwe're not sleeping at the right times,\nwe're not sleeping enough,\nto the point where people\nnow have sleep anxiety,\nif they can't sleep well for a night,\nthey're feeling overwhelmed by that\nand it's sort of now they're stressed\nabout not being able to sleep\nwhich is making it harder\nto sleep, et cetera.\nI really wanna focus on what we can do\nto anchor these systems properly,\nso let's think about what\nhappens when we do this correctly\nand how to do it correctly.\nWhen we wake up, our eyes open,\nnow, if we're in a dark room,\nthere isn't enough light to\ntrigger the correct timing\nof this cortisol-melatonin\nthing, these rhythms.\nYou might say, \"Well, why\nwon't any light do it?\"\nWell, it turns out that\nthese neurons in our eye\nthat set the circadian clock\nand then allow our circadian\nclock to set all the clocks\nof all the cells and organs\nand tissues of our body\nresponds best to a\nparticular quality of light\nand amount of light,\nand those are the qualities\nof light and amount of light\nthat come from sunlight,\nso these neurons, what\nthey're really looking for,\nalthough they don't have\na mind of their own,\nis the sun at what we\ncall low solar angle,\nthe eye and the nervous system\ndon't know anything about\nsunrises or sunsets,\nit only knows the quality of light\nthat comes in when the\nsun is low in the sky,\nthe system evolved so that\nwhen the sun is low in the sky,\nthere's a particular contrast\nbetween yellows and blues\nthat triggers the\nactivation of these cells,\nso if you wake up and\nyou look at your phone\nor your computer,\nor you flip on a bunch\nof artificial lights,\nwill these cells be activated?\nAnd the answer is, sort of,\nthey'll be activated but\nnot in the optimal way.\nWhat you want to do is\nget sunlight in your eyes\nas close to waking as possible.\nNow, I wanna be really clear about this\nbecause I've talked about it\non other podcasts when I was a guest\nand I talked about it\non my Instagram feed,\nand there seemed to be the same questions\ncoming up again and again,\nthese neurons don't know sunlight, per se,\nthey don't know sunrise or\nsunset, for that matter,\nthey don't know artificial\nlight from sunlight,\nwhat they respond best to,\nhowever, is the quality\nand amount of light\nthat comes in when the\nsun is low in the sky,\nthat means that if you can\nwatch the sunrise, great,\nthat's perfect for triggering\nactivation of these cells,\nhowever, if you wake up a\nfew hours after the sunrise,\nwhich I tend to most days, personally,\nyou still wanna get\noutside and view sunlight,\nyou don't need the sunlight\nbeaming you directly in the eyes,\nthere's a lot of photons, light energy,\nthat's scattered from\nsunlight at this time,\nbut the key is to get that light energy,\nfrom sunlight, ideally, into your eyes.\nNow, I know many of\nyou are already asking,\n\"Well, I live in Scandinavia,\"\nor, \"I can't get sunlight,\n\"there's buildings around me,\" et cetera,\nwe will get to all of that,\nbut it's critically important\nthat you get outside to get this light.\nI had a discussion with\na colleague of mine,\nDr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in\nthe Department of Psychiatry\nand Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,\na world expert in this,\nand he tells me that it's\n50 times less effective\nto view this sunlight through a window,\nthrough a car windshield,\nor through the side window of a car\nthan it is to just get\noutside with no sunglasses\nand view light early in the day.\nNow, if you can't see the sunrise,\nlike I said, you can see this\nwithin an hour or two of sunrise,\nbut it has to be low solar angle,\nonce the sun is overhead,\nthe quality of light shifts\nso that you miss this opportunity\nto time the cortisol pulse,\nand that turns out to\nbe a bad thing to do,\nyou really wanna time that\ncortisol pulse properly\nbecause, we'll get into this\na little bit more later,\nbut a late-shifted cortisol pulse,\nin particular, a 9:00 p.m. or\n8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol\nis one of the consequences,\nand maybe one of the causes,\nof a lot of anxiety\ndisorders and depression,\nso it's kind of a chicken-egg thing,\nwe don't know whether or\nnot it's correlated with,\nit's the cause, or the effect,\nbut it's a signature of\ndepression and anxiety disorder.\nBringing that cortisol pulse\nearlier in your wakeful period,\nearlier in your day,\nhas positive benefits\nranging from blood pressure\nto mental health, et cetera,\nnot gonna list them all off\nbecause there's just so many of them,\nbut many, many positive things happen\nwhen you are getting the\ncortisol early in the day\nfar away from your melatonin pulse.\nOkay, so how long should you be outside?\nWell, this is gonna vary tremendously\nbecause some people live in environments\nwhere it's very bright,\nso let's say it's Colorado\nin the middle of winter,\nthere's a snowfield,\nthere's no cloud cover,\nand you walk outside,\nthere's going to be so\nmuch photon light energy\narriving on your retina\nthat it probably only\ntakes 30 to 60 seconds\nto trigger the central clock\nand set your cortisol and\nmelatonin rhythms properly\nand get everything lined up nicely,\nwhereas if you're in Scandinavia\nin the depths of winter\nand you wake up at 5:00 a.m.\nand the sun is just barely\ncreeping across the horizon\nand then goes back down\nagain a few hours later,\nyou probably are not\ngetting enough sunlight\nin order to set these rhythms,\nso many people find that they need to use\nsunlight simulators in the\nform of particular lights\nthat were designed to simulate sunlight,\nhowever, and I'm not out to attack\nthe companies that produce those,\nthere's another solution to that,\nyou can simply go outside for longer,\neven if there's a lot\nof dense cloud cover,\nyou're probably getting anywhere\nfrom 10,000 to 50,000 lux,\nL-U-X, which is just a\nmeasure of light energy,\nand that should be sufficient\nto set the circadian clock.\nYou could say, \"Well, the\nlights in my house or my phone\n\"are really, really bright, right?\n\"Everyone's telling us to\nstay off our phones at night\n\"because they're really bright,\"\nbut guess what, it turns\nout that early in the day,\nyour retina is not very sensitive,\nwhich means you need a lot of photons,\nideally coming from sunlight,\nto set these clock mechanisms,\nso looking at your phone or\nartificial lights is fine\nif you wake up before sunrise,\nbut it's not going to work to\nset these clock mechanisms,\nand this is supported by\ndozens, if not hundreds,\nof quality peer-reviewed studies,\nso you wanna use sunlight,\nif you can't see sunlight\nbecause of your environment,\nthen you are going to have\nto opt for artificial light,\nand in that case, you're going\nto want an artificial light\nthat either simulates sunlight\nor has a lot of blue light.\nNow, without going off course here,\nyou might be saying,\n\"Wait, I've heard blue\nlight is bad for me.\"\nActually, blue light is\ngreat for this mechanism\nduring the day,\nwe can talk about blue\nlight and blue blockers,\nbut you really want a lot\nof blue and yellow light\narriving on the retina early in the day.\nLet me be clear about something,\nyou never ever want to look at any light,\nsunlight or artificial light,\nthat is painful to look at.\nIf you find that your eyes are watering\nor you're having challenges maintaining,\nyou know, looking at\nthis thing for a while\nbecause it's painful,\nthat light is too bright\nand you do not wanna damage your retina,\nso you don't wanna gaze at\nthe sun refusing to blink\nand burn your retina, that's\nactually possible to do,\nyou don't wanna do that.\nYou have a proper blink reflex\ninstalled in you since birth,\nand if you feel like\nsomething's too bright\nand you need to blink,\nit means you need to blink,\nthat it's too much light,\nso please don't beam your\neyes with really bright light,\nbut blue light,\nin particular, blue light and yellow light\ncoming from sunlight is ideal,\nif you're going to get\nit from artificial light\nbecause you can't get enough sunlight,\nwell, then, artificial lights\nthat are rich in blue, blue wavelengths,\nare going to be ideal for\nsetting this mechanism.\nA lot of people will say, \"Oh, I should be\n\"wearing blue blockers\nthroughout the day.\"\nNo, that's the exact wrong thing,\nif you're going to use blue blockers,\nwe can talk about that,\nthat should be reserved\nfor late in the evening\nbecause light suppresses melatonin.\nI've been asked many times\nbefore about this pineal gland\nand there are a lot of ancient practices\nthat map to some of the\nthings that I'm saying,\nand people will always say,\n\"Oh, I heard that sunlight\n\"is great for the pineal.\"\nWell, perhaps, but we have\nto careful about that phrase,\nsunlight inhibits the pineal,\nit prevents it from releasing melatonin,\ndarkness allows the pineal\nto release melatonin,\nso the pineal is not the gland\nor the organ of sunlight,\nit is the gland of darkness,\nin fact, melatonin can be\nthought of as a sleepiness signal\nthat's correlated with darkness,\nso get up each morning,\ntry and get outside,\nI know that can be challenging for people,\nbut anywhere from 2 to 10\nminutes of sunlight exposure\nis going to work well for most people,\nand you wanna do this on a regular basis\nand you don't have to do\nit exactly at sunrise,\nI realize I'm repeating myself,\nbut somehow, despite\nbarking at people about this\nfor a couple years now,\nI keep getting the same questions,\nand somehow, it hasn't been sinking in,\nwhich could be related to\nsome circadian disorder,\nI'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in,\nit's probably that I'm not being effective\nin communicating the information,\nbut get that bright light\nearly in the day from sunlight,\nand if you can't get it from sunlight,\nget it from artificial light.\nWhat kinds of artificial lights will work?\nWell, there are these sunrise simulators,\nbut the ring lights that\npeople use for selfies\nand this sort of thing,\nfor posting on Instagram,\nthose generate a lot of blue light.\nIf wanna get experimental about this,\nthere's a free app, I have\nno relationship to the app,\nbut it's a great app called Light Meter\nthat you can use your phone\nand you can measure the\namount of photon energy\nin your environment,\nand it's kind of a fun experiment to do,\nyou can go outside in the morning\nand you'll see that\nthere's 10,000, 20,000 lux,\neven though it might\nseem like it's kinda dim\nor there's tree cover or cloud cover,\nyou go inside and you\nshine an artificial light\nat your phone,\npress the button on Light Meter\nand you'll find that it's\nonly 500 or 1,000 lux,\nand you realize that even\nthough it seems really bright,\nthe artificial light is very condensed,\nwhereas the outside light is\nscattered in the atmosphere,\nand so you can think that\nyou're not getting much sunlight\nbut you're actually\ngetting much more outside,\nso get outside, get that\nsunlight early in the day,\nand try and do it on a consistent basis.\nIf you can't do it every day\nor you sleep through this\nperiod of the early day,\nlow solar angle,\ndon't worry about it,\nthese systems in the body,\nthese hormone systems and\nneurotransmitter systems\nthat make you awake at\ncertain periods of the day\nand sleepy at other times\nare operating by averaging\nwhen you view the brightest light.\nNow, that can immediately tell us\nthat what most people\nare doing is terrible,\nthey're waking up and they're\nlooking at their phone,\nwhich isn't triggering activation\nof these cells in the eye\nand the central circadian clock,\nthen a few hours later,\nthey might get in their car\nwith sunglasses and drive.\nNow, a note about sunglasses\nand prescription lenses,\nabsolutely never, ever,\never compromise safety\nfor the sorts of things I'm talking about,\nso if you need to wear\nsunglasses for safety reasons,\nwear them,\nabsolutely, if you wear\nprescription lenses or contacts,\nwear them, they won't filter\nout the wavelengths of light\nthat are necessary for\nsetting these central clocks,\nso safety first, of course,\nif you have a retinal\ndegenerative disorder,\nretinitis pigmentosa, macular\ndegeneration, or glaucoma,\nor those run in your family,\nyou want to avoid excessively\nbright light all the time,\nyou wanna be very cautious about that,\nyou're going to wanna\nget your light exposure\nthrough seeing dimmer\nlight, including sunlight,\nbut for longer periods of time, perhaps.\nYou might immediately ask,\n\"What about low-vision or blind people,\n\"how do they set these central clocks?\"\nWell, turns out that\nlow-vision and blind people,\nmost of them, provided\nthey still have eyes,\nthat the eyes weren't removed\nbecause of a burn or a tumor\nor something like that,\nstill maintain these neurons\nthat set the circadian clock,\nwhich brings me to a\nreally important point,\nit's not about seeing\nand perceiving the sun,\nthis is a subconscious mechanism\nby which these neurons,\nwhich are called\nmelanopsin ganglion cells,\nthese neurons set your central clocks\nby getting activated by the\nparticular wavelengths of light\nthat are present in the atmosphere,\neven coming through cloud cover,\nand you don't need to\nsee or perceive the sun\nin order to get this mechanism to start.\nNow, it's such a vitally\nimportant mechanism\nbecause it dictates how well\nand what time you will want to\nfall asleep later in the day,\nso for those of you that are night owls\nand you insist that you're a night owl\nand you have the genetic polymorphism\nthat makes you a night owl,\nyou may very well have\nthat genetic polymorphism,\nthose genes that make\nyou want to stay up late\nand wake up late,\nbut chances are, about half of you\nthat think that you're night owls\nare just not getting enough\nsunlight early in the day.\nSo viewing light early in\nthe day, ideally sunlight,\nis key for establishing\nhealthy sleep-wake rhythms\nand for allowing you to\nfall asleep easily at night.\nNow, it's not gonna make sure\nthat all that happens every single time,\nbut it is the foundation of proper sleep\nand what we call circadian health,\nit governs metabolism\nand so many other things\nthat are supposed to exist\non a regular 24-hour cycle.\nSome of you, many of you, might be asking,\n\"What else can help set this rhythm?\"\nWell, it turns out that light\nis what we call the primary\nzeitgeber, the time giver,\nbut other things can help\nestablish this rhythm of cortisol\nfollowed by melatonin 12\nto 16 hours later as well.\nThe other things besides light\nare timing of food intake,\ntiming of exercise,\nas well as various drugs or\nchemicals that one might ingest,\nnot illegal drugs,\nalthough those will impact\ncircadian mechanisms as well,\nbut the reason we focus\nso heavily on light\nis that light is the main\nway that this central clock,\nthe suprachiasmatic nucleus,\nwas supposed to be set,\nand we know that because\nit's the only direct input\nto the clock.\nThese neurons in the eye that\nare also part of the brain\nthat we call melanopsin ganglion cells\nthat, not so incidentally, were discovered\nby my friend and colleague David\nBerson at Brown University,\nand others, Samer Hattar,\nKing-Wai Yau, et cetera,\nworked out the mechanisms,\nthe molecular mechanisms,\nbut it was really David Berson\nthat discovered these\nincredibly fascinating,\nyou know, these are cells that\naren't important for sight\nlike pattern vision,\nbut are for setting our clocks,\nDavid's really credited\nwith making that discovery.\nThose cells are the main way\nand the only direct way to set the clock,\nin fact, it's fair to say\nthat light viewed by\nthese melanopsin cells,\nin particular, sunlight,\nis 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective\nthan, say, getting up in\ndarkness and just exercising.\nThat doesn't mean that you shouldn't\nexercise early in the day in darkness\nif that's what you like to do,\nit will have somewhat an effect\non raising your wakefulness\nearly in the day\nand setting these rhythms,\nand this is because of\nsome other pathways,\nfor the aficionados out there\nwho wanna know more neuroscience,\nhere's how it goes, you've got this clock\nabove the roof of your mouth\nthat churns out this 24-hour rhythm\nand it's communicated\nto all the other organs\nand tissues of your body,\nbut there's another structure,\nit has a cool name, it's called\nthe intergeniculate leaflet,\nwhich sits a few millimeters\naway in the brain,\nand it's involved in\nregulating the clock output\nthrough what's called non-photic,\nnon-light-type influences\nlike exercise and feeding, et cetera.\nSo if you are not feeling\nawake during the day\nand you're having trouble sleeping,\nget the sunlight exposure\nthat we just talked about,\nbut in addition to that,\nif you wanna become an\nearly riser, for instance,\nand you wanna feel more awake\nduring the early part of the day,\nby getting that light exposure\nand exercising early in the day,\nyou will, after two or three days,\nyou will naturally start to\nwake up earlier in the day,\nand that's because these\nclock mechanisms have shifted,\nit's like setting the clock earlier\nas opposed to delaying the clock,\nand that takes us to a\nsomewhat complicated,\nbut very important, aspect to all this,\nwhich is, what sets the\nclock and keeps it anchored?\nThe main thing is that bright\nlight early in the day,\nthe other thing is sunset,\nwhen the sun is also at low solar angle,\nlow, close to the horizon,\nby viewing sunlight at that\ntime of day in the evening,\nor afternoon, depending\non what time of year it is\nand where you are in the world,\nthese melanopsin cells,\nthese neurons in your eye,\nsignal the central circadian clock\nthat it's the end of the day,\nand there's a really nice study\nthat was published last year,\nand I will put links to\nthese references on a website\nnot too long from now,\nthere was a really nice study that showed\nthat viewing sunlight around\nthe time of the sunset,\ndoesn't have to be just\ncrossing the horizon,\nbut circa sunset,\nwithin an hour or so of sunset,\nprevents some of the bad effects of light\nin preventing melatonin\nrelease later that same night,\nso let me repeat this,\nviewing light early in the day is key,\nviewing light later in the day\nwhen the sun is setting,\nor around that time,\ncan help protect these\nmechanisms, your brain and body,\nagainst the negative effects\nof light later in the day,\nso let me talk about you would do that,\nyou'd go view the sunset\nor you would go outside in\nthe late afternoon or evening,\nagain, if you safely can do that\nwith sunglasses off, you will,\nif you need to wear sunglasses, fine,\nbut it will take probably\n100 to 1,000 times longer\nwith dark sunglasses than\nif you take them off,\nagain, if you wanna do this\nthrough a window at work,\nthat's fine, but it'll\ntake 50 times longer,\nso the best thing to do is\njust to get outside for a few minutes,\nanywhere from 2 to 10 minutes,\nalso in the afternoon.\nHaving those two signals\narriving to your central clock\nthat your body, your internal world,\nknows when it's morning and\nknows when it's evening,\nis tremendously powerful.\nMaybe think about it this way,\nevery cell in your body\nneeds glucose and energy,\nit needs, whether or not\nit gets that from meats\nor it gets it from ketones or\nit gets it from carbohydrates\nor fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter,\nit is eventually converted\ninto a certain form of energy\nthat all your cells use,\nbut you don't take glucose,\nyou don't take bread or\na steak or a nice orange\nand shove it in your ear,\nyou put it in your mouth,\nit goes into your stomach, it's digested,\nand then that resource is distributed\nto all the cells of your body.\nEvery cell in your body needs oxygen,\nand you don't put a hose\nyou know, through your\nnostril or through your ear\nor through some other\norifice in your body,\nyou inhale air and it's then\ndistributed via the lungs\nto the cells in your blood stream,\nand then it's distributed to\nall the organs of your body.\nEvery cell and organ in your\nbody needs light information,\nand the way to get that light information\nto all those cells,\nbecause you have a thick skull\nand the inside of you is\ndark inside your skin,\nthere's no sunlight getting in there,\nis by viewing sunlight with your eyes\nat the two times of day\nthat I'm referring to, okay?\nThat's the only route.\nThere was a study published in \"Science,\"\nan excellent journal,\nwell over 10 years ago,\nthat showed that light shone\non the back of the knee\ncould set these circadian rhythms,\nthat study was retracted,\nand unfortunately, most people don't know\nthat it was retracted,\nthere were some experimental flaws,\nthat people were actually viewing light\nthrough their eyes.\nThat study was repeated,\nturns out, there is no\nextraocular photo reception in humans.\nWhatever somebody tells you\nthat light to the skin\nor light to the wherever\nis beneficial for your health,\nwe can talk about that,\nbut there's no way that light information\nis setting your clocks,\nyou need these cells in your eyes\nto perceive or to see light\nat the particular times of\nday that I'm referring to.\nSome animals, like snakes\nand other reptiles,\nactually have a hole in\nthe top of their skull\nto get light information\ndirectly to their pineal\nto suppress melatonin.\nWe don't have that hole,\nI mean, most of you don't\nhave holes in your skull.\nThese holes in your skull\nthat we call the sockets for the eyes\nare actually there primarily\nto allow light information\nto this central clock,\nand then vision and pattern\nvision and color vision\ncame much later in evolution,\nwe know this on the\nbasis of genetic studies\nwe get to discuss in a future podcast.\nSo get that light information\nto the cells of your brain and body\nby viewing sunlight at\nthe two times of day\nthat I referred to.\nThere's always a lot of questions about,\n\"How long, how much, how do\nI know if I've had enough?\"\nYou'll know because your rhythm\nwill start to fall into\nsome degree of normalcy,\nyou'll start to wake up\nat more or less the same time each day,\nyou'll fall asleep more easily at night,\ngenerally, it takes\nabout two or three days\nfor these systems to align,\nso if you've not been\ndoing these behaviors,\nit's gonna take a few days,\nbut they can have tremendous benefits,\nand sometimes rather quickly,\non a number of different\nmental and physical aspects\nof your health.\nNow let's talk about\nthe bad effects of light\nbecause light is not supposed\nto arrive in our system\nat any time,\nand nowadays, because of\nscreens and artificial light,\nwe have access to light\nat times of day and night\nthat normally we wouldn't.\nNow, earlier I said that\nyou need a lot of light,\nin particular, sunlight,\nto set these clock mechanisms,\nthat's true, but there's a\nkind of diabolical feature\nto the way all of this works,\nwhich is the longer you've been awake,\nthe more sensitive your retina\nand these cells are to light,\nso that if you've been\nawake for 10, 12, 14 hours,\nit becomes very easy for\neven a small amount of light\ncoming from a screen or\nfrom an overhead light\nto trigger the activation of the clock\nand make you feel like\nyou wanna stay up later,\nmake it harder to fall asleep,\nand disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?\nSo the simple way to think about this is\nyou want as much light\nas is safely possible\nearly in the day, morning\nand throughout the day,\nincluding blue light,\nso take those blue\nblockers off during the day\nunless you have a real issue\nwith screen light sensitivity,\nand you want as little\nlight coming into your eyes,\nartificial or sunlight,\nafter, say, 8:00 p.m.,\nand certainly, you do not want to get\nbright light exposure to your eyes\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., and here's why,\nDavid Berson, who I mentioned before,\nand another and friend and\ncolleague, Samer Hattar,\nwho's director of the chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health\npublished a paper in\n\"Cell,\" which is a journal,\nanother excellent journal,\nvery high stringency,\nshowing that light that\narrives to the eyes\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., approximately,\nsuppresses the release of dopamine,\nthis neuromodulator\nthat makes us feel good,\nand it's sort of an\nendogenous antidepressant,\nand can inhibit learning\nand create all sorts of\nother detrimental effects,\nit does this through a mechanism,\nfor those of you that wanna\nknow the neural pathways,\nthat involves light to the eyes\nthat's then signaled to a\nstructure called the habenula,\nthe habenula looks like\ntwo little bat ears\nsitting right in the middle\nof a structure in your brain\ncalled the thalamus,\ndon't worry about these names\nif you're not interested in this stuff,\nif you are, these are\njust avenues to explore,\nwhen that habenula gets activated\nit's actually called the\ndisappointment nucleus\nbecause it actually\nmakes us feel less happy\nand more disappointed,\nand can lead to certain\nforms of depression\nin the wakeful state.\nNow, if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night\nand you need to use the bathroom\nor you're on an all-night flight\nand you're, you know, need to\nread or whatever it is, fine,\nevery once in a while,\nit's not gonna be a problem\nto get bright light exposure to your eyes\nin the middle of the night,\nbut if you think about\nour lifestyle nowadays\nand being up late looking at phones,\neven if you dim that screen,\nyou're triggering this activation\nbecause your retinal sensitivity\nand the sensitivity of\nthese neurons has gone up\nlate in the day.\nNow, I'm not here to dictate\nwhat you should or shouldn't do,\nbut for those of you that are\nexperiencing challenges with mood,\nthose of you that have anxiety,\nlearning problems, issues focusing,\nthe questions I usually get\nare, \"How can I focus better?\"\nWell, we will get to that,\nbut one of the best ways you can support\nyour mechanisms for good\nmood, mental health,\nlearning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,\nis to take control of this\nlight exposure behavior at night\nand not get much or any\nbright light exposure\nin the middle of the night.\nRed light won't trigger this pathway,\nbut very few people have\nthe kind of infrared lights\nthat are set up, or floor lights,\nand that brings me to an important point,\nwhich is about the location of light,\nthis hasn't been discussed\nmuch out there, I don't think,\nthese cells in our eye,\nthese neurons that\nsignal the central clock,\nreside mostly, not\nexclusively, but mostly,\nin the bottom half of our retina,\nand because we have a lens\nin front of our retina,\nand because of the optics of lenses,\nthat means that these cells\nare actually viewing\nour upper visual field,\nthere's an inversion of the\nvisual image, et cetera,\nyou can look that up\nif you wanna learn more\nabout retinal optics, it's fascinating,\nbut not the topic for today.\nThese cells are in the bottom\nhalf of your retina mostly,\nand so they're viewing the\noverhead visual space around you.\nThis is probably not\ncoincidental that these cells\nwere essentially designed\nto detect sunlight,\nwhich is overhead, of course,\nso if you want to avoid\nimproper activation of these neurons,\nit's better to place lights\nthat you use in the evening\nlow in your physical environment,\nso on desktops or even the\nfloor, if you wanna go that way,\nas opposed to overhead lights,\nso overhead florescent\nlights would be the worst,\nthat would be the worst case scenario,\nlights that are overhead\nthat are a little bit softer,\nof the sort or yellow or reddish tints,\nwould be slightly better,\nbut dim lights that\nare set low in the room\nare going to be best\nbecause they aren't going\nto activate these neurons\nand therefore shift your circadian clock,\nso that's a goal.\nSome people, like Samer Hattar\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nhe turns his home basically\ninto a cave in the evenings.\nCandlelight actually does not\ntrigger activation of these cells,\nso candlelight and fireplaces\nand campfires are fine,\ndim lights, very dim lights are fine,\nand lights low in the\nphysical environment,\nof course, the problem with\ncandlelight and fireplaces\nis the fire hazard,\nbut you're smart people, you\nknow what to do about that.\nDon't burn down whatever\nstructure you're in,\nincluding forests, please.\nSo, keep the lights low\nin in your environment.\nWhat if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night\nand you find yourself watching\nTV or on the computer?\nWell, in that case, you might\nwanna wear blue blockers,\nand you certainly would\nwanna dim the screen,\nbut ideally, you're not doing that,\nit's remarkable the positive effects\nof getting that bit of\nsunlight early in the day,\nmaybe even also around sunset,\nand avoiding bright lights,\nand especially overhead bright lights,\nbetween about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..\nNow, I'm not talking about shift work,\nI'm realizing that we're probably\ngonna have to have an entire discussion\ndevoted just to shift workers\nbecause there's some\ngood information there\nabout how they can protect themselves\nagainst some of the very bad\nhealth effects of shift work,\nof getting light in the\nmiddle of the night,\nbut we rely on shift workers\nand they're super important to culture\nand society and the economy,\nso I wanna acknowledge them\nand let you know that\nwe will do a discussion\nabout shift work and jet lag,\nbut let's talk about what light can do\nin terms of shifting us in healthy ways.\nSo the way to think\nabout this whole system,\nagain, is you've got adenosine building up\ndepending on how long you've been awake\nand it's making you sleepy,\nand then you've got the\ncircadian mechanisms\nthat are timing your wakefulness\nand timing when you wanna be asleep,\nmainly through cortisol and melatonin,\nbut there are a bunch of other things\nthat are downstream of\ncortisol and melatonin,\nlike, we tend to be hungrier\nduring our wakeful period\nthan late at night,\nsome people like to eat late at night,\nbut if you're finding that you\ncan't become a day person\nor a morning person,\nshifting your light exposure, exercise,\nand food intake to the daytime will help.\nSome people like to stop\neating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m.\nbecause of metabolic reasons\nor they're trying to maintain\ntheir weight or lose weight,\nthat's actually not supported\nso well by the literature,\nthe literature around\nnutrition essentially says\nthat it's best to restrict your feeding\nto a certain period of each 24-hour cycle\nto not be eating around the clock,\nand whether or not that's 4\nhours or 8 hours or 16 hours\nis a much lengthier discussion\nthan we have time for now,\nI would refer you to Satchin Panda's book,\n\"The Circadian Code,\"\nwhich talks all about that,\nhe's an expert, a former colleague of mine\nfrom the Salk Institute in San Diego,\nyou can explore intermittent\nand circadian fasting,\nso to speak, through Satchin's literature,\nwe'll talk about that,\nwe might even get Satchin\nin here if we're lucky\nat some point in the future,\nbut you can actually use\nlight to wake up earlier.\nJamie Zeitzer and colleagues\ndid a beautiful study\nshowing that, if you turn on\nthe lights before waking up,\nso around 45 minutes to\nan hour before waking up,\neven if your eyelids are closed,\nprovided you're not under the covers,\nafter doing that for a few days,\nthat increases your total sleep time\nand shifts forward the time\nat which you feel sleepy,\nit makes you want to go\nto bed earlier each night.\nNow, in a kind of diabolical way,\nthey did this with teenagers\nwho are notorious for\nwanting to wake up late\nand stay up late,\nand what they found was\nbright light flashes,\njust turning on the lights\nin their environment, overhead lights,\nbecause they're trying\nto activate this system\nand that's why they're\nusing overhead lights,\neven through the eyelids,\nbefore these kids woke up,\nthen made those kids naturally\nwanna go to bed earlier\nand they ended up sleeping longer,\nso that's something you could try,\nyou could put your lights on a timer\nto go on early in the\nday before you wake up,\nyou could open your blinds\nso that sunlight is coming through,\nand again, if you curl\nup under the covers,\nthen it's not gonna reach these neurons,\nbut it's remarkable that light\ncan actually penetrate the eyelids,\nactivate these neurons, and\ngo to the central clock.\nThat study illustrates a\nreally important principle\nof how you're built,\nwhich is, you have the capacity\nfor what are called phase\nadvances and phase delays,\nand I don't wanna\ncomplicate this too much,\nso the simplest way to think about\nphase advances and phase delays\nis that if you see light late in the day,\nand in particular, in\nthe middle of the night,\nyour brain and body, for\nreasons that now you understand,\nwill think that that's morning light\neven though it's not sunlight\nbecause you have this\nheightened sensitivity,\nand it will phase delay,\nit will delay your clock,\nit will essentially make\nyou want to get up later\nand go to sleep later,\nso if you get light exposure\ntoo late in the evening\nor in the middle of the night,\nit's going to make it hard\nto want to wake up that next morning early\nand to go to bed early.\nThe opposite is also true,\nif you wake up early,\nsay, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.,\nand get light exposure,\nor even earlier, 4:00 a.m.,\nand get light exposure,\nit will phase-advance your clock, okay?\nIt's gonna make your\nclock think it's earlier\nand you'll wanna wake up earlier,\nso the simple way to think about this\nis if you're having\ntrouble waking up early\nand feeling alert early in the day,\nyou're going to wanna try\nand get bright light exposure\neven before waking up because\nit will advance your clock,\nit's sort of like turning\nthe clock forward,\nwhereas if you are having\ntrouble waking up early,\nyou definitely don't want to get\ntoo much light exposure\nor any light exposure\nto your eyes late in the evening\nand in the middle of the night\nbecause it's just gonna delay\nyour clock more and more,\nso rather than get into the specifics\nof everybody's situation\nbecause there are many of you out there\nwith different situations\nand lifestyle requirements, et cetera,\nthe way to think about this\nis that you have these internal mechanisms\nof adenosine and circadian clocks,\nand they're always operating,\nand what you're trying to\ndo is provide them anchors,\nyou're trying to provide them\nconsistent, powerful anchors\nso that your cortisol, your melatonin,\nand then everything that\ncascades down from that,\nlike your metabolism and\nyour ability to learn\nand your sense of alertness,\nyour dopamine, your serotonin,\nall that stuff is timed regularly,\none of the reasons why there's\nso much challenge out there\nwith focus and anxiety and depression,\nthere are a lot of reasons for that,\nbut one of the reasons is that\npeople's internal mechanisms\naren't anchored to anything regular.\nNow, this doesn't require\nbeing neurotically attached\nto getting up at a very\nspecific time, going outside,\nviewing the sunlight at\nthe same time every day,\nthese systems, again, will average,\nbut if you can provide them\nconsistent light anchors\nearly in the day and in the evening,\nand avoiding light at night,\nyou will be amazed at\nthe tremendous number\nof positive effects\nthat can come from that\nat the level of metabolic\nfactors, hormones,\nand just general feelings of wellbeing,\nin fact, most of us are familiar\nwith what it is to not sleep well\nand all the terrible effects that has,\nmaybe one night you're\nfine, two nights even,\nfor the new parents out\nthere, I sympathize with you,\nbut most people are not\nfamiliar with what it is\nto sleep really, really\nwell on a consistent basis,\nand when you start doing that\nby controlling your\nsleep environment, right,\nget the proper sleep surface,\nget the proper pillow,\nget the temperature in the room right,\nget your light exposure right,\nstart timing your exercise\nat normal periods or times\nthroughout the day and week,\nit's amazing how many\nother biological systems\njust naturally fall in line,\nand this is why whenever people ask me,\n\"What should I take?\"\nwhich is one of the most\ncommon questions I get,\n\"What supplement should I take?\n\"What drug should I be taking?\n\"What things should I be taking?\"\nThe first question I always ask\nthem is, \"How's your sleep?\"\nand 90% of the time, they tell me\nthey either have trouble\nfalling asleep or staying asleep\nor they don't feel rested\nthroughout the day.\nA brief note about naps,\nnaps, provided that they're\nless than one ultradian cycle,\nprovided they're 20 minutes\nor 30 minutes or even an hour,\ncan be very beneficial\nfor a lot of people,\nyou don't have to take them,\nbut many people naturally feel a dip\nin energy and focus late in the afternoon,\nin fact, if we were gonna\nlook at wakefulness,\nwhat we would find is that you get\nthat morning light exposure, hopefully,\nyour cortisol goes up, people\nwill start feeling awake,\nand then around two, or three,\nor four in the afternoon,\nthere's a spike in everything\nfrom alertness to ability to learn,\nsome metabolic factors drop,\nand then it just naturally comes back up,\nand then it tapers off\nas the night goes on.\nSo for some of you, naps are great,\nI love taking naps,\nsome people, they wake up from\nnaps feeling really groggy,\nthat's probably because\nthey're not sleeping\nas well as they should at night\nor as long as they should at night,\nand so they're dropping into REM sleep\nor deeper forms of sleep in the day time,\nand then they wake up and\nthey feel kind of disoriented,\nother people feel great after a nap,\nso that's another case where,\njust like with caffeine,\nso sort of have to evaluate for yourself.\nAs we discuss this,\nyou're probably realizing\nthis is a lot like nutrition\nwhere nowadays it's just crazy,\nI mean, if you go on social media,\nit's like you've got people\nwho are pushing carnivore,\nyou've got other people\nwho are pushing vegan,\nother people who are pushing paleo,\nevery variation of every diet,\nand there's a lot of data to support\nany and all of those and\nthe arguments go on and on,\nand there's probably a\nlot of genetic variation\nand lifestyle variation\nthat's going to dictate whether or not\nsomething is good for you,\nwhether or not you like it,\nwhether or not you'll stick to it.\nThe same thing is true for circadian\nand sleep and wakefulness behaviors,\nexcept the light-viewing behavior\nthat I talked about before,\nthere's no way around that,\nthat's hardwired into our system,\nthe same way we could factually say\nthat everybody needs some nutrition\nat some level from some source,\neverybody needs light information\narriving in their system in\nsome way at regular intervals,\nso that's really what this is about.\nOkay, so naps are gonna\nbe good for some people,\nnot for others,\nI have a colleague, a very\naccomplished neuroscientist,\nwho likes to take naps just after lunch,\nI personally like to take a\nnap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.,\nbut there's a practice\nthat I've adopted in the last 5 years\nthat I've found to be immensely beneficial\nthat is sort of like\nnapping but isn't napping,\nit's a thing that they call yoga nidra,\nyoga nidra actually means yoga sleep,\nand it's a sort of meditation\nthat you listen to,\nthere are number of scripts,\nI've talked about this on podcasts before\nbut I'm going to post a link\nto the two that I like most,\nthat allows you to consciously\nbring your entire body and mind\ninto a state of deep relaxation,\nand sometimes you fall asleep\nand sometimes you don't,\nthis is done for 10 to 30 or\neven 60 minutes at a time.\nThe other thing that works\nreally well is meditation,\nso I'm talking about naps,\nbut I'm also talking about yoga nidra,\nwhich is sort of a form of meditation,\nand then more standard\nforms of meditation,\nall three of those do something powerful\nwhich is that they bring our mind\ninto a state of less so-called\nsympathetic nervous system activation,\ngo back and listen to episode one\nif that doesn't make any sense,\nwhich is what governs your alertness,\nand instead, it activates\ncells and circuits in your body\nthat promote the\nparasympathetic nervous system,\nor the calming system.\nA lot of people are\nnot good falling asleep\nbecause they're not good at calming down,\nso some people have no\ntrouble falling asleep,\nbut many people have a\nhard time falling asleep,\nor at least every once in a while\nexperience challenges falling asleep.\nI don't have problems\nfalling asleep most nights,\nbut I've noticed that\nif I'm working very hard\nor if the world is particularly stressful,\nmy mind gets into a bit\nof a kind of OCD loop\nwhere I tend to ruminate on things,\nand I'm not even thinking\nabout anything in particular,\nit's just challenging for me\nto disengage and fall asleep.\nMeditation and yoga nidra scripts\nhave been immensely helpful for me\nin terms of accelerating\nthe transition to sleep,\nso they involve taking a few minutes,\n10 to 30 minutes or so,\njust like you would for a nap,\nand just listening to a\nscript, almost passively,\nand it has you do some\nparticular patterns of breathing\nand some other kind of\nbody-scan-like things\nthat can really help\npeople learn to relax,\nnot just in that moment,\nbut get better at relaxing\nand turning off thinking\nin order to fall asleep when\nthey wanna do that at night.\nThere's another thing\nthat's similar to this,\nwhich is certain forms\nof hypnosis for sleep,\nfor that, I'll just\nrefer you to the website\nof a colleague and collaborator of mine,\nDavid Spiegel, who's our associate chair\nof Psychiatry and Behavioral\nSciences at Stanford,\nhe's developed a website,\nwhich is reverie,\nR-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com,\nso reveriehealth.com,\nthat has a lot of science-supported,\nclinically supported hypnosis scripts\nthat essentially take the brain\ninto states of deep relaxation\nfor the sake of rewiring the\nbrain and neuroplasticity,\nbut one of those scripts that's there\nand is available free is for sleep,\nand we'll talk more about\nhypnosis at a later time\nbecause it has a ton of other effects\nthat aren't just limited to sleep.\nSo a period of time each day\nthat you devote to getting better\nat falling and staying asleep\nis actually a really\ngood practice to adopt.\nThe other thing about these practices\nlike meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis,\nis people would always say to me,\n\"Well, when should I do them?\"\nand I always say, \"Well, the\nbest time of day to do it\n\"is when you first wake up in the morning,\n\"provided you've gotten\nyour sunlight already,\n\"anytime you wake up in\nthe middle of the night,\n\"or any time of day.\"\nIn other words, they're\nalways good for you\nbecause it's a training mechanism\nby which you self-train\nyour nervous system\nto go from a state of heightened alertness\nthat you don't want\nto heightened relaxation that you do want,\nand so it's really teaching\nyou to hit the brake,\nand that brings us to an even\nmore important point, perhaps,\nwhich is, we've all experienced\nthat we can stay up if we want to, right?\nIf we wanna stay up late on New Year's\nor we wanna push an all-nighter,\nsome people can do that\nmore easily than others,\nbut we're all capable of doing that,\nbut it's very hard to make\nourselves fall asleep,\nand so there's a sort of asymmetry\nto the way our autonomic nervous system,\nwhich governs this\nalertness-calmness thing,\nthe sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous system,\nthere's an asymmetry there\nwhere we are more easily\nable to engage wakefulness\nand drive wakefulness,\nwe can force ourselves to stay awake,\nthan we are able to force\nourselves to fall asleep,\nand one of the things that\nI say over and over again,\nand I'm gonna continue to\nsay over and over again,\nis it's very hard to control\nthe mind with the mind,\nwhen you have trouble falling asleep,\nyou need to look to some\nmechanism that involves the body,\nand all the things I described,\nmeditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra,\nall involve exhale-emphasized breathing,\ncertain ways of lying down\nand controlling the body,\nwe're gonna get into\nbreathing in real depth\nat another time,\nbut all of those involve using\nthe body to control the mind\nrather than trying to, you know,\nwrestle your mind into a\ncertain pattern of relaxation,\nso earlier in episode one, I\ntalked about the Mobius strip,\nthis continuous loop that is\nthe brain-body relationship,\nor the mind-body relationship,\nand when we're having\ntrouble controlling the mind,\nI encourage people to\nlook towards the body,\nlook toward sunlight,\navoid sunlight and bright light\nif that happens to be late at night,\nso there's a theme\nthat's starting to emerge\nwhich is, in order to control this thing\nthat we call the nervous system,\nwe have to look back to\nsome of the things we discussed earlier,\nlike sensation, perception, et cetera,\nbut we have to ask, what can we control?\nWell, I'm talking about\ncontrolling light exposure,\ncontrolling your breathing and body,\nI'm not going into details right now\nbut you can see the yoga nidra script\nor the reveriehealth.com,\nor Headspace would be a great place\nto adopt a meditation practice,\nany of those are really teaching you\nto use your body to control your mind,\nand to allow you to explore\nthe mind-body relationship\nin a way that gives you more control\nover your mind and the\nmind-body relationship, okay?\nSo we talked about light,\nwe talked about activity\nand timing of light,\nwe talked about the usefulness of naps,\nand these things that I'm\ncalling non-sleep deep rest,\nwhich include meditation,\nyoga nidra, and hypnosis,\nnon-sleep deep rest,\nor what I, hereafter, we\nwill refer to as NSDR,\nnot to be confused with EMDR,\nI don't think I've ever heard NSDR,\nso I'm planting a flag for\nNSDR, non-sleep deep rest,\nas a way to reset one's\nability to be awake\nafter you emerge from NSDR,\nso to get some more wakefulness\nand ability to attend,\nsome emotional stability, reset,\nas well as make it better\nand easier to fall asleep\nwhen you wanna go to sleep at night.\nNow, the non-sleep deep rest\ndoes have some research to support it,\nthere's a beautiful study done\nout of a university in Denmark,\nI will later provide a link to that study,\nthat showed that this meditation\nand yoga nidra-type meditation\nallows dopamine and other neuromodulators\nin an area of the brain\ncalled the striatum\nthat's involved in motor\nplanning and motor execution,\nto reset itself,\nin other words, this NSDR\ncan reset our ability\nto engage in the world in a\nway that's very deliberate,\nand not to throw in another acronym,\nbut NSDR resets your\nability to engage in DPOs,\nduration, path, and outcome,\nso now you're probably\nrolling your eyes like,\n\"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,\"\nbut just bear with me\nbecause NSDR is so powerful,\nbecause first of all, it doesn't require\nthat you rig yourself to any device,\nit doesn't require that you\ntake much time out of your day,\nit doesn't require that you\ningest anything, except air,\nand it can have so many positive effects\nright down to the neuromodulator level,\nso I think in the years to come,\nmy lab's exploring this\nin a collaboration with\nDavid Spiegel's lab,\nbut other labs are\nlooking at this as well,\nI think NSDR is going to start\nto play a more prominent role\nin what we call wellness and health,\nboth mental health and physical health,\nso I encourage you to\nexplore those practices.\nOkay, so what about things that we can\nand maybe should or should not take\nin order to control\nand access better sleep\nand better wakefulness?\nWe've talked about things\nyou can do or not do,\nwe've talked about nutrition\nand the timing of nutrition,\nnow let's talk about compounds,\nthose could be prescription drugs,\nthose could be supplements,\nthere are a number of different things\nthat will affect your\ncircadian timing and behavior,\nin fact, almost everything\nthat you could take\nwill affect your circadian\ntiming and behavior,\nthat's right.\nSo years ago when I\nwas in graduate school,\nI had a professor, unfortunately,\nhe passed away now,\nbut his name was Ted Jones,\nthe late Edward Jones,\nwho was a world-class neuroanatomist,\nhe wrote the book on the thalamus,\nin fact, it's called \"The Thalamus,\"\nand an expert on patterns\nof activation in the brain\nduring sleep,\nand I'll never forget that\nduring one of these lectures,\nsomeone asked Ted the question,\n\"What is the effect of some drug\n\"on these waves of activity in\nthe thalamus?\" or something,\nand his answer was incredible.\nNow, he was a pretty gruff guy,\nand so his answer was delivered\nin the form of a kind of\naggressive direct statement,\nhe said, \"A drug is a substance\n\"that when injected into a person,\n\"produces a scientific publication,\"\nand what he was saying\nis actually quite true,\nwhich is that most every compound\nwill have some effect on\nsome aspect of biology,\nthis is why it's hard\nto sort through everything\nthat's on PubMed,\nif you put any molecule or\ncompound or drug into PubMed\nand then you put sleep next to\nit, or alertness next to it,\nyou're likely to find a paper\nwhere there's an effect,\nbut that's not necessarily telling you\nthat that drug is helpful for that,\nwhat it's telling you is\nthat anytime you change what you take\nor you stop taking something,\nsay you're taking sleeping\npills, Ambien or whatever it is,\nand you stop taking them,\nyour sleep behavior will change.\nLet's stay you take an aspirin\nand you don't normally take aspirin,\nyou will shift your circadian rhythm,\nnow you might not shift it perceptibly,\nyou might not create\nproblems for yourself,\nbut anytime you ingest a\ncompound at high potency,\nyou're going to provide some\nshift to your circadian rhythm.\nNow, that said, there are a couple things\nthat are directly in line with the biology\nrelated to falling and staying asleep\nand directly in line with\nthe biology of wakefulness,\nthere's a whole category of things,\nlike stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine,\nand prescription stimulants, that are,\nthe prescription ones were designed\nfor the treatment of narcolepsy,\nso things like modafinil or armodafinil\nthat are designed to created wakefulness,\nthey are all essentially chemical variants\nof things that increase\nepinephrine and dopamine.\nNow, of course, I'm of the standpoint\nthat things like cocaine and amphetamine\nare just across the board bad,\nthey have so many addictive\nand terrible effects,\nin the proper setting prescribed\nby the proper professional,\nthings like modafinil for\nnarcolepsy might be appropriate,\nI know that a lot of people\nout there take Adderall,\neven though they haven't\nbeen prescribed Adderall,\nin order to increase wakefulness,\nthat is essentially, well,\nit's illegal for one,\nbut also it's abusing the system\nin the sense that you're pushing back\non the adenosine system\nslightly differently\nthan you do caffeine,\nit will make you feel more alert,\nthere tends to be a heavy rebound\nand they do have an addictive potential,\nthere are also some other effects of those\nthat could be quite bad,\nso we're gonna explore stimulants\nin a whole month related to drugs,\nbut there are some supplements\nand some things that are\nsafer, certainly safer,\nand that, in cases where you're\ndoing all the right behaviors,\nyou're exercising and eating correctly\nand you're still having\ntrouble with sleep,\nthat can be beneficial for\nfalling and staying asleep.\nNow, I wanna be very clear,\nI am not pushing supplements,\nI am just pointing you toward some things\nthat have been shown in\npeer-reviewed studies\nto have some benefit.\nThe first one is magnesium,\nthere are many forms of magnesium,\nbut certain forms of magnesium\ncan have positive effects on sleepiness\nand the ability to stay asleep,\nmainly by way of increasing\nneurotransmitters like GABA\nwhich help turn off the DPO,\nthe kind of thinking about the future,\nduration-path-outcome analysis,\nand make one's mind kind\nof drift in space and time\nand make it easier to fall asleep,\nthere are a lot of forms\nof magnesium out there,\nbut in particular is magnesium\nthreonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,\nwhich you have to check to\nsee if this is right for you,\ncheck with your doctor,\nbut magnesium threonate is\nassociated with transporters in the body\nthat bring more of it into cells\nthat allow people to feel\nthis kind of drowsiness\nand help them fall asleep,\nso I personally, I can only\ntalk about what I personally do,\nI personally take 3 or 400\nmilligrams of magnesium threonate\nabout 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,\nand it helps me fall asleep.\nThe other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A,\nT-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,\n100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me,\nalso helps me turn off\nmy mind and fall asleep,\nI take it 30 to 60 minutes\nthroughout the day.\nInterestingly, theanine\nis now being introduced\nto a lot of energy drinks\nin order to take away the jitters\nthat are associated with\ndrinking too much caffeine\nor with some other things\nthat are in the energy drinks,\nenergy drinks can be problematic,\nthey can contain a lot of L-taurine,\nI'll just tell you an anecdote,\nwhen I was a postdoc,\nI was drinking a lot of a\nparticular energy drink,\nit has a lot of taurine in it,\nand actually the whites of my eyes,\nthe sclera, as it's called,\nof my eyes turned beet red,\nand I went to a friend\nwho's an ophthalmologist,\nI said, \"Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker,\n\"I haven't been hit on the head,\n\"I don't know what's going on,\"\nand he looked and he said,\n\"I think you've got some\nmicrovascular damage,\"\nand we walked through what\nI was taking and doing,\nand he said, \"Oh, it's\nprobably the taurine,\n\"excessive levels of taurine\n\"can create some microvascular damage.\"\nSo if you're having\nmicrovascular damage in your eye,\nyou probably have microvascular damage\ndeeper in your skull, so I stopped,\nthat's the reason why I\ndon't take energy drinks,\nso just a consideration,\nagain, I'm not here to tell\nyou what to do or not do,\nbut just wanna arm you with information.\nThe thing about theanine and magnesium\nis taken together, they\ndo, for some people,\nthey can make them so\nsleepy and sleep so deeply\nthat they actually have trouble\nwaking up in the morning,\nso you have to play with\nthese things and titrate them\nif you decide to use them,\nagain, if you decide to go this route,\nI would not start by taking supplements,\nI would start by getting your\nlight-viewing behavior correct,\nand then think about your nutrition\nand then think about your activity\nand then think about whether\nor not you wanna supplement,\nwe already talked about melatonin earlier.\nThere's another supplement\nthat could be quite useful,\nwhich is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,\nwhich is a derivative of chamomile,\n50 milligrams of apigenin\nalso can augment or support\nthis kind of creation of a sleepiness\nto help fall asleep and stay asleep.\nA note about sleepwalkers and\npeople with very vivid dreams,\ntheanine can often make\nyour dreams very vivid,\nsleepwalkers should be\ncareful about taking theanine,\neveryone should be careful\nabout taking anything,\nand don't take anything\nwithout consulting your\nboard-certified M.D.\nor healthcare professional first, okay?\nYour health is your responsibility,\nI am not gonna take responsibility\nfor what you decide to do\nexperimentally in any case,\nbut especially as it relates\nto supplementation and drugs.\nAs a important point, apigenin\nis a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor,\nso women who want to keep\ntheir estrogen levels high,\nor at whatever levels\nthey happen to be at,\nshould probably avoid apigenin altogether,\nand men, take that into\nconsideration as well,\nmen need estrogen also,\nyou don't wanna completely\neliminate your estrogen,\nthat it can create all\nsorts of bad effects\non libido and cognition, et cetera,\nso apigenin in some people\nis gonna be a pretty\nstrong estrogen inhibitor,\nso keep that in mind.\nThere are other things you can take\nto help you sleep better,\nthose are the legal ones\nthat, at least I'm aware of,\nhave pretty broad safety margins,\nbut again, you need to explore\nyour safety margins with any compound.\nI think a great website\nthat I can refer you to is examine.com,\nexamine, the word, just as it\nsounds, .com, is a website,\nI have no relation to them,\nbut there, you can find links\nto peer-reviewed studies\nfor any compound or supplement,\nas well as some important warnings\nrelated to the things I discussed,\nas well as any other thing\nthat you might decide to supplement with\nor ingest to help improve your sleep.\nOkay, that was a lot of information\nabout how to get better at sleeping,\nfalling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera.\nAn important feature of\nthis podcast, as you know,\nis that we dive deep into topics\nfor several episodes at a time,\nat least a month at a time,\nso by stopping here, I recognize\nthat there are probably\nmany more questions\nthat you still have,\nand the great thing about that\nis that we have another\nepisode coming up soon,\nI'm going to hold office hours\nwhere I'm going to
