    "transcript": "The thing to worry about\nis not when your mentors\nand coaches are pushing you.\nIt's when they stop pushing you\nthat you should really worry\nbecause that means they've\nbasically given up on you.\nSo that always rung in my mind.\nYeah, what I call the person\nwho just is no longer maintaining\nhigh standards for you,\nI call that a protector mindset.\nThat it's almost like, \"it's\ngoing to be too much trouble\nto see you dealing with\nstress from being pushed\nthat I am going to protect\nyou from that stress.\nMaybe I care about you,\nbut I'm not going to knock you down\nor hold you to a high standard.\"\nAnd I see that a lot in coaches,\nI see it in teachers, I see it in parents.\nFor me, the opposite problematic version\nis what I call an enforcer mindset.\nThis is like, \"here's the standard\nand I'm going to hold you to it\nand it's up to you to meet it or not.\""
