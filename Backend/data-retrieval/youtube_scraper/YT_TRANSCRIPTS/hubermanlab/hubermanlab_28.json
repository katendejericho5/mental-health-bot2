    "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman at the Sydney Opera House",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine recently the hubman Lab podcast\nhosted a live event at the Sydney Opera\nHouse in Australia the event was called\nthe brain body contract and featured a\nlecture followed by a question and\nanswer session with the audience we\nwanted to make the question and answer\nsession available to everyone regarding\nregardless if you could attend so what\nfollows is the question and answer\nsession from the Sydney Opera House in\nAustralia I also would like to thank the\nsponsors for the event they are eight\nsleep and ag1 eight sleep makes Smart\nmattress covers with cooling Heating and\nsleep tracking capacity now one of the\nkey aspects to getting a great night's\nsleep is to control the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment and that's\nbecause in order to fall and stay deeply\nasleep your body temperature actually\nhas to drop by about 1 to 3° and in\norder to wake up in the morning feeling\nrefreshed your body temperature actually\nhas to increase by about 1 to 3° eight\nsleep makes it extremely easy to control\nthe temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment at the beginning middle and\nthroughout the night and when you wake\nup in the morning I've been sleeping on\nan eight sleep mattress cover for nearly\n3 years now and it has dramatically\nimproved my sleep if you'd like to try\neight sleep you can go to 8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $150 off their pod 3\ncover eights sleep currently ships to\nthe USA Canada UK select countries in\nthe EU and Australia again that's\n8sleep.com\nhuberman the other live event sponsor\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens and other\ncritical micronutrients I've been taking\nag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted\nthat they decided to sponsor the live\nevent the reason I started taking it and\nthe reason I still take it every day\nonce or twice a day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now of\ncourse I strive to consume healthy Whole\nFoods for the major of my nutritional\nintake every single day but there are a\nnumber of things in ag1 including\nspecific micronutrients that are hard to\nget from Whole Foods or at least in\nsufficient quantities so ag1 allows me\nto get the vitamins and minerals that I\nneed probiotics prebiotics the\nadaptogens and critical micronutrients\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nand you'll get a year supply of vitamin\nD3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com huberman\nthank you to the Sydney Opera House for\nhosting us and for making this event\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\npossible what are the latest findings on\nthe physiological mechanisms behind\nstress's impact on the body and brain\nand what are some practical tools or\ntechniques for managing stress\neffectively well um thank you for that\nquestion I'll I'll um deliberately not\nrepeat what I said earlier about\nphysiological size panoramic Vision Etc\nand raising stress threshold because we\ncovered that um already but I think that\none of the the most interesting findings\ntwo most interesting findings in the in\nthe field of stress in the last five\nyears or even three years I think the\nthe work from my colleague Ali Crum at\nStanford she's been a guest on the\npodcast she works on mindsets uh is the\nfollowing um result uh students Stanford\nstudents that is come into the\nlaboratory they view a I think it's a\nfive minute movie about how awful stress\nis for the mind and body all the things\nit does like deplete your immune system\nmake you miserable uh deplete certain\naspects of the the reproductive axis and\non and on and then a separate group\ncomes in and watches a video also five\nminutes also true about all the things\nthat stress can do to enhance\nperformance both cognitive or physical\nlike excess or additional energy\nadditional cognitive power access to\ncertain memory sets albeit narrow memory\nsets Etc and what you find is that the\nresults Point directly to the fact that\nwhatever you believe about stress\nprovided the information you have is\ntrue is what happens so if I tell you\nthat stress improves your memory Focus\nattention one observes that if I tell\nyou that stress depletes your immune\nsystem Etc one observes that so this is\nsomething that we don't quite yet\nunderstand as neuroscientists and the\npsychology of it makes more sense\nfrankly than the mechanisms but it's\nbecoming very clear that what we believe\nabout a given phenomenon strongly\nimpacts how it shapes our response to\nthat so I find that very\ninteresting now of course you can't\ndelete information about stress being\nbad for you so what does that mean if\nyou want stress to be\nuh enhancing as it's called there's\nliterally now called the stresses\nenhancing mindset that the thing you can\ndo is to learn more about how stress can\nbe enhancing we're not talking about\nlying we're not talking about placebo\neffect we're talking about real\nknowledge based in fact that one can\nabsorb and I find it amazing and\nwonderful that the mere learning of\nsomething can actually change how we\nrespond to something at a core\nphysiological level the second I think\nvery important set of findings on stress\nrelate to a structure that I've talked\nabout recently on the podcast and I\ntalked about with um the one and only\nDavid gogins most people presumably have\nheard like he's on his way he running\nhere right now from from Central America\num yeah that guy I'll tell you that guy\nis every bit as intense as he comes\nacross I met him for the first time in\n2016 at a at a gathering in uh it was in\nSilicon Valley which're just doing a\nlittle bit of work for this company at\nthe end of the day he leaves for minute\nand he changes into his shorts and his\nshirt he's like I'm going running I got\nto go to the airport I'm thinking I'm\ngoing to go running then I'm going to go\nto the airport he was running to the\nairport seriously and we're like 14\nmiles from the airport which I realized\n14 miles for a marathon are no big deal\nbut he's got his\nbags and I'm thinking to myself this guy\nhe's nuts and I love him I mean he's\nreally he's really that guy it's it's\nit's actually very refreshing you know\nthe the Rick you know I think one reason\nwe love the Rick Rubin and the the David\ngoggin is they truly are different but\nfrom one basic standpoint is they just\ndon't give a they just do what\nthey're going to do and they trust that\nthey're doing right for them and for the\npeople around them and it's awesome it's\nreally awesome I think that it it again\nbrings about that you know that word\nthat you know doesn't come about very\noften for me but you just kind of stuns\nyou into like behold David God\nRick rubben the Cuttlefish whatever you\nknow\nso but I talked about this with David\nthere's this structure in our brain and\nthese are recent discoveries not by my\nlab I wish I had discovered these but\nactually a colleague of mine at Stanford\nJoe parvey who's in the department of\nneurosurgery has made these beautiful\ndiscoveries about the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex the anterior mid\nsingulate CeX it's a structure in the\nbrain that has a lot of subdivisions but\nwhen Joe put a little stimulating\nelectrode into this area because he had\npatients that needed neurosurgery and\nthey probe around asking questions what\ndo you feel how do you feel what are you\ngoing to do and sometimes they hit an\narea I've seen these experiments they're\nunbelievable stimulate an area and the\nperson says you know I feel like I'm\nabout to go into a rage they like okay\nlet's back off let's move over here\nanterior mid singulate cortex they\nstimulate and the patient the person\nsays I feel like I'm heading into a\nstorm you go oh that doesn't sound good\nand they say no but I'm ready I'm\nleaning in a different patient you\nstimulate their anterior mid singulate\ncortex and the person says I feel like\nI'm going to get up out of my chair and\ndo something really really difficult\nokay so this is interesting across\nmultiple people you're seeing the same\ngeneral kind of forward Center of mass\nkind of response leaning into Challenge\nand challenge specifically and then\nthere's now scores of studies in the\njust the last 3 to 5 years showing that\nfor instance people who successfully\novercome a challenge of any kind fitness\nchallenge cognitive challenge interior\nmid singulate cortex expands or at least\nincreases its Baseline levels of\nactivity you see people that fail to\nmeet that challenge less inter mid\nsingulate cortex activi there's a\nbidirectionality of the response and on\nand on and it seems that doing things\nthat are difficult that we don't enjoy\nor that we have to push ourselves to\ndo grow and enhance the activity within\nthis anid singulate cortex and the\nbeauty of it is that it generalizes that\nthe anid singulate cortex can be applied\nor the growth of it can be directed\ntowards lots of different things which\nis I think a call for you of course\nseeking pleasure seeking Comfort seeking\nrelaxation seeking sleep every night\nseeking sunlight in the morning Etc but\nalso deliberately seeking out challenges\nthat is challenges for us the importance\nof doing hard things in a safe manner\npsychologically and physically safe\nmanner of course is truly beneficial\ntoward our ability to manage ourselves\nin what would otherwise be called stress\nso I think those the work of alium and\nthe work on the ENT mid singulate cortex\nby parvis and a bunch of other labs I\nthink are the two areas where I um feel\nlike things are happening really quickly\nwe're making big strides as a field and\nwe're moving away from uh kind of\nconjecture about how to U better\nourselves uh in lots of different ways\ncan you talk about time perception why\nis it that in some instances time moves\nvery slowly while in others it seems to\nmove very fast thank you tonight has\nbeen so fun thank\nyou I've had fun too um this is\nsomething I'm trying to do more of not\nnecessarily lives but that too but um\nsomeone recently uh who I I love and\nadmire very much said to me we're gonna\nhave so much fun and I thought whoa like\nbehold no one's ever said that to me no\none's ever said that to me all my years\ngrowing up I I mean I mean I love with\nwith all due respect to my parents I\ncan't remember anyone ever turning to me\nand saying we're going to have so much\nfun so I'm trying that that to me just\nkind of blew me away I'm think yeah like\nyou're allowed to have fun so time\nperception is a topic that I am you know\nas obsessed by as I am many other\ntopics um but one that is really near\nand dear to my heart because I've always\nbeen\nstruck by this observation that is\ncertainly not uniquely mine that you\nknow if you're sitting waiting for an\nappointment at the doctor's office it\nfeels like time goes by really slowly\nlike really\nslowly whereas if you have a really full\nday with lots and lots of activities it\nseems like time went by really fast like\noh my God I can't believe that so much\ntime has G\nby sorry so much has happened excuse me\nbut not a lot of time has gone by which\nmeans that our frame rate on life is\nhighly Dynamic and in fact it is and in\nfact it's set by you guessed it our\nvisual system at least for cited folks\nfor people who are low vision or no\nvision and by the way I I always\nreference that because my laboratory has\nworked on low vision no vision um issues\nfor a number of years it's through the\nauditory system but for sake of\ngeneralizing now and simplicity we'll\ntalk about the visual system so it is a\nfact that when we focus on things up\nclose think of watchmaker think about\nlooking into your phone our perception\nof time is more fine grain that is our\nframe rate is higher okay so more frames\nper second than when we view things at a\ndistance you might think well how could\nthat possibly be how could that possibly\nbe but it makes perfect sense you know\nwhen we think about the time space\ncoding in the brain we need to Anchor\nourselves to something the rising and\nsetting of the sun of course the you\nknow I mean unless you're a flat earther\nyou know we're going around the\nSun now what's that no someone we got no\nflat earthers One Flat earther in the\naudience let okay cool um uh yeah just I\ndon't think that's what they were saying\nbut um but we need to Anchor ourselves\nin time and our visual system is the way\nthat we anchor ourselves in time we have\nfacts about past present and future so\nwe have knowledge but at an unconscious\nlevel we need to Anchor our frame rate\nset our frame rate and so this is why if\nyou go down to Bondi and you lie back\nand you look up at the clouds and the\nclouds are kind of moving in an\nunpredictable way whenever we're looking\nat a landscape which has some lack of\npredictable features like waves or\nrustling of trees where you could\npredict that if the wind's blowing this\nway that the trees going to go this way\nand then back again but you're not not\nreally in a mode of trying to anticipate\njust how far in the same way that for\ninstance if you call an Uber you're\nwaiting on a text message you know if\nyou're ever waiting on a text message\nyou notice you'll F slice okay dot dot\ndot when's that thing coming when's that\nthing you're fine slicing time as your\nlevel of autonomic arousal goes\nup your frame rate goes up as your level\nof autonomic arousal goes down so you're\nsleepy or if you're viewing things that\nhave kind of an\nunpredictable aspect to them then your\nframe rate expands your the passage of\ntime changes or your perception of the\npassage of time changes this is why one\nof the reasons why I love Aquaria you\nknow and one of my favorite things to do\nsince I don't have a fish tank at home\nright now but that's going to change\nsoon is I'll go on YouTube and there's\nthis beautiful live video of this\naquarium in Japan and I'll\njust zone out it's like the most\nrelaxing thing ever and every once in a\nwhile\na whale they have a whale shark in an\naquarium every once in a while a whale\nshark will go through and you go like\nwhoa and then it disappears and then the\nlittle fish and the kelp and things like\nand it's immensely relaxing what it does\nis it slows your frame rate down and\nthen I find that resets me after just\nfive or six minutes to go back to doing\nthis you know High frame rate type stuff\nwhich is what we're doing when we're\ntexting when we're typing when we're\nsocial media by the way is tuned to a\nframe rate that's really interesting\nthat keeps us engaged just up to the\npoint where then we want to swipe to the\nnext thing it's it's the algorithms are\nare designed uh and by the way I have a\nsomewhat benevolent semi benevolent view\nof social media I think it' be used for\ngood I think it' be used for not good um\nI think you know limiting one's time on\nthere is good but there's some there's\nsome good content on there for sure a\nlot of my life is spent on there indeed\nso frame rate is set by where you're\nlooking the further out you're looking\nthe larger the longer sort of time bins\nyour capturing bigger time bins okay\nless resolution closer in and the more\nyou're trying to predict the next\noutcome sort of fine grain analysis\npredicting what we call dpos duration\npath and outcome what's going to happen\nfor how long and what's going to happen\nis something that you're thinking about\nand wondering about then frame rate goes\nup and there's actually a wonderful\nmovie um a Hitchcock movie The Name\nEscapes me at the moment in which\nHitchcock understood this and it's a\nmovie that's only about 90 minutes it's\nlong but in the background the sun rises\nand sets and the way that people move\nthrough the scenes of this movie gives\nyou the Feeling by the end of this\n90-minute movie that a full 24 hours\npassed it's really interesting you feel\nit in your body as if it was a much\nlonger movie even though if you look at\nyour watch that happens and now the\nCannabis smokers again are thinking like\nyeah like where you sit there and you're\nlike whoa that was a really long time\nyou looking it's like three minutes went\nby and you're like whoa like wow\npsychedelics will do this as well um\nthey certainly do they distort our time\nperception mainly through the deployment\nof large amounts of the neuromodulator\nserotonin which is intimately involved\nin kind of clock perception mechanisms\nthere are a bunch of other things that\ncan set sort of in trenic rhythmicity of\nour auditory system that also adjust our\nframe rate I think one of the reasons\nwhy 40 Herz tones can be valuable for\ndoing cognitive work is that they tend\nto entrain the the certain circuits\nwithin the brain for doing the kinds of\nwork that most people call work kind\nwhere you have to type things out think\nlogically kind of if then kind of um\nanalysis very different than say writing\nnew sheet music or coming up with poetry\nwhere you know here again we can think\nback to the you know the Rick Rubin\nthing or the you know being stationary\nright you like the W we're sitting with\nmovement and the Brain going forward\nthere's something about adjusting frame\nrate for capturing new ideas versus\nimplementing ideas implementation of\nideas to be carried out on higher frame\nrate type time perception and now you\ncan understand why our visual perception\nsaid about the distance of a laptop or\nphone would be uh good for that or a\nconversation you know remember that\nwhole thing of like looking at\nsomebody's face and having a\nconversation as opposed to looking off\ninto the distance walking and allowing\none's gaze to go panoramic so hopefully\nnow you're starting to sense some themes\nso that that's all I say about time\nperception now but of course humans have\nthroughout history and still now Frank\nAl um also embarked on a lot of\npharmacology If we're honest in order to\ntry and adjust frame rate for sake of\nproductivity but you know caffeine will\ninjust frame rate in the predictable\nDirection but also things like alcohol\nand and various drugs like you know\ncannabis in order to adjust frame rate\nI'm certainly not suggesting you do\nthose things I'm not a cop you do what\nyou want just know what you're doing can\nyou please talk about the jet lag\nprotocol you followed when arriving in\nSydney oh yeah well this one was a\nlittle bit easier for me because\nobviously it's not that far off it's\njust you're a full day ahead uh from\nwhere I live back home in California um\nbut nonetheless I suffered tremendously\nfrom jet lag and once actually in 2017 I\nwent to Abu Dhabi a 12-hour flip from uh\nwhere I was living at that time in the\nBay Area and I was a wreck I could\nbarely make it to the meeting I was\ncrying I was like it really messes me up\nI I slept great the first night and then\njust didn't sleep for two days I was a\nmess so jet lag is something that I've\nreally had to work hard on and there are\na couple things worth noting and we've\ndone a whole episode about this but I'll\nkind of hit a few key bullet points and\nmaybe it's relevant to you even if\nyou're not traveling at any point soon\nbecause many people are jetlagged\nwithout traveling because of the way\nthat they stay up late in fact most\neverybody in the world now qualifies as\na shift worker did you know that and\nhere no disrespect only reverence and\ngratitude to the actual shift workers\nthat stay up all night doing emergency\nwork and Hospital work and caring for\nchildren and things like that throughout\nthe night so I'm not trying to take\nanything away from them but we are all\nshifted Enough by virtue of artificial\nlighting and and uh electronic devices\nthat we are effectively shifted and\nshift working because we're staying up\nengaging our cognitive systems in ways\nthat frankly we didn't evolve to which\nI'm not saying is bad but it's just the\nreality okay what to do for jet lag the\nkey thing is this and actually this is\nvery valuable in general for sake of\nsleep so this is something I haven't\ntalked enough about on the\npodcast ask yourself what time you\nnormally wake up without an alarm I\nrealize there's some variance from dayto\nday but you know for me it would be\nabout let's say 6:00 a.m. so let's say\nfor you at 7 you know just get pick your\ntypical wakeup time if you subtract from\nthat number so for me 4:\na.m. that almost with certainty is\nwhat's called your temperature minimum\nyour temperature minimum we could\nmeasure it you could put a thermometer\nin your mouth or if you come to the\nlaboratory Unfortunately they have to do\nit rectally 4:00 a.m. would be my\ntemperature minimum maybe for you if you\nwake up at 7 typically or around 7 it's\ngoing to be 500 a.m. okay so we're not\nactually measuring your temperature in\nthis kind of Gunk and this thought\nexperiment what we're doing is we're\ntrying to find a time so here's what's\ninteresting if you expose your eyes not\nyour skin but your eyes to Bright Light\nin the 2 hours or\nso maybe 3 hours prior to that\ntemperature minimum time so if you wake\nup at 7: a.m. 5 a.m. is your temperature\nminimum so in the two hours maybe three\nhours prior to that you're going to\nshift your wakeup time and your toed\ntime what's called a phase delay a shift\nin your circadian rhythm by about an\nhour\ninteresting given that if you view\nbright light in the two to three hours\nafter your temperature minimum you\nadvance your clock meaning you pull back\nyour clock to want to wake up a bit\nearlier and go to sleep a little bit\nearlier by about an hour for every time\nyou do that you think well okay I wake\nup in the morning at 7 and let's say I'm\nusing you as an example or me at 6 and I\nusually\ntry and get some sunlight in my eyes\nespecially on overcast days etc etc\nyou've heard me blab about this many\ntimes before on the podcast and\nelsewhere so how come I'm not going to\nbed earlier and earlier every night and\nwaking up earlier and earlier every\nmorning and indeed you would you would\nkeep phase advancing your clock if you\ndid that except that in the afternoon if\nyou got sunlight in your eyes as\npresumably you did today it was\nbeautiful sunny day on your way here you\nphase delayed your clock a little bit\nand as a consequence you wake up and go\nto sleep at more or less the same time\nevery day it's an amazing mechanism and\nguess what viewing sunlight in the\nmiddle of the day does not do the same\nthing it doesn't shift your circadian\nclock they don't tell you that in school\nbut they should they're telling you like\nall the other\nstuff the reason it doesn't do it is\nthat middle of the day period is What's\ncalled the Circadian Dead Zone sounds\nvery dramatic very ominous getting\nsunlight in your eyes during the middle\nof the day is great for mood it's\nevident that it's also important if it\ngets on your skin and healthy not\nburning amounts uh levels that would\ninduce burn that it can enhance\ntestosterone estrogen levels Etc in\nhealthy ways healthy ratios nonetheless\nthat morning sunlight viewing after your\ntemperature minimum advances your clock\nmakes you want to get up earlier go to\nbed earlier viewed before delays your\nclock makes you want to get up later go\nto bed later so this is very useful if\nyou ever want to shift your clock at\nhome before you Trav to get onto a new\nschedule for work or school or if you're\ntraveling what it means is that when you\narrive in a new location like I did in\nMelbourne the other day believe me I\npracticed that for like at least an hour\nyou know and with two aies and they kept\ntelling me I was doing it wrong until\nfinally they're like no I'm just joking\nwith you you got it right like the\nfourth time you guys have a wicked sense\nof humor down\nhere\nthe I'm tougher than I look the the the\nkey thing is\nthat if you land you have to ask let's\nsay at 8:00 a.m. local or noon local\ntime the key is to ask yourself hm what\ndoes my body\nthink what is my temperature minimum\nback from back home so for instance if\nyou land at 5:00 p.m. but it corresponds\nto a time before your temperature\nminimum and you go outside and you're\nlike w W beautiful Setting\nSun I'm supposed to get sunlight in my\neyes well guess what you might delay\nyour clock if you want to go to bed\nearlier that's probably not a good idea\nwhereas if you want to stay if you want\nto advance your clock you would view\nsunlight at a time that is corresponding\nto the two hours after your temperature\nminimum I realize it's a little bit\ntricky but that's all you have to ask\nyourself for the first three days first\nthree days that you travel to some\nlocation because then you can shift very\nfast so what that requires is sometimes\nsaying oh I don't want to shift myself\nso I'm actually going to wear sunglasses\nand a brimmed hat to avoid shifting\nbecause I'd like to be on the local\nschedule or in some cases you think oh I\nreally want to wake up here and I'm in\nthe perfect opportunity to wake up\nbecause it's the middle of the afternoon\nin Sydney and back home I would have\njust hit my temperature minimum and so\nI'm going to get sunlight in my eyes\nwell that's going to wake me up and it's\ngoing to actually make me want to go to\nbed a little bit earlier so I can go to\nbed at local time so I'm not going to be\nup until you know 3:00 a.m. so you might\nhave to work this out a little bit on\npaper but this is the way that military\nand this is the way that shift workers\nwho are educated in the in the\nmechanisms of this stuff that's the way\nthey do it it also helps to eat on the\nlocal schedule because food is another\nwhat we call zeit Gaber another one of\nthe timekeepers for the circadian clock\nso if you force yourself to eat on the\nlocal schedule that can help you shift\nactivity can help you shift and social\nrhythms can help you shift as well but\nthat temperature minimum and the role of\nlight before or after the temperature\nminimum either delaying or advancing\nyour clock that's the heavy hammer in\nthis whole process so I did that and\nthese days I do a lot of red light time\nin the evening when I want to go to\nsleep and I don't mean red light panels\nlike the expensive stuff that has a\nwhole other set of uses what I'm talking\nabout is just getting a red light like a\nparty light we turn off the lights and\nput in a red light and that is known to\nreduce cortisol levels as opposed to\nother kinds of lighting so it only takes\nabout half hour before you go to sleep\nor so you want to mellow out you just\nswitch over to Red Light it's actually\nvery pleasant right um as long as you\ncan go about the activities you want to\ndo safely just you know get a you put a\nred light up and by the way Rick's house\nis like all red lights at night no\nartificial lighting past Sundown guys\nlike a plant can you elaborate on the\nscience between psychedelic psilocybin\nand\nneuroplasticity uh yes um you know this\nis a topic that just a few years ago I\nwas was like too frightened to talk\nabout um I was afraid to lose my job\nfrankly um\nyou know these are still scheduled drugs\nin the United States although they are\nbeing explored for therapeutic reasons\nmainly for the treatment of uh severe\ndepression but among among other things\nsmoking sensation Eating Disorders by\nthe way anoria nervosa still is the the\nthe highest morbidity of any psychiatric\nchallenge it's just really tragic so you\nknow like there there's a real need for\ntreatments that work and um psychedelics\nlike psilocybin LSD to some extent um\nMDMA which uh technically is not a\npsychedelic it's an empathogen we could\ntalk about that also called ecstasy um\nso uh these sorts of compounds are have\nbeen explored quite extensively in the\nlast few years and I've completely\nramped my stance on them for for a\ncouple of reasons I'll just come clean\nyou know as as a kid um too young I I\nexplored these things I do not recommend\nthat uh I had some pretty bad\nexperiences on LSD as as a young\nteenager\num and I don't recommend it I think the\nbrain is highly plastic that time in\nfact being an adolescent a kid or a teen\nis a psychedelic\nexperience you do not need psychedelics\nand I don't recommend them um unless\nsome very qualified clinician you know\ncan convince you otherwise I you know\nand there I would also you know seek a\nsecond opinion but they they clearly\nhave their role and I think a couple of\nthings have changed my stance first of\nall there are a lot of ferally funded\nstud studies taking place at Stanford\nand Elsewhere on these compounds um\nsecond they for whatever reason and I\ndon't quite understand the sociology of\nit but for whatever reason psychedelics\nare no\nlonger uh associated with the kind of\ncounterculture the way they used to be\nand are in fact heavily associated with\nsome of the veterans groups that are\nusing these for PTSD with groups in the\nstates groups like veteran Solutions\nwhich are doing amazing work with\ndifferent psychedelics in including\nibigan um iboga it's a 22-hour long\npsychedelic Journey I've never done it\num truly where you close your eyes and\nand you get um essentially real life\nlike recollection of your experiences\nbut you have agency inside these\nexperiences um there's some cardiac\nissues with abigan that require constant\nmonitoring of the of the heart but\nthey're they've got some really\nimpressive outcomes this is all worked\nby my colleague Nolan Williams at\nStanford so things like psilocybin we\nview a little bit differently nowadays\nwhat is psilocybin\npsilocybin if you look at it chemically\nlooks a lot like\nserotonin a lot like serotonin and it\ntickles that is it binds nearly\nselectively to a specific serotonin\nreceptor and it seems to create more\nwhat we call resting state lateral\nconnectivity which means more brain\nareas connected to other brain areas or\nat least talking to those brain areas\nafter the psilocybin Journey as it's\ncalled as opposed to before now\nthese Journeys and I have done them as\nan adult um I did this as part of a\nclinical trial did was participated in a\npsilocybin trial and I participated in\nMDMA\ntrial um they can be terrifying while\nthey're happening but often there's\ngreat Insight um from those experiences\nprovided the right support is provided\nand it's they always say set and setting\nso I'm not providing all these like\ncaveats about safety for for no reason\nor to protect me I'm saying to protect\nyou I mean it it can be it was for me\nabsolutely terrifying and then you do it\nagain as part of these trials the second\ntime I'm like okay this time moment is\ngoing to be good going boom terrifying\nit was a horrible but I learned a lot\nand there does seem to be an\nanti-depressant effect I wasn't\nclinically diagnosed with depression but\nprior to that but or after thank\ngoodness\nbut I think what we're seeing with these\ncompounds and from my own experience if\nI may is\nthat they allow us to see relationships\nbetween events of\npast and present and hopefully\nanticipate certain actions and changes\ninto the future while experiencing the\nfullness of the emotionality of those\nexperiences in real time so as somebody\nwho's done an immense amount of therapy\num I can tell you that I I find Great\nValue in talk therapy I do um especially\nof the I think what's called Insight\noriented psychoanalysis or or\nPsychotherapy doesn't have to be classic\npsychoanalysis not just support you need\nthat not just Rapport you need that but\ninsight as well is is the goal those\nthree things but one of the issues is\nunless you get on the phone with your\ntherapist or you talk to them in person\nin a moment where something is really\nacute like it's really getting you right\nat that moment sad or happy or whatever\nit may\nbe it's hard to experience the fullness\nof that issue in that moment while also\nparsing it cognitively and it does seem\nthat the psychedelics and to some extent\nMDMA allow people to get into the full\namplitude maybe even enhanced amplitude\nemotionality of an experience and at the\nsame time allow people to reflect and\nwith the help of a so-called guide or\nthe the\ntherapist take notes in a way that lead\nto specific actionable outcomes and I\nthink that's the real value you can get\nrealtime experience with insight and of\ncourse you need need support as well and\nof course set and setting and safety are\nabsolutely key so psilocybin seems to do\nthat in one manner MDMA does it in a\ndifferent way MDMA by the way we we know\ndramatically increases serotonin and\ndopamine but it seems to be the\nserotonergic effect that um is\nresponsible for most of its therapeutic\neffect by the way MDMA is methylene\ndioxy methampetamine which isn't\nnecessarily saying that it's bad what's\nactually interesting is that\nMDMA ecstasy provided that it's pure and\nin the appropriate dosage range does not\nseem to be neurotoxic as it once was\nthought to be the paper claiming that\nwas retracted they accidentally were\ngiving the subjects in that study uh\nBeth amphetamine not MDMA and right yes\nright and they retracted the paper but\nnobody talks about that paper but do you\nknow it's kind of interesting do you\nknow where the um most of the data on\nthe lack of toxicity of MDMA comes from\nthere's a a beautiful set of studies\nthat were carried out on subjects who\nwere exclusively from the church of\nlatterday saints sometimes referred to\nas Mormons right Mormons are an\nexcellent test population for a study\nlike that because they don't do other\ndrugs but MDMA is not on the no-fly list\nso apparently according to these papers\nand by the way I have a lot of friends\nwho are LDS and they're they're\nwonderful people the according to the\nthese papers which I believe because\nthey're published and peer reviewed and\nthey still are in the literature you can\nfind subjects in that Community not all\nof LDS are taking LDS folks are taking\nactually I don't think but presumably no\nbut people who have taken anywhere from\none to two to 50 to over a 100 doses of\nMDMA in a short period of time and aside\nfrom a mild deficit in in attention and\nthe people who have taken the large\ndoses or frequent doses that is they\nthere do not seem to be many cognitive\ndeficits um that are detectable and\ncertainly no um apparent neurotoxicity\nwhich is not to say go do MDMA as much\nas you like I think there is the\npotential for neurotoxicity if it's\ntaken too often and things of that sort\nso a lot to still figure out but MDMA um\nseems to have a slightly different um\ntrajectory of than psilocybin it tends\nto be less um scary um although it it is\nvery sympathetic uh arousing that is so\npeople can get afraid or if the elevated\nheart rate Etc but the empathogenic\ncomponent is really interesting because\nultimately with PTSD it's really about\ndeveloping empathy for one's self it's\nreally about developing empathy for\noneself and resolving one of the core\nissues of trauma which is often not\ndiscussed which is that at an\nunconscious level at an unconscious\nlevel trauma seems to be a confusion to\nthe nervous system about who's\nresponsible so that even if somebody\nknows and understands hey that was them\nthey're the perpetrator I'm the\nvictim somehow the nervous system gets\nconfused about responsibility in a way\nthat leads to triggering of some of the\nthe negative feelings around that event\nor events as the case may be and MDMA\nseems to be able to intervene in that\nconfusion and shortcircuit that\nconfusion through this self-empathy\nself-empathy is something that I think\num deserves more exploration in the\nyears to come so lots happening there in\nthe United States MDMA is um now being\nregistered with the FDA for um for\nadditional perhaps for legalization\nright now it's it is still illegal so if\nyou take any of what I said tonight and\ngo buy MDMA I'm not at fault okay\ngetting in the sa about two hours before\ngoing to sleep really improves my\nquality of sleep what's going on here ah\nlove this this one can be pretty simple\nthe relationship between temperature and\nsleep is a wellestablished one to fall\nasleep you need to cool down by 1 to 3\ndegre you've probably heard me say that\nbefore to wake up you need to heat up by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees and when you get\ninto a sauna or you take a hot bath or\neven to a lesser degree you wash your\nface with warm water in the evening\nhands with warm water because of the way\nthat the body Thermo\nregulates you actually end up cooling\nyourself off you think no I got in the\nsauna actually I've been going to the\nsauna at this place here um recovery\nthey have a wonderful sauna coal plune\nand then they have this bed where you\nfloat on the thing have you tried this\nthing this thing is so cool it's like a\nwater bed but it like floats you that's\namazing amazing by the way they don't\npay me to say that I'm just grateful\nthat they let me like sit in this bed\nI've was sleeping in there as much as\npossible but they shut down at night\neventually and I got to go home so the\nthe sauna is a great tool before sleep\nor or warm shower or hot bath or warm\nbath for the following reason the brain\narea that controls Thermo regulation is\nthe medial preoptic area which is\noperates like a thermostat so if you\nwarm the external portion of the body\nthe brain has to then what cool down\nyour core body temperature it doesn't\nhappen right away but it happens as you\nget out of the sauna and maybe you take\na a warmish shower or cool shower so\nwhat ends up happening is that you\nwarmed up which allows you to cool down\ninternally and then you're able to fall\nasleep and stay more deeply asleep um\nthat's probably what's improving your\nsleep in fact a kind of Mantra that I\nlearned from the great Matt Walker who\nwrote The Great Book why we sleep and by\nthe way we have a sleep series with the\nmighty Matt Walker coming out later this\nyear we recorded six episodes all every\naspect of sleep you can\nimagine he says and I hope I'm getting\nthis right uh he says you need to warm\nup to cool down to go to sleep or to\nfall warm up to cool down to fall asleep\nstay cool to stay asleep warm up to wake\nup there you go that's a a straight bite\nout of uh Matt Walker's um mouth so he\ndeserves that um citation not me so\nthat's what's happening when you get in\nthe sauna now when you get into the cold\nplunge you're cold but guess what same\nthing the surface of your body is cooler\nthose thermal receptors transmit\ninformation to the medial preoptic area\nof your body and your core body\ntemperature eventually goes up provided\nyou don't stay in there get hypothermic\nof course okay people are always asking\nme I have a good friend um who uh just\nso happens to be straight edged he's\nlike never never even has sip of\ncaffeine I I don't know it's a good\nthing because he's extreme and I he got\na cold plunge and he went in for a\nminute and then the next day he's like I\ndid three minutes and then pretty soon\nhe's like hey Al I got a I got a sick I\nwas like what do you do he's like I got\nnaked in the cold plunge for 45 minutes\nI was like well listen you know I'm like\nfirst of all thank goodness you don't do\ndrugs and second of all like Easy Does\nIt Easy Does It that the cold cold is a\nvery powerful stimulus as is heat so you\nknow you you know minimal effective dose\nyou know you could have some fun with it\nbut don't go wild I I still don't know\nwhy you got in there naked but who knows\nif we expose ourselves to the same\nstress over and over again do we release\nthe same amount of adrenaline and its\npositive negative impact and just\nbecomes less receptive do we release\nless adrenaline and hence it's less\nharmful it's a great question depends on\nthe context typically you'd release less\nand less adrenaline and actually this\nrelates to a really important fact about\nthe the ever famous structure of the\namydala which means almond\nI don't know why I told you that the um\nhappens to be shaped like an almond the\namydala um people associated with threat\ndetection in danger but it's actually a\nnovelty detector essentially and it's\ninvolved with a bunch of other brain\ncircuits that anytime we experience\nsomething novel you know uh we have a\nelevated level of autonomic arousal like\nearlier tonight before the show there\nwas a kind of a\nrepeating and the first time I happened\nI'm like fire alarm like what's going on\nby the time it happened five times I was\nkind of like so that's sort if we I'd be\nwilling to bet both amigdalas that had\nwe recorded from my amigdalas he got one\non each side of the brain you would find\nthat that the first time was a big\nincrease in activity lesser second third\nfourth fifth and you attenuate you\nhabituate so if if the stressor is one\nin which you don't care it doesn't have\nmuch relevance to you like that alarm um\nprobably less and less adrenaline I'd be\nwilling to bet however if with each\nsubsequent exposure like somebody you\nreally can't stand or something like\nthat it's decreasing your life\nsatisfaction and increasing your level\nof cognitive or psychological stress\nthen it would go in the opposite\ndirection I think that's that's fair to\nsay hey hey Andrew I like that I like\nthat I like hey that's cool yeah the\nother day it was really interesting\nevery once in a while someone walk up\nand be like hey listen to the podcast\nwhich is always nice it's always nice to\nmeet people and this kid walks up to me\nthis was in Melbourne in the in the gym\nlike this has never happened to me\nbefore it was really cool he just walks\nup he goes hey Andrew I'm like cool like\nhe just said that's it and he just\nwalked away I was like right like I like\ncool and I was like that kid is so\nmellow it was really cool like I was\nlike we would have been friends actually\nfriends with all the wild ones but it\nwas a really interesting phenotype again\nhuman phenotypes fascinate me so if we\nrun into each other on the street and I\nask your name and we talk I'm genuinely\ninterested I'm not studying you I'm not\ntaking notes or data but people are so\ndifferent but hey Andrew okay so maybe\nit's\nhim hey Andrew hey\naie I found that I'm able to focus far\nbetter when I bounce my legs up and down\nwhile sitting on the balls of my feet\nwhat's going on you got a lot of energy\nthat's what's going on no I think you\nknow um there isn't a ton of science on\nthis but it's very clear as I mentioned\nearlier that people have different um\nspontaneous movement rates and some\npeople people you know some people are a\nlittle bit more jittery um if you look\nif you go into a uh a classroom of young\nchildren see them sitting around boys\nand girls let's say somewhere between 4\nand\n6 often times you'll notice that some of\nthe kids can sit extremely still and\nthen some of the kids are like really\nlike and there is a chromosomal\ndifference there the boy it's known that\nthat boys have a slower\ndevelopment of the so-call top down\ninhibition from the forbrain that the\nprefrontal cortex which frankly we hear\nabout over and over again many podcasts\na lot of description of prefrontal\nCortex its main job the best description\nI've ever heard of it anyway is from a\nfriend who's a neurosurgeon at neurolink\nwho came up through my lab Matt\nMcDougall he's been on the podcast he\nthe the job of the prefrontal cortex is\nto send connections to the rest of the\nbrain and\nsay basically to the appropriate circuit\nso it's that's why people of the pre\nwith damage to the prefrontal cortex for\nany reason or degeneration of the\nprefrontal cortex find themselves doing\nthings or we find them doing things that\nare a little bit context inappropriate\nand in some cases dramatically\ninappropriate but in most cases just\nkind of context inappropriate they don't\nsuppress Behavior very well so you know\nit may be that a certain level of\nautonomic arousal brings us into that\noptimal you know some people call it a\nflow State a flow state is a little bit\nof a nebulous thing I mean I have great\nrespect for Steven Cotler and those that\nhave talked about and written about flow\nbut what I really can just say about\nflow as it relates to Neuroscience is\nthat like backwards that spells wolf\nlike we don't really know that much more\nabout like the neural basis of a flow\nstate but for each of us we have these\nkind of tunnels that we like to be in um\nwhere we find that our level of focus\nand action is just right and so I I I\ndon't think I'm going too far out on a\nlimb here how you by saying that if you\nif you find that you focus best when you\ncan dispel a little bit of that um\nenergy by moving your body that you're\nable to do your your best work that\nmakes sense to me I I don't do them so\nmuch anymore but for years I would do\nyou know surgeries lots and lots of\nsurgeries down the microscope dissecting\nretinas dissecting retinas like if you\ngot an eyeball I can dissect it I'm good\nat it um I can do them in my sleep and I\nwould find that if I had a little bit\ntoo much energy that the forceps would\njiggle a little bit and it wasn't a\ncaffeine thing and a friend of mine\nwho's a worldclass neurosurgeon Eddie\nChang is chair neurosurgery at UCSF he's\nbeen on the podcast he said ah there's a\nsolution to that that we learn in\nneurosurgery they're like the astronauts\nof medicine he said you know you tap\nyour foot I thought oh that's kind of\ncool why would that work he said well\nbasically you've got some sort of\nanticipatory activity in an area of the\nbrain called the basil ganglia which is\ninvolved in these go noo type actions\nlike all of our actions are yes go and\nnoo don't do something else so flexor\nextensor this all kind of stuff very\ncomplicated but seamless for most most\npeople and when you have a bit too much\nanticipatory activity you're getting\nready to go like a like a sprinter out\nthe blocks and you're you know you're\ndoing something that's very important\nlike a brain surgery in his case or you\nknow microsurgery in my case for\nresearch purposes that if you your\nactivation state is too high that you\ncan dispel some of that energy by just\nsimply tapping your foot or doing some\nsort of rhythmic activity with another\npart of your body appropriate to that\ncontext of course\nokay last question don't\nknow hey Andrew yeah oh oh they skipped\nthat one I guess that's the new thing\nI'll never forget when I got my lab for\nthe first time you know I came up in an\nera when it was still pretty formal\nNeuroscience you like you'd say hey\nprofessor so and so and then they say\nyou can call me Barbara and I'm like hey\nBarbara but before that no one you know\nneed hey or that and I'll never forget\nthat in my lab one my first graduate\nstudent who's now a professor he's very\nvery talented scientist at the\nUniversity of Utah and I got a text from\nhim that just said\nshe called me Andy she said hey Andy\nwhen are you going to buy us an espresso\nmaker it was like the second day and I\nwas like whoa times have changed so I\nthink it's good I think the lack of\nformality is actually good at first I\nwas like wait a second I waited my whole\nlife to become a professor and now it's\nhey Andy but I think you know W with\nwith the years I've realized that it's\nit's actually kind of nice I'm 17 years\nold congratulations man I wish I you\ndidn't want to know me when I well I was\na nice kid but I was just had a lot of\nconfusion I'm 17 years old so you're in\na psychedelic experience of Youth what\nis your biggest advice on finding your\npassion oh\nwell goodness gracious I think you you\nknow I if I'm honest I I think we talked\nabout a little bit earlier I think your\npassion is rooted in a feeling\nstate that you've already accessed\nhopefully many times but at least one\ntime earlier in your life when for\nwhatever reason or circumstances you\nweren't thinking about what your parents\nwanted you to do what was cool or not\ncool in school you were in a pure\nfeeling\nstate\nof\nyum that's really\ncool\nbehold and so I can't answer the\nquestion for you but I'll tell you yes\ncontinue to forage I do believe that\nlearning is among the most wonderful\nthings that we can do for ourselves but\nthat if you spend some time in your\nmemory banks that you'll be able to\nremember a feeling and maybe the feeling\nwas about a board game you played or or\nsomething you\nobserved or maybe it just came about\nthrough some other activity and the\nfeeling is unrelated to the activity\nthat's where it gets a little tricky and\nwe're answering this question for a\n17-year-old but it's true for all of us\nthis is where it gets a little trick is\nthat sometimes we think it's the\nactivity but it's not the activity I\nmean Lord knows I stay out of the\nAquarius stores these days you know\nbecause if I go near one it's all over\nno it's it's that it's the it's the\nDelight in something that is very\npersonal in fact I think is very unique\nto you to the extent that and I do\nbelieve this that it's not capable of\nbeing created by anybody else and that\nfeedback from other people about what we\nshould do or what we're good at while it\ncan be\nuseful it's merely a calibration point\nfor saying like someone says maybe you\nshould do this and you go or like me or\nlike yuck those are all just calibration\npoints on this like Compass to take you\nback to that feeling state so I\napologize for not having a more concrete\nmechanistic works the first time works\nevery time uh kind of you know instant\ntool like a physiological\nsigh rather this this is going to have\nto be some self- exloration but the good\nnews is you're 17 your brain's still\nplastic the good news is all of us are\ncapable of neurop plasticy throughout\nthe lifespan and the good news is all of\nus are capable of introspection\nthroughout the lifespan so even if you\ncan't remember you can sense and if you\ncan sense what you're doing is you're\nfeeling what what is this I don't want\nto turn this into a neuroscience lesson\nbut I'd be remiss if I didn't say that\nyou're perceiving and feeling on the\nbasis of\nconverting physical information in your\nenvironment sound waves\nphotons mechanical pressure chemicals\ngoing in through your nose and mouth\nyou're converting that into electrical\nand chemical signals that's what being\nand perceiving it really is it can't be\nanything else so there's something about\nthe way that you're\nwired Oscar that is\ndifferent and leads you to say yum yeah\nyeah yeah yeah that that that and for me\nI've always associated with a certain\nphysical sensation in this arm don't ask\nme why I don't even know and if you can\nsense into what it is that gets you\ngoing in that direction if any and all\nof us do that then I really believe you\ncan sense into your unique gifts or\nmaybe you just need to sit back and\nthink in deliberate complete sentences\nfor an hour like Rick or one of those\nother Geniuses I don't have a better\nanswer that's the best I can do thanks\nso much\nyeah thank you than you so\nmuch thank you thanks so\nmuch thank you thank you thank you so\nmuch so just as a as a final um note\nthis evening I just want to thank\neveryone for coming out as Rob mentioned\nto you know come out as far as I know\nthere's no alcohol here people are here\namazing um an event with no alcohol on a\nSaturday night in this beautiful Sydney\nsummer and where we talk science um\nthanks for letting me tell some stories\nlearn some stories my my real wish my\ndeep wish is that everyone do some level\nof introspection if not tonight in going\nforward and um I so appreciate that\npeople are interested in the concepts\naround science and health and and the\nthe real big big Wish For Me Maybe I'll\neven just call it an ask is that I truly\ndon't develop the protocols I I I mind\nthem occasionally I develop them but I\nmine them from the the rich sources of\nyou know information in papers and and\nelsewhere and um put them into a format\nthat I'm I'm deeply appreciative people\nuh enjoy digesting and hopefully apply\nbut hopefully share and I certainly\ndon't need attribution none of them are\nnamed after me intentionally because um\nthat's not going to give any information\nabout what they do or how they work and\nlast but certainly not least thank you\nfor your interest in\nscience thank you to the Sydney Opera\nHouse trust for their hospitality and\nfor making this event possible and last\nbut certainly not least thank you for\nyour interest in science\n[Music]"
