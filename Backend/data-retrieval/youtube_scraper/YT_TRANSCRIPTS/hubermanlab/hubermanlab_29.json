    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the hubman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today March the 3D episode in\nour sixth episode series all about sleep\nwith expert guest Dr Matthew Walker\nduring today's episode we discuss how to\nstructure your sleep for optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwe discuss monophasic sleep schedules\nwhich are the more typical sleep\nschedule where you go to sleep at night\nand then wake up in the morning so\nsleeping in one bout as opposed to\npolyphasic sleep schedules which are\nwhen you sleep in two or more bouts\neither at night or perhaps a shorter\nbout of sleep at night and another bout\nof sleep during the day we also discuss\nnaps including how to nap how long your\nnap should be whether or not naps are\ngood or bad in particular whether or not\nthey're good or bad for you it turns out\nthis varies according to individual we\nalso discuss how your needs for sleep\nand naps vary across the lifespan and we\ndiscuss body position during sleep which\nmight seem excessively detailed but it\nturns out that body position during\nsleep is critical for ensuring that the\nsleep you get is optimally restorative\nas with the first two episodes of this\nsix episode series today's third episode\nis filled with both science that is the\nbiology of sleep and napping and body\nposition and how those relate to one\nanother as well as practical tools that\nyou can use to vastly improve your sleep\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is betterhelp\nbetterhelp offers Professional Therapy\nwith a licensed therapist carried out\nonline now I've been doing therapy for\nwell over 30 years initially I had to do\ntherapy against my will but of course I\ncontinued to do it voluntarily over time\nbecause I really believe that doing\nregular therapy with a quality therapist\nis one of the best things that we can do\nfor our mental health indeed for many\npeople it's as beneficial as getting\nregular physical exercise the great\nthing about better help is that it makes\nit very easy to find a therapist that's\noptimal for your needs and I think it's\nfair to say that we can define a great\ntherapist as somebody with whom you have\nexcellent Rapport somebody with whom you\ncan talk about a variety of different\nissues and who can provide you not just\nsupport but also insight and with better\nhelp they make it extremely conven vent\nso that it's matched to your schedule\nand other aspects of your life if you'd\nlike to try betterhelp you can go to\nbetterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off\nyour first month again that's\nbetterhelp.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans plenty of the electrolytes\nmagnesium potassium and sodium and no\nsugar as I mentioned before on this\npodcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want\nto be clear people who already consume a\nlot of salt or who have high blood\npressure or who happen to consume a lot\nof processed foods that typically\ncontain salt need to control their salt\nintake however if you're somebody who\neats pretty clean and you're somebody\nwho exercises and you're drinking a lot\nof water there's a decent chance that\nyou could benefit from ingesting more\nelectrolytes with your liquids the\nreason for that is that all the cells in\nour body including the nerve cells the\nneurons require the electrolytes in\norder to function properly so we don't\njust want to be hydrated we want to be\nhydrated with proper electrolyte levels\nwith element that's very easy to do what\nI do is when I wake up in the morning I\nconsume about 16 to 32 ounces of water\nand I'll dissolve a packet of element in\nthat water I'll also do the same when I\nexercise especially if it's on a hot day\nand I'm sweating a lot and sometimes\nI'll even have a third element packet\ndissolved in water if I'm exercising\nreally hard or sweating a lot or if I\njust noticed that I'm not consuming\nenough salt with my food if you'd like\nto try element you can go to drink\nelement spelled LM nt.com huberman to\nclaim a free element sample pack with\nyour purchase again that's drink element\nLM\nt.com today's episode is also brought To\nUs by waking up waking up is a\nmeditation app that has hundreds of\ndifferent meditations as well as scripts\nfor Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deep rest\nor nsdr protocols by now there's an\nabundance of data showing that even\nshort daily meditations can greatly\nimprove our mood reduce anxiety improve\nour ability to focus and can improve our\nmemory and while there are many\ndifferent forms of meditation most\npeople find it difficult to find and\nstick to a meditation practice in a way\nthat is most beneficial for them the\nwaking up app makes it extremely easy to\nlearn how to meditate and to carry out\nyour daily meditation practice in a way\nthat's going to be most effective and\nefficient for you it includes a variety\nof different types of meditations of\ndifferent duration as well as things\nlike Yoga Nidra which place the brain\nand body into a sort of pseudo sleep\nthat allows you to emerge feeling\nincredibly mentally refreshed in fact\nthe science around Yoga Nidra is really\nimpressive showing that after a yoga\nneedra session levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhanced\nby up to 60% which places the brain and\nbody into a state of enhanced Readiness\nfor mental work and for physical work\nanother thing I really like about the\nwaking up app is that it provides a\n30-day introduction course so for those\nof you that have not meditated before or\ngetting back to a meditation practice\nthat's fantastic or if you're somebody\nwho's already a skilled and regular\nmeditator waking up has more advanced\nmeditations and yoga needer sessions for\nyou as well if you'd like to try The\nWaking Up app you can go to waking\nup.com huberman and access a free 30-day\ntrial again that's waking up.com\nhuberman and now for my conversation\nwith Dr Matthew Walker Dr Walker welcome\nback Dr huberman an absolute pleasure\nlet's talk about the different types of\nsleep because I think most people think\nof sleep as just one thing most people\nsleep at night some people also nap a\ntopic we'll also discuss today\nbut turns out there are a lot of\ndifferent different types of sleep what\nare the different types of sleep and\nwhat do they do for us and um I guess\neveryone's probably wondering already I\ncertainly am what types of sleep are we\nalready engaging in meaning am I\ninvolved in or having multiple types of\nsleep each night this is a fascinating\nquestion and it comes back to something\nwe've discussed in a previous episode\nthe different stages of sleep and how\nthey unfold we've described that\nfascinating stuff what you're already\nasking though is is an incredibly sort\nof subtle but relevant question how\nshould I be sleeping in terms of the\nphases of sleep should I have one phase\nshould I have two phases of sleep or\nshould I have many phases of sleep in\nsome ways you can answer that question\non the basis of the lifespan because how\nit is that we sleep in terms of those\nchunking sessions changes as we\ndevelop to be clear in\nnomenclature I'm saying monophasic basic\npolyphasic unpack that monophasic\nobviously just simply means a single\nphase monophasic when you say phase you\nmean one bout of sleep correct so that\nwould be within a 24-hour period you are\nhaving a single bout of sleep basic then\nmeans that within that 24-hour phase you\nare having two bouts of sleep and we'll\nspeak about how those bouts are split up\nare they split up between two halves in\nthe middle of the night or are they\nsplit up in terms of longer at night\nSiesta like nap in the afternoon and\nthen we can speak about polyphasic sleep\npolyphasic sleep we in sleep science\nhave been using for many years in the\ncontext of infancy because there as any\nnew parents will know infants do not\njust simply have a nice single bout of\nsleep they're up they're down they're up\nthey're down and have many bouts of\nsleep within that 24-hour period and\nthat's polyphasic sleep the other term\nor the other application of that term\npolyphasic sleep has been used more so\nin the sort of interesting biohacker\nmovement and we can we'll come back to\nthat perhaps later on so how do these\ndifferent phases of sleep change across\nthe lifespan well we've already said\nthat when you're an infant and you're\nfirst born within the first year of life\nyou are incredibly poly phasic and you\nare probably going through wake sleep\nphases every 2 hours why do you do that\nwhy can't you just simply be born and\nsleep in a monophasic way it's for at\nleast two reasons first an infant needs\nto feed every two hours so their energy\nneeds and their food intake requirements\ndictate that you can't sleep for very\nlong because you need to be awake to\nfeed and then you go back to\nsleep Within probably the first six\nmonths things will start to to change a\nlittle bit but the second reason that\nyou are highly polyphasic when you are\nfirst born is because your super\nchiasmatic nucleus and in another\nepisode we spoke about this Central\nmaster 24-hour clock that beats out your\nCadian Rhythm the rise and the fall the\nwake and the sleep that has not yet\ndeveloped it hasn't been glued into\nplace into the brain this 24-hour clock\nso the infant seemingly knows nothing\nabout when it's light or when it's dark\noutside that just awake or sleep awake a\nsleeve so that's the second reason\nenergy feeding needs is the first and\nthen an absence of yet a fully developed\n24-hour clock in the brain to beat out\nthat beautiful dictated Rhythm by about\nage one that number of phases of sleep\nare starting to decrease but it's still\nhighly polyphasic it's not not until you\nget to probably age two or three that\nnow you're starting to see this\nconsolidation of sleep what do I mean by\nthat sleep is now happening more\ndominantly in the night phase of the\n24-hour cycle and there a few abouts of\nsleep during the\ndaytime then perhaps by the time you're\nin kindergarten you may be down to just\ntwo sleeps so now we've switched from\npolyphasic sleep as infants to basic\nsleep as kindergarten could you describe\nthat it was basic patterns I recall in\nkindergarten um having nap time in the\nafternoon they put out these little mats\nand every every kid would just kind like\nroll up it's actually sounds really nice\nit's one you know wouldn't and we'll\nspeak about how some adults do this too\nbut almost every kindergarten system\nthat I've inquired about around the\nworld different nations they all have\nthis nap time and Any teacher will tell\nyou if one of those children does not\nnap during that period of time they are\nthe Loose Canon they are the live wire\nand in subsequent episodes we'll speak\nabout exactly how sleep harnesses and\nimproves our emotional and mental health\nand how it falls apart when we don't so\nthat that's how it certainly is emerging\nbiologically and that's how we as a\nsociety respect that and accommodate\nthat\nand then probably by the age of starting\nschool so sort of five or six now we're\nstarting to see fully monophasic sleep\nchildren sleeping long bouts at night\nand then being able to sustain\nwakefulness during the day at that point\nyou have locked in your monophasic\npattern and that will continue\nthroughout adulthood and into old age\nwith a few caveats that we'll speak\nabout so that's how sleep sleep unfolds\nin the monophasic biphasic polyphasic\nsleep across the lifespan it doesn't\nquite tell you however how those\ndifferent stages of sleep change across\nthe lifespan so I've shown you the view\nof sleep across the lifespan through one\nlens of the microscope if we click down\none lens and focus more deeply on the\ndifferent stages of sleep there we see a\nfascinating\nstory in uo for the most part you are in\na sleep likee State as a fetus once you\nget to a certain point of\ndevelopment in utero that sleep-like\nstate seems to be more so something that\nlooks like REM sleep now it's not fully\nfledged full fat REM sleep yet but it\nseems to be something very much like REM\nsleep I say this because in the first\nepisode I told you as we go into REM\nsleep\nand we start to as adults dream the\nbrain paralyzes the body so that the\nmind can dream safely those kicks and\nthose punches and those elbows that uh a\nmother will feel from the fetus seem to\nbe during this dream state often and I\ndon't want to shatter any illusions of\nyou start singing or you're cing and you\nget these bumps and these elbows and\nthese legs kicking and it's beautiful it\nis beautiful but it turns out that it's\nprobably the REM sleep state but the\nmuscle sort of paralysis has not yet\ndeveloped so you're getting these\nelectrical burst this frenetic activity\nof REM sleep that we described but\nyou're not getting any of the blockade\nof the motor output and so it expresses\nitself as these kicks and these\nbumps and then during the first six\nmonths of life and at that point in the\nfirst 6 months those infants are\nsleeping anywhere between 14 to 17 hours\na day that's it's immense isn't it I\nmean it's right up there if you look\nacross the across philogyny and you ask\nwhich is by the way a fascinating Topic\nat some point we should do a a separate\npodcast on sleep across different\nspecies because I know like me you love\nyou know the whole variety of sweet but\nyou've got elephants who will sleep as\nlittle as 4 hours and then you've got\nthe little brown bat who is the rock\nstar of sleep and it will sleep sleep\nalmost 17 to 18 hours a day it nudges\nout the sloth in that sense wow can I\nask you a question about that little\nbrown P yeah does it sleep hanging\nupside down does so it can't have sleep\nparalysis in its little claws so it it\nwill it will not have that paralysis but\nit goes through the stages of sleep very\nquickly and this happens with birds as\nwell so birds that flock on a branch\nthey will sleep and they sleep in some\nfascinating ways what some sometimes\nwith one half of the brain sometimes\nwith both halves but then you say well\nif I'm on a branch and there's this\nwonderful Force called gravity\nunderneath me and I go into REM sleep\nand I have that muscle paralysis which\nthey do how does that work well they\nonly have very brief REM sleep periods\nthat last just for a few seconds and\nthen they regain their muscle tone got\nit couldn't couldn't help but ask it's\ngenius the Flora and the fauna I\nespecially that the fauna um enchant me\nthat much so I don't want to draw us off\ncourse but now we know that they can\nthat's why the bats don't fall that's\nwhy the birds Don't Fall correct um so\nwhen you are then as an infant sleeping\n14 to 17 hours what's happening with\nthose different stages of sleep non-rem\nand REM at that point we can't really\nDefine and separate the different stages\nof non-r because it's not yet fully\nformed but we have what looks like a REM\nsleep active State and a a deep non-rem\nsleep passive state almost 50% of the\ntime that an infant a newborn is asleep\nis spent in REM sleep why do I say that\nwith some kind of wonder in my voice\nbecause as adults we're perhaps down to\nmaybe 20% of our time spent asleep is in\nREM sleep but 50% of the time when an\ninfant is asleep they are in rem why\nwould this be the case and across all\nspecies that have REM and non-rem the\ntime when we see REM sleep in highest\nvolume amount is always after birth\nthere is something special about REM\nsleep and its function during that early\nperiod and we now start to understand\nwhy when you are first born you are\nstill going through a huge amount of\nbrain\nmaturation and the recipe for the day\nthere unlike when we are teenagers is\nexploding the brain with synapses all of\nthese connections throughout the brain\nwhat we've discovered is that REM sleep\nacts as an electrical fertilizer to\nstimulate the growth of these\nconnections within the brain it's almost\nas though you could think about an\ninternet service provider with this huge\nnew neighborhood and the first call of\nbusiness is to go in and wire up each\none of those homes with these Fiber\nOptic Cables that's what REM sleep is\ndoing and if you start to deprive and\nthese were studies gosh done many years\nago by Howard rthor and others if you\ndeprive animals of REM sleep you stunt\nthe developmental growth of the brain\nand presumably the whole animal and the\nyeah as a consequence I mean if you look\nat its social behavior even just that\nit's profoundly abnormal because you\ndon't have that REM sleep developed\nbrain I mention this not because there\nis any causal evidence but we have seen\nREM sleep deep impairments in certain\ndevelopmental\ndisorders such as autism as well as ADHD\nI don't think there is any supportive\nevidence yet to come out with a claim\nthat part of the trajectory underlying\nthose conditions is abnormalities of REM\nsleep but I it's a very active area of\nresearch so it's a fascinating time\nthough during infancy when you get these\nhuge amounts of REM sleep why because of\nwhat we call synaptogenesis is which is\nsimply the creation of sinapsis\nGenesis then as you move from 6 months\nacross the next 18 months something odd\nhappens Total Sleep time starts to\ndecrease REM sleep starts to decrease\nbut non-rem sleep actually increases\neven though Total Sleep time is\ndecreasing and there's a strange peak in\nlighter stage nonrem what we call stage\ntwo nonr and those sleep spindles that I\nwas describing in the first episode\nThese bursts of electrical\nactivity we will speak about the role of\nthose sleep spindles in improving motor\nskill learning and we've done a many\nmany years of work in this area why is\nthat relevant to this phase of life\nthat's right around the time when\ninfants start to coordinate their limbs\nin a skilled way and begin to walk and\nwe believe that it is part of the\nprocess of the development of the motor\nsystem enabling walking to begin amazing\nso then things will change further sleep\ntime continues to decrease and by about\nage five or six now the cocktail blend\nof nonrem and REM is down to a stable\nratio that will remain throughout the\nlifespan which is a 4:1 ratio so about\n20% of the time that you're asleep will\nbe REM sleep and the remaining time time\nwill be 80% of that time will be non-rem\nsleeping provided one is getting\nsufficient total amounts of sleep\ncorrect and getting it at the right\nmoments in time that we described in the\nfirst episode getting that sort of that\nappropriate chronotype match to the\n24-hour clock that will certainly alter\nthose things too so that's how sleep\nunfolds both at the first level of the\nlens monophasic basic polyphasic and\nthen double clicking how the different\nstages of sleep unfold and what the\nreasons are behind that I then said once\nwe're adults we become\nmonophasic yes to a degree but there is\nsome contention about the way that we\nsleep in modernity that we may not be\nsleeping in the way that we were\ndesigned to sleep which brings us back\nto basic sleep in the first episode we\nspoke about this strange after afternoon\ndip in our alertness that happens called\nthe postprandial dip and it happens\nsomewhere between the 1 to 4:00 p.m.\nregion and it's measurable and it seems\nto be biologically wired into\nus if you look at certain cultures that\nare not touched by modernity so we and\nothers have studied studied hunter\ngatherer tribes they don't quite sleep\nthe way that we do and they don't sleep\nthe way that we do for at least two\nreasons the first is that they will\noften have a siesta like pattern of\nbehavior where especially in the hot dry\nseason they will take a nap in the\nafternoon in the wet cooler season that\nmay not be the case but they certainly\nhave more of a basic pattern where\nthey'll sleep longer at night and then\nhave a short nap Siesta like and then of\ncourse there are Latin and Mediterranean\ncultures and they have this practice of\nthe Siesta like Behavior coming back to\nthe hunter gather tribes the way that\nthey also do not sleep in a similar\nmanner to that which we do is the timing\nof sleep they don't go to sleep as the\nsun goes down they will usually on\naverage as a group they will usually go\nto sleep about 2 hours after Sundown and\nthen they will wake up not with the\nrising of the sun they wake up just\nbefore that and you think how are they\npredictive of the light no the thing\nthat changes first before the sun truly\nRises is\ntemperature and temperature is a very\nstrong predictor that forces them\nawake so when you think about how\nthey're sleeping then consider the term\nmidnight most of us never really think\nabout what the term means midnight\nrefers to the fact that it is the middle\nof the night but for most of us in the\nmodern world that's the time when we're\nthinking about sending our last email or\nposting to social media midnight is no\nlonger midnight for society but it is\nfor them so should we be thinking about\nmidnight as the middle of the night in\nthe context of the uh extreme early\nperson morning person who you know\npresumably likes to go to bed around\n8:00 P.M wake up around 4:00 a.m. most\npeople hear 4:00 a.m. and they go oh\ngoodness you know that's early sort of\num you know like the the mighty Joo\nwillink is is uh famous for posting\nimages of his of his uh digital watch\nusually I think it's 4:30 a.m. wake up\nand that's when he starts his workout so\nhis Twitter and I guess they call X now\nfeed and and Instagram is a replete with\nimages of his watch 4:30 and people\nthink goodness that's early right but he\nwas a guest on this podcast spoken to\nhim before but he goes to bed pretty\nearly that's right most nights so in\nsome sense you know midnight for him or\nfor somebody with a similar schedule is\ntruly middle of the night that's right\nright but for the other chronotypes for\npeople that uh prefer to go to sleep or\nwho naturally um get sleepy around 10 or\n11 p.m. or even later um how should they\nthink about this basic polyphasic\nbusiness because um at some level um we\nall have to\nreconcile uh our sleep schedule with the\nwith the demands of work and family and\nso on that's right so I was very\nspecific when I said the hunter gather\nof tribes on average that's the way that\nthey will sleep but like the rest of\nsociety there's a huge distribution and\nthere will be some proportion of them\nwho are a little bit like Joo who will\nbe on the early side of that on the very\nearly side of that but then there are\nother people who are clear night owls\nand they may not be going to bed until\nyou know 10: or 11: and waking up\nlater so there is a distribution there\nyou don't have to worry that my\nstatement of midnight on average that\ndoes seem to be when we are dislocated\nfrom all of the trappings of modernity\nhow a group of Representative humans on\naverage will sleep but there is huge as\nI said differences from one individual\nto the next by the way you can ask the\nquestion why do we have these things\ncalled chronotypes why is there such\nvariability in how people have a\npreference for when they sleep wouldn't\nit just be easier if\nbiology designed us all to be asleep at\nthe same time not so we mentioned in the\nfirst episode that sleep is truly\nidiotic in the sense that you know\nyou're not protecting yourself or the\npeople that you care about and if\neveryone slept at the same moment in\ntime you as a collective and as an\nindividual would be vulnerable for an 8\nhour period 7 to n hour period but by\nway of this wonderful injection of\nvariability as to preferences for when\npeople sleep maybe there are some people\nwho are going to bed at 8:00 p.m. and\nthere are other people and they're\nwaking up at 4: a.m. there are other\npeople who go to bed at midnight and\nwake up at 8:00 a.m. so then think about\nthat at some point what you've done is\nthat there will always be someone or\ncollection of people awake until\nmidnight and then will always be a\ncollection of people who are awake\nstarting at 4:00 a.m.\nso as an individual everyone gets their\n8-hour opportunity but as a collective\nas a clan you are you've reduced your\nvulnerability down by 50% because Mother\nNature injected the variability by way\nof genetics of chronotype to distribute\nthat and lessen the burden does that\nmake any sense it does and it reminds me\nof how the Circadian rhythm which we\ndiscussed in episode one is about 24\nhours not exactly 24 hours the rhythm of\nthe supermatic nucleus neurons that\ngenerate the Circadian rhythm as I\nrecall uh is rarely exactly 24 hours\nit's 24.2 or 24.4 and the idea in mind\nthe just so story uh is that that\nvariation allows for entrainment\nmatching to the outside light dark cycle\nwhich changes across the year so you\ndon't want it rigidly 24 hours because\nif there's any variation in light dark\nwhich of course there is you know even\nat the equator across the year there's\nsubtle variations but certainly As you\nmove away from the equator and so these\nthese uh variations in you know your\ncircadian rhythm uh clock scn supermatic\nnucleus might be 24.2 mine might be 24.6\n24 someone else\n24.1 and in that sense um allows some uh\nmalleability to to matching the\nCircadian rhythm to outside light dark\nrhythms is that is that a a decent\nparallel for what we're talking about\nit's a beautiful demonstration that\nthere is always some it's almost wiggle\nroom in how biology is programmed\nbecause some degree of sort of noise\nalmost sarcastic noise can be very\nbeneficial and it's much more predictive\nof the way in which the world works and\nit's much more adaptive for a species to\nenact and to embrace that kind of\nvariability and yours was a beautiful\nexample\nthat it's about 24 hours but it's\ncertainly responsive to changes in light\nduration across the year and it has to\nbe because we need to buckle ourselves\nto the light dark cycle for optimal\nsurvival and here is another\ndemonstration of where it's not about\nthe Cadian Rhythm but it's about the\nchronotype distribution not within an\nindividual across the year but across\nindividuals at any one moment in time\nand that variability once again provides\na biological\nbenefit in the first episode and again\nnow you're discussing chronotypes and\none one thing that I've been meaning to\nask is you said that chronotype is\ngenetically determined but that\nnecessarily mean it is directly\ninherited from Mom Andor dad meaning if\nyour parents are both uh extreme early\nmorning types will you grow up to be an\nextreme early morning type you already\nestablished that during infancy and\ndevelopment uh adolescence Etc that our\nchronotype is somewhat masked by some of\nthe developmental uh um uh Necessities\num but once we reach young adulthood and\nand our chronotype has been established\nuh can we look to our parents to\ndetermine whether or not we are more\nlikely to be in morning person or or\nlate shifted it's very unlikely to find\nfind anyone whose parents were both\nextreme morning types who is a neutral\nor an evening type and vice versa so my\nguess is that people with if they know\nof their biological parents and they\nknow of their rhythms it's highly likely\nthat you will at some point acquas in\nyour lifetime to being very similar to\nthem now there are certain life\nconditions and contexts where you can\nyou know fight that um if you're really\ninto you know if you're someone who is\nin punk rock band and you're touring all\nthe time even though your mom and dad\nmay be morning types and you may be a\nmorning type you're on the road you're\nplaying gigs there's no chance but at\nsome point let's say you retire and you\ngive yourself the opportunity to express\nyour natural Rhythm you will go back to\nthat so yes it's highly genetic it's not\nenre highly genetic there is some degree\nof modification that happens on the\nbasis of context and I've just given you\na good example of context and also your\nexposure to light you can be someone who\nis let's say a neutral like me but if\nyou're constantly invaded by Electric\nLight at night you're drinking too much\ncaffeine and you're on your laptop and\nyour computer and your phone and you're\nalways activated by social media it's\nvery easy for someone like me to drift\nand become a 1 a.m. to you know 9 a.m.\nperson that's not my natural type but\ncontext and the environment have shifted\nme but for the most part yes to your\nquestion I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that\nalso contains adaptogens and is designed\nto meet all of your foundational\nnutritional needs by now I'm sure you've\nall heard me say that I've been taking\nag1 since 201 12 and indeed that is true\nnow of course I do consume regular Whole\nFoods every day I strive to get those\nFoods mostly from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources however I do\nfind it hard to get enough servings of\nfruits and vegetables each day so with\nag1 I ensure that I get enough of the\nvitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber and\nother things typically found in fruits\nor vegetables and of course I still make\nsure to eat fruits and vegetables and in\nthat way provide a sort of insurance\nthat I'm getting enough of what I need\nin addition the adaptogens and other\nmicro nutrients in ag1 really help\nbuffer against stress and ensure that\nthe cells and organs and tissues of my\nbody are getting the things they need\npeople often ask me that if they were\ngoing to take Just One supplement what\nthat supplement should be and I always\nanswer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you\ncan go to drink a1.com huberman to claim\na special offer you'll get five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman okay so getting back to these\ndifferent uh phase opportunities for\nSleep uh clearly I'm getting the\nlanguage wrong here but vacular\nmonophasic basic and polyphasic um could\nyou give us a few more examples of\ndifferent types of biphasic and\npolyphasic sleep so coming back to basic\nsleep I describe one version once we are\nadults which is the Siesta like notion\none long bout at night short bout during\nthe day and that bout during the day is\nusually matching that drop in alertness\nthat we described it sort of hits that\nsweet spot right there and it's quite\neasy for some people to fall asleep in a\nperiod between somewhere between one and\nfour 1 to four yeah and I know it's a\nlarge window but that just allows us to\nsort of know okay if you're someone like\nyourself who's a morning type you would\nprobably start to want to nap a little\nbit earli or if you were basic someone\nlike me a neutral probably an hour and a\nhalf two hours later still\nbut there is a different version of\nbasic sleep for adults that has been\ndescribed in the literature and it's\nfascinating but I don't think it's\nbiological it's the notion that some\npeople will have heard called first\nsleep second sleep and now you are\nsplitting your sleep into two phases but\nthey're split across the night so the\nidea is that you fall asleep and you'll\nmaybe have 4ish hours and then you wake\nup and you then are awake for several\nhours and then you go back to sleep for\nanother 3 or 4\nhours if you look in history and the the\nrecord of of human history it's very\nclear that there were some cultures\ndoing this particularly if you look at\nsome of the European cultures Great\nBritain in particular there is good\nevidence that somewhere between about\nthe 15th to 19th century seems to have\nended during the kind of dezian\nera people were describing this behavior\nand they would wake up in the middle of\nthe night after about 4 hours they would\nmake food they would play music they\nwould write they would make love it was\na real thing and I'm not suggesting that\nit did not happen it clearly did and\nthere's a there a great book that\noutlines this but is it the way that we\nwere designed to sleep bif phasically\nversus the Siesta like and I don't think\nit is there is no good collection of\nevidence if you look at the biology of\nour human rhythms that argues that there\nis this magical period of a huge spike\nin Arcadian Rhythm that happens right in\nthe middle of the night that should\nforce us\nawake there is one paper that's often\ncited for this and in truth that paper\nif you read it says nothing about first\nsleep second sleep doesn't speak about\nbasic sleep at all\nand that paper I think is unfairly used\nas a justification of first sleep and\nsecond sleep and the paper to me has at\nleast three problem it's a great paper\nthere's no no problem with the paper and\nits hypothesis but its use as\njustification for first sleep second\nsleep has three\nproblems the first is the artificial\nnature of the study they weren't\ndesigning it to test the hypothesis but\nthey had individuals in bed for 14 hours\nrelative to a standard 8 hour period and\nsure enough what they found was that\nwhen you force people night after night\nto be in bed for 14 hours somewhere\nafter about 6 or 7 hours they wake up\nand then you can't get out of bed in the\nstudy so you just lie awake and then at\nsome point I don't know if it's through\nboredom or you drift back off into sleep\nand that was argued as a clear\ndemonstration of this split sleep but as\nI said they're awake usually for about\nsix and a half seven\nhours also there was no magical\nAwakening period it's a probability\ndistribution and what that means is if\nyou look at the data it's just more\nlikely that people will wake up after\nabout 6 or seven hours and they're more\nlikely that they will go back down into\nsleep it wasn't as though the whole\nexperiment demonstrated a very clear\ntermination of sleep that everyone had\nat that moment in time so that's the\nfirst\nissue um and the second issue which is\nfirst issue it's kind of an abnormal\nthing 14 hours forced in bed the second\nis it wasn't a clear separation it's\njust simply higher probability the final\nissue is that it was a study done in\nonly seven individuals healthy males and\nso I have yet to see it you know scaled\nup did it happen first sleep second\nsleep yes it did is there any strong\nevidence that that's how we naturally\nwere designed and have evolved to sleep\nI in truth I don't think so at least I\ndon't see good evidence right now\nsupporting that but remain open to it in\nepisode one we talked a little bit about\nbody position during sleep uh and how\ndifferent uh degrees of uh incline or\ndecline might impact uh some of the\nfeatures of sleep and I can't help but\nask now as you uh described this basic\npattern for people that were essentially\nexperimentally restricted to to the bed\num is there something about being\nhorizontal that makes us\nsleepy there is and it's perhaps not for\nthe reasons that you would think which\nis okay I'm just pre-programmed when I\nlie down and my head hits the pillow it\nturns out that it seems to be\ntemperature that when your body is\nrecumbent lying flat\nhorizontal the distribution of how your\nbody is able to move blood around the\ndifferent regions and decrease your core\nbody temperature meaning it can push\nblood warm blood out of the core of your\nbody to these surface areas and when you\npush it out to the surface areas you\nrelease that heat it's this huge thermal\ndissipation that happens when we move\nBlood Out Of The Core to the surface you\nemit that heat and your core body\ntemperature plummets when your body\ntemperature your core body temperature\ndecreases you have a higher likelihood\nof sleepiness in fact it's very\ndifficult for you to fall asleep if your\ncore body temperature does not drop and\nby lying down the body's what we call\nvasoactive ability to distribute that\nblood in a way that is permissive for\nthermal dissipation of core body\ntemperature is superior and that's the\nreason why we find it easier to fall\nasleep lying down than let's say\nsemi-recumbent or certainly propped all\nthe way up and it's probably the reason\nnaturally we evolve just to lie down on\nthe floor very\ninteresting maybe now is a good time to\ntalk\nabout basic sleep in the context of a\nabout of sleep at night and the\nafternoon nap you've mentioned this\npostp parial dip that most people\nexperience between 1: and 400 p.m. that\nmany people try and combat with caffeine\nwe will also talk about Caffe\nuh this episode um such an interesting\nsubstance and I think the most commonly\nused drug it is a drug after all\nworldwide I think more than\n90% of adults worldwide consume caffeine\non a daily basis that's correct and I\nbelieve it is after oil it may\nbe perhaps the second or at least the\nthird most traded commodity on this\nplanet and it is what we call a\npsychoactive stimulant is a stimulant\nand it's probably one of the only\nstimulants that we will readily give to\nour children and you know not be too\nconcerned about it we'll get to caffeine\nin depth uh a little bit later in this\nepisode but I can't help but uh just\nmention that someone I think it was\nMichael Polland said that you know\ncaffeine is one of the few drugs that\nalmost everybody takes just to quote\nunquote feel normal yeah exactly you\nknow it's sort of I think sometimes you\nknow sleep deprivation is is\nsimply just the absence of of caffeine\nand um so it's a very interesting\nchemical which I have in truth changed\nmy mind on and I'm happy to speak about\nwhy I've changed my mind but also some\nGod rails too we we'll we'll go there\nmeanwhile I'll take a sip of my uh\nTriple Espresso here as we discuss as we\ndiscuss naps are naps good for us should\nwe nap what if we don't like naps why do\nwe wake up from naps groggy sometimes\nand other times we feel refreshed tell\nus about\nnapping naps are both good and bad\ndepending on the situation naps can be a\ndouble-edged sword in other words we and\nothers have done lots of studies on naps\nand the benefits are fascinating and St\nI'll tell you about one study we did we\nhad participants assigned to one of two\ngroups and at midday they all learned a\nwhole list of new facts so it was a\nstudy about learning in memory and then\none group took a 90-minute sleep\nopportunity sort of focused right around\nthat drop in alertness the other just\nremained awake lying on a bed and they\njust watched a nature\ndocumentary and then 5 hours later we\nhad them do another learning session and\nso they've woken up after the 90-minute\nnap they've got through that sort of\ninitial lull that we'll discuss what\nthat is after you wake up everyone's now\nback to operating temperature so in\nother words I've had you try to cram in\na whole list of facts at midday and then\na whole list of facts new facts again at\n5 p.m. and I can ask what is the\nlearning capacity of your brain at\nmidday and at 5:00 p.m. and is there any\ndifference in your learning ability when\nyou have had a nap in between versus not\nand sure enough what happened in the\ngroup that did not nap their learning\ncapacity gradually declined across the\nday the nap group they were able to\nsustain their learning and in fact if\nanything improve it and the difference\nbetween those two groups at 5:00 p.m.\nwas about\n20% so that's certainly non-trivial in\nterms of if you to say you know here's a\nnew compound that can boost your\nlearning capacity by 20% would you take\nit I suspect it would probably make some\nmoney so that's a demonstration of for\nlearning in memory we did another study\nvery much like that in terms of its\ndesign but we looked at your emotional\nbrain and we were showing people\ndifferent types of emotional expressions\nand having them rate them and we did\nthat firstly before an appp and then\nafter a nap versus um that same time in\nsort of midday versus 5:00 p.m. and\nanother group did not nap and sure\nenough the group that did not nap\nby about 5:00 p.m. they were starting to\nrate fearful faces and angry faces as\nmuch more fearful and much more angry\nbut if you looked at the group that\nnapped it was different they actually\nlessened the response to fear and they\nblunted the normal increase in Anger\nsensitivity across the day and the nap\nseemed to boost how positively you rated\nhappy faces\nso a nap there had the ability to reset\nthe magnetic north of your emotional\ncompass and there was a beneficial\nalmost added Rose tint to your world viw\nglasses after You' napped what was also\ninteresting in those two studies two\ndifferent types of sleep were\ntransacting those benefits in the nap\ngroup that was doing the learning the\nlearning benefit that they got wasn't\njust about them napping and sleeping it\nwas about them having these sleep\nspindles the more of those sleep\nspindles that you had the greater the\nrestoration of your learning capacity\nwhen you wake up for the emotional\nrecalibration that I described in the\nnap that had nothing to do with sleep\nspindles or even non-rem sleep it\nrequired REM sleep to produce that\nbenefit so there are certainly many\nbenefits and we've look downstairs in\nthe body blood pressure cardiovascular\nmeasures immune Health they all seem to\nbenefit so at that point everyone may be\nthinking of course this sounds good not\nto mention the basics which is your\nattention your concentration your focus\nand your energy all improve by way of\nnaps even your decision- making you said\ndecision- making yeah even your\ndecision-making is improved so your\ncapacity to make the correct decisional\noutcomes based on this weight of\nevidence that you're facing that's also\nimproved so almost all areas of\ncognition that we've looked at and many\nareas of your emotional and mood Health\nwe've looked at seem to benefit by way\nof a nap at that point you're thinking\nso then what's the problem the problem\nis that when you nap you release some of\nthat sleep pressure that's been building\nup so in the first episode we spoke\nabout a chemical called adenosine and\nthe longer that you're awake the more\nadenosine that builds up the more\nadenosine that builds up the sleepy you\nwill feel and after about 16 hours of\nbeing awake you should have lots of\nhealthy sleepiness of adenosine in your\nbrain to put you asleep and keep you\nasleep and when we sleep we are able to\nclear that adenosine from the brain so\nwe wake up after 7 to 9 hours and if\nit's been good quality sleep we're\nrefreshed because we've cleansed the\nbrain in part of that\nadenosine when you take a\nnap like a pressure valve on a steam\ncooker you just Rel relase some of that\nhealthy sleepiness that you've been\nbuilding up so the the Dark Side of\nnapping is if you are struggling with\nsleep and you suffer from insomnia the\nadvice is do not nap during the day\nbecause you're setting yourself up for\nan even higher probability of failure at\nnight why because when you nap you\nrelease some of that good sleepiness\nthat we need to build up for you as\nsomeone who is struggling with sleep to\ngive you the greatest chance of awai of\nsleepiness on your\nshoulders so if you are not struggling\nwith sleep and you can nap regularly I\nwould say naps are just fine and we can\nunpack what is an optimal nap and the\nprotocol for what napping should\nbe I would say that's great the only\ncaveat is make sure that you're not\nnapping too late into the day and this\nis one of the components of the protocol\nof how to nap because napping late in\nthe day is too close to sleep and you\ncan think of it almost like snacking\nbefore your main meal a nap late in the\nday just takes the appetite edge off\nyour sleepiness so that when it comes\ntime for sleep you're not as hungry\nanymore so just keep that in mind but we\ncan unpack perhaps the optimal way to\nnap if you are going to nap and exactly\nthe dos and the don'ts of that if that\nsounds of somewhat interest yeah that is\nuh of immen interest to me and I know\nmany other people I'm a huge believer in\nnaps I've always enjoyed um short naps\nof about 10 to 30 minutes unless I'm\nsomehow sleep deprived in which case I\nwill sleep for an hour or even a little\nbit more but I make sure I set an alarm\nU really based on advice that you gave\nme which was to um first of all decide\nwhether or not a nap is beneficial for\nfor for me or for whoever is considering\nthat um but then to make sure that\nhowever long that nap is zero to 90\nminutes that it not be longer than 90\nminutes because the real goal is to not\ndisrupt nighttime sleep that's right\nwhich is essentially just a a more\nlong-winded way of saying what you just\nsaid so how does one determine the\noptimal duration of nap um and in\nparticular to avoid the problem of\ndisrupting nighttime sleep by napping\nbut also this uh rather common\nphenomenon of waking up and feeling kind\nof groggy or even I'm kind of grumpy the\npost-nap face uh or we should call the\npost-nap expression\nright right the P NE what's your P are\ndo you wake up um in the and for morning\ntoo some people wake up and they're like\nthat that face and then there's the like\ngood morning you know and I think people\nthat wake up with the good morning are\nparticularly delightful unless you're of\nthe post Snap expression that is kind of\nthe the crumpled face and then you just\nyou don't want to be around those people\nright no absolutely\num yeah and this probably relates to\nspirit animals and things like that some\npeople wake up like a like a cheerful\nchipmunk and other people seem to wake\nup like my Bulldog Costello where it's\nyou know um jowls still in contact with\nthe floor yeah so I'm P I'm trying to\nhold it together and not Absol just fall\napart it's brilliant please trade market\nso firstly to your question how to\noptimally nap the word optimal is\ninteresting because is when you people\nsay how long should I nap what's the\noptimal nap duration the question I have\nback to them is what are you trying to\noptimize because once I understand what\nyou're trying to optimize I can give you\na better prescription non-medical I'm\ntalking about here the a better sort of\nyou know protocol piece of advice for\nhow to nap I mentioned the study about\nemotional faces in part for a specific\nreason cuz I told you there the benefit\ncame by way not of non REM sleep but REM\nsleep and in our first episode we said\nthat when you go through these on\naverage 90minut Cycles you get most of\nyour non-rem sleep first and then you'll\nhave this bout of REM sleep at the end\nand it always seems to go that way when\nyou are a healthy normal person you go\ninto non-rem sleep and then you go into\nREM sleep it's very rare that you ever\ngo directly into REM sleep there are\nonly two reasons when that seems to\nhappen the first is a clinical condition\ncalled noopsy where you can have sleep\nonset REM sleep and very rare the second\nis if you are horrifically deprived of\nREM sleep night after night after night\nand I let you sleep then at that point\nREM sleep the pressure for REM sleep has\nbeen built to to the point of being\nalmost just insatiable and your brain\ngoes straight into REM sleep but with\nthose two things aside you go into\nnon-rem sleep first so I brought up the\nemotional study of resetting your sort\nof mood uh compass\nbecause to get that REM sleep you had to\nnap for a longer period of time because\nyou had to get through the non-rem sleep\nfirst before you get the REM sleep but\nlet's come back to then assuming optimal\nis for most people when they speak about\nnaps I just want the quick reboot I want\nmy alertness and concentration which are\nfailing because I'm staring at the\nscreen or I just can't concentrate on\nthe work that I'm doing I want my\nalertness and my concentration to be\nimproved proved I want that sort of\nslight boost in brain energy where I\nknow I can sustain myself for now a\nlonger period of time and I've got the\nmotivation which is really in some ways\nhow I like to think about energy as well\nI've got the motivation the drive to\nkeep going which is just starting to\nfail me to get those basic things which\nis what most people nap for aim for 20\nminute nap why 20 minutes if I thin\nslice the nap duration and and those\nStudies have been done where we look at\nessentially what's called a dose\nresponse curve I give you 5 minutes of a\nnap 10 minutes of a nap 15 minutes 20\nminutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 90\nminutes after 5 or 10 minutes you don't\nreally get very much you will wake up\nand you'll have some degree of improved\nalertness and your basic reaction time\nmay be a little bit quicker but that\nFades very quickly and you don't sustain\nthat\nbenefit once you get past about 15 to 17\nminutes now things start to look\ndifferent you get these nice benefits\nfor concentrational alertness and\nmotivation and those things sustain so\nonce you wake up out of that probably\nreally I would say 20 minute nap at that\npoint you've got some good wind in your\nconcentration and energy sales for the\nbrain and that will sustain you\nthroughout the rest of the afternoon and\ninto the\nevening the benefit of the 20-minute nap\nis that you don't get the\nPNE trademark Andrew hubman you don't\nget that almost sleep hangover so some\npeople will say it's strange I nap maybe\nI'll nap 45 minutes 50 minutes and I\nwake up and to be honest Matt I almost\nfeel worse after the nap than I did\nbefore and I don't understand it it's\nsomething called Sleep inertia\nand an extreme version of this is in the\nfirst two hours of your night of sleep\nyou get a phone call or an alarm goes\noff and you wake up and you are just\nkind of lost in the ocean you're looking\naround at your surroundings you're just\nin this groggy State you're half awake\nhalf asleep and you can respond and you\ncan do things but boy does it feel\nmiserable and it's almost as though\nyou're going from the ground floor right\nup to the penthouse suite but you get\nstuck somewhere in between kind of you\nknow floor 13 and it's this rough\nstate if you go out into sleep light\nstage one nonrem then stage two nonr and\njust before you get into the very\ndeepest stages of non Ram 3 and four\nthat starts to happen around 30 to 40\nminutes for most people but by cutting\nyour nap off at 20 minutes you still get\nthese nice benefits from a good chunk of\nhealthy non-rem sleep but you're not\ngoing so far into the cycle so deep into\nyour nonr that when you wake up after 20\nminutes you're not in that what we call\nSleep inertia phase that sleep\ngrogginess that sleep hangover phase so\nit's a nice benefit that you get all of\nthese improvements in your brain but you\nwake up and very quickly you're back up\nto operating temperature and you don't\nsuffer that inertia now that's not to\nsay that when you sleep or you nap\nlonger\nyou don't start to get more benefits you\ndo and those benefits are both greater\nin their magnitude and sustain for a\nlonger period of time they do it's just\nthat you have to understand the tradeoff\nthat you will suffer which is I will get\nmore bang for my book and I will get\nmore benefits but I will in the first\nsort of hour or so have to understand\nthat at that point I may even be\nfunctioning worse than than that which I\ndid before I even started napping but if\nyou're patient and you go through it the\nrewards on the other side are\nsignificantly better still so that's the\nfirst piece of advice and when it comes\nto how to nap I would say the dose and\nthe timing make the poison and poison is\nhyperbole in here it's simply just the\npoison being how much sleep and nurs\nyou're going to suffer so aim for about\n20 minutes that's the do the timing\ncomes back to that which we described\nbefore do not nap too late into the day\nso what's the rule of thumb here for a\nprotocol on average for the average\nadult I would say don't nap after about\n300 p.m. 20 minute naps sometime between\n300 p.m. and if you're struggling with\nsleep don't do this at all if you're not\nand you're able to get to sleep fine\nthis seems to be a good ingredient for\nthe basic return on your investment\nagain if you tell me what's the optimal\nnap duration we need to have a\nconversation to understand what is it\nthat you're going after here what are\nthe benefits and then I can sort of you\nknow create a finger Buffet Kaleidoscope\nmatch to what you need and we can think\nabout the nap duration as a consequence\nthank you that's very informative um I\nhave a colleague at Stanford who's a\nHoward Hughes investigator which for\nthose that don't know is a a rather\nelite club of uh academic research they\nhave to essentially try out for it they\ncan every 5 years they go up for Renewal\nit's it's a lot of money which makes\ngives them a greater capacity to uh take\non greater risk uh work higher risk work\num and he's also a member of the\nNational Academy and he was one of these\npeople that graduated high school at 15\nyears of age one of these phenoms and he\nis so religious about his napping such\nthat when he travels to give seminars at\nother schools he insists that they\nschedule a nap time for him after lunch\nand in his office um you know at between\n12:30 and and 1: p.m. he's napping\neveryone knows this and um and I mention\nthis because I think that um oftentimes\npeople think of the Nappers as the lazy\nones but um his output is um near\nsuperhuman and he attributes U much of\nthat output uh to the nap not just the\npost-nap work that he's able to perform\nbut his ability to uh just kind of\nmanage so many ideas he has enormous\nlaboratory and that's just one example I\nthink there are examples from sport of\num sprinters taking naps on the you know\non the side of the the track field I\nmean so it seems that a capacity to nap\nis also something worth considering\nbecause I think many people listening to\nthis are thinking well I can't nap\nshould I nap you know um and can one\nteach themselves to nap so that's the\nquestion um if one would want to explore\nnapping and um is that something that\none should even consider doing if you\ndon't have a propensity to nap should\nyou avoid it if you want to try naps how\ncould one teach oneself to nap you just\nmentioned earlier uh lying down uh\nrelates to body temperature body\ntemperature uh relates to sleepiness and\nthen as a third question I promise I'll\nrepeat these if we need to uh as a third\nquestion I'd like to have a little bit\nof a discussion about some of the pseudo\nnaap states that um I certainly am\nintrigued by you know for instance just\nlying down and I'm doing a progressive\nbodily relaxation things like Yoga Nidra\nuh non-sleep deep rest which is an\nacronym icoin simply to to um make it\nclear what I was talking about but it's\nvery similar to Yoga Nidra um things of\nthat sort in other words but simply\nshould everyone think about having an\nearly to mid-afternoon\nprotocol to reset their cognition and\ntheir body we call it a nap but does it\nhave to be a nap and if we're not good\nNappers should we try and if so how\nshould we go about it yeah so TI your\nthree questions firstly if you're not a\nnatural Napper should you start doing it\num if you want to start doing it how\nshould you do it and then the third is\nis there some kind of you know\nsubstitute for a like kind which would\nbe these Li these I I'd love the\nphraseology that you use these lional\nstates do they mimic that are they\ndifferent to that how should we think\nabout those the first thing I would say\nto point number one if you are not a\nnatural Napper don't necessarily Force\nyourself to be as long as you're getting\nthe sleep that you feel you need at\nnight and you feel refreshed and\nrestored during the day and you don't\nhave that sort of postrenal drop to the\npoint of thinking I almost need to nap\nduring the day there is no pressure\nbased on anything I've been telling you\nfor you to start napping nor should\nthere be any reason that you do start\nnapping but let's say that you want to\ntry what would be the right protocol to\nimprove and increase the likelihood\nthe best way you can do this is to mimic\nnighttime as best you can so wherever\nyou are if you can shut off the\nlights make sure that you can block out\nyou know curtains blinds if you can't do\nthat fully and many people won't be able\nto develop an IM mask procedure um so\nput an IM mask on make sure you block\nout noise earplugs you can use a sound\nmachine if you want and we can speak\nabout sort of sound machines and whether\nor not they're good or bad on sleep and\nthen you can lie down make sure that you\ntry to take your shoes off and get under\nsome kind of a blanket because we're so\nContex cued by having something wrapped\naround us called a blanket or a duvet\nthat to do it without that if you are\nnot a natural Napper can help you again\nthat some people will say I can just\nkick my feet up on my desk sit back in\nmy reclining chair in the office and I\ncan fall asleep that's great but if\nyou're not a natural person I'm just\ntrying to tell you things that increase\nthe probability of that and then set the\nalarm I like your idea of making sure\nthat if you do fall asleep you don't\naccidentally go too long and then just\nfeel miserable so mimic the conditions\nthat you're trying to get that you would\nnormally get at night that will increase\nthe probability mask out noise mask out\nlight kick your shoes off have some kind\nof a blanket wrapping around you that's\nprobably the best and then time it based\non this sort of post pral drop you will\nknow yourself everyone has fallen prey\nto it you know W it's usually around\nabout 3 4 p.m. that I do start to feel\nthis decline or it's around 1 p.m. try\nto match it in accordance with that so\nthose are the first I think two\nquestions should you not necessarily if\nyou would like to and I'm not normally\ndoing it how can you do it the final\npoint I think is fascinating which is\nthese alternate states\nof conscious brain activity the most\nobvious is when we're awake and when\nwe're asleep those are the two most\ndramatic changes in Consciousness that\nwe experience on a daily basis short of\nanesthesia I've become like you very\nfascinated by these sort of both\nmeditative States or these linal states\nI think at some point you and I should\ncollaborate and we should do some work\nand really unpack this but the reason I\nfind this interesting is because I'm\ngoing to guess you are having sleep\nlikee States but you are not fully\nasleep how would I Define a sleep-like\nstate what we've learned is that your\nbrain the way it sleeps isn't on mass\nit's not as though your entire brain\nsleeps different territories of your\nbrain can sleep in different\nways and what we've also known and\nthere's some argument even individual\nbrain cells seem to have a period where\nthey go into sleep and these individual\nneurons will start to show what look\nlike these beautiful big powerful deep\nslow waves in terms of their firing rate\nat least in terms of those neurons\nfiring away I bring this up because if\nthat means that your brain can have\nlocal sleep rather than Global sleep if\nyou are in global sleep you're out like\na light you are a sleep but perhaps\nthese Lial States the reason that they\ngive these benefits is because you are\nstill awake not Global sleep so if\nyou're in global sleep you're asleep but\nyou're awake so you're not in global\nsleep but you may be having local sleep\nnow using special um setups in my\nlaboratory we can apply tens maybe\nhundreds of electrodes all over your\nhead and we can map the the sort of the\nthe different places where your brain is\nhaving sleep in much higher resolution\nso rather than a you know 480 DPI movie\non YouTube I'm now in 4K resolution I\ncan really dismantle what's going on um\nanalytically in your brain I'm going to\nguess that when you're going into these\nstates and you report coming out of\nthose states and I ask you on a scale of\n1 to 10 how would you rate that as an\nexperience based on your common\nexperience the greater the intensity of\nthe Lial benefit and state that you\nexperienced I'm going to predict is\ndirectly related to the extent of this\nthis local deep non-rem slow wave sleep\nthat's happening you're still awake but\nsome parts of your brain for maybe\nseconds of time or maybe even tens of\nseconds of time I'm going to bed will be\noscillating in what look like slow wave\nsleep deep sleep States and if all I\nwould be able to look at is that one\npart of your brain and that small\ncluster of electrodes and someone said\nto me is this person awake or asleep I\nwould say oh they're asleep they're in\ndeep sleep but then if you slowly reveal\nand back out and show me the rest of the\nbrain and what it's doing I would say oh\nmy goodness no this person must be awake\nbut that local territory that District\nup there in their brain they were having\nslow wave\nsleep I think that's what we could find\nand that may predict some of the\nbenefits that you get some of the\nproductivity energy benefits by the way\nI should note that with all of this nap\nracket NASA figured this out back in the\n1980s they were looking at ways to\noptimize their astronauts because when\nyou are up in orbit depending on what\norbit you're in you are rotating around\nthe planet maybe 10 and 20 times per 24\nhours so you're seeing 10 to you know 20\nSuns sets and sunrises so your sleep is\na total mess and you can safety check\nalmost everything in terms of Technology\nbut the one weak Link in a space mission\nis this thing called the human being\nthat's where errors typically happen so\nhow do you drisk a human error up in\nspace because if you make an error up\nthere I mean on the ground not great up\nthere kind of\ncatastrophic you can try to optimize\ntheir ability to sleep and their ability\nto maintain Focus concentration\nalertness and productivity and what they\nfound was that these naps produced\nalmost a 20% boost in short naaps 20%\nboost in their alertness and almost a\n50% boost in their task productivity and\nit was so powerful that it translated to\nthe terrestrial um employees of NASA on\nthe ground and it became what was known\nas the NASA nap\nculture and from there on we had what we\ncalled power naaps Power naaps by the\nway why are they called power naaps and\nyou think well just because it Powers me\nup it's a good idea but it's wrong it\nhas a very specific story a fascinating\none two legends in my field David dingis\nuh and Mark Rose kind they were looking\nat how to instigate\nrisk mitigation not in astronauts but in\npilots who are doing long haul\nflights because the most dangerous\naspect of a long haul flight is when it\nis coming down to land and that's when\nthey can sometimes have these things\ncalled a catastrophic hole loss which is\na euphemistic phrase for a terrible\nplane crash and they were trying to say\nhow could you use nap\nstrategically to drisk that and improve\ntheir\nalertness and they asked a very\ninteresting question if they can nap for\nonly a certain period of time because\nthey have to be at work on the plane at\nthe for the rest of it when should you\nplace that nap should you do it at the\nstart of the long call flight in the\nmiddle or towards the end and most\npeople would bet like they I think did\nit's best to place it at the end when\nyou're really starting to struggle get\nthat boost and then you wake up you're\nnot in sleep in OA cuz it's been brief\nand then you're energized for landing\nthey didn't find that they found that\nthe most optimal time to nap was early\non in that long haul flight and it\nsustained them throughout the rest of\nthe flight now they took their findings\nto the FAA who were funding the work um\nand the Federal Aviation Authority here\nin the United States and they said we've\ngot some great findings and we think we\nshould implement this and we would like\nto use a term to help Pilots understand\nthis and it's called prophylactic\nnapping and of course there were many\nChuckles throughout the room perhaps\ninappropriate and they just said look\nyou've got to understand our Pilots the\nyou know kind of alpha male guys and if\nyou're starting to say you need to\nprophylactically NAB it's not going to\nbe adopted that's a noggo so they looked\naround the room because it's an alpha\nmale culture it's a mostly masculine\nculture at that time they said what\ncould we and there's a lot of beard\nstroking and they said I've got it power\nnaaps it's got to be about power and so\nthat is where if you've ever wondered\nwhere the term power naaps come from\nit's not because it reboosts your power\nwhich it does and boost it back up it's\nbecause there was Chuckles at the time\nprophylactic napping I'd like to take a\nbrief break and acknowledge our sponsor\neight sleep eight sleep makes Smart\nmattress covers with cooling Heating and\nsleep tracking capacity many times on\nthis podcast we discuss how in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually needs to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling maximally refreshed and\nenergized your body temperature needs to\nheat up by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmakes it very easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nso that it's easy to fall and stay\nasleep and wake up feeling refreshed I\nstarted sleeping on an eight- Sleep\nmattress cover several years ago and it\nhas completely and positively\ntransformed my sleep so much so that\nwhen I travel to hotels or airbnbs I\nreally miss my eight sleep I've even\nshipped my eight sleep out to hotels\nthat I've been staying in because it\nimproves my sleep that much if you'd\nlike to try eightsleep you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $150 off their pod 3\ncover eight sleep currently ships to the\nUSA Canada UK select countries in the EU\nand Australia again that's 8sleep.com SL\nhuberman the naming of things fascinates\nme especially in um the uh landscape of\nhealth and well-being um also um and\nthat's one reason why um having become a\nreal fan and practitioner of Yoga Nidra\nwhich I think translates to yoga sleep\nwhich is this process of lying down for\na period of 30 to 60 Minutes Progressive\nrelaxation this is these are scripts\nthat are readily available as this is a\na uh age-old practice um in in India um\nthat is meant to restore mental and\nphysical Vig Vigor by placing one into\none of these Lial States the um and I\nhave great respect for the uh ner\ntradition um but um sometimes the names\nare a separator so people who hear Yoga\nNidra and they think oh it must be yoga\nmovement and that's of course not true\nor they think um that there must be some\nmystical component to it which is not\nnecessarily true sometimes they include\nintentions and things like that but\noften not so that's why I coin this um\nuh phrase non-sleep deep rest which is\nessentially maintains the\ncritical components of Yoga Nidra um but\ndoesn't include intentions and um has\nthese shorter uh 10 or 20 minute um\nprotocols so it'd be um great fun and um\nI think very interesting for us to do\nthat project to explore what are the\nbrains uh activation States or\ndeactivation States as the case may be\nin these um non-traditional or Lial\nState uh practices now um along the\nlines of power napping specifically and\nthe naming of power napping I think it's\nmore than than just a a um anecdote\nbecause I think it is very important for\npeople to understand that um that these\nprotocols these tools that NASA and that\nLaboratories have have developed um\noften times are are for other purposes\nbut they translate to a kind of broader\nsignificance and what I'm hearing and\nwhat I'm starting to integrate as we\nhave today's conversation is that it\nseems that there is pretty good reason\nto ex at least explore basic sleep right\nthat that for the non-nappers to to\nreally think about whether or not they\nwould like to explore napping as you\nmentioned they don't have to and then\nfor people who are already um napping to\nreally think about the placement of that\nnap uh within the day and the duration\nof that nap what you told us a few\nmoments ago suggests that I should be\ndoing or anyone that's doing naps or\nentering these Lial States like nsdr\nmight want to shift them a little bit\nearlier than uh the period in which they\nfirst become sleepy to take that nap is\nthat right I mean like so for instance\nshould I do as my colleague and you know\nfinish lunch and and lie down for 10 15\nminutes um rather than wait until 2 or 3\np.m. is that is that something that that\ncould make a meaningful difference I\nthink it could and I think it really\nagain depends on how much of a struggle\nsleep becomes in the evening for you if\nit is becoming the later that you nap if\nyour sleep becomes either a more\ndifficult to initiate in the evening or\nmaybe you don't have any problems\nfalling asleep but for some reason when\nI look back I'm now starting to wake up\nmore throughout the night that in part\nagain it's not just that if you nap late\nin the day you struggle to fall asleep\nyou may not the other consequence that\ncan happen which is non-mutually\nexclusive is that you then stay in not\nas deep as sleep and your sleep is more\nsome more fragile in that sense so the\nprobability that you will wake up\nbecause because you had the nap so late\nin the day is higher in the middle of\nthe night and then when you wake up like\nmany of us do and you go to the restroom\nor It's Perfectly Natural but the speed\nwith which you can then fall back asleep\nis compromised why because you've\njettisoned some of that sleepiness by\nway of the nap and there isn't as much\nto take you back down into sleep after\nyou've woken up so I would just say that\nif you are seeing that pattern that the\nlater napping that you're doing if\nyou're doing that and again there's no\nreason that you need to nap only if you\nchoose to nap if that's the case then\nconsider not necessarily obviating the\nnap that may not be required just bring\nit back earlier take it after lunch see\nhow things work out do the experiment\nand when you do the experiment make sure\nthat you do what I would describe as the\nonof on experiment which is where you're\nnapping as you normally do and you've\nnoticed perhaps some problems with your\nsleep then do so that's sort of the the\nwell it's sort of the on off on phase so\nthen change your nap protocol and move\nit earlier so now you've Switched Off\nYour Standard protocol and you've moved\non to something different so you're on\nyour standard protocol and then you come\noff it and when you come off it meaning\nyou go to an earlier nap and you say\ngosh things do seem to be better maybe\nhe he had something there and it does\nseem to\nimprove good but I don't trust that\nbecause maybe it's just a placebo effect\nthat you you know hear some dulit\nBritish tones and you get convinced that\nmaybe that would work and you've now\ninstead after about two weeks of doing\nthat and things have improved go back to\nyour original schedule go back on to\nyour original protocol I'm not as\ninterested about the fact that things\ngot better when we changed it I'm\ninterested in the question do things get\nworse when we stop it and so when we\nstop the intervention if things got\nworse again now I'm I'm believing it a\nlot more so just as a tip if you are a\nself- tinkerer and you don't have to do\nthat but if you're idiotic like me and a\nscientist and you want to do it with\nthis city riger that's the way I would\nsuggest doing it I don't think it's\nidiotic at all I think it's systematic\nand what you just described is uh both a\nnegative control and a positive control\nexperiment so you're you are a scientist\nthrough and\nthrough are there any individuals that\nshould absolutely avoid napping you know\nI'm heard lore of you know um elderly\nfolks um folks with certain conditions\num you know can't imagine um which but\num I'm sure you'll tell us that for whom\nnapping is harmful to their health it's\na very I think interesting question\nbecause the strongest evidence comes\nback to that which we we've mentioned\nbefore which is insomnia and really the\nrecommendation there is just avoid naps\nit's and what's problematic about\ninsomnia when you are having such tough\ntimes with sleep at night and you are\njust dragging through the day it is\nmiserable and I am you know I I'm very\nprotective of my sleep um for the most\npart I\nsleep pretty well but I've I'm I'm not\nimmune to the vagaries of sleep I've had\ntwo bouts of insomnia throughout my life\nboth have been what we call reactive\ninsomnia reactive to an event or\nsomething happening and I know how just\ndesperate and hungry you are for sleep\nand if it's happening week after week\nmonth after month I'll just do anything\nto get sleep when I can and the\nTemptation therefore to nap when you are\nsuffering from insomnia is that much\nhigher and therefore the advice is that\nmuch harder to adopt but trust me that\nis one of the components that we have in\nthe psychological treatment bucket that\nwe use for insomnia which is called\ncognitive behavioral therapy for\ninsomnia or cbti for short and you can\njust look it up or um on my own podcast\nI done a six-part series on on uh\ninsomnia so I would say try to back away\nin that circumstance but you brought up\na another example which is in aging\nthere I think the evidence is a little\nless causal so you have to be more\ncautious about recommending the absence\nas I was with insomnia of abstaining\nfrom naps but the data has now become\nquite strong that when you get past\nabout 65 years old and you look at\nnapping behavior in large\nepidemiological studies and you say is\nthere a positive benefit in aging for\nnapping or is there no benefit at all\nand they looked at that because they\nthought well that perhaps based on the\nwork in healthy adults that I've\ndescribed that would be good for older\nadults not only did they find that it\nwasn't good they found that it was\ndeleterious that napping in older adults\nwas predictive of worse Health outcomes\nand it also seemed to predict a higher\nlikelihood of early\nmortality so at this point we're\nthinking well how does that fit with\neverything you've been telling us it\ncomes back to this notion of bad sleep\nat night it's probably not necessarily\nthat napping during the day is bad for\nolder\nadults it's that the Naps reflect a\nproblem with the night of sleep for\nolder adults and as we get older\nsomething I didn't mention during\ndevelopment was that yes we get this\nsort of State Lael ratio of 4 to1 of one\npart REM sleep four parts non-rem in our\n7 to9 hours and I described these\nchanges in rem early in development I\ndidn't mention two things about non-rem\nslow wave activity first as we go into\nour teenage years and we shift our sort\nof timing of sleep where we want to go\nto bed later and wake up later that's\nbiologically determined it's not\nteenagers fault something happens with\ntheir deep sleep however their deep\nsleep starts to do a\ndifferent or different action to the\nbrain that REM sleep was doing as an\ninfant I said that during infancy we\nhave huge amounts of REM sleep and were\ngrowing sinapsis syap Genesis and we\nwiring up all of those new territories\nall of these new neighborhoods with\nfiberoptic cable but let's say that\nyou've now run the experiment across\nmany years through until teenagehood of\nthose neighborhoods and you've been\nmeasuring the bandwidth consumption of\neach individual house and you've started\nto realize well I wanted to create a big\nspread across the brain and then I'm\njust going to let experience over the\nnext years time tell me which parts of\nthe brain seem to enjoy that high\nbandwidth and which parts don't seem to\nuse it very much and as we go through\ninto our teenage years we go through\nsomething called synaptic pruning where\nthe brain actually calls and takes away\ncopses from certain parts of the brain\nit seems to be that this change in slow\nwave sleep that happens around these\nadolescent years is performing the act\nof final cortical\nmaturation that it's downscaling the\nsynapses and fine-tuning the brain so\nyou've got this beautiful efficiency and\nnow you've throttled back some of the\nbandwidth from some of those\nneighborhoods because they just don't\nuse it very much and you can move it\nover into the territories that are\ndemanding more bandwidth and net net the\nbrain is downscaled but it's improved\nits efficiency in the sense that those\nregions that need it and are working\nhard based on what we think this\norganism has been doing over the past\nyou know 13 years that's where we need\nto now place our bets but as we get\nthrough into our older years and this\nwill come back to this issue of napping\ndon't\nworry stick with me here folks um the\nreason is that as we're getting older\nour sleep de\ndeines but it's not just all sleep\ndeclines deep sleep declines most\ndramatically and we all think of aging\nfrom brain perspective as cognitive\ndecline that our learning and memory\nabilities begin to fade and Decline and\nthey do but I would argue that a\nphysiological signature of Aging is that\nyour sleep gets worse and particularly\nyour deep sleep what's perhaps\nconcerning for people listening to this\nright now is that that decline in deep\nSleep doesn't start happening in your\n60s or your 50s or even your 40s we can\nstart to pick up that great sleep\ndecline beginning in your mid to late\n30s and then it just decreases and by\nage 50 you are down to about 50% of the\ndeep non-rem sleep that you were having\nwhen you were 17 or 18 by age 65 and\nover or certainly by age 75 you are down\nto about just 5% of the deep sleep that\nyou had when you were 17 or 18 which is\na stunning\ndecline what that means comes back to\nthe first episode we spoke about the\nfour macros of good sleep quantity\nquality timing and regularity one of the\nmeasures of quality that I described to\nyou was this electrical quality of deep\nsleep the other measure of quality sleep\nI spoke about was how consolid ated and\nconsistent your sleep is versus how\nfragmented your sleep is the measure of\nSleep Quality is markedly compromised as\nwe get older we're waking up many more\ntimes our sleep is much more fragmented\nand therefore our sleep efficiency is\nworse and we've got this huge decline in\nour deep non-rm sleep so no wonder then\nwhen you are awake during the day as an\nolder adult Your Sleep Quality is so\ncompr promised at that stage you perhaps\ntry to compensate by way of napping but\nthat compromised quality of sleep that\nyou're having at night is probably the\nreason that you start to get sick more\nthat you have a higher probability of\nillness and disease and why also you\nprobably have a higher risk of premature\nmortality so in other words it's the bad\nquality of sleep at night that leads to\nthis behavior that we call daytime\nnapping in older adults\nthat seems to indirectly suggest oh my\ngoodness it's daytime napping that's bad\nand that causes these problems when in\nfact it's that daytime napping is a\nproxy for the bad sleep that's happening\nat night and it's really the bad sleep\nthat's happening at night that is more\ndirectly related to the health and\nmortality concerns in older adults so\nthat's why I think right now as a field\nI'm still open to evidence that napping\nfor some reason that we just do not\nunderstand right now is problematic and\ndoes causally predict worse health and a\nshorter lifespan in older adults I think\nthe best evidence that we have right now\nis that it's actually the bad quality of\nsleep at night and thus we should not be\nnecessarily jumping to recommendations\nthat all older adults should stop\nnapping I think we need more evidence\nand I'm open to both sides of that let's\ntalk about caffeine uh I've heard the\nter term uh is it\nnapino yeah I I I think it um refers to\na practice of drinking some caffeine\nthen laying down for a nap and then\nsupposedly waking up um feeling more\nrefreshed my understanding and you'll\ntell us more of course is that caffeine\num is effectively an adenosine\nantagonist although it's a competitive\nAgonist and you'll explain I'm sure um\nand napping as you mentioned before uh\nremoves some of the Sleep pressure AKA\nuh wipes away some of that uh adenosine\nthat's accumulated um both of which\nsound great but as you mentioned earlier\nthere's a warning there as well uh the\nwarning label on uh both those things\nshould be that having sufficient\nadenosine built up in your brain is one\nof the ways in which you feel sleepy at\nnight and fall asleep and stay asleep\nyeah so what's the story with caffeine\nhow does it work uh to make us feel more\nalert and\num what is the rationale for the\nnappuccino the nappuccino also known as\nthe caffeine nap caffeine is a very\ninteresting compound in relationship to\nsleep and wake obviously everyone knows\nthat caffeine can help you stay awake\nit's no coincidence that those two words\nthat you've used about these chemical\ncompounds caffeine and adenosine sound\nthe same it's because the re receptor\nthat or the receptor systems that\ncaffeine Targets in your brain are the\nadenosine\nreceptors and you think well Matt was\ntelling me that the more adenosine that\nbuilds up in other words the more\nadenosine that's latching onto those\nadenosine receptors in your brain the\nsleepier that you feel and I'm telling\nyou that caffeine works on those same\nreceptors that doesn't make sense\ncaffeine if it's working on those same\nreceptors should increase your\nsleepiness it doesn't because it when it\nbinds onto those adenosine receptors\nthose welcome sites in the brain it\nsimply blocks them it doesn't deactivate\nthem nor does it activate them it simply\nblocks them so think about it almost a\nlittle bit like um a room that's full of\nchairs and at some point these adenosine\nwhich is one collection of people with\nthe name badges of adenosine they would\nnormally like to come in and start\nsitting down on those seats which are\nthe adenosine receptors and as they sit\ndown on those seats you're building up\nthis signal of sleepiness well caffeine\nwhich is another group of people with\ncaffeine badges they race into the room\nand they start to hijack the seats and\nthey start to sit down on them and all\nof a sudden adenosine can't find any\nseats to sit on so your brain is still\nflooding that room with adenosine so the\nadenosine is still building up but the\nreason that you don't feel sleepy\nanymore when you've had a shot of\ncaffeine is because caffeine is raced in\nit's latched onto the\nreceptors and it has essentially hit the\nmute button on your\nsleepiness so now your brain was\nthinking gosh I've been awake for about\n13 or 14 hours I'm starting to feel it\nI'm just going to take a quick espresso\nshot and you get that you think well\nhang on a second you know 20 30 minutes\nlater I don't feel as tied anymore why\nit's not because caffeine came in and\nremoved the adenosine it didn't caffeine\nhas come in blocked the sights but the\nthe adenosine is still building\nup and then at some point the caffeine\nwors off and therefore not only do you\ngo back to the same level of Denine of\nadenosine that you did 2 hours ago it's\nthat plus the additional 2 hours of\nadenosine that has been building up and\nwhat you experience is something called\na caffeine crash and now you need even\nmore caffeine not just to get you back\nto where you were but to recover the\ncrash that you've had and go\nfurther caffeine in relationship to the\ncaffeine nap though the\nnapino is relevant because of its\ntiming caffeine has an instigating\naction of around uh 12 14 to 17 minutes\nso when you come through in the morning\nand you grab your first cup of coffee\nand within the first four or five\nminutes you you say I just I just feel\nbetter I've just had a couple of sips\nI've had half a cup of coffee and I\nalready feel better I just needed that\nif it's within the first five minutes\nthat you're experiencing that it's got\nnothing to do with the caffeine because\nthe peak plasma concentration of your\ncaffeine is not going to arrive with you\nuntil about you know 12 to 17 minutes so\nwhy do you feel better some of it is\nPlacebo because you're smelling the\ncoffee and you associate it with the L\nit's really not that though or or um\nwhen you say Placebo I also wonder\nwhether or not it's possibly a a\nconditioned effect you know like a\npavlovian thing because the smell of the\ncoffee the taste of the coffee the the\nhum of the machine the walking into the\ncafe\nto to um and ordering it from the\nBarista also creates an anticipatory\narousal like here the the alertness is\ncoming and in that anticipation there's\nits own form of alertness I think that's\nthat's certainly a big component of it\nthe other component however if you look\nat the data is that it's got nothing to\ndo with the caffeine in that moment it's\nthe temperature that most people take\ntheir caffeine warm either it's tea or\nit's coffee or it's perhaps something\nelse that Andrew hubman would drink but\nmany people yamate since since I was 5\nyears old I don't I don't know if I\nshould have been drinking uh caffeine\nyerbamate so young maybe even four years\nold there's a photo of me on my\ngrandfather's lap drinking out of the\nmate gourd half my family is Argentine\nand um so I was caffeinated from a young\nage this brain developed in a\ncaffeinated millu this explains so much\nabout what I've known of you over these\nno I'm kidding you um so um but we need\nto speak later no so what's interesting\nabout that is it's the\ntemperature and I told you in the first\nepisode that we need to cool down\nto stay asleep but we need to initially\nwarm up to fall asleep because warming\nup at that moment I was telling you is\nwarming up at the periphery a warm up to\ncool down to fall asleep so you need to\nwarm up to cool down to fall asleep then\nyou need to stay cool to stay asleep and\nthen you need to warm up to wake up the\nwarming up to cool down to fall asleep\nis not warming up in the middle deep\ncore of your body it's about warming up\nthe hands and the feet and the head to\ndissipate the heat hence warm up the\nouter surfaces to cool down the inner\ncore to fall asleep but then I told you\nyou have to warm up to wake up and when\nwe take a hot drink in the morning\nusually caffeinated the change in your\ncore body temperature can happen with\nwithin a handful of minutes so the\ninitial benefit that you get from the\nhot cup of coffee in the morning or hot\ntea is from the temperature rise and\nthen you get this beautiful second kick\nfrom the caffeine itself and that\ncaffeine can then sustain for a longer\nperiod of\ntime so we mentioned this problem with\nnapping that even at 25 or 30 minutes of\na nap you wake up with that kind of\ngrogginess that sleep\ninertia and what however if I could give\nyou the benefits of a nap and have you\ncome out of the nap with zero sleep\ninertia and that's what some folks\nstarted to cleverly think\nabout what if I could look at the timing\nof the optimal nap maybe 20 minutes and\nthink about the timing of when Peak\nplasma concentration of caffeine emerges\nand I told you really starts to kick\ninto gear around 17 minutes and it's in\nfull swing by 20 what if I was creative\nI'm going to withhold from saying\nidiotic enough but creative enough to\nget into bed just before I turn the\nlight out for my nap in the afternoon I\nSwig a quick\nespresso light goes\noff I close my eyes eye mask earplugs\nand I'm going to drift off fine because\nthe the caffeine is not going to kick in\nand for another 17 20 minutes perhaps at\nits full threshold so now you you fall\nin to sleep and you're going down into\nsleep and if you perhaps don't make it\ntoo large in terms of its serving the\ntemperature change is not going to\naffect you in a negative way and then\njust as your alarm clock is about to go\noff after 20 minutes you're on the\nbeautiful ascending swing of upward\nplasma concentration of caffeine and you\nget ejected out the other side with both\nthe benefits of the nap together with\nthe benefits of the caffeine so you get\nyour cake and you can eat it too you get\nthe nap absent the Sleep inertia and\nhence this created what we call the\ncaffeine nap I love it the nappuccino\nthe the nappuccino um maybe I'll give it\na try uh this is the first time I've\never heard the um the rationale and the\nthe the fine structure of the nappuccino\nbut it makes sense um uh at a logical\nand mechanistic level I have to ask is\nthere anything besides caffeine and\nsleep that can clear\nadenosine you know can exercise clear\nadenosine can uh cold shower clear\nadenosine I mean and I understand that\nthere are a bunch of competing\nmechanisms in the body like presumably a\nspike in norepinephrine or adrenaline or\nboth is going to impact the adenosine\nsystem I I once heard a great quote um\nfrom a former uh\nmember of the National Academy of\nSciences a brilliant guy he said you\nknow a a drug is a substance that when\ninjected into an animal or a human\nproduces a scientific publication\nmeaning meaning it is it is rare to find\na paper that doesn't see some effect of\nsome drug especially on sleep I'm told\nas I recall if you put aspirin REM sleep\ninto PubMed you're going to see some\neffect on REM sleep people take asper\npretty much any substance that one takes\nis going to to alter um some feature of\nsleep or of wakeful States if one is\nlooking with a fine enough uh instrument\nor is that an overstatement no I don't\nthink it is an overstatement and it\ncomes back to the first episode where we\ndescribed the complexity this incredible\nbeautiful physiological ballet certainly\none of the recommendations when people\nsay I get this afternoon this post\nprandy will drop in my alertness what\ncan I do I say you could nap but another\nway is just get outside and walk around\nbe physically active some of that has to\ndo with the fact that you'll probably\nget some daylight and daylight can be a\nstimulator of alertness as long you've\ntold us and educated us on we also know\nthat physical activity by itself can\nincrease the amount of endorphins and\ndorphin and those are wake promoting but\nnone of those are really necessarily\ngoing to be altering adenosine they're\nsimply overriding the adenosine that is\nstill building up it really does seem to\nbe for the most part at least as all\nthat I know it's only sleep and\nparticularly non-rem sleep that has the\ncapacity to or give the brain the chance\nto remove that adenosine now what could\nbe interesting I think is two\ncircumstances one is where your brain\nbecomes less metabolically active for\nanother reason and I told you that it's\nnot joring it's not as though during\ndeep non-rm sleep that there is some\nspecial pulsing cleansing mechanism for\nadenosine there is a cleansing system\ncalled the glymphatic system which\nremoves the toxic metabolic byproducts\nof the waking day wakefulness in some\nways is biochemically low-level brain\ndamage and sleep is sanitary salvation\nin that regard knew um but which is\nagain it's humoristic and it's it's it's\ngoing too far but it makes a point the\nidea here however is that it's not that\nthere is a special system that is\nremoving the adenosine during deep nonm\nsleep it's just that your brain is less\nmetabolically active and therefore it's\nnot producing as much adenosine so the\nnatural mechanisms that are always\noccurring in the background to be\nclearing adenosine and degrading it\nsimply get the chance to do that just as\neffectively as they have but you're no\nlonger working against the opposite tide\nthat is growing the adenosine now the\nadenosine increase has dissipated\nbecause you're no long longer\nmetabolically active during deep sleep\nand you get the chance to cleanse it all\nof which is to say therefore that and\nthat would mimic that such as for\nexample anesthesia my guess is that you\nprobably do jettison some sleep pressure\nwhen you are in\nanesthesia I also think that these Lial\nStates non sleep deep rest could be a\nfascinating territory there because at\nthat point I'm going to guess and we'll\nbe able to see with the e G and we may\nalso be able to do some Imaging\ndepending on how we you and I design the\nstudy to look at what changes in the\nbrain in terms of its activation State\nmy guess is that if it does put you into\nsomething like slow wave activity\npatterns that means that those\nterritories of the brain are\nmetabolically less active and that\nallows the brain to dissipate the\nadenosine so to your point I don't think\nthings like necessarily exercise or\nlight change a Denine level\nthey do give a nice alertness benefit\nfor other reasons but is there an\nalternative way of dissipating adenosine\nyes I think anything that mimics a non\nor less metabolically active brain could\nproduce these beautiful adenosine\nbenefits thank you for that this brings\nme to a question about the period\nimmediately after waking from the\nnightly bout of sleep um I've been uh\ntouting the benefits of delaying one's\ncaffeine intake by 90 to 120 minutes\nafter waking there's a little bit of a\nmisconception out there I think people\num ran with the ball uh assuming that I\nwas mandating this or think or\nsuggesting that everyone should do this\nand that's simply not the case uh I\nactually wake up and I'll hydrate and\ndrink caffeine very close to waking if\nI'm going to exercise soon after yeah um\nwhich I often do um but I've experienced\nand I know others um have experienced if\nthey are not going to exercise\nimmediately or they don't need caffeine\nto exercise for whatever reason I've\nheard these people exist I'm no such M\nmutant um that delaying their caffeine\nintake by 90 to 120 Minutes in some\ncases can offset the afternoon crash now\nI want to be clear some of that may be\noffsetting the afternoon consumption of\nmore caffeine because by delaying your\ncaffeine intake in the morning then\nperhaps there's less of an incentive or\nrequirement to drink caffeine in the\nafternoon and all of which dominoes to\nas we'll talk about more in the series\nto better sleep at night because you\nyou're not ingesting caffeine close to\nbedtime but at risk of taking a massive\ntangent here's what I'd like to know\nbased on what you just told\nus if\nindeed\nsleep and\nlower metabolic activity in certain\nbrain regions can help reduce adenosine\nlevels in the\nbrain one could imagine that upon\nwaking it is either a step function from\nokay you know let's say at um 5:45 a.m.\nsomebody is asleep and adenosine is\nstill being cleared away because they're\nasleep and then they wake up boom does\nadenosine clearance immediately stop\nwell for people who have that um\ncrumpled face uh grogginess um and they\nwake up at 5:45 maybe even by way of\nalarm although we don't uh suggest that\nright and they stagger into the kitchen\nand um ordinarily they'd make their cup\nof coffee but they're in a pseudo sleep\nstate so it stands to reason that\nthey're still clearing adenosine now if\nthey are to drink caffeine right away\nthen they're as you pointed out going to\nblock those adenosine receptors and\nthere's going to be a continued buildup\nof adenosine as opposed to a clearance\nof adenosine so this was um part not the\nentire reason but part of the rationale\nfor suggesting that people at least\nexplore delaying caffeine slightly and\nthen there are things like the cortisol\nrise and Etc but um does that kind of\nframework at least make logical sense\nthat doesn't mean it would hold up in a\nrandomized controlled trial but given\nthat we're talking about essentially\nzero risk protocols here um what are\nyour thoughts on that I think it is good\nadvice for people to test and it's good\nadvice for two reasons the first is that\nwhich you describe in some ways by\ntaking caffeine on early and masking\nthat\nadenosine also caffeine can make your\nbrain more metabolically active which\nmeans that you're going to build up more\nadenosine during the day which means\nthat sleepiness is going to arrive\nearlier which means that perhaps that\npostprandial drop is going to be you\nknow harsher and you're going to perhaps\nthen need to self-medicate with more\ncaffeine to and so goes the Vicious\nCycle so I think that's one thing to\nkeep in mind I think that's one\nhypothesis I think the second hypothesis\nfor me or the second reason I would\nadvocate for that is if you've been\nusing caffeine that way for a long\nperiod of time you may also be\nmasking the quality of your sleep\nbecause you wake up you immediately\nmedicate with caffeine and you are alert\nyou're awake and you think well I\nlooking back on my night I'm awake now\nafter my caffeine and now is the\nimportant part of that sentence I'm\nawake now so there's nothing wrong with\nmy sleep is that true maybe it is maybe\nit's not maybe if you abstain from\ncaffeine through and you have to get\nthrough the detox period it's not going\nto this is not the right test\nimmediately but do it for about two\nweeks and then at that point once you're\nfree from the detox and the withdrawal\nnow you're in a somewhat naive state\nwhere you're taking your caffeine on I'm\ntelling you to stop caffeine you're\ntaking it on at 11:00 after you've woken\nup let's say 7:00 in the morning at that\npoint we've now got this nice Clear\nWindow that has been consistently\nhappening between 7 to 11: in the\nmorning and I'm going to ask you now do\nyou feel rested restored and refreshed\nand can you operate with cognitive\nacumen and\nskill in those first morning hours now\ndon't forget we've got to get past the\nnatural sleep and Heria period in the\nfirst 90 minutes but after the first 90\nminutes of waking up absent of caffeine\nlet's say by 900 a.m. in the morning are\nyou functioning well because if you're\nnot and you still think you know what I\ndon't feel restored by my sleep I feel\nunrefreshed I want to then start asking\nyou let's take a look at your sleep and\nlet's see how we can get you to a more\nrefreshed state\nand by using caffeine first thing in the\nmorning you don't give yourself the\nchance to test whether or not\nsubjectively you sense your sleep is\ngood quality now you don't need to do\nthis forever you can just do a test for\na month and be asking that question and\nif all is clear after you've got through\nwithdrawal and you've got past the first\n90 minutes after waking up and you tell\nme now in this more caffeine naive state\nin the first few hours I feel rest I\nfeel refreshed I feel restored by my\nsleep then that's great we don't need to\nbe concerned about your sleep so that's\nthe second reason I like it because it\ngives you the opportunity to test out\nwhether or not your sleep is of good\nquality or not I should also note by the\nway that I mentioned I've changed my\nmind on caffeine and its use and this\ncomes back to I just raise it because\nyou had said I made this suggestion and\nit wasn't binary it wasn't dictatorial\nyou don't have to to do it I wasn't\nsaying that everyone needs to do it and\nin fact even I will you know tweak my\nschedule if I'm doing one thing in the\nmorning I will take on board caffeine\nfairly soon if I'm not I will hold\noff I came out the gate when I first\npublished um a book and it and I was\nvery dictatorial about it I and I was\nvery mono I was very binary you know it\nwas sleep is absolute and it's\nit has to be this way and no other way I\nwas not in favor of caffeine and I was\ntelling people about the dangers and\nthere are dangers to your sleep and we\nwe can speak about those but it was a\nlittle bit too\nheavy-handed I've changed my mind for at\nleast two reasons\nfirst that's not the way Society works\nor people live so there's no amount just\nlike technology in saying leave your\nphone outside of the room for 2 hours\nbefore bed and don't check it for the\nfirst 4 hours that that Genie is out the\nbottle so the reason I have changed my\nmind on caffeine is because if you look\nat the data on on caffeine it's stunning\nfor\nHealth it on almost every metric that we\ncan measure drinking some degree of\ncaffeine is beneficial now there is a I\nknew it there is a U-shaped function to\nthis which is once you get past sort of\nthree or four cups of coffee then you\nstart to go in the downward Direction\nand things aren't so great the\ncontradiction however was that I was\ntelling people caffeine not good for\nyour sleep and sleep by the way is\nwonderful for Health it transacts all of\nthese benefits that we have and will\ndiscuss in this series but then you\ncompare that relative to caffeine and\ncaffeine transacts many of the same\nhealth benefits so how can you explain\nthat Mr sleep\nscientist well if you look the the data\nis very clear it's not the caffeine\nthat's the benefit most people take on\nboard caffeine by way of a cup of\ncoffee and the Coffee Bean is Pack full\nnot just of caffeine it contains a\nwhopping dose of\nantioxidants and because of our\ndeficient Western diets were so absent\nof these\nantioxidants that the humble cup of\ncoffee has been asked to carry the\nHerculean weight of our antioxidant\nneeds on its shoulders so no wonder it\nby itself carries such a strong Health\nsignal because it's providing you with\nthis wonderful dose of antioxidants in\naddition to caffeine case in point if\nyou look at decaffeinated coffee you\nstill get the antioxidants but now now\nyou don't get the caffeine and lo and\nbehold you get many of the same health\nbenefits it's not the caffeine it's the\ncoffee itself so I think that is a a\nperfectly good reason to justify\ncaffeine but again just like naps the\ndose and the timing make the poison if\nyou're not someone who's sensitive to\ncaffeine then having a couple of cups of\ncaffeine and trying to step away from\nthe use of caffeine I would argue\nsomewhere between 10 to 12 hours before\nyou expect to go to bed depending on\nyour sensitivity and it is different\nacross people and we know that it's\ngenetic there is a specific um what we\ncall polymorphism which just means A\nvariation in a particular Gene and if\nyou look at variations in that it will\npredict whether you are someone who is\nvery sensitive to caffeine or not very\nsensitive to caffeine and it comes down\nto how quickly you can essentially\nmetabolically remove that caffeine from\nthe system so if you know that you're a\nvery sensitive person I would probably\nargue try to stay clear maybe 12 to 14\nhours if you're someone who is not as\nsensitive then you could maybe go to 8\nhours the danger is for people who say\nlook I'm one of those people who is you\nknow really just not sensitive to\ncaffeine at all and I can have an\nespresso with dinner and I fall asleep\nfine I stay asleep fine so it's really\nnot a problem for me I would say that\nthat that may be true but the inherent\ndanger here is that and we've done these\nstudies if I give you a dose of let's\nsay 200 300 400 milligrams of of\ncaffeine in the hours before bed which\nwould be a large you know strong cup of\ncoffee or you know two espresso with\ndinner some people can fall asleep and\nsome people stay asleep but the amount\nof deep sleep that they have is\ncompromised in fact it can drop your\ndeep sleep by up to 20% now the danger\nis that you wake up in the morning and\nthere was no signals in your sleep that\nsaid you had problematic sleep because\nyou're not aware of how much deep sleep\nthat you had that's the reason that I\nthink you know sleep trackers can be\nhelpful in some ways but you then wake\nup and you don't feel as refreshed and\nrestored but you don't remember having a\nhard time falling asleep or staying\nasleep but now you find yourself\nreaching for three cups of coffee to\nwake up in the morning rather than the\nstandard two and so goes the Vicious\nCycle\nso and also you see an interesting\ninterrelationship we did a recent study\nwe just published in Wall Street Traders\nit's not just caffeine use it's also\nabout alcohol use in the evening that\npeople who overmedicate with caffeine\nduring the day they then need something\nto bring them down at night and the\nprincipal depressant agent and\ndepressant not in the sense of\npsychiatric depression but in the sense\nof brain neural activity depression is\nis alcohol so you get this classic cycle\nof uppers and downers I need my uppers\nduring the morning my caffeine and I\nneed my downers at night to lull me into\nsleep and it's this really interesting\ntrade-off which we we saw in these Wall\nStreet Traders so coming back to the\nnotion of caffeine though I am favorable\nof it in terms of its health benefits I\nthink it's very very clear just be\nmindful of the dose and be mindful of\nthe timing dose try to not exceed about\nthree cups of coffee timing understand\nyour sensitivity there are certain\ngenetic tests if you really want to get\nnerdy that will tell you if you have\nthis sensitivity or not but you will\nprobably know it and therefore just say\nokay I'm not that sensitive I could\nprobably go 8 hours or as close as 8\nhours before sleep or 10 hours if you're\nvery sensitive 14 15 hours and keep it\nto one cup um so those are the ways that\nI would see moderating caffeine and\nchanging my my mind on caffeine which\njust comes back to your point where you\nwere saying I made this recommendation\nabout caffeine I want to make sure I\nmodify that so people don't get confused\nI certainly um needed to make a\nmodification to my stance on caffeine so\nthank you for letting me say that which\nis a long uh winded way of of getting\naround it but does that help a little\nbit that does help it um very much thank\nyou for that um addendum to the\nlegislature\n[Laughter]\nokay so you told us about the power nap\nand you've told us about the caffeine\nnap the so-called napino yeah what are\nsome other types of naps that can be\nbeneficial for Sleep awake cycles and\nalertness so you can think about the\ncaffeine nap as trying to amplify it\nsort of a nap plus as it were but to\nyour question the study that comes to\nmind there was a brilliant investigation\nHerculean in its study design from a\ngreat sleep research group out in Japan\nand they asked okay the nap is good the\ncaffeine nap may be a little bit better\nbut can we go\nfurther um and so they designed a series\nof studies they had five different\nexperimental groups and they tried to\nbasically create a stack a stacking\nsystem they had across the five groups\nthere was a non naap group that's the\ncontrol then there was a nap group then\nthere was a nap plus caffeine group then\nthere was a nap Plus Cold face and cold\nhandwashing immediately after you wake\nup I'll come back to explain why that we\nthink that works and then the final\ngroup was a group that was a nap plus\nbright light and again thank you uh me\noffering this as the general public to\nyou Andrew hubman for for your light\nRevolution so it was bright light at\n2,000 looks immediately afterwards so\nthey had five groups again there was no\nnap group nap group nap plus caffeine\nnap plus cold hands and face washing nap\nplus immediate brightlight the cold\nhands and face washing is interesting I\ntold you before that there was this\nthree-part story to to the sleep wake\nequation that you need to warm up to\ncool down to fall asleep stay cool to\nstay asleep warm up to wake up and I'm\nsaying warm up to wake up but use cold\nwater on your face and your\nhands don't forget that warming up when\nI say it in the morning is warming up at\nthe central core of your body you\nreverse engineer what you did in the\nevening I said warm up to cool down to\nfall asleep so you warm up the periphery\nto release the blood from the core and\nyou cool down well the reason that they\nuse cold hand and face\nwashing was because that's this vascular\nsurface it's the place where we can\nmodulate temperature quite quickly the\ncold water on the face and the hands\ntherefore caused a Vaso\nconstriction the the vessels and the\ncapillaries there they all scrunched up\nand they force the blood back down into\nthe core of the body so the core body\ntemperature increase a little bit now\nyou also get a bit of an adrenaline shot\nwhen you're splashing very cold water on\nyour hands and your face so there's some\nof that too but that's the justification\nso what they find firstly they were\nmeasuring different aspects of your\ncognition and your mood and your\nsleepiness those were the outcome\nmeasures to assess how did these five\ndifferent experimental groups change and\nyou can imag I mean this is I don't\nthink I would ever take on a study where\nI'm doing five nap groups all within one\nstudy it's bloody amazing so they did\nthe nonap group and then compared to the\nnonap group The Nap group got a\nwonderful benefit just as we described\nand they showed benefits in their\nalertness in their cognitive performance\nand also they showed a reduction in\ntheir sleepiness so Point number one on\nthe scoreboard for a nap then they did\nthe nap plus the\ncaffeine and sure enough you got an\nadded benefit to that which you already\nobtained from the nap now it was nowhere\nnear as sizable as the benefit from the\nnap so the addition of caffeine does\ngive you some nice benefits and I've\nused this before when I've worked with\nsort of professional athletes we do\ninstigate these nap um these caffeine\nnaps when needed so it did give a nice\nbenefit but then when they looked at the\nnap Plus Cold hand and face washing and\nthe nap plus the bright light those also\nadded something to The Nap benefit now\nthey didn't do the sixth Group which is\nreally what I'm going to do some hand\nwaving about which is the full step\nstack full fat method where they said\nokay you're going to do nap plus\ncaffeine Plus Cold hand and face washing\nplus bright light but if you were to put\nthose together my thought is that\nthey're probably additive rather than\nsimply just you know netting each other\nout which means that if you really want\nto not just do a nap or a nap plus which\nwould be the the Caffe nap but the nap\nplus plus version you can lean into this\nstudy and the protocol there would be\nyou get into bed you have your espresso\nshot before you turn the light you Swig\nit go down set your alarm for 20 minutes\nyou wake up the caffeine is kicking in\nyou get over the inertia you go straight\nout cold hands cold face by way of cold\nwater and then you get immediate\ndaylight for 5 to 10 minutes outside and\nat that point you're really in a\nsupercharged state so that's if you just\nbecause I know there's probably going to\nbe some audience members who are willing\nto give this a try or who really want to\noptimize don't give me you know what is\ngood give me the extreme very best\nthat's the only suggestion I would have\nbased on that data I love it and\nactually what you just described could\neasily be um translocated to the uh the\nperiod after uh waking from the nightly\nbout of sleep although one wouldn't\ningest caffeine prior to waking up for\nobvious reasons um but it would make\ngood sense to me to uh wake up obviously\nget sunlight in one's eyes um splash\nsome cold water in one's face or hands\nor get cold shower cold plunge um\ncaffeine or delay caffeine I mean it's\nessentially the same set of tools and I\nthink it really um points to the fact\nthat circadian rhythm clearance of\nadenosine uh temperature modulation and\nof course the the way in which these\ninteract um are really the the levers\nand and knobs to to modulate wakefulness\nyeah it's it's so it there are I think\nwe've gone over this notion of naps but\nthere are ways that you can try to\nmanipulate the nap system still and\nthere are ways that you can manipulate\nit even further but I like what you're\nsaying because it just comes back to the\nfundamentals let's let's forego the the\nnap conversation just go back to the\nmorning routine you're absolutely right\nand think about the cold water and\nwarmart my guess is that very few people\nwhen they go to bed\nthey wash their face and their hands\nmaybe they're probably not washing it\nwith cold water before they go to bed\ncorrect they're going to be washing it\nwith warm water why don't they do that\nand they just say well why would I\nSplash cold water on my face you know\nprobably wakes me up you ever thought\nabout why it wakes you up part of it is\nthe you know the shot of activation but\nthe other part is Thermo regulation and\nthe opposite is what what you want to do\nif anything you want to be warming your\nhands and your feet and that's exactly\nwhat you've always done you've always\nmedicated your sleep onset by using warm\nwater on your face and your hands\nseveral times during today's discussion\nwe talked about polyphasic sleep um and\nthe different types of polyphasic sleep\nthat we covered are I wouldn't say\nconventional but they're um conventional\nis what are some of the more um esoteric\nor let's call them high performance Pol\npolyphasic uh strategies uh for sleep so\nwe've spoken about polyphasic sleep in\nthe natural way it occurs which is\nduring infancy and sleeping like a baby\nmeans that you're sleeping in a highly\npolyphasic way but probably around about\nthe late 1990s 2000s with the emergence\nof the biohacker movement and the\nQuantified\nself-movement there started to become a\nlot of chatter online about this notion\nof polyphasic sleep and here no longer\nare we infants we're now adults but\nwe're engaging in a pattern that is\nhighly\npolyphasic polyphasic sleep simply by\ndefinition again means that you're\nhaving multiple phases of sleep within a\n24-hour period And there are different\nstrategies so the way polyphasic sleep\nin adults works is that you take the\n24-hour period and you think about it\nlike a pie chart and then you start to\nslice that pie up into these quadrants\nwhen it comes to polyphasic sleep the\ngoal is to put insert multiple phases of\nsleep around the 24-hour clock rather\nthan one single phase but the thinness\nof those slices of the pie are very thin\nleaving large thick slices of\nwakefulness in between the notion that\nbeing that if you were to sort of just\nintersperse Little soupson of sleep in\nterms of these little thin slices of\nsleep you can increase the amount of\ntime that you're awake and you can\nincrease all of the benefits of a wake\nso if you look at the there is a website\nI think it's called the polyphasic\nsociety and there it's not a scientific\nSociety like the you know psychological\nthe American Association for uh\npsychology or medical um American\nMedical Association or British medic\nit's not one of those ratified certified\nscientific or medical it's just society\nthat lives online which is great and\nthey make claims to suggest that\npolyphasic sleep can improve aspects of\nyour mood it can improve aspects of your\nproductivity it can maybe even improve\naspects of Health I think sometimes\nthere are claims that it can help with\nlifespan and there are a number of\ndifferent schedules that they will\ndescribe to you and that you can find\nout there of polyphasic sleep there is\nis the first one that probably people\nhave heard of is called the uberman\nschedule and by the way there is no h at\nthe start of that it is simply you I\nknow it's not this man sitting across\nfrom me who has anything to do with this\nschedule and after we discuss the data\nhe will um reassert that very same fact\nthen there's something called the\nEveryman shedule and then there is the\ntriphasic schedule and there's lots of\ndifferent other flavors of this the\ndifferences between them are in how you\nsplit up that pie chart and how much you\nassign to little thin slices of sleep\nversus longer periods of wake and how\nmany of those you insert but they all\nfollow the same pattern if you look at\nthe literature however it didn't begin\nwith the biohacker movement the first\ndescription I can find in the human\nrecord comes from Time Magazine an issue\nin\n1943 and they describe the protocol of\nat the time a fantastic very interesting\ndesigner a guy called book Minster\nFuller and he created a design principle\nand that design principle was called the\ndaxian principle the daxian principle\nwas principally used initially to build\nunique building structures and it uses\nthis notion of different sort of almost\nspokes that interconnect in a central\nHub that create a self-supporting\nstructure are the most obvious have you\never been to one of those geodesic domes\nand inside you go in it's like a\nbotanical garden and it's all tropical\ndespite you being in a let's say being\nin England in London and is beautifully\ntropical inside of that that structure\nthat sort of latice structure that comes\nin part from his Design This was the\ndaxian principle and he scaled it to\ndifferent things the daxian car the\ndaxian house the daxian Dome it\nfascinating\nbut he was no fan of sleep and he saw\nsleep as a rather significant waste of\ntime when just like the rest of his\ndaxian principle he could be harnessing\nmore efficiency out of the system with\nless structure and here less sleep\nstructure inserted into his 24-hour\nperiod so he was the first one to\ndescribe his schedule and it was called\nthe daxian schedule of polyphasic sleep\nso it may have been a practice earlier\nin the record but that's the earliest\none I can find so let's come back to the\nclaims of polyphasic sleep that it could\nimprove let's say your mood or your\ncognition or your productivity or your\nhealth the a group of scientists at\nHarvard some of my old colleagues um\nfrom Harvard they looked at all of the\nliterature on all of the stes that were\npolyphasic like or testing this\nclaim and the first thing that they\nfound was to their claims of improved\ncognition productivity mood as well as\nhealth they found no supportive evidence\nthat polyphasic sleep was helpful then\nthey turned the tables and they said\nwell could it be hurtful and in fact\nthat's exactly what they found firstly\nthe total amount of sleep that you get\non any one of those schedules is\ndecreased significantly now of course\nthat's the goal the quality of sleep\nthat you get though is miserable your\nsleep efficiency even when you're having\nthese short periods of time especially\nduring the waking hours is very poor\nit's not a type of even short sleep that\nyou would wish for third they found that\nit would reduce your REM sleep amounts\nso that was the first set of findings\nyour sleep is no better if anything it's\nsignificantly worse and then they\nstarted to find that there were\nsignificant impairments in many of those\nthings impairments in cognition in\njudgment making and decision- making\nimpairment in mood and some aspects of\nimpairment in metabolic Health\nparticularly glucose\nregulation so when it comes to\npolyphasic sleep sleeping like a baby if\nyou're an adult seems to be a rather\nunwise piece of advice now yeah I mean\nit probably goes along with eating baby\nfood drinking breast milk and um and uh\nhaving somebody else uh clothe and\nchange you as an adult it's probably uh\nnot advisable\nit doesn't seem to be at least supported\nby the data and again I want to be so\ncareful here and you're very careful too\nI'm not here to necessarily tell anyone\nabsolutely how to live their life I'm\njust a scientist and all I can do is\ngive you the information just as you do\nand then it's up to you to make the best\ndecisions that you wish to make all I\nwould say is that I would hope that as\nlong as you're not hurting yourself and\nharming your health and you're not\nhurting other people then and it makes\nyou happy then I say whatever it is in\nlife good luck I I embrace it I always\nsay uh do as do as you wish but know\nwhat you're\ndoing and don't hurt yourself or anybody\nelse can you get me that T-shirt and I\nwill wear it five days through Tuesday\nso here in this regard though I would\nsay the evidence would suggest that\nmaybe you're compromising your health\nand your Wellness but that's your choice\nvoice and I understand it so again no\njudgment to the question however of as\nlong as you're not hurting other people\nhere I would say that there is a pause\nof a caution because what we know is\nthat when you're not getting sufficient\nsleep I described all of the health\nconsequences in the first episode\nthere's another danger here which is\nroad traffic accidents and we describe\nthese micro sleeps that happen and why\ncar accidents that are caused by\nsleepiness can be so catastrophic\nthere's a very interesting study that\nwas done where they looked at people\ngetting less than 6 hours of sleep for\nseveral nights and they put them into a\ndriving simulator and they asked what is\nthe probability that you have a crash or\nan off-road event and sleeping less than\n6 hours a night resulted in a 30%\nincrease in you getting into a car\ncrash now the AAA release some data\nshowing that when you get down to 5\nhours of sleep there is I think it's\nsomething like two Three Times Higher\nlikelihood of an accident based on real\ndata and then when you were on 4 hours\nof sleep it was close to a 10 times\ngreater risk so in other words the less\nand less sleep that you get it's not a\nlinear increase in your risk of a car\naccident it's an exponential increase so\nI bring this back to polyphasic sleep\nbecause I don't know you know think\nabout that 30% study let's not go to the\nextreme just less than 6 hours of sleep\nif this evening you call a taxi and it\nturns out two taxis turned up and\noutside of your door I said look one of\nthese two ta you can choose either one\nof them but I'll just tell you that one\nof these taxis has a 30% higher\nlikelihood of getting in a crash\nrelative to the other and it's this one\non the right which would you like to\npick which would you like to put your\nwife and children in to S it's very\nobvious so I rais that question just to\nbe mindful no one would wish to cause\nharm on someone else to C carry the harm\nof someone else by way of your own doing\non your shoulders for the rest of your\nlife is not one I would wish for and\nit's not one that you would wish for\nthat's the only cautionary note but\nother than that I would say you know\nsort of live life to the full well that\nbrings us to the conclusion of yet\nanother incredible Voyage into the\nlandscape of sleep most notably on the\ndifferent phases monophasic biphasic and\npolyphasic sleep\nand naps and caffeine and all of their\ninteractions these are such important\ntopics at the level of Concepts the\nlevel of mechanisms and as you've also\nbeautifully described at the level of\nprotocols that is actionable tools that\npeople can apply so thank you ever so\nmuch Matt for taking us even further\nalong this Voyage I'll just remind\npeople that episodes one and two of this\nseries that U Matt is uh so generously\nproviding information about sleep for us\nare out and those can be accessed\nthrough links in the show note captions\num those fill in yet other mechanisms\nand aspects of sleep and I'm also\nparticularly excited for the fourth\ninstallment in this series coming up\nabout the relationship between sleep\nmemory and creativity so just incredibly\nimportant topics relevant to everybody I\nalso just want to make note that I\nreally appreciate you highlighting some\nof the develop velopmental shifts that\noccur with sleep I often get questions\nabout um you know sleep in children and\nbabies and uh elderly adults as well as\num all the ages in between and you've\njust um built this incredible tapestry\nof of information for people to think\nabout and act upon should they choose so\nthank you Matt ever so much and I look\nforward to episode four Andrew thank you\nit is such a privilege and it remains\njust my absolute Delight to be here with\nyou thank you thank you for joining me\nfor today's episode with Dr Matthew\nWalker to learn more about Dr Walker's\nresearch and to
