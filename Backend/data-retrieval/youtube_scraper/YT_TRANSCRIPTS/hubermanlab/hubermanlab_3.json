    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Matthew\nHill Dr Matthew Hill is a professor of\nCell Biology and Anatomy at the\nUniversity of Calgary his laboratory\nstudies cannabis and its effects on\nstress its effects on feeding and its\neffects on the behavioral impacts of\ncannabis exposure at different stages of\ndevelopment the origin of today's\npodcast episode is a bit unique so I'd\nlike to share a little bit of that\nbackground with you previously I did a\nsolo episode of The hubman Lab podcast\nabout cannabis the biology of cannabis\nsome of its medical applications and\nuses as well as some of its potential\nharms that episode came out several\nyears ago now and remains a very popular\nepisode it's had millions of views and\nmillions of listens several months ago\nwe posted a clip of that episode to X\nformerly known as Twitter and Dr Matthew\nHill responded to that clip on X with\ncriticism about the specific points made\nwithin that clip most notably my\ndiscussion of the data that cannabis use\ncan in some individuals cause psychosis\nhe also took issue with some of the\nspecific points I Made In that clip\nrelated to potential differences in the\nbiology of the effects of different\nstrains of cannabis most notably Inda\nversus Sativa strains and a few other\npoints as well now now as somebody who's\nbeen in the field of science for several\ndecades now I'm very familiar with the\nfact that every field every single field\nwithin science has debates within it\ncontroversies and sometimes outright\nbattles and to me that's part of what\nmakes science interesting it's an\nevolving process it's something for\nwhich we should all be very curious to\ntry and understand what we know what we\ndon't know and try and get to the real\nanswers so right off the bat on X I\ninvited Dr Hill onto the podcast and he\naccepted the invitation so today's\nepisode is really a unique one in that\nfirst of all we cover an enormous amount\nof biology and clinical data as it\nrelates to cannabis meaning today's\ndiscussion is not a debate it is really\nan up-to-date discussion about how\ncannabis works so we talk about THC\nversus CBD we address the question of\nwhether or not indas versus sativas have\ndifferent biological and subjective\neffects or not we of course talk about\nthe potential correlation maybe even\ncausation between cannabis use and Psych\nis I think you'll find that discussion\nvery interesting and we talk about how\ncannabis relates to hunger to memory to\nanxiety and to the treatment of anxiety\nI'm certain that given the widespread\nuse of cannabis nowadays that you'll\nfind the discussion to be both an\ninformative and potentially useful one\nthat could help guide decisions as to\nwhether or not you or other should or\nshould not use or avoid cannabis as well\nas one that can simply inform about this\nvery interesting compound and of course\nyou'll learn a lot of neuros science and\nbiology along the way before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\non this podcast about the critical need\nto get sleep both enough sleep and\nenough quality sleep now one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis that your body temperature actually\nhas to drop by about 1 to 3Â° in order\nfor you to fall and stay deeply asleep\nand to wake up feeling refreshed your\nbody temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3 degrees one of\nthe best ways to ensure all of that\nhappens is to control the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment and with Aid\nsleep it's very easy to do that you\nprogram the temperature that you want at\nthe beginning middle and the end of the\nnight and that's the temperature that\nyou're going to sleep bat and it will\ntrack your sleep it tells you how much\nslow wave sleep you're getting how much\nrapid eye movement sleep you're getting\nwhich is critical and all of that also\nhelps you dial in the exact parameters\nyou need in order to get the best\npossible night sleep for you I've been\nsleeping on an eights Sleep mattress\ncover for well over 3 years now and it\nhas completely transform my sleep for\nthe better eight sleep recently launched\ntheir newest generation pod cover the\nPod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra cover has\nimproved cooling and heating capacity\nhigher Fidelity sleep tracking\ntechnology and the Pod four cover has\nsnoring detection that will\nautomatically lift your head a few\ndegrees to improve air flow and stop\nyour snoring if

the electrolytes sodium magnesium\nand potassium in the correct ratios but\nno sugar now I and others on the podcast\nhave talked a lot about the critical\nimportance of hydration for proper brain\nand bodily function research shows that\neven a slight degree of dehydration can\nreally diminish cognitive and physical\nperformance it's also important that you\nget adequate electrolytes in order for\nyour body and brain to function at their\nbest the electrolytes sodium magnesium\nand potassium are critical for the\nfunctioning of all the cells in your\nbody especially your neurons or nerve\ncells to make sure that I'm getting\nproper amounts of hydration and\nelectrolytes I dissolve one packet of\nelement in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\non hot days if I'm sweating a lot and\nlosing

an expert in the\nbiology of cannabis a topic that many\nmany people are curious about for for a\nvariety of\nreasons so just to kick things off maybe\nwe can get people up to speed on what\ncannabis\nis a little bit about how it works in\nthe brain and body to produce the\nvarious effects that it produces and how\nsome of that comes to be and then we can\ndig into some of the Nuance I have a lot\nof questions about different types if\nyou will of cannabis um the relationship\nto mental health potentially to mental\nillness we're going to drill into all of\nthat so just to kick things off what is\ncannabis\nI mean cannabis is a plant that has been\naround for some time it's kind of got\nlike a very rich history of use around\nthe world for different cultures um for\nboth kind of medicinal and spiritual and\nrecreational purposes over several\ncenturies um the plant has kind of\nbecome I mean in the west it really\nwasn't a thing mainstream wise until\nabout the 60s uh and then it became kind\nof introduced as like a drug of choice\nthat a lot of people started using\nduring the rise of the hippie and I\nthink that was a lot of the time that\ncannabis got\npopularized um and then I'd say more\nrecently cannabis has you into the '90s\nand on has become kind of a very heavily\nused drug by a large swath of people\nranging from teenagers on up uh in terms\nof what it is inside it I mean it's a\nplant with a lot of very complex\nchemistry and biology behind it so\nthere's a lot of molecules that it\ncarries in it uh we call these\ncannabinoids and they come in a lot of\ndifferent flavors but the main one\nthat's the most important one when we\ntalk about cannabis and what drives the\nkind of\nintoxicating and what I would refer to\nas psychoactive effects of cannabis is\nuh Delta 9 tetrah hydroc canaban or what\nwe call\nTHC um and that really is what dictates\nyou know the psychoactive and\nintoxicating properties of the plant and\nso the amount of THC that is within the\ncannabis plant will influence the you\nknow how high a person's going to get\nwhen they consume it uh there are\nprobably 70 to 10 and some odd other\ncannabinoids that are within cannabis\nmost of them are pretty Trace levels\nlike and they vary from different types\nto cannabis from one another uh but the\nother one that's had a lot of attention\nis cannabid or what we call CBD uh CBD\nis structurally looks pretty similar to\nTHC but doesn't behave anything like THC\nit's not intoxicating at all um I'm not\nsure I would probably say it's not\npsychoactive in the sense that people\ncan't tell if they're on it or not but I\nwould some people still say it's\npsychoactive because people claim you\nknow it can affect anxiety state or mood\nstate or other things so in that context\nmaybe psychoactive is still somewhat\nappropriate of a word to use um and then\nthere's a whole bunch of other things\nlike cannabinol canaberal and these\nother minor canabo most of which we\nreally don't understand any of the\nbiology of we don't know what they're\ndoing um they may influence some of the\neffects of THC they may not um but\nthey're there and they vary in their\ncomposition from you know different\nflavor of different cannabis to\ndifferent flavor uh and then there's\nthose other things called tpin which are\nkind of Highly volatile compounds but\nthey're not specific to cannabis they're\nfounds in tons of other plants so this\nis a lot of which seems to contribute at\nleast to some of the smell and the\nflavors of cannabis so these are things\nlike lemoning which U you know gives\nsome cannabis kind of a citrusy odor or\nflavor to it um pinene which gives\nthings more of like a earthy tree kind\nof smell uh beta caropine merine and\nthese Turpin are also some of which do\nhave gnome biologic IAL activity some\ndon't and they vary quite heavily across\ndifferent kinds of cannabis as well and\nagain there's some thought that they may\nbe influencing some of the psychoactive\nor intoxicating properties of cannabis\nbut the reality is we really don't know\na lot about them at this point there's\nkind of some emerging work that's\nstarting to come out now that kind of\nplays with you know giving someone THC\nand adding in one other tpine or one\nother minor canabo and seeing how it\ninfluences things and so you can imagine\nwith the plethora of molecules that\nexist in cannabis doing this in a\npiecewise manner could take decades to\nkind of really get to a point where we\nunderstand all the interactive um\ncomponents of cannabis but people tend\nto refer to this as like an Entourage\neffect that's kind of a phrase that gets\nused quite widely in the Cannabis world\nand the idea behind that is that if you\ntook pure THC um and so there are some\nlike distillate pens and things that\nexist out there now in the product\nMarket which are basically isolated THC\nwith Trace levels of anything of other\nstuff would be very different than if\nyou had THC in combination with some of\nthese other molecules and how they might\ninfluence how THC itself is working or\nnot\nso fascinating plant you mentioned the\npsychoactive effects um some people\nlistening to this and watching this\npresumably have experienced those\npsychoactive effects others perhaps have\nnot how could we describe for both\ngroups um what the quote unquote\npsychoactive effects are you mentioned\num the higher the concentration of THC\nthe quote unquote higher someone will\nget right the greater the intensity of\nthe High um what is the high um and I\nknow people are probably chuckling\nsaying you know does huberman not know\nbecause he's never done it I mean that's\nmy own business I I just want people to\nunderstand what you mean by psychoactive\neffects so I mean the way that people\nwould usually describe the the\nintoxicating effects of cannabis is uh\nthey would I mean people often refer to\nit as there being some Euphoria or some\npositive mood not on the same order as\nwhat people would describe with say\ncocaine or some other stimulants but\nthere certainly is some kind of positive\naspect I mean if there wasn't people\nwouldn't be using it if they didn't feel\npositive about it afterwards uh there\ncan be you know other aspects uh in\nterms of changes in feeding Behavior\npeople might find things funnier than\nthey found things it might change the\nway they perceive various environmental\nstimuli um but it can also for some\npeople create a bit of a dissociative\nstate to some some degree where people\nmight feel a little bit out of body so\nit's kind of a a complicated\nintoxicating state to describe I would\nsay because usually if someone's\nreferring to something like a stimulant\nthey're just like oh people feel like\nthey're God they're like you know\npossibility everywhere yeah exactly like\nthey're very happy and they're kind of\njacked up and I think with cannabis the\nway people would describe it would be\nvery different it's like kind of an\nintrospective State you might be more\naware of your bodily feelings and um\nstates that are going on inside you\nyou're kind of internal state but you\nalso have like a different perspective\non external stimuli you might process\ninformation a bit differently focus on\nthings a bit differently so it's kind of\na a complicated state to describe I\nwould say usually when people are\nassessing if someone's intoxicated like\num the kind of lab work where people get\nsomeone high they just kind of use a\nwhat we call a visual analog scale which\nis like a one to 100 or something or\nzero to 100 and say do you feel high do\nyou enjoy this would you say you feel\neuphoric is your mood elevated so\nthey're kind of scaling things like that\nso I think that's more typically in a\nlab setting how you would Define if\nsomeone's high or not from it and this\nis why when people do studies with\nsomething like a placebo cannabis or a\nvery low THC cannabis you'll see kind of\na scaling so um even if you give someone\na placebo cannabis if they think that\nthey're getting cannabis a lot of people\nstill respond by saying they feel a bit\nHigh that's interesting is that true\neven if they've never used cannabis\nbefore I'm not actually certain if you\nare allowed to have someone in a drug\nstudy if they've never done something\nbefore I think they have to have had\nsome previous experience with a drug be\nened now smokers everywhere running to\nlook at subject but I think yeah I don't\nthink you can use drug naive people I\nmean I don't run human clinical lab\nstudies so I can't explicitly say it but\nthat's my understanding is that someone\nhas to have had even limited like you\nknow not much but at least once or twice\nthey have to have experienced the drug\nbefore so I don't know if you would take\nsomeone who was completely blind cuz I\ndon't know how they would replicate that\nstate if they're not expecting it what\nabout the effects of cannabis on time\nperception you know there's this um\nreputation that cannabis has uh for\ndisrupting time perception that people\nwill think a long period of time has\npassed when in fact very little time has\npassed maybe it's sometimes even the\nreverse\num is the mechanism by which cannabis\ncan adjust time perception known I\nwouldn't say it's well worked out there\ndefinitely seems to be some like\ntemporal d like you're saying where\npeople think things have you know\nsomeone will be high and someone will\nask them how long do you think time has\npassed they would report usually longer\nperiods of time have passed than I\nactually\nhave I feel like there is some older\nwork I could dig up to see if I could\nfind that is either in like it might\neven be in pigeons uh but it might be in\nrodents that's looking at like temporal\nordering and they give animals\ncannaboids and that's kind of a cleaner\nway of seeing because they are very good\nat learning like if I wait 10 minutes\nand then I engage in a behavior I get a\nreward and so you you can really train\nanimals to have this ordinal timing\nwhere they kind of know distinct periods\nof time and if they give them canabo\nthey respond differently so it in that\ncontext it does still seem to produce\nsome state where there's a an altered\nperception of time passing and so I\nthink if we were going to really\nunderstand the mechanism of it that\nwould probably be the way to go but I'm\nnot super familiar with the work because\nno one's I mean anything I can think of\nis pretty old I can't think of anything\nmodern where people have actually looked\nat this interesting uh you mentioned\neffects of cannabis on appetite and I\nknow one of the um medical uses of\ncannabis is in people that are\nundergoing treatment for cancer in order\nto stimulate appetite because oftentimes\nthey have very low or even no appetite\ndue to the cancer treatment um is the\nmechanism by which cannabis can\nstimulate appetite known and if so um\nwhat is the general trend of of effect\nmakes people hungrier obviously but we\nhear again in um kind of uh recreational\nter terms of people getting the munchies\nyou know becoming exceedingly hungry is\nthat related to some cannabis induced\neffect on say blood sugar like insulin\nor glucose regulation or is it happening\nat at a different level yeah I think we\nalmost need to take a step back actually\nto talk about how cannabis works in the\nBrain before we kind of go into that so\nTHC as a molecule exerts almost all its\neffects they're acting at this one\nreceptor for the most part that's widely\nexpressed through the brain called the\ncannabinoid type 1 receptor um CB1 yeah\nCB1 is the shorthand for it and and I\nthink um you know as people tend to\ncreate analogies to describe what\nreceptors are for those you who don't\nknow it's most people use like a lock\nand key analogy that like a receptor\nwould be a protein that sits on a cell\nand a molecule that binds to it like THC\nis the key that fits in that lock when\nit activates it it triggers some\nbiological process in the cell in this\ncase a neuron that changes its activity\nin some capacity um and so THC acts on\nthese CB1 receptors which um are very\nwidely expressed in fact outside of like\nkind of ION channel that are expressed\nin the brain the CB1 is I think one of\nthe most if not the most widely\nexpressed receptor in the brain it's\neverywhere so it's really important um\nand I think as as kind of you had\nalluded to previously uh it didn't it\ndoesn't exist in the you know this\ndidn't evolve in humans in the hopes\nthat one day humans would find Cannabis\nthis is just although cannabis users\neverywhere use that argument um I know\npeople love to leverage U things if it's\na plant it's you know it's natural and\nsafe and there's obviously issues we'll\ntalk about with that um but but I mean\nreally this is just biological\nredundancy I mean you know nature only\nhas so many ways to create something and\nso there's going to be things that end\nup overlapping in the way that they\nfunction and so the receptor that's in\nthe brain and throughout the body the\nCB1 and there is also a CB2 receptor\nit's not really expressed in the brain\nit's in some of the immune cells in the\nbrain and maybe maybe some limited\ndistribution in um actual brain cell\nneurons where where in the body is it\nit's mostly immune cells so you'll see\nCB2 is mostly on like macroasia or other\nkind of immune cells cells that gobble\nup debris yeah and that basically you\nknow regulate inflammatory processes and\nso the main role of CB2 seems to be much\nmore about like regulating inflammation\num so that's kind of a separate role\nthat can certainly impact the brain in\ndifferent ways but uh when we talk about\nthe effects on the central nervous\nsystem and the brain and behavior we're\ntalking almost entirely about CB1 and so\nboth the CB1 and CB2 receptors like I\nsaid don't exist because nature was like\nhumans are going to find Cannabis\nthey'll this will all work together now\nso there are molecules our body\nproducers which we call endoc\ncanabo um and they are kind of funny\nlittle molecules because they don't\nreally behave like certainly in the\nbrain they don't behave like a normal\nneurotransmitter so I mean I assume most\npeople who listen to your podcast are\nrelatively Adept with the basic idea of\nhow neurons work so you have Neuron a\nlet's call it the Press synaptic neuron\nbecause you have that gap between the\ntwo cells where they communicate called\nthe synapse so Neuron a releases a\ntransmitter and it can be something that\nexcites the neighboring cell neuron b or\nit can inhibit it um and so the way that\nwe always kind of talk about\nneurotransmission in the brain is Neuron\na releases a chemical that crosses the\nsynapse acts on neuron B and it can\neither you know Jack that neuron's\nactivity up or it can scale it down and\nthat affects you know brainwide patterns\nof activity uh and we call that\nanterograde because it moves from neuron\na to neuron B which is kind of the\ngeneral flow of things um and how we\nusually think about it so endoc canabo\nare kind of this you know little bit of\nan oddity in the sense that they could\ndo the reverse and so endoc canab are\nactually made in neuron B on the post\nsynaptic side and then they go backwards\nand act on Neuron a to regulate how much\ntransmitter is released and so in many\nways this is like I kind of liken it to\na thermostat model for the most part\ncertainly if we're talking about\nsomething like excitability so if Neuron\na is dumping out something that excites\nneuron B like glutamate which is an\nexcitatory neurotransmitter as neuron b\ngets too excited it's going to start\nreleasing endoc canabo to go back and\nNeuron a to stop driving it so so sort\nof a homeostatic scale and trying to\nmaintain a middle range yeah I mean at\nthe end of the day no matter how you\ndiscuss it and what system you discuss\nit I think the majority of people in the\ncanabo field would agree that the\nprimary physiological role of endoc\ncanabo is to maintain homeostasis that's\nwhat they do they keep everything in its\nhappy place let's say so like and that's\nprobably why the CB1 receptor is so\nwidely distributed is that neurons can\nexcite or inhibit each other um that is\nraise or reduce the amount of electrical\nactivity in the let's say nearby neuron\ncuz you talking about retrograde\nsignaling but um ultimately you don't\nwant runaway excitation that looks like\nepilepsy exactly and you don't want\nrunaway inhibition because that looks\nlike um suppression of ability to think\nmove Etc exactly so you want to keep\nthings in the in where they should be\nand so you want neurons to get excited\nbut you want them you don't want them to\nget ere excited so endoc canabo in kind\nof a very prototypical sense act as this\ncircuit breaker essentially where they\ngo back and gate how much is coming in\nand they do this by through various\nmechanisms essentially turning off the\nelectrical activity of that prestic\nneurons so that it stops releasing\nneurotransmitter um they can also\nregulate though inhibitory\nneurotransmitter release as well and\nthis is usually done through a little\nbit more of a complex process where it's\ndriven by excitation but then it\nregulates the inhibitory pathway so\ninhibiting the inhibitor leads to more\nexcitation exactly I usually liken it to\nbasically taking the brakes off of a car\nwhile you're going down kind of thing\nlike you're you know you use your\nbraking system to keep things in check\nbut if you want to go faster you take\nthe foot off the brakes and you let\nthings accelerate and so this can be\nreally important for things like forms\nof synaptic plasticity or or\nneuroplasticity let's say where you want\nsynaptic strengthening to happen so like\nunder a learning event or something you\nwant that synapse to really hardwire\nbetter and so having endoc canabo kind\nof turn off the inhibitory component is\none of the mechanisms to facilitate that\nbut at the same time if you want to\nhave a bit more adaptive flexibility\nendoc canabo can weaken that synapse at\nthe same time by acting right at the\nexcitatory terminal itself and so their\nability to kind of play with the\nrelative activity of a circuit is really\ndependent on which neuron they're acting\non and so they can regulate excitation\nor inhibition differentially and I mean\nCB1 receptors are found on virtually\nevery single kind of neuron in the brain\num except one and I think you'll find\nthis interesting because it's dopamine\nuh and and doine neurons are basically\nthe only neurons in the brain that don't\nreally at least as far as we've been\nable to characterize to date Express\ncannaboid receptors interesting uh if I\nmay um earlier you mentioned one of the\npotential psychoactive effects of uh\nCanabis is Euphoria does that mean that\nthe Euphoria associated with cannabis\nuse is independent of dopamine and is\nmore reliant on something like perhaps\nthe opioid receptor system or the\nserotonergic receptor system yeah I\nwouldn't say that cannaboids don't\naffect dopamine because um what we\nunderstand in the ventral tegmental area\nwhich is kind of the hot spot of\ndopamine neurons or at least the ones\nthat are involved in motivation and\nstuff um those neurons are are regulated\nby a lot of inhibitory neurons that dump\nout inhibitory transmitter and keep\nthose neurons kind of quiet or so\nthere's an opportunity for indirect reg\nexctly so what you have is those neurons\nthat regulate the dopamine neurons are\nvery rich in cannaboid receptors this is\nactually kind of similar to how mu\nopioid receptors work for things like\nmorphine or heroin um and essentially\nwhat the cannaboid receptors will do is\nwhen they're activated they'll turn off\nthat inhibitory control and that allows\ndopamine neurons to kind of uh move into\na state where they're more prone to go\ninto burst firing and have big dumps of\ndopamine whether or not that relates to\nyou know the positive a effect or the\nEuphoria I don't think anyone has\ncleanly demonstrated that I mean\nobviously dop me's very complicated in\nterms of its relation to end points and\nwhether it's reward or motivation um but\ncannaboids definitely do have an\ninfluence on dopamine transmission they\njust don't tend to do it directly and I\nthink that's this very bizarre and\ninteresting component of canabo\nsignaling is why the brain would have\nevolved in a way to allow every other\nneurotransmitter system to be actively\nand directly regulated by endoc canabo\nbut dop meaner is kind of spared from\nthis so I don't know no one I mean\nobviously you can always just\ntheoretically guess as to why someone do\nthat I don't know what the reason for it\nwould be but it is something that has\nkind of uh intrigued a lot of people\nbecause every other system in the brain\nis so tightly controlled to some degree\nby cannaboids and then this one circuit\nis kind of free of it so um but yeah so\nthe main role of endoc canabo is really\nto to regulate plasticity of homeostasis\nallow flexibility of circuits to either\nGoose up their activity or or ramp it\ndown if they need to depending on the\nenvironment depending on the experience\nof the organism so there's a lot of kind\nof roles that endoc canabo play in that\ndomain but even within the endoc canabo\num I mean there's there's two primary\nendoc canabo and again this is one of\nthe weird things about how endoc canabo\nwork because if you talk about things\nlike serotonin or dopamine you have a\nsingle molecule that gets released in\nthe typical anterograde way and it\ndiversifies at the level of the receptor\nso serotonin has like I don't know like\n15 receptors or 20 or something no uh\ndopamine has at least five uh and so the\ndifferent actions that serotonin or\ndopamine will have is all driven by the\ndiversification of The receptors it's\none molecule whereas cannabinoids are\nthe reverse not only do they work\nbackwards across the synapse and work in\nthis retrograde fashion but really you\nhave one receptor that is regulated by\ntwo molecules so the diversification\nhappens more at the level of the\nmolecule than at the receptor which is\nagain very unique and the two molecules\nthat we know are kind of the Bonafide\nendocannabinoids there could be more um\nthey're called anandamide which um is\nactually kind of a funny name because it\ncomes from the Sanskrit word Anand for\nBliss and so Rafi mulam who was in\nIsrael when he discovered the molecule\nyou know 30 odd years ago um wanted it\nto reflect inner Bliss and so he named\nit anandamide so it's like inner Bliss\nwith an amide bond is kind of the joke\nhe had for it and so he discovered um an\nemide and decided to call it Bliss\nbecause he had familiarity with cannabis\nor because he he took an emide as a as a\ndirect experience and because it takes a\nlot for a scientist to discover a\nmolecule but then for a scientist to\ndiscover a molecule and then name it\nBliss for a particular reason you have\nto speculate that they they had some\nfamiliarity with with the m was also the\nguy who who isolated and discovered THC\nso I mean he has a very he's kind of the\ngrandfather of whole cannaboid field so\nhe has a landmark paper from 1964 which\nironically um and this is one of these\nweird pop culture things I don't know if\nthis is true that paper was published on\nApril 20th 1964 and so the joke is is\nthis where 420 came from because the\noriginal like birth date of the first\nTHC paper was 420 1964 well now that\nthat now that um potential myth is\ndefinitely going to propagate um but\nyeah so he he he'd been in the field for\na while and so he had studied cannabis\non that side and then in 1990 his lab\nisolated an andite has being the first\nmolecule that activated the receptor\nendogenously and so um it was kind of uh\nyeah I think it was a little tongue and\ncheek that he named it the way he did a\nfew years later the second molecule\nwhich is just called tonal glycerol or\nwhat we call 2ag that was discovered\nkind of in tandom both Again by Mulan\nbut also by a Japanese group um and so\nwe understand these two molec don't do\nthe same thing like they are a bit\ndifferent so the way anandamide binds\nthe receptor is it's what we would call\na high Affinity but low efficacy um\nAgonist or molecule at least and what I\nmean by that is very low levels of\nanandamide are required to actually bind\nto the receptor but once it binds its\nability to stimulate a biological\nresponse in that neuron is kind of caps\nout pretty fast so it doesn't have like\na sledgehammer effect whereas 2 a seems\nto require a bit more more concentration\nin the synapse to be able to bind to the\nreceptor so it has a lower affinity for\nthe receptor but once it binds to the\nreceptor it's like pretty heavy duty so\nit evokes a very robust um intracellular\nsignaling response and\nso why we have two endoc canabo we're\nnot totally sure some of us have\ntheories I'm of the camp that I think\nthey may play somewhat differential\nroles either based on the synapse or the\ncircuit that they're working in or this\nidea that maybe anandamide might be more\nof a tonic molecule and what I mean by\nthat is we'll say it's like a stage\nSetter so like an emide might just be\nkind of made by neurons on an ongoing\nbasis and just released and its job may\nbe to kind of keep the steady state of a\nbrain circuit in a desired range so that\nunder resting conditions it's not too\nactive or too quiet your thermostat\nanalogy is perfectly so in that context\nit kind of is like just the thermostat\nof the house whereas 2ag is like let's\nsay the pinch hitter who gets brought in\nto do the heavy lifting and so 2 AG\nduring a situation like let's say\nsomething like even like a seizure as an\nextreme example where you have a huge\namount of neural activity those neurons\nthat are getting heavily activated\nduring you know massive amounts of\nneural activity start dumping out huge\namounts of 2ag and that acts as the okay\nwe really need to turn off this circuit\nvery quickly in this situation and in\nmost of these forms of like synaptic\nplasticity like I was saying earlier\nwhere you need to either strengthen or\nweaken a synapse in response to a change\nin the environment or in response to an\nexperience or something that's going on\nmost of that is driven by 2ag signaling\nand so um you know all these forms of\nlike turning things up or down in an in\na kind of rapid and ond demand manner\nthat's mostly 2 AG so most people who\nstudy like neurophysiology and like\nrecord activity in neurons and look at\nendoc canabo they're almost entirely\ntalking about 2ag when they play with\nstuff um so yeah that's kind of one of\nthe ways we do it we say that anandamide\nmay be more tonic and 2ag might be more\nphasic and like brought online when\nneeded but doesn't do a lot there is\nsome evidence that 2ag may also have a\nrole to regulate some circuits under\nkind of resting conditions as well and\nthere certainly are some situations\nwhere anandamide might get brought into\nplay um to affect plasticity but as kind\nof like an umbrella idea of how we look\nat it that's often how we divide those\ntwo up so we kind of have these two\nmolecules the end of the day do the same\nthing they're regulating\nneurotransmitter release um through\nretrograde signal but what stimulation\nbrings them online or what drives their\nactivity May differentiate and we don't\nreally understand all the details behind\nthat outside of the fact that we very\nclearly know 2ag is activity dependent\nso as that neuron becomes more active\nit's going to make 2ag to regulate its\ninputs um so yeah you have this very\ncomplex system and it's really widely\ndistributed in you know it's everywhere\ncannaboid receptors and the endoc\ncannaboid molecules are in the cortex\nthey're in the hypothalamus they're in\nthe strum the hippocampus the cerebellum\nall over the except the one area where\nit's really interesting actually um\nwhere you don't really see much receptor\nis in brain stem populations that\nregulate um you know kind of unconscious\ncardiac and respiratory function so this\nis one of the things that really\ndifferentiates cannabis from opiates\nbecause a lot of the signaling\nmechanisms between opioid receptors and\ncannaboid receptors are quite similar\nbut um as it's been well established\npeople can overdose and fatally and die\nfrom opiates relatively easily and the\nway that that tends to happen is uh when\nyou activate the op receptors in the\nkind of cardiorespiratory parts of the\nbrain stem it depresses neural activity\nso as the person loses Consciousness um\nthey also unconsciously will stop\nregulating their own heart and breathing\nand they can it can be a fatal response\nbecause cannabinoid receptors don't\nreally exist in those regions you don't\nget the same kind of impact in terms of\nsuppressing heart rate um and breathing\nfunction and so that's I mean you know\nthere's always the saying like there's\nnever been an account of someone\nactually dying from a cannabis overdose\nor a THC overdose I mean certainly\npeople can do stupid things while\nthey're intoxicated that result in their\ndeath but in the same manner that\nsomeone can die from consuming too much\nopiates that doesn't seem to be\nphysically possible with cannaboids as\nfar as we've seen so far um and a lot of\nthat is just because of the localization\nlike for some reason it's just not the\nreceptors in that part of the brain so\nvery interesting um a lot of uh kind of\nafficianado questions about the receptor\nbiology I'll just um spare everyone the\ndetails by just um highlighting\nsomething that you already said far more\neloquently than I will which is I think\nit is fascinating that this whole system\nhas both a tonic like a steady release\ncapability and uh a phasic you know so\nthe ability to spike forgive the p p the\nneuroscientists will know what I'm\ntalking about to spike more activity of\nthis system superimposed on that tonic\nactivity because this is something that\nyou see in the dopamine system this is\nsomething that you see in essentially\nevery neuromodulator neurotransmitter\nsystem um but it seems that the\nendocannabinoid system has accomplished\nthis quite a bit differently so very\ninteresting um uh unique system in in a\nnumber of ways that raise a number of uh\nkey questions so yeah if you go back to\nthe munchies question you had um so if\nwe tie into that one of the so there's a\nfew ways I mean cannabinoids and feeding\nare a really interesting thing because\nProto like if you ask people like kind\nof the prototypical responses to\nconsuming cannabis most people would\nusually say Munchies is one of the\nthings that pops up pretty regularly and\nso you know the cannabinoid receptors\nare very um they are expressed in these\nfeeding circuits in the hypothalamus um\nand you know there's a lot of complex\ncircuitry there that can regulate food\nseeking behavior and yeah we just had an\nepisode with Zack knight from hhmi and\nUCSF where he talked about like the agrp\nneurons different neurons of the\nhypothalamus we can link to that in the\nshow note captions um uh nowadays a rich\nunderstanding of the neurons that\nstimulate food seeking craving and and\nand so we know that like cannaboids they\nregulate again those inhibitory inputs\naround agrp neurons for example and so\none thing they can do is disinhibit\nthose agrp neurons so they become more\nactive and that can drive food-seeking\nBehavior so that's certainly one\nmechanism of it but there's also a huge\nreward component to this um in terms of\nthe munchies and so we know that like\nyou can also just dump an anide for\nexample this is you know Steve mer and\nKent be did this work years ago where\nthey just put an anide into the nucleus\nof incumbents and that can also\nstimulate palatable food intake so you\nalso have this ability to integrate with\nthe reward circuitry um and then there\nwas also this fascinating paper from a\nJapanese group in PN I think about 12\nyears ago and what they found was they\nwould um give a rodent a canabo and then\nthey would stimulate different taste bud\npopulations and then they would look at\nthe gustatory cortical response to\nstimulating the populations and what\nthey found is under the influence of a\ncannabinoid if you stimulated sweet\ntaste buds you got an enhanced response\nin the gustatory cortex but not if you\ndid salty bitter or sour or I don't know\nif they did do mommy in that one but it\nwas very explicit to sweet tasting and\nso you have this kind of ability to like\njack up the way the brain is processing\nsweet tasting Foods you have this\nengagement of the reward circuitry and\nthen you also have this ability to\nregulate agrp neurons as well as the\nPalm C neurons there's kind of both\nsides to that in the in the aru nucleus\num to regulate multiple components of\nfeeding but a big question is like my\nlab has become kind of interested in\nthis as well because we have a a\ncomponent of my lab that studies feeding\nbehavior and one of my posts has been\ndoing these projects for years now\ntrying to understand almost like at a\nbehavioral mechanism level what the\nmunchies are and what she's been looking\nat is we kind of started thinking about\nthe idea that you know what is it that\nbecause it's not just food seeking and\nit's not just you know like just want to\nconsume something there's there's a\nmaintenance of eating and so we know\nfrom humans and animals you can satiate\nthem you can make someone full and then\nget them high on cannabis and they'll\nreinitiate eating so that's an\ninteresting thing in of itself because\nthat means you're disrupting either the\nability of the brain to detect satiety\nor you're messing with a process we call\nreward devaluation and so reward\nevaluation is like you know if you\nhaven't eaten for a day and you see like\na picture of a pizza someone brings a\npizza in front of you it just looks\ndelicious that First Slice tastes\namazing it's salty it's fatty it's\ndelicious you eat five of those slices\nit feels greasy and nasty and so that\nprocess of how you perceive the food and\nits reward salience degrades as you eat\nand as your brain basically shifts into\na thing of we don't need to consume\ncalories and food anymore we're okay\nwe're full now um and so we've done a\nseries of experiments in the lab where\nYou' get the animals and either satiated\nin advance where they have already\ndevalued the food and under a normal\nState they won't eat it anymore they\nwon't work to get access to it um and\nyou get them high on like a cannabis\nextract we have these Vape chambers that\nare like um I don't know how else to\ndescribe it outside of like a little hot\nbox it's probably the best way to this\nCU it's essentially a kind of a a locked\nairtight box that the rack goes in and\nit gets like Vapor Puffs and it fills up\nand then they inhale this and then it\nclears out and they get another puff and\nthen it fills up and we do this for like\n15 minutes and we've tit traded all this\nto get exactly blood levels of THC that\nyou would achieve in someone who's you\nknow consuming cannabis through smoking\num and so we get them to that point and\nthen give them access to food and they\nwill yeah go Gang Busters they eat food\ndoesn't matter what you give them you\ngive them plain Chow they go to town you\ngive them fatty you give them sweet they\nlove it all but you pre satiate them and\nthey get them stoned they will\nreinitiate eating again and you make\nthem work for it where they have to like\nlever press um and you get them stoned\nand they will go to town on that and\nthey will work and proof that even under\nthe influence of cannabis um animals\nwill work hard yeah they for food I\ndon't know about other stuff but for\nfood they certainly will I mean and at\nleast weird it's in C Mo have done this\nat Hopkins as well they've shown\nsimilarly using what we call Progressive\nratio which is a essentially a thing\nwhere it's like the first time you press\na you immediately get a sugar next time\nyou got to hit it twice to get a pellet\nthen you have to hit it four times to\nget one yeah then you got to hit it 16\nand then and it kind of scales\nexponentially up um I mean we've had\nthis one female we kind of joke about in\nthe lab this one female rat and you get\nher high and she'll do like 300 lever\npresses to get one sugar Pelt like she\nreally wants it um so you can really\nkind of goose up their motivation to eat\nand so there's clearly a rewarding\naspect of this because they're motivated\nto engage enough in working to get\naccess to the food but you can also um\ndo another way of testing this question\nwhich is you comp paare a food with um\nsomething that will make the animal feel\nnauseous like lithium chloride this is\nkind of the way that you would test uh\ncondition taste diversion so you give\nthem access to a food and then you give\nthem something that makes them feel\nnauseous and the animals will avoid that\nfood and so um that's another way to\nkind of devalue a food is by pairing it\nwith a nauseant so the animal no longer\nlikes it so again same situation you can\nget the animal stoned and it will\nre-engage in eating that food that it\nhad devalued through being paired with a\nnause and so through either satiety or\nmaking it um kind of a a negative\nAssociated flavor because the animal got\nnauseous before you can kind of override\nthese Effects by giving THC and so that\ncould be a complex process that either\ninvolves changes in the reward circuitry\nthis could be something that's like from\nthe orbital frontal cortex which is a\nvery important part of the brain that\nscales reward and kind of assesses how\nmuch someone wants to work or an\norganism wants to work to achieve a\nreward at the end so we haven't figured\nout the circuitry of this and where\nexactly it's acting but I would say a\nlot of the stuff that you know we and\nothers have done kind of supports this\nidea that a lot of what the munchies is\nis this ability to kind of almost lock\nin the reward value of food so that it\ndoesn't Decay despite satiety despite\neating over time it just keeps it highly\nSalient so that they want to work for it\nstill um and then similarly we've also\nwe and others have also done work to\nshow it can block satiety signals so we\nknow endoc canabo at least um are\ncapable of overriding leptin so leptin\nis an anorectic molecule comes out from\nthe fat and usually we release it when\nwe've eaten a lot and it's one of these\nthings that tells our brain stop eating\nyou know it works through again uh\npopulations in the arcu nucleus and\nchanges the way those neurons function\nto drive food seeking\nbehavior um and we and others have shown\npreviously that that you know if you\nelevate endoc canabo you can override\nthat and actually one of the mechanisms\nby which leptin seems to suppress\nfeeding is actually by turning on the\nthe metabolism of endoc canabo so that\ntheir levels Decline and so as you lose\nthat endoc canabo function the animal is\nless interested in eating and so you can\nprevent these anorectic effects of\nleptin by like goosing up endoc canabo\nactivity as many of you know I've been\ntaking ag1 for more than 10 years now so\nI'm delighted that they're sponsoring\nthis podcast to be clear I don't take\nag1 because they're a sponsor rather\nthey are a sponsor because I take ag1 in\nfact I take ag1 once and often twice\nevery single day and I've done that\nsince starting way back in 2012 there is\nso much conflicting information out\nthere nowadays about what proper\nnutrition is but here's what there seems\nto be a general consensus on whether\nyou're an omnivore a carnivore a\nvegetarian or a vegan I think it's\ngenerally agreed that you should get\nmost of your food from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources which allows\nyou to eat enough but not overeat get\nplenty of vitamins and minerals\nprobiotics and micronutrients that we\nall need for physical and mental health\nnow I personally am an omnivore and I\nstrive to get most of my food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources but the reason I still take ag1\nonce and often twice every day is that\nit ensures I get all of those vitamins\nminerals probiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nreport feeling much better in a number\nof important ways such as energy levels\ndigestion sleep and more so while many\nsupplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink ag1 / huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman you you're talking about\nincreasing endoc canabo activity um and\nwe've said all this in the context of\ncannabis so maybe we could talk a little\nbit about how the components in cannabis\nTHC mainly but also CBD um impact these\nreceptors the CB1 and let's just leave\nCB2 out for the moment because it sounds\nlike it's more of an immune system thing\num but just to make it very clear um is\nthere a way to increase the activity of\nendoc\ncanabo with without ingesting THC yes I\nmean they dynamically change all the\ntime so but you're I'm talking about um\nyou're talking about experimentally or\nrecreationally adjusting their levels\nbut how does one do that um without\nusing THC so okay few things there we'll\ntake a step back so THC itself isn't\ngoing to um it does its thing by acting\ndirectly on the cannaboid receptor not\nso it sort of mimics the anandamide and\nand 2 AG yeah so THC going back to kind\nof the pharmacology of this so THC if\nyou look at how it interacts with the\nreceptor um it's not it's not a heavy\nduty molecule so I mean this was kind of\none of the things that came up before as\nwell is this idea that th use a\nsledgehammer and it overrides endoc\ncanabo by the way um Matt's referring to\nthe fact that I said that in a previous\nsolo episode about this um and there I\nwas nesting it in the concentrations of\nTHC that can be found in high THC\ncannabis yeah um so essentially what I\nwas saying is that at very high THC\nconcentrations the amount maybe not The\nBinding Affinity but the amount of THC\nthat is available to the CB1 receptors\nis going to exceed what's normally found\nin terms of the amount of anandamide\nthat can bind to CB1 receptors because\nwhat you're talking about is a\nsuperphysiological condition it's I mean\nyou don't really actually need much THC\nin the brain to produce psychoactivity\nlike it's it's a little bit of a mystery\nto be honest exactly how it works I mean\nI think the main way that most people in\nthe cannaboid theory field would look at\nthis is that THC is not like a very\nstrong Agonist I mean even if you look\nat its ability to trigger an\nintracellular response it's much lower\nthan 2 AG it's actually more like an\nanide so you said an anide is high\nAffinity low efficacy so THC is the same\nTHD is actually only a partial Agonist\nit's not even a full Agonist at CB1 but\nit is high Affinity it's high Affinity\nso it has the ability so but the tricky\nthing with that\nis it can out compete 2 a but because\nit's a lower efficacy Agonist than 2 AG\nin that sense it's almost blocking the\neffects not um amplifying them blocking\nthe effects of 2ag but does it block the\neffects of anandamide um it you know to\nTHD and anandamide I would kind of the\nway I would visualize it is because they\nseem to have relatively similar\naffinities and efficacies of the\nreceptor they might let's say dance\naround so it would be somewhat\ninterchangeable the difference there is\nand this I think is the big point about\nwhat THC does versus endoc canabo\nbecause we know now through the\npharmaceutical development of drugs that\ncan boost anandamide levels which exist\nwe have Inhibitors that prevent their\nmetabolism we can Elevate them there's\nno intoxication and no psychoactivity\nassociated with elevating anandamide\nthat's a very interesting point that we\nshould highlight so there are drugs that\nnow exist that can block the breakdown\nof anandamide make more available\npresumably by disrupting some enzymatic\nbreakdown exactly and therefore lead to\nmore binding of the now elevated levels\nof an anandamide that are available to\nCB1 and you see no psychoactive effect\nno psychoactive people are not aware\nthat they yeah you can do no one can\nguess yeah no one can guess what is it\nused for um well I mean it was developed\nthe first molecule really was developed\nby fizer to look at if it could work on\npain um the first trial that was done\ndid not work it was like um kind of\nstrange osteoarthritic knee pain trial\nthat was like even in that trial the\npositive control of nioxin barely worked\nbut because the fa inhibitor which is uh\ntake a step back FS the enzyme that\nchews up anandamide so the drug that is\ndeveloped inhibits that enzyme so you\nprevent the enzymatic breakdown of\nanandamide so we just call them fa\nInhibitors um so this drug will boost\nanandamide levels quite high and in\nanimal research showed some efficacy in\nmodulating pain and so they put it a\ntrial and it didn't work against the\npositive control of NE proxin which is\nlike an ends say just like Advil\nbasically a leave yeah essentially yeah\nso um and that drug didn't work that\ngreat to begin with so it was maybe some\nissues with the trial but it essentially\nkilled the development of the drug from\nthat point on because everyone's like oh\nit's not going to work so it kind of\nsheld for a while um a colleague of mine\nMarcus hilig and leam Mayo uh Leah's now\na colleague of mine in Calgary but at\nthe time she was a postto with Marcus in\nSweden and they were able to get access\nto this molecule right before Co\nessentially um and they did a a trial in\njust healthy controls with it which\nagain this is kind of jumping the gun\nand so of other stuff I'll talk about so\nI'll tether back to that but what we did\nwhat they did was they dosed people for\n10 days on this drug and then we looked\nat stress and fear because this is\nsomething that I study this is something\nthat they were interested in um and we\ndid find that boosting anandamide with\nthis drug over 10 days uh was\nsufficiently cap capable of dampening\nstressinduced autonomic responses so\nlike looking at heart rate or skin\nconductance I think skin conductance was\nthe measure we did there but it's a\nproxy for like adrenaline release um so\nit blunted that and it blunted\nsubjective feelings of stress as well so\npeople had lower levels of saying they\nactually felt stressed um and it kind of\nhelped remove this like conditioned fear\nmemory that we had they had trained\npeople to do and so I worked with them\non kind of doing the biochemistry of\nthis to make sure the drug was working\nproperly um but it was very interesting\nbecause we did see in that situation\nwhere elevating anandamide produced kind\nof like a reduction in stress perception\na reduction in stress physiology\nresponses and kind of um help kind of\nreduce fear and so that is kind of an\ninteresting outcome because it it tracks\nwith some of the stuff we know about\ncannabis and I'm sure we'll talk about\nsome of the PTSD stuff and anxiety later\nbut um so that's kind of one of the\nthings the drug has not really been used\nthat widely yet it's still it's one of\nthe frustrations I have is um a\nscientist who does a lot of\ntranslational work and with clinical\nPartners like Leah uh is that getting\naccess to these molecules is not easy\nwhen they're not kind of wide they're\nnot like out in the market so you can\njust go and get them you really have to\ntry and get access from the drug\ncompanies to be able to do trials with\nthem and so we are in the mid them\ntrying to do that um we did just\ncomplete a trial that LE and Marcus ran\nthat I worked with them on as well that\nwas on\nPTSD um and so there are various\npotential indications for this I mean\nJohnson and Johnson developed one as\nwell and they looked at it in social\nanxiety disorder they had some moderate\nefficacy in their trial so I'd say the\njury's still out on exactly what we're\ngoing to do with these but um they have\nsome potential I think in certain\nclinical settings we just have to figure\nthat out exactly but I think going back\nto where we started this from they're\nnot psychoactive and so I mean when\nfizer first made the drug they were\nactually initially concerned that it\nwasn't getting in the brain because no\none could tell they were on the drug I\nmean this was the Wild West at this\npoint no one had any idea what end\ncannaboids were actually going to do\npeople were basing it on what we knew\nabout THC so the Assumption was people\nwould have psychoactivity but they\ndidn't um fizer then actually had to do\nthey did a sleep study to show that it\ndid have some effects on sleep cycle um\nthe same way THC does and then they also\ndid like a an invivo pet binding study\nto show that they could displace um a\nradioactive molecule that would bind to\nthe enzyme in the brain seems like a lot\nof gymnastics to basically confirm what\nthey already knew which is that even\ngreatly elevating the Anand by blocking\nthis entic breakdown of an endide leads\nto at least from what I'm understanding\nvastly different subjective experience\nthan ingesting or smoking THC which\nbrings us back to THC so what's it doing\nand cannabis like you know um so I think\nit seems that this this thing that we\ncall cannabis and THC are overlapping\nwith the endogenous effects of\nanandamide but here you're not talking\nabout endogenous normal levels you're\ntalking about pH logically greatly\nincreasing anandamide no psychoactive\neffect no Euphoria no Munchies you know\nEtc then people smoke or take an edible\nof THC or cannabis and you get a vastly\ndifferent set of effects so maybe we\ncould talk about uh THC and the CB1\nreceptor and since we're here we might\nas well um talk about CBD and and the I\nthink you're going to tell us the lack\nof interaction with CB1 receptor right\num and what is cannabis doing at the\nlevel of these receptors because um it\nmakes me wonder whether or not these\nreceptors are the whole story or whether\nor not cannabis is you know as you\nmentioned you know 70 plus uh active\nmolecules in there tpin and a bunch of\nother things that may modify their\naction that this thing we call cannabis\nhas many more actions than just\nmimicking the endogenous cannaboid\nsystem yeah I mean I think I would say\nthe main way that we think about this is\nthe difference between endoc canabo and\nTHC is endoc can abono are going to be\nreleased in a very specific spatial and\ntemporal manner so they evolve to do\nthat yeah so there's going to be and I\nthink like it's very clear that like\nanandamide for example is not active at\nevery synapse that has CB1 and so when\nwe boost anandamide signaling by\ninhibiting its metabolism all we're\ndoing is amplifying anandamide signaling\nat the synapses it already exists\nwhereas THC when you consume it orally\nor inhalation wise and it gets into your\nblood and into your brain um it's just\nblanket activation you're just carpet\nbombing the whole system\nindiscriminately and so you're\nintroducing the Lian the thing that\nbinds the receptor this is Far and Away\ndifferent than say like the actions of\namphetamines which are disrupting the\nnormal biology in a way that's giving\nyou an amplification of an endogenous\nmechanism yes right um if that was all\njust nerd speak for those listening it's\none in the context of amphetamines what\nyou're doing is you're taking an\nendogenous system a naturally occurring\nsystem and you're greatly amplifying the\namount of dopamine the amount of\nnorepinephrine that's\navailable with what we're discussing\ntoday the endoc canabo system seems to\nbe producing a set of effects that might\noverlap with the THC effects but THC is\ndoing a bunch of other things it's and\nthat's because THC and we'll talk about\nCBD but at least THC is acting as the\nLian it's in some sense we don't want to\nsay replacing but it's masking the\neffects of an andmine I think the\nproblem is when you just blanket\nactivate all the CB1 receptors in the\nbrain indiscriminately like you do when\nyou consume cannabis with THC the\nresulting effect is the intoxicating\nState and it's probably because there's\na lot of CB1 receptors in the cortex and\nthose are going to be differentially\nregulated at different times by endoc\ncanabo whereas when THC hits them all of\nthem are going to get affected at once\nand if you think of the way that I had\ndescribed how cannaboid receptors work\nby essentially I mean in its simplest\nform what cannaboid receptors do is they\nchange the way that two neurons talk to\neach other um and so so you're changing\nall the networks simultaneously yeah so\nif you hit a whole bunch of networks\nsimultaneously you're just going to\nchange the way that information\nprocessing and perception occurs and I\nthink as a consequence of that that's\nwhat produces the intoxicating State not\nthat THC is like a you know a super\nduper version of an endoc canabo or that\nit's boosting endoc\ncanabidol as opposed to a system that's\nvery finely tuned to do very specific\nthings at very specific times that's\nvery helpful so the analogy that I was\nconsidering using coming in here like\nthe difference between endogenous\ntestosterone or estrogen versus\npharmacologic uh testosterone or\nestrogen given as a therapy doesn't app\nis very different because that's that's\nan that's a levels issue this is a\nlevels and an extent issue yeah this is\na lot more to do with just yeah the\nnature of how it hits everything because\nlike so for example if we talk about\nfeeding we know uh it's been established\nat this point that for example if an\norganism doesn't eat for like a day so\nyou f Ed um at that point in those\nfeeding circuits in your brain like the\naru area where these arrp neurons and\nstuff are you'll start seeing elevations\nin endoc canabo so endoc canabo levels\nstart kind of going up and up um\nfollowing kind of fasting periods and\npart of this is because they're trying\nto engage that feeding circuitry now and\nthey're Shifting the activity of those\nneurons to promote food-seeking Behavior\nbecause an organism is basically like\nenergy detecting its periphery and\nsaying oh you know we might be burning\nthrough our energy Reser reserves we\nshould probably eat more and so there\nare obviously a few mechanisms that do\nthis npy is another one and uh gin and\nthings like that so there's a lot of\nredundancy in these systems but endoc\ncan aboid are just one of the molecules\nthat seem to fine-tune like the feeding\ncircuitry and so in states of fasting\nendoc cannaboids go up explicitly in\nthat circuit and there's some evidence\nthey also go up in like the nucleus\naccumbens and affect some of the reward\ncircuitry so they're probably driving\nfood seeking behavior and enhancing the\nrewarding aspects of food at the same\ntime and so that's like a natural IND\nogous mechanism to regulate feeding B\nbased on nutritional State THC on the\nother hand you know it hits the brain\nyes some of it's going to be the\nintoxication but in tandem you're going\nto hit the CB1 receptors that are in\nthose feeding circuits as well and the\nconsequence of that is going to be I\nmean the way I kind of analogize it to\npeople is I say it's almost like\ntricking the brain into thinking that\nyou've been fasting because you're now\nactivating receptors that are normally\nactivated following kind of a fasting\nState and as a consequence of that it\npushes someone or an organism or human\nor whatever into a state of food seeking\nBehavior because now food also has high\nreward value and they're kind of the way\ntheir food circuitry is responding in\nthe brain at least seems to be similar\nto what would happen if they' been\nfasted and the thought is that's why\nwhen people you know when someone gets\nStone they're not like going eat lettuce\nthey want high calorie food they tend to\nlike things that are high carb high fat\nthat that combo seems to be what people\nlike when they're intoxicated with\ncannabis and that comes with a lot of\ncalories and the point of that would be\ntrying to replenish lost energy stores\nand so this at least is the kind of the\ntheory that I have about what it is that\nit's doing is you know and I think you\ncan make this analogy for multiple\ndifferent things you know if we talk\nabout pain or stress we can say similar\nkinds of things are going on is that\nendoc canabo normally do one thing but\nwhen THC hits the brain it's still\nactivating these circuits in addition to\neverything else it hits so you still\ndrive that response that the endoc\ncanabo system normally physiologically\ncontrols but you're almost like tricking\nthe brain into thinking you're in that\nState now and so then you then yeah you\ngo into food seeking Behavior mode super\ninteresting well I have to imagine that\nthere are many people who use cannabis\nnot to stimulate appetite but for other\nreasons they either like the Euphoria or\nto adjust their anxiety um what are some\nother known mechanisms by which um\ncannabis can change people's psychology\num let me focus in on one particular uh\naspect of subjective experience which is\nFocus do you think that some people use\ncannabis because it allows them to focus\nbetter um and I rais this specifically\nbecause I think that in the past uh\ncannabis has had a bit of a reputation\nfor making people Spacey you use the\nword stoned I'm kind of out of it and\nyet I've heard of some potential uses\nfor enhancing Focus I mean honestly this\nis a bit of a tricky one to speak to\nbecause I just don't think there's good\nevidence for it um either way or I just\ndon't I mean as far as I'm aware it\nhasn't been studied in a lot of depth I\nmean there's some things you know a lot\nof the stuff that's been done is usually\nmore like kind of acute memory tasks\nlike a working memory or recall or\nsomething like this as opposed to\nexplicitly studying Focus anecdotally\nthere is certainly a lot of people that\nreport that so my understanding is that\npeople who use cannabis have poorer\ncertain forms of memory but not\nnecessarily poorer memory across the\nboard is that correct I don't think I\nwould say that I don't think you could\nlump anything in that context I mean I\nwould say the only thing can say\nconfidently that I would be comfortable\nsaying is that acutely while someone's\nintoxicated on cannabis there is\ndefinitely shortterm effects on memory\nprocessing so people tend to negative\neffects or enhancements or decrements I\nwould say most of it has to do with\nrecall or consolidation so there does\nseem to be some I mean certainly the\nanimal evidence is very compelling there\nbut again we can talk to what some of\nthe limitations of that are um but in\nhumans I would say most of the work\nthat's been done would suggest there is\nsome short-term memory deficits that are\npresent during the intoxicated State I\nhave not seen very much compelling\nevidence of long-term effects that\nemerge like when someone's not\nintoxicated but they use cannabis\nsomewhat regularly I don't think there's\nanything compelling for that um and even\nin that case like Carrie Cutler who's at\nWashington State she's done a lot of\nthis stuff looking at cognitive\nprocessing and different kinds of memory\ntasks in users while they're stoned\noften and within a person either they\nhave adapted to using it as much as as\nthey do or they've developed some form\nof tolerance to it but even in regular\nusers the impact on memory processing is\nusually not super robust um it's still\nthere I mean I think the effects that\nare more often seen in kind of um let's\nsay smaller laboratory studies where\nthey're using people who've used\ncannabis but aren't regular users might\nbe a little bit more profound because\nthey may not be you know used to that\nstate let's say I mean there's certainly\nsomething we call State dependent\nlearning which I'm sure you're familiar\nwith um and this is something people I\nmean I remember learning about this in\nundergrad through alcohol so like you\nknow someone first time they get drunk\ntries doing something they're very bad\nat the task but if every time they're\ndrunk they do that task they become\nbetter at doing it under the influence\nand so then all of a sudden you know\nthey regularly do this task while\nthey're drunk and someone tests them and\nthey don't look like they're impaired at\nall because they've done it so much and\nso I should just say this point has\noften been confused by undergraduates\nand others to assume that just because\none can gain proficiency at a task while\nunder the influence of a substance does\nnot mean that you have higher\nproficiency at that particular task\nwhile under the influence in fact the\nway it was presented to me when I was an\nundergraduate um uh was incorrect the I\nremember the lecturer said and later\ncorrected himself um I won't call him\nout here because that's unfair he's not\nhere to defend himself but it happens in\nlectures um that people who studied Dr\ndrunk would be better off coming to the\nexam drunk that is not true from what I\nunderstand I don't think better off no\nbut they would probably score better\nthan someone who had never studied drunk\nand came to the test drunk correct just\nbecause they had had some State\ndependent learning uh and so I think\nwhen we're talking about if you're\ntalking about someone who's a chronic\ncannabis user they're going to have done\na lot of cognitive tasks while they're\nunder the influence and so if you\nacutely test them the impairment you\nmight see in them is probably less than\nyou would see in someone who's\nrelatively naive or much less\nexperienced user that being said I think\nit's relatively well established most\npeople would agree that uh acutely\nintoxication with cannabis doesn't paare\nmemory processes in some capacity what\nexplicit form of memory I don't think I\ncould speak too comfortably just because\nI'm not a memory researcher and I know\nthere's very specific things of like\nepisodic and declarative and whatnot so\num I can't say that but I'd say it's\nkind of generally and I mean again you\ncan replicate this in animals where if\nyou train them on a task while they're\nunder the influence they don't seem to\nhave consolidated information as well um\nbut again I don't really think there's\nsuper compelling evidence that there's\nkind of long-term permanent effects on\ncognitive function in individuals who\nuse cannabis at least I've never seen\nanything that's replicable or reliable\nor or stable in anyway so yeah thanks\nfor clarifying that and also thank you\nfor clarifying the um discrepancy\nbetween endogenous cannabinoid binding\nand affinity for CB1 versus THC I really\nappreciate that because that's something\nthat you and I discuss in light of the\nsolo episode I did about cannabis and uh\nnow you've made it clear uh that THC\ndoes not bind with much higher Affinity\nit's just as you I think your words were\nit assuming high THC levels in the\nCannabis carpet Bombs all the networks\nas opposed to binding more uh with\nhigher Affinity at particular receptors\nyeah I mean I don't actually even think\nit matters if it's high THC in the\nCannabis I think like some people can\nget very intoxicated off of very very\nlow doses of cannabis is that right I\nmean you look at Edibles for example I\nmean this may be an interesting segue\ninto rot of administration stuff because\nI think it's an important point that a\nlot of people don't recognize is the\ndifference between someone inhaling\ncannabis versus someone orally consuming\ncannabis is like a different game yeah\nlet's talk about this because I know\nthat um you and I um arrived at\ndifferent understanding of the fastest\ntypical and slowest um routes of Entry\num for uh THC into the system um into to\nget to arrive at the brain right um the\nnumbers I gave in the previous\ndiscussion about this were related to\nhow quickly inhaled smoke moves from the\nlungs to the bloodstream and crosses the\nbloodb brain barrier which is very fast\nright which is very fast um I don't know\nif it's different than nicotine I'm not\nsure again I don't know if I would say\nthat but yeah I it's very fast okay so\nso there may be um it may be that it is\nthe same as nicotine it may be that it's\nfaster but um importantly it it can be\nfast but but typically how fast is the\nonset set of the subjective experience\nof okay um you know somebody takes a hit\noff a joint or a bong hit and they start\nto experience the subjective effects of\neuphoria Etc how quickly after two to\nfive minutes I would say fast I mean so\nthis is one of the things with cannabis\nis and again this will kind of go into\nthis idea of the change in potency of\nthe plant as well\num it's pretty quick and people titrate\ncannabis pretty well like at least\npeople who've used it a couple times and\nunderstand this I've seen some people\nnot tit trate it very well depending\nagain on how you so again this can vary\nso like you know cannabis from the 70s\nwas like I don't know 5% THC let's say\nit was pretty low uh and nowadays\ncannabis is a lot of the commercial\nstuff is between 20 and 30 although\nwhether those are super accurate numbers\nnot entirely clear but so it's gone up a\nfair amount um yeah I mean that's a\nthat's not just a fair amount that's I\nmean if we if we were talking about alol\nconcentration be of vodka yeah basically\nyou're talking about a beer or a wine to\na spirit and there are aquavit varieties\nso to speak um by the way I think when\npeople um hear me talk about any kind of\nuh drug that can be used recreationally\nor alcohol I think some people assume\nthat you know I'm um ult Ultra anti all\nthese things I'm actually not right I'm\nnot an alcoholic so I can um drink a\nlittle bit and I have I just don't tend\nto and um we could discuss cannabis in a\ndifferent venue um but the uh the point\nhere is\nwe're not trying to frame this as what\npeople should or shouldn't do we're just\ntrying to inform people I want to be\nvery very clear about that so um but\nwhen I hear about you know um 20 to 30%\nconcentration as opposed to you know 5%\nconcentration that's significant so I\nwould say this is what's super\ninteresting and this was something that\ncame out of the way that cannabis\nresearch is done certainly in the states\nand Canada's been quite behind on this\neven with legalization we haven't caught\nup um but they have been doing lab-based\nstudies of cannabis you know mag Haney\nHarriet dwit there's cluster of\nresearchers around the country Zea\nCooper at UCLA here have all done this\nwhere you know you have people come into\nthe lab you give them cannabis you\nmeasure subjective outcomes or\nneuroimaging outcomes or whatnot so to\ndo this you can't use commercial\ncannabis and pre even like the\nstate-by-state legalizations hasn't\nChang this so if you are doing cannabis\nresearch in humans and you're funded by\nlike naida which is National Institute\nof drug abuse\num you get all your cannabis sourced I\nmean this may be changing I think there\nare some shifts that are happening but\nhistorically in all the literature that\nwe would talk about that's kind of pre\nthe last couple years all that cannabis\ncame from one source which was I believe\na farm in like Mississippi that was\nessentially funded by naida to produce\ncannabis lucky farm and well the\nCannabis that came out of it though and\nthis is one of the reasons a lot of the\nclinical stuff people have kind of been\nlike oh I don't know how representative\nthis is cuz it reflects cannabis that I\nwould say is more from like the 70s or '\n80s so it would be like 5 to 9% kind of\nTHC cannabis now when you put someone in\na lab setting and you get them to smoke\nto level of\nintoxication people would take you know\nwhatever eight toes let's say something\nlike that um and that's where they would\nstop and so you know a lot of the labs\nthat use this have always been like our\npeople who are regular canabus users are\ngetting high off of it it's not as\npotent as the stuff that's on the street\nbut they're clearly getting intoxicated\nfrom it and it's giving us reliable data\num so when they started looking at the\nblood levels of THC that you achieve it\nwas around 100 nanograms per male of THC\ngive or take that seemed to be where it\nwas now because of the way that the you\ncan legally study Canada Cannabis in the\nStates you couldn't just go down to a\ndispensary and buy the products that\neveryone on the street are using which\nis kind of like it's been a weird thing\nfor a lot of people because they're like\nwhy wouldn't you study what we're using\nbut because of the legal aspects of this\nyou could bring those products into the\nlab they'd never been standardized no\none knew exactly what was in them\npesticides all this other stuff that\ncould influence it so from a safety\nperspective it was always like no you\nuse the the Cannabis that sourced from\nnaida um so there's a group in Colorado\nKent Hutchinson and Angela Bryan and\ncinnamon Bidwell have kind of I would\nsay became very creative actually to\nfigure out how to study cannabis that's\nbeing used I call it in the wild like in\nkind of an ecological sense setting\nlet's say and so they created what was\ncalled the canavan and the canavan was a\nway to study people using products on\nthe street but not have them come into a\nlaboratory setting where it was\ncomplicated and so what they would do is\nthey would drive the canavan to\nsomeone's house but they'd be parked on\nthe street and someone would use the\nproduct whatever it was on in their own\nproperty and their own time and then\ncome into the canavan to have blood\ntaken to look at what their THD levels\nare and to undergo testing so it was\nactually like I think this was a a great\nadvance in the field because it was this\nhuge Innovative approach that allowed us\nto start comparing what we've learned\nfrom Lab based settings with this kind\nof old school weed that was coming from\nnaida with what is being used on the\nstreet I love this I mean as somebody\nwhose lab has done a in laboratory\nvr-based experiment on human anxiety and\nfear and then compared that to a you\nknow a clinical study that we did sort\nof in Mass where people were at home\ndoing specific respiration practices you\nhave many more subjects but of course\nthey're reporting back their effects um\nwell you can monitor them by device you\nknow look at HRV look at heart rate Etc\num I think having the ability to compare\nand contrast in laboratory and X\nlaboratory data is extremely valuable\nand I mean my view is you need both\nbecause you need the in laboratory for\nthe control because we all need control\nover various things but you also need\nthe ecological validity to see how it\nshakes out and make sure it looks the\nsame yeah for people that have never\nbeen to a laboratory or tried to find a\nparking spot at a university that's an\nanxiety inducing experience of itself a\nnovel experience while someone's\nintoxicated with cannabis can also\ncreate a very different altered state I\nwouldn't want to be stoned in a\nlaboratory I'll tell you that much I\nfeel like there's pluses and minuses to\nboth sides but I think the data together\nis very compelling and that's where we\nget a lot of advance in the field so\nwhat uh Kent Angela and cinnamon did\nwith the canavan was kind of create this\nsituation that allowed this research to\noccur and what we found fascinating I\nremember talking to me Haney about this\nbecause all the people in her lab setes\ntended to always hit around 100\nnanograms per male using this relatively\nlower potency cannabis when Kenton and\nAngela and cinnamon started studying\nthis in the people and taking blood\ndespite the fact that these people are\nnow using cannabis that's 20 to 30%\ntheir blood levels are the same so\nthey're still coming in around 100\nnanograms per male because people are\nreally good at self\ntitrating now where Things Fall Apart is\nwith the concentrates so then you go\ninto things like dabs or these like high\npotency products that are now like cuz\ncannabis itself realistically from what\nI understand from the botanist that I've\ntalked to you can't really grow a plant\nthat's going to exceed more than 25 to\n30% THC just by sheer biology so it Taps\nout there that's about as high as it's\ngoing to go concentrates can go up to\nlike 90 98% so you can get really really\nis there\ntinctures distillates like yeah various\njust in oilbased forms that are very\nvery high potency\nproducts those are incredibly\nchallenging to tight trade like they\ncannot be tight traded because the sheer\nvolume of THC that hits the system even\nfrom a single hit is so overwhelming and\nso when the Colorado group looked at\nthose their blood levels were closer to\n200 300 nanograms per Mill so with\ncannabis planned there does seem to be\nthis ability for people to relatively\nself- titrate and then my buddy Ryan\nmcglaughlin who's also at Washington\nState he was really one of the ones that\npioneered these Vape Chambers and rats\nand created this really cool model of uh\nself-administration which was like a\nvery important thing to actually\nestablish because it was very\nchallenging to get rodents to self-\nadminister cannabis if you're doing like\nan IV approach or something else because\nthey found it quite aversive but when\nyou let rodents actually tighter their\nability to get Vape hits they will like\nwork for this the same way they well\nother reinforcing drugs so it was a\nreally important finding that you could\ndo this um and what Ryan found was he\nactually did one study where he gave\nthem access to a low potency product a\nwe'll call it me medium and then a high\nand what you ended up if you look at the\ndata is the one the rats like the best\nwas the medium potency product\ninteresting and if you gave them the\nhigh potency product they would actually\ntake less Vape hits off that than they\nwould off the lower ones and again all\ntheir blood levels tended to Cluster in\nthe same range because they titrated\nlike even at the at the rodent level\nthey're able to titrate because of the\nlag between inhalation and feeling the\neffects is only on the order of a couple\nof minutes people can titrate better I\nmean not just people it seems like the\nrodents can as well so the higher\npotency cannabis where it becomes a\nproblem is if someone's highly\ninexperienced and they consume a whole\nbunch of it without allowing that time\nlag to occur um and then they can\nprobably exceed the levels they intended\nto and consume too much and then have a\nprobably an adverse response so does\nthat mean that cannabis use rarely leads\nto tolerance of cannabis\nuse I wouldn't say that there's\ndefinitely some degree of Tolerance the\nToler is definitely more prominent when\npeople start using concentrates there's\nno question about that I mean we can\ntalk about the concentrates I guess\nseparately after because I would say if\nwe're talking about a harm reduction\nthing that's that's more where we need\nto focus a lot more is this idea of\nthese high potency products yeah sounds\nlike those are are precarious that\nsomebody who thinks they have a lot of\nexperience or God forbid no experience\ntakes a concentrate and is what no\nlonger um getting the euphoric\nexperience that they anticipated but\ninstead are getting what a a paranoid\nanxiety\nI think I think you're you're far more\nlikely to go overboard and have an\nadverse response but also I think the\nproblem is if you're using a product of\nthat potency and that much THC floods\nyour system on a regular basis the\nbiological changes from that are going\nto be very different then what you get\nif again you're titrating your your THC\nfrom um inhaling plant at roughly the\nsame level whether that's a 10% 5% or\n25% people generally tend to scale right\nthis is a very important point and I'm\ngoing to highlight it because I think\nit's um it's very very very important\nalthough you're making it very clearly\nalready which is these days we hear a\nlot about the quote unquote problems\nwith high THC containing cannabis as\nrelative to what was um present in the\n70s and 80s and presumably 90s as well\nyeah I'm a uh I was a teen in the 90s so\nmaybe I'm alluding to to something there\num but what you're saying is that unless\none is talking about concentrates that\npeople and animals in the laboratory\nwill self-regulate the amount of intake\nin a way that leads to approximately the\nsame blood levels of THC so it may not\nbe as much of a concern at least in\nlight of the concerns about oh these\nlevels are so high that um people are\noverwhelming their system with THC\nbasically um this could be stated in\nreal world terms as people are taking\nfewer tokes um of the higher\nconcentration stuff that allow them to\nmatch blood levels that were present in\nthe person taking many more toes in the\n70s so the joke I always make to people\nis they say go watch a chich and Chong\nmovie from the late '70s look at the\nsize of the joints that they smoke in\nmovies like that relative to what you\nwould see someone on the street\nconsuming nowadays like it's just I mean\nso the advantage that existed from a\ntitration perspective was with like 70s\nweed there's a large window to titrate\nso people could you know take small\namounts and not over consume let's say\nbecause there was a much lower\nconcentration of THC in the plant so\nthey're able to consume assume you know\neven if they were doing it relatively\nfast because of how little THC was\ncoming into the system it was a little\neasier to scale that so there certainly\nis the propensity for people to overc\nconsume higher potency cannabis even\nindependent of concentrates if they're\nnot allowing that titration to occur\nalso if you have someone who is just\nexquisitely sensitive to THC for various\nreasons um even one or two toes could be\ntoo much for them because at the higher\npotency they they may not have that\nability to titrate quite as well\nand so a lot of people um anecdotally\nyou talk to people about cannabis and a\nlot of people who don't like cannabis\nhave say oh you know I've tried the new\nstuff's too strong and if there's\nsomeone who's kind of more in our age\nrange who grew up in an earlier decade\nwhere things were a bit different they\nmay be referencing their own experience\nfrom when they were younger and what\nthey were able to consume and now they\ntry doing the same and it hits them like\na sledgehammer so it's a little\ndifferent in that sense but you know and\nI don't think it's to say it's like not\nconcerning that cannabis is as high as\nTHC as it is I just think if I'm going\nto put my efforts into kind of like you\nknow Public Health perspectives of this\nI would be digging my feet in much more\nabout the access to concentrates and the\nissues and the potential harms that are\ngoing to come with them than I would\nabout the Cannabis flower myself that's\njust my opinion based on what I see with\nthe concerns and what we've seen from\nthe data in humans and I think the the\nreal world e ecological studies that the\nColorado group have done have been very\ninformative in this sense because yeah\nif the if the blood levels of THD you\nachieve from concentrates are double to\nTriple of what you get even from higher\npotency flour that's a concern like I\nthink that's where problems start\narising because then you're going to\nstart seeing a lot higher degree of\nTolerance I mean there used to be more\nof a debate in the field as to whether\npeople develop tolerance because one of\nthe things with cannabis that I do find\nvery interesting is with a lot of\nchronic users they don't escalate the\nway you would see with cocaine or\nalcohol where there's very profound\ntolerance that develops and so I mean\npeople definitely see this in cocaine\nwhere people can become um tolerant\nalmost immediately and so dosing starts\nscaling up very fast yeah usually it's\nthe life destruction that that thwarts\ntheir Progressive increase seriously or\nthe cost I mean the sheer cost another\nform of life life life life\ndeterioration yeah that is required to\nbe able to maintain that but with\ncannabis um it seems like there is some\ndegree of Tolerance that people exhibit\nit varies from person to person but you\nknow as like I've you know as me has\nsaid to me many times you know the guys\nthat come in her studies these are very\nheavy users and then you know they will\nuse this relatively low potency product\nand still get high off of it and so it's\nnot to say that there's no tolerance\nit's just it's not as profound as I\nthink we see with a lot of other drugs\nand this is probably due to the fact of\njust like you know we definitely see\nlike if we look at some PET Imaging\nstudies chronic cannabis users do have\nsome down sorry I have to interrupt pet\npositron emission tomography not pets um\ndon't although people get their pets\nhigh and we don't know what those uh\npets think about that not good don't get\ndogs if also High one can assume a lot\nof things about what your pet is\nthinking while also High um sort of half\njoke there um but yes positron emission\ntomography is one way to assess their\nbinding of um drugs within the brain as\nwell as activity of endogenous uh\nneurotransmitters neuromodulators such\nas um anandamide uh dopamine Etc yeah so\nso a typical pet study in a human\nlooking at this they'd give a molecule\nthat's radi labeled that will bind a CB1\nreceptor\nyou can scan them uh and then look at\nthe emission rates of the radiation to\nget an idea of the density of receptors\nthat are in the brain chronic cannabis\nusers tend to have less um what that\nmeans in terms\nof the functional outcome is unclear I\nmean there could be some I think there's\na there's a lot of evidence that there's\nsome degree of a reservoir of CB1\nreceptors that you know there might be a\nlot more receptors there than we\nnecessarily always need or are always\nusing let's say so we might be\ndownregulating\ncomponent of this but maybe not all of\nthe ones that are required to produce\nthe psychoactive effects because there's\nclearly some maintenance of the system\nthat allows someone to continue to get\nintoxicated uh and so with cannabis\nusers we do see that but you do see much\nmore profound tolerance with people\nusing High potency extracts and\nconcentrates and things like this and\nagain Sheely I think as a response to\nthe biology of hitting the system that\nheavily with that much you know THD as\nit comes in because they can't titrate\nit the same way it makes sense yeah\nthese concentrates sound like something\nto at least pay attention to as a\npotential problem I'd like to take a\nquick break and acknowledge our sponsor\ninsid tracker insid tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals now\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason that many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test now major problem\nwith a lot of blood tests out there is\nthat you get information back about\nmetabolic factors and hormones and\nlipids and so forth but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information with\ninside tracker they make it very easy to\nknow what to do with those numbers\nbecause they have a personalized\nplatform that allows you to see the\nlevels of those metabolic factors lipids\nhormones Etc and they give you specific\ndirectives that you can follow related\nto nutrition behavioral modification\nsupplementation and more that can help\nyou bring those numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you if you'd like\nto try insid tracker you can go to insid\ntracker.com huberman to

previous episode on I did on\ncannabis um I've known a lot of chronic\ncannabis users um and none of them admit\nto being addicted um it's not my place\nto uh challenge them on that but they do\nseem in my experience this is not an\nexperiment U but in my experience more\nirritable when they don't have access to\nwhat they call their quote unquote\nmedicine yeah so um you know that speaks\nto a dependence or something um but then\nwe need to be careful because in the\nclassic sense addiction you know I've\ndefined and others in the field of\naddiction um have defined it as a you\nknow Progressive narrowing of the things\nthat bring you pleasure such that you\nknow it causes um disruption to other\nareas of life your life becomes\nmaladaptive yeah I mean I'm not going to\nplay with the definition of addiction I\nfeel like I have enough friends in the\naddiction space and it's a very\ncontentious field so I mean I will try\nand not use that word although I\nunderstand\ntalking to the general public that's\nkind of you know if you say someone has\na use disorder versus an addiction that\nmay not make sense to them right but\nthat's the nomenclature now that people\nare using alcohol use\ndisorder cannabis use disorder this is\nwhat you start to see now instead of\nsaying being addicted to pot or being\naddicted to alcohol and so I mean an\naddiction is obviously a very complex\nthing that again I don't want to touch\nit simply because it's not my space um\nbut that being said there's no question\nthat people can develop cannabis us\ndisorder I mean it's it's definitely a\nthing so if we say is cannabis addictive\nin kind of a you know normal lay speak I\nwould say yes it is addictive what does\nthat look like how does that relate to\nother substances of abuse I mean\ncertainly um the outcomes associated\nwith it are going to be slightly\ndifferent than someone something like\nopiates or alcohol because that's a\ntotally different Beast because you have\nuh fatality potential there's a whole\nbunch of other health consequences but\nif we look at how we would Define a\ndisorder the criteria for someone\nhitting cannabis use disorder is really\nno different than how someone would hit\nalcohol use disorder or opiate use\ndisorder in the sense that it can\nconsume their life it can shift the way\nthat they behave they can put themselves\nin Risky positions to get access to a\ndrug it can consume their time and their\nenergy to have it like you said if they\ndon't have access to it it can trigger\nyou know an assembly of behaviors that\nlooks like irritability anger\nfrustration things like that so I\nmean the numbers in terms of the\nconversion rate of use to developing use\ndisorder I would say are not entirely\nclear the kind of old numbers that used\nto get tossed around where like 9 to 11%\nof people that would start initiating\ncannabis use would probably transition\nto develop use disorder the more modern\nnumbers I would say you know if we're\nlooking at people who are already using\nweekly we're talking probably closer to\n30% like so it's a much higher I mean\nwhen you're using that frequently then\nthe rates of people who would qualify as\nhaving cannabis use disorder probably go\nhigher so so I just want to make sure\nI'm understanding clearly for people\nthat use cannabis weekly\nthe propensity for developing cannabis\nuse disorder is on the order of about\n30% yeah i' say in in that neighborhood\nthey would probably qualify as meeting\ncriteria for a cannabis use disorder\nbecause weekly doesn't seem like that\noften no I mean it's it depends again on\nhow you vary this like and I've had a\nlot of conversations with the public and\nI think depending on someone's\nexperience in their own or in their own\ninner circles life with cannabis the way\nthey would view it is very differently\ncuz I think a lot of people you know\nagain regardless of anyone's opinion of\nalcohol if someone told you they had a\nglass of wine with dinner every night I\ndon't think people would say you have an\nalcohol use disorder I think that's not\nuncom I don't think they would uh\nsimilarly if someone had a Brandy at the\nend of the night or like you know a\nnight cap to go to bed and they did that\non a nightly basis I don't think anyone\nwould say that they have a use disorder\nand I think with cannabis there are a\nlot of people that kind of fall into\nthat bracket that would use it you know\neven daily but relatively infrequently\nand kind of as an end of the day thing I\nthink some of them certainly would fall\nunder the criteria of cannabis use\ndisorders because if you start looking\nand say well you know if you travel to\nlike Egypt are you going to go put\nyourself at risk of going to jail to get\naccess to cannabis because you can't\nfunction without it if you do then yeah\nyou know you've got cannabis use\ndisorder you know are you going to burn\nrelationships are you going to start\nfailing at meeting responsibilities or\ngetting things done in time because\nyou're preoccupied with cannabis yes\nyou're GNA hit the criteria for cannabis\nuse disorder if it's someone who's kind\nof just intermittently using it the same\nway that a lot of people casually use\nalcohol I would say a lot of them\nprobably wouldn't hit criteria but I\nthink to someone who has never had\ncannabis in their Inner Circle or in\ntheir life they look at it like a drug\nlike cocaine whereas they're like wow if\nyou were using cocaine on a daily basis\nwe'd be super concerned about you and so\nI think that's this like it's just as\nyou go I mean cannabis is in this really\nweird transitionary period I would say\nof going from elicit to not just because\nof the changes in the legal regulatory\nframework I mean in Canada now we're\nlike five and a half years into\nlegalization so in many ways I would say\nthe transition has happened where a lot\nof people view cannabis very similarly\nto alcohol whereas you go to some states\nand the perspective is still very\ndifferent and certainly if you're still\nin one of the states where there's no\nlegal access people still look at\ncannabis the same way they look at a lot\nof other um illicit drugs like cocaine\nor amphetamines or things it's\ninteresting I I was under the impression\nthis has really changed over the last\nyou know 5 10 years you know growing up\nit was I mean I think there are still\npeople in jail now because of uh\npossession and sale of of cannabis and\nthen of course there are stores not far\nfrom here where people are selling can\nironic yeah sadly it's a very I mean\nobviously a big push for legalization is\nnot um endorsement of the safety of\ncannabis it's more the the harms\nassociated with prohibition outweigh the\nharms associated with legalization I\nthink that's generally the public health\nperspective that's certainly what\nmotivated it in Canada um and there was\na you know some attempts let's say at\nrestorative justice in terms of removing\ncriminal records and things may not have\nbeen entirely as successful as people\nhad hoped it would be but it certainly\nhas changed things I mean we can look at\nour federal data and see that arrest\nrates related to cannabis are obviously\nvery low compared to what they were um\nthat obviously becomes very important\nbecause there are clearly minoritized\ncommunities they get they get hit more\nwith this than other communities and so\nthe kind of Perpetual disenfranchisement\nthat happens with a Prohibition model in\ncommunities that are already suffering\nfrom various other things that affect\nthem um just potentiates all that so I\ncan understand the legal framework\nbehind why there would be a move to a\nlegalization state over a Prohibition\nstate which again a lot of people\nconfuse legality with safety which is a\nweird I mean alcohol is the perfect\nexample of this I mean you look at the\nscale of harms on a public health level\nI mean alcohol Stacks at the top it\nacross the board in terms of harms to\nthe individual harms to society it's\nit's a lot cannabis has harms there's no\nquestion on that um it just would fall\nlower than alcohol um but the way that\npeople view it a lot of people are like\nalcohol is legal therefore it's safe and\nit's not something to judge people on\ncannabis at least historically was\nillegal and in some states still is so\npeople view it very differently and I\nthink\nit's an interesting thing um because I\nfeel like you know despite the fact that\nsome people hate the government and hate\nthe way that it regulates their life\nthere's this weird passive belief that\nlike if the government dictates\nsomething is legal that means it's safe\nis the legalization of cannabis leading\nto more cannabis users or fewer um Andor\num incidents of people going into the\nemergency room uh suffering from\nCannabis induced psychosis something\nthat I hope we can also talk about yeah\num so it depends on how you break this\ndown so what we've seen in Canada is i'\nwould say there's like demographic\ndifferences uh proportionately when we\nlook at the biggest change in use it's\nactually elderly communities it's like\n55 plus um especially women over 55 tend\nto be more cannabis use more cannabis\nuse now granted their Baseline was quite\nlow pre- legalization so if you look at\na fold change it looks like a very\ndramatic increase raw numbers it's\nprobably not that that high\nbut I mean it was like 1 to 2% or\nsomething before and now it's gone up to\nlike 8% or something so it's a four-fold\nincrease kind of thing so we do see the\nmagnitude of that seems to be the\nbiggest in terms of where the uses come\nfrom definitely the young adult\npopulation like 20 24 that group has\ndefinitely seen um increase use as well\ndoes it split male female historically\ncannabis tended to be more male biased\ni' would say the the gender separation\nthere has kind of narrowed quite a bit\num where you do see a lot more like more\nfemales used and historically had um\nthere is a little bit of difference\nfemales tend to prefer Edibles over\nmales so um males tend to like\ninhalation over females so like roots of\nadministration vary a little bit based\non um who someone is but um yeah\ninterestingly we don't have a lot of\nactual indication that teenagers have\nused more um so like you know you look\nat 14 to 18 year olds that has been now\ngranted our Baseline going in was pretty\nhigh as is down here in the states I\nmean Canada and the states both hover\nyou look at like grade 12ers and you\nknow it's somewhere between 35 and 40%\nof them have used cannabis now I mean\nyou even have some that are like\nprobably around 5% are probably almost\ndaily users so like you do have a pretty\nhigh Baseline to begin with in that\ngroup but that has remained relatively\nunchanged uh if anything some of the\nstates when they legalize saw slight\ndips in in teenage use of cannabis so I\nthink like that's obviously an important\ndemographic to have ra this was one of\nthe concerns with legalization was you'd\nPro you know increase access teenagers\nwould get it from their parents and\nwhatnot or had just you know other\nsiblings and stuff and so you get this\nbig boost in consumption um but we don't\nseem to see that in terms of raw numbers\nof teenagers who are using cannabis so\nso that's good ER visits um so we did a\nan interesting role out in Canada we\nlegalized flower for a year before\nEdibles came online so we have kind of a\nbefore and after um once Edibles became\navailable there was a notable increase\nin unintentional pediatric consumption\nthat resulted in ER visits because kids\nwould you know a lot of these look like\ngummies and candies people are buying\nthem not you know storing them properly\nkids would find them and eat them and\nlike become very intoxicated I I want to\nmake mention of something along those\nlines um I actually know somebody whose\nchild um\naccidentally a at THC containing gummies\num fortunately the child was fine um but\nthey're actually pretty serious\nramifications for this um the parents\nactually are quite susceptible to uh\nlegal action if this happens right so\nthis is something to like really keep in\nmind I mean there are a million other um\nHealth rated reasons why this is\nprobably I don't know if that's true in\nCanada the same way but I in the states\nlike if if if your kid gets into uh a of\nTHC containing gummies and ends up in\nthe emergency room there will also be uh\nmost likely there'll be a police visit\nto that emergency room also and it\ndoesn't bode well for the parents so\nit's it's a very serious issue and again\nthis was highlighted to me by someone\nthat I know who um didn't anticipate any\nof this but you know kids are good at\nfinding candy yeah and if that candy\ncontains THC and they end up in the\nemergency room serious issues\nnonetheless if your kid is acting\nstrange because you think they ingested\nTHC containing anything take them to the\nemergency room anyway well so this was\none of the things that also in was\ninfluenced by legalization is in Canada\nlike some of the increase in the ER\nvisits was because of the shift in\nlegalization and the change in policy\nand so you know if your kid ends up\ndrunk underage it's not the same\nramifications as if your kid used an\nillegal substance underage and so people\nare when some once cannabis was legal\npeople were more likely to actually go\ninto the ER because the consequences\nwere different I see and so sure some of\nthis is availability and some of it is\njust like okay I'm not as concerned now\nabout something happening because I've\ntaken my kid in like I'm not going to\nhave my kid taken away from me or\nwhatnot so so there is I mean both those\nfactors I think have contributed to it\nbut we definitely see the majority at\nleast of kids ending up in the ER is\nalmost all based on Edibles that's I I\ncan't imagine a situation where that\nwould happen from inhalation it would be\nvery rare if it would it's almost always\nEdibles cuz kids find them so as long as\nwe're talking about\nEdibles is there any fundamental\ndifference between um the dose\nregulation that you talked about earlier\nof inhalants versus uh excuse me versus\nEdibles um meaning earlier you said that\neven if it's high THC containing uh\ncannabis people will self-regulate to\nachieve the same approximately the same\nblood concentrations but with Edibles I\nimagine you eat half a cookie a quarter\nof a cookie and um you can end up in a\nvastly different place than you expected\nso Edibles so this throw is a wrench in\nthe whole system and I'll say this in\nthe context of blood levels and then\nwhat that means for my regulatory\ncapacity as well because of the impact\nthis has so Edibles are very low doses\nfor the most part um I mean in Canada at\nleast you cannot buy a pack of Edibles\nand I think this law might be changing\nat least when they first brought it in\nno pack could have more than 10\nmilligrams of THC in it so that either\nmeant one 10 Mig gummy or two five Mig\ngummies or four 2.5 Mig gummies you get\nit um so you couldn't in one package\nhave more than 10 milligrams of THC now\nfor people who are I would say\nrelatively naive to cannabis or THC even\npeople who might use it\nintermittently most people will feel\nfive milligrams like they'll feel some\nform of intoxication you know some will\neven feel it at 2.5 migs most people\nwill feel it at five virtually everyone\nwill feel it at 10 now if you look at\nthe blood levels these produce we're now\ntalking blood levels of 2 to 5 nanograms\nper Mill so folds lower than what you\nget from inhalation before you said 100\nyeah so this is dramatically lower and\nso also the time course of this is\nfundamentally different so an uh oral\nconsumption you know you're looking at a\nminimum of 30 to 45 minutes for onset of\nintoxication for some people up to 90\nminutes after they've eaten now this is\nalso the reason why the majority of\nAdverse Events that happen with cannabis\nhappen with Edibles because people don't\nunderstand this and so they eat a cookie\nor a gummy they wait half an hour like\nI'm not feeling anything I clearly\ndidn't take enough and then they'll\ndouble their dose and then like 15\nminutes later it starts hitting them and\nthen like once it fully kicks in it's\njust like a steamroller like I've heard\nof this happening yeah I mean there was\nthat New York I think it was Morin Dow\nor someone went down to Colorado and she\nate like an insane amount of THC in a\nchocolate bar or something like 50 or\n100 milligrams and spent like the\nweekend on the floor of a hotel room\nbeing like this was the most aversive\nexperience why would anyone do this um\nand again I think people just don't\nunderstand the dosing around this and so\nthis is one of the things we're trying\nto do in Canada and I was create this\nidea of standardized dosing units so\nthat people have like we we with alcohol\nwe always say one beer is the equivalent\nto one glass of wine versus you know\nlike a shot of tequila or something so\nthat there's some uh comparator that\npeople understand how many drinks are\nyou know you know say two drinks you do\nyou're going to hit legal limit kind of\nthing it seems very important yeah and\nso this is very difficult to do with\ncannabis because the dosing with oral\nconsumption is just a different ball\ngame it is with inhalation but what\nhappens with oral consumption is like it\nkind of very slowly leaks out of the GI\ntra and it also goes through first P\nmetabolism in the liver and what happens\nthere is you get a metabolite called 11\nhydroxy THC\nwhich seems to be a bit more potent than\nTHC is in terms of its ability to\nactivate the receptor so its efficacy at\nleast at driving a response through CB1\nreceptors seems to be higher than what\nyou would get uh with just the parent\nmolecule of THC itself\nself um and so and it it seems to\naccumulate a lot more as well so at any\ngiven time you know you've got THC kind\nof leaking out of the gut going through\nthe liver making 11 hydroxy and it\nprogressively accumulates in the brain\nand that's one of the reasons why it\ntakes you know 45 to 90 minutes to kick\nin but then the high itself also lasts\nlike six hours four to six sometimes\neight depending on the person what\nthey've eaten versus inhalation is just\nthis like Spike so you get this very\nrapid because it goes right through the\nlungs into the blood goes into the brain\nbut it also clears out and so yeah\npeople will start feeling intoxicated\ntwo to 5 minutes they the peak high is\nlike 15 to 30 minutes maybe from\nconsumption and then they'll start to\ncome back down and you will still see\nsome indications of intoxication that\ncan go on for 3 to four hours but the\nbulk of the intoxication from inhalation\nis done by two hours for the most part\nas long as we're on the topic of time\ncourse um you know based on what I was\nable to find\num I believed and tell me if I was wrong\nthat cannabis can stay in one system for\nas long as 80 Days the reason I brought\nthis up yeah um previously was there are\na number of people who have used\ncannabis are going to take a drug test\nand want to know how fast it can clear\nfrom their system um but based on\nconversations we had offline um sounds\nlike that 80 Days might be a bit too\nlong I mean you could still fail a drug\ntest at 8s I would say I feel like I\nthink I think the way it was worded more\nwas like that you made it sound like\nthat was the standard I wouldn't say\nthat was the standard at all I would say\nfor the majority of people 30 days\nprobably after that they would not pass\nor they would be able to pass a drug\ntest but that so abstinence for 30 days\nyeah after abstaining for 30 days and\nit's going to be highly variable\ndepending on how much you consume I mean\nif you're talking about someone who's\nused it once I I don't imagine it would\nbe in your system that long that'd be\nsurprising the thing is THC is a\nlipophilic\nfat so it's fat soble it likes the stor\nit doesn't like the blood the blood is\naquous and watery it likes fat so it\ngoes into the brain it goes into the fat\nand it kind of resides there and it can\nessentially kind of slowly leak back as\nit as you know THC concentrations in the\nblood would reduce THC that's in the fat\nwill start kind of leaking back into the\nblood still so detectably you will still\nhave THC for quite some time I mean some\nof this again it's going to be dependent\non how much cannabis someone's used how\nmuch THC they've consumed how long it's\nbeen in their system for I would have\nthought this was going to be somewhat\nreflective of people's body fat content\nalthough talking to colleagues who do\nthis they say not always um but we do\nknow you know certain things like\nexercise for example anything that's\ngoing to trigger adrenaline because\nadrenaline is lipolytic so adrenaline\ncauses fat to metabolize and release\nstuff that's inside it so there are\nplenty of cases I've heard from people\nwhere they were testing themselves and\nwere negative and then went for a run or\nwent to the gym and then tested positive\nor lost weight yeah or they've lost\nweight and anything that's going to\ncause the the lipolysis to occur so that\nit releases that\nTHC um you can certainly all of a sudden\ntest positive again when someone had\ntested negative previously just because\nof the fact that there still is some in\nthe fat and so this is where something\nlike and this is what I mean by\nstandardization of regulatory issues\nbecome very complicated was remember\nright when legalization happened in\nCanada all these kind of chemists were\nlike talking to me about they're going\nto create like a breathalyzer for\ncannabis because this way they'll be\nable to do roadside detection the same\nway they could do with alcohol and I\nkept trying to say to them I'm like the\nrate limiting step here is not the\nscience of detection thresholds it's the\nbiology of how the body processes\ncannabis and you're never going to get a\ntest that works because you can take\nsomeone who has eaten an edible and is\nprofoundly intoxicated at and they will\nhave possibly under 5 nanog per Mill of\nTHC in their blood but you were talking\nabout this metabolite that can come from\nthe uh Edibles that doesn't come from\ninhalants that can have a much more get\nbit from inhalent but not nearly as much\nas you get from Edibles um so it's a\ndifferent it's sort of a different\nsituation altogether it is but it's also\nthe timeline because of the fact that\nwith inhalation it's like a a a bolus\nthat hits you at once so you get a high\nblood level um with Edibles it's like\nthe time course so I mean it's going to\nbe like 5 nanog per Mill let's say but\nit would be like that for a long time\nwhereas the 100 nanogram per Mill from\nsmoking is like for 20 minutes and then\nit starts dropping so but the problem is\nwith the way that um you detect it is\nyou can take someone who's a chronic\ncannabis user and is completely sober\nand hasn't consumed in a day or two and\ntheir basil levels of THC in their blood\nmay be higher than someone who's\nprofoundly Intoxicated by an edible just\nby the sheer nature of the fact that it\nwould reside in their fat tissue or\ntheir it would leak back into the blood\nand so you have this issue where you\nlet's say your cut off was 5 nanograms\nper Mill which is for some of the stuff\ndetection thresholds would hover around\nthat area so you could have someone\nwho's dead sober that tests positive and\nsomeone who's profoundly intoxicated who\ntest negative so it's like what's the\nvalue in this it's it's not telling us\nanything well I guess it sounds like the\ndrug tests either have to be revised or\ndiscarded and it also sounds like if\nsomebody is going to take a drug test\nfor cannabis and they have used cannabis\nin any form in uh the previous 90 days\nlet's say uh going for a run right\nbefore your test is going to liberate uh\nwhatever um THC resides in the fat\nstores potentially yeah so I mean it it\nis it is a lot of people are writing\nthis\ndown along the lines of what's known and\nnot known I'm curious uh what is known\nand not known about the effects of\ncannabis THC in particular on hormones\num I've seen studies that site increases\nin testosterone from cannabis use I've\nseen studies that site increases in\nestrogen from cannabis use and they\nargue for increased aromatization of\ntestosterone into estrogen as the\nmechanism I've also seen studies that\nsay the exact opposite yeah so um is\nthere any Global takeaway message yet or\nis it just highly variable or depends\ntoo much on dose and individual age Etc\nthat we just really can't see I would\nsay it's you it's there's nothing that's\nsuper clean cut um I mean I know in the\nprevious podcast you talked about a\nprolactin thing right well there there's\num and this is where I think it's\nimportant that people understand um that\nyou know on this podcast we cover\nscience and studies but we also pull\nfrom common experience that people want\nexplained if we can um and one of the\nexperiences that is talked about a lot\nin certain um let's just say online\ncommunities is the experience of people\nwho had no pre-existing gynocomastia\nmale breast development yeah will smoke\ndoes do we call it marijuana these days\nI got we'll go with cannabis I actually\ngot I got um someone I got a lot of\ncomments that said marijuana is an\ninappropriate term okay smoke well go\nback to that I I that was new to me I\ndidn't know so forgive me if I I mean I\nunderstand it but yeah a lot of people\ndon't know that so um will'll smoke\ncannabis and experience gynecomastia or\nin females so males and females both\nhave breast tissue but in males it's\ntypically um uh it's not hypertrophied\num but they'll smoke cannabis and get a\num gomia growth of the male breast\ntissue um that's sometimes reversible\nsometimes not presumably through the\naromatization of testosterone into\nestrogen which then acts on the tissue\nmakes it grow as well as um reports of\nbreast tissue tenderness after cannabis\nuse in in females so that was sort of\nthe origin of that discussion around\ndoes cannabis impact aromatization of\ntestosterone into estrogen and you can\nfind a little bit of evidence for that\nbut you can also find evidence to the\ncontrary in the scientific literature\nI'm just curious your thoughts it's\nsuper mixed so I mean you talk about\nsomething like prolactin for example\nthat is another one that's obviously\ninvolved in in this whole Cascade stuff\ngenerally I would say the the bulk of\nthe literature actually says that\ncannabis would suppress prolactin not\nincrease it that's the majority of the\nliter because dopamine is one of the\nmain ways that prolactin is suppressed\nthey're kind of in a seesaw they work in\nsomewhat seesaw fashion um and it\nprobably I mean the rodent work would\nsuggest it's through dopamine that's\nturning off prolactin because you can\nreverse some of these Effects by playing\nwith\nso I don't doubt that's the mechanism\nbut so typically I would say more often\nI mean there's studies with inhalation\nand IV that have generally found reduced\nuh prolactin and in chronic canvas users\nthey find somewhat lower resting states\nof prolactin that's been found in one\nstudy that came out of Yale interes um\ntestosterone gets a little bit more\ncomplicated because there are a lot of\nstudies that find a to begin with\ncannabis users may have higher levels of\ntestosterone just at rest now whether\nthat's a pre-existing any reason to\nthink that would be the case I don't\nknow I yeah I mean that being said a lot\nof the stuff now granted this was mostly\ndone in the\n70s um and like this is from my previous\nlife because my undergrad and graduate\nsupervisor he was a neur endocrinologist\nfocused much more on sex hormones and\nreproductive hormones so we've written a\nfew reviews so I've done like reviews on\nthis area and I know the literature\nsomewhat um it's mixed but generally\nfrom the70s studies what they would\noften see is that if they um would look\nserially look at testosterone after\nsomeone consumed they would have little\ndips like that wasn't uncommon for them\nto find it not every study found it um\nthat being said the kind of range the\ntestosterone stayed in was always the\nnormative range like it was never that\nit went so low that someone would have\nclassified as being hypogonadal or would\nlead to something like gyom at least\nfrom a testosterone deficiency side in\nterms of the balance between\ntestosterone and estr\num I don't know as much about the\naromatization side of it again I'd say\nit's pretty mixed I mean I don't think\nthe gyne kamasa stuff is I mean\ncertainly people online might be talking\nabout it and there might be some other\ncomponents to this I've also heard and\nagain this isn't like science this is\njust the same kind of stuff you see on\nrandom internet communities people\ntalking about oh well you know it has\nplant estrogen so maybe they're subbing\nin and having estrogenic effects I don't\nknow how valid any of this is yeah it\nseems a bit I mean they're f estrogens\nand tons of different plants the sort of\nattacks on soy and the attacks on uh\nthis I think grew out of the um kind of\nthe soy versus meat communities and\nplant-based versus carnivore this\npodcast has always been agnostic with\nrespect to nutrition and is really um if\nwe encourage anything it's that people\nconsume um unprocessed and minimally\nprocessed foods um as the bulk of their\nfood intake there seems to be enough dat\non that but whether or not people choose\nto be vegan and eat a lot of plants or\ncarnivore and eat just meat you know\nwe've essentially stepped out of that\ndebate because um let's just say it's as\nfutile as um about any other debate\nyou're just never going to it's it's\ncompletely circular you end up right\nback in Twitter yeah and I think that um\nI mean when it comes to something like\nthis I don't I I've not seen any\ncompelling evidence for it so I can't I\ncertainly wouldn't say that it's a a\ntypical side effect that men would\nexperience is like developing breast\ntissue in response to Canabis I feel\nlike if that was the case it would be\nvery known in the scientific Community\nas something that comes out so this\nseems to be something that um Ur\npurportedly occurs on a backdrop of\nelevated androgens meaning in puberty or\na backdrop of some other um form of\nAndrogen incre like someone who's on\nsteroid yeah that's not the community\nI'm referring to it seems that um\nbecause transient um gomasa during\npuberty is actually fairly common um\nbecause of there's just so much Androgen\nbeing produced in puberty that some gets\naromatized and that um the the idea I'm\nnot saying stating this as fact is that\nit may exacerbate that in any case it\nsounds like the takeaway from this is\nthat there aren't a lot of conclusive\nstudies about the effects of cannabis on\ntestosterone or estrogen or\naromatization in any direction I I don't\nI mean I'd say like yeah this enough\nstudies that suggest that you might see\ntransient drops in testosterone from\nCannabis and it seems to be relatively\nshortlived um it doesn't seem but again\na lot of these studies also find that\nthe basil testosterone is already kind\nof high to begin with so staying in a\nnormal dynamic range it is again it's\nhomeostatic just like just like the\nendoc canabo yeah so and that's the\nthing I mean testosterone fluctuates\nacross the day anyway so there already I\nmean there's other things that fluctuate\nit's like cortisol these hormones have\nCycles so as long as you're in this\nnormal range there really shouldn't be\nany kind of like behavioral like in\nterms of sex drive for testosterone or\nlike\nphysiological like gyom or some change\nin I mean now there are potentially\neffects of THC directly on the testes\nthat could affect sperm that could\nhappen independent of changes in\ntestosterone are those positive or\nnegative changes I'm I'm assuming that\nthey the studies you referring to saw um\ndisrupted what they call sperm quality\nwhich has to do with motility Etc yeah I\nmean a lot of the uh kind of invitro\nstuff definitely would suggest that some\nof the animal stuff as well the human\nstuff is definitely a bit mixed I mean\nbut again if anything it would be like\nyeah could have some effect on sperm so\nI have like as we say this I'm just um\nchuckling to myself because anytime this\nconvers ation comes up about a substance\nand um sperm quality or egg quality I\nalways get a barrage of comments of\npeople telling me how many children they\nconceived while Under the Influence no\none is saying that you're going to be\ninfertile um but you know if people are\nhaving challenges of conceiving it might\nbe something to think about I would say\nthat I would agree on that so I would\nsay if someone was asking me this and\nthey were trying to get pregnant and\nstruggling I would say well definitely\ncut cannabis because some people may be\nmore impacted at by than others so for\nsome some you know various biological\nreasons that we don't have a biomarker\nfor there may be some men that use\ncannabis and it has a profound effect on\ntheir sperm quality their sperm capacit\nand so their ability to maintain\nfertility and for the bulk majority of\nman i' say that's probably not the case\nbut again if you're someone who is\nstruggling and you use cannabis male or\nfemale I would say cut that out and see\nif that has an effect for you along\nthose lines I saw it kind of a\njaw-dropping statistic and I I'm not\nsure I still believe it um um but you\ntell me what you know about this um\nwhich is that up to 15% of pregnant\nwomen in the US have used cannabis\nduring\npregnancy that just seems that number\njust seems too high and yet you know it\nexists out there yeah it's very I mean\nI've heard higher numbers lit no I've\nheard higher numbers than that as well\non the low end of this well I mean so\nI've heard as low as two and I've heard\nas high is 20 okay two sounds like okay\nI that I could imagine um but as high as\n20 and do we know what the effects on\nthe developing fetus are there's a lot\nto unpack there so first thing going\nback to the the the levels that's\nchallenging because again this depends\non are you talking about self-report or\nare you talking about verified blood\nlevels because those have varied so some\nof the higher numbers actually come from\nblood levels where they've taken blood\nsamples and found THC but the women have\nreported not using cannabis and so\nthey're the idea that it's like the\nself-report numbers tend to come in\naround two or three my guess is the real\nnumber is probably somewhere around 10%\nbut that also is going to vary depending\non what you're talking about because\nthere are a proportion of people who are\nusing cannabis and become pregnant and\nare unaware they're pregnant and are\nstill using cannabis and that would\nstill\nqualify under the way that it's defined\nthat someone used cannabis while\npregnant so the majority I would say the\noverwhelming majority of people once\nthey learn they're pregnant now that can\nbe all the way up to almost the end of\nthe first trimester typically stop using\ncannabis that seems to be the norm I\nwould say important point there yeah and\nI think also the number that carry on\nthrough the entire gational period is is\ngoing to be a lot less I would guess now\nthe motivations for this quite often are\nmore in the capacity of the kind of\nanti- nauseant um qualities that\ncannabis can have for some people and\nfor women struggling with morning\nsickness now anecdotally I have heard\nwomen say you know with the history of\nthings like thalidomide and Other\nantinauseant Drugs that had profound\nteratogenic effects on the fetuses women\nhave said that they would rather use\ncannabis than one of these other\ncompounds because they're less concerned\nabout the impacts of cannabis than they\nare because of the you know the theide\neffects that happened and theide effects\nare um malformation of the limbs and and\nother uh bodily structures in fetuses it\nwas a absolute tragedy of medicine that\num this occurred and even even one\num birth but um yeah it's the reason why\nthalidomide is now I believe banned as a\nas a drug for use during pregnancy yeah\nI I would I actually have no idea but I\nwould imagine um I think it would be one\nof those hard things to sell given its\nhistory especially but so I think\nthere's a reticence of a lot of people\nto consider using Pharmaceuticals to\nregulate nausea because they're\nuncertain of the consequences of it and\nthey feel that cannabis may be safer now\nthat in itself could present some\nproblems um in terms of that thought\nprocess now there was also a study that\nI thought was\nlike some of these things just frustrate\nyou it's where they actually decided to\ncall this was done in Colorado where\nthey called dispensaries and just acted\nnaive and asked what their\nrecommendations were and it was\nsomething like 80 to 85% of them were\nactually recommending that people would\nuse cannabis to manage morning sickness\nand I thought that was like it's just\none of these disappointing things where\nyou're like why are you being so wildly\nirresponsible to kind of promote these\nthings and this is you're talking about\nthe irresponsible that the dispensaries\nwould say that or irresponsible that the\nstudy was carried out that way because\nit's a little bit of um entament you\nsaid it not me could be I mean I I mean\nyou can you can bulk at either side of\nthis I think it's I mean I\nhave a lot of frustration in general\nwith the information that bud tenders\nput out into the world is that what\nthey're called Bud tenders Bud tenders\nthat's kind of the colloquial term that\npeople will use for someone who sells\ncannabis at a dispensary we see this in\nCanada and I've heard this throughout\nthe states as\nwell I personally have been a huge\nadvocate for the fact that I think so\nyou know I worked uh in restaurants and\nbars and stuff when I was younger and\nfor me to serve alcohol I had to undergo\nI don't know if you do this in the\nstates in Canada you have to do like a\nit's like a weekend course essentially\ncalled like serving it right or some\nother terminology where you learn the\nbasics of alcohol harms blah blah blah\nhow to tell if someone's intoxicated\nwhen you have to cut them off all these\nthings that you have to do to be able to\nserve alcohol I I have no idea if this\nexists in the States but it it was a\nthing in Canada bartenders uh in the US\nput in the comments on YouTube do you\nhave to undergo training about alcohol\nto bartend anything even if it's just\nlike an online quiz but like so I my\nperspective is because um pre-\nlegalization at least in Canada there\nwas somewhat of I think of a misguided\nthought that people would leverage their\nPhysicians for knowledge about cannabis\nand what's become very apparent is that\nthe overwhelming majority of people talk\nto the people selling them the Cannabis\nand yet those people selling cannabis\ndon't need to have undergone any form of\neducation and so like this kind of kills\nme because we've worked very hard to try\nand create educational platforms that\nare like agnostic in terms of our\nposition on cannabis that are just based\non the science I'm an executive director\nof an organization called the Canadian\nConsortium for the investigation of\ncannabinoids the ccic and it's we've\ndone CME courses for Physicians to try\nand train them about cannabis because I\nthink it's important that Physicians\nunderstand this but\nI've tried suggesting that I think that\nanyone selling cannabis should\nundergo a course like this just so that\nthere's some consensus in the informed\nlevel that someone who comes in because\na lot of people going to buy cannabis\nare quite naive about it and they just I\nmean even when we're talking about\ndosing what we've talked about with\nEdibles or smoking or how people consume\nit like you need to have a reliable\nsource of information at the front line\nthat is able to relay that to people and\nit it becomes very frustrating to me\nthat that they have become the main\nsource of information that people go and\nI'm uncertain of what their level of\ntraining is you're certainly doing your\npart to provide the public education\nabout cannabis now so we all appreciate\nyour highly informed and and Broad\ndistribution of this information because\nthis is also an issue with psychedelics\nwhich currently don't have legal status\nin the US this is an ongoing process of\nwhether or not it will right now things\nare really on the teeter totter with\nMDMA where we await the decision from\nthe FDA but the early recommendation to\num to the FDA was to not approve MDMA as\na treatment for PTSD that's as of today\nin you know mid mid to late June 2024\nwe'll see what happens but this is also\nthe case for um ketamine uh which is has\nlegal status but many people are\naccessing ketamine not through a\nphysician but through online sources so\nwhat you're speaking to here is is a\nmuch larger issue um and uh I absolutely\nagree with you I mean I think most\npeople are probably not aware except by\nexperience positive or negative in some\ncases about the differences in blood\nconcentration as it relates to number of\ntokes versus concentration versus edible\nI me these are critical themes\nespecially for where we're going to go\nnext which is you know all the\ndiscussion about high THC and psychosis\nyeah yeah exactly so I think that I I I\njust wish I mean again even if this was\njust like an online course that wasn't\nthat much but at least had some\nconsensus of information that was the\nbasics about how to you know have\nconversations and I I mean some of the\nour our system at least is somewhat\nprovincially regulated so like you know\nour organization has worked with like\nthe Ontario group that deals with\ncannabis distribution the Ontario like\nthe OCS which is antario Cannabis stores\num and help to create some information\npamphlets and stuff again it's not the\nsame as a teaching course but at least\nit's like these little infographic stuff\nthat kind of like gives people rough\nbreakdowns of things and kind of gives\nyou a little bit of information about\ndosing and understanding things like\nespecially with something like Edibles\nhow long you should wait just stuff like\nthis like it sounds like the take- home\nmessage is uh proceed with caution go\nyou know low and slow I mean that's the\nyeah the don't don't ingest too much too\nquickly like really you know if one is\ngoing to explore this legally of course\num you know take a little bit wait take\na little bit wait um because otherwise\nyou're going to get the who was the\nreporter I think it was Morin D but I\nright you're gonna I don't know actually\nwhen I say that she still on the floor\nin a Colorado Hotel she may have\nrecovered reping from the floor in\nColorado um but\nlike it yeah it's it can become very\nfrustrating it's just the kind of lack\nof understanding that exists in this\nspace and so I think this is one of the\nreasons why we've really kind of tried\nto push the public health side of this a\nlot more and we have I mean there was um\nthe center for addiction of mental\nhealth in Canada which does a lot of the\norganization of these things they did\nkind of put together what I found to be\nreally useful which again could be\nleveraged in the states these are all\naccessible onlines it's called the lower\nrisk cannabis use guidelines they kind\nof tried to create a framework that is\nsimilar to how people have done stuff\nwith alcohol um that just kind of goes\nthrough and a lot of it is this low and\nslow approach but it's like obviously\nyou want no risk you abstain if you're\ngoing to use these are the different\nways to engage in harm reduction um you\nknow like obviously oral consumption has\nyou you avoid the issue of lung damage\nthat you could get from smoking um but\nthen you know with oral consumption you\nhave to be aware of dosing and timing\nand all these other considerations but\nwhat about vaping um Can people\nself-regulate their THC concentration in\nthe blood by vaping as well as they can\nby joint or bong or other form of depend\non exactly what you're vaping so in the\nstates I've noticed when people say\nvaping they almost exclusively refer to\nsome kind of oilbased product that's in\na pen so in those situations um that's\ngoing to really heavily depend on what\nthe concentration of THC in that product\nis now the other form of vaping that I\nthink is a little bit more common in\nCanada maybe is vaping of the plant\nmatter itself and so this is where they\nhave like a vaporizer device that heats\nthe Cannabis to a point that will ENT\nhit the lift point to vaporize THC in\nthe canid a big bag yeah yeah like a\nvolcano um yeah um but it doesn't create\nany plant combustion and so there are\nstudies that have been run on that that\nhave shown that you avoid the combustion\nbyproducts so people don't like exhale\ncarbon monoxide or these other things\nthat we know can be damaging um if\nthey're vaping plant matter that was\nactually somewhat approved as like a\nmedical device pre- legalization when\ncan cannabis in Canada was only under\nmedical\nauthorization um because of the reduced\nharm associated with vaporizing the\nplant matter versus smoking it um that\nis I would say a safe guideline for harm\nreduction that if you're going to try\nand avoid you know there's still going\nto be some issues that happen with\nvaporization of plant matter but it's\nnot the same as combustion so you avoid\nlike some of the other issues that come\nout when we're talking about um\noil-based Vapor Products or whatever\nthey're in they're usually in some kind\nof oilbased\nsolution um who knows I mean we don't\nhave the research on this like we just\ndon't know I mean we certainly know\nlike there had been some pretty big\nerrors of like the things that happened\nin the states like there was that\nproblem where all those people developed\num kind of I don't know popcorn lung or\nthat lung inflammation where several\npeople died from vaping products which\nseemed to be like a byproduct I believe\nof them adding like vitamin E acetate or\nsomething into the because again\neveryone just assumes it's a nerd but\nthen when it when it combusts through\nthe vaporization process it creates a\nmassive irritant on lung tissue and so\nthat was just you know again in my mind\nthis is a problem with a lack of a\nfederal um regulatory framework because\nstuff like this happens you you would\nnot see that on a federal landscape\nbecause you'd have to go through testing\nlike people it's kind of the Wild West\nyou get down here every state has its\nown rules people there's not really a\nlot of like regulation of things well if\nyou go overseas it's even more wild I\nmean then there's I mean then you have\nno idea what you're consuming anywhere I\nwould say just because outside I mean\nagain Netherlands is a little bit of a\ndifferent situation um they're not legal\nthey're decry alized I don't know how\nwell the regulation over there the\nproduct is you know we're going to be\ndoing episodes on stem cells and you\nknow you got people flying out of\ncountry do stem cell injections people\nwere getting them down in Florida who\nwent blind from the injections of stem\ncells into the eye in an attempt to save\nwhat little vision they already had\nprobably don't want to get me started on\nthat one um I I'm in total agreement\nwith you um by the way I want to make\nsure that I ask about psychosis and\nparanoia yeah um I've previously said\nand I was sort of I wasn't joking but I\nhave um observed um in my history that\nuh when people started to uh experience\nsome degree of anxiety or paranoia when\num smoking cannabis that sometimes the\nmessage they would receive back is to\ntake more to just adjust the the\nsubjective experience I think that's a\nterrible idea um terrible idea baffled\nthat you heard that I have no idea let's\nsay I did more than hear it um see I\nI've observed it I I cannot even\nunderstand that that is the strangest\nthing I've ever heard but okay yeah well\nusually the advice of of of people in\nterms of that was recreational drug\ntaking is um is rarely excellent\nadvice that's that's so I I mean I agree\nwith you on that point for sure that you\nshould not be consuming more if you're\nhaving a bad reaction to it because that\nwill just like Grease the wheels going\ndownhill for sure yeah um I also am\naware that there are some very\nhigh-profile papers that been published\nin the last really 5 years or so\npointing to potential increased risk for\npsychosis of lasting\nduration um even after the effects of\ncannabis have worn off in high THC\ncannabis users in particular high THC\ncannabis users that initiate that\ncannabis use young and this might be\npreferentially impacting males I I want\nto make clear that what I just said is\nnot a statement of absolute fact it's my\nunderstanding of the conclusions of\nthese papers um there are other\nconclusions in these papers also but\nthat particular conclusion seems to be\nimportant enough that they place it in\nthe abstract and it's reached major\npress headlines so I guess the simple\nquestion which probably doesn't have a\nsimple\nanswer is does THC cause psychosis so\nyeah there's not a simple answer to that\nand I think that also is a question over\nwhether you're talking about acute drug\ninduced psychotic episode versus the\ndevelopment of a chronic um psychotic\ndisease like schizophrenia so um the\nfirst arm of that is just can people\nacutely have a psychotic episode to THC\nor cannabis and the answer to that is\nyes it's not common I would say in terms\nof Adverse Events that happen with\npeople consuming cannabis it's on the\nrarer side um but it definitely can\nhappen so less than 5% of people that oh\nmuch less than that I mean certainly I\nmean it's if something like this was\nhappening at a regular frequency it\nwould be very well known what about\nanxiety attack yeah anxiet attack is I'd\nsay more of a standard indication that\nsomeone's kind of gone overboard like\nthat's not dosage overboard or does it\ncarry the same set and setting\nconsiderations that um you know\npsychedelics like psilocybin have uh\nboth so I think there's some contextual\ncomponent to it there was like I mean\nback in the 70s when they did more let's\nsay interesting studies there's one\nwhere basically they dosed people on THC\nand then had them undergo oral surgery\nwhich seems like in hindsight a very bad\nidea and I think virtually everyone in\nthat study had a panic attack like so it\nreally potentiated the stress of what\nthey were undergoing and had they been\ngiven that same dose in a different\nsetting I'm not sure it would have\nevoked that kind of response but there\nis definitely a dose effect to this in\nterms of like you know the kind of\nclassic lowd do aspects of like of THC\nor cannabis like that are usually\nconsidered more the positive pleasurable\nresponses that are why people use like\nit reduces anxiety it relaxes blah blah\nblah\num that is more of like a low to\nnormal-ish dose let's say of what\nsomeone consumes to produce those\nresponses if they start going upwards\nthough it's not like it's graded it's\nlike a full flip like it's not linear at\nall it's almost like it goes in the\nopposite direction so you know someone\ncan use cannabis to reduce anxiety but\nthen cannabis can also trigger anxiety\nin other people and even in the same\nperson if they consume too much and a\nlot of this at least we think has to do\nwith the ability of it to regulate both\nexcitatory neurotrans and inhibitory and\nso for reasons that we don't totally\nunderstand there's like way more\ncannaboid receptors on inhibitory\nneurons than there is on excitatory\nneurons but in the early days of\ncreating the genetic lines um gavan\nMarano and beat Luts over in Europe\ncreated um like deletion of CB1 only\nfrom excitatory neurons or only from\ninhibitory neurons okay so to just\nclarify for people these are um\nlaboratory mice that are genetically\nmodified so that they contain or lack\nspecific\nreceptors on particular neuron type so\nthat researchers can parse the effects\nof THC on what we're referring to as\ninhibitory neurons which quiet other\nneurons versus excitatory neurons which\nexcite other neurons and so forth and in\ndoing so to understand some of the\nnetwork biology um which is basically\nimpossible to do in a typical Mouse\nwhat's called a wild type Mouse um or a\nhuman um because when one ingests the\ndrug or when the mouse is given the drug\nit affects any site in the brain\npotentially any site in the brain where\nthe CB1 expressor recept do like a full\nbody deletion of CB1 and you give a\nmouse THC doesn't respond to it at all\nnot surprisingly that's a comforting\nexperiment you want to see that result\nyeah exactly so that's how we know CB1\ndrives all the kind of psychoactive\neffects of THC so if you delete CB1 off\nof inhibitory gaban neurons even though\nthat removes like 70% of the neuro of\nthe CB1 receptors in the brain those\nanimals look just like wild they still\nget like they still exhibit all the\nclassic signs of intoxication in terms\nof how that would respond to like pain\nsensitivity or Locomotion or these other\nlike assays we use in mice to tell if\nthey're high if you delete the CB1 only\noff of excitatory neurons the glutamate\nneurons then you see um what looks like\nthe full knockout so now the animals\ndon't seem to get high so even though\nthe majority of CB1 receptors seem to be\non these inhibitory gabin neurons it's\nthe CB1 on the glutamatergic exy neurons\nthat mediate most of the classic signs\nof what we would consider intoxication\nfrom THC or cannabis but what's\ninteresting is um uh bat worked with the\nSpanish group 10 12 years ago then they\nshowed they're looking at anxiety that\nif you delete CB1 only off of excitatory\nneurons you lose the anti-anxiety\nangiolytic effects of THC but you still\nhave the you know panicky angiogenic\neffects of hos if you delete CB1 off of\nonly the inhibit at gaban neurons you\nstill have the lowd do anti-anxiety\neffect but now you don't have the high\ndo angiogenic panicky effect so what\nthat was suggesting was that for some\nreason CB1 like THC will initially hit\nCB1 on kind of glutamatergic neurons and\nessentially the thought is this will\nreduce excitatory transmission and\nprobably quiet down circuits and if\nwe're talking about something like the\namydala this is probably how it's\nreducing anxiety whereas as dosing\nstarts to increase and you start to\nsaturate the CB1 on the gabin neurons\nand turn off inhibition then the network\neffect is more of an amplification and\nthat seems to result in the development\nof kind of an angiogenic uh pro- anxiety\nresponse that's obviously\nundesirable why there's this\ndifferential shift it's not exactly\nclear I mean it's probably either due to\nsome of the like biology of exactly\nwhere the CB1 receptors sit uh on\nexcitatory or inhibitory neurons\nrelative to all the Machinery that\nregulates transmitter release I mean bat\nloots has definitely done some stuff\nlooking at the ability of uh cannaboid\nreceptors to evoke signaling responses\nin a cell and on glutamate neurons\nthey're much more sensitive than they\nare in gabin neurons so there's probably\na dose threshold so it does look like\nthis kind of you know low dosing what\nmost people are trying to achieve I\nwould assume when they consume cannabis\nis probably these effects mediated by\nquieting down excitatory transmission\nand then the adverse effects when\nsomeone consumes too much and they have\na negative response that's probably due\nto the the higher starting to saturate\non the inhibitory neurons now we\nobviously can never test something like\nthat in humans because we can't know but\nbased on what we've seen in animals\nthat's my theory of kind of how this is\nworking and why we see these kind of\nclassic biphasic effects so yeah too\nmuch THC not a good thing because then\nyou start maybe disinhibiting things\nlike the amigdala producing these kind\nof panicky angiogenic like outcomes on\nthat scale though I mean paranoia\nobviously that's a hard I don't know how\nyou study that in a rodent I mean that's\njust a strange thing so but I mean\nthat's kind of the precedent of when you\nstart going into the psychosis because\nobviously paranoia would be a big\ncomponent of that um someone once asked\nme a question about you you know have\nyou know what happens in the brain um\nlike Imaging wise when someone's having\nlike a psychotic episode from Cannabis\nand I was kind of thinking like how\nwould that study get done like probably\non accident because somebody takes\ncannabis is in the scanner and then\nstarts having a psychotic episode but\nchances are they're going to try and get\nfor those that don't know these I don't\nwant to scare people out of doing MRI or\nfmri but you know you're typically told\nto stay extremely still there's\nsometimes even a bite bar you know like\nthis is a very controlled environment\nnot not an environment that you would\nwant to be in during a psychotic episode\nno I can't actually even imagine how\nthat would go down so I'm like we this\nis something I don't think we're ever\ngoing to have an answer to because I\ndon't see I don't think you can actually\never test it but in terms of people\nhaving this kind of psychotic response\nit is pretty rare I mean and I say this\nbecause I can think of Canada kind of\nwhenever it's happened and someone has\nactually done something wildly\nunpredictable because they've had a\npsychotic response to cannabis it tends\nto make headlines so it's not it's not\ncommon I I could not give you an actual\nnumber but it's it's certainly not a\nfrequent thing because we would hear\nabout this a lot more if we did and\nthere's also the issue of\npolypharmacology which is simply when\npeople take one drug then there's often\nthe tendency to take another drug either\nbecause it's available in those\nconditions or because they threshold to\nsay yes is a little bit lower um do most\npeople who take cannabis and achieve the\nthe High um have a tendency to do other\ndrugs it doesn't seem like a drug that\npeople combine with a lot of other drugs\num I wouldn't say part I mean there's\ncertainly cannabis is used in tandem\nwith other drugs alcohol psychedelics at\ntimes for sure but that being said um I\nmean it's I there are is clearly a\npopulation of people that use cannabis\nas their only drug that they use I don't\nthink that's that uncommon um but in the\ncontext of the psychosis stuff I would\ndefinitely say sure you know if someone\nmixed it with amphetamine or something\nyou could have a very unpredictable\nrespons there but I mean I think the\npsychotic responses that have been\ndocumented are usually purely due to\ncannabis like it's not it's not\nnecessarily due to some kind of uh drug\ninteraction there there is something\nabout the way that cannabis is changing\nthe way the brain functions in a way\nthat for people who seem to be prone to\nthis they can have a psychotic response\nI again I don't think it's a very\ntypical thing but talking about what\nthat means in the context of like an\nactual disorder like a chronic disorder\nlike schizophrenia which is\ncharacterized by psychosis I think we're\ntalking about a whole different ball\ngame here and this is an area that\nis I mean I think it's an important\nthing to discuss in the context of\nscience\nbecause you can't establish causality\nlike in my view it's it's virtually\nimpossible because there's just no way\nto control all the variables that play\ninto this what we can say definitively\nis individual\nwho have schizophrenia first of all they\nuse cannabis at a higher rate than the\ngeneral population that's very clear\nyeah they definitely use cannabis at a\nhigher rate than the general\npopulation there is definitely a\nrelationship between um using cannabis\nand having the uh initiation of the\ndevelopment of schizophrenia uh and this\nis where a lot of the statistics that\nhave uh been used to develop the risk\nassessment essentially like so that you\nhave a greater risk if you know like you\nwere saying if you've used cannabis as a\nteenager use high potency as a lot of\nthe research has shown though they've\ndone these studies and they say it\nrelates to um a greater risk of\nschizophrenia\nessentially this is just a statistical\nAssociation that they found that people\nwho use cannabis the conversion into\nschizophrenia happens at a higher rate\nand there's more people with\nschizophrenia who are using cannabis is\nthere a bias towards uh males developing\npsychosis I know there may be a bias\ninitially toward males in schizophrenia\nthat could confound this so we want to\nbe careful to be honest in all the\nresearch I've and all the literature\nI've read on this I don't ever remember\nthere being clear sex descriptions of\nthe differences of males and females I\nmean again historically cannabis was\nmore used by males than females so that\ncould lean towards any bias that may be\nout there in the media the popular um\nlike just in general that people talk\nabout I can't think of any study that\nI've ever read that explicitly said this\nwas you know male biased per se they\nusually just report numbers or\nproportions of people\num the the issue is so yes there's this\nrelationship that exists and yes we know\nthat um cannabis can trigger psychotic\nepisodes so if there's an individual who\nhas schizophrenia we know for certain\nthat cannabis can lead to the onset of\nyou know uh increases in positive\nsymptoms like hallucinations and\ndelusions um and a full-blown psychotic\nepisode so I think the first thing to\nsay which is very clear is in my view if\nsomeone has schizophrenia cannabis is\ncontraindicated like you shouldn't be\nusing cannabis if you have schizophrenia\nI think that's a risk across the board\nwhat about a first relative who has\nschizophrenia because there's a strong\ngenetic component to schizophrenia so I\nwas going to say then the next question\nis um knowing who's going to develop\nschizophrenia obviously we don't know\nthis and as you say the only real\npredictive variable that we know of is a\nfirst-degree family member that has\nschizophrenia means that you have a\nhigher risk of developing schizophrenia\nso again uh same with bipolar I would\nsay if there's bipolar or SCH and a\nfamily to me those are the people who\nshould avoid cannabis um just in terms\nof the likelihood there's a much greater\nlikelihood that they'd have it would\nrelate to the onset of a disease or\ncould accelerate its its presentation in\nsome\ncapacity I think where things get really\ncomplicated um in this whole cannabis\nschizophrenia story is the causality and\nthere is a camp of people who have\nlooked at this literature and\ndefinitively believe that cannabis\ncauses schizophrenia um and they\nattribute a proportion of people who\nhave schizophrenia to only having that\nschizophrenia because of the fact that\nthey used cannabis um and I think You'\nhad some discussion about this in the\nlast podcast I can't remember exactly\nthe way that you described it yeah I was\num looking toward um some of the recent\nstudies in uh Lancet jamama Psychiatry I\nbelieve I we can provide links to these\nagain and now more recently there's been\na lot of um let's just call it\nmainstream media coverage of this\npotential yeah I think is the right way\nto refer to it potential linkage between\num adolescent teen and young adult use\nof high TC cannabis and Lasting\npsychosis but um the more I hear you\ntalk about this the more I'm wondering\nif that idea is being uh Amplified more\nthan than perhaps we ought to let it be\nAmplified I mean I think this is what\nhappens when you\nhave I mean obviously you're familiar\nwith this in science there's different\nsome things that we can be a little bit\nmore definitive about and then there's\nsome things that we just can't know for\ncertain it's just the way it is because\nof the way that we gather data and\nbecause of the way humans are and this\nisn't a question I believe we can ask\nfrom an animal model perspective in the\nsame capacity um so I don't think anyone\nwould deny at least anyone who's read\nthe literature that there's this\nrelationship between cannabis use\nespecially in adolescence in the\ndevelopment of schizophrenia now my\nperspective on this is and I'll explain\nwhy I have this perspective and how I\njustify it is to me cannabis is fuel on\na fire so if someone is prone to\ndeveloping schizophrenia adding cannabis\ninto the mix I think will make it kick\nin faster and harder so um if there is a\ngenetic vulnerability for for um\ndeveloping schizophrenia or some\nbiological predisposition that's there I\nwould say in that situation cannabis can\ntrigger an initial onset of the first\nepisode and it can make the prognosis of\nthe disease in the long term a lot worse\nlet's say as I recall and I may have\nthis incorrectly but as I recall from my\nundergraduate years what you just said\nis also true for military service for\npeople that have a predisposition to\ndevelop schizophrenia that active\nmilitary duty can exacerbate it as well\nI mean I've never heard that but that\nwould be a stressor and stressors are\nother ways I mean a lot of you know\nthere situations where uh IND I mean\nsome of it's the age but like you know\nfor example if someone is prone to\ndevelop schizophrenia they move away to\ncollege even that stressor can be\nsomething that brings on an episode but\ncannabis\nvery specifically like different than\nany other drugs like alcohol or\ncigarettes as far as I understand it at\nleast the temporal relationship between\ncannabis use and the development of of a\nfirst episode can be pretty linked um\nbut the arguments that I've always had\nwith people in this area who are very\ndefinitive on their end of the spectrum\nthat this is a causal relationship\nis first of all um we have a few things\nthat like I would leverage as kind of\nreal world evidence that makes this\nquestionable so the first one is like I\nwas saying earlier in the episode I mean\nwe really didn't have cannabis use in\nthe west like as a normal thing as one\nof the drugs that was part of the\nrepertoire of what people use\nrecreationally until like the 60s so\nunlike alcohol which has like been there\nfor centuries we have a little bit of a\nbefore and after what we can look at the\nGrateful Dead yeah so um now granted we\ndon't have like really good prevalence\ndata of what schizophrenia was in the\nera prior I mean even even nowadays our\nprevalence stat is not perfect but if\ncannabis as a solitary variable was\ndriving the Genesis of schizophrenia\ndenovo in the absence of any kind of\nbiological predisposition or genetic\npredisposition I find it very hard to\nbelieve that we wouldn't have seen a\nshift in the prevalence of the disease\nas cannabis became more mainstream and\nmore widely used and generally\nschizophrenia rates have remained\nlargely stable people can make arguments\nabout that better care other things that\nto challenge that argument sure so\nanother modern perspective would be okay\nwell let's look at Canada and the states\nlet's say where we have as I said\nearlier teenagers in Canada and the\nstates by grade 12 35 to 40% of\nteenagers have at least used cannabis\nsomewhat sporadically and somewhere\naround 5% is are probably using almost\ndaily so we have a concentrated group of\nwhat would be the high-risk population\nhere that are using at a pretty high\nrate and then we compare that to\nsomewhere like let's say Norway or\nSweden or any of the Scandinavian\ncountries where cannabis is like not a\nthing certainly not at a recreational\nlevel and not in teenagers and I mean\nthe rate use rates there are probably\nunder 5% globally for teenagers like\nprobably closer to two or 3% so you have\ntwo countries that have pretty similar\nsocial structures and other capacities\nof things we're both Western countries\nand yet our schizophrenia rates\nprevalence wise are relatively\ncomparable and yet in Canada and the\nstates our cannabis use rates in\nadolescence are wildly Amplified\ncompared to those countries so again if\nthis was causing schizophrenia to\ndevelop as a disease out of nowhere how\nwould that not track like how would that\nnot be seen when you just look at\nindividual variances across countries\nand prevalence rates yeah I I hear your\npoint loud and clear I seem to recall\nthat there is a higher incidence of\nschizophrenia independent of cannabis\nuse um closer to the polles you know and\nless so at the equator I don't know if\nthose statistics still hold up but I\nhave no idea yeah interesting for us to\nlook into that because then then it\nwould argue that you know since uh you\nknow we're comparing very Northern\nlocations to less Northern locations\nthat um perhaps cannabis was you know\nsort of exacerbating you probably use\nGreece or Italy I mean they going to\nhave cannabis use higher than\nScandinavian countries but it's going to\nbe way lower than North America still\nbecause it's just what is it about North\nAmericans and cannabis use I have no\nidea I mean I think it's just part of\nthe culture here it's just evolved\ntotally differently I mean Grateful Dead\nno I'm not picking on the Grateful Dead\nI like the Grateful Dead Rick Rubin\nconvinced me to start listening to them\nagain and uh cuz my sister used to\nlisten to them and there're some great\nsongs and they're from Meno Park pal\nAlto so I've done I've done uh my duty\nto listen they're some great songs so\nI'm not picking on them but but I mean\nlike you also have like in Europe though\nalcohol is also much more normal\nnormalized in general like kids will\ndrink it's not abnormal for kids who\nteenagers to drink alcohol is just much\nmore of a cultural thing as well and\nthere are just differences I mean it's\nthe same thing you look at like the\nopioid crisis that we're going through\nit's sure it's there to some degree in\nEurope but it's nothing like it is in\nNorth America we are just a different\nBeast for a lot of drug use do you see\ndifferences between United States and\nCanada with respect to either cannabis\nor opioid use I don't think dramatically\nI think we're pretty comparable from I\nmean for cannabis rates I would say\nthey're almost the same I I've not seen\nsure you might get some Regional\ndifferences like we I think Quebec has\nmuch lower rates of cannabis houst than\nsome other parts of Canada and you guys\nprobably in some Southern States maybe\nare a bit different than other states so\nI don't know about that but again\noverall at a federal level I think the\nwhich is where more of the most of the\ndata Aggregates I would say that they're\npretty comparable with each other so\nthey're not they're not wildly different\nat all and again even if you talk about\nclimate a lot of the US is a lot warmer\nthan Canada and you guys are certainly\ncloser to the Equator than we are so I I\nI mean we know like you do see higher\nrates of schizophrenia in urban settings\nthan you do in rural settings and so I\nme a stressor there's other you also\nhave more like there's just yeah there's\na lot of transitory populations that\ncome in and out of cities that you don't\nsee as much in rural communities there's\na lot more Mental Health Services\nthere's other variables that can\ninfluence that and no one's really I\nthink sused out a mechanism to explain\nwhy you see that but um so there are\nthere are things that shift across\nplaces but I don't think it has anything\nto do with the rates of cannabis use and\nI mean the other thing that became very\ninteresting in this whole debate over\nthe last 15 odd years that people have\nreally been talking about this a lot\nmore is the fact that there's also been\nseveral studies now that have done\ngenetics either at the the gws level or\njust even just looking at um polygenic\nrisk scores and there's at least three\npapers I can think of off the top of my\nhead that I could put the citations down\nfor for sure after this um that do look\nat this from an somewhat let's say\nunbiased perspective where they see you\nknow there's some there's certainly some\ngenetic architecture that relates to\npeople either initiating cannabis use or\npeople developing cannabis use disorder\nand there's clearly some genetic\narchitecture that relates to risk for\nschizophrenia uh and what these Studies\nhave found kind of across the three of\nthem was quite similar which was from\ntheir analysis the the directionality\nsuggested much more that having genetic\nrisk for schizophrenia predicted\ncannabis use more so than cannabis use\npredicted the development of\nschizophrenia interesting so what that\nwould mean is that there is some\nunderlying biology that might be shared\nbetween a biological vulnerability to\ndevelop schizophrenia and some factor\nthat relates to people using and or\nliking and or excessively using cannabis\nI've spoken to many psychiatrists in an\neffort to find someone expert in ADHD\nwe've done two episodes on ADHD focusing\non everything from behavioral to\nnutritional but also prescription drug\ntreatments for ADHD and what's\ninteresting is that all of them have\nrelayed the fact that many people not\njust young people but adults with ADHD\nwill often use not necessarily abuse but\nwill use stimulants like coffee and\nother forms of stimulants to a high\ndegree and then of course you can say\nwell perhaps the stimulants are causing\nADHD but they actually argue for the\nopposite which is that people are\nattempting to self-medicate and then\nit's perhaps no surprise that most not\nall but most of the medications that are\napproved for the treatment of ADHD are\nvariants of amphetamine or similar so it\nit's another case where you know\ndepending on whether or not you look\nthrough the lens of the drug leading to\nthe condition or the condition leading\nor through the lens of the condition\nleading to the the use of the drug you\ncan end up in um two very different\nplaces but it looks exactly the same um\nthrough each lens so to speak I think\nyou so I mean and this is you know I've\ndebated with other researchers in the\narea in print and in person about the\ndifferent interpretations of this and\none of the possibilities is again the\nthis idea of self-medication I mean\nindependent of there being some\nunderlying biological thing that just is\na third variable that explains the\nrelationship\nbetween cannabis and schizophrenia the\nother possibility is self-medication and\nthere there are some studies that\nsuggest this and others that don't\nsupport it um anecdotally from um having\ndone work in the community and talk to\nindividuals who have schizophrenia who\nuse cannabis what their perspective on\nis what I've heard from a few of them is\num you know the medications that they're\nprovided to manage the disease are\nrelatively effective at managing let's\nsay the positive symptoms like\nhallucinations delusions that aspect of\nthe disease is is somewhat well managed\nbut then there's another component which\nis the negative symptoms which is kind\nof like things that you know avolition I\ndon't like engaging in stuff um there's\nsome anxiety some depression some social\nwithdrawal and a lot of the medications\ndon't manage that component of the\ndisease and they have said that they\nfind Cannabis helps that side of it or\nit helps them de arouse a little bit\neven though a lot of them recognize it\nmay trigger the development of some of\nthe positive symptoms they feel that\nthey don't have any tool in there kit to\nmanage the negative symptoms and so it\ncould be in my mind when I look at that\nit could be a bit of a vicious cycle\nwhere someone's using it to kind of\nBand-Aid one aspect but making other\naspects of the disease worse at the same\ntime so it can get very complicated but\nso I mean there are various ways of\nlooking at this in terms of you know so\nit's either you could say there's a\ncausal argument which is made by many\nsaying cannabis causes schizophrenia and\ntherefore if we eradicated it um and I\nthink you had alluded to something like\nthat in the last podcast that if you\nremoved it would have this big effect in\nterms of reducing schizophrenia rates\nand that's similar to the argument that\na lot of the researchers in Britain have\nmade and I'm not personally convinced of\nthat and I say that simply because I\nlook at the data from Scandinavia and\nI'm like well there you have a\npopulation that barely uses any cannabis\nand yet their schizophrenia rates are\nthe same so the only way in my mind if I\nlook at this kind of scientifically from\na data perspective that cannabis could\nbe causing schizophrenia denovo in a\nsubset of people is that there must be\nan equal proportion of people for whom\nfor some reason and somehow cannabis is\npreventing them from developing\nschizophrenia so that it's a zero sum\ngame at the end of the day and there's\nno change in rates like I can't actually\nunderstand any other model that could\nexplain this yeah no I the way you\nyou're explaining it now makes perfect\nsense I do want to make sure that we\ndistinguish between um\nschizophrenia like psychosis or\nschizophrenia itself induced by cannabis\nyeah and manic bipolar um episode so\npeople who have a predisposition or\nfull-blown manic bipolar sometimes\ncalled manic depression but that's you\nknow there's a lot of nuance there we\ndid an episode about this um that people\ncan uh also find Linked In the show note\ncaptions but in any case is there any\nevidence for the fact that people who\nsuffer from or have a predisposition to\nmanic bipolar conditions like bipolar\ndepression for instance should avoid\nhigh THC cannabis\num so well first of all I mean for in\nlike hered ability family trees for\nexample where you look at something like\nbipolar schizophrenia the two do kind of\ntrack together sure so it's not I mean I\nthink it's hard to separate these in\nsome capacity because um you know I\nremember years ago at Society for\nNeuroscience Glen Close was one of the I\ndon't know if you were at that meeting\nbut Glen CL was one yeah she was one of\nthe public speakers and she had talked\nabout schizophrenia in her family tree\nand she kind of put up this family tree\nof like you know her family and the the\none uh the previous relatives in her\nfamily and showed like the individuals\nwho had schizophrenia and bipolar as\nwell and this is something I think\nthat's been seen a fair amount is um\nthere is some co-relationship in the way\nthat these track at a hered ability\nlevel and so I don't know that area\nreally well enough to to be able to\ncomment on and from the Cannabis\nperspective bipolar is definitely much\nless stud studied and focused on than\nschizophrenia is but I think also to the\ncomment about the high-thc thing I think\nthis is the other part of the argument\nthat's emerged out of this and this is\nthe other part where I see a lot of the\num causality arguments kind of crumble\nonto themselves to some degree and\nthere's been others who've made these\nvery similar arguments to what I'm\nmaking here which is um the push that\ncame out of this out of the UK at least\nwas much more that it's this High\npotency kind of skunk cannabis they\nreferred to which first of all was based\non a smell which they didn't really\nhadn't done a lot of analytics on so it\nwas people make the Assumption if it\nsmells stronger it's more potent\ncannabis that's not really true because\nTHC doesn't dictate the odor that's as I\nwas saying more of a tarpine thing but\ncertainly I'm sure some of the skunk\ncannabis they were referring to is high\npotency cannabis and so the analysis on\nthis if you actually go back to those\npapers and read is they often use like\nhash or low potency cannabis as their\ncontrol where they show no association\nwith cannabis and so that's what's use\nthis argument that it's the high potency\ncannabis that has driven this so now the\nproblem with this argument in my view\nagain I look for what is the um answer\nthat fits in with the data like what's\nthat's the most parsimonious explanation\nhere that everything can be explained by\nand so the problem with that argument is\nif you look at the Cannabis\nschizophrenia literature everything goes\nback to this one 1987 Lancet paper out\nof Sweden where in that paper they\nessentially looked at um they have\nreally detailed life records and health\nrecords and this was Swedish conscripts\nand they essentially found that if\nsomeone had used cannabis the rate the\nrisk of developing schizophrenia had\ngone up and up and so this was based on\na cohort of people when it was published\nin ' 87 that the data would have been\ncollected through like the 60s 7s early\n80s so we're talking about Sweden and\ncannabis it's not a country that has\nhigh cannabis use rates and an an arrow\nin cannabis was hovering in a 2 to five%\nTHC range that was the initial finding\nthat provided this association between\nit and yet the Cannabis in that study\nthat they would have been referring to\nwould have been incredibly low potency\ncompared to what has happened or like\nwhat it is today so if the argument is\nthat it's only related to high potency\nhow would that initial finding have ever\nbeen found because it doesn't make any\nsense whereas the alternate explanation\nthat others have put forward which I\nagree with and is far more sound is that\nthere is some biological reason why\nindividuals who either prone to develop\nor who have schizophrenia like cannabis\nand they will tend to seek out the\nhighest potency product they can get\naccess to so in the 7s in Sweden that\nwould have been 2 to 5% THC cannabis\nnowadays it's higher potency cannabis\nor maybe they seek out lots of different\nforms of recreational drugs and cannabis\njust happens to be one that they land on\nwhich raises the other question which is\nit's hard to imagine that these people\nwho develop psychosis who happen to be\nusing cannabis are only using cannabis\nit could be but I mean they also there's\nthere's no question there's a a lot of\nnicotine consumption I mean individuals\nwith schizophrenia use they smoke a lot\nof cigarettes I mean that's also much\nhigher than the general population rates\nwhich is known to stimulate dopic and\nand other pathway and there could be\nother reasons you know again there may\nbe some reason why they like it um and I\nthink this is something that I think we\njust don't understand it's a very\nchallenging thing to figure out why it\nis that individuals that have certain\ndiseases may like certain substances is\nit is it helping them I mean some people\nhave argued that perhaps nicotine for\nexample might enhance cognition in\nindividuals with SCH schizophrenia and\nthat may be why they like it I think it\nenhances cognition in everybody it just\ncarries certain health concerns and by\nthe way it doesn't enhance all forms of\ncognition but there there there is a\nnice body of work to support the idea\nthat nicotine delivered in any number of\ndifferent forms can improve cognitive\nfunction to some extent but I don't\nsuggest people run out and do it and in\nfact it's um one of the more um quickly\nuh uh abuse drugs nowadays because of\nthe non-smoking delivery routes that are\nbecoming really popular pouches and and\nthings in fact I was chewing a little\nbit of Nicorette gum to kind of do\nexperiment I liked it a lot and then um\nI decided to stop completely recently\nbecause it just um it wasn't having the\nsame effect and I found myself reaching\nfor more and that's the time when I\nusually back\nout well um yeah no nicotine's a whole\nother thing which I yeah uh we'll have\nyou back to talk about n no I would\ndefinitely don't not know enough about\nthat to have any kind of informed\nconversation but um so I don't know I I\nwould say it to me at the end of the day\nif I put all the data together what I\nwould kind of\nthe perspective that I have on this is\nfor some reason be it genetic\narchitecture biological predisposition\nindividuals who are prone to develop\nschizophrenia also seem to be prone to\nuse cannabis and use it at possibly at\nexcessive levels or possibly higher\npotency products they seek out um using\ncannabis if someone is prone to develop\nit may initiate or trigger the onset of\nthe disease um and I think in the long\nterm it will likely make the prognosis\nof the disease worse so\nif you were a psychiatrist in a clinic\nand you consistently see patients\npresenting saying I didn't have\npsychosis I used cannabis now I have\npsychosis and it converts into\nschizophrenia I can understand why the\nassociation would be made regularly that\nthere's kind of a domino effect here and\ncausality becomes attributed but I think\nwhen we take a step back and look at the\nlarger data in its kind of entirety to\nme it's a very tricky argument to make\nbecause there's a lot of things that you\njust can't explain from that perspective\nand this is also one of the things that\nI find absolutely bizarre about cannabis\nin general is uh it's a wildly\npolarizing topic of conversation and\npeople have incredibly Dee rooted\nopinions on both sides of the spectrum\nand for some reason if I don't say\ncannabis is the devil and causes disease\nthat means I'm an advocate and then on\nthe other side of the coin if I don't\nsay cannabis cures everything I'm a\nprohibitionist so like I'm in this fun\nposition where I get hate mail from both\nsides and everyone just generally\ndepending on their perspective thinks\nthat I have a bias kind of going in one\nway or the other and I'm very you know\nwant it this way or want it this way at\nthe end of the day I'm just like no I\njust like data so I'm like I'm going to\ntry and answer things as best as I can\nwith data and to me that's the\nperspective I've\nmaintained and I do think that like\nthese aren't trivial questions because\nwhen we went through the legalization\nprocess and Canada this was something\nthat came up again and again and again\nwas this association with schizophrenia\nand in the UK this is something that\ncomes up again and again and again\nbecause whenever there's any discussion\nabout the UK moving forward to\nlegalization these ideas come back and\nso the public health kind of consequence\nof this is not intangible and so for\npeople to be making these very strong\ncausality arguments and having this kind\nof um opinion that a lot of people just\ntake up I think can have a lot of\ninfluence and so that's why like there's\nliterally no reason I should have a dog\nin this fight I don't study\nschizophrenia in any capacity um and\nit's not my area of research but because\nI'm in the Cannabis field I always feel\nvery strongly that we need to maintain\nClarity over what the data says and not\nget caught in these opinion-based\narguments and I feel like this is one of\nthese areas that has just kind of the\namount of people I talk to that\nregularly tell me that they know that\ncannabis causes schizophrenia and\nthey're terrified if someone uses it cuz\nit's going\ncause them to become um schizophrenic I\nam just kind of shocked by so this has\nclearly permeated you know the general\npopulation that there's a widespread\nbelief of this yeah I think it's because\nof these uh very high-profile papers and\nthe way those were picked up by\ntraditional media um and this seems to\nbe something that every couple of years\nis's a Resurgence of this idea um\nclearly people are curious about it and\nso not I just want to say thank you for\nclarifying um what is now to me obvious\nthat it could be that there's a\nrelationship there um it's clearly not\nthe case yet and it may never be the\ncase that there's a causal relationship\nthere and it could just as well be that\npeople who have a predisposition to\nschizophrenia are seeking out cannabis\nuse and engaging in cannabis use and I\nthink that's a very important principle\nfor our listeners and viewers to just\nhear and understand anytime we're\ntalking about a substance and a\ncondition yeah and I mean I think again\nthis is again no endorsement that that\ndoesn't mean that it's safe and that\nthat's without harm I'm just strong of\nthe opinion that I don't think\nindividuals with schizophrenia who are\nor who have you know first deegree\nrelatives should use cannabis because I\nthink there's a high degree of risk\nthere but that's a very different\nargument than making saying cannabis\ncauses schizophrenia and if we remove it\nfrom society we'll see drops in rates of\nschizophrenia I don't believe there's\nany evidence that actually could support\nthat um so it's just a nuanced argument\nand this is a good thing about more of a\nlong form podcast is it allows for\nnuance so yeah\nabsolutely let's talk about strains of\ncannabis um I've spoken before uh about\nthe sativa versus the indicia strains\nand certainly there is a lot a lot a lot\nof subjective anecdotal descriptions\nabout differences in the quote unquote\neffects of those as reported by users um\nwhen I talked about this before um in\nthe Cannabis episode I leaned on a paper\nthat took those subjective reports of\narguably many many people um push those\nsubjective reports through what was\nknown about the strains they claimed to\nhave used so this is you know people are\nreporting their use we assume honestly\nbut you always have to assume that they\nI guess people could be lying about\nwhich strains or misinformed but and\nthen using machine learning to couple\ntheir subjective experiences as they\nreport them to indicia versus Sativa\nstrains and then by looking at the\nchemical composition of those different\nproducts because these were products\nthat they had consumed trying to attack\nchemical composition to to strain in\nthis case the mainly the Inda sativa\ndiscrepancy to subjective experience and\nI know that you and presumably others in\nthe field of cannabis research take real\nissue to that sort of approach and\nperhaps I have the the feeling this is\nwhat you're going to say\num rest on the idea that we at least at\nthis point in time really can't say\nanything about the different biological\neffects of sativas versus indicas and\nyet at the beginning of the episode you\nsaid that there are many many different\ncannabinoid compounds in cannabis so\nthree questions and I'll keep these um\nvery short one um do you think that\nthere are different subjective effects\nof different strains of cannabis that\ncan be attributed to the different\nstrains right not just to individual\ndifferences in experience and then the\nsecond is do you think that there will\never be a time in which we can\nunderstand this plan\nflower right to the extent that we can\nengineer it to provide specific\nsubjective experiences perhaps more\npositive than negative Etc and then\nthere's a third question but I'll hold\noff okay so um yes so going back to uh\njust the idea with the Indica sativa\nthing so the Inda\nsativa names at least from everything\nI've understood from everyone that I\ntalk to and being in this field is it's\nthose are are Botanical terms that\nlargely refer to shape of the plant the\nyou know the way the bud grows blah blah\nblah they do not track with chemical\ncomposition in any way um in fact Nick\njacomas has done like a lot of analysis\nof like thousands and thousands of\ndifferent kinds of canab cannabis that\nhave been submitted for kind of um\nbiochemical analysis to understand THC\nCBD Tarpin minor canabo content and\nessentially um his his work as well as\nfrom all the people that have done the\ngenetics on this\nis the variability that exists within\nwhat someone calls an indicia or a\nsativa is uh greater than the\nvariability that there is between them\nand there's no there is no such thing as\na chemical profile that exists in\nsomething that's a sativa versus\nsomething that's an Indica is it\npossible that there's a chemical profile\nthat relates to the most common indicas\nor most common sativas I mean I think in\nNick's analysis there was like a couple\nof tpin that may have loaded on a little\nbit onto things that were sativas but\nthere was tons of sativas that didn't\nfall into that bracket okay well then\nthat immediately to me uh negates the\nsort of premise of this paper that I was\nreferring to that divides according to\nindicia sativa and yet the paper is also\ntrying to distinguish among all the\ndifferent types or products of cannabis\nmeaning is there some other feature of\nthe cannabis plant that does relate to\nthese different subjective effects\nbecause people do seem to get different\nsubjective effects from different\nproducts that relate in some way to\nthings other than the concentration of\nTHC yeah I would my honest opinion is\nthis is expectancy bias this is all\nexpectancy bias I mean I see so they\npurchase something that they think is\ngoing to make them calm and it makes\nthem feel calm if 20 people tell you\nthat taking this makes you calm you\ncannot remove your expectation bias from\nthe fact that when you consume it you\nfeel calm like and this has been I think\none of the most common things with with\ncannabis is like this whole area is so\nripe with these expectancy biases that\npeople have about what they assume if\nyou go someone goes into you know and a\nbud tender tells them this is a sativa\nit's going to energize you there's no\nway to remove that expectancy bias from\nfrom what you get and I mean like from\ntalking to a lot of people that kind of\nstudy this more explicitly they always\nsay the biggest predictor of what\nsomeone feels when they consume cannabis\nis what they're told on the label it's\ngoing to do to them I mean and a lot\nwild it speaks to you know I did an\nepisode on the placebo effect and a lot\nof people hear placebo effect and they\ngo okay well then everything's a place\nplacebo effect is amazing there's dose\nresponse to the placebo effect of\nnicotine on cognition dose response if\nyou're told you got a high dose when you\nactually got a low dose you will exhibit\nthe high do neurocognitive enhancement\neffect and by brain Imaging it shows a\nhigh do like enhancement of the relevant\nbrain areas in other words the\nexpectancy drives changes in brain\nactivity across the board I mean it's\nagain this is not unique to cannabis in\nany way it's just cannabis is so ripe\nfor this because of the like myth like\nthe lore that it just exists like people\nsay this I mean the issue has\nbeen uh and I just asked Ryan Vander\nthis as far as I know I don't believe\nthere's actually ever been a clinical\ntrial that has blinded people and given\nthem sativas or indicas and actually had\nthem predict what they are or been able\nto characterize any kind of phenotypic\ndescription of what that intoxicated\nState feels like\nand because all the like the paper that\nyou were referring to where it was users\nwho had got the product they can't\nremove their own inherent biases from\ntheir own experience it's it's going to\nit's going to influence it there's no\nway around it and\nso people kind of lean into this and I\nprobably not consciously but they I mean\nthe amount of people I've talked to that\nreally genuinely believe this to their\ncore that sativa does this and Inda does\nthis is fascinating to me because again\nlike you have these two like THC is what\ndrives the high that's very clear and\nyou can take a sativa and Inda that have\nvirtually identical levels of THC and\nyet people will report very different\nintoxicating states that come out of\nthat do you think this also explains the\num lore or perhaps it's real that\ndifferent alcohols produce different\ndrunks um you know I mean I've heard of\nyou know i' I've got friends who will\nswear that whiskey makes them feel\naggressive and vodka you know is mellow\nand that white Tequilas feel different\nthan than the other Tequilas and you\nknow for people listening to this they\ngo okay well that's not science I agree\nthat's not science that's just anecdote\nyeah and yet um you know the chemical\ncomposition of these different drinks is\ndifferent but ultimately we're talking\nabout alcohol right different sugar\ncontents you know different hangover\npropensity I mean I have to believe the\nmajority of that's an expectancy bias I\nhave a hard time believe that these\nthings are really driven by fundamental\nbiological differences within because\nanything else that's I mean that's the\nthing like sure some of the labs now\nthere is a movement to start looking at\ncan certain compositions of other things\nin cannabis start to maybe modulate or\ninfluence this is called like I think\nI've said this before the Entourage\neffect this idea that THC alone might do\none thing but then layering in other\ntpin or minor cannaboids May influence\nthat effect that is a theory that's not\na thing that we know definitively in any\nway in fact there's virtually no\nresearch that's ever been done to test\nthis there's some stuff that's starting\nto come out now like Ryan vandry at\nHopkins recently published a paper where\nthey kind of in a dose dependent manner\nadded lemon which is one of these Tarpin\nlike I said I think gives it like a\ncitrusy odor into the THC and did find\nthat a really high dose probably a dose\nthat I don't think you could actually\nfind in cannabis it's a little bit\nhigher than what you would have gotten\nthere but lemine did seem to be able to\ncurb the ability of high do THC to make\nsomeone feel anxious and this was was\ndone in a blinded manner so um there's I\nthink some validity to the interaction\nwhether that's occurring in cannabis\nnaturally because of the levels of THC\ntoonine I don't know but it really was\none of the first demonstrations that\nadding in a tarpine could actually\ninfluence a a component of the\nintoxicated state in a in a blinded\nmanner I think is interesting and Zea\nCooper who's here at UCLA is doing some\nwork with beta caropine which is\nprobably probably the second most\nabundant tpine I think from Nick jom's\nwork I think mercine may have been the\nhighest prevalent tpine across all types\nof cannabis beta carry offl is probably\nthe second and limine I think is\nprobably the third um\nand so I think they I mean and so\nthey're looking at I think Zea's work is\nin the context of pain so they're trying\nto look at if a fixed dose of THC if you\nadd in varying levels of beta carry\nofflane does this influence this so\nbecause again you do see this in patient\ncommunities where they say well this\nstrain helps my pain better than that\nstrain and so it's like okay is there\nactual legitimacy to this or again is\nthis just an expectancy bias because\nsomeone who sold this to you told you\nthat this strain is better for pain and\nthe problem is these are all subjective\nendpoints I mean this is like pain sleep\nanxiety these are all it's how someone\npersonally experiences it we know from\nall the clinical trials that study pain\nsleep and anxiety there's massive\nPlacebo effects that happen in all these\nconditions and so it's very difficult to\nactually make any kind of sound\nstatements about this in the absence of\nthere being kind of clinical trials that\nhave clearly started to do this but it's\nlike as you can imagine when you start\ndoing the math given the amount of\nTurpin and the amount of combinations of\ndifferent levels how overwhelming this\ncould become because maybe you know\nthere's a few that you need in there\nthat interact with THC not just one\nthere is like a lot of work that's\nhappened in the last few years that has\nreally started to try and look at if\nthese tpin or minor cannaboids act at\nthe cannaboid receptor which none of\nthem seem to so this isn't like you've\ngot things that modulate how THC is\nbinding to CB1 if they're doing\nsomething else it's probably through an\ninteraction with another neurochemical\nsystem that's influencing what THC is\ndoing so I'm not against the idea that\nlike different chemovar or what people\ncall strains of cannabis could do\ndifferent things\nsubjectively I just am remiss to believe\nthis until I see some blinded data\nbecause I think outside of that we know\nhow powerful an expectancy bias is so it\nmakes it very very challenging to make\nany kind of firm statements and so kind\nof in the context of like how you\nintroduced this that was again I think\nlike one of the issues that I took with\nthe other podcast was because as you've\nsaid I understand the thought process\nyou went through like you you know you\nhad this paper where people were\nreporting subjective effects there's\nsome neuroimaging data that's been done\nwith cannabis so you kind of said okay\nthis is what that was and that was what\nsativa did and versus this is what\nIndica did um so I think it's important\nthat you explain that because I do think\nthat like well that's how that's what\nthe data pointed to but now what I'm\nrealizing is that anytime we're talking\nabout cannabis because of the 70 plus\ncannabinoids present that could modify\nor join uh so work in parallel with the\neffects of THC we're really talking\nabout polypharmacology it's not a pure\nsub it's not like giving anandamide or\nor it's not like you know adjusting\nlevels of indis and anide you know this\nraises I think an equally important\nissue for us to resolve which is um CBD\nwhich we didn't talk about earlier when\num Nolan Williams who's a psychiat he's\nhe's one of these phenom triple board\ncertified Psychiatry neurology um\ncolleague of mine from Stanford School\nof Medicine who mainly works on ibigan\nand transcranial magnetic stimulation\nbut we talked about uh cannabis a bit\nwhen he was on the podcast and he\nmentioned a strain of cannabis that is\navailable in Colorado which is pure\nCBD I think it's called Charlotte's Web\num and the parents\nof children who have epilepsy MH will\nmove there or there just to get this\nstrain because it seems to help their\nepileptic seizure I mean I would say\nthat's definitely not true nowadays that\npre- legalization anywhere outside of\nColorado that was true people were were\ngravitating there towards it yeah so the\nquestions are um could you tell us a\nlittle bit about the biology of the CBD\nreceptor um mainly as it relates to CB1\nor not you know does it bind CB1 as well\num if not um how is it working and you\nmentioned that people will not report\nany subjective effect of taking a pure\nCBD compound so lacking THC but it\nsounds like it may have some usefulness\nfor uh treatment of epilepsy and what\nare some other established meaning\nclinical trials and or lab um data to\nsupport the use of CBD for any type of\neither um you know psychiatric condition\npain Etc so I mean the first thing\nthat's interesting that I think a lot of\npeople don't understand about CBD is CBD\nlike doesn't really exist in any form of\nStreet cannabis and it hasn't for a very\nlong time you meaning there's no CBD in\nthere there's some there's very very low\nlevels of CBD and the reason that is is\nbecause THC and CBD are both made from\nthe same precursor molecule and which\ndirection it goes in is based purely on\nwhich synthetic enzyme converts it to\neither THC or CBD and so as people have\nclearly chased THC and wanted cannabis\nthat's rich in THC and so cannabis has\nbeen bred to become higher content in\nTHC by default CBD has been bred out of\nthe plant and it has largely been bred\nout of the plant for quite some time uh\nand so this I I always find it\ninteresting that there's this community\nthat's like oh well THC is the\nrecreational cannabis and CBD is the\nmedical cannabis and I'm always like\nthat's bizarre because historically\nthere's always been like THC has been\nwhat people have bred cannabis for and\nso kind of any medical benefits that\npeople have reported from Cannabis per\nse usually are THC and CB1 driven CBD is\nthis other molecule that we can go to\nthe pharmacology in a second but again\nit's just it's I mean I think in the in\nthe analysis that Nick jomas did of all\nthese strains and types of cannabis that\nexist uh in the United States when they\nwent through their thing of thousands\nand thousands of kinds of cannabis it\nwas like 3% of them maybe had like more\nthan 1% CBD like it's very low like\nthere's almost none and in Canada to get\na CBD Rich strain you have to basically\nexplicitly buy it because it has to be\nbred to make CBD and so this is the kind\nof choar Distinction I think you did\nallude to this last time which is the\ntype one type two type three so type one\nis high THC type two is like somewhat\nbalanced and type three is high CBD and\nnow I think like 90 to 90 something low\npercent of all cannabis that are out\nthere are type one like they're all high\nTHC because that's what's been bred\nthere's a few that have been mixed um\nand so are kind of equal proportions but\nyou're never going to get high equal\nproportions so like a high THC cannabis\nis like 20 to 30% if you go for Ty two\nwhich is mixed they're both going to\nfall around\n12% uh maybe a little more but in that\nrange and then same if you got a type\nthree it's high CBD it's going to be\n20ish per CBD and very low THC and so no\none has ever kind of grown CBD Rich\ncannabis outside of this recent boom in\nthe last decade that's happened about\npeople wanting CBD because of the\ncharlott's web which was popularized by\nuh I think sanj Gupta on CNN in like\n2012 or something it was a while ago but\nthat was what got a huge movement going\naround this idea of CBD and yeah so the\ncharlott's web was I I believe that was\nwhat they had named that kind of\ncannabis that they had extracted it from\nand so it was this it was a tincture\nthat they were using that was very high\nCBD content that they were finding was\ncontrolling um pediatric seizures and\nkids now this has actually been studied\npretty effectively uh most of it's come\nout of Boston um Elizabeth\nteal um has been one of the main leads\non this and she's a neurologist there\nthat has done a lot of the work on this\nand so they have I think very clearly\nand the data is incredibly compelling\ntheir research is one of the reasons why\nCBD has been descheduled or changed in\nits scheduling down to a u what is it\nfive what is it class like CBD yeah like\nCBD CBD I mean given the uh availability\nof CBD everywhere in gummies and drinks\nand I mean you can get it in a\nconvenience story so it's been kind of a\nlot of it's been like shifted in its\nclassification status um because it\nactually has been shown very clearly to\nhave medical benefit and so in and it\nwas very specific it was a very specific\nform of pediatric epilepsy called D\nsyndrome now I there's other forms of uh\npediatric epilepsy I know Elizabeth has\nstudied in addition that has found\ncomparable levels of efficacy but\nessentially what they have shown is that\nlike very high doses of CBD uh are\nrelatively effective at um calming down\nthe seizures in some kids it's profound\nlike in some kids talking about kids\nthat were having dozens of seizures a\nday to essentially none and so um and I\ncan understand I mean that's super impr\nfrom a Grassroots perspective I can\nunderstand if you were a parent who had\na child with a disease like this that\nwas largely intractable and not that\nwell controlled from the medications\nthey on and then something came around\nthat showed this level of efficacy you\nwould gravitate towards it like that\nmakes sense to me and I think the work\nthat Elizabeth and her colleagues have\ndone has been really important to\nestablish the efficacy of this of CBD in\nthese in these um disease States and so\nI don't think at this point there's a\nlot of controversy around that the\nquestion that comes out though is so how\nis it working and we don't have a\nmechanism so as you said like CBD\nreceptor there is no CB like there's no\nreceptor that CBD binds to I was under\nthe impression that CBD also bound to\nthe CB1\nreceptor no I I mean certainly or that\nit or that under some conditions it can\nmodulate the shape of the receptor to\nadjust THC binding but now you're\ntelling me that these two things rarely\ncoexist together so I guess the question\nyou can dose them like you can certainly\nI mean you can have products that are\nmade that are like oilbased products at\nleast that have a certain amount of CBD\nand a certain amount of THC and people\ndo go for those and there's this I mean\none of the arguments people make is they\nsay oh introducing CBD reduces the\nadverse effects of THC I'm like well if\nyou're using it in a strain that's\nsimply because the strin of cannabis has\nless THC now so you bread it out but I\nmean like a lot of this was based on\nsome that came out a long time ago from\nBrazil where they showed that like um\ngiving CBD with a relatively high dose\nof THC could curb some anxiety that came\nout from hios THC I thought the\nexplanation for that was that c CBD can\nmodify the CB1 receptor in some way that\nmakes THC less able to engage with the\nsome evidence to support that that like\nwe would call these aleric modulators\nthere's some evidence that suggests that\nCBD May interact with a aleric site on\nthe canono receptor that makes THC bind\nless doesn't sound like you're\nparticularly convinced by that evidence\nI think I mean like the look on your\nface for those listening I'm looking at\nMatt and he's I think he's he's being\ngenerous here let me ask you a little\ndifferently does anyone know what CBD\nbinds to no and so the most convincing\nthing that I've seen that CBD binds to\nis the work that CC Hillard has done\nlooking at its ability to um essentially\nblock adenosine uptake and so it can\ninhibit the adenosine transporter so it\ncauses people feel more alert no because\nyou're getting more adenosine so you get\nan accumulation it blocks the adeny\ntransport mechanism I see so you get an\naccumulation of adenosine which is more\nsedative um and that I mean in the pnas\npaper that um CC's lab had from 2006\nthey showed that that also mediated it\nwas the adenosine I think 2A receptor\nthat drove the um anti-inflammatory\neffects of CBD so it was a secondary\neffect by sort of the opposite of uh\ncaffeine of caffeine yeah I know if I\nremember the way you're describing this\nit sounds like the the anti- caffeine\nthat's kind of how I describe to people\nif they ever ask me for what the\npharmacology of CBD is I'm like that's\nnot the only mechanism but the thing\nthat was important in CC studies that I\nthink is relevant is that it was not\nsuper high concentrations of CBD that\ncaused that so you could get this\nadenosine accumulation at you know\nyou're not talking like micromolar\nlevels of CBD which is what a lot of\nStudies have done and so even when we're\ntalking about the alisic modulatory site\nlike yes there's evidence for it and it\nit is convincing evidence it's just the\ndose range in there you're kind of like\nwho's getting hit with CBD at that level\nwhere you're getting these effects and\nmore so when they've done the blinded\nwork like when Ryan Vander at Hopkins\nagain who is one of the main people\nwho's done a lot of this work has\nactually blindly given people CBD dosing\nwith THC finds the opposite that it\nactually amplifies some of the effects\nof THC and this was something we learned\nfrom the Pediatric epilepsy world was\nthat when you start giving CBD\nrelatively high doses one of the things\nthat does is saturate a lot of liver\nenzymes and so some of the efficacy in\nthe Pediatric epilepsy space may be a\nsecondary effect due to an accumulation\nof some of the anti-epileptics as well\nbecause they're not being metabolized\nthe same way and this has now been very\nwell replicated we know that once you\nstart taking CBD when they hit doses\nthat are at the clinical level you're\ngoing to start having hepatic effects so\nit's going to affect the liver and it's\ngoing to affect the ability of the liver\nto chew up other drugs good and there's\nvery specific\num uh sip enzymes like the cluster of\nenzymes that metabolize things there's\nvery specific ones that CBD hits and so\nas a consequence one of them is what\nchoose THC up so you can get a\npotentiation of THC by inhibiting its\nmetabolism if you have high enough CBD\non board given the effects on adenosine\nthat you described before that it's sort\nof the what we're calling just for sake\nof discussion the anti- caffeine how do\nwe explain the preponderance of CBD\nadded to energy drinks that also contain\ncaffeine there's like no logic there\nbias there you go everything everything\ncan't be expected to I have a feeling\nit's going to be interesting to see in\nthe comment section on YouTube I mean\npresumably there's some um Regular pot\nsmokers uh listening to this and you\nknow the expectancy bias is so strong as\nI alluded to in the placebo episode and\nwe've been talking about here um and yet\nit's so strong that I think people will\nalso be convinced that there are real\ndifferences between different strains\nbecause they've maybe done the you know\nnon-formal blind uh you know someone\nsomeone gave them\ntheir weed and someone else and then\nthey got a completely different effect\nright they're not expecting something um\ndifferent necessarily um or in a\nparticular direction but they get a very\ndifferent effect but that to me just\nspeaks to the idea that again cannabis\nsounds like polypharmacology 70\ndifferent cannaboids THC being among the\nmore powerful components but it's um\nit's yolked in the sense that as you\nsaid people self-regulate their intake\nprovided they're smoking not ingesting\nit by edible and so it's almost like T\nis being held constant and then there's\nthis constellation of other things\naround it that are modified and people\neventually Veer towards what they like\nwhat they can afford what works with\ntheir lifestyle and then they come up\nwith a bunch of theories based on\npackaging what they're told but\npresumably also some real effects of\nthese Turpin the CBD component Etc it\ncan't all be just psychological\nexpectation I mean so what you're saying\nis like what we said is the Entourage\neffect and I think that is a theory that\nis held by a lot of people that this\nexists I mean the reality is these tpes\nand minor canab exist at such low levels\nthat like there's a couple of kinds of\ncannabis that might have like a high\nenough level where you're seeing\nsomething but yeah I mean I agree to the\nextent that it would be a little wild if\neveryone's subjective experience across\ndifferent kinds of cannabis was entirely\ndriven by some kind of expectancy which\nI can't imagine is accounting for all of\nit but I think when we talk about sativa\nversus indica I think there's a huge\nbias that's going into there um but one\nof the things with CBD that's\ninteresting unlike THC is you can\nactually do pretty clean blinded studies\nbecause it's really hard to give someone\nTHC and them not know they're on THC\nright this was the big problem with the\nMDMA trial that happened recently is\nthat people who got the placebo knew\nthey got Placebo people got the drug\nknew they got the drug it's very hard\nyou could do a dose response but it's\nvery diff it's very challenging to give\nsomeone a psychoactive drug and a\nplacebo and them not know which one they\nhave whereas because CBD doesn't produce\nan intoxicating state it's not really\nperceptible from the person who's taken\nit um that it's doing anything that\nactually does make it far more amenable\nto do blinded trials with and so I mean\nthe interesting thing with CBD and this\nis where I get a lot of people that get\nangry at me as well is that I would\nargue that the overwhelming majority of\nthe effects of CBD that people report\nare all Placebo effects and I say that\nbecause people Leverage The epilepsy\nstuff and some of the clinical work and\nsay but we know it does things and my\nresponse to them is do you know what\ndose those people are getting because\nthis is something that for some reason\nhas not made the transition from science\ninto pop culture this is a similar\nPhenomenon with\nglp1 um I and other people have pointed\nto the fact that certain food products\nor certain um drinks or certain\nactivities can increase gp1 Glon like\npepti which is now becoming more um\ncommonplace knowledge uh because of OIC\nmonjaro Etc as um very powerful weight\nloss tool although there's questions\nabout muscle loss Etc and then we had Dr\nZachary Knight on who explained that\neven a four-fold increase in glp1\nbrought about through a prescription\ndrug or ingestion of a particular food\nor drink does not lead to any\nappreciable weight loss however when one\nachieves thousandfold increases in glp1\nthrough the use of things like OIC\nmonjaro you see profound weight loss\nmeaning that you need enormous effects\nin order to see the the clinically\nrelevant changes in in that case weight\nloss so it sounds like a similar thing\nwith with CBD so so if somebody um takes\na CBD gummy and they feel that they\nsleep better you would argue that that's\nentirely expectation bias I think that's\na placebo effect and I say that because\nthe majority of gummies are what like\ntwo migs five migs 20 migs maybe I I've\nnever taken a CBD product I know a few\nyears ago they were all the rage I just\nI was never tempted to do it um and I'm\naware and we'll talk about this a little\nbit more that there is evidence\naccording to Matt Walker who did a six\nepisode series with on sleep that THC\ndoes help certain people fall asleep but\nit can dramatically alter the\narchitecture of sleep in ways that are\nprobably not great yeah yeah I mean THC\nand sleep is definitely a whole other\nthing um but sure a lot of people report\nthis with CBD but again so most CBD\nEdibles or things that people take that\nare sold through commercial markets are\nin the range of two to 25 Megs of CBD so\nthen I say to them so you're aware that\nin the pediatric epilepsy studies the\ndose ranges are like 1,500 to 2,000 M\nand then you're talking about a child\nwho weighs on the order of what 20 kilos\nmaybe you know like 40 60 pounds\nsomewhere in that range versus so if you\nstart dosing by weight which is how most\nof these things are done well they'll\nsay 20 Megs per kig or whatnot um so so\nsomeone my size so I weigh a bit over\n200 pounds for me to take that dose of\nCBD uh and let's say 20 migs per kig at\nlike 90 odd kilos I mean you're talking\nabout me taking a liver damaging dose an\ninsane or maybe I wouldn't say damaging\num it's definitely influencing how the\nliver metabolizes other things because\nit's going to saturate those enzymes but\nyou're taking a very high dose so if for\ninstance you were to take a high dose of\nCBD and then maybe uh have a couple\nalcohol containing drinks that could be\nproblematic right because now you're\ntalking about the two- hit model yeah I\nI can't speak to that because I actually\ndo not know the metabolism of alcohol\nwell enough I don't believe so cuz\nthat's alcohol dehydrogenase so that\nwould probably be a separate enzyme\npathway than the sips this is more like\nseparate enzyme pathway but you're but\nyou're um challenging the liver yeah but\nI don't know if it would have an effect\nin that capacity I mean they've\ndefinitely seen this like they know the\nlist of medications that this is a\nproblem for so it's things like warin um\nand like blood thinners uh in the\nanti-epileptics funnel into the same\nmetabolic pathway as this THC so there's\ncertain things that this would influence\nI don't know if I would say this would\nbe in the context of alcohol but I think\nmore so I mean what I try and point out\nto people repeatedly is I have yet to\nsee a blinded clinical study that has\nfound any effect of CBD that's\nefficacious that's under 300 to 500\nmilligrams and yet in in the wild and\npeople who are using it on their own\nwere using doses of 10 to 20 milligrams\nand Reporting these effects and the\nthing is that I think a lot of people\ndon't also realize is CBD has absolutely\nhorrific bioavailability like so if you\ntake it orally in a in an oil or in a\ngummy or whatever you consume it in now\nthis might be different with some of\nthese beverages that are out there I\ndon't know if anyone's actually ever\ndone the pharmacokinetics on them at\nleast I've never seen it um but standard\nRoots we're talking 4% like very very\nlittle actually leaves your gut into\nyour bloodstream now we do know from the\nstudies from GW who created the\npharmaceutical version of CBD that was\nused for a lot of the Pediatric epilepsy\nstudies that they did I don't know if it\nwas random or intentional find that\nopposite to something like alcohol if\nyou had just eaten a fatty meal that\nactually enhanced the bioavailability of\nCBD dramatically so then it went up to\nlike maybe 20% got into the blood but\nthat's probably because again CBD is a\nfatty molecule it likes fatty\nenvironments and for some reason having\nfat in the stomach and in the gut seems\nto promote its ability to get into the\nbloodstream you can see it now it's the\nsteak in CBD or the the CBD with\nomelette uh protocol I'm just kidding\nfolks I'm not I'm not suggesting that\nprotocol but yeah it I mean and so\nbecause of this it's like you're taking\nvery low doses of CBD that have very\npoor bioavailability and then people\nreally stand by the effects of these and\nso I'm like you know what I would always\nsay is if it works for you there's no\nreason to stop it\nbut because you're having benefit from\nit but would I ever recommend someone to\ndo this no I wouldn't because I I can't\nsay that I think that this has any\nbiological activity because even when we\nstart looking at these potential targets\nof what CBD could could interact with\nthere's a couple receptors people have\nsaid you know it might interact with a\nserotonin receptor there's some of these\nlike random orphan receptors that we\ndon't know a lot of what they do that\nCBD might interact with but like the\nconcentrations you need to hit those\nare reasonable and you're not getting\nthat in the blood and certainly not in\nthe brain of people from consuming\nincredibly low doses of CBD so the whole\nMarket that exists for CBD to me is is a\nlittle bizarre and I think for a lot of\nus in the Cannabis field this has been\none of the most bizarre social\nexperiments we've ever watched because\nlike you know if you asked me in 2010 to\nwalk into a room and ask how many people\nknew what CBD is like maybe one out of a\nhundred like no one knew what CBD was\nand now it's like 80 to 90% would know\nwhat it is because everyone you can't\nwalk down a street in any city in North\nAmerica and not see CBD products whether\nit's some kind of cream or like a shake\nor some random like concoction that\npeople have added CBD because now it's\ngoing to you're saying the energy drinks\nlike it's just it's bizarre to me how\nmuch has taken off because it seems to\nhave somehow migrated into being a\nhealth product in some capacity so yeah\nI've never tried any of these CBD\ncontaining products I think uh a lot of\nwhat you're describing speaks to the\nfact that um you know people\nare eager for things that can help them\nadjust their anxiety and sleep better\nyou know which is a large um reason why\na lot of this podcast has focused on\nrespiration based tools and other based\ntools that um can help people with\nanxiety I think that many people suffer\nfrom um just too much uh activation in\ntheir autonomic nervous system and um I\nI would argue there are much better\nthings that are not of a inestable type\nyou know things that one can do that are\nscience supported right there are\nclinical studies um meditation breath\nwork any not so much breath work I would\nargue but um certain patterns of\nbreathing meditation cognitive\nbehavioral therapy there are a whole\nbunch of different things as you know um\nso I don't know what explains the CBD\ncraze but you certainly have shed light\non what is and mainly what is not known\nabout CBD and I think it's really\nimportant for people to hear yeah it I I\nmean again it's I think from my point of\nview it's an ethical thing as well\nbecause like this isn't covered by\ninsurance people are spending their own\nmoney on this and so I find it really\nchallenging to recommend someone to be\nspending what can I mean if you're\nespecially if you're talking about an\nactual clinical dose I mean for someone\nto take CBD at the level where it could\nactually be shown to have some benefit\nin some condition of which currently it\nreally is just Pediatric Epsy like this\nidea with sleep pain anxiety there's not\na lot of super conclusive data and I'd\nsay most of the trials that have been\ndone have not\nfound really good evidence of benefit in\nany capacity so it makes it very\nchallenging to recommend this in any\ncapacity especially I mean if someone if\nfinances aren't an issue sure go for it\nbut um you know I understand people are\nlike you say looking for Solutions so\nites doesn't sound like CBD is the\nsolution I I would I I am not convinced\nby the data that exists that it's really\ndoing what a lot of people claim it's\ndoing yeah except supporting the placebo\neffect perhaps perhaps it's a great\nstudy of the placebo effect I want to\nmake sure before we close that we touch\non some of the potential harms or\nasserted harms of THC because I think\nthere's a lot of misunderstanding about\nthis uh we talked about psychosis and\nthe lack of evidence for a direct causal\neffect um you give a beautiful\ndescription as to how we should think\nabout all of that based on the current\nliterature but\ncannabis and\ndriving is a potential Hazard yeah right\nsome people will laugh they'll be like\noh driving too slow as opposed to you\nknow driving drunk or driving too fast\nokay we can talk about that um we talked\nabout the potential for addiction and\nthe evidence potentially for and against\nthat right um there's also this the big\nblack or gray box of you know all the\nthings we don't know about what regular\ncannabis use could do um and yet I know\na lot of people who' have used cannabis\nfor years mainly as a replacement for\nalcohol at least that's how they\ndescribe it well it's not as bad as\nalcohol that you hear that a lot okay um\nbut what are some actual if any um what\nare some actual harms of cannabis use\nthat people need to take into account\nand just weigh against the fact that\nevery compound caffeine even water can\nkill you if you drink too much of it um\nand then let's make sure that we touch\non this issue of cannabis and driving or\noperating Machinery but I think the\nmachine most people are thinking about\nabout uh these days um is driving yeah\num so Health harms I\nmean someone smoking obviously there's\nrisks for lung damage I would say the\nevidence for things like lung cancer\ncertainly don't hold the way they do\nwith cigarette smoke um because people\nare smoking less of it or there's just\nfewer carcinogens in there I don't think\nyou could make the argument about fewer\ncarcinogens per se I think probably it\nrelates more to the frequency I mean\nDonald tashkin who's in California here\nI think he was at UCL I'm not 100% sure\nbut I know he was in California he did\nlike very long-term studies tracking\ncannabis smokers and basically did not\nfind associations with lung cancer the\nway that you do with cigarette smoking\nwhy that's the case I don't think anyone\nhas like people have theories some\nsuggest because a lot of this inv vitro\nanimal work with really high dosing\nsuggests it could have\nanti-proliferative effects for tumors\nwhether that's real or not I don't know\nbut like I think more likely it's\nbecause most people who smoke cigarettes\nat least that were um you know the\nrelationship with lung cancer were\npeople who were smoking regular\nthroughout the day and it's very rare\nsomeone smokes cannabis at that\nfrequency maybe if they isolated that\npopulation they would see relationships\nwith lung cancer I just don't think it's\nbeen borne out by the data the same way\ncertainly lung damage empyema things\nlike that are on par if you have any\ncombustion product you're going to have\ndamage there there's no question about\nthat so again harm reduction perspective\nwould be you know oral roots of\nadministration bypass lung damage they\ncome with their own issues with dosing\nand whatnot but if you're talking about\nphysical harms that's one thing to avoid\nthat you could bypass that aspect of it\nwith um there is some I don't think we\nare at a point where we can say the the\nstate of it there is something with\ncardiovascular function and cannabis\nthat relates\nto higher frequency of Strokes perhaps\nor cardiac events in some\ncapacity the data is not entirely clear\nin this in this sense yet I mean we\ndon't see again it's not like super\nclean relationships like we're seeing\nthat we're there when we they\nestablished you know cigarette smoking\nand lung cancer kind of thing I think\nthat effect was so profound and the\npopulation of smokers used to be so high\nit was can can this um potential I want\nto highlight potential um relationship\nbetween cannabis use and cardiovascular\nissues um be bypassed no pun intended by\nusing Edibles not inhalant or is it\nrelated to THC\nitself I would probably guess and this\nis a guess um that the you know any\nagain combustion smoke wise I mean maybe\nnot vaping plant matter but at least the\ncombustion from smoking probably\nexacerbates this just because any kind\nof combustion product is going to have\nsome vascular effects to some degree on\nthe system so I imagine would make it\nworse but THC itself has a very complex\neffect on cardiovascular function\nbecause it tends to cause um typically\nvasod dilation so you get widening of\nthe blood vessels which is why it\nrelates to a lot of people will\nexperience postural hypotension so\nsometimes when what that is is if you\nstand up and your blood pressure doesn't\ncatch up with you so you get really\nladed and people will collapse and so\nthis is not uncommon to happen to people\nwhen and with Edibles as well so it's\nnot just from smoking um but when\nthey've consumed cannabis in some\ncapacity there are some people that seem\nto be very sensitive to the vasod\ndilating effects and so when they stand\nup their blood pressure can't match the\nshift and gravity that happens and so\nnot enough blood peruses the brain and\nthey go down and that can be transient\nthey'll come to a minute or two later\nbut it happens um but but as a\nconsequence of the Vaso dilation is it\ntriggers Tachi cardia which is an\naccelerated heart rate and so that's a\nvery reliable physiological response for\na lot of people who use cannabis and so\num it's a bit of a tricky thing because\nobviously if there is some underlying\nheart or a cardiac sensitivity or issue\nthe tacky cardia itself can be a problem\nI mean So like um you know if someone\nhas like an underlying heart condition\nwhere at rest it may not present itself\nbut the shifts into that kind of beating\nfaster to compensate for the fact that\nyou've got a drop on blood pressure um\ncan do put strain on the heart in a way\nthat could unmask a vulnerability or an\nevent and again this is me theorizing\nwhat I think it could be based on what\nwe understand to some degree about how\nit affects cardiovascular function um\nthere are occasionally people who um\nhave reported having like elevated blood\npressure I mean some of that also could\nbe from like an anxiety state or whatnot\ncoming around but the typical response\nand this is usually driven by\ncannabinoid receptors that are in the um\nthe vascular beds themselves that it\ncauses a vasodilatory response and so\nthat is usually the first step the\nsecond is the the uptick in the in the\nheart rate so you get these kind of\neffects over time there's some work\nlooking at like um you know vascular\nstiffness that can evolve over time and\ncannabis users there's some evidence\nthat suggest that you might get more of\nthat emerging and so again that could\nrelate to uh a vulnerability to have\nstrokes or other kind of cardiovascular\nevents in that in that sense\nso I think the issue in terms of like\nwhy it is more difficult for us to say\nanything definitively at this point is\njust obviously the the timeline of this\nI mean you know cigarette smoking was an\neasier thing to establish in that\ncontext because you know once\nantibiotics and Medicine advanced in\nlike the 40s and the 30s and stuff and\npeople started Living longer you started\nseeing a lot of these effects of\ncigarette smoking emerge because and\nyeah it took a while for the um medical\ncommunity to adopt the idea that\ncigarette smoking was bad oh I know it's\nwild Physicians would smoke in clinic\nthe ashtrays in the doctor's office I\nmean my grandparents grew up in Belfast\nthey had smoked for years and they had\neven said like when they were younger\ndoctors would say oh have a cigarette\nafter a meal it promotes digestion so it\nit's kind of wild to hear that stuff\nwhen you think of how cigarettes are\nviewed nowadays but um it is I don't\nthink we've we've kind of been able to\ntrack this long enough to be able to say\nwith certainty what we're seeing but I\nthink there's like if people ask me\nabout risks and harms of cannabis the\nthe the first thing I always say is you\nknow schizophrenia and bipolar those are\nthe main concern areas I think where you\nwant to avoid cannabis um and I would\nalso say if anyone has cardiovascular\nissues they should avoid cannabis just\nbecause that's more of like I would say\na being safe because I don't know how to\nactually explicitly say what I would say\nthe harms associated with it are but I\nthink there is something there I've seen\nenough evidence that's like starting to\ncoales into um a story that's like\nthere's something here so I would that's\nwhere I would say that I think there's\nrisk there's also things like um this\nbizarre cyclic vomiting syndrome which\nis this really strange thing that has\nbecome really apparent uh we've seen\nthis in Canada a bit more now with\nlegalization again because people are\ngoing into ERS more where it's this\nsomewhat strange phenomenon where it's\nusually people who are pretty excess\ncannabis users um they just start like\npuking and they can't stop it and it's\nlike this intractable vomiting that they\nget into and then bizarrely um like one\nof the things that seems to Cur it is a\nhot shower which is I can't even begin\nto understand this I mean there's also\nthe I'm chuckling at the example because\nyou are so very clearly rooted in\nscience but that just came out of\nnowhere like okay cool a hot shower\ndeliberate deliberate heat exposure\nfolks there it is I have been trying to\nunderstand how I'm I'm not I'm not\nenjoying it because it's deliberate heat\nexposure but it just speaks to the fact\nthat we you know we're talking about um\nyou know smoking being uh a regular part\nof the the the medical community\nbehaviors up until you know a few\ndecades ago um and then you know a hot\nshower being the treatment for this like\nchronic vomiting and it it speaks to the\nfact that like with science and medicine\nwe do know a ton it's amazing how much\nwe progresses especially in the last 100\nyears last 25 years even but it's also\nastounding how um the seemingly\nsurprising um antidotes to uh\nuncomfortable conditions can hold up\nover time with in the absence of any\nrandomized control trials or mechanistic\ndata I mean I I've really struggled to\nunderstand because certainly I don't\nthink it was doctors that figured this\nout this was people I think who were\nexperiencing this and then they started\ntelling doctors this and then I think\nand I could only imagine I'm like maybe\nthey're going in the shower CU they're\nlike vomiting on themselves and then\ninadvertently realized that being in a\nhot shower somehow seemed to calm this\ndown I have seen a study where they\nactually applied capsacin cream and that\nalso seemed to provide benefit something\nabout activation of the the something\nwith thermal regulation because the\nother thing that seems to have shown\nsome benefit is propanolol which again\nwould suggest some kind of sympathetic\nwhich is a beta Block it's a beta\nblocker so yeah it's your effect so\nthere's something with autonomic it must\nbe messing up some kind of autonomic\nbalance or something with thermal\nregulation why that results in this kind\nof bizarre vomiting syndrome I have no\nidea but I remember when I first started\nhearing the the stories of this years\nago and I was just like how cuz I mean\nit is again surprisingly\ncounterintuitive because one of the um\nMedical uses that people have used\ncanabas for is as an antinauseant\nespecially in the context of\nchemotherapy and so something that\ntypically has antinauseant qualities\nsuddenly triggering a vomiting syndrome\nis kind of a paradoxical and yet we\nstarted off today's conversation with\nyou explaining beautifully how\nactivation of these um CB1 receptors are\nare homeostatic in some sense the\nthermostat analogy and you know maybe\nafter you know chronic use there there's\nsome you know the Seesaw sort of get fli\nto one side get stuck I think that's how\nmost people have tried to uh kind of\nconceptualize what's going on is maybe\nlike and it seems to involve the insular\ncortex at least the antinauseant effects\nof cannabinoids are involved through the\ninsul cortex um and so maybe you like\nhave burned out those receptors from\nchronic use and so that endogenous\nmechanism isn't working or it's somehow\nflipped in the other direction now and\nthat circuit becomes sensitized but it\nis it is a very bizarre but very real\nthing that seems to happen again this\nisn't common like I've I I've heard a\ncouple of people I've met describe it\nbut it's not like it's happening to\nevery 10th or 20th person or something\nit's little it's a little more\ninfrequent but it's certainly happening\nenough that we've now captured it at a\nfederal data level that this is a thing\nthat people are showing up in the a for\nso interesting so a hot shower yeah so\napparently if it happens hot shower is\nwhat people claim so yeah so for me I\nwould say the the the main harms that\npeople need to be aware of the\nschizophrenia bipolar um possible\ncardiovascular effects and then this is\none of these syndromes that can come out\nof it as well as possible lung damage\nfrom from smoking those are the main I\nthink genuine Bonafide health issues\nassociated with cannabis that people\nshould be aware of I mean and if you I\nmean I know we're not going to probably\ngo into depth with it on the other side\nwith the medical stuff it's a little bit\nmore challenging I mean a lot of this is\njust because we really don't have good\nstudies that have been done in any\ncapacity that have really definitively\ntold this of cannabis has like really\nBonafide medical benefit yeah I was\ngoing to ask you about that it's always\nnice to end on positive side and you\nknow we don't want to demonize cannabis\nnor do we want to glorify it it um but\nyou know the examples that I've heard of\nmedical uses for cannabis include\nappetite stimulation we talked about\nthat um for glaucoma lowering eye\npressure and glaucoma the age and age\nrelated increase in eye pressure um are\ntwo of the major risk factors for\nglaucoma which is the most common\nblinding disease second to cataract um\nmore than 70 million people suffer from\nfrom it everybody regardless of age get\nyour eye pressures checked there are\ndrops for this but okay cannabis can\nreduce eye pressure glaucoma um nausea\nyou mentioned and then anxiety um it\nsounds like if people get the um the\ndose right and it's right for them that\nin some cases it can help them with\ntheir anxiety and the reason I raised\nthat one is because it seems that most\npeople who decide to use cannabis\nregularly are using it as perhaps for\nits euphoric effects but as a kind of a\nmild sedative a way to relax in the same\nway that they would use a glass or two\nof wine what are your thoughts on that\nbecause I think this is the most common\nuse case yeah it I mean you look at I\nmean the other one that that wasn't on\nthere but you've mentioned this before\nand I have as well as pain so chronic\npain pain is I would say the number one\nso pain is certainly the one that\nthere's the most amount of evidence for\nand um I I would say when you talked\nabout this in the previous podcast you\nwere mostly correct about this component\nof it in the sense that it's not that\ncannabis is a profound analgesic it's\nthat\ncannabis it has some analgesic\nproperties but it's not like super\nSledgehammer in that sense but what it\ndoes seem to do is it seems to strip\naway the affective component of pain to\nsome degree and so what I have\nconsistently heard from chronic pain\npatients when they use cannabis is they\nsay yeah my Pain's still there but now\nthe Pain's background noise so I can\nsleep at night and just being able to\nsleep I think is actually providing a\nhuge amount of the benefit to that\nCommunity um but it's the day-to-day\nlike they're able to function with the\npain because it doesn't um they don't\nbecome focused on it the same way\nbecause they're able to kind of push it\nto the background that seems to be the\nmain ability of cannabis I mean yes\nthere's some mild analgesic properties\nto it to some degree but it really seems\nto be much more of that component of it\nand I think you'd alluded to something\nlike that in the previous podcast you'd\nsaid something about it's changing the\nemotional state of pain so and we know\nfrom the biopsychosocial model of pain\nthat emotions and interpretation of the\nsensation of pain is a huge component of\nwhat people refer to as chronic and\nacute pain yeah so so the pain thing I\nthink is is a central one and that's one\nof the only ones that there's a little\nbit of actual research on most of it's\neither with isolated THD I think there's\none or two studies that have actually\nlooked at smoke cannabis and found small\nsignals of benefit but so um anxiety is\nis an interesting one so I mean\nobviously this is more near and dear to\nmy heart because I study Stress and\nAnxiety as my primary area and\ncannabinoids and endoc canabo in that\nspace um and yeah you look at\nquestionnaire based um studies about why\npeople smoke cannabis and like 85 % of\nthem will say because it reduces stress\nand it makes me feel less anxious I mean\nthat was like a big impetus as to why we\nstarted studying endoc canabo regulation\nof it because similar to feeding and\npain where we know endoc canabo are\ninvolved in regulating feeding circuits\nand endoc canabo are also integrated\ninto pain circuitry and can provide some\nendogenous analgesic signals um we\nfigured the same was going to be true\nfor Stress and Anxiety which to some\ndegree it is um but it's very\ncomplicated because it can be like I\nsaid before basic where some you know\nlower doses or angol higher doses can\npromote anxiety but for the majority of\npeople who use cannabis regularly it's\nbecause it helps reduce anxiety now\nwhether that would hold weight in a\nclinical trial is a different story\nthere is some old evidence from like I'd\nsay the 70s or early 80s where they were\nusing synthetic forms of THC like\nnaalone which is something you can get\nin Canada or Marinol or dronabinol which\nI think is what's accessible in the\nstates where they did find some evidence\nto suggest it was on par with like a\nbenzodiazapine like diazapam or\nsomething I can't remember exactly what\nthe comparator they'd used there but\nthere was some evidence for there being\nsome anti-anxiety properties of THC um\nand that tracks generally well with um\nthe self-reported literature that's out\nthere um now whether that's the same as\nan ability to have benefit in something\nlike PTSD is a different question it\ngets a little bit more complicated\nbecause obviously PTSD has an anxiety\ncomponent to it but there's a lot more\nto it as well um and again there's very\nlittle research in this space there was\none really really small study done by\nthe Canadian military um first they did\none version of it that was an open label\nuh open label trials for people who\ndon't know it's just basically everyone\nknows what they're getting it's not\nblinded in any way but because of the\nself-reported data from the veteran\npopulation about um cannabis helping\nespecially with sleep and the big thing\nthat they reported was that it\nsuppressed their nightmares and so you\nknow post-traumatic stress disorder is a\nvery complex disease for many reasons\nand one component of it is the\nre-experience events that happen during\nsleep where there's a lot of nightmares\nand individuals will kind of\nre-experience the trauma that led to the\ndevelopment of the PTSD um and there\ndoes seem to be some suggestion that\nbecause they're remembering it and maybe\nchanging the details because they're in\na Dreamscape space that they\nreconsolidate it a little bit more and\nthere's often a high degree of\nsympathetic activation and arousal that\ngoes on with these nightmares and some\nof the belief is that this is part of\nthe sensitization process that can\nhappen in in PTSD where the disease can\nwork person over time because the\nreexperiencing and the reconsolidation\nand the sensitization of the disease\nthat happens over time in this kind of\nsleep State can make it worse and so the\nmajority of veterans who have used\ncannabis and Report benefit if you\nactually talk to them about it um as\nI've done in a few different situations\nand also just look at the anecdotal data\nalmost all of it talks explicitly about\nsleep and they say oh we you know we use\ncannabis or THC before bed we find we\ndon't have the nightmares and just the\nsimple trickle down effect of that is\nhugely beneficial for them and so the\nCanadian military did an open label\ntrial on this again not blinded it was\nsmall numbers but they basically found\nsoon as they put people on naalone this\num synthetic version of THC it very in\nlike a large proportion I think like 85%\nof them almost stopped having these\nnightmares and this was a like a\ntreatment resistant population that was\npretty severe so this was a big benefit\nso they then took the open label and did\nwhat you should and moved forward to do\na double blind Placebo control now it\nwas a very small sampled studies and\nthat is obviously always a problem with\nhuman work is if this was like 15 or 17\npeople so not powered enough to really\nmake any kind of firm conclusions but\ninteresting in the sense that at least\nit was done in a proper crossover design\nwhere they got Placebo at one point they\ngot Nao at one point it was switched\nthey didn't know which one they were on\num because they're taking it right\nbefore bed maybe that will remove some\nof the subjective bias again you can't\ntotally remove it but like if someone's\ntaking it within you know an hour or so\nif we to sleep they may not feel the\nhigh the same way but even under the\ndouble blinded conditions they found a\nvery effective suppression of the of the\nnightmares and the reexperiencing and\nthen they also at the same time found\nthis increase in kind of quality of life\nmeasures which tracked with the fact\nthat they were probably sleeping better\num I don't think they actually reported\nany change or even looked at maybe the\noverall PTSD score they only reported or\nreally focused on the nightmare\ncomponent of it because that was the\nprimary outcome of the study but so I\nthought that was interesting because\nthat's if you look at the anecdotal data\nin PTSD that's where a lot of it is\nfocused on is the using it as kind of I\nwouldn't maybe call it a sleep aid\nbecause it's really more of a modulator\nof the dream state and I think this\npresumably because it's reducing the\namount of rapid eye movement that you're\ngetting which most people will probably\nhear and interpret as bad but you know\nuh REM deprivation is actually one\ntreatment for depression so there are\ncertain um case conditions where um\ndreaming and REM is not advantageous and\nyou're describing I mean depression and\nPTSD are both two two disorders that are\ncharacterized by changes in Ram like\nthey have earlier onset to Ram so they\ngo into RAM faster they tend to have\nsome altered architecture of the REM\ncomponent of their sleep so in those\nStates maybe suppressing REM isn't\nactually a bad thing at least certainly\nfor PTSD I would imagine in terms of the\ncontext of the nightmares that's\nproviding some benefit whether or not it\nglobally is is changing the disease\nseverity or improving the disease I\ndon't think we really have any evidence\nto say um but again I can understand the\num the desire for people to kind of\nself-medicate let's say by using this as\nan approach to try and reduce that\ncomponent of their sleep so so they\nsleep better they feel better maybe you\nknow maybe down the road it would help\nthe prognosis of the disease long term\nif it's not sensitizing the same way but\nI don't think we have any strong data\nthat we can leverage in that capacity to\nbe able to say it but um to me it's one\nof the more interesting areas I think\nanxiety disorders in general um there's\ndefinitely some potential so as IID\nmentioned earlier um the the fall\ninhibitor that elevates anandamide\nlevels so Johnson and Johnson did do a\ntrial in social anxiety disorder it's\npublished I think from a few years ago\n21 or something I can pull up the\nreference for that where they did find\nsome benefit it wasn't huge and some of\nthis had to do with the design of the\nstudy because they kind of underdosed\nthe patients a bit and so not everyone\nactually showed the elevation in an\nanide when they went back and looked but\nwhen they actually isolated the group of\npeople that had higher anandamide in\nthat proportion of the patients they did\nsee some symptom Improvement so it did\nsupport it and this is I mean very\nsimilar like for us this is a big thing\nbecause all of the work that we focused\non is looking at how stress and stress\nhormones regulate largely anandamide\nsignaling and I mean one of the main\nthings that we've demonstrated that's\nbeen replicated relatively well over the\nyears is that stress exposure um can\nactually cause a rapid loss of\nanandamide signaling and it's that loss\nof anandamide signaling that seems to\nfacilitate some synaptic strengthening\nin the amydala and promote activity in\nareas that are involved in these anxiety\ncircuits and so um the thought has\nalways been well if an emide you know\nit's that job is its kind of tonic\nhousekeeper at keeping things in that\nhomeostatic range let's say we're\ntalking about explicit an anxiety\ncircuit you know there's individual\nvariation that exists in humans across\neverything so one of our predictions has\nbeen maybe people who are on the high\nend of the anxiety Spectrum might be on\nthe low end of their tonic and anomid\nsignaling spectrum and we've gotten a\nlittle bit of support from that from\nanimal work where we've screened animals\nbased on anxiety and looked at endoc\ncanabo levels in the amydala and found\nlower anandamide that's extremely\ninteresting because um it squares with u\nmy uh again non-laboratory observation\nthat a lot of people use cannabis to\ndeal with their anxiety yeah right so\nwhat you're saying is that you know\nthere's a range of um kind of let's just\nsay Baseline circuit activation within\nthe amygdalin related structures in mice\nin humans presumably in other animals\nalso if people take a compound that\nadjusts the sort of homeostatic level of\nwhat's considered low moderate and high\nactivation of those circuits that\ninclude the amydala then perhaps they're\nbringing their anxiety into range um in\na way that perhaps is different than\nwith alcohol which is more acute you\nknow people have a couple drinks they'll\nfeel relax but then there's this\nphenomenon of of anxiety you know the\nnext day um feeling a little anxious\nwhen they're not drinking whereas um\nit's interesting that many people who\nuse cannabis for this purpose are not\nusing it all day long they are perfectly\nable to wait until the night time or\nevening and of course people can wait\nfor happy hour for a drink as well but\nit's far and away different than the way\nwe envision something like Al alol use\ndisorder where somebody discovers that\nalcohol really helps with their anxiety\nand then they're drinking you know maybe\none at lunch maybe a couple at dinner\nand then in the evening to fall asleep\nat night um I'm describing extremes here\nbut I find your hypothesis um to square\nreally well with the real world\nobservations yeah it's an interesting\none there is some evidence to actually\nsupport so my buddy S Patel who's at\nNorthwestern now but he was at\nVanderbilt when he did this study um\nthey basically played with these drugs\nthat you can use to prevent endoc canabo\nsynthesis so you can create a state of\nlike um impaired endoc canabo function\nand in humans and they did this in\nrodents okay so this was done in mice\nand they basically but the one of the\nquestions was is so a does like you know\nreductions in endoc canabo function\nproduce states of anxiety and they did\ndemonstrate that so you could deplete\nendoc canabo levels and you got the\nemergence of an anxiety state so then\nyou could give drugs that would boost\nthe endoc canabo to normalize this um so\nagain it kind of fit with the idea but\nthen they did one key study where then\nthey gave THC and saw could THC fell in\nthe Gap and they found that like\nboosting endoc canabo giving THC on a\nbackground of low endoc canabo was able\nto reverse that anxiety phenotype and\nbring it back into more of the normal\nrange so again maybe for some people\nthis is if this is again this is\ntheoretical so I don't know how much of\na spectrum there is if there are people\nthat are at this low end but certainly I\nthink from the animal literature there's\nsome foundation for making a theory\nthat's similar to what you're saying\nwhich is maybe some people are trying to\nfill in a gap of something that's icient\nin them and therefore that can help them\nfeel less anxious and that again may be\nvery different than someone who is like\nyou know very anxious for different\nreasons or has normal endoc canabo\nfunction or something else might be at\nplay there so very interesting yeah I\nthink it could explain some of the\nheterogeneity that exists out there for\nsure yeah so perhaps genetic differences\nin sort Baseline levels of anxiety\nperhaps map to endogenous levels of\nanandamide and might predict propensity\nfor THC use yeah I mean we have\ndefinitely found uh in human population\nthrough work I've done with a lot of\nclinical collaborators and others like\nyou know we look at endoc canabo in the\nblood and it's not in the brain but they\nare lipids that can move pretty easily\nback and forth um and we have found\nrelationships between peripheral endoc\ncanabo levels and mood States both\nanxiety and kind of depressive measures\nwhich does you know somewhat relate to\nthe the possibility that this could be\nreal we don't know um it's it's it's\nbeen hard obviously for various reasons\nto really track this but we've never\nlooked at an anxiety disorder population\nwe've done some work with post-traumatic\nstress disorder populations there's been\nwork in depression populations that have\nfound some relationships that are pretty\nsimilar so it's certainly a possibility\num but again this is all like our Theory\nat this point so we'll see as things\nkind of move forward if they pan out but\nyeah fantastic and I really appreciate\nthat you're able to share some of what\nyour laboratory is working directly on\nnow and looking into the\nfuture and I want to thank you uh for\nwhat has been an incredibly clear\nprecise and in many cases actionable\nwhether or not it leads to a yes or a no\num actionable information here because\ncannabis and CBD as you pointed out are\nkind of everywhere around us yeah and\npeople are making decisions about um\ncannabis and\nCBD and I also want to thank you because\nwhat initially started off as a bit of a\nconfrontation online which I alluded to\nin the uh introduction that I gave um\nhas evolved into a collaboration that\nI'm certain based on the uh exquisitely\nclear and generous information that\nyou've provided um has led to better\neducation more clarity and therefore\nbetter informed choices for all the\npeople listening and watching so I\nreally truly appreciate you coming out\nhere sitting down with me discussing\nthese issues uh clarifying points that\nwere unclear before um and and also\npointing the fact that this is a complex\nsystem a complex bi ology um you know\nthere are a lot of things about\npsychosis about negative effects about\npotential um positive uses of cannabis\nthat just are not yet clear and thanks\nto excellent researchers like you are\nlikely going to be clarified in the\nyears to come so um thank you ever so\nmuch for your time for your research and\nfor your attention to the public health\neducation effort around cannabis thank\nyou and I think it's also important I\nthink it's good as you had said that\nlike uh for people to see that\nscientists can have disagreements\nabsolutely I think it's important um I\nthink it's good that you kind of\nprovided me an opportunity to correct\nthe record um and did so in a very\nappropriate manner I think this was a\ngreat discussion for people to\nunderstand um different perspectives\nalso good to\nhighlight where it was that I had had\nissue with your previous podcast and um\nI think the discussions that came out of\nthat were for the better so that's all\nthe best and Hope hopefully if there's\nother contentious issues that happen\ndown the road similar things move\nforward and you chat with people are\nwell yeah if somebody who is expert in a\nparticular area takes issue with\nsomething specific and can substantiate\nit with something that um can foster\nbetter understanding um without fail\nI'll reach out to them now how quickly\nwe're able to get them here uh Etc is is\nalways an issue sometimes uh we can put\nan addendum to a podcast um now nowadays\nthat's easier using um what's called\nDynamic insertion where we can go back\nand actually make a correction but\nlisten the best situation is always when\nthis podcast can mimic the real world of\nresearch science as you and I both know\nit to exist where uh if we had been in a\nmeeting and you presented data I\npresented data and we disagreed what we\nwould probably do would be to head well\ntraditionally it would be to the bar but\nwe'd grab a cup of coffee or go for a\nwalk and we would um talk about it hash\nit out and then potentially bring it up\nagain at the next meeting so in some\nsense what we've done here over the last\nmonth or so\num and certainly during today's podcast\nis to do something uh to that effect so\nand I think it's really good for people\nin the public to know this is how\nscience progresses this is you know\nsomeone says something someone disagrees\nwith it you get an opportunity to\nclarify things and I think that that's\nreally good uh just to move things\nforward so I think that was a a good\nprocess that we've gone through yeah\nlikewise and it's certainly within the\nspirit of the podcast in no way shape or\nform do I um purport to get everything\nright and where I've made mistakes I I\nreally strive to correct them and listen\nit's been a real honor and privilege to\nhave you out here thanks for coming all\nthe way from Canada and I do hope to\nhave you back again as the research\nevolves and we can learn more about\nthese topics and more so thank you so\nmuch Matt appreciate you great thank you\nfor joining me for

of\none to three pages where I spell out the\nspecific dos and in some cases do Nots\nbut mostly dos related to things like\nhow to optimize your sleep how to\nregulate your dopamine levels there's a\nprotocol for neuroplasticity and\nlearning as well as protocols for\nFitness which we call the foundational\nFitness protocol includes everything\nsets reps cardiovascular training again\nall
