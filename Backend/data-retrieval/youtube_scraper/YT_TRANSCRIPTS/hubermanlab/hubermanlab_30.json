    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr David\njoerger Dr David joerger is a professor\nof psychology at the University of Texas\nat Austin and one of the world's leading\nresearchers into mindsets in particular\ngrowth mindset which is a mindset that\nenables people of all AG es to improve\ntheir abilities at essentially anything\nhe is also a world expert into the\nstress is performance enhancing mindset\nwhich is a mindset that allows people to\ncognitively reframe stress and that when\ncombined with growth mindset can lead to\ndramatic improvements and performance in\ncognitive and physical Endeavors Dr\njoerger is also the author of an\nimportant and extremely useful new book\nentitled 10 to 25 the science of\nmotivating young people the book is\nscheduled for release this Summer that\nis the summer of 2024 and we provided a\nlink to the book in the show note\ncaptions during today's discussion Dr\nJer explains to us exactly what growth\nmindset is through the lens of the\nresearch into growth mindset and he\nexplains also how to apply growth\nmindset in our lives he also shares the\nresearch from his and other laboratories\non the stress can be performance\nenhancing mindset and how that can be\ncombined with growth mindset to achieve\nthe maximum results so while I assume\nthat most people have heard of growth\nmindset today's discussion will allow\nyou to really apply it in your life not\njust from the perspective of you the\nperson trying to learn but also for\nteachers and coaches in fact Dr Jer\nshares not just the optimal learning\nenvironments for us as individuals but\nalso between individuals and in the\nclassroom in families in sports teams\nand in groups of all sizes and kinds\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is arero press arero\npress is like a French press but a\nFrench press that always Brews the\nperfect cup of coffee meaning no\nbitterness and excellent taste Aero\npress achieves this because it uses a\nvery short contact time between the hot\nwater and the coffee and that short\ncontact time also means that you can\nbrew an excellent cup of coffee very\nquickly the whole thing takes only about\n3 minutes I started using an aerop press\nover 10 years ago and I learned about it\nfrom a guy named Alan Adler who's a\nformer Stanford engineer who's also an\ninventor he developed things like the\naobi Frisbee in any event I'm a big fan\nof Adler inventions and when I heard he\ndeveloped a coffee maker the Aro press I\ntried it and I found that indeed it\nmakes the best possible tasting cup of\ncoffee it's also extremely small and\nportable so I started using it in the\nlaboratory when I travel on the road and\nalso at home and I'm not alone in my\nlove of the Aeropress coffee maker with\nover 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is\nthe best reviewed coffee press in the\nworld if you'd like to to try Aeropress\nyou can go to Aero press.com huberman to\nget 20% off Aeropress currently ships in\nthe USA Canada and to over 60 other\ncountries around the world again that's\nAero\npress.com huberman today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by Roa Roa makes\neyeglasses and sunglasses that are of\nthe absolute highest quality now I've\nspent a lifetime working on the biology\nof the visual system and I can tell you\nthat your visual system has to contend\nwith an enormous number of different\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly Roa understands this and\nhas developed their eyeglasses and\nsunglasses so that regardless of the\nconditions you're in you always see with\nthe utmost Clarity Roa eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially designed for\nuse in sport in particular things like\nrunning and cycling now as a consequence\nRoa frames are extremely lightweight so\nmuch so that most of the time you don't\neven remember that they're on your face\nthey're also designed so that they don't\nslip off if you get sweaty now even\nthough they were initially designed for\nperformance in sport they now have many\ndifferent frames and styles all of which\ncan be used in sport but also when out\nto dinner at work essentially anytime\nand in any setting if you'd like to try\nRoa glasses you can go to Roa that's\nr.com and enter the code huberman to get\n20% off again that's r.com and enter the\ncode huberman to get 20% off and now for\nmy discussion with Dr David joerger Dr\nDavid joerger welcome thanks for having\nme can you tell us your definition of\ngrowth mindset I think most people have\nheard of it they have some some sense of\nwhat it is but you've worked uh very\nintensely on growth mindset for a number\nof years so I'd love to know how you\ndefine it yeah so it's it's simply the\nbelief that your abilities or your\npotential in some domain can change um a\nhuge confusion is people think it means\nif you try hard then you can do anything\nbut that's not really the idea it's it's\nsimply that under the right conditions\nwith the right support change is\npossible\nand you know that ends up being a pretty\npowerful idea because the opposite is so\nstressful right the idea that\nyou are static nothing about you can\nchange is is really kind of a stressful\nidea of all the uh studies on growth\nmindset um including yours ones that\nyou've participated in um what one or\ntwo kind of highlevel results um stand\nout to you as the most striking\nsurprising exciting or meaningful and\nhere I will encourage you to discard\nwith attribution we know that um or\neveryone should know that Carol dwac is\nthe originator of the growth mindset\nidea um as a field and she deserves um\ntremendous credit for that so yeah um so\nwhen you stand back from the field given\nthat it's it's mushroomed into this very\nlarge field now and you look at that\nresearch which results kind of stand out\nas like wow that's really cool really\nmeaningful people should know about that\nwhat stands out to me a lot first of all\nis just the field experiments that the\nidea that you can distill a complex idea\nabout the brain about malleability you\ncan give it to a young person at a time\nwhen they're\nvulnerable and that that can give them\nhope and then they can do better at\nschool or whatever so our 2019 paper in\nnature uh that Carol Greg Walton Angela\nDuckworth a lot of us collaborated on\ntook a very short growth mindset\nintervention two sessions about 25\nminutes each for ninth graders and we\nfound kids were eight nine months later\nmore likely to get good grades uh by\n10th grade more likely to be in the hard\nmath classes and the unpublished results\nfind effects four years later on\ngraduating high school with colle ready\ncourses from a short intervention\nhappened you know just one or two times\nno reinforcement so so that there's a\nlot of reasons why that's true that\nsounds magical and and outrageous and\nthere are a lot of mechanisms but that\njust demonstrates the overall value of\nthe phenomenon and we in that study we\ndid everything we possibly could to\naddress legitimate skepticism right are\nwe collecting and processing the data in\nways that could bias it no third party\nis it are we handpicking schools where\nyou could get the best effects no random\nsample of schools did we post talk\ndecide on the analyses that would make\nthe results look the greatest no\npre-registered so that's a good like\nokay this phenomenon is\nnot something that falls apart in the\nhands of anyone else besides a select\nfew researchers that's really and we can\ngo into that but that doesn't explain\nthe mechanisms and I think that there\nare a lot of interesting growth mindset\nmechanism studies my personal favorite\nis a very\nunderappreciated kind of like indie rock\nstudy by David newbound and Carol DW\nthat David did uh when he was a graduate\nstudent at Stanford um and it's on\ndefensiveness versus remediation and the\nbasic idea is in a fixed mindset the\nidea that your intelligence cannot\nchange you are the way you are it can't\nchange\num your goal in that fixed mindset is to\ndefend your ego to like hide your\ndeficiencies or any flaws because if\nthey're fixed and then they're revealed\nthen it labels you for life in some way\nas less than shame worthy Etc right in a\ngrowth mindset though mistake is like\npart of the process it's it's just an\nopportunity to grow so David took that\nidea and then set up a\nstudy and I think I have the details\nright where undergraduates did a task\nthey all did poorly they were getting 20\n30% correct on this task and the\nquestion is what do you do before you do\nyour second dry how do you cope with\nthat initial failure and he found that\nboth fixed and mindset participants\nwanted to recover their self-esteem so\nyou do poorly you feel like crap what am\nI going to do to feel better about\nmyself in a fixed mindset they looked\ndownward so the people getting a 25 look\nat the people who got a 12 like I'm\ntwice as good as these losers right in a\ngrowth mindset they look at the people\ngetting an 85 or 90 what what are they\ndoing what are their strategies how can\nI\nimprove both of them then recovered\nself-esteem and look the same at post\ntest and I think about that a lot like\nhow often in our\nsociety does something happen to us and\nwe feel like garbage and you have a\nchoice like am I going to look down on\nother people and say at least I'm not as\nbad as these losers or am I going to say\nlike how am I going to get better and I\nI just I love that because think of a\nninth grader who bombs their Algebra\ntest am I like a no good dumb at math\nloser who's not going anywhere in life\nwell at least I'm not that burnout right\nor is it\nlike how is anyone getting an A in this\nclass I'm not getting an a what's\nhappening what what can I learn from\nthem so the open openness and\nwillingness to\nself-improve I think is the underwriting\nmechanism and I and hardly anyone cites\nthat study but I think about it all the\ntime and it's the kind of thing that I\nlike from being honest that's the\nmindset I want like kids they have as\nthey go through life very interesting\nI'm going to ask you more about this\nlooking down or looking up yeah um in\nterms of performance but before I do\nthat I have questions about these brief\nuh 25 minute I think you said\ninterventions yeah sometimes 25\nsometimes we do two sessions each about\n20 25 yeah can you give us a sense of\nwhat those interventions look like I\nmean it's incredible these two sessions\nhave positive effects lasting up to four\nyears and perhaps even Beyond yeah um\nmaybe just a top Contour of uh some of\nwhat these kids hear during those\nsessions yeah I mean so the first thing\nto realize is\nthat they're short and they have to do\ntwo things in order to have long-lasting\neffects one is I have to convince you to\nthink differently at the end of the\nsession so I just have to persuade you\nover the course of 25 minutes to have a\ndifferent mindset that's sometimes hard\nbut then even if I that you then might\nhave months or years between when I did\nthat and when the outcome is measured so\nhow could you remember it and apply it\nand how many 25 minute experiences in\nyour life you no recollection of right I\nhave lots so I think I think people are\nskeptical of the mindset style of\ninterventions for two different I think\nlegitimate reasons like I remember a\nvery famous statistician came to my\noffice at at UT Austin and was like I\njust don't understand these\ninterventions I mean the other day I\nspent 25 minutes telling my son all the\nthings he has to change and like how\nhe's doing everything wrong and he\ndidn't remember at 5 minutes later how\ncould someone remember your thing four\nyears later and I was like did you hear\nyourself talking like I'm sure the way\nyou talked to your son was like totally\ncondescending and bad so the the first\nstep is in that 25 minutes how are you\ncommunicating in a way where someone's\nears are open where they're not feeling\ntalked down to ashamed humiliated\nEtc but then the second step is saying\nthat to you at a time when it's possible\nfor there to be a what we call a\nrecursive process or a Snowball Effect\nthat's going to happen over time so\nthat's the stage setting okay so now\nlet's take the first part 25 minutes\nwhat am I going to say to you right um\nthere are three big things that are in\nevery intervention and the term that\nGreg Walton the Stanford Professor uh\ncolleague collaborator um uses is wise\ninterventions that's the umbrella term\nof which growth mindset is\none and a good one but it's just one of\nmany for wise interventions we often do\nthe following three things first is we\npresent some new scientific information\nsome idea that almost in like a Gladwell\nway is not is not obvious and intuitive\nto the reader but feels like new\ninformation and useful information so\nthe first is a scientific the second is\nwe present participants with stories\nfrom people like them who've used those\nideas in their lives and found them\nuseful so in the concrete case of ninth\ngraders getting growth mindset it's like\n10th 11th 12th graders who previously\nfelt dumb learned a growth mindset then\nfelt better that's it's more complicated\nthan that that's the basic idea and last\nwe don't just tell them the stories we\nask third for participants to to author\na story so they write a narrative about\na time when they struggled a time when\nthey doubted themselves and then\nremembered this idea that people can\nchange like my brain can grow Etc so the\nthree points are like scientific\ninformation stories or the the technical\nterm is descriptive Norms so you're\ngiving\npeople information about what's normal\nfor people like you and then the third\nis the writing which we call saying is\nbelieving uh which is a a term that\nthat's a popularized version of a term\nthat came from classic social\npsychologist Josh Aronson Elliot Aronson\nwho who found in the work on cognitive\ndissonance 30 40 years ago that one of\nthe best ways to change someone's mind\nabout something is to ask them to try to\npersuade somebody\nelse so that we do those sort of things\nso what is the science and the growth\nmindset that's where we draw on the\nmetaphor that the brain is like a muscle\nthat um just like muscles get stronger\nwhen they're challenged and can you know\nrecover so too does the brain get\nsmarter when it's pushed and challenged\nin a certain way this idea that writing\na story about one self or about others\nin which one succeeds can be useful\ntoward building growth mindset in you\nknow in basic terms I think that's what\nwhat you're what you're referring to I\nthink is interesting it sort of suggests\nthat that we have brain circuit that\nunderly growth mindset type behaviors\nand thinking and that just storing into\nthose can potentially um lead to better\ndecision-making and behavior I mean\nobviously it can't create new\nskills um simply because you know I\ncan't write a story about me being able\nto dunk a basketball and then expect\nthat I can dunk a basketball because at\npresent I can't but the idea of uh\nwriting a story about um the effort\ngoing into duny basketball and learning\nhow and then Translating that to a more\num realistic sense of of ability that\nallows me to then go practice more is\nthat sort of what you're referring to\nyeah so the in in a 2016 paper in pnas\nGreg Walton and I explained these types\nof interventions as a we call them a lay\nTheory intervention and the idea there\nis that lay people like not not\nscientific theories but just our\nintuitive theories for explaining the\nworld help us anticipate what something\nmeans so the the idea from basic\ndevelopmental psychology is that human\nbeings are walking around with kind of\nPrior belief about objects about motion\nabout you know number and then later\nabout complex social structures like\nwhether people are looking down on me\nhow where I stand relative to others and\nalso lay little lay Theory about\nadversity what does it mean when I have\nto put in effort what does it mean when\nI\nfail so the idea is that if you if you\nunderstand the theory someone has then\nyou'll understand the meaning they'll\nmake about a future\nexperience um and therefore well and the\nreason meaning matters is because the\nthe way you interpret something then\naffects how you respond to it right so\nif I see someone and they're doing\nsomething innocuous but I interpret it\nas a threat do I call the police you\nknow do I run away\nthat's my interpretation that's causing\nit right um and so the there's a long\nway of saying it turns out one of the\nbest ways to preset someone's meaning\nand give them a different theory is to\ngive them a different\nstory uh stories are kind of like\ntheories in\nmotion this is why you know like what's\nthe point of war in peace right war in\npeace is is really a theory of of great\nleaders in the war um and there's any\nEnglish phds I'm sure they'll tell me\nthat that's oversimplified version of\nwhat to sto was doing but you learn the\ntheory in a narrative way right so this\nis the classic idea throughout human\nhistory great writers and authors give\nus theories through narrative right and\nso we're just taking that simple human\nfact and doing it in a 10-minute\nactivity and the lay theory in a\nperson's mind that when things are\ndifficult it can\nchange can be taught with a very simple\nnarrative which is the this person or\neven I experienced difficult difficulty\non something that mattered to me that\ndifficulty didn't determine my entire\nfuture because actually there were steps\nthat I could take in order to like make\na difference here are the steps that I\ntook and then it improved so it's a very\nlike the simplest freay tags pyramid and\neven though that simple story is\navailable to all of us you could look in\nculture and see it you also see the\nopposite lay Theory all the time and so\nwithout absent intervention it's not\nlike people couldn't end up with a\ngrowth mindset but they wouldn't kind of\nknow what to sort for or what to look\nfor so we give them some touch points\nfor very simple of like frustration\nthings can change then they got better\nand we think that once people do that in\nour writing exercises they're more\nlikely to see that pattern out in the\nworld and if you see that enough and\nthen you take the actual steps to get\nbetter then it starts becoming true for\nyou and that's what I called the\nrecursive process that you we give\npeople a starting hypothesis about the\nworld they go out try things struggle\nfail it\nimproves then they see that that's true\nand then they can keep acting on that\nover time I feel like so much of getting\nbetter at things\ninvolves reappraising the um stress or\nanxiety response you know the um the\nfriction that one feels when they can't\nperform something well or when things\nfeel overwhelming or confusing um and I\nthink the analogies to physical exercise\napply but I feel like they're Limited in\nthe sense that I like the the idea that\nthe brain is like a muscle that it can\ngrow and get stronger I think the um the\nkey difference to my mind is that you\nknow like working out with weights um\nyou get some sense of the result you're\ngoing to get because there's like a lot\nof blood flow into the muscle so it's\nlike a hint of what's possible um with\ncardiovas ular exercise like if we run\nhard up a hill there's that moment where\nyour lungs are burning Etc and anyone\nwho understands exercise knows that\nthat's the signal for adaptation such\nthe next time you can do the same thing\nwithout the burning of the lungs right\num when it comes to mental work and\nlearning I\nthink we immediately assume that if\nwe're not performing well if we're\ngetting confused or overwhelmed that\nsomehow um we're doing it wrong yeah um\nas opposed to stimulating the growth\nright and so I are there any studies\nthat point going to um Bridging the\nrelationship between the physiology you\nknow that the stress response and the\nmindset that allows one to say okay this\nis really hard and I keep failing and\nfailing and failing at this math at this\nlanguage learning at writing this essay\nwhatever it is and that's exactly what\nI'm supposed to be doing it's like the\nburning of the lungs or it's like the\nfailure to complete another repetition\num in the in the gym yeah I mean I think\nthat that you're right um you know the\nstandard growth mindset message does\nhave reappraisal components specifically\naround something Carol D has called\neffort beliefs which is very simply the\nbelief that if it's hard it means you're\ndoing the wrong thing and that follows\nnaturally from the fixed mindset idea\nthat ability can't change and I think\nit's very important to point\nout the centrality of that effort belief\nbecause people have tried to apply\ngrowth mindset but simplified it in a\nway of just saying uh basically try\nharder right or I believe in you if you\ntry hard enough you can do anything\nright but if your natural inclination is\nto view the need for effort as a sign\nthat you are doing the wrong thing which\nis that's the default\ninterpretation uh then people are going\nto quit right if if I tell if you\nbelieve effort out to you as lacking\npotential and then I say you need to try\nhard I'm saying you don't have\npotential that basic Insight is very\npoorly misunderstood in the field and\nit's led to tons of misapplications of\nCarol's work and then people like well\nthis thing doesn't work well okay but\nyou haven't addressed the effort belief\nso I think that the first type of\nresponse to what you what You' said\nis you can't just abstractly tell\nsomeone your brain as a muscle and\nassume that magically then in the midst\nof stress and frustration and confusion\nand and all those negative experiences\nthat you're going to immediately say yes\nI love doing this and this is great um\nbut then there's also the physiological\ncomponent as you're saying so when we're\nstressed frustrated you know confused\nyour heart starts racing maybe your\npalms get sweaty right you start your\nbreathing you know starts getting\nheavier uh my my daughter is 13 before\nlike a cello audition it's like I have\nbutterflies on my stomach I don't you\nknow what does this mean and and I think\nthat growth mindset research didn't\nalways deal with the visceral experience\nof stress and\nfrustration and I think in a world in\nwhich someone hears the growth mindset\nmessage and says yes now I'm going to go\nchallenge myself I'm going to be I'm\ngoing to embrace stress and frustration\ndo the mental equivalent of you know\nrunning ladders or running up a hill\nthen they feel that stress but if they\ndon't know how to interpret\nthat they'll they'll it's like the\ngrowth mindset isn't going to get them\nto the skill development right or at\nleast to the mental well-being of\nfeeling like they have confidence and\ncan do well so um in some in some\nresearch that we've done in the last few\nyears what we've tried to do is to marry\ntogether the growth mindset idea with\ngreat work originally coming out of Ali\ncrumb and Jeremy Jameson's Labs who were\nbuilding on lots of great appraisal\npsychologists Wendy Mendes and others to\nsay okay in the inevitable experience\nwhere\nif you if you fully believe our growth\nmindset and then now you load your plate\nwith challenges but now you've got a\nphysiological stress\nresponse how are you going to appraise\nthat better and that's kind of been the\nNew Frontier of growth mindset uh work\nin the last four or five years yeah\ncould you tell us more about this uh\nstresses enhancing mindset I think it's\na really interesting one especially when\nit's woven in with the growth mindset\nyeah so let me tell you kind\nof that on its own and then and then the\nthe story of how how we had this Insight\nis actually kind of interesting too uh\nbut just the basic idea as um you know\npeople who've heard about ali crumb\nwould know and Jeremy Jameson is that\nyou know a an experience of your heart\nracing your palm sweating anxiety in\nyour\nstomach that is itself a new stressor\nthat then needs to be interpreted and\nappraised by the person experiencing\nit um that idea on its own is is kind of\nrevolutionary for people people tend to\nthink that your physiological arousal is\nthis objective experience that is\nuniversally bad Ali Crum calls that a\nstress is debilitating\nbelief um and I think that's a good\nthat's a good label for it it's this\nidea\nthat that heart racing Palm sweaty\nbutterflies in your stomach is a sign of\nyour impending failure in Doom and and\nit will always interfere with your\nperformance and and and the implication\ntherefore is if you were about to do\nwell on whatever you're doing going to\ndo then you wouldn't feel that way right\num Ali crumb calls us being stressed\nabout being\nstressed and that I think it's a really\ncommon experience right now where people\nare like wow you know if I was a\nconfident good person who was about to\ndo well I wouldn't be sitting here\nfeeling so stressed about how stressed I\nam and it becomes this metacognitive\nlayered Loop of of just being stuck in\nyour own mind and and and interpreting\nyour arousal in the most negative\npossible light so um that stress is\ndebilitating belief\ndoesn't people aren't like wrong for\nhaving come to that belief because it's\neverywhere in our culture one thing I do\nin my class A lot is I just have people\nGoogle image search um Stress Management\nmemes and first of all a surprising\nnumber about cats I don't know why\npeople think cat pictures are like the\nway to convey complex scientific ideas\nlike it'll be like a cat with like a\ncookie jar and it'll be like growth\nmindset I don't understand what that\nwhat the point of that is um but you\nknow page two or three after all the\ncats then you get to a lot of things\nthat are you'll see a person with a\nbattery that's empty and it's like they\ndidn't d-stress or 10 tips for\nde-stressing and it'll be like go on a\nwalk drink chamomile tea like and the\nthe the underlying implication is that\nif you're stressed then you need to\ndistract yourself you need to get rid of\nthat stress but an alternative\nexplanation in the growth mindset world\nis well maybe you have something that's\nvery important to you and you've pushed\nyourself to embrace some Challenge in a\nreally admirable way and that has filled\nyour plate in some way the like if I was\nabout to give a presentation to a senior\nvice president at work and I'm stressed\nabout it I should not like go take a\nbubble bath and like go for a walk like\nI should get ready to kick ass the\npresentation you\nknow and so I think what what alium and\nothers have identified is that you can\nthink differently about that stress you\ncan say this is actually a sign that I'm\npreparing to optimize my performance and\nmaybe the heart racing\nisn't my body being afraid of damage\nmaybe it's my body getting more\noxygenated blood to my brain and my\nmuscles to like help me do really well\nand that's called a stress be enhancing\nbelief and what's so interesting I think\nabout this work and I want to give\ncredit to lots of other people um is\nthat if you're in the stress's\ndebilitating mindset you don't realize\nthat there's an alternative you just\nthink that that's the way it is so it\nnever occurs to you to say oh this\nstress is helping me right but once you\ntell people this what happens is in our\nstudies we actually see a change in\nstress physiology it it changing your\nmindset about stress in turn changes how\nyour body reacts which then becomes a\ndifferent stressor that you can\ninterpret um and so the big Insight was\npairing the these ideas about reframing\nstress as an an inevitable Force that's\ngoing to destroy your goal Pursuit into\na resource to be cultivated and pairing\nthat together with the first step which\nis the growth mindset that causes you to\nlike be open to the challenge in the\nfirst place I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by\nnow most of you have heard me tell my\nstory about how I've been taking ag1\nonce or twice a day every day since 2012\nand indeed that's true I started taking\nag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a\nday because it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients are\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed whole\nFoods it's often hard to do so\nespecially when I'm traveling and\nespecially when I'm busy so by drinking\na packet of ag1 in the morning and often\ntimes also again in the afternoon or\nevening I'm ensuring that I'm getting\neverything I need I'm covering all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nregularly just report feeling better and\nthat shouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\nreally directed towards one specific\noutcome like sleeping better or being\nmore alert ag1 really is foundational\nnutritional support it's really designed\nto support all of the systems of your\nbrain and body that relate to mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nwith your order plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman I feel like so much of what\nhuman beings struggle with um such as\nlearning and performance our\nrelationship to stress\nEtc could be resolved if we could\novercome the deficit in language um\nhere's what I'm thinking um we're\ntalking about reframing stress to make\nit performance enhancing as opposed to\nPerformance\ndiminishing I wonder if we replace the\nword stress with just like levels of\narousal but then people hear arousal and\nthey think certain kinds of arousal so\nwhat we want to do is you know the way I\nthink about is like a Continuum of of\nReadiness but then that doesn't work\nbecause Readiness could be Readiness for\nSleep which is a low level of arousal\nyou don't want to be highly alert and\nthen you're not ready for sleep right\nyeah so there's a real deficit of\nlanguage where I think if there was some\nother word I don't I can't come up with\nit on the Fly where you know one's\ninternal level of\nReadiness as opposed to stress and maybe\nit looks a lot like autonomic arousal\nwhere heart rate is increased and blood\npressure is increased and people would\nsay oh yeah that's my body being ready\nfor something as opposed to stress about\ndoing it yeah and it it it's kind of a\ntrivial um you know recasting of stress\non the one hand but in terms of you know\nkids learning about life and stress and\narousal and these internal signals and\nadults learning about those and\nincorporating those into their life\ngoals I think it would be pretty\nmeaningful and I I again I don't a\nsolution to this but I feel like\neveryone hear stress is bad you hear\nstress is enhancing okay great but I\nthink it's really about developing a\nlanguage that lets us interpret what's\ngoing on in our bodies and compare that\nto what we are facing in the moment and\njust decide is this well matched or\npoorly matched to what we need to do is\nit great for going to sleep is it great\nfor learning is it great for um catching\nthat train that's you know soon to leave\nthe station and I just wonder um why the\ndeficit in language yeah I think it's a\nprofound question\nbecause small changes in\nlanguage perpetuate problematic lay\ntheories because they have the baggage\non them and I think that let's think\nthis through so um what the\npsychophysiologists like to point out is\nthat there's a distinction between the\nstressor which is the let's call it the\ninternally or externally imposed demand\ncould be something thwarting your goals\nor the exam the difficult conversation\nthe um the going to for some people\ngoing to the doctor or the dentist the\nhard conversation with you know with\nsomebody you care about it could be um\nor a physical stressor right like a\nfootball game or you know running a\nmarathon right so anything that imposes\ndemands on your body and mind and\ntherefore will require\nresources whether like you know\nmetabolic resources to do well that's a\nstressor okay then there's your\nappraisal of it that's what you name it\nhow you interpret it how you frame it in\nyour mind and then there's your\nresponse people in general conflate the\nstressor with a stress response when\nthey say stress they're like I'm really\nstressed right now well what really what\nyou mean is that there were stressors\nyou appraised them as more than you can\nhandle and then you had a threat type\nstress response which means that your\nbody is preparing for damage and defeat\nand that is like an inheritance of how\nthe you know sympathetic nervous system\nevolved which was to Keep Us Alive from\nthreats mainly physical threats and so\nif you have a stressor some de demand\npraise is something you cannot handle\nand then your threat type response your\nbody's basically assuming you're going\nto lose whatever physical fight you're\nin like the bear is going to you know\ntear you apart and then your main goal\nat that point is to stay alive and like\nbleed out more slowly right so you end\nup with more blood kept centrally in the\nbody cavity Less in the extremities\nright the body releases cortisol because\nit's an anti-inflammatory it's going to\nlike help with tissue repair 45 minutes\ndown the road so there a whole like\nCascade of physiological responses that\ncome in part from the mental appraisal\nthat this stressor is more than you can\nhandle now we're we're very\nrarely confronted with those kinds of\nphysical stressors these days it's often\nsocial stressors but a lot of social\nstressers are a threat of social death\nright like a ninth grader coming into\nhigh school getting bullied by all their\nfriends and are excluded because the eth\ntheir friends in eighth grade now treat\nyou like you don't exist right the\nthreat of social death is pretty bad\nright or you're a new legal associate\nand you've filed your first brief and\nall the partners are like this is\ngarbage we're not going to send it to\nthe client right like all of a sudden\nyou're on trial socially in front of\nthese people who could cut you loose at\nany time that's a very vibrant social\nstressor that evokes the same kind of\nphysiological response as we suppose a\nphysical one would right and so we're\nvery careful to distinguish in our\nstudies a stressor from the stress\nresponse because often the stressor\nisn't really a bad thing like you know\ngetting critical feedback on your first\nlegal brief as a junior associate well\nthat could be awesome it could be like\noh great I have these awesome Partners\nat my great Law Firm are now giving me\npersonalized feedback that's useful or\nI'm a ninth grader and I have to make\nnew friends but I don't know that's\nmaybe you need new friends like that\ncould be a good thing right and and same\nwith a test same with you know\npresentation to senior vice president\nwhatever it is\nstressor often in in our daily lives are\nnot good or bad now of course there's\ntraumatic stressors that you know are\nreally bad for people\num but then the appraisal is really\nwhere there's a lot of\nLeverage and if you think that the\nstressor is inevitably bad and that your\nresponse to it is always harmful then\nit's really hard for you to think that\nyou have the resources to meet the\ndemand that you're facing and you end up\nin this threat\ncycle so in a lot of our research what\nwe try to do is give people a different\nstory to tell themselves about a\nstressor and about their response so\nthat way they end up in a better place\nnow I don't know what that better\nlanguage is but I will say\nI once gave a talk at a middle school in\na high school and I used slides that\nJeremy Jameson who was my collaborator\nhad sent me that had the word arousal on\nit on every single slide and that was a\nbig mistake in a room of like middle\nschool kids right I did not I I strongly\nrecommend different\nterminology uh so and I should I was a\nmiddle school teacher I should have\nknown that you can't say that word in a\nin a high school so right yeah I think\nthat that there needs to be a better\nlanguage I think if people um of all\nages understood the autonomic nervous\nsystem this aspect of our nervous system\nthat um is on a Continuum that leads us\nto either be I guess at the extremes you\nwould say um coma would be the deepest\nstate of right parasympathetic yeah non-\narousal then ascending from you know\nvery you know deeply asleep lightly\nasleep groggy awake uh awake and alert\num awake and alert to the point of being\nyou know highly alert um and then you\nget into kind of uh low-level panic and\nthen allout panic attack right I that's\nkind of the Continuum the autonomic\nContinuum I I feel like if people\nunderstood that and they and they could\nsimply ask okay where where is my body\nand mind along that Continuum and then\ncompare it to whatever it is they face\nthen uh we'd have a better sense of\nwhether or not we were in the correct\nmaybe even optimal state for for dealing\nwith challenge or uh or not and along\nthose lines what is the optimal internal\nstate for dealing with challenge that is\num just outside our ability um you know\nmaybe in an exam where I can naturally\nget 85% of the answers correct but maybe\n15% I think this is what the machine\nlearning and AI tells us is probably the\nappropriate level of difficulty for\nsomething in order to best learn I know\nthat's probably depends on if you're\nmotivated and if you know a lot of\nthings like but yeah I mean I think if\nyou think of the autonomic arousal on\njust one axis\nmhm what where where you start running\ninto problems we find is is that I think\nyou're right that there's like you know\ncoma to like some arousal or meaningful\narousal but the it's the middle to the\nend part where there's two different\ntracks and One Track is very high\narousal but you're terrified of the\ndamage and defeat and the humiliation\nand the failure and so that's that's um\ndemanding all your attention that's what\nwe call threat type stress there's\nanother version that is again very high\narousal but that's like you're stoked\nand you feel confident you're going to\ndo well and that's also very high\narousal and if you just look at arous of\nmeasures like pre-ejection period right\num could you explain pre-ejection period\num it's it's just a it's a simple\nmeasure uh of just the sympathetic\nnervous system that we use in all of our\nstudies so sympathetic just remind folks\nis one aspect of the autonomic nervous\nsystem um has nothing to do with\nsympathy just the more alert means more\nmore contribution of the sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system sorry\nit's a mouthful and then um less alert\nwould be um more contribution of the\nparasympathetic arm of the autonomic\nnervous system and P is just a measure\nthat we use in our laboratory studies um\nand and another could have been like\nskin conductance how it's which is a\nabout the wet coming out of your skin\nand then we use an electrode to figure\nout how much is there um that uh those\nkinds of measures can't distinguish what\nwe call a challenge type State that's\nalmost like people have heard of flow\nwhere you're\noptimally balanced between important\nchallenge you care about and resources\nand ability to you know overcome or at\nleast deal with that challenge on the\npositive side in the other higher rousel\nstate which is threat and that's again\nyou're highly everything's highly\nengaged your whole stress system but you\ndon't think you can deal with it so the\nthat becomes really important because um\nhere's a very practical example if you\nlook at devices people are wearing to\ndetect their stress that might say high\nor low arousal but it can't distinguish\nbetween super good positive challenge\ntype stress and really negative threat\ntype stress one of the examples that\npsychophysiologists like to say a lot I\ngot this from Jeremy Jameson is imagine\nyou're at the top of a double black\ndiamond about to ski down if you are a\ngood skier your heart rate isn't\nprobably low you're probably amped up\nyou're stoked you're like this is\nawesome I can't wait to do this you're\nfully confident you're going to make all\nthe turns and have a\nblast if you're a terrible skier you're\njust imagining the yard sale that's\nabout to happen you're about to crash\nyou're going to fall down the mountain\nyou might die also High arousal if\nyou're wearing like the regular watch\nthat will just detect sympathetic n\nnervous system activation it wouldn't be\nable to tell the difference between\nreally stoked to do something positive\nand terrified of like crashing and dying\nand so we I like that example because\noften in social situations or\nperformance situations you you want to\nbe high arousal to perform your best but\nyou you want your perception of that\ndemand the demand that's requiring your\nbody to respond to be matched with an\nequal belief or what we call appraisal\nof your resource to meet that\ndemand um so I think my answer to the\nquestion is is well I think it's not so\nmuch about what's the optimal amount of\nDemand right so that the\n85% likelihood of success rate problems\nare that's tight trading demand I think\nit's how do you\npair a a necessary level of demand for\nwhatever goal you have with the\nperceptions of the resources and\nsometimes those resources are your\ninternal\nlike just confidence you know or\nsometimes it's your ability to\nreappraise and other times it's material\nresources like do you have a it could be\nin in real life do you have a friend\nthat you could turn to or it might be\nhave you been trained in a way where\nyou're able to overcome this you have\nenough time so resources can be a big\nbucket and that's kind of the magic is\nbecause resources are appraised by the\nmind in our interventions we can give\nyou a different way of viewing your\nresources so that way people feel like\nthey can meet the demand and that pushes\nthem them from a threat type response\ninto a more challenge type response it\nmakes sense if I think that um the\nstress for lack of a better term and the\neffort is going to get me where I need\nto go eventually I'm going to be far\nmore willing to invest the effort yeah\nespecially if I'm motivated I want the I\nwant the thing that lies at the Finish\nLine you basically take the demand which\nwas your intense stress and worry and\nturn it into a resource in your own mind\nand it it turns out that that actually\nhelps people cope at a physiological\nlevel got it got it\num we've been talking a lot about kind\nof the um the nuts and bolts of of\ngrowth mindset and stress is\nperformance-enhancing uh mindset maybe\nwe could um shift a little bit to the\ndiscussion about what you call the\nmentor mindset and and as we do that\nmaybe we'll weave back in some of these\nsome of these Concepts yeah yeah your\nbook 10 to 25 um focuses heavily on uh\nsocial appraisal self appraisal\nbasically the idea that we want to be\nliked and we don't want to be disliked\nand it um and it hurts when people say\nmean things about us or when we hear\nnegative feedback especially if it's\nprovided publicly But ultimately what we\ndo with that information is what\ndetermines you know whether or not we\ngrow and move forward yeah um everyone\nloves a great report card nobody likes a\npoor report card so so um tell us about\nMentor mindset and both for folks in the\n10 to 25 age range but also for\neverybody you know um because it's clear\nthat this impacts us throughout our\nlifespan yeah so the the the work I\nwrite about comes out of a dissertation\nled by Jeff Cohen at Stanford in the 90s\nwith Claude steel and they coined a term\nthat they called the mentors dilemma and\nthe mentors dilemma is the idea that if\nyou're a leader a manager a coach\nteacher whatever it is parent it's very\nhard to simultaneously criticize\nsomebody's work and motivate them to\novercome and embrace that\ncriticism and the reason it's a dilemma\nis\nbecause the leader on the one\nhand wants to maintain high standards by\nbeing critical maybe in order to help\nthe person grow but that could crush the\nperson's motivation the alternative is\nwith withhold your criticism don't say\nthe truth hide all the critical feedback\nand be nice and super\nsupportive but and that meets your goal\nof being friendly and caring but it\ndoesn't help the person grow so it feels\nlike we have to walk through the world\nstuck between two bad choices either\nyou're a demanding autocratic you know\ndictator who care doesn't care about\nhuman feelings or you are a like low\nstandards wimp pushover that that's you\nknow giving in to the like wimpy demands\nof the weak Next Generation and neither\nof those have uniformly positive\nconnotations and the classic example in\nJeff's work was a student at Stanford\nwho writes a first draft of an essay and\nthen gets really harsh critical feedback\nfrom a professor are they willing to\nrevise their work or do they say this\nteacher hates me they're biased I\ndislike them and leave the leave the\ncomments\nunaddressed so the solution to that in\nin that research on the mentors dilemma\nhas been to say two things one is appeal\nto the very high standard you have for\nsomeone's work but also always accompany\nthat appeal to the high standard with an\nassurance that if they implement the\nfeedback and use the support that\nthey're capable of meeting the high\nstandard I like to think of it as like\nif you go to the roller coaster and they\nsay you have to be this tall to ride\nright so just saying you have to be this\ntall and you're not see you later isn't\nreassuring to somebody right but if you\ncan say here's the standard and I\nbelieve you can meet it but it's going\nto be hard that means a lot it means I'm\ntaking you\nseriously um it means I like believe in\nyour growth and it's a kind of\nleadership practice that makes growth\nmindset be something that comes to life\nand feel true it's not just an idea in\nyour head that you're growing it's like\nI live in a social world where people\nare going to push me to grow and not\nleave me alone are you familiar with the\num book of the late I think the\npronunciation is Randy P for the last\nlecture no he was a computer scientist\nhe developed a lot of um early online um\nportals for kids in particular um uh\nyoung women to learn programming I think\nit was called Alice um uh and he is\nknown for what called the last lecture\nhe was diagnosed with cancer he\neventually passed away but he talked\nabout um in his book um lessons that\nwere important for life and one of the\nthings that he said was um the the thing\nto worry about is not when your mentors\nand coaches um are pushing you it's when\nthey stop pushing you that you should\nreally worry because that means they've\nbasically given up on you right so that\nalways that always rung in my in my mind\nyeah that what what I call the the\nperson who just is is no longer\nmaintaining high standards for you I\ncall that a protector mindset that it's\nit's almost like it's going to be too\nmuch trouble to see you dealing with\nstress from being pushed that I am going\nto protect you from that stress I I\nmaybe I care about you but I'm not going\nto not going to hold you to a high\nstandard and I see that a lot um in\ncoaches I see it in teachers I see it in\nparents um for me the the opposite\nproblematic version is what I call an\nenforcer mindset this is like here's the\nstandard\nand I'm going to hold you to it and it's\nup to you to meet it or not right that's\nkind of like the college professor that\nsays look to your left look to your\nright half of you you know are going to\nbe gone by the end of this um for me the\nsolution is to think about taking the\nbest parts of both of those two what's\nthe high standards High support So\nenforcer great you've got the standards\nlet's add your support protector you\ncare a lot great let's add the standards\nand what Jeff Cohen and Claud steel\nfound in their initial study is that\nstudents were far more likely to view\nnegative criticism as a sign that the\nteacher cared for them if it was\naccompanied by a transparent and clear\ncommunication of these two elements of\nhigh standards and high support if it\nwas just the critical feedback the\nprofessor could have meant the same\npositive thing I'm caring about you but\nthey didn't make it clear to the person\nthen then participants were less likely\nto think that the that that the\nprofessor was on their side in an artwor\nin some small studies we um we showed\nthat even seventh graders when they get\ncritical feedback on their essays are\nabout twice as likely to implement the\nteachers's critical feedback with even a\nvery short invocation of the high\nstandards and the high\nsupport So to get to your question about\nMentor mindset at some\npoint I got worried that our experiment\non high standards High support messages\nwhich we called wise feedback in those\nstudies would be viewed as um I don't\nknow like a magic phrase like I my joke\nmy laugh Line This is a lame laugh line\nbut I'm a professor so that's the best I\ncan do my laugh line was always I just\nlive in fear that Pearson and other\ntextbook companies are going to sell\nwise feedback posted notes say they can\nmagically erase the achievement Gap\nright and I always said that as a joke\nand then two things happen one is a\npopular author a guy named Dan Coyle\nliterally called it magic Fe back in his\nbook didn't site us but like you didn't\nsight us no\nDan but also like magic Fe I'll say it\nso you don't have to not cool\nattribution is important it's just not\nit's not magic at all the the the magic\nof high standards and high support is\nnot the 18 words it's I'm taking you\nseriously when a moment When You're\nvulnerable and I have power over\nyou that is just so deeply human and so\npowerful but there's nothing about the\nmagic words it's\nthe it's the experience of dignity and\nrespect when you are questioning whether\nyou are either worthy of it or going to\nbe given it by authorities it's\ninteresting we had um Dr Becky Kennedy\non here to talk about parenting yeah and\nshe said um many important things but\namong them was the fact that um children\nperhaps all people want to feel real\nyeah and they want to feel safe yeah um\nan important concept that I think many\npeople heard and and are really\ninternalizing I I know I am um for sure\nand this idea of feeling real has to do\nwith um not just feeling seen but that U\npeople believe us even if they disagree\nwith us yeah like they they believe us\nshe has another thing that's super\nprofound is uh the the kind of two\nthings argument that I can both have\nhigh expectations for my kids and love\nmy kids and I think that's a very good\nversion of wise feedback Mentor mindset\nthat as parents it either feels like I\ncan expect a lot of my kids but then I'm\na monster and they're going to yell at\nme or I'm going to be a pushover and\nthen they're going to be unruly and I\nthink part of her wisdom is to help\nexplain to parents how you can do both\nof those things and indeed one can right\nI think but it requires having a kind of\ndynamic stance or dynamic mindset as the\nthe teacher the leader the the coach the\nparent I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors\nwaking up waking up is a meditation app\nthat offers hundreds of guided\nmeditations mindfulness trainings yoga\nneeder sessions and more I started\nmeditating over three decades ago and\nwhat I found in the insing years is that\nsometimes it was very easy for me to do\nmy daily meditation practice I was just\nreally diligent but then as things would\nget more stressful which of course is\nexactly when I should have been\nmeditating more my meditation practice\nwould fall off with waking up they make\nit very easy to find and consistently\nuse a given meditation practice it has\nvery convenient reminders and they come\nin different durations so even if you\njust have one minute or five minutes to\nmeditate you can still get your\nmeditation in which research shows is\nstill highly beneficial in addition to\nthe many different meditations on the\nwaking up app they also have yoga Nedra\nsessions which are a form of non-sleep\ndeep rest that I personally find is\nextremely valuable for restoring mental\nand physical Vigor I tend to do a Yoga\nNidra lasting anywhere from 10 to 20\nminutes at least once a day and if I\never wake up in the middle of the night\nand I need to fall back asleep I also\nfind Yoga Nidra to be extremely useful\nif you'd like to try the waking up app\nyou can go to waking up.com huberman to\ntry a free 30-day trial again that's\nwaking up.com huberman I want to get\nback to some of the the mechanics of had\nto go about that but why do you think\nthis stuff is so hard like like if we\nthink about um I don't know kind of a\ncurbside\nevolutionary uh Theory um meaning I\ndon't have any formal training in\nevolutionary psychology you could step\nback and say like I don't know maybe we\njust used to be so busy from morning to\nsleep that we didn't really have time to\ndo anything except the stuff we needed\nto complete in order to feed our\nfamilies and take care of our our\ncommunities Etc and and now a number of\nthings are outsourced and um and so here\nwe have this notion of strivings but\nthen again you know we went from Hunter\ngather uh culture to writing war in\npeace and everything else um\nTechnologies of all kinds so you know\nthere must be something in the human\nbrain that um causes us to strive and\nwhat we're really talking about here is\nstriving in our relationship with\nstriving um so if we were to step back\nand just say\nokay what do you think determines\nwhether or not someone uh feels they can\ndo better is it early success you know I\nthey tried at something I mean everyone\nmost everyone I assume who tries to\nlearn to walk walks um learns to speak\nspeaks you know they're rare exceptions\nbut um you know what do you think this\nwhole thing about strivings is about and\nwhen we talk about growth mindset\nstresses enhancing mindset the mentor\nmindset um I mean are we trying to get\nback to activating systems that are\nhardwired within us and that have been\nkind of um masked by daily life um or\nare we trying to kind of better\nourselves and our species through you\nknow like really trying to do something\nthat's never been done in human history\nbefore right it's a big it's a big\nquestion it's a big question but I mean\nI think that that all I can do is\nconjecture you know as a scientist but\nthe um I'm often reminded of something I\nheard from Ron doll who's a\nneuroscientist at Berkeley and not\nRonald doll the the children's not rald\ndoll Ron Ron doll although Ron is just\njust so such an awesome guy it's like\njust polymath who can do everything and\njust so curious and generous uh he uh\nwhat he always says to me is like look\nis like David what do you think the\nhuman brain wants to do like I I don't\nknow feel good he's like no wants to\nfeel better and I think what he was\ntrying to get me to see is that it's the\nkind of pursuit of some kind of Delta um\nand a change yeah a change from the\nstate and and I think the argument is\nthat even if you are if what you thought\nwas your biggest need if that was\nsatisfied then there's always like\nanother thing I think as part of the\nargument and\nso but it's also this idea that if you\nthink of the human brain as trying to\nlearn at all times like what is it\ntrying to learn and the at least in the\nanimal studies as you know often it's\nlike how do I either feel better or\navoid you know feeling worse in a lot of\nways and I think that as I think about\nadolescence that's a period where your\ntheory of how to feel better is\ndramatically changing because you're no\nlonger fully cared for by adults right\nall of a sudden your criteria for\nfeeling good about yourself is your\nsocial standing not just in your parents\neyes but in the eyes of the community\nand the mill you you're a part of and\nand that comes a lot from your\ncontribution value if you think in our\nevolutionary history like the being\nostracized and alone is certain death in\nancient human culture\nright I mean you can't the tribes\nwandering around in the savannah you're\nalone at a minimum you have no one to\nwatch out for you when you fall asleep\nand so and you humans can't sleep in\ntrees because our muscles aren't don't\ncontract when we're uh asleep unlike\nanimals and so you're just Exposed on\nthe ground if you're alone eventually\nyou're going to die right so the the\nfear of moving from a parents taking\ncare of your safety all night to now you\nhave to trust peers to take care of you\nand watch over you\nthat comes to the Forefront of young\npeople's minds like kind of the minute\npuberty strikes and so what it means to\nfeel better often is that I'm socially\nvalued by the group there's something\nthey're going to keep me around for some\nreason now they don't often keep score\nin an explicit way I mean now things are\non social media maybe they're kind of\nkeeping score but like the rules of how\nyou're doing socially are so implicit\nyou have to read between the lines\nthey're inferred social hierarchy is\nvery complex for adolescence\nand so they overdo it thinking\nthrough like how how am I standing like\nwhere am I relative to others now that\nprocess is started by puberty and we\nknow from lots of species work that it\nthen leads to changes in the brain so\nthe dop energic system of course is like\ndriven in part by changes in Gad\nmaturation Ron likes to talk about these\ngreat studies of song birds of how do\nthey learn the meeting calls\nand if song birds don't have\ntestosterone when they are learning the\nmating calls they don't do the like\nover-the-top obsessive practice so they\ndon't Master them and then they don't M\nand they die alone interesting yeah I'm\nfamiliar with that um with that\nliterature there's a great uh\nunfortunately now passed away uh\nbiologist who was first in the UK and\nthen uh was up at UC Davis uh Peter\nmaror and who studied the U the bird\nsong learning yeah and it's it's um it's\namazing yeah it's amazing work and it\nmimics a lot of the uh the development\nof human speech although not exactly\nlike there's this babbling phase yeah\nwhere babies and birds experiment with\ndifferent to tones and they're they're\nlearning to use the fings and larynx or\nyou know in Birds it's a slightly\ndifferent system yeah and some birds are\nseasonal singers but I I wasn't familiar\nwith this result that the testosterone\ndrives a kind of obsessive uh practice\nYeah it's obessive practice in order to\ndemonstrate well status but really your\nvalue I mean there it's mate value right\nright but I think the same thing is true\nfor lots of things that teenagers trial\ncould be playing guitar you know uh\ncould be gymnastics I mean think about\nhow many of their Olympic athletes are\nlike 14 right and they're waking up at 4\nin the morning they're practicing\nobsessively how many like pro-social\nhackers who take down evil foreign\ngovernments right are teenagers right\nthere things that that take so much\npractice and so much learning happen at\nthe exact same age as adults are saying\nthese kids are lazy and don't want to\nwork right so I tend to focus on get to\nyour question about why do people strive\nto get better I think in adolescence you\nlook around in your social millu and see\nwhat counts for status not in a\nsuperficial way it sometimes happen but\noften in a deeply meaningful way what am\nI going to bring to the table one would\nhope and then well I remember Junior\nHigh School being far more superficial\nbut I'm 48 so I remembered it in the\nkind of the John Hughes film era where\npeople were very divided in terms of\njocks and skateboarders and rockers and\nnerds now it seems a little bit more\nMish mashed um but I think also people\nwill uh in adolescence I feel like um\nkids find their Niche and then try and\nExcel within that Niche yeah you know as\nopposed to high school or Junior High\nSchool being um one huge hierarchy yeah\nyou know there's kind of these sub\nhierarchies yeah Dan McFarland is a\nsociologist at Stanford did this really\ninteresting study with the ad Health\nData and you turns out you could\ncharacteriz the social hierarchies in\ndifferent high schools by kind of single\npyramid high schools versus multi-\npyramid high schools and there's way\nbetter adjustment in the multi- pyramid\nhigh schools because there's many roots\nto status The evolutionary psychologist\nBruce Ellis talks about having many\nroles and I I like that because in the\nold model you know if if there's one\npyramid and you're kind of near the top\nbut not at the top you've got a lot of\nincentive to destroy reputations be you\nknow Mean Girls type of behavior\num Bob Ferris sociologist at Davis finds\nthat the most bullying in high school is\nthe people that are like the 6th to 85th\npercentile on popularity it's like\nyou're near the top but not all the way\nat the top yeah this Maps very well to\nRobert spolsky's work on primate troops\nyeah yeah the alphas are stressed but\nthe the sub Alphas are they have options\nyeah um and this is true for female and\nmale animals um just as it's true we\nwere talking about testosterone a few\nminutes ago an obsessive practice\nI'll remind people that um in women uh\nthey actually have more adult women have\nmore testosterone than they do estrogen\nif you look at a pure nanogram per\ndeciliter comparison it's just that\noverall it tends to be on average less\nthan in men so the the statement about\ntestosterone and obsessive um uh\nlearning uh or efforts to learn it I\nhave to imagine is not restricted to\nmales or females and I think I\nunderstand as a man praising\ntestosterone that I could come across\nbut I I so I always need to remember\nthat the research is is very interesting\non\nt uh Evelyn Crohn's lab um did these\ngreat studies where they had kids\nstarting age 10 to like 25 and they had\nthem come in the lab twice and they took\ntestosterone levels but also had them do\na bunch of tasks in the scanner and you\ncan look at nucleus incumbant prefrontal\ncortex Etc areas associated with reward\nyeah yeah and pursuit motivation yeah\nyeah and um and they also have them do\nrisk-taking tasks and what they find is\nthat in both boys and girls testosterone\ngoes up over time starts a little\nearlier in girls because going to Ary is\none or two years before boys but the\nchange score from one point to the next\nwas equally predictive of neural\nreactivity during risk-taking tasks for\nboth boys and girls so although boys end\nup with higher tea throughout\nadolescence um the the increase is\nequally predictive which is another way\nof saying it's just as important for\nthese social learning things in girls\nand and T by the way is just a a really\ntestosterone testosterone is a really\ngood proxy other hormones are involved\ntoo they're just more complicated like\nDHEA you could um study as well but\nthat's part of the same metabolic\npathway of cortisol and testosterone so\nit's just Messier and harder to\ninterpret so it's not we're not making\nclaims specifically about testosterone\nit's just like a really good proxy for\nwhere you are in gonat maturation in\nboth boys and girls gonat maturation\nreally matters for this kind of status\nsocial seeking part of your brain yeah\nso if I understand correctly the slope\nof the line of one's uh testosterone\nincrease for both boys and girls is\npredictive of striving if it's a steep\nupward you know yeah line then then that\nthat's associated with more striving in\na given practice to the extent that like\nneural activation during a social reward\ntask or a risk-taking task is a proxy\nfor striving and and that's what that's\nwhat a lot of people have argued yeah do\nyou think that striving reflects the\naction of a you know kind of a basic\nneural circuit that then can be applied\nto other things um or lots of different\nthings the reason I ask is that you know\nthe the notion of growth mindset is so\nattractive it's such a sticky idea um\nbecause or I think because one imagines\nokay if I can get really good at one\nthing chess then I can apply the same\nkind of relationship to the internal\nstate of stress or arousal or what have\nyou when trying to navigate a new a new\nenvironment of another kind a physical\npractice or a relationship challenge or\nsomething of that sort that that you\nknow what we're really talking about\nhere is an algorithm that can be\ndirected at different uh Pursuits as\nopposed to growth mindset is applied in\none context and not another um so what\nwhat of that um people who are\nincredibly good at accessing growth\nmindset in one domain of life does that\nmean that they'll be good at accessing\ngross mindset in another domain of Life\nwhat's the the um the carryover or the\nspill over it's a great question it\ncomes up a lot um the Michigan State\npsychologist Jason moer studied this and\nthey measured growth mindset about your\nintelligence the classic one your\npersonality your morality your social\nrelationships your emotions Etc and the\nquestion is is there kind of like one\ngrowth mindset that applies in all the\ndifferent ways\nor are\nthere totally narrow mindsets that have\nnothing to do with each other or is it\nsomething in between and the finding was\nthat there is an overall Association if\nyou think one trait can change and be\ndeveloped you tend to think another\ntrait can be changed and developed and\njust empirically it's hard to separate\nthat from people's General tendency to\ndisagree or agree with items that could\nbe what the common factor is but it kind\nof makes sense however\nthere's also very domain specific\nmindsets so there are people who think\nyeah I can get smarter but I can't\nchange my shyness and other people who\nthink my relationships are never going\nto get better but I can learn to play\nthe cello you know and vice versa and\nwhen you want to predict Behavior turns\nout that the closer you are to that\ndomain the better the prediction is\ngoing to be so if I want to know if\nyou're going to quit playing the cello\nor not I'm going to ask you your cello\nmindset said that's going to do way\nbetter than in general can human\nqualities change but if I'm going to\nintervene at what level should the\nintervention happen if I only change\nyour cello mindset well you're right\nlike what if cello isn't your thing in\nlife now are you going to be fixed\nmindset for your relationships in school\nand that I not really help you so um\nthe kind of the empirical answer\ncurrently is if it's a domain that\nsomeone could be really defensive about\nit's better to be a little vaguer about\nit classic example is Iran how parents\nwork on the Israel Palestine conflict\nwhich is obviously a big issue right now\ntheir science paper in\n2011 changed mindsets about group\nconflict in\ngeneral can an ethnic group or a\nnational group ever change they didn't\ngo to people in Israel and say\nPalestinians can change cuz they're like\nno they can't that's not it's not\npossible\nbut if they said you know sometimes\nleaders change and When leaders change\nthe group's priorities change and they\nbecome more amenable to negotiation and\nwhen that happens things can change if\nthat was done at a more General level\nthen both Israelis and Palestinians were\nmore open to a peace\nprocess so I think if it's something\nyou're very defensive about I I tend to\nthink back up and do the more abstract\nmindset another example is I remember I\nwas in graduate school at Stanford\nand one of my raas was so excited about\nour work and he went to a party and\ntalked about it it's like that very\nStanford thing to do as talk about\nresearch at a party and he's like oh\nyeah math ability can change you don't\nhave to be done with math forever and\nthe person he talked to was so offended\nshe was like are you telling me I could\nhave done better in high school math and\nI just didn't try hard enough and my\nlife could be different I could be an\nengineer right now like I like my life\nwhy are you telling it was it went down\nthis road of like how dare you tell me\nit could have been different\nand I who knows maybe he had bad\ndelivery and had 14 margaritas and\nthat's who knows what happened but I\nthink the idea is like if if someone's\ngot a reason\nto think about that fixed mindset\nas comforting in some way that they\ndon't have to feel bad about something\nthat could have been different it's\nprobably not smart to go after that in a\nvery specific way but if someone's not\ndefensive generally the the closer to\nthe domain the better because they're\ngoing to see the application otherwise\nthey have to use it by analogy and an we\nknow analogic reasoning is is tough cuz\nit's Hit or Miss we love stories of\npeople that have come from a place of\nbeing really back on their heels um or\neven just dissolved into a puddle of\ntheir own tears too uh doing well again\nmaybe even soaring again it's sort of\nthe the the common thing is that this is\nthe the classic American uh story\nalthough it's true of people all over\nthe world I imagine right it's not\nalways true in America either but yeah\nright some people yeah some people crash\nand burn but it seems like everybody\nloves a comeback story right I know\nsomething about that um the the uh the\nhero's journey the the um hero of a\nthousand faes is that the that's the\nJoseph Campbell um yeah um and it's\nwritten into so many movies and books\nand and real life uh uh stories I can't\nhelp but superimpose today's discussion\nonto something like that right that um\nyou know that life is a series of um\nefforts to apply growth mindset from\nlearning how to walk right presumably is\npart of that right I don't know any\nchild that just stands up and walks um\nearly on to to the things that we we\nreally think uh we can perform well at\nto um finding ourselves like really back\non our heels and and so are there any\ndata um or theories even that point to\nthe use of growth mindset and stress is\nenhancing mindset in coming from a real\nplace of deficit not just from trying to\ndo better and learn new things but from\na real place of deficit a real place of\nchallenge I think it's important for our\naudience to hear because I think a\nnumber of people do feel back on their\nheels um in one or more domains of life\nyeah it's a good question I mean I think\nthat the data suggests that growth\nmindset becomes most relevant to your\nnext Behavior the more challenge you\nface and so for a long time what that\nmeant is if you maybe we're a low\nachieving student and we're going to and\nwe're going to evaluate growth mindset\nby looking at your grades you should see\nbigger gains for low achieving students\ncompared to high achieving students part\nof that could be an artifact if you\nalready have straight A's we can't give\nyou more A's it's impossible right but\num you know in in general psychological\ntreatments like a growth mindset tend to\nwork better for people who\ncounterfactually wouldn't have them and\ncould plausibly benefit from them where\nthe story becomes more interesting is\nthat often your kind of own individual\ndifficulties are associated with your\nenvironment and the environment is\nreally what allows you to apply your\ngrowth mindset over time so it might\nmight make you right now need a growth\nmindset more but it might make it harder\nfor you to act on\nit and so the for people who like\ncomplex three-way interactions the idea\nis that a treatment for growth mindset\nshould work best for individuals who\nface the most challenges but are in the\nmost supportive environments and one is\nlike Baseline why do you need it and the\nother is over time what's going to help\nyou keep using it so to be very concrete\nabout this in uh in one paper we\npublished in\n2019 uh the national study of learning\nmindsets it was published in nature\nwe evaluated growth mindset in this\nlarge National sample and the the\nquestion wasn't does it work on average\nthe question was where does it work and\nfor whom as we had there were lots of\nreplications already and and sometimes\npeople tried it and like well didn't\nwork here okay well what's that's a\npuzzle how do we figure that out and the\nfinding was low achieving students in\nhigh schools um that had more supportive\nclassroom culture where you got where\nyou got the long run effects and in the\nin the in the four-year results it's low\nachieving students in high schools that\noffered more advanced courses so if\nyou're a low achieving student you go\nwith mindset it's like great give me\npre-cal\noh we don't offer that here right or\nit's a toxic environment in some way the\nteachers are untrained they're first\nyear teachers there's lots of poverty in\nthe school if you don't have the\nstructure to support the striving you\ndon't get the long run effects\nespecially if the effects you're looking\nat are increases in equality of\nopportunity so for me the message is\nlike you think about growth mindset and\npsychological interventions as one tool\nin a toolkit to help people achieve\ntheir goals\nbut we can't forget about the entire\nfield of Sociology that tells us a lot\nabout the allocation of resources\nthrough which people can even be\nafforded the chance to pursue their\ngoals and so what I like about that\nfinding which by the way came from a\ncollaboration with sociologists who\nthought you psychologists are absurd\nthey're like you think your little\nmindset is going to like change\ninequality like you're going to make an\nargument to 15-year-olds and that's your\nplan for improving the American economy\nthat's absurd\nI was like well I don't know might it\ncould do something and uh psychologists\nare skeptical sociologists they're like\nlook how how often do we have huge\nchanges in law and policy but people\ndon't don't take advantage of the\nresources that are available to them\nlet's change the behavior so they take\nadvantage we kind of came together and\nsaid what does it look like to consider\nboth the structure and the internal\npsychology and I think this was a very\nimportant point because people tend to\nchoose one or the other together either\nwe're going to lobby for new laws to\nreallocate resources or we're going to\noptimize the psychology of the\nindividual and I think our perspective\nis to find ways to bring those two\ntogether and kind of do\nboth um and ultimately it's not a\ndeficit-based perspective of you have a\ndeficit and we're fixing that growth\nmindset is more like well it's an asset\nbased perspective what I mean by that\nis we're not giving someone motivation\nin growth mindset\nwe're presuming people already kind of\nwant to do well they want to impress\nothers they want to be meaningful they\nwant to contribute but there's a barrier\nthe barrier is when you strive and then\ninevitably struggle if you're pushing\nyourself beyond your abilities people\nmake you feel dumb for that\nstruggle so we are we're trying to\nremove that cultural and social barrier\nthat's preventing people from their\nnatural goal Pursuit and and that comes\ndeeply from Carol D's original work at\nthe intersection of Developmental and\nSocial Psychology the basic claim in\ndevelopmental psychology is the human\nbeing is an active learner who's trying\nto figure out the world right this is\nclassic Allison kopnick you know Susan\nGman infants are meaning makers trying\nto interpret the world and wanting to do\nwell and eventually they're socialized\ninto beliefs that prevent them from\nacting on that basic neural desire to\nlearn grow develop ET\nand and growth mindset is really it's\nnot trying to be a magic pill to give an\nunmotivated disaffected kid a shot in\nthe arm of adrenaline so they go out and\nlearn no it presumes agency and love of\nlearning and kind of like Dr Becky said\npresumes the goodness in kids and tries\nto remove whatever kind of garbage\nbeliefs they've learned from social\ncontext and then our long-term studies\nthen show how\nyou once you do that if they're also in\na context where you can act on that love\nof learning then you can see long run\neffects that are far more than what a\nlot of people have said you could get\neven in even a disadvantaged\ncontext it's so interesting because what\nwe're talking about here is\npsychological theory playing out in the\nreal world but also um kind of like no\ndeep Notions of the human Spirit like we\nare a species that um seems to organize\nour experience in terms of of stories of\nourselves and others but that um when it\ncomes to things like strivings and\nlearning um are really always in a\nconstant state of either being more to\nborrow the words of a friend of mine\neither back on our heels flat footed or\nforward Center of mass right um and what\nwe're talking about today is being\nforward Center of mass at least in\ncertain areas of life I mean that the\nfact that the reward systems of the\nbrain where you mentioned them earlier\nthese misol liic reward Pathways that\nbasically deploy dopamine um and other\nthings of course um are so associated\nwith striving and achieving striving and\nachieving and presumably underly much if\nnot all of our human evolution assuming\nwe're still evolving lately sometimes I\nwonder but um some people would argue\nwe're Devol devolving but I I would\nargue we're still evolving um especially\nwith this new burst in AI it's all about\nmath nowadays folks a few years ago it\nall about neuroscience and Neuroscience\nis still really important and the two\nshare but it's all about math lately um\nso I I like to just think of the human\nanimal as so different than the other\nanimals of the planet like we're the\ncurators of the planet the house cats\nmight be striving but they're clearly\nnot doing as well as we are in terms of\nmanaging the way the world goes so what\ndo you think that this is like a basic\num algorithm within human beings\nto look at ourselves look at the\nenvironment see challenges overcome\nchallenges develop Technologies it's\njust kind of like a a it's like the same\nway my bulldog used to like to gnaw on\nthings you know you like to chew and\npull we just want to learn and grow do\nyou do you think it's inherent to who we\nare as a species maybe even what sets\nour species apart from all the others I\nmean that's that's a profound question I\nthink that's that's a good one to debate\nthat what what I've been really taken by\nrecently is Carol dak's Secret Life as a\nneuroscientist she has this great psych\nreview\npaper\nthat contradicts a lot of received\nwisdom about prefrontal planning regions\nof the brain and the kind of amydala and\nthe hippocampus the you know the\naffective regions and the memory\ncreation regions and the the classic\nargument and going back to Plato and the\nfadis right is that the rational acting\npart of the brain plans out what it\nwants makes all these calculations and\nthen has to tame the emotional part in\norder to make those goals into a reality\nand so the emotion you know the amydala\nthe\nmesolimbic that's this unruly horse that\nthe Chariot has to harness you know and\nI think that Carol argued and I think\nother people have argued too I've I've\nseen Adriana Galvan and rondall and\nothers argue this that\num the affective regions are often the\nteacher and the prefontal is the student\nand that makes sense if you think about\nhow humans are goal directed think about\nhow a kid learns to walk they don't do\nthat for theoretical reasons they don't\njust like look at people walking and be\nlike I want to learn how to do that\nright it's I have four kids it's usually\nbecause there's a toy at the other side\nof the room that they really really want\nand that I don't want them to have and\nthe only way for them to go get it\nbecause I won't get it for them is for\nthem to learn how to walk so the the\nmotor learning is the effect of the\ndesire in the goal Pursuit and what what\nCarol argued is that\nfeder's had is totally wrong it's not\nthat the prefrontal charioteer is taming\nthe emotional it's really that the the\naffect part is training the prefrontal\nto be better at pursuing the goals that\nmatter in the social millu that you have\nand a lot of people like um Adriana\nGalvan and Jen feifer and Nim Tottenham\nin the Adolescent space have shown this\nand I don't understand all the details\nfully but the the argument that I've\nheard is that once the scanning studies\nwere able to switch from fmri focused on\nsimple activation to studies looking at\nconnectivity then they and where you\ncould get temporal ordering then you\ncould start seeing actually that\nespecially in adolescence it's the the\naffective regions are training or\nteaching or telling the prefrontal\nregions what to do so I guess the the\nthat's a long way of answering the\nquestion of I think that I think goal\nPursuit is fundamental to Human Nature\nand I think that the brain and our\nadaptation is designed to help us learn\nhow to be a lot better at pursuing\nwhatever goals will help us survive in\nour environment and the brain has to be\nadaptive to that environmental input\nbecause the environment's always\nchanging if it had only one way of\npursuing its goals then we would never\nsurvive so it has to be the case that\nthe planning rational observing part of\nthe brain is actually responsive to what\nworks in your context for goal Pursuit\nso again I'm summarizing other people's\nhere but that's how I that's how I see\nit yeah I completely agree that emotions\nDrive the more um let's call tactical\ncircuitry of the prefrontal cortex of\ncourse we should be fair to the the\nNeuroscience the prefrontal cortex is\npart of the lyic system people often\nthink because it's in the cortex it's\nhigher order and um that's simply not\ntrue but um well if we both agree and it\nsounds like we do that emotions Drive\ntactical decisions that drive action and\nlearning\num maybe we could talk about the two\nmajor types of emotions um that one\ncould imagine one is um I really want\nthe toy I really want the piece of food\nI really need um something for survival\nor for well-being and so I'm going to be\nbe motivated and then the prefrontal\ncortex will work out the strategies and\num balance out the relationship to\nstress Etc and remind ourselves that\nstress can be performance- enhancing and\neventually we we we get the thing or the\nskill or the whatever the other would be\num fear fear of social shame fear of\nstaying in a place that's not good for\nus financially emotionally socially Etc\num is there any work that um identifies\nwhether or not the the core emotion\ndriving motivation is relevant and is\nthere role for growth mindset\nthere that's interesting um I guess it\nput simply um take it down out of the\nIvory Tower a little bit which is what\nwe're doing here anyway um you can do\nthings out of love you can do things out\nof fear you do for both reasons too yeah\num you can do things to um please\nyourself you can do things to please\nothers you can do things to avoid others\nbeing disappointed in you you being\ndisappointed in yourself presumably it's\nboth yeah but are is there any um I'm\ndying for you to tell me that when we do\nthings out of love we learn faster but\nmaybe that's not the case well I don't\nknow I mean so two thoughts one is just\nyou know honoring Danny conoman who just\npassed away\nhis work with Amos tersi took on a\nversion of this question in prospect\ntheory and it's the idea of does the\ndoes the fear of a loss motivate us more\nthan the prospect of a gain right and\ntheir argument is that both can be\nmotivating as well as the possibility of\na loss but that losses Loom larger that\npeople are more willing to take a risky\ngamble to prevent a loss than they are\nto get a numerically equal like a\nmathematically equal gain um and so a\nlot of people have used that information\nin various ways and and I think that\nthat has led people to conclude that the\nprospect of a gain doesn't mean anything\nbut that really wasn't ever the point in\nprospect theory it's just that it's a\nlittle more powerful to to avoid a to be\nafraid of a loss it's honestly a problem\nwith with thinking like yeah losses are\na little worse you know if I already had\n$1,000 and you took it away feels a\nlittle worse than the chance to win a\nthousand I didn't win mathematically\nit's the same Delta um but uh but but I\nthink that the way that behavioral\neconomic work gets applied is to appeal\nto people's kind of basist and most you\nknow fearful responses to things and if\nyou think about what what drives a lot\nof\nexcellence in in moral examp\ntoo um it it's this chance to feel like\nyou've made a big contribution to others\nand and I don't think people are afraid\nthat they didn't help as many people as\nthey could have and maybe that drives\nsome people but I think just the the\naffective forecasting of uh one day I'll\nfeel good because of the meaningful work\nI did for others that was high integrity\nwhen no one else would have seen it you\nknow that I think I think that's really\nmotivating for a lot of people and I\nthink we underappreciate that and\ntherefore we appeal to very narrow\nself-interest and and my my favorite\ntheorist on this is Dale Miller is at\nthe Stanford Business school and he\ncalls it the norm of self-interest that\nif you look around it looks like\neveryone's behaving for only uh very\nnarrow short-term self-interested\nreasons and because you think that's the\nnorm then you yourself kind of respond\nto those incentives and then you then\ninter turn create that Norm even more\nthat other people see but it's not a\nstate of affairs that anybody really\nlikes everybody kinds of prefers a\npro-social world where people are\nhelping others but if you think that's\njust a really weird thing to do and not\nnormal then people conform to the wrong\nNorm so in my work what I try to\nemphasize is is not that we're not\nafraid of losses and and the narrow\nshort-term gain that you know that we're\navoiding uh or the short-term loss we're\navoiding but like I I really do think\nthat people are capable of far more like\nbeautiful contributions to the world\nwhen\nwe assume that that's what they want and\nwe create opportunities for them to do\nthat I've seen that so much um if you\nlook at some of the best managers right\nit's it's not just if you screw up\nyou're going to lose your bonus like\nthat's not what the best managers in the\nworld are doing right they're like let's\ndo something no one's ever done before\nlet me support you to do it and then let\nme make sure that you look awesome in\nfront of all the senior vice presidents\nbecause you did that like that's what\nthe best managers do and coaches too\nthis uh for my book I interviewed the\nNBA's best shooting\ncoach this uh basketball player uh named\nShane Bader who played college in pro\nbasketball told me about him and I\ninterviewed chip England is his name and\nhe was at the San Antonio Spurs which\nthey had a 17-year run of being a\nperennial Contender for the\nchampionships and constantly drafted\nplayers\nwho were talented but had a bad jump\nshot so Kawhi Leonard is in example\nwhere fell late in the first round\nbecause people thought Couldn't Shoot\nTony Parker is another example when Tony\nParker used to shoot Greg papovich would\nsay that's a turnover every time chip\nEngland is the a great shooting coach\nworked with them there's lots of Bill\nBarnwell had a great story about him\ncalled him the shot doctor and I\ninterviewed chip and I was like chip how\ndo you sell the vision to these players\nwho are 18 to 21 are Newfound\nmillionaires everyone's saying you're\nthe best you're a first rounder and they\ndon't want to change their shot because\nif they\ndo they could mess it up make it worse\nit's like a golfer superstitious about\ntheir shot and he's like you know the\nthe number one thing I have to do is\nbuild trust because I can't critique a\nplayer shot and make them change it if\nthey think they're going to sacrifice\nmore so he's like Dave the first thing\nyou have to do is sell your vision I was\nlike well what's your vision he's\nlike he doesn't say if you don't change\nyour shot you are going to lose millions\nof dollars and be out of the league so\nit's he doesn't motivate with the fear\nof loss he\nsays the average time in the league is\ntwo and a half years right if you\ndevelop a great reliable jump shot where\neven as your athletic talents decline\nyou're still reliable you're talking\nabout a 10-year career and then you're\nnot just helping you you're not just\nhelping your family you're helping your\nfamily's\nfamily so even in the like money\nobsessed cutthoat world of professional\nsports the single best coach working\nwith the top players appeals to the\nprospect of what you could do for others\nnot the fear of loss and to me that's\nreally telling like if if it worked to\njust motivate with the fear of loss\nthat's what he would do because they\nwould do whatever is effective it's a\nlike at some level an efficient market\nbut that's not what chip England does\nand I think the same is true for a lot\nof other great mentors and leaders so if\nI understand\ncorrectly when we find\nourselves back on our heels or\nflat-footed we want to focus on the\nprospect of what we can do for others\nlike ultimately that's going to be the\nbest um or the world yeah or the world\nyeah I guess yeah pick your um pick your\nscope of impact could be for art for\nintellectual history it's it's a classic\nVictor Frankle argument of man search\nfor meaning right as the as Victor\nfrankl's leaving the the concentration\ncamps what helps him\nsurvive and it's the debt that he owes\nto the Future work that he wants to\nwrite to share with the world and it's\nnot it's not the fear of death it's the\nthe meaning of the work he could do for\nthe world if he\nsurvives yeah I think um I'd like to\nhover on this for a minute or two\nbecause I think it's really important I\nrealize we're getting more philosophical\nthan operational but we have data on\nthis it's a um yeah I I'd love to hear\nit that's one of the things I'm really\nenjoying about this conversation the\nmoment I think it's going to be abstract\nor or that you've got uh you got it all\nthere in in in that brain um yeah let's\ntalk about this the pro uh that when\nwhen we feel back on our heels or we're\nflat footed meaning we're not doing well\nI maybe hard things have happened\nfocusing on the prospect of what we can\ndo for others not just trying to avoid\nloss or further shame or or just\ndiminishment is going to be the best\nthing so what what are the data on this\nyeah so um well first just look at\ncorrelational studies in these Global\nsurveys of Happiness um in almost anyone\nyou can think of the best predictor of\nLife satisfaction and well-being is\ngoing to be the meaning of your life in\nparticular the feeling like you're\nconnected to others you've contributed\nto others\nthat your life mattered that your life\nthere was something of value in your\nlife to others or to the world right um\nand so the just anecdotally the advice I\nalways give to people like going through\ndepression or the risk of that is to\nfocus on what you can do for others or\nwhat you have done right um so that\nthat's just correlation now\nexperimentally what we did in some work\nthis was started with my first adviser\nat Stanford Bill Damon who studies\npurpose in life is we ask the question\nof when you're going through something\ntedious boring\nfrustrating what motivates you to keep\ngoing and we there are many possible\nanswers to that but we compared two\ndifferent ones one is the potential\nbenefit you get out of that striving so\nfor a student in school it's like the\nmoney you would get one day from working\nhard and doing well\nan alternative though is what you could\ndo with the knowledge that you gained by\ngoing through the hard learning how\ncould you contribute to others make a\ndifference Etc with the Knowledge and\nSkills we call that our purpose\ncondition a couple things make\nthat different from this the standard\nnarrative but but I think ultimately\nintuitive one is the standard narrative\nis if you try hard in school or at work\nor whatever it is in suffer now then one\nday there will be a kind of financial\ncompensation so you're you're suffering\nnow in a way that will bring material\nreward in the future that the brain's\nnot really designed to make that kind of\ncalculation right it's like well how\ncertain is the reward in the future how\nfar into the future and how bad is their\npunishment right now so there's all\nkinds of affective tradeoffs that are\nhard for anyone or especially hard for\n13 year olds right so what a lot of\nschool comes down to is an adult saying\nyou need to suffer through 40 minutes\nper day of factoring trinomials because\nI said so that and I said it's good for\nyour long-term future so that one day in\nyour 30s you can barely afford a\nmortgage right this is not a compelling\nargument for most of America's youth my\nopinion the purpose condition though is\nnot about the exchange value of a\ncredential some long time in the future\nit's more like right now you're getting\na hard and kind of admirable skill that\nnot everyone's going to get and you're\ngonna then be prepared when the moment\narises to do something of significance\nfor others now that also is uncertain\nand in the future but for things that\nare contributions you kind of get to\nfeel like a good person right now the\nanalogy I often use is if I'm going to\nlike make lunch for the homeless I don't\nhave to wait until they actually eat the\nfood to feel like a good person I feel\nlike a good person when I'm putting it\nin the bag you know or even when I'm\ndriving to the homeless shelter right\nand I think it our idea was you can move\nup the reward by making it a social\nreward right now rather than a material\nreward years into the future because\nthen the pursuit itself becomes the\nreward right right now my and actually\nthe more frustrating it is right now the\nmore I'm being a good person because it\nmeans it was a hard skill to acquire\nthat'll prepare me to make a difference\nlater and so we we framed super tedious\nmath this is with Angela Duckworth and\nSydney Dello and Dave penescu and others\nas Marlon Henderson\nas a chance to gain a skill that helps\nyou contribute\nversus a chance to learn how to get an A\nand make money in the future versus a\ncontrol and what we found was that the\ncontribute to others version led to\ndeeper learning greater persistence um\nhigher grades over\ntime and in one of our\nexperiments we gave them a choice of\neither doing super boring math or\ngoofing off on the internet and we were\nsecretly tracking what the websites they\nwere going to and we found that\nteenagers did um more very boring math\nand watched fewer videos and played less\nTetris when they were given this purpose\nmessage uh before the task it's in our\n2014 paper and what I I of always think\nabout that's the kind of paper I wanted\nto go to graduate school to work on but\nI I think about it\nbecause if you think about Dale Miller's\nNorm of\nself-interest nobody thinks to do the\npurpose argument they're like of course\nteenagers are shortsighted and think\nabout material rewards and all they want\nto do is either look cool or make money\nor whatever but no like in our studies\nif you appealed to the chance to make a\ncontribution right now then they did the\nbehaviors that adults want them to do\nthey didn't Goof Off online and instead\nchose boring math and and adults think\nthe only way you could ever get that is\nby imposing our will and and with this\nkind of\nauthoritarian um set of rules but if you\ninstead just appeal to the love of\nlearning for the sake of others then\nthey're willing to kind of go through\nthe suffering and and in the paper we\ncite Victor Frankl where you know the\nperson who knows the why for their\nexistence is able to Bear anyhow mhm and\nI I think about that that a lot that we\nunderestimate how willing young people\nare really anyone is to Bear through\nthings that are hard and difficult if\nthey have a strong\nwhy I think this is one of the most\nimportant Concepts frankly ever\ndiscussed on this podcast if I'm really\nhonest I think that um you know we've\nparsed dopamine circuits and we've\ntalked about motivation and reward we've\ntalked a little bit about growth mindset\nin a Solo episode but never before have\nI really understood the um the why\ncomponent the meaning component and and\nI love how it marries so much of what we\nhear in kind of like you know pop\nculture psychology with real data like\nwe're finally uh thanks to you being\nhere meaning we're finally um in the\nguts of it um because we hear this like\noh it feels so good to make a\ncontribution but you know people are\nalso self-interested people want money I\nthen then people say well past a certain\namount of money you don't get any\nhappier and I would argue that um uh\nit's true money can't buy happiness but\nit can definitely buffer stress yeah not\nall forms of stress and money itself can\nget people into more stress but um\nanyone that says you know past blank\nnumber of dollars there's no incremental\nincrease in happiness I I I just don't\nsee how that could be given inflation\nand you know that treats humans like\nlinear functions I think that's a\nsimplification right if higher purpose\nis best defin is making a meaningful\ncontribution to the world um to a\ncommunity to the or maybe at the scale\nof the world maybe at the scale of a\nfamily or or um or what have you a\nclassroom and the thing that you said\nbefore that seems so important is that\nthe moment that you attach uh your goal\nto something that's for others it makes\nthe effort involved its own form of\nreward yeah that to me is so important\nyeah so so important I kind of want to\nhighlight bold underline and you know\nput a big exclamation mark after it\nbecause that's so different than like oh\nyou know I want to be the top player on\nthe team yeah which means that every bit\nof effort you put in you're like\nthinking I'm going to I'm going to be\nthe best I'm going to be the best I'm\ngoing to be the best\nbut um and one perhaps can then feel\nthat progress when one is making it and\nfeel like they're ascending that that\nstaircase\nbut something additional must come about\nwhen\nwe're invoking this this feeling of\ncontribution um and I think this\nisessential to our Evolution as a\nspecies because we didn't develop an\nisolation yeah I mean we had to show our\nvalue to the group or else they would\nget rid of us right I mean that's what\nit meant to go from being a child to\nbeing an adult and\nthe think about what it just take\nbasketball or whatever right to if I'm\ntrying super super hard and it feels\nimpossible to me and I'm not getting\nbetter and it's purely for me then I I\nfeel like a failure it feels like my\ngoals are not being met and they never\nwill be met right the effort feels\nterrible because it means something\nreally bad about me right now imagine\nyou're putting in effort for others the\nharder it is the more awesome it is\nbecause it's more noble right you've\ndone something that's super impressive\nand sacrificed your own happiness for\nothers right the social status of trying\nhard and failing for yourself is net\nnegative because it's about shame\nhumiliation I'm not good enough the\nstatus of trying hard and failing and\nkeeping going for others is like super\nnet positive right and I I think that's\nwhat people fail to appreciate is\nespecially someone young or even just\nearly in a career right starting out if\nyou can reframe difficulty and failure\nas part of the process of doing\nsomething with high integrity for others\nlike it changes the meaning of effort\ntotally and once you have a different\nmeaning then it something that\npreviously felt bad can instead be\nmotivating whether it's the stress like\nin our stress enhancing work or the\nboredom you're undergoing it's doing\nsomething super tedious um or anything\nlike that I remember when I was a at\nStanford as a graduate student I worked\nin the lab of John kosnik who is you\nknow famously detail oriented when\nwhenever we want to go in really deep\ninto something and go beyond what any\nother scientist would do our joke name\nfor that is giving it the full kosnic\nbecause in he's in Communications\npolitical science and uh there was one\nproject I was supervising\nwhere this will sound ridiculous but it\nwas what is the best adjective to use in\na survey item so say you want to go like\nhow hungry are you not at all very\nextremely like what adjectives should\nyou pick to label those in a survey item\nand so the task was to find every time\nthat human beings have rated adjectives\non a zero to 100 scale in the history of\nScience and then average across all\nthose to choose optimally spaced\nadjectives like not at all a lot a\nlittle so we had a lab full of\nundergraduates at Stanford who are used\nto you know creating startups and\nrunning nonprofits and this is very\ntedious work for them so how do you get\nthem to Super pay attention to all the\ndetails and not get it wrong where we\nreally going to trust their work it it's\nnot by saying you know you're going to\nget into law school if you do this\nbecause it's not really true and they be\nlike there's a lot of other ways for me\nto get into law school that's that don't\ninvolve going to journals from the 19\n20s to rate adjectives right instead\nwhat I started doing was give them what\nI call the save the world speech which\nis like look we're g to write this paper\nand it's going to be the kind of paper\nthat no one would have done because it's\nso tedious but if it's trustworthy\nthousands of people would know how to\nhave more accurate measurement and\nthey're going to be so grateful for that\nbut not only that there will be Skeptics\nand the Skeptics are going to look in\nour supplement they're going to find\nmistakes\nand then they're going to email the\neditor and they're going to say why did\nyou let the sloppy work into the journal\nand that happens all the time I mean I\ndon't know much you follow what's\nhappening behavioral scientist uh\nbehavioral scientists these days but\nlike you know if you have an influential\nfinding that's the norm is people should\nscrutinize it they should kick the tires\nand they're going to find it and they're\ngoing to you know out you and they're\ndoing more of that now like with Pub\nPier yeah which I think is great Pub\nPier is awesome um Pub Pier folks is\nwhere um papers are evaluated online\npeople find um sometimes outright errors\num and sure there are those like\nsleuthing for for like yeah you find\nfraud for fraud but most of what's put\nthere is stuff like um you know\ndifferences in interpretation or or\nsomebody will suggest that you know the\nauthors could have done a better\nanalysis or that maybe their conclusions\nwere a little too far-reaching based on\na particular set of methods it's good\nfor science I mean there's a lot of uh\nbad intentioned sleo thing that is\ntrying to find circumstantial evidence\nto make someone look bad is that true\nbut yeah really yeah that's a shame\nbecause the the the whole purpose of it\nis to better the work not to uh I'm\nassuming the whole purpose of pup here\nis to to better the work and of course\num point out you know where there are\nreal errors in in the the historical\nliterature right um well I think that\nthe the yes there well there there's a\nnew way to become famous in science\nwhich is to like you know find errors\nwhich again is really valuable if you\nsuccessfully do it but there's enough\nroom for interpretation that someone can\num with circumstantial evidence only\nmake it look like something's really bad\nand then cause an alarm and it causes\nall kinds of problems uh however that\nfor for me at least in our lab that if\nyou always assume that someone will look\nat your work with the worst possible\nintentions and will ask for every file\nhow did it get from qual Trix into your\npaper just assume that all the time then\nthat means you need to pay as much\nattention to the file that was\ndownloaded and how it was processed in\nevery you know part of the pipeline has\nto be documented um you just have to do\nthat and so that working with crosx lab\nthat's that's the process that we adopt\nit and there's all kind people email\nthey like wait this show me this finding\nlike okay here's the link to the server\nhere's the syntax you can go find it etc\netc\nso good scientists should do that and so\nthe the possibility of scrutiny and\ncatching fraud should motivate everyone\nto treat it as though it's inevitability\nand therefore you know be careful in\nyour\nprocess convincing 19-year-old Stanford\nundergraduates that that is likely to\nhappen you know and that therefore you\nneed to pay super close attention to the\ndetails that's that was my task as a lab\nmanager and so there it was a mix of the\nfear of Shame and humiliation but also\nideally the contribution that our work\nwill make and we had the hardest working\nRas we ever had that summer and that's\nnot an empirical claim that's you know I\nsay that not I didn't randomize the\nundergrads to that but that experience\nkind of gave me the idea for the purpose\nstudies was you know assume people want\nto do good work but all else equal\nthey're G they might find an easier way\nto do it and then motivate with an\nappeal to how this work could make a\ndifference how other people could be\ninfluenced by it and also if you don't\ntake it seriously it'd be a really big\ndeal it' be really bad and I I think\nabout about that a lot because in we\ndon't often appeal to the contribution\nvalue of the work we appeal\nto this you know getting a good grade\nand impressing people and uh and that's\nless important for me than did I get a\nskill and did I do high quality high\nintegrity\nwork so what you're basically saying is\nthat if we attach our motivation to the\ngive to the the contribution that we're\ngoing to make it actually makes the\nprocess much easier or at least more\nrewarding along the way um as well as um\nby definition contributing uh more\npositively to society um it's causing me\nto reflect on what we normally um\nperceive as like high achieving\nindividuals um so often it seems like we\nhear the stories of like the Steve Jobs\nis and I I really enjoyed that book by\nWalter isacon and that story very you\nknow impressed by right uh his\ncontributions all complicated person as\nis often the case with people that make\nbig contributions it seems um or people\nin the political sphere or people in the\nacademic sphere or the sports sphere you\nknow most often we we think of them as\nstriving for themselves maybe for\nthemselves and their family and then\nthere are these people that really stand\nout as as these um uh shining examples\nof like Martin Luther King or you know\nand others where we just are kind of in\nawe of how um Mission driven they were\nfor for the greater good\num what sort of work um is being done to\nencourage that kind of mindset the\ncontribution mindset growth mindset\nthrough contribution mindset I just coin\nthat contribution mindset um that's more\nwords in there right exactly that's all\nit needs more mindsets um but the\ncontribution mindset because I think at\nleast in this country um we're we are\noften raised to rever people that make\nbig contributions but then we get really\nabsorbed into that person's story yeah\nright it's like the story of the person\nand what made them tick and then that\nthere's a lot of ego it you know and and\nthey or they have a kind of obsessive\nnature to them um and we we don't know\nwhat goes on in other people's minds you\nknow we're so I must say there's a\ncertain arrogance in our in all of our\nperceptions of others like that we know\nwhat they're why they're doing what\nthey're doing like half the time we\ndon't even know why we're doing what\nwe're doing yeah um but I think you get\nthe idea here what I'm imagining is a\nmore um benevolent world where people\nalso enjoy striving more and the\nstriving process itself while hard has\nmeaning and people are not egoist but\nwhere there's a bit more balance like\nare we getting a little bit like we you\nknow kind of um looking at this through\nrosecolor glasses or I think it's\npossible I like to think it's possible\nyeah I mean I think that that the the\nversion that in in which people are\npurely pro-social and self-transcendent\nand have no\nself-interest you know is not super\nrealistic and it's not actually what our\ndata are finding so what we find is is\nthat adding this pro-social contribution\nargument has a big effect but if you do\nit absent any plausible benefit the\nperson would get it tends to not be\nmotivating so it's the combination of\nlet's just take the school case I'm\ngoing to learn something gain a new\nskill I'm G to get a job that I enjoy\nand that gives me freedom and make a\ncontribution to others we found it was\nthe addition of the pro-social part to\nthe self-interested part now if if it\nwas do XYZ and you know make lots of\nmoney far in the future and then give\nthat money away that didn't work because\nthat's still the same logic of sacrifice\nnow for later Financial reward which\nthen has an exchange value of some\nambiguous you know amount in the future\nthat one didn't motivate kids or\nstudents to want don't tell the\nphilan universities depend heavily on\nphilanthropy especially nowadays uh um\nand we're grateful to them that they\nsupport so much good work so you're\nsaying that that they um it makes sense\nthat there needs to be some component of\nself-interest right like jobs loved\ndesign right um presumably uh folks like\nuh Elon and and others love the the\nmechanics of what they do building\nRockets building um electric cars and\nthings like that but then there this\npro-social thing the the idea that that\nthe world could be better and different\nwith these things in them uh yeah if you\ndid if you did the work right I mean a\ngood example is is my friend Danielle\nkic who ran empathy Lab at Google for a\nwhile and before that worked at at Apple\nand uh and other places you know you\ncould think that designing products at a\nlarge tech company is purely about is\nthat product going to sell a lot make a\nlot of money Etc and that's obviously\npart of the value for the shareholders\nand so on but um you know her philosophy\nwas always okay what is what's going to\nhappen with the user what does the user\nneed is there life going to be better\nwith this product and that often led to\ndesign choices that made the product\neven better and more profitable and I\nthink there are a lot of examples of\nthat where you know when when the team\nis trying to create something that is\nhigh quality but with integrity and\nethics that are going to benefit people\npeople are willing to put in extra hours\nthey're willing to solve a puzzle do\nbetter work um I think there are a lot\nof examples of that that's on the\nproduct design side I also want to talk\nabout the management side so one of the\npeople I followed from my book is a\nmanager at company she was at Microsoft\nnow she's at a place called service now\nand I just studied how she mentored\nyoung employees her name is Steph\nakamoto\nand um she has this great story about a\na really awesome\n25ish employee 25-year-old is employee\nshowed up and had come from teaching\nTeach for America and now is in HR at\nMicrosoft and Steph could immediately\ntell her name is salony uh she's going\nto be bored by her regular job she's\ngoing to be able to do more than what\nshe had to do but as a manager you can't\nsay as the first thing you need to do\ntwice your job for the same amount of\npay that's like not a good management\nphilosophy so instead it was a\nconversation all right what's a\ncontribution you want to make to the\ncompany where in making that above and\nbeyond you're going to learn a new skill\nthat's going to help you move up the\nladder right so that in your next\nperformance review you're going to look\nlike a superstar like a total over\nperformer and so the time they were\nrunning GL manager development and so um\nwhat they decided was don't just deliver\nthe programs well which Steph thought uh\nshe could do well but also create a\ndashboard to track everyone's progress\nso every new hire would they would know\nwhere they are in the management process\nand it was Global during the pandemic so\nkind of a complicated time anyway she\ndid her regular job really well and\ncreated this whole dashboard which\nbrought value to the company big\ncontribution but then when it came time\nfor performance evaluations she could\nsay like you're already performing at a\nlevel two levels up that gave her\npromotional velocity she moved up she\nleft the company for a while now is the\nchief of staff HR at Microsoft right\nkind of in in in line to to lead\nMicrosoft and then what about Steph well\nSteph's team overperformed so which was\nincentivized but then she gets to go\nhome saying like I use my time as a\nmanager to change someone's life and\nthat brings her so much joy and she and\nit's just so much fun you know as a\nteacher to have some of our time with\nyoung people lead them to on a on a path\nthey wouldn't have been on otherwise it\nis a total blast to Mentor someone and\nchange their lives so I think that's a\ngood example of it's an everyone's\nlong-term self-interest to contribute to\nboth the company and the people around\nyou but no one's being a martyr they're\nnot you know really like it's also\neveryone's compensated so you need to\nthink about of course is the company\ngonna pay you if you help others improve\nand there important questions that we\nask there but I just think that's a good\nexample where we have a false psychom if\nit's either good for me or I'm a martyr\nhelping others but like the best work is\nboth and then it feels awesome because\nyou both Chang people's lives and you\nare compensated for it and that's\ngreat um certainly has been my\nexperience that doing things that I love\nlike learning and organizing and\ndistributing information\num with the specific intention of people\nbenefiting from it um should they choose\nto use it uh or apply it or think about\nit is um The Best of Both Worlds yeah\ncertainly let's talk about this other\nphenotype um the people that um and and\nthey do serve a role in in the world um\nfolks that um who seem whose sole\npurpose seems to be to critique to\nidentify errors and um and I think in\nthe case of catching like real uh like\nfundamental flaws and stuff play play a\nkey role we we need those right yeah and\nit's kind of unfair we that that as a\nscientific field we force a small group\nof people to have to police everybody\nelse's work ideally they wouldn't have\nto do that job and so there's a lot of\nvalue in the people who have developed\nvery honest and high integrity tools to\nfind mistakes yeah I think some of the\nAI tools for finding um errors at least\nin PH you know in in data sets right\nlike the images in a neuroscience study\nwhere you can tell that the images have\nbeen all\nor plots like I remember a few years\nback the Reinhardt shown cases of the he\nwas like this wonderin who published I\nwas like crazy numbers like eight or 10\npapers in science and nature per year\nand then I think it was actually um\nsimilarities in the noise the random\nquot in quotes noise plots that\neventually led to the the like the\nunderstanding that like there was Data\nduplication or something anyway I I\ndon't remember how it went yeah it's\nimportant to correct the liter that way\nright but then there seems to be at\nleast online there and and on social\nmedia there seems to be a um kind of a\nshort-term incentive I have to imagine\nthere's some incentive for people just\nbeing really critical like I I was\nthinking about this the other day um\nwhat kind of mindset would one have to\njust randomly go put a nasty comment on\nsocial media like if you just think\nabout it not about an issue you're\nparticularly vexed by or somebody's\nstance on like that that makes sense\nright people get get aggravated and yeah\nthey but just think about the mindset\nthere like oh you got your life you have\ntime and you're going to go like say\nmean things right like like to me it's\njust inconceivable um to do that online\nlike to go and just post that stuff but\nbut clearly there's something there's\nsome incentive built built there and I\ndon't think this is a new thing I'm I'm\nguessing that before we had online\nculture within medieval societies and\nthere were these these elements exist\nwithin us um and that there must be\nsome reward they must feel some reward\num but it's not it's not generative it's\nnot Building Society when appropriately\nplaced I guess we're saying it provides\na uh corrective mechanism um but what do\nyou think that's about and is there any\nliterature on on this kind of thing yeah\nwell not the exact example of um being a\ntotal jerk on online I mean I I can't\nimagine doing that and cuz who has the\ntime I mean I had four kids coach\nbaseball I don't know how I'm going to\nlike police other people unless it's\nrelevant to my work and I think\nsomeone's like not having integrity and\nwhat they're doing I'm like you guys are\nbeing sloppy then I might say that but\num what I what I find compelling is a\nbeautiful new book by Mary Murphy called\ncultures of growth who was trained at\nStanford under Claude steel uh was also\ntrained by Carol DW just came out a week\nago and it's getting tons of great press\nand in her work what she finds is that\nfixed mindset can be a cultural variable\nlike a a more a leadership variable not\njust in the mind of the individual and\nwhen that's the culture then she finds\nuh people are more willing to try\nto uh make everyone else look like an\nidiot so that you don't get attacked\nthat's the summary finding and\num there's a kind of deflection strategy\nthat if I if I trash other people for\nbeing idiots then it'll make other\npeople think twice before they mess with\nme and so but it creates the very toxic\nculture that they're trying to escape\nwhich is the threat of their own you\nknow Intelligence being attacked so it's\ntotally counterproductive and she uses\nthe example of Microsoft and the Balmer\nera where you'd go into meetings and\nyou'd get yelled at if you made any\nmistake and you weren't allowed to talk\ntalk and they would like literally flip\nover a table and yell at you and people\nwould leave the room crying um and uh\nthis there's a lot of accounts of this\nis a very public information and um one\nof the things SAA nadela did when he\ncame in was to chain what he said uh he\nsaid we have a culture of know at alls\nand we need a culture of learn at alls\nand um has the virtue of ending in the\nsame words so it's it's uh piy but I\nkind of like that idea and so Mary\ndescribes how in this culture of um\ngenius she calls it you don't just get\nthe hypercriticism you then the the the\nconsequence of that is unethical\nBehavior where you hide mistakes or lie\nabout things because you're worried\nabout being outed as not a genius so the\nthe culture of fearing mistakes gives\nrise to the kind of unethical hiding\ntype of culture now the the lay person\ncould draw a line between that and like\nthe and Bing and other like failed\nproducts you know that's I'll leave that\nto organizational Scholars to decide if\nthat's the story but at least the\ncautionary tale is like Boeing is\nanother example where Calhoun when he\ncame in as a CEO changed the incentive\nscheme at Boeing to be something called\nstack ranking which is where you fire\nthe bottom 10% every six months or a\nyear who within your group so if your\nyour group might\nbe higher performing on average than\nsome other group but the bottom 10% of\nyour group are getting fired okay and\nthis is goes back to uh ge it's a jack\nWelsh policy anyway so that happened you\nknow two years ago and look what's\nhappened in the last two years now he's\nout right you have all these mistakes\nwhere people aren't going and finding\nthe problems now again I'm not boing I\ncan't you know as a sci as a scientist I\ncan't say that that is the cause but the\nargument in Mary's book is that when you\nhave organizations like that culture of\nGenius you hide mistakes and then you\nhave unethical\nbehavior in order to um conceal those\nand then you don't fix them but in what\nshe calls a culture of growth you're\nlike willing to examine mistakes because\nthey're not indicative of a sign that\nthat they're not indicative of your\noverall inability to do well they're\nlike part of the process of growing as a\ngroup super interesting um you said Mary\nMurphy cultures of growth yeah\ninteresting it seems everybody worked\nwith Carol dwick you uh Claude steel\nMary Murphy friendship group it's a an\namazing Group by that I mean I have no\nfriends except people I work\nwith you've uh clearly landed in a great\ngroup nonetheless um this is very\ninteresting um so people who are\nhypercritical or spending enormous\namount of time being critical just for\nbeing critical sake are are ma are\nmasking they're cloaking themselves um\nit's a form of Self Protection yeah um\nthat's that's her that's the claim and I\nthink there's some pretty good suggest\nevidence of that yeah' be interesting if\nif online like everyone had to put some\nof their CV in their Mast head you know\nit's like it's sort of like what have\nyou done as you're attacking because\nthat would differentiate the people like\nElizabeth Bick for instance who I think\nthat's her name who's a u considered one\nof the um best uh data\nevaluation um people right she runs an\nher Twitter account is they essentially\nshe shows errors in papers and and I\nthink the goal there is to offer people\nthe opportunity to not necessarily\nretract although in some kisses are\ntrack but to alter the papers right and\naddendums and things that um to say\nwhere you know so that that's like the\nthe the appropriate use of of critique\nright she's not doing it to to cloak\nanything else presumably yeah as opposed\nto people that just run around trying to\npoke holes in everything that they see\nit's cynicism really it's kind of a it's\nkind of an like online cynicism well I\nthink it's it's easier to be skeptical\nthan it is to like eventually believe in\nsomething after being convinced and so I\nthink there's a\nthere's a default toward well I don't\nbelieve that and we get that sometimes\nwith growth mindset they're like well\nwhat do you mean 50-minute intervention\nhas a well okay but all the things\nyou're complaining about are things that\nwe addressed in the study so at some\npoint you have to just say you believe\nin the process of science or you don't\nand I understand if there were initial\nstudies that didn't follow the process\nof science or left big holes to be\naddressed but at some point it's like\nwell we did what you asked for so I\ndon't know what to tell you sorry mhm\nyeah I know the growth mindset field has\ncome under a bit of of of a not attack\nbut um critique um I know this because\nin researching the solo episode and this\none you know it's one always has to be\ncareful about relying on Wikipedia too\nmuch because it's the use of editors\nLegacy editors and um I'll go on record\nsaying that there's a ton of bias in\neven within the Legacy editors I just by\nthe way I'm now I just got my page\nvandalized even more but I've sort of\ngiven up at this point because things\nare clued together out of context and so\nI like if I look at growth mindset on\nWikipedia there's a lot of supportive\nevidence and then you can get like two\nparagraphs of like of critique right and\nso for the uninformed they don't know\nhow to weigh that yeah right which is\nwhy we basically need a new system well\nthey kind of want to say on one hand on\nthe other hand you know but then um yeah\nand there's no there's no real waiting\nwe don't know the expertise of these\npeople where they're gleaning from blogs\nor whatnot and look I think it's a great\nconcept I think that it's just um I I to\nme at least um seems that there's an\noverwhelming amount of evidence that\ngrowth mindset and related mindsets that\ntalked about today have have immense\nvalue I think um it's also good to have\ncompeting opinions in in any field um\nbut I think it as as we're kind of\nparsing motivation um for people that\num really want to make a I don't know\nfeel their best do their best make a\ncontribution to the world it seems like\nthe default state that the the fast food\nthe junk food um the slur the slurpie\nthe Twizzlers and the and the Snickers\nbar there I just got myself in more\ntrouble by naming name brands the junk\nfood um is uh is\nin hiding by critiquing because I think\nmaybe there's the man in the arena thing\nyou know um that it's easy to be a\nspectator it's hard it's hard to try and\ndo something real yeah I think that\ngoing back to this question of like are\nyou willing to reveal your mistakes or\nnot the Mary writes a lot about great\nexemplars in her book Jennifer Duda\nwho's uh you know developed crisper\nfamously has a lab that's hypercritical\nin the lab but then the work stands you\nknow well in public um and it's someone\nwho could have every incentive to just\nturn out as many papers as possible and\nyou know for profit Etc but instead and\nI've actually interviewed one of the\npostdocs from that lab and it's just\nlike an amazing scientific Enterprise\nthat I I write about this astrophysics\nlab vanderbelt um with a guy named Kavon\nstassen who it's just a Legend um he so\nas you know a lot of people would be\nthrilled to have one nature paper in\ntheir lives like he had five last year\nright but uh what he does is uh Mentor\nthe probably the most diverse group of\nphysicists in in all of America and he\ndeveloped what are called Bridge\nprograms where students often graduate\nstudents of color or students who had\nlow GRE scores low socioeconomic status\nthey're pre- admitted to a master's\nprogram physics at a local HBCU Sally\nblack College University and then if\nthey do well then they're pre- admitted\nto the physics PhD program and it's a\nnow well-known idea but the basic\nconcept is in the old days you look at\njust your GRE scores and say are you\nsmart enough to be a physicist or not\nand what he argued was that the coin of\nthe realm for professional physics is\npublishing professional physics and if\nyou come into a lab and you can analyze\ndata and write a paper and publish it in\na journal then you're a physicist so he\nhas people come for two years regardless\nof your Gres but as long as you have\nkind of grit and resilience and a drive\nas you're saying and lets them work in\nlabs and it turns out about about 85% of\nstudents end up getting admitted to the\nPHD program and then they do well so the\nfirst ever black first author on a\nnature paper in physics is his student\nright so like a ridiculously high\nproportion of racial diversity at Nasa\nare graduates of his program his\nlaboratory right and is at Vanderbilt\nhis is at Vanderbilt it's it's called\nthe Fisk um uh vanderbelt Fisk um\ngraduate program bridge program at any\nrate for my book I interviewed him and I\nwas like well that's your admission so\nwhat happens there's still five years\nwhen people have to learn to be a\nphysicist and every day they have a\ndifferent thing they do so Monday is a\njournal Club Tuesday is a coffee but the\nthe lifeblood of the lab is Wednesdays\nlab meetings where you as a trainee put\nup your figures in your paper in over\nLeaf which is like a wizzywig editor for\nscientific papers and everyone critiques\nyour stats your tables your figures your\nnarrative and everyone's just looking at\nyour work and critiquing it and these\nare all top physicists in the lab and\nthat sounds terrifying and it kind of is\ninitially but then by the time they\npresent at the conference they've heard\neverything and they're doing that far\nbefore they're spending three months\ndoubting themselves unable to complete\nthe paper etc etc it's like you just\nhave to do that you have to face that\nfear so it's very demanding but it's\nsuper supportive and they don't pull\npunches in terms of the critique of the\ncontent it's it's but it's never in\nquestion whether the comments are coming\nfrom a place of believing your potential\nto be a great\nphysicist and what I like about that is\nthat you're not like it doesn't feel\ngood at that time to have be critiqued\npublicly but it feels necessary and you\nkind of know that you will measure up at\nthe end of that process and that it's\nformative I think that's fundamentally\nwhat a lot of people I think\nmisunderstand about what it takes to\nhelp someone become better they think\neither I have to be a monster to\ncritique you or I just have to pull my\npunches but like you can be like\nstassen's lab and be super demanding and\nsuper supportive and and then people\ngrow sounds like the the key thing is to\nmake sure that one is gleaning critique\nfrom\num the correct sources and this is one\nof the the major issues with kind of\njust um open online critique while\nattractive because of the lack of\nbarriers it it means that you have to be\na selective filter right I mean you can\nsee this in um online comments people\nsome people are very impacted by them\nand then other people say oh yeah well\nthat's some person in a basement or\nthat's a you know like who what have\nthey done and you know but some people\njust have a thinner skin than others and\num but when you're in a in a community\nwhere clearly everyone cares about the\nmission the outcome the physics Etc\num then you can put trust in the\ncritique uh by the way I find it really\ninteresting that um this lab at\nVanderbilt has focused mainly on\nmotivation and drive um as the key thing\nas opposed to some uh standardized score\nmetric or something uh or prior\nexperience when I was starting my lab as\na junior Professor back before being at\nStanford at UCSD UC San Diego senior\ncolleague of mine said when picking\nstudents um you have to really evaluate\nmany things right ethics how they do the\nwork etc but the the main thing uh was\nis just drive are they driven yeah and\num yeah that turned out to be the case\nyeah I think it's it's hard I mean it's\nit's such a case-by casee decision you\nknow like you don't pick that many\nstudents over your career so you don't\nget to really learn but I think I had a\ncollege when I started who was\nlike just told me they just sort by GRE\nright away like just by standardized\nsquore by standardized testore I was\nlike well I would never do that he's\nlike how about this how about you take\nall the low gr students and I take all\nthe high ones and see who students do\nbetter yeah I I feel like um\nstandardized tests in some cases are\nnecessary but not sufficient yeah that\nthere's this other thing this like\nnuance and um I mean coming up with\ngreat experimental ideas or there's just\nso many examples of people people that\njust weren't good at standardized tests\nthat just kicked ass in their in their\nvarious Fields but but there is a\ncorrelation there typically I mean I\nthink my issue it like in in a perfect\nworld standard test scores would be\ngreat for Equity because there would be\npeople who didn't get great information\nin high school about where to go to\ncollege or started out in the wrong\nmajor and eventually figured out don't\nhave great gpas or didn't go to a great\ncollege but they have tremendous ability\nand they deserve a shot and so I think\nthat that argument for grees is makes a\nton of sense the the problem is that you\ncan just pay to have someone teach you\nhow to take the GRE and your scores can\ngo up a huge percentage and so it the\nGES end up being a proxy either for the\ntraining you got now or it's appr proxy\nfor how good your 10th grade math\nteacher was because it's mostly testing\n10th grade geometry and so again that's\ngoing to be a function of what\nneighborhood you grew up in and how good\nyour high school teachers were so what I\ndon't love is like I I would love test\nscores if they were about meritocracy\nand and equality of opportunity but they\noften end up being just a proxy for kind\nof advantages you already had so um\nultimately though for Kavon\nthe uh setting aside the GRE in physics\nwas like a hypothesis ultimately the\nproof in the that needed to be in the\npudding was did the students admitt it\nunder an alternative means end up\nproducing great physics and in that case\nthe answer is absolutely yes and so for\nme it's like yes consider it or not for\nadmissions but what are you doing with\nthe students when they arrive how are\nyou mentoring and how are you training\nand how are you breaking the link\nbetween whatever advantages might have\nhad in the past and the work that they\ncan do in the future if they're if\nthey're\ndriven we've been talking a lot about\ndata and other people um I'd be remiss\nif I didn't ask you a little bit about\nyou um uh no pressure to to share\nanything you don't want to share but um\nof all the things you could study of all\nthe contributions you can make you\ndecide to focus on this notion of\nmindsets and\nand essentially um trying to figure out\nhow people can be their best for the for\nthe greatest good of the world this\nwould be the way I would describe it um\nis that just inherent in your in your\nwiring or was there something about your\nexperience coming up that makes you\nvalue that in particular or um did you\nhappen to just uh\nresonate with with uh Carol and folks um\nand feel like hey this would be a great\nplace to place my efforts yeah well\nthat's an impossible question to answer\nbecause there's no I have no\ncounterfactual so a real causal\ninference person wouldn't allow me what\nso one this is a this is a digression\nbut uh so my only real precocious skill\nis that I can do the splits which sounds\nlike a weird thing to do but I can it's\nmy party trick at at weddings you always\ncould uh or you do gymnastics as a kid I\ndid but not seriously not for very long\nand one time someone another academic he\nwas like you can do the splits that's\nsuper weird I'm like yes it is weird and\nuh and he was like how can you do that I\nwas like well as a kid I was in\ngymnastics and then I stretched all the\ntime and he was like that is the dumbest\ncausal story I've ever heard in my life\nthere's no way that that is the single\neven the most important cause right and\nI just thought I think about that as\nlike my whole life I've been I've been\nposed with this puzzle of why do I why\ncan I do this weird thing and I told\nmyself that and I don't think that's\neven remotely true I think this for\nwhatever reason it just kind of\ndeveloped so I can't fully answer your\nquestion about why I like got super\ninterested in in this work but I will\nsay that out of um College I I thought I\nwas going to be a lawyer and that's\nbecause my my college major was\nsomething called the program of liberal\nstudies which is a great books major\nwhere you read the great works of\nhistory and philosophy and stuff yeah\nand you read them in order\nand so and there's no lectures allowed\nyou and you can't even read the\nintroduction to the book so you just\nhave to like read Hume and pretend like\nyou can understand it and K and stuff\nlike that and you argue with other\n19-year-olds about what it might mean\nand uh I loved it it was great I still\ndon't know what Kant was talking about\nbut I'll figure that out at some point\nbut then with PS the joke is probably\nlaw school which is the answer to the\nquestion of what are you going to do\nwith this liberal arts major and so I\nthought that's what I'll do but at the\nlast second I just had a change of heart\nand so I went and taught in a really\nlow-income school in Tulsa Oklahoma and\nI ended up being the 6 through eight uh\nEnglish teacher the k through eight\nbasketball coach I coached um or k38 PE\ncoach and then I coached basketball and\nran the book club and I like ran the the\nCat 5 cables to fix the internet in the\nAttic you know and it was great I worked\nlike 100 hours a week I made $12,000 a\nyear was a lot of fun had a great time\nand at the end of it I thought now I'm\ngoing to go to law school and uh when I\nwas doing my\napplications um a friend of mine died of\ncancer it got saroma it was real quick\nit was like six\nmonths and we all went back uh to\ncollege and were there for a service and\nI remember being in the\nairport and I picked up Jeffrey Sachs\nend of poverty which a popular book at\nthe time and just thinking like here's a\nguy who like I don't know was doing\nsomething pretty mundane macroeconomics\nbut he was spending all his\ntime talking world leaders in other\ncountries out of you know crushing debt\nthat was causing poverty and it's like\ntaking whatever precocious skill he had\nand using it for others and I thought\nlaw is not my Jeff Sach skill but what I\nI do know how to do is motivate\nteenagers like that's how I spend all my\ntime and so I thought I just want to do\nI want to do this science of motivating\nyoung people like as much as possible so\nthen I went to Stanford I'd never taken\nstats before never taken psychology but\nI just like tried to become like a wild\nman learning as much as I could and\nthankfully in my third year Carol\nstarted working with me and like we kind\nof haven't looked back since what an\nawesome story so totally Mission driven\nand and post talk causal inference so\nwho knows if that's actually the story\nbut that those are those sequence of\nevents did occur though post causal\ninference I guess you can map on to that\nfamous uh Steve Jobs commencement speech\nat Stanford where he's basically saying\nyou can't connect the dots um going\nforward only backward so it all makes\nsense looking back exactly you know this\nled to that led to this led to that but\ngoing forward we're we're kind of\nstumbling in the dark a bit um well I\nmust say I I and everyone else's are so\ngrateful that you made that choice or\nthose choices um clearly the work you're\ndoing is is having a huge impact I I\ncovered a few of your papers on the solo\nepisode on growth mindset and you\nmentioned nature and um the the fact\nthat most people don't uh publish there\nat all let alone once or twice or\nseveral times in their career you've had\nan amazing run lately and um youve just\nhad this this incredible Arc of of\npapers in this in this area of which can\nbe distilled down to I think um forgive\nme if this doesn't capture it all but uh\nfiguring out um how people can be the\nbest version of themselves for their own\nlives and for the world right I mean\nthat's essentially what we're talking\nabout here and I love the way you\nincorporate the neuroscience and the and\nthe motivation literature and um and\nyou're so good at attribution as\nsomething that we we should all model\nourselves around um it's really an\nincredible literature and um I'm excited\nto read the book uh 10 to 25 genuinely\nexcited this notion of a mentor mindset\nand um how we can bring out the best in\nourselves and others it's a it's\nphenomenal that you're doing this work\num please keep going and um I'm speaking\non behalf of myself and everyone else I\nsay you know thanks for taking time out\nof your busy research schedule and\nteaching schedule to come here and um\nteach millions of people about what you\ndo and what they can do to be their best\nso thank you so much well thanks well\nwe're just getting started and uh it was\ngreat to be here I did I I'm I missed\nbaseball practice tonight so not for me\nbut for uh nine-year-olds um an
