    "transcript": "There any evidence that one's\nbodily position during sleep\nor the orientation of the\nfeet relative to the head,\nyou know, the angle\nelevated upward or downward,\nhas any impact on the pattern\nof different sleep stages\nor quality or any other aspects of sleep?\nThere is a reason for it.\nAnd we'll probably come\nonto this at some point\nwhen we speak about different\nmethods for sleep optimization\nor the new wave of fascinating\nsleep enhancement tools,\nhas to do with temperature, we think.\nThat for you to be able to\nfall asleep and stay asleep,\nyou have to drop your\nbrain and body temperature\nby just a little less than\nabout one degree Celsius,\nor probably two, two and\na half degrees Fahrenheit.\nAnd that's the reason by the way,\nthat you will always find\nit easier to fall asleep\nin a room that's too cold than too hot,\nbecause the room that's too\ncold is at least taking you in\nthe right temperature\ndirection for good sleep."
