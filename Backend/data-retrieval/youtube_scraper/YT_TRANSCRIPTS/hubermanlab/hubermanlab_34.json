    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the hubman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today marks the second episode\nin our sixth episode series all about\nsleep with our expert guest Dr Matthew\nWalker during today's episode we discuss\nthe dos and the do Nots of sleep\nfocusing for instance on how to use\nlight and absence of light as well as\ntemperature both of your sleep\nenvironment specifically the room you're\nin your body temperature and much more\nin order to regulate the timing and\nquality of your sleep and we discuss how\nthings like alcohol caffeine and\ncannabis impact sleep and the various\nstages of sleep and we discuss the\nvarious tools that exist now and that\nare rapidly becoming available to\nimprove your sleep this episode is\nessential for anyone trying to optimize\ntheir sleep and when I say optimize your\nsleep I mean trying to optimize the\nformula that was addressed in the first\nepisode of the series which is the qqr\nformula the quality quantity regularity\nand timing of your sleep four variables\nthat combine to determine whether or not\nyour sleep is optimized for you and\nthereby providing the most restoration\nand Improvement to your mental health\nphysical health and performance before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost of consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nHelix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that are customized to your\nunique sleep needs it's abundantly clear\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwhen we're getting enough quality sleep\neverything in life goes so much better\nand when we are not getting enough\nquality sleep everything in life is that\nmuch more challenging now one of the key\nthings to getting a great night sleep is\nto have the appropriate mattress\neveryone however has slightly different\nneeds in terms of what would be the\noptimal mattress for them Helix\nunderstands that people have unique\nsleep needs and they've designed a brief\ntwo-minute quiz that asks you questions\nlike do you sleep on your back your side\nor your stomach do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night or maybe you\ndon't know the answers to those\nquestions if you go to the Helix site\nand take that brief quiz they'll match\nyou to a mattress that's optimal for you\nfor me it turned out to be the dusk DS\nmattress it's not too hard not too soft\nand I sleep so much better on my Helix\nmattress than on any other type of\nmattress I've used before so if you're\ninterested in upgrading your mattress go\nto Helix sleep.com huberman take their\nbrief two-minute sleep quiz and they'll\nmatch you to a customized mattress for\nyou and you'll get up to $350 off any\nmattress order and two free pillows\nagain that's helixsleep.com\nhuberman to save up to $350 off and two\nfree pillows today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by whoop whoop is a\nfitness wearable device that tracks your\ndaily activity and sleep but also goes\nbeyond that by providing real-time\nfeedback on how to adjust your training\nand sleep schedule to perform better I\nI've been working with whoop on their\nscientific advisory Council to try and\nhelp Advance wop's mission of unlocking\nHuman Performance as a whoop user I've\nexperienced the health benefits of their\ntechnology firsthand for sleep tracking\nfor monitoring other features of my\nphysiology and for giving me a lot of\nfeedback about metrics within my brain\nand body that tell me how hard I should\ntrain or not train and basically point\nto the things that I'm doing correctly\nand incorrectly in my daily life that I\ncan adjust using protocols some of which\nare actually within the whoop app given\nthat many of us have goals such as\nimproving our sleep building better\nhabits or just focusing more on our\noverall health whoop is one of the tools\nthat can really help you get\npersonalized data recommendations and\ncoaching toward your overall health if\nyou're interested in trying whoop you\ncan go to join. whoop.com huberman today\nto get your first month free again\nthat's join. woop.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by waking up waking up is a\nmeditation app that has hundreds of\ndifferent meditations as well as scripts\nfor Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deep rest\nor nsdr protocols by now there's an\nabundance of data showing that even\nshort daily meditations can greatly\nimprove our mood reduce anxiety improve\nour ability to focus and can improve our\nmemory and while there are many\ndifferent forms of meditation most\npeople find it difficult to find and\nstick to a meditation practice in a way\nthat is most beneficial for them the\nwaking up app makes it extremely easy to\nlearn how to meditate and to carry out\nyour daily meditation practice in a way\nthat it's going to be most effective and\nefficient for you it includes a variety\nof different types of meditations of\ndifferent duration as well as things\nlike yoga NRA which place the brain and\nbody into a sort of pseudo sleep that\nallows you to emerge feeling incredibly\nmentally refreshed in fact the science\naround Yoga Nidra is really impressive\nshowing that after a Yoga Nidra session\nlevels of dopamine in certain areas of\nthe brain are enhanced by up to 60%\nwhich places the brain and body into a\nstate of enhanced Readiness for mental\nwork and for physical work another thing\nI really like about the waking up app is\nthat it provides a 30-day introduction\ncourse so for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to a\nmeditation practice that's fantastic or\nif you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator waking up\nhas more advanced meditations and yoga\nneeder sessions for you as well if you'd\nlike to try the waking up app you can go\nto waking up.com huberman and access a\nfree 30-day trial again that's waking\nup.com huberman and now for my\nconversation with Dr Matthew Walker\nProfessor Matt Walker welcome back we're\nall so happy to have you here and in\nepisode one you beautifully described\nthe biology of sleep why sleep is\nimportant what happens when we don't get\nenough sleep and you incentivized\ngetting adequate amounts of great sleep\nand you defined what great sleep is and\nyou provided some excellent practical\nprotocols and tools for getting great\nsleep\nhowever today you're going to tell us I\nbelieve about the protocols for really\noptimizing one's sleep both conventional\ntools and protocols and some let's say\nunconventional not heretical but\nunconventional tools for optimizing\none's sleep so let's start with the\nbasics what are the basics of what I\nthink I've heard you refer to previously\nas sleep hygiene yeah I think we many of\nus can resonate with the idea of dental\nhygiene but turns out there's something\ncalled Sleep hygiene and there are\nprobably I would say five edicts of\nsleep\nhygiene I offer them as as\ntools and not necessarily rules because\nI don't think people respond to rules\npeople respond to reasons and not rules\nso if it's okay I'll probably just\nunpack each one of them rather than just\nsort of bark them at you and hope people\nassume that it's the right uh answer\nI'll explain the answer so people\nunderstand why it's\nimportant so as I said there are\nprobably five things that you can start\ndoing tonight to try to improve your\nsleep the first we've spoken a little\nbit about in that first episode it's\npart of the four macros of good sleep\nfirst piece of advice\nregularity go to bed at the same time\nand wake up at the same time\nno matter whether it's the weekday or\nthe\nweekend regularity is king and the\nreason is because when you feed your\nbrain the signals of timed regularity\nfor your sleep it will anchor your sleep\nand improve the quantity and the quality\nof that sleep because part of that\nsignal of regularity going into your\nbrain in terms of that repeated Behavior\nnight after night sleep in other words\nhelps train that Central 24-hour Cadian\nclock that we also spoke about in the\nfirst episode so that's the first piece\nof advice try to keep it as regular as\nyou possibly\ncan the second piece of advice is\ndarkness in my view we are a dark\ndeprived Society in this modern era and\nwe need Darkness at night as well you've\nspoken about to release a hormone called\nmelatonin and melatonin will help time\nthe regular onset of your sleep so that\nsounds great but what boots on the\nground Matt what does that mean I would\nsuggest the following in the last hour\nbefore bed try to dim down 50% if not\nmore of your lights in your home and you\nwill be quite surprised at how sleepy\nand soric that will make you feel\nI will do this in a regimented way I\nhave uh little reminder that pops up and\ntells me now is the time to dim the\nlights based on your bedtime and I'll go\naround and I'll shut lights down in my\nbedroom I will actually have a small\nlight bulb and it is way down to\nprobably as little as maybe five luxs\nand look is just a a metric of the light\num it's way down there and it's also\nvery deep orange sort of red and we can\ncome on to why that's the case so that's\nthe first thing even before you're\nthinking about sleep start to decrease\nthe\nlight for example if you\nwere there at let's say for a standard\nsleep schedule at 1000 p.m. and normally\nyou are getting into bed at 10:30 p.m.\nbut you feel pretty wide awake if there\nwas an electrical blackout and you lost\nyour phone magnetic to phone goes down\nlights go down Total Blackout my\nsuspicion is that fairly soon you'd say\ngosh how you feel quite sleepy whereas\nif the lights were blazing you've got\nyour phone television's on lots of\nstimulation you're probably going to\nthink 10:30 no I could I could probably\npush through for at least another hour\nso try to dissipate that light and then\nif you need to wear an eye mask blackout\ncurtains always good as well but we need\nthat Darkness at night because when you\ngive the brain the signal of Darkness it\nreleases effectively a brake pedal that\nbrake pedal has normally been applied by\nway of light on the release of that\nspigot of meel melatonin and when you\ntake the brake pedal off it\nstarts starts pumping out into the\nbrain you can also then of course\nprobably reverse engineer this trick in\nthe morning and this is another\ncomponent of why you've been I think so\nsuch a wonderful advocate for light in\nthe morning it does many things but one\nof the things that it does is reapply\nthat break on melatonin and therefore\nyou lose the signal to your brain of\nDarkness that's what melatonin in some\nways is doing we often call it the\nhormone of Darkness or the vampire\nhormone not necessarily because it makes\nyou look longingly at people's necklines\nand want to to to bite it which is great\nif you're into that but it's really\nsimply about it's releasing melatonin\nwhich tells the brain my goodness it's\nnighttime but if you've got bright light\non you come from your office you're\ndriving home so you've got artificial\nlight during the day which is probably\nnot strong enough to stimulate you and\nbring you awake you come home and you've\ngot again bright light but it's still\nstrong enough now to prevent the release\nof melatonin you start to shift in your\ntiming and you may have problems with\nyour sleep so that's the second piece of\nadvice I would love to ask you about\nthat Morning Light two and the alertness\nbenefits I'm as a sleep researcher more\nfocused on the evening component of\nlight and decreasing it but you've done\na great job I don't know if there's\nanything yeah there are a couple of\nquick points that um are based on some\nwhat I consider really nice studies uh\nthere's beautiful work in human showing\nthat bright light exposure in the\nmorning especially from sunlight but um\nif one doesn't have access to sunlight\nfor whatever reason there are\ncommercially available so-called sad\nlamps Seasonal effective disorder lamps\nthey range anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000\nLux very bright W but um but certainly\nuh morning sunlight viewing and lamps of\nthe sort I just described have been\nshown to increase the amplitude of the\nmorning cortisol Spike by as much as\n50% 5 so people hear cortisol and they\nfreak out they think that's not good I\nwant cortisol low but you actually want\nyour cortisol highest in the morning and\nlower in the afternoon and evening um\nand there's a lot of reasons for that\nelevated mood focus and alertness in the\nmorning and throughout the day and uh\nease of getting to sleep at night lower\nanxiety lower depressive symptoms and so\non so that bright light also serves to\num control the amplitude of cortisol uh\nit in the direction you want in the\nearly part of the day the other thing\nthat's just more of a uh underlying\ndynamics of the Circadian visual system\nwhich is a system that I worked on for\nyears um these wonderful um cells in the\neyes that are not for image forming but\nrather for detecting sunlight and bright\nlight for sake of setting circadian\nrhythm is that the sensitivity of that\nsystem early in the day is actually\nquite low so you need a lot of bright\nlight early in the day to effectively\nwake up your system and shut down the\nsleepiness signals such as melatonin but\nlater in the day it's a rather\ndiabolical system it takes very little\nlight even from artificial sources to\ndisrupt your circadian rhythm and quash\nmelatonin as little as 15 seconds of\nbright light in the evening I think CH\nChuck Zer laboratory at Harvard Medical\nSchool showed can quash melatonin in the\nevening now I don't want people to freak\nout and think that if they go into a\nhotel bathroom which oftentimes those\nare very bright in the middle of the\nnight flip on the light that they're\ngoing to um completely uh screw up their\ncircadian rhythms but if I'm honest\nthey'd be much better off using um their\nphone as a flashlight to navigate people\nalways say well wait but the flashlight\non the phone is very bright but let's\njust get logical here a light shown into\nyour eyes if such as a a flashlight is\nvery different than looking at a\nflashlight Beam on the ground yeah Far\nand Away difference so the point is that\nif you don't get enough bright sunlight\nor light in your eyes early in the day\nand then you're indoors under artificial\nlighting you might think well this is\nreally bright lighting this is the kind\nof lighting that could disrupt my\ncircadian rhythm at night and therefore\nit's sufficient to wake up my system no\nearly in the day and throughout the day\nyou need a lot of bright light as much\nas safely possible to avoid Sunburn and\nthings of that sort which you don't want\nbut then as the evening comes around\nafter Sundown you need very little\nartificial light in order to disrupt\nyour circadian rhythm and then just very\nquickly light from candles fireplaces is\nokay this is kind of interesting it\nseems bright it's but the but the\nmeasurements uh indicate that that's not\ngoing to shift your circadian rhythm\nmuch candles are great but of course\ndon't burn your house down so the the\norange and red tones in the evening way\ndim down that's the way to go early in\nthe day bright bright bright light as\nbright as you safely can tolerate and\nwhat I like about firstly your mention\nof cortisol do you described how\ncortisol is rising in the morning and\nthat's a great thing and it is a good\nthing and in the evening it's starting\nto drop and if you look right around\nyour prototypical bedtime and we're\ngoing to speak later in this episode as\nto what your real natural bedtime is\nversus the one that you may be taking\nright now it's very interesting cortisol\nwill almost hit its lowest point\nsomething that we call its Nader it's\nthe lowest point in that trough of its\ndecline right around the time when you\nshould be sleeping however there's a\ngreat study that looked at people with\ninsomnia and in uh subsequent episodes\nwe'll we'll discuss this too but one of\nthe ways that we think about or\nconceptualize insomnia is in two\ndifferent flavors sleep onset insomnia I\ncan't fall asleep and sleep maintenance\ninsomnia I wake up I can't get back to\nsleep and what they looked at was\nessentially cortisol levels they had um\na catheter in the arm and they were\nsampling it from the bloodstream and\nthey were able to do that every 30\nminutes so it's a little bit like\ntime-lapse photography and you're\ngetting a data point every 30 minutes\nacross the 24 hour period looking at\ncortisol across now a full 24-hour\nperiod and sure enough when you look at\nhealthy controls who can sleep well and\ninsomnia patients they look almost\nidentical across the day but then when\nit comes to falling asleep right around\nthat bedtime period the healthy controls\nare going all the way down the insomnia\npatients go down and down and down and\nthen they have a rise back up right\naround that sleep onset period and then\nthey start to drop back down again just\nas the control group but then they also\noften will have a spike in the middle of\nthe night which then comes down and then\nboth of them are staying low throughout\nthe early morning period and then it\nstarts to rise back up so it's not as\nthough net net overall there is a higher\nlevel of cortisol in people with\ninsomnia it seems to be right at those\ntrigger zones that map very nicely to\nsleep onet problems sleep maintenance\nproblems very interesting as somebody\nwho wakes up in the middle of the night\nand sometimes has trouble getting back\nto sleep that that resonates I I have no\ntrouble falling asleep whatsoever yeah\nknock on wood superstitious about this\nat this point but I use tools like\nnon-sleep deep breast Yoga Nidra long\nexhale breathing but you know and I\nthink these wakeup uh episodes seem to\nhappen more when I'm processing a lot of\nstuff from my daily life that's right\nyou know it's um the unconscious brain\num\noften times it's working through things\nand and will wake us up yeah I often\nthink\nthat sleep maintenance insomnia that\nyou've just described is the Revenge of\ndaytime emotions\nunresolved that's a great way to put it\nyeah so that would be so we've spoken\nabout regularity we've spoken about\ndarkness and we've spoken about the\ninverse of that in the morning which is\nlight a little bit of cortisol so the\nthird out of the five is going to be\ntemperature and the advice here is keep\nit cool as we mentioned a little bit in\nthe first episode and we will go into\ngreat detail when we speak not just\nabout these conventional and\nunconventional tips but we're also going\nto go into the future of Science and\nwhere sleep science is taking us to in\nfact optimize and even enhance our sleep\nwe will speak a lot about temperature\nsuffice to say that you need to drop\nyour core body temperature and your\nbrain temperature by a little less than\n1° cus 2 to 3 Dees fhe to get to sleep\nand stay\nasleep the general Target that we have\nin sleep science if you look across the\nliterature is somewhere around about the\n67 Dee Fahrenheit or I'm trying to do\nthe calculation maybe 18.5 is degrees C\nnow I know that that sounds cold and\ncold it it is but you can also wear\nthick socks to bed you can have a hot\nwater bottle at the end of the bed\nthat's great too but the ambient must be\ncold the fourth piece of advice is Walk\nIt Out and here what I mean is do not\nstay in bed for long periods of time\nawake and I think we mentioned this\nperhaps in the first episode too when\nyou are awake in your bed for long\nstretches of time because your brain is\nan incredibly associative device it will\nquickly learn that that this thing\ncalled my bed is the place where I'm\nawake and not\nasleep and what you need to do is break\nthat Association if you've learned that\ntime and time again because you've\nstayed in bed and the rule of thumb and\nit's just a a rule of thumb about 20 25\nminutes if you can't fall back asleep or\nyou can't fall asleep it's okay just say\ntonight is not my night it's not a\nproblem it's tomorrow is not completely\nshot it's fine I'm just going to get up\nget out of bed if you can if you're\nlucky enough try to go to a different\nroom and in dim light read a book listen\nto a podcast whatever it is that relaxes\nyou just do that don't check email don't\neat because if you start eating that\nagain trains your brain to start waking\nup and feeding at that time and only\nreturn to bed when you are sleepy and\nthere is no time limit for that I don't\nwant you to come back after half an hour\nwhen you are still awake and not feeling\nsleepy enough why because you're going\nto get back into bed and be in the same\nproblem again and gradually if you do\nthis and it's hard to do\nit you will relearn the association that\nyou had I'm sure as a child which is\nthat your bed is this place of\nsleepiness because often people will be\nsaying I I feel so tired in the evening\nand then they get into bed and they say\nbut now I can't fall asleep at all and I\ndon't understand it in part it's because\nof that learned Association so that\nwould be the fourth tip the fifth tip um\nmakes me um even more unpopular as a\npersonality and character which is try\nto be mindful of your alcohol and\ncaffeine now in a subsequent episode\nwe'll go into great detail as to how\ncaffeine Works its mechanisms why it is\nsleep disruptive and why in fact I've\neven perhaps changed my mind\non caffeine and and its benefits but it\nalso does have significant detriment to\nyour sleep so the rule of thumb here\nwould be try to cut yourself off from\ncaffeine probably at least 10 or so\nhours before you expect to go to bed and\nyou can just calculate back calculate\nthat and try to limit it so the dose and\nthe timing make the poison cut yourself\noff after maybe two or three cups of\ncoffee coffee and then that timing\ncomponent count yourself back cut\nyourself off decaffeinated coffee not\ntoo bad if you find the right thing too\nif you need that\nfix alcohol is probably one of the most\nmisunderstood sleep aids in a quotes\nthat there is it is no sleep aid at all\nnow if I didn't understand what I know\nabout alcohol and and sleep I would\nthink that too which is look when I have\na night cap just before bed or two even\nthough I don't wear them um I I may\nactually just fall asleep very easily\nand feels like I stay asleep very\nsoundly across the night so it's a great\nsleep aid and it really helps me there\nare at least I would say three issues\nwith alcohol the first is that alcohol\nis in a class of drugs that we call the\nsedatives and sedation is not sleep\nbut when you take on board alcohol in\nthe evening you mistake the former for\nthe latter and you think it helps you\nfall asleep the second thing is that\nbecause it's\nsedation or actually it's probably\nrelated to sedation if I were to show\nyou the electrical signature of your\ndeep sleep when you're just sleeping\nnaturally versus when you have alcohol\nin your system it's not really the same\nit's not a naturalistic form of deep s\nit mimics it it looks not too dissimilar\nbut if I really do my analyses and I\nalmost like that Pink Floyd album where\nI take the white light of electrical\nbrain activity coming from your head as\nyou're sleeping and split it apart into\nall of the different components there\nare some components that are no longer\npresent or some that are abnormally\npresent the second issue with alcohol is\nthat it fragments your sleep so it will\nlitter your sleep with all these\npunctuated Awakenings throughout the\nnight the danger that is that many of\nthose Awakenings with alcohol you don't\nremember because they're too\nbrief but then you wake up the next day\nand you think well I didn't have a\nproblem falling asleep I didn't have a\nproblem staying asleep but I just I feel\nrough I just don't feel restored by my\nsleep and you don't add two and two\ntogether the final concern with alcohol\nis that it's quite a potent Blocker of\nyour rapid eye movement sleep or REM\nsleep and in subsequent episodes we'll\ngo into great detail as to the\nincredible learning and memory\ncreativity benefits that come by way of\nREM sleep also it's essential for our\nemotional regulation and recalibrating\nour\nmoods so for all of those reasons I\nwould say two things first if you are\nstruggling with sleep not feeling\nrestored by your sleep keep in mind your\nalcohol intake and also just in general\nbe mindful of that if you are thinking\nabout your sleep and want to preserve it\nso much of what you just said resonates\nuh I confess that in my lifetime I've\nhad periods of um pretty spectacular\nsleep I characterize myself as somebody\nthat could fall asleep anywhere anytime\nbut I've also experienced the extreme\nchallenges of sleep and um and that\nrelates to different things life\ncircumstances Etc in fact recently I've\nhad some challenges with sleep despite\nusing the protocols that I and uh others\nsuggest I hadn't heard some of the\nthings that you're um referring to here\nand um middle of the night waking has\nbecome more of an issue I communicated\nthis to uh former girlfriend of mine who\num was uh I was in relationship with\nwhen I was a a junior Professor meaning\nbefore I got tenure and she said you\ndon't remember you had a Andrew but I do\nyou had a pattern back then of um after\nI would fall asleep you would continue\nworking on your laptop probably on\ngrants um and then I would fall asleep\nworking and then according to her I\nwould wake up in the middle of the night\nand work a little bit until I'd get\ntired again and then fall asleep and\nthen this would repeat so um really\nstamping down the uh the associative\nlearning element that you talked about\nbefore so that was probably the first\nperiod of time in my life in which I I\ncreated this um\nrather uh delerious Association of work\nin the middle of the night in bed right\num and then more recently I've had the\nthe uh experience of waking up probably\ndue to these like daytime things that I\nI'm waking up in the middle of the night\nthinking about and now because of our\ndiscussion during the course of of\nrecording this series I get out of bed\nafter even 1015 minutes um so that I can\nstart to eliminate that Association and\nanother piece is that I've always felt\nthat when I get out of bed in the middle\nof the night because I can't sleep and I\ngo to the sofa I often can sleep very\nwell reason being proving right it's a\ncontrol experiment proving that the\nlocation of sleep is uh the and the\nassociation of wakefulness at sleep in\nbed as opposed to on the sofa is is a\nclear component and this is in an\nenvironment that's of equal temperature\nI it's not a perfect experiment right um\nit's anakata as we say but I I think\nthat the associative piece is oh so\nstrong um for many people and so this is\nsomething to to really take seriously I\nlove that notion of and people will\noften say I just get up I go to the\ncouch or the sofa and that's where I'll\nwake up in the morning also they'll say\nwhen I travel and I go to a hotel room I\njust can sleep fine now for some people\nit's the inverse but for those people\nit's the contextual difference meaning\nthe change of the environment is so\nunfamiliar that it has not been bound to\nAssociation of wakefulness it's related\nto sleep or at least the opportunity to\nsleep sometimes even I've heard from\nsome people and there's no studies or\ndata on this even turning yourself\naround now this is hard if you have a\npartner in bed but you just switch top\nto bottom of the bed and you take your\npillow and you pull the duvet all the\nway down and you put the pillow at the\nopposite end where your feet used to be\nand you get into bed and even just\nlooking around and sort of having a\ndifference that alone is so subtle but\nit can make a real difference so again\njust keep these things in mind I know it\nsounds strange or this whole sort of get\nup get out of bed break the\nassociate and we'll come on to something\nwell actually I'll come on to it now\nbecause I think it's one of the\nunconventional tips and you mentioned it\na lot of people say to me that all\nsounds great I the science makes sense I\njust don't it's dark it's kind of cold I\nreally don't want to get out of bed so\ngive me some\nAlternatives I think the the single best\npiece of unconventional sleep advice I\ncan give you is do anything that gets\nyour mind off\nitself the principal reason that if you\nlook at insomnia as a physiological\ncondition or current working model\nmechanistically of how insomnia um plays\nout is that you are in this state of\nalmost low-level anxiety and you are\nsomewhat stressed and when you go to\nsleep or you try to go to sleep or you\nwake back up and you try to get back to\nsleep you just have this Rolodex of\nanxiety in the modern world we are\nconstantly on reception and very rarely\ndo we do\nreflection and unfortunately for many of\nus and I've been guilty of this the only\ntime we do reflection is when our head\nis placed on the pillow and we turn the\nlight out and that is the last time you\nwant to be doing reflection that's the\nworst moment and at that point I think\neveryone can empathize with the idea of\nyou turn the light out you're under\nstress your mind goes to those few\nthings in the darkness of night thoughts\nbecome almost 10 times worse than they\ndo in the brigh of\nday and at that moment you start to\nruminate when you ruminate you begin to\ncatastrophize and when you catastrophize\nyou're dead in the water for the next\ntwo hours so what do you do the problem\nis as I said your mind is on itself and\nit's going through these repeated Loops\nanything you can do for example you can\ndo some kind of a meditation and I when\nI was researching data for my book some\nyears ago I did look into meditation and\nI wasn't a meditator I was a hard-nosed\nscientist and didn't really kind of\nembrace with that notion or even that um\nthat group of people but time and again\nI read paper after paper and the data\nwas very strong and it was coming from\nresearch groups that I respected very\nmuch indeed so I thought well okay I\nshould probably give this a try and that\nwas 6 years ago and since then I now\nmeditate for 10 minutes every single\nnight before bed I do a guided\nmeditation because I'm not particularly\nskilled so I use an app that moves me\nthrough that but you can do whatever you\nhow whatever meditation you like that's\none example the second example is you\ncan do breathing methods because again\nyou're focused on your breath and what\nare you not focused on your\nthoughts and so anything that will allow\nyou to\num\nexplore some other Focus maybe it's a\nbody scan where you start at the top of\nyour head or you start at your feet and\nyou work your way up and you just say\nyou know moving through now my neck what\nSensations am I feeling now into my\nshoulders moving down into my chest now\nI can feel the ends of my fingers am I\nsensing\nanything and when you start doing that\nor any of these types of things the next\nthing that you remember is your alarm\ngoing off in the morning because you got\nyour mind off itself so I would say that\nthat's probably one of the\nunconventional tips but let me come back\nto the conventional anything else I've\nprobably missed out or being unclear\nabout the um actually I should probably\nsay one thing in terms of these not\nthey're not tips I don't like the word I\nknow you don't either or hacks or um\nthese are protocols and they're\nwell-informed scientific protocols in\nall of this discussion today\nyou can get all of these things in place\nand still have problems with\nsleep the reason is because you may be\nsuffering from a Sleep Disorder so the\nanalogy would be let's say that I'm your\nathletic coach and you're a sports\nSuperstar I can perfect everything I can\nperfect your your diet your supplements\nwe can perfect your Technique we can\nperfect but if you've got a broken ankle\nnone of those things are going to alter\nyour performance right now you've got to\nget to a doctor and get that scen to and\nthen we can come back to fine-tuning\nyour performance it's the same with\nsleep if you've got a sleep disorder\nsuch as snoring sleep apnea or insomnia\nwe need to get you to a doctor first and\nthen only after that come back once\nyou're resolved then we can start to\noptimize that's the only other thing I\nprobably should mention yeah this is all\nvery useful discussion because I think\nthat um of course there will be those\nfolks out there that just like what are\nthey talking about I sleep so well at\nnight you know consider yourself blessed\nmany many people struggle with uh\nchallenges with sleep and I think it's\nfair to say that sooner or later most\neverybody experiences some challenges\nwith sleep for whatever reason you look\nat the statistics that's highly likely\nin your lifetime you are more than\nlikely to go through either a period of\nchallenging sleep or in fact about of\ninsomnia I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge our sponsor ag1 AG one\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens and is\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs by now\nI'm sure you've all heard me say that\nI've been taking ag1 since 2012 and\nindeed that is true now of course I do\nconsume regular Whole Foods every day I\nstrive to get those Foods mostly from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources however I do find it hard to get\nenough servings of fruits and vegetables\neach day so with ag1 I ensure that I get\nenough of the vitamins minerals\nprebiotics fiber and other things\ntypically found in fruits or vegetables\nand of course I still make sure to eat\nfruits and vegetables and in that way\nprovide a sort of insurance that I'm\ngetting enough of what I need in\naddition the adaptogens and other\nmicronutrients in ag1 really help buffer\nagainst stress and ensure that the cells\nand organs and tissues of my body are\ngetting the things they need people\noften ask me that if they were going to\ntake Just One supplement what that\nsupplement should be and I always answer\nag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go\nto drink a1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer you'll get five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman you talked about alcohol I'm\nnot a consumer of alcohol anymore um nor\nam I and it's not I it's not because I\nhave anything against it yeah many\npeople do enjoy it and um and know uh\nwe're not calling judgment on on them I\nmean certainly much of the world enjoys\nuh alcohol could we talk a little bit\nmore about um aside from demolishing\nREM sleep um you know do we know that\nalcohol causes these disruptions in\nsleep directly meaning by changing the\num pattern of release of\nneurotransmitters like Gaba things of\nthat sort or is this an indirect effect\nyou know is this like through the gut\nmicrobiome that then impacts sleep um\nand the reason I ask is maybe we could\nget to some more\nspecific uh dos and do not protocols so\nfor instance if somebody wants to have a\ncocktail how close to sleep can they get\nand uh not diminish their rapid ey\nmovement sleep too much you know because\npeople are still going to want to drink\num and with that said if people do have\na couple of drinks and then they they go\nto sleep is there is there anything they\ncan do prior to sleep to uh try and\nrescue um their some of their quality\nsleep great question so in terms of the\nmechanism it seems actually not to be\nthe alcohol but some of the metabolic\nbyproducts of alcohol we think that\nperhaps the main culprit may be some of\nthe aldah highs that are the metabolic\num separate consequences of alcohol\nmetabolism you make a good point though\nin terms of the the the dose response\ntiming curve\nhow late or how early do I have to cut\nmyself off from alcohol people have done\nthose studies and they have found that\neven an afternoon single glass of wine\nif you measure sleep in the way that we\nmeasure it at my center with High\nFidelity you can see compromises and\nimpairments I wish I could tell you\notherwise I would say that based on that\ndata the principal protocol advice I\nwould have for you is go to the pub in\nthe morning that way by the time you're\nabout to sleep the alcohol is out your\nsystem and you could no no I would never\nas a as a public scientist I would never\nAdvocate necessarily for wanting I'm\njust kidding you but um that's that's\nsort of one of the unfortunate\nconsequences there does seem to be an\nimpact to say that there isn't is just\nme not being truthful about the data but\nagain if\nyou are think about the tradeoff here if\nyou're going out or you're having\nfriends over and you're going to make an\nincredible evening of memories and\nyou're going to open a favorite bottle\nof wine and have a couple of glasses of\nwine is your sleep going to be\ncompromised yes it is but maybe that's\nworth the tradeoff for that specific\nnight I would just not wish you to and\nyou've spoken a lot and so is our dear\nfriend Peter and\nothers there just doesn't seem to be any\nsafe amount of alcohol um but I would\nsay think about that trade-off simply\nhowever don't make it habit that you're\ndoing it you know multiple nights a week\nor more that would probably be the\nadvice\ngreat what about food and sleep um how\nclose to sleep um is it okay to have a\nmeal if you want to optimize your sleep\num I I like to eat my final meal\nsomewhere around\n6:30 p.m. but and I go to sleep\nsomewhere around 8:30 900 p.m. in an\nIdeal World sometimes I go to sleep a\nbit later uh sometimes I eat a little\nbit later it's just you know there's\nsome variability with these but um put\ndifferently what is the relationship\nbetween food intake and Sleep Quality in\nterms of timing of food intake and then\nperhaps we can talk a little bit about\num food\nmacronutrients it's very interesting\nthere was somewhat of a Dogma out there\nthat we have to stop eating you know\nthree or 4 hours before bed for optimal\nsleep if you look at the data the data\nis quite a spread no pun intended there\nis there are some people for whom that\nworks very well and if they eat even two\nhours before bed they just get disrupted\nin terms of their sleep some of that is\nabout people just feeling too full and\nnot feeling comfortable other aspects\nare that when you become recumbent when\nyou lie down you have a higher risk of\ngastric reflux coming back up and\ntherefore you get heartburn and that's\npretty miserable and people will\ndescribe that too by way of closer\nproximity of food intake relative to\nwhen you're falling asleep nevertheless\nif you look at the\ndata and I I did a recent very deep dive\non this personally myself about 12\nmonths ago it's not quite as Extreme as\nthe Dogma makes out if you eat 2 hours\nbefore bed on average it doesn't seem to\nnecessarily harm your sleep now that's\nvery different than saying what is best\nto improve or enhance your sleep but the\nway these studies were designed it was\nlooking at detriments they then went to\n90 minutes before sleep onset and even\nthere there didn't seem to be Market\nimpermanence 60 Minutes you started to\nsee maybe some signs but on average the\neffect size was somewhat weak but then\nwhen you get close to sort of 45 minutes\nor\nso then things did start to deteriorate\nI think it depends hugely on your\nchronotype and also just on your\nappetite Cadian Rhythm preferences too I\nam someone who I do not feel very hungry\nwhen I first wake up in the morning I\ndon't feel very hungry throughout most\nof the day and I will onboard most of my\ncalories\nprobably\nin the hours probably in about a 4H hour\nperiod maybe less even 3-hour period and\nthen I will cut myself off about 90\nminutes before sleep so I classically I\nwould have been considered as you know\nviolating this sleep dogma of of cutting\nyourself off at least three hours I\nthink it's very personal though just\nexperiment with it you will know the\nsituation um as for macros and specific\nfood\ncomponents the data is a little bit\nmixed certainly what we know is that if\nyou're eating a diet that is high in\nsugar and low in protein your sleep is\nworse why would that be the case well\none of the reasons that we think is that\nif you onboard sugar it can be somewhat\nmetabolically active and when it becomes\nmetabolically active it can increase\nyour body temperature your core body\ntemperature even just for very subtly\nbut that's enough to disrupt your sleep\nas we spoke about with\ntemperature but I think in terms\nof really the you know what would be the\nideal macron nutrient and even\nmicronutrient um dietry recommendation\nthat I would have for you I don't think\nwe have enough data yet above and beyond\nthat that statement um yeah yeah I I've\nexperienced um when I eat a very low\ncarbohydrate diet which I've\nexperimented with in the past maybe even\neven full ketogenic diet for for brief\nperiods of time although I'm an omnivore\nso I eat meat and eggs and I also eat\nstarches pastas rice Etc um but we know\nbased on beautiful work from for example\nChris Palmer from from Harvard Medical\nSchool uh who is a guest on this podcast\nI listen to that it was great podcast\nyeah Chris is is spectacular and and U\nhas advocated the exploration of\nketogenic diets for the treatment of\nvarious psychiatric conditions not all\nbut psychiatric conditions and and it\nseems and he agreed with me on this that\nwhen people go on very low starch very\nlow carbohydrate diets that sometimes\nthey can experience a bit of hypomania\nsome people can and challenge this with\nsleep and um sometimes there are\npsychiatric reasons why um people stay\non those diets anyway and then they have\nto do other things to encourage their\nsleep by their pharmacology or\nsupplementation or some combination but\nI I can say anecdotally for myself if I\nif I don't eat starches for a extended\namount of time a couple of days I find\nit very hard to get quality sleep as\nindicated by Sleep trackers um and uh\nand just uh sleep late latency to fall\nasleep is longer than it is ETC um so i'\nI've opted to eat most of my\ncarbohydrates Ates later in the evening\num which and violates you know every\nrule of you know eat your carbs early in\nthe day and and and I think there are\nsome data to support that eating\ncarbohydrates early in the day may\nactually um have certain benefits for\nweight maintenance or weight loss so I\nrealized that but those aren't my my\ngoals at the moment weight maintenance\nyes weight loss no so I think um I\ncertainly feel after eating a dinner\nthat has a bit more starch pasta rice\nthese things of that sort and a little\nbit lower protein as opposed to the\ninverse like eating a couple couple of\nriy steaks and a salad but no starch\nthat um my sleep is substantially better\num and I always uh attributed that to\nthe relationship between some of the\nstarches and the\ntryptophan serotonin pathway yeah there\nis some data on that with the\ncarbohydrate intake in the evening and\nof course that that tryptophan and that\ncarbohydrate intake um will contain the\nprecursor ingredients to something else\nthat we've spoken about which is\nmelatonin and so that may actually help\nhealthily boost that melatonin signal\nand there's a little bit of data on that\nto supported\nto we also did a study where we um we\nwere looking at night to night to night\nsleep and carbohydrate intake the next\nday and it did seem to support what\nyou're describing in terms of some of\nthe carbohydrate benefits we also found\na strange result that was almost the\nopposite prediction that we made\ncarbohydrate intake in the morning to\nequally help people wake up and we were\na little bit uncertain as to why but\nwe're going to go into more detail the\nreason that you mentioned\nthe the suggestion of not take on carbs\nin the evening is in part based on the\nevidence that your body's ability to\ndispose of sugar and obviously when\nyou're eating carbohydrate you can have\na higher um Spike of sugar now that in\npart depends on what you're eating with\nthat carbohydrate and also of course the\nnature of that carbohydrate whether it's\nsimple or whether it's complex whether\nit's simple sugars versus you know\ncomplex more um starchy uh carbohydrate\nbut the idea is that your body even if\nyou were to eat the same amount of\ncarbohydrate in the morning in the\nafternoon or in the evening same\ncarbohydrate dose and type but your\nbody's ability to dispose of that\nwithout having excessive spikes of\nglucose is worse in the evening better\nin the morning I.E if you're concerned\nabout your blood sugar um and your\nmetabolic Health maybe that's what you\nshould do I think that that data is\nunclear on the basis of if you are um\nglycemic normal meaning that you\ncurrently do not have signs of type two\ntwo diabetes or you're not pre-diabetic\nthen that may not necessarily be the\ncase and so I think that's why it could\nbe you know beneficial for you and I\nknow that you've um you think deeply\nabout that and and um I've even been\ntracking blood sugar as well I don't\nhave any signs of that but I'm just\nfascinated by some of that data and how\nit interacts with my sleep because I'm a\na sleep nerd so I think right now we\njust don't have plentiful data to\nrecommend a particular sleep quote\nunquote diet for improved optimization I\nwould say though that we can be a little\nbit more relaxed about the timing of our\nfood earlier you mentioned C caffeine\nand caffeine is a topic that we get into\ninto substantial depth in episode three\nbut there and now I uh I will emphasize\nthat caffeine is the most commonly used\ndrug worldwide I think the statistic\nsays that 90 plus perent of adults\nconsume caffeinated\nbeverages every day which is remarkable\nand a few years back I recall there was\nan article in The Economist that charted\nthe country's for which the caffeine\nconsumption was highest and way out on\nthe peak Peak peak of was almost uh\ntriple or quadruple what other what the\nsecond place country um consumed each\nday was can you guess the country that\nconsumes the most caffeine could be tea\ncoffee any form I'm going to suggest\nit's a Scandinavian country no but uh\nbut they're they're up they're up there\nit was Switzerland now I don't know if\nthat's still the case but apparently the\nthe reason I went I was thinking it was\nbecause I've seen the graph I was\nthinking it was Sweden but Scandinavian\nand if I have that wrong um certainly\nsomeone will put it in the the comments\non YouTube I recall the Swiss drink so\nmuch caffeine they have uh a lot to\nthink about so I love caffeine I drink\nblack coffee black espresso and Y Bronte\num I love Yerba Monte been drinking it\nsince I was a little one um because of\nthe argentines in my family um and I\ndrink it in the early part of the day\ntypically um a couple hours after waking\nor so I'll have my first um sip of\ncaffeine and then I try to stop drinking\ncaffeine somewhere around noon or 1 p.m.\noccasionally I'll have a shot or two of\na espresso in the early afternoon if\nthere's important work to be done and I\nneed to do that but I I've noticed that\neven that can alter my sleep in ways\nthat that I don't like but the afternoon\ncoffee for some reason tastes so much\nbetter than the morning coffee for me I\ndon't know what it is so it's coffee\nyear bate packed early into the day and\na lot of it for me yeah I have a high\ntolerance for it um but then I let it\ntaper is\nthat an optimal Contour of caffeine\nintake um would Zero caffeine be better\nif someone's just really committed to\nsleep and they don't like caffeine would\nzero be better than any and what about\nthat afternoon coffee or tea containing\ncaffeine I mean how disruptive is it for\nsleep so the profile that you describe\nwhich is high peak early on and first\nthing when you wake up and then tapering\noff nicely down into the sort of early\nafternoon ideal that sounds great to me\nas for that afternoon coffee it really\ndepends again on when you are expecting\nto go to sleep now for someone like you\nI would say I would love to look at\nabstaining from that or just switching\nit out to if you're using you know these\npods or however you're Brewing it let's\njust switch it out and do an experiment\nfor two weeks and we will look to see\nhow much is that afternoon coffee really\nimpacting your sleep and will track your\nsleep with some degree of High Fidelity\nwith a\nwearable and let's test that hypothesis\nbecause you go to sleep quite early you\nare an early bird maybe bordering on an\nextreme um early bird and we'll speak\nabout um or we have spoken about those\ndifferent flavors of\nchronotype I would prefer you not to be\nhaving that caffeine in the afternoon\nbased on how early you go to sleep and I\nmention that preference because of what\nyou described regarding your sleep\nmaintenance insomnia one of the issues\nwith caffeine is that not only can it\nmake it more difficult for you to fall\nasleep which you don't have in part\nbecause if you're waking up quite\nfrequently throughout the night and\nstruggling to get back to sleep you're\ngoing to be carrying a sleep debt into\nevery night and that debt continues to\ngrow and it's almost like compounding\ninterest on a loan so you will not have\na problem falling asleep in fact\nsometimes the speed with which people\nfall asleep and some of these uh sleep\ntrackers will almost penalize you for\nfalling asleep too quickly is because in\nsleep science and clinical sleep\nmedicine if your it should take you\nsomewhere you know healthy sleep onset\nyou know 5 to 15 20 minutes but if you\nput your head on the pillow and you turn\noff the light and within a minute or so\nyou're dead to the world and you're gone\nI'm exactly I'm worried that you're a\ncarrying a sleep dead now not\nnecessarily but I'm I would like to\nexplore it um with you and then I would\nsay even if you can fall asleep\nfine this factor of waking up in the\nmiddle of the night is also related to\ncaffeine why because caffeine not only\ncan make it harder to fall asleep not\nyour problem but it keeps you out of\nthat deep deep sleep and it puts you\ninto a more shallow state of nonrapid ey\nmovement sleep and when you are in this\nshallow State it's a easier for you to\nbe woken up but be and I think more of\nthe problem it's hard harder for you to\nfall back asleep because your brain\ndoesn't necessarily want to go back down\ninto that deep sleep and nor has it come\nup out of that deep sleep so you're not\nin that wonderful glorious thick\ntriy sort of sleepy State when you wake\nup you go to the restroom you come back\nand you just know this is going to be\ngreat I'm as as long as I can fumble my\nway back to my mattress I'm going to be\nasleep within another two minutes going\nback to it whereas for you you probably\nwake up and you feel pretty Wide Awake I\nwould like to see what happens when we\nnegate that afternoon coffee on the\nfrequency and the duration of those\nmiddle of the night Awakenings for you\nyeah I'm definitely making the effort to\navoid caffeine intake in the afternoon\nand I think um already starting to see\nsome of the positive benefits of doing\nthat great as evidenced by the days that\nI consume caffeine in the afternoon and\nexperience the the deficits it's a real\nthing and I I believe you've um about\nthe numbers uh on a different podcast\npreviously could talk a little bit about\nthe metabolism of caffeine and um and\nmaybe even some of the variations that\nexist between people in terms of the\nmetabolic U regulation of caffeine so\nhow long let's say uh drink a standard\ncup of coffee or a cuple of espresso and\nit has a gosh I don't know 150\nmilligrams of caffeine is that 200 could\n150 200 let's say 200 because certainly\nuh you know a barista these days is\ngoing to draw a a beverage over index\nyeah so let's say 200 milligrams and and\nsomebody consumes that after lunch at uh\n100 p.m. and their bedtime is let's\nlet's make them more conventional than I\nuh somewhere between 10: and 11: p.m.\nyeah okay so they're they're about 10 9\nto 10 hours out from their bedtime\nthey're having a nice strong quote\nunquote nice strong cup of coffee after\nlunch um what what does that look like\nin terms of their biochemistry and and\nimpact on sleep so caffeine has\nsomething that we call a halflife of\nabout 5 to 6 hours meaning that after 5\nto 6 hours about 50% of that caffeine is\nstill circulating in your bloodstream\nand thus your brain that means that\ncaffeine has a quarter life of somewhere\nbetween 10 to 12 hours now this is on\naverage and we'll come back to\nvariations but think of it this way if\nyou're taking a cup of coffee like you\ndescribed there at midday and then\nyou're going to bed at let's say 11: or\nmidnight that would be the equivalent\nbased on what I've just told you the\nquarter life of getting yourself into\nbed and just before you took yourself\ninto bed you Swig a quarter of a cup of\ncoffee and you H for a good night of\nsleep and the chances are that it it may\nnot happen now again that's a little bit\nsort of hyperbolic as a as a statement\nbut just try to conceptualize it in that\nway you would never think about taking\noff on you know a last quarter a cup of\ncoffee just before you put your eye mask\non no but I have some friends and um\nsomebody actually who works with the\npodcast team and we'll go out to dinner\nas a team when we're on the road and\nhe'll order like a big coffee right\nafter a 900 p.m. dinner and I was just\nlike can you sleep on like oh yeah no\nproblem and that no problem is in part\nthis I don't have an issue with falling\nasleep but if we were to based on the\ndata map there electrical brain activity\nyou would be able to see this reduction\nin the deep non-rm sleep and it can\nreduce it if you look at the data\nsomewhere between 15 to 20% now for me\nto reduce your deep sleep by 15 to 20% I\nwould probably have to age you by about\n20 to 22 years or you could just do it\nevery night with a late night coffee\nshould you should you wish so again I've\nand maybe we'll speak about this in in\nlater episodes I have changed my mind on\ncaffeine I think morning caffeine use or\ncoffee I should say being more specific\nis fine because I think there are health\nbenefits and we can go into in\nsubsequent episodes why coffee and the\ncoffee be in itself can provide those\nbenefits so I've become a little bit\nmore bullish on morning\ncaffeine but evening caffeine I just\nthink it's the data is just not\nsupportive even if you are and there are\nvariations and you were very um astute\nin your question some people I said on\naverage caffeine has a half life of\nabout 5 to six hours for some people\nit's quicker and for other people it's\nslower why is that it's based on a gene\nand we know the gene it's a gene that is\npart of a set of liver enzymes and the\ngene is called the\ncyp1 A2 Gene\nand there are variations in that Gene\nwhat we call polymorphisms and you can\ndo these genetic tests that you can buy\nthese kits and they all probably tell\nyou which you are are you sensitive or\nyou're not sensitive you probably\nalready know and so some people will not\nbe as sensitive and therefore they can\nhave a more compressed time frame of a\nhalflife because it's moving out of\ntheir system in a quicker manner so\nagain I'm not trying to be skir\nmongering I think you can have coffeee\nin the morning and you'll be just fine\nthat late night coffee I would I would\nlike to see you obviate that if you are\nsomeone who's doing it and the afternoon\ncoffee sounds like a you know maybe only\nevery once in a while and try and make\nit mostly decaf or decaf for that matter\nif it's really just for the taste yeah\nif it's just for the taste go decaf if\nit's not I understand that in some ways\nwhat I'm talking about is the ideal\nworld and drum roll it turns out that\nmost of us don't live in that we live in\nthis thing called the real world and so\nif you are facing a circumstance where\nif you're under pressure at work or if\nyou're high performing athlete and this\nis it this is the event this is you it's\nall in a think understand that you you\nare going to sacrifice some sleep at\nnight but maybe that sacrifice is well\nworth it so again I'm very open-minded\nI'm not trying to be um simply you know\ntoo rigid with this I want to take a\nbrief break and acknowledge our sponsor\ninsid tracker insid tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood

alcohol\nand its effects on sleep you've talked\nabout caffeine its effects on sleep and\nwe talked about food and its effects on\nsleep what about THC and\nCBD sometimes referred to more uh\ngenerally as cannabis and you know it's\ninteresting you know gosh when I was\ngrowing up um you\nknow cannabis was illegal um nowadays\nit's um either legal or tolerated or\ndecriminalized in many places not all\nbut I I would would say there's been a\num a a tide shift in terms of um\ncannabis meaning that many\npeople consume cannabis who are um\nconsuming it legally and consume it for\na lot of reasons that other people\nconsume alcohol in you know a sedative\neffect a slight hypnotic effect I mean\nyou know the actual definition of what\nthese drugs do it goes by certain terms\nin the psychiatric literature of course\nbut but in order to quote unquote mellow\nout to feel more relx to reduce their\nanxiety um it's it's far and away\ndifferent than when I was growing up\nwhere I me you would get into a lot of\ntrouble uh if you were caught um smoking\na joint or um taking a bong rip in the\nmiddle of the day but not and I realize\nmost people aren't doing that at work I\nguess it depends on where you work um\nbut it you know Edibles tinctures I mean\nthe the consumption of THC and CBD is is\nquite um quite robust in a lot of places\nso um with all the issues of legality\nand the fact that people who young\npeople um should not be consuming them\nme people 18 and younger not just for\nlegal reasons but the brain is still\ndeveloping um what is the story with THC\nCBD cannabis edibl smoked uh tinctures\non sleep\nspecifically it's very interesting if\nyou look firstly at the motivational\nreasons why people use\ncannabis based on\n[Music]\nthe published study somewhere in the top\ntwo\nreasons sleep to fall and stay asleep\nfall asleep and stay asleep obviously\nusually the principle first reason is\njust to get high and have the experience\nand the pleasure of being high if that's\nwhat sort of floats your um floats your\ntrain floats your train but certainly\nit's you know sleep um as and what we\ncall a hypnotic to put you asleep from\num the Greek derivative of the God for\nfor sleep that is high among the reasons\nthat people will\nuse we currently don't recommend it and\nhere is why certainly THC helps you fall\nasleep\nfaster very clear in the data the\nproblem is that first you start to\ndevelop a tolerance and to get that same\nsleep onset benefit you need to get use\nI should say a higher dose so you start\nto develop dependency and your dose\nregimen starts to\nincrease the second issue with THC is\nthat it's very good at blocking your\ndream sleep your REM sleep in fact many\npeople when they come and they tell me\nlook I was a heavy cannabis user even a\nlight cannabis user for some time and\nthen I stopped using and one of the\nstrangest things happened to me I just\nstarted to have the most wild Vivid\ncrazy dreams and I didn't know what was\ngoing on and it's a very simple\nexplanation as you've been using your\nbrain has been compromised in the amount\nof REM sleep it's been getting and\nyou've been building up chronically a\nREM sleep debt and your brain is smart\nin the sense that it does try to clock\nto some degree a counter of how much REM\nsleep you've lost and many people will\nsay yeah I don't really remember my\ndreams when I'm using but when they stop\nthe brain finally because it's been\ncleansed of the thing that's the\nroadblock to REM sleep not only did they\ngo back to having the normal amount of\nREM sleep that people would have they\nhave that plus they have what we call a\nREM sleep rebound which is even more and\nmore intense REM sleep which leads to\nmore intense dreaming so it's a very I\nsuspect there's a lot of people who've\nhad that experience listening if they\nhave been users and they've stopped so\nthat's the second reason we don't\nAdvocate it the third third reason is\nthat when you stop using you also go or\ngo through a very vicious insomnia\nwithdrawal syndrome often many people\nwill do now that depends on you know how\nmuch you've been using for how long\nyou've been\nusing if you look at the data and by the\nway part of the um clinical diagnostic\nthe psychiatric diagnostic um\ndescription of cannabis withdrawal is\ninsomnia that's how reliable this\ninsomnia problem is when you come off\ncannabis and if you look at the data the\none of the main reasons that people\nrelapse and start using cannabis again\neven though they don't want to is\nbecause they can't deal with the\ninsomnia that withdrawal has given them\nso you don't want to get into that\nvicious\ncycle should you wish again it's your\nchoice um so THC I think is not to be\nadvised right now CBD is interesting I\ndon't think there's enough data yet for\nus to have a very strong opinion but I\ncan at least offer mine the data so far\nis a little bit mixed in what we call\nthe effect size in other words how\nreliable and how powerful is the benefit\nof CBD on sleep but it does seem to have\nsome\nbenefit what's interesting is that it\ndoesn't seem to have the detriments that\nI just described for or\nTHC you've got to be looking at the data\na little bit careful with\nCBD it has what's called a u-shape\nfunction to it which is that if you're\ntaking too little and again I really I'm\nso mindful of not trying to be okay here\nare the numbers but if you look at them\nI would say you know kind of cross your\neyes squint your eyes maybe less than 25\nmigr you run into the danger of CBD\nbeing wake\npromoting rather than sleep promoting\nbut once you get past if you look is 50\nmilligrams and above then you start to\ngo in the opposite direction where it\nseems to be sleep\npromoting and I mention that just\nbecause at least here in the United\nStates and in many places in the\nworld that industry is not regulated so\nit may say 50 milligrams on the bottle\nyou don't really know now some of those\ncompanies will have what's called\nthirdparty Laboratory Testing where\nthey'll send it out and you can scan a\nqri code and you can look at an\nindependent laboratory that tested it\nand show you the p p uh purity of it so\nthat may be one way to\ngo so CBD I think has some favorable\nevidence right now if that's the case\nlet's just assume that you and I speak\nin another five years time and there's\nreally good data now for this what could\nbe the mechanisms I think there's at\nleast there's probably at least two\nmaybe three mechanisms the first is an\nindirect mechanism CBD has been\ndemonstrated very nicely in some\nfantastic studies to be an\nanotic which is a fancy term for saying\nit reduces down your anxiety and earlier\nyou and I discussed that anxiety and\nstress is one of the things that will\nkeep you awake so indirectly it removes\nthis kind of gate that is preventing you\nfrom moving down the Royal Road of sleep\nand it opens back up the gate because\nit's remove that gate mechanism which is\nhigh anxiety and by way of being an\nanxiolytic IT soften that anxiety and\nit's easier for you to fall asleep I\nthink that's probably the principal\nmechanistic bet I would have right now\nanother indirect\nmechanism if you look at some of the\nstudies in rats and we do um human work\nat my sleep center so we don't do animal\nstudies but if you look at the data in\nthe\nrats CBD can be\nhypothermic which means that it drops\nyour core body temperature and just as\nwe spoke about in earlier in this\nepisode you need to drop your body\ntemperature to get to sleep so I think\nthat's the second reason I think the\nthird reason is that it could have a\ndirect sleep promoting\nmechanism I think it's unclear right now\nexactly how it's interacting with the\nSleep Machinery of the brain we've got\nsome hypothesis the danger is again it's\njust not a well-regulated substance so I\nam actually just um full disclosure I'm\nworking with a company in the United\nKingdom uh in collaboration with um\nKing's College and The Institute of\nPsychiatry there to see if we can create\nan analog a clean analog of CBD but I\nthink the potential upside of it not\njust for sleep but for a number of\ndifferent psychiatric conditions like\nanxiety\num could be beneficial so I would say\nthat that's right now the the sort of\nthe skinny on THC and and CBD okay so\njust to make sure that I have the basic\nlist of sleep hygiene factors correct I\nhave regularity is King yep light and\ndark meaning that one should optimize or\nat least seek to optimize their exposure\nto light in the morning and throughout\nthe day and in the evening to make\nthings dim and dark yes temperature and\nthere you have a a little um it's not a\nmontra but what is it it's a warm up to\ncool down to fall asleep and then it's\nstay cool like Fonzi stay cool to stay\nasleep and then warm up to wake up yep\nand we will come on to that I think in a\nlittle while again then there's walk it\nout which is if I understand correctly\nif you're trying to fall asleep or fall\nback asleep and it's taking you longer\nthan about 20 25 minutes you should just\nget out of bed and go elsewhere in the\nhouse do something else maybe even lie\ndown on a different surface in the house\nto try and see if you can sleep there\nbut don't stay in bed don't create a\nparir Association of wakefulness and\nyour bed because that can lead to\nproblems in subsequent nights yeah and I\nwould only say that try to resist if you\ncan if you really want your bedroom to\nbe the place where you now become\nconsistently asleep try not to start\nsleeping in some other location\nconsistently because then all of a\nsudden you bond that with good sleep and\nyou unbuckle this notion that we're\ntrying to relearn which is know your\nbedroom is the place of sleep so it's\nfine to go elsewhere try to stay awake\nand force yourself to stay awake until\nyou are absolutely sleepy then go back\nto bed okay and then we discussed\nalcohol food caffeine and THC CBD AKA\ncannabis and with respect to alcohol\nit's clear that none is best if you're\ngoing to have\nsome uh you don't want to drink too\nearly in the day but you don't want to\ndrink too much or too close to bedtime\nbecause it can disrupt rapid eye\nmovement sleep food uh seems that\ncreating some sort of buffer between the\nuh your last bite of food and uh your to\nbedtime by anyway somewhere between you\nknow maybe 2 three hours but for some\npeople it'll be more like 90 minutes and\nof course that's going to depend on the\nsize of the meal Etc but eating a big\nmeal and then going straight to bed\nprobably not a good\nidea caffeine has this long halflife so\nif you're going to indulge which I\ndo do so early in the\nday beware the afternoon caffeine yeah\ndo the hubman tapa is what I'm going to\ncall it right now which is not\ninterpretive dense it's simply the\ncaffeine tape and then um THC CBD uh\ndoes nothing good for your sleep\narchitecture although some people have\nthe uh impression that it is good for\ntheir sleep because it makes it easier\nfor them to fall asleep but what they\nare unaware of is that it is disrupting\nthe quality and architecture of the\ndifferent stages of sleep in ways that\nare not serving people well that seems\nto be the case for THC and I think CBD\nyou\nknow has promise and research must try\nharder including my own and you um very\nuh kindly emphasize that you're not\ntelling people what to do they just\nshould know what they're doing so that\nthey can make uh changes uh if they so\nchoose that's right I would always say\nthat um I'm not trying to be a medical\ndoctor any advice that I give is simply\nscientifically descriptive advice it's\nnot medically prescriptive nor lifestyle\nprescriptive advice I'm smiling because\nwhat I always say is um I'm a scientist\nnot a physician so I don't prescribe\nanything but I profess lots of things so\nor as my good friend who's a musician\nTim Armstrong says I'm not a cop that's\nright so so do what you want um\nokay what a wonderful list to leap off\ninto the unconventional and more\nadvanced tools for Sleep enhancement so\num let's go there so I think many people\nmay have heard of some of the\nconventional but what about the\nunconventional I would probably offer\nfive or six the first one I would say is\nthat if you are struggling with sleep\nand you have had a bad night of sleep\nthe first first recommendation is do\nnothing and what I mean by that is if\nyou've had a bad night of sleep you're\nawake for 3 hours do not sleep in any\nlater into the morning do not go to bed\nany\nearlier do not increase your caffeine\nintake to try to offset it and do not\nnap during the day why am I telling you\nthose\nthings if you wake up later that\nfollowing morning\nyour adenosine clock that we spoking\nabout this building up of sleepiness\nthat happens when we wake up is going to\nstart later in the day so when it comes\ntime for you to fall asleep at what\nwould then be the next night at your\nnormal time you're not going to feel as\nsleepy why because you woke up that much\nlater and you're setting yourself up for\nfailure again equally don't go to bed\nany earlier if you have become a\ncustomed and your brain has and your\nCadian clock has become accustomed to\ngoing to bed at a certain time and\nhopefully you're doing it regularly then\ngetting into bed 2 or 3 hours early has\nthe danger it's not a certainty but a\ndanger of you then getting into bed and\nthinking well I'm I know I had a bad\nnight of sleep last night but I still\ncan't fall asleep straight away so now\nyou're spending another 90 minutes in\nbed at the beginning because you've gone\nto bed 90 minutes earlier thinking it's\na good idea to compensate don't do that\neither hold out even if you do feel\ntired my recommendation would be after\nthat bad night of sleep hold out for as\nlong as you can as close to your natural\nbedtime as possible then go to sleep and\nyou'll give yourself highest chance of\nsuccess don't over caffeinate that's the\nobvious one follow the beautiful hubman\ntaper and then obviously try not to\ncompensate with a nap why because that\nnap as happens when we sleep is going to\nremove some of that sleepiness that pene\nand once again you get into bed and\nyou're not as sleepy as you would\nnaturally be so you again go through a\nbad night cuz you're struggling to sleep\nor you wake up and you can't get back\nbecause you've got less weight of\nsleepiness on your shoulders due to the\nnap that happened earlier so I know it's\nhard but I would say when the alarm goes\noff after a bad night you just think I\ndo not want to get up it's been such a\nrough night I know it's a shortterm gain\nbut trust me it's a long-term loss\nbecause you're going to then just get\ninto this vicious cycle so that's the\nfirst unconventional tip the can I just\npause you for a second I I'm a little\nwide-eyed over here because\num I did not know any of that typically\nif I get a poor night sleep I'll do\nwhatever I can to recover that sleep um\ntake a nap I'll do you know I'll adjust\nmy to bedtime the next evening um so I\nhope everyone is paying uh careful\nattention to what Matt just said I mean\nthe that's a important list because I\nthink one of the very common things is\nfor people to just not get a great\nnight's sleep and I think most people\nthink okay I'll drink a little more\ncaffeine I will um go to bed a little\nearlier tonight you know maybe catch a\nnap in the afternoon this kind of thing\num and I would have thought that too and\nmaybe even suggested that and if you\nlisten to the first episode and where we\nyou know I list in a doomsday manner the\nthings that can happen by way of a short\nnight you you would think that that's\nwhat I would then recommend but it was\nimprinted On Me by um a wonderful sleep\nclinician U Michael pis um who sort of\ndescribed some of these features and\nexactly the reasons sort of underlying\nthem and I think I've just tried to bake\nthat out into a formula that makes sense\nagain it's not about the rule it's about\nexplaining it because when you explain\nit at first it sounds contradictory and\nparadoxical when you understand it it\nhopefully sounds logical and actionable\num so that would be the first suggestion\ncould I just sorry interrupt again my\naudience hates when I interrupt but I'm\ndoing it on their behalf because because\nbecause I I like to think that there's\num some value in some of at least what\nyou say in response um I saw a really uh\nterrific post from Dr Ronda Patrick um\nwho we both know and admire um for her\npublic education work public health\neducation work and she described a study\nwhereby if people are I think it was\nslightly sleep deprived Maybe by a few\nhours that some of the uh disruption to\nmorning blood glucose regulation that is\nknown to accompany partial sleep\ndeprivation and certainly complete sleep\ndeprivation but um in this case partial\nsleep deprivation could be offset by\nstill exercising in the morning that's\nright um which frankly I have to say if\nI haven't slept that well then you know\nnormally I'm like H maybe today's the\nday I don't exercise but now having\nheard that information I make it a point\nto still exercise um sometimes a with a\nlittle bit less intensity yeah um\nbecause I don't want to be completely\nexhausted in the afternoon um and and go\nto sleep at you know 4 p.m. or something\nreally disrupt my schedule but I thought\nthat was really interesting because it's\nit's a it's a sort of um partial\ninoculation of of the blood glucose\ndisruption caused by uh sleep\ndeprivation I I'm so glad you brought it\nup it's a fantastic study and I um Rond\nand I um I think even tried to discuss\nit some years ago on a show but I like\nit because it does offer some degree of\nactionable Hope and a\nstrategy blood sugar absolutely critical\nit is very sensitive to sleep when you\ndon't get enough it goes in bad\ndirections you used a very specific word\ncleverly so that word was\npartially at first you hear or read that\nstudy and Ronda was never suggesting\nthis too I'm not saying that you think\nwell if it offsets blood sugar and the\ncity was saying exercise can nullify a\nlack of\nsleep you conflate that single outcome\nbenefit with the idea that well but\nmaybe it doesn't actually re or does it\ncompensate for the deficits in immune\nfunction or\ncardiovascular disease concerns or my\nhormonal health or my learning in memory\nor my emotional and brain health maybe\nit does but maybe it doesn't so I think\nI would always just caution people to\nsaying when you hear a study like that\nit's very natural to think oh that must\nmean that it translates to everything\nelse in my body and everything else in\nmy brain it may but it also may not\nbe terrific so if you don't sleep that\nwell do your best to still get some\nexercise but just be mindful of the um\nthe fact that you know in the winter\nmonths especially that might if you go\ntoo hard in the gym or on a run you\nmight be a little bit immune compromised\njust be mindful of the fact that you're\nyou're a more vulnerable being when\nyou're sleep deprived and that but that\nexercise can help adjust things in the\nright direction and if it's early in the\nday um presumably that's not going to\ndisrupt your the proper bedtime and if\nit's later in the day I suppose as long\nas you don't need caffeine in order to\nuh to do that exercise and or um if\nyou're familiar with exercising later in\nthe day fine I you know I find if I\nexercise like I'm not one of these\npeople think can go for a run at you\nknow 7:00 at night and then just shower\nyou're a morning type because I'm a\nmorning type other people can okay we'll\nget into exercise a bit more in a later\nepisode um we'll be sure to do that but\nnonetheless I just rais that now um so\nwhat are some of the other\nunconventional protocols for sleep so I\nthink other suggestions I would have\nafter do nothing would be try to think\nabout limiting your time embed if you\nare struggling with sleep this is\nsomething that is used in the probably\nthe most well validated psychological\nintervention for insomnia and it's\ncalled cognitive behavioral therapy for\ninsomnia or cbti for short what happens\nis that you work with a clinician they\ninterview you they assess all of the\nreasons that you may not be sleeping and\nthen they create from their toolbox of\nmany different options a bespoke\ntailored sort of saval R soup\nprescription for you for your treatment\nif you look at the studies of that\ncollection of different tools in the\ncbti Box for intervention of insomnia\nand you ask of all of those which seems\nto carry the greatest impact on insomnia\nwhich has the greatest sort of\nGravitas it seems to be this thing that\nwe call bedtime rescheduling it used to\nbe known as sleep restriction therapy\nbut obviously if you come to to mean you\nsay look I'm not sleeping very well I've\ngot insomnia I say I understand and I've\ngot a treatment for you it's called\nSleep restriction therapy and you say no\nno no you didn't understand it I I'm not\ngetting enough\nsleep but it's not quite that here's how\nit works if you are spending so much\ntime in bed too much time in bed you are\nnot forcing your brain to be\nefficient and by way of constraining\nyour sleep window even to let's say five\nhours a night to begin with i Brute\nForce ruthless efficiency from your\nsleeping brain after several days so\nanother analogy would be let's say\nyou're trying to make a nice thin crust\nof of pizza base and you put the dough\non the table and you start rolling it\nout if you roll it too thin it starts to\nget gaps and holes in it why because\nyou've spread it out too far and you've\nstarted to create these absences\nthat's the same thing that happens and\nit's very natural as an insomnia patient\nyou would say I'm just not getting\nenough sleep so I'm going to start\nspending more time in bed it's the very\nworst idea another way would be to say\nlook I go to the gym and I you know\nspend about an hour and a half working\nout but if I were to videotape you a lot\nof people are doing the I think you've\nI've coed as your phrase but um the 11th\nrep where people you know do the 10 reps\nand then all of a sudden there's the\nselfie or there's the social media oh\nyeah the texting they finish the lastup\nput down and then straight away on the\nTT and if you look they're only working\nout for about let's say 45 minutes and\nthe other is wasted so what if the next\nday you came to the gym and I said look\nI'm sorry and there's some big bouncer\nguys at the door um you are only allowed\nto work out for 40 minutes and then\nwe're going to eject you and the first\nday you go back and you do the same\nthing and then you've only got through\n30% of your workout so you get booted\nthe next day you come back in you do a\nlittle bit more and you get booted again\nafter about five or six days you you've\nbuilt up such a strong desire and hunger\nto get your workout in you walk in you\nput your phone on silent you put it over\nin the corner and you just get to it and\nthat's the same thing that we're trying\nto do with sleep restriction therapy so\nyou have to be a little bit careful do\nit under supervision especially if\nyou're driving or you're operating heavy\nmachinery we just want to keep an eye\nit's not necessarily a big concern but\nwe would say Okay Andrew you're\ncurrently spending almost total about\nyou know 8ish or 7 and a half hours in\nbed tonight I'm going to restrict you\ndown to 5 hours a night and we're going\nto do this for the next week and the way\nthat we normally do it is I don't change\nyour wakeup time I change your to bed\ntime why it's easier to stay awake\nlonger than it is to wake up earlier so\nI put it on the front end to the\ncompromise and at first things don't\nchange but after maybe about four or\nfive days of going through this I build\nup enough of a shortterm debt in your\nsystem that your system all of a sudden\nthinks gosh I just cannot be as lazy\nanymore I can't do this thing of waking\nup in the middle of the night and\nspending an hour and a half awake I\ndon't have the choice anymore there's so\nmuch physiological buildup and pressure\nto do this and gradually what happens is\nthat you sleep longer you don't wake up\nas much and after maybe about 2 weeks of\ndoing this all of a sudden you go to bed\nat this later time so for you let's say\nyou normally go to bed at 8: I'm going\nto have you go to bed at maybe 10:30 11:\nbut we're still going to have you wake\nup at that sort of 4:30 a.m. Mark that\nyou would normally wake up and all of a\nsudden you go to bed at 10:30 11 you're\nout like a light and then again the next\nthing you remember is your alarm going\noff saying I'm sorry you've got to wake\nup and what happens by way of that reset\nis gradually we will then once you're\nstable we will start to back it off\nwe'll start to have you go to bed at 10:\nand if it stays stable then 9:45 then\n9:30 and tit trate you back to where you\nwere and if there's any sign that you're\nstarting to not sleep well we zip it\nback up again the goal here is in some\nways almost like hitting the reset\nbutton on your Wi-Fi router I'm trying\nto retrain your brain to better sleep\nbecause when you are not sleeping well\nyou've lost your confidence in your\nability to sleep and when I do this\ntechnique with you gradually your system\nand you cognitively relearn that you are\na good sleeper and you can trust in\nsleep and now your sleep does not\ncontrol you you control your sleep the\nhard part however is that it's not easy\nto go through and we have to be we have\nto usually ask two questions with\nindividuals firstly what is your\nmotivation for better sleep um we need\nto know that you really are motivated\nand then second you just stay with a hi\ntouch White Glove frequency checking in\non individuals and motivating them to\nkeep going because it's very easy to\nfall off the wagon so that's the the\nnext suggestion sleep restriction\ntherapy or bedtime rescheduling as we\nwould call it you said it's difficult\nfor people to go through you know it\ntakes a little bit of rigor a little bit\nof attention means in some cases getting\nless sleep than one would like but as\ncompared to something that you know\nsadly I've experienced a lot in my life\nof having challenges with sleep and\ntrying to get things back in order and\nlooking at the the bed and just going oh\nmy God Battle Ground you know Battle\nGround you know it's um I think it it\nmakes a lot of sense and I love the\nanalogy to the gym somehow if there's a\nrestriction into 1 hour in and out the\ndoor or maybe 70 minutes in and out the\ndoor CU you need to put your stuff in\nthe locker or something like that it\nalways at least for me gets done best\nwhen you just have those constraints I\nthink there's something about the human\nbrain that we don't do well in um un\nunrestrained systems that I I really\nthink guard rails are are fantastic I\nlove deadlines for instance yeah\ndiscipline is essentially the hard hard\ndeadlines like or as they say in\nAcademia because we you know write\ngrants all the time drop deadlines which\nwho up that ter but like if you don't\nmake it that's it it's like there isn't\na hey I'll send this in tomorrow 5:00\np.m. Pacific time that website\ncloses and you better Bo do you get\nthings done all of a sudden it's\nsurprising how much distraction you can\nyou know pull out the noise and focus on\nthe signal it's great signal to noise\nratio yeah and I I love the idea that\nyou that one can control their sleep as\nopposed to sleep controlling them I\nthink that that's um and and this notion\nof sleep\nconfidence um one's conf idence in their\nability to sleep these are important\nterms and they're more than just terms\nbecause I think that um a a field and\nand an area of Health practice and gosh\nwhat's more important than sleep it's\nthe foundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance period um really\nthrives on a common um common\nnomenclature and and I really appreciate\nthat you're you know peppering these\nepisodes with it with um new\nnomenclature um that captures a lot of\nthe essence of the protocols and the\nmechanisms so there that's my editorial\nplease please continue I would say that\nin terms of other things maybe just to\ngo through them um a little more quickly\nwe've spoken some about a wind down\nroutine most people underappreciate the\nimportance of a wi down routine we often\nthink that sleep is like a light bulb\nthat we dive into bed we switch off the\nlight bulb and sleep should appear just\nas quickly it's untrue sleep in terms of\na process is much more physiologically\nlike trying to land a plane it just\ntakes time to come down onto the\nterraferma of good sleep at night\nwhatever it is you enjoy as a relaxation\nmethod engage in it could be listening\nto a podcast could be reading a book\nmaybe it's a meditation it's light\nstretching maybe whatever it is that you\ndo just build it into your regiment you\nknow you would never you know be driving\ndown the road and then pull into your\ngarage\nat the same 40 mph speed you gradually\ndecelerate and you come to a\nstop it's the same thing with sleep so\nyou need to find some way to decelerate\nand we've spoken about methods already\nas to how to do\nthat the next tip is a little quirky and\nfunny do not count sheep there's a great\nstudy from my colleague Dr Alison Harvey\nat UC berley and she put this to the\ntest didn't make people fall asleep\nfaster it made them take longer to fall\nasleep however she did find an\nalternative if you are not into\nmeditation or podcasts or sleep stories\nor whatever it is that you you wish for\ntry taking yourself on a mental walk and\nit has to be a walk that you know very\nwell so let's say that you walk your dog\nevery day and you know there's a couple\nof walks that you take with your dog do\nit in hyperd detail So Close Your Eyes\nyou go to the front door you clip in the\ndog to the leash you walk out you go\ndown the steps out to the driveway then\nyou take a right but you always cross\nover and you look to the left and the\nright CU that's the place where traffic\nalways comes you cross over and now\nyou're walking up and there's that\nstrange sort of set of garbage that's\nbeen outside of that house for a long\ntime and you don't know why it hasn't\nbeen cleared and then you move that type\nof High Fidelity\ndetail allows you to do what we said\nearlier which is get your mind off\nitself and when you do that again\ntypically you fall asleep faster and\nthat's what she found it was a great\ngreat study I really enjoyed that I'm\ncurious as to why it works so well and\nI'm not challenging that it works I I\ncan imagine having just closed my eyes\nand kind of imagine what that would be\nlike it's very pleasant um there might\nbe here I'm just specul ating something\nabout engaging one's procedural memory\nbecause that's procedural memory you're\ntrying to remember how you do something\nas opposed to declarative memory which\nis about facts you know I remember this\nand this is going to happen tomorrow I\nwonder whether or not there's something\nabout using a procedural memory um as\nopposed to a declarative memory\nvisualization somebody should do that\nstudy they should and I think it's\ncertainly possible that when you're\nincorporating some aspect you know some\naspects of the scene and the information\nis more sort of veridical and maybe EP\nsort of episodic declarative memory but\nwhen you're taking yourself for a mental\nwalk what is the fundamental premise of\nthat it's a walk it's motion it's\nprocedural memory and so maybe it's\nsomething to do about with being more\nattentive to becoming embodied because\nwhen you're out walking and you're\nmoving it is a more embodied experience\nthan just sitting there at your desk\nwhich is your mostly your head and very\nlittle your body so I think it's an\nintriguing idea and um I think another\ntip that I now think of which also comes\nfrom the work of Dr Allison\nHarvey when individuals come up to me um\nafter sort of public events or they see\nme at the airport they'll say look every\nnight for some strange reason at 2:45\na.m. I wake up and it happens three or\nfour nights a week\nmy first question to them is how do you\nknow it's\n2:45 and they say well I look at the\nclock or I look at my\nphone best piece of advice next remove\nall clock faces from the bedroom no\nmatter how bad your sleep is going to be\nthat night knowing what time it is is\nonly going to make matters worse it is\nnot going to make matters any\nbetter and that can create\nan anxiety trigger that you think it's\n245 and then you're tossing and turning\nyou look back at the clock and now it's\n3:14 a.m. and you think I've got to be\nawake at 600 I've got that big meeting\nand now it's\n5:2 don't do that to yourself and I even\nthough I don't typically struggle with\nsleep I have no clock faces in my\nbedroom the phone that I use to help do\nthe guided meditation is an old phone\nand it has\nonly Wi-Fi connectivity and nothing else\non it and I will only hit play and then\nI will never turn it around um I will\nnot look at the clock face just doesn't\nhelp me another incentive for keeping\nthe phone out of the room um if if one\ncan I I understand there are reasons\nwhen um one would want the phone in the\nroom if you know it's potentially\nsignaling an emergency you know well I\nthink I think it's a very important\npoint and we've done some work in this\narea too what that phone does is create\na a low level of anxiety it's what we\ncall anticipatory\nanxiety one of the mechanisms separate\nfrom that well it's related to that if\nyou look at teen phone use one of the\nreasons that they don't sleep very well\nat night is that they're constantly\nchecking their phones because of fomo a\nfear of missing out what has gone on as\nI've been asleep and it's stunning the\ndata but for most adults the other\nreason I don't like advocating for phone\nuse when your alarm goes off in the\nmorning what is the first thing that you\ndo as you're in bed you swipe right or\nyou unlock your phone and you instantly\nstart checking social media emails text\nmessages and this tsunami of Stress and\nAnxiety just floods over you it hits you\nlike this wall of anxiet\nand I bring this up because it again\ntrains your brain for expectation of\nthat anticipatory anxiety has a\nconsequence on your sleep and everyone\nknows this let's say that you've booked\nan early morning flight and you've got\nto wake up at 5:00 a.m. when normally\nyou wake up at 7\na.m. two things will usually happen\nfirst you know that you're just not\ngoing to sleep as deeply that night\nbecause you're on edge and this is for\nan interview or it's for critical like\nthis is a non-negotiable trip that has\nto happen you've got to wake up the\nsecond thing is that when you\nare expecting that that wave of sort of\na need to wake up and maybe it's just\nI'm expecting the phone again you will\nwake up just a few minutes before your\nalarm it's stunning how many people will\nsay I had this big flight the next day\nand you almost know I'm going to wake up\n2 minutes before my alarm goes off why\nbecause your brain has stayed in this\nshallow state of anticipatory anxiety\nand you don't get as much deep sleep and\nwe've now demonstrated that we others\nwhen you have that low level anxiety the\ndepth of your deep sleep is not as deep\nyou don't get the good so again not to\nbe trying to dictate what people do just\nbe aware that when you do create that\nbehavior and that regiment it becomes\nalmost like a knee Jack sort of trained\nhabitual response terrific let's talk\nabout some of the advanced tools for\nSleep enhancement you know what sorts of\nmethods could one incorporate um you\nknow what are some of the data and um\nand is there any way that we can sort of\nlump these into uh sort of a some\nframework or categories because I know\nthere are a lot of different tools there\nare and I suppose this would be you know\nI know our friend pet has spoken about\nmedicine 3.0 I think this would probably\nbe sleep optimization 3.0 what is coming\ndown the pike what is in the research\nand I think you know could make it to\nMarket or has made it to Market but yet\nwe're still right on the cusp we've seen\nWei again in the Royal Wii have been\nable to augment human sleep in at least\nfour different ways there are methods\nfor electrical brain stimulation there\nare methods for acoustic stimulation of\nsleep so electrical stimulation of sleep\nacoustic stimulation of\nsleep thermal manipulation of sleep and\nthen finally kinesthetic manipulation of\nsleep meaning movement based\nstimulation and I maybe I can just of go\ninto each one of those the electrical\nstimulation is probably the most well\nrendered of all of those four\nin part because we started there and we\nand here it's not the Royal Wii we have\ndone a lot of work on on this and um I\ncan tell you a little bit about a\ncompany emerging from that but when\nyou're trying to manipulate the human\nbrain the principal currency in which\nthe brain communicates is electricity\nnow there are lots of things that help\nit do that such as chemicals but the\nprincipal language and um verbiage of\nthe brain is electricity so if you're\ngoing to manipulate the brain why don't\nyou speak in its currency of\nelectricity so we and others have\ndeveloped a method based on something\ncalled direct current brain\nstimulation and specifically something\ncalled transcranial direct current\nstimulation and I'll unpack that trans\nmeaning movement so if you've heard of\nTransport it's about moving things from\none port to another um transatlantic\nmoving you know across the Atlantic so\nhere the start of it is moving you're\nmoving something from one place to the\nnext trans cranial means through your\nskull so we're moving something through\nyour skull transcranial direct current\nis the type of voltage or the type of\nelectrical impulse that we're putting in\nit could be alternating current or it\ncould be direct current and early\nmethods and those we use have been\ndirect current so transcranial direct\ncurrent and then stimulation we're\ntrying to stimulate the brain\nspecifically the cortex\nand the way that we do this is that we\napply electrode pads to your head and we\ninsert a small amount of voltage into\nyour brain now it's so small that you\ntypically don't feel it but it has a\nmeasurable impact on that electrical\nbrain\nactivity so very early on scientists and\nwe weren't the first to do do this by\nany means there was a great paper now\nfamous paper in my field by um wonderful\nscientist yam born in Germany and they\ntook a group of subjects and they\napplied these electrod pads and\nspecifically to the front of the brain\nand I'll explain why we target the front\nof the brain with sleep electrical\nenhancement or the\nelectruepart slow powerful waves that\ndefine deep sleep and what they did in\none of those groups the other group was\nthe placebo group they still had the\nelectrodes applied they still went to\nsleep in the stimulation group they\nwaited until those individuals went into\ndeep sleep and I told you in the first\nepisode that those deep sleep brain\nwaves were going up and down very very\nslowly maybe just once or twice a second\nso they started to stimulate the brain\ninputting the stimulation pulses at a\nvery slow Rhythm trying to match the\nrhythm of the brain in fact they were\nless than one Hertz less than one cycle\nper second in terms of a pulse it's\nalmost as though we're trying to act\nlike a a choir to a flagging lead\nvocalist and as these brain waves are\ngoing up and down you're trying to sing\nin time with those deep sleep brain\nwaves and in doing so you're trying to\nboost and amplify the size of those deep\nsleep brain waves now to begin with they\njust waited until they went into deep\nsleep and they started to stimulate at\nthat frequency and I'll come back to why\nthat's important in a second but sure\nenough what they demonstrated they were\nable to boost the electrical quality of\nthat deep sleep by about\n60% and they were also able to almost\ndouble the amount of memory benefit that\nsleep provided wow which is very\nimpressive that is impressive now I\nshould note that there was more recently\na replication attempt of that paper and\nthey did very good job they really did\nit to the letter and they weren't able\nto replicate the effects as powerfully\nhowever subsequent Studies have now\ntaken a more nuanced approach and it's\nthe one that we've taken too and it's\ncalled closed loop\nstimulation Clos Loop here simply means\nthat I'm not going to just wait until\nyou go into deep sleep and then just\ntake a chance and start stimulating your\nbrain not knowing of the synchrony of my\npulses into your brain relative to the\nbrain waves that you're experiencing\nclosed loop does do that so what I'm\ndoing is I'm measuring the electrical\nbrain waves that occurring and because\nthey're nice and slow they're very\npredictable and I can program my\nalgorithm and my brain stimulation\nmachine to say I'm going to wait and\nwait and as soon as you are on this peak\nof your slow wave it turns out to be the\nnegative trough but I'll forgo that we\nthen try to strike at that point of\nmidnight when you're going through the\nbiggest sort of powerful sort of dip in\nthe the brain wave and we're trying to\nsort of enhance it and same with the\npeak so this is where we take a we get a\nstimulus from the brain your electrical\nbrain activity and then we create a\ntimed response so it's a stimulus\nresponse it's a call and response Loop\nand by way of doing that it's a much\nsmarter specific method than a more\ngeneralized I'm just going to stimulate\nand hope I catch those waves at the\nPeaks the reason is important because\ndifferent people have different speeds\nof their slow brain waves they're all\nslow but your speed of brain wave may be\na little bit different to mine and if\nI'm off with my stimulation by let's say\njust half a second or a quarter of a\nsecond time and time again I may be\nleaving some benefit on the table but\nclosed loop stimulation creates this\npersonalized electrical prescription of\nstimulation and when you do that you get\nvery reliable benefits you can boost\nthose deep slope brain waves you get the\nmemory benefits but also what we found\nis you not only boost those deep sleep\nbrain waves you boost another electrical\nsignature that I spoke about in the\nfirst episode called sleep spindles and\nit seems to be the combination of those\ntwo things by way of electrical\nstimulation that provides the benefits\nnow I should know I haven't mentioned\nthis before you can buy these devices on\nthe internet DIY style do not do that if\nyou go on to the internet too you can\nalso find some horror stories people\nhave misappropriated the voltage they've\ngot skin burs they've lost their\neyesight for several weeks do not do\nthis at home I promise you use you know\nwait until these products come out and\nthat's one of the reasons why we've\nscaled it into a company and we're we're\ntrying to do this we've got a long way\nto go yet huge number of trials that we\nhave to do before you know I feel ready\nto to Really lay it on the on the table\nand\nsay you should absolutely buy this it's\nit's well worth it but we're getting\nvery very close I would say great what\nabout thermal manipulations temperature\nI mean there's such a tight relationship\nbetween temperature and sleep and and\nwakefulness for that matter uh what sort\nof Technologies tools protocols exist to\nuh that use thermal manipulation as a\nway to augment sleep I love this topic\nbecause there are high-fi low-fi and noi\ntechnologies that you can\nuse the story of sleep and temperature\nas you mentioned before and\nreiterated in terms of the three-part\nstanza that tur set that I would\ndescribe is again you need to warm up to\ncool down to fall asleep you need to\nstay cool to stay asleep you need to to\nwarm up to wake up what that refers to\ntechnically in sleep science are what we\ncall the thermal trigger zones so\nwarming up to cool down to fall asleep\nis what we call the Sleep onset thermal\ntrigger Zone cooling down or staying\ncool to stay asleep is about the deep\nsleep trigger Zone and then warming up\nto wake up is the activating alertness\ntrigger\nZone studies if you looked at them to\nbegin with before they manipulated that\nfound something fascinating if I take\nyou Andrew huberman and I bring you into\nmy lab and I remove your phone all your\nlaptop and you say goodbye to your\nfriends and family and you I bring you\ninto the center and there are no cues as\nto what time of day no windows no\nnothing and I'm just going to say look\nI'll keep asking you\nbut at the moment that you feel most\nsleepy just let me\nknow it turns out that before that we'\ndone the um delightful um intervention\nof inserting a rectal probe into you\nbecause that's the best way that we can\nmeasure your core body temperature so\nwe're measuring your core body\ntemperature and sure enough despite you\nknowing nothing about what time it is\nthe moment that you will tell me I am\nready to go to bed and I am sleepy is\nthe moment when you are on the greatest\ndecelerating trajectory of your core\nbody temperature it is high highly\npredictive of how sleepy you will feel\nthe way that your body does this is by\npushing blood out to the surface regions\nof your skin notably your hands and your\nfeet because these are these highly\nvascular regions and you had a great\npodcast from one of my heroes and good\nfriend Craig hel who's done some amazing\nwork on this at Stanford so naturally as\nwe lie down blood races to our hands and\nour feet and also our head and we start\nto release that heat trapped in the core\nof our body and by releasing that heat\nat the surface our core body temperature\ndrops hence the outer surfaces of you\nhands feet and face have to warm up for\nyour core to cool down for you to fall\nasleep and in fact there was a great\nnature paper some years ago they just\nmeasured the temperature of someone's\nfeet and they looked at how quickly they\nfell asleep and when they fell asleep\nsure enough the warmer your feet the\nfaster you fell asleep why because the\nWarmness reflects the blood dilation and\nthe pumping out of the blood to the\nperiphery and then they did it in rats\nwhere they started to warm the pores of\nthe rats and the Rats fell asleep more\nquickly and I love this notion of again\nI we don't do an but kind of love the\nnotion of wrapping a beautiful little\nrat up in Cotton wall and I'm I'm\nwarming its feet with this pad and it's\njust Bliss out out and then poof he's\ngone his after she I respect their\nprivacy um so that was the early\nevidence that then led to a series of\nmanipulation studies the most notable is\nbrilliant it comes from a colleague uh\nin the Netherlands usan summeran and his\ngroup they created essentially what was\na a wet think about a wet suit but that\nwet suit is covered with all of these\nthin tubes almost like veins that go all\nover the suit to all territories of your\nbody and then what they would be able to\ndo is peruse water warm water or hot\nwater exquisitly to different parts of\nthe brain or the body cool amazing yeah\nno pun intended thank so what they did\nwas then they started to manipulate\nthese peripheral regions sort of and\nsure enough when they did this they were\nable to have indiv uals fall asleep 25%\nfaster and these were healthy\nindividuals who are normally sleeping\nwithin a very natural quick period of\ntime but they were able to Lop off 25%\nof that time simply by warming these\ncertain parts of the brain to lift the\nblood away from the core of the body and\nby doing that they\naccelerated the temperature core\ndeceleration and therefore increased or\naccelerated the the speed with which\nsleep arrived to those individuals sleep\nappeared with much greater alacrity than\nit would have done otherwise even though\nit was quick\nanyway so then not being satisfied with\nthat they moved on to the deep sleep\ntrigger Zone and this isn't you need to\nstay cool to stay asleep and here now\nthey started to just continue to cool\nthe core the central aspects of the\nbody what they were able to do is\nincreased the amount of deep sleep by\nsomewhere between 25 to look at some of\nthe data almost 40 minutes they were\nable to boost the amount of deep sleep\nwith the thermal manipulation and when\nthey were measuring the electrical brain\nwaves and they decompose those brain\nwaves even the power and the electrical\nquality of those slow waves was\nincreased very impressive too next not\nbeing satisfied with that they turned to\nolder adults for the reasons that we've\njust described what they found was that\nin those older adults when they were not\nmanipulated with this thermal\ntemperature in the second half of the\nnight there was a 50% probability that\nthey were going to be awake for some\npart of the second half of the night\nwhen they did the thermal manipulation\nthey dropped that number down to\n5% so they reduced a 50% probability of\nwaking up down to 5% in older adults and\nagain they improved the quality of their\ndeep sleep Think About by by the way why\nthat was so effective for older adults I\nguarantee you you've probably seen\nyou've been in a warm climate or you've\nbeen down on the beach you know here\nsort of um in Los Angeles and people are\nout in shorts and t-shirts or crop tops\nand then occasionally there will be\nsomeone and I love seeing these sites\nwhere you know a child is sort of\nWheeling along their elderly parents\nit's a beautiful sort of scene of caring\nbut the older adult they're not dressed\nin the same way that every one else is\ndressed on the beach they are wrapped up\nsome of them have a Woolen hat on why\nolder adults cannot Thermo regulate\nanywhere near as well as young adults is\nthat right and it's the reason that\nolder adults will always be saying I'm\nI'm just so cold and my hands and my\nfeet especially are always cold now\nthat's a problem for sleep because if\nyou cannot Vaso dilate at the level of\nyour hands and your feet you can't get\nthe blood out from the core you can't\ndrop your core body temperature as much\nand we started to understand from those\ntypes of data that part of the Aging\nsleep related problem equation is not\njust that the brain deteriorates in\nsleep related regions which we've been\ndoing most of our work on it's also part\nof a body equation and a thermo\nregulatory equation there was also a\ngreat study unrelated from Australia\nthey looked at insomnia patients and\nthey put their hands or their feet in\nwarm water and by doing that it's a\nmanipulation you can see how quickly\ntheir hands and their feet what we call\nvasod dilate fill with\nblood healthy people phaso dieted very\nquickly in response to that warm water\nmeaning that their hands and their feet\nsort of you know had this red or at\nleast for my feet they would be this red\ntone to them however in the insomnia\npatients they did not Vaso dilate\nanywhere near as well so once again it\nsuggests that when you have problems\nwith Sleep part of the equation may be\nthat you have imper Thermo regulatory\nability and we do see this in insomnia\npatients so that's that was I think a\nbrilliant causal manipulation the\nproblem is that most of us don't have\naccess to a sort of come to bed eyes\nthermal suit so what can we do as a\ncon please don't cut that I get myself\ninto terrible trouble rightly so I\nshould I should be punished you'll be\nright what they did then was to say well\nokay let's look at this is there\nsomething that we could do that's\ncheaper and more accessible to the\ngeneral public and if you look there's a\nliterature that preceded that\nmanipulation and it's so reliable that\nwe now have a term for it in sleep\nscience it's called the warm bath effect\nand many people will say look I love to\nhave a a warm bath or a hot shower\nbefore bed and I think when I get out\nI'm nice and toasty and it's because I'm\nnice and warm that I fall asleep and I\nstay asleep it's the exact opposite when\nyou get out of the warm bath or the\nshower you have once again vasod dilated\nat the surface of your skin you get out\nof the bath you get this huge thermal\ndump of heat away from the core what\nhappens you fall asleep and you stay\nasleep more soundly now there are other\nreasons that that has a benefit it's\nrelaxing you decompress you're staying\naway from technology Etc but that is one\nof the the thermal benefits and in fact\nthere were Studies by a legend in my\nfield who passed away just a few years\nago um Jim horn at lury University in\nthe UK and they did some of these\npioneering studies they were able to\nimprove the amount of deep sleep by\nalmost 40 minutes in some individuals\nwhat was the protocol there as I recall\nI think they were in the bath for\nsomewhere around or the bath duration\ntime was somewhere around 30 minutes but\nthey were doing sort of segments where\nit was maybe it was 40 minutes 10\nminutes in and then you could sort of\nget out I think the temperature because\nit was UK was around about 40°\ncelsus somewhere in that region I may be\ngetting those numbers wrong because I\nknow we like to protocolized some of\nthis but they were able to show some\nreally Pleasant benefits to to Deep\nSleep it also helped people fall asleep\nhelped them fall asleep by about 25\nminutes faster in those people who are\nreally having a hard time with sleep I'm\ngoing to take a hot bath tonight I\nsometimes do the sauna in the evening\nbefore sleep I'm a big fan of cold in\nthe morning cold shower cold Plunge in\nthe morning reverse engineering the the\nequation you're trapping the heat into\nthe core of your body you're waking\nyourself up right and then the and in\nthe evening I've used sauna the one\nissue with sauna is I really crank the\nheat of the sauna and then sometimes if\nyou do that right before bed you take a\nyou know warmish shower right afterwards\nyou get into bed oftentimes I'll wake up\nthirsty and then um because it\ndehydrates you and then if I drink a lot\nof water to hydrate after in the sauna\nthen I'm waking up too much in the\nmiddle of the night so I think sauna is\ngreat but um right before bed I try I\nwould love to I don't have a a sauna at\nhome or nor an access to I mean there\nare saunas in and around where I live\nbut what I want to do is have it\nproximal to my bedtime and my bedtime\nbecause I'm a neutral type you know sort\nof around 11-ish nowhere is open and\nwilling to allow me to sit in the how\nlong do you you sit in there usually I\nI'm a little Bonker about this I well if\nit's in the evening and I just want to\nrelax I would say maybe 20 30 minutes\nand I I tend to go really warm warmer\nthan I want to stay here P do pet our\nfriend I've done Sonic cold plunge with\npet he usually does it in the evening\ngoes Sonic cold Sonic cold Sonic cold\nokay uh warm shower um and I don't know\nhow many nights a week he's doing that\nbut terms of the temperature of the\nsauna you know generally somewhere\nbetween 175 and\n210° depending on how heat adapted you\nare but I think a hot bath is great or a\nnice hot shower yeah I've certainly done\nthat and when I'm traveling with jet lag\nI will absolutely that's part of my sort\nof jet lag protocol I'll make sure I do\nI'll because I don't really struggle too\nmuch with sleep at least at present but\nwhen I go through jet lag and I go back\nhome to to London of course it's tough\nthe worst The Living Daylights out of\nthat and do as much as I can so I think\nthat's probably the end of the the\nthermal story although we are now trying\nto see if we can take lowf fire\napproaches where we're going to do some\nfootw we're trying to develop some footw\ntechnology that can be built\ninto\num maybe a mattress and some mattress\ncompanies uh there are some great ones\nuh I know obviously Mato at 8 sleep and\nthey are they are doing amazing things I\nthink his company again I have no\naffiliation but I we connect very well\nand he's brilliant so they're doing\nsomething like that I do uh use and love\nmy eight sleep here's what I'd love\nsomebody to engineer and we got a lot of\npeople who listen to the podcast you\nthink about product\ndevelopment it would be wonderful to\nhave a portable pair of socks so that\nyou can use them when you travel or when\nyou go you know sleep anywhere at home\nor elsewhere that would warm your feet\nup at the beginning of the night so this\nis a place for us to recap warm up to\ncool down to fall asleep right stay cool\nstay cool to stay asleep and then warm\nup in the morning to wake up and so that\nis pretty straightforward to build into\na pair of socks somebody can do this\nsomebody do this okay uh so that's so\nwe've done electrical we've done thermal\nwhat\nabout auditory auditory so acoustic\nstimulation in a very similar way\nto electrical stimulation where you're\ntrying to Target that deep sleep and see\nif you a better analogy is probably a\nmetronome and you're trying to see if\nyou can kind of force the metronome\nfurther over back and forth with these\ntypes of Technologies so auditory\nstimulation came on the map again I\nthink probably yam born's group in\nGermany was some of the first to do this\nthey initially started with this same\ngeneralized approach where they would\ntake acoustic tones and they would first\nassess what is your level of aw weening\nthreshold so you would be asleep and\nthey would just have these tones very\nlight tones like a sort of ping ping and\nthey would gradually increase the volume\nup and they would look to see what is\nthe point where that volume of the tone\nwakes you up and then they understood\nyour specific threshold what's called an\nAwakening threshold and they would set\nthe volume to a sub Awakening threshold\ngreat so you've got that locked in place\nand now you start and they did this\nwithin the first 90 minutes of people\nfalling asleep they started to play\nthese sub Awakening level volume levels\nof tones but they were playing them at\nthis very slow frequency as if again\nthey're trying to syn and match the slow\ndancing Rhythm of the slow brain waves\nand sure enough in that first study and\nit was indiscriminate meaning they just\nset the tones PL like a metronome set\nthe tone set the and sorry set the\nvolume and then set the Cadence of the\nvolume the speed the frequency of those\ntones to just a little bit less than one\nHertz a little bit less than one cycle\nper second and then off you drifted to\nsleep and they played it for the first\n90 minutes cuz that's the rich phase of\ndeep sleep and they were able to\nincrease the amount of Deep Sleep\nsignificantly the problem in that first\nstudy was that they also did a memory\ntest because in all of these studies\nincluding my own even if I boost your\nsleep tonight Andrew hubman my next if\nthat's the result that you show me I\nhave four words for you as a scientist\nyes and so\nwhat is it functional because if I boost\nyour sleep but it doesn't change\nanything to you the organism the next\nday I'm going to suggest that that\nenhancement is Epi phenomenal not\nfunctional so it has to improve some um\nsome reasonable metric in wakefulness\nthat like improves improved memory um\nimproved uh task switching ability so\nit's outcome measures strength correct\nsomething yeah so even if I for example\nyou know lower your blood pressure with\na new drug if I'm not changing your\ncardiovascular disease risk then the\nquestion is why am I just continuing on\nwith the drug if it's not really\nchanging much same thing here and what\nthey found was that when they did the\nmemory test the next morning by\nenhancing that deep sleep there actually\nwasn't a memory benefit so perhaps what\nwas happening is that this was just\nnon-specific so again they then returned\nand now others have returned to the\nclosed loop mechanism where now I've got\nelectrodes on your head and I'm\nmeasuring your slow wave brain waves and\nliterally I am next door in the room and\nI'm watching those slow brainwaves go up\nand down and then I've got a computer\nalgorithm that is watching those\nwatching in quotes watching that too and\nit's predicting when the next wave is\ngoing to come and when it does auditory\ntone clicks Awakening you don't wake up\nand sure enough when you sort of tone\ninto the brain at that time you boost\nthe the size of that brain wave and once\nagain they boosted the size of those\ndeep sleep brain waves they also improve\nthose more quick burst of activity the\nsleep spindles and now sure enough they\nwere able to improve memory however if\nyou look at that paper and here's why I\nthink the first method may not have\nworked very well and why I don't suggest\npeople start trying to set this up\nthemselves when they kept stimulating\nthe\nbrain slow wave after slow wave after\nabout three or four strikes of the\nmetronome to boost those slow waves the\nbenefits stopped and if they kept going\nyou started to inhibit the amount of\nnaturally occurring deep sleep brain\nwaves why would it do this deep sleep\nbrain waves I told you in the first\nepisode are a Act of incredible neural\ncoordination it's Mass coordination now\none of the extreme versions of mass\ncoordinated propagated activity that is\nmaladaptive that is pathological is\ncalled an epileptic seizure and your\nbrain has in place for the most part\nstop gaps to prevent that type of spread\nof vast amounts of coordinated\nspontaneous electrical oscillations\nbecause the brain is such a conductive\ndevice that once you get it going you've\ngot to be careful because it may start\nto conduct out of control so we think\nthat these checks and balances that were\nin place even though you can\nartificially stimulate it for a while\nafter a while the brain\nsays you've got to back off for a while\nbecause this is getting a little bit out\nof control you do a breath pause and\nthen you restart again and you get the\nbenefit and then you breath pause so\nyou've got to do it a little bit\nintimately now you've got to read the\nwhat we call the supplemental materials\nof that paper you've got to go it's like\nthe fine print on a legal document if\nyou dig into it you can see that that\nwas the case but um it it wasn't\nnecessarily evident so those were really\nthe data\non acoustic stimulation and now with\nthis closed loop acoustic stimulation\nthat we've got going on it seems to\nprovide these nice\nbenefits some people then will probably\nbe asking what about these noise\nmachines what about white noise Etc\nI've taken a look at this and so far I\nthink for White Noise machines the data\nis\nequivocal there was a recent study\nreview article I think it looked at\nabout 37 different studies I could have\nthis wrong and what they found was that\nthere was no reliable robust directional\neffect of white noise machines on sleep\nsome studies demonstrated that it helped\nsleep some studies didn't change sleep\nsome studies suggested it may make sleep\na little bit worse just nothing reliable\nbut maybe it's masking external sound\ncorrect so I think if and the one of the\npositive studies in that scenario was a\nstudy that was done in New York City and\nit was in a region where there was a lot\nof um external sound pollution and noise\nas you could well imagine it's New York\nCity and sure enough that's where they\ngot some really nice benefits of the\nwhite noise machine so I think it is\nyou're right context dependent there was\na an interesting recent study that came\nout from uh eaman Learners group at uh\nthe University of Texas San Antonio and\nthey didn't use White Noise they used\npink noise now what's the difference\npink noise has a little less what we\ncall power or intensity in the higher\nfrequency ranges of the sound spectrum\nand it's more enriched in the slower\ndomain of that power Spectrum which you\ncould argue is a bit more fitting with\nsleep and I think this study may have\nbeen a nap study or I may be wrong but\nanyway what they found was that they\nincreased Total Sleep Time by I think it\nwas close to 30 minutes with the pink\nnoise they did not change the amount of\ndeep sleep but they did inhance the\namount of stage two non-rm sleep which\nwe have spoken about before and we will\nin subsequent episod epodes that is\nbeneficial for things like learning in\nmemory including motor skills and they\nincreased the amount of REM sleep to a\nmuch more modest degree but those\nchanges were significant so I'm not\ntrying to rule out noise machines right\nnow and I have no affiliation with any\ncompany or anything in that space um I\ndon't want to throw the baby out with\nthe bath water I just simply think that\nright now we don't have enough evidence\nbut as you and I know as scientists\nabsence of evidence is not evidence of\nabsence just because it doesn't exist\ndoesn't mean that I don't think that\nit's still a potential root these types\nof machines what about\nkinesthetic stipular uh tools protocols\num you know body position is something\nthat has an interesting relationship to\npropensity to fall asleep based on brain\ncooling that we talked about in another\nepisode but what about manipulation of\nthe body's mov movement um uh yeah what\nis there anything in that domain it\nsounds wacky at first yeah it does but\nbut I said it so you I still want to\nknow come on social media just be be\nnice be friendly um I would say that if\nyou look back in again the annals of\nhuman\nhistory from the very early Inception\nyou will see mentions of a child being\nrocked in a Manger or rocked in a crib\noften parents will have will take their\nyoung infant and you will quote unquote\nRock them to sleep and we as adults will\nsometimes get in a hammock and if you're\nrocked what happens you will fall as\nit's that prototypical image of someone\nwith their hat over their face and in a\nhammock and they've sort of fallen\nasleep so it was very clear that\nsomething was going on in this space and\nthen a group from the University of\nGeneva um led by another fantastic sleep\nscientist Sophie Schwarz did an epic\nstudy that again it's one of those\nstudies that I\nprobably once more wished I'd\ndone here's what they did they took a\nbed frame and then they suspended it on\nchains from the ceiling now stick with\nme I'm not going in that you know\nthere's no hot candle wax being applied\nhere don't worry I'll I'll keep it PG\nagain and then the next thing that they\ndid was connect a rotating arm to that\nbed at the side of the bed and that arm\nwould start to simply just push the bed\nlaterally from left to right left to\nright and they started just swinging the\nbed in a very controlled manner but here\nand I should ask Sophie exactly why they\nmade this choice they were rotating the\nbed not at this sort of around one Hertz\nwhich is what we've done with electrical\nstimulation or acoustic stimulation\nthey were doing it\nat25 Herz which is much slower still\nalmost imper is rocking you know once\nevery four seconds it's a very\nslow\nlull and sure enough what they found in\nthe first series of studies they did a\nnap study a 90-minute nap study when you\ndid this rocking Motion versus when the\nbed was still they increased the speed\nwith which people fell asleep they\nboosted the amount of deep sleep and\nthey boosted the amount of those sleep\nspindle oscillations that we described\nnot satisfied they then said well what\nhappens across a night of sleep they did\nit then across a night of sleep they\nreplicated the same findings and now\nthey got a memory benefit now the memory\nbenefit you could argue was modest it\nwas 10% of a memory improvement benefit\nwhen you woke up from sleep relative to\nthe already aable benefit that sleep\nnaturally gives when you're not rocking\nthe bed but you think well 10% if I were\nlet's say a student and I got you know a\nb and someone the professor said Look by\nthe way there is something that you can\ndo and we can increase your grade by 10%\nand you can get to an A or an A plus\ndepending on the grading system would\nyou take it would you take 10% benefit\nabsolutely you would s grade point\naverage in increase so it's it it isn't\ntrivial necessarily well I also I'm I'm\npositively surprised how important this\num but so what uh condition is for you\nsleep researchers you know that that an\nenhancement in say deep sleep or rapid\neye Moon movement sleep needs to\ntranslate to some Daytime benefit um in\norder to really get you guys excited but\nbut here's why I I think that's great\nit's always great to have a high\nthreshold for excitement um but one of\nthe things that that one could argue is\nthat you know there are only so many\ntests that you can have in a Laboratory\num of daytime functioning I think I am\non board the the fact that sleep is the\nBedrock of mental health physical health\nand performance so an improvement in in\nyou know sign a statistically\nsignificant Improvement in deep sleep or\nREM sleep to me just seems like that's\ngot to be good for something we might\nnot know what that something is to test\nin the laborat\nbut it could be that the threshold for\nimprovement of say gut microbiome\nproduction of neurotransmitters is you\nknow .1% Improvement in deep so we don't\nknow I made that up so don't quote that\nstatistic anyone but I so admire the the\nthe um kind of extreme thresholds of\nwhat you what gets you guys excited well\nno your point is a very good one because\nyou could argue based on what I just\nwent back and said regarding the\nexercise study with Ronda Patrick I've\njust reversed my own threshold logic I\nsaid to you well okay exercise was able\nto overcome some of the deficits that\noccur by way of sleep deprivation for\nyour blood sugar but don't assume that\nthat necessarily means it overcomes the\ndetriments the other detriments that\nyou'll have for your hormonal Health\nyour you know Thermo regulatory capacity\nyour cardiovascular disease your brain\nfunction so I've just said look simply\nyou know one thing doesn't mean that\nyou've assessed all things and now now\nI'm saying okay if you don't show that\nit improved that one thing then it's not\nfunctional but Matt by your own logic\nyou've said that but you didn't assess\nmany of the other things so even if it\ndidn't improve memory as you said it's\nthe Bedrock of all things\nHealth you need to assess all of them\nbefore you make your conclusion of the\nyes and so what failed test so you're\nabsolutely right to point that out um so\nwhat was interesting after that data\ncame out in humans which is usually the\nopposite way around they started to look\nin in animal models and you mentioned\nthe vestibular system this ability for\nus to understand motion and movement and\nthere's lots of mechanisms for that they\nlooked at mice and they started doing\nthis rocking again and sure enough the\nmice fell asleep faster but then they\nfound a strain of mice that did not have\nthe lateral vestibular sensation\nmechanism and they rocked them just the\nsame way zero change in their sleep\nbecause you could imagine well it's\nimportant to understand the mechanism\nhere is it that when you're rocking\nthere is it's not just about vestibular\nstimulation maybe that\nrocking sort of modestly changes\nfriction which changes temperature you\ncould come up with all sorts of wacky\nreasons this was a very clear C caal\nmanipulation of the lateral vestibular\nsystem and if that is not in place you\nfail to get the benefit so it clearly\nhas something to do with the vestibular\nsystem can I Venture a guess as to why\nthat is yeah I interrupted but in case\nthat happen to be right by some chance I\npreviously talked about the um the need\nto lose uh a sense of one's posture in\nrelationship to gravity in order to fall\nasleep right you have to go into this uh\nlack of propr receptive awareness in\norder to fall asleep propri reception\nbeing the knowledge of where one's limbs\nare relative to the body and body\nrelative to other surfaces and gravity\nyeah and um this is something that can\nbe accomplished in these uh you know\nflotation tanks and things like that um\nand other ways go to outer space but um\nthe cheaper version the cheaper version\num\nso could it be that the rocking at that\nvery slow frequency um is tapping into\nthe vestibular system in a way that that\npropri receptive feedback about body\nposition is somehow um uh starts to\nvanish and because I'm intrigued by this\nidea that you have to lose perception of\nyour body's positioning and and propr\nreceptive awareness in order to fall\nasleep uh and maybe your a description\nearlier of a protocol of going on a\nmental walk um in order to fall asleep I\nI just feel like these things are\nstarting to converge on on on some\nthemes here central Comm pathway that\ncould be the absence of I think it's\nentirely possible in some ways right now\nwe think that these two things are\nassociated that as you're falling asleep\ngradually you will lose propri receptive\nsensation okay\nbut simply the fact that two things are\nassociated doesn't necessarily mean\nthey're causal but your suggestion here\nis a very elegant way of testing that\nhypothesis which is that perhaps if you\ncould show that the symmetric of\nproprioception becomes compromised when\nyou start doing\nlateral sort of kinesthetic or movement\nstimulation that's a very powerful\ndemonstration that it's not just so here\nwith the study in the mice they lacked\nthe lateral vestibular sensation and you\nlost the Sleep benefit but maybe there's\none step down which is that when you\nlose that vestibular stimulation you\nlose the benefit on the thing that\nreally is augment ing the Sleep which is\nthe change in propr reception so this is\nthe first step in a chain of command and\nyou've missed the final common\ntransactor of that ingredient called\nbetter\nsleep and those I would say are probably\nthe the four current bastions of sleep\naugmentation hopefully that describes to\nlisteners the range of where sort of\nsleep 3.0 sleep enhancement 3.0 is going\nand also describes the way in which\nwhich we can come down the strata from\nhigh friction low friction to no\nfriction um and also in terms of cost\nwhere you can have high cost minimal\ncost low cost I mean hot bath or shower\nis Pennies on the dollars so especially\nif you take a cold shower in the morning\nand save on your heating bill so you can\ntake a little bit longer hot shower in\nthe evening and then you net the zero\ndifference um it's just my way of saying\ntake a cold shower in the morning feels\ngreat when you get\nout what about some ways to enh rapid\neye movement sleep beyond what you've\ncovered up until now so I think there\nare probably two emerging data sets that\nI've been intrigued by one of which\nwe've been doing some work on and it\ncomes back to Thermal what I fail to\nmention is not just that you need to\nwarm up to wake up which you do but you\nalso need to warm up to REM sleep but\nnot too much if you take an organism or\na human being and you strip them of bed\nsheets and strip them of clothes so\nthey're basically almost on\nnatural if you warm the body up to what\nwe call the Thermon neutral point so it\ntends to be and this sounds extreme and\nit you don't have to do this because\nyou're under sheets and that makes a\nworld of difference but if you warm the\nroom to about 30° C which gets close to\nat the surface ambient level for your\nskin something that can bring your core\nbody temperature up back up to operating\nbecause I told you when you go when\nyou're in that deep sleep trigger Zone\nthe middle Zone your core body\ntemperature drops and it drops\nsignificantly and to wake up you have to\nwarm up but on the journey to warming up\nyou also have to get to Thermon\nneutrality for you to have REM sleep if\nI keep you too cold I can reduce the\namount of REM sleep if I get you too hot\nbut I can imper the amount of REM sleep\nso it's a Goldilocks phenomenon not too\nlittle not too much just the right\namount if I keep you there in terms of\nyour thermal um net neutrality I can\nboost your RAM sleep now that's\nfishlyn they run at different hot\ntemperatures they've got different\npartner situations so you need a Clos\nloop system again but it's something\nthat very interested in because almost\nall of the methods that I've described\nand you are smart to pick this up all\ntarget deep non-rm sleep but we spoke\nabout in the first episode every stage\nof sleep is important and in subsequent\nepisodes I'll tell you exactly why REM\nsleep is so critical so how can we boost\nthat that's one way that was starting to\nexplore it but nothing I think solid yet\nthe other is some of the drugs the newer\nsleep medications that have come onto\nthe market and um again I think I\nmentioned I I did take the task and I\nfeel perhaps rightfully so about the\nclassic sleep medications that if you\nlook at the scientific data if you can\navoid them it's probably best to do so\nthings like ambient Etc we call them the\nZ drugs because they all start their\nsort of generic names are sort of start\nwith a zed you know\num ambian for example um has uh has a\nzed at the start of it for its generic\nname but but I don't want to get into\nnaming any\nnecessarily yeah but um for\nambient what's interesting about those\nmedications again they're are in a class\nof drugs that we call the sedative\nhypnotics so again sedation not sleep\nand also there's been some great work\nagain by D and dyin colleagues if I were\nto show you the that that electrical\nsignature of your deep sleep it does\nlook as though those drugs kind of\nincreased the amount of electrical\nactivity in that slower deep sleep range\nexcept once you go all the way to the\nfar left to the slowest of those slow\nbrain movies which turns out to be the\nthe types of waves that are most\nbeneficial for most health related brain\nand body functions you get this huge\ndent in your electrical brain wave\nactivity it's almost as though those\ndrugs take a bite out of that realm of\nof electrical activity and of course\nthere are issues with daytime sleepiness\nand some safety related issues that has\nbeen Health associations not necessarily\ncausal and so I was you know I I offered\none scientific Viewpoint of those\nmedications in the book and um and so be\nit it's not as though i' I'm anti-m\nmedication as I said and some of the new\nmedications are very interesting brings\nme back to REM sleep there's a new class\nof sleep medications called the Doras\nand it stands for it's d o r a small s\nand it stands for Jew\norexin receptor\nantagonists oh my goodness mouthful that\njust sounds like word salad to anyone\nwho's not a\nneuroscientist orexin which is part of\nthat um set of words is a chemical in\nthe brain and ereen became prominent\nwith the study of noopsy and what we we\nas the Royal Wii people like Emanuel\nMano and others um at Stanford what they\ndiscovered was that noptic patients have\na found deficit in this this chemical\norexin and receptors also called\nhypocretin and it has a function both it\nturns out for wakefulness and a function\nfor feeding and eating related behaviors\nhypocretin was probably more related to\nit when it was because it was discovered\nright around the same time um two\ndifferent groups yes exactly beautiful\ntwo different groups named it\ndifferently but noopsy as some people\nmay know is it's a condition to sleep\ndisorder and one of the symptoms is\ncalled excessive daytime sleepiness\nwhere you have inappropriate invasions\nof sleep during the day when you want to\nbe awake why well it turns out that this\nchemical ereen acts like a finger on the\nlight switch of all of the apparatus in\nyour brain that switches on to force you\nawake it reaches down into the it's\nreleased from a central part of your\nbrain called the hypothalamus and it\nreleases down into the brain stem to\nactivate what we call the ascending\narousal system or the reticular\nascending arousal system of the brain\nand when that lights up it's like the\nlight switch which says on for waking\nbrain activity and so what was happening\nwas that this ereen up higher up was not\nforcing the finger of wakefulness on\nduring the day so almost instead of a\nswitch which is what you\nwant it was more like a dimmer switch\nand you know when you get to that dimmer\nswitch point right in the middle where\nit's flickering it's on it's off it's on\nit's off that's almost the state in\nwhich the narcoleptic brain was because\nthey had a deficiency of orexin so that\nwas the ereen story in nopy so why is it\nrelevant for insomnia well people\nrealized the problem with Epsy is that\nthey're asleep during the day when they\nwant to be awake but the opposite\nproblem is true of insomnia patients\nthey want to be asleep at night but\nthey're awake so why don't we\nselectively de develop a drug that goes\nafter this finger that flips the light\nswitch on for wakefulness but now let's\nblock it at night so we flick the switch\nback in the off position we turn out the\nlights of the brain and we remove the\nproblem of insomnia which is excessive\nwakefulness at night which is one of its\nproblems but and therefore when you\nremove that indirectly what comes in its\nplace is this thing called more\nnaturalist sleep and that's why it's\nbeing more favored now as the principal\ndrug um it's still not necessarily well\nknown by physicians or it's not very\nwell prescribed it's not very well\ncovered here in the United States\nunfortunately with insurance so it's a\nvery expensive option right now Health\nProviders will choose not to do that\nunfortunately so what's interesting\nabout that drug though is that it's\nmixed in terms of the studies but quite\nreliably it does seem to improve sleep\nvery much so but it seems to unlike\nthose classic sleeping pills which\nartificially look like they're\nincreasing deep sleep even though\nthey're they're not doing sedation these\ndrugs can improve most all aspects of\nsleep but including REM sleep which\nthose classic sleeping pills did not why\nis it doing that we still don't know but\none of the things that the these Dora\ndrugs do that block the erex in that\ntake off the the the on position of the\nlight switch and flip them off when you\nswitch it off it can actually then then\nallow the activation or the stimulation\nof something called melanin concentrated\nhor hormone or MCH in the brain and that\nwhen it is um triggered on can stimulate\nanother chemical called acety choline in\nthe brain which is a\nneurotransmitter if there is one\nneurotransmitter in the brain that seems\nto be responsible almost exclusively for\nthis thing called REM sleep or\ndominantly I should say for REM sleep it\nis atile Coline this was discovered way\nback in the 1970s by my former um uh one\nof my former mentors Alan Hobson at\nHarvard and what this drug may be doing\nis indirectly boosting the amounts of\nacetal choline in the brain particularly\nin a region of the brain called the\nbasil forbrain which is a REM sleep\nregulating region and that's the reason\nthat you get boosts in REM sleep and\npeople also report dreaming a little bit\nmore too on those medications so thermal\nmanipulation getting you to net neutral\nthermal zones helps increase REM sleep\nbut also there are some medications that\nwere not necessarily designed for REM\nsleep enhancements selectively but there\nis evidence that they do that so if you\nask me where are we at with REM it's\nit's certainly more bereft of methods\nthan deep non-rem sleep but we are\nstarting to find some now given what you\njust told us about the role of ACL\ncholine in Rapid eyee movement sleep\nwhat about taking um precur cursors to\nacetylcholine I mean certainly a good\nnumber of them exist yeah um you know\neven like over-the-counter supplements\nlike Alpha\nGPC um and then of course there are uh\ncholine donors and things like that that\ncan increase uh col energic transmission\num is that get into issues of um you\nknow if one does that globally is it\npossible that you increase arousal and\nhave trouble falling asleep because some\nof those coleric agents be activating so\none of the problems the second\nis you may stop because you're going to\nhave to take them before bed you may\nBrute Force REM sleep to arrive earlier\nand you may therefore come at the cost\nof of deep non-rem sleep and so you'd\nhave to get uh some kind of timed\nrelease capsule which you can do you can\ncoat these capsule you can get a timed\nrelease and you would want to take it\nbefore bed and then maybe after about\nfour or five hours you would want to\nkick it into gear because now you're in\nso it's a littleit gets bit tricky yeah\nthis is one of the reasons why I\npersonally this is just my experience\nI'm not a fan of of supplements that tap\ninto the serotonergic system for sake of\nsleep because um certainly serotonin\nplays an important role in sleep but\nanytime I've taken something you know\n5htp or something like that to try and\nimprove sleep I find that um I fall\nasleep and then I wake up very deep deep\nsleep and then I wake up um very alert\nand I have trouble with the later phases\nof sleep and I think that is because yes\nserotonin is involved in sleep but it's\ninvolved in sleep at a very specific\npoint in this as you refer to it this\nlike Symphony or ballet of different\nsleep stages and how they evolve and um\ninterdigitate with one another across\nthe night so um while I do think there\nare things that one can use\npharmacologically or supplement based to\nimprove sleep generally I I like to\nthink of those as the kind of thing that\nkind of pushes a away front of the whole\nsleep process yeah as opposed to trying\nto tap into one specific\nneurotransmitter within the sleep\nballet exactly yeah I I like that way of\nthinking and you you do have to be\ncareful because in biology it's often\nrare that there are any free lunches in\ntruth you know Nature has optimized our\nsystem so exquisitly that when you start\nto try and gain the system for one thing\nbe very mindful that it may come at the\ncost of something else and that's why\nwhenever we're doing these types of sort\nof developments of Technologies for\nsleep we are very cautious not just to\nsay did we improve the thing that we're\ntargeting but first call of business in\nmedicine is not will this drug help you\nbut firstly is there any downside in\nterms of will this drug hurt you and\nthen you have to understand the cost\nratio benefit between those two things\nyeah just one more anecdote uh that is\nin agreement with what you said nowadays\nthere's an increased excitement around\npeptides the use of peptides there is um\nand I I currently don't use any but I\ndid a short run with you know occasional\nuse of cellin which is a secretagogue\nwhich is a growth hormone right SEC it\npromotes the secretion of growth hormone\nnot growth hormone itself I took it not\nmany times and I was tracking my sleep\nand what I noticed is it um put me into\na little bit of a hypnotic State dreams\nwere very intense but um deep deep sleep\nbut according to my sleep tracker I only\nran this for maybe three nights um\naccording to my sleep tracker it\ncompletely eliminate all my rapid eye\nmovement sleep at least as measured by\nthe sleep tracker but the amount of of\nDeep Sleep of slow wave sleep just like\nmassively expanded so that that can't be\ngood that that can't be good I mean know\nyou don't want to mess with that\ncocktail ratio that we described in the\nfirst\nepisode presume that it's it's emerged\nas the correct you know Da Vinci Code of\nsleep stage recipes and there may be a\ntime and a place where you want to over\nindex on one of those things for\nwhatever reason but to do it\nconsistently and permanently I would\nagain say if if you think within the\nspace of a\nlifetime\nthat you know something that you know\n2.6 million years of evolution has not\nunderstood chances are you're probably\nwrong I agree um um and certainly later\nin this series we will touch into some\nof the over-the-counter supplements and\nother things that one can do in order to\naugment sleep that do seem to have some\nbenefit because there are uh such things\num but in the\nmeantime thank you for providing this\nincredible Arc of description of basic\nsleep hygiene and regularity
