    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the hubman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine today's episode marks the first\nin our six episode series all about\nsleep our expert guest for this series\nis Dr Matthew Walker professor of\nneuroscience and psychology and the\ndirector of the center for Sleep science\nat the University of California Berkeley\nhe is also the author of the bestselling\nbook why we sleep during the course of\nthe six episode series for which we\nrelease one episode per week starting\nwith this episode one we cover\nessentially all aspects of sleep and\nprovide numerous practical tools to\nimprove your sleep for instance we\ndiscuss the biology of sleep including\nthe different sleep stages as well as\nwhy sleep is so important for our mental\nand physical health we also talk about\nhow sleep regulates things like\nemotionality and learning and\nneuroplasticity that is your brain\nability to change in response to\nexperience and we discuss the various\nthings that you can do to improve your\nsleep everything from how to time\nlighting temperature exercise eating and\nthe various things that can impact sleep\nboth positively and negatively such as\nalcohol cannabis and various supplements\nand drugs that have been shown to\nimprove sleep we also talk about naps\ndreaming and the role of dreams and\nlucid dreaming which is when you dream\nand you are aware that you are dreaming\nin today's episode one we specifically\nfocus on on why sleep is so important\nand what happens when we do not get\nenough sleep or enough quality sleep we\nalso talk about the various sleep stages\nand we also talk about a very specific\nformula that everyone should know for\nthemselves called qqr T which is an\nacronym that stands for Quality quantity\nregularity and timing of sleep four\nfactors which today you'll learn how to\nidentify specifically for you what your\noptimal qqr is and then to apply that in\norder to get the best possible night's\nsleep which of course equates to the\nbest possible level of focus and\nalertness throughout your days both Dr\nWalker and I are very excited to share\nthe material in the six episode series\nwith all of you and as we March into\ntoday's episode one I'm sure it will\nboth provide a ton of excellent\npractical learning for all of you as\nwell as spark many questions that are\nsure to be answered in the subsequent\nepisodes of this series before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\neight sleep eight sleep makes Smart\nmattress covers with cooling Heating and\nsleep tracking capacity many times on\nthis podcast we discuss how in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually needs to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling maximally refreshed and\nenergized your body temperature needs to\nheat up by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmakes it very easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nso that it's easy to fall and stay\nasleep and wake up feeling refreshed I\nstarted sleeping on an eight- Sleep\nmattress cover several years ago and it\nhas completely and positively\ntransformed my sleep so much so that\nwhen I travel to hotels or airbnbs I\nreally miss my eight sleep I've even\nshipped my eight sleep out to hotels\nthat I've been staying in because it\nimproves my sleep that much if you'd\nlike to try eightsleep you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman to save1 15 off their pod

betterhelp\nbetterhelp offers Professional Therapy\nwith a licensed therapist carried out\nonline now I've been doing therapy for\nwell over 30 years initially I had to do\ntherapy against my will but of course I\ncontinue to do it voluntarily over time\nbecause I really believe that doing\nregular therapy with a quality therapist\nis one of the best things that we can do\nfor our mental health indeed for many\npeople it's as beneficial as getting\nregular physical exercise the great\nthing about better help is that it makes\nit very easy to find a therapist that's\noptimal for your needs and I think it's\nfair to say that we can define a great\ntherapist as somebody with whom you have\nexcellent Rapport somebody with whom you\ncan talk about a variety of different\nissues and who can provide you not just\nsupport but also insight and with better\nhelp they make it extremely convenient\nso that it's matched to your schedule\nand other aspects of your life if you'd\nlike to to try

drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans plenty of the electrolytes\nmagnesium potassium and sodium and no\nsugar as I've mentioned before on this\npodcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want\nto be clear people who already consume a\nlot of salt or who have high blood\npressure or who happen to consume a lot\nof proc say foods that typically contain\nsalt need to control their salt intake\nhowever if you're somebody who eats\npretty clean and you're somebody who\nexercises and you're drinking a lot of\nwater there's a decent chance that you\ncould benefit from ingesting more\nelectrolytes with your liquids the\nreason for that is that all the cells in\nour body including the nerve cells the\nneurons require the electrolytes in\norder to function properly so we don't\njust want to be hydrated we want to be\nhydrated with proper electrolyte levels\nwith element that's very easy to do what\nI do is when I wake up in the morning I\nconsume about 16 to 32 ounces of water\nand I'll dissolve a packet of element in\nthat water I'll also do the same when I\nexercise especially if it's on a hot day\nand I'm sweating a lot and sometimes\nI'll even have a third element packet\ndissolved in water if I'm exercising\nreally hard or sweating a lot or if I\njust notice that I'm not consuming\nenough salt with my food if you'd like\nto try element you can go

Walker Dr Matt Walker\nwelcome Dr hubman it's an absolute\nprivilege and a delight to be back\nthat's right you've been on here before\nbut I have during this episode in this\nseries we are going to go a lot deeper\nby the way you look very well rested\nthank you very much I actually slept\npretty well last night um despite it\nbeing a foreign location um same time\nzone that helps just astronomically\namazing well rather than ask you what a\ngreat night's sleep is for you because\nI'm pretty sure you're going to tell us\nthat there's uh some individual\ndifferences that people need to pay\nattention to in terms of what is quote\nunquote optimal sleep let's start off\nwith the\nbasics what is sleep so sleep I think in\nsome ways you can Define as at least in\nhumans and in fact in all mamalian\nspecies is broadly separated into two\nmain types of sleep on the one hand we\nhave something that many people will\nhave heard of called nonrapid ey\nmovement sleep or non-rem sleep for\nshort and non-rem sleep has been further\nsubdivided into four separate stages and\nthey are unimaginatively called stages\none through four increasing in their\ndepth of sleep so stages three and four\nthat that's the really deep sleep that\nwe can speak about and I should explain\na little bit at some point what happens\nduring that state with in the brain it's\nstunning it's astonishing so you've got\nstages one and two light non-rm sleep\nwhen you sort of look at your sleep\ntrackers and it has light nonrem deep\nnonrem and then REM stages one and two\nthat's light nonr stages three and four\nthat's deep nonr and that's non-r\nencapsulated on the other hand we have\nrapid eye movement sleep or remm sleep\nand it's named not after the um popular\nMichael styp band of the 1990s but\nbecause of these bizarre horizontal\nshuttling eye movements that occur\nduring this stage of sleep hence the\nrapid eye movements and REM sleep is the\ndepending on your definition and we'll\nprobably come to this in in uh later\nepisodes It's the principal stage in\nwhich we dream but if your definition is\nquite loose which is any reported mental\nactivity when I wake you up or when you\nwake up then it turns out that we dream\nin almost every stage of sleep but I'll\ndescribe REM sleep from here on in as\nperhaps you dream sleep and I'll make\nthat faux part so you've got these two\ntypes of sleep non-rem and REM\nsleep they will then play out in this\nbeautiful battle for brain domination\nthroughout the night and that cerebral\nwar is going to be won and lost on\naverage for the average adult every 90\nminutes and then it's going to be\nreplayed every 90 minutes and that\ncreates the standard cycling\narchitecture of sleep so whoever is\nlistening to this when your head hits\nthe pillow tonight what will happen\nyou'll start to go down into the light\nstages of non-rm then you'll go down\ninto the deeper stages of non-rm sleep\nand you'll stay there and after about 45\n50 60 Minutes you'll start to rise back\nup again and then you'll pop up and\nyou'll have a short REM sleep period and\nthen back down you go again down into\nnon-rem sleep and up into REM sleep and\nas I said you cycle through that on\naverage about 90 minutes but I'll come\nback to that what's interesting however\nis the ratio of non-rem to REM within\nyour 90minut cycle is not stable and\nwhat I mean is as you move across the\nnight the the the domination of those\ntwo types of sleep within the 90-minute\ncycle changes such that in the first\nhalf of the night the majority of those\n90 minutes Cycles are comprised of lots\nof deep non-rem sleep but very little\nREM sleep but as we push through to the\nsecond half of the night now that ratio\nbalance that seesaw balance shifts over\nand instead we have much more rapid ey\nmovement sleep and very little deep\nsleep so when people think about okay I\njust go to sleep I lose Consciousness my\nbrain is still firstly nothing further\nfrom the truth could be the case in in\nterms of your sleep second your sleep\nhas a very specific pattern that has\nconsequences to real life so let's say\nthat you're someone who normally gives\nyourself an8 hour sleep opportunity in\nbed but the next morning based on what\nI've just told you you say okay well I\nwant to I'm going to get a jump start on\nthe day or I've got an early morning\nflight so I'm just going to come up with\nnumbers here I'm not suggesting that\nthis is the ideal sleep schedule by any\nmeans but just to make the numbers\nsimple let's say someone normally goes\nto bed at midnight and wakes up at 8: so\nthere's their 8h hour opportunity but\ntoday they're going to wake up at 6:00\na.m. rather than 8:00 a.m. to get this\npush on the day how much sleep have they\nlost well technically they've lost 2\nhours of the 8 hour so they've lost\n25% but that's not entirely true they\nmay have lost 25% of their total sleep\nbut because of the strange structure of\ndeep sleep first and then REM sleep\nlater they may have lost 60 70 maybe 80%\nof their REM sleep so I only make this\npoint because understanding how sleep is\nstructured can have\nconsequences I will come back to the 90\nminutes though it's fascinating we've\noften and some people probably have\nheard this before it's a 90minut cycle\nwell there's huge variability some\npeople can have a sleep cycle on average\nthat's maybe 75 minutes others 120\nMinutes is it consistent within an\nindividual it is relatively stable\nwithin an individual so I would say that\nthe size of the difference from one\nindividual to the next is much bigger\nthan the size of the difference within\nan individual from one night to the next\nto the next not unlike a healthy\nmenstrual cycle in a woman which can\nrange from a short is you know 24 days\nto 31 days and still be considered a\nhealthy cycle that regular but and it\nwill change across the lifespan of\ncourse but for a good number of years\nit's going to be pretty consistent\nwithin a given woman uh and yet Between\nWomen it can vary quite a bit immensely\nyeah and what's also interesting is that\nspeaking about um some sex specific\nthings there are sex differences so on\naverage men if you look at them will\nhave a sleep cycle that's about 15 to 20\nminutes longer than women which on a\n90-minute average is actually quite a\nlot and I bring this point up because\nyou may have seen some of those sort of\nclaims or devices out there well firstly\nprobably on social media and people send\nme these things and say is this true\nwhich is you really have to structure\nyour wakeup time at these very distinct\n90minut on the clock when the clock\nstrikes the 90-minute midnight you know\nthat's when you have to be waking up and\nyou should set your alarm right these\nthe the rational you'll tell me that\nit's wrong presumably but the rationale\nof those devices is that one would be\nbetter off waking up at the end of a\n90-minute cycle as opposed to in the\nmiddle of a 90-minute\ncycle even if it means getting less\ntotal sleep because the argument is that\nwaking up at the end of a 90-minute\ncycle allows one to be more alert upon\nwaking right that there's something\nuniquely special about the completion of\na 90-minute cycle that will have you Ed\nout of sleep feeling like an Energizer\nBunny kind of that's some of the claims\nthat they and if I were to ask now true\nor false false so sleep for as much as\nyou possibly can sleep don't terminate\nthat sleep artificially on the basis of\nanyone telling you that there is this\nkind of Da Vinci Code magic 90 minutes\nthat's unfortunately not true and I you\nknow I've been guilty of saying you know\nit's a 90minut cycle and repeating that\nso if I didn't know any better I would\nbelieve that so I'm not trying to you\nknow chasti anyone I'm just simply\nsaying be aware of that and don't worry\ndon't stress about this unique 90-minute\ncycle and there's some products out\nthere that say they're going to time you\non your 90-minute cycle and wake you up\nI would probably stay a little bit clear\nof some of those what about going back\nto sleep you said to get um as much\nsleep as possible if I get six hours of\nsleep and then wake up and I feel like I\ncould go back to sleep would I be better\noff going back to sleep provided that my\nwork schedule allows for that or um is\nit the case that after you've gotten a\ncertain amount of sleep that's a good\nidea to get up and and go I would say\nthat if you feel as though there's still\nmore sleep in you MH there is\nor I love that this has become\nbiographical instantly it's going to be\na good episode when that happens I would\nsay hold tight stay in bed with an\nasterisk that I'll come back to and see\nif you can get get back to sleep and we\ncan speak about different ways of\nhelping you do that\nbut the reason I put a a slight asterisk\nthere is the following if you're then in\nbed for the next 45 50 minutes wide\nawake the danger and it doesn't happen\nto everyone but the danger is that you\nstart to associate this thing called\nyour bed with this thing called\nwakefulness and not sleep and one of the\nthings that we do in cognitive\nbehavioral th y for insomnia is we try\nto prevent you from spending long\nperiods of time awake and I would say\nit's probably about a 25 minute rule of\nthumb it's not a rule it's a rule of\nthumb if after about 25 minutes you just\ncan't seem to catch it and this is\nhappening frequently I would just be\nmindful of you then starting to build a\nbonded Association in your brain that\nyour bed is also the place of being\nawake the analogy would\nbe you would never sit at the dinner\ntable waiting to get hungry so why would\nyou lie in bed waiting to get sleepy and\nthe answer is that you you shouldn't and\nso we need to break that Association now\nthere's nothing stopping you however\nfrom saying there's still sleep in me I\nknow that there is so I'm just going to\nget out of bed go to a different room\nI'm just going to read a book listen to\na podcast and then only when I feel\nsleepy I'm going to go back to bed\nbecause my schedule allows for it that's\nthe best way I would tell you if you\nstill think the sleep that on the table\nto try and get it back that's immensely\nvaluable uh knowing that there's sort of\na conditioned Place effect of of being\nawake in bed um I must say I get pretty\ngood sleep most of the time there have\nbeen phases of life including recently\nwhere sleep has been challenging and I\nnotice as I head toward the bed to go to\nsleep recently the words in my mind are\nhere's the battle Gra like it's going to\nbe a night of going to sleep waking up\ngoing to sleep waking up we'll get to\nthis business of of continuity of sleep\na little bit later so we don't have to\ngo into that now but I I should also\nnote by the way that for some people\nwhen I speak with them they will and\nit's just because you you mention it\nit's beautiful they will be saying I I'm\nso surprised because I am watching\ntelevision and I'm falling asleep on the\ncouch and then I get into bed and I'm\nwide awake and I don't know why and\nthat's because in part you've built this\nthis connection in your brain and it's\nand when you go into the bedroom that's\nwhat we try to do with cognitive\nbehavioral therapy for insomnia you\nspoke about it as a Battleground that\nit's almost this adversarial thing which\nin some ways infers that at that point\nyou feel as though your sleep controls\nyou and it is a miserable feeling and\ngradually over time what we would do is\nwork with someone and at that point now\nyou control your sleep your sleep\ndoesn't control you and that is so your\nfreedom when you get it but sorry I\ninterrupted you oh no uh I interrupted\nyou but um thank you yeah I've prided\nmyself my whole life on being able to\nsleep anytime anywhere uh I learned it\nfrom my Bulldog Costello or maybe that's\nwhat brought us together because he\ncertainly had that I'm so sad he's not\nhere around anymore with us CU I would\nhave loved to he feels like he is the\nbest sleep Ambassador if there's a post\nto child for good sleep well he's here\nin spirit um sleeping um so this is\ninteresting and I think it's important\nfor people to hear if if you can't fall\nasleep or if you wake up in the middle\nof the night and you can't fall back\nasleep pretty quickly after about 20\nminutes or so probably best to get out\nof bed um so these 90 minutu is\ncycles that include different types of\nsleep um prompt me to ask if you were to\ndescribe the basic characteristics of\neach of those four stages of sleep and\nespecially the deeper stages three and\nfour and REM sleep not just at the level\nof Rapid Eye movements during REM sleep\nbut in terms of the types of Dreams or\nthe characteristics of of kind of bodily\nState and you know maybe you just flesh\nout the physiology and neurochemistry\nand you know touch on kind of the the uh\ndream features associated with each of\nthese uh different stages of sleep this\njust gets so exciting to me and even now\nwhen I go into the lab where I look at\nsleep traces um from my sleep center it\nI'm am still in awe in bewildered awe of\nwhat the brain does so as we start to\nfall into those lighter stages of sleep\nonce you get past stage one sleep which\nis sort of almost the shallows where\nyou're just wading out um then you go\ninto stage two sleep and one of the\nHallmarks of stage two non-rem sleep or\nsomething called sleep\nspindles and the way that we measure\nsleep in a laboratory by the way is that\nwe place you look like a spaghetti\nmonster you've got all of these\nelectrodes on your head you've got\nthings above your eyes and you've got\nthings on your body and we're\nessentially measuring three main signals\nelectrical brain activity we're\nmeasuring muscle activity and we're\nmeasuring eye movement activity and I'll\nexplain why those three things are\nnecessary for me to know are you awake\nare you in sleep and if you're in sleep\nwhich stage of sleep you're in so going\ninto that stage two non-rem sleep we've\ngot these sleep spindles and at that\npoint I'm looking at the electrical\nsignals from your brain what we call the\nEEG or the electri\ninogram and these sleep spindles are\nthese beautiful short synchronous bursts\nof electrical activity and they last for\nabout a second to two seconds maybe a\nlittle\nlonger and they are bursting at a what\nwe call a frequency of somewhere between\n12 to 15 Hertz and what that means is\nthat these brain waves are going up and\ndown 12 to 15 times per second that's\nwhat our measure is 12 to 15 Hertz\nand then you go back and your brain at\nthat point has started to slow down now\nwhen we're awake your brain wave\nactivity can be going up and down maybe\n20 30 40 times per second it's very fast\nand frenetic it's actually very chaotic\nelectrical brain activity but as we're\ngoing into these lighter stages of sleep\nthen the brain starts to slow down and\nat that point in stage two nonrem it's\nmaybe going up and down just four to\neight times per second so a huge\ndeceleration in terms of brain wave\nactivity but occasionally you'll get\nthese s of it's\ngoing and then you'll get these\nbeautiful bursts of these sleep spindles\num I actually did I I've never published\nit publicly or um we did a project\ncalled the sonification of sleep and we\ntook these electrical signals and then\nwe turned them into sound waves and you\ncan actually hear this beautiful sort of\nthis it's almost this beautiful\nthrobbing of a Slowdown in your brain\nand then you'll hear these spindles\nalmost sounds like that beautiful\ndelicious rolling R in Hindi so this\nit's just wonderful I'm not sure I can\ndo that R how's it\ngo yeah not too bad not not too bad I\nmean we're ering on the side of feline\nbut that's okay Andrew um so so coming\nback to I'm so sorry um coming back to\nsleep we've gone into light stage two as\nI'm trying to desperately hold it\ntogether um and we're going down into\ndeeper non-rm sleep now something\nspectacular happens and this is where I\njust almost lose it every time I see it\nthe brain now goes back down and it's\nspeed of of oscillation of going up and\ndown is maybe just one or two times per\nsecond it's incredibly slow and this is\nwhole brain activity or localized\nactivity this is so we'll come on to\nthis first the way we would measure it\nis just from these electrodes which are\nmeasuring hundreds of thousands of brain\ncells underneath them so a good analogy\nwould be let's say you're at a a\nfootball stadium and it's Stanford\nplaying Berkeley in in American football\nand what we've got is a single\nmicrophone dangling over the middle of\nthe stadium and that microphone is\npicking up the summed voices of the 60\n70,000 people underneath it's the same\nthing with when we place an electrode on\nyour head you're measure measuring the\nsummed activity of hundreds of thousands\nof neurons underneath but we've now\nstarted to use maybe 100 200 electrodes\non your head and we can pick these up in\nlocal territories of your brain but that\nbeautiful powerful slow brain waves um\nthat were getting during deep non-rm\nstages three and four it's not just slow\nactivity you would think okay that's\nthat that sounds like the brain is\ndormant no no no the brain at that point\nthe size of the w waves is almost\nquadruple maybe 10x the size of the\nbrain waves when you are awake why is\nthat meaning that the brain waves are\ngoing up and down very slowly but the\nsize of them which is what we call the\namplitude that is now huge it's epic so\nthink about it you're on the beach and\nwhen you're awake the waves are coming\nin very very quickly but they're small\nwaves and they're coming in in a random\nfashion but deep slow wave sleep are\nthese kind of Epic things that would\nhappen in Hawaii where you just get\nthese 20 30 foot waves and they're\ncoming in very slowly but they are\nepically big that is deep slow wave\nsleep and then what happens is riding on\ntop of those big slow waves are these\nsleep spindles they just keep coming so\naccording to the sort of the Sleep\nsonification project what you would hear\nnow these slow waves would\nbe that that's the slow wave and the\nSleep\nspindle what is it that happens in your\nbrain though to your question to produce\nthese slow waves well let's go back to\nthe football stadium analogy there\nbefore the game that's wakefulness\neveryone is having a different\nconversation in a different part of the\nstadium and and you just get this kind\nof incoherent sort of blabber that's\ngoing on that's wake your brain is doing\ndifferent things at different sort of\nlocations of the brain processing\ndifferent information at different\nmoments in time and that's the fast\nfrenetic activity of wakefulness when\nyou go into deep sleep all of a sudden\nfor reasons that we still don't quite\nunderstand hundreds of thousands of\nbrain cells in your cortex all decide to\nunite in their singular voice of firing\nand they all fire together and they all\ngo silent together they all fire\ntogether they all go silent together and\nthat's what's producing these huge big\npowerful waves so the analogy in the\nfootball stadium would be at this point\nnow and I'll I'll come across to um to\nto your University Stanford is is is\nwinning and the the crowd is buoyant and\nall of a sudden the Stamford crowd is\nsinging Berkeley sucks Burkle sucks and\nthey're all uniting the whole stadium\ncries out at the same time and then goes\nsilent at the same time it's an epic\ndisplay of coordinated neural activity\nin a way that we don't see in any other\nbrain State it's phenomenal it's just in\nall you answered the question I was\ngoing to ask which\nis does the pattern of brain activity\nthat you just described occur in similar\nor identical form during any waking\nStates and I think you just said the\nanswer is no meaning if I understand\ncorrectly this is a very very\nspecialized brain State unique to sleep\nunique to a specific portion of sleep\nand that begs the question what is it\ndoing so it turns out that all of these\nstages that we'll describe different\nstages of sleep do different things for\nyour brain and your body at different\ntimes of night and it's very\nunderstandable that people sort of in\nthe public will come over to me and say\nyou know how do I get more deep sleep or\nhow do I get more REM sleep and my\nquestion back to them firstly is why do\nyou want more REM sleep and they'll say\nwell isn't that the good stuff and I\nwill say well it turns out that they're\nall important you need all of them but\nwe can come on to let let I'll speak\nabout non-rem sleep functions first and\nthen I can probably I should unpack REM\nsleep um and then explain its functions\nbut as an overview what we know is that\nduring deep sleep first you switch over\nin terms of your body's nervous system\nto what we call the parasympathetic\nnervous system that you've spoke spoken\nabout a lot before which is this kind of\nvery quiescent calming state of your\nbody's nervous system the sympathetic\nnervous system which is very poorly\nnamed because it's anything but\nsympathetic it's very aggravating and\nactivating and um when we're awake that\nseems to be somewhat more dominant\ndepending on what state you're in but in\nsleep especially in deep Sleep you shift\nover into this very strong\nparasympathetic quiescent calm State and\nthat instigates together with other\nthings\num and we've demonstrated by the way\nthat we published a paper probably about\na year and a half ago that these slow\nwaves and these sleep spindles and the\ncordination of them how well that\nthey're coordinated seems to instigate a\nsignal down into your body's what we\ncall the autonomic nervous system which\ncarries both the sympathetic and the\nsympathetic nervous system inside of it\nand forces you over into a\nparasympathetic state so these brain\nwaves one of the things that they seem\nto be doing is transacting a message to\nyour body's nervous system to say calm\ndown quiet down what then happens\nfirstly what we see is your\ncardiovascular system ramps down deep\nsleep you could argue is almost the very\nbest form of blood pressure medication\nthat you could ever wish for it's\nbeautiful then something happens within\nyour immune system we're start starting\nto unpack this but we still don't quite\nknow why these pulsing deep slow brain\nwavves seem to be a trigger for\ninstigating two things for your immune\nsystem firstly it stimulates the\nrestocking of the Weaponry in your\nimmune Arsenal so that you wake up the\nnext day and you are a more robust\nimmune individual so these are things\nlike tea cells natural killer cells that\nsort correct all of that good stuff but\nwhat's also interesting there's a more\nrecent discovery um it's not just that\nyour body has um put back all of this\nArmory in place and in fact Amplified it\nbut your body\nsensitivity to those immune factors has\nalso increased so you've restocked the\nthe weaponry and you've made your body\nmore sensitive to those immune signals\nand that's why we will see in probably\nlater discussions your immune system can\nstart to become you know really markedly\nimpaired when you're not getting enough\nsleep so that's a second benefit of the\nDeep Sleep um brain wave patterns the\nthird benefit that we've realized is\nthat it's very good at regulating your\nmetabolic system and specifically your\nability to control your blood sugar and\nyour blood glucose and if we selectively\ndeprive you of just deep sleep alone and\nwe can do this now very cleverly it's\nnot as though I see you going into deep\nsleep and I go into your bedroom and I\nwake you up and then you go back to\nsleep and which is how we used to do it\nsort of 10 years ago now we can use a\nvery clever method where we play\nauditory tones to your brain but they\nare of a level that will not wake you up\nit's what's called a sub Awakening\nthreshold and we determine that and by\nplaying those tones it forces the brain\nto resurface out of deep sleep so you\nwill still sleep a total 8 hours but I\nwill have selectively excised just your\ndeep sleep and when I do that sure\nenough your blood sugar ability your\nability to control your blood sugar I\nshould say is impaired really quite\ndemonstrably and it's for at least two\nreasons the initial thing is that your\npancreas when it sees this spike in\nblood sugar it normally releases\nsomething called insulin and that\ninsulin is a trigger to your body to say\nstart absorbing the blood sugar so we\ndon't get this toxic or we don't\nmaintain this toxic spike in blood sugar\nyour pancreas when you are underslept\nand specifically when you're not getting\nenough deep sleep does not release the\nappropriate amount of insulin worse\nstill what we found is that's\nselectively depriving you of Deep Sleep\nmeans that what little insulin is\nreleased the cells in your body become\nless receptive to that insulin so you're\nnot releasing enough of this chemical to\nsay start absorbing blood sugar and the\ncells that are they designed to do the\nthey stick a straw out into your\nbloodstream and they suck up the blood\nsugar they don't respond to the insulin\nanymore so on both sides of the blood\nsugar regulation equation you become\nimper and then I can give you an example\nupstairs in the brain one of the things\nthat we found and we'll discuss is that\ndeep sleep helps regulate your learning\nin your memory functions it helps start\nto move memories around in your brain\nand protect them and shift them from\nshort term to long term deep sleep\nhowever we've now discovered is critical\nfor drisking your Alzheimer's trajectory\nit's during deep sleep when you have a\ncleansing system in the brain that\nstarts washing away the toxic proteins\nthat build up by way of wakefulness and\ntwo of those toxic components are\nsomething that we call beta ameloid and\nTow protein which are fundamental\ningredients in the Alzheimer's disease\nbrain equation\nso certainly I could then understand\nbased on that Litany of things that I've\njust provided and those are only a few\nof what deep sleep is doing you could\nimagine that's the stuff that I want to\nget and that's the thing that I need to\noptim for not true because there is REM\nsleep I'd like to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that\nalso contains adaptogens and is designed\nto meet all of your foundational\nnutritional needs by now I'm sure you've\nall heard me say that I've been taking\nag1 since 2012 and indeed that is true\nnow of course I do consume regular Whole\nFoods every day I strive to get those\nFoods mostly from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources how however\nI do find it hard to get enough servings\nof fruits and vegetables each day so\nwith ag1 I ensure that I get enough of\nthe vitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber\nand other things typically found in\nfruits or vegetables and of course I\nstill make sure to eat fruits and\nvegetables and in that way provide a\nsort of insurance that I'm getting\nenough of what I need in addition the\nadaptogens and other micronutrients in\nag1 really help buffer against stress\nand ensure that the cells and organs and\ntissues of my body are getting the\nthings they need people often ask me\nthat if they were going to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe and I always answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer you'll\nget five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman before you talk about REM sleep\num what about stages one and two of\nsleep are those just um kind of the jog\ninto the into the Sprint that is uh deep\nsleep stages three and four or if I were\nto Stage the question I'm asking as an\nexperiment let's say I'm an\nundergraduate or graduate student in\nyour lab and I say um can we do an\nexperiment where we selectively deprive\npeople of stage one and two sleep only\nand and then of course the question\nbecomes what do you put in there instead\nso there's a bunch of other experiments\nthat one would have to do but has that\nexperiment ever been done and if so uh\nwhat is the consequence of being stage\none two deprived um as opposed to just\ndeep sleep deprived so just as you\nalready um elegantly demonstrated that\nstage one selective deprivation is very\ndifficult because it's a denovo thing\nyou have to pass through to get to the\nother stages of sleep is stage one the\nstage of sleep that I and other people\nhave experienced many times where you're\nfalling asleep and um you start to have\na a dream perhaps about walking or\nrunning and then you kick yourself away\nthat's right okay oh and I should have\nexplained what happens stage one I love\nso as we're going into stage one\nobviously our eyelids are closed but one\nof the first signs that we know as we're\nrecording I told you we're recording the\nelectrical activity on the head with\nthese electrodes but I also said that\nwe're measuring IM movement activity and\nas you're going into light stage one non\nRAM for reasons that again we have no\nidea why your eyeballs start to roll in\ntheir sockets underneath your eyelids\nthat change that we can start to see we\ncall them Slow Rolling eye movements and\nthey are the Hallmark of you entering\nsleep and if you are lucky enough to\nhave a partner you can see this you can\nyou know as they're falling asleep you\nwill see these bizarre now granted if\nthey wake up usually the relationship\nhas terminated very quickly because the\nthing are you next time I'm on a plane\nif the person next to me is sleeping I'm\ngoing to be the guy kind of like you're\na mirror yeah no don't do that I'm the\nonly one who gets away with it cuz I'm a\ncard carrying sleep scientist and even\nthen yeah American Alliance sometimes\ntake some bridge but um so you get these\nSlow Rolling eye movements and the brain\nwaves start to to sort of slow down\nagain but you mentioned something else\nand they are called hypnogogic Jer and\nas we're going into this first stage of\nsleep I told you that the principal\nstage in which we dream is rapid eye\nmovement sleep that's not exactly true\nbecause everyone has had this experience\nthat just as you're drifting off you\nstart to have these little mini dreams\nalmost sort of diet or dreams light\nlit and you you you can almost wake\nyourself up based on the fracture point\nof cognition and what I mean is you're\nthinking okay so tomorrow uh I've got to\nget to the studio I'm interviewing that\ndesperately annoying British guy M\nWalker and then there was uh the\nelephant in the room with a helicop to\nthe wings on its head and and you almost\njust think it wakes you up because you\nthink wait wait sorry excuse me go back\nrewind what just happened that's the\npoint at which you've transitioned over\ninto the what we call the hypnogogic\nstate where you can have these\nhypnogogic dreams but you also get these\nJS we don't fully understand what\nhappens but the what we do understand is\nthat as you're going into sleep you\nstart to lose different aspects of your\nsensory perceptual apparatus not losing\nthe sense of where did I where did they\ngo and I can't find them but the the the\nprocessing of those now many will remain\nduring sleep one of the things that\nstarts to degrade is what we call\nproprioception and you've spoken about\nthis before which is knowing how your\nbody is sort of positioned in space so\nit propri reception is fascinating as\nyou're walking with a colleague and\nyou're crossing over a street have you\never had that feeling where you sort of\nyou step off the curb and you're\nchatting and all of a sudden you have\none of those really ugly wobbles where\nyou can oh and it's because you had\ncalculated non-consciously and\ncomputationally you understood where\nyour foot was in space you understood\nthe velocity force with which it was\ndescending down onto the road below you\nyou had miscalculated the distance and\nyour brain had expected your foot to hit\nthat that road at a certain time and it\ndid not it sends an error signal back up\nyour spinal cord and that's where you\nget that yeah this happened to me um uh\njust last weekend I was at the San\nFrancisco Zoo and periodically\nthroughout the landscape of the San\nFrancisco Zoo they have these kind of\nsquishy surfaces that are seamless with\nthe concrete around them I think this is\nso kids can play on the the various\nsculptures there and if they fall it's a\nlittle bit more forgiving so I was just\nwalking across this thing talking to the\nperson to my left and I stepped on this\nnow rather squishy surface and all of a\nsudden I'm like I don't know how to walk\nacross this thing and I'm you know I've\nbeen walking a long a long period of my\nlife and I really had to pay attention\nand then and then transition back onto\nthe concrete and could stop thinking\nabout it for a moment and you almost\nthen have to stop the conversation that\nyou were having because it takes over\nand you switch from non-conscious\nproceptive and you switch over so the\nissue is that when you are lying there\nawake in bed you sense the mattress\nunderneath you you sense the support\nyou're getting all of that feedback\nsignal that I was telling you was absent\nwhen you in inappropriately calculated\nthe distance down onto the road all of\nthat is in place and your brain is\nsaying everything's fine but as we're\ndrifting off into sleep we start to lose\nthat proprioceptive feedback now\nnormally that loss of propri acceptive\nfeedback and sensation of what's going\non and where my body is is is is before\nthe loss of consciousness and so you\nlose Consciousness and that's then\nthereafter when the loss of propri\nreception happens and you don't have\nthis sort of you know mental freak out\nof of propri receptive break glass in\ncase of\nemergency but sometimes the speed with\nwhich those things happen changes and\nyou start to lose the propri receptive\nsensation before you fully lose\nConsciousness and at that point your\nbody says oh my goodness mattress has\njust disappeared and I'm falling\ngot and that's where you can have these\nthese jugs that's that's our current\nbest theory I know we're going to talk a\nlot about dreaming in a later episode of\nthe series but uh what you just told me\nforces me to ask at this moment whether\nor not in dreams where we sense we are\nflying is that possible because of the\nabsence of proception we we're sort of\nwe're on the mattress or on whatever\nsurface we sleep on but according to the\nbrain there's uh we're suspended in\nspace is that right yeah so it's it it's\none possibility as to why we have those\nexperiences in some ways though it does\nbring us on to REM sleep during REM\nsleep and I'll explain what happens in\nthe brain but what you're talking about\nis something that is even more unique\nabout REM sleep as we go into REM sleep\nyour brain paralyzes your body so you\nare physically locked into the\nincarceration of your\nbody why why would your brain do this\nit's what we call muscle atoni now I was\ntelling you that we measure your\nelectrical brain activity and we measure\nyour eye movement activity but we also\nmeasure your muscle activity why do we\ndo that well as you're going into\nnon-rem sleep that muscle tone decreases\nbut there's still some muscle tone there\nbut as you go into REM sleep in fact\njust a few seconds before you enter REM\nsleep I already know you're going into\nRAM sleep because bang you you become\ncompletely absent of muscle toone\nand if I were to pick you and I mean I'm\nI'm probably not going to be able to\npick you up out of your bed um based on\ncertain images I've seen on social media\num I'm going to if I lift you up you'd\njust be like a rag doll you'd have no\nmuscle tone whatsoever it's almost like\nthose toys where it's like a donkey that\nsits up and it's got a button underneath\nand you press the button whoosh and it\njust falls down I used to have those as\na kid too like the simple things that\nyou and I had as children that would\nfate still own a couple of these but\nthey but yeah I need to get a donkey one\num in any event um I know what you're\nreferring to so this this muscle and as\nwe call muscle Aton and I think in sort\nof medicine usually with an a before it\nmeans the absence of something so sort\nof if you're if you have arhythmia\nabsence of normal arhythmia aasia yeah\nsort of or um and here it's aonia\nabsence of the tone in your\nmuscles why would the brain do this well\nthe brain paralyzes your body so your\nmind can dream safely you would imagine\nhow quickly you could be popped out of\nthe G pool if just like you described\nyou thought I can fly so you get up out\nof your bed and you go to the window and\nyou launch probably not going to end\nwell depending on what floor you're on\nso this absence of muscle tone this\nphysical incarceration that we have is\none of the things by the the way that\ndefines REM sleep from when you are\nawake because if all I was doing in my\nsleep lab was recording your electrical\nbrain activity and I was in the other\nroom and I was just looking at your your\nbrain waves as you go into REM sleep I\nwould not be able to tell are you in REM\nsleep or are you awake why because the\nelectrical brain activity is so similar\nwhen you are in REM sleep relative to\nwhen you're awake and what that tells us\nis that REM sleep is an incred\nincredibly active cerebral condition\nyour brain is just firing away in fact\nsome parts of your brain can be up to\n30% more active when you're in REM sleep\nthan when you're awake stunning\nparticularly emotional brain centers so\nit's a it's a stunning state of of\nparadox and that's the reason that we\nsometimes call it paradoxical sleep your\nbody is completely\nimmobilized\nutterly inactive but your brain is\nfervent with its activity by the way\npeople should not worry when I say that\nyou are your your muscles are shut down\nand what happens is that as just before\nyou go into REM sleep there's a bursting\nactivity that will go up into your brain\nto light up your cortex but there's\nanother signal from the brain stem\nthat's sent down all the way down the\nspinal cord to the Alpha motor neurons\nin the spinal cord that will essentially\ncreate this inhibition it's only your\nvoluntary sceletal muscles meaning that\nyour involuntary muscles things for\nexample such as your respiration that\nhelps you breathe in your heart that's\nthe reason that we you know survive and\nlive another day after sleep so don't\nworry about that too much with two\nexceptions though there are two sets of\nvoluntary\nmuscles for reasons that we still don't\nknow either that are spurred from the\nparalysis of REM sleep one of them is\nthe extraocular muscles and that's the\nreason that when you go into REM sleep\nyou can have these darting horizontal\nmovements back and forth those should\nalso have been paralyzed but they're not\nand then oddly there is a a muscle in\nthe middle inner ear muscle that does\nnot undergo the paralysis and it will\nalso twitch too just like your eyes but\nI'm getting into the weed so that's\nwhat's happening in these different\nphysiological States and to your\nquestion when you don't have any muscle\ntone whatsoever maybe that is imp part\nthe reason why a you can start to have\nthese dreams of absent gravitational\npull meaning you can start to fly it may\nalso be the reason by the way that\ncoming back to propri reception you can\nsometimes have that feeling of some\npeople will describe my teeth are always\nfalling out I always feel as though it's\na very common thing to to or you feel\nthe absence of clothing on your body and\nyou say I walked out and I was going to\nthis meeting and I realized I didn't\nhave any pants on and and you forget\nthat proception is also about knowing\nthat your clothes are on you and sensing\nthose clothes you and I can now direct\nour attention and sense those clothes on\nus is it also the case that um when we\ntalk about sleep we talk about falling\nasleep that the sense that one is\nfalling back into their head I um is\nrelated to the progressive loss of\npropri reception in the early stages of\nsleep or is it just semantics no I often\nthink that that may have being where it\nthat that notion comes from\nwe why would we not say that I am\nsometimes people say I'm drifting off\ninto sleep but or I'm about to enter\nsleep and we say I'm I'm falling asleep\nnow some of that may be that I'm falling\ninto a sort of a deeper and deeper state\nof a brain wave activity pattern maybe\nbut I actually think you're right now we\ndon't know ultimately the origin of it\nbut I believe it's imp pop because\npeople have this sense of falling hence\nfalling asleep along those lines um I've\nfound that if I sleep horizontally on a\nbed or sofa um the sleep is Far and Away\ndifferent than if I'm fall asleep\nupright in a chair or partially upright\nin a recliner yeah um\nfor instance on an airplane now there\nare a bunch of other things happening on\nairplanes Bright Lights noises Etc um so\nit's not a a good experiment to compare\nthose two situations airplane recliner\nversus uh in bed at night um too many\nvariables temperature especially but um\nis there any evidence that one's bodily\nposition during sleep or the uh\norientation of the feet relative to the\nhead you know the angle elevated upward\nor downward has any impact on the uh\npattern of of different sleep stages or\nuh quality or uh any other aspects of\nsleep there is a reason for it and we'll\nprobably come on to this at some point\nwhen we speak about different methods\nfor Sleep optimization or the new wave\nof of fascinating sleep enhancement\ntools has to do with temperature we\nthink that for you to be able to fall\nasleep and stay asleep you have to drop\nyour brain and body temperature by just\na little less than about 1 degre Celsius\nor probably two two and a half degrees\nFahrenheit and that's the reason by the\nway that you will always find it easier\nto fall asleep in a room that's too cold\nthan too hot because the room that's too\ncold is at least taking you in the right\ntemperature direction for good sleep\nwhereas the room that's too hot the\nopposite it turns out that the body's\nability to dissipate heat what we call\nThermo regulation here and Thermo\nregulation in One Direction which is\nwhich is the reduction in core body\ntemperature is superior when you are\nlying down versus when you are inclined\nversus when you are standing up really\nand in part it has to do with the\ndistribution of blood throughout certain\nparts of the brain in the distal versus\nproximal regions meaning sort of the\nregions that are Clos to the core of\nyour body versus the regions that are\nfurther away but your body's ability if\nwe largely take most item items of\nclothes off you and then we measure the\nthe core body temperature and the way\nthat we do this um it's a delightful\ntechnique it's called a rectal probe and\nit's neither Pleasant necessarily for\nthe installation of the the the the\nexperiment of doing it and it's\ncertainly not necessarily for the\nparticipant but putting that aside for a\nsecond they we can measure your core\nbody temperature and we can measure\nusing temperature sensors all over your\nbody exactly what's going on with the\nblood flow and we can measure how the\nbrain is starting to dis ipate the heat\nbecause one of the principal ways that\nwe dissipate heat from our body is by\nmoving blood around the body when we\nbring blood into the core of our body\nwe're trapping it in the core and our\ncore body temperature increases when we\npush that blood out to the surface it\ngoes to these thin sort of capillaries\nand vessels on the surface of your skin\nand you start to dissipate that heat and\nyou dissipate it more quickly so your\ncore body temperature drops and the\nbody's sort of vasoactive capacity for\nDistributing that blood and then\nreleasing that trapped heat from the\ncore of the body is superior when you\nare lying down and therefore your body\ntemperature can drop more quickly which\nis one of the many reasons why it's not\nas easy to fall asleep when you're sort\nof at a 45° angle and why the quality of\nyour sleep won't be as good now there\nare other reasons to just as you\nmentioned but coming back to\nposition I would say that there are\nmaybe there's perhaps at least two\npieces of evidence that would recommend\npositional differences or positional\nchanges the the first is very obvious if\nyou are someone who is snoring and you\nhave certainly if you have untreated\nsleep apnea which is um where you're\nsort of not just snoring but you'll have\nan absence of breath that's what the\nword apnea means here's another one with\nan a in front of it pinea sort of you\nknow you've heard of pneumonia and it\nthis is about breath and apnea is about\nan absence of that breath and with sleep\napnea not only do you start to have an\nairway collapsing partially and that's\nwhere you get that flutter and that's\nthe sound of the flutter that we're\nhaving but then at some point you just\nhear silence and at that point the\nperson's stop breathing entirely absence\nof breath that is much more likely to\nhappen if you are sleeping on your back\nbecause when you're sleeping on your\nback your Airway is giving way to\ngravity which is wanting to pull the\nairway down and close it and shut it off\nso one of the suggestions for people who\nhave snoring or sleep apne is trying as\nbest you can to train yourself out of\nsleeping on your back now there's lots\nof gadgets out there that can sort of\nhelp and ways can do that the old school\nway that we used to do it um sleep apne\nis more common in men than it is in\nwomen but women still have it but if you\nhad a male you would bring them into the\nthe clinic and you would say could you\nand it's often males who perhaps are\ncarrying excessive body weight and so\nthey're of larger Mass size You' say can\nyou also bring a t-shirt in uh of your\nwife and it has to be a t-shirt that is\nthat has a pocket on the front and then\nwe would ask them to wear the T-shirt\nback to front so it's a very tight\nfitting t-shirt it's back to front and\nthen you took a tennis ball or a hockey\nball in the back pocket and as you're\nlying there in bed and you turn over\nonto your back you get this painful\nsignal of the tennis ball pushing you in\nthe back and it gradually I know who\ncame up with this is this Matt was this\num Matt Walker's idea this is not me I\nam not it's clever yeah I should now be\non social media I should be changed to\nsort of like sleep torturer rather than\nsleep Diplomat um so that's one\nrecommendation try to stay clear if\nyou're asking me are there certain\npositions we should stay away from in\nthat circumstance yes it would be the\nother comes back to something I\nmentioned during deep sleep when this\ncleansing system starts to kick into\ngear in your brain and wash away these\ntoxins from the\nday what we've\nfound a little bit of evidence and we\nand the Royal we because I um like you\nmy lab doesn't do um animal research we\nonly do human research but some animal\nresearchers had discovered that when\nanimals will sleep with their head on\nthe side the the cleansing capacity of\nthe brain is superior than when the\nanimal is sleeping on its back or\nsleeping on its front and in fact if you\nlook and you would love this project if\nyou go on to Google and you just search\nfor sleeping animals look at the head\nposition and I will guarantee you that\nmany of them if they're naturalistic are\nanimals with their head turned to the\nside now the cute ones the funny ones\nare when a you know a kitten is SPL out\non its back and its head is back that's\nhow someone with sleep apne would sort\nof sleep on their back and but that's\nvery rare we almost never see that so\nit's very interesting and what they\nfound was that when those heads were in\nthose sort of side positions the\ncleansing mechanism of the brain was a\nlittle bit better it wasn't night or day\nit's not as though oh my goodness I'm a\nfront sleeper and you know I'm not\ngetting any brain cleansing or I'm a\nback sleeper and not I'm not saying that\nthere's no need to take it to the\nextreme but I I don't think there's any\ngood evidence yet in humans that firstly\nthat's the case and nor is the strong\nenough evidence to make any\nrecommendations but I just bring it up\nbecause it's in the data and it's\nstarting to emerge that if you were to\nask me about sleeping position and are\nthere any recommendations those are the\ntwo pieces of descriptive advice I would\ngive you they are not prescriptive\npieces of advice you mentioned the\nrelationship between temperature and\nsleep and we're going to get into that\nuh in some degree of detail a little bit\nlater because it's so critical but um\nprior to starting to record this episode\nwe were talking a little bit about\nyawning um and you told me something\nreally truly fascinating about yawning\nwhich\nwas so there are at least four competing\ntheories of yawning that we have and I\nthink there is probably a emerging clear\nwinner um the first theory was that it\nwas just tiredness that yawning is\nsimply a sign of you being tired and it\nturns out that that's not true because\nmany people can yawn when they're\nbored and they are not tired and they've\nbeen very well rested so that doesn't\nseem to be true the next one was one\nthat that seems to be very logical which\nis it's about trying to rebalance your\nblood gases and specifically oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide and you would think that\nperhaps when you yawn with that sort of\nwhen you and you inhale a huge volume of\noxygen what you're trying to do is pump\nback up the oxygen in your bloodstream\nor when you sort\nof and the exhale maybe it's about\nexhaling more carbon dioxide not unlike\nthe physiological size that occur during\nsleep of a double inhale with a long\nexhale correct or that one can\nvoluntarily generate for anxiety\nManagement in wakeful St exactly Y and\nso that was a a theory that maybe you're\ntrying to balance these these blood\ngases and there was some very clever\nexperiments where they took it\nindividuals and they artificially\nincreased their oxygen uh levels but\nmore specifically they increased their\ncarbon dioxide levels by directionally\nthey tried to manipulate it and they\nasked did those individuals start to\nyawn more because the idea would be if\nyour blood oxygen is coming down and\nyour carbon dioxide is starting to rise\nif this theory is correct you should\nstart yawning with greater frequency and\nthere was no difference whatsoever\nthat's probably also the reason that you\ndon't see people yawning on a treadmill\nor when they're going into more of an\noxygen debt and higher levels of carbon\ndioxide so that theory was knocked out\nthe third theory was one of\ncontagion and it's fascinating yawning\nlike several other things has a\ncontagious element to it so as the\naudience unexpectedly they didn't know\nwhat you were going to say and before\nyou said it you said you told us\nsomething interesting\nabout and you did I guarantee you that\nthere will be people listening right now\nwho said oh I just yawned in response to\nAndrew hubman yawning it is very\ncontagious in part it's the mirror\nneuron system and you've obviously\nunderstand this in depth your brain has\nthis capacity to mirror the action\nstates of other individuals so a good\nexample would be let's say I'm walking\nout the door now I'm closing the door\nwith my hand and all of a sudden I'm\ngoing to get my hand trapped and you on\nthe other side of the room you are\nseeing my hand and as soon as I trap my\nhand and I Yelp out in pain you almost\nhold your own hand oh because why why\nwhy are you doing that it's not just\nbecause you know you're trying to be you\nknow compassionate no you have\nexperienced some degree of what I've\njust experienced how does it do that\nbecause your brain has a system inside\nof it that mirrors my action States and\nit's called a mirror system and you can\nimagine why it's very good to understand\nthe action and emotional states of\nothers for pro-social capacities and all\nof that good stuff and one of the things\nthat can also happen with this mirror\nneuron system is that it mimics yawning\nso when you yawn my likelihood of\nyawning increases too because my mirror\nneuron system is matching your Y and\nwhat's interesting is that we know other\nspecies also have a mirror neuron system\nand that means that when you ywn there\nis a statistically higher chance that\nyour dog will yawn and it's cross\nspecies so when your dog\nyawns there's a higher probability that\nyou will yawn and we've got this St and\nit's it's very clear one of the other\ninteresting theories though is that when\num species that are Cooperative species\nfor example a pride of life\nLions when one of those Lions yawns\nfirstly many of the other Lions will\nyawn in a contagious fashion but then\nconsequently there is a collection of\nactions that happen after that\ncontagious yawn and so some people have\nsuggested that the yawning is a way to\nenact Cooperative group Behavior that's\nanother theory the final Theory number\nfour which I think has the best evidence\nfor is not the gaseous exchange\nbalancing of carbon dioxide and oxygen\nbut when you inhale oxygen from the\noutside it's usually cooler than your\ncore body and brain\ntemperature and when we inhale there is\na modest drop in brain temperature and\nwhen the brain temperature starts to\nrise that's when we see yawning\nfrequency beginning to increase so next\ntime you see someone yawn don't think oh\nthey're bored or they didn't get enough\nsleep go over to them hug them and say I\nknow your brain is getting warm it's\nokay and then at that point the\nfriendship will be terminated because no\none should be hooking each other and\nsaying your brain is warm I'm so sorry\nbut anyway that aside um I'm sorry we I\ntook us down that that um tributary of\nmy polluted stream of Consciousness but\nthat's yawning explained those are the\nfour theories and we don't have a\ndefinitive answer but I think the best\none right now that will continue is that\nit's about brain cooling that theory\nmakes a lot of sense um people tend to\nyawn when they get tired as you\nmentioned people can yawn for other\nreasons as\nwell if I'm yawning because I'm tired\nand yawning is to cool off my brain\nthat's too warm is that an attempt to\nput my brain to sleep because we need to\ncool the brain in order for it to go to\nsleep or something else going on there\nalso and this um sort of merges with the\nprevious question about body position\nI've lectured in the university for you\nknow well over a decade as I know you\nhave as well and occasionally every once\nin a while there's one student I'm just\nkidding there are several students\nespecially if it's an afternoon\nclass or a very early morning class that\nis falling asleep in their chair and\nthen their head they kind of jolt awake\nand we all know that keeping the room a\nlittle bit cooler sometimes helps to\nkeep people awake\num as opposed to a warm afternoon\nclassroom but in some ways what we're\ntalking about here um violates what you\nwere talking about earlier that it's\neasier to fall asleep in a cool\nenvironment as opposed to a warm\nenvironment uh the brain needs to cool\nin order to fall asleep but then when we\nyawn it's in response to the brain being\ntoo warm and so um and so I'm I'm having\na little bit Circle for me yeah help me\nunderstand square square that Circle I\nlike it yeah please square that Circle\nfor me Matt um it turns out that for you\nto drop your core body temperature the\nopposite has to happen which is that you\nhave to warm up to cool down to fall\nasleep and I mean warm up in a very\nspecific way you have to have the outer\nsurface of your brain warm up you have\nto get blood to the surface of your skin\nand that surface it almost acts like a\nsnake charmer that it Dr draws the warm\nblood from the core and it pushes it to\nthe surface and you radiate the heat out\nand as you radiate the heat out said\nyour core body temperature plummets so\nwhy would people be falling asleep sort\nof you know in an afternoon meeting when\nit starts to get a little warm well in\npart it's because the warmth of the room\nis starting to make the sort of face a\nlittle bit more Rosy it's drawing the\nblood out to the surface so what's\nhappening the core of your brain and\nyour body temperature are starting to\ndrop and at that point that's why you're\ngoing to start to feel a little bit more\nsleepy that's reason one the second that\nyou described is that afternoon you know\nyou're in meetings around a table and\nyou start to get as you said those\nwonderful head nuts and people listening\nyou you all know that where the of head\ngoes down and snaps back up it's not\nthat people are listening to good music\nand sort of doing this head bobbing it's\nthat they falling prey to what we know\nis a genetically hardwired\npre-programmed drop in your afternoon\nalertness it's called the postprandial\ndip in alertness and that infers that\nit's after some kind of a a meal it\nturns out it's not really related to a\nmeal people say well I had a heavy lunch\nI had sort of pastor at lunch and I\nalways feel sleepy afterwards maybe in\npart but if I remove I prevent you from\nhaving lunch and we've done these\nstudies too your brain still shows this\nvery reliable drop and alertness\nsomewhere between quite wide but\nsomewhere between about 1: to 4:00 p.m.\nin the afternoon yeah for me it's always\nbetween 2: and 300 p.m. which uh is a\ntime I'm resisting looking at my watch\nright now just to see yeah we might be\nin that in that uh phase of the day uh I\ncan always feel it and um if I close my\neyes for 10 20 minutes um it I usually\ncan fall asleep pretty quickly yeah for\na nap I know we'll talk about naps later\num but if I don't and I ride it out I\nthen you know usually by about 3 3:30\nI'm fine get that rise back up don't you\nand it sort of swings back up and so\nthat's in part the reason though\nexplaining the yawning and that that\nwarm feeling of I'm in the the meeting\nroom the boardroom meeting and the the\nthe blinds are open the sun is coming\nthrough I've got the sun on my back I'm\nstarting to get very warm but I'm\nstarting to get really really sleepy\nit's\nthe it's the collusion of two things\nit's that you're going into this higher\nfrequency sleep Zone in the afternoon\nthis postprandial drop in your brain\nalertness and we can measure it it's\nvery reliable you can see this dip in\nyour brain electrical activity and\nyou're getting warm at the surface which\nbrings blood to the surface releases\nthat heat from the core it drops and boy\ndo you want to fall asleep I want to\ntake a brief break and acknowledge our\nsponsor inside tracker inside tracker is\na personalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data

I took us on a bit of a journey\ninto some um I don't want to call them\nsidebars but some uh specific features\naround sleep and falling asleep\nEtc let's get back to the different\nstages of sleep and frame that under the\nquestion of what is great sleep what is\nmediocre sleep I think we all know what\nbad sleep is it's when you can't get\nsleep but I think there's a whole\ndifferent category of bad sleep that\nyou're going to tell us about which is\nsleep that we think is good but is\nactually not as good as we we think it\nis I'm always the barer of Doom and\nGloom no well and but also but also the\num the deliver of of powerful tools to\nimprove one's one's sleep and thereby\nwakeful state so along those lines you\nknow what is sleep for truly and what\nhappens when we don't sleep well is\nperhaps more intuitive to most people\nyou know oh I feel cranky or I can't\nremember things or I just kind of you\nknow um stress seems to feel a little\nmore intense the same amount of stress\nfeels more intense um and what is great\nsleep you know and and and this is I\nthink all under the umbrella of of you\nknow why do we sleep I mean why do we\nspend a good third to you know or more\nof our life in in this incredible state\nof mind and body that we call sleep and\nit really is quite a\nstunning state of\nidiocy when when you consider it because\nwhen you're asleep you're not finding a\nmate you're not reproducing you're not\nforaging for food you're not caring for\nyour young and worse still you are\nvulnerable to\npredation on any one of those grounds\nbut especially all of them as a\ncollective sleep should have been\nstrongly selected against in the course\nof evolution and in fact one of the\nfounding fathers of sleep research Alan\nre shaen once said that if sleep doesn't\nserve an absolutely vital function it is\nthe biggest mistake The evolutionary\nprocess has ever made and now what we've\nlearned\nthrough you know almost 10,000 plus\nresearch studies over the past certainly\n70 80 years now is that nature did not\nmake a spectacular blunder in creating\nthis thing called sleep so maybe I can\nfirstly address what is what is sleep\ndoing and what happens if we're not\ngetting sufficient sleep and then the\nother question is what is what is good\nsleep in terms of what sleep is doing\nand why he was right in saying that\nmother nature didn't make a a blunder\nand it hasn't by the way because if you\ngo back every species that we have\ncarefully studied to date seems to sleep\nand what that tells us even you know\nvery old evolutionary old ancient um\nearthworms seem to sleep they will have\na period of what we call theargus which\nis they seem to be\ninactive so what I I bring that point up\nbecause it means that sleep appears to\nhave evolved with life itself on this\nplanet and then it has fought its way\nthrough heroically every step along the\nevolutionary path and that by itself\nmust tell us that whatever sleep is\ndoing it must be\nnon-negotiable life support\nnecessary in what ways is it life\nsupport necessary well we now know many\nof those first when you're not getting\nsufficient sleep I can speak about your\nhormonal\nsystems let's say I take a group of\nreally healthy young men and I limit\nthem to four or five hours of sleep for\nfive nights they will have a level of\ntestosterone which is similar to someone\nwho is probably 10 years older than them\nso a lack of sleep will agid you within\n5 days by a decade we also see\nequivalent imp uh imper in female\nreproductive Health caused by a lack of\nsleep impermanence in estrogen in\nfollicle stimulating hormone and also in\nlutenizing hormone what what about the\nuh effects of a single night's poor\nsleep on on hormones um and not to get\ntoo down in the details here but uh is\nit necessary to have four or five nights\nof minimal sleep in a row before you\nstart to see these effects or let's say\nsomebody's getting good sleep for three\nnights or four nights of the week but\nthen the other three are kind of\nchallenging for whatever reason does one\nsee a graded effect a kind of\nintermediate reduction in sex steroid\nhormones like testosterone estrogen\nfollicle stimulation there is some\ndegree of a dose response curve but we\nhaven't mapped it out with high so the\nway I would want to do it as a sleep\nscientist would say okay I'm going to do\nthis for one night and I'm going to thin\nslice you to seven hours 6 hours 5 hours\nand then I'm going to do it for two\nnights and you're going to again be in\nthe 6 hours 7 hours 4 hours and I would\nlike to build up this High Fidelity map\nand understand that we don't have that\nbut certainly what we know is that a\nnight of total deprivation will markedly\nimper those hormones and we know that\nafter about you know a working week of\nshort sleep you see those imp perance\ntoo um but let me come back to one night\nso that's the hormonal system as an\nexample and we've already spoken or I'll\ncome back to it um right now the\nmetabolic system and another hormone um\ninsulin what we found is that if I take\nyou again and I limit your and you're\nperfectly normal healthy you don't have\nany signs of type 2 diabetes and I limit\nyou to let's say 5 hours of sleep for\nfour nights and then I measure your\nability to dispose of blood sugar and um\nyour level of blood sugar impairment is\nso disrupted that at that point your\ndoctor would classifier as being\npre-diabetic so I could take an\nindividual and within five nights of\nshort sleep I can move them towards a\npath that's getting very close to type 2\ndiabetes and as I said we've UND and we\nRoyal we here um whenever I say we by\nthe way it usually means that um well\nwhenever I say I did something I mean at\nmy Center we did something and when I\nsay we did something I mean that they\ndid\nsomething that's a a fair Shand for uh\nfor attribution um and so so there there\nhave been studies that have really\ndecomposed exactly how that impermanent\nin blood sugar happens and we mentioned\nthat earlier in this episode I can also\nthen move on to for example your um your\nimmune system this is a very good\ndemonstration firstly there's a great\nstudy done by Michael ow and his\ncolleagues at UCLA and he took\nindividuals healthy individuals and he\nlimited them to just four hours of sleep\nfor one single\nnight and he measured levels of critical\nanti-cancer fighting immune cells called\nnatural killer cells and what he found\nis that after that one night of Just 4\nhours of sleep there was a 70% reduction\nin natural killer cell activity that is\na striking state of immune deficiency\nand just to give people a you know a\nreference point these natural killer\ncells were think of them almost like the\nsecret service agent of your immune\nsystem these natural killer cells they\nare very good at identifying dangerous\nunwanted elements in your body like\ncancer and going after them and\ndestroying them so you wish for a very\nverile set of these immune assassins in\nyour body at all times and if you're not\ngetting sufficient sleep that may not\nnecessarily be the case we also know\nthat if you are not getting sufficient\nsleep in the week before you get your\nflu shot and this is just another\nexample of how sleep is critical for\nyour immune system if you're not getting\nthat sleep in the week before you get\nyour flu shot you produce less than 50%\nof the normal antibody response\ntherefore rendering that flu shot\nlargely ineffective in terms of\nvaccinating you we also know that if\nyou're not getting sufficient sleep on\naverage let's say that you're getting\nless than 6 hours of sleep or less on\naverage you're almost three times more\nlikely to develop the common cold common\nflu and I know that you at the time of\nus recording this um you've released\nsome fantastic content about the the flu\nand and the Rhino virus in particular so\nthat's a good demonstration of your\nimmune system we also know that it's not\njust that it's also your cardiovascular\nsystem that suffers when you're not\ngetting sufficient sleep and here again\nthe data I think is very strong\ncardiovascular disease RIT large\nincluding stroke and and heart attack\nand there is one study that I think\nillustrates this and and granted now in\nterms of the replication the effect\nsizes may not be as big but the study\nwas\ninteresting they didn't do something\nradical like depriving you of sleep for\nan entire night nor did they just limit\nyou to 5 hours of sleep for you know\nfour nights there is a global experiment\nsleep experiment that has performed on\nabout\n1.65 billion people across 70 countries\ntwice a year and it's called daylight\nsavings time now in the spring when we\nlose an hour of sleep what they observed\nin that paper was a 24% relative\nincrease in heart attack risk the\nfollowing day yet in the autumn in the\nfall when you gain an hour of sleep\nthere was a 21% reduction amazing in\nheart so it's bidirectional and by the\nway and I I said that that paper there\nare you can there are some aspects that\nyou can sort of discuss but it has been\nreplicated we see increased rates of\nhospitalization after that 1 hour of\nlost sleep in the spring there are\nhigher rates of car accidents on the\nroad after 1 hour of lost sleep we also\nsee higher rates of suicide after 1 hour\nof lost sleep during the spring time\nchange we even see this is great data\nthey they looked at um the sentencing of\nfederal judges in the United States and\nbecause it's the federal system the\ngovernment system all of those things\nare cataloged and well documented you\nhave a huge database and they went back\nand what they found is that in the\nspring when we all lose that 1 hour of\nsleep\nopportunity those judges doled out\nharsher Federal sentencing in the day\nafter they had lost one hour of sleep\nbecause their emotional and mood states\nwere imper and we'll speak about this in\na later episode too so if you are up for\nsentencing or please try to avoid that\nspring time change as best you can go\nfor the go for the fall date if if it's\npossible um so that's that's your\ncardiovascular system I could also tell\nyou that it goes all the way down into\nthe cellular and molecular state of your\nbody and this I'm trying to do this to\nimpress the fundamental importance of\nsleep there was a wonderful study done\nby my colleagues at the University of\nSur back in the UK by led by duk Yandy\nand what they demonstrated was that if\nyou take healthy individuals\nand everyone is going to act as their\nown control and you limit them to um 6\nhours of sleep for one week versus\nallowing them to sleep at least 8 and 1\nhalf hours or more time in bed and then\nwhat they did was they measured the\nchange in their gene activity\nprofile relative to when those same\nindividuals as I said were getting a\nfull 8 hour plus opportunity in bed\nversus the 6 hours of limited sleep and\nthey found two interesting things first\na sizable and significant\n711 genes were distorted in their\nactivity caused by a lack of sleep by\nthe way that's relevant we know that\nalmost one out of every three maybe even\none out of every two if you look at the\ndata people that pass you on the street\nis trying to survive on six hours of\nsleep or less during the week so it's a\nrelevant ecological\nmanipulation the second result was that\nabout half of those genes were increased\nin their activity the other half would\ndecreased now those genes that were imp\npurred by way of one week of short sleep\nwere genes associated with the immune\nsystem so once again you can see this\nimmune deficiency but now playing out at\na genetic level those genes that were\nincreased or what we call overexpressed\nwere genes that were associated with the\npromotion of tumors genes that were\nassociated with long-term chronic\ninflammation within the body and genes\nthat were associated with cellular\nstress and as a consequence\ncardiovascular\ndisease and to me that study impressed\nthe fact that there is no aspect of your\nWellness that seems to be able to\nretreat at the sign of sleep deprivation\nand get away unscathed it's almost like\na broken water pipe in your home that\nsleep will leak down into every knck and\ncranny of your physiology and it will\neven tamper with the very DNA nucleic\nalphabet that spells out your daily\nHealth\nnarrative so I I paint this this picture\nwhich seems dire and it I think someone\nonce said to me look your your Ted Talk\nwhich I think it was called Sleep uh\nsleep is your superpower they said that\ntalk should have actually been sleep or\nelse dot dot dot which was a completely\nfair thing because I think you know very\nearly on as a public figure for sleeper\num I did a terrible job I was very\ndictator I was very disagree um well I\nwas I think I think I was very\nabsolutist and I've I've learned my\nlesson I'm I disagree and and um and I'm\ngoing to interrupt intentionally uh not\nto to Puff you up just because but I I\nthink that it's fair to say I know it's\nfair to say that the cautionary notes\nthat you spoke about in those early TED\ntalks and in your book why we sleep um\nwhile they may have stimulated some\nanxiety for some people uh they\nabsolutely\nhad and have a net positive effect in\nthe sense that they cued people to the\nimportance of this thing called sleep\nbecause prior to you doing that or those\nthings it was the case that it was the\nI'll sleep when I'm dead mentality um\nand as somebody who's pulled many\nallnighters in his career many many um\nalthough not these days any longer thank\ngoodness um I can tell you that that\ninformation was transformative for for\nmy behavior and also for people in the\nArenas of military Sports children\nadults I I it is fair to say that we\nhave better parents better kids better\ncitizens of every country as a\nconsequence so I I uh won't allow you\none of the few things I'll I you will\nhave a hard line on I won't allow you to\nU malign your contribution um and the\ngood news is this series is also going\nto include a lot of discussion about\nthings that one can do anyone can do to\nimprove their sleep so yeah and so\nenough with that for saying that I will\nI will stop trying to reject that um but\nI would also folks put in the comments\non YouTube whether or not you agree with\nme or you agree with Matt and then um\nyou know uh and thanks for agreeing with\nme um I would say though that please\ndon't start as you mentioned there\nyou're getting anxious if you're not\nfinding it easy to fall asleep that\nlisten\nto me is firstly probably not going to\nmake matters any better but don't think\neven if you're in the general public\nthat look I had one bad night of sleep\ndoes it mean I'm now going to develop\nAlzheimer's disease absolutely not\nthere's we're not suggesting that we're\ntalking about a model in which you know\nweek after week month after month yes\nI've demonstrated that you know after\njust one night of something of short\nsleep you can see measurable impairments\nand we can and I can't you know I can't\nbe untruthful about the scientific data\nbut it's not as catastrophic as one may\nthink and as you said in this series we\nwill also speak and focus a great deal\nabout what can you do to start to try to\noptimize your sleep so thank you for\nthat opportunity absolutely so lots of\nthings not good for us happen when we\ndon't sleep enough on a consistent basis\nyes one poor night's sleep let's face it\nI mean our species would cease to exist\nif if that were the case because all\nthese parents that have stayed up where\nyou have a you know an emergency or that\nthe neighbor's dog is barking or you you\ngo to an airb B where it's too warm and\nand you can't sleep I mean um but\nclearly bad things start to happen when\nwe are chronically sleep\ndeprived we hear less often about the\ngreat things that happen when we get\ngreat sleep um perhaps we can talk about\na few of those I mean obviously um many\nof them are going to be the inverse of\nwhat you just described but uh for\ninstance learning neuroplasticity the\nnervous system's ability to change in\nresponse to experience uh sleep\ndeprivation impairs learning yes yeah um\nand a great night's sleep makes it a lot\neasier to learn right so what are the\ndata in terms of the relationship\nbetween sleep and learning again\nsomething we're going to go into in\nquite a bit more detail but can you give\nus a um uh can you can you throw us a\nbone about some of the can you\nincentivize us for getting good sleep\nnot just through fear but we heard the\nsticks um you know throw us a carrot\nyeah so there are so many wonderful\ncarrots so when you are sleeping your\nbrain's capacity and its Learning\nCenters are so much more ready to absorb\ninformation so think about these memory\ncenters in the brain almost like a dry\nsponge if you've been sleeping well and\nthey are so excited to soak up new\ninformation and retain that information\nso firstly sleep before learning is\ngoing to help you acquire and imprint\nnew memories very effectively and we've\ndemonstrated that we I'll tell you about\nthe studies in in a later episode we\nalso know though sleep after learning\ndoes something delicious it will take\nthose freshly minted memories and it\nwill consolidate them into the brain\nmeaning that it will start to fixate\nthem almost like sort of setting them in\nconcrete into the brain and so you are\nfar less likely to lose those memories\nwhich is to say you are far less likely\nto forget if you've been sleeping after\nyou've\nlearned it's not just that though sleep\ndoes more than simply strengthen those\nindividual memories sleep will start to\nCrosslink and connect those memories\ntogether and as a Consequence the next\nday you will wake up and those that\nmemory back catalog has now been updated\nwith all of the recent information and\nit's integrated and it's Associated so\nyou are now able to come up with new\nCreative\nSolutions to issues or problems that\nyou've been facing because you've\nupdated what we call the associative\nnetworks in your\nbrain and this is the reason that people\nwill describe having had these insights\nby way of sleep and these problem\nsolving capacities and really that's\nwhat to\nme a good student is not simply a\nstudent who can learn all of the\nindividual wrote facts and then just\nregurgitate them an\nindividual memory is not as sitting as\nan isolate island is not particularly\nuseful that's why your laptop isn't well\nas long as it's not connected to the\ninternet and and uh open AI it's not\nparticularly\nintelligent I mean it has a storage\ncapacity that is almost more perfect\nthan your brain it doesn't make some of\nthe the memory sort of mistakes that we\ndo the reason it's not as intelligent as\nwe are in part is because it has not\nintegrated the information it doesn't\nlink all of the wouldn't it be wonderful\nif you woke up one day and you'd\ninstalled a program on your computer and\nyour computer just understood how all of\nthe files were interrelated and\nconnected and it was saying okay you you\nknow you've double clicked on this file\nwell now I'm going to tell you that\nthere is this related information you\nshould pull this in here and it would\nenhance this paragraph that you're\nworking on or it would improve this\nexperimental idea that you're coming it\ndoesn't do that but your brain does that\nhow does it do that in part it's because\nsleep is building these associative\nnetworks so it's not it's not simply the\nstudent who learns the rote facts it's\nthe student who learns the facts and\nthen understands what they\nmean sleep is not just about learning\nand it's not just about knowledge it's\nabout wisdom which is knowing what it\nall means when you fit it together and\nthat's one of the other roles of sleep\nso those are some of the beneficial\nthings the sort of the the carrots that\ncan come by way of for your learning and\nmemory there are so many other carrots\nthough we described for your immune\nsystem how there is this restoration\nthat happens during deep sleep and it\nprimes that but there are other benefits\ntoo one of the things that we've\ndiscovered and we hopefully we'll get to\ndiscuss this in more detail is that\nsleep\nprovides almost a rebooting of your\nemotional and your mood\nStates and as a consequence you wake up\nthe next day and you are dressed with a\nvery different set of emotional\nclothing and sleep when you're getting\nit almost it's like a set of emotional\nwindscream wipers that it's just cleared\nthose things off and you wake up it's\nthe reason that people will tell you you\nknow\nyou if something is troubling you don't\nworry just come back tomorrow just give\nit a night of sleep and you'll probably\nfeel better tomorrow that feeling better\nnotion is sleep acting as this emotional\nbomb that just soothes that those Jagged\nedges that we've you know be sort of\nalmost like a CD getting scratched if\nanyone out there knows all a CD is these\ndays but you know these scratches that\nwe get emotional wounds sleep is\nstarting to heal those as well so those\nare benefits I could also mention some\nother aspects of your weight control and\nyour weight gain and this is a huge huge\neffect size Sleep moves the needle on\nalmost every aspect of brain and body\nhealth I think it's very clear at this\nstage that there is no single tissue or\nmajor physiological system in your body\nand no operation of your mind that isn't\nwonderfully enhanced by sleep when you\nget it or demonstrably imper when you\ndon't get enough but when it comes to\nappetite and regulation of weight gain\nthis is immense firstly what we know is\nthat when you're getting sufficient\nsleep you can create a a nice\num concentration ratio of two appetite\nregulating hormones called leptin and\ngrin and let me go sort of in the\nreverse to probably give you a better\nexample let me say I deprive you of\nsleep and what we see is that these two\nhormones that and I joke you know that\nsometimes sound like um leptin and grin\nsound like Hobbits from Lord of the\nRings but they're not they're real\nhormones and leptin essentially is the\nsignal that tells your brain okay your\nyou're satiated by your food you're full\nand you don't want to eat more so hunger\nand appetite decrease grin does the\nopposite when grin increases now it's\nthe signal of hunger and you get\nincreasingly unsatisfied despite eating\na f full meal if you've got still high\nlevels of grin you don't feel satisfied\nwith that meal and many people listening\nmay start to say I have this feeling\nwhere I'm just eating and I just don't\nfeel satisfied on some days and those\ndays\nI suspect can be days when you are not\nsleeping well and I think everyone has\nhad this feeling of saying I just didn't\nsleep well last night and I I just get\nravenous and my I just unleash this\nUnholy hunger and an appetite that's in\npart because these two hormones so what\nhappens is that when we're not getting\nsufficient sleep leptin the signal that\nsays you're satisfied with food stop\neating that is imper by way of a lack of\nsleep if that wasn't bad enough the\nhormone grin that says no you're not\nsatisfied with your food eat more that's\nthe signal of hunger that increases so\nit's almost like double jeopardy you're\ngetting punished twice for the same\ncrime of not sleeping once by way of a\ndrop in leptin stop eating and once by\nway of growling foot to the floor\nacceleration I want to start eating\nthat's in part why you're going to your\nwaistline can start to expand when\nyou're not getting sufficient sleep but\nwhen you do it's a it's a fantastic way\nof controlling I guarantee you if you\nstart to implement better sleep your\nability to regulate your basil levels of\nappetite and hunger will\ndecline but it's not just that you want\nto eat less or you at least want to eat\nan appropriate amount for your body mass\nit's also what you want to eat and what\nwe've discovered is that when you are\nagain not getting sufficient sleep you\nstart to eat more more yes you do but\nyou eat more of specific things you\ncrave things like these heavy hitting\nsort of stodgy carbohydrates like bread\nand pasta and potatoes and pizza and\nalso you crave simple\nsugars and so those Foods we know in\nexcess can be what we call obesogenic\nFoods they are foods that can lead you\nto a more rapid amount of weight gain\nwhereas when you are getting sufficient\nsleep now you're reaching at the food\nbar for you're saying what I think the\nthe salad and those healthy nuts and the\nfruits and those things look quite\nappetizing today versus when you are\nunderslept all you want to do is go\nafter the junk food and because you kind\nof got these Munchies what's interesting\nis that a recent discovery came back to\nthat notion of the munchies when I say I\ngot the munchies people sometimes think\nof a drug reference they'll say well\nbeen smoking weed I always get the\nmunchies why is that because when you\nwhen you are bringing in cannabis into\nthe body and these canabo these what we\ncall exogenous canabo they will increase\nyour appetite they will stimulate your\nappetite cannabinoids are appetite\nstimulating components but we all have\nour own version of cannaboids that we\nproduce inside of our body that you've\nspoken about before called endoc canabo\nwhen you are underslept the brain\nreleases more endoc canabo and that's in\npart why you get this strong impulse for\nand thus IO when you start sleeping\nbetter you moderate all of these\nhormones and these chemicals and your\nappetite is controlled when you eat you\nfeel satisfied with your food you're not\ncraving more when you make your food\nchoices you're making better food\nchoices we did a study with brain\nImaging where we underslept individuals\nand we had them see food items inside of\na brain scanner and they had to rate you\nknow how much do I desire and how much\ndo I want these items and those items\nrange from very healthy items all the\nway to unhealthy items things like ice\ncream and sort of pizza and all of that\ngood stuff and sweets um Candy as you\nwould say over here and we looked at\ntheir ratings and by the way we to make\nthis a more ecological because you could\nsay Well they're going to know what's\nthe healthy choice so they're probably\njust is going to be you know politically\ncorrect and say oh I desire the healthy\nfood because the way that we tried to\nget around that was we said anything\nthat you said was desirable when you\ncome outside the scanner we've actually\ngot all of these foods and you're going\nto have to eat them um so they were\nmaking more real realistics and each\nperson went through the experiment twice\none night after full nights of sleep one\nnight with significantly less sleep and\nsure enough inside of the scanner they\nwere rating unhealthier Foods as more\ndesirable so your preference was going\nin that unhealthy Direction but what was\ninteresting was what was going on in the\nbrain we saw that the frontal lobe\nregions these sort of areas that sit\nabove our eyes that almost act like the\nCOO of the brain and they help regulate\nour deep emotional centers those regions\nof the brain had gone offline by way of\na lack of sleep and these emotional\ncenters that are usually associated with\nmore honic reward and they're also\nexcessively more active in people with\nobesity who have what we call honic\neating patterns those regions were\nramped up by way of a lack of sleep so\nit's not just that there are chemical\nchanges in your body that conspire to\nhave you eat more there are also changes\nin your brain that prevent you from\nmaking the healthy food choices but when\nyou're getting sufficient sleep in the\ncontrol condition when they were getting\nthat sleep their brain was beautifully\nregulating the optimal food choices so\nthat that's just another example of a\ncar carrot no pun intended now um that\nwhen you're getting sleep if one of the\nways you want to manage\nyour your body composition and manage\nyour appetite is by way of getting\nsufficient sleep it's actually a very\npowerful tool that we probably underrate\nand then this other aspect I would say\nis emotional and mental Wellness\neveryone knows that your emotional and\nmood States will take a nose dive like a\nDart into the ground when you're not\ngetting sufficient sleep it's that idea\nof I just snapped dot dot dot and those\nare the words that usually you know are\nuttered by people who are not usually\nsleeping very well but when you're\ngetting good sleep it's so much easier\nto regulate and manage those emotions\nand Michael Grand know great sleep\nresearch he did an interesting study and\nit was one of those studies many studies\nI read from my colleagues that my\ninitial reaction to the study was\njealousy because it was such a good\nstudy and I was jealous that I didn't\nthink of the idea and now gradually with\nmy senior age I've disabused myself of\nthat ego and very quickly I then think\nthis is the best faor and I can't wait\nto tweet it out but he did a great study\nand it was only quite recently he asked\nwhat are the reasons that people want to\ntry to improve sleep you would have\nthought that we'd have known this you\nknow decades ago and it's a relevant\nquestion to the point that you're asking\nwhich is about these\ncarrots I know that there is still\nprobably some degree of a sleep loss\nepidemic out there in the world there is\nstill that sleep machismo mentality that\nI can sleep when I'm dead so how can we\ntry to motivate people well I can do it\nwith the stick and I can do the whole\nsort of you know if it bleeds it leads\nand do the Doomsday stuff and that can\nthat can motivate but why don't I try to\nunderstand what it would be for most\npeople that would have them try to enact\nbetter sleep behaviors\nand they asked all sorts of different\noptions and the two things at the end of\nthe paper when they did all the\nstatistics that stood out like two sore\nthumbs I want to try to improve my sleep\nbecause I want to improve my mood I want\nto improve my sleep because I want to\nimprove my body weight people know it\nthey already knew it we didn't have to\nshow them the data and so it's just\ninteresting so I'm just bringing those\ntwo things up as a as carrot examples\nthere are many others of course too\nterrific examples of carrots for uh that\none can get if they get adequate sleep\nand we'll talk about quality and some\nother features of sleep that are\nimportant in just a moment but I'm\ncurious how come when we are sleep\ndeprived um we get bags under our eyes\nand our skin Health shows it like even\none day you know if you know someone\nwell and you see them regularly and they\nwalk in and they they look particularly\nwell rested yeah we you know we think\nthey're you know kind of bright-eyed and\nbushy tailed um so to speak um but you\ncan often see it in their skin and in\ntheir eyes how glassy their eyes are how\nopen their eyes are but also the bags\nunder under their eyes and of course\nfolks um never say to somebody um you\nlook tired um it's it's a the other way\nto um do it is just if if they look\nparticularly well rested on a given day\nsay you look well rested actually I told\nyou that today you did that's right I\nwould have forgot about that but now I\nremember um and and it's true you look\nvery well rested being the the Sleep guy\nand all um why do why do we show our\nlack of sleep in our skin so rapidly\nit's almost like a a thermometer on on\nhow much sleep somebody got the night\nbefore it it's stunning isn't it and you\ncan almost see it you know if if you\nhave a partner and they come through to\nthe sort of kitchen in the morning and\nthey look at you and because you're so\nfamiliar with that face because it's a\nface that has imprinted on you thousands\nof times you can notice subtle changes\nand you can sometimes sense you know\nthey they do look tired but you're\nabsolutely right you don't you don't say\nthat you just say oh you know how are\nyou this morning and is there anything I\ncan do for you should I make you a\ncoffee maybe you should go back to sleep\nand yeah yeah I think that's the that's\nthe politically incorrect indirect way\nof saying boy do you look tired um two\nthings on that that front the first it\ncomes back to the immune system that\nthat sort of pale paror in a face almost\nthat sickly looking skin in PO is\nbecause you're already seeing the\neffects of the immune system and it's\nthe same with the bags under the eyes\nthat part of this reboot of the human\nbeing you know that human beings seem to\nhave what I would describe as a recycle\nrate and it seems to be about 16 hours\nthat after about 16 hours of wakefulness\nwe need about an 8 hourish and it's 7 to\nn hours is the recommendation don't get\nhung up on we'll speak about exactly\nthat in a second but it's that seems to\nbe required to reset this whole panoply\nof of health and physiology of a of a\nhuman being one of the things is the\nimmune system and you get this sickly\nlook about individuals and you get the\nbags under the eyes so that in in part\nexplains it there was a great study done\nby um a colleague of mine Tina sundelin\nand um working out uh in Sweden uh at\nthe kolinska and this again was one of\nthose studies that I just thought was so\ngenius and it was a two-part study they\nfirstly took individuals and they sleep\ndeprived them for a night or they\nallowed them to sleep well in fact they\nwent through both of those and after a\nfull night of sleep or after a night of\nsleep deprivation they went into a\nstudio and they had the picture taken\nthey had a portrait shop done under\nidentical lighting conditions so now for\nevery participant in the study you've\ngot two head shots one of when they were\nsleep deprived one when they were sleep\nrested great now came the second part of\nthe experiment they then took all of\nthose kind of head shots and they\nrecruited a new set of participants who\nacted as an independent set of judges\nand those judges knew nothing about the\nexperimental conditions and the\nmanipulations that had just happened\nthey were simply shown these images and\nthey were asked to rate how attractive\ndoes this person look how healthy does\nthis person look and how tired did does\nthis person look and again they knew\nnothing about what was going on sure\nenough with very high statistical\nprobability when the the head shot that\nwas taken when they were underslept they\nrated that indiv idual as looking less\nattractive as looking more sickly in\nterms of their appearance and also\nlooking more tired so first they had\nproven this thing called beauty sleep\nthat you look a more attractive version\nof you when you are getting sufficient\nsleep but they also noticed this\nsickliness sort of composition to\nsomeone's face so that's a very long way\nof explaining the bags under the eyes\nI'm sorry I go off in these tangents\nAndrew and not a mentioned at all I\nasked you answered and um and here we\nare okay so you've been explaining the\ndifferent dimensions of sleep the\nunderlying\nphysiology some of the psychological and\nphysiological consequences of getting\nnot enough sleep enough sleep\nEtc I think a question that everybody is\nasking themselves is a how much sleep\nshould they get and B what is really\ngreat sleep and then of course there are\nall these other parameters of sleep you\nknow leaving aside whether or not one\nsleeps you know a little bit reclined or\non their side Etc you know how should we\nthink about this activity that you're\ncalling sleep you how should we break it\ndown what are the variables that we need\nto think about in terms of being able to\nask ourselves how well or poorly we're\ndoing and for lack of a better way to\nput it to optimize our sleep so I think\nto me the question of what is good sleep\nat at first it seems to be obvious you\ncan come through again to your partner\nin the morning and they'll say how did\nyou sleep and you have an answer you\nknow I slept well or I don't think I did\nsleep well so we all have some\nsubjective sense but science for the\nmost part um science and and medicine\nhas usually used a singular rub rubric\nwhich I think is reasonable which is\nquantity so you would hear that okay how\nmuch sleep do we need and what would\nthat look like to be good sleep and the\nanswer is it's a quantity ative answer\nsomewhere between 7 to 9 hours well\nactually I would answer it differently\nif someone said um how much sleep does\nan average person need I would say about\n90 minutes\nmore if you look that's the answer you\nwould give every yeah yeah how much\nsleep do I need and I would say probably\nabout 90 minutes more if you look at the\naverage data but setting that 90 9 90\nmore uh if you look at based on the\nepidemiological studies of how much\npeople actually are getting\nbut that metric of quantity is the way\nthat most of us and I've been you know\ncertainly party to this as well have\nanswered the question as what is enough\nsleep or what would be a good amount of\nsleep and good amount of sleep would be\nsomewhere between 7 to n and that's the\ncurrent recommendation that's the\nrecommendation by many health\norganizations including here in the US\nwhich is the CDC they recommend or they\nstipulate a minimum of 7 hours for the\naverage adult to me however that doesn't\ncapture the true complexity that sleep\nreally is and it is as we've now\ndiscussed in the episode a wonderfully\ncomplex um ballet of of of physiology\nand so I've stepped back and i' really\ntried to think to me what are the main\ncomponents that would constitute this\nrecipe for good\nsleep and I've conceptualized what I\nwould describe as the four macros of\nsleep that there are you know we think\nof diet that we've got three macros fat\nprotein and carbohydrate for me sleep\nactually has four macros and you can\nremember this by the acronym\nqqr and it stands for quantity quality\nregularity and timing qqr T quantity\nquality regularity and timing and maybe\nI can just go into detail because I'm\ntelling you you know these are the the\nrules for good sleep no one responds to\nrules they respond to reasons and not\nrules so let me explain the reasons\nbehind each one of these so quantity\nwe've already spoken about somewhere\nbetween 7 to9 for the average adult let\nme move on to Quality we measure quality\nin a variety of different ways the first\nprinciple quality measure of sleep is\ncontinuity so meaning was your sleep\nnice and continuous and you didn't wake\nup many times or was your sleep\nfragmented and littered with many\nAwakenings it was punctuated by these\nthese Awakenings if it's very highly\nfragmented that's what we call poor\nquality of sleep that's low efficiency\nof sleep so maybe you would be in bed\nfor let's say 9 hours and you still got\n7 hours of sleep so if all you used was\nyour quantity measure you would say well\nyou've still had good sleep you've had 7\nhours but two of those hours have been\nspent awake summed total so that is very\nlow quality of sleep and it's what we\nwould call a low score of efficiency so\nif you're looking at any of your sleep\ntrackers that's probably best captured\nby Sleep efficiency what is sleep\nefficiency sleep efficiency is simply\ncalculated as of the total amount of\ntime in bed what percent of that time\nwill you asleep so if I was in bed for 8\nhours and I slept for 6 hours I would\nhave a sleep efficiency of\n75% because two out of the8 hours 25% of\nthat time I was awake and an efficiency\nthat is 85% or above we typically\nclassify as healthy sleep and we would\nlike to see you there or perhaps a\nlittle bit higher if you have a lower\nsleep efficienc score than that it\nusually means that you're awake too much\nof the time and we'll think about that\nand address that so that's one measure\nof the second Q of the qqr T that's\nquality but there's another measure that\nwe can also use that measure comes back\nto the deep sleep that we spoke about\nand particularly the electrical quality\nof those brain waves so you can have\ndeep sleep and it can be of different\nqualities electrical qualities you can\nhave deep sleep that is is immensely\npowerful with huge epic waves or you can\nhave deep sleep that still is classified\nas deep sleep but it's a little bit more\nsort of anemic in its quality and you\ncan't really measure that with these\nsleep trackers we have to use electrodes\nand then we decompose the electrical\nbrain activity using a fancy equation\nand that tells us what was the amount of\nsort of strength of activity what we\ncall electrical power in that deep sleep\nregiment so that's another measure that\nwe use for\nQuality next is\nregularity regularity and actually I\nshould come back to to Quality for a\nlong time in sleep science we were using\nquantity as our major metric for\npredictability meaning I look at your\nquality and does it predict your\nlearning or your memory I look at your\nquantity and does it predict your blood\nsugar regulation I look at your Quant\nquanti does it predict your immune\nhealth I look at your quantity and does\nit predict your mortality risk and the\nanswer has been yes that it quantity\ndoes predict many of those things that's\ngreat what was interesting is that if\nyou look at the statistic of the\npredictability of quantity alone it was\nstrong it was significant but it still\nleft a lot of unexplained what we call\nvariance so the it must be that there is\nsome other things in sleep that are\nexplaining these Health metrics in\naddition to quantity and quality has now\ncome online I think in the past 10 years\nas carrying as much if not perhaps even\nmore in certain domains of a predictive\nstrength in determining your mental and\nyour physical health that quantity has\nand it at least forced me in my own\nresearch to a always be me measuring\nquality in as high resolution as I can\nand always including it into a\nstatistical model and we can do fancy\nthings where we put those two things you\nknow pit them head-to head and see which\none actually holds more of the\nstatistical weight but certainly quality\nsleep is as important I would say now at\nleast as important as the quantity of\nsleep now you can't short Change on\neither you can't say okay did he just\ntell me that I should not worry about\nhow long I'm sleeping but as long so you\ncan't just get 4 hours of sleep that is\nincredibly good quality and get away\nwith it but you also can't be in bed for\n9 hours or 10 hours getting 7 hours of\nsleep but it's really bad quality of\nsleep you have to get both you can't\nshort Change either one of those so at\nthat point you think well isn't that the\nend of the story The QQ why do you need\nthis R and T of qqr t\nthe the regularity has come online I\nwould say in the past 18 months as being\na relevant metric when I say you you\nwould say well hang on a second\nregularity and timing they sound like\nthe same when I say regularity I mean\nwhen you go to bed and when you wake up\nif you keep that consistent that is the\nthird piece of the the four macros\nthat's regularity I go to bed at the\nsame time I wake up at the same time\nplus minus how much so I would say plus\nor minus you know 30 minutes you kind of\nthat's your wiggle room you don't want\nto try and everyone you know even I I\nhave a I'm furly puritanical about my\nsleep not because I want to be some post\na child and practice what I preach it's\nsimply that if you knew everything I did\nabout sleep it's an entirely selfish act\nto prioritize my sleep I don't want to\ndie any sooner than I have to and I\ndon't want to live with disease any\nlonger and the greatest health insurance\npolicy that I know of that is\nuniversally available largely free and\nmostly painless is this thing called the\nnight of sleep so I'll gift it to myself\nevery single night I don't see it as\nselfish because of course uh when we are\nill or dead um there is a burden on\nothers um it's it can be an absence\nburden or a or a presence burden\ndepending depending depending on what\nand how people please look at me when\nyou say presence about us but um that's\ninteresting now when you say uh same\nwake up time same to sleep time plus or\nminus 30 minutes for each of those uh is\nthat plus or minus 30 minutes uh getting\ninto bed or are we talking about falling\nasleep entering that first stage one\nit's really from the time of lights out\nso okay I've been in bed and you know I\nI got into bed at the same time but last\nnight I went to sleep about an hour\nlater and then the night before you know\nI I got into bed I just turned the\nlights out and and then you\nknow two nights ago I got into bed again\nat the same time but then I was kind of\nonline shopping and I started chatting\nwith a friend in a different time zone\nand then it was 2 and a half hours later\nbefore lights out that is what we would\nclassify as irregular sleep and the\nreason that this this has really been\nforced on me as important there was a\ngreat study that came\nout maybe I'll get this wrong from about\n5 months from the time of filming this\nago and it was it used a huge database\nsomething called the UK biobank which is\na wonderful database and they looked at\nover 60,000 individuals and they looked\nthey were able to track the sleep from\none night to the next to the next to the\nnext so they had some Metric of this\nconsistency this\nregularity and then they split those\n60,000 individual into\nquartiles and in the St statistical\nmodel they looked at people who were\nmost regular versus people who were\nleast\nregular and they tracked them over\nyears what they found and then they\nlooked at their mortality risk How\nlikely was it that those people would\npass away during that study inter uh\ninterval and they were also able to map\nwhat were they dying of if they passed\naway so what they found was that those\npeople who are in the top quarti of\nbeing most regular relative to those\npeople who are highly irregular if you\nhad good regular sleep you had a\n49% reduced risk of mortality relative\nto someone who was very\nirregular of that General allca\nmortality risk when you split it apart\nthere was um a 35% decrease in cancer\nmortality specifically and there was\nalmost a 60% drisking of\ncardiovascular mortality risk if you are\nregular versus\nirregular then they did this brilliant\nthing because they were measuring both\nthe quantity of sleep and when these\nindividuals were sleeping they did what\nI just said which is they put them into\na statistical model sure enough the\nquantity of sleep just as we've shown\ntime and in time again was very\npredictive of all cause mortality using\nthat sweet spot of 7 to n hours and we\ncan speak about what happens when you\nstart to sleep longer because it's it's\nactually very unpredicted and it's very\ninteresting but sweet spot of 7 to9 the\nshorter your sleep the shorter your life\nthat's what the data seems to suggest\nbut what they found was that that was\ntrue yet regularity or irregular sleep\ncarried almost twice the effect size the\nmagnitude of predictability that\nduration did and I think the whole field\nwe knew that regularity I knew that\nregularity was important I don't think\nwe understood how important and the\nstrength of mortality drisking if you're\nregular or increased risk if you're\nirregular that this metric of R carried\nin the qqr T equation so I've started to\nbe much more mindful myself at least and\nalmost over index\nthat um the final aspect comes on to\ntiming and I should say that we've we've\nused this essentially this kind of\nequation this sleep algorithm as it were\nof qqr now in a lot of my work in the\npast at the Sleep Center in the past\nfour or five years and it does seem to\nbe a pretty good proxy of covering\npredictive wise many aspects of your\nhealth that if you use any one of these\nby themselves yeah they they help they\npredict things but if you use them as a\ncollective that seems to be where you\nexplain most of the variant now it's not\na by far a perfect measure there are\neven more nuanced ways that you would\nwant to split it and I want to split it\nbut I would say that this is a pretty\ngood proxy for the general public and it\nseems to be in our research a pretty\ngood proxy for for health and wellness\ntoo the final aspect of the qqr quantity\nquality regularity comes on to timing\nhow is timing different to regularity\nbecause regularity is about getting your\nsleep at the same correct time what I\nmean by timing is your chronotype so\npeople may have heard of this phrase are\nyou a morning type evening type or\nsomewhere in\nbetween that it turns out is and it's\nabout a third third split across the\npopulation maybe a little bit different\ndoes it divide up any differently\naccording to male female and here I'm\npresumably we're not talking about\nchildren or teenagers that's a whole\nother business and we'll talk about that\nyeah yeah so once you are an adult and\nthat because that pattern of your timing\nof sleep does change during development\nvery much so despite you know we can all\nremember being kids and wanting to stay\nup with the grown-ups and and all of a\nsudden the last thing we remember was\nyou know 7:00 comes around 8:00 comes\naround and you think great we're I'm\ngoing to stay up until 10: or 11:00 with\nthem and then you wake up the next\nmorning cuz you were carried to bed cuz\nshe was lights out so setting that aside\nonce you're an adult and you have your\nstable rhythm in place um it there there\nis variability now in sleep science we\nbreak it down not into three categories\nbut five extreme morning type morning\ntype a neutral evening type extreme\nevening type could you repeat those\nagain so extreme morning extreme morning\ntype so what what qualifies as extreme\nmorning type so an extreme morning type\nwould someone who would like to say go\nto bed around uh 8:00 p.m. and then they\nwould be you know waking up and they\nwake up very easily around 4: 4:30 a.m.\nin the morning and they're bright as a\nbunny they are ready to get to the gym\nand I'm a neutral I just sit right in\nthe middle so I'm kind of an 11 to 7:30\nkind of guy okay maybe we could walk\nthrough the so the extreme morning type\nis um around 8 and they could be they\ncould wake up at let's say 4: 4:30 and\nthey would be fine um a a morning type\nmaybe they would like to go to bed\naround\n9:30 and then they're waking up closer\nto sort of\n5:36 then you've got a neutral like me\nand I would like to go to bed probably\naround 11: p.m. and wake up around sort\nof\n7:30ish I try to give myself about an 8\nand a half hour time period in bed um\nand then you get get to the um the night\nowls um so then you've got the evening\ntype and then the extreme evening type\nwhich finishes out the 4 five the\nevening type maybe they would like to go\nto bed like\n12:31 and probably wake up around maybe\n9\n9:30 and then you've got the extreme\nevening type and they are not ready for\nbed until maybe 2:30 3:00 a.m.\nand they're waking up you know middle of\nthe\nmorning so what's interesting about your\nchronotype and by the way people you can\nif you want to find out your chronotype\nif you want an actionable suggestion you\ncan just um go online and you can search\nfor something called just type in\nchronotype\nmeq and that stands for the morningness\neveningness questionnaire\nmeq just type in chronotype meq and you\nwill see you can fill it out it takes 3\n4 minutes series of questions and it\nwill give you back a score and that will\nthen bucket you into these different\nflavors and sort of say okay I've tried\nall of these and you okay and I I hate\nto admit it but if I had my preference I\nwould go to\nsleep at 8 8:30 and wake up at 4:30 or\nso well let me ask ask you this question\nbecause rather than doing the meq I\nthere's a single question I normally ask\nand say okay Andrew I now put you on a\ndesert island alone and alone you you've\ngot nothing to wake up for no\nelectricity no responsibilities no\nnothing what time do you think your body\nwould like to go to sleep and wake up\nand I say that specifically because if I\nask you what time would you like to\nyou're still biased in your head by all\nof the trappings of society and this\nterrible towards morning types do you\nthink that naturally that's probably the\nregiment that you would do yeah great\nquestion I would go to sleep sometime\nbetween 90 and 120 minutes after Sundown\nyeah okay so that's why I I was going to\nanswer I'm either an extreme morning\ntype or a morning type I can go to bed\naround 9:30 wake up at 5:00 feeling\ngreat um or go to sleep early 8 8:30\nwake up at 4: and really want to get up\nand write and exercise now that's not\nthe schedule I follow I may uh start to\nfollow that schedule I've tried for\nvarious um portions of my life but\ntypically I end up defaulting to going\nto sleep a bit later 10 10:30 waking up\naround okay 6 6:30 and that's assuming\nthat there are no events in my life that\nare disrupting my sleep because then I'm\nreally going to sleep in if I can and a\nbunch of things to try and complate but\nassuming everything is cool in life um\nand in the room that I sleep um\nthat's the spirit there you go I would\nsay going to sleep at 9 and waking up at\num yeah about 4:35 a.m. it feels great\nin fact I always thought of it as a bit\nof an anti-depressant feel I I don't\nconsider myself somebody who's depressed\nbut I can get a little low level malaise\nif I'm staying up till 11:30 12 and even\nwaking up at 7:00 I don't feel quite\nright and when I go to bed early and\nwake up early I feel really really good\nyou do all day long and what's\ninteresting about that is it works both\nways so that malaise that you're\nspeaking\nabout also happens for evening types who\nare forced to be M types unsympathetic\nno I'm kidding just kid just just\nkidding I mean Society is we are\ndesperately biased towards the the\nmorning types and we chastise and\nstigmatize evening types as being\nslothful or lazy that they just can't\nget it together why can't you be at the\ngym you know at 6:00 a.m. and in the\noffice by 9:30 what's wrong 7:30 what's\nwrong with you I'm chuckling because I\nwas weaned in Academia and the late Ben\nBaris who was my postto adviser and then\nlater a uh a colleague that\nunfortunately he passed away in uh 2017\nbut he used to say I don't do mornings\nnow he was our department chair at the\ntime but he would just say I don't do\nmornings but he would come in around 11:\na.m. or noon but he would stay until 3:\nin the morning I feel like there's been\na a cultural shift I feel like um 10\nyears ago if you were the person who\nstayed late at the office or the lab you\nwere considered a hard worker right but\ngetting in early at that time it seems\nwas not as rewarded nowadays maybe\nsomething's just changed in my world but\nI feel like the um the person who gets\nin first kind of gets the prize in terms\nof the the um psychological credential\nyeah I think there is there is that um\nreward bias that's given it's this\nnotion you know the early bird catches\nthe worm so I think the we we're\ndesperately unkind Society is engineered\ntowards morning types it's engineered\nagainst evening types the reason that\nthat's not fair is that this and I'll\ncome back to timing again and and how it\nworks and why it's important and the\nfourth ingredient the fourth macro but\ncoming to\nchronotype the reason it's unfair is\nthat it's not your fault that your\nchronotype is largely genetically\ndictated and we Now understand that\nthere are at least 22 different genes\nwhich augment your chronotype which\ndetermine your chronotype in other words\nit is gifted to you at Birth it's\nhardwired and it is not your fault yet\nwe still have this stigma and this this\nI think\ndisgraceful you know not only under\nappreciation but almost this kind of Ry\nlook evening types are of a certain kind\nnot very favorably viewed so think about\nit this way you would never let's think\nabout another trait um eye color that is\nyou know genetically determined and you\nwere to look at me and you would say ah\nhe's got blue eyes you know um it's just\nyou're kind of lazy because you've got\nblue eyes oh you've got green eyes gosh\nthat's wonderful that's well done\ncongratulations wait a second it's not I\nI didn't get the choice it's genetic\nwas the same with your chronotype but\ncoming back to why me I included it in\nthis sort of algorithm of what is good\nsleep if I were to take a an extreme\nmorning type and force them to stay\nawake until midnight they're going to be\nincredibly tired they're going to be so\ntired and they're going to be grumpy and\nmiserable and they will have no problem\nfalling asleep the problem however is\nthat they're still going to because of\ntheir C their natural chronotype which\nin which determines your Cadian Rhythm\nso everyone has this 24-hour circadian\nrhythm as you know you've been a\nwonderful proponent of that and done\nincredible work in this area we all have\nthis 24-hour Rhythm and it looks like a\nsinusoidal wave it sort of goes up and\nwe as a dial species were active and\nawake during the day and then you get\nthis awesome downswing at night and\nwe're inactive at night and it steps and\nrepeats it's just 24 4our cycle everyone\nhas that so what's why doesn't everyone\nfit the same chronotype timing model of\nsleep if we all have a 24-hour clock\nwell what's different is that where that\nPeak and that trough sit on the 24-hour\nclock face varies from one individual to\nthe next and that is what we call\nchronotype so this comes back to why\nit's important the morning type they are\nin their all their awesome downswing of\nthe Cadian Rhythm at midnight and they\nare miserable they're desperate for\nsleep and when you put them into bed at\nmidnight 4 hours later than they would\notherwise they are gone the problem is\ntheir Cadian Rhythm now starts to climb\nback up around 4:30 in the morning and\neven though they went to bed at midnight\nthey're probably going to wake up\nartificially before the 8 hour or 7 to9\nhour completion and they're going to be\nshort slept on the back end of sleep\nthis happens to me many many times I\nwant to go to bed around 8:30 or 9 but\nfor social or work reasons I stay up\nuntil 11:30 or 12 I fall asleep very\neasily yep almost always have fallen\nasleep easily and then 3:34 in the\nmorning I'm awake and you cannot get\nit's almost as though you tell I tend to\ndo this yoga NRA non-sleep deep rest and\nsometimes I can fall back asleep that\nway but often times it's a struggle and\nso I've been and it's a struggle because\nof your chronotype and your Cadian\nRhythm which is on its wonderful piston\nupswing now apologies for the Motorsport\nreference but I obsessed yeah I can't\nhelp myself I'm sorry Matt's a big F1\nfan folks just as is Peter AA so anyway\nthe awesome upswing that you're\nexperiencing for your Cadian Rhythm\nprevents you from sleeping in further\nbut now let's reverse the table let's\ntake the evening type and I put them\ninto bed at 900 p.m. or 10: p.m. when\nnormally they will not be ready for\nsleep until 1 a.m. and they're lying in\nbed and they are wide awake and they\ncannot fall\nasleep and this is the principal reason\nthat I will get evening types coming to\nme and they'll say look I think I've got\nterrible insomnia I just have and there\nare you know you can think about\ninsomnia in lots of different ways but\nthere may be two broad categories one is\nthat you have sleep onset insomnia I\ncan't fall asleep well the second is I\nhave sleep maintenance insomnia which is\nthe sort of the thing that you were\ndescribing which is where and you don't\nhave I don't think you have insomnia but\nI'm just as an example you fall asleep\nquickly but you can't stay asleep that's\nthe maintenance insomnia so they will\ncome to me with the opposite of your\nconcern which just they say I just\ncannot fall asleep and I say okay let me\njust ask you a few questions and we go\nthrough the chronotype questionnaire and\nit's very clear that they are an evening\ntype and you know there's lots of\ndifferent things that you would want to\nexclude to make sure they don't have\ninsomnia and then you can say you\nactually don't have insomnia you you're\njust an evening type and you're going to\nbed at the wrong moment in time and if\nyou to try to go to bed at midnight\nyou're not going to suffer from the\nproblems that you have and you'll sleep\nthrough later but of course their\nresponse is well I need to be in work by\nyou know 800 a.m. and I've got an hour\ncommute so I have to be awake at 6:30 so\nI need to be in bed by\n10 so on both of these ends you can see\nthat the morning type who goes to bed\ntoo late falls asleep easily but can't\nstay asleep the evening type who is\nforced to go to bed too early they can't\nfall asleep but then they stay asleep\nand when the alarm goes off at 6:30 a.m.\nthey don't want to wake up so this is\nwhy when you sleep out of synchrony with\nyour chronotype things do not look good\nso in those two circumstances let's say\nthat I standardize it everyone is going\nto go to bed at 1 p.m. and wake up at\n6:00 a.m. and let's say that we've got a\na morning type not an extreme morning\ntype who kind of likes to go to bed\naround\n9:45 they are going to sleep very well\nit's very close to the Natural Rhythm so\nand then I get an extreme even even in\ntype who likes to go to bed at 2: a.m.\nand I have them sleep the same\nopportunity amount 8 hours at the very\nsame time well surely they should be\nidentical they're not going to be it's\nnot that they don't have the same\nopportunity they do eight hours it's\njust that one is placed at the\ninappropriate time on the 24-hour clock\nfor the evening type but appropriately\nfor the morning type and thus the\nquality of sleep that they each have is\nvery different and that's why you always\nneed to build into a metric of what is\ngood sleep it's not just about quantity\nor quality or getting it regular it's\nalso about where do you place your sleep\nopportunity window on that 24-hour clock\nface to align with your chronotype when\nyou fight biology you normally lose and\nthe way you know you've lost is disease\nand sickness that's why to me that final\ntea of qqr t\nis so critical does that sort of unpack\nand explain this this beautifully yes\nbeautifully and as you were finishing up\nthere I was thinking that um first of\nall we've heard of Corona types or many\nof us have but I the way you described\nit is um makes it extremely clear as to\nwhy this almost has to be the case\nbecause if we think about the extreme\nexample of mistimed sleep which is shift\nwork you know being awake at night and\nsleeping during the day you know\nessentially nobody has that chronotype\nyeah um but people force it upon\nthemselves and by the way thank you\nshift workers we need you um you know if\nI have an appendicitis at 4:00 a.m. in\nthe morning I'm very grateful for people\nwho can help save my life right truckers\nAirline employees and on and on y um\nnurses Etc parents taking care of kids\nin the middle of the night that shift\nwork but we know that there are health\nissues associated with being nocturnal\nand sleep injuring the day um but of\ncourse there are a bunch of other\nvariables like lack of a avability of\nsunlight if you're sleeping during the\nday and you're um and you're awake at\nnight but I realized there's no reason\nto think that one can slide their sleep\ntiming um around even by a few hours and\nstill get away with it in other words\nthis notion of chronotypes makes perfect\nsense it's just that the shift work is\nthe most extreme example of being out of\nsyn with your with your with your\nchronotype so I'm certainly going to\ntake this chronotype test but I'll tell\nyou right now if I could get to sleep\ntonight at at 9: and wake up at 4: that\nwould I that feel so good I'm going to\nput you in my car I'm going to do an\nintervention you are going to be in bed\nby 9:00 this evening non-negotiable fair\nenough is um yeah well so we have q qrt\nright quantity quality regularity and\ntiming how do we know if we're getting\nenough sleep and you know uh this is\nsomething that you know you say 7 to n\nhours um I've heard well if you're\nfeeling alert during the day but perhaps\nhave just a little bit of that postp\nperenial dip is that I get that right um\nthen you're probably okay but presumably\nthere's some other ways to to gauge\nwhether or not we're getting enough\nsleep or not so there are certainly some\nways that we do it in science and\nclinically but let's let's let those go\nfor a second and just say for people\nlistening what are some very easy tests\nI think the first test that I would\noffer is if you if your alarm clock\ndidn't go off tomorrow morning would you\nsleep past your alarm clock and if the\nanswer is yes which for many people it\nwill be then you're not getting enough\nsleep you know no other species as well\nby the way artificially terminates their\nsleep it's so\ninteresting but we humans will do it\nwe'll wrench ourselves out of sleep now\nI told you that regularity is key and I\ndo have an alarm clock I usually wake up\nclose to it or a little bit before for\nit so I do Advocate an alarm clock in\nfact I would argue that you should have\ntwo alarm clocks you should have a toed\nalarm clock and to wake alarm clock you\nwe only most of us only use an alarm\nclock in the morning why don't we have\nit to tell us when it's time to go to\nbed so I have both of those so I would\nsay that it's it's good to use to keep\nyourself regular but truly if you would\nsleep past that alarm time then you're\nprobably not you're not done with sleep\nyour body isn't done with sleep and\nanimals would not would never do that\nand so I think that's the first metric\nanother metric sometimes it's not that\nincredibly specific but have you ever\nbeen driving day after day after day and\nsometimes you think I don't know if that\nlight was red or green that I just went\nthrough inattentiveness your driving\nman um bite your tongue Walker bite your\ntongue so that was you\nmay have been that's that's one you know\npotential concern in fact one of the\nways that we've developed a metric for\ndose response to sleep deprivation is\nusing concentration and alertness tests\nso in other words if there is a\nbreathalyzer for a lack of sleep doing\nthese concentration Focus concentration\ntests is they are so sensitive they're\nso\npredictive you get people just to focus\non a screen and start to do very basic\nstimulus response and they can do that\nfor the first minute two with stimulus\nresponse um for those that don't know\nmight be uh uh three letters pop up on a\nscreen and then you're you you pick uh\ntwo keys uh you you have access to two\nkeys on a keyboard um if the if there're\ntwo letters that are similar you press\nright right key if there there's only\none there aren't two or more layers that\nare similar you press left key simple\nsimple things but we have to pay\nattention to a rule that's right you're\njust doing a lot of different um uh\nTrials of different rules and it just\nbecomes monotonous it's not really very\nchallenging you have P ATT and that\nperfectly mimics in some ways but we\ndon't do it for two or three minutes\nwe'll have you do it for 10 minutes and\nmy goodness is it mind numbing I mean\nit's kind of just but it mimics very\nwell think about you know just even a\n1hour road trip at 10:00 in the evening\nand you're on the way the freeway all\nyou've got to do is just focus on the\nroad and the white lies are coming and\nthere's nothing much to do and you've\ngot to attend and focus not for 10\nminutes but for 60 minutes when you are\nunderslept one of the dangerous the big\nproblems with a lack of sleep is that\nyou don't know you are sleep deprived\nwhen you are sleep deprived and we know\nthis because when I'm tracking your\nperformance object ly it's going down\nand down and down but when I'm asking\nyou subjectively how do you think you're\ndoing in terms of your performance you\nsay I'm hanging in there so far I'm I'm\ngood so subjectively you think you're\nfine but objectively you're not the\nanalogy would be a drunk driver at a bar\nyou know they've had seven or eight\nbeers they've had six shots and they\npick up the car keys and they say to you\nlook I'm fine to drive home and your\nresponse is no I know that you\nsubjectively think you're fine to drive\nbut trust me objectively you're not I'll\njust call you a taxi don't worry it's\nit's fine it's the same way with a lack\nof sleep so I make this point about\ngoing through the traffic lights because\nyou can have these lapses of attention\nand these lapses of attention are caused\nby micro sleeps micro sleeps happen when\nthe brain just very briefly it's almost\nlike one of those toy ducks that kind of\ndips its bill into the water and then\nsort of comes back up again and dips\nyour brain just drops down and has a\nquick sample of sleep and micro sleep\nand we can measure it in your eyelid\nthat your eyelid starts to have what's\ncalled a partial closure and it just\nkind of goes half the way over or it\ncloses fully shut that's a micros sleep\neven when it's half open your brain is\nessentially offline it's in a sleep-like\nstate we can measure it and then it\ncomes back online so I bring that that's\na very long way of saying that's the\nsecond metric I would use are you having\nthese absences where you just kind of\nlapse another is that you mentioned it\nbefore I just don't feel restored um you\ncould say look I I sleep for probably\naround about 7 and 3/4 hours every night\nbut I just don't I don't feel awake I\ndon't feel refreshed I don't so can you\noperate without needing caffeine and\nhave good grace good mood and good\ncognition without needing caffeine\nbefore 11:\na.m. in the morning and if the answer is\nno you may be self-medicating your state\nof insufficient sleep but that metric of\nsaying I sleep 7 hours and 45 minutes\nthat's what my sleep tracker says but I\ndon't feel refreshed that comes to the\nsecond que of\nqqr sufficient quantity of sleep my\nguess is that I would then look at the\nquality of your sleep and we probably\nfind a deficiency in the quality of your\nsleep so there are these different sort\nof tools that you can use but a good one\nis do you feel refreshed and restored by\nyour sleep it's not a guarantee any of\nthese but in order to answer that\nquestion do you feel refreshed and\nrestored by your sleep could we dig just\na little bit into some of the Contour of\nthe day so uh if I get a good night's\nsleep which for me means going to sleep\nearly waking up early which tonight we\nare ABS that's the plan I wake up uh\npretty quickly I'm alert upon wake up\nmaybe 5 10 minutes to get out of a semi-\ngroggy state but sometimes I'm just\neyelids open I'm ready to go um is the\nuh latency from wakeup time to uh full\nalertness is that a relevant metric the\nother question is whether or not um the\npostp perenial dip is a relevant metric\nuh we established already that it's\nnatural to feel a bit of an energetic\ndip at somewhere in the afternoon I\nthink you said between 1 and 4 p.m. 1\nand 4 yeah yeah something like that uh\nfor me that's true between the hours of\n2: and 300 p.m. um assuming all other\nthings equal I just experienced that no\nmatter what um but I could imagine some\npeople are really dragging in the\nafternoon and they would like to know is\nthat the normal postp parial dip or is\nthat a reflection of not getting\nadequate sleep is there any way that we\ncould just dig into these two times of\nday as as a it's kind of a um a measure\nuh of evaluating one's\nduration and quality of sleep a little\nbit more beautiful questions I would say\nthat one should not take necessarily\neither of those two as your best metric\nthe reason is the wakeup component for\nsome people like you you're waking up\nand you are good to go pretty much out\nthe gate many people however will\nexperience something called Sleep\ninertia which is this it's almost this\njust period of time it's a bit like a\nsleep hangover the first hour\nI'm going to have to come back to a car\nanalogy it's like a classic car engine\nwhere you don't just pull out and you\ncan rev it and it's you know it just\nneeds you need to warm it up gradually\nbring the the oil temps up and the and\nat that point after about an hour you're\nup to operating temperature and you're\ngood to go it's the sense of okay I walk\nthrough into the kitchen\nand sort of your partner maybe looks at\nthe dishes and I say I know darling I\nknow I said I was going to wash the\ndishes I I so sorry I forgot but can I\njust have my cup of coffee and I'll be\nthe very best version of myself in about\nan hour can we discuss it then because\nright now I'm not the best version of\nmyself that's sleep inertia and that is\nnatural for many people now if you are\nan evening type and you're waking up\nearly you're going to have a much\nheavier sleep inertia period than you\nwould do that is natural to you but I\nwouldn't necessarily use that as the the\ndirect measure because many people will\nhave sleep inera and if you do you may\nget worried if I say oh it's the very\nbest measure that you're not getting\nquality of sleep the postp prial dip as\nyou mentioned there before even you the\nthe the Monumental um organism called\nAndrew hubman even you can fall prey to\nthat and do fall pre to so that's\nperfect I've actually learned to love it\nI just love it you know here it comes\nand I okay that's my circadian rhythm um\nwe'll talk more about circadian rhythm\nin a few minutes but um and if I can get\n10 to 15 minutes of shut eye time in\nthat postp perenial dip then I really\nlove it and you yeah and I bounce right\nout of that and we'll speak about how we\nwere designed to sleep maybe in in a\nlater episode two and whether that\nshould be the way human beings are\nsleeping so I wouldn't necessarily use\nthat I'm I always have this postp penial\ndip does that mean I should be be\nworried about sleep I would say that if\nyou have excessive daytime sleepiness\nthroughout the day where you're\nconstantly tired and that is a term that\nwe use in in sleep medicine is excessive\ndaytime sleepiness um or EDS um that\nshould be of a concern I would use a\nslightly different metric of the same\nquestion but at a different time of day\nlet's think about that Cadian rhythm\nagain for most people even if you're a\nmorning type or evening type by about 11\na.m. by about 11:00 a.m. midday you're\nreally starting to get to your Peak you\nknow most people are somewhere either\nside of the peak or around that Peak I\nwould say that if you are feeling groggy\nand not alert and awake at 11 11:30\ndepending on your chronotype I would use\nthat as probably the better metric of my\ndaytime\nsleepiness but and by the way it's very\ninteresting that that Peak if you look\nat that c Peak when you're at your\noptimal it's both your optimal for your\nbrain but it's also for your body it's\nthe point at which your core body\ntemperat just starts to\nPeak that's the moment where you have\noptimal physiology and when you look at\nworld records that have been broken in\nthe Olympics and you plot them on the\nbasis of time of day you see this\nincredible beautiful Spike where most\npeople are breaking World Records right\nin that Cadian sweet spot around that\nmidday Peri period why it's because\nthat's the period where human physiology\nseems to be at its optimal thermal\ntemperature at least it's fascinating\nfascinating right around sometime\nbetween 11:00 a.m. and 1 1 1 p.m. p.m.\nyeah depending on what time somebody\ngoes to sleep and wakes up correct yeah\nand what time their chronotype is and\nthat will very but on average because\nfor me would be my Peak alertness and\nand physical\nability uh work output\num is somewhere between 10: a.m. and\nnoon yeah y yeah and that fits both with\nyour brain and my guess is that if we\nwere to get you into the gym and have\nyou go through your routine and see if\nwe could do that routine once we've got\na basil metric set of metrics I will\nhave you do it at 7 a.m. then have you\ndo it at 9:00 a.m. then do it at midday\nthen 300 p.m. then 6 p.m. and then 10\np.m. same workout same human being but\nthere will be definitive periods of time\nin the day when you are optimal and my\nguess is that that optimality of brain\nis matched by optimality of body such\nthat your Peak Performance output and\nlet's say your Peak jump height or your\nPeak muscle strength would be right\naround those time periods that fit with\nyour own Cadian chronotype rhythmicity\nso you've been talking about this\n24-hour oscillation in sleep wake\nactivity called the Circadian rhythm\nmaybe we can drill a little bit deeper\ninto the Circadian rhythm you know what\nis it um what can shift it if it indeed\ncan shift and I'm especially curious\nabout forces other than the Circadian\nrhythm that have an impact on sleepiness\nsleep and wakefulness so the way we\nthink about it in sleep science and\nthere is some argument that it's maybe\neven more complex than this but for the\nmost part there are two main forces two\nmain processes that will determine when\nyou want to be awake and when you want\nto be asleep the first of those we've\nspoken about which is your Cadian Rhythm\nand that Cadian\nrhythm is um you have a clock inside of\nyour brain you have a central 24-hour\nclock and it's a master clock and that\nclock as you've spoken about many times\nis called the supermatic nucleus we\ndon't have to get hung up on the the\nstatement just think about it as your\nmaster 24-hour clock and it beats out\nthis rhythmic sort of message of\nactivity for us because we're dianal\nduring the day and then inactivity at\nnight activity during the day and it\njust goes up and down up and down every\nsingle day that's your Cadian Rhythm and\nthat's the superism the reason I say\nit's the Master Clock we've now learned\nthat there are these Cadian Rhythm\nclocks in almost all cells of the body\nyou've got clocks all over your body in\nthese sort of they're tiny little clocks\nbut a little bit like Lord of the Rings\njust like there's one ring to rule them\nall well there's one clock to rule them\nall and that is the central brain clock\nthe supermatic nucleus now you can\ndissociate those different clocks and\nyou can get them kind of doing some\nfunky things but for the most part it's\nthe central Time\nGiver so you would think that well\nthat's all you need to tell your brain\nand your body it's time to sleep or it's\ntime to be awake it's not there is a\nsecond force in place here and it is\ncalled proc or we sometimes call it as\nprocess s or sleep pressure so you've\ngot your Cadian Rhythm on the one hand\ngoing up and down every 24 hours but\nthen you've got this funny thing called\nSleep pressure sleep pressure comes down\nto a chemical that is called adenosine\nso from the moment that you and I woke\nup this morning and everyone listening a\nchemical has been building up in your\nbrain that chemical is called adenosine\nand the more of it that builds up the\nsleepier and sleepier you will feel and\nafter about 16 or so hours of being\nawake there is enough of that sleepiness\nchemical that\nadenosine um sleep pressure by the way\nit is a chemical pressure it's not a\nmechanical pressure you don't have to\nworry that your head's going to explode\nuh if you go longer than 16 hours a week\nbut that sleep pressure is going to\nstart weighing down you on your\nshoulders and you you can sense that\nfeeling where you start to think ah it's\nyou're watching television you you're\nstarting to go down sort of the hill and\nyou think I should go to bed I'm I'm\ntired now that's because of one of two\nthings that's happening firstly you're\ngetting to that Peak Crescendo of\nadenosine where it's just getting so\npowerful that it's knocking you over and\nyou're ready for sleep usually when you\nare in synchrony with all of your\nbiology these two forces your Cadian\nRhythm that goes up and down every 24\nhours and your sleep pressure align in\nthis beautiful sort of frister Ginger\nRogers dance partnership and they're in\nharmony the strange thing is that they\nknow nothing about each other and they\ndon't care about each other one does not\ninfluence the other they are completely\ntoo independent things but let me run it\nout in the normal circumstance and then\nI'll describe to you a good example of\nhow I can separate those two and show\nyou that they're truly independent so\nnormally when we're in a sort of stable\nrhythm of sleep wake activity were awake\nduring the day we've got this awesome\nupswing of orcadian rhythm and then in\nthe evening let's just take you for\nexample as you're getting into that sort\nof 8 00 p.m. region your circadian\nrhythm has finished its peak many hours\nago and it's now starting to descend\ndown and you're getting onto the Steep\nphase of its downward sort of stroke of\nits awesome downward movement but also\ndon't forget that at that moment your\nsleep pressure your adenosine is also\nnow at its peak you've been awake for\nnow almost 6 hours so the moment when\nyour Cadian rhythm is on its nice\ndownward swing and your highest in your\nlevels of adenosine in your sleep\npressure that's the moment truly that\nwill determine okay now is when I feel\nnice and sleepy so then what happens\nthen you go to sleep you come down that\ncurve of your Cadian Rhythm and you kind\nof hit its Nader its lowest point in the\nmiddle of your sleep phase but also when\nyou go to sleep that second factor of\nsleep\npressure you are your brain gets the\nchance to clear away that adenosine and\nit seems to be about a 7 to n hour\nperiod of sleep is enough time for your\nbrain to jettison all of that adenosine\nthat has been building up across the 16\nhours of Prior wakefulness and then\nthese two things align beautifully again\nwhen it comes to your natural wakeup\ntime you've been asleep for let's say 7\nand 1 half hours you've cleared out all\nof that adenosine so you no longer have\nthe weight of that sleepiness pushing\nyou down but also your Cadian rhythm is\nnow on its awesome upswing and when\nthose two things align when you've\ndissipated and jettisoned all of that\nsleep pressure and your Cadian rhythm is\nstarting to rise now that's the time\nwhen you would naturally wake up so\nthat's things when they are working well\nand in\nalignment let's say that I now take you\nand I'm going to deprive you of sleep\nfor 24 hours so now coming into sort of\n10 p.m. your Cadian rhythm is dropping\ndown and your adenosine is starting to\nget high and by about 2 a.m. you're\nprobably not going to be happy by about\n4 a.m. or 5: a.m. you're miserable why\nbecause you've now been awake let's say\nfor almost 20 hours straight so you've\ngot all of this excess sleepiness\nadenosine pushing you down screaming at\nyou you've been awake for 20 hours and\nyour circadian rhythm is at its lowest\npoint desperately wanting to pull you\ninto this thing called sleep and you\nfeel terrible but then something strange\nhappens by 11:00 in the morning relative\nto let's say you know four you've now\nbeen awake for many more hours still so\nyou've built up up even more adenosine\nso the prediction would be that if it's\njust adenosine alone that makes the\ndifference you should feel even worse at\n11:00 a.m. you don't you feel better\ndespite being awake for longer why\nbecause your Cadian Rhythm has come to\nthe rescue and it's now starting its\nupswing and it lessens the distance\nbetween those two and you feel a little\nbit more alert but then as I push\nthrough later into the day by about 6:00\np.m. 7:00 p.m. you're now on your Cadian\ndown Swit once again and you've been\nawake for even longer and at that point\nthere's almost nothing that can keep you\nawake you're going to be falling asleep\non your feet and your toast but that's a\nnice demonstration of how you can\nseparate those two and despite one\ncontinuing on you can start to feel\nbetter because the other has come to\nyour rescue and that shows me that your\nCadian Rhythm doesn't care about how\nmuch adenosine is in your brain it's\njust going to keep going up and down up\nand down every 24 hours and your Denine\nlevel doesn't really care much about\nyour Cadian Rhythm it's going to just\nbuild and build and build the longer and\nlonger that you're awake and then get\ndissipated whenever it is that you sleep\nthe clearance of adenosine uh I'm\ncurious about it how does that work um\nso this chemical adenosine is building\nup in our brain does it also build up in\nthe body um it does but in the brain it\nhas this very interesting influence now\nI've described it as making you sleepier\nand it does that's exactly what it does\nbut it does it in a very very\ninteresting way it's a a bidirectional\nway there are at least two different um\nadenosine receptors or adenosine welcome\nsites within the brain and adenosine is\nvery clever in how it makes you sleepy\nadenosine as it's rising will turn down\nthe volume on the Wake promoting regions\nof your brain but yet will increase the\nvolume on your sleep promoting regions\nand by way of this Jewel action that's\nhow it seems to instigate this feeling\nof sleepiness by temping putting the\nbrakes on wakefulness but hitting the\naccelerator pedal on\nsleepiness but then adenosine seems to\nbe part or one of the reasons that it\nbuilds up is because it's a metabolic\nbyproduct of cellular activity of\ncellular metabol\nISM and it seems to be that the longer\nthat we're awake because our brain is\nvery cerebrally active during the day\neven though I told you that the brain\nstate of sleep is very active it is it's\na very metabolically active state of\nsleep it is less metabolically active\nhowever during deep non-rem sleep and it\nseems to be that it's deep non-r sleep\nthat is the principal time when we clear\nwe get the chance to clear away\nadenosine now now adenosine clearance is\nhappening all of the time it's just that\nthe rate of accumulation when we're\nawake exceeds the speed with which we\ncan naturally clear but when our brain\ngoes into deep non-rem sleep and becomes\nless metabolically active it's not as\nthough there's necessarily a more active\nor a very proactive state of Deep Sleep\ndoing that cleansing it's not it's the\nsame process of adenosine clearance it's\njust that there is no longer the\naccumulation that's happening so it gets\nthe chance to catch up on the days\nadenosine accumulation and then reduce\ndown that adenosine debt and then get\nyou to net net neutral by the morning in\nfact the amount of Deep Sleep the\nquality of that deep sleep that you're\ngetting specifically the electrical\nquality of your deep sleep is a very\ngood predictor of how well you dissipate\nthat sleepiness again it's not as though\nthere's something special about non-rem\nsleep that is proactively doing the\ncleansing faster than happens when we're\nawake it's just that the rate of\naccumulation when we're awake is greater\nthan the exceeding and exceeds the\ncapacity of the clearance so it builds\nup when we go into non-rem less\nmetabolically active it now the\nclearance exceeds the buildup and you're\nable to cleanse that debt I have two\nmore questions the first is about growth\nhormone so I was taught that growth\nhormone is released primarily in sleep\nalthough there are some daytime\nactivities that can promote the release\nof growth hormone as well certain forms\nof exercise maybe some thermal stimula\nEtc but that the\nmajor event of growth hormone release\noccurs in sleep is that true it is\nalthough it there is some argument that\nit is is it sleep dependent or is it\nsimply sleep coinciding okay meaning\nthat is it\nit's that at the time of day so is it a\ncadium process where it's just nighttime\nNur means that you release growth\nhormone or is it\nnighttime plus sleep that is needed and\nit seems to be a mixture of both but it\nseems to be more sleep dependent than it\nis\nnighttime dependent and sleep\nindependent I probably probably should\nhave said before growth hormone\ncritically important for growth of\nchildren during development but also for\ntissue repair and Metabolism throughout\nthe lifespan throughout the lifespan\nwhen we're adults we critically need it\nright so if I understand correctly when\none goes to sleep growth hormone is\nreleased but that there's a circadian\ncomponent as well so it's a bit of an\nand gate as they say which is that you\nneed this and that in order to get\ngrowth hormone release and the reason I\nask this uh and I'm going to frame it\nthis way because I think it's going to\nboth clarify what you said um and also\nlead to a practical uh step which is\nabout sleep regularity and timing I've\nheard that the growth hormone surge is\ngreatest at the beginning of the night\nof sleep and that if we go to sleep a\nfew hours later than usual we miss the\nopportunity to experience the same level\nof growth hormone release even if we\nsleep the same total number of hours\nright so um yet more incentive for uh\nregular sleep timing yes so you're right\nit's an and gate so it's night ESS does\nhelp but sleep helps perhaps\nsignificantly more meaning that I can\nhave you experience the nighttime but I\ncan deprive you of sleep and selectively\nof deep non-rem sleep and I can markedly\nimper your growth growth hormone release\nbut differently I think it tell me if\nthis is correct but differently if\nsomebody has to work the night shift and\nthey sleep during the day they'll still\nget a growth homeone release but not as\nmuch growth hormone release were they to\nhave slept at night correct so we can do\nit one of two ways so my way is to say I\nkeep you on a dial nocturnal sort of\nschedule where you're awake during the\nday and you asleep at night but I'm\ngoing to selectively deprive you of just\nyour deep sleep at night so you're still\nsleeping and you're still spending the\nnight ESS in bed which is not the shift\nwork version but I can block or not\nblock I can reduce significantly reduce\nyour growth hormone because I\nselectively deprived you of sleep or I\ncan do the opposite which is the shift\nwork approach which is I'm not going to\ndeprive you of sleep you're going to\nsleep during the day but now I have held\nsleep constant so in my version I have\nheld night ESS constant and I've\nmanipulated sleep in your version the\nshift worker we've done the opposite\nwe've held sleep constant they're\nsleeping during the day but we've\nmanipulated nighttime\nNess and now as you said yes they will\nrelease some growth hormone even though\nthat's not the natural time on the\n24-hour clock when we would see growth\nhormone released why because they are\ngetting sleep because it's a somewhat\nsleep dependent process but they're not\ngoing to necessarily release as much in\npart because they're not experiencing\nsleep at nighttime phases so you can you\ncan elegantly separate those two out and\nthat's why it's not quite one or the\nother but it seems to be both certainly\nit's sleep sensit I would say sleep\nsensitive is a very good way of\ndescribing it okay so translated to uh\nactionable protocol everyone should\nstrive to get uh sleep ideally at night\num of sufficient quality and quantity\nwhich you already discussed and getting\nsufficient amounts of deep sleep is\ngoing to be especially important for\nsake of growth hormone release correct\ngot\nit my my last question has to do with\nthe other end of the Sleep Cycle which\nis toward morning and waking which is\nthe hormone cortisol we hear so often\nthese days about cortisol and people\noften frame it as bad cortisol is bad\nyou hear this that is simply not true\nremove cortisol from an organism they\ndon't they will not do well right and um\nwe need cortisol uh for immune system\nfunction for waking for certain forms of\nmemory formation although too much\ncortisol is a Bad Thing\nindeed not enough cortisol is an equally\nbad thing indeed so um what is the\nrelationship between cortisol and\nemerging from sleep and put differently\nwhat is the relationship between deep\nsleep and cortisol meaning is sleep one\nway that we keep cortisol at Bay during\nstages of the 24-hour cycle when it\nwould be delerious to have elevated\ncortisol yes it is and that's one of I\nspoke about and we'll come on to this\nperhaps in when we speak about emotional\nand mental health\nand when we are\nunderslept we shift over into a more\nsort of activated sympathetic you know\nagitated state of our nervous system\nthat's that's one aspect of it but\nthere's another aspect of the stress\nresponse which is yes you get elevated\nheart rate you're more sympathetic which\nis this activated State rather than\nparasympathetic but you also get when\nyou're sleep deprived a greater release\nof the stress hormonal axis which is\ncalled the HPA axis which if you really\nwant to go to detail it's the\nhypothalamopituitary adrenal axis which\nis a fancy way of saying that it's a\nsignal from your brain going down to\nrelease cortisol so when you go into\ndeep sleep not only do you shift over\ninto the nice quiet rested quiescent\nstate of the nervous system but you also\nget a dissipation in that stress related\naxis and the relief of\ncortisol cortisol however seems to be\nalso under the strict control of your\nCadian Rhythm where it drops down at\nnight and in fact you have one of the\nthe steepest declines right at the\nmoment when you're starting to get\nsleepy too almost as though your brain\nand your body know we can't have\ncortisol even at sort of normative\nlevels that you would have during the\nday because otherwise this person is\njust going to still be a little bit too\nwired M this is the problem with a\nstressful event after say 8:00 P.M at\nnight if you see see something stressful\nexperience something stressful I mean\nthat um if it's stressful enough will\nspike your cortisol at that late hour\ncan really impede your entire sleep\nstructure it's a I would say it's one of\nthe things that I would advocate in\nterms of a good sleep optimized routine\nand we can come on to that and avoiding\nstress and arguments and TR and\ndisturbing news and things like that as\nmuch as as possible yeah um in the late\nevening and and early night hours even\nif you don't think you're necessarily\nsomeone who's sensitive to that now it\nturns out I am someone who is sensitive\nto that it can really quite trigger me\nso I stay away from it we often see this\nwith insomnia too and we call it the\ntired but wide phenomenon and people\nwill say to me look I am just so tired\nman I am so so tired but I'm just so\nwired that I can't fall asleep I'm\ndesperate for sleep I know I want sleep\nbut I can't fall asleep cuz I'm just so\nwide and that is a\nsympathetic hyper cortisol State and we\nyou can see it in their physiology but\ncoming back to your question cortisol\nwill drop naturally throughout the night\nbut then it starts to rise back up and\nwill start to produce its fantastic sort\nof peak climbing rate right at the\nmoment when you would naturally again\nwant to wake up so what we're mapping\nhere is this wonderful tapestry this\nKaleidoscope of coordinated\nbiology that your adenosine levels are\nfinally coming to their lowest point\nyour circadian rhythm is starting to\nrise your cortisol levels are starting\nto rise your core body temperature is\nstarting to increase because it's\ndropped throughout the night all of\nthese things unite in this beneficial\ntiming ballet of just brilliant\nthat naturally has you waking up and\nfeeling like you're ready to go if\neverything is aligned if you've got your\nchronotype right your sleep quantity\nyour quality regularity and your\nsleeping you know in appropriate sort of\ntimed amounts well your enchantment with\nsleep is indeed\ninfectious uh I've experienced it and I\nknow that everyone listening and\nwatching has experienced it as well as\nyou've taken us through this truly\nspectacular Voyage through this\nphenomenon that we call sleep I mean you\ninformed us about what sleep is what the\ndifferent sleep cycles are uh how they\nare structured and\ninterrelated U you talked to us about\nthe four macronutrients of good sleep\nquantity quality regularity and timing\nit's highly actionable information and\nthen of course some of the hormonal\nneurochemical uh interactions and\nconsequences of good sleep bad sleep for\nmental health physical health and\nperformance so first I'd like to just\nextend a giant thank you for taking
