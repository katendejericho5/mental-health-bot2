    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr EJ chelski\nDr EJ chelski is a professor of\nneurosurgery Opthalmology and\nNeuroscience at Stanford University he\nis one of the world's leading\nresearchers trying to understand how we\nsee the world around us that is how\nvisual perception occurs and then\napplying that information directly to\nthe design of neural prosthesis\nliterally robotic eyes that can allow\nblind people to see once again today's\ndiscussion is a very important one for\nanyone who wants to understand how their\nbrain works indeed EJ spells out in very\nclear terms exactly how the world around\nus is encoded by the neurons the nerve\ncells within our brain in order to\ncreate these elaborate visual images\nthat we essentially see within our minds\nand with that understanding he explains\nhow that can be applied to engineer\nspecific robotic Ai and machine learning\ndevices that can allow human brains not\nonly to see once again in the blind but\nalso to perceive things that typical\nhuman brains can't and indeed for memory\nto be enhanced and for cognition to be\nenhanced this is the direction that\nNeuroscience is going and in the course\nof today's discussion we have the\nopportunity to learn from the world\nWorld expert in these topics where the\nscience is now and where it is headed\nduring today's discussion we also get\nheavily into the topic of how to select\none's professional and personal path and\nindeed you'll learn from Dr chelski that\nhe has a somewhat unusual path both into\nscience and through science so for those\nof you that believe that everyone that's\nhighly accomplished in their career\nalways knew exactly what they wanted to\ndo at every stage you will soon learn\nthat that is absolutely not the case\nwith EJ he described\nwandering through three different\ngraduate programs taking several years\noff from school in order to dance Yes\nyou heard that correctly to dance and\nhow that wandering and indeed dancing\nhelped him decide exactly what he wanted\nto do with his professional life and\nexactly what specific problems to try\nand Tackle in the realm of Neuroscience\nand medicine it's a discussion that I'm\ncertain that everybody scientist or no\nyoung or old can benefit from and can\napply the specific tools that EJ\ndescribes in their own life and Pursuits\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\non this other podcast about the fact\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health health and\nperformance now one of the key aspects\nto getting a great night's sleep is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's because in order\nto fall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3Â° and in order to wake up in\nthe morning feeling refreshed your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees eight sleep makes\nit extremely easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nat the beginning middle and throughout\nthe night and when you wake up in the\nmorning I've been sleeping on an eight\nSleep mattress cover for nearly 3 years\nnow and it has dramatically improved my\nsleep if you'd like to try eights sleep\nyou can go to 8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $150 off their pod 3\ncover eight sleep currently ships to the\nUSA Canada UK select countries in the EU\nand Australia again that's 8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that are of the absolute\nhighest quality I've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology of the visual\nsystem and I can tell you that your\nvisual system has to contain with an\nenormous number of challenges in order\nfor you to be able to see clearly under\ndifferent conditions Roa understands\nthis and designed all of their\neyeglasses and sunglasses with the\nbiology of the visual system in mind now\nRoa eyeglasses and sunglasses were\ninitially developed for use in sport and\nas a consequence you can wear them\nwithout them slipping off your face\nwhile running or cycling and they're\nextremely lightweight Roa eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are also designed with a new\ntechnology called float fit which I\nreally like because it makes their\neyeglasses and sunglasses fit perfectly\nand they don't move around even when I'm\nactive so if I'm running and I'm wearing\nmy glasses they stay on my face most of\nthe time I don't even remember they're\non my face because they're so\nlightweight you can also use them while\ncycling or for other activities so if\nyou'd like to try Roa glasses go to

betterhelp offers\nProfessional Therapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out online now I've\nbeen going to therapy for well over 30\nyears initially I didn't have a choice\nit was a condition of being allowed to\nstay in school but pretty soon I\nrealized that therapy is extremely\nvaluable in fact I consider doing\nregular therapy just as important as\ngetting regular exercise including\ncardiovascular exercise and resistance\ntraining which of course I also do every\nweek the reason I know therapy is so\nvaluable is that if you can find a\ntherapist with whom you can develop a\nreally good rapport you not only get\nterrific support for some of the\nchallenges in your life but you also can\nderive tremendous insights from that\ntherapy insights that can allow you to\nbetter not just your emotional life and\nyour relationship life but of of course\nalso the relationship to yourself and to\nyour professional life to all sorts of\ncareer goals in fact I therapy is one of\nthe key components for meshing together\nall aspects of one's life and being able\nto really direct one's focus and\nattention toward what really matters if\nyou'd like to try betterhelp go

audience we are friends\nwe go way back EJ has been a few years\nor more ahead of me in the science game\nand the best way to describe you and\nyour work EJ is you're an astronaut you\ngo places no one else has been willing\nto go before he developed new\ntechnologies in order to do that all\nwith the Bold mission of trying to\nunderstand how the nervous system which\nof course includes the brain works and\nhow to make it better with engineering\nso today we are going to get into all of\nthat but just to start off and get\neverybody on the same page maybe we\ncould just take a moment and talk about\nthe brain and nervous system and you\nknow what it consists of that allows to\ndo all the sorts of things that we're\ngoing to get into like see things in our\nenvironment and respond to those things\nin our environment so at risk of\nthrowing too much at you right out the\ngate what's your one to five minute\nversion of how the brain\nworks oh I don't have a one to five\nminute version of how the brain works\nbut I can tell you how I think uh vision\nis initiated in the brain and\num you and I go back a long way so we\nhave a lot of common understanding about\nthis but I'll narrate it from scratch if\nif that makes\nsense um so vision is initiated in the\nretina uh of the eye which is a sheet\nneural tissue at the rear of the eye\nthat captures the light that is incident\non the eye that comes in through the\nthrough the eye transforms that light\ninto electrical signals processes those\nelectrical signals in interesting ways\nand changes them up and then sends that\nvisual information to the brain where it\nis used to bring about our sense of\nvision and uh you you asked me about the\n1 to five minute version how the brain\nworks I don't know but I do know that\nthe brain receives all these patterns of\nelectrical activity coming out of these\nnerve cells and the retina and somehow\nassembles that into our visual\nexperience whether that be responding to\nthings coming at us or our circadian\nrhythm\nthat that govern our sleep and behavior\nor identifying objects for prey or\navoiding Predators or appreciating\nBeauty and what we know is that the\nbrain receives a fantastically complex\nset of signals from the retina and puts\nthat all together into our visual\nexperience and we are very visual\ncreatures obviously so I think that's a\nbig part of how the brain works because\nso much of what we do revolves around\nvision revolves around how the brain\nputs together these signals coming out\nof the retina and I would love to\nunderstand how that works at the moment\nI don't uh and what we're trying to do\nis get a really complete understanding\nof how that begins in the retina and\nthen how we can restore it and those who\nhave lost\nsight why focus on this issue in the\nretina this thin set of layers of\nneurons that line the back of the eye\nwhat why why explore there I mean\nobviously there are centers within the\nbrain that of course contain neurons\nnerve cells that are involved in Vision\nif one wants to understand visual\nperception and I agree by the way that\nvisual perception is one of the most\ndominant forces in the quality and\nexperience of our\nlife why focus on the retina why not\nfocus on the visual cortex or the visual\nthalmus I me what's so special about the\nretina well we have to focus on all of\nit because understanding the retina\nwon't give us a full understanding of\nhow all this works obviously and if you\ndon't have your visual cortex and visual\nThalamus you won't see but if you don't\nhave your retina you also won't see you\nwon't even have a chance to see so I\nfocus on the retina because um I enjoy\nthe possibility that we can really\nunderstand a piece of the nervous system\nin my lifetime in our lifetimes we can\nunderstand it so well that we can build\nit replace it restore its function\nthat's farther off in this in the\ncentral regions of the brain it's going\nto be quite a bit harder um I find\nsatisfaction in really understanding\nsomething so well that I can write down\nin a mathematical formula what it's\ndoing that I can test my hypothesis up\nand down and yes we really get how this\nlittle machine works and that I can\nengineer devices to replace the function\nof that circuit when it's lost that to\nme is just deeply satisfying but there\nalso has is a really fundamental role\nfor people who want to go and do more\nexploratory work in the visual brain as\nyou mentioned in the visual cortex and\nthe phalus and other places because\nultimately those retinal signals won't\nlead to anything if those areas aren't\nputting it all together to govern our\nperception and our ultimately our\nBehavior so let's talk about the retina\nin its full Beauty and\ndetail three layers of cells line the\nback of the eye like a pie\ncrust somehow take light that comes into\nthe eye lens focuses that light if it\ndoesn't do that well we put lenses in\nfront of our eyes such as contact lenses\nor\nspectacles and somehow takes that light\nand transforms it as you said into\nneural signals and processes that within\nthe retina so let's take a deep dive\ninto the retina and do so with the\nunderstanding at least my understanding\nis that\nin part thanks to your work and the work\nof others this is perhaps the best\nunderstood piece of the brain yes I\nthink it's a solid argument that it's\nthe best understood piece of the brain\nand uh we'll turn back to that in a\nminute so um the retina begins with a\nsheet of cells called the photo receptor\ncells that are highly specialized these\nare cells that essentially don't exist\nanywhere else in the brain and what they\ndo is transform light energy into\nelectrical signals in neurons very\nspecialized very uh demanding cells they\nrequire a lot of Maintenance and they\ndie relatively easily which is what\ngives rise to some some of the forms of\nblindness those are the you might call\nthem pixel detectors they're tiny cells\ncalled photo receptors that each one\ncaptures light from a particular\nlocation in the\nworld that sheet of cells has done that\ninitial transduction process where light\nis converted into neural signals that\nthe brain can then begin to work with\nthe second layer is responsible\nfor processing adjusting changing mixing\nand matching uh comparing signals and\ndifferent neurons many complex\noperations that we're still trying to\nunderstand and consists of dozens of\ndistinct cell types that extract\nfeatures if you will of the visual World\nfrom the elementary pixels represented\nin the photo receptor cells so that\nsecond layer is receiving the input from\nthat sheet of photo receptors and\npicking stuff out of\nit the third layer of cells is the\nso-called retinol gangan cells that's\nthe only uh term that I'd like to\nprobably will come up repeatedly in this\nconversation uh so for your for your\nviewers and listeners um these retinol\nganglin cells are the ones who are\nresponsible for taking the signals that\nare there in the retina and sending them\nto the brain so that the process of\nvision can begin they are the The\nMessengers if you will from the retina\nto the brain the retinal ganglin cells\nand there are about 20 different types\nin humans um are again feature\nextractors they pick out different bits\nand pieces of the visual scene and send\ninteresting stuff to the brain trying to\nleave out the uninteresting stuff and\nthe 20 or so cell types all pick out\ndifferent types of information from the\nvisual scene you can sort of think of\nthem as Photoshop filters each cell type\nin the retina um again about 20\ndifferent gangin cell types each type\nrepresents the full scene the entire\nvisual world but picks out different\nfeatures such as some cells pick out\nspatial detail tiny little Points of\nLight almost some cells pick out and\nSignal information about things that are\nmoving in the visual World some cells\npick out information that's been\ncaptured about different wavelengths\nfrom the photo receptor cells and there\nthereby giving us our sensations of\ncolor and probably more things in those\n20 different gangin cell types that we\ndon't fully\nunderstand the result then is that the\nretina has this sort of a representation\nof the visual world but it has 20\ndifferent representations not one it's\nnot one picture that comes out of the\nretina and gets sent to the brain no no\nno it's 20 different pictures and you\ncan think of maybe as 20 different\nphotoshopped pictures but one of them\nhas the edges highlighted one of them\nhas the colors highlighted one of them\nhas movement uh encoded in it and these\nsomehow these filters send the\ninformation to many different targets in\nthe brain and our brain puts it off Al\ntogether and then we have a cohesive\nsense of the visual World which is the\nremarkable feature that we really don't\nunderstand\namazing is it fair for those that don't\nwork with Photoshop to think about these\num different Photoshop filters perhaps\nas like different movies of the visual\nworld one movie contains the outlines of\nobjects and people and things another\nmovie is showing the motion of blobs in\nthe environment meaning whatever is\nmoving environment is kind of just\nrepresented as blobs another movie is\njust the color in the environment\nanother and then all of those what I'm\ncalling movies are sent into the brain\nand then the brain somehow combines\nthose in ways that allow us to see each\nother and see cars and objects and\nrecognize faces is that is that one way\nto think about that that's exactly how I\nthink about it maybe it's a better way\nto say it no I I I like the Photoshop\nfilter uh analogy I just for those that\ndon't work with Photoshop um you know I\nI just think that the movie analogy\nmight might be a decent alternative how\nthe retina works is an example we think\nof how all sensory systems work there's\nan initial representation in a\nspecialized cell type that is it is that\nis responsible for and capable of\nextracting physical features from the\nworld and then neural circuits in the\nbrain use that information in different\nways to grab stuff out of the visual\nworld in the auditory system there's the\nthe sound world is represented also in\nspecialized cells that capture sound\nenergy and transduce that into neural\nsignals and then subsequent p uh stages\nof processing in the auditory system\npick out different features of our\nauditory world like the frequency how\nhigh or how low a tone is right the\ndirection it's coming from right the\nmovement of it uh how loud it is\ndifferent features are extracted so the\nwe think the visual system is just an\nexample of how the external world is\nrepresented in our brain and of course\nin some sense a a philosophical approach\nto the brain is really saying well\nthere's the sensory world and then\nthere's the actions we take and there's\nalmost nothing else that we really know\nother than those two things how the\nsensory world comes in and then finally\nit results in our action that's what our\nbrain is about because vision is so\nimportant for people I find it\nabsolutely compelling and fascinating I\nmean as an example as you know well many\npeople study rodents\nuh to understand how different aspects\nof the brain work and um you know\nrodents are interesting animals and do\nall sorts of really cool things but they\ninteract with the world differently than\nwe do they in in a lot of ways they\nsense by smelling they they identify\nobjects by smelling and they navigate\nwith their whiskers in to a large extent\nwe don't do any of that you don't\nnavigate with your whiskers at least I\ndon't think you do you don't recognize\nme when I walk in the room by my smell\nno you use for all that and we humans\nuse Vision so it's a really fundamental\naspect of who we are as biological\ncreatures I wonder if just for sake of\nentertainment uh we could think about\nhow the human retina and therefore\nVision in our species differs a little\nbit from some extreme examples of vision\nin other species not to make this a\ncomparative um or Zoological um\nexploration but just to really\nillustrate the fact that the specific\ncell types within our\nretinas create a visual representation\nof the outside world that can be and\noften is very different from that of\nother species um for instance or at\nleast my understanding is that the\nmantis shrimp sees I don't know 60 to\n100 different variations of each color\nthat we are essentially blind to because\ntheir photoreceptors can detect very\nsubtle differences in red for instance\nlong wavelengths of light what most\npeople refer to as red um pit vipers\ncons sense heat\nemissions essentially with their eyes\nbut also other organs um and on and on\nyou know it I raise this because I think\nthe the human neuro retina is such an\nincredible example of extracting\nfeatures from the visual world that then\nwe recreate but I think it's also worth\nreminding everyone and ourselves that\nit's not a complete representation of\nwhat's out there like there's a lot in\nlight that we don't see because our\nneuro retina just can't turn it into\nelectrical signals right you want to\ngive some examples of what we can't see\nand if any um particular examples from\nthe Animal Kingdom Delight you feel free\nto throw those out well one thing you\nmentioned color um we experience a rich\nsensation of color when we look at the\nworld and say wow I see all these colors\nthat's immediate\nand that's just how we talk about it but\nin fact we have very little information\nabout color color is a very\nhigh-dimensional complex thing or\nwavelength I should say wavelength\ninformation really is about how much\nenergy there is in the light around us\nat different wavelengths we only have\nthree sort of snapshots of that in our\nretinas with the three different types\nof photo receptor cells that are\nsensitive to different wavelength\ndifferent bands of the wavelength\nSpectrum three is not a lot as you just\nsaid other creatures have many more ways\nof capturing wavelength information and\none way you can verify for yourself that\nwe just have three is to realize that if\nyou look at your TV there are only three\nprimaries on your TV there's a red\nthere's a green and there's a blue\nthat's it and from those three primaries\nthe entire richness of the experience on\nyour TV set is uh composed so with just\nthose three things you basically are\nable to create any human visual\nsensation well the mantis shrimp would\nbe like that's nothing there's so much\nmore stuff out there that's not\nrepresented on this TV if you could\nspeak to the mantis shrimp another thing\nwe we maybe don't see another example of\na difference in the animal kingdom is so\num again taking rodents as an example\none of the one of the things rodents\nhave to do is to not be hunted by birds\nthat are coming down toward them\nand so it it appears that there are\ncells in the retina that\nare seem to be quite sensitive to what\nto uh looming to something dark that's\ngetting bigger uh like a shadow coming\nfrom a bird coming down at you we don't\nknow for sure that this is exactly what\ncauses animals to avoid being eaten by\nbirds but there's there's interesting\nevidence in that direction that's not\nreally a big thing for us for humans as\nfar as I know we're not typically hunted\nby huge birds so that's not a thing we\nneed and I think that's that's where\ncomes back to where you were headed if I\nunderstand right um which is we occupy\ndifferent biological niches we and the\nManta shrimp and the rodents and our\nvisual systems reflect that we have\ndifferent stuff that we're looking for\nin our visual environment than other\ncreatures are and so our eyes are\ndifferent and that's one of the reasons\nthat we emphasize work on the human\nretina um as opposed to other certain\nother animal species that would be less\nclearly relevant to the visual\nexperience you and I have so let's talk\nabout these incredible experiments that\nyour laboratory has been doing for\nseveral decades now I've had the uh\nprivilege of sitting in on some of these\nexperiments and they are very involved\num to say the least if you could just\nwalk us through one of these experiments\nI think the audience would appreciate\nunderstanding what goes into quote\nunquote trying to understand what's\ngoing on in the electrical activity of\nthese specific retinal cell types the\nretinal gangling cells in particular um\nyou know what does this look like you\nknow you're in your laboratory at\nStanford and you get a phone call\nsomeone says I got a retina what happens\nnext we scramble like crazy we drop\neverything we're doing cancel all our\nappointments and get ourselves ready for\n48 hours of non-stop work down in the\nlab getting as much data as we possibly\ncan from the retina the most exciting\nexample of what you just said is when we\nget a human retina when for example\nthere's a a donor who has died and the\nretina is available for research we jump\nat that opportunity how soon after uh\nthe person is deceased do you need to\nget the eye Globe the eyeball in order\nto get the retina in a condition that\nwould allow you to record electrical\nsignals from it a few minutes just\nyou're waiting in the hospital um typic\nthe way we typically get these eyes is\nfrom brain dead individuals so people\nwho are legally and medically dead but\nthey're hearts are still pumping and\ntherefore their retinas are still alive\nand functioning when when those\nindividuals uh are used their the bodies\nof those individuals are used for organ\ndonations we can benefit from that organ\ndonation setup that organ distribution\ncenters do to save many people's lives\nand also to promote research so we\nsometimes get those retinas and that\nbegins the experiment for us um I'm\ngonna ask for a few more details here\njust to put the picture in people's\nminds and not to be gruesome I just\nreally want people to understand what's\ninvolved here so you'll get a call we've\ngot a a patient who is soon to be\ndeceased um they've consented to giving\ntheir eye Globes their eyeballs for\nresearch so that you can study the human\nretina y um is it you who goes over and\ntakes the eyes out does somebody do that\nor hand them to you in a bucket of ice\nI'm sorry if I'm making people queasy at\nall but th this is folks how uh one goes\nabout trying to understand understand\nhow the human brain works absolutely and\nthis is also how you go about donating\nyour heart so that you can save somebody\nelse's life who needs a heart transplant\nthe same incredible organizations that\ndo the harvesting of the tissue for us\ntheir primary goal is to do that for\norgan donations to save lives they save\nlives every day these people are\nincredible donor Network West is one of\nthose organizations the one that we work\nwith um they're really amazing um so\ntheir technicians or a retinal surgeon\nwill take the eye out give it to myself\nor some somebody from my lab who will\nbring it back to the lab and we have a\nway to keep the eye alive and\nfunctioning just the eye by itself is\nthis always at Stanford or do you\nsometimes travel elsewhere local\nhospitals up to an hour away so then you\ndrive them back we drive them back it's\nthe retina Express and when when we're\nbringing back the retin Express it's uh\nagain it's all hands on deck in our lab\nwe are scrambling setting up all of our\nequipment getting everything ready\nyou've been at these experiments they're\nintense and they really are really are\n48 hour marathons of incredible activity\nby really dedicated individuals so um we\nwe might get those eyes sometimes we get\nthem at 2 in the morning that's common\nand from that to in the morning time um\nBegins the experiment so we bring the\neyes back we open them up and we we have\naccess to the rear of the eye which is\nwhat the where the retina is it's a thin\nsheet of neural tissue at the back part\nof the eye we hemis the eye cut it in\nhalf so that we can see the back it's\nlike half of a glow if you will and then\nwe put in relaxing cuts and lay it out\nflat so we can see what we're working\nwith then we take little segments of\nretina out in the subsequent 48 Hours\ncut them out maybe a 3X3 millimeter\npiece of the retina a little chunk of\nretinal tissue and bring it into an\nelectrophysiology recording and\nstimulation apparatus that allow allows\nus to interact with it and we do two\ntypes of experiments with that so this\nelectrophysiological recording and\nstimulation apparatus is very custom\nbuilt by our physics collaborator who\nhave developed high-end equipment it\nallows us to record and stimulate\nthrough 512 channels simultaneously at\nvery high density this is pretty\nhigh-end stuff in terms of uh technology\nfor interrogating and manipulating the\nelectrical signals in the retina that's\nwhat we specialize in in my lab could I\njust ask a question about this device um\nI've seen it before uh it's very small\nas you mentioned your recording from a\nfew millimet square of the of the retina\num from this recently deceased patient\num it looks a little bit like a bed of\nnails right like tiny little microwires\nall arranged very Clos to one another\nyou got the retina laying down on top of\nit and that bed of nails can extract\nmeaning record the electrical signals\nthat are coming out of the retinal\ngangion cells that's right and the\nretina is still alive so you are in a\nposition to shine light on it and\nessentially um make it behave um um in\nthe same way it would if it were still\nlining the back of a healthy alive\nperson that is the beauty of these\nexperiments so because we can keep the\nretina alive and happy and because the\nretinal ganglin cells the cells that are\nthe ones that message the visual\ninformation to the brain are on the\nsurface we can put them right next to\nthe electrodes and we can record their\nelectrical activity in other words we\nrecord the signal that those cells would\nhave sent to the brain if they were\nstill in the living person and at the\nsame time as you said we can focus an\nimage that we create on a computer\ndisplay onto the retina so we're\ntreating the retina if you will as a\nlittle electronic circuit which it\nalmost is honestly delivering light to\nthe photo receptor cells so that they\nare electrically excited and then\nrecording the electrical activity that\nthe retina is sending out if you will\nthat allows us to study how the retina\nWorks\nnormally what we also do with that same\nelectrical apparatus is turn around and\npass current through those electrodes in\norder to see if we can activate those\nganglin cells directly with no light\njust electrodes why do we do that we do\nthat because it allows us to design\nfuture methods of restoring Vision by\nelectrical stimulation of the retina\nwhich we'll probably talk about in a few\nminutes I'd like to take a brief moment\nand thank one of our sponsors and that's\nag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that also contains adaptogens I\nstarted taking ag1 way back in 2012 the\nreason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day is that\nit ensures that I meet all of my quotas\nfor vitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman let's take this moment to talk\na little bit about cell types so um you\nmentioned there are about 20 different\ntypes of these retinal gangling cells\nwhat we may refer to in brief as r gc's\nso retinal gangling cells rgc's same\nthing\nand as you mentioned these cover the\nentire retina so that if each cell type\nis extracting a different set of\nfeatures from the visual World motion\ncolor specific colors\nEtc that essentially no location in the\nworld around us fails to be represented\nby these cells put differently these\ncells are looking everywhere um each\ncell\ncell type is looking everywhere um so\nthat if movement occurs in any region of\nour visual world we are in a position to\ndetect it um but maybe we could talk a\nlittle bit about cell types cell types\nis such an important theme in the field\nof Neuroscience and indeed in all of\nbiology but it's actually not something\nwe have talked about very much on this\npodcast before either in Solo episodes\nor in guest episodes um I don't have any\nspecific reason for that we've talked\nabout brain areas prefrontal cortex\nbasil ganglia anterior mingal cortex and\non and on we' talked about neural\ncircuits but we've never really talked\nabout cell types so the gangan cells as\nother you let me down no talking about\ncell types well but that's why you're\nhere that's why I'm here that's why\nyou're here um tell us about cell types\nhow do you figure\nout if you have a cell type how do you\nknow if it's a cell type or you know is\nit the shape is it how it responds um\nhow do you know if you have a cell type\nwhat what's this about and I want to\njust um put in the back of this question\num or rather in the back of people's\nminds that um this issue of cell types\nis not just an issue pertinent to the\nretina this is an issue that is critical\nto understanding how the brain works\nabsolutely it's critical to understand\nConsciousness I know a lot of people\nlike what is consciousness right we're\nnot going there just yet but uh what are\ncell types how do you determine if you\nhave a cell type and why is this so\nimportant to understanding how the brain\nworks yeah I mean as as you said as as\nfar as we understand every single brain\ncircuit is full of very distinct cell\ntypes those cell types are distinguished\nby their genetic expression their shapes\nand sizes which other cells they do\ncontact and which cells they don't\ncontact where they send their\ninformation to in other parts of the\nbrain and what they represent and as far\nas we know this is true throughout the\nbrain and it's true in the retina the\ndifferent gangling cell types retinal\nganglin cell types about 20 of them Each\nof which is looking at the whole visual\nscene extracts different stuff this cell\ntype one extracts one thing cell type\ntwo extracts something else but they all\nrepresent the entire visual scene but\nthose cell types we know from lots of\nbeautiful work work that you're closely\nconnected to and some of which you've\ndone um those cell types have different\nmorphology different shapes and sizes\ndifferent patterns of gene expression\ndifferent targets in the brain they send\ntheir outputs to different places in the\nbrain so really to study the retina\nwithout understanding cell types you're\nkind of lost right away you have to know\nwhat's going on with the cell types\notherwise you can't make sense of this\nretinol signal the way we we identify\nthem in two ways and they're different\nfor different purposes the the basic way\nwe identify the different cell types is\ntheir function because we study their\nfunction we study how they respond to\nlight images and we can clearly separate\nthem out and in fact it's it's a simple\nthing to say but it's really true our\n512 electrod technology which you've\nseen in our lab and stuff that developed\nwith collaborators um about 20 years ago\num was crucial for this because with\nthat 512 electrode technology we could\nsee many cells of each type and we could\nclearly parse them apart from one\nanother whereas previous studies working\non one cell at a time had great\ndifficulty doing that so with our\ntechnology with 512 electrodes we record\nhundreds of cells simultaneously we say\noh there's 20 of these there are 50 of\nthose there's 26 of those and here they\nare and we can just set them in\ndifferent bins and say okay this is\nwhat's present in this retina just what\nthe information is they're\nextracting there's another purpose again\nreferring forward to the\nneuroengineering aspect we need to\nidentify the cell types not just based\non what visual information they carry\nbut based on their electrical features\nproperties electrical properties of the\ncells cells as you know neurons are\nelectrical cells they fundamentally\nreceive and transmit electrical\ninformation and the way that they do\nthat has a distinctive electrical\nsignature that turns out to be super\nimportant for developing devices to to\nrestore\nVision could you explain how you\ndetermine what a given cell type does\nits electrical properties um let's just\ndraw a mental image for people uh the\nretina's taken out of this deceased\nindividual put down on this bed of nails\nof electrodes those electrodes can\ndetect electrical signals within the\ngangling cells you are able to shine\nlight onto the retina and see how the\nretinal gangling cells respond meaning\nwhat electrical signals they would\ntransmit to the brain if they were still\nconnected to a brain they're not\nconnected to a brain in the experiment\nthey're sitting there they're trying but\nthey're\ntrying I could imagine playing those\ncells a movie of I don't know a\ncheckerboard going where every um Square\non the checkerboard goes from white to\nblack to gray could do that I could um\nplay a\ncartoon I could um show it uh this\nyear's Academy Award winner for best\npicture like how do you decide what to\nshow the retina this is a human being's\nretina after all uh presumably it looked\nat things that are relevant to human\nbeings until that person died but how do\nyou determine cell type electrical\nsignals if you don't know what specific\nthings to show it I mean you're going to\nshow it I don't know Disney movies like\nwhat what do you show\nit\nso what we shown now reflects the fact\nthat we've built up a lot of information\nand our work stands on the shoulders of\nmany scientists who have studied the\nretina for decades to figure out what\ndifferent cell types respond to and um\nwe know that certain cell types respond\nprimarily to increments of light when\nlight gets brighter than it was so a\nchange from a certain brightness to a\nhigher brightness this particular cell\ntype fires another cell type fires or\nsend spikes to the brain when it gets\ndarker some cell types uh respond\nprimarily to large Targets in the visual\nWorld other cell types respond better to\nsmall Targets in the visual\nWorld some cell types respond to\ndifferent wavelengths of light that we\ncan identify there exist certain cell\ntypes that are still poorly understood\nthat respond to movement so we can\ntailor visual stimuli to types that we\nkind of already know about because of\nmuch preceding\nresearch that's not actually how we do\nit in our experiments for the most part\ninstead we use a very unbiased\nflickering checkerboard pattern as it\nturns out which is a really efficient\nunbiased way to sample many cells\nsimultaneously so that in a half hour of\nelectrical recording from a retina we\ncan figure out what all the 512 or so\ncells are that we're recording and know\nall of their types and the way we do\nthat is to play essentially random\ngarbage TV snow Type image to the retina\nfor a period of time and determine which\nbits of of brightening or darkening or\nmovement or whatever in that random\ngarbage activated this particular cell\nby looking AC at average across the half\nhour recording and saying oh it looks\nlike this cell was always firing when it\nbecame bright in this region of the\nscreen that must be an on Cell sensitive\nto light in this region of the screen\nand so on so we have sophisticated\nefficient ways of doing it but it all\ncomes back to these basic things about\nwhat features in the visual World tend\nto cause a given cell to send a signal\nto the bra yeah that makes a lot of\nsense so you take essentially what you\ncalled random garbage um snow white\nblack and gray pixels on a\nscreen yep the retina views that and\nthen the cells in the retina will\nrespond every once in a while with an\nelectrical potential they'll fire as we\nsay spike it's sometimes called and then\nyou take sort of a forensic\napproach a bit later you look back in\ntime and you say you know what was the\narrangement of pixels in this random\ngarbage right before this\ncell fired an electrical potential\nthat's right a spike and then from that\nyou can reconstruct the preferred\nstimulus yeah right the you can say oh\nthis cell and cells around it seem to\nlike motion of things going in a\nparticular direction for instance and um\nhow do you know know that the cell\ndoesn't also like a bunch of other stuff\nthat you\ndidn't pick up on using\nthis random garbage yeah two things for\nlet let me just say for the record we\ndon't record from these cells that\nsignal Motion in particular directions\nthey are an elusive cell type that is\nbest understood in rodents and other\ncreatures and not well understood in the\nprimate as you know although some people\nare discovering potential cells of that\ntype now and have have recently\ndiscovered them okay so let's say cells\nthat respond\nto like spots that are red um you know\nthat go from dim red to bright red right\nyeah so we can go through that colored\nTV snow and pick out the cells that\nresponded to a transition of the kind\nyou described from darker to lighter or\nfrom Greener to redder or something like\nthat cells tend to respond to\nTransitions in the visual scene rather\nthan static\nimagery um and so we can pick that stuff\nout but you asked the question will G is\nthe TV snow G to capture everything\nabout what these cells are doing that's\na really important question that I want\nto just mention more um quite likely not\nthat's a scientific instrument it's an\nunbiased way to sample a whole bunch of\ncells you know first cut look at you\nknow generally speaking what are they up\nto but that doesn't mean we've really\ncaptured their role in natural visual\nperception because actually you don't go\nthrough the World perceiving visual snow\nyou go through the world perceiving\nobjects and meals and mates and targets\nand all these things right so the study\nof how the retina responds to more\nnaturalistic visual stimuli uh in my lab\nand in many La other labs around the\nworld is really get getting off the\nground now and I would say we have\nlimited understanding um I would say we\nknow that our simple laboratory\nexperiments with the TV snow don't\ncapture the whole story there's more\nthere're about 20 different cell types\nin the retina we have basic\ncharacterizations of seven of them if\nyou count a certain way um we know that\nthere are another 15 or so lurking right\nbehind the curtain that we've started to\nsample we don't know what naturalistic\ntargets they respond to in the visual\nlife of the animal that's work that's\nunderway exciting interesting work\nbecause this we know that the r they got\nto be there for something one one way to\nthink of it I'm I'm pretty sure you\nthink think of it this way too is that\nthe retina is a highly evolved organ\nwith a lot of evolutionary pressure for\nit to be efficient to have a small optic\nnerve sending to the brain it's probably\nthe case that there's no accidental\nstuff sitting around in the retina\nthat's visal and sending information to\nthe brain it's probably the case that\nthis those signals are are all doing\nsomething important for our visual\nbehavior for our well-being for our\nsleep all sorts of stuff and I think and\nthe field is still trying to figure that\nout these these are the big Mysteries I\nthink that in terms of the retina what\nare those signals exactly in all those\ndifferent cell types what different\nbehaviors and aspects of our life do\nthey\ncontrol what is the wildest cell type\nyou've ever\nencountered like what did it do like\nwhat did it respond to that's that's\nwhat I mean when I say wildest um you\nknow it cells reog gangling cells that\nrespond to you know increasingly red\nportions of the visual scene or\ndecreasingly green portions of the\nvisual scene like okay cool that seems\ncool like get some you know around the\ntime of Christmas that that's useful and\nit's uh useful on other days of the year\nas well but you know given that the\nretina is indeed the best understood\npiece of the brain and given that you\nhave 20 cell types 20 isn't 20 million\nit's um you know it seems tractable\nprobably gets understanding it in its\nentirety or understanding them in their\nentirety excuse me um one would like to\nknow like what what stuff is are we\npaying attention to at the level of the\nretina I mean are there like Spiral\nsells it like Spiral stuff in the\nenvironment are there sells it like\nemojis like what what's going on in\nthere you spent a lot of time doing this\nwe do we SP a lot after all you give up\ntwo nights sleep which is kind of\nincredible by the way I'll just do a\nlittle uh take a moment here and just\nsay you know for a guy that's been doing\nthis for this long with these sleepless\nnights um you look pretty good you look\npretty resty\nyou I tend to go home I go home before\nThe Graduate students do oh they stay up\nthey stay up I was used to stay up I\nused to stay up until my mid 40s I was I\nwas in there doing the all nighter type\nthings got it and um maybe you can help\nme figure out my sleep patterns better\nyeah yeah we can talk about that this\nepisode we talk about how to pull all\nnighters and still survive done plenty\nof those um but yeah like what's yeah\nlots at stake here there's a human\nretina you know meaning a human gave up\ntheir eyeballs to for this experiment\nafter they died of\nyou got many people this these are these\nsort of experiments um are very\nexpensive um a lot of fancy equipment a\nlot of salaries to try and figure this\nstuff out this is the chief mission of\nthe national eye institute there's a lot\nof tax dollars like this is um in my\nopinion as important as the Space\nProgram probably more important in my\nopinion you know restoring Vision to the\nblind obviously so what are you finding\nin there yeah and and we have the\nprivilege of being on the front lines of\nthat funded by the National Institute\nand other in tions to be out there\nfiguring out what's going on in this\nhuman retina I'm with you on that so I\nI'll tell you how we go B it these days\nthere are about seven cell types that we\nunderstand pretty well what they're\ndoing they're it's not they're not\ncomplicated they just have different\nproperties color size this kind of thing\ntemporal properties their timing of\ntheir signals and those seven cell types\nwe understand pretty well but we're\ntrying to really nail down the details\nwhy because of neuroengineering for\nvision\nrestoration then there's another I'm\ngoing to say 15 or so and we and the\nanatomists the people who study the\nshapes and sizes of the cells have long\nknown that there were more cell types\nlurking in the retinal circuitry but\ntheir function has not been known and\nbecause we didn't have many recordings\nfrom them we didn't have electrical\nrecordings in response to light that\nwould tell us what they naturally do\nwe've actually had a breakthrough in the\nlast few years led by a senior research\nin my in my lab named Alexander cing who\nhas figured out that there's another 15\nor so cell types lurking in those\nrecordings that if we look more\ncarefully they're there and they have\ncrazy properties and so the crazy\nproperties I can tell you about have to\ndo with the spatial region of the visual\nworld that they respond to the\nwell-known cell types that you know and\nI know from the textbooks kind of\nrespond to a circular spot in the visual\nworld if there's light in this little\ncircular area they'll fire a spike if\nthere's no light there they don't care\nwell okay some cells is not quite\ncircular some cells respond to the light\nthat's there and and the difference from\nthe light that's around it so if it's\nbrighter than the light that's nearby\nthen you then you get a big response the\nnew cell types are more puzzling than\nthat some of them respond to three or\nfour blobs in the visual world that's\nkind of strange unexpected definitely\nunexpected based on the textbooks and\nthe newest ones are weirder yet some of\nthem they're their visual response\nprofiles that is the region of the\nvisual world that they are sensitive to\nlight\nin almost has a spidery shape almost\nlike the dendrites of a cell like the\nprocesses of a cell and some of them\nhave Blobby Light sensitivity they're\nsensitive to to light increments here\nand decrements there and increments here\nand decrements there and some blue light\nover here and blue light over here we\ndon't understand these cells to be clear\nthe seven that we understand reasonably\nwell well and not trying to just pin\ndown and really nail for vision\nrestoration the sort of first cut at at\ncell type specific Vision\nrestoration those ones don't have these\nweird properties they're a little\nsimpler to understand so we're we're\njust but we're just working out all the\ndetails of the timing of the of the\nresponses and all that these new ones we\ndon't know what's going on with them so\nwe're doing experiments those seven cell\ntypes constitute maybe\n70% of all the neurons that send visual\ninformation from the eye to the brain so\nwe think it's a really solid Target for\nVision restoration to work with the\nsimple\nones and so so when I when I say that I\nthink that the retina is the best\nunderstood circuit in the nervous system\nI'm talking about those seven cell types\nwhich we know a lot about what they do\nwe really do know a lot it's not done\nbut we know a lot I'm not talking about\nthe other 15 cell types which are a\nminority of the population but seem to\nbe doing very strange and surprising\nthings that are yet to be determined so\nthere it's a mix we know some really\ngood stuff and then there's really some\ndeep Mysteries out there about these\nother cell types so we've been talking a\nlot about how to understand the signals\nthat the retina is sending the brain and\nI know your lab has done incredible work\nin this Arena and figured out a number\nof the different signals as you\ndescribed some of the features that the\ndifferent cell types are extracting just\na moment ago these Blobs of different\ncolors\nEtc what good is this to you know the\neveryday person right um What What In\naddition to wanting to understand how we\nsee you know what sort of sorts of\nmedical applications can this provide in\nterms of potentially restoring Vision to\nthe blind um but perhaps even larger\ntheme is this notion of neuroengineering\nright taking this information and\ncreating devices that can help us help\nour nervous system function better maybe\neven function at superphysiological\nlevels I know there's a lot of interest\nin this these days um in part due to\nneural link right because elon's out\nthere front-facing very vocal about his\nvision of the no pun intended of you\nknow chips being implanted in people's\nbrains that would allow them to be in\nconversation with you know 100 people at\nthe same time just by hearing those\nvoices in the head maybe filtering\nthings out so it doesn't sound like a\nclamor of a hundred different voices um\nperhaps giving people super memory I\nmean you know sky the limit no no one\nreally knows where this is all headed\nyou're working in what we call a very\nstrain system where it has specific\nproperties that you're trying to\nunderstand and once you understand those\nyou can start to think about real\napplications of like what's possible\nlike could you create a visual system\nthat um Can extract more color features\nfrom the world that no other human can\nsee um can you restore um pattern Vision\nto somebody who is essentially blind\nindependent on a cane or a dog or you\nknow God forbid can't even leave their\nhouse because they can't see anything at\nall you know where is this headed what\nis the information useful for and\nperhaps we should frame that first\nwithin the medical rehabilitative\ncontext of repairing uh or restoring\nVision rather and then get into the more\nkind of um uh sci-fi type\nneuroengineering stuff absolutely yeah\nthis this really is my passion these\ndays turning that corner continuing to\nfigure out the mysteries in the retina\nbut also saying wait a second we\nactually know quite a lot about this\nshouldn't this be the first place that\nwe can solve problems like restoring\nVision restoring function or augmenting\nour function I think it should be the\nconcept of how to do this is\nstraightforward and not invented by us\nin any way and that is the following one\nof the major sources of blindness in uh\nthe Western world is uh loss of the\nphoto receptor cells that capture light\nmacular degeneration and retinitis\nPigmentosa are two well-known ailments\nthat give rise to to vision loss and the\nvision loss is because the cells that\ncapture light in the first place that we\ntalked about earlier die off so you're\nno longer sensitive to light and then\nyou're blind the concept is that you may\nbe able to bypass those early sections\nof the retina that capture the light and\nprocess the signals and\ninstead build an electronic implant that\nconnects up directly to the retinal\nganglin cells and this electronic\nimplant would would do the following it\nwould capture the light using a camera\nwhich is relatively easy it would\nprocess the visual information in a\nmanner similar to the way that the\nretina normally does as similar as\npossible and then it would electrically\nactivate the retinal gangin cells by\npassing current and causing the gangin\ncells to fire spikes and send those\nspikes to the brain and if we do this\nreally well we can essentially replace\nthose first two layers of the retina and\npiggy back onto the third layer and say\nokay we're just jumping right into that\nthird layer we're going to force those\nganglin cells to send reasonable visual\nsignals to the brain and then the brain\nis going to think it got a natural\nvisual signal and proceed accordingly\nthat's the concept this is not our idea\npeople have had this concept for decades\nand some people have even started to\nmake it work in in human patients and\nwhat I mean by that is implanting\nelectrodes on the retina stimulating and\ncausing people who've been profoundly\nblind for decades to see visual\nsensation blobs and streaks of light in\ntheir visual world that that are\nreproducible so so that's happening now\nthat's happened people who were at once\nblind yep are able to see objects are\nable to see crude blobs and flashes of\nlight in ways that allow them to\nnavigate their world better a little bit\na little bit avoid a coffee table maybe\nor at least see a bright window in a\ndark wall and be able to point to that\nbright window or the bright doorway in a\ndark wall something like that so it's a\nglass half full half empty story that I\nwant to turn that I'd like to turn\nattention to in this conversation cuz I\nI think it's very exciting um yes you\ncan see stuff by artificially\nelectrically stimulating the ganglin\ncells and you can see stuff that\nactually helps you interact with your\nworld a tiny little bit so great that's\nthe glass half full the glass half empty\nis it's nothing remotely resembling what\nwe understand as naturalistic Vision\nwhere we see spine spatial detail and\ncolor and objects and can navigate\ncomplex environments and all that stuff\nno chance you can't do anything REM\nremotely like that you can see that\nthere's a bright doorway over that way\nand turn toward it which is a helpful\nstep in your Human Experience but\nthere's a long way to go so the question\nis why does this existing technology\nfail to give us high quality Vision what\nwhat's needed to give us high quality\nvision and this is the piece I'm really\npassionate\nabout it turns out that the the devices\nthat have been implanted in humans so\nfar by pioneering bioengineers who did\nreally hard stuff were were fairly\nsimple devices that treated the retina\nas if it's a camera that is just a grid\nof pixels and they put a grid of\nelectrodes down there and they\nstimulated it according to the pixels in\nthe visual world and thought well\nhopefully that will cause the retina to\ndo the right thing and send a nice\nvisual piece of visual information to\nthe brain and initiate Vision\nUnfortunately they left the science on\nthe table and this is actually what I'm\ndedicating the next phase of my career\nto bringing the science that we know\nthat we talked about to the table for\nvision engineering and in particular the\nfact that there are there really are 20\nor so distinct cell types and they send\ndifferent types of visual information to\nthe different targets in the brain I\nlike to think of them a little bit as uh\nan orchestra playing a symphony each\ndifferent cell type has its particular\nscore the violins do one thing the obos\ndo something else it's a very organized\nsignal coming out of the retina\npresenting to the brain this complex\npattern of electrical activity that the\nbrain assembles into our visual\nexperience well current retinal implants\nunfortunately are too crude to do\nanything like that the the conductor has\njust scattered the sheet music\neverywhere and people are playing\nwhatever it's cacophony okay you can\nmaybe recognize a tune in there a little\nbit sometimes navigate toward a doorway\nbut you're not going to get the full\nrichness of the experience by ignoring\nthe different cell types and I'm so\npassionate about this in part for\nreasons that a little bit are similar to\nyour reasons for doing this kind of work\nthat you do which I think is\ngreat which is I I feel we have a\nmission to give back as scientists to\ntake all this stuff we've been talking\nabout because we find it so interesting\nand\ncool and to deliver something to the\nsociety that has allowed us to explore\nthese fascinating areas and in our case\nit's in my the case of my lab and what\nwe've done it's to turn around and say\nwait a second we understand that there's\nthese different cell types we understand\na lot about what they do none of this\ninformation appears in current epir\nretinal implants can't we do better by\nusing the science to restore Vision in a\nway that respects the circuitry of the\nretina that's what we're trying to do\nand the mismatch is intense um I I told\nyou when we were adding\nbefore that nothing that we have learned\nabout the retina since the founding of\nthe national Eye Institute in\n1968 is incorporated into the existing\nretinal implants nothing we've learned a\nton about the retina your research was\nfunded by the national Eye Institute my\nresearch is funded by national ey\nInstitute a fantastic organization that\nallows us to learn all these things how\nis this showing up in the\nneuroengineering to restore Vision to\npeople well currently it's not\nand so we're trying to do that now doing\nthat turns out to be hard and maybe\nwe'll talk about that it's a it's a\ntechnological feat that's really\nchallenging you have to build a device\nthat you can implant in a human that can\nrecognize the distinct cell types see\nwhere they are stimulate them separately\nfrom one another and conduct this\nOrchestra to create a musical score that\nreasonably closely resembles the natural\none that's what we're all about doing\nand as it turns out and maybe we'll talk\nabout that separately that mission of\nbeing able to restore the patterns of\nactivity that the retina normally\ncreates also has extremely exciting\nspin-offs in three directions one of\nthem is understanding better how the\nbrain puts the signals together that's\nresearch for the brain the second one is\naugmenting Vision creating novel types\nof visual Sensations that weren't\npossible before and maybe doing\nsomething along the Elon Musk lines of\ndelivering more visual information than\nwas ever\npossible and third figuring out how to\ninterface to the brain more broadly\nbecause as you and I know the structure\nof the retina is very much\nrepresentative of the structure of many\nbrain areas and if we're going to figure\nout how to interface to the visual\ncortex we darn well bitter figure out\nhow to interface to the retina first\nthat's what we're all about doing in my\nlab these days is figuring out how to do\nthat well that's a mixed science and\nengineering effort we've done about 15\nyears of basic science on that how do we\nstimulate cells how do we recognize\ncells how are we going to build a device\nthat does all this and talks to the\ncells in this way and I can go into lots\nof gory detail about it um but that's\nwhat we've been doing the basic research\non and the last few years we've worked\nat Stanford with um fantastic Engineers\nfrom various disciplines electrical\nengineers material scientists others to\nfigure out how to put together the\npieces and build an implant that can do\nthis in a living human so is the idea to\nbuild a robotic retina to build a a\nessentially an artificial retina that\ncould be put into the eye of a blind\nperson or even put into the eye of a\nsighted person that would fundamentally\nchange their ability to see or in the\nlatter case uh enhance their ability to\nextract things from the visual world\nthat they would otherwise not be able to\nsee like like seeing twice as far um\ngetting you know hawk-like resolution of\nthe visual World um yep or which that\nwould be cool yep could be distracting\nyep like I'm not sure I want to see the\nthe fine movements of a piece of paper\nin somebody's notebook from across a\ncafe as they flutter the pages um but\nyou might want to for a moment there\nmight be a moment when you want to and\nif you have an electronic device that\nyou can control that you can dial in to\nsense different aspects of the visual\nWorld Under You Know by by your choice\nyou might be like yeah that's pretty\ncool I want to be able to do that right\nnow there's an example I like to give\nwhich I think maybe is is helpful for\ninterpreting what we're talking about\nwhen we say being able to do more things\nwith the optic nerve you gave the\nexample of many voices and stuff here's\nan example that I like we know that we\ncan drive down the road and have a phone\ncall\nhandsfree and do that quite safely\npretty safely right and you're why\nbecause you're tapping in you've got two\ntypes of signals coming into your brain\nyour visual signal of the cars on the\nfreeway any one of which could kill you\nin an instant so it's\nimportant and the sound coming into your\nears which carries the voice of your\ngirlfriend that's telling who's telling\nyou something that you're interested in\nhearing and these are different parts of\nthe brain processing this information\nand so you can do both of these things\nat the same time because there's no\ninterference one part of the brain is\nworking doing one thing another part's\ndoing something else you're good what\nyou can't do is to read your texts and\ndrive down the freeway at the same time\nthat's not good because now that visual\nsystem of yours that needs to be\ndetecting these fast moving dangerous\nobjects is being distracted by looking\nat the text and you might die and some\nother people might die with you so I see\na lot of people texting and\ndriving yeah that's why I like to point\nout this example to remind people you\ncan't do it well it's like it's like you\ncan't do it well you probably talk yeah\nit used to be you know we'll just take a\nbrief uh tangent here into this topic um\na few years back there were there were a\nlot of news articles a lot of discussion\nabout texting and driving a lot of\nattention to getting people to stop\ntexting and\ndriving I've seen a few people pulled\nover for texting and driving before but\nI would say texting and driving is\nrampant reading what's on one's phone y\nwhile driving is rampant yep all you\nhave to do is be on the freeway here in\nLos Angeles look in the car next to you\nyep look where they're looking and\npeople like reading and texting while\ndriving presumably when they're doing\nthat they're just using their peripheral\nvision to detect any kind of motion and\num no doubt this has caused the deaths\nof many people yeah change lanes get\naway from them and you know just just\nlike that other driver so so here's the\nthing um and this is this is uh I say\nthis a bit tongue and cheek but it's\nit's sort of a real example it may be\nthat if we harness the different cell\ntypes in the\nretina to deliver different visual\ninformation to different cell\ntypes like the image of the text on your\nscreen to a certain cell type that you\nknow the so-called\ncells or the motion of the objects in\nthe visual scene the cars to a different\ncell type cells by the way folks\nbecause they're very very small yes and\nby named by anatomist decades ago so we\ncarry that nomenclature forward sure um\nand the parasol cells which are\ndifferent cells that you can potentially\nencode the movement of the cars in the\nparasol cells and if those two systems\nare operating independently which we\nsort of think they may be from research\nthat you know very well from your\nextensive studies and vision\num maybe we can do those two things\nsafely at the same time now by the way\nthat's not my research goal to text and\ndrive at the same time just to be clear\nbut it's a very tangible real world\nexample of if we do really have parallel\nPathways that can be modulated and\ncontrolled independently of one another\nthis opens the door to streaming all\nkinds of visual information in parallel\ninto our very high band with visual\nsystems that wasn't possible during\nEvolution because we didn't have control\nover the cell types so I think of that\nas the world of visual augmentation and\nit starts to get interesting if the\ndifferent cell types are behaving in an\nindependent way and when they transmit\nvisual information to the brain now how\nare we going to figure that out well we\nneed a device that can stimulate the\ndifferent cells independently and then\nstudy that to see whether people can and\ncan do this kind of thing right what's\nthat device the artificial retina the\nsame implant I'm telling you about that\ncan restore Vision to people because\nit's an electronic device that can up in\nthe activity in the different cell types\nthat same device is what we can use as a\nresearch instrument to understand if the\ndifferent pathways are parallel if the\nsignals interact with one another and\nexplore how the brain receives that\ninformation and then we can use that to\nexplore can we augment vision and allow\nallow ourselves to have new visual\nSensations that we don't even know what\nthat would look like we we we don't even\nunderstand what it would look like to us\nto see those Sensations but it might be\nable to deliver lots of information to\nour brain and if we can do all those\nthose things then we can take that same\nset of tools and Engineering\nTechnologies into the brain to access\ndifferent cell types as well I'd like to\njust take a quick break and acknowledge\none of our sponsors inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes

done um\nyou started off with the understanding\nthat the neural retina is perhaps the\nbest place to try and understand how the\nbrain works because of its Arrangement\nthe cell types Etc you spend a number of\ndecades doing these wild experiments um\non human retinas and other retinas um\nrecording the different cell types with\nthese high density What I Call Bed of\nnails two and a half decades I'm not\nthat two and a half decades um it's your\nuh robustness that matters EJ um and you\nhave plenty of it um you figure out what\nthe cell types are so then you gained an\nunderstanding of how light is\ntransformed into different types of\nelectrical signals that encode different\nfeatures in the visual scene then comes\nthe challenge of developing\nneuroengineering tools to try and\nstimulate the specific cell types in a\nway that more or less mimics their\nnormal patterns of activation like not\num activating a huge piece of retina so\nthat you know the cells that like\nincreases in redness are also being\nstimulated with the cells that like you\nknow edges in a way that would create\nsome shoy like crazy representation of\nthe outside world no you want the same\nPrecision that light stimulation of\nthese cells in the intact human eye\nprovides in this explanted retina this\nretina on this bed of nails but then a\ndevice that essentially can mimic what\nthe retina does and you needed to do all\nthat earlier work understanding like\nwhat does the normal retina do what does\nthe healthy retina do in order to try\nand develop this prosthetic device to\neither restore Vision\nor because it puts puts you in the\nposition of being able to stimulate\ncells however you want in theory you\ncould create a situation in a human\nwhere the cells that respond to um I\ndon't know outlines of objects are are\nhyperactive so that you\nknow the person could um effectively see\nobjects in one's environment better than\nanyone else yeah could perceive I know\nmotion is a tricky one but motion better\nthan anyone else could see detail in the\nvisual world that no one else could\ndetect we're not talking about turning\npeople into mantis shrimp um but the\nanalogy works because mantis shrimp can\nsee things that we can't and vice versa\nand so what you're talking about here is\nneural augmentation through the use of\nengineering yep and we often do talk\nabout it as sci-fi because the Sci-Fi\nwriters have been talking have been you\nknow writing about this for decades it's\nnot sci-fi anymore it's sigh it's\nstraight up sigh right now it's really\nwe just need to build the\ninstrumentation and start working with\nthose experiments to figure out how to\nmake make it work I think we have a\nresponsibility to do this because this\nis the way we take this kind of\ninformation all that's been learned\nabout the visual system by the national\nEye Institute since since 1968 and all\nthe people that it's funded to do this\nresearch and turn the corner and make a\ndifference for Humanity with it and I I\nassume and think that Humanity will be\nleveraging nervous system knowledge to\nbuild all sorts of devices that we can\ninterface to the world with I think you\nknow I don't know Elon Musk but I think\nhe's right about that that that's where\nwe're\nheaded it should be done well it's\nimportant to do it well um we will\nhopefully be more connected to truth in\nthe world if we're able to build devices\nthat give us better Sensations more\nacute understanding of what's going on\nout there better abilities to make\ndecisions and all that let alone just\nsee stuff so that Frontier of developing\nTechnologies to allow our brains and our\nvisual systems initially and then other\nparts of our brains to do things better\nis unbelievably exciting it is SciFi but\nI just want to emphasize I think it's\nthe responsible way to go to think about\nhow to do that well all technologies\nthat we develop can be used for good or\nfor ill and I'm sure some of your\nlisteners who are a lot a lot of very\npassionate thinking people out there\nthinking about neuroscience and the\nimplications worry what does this mean\nwe're going to be introducing electronic\ncircuits in our brains to do stuff yeah\nwell we will it's pretty much clear that\nHumanity will do that and\nso in any technology development you\nhave to think about well how do you do\nit well how do you do it for good there\nthere are popular movies right now about\ntechnology development such as\nunderstanding the structure of the\natom and that technology development can\nbe used for good or for ill to blow up\ncities or to save\ncivilizations how's it going to go well\nI think I think as scientists we're\nresponsible for advancing that in a\nthoughtful and meaningful way I think we\ncan do this in the retina it is the\nplace to start it's the and you know you\nI'm curious what you think actually as a\nscientist your background is in this\nfield or very close field to mine I know\nyou speak with all sorts of scientists\non this podcast um but this is pretty\nmuch your field or very close not the\nneuroengineering part but understanding\nthe retina I'm curious if you agree that\nthis is the place to start doing this\nstuff the first guest ever asked me a\nquestion on this podcast during a guest\ninterview um I think this would be a fun\nplace to both answer and Riff on this a\nlittle bit because um first of all I\nthink the retina is absolutely the place\nto start because we understand so much\nof what it does what the cell types are\nbut maybe by comparison a different\nbrain region the hippocampus which is\ninvolved in the formation of memories\nand other stuff but formation of\nmemories about what one did the previous\nday what one did many years ago Etc is\nan area that I think anytime the\nconversation about neural Prosthetics or\nneuroengineering or neuro augmentation\ncomes up people think oh wouldn't to be\ncool to have like a little stimulating\ndevice in the hippocampus and then if I\nwant to remember a bunch of information\nfrom a page or from a a lecture I just\nstimulate and then voila all the\ninformation is batched in there um while\nthat's an attractive idea I think it's\nworth pointing out right now that sure\nthere is a pretty decent understanding\nof the different cell types in terms of\ntheir shapes some of their electrical\nproperties of the hippocampus but there\nis in no way shape or form the depth of\nunderstanding about the hippocampus and\nwhat the individual cell types do and\nwhat the different layers of it do that\none has for the neural retina so what\nwe're really saying is if you stimulate\nthe hippocampus you'll likely get an\neffect but it's unclear what the effect\nis and it's not clear how to stimulate\nthat's to me the best reason to focus on\nthe retina because you know what the\ncell types are thanks to the work of\nyour laboratory and many other\nLaboratories you know what sorts of\nstimulation matter and it provides the\nperfect test bed for this whole business\nof neuro augmentation neuro neuroeng\nengineering I think there's also a\nbigger discussion to just frame this in\nwhich is so much of what we discuss on\nthis podcast with guests and in Solo\nepisodes relates to things like dopamine\nneur neuromodulator serotonin and\neveryone is interested in these things\nbecause they can profoundly change the\nway that we perceive and interact with\nthe world but one only has to look to\nthe various Pharmaceuticals that\nincrease or decrease these\nneuromodulators and know that indeed\nthose Pharmaceuticals can be immensely\nbeneficial to certain individuals I want\nto be clear about that but that whatever\nquote unquote side effects one sees or\nlack of effect over time is because\nthose receptors are like everywhere over\nthe around the brain so you can't just\nincrease dopamine in the brain and\nexpect to only get one specific desired\neffect yes so the reason you're here\ntoday um is not because we both worked\non the retina and it's not because we\nhappen to also be friends it's because\nuh to my mind your laboratory represents\nthe um Apex of precision in terms of\ntrying to figure out what a given piece\nof the brain in your case the neuro\nretina does parse all its different\ncomponents and then use that knowledge\nto create a real world technology that\ncan actually tickle and probe and um\nstimulate that piece of the brain in a\nway that's meaningful right not just\nlike sending electrical activity in and\nthat to me is so important I think if we\nwere going to think about levels of\nspecificity for manipulating the human\nbrain to get it an effect you would say\nokay crudest would be drugs take a drug\nincreases serotonin which might bind to\nparticular receptors let's take the drug\npsilocybin a lot of excitement about\npsilocybin we know that can lead to\nincreased connectivity between different\nbrain Reg at rest there's probably there\nis some demonstrated clinical benefit\nthere's also some potential hazards but\nit's very broad scale we don't know\nwhat's happening when the person is\nthinking about a uh you know a piece of\nmoss expanding into an image and a\nmemory of their childhood or it's like a\nmillion different things are happening\nthere and then at the other far extreme\nis the kind of experiment that you're\ntalking about stimulating one known type\nof retinal\ncell seeing what that means for visual\nprocessing or modeling what that means\nmeans for visual processing and then\nbuilding a device that can do exactly\nthat and then maybe ramp it up 20% 50%\nand because I think that represents the\nfirst step into okay how would you\nstimulate the hippocampus to create a\nsuper memory would you stimulate a\nparticular cell type in a particular way\nand to my knowledge There's You know\ndespite the immense excitement\nabout the hippocampus and understandably\nso there just isn't that precision and\nof understanding yet so uh forgive the\nlong answer but you know you ask me a\nquestion on on this podcast give a long\nanswer yeah and it specificity is what\nyou're talking about and we need\ntechnology to do that to to modulate\nneural circuits in a highly specific way\nwe got to start with the piece of the\nneural circuit we understand best and we\nhave best access to that's the retina\nit's sitting right there on the surface\nwe can get right into it and in install\ndevices we know so much about it that's\nthe place to start the place that we\nunderstand build Electronics that is\nthat is adaptive that senses what\ncircuit it's embedded in and responds\nappropriately it's not just Electronics\nyou stick in there and it does something\nand that's it no it it first figures out\nwho it's talking to and then learns to\nspeak the language of the nearb neural\ncircuitry so a smart device smart device\nlet's push on that a little bit so\num put a little chip onto the retina\nthat can stimulate specific cell types\nis there a way that it can use AI\nmachine learning that it can learn\nsomething about the tissue it happens to\nbe in contact absolutely in the simplest\npossible way the device Works in three\nsimple Steps step number one record\nelectrical activity which is what we do\nin our lab in a room full of equipment\nbut this is a 2mm size chip implanted in\nyour eye record the electrical activity\njust recognize what cells are there when\nthey're firing what electrical\nproperties they have to identify the\ncells and cell types in this specific\ncircuit in this human that's step one\nstep two stimulate and record so you\nfigure out oh this electrode activates\ncell number 14 with 50% probability this\nelectrode activates cell number 12 if\nyou pass a micro amp of current with\nthis probability and so on you make a\nbig table that tells you how these\nelectrodes talk to these cells in your\ncircuit that's step two calibrate the\nstimulation by stimulation and recording\nthen finally when you have a visual\nimage and you want to represent it in\nthe pattern of activity of these cells\nyou say okay I know from Decades of\nbasic science what these cells ought to\nbe doing with this image that's coming\nin I know exactly what they ought to be\ndoing that's what the science has been\ntelling us we've been studying the\nneural code for decades to understand\nthis I know what they should do use my\ndevice with my calibration where I know\nwhere the cells are I know how the\nelectrodes talk to them and bing bing\nbing bing bing activate them in the\ncorrect sequence that's what I think of\nas a smart device a device that records\nstimulates and records and then finally\nstimulates yes AI is part of that of\ncourse it is because this is a very\ncomplex uh transformation if you will\nfrom the external visual world to the\npatterns of activity of these cells it's\nnot easy to write down in just a few\nlines of code or in a few equations it's\ncomplicated and AI is really helpful for\nthat and learning by stimulating and\nrecording and aggregating information\nquickly so that you can then use the\ndevice that's absolutely a part of the\nengineering it let me be clear the AI\ndoesn't help us to understand it's just\nan engineering tool that helps us to\ncapture what this thing normally does\nand then go ahead and execute and make\nit do the thing it should normally\ndo I hope people um will appreciate this\nexample uh perhaps not you know not but\ngoodness I don't know 40 50 years ago\nbut still today uh one treatment for\ndepression is electric shock therapy uh\na very you know on the face of it\nbarbaric um treatment but effective in\ncertain conditions it's still used for a\nreason um but it can appear barbaric\nright you know people are have like a\nbite you know a bite device you know so\nthey don't um bite through their tongue\nor their lips they're you know they're\nstrapped down and they stimulate the\nwhole just like stimulate all neurons in\nthe brain essentially there's a huge\ndump of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators it's like drugs it's\ncompletely non-specific stimulation\neffectively probably even less specific\nthan drugs maybe and yet the clinical\noutcomes from electric shock therapy in\nsome cases are pretty impressive like\npeople um the brain is quote unquote\nreset they still remember who they are\num but presumably through the the the\nrelease of neuromodulators like dopamine\nserotonin acetylcholine in a very\nnon-specific way there has been some\nsymptom relief in some cases what you're\ntalking about is really the opposite\nextreme um you know before I said\nPharmaceuticals that tickle a particular\nneurom modulator pathway would be the\nopposite extreme I think electric shock\ntherapy is probably the the the most um\nextreme where is this whole business of\nneural prosthesis going outside of the\nvisual system like right now um I can\nimagine that there are little\nstimulators in the spinal cord for sake\nof restoring movement to paralyze people\num I realize this is not your field but\nis are you seeing impressive stuff there\num or is it still really really early\ndays there's absolutely impressive stuff\nuh particularly uh for example people\nreading out signal\nfrom the motor cortex or the language\ncortex in order to help people to\ncommunicate or to move cursors on\nscreens in order to interact with\ndevices these are paralyzed people par\nyeah excuse me paralyzed people who\ncan't interact with technology the way\nthat we do um and but with their\nthoughts can send signals through an\nelectronic device that can be used to\ncontrol a mouse on a screen and have\nthem connect to the internet that's a\nhuge deal to be able to have people do\nthat imagine how life changing would be\nto be able to communicate if you\ncouldn't before so there are wonderful\nexamples of that you know of them so do\nI the work of Krishna shanoy and Jamie\nHenderson at Stanford is one beautiful\nexample over the recent years Eddie\nChang doing stuff now uh you know\nneuralink doing doing this kind of stuff\nthe built on the work of Shino and\nHenderson and stuff so that's great um\nyou know stimulating in spinal circuits\nas you said for creating rhythmic\nmovements that's that's happening\nso this is an enormous space and in each\ncase what you said I think is really\nhighly relevant that electroshock\ntherapy you can think of that as look\nlet's say your computer is not behaving\nright you can reboot it might work then\nit'll start not working again then you\nhave to reboot it again well how often\ndo you want to reboot your computer it\ngets a little inconvenient to be\nrebooting your computer every five\nminutes maybe you want to go in and\nactually diagnose this thing and put in\na piece of software that fixes the thing\nthat was going wrong instead of\nrebooting your computer every 5 minutes\nright and I think of electric shock\ntherapy a little bit as a reboot um it's\nthat level so we want to intervene more\nspecifically how do you do that well you\nhave to understand the software in order\nto do that you have to have specificity\ncontrolling this thing in your computer\nnot this this this this or this this\nparticular thing that's going wrong you\ngot to interfere with that and change it\nand modulate it well that's what\nunderstanding the neural circuit is\nabout that's what building specific\nHardware that can activate specific\ncells is\nabout that's in in the case of the\nretina again it's just so obvious that\nit's right in front of us to do this\nstuff and it's right in front of us to\ntake us into augmentation to giving us\nbetter senses a fun example I like this\nis it's an interesting topic because the\nNational Institutes of Health that um\nfunds a lot of research that goes in\nthis direction tends to not be\ninterested in augmenting our senses they\nkind of want to they they draw a line\nmore or less at saying look we're trying\nto restore what we were as humans not\ncreate a new kind of\nhuman and that's an interesting question\nbecause I don't think there is a fine\nthere's an actual line a bright line\nbetween those things I don't think\nthere's a bright line between those two\nthings the the finest example I know is\nthat even in the very crudest visual\nrestoration devices you have to actively\nsuppress the infrared sensitivity of\nyour camera\nto not have infrared vision why because\nmany cameras are sensitive to infrared\nlight so in other words if you don't put\nan infrared filter in front of your\ncamera you're going to have some\ninfrared vision maybe it won't help you\nvery much whatever I'm just trying to\nsay as soon as you start building\ndevices to restore Sensations building\nelectronic devices augmentation is right\naround the corner it'll creep up on you\nreal fast so I I think you you can't\neven really draw a\nline throughout today's discussion we've\nbeen thinking of the brain as kind of a\nthe rest of the brain I should say\nbecause the neural retina is two pieces\nof the brain extruded out into the eye\nGlobes during development I like to\nremind people of that over and over when\nyou're looking at somebody's eyes you\nare looking at two pieces of their brain\num so no debate about that but most\npeople don't realize that you'll never\nlook at anyone the same way again but\nthis is the reason why you can tell so\nmuch about people's inner state from\ntheir from their eyes somebody who's\nsleep deprived it's not just about the\ndroopiness of their eyelids or the\ncircles under their eyes there's a\nthere's an aliveness to the eyes the the\nyogis um talk about um people that sort\nof show up at the level of their eyes as\nopposed to sunk back into their brain\nyou know these are very um kind of\nabstract Concepts but they and there's\nsome very non-abstract stuff these days\nlooking at looking through the eye at\nthe retina the way the op\nopthalmologists do and there's a lot of\ndiagnostic capability just in those\nimages of the rtina oh right there I'm\nglad you brought this up there's um some\nuh interesting and increasing evidence\nthat looking at the neural retina\nbecause it is a piece of the brain with\nneurons that have the potential to both\nThrive or degenerate that looking at the\nneural retina which one can do with\nthese new technologies um can provide a\nwindow into um whether or not there are\nforms of degeneration such as\nAlzheimer's and other forms of neurod\ndegeneration deeper within the brain\nthat one can't image directly because of\nthe the thick opacity of the skull right\nso in other words Imaging the eye in\norder to determine if someone is\ndeveloping in Alzheimer's because you\nhave a direct view into a little piece\nof the brain it's a it's a good signal\nit can help you figure stuff out about\nwhat's going on in your brain even\nbeyond the sunken eyes\nabsolutely amazing so I think the rest\nof the brain piece is is also really\ninteresting and maybe here we can go\nlike semi neuro philosophical um you\nknow that there are clearly parts of the\nbrain that are involved in um essential\nwhat I call housekeeping functions\nregulating respiration you know keeping\nus breathing keeping our heartbeating um\ndigestion um responding to threats in in\nsome sort of basic way like through the\nsecretion of adrenaline and and giving\nus the potential to move but a lot of\nthe brain is is um capable of plasticity\nand um one wonders if you were to for\ninstance develop a retinal\nprosthesis that would allow me to um see\nwith twice the level of detail that I\ncurrently can would my adult brain be\ncapable of dealing with that information\nwe're talking about twice as much\ninformation coming in same brain tissue\non the receiving end can it make sense\nof it do we have any idea if it can make\nsense of it are there um are there\nexperiments that speak to that yeah\nthat's a fantastic and interesting\nquestion it makes you think about neural\ndevelopment all over again right and I I\ntake some inspiration on that from the\nwork of someone you know Eric nson um\nwho discovered that there is plasticity\nbeyond the period periods of time he\ndiscovered many wonderful things but\nthere's plasticity well beyond the\nperiod of time that we thought that\nthere was plasticity in certain animals\nand in particular that if you make\ngradual adjustments to the sensory world\nyou can exhibit plasticity that you\ncan't see if you make an Abrupt\nadjustment so plasticity is there it\njust has to be brought on by more subtle\nmanipulations that take you from A to B\nin little incremental steps and if you\ntake those incremental steps you can see\nthe adult\nplasticity so coming to your\nquestion is the brain capable of\nreceiving the kind of extra information\nwe provided could be that if we just\nshow up on day one bam try to deliver\ntwice the visual resolution or whatever\nin your visual your visual\nsystem it could be that if we try to\ndeliver twice the visual resolution on\nday one it won't work you'll see It'll\nyou know it won't look sensible to you\nbut if we gradually introduce it by the\nway that we're dialing up the resolution\nwe may be able to get there and there\nare fascinating studies to be done you\nthink about Spike timing dependent\nplasticity a term that that your viewers\nmay not all know but is a is related to\nhow neurons adjust their strength of\nconnectivity to one another according to\nthe timing of the signals in those cells\nmechanisms like that tell us wow the\nbrain really cares about the very\nprecise timing of stuff and to the\ndegree that that influences the way that\nneurons do or don't strengthen their\nconnections to one another it's so\nfundamental in everything from memory to\nvisual function what have you this\nrelates to fire together wire together\nalthough um it highlights the Together\npart how closely in time do two neurons\nneed to be active in order for them to\nsubsequently increase their connectivity\nand indeed one of them needs to be\nactive a little bit before the other one\nin order for it to work optimally right\nso if it what I what I Envision is that\nwhen we have full control of the neural\ncode with an electronic implant that can\ntalk to the cells and do all the things\nthat I said and we can really control\nthe neural code coming out of the retina\nwe can then start to play games and dial\nup that neural code very slowly and\nteach the remaining brain how to\nunderstand these signals not introduce\nsome crazy thing from day one no just\ngradually teach isn't that how we do\neverything well isn't that how\nplasticity\nworks I love the uh subtlety and the uh\nrationality of your example because you\nknow so much of what we see in the\ninternet and on the news is like you\nknow chips inserted into the brain to\ncreate super memory or uh you know\nconversations between you know 50 people\nat the same time without anyone speaking\nyou know just hearing other people's\nThoughts by way of um you know neural\nsignals being passed from one to the\nnext but yet another reason why you're\nhere today is because you represent the\nthe the realistic grounded um\nincremental approach to really parsing\nthis whole thing of how the brain works\nand how one then goes about um\nengineering devices to augment the human\nbrain and as you just pointed out it's\nnot going to be done by just sticking\nelectrodes in and stimulating and seeing\nwhat happens in fact those experiments\nwere done in the 1960s people like\nRobert Heath would put electrodes into\nthe brain during neur surgery stimulate\nand just see what the patient would do\nor what they reported thinking you know\nnowadays that's done still but with a\nlot more precision and intention and\nwe've moved we've moved far beyond that\nby the way I just want to say those were\nimportant first experiments the first\nthing got to do Keith was was was a\nrather um let's be honest not not the\nmost Savory character he he embarked on\nsome experiments that um had a social\nagenda to them and was a pretty pretty\nuh at least by my read was was not the\nkind of person I'd want to spend time\nwith to say the least but but you're\nright those experiments were critical\nbecause like electric shock therapy like\nthe formulation of drugs that can\nmassively increase certain neurom\nmodulators or decrease them they LED to\nsome level crude but some level of\nunderstanding about how the brain works\nwhich is what we're really talking about\ntoday yep um but you represent the uh as\nI said the the astronauts of this\nastronauts don't go into space and just\nkind of blast off and see where they end\nup there's a there's there's math\nthere's physics uh there's computer\nscience sensors cameras right looking\nwhere are we about to land here on the\nmoon is there a crater here or not what\nwhat's around us we we should sense\nwhat's there and then make our decisions\naccordingly and our electronic implants\nin the brain really we should make them\nsmart why make them dumb we're smarter\nthan that we can build implants that can\nsense what's around them and change\ntheir patterns of activity\naccordingly I I use a metaphor sometimes\nif you go to if you go as an American\nwho doesn't speak Chinese to China and\nyou start yelling in English maybe\nsomebody will to to learn which way to\ngo on the street somebody might\nunderstand you at some point and help\nyou out but it's going to be a it's\ngoing to be a you know not very\neffective way to get around it's way\nbetter if you speak the language you\ntalk to people and ask ask them where to\ngo so that's what we need to know we\nneed to say look we have the science we\nhave incredible devices we can engineer\nwe have ai now that even helps us to do\nthis query of the outside world and turn\nit into a smarter instrument make our\ninstruments smart make them so they know\nhow to talk to the brain don't expect\nthat the brain is just going to wrap\nitself around your your simple\nelectronic device no make a smart device\nthat's what we want to make a smart\nrental\nimplant maybe we could just take a\ncouple of minutes and talk a little bit\nabout you and the some of the things\nthat have led to your choice to go in\nthis direction\nso did you always know you want to be a\nneuroscientist from the time you started\ncollege what was your trajectory I\nshould know this but I you were an\nundergraduate at at Princeton at\nPrinceton that right studying math math\nso you could have just done all your\nwork with a piece of paper and a pen but\nyou had to try and engineer all these\nelectrodes okay that's a pen and paper\npen I took a very random route I studied\nmath as an undergrad I spent a few years\nrunning around playing music and\ntraveling living a Bohemian life well\ntell me more about that oh it was I\nbasically just told you all I'm going to\ntell following the Grateful Dead no not\nquite following them but uh it was that\nwas an important part of the story um\nand important part of your personal\ndevelopment um yes very much so uh free\nExpression Dance music creative\nexploratory music all that kind of stuff\nsuch a contrast to the the EJ that comes\nforward when we're talking about the\nPrecision of neural stimulation in in\nthe in specific retinal cell types but I\nthink it's useful for people to hear\nboth young and old like um that uh one's\nnervous system can be partitioned into\nthese different abilities like go and\ndance and travel and you you weren't\ndoing anything academic at that at that\ntime no for a few years I wasn't doing\nthat programming computers to make a to\nmake a living and uh then I started I\nstarted three different PHD programs at\nStanford before I simultaneously no no\nno in sequence I started in the math PhD\nprogram I learned that was not really\nfor me and I started in a in an\neconomics PhD program in the business\nschool there and I realized after after\nless than a year that was not for me um\nI worked in a startup company for a\nwhile I did a lot of stuff for a few\nyears and it took some settling um but\nthen I decided to go into nurse science\nand there were a couple formative things\none is that I had I had gotten a really\nformative experience as an undergraduate\nfrom a wonderful guy called Don ready\nwho taught a introductory Neuroscience\ncourse who was really inspiring Mentor\num and then when I when I was at\nStanford I met Brian wandell my PhD\nadviser and I was inspired by him I\nthought I didn't know why he was\nstudying what he was studying but I just\nknew I wanted to learn from this man and\nI wanted to study with him I just knew\nthis was this was the person who should\nbe my mentor based on something about\nhim yes C can I ask you about these\nthree PHD programs because I think\npeople here um you know or or see what\nyou're doing and and probably imagine a\nvery linear trajectory but now I'm\nhearing you you like tour it around\nplaying music then you start a PhD\nprogram nope then another one nope then\nanother one without getting into all the\ndetails I mean were there nights spent\nlying awake thinking like what am I\ngoing to do with my life or did you have\nthe sense that you knew you wanted to do\nsomething important you just hadn't\nfound the right fit for you like how how\nmuch anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 10\nbeing total panic um did you experience\nat at the Apex of your anxiety in that\nkind of wandering am I allowed to go\nabove 10 like turning up the amp to 11\nsure I just think it's really important\nfor people to hear whether or not they\nwant to be scientists or not this idea\nthat people that are doing important\nthings in the world uh in my view um um\nrarely if ever understood that that's\nthe thing that they were going to be\ndoing there was some wandering about\nthat sure seems like it doesn't it yeah\nI I I experien the same when I talk to\nother people and it seems like that and\nfor sure for me uh it just took a while\nof trying different things to see number\none what I was really good at and where\nI felt I could make a difference and it\nand I realized um I studied math and I\nwas okay at math but I know I I have\nknown mathematicians who are really\ntalented gifted mathematicians the one\nwho really make a difference I wasn't\ngoing to be one of those people likewise\nplaying music I don't have that\nintrinsic Talent it's fun I can play\nsongs in front of people and do stuff I\nlike it and stuff like that but I don't\nhave that kind of talent in fact I'll\nsay something that that I say to friends\nsometimes and you're a good friend of\nmine if I had the talent to get a few th\npeople on their feet dancing by playing\nmusic I'd probably just do that really\nas long as we've been friends I knew\nnone of this I like knew none of this\nmostly because I think we always end up\ntalking about Neuroscience or other\naspects of our life um but I I didn't\nknow I I know I know a great many things\nabout you but I had no idea it's so\ninteresting um do you still do dance we\nhad Eric Jarvis on the podcast by the\nway Professor Rockefeller who studies um\nat one point was studying um uh Speech\nin so in Birds um and song in Birds and\nthen he's done a great many other things\nnow in genetics of of vocalization and\nyou know he actually uh danced with or\nwas um about to dance with the Alvin ay\nDance Company it's like a really really\ntalented dancer um uh and so you know\ndance seems to be like a theme that\ncomes up among the Neuroscience guests\non this podcast do you still dance yeah\nI love to dance I'm a free form dancer I\ndon't I'm not a skilled dancer but I\nlove I love music I love dancing I think\nit's part of the human spirit I someday\nwill understand the Neuroscience behind\ndancing Dan in right dancing is a\nuniversal human thing in all cultures\nwhat is this dancing thing why do we do\nthis and other creatures don't well\nJarvis thinks that um perhaps it's one\nof the more uh early forms of language\nand that song came before spoken\nlanguage it's sort of interesting that\nbirds that um can actually recreate\nhuman speech oftentimes have the ability\nto dance as well oh wow um and and so\nthere's some commonality of circuitry\nthere we'll provide a link to that\nepisode jar really I would love to hear\nthat I mean I but if I may I just I'd\nlike to Riff on that in a different in a\ndifferent way um I did spend some time\nwandering around as many people do um\nand I think particularly for your young\nlisteners and viewers who don't know wow\nyou know could I ever be a scientist and\ndevelop new things stuff like that yes\nyou can and if you're messing around\nyour life trying this trying that trying\nthe other thing definitely stick with it\nkeep looking for the thing that works\nfor you I I really deep believe that you\ngot to play around you got to find what\nit is that works for you interestingly\nenough at least it's interesting for me\nI I spent a lot of years studying the\nretina in a pure basic science just\ncuriosity driven research way as you and\nI have both done in the\npast\num and as it turned\nout I learned all the stuff I needed to\nknow about the retina to do to develop a\nhigh fidelity adaptive retinal implant\nof the type that I'm talking about in\nthat process the technology the\nstimulation recording figure out the\ncell types how do you stimulate all\nstuff I learned all that stuff and I\nhave come to a point in my life where I\nrealize wow if somebody's going to do\nwhat I think needs to be done which is\nto take everything we've learned about\nthe retina and instantiate that in in\nsmart technology that can restore vision\nand do all the things we've been talking\nabout who who are the people in the\nworld who have the right training and\nbackground and knowhow to do that stuff\nI I'm one of them I I know that and it's\ntotally by chance that I picked up and\nlearned or it seems by chance that I\npicked up and learned the things that I\nneed to know for this so but but I'm I\ndefinitely have the right knoow to do\nthis based on all my training and the\nresearch that I've done and it feels\naccidental sometimes I look back on my\nown history I'm like how did I get here\nwhere this is obviously the thing I need\nto do was this this on purpose it didn't\nseem like it was on purpose but now I\ngot to do this because I know what needs\nto be done and it's something that needs\nto be done so that's that's my mission\nfor the you know coming decade or so\nwild I I mean I knew you had this\nengineer matthy uh geeky Neuroscience I\ndon't want to say geeky cuz I'm well\nbecause it makes it sound like I'm not\nright there in the same same uh raft\nwith you but but I didn't know about\nthis more free-spirited um move in all\ndirections depending on what one feels\nthe moment dancing uh EJ it's very cool\num are you still a a absolute level 11\ncoffee snob yes okay yeah I used to go\nto meetings and um EJ would bring his\nown coffee maker and coffee to to\nmeetings we're not talking about an\nespresso machine we're talking about\nlike extreme levels of coffee snobbery\npress pot the correct ground coffee\ncorrect kind of press byot good good\ngood I I expect nothing less uh proof\nthat um not all circuits in the brain\nare neurop plastic nor should they be\nthat's right but to bridge off of that\nin a more serious way um despite the the\nfree you know free exploration aspect to\nyourself and and that hopefully other\npeople don't suppress um it seems like\nyou you really are um good at develop\nlike knowing your taste like it seems\nlike the the I think it was the great\nMarcus Meister a colleague of ours who\nyou know has also worked on the neural\nretina extensively of course once said\nyou know that there's a coding system in\nthe brain that leads to either the\nperception the the feeling of um yum\nyuck or me and that so much of life is\nbeing able to register that in terms of\nwho you interact with and how and um the\nthe choices of problems to work on it\nseems like you have a very keen sense of\nof like yes that and you move toward\nthat you've always been very goal\ndirected um since the time I've known\nyou so and and you've picked such a a a\nhuge problem but going about it in in\nsuch a precise way hence the the analogy\nto the space space mission so um like\nwhen you experience that um may ask is\nit does it come about as like a thought\nlike oh yeah that has to be the thing or\nis it like a whole body sensation what a\ngreat question I love that question I\nhave two things to say to that the first\nis that for me it's all it's all\nfeeling I I don't make hardly any\ndecisions out of thoughts I think I\nprocess I put it all into the hopper and\nthe hopper comes out and spits out a\nfeeling and feeling's like yeah that's\nthe thing to do 100% And I know not\neverybody's like me lots of people\naren't like me and particularly lots of\nscientists aren't like me that you know\nso but but I definitely roll that way\nthat is absolutely how I work there's\nthere's something that's related to that\nthat I think is you know philosophically\nin terms of personal development and\nSpiritual Development stuff I think is\nquite relevant that I think you'll\nyou'll relate to my favorite aphorism is\nknow\nthyself the\nOracle and I I think because if you\ndon't know yourself you can't do\nanything you don't even know where to go\nyou can't even you know Orient yourself\nat the next thing in your life and I\nthink it deserves to have um two Aries\nthat go with it or\naenda uh know thyself be thyself which\nis not easy it's not easy to really be\nyourself in this world there are all\nsorts of things telling us to be\nsomething other than what we\nare and the third one is love\nthyself and it's you know having gone\nthrough\nmuch exploration of yourself and your\nlife and your values and my and me too\nand all the things we've talked about\nover time that's not easy some of us are\nnot necessarily programmed to love\nourselves and uh it's a\nskill I and I really I try my best to be\nwith those three things all the time\nknow thyself be thyself love thyself\ncould you elaborate a little bit more on\nyour process for the third I this is a\nconcept that um has been very\nchallenging for for me and I think for\nmany other people um and it gets um\nkind of opaque when it starts getting\ncomplete with like self-respect and and\nEtc like like loving thyself do you have\npractices um do you meditate um do you\nJournal do you spend time um trying to\ncultivate a love for self yeah yeah I'm\nI meditate in an informal way in the\nmorning with my coffee every morning I\nmake a fantastic cup of coffee and I sit\nwith it I believe you for five or 10\nminutes and take in my world as it's\ncoming toward me and start to be as I as\nI come into the day and come into\nConsciousness I I I meditate like that\nand I have a aanga related yoga practice\nmany of you many of your viewers and\nlisteners will know about Ashtanga Yoga\nit's a very physical spiritual\ntraditional yoga practice that has a\ndeep meditative and breath Focus\ncomponent I know you've had lots of\nepisodes and discussion about the breath\nand the importance of that for awareness\num you know at the end of a of many\nWestern Yoga practices you end with\nNamaste which is expressing your respect\nand for the connectedness of what is in\nfront of you to the whole universe and\nwhat's common to all of us and\neverything and I usually practice yoga\nby myself and when I say namaste at the\nend of my yoga practice a part of that\nis to myself earlier when I asked you\nabout how you guide your decisions you\nsaid it's all feel and you provided a\nbeautiful description as to how and why\nthat occurs for you and your trust in\nthat I don't recall you saying whether\nor not the feeling is in your head or\nit's a whole body feeling does it have a\nparticular signature to it that you'd be\nwilling to share is it excitement that\nmakes you want to get up and move or is\nit a a Stillness I think I I ask because\nwe've been talking throughout today's\nepisode about you know the Precision of\nneural coding and these signals that are\nat the level of individual cells and And\nyet when it comes to feeling we actually\nhave a a pretty crude map and certainly\na deficit in language to explain what\nthis feeling thing is and I I know that\npeople experience life and feelings\ndifferently but I think it's often\ninsightful when somebody uh with your\nunderstanding of the nervous system and\nyourself can share a bit like what does\nit feel\nlike I love that question and it relates\nto something you said to me years\nago uh what it feels\nlike uh is\nease and I remember years ago when we\nwere talking about challenging things\nthat each of us was facing in our lives\nyou said to me something like I I wish\nfor you some ease with all of this it\nwas very um moving touching as that's\nwhat a good friend does is to give that\nto somebody to who they love and um um\nand it sticks with me probably 10 years\nlater so\num the feeling I feel when I'm on the\npath that makes sense for me is ease\nit's there's just nothing it's just okay\nthis is\nit I love that I don't actually recall\nthat specific conversation because we\nhad many many conversations sitting in\nyour yard in San Diego on those plastic\nchairs with your\num with my Bulldog Costello hanging out\nby the way folks EJ knew Costello my\nBulldog Master very well and he was not\na huge fan of dogs prior to meeting\nCostello but um Costello flipped him he\nhe became a at least a Costello lover I\nlove Costello I'll never forget him yeah\nhe embodied\nease he did nothing but sleep and eat uh\nhe he embodied um energetic efficiency\nand everybody loves him everybody who\ngets to be in the same room with him\nloves him the people I just spoke to in\nyour setup here your colleagues you know\nyeah I could see why and you have a\nbeautiful photo of him hanging there\nyeah yeah he's a what a creature a great\ngreat memory definitely embedded in my\nnervousness I often choke up when I\nthink about but I I want to be clear\nbecause I've already cried once about\nhim on a different podcast I don't want\nto do that today they're not tears of\nsadness it's this crazy thing like I\nlove him so much I just kind of want to\nexplode so damn it costell got me again\nand publicly again so he's someplace\nlaughing so I I love that um and I think\nif um if I made you know do you think\nit's worth kids and adults learning to\nrecognize those those kind of States\nthose signals that tell them they're on\nthe right path by paying attention\nto I don't know this like like we said\nthere's sort of a deficit of language\nlike EAS is in the body eases in the\nmind it's the release of I mean you know\nit's not even worth exploring verbally\nbecause it's a is such a whole body\nwhole nervous system thing yeah I I I\nfeel like I I actually was thinking\nabout I was giving advice to a young\nfellow who uh is applying to graduate\nschool recently and had a zoom call with\nhim about stuff and he had received some\ngood advice from some other people and\nthen I gave him some advice and I saw\nhim and speak and emote and with body l\nlanguage drop into like oh yeah that\nmakes sense yeah that that feeling of\ncourse kind of the of course and I think\nif you can teach people to do that I\ndon't know if the verbal communication\nof that is going to like you said is\nthat going to do anything but can you at\nleast observe it in them as a teacher as\na mentor and do things and when you know\nwhen you've done it because you see them\ndrop into ease do you think you can\ndetect ease in people by looking at them\nand seeing their body body language and\neverything it's it's got to be an\namalgum of different things that the\nCadence of their breathing their pupil\nsize it's not worth dissecting this is\nan experiment I would not want to run\nyes right I wouldn't want to bring\npeople into a laboratory and figure out\nyou know what pupil of the eye Dynamics\ncombined with certain rhythms of\nbreathing relaxation of the shoulders\nbecause it's too beautiful for that is\nit's too beautiful and it's it's too\nnuanced and um it's different when we're\nin Motion versus when we're lying down\nit's like I mean science is capable of a\ngreat many things but I don't think\nneeds to be pointed at every aspect of\nHuman Experience I think they um some of\nthese things are are simply worth\nallowing to just be do you feel the same\nway about when you when you have a\nfeeling about a person you meet somebody\nand their energy just captures you it's\nlike wow what a cool person what what\namazing energy do you want to know the\nscience behind that I don't no I don't I\nthink the the word that comes to mind\nwhen I experience somebody like that or\nsomething like a animal or you see\nsomething the movement of something or a\nbeautiful piece of music or something is\nuh the word just\nbehold yeah I just want to stop and and\ntake in as much of it as possible and\nhere's something I know you've done but\nI'm checking to make sure I really got\nthis right because I've done it too\nbecause we sometimes get human retinas\nfor doing our experiments the first\nthing that happens when we get the human\nretina we bring it back to our lab it's\na big production everybody's getting\nready to go a whole bunch of moving\nParts going on we have to open up the\neye and look into it to see what\ncondition it's in and it's typically on\nwith a dissecting scope on a chair and\nit's open sitting on a chair dissecting\nscope looking down look into the\neye it is so beautiful it it's\nbreathtaking each time I've looked at\nthe retina I don't know how many times\neach time wow this is what's\ninitiating all the visual experiences\nI've ever had in my life or that person\never had in their life right and the\nbeauty just keeps coming I love it and I\nlove it because you're talking\nabout a behold moment that isn't just to\nentertain your curiosity sure it's that\nyou want to understand how the brain\nworks um but also a behold moment that\nleads from that desire to understand to\na deep level of understanding now after\nyou know more than two decades of\nexploration to a mission in service to\nhumanity restore Vision to the blind\ndevelop neuroprosthesis and other types\nof neuroengineering technologies that\nwill allow the human brain to function\nbetter than it would otherwise so\nthere's real purpose there too so it uh\nrepresents kind of a perfect ecosystem\nof it's not just about delighting in\nsomething and and um and spending one's\ntime there there's a real there's a real\nMission there so um I love\nit well EJ Dr\ncheski uh Dr huberman I rarely get\ncalled that these days um when I invited\nyou here today I was absolutely sure\nthat uh our listeners and viewers were\ngoing to get a absolutely worldclass\nexplanation of how the nervous system\nworks and the the retina and the visual\nsystem in particular and um that it\nwould be delivered with the utmost\nClarity which it was so thank you I know\nthere's been so much learning in and\naround that and you beautifully framed\nfor us what that means in terms of the\nlarger understanding of how the nervous\nsystem works and what you and other\nLaboratories are now in a position to\nreally do with that information and the\ntechnologies that are being built and\nthat will be built and you know the\npurpose in bringing you here today was\nwas just that but not that alone um you\nknow I think we hear so much about the\nbrain and how it works and everyone\nwants to have tools and protocols to\nfunction better but um\nit's clear that the work that you're\ndoing is headed in a Direction that's\ngoing to vastly expand the possibilities\nfor sake of treating human disease and\nand for expanding Human Experience I'm\nI'm certain of\nthat what I did not expect\nhowever was that when I wrote down one\nbullet point well actually two I wrote\nstill a coffee snob question mark the\nanswer is yes um and yoga you know that\nwe would end up in territory where you\nwould share some of your experience that\nI myself was not aware of about this um\na bit of a Wandering um of three\ndifferent PHD programs and of this um\ncultivation of an intuitive sense of of\nbeauty and taste and preference\nthat the way you described it takes you\nout of your rational mind and into the\naspects of your nervous system that just\nreally act as a compass toward what is\nabsolutely right for you and we're all\nso lucky that what's absolutely right\nfor you turns out to also be what's\nabsolutely right and beneficial for the\nworld so thank you for coming here today\nthank you for sharing your\nknowledge and your heart and for doing\nit with um such an incredible degree of\nof openness and respect so thank you so\nmuch thank you Andrew it's
