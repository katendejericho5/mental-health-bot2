    "video_title": "Dr. Cal Newport: How to Enhance Focus and Improve Productivity",
    "transcript": "welcome to the hubman Lab podcast where\nwe discuss science and science-based\ntools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Cal\nNewport Dr Cal Newport is a professor of\ncomputer science at Georgetown\nUniversity he did his training at MIT\nand he is currently both a professor and\nthe author of many best-selling books\nfocused on productiv\nfocus and how to access the specific\nstates of mind to bring out your best in\nterms of cognitive performance and\nindeed in terms of performance in all\nEndeavors one of his more notable books\nis entitled deep work rules for focused\nsuccess in a distracted World deep work\nis a book that has had tremendous\npositive influence on my work life and\nindeed my life in general because it\nspells out how exactly to go about doing\none's best possible work for me that's\nin the context of Science and podcasting\nBut it includes tools that I and many\nothers have extended to other aspects of\ntheir life as well and it's a book that\nI highly highly recommend everybody read\nCal also has a new book out now it's one\nthat I'm currently reading entitled slow\nproductivity the Lost Art of\naccomplishment without burnout and as\nthe title suggests it gets into specific\nprotocols to avoid burnout and to bring\nabout one's highest quality work over\nthe greatest amount of time today's\ndiscussion starts off with extreme\npractical steps that any and all of us\ncan use in order to enhance our level of\nfocus productivity and creativity Cal\nshares much of his specific practices\nand also offers some alternative\npractices for those of you that perhaps\ndo not want to disengage with social\nmedia or with smartphones or with email\nto the extent that he does I found the\nconversation to be extremely useful in\nthe sense that I indeed am on social\nmedia I use email I use my phone and\ntexting quite often so I'm not somebody\nwho's willing to completely disengage\nfrom those tools but I share in the\nsentiment that those tools can often be\nan impediment to doing one's best work\nso today's discussion gets into not hard\nand fast rules for enhancing focus and\nproductivity but a variety of different\ntools that you can select from in sort\nof a buffet to suit your particular\nneeds we also of course discuss the\nspecific research studies around focus\nand distraction task switching and\ncontext switching all of which support\nthe specific protocols that Cal offers\nso whether you're someone who has issues\nwith attention and focus or whether\nyou're somebody that's just feeling\noverly distracted by the number of\nthings in your email inbox or the number\nof text or what's happening out in the\nworld by the end of today's episode I'm\nconfident that you will be armed with\nthe best science supported tools that is\nprotocols in order to access the states\nof mind that will enable you to do your\nbest possible work before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep\nHelix sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute highest quality\nI've spoken many times before on this\npodcast about the fact that quality\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance and to\nget the best possible night sleep it's\nabsolutely key that your sleeping\nsurface that is your mattress suit your\nspecific spe ific needs Helix\nunderstands this and they developed a\nbrief two-minute quiz in which you can\nmatch your body type and sleep\npreferences that is whether not you\nsleep on your back your side or your\nstomach whether or not you tend to run\nhot or cold in the middle of the night\nperhaps you don't know the answers to\nthose questions that's okay you answer\nthe questions in that brief two-minute\nquiz and they match you to the specific\nmattress ideal for your sleep needs in\nmy case that was the dusk DS mattress I\nstarted sleeping on a dusk mattress well\nover three years ago and it has\nsignificantly improved my sleep and as a\nconsequence I feel more focused and\nalert I'm better able to do all the\nthings that I need to cognitively\nphysically throughout the day so if\nyou're interested in upgrading your\nmattress simply go to helixsleep.com\nhuberman take that brief two-minute quiz\nand they'll match you to a customized\nmattress ideal for you you'll get up to\n$350 off any mattress order and two free\npillows again go to helixsleep.com\nhuberman for up to $350 off and two free\npillows today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Maui Nei venison now venison is\nthe most nutrient-dense and delicious\nred meat available I've spoken before on\nthis podcast and there's General\nconsensus that most people should strive\nto consume approximately one gram of\nprotein per pound of body weight now\nwhen one strives to do that it's\nimportant to maximize the quality of\nthat protein intake to the calorie ratio\nbecause you don't want to consume an\nexcess of calories when trying to get\nthat one gram of protein per pound of\nbody weight Maui Nei venison has an\nextremely high quality protein to\ncalorie ratio so it makes getting that 1\ngr of protein per pound of body weight\nextremely easy it's also delicious\npersonally I like the ground venison I\nalso like the venison steaks and then\nfor convenience when I'm on the road I\nlike the jerky the jerky is a very high\nprotein to calorie ratio so it has as\nmuch as 10 grams of protein per jerky\nstick and it has something like only\nlike 55 calories so again making it very\neasy to get enough protein without\nconsuming excess calories if you would\nlike to try mauii venison you can go to\nmauii venison\nhuberman to get 20% off your first order\nagain that's Maui venison\ndocomo to get 20% off today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by ju ju makes\nmedical grade red light therapy devices\nnow there's one theme that I've\nconsistently put forward on this podcast\nit's the powerful role that light has on\nour mental health physical health and\nperformance juv makes medical grade\ndevices that emit both red and near\ninfrared light red and near infrared\nlight is so-called long wavelength light\nand it's able to penetrate deeper into\ntissues than shorter wavelength light\nlike blue and green lights those red and\nnear infrared long wavelength lights\nhave been shown to be beneficial for\neverything from skin Health to wound\nhealing to Eye Health and even for\nmitochondrial Health what sets juv apart\nfrom other red light and near infrared\nlight devices is that they are\nclinically proven to emit the specific\nwavelengths at the specific intensities\nrequired to achieve specific biological\neffects personally I use the ju handheld\nlight both at home and when I travel\nit's only about the size of a sandwich\nit's very convenient to use I also have\na ju whole body panel and I use that\nabout three or four times a week if you\nwould like to try ju you can go to\njv.com\nhuberman ju is offering an exclusive\ndiscount to all huberman lab listeners\nwith up to $400 off select ju products\nagain that's ju\njv.com huberman to get $400 off select\nju products and now for my discussion\nwith Dr Cal Newport Dr Cal Newport\nwelcome Dr huberman good to see you I'm\na huge fan I've been a huge fan ever\nsince I read deep work I can't say that\nI've adopted all the principles but\nthat's on me not you you provide\nincredible incentive for why one ought\nto pursue deep work and slow\nproductivity in service to high quality\ntrue productivity Etc um some of the\nprotocols as we'll call them are\nincredibly easy to Implement others take\nsome discipline so I'd like to talk\nabout both sets today but the first\nquestion I have is um do you own a\nsmartphone I do have a smartphone yeah\nwell here's the thing I don't use social\nmedia so it turns out smartphones aren't\nthat interesting if you don't have any\nsocial media apps on it yeah what's that\nlike so there's there's nothing if you\nhave nothing that is engineered to try\nto grab your attention the smartphone\nactually goes back to 2007 Steve Jobs\nkeynote address smartphone which is the\nis a really nice phone and your music\nyou can listen to things on it and uh\nthe phone interface is really good and\nlook there's a Maps app and you can like\nlook at maps on it like it's actually a\nuseful piece of technology that you're\nhappy to have but uh you don't use it\nthat\nmuch what about text messaging do you\ntext message and if so do you get into\nconversations by text or is it more of a\na plan and meet type tool uh I try right\nso so I try I do use text messaging I\nmean this is how like my wife gets in\ntouch with\nuh but I'm notorious somewhat among my\nfriends of my the ability to capture my\nattention with text messages really hit\nor miss because I'll go hours without\nlooking at my phone so it's not this\ndefault appendage I think for a lot of\npeople if you know someone you can\nbasically assume like look if I text\nthem they're going to get right back to\nme H my problem is I'll go to three four\nhours you know without looking at my\nphone and then there'll be text messages\non there from conversations that people\nwere trying to start and I typically\njust have to declare text bankruptcy a\nfew times a day like look if they really\nneeded me I guess they would have called\nso I do text but uh I'm not considered\nto be very good at it a few other\nquestions about your phone practices\nthis makes me nervous um is your phone\nin a drawer on on the desktop um while\nyou're working is it face down face up\nis the ringer on is it off Oh you mean\nif I'm writing or it's nowhere near me\nyeah Ian it could be anywhere it's just\nnot going to be anywhere near me so I\nhave in my house uh two different\noffices basically right so there's a\nhome office the pr is there the filing\ncabinets are there like the nice big\nmonitors there you pay taxes that type\nof thing and then I have a library and\nthere's no permanent technology in the\nlibrary no computer in there no monitor\nno printers nothing like this I have\nthis sort of custombuilt desk I had made\nby a company from Maine that makes desks\nfor college libraries like that's what\nthey do so I had this like custom fit\ndesk to fit into uh it's not that big of\na space that's where I go to write I'm\nsurrounded by books that I've really\ncarefully curated what's where each\nshelf like what type of book it has on\nit so I can look different ways for\ndifferent Inspirations I got a fireplace\nso I can just turn on a fire if I need\nit I'll bring my laptop in there to\nwrite if I'm going to write on a\ncomputer and my phone doesn't come in\nthere yeah you don't you don't look at\nyou don't look at a phone in that room\nand it just helps me it's a ritual right\nif I'm in there I'm thinking I'm\ncreating with the sort of same patterns\nof cogitation that we would have been\nusing for hundreds of years when people\nhave been thinking professionally if I\nwant to be near a printer and I want to\ngo on to a web browser and pay my taxes\nor whatever I have a different place for\nthat I'm curious about the fireplace I\nhave this Theory based on my\nunderstanding of visual neuroscience and\nthe fact that when we're looking at\nvisual scenes that have some degree of\npredictability to them yeah um we get\ninto a mode of anticipation our thinking\nis at least somewhat linear um and so\nforth when we are looking at say ocean\nwaves or um up in a skyscraper we're\nstaring down at the street of say New\nYork City and the cars are moving in\nobviously not random fashion but at\nleast to our visual perception pseudo\nrandom you're not tracking any one thing\nthat the the Mind goes into this sort of\num state where our thoughts become\nnonlinear they're not anchored to any\nkind of if then kind of what I call DPO\nduration path outcome kind of trajectory\nthere not a lot of Neuroscience on this\nbut there's a little bit same thing\nhappens when you're looking at an\naquarium by the way um so I wonder\nwhether or not staring at the fire which\nis something that humans have been doing\nfor many many many thousands of years um\nbecause it has that uh random aspect to\nit does it tend to spark creativity\nlinear thinking at what point in your\nwriting do you turn to the fire and\nstare at it oh that's interesting\nactually that there's a a neurological\nexplanation when I use to fire is\nactually when I read right so chairs by\nthe fire but I think for exactly this\nreason right because when I'm reading\nI'm looking to spark ideas right like\nokay what am I what's my takeaway from\nthis what's the connection you're making\nbetween this thing you're reading here\nand this idea over there that type of\nconnection making is a lot of my\nbrainstorming and I read by the fire\nwhen the weather allows it uh I also\nwalk a lot so I wonder if there's\nsomething similar going on like when I'm\ntrying to work through an idea for an\narticle or a math proof or something\nlike this almost always I'm going to do\nthat on foot and there might be\nsomething similar going on there where\nyou're encountering it's not entirely\nexotic stimuli right so it's not oh my\nGod you know my attention's being drawn\nbut it's you you don't you don't quite\nknow what you're going to see and you\nalso have that that circuit quieting\neffect of the walking your motor neurons\nare going you can tell me if I'm getting\nthis right or not abely the motor\nneurons are going and you get some\ninhibition going on in some of these\nthese key networks which allows you to\nactually um maintain the the the\ninternal focus on a concept a little bit\nbetter so I do a lot of my original\nfocused ideating on foot but a lot of my\nserendipitous ideating will be with the\nfire going right it's a win I read by\nthe fire and so when I read that I get a\nlot of my original ideas I have this\ntheory that the\ntwo opposite states of mind that both\nfacilitate creativity and\nproductivity look something like this\nand you can tell me whether or not this\nMaps anything that that you know one is\njust as you described our body is in\nmotion um could be running\nwalking might be in the shower or\nsomething of that sort uh but we aren't\ntrying to direct our mind toward a\nspecific linear trajectory or outcome\nit's not it's not like working out an\nequation or a theorem um the same way we\nwould if we were at a piece of paper or\nwriting out a sentence a structured\nparagraph So it's body and motion mind\nnot channeled toward one specific Target\num the opposite extreme to me is body\nstill mind very active um which\nresembles rapid eye movement sleep when\nwe learn a lot and neural rewiring\noccurs and dreaming but uh for which\nthere's also a lot of examples of very\naccomplished um creatives using that\nsort of thing of meditative like um\napproaches you know forcing oneself to\nbe still and thinking so it sounds like\nyou incorporate both um and I'm curious\nas a computer scientist who writes code\ndoes theorems does a lot of math where\nyou can't just kind of wing it yeah um\nright and wrong answer uh involved what\nis your mode for sitting down and\nworking through something that's linear\nand hard yeah that it's interesting the\nway you talk about it right because when\nI'm walking uh and this is actually\nsomething you can train you know and I\ntalked about this one of my books once\nthat you can actually train yourself to\nuh maintain your internal eye of focus\nmore stably while you're walking right\nso I called this productive meditation\nin deep work actually uh and I I\npracticed this in grad school right okay\nso I'm going to work on a particular\nproblem while I walk and then you\nactually practice bringing your\nattention back to the central problem\nand it I don't know exactly what's\nhappening but you get a little bit more\nuh facility working with your working\nmemory a little bit more efficiency with\nbringing stuff in and out of the working\nmemory and so I trained myself that I\ncould actually write a couple paragraphs\nin my head maybe not word for but\nbasically word for word like figure out\nhow I'm going to do it or uh figure out\nenough steps of a math proof to capture\na key Insight like okay I know I'm going\nto get around this then you have to sit\ndown and actually formally capture that\nand yeah for me that's still working\nwith notebooks though when I was coming\nup in grad school and I was just\nExcavating these thoughts recently we\nwere talking before the we recorded that\nyou know I just wrote this essay about\nwhat I learned as a grad student that\nimpacted all my writing uh as a grad\nstudent in the theory group at MIT which\nwas just purified concentration this is\nwhere all the Deep work ideas come from\nright I mean it was just worldclass\nconcentrators they're the method was\nvery still more than one person\nwhiteboard so if you have two or three\npeople staring at the same whiteboard\nyou're actually going to up the level of\nconcentration you achieve because if you\nlet your attention wander you disengage\nthat attention there's a social capital\ncost because now I've fallen out of the\nthe Whiteboard effect discussion that's\ngoing to be a problem so you actually\nmaintain your focus at a higher level\nand then when someone else is making\ntheir move okay you know what about this\nand they're working math it's all math\non the board you're giving that the\nhighest attention you're capable of\nbecause you want to keep up right you\ndon't want to fall behind so it was like\nthis Hack That was figured out in the\ntheory group that if you put two or\nthree people at the same whiteboard to\ntry to alchemize these insights into\nactual mathematically precise proofs you\nget a 20 30% boost in your concentration\nlevel and and that could make all the\ndifference right if you're working on a\nvery hard proof 20 30% boost could be\nthe difference between solving it or not\nin one of these situations where you're\nat the white whiteboard or chalkboard\nand their two other individuals facing\nit are they interrupting you or is the\num etiquette uh in that scenario to just\nlet the person go until their natural\nyeah uh inclination to raise a hand and\nand scream help whoever has the marker\non the board they're the one's talking\nso you go okay what about this you say\nand now you're working you're writing\ndown equations or drawing your diagram\nand everyone is just watching and then\nwhen they're done everyone steps back\nand looks at it then you can step\nforward okay but what if we did this and\nthen and you still work on it so so when\nI got uh built some offices or worked\nout some offices near my house like one\nof the first things we put in there was\na whiteboard so I could have computer\nscience collaborators come because we\ncan't work on Theory otherwise like it\nis the thing we need is a whiteboard\nright when I started grad school they\nhad just built this new $300 million\nFrank Gary design building for the\ncomputer science artificial intelligence\nlaboratory and uh Linguistics but half\nof it was computer science I know those\nbuildings cuz the peow and the McGovern\nNeuroscience C and those buildings are\nvery interesting people should check\nthem out if they're ever in Cambridge\nKendall Square stop the status Center\nyeah right down the street from the K\nsop yeah so the sixth floor was where\nthe theoreticians were this is where I\nwas uh so I you know they opened that\nbuilding the year I started my the\ndoctoral program and what did they want\nto show me when they when they brought\nme to this $300 million Building look at\nour whiteboards that's what they were\nproud of they had filled the common\nspace on the sixth floor the theory\nfloor with these uh freestanding\ndouble-sided whiteboards it was like a\nmaze of whiteboards and this is what\neveryone was so excited about was yeah\nlook at our whiteboard coverage\nsurrounded by a $300 million meal I Tred\nI was trying to explain this to someone\nrecently uh having good whiteboards to\nus as like an astronomer saying look we\ngot this great radio telescope like this\nis going to allow us to get data to work\non that we wouldn't otherwise have\naccess to I think to a theoretician uh\nthat's why you see a whiteboard because\nyou know if you want to think at the\nvery highest level you need two or three\npeople staring at the same thing taking\nturns with the marker or pushing each\nother past where they're comfortable I I\nlove this because I often think about\nvisual maps that represent our internal\nmemory stores and plans etc for\nproductivity I've always relied heavily\non the on the Whiteboard I getting one\nfor home I have one here in the podcast\nstudio all of my podcast notes for my\nsolo episodes are distilled down to four\n8 and 1 half by 11 notes which are\nphotographs of the the Whiteboard yeah\nand um I don't use a teleprompter um\nI've been accused of using one before I\ndon't even know how that would work um\nbut um it's extremely useful to use the\nWhiteboard and I think because um ideas\nare so easily put up there and removed\num there's something about uh writing on\nthings that are vertical as opposed to\non a flat surface I really because\nthat's actually the way our visual\nperception casts things we don't cast\nvisual perception onto the ground we're\nused we experience the visual world\nmostly in front of us I think the\ncognitive map and the visual map are\ninextricably linked for at least for\ncited folks um so I I think there's\nreally something there so um in the\nabsence of colleagues to sit there and\nboost our attention by 25 to 30%\num what could one do do you have a you\nsaid you have a whiteboard at home I\ncertainly use the Whiteboard do you um\nwork on it the same way you would in\nthose early days just with in the\nabsence of of colleagues looking on yeah\nyeah so you work on it just like\nsomeone's there uh the hack is using\nreally good notebooks that's always made\na big difference for me paper notebooks\npaper notebooks yeah yeah though though\nrecently I've been messing around with a\nremarkable which is one of these digital\nnotebooks where it's eink technology so\nit's like a Kindle but you can write on\nit h but you have endless pages on it so\nI've been messing around with that\nrecently but I remembered when I was a\npostto for example I found it recently I\nwent and bought a lab notebook because\nthose are expensive at least for a\npostto right they're like $70 because a\nlab note book has to have archival\nquality paper it's bound it's bound yeah\npeople might not realize this lab\nnotebooks need to be kept for many years\nyes you you uh you're not supposed to\ntear Pages out of them and so they tend\nto be bound so if you have terrible\nhandwriting like I do you just have to\ndeal with it yes you can't rip it out\nand it's thick thick paper acidfree\narchival paper big sturdy covers um but\nI bought this because I thought okay\nlook I'm going to take it more seriously\nbecause I think that's also part of what\ngoes on with the Whiteboard is your mind\nthinks about writing on uh the big\nvertical space as a a public\ncrystallization of thoughts I'm putting\nthis up for people to see even if\nthere's no one actually there to see it\nand so you take it more seriously right\nif I'm writing on a a whiteboard in\nclass I'm not just going to put up\nnonsense like I'm GNA be very careful\nabout what I'm writing because you\nimagine there's an audience this is\nsomething for other people to see and so\nyou get a little bit of a similar effect\nif you have a very nice notebook you\nthink look I don't want to waste pages\nand somehow that helps with the thinking\nso then I found this notebook because I\nstore my old notebooks in my closet so I\nfound it when I was working on a recent\nbook I found it I went through it right\nand then I started ticking off uh this\nturned into a paper this turned into a\ngrant this notebook I used it for maybe\ntwo years only used maybe about half the\npages it's all very careful neat script\nand diagrams I think I found seven\ndifferent peer-reviewed papers or funded\ngrants where the core ideas were in this\nnotebook so it's like that\n$70 was a an incredible investment\nbecause when I when I got to work in\nthat notebook it must have been\npushing my thinking to a new level\nbecause it was an incredible\nconcentration of actual publishable\nresults were coming out of his Pages\nyeah it seems like we would all do well\nregardless of our field um to have some\nvery low Bar Method of capture where if\nwe just have an idea that spontaneously\ncomes to mind that we can capture that\nin a voice memo or um dare I say in a a\nphone uh notes segment but then\nsomething as you're suggesting like a a\nwhiteboard um like a bound note notebook\nwhere the moment we look at it it brings\nabout a level of seriousness yeah to our\nto our thinking and to our actions like\nthis is different than just um texting\num I what we're really talking about our\nour kind of layers of sophistication um\nbut not in a snobby way in terms of um\nhighest productivity and quality to kind\nof um I don't know bubble gum wrapper on\non the floor type levels of quote\nunquote productivity well I mean I\nbecome a fan of this idea of of having\nspecialized capture for specific type of\nwork so for example I'm a big believer\nin pretty quickly you want to capture\nideas in the tool you use to do that\nwork so when I have ideas for an article\nor a book I'm going to go write the\nscrier which is uh specialty this is\nspecialty software writers used to write\nright I going to go right to a scrier\nproject and start putting these in the\nresearch section of that scrier project\nwhen I'm working on a math or computer\nscience thing I might work out proof\nideas on paper but I pretty quickly want\nto get that into a latch document so so\nthe markup language that you use for\ndoing sort of like applied math papers\nright the the the tool we use to\nactually write papers I'm going to move\nan idea into there as soon as I can I'm\ngoing to move proofs out of a notebook\nand into formally marked up like you\nwould for a paper you know as soon as I\nwould so this idea this just something\nI've been leaning to more is capture the\nnotes in the tool you're going to use\ntake out the middleman in some sense\nright so it's it's uh reducing friction\nbut also puts you in the right mind\nspace like okay this idea I'm going to\nput it where I'm going to need it later\nas opposed to a more elaborate\nthirdparty system that you construct\nthat you then later pull everything out\nof as needed uh this what I've been\ndoing more recently let's just get\nstraight to the tool I'm eventually\ngoing to use with maybe a high quality\nnotebook intermediary if I'm actually\nliterally working out thoughts so math\nyou have to work out thoughts but I'll\nget that into an actual paper format\npretty quickly tell me what you think of\num this what I always call protocol if I\nwant to learn something from a\nmanuscript I read or a book chapter yeah\nI used to highlight things and I had a\nvery elaborate um extracted from my\nUniversity days system of stars and\nexclamation marks and underline that\nmean a lot to me that can yes bring me\nback to a given segment within the\nchapter but a few years ago I was\nteaching a course in the biology\ndepartment at Stanford and for some\nreason we had them read a study about\ninformation retention\nand um and I learned from that study\nthat one of the best things we can do is\nread information um in whatever form a\nmagazine research article Etc book um\nand then to take some time away from\nthat material maybe walk maybe close\none's eyes maybe leave them open doesn't\nmatter and just try and remember\nspecific elements how much does one\nremember then go back to the material\nand look at it and I've just been um\npositively astonished at how much more\ninformation I can learn\nwhen I'm not simply going through motor\ncommands of just underlining things and\nhighlighting them but stepping away and\nthinking okay yeah they I don't oh I\ndon't remember how many subjects there\nwere I'll go back and check that maybe\nmake a note and okay they did this then\nthey did that and then like and then\nit's crystallized and and when as I say\nthis I realize of course this should\nwork this is the way that the brain\nlearns um but somehow that's not the way\nwe are taught to learn yeah well I'm\nsmiling because I when I was 22 uh I\nwrote this book called how to become a\nstraight A student right and the whole\npremise of the book was I'm going to\ntalk to actual college students who have\nstraight A's uh and who don't seem\ncompletely ground out right like not\nburnt out and I'm just going to\ninterview them right and the protocol\nwas uh how did you study for the last\ntest that you study for how did you take\nnotes for the life so I was just asking\nthem to walk through their methodology\nthe core idea of that book was active\nrecall that was the core idea that\nreplicating uh ideas way used to say is\nreplicating the information from scratch\nas if teaching a class without looking\nat your notes that is the only way to\nlearn and and the thing about it was\nit's a tradeoff uh it doesn't take it's\nefficient doesn't take much time but\nit's incredibly mentally taxing right\nthis is why students often avoid it it\nis difficult to sit there and try to\nreplicate and pull forth okay what did I\nread here how did that work it's it's\nmentally very taxing but it's very time\nefficient right if you're willing to\nessentially put up with that with that\npain um you learn very quickly and not\nonly do you learn very quickly you don't\nforget it's almost like you have a\npseudo photographic memory when you\nstudy this way you sit down to do a test\nand you're you're replicating like whole\nlines from like what you what you\nstudied I the ideas sort of come out\nfully formed because it's such a\nfantastic way to to actually learn um it\nwas my key like the whole premise that\ngot me writing that book is I went\nthrough this this period as a college\nstudent where where I came in freshman\nyear was like a fine student not a great\nstudent but a fine student and uh I was\nrowing crew and I was sort of like\nexcited to do that um and then I got\ndeveloped a heart condition and had to\nstop congenital wiring in the heart\natrial flutter thing mean I couldn't R\ncrew anymore is a prolapse of some sort\nit was a a a circuit a circuitry issue\nthat would lead to a extremely rapid\nheartbeat it's like U really rapid like\ntardia right you get two 250 beats a\nminute just and it could be exercise\ninduced right which is not optimal um\nyou could take beta blockers which would\nmoderate the electrical timing but beta\nblockers reduce your max heart rate and\nif you're a athlete where the entire\nthing that matters is your max heart\nrate so you're doing something like a\n2,000 meter rows your performance on\nbeta blockers just goes down it makes no\nsense it's like being a basketball\nplayer that wears weighted shoes it's\ntoo frustrating right it also makes you\nsuper mow I was pretty mellow guy but I\nwas a worse rower so um so I stopped\nthat I was like okay I want to get\nserious about my my studies I I I can\nget serious about my studies and writing\nright that's when I actually made the\ndecisions that I didn't stuck with for\nthe next 25 years after that but one of\nthe things I did to get serious about my\nstudies is I said I'm going to\nsystematically experiment with how to\nstudy for test and how to write papers\nand I had I would try this how did it go\ndeconstruct experiment try this how did\nit go deconstruct experiment and active\nrecall was the thing to turn me all\naround and so I went from a pretty good\nstudent to 40 every single quarter\nsophomore year junior year senior year I\ngot one a minus between my sophomore\nyear through my senior year it was like\nthis miraculous transformation it was\nactive recall I rebuilt all of my\nstudying so if it was for a humanities\nclass I had a whole way of taking notes\nit was all built around doing active\nrecall for math classes my main study\ntool was a stack of white paper all\nright do this proof white piece of paper\nand just can I do it from scratch if I\ncould I know that technique if I don't\nall right I'm gonna come back and try it\nagain later completely transformed you\nknow I did so well academically that's\nwhy I ended up writing that book that\nbasically spread that message to other\npeople so I'm a huge advocate for active\nrecall it's really hard but it is the\nway to learn new things I'd like to take\na brief moment and thank one of our\nsponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that also\ncontains adaptogens I started taking ag1\nway back in 2012 the reason I started\ntaking it and the reason I still take it\nevery day is that it ensures that I meet\nall of my quotas for vitamins and\nminerals and it ensures that I get\nenough Prebiotic and probiotic to\nsupport gut health now gut health is\nsomething that over the last 10 years we\nrealized is not just important for the\nhealth of our gut but also for our\nimmune system and for the production of\nneurotransmitters and neuromodulators\nthings like dopamine and serotonin in\nother words gut health is critical for\nproper brain functioning now of course I\nstrive to consume healthy Whole Foods\nfor the majority of my nutritional\nintake every single day but there are a\nnumber of things in ag1 including\nspecific micronutrients that are hard to\nget from Whole Foods or at least in\nsufficient quantities so AG G1 allows me\nto get the vitamins and minerals that I\nneed probiotics prebiotics the\nadaptogens and critical micronutrients\nso anytime somebody asks me if they were\nto take Just One supplement what that\nsupplement should be I tell them ag1\nbecause ag1 supports so many different\nsystems within the body that are\ninvolved in mental health physical\nhealth and performance to try ag1 go to\ndrink a1.com huberman and you'll get a\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five\nfree travel packs of ag1 again that's a\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman and as you pointed out it is\nvery time efficient oh yeah yeah I mean\nit was a problem it was a social problem\nfor me that I would have to pretend\nduring finals period that I was going to\nthe library to study because I would be\ndone studying this active recall it's\nbrutal but it's incredibly efficient you\nsit down there I would have my cards I\nwould mark it okay I struggled with this\nI'd put it in this pile I got it done\nI'd put it in this pile and so then you\nwould just go back to the I struggled\nwith it pile uh and work on that and\nthen make a new I struggle with a pile\nand these would exponentially Decay and\nso in like a few hours you could really\nMaster you know with a few other tricks\nthat worked you could really Master the\nmaterial pretty quickly and then what am\nI supposed to do I didn't do all\nnighters like it wouldn't make any sense\nlike active recall is how you prepare\nit's going to take four hours and it's\ngoing to be tough so do it in the\nmorning when you have energy and then\nyou're done I love it I learned\nessentially all of neuroanatomy looking\ndown the microscope at tissue samples\nand then I would try and take\nphotographs with my eyes I do not have a\nphotographic memory but then I would get\nhome in the evening look through the\nneuro Anatomy textbook lie down and try\nand fly through the different circuits\nin my mind and then if I arrived at a\nstructure in the brain that I couldn't\nidentify I would then go check my notes\nand go back so I just so basically I\nlearned neur Anatomy which I you know um\nI'm poor at a great many things in life\nbut neur Anatomy I'm I'm I'm solid at um\nwith and then some if I may say so and\nit's because there's a mental map move\nthrough it you know fly through it\ndynamically um and that it's the same\nprocess um not all things lend\nthemselves to that approach um I'm\nguessing maybe we could think of a few\nthat don't um I guess if people were\nlearning music yeah um that might be\ntricky maybe they need the sheet music\nin front of them I don't know I'm not a\nmusician yeah I mean I studied a a\nprofessional guitar player at one point\nyou were a professional guitar I studied\none oh so for for a book everything's\nfrom some book I've written a lot of\nbooks I wrote a book 10 years ago um\nwhere I was trying to figure out as part\nof it how to people get better at things\nand so I spent time with a professional\nguitar player that said I just wanted to\nsee how he practiced like what does this\nactually look like and what I learned\nfrom them is like what they do is yeah\nthey have the music in front of them but\nfor them it's all speed so they take a\npiece he was working on licks for he was\na new acoustic style player and they had\nthese kind of blueg grassy type licks um\nand he probably had it memorized and he\nknew how fast he could comfortably play\nit for them it's all about adding 20% to\nwhat they're comfortably doing and then\nthat that that push passed where they're\ncomfortable and the thing I remember\nwriting about him was he was\nconcentrating so hard to try to hit this\nlick 20% faster than he was used to it\nis he'd forget to breathe so he'd be\nlike going going going and then just\ngasp you know like because his body\nwould you know force them force them to\nbreathe so yeah there it seemed to be\nall about uh deliberate practice so like\nhow do you they don't waste any time\nprofessional musicians waste no time\ndoing things they're comfortable doing\nevery time they spend practicing and\nthis is also incredibly difficult uh but\nevery time they been practicing it's\nalmost entirely in a a state of I'm not\ncomfortable with this but if I focus as\nhard as I can maybe I'm G to pull this\noff like I'll pull off the Sonata at\nthis new speed I'm trying to do maybe\nI'll pull it off it's like the maximal\ngrowth stimulating State uh and so I\nwrote in the in this chapter why was he\nso much better at Guitar than I was at\nthe same age because I played a lot of\nguitar when I was younger and was in\nrock bands right and this kid was young\nright right but really really good and I\nsaid okay now I realize it I can\nrecognize me when I look back at my time\nplaying guitar at his age I played stuff\nI knew how to play like that's what was\nfun like yeah I want to like jam along\nwith the songs I knew or you know rip\nsome pentatonic scales you know to like\na jimmi Hendrick album uh it was fun and\nhe spent almost no time the pro spent no\ntime having fun practicing was your\nbrain had to be you know uncomfortable\nso I learned a lot from that you know um\nthis actually led to a bit of a battle\nbecause of my my readers there was this\nuh a this battle that emerged where\npeople were trying to combine Andre\nEricson in deliberate practice with uh\nMaley chmi and Flo and really they were\ntrying to make flow apply everywhere\nlike it's all about flow uh deliberate\npractice is flow everything is flow the\nwhole thing is to get into a state of\nflow and I remember Anders talking about\nthis at some point and say like no no no\nlike the state of practice that makes\nyou better it's the opposite of flow\nright in flow you lose track of time\nwhen you're practicing like that\nprofessional guitar player you know\nevery second it passes by because it's\nlike incredibly difficult like what\nyou're doing your mind is rebelling it's\nnot natural you know it's not fun it's\nnot the skier going down the the hill\nand it's all Instinct it's you it's all\nyou thinking about exactly what you're\ntrying to do and so you know I began to\npush this point out here is like it's\nnot all about flow like actually getting\nbetter at things is really painful\nsometimes deliberate practice is not the\nsame as flow and there's a lot of fights\nabout this for a while I think there was\na lot of flow Advocates that just wanted\nlife to be flow all the time but I think\nAnders was right because I watched these\nprofessionals practice like that's what\nit is it's not fun well everything we\nknow about neuroplasticity which of\ncourse is the nervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience says\nthat there needs to be some\nneurochemical or electrical condition\nthat changes in the nervous system in\norder to queue up plasticity and um to\nmy knowledge one of of the most um\nrobust of those is the release of the\nso-called catac colomines dopamine\nepinephrine norepinephrine um dopamine\nbecause it's involved in so many things\nuh can be a little bit of a distractor\nso let's just say epinephrine\nnorepinephrine adrenaline nor adrenaline\nit create in the body and mind to some\nextent a state of alertness and often a\nstate of agitation but if you think\nabout it in the absence of some\nneuromodulators like those yeah um that\nchange the conditions for wiring of\nneurons you know everyone loves fire\ntogether wire together yeah beautiful\nstatement by Carla shatz not Donald Hebb\nDr Carla shat said that not Donald Hebb\num but why would neurons need to change\ntheir patterns of connectivity if you\ncan complete the operation the nervous\nsystem needs to um it doesn't feel\ndiscomfort it creates discomfort but the\nnervous system needs a cue to that okay\nthis is different I'm failing and it's\nthe failures that actually trigger the\nplasticity it's the discomfort that cues\nthat conditions are different different\nnow otherwise there's simply no reason\nto devote energetic resources to\nrewiring neurons and I feel like we\ndon't learn this when we're kids we um\nand I think as kids we can learn so much\nwithout that feeling of agitation we get\ninto these modes of looking for flow and\num I have respect for the the research\non Flow and the people Bal in but I'd\nlike to talk about flow a little bit the\nonly thing I really know about flow for\nsure is that backwards it spells wolf so\num one of flow it's such an attractive\nidea right it's like Star Wars like you\nhave the force and you're kind you're\ndoing things without thinking and um\nawesome but I can't flow myself through\na paper Y and extract the critical data\nI can't create a podcast in flow but\nwhen it's done it feels great especially\nif you nail the the key metrics so what\ndo you think about flow let's I'm not\ntrying to beat up on it I just want to\nunderstand how how you place it in the\nframework of learning and and deep work\nif it belongs there at all it doesn't\nhave a big place in it in the Deep work\nframework and and this was what the\ncontroversy was for a while and and I I\nknew mahaley a little bit like we we\ncorresponded some and I knew Andre a\nlittle bit like we corresponded some so\nI sort of felt like I was um you know\nand and both of them actually tragically\nhave died in the last three or four\nyears I think oh that's very sad yeah I\nthink both recently um Flo doesn't play\na big role in the Deep the Deep work\nframework right so so when I was trying\nto justify deep work so why why focusing\nwithout distraction was important I was\ndrawing a lot more for and's work right\nbecause uh why is focusing without\ndistraction important well you have to\nquiet the neural circuitry so you can\nisolate the circuit that's actually\nrelevant to the thing that you're doing\nright you're not going to get better at\nsomething if you have noisy circuitry\nthis is and that requires uh really\nintense concentration so is one of the\nbig advantages of deep work was if\nyou're used to that cognitive State\nyou're going to learn things faster and\nI think it was all Anders to understand\nwhy so if you're not distracted I'm\nreally focusing hard on what I'm doing\ntrying to learn this new thing\nyou're giving the right mental\nconditions but it's not a flow State I\nalways used to say okay when your when\nyour deep work is not flow because of\nthis like a lot of deep work is you're\ntrying to do something that is beyond\nyour comfort zone and that's going to be\ndifficult that's a state of deliberate\npractice and there's a famous paper\nabout this where Anders uh actually\nexplicitly says deliberate practice and\nflow are very different and and I wrote\nan essay years ago called the father of\ndeliberate practice disowns flow and\nagain people are really flow partisans\nout there it's interesting I think\npeople just like the idea because it\nfeels good but I mean flow is the\nfeeling of performance is the way I\nthink about it like it's really hard to\ntrain for certain sports but then when\nyou're actually performing you're in the\ngame you can fall in the flow right\nbecause then everything is undo it's\nreally hard to train guitar but like\nwhen you're performing in front of a big\ncrowd you probably maybe you fall in the\nflow maybe you don't but you could right\nbut it's the performance State not the\npracticing getting better state so you\nknow to Me Flo has like very little role\nin how I think about what I do as a\ncognitive professional it's just not\nsomething that comes up that\noften I agree um that we learn through\nfocused work and that uh flow does um\nmanifest itself during performance and\nsometimes um so much so that people\nexhibit virtuosity they're surprising\nthemselves even what what's in there and\nthat's kind of I always think of it's a\nwhat is unskilled skilled Mastery\nvirtuosity virtuosity seems to\nincorporate some sort random elements of\nmaybe even the performer has not done\nthat before and they surprise themselves\nor something like that who knows these\nare these are words for um for something\nthat uh isn't easily Quantified in the\nfirst place but in terms of deep work\nand getting um a little bit back to kind\nof practical steps towards steep work I\nalso have to ask you because I didn't uh\nearlier when you are on your laptop in\nyour library with your fireplace and\nthese books it's a beautiful image\nactually that you've drawn for us in our\nminds um is the Wi-Fi connection to your\ncomputer activated or are you offline uh\nit's connected um because it doesn't\nreally matter to me you know because\nwhat what is what's drawing my attention\num I mean the most important decision I\nthink I made technically speaking to be\na cognitive worker is I the lack of\nsocial media like I I I think we\nunderestimate the degree to which our\nproblem with digital distraction is not\nthe Internet it's not our phones it is\nspecific products and services that are\nengineered at Great expense they pull\nyou back to them when you take that away\nthe internet's not that interesting like\nI don't have a cycle of sites to go to\nyou know I can check my email but I\ndon't really know where else to go I\nmean I could go to the New York Times I\nguess but then you've seen the Articles\nright they they change it once a day\nthere's just not much I've set things up\nso there's not much that's that\ninteresting to\nme we've all heard of fomo fear of\nmissing out I feel like there's the\nother thing which is um fear of missing\nsomething bad right sort of like an\nanxiety a more primitive anxiety within\nus that if we are not engaged on social\nmedia or looking at our phone often or\ntexting often that it's not that we'll\nmiss the party um we'll miss the\nemergency um you don't seem to suffer\nfrom those kind of everyday ills yeah I\nmean it doesn't happen that much I mean\nI have a phone you know a a standard I\nmean I have my phone I guess if I'm\nworking away from it yeah I guess it's\ntrue if there was an\nemergency uh but this was the case for\nlong time right we didn't have\nsmartphones till really relatively\nrecently this is you know 15 years ago\nso we were just used to this until\nyesterday essentially that there's just\nperiods of time where you're you're out\nof touch like you're at a restaurant\nwith someone you're out of touch until\nyou get back to your office like we were\nokay you know we weren't plagued by\nemergencies that that uh led to\ndisastrous results because we couldn't\nhear about it right then you go to the\nmovies like you're out of touch right\nand be a couple hours till you're in\ntouch again and so I don't you know it's\nnot something that's affected me as much\nso maybe I'm working without my phone\nnearby a lot of people have this\nresponse they begin sort of\ncatastrophizing like what if this\nhappens or this or that and I'm thinking\nyou know uh I survived before that my\nparents survived without that my my\ngrandparents survived without that um I\ndon't worry about it as much you know\nand and some of this maybe is just this\ndoesn't upset people as as much as it\nused to the fact I don't use a lot of\nthese apps or have my phone um but it\nreally does upset people right there's\nwhat about this what about that what\nabout this and I don't know how much of\nthis is just maybe I'm oblivious and how\nmuch of this is people back sliding\nexplanation for why they do need their\nphone why they do need to look at all\nthe time but I I get a lot of it yeah\nwell maybe they're upset and you don't\nknow because you're not looking at your\nphone that's right hey I'll tell you\nwhat that's a blessing not knowing how\nupset people are at you yeah it's a\nblessing as a semi-public figure I'll\ntell you that uh yeah I can comment on\nthat but I won't um I am on social media\nand um I do enjoy it as I've got started\nposting on Instagram and then expanded\nto other platforms including the the\npodcast but there's a threshold Beyond\nwhich it becomes counterproductive for\nsure um I think there's information\nthere um that like questions that people\nask are often informative it's sort of\nlike ending a class and asking are there\nany questions sometimes the comments\nthat people bring back are truly\ninformative towards both where they\nmight have some misunderstanding but\nalso sometimes some really terrific\nideas yeah um so there's that but I I\ncompletely agree that this is a a very\nuh precarious space um and I'll just\nrelay a quick anecdote years ago I gave\na quick lecture um down at Santa clar\nUniversity south of Stanford and I was\ntalking about this issue I recommended\nyour book and a student came up\nafterwards and he said you don't get it\nat that time I was in my early 40s he\nsaid you don't get it you know you grew\nup without social media and the phone\nand so you've adopted it into your life\nbut we grew up with it and when my phone\nhe's speaking for himself in the first\nperson when my phone loses power I feel\na physical drain Within in my body and\nwhen it comes back on I feel a lift\nwithin my body so I I'd love your\nthoughts on whether or not you think the\nphone and perhaps social media as well\nare in some ways an extension of our\nbrain it's almost like another cortical\narea that contains all this information\nit's sort it's a version of us this gets\ninto Notions of AI that we can talk\nabout as well I know you're involved in\nin Ai and writing about AI but you know\nto me the when the phone is used in that\nway um it really is a almost like a\nuh a piece of neural Machinery of sorts\nyeah I mean there's two ways of looking\nat it yeah so there is the the sort of\ncyborg image I suppose right like you\nare you're extending you're you're\nplugging into this neosphere like you\nhave this sort of digital Network\nextension of information and what's\ngoing on there's also the much more\npessimistic view which is no no that\nfeeling is the feeling of a moderate\nbehavioral addiction right so you you\nyou'll hear the same thing from a a\ngambler I really when I'm away from\nbeing a ble to to play right to make my\nbets or do whatever like I feel really\nif I feel not myself and then when I'm\nwhen I'm around it and I can play make\nsome bets play some poke or whatever it\nis feeling of the chips I feel I feel\nmyself that chips right like they would\nsay so there it could be both of these\nthings could be true I think the\nmoderate behavioral addiction side is is\nmore true than than a lot of us want to\nadmit actually like it it does feel bad\nbecause moderate behavioral addictions\nbuild these these feedback response\nloops and then you get the dopamine\nsystem going when the anticipation\nbecause what's on there is things that\nhave been engineered that you're going\nto get this sort of Highly engaging\nstimuli and then you see the Deliverance\nof that stimuli right this really nice\npiece of glass on a piece of metal I'm\ngoing to press this sort of carefully uh\nthis icon whose colors have been chosen\nbecause we know it's going to hit\nvarious parts of our neural alert\nsystems to be as engaging as possible um\nand I'm going to see something in there\nthat's going to generate some sort of\nemotional response so of course when you\nsee that thing sitting there you want to\nuse it and when you can't it's a a\nstying dopamine response you're like\nthis this is not good I'm uncomfortable\nand I I think that's a big part of it as\nwell um because I've had this you know\nI've had this argument with with some\npeople and I by the way I see both sides\nof this like there there are great\nadvantages to what people are doing with\nthese tools it's just that it's all\nmixed up with all these disadvantages\nand it becomes very difficult it's like\nthe alcohol in the neighborhood bar is\ntoo potent you know and and people are\ngoing there to socialize and they're\ncoming home at 3 in the morning you know\nuh passing out you know it's like the\nbalance is off not that there's not\nsomething good there but the balance is\noff so it becomes pretty difficult to\nnavigate so I think some of that's\nwhat's going on especially with the\nyounger generation that was raised on it\nwhich is why by the way I think the\ncultural norms are going to change\naround this I think we're going to think\nabout unrestricted internet usage not as\nsomething that we just sort of bequeath\non youth as they become 10 years old but\nsomething that we're actually much more\ncareful about uh probably something\nthat's going to be post pubescent is\ngoing to make a lot more sense once\nyou've had more brain development once\nyou've had more uh social entrenchment\nyou sort of understand your identity Etc\nbecause we recognize you know the the\nflip side of plugging this thing into\nyour brain is yeah you have access to\nmore information but it also pumps that\ninto your brain so I don't know I I lean\na little bit heavier towards the\npessimistic read because I know too many\npeople because of my books um who've\nreally reduced the impact of these\nthings in their lives and they don't on\nthe far side of that transformation they\ndon't typically report a great\nimpoverishment and experence experience\nthey don't report\num I'm less mentally agile the\ninformation at my fingertips is less I\nI'm I'm missing out on life there's\ntypically this coming out of the fog on\nthe other side of it where they're like\noh this is fine so you know I'm a little\nbit suspicious about exactly what this\nmechanism is I think you're right about\nthe um moderate behavioral addiction\npiece years ago when I was starting my\nlab I had grants to write and I found\nthe phone to be pretty intrusive for\nthat process so I used to give the phone\nto somebody in my lab and announc to\neveryone in my lab that if I asked asked\nfor it back prior to 5:00 p.m. that day\nI would give everyone in the lab I think\nit was a $100 bill my lab was pretty big\nat the time I was a junior Professor\nthey did not do not sorry uh academic\ninstitutions not to be named um pay us\nvery much despite what people might\nthink and um and it was difficult\nseveral times throughout the day or more\nI was like I really want to look at that\nthing but the end of the day um I'll\ntell you that no one got paid I got my\nphone back but it's wonderful the amount\nof work that you can get done when that\nthing is out of the room I mean it's my\nit's my super hour right I don't work\nthat hard in the sense that I don't do\nlong hours like I'm not constitutionally\nsuited for long hours this was never my\nthing uh my brain tires right I mean I'm\ngood for four four and a half good hours\na day of actually producing good stuff\nwith my brain probably Max but you know\nI don't use my phone that much I don't\nuse the internet that much and I\nprioritize it and a lot just gets done\nit just sort of piles up over time you\nknow and there's this sense of like you\nmust be burning the midnight oil and you\nhave all these things going on uh but\nagain people I think underestimate and\nit's not the uh they underestimate the\nimpact of this it's not just the the\naccumulation of time you spend looking\non your phone it's also this network\nswitching cost right because like the\nphone is very good at inducing a network\nswitch and that's an expensive timec\nconsuming energy consuming neuronal\noperation task switching I'm going to\nswitch my focus of attention from this\nto that like we can't do that in two\nseconds right that's a hard process it\ntakes a while it's why when you sit down\nto work on something really hard you\nhave that feeling of for the first 15\nminutes this is terrible you know and\nthen after like 15 or 20 minutes you\nsort of get into the groove I always\nassumed part of what's going on is it\ntakes a while for your brain to really\nstart marshalling okay so what semantic\nnetworks do we need to start activating\nhere oh we don't need this let's inhibit\nthis we're not doing that anymore it\ntakes a while um so what happens then\nwhen you have a lot of these quick\nchecks to social media you're jumping in\non email back and forth is you have this\ndisaster catastrophic pile up of aborted\ntask switches happening right and so\nit's not just the total time you're\nlooking at let's say email or social\nmedia it's the 15minute window you have\nto add around each of those checks in\nwhich you have this cognitive disorder\nthat really adds up and then you realize\noh there was no time during my day in\nwhich I was more than 15 minutes away\nfrom looking at something that induced a\nnetwork switch the the data I like to\nsite which was looking at email and\nslack checks and knowledge workers this\ncame from Rescue time the software\ncompany the\nmedian average interval between checks\nwas 5 minutes it's the median and the\nmode was one minute in this data set so\nit was like we are we are checking all\nthe time that means you were never in a\nstate then in your day where you don't\nhave a confused cognitive space where\nyou don't have partially you were\nswitching to this task but then you\nswitch back to this task before that\nfinish but before you could fully lock\nin on this task you look back over here\nand so you're spending your entire day\nin the state of cognitive disorder which\nis going to be reduced cognitive output\nright so you get rid of that I mean I\nalways say like one of my advantages is\nnot that I'm doing anything smarter I'm\njust avoiding sometimes the dumb thing\njust holding slowing other people down\nyou get rid of that and you feel like\nyou're on the world's best uh\nneurotropic or something like this like\noh I'm just doing this thing and I'm\ndoing it pretty well now I'm done you\nwhy this didn't even take that long so I\nmean I I think people underestimate\nwhat's going on here I'd like to take a\nquick break to acknowledge our sponsor\nelement element is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need and nothing\nyou don't that means zero sugar and the\nappropriate ratios of the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and that\ncorrect ratio of electrolytes is\nextremely important because every cell\nin your body but especially your nerve\ncells your neurons relies on\nelectrolytes in order to function\nproperly so when you're well hydrated\nand you have the appropriate amount of\nelectrolytes in your system your mental\nfunctioning and your physical\nfunctioning is improved I drink one\npacket of element dissolved in about 16\nto 32 ounces of water when I wake up in\nthe morning as well as while I exercise\nand if I've sweat a lot during that\nexercise I often will drink a third\nelement packet dissolved in about 32\nounces of water after I exercise element\ncomes in a variety of different flavors\nall of which I find really tasty I like\nthe Citrus I like the watermelon I like\nthe raspberry frankly I can't pick just\none it also comes in chocolate and\nchocolate mint which I find tastes best\nif they are put into water dissolved and\nthen heated up I tend to do that in the\nwinter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydr on hot days and in\nthe summer and spring months but also in\nthe winter when the temperatures are\ncold and the environment tends to be dry\nif you'd like to try element you can go\nto drink element spelled\nel.com huberman to try a free sample\npack again that's drink element.com\nhuberman yeah would like to drill into\nthe concept of context and task\nswitching a bit more uh I do think that\nthe brain has something akin to a\ntransmission system system where you\nknow for people that drive and have\ndriven you know the the amount of energy\nthat needs to be used in order to\naccelerate a vehicle to get up to a you\nknow higher gear it's very different\nthan the um equal amount of increase in\nspeed at a given gear right so it's sort\nof the this is you hear this if you're\nnot familiar with transmission say it\nsounds\nlike it sounds as if there's it's more\nfasile at at higher speeds well how\ncould it be that you're burning less\nfuel at a higher speed it's not exactly\nthat way but but I think the brain has\nthese sort of transmission systems and\nwhat you're describing with um people\nswitching back and forth and checking\nemail and phone Etc and back to the work\num that should be at hand is sort of\nakin to going up and down the the gear\nsystem constantly yeah trying to arrive\nat a given destination and sure you\nmight arrive but you're going to burn\nfar more fuel it's the least efficient\nway to go about it you want to get into\nthat deep Groove and I think when we\nhear about flow I feel like at least for\nme that's the sort of notion of flow\nthat I'm looking for or dropping into\nthat deep Groove even if there's some\nfriction within that groove of the the\nchallenge of the work that I'm doing\nit's about not thinking about anything\nelse it's really about Focus yep right\nand the word flow is just a wonderfully\nattractive word um that I think gives us\nthe the false impression that we can\njust drop into things like a square wave\nfunction sit down pen and paper go and\nthere's no possible way that neural\ncircuits could work that way no we let's\nlet's invent the term and I'm you tell\nme if the term makes sense I'm invent on\nthe fly but uh neuros semantic coherence\nthis is going to be my alternative term\nfor flow when you're working on\nsomething hard um it's not that you're\nin an actual Flow State where you lose\ntrack of what you're doing you're\nconcentrating really hard but I'm why\nI'm saying neuros semantic coherence is\nyou get to this place where the sort of\nrelevant semantic neural networks are\nall um those that are activated are all\nrelevant to what you're doing and you've\nuh over time inhibited most of the\nunrelated networks that were fired up\nbefore and so you get in this sense of\nit's hard\nmaybe I'm not losing track of time but\nlike I'm all focused on this you know\nI'm grappling with the the the bear here\nthe the math equation the book chapter\nwhatever it is um and so it's something\ndifferent than flow but it's also\ndifferent than Linda Stone had the term\npartial continuous attention which is\nwhat you're that cognitive disaster of\nI'm constantly Network switching back\nand forth so we'll call it neuros\nsemantic coherence I'm going to coin\nthat term um because it's uh you have\nthis coherence of the semantic neural\nnetworks on what you're doing and that's\nthe feeling of I'm getting after this\nhard problem and it might be really hard\nto do I mean I know the feeling of\ntrying to solve a math proof for me for\nexample could be so difficult because I\nmean what does it actually feel like in\nyour head when you're solving a math\nproof it's a lot of you hold this here\nand then you try to get to the next step\nby doing this and it doesn't work but\nyou have to keep holding this here which\ntakes a lot of concentration okay let me\ntry this that didn't work either but\nthis looked promising okay so now I need\nto go back and in my mind's eye update\nthis setup and now let me try this so\nit's a lot of holding things in your\nworking memory um and keeping them\nloaded while you try an extension and\nthen evaluating how that work without\nand so it requires um just internal\nconcentration which isn't pleasant but\nin neuros semantic coherence it's all\nthat's happening in your world you know\nis that in that proof so maybe that's\nwhat we should be pitching what people\nshould be looking for is yeah forget\nflow but also remember like this default\nwhere you're like the rescue time data\nset participants checking email once\nevery 5 minutes that's cognitive\nnonsense\nthat's crazy that's like you're trying\nto you know play football and you're\ncovering over one of your eyes and\nwearing like a 50 pound ruck sack on\nyou're just like handicapping your\nabilities here for no reason right so\nwhat's in between is this idea and that\nrequires Focus you know it requires deep\nwork yeah we're playing football and\nthen um every three Downs or so running\ninto the stands and having a\nconversation trying to work out\nsomething challenging with your spouse\nor whatever then going back and trying a\ntotally different play set right um at\nrisk of throwing too different too many\nanalogies and and stories I'll just\nbriefly say I went and saw the the play\nin New York with my sister this year I\nthink it was Harry Potter and the cursed\nchild or something like that um I didn't\nreally enjoy the play that much but the\nset stuff was amazing and they had this\nmagic Library I think is very very\nrelevant here where essentially um the\nbook that you open um has a certain\ntopic I don't know maybe it's spells or\nsomething as Harry Potter again uh fun\nshow but great set stuff didn't didn't\nreally resonate with me too much in any\nevent and then the book around it change\ntheir topic that but are related to that\nCentral book interesting and then if you\nlook at one particular thing like maybe\nit's potions or something I'm making\nthis up and then all of a sudden the\nbooks the books around it change they\nbecome either more specific there might\nbe a distant but related idea that could\nlend itself to creativity so sort of\nthat's the way the brain works in\ncognition is that we get into a frame of\nof a certain discussion or a certain\ntheme and and the and the the books on\nthe Shelf change according to their\nrelatedness based on memory of past\nwhat's going on now and plans for the\nfuture I think anytime we look at uh we\nchange context and we look at you know a\nraccoon video on Instagram or our\ncalendar and oh there's that thing the\nbooks become very scattered so when we\nreturn to it there's a lot more friction\nuh a lot more work or neural neural\nenergy required to get back into that um\nthis uh narrow states of cognition does\nthat exactly explain sort of my\nexperience and the way I think about it\nyeah yeah because you're it takes time\nuh to to load up the these sort of\nrelevant these secondary and tertiary\nsemantic ideas and now they're there so\nlike you can pull from them and then as\nyou shift you have to sort of shift this\nwhole thing around that takes a lot of\nconcentration I mean I I wrote this this\narticle once that got me a little bit of\ntrouble not not trouble but mild trouble\nuh but it was it was called was for the\nChronicle of Higher Education um and the\ntitle they gave it was is email making\nProfessor stupid which wasn't my title\nyou basically called every every one of\nyour colleagues stupid we all check\nemail the dean at the time did call me\nin for lunch but actually he was here's\nthe thing he was like hey this is real I\nagree with this um um but what I was\narguing actually in that article\nessentially was what do we do at a\nuniversity is is partially what we're\nsupposed to be doing is trying to teach\nwhat the life of the mind is and how\nthat works and we've kind of forgotten\nthat so what we should maybe think about\nlike at universities we need to be\nexplicitly not just teaching how to\nthink but also modeling the life of the\nmind at the at the highest level and so\nthis idea that we just allow the the\nprofessor serot to to be drowned and um\nemails and and uh tasks and being\ndistracted you know it's the main war\nthat every research Professor has is how\ndo I how do I fight the admin overload\nuntil I become famous enough to get an\nassistant right like this is the big\nproblem and I was making this proposal\nof University should be the citadel's a\nconcentration I said if you want to get\nthe the best academics in the world to\nyour University just tell them uh here's\nat the top of our contract you will not\nbe assigned an email address like you're\ngoing to get Nobel laurates coming from\nyou know all over the country to come to\nthis place and so I was making this argu\nargument um we should think a lot more\nabout thinking we should talk more about\nit we should model it exactly the type\nof things you're talking about um but we\ndon't it's much more content Focus but\nreally this should be something more\nthat we we get into specifically like\nthis is how you actually use the mind to\nproduce Innovative uh interesting high\nvalue new cognitive artifacts this is a\nvery hard thing we're asking you to do\num but you can Apprentice here because\nthis is what we do and we've mastered\nwe're going to teach you how to do it uh\nbut we never have that sort of meta\nconversation sort of metacognition\nconversation I've always thought that'd\nbe important I think you'd have much\nbetter outcomes if that's part of what\nyou learned at the University was how to\ntake the thing in your head and really\nput it to work you know really extract\nout of it his capabilities or even high\nschool or even Elementary School level I\nagree you U you have kids yeah um do\nthey have smartphones no yeah how do\nthey feel about that well I mean they're\nnot they're not old enough yet that it's\na it's a real problem um but they're\nthey're not going to be having happy\nwith me probably soon hate me now love\nme later as my mother used to say\nbasically because I you know I'm I'm\nconvinced having spent some time\nthinking about this writing about this\ndoing some journalism on this talking to\na lot of the experts that like I think\nwhere we're going to end up where all\nthe the arrows from the the relevant\nsocial psych research which um I've been\nfollowing This research since you know\n2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you\nsee the first warning signs going up\nthat we need to worry about the\npotential mental health impact of these\ntools especially social media and\nsmartphones on young people and I you\ncan track this right I have a talk I I\nactually gave it my kids school not\nhappy about this where I tracked how\nthis research evolved and you know like\nany literatures it's contentious at\nfirst and then you see um you you begin\nto see uh consilience between different\nlines of evidence and I think where\nwhere everything now in the last couple\nyears is starting to come together this\nidea of we don't really know if this is\nbad or not I think that's just an old\ntake the researchers mooved past that\nand I think where we're we're landing on\nis unrestricted internet use pre-puberty\nis risky and like the new standard is\ngoing to be uh post puberty is probably\nthe right time to be given a device that\ngives you unrestricted access we're\ntalking like 16 is probably the\nappropriate age so this does not make me\npopular at the middle school where my\nson's my oldest son's about to go um I\nthink in two or three years that's just\ngoing to be common sense this is the\ndirection I see the research literature\nand the advocacy going and I think\nthere's a solid ground for this\nbecause you're a computer scientist I\ncan ask this question what about video\ngames I'm not a big consumer of video\ngames it's been years since I've played\none in fact um but video games are so\nvery different than smartphones and um\nand other Technologies because they uh\nseem to put at least the kids I've\nobserved playing them and adults um into\na very narrow uh trench of attention\nyeah uh I mean there are definitely\nissues with it I mean look I'm not a\nsocial psychologist I just sort of play\none in my articles but but I've I've\nlooked into this literature a lot um\nthere's a bit of a a gendered breakdown\nthat has a lot of overlaps where when\nthey're looking at potential harms of\nthese Technologies uh young adolescence\nright pre-adolescent young adolescence\nyou tenden see social media to be more a\nsignal for cognitive distress for young\nwomen and girls and the video games to\nactually be the bigger culprit for uh\nyoung men and boys right there is a bit\nof a difference here because with the\nthe social media impact the the content\nof what's Happening matters in this\npicture right so so um what I'm seeing\nthe engagement I'm having how this\nimpacts my social life this is part of\nthe mental distress with video games it\nseems to be more uh an impact of just\ndisharmonious passion and Obsession just\nthe time it takes right because the\ngames can be incredibly addictive so the\nproblem that young men are having are\njust they're playing it all the time\nthat I'm staying up late because I have\nan iPad in my room and I'm 14 and I\ngoing to play fortnite until 3: in the\nmorning morning because my brain cannot\nhandle like what you're what you're\ngiving me here right um so it's less of\na a Content concern than it is just a\nTime concern right that seems more\nsolvable to me you know like my solution\nwith my own kids I don't mind video\ngames I'm a computer scientist but I\nsaid nothing that'ss online right\nnothing that was free because if it was\nfree that means uh their business model\ninvolves getting you to play it all the\ntime so you can upch charge or whatever\nuh they have Nintendo switches like I\nlike Nintendo okay Nintendo switch\nhere's a $60 Zelda game that someone\nspent 5 years making or whatever you can\nonly play those games so long at a time\nbefore you know you're tired you come\nback to it um they don't have an\naddictive response to it if they get an\niPad with a a game on it they'll just\nlike play that till their eyes bleed\nbecause those are meant to be to be\naddictive so I'm wary about video games\nbut there it's all just a usage game so\nyou stick away from the more addictive\ngames it's it's a much easier problem to\nsolve I think than the social media the\nsocial media issue earlier you talked\nabout books um I still read um hard\ncover and paperback books um what are\nyour thoughts on audiobooks and learning\nby way of um audio book uh versus paper\nin front of you flipping a physical\ndevice or Kindles I don't know if\nthere's any real research on this I've\nseen a little bit but I'm curious what\nwhat you've encountered and what your\nthoughts are as well you could speculate\nyeah I mean I'll tell you personally I\ncan only do fiction in audiobooks right\nbecause when I'm in a non-fiction\nexperience I'm just very used to\nconstantly looking for connections and\nideas you know and so I to be able to\nslow down and then speed up and then go\nback to something I just read um so I\nreally have a distressing experience\ntrying to listen to non-fiction\naudiobooks Fiction's fine that's great\nlet put a thriller on you know audible\ngreat I you know I'll listen through it\nand I think some of this might be\nparticular to my my engagement with\nbooks which is I'm you know I'm a writer\nand a thinker so I'm constantly looking\nfor ideas and so I might have a\ndifferent engagement with a non-fiction\nbook than someone you know just\nlistening to one of my books but I can\nonly do fiction on audio that makes\nsense thinking about what works for me\nwhat doesn't I agree I I love stories\nand fiction by by audiobook um you\nideally consumed on a long drive or a\nhike um but non-fiction requires that I\ntake notes and see things in their kind\nof um respective spatial layout and yeah\num in your most recent book um you\ndescrib this concept of pseudo\nproductivity is pseudo productivity a\ngeneral term term to refer to some of\nthe things we've already talked about\nthis Tas switching context switching or\npseudo productivity something that uh\nincludes other categories of of limiting\nourselves as well I mean I think it's\nmore specific than that right so it to\nme sud productivity was the answer that\nwe came up with a knowledge work to a\nreal dilemma which is that's a sector\nyou know using your brain primarily to\ncreate value that's a sector that\nemerged as a major part of the economy\nin roughly the mid 20th centur\num when that emerged all the definitions\nof productivity that we had were\ninspired from Agriculture and Industry\nright so so in agriculture we can have\nratios um bushels of corn per whatever\nacres of land under cultivation and\nIndustrial manufactur we have ratios\nmodeles per input labor hour um so you\ncould just measure these things uh we\nalso had clearly defined systems of\nproduction so you could then say if I\nchange this about the system of\nproduction what happens to this number\nand you could do gradient to Cent right\nokay I do this that number goes down\nlet's not do that but I make this change\nit goes up that's a better way of\nbuilding it like this was the dominant\nway of thinking about productivity since\nbasically Adam Smith the knowledge work\narises that doesn't work right because\nI'm working on whatever five different\nthings it's different than what you are\nworking on um how I'm managing my work\nis entirely ausc right in knowledge work\nuh organizational ideas is entirely left\nup to the individual how you manage your\nwork and your workload and collaboration\nthat's like up to you that's all off you\nskated there's no number to measure\nthere's no system to improve so I think\nit was a real quandry my argument is\nwhat essentially the management class\ncame up with is p productivity which is\nokay in the absence of being able to be\nquantitative about this we will use\nvisible activity as a proxy for useful\neffort so that's it like we see you\ndoing things that's better than not the\nmore we see you doing the better I call\nthat pseudo productivity and I think\nthat's implicitly how we've been\norganizing the management of knowledge\nwork labor since the\n1950s and when you say ability at people\ndoing things this is the um conflating\nof busyness with actual productivity yes\nand so the problem came when we had this\nuh General way of measuring\napproximating productive effort which\nwasn't very good but whatever right I\nmean I want to see you're at the office\nand you're doing things the problem was\nthe front office it Revolution right\nbecause I'm I'm essentially a techn\nCritic I see everything through the lens\nof technology in my writing we got\ncomputers we got networks we got email\npseudo productivity can't be be\nsustainable in that context because now\nwith something like email and then later\ntools like slack I can demonstrate\neffort at a very fine grain right\nbecause I can send an email respond to\nthis jump onto a slack conversation I\ncan now do that at a very fine grain\nlevel um and essentially everywhere and\nanywhere all throughout my day I can be\ndemonstrating labor at home I can be\ndemonstrating labor because we have\nmobile Computing we get the smartphone\nRevolution um so there there's now an\nability to constantly be demonstrating\neffort at all points of our day and\nthat's where I think the wheels came off\nthe bus right and and led to this this\nthis point that got worse and worse\nstarting the early 2000s and hit ahead\nin the pandemic of knowledge worker\nburnout knowledge worker exhaustion and\nnihilism of like what's going on with my\njob like all I do is zoom all day what's\nhappening I think that pseudo\nproductivity plus front office it\nRevolution they did not play nice\ntogether and you can see this by the way\nif you look even at productivity books\nyou see this huge shift that happens\nearly 90s versus early 2000s it's like a\ncompletely shift in tone right early 90s\nit's stepen cvy is very optimistic it's\nlike how are we going to self-actualize\nand like carefully choose the most\nmeaningful activities to fulfill all of\nour dreams for all of our roles early\n2000s now we have email you have David\nAllen that's like oh my God we're so\noverwhelmed with task all we can hope\nfor is like these little moments of Zen\nin the day if we can just automate how\nwe're just churning through these\nwidgets at least we can find some\ncognitive pieace uh what happened in\nthose 10 years was to office it\nRevolution and now we just felt like we\nhad to constantly be demonstrating that\nvisible effort so you know I think\nthat's where we got into the problem\npseudo productivity plus\ntechnology recently my podcast team was\nin Australia and um my producer and uh\nclose friend here uh Rob Moore uh\ninstructed all of us to get rid of\nsocial media on our phones except one\nguy who would post our weekly episodes\nannouncements um and it was pretty\nbrutal at first and then coming back to\nsocial media has actually turned out to\nbe more challenging you really\nexperience the friction coming back the\nother way and then one experiences the\nthe lack of friction and that's where it\ngets scary it's it's so interesting the\nway that the brain can adapt um the\nfriction leaving something behind um the\nfriction coming back to it um and I\nthink for people listening to this I I\nraise this because I think of course\nmany people listening are you know have\nwork that they really need to focus on\nthey may be having issues with uh\nproductivity and burnout Etc I think a\nlot of people use the phone in social\nmedia because it fills their life you\nknow it provides some enrichment and\nthey aren't necessarily committed to\nspecific projects but I guess through\nthe lens of the the let's just call it\nthe Cal new poran lens one might argue\nthat those people uh almost certainly\nhave untapped creativity untapped\nresources within them that um they don't\nyet know about because they're\nessentially using that energy elsewhere\nyeah I mean I think for a lot of people\nit's papering over the void right you\nhave this void in your life because\nthere's the unmet potential uh unmet\ninterest um living in misalignment with\nthe things you care about right I mean a\nlot of people this is the classic sort\nof catastrophe of life right social\nmedia and there's before this it was\nother things right there was other\nintoxicants or other sorts of\ndistractions it's a way for some people\nof essentially putting a screen over\nthat like gaping void and it like just\nmakes it bearable enough that you can\nkind of go on with life and so it is\ntrue if you just rip it out you see the\nvoid and that's really difficult right I\nmean because I I did this experiment for\none of my books I ran an experiment with\n1600 people and they all turned off all\ntheir social media for 30 days 30 days\n30 days right these are young people old\npeople a whole mix okay a whole mix not\njust University students I recruited\nthem from my my newsletter readership so\nthey weren't University students and it\nwasn't formal research it was you know I\nput out the call right so this is not\nrandomly sampled right but I put out the\ncall and I said here I'm going to walk\nyou walk you through this and then I got\na lot of information back so people\nreported back how it went and this was\nlike the number one thing I heard was\nit's really hard at first right and so\nwho are the people that succeeded for 30\ndays versus those who didn't the the\nones who didn't succeed it tended to\njust try to White Knuckle it just be\nlike I don't like how much I'm using\nsocial media I'm just going to stop\nbecause it's bad and I don't want to do\na bad thing I'm just going to like you\nknow hold on the table White Knuckles\nthey wouldn't make it 30 days the people\nwho did succeed followed my advice to\nincredibly aggressively pursue\nAlternatives in those 30 days so it's\nlike go learn new hobbies join things\nright away get like really structured\nabout your day um get into exercise\nagain learn how to knit again a lot of\npeople said oh I learned about I forgot\nhow fun libraries were like you can go\ninto this building and like all the\nbooks are free and there's there you\ncould just grab whatever and it's okay\nif you don't like the book because you\ndidn't have to pay for it uh I'm going\nout with friends again I'm I'm okay\nevery week I'm going to have you know\nwe're going to have drinks with this\nperson and every Thursday morning I'm\ngoing to go running with this person the\npeople who aggressively tried to put in\nplace a more positive alternative\nthrough self-reflect experimentation\nthey lasted the 30 days and Beyond right\nand so then I came to realize like oh I\nsee what's happening here is you have\nthese unmet needs these tools can give\nyou sort of a a simulacrum of meeting\nthem I need I'm a social being I need to\nbe connected to people well I'm texting\nand like doing comments on social media\nit sort of touches that a little bit\njust enough that you don't feel\nhopelessly lonely but it's not really\nfulfilling that um I have a need to like\nsee my intentions made manifest\nconcretely in the world humans want to\ndo this well I'm you know posting these\nthings and people are responding it's\nsort of this simulacrum of real creation\nso it's like kind of satisfying that\njust enough that it's not just\nintolerable right um and so what happens\nis if you remove that you have to\nactually fill those things the right way\nso now I'm not socializing on social\nmedia but but I'm going out of my way to\nsacrifice time and attention on behalf\nof other people I'm feeling the social\nvoid in the right way now I don't really\nfeel like I need to go back uh I'm\nactually build making my intentions\nmanifest I'm learning skills and\nBuilding Things now this sort of pseudo\nconstruction and Collective attention\neconomy of social media I'll post this\nand you'll like it I'll like this um I\ndon't need that anymore to fill that\nvoid so it's like you have to fill the\nvoid first so so you know five years ago\nI wrote a book that was about reforming\nthis part of your life\nand a lot of the book was had nothing to\ndo with technology but about how to\nactually just rebuild parts of your life\nand on my podcast honestly like one of\nthe big topics we talk about which is\ncrazy that I'm a technologist and I\nwrite about trying to find focus in a\ndistractive world is this thing we call\nthe Deep life which is just straight up\nbuilding a meaningful life 101 and it's\nlike crazy that my podcast is talking\nabout it but on the other hand it's not\nbecause my it's the podcast people go to\nwhen they're fed up with the digital\nworld and it turns out if you don't get\nthe anal anog World working right for\nyou you need something to avoid staring\nto that void and then the digital world\nwill do that well enough it's like just\ngood enough to keep life\ntolerable there's a lot of discussion\nnowadays about ADHD attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder sometimes U minus\nthe H minus the\nhyperactivity uh a lot of kids have true\nclinically diagnosed ad ADHD so we want\nto be um sensitive to that it's a real\nissue for a lot of people a lot of\nadults true ADHD um but nowadays people\ntalk about ADHD the same way terms like\num depression trauma uh gas lighting and\num Etc are discussed in in non-clinical\nterritory OCD people use clinically as\nwell right right and um and I'm not\ndisparaging that it's just that we we\nhave sort of a dilution of deeper\nunderstanding of what these things\nreally are and aren't um what are your\nthoughts I realize you're not a\npsychiatrist but what are your thoughts\non the idea that um many uh people that\nthink they perhaps have true attention\nissues have either um built those\nattention issues through neuroplasticity\num uh into their system meaning their\nsystem probably work nervous system\nprobably worked pretty well to focus but\nthey engaged in enough task switching\nthat the circuits of the brain involved\nin cognition became optimized for um\nthis very distributed cognition um as\nopposed to um narrow focused attention\nand what are your thoughts about um just\nthe amount of stimulant use on college\ncampuses and in in adult populations to\nto try and overcome this I feel like\nthere's a lot of um attempts to use\npharmacology to match the level of\ndistraction to try and make that\ndistraction not seem like distraction um\nbut you know this is a this is an area I\nhear a lot about given the nature of the\nthings I cover on the podcast I think a\nlot of these issues are phone induced\nright um and and I think the problem is\nyeah not solvable as much you don't need\npills you need a different phone Rel\nrelationship my optimistic hypothesis is\nagain this uh\nnon-clinical uh difficulty with\nmaintaining attention like in your work\nor if you're a college student or\nwhatever um it's not necessarily\nrepresenting sort of knock on wood like\na wholesale nural rewiring like that I\nbasically rewired my circuits on my\nbrain to be a sort of distributed\nswitching processor I think most of this\nis is persisting um in that much more\nmalleable area that gets affected by\nmoderate behavioral addictions right so\nthe the we have parts of the brain that\nare part of these like feedback reward\nLoops that's meant to be malleable right\nI mean this is supposed to be so we can\nhave really rapid learning about what's\nhappening in our environment and how\nwe're supposed to respond to it and and\nthis is what gets hijacked when you you\nbuild up these behavioral addictions and\nso it's it's very quick to change um but\nthat malleability means you can change\nit back right so so I I I think this\nthis drive to I have to keep checking my\nemail or my phone is again you build up\na moderate behavioral addiction because\nof like standard reward cues\nand and that's a part of the brain that\nyou can't it's difficult but it's not\nyour whole brain is now a social media\nbrain and that's just the brain you have\nbecause you're exposed to this um it's a\nmatter of you know getting the stimuli\nout of your life doing the same type of\ntraining you would do uh ex boredom\nexposure like get used to the idea of\nfeeling that drive and not actually\ndoing it you can work with blocking apps\nlike there's stuff you can do this is\nsort of like standard it's painful it\ntakes two months and then like you're\ndoing better on it so I do think we have\na a a large stratum of\nsubclinical attention issues that are\nnot representing wholesale neural\nrewirings but are like absolutely sort\nof expected outcomes of working with\nmalleable reward CU circuits in the\nbrain we can fix those just like we can\nif you know you're you're uh you're\ngambling too much or compulsively eating\nthe junk food or something we don't say\nyour whole brain got we red for junk\nfood it's like no you have this ex this\nparticular Q cycle that we have to work\non so maybe I'm being optimistic that\nthere and you know the brain better but\nlike it would be extraordinary if in\nlike a 10-year period right your entire\nbrain somehow got rewired in a way that\nit couldn't sustain Focus anymore I\ntotally agree with that statement unless\nuh you're a young person and you grew up\nin a distracted world and your brain\noptimized as the young brain does for\nthe conditions it's in and then I think\nyou have a real issue yeah um which is\nnot to say it can't be rescued through\nthe use of dis\ntools protocols pharmacology nutrition\ngreat sleep and if necessary\nprescription drugs right because there\nis a case for prescription drugs in\ncertain um instances for ADHD and and as\nI understand it um you know anytime\npeople say wait aren't those drugs just\nmeth isn't it just speed y they are\namphetamines in most cases and the idea\nis to increase the deployment of C\ncertain neuromodulators the ones I\nmentioned before um as a means to induce\nneuroplasticity so that the focus state\nbecomes more of a default State um so I\nthink that young people are in trouble I\nthink that we I do worry about young\npeople I think we' it's um it's akin to\nputting them in a kind of a well we know\nthis in the visual system if you take an\nanimal or human and you put them into an\naltered visual environment um the visual\nsystem changes and your perception of\nthe visual world is becomes inaccurate\num and the way I think of this\ncognitively with respect to attention\nthe analogy would be I think we've been\nfor the last 10 years or so 10 15 years\nwe've been raising kids in a sort of um\nHouse of uh funh house mirror things\nwhich is anything but fun where you look\nat yourself and your legs are shorter\nthan and your torso is long and so\neverywhere you turn you're getting a\ndistorted perception and trying to\nnavigate the world through that\ndistorted perception is very very\ndifficult you can do it but it's a lot\nof extra work that's what I feel we've\ndone to young people I'm I'm very\nconcerned about that as well yeah yeah\nand and I think I don't know what your\ntake on this but like do you think\nat the undergraduate level that we have\njust been not explicitly but just sort\nof implicitly uh professors in general\nwe have been just sort of slowly\nadapting the difficulty of what we're\nteaching Etc because we maybe there's a\nreduced cognitive Focus capacity which\nis like the key skill for this sort of\nvery artificial thing of learning you\nknow complicated college level work I\nthink this would be an interesting\nexperiment to find out is have we been\nimplicitly having to sort of simplify\nthings to keep roughly speaking grade\ndistributions where normatively we feel\ncomfortable I mean do we see the signal\nyet that's my interest do we see the\nsignal yet if we look back a generation\n20 years ago versus now I don't know for\ncourses of the sort that I teach or\ntaught until very recently I still teach\nbut I was directing the neuron Anatomy\ncourse and there's a laboratory module\nso the students dissect brains they're\nholding actual human brains um that's a\nreal physical contact that cannot be\nrecapitulated um um digitally you just\ncan't do you can try you use VR but it's\nit ain't the same I mean how would you\nlike it if you're a neurosurgeon learned\num on a virtual brain and then it does\nsurgery on a real brain no not no such\nthing should or uh happen I think that\num my experience with this is\nperhaps most relevant with respect to\nsocial media where I teach Neuroscience\nyeah and I use a variety of duration of\nClips you know the 902 real the you know\nseven minute thing the two and a half\nhour podcast that you know we have\npodcast solo podcast have four and a\nhalf hours um I don't know how many\npeople listen start to finish but I\nthink having a variety of different\ndurations really helps um and I'm told\nby my team I have a Tik Tok account\nalthough I've never logged on there um\nyou know I think Tik Tok represents the\nextreme of kind of bubble gum level um\ninformation SL entertainment and they\nreally nailed some some circuit that can\nhandle information of about 30 to 60\nseconds in a format that um tickles the\nbrain just right to keep swiping liking\ncommenting and sharing yeah um and I\ndon't think that's anything like a real\nunderstanding or education yeah I mean\nit's nothing like a real understanding\nor education yeah I mean Tik Tok in\nparticular like I think something what\npeople get wrong about Tik Tok is they\nthink that there was a uh real\nalgorithmic Innovation which is not the\ncase like as far as I understand the the\nmachine learning algorithm underneath\nTik Tok is probably like a relatively\nstandard sort of multiarm bandant you\nknow uh intermittent feedback\nreinforcements algorithm all they did is\nthey cleared out all the other noise so\nyou know if you're Facebook or something\nlike this uh you're trying to use\nalgorithms to curate things but you have\nall these other Legacy structures you\nalso have to try to satisfy there's\nfriends and you know you want to show\nstuff that your friends like more than\nother people and there's groups you're\njoining Tik Tok just got rid of all the\nnoise and so we're just going to all\nwe're doing is optimizing uh watch time\nto we we think we don't know but we\nthink watch time is the main thing that\nthey're they're uh optimizing just want\nto optimize it watch time and everything\nall these videos all Just exist as\nmulti-dimensional points in this sort of\nsemantic cloud and all we're doing is\njust showing you things and then you\nswipe another thing swipe another thing\nso when you get rid of all the noise\nfrom a machine learning algorithm it\ndoesn't also have to satisfy that I\nfollow this person on Instagram or this\nis my friend all I have to do is\noptimize this one number how long did\nthey watched before they swiped it just\nturns out like oh it's really easy like\nyou do that for a couple hours you're\ngoing to hone in on these sub regions\nand this massive multi-dimensional space\nof stuff that just tickles this\nparticular person's brain you know and\nit's very cybernetic because now I'm the\nuser of Tik Tok I'm the content creator\nI'm getting immediate feedback what's\nworking what's not I really quickly find\nthese particularly Rich regions in this\nsort of cybernetic space and so it's\nlike Tik Tok just purified something\nthat was simple basic machine learning\nbut just like purify what we're doing\nhere and and that turned out to be\nenough to create what's like probably\nthe most addictive Force we've seen in\nthe digital world in a long time so Tik\nTok is optimized for dwell time yeah\nthat's the thought right because it's\nnot public so like we don't exactly know\nhow the algorithm works but people have\nbeen studying it like a Skinner box you\nknow 100 phones and we we look at all\nthese accounts looking at the variables\nit seems like that's largely what it's\noptimizing for is uh how long did you\nwatch before you swiped right and that's\nit so there I mean it's not this was\nboth uh what was smart about Tik Tok and\nalso why I've been arguing it's it's\ndestabilized the whole traditional\nsocial media narrative is because the\ntraditional massive social media players\nof the last decade had this uh first\nmover advantage on these giant actual\nsocial networks right so like Twitter\nand Facebook and Instagram had these uh\nmassive networks of people's uh\npreferences of I'm following this person\nand this person I'm following uh and\nthey could leverage these actual social\ngraphs as a huge source of producing\ninteresting content right and this was a\nhuge first mover Advantage because you\ncan't it's hard to get a 100 million\npeople to use something now right Tik\nTok got rid of all that we don't want a\nsocial graph you as a user don't have to\ndeclare anything you don't have to\nfollow people or say who your friends\nare will'll just start showing you\nthings and that was more compelling than\nwhat you could generate with a social\ngraph but now there's no first mover\nAdvantage so as the big social media\nplayers follow the Tik Tok model which\nis much more Al rmic let's just try to\ncurate based on algorithms not who you\nfollow or who your friends are they're\nnow much more vulnerable because Tik Tok\ncould come along and do this without\nhaving to spend five years getting\npeople to cleare their friends and now\nif someone else could come along and do\nthis so I think the major players are\ngiving away their competitive Advantage\nwhich is this uh the social graph IP\nthat no one will ever replicate again\nthey're giving away that advantage and\nnow it's a free-for-all playing field of\nall sources of attention engagement so I\ndon't know I think Tik Tok accidentally\ndestabilized the social media decade\nthat had been defining until I think\njust recently what I find so interesting\nabout social media platforms like Tik\nTok is that um sure it makes sense that\num kids and teens would use it they were\nraised with it Snapchat Etc but when I\nsee my peers who you know we call\nourselves adults um people in their mid\nto late 40s 50s essentially like playing\nkids games or engaging through these\nplatforms that are and they're not\nchildlike necessarily but they they just\nprove that the um or rather that their\nadherence SL addiction to them just\nproves that this is tapping into some\ncore neural circuit that exists in\neveryone um so while it might be shaping\nthe uh young brain a lot this is adults\nbasically eating junk food all day um\nwhich raises a question you know I think\num while there are many different ways\nto eat and it's not a topic we want to\nget into now um Lord knows that's a\ngreat way to to create um a lot of\nsocial media content debating which diet\non omore carav or vegan Etc um the\nnotion of intermittent\nfasting um limiting one's portion of the\nday where they eat to whatever 6 hours 4\nhours 12 hours um is an interesting one\nthat maybe has some applicability here\num what are your thoughts about simply\nnot turning on the phone maybe even not\nturning Wi-Fi on if people are are not\nas disciplined as you are with the\nlaptop or tablet um for the first 2\nhours of the day or 4 hours of the day\nor for a portion of the day sort of like\nyou're taking a a social media fast that\nisn't 30 days it's you know which I\nthink for a lot of people is going to\nevoke um High cortisol release uh just\nthe idea of it yeah uh know this is an\nidea I've written about before you know\nin deep work I had this chapter called\nEmbrace boredom that was the entire idea\nright so the idea was um boredom by\nitself is not I think laudable right\nthere there's a reason why it feels\ndistressing when things feel distressing\nthat's usually an evolutionary signal\nthat there's something going on here but\nwhat I was arguing in that chapter was\nexactly what you're talking about you\nshould have some moments every day where\nyou're free from distraction even though\nyou could be accessing distraction and\nyou want to and like a little bit each\nday 20 minutes each day and then maybe a\nlonger session once a week like a couple\nhours um my argument for that was it's\nabout breaking a pavlovian connection in\nthis sense right so if it's every time I\nfeel bored I'm lack of Novel stimuli I\nget this release of the phone your mind\nis really going to make that Association\nof like this is what we always do if\nsometimes you don't it's a different\ncognitive landscape right your mind is\nuh sometimes we get the distraction\nsometimes we don't that's a much better\nplace to be because now when it comes\ntime to actually focus on something you\nknow your mind's like I've been here\nbefore like we don't always get the\ndistraction so you know this is going\nback you know early 20th century\npsychology there's probably a more\nneuroscientific way to think about this\nbut it's like breaking pavlovian Loops\nif like sometimes at the end of the day\nI'm exhausted\nit's Instagram time and it like\nscratches an itch but other times I'm\nbored I'm in line at the pharmacy and I\ndon't look at the phone my brain learns\nlike yeah we don't always do it and and\nso the idea is that you know if you make\nboredom more\ntolerable then you're much more likely\nto succeed with doing things that are\nboring but hard and I think deep work\nfor example is boring just in the\nclinical sense of there's lack of Novel\nstimuli you're just doing the same thing\nfor a long time so I've always advocated\nfor that is like you shouldn't be un\nsuper uncomfortable with boredom like\ndon't go seeking it I'm a big believer\nof in boredom is where all creative\nInsight comes from I think it's a strong\nevolutionary cue like leave this state\nbut you do have to have some tolerance\nfor it I wonder if we need a different\nword than boredom um are you familiar\nwith this notion of Gap effects in\nlearning these Gap effects are similar\nto the effects of um neural processing\nduring sleep um focused attention with\nsome agitation triggers neuroplasticity\nand learning but it's during sleep in\nparticular deep sleep rapid eye movement\nstates of deep bre maybe in some forms\nof meditation that the actual rewiring\ntakes place and then there's this\nliterature about Gap effects which have\nbeen demonstrated for music for math for\nmany things in which if people say are\npracticing new scales on the piano for\ninstance but could be any skill and then\nthey um intermittently are are cued by a\nbuzzer to just stop and do nothing the\nthe hippocampus which is involved in\nlearning memory replays the action\nsometimes in Reverse just as it occurs\nduring sleep um at a rate of maybe 20 or\n30 times faster at the neural\nlevel we're not talking about boredom\nwhat we're talking about is pauses\nduring which perhaps\num we are obtaining accelerated\nneuroplasticity the Gap effects\ncertainly accelerate learning I've\ntalked about these in other podcasts but\nI wonder whether or not this thing that\nyou're calling boredom so being in line\num to get some groceries yeah and not\ntaking one's phone out while the Checker\nis you know scanning the groceries\nthrough and just not really doing much\nof anything it's entirely possible that\nthe thing that we were working on\nearlier that day or the previous day is\nbeing processed in the hippoc campus at\nan unconscious level at a much more\nrapid rate where we to look at our phone\nwe would inhibit those Gap effects which\nare truly beneficial yeah well I mean\nprofessors feel this all the time right\nat least a lot of ones I've talked to\nwith peer reviews so I don't know if\nyou've had this experience but you're\nlike reviewing a paper I often have this\nexperience where when I'm first engaging\nwith the paper I feel incredibly\nfrustrated like I I don't quite\nunderstand what they're doing here like\nthis mathematics isn't quite making\nsense to me and it'll often be the fact\nI come back later\nlike well let me just like write up what\nI have so far and your understanding is\nlike much much better right so there's\nthis this sense of maybe something's\nbeing processing I took that so\nseriously when I was uh especially at\npost stock like when I was at the height\nof just all I do in my life is produce\nvalue with my brain every day I would do\nwhat I call thorough walks because I I\ndiscovered thorough while a grat student\nI read it down by the Charles like the\nfull sort of you know just minus the\nBeret like pretentious gratitude and\nthing but I was really in the the the\nWalden um real influential book for me\nso every day when I would walk back I\nwas living on Beacon Hill walking from\nMIT so people who know Boston it's it's\ngoing across the Longfellow bridge I\nwould say nothing but nature observation\nlike that's what I'm doing I'm just uh\noh the ice is thinner on the Charles\ntoday like look at this tree or the\nleaves coming back partially I think\nwhat was going on is like this was right\nafter I'd been whiteboarding it right uh\nI think it was letting stuff process\nright so I had this explicitly in my\nroutine uh a lot of time where I was\nokay I can't think about work at all I\ncan't do anything else but you know I'm\nthinking about the tree I'm thinking\nabout the water like really sort of\nminimal cognitive lifts and I wonder if\nthat's what was going on there like to\nme that I that was a very productive\nperiod of my life yeah I feel like in\nthe in the last five 10 years thanks\nlargely in part to Matt Walker's book\nwhy we sleep and the advocacy around\nsleep from others um we've come to\nunderstand that sleep is essential for\nmental health physical health and\nlearning cognitive Performance Physical\nperformance so much much so that now\npeople devote immense amounts of\nattention and and resources to trying to\nget the best possible night sleep\nwhereas it was the I'll sleep when I'm\ndead mentality prior to that and I I\nwould love to see a world where um\npeople Embrace not the notion of boredom\nper se but the notion of gaps um lack of\nexternal stimuli coming into our our\neyes and our cognitive system as a means\nto get smarter to get more creative to\nget better we just need a language fore\nthis and I think it's the you know so\noften language is a separator when it\ncomes to health and performance tools\nand something I've really strive for is\nto try and um create language that's not\nlinked to any one person that\nillustrates what something is for so\nmaybe um no small task Cal but maybe\nwe'll just uh have you rename boredom as\num neural rewiring um epox or something\nlike that I'll come up with the term my\nwhole writing cve by the way is based on\ntaking things people already intuitively\nknow in their gut and giving it a\ntwo-word name just having the language\naround that really matters like oh deep\nwork oh okay that's like this activity I\nkind of knew that was important but I\ndidn't have a name or digital minimalism\nlike oh yeah that I kind of know what\nthat means like it's a different\ndifferent philosophy towards it but\nthere's all so I do have a name related\nto the the gaps we're talking about but\nbut for one of the other negative\neffects right so we have the positive\neffects you talked about which is\nconsolidation of learning and\nacceleration of learning we had the one\nnegative effect which was the pavlovian\nconnection to distraction the other I've\nwritten about before is Solitude\ndeprivation right so so I'm using a\ndifferent definition of solitude than\nthe colloquial one most people think of\nit as a physical thing I'm I'm just\nisolated but there's a there's a\ncognitive psychological definition of\nsolitude which means absence of stimuli\ncreated by other human Minds right so\nI'm not taking in information that's\ncoming directly from another human mind\nuh having no period with this Solitude\nso having no period in your day where\nyour free from stimuli creative from\nother Minds is Solitude deprivation and\nit's a real issue and partially it's a\nreal issue because when we're processing\ninput from another human brain it's all\nhands- on Deck right I mean we're very\nsocial beings a huge portion of our\nbrain is dedicated to this right um so\nit's a very cognitively expensive\nactivity when I'm trying to understand\nanother human's what they're saying I'm\nsimulating their mental state I'm trying\nto understand like where do they fall in\nthis sort of social hierarchy and one of\nmy arguments was um when you spend your\nentire day in that state it's exhausting\nand anxiety producing and like until we\nhad smartphones and ubiquitous wireless\ninternet the idea that you could banish\nall Solitude from your day is laughable\nit's just impossible right so of course\nwe had a lot of portions of our day\nwhere our brain was not like ramped up\nin gear four like the sort of social\nprocessing mode but smartphones makes it\npossible that you can be in that mode\nall day long and so like one of the\nthings I hypothesize is some of the\nanxiety Rises that goes with the age of\nsmartphones is brain exhaustion right so\nthat's like that's another negative\neffect of the const we have two negative\neffects now for the constant stimuli and\none positive effect for the absence of\nthe constant stimula so I think we're\nmaking a case here for not always being\non your device yeah I agree one of my\nfavorite literatures from neurosciences\nI think most people have heard of the\nso-call critical period stages of\ndevelopment when the brain is\nessentially hyperplastic to any input um\nfor better or worse this is uh a stage\nof Life called childhood um and then of\ncourse people throughout the number 25\nafter age 25 plasticity is possible\nrequires more effort tension Etc and\nthen sleep um so forth but we know based\non really beautiful studies that if you\ndeprive someone of sensory input um for\neven a few hours um and we're not\ntalking about sitting in a completely\nblackened room um with no input but you\nyou essentially limit the amount of\nsensory input in the period that follows\nyou get a uh an opportunity for a hyper\nplastic response to any stimuli and this\njust makes sense if you understand\nBasics about signal the noise and the\nvisual system and uh and the and the\nBrain it just means when there's a lot\nof background shatter of stuff it's\nharder to see the stuff that matters and\nthe stuff that the brain should rewire\nto um very computer sciency\nneuroengineering type perspective but um\nyes I would love for you to come up with\na a two-word description of of this um\nit's not boredom induced plasticity it's\nthis quiet induced hyper plasticity or\nsomething I don't know maybe we can Riff\non this together sometime not trying to\nmove into your space but um I have a\nvery practical question um and I'd love\nto get a little more insight into the\nstructure of your days um but are you a\nlist maker like do you wake up in the\nmorning and make lists and cross things\noff and then decide what are the key\nitems on that list no I'm a Time blocker\ntime blocker yeah yeah so I'm not a big\nbeliever in to-do list I like to Grapple\nwith the actual available time like okay\nI have a meeting here I have to like\npick my kids up from school here here's\nthe actual hours of the day that are\nfree and where they fall all right what\ndo I want to do with that time well okay\nnow that I see that there's a lot of\ngaps in the middle of the day here\nthey're short maybe there I'm going to\ndo a lot of small non-only demanding\nthing oh this first 90 minutes in the\nmorning is like the main time I have\nuninterrupted okay so this I'm going to\nwork on writing so i' I've been a big\nbeliever of this since I was an\nundergrad like you give your time a job\nas opposed to having a list which is\nsomewhat orthogonal to what's actually\nhappening in your day and then just as\nyou go through your day saying what do I\nwant to try to do next which I think is\na lot less\nefficient I'm going to try your method\num I try and structure my days as much\nas I can but it just never quite Works\num do you work late into the night are\nyou no no I'm I'm a 5:30 man okay yeah\nso 5:30 p.m that's it yeah more or less\nthat's my cuto off now the the one\nexception is um if I'm writing on\nDeadline I'll sometimes like if I need\nto get more writing done I can do uh an\nevening writing session which which I\ngot used to through long experience of I\nused to write my blog post at night\nafter like my kids went to bed now older\nand they don't go to bed as early so\nit's like the one thing I have left that\nI'll do after 5:30 is like every once in\na while I'll do like a 90minut evening\nwriting block um but I call this by the\nway this whole philosophy I call fixed\nschedule productivity and I've been\ndoing it since I was a grad student fix\nthe work hour schedule that's my\ncommitment I work in these hours um and\nthen work Downstream from that for\neverything else so like this controls\nlike even what you decide to bring into\nyour life because you know I can't go\npast a schedule um and it drives you to\nbe more Innovative and how you deal with\nyour time and schedule you have to be\nefficient because you only have these\nthese hours here uh that's been you know\na signal for my my life since I was in\nmy early 20s fix the schedule and don't\nwork outside of that schedule now it's\nyour move to figure out anything you\nwant to do you have to make that work\nyou want to become a professor figure\nout how to make that work you want to\nwrite books while you're being a\nprofessor figure out how to make that\nwork you don't have the option of just\nthrowing hours at it and you innovate a\nlot I think when you have the\nconstraints where do sleep and exercise\nfit into your schedule uh what's your\ntypical to bed time wakeup time what\nwhat's your um typical exercise routine\nand the reason I ask about this is\nbecause I think nowadays we hopefully\npeople understand that exercise and\ncognitive function are are inextricably\nlinked yeah and we're all going to live\nlonger lives and be sharper mentally by\ndoing exercise yeah so I mean my main\nlike actual working with weights I do\nthis pre-dinner right and this was an\ninnovation the last couple of years it's\nit's a fantastic psychologically for me\nthis is a trans I from work to like\nfamily time after work so so I'll do\nlike 45 50 minutes uh garage gym you\nknow the we built during covid after I'm\ndone working before dinner and once you\nget used to that like it also forces you\nto like I got to finish work because I\ngot to get this in before dinner but\nthen I'll do also quite a bit of walking\nif it's not a teaching day so I'm not on\ncampus uh I do a lot of thinking on foot\num you know walking my kids to the bus\nstop which isn't particularly close in\nback so I'll do a lot of walking but\nthat's when I my serious exercise now is\nalways always pre- dinner then uh I want\nto be up you know in our room by 10:\nyeah and then at that point I don't\ntrack so I have uh insomnia issues which\nwhich actually has been like key driver\nof a lot of the things I think about\nespecially with slow productivity is I'm\nvery wary because I can without any\ncontrol on my own just find myself\nunable to sleep sometimes fall asleep or\nstay asleep fall asleep yeah I mean I\nused to get it really bad um not so bad\nnow but you know it comes and goes that\nreally affected the way I thought about\nproductivity because it seemed like to\nme the the definition of just I get\nafter it with a bunch of stuff wasn't\nreally on the table because if my notion\nof productivity depended on me like\nevery day being able to just like hammer\non a bunch of stuff I'm very busy have\nlots of commitments what would happen if\nI couldn't sleep I wouldn't be able to\ndo that so it I drifted naturally\ntowards a definition of productivity\nwhich was it doesn't really matter if\nyou work tomorrow but it is important\nthat like this month you work like\nwriting a book it doesn't matter if you\nwork on your book chapter tomorrow in\nparticular but like this month you have\nto spend a lot of time working on it so\nit was uh like an insomnia compatible\ndefinition of productivity was sort of\nmorphed into this idea of slow\nproductivity taking your your time with\nit so it's interesting so like sleep\nissues really shaped the way I thought\nabout work and put me on these much\nlonger time scales of productivity try\nnot to be dependent on any particular\nday being critical to what you do I\ndon't want the high stress situation I\ndon't want the like I'm just going to 10\nhours a day for the next 10 days we're\ngoing to make this deal happen like I\ncan't operate in that space because I\nworry about it any time my brain could\nbetray me and I could like lose sleep\nfor a couple days I think it's really\nimportant that you're sharing this\nbecause while people's challenges differ\nI think oftentimes people hear the\ncontent of my podcast or other podcasts\nand think oh gosh I have to have\neverything dialed in just right when in\nfact most all of the tools and protocols\nthat have been discussed on the huberman\nLab podcast are in response to a\nparticular challenge that I've had um or\nthat others close to me have had um and\nI I love this well I I'm sorry that you\nsuffer from insomnia we have a series uh\non sleep with Matt Walker in which he\nlays out some some great tools that we\nhaven't yet discussed on the podcast\nI'll just um send you text you I'll call\nyou with with a short list of those and\nhopefully they'll help but as we do\ncover insomnia in some depth but but I\nthink it's important that people realize\nthat they can be very productive with\nthe hours that they have and the the\nmoments or hours of of high focused\nClarity that they have um even if\nthey're not sleeping great even if\nthey're raising small children um\nbecause that's the real world and\ncertainly that's the real world of\ndeadlines and Academia but um family and\num colds and flu and travel and jet lag\nand arguments and all the happy stuff\ntoo Vacations so um sounds like you're\nvery good at adapting your day to what's\ngoing on around it but that you have\ncertain sort of committed time um am I\ncorrect in assuming that you have at\nleast one period of say 60 to 90 minutes\nof real what you would call Deep work uh\nlet's say at least 5 days a week I know\nthat might be an underestimate but seems\nlike that's what what I'm that's what\nI'm extracting from this that's the goal\nright so so to me uh depending on the\nseason is how extreme I can get so the\nthe busiest season would be like a\nteaching semester right but even then\nI'm going to make sure that 5 days week\nI'm starting with deep work and the\nnon-teaching days are more than the\nteaching days compare that to the summer\nfor example where like all I do for the\nmost part is deep work no meetings on\nMondays and Fridays all admin stuff is\nuh midday to early afternoon Tuesday\nWednesday Thursday um everything else is\ndeep work you know just locked in you\nhours at a time but I want if I'm not\ngetting five days five days of starting\nthe day with deep work I'm I'm unhappy\nright because I mean I keep coming back\nto this is okay because I'm not going to\nbe able to I mean fortunately the\ninsomnia doesn't bother hasn't bothered\nme in years but the the the threat of it\nlike completely shaped the way I I think\nabout things and because I know I'm\nnever going to be uh have a sort of like\nan Elon mus style energy of like I can\njust take on seven companies and make it\nhappen right I just don't have that\nability um I've always focused on the\nlong game and to me the long game plays\nout with get your deep work time in you\nknow just keep working on the stuff you\ndo best and get better at it you know\ntomorrow doesn't matter but if you if\nyou're doing this most days for the next\nfour months like that's going to matter\nyou know and so I often think about\nproductivity in my own life at the scale\nof decades what do I want to do in my\n20s you know okay what do I want to do\nin my 30s you know what do I want to do\nin my 40s you know U and that helps like\nin my 30s I had a lot of young kids like\nit's yeah I mean the amount of time I\ncould spend total working is like much\nless right but I could still think about\nwhat do I want to do in my 30s how do I\nmake that happen let me make sure I'm\npushing like on those things then\neverything else I can adapt to I can\ngive here and there you know it allows\nyou to be very adap adaptable when\nyou're thinking about what do I want to\ndo you know for the next 10 years it\nalso means you're not on a random\nTuesday chiding yourself because like\nwhy didn't I get three more hours of\nworking and that becomes sort of a\nnonsensical question and what you care\nabout is like what happens in the next\ndecade which is that's a long game it's\nnot about you know hustling today it's\nabout I came back to deep work day after\nday after day when other people got\ndistracted by Tik Tok you know like I'm\nGNA you whatever it's that coming back\nto what matters again and again\nyears ago I was in a scientific\ncompetition SL battle and one of my\ntools it wasn't really the kindest tool\nwas I would just suggest to the\ncompetitor um great television series so\nthe wire you which at that time was\ngreat and um we want a few they w a few\nbut um you know there's something very\naddictive about those um yeah Netflix\nshows I you know I mean they're\nunbelievably addictive just even seeing\nthe the the um slider next episode\nslider come up you can skip the intro\nit's it's just like they've just dialed\nit in go um so I suggest those to\ncompetitors all the time do no longer\nbut um and who knows what role they\nplayed but I just noticed in myself um\nhow distracting they could be they could\ntake me to when I started watching Ozark\nI found myself waking up in the middle\nof the night perhaps to use the restroom\nor something and then starting another\nepisode of Ozark was wild and um I I\nwonder whether or not a way to reverse\nengineer one's way to uh productivity or\nverse hack our way to productivity would\nbe to think about all the ways that you\nwould um\nbenevolently deploy distraction for a\ncompetitor and then um ask yourself\nwhich which of those you're still\nengaging in and think of yourself as\nsort of in a competition with the highly\ndistracted version of oneself yeah um\nbecause I think that one task um I think\nfor us today is to try and think about\nfor the person listening to this who's\nnot an academic um who's hearing about\nall this distraction that en enjoy some\nsocial media you know how how can they\nbring about the best version of\nthemselves in terms of productivity but\nalso presence for family um presence\nwith self um Etc and um and if one isn't\nin a competitive environment um then\nmaybe it's about setting up different U\nmental maps of the self and then trying\nto pit them against one another and be\nthe best version literally I think\nthat's interesting right like think\nabout what would be yeah what what I\nlike this idea of thinking about my\ncompetitor you know what would really\ngive me a leg up you am I doing this I\nme but I would also add in here this is\nlike a a slower productivity type idea\num you figure out the thing you really\ncare about you figure out what you would\nneed to do to really show up for that\nthing and then if you're doing that like\ngive yourself a break on everything else\ntoo you know what I mean it's like I'm\nthis way with WR if I'm getting in my\nwriting time I have to write I'm very\nuncomfortable when I'm not writing I\njust write all the time articles books\nyou know I'm always writing if I'm\ngetting in my writing time then it's\nlike okay the rest of the day maybe like\nthis week was a kind of a loss like the\nkids were homesick or there was a crisis\nat the University or whatever and like\nI'm just trying to keep that under\ncontrol and like have good productivity\nhabits and like don't contact switch too\nmuch and don't be too distracted but\nstill have your fixed TA of productivity\nlike end at 5:30 every day uh and time\nblock and try to be reasonable with that\ntime limit the damage but if I'm doing\nthe thing that ultimately really matters\nI'm going to be pretty happy with it so\nit's like moving the the definition of\nam I happy with what I'm producing away\nfrom a quantity metric and this more am\nI aggregating the quality reps you know\nand like I think in weightlifting this\nwould make a lot more sense right it's\nlike yeah there's a there's a certain\nnumber of like a certain amount of time\nunder load each muscle group needs to be\non and like if I'm doing that I'm happy\nif I'm you know weightlifting right\nthere's no notion of like why can't I\nwhy didn't I exercise five hours more\nthis or that and so I sometimes try to\nthink about my core intellectual work\nthat way like if I'm getting in the core\ndeep reps on the thing I care most about\nwhich for me is almost always writing\nthen like the rest I just want to it's\nit's like damage control like I want to\nlike do the other stuff well and like\nnot get too stressed out about it and\nyou know there's the productivity habits\nthen that are about doing the stuff that\nmatters and protecting it and then\nthere's the habits that are all just\nabout let's not let the other stuff get\nout of control um you I find it a little\nbit easier you go easier on myself when\nI think about it that way do you listen\nto music while you work no well the data\ncertainly support not listening to music\nor if you do listen to music listening\nto music with without lyrics yeah you\nhave to train even to get used to it\nright I mean even to get used to music\nwithout lyrics you got to get used to it\nI guess your brain's building the\nfilters um some people I have met have\ntrained themselves to work with lyrical\nmusic which I think it took them a long\ntime but I I met a self-published\nnovelist who does like a million words a\nyear which is crazy U and he blasts\nbecause he has four kids he blasts\nMetallica in NASCAR earphones and I like\nhow do you possibly write like this I\nthink he just trained his mind has just\nlike a a pure auditory filter that it's\nuh that it's adapted I guess or maybe\nhis books aren't that good I don't know\nI but I like silence or like background\nnoise but even background noise is hard\nI have a hard time riding at cafes for\nexample like I really do like lack of\nstimuli do you use visual blinders you\nknow like some people actually do this\nthey you it's like a hoodie and they'll\nlike really try and tunnel their Vision\nwhich makes perfect sense from the\nperspective of Neuroscience I mean your\nvisual world\nstrongly constrains to the the\nnarrowness or the or the um broadness of\nyour cognitive Maps yeah I mean I just\nhave my spaces engineered right so like\nwhere I write in my uh my library at\nhome all the interesting windows are\nlike behind me and over here I'm staring\nacross to Windows it just is right next\nto the neighbors and like just typically\nblinds down well as you say this it just\nmakes me want to you know shout that you\nknow so many people who think they have\nattention deficit issues um have\nprobably just put put themselves in\ncompromised environments which include\nsmartphone um apps and things that I\nmean like like there's absolutely no way\nthat they ought to be able to focus in\nfact perhaps the fact that they can\nfocus at all is is miraculous given the\nthe constraints like trying to run with\nshackles on yeah I I mean look we're\nused to this with physical stuff right\nif if we analogize to physical fitness\nwe're so used to all these details right\nlike it matters like what you're eating\nlike how you're sleeping the details of\nhow you train and when you train and how\nmuch like we're very used to this idea\nthat that really matters we have no\nintuitions for cognitive development or\napplication we we like treat our brain I\nguess because we associate it so much\nwith a sense of self it's just this sort\nof um ineffable connection to us as a\nperson we don't think of it as much of\nan organ as like a muscle or something\nlike this but we don't have a\nsophisticated vocabulary at all for\nthinking about how do you do stuff with\nyour brain which is the if you're in\nknowledge work that's the whole game\nlike the whole game is this brain takes\nan information adds value value to it it\nalchemis value out of out of mind stuff\nand people who who alchemize value out\nof you know muscles I'm a relief pitcher\nin baseball I know like my whole job is\nlike to take a certain muscles on my\nkinetic chain and use them to move a\nball very fast and if I if I really am\nvery careful about this I can have a\nmulti-million dollar deal those of us\nwho do this with our brain don't have\nany of these intuitions it's just like\nyou know you have to uh work hard you\nknow and we're on our phone all day I\nmean this has to be the physical\nequivalent if you had like an endurance\nathlete who was smoking all the time\nlike this is crazy like this is directly\ncounter\nintricacies like what what the actual\nactivity is that matters for your value\nproduction but with cognitive stuff we\nhave no intuition like this yeah when I\nwas a junior Professor this was down in\nSan Diego not Stanford my girlfriend at\nthe time she said to me she said you're\nlike a professional athlete that was\nbefore I got tenure and she was like and\nyou're trying to go from like minor\nleagues to Major go from a you know uh\nyou know like second string to a starter\nyeah it's like you have to treat what\nyou're doing like a a professional\nathlete with their their game like\nprioritize sleep prioritize food\nprioritize time prioritize you know it's\nand we as you point out we don't do that\nwith the mind we we tend for cognitive\nstuff we tend to assume that we just\nflip a switch and like Focus time and I\nthink that's in part because there are\ncertain things such as social media such\nas a great movie such as certain social\ninteractions that can immediately and\ncompletely harness our attention yeah\nunlike a marathon or where sure I could\nprobably finish the 26 miles or whever\nit is 26.2 3 I forget what it is um if I\nhad to do it right now to save my life\nbut it's not like I can just hit a\nswitch and and and I think that's the\nthat's the kind of um caveat here is\nthat the kid that loves video games can\ndefinitely Focus yeah give him or her a\nvideo game they love and boom they're\nfocused so it seems as if there's a\nproblem when they can't um but they know\nthey can right stuff's obvious when one\nStates it but I think um it's worth\npointing out that this stuff needs\nattention it needs it needs work yeah\nwhich means and it starts with\nvocabulary it starts with intention\nstarts with examples you know I mean\nthere should be a book like how to think\nthat we just give to everyone learn and\nlearn right yeah like how to use your\nbrain like the user manual you know like\nthat would be a very useful user manual\nand I think in like Elite cognitive\nprofessions this gets handed down as\nlore and people figure it out right I\nmean like this was was like my\nexperience training at MIT in the theory\ngroup is that you know everything was\nfocused on getting the most out of your\nmind and so it's being passed down from\nyou know person to person it was also in\nthe culture it was in the way that\npeople acted but most places that do\ncognitive work don't have these don't\nhave these cultures yeah but here's the\nadvantage though here like here's the\nSilver Lining right if you're one of the\nfew who cares about it it's a huge\nAdvantage right now like it's a it's a\nbig part of like my success I I don't\nthink I have the highest horsepower\nbrain but like it I care a lot about\ntrying to you know get the most out of\nit like to push it to like the edges of\nlike the Reps I can I can actually RPMs\nI can actually get out of it you know so\nit's an advantage as you know someone\nwho's listening to this you start caring\nabout your brain how it works how you\nwant to take care of it what you want to\nget out of it you start caring about\nthis um you're going to get advantages\ncompared to the person right next to you\nlike suddenly in your office or you know\nin in your grad program it's going to be\nlike what's going on here yeah you know\nlittle superpower and sometimes there's\na bit of a social cost upfront yeah when\nI made the shift from being a let's just\ncall it a not serious student to a\nserious student in college um and I was\ncoming from behind I had to put so many\nmore hours in and so\npartying was a something happened fairly\nseldom I still did it but and it was\nisolating actually lived alone in a\nstudio apartment I mean it's isolating\nthere you're you're going to miss out on\ncertain things there there's some\ndeprivation there but um you eventually\nend up in a position to do far more with\nyour life yeah of course what um you\nsaid a moment ago also reminds me David\ngoggin the David goggin no no\nintroduction needed um has been um\nquoted saying you know it's easy\nnowadays to be exceptional because so\nmany people are just distracted and and\nwasting their time so you put in 20%\nmore effort to being more focused or to\nuh toward your fitness program and\nyou're going to you're going to surpass\nmany many people yeah so it's not that\nhard to accelerate it's just it it takes\nsome practices that are um socially\nchallenging to implement it's it's funny\nI had that same experience was an\nundergrad that you had yeah because I\ncared I was impatient to be done with\ncollege and like to do things with my\nbrain I wanted to be a writer I want to\nbe an academic but you know that takes a\nlot of work and I I really cared a lot\nabout it so I was a I was a uh\nfraternity brother for one day and I\nwent to the first meeting where they're\ndoing you know held the pledging or\nwhatever and I remember I just not for\nme and and I walked away I like I'm not\ngoing because this is going to be\ndistracting like the the hangovers and\nthis and that and and you know I want to\nfocus on writing I want to learn how to\ndo this it is pretty isolating yeah um\nand I know some people that were in the\nGreek system that also benefited\ntremendously from that I I wasn't one of\nthem um but uh I I definitely resonate\nwith it so not everyone yeah me say is\nlike they don't all have to be as\nintense as you and I were um but but\ncaring about your brain it gives you a\nlot of options and if you're playing\ncatchup it there's almost always a\nsocial cost associated with it but you\neventually are joined by many other\npeople you find the other nerds that's\nbeen there's a lot of nerds the other\nthe other nerds Misfits and people who\num who are are you know seeking\nsomething uh they they come around you f\nyou you find them uh I'm interested in\nthis concept of burnout yeah um we hear\nabout burn\nout um we associate with too much\nadrenaline lack of sleep tired and wired\num feeling disengage the poet David\nWhite has a beautiful um poem I forget\nthe title about burnout where he says\nthat the I think the cure to burn out is\nwholeheartedness um and I I always like\nthat's a bit more abstract than the\nkinds of things we're talking about\ntoday um but I like that because there's\nsomething about\nwholeheartedness um really leaning into\nsomething with with the the true desire\nto be there and to explore it no matter\nhow hard that is um the opposite extreme\nof burnout yeah well I mean I think\nburnout in if we're thinking knowledge\nwork like people with office jobs my\ndiagnosis there it's not exactly\nquantity of work that that does play a\nrole it's the kind of work because I I\nthink what's happening what what's been\nderanging actually for people in these\njobs is uh workloads are getting larger\nright in part because communication is\nlow friction and we always want to be\ndemonstrating activity because of pseudo\nproductivity and people are always\nasking us to do things we say yes\neverything we say yes to brings with it\nadministrative overhead right which is\ntalking about the thing but not actually\ndoing so it's like emails about the\ncommitment it's a meetings about the\ncommitment um because our workloads are\nlarger what happens then is more and\nmore of our time has to service this\nadministrative overhead because\neverything we say yes to brings with it\nits own overhead it adds up it\nAggregates right so now more and more of\nour day is spent talking about work and\nnot actually doing the work and then\nmake it even worse it's not like this\noverhead is all batched together it's\nsort of spread out throughout your day\nso it's also putting you in that state\nof uh constant distraction which makes\nit hard to do work what I think is is\nburning people out is they're now in\nthis state where they're saying I'm\nspending most of my day talking about\nwork sending emails attending meetings\nvery little time is left to actually\nmake progress on the work and then the\nthe workload gets larger and larger this\nby itself is deranging right this it\nfeels like you're in some sort of U\nnihilistic experiment like what what is\nthis why do I have six hours of meetings\nI'm not actually this can't be the right\nway to work um and then what happens of\ncourse is you have to recover time in\nthe morning in the afternoon maybe after\nyour kids go to bed to try to actually\nmake prog ress so now you also have just\na straight work quantity issue so you're\nworking more hours there's an energy\ndrain but I think that psychological\npiece of this can't possibly make sense\nthat like I am checking email once every\ntwo minutes and spent six hours in Zoom\nlike doing very little actual high value\nwork like this can't be the right way to\nwork that's what I think the burnout\nepidemic right now is coming from is\nit's that psychological component of we\nall know this is stupid but no one is\nsaying the emperor has no clothes on we\nall know that the amount of emailing\nmeetings I'm doing is such a waste of my\nsalary like this is a highly trained\nbrain like I could be writing these\nreports or this code or creating these\nbusiness strategies um but we're all\njust accepting this so I think the\nabsurdity of the current situation is\ncreating as much of the burnout as it is\njust we also have to add these extra\nhours there just like a straight\naggregation of work\nquantity it's almost analogous to taking\nprofessional athletes or would be\nprofessional athletes and having them do\na bunch of other physical labor so that\nthey're showing up not fresh for the\ngame and little micro injuries and\ndistracted and um and no one's admitting\nthat this doesn't make sense and\neveryone's just getting injured and no\none's talking about it so it's the\nabsurdity of it would drive people crazy\nand it is driving people\ncrazy it it's so difficult though\nbecause certain things like smartphones\nare very useful on the hospital Ward I\nmean doctors can communicate nurses\ncommunicate so much faster now um\nparents and kids can communicate who's\ngoing to pick up the kids nope got stuck\nin traffic you go this way alternate\nroute on Google Maps and and on and on\nso it's all woven in with stuff that's\nthat's also highly adaptive it makes it\ntough yeah you know it's almost like the\nwork of being a selective filter is half\nthe work of trying to deload the\ncognitive systems that would allow you\nto do deep work yeah well in the\nworkplace is even harder than that right\nbecause because part of the issue is\nemail and slack but let's just say\ndigital communication um I spent a lot\nof time studying that closely right from\nlike a techn critic standpoint the\nintroduction of digital communication to\nthe workplace and the problem there is\nthe reason why we're checking this all\nthe time it's not some like individual\nhabit deoptimization it's not oh I\nshould just check this less often what\nhappened is when we introduce low\nfriction digital communication to the\noffice this emerging consensus came\nabout that said great let's just use ad\nhoc messaging as our major way of\ncollaborating like we can just figure\nthings out on the fly I can just be like\nAndrew what's going on with the whatever\nand you can answer me and I can send it\nback um this was very convenient the\nactivation cost was low and so this is\nhow we began actually collaborating on\nwork now what happens is as workloads\nget higher we now have many things at\nthe same time they're all generating\nthese asynchronous back and forth\nconversations most of these have some\nsort of time sensitivity right so if I\nemail you and say like what's going on\nwith like the guest coming later today\nwe have to kind of resolve this before\nlater today um so now it's not just that\nthese messages are going back and forth\nwith all these different threads but I\nhave to keep check in my inbox to make\nsure the gap's not too big this is not a\nfailure of habits it's not a moral\nfailure it's uh necessitated by the fact\nthat all these back and forth\nconversations have to keep moving\nforward so it is difficult then if\nyou're in this system to step out by\nyourself because this is the way we're\ncollaborating is these asynchronous back\nand forth messages and I can't disengage\nmyself from that without slowing things\ndown like from a like a mathematical\nGame Theory point of view it's a\nsuboptimal Nash equilibrium it's not the\nright place not the right way to to run\nthis the the the utility value of this\nconfiguration is low but no one\nindividual can deploy a different\nstrategy that's going to be higher value\nwe're stuck in it right and so now it\nbecomes really hard for an individual\njust to say I want to check my email\nless often it it's built in systemically\ninto this hyperactive hive mind workflow\nand the only way to break free from the\nsuboptimal configuration is to basically\nhave the organization itself do like a\nreally high cost change to the rules of\nthe game these are how we're\ncollaborating now we're not using email\nfreely anymore we're going to use this\nsystem instead here you it's a very\nexpensive top down procedure to free\nourselves from the suboptimality so like\nin the world of work that's partially\nwhy this is such an intractable problem\nI I tried to write a book about this\nrecently um and it was really hard to\ngain traction because it's not easy to\nsolve this like no individual can move\nout of this and you have to put in a lot\nof energy as an organization to try to\nto change this um so it's in some sense\nemail is a more insu problem\nthan social media on the phone because\nat least over here this is my engagement\nwith this and I might have these\nmoderate behavioral addictions but I\ncould make differences here in my\ncompany oh this is much worse this is\nlike a systemic problem it's an emergent\ndeterministic work impact on a economic\nsocial cultural system that was\ncompletely dynamical and went in a way\nwe didn't really expect so it's it's a\nit's a really tough situation sometimes\nespecially in the world of work how do\nwe get out of this constant distraction\nit's why you know I wrote deep work and\nI was like well why don't people just do\nthis that's why they don't just do this\nbecause it's not so easy to to reclaim\nthis time well it's like um when I was a\ngraduate student in postto I was focused\non eating pretty well meaning just\nclean-ish food and um people talked less\nabout that at that time I was also\nreally committed to exercise since I was\n16 um people were less committed to that\nin the academic sector at that time now\nI think it's common for people like I'm\ngoing to my yoga class I'm doing my zone\n2 cardio I go to the gym you know men\nand women do this you know I remember\nhaving like like sneak off to the gym\nlike yeah um and um you know you felt\nlike a bit of a of an oddball if you\nwere the one bringing your lunch to the\nthe you know the pizza lunch in not\nthere's anything wrong with pizza love\npizza but I was trying to eat well I\nhave for a long time I feel better when\nI do and I'm grateful that I did but you\nget some weird looks like oh do you have\nan eating disorder or something like\nthat that's what people would say then\nyep um now people would probably look\nand oh that looks better than the pizza\npeople start to understand so I think\nthere needs to be a cultural shift yep\num and I think there has been a cultural\nshift around food and exercise certainly\nfood meditation sleep y um I think\npeople are far more accepting and\nactually encouraging of their workers\nand co-workers um taking really good\ncare in order to function better for\nlonger yeah I think this going to be the\nnext Revolution and it's going to be a\nrevolution that's going to unlock we're\ntalking on the scale of like a trillion\ndollar GBP when we go through knowledge\nwork and have this revolution I call it\nlike the cognitive Revolution Let's Take\nreally seriously how the brains of our\nworkers work like these are our number\none assets like not to be too\nmechanistic about it but what is our\nmain capital asset if we're a knowledge\nwork organization we have some buildings\nbut it's really these brains that we\nhave like employment contracts with\nthese brains create value let's take\nseriously how the brains actually\noperate and as soon as we do we'll say\noh my God these brains are checking\nemail once every two minutes what a\ndisaster it's like if we had a car\nfactory and we spent $20 million on one\nof these German robots that can you know\nput cars on the doors or whatever and we\njust weren't taking care of it and it\nwas like rusting and was dropping the\ndoors and the production pipeline was\ngoing down like this is crazy we got to\ntake care of this equipment right um\nwhen we have the cognitive Revolution\nthe sort of cognitive Capital Revolution\nand knowledge work I think it's going to\nunlock a trillion dollar GDP I think\nthat's how unproductive we've been if we\njust think in the pure raw terms of\nbrains\nproducing stuff that's worth money like\nif we're like super deterministic and\nkind of inhumane about it uh so much is\nbeing lost because we're in the\nsuboptimal Nash equilibrium everyone\njust email everyone all the time\neveryone's just on slack all the time\nthat when we finally have the revolution\nto get over that it's going to be a\nmassive economic hit and you know AI\nmight play a role in this right because\nmaybe AI once it gets planning\ncapabilities is going to be able to take\nthe burden of some of this back and\nforth planning I think it's easier to\nget there with cultural shifts I don't\nthink we have to wait to build an email\ncap capable chat GPT to do this like you\ncould solve this tomorrow this is\ncultural as much as it's tool based but\nI think it's going to be a huge\nRevolution when we get there Ain to uh\nlike the assembly line in manufacturing\nwhich was like a 10x Improvement in\nproductivity metrics when we figured out\nthe continuous motion assembly line with\ninterchangeable parts was a massive it\ncreated this uh productivity engine I'm\nusing the economics s productivity now\num you know dollars per worker uh the\neconomic miracle that came from this\nprocess based industrial Innovations in\nthe the late 19th early 20th century\nthat the money generated by that the\nwealth generated by that was the\nfoundation of the modern West like the\nwhole world as we know it was built\nthere's these huge latent potentials um\nand right now I don't think we're there\nwith the brain and I think it's going to\nbe a huge Revolution it's just it's just\ndifficult right it's not an easy\nRevolution to start but I think it's\ngoing to change whole Industries in ways\nthat we're it's going to be hard to even\nimagine yeah and I think as long as\nthere are individuals who either by\nvirtue of\nlack of family or other constraints or\nby virtue of just having more energy and\nrequiring less sleep because these\nindividuals do exist out there yeah um\nthere will always be these individuals\nthat can kind of apply themselves more\nthan others in the sense that they can\nget in earlier and stay in later um and\nand that trying to be\nthem is not a good idea that we all need\nto optimize for our you know best\nbalance of productivity deep work and um\nwork life balance for lack of of a\nbetter term uh when I was a graduate\nstudent um I was really committed to My\nMy Craft and I remember that hearing\nabout a student he's now a professor a\nvery accomplished endocrinologist um\nI'll just give him a name because he he\ndid this thing he doesn't know me but I\nheard about this guy that had been in\nthe department Randy Nelson and everyone\nwas like he used to work a 100 hours a\nweek yeah so I was like all right great\nI'm going to start logging my work hours\nsilently I'm going to do 102 hours and I\nended up with a flu and an autoimmune\ncondition I literally had an autoimmune\ncondition I've never had one since then\nI stopped working that much started\nworking quote unquote smarter along the\nlines of many of the things you're\nsaying here although I didn't implement\nor know about all these tools that time\nand of course the autoimmune thing went\naway it was a fairly minor thing never\nhad it again but you can destroy\nyourself simply by working more yeah um\neven if it's deep work so that the\nsolution is not necessarily more it's um\njust like with exercise I guess that\nstands it's obvious but I I thought I'd\nshare that anecdote because uh Randy\nNelson taught me what I'm capable of and\nwhat I'm not capable of yeah well the\nother thing that happens by the way too\nit's not just who's capable of working\nmore get these advantages there's these\nother unpredictable inequities um I\ntalked to a law firm once years ago\nabout deep work and I was uh invited by\na group it was actually a a group of\nwomen lawyers who had a reading group\nand they said part of what was happening\nat this Law Firm is that people who were\nuh disagreeable like just sort of gruff\nand jerks would get asked to do less of\nwhat they would call non- promotable\nactivities or can you organize this or\nwhatever which meant they had more time\nto do deep work uh which meant they\nwould do better and they would rise\nfaster and then what was happening then\nwas you had accidentally built a system\nthat said let's make sure we have a fast\ntrack for like our most disagreeable\nemployees to the partnership level where\nactually you need to be pretty agreeable\nbecause your uh client acquisition is\nreally on the partners and so they\naccidentally had you know push towards\nthis this uh inequity and these type of\ninequities happen all the time when we\nleave it like haphazard and okay so\nwho's doing less work like like well I\njust sort of like I'm Gruff and people\ndon't like me or I have something going\non at my house that means I don't have\nthe the same time to do this um and you\nend up pushing people up these paths\nthat might not be who you really want to\nselect because you're selecting for uh\nthings that are sort of unrelated to\ntheir actual underlying Talent or like\nhow much they can actually produce and\nso I'm I'm with you on that yeah it's a\ncomplex problem but a tractable one\nnonetheless I'm interested in your\nthoughts on remote work versus in-person\nwork and the hybrid model yeah um I've\nheard about a hybrid model recently a\nfriend who owns a big um record company\nhere in Los Angeles said that um they\nrequire one in-person day per week\nunless on sick leave um they require one\nat home day per week and then the other\nday is it's at your discretion yeah it's\nkind of an interesting model but for in\na five day a week model yeah I mean I my\nmy proposals I've thought about this a\nlot is okay if you're going to do hybrid\nwork and I I proposed this in Atlantic\narticle recently which created some\npositive some negative wayes I was like\nhere's the way you should do it uh\nsynchronize the schedule here's at home\ndays here's an office days but for\neverybody for everybody okay or have a\nfew of these schedules but like groups\nof people who work together have the\nsame schedule but then make the rule at\nhome days no meetings no email like\nthat's the way to really get the full\nbenefit out of hybrid work when we're in\nthe office we have meetings and we can\ntalk about work and we're at home we're\njust doing work and we can do it without\ndistraction and we can just stay deep\nand really turn through things I think\nit would really make a big difference on\nthe overload issue I think it would be\nmuch more sustainable remote work so I\ndid a lot of coverage of remote work as\nthis was first emerging the early\npandemic there I became convinced uh I\nwas doing this twice a month column for\nthe New Yorker back then that was just\nlooking at the pandemic transforming\nwork and I came away with the idea that\nremote work can be um fantastic but it's\ndifficult and it can't just be do the\njob you were doing in person but just do\nit at home and we have zoom and we'll\nfigure it out like if you're going to be\nfully remote we have to rethink what\nwork means for that uh and there's a lot\nof differences that needs to have it\nneeds to be way more structured it\nprobably needs to be um you're working\non less things it's very clear what\nyou're working on the collaboration is\nmuch more defined and much less frequent\nyou probably need to be freed from this\nsort of hyperactive hive my dance of\nwe're just emailing each other all day\nand in Zoom meetings all day you have to\nsort of\nreconstitute what a remote work job is\nat I think before it works and we know\nthis in part because software developers\npre pandemic were one of the only\nknowledge sectors to have a a really\nsuccessful track record with remote work\nthat is the only sector within knowledge\nwork where we had large companies fully\nremote they did that because their jobs\nthey they had really structured them\naround these these agile workload\nManagement Systems where okay here's\nwhen we talk about work here's how long\nit takes here's how we assign you new\nwork you work on one thing at a time you\nsprint till it's done they had all this\nstructure around work which then it\ndidn't really matter if you in the\noffice or not so the less structured\nwork is the more free-for-all the more\nyou need we have to be in the office so\nlike I'm a huge fan of full-time remote\nwork but I think those jobs have to look\nvery different than like a standard 2019\njob yeah I've always done a hybrid of\nremote work um I used to take Wednesday\nmornings at home from the lab yeah um\nbut nowadays it's wild because\nespecially during the pandemic but still\nnow I mean you can do the whole day in\npajamas and getting work done and I love\nthis idea of no um no email and limiting\ntext and social media while at home\ndoing work to really extract the most\nout of it yeah are there any data um\nmaybe from the pandemic era or um prior\nor Beyond about zoom and things like it\nin terms of how they enhance or diminish\nor perhaps have no effect on\nproductivity like Zoom specifically and\nand meetings I we just found ourselves\nin Zoom all the time for a while that\nwas bigger problem I mean so so there is\ndata that says for example a hybrid\nmeeting some people are online some\npeople aren't these are less effective\nmeetings they don't they don't work as\nwell um but the bigger problem with zoom\nI think was the quantity and and part of\nit was just the the technology involved\nright so so if we're in the office\ntogether and I have a relatively quick\nthing to talk to you about I can just\ngrab you and we can talk about this and\nthen the footprint is going to be five\nminutes that's not just that it's five\nminutes it's five well allocated minutes\nbecause I'm probably going to use the\nsocial cues of your doors open or you're\ngoing to get coffee anyways right um in\nthe zoom era instead we would say well\nwe should set up a meeting right because\nyou know we have to talk about this but\nif you think about a standard online\ncalendar it's difficult to have a\nmeeting that's less than 30 minutes long\nI mean you just you have to drag it you\nknow I mean 30 minutes is like the\ndefault smallest length meeting so we're\ntaking a lot of informal back and forth\nand inflating the time I think that was\npart of it so we just had too much Zoom\ngoing on right if it was just I do one\nmeeting a week now it's on Zoom it used\nto be in person we were all on Zoom we\nused to all be in person it's that's not\nthat big of a deal it's maybe like a\nslightly less effective meeting but it's\nfine it's good enough but if it's I have\n4X more meetings than I used to because\nof the the inherent inefficiencies of\nhaving to go to prescheduled Virtual for\nbasically all collaboration that could\nbe a huge problem the data I saw from\nMicrosoft the last data I saw was a 22%\nincrease in these meetings from 20120 to\nnow and it's not a number it's not like\nit peaked and then it started coming\nback down again once we went to hybrid\nit we just it's just high and it's still\ncreeping up right that's a lot of time\nthat just vanished and we sort of\npretend like it didn't but that's a lot\nof time that is not actively working on\nthings and just talking about work or\ntalking about other stuff while we get\naround the talking about work I think\nit's a real issue is there a top three\nlist of things that if you had a magic\nwand you would see everyone do um each\nday you know if you had if you had three\nwishes um yes what would they be workers\nenhancing work creativity focused work I\nmean I think you and I both um clearly\nagree that there's not just great value\nin terms of productivity yeah but a\ngreat degree of of Life Enrichment like\na deep level of enrichment in terms of\nHappiness feelings of well-being con\ntime for connectivity with others\nlessons about deep work that can be\nexported to time with others where we\nare really present Etc just so much to\nbe gained from these from engaging in\ndeep work and things like it that you've\nwritten about in your various books um\nand talk about on your podcast are you\nknow is there a top three yeah yeah yeah\nso if I do three I would say Okay um\nfirst of all with your workload simulate\nsomething like a pull system instead of\na push system and what I mean by that is\nwhen you keep track of what you're\nworking on have the the top part of that\nlist which is I'm actively working on\nthese things and keep that top part of\nyour list to like two or three things\neverything else is in the bottom part of\nthe list it's to work on next and it's\nin an ordered queue and so when you\nfinish something that you're working on\nyou pull something new to take it slot\nfrom the list below right so what I'm\ntrying to do with that advice is reduce\nall this administrative overhead because\nnow even if like you can't get away you\nhave to say yes to these things because\nit's the way like your your organization\nworks the stuff that's in the waiting to\nwork on Q you said I don't have meetings\nabout that I don't do emails about that\nI wait till I'm actively working on it\nand I only actively work on three things\nat a time now I'm going to finish those\nthings really quickly because I don't\nhave 15 items worth of meetings I'm\ngoing to every day so things are going\nto pull up there pretty quickly and so\nthe rate at which I'm accomplishing\nthings will probably be higher than it\nwas before but I only work on three\nthings actively you could even make this\nvisible it's in a shared document if you\nwant to when someone asks you to do\nsomething new tell them to put it on the\nend of your queue they're like oh okay\nso like Andrew is not working on this\nright now he's working on these three\nthings and there's seven things here and\nI'm adding something number eight so I\nknow not to expect something for a while\num in fact I can keep checking this list\nuntil I see Andrew's working on it so I\ncan see it's making progress and then\nonce I know he's working on it I can\nstart email them about it and we can do\njust a normal type of overhead you would\nhave with with projects right uh that\nalone is going to have a huge difference\nlike now the amount of distraction your\nday is going to uh plummet because\nthat's generated from overhead of things\nyou've agreed to do and that's going\nthat's going to plumm that down all\nright so that'd be number one could I\njust uh thank you could I just ask a few\nquestions about that just to clarify so\nfor I use myself as an example selfishly\nbut then of course I don't know what\neveryone else out there is pursuing but\nso substitute the specifics I'm about to\ninsert here for whatever it is that you\ncare about in your life so um\nresearching podcasts yeah SOLO podcasts\nin particular for me is my major task in\nlife these days uh with respect to work\nso that would be top of the list yeah um\nand then\num there could be two other items on\nthis you know top of que um would daily\nactivities like like exercise Social\ntime with loved ones Etc would that be\nincluded there or we're talking\nspecifically about work yeah let's just\nkeep just work okay so it would be you\nknow podcast prep you might podcast prep\npodcast prep you might have the\nparticular topic though right right okay\nso pod right I'm working on an episode\nright now about about skin Health yeah\num you could you could have two\ndifferent episode topics you're prepping\nthose could both be up there yep so skin\nHealth allergies episode These are two\nthat I'm spending a lot of time on um\nmonths in fact y right and then your\nthird might be something that that\ninvolves the uh the media companies\nsomething around the business side like\nokay we're trying to figure out um a\nplan for whatever right content for for\nbrand Association or something okay got\nit great so that those three would be\ntop of the list and every day until\nthose are done they could sit top of the\nlist and then there are a number of\nitems underneath those that fall under\nwhatever yeah and and critically when\nthese other items come up right like oh\nthis is like a topic for example I want\nto do a show on you have a place to put\nit it's not being forgotten or here's a\nthere's a business idea like we need to\nfigure out like whatever we want to add\ndo something with our camera configure\nokay put on the list so it's not being\nforgotten like it it's on there and you\ncan see where it is not only is it on\nthere but like this could be shared\namong your team so as people had extra\ninformation or things to add to one of\nthese projects they can add it to it on\nthe list right so the information is\naggregating so if you use a tool like\nTrello for this Trello spelled t r l l o\nokay is it an app it's a web based\nservice that the metaphor is just index\ncards in piles got right but they're\nvirtual um but you can flip over the\nindex card digitally attach files write\nnotes and and so I use Trello for my own\norganization what I'm working on so now\nyou have a place where you can gather\nlike oh we just I just heard about\nsomething that's relevant to this thing\nI need to work on you have a place to\nput it like it goes onto the Trello card\nor you could do this with shared\ndocuments doesn't matter you're just\nlike literally typing things into a\nGoogle doc you or a whiteboard or a\nwhiteboard yeah yeah you could be we're\nkeeping track of these things right I'm\ngoing to do this by the way yeah well I\nmean I'm a big believer in this and then\neveryone can see what you're working on\num and then uh but the key thing is if\nit's not in your active list you don't\nhave meetings about it and you don't\nhave emails about it right like if\npeople have ideas or things they just\nadd it to the card so when that gets up\nto the active list we can work on all\nthe information there we haven't\nforgotten anything and what two word\nuh language do you use to describe this\nfirst point this method I love this I\ncalled it a pull based pull based right\nwhat pulled up you pull into the so\nyou're fixing in advance here's how much\nconcentration I have to give on work and\nyou pull stuff into that the alternative\nis push based which is how most\norganizations run which is when I want\nyou to do something I just push it on to\nyou and now you have to deal with it got\nit um I once heard email described as a\npublic post to-do list yeah that made me\nscared of email in a way that nothing\nelse had um it's newport's pull-based\nsystem I called it that by the way um\nthis is what in the a lot of the advice\nin the first uh one of the chapters of\nthe new book is basically how do you get\naway with implementing this in when you\nhave a boss and there's like all sorts\nof different so you're your own boss so\nyou can just say this is what we're\ndoing here's the board but there's a lot\nof like subtle ways you can do this yeah\num right so that's number one that's\nnumber one the um Cal newport's\npull-based system I'm going to do this\nand I'm actually going to report back on\nthis at some point um you won't see the\npost on social media because you're not\nthere but others will all right so\nthat's one all right number two would be\nmultiscale planning okay so now this is\nplanning uh you're planning on three\ndifferent scales daily\nweekly seasonally or quarterly however\nyou want to think about it right so you\nhave a a plan for like the semester the\nseason or the quarter like this is what\nI'm working on these are the big\nobjectives I want to hit here's the\nreminders to myself about like what\nmatters like remember like I'm I'm\noverhauling my my workout routine we're\ntrying to like this with the podcast you\nlook at that scale of planning every\nweek when you build your weekly plan and\nthe weekly plan it could free form text\nyou don't need anything you know any\nspecial tools your weekly plan you're\nlooking at the actual calendar all right\nuh what from my bigger scale plan my\nseasonal quarterly plan what am I trying\nto make sure I can make progress on this\nweek and you you confront the reality of\nyour week you see where's the empty\nspace where there's the busy space you\nalso change what's on your plate right\nhere you know if I cancel this thing\nthat frees up that whole morning which\nmeans like I could really make progress\non this which I really want to make\nprogress on so great I'm going to cancel\nthat thing on Friday so you're looking\nat the whole week as one unit then every\nday you look at your weekly plan like\nokay so so I'm going to use this when I\nmake my plan for the day and when you do\nyour daily plan you do time\nblocking now I'm every I'm giving a job\nevery minute on my work day not my day\nafter work but every minute on my work\nday I'm time blocking so I call it time\nblocking is you're literally drawing\nblocks around the free time okay this\nI'm working on this this I'm working on\nthis so you're making a plan for your\nday that is informed by the weekly plan\nso in multiscale planning you have like\nthe the big picture things you care\nabout trickle their way all the way down\nto okay I'm what am I going to do during\nthis hour during the day um but you\ndon't have to\nGrapple every this what most people do\nevery time I'm figuring out what to do\nnext I'm not grappling with all these\nscales at the same time what are my\nobjectives what's my big plan what's\ngoing on this week uh you're you're\ndealing with each of these scales when\nthe time is right and so when I find\nfinally gets down to it's now 3:00\nyou're just doing what that block is and\nyou figured out that block earlier today\nwhen you looked at your weekly plan that\nweekly plan reflected what was in your\nsemester plan which you figured out you\nspent a whole afternoon working on at\nthe beginning of the semester so\nmultiscale planning uh it keeps you\nfocus on what matters it prevents you\nfrom wandering through your day and how\nyou disperse your energy um and it gives\nyou control over your time on different\nscales from like canceling major ongoing\nobligations to just being more efficient\nabout what you do during a given day\nuh so I swear by multiscale planning to\ntry to keep this whole lumbering ship\nthat is sort of like Kell Newport um\naiming in the towards the right Shores\nyou know like keep correcting and\nkeeping it aim back I love this I this\nis more or less what I do with my\nphysical workouts every week I know I'm\ngoing to get three resistance training\nsessions two or three cardiovascular\ntraining sessions I know I'm going to\ntrain my legs once it's either going to\nbe on depending on travel Sunday Monday\nor Tuesday I'll train torso muscles in\nthe middle of the week I'll train sort\nof limb accessory muscles on a Saturday\nyeah long run on Sunday or hike on\nSunday or some other day there'll be\nsome sort of hit workout in the middle\nof the week and ideally there's a jog in\nthere too and you can adjust it a little\nbit based on the reality of the week\nyeah I might double up for two days and\ntake a day off I have my ideal schedule\nbut sometimes it gets compromised and um\nand then I do that for 16 we Cycles\nwhere I vary the kind of intensity load\nEtc um and I've done this for years and\nit's just kind of works for me yeah um\nnow with cognitive work I don't tend to\ndo this it tends to be more deadline\nbased yeah but I think that the um the\npull-based system is really going to\nhelp um if I dovetail it with this\nmultiscale planning um I love this and\nyou can see the deadlines now you see\nthem coming right so that's part of\nwhat's nice about multiscale planning is\nyou know the deadlines coming up and so\nwhen you're doing your semester planning\nyou start thinking like okay the big\ndeadlines like when I get to December I\nneed to be really starting getting after\nthis thing that's going to be due a book\ndo yeah so then you know and so this\nreally helps me book writing because now\nwhen I'm planning it's like you know a\nyear in advance I know this month I need\nto get like roughly the rough draft of\nchapter 2 done you know and then that\ntrickles down to my week where I'm going\nto make sure I have enough time cleared\nto like be on track for finishing it and\nthen that trickles into my day now I\nknow to like block those mornings to\nwork on it so it all it all works\ntogether an added bonus of the daily\nscale is I would say communication\nshould get its own block email social\nmedia whatever that's like you\ncommunicating with the outside world\ngoes into your time block plan so if\nyour block doesn't include that you\ndon't do it so it's like this block is\nwriting it's not email it's not social\nmedia so the rule is really simple I'm\nnot going to use email or social media\num but I still need to do email at some\npoint so I have to put a block in for it\nand when I'm in my email blocks I'm\ndoing the email if I need to go on\nsocial media to see what's going on with\nlike the latest episode or something I\ngot to give that time and then you can\nmono Focus because then uh it's a\npsychological hack but basically um when\nyou particularly when you schedule\ncommunication and distraction now the\nonly thing you have the muster willpower\nto do is obey the single rule of I'm\nfollowing my blocks if you don't do that\nif you're like I just sometimes do email\nand social media sometimes I don't now\nwhat you have to do is just constantly\nbe having this debate is now the right\ntime to do this I know I'm going to do\nit at some point today why not now well\nwhat about now what about now like\nyou're just constantly asking yourself\nright that's impossible right that's\ngoing to drain you but if all you have\nto do instead is say my commitment today\nis to follow my blocks and I get I\nreally feel good when I do it and like I\ncheck off a box if I do give yourself\nsome feedback here it's a much easier\ncognitive battle to win than just trying\nto be reasonable about well let me wait\na little longer to check my email like\nyou're going to lose that battle you\nknow eight times out of 10 which is like\nenough to to Really overcome it so\nthat's like a a hidden bonus of time\nblocking is now you can really get your\narms around separating different\ncognitively distinct activities this is\nwhere the analogy of Tim restricted\neating comes to mind yep um again not\nthat that's the best way to lose weight\nor maintain weight or it's its role in\nlongevity is still debated Etc but I\nthink for many people not all but for\nmany people the decision that they do\nnot eat during certain time blocks and\nthey do eat in other time blocks is just\nfar more tractable in the real world for\nthem than trying to limit portion size\ndecide whether or not they're going to\neat they're going to pass the cookie and\nhave a little bit nope they're they're\nin their fasting it's just it simplifies\nthe issue yep and as a consequence I\nthink it improves um Behavior overall\nalthough the clinical trials point to\nsome mixed results with that last\nstatement again I don't want the uh\nnutritionista after me the point is the\ntime blocking and the and the the the\nthick\nblacklined of the yes no the binary yes\nno as um eat don't eat or single commit\nemail communicate don't communicate in a\ngiven time block I think that's that\nreally um is what it's about it it\nhonors the the uh the power of of those\nsorts of neural\ncomputations all right and there's\nanother hidden bonus of time blocking\ntoo is visually distinct blocks so what\nI do for example is I put a double thick\nline around deep work blocks focusing on\nsome not just deep work but deep work on\nthings I really care about just this\ngives you a visual record how much deep\nwork am I doing right like it's this\ndiagnosis I use a a paper based time\nblock planner so uh you flip through\nthose pages and you're just looking for\ndark blocks right so you see if I see I\ndon't have a lot of dark blocks I say\nthis is my whole job like my whole life\nI've been trained in a lab to think\nreally hard about things and write\nthings why do I not have very many dark\nblocks you get this feedback mechanism\nso there's all these bonuses when you\nstart doing this type of doing this type\nof planning before you tell us about\nnumber three I often have fantasized\nabout a web-based program that seems to\nrun countercurrent to much of what\nyou're talking about but goes back to\nthis the Whiteboard MIT Observer stuff\nthat you talked about at the beginning\nwhich is I often longed for okay I need\nto write today I need to write a book or\nI'm going to do some podcast prep I'm\ngoing to pop up a few Windows of other\npeople that are also doing deep work and\nwe're not going to communicate in fact\nif we do or if music comes through on\nthe microphone or somebody coughs that's\ngoing to be considered a distraction but\ndoes anyone want to join me for some\ndeep work yes where we don't communicate\nand I've often thought I would just pay\nsomeone to be there yeah to just sit\nthere and um but I haven't done that\nthere are multiple companies that do\nthis okay yeah it's interesting where\nyou you're you're\nonline with uh or in person with just\nother people doing deep work so a deep\nwork Club the challenge is synchronizing\nschedules because I might want to do\nthis with somebody on the east coast and\nthey might not be doing deep work at the\nsame time and a recording isn't the same\nbecause then you know they're not really\nwatching but but there's something\nreally to this right I especially for at\nhome workers or people like me that work\noften in isolation students do this\nright dissertation boot camps I don't\nknow if if you had this experience but\nGeorgetown does a lot of colleges do\nthis uh okay everyone working on their\ndissertation we're all going to get\ntogether and we're going to work on it\ntogether because they would often have\nme come speak at these things earlier in\nmy career it would just be a bunch of\ngrad students they were just coming to\nthe same space and they would work for\nlike okay 90 minutes and then they would\nhave like a speaker come in or lunch and\n90 so the the group cohesion of everyone\nworking deeply at the same time writers\nRetreats are the same way we all go to\nthe same house in the middle of nowhere\num so that we're all just going to\nencourage each other to write because\nthat's all what everyone's doing here\nyeah so social pressure I'm with you I\nwas thinking if I ever needed to you\nknow put a big extension on my house\nthat's that's what I should do just like\nokay pay me money and I will sit there\non zoom and do deep work with you this\nis my secret plan I'd pay money I'd pay\nmoney to do deep work in parallel with\nyou by with a virtual window there\nthere's Cal in his office doing that I\nthink there's something nice about\nhaving some knowledge of who people are\nyou know like hey logging in today yeah\nyeah all right let's get down to it set\nthe timer and go and then you know a to\nthem out you know working at the library\nacademic libraries why do people do that\nright just everyone there is working\nright yeah now I'm a big believer in\nthat there's really something sticky to\nthat okay number three all right I have\na shutdown\nritual which clearly demarcates uh the\nend of work in the start of the night\nafter\nwork and the shutdown ritual so it has\nto uh you have to close open Loops right\nso you got to make sure this is like a a\nreview type period and let me look back\nat my inbox and look at my plan let me\nlook at my you know my time block and my\ncalendar um really make sure I there's\nnothing urgent that needs to be dealt\nwith that I didn't and there's nothing\nthat's just in my head that I don't want\nto forget that's not written down\nsomewhere like take care of all of that\nright so you review all these things you\nget what am I going to do tomorrow you\ndon't have to build your whole plan for\ntomorrow you have a sense for it um and\nthen you need some sort of\ndemonstrative thing you do to indicate\nthat you finished the routine right\nright so my my longtime newsletter\nreaders know I used to actually have a\nphrase I would say schedule shutdown\ncomplete like a crazy phrase right it's\nnot how normal people talk right um now\nI have a planner that has like a\ncheckbox that says shut down complete\nnext to it the reason why that it's a\ndemonstrative anchor is that you use\nthis then for cognitive behavioral\ntherapy because at first people have a\nhard time shutting down work I mean I\ninvented this because I had a very hard\ntime shutting down working on my\ndissertation I just what if this proof\ndoesn't work and blah blah blah so what\nyou do is when you're you get a\nrumination post shutdown hey what about\nwhat's going on with our work are we\ndoing the right thing do we forget this\nor that instead of engaging in the\nrumination well it's like no I think\nwe're okay let me think about my\nschedule tomorrow what's my plan you\ninstead can just say um I said that\ncrazy phrase or I checked that box I\nwouldn't have said that phrase unless I\nhad gone through everything and made\nsure that I had a good plan and\nnothing's being missed and it was okay\nto shut down work because of that I'm\nnot going to engage with you rumination\nI said the weird thing let's get back to\nwhat we're doing this is like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy that after a month or\nso you are really able to actually uh\neffortlessly disengage from work and do\neverything you know all the other stuff\nthat matters right without having the\nconstant ruminations about work which\ngives your mind an actual break to you\nknow do other things so I mean this is\nmore mental health and productivity but\nfor me it was critical I mean I can\nreally remember when I came up with this\nyou know exactly where I was in my grad\nstudent career and there's just too much\ntoo many ideas and concerns that were\njust roing and like once I did this you\nknow it took a few weeks and then I\ncould actually like shut down and go on\nand do other things yeah the par\nassociative nature of the brain can make\nit um really problematic if you're\nthinking about work at the dinner table\nyou start to associate the dinner table\nwith work I mean when Matt Walker came\nhere to do this six-part series that's\nsoon to be released um and we were\ndiscussing insomnia he said you know one\nof the major issues with insomnia is\npeople who have trouble falling asleep\nor staying asleep will often stay in bed\nwhen they can't sleep and then the bed\nbecomes associated with challenges with\nsleep that you know hence the\nrecommendation that virtually every\nsleep coach and sleep scientist um\nrecommends that people actually if they\ncan't sleep for 20 minutes or so of\neffort then you get up and leave the bed\nand go someplace else until until you\nfeel sleepy enough to go back and try or\nfall asleep on the couch elsewhere yeah\num I put put that in as a as a as a note\nto you um but um this seems incredibly\nimportant also for enrichment of of\nrelationships with spouses and children\nand people in your life I mean the the\nproblem is the first thing that we ask\npeople when they walk in the door\ntypically was how was work today yeah\nhow was work what' you do today yeah\ntell me about your school day tell me\nabout your work maybe we need to come up\nwith better questions yeah like here's\nsomething interesting we could do or\nhere's like something I read about\nunrelated the work yeah no I think that\nI think it makes a huge difference uh\nand again there's all these meta\nbenefits for these things so so one of\nthe meta benefits for all of these is\nalso these are all very structured\nyou'll begin to build a reputation as\nsomeone who is very careful about how\nthey manage themselves in their time\nlike if you're doing multiscale planning\nand certainly if you're doing you know\npull-based workload management people\nare going to start thinking this is\nsomeone who thinks a lot about like how\nthey managed their workday and how\nthings happen this gives you massive\nleeway right yeah because we we think\nwhat like our colleagues want from us is\naccessibility but really why they want\naccessibility is because they have no\nclarity about you know are we going to\ndo this thing are we going to remember\nto do this thing um am I going to have\nto keep bothering you you know what if I\ndon't really think you have your act\ntogether I just wish you would just do\nthis right away or respond to me right\naway because I'm going to have to worry\nabout this until I hear back from you\nthat you did it like accessibility is\nborn from lack of trust or lack of\nclarity right so if you have the\nreputation of someone who really has to\nact together you can for example lean\ninto a shutdown I don't do email at all\nand people they don't think that you're\nbeing lazy or that you're not keeping up\nwith the work you're like no like Andrew\nhas his act together with this stuff I\ntrust him when you show him something\nlike this workload management system\nlike this is where the queue is like I\ncan't get to this yet like okay that's\nreasonable like you have your act\ntogether so there's this meta benefit of\nstarting to get a little bit more\nstructured about your your time and\ncognitive work is that people will give\nyou more flexibility to work with the\nbetter you get at actually working with\nyou know the resources you have as your\nreputation grows um your autonomy grows\nyeah and of course as your reputation\ngrows um more gets thrown at you and it\nprobably takes a bit more discipline to\nto enforce these things but I always\nremind myself and other people that you\nknow the reason people want to access\nyou is because of presumably the\nconsequences of the deep work you did\nyeah not um but people love meetings\ngosh do they um I won't do brainstorm\nmeetings anymore unless it's with my\nclose team it's like you can pitch me a\ncontract and we can reverse engineer the\nidea you know um but it just doesn't\nwork to to meet with people and kind of\nbrainstorm stuff and but I don't know\nwhat this is like I think maybe people\nare taking their own lack of structure\nand um projecting it onto other people\nas a way to fill the time yeah it's p\nproductivity as well like this is what I\nhave like visible activity and so let's\ncan we have meetings let's talk let's\nhop on calls like that all feels useful\nwhen ultimately it's not like I'm with\nyou on it like remember the reason why\neveryone wants to talk to me is because\nnot I'm so great at brainstorming\nmeetings you know people like this is\ngreat like Andrew's great at\nbrainstorming meeting so that's why you\nwant to bother no it's because you were\nreally good at the podcasting you were\ndoing like the Deep thing and then that\nbrings in the better you get at what you\ndo best the more the world conspires to\ntake away your time to actually work on\nit uh like professors know this well\nlike pre- 10 year they most big\nuniversities are pretty good at\npreaching the professors all that's\ngoing to matter is going to be your\nresearch but they throw a ton of other\nstuff at you at that time it depends on\nthe school like I would say like\nGeorgetown is very good about this they\nlike we don't uh from our perspective\nit's a waste of resources to hire you\nand and and have you not get tenure so\nlike we want to try to protect you from\nthey keep service requirements low for\nexample and like just focus on you know\njust focus on your research because\nthat's what's going to matter at least\nprofessors know this right like uh\nthere's a clear process like the tenure\nprocess most people don't understand\ntenure they think it's like getting\npromoted at a job and there's like all\nthese different ways you can sort of\nimpress your boss it's none of that\nright I mean it's these confidential\nletters from leading scholars in your\nfield that are doing nothing but\nbrutally assessing your research how\ngood is Cal who are two people who are\nbetter than him on the market right now\nwho are like two people he's slightly\nbetter than would you tenure him at your\nUniversity what university could he get\ntenured at I mean it's all that matters\nis yeah research quality um so you have\nto some somehow ReDiscover what that is\nif you're not a professor like\nultimately like this is the thing I do\nbest for my company so let me do that\nlet me do that really well there's also\nan aspect by the way of uh if you do a\ndeep thing really well that does not\nattract as much work as if what you do\nis you're just really good at like\nresponding ing to people's things and\nputting out fires it's like you don't\nwant to get too much trapped in that\ngame unless that's the game you want to\nplay you know if you get trapped in the\ngame of how I distinguish myself is I\nreply right away doesn't matter when it\nis I make your life easier you're\nplaying the game and making other\npeople's lives easier and that's what\nthey're going to ask you to do but if\ninstead you play the game of I'm\ncompetent with this like I'll respond to\nthe emails and not be uh I won't be\npathological about it but the real thing\nyou care about is like this code on\nproducing or these reports on producing\nare just really Second To None then\nyou're not going to get a much of the\nsmall stuff they're like okay well do\nthat then you know like that's what we\nwant that's what we want you to work on\nso like what is your equivalent of\nresearch is probably a really key\nquestion for a lot of people how do you\ntreat um social engagements through work\nlike you know like the company barbecue\nI don't know anyone does company\nbarbecues anymore but um you know like\nhappy hour or I don't know if anyone\ndoes that either um and social\nengagements with family like you know\nbecause obviously those things are\nimportant too yeah um are those on your\nschedule well you know I treat uh work\nschedule different from not on work\nschedule right so my work schedule is\nthis time block plan part of a\nmultiscale plan um really dialed in like\nwhen I'm working I'm working right um\nbut then when I'm not working I'm way\nmore LAX you know so I don't do time\nblock planning of my weekends or my\nevenings uh the work shutdown being\nclear gives you more flexibility there\nso I like okay what do we want to do\nlike let's go like see people do the\nthings with the family um I like to be\nflexible and not overly planned outside\nof the work day but then during the\nworkday itself you know it's much more\nmachine like so you're you're fairly um\nnot LAX but you're a bit more relaxed\naround social engagements and engaging\nwith the kids but at at work or when\nyou're working at home or or in the\noffice you're you're obese yeah I'm like\na black box in the workday like when I'm\nwhen I'm working like I disappear nice\nyeah and then when I'm done like I'm I'm\naround but like my family and friends\nand they've learned like if you text me\nduring the work day I'm I'm not part of\nthat game of like I'll just respond back\nto it people know like it may have been\nfour hours since I saw my phone that's\nlike Lex fredman yeah and people often\nask to get in touch with Lex and I've\nyou know made that connect for a few\npeople but I always point out you know\nLex will go long periods of time where\nwe don't connect and then we're close\nclose friends we spent a lot of time in\nperson on the phone text but I\nunderstand that if I text Lex I might\nnot hear from him for four or five days\nand it's all good yeah you know it's\njust in fact that it tells me he's good\nit's like that that scene at the end of\nGoodwill Hunting where he's like I just\nwant to show up at your house know\nyou're not there and he gets there and\nhe smiles his friend's gone he knows he\nwent the direction of of his of his\nheart you're saying if you start to get\na lot of like memes texted to you from\nLex that's not going to happen you're\ngoing to be like what's going on Lex\nthat's never going to happen What\nstruggle what struggle are you having in\nyour life right now I'm a big believer\nin the phone I'm old school I pick up\nthe phone make a call we'll get on a\ncall sometimes FaceTime um we do text\none or two things back it's often really\nquick yeah really quick and I have other\nfriends in the podcast space for which\nit's the same it's just um phone is a\ngreat tool yep and you know drop in and\nthen get back to it not a lot of chitter\nchatter on I like that I always like\ntext is like a great logistical tool you\nknow like wait what what restaurant are\nyou at oh you know okay I'll meet you\nthere or are you free to talk like I\nlove text as a logistical tool but\nyou're right as a conversational tool\nyeah it's not for me either\nand do you take vacations where you are\non pure vacation so just with family or\nor maybe even Solo or with your spouse\nwhere it's but no digital\nanything uh yeah digital is not a\nproblem for me on vacation but my wife\nwon't let me not bring something to work\non on vacation because because I become\na monster got it your brain needs that\nit needs it yeah when we had little kids\nI tried this right I was like okay like\nthis is it I'm not going to think about\nanything like this is and I would just\nbecome a like an xiety case so what I've\nlearned is bring one thing that's like\nvery deep and non-urgent um like a book\nconcept I'm trying to make work or an\nacademic paper that I was like trying to\ncrack or like something new and I need\nlike that 90 minutes a day to like walk\non the beach and think and I have to\nhave a notebook I have it with me in\nhere I have to have a notebook with me\nso that like I can capture notes and get\nthem out of my head on vacation and that\nnow we have a happy medium like I work a\nlittle bit every day no email I don't\nget not email not no deep work thinking\nuh I'm much happier it's an itch that\nyou have to scratch yeah if I'm not\nwriting or thinking it's it's I I get\ncognitively antsy I get anxious you know\nlike I'm on I've been now I'm talking to\nyou now but I've been you know traveling\ndoing some podcast and stuff like this\nand I'm way out of my cognitive comfort\nzone here because I'm not vlogging like\nearly in this trip I I was uh on a New\nYorker and Atlantic deadline like riding\nall the time you know California time up\nat 5:00 a.m. like you know and I'm done\nwith that now and I'm really cognitively\nay like I just feel out of sorts right\nnow you know like I'm not working I'm\nnot\nthinking love\nit Cal I for me this has been such an\nhonor I mean I should have said this at\nthe beginning of the episode but I've\nbeen such a fan for such a long time um\nlong before we met or communicated at\nall uh I started reading your books and\num I would say you and Tim Ferris are\nthe people who early in my academic\ncareer had such a profound influence on\nhow I approach work and and it required\nthat I do things um kind of Against the\nGrain people around me and very quickly\nI saw um that I was making progress much\nfaster than I would have otherwise yeah\nand I never looked at as a competitive\nEndeavor with others but and um youve\njust continue to churn out valuable\ninformation actionable tools you know in\nbook and after book after book and um\nand obviously they require some\nstructure and some some restriction but\nalso some moving toward um action items\nand I love these these top three that\nyou provided us on the the pull forward\nthe uh multiscale planning and and the\nshutdown ritual and all all the others\num that you put forth and I guess the\nthe um major takeaway for me today is is\nthat yes you've developed all these\ntools but you also use them and um it's\nnot lost on me that you also have a\nflourishing career as a computer\nscientist so you're not just somebody\nwho talks about and here I'm not dissing\nanyone else in the in the information\nsphere like just talks about habits or\njust talks about protocols you do these\nthings and you implement them in the\ncontext of your work life your creative\nlife your family life and your\nrelationship to self and you exercise\nand um and I think that that all\ncombines to to be an amazing example of\nwhat's possible if we introduce um a bit\nof understanding about how we function\nas a as a being um and that we Implement\nsome of these tools in in the user\nmanual that that you've come up with and\nso I just want to say on behalf of\nmyself and everyone who's listening and\nwatching you know thank you so much this\nis incredibly valuable information\nregardless of what one is doing in life\nand um I'm certainly going to implement\nthis um three-step uh system and I do\nhave the book I always like to read\nbooks after guests are on I'm going to\nread the book um and I'm going to do\nsome posts about uh what I uh experience\nas a consequence so thank you so much I\nwould pay a substantial amount of money\nto do deep work sessions with you in the\non the screen there but I won't put that\non you I'm just going to I'm going to\njust bite down and and uh and do this\nstuff so thank you so much for being a\nPioneer in the space and for such a\nclear Communicator we all owe you a debt\nof gratitude oh thanks Andrew well and\nfor the rest of us professors who are\nalso podcasting we owe you a Deb of\ngratitude because you're showing us\nwhat's actually uh what's actually\npossible so this has been great meeting\nyou as well has been fantastic right\nwell thank you we won't um we won't
