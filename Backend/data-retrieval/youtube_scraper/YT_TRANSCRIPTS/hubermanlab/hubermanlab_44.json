    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Becky\nKennedy Dr Becky Kennedy is a clinical\npsychologist specializing in parent\nchild relationships she received her\ndegrees and did her training at Duke\nUniversity and Columbia University in\nNew York she is the author of the\nbestselling book good inside a Guide to\nBecoming the parent you want to be she\nis also the founder and creator of an\nonline learning platform also called\ngood inside at which parents and parents\nto be can learn the best possible\nparenting skills that are grounded in\nthe fields of Clinical Psychology that\nhave been proven to work in the real\nworld and that can allow people to\nnavigate common sticking points in\nparent child relationships during\ntoday's discussion you will learn a\ntremendous amount of actionable\nknowledge of about what it is to be a\ngood parent this is a conversation that\npertains not just to parents and parents\nto be but also uncles aunts grandparents\nand also those of you not planning to or\nwho do not want children I say that\nbecause while everything we discussed\ntoday is grounded in the discussion\naround parent child relationships it\nindeed pertains to all of us and\nrelationships of all kinds including\nromantic relationships friendships\nworkplace relationships and our\nrelationship to self Dr Kenedy defines\nfor us and makes clear and actionable\nwhat the exact job of good parenting is\nand how that relates to other\nrelationships that we might have she\nexplains how to set healthy boundaries\nand in fact defines exactly what healthy\nboundaries are there's a lot of\nmisconception about that we also talk a\nlot about empathy and the need to make\nchildren and ourselves feel safe in all\nkinds of relating we discuss how to\nnavigate disagreements and arguments\napologies and punishments reward and on\nand on all framed within a real world\nrealtime context what I mean by that and\nwhat I think really sets apart Dr Becky\nKennedy's work from so much else that\nyou'll see out there on parent child and\nother types of relationships is that she\nmakes what to do and say and what not to\ndo and say in a variety of real world\ncontexts very clear such that you can\naccess that knowledge and do those\nspecific things and avoid those specific\nthings even when things get tense in\nfact especially when things get\ndifficult or tense by the end of today's\nepisode you will have learned a dozen or\nmore very potent clinically backed tools\nto navigate parent child relating\nincluding your relationship to your own\nparents alive or dead and your\nrelationship to self before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is matina\nmatina makes loose leaf and ready to\ndrink yeram mate I often discuss ybba\nmate's benefits such as

makes medical grade red\nlight therapy devices now if there's one\nthing I've consistently emphasized on\nthis podcast is the incredible role that\nlight can have on our biology and of\ncourse I'm always telling people that\nthey should get sunlight in their eyes\nas soon as possible after waking on as\nmany days of their life as possible for\nsake of setting circadian rhythm daytime\nmood focus and alertness and improv\nsleep now in addition to sunlight red\nlight and near infrared light has been\nshown to have positive effects on\nimproving numerous aspects of Cellar and\norgan Health including faster Muscle\nRecovery improved skin health and wound\nhealing even improvements in acne or\nthat is removal of acne reducing pain\nand inflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets juv apart and why it's\nmy preferred red light therapy device is\nthat it has clinically proven\nwavelengths meaning it uses specific\nwavelengths of red light and near\ninfrared light in combination that\ntrigger the optimal seller adaptations\npersonally I use the handheld Juve every\nday the handheld ju is about the size of\na thick piece of toast and I also own a\nju panel that allows for full body\nexposure and I use that one\napproximately only five times per week\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes per session\nif you would like to try ju you can

wake up in the\nmorning although not always sometimes if\nI'm going to exercise I'll drink coffee\nfirst thing in the morning but I love\nlove love coffee and what I've\npersonally found is that by using the\narero Press I can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee I don't know what\nexactly it is in the Aero press that\nallows the same beans to be prepared\ninto a cup of coffee that

Dr\nBecky Kennedy welcome thank you so\nexcited to be here I have a lot of\nquestions for you and as I mentioned in\nmy introduction much of what we are\ngoing to discuss today relates to parent\nchild relating but pertains to\nrelationships generally so people with\nchildren without children who don't want\nchildren hopefully there aren't people\nthat hate children but for all people uh\nout there with children or not planning\nthem or\nnot relationships are really just\nfundamental to who we are and I actually\nplace relationships including\nrelationship to self in what we now\nthink of as the six pillars of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\num sleep nutrition exercise\nrelationships clearly vital to all\naspects of life so I'd like to start off\nby just\nasking for all of us are there some\nsimple or perhaps not so simple\nquestions that uh we can reflect on that\ngive us a sense of you know how good a\nparent we are or would be based on I\ndon't know our our previous parent child\nrelationships our relationship to self\nyou know like what kind of things come\nto Bear when we think about really\nhealthy relationships um I can you know\nstart rattling off a list of what I\nimagine they could be but what are your\nthoughts like what are the what's the\nparameter space as as we say how should\nwe think about relationships besides\njust oh you know I either like this\nperson or don't or I feel good around\nthem or I don't or separating how I feel\nabout them versus how they make me feel\nyou know we can drill a little deeper\nbelow the the kind of U more superficial\nstuff that we often see out there the\nfirst thing that comes to mind when you\nsay that is this word sturdiness and to\nme when someone says like what is good\ninside as an approach and that's always\nthe first word that comes to mind and I\nknow that's like an odd word it's not a\nword we like use a lot although I do\nthink most people when you say that\nperson's like a really sturdy person I\nthink we all have some connotation or\nfeeling at least of what that means and\nI use it a lot being a sturdy parent\nbeing a sturdy leader I talk a lot about\nthe similarities to Parenting and kind\nof being a pilot of a plane and and that\nword stdio comes up and so I remember a\nlittle while ago someone pushed me\nthey're like what's your definition of\nwhat that means and at that point I\nthought wow I should probably have a\ndefinition given I I use it a lot but\nwhat I think it really means is\ninability to be connected to yourself\nand to someone else at the same time and\nI think that is really the definition of\nsturdy leadership and that is the key\nthing that's present in a healthy\nrelationship that at\nonce I kind of know my values what I\nwant what I need I feel like I can be\ntrue to that and at the same time I can\nkind of connect to someone else who\nprobably has different wants and needs\nand maybe even slightly different values\nat the same time and the thing that that\nleads me to next is what I think about\nis like family jobs and a parent job\nso in almost any other place you could\nassume if I'm getting a new job at this\ncompany like there's just no way I could\ndo my job well if I don't know what my\njob is right if you go to your desk and\nyour boss like have a good day do a good\njob and there's no job description you'd\nbe like I like that's impossible but\nover and over with parents if I say to\nthem well what is your job with your kid\nor when your kid is having a tantrum or\nthey hit or they're rude or they lie to\nyour face or anything like what is your\njob in that moment most people very\nwell-intentioned educated people who\nwould never ever take a job if they\ndidn't have a job description they look\nat me they're like I have I have no idea\nso how can we do it well how can we then\nperform it to a place to get to the\noutcomes we want if you don't have the\nfoundation of what your job is and to me\nI I I thought a lot about it I think\nparents actually have two jobs and it\nrelates to sturdiness so you'll you'll\nconnect it where one of our jobs is\nboundaries and to\nme boundaries are things we tell people\nwe will do and they require the other\nperson to do nothing and that's like\nreally important because a lot of times\nwe think we're setting a boundary when\nactually we're making a request and\nboundaries keep us connected to\nourselves they represent our values and\nour wants and our needs and in a parent\nchild relationship they also keep our\nkids safe if I I just know in a simple\nway like my kids watched enough TV today\nand they really have to get to bed and I\nknow that like I don't want them to stay\nup late I kind of know what my family\nneeds I have to set a boundary but the\nother part of my job is like empathy and\nvalidation which is a way of connecting\nto someone else where you see someone\nelse's feelings and experience as real\nyou don't agree with it probably you\ndon't necessarily condone the behavior\nthat's the representation of the\nfeelings but the feelings themselves you\nneed to connect to and I feel like those\nare our two jobs as parents and that's\nreally the way to be a sturdy leader and\nto be in a sturdy healthy relationship\nwith your kids wow so much there uh and\nI love it uh and here's one of the\nreasons I love it this notion of\nsturdiness something that I don't think\nwe hear enough about um you know we hear\nabout resilience grit um also important\nterms um but sturdiness as as you've\ndescribed it and the job of parenting um\nreally seems to include a lot of um\nverbs not just nouns and adjectives and\nI and I'm a huge fan of verbs because\nbiology and to some extent psychology um\nyes also psychology is all about verbs\num and so the labels often are um\nmysterious but sturdiness it you know\njust sends a clear message of of\nsomething that um doesn't budge easily\num but then as you describe the job of\nbeing a parent having boundaries and I'd\nlike to drill into that a little bit\nmore what how you view boundaries um but\nalso empathy uh it's not a walled off um\npicture it's one that that is\nsemi-permeable um also uh and I confess\nI'm a bit obsessed with um old school\npsychoanalytic theory not as the the the\nbe all end all of psychology but but it\nalso suggests um like this other other\nrelationship like I'm a person I have a\nself you're a person you have a self\nthis is the opposite of codependency\nwhere obviously dependency and two\npeople being quote unquote codependent\ncan be healthy in the context of relying\non one another but uh as I understand it\nwhen one person has a self and another\nperson doesn't have a self or this\nnotion of merging not just in romantic\nrelationships but child parent\nrelationships you know I'm best friends\nwith my mom or dad is that a good thing\nI don't know but this notion of other\nother relationships it's like I self\nyou're a self and we each see each other\nas another um anyway I I think there's\nso much to explore here so valuable um\nyou mentioned that boundaries are\nsomething that we do and that the\nrequires that the other do nothing um\ncan we go a little bit further into that\nbecause um it's a beautiful concept and\num this notion of boundaries but like uh\ngaslighting narcissism and all the other\nthings that we hear about nowadays I\nthink is are often badly misunderstood\nso tell tell us more about boundaries\nand uh how that looks in the in the\naction sense of it and this is all so\nconnected to what you're saying that\nother other relationship I'm a person\nyou're a person and so many times that's\nactually is what gets merged and so my\nkid gets upset that I say they can't\nwatch another show and and apparent\nreally in that moment it's like they're\nwhose feelings are whose like they were\nupset was I was upset a second ago I\nthought I should set the boundary and\nnow all of a sudden I'm changing my mind\nthere is this complete role kind of\nconfusion and merger which is one of the\nmain reasons that kids get actually\nreally scared and escalate their\nbehavior because they don't have a\nsturdy leader when they really need one\nright so boundaries are what we tell\nsomeone we will do and they require the\nother person to do nothing I like this\ndefinition for a lot of reasons I'm just\nvery practical so it allows me after I\nset a boundary to like assess was that a\nboundary or not right because let's take\num let's take the TV example it's\nwhatever time at night my kid has just\nwatched a show and they know they were\nsupposed to watch one show and and then\nyou know turn off the\nTV I hear from parents a lot my kid\ndoesn't listen or my kid doesn't respect\nmy boundaries and I'll say okay like\nthat sounds hard let's get into that so\nthen they'll say so I told my kid to\nshut off the\nTV they just kept watching they just\nkept on I told my kid to stop jumping on\nthe couch and they kept jumping they\ndon't respect my boundaries they don't\nlisten to me this is like a beautiful\nexample of like this is a problem I\nagree but this is not a boundary problem\nyou made a request of your child and\nfrankly if you have your I'm making this\nup seven-year-old watching TV I'm not so\ngood at putting away TV in a phone at\nnight like it's just hard for me to do\nso your seven-year-old probably is just\nyou know addicted to what's ever\nhappening and we're kind of asking our\nkid to do our job for us because we\ndon't want our kid to be mad at us or\nwhatever it is a boundary in that\nsituation would be saying O you didn't\nput off the TV look by the time I get\nover there if you haven't turned off the\nTV and I don't want to do this but I\nwill I will take the remote out of your\nhand and shut it off a boundary is\nsaying O after my request doesn't work\ncan you get off the couch you can jump\non the floor look if by the time I get\nover there you haven't gotten off the\ncouch I will pick you up that is like I\nwas say I'm not going to put the success\nof my intervention in my like\nseven-year-olds hand I care too much\nabout my own needs and my own role as a\nas a leader in my home to do that right\nsame thing with let's say in-laws my\nmother-in-law doesn't respect my\nboundary show shows up without calling\nnow I don't want to get to this point\nthere's a lot of things in a\nrelationship we can do before we get to\nthis point but if that's really a\nboundary and I have a very kind of\nintrusive mother-in-law a boundary would\nbe saying look this is going to be\nawkward and I know you mean well but the\nnext time you come\nunannounced I will come to your car and\nsay oh this time doesn't work for us you\ncannot come in and I will go back into\nmy house and close the door like now\nthere's going to be lots of feelings\naround that but you are now setting a\ntrue boundary and when we say our kids\ndon't\nlisten those are often situations not\nall them but there's a big percentage\nwhere I'm actually not setting a\nboundary early enough and in a sturdy\nenough way which is what my kid needs\nbecause at that point they simply don't\nhave the skills to inhibit and urge and\nthey need me to be the boundary for them\nwe hear sometimes that U kids are\ncraving rules they're craving boundaries\num I don't know I was kind of a wild\nAdolescent and teenager um maybe a\nlittle more than wild I I don't recall\never craving rules I but I do recall\npaying attention to their lack of\npresence so what of that um you know is\nthis notion that kids really want and\ncrave rules and boundaries is that is\nthat sort of a uh I don't know\nprojection that we put on to them um and\nand I'm not exploring this just just for\nfun I'm exploring it because I think\nthat one thing that's very helpful in\nsetting boundaries especially with kids\nis the idea that gosh even if it's a bit\npainful to see them in discomfort\nthere's that empathy piece that you\ntalked about before that empathic\nAttunement can um get in the way of\nboundaries right these are and they're\nnot mutually exclusive but these are\nsomewhat competing forces set at times\nso if we if we know or if we can\nacknowledge at least explore this idea\nthat rules are deep down what they\nreally want not just what they need yes\num maybe it would help yes and I think\nby the way in my taking you know the\nremote away or taking my kid off the\ncouch just to be clear if I do that to\nmy kid like they are not going to say oh\nmom you are the best mom in the world\nthank you they are going to cry and\nscream and that's where boundaries and\nempathy those two parts of our job\nactually do always go together I think\nthey're actually Partners they're not\nactually at odds because as soon as my\nkid is upset what I would say to them is\noh you wanted to jump on the couch it's\nnot as much fun on the floor oh you\nreally wanted to watch another show you\ndidn't even want it this big you wanted\nto watch it this big it sounds crazy\nbecause you're like wait why am I\nempathizing with that feeling they just\nkind of disobeyed no they're two\ndifferent things I'm doing my job and\nsetting a boundary they're actually\ndoing their job and feeling their\nfeelings that's actually their job the\nonly way you can ever learn to regulate\na feeling is through feeling the feeling\nso they're doing their job now I'm going\nto validate and this is how kids learn\nmotion regulation boundaries they feel I\nvalidate I hold the boundary over and\nover and over so do kids crave rules and\nI I think one of the issues is that most\nparenting approaches have one or the\nother and I think they're both very\nincomplete strategies if you just lead\nwith rules right I don't know who said\nit definitely wasn't me like what is it\nrules without relationship lead to\nRebellion yeah that's what happens right\nso that's not good but I see the stage\nwe've swung the other direction it is\nalso not a complete parent strategy when\nyour kid's jumping on the couch to do\nnothing if you think that's dangerous\nand to say oh you really want to jump\njump jump and such big feelings like\nthat is not what kids need I think kids\ncrave boundaries and they crave feeling\nseen and understood because as kids are\ngrowing up like I think the questions\nthey're always asking parents even\nthough of course they never say this\nit's just am I real and am I safe every\ninteraction that's what they're asking\nus the reason we have to Val validate\ntheir feelings when they're upset even\nthough they're so upset just that their\nstring cheese broke whatever it is is\nfeelings don't have markers like blood\nor like they don't know and so when we\nsay oh you wanted your string cheese to\nbe together what we're really saying is\nthe things you experience inside of you\nare real but kids are also desperate to\nknow like how far do things go no one\nlikes to feel boundaryless as a kid\nthat's terrifying right and so when we\nsaid a boundary we actually say to a kid\nlike I will always protect you like I\nwon't let things get so far out of\ncontrol so I do think I don't know if\nit's rules but kids crave connection and\nI think boundaries and kind of\nvalidation and empathy they are the two\nforms of connection that kids yeah are\nreally desperate\nfor what about rewarding kids and here\nrather than um start off by asking you\nknow what are the best ways to reward\nkids in healthy ways and I will ask that\nin a moment um how can we uh evaluate\nthe notion of of Rewards or incentives\num through this lens of sturdiness\nboundaries and empathy yeah um because\nyou know I could imagine you know a\nreward that's outsized in comparison to\nwhat a kid did you know okay great you\nknow you you took your plate to the\nkitchen sink after dinner um you know\nyou get $10,000 obviously out of scale\nextreme example but just by way of\nexample um you're going to screw up\ntheir reward mechanisms for for for life\nif you ask me that everything I know\nabout reward and neuroplasticity says\nthat that that would occur but but this\nidea that you know you can incentivize\nkids if if you turn off the TV now then\nyou definitely can watch tomorrow night\nwhereas if you don't you can't like so\nyou're sort of merging reward and\npotential punishment um you know\nit how do we bound rewards um and uh how\ndo we take into account that when we\nstart adding rewards to scenarios that\nthat we're we're mixing and matching\nlife experience for them you know okay\nso now doing what I'm told do I always\nexpect a reward um if the reward doesn't\ncome next time we know based on reward\nprediction error we tend to be worse off\nemotionally than had we never received a\nreward in the first place again pretty\npretty vast parameter space but what are\nyour thoughts on best ways to reward\nkids for standard good behavior yeah\nversus\nachievement versus elimination of bad\nbehavior maybe so three categories I\nthink you're asking a much bigger\nquestion or I'm GNA I think you are\nwhich is like what do what why do\nparents think we need to reward kids I\nthink that's why do we think we need to\npunish kids and this is actually where\neverything I work on started from\nbecause the way I was trained to work\nwith parents I went to you know the best\ngold standard evidence-based program and\nit was all about timeouts and\npunishments and rewards and stickers and\nignoring and praise and and honestly\nwhen during the training for the years\nafter I kind of practiced this way my I\nfeel like that you know this better than\nI am so I shouldn't even say this but\nlike that left part of my brain like\nlogic and linearity I was just like this\nis amazing oh my goodness we're going to\nget more of the good behavior and we're\ngoing to not get the bad behavior and\nand I'd start teaching this to parents\nmy private practice\nand there was this little thing in me I\ndon't even know I was like I don't know\nabout this I don't know and it get\nlouder and louder to the point that in a\nsession I literally said to a parent in\nfront of me I was just like telling them\nhow to do a timeout I said I'm sorry I I\ndon't believe anything I've been telling\nyou that's literally what I said cuz I\njust it was so loud and there it was\nobviously super awkward but it led me to\nI feel like from this first principal's\nway be like there are a million\nassumptions that we have about raising\nkids and I think about relationships and\nif I just strip them back what would I\nbe left with and what would be a new\nbuilding from there and rewards and like\npunishments to me are these assumptions\nthat we have somehow converted from like\nthe fiction shelf of the library in my\nmind to like the non-fiction shelf as\nlike truths and I kind of rail against\nall of them so I think I think the\nquestion if that's okay to go that\ndirection to me is like why do we think\nwe need to reward kids and is there\nactually a better system both shortterm\nand long-term I'm incredibly long-term\ngreedy in my parenting approach cuz at\nthe end of the day 18 and up is where\nthings really matter not really matter I\nmean they all matter but I'd rather you\nknow I want to help my kids become\nsturdy resilient adults but I'm\nshort-term greedy too cuz I'm a realist\nlike I just can't deal with like all\nthese difficult moments you get both for\nsure without rewards and punishments so\nI don't know what might someone tell me\nthey give a reward for do you want to\nuse the like clearing the table or\nexample let's start that\nthere it kind of goes back to like\nbelieving kids are inherently good\ninside I really think it goes back to\nthat if you really believe kids are\ninherently good inside which by the way\nwhen I strip back every assumption the\nonly thing I was left was that literally\nthe only thing and then I started to\nthink okay so if they're good inside why\ndo they do so many annoying things like\nall the time but that gave me a gap and\nI feel like that is very exciting to\nhave a gap like why do people who\ngoodness side do such bad things right\nadults or kids and to me right kids are\nborn with all the feelings and none of\nthe skills to manage those feelings like\nperiod and we've often thought therefore\nwhen feelings feelings without skills\ncome out in behaviors I think that's\nwhat bad behaviors are feelings or urges\nor something without a skill to manage\nthem or without access to the skill\nmaybe in that moment either way and then\nwe end up punishing\nBehavior but the behavior was just a\nsign of the lack of\nskill so I can't imagine anyone thinking\nI could teach my kid to swim by\npunishing them for not swimming like I\nthink someone would say that was crazy\num and but that's kind of how we raise\nkids and then we think rewarding them is\ngoing to be effective but it actually\nleads over and over to what you said\nI've seen these parents over and over my\nprivate practice my 14-year-old\nliterally won't pick up their clothes\nfrom the floor unless I give them $5\ndollar like how did I get here and I'm\nlike yeah that's that's a problem but I\nsaw how they got there so let's take\nclearing you know their plate like I\nknow this is going to sound cheesy but\nkids do have something in them where\nthey want to feel like a purposeful\nmeaningful part of society they do\nimpact drives adults and it drives kids\nit's not the same type of rewarding as\nplaying fortnite it's a totally\ndifferent system but I think the\nquestion is like why do we think we have\nto bribe kids or you know kind of trick\nthem into doing things that are kind of\nlike basic parts of human life and so if\nwe take that and my kid chronically\nisn't clearing their plate I could say\nto them\nlook every time you clear a plate I'm\ngoing to give you a sticker after five\nstickers you're going to get I don't\nknow whatever it\nis to me like a much more just effective\nway is I'd say to my kid hey I know you\nknow like clearing a plate is just one\nway of being part of this family and\ntaking care of stuff I know you know\nthat we're on the same team I say that\nphrase we're on the same team right we\nare um something's getting in your way\nremembering I'm going to assume I like\nlike the most generous interpretation\nthat to me allows you to separate\nsomeone's bad behavior from their good\nidentity then I going say what would\nhelp you remember we literally did this\nwith my son who always had his towel on\nthe floor and I was just like I bet he\njust doesn't remember he literally\ndoesn't see it we talked about it and\nhe's like we talked about him putting a\nPost-It literally something simple like\na Post-It on my door that just says pick\nup my towel he wrote it in his own\nhandwriting right trying to facilitate\nhim like solving his own problems and\nnow he has a much higher rate of picking\nup his towel like I guess I could have\nsaid every time you pick up your towel\nyou'll I don't know get a dollar or\nwhatever it is but again it makes me\nthink I'm not building the generalizable\nskill that way I'm just kind of offering\nsomething at the end which sets me on\nthis kind of awful cycle that I think\nkind of misses the point I'd like to\ntake a brief moment and thank one of our\nsponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that also\ncontains adaptogens\nI started taking ag1 way back in 2012\nthe reason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day is that\nit ensures that I meet all of my quotas\nfor vitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 1\nsupports so many different systems\nwithin the body that are involved in\nmental health physical health and\nperformance to try ag1 go to drink\na1.com huberman and you'll get a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free\ntravel packs of ag1 again that's drink\na1.com\nhuberman I love the idea that kids want\npurpose um and am I correct in wondering\nif that goes back to this am I real\ncomponent of the am I real am I safe yes\nlike one way that we know we are real is\nour ability to impart change on the\nworld around us I don't want to get too\nabstract here but you know as a\nneuroscientist I've often sat back and\nreflected like all the emotions we feel\nlike no one sees that or knows that\nunless we say something we write\nsomething we sing something we shout\nsomething you know all the forms of\nexpression just like none of our um our\ndreams are creative uh insights or or\nwishes um exist except inside US unless\nwe transmute them into something\nsomething in the real world so there\ndoes seem to be something about having\nthis nervous system from a time we're\nreally young like it it's seeing our\neffect on the world that that really\nmakes us real and on others and um I\nlove the idea that well and I must say I\nabsolutely believe in my heart and I\njust feel it as a feeling that kids are\ninherently good inside like I just I\ncan't imagine any other version of that\nbut does that mean that there are people\nout there who believe that kids are\ninherently bad or or at least not good I\nI mean like how could that be but then\nagain maybe I'm just naive uh I don't\nknow if anyone consciously believes that\nbut when I go back to that system I was\nfirst trained in rewards and punishments\nlike it feels like a system of\nBehavioral control and to me like I've\nalways thought about control and Trust\nas opposites so I only control what I\ndon't trust so nobody said to me in that\nprogram by the way Becky everything\nyou're learning Here We Believe kids are\nbad inside and so we do this thing\nbut well if I don't trust my kid and if\nI don't trust they inherently have the\nthings in them to do good by the way\nthat's not going to happen naturally\nthat's why we have a big job as a parent\nto coach our kids to bring that out to\nset boundaries when they can't do it and\nso many other things but I don't believe\nanyone would say yeah it's because\nthey're bad inside but there is a nature\nwhere you're constantly interacting with\nyour kid from that other system looking\nat them like I don't trust you I don't\ntrust you and when you do bad things I\ncannot hold on to the fact that you have\na good identity that's why I'm giving\nyou a punishment that's why I'm sending\nyou away to your room and so if I'm\nreflecting back to you constantly that\nyou are just your latest behavior that I\ndon't trust you that I kind of have to\nbribe you to do very basic human things\nwell our kids form their identity from\nour reflection of them and so then we're\nthis is what really compelled all of\nthis I'm like we're raising generation\nafter generation of kid kind of saying\nto them like you're kind of a bad\nuntrustworthy kid and then we wonder why\nwe have such high rates of like massive\nmental health problems well like I\nthere's some linearity there I'm curious\nabout this notion of impingement I I've\nheard about this um you know this idea\nthat you know when we're young we're\nforging life deciding you know do I like\nthe way this tastes or not tastes you\nknow by the way I still hate anchovies I\ndon't need to be asked again to know the\nanswer but when you're young you know\nwe're encouraged to do things like eat\nyour broccoli taste the anchovy and some\nparents it seems are very comfortable\nwith the idea of allowing their children\nto have their feelings and their wishes\nthey their as I always say the nervous\nsystem seems to be divided into yum\nyucks and me Mez I guess the plur will\nbe me um yum yucks and Mez I mean it's\nmore complicated than that but like with\npeople where either like yeah I really\nlike them or no something's off there\nlike you know um so it's not that much\nmore nuanced than that the brain's got\nto make decisions afterward after all\nexcuse me so um you know kids have their\nyums yucks and Mez and then we've got\nour our ideas about what they need to do\nin order to progress through life often\ninherited from our parents and hopefully\nModified by the wonderful work that\nyou're doing and writing about and in\nyour your program um then we're talking\nabout here but you know how\nmuch space should we allow for kids to\nbe un\nimpinged like like you don't want to eat\nyou don't want to eat what we're eating\nfor dinner like okay I'm not going to\ncook you an entire new dinner but then I\nguess like you might go to bed hungry\nsounds harsh right um but the other\nversion is okay what would you like for\ndinner well I prefer let's say they pick\na healthy option they prefer pasta not\nchicken okay we won't do the ice cream\nchicken you know uh thing um do we do it\nright like how much impingement I don't\nwant to watch a movie with the family I\nwant to play in my room you know at some\nlevel you know I've heard it both ways\nthat impingement is needed for safety\nand life progression but there's times\nwhen it it's uh it's more subtle than\nthat it's not about safety and life\nprogression it's not about going to\nschool or not going to school homework\nor no homework it's about like do you\nwant to come with us to the park you\nwant to play at home in your room how\noften should we impinge um how do we\nknow um this this kind of the the tricky\nthe tricky areas of parenting that I\nthink um because it doesn't fall into\nthe extremes yeah I love this question\nthat's a word I don't often hear\nactually what impingement like can you\nact like what like like impinging yeah\nlike impinging on the child's in um\ninherent natural desires or aversion to\nthings got it right like you say hey\nwe're going over so- and so's house and\nthey say you know I don't like their\nkids you go listen you got to learn to\nplay with other kids and go no I don't\nlike their kids you say did something\nhappen and so we're not talking about a\ndangerous situation like no I don't like\nthe I just really want to just stay home\nyeah this is a great that so are we\ngoing to impinge on their I mean because\nwe're teaching them either way we're\nteaching them something you got to do\nstuff you don't want to do even if you\ndon't like it yeah and here again we're\nruling out the possibility that there's\nsomething unsafe about the environment\npsychologically or physically unsafe or\nbut at the same time we're teaching them\num hey you're I see you I hear you but\nyou know your desires might not be right\nthere there's actually a kind of an like\na tacit message of the way you feel\nmight not be the best gauge of what's\nbest for you which sends a complicated\nmessage to a kid totally so this is\nagain where I think at good inside like\nfamily jobs are so useful family jobs to\nme when I used to meet with parents and\nlike they describe a situation I feel\nlike 90% of the time that's where I'd\nstart because then that flows from there\nit's like a framework so what is my job\nI'm the one who sets boundaries like I\nam the one who makes key family\ndecisions obviously as our kids get\nolder they they should be making some\ndecisions too no one likes to feel\ncontrolled but key decisions and my job\nis to validate my kids experience this\nis actually complicated because again\nover and over we think that validating\nmy kids's experience means they're going\nto dictate a decision my boundaries\ndon't dictate my kids feelings and my\nkids feelings should not dictate my\nboundaries they're just two equal things\nso this is a great example my kids\nshould like you know I don't like\nplaying with those kids and I can I just\nstay home with let's just say Grandma\nwas home can I just stay home I'm like I\njust think it's important to go as a\nfamily but my kid doesn't want to go\nthere's nothing dangerous okay to me\nthis is that exact way of putting family\njobs into action sweetie like and to me\nthis phrase I wish every parent could\nsay this to their kid I believe you if\nyou want to make a kid feel real and\nconfident for Life confidence comes from\nthe experience of being believed because\nthat's how you I for me confidence is\nself trust it's not feeling good about\nyourself it's self-trust I really do\nknow the way I feel so let's say I say\nto my son in that situation it's I\nbelieve you I'd start that way I believe\nyou look I I know you want to play\nfootball all day and the kid around your\nage hates football like that would\nprobably be lowest on your list of types\nof kids you'd want to hang out with for\nthe afternoon I totally believe\nyou\nand in this family we know\nthat sometimes we have to do things we\ndon't love to do we do that for a family\nexperience I say this to my kid all the\ntime you know also just to end up being\na good adult you just have to end up\npracticing as a kid doing things you\ndon't want to do things that are boring\nthings that aren't your preference so\nyou know you notch in your belt for that\nso you don't have to thank me and and\nalso I know you have it in you to do\nyour best to be polite and engaged like\nI just I know you're a good kid and this\nisn't what you want and I know we're\ngoing to get through it now if it's\nreally hard maybe young hey let's create\na sign like can you look at me and\ngo when you feel like you're kind of at\nthis and then me and you we're going to\ngo to the bathro I'm going to give you a\nhug and right I'm going to say I know\nthis isn't what you want and when we get\nhome we could watch that football game\nwhatever it was right because what we\noften do is we leave ourselves with two\nchoices with kids we either say fine\nstay home their feelings actually just\ndictated the decision that's not helpful\nfor them I don't want my kid to learn in\nlife when I don't want to do something\npeople twist and turn to make that thing\nnot happen like that's disturbing for\nadulthood expectations but then we do\nthe other thing which is like you are so\nselfish just because don't have a friend\nyour age doesn't mean that you can't\ncome with us so we either let their\nfeelings dictate or we think our\nboundaries kind of give us the right to\nbe mad at our kid right like to do both\nis so important and so that's where I\nthink to me when I hear impingement like\nI actually think that's that is the\nexact space where you have the most bang\nfor your buck as a parent like it's not\nenjoyable and again if I have my\nbeautiful intervention with my son do\nnot think my kid will look at me and say\nI love how you explained that that was\nso beautiful no he's going to roll his\neyes my job is not to take the bait cuz\nI'm an adult and to also hold hope I\nthink that's really important this Con\nconcept of I'm validating my kids\nfeelings where they are today but I need\nto be the one to hold hope that they can\ncope with it if I can't name to my kid I\nknow you're going to get through it\nthey're not going to be able to see that\nkind of next more mature version of\nthemselves and I actually think it's the\nsame as your best boss you know's like I\nknow you don't want to go on this trip I\nI don't whatever it is I know this\npresentation topic isn't the one you\nwould have chosen and there were 10\nthings and this was literally number 10\nI totally get that and it stinks and I'm\nnot taking anything away from that and\nthis is the thing I need you to do and I\nknow something about you like when you\nput your mind to something you always do\na great job and like it's probably not\ngoing to be enjoyable but I do know\nyou're going to do a great job on this\nlike that's like the boss you want\namazing are you adopting children by the\nway I'm I actually I finished college\nand actually I actually consider Andrew\nyou adult children uh what I'm hearing\nis don't dictate their behavior with and\nI'm G to underline and bold dictate\ndon't dictate their behavior you're\ngoing to do this because I said so\nthat's dictatorship but at the same time\ndon't quash the emotion behind the\nresistance kind of acknowledge it make\nthem feel real\num I believe you I I love this phrase\namazing and I love your definition of\nconfidence if people didn't hear that\nwe're definitely going to repeat it\nagain and we're going to we're going to\netch it into your neural circuitry\nbecause I love that it's it's a it's a\nself trust\nyes and this notion of giving hope\nyou're giving them a an incentive that's\nbased on a reward that's actually good\nfor them that they can translate to\nother situations as well uh wow\num can I double click on reward because\nyou know what made me think I didn't\nthink until you said that like I think\nin a situation we'd be tempted to say\nlike and if you go and you're polite\nI'll give you 20 extra minutes of Roblox\nright that's like and first of all let\nme just say something like whatever I\nsay to you like for listeners like it's\nnot like I do this stuff all the time\nwith my actual kids I'm the first one\nsometimes to be like here's your thing I\nhave to dangle we'll provide a little\nsection in the comment section on\nYouTube where your kids can no I'm just\nkidding EXA your kids are forbidden no\noh wait that's wait that's dictating we\nunderstand why you I believe that you\nwould want to comment um but but we're\ngoing to trust uh we're going to let you\nknow why it's a it's good for you if you\ndon't anyway I'll practice this on\nsomeone else's kids but the reward like\nthe when your kid ends up seeing\nthemsel capable of doing something they\ndidn't previously think they could do\nyou know better than me like I feel like\nthat is like one of the best rewards\neven if it's getting through a social\nsituation or I think about this a lot\nwith you know my little kid is I don't\nknow like struggling with a puzzle or\nsomething and I could just do it for\nthem or if I help them kind of regulate\noh this is a hard puzzle and you can\ntake a break I I just know you're going\nto figure it out today I just know it\nand then because of that they get there\nthat feels in your body like that is the\nbest kind of reward and it's the type of\nreward that works for kids in adulthood\nwhen they're in a job we want them to be\nmotiv ated by the feeling they're going\nto have of Pride not be saying hey I\nfinished my thing early do I get a bonus\nto their boss like that's that's not\ngoing to play out as well I love it I um\nI'm just pausing and shaking my head\nonly because I love it so much um and I\njust want to make sure that I don't\nquickly move to the next question\nwithout drilling down even deeper into\nsome of these Concepts um I believe you\nas the\nfeedback uh or response that can instill\nreal confidence over time um not to get\ntoo nuanced here\nbut how is it different because I I\nsense it is different than I hear you I\nhear you but you're going to do this\nanyway yes or I hear you but listen in\nthis\nfamily yeah um I believe you the word\nbelieve is powerful and I believe\nthere's real power in specific words as\nis you know like for instance sturdiness\nagain such a such a powerful and\nunderused word I believe you um what do\nyou you're a psychologist what what do\nyou think we're hearing when somebody\nsays I believe you that's different than\nI hear you I haven't listed these out\nbut I think we all have these like core\nneeds as humans and I think being\nbelieved is one of them because it's\nit's someone else kind of saying like\nyou're real that's what I I might not\nfeel what you're feeling but that thing\nthat feels strong to you that nobody can\nsee or measure is\nreal and when I think\nabout the most confident people like I\nthink about this girl who I went to Duke\nwith and she was just brilliant like so\nsmart we were in this seminar it was one\nof these small classes where this\nprofessor was like talking about stuff\nand like I for once I was like I have no\nidea what this person's talking about\nbut like I was like no one else was\nstopping and this girl raised her hand\nand she said I'm sorry if everyone else\nis annoying like I have no idea what\nyou're talking about like is there any\ncuz I usually do and like is there any\nway you could say that in a different\nway that is like to me the utmost\nversion of confidence that she believed\nher own experience of confusion was real\nconfusion she didn't think it was a sign\nshe was stupid she she believed it she\nbelieved herself that is so confident\nand I think when someone says I hear you\nthere they're they it's like a version\nof listening there's many worse phrases\nno damage is done when we follow\nanything but but we tend to invalidate\nso that's not good anyway I believe you\nbut is also not going to but there's a\nmillion examples of this to me that\nbuild confidence and I actually think\nthere's so many situations with kids\nwhere they say situations and we worry\noh they have low confidence and then we\nintervene to quote make them feel better\nwhich actually is the thing that lowers\ntheir confidence because it's like we\nsay to them I don't believe you you're\nnot really feeling the way you feel\nwhere I believe you is the exact\nopposite so like I like to give an\nexample just cuz it makes it concrete\nlike my kid will come home and say\num I don't know um I was picked last for\nyou know for Dodgeball today I was pick\nlast and something and and they're\nthey're clearly very very sad right and\nwe want to say to them like it's no big\ndeal or everyone's pick last sometimes\nor but remember yesterday you told me\nyou were pick first for basketball and\nwe think like I need to build up my kids\nconfidence those are\nconfidence I say destroying that's\nreducing interventions cuz a kid is kind\nof coming to a parent basically saying\nI'm up very very upset that I was picked\nlast and we're saying to a kid no you\nweren't and they're like but I am and\nwhat they learn is this is really\nterrifying to me is other\npeople are better feelers of my feelings\nthan I\nam and that has like a million really\nscary interpersonal I think relationship\nkind of consequences later down later\ndown in life but when a kid says you\nknow I was pick last and nobody even\nwants me and they all think I'm the\nworst athlete whatever a kids say to sit\nand say some version of like I'm so glad\nwe're talking about this and I could\ntell that was a really hard gym class\nand sweetie\nlike I I believe\nyou you will watch your kid it is crazy\nto me what parents tell me happen when\nthey say those words to their kids\nthey're like it also just like literally\ndiffus us used everything and they were\nlike ready to move on like they are just\ntrying to tell you probably like I was\nfeeling something it was a lot it was\nconfusing right our feelings are always\nhardest when we're alone in them so I\nwas alone in it and I bring it to you\nand someone says I believe you not only\nare they giving you that corn need\nthey're also just like they're like\nsitting down with you in it and that's\nthat makes everything better and then\nmeanwhile what a kid feels like when we\nsay I believe you to a hard experience\nor hard feeling is they're like the\nfeelings that overwhelm me don't\noverwhelm my parents they can tolerate\nit they're not scared of me kind of\nbeing a loser in gym class one day and\nif my parent likes me when I have that\nfeeling like I can start to like myself\nwhen I have that feeling it's so great\nbecause it sounds\nlike it accomplishes both things it\nmakes kids feel real and safe\nyes real and safe and you know I can't\nhelp but at ask say because you know how\nwe started off today was that this isn't\njust about parent child relationships\nbut in friendships in romantic\nrelationships and cooworker\nrelationships that the words I believe\nyou I have to presume based on\neverything I'm hearing now and feeling\ninside about it that it's equally\neffective huge well you know years ago I\nwas on like a podcast early on and to me\nthere are these three lines that kind of\nall go together when kids are anyone's\nupset and it's kind of like you start\nand to me it's like a beautiful\ninvitation to have that conversation\njust to say to someone I'm so glad\nyou're talking to me about this right\nand then kind of I believe you tell me\nmore and my husband that when he heard\nit was like you know you could like say\nthose words to me sometimes like I would\nlike that because and I think about the\nworkplace too like you have someone come\nin they're upset about I don't know I\ngot staffed on this or I'm not getting a\npromotion and I I thought I was like\njust diffuse it with just I'm so glad\nyou're talking to me about this yeah\nI've been working nonstop for and just\nif you say to them like I I I believe\nyou cuz we usually don't say to someone\nI don't believe you but what we'll say\nis we we defend ourselves in that moment\nand the way the other person receives it\nis as if we're saying I don't believe\nthe intensity of the experience you're\nhaving and when you do lead with I\nbelieve you same thing in a partnership\nyou know like every time I ask you to do\nsomething you get really hot and\nbothered like it doesn't even mean you\nagree you're kind of just believing I\nlike I like I believe you like tell me\nmore right I believe you that that\nreally upset you and like I'm obviously\nI have a whole another story in my head\nbut like I hear what you're saying and\nand I know there's something there and I\nbelieve it enough to like be open to\nhearing more about it I don't know\nthat's like what's best that's what\nthat's what we all want in our in our\nPartnerships I mean I'm wide-eyed I mean\nwhat a beautiful acknowledgement that as\nyou pointed out is not agreeing to\naccept someone else's reality to the\nextent that you're going to dismantle\nuntil the the you know the order of the\nworld whatever it is but it's such an\nopening as opposed to a closing and as\nyou said it's non-fed but it's also\nboundaried I mean there's just so many\nthings about it that feel good um seem\ngood and and clearly are good you know I\ndon't want to go down the the um tragic\nRabbit Hole of trauma but um previous\nguest on this podcast um you know is\ndefined we should probably trauma just\nbecause it gets thrown around a lot\ntrauma an event or set of\ncircumstances um that fundamentally\nchange the way that the brain and\nnervous system work so that there's a\nmaladaptive response going forward it's\nnot every bad thing that happens but\nthere are microt traumas sometimes\ncalled small tea more macr traumas big\ntea again could be multi-event or single\nevent but years ago a different\npsychologist psychiatrist who's an\nadolescent um psychiatrist at Stanford\nsaid something uh in a seminar that just\nreally struck me which was that at at\nits core trauma is really about\nconfusion over who's\nresponsible um and and here we're not\njust talking about the the more Salient\nexamples of like sexual assault that\nthose two U of course but you know like\nif if we get screamed at um or we\nobserve something like third person\ntrauma like the The Logical stance is\nwell okay that was them not me but when\nthis happens especially when young the\nnervous system the brain some somehow\ninterprets this as like I was there I\nhad a role in it just by being there so\nlike what was my role and somehow the\nemotional response becomes one of\nresponsibility even if we know like\nthey're clearly the one that initiated\nthis and so um the reason I'm bringing\nthis up in this context is that it's\nalmost like that lack of belief in self\nsomehow gets rooted in and then it all\nfeels confusing and then we don't feel\nsafe that's right because it's a\nconfusion about responsibility again\ngoing back to this um we go down that\nrabbit hole for a second please please\nthat's why I raised it I think that your\nthought I always think trauma is\nactually not events it's the way an\nevent gets processed and I I love Gabor\nM's definition of trauma it's not what\nhappens to you it's what happens inside\nof you right so to me there's an\ninherent relationality there where\nevents that get proc not any event\nevents with high emotionality let's say\nthat get processed in aloneness\nbecome traumatic and I think that's\nwhere it gets linked to responsibility\nso this is actually what my TED Talk was\nabout and why repair is so\nimportant um who said this Ronald\nFairburn years ago that for kids it is\nbetter to be a sinner in a world ruled\nby God than to live in a world ruled by\nthe devil I think it explains almost\neverything about Child Development right\nthere going back to goodness\nalso your parent just screamed at you\nand by the way your parent I scream at\nmy kids everyone's going to scream at\ntheir kids it's going to happen Okay\nthat's just the event the event's not\ngoing to have the impact what is\nhappening for a kid well we know kids\nare oriented by attachment they\nliterally need us to survive like they\ncould not survive on their own and so\nwhat do you do when the person you're\ndependent on for safety becomes the\nsource of danger and threat that's very\nconfusing for a child in that moment so\nthey're super hyperaroused they're in\nthe state of you know Terror and then\nusually after in my house too I just\nyell at my kid they're kind of alone in\ntheir room I'm alone in the kitchen or\nwherever meanwhile spinning cuz like I'm\nsuch a bad parent like I'm Pro you know\nbut meanwhile because I'm so lost in my\nown guilt I might not be going to my kid\nand so what happens for my kid if I\ndon't repair after I scream at them or\none of these events right well a kid\ncannot say to themselves my parent just\nhad a bad day then the Badness is in my\nparent my leader I'm I'm young now right\nlike I don't understand Nuance my leader\ncan't be bad so I must take on the\nBadness at least then I have control so\nkids after they're kind of yelled at in\nthe absence of repair they they really\nonly have two options for how to\nregulate and feel safe again they can\nself-blame it's all my fault which is\nwhy I feel like most adults when they\nhave a hard time they tell themselves\nlike it's my fault I'm not good enough\nit's like the legacy of that story from\nchildhood or they use\nself-doubt maybe that didn't happen\nhappen maybe I overreacted maybe I can't\ntrust myself again it leads to adults\nwho basically say like did I overreact\nor let me call five friends let me see\nif they think what my boyfriend did was\na big deal cuz they can't trust\nthemselves and so trauma trauma what I\nwant every parent to know is they'll say\nI left my kid alone and I didn't pick\nthem up at the soccer field is that\ngoing to traumatize them and I'll say\nwell that's just the event like did you\nsay to them hey that probably felt scary\nwhat was that like H you're right like\nyou were alone now all of a sudden next\nto the event that was\nscary is my story and my connection it\ngot processed in a safe connection it\ndidn't get processed in aloneness and\nthat's that's a massive massive\ndifference in the scenario you are\ndescribing the parent who yelled goes to\nthe\nchild uh having been that child um and\nperhaps also having been that parent um\nhow do we deal with the fact that\nsometimes you know we don't want to be\naround the person that yelled at us\nit hurt it hurts to receive the care or\nthere's there's a there's a like a\ntextured landscape as opposed to a\nsmooth landscape there like like okay\nnow you're ready for everything to be\npeaceful I'm still with my feelings I\nguess that's where the I believe you\ncomes in and that's where the Sorting it\nthrough process begins is that well I\nthink it's like what version of a parent\ncomes back to me the the first thing we\nhave to do in a repair process is\nactually repair with ourselves as a\nparent\nreally because if you haven't repaired\nwith yourself which to me is kind of\nseparating your identity again from your\nbehavior like okay Becky I'll use myself\nan example I'm a good parent who just\nscreamed at her son like I did not mess\nup forever and you see when you try to\nrepair with yourself those two things\nget collapsed I'm like I messed them up\nforever I'm a monster wait like I'm a\ngood parent who did something I'm not\nproud of you can't repair with someone\nuntil you've repaired with yourself they\nfeel it from you they actually it\nusually is like then you're asking for\nthem I'll be like it's okay right like\nyou forgive me right that's not a repair\nthat's like using your child to try to\ndo something we just have to do on our\nown or with other adults but if I've\nrepaired with myself I'm going to show\nup in a different way might I have a\nfeisty kid I might like I don't care\nit's not better that's okay I'm not\nrepairing to get something from my child\nI'm repairing to give an experience to\nthem so we can also get creative you\nknow your kid is older you text them you\nslip a door under the note you say okay\nI just have to say this one thing thing\nto me this line really matters to like\nsnatch that self- blame out of a kid's\nbody is just like I'm sorry I yelled it\nis it's never your fault when I\nyell and it's not and people who argue\nlike our ability to regulate our\nemotions predated our child's existence\nlike that you know like they had a they\nhad something they did something and we\nfelt frustrated but that's very\ndifferent than yelling right and saying\nthat to your kid is so important\nmeanwhile the next day you might say by\nthe way let's really figure out how to\nget out the door in a smoother way you\nknow you could work on whatever they\nneed to work on but the reason I think\nmost kids end up rejecting parents\napologies is it's not really repair\nwe're asking our kid for permission to\nbe okay again or a repair sounds like\nhey I'm sorry I yelled but you know like\nif you just got ready in time that\nwouldn't have happened or we say I'm\nsorry you felt that way I'm sorry you\nfelt that way those are not like none of\nthose are actually repairs and if that's\nwhat a kid's been used to they're going\nto keep a parent more at Bay so is it\nsafe to say that we can always come back\nto making the kid feel real and safe I\nbelieve you was a great place to start\nand the reason I keep coming back to\nthese these simple things is that simple\nbut very very potent by the way um is\nthat in the real world landscape of\nparenting family in life things are\nhappening really fast and it's very\nDynamic and it's multifaceted I mean we\nhaven't even talked yet about how when\nthere's two parents like the one that\ndidn't yell um when there's multiple\nsiblings when I mean there's you know\nhuman dynamics on a one in in other\nother landscape is is hard enough and\nthen when you start introducing the real\nworld landscape um things happen fast so\nhaving something that people can reach\nto really quickly what I call in the\nlandscape of stress modulation which is\nsomething that I'm more familiar with\nfrom my labs work is you know real time\ntools yep real time tools like we're all\nat our best after meditation vacation\nmassage and a good night sleep but what\nabout real time tools when everything's\neverything's hectic um so what does a\nreally good apology look\nlike in the real world yeah um because a\nreally good apology in the ideal world\nof uh\nInstagram um is yeah I believe you I'm\nso sorry with no butts no this that but\na real apology sometimes is as you're\nboarding a plane or when there's a bunch\nof other things that are going on and\nyou haven't even dealt with those yet or\nwhen you're on your way to an event or\nyeah okay so you get it uh what does a\nreally good internal landscape for\napology look like like how can we touch\ninto where we need to be and then what\nare the words that even if we have to\ntry again later and again and again\nlater with that person in this case kid\nbut person more generally um what's the\nlike go-to solid apology so yeah I think\nyou are never going to go wrong saying I\nbelieve you to your kid like obviously\nnot you say it randomly but if they're\nreally upset you yelled at me I believe\nyou like if that's all you can remember\nyou're crushing it I think a realistic\nrepair you have to do something for\nyourself and like to me it can be a very\nsimple Mantra like to me I'm a good\nparent who is having a hard time is the\none I use honestly over and over just\nand after I yell at my kids before I'll\nlike go to the bathroom sometimes and\nI'll say that to myself Becky like I'm a\ngood parent having a hard time and I'll\nkind of say it as many times as I need\nuntil I really do feel something like\nshift a little in my body it just\nbecause again I think that phrase\nseparates what I did from who I am right\nand then to me a realistic apology it\ncould be super simple if you remember\nnothing else could just be like I'm\nsorry I yelled that's that's great if\nyou want to if you're like I'm feeling\nit Becky give me that next step I'm you\nknow I'm sorry I\nyelled just like you I'm working on\nmanaging my emotions and you know next\ntime even when I'm frustrated I'm going\nto try to stay calm something about the\nnext time you know if you want to throw\nin that it's not your fault kids it\nseems an odd thing because parents are\nlike why do kids assume it's their fault\nit is their default position and so it's\nnever a bad thing to throw in but\nhonestly just simply hey I'm sorry I\nyelled that actually gives them that\nrealness because without saying anything\nmore you're saying that thing you think\nhappened did happen so that's powerful\nI'd like to take a quick break and thank\nour sponsor insid tracker insid tracker\nis a personalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and\nDNA to help you better understand your\nbody and help you reach your

huberman how do you suggest\nparents deal with um retorts and\nrudeness and again let's um extend this\nto all relationships so you get in your\nbest\nmindset and by the way I love this I am\nthing um two of the most important\nimportant words in any language um when\ntranslated to other languages I am blank\nI am a good this or I am whatever role\nidentity is key to the brain um we know\nthis\num you go in and you say I'm really\nsorry I struggle to regulate my emotions\nyeah I believe that you're really upset\nyeah and the kid says I hate you mhm now\nearlier you said that good boundaries\nare about not expecting a change in\nbehavior from someone else they're about\nour own boundaries so um where maybe the\nI hate you comes from you know listen\nwe're not going to go to so- and so's\nhouse for a play date today great\nexample I hate you yeah I hate you um so\nis there ever a case for no response I\nmean to me the most underutilized\nparenting strategy is doing nothing\nliterally it's one of my most used\nstrategies IES cuz and there's there's\nthere's like really good reason for it\nespecially in this situation so I always\nto me like I always say we have to\nunderstand before we intervene so I know\nevery parent like what do you do in that\nsituation but it's like trying like it's\nlike trying to fix someone's tennis\nswing before you like look at their\ntennis swing right like what there could\nbe a lot of problems so again why is a\nkid saying I hate you and I would ask\nevery parent to just keep this in mind\nit's a tool and you can't use it in real\ntime eventually you can but we have to\nsay it at like the end of a night when\nmy kids said I hate you what is my most\ngenerous\ninterpretation of why he would say that\nto me and if you're like any human me\nincluded by the way like your least\ngenerous interpretation is immediate\nyou're like because he's a sociopath\nlike that's what we say all the time\nwe're like wow or because he's like a\nhorrible kid because he's spoiled\nbecause he's nasty it comes easily so\nthat's fine but what is my most generous\ninterpretation and when I don't know\nI'll push myself to say okay well like I\nwas in a situation with my husband\nwhat would lead me to say that I what\nwould lead you to say that to someone\nthat I hate them yeah like they like say\nsomething to you like hey Andrew we're\nnot going to be able to you know do this\ndinner it would have to be some sort of\ndeep betrayal of trust and and when I'm\nand I have to acknowledge that if I said\nthat to somebody that I really care\nabout or love if as I'm saying I hate\nyou what I'm really saying is I love you\nso much and that hurts\nunbelievably at such an unbelievable\nintensity that what's coming out of my\nmouth is I hate you because if you\nbecause if you didn't love them that's\nright it would have null effect it would\nbe a me it would be it would be a it\nwould be a met but instead it's a oh it\nhurts so we somehow there's a neural\ncircuit in there that goes you know I\nwhatever insert explicative hate you\nthat's right but what you're really\nsaying is I love you so much yeah and as\na consequence that thing you did or said\nhurts so much that's right and so I\nthink that's like exactly what's going\non for a\nkid or like to me my most generous\ninterpretation in a simple way is my kid\nwhen I said we couldn't go to this\nfriend's house that he thought we were\ngoing to his friend he was going to\nsleep\nover he had like so built it up in his\nmind he'd like probably like kids do\nlike they have this whole image oh and\nthen we're going to do this and this and\nlike the let down was so intense and\nagain I go back to kids have all the\nfeelings we have and they're born with\nnone of the skills so it takes a lot of\nit takes like a pretty well-developed\nskill to be really disappointed by the\nway and surprised right in the moment\nand like manage it in like a mature way\nI I'm sure we both know adults who\naren't really capable of doing that\nright so the fact that my seven-year-old\nis doing that so if I think about it\nthat way we latch on to our kids words\nas if they're the truth they're not the\ntruth it's not to say they don't matter\nbut they're not the truth the truth is\nwhatever world is under the words like\nI'm disappointed appointed and I don't\nknow how to manage that so if I think\nabout the outcome like what would where\ndo I want to be what I would love in\nthat situation cuz the truth is when I\nsay to my kid sorry we can't go to\nBobby's house I wouldn't even want it's\nnot normal for my kid to be like oh no\nproblem because like I would I'm just\npicturing my 25-year-old like trying to\nget a job and being like Mom oh I didn't\nget it and then he's like no problem I'm\nlike that's kind of weird like really\nlike that's weird like I'd want you to\nbe disappointed and so what I want my\nkid to be able to do is to be like I\ndon't know what the best it gets like oh\nman I was really looking forward to that\nthat's like ultimate maturity so how do\nI get from I hate you to oh man I was\nreally like you know looking forward to\nthat the all the things we want to do\njust like don't even make sense like\nsending my kid to their room saying like\nyou're such a nasty kid I've never seen\nany of your friends say that to their\nparents and I'm good at acting these\nthings out because of course I say these\nthings too but all I'm doing is\nbasically telling my kid the version of\nthemselves I don't want them to be so\nnow I'm further away from that outcome\njust not\neffective my kid obviously literally\nneeds to learn some of those skills and\npractice them we don't think about\nsimulations with kids nearly enough we\nknow that in sports people practice all\nthe time we don't do that with emotion\nregulation so what do I do in the moment\nI think the best question here is what\ndo I do outside the moment to help my\nkid build the skills so they actually\nhave more of a skill than next time that\nmoment comes still I'm a pragmatist what\ndo I do in the moment I hate you I\nprobably would do nothing first when\nsomeone is rude to you and they say\nsomething nasty I don't know I just like\nthis is one this is my son this is me my\nson just hurled I hate you it's like\nsitting between us when we say back to\nthem like you know I hate you or like go\nto your room we take all the energy from\nwhat they said and we just like throw it\nand then like we have this ping-pong\nmatch when you do nothing I always\npicture if this is like that hate you it\njust sits between us my kid has a much\nhigher chance of kind of reing\nwhat they just said because I'm just\nkind of sturdy in that moment because I\ndidn't just take it from them and say\nsomething to them which just gives them\nthe opportunity to like take what I said\nand have no responsibility for the first\nthing they said it's always true in\nadults when someone says to you like\nsomething nasty if you actually just\nstay there they're kind of like oh shoot\nlike I shouldn't have said that because\nlike it's it's right there so I'd\nprobably say nothing no a couple I don't\nknow if I'd really do that but I'd want\nto do that let me be clear something\nelse you can say in that moment which\ntakes a lot of presence so it's not\ngoing to happen right away is just\nsomething like whoo like clearly you're\ndisappointed I get that I believe you\nand I know there's another way you can\nsay that to me that's actually right\nback to family jobs I'm validating and\nI'm setting kind of a boundary in some\nways like I know maybe there's little\nhope there too like I know there's\nanother way if my kid keeps saying I\nhate you I hate you you're the worst\nyou're the worst I'm GNA say listen I\nlove you you're a good kid you're having\na hard\ntime I I really won't stay in your room\nwhile you keep saying this to me and\npart of that is because it's not good\nfor you either like this isn't a good\nDynamic I'm going to step outside I'm\ngoing to come back and we can talk about\nit when we're both in a place where we\ncan be a little more respectful or\nsomething like that right you don't have\nto be a punching bag but at least now\nI'm helping my kid see that he is having\na feeling under these words if I can't\ndifferentiate the feeling from the\nbehavior how can I expect my kid to ever\nlearn to differentiate those two which\nis how my kid can actually get to a more\nregulated place I've sometimes wondered\nwhether or not parents are either afraid\nof\nor Not Afraid enough of their\nkids um I've known some parents that are\nafraid of their kids because and perhaps\nas a consequence who knows what the\nchicken egg uh is there all we know is\nthe parent was alive first\nthe kids learn to control their parents\nthrough not necessarily emotional\noutbursts but the threat of emotional\noutbursts I've seen this again and again\nand it's it's a pretty wild thing to\nobserve um and of course as an observer\nit's far easier than when you're in it\nbut this idea like who like they're like\na pot ready to Bo boil over uh um you\nknow like they're going to pop um and\nI've seen this in teach in the classroom\nI've seen this in so many venues where\nwhether or not the child understands\nthat they're somehow controlling the\nsituation or not that there's just an\ninherent fear of what could happen and\nthen I think kids feel a certain power\nbut they don't feel safe right I mean\nhow could they right their children yes\num so for the parents out there that are\nafraid of their kids' potential\nresponses and or how bad their kid quote\nunquote might turn out if they were to\nreally lay down the law here I'm using\nkind of old school language but I listen\nI grew up you know 48 years old so you\nknow I yeah I mean my parents you know\ndidn't physically abuse us but there\nmight have been a spanking and every\nonce in a while or I I don't know what\nthe rule is nowadays or the or the the\nuh standard out there you know I think I\nwon't say which why I might have taken a\nsmack here there but not many um and it\nthere was also a lot of love um but\nclearly um and here I'm not I'm not\nsupporting the use of corporal\npunishment I want to be very clear um\nbut you know yeah kids can be tough and\nthen also you know it wasn't long into\nmy high school years when I was\nphysically larger than both my parents I\nnever used that to intimidate them but I\nhave to imagine when your kid is larger\nthan you if you were already\npsychologically afraid of them now you\nit's clear to both of you that the uh\nthe tables have turned that's right\nright I'm talking about the the\nunconscious semiconscious aspects of\nthis I'm not talking about who can you\nknow obviously physical fights there's\nnot something I ever want to see or\nparticipate in in a household so this\nthis is an amazing topic like walking on\neggshells this is right and this is\nterrifying to a kid because again if a\nkid is trying to figure out like am I\nreal and am I Safe Kids do experience\nfeelings in such an intense way because\nthey don't have any of those skills and\nthey're so surprising and they're so\nvisceral that it is scary to them and\nthere are kind of especially these\ngroups of kids I call them deeply\nfeeling kids that do feel things more\nintensely and they do have more of these\nbig massive Tantrums they even look\nanimalistic often during they try to\nscratch you they'll hiss during them\nthey'll growel yes really yes there was\na I grew up with some biters yeah kids\nthat bite yes that's because again those\nare just feelings literally uncontained\nthat are exploding out and where do they\nexplode out through your extremities so\nthey that's really what it is and so\nwhat will happen and this is this really\nunfortunate dance and one of the my\nfavorite things to help people turn\naround is then kids kind of sense from a\nparent like I really am as toxic as I\nworried I was right and again if we go\nback to that pilot thing like I think\nabout a pilot who's like um we have to\nmake an emergency landing we're not\ngoing to be able to go to La and we're\nall going to land in Cleveland whatever\nit is I picture of the passenger who's\nlike you are going to take us to LA and\nthe Pilot's like okay okay like can you\nimagine you're like it doesn't matter\nthat this person is pissed like you're\nthe pilot you don't have to keep us\nhappy please keep us safe and if you're\non that plane and you're terrified\nbecause you're like we have to make an\nemergency landing I promise you you're\nway more terrified when you hear this\nperson change the decision because of\nthe threat that a passenger is going to\nbe very very upset and that is actually\nwhat we do when we're walking around on\neggshells now the alternative to this\nagain we live in this world in parenting\nwhere there's a binary where we say and\nyou said it yourself so I'm going to lay\ndown the law like I don't recommend that\neither like especially with a kid like\nthat that's not going to be the best\nsolution these kids have to be seen as\ngood kids they are good kids and when I\nwe meet with parents of these kids I\nhear about them and like I always say I\nhear about them and I have a kid like\nthis so I get it and I'm just like I\nreally like your kid and they're like\nwhat I was like I do and they're like\nand then they usually start crying and\nthey go you're literally the first\nperson in 11\nyears who's ever said\nthat including like the parents like you\nlike our kid why I'm like they're\ntenacious they're they know what they\nwant they seem like they have 0% people\npleasing in them these kids will change\nthe world but not if they're\nboundaryless then they'll become tyrants\nand that's that's really terrifying and\nI'm going to teach you how to be the\nsturdy leader which is equally firm as\nit is\nwarm and that's going to start today and\nso like here's an example of these\ndeeply feeling kids I think you said\nsomething about like watching like a TV\nshow where these kids it feels like they\nhold the family emotionally hostage\nright and because if you don't pick the\nFamily the movie that they want to watch\non family movie night they will scream\nthey will cry and they will do that for\n3 hours they will other kids after\nyou're like they're they don't Peter out\nthese kids these kids interestingly\nenough get in an awful cycle with their\nparents because they have such intense\nemotions more often which more\nescalations which tend to get met with\ninvalidation your so dramatic you ruin\neverything they are that much more\ndesperate to be believed they escalate\nfurther you can understand how that\nwould lead to more distance and\ninvalidation and We're Off to the Races\nin a bad Direction and I would say the\nyou're going to during family movie\nnight tomorrow night this is what you're\ngoing to do and you're going to by the\nway I would say this is how concrete I\nget you're going to write this down and\nyou're going to say it to a voice\nrecorder with your own voice and I want\nyou to play it back and see how sturdy\nyou sound and they'll often do it and\nthey'll be like wow I didn't even\nbelieve myself when I said that I'm so\nscared of my child right you're going to\ndo it again and then you're going to do\nit again and this is this is just like\nany other skill we practice and you're\ngoing to say to your kid look I know in\nthis family you know Bobby usually we\nlet him pick the movie he gets really\nupset if not we all tonight's going to\nbe different Bobby\nit is your sister's turn to pick the\nmovie and I know you're going to be\nupset and I just want to tell you\nexactly what's going to happen and I'm\ngoing to in this example I'm saying\nthere's a two Family household which is\nan assumption but even if there's\none say if you're super upset and\nscreaming I'm going to bring you to your\nroom this is important I'm going to sit\nwith you and I'm going to stay there and\nthis is a line that I know from our\ndeeply feeling kid Workshop has really\nand you have to believe it to say it I\nam not scared of your feelings and I\nknow parents will say to me but Dr Becky\nI I am scared of their feelings like\nyeah you're going to fake it till you\nmake it they they need to hear that\nbecause if you think about the image of\nthese kids their feelings feel so\noverpowering to them they feel more but\nthey're actually more porous to the\nworld so they both have more coming in\nand they are actually always terrified\nof how much of them can flow out and so\nthey feel their feelings that way it's\nalmost like my tantrum in the house\ntakes up the entire living room that's\nwhy you actually have to bring them to a\nsmaller room and you actually have to\ncontain them in that way as a way of\nkind of saying like it only goes this\nfar like literally I will not let you\ndictate family movie and always sitting\nin the front SE and your favorite chair\nat dinner like it only goes this far and\nthat is truly an act of love and\nprotection and safety for those\nkids how how often do You observe that\nthese deep deeply feeling kids is that\nhow they refer to um I mean I made up\nthe term so but yeah deeply feeling kids\nyou're you are qualified to to qualify\ntoo so deeply feeling kids um also\nExpress these uh deep feelings in the\npositive sense um I mean because I can\nthink of some kids I grew up with and I\ncan look at my own experience of um like\nit's hard to know we don't have a\ncalibration point it's not like body\ntemperature of like how much I feel\nversus how much you feel we look at the\nexternal expression of these things like\ndid the did the lacrimal gland secrete\nsome tears or not like you know as you\nwere talking about this this thing\nbefore I noticed I like welled up a\nlittle bit and I'm thinking yeah like I\ncan remember seeing things and feeling\nthings and like whoa it's a really big\ninside I don't remember screaming at my\nparents telling them I hate them I\nprobably did at some point but\num but I have observed other other kids\npeers that grew up that clearly fell\ninto this category and have gone on to\ndo remarkable things yes remarkable like\nextraordinary things because it's it's a\ncapacity it that doesn't always skew\ntowards negative expression it can also\nlike immense expressions of love and and\nyou know I think these days that there's\na tendency to for unqualified or like\ntruly unqualified people um because\nthey're not trained to do so to slap\nlabels like borderline right splitting\nlike good object bad object splitting\nand indeed that's that exists in the in\nas a diagnosis and and symptoms of\nborderline but that um we punish rather\nthan um believe and observe that these\nthings exist there's range in nervous\nsystem tuning and affect and um so put\nsimply um do deeply feeling kids also\ntend to express love and joy and um and\npositive emotions with the with the same\nintensity or near same intensity I would\nsay it depends on some\nlike it depends on kind of kind of their\nstage development and the nature of the\ninteractions they've kind of received\nback I think deeply feeling kids I\nalways say are super sensors like if you\nhave won these kids and I have won these\nkids we live in New York City she will\nnot go into a New York City Garage okay\nlike where we park our car and she's\nlike the smell and I'm the rest of us\nare like what are you talking about\nmeanwhile I have another friend who\nlives in a totally different area of\nManhattan and she's a deeply feeling kid\nshe's when she's like my daughter the\nsame thing like I actually believe that\nmy daughter smells something that I\ndon't smell like they are super sensors\nin that way right and she notices the\nlittle detail of something now in terms\nof the intense love I think for these\nkids their vulnerability sits so close\nto their shame this is why they get so\nexplosive they almost experience their\nfeelings as attackers which is again why\nparents can get scared of them and they\ndo because again they feel that feeling\nso intensely that they have this deep\nfear of Abandonment of being too much\nand so they that shame tries to shut it\ndown although it obviously doesn't work\nand it explodes what I've noticed with\ndeeply feeling kids and this to me is\nactually like truly my proudest body of\nwork and you mentioned border line so we\ngo there people have said like these\nsound almost like kids who are like have\nsome\npredilection to to borderline and\nobviously having gone to a PhD program\nwe're told a lot about invalidating\nenvironments and things like that I'm\nnot really one for labels either but I\njust got so much Insight from my\nhonestly my own kid where I was like wow\nlike she is so different and how she\nprocesses things and what she needs and\nhow she responds to my very same\ninteractions as my other kids like\nthey're very different and that fear of\nAbandonment and being too much it was\nlike it was like there from the start it\nreally feels like it was like there\nwhat's so interesting is I feel like\nthrough working with her by the way in a\nvery different way because these kids\nreject almost every typical parenting\nstrategy you go to validate these kids'\nfeelings it's like you're trying to\nintrude on them and steal their heart\nbecause if you think about their\nporousness there so terrified of being\ntaken over that when you're like seeing\na feeling they feel like you're like\nseeing into them and so they reject you\nI always say you can't go in the front\ndoor with these kids you've got to like\nfind these side door approaches but now\nof all my kids she is by far the\ncuddliest the most loving the most\nemphatic about our relationship up this\ntrip now I'm going to miss you so much\nlike the idea when she was four that any\nof that I would say to someone like you\nare crazy you were talking about\ndifferent kid so I think that yes that\ndeep love is there and it we just have\nto kind of make it a little safer for\nthose kids to access\nit is there any kind of General\nstatements that one can still make\naccurately about differences in the\nexpression or perhaps even the\nexperience of deeply feeling kids in\nboys versus\ngirls great\nquestion\num\nI actually haven't noticed a ton there\nmight be I'd love to look more into that\nbut in terms of I want to be accurate I\nhaven't noticed that yet I think one of\nthe things you know you have one of\nthese\nkids is if you know the moments when\nyou're a parent where your kid like\nneeds you like there and in those\nmoments your kids push you away they\npush you away when they need you the\nmost that's like I think a really common\nquality for the for those kids and how\nhow um common is this um I sound like\nsuch a like a a biologist this deeply\nfeeling kid phenotype I I don't I don't\nI don't want to you know I don't want to\num lessen the the importance of of of\nwhat you're saying by saying it that way\nbecause actually what I think you're\nsaying is incredibly important resonates\nwith me on a lot of different levels in\nfact so um but as far as I know it's not\na DSM diagnosis and thank goodness it's\nnot because that would path\nright um so but you know of the you know\nin in a classroom full let's make it a\nbig classroom 100 Kids yeah um how many\nof those kids Pro and I'm guessing it's\na Continuum but would fall into this\ncategory of of deeply feeling I think\nyou're right it's a Continuum and\nconnecting topics I know you've spoken\nabout I've been doing a lot of looking\ninto this overlap with deeply feeling\nkids and neurod Divergence and ADHD\nand what I think is interesting about\nthat is we we have these workshops these\ndeeply feeling kid workshops and a lot\nof them we do live and there's this\nwhole\nchat right and I'll say these things\npeople like that you know they're\ndefinitely ideas they haven't heard but\nwhat I think is more healing is\nthousands of people in the chat and\nsaying I I thought when I say the\nhissing thing the chat is like a\nwaterfall I thought I was the only one I\nthought so like there are so many of\nthese kids why I think there's more and\nmore something I need to look more into\nbut I think it does really if you think\nabout these kids as more porous and you\nthink about how insanely stimulating the\nworld is that we bring up kids what\ncomes into them it would make sense that\nI think this is like a growing type I'm\nguessing it's similar with ADHD too I\nare so many more kids diagnosed than in\nthe past the world we bring up kids in\nthe sensory overload if you're kind of\nthat much more porous that's going to\noverload your\nsystem and you know it see and I think\nthat I think that's also why more and\nmore kids are so what's the percentage I\ndon't I don't know like uh maybe 20 but\nthat that's a fairly high percentage I\ndo I think it's a fairly high percentage\nbut that feels right it just sort of\nfeels right based on my observation of\nadults also yeah um feels right might\nalso explain a lot of the um apparent\nconflicts and and um Miser\nunderstandings and adult relationships\nthat's ex and we I mean so many people\nlike they'll say me I was oh my goodness\nlike that was like that was like years\nof therapy for me watching that I\nthought I would took that from my kid\nlike this was me and I finally talking\nabout I believe you that's what I mean\ndeeply feeling kids are desperate to be\nbelieved and they're desperate for our\nattempts to connect with them because\ntheir deep fear is their unlovability\nand so they do reject typical you know\nit's a Dan get out of my room fine\nyou're so difficult and then see I\nreally am as unlovable and bad as I\nworried I was right unless we kind of\nreverse that cycle I'd be willing to bet\nmy life that most of the ultra\nsuccessful performing artists that we\nobserve um I'm not going to name names\nbut just think of ultra successful that\nthe people whose words music poetry\nwriting acting uh presence evokes\nimmense uh emotion in other people so\nmuch that people will pay money to see\nthese people Express their emotions and\nwhat's inside them fall into this deeply\nfeeling category 100% I mean it just\ncan't be any other way right yeah the\nthe muted uh performer unless that's the\nthe shtick so to speak is um is just not\ncompelling yeah yeah and um a lot of\nwhat we're talking today is about um the\nkind of um tuning fork nature of\nemotions uh it's a wow what what a\ntricky balance speaking of that I'd like\nto just return to something I raised\nearlier and then I made the mistake it\nwas my fault of shutting the hatch on it\nI'd like to reopen that hatch which is\num when there's two parents maybe\nthey're under the same roof maybe\nthey're not uh or let's just say two\ncaretakers um\nso kids are pretty darn good at figuring\nout who to go to For What and how to\nbalance out negative experiences by\nseeking out the positive reinforcement\nof the other sometimes even pitting\nparents and caretakers against one\nanother I mean makes children sound\ndiabolical but adults do it too it's\ncalled\ngossip\nwhat can co-parents co-\ncaretakers um do to try and align\nstrategies or if necessary to offset um\nsome like bad stuff that the other\nparent might be doing and in today's\nlandscape where it's about 50% of of\nmarriages end in divorce at least in the\nUS you also have the the situation where\nthen they um new significant others come\nin and now you've extended the landscape\nto you know sometimes five or six\ndifferent parents you know yeah my\nfamily's my biological family is\nstarting to look like the UN we've got\nso many countries and religions and this\nthing it's kind of nice on the one hand\nbut um lots of Divergence of opinion and\nemotional stance and background so how\nin the world do we do we wrap our\nefforts around this yeah so I one of the\nmost common questions I get from a\nparent at good inside is like can you\nconvince my partner why the way they do\nthings is wrong and you know do things\nmore like good inside and so essentially\nI always say like yeah I'm not for a\nmillion Reasons I'm not like too\ninterested in taking that phone call um\nyou know but yeah I don't get involved\nin couple disput um you know but but\nagain assuming and you've said this a\ncouple times which I love like I'm\nassuming the way you're kind of partner\nor you know the co-parent does things is\nnot like really like damaging your child\nobviously that's like really time for an\nintervention no hitting no emotional\nabuse exactly but you know even like I'm\nnot a believer of saying for a timeout\nright like I don't believe in timeouts\nand Punishment I I don't think they feel\ngood to kids or parents and I also don't\nthink they're effective no so time out's\nnot effective I don't think so okay and\nI and we probably should have closed the\nhatch on I have to imagine that the\ngoing uh word in the profession of\npsychology and raising kids properly is\nyou never spank them you never hit them\nyeah no okay all right for the record so\nmaybe we'll get back there but just to\ngo on the record and I think you can\nsense from my style not punishing or\ntimeouts like doesn't mean you're per\npermissive at all there's 0% permissive\nor even softness I think you know well\nthere's softness there's 0% permissive\nin those moments but we can get back\nthere but let's say your partner does do\nthat or the co-parent right like I would\nbe the first to say to someone like do I\nthink that that's like messing up your\nkid I I don't I really don't especially\nif for example in that situation let's\nsay um I'm divorced and my now ex you\nknow I just know that they do timeouts\nor and I've tried to talk to them but\nyou know whatever they're not getting on\nboard with the style and to me what\nhappens is like you have a kid they come\nback to you and they're like you know um\npapa gave me a timeout and we don't do\nthat in my house and my first thing is I\ncall my ex that's usually what I do or\nthe school did this and I called the\nschool I called the ex and I'm like why\ndid you do that we don't do that what I\nthink is really important and I actually\nfind it very like relieving to as a\nparent be like what's actually most\nimportant is helping my kid understand\ntheir experience like we Center the\nother person and what they're doing\nwrong wrong instead of centering our kid\nwe might need to call a parent the other\nparent and say like hey it would be\nreally great to get on the same page\ncould we could we do this course\ntogether that would just be great you\ndon't have to agree with anything I I\nthink that would be great but in that\nmoment what my kid needs actually is\nmore like wait that's kind of hard\nconfusing so like in our house when you\ndo something like you scream I hate you\nyou know I intervene in one way and when\nyou go to your dad's house he intervenes\nin a very different way it's a lot of\nlike that's a lot of switching to make\nsense of you know or maybe my kid says\num mom never apologizes to me after she\nyells and I would call you know or maybe\nit's my own wife and I'm like hey you\nknow the importance of repair haven't\nyou listened to all this literature you\nknow I would like to have some influence\non that but what I feel like my kid\nneeds in the moment is more like tell me\nwhat happened oh oh oh she yelled at you\nand yeah look something I know like I\nknow Mom was I know she had a really\nstressful day at work and look this\nisn't your responsibility but you can\njust know this mom has a really hard\ntime apologizing to her has a really\nhard time apologizing and actually when\npeople have a hard time apologizing they\nseem cold and like they don't care they\nactually usually just feel so ashamed of\nwhat they did and the reason I'm telling\nyou that is not because you have to take\ncare of her but just so you know this so\nwasn't you and anytime something happens\nwith mom that doesn't feel good and you\nfeel like you can't resolve it like you\ncan talk to me and I'm going to get out\nof roleplay for a sec but I think you\ncan see like I'm not throwing my wife\nunder the bus like at all um but I'm\ncentering what my kid needs what my kid\nneeds going back is they need to process\nthat experience with an adult they feel\nsafe with rather than being aloneness\nand I I often picture like this kid on\nthe couch who tells me a problem at\ntheir dad's house or at school and I\nlike go off to make a call and I picture\nthem alone being like\noh like now I'm alone like I where's\nlike I didn't really want you to go do\nthat I just wanted you to like listen to\nme you know um there might then be a\nstep two you know to kind of get on the\nsame page or when parents say get on the\nsame page I think the problem is that\nwe're not like looking at the same page\nforget getting on the same page we're\nnot even speaking the same language like\npeople say to me my partner won't even\nwatch a video with me that I just want\nto even even if they disagree that is a\nproblem and frankly that's not a\nparenting problem that's also what I'll\nsay to someone if you say to your\npartner\nlook I've been a member of good inside\nand it's been really helpful and it\nresonates and you don't have to agree\nwith it but like I would love to watch\nthis 4 minute video if your partner says\nno that has nothing to do with parenting\nthat is a core relationship problem that\nthey just don't care to do something\nthat you say is important to you that's\na that's a marriage problem that's all\nright so and I think it's really\nimportant and we talk about this a lot\nlike if that was someone I'd coach them\nto say hey and you don't have to agree\nbut if you don't commit to watching a\n4minute video with me and just talking\nabout it a little bit and I promise I'll\ntry not to be judgy or provy I'll just\nlisten I don't really think we're\ntalking about parenting I think you're\ntelling me you don't really respect me\nenough to do the things I'm asking you\nto do and that'll that'll stick with me\nlike that's the way I'd handle\nit yeah this is very\nhelpful I'm curious about these\nADHD diagnoses SLK kids cuz there's a\nlot of uh you know um loose hand\ndiagnosis this day these days um years\nago I was a camp counselor took kids\nbackpacking and I I learned an important\nconcept of um when working with\nAdolescent and teenage boys which is be\na channel not a dam you know when\nthey're super energetic like they're not\nsitting still where it's not nap time\nthere's just no way um so this notion of\ngetting it out like allowing some place\nfor physical emotional catharsis that's\nsafe obviously um and then kids have a\nlot of energy I mean damn it the adult\npopulation seems to be trying to regress\nthemselves to have that energy so how\ncan we blame them for having so much\nenergy and uh of course there are\nchildren who have uh and adults with\nclinically diagnosed ADHD that really\nstruggle but you know for the kid that's\nmore energetic U maybe even has a hard\ntime sitting still to the point of\ndiscomfort and when the rest of world\nthat we can't control is telling them\nlike hey like your kid is like needs to\nbe regulated on the subway on the bus in\nthe classroom um you know what are some\nthings that we can do in terms of\ncommunication with those kids and\nprobably some of those kids are\nlistening as well um and to just be a\nchannel not a dam to allow their best\nexpression to come forward yeah I mean I\nlove this idea in general like we it's\nmuch more effective to tell anyone what\nthey can do rather than telling them\nwhat they can't do right across the\nboard with kids because there's usually\na can that is possible and then like you\ncan work with the urge instead of I\ndon't even know trying to suppress it or\nhave it not act itself out it's it's\nlike our urges and feelings our forces\nlike they're going to they're going to\ncome out and so yes I think this idea of\nlike me and my kid are on the same team\nhere I think that's so important to\nstart with any kid definitely you know\nif you have a kid with some intentional\nyou know struggles like we're on the\nsame team you can so easily get into me\nagainst you and then you look to shut\ndown anything everything about them but\nyeah we're on the same team so let's say\nlike it's hard to do homework right now\nI see you okay like let's let's take an\namount of time and it seems like you\nhave a lot of energy like let's do some\nheavy work or let's run outside and\nmaybe homework always has to start after\na period like that maybe they need a\nbreak but this idea of yes I'm working\nwith my kid as opposed to against my kid\nis always going to be more successful\nuccessful do you think that some of the\nnew emerging tools some of which you\nknow I've talked a lot about but many\nmany people have talked a lot about um\nthings like meditation kids doing some\nlong exhale breathing um you know in\naddition to the you know the way I grew\nup it was like PE time or recess time\nyou like run around like crazy and um do\nyou think that these tools are helping\nkids get some self-regulation or is\nwhatever self-regulation they're gaining\noffset by the fact that um you know\nthere's just so much more input you know\nwe hear so much about the challenges of\nsocial media for adults but certainly\nfor kids um you know bullying obviously\nbeing one of the more salent ones but\nalso just the fact that when they go\nhome at night and they're in bed they're\npotentially still in interactions with\ntheir friends we used to have a a phone\nlandline that we' sometimes call one\nanother on but I wasn't really much of a\nphone kid uh with my friends so when\nyou're home you're home you were\nseparated from all of that I mean how\nbad is it and um what are some things\nthat parents and kids might consider\nyeah to mean meditation things like that\nlike always like icing on the cake like\nthat's always helpful and certainly like\nteaching kids real tools like those are\nlike literally something I can do I've\nlearned this meditation I have a mantra\nsomething like that like huge fan right\nyou have to be able to like touch it in\nsome way but to me I think what what's\ncoming up as you bring up this larger\npoint and it actually goes back to where\nwe started it's\nlike the cost to Children of parents not\nbeing able to set boundaries has never\nbeen\nhigher and and at the same time it's\nnever been harder for parents to set\nboundaries right and I think this stuff\nstarts way before social media like to\nme when I think about the earliest years\nof a kid's\nlife\nlike you get so much bang for your buck\nin life from helping kids just learn to\ntolerate frustration and so much of\nkids' early life right now in the world\nwe live in is all about the immediate\nescape from frustration and not only\nescape from frustration but from\nfrustration to gratification in like an\ninstant it's like so fast like how did\nthat just happen like it didn't used to\nbe like that there wasn't even an option\nlike me and you like I don't know you\nwanted a movie like I don't know maybe\nyour parent could drive you to\nBlockbuster if you had an account and\nthen like maybe I I remember going be\nlike are they going to have it are they\ngoing to have it then you see the thing\nand there's nothing behind it and you're\nlike they don't have it that whole\nthinger by the way was a video store\njust kid I'm just totally kidding I'm\ntotally kidding but some people out\nthere like I sometimes do this to myself\nyou know yeah absolutely I used to love\ngoing to pick out movies at the at the V\nVHS store but if you think about that as\none tiny thing it's obviously tiny and\nyou think about like I remember that in\nmy childhood anything about that tiny\nmoment compared to some parallel in a\nkid the there's no frustration the want\nand the gratification\nthere's zero space there is zero space\nand and also I have to say our\ngeneration of parents and me too 100% me\ntoo our tolerance for frustration has\ngone way down because of the\ngratification world we live in which\nmeans our tolerance of our kids Tantrums\nis at a all-time low because we're like\nhey my life is like pretty easy in a lot\nof ways this is like a massive\ninconvenience so kids have more\ngratification than ever we have lower\ntolerances for frustration everyone does\nwhich means the way we interact with\nkids over and over and over plus just\nthe natural things they're surround\nthey're exposed to or not like Netflix\nversus\nBlockbuster just means like their\ncircuitry around expectations and what\nfeels\ngood it like to me that's what really it\nscares me it does and like figuring out\nhow\nto tolerate or even insert like liter\ninsert frustration into your kids's life\nas early as possible to me is like is is\nis of critical\nimportance I could not agree more and\nand I say that with the understanding\nthat I have also shortened the latency\nin my reward prediction errors which is\nnerds speak for uh when I want to watch\na movie I go into Netflix and they're\nlike it's near infinite and I can get\nright then um the internet a little slow\nthen I start barking about how slow\ninternet is worse than no internet and\nyou know you start observing yourself\nand you just go oh my goodness like\nwhat's going on yeah I mean there's the\nability to tolerate different weight\ntimes between anticipation and reward is\nso critical that's what getting a degree\nis about that's what doing anything\nchallenging is about um I I've gone on\nrecord saying that um too much dopamine\nwithout effort exerted in order to get\nthat dopamine um is very detrimental\nwell that to me in all the screen time\nkind of discussion there's so much\nscreen time in social media and like all\nthe things that screen time do to for\nkids and again like my kids watch TV and\nthey're young they have iPads like I'm\nso not a purist I'm a pragmatist and\nwhoever's listening to this no one\nmessed up their kids forever okay so we\ncan just like we were talking about\nbefore use this information to make\nslightly different decisions on the\nmargin that's the best I gets but I\nthink about this when our kids are\nespecially young and they're building\nthis circuitry around like what does it\nmean to get success like what what are\nmy expectations there how much effort do\nI have to put in and I think about like\na young kid you know playing some\nmindless just dopamine giving game the\ncircuit they learn is like mindlessness\nzero effort\ndopamine and then I think and I find\nthis really interesting like how many\npeople say like their kid is six now\nthey're having a really hard time\nlearning how to read and they're all\nthese learning assessments and the\nlearning assessments are coming back\nlike no dyslexia right and I know some\nof fames I say this with love is I say I\nliterally think this is the first time\nin this kid's\nlife that they kind of have to put like\nconcerted effort without in the moment\nsuccess and so yeah that like that looks\nlike a lot of things it can it can even\npresent like ADHD right because you know\nit can present like that it might be but\nit might also just be that these\ndopamine circuits have developed in a\nway that's so that's not conducive with\nsomething like learning how to read\nright and so when parents ask me now\nlike I know reading and academic skills\nlike what can I do when my kids are\nyounger I got them flash cards no flash\ncards like I mean you can get flashcards\nthat's fine it's not like detrimental\nbut to me it's like well what is my\nkids's relationship with\nfrustration because I think about this\nthing called like the learning space\nright again them visual like there's not\nknowing how to do something and then\nthere's successfully doing something and\nthe space in between is like the\nlearning space that's what learning is\nand learning the learning space\ninherently is frustrating that's like\nthe right feeling to be\nfeeling and when kids have learned to\ncollapse those two things then like they\ndon't have a lot of space to\nlearn\nversus I don't know even like I'm\nthinking about my kid who wants to like\ndraw a rainbow son when they're young\nand they're like that doesn't look like\na son it would be easy for me to be like\nlet me just do that for you and by the\nway yes I give myself permission to do\nthat sometimes like sometimes like I\ncan't deal with this I've got other\nthings to do but sometimes I think like\nlong in that long-term greedy like this\nis going to be the same circuit for\nlearning how to read it is and for\nlearning how to do that project and what\nif my only goal forget them drawing a\nsun and I've got to tolerate The Whining\nmy only goal was just to lengthen the\namount of time they let themselves be in\nthat learning space that's it because I\nthink we know as adults it's not about\ngetting to success that comes when it\ncomes the longer amount of time you let\nyourself be in that learning space the\nmore successful you can be with hard\nthings CU like it just is right you just\ngot to Traverse through and so to me\nthat's like honestly one of the things\nI'm most passionate about teaching\nparents is like literally like what do\nyou do during that time then how do I\nchange what my goal is if my goal is to\nstop my kids tantrum I'm going to\ncollapse it but if my goal is just to l\nthat I might do something very different\noh drawing a c that's not you're right\nyou didn't want to draw that oh drawing\na circle is so hard and my kids can you\ndo it for me can you do it like of\ncourse sometimes I will but I might say\nlike I'm not going to do it sweetie I'm\nnot you know why because I know you can\ndo this a little more I have faith in\nyou and I think this is so powerful to\nsay to kids this is so frustrating and\nthat's the exact way you should be\nfeeling\nwe don't want our kids to be you should\nthat's the right feeling I'll even draw\nthat learning space visual this is where\nyou're in the this is where you are\nyou're doing an amazing job and it is\nactually interesting when kids are young\nlike they actually do adopt that like\nsomeone said to me like I've been doing\nthis stuff for a while and my kid\nliterally says to\nme I like to do hard things mom like\nthey they believe it like that's an\namazing self-belief to\ndevelop AES so yes I think this stuff\nESP\ncompared to how easy it is to get that\ngratification it's just it's like more\nimportant than ever to have an\noffset yeah I'm uh doing my best to get\nthe word out into the world that the\nonly reason the brain changes at all is\nif um there is these neuromodulators\nlike epinephrine adrenaline in the body\nand brain because that's what signals\nthat the nervous system needs to change\nif something can be accomplished there's\nno reason for the nervous system to\nchange by definition there's also I\ndon't want to spin off into a a\nneuroscience of of resilience and\nwillpower lesson here but there's some\namazing literature that um shows that\nthere's this area of the brain that\nenter mid singulate cortex which is\nactivated when people do things they\ndon't want to do um and it generalizes\nto other things but this is not the I\nlove to work out so I'm going to work\nout this is the I hate to work out and I\ndo it anyway and it translates to\nsuccess in academic Endeavors success in\nall sorts of environments and so I think\num the beauty of it is that this brain\nstructure is highly plastic and can be\nbuilt up through one thing and that\ntranslates to other so doing hard things\nexperiencing uh what I call lyic\nfriction just as as a gateway to\nlearning just understanding that it it\nalways feels hard that that's what\nlearning is in fact I can remember in\ngraduate school even as a young adult my\nmid 20s I was struggling with an\nanalysis um and my graduate adviser uh\nshe was wonderful this way and I said\nshe clearly knew how to do it and I said\num can you explain how to do this and\nshe goes nope I go what I was like just\nget done and she's like no it's called\nlearning and she just walked out she was\nalso a great parent um to her children\num and I also tried to get adopted by\nher and that failed so you know third\ntime the charm exactly my poor parents\nlike uh they they did their best and I'm\ngrateful to them for many things but I\nthink that um including the the\nencouragement to do hard things do\nthings that suck um that are beneficial\nfor us so it's it's it's a knife edge\nright now I'm reflecting it's like do\nthings that suck I believe you it sucks\nand then what what did my mom used to\nsay a lot you know hate me now love me\nlater you know I loved her then and and\nI love her now but yeah there were\nmoments where I was like I hate that\nyou're making me do this um I don't know\nabout that hate me now love me later the\nold school um but but I think what she\nwas trying to say is I have your best\ninterest in mind definitely that's right\ndefinitely yeah no definitely um can I\nsay one thing just cuz loud in my head\njust like one of the things and this\nlike I think it's easy and I'm hearing\nmyself like we hear this and I think\nit's easy to listen be like oh man I\nnever thought about it that way or I\ndidn't know that or again we just spiral\nas a parents so fast like I messed up my\nkid forever like nobody messed up their\nkid forever it doesn't matter how that\nis just not true and this is where I\nthink we can spiral into like yeah\nwhat's wrong with me and like I kind of\nasked parents in this situation to like\ncome with me to a different location\nwhich is kind of like anger and I have\nstarted to feel angry and I think angry\nanger like tells us what we need so I'm\nlike well what is that anger telling me\nlike it is it is messed up the system is\nstacked against us that when you become\na parent it is literally the hardest\nmost confusing most triggering most\nimportant job we have and we are given\nzero\nresources right like like nobody I\nknow would tell a surgeon who never went\nto med school and was struggling at\nsurgery that they were bad surgeon they'\nbe like wow like you probably like you\nprobably deserve to go to med school and\nresidency by the way like that's an\nimportant job you have and so I think\nit's easy to listen to all this and\nspiral and like oh no but I'd ask you to\nalmost like feel a little like\nprotective helpful anger next to it\nwhich is like wow like yes like this is\nan important job I have this is\ncomplicated and maybe there are\nresources out there that like I deserve\nand I think that like that's the\nperspective I would ask parents to\nlisten from earlier you described the\njob of parenting as boundaries right\nimparting boundaries as well as empathy\nand validation I just want to remind\npeople that your ba like very basic but\nvery practical uh job description for\nparenting is something that I think we\ncan return to over and over again it\nalso makes me wonder uh in thinking\nabout the um generalizability of these\nConcepts to other forms of relationship\nwhat about the relationship to self\nright it's something we don't often talk\nabout yes um relationship to self we we\nwant to have\nboundaries and we also want to be able\nto empathize and validate ourselves yeah\nand I think right like I don't know my\nfriend didn't invite me I don't know I\nfound out she had five friends for a\ndinner and I was like oh you know I'm so\nhurt I would I would say to I I believe\nmyself like I'm allowed to feel that way\nI think our feelings love when we tell\nthem they make sense I just think\nthere's something magical about that\nphrase it makes sense I'm upset I mean\nmy friends were all there and I wasn't\nthat that makes sense and and there's a\nboundary cuz when my feeling tells me\nwell I'm about to plan a dinner party\nfor 200 people and invite everyone I\nknow but her I feel like there's\nimportant like you know what feeling\nlike I'm not going to I'm not going to\nlet you go that far and the image I\nalways think about is like I'm the\ndriver of my car and all the different\nfeelings and urges like they're\npassengers and we can't get them out of\nof the car you just can't they're in\nyour body but you don't want to let them\ntake over the driver's seat that's\nreally what it is and as long as they're\na passenger they actually won't cause\nyou that many problems they'll be\nannoying and to me that's like hey I see\nyou like I see you and I will often say\nhi to my feelings for that reason like\nhi anxiety that woke me up at 400 in the\nmorning you know like yes there's a lot\nin my mind Hi and then there's like a\nboundary like you're not like you're a\npart of me and not all of me so I think\nthat phrase for regulating our own\nfeelings you're a part of me and not all\nof me is the essence of validating and\nhaving a boundary what about our need I\nthink healthy need to know whether or\nnot the lesson stuck uh so I've observed\nthis before a kid is catastrophizing\nabout an upcoming event maybe a concert\nor a test or a homework thing or a\nsocial thing and like we're using all\nour best tools to try and help them and\nI believe you I hear you then and they\ngo through the experience and they do\npretty well maybe even great and then we\nsay like did you notice you were so\nconcerned before and you you did it yeah\nyou really did it is there something\nthat we can or should do to try and\nstamp down that that recognition because\none thing that's so beautiful about\nchildhood is the um short-term Horizon\nnature of childhood we kind of like\ntrying not I mean we talk about you know\nadults trying to take it one day at a\ntime or even half a day at a time and\nkids are navigating on the basis of like\nfirst period class yeah second period\nclass I me\num they their their Horizon is often\nvery close in and I do wonder if they're\ninternalizing these these more Global\nlessons um on their own or whether or\nnot we should uh try and help them\ninternalize what they just did like do\nyou get it you were super concerned you\nwere like almost dissolving into a\npuddle of your own tears and I believe\nyou that was the appropriate response\nthen and now you did it like think about\nthat is it good that we reinforce those\nthose um those wins yeah I mean I think\nthat I think our kids do internalize\nkind of the patterns right but but I\nhear you there are these moments it's\nalmost like we want to like encapsulate\nit for them like hey that was a thing\nright I think kids pick up on whether\nour interactions were doing something\nfor them or for us so if it's from a\nlike hey that thing I taught you was\nreally helpful right like it would just\nbe like if my husband was like hey your\npresentation went well because I like\ntold you to do that thing and I'd be\nlike stop talking to me right but if he\nsaid to me hey like what was it that led\nto that it's probably like that's\nhelpful to talk out you know I'd be much\nmore open so I love the phrase going\nback to like just real tools I'm\nnoticing I think actually often we want\nto praise our kids or tell something\njust saying I'm noticing because again\nwe want to be seen we don't want to feel\ncontrolled I'm noticing does that like\nhey I'm noticing you were so worried\nabout this test we kind of talked about\nthis way of like talking to your anxiety\nand and then I'm just noticing you like\nfelt really good about how it went like\neven that I think cuz that's like the\nbiggest thing now in our like crazy fast\nworld we live in is just pausing to\nnotice that's already like encapsulating\nor saying to your kid and and I think\nlike a question is only a question when\nyou don't know the answer right like\nsometimes we ask Quest that they're just\nthey have question marks but it's like a\nstatement or criticism so if we say to\nour kid\num that that thing I taught you was\nreally helpful right do you think that's\nthat what was helpful that's not really\na question we already have an answer but\nsay hey like I just thought it would be\ngood for us to talk through for a second\nlike what was it you think that like LED\nyou to really feel good that day in the\ntest then like if I really don't know\nwhat my kid could say I think they'll\nreceive it and then they might say like\noh is that thing we talked about like\nthat's so great to know I'm even\nthinking about Spanish coming up and\nlike I wonder do you think that would\nthink I wonder is also a great phrase\nfor parents just wondering I wonder if\nthat would be helpful there again they\njust like lower defensiveness cuz\nthere's maybe there's like movement with\nwondering it doesn't feel controlling um\nso yeah I think I think there is like\nthose are nice moments if it comes from\na place of like connection not from\ncontrol that makes sense um we had a\nguest on this podcast Lisa Feldman\nBarrett who's a world expert in emotions\nand um she explained that um in cultures\nwhere there's more nuanced language for\ndifferent emotions um rather than the\nwhat I call the emogif of emotions um\nthere's better emotion tolerance um so\nunderstanding that it's not just sad\nhappy depressed uh thrilled but there's\na lot of nuance it's very context\ndependent um can be very useful um do\nyou think there's something to be gained\nfor from letting kids um explore the\nrange of emotions not just you know how\ndo you feel good or bad I mean most\nadults need to learn that good or bad\nare valuations that's not actually an\nemotion like it's not actually an\nexpression of how you feel but that's\nwhat we do shorthand\num you know do you think that let's just\nsay in the United States um but\nelsewhere perhaps as well that there's\nsome value to like teaching kids to pay\nattention like what is going on inside\nyeah like what is this feeling of what I\ncall anxiety is it excitement and\nanxiety or what like being able to\nbetter pinpoint what one is um coping\nwith but also the positive aspects of\nemotion yes I mean I it's funny I even\nthe clinical psychologist a question how\ndo you feel I always find like very like\na lot of pressure I don't know like I\nthink that's I I tend not to ask my kid\nthat but I tend also never to have asked\nlike patients that like so you know I\nthink what we're getting at is we want\nand I think this relates to resilience\nlike resilience is our ability in my\nmind to tolerate the widest range of\nemotions as possible cuz like as humans\nwe're going to feel that whole range so\nthe more of them you've learned to\ntolerate like the better off you'll be\nand so that's what I want for my kids I\ndon't know if that has to explicitly\ncome from naming although I think that\npoint is definitely true the more things\nwe can name the more things we can\nunderstand to me just showing up for\nyour kid in a way that's like with\nbelieving maybe with\nboundaries um is probably the best way\nto help your kid tolerate the widest\nrange of emotions because they learn\nthat every\nemotion like can be held in connection\nwith someone else right versus held in\naloneness and is bad um so I guess\nthat's way I think through it maybe we\ncould talk about adolescence and\nteenagers specific Al um teenage years\nare wild I always say that the single\nmost traumatic aging event and the most\nrapid rate of Aging that we ever\nexperience is puberty I mean just\nfundamentally brain circuits that were\nfor one thing or that were\ndormant change and come alive in ways\nthat the world forever will look\ndifferent to us feel different to us and\nour self-perception changes period it's\nsomething that that biologists still\nunderstand at the level of hormones and\nhypothalamic circuitry but that um has\nreally not been matched to a\npsychological understanding and vice\nversa so um like nothing is quite like\nthe music you listen to when you're a\nteenager it like it brings you back the\nmemories you form positive and negative\nstamp down boom now and forever the\nemotional salience can change but those\nare wild\nyears what are some of the more critical\nneeds of late adolescent\nand\nteens that you know are actionable um\nyeah you know and yeah I mean I'm just I\nmean my teen years were were crazy but\num even if they're less\ncrazy they're always crazy\nyes yes so and one of the reasons I\nthink at least in America that\nadolescence has seen a such a huge shift\nlike my kid is out of control they're\nalways out they're like always rejecting\nme I actually don't think is unrelated\nto the behavioral control approaches\nthat are inherent in American parenting\ncuz like you referred\nto your kid becomes 14 and they kind of\nrealize like wait I'm bigger than one of\nmy parents like I literally don't care\nabout their sticker charts anymore and\nwe might have missed 14 years of\nbuilding a\nrelationship and so what that kid's\nadolescent is going to look like is\nmarkedly different than if for those\npast 14 years you weren't giving into\neverything no but you were leading in a\nsturdier more connected way so I really\nthink this whole idea that American\nadolescence like reject everything I\nactually think not all of it a part of\nit is completely developmentally normal\nbut a big part of it relates to this\ntradition of Behavioral control that\nkids cannot reject until they're at the\nage that they kind of could survive on\ntheir own which is adolescence so I\nthink that's really important\nthe things I would tell parents to\nreally keep in mind that are critical\nnumber one is related to that like a\nteen's job is to separate and to start\nto form their own identity and I think\nthere's a couple things about that\nparents need to know number one like I\ndon't think we prepare parents enough\nfor the true sense of loss they feel\nwhen their kids are adolescent because\nthat's very real like you've just spent\nall these years and like you've driven\nthem to every soccer and they kind of\ntalk to you in the backseat and maybe\nyou have family movie nights and then\nall of a sudden they don't want any of\nthat and it's just so important parents\nto know like I'm I'm going to feel sad\nI'm going to feel lost and if we don't\nknow to expect it we often kind of\nInfuse that into a lot of anger toward\nour kid um and so I just think that's\nnormal and we should talk about that\nmore and parents of adolesent need to be\ntalking about that with each other of\ncourse you miss that that's totally\nnormal um number two related to that\nseparation if you think about identity\nformation like here's a kid and us and\nwe're kind of close and they now we're\nat the stage where developmentally their\njob at that stage is to figure out who\nthey are they have to overcorrect like\nyou have to kind of overcorrect in the\namount of space you take because it's\nreally the only way you can figure out\nlike wait maybe I do want to take parts\nof that that part's okay and so I think\nthat's like a powerful image to think\nabout like they are moving far away that\ndistance they take from you is not their\nfinal point they will move closer now\ngoing back to loss not as close as they\nused to be and that is different but\nthat's not that's this is their way of\ntrying to figure out who they\nare then the last thing I'd say that\nkind of relates that image it's like\neven as they move away I think parents\nmassively underestimate how much they\nstill need us they making efforts to\nconnect and I always think like the\ndifference between like an Explorer and\na nomad is whether or not you have a\nhome\nbase and like if our teens feel like\nNomads is not a good situation they're\nexplorers they try a million different\nthings but like they they really do need\nus they they need to know that they have\na home and um I'll never forget my\nprivate practice I I used to work with\nteens not that long ago just the teens\nsometimes the parents too and this teen\ncame to me and this was extreme she had\nbeen um really in a in a in a bad place\nwith her parents like intense intense\nconflict and um they got in this huge\nfight and she was really really upset\nand she was describing this to me she\nlike and then I was like get out of my\nget out I hate you get out you know and\nI was just like sitting there listening\nand and then she like push him out I\nslam the\ndoor and I just a couple minutes later\nopen the door my heart's racing can you\nbelieve they weren't\nthere can you believe they weren't\nthere and to me it was just this like\nand again it's not about being a\npunching\nbag but I like under like her seeming\nanger and her like intense pain were so\nclose together in her own\nstory that it's just over and over the\nsame thing like they're going to reject\nyou they're going to say get out of my\nroom and yes it sucks but they want you\nto slip a note under their door after\nyou've taken a couple minutes it says\nthat was really tough her like wow that\ngot out of control you're a good kid and\nI love you and I want to just tell\nparents of teens you're going to do that\nthere's going to be a pause and then you\nwill hear them rip up the note you will\nand like I swear to any parent that that\nstill resonated and your kid is again\ntrying to figure out how do I stay close\nwith my parents and I'm figuring out my\nown who I am so like they rip up the\nnote because like they almost like have\nto do it to like take in how much\nthey're still desperate for those bids\nfor connection sounds a lot like um the\nDynamics of adult relationships although\nhopefully\nhopefully with a little bit less um\ndramatic uh\naccentuation um but you know even if it\ndoes I mean it's like these\num these circuits that are laid down in\nchildhood Early Childhood they persist\nright I mean I think if anything's\nbecome clear to me in understanding\nbrain development and brain function\nit's that you know we don't discard\ncircuitry for attachment and go oh you\nknow that was for Mom and this one was\nfor Dad and that one was for the dog and\num and then the Romantic relationship is\ndifferent we repurpose the circuits\nhence all the beautiful work on\nchildhood attachment that's now being\ntranslated to adult attachment I mean I\nrealize there's Nuance to it but you\nknow I was um reflecting a bit on this\nagain incredibly potent um phrase or\nmention of explorers versus Nomads of\nhaving a home base and thinking about uh\nthese psychology experiments where\nchildren are observed in in the presence\nof their caretakers sometimes the\nstrange situation task where people are\nSE kids are separated from their moms\nand the mom um and child typically mom\nnoways there it's also been done with\nother caretakers and dads reunite but\none doesn't even have to know about\nthose experiments all you have to do is\ngo to a park or be out in public and see\na little toddler venturing away from\nparent and then what do they do every\nonce in a while they look back they're\njust trying to check to make sure\nthey're there even the kids that only\ntaking off on the tricycle like crazy\nyes will eventually stop and look back\nit's like this fundamental circuit we're\nlooking back you know and how far they\nfeel they can go is in direct\nrelationship to presumably the number of\ntimes that they recharged that they re\nthat they recharg and were able to see\nthat uh that verification that the\nparent was still there I think this\nnotion of explorers versus Nomads and\num being an Explorer obviously being a\ngood thing a healthy thing um within\nread reason um and Nomads just feeling a\ndrift untethered yes you know one of the\none of the scariest words at least to me\nin the um in the English language\num so the note under the door yeah um it\nincluded the words I love you I I don't\nwant to get too uh detailed here but\nthose words sometimes are never spoken\nin a home sadly um sometimes are spoken\nso often and under so many circumstances\nthat one wonders like do they lose their\npotency yeah um but I notic that in that\nnote there it finished I love you it's\nsort of like stating at the end of the\nday no matter what you say probably even\nwhat you do yeah I mean i' I've gone\nI've been in the presence of parents of\nkids that were criminals that did\nhorrible things they still love their\nkids so reminding kids that under any\nand all circumstances yeah and again and\nI think what's so critical because our\nbrain collapses is that doesn't mean you\nthink their behavior is okay and I get\nthe fear like I would never want to send\nmy kid the message that it's okay to\nquote do certain things right like that\nit's okay to just scream at your parents\nof course it's not okay it's just think\nwe missed like that happened like that\nhappened already like if I dropped my\nphone and it broke and I was trying to\nunderstand why I broke trying to\nunderstand that doesn't mean it's okay\nthat I dropped it like it just it\ndoesn't it just dropped like it already\nhappened now what you know and yeah our\nkids need to know they need to know that\nthey're loved and that again there's\nkind of like in that message I think\nlike I still see you're a good kid under\nthat moment and I actually think it's a\npowerful strategy for every parent to\nkind of conjure up a a good kid image\nlike what is it was that that last time\nwe were playing this game and it was\njust so fun or is it a memory of my kid\nwhen they were three and like I don't\nknow they did this really cute thing and\nit kind of like really cryst izes that\nand like even under you know this bad\nbehavior that kid like that kid's still\nthere and the kids the kids who behave\nthe worst are in the deepest pain I mean\nthe adults too and that's not to say\nit's okay but again we're talking about\nrelationships we want to be in like if\nyou're in a relationship with your teen\nit's not one you're like this is toxic\nlike this is my kid I'm going to be in a\nrelationship with them so you know\nremembering that they're in pain teens\nare in a lot of pain they're exploring a\nnew world frankly right now like teens\nhave world we don't understand it that's\nthat's so helpful for parents to\napproach your teen just as a tangible\ntool and say you know there's so many\nthings in your world that I don't\nunderstand and frankly probably I might\nlike criticize or judge like can you\ntake out your phone this you know\nwhatever it is this app you're on this\nvideo game like can we just even time\nbox this five minutes like I just want\nto end this conversation saying I\nunderstand it better like I promise you\nthat's probably going to do more for\nyour relationship with your kid than\nanything else because yes they do and\nthey might reject you and if you do\nagain don't take the bait but ask again\nnext week like again they they do they\nneed us to to return yeah one thing is\nfor sure none of us except those that\nare teens know what it's like to be a\nteenager in 2024 just like they didn't\nknow what it was like to be a teenager\nfor me in the late 80s early 90s how\ncould they right right so um what what\nare your thoughts on like family\nmeetings like once a week we sit down we\ncheck in you know I hear that people do\nthis may participate in the before um do\nyou feel like those can be useful or is\nit or is it more um window dressing I\nmean I guess it depends what's happening\nin there I mean the idea of like hey\nthere's a lot going on in our life and\nwe have a ritual of coming together and\ntalking things through working through\nproblems like if that's what it is\nthat's a beautiful thing like I hear\nthat my first thought is I should do\nthat you know um but you're right like\nlife gets messy so but if it's done in a\nway where it feels we end and everyone\nfeels a little bit more understood and a\nlittle bit more purpose and you know\nmaking things move forward in a positive\ndirection that's amazing I think family\nmeetings it's funny the way I think\nabout them often which is just different\nis it's actually a great strategy\nespecially when your kids are older and\num there's like somewhat of an ongoing\nconflict so maybe there's like an\nongoing conflict about how much video\ngame time or you know how much you know\nthey how late they can stay out and to\nsay to a kid and again this just comes\nfrom again so important for teens we\nhave to approach our kid like we're on\nthe same team I would say me and my kid\nagainst a problem not me against my kid\nwhere they are the problem like and so\nto say hey you've been late you know or\nwe have to figure out your curfew and\nlike look you're a smart kid you're a\ngood kid my number one job is to keep\nyou safe but you're old now and if I\njust tell you a time it's same thing\nthat happened last year we're getting\nfights all year why don't we sit down\nand we we'll do what I do at my office\nthere's two people they each have ideas\nI'm going to bring a p of paper and\nthat's actually super important and I'm\ngoing to write down all of your ideas\nand my ideas and then we're just going\nto kind of go through and cross out the\nones that you know feel completely\nunreasonable and I have a feeling when\nwe do that we're going to come to a good\nplace so again you can see there's that\nlike hope I'm giving like I hold the\npositive outcome same team I'm giving my\nkid Credit in advance this actually like\nreally Su It's usually the opposite of\nwhat teens feel which is just my parents\ndon't even listen to me or care and\nthink they have all the answers I've\nheard this notion of you know um couple\nparents come first and kids come second\nand some people are probably like what\nyou know well clearly never parented oh\nwell no actually um it's an interesting\nidea perhaps not correct or incorrect\nbut maybe Dynamic across time where the\nreal question is if kids know that they\nare running the family in terms of what\nthey do or their inability to not be\nattended to Etc um is driving the whole\nrelationship that the parents are in\nyeah versus you know recognizing and\nhere I'm I'm matching two parent home\nbut talk about divorced or people with\nsignificant others or single parent\nhomes um I've been in all of those\num you got of Wonder like are kids\nreally paying attention to how much they\nare being prioritized to the point where\nif they observe their parents tending to\ntheir own needs that they feel\ndeprivation or is it make them feel\nsafer like hey Mom Andor dad are taking\ncare of themselves and can show up\nbetter yes I think that is critically\nimportant and it kind of goes again to\nboundaries like of a parent like my\nrelationship with my kid is so important\nand I'm not going to let that take over\nme like that is not all of me I am not\nonly a caregiver to my to my kid like I\nwould stand by that all day long like is\nthat an important part of me and it's\nstill a part of me and I think this is\nreally important to own as a parent\nbecause again we tend to get a like we\nget apologist for it or we look for our\nkids permission we'll say look I need to\ngo out with Dad without you okay like we\nhave a relationship too like and we\nagain there's that job confusion and my\nkid feels that and again it's that kind\nof giving them too much power I've said\nthis to my kids a lot so they say why do\nyou go out with Dad without me I say\nit's a great question you know first of\nall dad and I were married before we had\nkids our relationship is really\nimportant to us and we love being with\nyou and being with you is different than\njust being the two of us and that really\nreally matters to us and so you don't\nhave to be happy about it you can you\nand let's say I have a babysitter I know\nthey're safe with you can cry when I\nleave and the babysitter will hold you\nand we're going to go out to dinner and\nwe're going to come back and you know\nI'll see you in the morning yeah I think\nthat is so important I actually think\nthis is another topic like this topic of\nlike rage in Parenthood is like a big\ntopic like the\nway why like why do I get to these\nmoments of Rage so often that my\nscreaming it's not just screaming at my\nkids it's really rageful and I think the\nparents often Who are the the most\nvulnerable to that are the ones\nwhere they're not make they're not\nmeeting like any of their non-caregiving\nneeds which makes sense that a part of\nthem is like screaming out like what\nabout me I used to go to dance class I\nused to see friends I used to go out\nwith my partner and talk about things\nother than you know our kids and so\nagain if I think a kids need a sturdy\nleader right more than anything else and\nsturdiness is not allowing yourself to\nbe taken over by any one thing including\nyour relationship with your kid is it\ntruly better for there to be two sturdy\nleaders than one sturdy leader I realize\nthis is a controversial question yeah I\nmean I know and I know there's research\nto back this up that like having one\nkind of sturdy leader in your life is\nmassively protective I really believe\nthat and so when parents all say my\npartner isn't I'm like we we have\nresearch this is true is two better than\none I don't know the research like\nprobably I don't know you know but what\nI think is important in there too is\nwhat's not great for kids is having like\nall the caregivers be some like\nperfectly attuned caregiver right like\nthat actually does not set up your kid\nfor life at all right because I don't\nknow anyone who thinks the partner I'm\ngoing to be with one day is going to be\nperfectly attuned to all my needs let me\ngo find that person so you know you have\none sturdy leader you have two but like\nbeing sturdy part of that is you're\ngoing to you're going to rupture you're\ngoing to rupture you're going to mess up\nyou're going to hopefully repair you\nknow after um but St I just want to make\nclear is so not the same as like\nPerfection Perfection is creepy it's not\na thing no one needs that I love that um\nit's the first time I've laughed out\nloud on this podcast about a statement\nlike that um yeah the notion of\nperfection is is kind of creepy um but\nsturdiness is anything but creepy that's\nthere's it's just such a beautiful word\nfor all the right reasons um what about\nbehavioral examples in parents so for\ninstance if children\nobserve parents um being affectionate to\none another in appropriate ways right\nyou know um you know attending to one\nanother in in boundaried but\nempathically attuned ways um do you\nthink that projects forward into their\nnotion of of what adult relationships\nare like and should be like conversely\nif parents are yelling at one another um\ndo you think that projects forward into\nit's okay to yell in adult relationships\nyeah I mean I yeah I think kids\nare they're expert noticers they notice\neverything right as part of how they've\nlearned to survive as such helpless you\nknow human so they definitely notice\nthey definitely act like sponges um so\nyes if you're you know kind of\nprivileged enough in that way to grow up\nin a home where you have parents who in\ngeneral are fairly affectionate they\ntake responsibility for their stuff they\ncommunicate in healthy way I think that\nis like a true privilege you go into\nadulthood with yes\nThe Other Extreme right you grow up with\nparents who you know they yell or they\ncan even yell in scary voices again what\nI think is really important is the\nwitnessing of that isn't going to be as\nimpactful to a kid as the witnessing of\nit and nobody naming it and talking to\nthem about it so this is why so often\nlike kids will be in different difficult\nstages intense Tantrums major issues at\nschool and someone's like what do I do\nlike what do I do with this well like I\ngive you all the strategies in the world\nbut if that is just your kids's way of\nkind of manifesting all of their\nstruggles with this like huge marital\nconflict that's happening it's not going\nto work so it's all part of the same\nsystem and so saying to your kid after\nyou fight with your partner hey I think\nyou heard Daddy and I screaming and I'm\nsure that felt scary because it does\nfeel scary because they know you're\ntheir base so if their base is of a\nhouse is like you know Feels Like An\nEarthquake it feels scary like and you\nknow another line I like it's like you\nwere right to notice that we were using\nloud voices again I think that's\nmassively confidence you know building\num maybe what was that like for you or\nif you have a little kid just that's\nenough you know and they might look at\nyou and say like can I have my snack now\nbut it's still really sunk in so if\nthere is a lot of conflict again I think\nit's really important we we talk about\nthat with our kids don't leave them\nalone what about teens that are really\nWayward um and this could be behavioral\noutbursts there's also the whole\nunderside of this thing where it's also\nabout withdrawal like the kids are\nwithdrawn I mean we were talking about\noutburst and yelling there's also the\nexample in parents or the instances in\nkids that they're just like really\nwithdrawn yes that they're just like\ndisengaged depressed depressed um maybe\neven dissociative who knows um but not\ngood and this can show up on one end is\nviolence on the other end is isolation\nit can show up as eating disorders it\ncan show up as all sorts of things um\nyou know intervention before age 18 is\nquote unquote easier in the sense that\none has legal control but oftentimes\nit's hard for parents to know like how\nbad is this yeah and you know I did an\nentire episode about cannabis and I\nspoke to some of the medical benefits of\ncannabis for adults who are non- addicts\nbut I also talked a lot about some of\nthe risks but let's take an example that\nI think is pretty common like kids 15 16\nstarts smoking some THC with their\nfriends and you go okay well everyone\ndoes that quote unquote not as bad as\nalcohol which I think is lame argument\nthis is lame doesn't make any sense yeah\nyou're getting hit by a you know car\nisn't bad as getting hit by a train but\nokay\num but the point is you\nknow most all parents like okay you\nknow clearly they're self-medicating you\nknow can't they think they can't stop\nthem but you can stop them you know at\nwhat point do you then take you know you\nput them into a residential treatment\nprogram if you could even afford that I\nmean it's really tough for people to\nknow how much to intervene in what is\nclearly not good behavior and then\nsometimes can be bad behavior and yet\nthe kids are using it to self-medicate\nand there's a peer system that sometimes\nreinforces that yes I mean this is a\nhuge landscape yeah maybe we have you\nback to talk just about this but but um\nmaybe we can um prage that discussion\nbut by um like what do you tell people\nin your in your practice like get in\nthere now pull the emergency cord and\nget this handled or do you say listen\nyou just got to work with the you know\nwork with the system tough problem I'm\nthrowing at you here but yeah I think\nthe first thing is like how do I as a\nparent like kind of even assess like\nthis like is this normal is it not\nnormal is it a problem is it not so I\nthink there's a couple like things we\ncould think about there number one just\nseeing like impact on overall\nfunctioning is always like a one\nbarometer right so okay can my child\nperform the kind of tasks of their\ndevelopmental stage okay so this is not\nthe only thing but like are they still\ngoing to school wow I noticed since they\nsmoking a they're smoking a lot of weeds\ntheir grades went from B's to D's like\nokay they don't care about school\nanymore they used to actually go out\nwith friends now unless they're with\nthis one crew where they smoke in the\npark like they're not even seeing these\nkids they used to be friends with they\ndon't want to go to family functions\nanymore they used to play soccer like if\nI'm answering this i' be like wow I'm\nnot really talking just about a\nmarijuana problem I'm talking about my\nkid not engaging in kind of like the\ndevelopmental tasks that I would say is\njust like it's time to seek additional\nsupport right another sign is just kind\nof how how limited their world has\nbecome be because of this right so again\nhas this kind of taken over everything\nthey do my kid is depressed let's say or\nyou know and all of a sudden their world\nhas gotten really really small and it's\nnot just that that's the way they've\nalways lived like there's a big there's\na big change the amount of conflict in\nthe home again like is there conflict\nwhen you have teens of course there is\nbut like wow like is it really hard to\ntalk to my teen for more than four\nminutes walking on eggshells to me is\nalso a sign that we need additional help\nam I scared to intervene in a way that\nwould actually be in line with my values\nthat's not a good sign right then the\nother thing I just want to make sure\neveryone knows is to me like seeking\nadditional help is a sign of every\nsingle thing that's right with a family\nand I think we think it's a sign of\nsomething that's wrong and it's like\nalso a sign of what's right to your in\nterms of messaging that to your kid\nagain I think about a kid who I used to\nsaw see\nmy practice she was probably 16 when she\ncame to me she was cutting serious a lot\nright and I remember saying just intake\nhey how long have you been doing this\nshe two years oh like did you see\nanother therapist before you saw me\nshe's like no she was like very like\nkind of you know kind of quippy and\nquick and I was just like why and she's\nlike well I told my parents that if they\ntook me to a therapist I would go and I\nwould just waste all their money I'd be\nquiet and then when they left me there I\nwould just leave and who's going to stop\na 14-year-old from walking away and they\nmight as well save their money because\nthey can't make me okay and again I just\nkind of sense to stay quiet and she's\nseriously one of the next things she\nsaid is can you believe they let me make\nthat\ndecision literally said that wow\nvalidates everything you set up and it\nis this is why this is where like I feel\nlike I get my best ideas like that's\nright like a 14-year-old can convince\nher parent that she won't go to therapy\nwhen she's cutting like that that is not\nokay and again then we go to okay so I'm\ngoing to say to my kid you are going I'm\nlike no there's so much between that\nwe're in these binary States your kid's\nfeelings about therapy cannot dictate\nyour boundary right but we can't just\nthen come down harshly and so I coach\nparents in this all the time what do you\nsay to a kid I love you hear me like I\nlove you we're in a tough stage I see\nthis problem and I do think even when\nour kids get older we can say this my\nnumber one job is to keep you safe\nit is not to keep you happy with me and\nI actually love you so much that I'm\nwilling to do things that make you\nunhappy with me that is actually how\nmuch I care about you and so I am going\nto be driving you and if you want to\nlike curse at me the whole time I will\nsit in that waiting room and you know\nwhat I'm going to do the next week I'm\ngoing to tell you I love you I'm going\nto do the same thing and I think adults\nhearing that on some level there's some\ninternal truth of like I probably need\ndid that like that feels oddly good\nbecause there's like you know I'm not\nmessing around but there's this way\nwhere as parents we've said like the way\nto show my kid I'm not messing around is\nto be mean to them like there was\nnothing mean about what I said I think\nit was more loving than saying to a kid\nokay let me know when you want to go\nthat is not loving and so I think like\nour teens sometimes in those moments\nthey need us to do our job and like be\nthe pilot like they it is this small\namount of time where they're still a\npassenger when they're 18 they are the\npilot and so we have this window there's\nnothing I want to probe more into that I\nthink you you captured it beautifully\nand uh it gets back to this issue of\nsafety like in letting them make their\nown decision when they're clearly in\ntrouble like if anything could make a\nkid feel unsafe a teen or or younger or\nadult it's that yes yes it's like laying\nthe passenger on the plane be like hey\ninstead of uh rerouting how about you\njust come up here and fly that's that's\nexactly that's literally what it is and\nthey're like like I can't believe you\nbelieved my little protest now I'm in\nthe cockpit like this sh they don't they\ndon't want that that's why their words\nteens words it's not that we don't\nbelieve them like as you see I'm big un\nbelieving their words often are a\nrepresentation of their fears all of us\nin our worst moments get out like I feel\nlike sometimes like that's their fear or\nlike they're kind of talking to their\nemotion they're so like they're not\nreally talking to you in that moment\nthey're so disregulated and like just\nlearning to like not take it so\nliterally and be like what am I really\nbelieving my kid isn't pain they're\ncutting my kid isn't pain they're\nsmoking weed 30 times a day and don't go\nto class like I'm the like I know that\nthey that they need help and again any\nparent who can say that like to me is\nlike the strongest parent and that is\nsuch a sign of Health I don't think I'd\nstill uh be alive today if it wasn't for\num non-parent mentors and just examples\nin the world these aren't always people\nthat were like hey I'm going to take you\nunder my wing and be your Mentor\nactually those was rarely the case but\npeople in my real life or in my um you\nknow reading or you know there wasn't\nYouTube back then but um sometimes now\nyou know people have I'm a huge fan for\ninstance of these a yian psychologist\nJames Hollis who has these beautiful\nlectures on on making a life um and I'm\nlearning so much like I consider him a\nmentor sorry James you didn't have a\nchoice you're you're a mentor but these\npeople that we can internalize certain\nhealthy aspects that our parents just\njust apparent ly can't seem to arrange\nfor themselves and that we wish they had\nbut I think that we um as children of\nall ages um like we want perfect parents\nwe don't get them um but it seems\nappropriate to me I love your thoughts\nit seems appropriate to me to have you\nknow kind of a a foraging for examples\nof where we can get certain things that\nwe can internalize for ourselves so that\nwe can benefit that maybe our parents\njust aren't interested in capable of or\neven alive to provide us anymore yeah\nyeah I mean that like being everything\nto someone\nlike I don't want my kids to ever say\nthat about me my mom was everything she\nfulfilled my every need again I I do\nfind that creepy whenever I don't know\nand like and just setting them up for so\nmuch relationship\ndisappointment um my mom gave some\nthings and you know we now that I also\nwork a lot of funny with my kids like\nthere is this Mom like when kids have a\nsleepover at our house I mean it is the\nbest sleepover experience like I see\npictures I'm like wow that was so\nthoughtful that was amazing she's like\nshe puts together she's creative like\nand me and my kids joke like they're\nlike yeah Mom you you're like bottom of\nthe list and that stuff and I am I am\nand like I know I'm toward the top of\nthe list and other things I don't I\ndon't want to be toward first of all I\ndon't want to hold myself to that\nstandard that's like a great way to\nimplode so yeah being able to say to my\nkid oh you guys want to have a sleepover\nyou'd rather go to her house cuz that's\nokay like that's not an indictment of me\nand so maybe this is some quote Mentor\nlike figure for someone who can like put\nthese details and make people feel\nreally taken care of in that way that's\ngreat and I think yes giving your kid\npermission and encouragement again I\nthink is such a gift to them later on\nlike yeah our relationship with our kids\nbecomes not only the foundation their\nexpectations for their relationship with\nother adults me I also think it's\nliterally what they're attracted to I\nthink when they're attracted to someone\nlater on it's just the activation of\nthat like earliest attachment and so if\nthey can get activated around someone\nwho seems to be pretty attuned and\nrespectful and\nvalidating and boundar because they also\nhave other things in their life and not\neverything like that's a privilege to\nsay that's what I'm expecting so I think\nthose other relationships and as a\nparent to hear your kids say my coach\ntaught me this thing and sometimes they\nsay it in a caddy way so much better\nthan what you said to do at lacrosse\njust to like take a deep breath and\nagain this is where you can say like\nlike I'm still a good parent even\noutside this moment like that's I'm so\nglad you're talking to me about this I\nbelieve you tell me more about this like\nsuch a beautiful example for your kid so\nbeing able to uh validate and embrace\nthe fact that there are other sources of\nhealthy\nupbringing um is you know not just\nperhaps is is clearly a good thing do I\nhave that right I think that's right and\nI think if that's hard for a parent what\nI'd say is like it's a question without\nan exact answer but like where where did\nI learn that I'm supposed to be\neverything to someone like and is that\nand I think a lot of women we learn that\nin our families of origin to be good\ngirls which really just means I have no\nwants and needs of my own and I just\nkind of gaze out and see how I can do\nthings for you and I can be everything\nfor you and then we have kids we don't\nrealize we put that on to them but like\nyou said those patterns travel with us\nand I find it like very relieving to be\nlike maybe what if I don't wow just gave\nme like a good percentage of energy back\nlike I can I can do like so many other\nthings now you know it's very it's like\nempowering I love\nit something that it's an unpleasant\ntopic just by as soon as people hear the\nword but it's something that I think\ncomes up on the child side the teen side\nand the parenting side and in adult\nrelationships of all kind which is the\ndreaded entitlement o dirty word\nparenting entitlement um maybe we could\nput some definition on entitlement and\ntalk about um when it's bad is it always\nbad uh when it's neutral and when it's\num I don't know is it ever good I\nentitlement doesn't sound like it's ever\ngood but yeah I Health there is a\nhealthy entitlement right and I think\nthat is kind of the entitlement to like\nI'm allowed to want things and I'm\nallowed to at moments in my life even\nact on that to turn that want into a\nfulfillment of my want I think that\nactually goes back to what we were just\nsaying like versus how can I please you\nlike maybe I want to do something so I\nthink that healthy entitlement that's a\ngood thing but when I think when I hear\nparents say like please I just don't\nwant an entitled kid they're not talking\nabout that right and they're talking\nabout and to me the story from my\npractice is just the key thing that\nmakes us parents cringe was this family\nof sing in New York City and they they\nwere they were very wealthy and they had\nthe 16-year-old son and they were flying\nI think back from Hawaii or to Hawaii\nand they were just getting ready to\nboard and first class was boarding and\nthe sun goes up and they're like oh we\nwere not like in first class we have to\nwait he had a basically a full tantrum\nin the airport like every parents worst\nnightmare literally and they came to me\nafterwards being like how did we like\nhow did we get here right now this is a\nfamily in general true they they flew\nfirst class they had private plans had a\nlot of you know money but entitlement to\nme doesn't always have to be about money\nI'm going to give you my definition of\nentitlement I think it's very different\nbut to me the definition like boundaries\nis useful because it gives you a pathway\nof what to\ndo I think entitlement is the fear of\nfrustration\nbeautiful because if we go back okay\nthat thing didn't start at 16 and if we\nwe started you know I started kind of\ncollecting stories and right this is a\nkid who they had and again like they had\na driver there's nothing wrong with\nhaving a driver but I'm just thinking\nabout like waiting for a Subway it's\nfrustrating just missed the subway we're\ngoing to be late like no right this was\na kid who didn't make instead get older\nremember like they make the soccer team\ndon't worry we have someone who's going\nto take you to the nearby Town New\nJersey and get on that soccer team right\num and I think about what this kid\nstarted to learn about being\nfrustrated and it was kind of like\nfrustration comes up and what gets\nlayered next to it is someone else\nbringing you an exit frustration exit\nfrom frustration maybe even exit to\nsuccess right and then I started to\nthink like what would it be like if\nthere was 16 years of kind of because\nthis doesn't happen of that pattern in\nthat circuit reinforcing cuz what you're\nreally learning as a kid I'm frustrated\nand that's very overwhelming for me but\nlike the adults around me must be scared\nof my frustration because they won't let\nme sit in it they won't let me feel it\nthey will actually kind of run in\ncircles to to not have me feel so I\nactually encode my frustration next to\nfear now I'm 16 and I'm expecting first\nclass and I get you know lowly coach you\nknow it's not people are like oh what a\nspoiled kid like I actually I I feel\nlike this kid was like insanely\nvulnerable in that moment this kid was\nlike I'm frustrated and what I expect to\nhappen and what I know to happen isn't\nhere and so it is explosive it appears\nas entitlement on the surface but it is\na deep intolerance and almost fear of\nfrustration which is in your body so\nyou're terrified of a feeling that is\nliving in your body and it looks\ndemanding because it kind of is\ndesperate like you can't let this\nhappen\nwow fear of frustration as the\ndefinition of an entitlement uh lands\nlike Square in the bullseye for me um\nand yes I think we all default to the\nkind of stereotypical example of the the\nultra wealthy family kid uh there was\nthat movie the toy in the 80s it really\nDreadful concept actually you know a kid\nthat was just given everything and then\nwanted a person I it's really like talk\nabout foul I mean it's just you know\njust bad at every level and then they\ntried to you know create this narrative\nwhere then you know there's a\nunderstanding about humans and stuff\nthat evolves from it but but the\nstarting point was you know and I I've\nobserved this in certainly not my family\nbut other families where kids are given\neverything they want it never feels like\nenough big surprise dopamine is a real\nthing the circuits recalibrate to a\nhigher threshold they want more and more\nand more it's like that movie Wall\nStreet what's your number more okay all\nright um nothing wrong with wanting\nthings uh but with without a sealing on\nany of that and without a sealing on on\nPleasure bounds on experience it crushes\neverybody that's also what that movie\nwas about it just crushes people yeah so\nto build that into a child's neurology\njust seems like the worst possible thing\nU because it's not about the world being\na place of immense possibility it's\nabout the world being a place of of like\nsnakes and broken glass everywhere\nexcept this narrow Edge path that you\nfollow that is all about infinite\nresources and ease that's right and I\nwhen I think it's fear is because if\nyou're in fear you're in like a threat\nstate which is why it when kids are in\nthat state or adults it seems like nasty\nlike and it's mean when you're you know\nand there's this like narrowing of your\neyes right so I think that's really you\nknow what's happening and it's not it's\nnot always tied to money but the truth\nis and like money can easily IL buy a\nkid's way out of frustration and by the\nway it buys the parent out of having to\ntolerate their frustration while the kid\nis frustrated and so It's Tricky I think\nI've I've now like you know talked to a\nbunch of parents who grew up in um a\nvery different way were very successful\nand I get it they're like I feel like\nI've I've earn i' literally have earned\nthe right to have certain parts of my\nlife be a lot easier right and like how\ndo I though not how do I raise a kid who\nisn't entitled right and it is a\nconundrum right like I think like you\nknow we raise our raise our kids in a\ncandy store it's hard to expect them to\nappreciate candy right and so like how\ndo we how do we balance that gratitude\nthe entitlement and I do think though\nthat idea is like we just have to and\nsometimes like other people hearing this\nwould be like yeah like my life is\nfrustrating all the time and some\npeople's are right they won't end up\nwith entitlement but for other families\nthey almost have to be like I I have to\nlike dose it I have to make sure my kids\nliterally have experiences and I\nprobably have to go through it too where\nwe are almost like\npurposefully making sure they get enough\nof that you know so they can build\ndifferent\ncircuits yeah so much done P there I I\nthink\num it's clear that some of this is tied\nto financial means um I think it's a\nit's a pretty scary thing when someone\nlooks out on the landscape of the world\nas infinite possibility um without any\nfrustration um as we talked about\nearlier the ability to lean into hard\nthings as as a skill that can extend to\nother things is is so valuable do you\nthink that some of the smaller practices\nthat any kid any parent any family\nregardless of means can lean into can\nreally help there like like like um you\nknow some people say grace or a prayer\nbefore a meal others simply Express\ngratitude but you know stopping thinking\nabout you know I mean being breathing\nbring being ambul atory being any number\nof of good things that allow us agency\nin life um about to eat food I mean\nthose those moments I I think I think\nare I know that our our nervous system\nreflects on those yeah how could they\nnot and just recognizing that at least\nsomething went into the creation of the\nthe meal I think for like the\nentitlement stuff and the frustration\nlike there's all these small moments\nthat we can start to make a difference\nand I think it's saying to yourself just\ncuz I can doesn't mean I will so like my\nkids young and I pick them up from a\nplay date and I let's say I have a\nbabysitter at home or my husband at home\nand I'm like I have to go to a store and\nsome errands my like can you drop me off\nfirst maybe I'm like you know what like\nno like you're going to come with me and\nI'm not going to say it this way but on\nboring errands because you just have to\ntolerate that like sometimes you have to\ndo things you don't want to do and like\nyou're not going to learn that by me\ntelling you that you're going to learn\nthat by experiencing that you know\nsomething with my kids you know the\nother day we were at an airport and like\nthere were you know in the airport like\nit kind of winds around like to get and\nthere was like no one there so they\nstarted to like duck under all the like\nthings and it just made me think like as\na small Moment Like entitlement also was\nlike the rules don't apply to me and\nsome ways I was like and I just remember\nyou guys when we're in airports oh the\nthe the lines leading up to security you\nyou like mess them up and it wasn't like\nforever but I was like you guys like\nthese things someone put these here for\na reason we're just going to it's like a\nlike I these things have to be such it's\na small amount of frustration but it's\njust like I don't always get to duck the\nline sometimes I have to like walk a\nlittle longer or I remember my kids\nsaying and I'm not immune to this like I\nam in a financial position where I have\nsomeone come sometimes help me be my\nhousekeeper right and she'll fold the\nlaundry and I remember on a Sunday my\nson said to me when he was younger like\nwhy do we have to fold the laundry kind\nof like I don't think he said it but he\nwas kind of like don't we have someone\nyou know who could do that and I\nremember being like this is a moment or\nI could be like we're going to fold the\nlaundry on Sundays you know who loves\nfolding laundry maybe some people like I\ndon't I don't love undoing the\ndishwasher it is inherently not that\nenjoyable but like and it's all\nfrustrating it's just like not great and\nlike I know I need to make my kids do\nthat like they just have to go through\nthat mundane thing um and so I think\nthere's all of these moments taking your\nkid with you on errands you know doing\nthe laundry right before you say to your\nkid let's go to try out on another\nsoccer team just like oh you didn't make\nthe team maybe maybe Let It Go two days\nthat's at least two more days of feeling\nupset and frustrated right they don't\nhave to be these big Grand things but\nall of those little moments can add up\nin a really positive way what's your\nstance on household chores and should\nkids be paid for household chores um yes\nI have a whole guide to chores and\nallowance and I actually you know I\nthink there's a lot of thought like\nshould they be separate I don't know I\nthink it could be done either way but to\nme the question for a parent is like\nwhat is the point for me like what is my\ngoal for chores what is my goal for\nallowance right and I think that has to\nthen structure how we do it so my\nguesses for chores part of it is I want\nmy kid to number one maybe like help\naround the house want them to have that\npurpose also like I know for me for\nchores like sometimes your life involves\ndoing boring things that is just true\nand like I want my kids to know that\nwhich means they have to experience it\nthat's one of the reasons we do chores\nso for me if that's one of the reasons\nI'm not going to hey my kid because for\nme in my family what I think my kids\nneed to get out of it is just like\nknowing that sometimes you do boring\nthings that's part of being a good human\nfor someone else that might be totally\ndifferent so I think we just ask\nourselves as parents like what am I\ntrying to accomplish and then let me\nstructure it around that across the\ncourse of today's discussion I I've been\nfeeling both immense gratitude uh and\nrelief for certain uh quote unquote\nhardships that I experienced um and\nthings that my parents Made Me Do or\nways that they were negligent and I was\nforced to figure things out also um you\nknow some things so I was like oh like\nwish they had done this I think everyone\nlistening to this will feel that way um\nand if you're lucky enough to still be\nin the parenting child ring or being a\nchild process then uh there's still time\nso I guess there's always still time um\nin my introduction to this episode I I\ntouched on a few of these but um tell us\nwhat you're doing these days to help\nparents and kids yeah um indirectly or\ndirectly to be more effective in their\nrelationships and um and you know I know\nyou you've written about this in books\nand you have a a wonderful social media\naccount on Instagram and elsewhere I\nfollow it um and it's there's oh so much\nlearning there but um you know how are\nyou translating this knowledge into um\nactionable programs yeah that is my like\nthat is what gets me out of bed every\nmorning is translating I always say deep\nthoughts actionable practical can do it\ntoday strategies yes that's that's the\nonly way I can work I'm like tell me\nwhat to do to put that idea into action\nlove it\nso you know a couple years ago one of\nthe things that really struck me I just\nlike I really did feel angry like this\nis so messed up we parents have the\nhardest job and it's the one that\nimpacts the world the most and I don't\nthink any of us think the world is in\nlike a great place right now right it's\nnot right and this is and I remember\nsomeone coming up to me and saying\nparenting is also the only job you care\nabout on your deathbed and I think\nthat's probably true if you have kids so\nlike for every reason this should be the\nplace that they're like that we invest\nthe most or that the system is like set\nup to help us right and most people I\nknow they don't want to parent the exact\nsame way as they were parented maybe\ntake parts and that is the way we'll\nparent it's just kind of the language we\nuse and learning a new language we know\nis totally possible Right dual lingo has\nshowed us that you can learn a new\nlanguage it's hard sometimes you revert\nto your language of origin especially in\nstressful moments same thing in\nparenting and then you go back and so I\nremember saying to some people around me\nlike I want to create that like kind of\ndual lingo for parents it is learning a\nnew language and we should have a\nproduct where we have resources in one\nplace we should be able to connect to\nother parents around the globe who are\nkind of doing this with us we should\nhave access to experts we trust not\nbecause they always know better but they\nmight just help us have a different\nmindset and some ideas to help us again\nand me my mind is just act more in line\nwith your own values that's what it's\nabout and so that's what we created and\nthat's what I'm working on and that's\nour good inside membership and so\nexcited about all the ways you know\nthat's already impacting tens and tens\nof thousands of parents and that's where\nthe resources are it's bite size it's\nactionable we're really known for our\nscripts it's like what do I say to my\nkid when like literally ioke like we\nhave a script for that um and I think in\na small way people like say like I come\nfor the scripts and then I stay for the\nrevolution like this is actually a\njourney of my own sturdiness and\nhonestly becoming a sturdier more\nconfident leader is the only way we can\nraise sturdy more confident\nkids well I've said this again and again\nthroughout today's discussion but I love\nit I love the Gathering of it
