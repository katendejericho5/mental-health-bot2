    "transcript": "Let's talk about oral health.\nMost all, not all, but\nmost, all mouthwashes,\nespecially those containing alcohol,\nare terrible for oral health.\nNo specific food, not even\nsugar, causes cavities.\nCavities are caused by\nbacteria that feed on sugar.\nThe real big question\nwith toothpaste is always,\nshould I use a toothpaste\nthat has fluoride,\nor avoid toothpastes that have fluoride?\nSome people, I remember\nthis in college, would say,\n\"Oh, you know, if you've got a, you know,\n\"you've got a, like scratch,\nin the back of your throat,\n\"you're getting sick, you\nknow, you should drink.\"\nAnd that's what they said,\n\"You should drink, it's going\nto kill that thing off.\"\nWell, guess what?\nIt does the exact opposite.\nSo xylitol is a very potent\ntool for improving oral health.\nSo I strongly suggest\nthat all of us take a look\nat what we are currently doing\nfor our tooth and oral health,\nand consider what\nmodifications are best for us."
